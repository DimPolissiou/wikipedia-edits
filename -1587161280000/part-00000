William was born in Adamstown NSW Australia to Coral Bird and William Cooper. He had one brother, Buddy Cooper.  He trained originally as a landscape and seascape artist but achieved renown through [[natural history]] scientific illustrations, especially of birds. Cooper also became a qualified taxidermist in his teenage years.\n\n==Life==\nThe first book for which Cooper supplied the pictures was ''Portfolio of Australian Birds'', written by [[Keith Hindwood]] in 1967. Later, he illustrated ''Parrots of the World'', ''Birds of Paradise and Bowerbirds'', ''Australian Parrots'', ''Kingfishers and Related Birds'', ''The Cockatoos (a Portfolio of all Species)'', and ''Turacos (a Portfolio of all Species)'' all authored by [[Joseph Forshaw]].\n\nIn 1992 the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, presented Cooper with its gold medal for \"artistic endeavors and life's work which have contributed to mankind's better understanding and appreciation of living things\".  He was the first Australian recipient in the academy's 190-year history. Then, in 1994, Cooper was awarded the Order of Australia (AO) for his contribution to art and natural history.<ref>[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=870161&search_type=simple&showInd=true It's an Honour]. Retrieved 11 May 2015</ref>\n\nCooper's work is held in many collections and institutions around the world, including the [[National Library of Australia]]. Papua New Guinea's government purchased entire collections of his published works and commissioned from him two sets of postage stamps. He also illustrated ''Visions of a Rainforest'' by Stanley Breeden and ''Fruits of the Australian Tropical Rainforest'' by Wendy Cooper. In 2011 he wrote and illustrated ''Capturing the Essence'', a book that illustrates and describes techniques for artists.\n\nThe hard-won knowledge of his subjects which Cooper acquired is evident in his paintings, which display extreme precision, and he usually insisted on painting the birds in their distinct natural environments, down to the exact foods they eat.  Preferring to draw from life, rather than depending on photographs as the main source of material for his work, he would often venture into wild, untamed parts of the world to capture the exact display of the birds he painted. He lived with his wife, Wendy Cooper, a self-taught botanist who has authored two substantial books, in north Queensland where his studio was surrounded by tropical rainforest.\n\nSir [[David Attenborough]] described Cooper as \"Australia's greatest living scientific painter of birds; he is possibly the best in the world\". In 1993, Sir David made a film about Cooper, called ''Portrait Painter to the Birds''.  A biography, ''An Eye For Nature&nbsp;\u2014 The Life and Art of William T. Cooper'', written by [[Penelope Diane Olsen|Penny Olsen]] and published by The [[National Library of Australia]], was launched in February 2014. Olsen described Cooper as \"one of the finest bird illustrators ever.\"<ref name=Emu>Penny Olsen (2015) [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1071/MUv115n3_OB \"William Thomas Cooper 6 April 1934\u201310 May 2015\"] ''[[Emu (journal)|Emu -\nAustral Ornithology]]'', '''115'''(3): 282-284. doi: 10.1071/MUv115n3_OB.</ref>\n\nWilliam Cooper was married twice, first to Marie MacEnearney and then Wendy Elizabeth Price. In December 2014, Cooper and his wife Wendy both received Honorary Doctorates from the [[Australian National University]]: Bill for his contributions at the intersection between art and science, and Wendy for her botanical research.<ref name=Emu/> Cooper died at his home in [[Malanda, Queensland]], on 10 May 2015.<ref name=\"ABC death\">{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-12/queensland-bird-illustrator-william-cooper-dies-at-home/6462116|title=Bird illustrator William Cooper dies at home in far north Queensland - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)|last=Sexton-McGrath|first=Kristy|date=12 May 2015|work=[[ABC Online]]|publisher=Australian Broadcast Corporation|language=English|accessdate=12 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Illustrated Art works==\nBooks illustrated by Cooper include:\n* 1968 \u2013 ''A Portfolio of Australian Birds'' (text by [[Keith Alfred Hindwood|Keith Hindwood]])\n* 1973 \u2013 ''Parrots of the World'' (text by [[Joseph Forshaw]])\n* 1975 \u2013 ''The Year of the Koala'' (text by H.D.

Then, in 1994, Cooper was awarded the Order of Australia (AO) for his contribution to art and natural history.<ref>[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=870161&search_type=simple&showInd=true It's an Honour]. Retrieved 11 May 2015</ref>\n\nCooper's work is held in many collections and institutions around the world, including the [[National Library of Australia]]. Papua New Guinea's government purchased entire collections of his published works and commissioned from him two sets of postage stamps. He also illustrated ''Visions of a Rainforest'' by Stanley Breeden and ''Fruits of the Australian Tropical Rainforest'' by Wendy Cooper. In 2011 he wrote and illustrated ''Capturing the Essence'', a book that illustrates and describes techniques for artists.\n\nThe hard-won knowledge of his subjects which Cooper acquired is evident in his paintings, which display extreme precision, and he usually insisted on painting the birds in their distinct natural environments, down to the exact foods they eat.  Preferring to draw from life, rather than depending on photographs as the main source of material for his work, he would often venture into wild, untamed parts of the world to capture the exact display of the birds he painted. He lived with his wife, Wendy Cooper, a self-taught botanist who has authored two substantial books, in north Queensland where his studio was surrounded by tropical rainforest.\n\nSir [[David Attenborough]] described Cooper as \"Australia's greatest living scientific painter of birds; he is possibly the best in the world\". In 1993, Sir David made a film about Cooper, called ''Portrait Painter to the Birds''.  A biography, ''An Eye For Nature&nbsp;\u2014 The Life and Art of William T. Cooper'', written by [[Penelope Diane Olsen|Penny Olsen]] and published by The [[National Library of Australia]], was launched in February 2014. Olsen described Cooper as \"one of the finest bird illustrators ever.\"<ref name=Emu>Penny Olsen (2015) [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1071/MUv115n3_OB \"William Thomas Cooper 6 April 1934\u201310 May 2015\"] ''[[Emu (journal)|Emu -\nAustral Ornithology]]'', '''115'''(3): 282-284. doi: 10.1071/MUv115n3_OB.</ref>\n\nWilliam Cooper was married twice, first to Marie MacEnearney and then Wendy Elizabeth Price. In December 2014, Cooper and his wife Wendy both received Honorary Doctorates from the [[Australian National University]]: Bill for his contributions at the intersection between art and science, and Wendy for her botanical research.<ref name=Emu/> Cooper died at his home in [[Malanda, Queensland]], on 10 May 2015.<ref name=\"ABC death\">{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-12/queensland-bird-illustrator-william-cooper-dies-at-home/6462116|title=Bird illustrator William Cooper dies at home in far north Queensland - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)|last=Sexton-McGrath|first=Kristy|date=12 May 2015|work=[[ABC Online]]|publisher=Australian Broadcast Corporation|language=English|accessdate=12 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Illustrated Art works==\nBooks illustrated by Cooper include:\n* 1968 \u2013 ''A Portfolio of Australian Birds'' (text by [[Keith Alfred Hindwood|Keith Hindwood]])\n* 1973 \u2013 ''Parrots of the World'' (text by [[Joseph Forshaw]])\n* 1975 \u2013 ''The Year of the Koala'' (text by H.D.

Parker was a blazingly fast virtuoso, and he introduced revolutionary harmonic ideas including rapid passing chords, new variants of altered chords, and chord substitutions.

He was the only child of Charles Parker and Adelaide \"Addie\" Bailey, who was of mixed [[Choctaw]] and African American background.{{sfn|Haddix|2013}} He attended [[Lincoln College Preparatory Academy|Lincoln High School]]{{sfn|Woideck|1998|p=4}} in September 1934, but withdrew in December 1935, just before joining the local musicians' union and to pursue his musical career full-time.{{sfn|Haddix|2013|p=19}} His childhood sweetheart and future wife, Rebecca Ruffin, graduated from Lincoln High School in June 1935.\n\nParker began playing the saxophone at age 11, and at age 14 he joined his high school band where he studied under Bandmaster Alonzo Lewis. His mother purchased a new alto saxophone around the same time. His father, Charles Sr., was often required to travel for work, but provided some musical influence because he was a pianist, dancer and singer on the [[Theater Owners Booking Association]] (T.O.B.A.) circuit. He later became a [[Pullman Company|Pullman]] waiter or chef on the railways. Parker's mother Addie worked nights at the local [[Western Union]] office.{{sfn|Giddins|2013|pp=21\u201323}} His biggest influence at that time was a young [[trombone]] player named Robert Simpson, who taught him the basics of improvisation.{{sfn|Woideck|1998|p=8}}\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Bird's sax NMAAHC-2019.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Alto sax owned and used by Charlie Parker, now at the [[Smithsonian Institution]]]]\n===Early career===\nIn the mid-1930s, Parker began to practice diligently. During this period he mastered improvisation and developed some of the ideas that led to the later development of [[Bebop]]. In an interview with [[Paul Desmond]], Parker said that he spent three to four years practicing up to 15 hours a day.<ref>{{cite web |title=Paul Desmond Interviews Charlie Parker (1954) |url=https://bobreynoldsmusic.com/paul-desmond-charlie-parker/ |website=Bob Reynolds |accessdate=11 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.puredesmond.ca/pdbird.htm |website=Puredesmond.ca |accessdate=March 1, 2011 |title=Paul Desmond interviews Charlie Parker |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706194036/http://www.puredesmond.ca/pdbird.htm |archivedate=July 6, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nBands led by [[Count Basie]] and [[Bennie Moten]] certainly influenced Parker. He played with local bands in jazz clubs around Kansas City, Missouri, where he perfected his technique, with the assistance of [[Buster Smith]], whose dynamic transitions to double and triple time influenced Parker's developing style.\n\nIn late spring 1936, Parker played at a jam session at the Reno Club in Kansas City. His attempt to improvise failed when he lost track of the chord changes. This prompted [[Jo Jones]], the drummer for Count Basie's Orchestra, to contemptuously throw a cymbal at his feet as a signal to leave the stage.{{sfn|Haddix|2013|p=21}} However, rather than discouraging Parker, the incident caused him to vow to practice harder, and turned out to be a seminal moment in the young musician's career when he returned as a new man a year later.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/17/charlie-parker-cymbal-thrown|title=A teenage Charlie Parker has a cymbal thrown at him|first=John|last=Fordham|date=June 16, 2011|website=the Guardian}}</ref> Parker proposed to his wife, Rebecca Ruffin, the same year and the two were married on July 25, 1936.<ref>Anita Dixon, \"Charlie Parker, 'I was his first, he was my first, it was all special,\" Pitch Weekly (KCMO), April 10, 1996</ref> In the fall of 1936, Parker traveled with a band from Kansas City to the Ozarks for the opening of Clarence Musser's Tavern south of Eldon, Missouri. Along the way, the caravan of musicians had a car accident and Parker broke three ribs and fractured his spine.{{sfn|Haddix|2013|p=24}} The accident led to Parker's ultimate troubles with pain killers and opioids, especially heroin. Parker struggled with drug use for the rest of his life.\n\nDespite his near death experience on the way to the Ozarks in 1936, Parker returned to the area in 1937 where he spent some serious time [[woodshedding]] and developing his sound.{{sfn|Haddix|2013}}{{sfn|Crouch|2013}} In 1938 Parker joined pianist [[Jay McShann]]'s [[territory band]].{{sfn|Woideck|1998|p=18}} The band toured nightclubs and other venues of the southwest, as well as Chicago and New York City.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/jazz/biography/artist_id_parker_charlie.htm |title=pbs.org |publisher=pbs.org |accessdate=March 10, 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://amb.cult.bg/music/jazz/mp3/notes/CHARLI.htm amb.cult.bg] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221093817/http://amb.cult.bg/music/jazz/mp3/notes/CHARLI.htm |date=December 21, 2007 }}</ref> Parker made his professional recording debut with McShann's band.\n\n===New York City===\nIn 1939 Parker moved to New York City, to pursue a career in music. He held several other jobs as well. He worked for nine dollars a week as a dishwasher at Jimmie's Chicken Shack, where pianist [[Art Tatum]] performed.<ref>See ''[[Jazz (TV series)|Jazz]]'', Episode 7: \"Dedicated to Chaos: 1940\u20131945\".</ref>  It was in 1939 in New York that Parker had his musical breakthrough that had begun in 1937 in the Missouri Ozarks. Playing through the changes on the song \"Cherokee\", Parker discovered a new musical vocabulary and sound that forever shifted the course of music history.\n\nIn 1940, he returned to Kansas City to perform with Jay McShann and to attend the funeral of his father, Charles, Sr. He played Fairyland Park in the summer with McShann's band at 75th and Prospect for all-white audiences. The up-side of the summer was his introduction to Dizzy Gillespie by Step Buddy Anderson near 19th and Vine in the summer of 1940.{{sfn|Haddix|2013}}{{sfn|Crouch|2013}} After the summer season at Fairyland, Parker left with McShann's band for gigs in the region. On a trip to Omaha he earned his nickname from McShann and the band after an incident with a chicken and the tour bus.\n\nIn 1942 Parker left McShann's band and played for one year with [[Earl Hines]], whose band included [[Dizzy Gillespie]], who later played with Parker as a duo. This period is virtually undocumented, due to [[1942\u201344 musicians' strike|the strike of 1942\u20131943]] by the [[American Federation of Musicians]], during which time few professional recordings were made. Parker joined a group of young musicians, and played in after-hours clubs in Harlem, such as [[Clark Monroe's Uptown House]]. These young iconoclasts included Gillespie, pianist [[Thelonious Monk]], guitarist [[Charlie Christian]], and drummer [[Kenny Clarke]]. The beboppers' attitude was summed up in a famous quotation attributed to Monk by [[Mary Lou Williams]]: \"We wanted a music that they couldn't play\" (the \"they\" here are white bandleaders, who had taken over swing music, and made money from it.)<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=byShDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT467&lpg=PT467 |title=The History of Jazz and the Jazz Musicians|last=Nicholas|first=Aurwin|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781365838286|language=en}}{{self-published source|date=February 2020}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}}<ref>{{cite video|people=Blakely, Johanna|title=Lessons from Fashion's Free Culture (TEDxUSC 2010)|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/johanna_blakley_lessons_from_fashion_s_free_culture.html|publisher=[[TED (conference)|TEDTalks]]|accessdate=December 3, 2010|date=April 2010}}</ref> Slightly contrary to this often-used quote is the fact that rare 1942 recordings exist, that have Parker practicing along with [[Benny Goodman]] records and the fact that he made dozens of records with [[Buddy Rich]] on drums.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Bebop===\n[[File:Charlie Parker, Tommy Potter, Miles Davis, Duke Jordan, Max Roach (Gottlieb 06851).jpg|thumb|right|Parker with (from left to right) [[Tommy Potter]], [[Max Roach]], [[Miles Davis]], and [[Duke Jordan]], at the Three Deuces, New York, circa 1945]]\n\nAccording to an interview Parker gave in the 1950s, one night in 1939 he was playing \"[[Cherokee (Ray Noble song)|Cherokee]]\" in a jam session with guitarist William \"Biddy\" Fleet when he hit upon a method for developing his solos that enabled one of his main musical innovations. He realized that the 12 semitones of the [[chromatic scale]] can lead melodically to any key, breaking some of the confines of simpler jazz soloing.\n\nThere are three basic bebop scales used by Charlie Parker. The Mixolydian (dominant seventh) bebop scale can be used primarily against dominant seventh chords. The Dorian bebop scale is used primarily against minor seventh chords. The Major bebop scale is used primarily against major sixth and major seventh chords. Each of these\nbebop scales is an eight-note scale rather than the typical seven-note scale.\nCharlie Parker was a primary influence on the approaches of guitarist [[Grant Green]].\n\nEarly in its development, this new type of jazz was rejected by many of the established, traditional jazz musicians who disdained their younger counterparts. The beboppers responded by calling these traditionalists \"[[moldy figs]]\". However, some musicians, such as [[Coleman Hawkins]] and Tatum, were more positive about its development, and participated in jam sessions and recording dates in the new approach with its adherents.\n\nBecause of the two-year [[American Federation of Musicians|Musicians' Union]] [[1942\u201344 musicians' strike|ban of all commercial recordings]] from 1942 to 1944, much of bebop's early development was not captured for posterity. As a result, it gained limited radio exposure. Bebop musicians had a difficult time gaining widespread recognition. It was not until 1945, when the recording ban was lifted, that Parker's collaborations with [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Max Roach]], [[Bud Powell]] and others had a substantial effect on the jazz world. (One of their first small-group performances together was rediscovered and issued in 2005: a concert in New York's [[The Town Hall (New York City)|Town Hall]] on June 22, 1945.) Bebop soon gained wider appeal among musicians and fans alike.\n\nOn November 26, 1945, Parker led a record date for the [[Savoy Records|Savoy]] label, marketed as the \"greatest Jazz session ever.\" Recording as Charlie Parker's Reboppers, Parker enlisted such sidemen as Gillespie and [[Miles Davis]] on trumpet, [[Curley Russell]] on bass and [[Max Roach]] on drums. The tracks recorded during this session include \"[[Ko-Ko]]\", \"[[Billie's Bounce]]\" and \"[[Now's the Time (composition)|Now's the Time]]\".\n\nIn December 1945, the Parker/Gillespie band traveled to an unsuccessful engagement at [[Billy Berg's]] club in Los Angeles. Most of the group returned to New York, but Parker remained in California, cashing in his return ticket to buy heroin. He experienced great hardship in California, eventually being committed to [[Camarillo State Mental Hospital]] for a six-month period.\n\nWhen Parker received his discharge from the hospital, he was clean and healthy. Before leaving California, he recorded \"[[Relaxin' at Camarillo]]\" in reference to his hospital stay. He returned to New York, resumed his addiction to heroin and recorded dozens of sides for the [[Savoy Records|Savoy]] and Dial labels, which remain some of the high points of his recorded output. Many of these were with his so-called \"classic quintet\" including Davis and Roach.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Spirit of Creativity: Basic Mechanisms of Creative Achievements|last=Guntern|first=Gottlieb|publisher=University Press of America|year=2010|isbn=9780761850519|location=Lanham, MD|page=245|quote=In the late 1940s, Charlie Parker\u2019s classic quintet\u2014including trumpeter Miles Davis, drummer Max Roach, bass player Tommy Potter, and pianist Bud Powell\u2014produced a series of masterpieces that reached the top of the rating scales.|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1952 Parker and Gillespie released an album entitled \"Bird and Diz\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/bird-and-diz-mw0000188496|title=Bird and Diz - Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie - Songs, Reviews, Credits - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}</ref>\n\n===''Charlie Parker with Strings''===\nA longstanding desire of Parker's was to perform with a [[string instruments|string section]]. He was a keen student of classical music, and contemporaries reported he was most interested in the music and formal innovations of [[Igor Stravinsky]] and longed to engage in a project akin to what later became known as [[Third Stream]], a new kind of music, incorporating both jazz and classical elements as opposed to merely incorporating a string section into performance of jazz standards. On November 30, 1949, [[Norman Granz]] arranged for Parker to record an album of ballads with a mixed group of jazz and [[Orchestra|chamber orchestra]] musicians.{{sfn|Russell|1973|p=273}} Six master takes from this session became the album ''[[Charlie Parker with Strings]]'': \"[[Just Friends (1931 song)|Just Friends]]\", \"[[Everything Happens to Me (song)|Everything Happens to Me]]\", \"[[April in Paris (song)|April in Paris]]\", \"[[Summertime (George Gershwin song)|Summertime]]\", \"[[I Didn't Know What Time It Was]]\", and \"[[If I Should Lose You]]\".\n\n===''Jazz at Massey Hall''===\nIn 1953, Parker performed at [[Massey Hall]] in Toronto, joined by Gillespie, Mingus, Powell and Roach.<ref name=\"Penguin9\">{{cite book |last1=Cook |first1=Richard |authorlink=Richard Cook (journalist) |last2=Morton |first2=Brian |authorlink2=Brian Morton (Scottish writer) |title=The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings |year=2008 |edition=9th |publisher=[[Penguin Books|Penguin]] |isbn=978-0-141-03401-0 |page=1119 |ref=harv|title-link=The Penguin Guide to Jazz }}</ref> Unfortunately, the concert happened at the same time as a televised heavyweight boxing match between [[Rocky Marciano]] and [[Jersey Joe Walcott]], so the musical event was poorly attended.{{sfn|Haddix|2013|pp=149\u2013152}} Mingus recorded the concert, resulting in the album ''[[Jazz at Massey Hall]]''.{{sfn|Haddix|2013|pp=149\u2013152}} At this concert, Parker played a plastic [[Grafton saxophone]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Fordham |first=John |date=October 23, 2009 |title=50 Great Moments in Jazz: The Quintet \u2013 Jazz at Massey Hall |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2009/oct/23/quintet-jazz-at-massey-hall |work=The Guardian |location= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n===Problems===\nParker's life was riddled with mental health problems and heroin addiction.{{sfn|Haddix|2013|pp=2\u20133}} This addiction caused him to miss performances and be considered unreliable.{{sfn|Haddix|2013|pp=2\u20133}} Heroin use was prevalent in the jazz scene, and users could normally acquire it with little difficulty.{{sfn|Haddix|2013|pp=117, 139\u2013140}}\n\nAlthough he produced many brilliant recordings during this period, Parker's behavior became increasingly erratic. Heroin was difficult to obtain once he moved to California, where the drug was less abundant, so he used alcohol as a substitute. A recording for the [[Dial Records (1946)|Dial]] label from July 29, 1946, provides evidence of his condition. Before this session, Parker drank a quart of whiskey. According to the liner notes of ''[[Charlie Parker on Dial#Volume 1|Charlie Parker on Dial Volume 1]]'', Parker missed most of the first two bars of his first chorus on the track, \"Max Making Wax\". When he finally did come in, he swayed wildly and once spun all the way around, away from his microphone. On the next tune, \"[[Lover Man (Oh, Where Can You Be?)|Lover Man]]\", producer [[Ross Russell (jazz)|Ross Russell]] physically supported Parker. On \"Bebop\" (the final track Parker recorded that evening) he begins a solo with a solid first eight bars; on his second eight bars, however, he begins to struggle, and a desperate [[Howard McGhee]], the trumpeter on this session, shouts, \"Blow!\" at him. [[Charles Mingus]] considered this version of \"Lover Man\" to be among Parker's greatest recordings, despite its flaws.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Masters of Bebop: A Listener's Guide|last=Gitler|first=Ira|authorlink=Ira Gitler|year=2001|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=0-306-81009-3|page=[https://archive.org/details/mastersofbebopli00gitl/page/33 33]|quote=Charles Mingus once chose it when asked to name his favorite Parker recordings.

Examples include \"[[Ornithology (composition)|Ornithology]]\" (which borrows the chord progression of jazz standard \"[[How High the Moon]]\" and is said to be co-written with trumpet player Little Benny Harris), and \"Moose The Mooche\" (one of many Parker compositions based on the chord progression of \"I Got Rhythm\").  The practice was not uncommon prior to bebop, but it became a signature of the movement as artists began to move away from arranging popular standards and toward composing their own material.\n\nWhile tunes such as \"Now's The Time\", \"Billie's Bounce\", \"[[Au Privave]]\", [[Barbados (composition)|\"Barbados\"]], \"Relaxin' at Camarillo\", \"[[Bloomdido]]\", and \"Cool Blues\" were based on conventional [[12-bar blues]] changes, Parker also created a unique version of the 12-bar blues for tunes such as \"[[Blues for Alice]]\", \"Laird Baird\", and \"Si Si.\" These unique chords are known popularly as \"[[Bird Changes]]\". Like his solos, some of his compositions are characterized by long, complex melodic lines and a minimum of repetition although he did employ the use of repetition in some tunes, most notably \"Now's The Time\".\n\nParker contributed greatly to the modern jazz solo, one in which [[Tuplet|triplets]] and [[Anacrusis#Music|pick-up notes]] were used in unorthodox ways to lead into chord tones, affording the soloist with more freedom to use [[passing tone]]s, which soloists previously avoided. Parker was admired for his unique style of phrasing and innovative use of rhythm. Via his recordings and the popularity of the posthumously published ''[[Charlie Parker Omnibook]]'', Parker's identifiable style dominated jazz for many years to come.\n\nOther well-known Parker compositions include \"[[Ah-Leu-Cha]]\", [[Anthropology (composition)|\"Anthropology\"]], co-written with Gillespie, [[Confirmation (composition)|\"Confirmation\"]], [[Constellation (composition)|\"Constellation\"]], \"[[Donna Lee]]\", \"[[Moose the Mooche]]\", \"[[Scrapple from the Apple]]\" and \"[[Yardbird Suite]]\", the vocal version of which is called \"What Price Love\", with lyrics by Parker.\n\n[[Miles Davis]] once said, \"You can tell the history of jazz in four words: [[Louis Armstrong]].

He was the only child of Charles Parker and Adelaide \"Addie\" Bailey, who was of mixed [[Choctaw]] and African American background.{{sfn|Haddix|2013}} He attended [[Lincoln College Preparatory Academy|Lincoln High School]]{{sfn|Woideck|1998|p=4}} in September 1934, but withdrew in December 1935, just before joining the local musicians' union and to pursue his musical career full-time.{{sfn|Haddix|2013|p=19}} His childhood sweetheart and future wife, Rebecca Ruffin, graduated from Lincoln High School in June 1935.\n\nParker began playing the saxophone at age 11, and at age 14 he joined his high school band where he studied under Bandmaster Alonzo Lewis. His mother purchased a new alto saxophone around the same time. His father, Charles Sr., was often required to travel for work, but provided some musical influence because he was a pianist, dancer and singer on the [[Theater Owners Booking Association]] (T.O.B.A.) circuit. He later became a [[Pullman Company|Pullman]] waiter or chef on the railways. Parker's mother Addie worked nights at the local [[Western Union]] office.{{sfn|Giddins|2013|pp=21\u201323}} His biggest influence at that time was a young [[trombone]] player named Robert Simpson, who taught him the basics of improvisation.{{sfn|Woideck|1998|p=8}}\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Bird's sax NMAAHC-2019.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Alto sax owned and used by Charlie Parker, now at the [[Smithsonian Institution]]]]\n===Early career===\nIn the mid-1930s, Parker began to practice diligently. During this period he mastered improvisation and developed some of the ideas that led to the later development of [[Bebop]]. In an interview with [[Paul Desmond]], Parker said that he spent three to four years practicing up to 15 hours a day.<ref>{{cite web |title=Paul Desmond Interviews Charlie Parker (1954) |url=https://bobreynoldsmusic.com/paul-desmond-charlie-parker/ |website=Bob Reynolds |accessdate=11 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.puredesmond.ca/pdbird.htm |website=Puredesmond.ca |accessdate=March 1, 2011 |title=Paul Desmond interviews Charlie Parker |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706194036/http://www.puredesmond.ca/pdbird.htm |archivedate=July 6, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nBands led by [[Count Basie]] and [[Bennie Moten]] certainly influenced Parker. He played with local bands in jazz clubs around Kansas City, Missouri, where he perfected his technique, with the assistance of [[Buster Smith]], whose dynamic transitions to double and triple time influenced Parker's developing style.\n\nIn late spring 1936, Parker played at a jam session at the Reno Club in Kansas City. His attempt to improvise failed when he lost track of the chord changes. This prompted [[Jo Jones]], the drummer for Count Basie's Orchestra, to contemptuously throw a cymbal at his feet as a signal to leave the stage.{{sfn|Haddix|2013|p=21}} However, rather than discouraging Parker, the incident caused him to vow to practice harder, and turned out to be a seminal moment in the young musician's career when he returned as a new man a year later.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/17/charlie-parker-cymbal-thrown|title=A teenage Charlie Parker has a cymbal thrown at him|first=John|last=Fordham|date=June 16, 2011|website=the Guardian}}</ref> Parker proposed to his wife, Rebecca Ruffin, the same year and the two were married on July 25, 1936.<ref>Anita Dixon, \"Charlie Parker, 'I was his first, he was my first, it was all special,\" Pitch Weekly (KCMO), April 10, 1996</ref> In the fall of 1936, Parker traveled with a band from Kansas City to the Ozarks for the opening of Clarence Musser's Tavern south of Eldon, Missouri. Along the way, the caravan of musicians had a car accident and Parker broke three ribs and fractured his spine.{{sfn|Haddix|2013|p=24}} The accident led to Parker's ultimate troubles with pain killers and opioids, especially heroin. Parker struggled with drug use for the rest of his life.\n\nDespite his near death experience on the way to the Ozarks in 1936, Parker returned to the area in 1937 where he spent some serious time [[woodshedding]] and developing his sound.{{sfn|Haddix|2013}}{{sfn|Crouch|2013}} In 1938 Parker joined pianist [[Jay McShann]]'s [[territory band]].{{sfn|Woideck|1998|p=18}} The band toured nightclubs and other venues of the southwest, as well as Chicago and New York City.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/jazz/biography/artist_id_parker_charlie.htm |title=pbs.org |publisher=pbs.org |accessdate=March 10, 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://amb.cult.bg/music/jazz/mp3/notes/CHARLI.htm amb.cult.bg] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221093817/http://amb.cult.bg/music/jazz/mp3/notes/CHARLI.htm |date=December 21, 2007 }}</ref> Parker made his professional recording debut with McShann's band.\n\n===New York City===\nIn 1939 Parker moved to New York City, to pursue a career in music. He held several other jobs as well. He worked for nine dollars a week as a dishwasher at Jimmie's Chicken Shack, where pianist [[Art Tatum]] performed.<ref>See ''[[Jazz (TV series)|Jazz]]'', Episode 7: \"Dedicated to Chaos: 1940\u20131945\".</ref>  It was in 1939 in New York that Parker had his musical breakthrough that had begun in 1937 in the Missouri Ozarks. Playing through the changes on the song \"Cherokee\", Parker discovered a new musical vocabulary and sound that forever shifted the course of music history.\n\nIn 1940, he returned to Kansas City to perform with Jay McShann and to attend the funeral of his father, Charles, Sr. He played Fairyland Park in the summer with McShann's band at 75th and Prospect for all-white audiences. The up-side of the summer was his introduction to Dizzy Gillespie by Step Buddy Anderson near 19th and Vine in the summer of 1940.{{sfn|Haddix|2013}}{{sfn|Crouch|2013}} After the summer season at Fairyland, Parker left with McShann's band for gigs in the region. On a trip to Omaha he earned his nickname from McShann and the band after an incident with a chicken and the tour bus.\n\nIn 1942 Parker left McShann's band and played for one year with [[Earl Hines]], whose band included [[Dizzy Gillespie]], who later played with Parker as a duo. This period is virtually undocumented, due to [[1942\u201344 musicians' strike|the strike of 1942\u20131943]] by the [[American Federation of Musicians]], during which time few professional recordings were made. Parker joined a group of young musicians, and played in after-hours clubs in Harlem, such as [[Clark Monroe's Uptown House]]. These young iconoclasts included Gillespie, pianist [[Thelonious Monk]], guitarist [[Charlie Christian]], and drummer [[Kenny Clarke]]. The beboppers' attitude was summed up in a famous quotation attributed to Monk by [[Mary Lou Williams]]: \"We wanted a music that they couldn't play\" (the \"they\" here are white bandleaders, who had taken over swing music, and made money from it.)<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=byShDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT467&lpg=PT467 |title=The History of Jazz and the Jazz Musicians|last=Nicholas|first=Aurwin|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781365838286|language=en}}{{self-published source|date=February 2020}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}}<ref>{{cite video|people=Blakely, Johanna|title=Lessons from Fashion's Free Culture (TEDxUSC 2010)|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/johanna_blakley_lessons_from_fashion_s_free_culture.html|publisher=[[TED (conference)|TEDTalks]]|accessdate=December 3, 2010|date=April 2010}}</ref> Slightly contrary to this often-used quote is the fact that rare 1942 recordings exist, that have Parker practicing along with [[Benny Goodman]] records and the fact that he made dozens of records with [[Buddy Rich]] on drums.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Bebop===\n[[File:Charlie Parker, Tommy Potter, Miles Davis, Duke Jordan, Max Roach (Gottlieb 06851).jpg|thumb|right|Parker with (from left to right) [[Tommy Potter]], [[Max Roach]], [[Miles Davis]], and [[Duke Jordan]], at the Three Deuces, New York, circa 1945]]\n\nAccording to an interview Parker gave in the 1950s, one night in 1939 he was playing \"[[Cherokee (Ray Noble song)|Cherokee]]\" in a jam session with guitarist William \"Biddy\" Fleet when he hit upon a method for developing his solos that enabled one of his main musical innovations. He realized that the 12 semitones of the [[chromatic scale]] can lead melodically to any key, breaking some of the confines of simpler jazz soloing.\n\nThere are three basic bebop scales used by Charlie Parker. The Mixolydian (dominant seventh) bebop scale can be used primarily against dominant seventh chords. The Dorian bebop scale is used primarily against minor seventh chords. The Major bebop scale is used primarily against major sixth and major seventh chords. Each of these\nbebop scales is an eight-note scale rather than the typical seven-note scale.\nCharlie Parker was a primary influence on the approaches of guitarist [[Grant Green]].\n\nEarly in its development, this new type of jazz was rejected by many of the established, traditional jazz musicians who disdained their younger counterparts. The beboppers responded by calling these traditionalists \"[[moldy figs]]\". However, some musicians, such as [[Coleman Hawkins]] and Tatum, were more positive about its development, and participated in jam sessions and recording dates in the new approach with its adherents.\n\nBecause of the two-year [[American Federation of Musicians|Musicians' Union]] [[1942\u201344 musicians' strike|ban of all commercial recordings]] from 1942 to 1944, much of bebop's early development was not captured for posterity. As a result, it gained limited radio exposure. Bebop musicians had a difficult time gaining widespread recognition. It was not until 1945, when the recording ban was lifted, that Parker's collaborations with [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Max Roach]], [[Bud Powell]] and others had a substantial effect on the jazz world. (One of their first small-group performances together was rediscovered and issued in 2005: a concert in New York's [[The Town Hall (New York City)|Town Hall]] on June 22, 1945.) Bebop soon gained wider appeal among musicians and fans alike.\n\nOn November 26, 1945, Parker led a record date for the [[Savoy Records|Savoy]] label, marketed as the \"greatest Jazz session ever.\" Recording as Charlie Parker's Reboppers, Parker enlisted such sidemen as Gillespie and [[Miles Davis]] on trumpet, [[Curley Russell]] on bass and [[Max Roach]] on drums. The tracks recorded during this session include \"[[Ko-Ko]]\", \"[[Billie's Bounce]]\" and \"[[Now's the Time (composition)|Now's the Time]]\".\n\nIn December 1945, the Parker/Gillespie band traveled to an unsuccessful engagement at [[Billy Berg's]] club in Los Angeles. Most of the group returned to New York, but Parker remained in California, cashing in his return ticket to buy heroin. He experienced great hardship in California, eventually being committed to [[Camarillo State Mental Hospital]] for a six-month period.\n\nWhen Parker received his discharge from the hospital, he was clean and healthy. Before leaving California, he recorded \"[[Relaxin' at Camarillo]]\" in reference to his hospital stay. He returned to New York, resumed his addiction to heroin and recorded dozens of sides for the [[Savoy Records|Savoy]] and Dial labels, which remain some of the high points of his recorded output. Many of these were with his so-called \"classic quintet\" including Davis and Roach.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Spirit of Creativity: Basic Mechanisms of Creative Achievements|last=Guntern|first=Gottlieb|publisher=University Press of America|year=2010|isbn=9780761850519|location=Lanham, MD|page=245|quote=In the late 1940s, Charlie Parker\u2019s classic quintet\u2014including trumpeter Miles Davis, drummer Max Roach, bass player Tommy Potter, and pianist Bud Powell\u2014produced a series of masterpieces that reached the top of the rating scales.|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1952 Parker and Gillespie released an album entitled \"Bird and Diz\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/bird-and-diz-mw0000188496|title=Bird and Diz - Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie - Songs, Reviews, Credits - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}</ref>\n\n===''Charlie Parker with Strings''===\nA longstanding desire of Parker's was to perform with a [[string instruments|string section]]. He was a keen student of classical music, and contemporaries reported he was most interested in the music and formal innovations of [[Igor Stravinsky]] and longed to engage in a project akin to what later became known as [[Third Stream]], a new kind of music, incorporating both jazz and classical elements as opposed to merely incorporating a string section into performance of jazz standards. On November 30, 1949, [[Norman Granz]] arranged for Parker to record an album of ballads with a mixed group of jazz and [[Orchestra|chamber orchestra]] musicians.{{sfn|Russell|1973|p=273}} Six master takes from this session became the album ''[[Charlie Parker with Strings]]'': \"[[Just Friends (1931 song)|Just Friends]]\", \"[[Everything Happens to Me (song)|Everything Happens to Me]]\", \"[[April in Paris (song)|April in Paris]]\", \"[[Summertime (George Gershwin song)|Summertime]]\", \"[[I Didn't Know What Time It Was]]\", and \"[[If I Should Lose You]]\".\n\n===''Jazz at Massey Hall''===\nIn 1953, Parker performed at [[Massey Hall]] in Toronto, joined by Gillespie, Mingus, Powell and Roach.<ref name=\"Penguin9\">{{cite book |last1=Cook |first1=Richard |authorlink=Richard Cook (journalist) |last2=Morton |first2=Brian |authorlink2=Brian Morton (Scottish writer) |title=The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings |year=2008 |edition=9th |publisher=[[Penguin Books|Penguin]] |isbn=978-0-141-03401-0 |page=1119 |ref=harv|title-link=The Penguin Guide to Jazz }}</ref> Unfortunately, the concert happened at the same time as a televised heavyweight boxing match between [[Rocky Marciano]] and [[Jersey Joe Walcott]], so the musical event was poorly attended.{{sfn|Haddix|2013|pp=149\u2013152}} Mingus recorded the concert, resulting in the album ''[[Jazz at Massey Hall]]''.{{sfn|Haddix|2013|pp=149\u2013152}} At this concert, Parker played a plastic [[Grafton saxophone]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Fordham |first=John |date=October 23, 2009 |title=50 Great Moments in Jazz: The Quintet \u2013 Jazz at Massey Hall |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2009/oct/23/quintet-jazz-at-massey-hall |work=The Guardian |location= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n===Problems===\nParker's life was riddled with mental health problems and heroin addiction.{{sfn|Haddix|2013|pp=2\u20133}} This addiction caused him to miss performances and be considered unreliable.{{sfn|Haddix|2013|pp=2\u20133}} Heroin use was prevalent in the jazz scene, and users could normally acquire it with little difficulty.{{sfn|Haddix|2013|pp=117, 139\u2013140}}\n\nAlthough he produced many brilliant recordings during this period, Parker's behavior became increasingly erratic. Heroin was difficult to obtain once he moved to California, where the drug was less abundant, so he used alcohol as a substitute. A recording for the [[Dial Records (1946)|Dial]] label from July 29, 1946, provides evidence of his condition. Before this session, Parker drank a quart of whiskey. According to the liner notes of ''[[Charlie Parker on Dial#Volume 1|Charlie Parker on Dial Volume 1]]'', Parker missed most of the first two bars of his first chorus on the track, \"Max Making Wax\". When he finally did come in, he swayed wildly and once spun all the way around, away from his microphone. On the next tune, \"[[Lover Man (Oh, Where Can You Be?)|Lover Man]]\", producer [[Ross Russell (jazz)|Ross Russell]] physically supported Parker. On \"Bebop\" (the final track Parker recorded that evening) he begins a solo with a solid first eight bars; on his second eight bars, however, he begins to struggle, and a desperate [[Howard McGhee]], the trumpeter on this session, shouts, \"Blow!\" at him.

The official causes of death were [[lobar pneumonia]] and a [[perforated ulcer|bleeding ulcer]], but Parker also had an advanced case of [[cirrhosis]] and had suffered a heart attack.

His marital status complicated the settling of Parker's estate and would ultimately serve to frustrate his wish to be quietly interred in New York City.\n\n[[Dizzy Gillespie]] paid for the funeral arrangements<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/jazz/about/pdfs/Parker.pdf |title=Ken Burns interviews Chan Parker|website=Pbs.org |accessdate=March 10, 2011}}</ref> and organized a lying-in-state, a Harlem procession officiated by Congressman and Reverend [[Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.]], as well as a memorial concert.

Examples include \"[[Ornithology (composition)|Ornithology]]\" (which borrows the chord progression of jazz standard \"[[How High the Moon]]\" and is said to be co-written with trumpet player Little Benny Harris), and \"Moose The Mooche\" (one of many Parker compositions based on the chord progression of \"I Got Rhythm\").  The practice was not uncommon prior to bebop, but it became a signature of the movement as artists began to move away from arranging popular standards and toward composing their own material.\n\nWhile tunes such as \"Now's The Time\", \"Billie's Bounce\", \"[[Au Privave]]\", [[Barbados (composition)|\"Barbados\"]], \"Relaxin' at Camarillo\", \"[[Bloomdido]]\", and \"Cool Blues\" were based on conventional [[12-bar blues]] changes, Parker also created a unique version of the 12-bar blues for tunes such as \"[[Blues for Alice]]\", \"Laird Baird\", and \"Si Si.\" These unique chords are known popularly as \"[[Bird Changes]]\". Like his solos, some of his compositions are characterized by long, complex melodic lines and a minimum of repetition although he did employ the use of repetition in some tunes, most notably \"Now's The Time\".\n\nParker contributed greatly to the modern jazz solo, one in which [[Tuplet|triplets]] and [[Anacrusis#Music|pick-up notes]] were used in unorthodox ways to lead into chord tones, affording the soloist with more freedom to use [[passing tone]]s, which soloists previously avoided. Parker was admired for his unique style of phrasing and innovative use of rhythm. Via his recordings and the popularity of the posthumously published ''[[Charlie Parker Omnibook]]'', Parker's identifiable style dominated jazz for many years to come.\n\nOther well-known Parker compositions include \"[[Ah-Leu-Cha]]\", [[Anthropology (composition)|\"Anthropology\"]], co-written with Gillespie, [[Confirmation (composition)|\"Confirmation\"]], [[Constellation (composition)|\"Constellation\"]], \"[[Donna Lee]]\", \"[[Moose the Mooche]]\", \"[[Scrapple from the Apple]]\" and \"[[Yardbird Suite]]\", the vocal version of which is called \"What Price Love\", with lyrics by Parker.\n\n[[Miles Davis]] once said, \"You can tell the history of jazz in four words: [[Louis Armstrong]].
