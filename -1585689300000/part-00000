100 000 adults annually.<ref name=Fortes2017/><ref name=GrimesBook2014/><ref name=ColtonBook2011/><ref name=IARC/> The incidence of laryngeal papillomatosis in children peaks before the age of 5, though the term juvenile papillomatosis refers to all cases occurring before the age of 20.<ref name=IARC/><ref name=Fortes2017/> The incidence of adult laryngeal papillomatosis, which has an onset after the age of 20, peaks between the ages of 20 and 40.<ref name=Fortes2017/><ref name=IARC/> While there are no gender differences in the incidence of laryngeal papillomatosis in children, adult laryngeal papillomatosis occurs more frequently in males than in females.<ref name=Fortes2017/><ref name=WenigBook2013/><ref name=IARC/> The incidence of laryngeal papillomatosis also varies according to factors such as socioeconomic status, such that higher rates are observed in groups having a lower socioeconomic status.<ref name=Fortes2017/>\n\n==Costs==\nBecause of its relative commonness and the cost of treatments, more money is spent on treating RRP than any other benign airway tumor.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Research==\nAs of 2015 use of the [[MMR vaccine|measles-mumps-rubella vaccine]]

As with those of other States, the Declaration was not recognized by the United States government at Washington. Some Texan military units fought in the [[American Civil War#Confederate states|Civil War]] east of the [[Mississippi River]], but Texas was most useful for supplying soldiers and horses for [[Confederate States Army|Confederate forces]]. Texas' supply role lasted until mid-1863, after which time Union gunboats controlled the Mississippi River, making large transfers of men, horses or cattle impossible. Some cotton was sold in [[French intervention in Mexico|Mexico]], but most of the crop became useless because of the Union naval blockade of [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]], [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], and other ports.\n\n==Secession==\nIn the early winter of 1860, Texan counties sent delegates to a special convention to debate the merits of secession.

By February 1861, the other six states of the sub-region had separately passed ordinances of secession. However, events in Texas were delayed, largely due to the resistance of [[Southern Unionist]] governor, [[Sam Houston]]. Unlike the other \"cotton states\"' chief executives, who took the initiative in secessionist efforts, Houston refused to call the [[Texas Legislature]] into special session to consider the question, relenting only when it became apparent citizens were prepared to act without him.\n\nIn early December 1860, before South Carolina even seceded, a group of State officials published via newspaper a call for a statewide election of convention delegates on January 8, 1861. This election was highly irregular, even for the standards of the day. It often relied on voice vote at public meetings, although \"[[Voice vote|viva voce]]\" (voice) voting for popular elections had been used since at least March 1846, less than three months after statehood.<ref>An Act to direct the mode of voting in all popular elections, approved March 19, 1846. {{cite book|title=The Laws of Texas, 1822-1897|volume=2|editor-first=H.P.N.|editor-last=Gammel|editorlink=Hans Peter Mareus Neilsen Gammel|year=1898|page=1318|publisher=[[University of North Texas]]|url=http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth6726/m1/1322/|ref={{harvid|Gammel|1898b}}}}</ref> Unionists were often discouraged from attending or chose not to participate. This resulted in lopsided representation of secessionists delegates.<ref name=\"Secession Convention\"/>\n\nThe election call had stipulated for the delegates to assemble in convention on January 28. Houston called the Legislature into session, hoping that the elected body would declare the unauthorized convention illegal.<ref name=\"Secession Convention\"/> Though he expressed reservations about the election of Abraham Lincoln, he urged the State of Texas to reject secession, citing the horrors of war and a probable defeat of the South. The convention removed Houston from the governorship, then promoted the Lieutenant Governor, Edward Clark.<ref>{{cite web|title=Houston, Sam|author=Thomas H.

The following day, convention president Oran Roberts introduced a resolution suggesting Texas leave the Union.\nThe ordinance was read on the floor the next day, citing the failures of the federal government to protect the lives and property of Texas citizens and accusing the Northern states of using the same as a weapon to \"strike down the interests and prosperity\"<ref name=\"Ordinance of Secession\" /> of the Southern people.\n  \nAfter the grievances were listed, the ordinance repealed the one of July 4, 1845, in which Texas approved annexation by the [[United States]] and the [[Constitution of the United States]], and revoked all powers of, obligations to, and allegiance to, the U.S. federal government and the U.S. Constitution.<ref name=\"Ordinance of Secession\" />\n\nIn the interests of historical significance and posterity, the ordinance was written to take effect on March 2, the date of [[Texas Declaration of Independence]] (and, coincidentally, Houston's birthday).\n\nOn February 1, members of the Legislature, and a huge crowd of private citizens, packed the House galleries and balcony to watch the final vote on the question of secession. Seventy \"yea\" votes were recorded before there was a single \"nay.\" One of the negative votes is enshrined in Texas history books. [[James W. Throckmorton|James Webb Throckmorton]], from Collin County in North Texas, in response to the roar of hisses and boos and catcalls which greeted his decision, retorted, \"When the rabble hiss, well may patriots tremble.\" Appreciating his style, the crowd afforded him a grudging round of applause (like many Texans who initially opposed secession, Throckmorton accepted the result and served his state, rising to the rank of brigadier-general in the Confederate army).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Minor |first=David |title=Throckmorton, James Webb |work=Handbook of Texas Online |publisher=Texas State Historical Association |url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fth36 |date=November 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe final tally for secession was 166\u20137{{cn span|, a vote whose legality was upheld by the Texas Legislature on February 7|date=January 2016}}.

On March 4, the convention assembled again to formally declare Texas out of the Union and to approve the \"Constitution of the Confederate States of America\", which had been drawn up by its \"Provisional Congress\" (as it turned out, Texas had already been admitted into the fold on March 1).\n\nIn March, George Williamson, the Louisianan state commissioner, addressed the Texan secession convention, where he called upon Texas and the slave states of the U.S. to declare secession from the Union in order to continue the institution of slavery:\n\n{{Quotation|With the social balance wheel of slavery to regulate its machinery, we may fondly indulge the hope that our Southern government will be perpetual...

Instead, he urged that Texas revert to its former status as an independent republic and stay neutral. Houston took his seat on March 16, the date state officials were scheduled to take an oath of allegiance to the Confederacy. He remained silent as his name was called out three times and, after failing to respond, the office of governor was declared vacant and Houston was deposed from office.\n\n===Seizure of federal property and arms===\nAfter Texas passed its Ordinance of Secession, the state government appointed four men as \"Commissioners of Public Safety\" to negotiate with the federal government for the safe transfer of military installations and bases in Texas to the Confederates. Along with land baron [[Samuel A. Maverick]] and Thomas J. Devine, Dr. [[Philip N. Luckett]] met with [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] General [[David E. Twiggs]] on February 8, 1861, to arrange the surrender of the federal property in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], including the military stores being housed in the old [[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|Alamo mission]].\n\nAs a result of the negotiations, Twiggs delivered his entire command and its associated Army property (10,000 rifled muskets) to the Confederacy, an act that brought cries of treason from Unionists throughout the state.<ref>{{cite book |last=Roberts |first=O.M. |author-link=Oran Milo Roberts |title=Texas |editor-link=Clement A.

The referendum on the issue indicated that some 25% favored remaining in the Union at the time the question was originally considered.\n\nThe largest concentration of anti-secession sentiment was among the [[German Texan]] population in the [[Texas Hill Country]], and in some of the counties of [[North Texas]]. In the latter region, most of the residents were originally from states of the [[Upper South]].

Young on the orders of Colonel James Bourland, Confederate Provost Marshal for northern Texas. A court was convened in Gainesville to try them for allegedly plotting to seize the arsenals at Sherman and Gainesville and to kill their Confederate neighbors, seize their property, and to cooperate with Union army forces poised to invade northern Texas from Arkansas and/or Indian Territory. Several of the settlers were hanged in what is now downtown Gainesville during the first week of October. Nineteen additional men were found guilty and hanged before the end of the month. A total of about forty Unionists were [[Great Hanging at Gainesville|hanged in Gainesville]], two were shot while trying to escape, and two more were hanged elsewhere after being turned over to a military tribunal. Under the primitive conditions on the Texas frontier during the Civil War, evidence against the accused was questionable, and the legal proceedings were highly imperfect. A granite monument in a small park marks the spot where the hangings took place.<ref name=\"Great Hanging\"/>\n\nThe Confederacy's conscription act proved controversial, not only in Texas but all across the South.

While he argued for slave property rights and deplored the election of the Lincoln Administration, he considered secession unconstitutional and thought secession at that moment in time was a \"rash action\" that was certain to lead to a conflict favoring the industrial and populated North. He predicted: \"Let me tell you what is coming. After the sacrifice of countless millions of treasure and hundreds of thousands of lives, you may win Southern independence if God be not against you, but I doubt it. I tell you that, while I believe with you in the doctrine of states rights, the North is determined to preserve this Union.

The state furnished the Confederacy with 45 regiments of cavalry, 23 regiments of infantry, 12 battalions of cavalry, 4 battalions of infantry, 5 regiments of heavy artillery, and 30 batteries of light artillery. The state maintained at its own expense some additional troops that were for home defense. These included 5 regiments and 4 battalions of cavalry, and 4 regiments and one battalion of infantry. In 1862 the [[Confederate Congress]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]], passed a [[conscription|conscription law]] that ordered all men from 18 to 45 years of age to be placed into military service except ministers, state, city, county officers, and certain slave owners; all persons holding 20 slaves or more were exempt from Confederate conscription under the \"[[Twenty Negro Law]]\".<ref>{{Cite book|authorlink=James W.

Often serving as \"shock troops\" of General [[Robert E. Lee]]'s [[Army of Northern Virginia]], the Texas Brigade was \"always favorites\" of General Lee and on more than one occasion Lee praised their fighting qualities, remarking that none had brought greater honor to their native state than \"my Texans.\" Hood's men suffered severe casualties in a number of fights, most notably at the [[Battle of Antietam]], where they faced off with Wisconsin's [[Iron Brigade]], and at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]], where they assaulted Houck's Ridge and then [[Little Round Top]].\n\n\"[[Walker's Greyhounds|Walker's Greyhound Division]]\" was a [[division (military)|division]] composed of four brigades with Texan units; the only division in the [[Confederate States Army]] that maintained its single-state composition throughout the War. Formed in 1862 under command of Major General [[John George Walker]] it fought in the Western Theater and the Trans-Mississippi Department, and was considered an elite backbone of the army. Detached from the division in 1863, the 4th brigade fought at the [[Battle of Arkansas Post]], where it became isolated and was forced to surrender. A new fourth brigade was added the division in 1865.\n\nAmong the most famous mounted units were [[Terry's Texas Rangers]], a militia of former rangers and frontiersmen, many of whom later became peacekeepers in the Old West; and the 33rd Texas Cavalry Regiment of Colonel [[Santos Benavides]], which guarded the Confederate cotton trade lines from Texas into northern Mexico.\n\nOver 2,000 Texas men joined the [[Union Army]]. Notable among them was future Texas governor [[Edmund J. Davis]] who initially commanded the Union Army's [[1st Texas Cavalry Regiment (Union)|1st Texas Cavalry Regiment]] and rose to the rank of [[brigadier general]].\n\nTexas's relatively large [[German American|German]] population around [[Austin County]] led by [[Paul Machemehl]] tried to remain neutral in the War but eventually left Confederate Texas for Mexico. [[East Texas]] gave the most support to secession, and the only East Texas counties in which significant numbers of people opposed secession were [[Angelina County, Texas|Angelina County]], [[Fannin County, Texas|Fannin County]], and [[Lamar County, Texas|Lamar County]], although these counties supplied many men to Texas regiments, including the 9th Texas Infantry Regiment; the 1st Partisan Rangers; 3rd, 4th, 9th, 27th, and 29th Texas Cavalry; and the 9th Texas Field Battery.\n\nIn 1862, [[Abraham Lincoln]] named a former [[United States Congressman]], [[Andrew J.

During the early stages of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] Hamilton was named as the first provisional civilian governor. For a time thereafter, active-duty U.S. Army officers served as military governors of Texas.\n\nYears into the war, one Confederate soldier from Texas gave his reasons for fighting for the Confederacy, stating that \"we are fighting for our property\", whereas Union soldiers were fighting for the \"flimsy and abstract idea that a negro is equal to an Anglo\".<ref name=JMMcPherson1997p117>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/forcausecomrades00mcph|url-access=registration|title=For Cause and Comrades: Why Men Fought in the Civil War|page=[https://archive.org/details/forcausecomrades00mcph/page/117 117]|last=McPherson|first=James M.|date=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc.|oclc=34912692|location=New York City, New York|authorlink=James M.

However, the Union mounted several attempts to capture the \"[[Trans-Mississippi]]\" regions of Texas and [[Louisiana]] from 1862 until the war's end. With ports to the east captured or under blockade, Texas in particular became a [[Texas_in_the_American_Civil_War#Texas_occupation|blockade-running haven]]. \n\n==Texas occupation==\nUnder the [[Anaconda Plan]], the [[Union Navy]] blockaded the principal seaport, [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]] and the entire Gulf and Southern borders, for four years, and federal troops occupied the city for three months in late 1862. Confederate troops under Gen. [[John B. Magruder]] recaptured the city on January 1, 1863 and it remained in Confederate hands until the end of the war. A few days later the Confederate raider [[CSS Alabama|CSS ''Alabama'']] attacked and sank the [[USS Hatteras (1861)|USS ''Hatteras'']] in a naval engagement off the coast of Galveston. \n\n[[File:Scott-anaconda.jpg|thumb|left|Anaconda Plan, Civil War]]\n\n[[Wends_of_Texas#Civil_War-era|Civilian]] [[Blockade#Blockade_running|Blockade Runners]] largely evaded the Union blockades, bandits, and Union-sympathetic Mexicans in order to smuggle cotton out of [[Bagdad,_Tamaulipas|The Port of Bagdad, Mexico]] at a premium in exchange for goods on [[Europe]]an and [[black markets]]<ref>https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/drw01</ref>, as Texas offered an unparalleled and significant opportunity to export Southern cotton out of the Confederacy. [[President Lincoln]] referred to the strategic importance of this economic movement through the [[Rio Grande]] to the [[Edwin Stanton|Secretary of War, Edwin Stanton]] in 1863 stating, \"no local object is now more desirable.\"<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=QxywnKkZSlYC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA130#v=onepage&q&f=false</ref> The Rio Grande Expedition, led by [[Nathaniel P. Banks|General Nathaniel P. Banks]], was then sent forth to secure the ports near [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]] and pushed 100 miles in-land, in order to impede the flow of cotton and deny freedom of movement.\n\nA few other cities also fell to Union troops at times during the war, including [[Port Lavaca, Texas|Port Lavaca]], [[Indianola, Texas|Indianola]], and [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]]. Federal attempts to seize control of [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]], [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]], and [[Sabine Pass]] failed. By the end of the war no territory but [[Brazos Island]] and El Paso was in Union hands.  The [[California Column]] occupied the region around El Paso from 1862 to the end of the war.\n\nThe most notable military battle in Texas during the war happened on September 8, 1863. At the [[Second Battle of Sabine Pass]], a small garrison of 46 Confederates from the mostly-Irish Davis Guards under Lt. [[Richard W. Dowling]], 1st Texas Heavy Artillery, defeated a much larger Union force from [[New Orleans]] under Gen. [[William B. Franklin]]. Skilled gunnery by Dowling's troops disabled the lead ships in Franklin's flotilla, prompting the remainder\u20144,000 men on 27 ships\u2014to retreat back to New Orleans. This victory against such overwhelming odds resulted in the Confederate Congress passing a special resolution of recognition, and the only contemporary military decoration of the South, the [[Davis Guard Medal]].<ref>{{cite web |title=War Medals of the Confederacy: The Davis Guard Medal |website=20-20site.org |url=http://www.2020site.org/medals/davisguard.html |access-date=November 5, 2015}}</ref> CSA President [[Jefferson Davis]] stated, \"Sabine Pass will stand, perhaps for all time, as the greatest military victory in the history of the world.\"\n\nIn 1864, many Texas forces, including a division under [[Camille de Polignac]], a French prince and Confederate general, moved into Northwestern Louisiana to stall Union Maj. Gen. [[Nathaniel Banks]]' [[Red River Campaign]], which was intended to advance into Texas from its eastern border. [[Confederate army|Confederate forces]] halted the expedition at the [[Battle of Mansfield]], just east of the Texas border.\n\nUnion forces from Brazos Island launched the Brazos Santiago Expedition, leading to the last battle of the Civil War, the [[Battle of Palmito Ranch]], fought in Texas on May 12, 1865, well after [[Robert E. Lee]]'s surrender on April 9, 1865, at [[Old Appomattox Court House]], [[Virginia]].\n\n==Collapse of Confederate authority in Texas==\nIn the spring of 1865, Texas contained over 60,000 soldiers of the Army of the [[Trans-Mississippi]] under General [[Edmund Kirby Smith]]. As garrison troops far removed from the main theaters of the war, morale had deteriorated to the point of frequent desertion and thievery. News of the surrender of Lee and other Confederate generals east of the Mississippi finally reached Texas around April 20. Local Confederate authorities had mixed opinions on their future course of action. Most senior military leaders vowed to press on with the war, including commanding general Kirby Smith. Many soldiers, however, greeted frequent speeches whose theme was \"fight on, boys\" with derision, or simply failed to attend them.\n\nThe month of May brought increasing rates of desertion. News of [[Joseph E. Johnston]]'s and [[Richard Taylor (general)|Richard Taylor]]'s surrenders confirmed that Texas, [[Louisiana]], and [[Arkansas]] were now essentially alone to continue the Confederate cause. On May 14, troops in Galveston briefly mutinied, but were persuaded to remain under arms. However, morale continued to sink. Generals [[John B. Magruder]] and Kirby Smith (who had already corresponded with Union Maj. Gen. [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]] regarding surrender terms on May 9) no longer sought to rally their demoralized troops, but rather began discussing the distribution of Confederate government property. Magruder pleaded that the rapid disbanding of the army would prevent depredations by disgruntled soldiers against the civilian population.\n\nThe haste to disband the army, combined with the pressing need to protect Confederate property from Union confiscation, created general mayhem. Soldiers began openly pillaging the Galveston quartermasters stores on May 21. Over the next few days, a mob demanded that a government warehouse be opened to them, and soldiers detained and plundered a train. Several hundred civilians sacked the [[blockade runner]] ''Lark'' when it docked on May 24, and troops sent to pacify the crowd soon joined in the plunder. On May 23, residents in Houston sacked the ordnance building and the clothing bureau. Riots continued in the city until May 26. Both government and private stores were raided extensively in Tyler, Marshall, Huntsville, Gonzales, Hempstead, La Grange, and Brownsville. In Navasota, a powder explosion cost eight lives and flattened twenty buildings. In Austin, the State Treasury was raided and $17,000 in gold was stolen. By May 27, half of the original Confederate forces in Texas had deserted or been disbanded, and formal order had disappeared into lawlessness in many areas of Texas.\n\nThe formal remnants of Kirby Smith's army had finally disintegrated by the end of May. Upon his arrival in Houston from [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]], the general called a court of inquiry to investigate the \"causes and manner of the disbandment of the troops in the District of Texas, New Mexico and Arizona.\" The May 30 findings laid the blame primarily on the civilian population. Kirby Smith addressed his few remaining soldiers and condemned those that had fled for not struggling to the last and leaving him \"a commander without an army\u2013 a General without troops.\" On June 2, he formally surrendered what was left of the Army of the \"Trans-Mississippi\".\n\n==Restoration to the Union==\nFederal troops didn't arrive in Texas to restore order until June 19, 1865, when Union Maj. Gen. [[Gordon Granger]] and 2,000 Union soldiers arrived on [[Galveston Island]] to take possession of the state and enforce the new freedoms of former slaves. The Texas holiday [[Juneteenth]] commemorates this date. The Stars and Stripes were not raised over Austin until June 25.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Breakup: The Collapse of the Confederate Trans-Mississippi Army in Texas, 1865 |first=Brad R. |last=Clampitt |journal=Southwestern Historical Quarterly |publisher=Texas State Historical Association |volume=108 |issue=4 |date=April 2005 |jstor=30240424}}</ref>\n\nPresident [[Andrew Johnson]] appointed Union General [[Andrew J. Hamilton]], a prominent politician before the war, as the provisional governor on June 17. He granted amnesty to ex-Confederates if they promised to support the Union in the future, appointing some to office. On March 30, 1870, the [[United States Congress]] permitted Texas' representatives to take their seat in Congress,<ref>{{cite web |title=An Act to admit the State of Texas to Representation in the Congress of the United States |website=Texas State Archives and Library Commission |url=https://www.tsl.texas.gov/ref/abouttx/secession/30march1870.html |accessdate=August 24, 2011}}</ref> although Texas did not meet all the formal requirements for readmission.\n\n==Notable Civil War leaders from Texas==\nA number of notable leaders were associated with Texas during the Civil War. [[John Bell Hood]] gained fame as the commander of the [[Texas Brigade]] in the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] and played a prominent role as an army commander late in the war. [[Lawrence Sullivan Ross|\"Sul\" Ross]] was a significant leader in a number of \"[[Trans-Mississippi]]\" Confederate armies. [[Felix Huston Robertson]] was the only native Texan Confederate general. Capt. [[TJ Goree]] was one of Lt. General [[James Longstreet]]'s most trusted aides. [[John Henninger Reagan|John H. Reagan]] was an influential member of [[Jefferson Davis]]'s cabinet. Col. [[Santos Benavides]] was a Confederate colonel during the American Civil War. Benavides was the highest-ranking Tejano soldier to serve in the Confederate military.\n\nThe office of [[Governor of Texas]] was in flux throughout the war, with several men in power at various times. [[Sam Houston]] was governor when Texas seceded from the United States, but refused to declare any loyalty to the new Confederacy. He was replaced by Lieutenant Governor [[Edward Clark (governor)|Edward Clark]]. Clark filled the rest of Houston's term in 1861, and narrowly lost re-election by just 124 votes to [[Francis Lubbock]]. During his tenure, Lubbock supported Confederate [[conscription]], working to draft all able-bodied men, including resident aliens, into the Confederate army. When Lubbock's term ended in 1863, he joined the military. Ardent secessionist [[Pendleton Murrah]] replaced him in office. Even after [[Robert E. Lee]] surrendered in 1865, Murrah encouraged Texans to continue the revolution, and he and several supporters fled to Mexico.\n\n===Notable Civil War leaders (Confederacy) from Texas===\n<gallery>\nImage:Francis lubbock.jpg|<center>Governor<br />[[Francis Lubbock]]</center>\nImage:JohnHReagan.jpg|<center>Postmaster General<br />[[John Henninger Reagan]]</center>\nImage:ASJohnston.jpg|<center>Gen.<br />[[A.

As with those of other States, the Declaration was not recognized by the United States government at Washington.

By February 1861, the other six states of the sub-region had separately passed ordinances of secession. However, events in Texas were delayed, largely due to the resistance of [[Southern Unionist]] governor, [[Sam Houston]]. Unlike the other \"cotton states\"' chief executives, who took the initiative in secessionist efforts, Houston refused to call the [[Texas Legislature]] into special session to consider the question, relenting only when it became apparent citizens were prepared to act without him.\n\nIn early December 1860, before South Carolina even seceded, a group of State officials published via newspaper a call for a statewide election of convention delegates on January 8, 1861. This election was highly irregular, even for the standards of the day. It often relied on voice vote at public meetings, although \"[[Voice vote|viva voce]]\" (voice) voting for popular elections had been used since at least March 1846, less than three months after statehood.<ref>An Act to direct the mode of voting in all popular elections, approved March 19, 1846. {{cite book|title=The Laws of Texas, 1822-1897|volume=2|editor-first=H.P.N.|editor-last=Gammel|editorlink=Hans Peter Mareus Neilsen Gammel|year=1898|page=1318|publisher=[[University of North Texas]]|url=http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth6726/m1/1322/|ref={{harvid|Gammel|1898b}}}}</ref> Unionists were often discouraged from attending or chose not to participate.

The following day, convention president Oran Roberts introduced a resolution suggesting Texas leave the Union.\nThe ordinance was read on the floor the next day, citing the failures of the federal government to protect the lives and property of Texas citizens and accusing the Northern states of using the same as a weapon to \"strike down the interests and prosperity\"<ref name=\"Ordinance of Secession\" /> of the Southern people.\n  \nAfter the grievances were listed, the ordinance repealed the one of July 4, 1845, in which Texas approved annexation by the [[United States]] and the [[Constitution of the United States]], and revoked all powers of, obligations to, and allegiance to, the U.S. federal government and the U.S. Constitution.<ref name=\"Ordinance of Secession\" />\n\nIn the interests of historical significance and posterity, the ordinance was written to take effect on March 2, the date of [[Texas Declaration of Independence]] (and, coincidentally, Houston's birthday).\n\nOn February 1, members of the Legislature, and a huge crowd of private citizens, packed the House galleries and balcony to watch the final vote on the question of secession. Seventy \"yea\" votes were recorded before there was a single \"nay.\" One of the negative votes is enshrined in Texas history books. [[James W. Throckmorton|James Webb Throckmorton]], from Collin County in North Texas, in response to the roar of hisses and boos and catcalls which greeted his decision, retorted, \"When the rabble hiss, well may patriots tremble.\" Appreciating his style, the crowd afforded him a grudging round of applause (like many Texans who initially opposed secession, Throckmorton accepted the result and served his state, rising to the rank of brigadier-general in the Confederate army).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Minor |first=David |title=Throckmorton, James Webb |work=Handbook of Texas Online |publisher=Texas State Historical Association |url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fth36 |date=November 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe final tally for secession was 166\u20137{{cn span|, a vote whose legality was upheld by the Texas Legislature on February 7|date=January 2016}}.

On March 4, the convention assembled again to formally declare Texas out of the Union and to approve the \"Constitution of the Confederate States of America\", which had been drawn up by its \"Provisional Congress\" (as it turned out, Texas had already been admitted into the fold on March 1).\n\nIn March, George Williamson, the Louisianan state commissioner, addressed the Texan secession convention, where he called upon Texas and the slave states of the U.S. to declare secession from the Union in order to continue the institution of slavery:\n\n{{Quotation|With the social balance wheel of slavery to regulate its machinery, we may fondly indulge the hope that our Southern government will be perpetual...

Instead, he urged that Texas revert to its former status as an independent republic and stay neutral. Houston took his seat on March 16, the date state officials were scheduled to take an oath of allegiance to the Confederacy. He remained silent as his name was called out three times and, after failing to respond, the office of governor was declared vacant and Houston was deposed from office.\n\n===Seizure of federal property and arms===\nAfter Texas passed its Ordinance of Secession, the state government appointed four men as \"Commissioners of Public Safety\" to negotiate with the federal government for the safe transfer of military installations and bases in Texas to the Confederates. Along with land baron [[Samuel A. Maverick]] and Thomas J. Devine, Dr. [[Philip N. Luckett]] met with [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] General [[David E. Twiggs]] on February 8, 1861, to arrange the surrender of the federal property in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], including the military stores being housed in the old [[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|Alamo mission]].\n\nAs a result of the negotiations, Twiggs delivered his entire command and its associated Army property (10,000 rifled muskets) to the Confederacy, an act that brought cries of treason from Unionists throughout the state.<ref>{{cite book |last=Roberts |first=O.M. |author-link=Oran Milo Roberts |title=Texas |editor-link=Clement A.

The referendum on the issue indicated that some 25% favored remaining in the Union at the time the question was originally considered.\n\nThe largest concentration of anti-secession sentiment was among the [[German Texan]] population in the [[Texas Hill Country]], and in some of the counties of [[North Texas]]. In the latter region, most of the residents were originally from states of the [[Upper South]].

Young on the orders of Colonel James Bourland, Confederate Provost Marshal for northern Texas. A court was convened in Gainesville to try them for allegedly plotting to seize the arsenals at Sherman and Gainesville and to kill their Confederate neighbors, seize their property, and to cooperate with Union army forces poised to invade northern Texas from Arkansas and/or Indian Territory. Several of the settlers were hanged in what is now downtown Gainesville during the first week of October. Nineteen additional men were found guilty and hanged before the end of the month. A total of about forty Unionists were [[Great Hanging at Gainesville|hanged in Gainesville]], two were shot while trying to escape, and two more were hanged elsewhere after being turned over to a military tribunal. Under the primitive conditions on the Texas frontier during the Civil War, evidence against the accused was questionable, and the legal proceedings were highly imperfect. A granite monument in a small park marks the spot where the hangings took place.<ref name=\"Great Hanging\"/>\n\nThe Confederacy's conscription act proved controversial, not only in Texas but all across the South. Despite the referendum result, some opponents argued that the war was being fought by poor people on behalf of a few wealthy [[Slavery in the United States|slave owners]].

While he argued for slave property rights and deplored the election of the Lincoln Administration, he considered secession unconstitutional and thought secession at that moment in time was a \"rash action\" that was certain to lead to a conflict favoring the industrial and populated North. He predicted: \"Let me tell you what is coming. After the sacrifice of countless millions of treasure and hundreds of thousands of lives, you may win Southern independence if God be not against you, but I doubt it. I tell you that, while I believe with you in the doctrine of states rights, the North is determined to preserve this Union.

The state furnished the Confederacy with 45 regiments of cavalry, 23 regiments of infantry, 12 battalions of cavalry, 4 battalions of infantry, 5 regiments of heavy artillery, and 30 batteries of light artillery. The state maintained at its own expense some additional troops that were for home defense. These included 5 regiments and 4 battalions of cavalry, and 4 regiments and one battalion of infantry. In 1862 the [[Confederate Congress]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]], passed a [[conscription|conscription law]] that ordered all men from 18 to 45 years of age to be placed into military service except ministers, state, city, county officers, and certain slave owners; all persons holding 20 slaves or more were exempt from Confederate conscription under the \"[[Twenty Negro Law]]\".<ref>{{Cite book|authorlink=James W.

Often serving as \"shock troops\" of General [[Robert E. Lee]]'s [[Army of Northern Virginia]], the Texas Brigade was \"always favorites\" of General Lee and on more than one occasion Lee praised their fighting qualities, remarking that none had brought greater honor to their native state than \"my Texans.\" Hood's men suffered severe casualties in a number of fights, most notably at the [[Battle of Antietam]], where they faced off with Wisconsin's [[Iron Brigade]], and at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]], where they assaulted Houck's Ridge and then [[Little Round Top]].\n\n\"[[Walker's Greyhounds|Walker's Greyhound Division]]\" was a [[division (military)|division]] composed of four brigades with Texan units; the only division in the [[Confederate States Army]] that maintained its single-state composition throughout the War. Formed in 1862 under command of Major General [[John George Walker]] it fought in the Western Theater and the Trans-Mississippi Department, and was considered an elite backbone of the army. Detached from the division in 1863, the 4th brigade fought at the [[Battle of Arkansas Post]], where it became isolated and was forced to surrender. A new fourth brigade was added the division in 1865.\n\nAmong the most famous mounted units were [[Terry's Texas Rangers]], a militia of former rangers and frontiersmen, many of whom later became peacekeepers in the Old West; and the 33rd Texas Cavalry Regiment of Colonel [[Santos Benavides]], which guarded the Confederate cotton trade lines from Texas into northern Mexico.\n\nOver 2,000 Texas men joined the [[Union Army]]. Notable among them was future Texas governor [[Edmund J. Davis]] who initially commanded the Union Army's [[1st Texas Cavalry Regiment (Union)|1st Texas Cavalry Regiment]] and rose to the rank of [[brigadier general]].\n\nTexas's relatively large [[German American|German]] population around [[Austin County]] led by [[Paul Machemehl]] tried to remain neutral in the War but eventually left Confederate Texas for Mexico. [[East Texas]] gave the most support to secession, and the only East Texas counties in which significant numbers of people opposed secession were [[Angelina County, Texas|Angelina County]], [[Fannin County, Texas|Fannin County]], and [[Lamar County, Texas|Lamar County]], although these counties supplied many men to Texas regiments, including the 9th Texas Infantry Regiment; the 1st Partisan Rangers; 3rd, 4th, 9th, 27th, and 29th Texas Cavalry; and the 9th Texas Field Battery.\n\nIn 1862, [[Abraham Lincoln]] named a former [[United States Congressman]], [[Andrew J.

During the early stages of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] Hamilton was named as the first provisional civilian governor. For a time thereafter, active-duty U.S. Army officers served as military governors of Texas.\n\nYears into the war, one Confederate soldier from Texas gave his reasons for fighting for the Confederacy, stating that \"we are fighting for our property\", whereas Union soldiers were fighting for the \"flimsy and abstract idea that a negro is equal to an Anglo\".<ref name=JMMcPherson1997p117>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/forcausecomrades00mcph|url-access=registration|title=For Cause and Comrades: Why Men Fought in the Civil War|page=[https://archive.org/details/forcausecomrades00mcph/page/117 117]|last=McPherson|first=James M.|date=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc.|oclc=34912692|location=New York City, New York|authorlink=James M.

However, the Union mounted several attempts to capture the \"[[Trans-Mississippi]]\" regions of Texas and [[Louisiana]] from 1862 until the war's end. With ports to the east captured or under blockade, Texas in particular became a [[Texas_in_the_American_Civil_War#Texas_occupation|blockade-running haven]]. \n\n==Texas occupation==\nUnder the [[Anaconda Plan]], the [[Union Navy]] blockaded the principal seaport, [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]] and the entire Gulf and Southern borders, for four years, and federal troops occupied the city for three months in late 1862. Confederate troops under Gen. [[John B. Magruder]] recaptured the city on January 1, 1863 and it remained in Confederate hands until the end of the war. A few days later the Confederate raider [[CSS Alabama|CSS ''Alabama'']] attacked and sank the [[USS Hatteras (1861)|USS ''Hatteras'']] in a naval engagement off the coast of Galveston. \n\n[[File:Scott-anaconda.jpg|thumb|left|Anaconda Plan, Civil War]]\n\n[[Wends_of_Texas#Civil_War-era|Civilian]] [[Blockade#Blockade_running|Blockade Runners]] largely evaded the Union blockades, bandits, and Union-sympathetic Mexicans in order to smuggle cotton out of [[Bagdad,_Tamaulipas|The Port of Bagdad, Mexico]] at a premium in exchange for goods on [[Europe]]an and [[black markets]]<ref>https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/drw01</ref>, as Texas offered an unparalleled and significant opportunity to export Southern cotton out of the Confederacy. [[President Lincoln]] referred to the strategic importance of this economic movement through the [[Rio Grande]] to the [[Edwin Stanton|Secretary of War, Edwin Stanton]] in 1863 stating, \"no local object is now more desirable.\"<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=QxywnKkZSlYC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA130#v=onepage&q&f=false</ref> The Rio Grande Expedition, led by [[Nathaniel P. Banks|General Nathaniel P. Banks]], was then sent forth to secure the ports near [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]] and pushed 100 miles in-land, in order to impede the flow of cotton and deny freedom of movement.\n\nA few other cities also fell to Union troops at times during the war, including [[Port Lavaca, Texas|Port Lavaca]], [[Indianola, Texas|Indianola]], and [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]]. Federal attempts to seize control of [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]], [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]], and [[Sabine Pass]] failed. By the end of the war no territory but [[Brazos Island]] and El Paso was in Union hands.  The [[California Column]] occupied the region around El Paso from 1862 to the end of the war.\n\nThe most notable military battle in Texas during the war happened on September 8, 1863. At the [[Second Battle of Sabine Pass]], a small garrison of 46 Confederates from the mostly-Irish Davis Guards under Lt. [[Richard W. Dowling]], 1st Texas Heavy Artillery, defeated a much larger Union force from [[New Orleans]] under Gen. [[William B. Franklin]]. Skilled gunnery by Dowling's troops disabled the lead ships in Franklin's flotilla, prompting the remainder\u20144,000 men on 27 ships\u2014to retreat back to New Orleans. This victory against such overwhelming odds resulted in the Confederate Congress passing a special resolution of recognition, and the only contemporary military decoration of the South, the [[Davis Guard Medal]].<ref>{{cite web |title=War Medals of the Confederacy: The Davis Guard Medal |website=20-20site.org |url=http://www.2020site.org/medals/davisguard.html |access-date=November 5, 2015}}</ref> CSA President [[Jefferson Davis]] stated, \"Sabine Pass will stand, perhaps for all time, as the greatest military victory in the history of the world.\"\n\nIn 1864, many Texas forces, including a division under [[Camille de Polignac]], a French prince and Confederate general, moved into Northwestern Louisiana to stall Union Maj. Gen. [[Nathaniel Banks]]' [[Red River Campaign]], which was intended to advance into Texas from its eastern border. [[Confederate army|Confederate forces]] halted the expedition at the [[Battle of Mansfield]], just east of the Texas border.\n\nUnion forces from Brazos Island launched the Brazos Santiago Expedition, leading to the last battle of the Civil War, the [[Battle of Palmito Ranch]], fought in Texas on May 12, 1865, well after [[Robert E. Lee]]'s surrender on April 9, 1865, at [[Old Appomattox Court House]], [[Virginia]].\n\n==Collapse of Confederate authority in Texas==\nIn the spring of 1865, Texas contained over 60,000 soldiers of the Army of the [[Trans-Mississippi]] under General [[Edmund Kirby Smith]]. As garrison troops far removed from the main theaters of the war, morale had deteriorated to the point of frequent desertion and thievery. News of the surrender of Lee and other Confederate generals east of the Mississippi finally reached Texas around April 20. Local Confederate authorities had mixed opinions on their future course of action. Most senior military leaders vowed to press on with the war, including commanding general Kirby Smith. Many soldiers, however, greeted frequent speeches whose theme was \"fight on, boys\" with derision, or simply failed to attend them.\n\nThe month of May brought increasing rates of desertion. News of [[Joseph E. Johnston]]'s and [[Richard Taylor (general)|Richard Taylor]]'s surrenders confirmed that Texas, [[Louisiana]], and [[Arkansas]] were now essentially alone to continue the Confederate cause. On May 14, troops in Galveston briefly mutinied, but were persuaded to remain under arms. However, morale continued to sink. Generals [[John B. Magruder]] and Kirby Smith (who had already corresponded with Union Maj. Gen. [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]] regarding surrender terms on May 9) no longer sought to rally their demoralized troops, but rather began discussing the distribution of Confederate government property. Magruder pleaded that the rapid disbanding of the army would prevent depredations by disgruntled soldiers against the civilian population.\n\nThe haste to disband the army, combined with the pressing need to protect Confederate property from Union confiscation, created general mayhem. Soldiers began openly pillaging the Galveston quartermasters stores on May 21. Over the next few days, a mob demanded that a government warehouse be opened to them, and soldiers detained and plundered a train. Several hundred civilians sacked the [[blockade runner]] ''Lark'' when it docked on May 24, and troops sent to pacify the crowd soon joined in the plunder. On May 23, residents in Houston sacked the ordnance building and the clothing bureau. Riots continued in the city until May 26. Both government and private stores were raided extensively in Tyler, Marshall, Huntsville, Gonzales, Hempstead, La Grange, and Brownsville. In Navasota, a powder explosion cost eight lives and flattened twenty buildings. In Austin, the State Treasury was raided and $17,000 in gold was stolen. By May 27, half of the original Confederate forces in Texas had deserted or been disbanded, and formal order had disappeared into lawlessness in many areas of Texas.\n\nThe formal remnants of Kirby Smith's army had finally disintegrated by the end of May. Upon his arrival in Houston from [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]], the general called a court of inquiry to investigate the \"causes and manner of the disbandment of the troops in the District of Texas, New Mexico and Arizona.\" The May 30 findings laid the blame primarily on the civilian population. Kirby Smith addressed his few remaining soldiers and condemned those that had fled for not struggling to the last and leaving him \"a commander without an army\u2013 a General without troops.\" On June 2, he formally surrendered what was left of the Army of the \"Trans-Mississippi\".\n\n==Restoration to the Union==\nFederal troops didn't arrive in Texas to restore order until June 19, 1865, when Union Maj. Gen. [[Gordon Granger]] and 2,000 Union soldiers arrived on [[Galveston Island]] to take possession of the state and enforce the new freedoms of former slaves. The Texas holiday [[Juneteenth]] commemorates this date. The Stars and Stripes were not raised over Austin until June 25.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Breakup: The Collapse of the Confederate Trans-Mississippi Army in Texas, 1865 |first=Brad R. |last=Clampitt |journal=Southwestern Historical Quarterly |publisher=Texas State Historical Association |volume=108 |issue=4 |date=April 2005 |jstor=30240424}}</ref>\n\nPresident [[Andrew Johnson]] appointed Union General [[Andrew J. Hamilton]], a prominent politician before the war, as the provisional governor on June 17. He granted amnesty to ex-Confederates if they promised to support the Union in the future, appointing some to office. On March 30, 1870, the [[United States Congress]] permitted Texas' representatives to take their seat in Congress,<ref>{{cite web |title=An Act to admit the State of Texas to Representation in the Congress of the United States |website=Texas State Archives and Library Commission |url=https://www.tsl.texas.gov/ref/abouttx/secession/30march1870.html |accessdate=August 24, 2011}}</ref> although Texas did not meet all the formal requirements for readmission.\n\n==Notable Civil War leaders from Texas==\nA number of notable leaders were associated with Texas during the Civil War. [[John Bell Hood]] gained fame as the commander of the [[Texas Brigade]] in the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] and played a prominent role as an army commander late in the war. [[Lawrence Sullivan Ross|\"Sul\" Ross]] was a significant leader in a number of \"[[Trans-Mississippi]]\" Confederate armies. [[Felix Huston Robertson]] was the only native Texan Confederate general. Capt. [[TJ Goree]] was one of Lt. General [[James Longstreet]]'s most trusted aides. [[John Henninger Reagan|John H. Reagan]] was an influential member of [[Jefferson Davis]]'s cabinet. Col. [[Santos Benavides]] was a Confederate colonel during the American Civil War. Benavides was the highest-ranking Tejano soldier to serve in the Confederate military.\n\nThe office of [[Governor of Texas]] was in flux throughout the war, with several men in power at various times. [[Sam Houston]] was governor when Texas seceded from the United States, but refused to declare any loyalty to the new Confederacy. He was replaced by Lieutenant Governor [[Edward Clark (governor)|Edward Clark]]. Clark filled the rest of Houston's term in 1861, and narrowly lost re-election by just 124 votes to [[Francis Lubbock]]. During his tenure, Lubbock supported Confederate [[conscription]], working to draft all able-bodied men, including resident aliens, into the Confederate army. When Lubbock's term ended in 1863, he joined the military. Ardent secessionist [[Pendleton Murrah]] replaced him in office. Even after [[Robert E. Lee]] surrendered in 1865, Murrah encouraged Texans to continue the revolution, and he and several supporters fled to Mexico.\n\n===Notable Civil War leaders (Confederacy) from Texas===\n<gallery>\nImage:Francis lubbock.jpg|<center>Governor<br />[[Francis Lubbock]]</center>\nImage:JohnHReagan.jpg|<center>Postmaster General<br />[[John Henninger Reagan]]</center>\nImage:ASJohnston.jpg|<center>Gen.<br />[[A.

In many cultures it is only acceptable for an individual to embody one of two polar gender roles. Gender roles often mimic the social expectations of the sexual categories of \"male\" and \"female\". Within this cultural expectation, people designated as male are expected to be masculine, while those designated female are expected to be feminine.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gender Trouble: Tenth Anniversary Edition|last=Butler|first=Judith|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=0415389550|location=New York, NY|pages=10\u201311|quote=}}</ref> The belief in and subscription to polar gender roles is known as gender binarism.\n\nIn many cultures, for a person to be seen as belonging to a particular gender category, the individual must not only have a particular anatomical (including genital) makeup, but must conform to that culture's ideas of appropriate sex-role stereotypes.

Gender bending can also be achieved through [[cross-dressing]] and [[androgyny]], both of which challenge and contribute to dismantling the gender binary by separating expression or performance of gender from perceptions of [[biological]] or [[physiological]] sex. Thus, gender bending protests gender [[essentialism]]. This concept is protested not only through non-normative appearance, but by challenging normative gender roles, characteristics, or behaviors as well \u2013 for example, a female-bodied individual who is purposefully assertive and nondomestic in order to challenge the notion of essential femininity. Gender bending is based in [[gender performativity]]: the concept of gender as a performance. It can be achieved through physical presentation (e.g. clothing, hair, makeup, and secondary sex characteristics), as well as behavior. Because much of gender performance is expressed through clothing, in societies where a gender binary can be observed, there is an established, widespread notion that some clothes are \"masculine\" and should be worn only by male-bodied individuals, and others are \"feminine\" and should be worn only by female-bodied individuals. Hawkes, sociologist and author, addresses this \"dress code\" and the opportunity for a resistance: \"The universality of [dress] codes and their meanings allows for the [subversion of] the mainstream 'messages' they convey and through this to illuminate the existence of alternative [gender] identities.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hawkes |first1=Gail L. |title=Dressing\u2010up \u2014 cross\u2010dressing and sexual dissonance |journal=Journal of Gender Studies |date=1995 |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=261\u2013270 |doi=10.1080/09589236.1995.9960612}}</ref>\n\n===Cross-dressing and androgyny===\nCross-dressing would be a form of gender bending because the purpose is to \"fuck with gender\" roles and presentation. [[Androgyny]] is not specifically gender bending, but it can be considered as such if someone is being androgynous on purpose. Many people who are androgynous may not make a conscious effort to look so.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The origin of the word \"[[androgynous]]\" is from the Greek ''androgynos'': \"male and female in one; womanish man; common to men and women\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Online Etymology Dictionary: androgynous|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=androgynous|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nThere have been many famous people who have cross-dressed and many famous people now who are androgynous. The rock star [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] was very well known for his cross-dressing or androgynous look. [[Eddie Izzard]] started to freely talk about his cross-dressing as early as 1992.\n\n[[Shakespeare]] used cross-dressing in his performances. Over the centuries some readers have posited that Shakespeare's sonnets are autobiographical,<ref>{{Harvnb|Lee|1900|loc=55}}</ref> and point to them as evidence of his love for a young man. With this said, Shakespeare had characters in his writings that were considered cross-dressers. The four of the five main female characters in his plays were seen as women who cross-dress as men or boys: Cleopatra in [[Antony and Cleopatra]], Portia in [[The Merchant of Venice]], Rosalind in [[As You Like It]], Viola in [[Twelfth Night]].\n\nGender bending is seen through many forms of life. One of these forms is [[Drag (clothing)|drag]].\n\n===Drag===\n[[Drag (clothing)|Drag shows]] are stage performances where people perform in [[drag (clothing)|drag]]. Drag costuming and makeup may in some cases simply involve an actor portraying a character of a sex or gender different from their own, or the performance itself may be a parody or critique of gender and gender roles. Often \"feminine\" or \"masculine\" gender stereotypes of the person's culture are exaggerated for comic or satirical effect. Performers may call themselves [[drag king]]s or [[drag queen]]s. Drag revues typically involve elaborate, glamorous costumes and musical performances. The entertainers may sing, dance, or [[lip sync]].\n\nA faux drag performer is a person who performs as the gender they identify as in day-to-day life, albeit in a usually exaggerated form. For instance a cisgender woman who performs as a drag queen is a [[faux queen]] or the other way around for a faux king.\n\n\"In order to understand the differences and similarities between gay male drag queens and female-bodied and transgender drag kings and bio queens, we consider how the personal gender and sexual identities of drag performers affect and are affected by their gender performances in drag.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rupp |first=Leila |author2=Taylor, Verta |author3=Shapiro, Eve |title=Drag Queens and Drag Kings: The Difference Gender Makes |journal=Sexualities |date=June 8, 2010 |volume=13 |issue=275 |pages=278 |doi=10.1177/1363460709352725 }}<!--|accessdate=June 4, 2012--></ref>\n\n===Literature===\nLiterature, in particular [[erotica]], is another method that has been used to explore genderfuck scenarios. The basis of the literary genre of genderfuck is that it's unimportant whether someone is a man or a woman during the sex act. Doris Libetseder points to [[Carol Queen]]'s short story ''The Leather Daddy and the Femme'', where a lesbian [[butch and femme|femme]] uses a [[strap-on dildo]] to have sex with a gay leather [[daddy (gay slang)|daddy]] as a fitting example of the genderfuck genre.<ref>{{cite book|last=Leibetseder|first=Doris|title=Queer Tracks: Subversive Strategies in Rock and Pop Music|year=2013|publisher=Ash gate Publishing Ltd|isbn=978-1409472032|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M1cxkUZNMKwC}}</ref>\n\n==Non-political gender bending==\nGender bending is not always a purposeful political standpoint. According to Butler, gender is something that is [[gender performance|performed]]; it only holds cultural significance to the extent that this is ascribed to it. Despite the [[gender binary]] roles society imposes, there are many ways for individuals to express gender variation and not all of them are intentionally [[political radicalism]].<ref name=Butler /> Further, in 1995 Tamsin Wilton argued that: <blockquote>\nGender-fuck is not intrinsically radical \u2013 otherwise gender-benders such as [[Boy George]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Annie Lennox]], [[David Bowie]] etc. would not get away with it to the extent that they do. A politically aware gender-fuck \u2013 such as that of [[RuPaul]] or (to a limited extent) [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] \u2013 gets much closer to radicalism, but it is only by incorporating a critique of gender ''as an axis of power'' that playing about with gender signifiers can be more than wickedly entertaining<ref>{{cite book|last=Wilton|first=Tamsin|title=Lesbian Studies: Setting an Agenda|year=1995|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415086566|pages=[https://archive.org/details/lesbianstudiesse00wilt/page/109 109]|url=https://archive.org/details/lesbianstudiesse00wilt|url-access=registration}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Judith Butler and gender as performance==\n[[Judith Butler]] is one of the most well-known theorists who believe the idea that gender is something that is performed by individuals. Her concept of \"[[gender performativity]]\" is the idea that people choose to perform gender in a context in which we are given very few socially acceptable choices, but can be explained as being similar to what actors do in front of the camera. Due to the importance we place on the belief that men need to act like men and women need to behave like women, it is often believed that gender is an innate attribute and not a social construct. In her article ''Performative Acts and Gender Constitution: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory'', Butler explains that if gender is something that sexed bodies assimilate to in order to follow the societal codes of what is appropriate behavior, then those actions can be conceptualized in different ways to allow more flexibility for individuals. In the same article, she asserts that in U.S. culture, there is a gender binary along with strict social repercussions against those that act against the \"normal\" script. This script is policed by harassment, parental pressures to fill expectations, and peer influence. All of these are ways to guarantee that the culture will repeat itself from generation to generation.<ref name=Butler>{{cite web|last=Butler|first=Judith|title=Performative Acts and Gender Construction: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory|url=http://www.mariabuszek.com/kcai/PoMoSeminar/Readings/BtlrPerfActs.pdf|accessdate=1 June 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112054310/http://www.mariabuszek.com/kcai/PoMoSeminar/Readings/BtlrPerfActs.pdf|archivedate=12 January 2012|df=}}</ref>\n\nJudith Butler's theory about gender roles and their social implications and need for reconstruction is more fully developed in her book, ''[[Gender Trouble]]'' (1990). She argues that the limited acceptance of variation in gender roles does great harm to individual expression. With the limited options for both men and women, there is little room for their combined forces, because men are constantly focused on becoming the financial supporters of their families which leaves women with the sole option of being the maternal expert she is expected to be. This idea excludes the masculine women or feminine men from being acceptable parental figures for their children because it may lead to a child growing up and conceptualizing the world differently.<ref name=Butler />\n\n==Gender and childraising==\nAccording to Susan Witt's 1997 study, children generally come to their first conclusions about being male or female from their parents since typically they are the first people the child relates to and the nature of the relationship is intense. Besides parents giving children gender specific clothing, toys, and expectations, there are often many subtle messages about what is acceptable or not regarding gender. Witt's study showed that children that grow up with more [[androgynous]] gendered parents are more focused on achievements and typically have a better sense of self.<ref>{{cite web|last=Witt|first=Susan D.|title=Parental Influence on Children's Socialization to Gender Roles|url=http://gozips.uakron.edu/~susan8/parinf.htm|publisher=University of Akron School of Home Economics and Family Ecology|accessdate=26 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120520230643/http://gozips.uakron.edu/~susan8/parinf.htm|archive-date=20 May 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Conversely, in cases of gender nonconformity, when a child exhibits [[gender performance]]s that are atypical of their prescribed gender role, Kerry Robinson and Cristyn Davies report that a parental figure may respond with hostility.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Kerry|first2=Cristyn |last2=Davies|title=Tomboys and Sissy Girls: young girls' negotiations of femininity and masculinity |url=https://uws.academia.edu/KerryRobinson/Papers/319023/Tomboys_and_Sissy_Girls_young_girls_negotiations_of_femininity_and_masculinity |journal=International Journal of Equity and Innovation in Early Childhood|volume=5|issue=7|pages=17\u201331|accessdate=26 May 2012}}</ref> According  to Roberts et al. in ''Pediatrics'', people who do not conform to the [[gender binary]] are often subject to abuse from society, from within the family and within their community.

These expectations are socially constructed and can vary widely between cultures. The [[gender binary]] is the idea that only two genders exist: men and women. In many cultures it is only acceptable for an individual to embody one of two polar gender roles. Gender roles often mimic the social expectations of the sexual categories of \"male\" and \"female\". Within this cultural expectation, people designated as male are expected to be masculine, while those designated female are expected to be feminine.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gender Trouble: Tenth Anniversary Edition|last=Butler|first=Judith|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=0415389550|location=New York, NY|pages=10\u201311|quote=}}</ref> The belief in and subscription to polar gender roles is known as gender binarism.\n\nIn many cultures, for a person to be seen as belonging to a particular gender category, the individual must not only have a particular anatomical (including genital) makeup, but must conform to that culture's ideas of appropriate sex-role stereotypes.

Gender bending can also be achieved through [[cross-dressing]] and [[androgyny]], both of which challenge and contribute to dismantling the gender binary by separating expression or performance of gender from perceptions of [[biological]] or [[physiological]] sex. Thus, gender bending protests gender [[essentialism]]. This concept is protested not only through non-normative appearance, but by challenging normative gender roles, characteristics, or behaviors as well \u2013 for example, a female-bodied individual who is purposefully assertive and nondomestic in order to challenge the notion of essential femininity. Gender bending is based in [[gender performativity]]: the concept of gender as a performance. It can be achieved through physical presentation (e.g. clothing, hair, makeup, and secondary sex characteristics), as well as behavior. Because much of gender performance is expressed through clothing, in societies where a gender binary can be observed, there is an established, widespread notion that some clothes are \"masculine\" and should be worn only by male-bodied individuals, and others are \"feminine\" and should be worn only by female-bodied individuals. Hawkes, sociologist and author, addresses this \"dress code\" and the opportunity for a resistance: \"The universality of [dress] codes and their meanings allows for the [subversion of] the mainstream 'messages' they convey and through this to illuminate the existence of alternative [gender] identities.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hawkes |first1=Gail L. |title=Dressing\u2010up \u2014 cross\u2010dressing and sexual dissonance |journal=Journal of Gender Studies |date=1995 |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=261\u2013270 |doi=10.1080/09589236.1995.9960612}}</ref>\n\n===Cross-dressing and androgyny===\nCross-dressing would be a form of gender bending because the purpose is to \"fuck with gender\" roles and presentation. [[Androgyny]] is not specifically gender bending, but it can be considered as such if someone is being androgynous on purpose. Many people who are androgynous may not make a conscious effort to look so.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The origin of the word \"[[androgynous]]\" is from the Greek ''androgynos'': \"male and female in one; womanish man; common to men and women\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Online Etymology Dictionary: androgynous|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=androgynous|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nThere have been many famous people who have cross-dressed and many famous people now who are androgynous. The rock star [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] was very well known for his cross-dressing or androgynous look. [[Eddie Izzard]] started to freely talk about his cross-dressing as early as 1992.\n\n[[Shakespeare]] used cross-dressing in his performances. Over the centuries some readers have posited that Shakespeare's sonnets are autobiographical,<ref>{{Harvnb|Lee|1900|loc=55}}</ref> and point to them as evidence of his love for a young man. With this said, Shakespeare had characters in his writings that were considered cross-dressers. The four of the five main female characters in his plays were seen as women who cross-dress as men or boys: Cleopatra in [[Antony and Cleopatra]], Portia in [[The Merchant of Venice]], Rosalind in [[As You Like It]], Viola in [[Twelfth Night]].\n\nGender bending is seen through many forms of life. One of these forms is [[Drag (clothing)|drag]].\n\n===Drag===\n[[Drag (clothing)|Drag shows]] are stage performances where people perform in [[drag (clothing)|drag]]. Drag costuming and makeup may in some cases simply involve an actor portraying a character of a sex or gender different from their own, or the performance itself may be a parody or critique of gender and gender roles. Often \"feminine\" or \"masculine\" gender stereotypes of the persons's culture are exaggerated for comic or satirical effect. Performers may call themselves [[drag king]]s or [[drag queen]]s. Drag revues typically involve elaborate, glamorous costumes and musical performances. The entertainers may sing, dance, or [[lip sync]].\n\nA faux drag performer is a person who performs as the gender they identify as in day-to-day life, albeit in a usually exaggerated form. For instance a cisgender woman who performs as a drag queen is a [[faux queen]] or the other way around for a faux king.\n\n\"In order to understand the differences and similarities between gay male drag queens and female-bodied and transgender drag kings and bio queens, we consider how the personal gender and sexual identities of drag performers affect and are affected by their gender performances in drag.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rupp |first=Leila |author2=Taylor, Verta |author3=Shapiro, Eve |title=Drag Queens and Drag Kings: The Difference Gender Makes |journal=Sexualities |date=June 8, 2010 |volume=13 |issue=275 |pages=278 |doi=10.1177/1363460709352725 }}<!--|accessdate=June 4, 2012--></ref>\n\n===Literature===\nLiterature, in particular [[erotica]], is another method that has been used to explore genderfuck scenarios. The basis of the literary genre of genderfuck is that it's unimportant whether someone is a man or a woman during the sex act. Doris Libetseder points to [[Carol Queen]]'s short story ''The Leather Daddy and the Femme'', where a lesbian [[butch and femme|femme]] uses a [[strap-on dildo]] to have sex with a gay leather [[daddy (gay slang)|daddy]] as a fitting example of the genderfuck genre.<ref>{{cite book|last=Leibetseder|first=Doris|title=Queer Tracks: Subversive Strategies in Rock and Pop Music|year=2013|publisher=Ash gate Publishing Ltd|isbn=978-1409472032|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M1cxkUZNMKwC}}</ref>\n\n==Non-political gender bending==\nGender bending is not always a purposeful political standpoint. According to Butler, gender is something that is [[gender performance|performed]]; it only holds cultural significance to the extent that this is ascribed to it. Despite the [[gender binary]] roles society imposes, there are many ways for individuals to express gender variation and not all of them are intentionally [[political radicalism]].<ref name=Butler /> Further, in 1995 Tamsin Wilton argued that: <blockquote>\nGender-fuck is not intrinsically radical \u2013 otherwise gender-benders such as [[Boy George]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Annie Lennox]], [[David Bowie]] etc. would not get away with it to the extent that they do. A politically aware gender-fuck \u2013 such as that of [[RuPaul]] or (to a limited extent) [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] \u2013 gets much closer to radicalism, but it is only by incorporating a critique of gender ''as an axis of power'' that playing about with gender signifiers can be more than wickedly entertaining<ref>{{cite book|last=Wilton|first=Tamsin|title=Lesbian Studies: Setting an Agenda|year=1995|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415086566|pages=[https://archive.org/details/lesbianstudiesse00wilt/page/109 109]|url=https://archive.org/details/lesbianstudiesse00wilt|url-access=registration}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Judith Butler and gender as performance==\n[[Judith Butler]] is one of the most well-known theorists who believe the idea that gender is something that is performed by individuals. Her concept of \"[[gender performativity]]\" is the idea that people choose to perform gender in a context in which we are given very few socially acceptable choices, but can be explained as being similar to what actors do in front of the camera. Due to the importance we place on the belief that men need to act like men and women need to behave like women, it is often believed that gender is an innate attribute and not a social construct. In her article ''Performative Acts and Gender Constitution: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory'', Butler explains that if gender is something that sexed bodies assimilate to in order to follow the societal codes of what is appropriate behavior, then those actions can be conceptualized in different ways to allow more flexibility for individuals. In the same article, she asserts that in U.S. culture, there is a gender binary along with strict social repercussions against those that act against the \"normal\" script. This script is policed by harassment, parental pressures to fill expectations, and peer influence. All of these are ways to guarantee that the culture will repeat itself from generation to generation.<ref name=Butler>{{cite web|last=Butler|first=Judith|title=Performative Acts and Gender Construction: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory|url=http://www.mariabuszek.com/kcai/PoMoSeminar/Readings/BtlrPerfActs.pdf|accessdate=1 June 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112054310/http://www.mariabuszek.com/kcai/PoMoSeminar/Readings/BtlrPerfActs.pdf|archivedate=12 January 2012|df=}}</ref>\n\nJudith Butler's theory about gender roles and their social implications and need for reconstruction is more fully developed in her book, ''[[Gender Trouble]]'' (1990). She argues that the limited acceptance of variation in gender roles does great harm to individual expression. With the limited options for both men and women, there is little room for their combined forces, because men are constantly focused on becoming the financial supporters of their families which leaves women with the sole option of being the maternal expert she is expected to be. This idea excludes the masculine women or feminine men from being acceptable parental figures for their children because it may lead to a child growing up and conceptualizing the world differently.<ref name=Butler />\n\n==Gender and childraising==\nAccording to Susan Witt's 1997 study, children generally come to their first conclusions about being male or female from their parents since typically they are the first people the child relates to and the nature of the relationship is intense. Besides parents giving children gender specific clothing, toys, and expectations, there are often many subtle messages about what is acceptable or not regarding gender. Witt's study showed that children that grow up with more [[androgynous]] gendered parents are more focused on achievements and typically have a better sense of self.<ref>{{cite web|last=Witt|first=Susan D.|title=Parental Influence on Children's Socialization to Gender Roles|url=http://gozips.uakron.edu/~susan8/parinf.htm|publisher=University of Akron School of Home Economics and Family Ecology|accessdate=26 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120520230643/http://gozips.uakron.edu/~susan8/parinf.htm|archive-date=20 May 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Conversely, in cases of gender nonconformity, when a child exhibits [[gender performance]]s that are atypical of their prescribed gender role, Kerry Robinson and Cristyn Davies report that a parental figure may respond with hostility.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Kerry|first2=Cristyn |last2=Davies|title=Tomboys and Sissy Girls: young girls' negotiations of femininity and masculinity |url=https://uws.academia.edu/KerryRobinson/Papers/319023/Tomboys_and_Sissy_Girls_young_girls_negotiations_of_femininity_and_masculinity |journal=International Journal of Equity and Innovation in Early Childhood|volume=5|issue=7|pages=17\u201331|accessdate=26 May 2012}}</ref> According  to Roberts et al. in ''Pediatrics'', people who do not conform to the [[gender binary]] are often subject to abuse from society, from within the family and within their community.
