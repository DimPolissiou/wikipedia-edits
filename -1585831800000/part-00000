When a specific poll does not show a data figure for a party, the party's cell corresponding to that poll is shown empty.\n\n===Graphical summary===\n[[File:Turkish polls 2023.png|1000px]]\n\n===Party vote===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; line-height:17px;\"\n|- style=\"height:42px; background:#e9e9e9;\"\n!class=\"unsortable\" rowspan=\"2\"| Date\n!class=\"unsortable\" rowspan=\"2\"| Polling firm\n!class=\"unsortable\"| [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|AKP]]\n!class=\"unsortable\"| [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|CHP]]\n!class=\"unsortable\"| [[Peoples' Democratic Party (Turkey)|HDP]]\n!class=\"unsortable\"| [[\u0130Y\u0130 Party|\u0130Y\u0130]] \n!class=\"unsortable\"| [[Nationalist Movement Party|MHP]]\n!class=\"unsortable\"| [[Felicity Party|SP]]\n!class=\"unsortable\"| [[Future Party (Turkey)|GP]]\n!class=\"unsortable\"| [[Democracy and Progress Party|DEVA]]\n!class=\"unsortable\"| Others\n!class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:40px;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Lead\n|-\n!class=\"unsortable\" style=\"background:{{Justice and Development Party (Turkey)/meta/color}}; width:40px;\" |\n!class=\"unsortable\" style=\"background:{{Republican People's Party (Turkey)/meta/color}}; width:40px;\"|\n!class=\"unsortable\" style=\"background:{{Peoples' Democratic Party (Turkey)/meta/color}}; width:40px;\"|\n!class=\"unsortable\" style=\"background:{{\u0130Y\u0130 Party/meta/color}}; width:40px;\" |\n!class=\"unsortable\" style=\"background:{{Nationalist Movement Party/meta/color}}; width:40px;\"|\n!class=\"unsortable\" style=\"background:{{Felicity Party/meta/color}}; width:40px;\"|\n!class=\"unsortable\" style=\"background:{{Future Party (Turkey)/meta/color}}; width:40px;\"|\n!class=\"unsortable\" style=\"background:{{Democracy and Progress Party/meta/color}}; width:40px;\"|\n!class=\"unsortable\" style=\"background:{{Independent politician/meta/color}}; width:40px;\"|\n|-\n|Mar 2020\n| [https://www.internethaber.com/adanin-son-anketinde-ali-babacanin-deva-partisi-surpriz-yapti-davutoglunu-gecti-2088115h.htm ADA]\n| style=\"background:#FFF1C4\"| '''38.3'''\n| 22.6\n| 9.7\n| 10.5\n| 11.2\n| 1.3\n| 2.0\n| 3.4\n| 1.0\n!

''Slashing Reginleiv''|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 2010 [[Action game|action]] [[video game]] developed by [[Sandlot (company)|Sandlot]] and published by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Wii]]. The story, based on [[Norse mythology]], follows the divine warriors Freyr and Freyja in their war against the [[J\u00f6tunn]], which heralds the coming of [[Ragnarok]]. Gameplay is mission-based, following one of the two protagonists as they fight hoards of enemies. Missions can be completed either in single-playing or in four-player [[Cooperative gameplay|co-op]]. Along with standard controls, the game supported the [[Wii MotionPlus]] expansion.\n\nDevelopment of ''Zangeki no Reginleiv'' began in 2006, though the concept was pitched before the Wii's launch. The world and characters' Norse origins were chosen due to that system's uncertain visual identity. The last year of production was turbulent due to requests from Nintendo about the controls and inclusion of co-op. It was the first Nintendo-published game given the \"D\" rating by Japan's [[Computer Entertainment Rating Organization|CERO]] rating system. As of 2020, the game remains exclusive to Japan. The game saw a mixed reception, and low sales in Japan.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Zangeki no Reginleiv gameplay.png|thumb|left|A mission in ''Zangeki no Reginleiv'', featuring four players in the online co-op mode.]]\n''Zangeki no Reginleiv'' is an [[Action game|action]] [[video game]] set in a world inspired by [[Norse mythology]].<ref name=\"1UP\"/> Players take on the role of sibling deities Freyr and Freyja, completing missions that involve defeating waves of enemy troops.<ref name=\"SilOpinion\"/><ref name=\"ReginleivSystem\"/> The game has two control options; the Classic Controller, and the [[Wii Remote]] and [[Wii Nunchuk|Nunchuk]].

Despite their best efforts, Freyr and Freyja cannot stop the J\u00f6tunn's advance. The situation is worsened by the emerging armies of [[Niflheim]] and [[Muspelheim]], and the release of three demonic weapons created by [[Loki]] during an earlier war with the giants. Asgard itself is eventually assaulted leading to the death of all the gods except Freyr and Freyja, followed by the final emergence of the Fire J\u00f6tunn [[Surtr]]. The world is left in ruin after Surt's defeat, but Freyja uses her powers to restore the world and humanity. The post-credits scene shows a modern world, where the gods have reincarnated as humans.\n\n==Development and release==\n[[Sandlot (company)|Sandlot]], best known for their work on the ''[[Earth Defense Force]]'' series, first pitched the concept of ''Zangeki no Reginleiv'' to [[Nintendo]] in 2004 alongside a project for the [[Nintendo DS]] called ''Ch\u014ds\u014dj\u016b Mecha MG''. Nintendo producer Hitoshi Yamagami was wary of such a large pitch, so agreed that the developer would make ''Ch\u014ds\u014dj\u016b Mecha MG'' and then go on to ''Zangeki no Reginleiv''. When production of ''Ch\u014ds\u014dj\u016b Mecha MG'' finished in 2006, the team were given the go-ahead to work on ''Zangeki no Reginleiv'', though both sides were wary of its scale. Originally the plan was for only 100 weapons to feature, but as the team got to grips with the Wii hardware, the number tripled. In 2009, a year before the planned release, Nintendo asked Sandlot to include co-op\u2014which the team had never tried before\u2014then control options for the Classic Controller and the Wii MotionPlus. These additional elements put a lot of strain on the team, with Yamagami describing it as a \"dark year\" for the team. A point of contention with Nintendo during the final six months was allowing a player to dismember enemies. Instead of cutting it altogether, Sandlot and Nintendo rationalised that since the violence was against hostile supernatural beings, it did not go against Nintendo's policy of not showing excessive violence against people.<ref name=\"NintendoInterview\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/interview/rznj/vol1/index.html|script-title=ja:\u793e\u9577\u304c\u8a0a\u304f\u300e\u65ac\u6483\u306eREGINLEIV\u300f|language=Japanese|website=[[Nintendo]]|date=2010|accessdate=2020-02-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310073743/https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/interview/rznj/vol1/index.html|archivedate=2013-03-10|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe early concept focused simply on making a fun game where players could slash at enemies, with the setting being a secondary consideration. Writer and director Takehiro Homma initially considered ancient Japan and a modern-day setting, but settled on a mythological setting to better explain the fantastic feats on display. Norse mythology was chosen as the world's base due to lacking a distinct visual identity when compared to [[Greek mythology]]. With this in mind, levels were designed to reflect the topography of the mythos as much as possible. Illustrator Haccan, who designed the main characters, was brought in as art director Masatsugu Igarashi liked his human character designs.<ref name=\"NintendoInterview\"/> Character model design was assisted by Optimo Graphico, an outsourcing company also working on ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles (video game)|Xenoblade Chronicles]]''.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Zangeki no Reginleiv|developer=[[Sandlot (company)|Sandlot]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|platform=[[Wii]]|date=2010-02-11|scene=Credits}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opgra.co.jp/works.html|script-title=ja:\u30aa\u30d7\u30c6\u30a3\u30e2\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30b3\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e - Works|language=Japanese|website=Optimo Graphico website|accessdate=2020-02-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031145853/http://www.opgra.co.jp/works.html|archivedate=2010-10-31|url-status=dead}}</ref> The music was composed by [[Masafumi Takada]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundprestige.jp/works.html|script-title=ja:\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u30d7\u30ec\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u5408\u540c\u4f1a\u793e|website=Masafumi Takada website|accessdate=2016-07-23|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324213116/http://www.soundprestige.jp/works.html|archivedate=2016-03-24|url-status=live}}</ref> Different voice clips were recorded for different battle situations, with the number and harshness causing the actors' voices to become hoarse by the end of recording.<ref name=\"NintendoInterview\"/>\n\nThe game was first announced at a special Nintendo press event in 2008 under the provisional title ''Dynamic Zan'', with a planned release for the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.famitsu.com/game/news/1218549_1124.html|script-title=ja:\u6012\u6fe4\u306e\u65b0\u4f5c\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5 \u4efb\u5929\u5802\u306eWii\u7528\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u306f\u307e\u3059\u307e\u3059\u5927\u5145\u5b9f|language=Japanese|website=[[Famitsu]]|date=2008-10-02|accessdate=2020-02-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213014436/https://www.famitsu.com/game/news/1218549_1124.html|archivedate=2010-02-13|url-status=live}}</ref> It was re-introduced under its official title in November 2009.

''Slashing Reginleiv''|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 2010 [[Action game|action]] [[video game]] developed by [[Sandlot (company)|Sandlot]] and published by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Wii]]. The story, based on [[Norse mythology]], follows the divine warriors Freyr and Freyja in their war against the [[J\u00f6tunn]], which heralds the coming of [[Ragnarok]]. Gameplay is mission-based, following one of the two protagonists as they fight hoards of enemies. Missions can be completed either in single-playing or in four-player [[Cooperative gameplay|co-op]]. Along with standard controls, the game supported the [[Wii MotionPlus]] expansion.\n\nDevelopment of ''Zangeki no Reginleiv'' began in 2006, though the concept was pitched before the Wii's launch. The world and characters' Norse origins were chosen due to that system's uncertain visual identity. The last year of production was turbulent due to requests from Nintendo about the controls and inclusion of co-op. It was the first Nintendo-published game given the \"D\" rating by Japan's [[Computer Entertainment Rating Organization|CERO]] rating system. As of 2020, the game remains exclusive to Japan. The game saw a mixed reception, and low sales in Japan.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Zangeki no Reginleiv gameplay.png|thumb|left|A mission in ''Zangeki no Reginleiv'', featuring four players in the online co-op mode.]]\n''Zangeki no Reginleiv'' is an [[Action game|action]] [[video game]] set in a world inspired by [[Norse mythology]].<ref name=\"1UP\"/> Players take on the role of sibling deities Freyr and Freyja, completing missions that involve defeating waves of enemy troops.<ref name=\"SilOpinion\"/><ref name=\"ReginleivSystem\"/> The game has two control options; the Classic Controller, and the [[Wii Remote]] and [[Wii Nunchuk|Nunchuk]].

In response to this attack, Asgard dispatches the twin deities Freyr and Freyja to aid humanity in defeating the giants.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/rznj/story/index.html|script-title=ja:\u65ac\u6483\u306eREGINLEIV\uff1a\u795e\u8a71|language=Japanese|website=Zangeki no Reginleiv official website|accessdate=2020-02-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150323053852/https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/rznj/story/index.html|archivedate=2015-03-23|url-status=live}}</ref> As the battles escalate, it becomes clear that the apocalypse [[Ragnarok]] is immanent. Despite their best efforts, Freyr and Freyja cannot stop the J\u00f6tunn's advance. The situation is worsened by the emerging armies of [[Niflheim]] and [[Muspelheim]], and the release of three demonic weapons created by [[Loki]] during an earlier war with the giants. Asgard itself is eventually assaulted leading to the death of all the gods except Freyr and Freyja, followed by the final emergence of the Fire J\u00f6tunn [[Surtr]]. The world is left in ruin after Surt's defeat, but Freyja uses her powers to restore the world and humanity. The post-credits scene shows a modern world, where the gods have reincarnated as humans.\n\n==Development and release==\n[[Sandlot (company)|Sandlot]], best known for their work on the ''[[Earth Defense Force]]'' series, first pitched the concept of ''Zangeki no Reginleiv'' to [[Nintendo]] in 2004 alongside a project for the [[Nintendo DS]] called ''Ch\u014ds\u014dj\u016b Mecha MG''. Nintendo producer Hitoshi Yamagami was wary of such a large pitch, so agreed that the developer would make ''Ch\u014ds\u014dj\u016b Mecha MG'' and then go on to ''Zangeki no Reginleiv''. When production of ''Ch\u014ds\u014dj\u016b Mecha MG'' finished in 2006, the team were given the go-ahead to work on ''Zangeki no Reginleiv'', though both sides were wary of its scale. Originally the plan was for only 100 weapons to feature, but as the team got to grips with the Wii hardware, the number tripled. In 2009, a year before the planned release, Nintendo asked Sandlot to include co-op\u2014which the team had never tried before\u2014then control options for the Classic Controller and the Wii MotionPlus. These additional elements put a lot of strain on the team, with Yamagami describing it as a \"dark year\" for the team. A point of contention with Nintendo during the final six months was allowing a player to dismember enemies. Instead of cutting it altogether, Sandlot and Nintendo rationalised that since the violence was against hostile supernatural beings, it did not go against Nintendo's policy of not showing excessive violence against people.<ref name=\"NintendoInterview\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/interview/rznj/vol1/index.html|script-title=ja:\u793e\u9577\u304c\u8a0a\u304f\u300e\u65ac\u6483\u306eREGINLEIV\u300f|language=Japanese|website=[[Nintendo]]|date=2010|accessdate=2020-02-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310073743/https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/interview/rznj/vol1/index.html|archivedate=2013-03-10|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe early concept focused simply on making a fun game where players could slash at enemies, with the setting being a secondary consideration. Writer and director Takehiro Homma initially considered ancient Japan and a modern-day setting, but settled on a mythological setting to better explain the fantastic feats on display. Norse mythology was chosen as the world's base due to lacking a distinct visual identity when compared to [[Greek mythology]].

At the age of ten, Mall's mother died, and his stepmother showed no affection towards him. Mall was unhappy in his childhood, and he had little opportunity to challenge his intellect both at home and in school. Mall later met John McCarthy, a teacher at the local academy who greatly impacted Mall's learning experience and life. Mall, in a personal correspondence, wrote that while he hated history as a child, Mr. McCarthy \"showed [him] he liked it.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> In addition, Mall had the support of his father who recognized the importance of education.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Sabin|first=Florence|date=|title=Biographical Memoir of Franklin Paine Mall|url=https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/images/0/05/Franklin_Mall_biography_1934.pdf|journal=National Academy of Sciences Biographical Memoirs|volume=16|pages=}}</ref> With this newfound appreciation of academic pursuit, Mall was able to attain higher education.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Education ===\nMall was accepted into the Department of Medicine at the&nbsp;[[University of Michigan]], the school where his family physician had received his training.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php/Embryology_History_-_Franklin_Mall|title=Embryology History - Franklin Mall|last=Hill|first=Mark|website=UNSW Embryology|access-date=2017-03-12}}</ref> During his time at Ann Arbor, Mall was drawn to three of his professors: Corydon Ford, Victor Vaughn, and Henry Sewall.<ref name=\":2\" />&nbsp;Mall was impressed by their pedagogical approach and their extensive knowledge in their respective fields.Their lectures were factual and objective; in addition, laboratory experiments were assigned to reinforce the knowledge that students had gained from lecture. Mall also noted that the majority of the students in his class favored rote memorization as a means to academic success. This was in contrast to his own preference for critical thinking and reasoning, a difference that emerged in his subsequent educational reforms.<ref name=\":2\" />&nbsp;\n\nMall graduated in June 1883 and went to Germany to further his education in 1884.<ref name=\":3\" /> He spent his first year abroad in Heidelberg to study ophthalmology. In Germany, Mall found his peers to be especially driven and better educated; they were independently planning their future studies. Mall heavily valued the freedom of choice and the liberty afforded to him while studying in Germany.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Franklin Paine Mall: An Appreciation|last=Meyer|first=Arthur|publisher=BiblioLife|isbn=978-1110793617|location=|pages=|date=August 2009}}</ref> In 1885, Mall went to Leipzig to begin his career in research under the guidance of [[Wilhelm His, Sr.|Wilhelm His]]. Mall's first project resulted in evidence that contradicted his mentor's position on the origin of the thymus, concluding that it develops from the endoderm instead of the ectoderm. His later revisited the issue and acknowledged the validity of Mall's work.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Sabin|first=Florence|date=1918|title=Franklin Paine Mall: A Review of His Scientific Achievement|url=|journal=Science|volume=47|issue=1211|pages=254\u2013261|doi=10.1126/science.47.1211.254|pmid=17796013}}</ref>&nbsp;During his time with His, Mall also started a collection of human embryos that he would continue to expand for the rest of his career.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWith His' recommendation, Mall moved to [[Carl Ludwig]]'s laboratory later that year, where he was assigned to study the blood vessels and lymphatics of the intestinal villus. Under Ludwig's tutelage, Mall learned methods of injecting blood vessels and lymphatics.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> Mall took apart the layers of the intestine to examine the blood supply of each layer and the organ as a whole. Using this knowledge, he constructed a model that demonstrated the circulatory relationship in the intestinal organ; he simplified the pattern of blood vessels into a five-ordered model that could be generalized to circulation in all organs. Mall's strong relationships with his mentors grew his curiosity and his affinity to scientific research. He later spread his focus on laboratory research to the American education system.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Personal life ===\nAs described by a student, Mall was modest and shy on outward appearance. He was cheerful and known to have a good sense of humor among his friends. Mall was deeply immersed in his research, heavily focused on solving any complications that were presented during the course of his work.<ref name=\":7\" /> Often deep in thought, Mall would sometimes be seen wandering around the hospital building and the city of Baltimore. Otherwise, he was known to be engrossed with work for long periods in his laboratory.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nMall first met Mabel Glover while teaching his first class at Johns Hopkins. They got married in 1894 and had two daughters, Margaret and Mary Louise Mall.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nMall fell ill after complications from a second operation for the removal of gallstones.

Training under&nbsp;[[William H.

While at Clark, Mall used the Born wax-plate method to create the first model of a human embryo in the United States. Furthermore, Mall discovered the vasomotor nerves of the portal vein and founded an embryological research program at the university.<ref name=\":0\" />&nbsp;In 1892, Mall followed [[Charles Otis Whitman]] to Chicago, becoming the professor of Anatomy at the&nbsp;[[University of Chicago]]. After a year in Chicago, Mall accepted a professorship at the then newly opened Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Return to Johns Hopkins University ===\nAccepting a personal request from [[William H.

Prior to Mall's exploits, medical schools would only conduct dissections in cold weather to stymie the decomposition of cadavers.

During his tenure, anatomy was deemed as a basic science, a prerequisite for entering the highly respected surgical field.

The collective research spearheaded by Mall and his coworkers at the Department of Anatomy demonstrated an impact comparable to that of the surgical field.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nMall's call for educational reform extended beyond anatomy to medical education in general. Mall argued that the largest obstacle was the professors and practitioners themselves, many of whom were involved in private practice.<ref name=\":8\" /> This, coupled with the lack of regulation of tenure faculty meant that students had greatly diminished learning opportunities. Mall was a strong critic of private practice, and felt strongly for the concept of a full-time faculty.

Firstly, it would require a large embryo collection for research. Subsequently, this collection would have to be staged to furnish a more complete understanding of embryonic development in humans. Secondly, the institution would have to be in a large city with a significant medical establishment, such as Berlin, Boston, or Baltimore. This would allow the institution to work closely with gynecologists and private practitioners to expand the collection. Lastly, Mall hoped that the institution would be located in a hub of medical activity where research and medical breakthroughs were continually occurring.<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite book|title=The Department of Embryology|last1=Maienschein|first1=Jane|last2=Glitz|first2=Marie|last3=Allen|first3=Garland|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2004|isbn=0-521-83082-6|location=|pages=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/centennialhistor0000unse_l3c4}}</ref>\n\nIn early 1913, Mall received a preliminary grant of $6000 from the Carnegie Institute for Science to organize a broad-spectrum lab addressing scientific problems of varying disciplines.<ref name=\":14\" /> The nature of the work was intentionally designed to be impossible to achieve without collaboration; this was to demonstrate the validity of Mall's argument for an entire Department of Embryology.<ref name=\":14\" /> In the next year, Mall recruited four researchers and many other skilled technicians, modelers, and artists from Europe and the United States to carry out the process of staging the embryos. This group of researchers eventually became the basis of the Department of Embryology.<ref name=\":14\" /> By the end of 1914, Mall successfully obtained a $15,000 grant to found and chair the Department of Embryology at the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]], that was to be housed in the Johns Hopkins University campus.<ref name=\":1\" /> He served as its first Director, assisted by [[George Linius Streeter]], who took over the Directorship on mall's death.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/3047.html|title=George Linius Streeter|website=www.whonamedit.com}}</ref>\n\n== Scientific research ==\nIn his 1905 publication in the [[American Journal of Anatomy]], Mall was the first to show that both the main arteries and the primary veins of the embryo pig could be reached by via the delivery of&nbsp;India Ink&nbsp;directly into the blood vessels of the liver.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite journal|date=1905|title=On the Development of the Blood-Vessels of the Brain in the Human Embryo|journal=American Journal of Anatomy|volume=4|pages=1\u201318|doi=10.1002/aja.1000040102|last1=Mall|first1=Franklin P.|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1423435}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sabin|first=Florence|date=1915|title=On the Fate of the Posterior Cardinal Veins and Their Relation to the Development of the Vena Cava and Azygos in the Embryo Pig|url=|journal=Contributions to Embryology|volume=3|pages=5\u201332}}</ref>&nbsp;\n\nIn 1907, Mall identified a precursor of the internal jugular vein in the head, naming it as the anterior cardinal vein.

At the age of ten, Mall's mother died, and his stepmother showed no affection towards him. Mall was unhappy in his childhood, and he had little opportunity to challenge his intellect both at home and in school. Mall later met John McCarthy, a teacher at the local academy who greatly impacted Mall's learning experience and life. Mall, in a personal correspondence, wrote that while he hated history as a child, Mr. McCarthy \"showed [him] he liked it.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> In addition, Mall had the support of his father who recognized the importance of education.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Sabin|first=Florence|date=|title=Biographical Memoir of Franklin Paine Mall|url=https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/images/0/05/Franklin_Mall_biography_1934.pdf|journal=National Academy of Sciences Biographical Memoirs|volume=16|pages=}}</ref> With this newfound appreciation of academic pursuit, Mall was able to attain higher education.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Education ===\nMall was accepted into the Department of Medicine at the&nbsp;[[University of Michigan]], the school where his family physician had received his training.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php/Embryology_History_-_Franklin_Mall|title=Embryology History - Franklin Mall|last=Hill|first=Mark|website=UNSW Embryology|access-date=2017-03-12}}</ref> During his time at Ann Arbor, Mall was drawn to three of his professors: Corydon Ford, Victor Vaughn, and Henry Sewall.<ref name=\":2\" />&nbsp;Mall was impressed by their pedagogical approach and their extensive knowledge in their respective fields.Their lectures were factual and objective; in addition, laboratory experiments were assigned to reinforce the knowledge that students had gained from lecture. Mall also noted that the majority of the students in his class favored rote memorization as a means to academic success. This was in contrast to his own preference for critical thinking and reasoning, a difference that emerged in his subsequent educational reforms.<ref name=\":2\" />&nbsp;\n\nMall graduated in June 1883 and went to Germany to further his education in 1884.<ref name=\":3\" /> He spent his first year abroad in Heidelberg to study ophthalmology. In Germany, Mall found his peers to be especially driven and better educated; they were independently planning their future studies.

Under Ludwig's tutelage, Mall learned methods of injecting blood vessels and lymphatics.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> Mall took apart the layers of the intestine to examine the blood supply of each layer and the organ as a whole. Using this knowledge, he constructed a model that demonstrated the circulatory relationship in the intestinal organ; he simplified the pattern of blood vessels into a five-ordered model that could be generalized to circulation in all organs. Mall's strong relationships with his mentors grew his curiosity and his affinity to scientific research. He later spread his focus on laboratory research to the American education system.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Personal life ===\nAs described by a student, Mall was modest and shy on outward appearance. He was cheerful and known to have a good sense of humor among his friends. Mall was deeply immersed in his research, heavily focused on solving any complications that were presented during the course of his work.<ref name=\":7\" /> Often deep in thought, Mall would sometimes be seen wandering around the hospital building and the city of Baltimore. Otherwise, he was known to be engrossed with work for long periods in his laboratory.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nMall first met Mabel Glover while teaching his first class at Johns Hopkins. They got married in 1894 and had two daughters, Margaret and Mary Louise Mall.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nMall fell ill after complications from a second operation for the removal of gallstones.

Sabin]] and George L. Streeter.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, one of Mall's students, [[Simon Flexner]], noted that Mall's pedagogical approach could not always replicate the same results elsewhere. The available study guides and the competence of the instructors were found to be essential to the success of Mall's curriculum.<ref name=\":7\" />&nbsp;\n\nOne of Mall's other goals was to raise the prestige of anatomists and the study of anatomy in America. During his tenure, anatomy was deemed as a basic science, a prerequisite for entering the highly respected surgical field. Mall's convictions led him to expand the anatomical curricula to include histology, histogenesis, and embryology. The collective research spearheaded by Mall and his coworkers at the Department of Anatomy demonstrated an impact comparable to that of the surgical field.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nMall's call for educational reform extended beyond anatomy to medical education in general. Mall argued that the largest obstacle was the professors and practitioners themselves, many of whom were involved in private practice.<ref name=\":8\" /> This, coupled with the lack of regulation of tenure faculty meant that students had greatly diminished learning opportunities. Mall was a strong critic of private practice, and felt strongly for the concept of a full-time faculty. Mall often argued with [[William Osler]] as a result of their contrasting opinions.<ref name=\":2\" /> He supported the ideals of [[William H. Welch]],&nbsp;[[Abraham Flexner]], and&nbsp;[[John D. Rockefeller]] in their bid for the reform of medical education.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Bryan|first1=Charles|last2=Stinson|first2=Shawn|date=2002|title=The Choice: Lewellys F.

Welch]] at the Johns Hopkins University. The collection continued to grow while working with Wilhelm His, further expanding after his return to the [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine|Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine]].<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite book|title=Developmental Stages of Human Embryos|last=O'Rahilly|first=Ronan|publisher=Carnegie Institution of Washington|year=1987|isbn=978-0-87279-666-9|location=|pages=}}</ref> In his 1917 paper studying abnormal embryo and fetus growth, Mall reported that his collection consisted of approximately 2000 embryos, growing quickly at the rate of about 400 a year.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Franklin P.

In collaboration with Franz Keibel, Mall published the ''Manual of Human Embryology'' in 1912.<ref name=\":12\" /> The book described the piecewise development of the human body from the embryo and compiled substantial knowledge from the available scientific literature.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php/Book_-_Manual_of_Human_Embryology|title=Book - Manual of Human Embryology|last=Hill|first=Mark|website=UNSW Embryology}}</ref>\n\nMall was also the first person to stage human embryos using photographs of their external structure, first grouping 226 human embryos into 14 stages. This was then expanded to 23 stages by Mall's successor, George L. Streeter.<ref name=\":12\" /> These 23 stages are the standard for the study of embryology and the Carnegie Collection of Embryos.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n=== Department of Embryology ===\nMall advocated strongly for the establishment of a specialized embryological institution. In a proposal to the&nbsp;Carnegie Institute for Science, Mall noted the sluggish advancements in anatomy and embryology compared to astronomy. This was despite the greater number of faculty and additional resources present within the biological fields.<ref>{{Cite book|title=American Neuroscience in the Twentieth Century|last1=Magoun|first1=Horace|last2=Marshall|first2=Louise|publisher=CRC Press|year=2003|isbn=9789026519383|location=|pages=86\u201387}}</ref>&nbsp;Mall championed the recruitment of scientific talents and the conducive organization of research institutes to efficiently conduct research.<ref name=\":11\" />&nbsp;In addition, Mall described the institute as a catalyst for the consolidation of embryonic collections which were scattered, poorly maintained, and possessed insufficient detail at that time.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nMall laid out several key requirements for this specialized institution. Firstly, it would require a large embryo collection for research. Subsequently, this collection would have to be staged to furnish a more complete understanding of embryonic development in humans. Secondly, the institution would have to be in a large city with a significant medical establishment, such as Berlin, Boston, or Baltimore. This would allow the institution to work closely with gynecologists and private practitioners to expand the collection. Lastly, Mall hoped that the institution would be located in a hub of medical activity where research and medical breakthroughs were continually occurring.<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite book|title=The Department of Embryology|last1=Maienschein|first1=Jane|last2=Glitz|first2=Marie|last3=Allen|first3=Garland|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2004|isbn=0-521-83082-6|location=|pages=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/centennialhistor0000unse_l3c4}}</ref>\n\nIn early 1913, Mall received a preliminary grant of $6000 from the Carnegie Institute for Science to organize a broad-spectrum lab addressing scientific problems of varying disciplines.<ref name=\":14\" /> The nature of the work was intentionally designed to be impossible to achieve without collaboration; this was to demonstrate the validity of Mall's argument for an entire Department of Embryology.<ref name=\":14\" /> In the next year, Mall recruited four researchers and many other skilled technicians, modelers, and artists from Europe and the United States to carry out the process of staging the embryos. This group of researchers eventually became the basis of the Department of Embryology.<ref name=\":14\" /> By the end of 1914, Mall successfully obtained a $15,000 grant to found and chair the Department of Embryology at the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]], that was to be housed in the Johns Hopkins University campus.<ref name=\":1\" /> He served as its first Director, assisted by [[George Linius Streeter]], who took over the Directorship on mall's death.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/3047.html|title=George Linius Streeter|website=www.whonamedit.com}}</ref>\n\n== Scientific research ==\nIn his 1905 publication in the [[American Journal of Anatomy]], Mall was the first to show that both the main arteries and the primary veins of the embryo pig could be reached by via the delivery of&nbsp;India Ink&nbsp;directly into the blood vessels of the liver.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite journal|date=1905|title=On the Development of the Blood-Vessels of the Brain in the Human Embryo|journal=American Journal of Anatomy|volume=4|pages=1\u201318|doi=10.1002/aja.1000040102|last1=Mall|first1=Franklin P.|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1423435}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sabin|first=Florence|date=1915|title=On the Fate of the Posterior Cardinal Veins and Their Relation to the Development of the Vena Cava and Azygos in the Embryo Pig|url=|journal=Contributions to Embryology|volume=3|pages=5\u201332}}</ref>&nbsp;\n\nIn 1907, Mall identified a precursor of the internal jugular vein in the head, naming it as the anterior cardinal vein.

This is in contrast to the significant distance observed between the endothelium and the heart muscle in other localities in the embryonic heart.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Manual of Human Embryology|last=Mall|first=Franklin P.|publisher=Philadelphia and London, J.

{"title_page": "Dependency grammar", "text_new": "{{Linguistics|Grammar}}\n'''Dependency grammar''' ('''DG''') is a class of modern [[Grammar|grammatical]] theories that are all based on the dependency relation (as opposed to the relation of [[Phrase structure grammar|phrase structure]]) and that can be traced back primarily to the work of [[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re]]. Dependency is the notion that linguistic units, e.g. words, are connected to each other by directed links. The (finite) verb is taken to be the structural center of clause structure. All other syntactic units (words) are either directly or indirectly connected to the verb in terms of the directed links, which are called ''dependencies''. DGs are distinct from [[phrase structure grammar]]s, since DGs lack phrasal nodes, although they acknowledge phrases. Structure is determined by the relation between a word (a [[Head (linguistics)|head]]) and its dependents. Dependency structures are flatter than phrase structures in part because they lack a [[finite verb|finite]] [[verb phrase]] [[constituent (linguistics)|constituent]], and they are thus well suited for the analysis of languages with free word order, such as [[Czech language|Czech]] or [[Warlpiri language|Warlpiri]].\n\n==History==\nThe notion of dependencies between grammatical units has existed since the earliest recorded grammars, e.g. [[P\u0101\u1e47ini]], and the dependency concept therefore arguably predates that of phrase structure by many centuries.<ref>Concerning the history of the dependency concept, see Percival (1990).</ref> [[Ibn Ma\u1e0d\u0101\u02be]], a 12th-century [[linguist]] from [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia]], may have been the first grammarian to use the term ''dependency'' in the grammatical sense that we use it today. In early modern times, the dependency concept seems to have coexisted side by side with that of phrase structure, the latter having entered Latin, French, English and other grammars from the widespread study of [[term logic]] of antiquity.<ref>Concerning the influence of term logic on the theory of grammar, see Percival (1976).</ref> Dependency is also concretely present in the works of [[S\u00e1muel Brassai]] (1800\u20131897), a Hungarian linguist, [[:de:Franz Kern (Philologe)|Franz Kern]] (1830-1894), a German philologist, and of [[Heimann Hariton Tiktin]] (1850\u20131936), a Romanian linguist.<ref>Concerning dependency in the works of Brassai, see Imr\u00e9nyi (2013). Concerning dependency in the works of Kern, see Kern's essays (e.g. Kern 1883, 1884). Concerning dependency in the works of Tiktin, see Coseriu (1980).</ref>\n\nModern dependency grammars, however, begin primarily with the work of [[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re]]. Tesni\u00e8re was a Frenchman, a [[polyglot]], and a professor of linguistics at the universities in Strasbourg and Montpellier. His major work ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments de syntaxe structurale'' was published posthumously in 1959 \u2013 he died in 1954. The basic approach to syntax he developed seems to have been seized upon independently by others in the 1960s<ref>Concerning early dependency grammars that may have developed independently of Tesni\u00e8re's work, see for instance Hays (1960), Gaifman (1965), and Robinson (1970).</ref> and a number of other dependency-based grammars have gained prominence since those early works.<ref>Some prominent dependency grammars that were well established by the 1980s are from Hudson (1984), Sgall, Haji\u010dov\u00e1 et Panevova (1986), Mel\u2019\u010duk (1988), and Starosta (1988).</ref> DG has generated a lot of interest in Germany<ref>Some prominent dependency grammars from the German schools are from Heringer (1996), Engel (1994), Eroms (2000), and \u00c1gel et al. (2003/6) is a massive two volume collection of essays on dependency grammar and valency theory from more than 100 authors.</ref> in both theoretical syntax and language pedagogy. In recent years, the great development surrounding dependency-based theories has come from [[computational linguistics]] and is due, in part, to the influential work that [[David G. Hays|David Hays]] did in machine translation at the [[RAND Corporation]] in the 1950s and 1960s. Dependency-based systems are increasingly being used to parse natural language and generate [[Treebank|tree banks]]. Interest in dependency grammar is growing at present, international conferences on dependency linguistics being a relatively recent development ([http://depling.org Depling 2011], [http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/depling13/ Depling 2013], [http://depling.org/depling2015/ Depling 2015], [http://www.depling.org/depling2017/call.html Depling 2017], [http://www.depling.org/depling2019/ Depling 2019]).\n\n==Dependency vs. phrase structure==\nDependency is a one-to-one correspondence: for every element (e.g. word or morph) in the sentence, there is exactly one node in the structure of that sentence that corresponds to that element. The result of this one-to-one correspondence is that dependency grammars are word (or morph) grammars. All that exist are the elements and the dependencies that connect the elements into a structure. This situation should be compared with [[Phrase structure grammar|phrase structure]]. Phrase structure is a one-to-one-or-more correspondence, which means that, for every element in a sentence, there is one or more nodes in the structure that correspond to that element. The result of this difference is that dependency structures are minimal<ref>The minimality of dependency structures is emphasized, for instance, by Ninio (2006), Hudson 2007: 117, and by Osborne et al. (2011).</ref> compared to their phrase structure counterparts, since they tend to contain many fewer nodes.\n\n::::[[File:Wearetryingtounderstandthedifference (2).jpg|Dependency vs. phrase structure]]\n\nThese trees illustrate two possible ways to render the dependency and phrase structure relations (see below). This dependency tree is an \"ordered\" tree, i.e. it reflects actual word order. Many dependency trees abstract away from linear order and focus just on hierarchical order, which means they do not show actual word order. This constituency (= phrase structure) tree follows the conventions of [[Minimalist program|bare phrase structure]] (BPS), whereby the words themselves are employed as the node labels.\n\nThe distinction between dependency and phrase structure grammars derives in large part from the initial division of the clause. The phrase structure relation derives from an initial binary division, whereby the clause is split into a subject [[noun phrase]] (NP) and a [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] [[verb phrase]] (VP). This division is certainly present in the basic analysis of the clause that we find in the works of, for instance, [[Leonard Bloomfield]] and [[Noam Chomsky]]. Tesni\u00e8re, however, argued vehemently against this binary division, preferring instead to position the verb as the root of all clause structure. Tesni\u00e8re's stance was that the subject-predicate division stems from [[term logic]] and has no place in linguistics.<ref>Concerning Tesni\u00e8re's rejection of the subject-predicate division of the clause, see Tesni\u00e8re (1959:103\u2013105), and for discussion of empirical considerations that support Tesni\u00e8re's point, see Matthews (2007:17ff.), Miller (2011:54ff.), and Osborne et al. (2011:323f.).</ref> The importance of this distinction is that if one acknowledges the initial subject-predicate division in syntax is real, then one is likely to go down the path of phrase structure grammar, while if one rejects this division, then one must consider the verb as the root of all structure, and so go down the path of dependency grammar.\n\n==Dependency grammars==\nThe following frameworks are dependency-based:\n[[File:Quranic-arabic-corpus.png|right|250px|thumb|Hybrid constituency/dependency tree from the [[Quranic Arabic Corpus]]]]\n\n::* [[Algebraic syntax]]\n::* [[Operator grammar]]\n::* [[Link grammar]]\n::* [[Functional generative description]]\n::* [[Lexicase]]\n::* [[Meaning\u2013text theory]]\n::* [[Word grammar]]\n::* [http://www.ps.uni-saarland.de/~rade/xdg.html Extensible dependency grammar]\n::* [[Universal Dependencies]]\n\n[[Link grammar]] is similar to dependency grammar, but link grammar does not include directionality between the linked words, and thus does not describe head-dependent relationships. Hybrid dependency/phrase structure grammar uses dependencies between words, but also includes dependencies between phrasal nodes \u2013 see for example the [[Quranic Arabic Corpus|Quranic Arabic Dependency Treebank]]. The derivation trees of [[tree-adjoining grammar]] are dependency structures, although the full trees of TAG rendered in terms of phrase structure, so in this regard, it is not clear whether TAG should be viewed more as a dependency or phrase structure grammar.\n\nThere are major differences between the grammars just listed. In this regard, the dependency relation is compatible with other major tenets of theories of grammar. Thus like phrase structure grammars, dependency grammars can be mono- or multistratal, representational or derivational, construction- or rule-based.\n\n==Representing dependencies==\nThere are various conventions that DGs employ to represent dependencies. The following schemata (in addition to the tree above and the trees further below) illustrate some of these conventions:\n\n::[[File:Conventions.jpg|Conventions for illustrating dependencies]]\n\nThe representations in (a\u2013d) are trees, whereby the specific conventions employed in each tree vary. Solid lines are ''dependency edges'' and lightly dotted lines are ''projection lines''. The only difference between tree (a) and tree (b) is that tree (a) employs the category class to label the nodes whereas tree (b) employs the words themselves as the node labels.<ref>The conventions illustrated with trees (a) and (b) are preferred by Osborne et al. (2011, 2013).</ref> Tree (c) is a reduced tree insofar as the string of words below and projection lines are deemed unnecessary and are hence omitted. Tree (d) abstracts away from linear order and reflects just hierarchical order.<ref>Unordered trees like (d) are associated above all with Tesni\u00e8re's stemmas and with the syntactic strata of Mel\u2019\u010duk's Meaning-Text Theory.</ref> The arrow arcs in (e) are an alternative convention used to show dependencies and are favored by [[Word grammar|Word Grammar]].<ref>Three major works on Word Grammar are Hudson (1984, 1990, 2007).</ref> The brackets in (f) are seldom used, but are nevertheless quite capable of reflecting the dependency hierarchy; dependents appear enclosed in more brackets than their heads. And finally, the indentations like those in (g) are another convention that is sometimes employed to indicate the hierarchy of words.<ref>Lobin (2003) makes heavy use of these indentations.</ref> Dependents are placed underneath their heads and indented. Like tree (d), the indentations in (g) abstract away from linear order.\n\nThe point to these conventions is that they are just that, namely conventions. They do not influence the basic commitment to dependency as the relation that is grouping syntactic units.\n\n==Types of dependencies==\nThe dependency representations above (and further below) show syntactic dependencies. Indeed, most work in dependency grammar focuses on syntactic dependencies. Syntactic dependencies are, however, just one of three or four types of dependencies. [[Meaning\u2013text theory]], for instance, emphasizes the role of semantic and morphological dependencies in addition to syntactic dependencies.<ref>For a discussion of semantic, morphological, and syntactic dependencies in Meaning-Text Theory, see Mel\u02b9c\u0306uk (2003:191ff.) and Osborne 2019: Ch. 5).</ref> A fourth type, prosodic dependencies, can also be acknowledged. Distinguishing between these types of dependencies can be important, in part because if one fails to do so, the likelihood that semantic, morphological, and/or prosodic dependencies will be mistaken for syntactic dependencies is great. The following four subsections briefly sketch each of these dependency types. During the discussion, the existence of syntactic dependencies is taken for granted and used as an orientation point for establishing the nature of the other three dependency types.\n\n===Semantic dependencies===\nSemantic dependencies are understood in terms of [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]]s and their [[Argument (linguistics)|argument]]s.<ref>Concerning semantic dependencies, see Mel\u02b9c\u0306uk (2003:192f.).</ref> The arguments of a predicate are semantically dependent on that predicate. Often, semantic dependencies overlap with and point in the same direction as syntactic dependencies. At times, however, semantic dependencies can point in the opposite direction of syntactic dependencies, or they can be entirely independent of syntactic dependencies. The hierarchy of words in the following examples show standard syntactic dependencies, whereas the arrows indicate semantic dependencies:\n\n::[[File:Semantic dependencies.png|Semantic dependencies]]\n\nThe two arguments ''Sam'' and ''Sally'' in tree (a) are dependent on the predicate ''likes'', whereby these arguments are also syntactically dependent on ''likes''. What this means is that the semantic and syntactic dependencies overlap and point in the same direction (down the tree). Attributive adjectives, however, are predicates that take their head noun as their argument, hence ''big'' is a predicate in tree (b) that takes ''bones'' as its one argument; the semantic dependency points up the tree and therefore runs counter to the syntactic dependency. A similar situation obtains in (c), where the preposition predicate ''on'' takes the two arguments ''the picture'' and ''the wall''; one of these semantic dependencies points up the syntactic hierarchy, whereas the other points down it. Finally, the predicate ''to help'' in (d) takes the one argument ''Jim'' but is not directly connected to ''Jim'' in the syntactic hierarchy, which means that that semantic dependency is entirely independent of the syntactic dependencies.\n\n===Morphological dependencies===\nMorphological dependencies obtain between words or parts of words.<ref>Concerning morphological dependencies, see Mel\u02b9c\u0306uk (2003:193ff.).</ref> When a given word or part of a word influences the form of another word, then the latter is morphologically dependent on the former. Agreement and concord are therefore manifestations of morphological dependencies. Like semantic dependencies, morphological dependencies can overlap with and point in the same direction as syntactic dependencies, overlap with and point in the opposite direction of syntactic dependencies, or be entirely independent of syntactic dependencies. The arrows are now used to indicate morphological dependencies.\n\n:[[File:Mophological dependencies 1.png|Morphological dependencies 1]]\n\nThe plural ''houses'' in (a) demands the plural of the demonstrative determiner, hence ''these'' appears, not ''this'', which means there is a morphological dependency that points down the hierarchy from ''houses'' to ''these''. The situation is reversed in (b), where the singular subject ''Sam'' demands the appearance of the agreement suffix ''-s'' on the finite verb ''works'', which means there is a morphological dependency pointing up the hierarchy from ''Sam'' to ''works''. The type of determiner in the German examples (c) and (d) influences the inflectional suffix that appears on the adjective ''alt''. When the indefinite article ''ein'' is used, the strong masculine ending ''-er'' appears on the adjective. When the definite article ''der'' is used, in contrast, the weak ending ''-e'' appears on the adjective. Thus since the choice of determiner impacts the morphological form of the adjective, there is a morphological dependency pointing from the determiner to the adjective, whereby this morphological dependency is entirely independent of the syntactic dependencies. Consider further the following French sentences:\n\n::[[File:Morphological dependencies 2'.png|Morphological dependencies 2']]\n\nThe masculine subject ''le chien'' in (a) demands the masculine form of the predicative adjective ''blanc'', whereas the feminine subject ''la maison'' demands the feminine form of this adjective. A morphological dependency that is entirely independent of the syntactic dependencies therefore points again across the syntactic hierarchy.\n\nMorphological dependencies play an important role in [[Linguistic typology|typological studies]]. Languages are classified as mostly [[Head-marking language|head-marking]] (''Sam work-s'') or mostly [[Dependent-marking language|dependent-marking]] (''these houses''), whereby most if not all languages contain at least some minor measure of both head and dependent marking.<ref>The distinction between head- and dependent-marking was established by Nichols (1986). Nichols was using a dependency-based understanding of these distinctions.</ref>\n\n===Prosodic dependencies===\nProsodic dependencies are acknowledged in order to accommodate the behavior of [[clitic]]s.<ref>Concerning prosodic dependencies and the analysis of clitics, see Gro\u00df (2011).</ref> A clitic is a syntactically autonomous element that is prosodically dependent on a host. A clitic is therefore integrated into the prosody of its host, meaning that it forms a single word with its host. Prosodic dependencies exist entirely in the linear dimension (horizontal dimension), whereas standard syntactic dependencies exist in the hierarchical dimension (vertical dimension). Classic examples of clitics in English are reduced auxiliaries (e.g. ''-ll'', ''-s'', ''-ve'') and the possessive marker ''-s''. The prosodic dependencies in the following examples are indicated with the hyphen and the lack of a vertical projection line:\n\n[[File:Prosodic dependencies'.png|Prosodic dependencies']]\n\nThe hyphens and lack of projection lines indicate prosodic dependencies. A hyphen that appears on the left of the clitic indicates that the clitic is prosodically dependent on the word immediately to its left (''He'll'', ''There's''), whereas a hyphen that appears on the right side of the clitic (not shown here) indicates that the clitic is prosodically dependent on the word that appears immediately to its right. A given clitic is often prosodically dependent on its syntactic dependent (''He'll'', ''There's'') or on its head (''would've''). At other times, it can depend prosodically on a word that is neither its head nor its immediate dependent (''Florida's'').\n\n===Syntactic dependencies===\nSyntactic dependencies are the focus of most work in DG, as stated above. How the presence and the direction of syntactic dependencies are determined is of course often open to debate. In this regard, it must be acknowledged that the validity of syntactic dependencies in the trees throughout this article is being taken for granted. However, these hierarchies are such that many DGs can largely support them, although there will certainly be points of disagreement. The basic question about how syntactic dependencies are discerned has proven difficult to answer definitively. One should acknowledge in this area, however, that the basic task of identifying and discerning the presence and direction of the syntactic dependencies of DGs is no easier or harder than determining the constituent groupings of phrase structure grammars. A variety of heuristics are employed to this end, basic [[constituent (linguistics)|tests for constituents]] being useful tools; the syntactic dependencies assumed in the trees in this article are grouping words together in a manner that most closely matches the results of standard permutation, substitution, and ellipsis tests for constituents. [[Etymology|Etymological]] considerations also provide helpful clues about the direction of dependencies. A promising principle upon which to base the existence of syntactic dependencies is distribution.<ref>Distribution is primary principle used by Owens (1984:36), Schubert (1988:40), and Mel\u02b9c\u0306uk (2003:200) for discerning syntactic dependencies.</ref> When one is striving to identify the root of a given phrase, the word that is most responsible for determining the distribution of that phrase as a whole is its root.\n\n==Linear order and discontinuities==\nTraditionally, DGs have had a different approach to linear order (word order) than phrase structure grammars. Dependency structures are minimal compared to their phrase structure counterparts, and these minimal structures allow one to focus intently on the two ordering dimensions.<ref>Concerning the importance of the two ordering dimensions, see Tesni\u00e8re (1959:16ff).</ref> Separating the vertical dimension (hierarchical order) from the horizontal dimension (linear order) is easily accomplished. This aspect of dependency structures has allowed DGs, starting with Tesni\u00e8re (1959), to focus on hierarchical order in a manner that is hardly possible for phrase structure grammars. For Tesni\u00e8re, linear order was secondary to hierarchical order insofar as hierarchical order preceded linear order in the mind of a speaker. The stemmas (trees) that Tesni\u00e8re produced reflected this view; they abstracted away from linear order to focus almost entirely on hierarchical order. Many DGs that followed Tesni\u00e8re adopted this practice, that is, they produced tree structures that reflect hierarchical order alone, e.g.\n\n::[[File:Dg-new-1.jpg|Two unordered trees]]\n\nThe traditional focus on hierarchical order generated the impression that DGs have little to say about linear order, and it has contributed to the view that DGs are particularly well-suited to examine languages with free word order. A negative result of this focus on hierarchical order, however, is that there is a dearth of DG explorations of particular word order phenomena, such as of standard [[Discontinuity (linguistics)|discontinuities]]. Comprehensive dependency grammar accounts of [[topicalization]], [[wh-movement|''wh''-fronting]], [[Scrambling (linguistics)|scrambling]], and [[extraposition]] are mostly absent from many established DG frameworks. This situation can be contrasted with phrase structure grammars, which have devoted tremendous effort to exploring these phenomena.\n\nThe nature of the dependency relation does not, however, prevent one from focusing on linear order. Dependency structures are as capable of exploring word order phenomena as phrase structures. The following trees illustrate this point; they represent one way of exploring discontinuities using dependency structures. The trees suggest the manner in which common discontinuities can be addressed. An example from German is used to illustrate a scrambling discontinuity:\n\n::[[File:Dg-new-2.jpg|8 ordered trees]]\n\nThe a-trees on the left show [[discontinuity (linguistics)|projectivity]] violations (= crossing lines), and the b-trees on the right demonstrate one means of addressing these violations. The displaced constituent takes on a word as its [[head (linguistics)|head]] that is not its [[government (linguistics)|governor]]. The words in red mark the [[Catena (linguistics)|catena]] (=chain) of words that extends from the root of the displaced constituent to the [[government (linguistics)|governor]] of that constituent.<ref>See Osborne et al. (2012) concerning catenae.</ref> Discontinuities are then explored in terms of these catenae. The limitations on topicalization, ''wh''-fronting, scrambling, and extraposition can be explored and identified by examining the nature of the catenae involved.\n\n==Syntactic functions==\nTraditionally, DGs have treated the syntactic functions (= grammatical functions, [[grammatical relation]]s) as primitive. They posit an inventory of functions (e.g. subject, object, oblique, determiner, attribute, predicative, etc.). These functions can appear as labels on the dependencies in the tree structures, e.g.<ref>For discussion and examples of the labels for syntactic functions that are attached to dependency edges and arcs, see for instance Mel'cuk (1988:22, 69) and van Valin (2001:102ff.).</ref>\n\n::[[File:Syntactic functions 1.png|Syntactic functions 1]]\n\nThe syntactic functions in this tree are shown in green: ATTR (attribute), COMP-P (complement of preposition), COMP-TO (complement of to), DET (determiner), P-ATTR (prepositional attribute), PRED (predicative), SUBJ (subject), TO-COMP (to complement). The functions chosen and abbreviations used in the tree here are merely representative of the general stance of DGs toward the syntactic functions. The actual inventory of functions and designations employed vary from DG to DG.\n\nAs a primitive of the theory, the status of these functions is much different than in some phrase structure grammars. Traditionally, phrase structure grammars derive the syntactic functions from the constellation. For instance, the object is identified as the NP appearing inside finite VP, and the subject as the NP appearing outside of finite VP. Since DGs reject the existence of a finite VP constituent, they were never presented with the option to view the syntactic functions in this manner. The issue is a question of what comes first: traditionally, DGs take the syntactic functions to be primitive and they then derive the constellation from these functions, whereas phrase structure grammars traditionally take the constellation to be primitive and they then derive the syntactic functions from the constellation.\n\nThis question about what comes first (the functions or the constellation) is not an inflexible matter. The stances of both grammar types (dependency and phrase structure) is not narrowly limited to the traditional views. Dependency and phrase structure are both fully compatible with both approaches to the syntactic functions. Indeed, monostratal systems, be they based dependency or phrase structure, will likely reject the notion that the functions are derived from the constellation or that the constellation is derived from the functions. They will take both to be primitive, which means neither can be derived from the other.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Catena (linguistics)|Catena]]\n*[[Constituent (linguistics)|Constituent]]\n*[[Dependency relation]] (in mathematics)\n*[[Discontinuity (linguistics)|Discontinuity]]\n*[[Finite verb]]\n*[[Head-directionality parameter]]\n*[[Igor Mel'\u010duk]]\n*[[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re]]\n*[[Phrase structure grammar]]\n*[[Predicate (grammar)|Predicate]]\n*[[Verb phrase]]\n*[[Universal Dependencies]]\n*[[Parse tree]]\n*[[Tree (data structure)]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*{{cite book|editor1-last=\u00c1gel |editor1-first=Vilmos |editor2-last=Eichinger |editor2-first=Ludwig M. |editor3-last=Eroms |editor3-first=Hans Werner |editor4-last=Hellwig |editor4-first=Peter |editor5-last=Heringer |editor5-first=Hans J\u00fcrgen |editor6-last=Lobin |editor6-first=Henning |title=Dependenz und Valenz:Ein internationales Handbuch der zeitgen\u00f6ssischen Forschung |trans-title=Dependency and Valency:An International Handbook of Contemporary Research |year=2003 |publisher=de Gruyter |location=Berlin |language=German |isbn=978-3110141900 |url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/serial/18595 |accessdate=24 August 2012}}\n*Coseriu, E. 1980.

Dependency is the notion that linguistic units, e.g. words, are connected to each other by directed links. The (finite) verb is taken to be the structural center of clause structure. All other syntactic units (words) are either directly or indirectly connected to the verb in terms of the directed links, which are called ''dependencies''. DGs are distinct from [[phrase structure grammar]]s, since DGs lack phrasal nodes, although they acknowledge phrases. Structure is determined by the relation between a word (a [[Head (linguistics)|head]]) and its dependents. Dependency structures are flatter than phrase structures in part because they lack a [[finite verb|finite]] [[verb phrase]] [[constituent (linguistics)|constituent]], and they are thus well suited for the analysis of languages with free word order, such as [[Czech language|Czech]] or [[Warlpiri language|Warlpiri]].\n\n==History==\nThe notion of dependencies between grammatical units has existed since the earliest recorded grammars, e.g. [[P\u0101\u1e47ini]], and the dependency concept therefore arguably predates that of phrase structure by many centuries.<ref>Concerning the history of the dependency concept, see Percival (1990).</ref> [[Ibn Ma\u1e0d\u0101\u02be]], a 12th-century [[linguist]] from [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia]], may have been the first grammarian to use the term ''dependency'' in the grammatical sense that we use it today. In early modern times, the dependency concept seems to have coexisted side by side with that of phrase structure, the latter having entered Latin, French, English and other grammars from the widespread study of [[term logic]] of antiquity.<ref>Concerning the influence of term logic on the theory of grammar, see Percival (1976).</ref> Dependency is also concretely present in the works of [[S\u00e1muel Brassai]] (1800\u20131897), a Hungarian linguist, [[:de:Franz Kern (Philologe)|Franz Kern]] (1830-1894), a German philologist, and of [[Heimann Hariton Tiktin]] (1850\u20131936), a Romanian linguist.<ref>Concerning dependency in the works of Brassai, see Imr\u00e9nyi (2013). Concerning dependency in the works of Kern, see Kern's essays (e.g. Kern 1883, 1884). Concerning dependency in the works of Tiktin, see Coseriu (1980).</ref>\n\nModern dependency grammars, however, begin primarily with the work of [[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re]]. Tesni\u00e8re was a Frenchman, a [[polyglot]], and a professor of linguistics at the universities in Strasbourg and Montpellier. His major work ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments de syntaxe structurale'' was published posthumously in 1959 \u2013 he died in 1954. The basic approach to syntax he developed seems to have been seized upon independently by others in the 1960s<ref>Concerning early dependency grammars that may have developed independently of Tesni\u00e8re's work, see for instance Hays (1960), Gaifman (1965), and Robinson (1970).</ref> and a number of other dependency-based grammars have gained prominence since those early works.<ref>Some prominent dependency grammars that were well established by the 1980s are from Hudson (1984), Sgall, Haji\u010dov\u00e1 et Panevova (1986), Mel\u2019\u010duk (1988), and Starosta (1988).</ref> DG has generated a lot of interest in Germany<ref>Some prominent dependency grammars from the German schools are from Heringer (1996), Engel (1994), Eroms (2000), and \u00c1gel et al. (2003/6) is a massive two volume collection of essays on dependency grammar and valency theory from more than 100 authors.</ref> in both theoretical syntax and language pedagogy. In recent years, the great development surrounding dependency-based theories has come from [[computational linguistics]] and is due, in part, to the influential work that [[David G. Hays|David Hays]] did in machine translation at the [[RAND Corporation]] in the 1950s and 1960s. Dependency-based systems are increasingly being used to parse natural language and generate [[Treebank|tree banks]]. Interest in dependency grammar is growing at present, international conferences on dependency linguistics being a relatively recent development ([http://depling.org Depling 2011], [http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/depling13/ Depling 2013], [http://depling.org/depling2015/ Depling 2015], [http://www.depling.org/depling2017/call.html Depling 2017], [http://www.depling.org/depling2019/ Depling 2019]).\n\n==Dependency vs. phrase structure==\nDependency is a one-to-one correspondence: for every element (e.g. word or morph) in the sentence, there is exactly one node in the structure of that sentence that corresponds to that element. The result of this one-to-one correspondence is that dependency grammars are word (or morph) grammars. All that exist are the elements and the dependencies that connect the elements into a structure. This situation should be compared with [[Phrase structure grammar|phrase structure]]. Phrase structure is a one-to-one-or-more correspondence, which means that, for every element in a sentence, there is one or more nodes in the structure that correspond to that element. The result of this difference is that dependency structures are minimal<ref>The minimality of dependency structures is emphasized, for instance, by Ninio (2006), Hudson 2007: 117, and by Osborne et al. (2011).</ref> compared to their phrase structure counterparts, since they tend to contain many fewer nodes.\n\n::::[[File:Wearetryingtounderstandthedifference (2).jpg|Dependency vs. phrase structure]]\n\nThese trees illustrate two possible ways to render the dependency and phrase structure relations (see below). This dependency tree is an \"ordered\" tree, i.e. it reflects actual word order. Many dependency trees abstract away from linear order and focus just on hierarchical order, which means they do not show actual word order. This constituency (= phrase structure) tree follows the conventions of [[Minimalist program|bare phrase structure]] (BPS), whereby the words themselves are employed as the node labels.\n\nThe distinction between dependency and phrase structure grammars derives in large part from the initial division of the clause. The phrase structure relation derives from an initial binary division, whereby the clause is split into a subject [[noun phrase]] (NP) and a [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] [[verb phrase]] (VP). This division is certainly present in the basic analysis of the clause that we find in the works of, for instance, [[Leonard Bloomfield]] and [[Noam Chomsky]]. Tesni\u00e8re, however, argued vehemently against this binary division, preferring instead to position the verb as the root of all clause structure. Tesni\u00e8re's stance was that the subject-predicate division stems from [[term logic]] and has no place in linguistics.<ref>Concerning Tesni\u00e8re's rejection of the subject-predicate division of the clause, see Tesni\u00e8re (1959:103\u2013105), and for discussion of empirical considerations that support Tesni\u00e8re's point, see Matthews (2007:17ff.), Miller (2011:54ff.), and Osborne et al. (2011:323f.).</ref> The importance of this distinction is that if one acknowledges the initial subject-predicate division in syntax is real, then one is likely to go down the path of phrase structure grammar, while if one rejects this division, then one must consider the verb as the root of all structure, and so go down the path of dependency grammar.\n\n==Dependency grammars==\nThe following frameworks are dependency-based:\n[[File:Quranic-arabic-corpus.png|right|250px|thumb|Hybrid constituency/dependency tree from the [[Quranic Arabic Corpus]]]]\n\n::* [[Algebraic syntax]]\n::* [[Operator grammar]]\n::* [[Link grammar]]\n::* [[Functional generative description]]\n::* [[Lexicase]]\n::* [[Meaning\u2013text theory]]\n::* [[Word grammar]]\n::* [http://www.ps.uni-saarland.de/~rade/xdg.html Extensible dependency grammar]\n::* [[Universal Dependencies]]\n\n[[Link grammar]] is similar to dependency grammar, but link grammar does not include directionality between the linked words, and thus does not describe head-dependent relationships. Hybrid dependency/phrase structure grammar uses dependencies between words, but also includes dependencies between phrasal nodes \u2013 see for example the [[Quranic Arabic Corpus|Quranic Arabic Dependency Treebank]]. The derivation trees of [[tree-adjoining grammar]] are dependency structures, although the full trees of TAG rendered in terms of phrase structure, so in this regard, it is not clear whether TAG should be viewed more as a dependency or phrase structure grammar.\n\nThere are major differences between the grammars just listed. In this regard, the dependency relation is compatible with other major tenets of theories of grammar. Thus like phrase structure grammars, dependency grammars can be mono- or multistratal, representational or derivational, construction- or rule-based.\n\n==Representing dependencies==\nThere are various conventions that DGs employ to represent dependencies. The following schemata (in addition to the tree above and the trees further below) illustrate some of these conventions:\n\n::[[File:Conventions.jpg|Conventions for illustrating dependencies]]\n\nThe representations in (a\u2013d) are trees, whereby the specific conventions employed in each tree vary. Solid lines are ''dependency edges'' and lightly dotted lines are ''projection lines''. The only difference between tree (a) and tree (b) is that tree (a) employs the category class to label the nodes whereas tree (b) employs the words themselves as the node labels.<ref>The conventions illustrated with trees (a) and (b) are preferred by Osborne et al. (2011, 2013).</ref> Tree (c) is a reduced tree insofar as the string of words below and projection lines are deemed unnecessary and are hence omitted. Tree (d) abstracts away from linear order and reflects just hierarchical order.<ref>Unordered trees like (d) are associated above all with Tesni\u00e8re's stemmas and with the syntactic strata of Mel\u2019\u010duk's Meaning-Text Theory.</ref> The arrow arcs in (e) are an alternative convention used to show dependencies and are favored by [[Word grammar|Word Grammar]].<ref>Three major works on Word Grammar are Hudson (1984, 1990, 2007).</ref> The brackets in (f) are seldom used, but are nevertheless quite capable of reflecting the dependency hierarchy; dependents appear enclosed in more brackets than their heads. And finally, the indentations like those in (g) are another convention that is sometimes employed to indicate the hierarchy of words.<ref>Lobin (2003) makes heavy use of these indentations.</ref> Dependents are placed underneath their heads and indented. Like tree (d), the indentations in (g) abstract away from linear order.\n\nThe point to these conventions is that they are just that, namely conventions. They do not influence the basic commitment to dependency as the relation that is grouping syntactic units.\n\n==Types of dependencies==\nThe dependency representations above (and further below) show syntactic dependencies. Indeed, most work in dependency grammar focuses on syntactic dependencies. Syntactic dependencies are, however, just one of three or four types of dependencies. [[Meaning\u2013text theory]], for instance, emphasizes the role of semantic and morphological dependencies in addition to syntactic dependencies.<ref>For a discussion of semantic, morphological, and syntactic dependencies in Meaning-Text Theory, see Mel\u02b9c\u0306uk (2003:191ff.) and Osborne 2019: Ch. 5).</ref> A fourth type, prosodic dependencies, can also be acknowledged. Distinguishing between these types of dependencies can be important, in part because if one fails to do so, the likelihood that semantic, morphological, and/or prosodic dependencies will be mistaken for syntactic dependencies is great. The following four subsections briefly sketch each of these dependency types. During the discussion, the existence of syntactic dependencies is taken for granted and used as an orientation point for establishing the nature of the other three dependency types.\n\n===Semantic dependencies===\nSemantic dependencies are understood in terms of [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]]s and their [[Argument (linguistics)|argument]]s.<ref>Concerning semantic dependencies, see Mel\u02b9c\u0306uk (2003:192f.).</ref> The arguments of a predicate are semantically dependent on that predicate. Often, semantic dependencies overlap with and point in the same direction as syntactic dependencies. At times, however, semantic dependencies can point in the opposite direction of syntactic dependencies, or they can be entirely independent of syntactic dependencies. The hierarchy of words in the following examples show standard syntactic dependencies, whereas the arrows indicate semantic dependencies:\n\n::[[File:Semantic dependencies.png|Semantic dependencies]]\n\nThe two arguments ''Sam'' and ''Sally'' in tree (a) are dependent on the predicate ''likes'', whereby these arguments are also syntactically dependent on ''likes''. What this means is that the semantic and syntactic dependencies overlap and point in the same direction (down the tree). Attributive adjectives, however, are predicates that take their head noun as their argument, hence ''big'' is a predicate in tree (b) that takes ''bones'' as its one argument; the semantic dependency points up the tree and therefore runs counter to the syntactic dependency. A similar situation obtains in (c), where the preposition predicate ''on'' takes the two arguments ''the picture'' and ''the wall''; one of these semantic dependencies points up the syntactic hierarchy, whereas the other points down it. Finally, the predicate ''to help'' in (d) takes the one argument ''Jim'' but is not directly connected to ''Jim'' in the syntactic hierarchy, which means that that semantic dependency is entirely independent of the syntactic dependencies.\n\n===Morphological dependencies===\nMorphological dependencies obtain between words or parts of words.<ref>Concerning morphological dependencies, see Mel\u02b9c\u0306uk (2003:193ff.).</ref> When a given word or part of a word influences the form of another word, then the latter is morphologically dependent on the former. Agreement and concord are therefore manifestations of morphological dependencies. Like semantic dependencies, morphological dependencies can overlap with and point in the same direction as syntactic dependencies, overlap with and point in the opposite direction of syntactic dependencies, or be entirely independent of syntactic dependencies. The arrows are now used to indicate morphological dependencies.\n\n:[[File:Mophological dependencies 1.png|Morphological dependencies 1]]\n\nThe plural ''houses'' in (a) demands the plural of the demonstrative determiner, hence ''these'' appears, not ''this'', which means there is a morphological dependency that points down the hierarchy from ''houses'' to ''these''. The situation is reversed in (b), where the singular subject ''Sam'' demands the appearance of the agreement suffix ''-s'' on the finite verb ''works'', which means there is a morphological dependency pointing up the hierarchy from ''Sam'' to ''works''. The type of determiner in the German examples (c) and (d) influences the inflectional suffix that appears on the adjective ''alt''. When the indefinite article ''ein'' is used, the strong masculine ending ''-er'' appears on the adjective. When the definite article ''der'' is used, in contrast, the weak ending ''-e'' appears on the adjective. Thus since the choice of determiner impacts the morphological form of the adjective, there is a morphological dependency pointing from the determiner to the adjective, whereby this morphological dependency is entirely independent of the syntactic dependencies. Consider further the following French sentences:\n\n::[[File:Morphological dependencies 2'.png|Morphological dependencies 2']]\n\nThe masculine subject ''le chien'' in (a) demands the masculine form of the predicative adjective ''blanc'', whereas the feminine subject ''la maison'' demands the feminine form of this adjective. A morphological dependency that is entirely independent of the syntactic dependencies therefore points again across the syntactic hierarchy.\n\nMorphological dependencies play an important role in [[Linguistic typology|typological studies]]. Languages are classified as mostly [[Head-marking language|head-marking]] (''Sam work-s'') or mostly [[Dependent-marking language|dependent-marking]] (''these houses''), whereby most if not all languages contain at least some minor measure of both head and dependent marking.<ref>The distinction between head- and dependent-marking was established by Nichols (1986). Nichols was using a dependency-based understanding of these distinctions.</ref>\n\n===Prosodic dependencies===\nProsodic dependencies are acknowledged in order to accommodate the behavior of [[clitic]]s.<ref>Concerning prosodic dependencies and the analysis of clitics, see Gro\u00df (2011).</ref> A clitic is a syntactically autonomous element that is prosodically dependent on a host. A clitic is therefore integrated into the prosody of its host, meaning that it forms a single word with its host. Prosodic dependencies exist entirely in the linear dimension (horizontal dimension), whereas standard syntactic dependencies exist in the hierarchical dimension (vertical dimension). Classic examples of clitics in English are reduced auxiliaries (e.g. ''-ll'', ''-s'', ''-ve'') and the possessive marker ''-s''. The prosodic dependencies in the following examples are indicated with the hyphen and the lack of a vertical projection line:\n\n[[File:Prosodic dependencies'.png|Prosodic dependencies']]\n\nThe hyphens and lack of projection lines indicate prosodic dependencies. A hyphen that appears on the left of the clitic indicates that the clitic is prosodically dependent on the word immediately to its left (''He'll'', ''There's''), whereas a hyphen that appears on the right side of the clitic (not shown here) indicates that the clitic is prosodically dependent on the word that appears immediately to its right. A given clitic is often prosodically dependent on its syntactic dependent (''He'll'', ''There's'') or on its head (''would've''). At other times, it can depend prosodically on a word that is neither its head nor its immediate dependent (''Florida's'').\n\n===Syntactic dependencies===\nSyntactic dependencies are the focus of most work in DG, as stated above. How the presence and the direction of syntactic dependencies are determined is of course often open to debate. In this regard, it must be acknowledged that the validity of syntactic dependencies in the trees throughout this article is being taken for granted. However, these hierarchies are such that many DGs can largely support them, although there will certainly be points of disagreement. The basic question about how syntactic dependencies are discerned has proven difficult to answer definitively. One should acknowledge in this area, however, that the basic task of identifying and discerning the presence and direction of the syntactic dependencies of DGs is no easier or harder than determining the constituent groupings of phrase structure grammars. A variety of heuristics are employed to this end, basic [[constituent (linguistics)|tests for constituents]] being useful tools; the syntactic dependencies assumed in the trees in this article are grouping words together in a manner that most closely matches the results of standard permutation, substitution, and ellipsis tests for constituents. Etymological considerations also provide helpful clues about the direction of dependencies. A promising principle upon which to base the existence of syntactic dependencies is distribution.<ref>Distribution is primary principle used by Owens (1984:36), Schubert (1988:40), and Mel\u02b9c\u0306uk (2003:200) for discerning syntactic dependencies.</ref> When one is striving to identify the root of a given phrase, the word that is most responsible for determining the distribution of that phrase as a whole is its root.\n\n==Linear order and discontinuities==\nTraditionally, DGs have had a different approach to linear order (word order) than phrase structure grammars. Dependency structures are minimal compared to their phrase structure counterparts, and these minimal structures allow one to focus intently on the two ordering dimensions.<ref>Concerning the importance of the two ordering dimensions, see Tesni\u00e8re (1959:16ff).</ref> Separating the vertical dimension (hierarchical order) from the horizontal dimension (linear order) is easily accomplished. This aspect of dependency structures has allowed DGs, starting with Tesni\u00e8re (1959), to focus on hierarchical order in a manner that is hardly possible for phrase structure grammars. For Tesni\u00e8re, linear order was secondary to hierarchical order insofar as hierarchical order preceded linear order in the mind of a speaker. The stemmas (trees) that Tesni\u00e8re produced reflected this view; they abstracted away from linear order to focus almost entirely on hierarchical order. Many DGs that followed Tesni\u00e8re adopted this practice, that is, they produced tree structures that reflect hierarchical order alone, e.g.\n\n::[[File:Dg-new-1.jpg|Two unordered trees]]\n\nThe traditional focus on hierarchical order generated the impression that DGs have little to say about linear order, and it has contributed to the view that DGs are particularly well-suited to examine languages with free word order. A negative result of this focus on hierarchical order, however, is that there is a dearth of DG explorations of particular word order phenomena, such as of standard [[Discontinuity (linguistics)|discontinuities]]. Comprehensive dependency grammar accounts of [[topicalization]], [[wh-movement|''wh''-fronting]], [[Scrambling (linguistics)|scrambling]], and [[extraposition]] are mostly absent from many established DG frameworks. This situation can be contrasted with phrase structure grammars, which have devoted tremendous effort to exploring these phenomena.\n\nThe nature of the dependency relation does not, however, prevent one from focusing on linear order. Dependency structures are as capable of exploring word order phenomena as phrase structures. The following trees illustrate this point; they represent one way of exploring discontinuities using dependency structures. The trees suggest the manner in which common discontinuities can be addressed. An example from German is used to illustrate a scrambling discontinuity:\n\n::[[File:Dg-new-2.jpg|8 ordered trees]]\n\nThe a-trees on the left show [[discontinuity (linguistics)|projectivity]] violations (= crossing lines), and the b-trees on the right demonstrate one means of addressing these violations. The displaced constituent takes on a word as its [[head (linguistics)|head]] that is not its [[government (linguistics)|governor]]. The words in red mark the [[Catena (linguistics)|catena]] (=chain) of words that extends from the root of the displaced constituent to the [[government (linguistics)|governor]] of that constituent.<ref>See Osborne et al. (2012) concerning catenae.</ref> Discontinuities are then explored in terms of these catenae. The limitations on topicalization, ''wh''-fronting, scrambling, and extraposition can be explored and identified by examining the nature of the catenae involved.\n\n==Syntactic functions==\nTraditionally, DGs have treated the syntactic functions (= grammatical functions, [[grammatical relation]]s) as primitive. They posit an inventory of functions (e.g. subject, object, oblique, determiner, attribute, predicative, etc.). These functions can appear as labels on the dependencies in the tree structures, e.g.<ref>For discussion and examples of the labels for syntactic functions that are attached to dependency edges and arcs, see for instance Mel'cuk (1988:22, 69) and van Valin (2001:102ff.).</ref>\n\n::[[File:Syntactic functions 1.png|Syntactic functions 1]]\n\nThe syntactic functions in this tree are shown in green: ATTR (attribute), COMP-P (complement of preposition), COMP-TO (complement of to), DET (determiner), P-ATTR (prepositional attribute), PRED (predicative), SUBJ (subject), TO-COMP (to complement). The functions chosen and abbreviations used in the tree here are merely representative of the general stance of DGs toward the syntactic functions. The actual inventory of functions and designations employed vary from DG to DG.\n\nAs a primitive of the theory, the status of these functions is much different than in some phrase structure grammars. Traditionally, phrase structure grammars derive the syntactic functions from the constellation. For instance, the object is identified as the NP appearing inside finite VP, and the subject as the NP appearing outside of finite VP. Since DGs reject the existence of a finite VP constituent, they were never presented with the option to view the syntactic functions in this manner. The issue is a question of what comes first: traditionally, DGs take the syntactic functions to be primitive and they then derive the constellation from these functions, whereas phrase structure grammars traditionally take the constellation to be primitive and they then derive the syntactic functions from the constellation.\n\nThis question about what comes first (the functions or the constellation) is not an inflexible matter. The stances of both grammar types (dependency and phrase structure) is not narrowly limited to the traditional views. Dependency and phrase structure are both fully compatible with both approaches to the syntactic functions. Indeed, monostratal systems, be they based dependency or phrase structure, will likely reject the notion that the functions are derived from the constellation or that the constellation is derived from the functions. They will take both to be primitive, which means neither can be derived from the other.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Catena (linguistics)|Catena]]\n*[[Constituent (linguistics)|Constituent]]\n*[[Dependency relation]] (in mathematics)\n*[[Discontinuity (linguistics)|Discontinuity]]\n*[[Finite verb]]\n*[[Head-directionality parameter]]\n*[[Igor Mel'\u010duk]]\n*[[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re]]\n*[[Phrase structure grammar]]\n*[[Predicate (grammar)|Predicate]]\n*[[Verb phrase]]\n*[[Universal Dependencies]]\n*[[Parse tree]]\n*[[Tree (data structure)]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*{{cite book|editor1-last=\u00c1gel |editor1-first=Vilmos |editor2-last=Eichinger |editor2-first=Ludwig M. |editor3-last=Eroms |editor3-first=Hans Werner |editor4-last=Hellwig |editor4-first=Peter |editor5-last=Heringer |editor5-first=Hans J\u00fcrgen |editor6-last=Lobin |editor6-first=Henning |title=Dependenz und Valenz:Ein internationales Handbuch der zeitgen\u00f6ssischen Forschung |trans-title=Dependency and Valency:An International Handbook of Contemporary Research |year=2003 |publisher=de Gruyter |location=Berlin |language=German |isbn=978-3110141900 |url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/serial/18595 |accessdate=24 August 2012}}\n*Coseriu, E. 1980.

The film's voice cast stars [[Anthony Gonzalez (actor)|Anthony Gonzalez]], [[Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal]], [[Benjamin Bratt]], [[Alanna Ubach]], [[Ren\u00e9e Victor]], [[Ana Ofelia Murgu\u00eda]] and [[Edward James Olmos]]. The story follows a 12-year-old boy named Miguel who is accidentally transported to the Land of the Dead, where he seeks the help of his deceased musician great-great-grandfather to return him to his family among the living and to reverse his family's ban on music.\n\nThe concept for ''Coco'' is inspired by the Mexican holiday [[Day of the Dead]]. The film was scripted by Molina and Matthew Aldrich from a story by Unkrich, Jason Katz, Aldrich and Molina. Pixar began developing the animation in 2016; Unkrich and some of the film's crew visited Mexico for research. Composer [[Michael Giacchino]], who had worked on prior Pixar animated features, composed the score. ''Coco'' is the first film with a nine-figure budget to feature an all-Latino principal cast, with a cost of $175{{nbsp}}million.\n\n''Coco'' premiered on October 20, 2017, during the [[Morelia International Film Festival]] in [[Morelia, Mexico]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://moreliafilmfest.com/en/coco-la-nueva-pelicula-de-disney%E2%80%A2pixar-abrira-el-15o-ficm/|title=''Coco'', the new Disney\u2022Pixar movie, will open the 15th FICM|date=July 21, 2017|publisher=Festival Internacional del Cine en Morelia|accessdate=November 6, 2017}}</ref> It was theatrically released in Mexico the following week, the weekend before {{lang|es|D\u00eda de los Muertos}}, and in the United States on November 22, 2017.

As of this note, there are 696 words. Also, keep the summary short please.-->\nIn Santa Cecilia, [[Mexico]], Miguel dreams of becoming a musician, even though his family strictly forbids it. His great-great-grandmother Imelda was married to a man who left her and their daughter Coco to pursue a career in music, and when he never returned, Imelda banished music from her family's life before starting a shoemaking business. Miguel now lives with the elderly Coco and their family, including Miguel's parents and grandmother, who are all shoemakers. He idolizes famous deceased musician Ernesto de la Cruz. Miguel made a makeshift guitar and he secretly teaches himself to play it from Ernesto's old films. On the Day of the Dead, Miguel accidentally damages the picture frame that holds a photo of Coco with her mother on the family {{lang|es|[[ofrenda]]}}, discovering that a hidden section of the photograph shows his great-great-grandfather holding Ernesto's famous guitar. Though the image's face has been torn off, Miguel concludes that Ernesto is his great-great-grandfather. Ignoring his family's objections, he decides to enter a Day of the Dead talent show.\n\nBreaking into Ernesto's mausoleum, Miguel takes his guitar to use in the show, but once he strums it, he becomes invisible to everyone in the village plaza. However, he can interact with his [[calaca|skeletal]] dead relatives, who are visiting from the Land of the Dead for the holiday. Taking him back with them, they learn that Imelda cannot visit, since Miguel accidentally removed her photo from the {{lang|es|ofrenda}}. Miguel discovers that he is cursed for stealing from the dead, and must return to the Land of the Living before sunrise, or he will become one of the dead; to do so, he must receive a blessing from a member of his family. Imelda offers Miguel a blessing on the condition he end his dream of becoming a musician, but Miguel refuses and resolves to seek Ernesto's blessing instead. He meets H\u00e9ctor, who declares that he knows Ernesto, offering to help him reach him in return for Miguel taking his photo back with him, so that he might visit his daughter before she forgets him, causing him to disappear completely. H\u00e9ctor helps Miguel enter a talent competition to win entry to Ernesto's mansion, but Miguel's family tracks him down, forcing him to flee. Miguel sneaks into the mansion, where Ernesto welcomes him as his descendant, but H\u00e9ctor confronts them, again imploring Miguel to take his photo to the Land of the Living. Ernesto and H\u00e9ctor renew an argument from their partnership in life, and Miguel realizes that when H\u00e9ctor decided to leave the duo to return to his family, Ernesto poisoned him and stole his guitar and songs, passing them off as his own to become famous. To protect his legacy, Ernesto seizes the photo and has his security guards throw Miguel and H\u00e9ctor into a [[cenote]] pit. There, Miguel realizes that H\u00e9ctor is his real great-great-grandfather, and that Coco is H\u00e9ctor's daughter. \n\nAfter Imelda and the family rescue the duo, Miguel reveals the truth about H\u00e9ctor's death. Imelda and H\u00e9ctor reconcile, and the family infiltrates Ernesto's concert to retrieve H\u00e9ctor's photo. Ernesto's crimes are exposed to the audience, who jeer at him as he is thrown out of the stadium, then crushed by a giant bell (the same way he died); in the chaos, however, H\u00e9ctor's photograph is lost. As the sun rises, Coco's life and memory are fading; Imelda and H\u00e9ctor bless Miguel, so that he can return to the Land of the Living. After Miguel plays \"[[Remember Me (Pixar song)|Remember Me]]\" (a song that H\u00e9ctor wrote for Coco, that Ernesto uses as his number one hit), Coco brightens and sings along with Miguel. She reveals that she had saved the torn-off piece of the family photo with H\u00e9ctor's face on it, then tells her family stories about her father, thus saving his memory as well as his existence in the Land of the Dead. Miguel's family reconciles with him, ending the ban on music; one year later, Miguel presents the family {{lang|es|ofrenda}} (which now includes the deceased Coco) to his new baby sister. Coco's collected letters from H\u00e9ctor prove that Ernesto stole his songs, destroying Ernesto's legacy and allowing H\u00e9ctor to be rightfully honored in his place. In the Land of the Dead, H\u00e9ctor and Imelda rekindle their romance and join Coco for a visit to the living, where Miguel plays and sings for his living and dead relatives.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=}}\n* [[Anthony Gonzalez (actor)|Anthony Gonzalez]] as Miguel, a 12-year-old aspiring musician.<ref name=VFMexicoAgeTrump /><ref name=\"AMCharacterFamily\">{{cite news|last1=Milligan|first1=Mercedes|title=Disney-Pixar Introduces the 'Coco' Character Family|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/features/disney-pixar-introduces-the-coco-character-family/|language=English|accessdate= June 8, 2017|work=Animation Magazine|date=June 6, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal]] as H\u00e9ctor, a charming [[trickster]] in the Land of the Dead who enlists Miguel to help him visit the Land of the Living.

Color was one: \"Given the holiday and the iconography, [Pixar] knew the Land of the Dead had to be a visually vibrant and colorful place, so [they] deliberately designed Santa Cecilia to be more muted\" said Unkrich.<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n\nAccording to Harley Jessup, the film's production designer, Santa Cecilia is based on real Mexican villages, as the production team \"stayed grounded in reality in the Land of the Living\". Chris Bernardi, the film's set supervisor, said that the town was made small so Miguel could feel confined. Bert Berry, the film's art director, said that aged building materials were used in order to depict Santa Cecilia \"as an older charming city\".<ref name=\"PressKit\"/> According to Unkrich, Miguel's guitar playing is authentic, as they \"videotaped musicians playing each song or melody and strapped GoPros on their guitars\" to use as a reference. For the scene in which Miguel plays music in his secret hideout, the filmmakers used \"very elegant, lyrical camera moves\" and \"gentle drifts and slow arcing moves around Miguel as he plays his guitar with very shallow depth of \ufb01eld to enhance the beauty of the soft-focus foreground candles\".<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n\nChristian Hoffman, the film's character supervisor, said that all of the details in Mama Coco's face were not modeled. Instead, his team used special software to design separate layers of detail, which were then added to her face with a shader. The character's model was made with higher resolution to get all the wrinkles right, according to Hoffman.<ref name=\"PressKit\"/> Pixar used some Xolo dogs to use as reference for the character Dante, while a tentacle from ''[[Finding Dory]]'''s Hank was used for his tongue.\n\nJessup called the Marigold petal bridge that connects both worlds \"elegant and magical\". Michael K. O'Brien, the film's effects supervisor, called it \"a huge technical challenge\" for the animation team, but referred to it as something \"so visually exciting with petals dripping from it; it was a massive artistic undertaking. [the production team] wanted it to glow \u2014 to feel alive\". The scenes in which Miguel takes a few petals off of the bridge and in which Hector sinks into the bridge were given more effects and special art direction.<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n\nFor the Land of the Dead, Unkrich did not want \"to have just a free-for-all, wacky world\", wanting instead to add logic and be \"ever-expanding because  new residents would arrive regularly\". Jessup said that the animation team wanted the Land of the Dead \"to be a vibrant explosion of color\" when Miguel arrives. Jessup also said that \"Lee [Unkrich] described a vertical world of towers, contrasting with the flatness of Santa Cecilia. The lights and reflections are dazzling and there's a crazy transportation system that connects it all. The costume colors are much more vibrant than in the Land of the Living, where [the animation team] tried to stay grounded in reality. [They] really went all out in the Land of the Dead to make it a reflection of the holiday\". According to David Ryu, the film's supervising technical director, the animation team \"\ufb01gured out a way to introduce a single light \u2014 but give it a million points\" for the scenes on the outside in the Land of the Dead: \"The renderer sees it as one light, but we see a million lights\".<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n\nAccording to art director Daniel Arraiga, the animators \"had to \ufb01gure out how to give [the skeletons] personality without skin, muscles, noses or even lips\" and that they \"played with shapes and did a lot of paintings. [They] sculpted and studied skulls from every angle to \ufb01gure out where [they] could add appeal and charm\". Global technology supervisor J.D. Northrup was hired early in the film's production in order to avoid potential issues in the film's animation process. Northrup said that \"Each [of the skeletons' pieces] had to be independent so the complexity of the rig and the stress that it puts on the pipeline were something like we've never seen before.\" Northrup was also tasked with simplifying the skeleton's elements to render the skeleton crowds. In order to create the skeletons, several additional controls were used, as they \"needed to move in ways that humans don't,\" according to character modeling and articulation lead Michael Honse. Honse said that the bones were a particular problem, stating that \"there was a lot of back-and-forth with animation to get it right,\" but found \"really cool ways\" to move the skeletons.<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n\n===Music and soundtrack===\n{{Infobox album\n| name         = Coco (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n| type         = Soundtrack\n| artist       = Various Artists\n| cover        = \n| alt          = \n| released     = {{Start date|2017|11|10}}\n| recorded     = August\u2013October 2017\n| venue        = \n| studio       = {{flat list|*[[Warner Bros.

Based on an original idea by [[Lee Unkrich]], it is directed by him and co-directed by [[Adrian Molina]]. The film's voice cast stars [[Anthony Gonzalez (actor)|Anthony Gonzalez]], [[Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal]], [[Benjamin Bratt]], [[Alanna Ubach]], [[Ren\u00e9e Victor]], [[Ana Ofelia Murgu\u00eda]] and [[Edward James Olmos]]. The story follows a 12-year-old boy named Miguel who is accidentally transported to the Land of the Dead, where he seeks the help of his deceased musician great-great-grandfather to return him to his family among the living and to reverse his family's ban on music.\n\nThe concept for ''Coco'' is inspired by the Mexican holiday [[Day of the Dead]]. The film was scripted by Molina and Matthew Aldrich from a story by Unkrich, Jason Katz, Aldrich and Molina. Pixar began developing the animation in 2016; Unkrich and some of the film's crew visited Mexico for research. Composer [[Michael Giacchino]], who had worked on prior Pixar animated features, composed the score. ''Coco'' is the first film with a nine-figure budget to feature an all-Latino principal cast, with a cost of $175{{nbsp}}million.\n\n''Coco'' premiered on October 20, 2017, during the [[Morelia International Film Festival]] in [[Morelia, Mexico]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://moreliafilmfest.com/en/coco-la-nueva-pelicula-de-disney%E2%80%A2pixar-abrira-el-15o-ficm/|title=''Coco'', the new Disney\u2022Pixar movie, will open the 15th FICM|date=July 21, 2017|publisher=Festival Internacional del Cine en Morelia|accessdate=November 6, 2017}}</ref> It was theatrically released in Mexico the following week, the weekend before {{lang|es|D\u00eda de los Muertos}}, and in the United States on November 22, 2017.

His great-great-grandmother Imelda was married to a man who left her and their daughter Coco to pursue a career in music, and when he never returned, Imelda banished music from her family's life before starting a shoemaking business. Miguel now lives with the elderly Coco and their family, including Miguel's parents and grandmother, who are all shoemakers. He idolizes famous deceased musician Ernesto de la Cruz. Miguel made a makeshift guitar and he secretly teaches himself to play it from Ernesto's old films. On the Day of the Dead, Miguel accidentally damages the picture frame that holds a photo of Coco with her mother on the family {{lang|es|[[ofrenda]]}}, discovering that a hidden section of the photograph shows his great-great-grandfather holding Ernesto's famous guitar. Though the image's face has been torn off, Miguel concludes that Ernesto is his great-great-grandfather. Ignoring his family's objections, he decides to enter a Day of the Dead talent show.\n\nBreaking into Ernesto's mausoleum, Miguel takes his guitar to use in the show, but once he strums it, he becomes invisible to everyone in the village plaza. However, he can interact with his [[calaca|skeletal]] dead relatives, who are visiting from the Land of the Dead for the holiday. Taking him back with them, they learn that Imelda cannot visit, since Miguel accidentally removed her photo from the {{lang|es|ofrenda}}. Miguel discovers that he is cursed for stealing from the dead, and must return to the Land of the Living before sunrise, or he will become one of the dead; to do so, he must receive a blessing from a member of his family. Imelda offers Miguel a blessing on the condition he end his dream of becoming a musician, but Miguel refuses and resolves to seek Ernesto's blessing instead. He meets H\u00e9ctor, who declares that he knows Ernesto, offering to help him reach him in return for Miguel taking his photo back with him, so that he might visit his daughter before she forgets him, causing him to disappear completely. H\u00e9ctor helps Miguel enter a talent competition to win entry to Ernesto's mansion, but Miguel's family tracks him down, forcing him to flee. Miguel sneaks into the mansion, where Ernesto welcomes him as his descendant, but H\u00e9ctor confronts them, again imploring Miguel to take his photo to the Land of the Living. Ernesto and H\u00e9ctor renew an argument from their partnership in life, and Miguel realizes that when H\u00e9ctor decided to leave the duo to return to his family, Ernesto poisoned him and stole his guitar and songs, passing them off as his own to become famous. To protect his legacy, Ernesto seizes the photo and has his security guards throw Miguel and H\u00e9ctor into a [[cenote]] pit. There, Miguel realizes that H\u00e9ctor is his real great-great-grandfather, and that Coco is H\u00e9ctor's daughter. \n\nAfter Imelda and the family rescue the duo, Miguel reveals the truth about H\u00e9ctor's death. Imelda and H\u00e9ctor reconcile, and the family infiltrates Ernesto's concert to retrieve H\u00e9ctor's photo. Ernesto's crimes are exposed to the audience, who jeer at him as he is thrown out of the stadium, then crushed by a giant bell (the same way he died); in the chaos, however, H\u00e9ctor's photograph is lost. As the sun rises, Coco's life and memory are fading; Imelda and H\u00e9ctor bless Miguel, so that he can return to the Land of the Living. After Miguel plays \"[[Remember Me (Pixar song)|Remember Me]]\" (a song that H\u00e9ctor wrote for Coco, that Ernesto uses as his number one hit), Coco brightens and sings along with Miguel. She reveals that she had saved the torn-off piece of the family photo with H\u00e9ctor's face on it, then tells her family stories about her father, thus saving his memory as well as his existence in the Land of the Dead. Miguel's family reconciles with him, ending the ban on music; one year later, Miguel presents the family {{lang|es|ofrenda}} (which now includes the deceased Coco) to his new baby sister. Coco's collected letters from H\u00e9ctor prove that Ernesto stole his songs, destroying Ernesto's legacy and allowing H\u00e9ctor to be rightfully honored in his place. In the Land of the Dead, H\u00e9ctor and Imelda rekindle their romance and join Coco for a visit to the living, where Miguel plays and sings for his living and dead relatives.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=}}\n* [[Anthony Gonzalez (actor)|Anthony Gonzalez]] as Miguel, a 12-year-old aspiring musician.<ref name=VFMexicoAgeTrump /><ref name=\"AMCharacterFamily\">{{cite news|last1=Milligan|first1=Mercedes|title=Disney-Pixar Introduces the 'Coco' Character Family|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/features/disney-pixar-introduces-the-coco-character-family/|language=English|accessdate= June 8, 2017|work=Animation Magazine|date=June 6, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal]] as H\u00e9ctor, a charming [[trickster]] in the Land of the Dead who enlists Miguel to help him visit the Land of the Living.

In one version of the story, his family is cursed with singing when trying to speak, which was included as a technique to add music to a story where music is banned. Originally, Lopez and Anderson-Lopez had written many more songs for the film than what ended up in the released version; one piece that survived in storyboard until late into the production was an expository song that explained the Mexican holiday to viewers to begin the film. In another song, Miguel's mother explains the tradition of shoe-making in their family, and how this means he is not allowed to pursue music.<ref>{{Citation|title=Coco: Deleted Scenes with commentary|date=2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qurIuw_LCgc|volume=|pages=|publisher=Pixar Animation Studios|access-date=2018-06-22}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n''Coco'' is the first-ever motion picture with a nine-figure budget to feature an all-Latino cast, with a cost of $175\u2013200{{nbsp}}million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhregister.com/news/article/Pixar-s-Coco-feasts-on-Justice-12384697.php|title=Pixar's 'Coco' feasts on 'Justice League' at box office|date=November 26, 2017|publisher=[[New Haven Register]]|accessdate=November 27, 2017}}</ref> Gonzalez first auditioned for the role of Miguel when he was nine, and was finalized in the role two years later.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2017/11/24/meet-anthony-gonzalez-teen-breakout-star-pixars-animated-coco/885828001/|title=Meet Anthony Gonzalez, the teen breakout star of Pixar's animated 'Coco'|website=Usatoday.com}}</ref> Speaking of his character, Gonzalez said: \"[Miguel and I] both know the importance of following our dream and we know the importance of following our tradition, so that's something that I connected with Miguel a lot\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/redeye/culture/ct-redeye-coco-movie-actor-anthony-gonzalez-interview-20180223-story.html|title='Coco' star Anthony Gonzalez connects his passion for music with his love for family|first=Sad\u00e9|last=Carpenter|website=Chicagotribune.com}}</ref> During the film's pre-production, Miguel was originally set to be voiced by a child named Emilio Fuentes, but was removed from the role after his voice deepened due to puberty over the course of the film's production.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/coco-how-pixar-brought-day-dead-story-life-1065932|title='Coco': How Pixar Brought Its \"Day of the Dead\" Story to Life|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, the ''Coco'' team made an official announcement about the cast, which revealed that Gael Garcia Bernal, Benjamin Bratt, Ren\u00e9e Victor, and Anthony Gonzalez would voice the characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/12/pixar-coco-gael-garcia-bernal-dia-de-los-muertos-miguel|title=Pixar's Coco Is a \"Love Letter to Mexico\" When It's Needed Most|first=Joanna|last=Robinson|website=Vanityfair.com}}</ref> Bratt, who voiced De la Cruz, was \"moved\" when he realized that Disney-Pixar wanted to make a film on Latin culture.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/gael-garc-a-bernal-talks-singing-pixars-coco-1056611|title=Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal Talks About Singing in Pixar's 'Coco'|website=Hollywoodreporter.com|accessdate=May 26, 2018}}</ref> Disney officials closely monitored Bernal's movements and expressions while he voiced the characters and used their input for animating H\u00e9ctor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/coco-interview-gael-garcia-bernal/|title=Coco Was A 'Collaborative Process' At Pixar|date=November 21, 2017|website=Screenrant.com|accessdate=May 26, 2018}}</ref>\n\nBratt voiced Ernesto De la Cruz, a character who he described as \"the Mexican Frank Sinatra\"; \"[a] larger than life persona\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/coco-interview-benjamin-bratt-anthony-gonzalez/|title=Benjamin Bratt Is Mexican Sinatra In Coco|date=November 21, 2017|publisher=}}</ref> On the advice of the filmmakers, Bratt watched videos of equivalent Mexican actors including [[Jorge Negrete]] and [[Pedro Infante]].

Color was one: \"Given the holiday and the iconography, [Pixar] knew the Land of the Dead had to be a visually vibrant and colorful place, so [they] deliberately designed Santa Cecilia to be more muted\" said Unkrich.<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n\nAccording to Harley Jessup, the film's production designer, Santa Cecilia is based on real Mexican villages, as the production team \"stayed grounded in reality in the Land of the Living\". Chris Bernardi, the film's set supervisor, said that the town was made small so Miguel could feel confined. Bert Berry, the film's art director, said that aged building materials were used in order to depict Santa Cecilia \"as an older charming city\".<ref name=\"PressKit\"/> According to Unkrich, Miguel's guitar playing is authentic, as they \"videotaped musicians playing each song or melody and strapped GoPros on their guitars\" to use as a reference. For the scene in which Miguel plays music in his secret hideout, the filmmakers used \"very elegant, lyrical camera moves\" and \"gentle drifts and slow arcing moves around Miguel as he plays his guitar with very shallow depth of \ufb01eld to enhance the beauty of the soft-focus foreground candles\".<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n\nChristian Hoffman, the film's character supervisor, said that all of the details in Mama Coco's face were not modeled. Instead, his team used special software to design separate layers of detail, which were then added to her face with a shader. The character's model was made with higher resolution to get all the wrinkles right, according to Hoffman.<ref name=\"PressKit\"/> Pixar used some Xolo dogs to use as reference for the character Dante, while a tentacle from ''[[Finding Dory]]'''s Hank was used for his tongue.\n\nJessup called the Marigold petal bridge that connects both worlds \"elegant and magical\". Michael K. O'Brien, the film's effects supervisor, called it \"a huge technical challenge\" for the animation team, but referred to it as something \"so visually exciting with petals dripping from it; it was a massive artistic undertaking. [the production team] wanted it to glow \u2014 to feel alive\". The scenes in which Miguel takes a few petals off of the bridge and in which Hector sinks into the bridge were given more effects and special art direction.<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n\nFor the Land of the Dead, Unkrich did not want \"to have just a free-for-all, wacky world\", wanting instead to add logic and be \"ever-expanding because  new residents would arrive regularly\". Jessup said that the animation team wanted the Land of the Dead \"to be a vibrant explosion of color\" when Miguel arrives. Jessup also said that \"Lee [Unkrich] described a vertical world of towers, contrasting with the flatness of Santa Cecilia. The lights and reflections are dazzling and there's a crazy transportation system that connects it all. The costume colors are much more vibrant than in the Land of the Living, where [the animation team] tried to stay grounded in reality. [They] really went all out in the Land of the Dead to make it a reflection of the holiday\". According to David Ryu, the film's supervising technical director, the animation team \"\ufb01gured out a way to introduce a single light \u2014 but give it a million points\" for the scenes on the outside in the Land of the Dead: \"The renderer sees it as one light, but we see a million lights\".<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n\nAccording to art director Daniel Arraiga, the animators \"had to \ufb01gure out how to give [the skeletons] personality without skin, muscles, noses or even lips\" and that they \"played with shapes and did a lot of paintings. [They] sculpted and studied skulls from every angle to \ufb01gure out where [they] could add appeal and charm\". Global technology supervisor J.D. Northrup was hired early in the film's production in order to avoid potential issues in the film's animation process. Northrup said that \"Each [of the skeletons' pieces] had to be independent so the complexity of the rig and the stress that it puts on the pipeline were something like we've never seen before.\" Northrup was also tasked with simplifying the skeleton's elements to render the skeleton crowds. In order to create the skeletons, several additional controls were used, as they \"needed to move in ways that humans don't,\" according to character modeling and articulation lead Michael Honse. Honse said that the bones were a particular problem, stating that \"there was a lot of back-and-forth with animation to get it right,\" but found \"really cool ways\" to move the skeletons.<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n\n===Music and soundtrack===\n{{Infobox album\n| name         = Coco (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n| type         = Soundtrack\n| artist       = Various Artists\n| cover        = \n| alt          = \n| released     = {{Start date|2017|11|10}}\n| recorded     = August\u2013October 2017\n| venue        = \n| studio       = {{flat list|*[[Warner Bros.

As a producer, he has produced albums by [[Virginia Wolf]], [[Jimmy Nail]], and [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]].\n\nIn addition to his drum work, Taylor is well known for his [[falsetto]] vocal range. He sometimes played keyboards, guitars and bass on his own songs. During the 1980s, in addition to his work with Queen, he formed a parallel band known as [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], in which he was the lead singer and rhythm guitarist. During the early 1980s, Taylor was also a panellist on the popular UK quiz show ''[[Pop Quiz]]'', hosted by [[Mike Read]]. In 2014, he appeared in ''[[The Life of Rock with Brian Pern]]'' as himself.\n\n== Early life ==\nRoger Taylor was born on 26 July 1949 at West Norfolk & Lynn Hospital in [[King's Lynn]], [[Norfolk]]. The new maternity ward was opened by Princess Elizabeth (the future queen, [[Elizabeth II]]), where she was introduced to 16 new mothers including Winifred Taylor, his mother. Taylor first lived at 87 High Street in King's Lynn, and later moved to Beulah Street in the town. Taylor's first school was Rosebury Avenue school.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Trevor|first1=Heaton|title=Rock Star's Norfolk Childhood|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Roger_Taylor_-_03-20-1999_-_Eastern_Daily_Press_-_Rock_Star%27s_Norfolk_Childhood|website=Queen Archives|publisher=Eastern Daily Press}}</ref> Taylor moved to [[Truro]], [[Cornwall]], south west England, with his mother Winifred, father Michael and younger sister Clare. When he was seven years old, he and some friends formed his first band, the Bubblingover Boys, in which he played the [[ukulele]]. He briefly attended [[Truro Cathedral School]]; at the age of 13, he joined [[Truro School]] as a day boy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://themarchoftheblackqueen.piczo.com/?g=57322673&cr=6|title=Roger|publisher=themarchoftheblackqueen.piczo.com|accessdate=8 April 2012}}</ref> At the age of 15, Taylor became a member of the Reaction, a semi-professional rock band formed mainly of boys from Truro School. Taylor had originally learned guitar, but became a drummer when he realised he had a more natural aptitude for it. Taylor taught himself to tune his drums, inspired by [[Keith Moon]] of [[the Who]] because of the \"great drums sounds\" on the early Who records.<ref name=\"Roger Taylor Interview\">{{cite web | url= http://www.queenzone.com/articles/roger-taylor-interview.aspx | title= Roger Taylor Interview | publisher= Queen Zone | accessdate= 10 August 2015 | url-status=dead | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150715215326/http://www.queenzone.com/articles/roger-taylor-interview.aspx | archivedate= 15 July 2015 | df= dmy-all }}</ref> Another key influence on Taylor was drummer [[Mitch Mitchell]] of [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]], who Taylor stated was his early role model.<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\">{{cite web | url= http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/interviews/roger-taylor-1/drum-master-class/ | title= Roger's Drum Master Class (Music Works - BBC World Service, November 28, 1993) | publisher=Queen Online | accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1967, Taylor went to London to study dentistry at the [[Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry|London Hospital Medical College]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/members/roger-taylor/|title=Roger Taylor |website=Queen official website|access-date=15 January 2017}}</ref> but he became bored with dentistry.

Smile included May on lead guitar, Staffell on lead vocals and bass, and later Taylor on drums. The band lasted for two years before Staffell departed to join [[Humpy Bong]], leaving the band with a catalogue of nine songs.\n\nSmile reunited for several songs on 22 December 1992. Taylor's band [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]] were headliners and he brought May and Staffell on to play \"Earth\" and \"If I Were a Carpenter\".<ref>[http://www.queenzone.com/queenzone/article_show.aspx?Q=11]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208151834/http://www.queenzone.com/queenzone/article_show.aspx?Q=11 |date=8 February 2007 }}</ref>\n\n=== 1970s\u2013present: Queen ===\n{{Main|Queen (band)}}\n[[Image:Hannover7907.jpg|thumb|right|Taylor performing with [[Queen (band)|Queen]] in 1979.]]\n\nIn 1969, Taylor was working with [[Freddie Mercury]] at the Kensington Market (they were sharing a flat at around the same time). Mercury, then known as Freddie Bulsara, was an avid fan of Smile. The band split up in 1970. In the same year, Taylor turned down the chance to become drummer for [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], which led to [[Phil Collins]] joining instead.<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/8784298/Queen-40th-anniversary-10-things-you-never-knew.html | title= Queen 40th anniversary: 10 things you never knew | work=The Daily Telegraph | date=24 September 2011 | accessdate=27 August 2015}}</ref> Bulsara convinced the remaining two members of Smile to continue and he eventually joined the band, which he renamed Queen. In 1971, they recruited bass guitarist [[John Deacon]], before going on to release their [[Queen (Queen album)|self-titled debut album]] in 1973. Taylor is the third most credited songwriter for the band, usually contributing one or two tracks per album.\n\n===1977\u2013present: Solo career===\nTaylor has had a productive solo career, releasing five albums. His first single was his 1977 \"I Wanna Testify\". He recorded it during Queen's sessions for the ''[[News of the World (album)|News of the World]]'' album. The A-side, although a cover of the Parliaments song of the same name, was completely different from the original. The B-side was a self-penned song \"Turn on the TV\".\n\nTaylor's first solo album, ''[[Fun in Space]]'', was released in 1981. Taylor performed all vocals and played all instruments aside of about half of the keyboards, which were done by engineer [[David Richards (record producer)|David Richards]]. With Queen still touring heavily and recording at the time of release, Taylor was unable to promote the album to its fullest extent, so he appeared on some European TV shows to promote the single, \"Future Management\", including ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. The only other single to come from the album was \"My Country\". The only US single released from the album was \"Let's Get Crazy\".\n\nTaylor's next venture, ''[[Strange Frontier]]'', came in June 1984. The three singles from the album were the title track, \"Beautiful Dreams\" (in Portugal only) and \"Man on Fire\", the latter becoming a live favourite for him in later years. No attempts to promote the singles were made since Queen toured to promote ''[[The Works (Queen album)|The Works]]'', and Taylor did not perform on any TV shows. ''Strange Frontier'' included guest appearances by bandmates Freddie Mercury, Brian May and John Deacon. Mercury sang backing vocals on \"Killing Time\", Deacon remixed the B-side \"I Cry For You\" and [[Rick Parfitt]] co-wrote and played on \"It's An Illusion\". David Richards, Queen's engineer and producer at the time, also co-wrote two of the tracks. The album includes covers of [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s \"[[Racing in the Street]]\" and [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[Masters of War]]\".\n\nIn 1986, Taylor co-produced ''[[Vigilante (Magnum album)|Vigilante]]'', the sixth studio album by rock band [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Patrick Lemieux | author2=Adam Unger |title=The Queen Chronology: The Recording & Release History of the Band|year=2013|page=54|publisher=Across the Board Books|isbn=978-0991984046}}</ref>\n\nAfter Queen finished their 1986 [[A Kind of Magic|Magic Tour]], Taylor started a new band, [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], which released three albums over their six years of existence. In 1993, the band split up, after performing one final gig at the [[Wickham Festival#History|Gosport Festival]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/roger-taylor-21213223|title=Roger Taylor|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Taylor worked with [[Yoshiki (musician)|Yoshiki]], drummer and pianist of [[X Japan]] and released the song \"Foreign Sand\" and a reworking of the Cross's \"Final Destination\". The album ''Happiness?'' was \"Dedicated to the tasmanian tiger \u2013 thylacinus cynocephalus, but most especially... for Freddie\". \"Nazis 1994\" from this album became Taylor's first hit single in England and was followed by two other top 40 UK hits, \"Happiness\" and \"Foreign Sand\".\n\nIn 1998, Taylor released his fourth solo album ''[[Electric Fire]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gZIjT8PgJMEC&pg=PA499&lpg=PA499&dq=In+1998,+Taylor+released+his+fourth+solo+album+Electric+Fire.&source=bl&ots=XBU0kDQe4_&sig=BBO6TCasZB87g_GSrP6vLq5xblE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwinuvqOrMvZAhVBmBQKHZAEB34Q6AEIajAI#v=onepage&q=In%201998,%20Taylor%20released%20his%20fourth%20solo%20album%20Electric%20Fire.&f=false|title=The International Who's Who in Popular Music 2002|last=Gregory|first=Andy|date=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9781857431612|language=en}}</ref> He supported it with a small tour in the spring of 1999, on which Brian May joined him at the gig in Wolverhampton. Taylor also performed one of the first Internet-gigs \u2013 for which he got a mention in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]].<ref>[http://www.queencollector.com/Articles/Solo10/roger.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930042840/http://www.queencollector.com/Articles/Solo10/roger.html |date=30 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, after nearly twelve years between solo albums, Taylor planned to release a new studio album titled ''[[The Unblinking Eye (Everything Is Broken)|The Unblinking Eye]]''. The first single, of the same name, was released on 23 November 2009 as a digital download, but due to popular demand it was released as a limited edition single.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenonline.com/news/1517/|title=QueenOnline \u2013 News |date=17 November 2009 |accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref> Originally leaked to the official Queen fan club's website for members only, it still managed to be on YouTube within hours of the early bird release. It was announced in late 2012 that fans would be able to vote on which songs appeared on the new album, with the album itself slated for release that year.\n\nThe album is called ''[[Fun on Earth]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planetrock.com/news/rock-news/roger-taylor-to-release-solo-album/ |title=Roger Taylor To Release Solo Album &#124; Rock News &#124; News |publisher=Planet Rock |date=22 November 2012 |accessdate=27 June 2013}}</ref> and was released on 11 November 2013.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6296827/queen-roger-taylor-solo-record-adam-lambert|title=Queen's Roger Taylor Talks Solo Work, Hopes Band Will Record With Adam Lambert|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref>\n\n=== The Cross ===\n{{Main|The Cross (band)}}\n\nThe Cross were a side project of Taylor's that existed from 1987 to 1993 and released three albums. While still the drummer for Queen, Taylor fronted the Cross as rhythm guitarist and lead vocalist. On its debut release, ''The Cross'' incorporated dance influences which they dropped on their remaining two albums. The band never enjoyed much commercial success, except in Germany.\n\n=== ''Shove It'' ===\n[[Image:The Cross 1990 Neu Isenburg 1.jpg|thumb|Taylor performing with [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]] in 1990]]\n\nAfter Queen's 1986 Magic Tour, the band members went their separate ways to do various solo work. Taylor decided to form a new band with whom he could tour. He had already written and recorded the album himself before finding a band to play the songs with. He eventually placed an ad for band members in a national newspaper, hinting he was a famous rock musician. The position of keyboard player was duly offered to [[Spike Edney]] after two successful Queen tours in which Edney had played. When the auditions were over, the line-up was completed by Peter Noone on bass, Clayton Moss on guitar and [[Josh Macrae]] on drums. Taylor himself would take the responsibility on lead vocals and rhythm guitar.\n\nThe first album, ''Shove It'', was released in 1988.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Cross-Shove-It/release/6351445|title=The Cross (3) - Shove It|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/shove-it-mw0000651910|title=Shove It - Cross {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref> In Europe, '[[Heaven for Everyone]]\" (later a Queen song) contained Freddie Mercury on lead vocals and Taylor on backing vocals. However, on the single version and American album version the roles were switched. The European CD contained an extra track (compared to cassette and LP) in the 2nd Shelf Mix, the US version having \"Feel the Force\" as its extra track. The band promoted hard (especially in Germany), with many TV performances of singles including an appearance at the Montreux Golden Rose festival in 1988. The tour took in dates in the UK and Germany. Three singles were released from the album: \"Cowboys and Indians\", \"Heaven for Everyone\" and \"Shove It\". Another single, \"Manipulator\", was released in 1988, but it was not included on any album. It was also the only song from the time that had joint writing credits, Taylor sharing them with Edney and Steve Strange.\n\n=== ''Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know'' ===\n[[Image:The Cross 1990 Neu Isenburg 2.jpg|thumb|Taylor performing with the Cross in 1990.]]\n\nAfter finishing Queen's 1989 album ''[[The Miracle (album)|The Miracle]]'', Taylor went into the studio with the rest of the Cross for the first time to record ''[[Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know (The Cross album)|Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know]]''. The band composed the opening track \"On Top of the World Ma\" with a riff bearing a resemblance to the [[Led Zeppelin]] track \"[[Whole Lotta Love]]\". The rest of the album consisted mainly of individually written songs, except for \"Power To Love\" which was the result of the combined effort of Macrae, Noone and Moss. Clayton Moss sang lead vocals on his own track \"Better Things\", and Spike Edney played [[mandolin]] on \"Final Destination\", which was written by Taylor. \"Final Destination\" was released as a single, as were \"Liar\" and \"Power To Love\", the latter being the last single to be released in the UK by the band. \"Final Destination\" came with a live rendition of Taylor's song \"Man on Fire\" as a B-side, and \"Liar\" (Noone) had a brand new track, \"In Charge of My Heart\", which was also penned by Taylor. The 12\" single and CD of \"Liar\" also included extended remixes of both \"Liar\" and \"In Charge of My Heart\". The instrumental section at the beginning of \"In Charge of My Heart\" was used as the opening to concerts on the accompanying tour. \"Closer To You\" (Edney) had been planned to be released in America, but never was. The group having seemingly given up on the UK market, the accompanying tour only included dates in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Ibiza. Unusual for such tours, every song from the new album was played live.\n\n=== ''Blue Rock'' ===\nMade at a time when Taylor's efforts were concentrated on Queen and Mercury himself, ''[[Blue Rock (album)|Blue Rock]]'' gave the other members of the band a chance to take control of the upcoming album. It was in fact mostly written by Edney, who contributed three of his own tracks and contributed to four more. Once again the opening track was penned by the entire band, \"Bad Attitude\" was written (although not complete) by the Christmas fan club party of 1990. The album itself contained a lot of vocals not from Taylor, but mainly of Edney and Noone. Examples of this can be heard in \"Put It All Down To Love\" (Edney), \"Life Changes\" (Moss, Noone, Edney and Macrae) and \"Heartland\" (The B-side to Life Changes, penned by Noone). Blue Rock itself was only released in Germany (although promo copies were released in Italy and Japan), so copies are somewhat rare. \"New Dark Ages\" (Taylor) was released in Germany with another live version of \"Man on Fire\", whilst \"Life Changes\" was released with the B-side \"Heartland\". It was however immediately withdrawn due to Mercury's death. The tour was in support of [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]], so the concert lengths were short (45 mins.) and very few bootlegs have survived. The tour pace was rapid, covering 20 dates in one month.\n\n=== Break-up of the Cross ===\nThe band broke up in 1993 after performing a final show. Taylor continued working with Queen and produced solo albums. Drummer Macrae accompanied Taylor on his solo tours and also played percussion at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert. Both Taylor and keyboardist Edney participated in the [[Queen + Paul Rodgers]] tours, while Macrae worked behind the scenes as co-producer, sound engineer and Pro Tools engineer for them. In the late 1990s, Edney formed the SAS Band (\"Spike's All Stars\"), a group with an ever-changing line-up of popular '80s musicians.\n\n=== 21st century ===\nTaylor has appeared along with May for various other events and promotions, including Queen's induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2001<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/queen |title=Queen: inducted in 2001 &#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |publisher=Rockhall.com |date=15 April 2013 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}</ref> and the \"[[Party at the Palace]]\" in 2002, celebrating the golden jubilee of [[Queen Elizabeth II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenvault.com/patp.html |title=Party at the Palace |publisher=QueenVault.com |date=3 June 2002 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}</ref> In 2004, Taylor, May, and Mike Dixon received the [[Helpmann Award]] for Best Music Direction for the musical [[We Will Rock You (musical)|''We Will Rock You'']].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.helpmannawards.com.au/2004/past-nominees-and-winners/industry-awards|title=Past nominees and winners Helpmann Awards|accessdate=16 December 2016}}</ref>  At [[Live Earth]] in 2007, Taylor opened the concert with [[Taylor Hawkins]] of [[Foo Fighters]] and [[Chad Smith]] of [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]].\n\nTaylor and May, performing as Queen, also appeared three times on the American singing contest television show ''[[American Idol]]''. The first appearance was on 11 April 2006, during which that week's contestants were required to sing a Queen song. Songs performed included \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\", \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\", \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\", and \"[[Innuendo (song)|Innuendo]]\".

He said: \"I still think listening to Mitch Mitchell, especially the early stuff with Hendrix, is just fantastic. This fusion of jazz technique and wonderful riffs but with this rolling ferocious attack on the whole kit, it had lots of jazz influences I think. In fact for me he played the kit like a song, it was just wonderful. Total integration into the song. Not just marking time\".<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\"/>\n\nTaylor has also expressed great admiration for [[John Bonham]] of [[Led Zeppelin]]. Speaking of Bonham, Taylor said, \"The greatest rock and roll drummer of all time was John Bonham, who did things that nobody had ever even thought possible before with the drum kit. And also the greatest sound out of his drums \u2013 they sounded enormous, and just one bass drum. So fast on it that he did more with one bass drum than most people could do with three, if they could manage them. And he had technique to burn and fantastic power and tremendous feel for rock and roll\".<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\"/> However, for just sheer technique, Taylor described the jazz and [[big band]] drummer [[Buddy Rich]] as \"the best I've ever seen\".<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\"/>\n\nSpeaking to ''[[Modern Drummer]]'' in 1984, Taylor also described [[Keith Moon]], the drummer of [[the Who]], as \"absolutely brilliant...he had a total unique style; he didn't owe anyone anything.\"<ref name=\"Roger Taylor Interview\"/>\n\n== Tributes ==\nIn 2013, a newly-discovered species of the genus ''[[Heteragrion]]'' (Odonata : Zygoptera) from Brazil was named ''Heteragrion rogertaylori'' after Taylor, in honour of his \"powerful sound, wonderful lyrics and raspy voice \"{{spaced ndash}}one of four ''Heteragrion'' flatwing [[Damselfly|damselflies]] named after the bandmates, paying tribute to the 40th anniversary of Queen's founding.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2013/f/z03685p080f.pdf|title = Diagnoses and discussion of the group 1 and 2 Brazilian species of Heteragrion, with descriptions of four new species (Odonata: Megapodagrionidae).

As a producer, he has produced albums by [[Virginia Wolf]], [[Jimmy Nail]], and [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]].\n\nIn addition to his drum work, Taylor is well known for his [[falsetto]] vocal range. He sometimes played keyboards, guitars and bass on his own songs. During the 1980s, in addition to his work with Queen, he formed a parallel band known as [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], in which he was the lead singer and rhythm guitarist. During the early 1980s, Taylor was also a panellist on the popular UK quiz show ''[[Pop Quiz]]'', hosted by [[Mike Read]]. In 2014, he appeared in ''[[The Life of Rock with Brian Pern]]'' as himself.\n\n== Early life ==\nRoger Taylor was born on 26 July 1949 at West Norfolk & Lynn Hospital in [[King's Lynn]], [[Norfolk]]. The new maternity ward was opened by Princess Elizabeth (the future queen, [[Elizabeth II]]), where she was introduced to 16 new mothers including Winifred Taylor, his mother. Taylor first lived at 87 High Street in King's Lynn, and later moved to Beulah Street in the town. Taylor's first school was Rosebury Avenue school.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Trevor|first1=Heaton|title=Rock Star's Norfolk Childhood|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Roger_Taylor_-_03-20-1999_-_Eastern_Daily_Press_-_Rock_Star%27s_Norfolk_Childhood|website=Queen Archives|publisher=Eastern Daily Press}}</ref> Taylor moved to [[Truro]], [[Cornwall]], south west England, with his mother Winifred, father Michael and younger sister Clare. When he was seven years old, he and some friends formed his first band, the Bubblingover Boys, in which he played the [[ukulele]]. He briefly attended [[Truro Cathedral School]]; at the age of 13, he joined [[Truro School]] as a day boy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://themarchoftheblackqueen.piczo.com/?g=57322673&cr=6|title=Roger|publisher=themarchoftheblackqueen.piczo.com|accessdate=8 April 2012}}</ref> At the age of 15, Taylor became a member of the Reaction, a semi-professional rock band formed mainly of boys from Truro School. Taylor had originally learned guitar, but became a drummer when he realised he had a more natural aptitude for it. Taylor taught himself to tune his drums, inspired by [[Keith Moon]] of [[the Who]] because of the \"great drums sounds\" on the early Who records.<ref name=\"Roger Taylor Interview\">{{cite web | url= http://www.queenzone.com/articles/roger-taylor-interview.aspx | title= Roger Taylor Interview | publisher= Queen Zone | accessdate= 10 August 2015 | url-status=dead | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150715215326/http://www.queenzone.com/articles/roger-taylor-interview.aspx | archivedate= 15 July 2015 | df= dmy-all }}</ref> Another key influence on Taylor was drummer [[Mitch Mitchell]] of [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]], who Taylor stated was his early role model.<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\">{{cite web | url= http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/interviews/roger-taylor-1/drum-master-class/ | title= Roger's Drum Master Class (Music Works - BBC World Service, November 28, 1993) | publisher=Queen Online | accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1967, Taylor went to London to study dentistry at the [[Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry|London Hospital Medical College]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/members/roger-taylor/|title=Roger Taylor |website=Queen official website|access-date=15 January 2017}}</ref> but he became bored with dentistry.

Smile included May on lead guitar, Staffell on lead vocals and bass, and later Taylor on drums. The band lasted for two years before Staffell departed to join [[Humpy Bong]], leaving the band with a catalogue of nine songs.\n\nSmile reunited for several songs on 22 December 1992. Taylor's band [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]] were headliners and he brought May and Staffell on to play \"Earth\" and \"If I Were a Carpenter\".<ref>[http://www.queenzone.com/queenzone/article_show.aspx?Q=11]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208151834/http://www.queenzone.com/queenzone/article_show.aspx?Q=11 |date=8 February 2007 }}</ref>\n\n=== 1970s\u2013present: Queen ===\n{{Main|Queen (band)}}\n[[Image:Hannover7907.jpg|thumb|right|Taylor performing with [[Queen (band)|Queen]] in 1979.]]\n\nIn 1969, Taylor was working with [[Freddie Mercury]] at the Kensington Market (they were sharing a flat at around the same time). Mercury, then known as Freddie Bulsara, was an avid fan of Smile. The band split up in 1970. In the same year, Taylor turned down the chance to become drummer for [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], which led to [[Phil Collins]] joining instead.<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/8784298/Queen-40th-anniversary-10-things-you-never-knew.html | title= Queen 40th anniversary: 10 things you never knew | work=The Daily Telegraph | date=24 September 2011 | accessdate=27 August 2015}}</ref> Bulsara convinced the remaining two members of Smile to continue and he eventually joined the band, which he renamed Queen. In 1971, they recruited bass guitarist [[John Deacon]], before going on to release their [[Queen (Queen album)|self-titled debut album]] in 1973. Taylor is the third most credited songwriter for the band, usually contributing one or two tracks per album.\n\n===1977\u2013present: Solo career===\nTaylor has had a productive solo career, releasing five albums. His first single was his 1977 \"I Wanna Testify\". He recorded it during Queen's sessions for the ''[[News of the World (album)|News of the World]]'' album. The A-side, although a cover of the Parliaments song of the same name, was completely different from the original. The B-side was a self-penned song \"Turn on the TV\".\n\nTaylor's first solo album, ''[[Fun in Space]]'', was released in 1981. Taylor performed all vocals and played all instruments aside of about half of the keyboards, which were done by engineer [[David Richards (record producer)|David Richards]]. With Queen still touring heavily and recording at the time of release, Taylor was unable to promote the album to its fullest extent, so he appeared on some European TV shows to promote the single, \"Future Management\", including ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. The only other single to come from the album was \"My Country\". The only US single released from the album was \"Let's Get Crazy\".\n\nTaylor's next venture, ''[[Strange Frontier]]'', came in June 1984. The three singles from the album were the title track, \"Beautiful Dreams\" (in Portugal only) and \"Man on Fire\", the latter becoming a live favourite for him in later years. No attempts to promote the singles were made since Queen toured to promote ''[[The Works (Queen album)|The Works]]'', and Taylor did not perform on any TV shows. ''Strange Frontier'' included guest appearances by bandmates Freddie Mercury, Brian May and John Deacon. Mercury sang backing vocals on \"Killing Time\", Deacon remixed the B-side \"I Cry For You\" and [[Rick Parfitt]] co-wrote and played on \"It's An Illusion\". David Richards, Queen's engineer and producer at the time, also co-wrote two of the tracks. The album includes covers of [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s \"[[Racing in the Street]]\" and [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[Masters of War]]\".\n\nIn 1986, Taylor co-produced ''[[Vigilante (Magnum album)|Vigilante]]'', the sixth studio album by rock band [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Patrick Lemieux | author2=Adam Unger |title=The Queen Chronology: The Recording & Release History of the Band|year=2013|page=54|publisher=Across the Board Books|isbn=978-0991984046}}</ref>\n\nAfter Queen finished their 1986 [[A Kind of Magic|Magic Tour]], Taylor started a new band, [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], which released three albums over their six years of existence. In 1993, the band split up, after performing one final gig at the [[Wickham Festival#History|Gosport Festival]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/roger-taylor-21213223|title=Roger Taylor|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Taylor worked with [[Yoshiki (musician)|Yoshiki]], drummer and pianist of [[X Japan]] and released the song \"Foreign Sand\" and a reworking of the Cross's \"Final Destination\". The album ''Happiness?'' was \"Dedicated to the tasmanian tiger \u2013 thylacinus cynocephalus, but most especially... for Freddie\". \"Nazis 1994\" from this album became Taylor's first hit single in England and was followed by two other top 40 UK hits, \"Happiness\" and \"Foreign Sand\".\n\nIn 1998, Taylor released his fourth solo album ''[[Electric Fire]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gZIjT8PgJMEC&pg=PA499&lpg=PA499&dq=In+1998,+Taylor+released+his+fourth+solo+album+Electric+Fire.&source=bl&ots=XBU0kDQe4_&sig=BBO6TCasZB87g_GSrP6vLq5xblE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwinuvqOrMvZAhVBmBQKHZAEB34Q6AEIajAI#v=onepage&q=In%201998,%20Taylor%20released%20his%20fourth%20solo%20album%20Electric%20Fire.&f=false|title=The International Who's Who in Popular Music 2002|last=Gregory|first=Andy|date=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9781857431612|language=en}}</ref> He supported it with a small tour in the spring of 1999, on which Brian May joined him at the gig in Wolverhampton. Taylor also performed one of the first Internet-gigs \u2013 for which he got a mention in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]].<ref>[http://www.queencollector.com/Articles/Solo10/roger.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930042840/http://www.queencollector.com/Articles/Solo10/roger.html |date=30 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, after nearly twelve years between solo albums, Taylor planned to release a new studio album titled ''[[The Unblinking Eye (Everything Is Broken)|The Unblinking Eye]]''. The first single, of the same name, was released on 23 November 2009 as a digital download, but due to popular demand it was released as a limited edition single.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenonline.com/news/1517/|title=QueenOnline \u2013 News |date=17 November 2009 |accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref> Originally leaked to the official Queen fan club's website for members only, it still managed to be on YouTube within hours of the early bird release. It was announced in late 2012 that fans would be able to vote on which songs appeared on the new album, with the album itself slated for release that year.\n\nThe album is called ''[[Fun on Earth]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planetrock.com/news/rock-news/roger-taylor-to-release-solo-album/ |title=Roger Taylor To Release Solo Album &#124; Rock News &#124; News |publisher=Planet Rock |date=22 November 2012 |accessdate=27 June 2013}}</ref> and was released on 11 November 2013.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6296827/queen-roger-taylor-solo-record-adam-lambert|title=Queen's Roger Taylor Talks Solo Work, Hopes Band Will Record With Adam Lambert|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref>\n\n=== The Cross ===\n{{Main|The Cross (band)}}\n\nThe Cross were a side project of Taylor's that existed from 1987 to 1993 and released three albums. While still the drummer for Queen, Taylor fronted the Cross as rhythm guitarist and lead vocalist. On its debut release, ''The Cross'' incorporated dance influences which they dropped on their remaining two albums. The band never enjoyed much commercial success, except in Germany.\n\n=== ''Shove It'' ===\n[[Image:The Cross 1990 Neu Isenburg 1.jpg|thumb|Taylor performing with [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]] in 1990]]\n\nAfter Queen's 1986 Magic Tour, the band members went their separate ways to do various solo work. Taylor decided to form a new band with whom he could tour. He had already written and recorded the album himself before finding a band to play the songs with. He eventually placed an ad for band members in a national newspaper, hinting he was a famous rock musician. The position of keyboard player was duly offered to [[Spike Edney]] after two successful Queen tours in which Edney had played. When the auditions were over, the line-up was completed by Peter Noone on bass, Clayton Moss on guitar and [[Josh Macrae]] on drums. Taylor himself would take the responsibility on lead vocals and rhythm guitar.\n\nThe first album, ''Shove It'', was released in 1988.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Cross-Shove-It/release/6351445|title=The Cross (3) - Shove It|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/shove-it-mw0000651910|title=Shove It - Cross {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref> In Europe, '[[Heaven for Everyone]]\" (later a Queen song) contained Freddie Mercury on lead vocals and Taylor on backing vocals. However, on the single version and American album version the roles were switched. The European CD contained an extra track (compared to cassette and LP) in the 2nd Shelf Mix, the US version having \"Feel the Force\" as its extra track. The band promoted hard (especially in Germany), with many TV performances of singles including an appearance at the Montreux Golden Rose festival in 1988. The tour took in dates in the UK and Germany. Three singles were released from the album: \"Cowboys and Indians\", \"Heaven for Everyone\" and \"Shove It\". Another single, \"Manipulator\", was released in 1988, but it was not included on any album. It was also the only song from the time that had joint writing credits, Taylor sharing them with Edney and Steve Strange.\n\n=== ''Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know'' ===\n[[Image:The Cross 1990 Neu Isenburg 2.jpg|thumb|Taylor performing with the Cross in 1990.]]\n\nAfter finishing Queen's 1989 album ''[[The Miracle (album)|The Miracle]]'', Taylor went into the studio with the rest of the Cross for the first time to record ''[[Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know (The Cross album)|Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know]]''. The band composed the opening track \"On Top of the World Ma\" with a riff bearing a resemblance to the [[Led Zeppelin]] track \"[[Whole Lotta Love]]\". The rest of the album consisted mainly of individually written songs, except for \"Power To Love\" which was the result of the combined effort of Macrae, Noone and Moss. Clayton Moss sang lead vocals on his own track \"Better Things\", and Spike Edney played [[mandolin]] on \"Final Destination\", which was written by Taylor. \"Final Destination\" was released as a single, as were \"Liar\" and \"Power To Love\", the latter being the last single to be released in the UK by the band. \"Final Destination\" came with a live rendition of Taylor's song \"Man on Fire\" as a B-side, and \"Liar\" (Noone) had a brand new track, \"In Charge of My Heart\", which was also penned by Taylor. The 12\" single and CD of \"Liar\" also included extended remixes of both \"Liar\" and \"In Charge of My Heart\". The instrumental section at the beginning of \"In Charge of My Heart\" was used as the opening to concerts on the accompanying tour. \"Closer To You\" (Edney) had been planned to be released in America, but never was. The group having seemingly given up on the UK market, the accompanying tour only included dates in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Ibiza. Unusual for such tours, every song from the new album was played live.\n\n=== ''Blue Rock'' ===\nMade at a time when Taylor's efforts were concentrated on Queen and Mercury himself, ''[[Blue Rock (album)|Blue Rock]]'' gave the other members of the band a chance to take control of the upcoming album. It was in fact mostly written by Edney, who contributed three of his own tracks and contributed to four more. Once again the opening track was penned by the entire band, \"Bad Attitude\" was written (although not complete) by the Christmas fan club party of 1990. The album itself contained a lot of vocals not from Taylor, but mainly of Edney and Noone. Examples of this can be heard in \"Put It All Down To Love\" (Edney), \"Life Changes\" (Moss, Noone, Edney and Macrae) and \"Heartland\" (The B-side to Life Changes, penned by Noone). Blue Rock itself was only released in Germany (although promo copies were released in Italy and Japan), so copies are somewhat rare. \"New Dark Ages\" (Taylor) was released in Germany with another live version of \"Man on Fire\", whilst \"Life Changes\" was released with the B-side \"Heartland\". It was however immediately withdrawn due to Mercury's death. The tour was in support of [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]], so the concert lengths were short (45 mins.) and very few bootlegs have survived. The tour pace was rapid, covering 20 dates in one month.\n\n=== Break-up of the Cross ===\nThe band broke up in 1993 after performing a final show. Taylor continued working with Queen and produced solo albums. Drummer Macrae accompanied Taylor on his solo tours and also played percussion at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert. Both Taylor and keyboardist Edney participated in the [[Queen + Paul Rodgers]] tours, while Macrae worked behind the scenes as co-producer, sound engineer and Pro Tools engineer for them. In the late 1990s, Edney formed the SAS Band (\"Spike's All Stars\"), a group with an ever-changing line-up of popular '80s musicians.\n\n=== 21st century ===\nTaylor has appeared along with May for various other events and promotions, including Queen's induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2001<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/queen |title=Queen: inducted in 2001 &#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |publisher=Rockhall.com |date=15 April 2013 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}</ref> and the \"[[Party at the Palace]]\" in 2002, celebrating the golden jubilee of [[Queen Elizabeth II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenvault.com/patp.html |title=Party at the Palace |publisher=QueenVault.com |date=3 June 2002 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}</ref> In 2004, Taylor, May, and Mike Dixon received the [[Helpmann Award]] for Best Music Direction for the musical [[We Will Rock You (musical)|''We Will Rock You'']].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.helpmannawards.com.au/2004/past-nominees-and-winners/industry-awards|title=Past nominees and winners Helpmann Awards|accessdate=16 December 2016}}</ref>  At [[Live Earth]] in 2007, Taylor opened the concert with [[Taylor Hawkins]] of [[Foo Fighters]] and [[Chad Smith]] of [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]].\n\nTaylor and May, performing as Queen, also appeared three times on the American singing contest television show ''[[American Idol]]''. The first appearance was on 11 April 2006, during which that week's contestants were required to sing a Queen song. Songs performed included \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\", \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\", \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\", and \"[[Innuendo (song)|Innuendo]]\". The second time Queen appeared was on the show's [[American Idol (season 8)|season 8]] finale in May 2009, performing \"We Are the Champions\" with finalists [[Adam Lambert]] and [[Kris Allen]].

He said: \"I still think listening to Mitch Mitchell, especially the early stuff with Hendrix, is just fantastic.

Not just marking time\".<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\"/>\n\nTaylor has also expressed great admiration for [[John Bonham]] of [[Led Zeppelin]]. Speaking of Bonham, Taylor said, \"The greatest rock and roll drummer of all time was John Bonham, who did things that nobody had ever even thought possible before with the drum kit. And also the greatest sound out of his drums \u2013 they sounded enormous, and just one bass drum. So fast on it that he did more with one bass drum than most people could do with three, if they could manage them. And he had technique to burn and fantastic power and tremendous feel for rock and roll\".<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\"/> However, for just sheer technique, Taylor described the jazz and [[big band]] drummer [[Buddy Rich]] as \"the best I've ever seen\".<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\"/>\n\nSpeaking to ''[[Modern Drummer]]'' in 1984, Taylor also described [[Keith Moon]], the drummer of [[the Who]], as \"absolutely brilliant...he had a total unique style; he didn't owe anyone anything.\"<ref name=\"Roger Taylor Interview\"/>\n\n== Tributes ==\nIn 2013, a newly-discovered species of the genus ''[[Heteragrion]]'' (Odonata : Zygoptera) from Brazil was named ''Heteragrion rogertaylori'' after Taylor, in honour of his \"powerful sound, wonderful lyrics and raspy voice \"{{spaced ndash}}one of four ''Heteragrion'' flatwing [[Damselfly|damselflies]] named after the bandmates, paying tribute to the 40th anniversary of Queen's founding.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2013/f/z03685p080f.pdf|title = Diagnoses and discussion of the group 1 and 2 Brazilian species of Heteragrion, with descriptions of four new species (Odonata: Megapodagrionidae).

2013. During the festival, no foreign films are shown in Philippine theaters in order to showcase locally produced films (except in select [[3D film|3D]] cinemas and [[IMAX]] theaters).\n\n==Entries==\nIn the last week of May 2012, film producers and companies already submitted their scripts in participation with the festival. However, it will still be reviewed by the [[Metropolitan Manila Development Authority]] to sort out entries. Of the fifteen film entries submitted, eight were chosen as the official entries. ''[[Mga Kwento ni Lola Basyang]]'' was one of the eight entries chosen, but the producer sent a letter to MMDA to pull out of the film festival. On October 19, 2012 it was replaced by [[Nora Aunor]]'s ''[[Thy Womb]]''.<ref>[http://reynthology.blogspot.com/2012/10/thy-womb-replaces-lola-basyang-as.html 'Thy Womb' replaces 'Lola Basyang' as MMFF 2012 official entry] ''Reyn's Room''.

Kennedy Memorial Bridge''' is a six-lane, single-deck [[cantilever bridge]] that carries southbound [[Interstate 65]] across the [[Ohio River]], connecting [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Kentucky]] and [[Jeffersonville, Indiana|Jeffersonville]], [[Indiana]].  The main span is {{convert|700|ft|sigfig=3}} (two spans) and the bridge has a total length of {{convert|2498|ft}}.  The span carries six southbound lanes. It is named after [[U.S. President]] [[John F. Kennedy]].\n\n==History==\nDesigned by the Louisville engineering firm of Hazelet & Erdal, construction began in the spring of 1961 and completed in late 1963 at a cost of $10 million. The span was unnamed when [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] was [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassinated]] on November 22, 1963. Four days later, [[Governor of Kentucky|Kentucky Governor]] [[Bert T. Combs]] announced that there was wide agreement that the bridge would be named in Kennedy's honor. The bridge was dedicated and opened for northbound traffic on December 6, and southbound traffic began flowing a few weeks later.\n\nBetween the late 1990s and 2006, the bridge was covered with rust-like spots and the [[Kentucky Transportation Cabinet]] had failed in attempts to rectify this, a subject of local controversy.  The state twice paid contractors to repaint the bridge who then failed to do so.  The attempts cost over $23 million, with little apparent result. The first of the two contracts, awarded in 1999, ended two years later in a bribery scandal that resulted in criminal prosecution.<ref>{{cite news| first=Sheldon S.| last=Shafer| url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courier_journal/access/1771825901.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Feb+9%2C+2006&author=&pub=Courier+-+Journal&edition=&startpage=B.1&desc=Kennedy+Bridge+painting+deal+canceled| title=Kennedy Bridge painting deal canceled; State says job only 6 percent complete |work=[[The Courier-Journal]] |accessdate=2006-07-23 |date=February 9, 2006 |location=Louisville}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2006, the state awarded a $14.7 million contract to [[Intech Contracting]] of Lexington to paint half the bridge by the summer of 2007. The new contract differed in that the project was split in two, and the original plans for a three color paint scheme were replaced with a simpler all beige colored one. The very southernmost portion of the bridge was completed in three colors (brown, beige, and green), although this will be painted over.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courier_journal/access/1766271891.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=May+09,+2006&author=&pub=Courier+-+Journal&desc=State+seeks+new+Kennedy+Bridge+painter&pqatl=google |first=Sheldon S. |last=Shafer |title=State awards $14.7 million bid to paint half of Kennedy Bridge |date=October 16, 2006 |work=The Courier-Journal}}</ref>\n\nOn December 5, 2007, the painting project was completed at a cost of $59 million which included the two previous failed painting projects.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.whas11.com/topstories/stories/120407whasjdtopstorybridge.6afad7f5.html |title=The Kennedy Bridge project complete |date=2007-12-05 |work=[[WHAS-TV]] News }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\n[[File:John F.
