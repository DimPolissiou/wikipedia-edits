The review was conducted by a panel of experts led by [[Norman Augustine]], the former CEO of [[Lockheed Martin]], who served on the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology under both Democrat and Republican presidents.\n\nThe \"[[Review of United States Human Space Flight Plans Committee|Review of United States Human Space Flight Plans]]\" was to examine ongoing and planned National Aeronautics and Space Administration ([[NASA]]) development activities, as well as potential alternatives and present options for advancing a safe, innovative, affordable, and sustainable human space flight program in the years following Space Shuttle retirement. The panel worked closely with NASA and sought input from the [[United States Congress]], [[the White House]], the public, industry, and international partners as it developed its options. It presented its results on October 22, 2009.<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/358006main_OSTP%20Press%20Release.pdf OSTP Press Release Announcing Review (pdf, 50k)]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = No to NASA: Augustine Commission Wants to More Boldly Go|url = http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2009/10/no-nasa-augusti.html|accessdate = 2015-07-14|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130513130114/http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2009/10/no-nasa-augusti.html|archivedate = 2013-05-13}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2010, Obama announced his proposal to cancel the Constellation Program as part of the 2011 Economic Projects.

After a near perfect flight traveling {{convert|3600|mi}} above Earth, the spacecraft was recovered for study.  NASA plans to use the Orion crew vehicle to send humans to deep space locations such as the Moon and Mars starting in the 2020s.

{"title_page": "Copper Basin (Tennessee)", "text_new": "{{Other uses|Copper Basin (disambiguation){{!}}Copper Basin}}\n{{short description|Geological area in southeastern Tennessee, United States}}\nThe '''Copper Basin''', also known as the '''Ducktown Basin''', is a [[geology|geological]] region located primarily in [[Polk County, Tennessee]] that contains deposits of [[copper]] ore and covers approximately 60,000 acres. Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the surrounding landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the [[Ducktown Basin Museum]] chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.{{sfn|Ross|1935|p=95-96}}{{sfn|Emmons & Laney|1926|p=13}}\n\nThe [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.{{sfn|Ross|1935|p=95-96}}\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]]. Other communities include Postelle in the northwest section of the basin, Isabella in the eastern portion, and Harbuck, [[Turtletown, Tennessee|Turtletown]], and [[Farner, Tennessee|Farner]] just north of the basin.<ref>{{cite map |author = Tennessee Department of Transportation Long Range Planning Division Office of Data Visualization|title = Polk County|year = 2018|url =https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tdot/maps/county-maps-(us-shields)/o-w/Polk%20County.pdf|publisher = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]]}}</ref> The Copper Basin is also included in the [[Cleveland metropolitan area, Tennessee|Cleveland, Tennessee metropolitan area]].<ref>{{cite press release|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=OMB Designates 49 New Metropolitan Statistical Areas|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/assets/OMB/pubpress/2003-18.pdf|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[Executive branch of the United States government]]|agency=[[Office of Management and Budget]]|date=June 6, 2003|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>\n\nMost of the rocks in the Copper Basin are [[metamorphic rock]]s deposited during the [[Cambrian|Lower Cambrian period]], but also include some [[igneous rock]]s.

As early as 1861, trees were becoming scarce, and in 1876, the companies began importing logs from Fannin County, Georgia. The smelting process released [[sulfur]] gas, which reacted with [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere, forming [[sulfuric acid]] and precipitating as [[acid rain]]. This subsequently killed the majority of the vegetation in the basin, and [[Stormwater runoff|ran off]] into the Ocoee River and surrounding tributaries, killing most aquatic life. This also resulted in erosion of the topsoil, much of which ended up in the Ocoee River.<ref name=gms/> The reddish-brown landscape that resulted, which consisted mostly of iron and copper ore, was often compared to a [[desert]] and the surface of [[Mars]], and was distinctly visible from space.<ref>{{cite news|last=Benton|first=Ben|date=2020-01-01|title=Copper Basin restoration work earns engineering award|url=https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2020/jan/01/copper-basin-work-engineering-award/511930/|work=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]|location=Chattanooga, Tennessee|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> A total of 32,000 acres were affected.<ref name=tva>{{cite web|url=https://www.tva.gov/Environment/Environmental-Stewardship/Land-Management/The-Greening-of-Copper-Basin|title=The Greening of Copper Basin|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=tva.gov|publisher=Tennessee Valley Authority|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Copper-basin-satellite-1984.png|thumb|right|Satellite image showing the Copper Basin in 1984]]\nThe state of Georgia began suing the Tennessee Copper Company in the mid 1880s, claiming that the mining operations were causing damage to forests and crops in northern Georgia.

Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the surrounding landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the [[Ducktown Basin Museum]] chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.{{sfn|Ross|1935|p=95-96}}\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]].

As early as 1861, trees were becoming scarce, and in 1876, the companies began importing logs from Fannin County, Georgia. The smelting process released [[sulfur]] gas, which reacted with [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere, forming [[sulfuric acid]] and precipitating as [[acid rain]]. This subsequently killed the majority of the vegetation in the basin, and [[Stormwater runoff|ran off]] into the Ocoee River and surrounding tributaries, killing most aquatic life.

They write me askin' should they put on spiked shoes for the marathon!\" According to fellow race official Will Cloney: \"He hurls not only his body at them, but also a rather choice array of epithets... Jock's method of attack is apt to vary.\" In 1957, Semple narrowly escaped arrest for assault after attempting to knock down a marathon competitor who was wearing webbed snorkeler's shoes and a grotesque mask. \"The thing that made me so damned mad,\" Semple said, \"was that the guy was runnin' with the good runners.\" at the 6.5 mile mark<ref name=\"SI_AngryOverseer\" />\n\n[[Bobbi Gibb|Roberta \"Bobbi\" Gibb]], completed the 1967 Boston Marathon unofficially; she had completed the marathon in 1966 having been denied an official entry by race director Will Cloney who rejected her registration with the claim that women were physiologically incapable of running 26 miles.

Religious and nationalist, it is affiliated with the conservative right-wing Israeli parties. \nThe paper was originally led by secular writers but over the years it became more religious. Makor Rishon is associated with the Settlers positions and is considered to have a qualitative impact on senior [[Likud]] and [[Jewish Home]].\n\n== History ==\n''Makor Rishon'' was founded as a weekly magazine in July 1997 in order to create an independent [[newspaper]] with a [[Judaism|Jewish]] religious and nationalistic slant. The paper was the brainchild of its original owner, [[Rabbi Shmuel Tal]]. The Listenberg family, a National Religious family in the diamond business based in Belgium and [[Tel Aviv|Tel]] Aviv financed the founding of the newspaper. [[Journalist]] [[Meir Uziel]] was hired to recruit the staff. Uziel enlisted [[Michael Ruzulio]] to find writers. Ruzulio had served as a reporter for ''[[Yedioth Ahronoth]]'' as well as for the [[Second Authority for Television and Radio]], and helped create the \u201c[[Voice of the Red Sea]]\u201d radio station. The newsroom was established in the \u201cPirsum Yisrael\u201d offices located in [[Givat Shaul]] in [[Jerusalem]] and included religious and secular journalists and editors.\n\nThe majority of the newspaper's editors in its early years were secular and included Meir Uziel, Michael Ruzulio, [[Yehuda Levi (journalist)]] and [[Ofer Shapira]].\n\nEarnings from the paper were low and its financial situation worsened. The paper closed down at the end of October 1999, after which the owners filed for bankruptcy.\n\n''Makor Rishon'' was reestablished after five weeks, in December 1999, under the auspices of a company named \u201cThe New Makor Rishon\u201d \u2013 a move that enabled its purchaser, Dr. Michael Karash, to derive benefit from the newspaper's name without having to be burdened by past debts. Karash worked to broaden the subscriber base and to make the paper financially viable. Over the course of 2003, the paper was purchased by businessman Shlomo Ben-Tzvi.  After the buyout, changes were made that included  a significant increase in the number of pages and journalists as well as a move to a broadsheet  newspaper format.\n\nUntil mid-2007, ''Makor Rishon'' was published as a weekly. On April 25, 2007, the ''[[HaTzofe]]'' daily was incorporated into ''Makor Rishon'', which started appearing with the logo \u201cMakor Rishon-HaTzofe\u201d. [[Shlomo Ben-Tzvi]], who until then had been the newspaper's [[CEO]], was appointed the editor-in-chief. ''Makor Rishon'' was then published as a daily for the next two years.\n\nIn November 2008, the newspaper entered into financial difficulties.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Makor rishon in recovery plan (in Hebrew)|url = http://www.bizportal.co.il/general/news/article/30126446|website = |accessdate = |language = }}</ref> The employees requested the court liquidate the assets of the paper.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Makor Rishon employees submitted a court appeal (in Hebrew)|url = http://www.bizportal.co.il/general/news/article/30126349|website = |accessdate = |language = }}</ref> The newspaper dealt with the crises by drastically cutting content, raising prices, firing workers, and closing down its website and article archives, among other actions. Starting from June 2009, the paper returned to being a weekly. A reduced daily edition was distributed only to subscribers but was made available on the newspaper's website, and a weekend edition was also attainable at newsstands.\n\nOn February 16, 2012, the newspaper began distributing a free expanded edition at various locations throughout the country, that contained many references to the newspaper's flagship edition that is sold on weekends, a move intended to increase sales and subscribers for the Friday edition.\n\nOn March 9, 2014, Ben-Tzvi's request for a two-month injunction to halt [[bankruptcy]] proceedings against the ''Makor'' ''Rishon'' and ''Ma\u2019ariv'' newspapers was approved by the court. On March 30, 2014, the Jerusalem District Court approved selling the newspaper to ''[[Israel Hayom]]'' for 14 million shekels,.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://mobile.mako.co.il/culture-showbiz/Article-be2570750231541006.htm?sCh=3d385dd2dd5d4110&pId=389626226|title = \"The court approved the sale of \"Makor Rishon\" to \"Israel Hayom\"\" (in Hebrew)|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> and Antitrust Commissioner David Gilo approved the sale one month later.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.themarker.com/advertising/1.2308940|title = Gilo approved selling it to Adelson (in Hebrew)|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nOn September 23, 2014, the daily edition was printed for the last time. Starting from this date, only the weekend edition is published.\n\n== Newspaper format ==\nIn the past, the newspaper had only included a main news section, a news journal and a weekly magazine, ''Diyukan'', that also included a cultural supplement. After Shlomo Ben-Tzvi purchased the newspaper in 2003, new supplements began appearing, which culminated  with the switch to a new format in May 2005. The newspaper has undergone frequent changes since Ben-Tzvi purchased it. In its current format, the paper includes eight sections:\n\n* '''General News''' \u2013 news items; editorial articles; opinion columns; and finance, science, sports and local travel sections.\n*'''Yoman''' (Journal) \u2013 a weekly current affairs supplement containing articles, interviews and personal columns.

Religious and nationalist, it is affiliated with the conservative right-wing Israeli parties. \nThe paper was originally led by secular writers but over the years it became more religious. Makor Rishon is associated with the Settlers positions and is considered to have a qualitative impact on senior [[Likud]] and [[Jewish Home]].\n\n== History ==\n''Makor Rishon'' was founded as a weekly magazine in July 1997 in order to create an independent [[newspaper]] with a [[Judaism|Jewish]] religious and nationalistic slant. The paper was the brainchild of its original owner, [[Rabbi Shmuel Tal]]. The Listenberg family, a National Religious family in the diamond business based in Belgium and [[Tel Aviv|Tel]] Aviv financed the founding of the newspaper. [[Journalist]] [[Meir Uziel]] was hired to recruit the staff. Uziel enlisted [[Michael Ruzulio]] to find writers. Ruzulio had served as a reporter for ''[[Yedioth Ahronoth]]'' as well as for the [[Second Authority for Television and Radio]], and helped create the \u201c[[Voice of the Red Sea]]\u201d radio station. The newsroom was established in the \u201cPirsum Yisrael\u201d offices located in [[Givat Shaul]] in [[Jerusalem]] and included religious and secular journalists and editors.\n\nThe majority of the newspaper's editors in its early years were secular and included Meir Uziel, Michael Ruzulio, [[Yehuda Levi (journalist)]] and [[Ofer Shapira]].\n\nEarnings from the paper were low and its financial situation worsened. The paper closed down at the end of October 1999, after which the owners filed for bankruptcy.\n\n''Makor Rishon'' was reestablished after five weeks, in December 1999, under the auspices of a company named \u201cThe New Makor Rishon\u201d \u2013 a move that enabled its purchaser, Dr. Michael Karash, to derive benefit from the newspaper's name without having to be burdened by past debts. Karash worked to broaden the subscriber base and to make the paper financially viable. Over the course of 2003, the paper was purchased by businessman Shlomo Ben-Tzvi.  After the buyout, changes were made that included  a significant increase in the number of pages and journalists as well as a move to a broadsheet  newspaper format.\n\nUntil mid-2007, ''Makor Rishon'' was published as a weekly. On April 25, 2007, the ''[[HaTzofe]]'' daily was incorporated into ''Makor Rishon'', which started appearing with the logo \u201cMakor Rishon-HaTzofe\u201d. [[Shlomo Ben-Tzvi]], who until then had been the newspaper's [[CEO]], was appointed the editor-in-chief. ''Makor Rishon'' was then published as a daily for the next two years.\n\nIn November 2008, the newspaper entered into financial difficulties.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Makor rishon in recovery plan (in Hebrew)|url = http://www.bizportal.co.il/general/news/article/30126446|website = |accessdate = |language = }}</ref> The employees requested the court liquidate the assets of the paper.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Makor Rishon employees submitted a court appeal (in Hebrew)|url = http://www.bizportal.co.il/general/news/article/30126349|website = |accessdate = |language = }}</ref> The newspaper dealt with the crises by drastically cutting content, raising prices, firing workers, and closing down its website and article archives, among other actions. Starting from June 2009, the paper returned to being a weekly. A reduced daily edition was distributed only to subscribers but was made available on the newspaper's website, and a weekend edition was also attainable at newsstands.\n\nOn February 16, 2012, the newspaper began distributing a free expanded edition at various locations throughout the country, that contained many references to the newspaper's flagship edition that is sold on weekends, a move intended to increase sales and subscribers for the Friday edition.\n\nOn March 9, 2014, Ben-Tzvi's request for a two-month injunction to halt [[bankruptcy]] proceedings against the ''Makor'' ''Rishon'' and ''Ma\u2019ariv'' newspapers was approved by the court. On March 30, 2014, the Jerusalem District Court approved selling the newspaper to ''[[Israel Hayom]]'' for 14 million shekels,.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://mobile.mako.co.il/culture-showbiz/Article-be2570750231541006.htm?sCh=3d385dd2dd5d4110&pId=389626226|title = \"The court approved the sale of \"Makor Rishon\" to \"Israel Hayom\"\" (in Hebrew)|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> and Antitrust Commissioner David Gilo approved the sale one month later.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.themarker.com/advertising/1.2308940|title = Gilo approved selling it to Adelson (in Hebrew)|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nOn September 23, 2014, the daily edition was printed for the last time. Starting from this date, only the weekend edition is published.\n\n== Newspaper format ==\nIn the past, the newspaper had only included a main news section, a news journal and a weekly magazine, ''Diyukan'', that also included a cultural supplement. After Shlomo Ben-Tzvi purchased the newspaper in 2003, new supplements began appearing, which culminated  with the switch to a new format in May 2005. The newspaper has undergone frequent changes since Ben-Tzvi purchased it. In its current format, the paper includes eight sections:\n\n* '''General News''' \u2013 news items; editorial articles; opinion columns; and finance, science, sports and local travel sections.\n*'''Yoman''' (Journal) \u2013 a weekly current affairs supplement containing articles, interviews and personal columns.
