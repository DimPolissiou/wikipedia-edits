{"title_page": "List of Anglo-Welsh wars", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2011}}\nThis is an incomplete list of the wars and battles between the [[Anglo-Saxons]] who later formed into the [[Kingdom of England]] and the Britons (the pre-existing [[Britons (historical)|Brythonic]] population of Britain south of the [[Antonine Wall]] who came to be known later by the English as the Welsh), as well as the conflicts between the English and Welsh in subsequent centuries. The list begins after the ''[[Adventus Saxonum]]'' in c. AD 446 (when the Anglo-Saxons are said to have arrived in Britain) to the late Middle Ages when Wales was eventually subdued and annexed by England. The list is not exhaustive but seeks to note the significant campaigns and the major battles.\n\n==Fifth Century==\n\n[[Germanic Paganism|Pagan]] Germanic tribes who have colonized parts of the eastern and southern coasts of Britannia attack the Britons (which the Anglo-Saxons dub \"Wealsc\") in a series of coordinated uprisings. Additional reinforcements from [[Old Saxony]], [[Angeln]], [[Flanders]] and [[Jutland]] make landings and through conquest and treaty occupy large areas of eastern and south eastern Britain.\n\n[[File:Public Schools Historical Atlas - Roman Britain 400.jpg|frameless|right|241px]]\n\n* c.452 The Germanic people settled on the eastern \"[[Saxon Shore]]\" of Britain rise in a revolt led by [[Hengest]] and his sons against their Romano British masters.\n* c.455 ''Battle of Aylesford'' \u2013 [[Anglo-Saxon]]s (particularly a group called [[Jutes]]) led by [[Hengest]] defeat the Britons (Welsh) led by [[Vortimer]] in Battle at Aylesford, Kent.\n* c.456 ''Battle of Crayford'' \u2013 Anglo-Saxons ([[Jute]]s) led again by Hengest defeat the Britons (Welsh) led by [[Vortimer]] in battle. The Britons are driven from ([[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]]) which is afterwards ruled by Hengist and his son [[Oisc of Kent|\u00c6sc]] and their descendants.\n* c.466 ''[[Battle of Wippedsfleot]]'' \u2013 Britons (Welsh) perhaps defeat the Anglo-Saxons (Jutes) in battle in Kent and confine them to the [[Isle of Thanet]].\n* c.473 The Anglo-Saxons (Jutes) move westwards and drive the Britons once again out of Kent.\n* c.477 ''Battle of [[Cymenshore|Cymensora]]'' \u2013 Anglo-Saxons ([[Saxon]]s) led by [[\u00c6lle of Sussex|\u00c6lle]] defeat the Britons (Welsh) close to [[Selsey]].\n* c.486 ''Battle on the River Glein'' \u2013 Arthur of the Britons is reputed to have defeated the Anglo-Saxons.\n* c.490 Second, third and fourth battles of Arthur in ''Linnuis'' thought to be modern [[Lindsey (government district)|Lindsey]] where he led the Britons to defeat the Anglo-Saxons at each battle.\n* c.491 ''Siege of [[Anderida]]'' \u2013 Anglo-Saxons (Saxons) led by \u00c6lle capture the Castle of Anderida from the Britons (Welsh) and slaughter the inhabitants. \u00c6lle establishes the Kingdom of the [[South Saxons]] (Sussex).\n* c.492 ''Battle of Bassas'' \u2013 Arthur defeats the Anglo-Saxons at an unidentified location.\n* c.493 ''Battle of Guinnion'' \u2013 Arthur defeats the Anglo-Saxons in battle. The site was probably at [[Winchester]] which was then known as ''Caer Guintguic''.\n* c.495 ''Battle of Urbe Legionis'' \u2013 Arthur defeats the Anglo-Saxons in battle at the \"City of the Legions\" which is thought to probably by [[Chester]].\n* c.495 A man named [[Cerdic]] reputedly defeats the Britons (Welsh) in battle close to modern day [[Bournemouth]] and establishes kingdom of the [[West Saxons]] (Wessex).\n* c.496 ''Battle of [[Mons Badonicus]]'' \u2013 The Anglo-Saxons are soundly defeated in battle by the Britons (possibly led by [[King Arthur]]) at a site generally thought to be close to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]. This defeat establishes 50 years of relative peace.\n\n==Sixth Century==\n[[File:Britain.circa.540.jpg|frameless|right|241px]]\n\nPagan Anglo-Saxon tribes conquer southern Britain capturing [[London]], [[Colchester]], [[Silchester]], [[Chichester]], [[Winchester]], [[Grantchester]], [[Leicester]], [[Gloucester]], [[Cirencester]], [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[York]], [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] and [[Canterbury]] among other places. Later in the century [[Angles]] defeat the northern Britons and colonize the north eastern coast.\n\n* c.509 ''Battle of Natanleod'' \u2013 the [[West Saxons]] led by [[Cerdic]] defeat the Britons at [[Netley]], Hampshire.\n* 519 Another battle in which Cerdic is victorious. He establishes the [[Kingdom of Wessex]] at this point.\n* 527 ''Battle of Cerdicesleag'' \u2013 the West Saxons led by Cerdic and his son [[Cynric]] defeat the Britons.\n* 530 The Britons (Welsh) of the [[Isle of Wight]] are conquered by the Anglo-Saxons (Jutes).\n* 547 the Northern Angles led by [[Ida of Bernicia|Ida the Flamebearer]] capture the fortress of [[Bamburgh|Din Guyaroi]] from the Britons of the Kingdom of [[Bernicia|Bryneich]].\n* c.550 Presumed date for the fall of [[Londinium]] (London) and [[Camulodunum]] (Colchester) to the [[East Saxons]].\n* 575 a northern alliance of the Britons led by [[Urien Rheged|King Urien]] of [[Rheged]] defeat the Angles of [[Bernicia]] and besiege them on [[Lindisfarne|Ynys Metcaut]] for three days.\n* 577 ''[[Battle of Deorham]]'' where the West Saxons and their allies captured the Welsh fortress at Hinton Hill near [[Dyrham]] in modern Gloucestershire. The Welsh of the Severn Valley attempted to retake this strategic location but were defeated with three of their kings killed in the fighting. The West Saxons went on to capture [[Gloucester]], [[Cirencester]] and [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] thus separating the \"West Welsh\"  of the [[South West Peninsula]] from the Welsh of modern Wales.\n* 580 ''Battle of Ebrauc'' where the Angles of [[Bernicia]] capture the city of [[Ebrauc]] (modern [[York]]).\n* 584 ''Battle of Tintern'' where the armies of the [[Kingdom of Gwent]], led by [[Tewdrig]] and his son [[Meurig]] defeated the West Saxons and forced them to retreat from the [[Gloucester]] area. Tewdrig was mortally wounded and died three days after the battle.\n* 590 the northern alliance of the Britons is defeated following the assassination of their leader and divisions between the former allies.\n* 598 ''Battle of [[Catterick, North Yorkshire|Catraeth]]'' \u2013 the northern Angles led by [[Aethelfrith of Northumbria|\u00c6thelfrith]] destroy the remaining forces of the Britons of Gododdin and Bryneich (Bernicia).\n\n==Seventh Century==\n[[File:Yr.Hen.Ogledd.550.650.Koch.jpg|frameless|right|241px]]\n\nThe Anglo-Saxons consolidate their hold on southern and eastern Britain. The [[Mercia]]n Angles made substantial gains in central Britain (today known as the [[English Midlands]]). [[Cambria]] is cut off from the Britons of the north west and the south west. The Anglo-Saxons convert to [[Christianity]] by the middle of the century. The last serious attempts by the Welsh to reclaim Britain fail.\n\n* 614 ''Battle of Beandun'' \u2013 The West Saxons led by [[Cynegils]] defeat the West Welsh, possibly led by Tewdwr ap Peredur, at [[Badbury Rings]], [[Dorset]]. In what is likely to have been a siege over two thousand Welsh warriors died following the capture of the fort. After this battle it is likely Dorset was annexed by Wessex.\n* 616 ''[[Battle of Chester]]'' \u2013 the Northern Angles of Northumbria led by [[Aethelfrith of Northumbria]] defeat an alliance of Powys and Gwynedd and capture the city of [[Chester]] amid great slaughter.\n* 619 The united [[Northumbria]]n Angles led by [[Edwin of Northumbria]] invade and conquer [[Elmet]], a Welsh territory close to modern [[Leeds]]. The Kingdom of Elmet is occupied and its last ruler, [[Ceretic of Elmet|Ceretic]], is driven into exile in Powys where soon after he dies.\n* 629 The Northumbrians invade Gwynedd and drive [[Cadwallon ap Cadfan]] into exile.\n* 630 The Battle of Pont y Saeson Tewdrig King of Gwent together with Meurig, took up arms and drove back the Saxons\n* 630 \"The Battle of Cefn Digoll, also known as the Battle of the Long Mynd was a battle fought in 630 at Long Mountain near Welshpool . \n* 633 ''[[Battle of Hatfield Chase]]'' near [[Doncaster]]. The battle was fought between the Northumbrian army of King Edwin and an anti-Northumbrian alliance between King Cadwallon of Gwynedd and Penda of Mercia.The battle ended in the death of Edwin and of Northumbrian domination of Gwynedd, and preceded a Welsh campaign into Northumbria. Cadwallon occupied and ravages Northumbria, capturing York and killing many members of the Northumbrian dynasty. \n* 634 ''[[Battle of Heavenfield]]'' near [[Hadrian's Wall]] where Cadwallon is defeated and killed by the Northumbrians led by [[Oswald of Northumbria]]. The Welsh are driven from Northumbria ending any pretensions at regaining the North.\n* 638 The Britons of [[Gododdin]] are defeated at [[Edinburgh|Din Eidin]] and forced to retreat inland to [[Catterick, North Yorkshire|Catreath]].\n* 642 ''Battle of Maes Cogwy'' near [[Oswestry]] where the Welsh alongside their Mercian allies were defeated by the Northumbrians.\n* 650 ''Battle of Bradford on Avon'', a West Saxon victory against the West Welsh.\n* 655 Battle of the Winwaed in which King Oswiu of Bernicia defeated and killed King Penda of Mercia.

The West Saxons move to conquer western Somerset.\n* 665 ''Second [[Battle of Badon]]'', somewhere in the [[Cotswold Hills]] which was a West Saxon victory against the [[Kingdom of Gwent]] and her local allies.\n* 670 The West Saxons led by [[Cenwealh]] capture central Somerset including the important religious centre at [[Glastonbury]].\n* 682 the West Saxons led by [[Centwine]] move westwards and defeat the West Welsh somewhere near the [[River Parrett]], driving them \"to the sea\".\n* c.685 The ''[[Brut y Tywysogion]]'' records a \"partial\" British victory in the south west with naval support from the [[Kingdom of Brittany]] that forces the West Saxons back from some of their gains.\n\n==Eighth Century==\n[[File:Wiglaf locations incl. Offa's Dyke.gif|frameless|right|241px]]\n\nThe Welsh territories in the south west (now Cornwall and little more) defend themselves and win a reprieve. The borders of modern Wales are broadly defined as Mercian expansion begins to slow.\n\n* 710 after defeating the West Welsh of [[Devon]], led by [[Geraint of Dumnonia]], and capturing the stronghold at [[Norton Fitzwarren]], King [[Ine of Wessex]] builds a fortress at [[Taunton]] to defend his conquests. In the course of the battle King Geraint is slain.\n* c.720 ''[[Battle of Hehil]]'', in [[Dumnonia]] where the Cornish Welsh with support from [[Rhodri Molwynog]] are victorious against Wessex bringing some peace to the beleaguered Cornish for almost a century. The ''[[Brut y Tywysogion|Brut]]'' records another battle \"won honorably\" in the same war between Rhodri and the Saxons.\n* c.720 The ''[[Battle of Pencoed]]'' in [[Morgannwg]], the ''Battle of Garth Maelog'', and \"another battle in Gwynedd\" are cited by the ''[[Brut y Tywysogion|Brut]]'' as \"British victories\", although explicitly separated from the war against the Saxons the same year.\n* 722 Ine of Wessex advances as far as the [[River Tamar]] but is defeated and withdraws. The West Saxon fortress at Taunton is destroyed.\n* 728 ''[[Battle of Carno Mountain]]'' in [[Kingdom of Gwent|Gwent]] where the Welsh forced the Anglo-Saxons back to the [[River Usk]] where many were drowned.\n* 733 ''Battle of Devawdan'', another Welsh victory.\n* 735 ''First Battle of Hereford'' where the Welsh are victorious after a long and bloody fight.\n* 743 an allied army of Mercians and West Saxons fight the Welsh. Possible construction of [[Wat's Dyke]].\n* 752 where [[Eadberht of Northumbria]] invades the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]] and conquered the territory of [[Kyle, Ayrshire|Kyle]].\n* 753 the West Saxons led by [[Cuthred]] fight the Welsh of [[Cornwall]]. The result is not known but the Cornish preserve their independence.\n* 755 the westward expansion of Wessex resumes. Over the next thirty or so years eastern and northern Devon is permanently conquered by Wessex.\n* 756 the Northumbrians led by Eadbert in alliance with the [[Picts]] invade the northern Welsh Kingdom of Strathclyde and defeat their king Dumnagual who is forced to submit thus becoming, for a while, a vassal of Northumbria. A second battle at Hereford is recorded as another Welsh victory in the ''Brut y Tywysogion''.\n* 765 where the Welsh invade Mercia and cause much devastation.\n* 769 Mercians campaign in Wales.\n* 760 ''[[Battle of Hereford]]'' is recorded as a Welsh victory against the Mercians led by [[Offa of Mercia]]. The Welsh were probably led by [[Elisedd ap Gwylog]] of Powys and his son [[Brochfael ap Elisedd]].\n* 780 the construction of [[Offa's Dyke]] begins. It appears this frontier ditch delineated an agreed frontier between Powys and Mercia.\n* 784 it is presumed that [[Exeter]] was captured by [[Cynewulf of Wessex]] following a siege. The Welsh invade Mercia again causing havoc.\n* 798 the Mercians led by [[Coenwulf of Mercia]] invade Wales but withdraw after killing [[Caradog ap Meirion]].\n\n==Ninth Century==\n\nDuring the first half of the century a reinvigorated Mercia almost conquers the rest of Wales. At the end of the century Viking raids on England bring the Welsh some respite.\n\n[[File:Wales 900-950 (Hywel the Good).svg|thumb|right|220px|Map of the extent of Hywel Dda's power {{legend|#aaeeff|Deheubarth, Hywel Dda's principality}}{{legend|#ffb380|Combine to form Morgannwg}}]]\n\n* 815 where [[Egbert of Wessex]] invades Cornwall and subdues the kingdom. 820 has also been suggested as a possible date for this \"invasion\"\n* 816 Mercians invade Powys.\n* 822 where [[Coelwulf of Mercia]] invades north Wales and captures [[Deganwy]] from Gwynedd and occupies the whole of Powys.\n* 825 ''Battle of Camelford'' between Wessex and the Cornish Welsh resulting in another West Saxon victory.\n* 828 the lands of Powys are liberated from Mercian occupation by [[Cyngen ap Cadell]]. The [[Pillar of Eliseg]] was probably commissioned at this time.\n* 830 where Egbert of Wessex invades Powys and forces Cyngen ap Cadell to submit. Egbert then withdraws his forces.\n* 838 ''Battle of Hingston Down'' in Cornwall where a combined force of Cornish and Danes were defeated by Wessex. \n* 853 where [[Burgred of Mercia]] overruns Powys. Cyngan ap Cadell abdicates and retires to [[Rome]] and his kingdom is annexed by [[Rhodri Mawr]] of Gwynedd.\n* 865 where Burgred of Mercia leads his forces against Rhodri Mawr and captures [[Anglesey]], briefly, from Gwynedd. Burgred is later forced to withdraw as his realm is invaded by the Vikings.\n* 878 the Welsh of Strathclyde in alliance with [[Kenneth MacAlpin]] invade northern Northumbria, currently at war with the Vikings, and liberate the [[Lothian]] region.\n* 890 at least some of the \"men of Strathclyde\" are forced to relocate to Gwynedd after their kingdom, much weakened by the Vikings, is overrun by Angles and Scots.\n\n==Tenth Century==\n\nA period of relative peace as [[Hywel Dda]] comes to dominate most of Wales and forms an alliance with [[Wessex]] against the Vikings who have destroyed the power of Mercia.\n\n* 925 the Cornish were evicted from Exeter by King [[Athelstan]] of England who subdues Cornwall and defines the border of Cornwall with England at the River Tamar.\n* 937 The [[Battle of Brunanburh]] AKA \"the Great War\" reputedly the bloodiest battle ever fought on British soil and where 5 kings died according to the Anglo-Saxon chroncles.  The Anglo-Saxon King Ethelstan and brother Edmund beat the combined armies of Olaf III Guthfrithson, the Norse\u2013Gael King of Dublin; Constantine II, King of Alba; and Owen I, King of Welsh Strathclyde. Though relatively little known today, it was called \"the greatest single battle in Anglo-Saxon history before the Battle of Hastings. Michael Livingston claimed that Brunanburh marks \"the moment when Englishness came of age.\"    Modern scholarship suggests Bromborough on the [[Wirral Peninsula]] is the site of the battle.\n* 940 when [[Idwal Foel]] of Gwynedd invaded [[England]] and was driven back and later deprived of his lands.\n* 945 following an English invasion of the [[Kingdom of the Cumbrians]], ruled by [[Dyfnwal ab Owain]], the English king is recorded to have granted or given it or a portion of it to the Scottish king. How much authority the Scots had over the Cumbrians is uncertain.\n* 962 King [[Edgar the Peaceful]] invades Gwynedd.\n* 985 [[Hywel ap Ieuaf]] of Gwynedd is killed fighting [[\u00c6lfhere, Ealdorman of Mercia]].\n\n==Eleventh Century==\n\nA united English kingdom of England is formed. The Welsh are united for a while under the aggressive [[Gruffudd ap Llywelyn]] but he is killed in renewed infighting before the [[Norman Conquest of England]]. The new Norman masters of England launch the Norman invasion of Wales and ravage the Welsh kingdoms.\n\n[[Image:Wales.post-Roman.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Post-Roman Welsh kingdoms.]]\n* 1039 ''Battle of Rhyd y Groes'' where [[Gruffudd ap Llywelyn]] \u2013 the recently crowned King of Gwynedd \u2013 ambushes a Mercian army led by [[Leofric of Mercia]] in [[Brycheiniog]], destroying them.\n* 1052 [[Gruffudd ap Llywelyn]] invades Herefordshire and sacks [[Leominster]].\n* 1055 [[Gruffudd ap Llywelyn]] allies with the exiled [[\u00c6lfgar, Earl of Mercia]] and ravages [[Herefordshire]].\n* 1062 [[Harold Godwinson]], the [[Earl of Wessex]] and his brother [[Tostig Godwinson|Tostig]] start a series of campaigns on behalf of the English crown against [[Gruffudd ap Llywelyn]] in retaliation for years of border raids. Gruffudd is killed.\n* 1067 Bleddyn and Rhiwallon ap Cynfyn, co rulers of Gwynedd, invade [[Herefordshire]] in support of [[Eadric the Wild]], an English rebel resisting the [[Norman Conquest]] of England.\n* 1067 The Normans invade the [[Kingdom of Gwent]] and conquer it driving king [[Caradog ap Gruffudd]] into exile.\n* 1073 The Normans invade Gwynedd and occupy [[Cantref Arfon|Arfon]].\n* 1085 The [[Normans]] launch a wholesale invasion of Wales ravaging Gwynedd and Powys.\n* 1091 The Normans conquer the kingdom of [[Morgannwg]] (formerly [[Glywysing]]) driving [[Iestyn ap Gwrgan]] into exile.\n* 1093 The Normans occupy [[Brycheiniog]] and ravage south Wales killing [[Rhys ap Tewdwr]], the king of [[Deheubarth]].\n* 1094 ''[[Aber Llech]]'' is the culmination of a national uprising across Wales that drives the Normans back into England with the exception of a few castles. Deheubarth makes territorial gains at the expense of other southern realms.\n* 1095 The Normans return but fail to draw the Welsh into battle.\n* 1098 The Normans occupy Gwynedd and Anglesey. They withdraw within the year.\n\n==Twelfth Century==\n\nCivil wars in England allow the Welsh kingdoms space to consolidate their positions. The end of the century sees a resurgent Gwynedd expand at the expense of her neighbours.\n\n[[File:Wales.medieval.jpg|frameless|right|241px]]\n* 1116 The Welsh of [[Deheubarth]] revolt against their Norman overlords.\n* 1134 Welsh raids into [[Shropshire]] destroying [[Caus Castle]].\n* 1136 Welsh Revolt against the Normans driving them from all Wales except the Lordship of [[Carmarthen]].

Following a failed landing on Anglesey, Henry II and Owain come to terms with Owain agreeing to withdraw to the west bank of the [[River Clwyd]].\n* 1159 [[Rhys ap Gruffudd]] of Deheubarth attacks Anglo-Norman castles and settlements in south Wales, capturing [[Llandovery]] in 1162.\n* 1163 [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] launches a military campaign in south Wales invading Deheubarth. He captures Rhys ap Gruffudd at [[Pencader, Carmarthenshire|Pencader]] and takes him to England. Rhys is restored to his lands in 1164 after he agrees to make [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] to Henry.\n* 1165 Rhys ap Gruffudd leads attacks on Anglo-Norman strongholds in south and west Wales. Gwynedd, Powys, Deheubarth and the smaller realms form an alliance against England. Henry II declares war and leads an invasion force from Shrewsbury through Powys and into Gwynedd. Henry is forced to withdraw after adverse weather conditions.\n* 1166 Rhys ap Gruffudd captures [[Cardigan Castle]] from the English crown.\n* 1167 Owain ap Gruffudd captures [[Rhuddlan Castle]] and [[Basingwerk]] advancing as far east as the [[River Dee (United Kingdom)|River Dee]].\n* 1185 Welsh raiders sack [[Cardiff]].\n* 1196 Full-scale war breaks out again. [[Hubert Walter]] invades Powys from Shrewsbury and places [[Welshpool]] under siege.\n* 1198 [[Painscastle|Battle of Painscastle]] where a Welsh army is destroyed by the English.\n\n==Thirteenth Century==\n\nThe primacy of Gwynedd continues up to the middle of the century when a \"Principality of Wales\" is proclaimed by [[Llywelyn Fawr]]. After a period of tumult following the death of Llywelyn's successor as prince, [[Dafydd ap Llywelyn]], Dafydd's nephew [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]] emerges as a major force in Welsh politics, assuming the title of prince of Wales in 1258 and establishing his authority in [[Powys]] and [[Deheubarth]]. Llywelyn's death in 1282, and the subsequent capture and execution of his brother and successor, [[Dafydd ap Gruffudd]], in 1283 signify the end of Welsh independence. The end of the century sees the annexation of Wales and the Edwardian Settlement.\n\n[[File:Wales 1234 (Marchia Wallie and Pura Wallia).svg|thumb|Wales 1234 (Marchia Wallie and Pura Wallia)<ref>[http://www.wrexham.gov.uk/english/heritage/medieval_exhibition/struggles.htm Wrexham County Borough Council: The Princes and the Marcher Lords]</ref><br><br>{{legend|#87de87|Pura Wallia (independent Wales)}}{{legend|#aaeeff|Lands gained by [[Llywelyn the Great]] in 1234}}{{legend|#ffb380|Marchia Wallia (lands ruled by the Marcher barons)}}]]\n* 1211 [[John, King of England|King John]] of England launches an invasion of Gwynedd from [[Chester]] but has to retreat without making gains. A second invasion later that year, this time from Shrewsbury, leaves the Welsh town of [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]] in ruins; John succeeds in securing the surrender of the prince of Gwynedd, [[Llywelyn Fawr]], who agrees to cede the [[Perfeddwlad]] to the English Crown as part of the peace terms.\n* 1215 Llywelyn Fawr in alliance with other princes attacks English holdings across Wales capturing [[Cardigan Castle]], [[Carmarthen Castle]], [[Kidwelly Castle]] and many other places. At a Welsh assembly (1216) Llywelyn is, to all intents and purposes, acknowledged as prince of Wales by the noblemen of Powys and Deheubarth. In 1218 the fighting finishes following a peace deal with England.\n* 1223 Marcher lord [[Hubert de Burgh]] starts a series of campaigns during which he retakes Carmarthen, Cardigan and [[Montgomery, Powys|Montgomery]].\n* 1240 With Llywelyn Fawr dead the English attack. Marcher lords retake the territorial gains made by Llywelyn.\n* 1241 Henry III invades Wales; [[Dafydd ap Llywelyn]] is forced to surrender (Aug). The subsequent peace agreement, the [[Treaty of Gwerneigron]], sees the English occupy the Perfeddwlad.\n* 1244 Dafydd declares war; several Welsh raids are mounted on the Wales-England border.\n* 1245 Dafydd's war intensifies. Gwynedd and her allies in Deheubarth and [[Powys Fadog]] make few gains in mid-Wales; however, [[Mold, Flintshire|Mold]] is recaptured by the Welsh (28 Mar). In August the English attack Gwynedd from [[Chester]]; defeated by Dafydd in battle, the invasion force advances as far as [[Deganwy]], where Henry is halted after heavy fighting. In the autumn a truce is agreed, and the English army withdraws to England. Dafydd's death in 1246 precipitates a new attack on Gwynedd from the south by Marcher lord [[Nicholas de Molis]] which compels Deheubarth and then Gwynedd to surrender. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Woodstock]], Gwynedd withdraws from Perfeddwlad.\n* 1256 Gwynedd, led by [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]], grandson of Llywelyn Fawr, invades and annexes the Perfeddwlad. Gwynedd annexes Brycheiniog, Maelienydd, Gwrtheyrnion and Builth (late 1250s). The [[Treaty of Montgomery]] (1267) allows Llywelyn to keep these gains. Deheubarth makes territorial gains in the south.\n* 1277 Llywelyn II is declared a rebel by [[Edward I]] and the English invade Wales; the '''First War of Welsh Independence''' begins. English armies from Carmarthen defeat the princes of Deheubarth, armies from Chester overwhelm [[Powys Fadog]] and armies from Shrewsbury retake Maelienydd, Builth, Brycheiniog and Gwrtheyrnion. In the [[Treaty of Aberconwy]] Llywelyn is confined to western Gwynedd and Powys Fadog and Deheubarth are broken up.\n* 1282 Gwynedd is drawn into a rebellion in the Perfeddwlad and goes to war against England.\n* 1282 The English invade Wales under Edward I. 16 June \u2013 [[Battle of Llandeilo]]; an English army in the south is routed, but Edward's forces continue to make slow progress for the rest of the summer. 6 November \u2013 [[Battle of Moel-y-don]]; an English army is routed on the banks of the [[Menia Straits]]. ''[[Battle of Orewin Bridge]]'' (11 Dec); Llywelyn II is killed in a chance ambush nearby at [[Cilmeri]]. [[Dafydd ap Gruffudd]] succeeds him.\n* 1283 The last remaining castles in Gwynedd are captured. The royal court of Wales withdraws to shelter in the mountains. [[Dafydd ap Gruffudd]] is captured in June and executed in Shrewsbury in October. Gwynedd is conquered. Resulting accords leave no part of Wales other than [[Powys Wenwynwyn]], [[Edeirnion]], [[Glyndyfrdwy]] and [[Dryslwyn Castle]] under native lordship.\n* 1287 [[Rhys ap Maredudd]] of Dryslwyn, a prince of Deheubarth incensed at his treatment by Edward I, leads attacks on English holdings in the south taking back the Deheubarth royal centre at [[Dinefwr Castle|Dinefwr]] and capturing the [[Ystrad Tywi]]. By 1288 he has lost all his holdings but remains a guerilla leader until his capture and execution in 1292.\n* 1294 a Welsh uprising led by [[Madog ap Llywelyn]], a junior member of the [[House of Aberffraw]] with estates in [[Anglesey]] sweeps north and central Wales briefly capturing [[Castell y Bere]], [[Carnarvon Castle]], [[Cardigan Castle]], [[Dinas Bran]] and [[Denbigh Castle]] among others. Madog proclaims himself prince of Wales.\n* 1295 ''Battle of Maes Moydog'' (5 Mar); Madog is defeated and the Welsh army destroyed. Madog is soon captured and imprisoned.\n\n==Fourteenth Century==\n\nA period of relative stability punctuated by two significant revolts.\n\n* 1314 Revolt breaks out in Glamorgan.\n* 1316 uprising in Gwent and Morgannwg led by [[Llywelyn Bren]] the lord of [[Senghennydd]] and a descendant of the kings of Morgannwg. Rebels put [[Caerphilly Castle]] under siege for six weeks and burn the town.

In the series, Howard is portrayed as cocky, arrogant and self-centered. However, many fans of the show believe that Howard is actually a good person. Fabian commented by saying \"You know, [[Saul Goodman|Jimmy [McGill]]] called Howard '[[Lord Vader]]' in the very first episode of ''Better Call Saul''. And when the lead character calls your character Lord Vader, the audience goes, 'Wow, what a dick that guy's gonna be.' Then everybody starts looking at everything that falls out of my mouth as evidence backing that claim up. And even when it goes in the opposite direction -- like at the end of Season 1, where it turns out I was sort of protecting Jimmy from [[Chuck McGill|Chuck [McGill]]], there is a bit of a hitch of 'Oh, maybe Howard's not so bad,' but as soon as I was quote-unquote being a dick to [[Kim Wexler|Kim [Wexler]]] in Season 2, they all got back on board and said, 'Yeah, he's Lord Vader.' I'm not complaining at all. It sort of parallels Howard's character in the show. Who's really supporting his point of view? Nobody. He's kind of on an island all to himself, saying 'This is not fair. This is not right. And it's also not my fault.'

The firm was originally established by Howard's father George and Chuck McGill, who later added Howard as a partner. When George died and Chuck became housebound as a result of his supposed [[electromagnetic hypersensitivity]], Howard became the firm's managing partner.\n\nWhen Chuck brings his younger brother Jimmy from Chicago to turn him away from his conman past, Howard agrees to employ Jimmy in HHM's mail room. Jimmy becomes impressed with Chuck's legal work as well as that of Kim Wexler, a law student who also works in the mail room, leading Jimmy to get his own law degree through correspondence school. After Jimmy passes the bar exam, Chuck secretly instructs Howard to deny him advancement at HHM. Unaware of Chuck's machinations, Jimmy becomes resentful towards Howard and starts his own moderately successful practice.\n\nWith Chuck unable to leave his house, Howard attempts to buy out his share of the partnership with a token payment. As Chuck's caregiver and ''[[de facto]]'' guardian, Jimmy refuses and demands that if Howard buys Chuck out, he pay the full value.\n\n=== Season 1 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 1)}}\nJimmy accepts a bribe from the Kettlemans, a married couple accused of embezzlement.  He spends the money on a personal appearance and wardrobe makeover and a billboard advertisement, both of which copy the signature looks of Howard and HHM. Howard persuades Kim to confront Jimmy over the imitation, but Jimmy refuses to stop.  Howard sues Jimmy for [[trademark infringement]], and Jimmy is ordered to have the advertisement removed within 48 hours, but uses the opportunity to stage a phony rescue of the billboard worker, which generates favorable publicity for Jimmy's law practice. \n\nWhen Jimmy delivers Chuck's newspapers the next day, he removes the local one so that Chuck will not see the story about the billboard rescue. Chuck braves the outdoors to take his neighbor's paper and sees the story about Jimmy's trick. The neighbor calls police, who break into Chuck's home and use a taser to subdue him. Chuck is rushed to the hospital, where the doctor tells Jimmy that Chuck's illness and recommends he be [[involuntary commitment|committed]] to a mental institution. Howard arrives and tells Jimmy the district attorney has agreed to drop the charges and allow Chuck to return home. Jimmy believes Howard does not want Chuck to be hospitalized so that Howard can continue attempting to buy out his partnership. Jimmy angrily tells Howard he intends to have Chuck committed, but tells Kim he said it only to irritate Howard.\n\nThe media attention from Jimmy's staged rescue causes him to start an elder law practice. When he uncovers possible fraud at the Sandpiper Crossing retirement home, Chuck helps him confirm the details. Jimmy and Chuck initiate a class-action suit, which becomes too large for them to handle alone, so Chuck suggests taking the case to HHM. Howard arranges for a meeting with Jimmy and Chuck at HHM and takes steps to accommodate Chuck's EHS. When Chuck arrives, the entire staff gives him a standing ovation. HHM agrees to take the case and Howard offers Jimmy twenty percent of the final judgment or settlement and an [[of counsel]] fee of $20,000, but makes clear that Jimmy will not continue to participate in the case.  Jimmy demands to know why Howard has always excluded him. Howard does not provide satisfactory answers, so Jimmy angrily refuses to hand off the case.\n\nKim confronts Howard about his treatment of Jimmy. Howard is initially resistant, but then tells Kim the truth -- that Chuck secretly asked him to block Jimmy. Jimmy figures out on his own that Chuck was responsible. He gives HHM the Sandpiper case, disengages from daily interaction with Chuck, and obtains Howard's agreement to continue Chuck's care. After seeing Jimmy's routine for himself, Howard is impressed with the time and effort Jimmy has put in and assigns Ernesto, an HHM employee, to continue caring for Chuck.\n\n=== Season 2 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 2)}}\nHHM finds that Jimmy and Chuck's assessment that Sandpiper has engaged in fraud across several states is correct. With the case becoming too big for HHM, Howard brings in another firm, Davis & Main (D&M).  Kim vouches for Jimmy to managing partner Clifford Main, and the D&M partners are impressed with Jimmy's knowledge of the case and rapport with clients, so they hire him as an associate. With responsibility for client outreach, Jimmy bypasses both Howard's and Clifford's oversight to attract more plaintiffs, including a melodramatic television commercial he produces himself and airs without approval. Howard, Clifford, and Chuck reprimand Jimmy, and Howard relegates Kim to entry-level document review work for failing to warn them. Jimmy quits D&M, while Kim attempts to regain her status by working her contacts to obtain a new client for HHM. She succeeds with Mesa Verde Bank, a local bank that is planning a multi-state expansion. Howard is happy to nhave the nbusiness, but denies Kim credit and keeps her working in document review. When Jimmy proposes they start a partnership, Kim counters with an offer to establish separate practices in a shared office. Jimmy accepts, so Kim quits HHM.\n\nHoward and Kim each work to obtain Mesa Verde as a client. The bank's president and legal counsel, Kevin and Paige, initially agree to hire Kim. Howard and Chuck meet with Kevin and Paige, and Chuck's damning of Kim with faint praise causes them to change their mind and retain HHM. When Chuck breaks down from the stress of appearing \"normal\" while meeting with Kevin and Paige, Jimmy tells Ernesto he will stay overnight with Chuck. Jimmy uses the opportunity to alter several documents in an application for a new Mesa Verde branch. At the next meeting of the banking board, the errors are uncovered. With Mesa Verde facing a loss of time and money because of the incorrect documents, Kevin and Paige leave HHM and retain Kim. \n\nChuck immediately suspects that Jimmy sabotaged him and works to prove it. He feigns a severe breakdown, which causes Jimmy to confess to his deceit. Unknown to Jimmy, Chuck recorded his confession.\n\n=== Season 3 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 3)}}\nChuck reveals Jimmy's confession to Howard, who wonders what Chuck can do with it, since it cannot be used in court. Chuck tells Howard the recording has a use. He first arranges for Ernesto to overhear a portion of the confession, then swears him to silence. Ernesto informs Kim about the recording, and Kim tells Jimmy. Jimmy breaks into Chuck's house and destroys the tape. Howard and a private investigator Chuck hired reveal themselves and tell Jimmy they are witnesses to his crimes, enabling Chuck to report Jimmy to the police. The prosecutor assigned to the case asures Chuck she takes the charges seriously and will press for jail time, but Chuck offers to drop the charges if Jimmy faces a bar association disciplinary hearing, which will likely result in disbarment. Jimmy agrees, but Kim and he plan a defense. At the hearing, Jimmy's cross-examination and revalation of Chuck's symptoms as psychosomatic causes Chuck to break down again. Jimmy law license is suspended for a year, but he is not disbarred. Howard tries to cheer up Chuck and tells himt hey should consider the suspension a victory, but Chuck becomes even more withdrawn.\n\nAs a cost-cutting move, Jimmy attempts to obtain a refund on his malpractice insurance premium. Informed that the policy has to stay in effect in case he is sued during his suspension, Jimmy feigns worry over Chuck's condition, but his knowing smile as he leaves indicates he is aware he has caused a problem for Chuck. Insurance company representatives inform Howard and Chuck that because of Chuck's condition, he will need to be constantly supervised by another attorney or HHM will face a steep increase in its premium. Chuck wants to fight, but Howard uses personal funds and loans to raise the first of three $3 million payments that will enable him to buy Chuck out. Chuck is forced to retire, and becomes even more reclusive. Jimmy tries to see Chuck and make amends, but Chuck tells Jimmy that Jimmy was never that important to him. After Jimmy leaves, Chuck angrily kicks a table several times, purposely knocking over a camping lantern and starting a fire.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Lantern |episode-link=Lantern (Better Call Saul) |series=Better Call Saul |series-link=Better Call Saul |network=AMC |date=June 19, 2017 |season=3 |number=10}}</ref>\n\n=== Season 4 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nChuck dies in the fire.

Afterward, he confesses to Jimmy and Kim that he may be responsible for Chuck's death because he forced Chuck to retire after the increase in HHM's malpractice insurance premium. Relieved that someone else is taking responsibility, Jimmy continues to conceal his role in causing the insurance premium to go up and regains his usual upbeat demeanor. Howard is burdened with guilt and HHM suffers from his inattention, the financial strain of paying out to Chuck's estate, and the loss of clients resulting from the firm's damaged reputation. As it becomes clear that Howard is floundering, Jimmy tries a \"tough love\" pep talk to rouse him to action. A year after Chuck's death, Howard gives a speech at the dedication for a new law library reading room in Chuck's honor, in which he indicates that HHM has recovered its financial footing and standing in Albuquerque's legal community.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Winner |episode-link=Winner (Better Call Saul) |series=Better Call Saul |series-link=Better Call Saul |network=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] |date=October 8, 2018 |season=4 |number=10}}</ref>\n\n=== Season 5 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\nHoward encounters Jimmy at the courthouse, now practicing under the name Saul Goodman.

Kim laughs at Howard and says she is insulted by the idea that she cannot decide for herself. Howard tells Kim Chuck really did know Jimmy better than anyone else. That evening, Kim tells Jimmy of her meeting with Howard and initially suggests continuing to harass him. As her idea becomes more realized, it evolves into a serious plan to sabotage Howard and force a resolution of the Sandpiper case, which will enable Jimmy to obtain his seven-figure share of the expected settlement.

In the series, Howard is portrayed as cocky, arrogant and self-centered. However, many fans of the show believe that Howard is actually a good person. Fabian commented by saying \"You know, [[Saul Goodman|Jimmy [McGill]]] called Howard '[[Lord Vader]]' in the very first episode of ''Better Call Saul''. And when the lead character calls your character Lord Vader, the audience goes, 'Wow, what a dick that guy's gonna be.' Then everybody starts looking at everything that falls out of my mouth as evidence backing that claim up. And even when it goes in the opposite direction -- like at the end of Season 1, where it turns out I was sort of protecting Jimmy from [[Chuck McGill|Chuck [McGill]]], there is a bit of a hitch of 'Oh, maybe Howard's not so bad,' but as soon as I was quote-unquote being a dick to [[Kim Wexler|Kim [Wexler]]] in Season 2, they all got back on board and said, 'Yeah, he's Lord Vader.' I'm not complaining at all. It sort of parallels Howard's character in the show. Who's really supporting his point of view? Nobody. He's kind of on an island all to himself, saying 'This is not fair. This is not right. And it's also not my fault.' We'll see where those chickens come home to roost, as they say.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/television/1670090/why-better-call-sauls-howard-isnt-really-a-villain-according-to-patrick-fabian |title=Why Better Call Saul's Howard Isn't Really A Villain, According To Patrick Fabian |date=June 14, 2017 |website=Cinema Blend |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200319214541/https://www.cinemablend.com/television/1670090/why-better-call-sauls-howard-isnt-really-a-villain-according-to-patrick-fabian |archive-date=March 19, 2020 |access-date=April 2, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://tv.avclub.com/is-better-call-saul-s-howard-hamlin-a-dick-or-not-1798163576 |title=Is Better Call Saul's Howard Hamlin a dick or not? |last=Teti |first=John |date=April 6, 2016 |website=[[The A.V.

The firm was originally established by Howard's father George and Chuck McGill, who later added Howard as a partner. When George died and Chuck became housebound as a result of his supposed [[electromagnetic hypersensitivity]], Howard became the firm's managing partner.\n\nWhen Chuck brings his younger brother Jimmy from Chicago to turn him away from his conman past, Howard agrees to employ Jimmy in HHM's mail room. Jimmy becomes impressed with Chuck's legal work as well as that of Kim Wexler, a law student who also works in the mail room, leading Jimmy to get his own law degree through correspondence school. After Jimmy passes the bar exam, Chuck secretly instructs Howard to deny him advancement at HHM. Unaware of Chuck's machinations, Jimmy becomes resentful towards Howard and starts his own moderately successful practice.\n\nWith Chuck unable to leave his house, Howard attempts to buy out his share of the partnership with a token payment. As Chuck's caregiver and ''[[de facto]]'' guardian, Jimmy refuses and demands that if Howard buys Chuck out, he pay the full value.\n\n=== Season 1 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 1)}}\nJimmy accepts a bribe from the Kettlemans, a married couple accused of embezzlement.  He spends the money on a personal appearance and wardrobe makeover and a billboard advertisement, both of which copy the signature looks of Howard and HHM. Howard persuades Kim to confront Jimmy over the imitation, but Jimmy refuses to stop.  Howard sues Jimmy for [[trademark infringement]], and Jimmy is ordered to have the advertisement removed within 48 hours, but uses the opportunity to stage a phony rescue of the billboard worker, which generates favorable publicity for Jimmy's law practice. \n\nWhen Jimmy delivers Chuck's newspapers the next day, he removes the local one so that Chuck will not see the story about the billboard rescue. Chuck braves the outdoors to take his neighbor's paper and sees the story about Jimmy's trick. The neighbor calls police, who break into Chuck's home and use a taser to subdue him. Chuck is rushed to the hospital, where the doctor tells Jimmy that Chuck's illness and recommends he be [[involuntary commitment|committed]] to a mental institution. Howard arrives and tells Jimmy the district attorney has agreed to drop the charges and allow Chuck to return home. Jimmy believes Howard does not want Chuck to be hospitalized so that Howard can continue attempting to buy out his partnership. Jimmy angrily tells Howard he intends to have Chuck committed, but tells Kim he said it only to irritate Howard.\n\nThe media attention from Jimmy's staged rescue causes him to start an elder law practice. When he uncovers possible fraud at the Sandpiper Crossing retirement home, Chuck helps him confirm the details. Jimmy and Chuck initiate a class-action suit, which becomes too large for them to handle alone, so Chuck suggests taking the case to HHM. Howard arranges for a meeting with Jimmy and Chuck at HHM and takes steps to accommodate Chuck's EHS. When Chuck arrives, the entire staff gives him a standing ovation. HHM agrees to take the case and Howard offers Jimmy twenty percent of the final judgment or settlement and an [[of counsel]] fee of $20,000, but makes clear that Jimmy will not continue to participate in the case.  Jimmy demands to know why Howard has always excluded him. Howard does not provide satisfactory answers, so Jimmy angrily refuses to hand off the case.\n\nKim confronts Howard about his treatment of Jimmy. Howard is initially resistant, but then tells Kim the truth -- that Chuck secretly asked him to block Jimmy. Jimmy figures out on his own that Chuck was responsible. He gives HHM the Sandpiper case, disengages from daily interaction with Chuck, and obtains Howard's agreement to continue Chuck's care. After seeing Jimmy's routine for himself, Howard is impressed with the time and effort Jimmy has put in and assigns Ernesto, an HHM employee, to continue caring for Chuck.\n\n=== Season 2 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 2)}}\nHHM finds that Jimmy and Chuck's assessment that Sandpiper has engaged in fraud across several states is correct. With the case becoming too big for HHM, Howard brings in another firm, Davis & Main (D&M).  Kim vouches for Jimmy to managing partner Clifford Main, and the D&M partners are impressed with Jimmy's knowledge of the case and rapport with clients, so they hire him as an associate. With responsibility for client outreach, Jimmy bypasses both Howard's and Clifford's oversight to attract more plaintiffs, including a melodramatic television commercial he produces himself and airs without approval. Howard, Clifford, and Chuck reprimand Jimmy, and Howard relegates Kim to entry-level document review work for failing to warn them. Jimmy quits D&M, while Kim attempts to regain her status by working her contacts to obtain a new client for HHM. She succeeds with Mesa Verde Bank, a local bank that is planning a multi-state expansion. Howard is happy to nhave the nbusiness, but denies Kim credit and keeps her working in document review. When Jimmy proposes they start a partnership, Kim counters with an offer to establish separate practices in a shared office. Jimmy accepts, so Kim quits HHM.\n\nHoward and Kim each work to obtain Mesa Verde as a client. The bank's president and legal counsel, Kevin and Paige, initially agree to hire Kim. Howard and Chuck meet with Kevin and Paige, and Chuck's damning of Kim with faint praise causes them to change their mind and retain HHM. When Chuck breaks down from the stress of appearing \"normal\" while meeting with Kevin and Paige, Jimmy tells Ernesto he will stay overnight with Chuck. Jimmy uses the opportunity to alter several documents in an application for a new Mesa Verde branch. At the next meeting of the banking board, the errors are uncovered. With Mesa Verde facing a loss of time and money because of the incorrect documents, Kevin and Paige leave HHM and retain Kim. \n\nChuck immediately suspects that Jimmy sabotaged him and works to prove it. He feigns a severe breakdown, which causes Jimmy to confess to his deceit. Unknown to Jimmy, Chuck recorded his confession.\n\n=== Season 3 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 3)}}\nChuck reveals Jimmy's confession to Howard, who wonders what Chuck can do with it, since it cannot be used in court. Chuck tells Howard the recording has a use. He first arranges for Ernesto to overhear a portion of the confession, then swears him to silence. Ernesto informs Kim about the recording, and Kim tells Jimmy. Jimmy breaks into Chuck's house and destroys the tape. Howard and a private investigator Chuck hired reveal themselves and tell Jimmy they are witnesses to his crimes, enabling Chuck to report Jimmy to the police. The prosecutor assigned to the case asures Chuck she takes the charges seriously and will press for jail time, but Chuck offers to drop the charges if Jimmy faces a bar association disciplinary hearing, which will likely result in disbarment. Jimmy agrees, but Kim and he plan a defense. At the hearing, Jimmy's cross-examination and revalation of Chuck's symptoms as psychosomatic causes Chuck to break down again. Jimmy law license is suspended for a year, but he is not disbarred. Howard tries to cheer up Chuck and tells himt hey should consider the suspension a victory, but Chuck becomes even more withdrawn.\n\nAs a cost-cutting move, Jimmy attempts to obtain a refund on his malpractice insurance premium. Informed that the policy has to stay in effect in case he is sued during his suspension, Jimmy feigns worry over Chuck's condition, but his knowing smile as he leaves indicates he is aware he has caused a problem for Chuck. Insurance company representatives inform Howard and Chuck that because of Chuck's condition, he will need to be constantly supervised by another attorney or HHM will face a steep increase in its premium. Chuck wants to fight, but Howard uses personal funds and loans to raise the first of three $3 million payments that will enable him to buy Chuck out. Chuck is forced to retire, and becomes even more reclusive. Jimmy tries to see Chuck and make amends, but Chuck tells Jimmy that Jimmy was never that important to him. After Jimmy leaves, Chuck angrily kicks a table several times, purposely knocking over a camping lantern and starting a fire.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Lantern |episode-link=Lantern (Better Call Saul) |series=Better Call Saul |series-link=Better Call Saul |network=AMC |date=June 19, 2017 |season=3 |number=10}}</ref>\n\n=== Season 4 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nChuck dies in the fire.

Afterward, he confesses to Jimmy and Kim that he may be responsible for Chuck's death because he forced Chuck to retire after the increase in HHM's malpractice insurance premium. Relieved that someone else is taking responsibility, Jimmy continues to conceal his role in causing the insurance premium to go up and regains his usual upbeat demeanor. Howard is burdened with guilt and HHM suffers from his inattention, the financial strain of paying out to Chuck's estate, and the loss of clients resulting from the firm's damaged reputation. As it becomes clear that Howard is floundering, Jimmy tries a \"tough love\" pep talk to rouse him to action. A year after Chuck's death, Howard gives a speech at the dedication for a new law library reading room in Chuck's honor, in which he indicates that HHM has recovered its financial footing and standing in Albuquerque's legal community.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Winner |episode-link=Winner (Better Call Saul) |series=Better Call Saul |series-link=Better Call Saul |network=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] |date=October 8, 2018 |season=4 |number=10}}</ref>\n\n=== Season 5 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\nHoward encounters Jimmy at the courthouse, now practicing under the name Saul Goodman.

Howard tells Kim about Jimmy's recent harassment campaign against him and blames Jimmy for Kim's decision. Kim laughs at Howard and says she is insulted by the idea that she cannot decide for herself. Howard tells Kim that Chuck really did know Jimmy better than anyone else. That evening, Kim tells Jimmy of Howard's rant and initially suggests continuing Jimmy's college-style pranks, but her ideas become more realized, culminating in a serious plan to sabotage Howard and force a resolution of the Sandpiper case, which will enable Jimmy to obtain his seven-figure share of the expected settlement. Jimmy counsels against it, but Kim shows that she is serious about undermining Howard.<ref name=\"s5e10\">{{Cite episode |title=Something Unforgivable |episode-link=Something Unforgivable |series=Better Call Saul |series-link=Better Call Saul |network=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] |date=April 20, 2020 |season=5 |number=10}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Better Call Saul}}\n\n[[Category:Better Call Saul characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional American lawyers]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2015]]\n", "name_user": "Billmckern", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSeason 5", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Hamlin"}

The network features a broad mix of live action and animated children's programs distributed to PBS by independent companies and select member stations, which are designed for improving the early literacy, math, and social-emotional skills of young children ages 2 to 11.<ref name=\"tc\">{{cite news|last1=Perez|first1=Sarah|title=PBS KIDS debuts a new channel and live TV service, available via web and mobile|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/16/pbs-kids-debuts-a-new-channel-and-live-tv-service-available-via-web-and-mobile/|accessdate=January 25, 2017|work=TechCrunch|date=January 16, 2017}}</ref> Some PBS member stations, such as [[KLCS]] in [[Los Angeles]] maintain their own locally programmed PBS Kids feed, that is independent from the nationally sourced feed.\n\n===Network history===\nOn September 6, 1999, PBS launched the PBS Kids Channel in several markets, in conjunction with the introduction of the PBS Kids brand to provide a unified branding for the service's children's programming offerings. The channel was launched on 33 PBS member stations: 19 of which offered PBS Kids Channel as a cable-only service, 9 which carried the channel on their digital broadcast signals in standard-definition, and 3 which carried simulcasts of the channel on their analog signals. Of the initial 27 affiliates, 16 of them planned to begin carrying PBS Kids Channel during the fall of 1999, with 11 additional stations choosing to debut it that winter.<ref name=ct3/>\n\nFCC requirements mandated [[Satellite television|satellite]] providers to set aside 4% of their available channel space for noncommercial educational and informational programming. With these providers limited to offering one such service per programmer, PBS had put forth PBS Kids as a prospective channel to fulfill this mandate.<ref>{{cite news| last1=Behrens |first1=Steve|last2=Bedford |first2=Karen Everhart|title=DirecTV okays channels from PBS and ITVS|url=http://current.org/wp-content/uploads/archive-site/in/in923d.html|accessdate=February 21, 2017|work=Current|publisher=American University School of Communication|date=December 13, 1999}}</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of DirecTV's decision not to renew its funding agreement with the channel, which ended in the third quarter of 2005,<ref name=ct4/> PBS decided to shut down the network on September 26 of that year.{{Failed verification|date=April 2017}} PBS Kids Channel was effectively supplanted on that date by [[Universal Kids|PBS Kids Sprout]], an advertiser-supported cable and satellite channel that PBS developed in a [[joint venture]] with [[HIT Entertainment]], [[Sesame Workshop]], and [[Comcast]]. PBS gave licensees an option to sign on Sprout promoters, giving them cross-promotional and monetary benefits in exchange for giving up the ability to carry a competing preschool-targeted channel. 80 stations, making up about half of the member stations participants, signed up to be promoters; most of the remaining stations opted to develop independent children's programming services featuring programs distributed by PBS and through outside distributors such as [[American Public Television]] to fill space on [[digital subchannel]]s that formerly served as PBS Kids Channel members. Many of the member stations that launched children's-focused subchannel or cable-only services reduced the amount of sourced programming from PBS Kids carried on their primary channel to a few hours of their weekday daytime schedules, in order to program more adult-targeted fare during the afternoon.<ref name=crt0/>\n\nPBS relaunched the PBS Kids network on January 16, 2017.<ref name=vty/> Structured as a multi-platform service, it was made available for distribution to digital subchannels of participating PBS member stations, initially launching on 73 member stations (counting those operated as [[state network|subregional PBS member networks]]), with an additional 34 agreeing to begin carrying the network at a later date.{{Failed verification|date=April 2017}} A live stream of the channel was also added to the PBS Kids website and video app upon the channel's debut, which will eventually allow viewers to toggle from the program being aired to a related educational game extending the interactivity introduced by ''Sesame Street''. The network is counterprogrammed from the PBS Kids block, so that the same program would not be shown on either simultaneously. PBS Kids 24/7 mainly features double-runs of existing series on PBS Kids' schedule (including some not carried on the primary channels of certain member stations); as such, no additional programs had to be acquired to help fill the channel's schedule.<ref name=ks/> On April 21, 2017, the network launched \"PBS Kids Family Night,\" a weekly block on Friday evenings (with encore airings on Saturday and Sunday evenings) that showcase themed programming, premieres or special \"movie-length\" episodes of new and existing PBS Kids children's programs.<ref name=\"tc\"/><ref name=vty/><ref name=ks/><ref>{{cite news|title=PBS Is Creating a Channel Exclusively for Children|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/23/business/media/pbs-is-creating-a-channel-exclusively-for-children.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FPublic%20Broadcasting%20Service&action=click&contentCollection=timestopics&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=4&pgtype=collection&_r=0|author=John Koblin|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=February 22, 2016|accessdate=March 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Affiliates===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The channel was launched on 33 PBS member stations: 19 of which offered PBS Kids Channel as a cable-only service, 9 which carried the channel on their digital broadcast signals in standard-definition, and 3 which carried simulcasts of the channel on their analog signals. Of the initial 27 affiliates, 16 of them planned to begin carrying PBS Kids Channel during the fall of 1999, with 11 additional stations choosing to debut it that winter.<ref name=ct3/>\n\nFCC requirements mandated [[Satellite television|satellite]] providers to set aside 4% of their available channel space for noncommercial educational and informational programming. With these providers limited to offering one such service per programmer, PBS had put forth PBS Kids as a prospective channel to fulfill this mandate.<ref>{{cite news| last1=Behrens |first1=Steve|last2=Bedford |first2=Karen Everhart|title=DirecTV okays channels from PBS and ITVS|url=http://current.org/wp-content/uploads/archive-site/in/in923d.html|accessdate=February 21, 2017|work=Current|publisher=American University School of Communication|date=December 13, 1999}}</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of DirecTV's decision not to renew its funding agreement with the channel, which ended in the third quarter of 2005,<ref name=ct4/> PBS decided to shut down the network on September 26 of that year.{{Failed verification|date=April 2017}} PBS Kids Channel was effectively supplanted on that date by [[Universal Kids|PBS Kids Sprout]], an advertiser-supported cable and satellite channel that PBS developed in a [[joint venture]] with [[HIT Entertainment]], [[Sesame Workshop]], and [[Comcast]]. PBS gave licensees an option to sign on Sprout promoters, giving them cross-promotional and monetary benefits in exchange for giving up the ability to carry a competing preschool-targeted channel. 80 stations, making up about half of the member stations participants, signed up to be promoters; most of the remaining stations opted to develop independent children's programming services featuring programs distributed by PBS and through outside distributors such as [[American Public Television]] to fill space on [[digital subchannel]]s that formerly served as PBS Kids Channel members. Many of the member stations that launched children's-focused subchannel or cable-only services reduced the amount of sourced programming from PBS Kids carried on their primary channel to a few hours of their weekday daytime schedules, in order to program more adult-targeted fare during the afternoon.<ref name=crt0/>\n\nPBS relaunched PBS Kids on January 16, 2017.<ref name=vty/> Structured as a multi-platform service, it was made available for distribution to digital subchannels of participating PBS member stations, initially launching on 73 member stations (counting those operated as [[state network|subregional PBS member networks]]), with an additional 34 agreeing to begin carrying the network at a later date.{{Failed verification|date=April 2017}} A live stream of the channel was also added to the PBS Kids website and video app upon the channel's debut, which will eventually allow viewers to toggle from the program being aired to a related educational game extending the interactivity introduced by ''Sesame Street''. The network is counterprogrammed from the PBS Kids block, so that the same program would not be shown on either simultaneously. PBS Kids 24/7 mainly features double-runs of existing series on PBS Kids' schedule (including some not carried on the primary channels of certain member stations); as such, no additional programs had to be acquired to help fill the channel's schedule.<ref name=ks/> On April 21, 2017, the network launched \"PBS Kids Family Night,\" a weekly block on Friday evenings (with encore airings on Saturday and Sunday evenings) that showcase themed programming, premieres or special \"movie-length\" episodes of new and existing PBS Kids children's programs.<ref name=\"tc\"/><ref name=vty/><ref name=ks/><ref>{{cite news|title=PBS Is Creating a Channel Exclusively for Children|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/23/business/media/pbs-is-creating-a-channel-exclusively-for-children.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FPublic%20Broadcasting%20Service&action=click&contentCollection=timestopics&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=4&pgtype=collection&_r=0|author=John Koblin|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=February 22, 2016|accessdate=March 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Affiliates===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The propagating electromagnetic waves are confined inside the substrate because of the two metallic layers on the two faces of the substrate and the two rows of metallic vias connecting them.]]\n\nA '''Substrate integrated waveguide (SIW)''' (also known as '''post-wall waveguide''' or '''laminated waveguide''') is a synthetic [[Waveguide (radio frequency)|rectangular electromagnetic waveguide]] formed in a [[dielectric]] substrate by densely arraying metallized posts or [[Via (electronics)|via-hole]]s which connect the upper and lower metal plates of the substrate. The waveguide can be easily fabricated with low-cost mass-production using [[Through-hole technology|through-hole techniques]] where the post walls consists of [[via fence]]s. SIW is known to have similar guided wave and mode characteristics to conventional rectangular waveguide with equivalent [[guide wavelength]].\n\nSince the emergence of new communication technologies in the 1990s, there has been an increasing need for high-performance millimeter-wave systems. These need to be reliable, low-cost, compact, and compatible with high-frequencies. Unfortunately, above 10&nbsp;GHz, the well known [[microstrip]] and [[coplanar waveguide|coplanar lines]] technologies cannot be used because they have high insertion and radiation losses at these frequencies. The [[Waveguide (radio frequency)|rectangular waveguide]] topology can overcome these issues as it offers an excellent immunity against radiation losses and presents low insertion losses. But in their classical form, rectangular waveguide is not compatible with the miniaturization required by modern applications.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Ke Wu|last2=Desiandes|first2=D.|last3=Cassivi|first3=Y.|date=2003|title=The substrate integrated circuits - a new concept for high-frequency electronics and optoelectronics|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1246173/|journal=6th International Conference on Telecommunications in Modern Satellite, Cable and Broadcasting Service, 2003.

Using a single substrate guarantees a limited volume and a simplicity of manufacture, while the rectangular cross-section of the line provides the advantages of the waveguide topology in terms of losses.\n\n== Principles of SIW ==\n\n[[File:SIW horizontal.png|alt=Horizontal cross-section of a classical substrate integrated waveguide.|thumb|Horizontal cross-section of a substrate integrated waveguide. The propagating electromagnetic waves are confined inside the substrate because of the two metallic layers on the two faces of the substrate and the two rows of metallic vias connecting them. The center-to-center distance of two successive vias is <math display=\"inline\">s</math>, their diameter is <math display=\"inline\">d</math> and the center-to-center distance between the two rows of vias is <math display=\"inline\">a</math>. The effective width <math display=\"inline\">a_e</math>, computed from <math display=\"inline\">a</math>, <math display=\"inline\">d</math> and <math display=\"inline\">s</math> is also presented.]]\n\n=== Geometry ===\n\nA SIW is composed of a thin dielectric substrate covered on both faces by a metallic layer. The substrate embeds two parallel rows of metallic [[via (electronics)|via-holes]] delimiting the wave propagation area. The organization of the vias and the geometric parameters are described in the attached figure.\n\nThe width of a SIW is the distance <math>a</math> between its two vias rows, which is defined from center-to-center. An [[#Effective width|effective width]] <math>a_e</math> may be used to characterize more precisely the wave propagation. The distance between two successive vias of the same row is <math>s</math>, and the vias diameter is denoted by <math>d</math>.\n\n=== Transverse magnetic propagation modes ===\n\nIn classical solid-walled rectangular waveguide, the general formulation of propagation involves a superposition of [[Transverse mode|transverse electric]] (TE) and [[Transverse mode|transverse magnetic]] (TM) modes. Each of these is associated with particular fields and currents. In the case of TM modes, the current in the vertical walls is longitudinal, i.e. parallel to the propagation axis, usually denoted as <math>z</math>. Then, given the vertical geometry of the vias, it is impossible for such modes to appear in SIW's: the electrical current cannot propagate from via to via. Only TE modes are able to propagate through SIW.\n\nEach mode appears above a precise cut-off frequency determined by the waveguide dimensions and the filling medium. For TM modes, decreasing the waveguide thickness (usually denoted as <math>b</math>) increases the cut-off frequency with <math>1/b</math>. In the case of SIW, the thickness is so low that the cut-off frequency of TM modes is much higher than the dominant mode.\n\n=== Effective width ===\n\nOne of the objectives of the SIW geometry is to reproduce the characteristic propagation modes of rectangular waveguides inside a thin template. The width <math>a</math> of the waveguide is an essential parameter of those modes. In the typical SIW geometry, <math>a</math> is the distance between the two vias rows from center-to-center (see figure).

The goal of such transitions between two different topologies of TL is to excite the correct transmission mode in the SIW cavity with the minimum loss of power and on the broadest possible frequency range.\n\nRapidly after the presentation of the concept of SIW by [[Ke Wu]], two different transitions were mainly used.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> First, the tapered transition allowing to convert a microstrip line into a SIW and secondly a transition between a coplanar line and a SIW (see attached figure). The tapered transition from microstrip to SIW is useful for thin substrates. In this case, the radiation losses associated with microstrip lines are not too significant. This transition is massively used and different optimizing process have been proposed.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rayas-Sanchez|first=Jose E.|last2=Gutierrez-Ayala|first2=Vladimir|date=2008|title=A general EM-based design procedure for single-layer substrate integrated waveguide interconnects with microstrip transitions|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4632999/|journal=2008 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest|pages=983\u2013986|doi=10.1109/MWSYM.2008.4632999}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Deslandes|first=Dominic|date=2010|title=Design equations for tapered microstrip-to-Substrate Integrated Waveguide transitions|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5517884/|journal=2010 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium|pages=704\u2013707|doi=10.1109/MWSYM.2010.5517884}}</ref> But this is not applicable to thick substrates where leakages are important. In that situation, a coplanar excitation of the SIW is recommended. The drawback of the coplanar transition is the narrower bandwidth.\n\nThese two kinds of transitions involve lines that are embedded in the same substrate, which is not the case for [[Coaxial cable|coaxial lines]]. There exists no direct transition between a coaxial line and a SIW: an other [[Planar transmission line|planar line]] have to be used to convert properly the coaxial [[Transverse mode|TEM propagation modes]] to the TE modes in SIW.\n\nSeveral studies have been carried out to optimize the transition between topologies without being able to determine a universal rule making it possible to draw the absolute transition.

However, for [[rectangular waveguide]]s, the attenuation due to radiations and substrate [[Electrical conductivity|conductivity]] is negligible. Indeed, usually, the substrate is an insulator such that <math>\\alpha_G \\simeq 0</math>. In the same way, if the wall thickness is much thicker than the skin depth of the signal, no radiation will appear. This is in fact one of the advantages of closed waveguides compared to open lines such as microstrips.\n\nThe SIWs show comparable or lower losses compared the other traditional planar structures like microstrip or coplanar lines especially at high frequencies.<ref name=\":4\" /> If the substrate is thick enough, the losses are dominated by the dielectric behavior of the substrate.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== Attenuation due to conduction currents ===\nPart of the signal attenuation is due to the [[Current density|surface current density]] flowing through the metallic walls of the waveguide. These currents are induced by the propagating [[electromagnetic field]]s. These losses may also be named ohmic losses for obvious reasons. They are linked to the finite conductivity of the metals: the better the conduction, the lower the losses. The power lost per unit length <math>P_l</math> can be calculated by integrating the current densities <math>J_s</math> on a path <math>C</math> enclosing the waveguide walls :<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n<math display=\"block\">P_l = \\frac{1}{2} R_s \\int_C |{J_s}|^2 dl.</math>\n\nIt can be shown that in a classical rectangular waveguide, the attenuation of the dominant mode <math>\\text{TE}_{10}</math> due to conduction currents is given, in [[Neper]]s per [[Metre|meter]], by<math display=\"block\" id=\"alpha_c_expression\">\\alpha_C = \\frac{R_s}{a^3 b \\beta k \\eta}  \\left( 2 b \\pi^2 + a^3 k^2 \\right) =  \\frac{R_s}{\\beta k \\eta} \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi^2}{a^3 } + \\frac{k^2}{b} \\right)</math>where\n\n* <math>a</math> is the width of the waveguide\n* <math>b</math> its height\n* <math>\\eta = \\sqrt{\\mu / \\epsilon}</math> the [[wave impedance]] \n* <math>k = \\omega \\sqrt{\\mu \\epsilon}</math> the [[wave vector]]\n* <math>\\delta = 1 / \\sqrt{\\pi f \\mu \\sigma}</math> the [[Skin Depth|skin depth]] in the conductor \n* <math>R_s = \\frac{1}{\\delta \\sigma} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega \\mu}{2 \\sigma}}</math> is the [[sheet resistance]] (of surface impedance).\n\nIt is noticeable that <math>\\alpha_C</math> is directly linked to the substrate thickness <math>b</math>: the thinner the substrate, the higher the conduction losses. This can be explained keeping in mind that this ohmic losses are determined by integrating the current density on a path enclosing the waveguide walls.\n\nOn the top and bottom horizontal metallic plates, the current is scaled with <math>1/b</math>, due to the modification of the field intensity on these plates: when <math>b</math> increases, the field intensity decreases as well as the currents.

These need to be reliable, low-cost, compact, and compatible with high-frequencies. Unfortunately, above 10&nbsp;GHz, the well known [[microstrip]] and [[coplanar waveguide|coplanar lines]] technologies cannot be used because they have high insertion and radiation losses at these frequencies. The [[Waveguide (radio frequency)|rectangular waveguide]] topology can overcome these issues as it offers an excellent immunity against radiation losses and presents low insertion losses.

The substrate embeds two parallel rows of metallic [[via (electronics)|via-holes]] delimiting the wave propagation area. The organization of the vias and the geometric parameters are described in the attached figure.\n\nThe width of a SIW is the distance <math>a</math> between its two vias rows, which is defined from center-to-center. An [[#Effective width|effective width]] <math>a_e</math> may be used to characterize more precisely the wave propagation. The distance between two successive vias of the same row is <math>s</math>, and the vias diameter is denoted by <math>d</math>.\n\n=== Transverse magnetic propagation modes ===\n\nIn classical solid-walled rectangular waveguide, the general formulation of propagation involves a superposition of [[Transverse mode|transverse electric]] (TE) and [[Transverse mode|transverse magnetic]] (TM) modes. Each of these is associated with particular fields and currents. In the case of TM modes, the current in the vertical walls is longitudinal, i.e. parallel to the propagation axis, usually denoted as <math>z</math>. Then, given the vertical geometry of the vias, it is impossible for such modes to appear in SIW's: the electrical current cannot propagate from via to via. Only TE modes are able to propagate through SIW.\n\nEach mode appears above a precise cut-off frequency determined by the waveguide dimensions and the filling medium. For TM modes, decreasing the waveguide thickness (usually denoted as <math>b</math>) increases the cut-off frequency with <math>1/b</math>. In the case of SIW, the thickness is so low that the cut-off frequency of TM modes is much higher than the dominant mode.\n\n=== Effective width ===\n\nOne of the objectives of the SIW geometry is to reproduce the characteristic propagation modes of rectangular waveguides inside a thin template. The width <math>a</math> of the waveguide is an essential parameter of those modes. In the typical SIW geometry, <math>a</math> is the distance between the two vias rows from center-to-center (see figure). Due to the vias geometry, this distance cannot be utilized directly; because of the space between successive vias and their circular shape, the signal inside the guide does not behave exactly as it would in a perfectly rectangular waveguide of the same width.\n\nTo apply waveguide theory to SIWs, an effective width <math>a_\\text{eff}</math>can be used.

This transition is massively used and different optimizing process have been proposed.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rayas-Sanchez|first=Jose E.|last2=Gutierrez-Ayala|first2=Vladimir|date=2008|title=A general EM-based design procedure for single-layer substrate integrated waveguide interconnects with microstrip transitions|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4632999/|journal=2008 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest|pages=983\u2013986|doi=10.1109/MWSYM.2008.4632999}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Deslandes|first=Dominic|date=2010|title=Design equations for tapered microstrip-to-Substrate Integrated Waveguide transitions|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5517884/|journal=2010 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium|pages=704\u2013707|doi=10.1109/MWSYM.2010.5517884}}</ref> But this is not applicable to thick substrates where leakages are important. In that situation, a coplanar excitation of the SIW is recommended. The drawback of the coplanar transition is the narrower bandwidth.\n\nThese two kinds of transitions involve lines that are embedded in the same substrate, which is not the case for coaxial lines. There exists no direct transition between a coaxial line and a SIW: an other planar line have to be used to convert properly the coaxial TEM propagation modes to the TE modes in SIW.\n\nSeveral studies have been carried out to optimize the transition between topologies without being able to determine a universal rule making it possible to draw the absolute transition. The architecture, the frequency range, the used materials, etc. are examples of parameters that make specific the design procedure.<ref name=\":4\"/><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Xiao-Ping|last2=Wu|first2=Ke|date=2009|title=Low-loss ultra-wideband transition between conductor-backed coplanar waveguide and substrate integrated waveguide|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5165705/|journal=2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest|pages=349\u2013352|doi=10.1109/MWSYM.2009.5165705}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Sunho|last2=Jung|first2=Sangwoon|last3=Lee|first3=Hai-Young|date=2008|title=Ultra-Wideband CPW-to-Substrate Integrated Waveguide Transition Using an Elevated-CPW Section|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4666756/|journal=IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters|volume=18|issue=11|pages=746\u2013748|doi=10.1109/LMWC.2008.2005230|issn=1531-1309}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Taringou|first=Farzaneh|last2=Bornemann|first2=Jens|date=2011|title=New substrate-integrated to coplanar waveguide transition|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6101767/|journal=2011 41st European Microwave Conference|pages=428\u2013431|doi=10.23919/EuMC.2011.6101767}}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align    = center   \n| direction = horizontal\n| image1   = SIW tapered transition.svg\n| caption1 = Transition from microstrip to SIW\n| width1   = 200\n| image2   = SIW transition CPWG.svg\n| caption2 = Transition from a coplanar line to a SIW\n| width2   = 200\n| footer   = Examples of transitions from coplanar and microstrip lines to SIW.

The most common terms are the following:<ref name=\":3\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.microwaves101.com/encyclopedias/waveguide-loss|title=Microwaves101 {{!}} Waveguide Loss|website=www.microwaves101.com|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n\n*<math>\\alpha_C</math> : the loss due to the external metal conductivity\n*<math>\\alpha_D\n</math> : the loss due to loss tangent of the dielectric medium filling the waveguide\n*<math>\\alpha_G</math> : the loss due to conductivity of the dielectric medium filling the waveguide\n*<math>\\alpha_R</math> : the loss due to radiation.\n\nThis decomposition is valid for all kind of [[transmission line]]s. However, for [[rectangular waveguide]]s, the attenuation due to radiations and substrate [[Electrical conductivity|conductivity]] is negligible. Indeed, usually, the substrate is an insulator such that <math>\\alpha_G \\simeq 0</math>. In the same way, if the wall thickness is much thicker than the skin depth of the signal, no radiation will appear. This is in fact one of the advantages of closed waveguides compared to open lines such as microstrips.\n\nThe SIWs show comparable or lower losses compared the other traditional planar structures like microstrip or coplanar lines especially at high frequencies.<ref name=\":4\" /> If the substrate is thick enough, the losses are dominated by the dielectric behavior of the substrate.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== Attenuation due to conduction currents ===\nPart of the signal attenuation is due to the [[Current density|surface current density]] flowing through the metallic walls of the waveguide. These currents are induced by the propagating [[electromagnetic field]]s. These losses may also be named ohmic losses for obvious reasons. They are linked to the finite conductivity of the metals: the better the conduction, the lower the losses. The power lost per unit length <math>P_l</math> can be calculated by integrating the current densities <math>J_s</math> on a path <math>C</math> enclosing the waveguide walls :<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n<math display=\"block\">P_l = \\frac{1}{2} R_s \\int_C |{J_s}|^2 dl.</math>\n\nIt can be shown that in a classical rectangular waveguide, the attenuation of the dominant mode <math>\\text{TE}_{10}</math> due to conduction currents is given, in [[Neper]]s per [[Metre|meter]], by<math display=\"block\" id=\"alpha_c_expression\">\\alpha_C = \\frac{R_s}{a^3 b \\beta k \\eta}  \\left( 2 b \\pi^2 + a^3 k^2 \\right) =  \\frac{R_s}{\\beta k \\eta} \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi^2}{a^3 } + \\frac{k^2}{b} \\right)</math>where\n\n* <math>a</math> is the width of the waveguide\n* <math>b</math> its height\n* <math>\\eta = \\sqrt{\\mu / \\epsilon}</math> the [[wave impedance]] \n* <math>k = \\omega \\sqrt{\\mu \\epsilon}</math> the [[wave vector]]\n* <math>\\delta = 1 / \\sqrt{\\pi f \\mu \\sigma}</math> the [[Skin Depth|skin depth]] in the conductor \n* <math>R_s = \\frac{1}{\\delta \\sigma} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega \\mu}{2 \\sigma}}</math> is the [[sheet resistance]] (of surface impedance).\n\nIt is noticeable that <math>\\alpha_C</math> is directly linked to the substrate thickness <math>b</math>: the thinner the substrate, the higher the conduction losses. This can be explained keeping in mind that this ohmic losses are determined by integrating the current density on a path enclosing the waveguide walls.\n\nOn the top and bottom horizontal metallic plates, the current is scaled with <math>1/b</math>, due to the modification of the field intensity on these plates: when <math>b</math> increases, the field intensity decreases as well as the currents. In the vertical walls, this variation of <math>J_s^2</math> is compensated by the lengthening of the integration path <math>C</math>. As a result, the contribution of the vertical vias to the conductor losses is unchanged with <math>b</math>.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Bozzi|first=M.|last2=Perregrini|first2=L.|last3=Ke Wu|date=2008|title=Modeling of Conductor, Dielectric, and Radiation Losses in Substrate Integrated Waveguide by the Boundary Integral-Resonant Mode Expansion Method|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4682637/|journal=IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques|volume=56|issue=12|pages=3153\u20133161|doi=10.1109/TMTT.2008.2007140|issn=0018-9480}}</ref> That is the reason why there is two terms in the expression of <math>\\alpha_C</math>: the first is independent of <math>b</math> while the second one varies with <math>1/b</math>.\n\nAnother key point of the conduction losses experienced by the SIWs is linked to the [[Surface roughness|roughness]] of the surfaces that may appear due to the synthesis processes. This roughness decreases the effective conductivity of the metallic walls and subsequently increases the losses. This observation is of crucial importance for the design of SIWs as they are integrated on very thin substrates.

These leakages can significantly affect the global transmission quality if the vias geometry is not chosen carefully. Some studies have been conducted to describe, predict and reduce the radiation losses.

Since osteoblasts control the regulation of RANKL, the stimulation via cytokines and growth factors will then stimulate osteoblasts to increase the expression of RANKL, often while simultaneously reducing bone formation. The additional RANKL-mediated osteoclast frequency and activity will in turn increase secretion of growth factors, or matrix derived factors, which can ultimately increase tumor growth and bone destruction activity.\n\n== Clinical significance ==\nRANKL, through its ability to stimulate osteoclast formation and activity, is a critical mediator of bone resorption and overall bone density. Overproduction of RANKL is implicated in a variety of degenerative bone diseases, such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and [[psoriatic arthritis]]. In addition to degenerative bone diseases, bone metastases can also induce pain and other abnormal health complexities that can significantly reduce a cancer patient\u2019s quality of life.

Since osteoblasts control the regulation of RANKL, the stimulation via cytokines and growth factors will then stimulate osteoblasts to increase the expression of RANKL, often while simultaneously reducing bone formation. The additional RANKL-mediated osteoclast frequency and activity will in turn increase secretion of growth factors, or matrix derived factors, which can ultimately increase tumor growth and bone destruction activity.\n\n== Clinical significance ==\nRANKL, through its ability to stimulate osteoclast formation and activity, is a critical mediator of bone resorption and overall bone density.

{"title_page": "Food and drink prohibitions", "text_new": "{{About|practices and beliefs in relation to various [[food]] and potential foods|more discussion on religious views|Unclean animals}}\nSome people do not eat various specific foods and beverages in conformity with various religious, cultural, legal or other societal prohibitions. Many of these prohibitions constitute [[taboo]]s. Many food taboos and other prohibitions forbid the meat of a particular animal, including mammals, rodents, reptiles, amphibians, fish, molluscs, crustaceans and insects, which may relate to a [[disgust]] response being more often associated with meats than plant-based foods.<ref>Paul Rozin, \"Social and Moral Aspects of Food and Eating\", In: Rock, I. (ed.), ''The Legacy of Solomon Asch: Essays in Cognition and Social Psychology'', New York: Psychology Press. Chapter 6.</ref> Some prohibitions are specific to a particular part or excretion of an animal, while others forgo the consumption of plants or fungi.\n\nSome food prohibitions can be defined as rules, [[Religious law|codified by religion]] or otherwise, about which foods, or combinations of foods, may not be eaten and how animals are to be [[animal slaughter|slaughtered]] or prepared. The origins of these prohibitions are varied. In some cases, they are thought to be a result of health considerations or other practical reasons;<ref>Harris, Marvin, ''Good to Eat'', {{ISBN|0-04-306002-1}}</ref> in others, they relate to human [[symbolic system]]s.<ref>Douglas, Mary, Purity and Danger, {{ISBN|0-415-28995-5}}</ref>\n\nSome foods may be prohibited during certain religious periods (''e.g.'', [[Lent]]), at certain stages of life (''e.g.'', [[pregnancy]]), or to certain classes of people (''e.g.'', [[priest]]s), even though the food is otherwise permitted. On a comparative basis, what may be declared unfit for one group may be perfectly acceptable to another within the same culture or across different cultures. Food taboos usually seem to be intended to protect the human individual from harm, spiritually or physically, but there are numerous other reasons given within cultures for their existence. An ecological or medical background is apparent in many, including some that are seen as religious or spiritual in origin. Food taboos can help utilizing a resource more efficiently, but when applied to only a subsection of the community, a food taboo can also lead to the monopolization of a food item by those exempted. A food taboo acknowledged by a particular group or tribe as part of their ways, aids in the cohesion of the group, helps that particular group to stand out and maintain its identity in the face of others and therefore creates a feeling of \"belonging\".<ref name=\"Meyer-Rochow 2009\">{{cite journal|last=Meyer-Rochow | first= Victor Benno | title=Food taboos: their origins and purposes| journal=Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine| date=2009|volume=5:18 | pages=1\u201310|doi=10.1186/1746-4269-5-18| pmc=2711054 | pmid=19563636}}</ref>\n\n==Causes==\nVarious religions forbid the consumption of certain types of food. For example, [[Judaism]] prescribes a strict set of rules, called ''[[Kashrut]]'', regarding what may and may not be eaten, and notably forbidding the mixing of meat with dairy products. [[Islamic dietary laws|Islam has similar laws]], dividing foods into ''[[haram]]'' (forbidden) and ''[[halal]]'' (permitted). [[Jainism|Jains]] often follow religious directives to observe [[vegetarianism]]. Most [[Hindus]] do not eat beef, and some [[Hindu]]s apply the concept of ''[[ahimsa]]'' (non-violence) to their diet and consider vegetarianism as ideal, and practice forms of vegetarianism.<ref>Institutions and ideologies: a SOAS South Asia reader - 1993</ref> In some cases, the process of preparation rather than the food itself comes under scrutiny. For instance, in early medieval Christianity, certain uncooked foods were of dubious status: a [[penitential]] ascribed to [[Bede]] outlined a (mild) penance for those who ate uncooked foods, and [[Saint Boniface]] wrote to [[Pope Zachary]] (in a letter preserved in the [[Codex Vindobonensis 751#The Boniface correspondence|Boniface correspondence]], no. 87) asking him how long [[bacon]] would have to be cured to be proper for consumption.<ref>{{cite book|last=Filotas|first=Bernadette|title=Pagan Survivals, Superstitions and Popular Cultures|series=Studies and Texts|volume=151|year=2005|publisher=Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies|location=Toronto|isbn=0-88844-151-7|page=349|quote=Failing patristic authority, the pope was somewhat at a loss for an answer, finally deciding that it could be eaten smoked or roasted over the fire (presumably at any time) but, if eaten raw, only after Easter (that is, after curing for a minimum of three months, if the hogs had been slaughtered at the beginning of winter).}}</ref>  The [[Kapu]] system was used in [[Hawaii]] until 1819.\n\nAside from formal rules, there are cultural taboos against the consumption of some animals. Within a given society, some meats will be considered to be not for consumption that are outside the range of the generally accepted definition of a foodstuff. Novel meats, ''i.e.'' animal-derived food products not familiar to an individual or to a culture, generally provoke a [[disgust]] reaction, which may be expressed as a cultural taboo.<ref>Potts HWW (1999), \"Human food rejections.\" PhD thesis, University of London</ref> For example, although [[dog meat]] is eaten, in certain circumstances, in [[Korea]], [[Vietnam]], and [[China]], it is considered inappropriate as a food in Western countries. Likewise, [[horse meat]] is rarely eaten in the [[English-speaking world]], although it is part of the national cuisine of countries as widespread as [[Kazakhstan]], [[Japan]], [[Italy]], and [[France]].\n\nSometimes food prohibitions enter national or local law, as with the ban on cattle [[Slaughterhouse|abattoirs]] in most of [[India]], and [[Horse slaughter#United States|horse slaughter]] in the [[United States]]. Even after reversion to Chinese rule, [[Hong Kong]] has not lifted its ban on supplying meat from dogs and cats, imposed during [[British Hong Kong|British colonial rule]].\n\n[[Environmentalism]], [[ethical consumerism]] and other [[Activism|activist]] movements are giving rise to new prohibitions and eating guidelines. A fairly recent addition to cultural food prohibitions is the meat and eggs of [[endangered species]] or animals that are otherwise protected by law or international treaty. Examples of such protected species include some species of whales, [[sea turtle]]s, and [[bird migration|migratory birds]]. Similarly, [[sustainable seafood advisory lists and certification]] discourage the consumption of certain seafoods due to [[Unsustainable fishing methods|unsustainable fishing]]. [[Organic certification]] prohibits certain [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] chemical inputs during food production, or [[genetically modified organism]]s, [[irradiation]], and the use of [[sewage sludge]]. The [[Fair trade|Fair Trade]] movement and certification discourage the consumption of food and other goods produced in exploitative working conditions. Other [[social movement]]s generating taboos include [[Local food|Local Food]] and ''[[The 100-Mile Diet]]'', both of which encourage abstinence from non-locally produced food, and [[veganism]], in which adherents endeavour not to use or consume animal products of any kind.\n\n==Prohibited foods==\n\n===Amphibians===\n[[File:Bag of frogs legs.jpg|thumb|A bag of frog legs from Vietnam.]]\n[[File:Use of eggs, meet, vine is prohibited. Jaisalmeer. 93.jpg|thumb|\"Use of eggs, meet & vine [''meat and wine''] is prohibited.\" [[Jaisalmer]], [[Rajasthan]], India. 1993]]\n[[Judaism]] strictly forbids the consumption of [[amphibian]]s such as [[frog]]s. The restriction is described in [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]] 11:29-30 and 42\u201343. Derivative chemical products from amphibians, as well as with other proscribed animals, must be avoided.<ref name=jewish>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/overview-of-jewish-dietary-laws-and-regulations|title=Overview of Jewish Dietary Laws & Regulations|website=jewishvirtuallibrary.org}}</ref>\n\nIn other cultures, foods such as [[frog legs]] are treasured as delicacies, and the animals may be raised commercially in some circumstances.<ref name=frogs/> However, environmental concerns over the [[Endangered species|endangerment]] of frogs, even possibly pushing them into [[extinction]], due to [[overconsumption]] has prompted legal action in nations such as [[France]] to limit their use in food. The [[Ministry of Agriculture (France)|French Ministry of Agriculture]] began taking measures to protect native frog species in 1976, and efforts have continued since. Mass commercial harvesting of the animals was banned in 1980, though international imports as well as private, individual hunting and cooking remains legal in many areas.<ref name=frogs>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/aug/07/frogs-legs-extinction|title=Why we shouldn't eat frogs' legs|first=Jon|last=Henley|date=6 August 2009|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>\n\n===Bats===\nIn Judaism, the [[Deuteronomic Code]] and [[Priestly Code]] explicitly prohibit the bat.<ref name=WhatsKosher>[http://www.akhlah.com/jewish-traditions/kosher/kosher-food/ Kosher Food], The Jewish Children's Learning Network, accessed 30 November 2015.</ref> Bat meat is ''[[haram]]'' (prohibited) in Islam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.islamic-web.com/halal-haram/list-of-permitted-and-prohibited-animals/|title=List of Permitted (Halal) And Prohibited (Haram) Animals & Birds|publisher=islamic-web.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.al-islam.org/islamic-laws-ayatullah-ali-al-husayni-al-sistani/rules-things-allowed-eat-and-drink|title=Rules of Things Allowed to Eat and Drink|at=Issue 2633|publisher=al-islam.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Al-Tusi|first=Muhammad ibn Hasan|title=Concise Description of Islamic Law and Legal Opinions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FO6CBMZU5xgC|year=2008|publisher=ICAS Press|isbn=978-1-904063-29-2|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FO6CBMZU5xgC&pg=PA394&dq=bats 394]}}</ref>\n\n===Bears===\nBears are not considered [[kosher animals]] in Judaism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluethread.com/kashrut/bearnot.html<!--|date=2006-10-04-->|title=Bear meat is not kosher!|website=Bluethread.com|accessdate=2015-12-12}}</ref> All [[Predation|predatory]] [[terrestrial animal]]s are forbidden in Islam.\n\n===Birds===\nThe [[Torah]] ([[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]] 11:13<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|11:13|HE}}</ref>) explicitly states that the [[eagle]], [[vulture]], and [[osprey]] are not to be eaten. A bird now commonly raised for meat in some areas, the [[ostrich]], is explicitly banned as food in some interpretations of Leviticus 11:16.<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|11:16|HE}}</ref> Rabbis have frequently inferred that the singling out of [[birds of prey]] as well as natural [[scavenger]]s in tradition for prohibition creates a distinction with other avian species; thus, eating [[chickens]], [[ducks]], [[geese]], and [[turkeys]] is allowed.<ref name=jewish/>\n\nIn contrast Islamic dietary rules cite the ostrich is permissible to consume, while birds of prey (defined specifically as those who hunt with [[claws]] and [[talons]]) are forbidden, like Judaism.\n\nScavengers and carrion-eaters such as vultures and [[crow]]s are avoided as food in many cultures because they are perceived as carriers of disease and unclean, and associated with death. An exception is the [[rook (bird)|rook]], which was a recognised country dish, and which has in more recent times been served in a [[Scottish cuisine|Scottish]] restaurant in [[London]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/features/display.var.2509759.0.would_you_eat_rook_if_it_was_on_the_menu.php|title=Would you eat rook if it was on the menu|last=Bach|first=Daniel|date=2009-05-22|work=The online Evening Times|publisher=Newsquest (Herald & Times) Limited|accessdate=2009-10-19}}</ref> In [[Western culture]]s today, most people regard [[songbird]]s as backyard wildlife rather than as food.\n\nA [[balut (food)|balut]] is a developing bird embryo (usually a duck or chicken) that is boiled and eaten from the shell.  Part of the Quran includes understanding and respecting the law that any animal products should not be eaten if the animal has not been slaughtered properly, making the animal or animal-product \"maytah\".  Because balut is an egg containing a partly-developed embryo, Muslims believe this makes it \"haram\", or \"forbidden\".\n\n===Camels===\n[[File:07. Camel Profile, near Silverton, NSW, 07.07.2007.jpg|thumb|Dromedary camel]]\nThe eating of [[camel]]s is strictly prohibited by the Torah in {{bibleref2|Deuteronomy|14:7}} and {{bibleref2|Leviticus|11:4}}. The Torah considers the camel unclean because even though it chews the cud, or [[Regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitates]]\u2014the way bovines, sheep, goats, deer, antelope, and giraffes (all of which are [[Kashrut|kosher]]) do\u2014it does not meet the [[cloven hoof]] criterion.

Cat meat is eaten as part of the cuisines of China, Vietnam and uncommonly in Switzerland. Cats are commonly regarded as [[pet]]s in Western countries, or as working animals, kept to control vermin, not as a food animal, and consumption of cats is thus seen as a barbaric act by a large part of the population in those countries. Cat meat was eaten, for example, during the famine in the [[Siege of Leningrad]]. In 1996, a place that served cat meat was supposedly discovered by the [[Argentina|Argentine]] press in a [[villa miseria|shanty town]] in [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]], but in fact the meal had been set up by media from [[Buenos Aires]].\n\nIn 2008, it was reported that cats were a part of the local diet in [[Guangdong|Guangdong, China]], with many cats being shipped down from the north and one [[Guangzhou]]-based business receiving up to 10,000 cats per day from different parts of China.<ref>Barbara Demick, [http://articles.latimes.com/2008/dec/23/world/fg-cats23 Chinese seek to pull cats from the menu], December 23, 2008, Los Angeles Times (page A-5).</ref> Protesters in other parts of China have urged the Guangdong provincial government to crack down on cat traders and restaurants that serve cat meat, although no law says it is illegal to eat cats.<ref>[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/140111/Protesters-urge-China-province-to-stop-eating-cats Protesters urge China province to stop eating cats] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304100202/http://gmanews.tv/story/140111/Protesters-urge-China-province-to-stop-eating-cats |date=2009-03-04 }}, 18 December 2008, GMA News.</ref>\n\nThe term \"roof-hare\" (roof-rabbit, [[German language|German]] ''Dachhase'') applies to cat meat presented as that of a hare, another small mammal used as a source of meat. Subtracting the skin, feet, head and tail, hare and cat carcasses appear similar. ''Dar gato por liebre'' (\"to pass off a cat as a hare\") is an expression common to many [[Hispanophone|Spanish-speaking countries]], equivalent to \"to pull the wool over someone's eyes\" derived from this basic scam. There is an equivalent [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] expression ''Comprar gato por lebre'', meaning \"to buy a cat as a hare\". The expression ''[[churrasco]] de gato'' (\"cat barbecue\") is largely used in Brazil with a humorous note, especially for roadside stands that offer grilled meat on a stick (often coated with [[farofa]]), due to their poor hygiene and that the source of the meat is mostly unknown. Also, in the [[Philippines]], there is an urban legend and a joke that some vendors use cat meat to make ''[[siopao]]'' (steamed bun), leading some Filipinos to name their pet cats \"Siopao\". Meanwhile, \"kitten cakes\" and \"buy three [[shawarma]] - assemble a kitten\" are common [[Russian language|Russian]] urban [[Russian humour|jokes]] about the suspect origin of food from [[Hawker (trade)|street vendors']] stalls.

This is sometimes referred to as the \"Cushitic fish-taboo\", as Cushitic speakers are believed to have been responsible for the introduction of fish avoidance to [[East Africa]], though not all Cushitic groups avoid fish.

Within East Africa, the fish taboo is found no further than Tanzania. This is attributed to the local presence of the [[tsetse fly]] and in areas beyond, which likely acted as a barrier to further southern migrations by [[Nomadic pastoralism|wandering pastoralists]], the principal fish-avoiders. [[Zambia]] and [[Mozambique]]'s Bantus were therefore spared subjugation by pastoral groups, and they consequently nearly all consume fish.<ref name=\"Simoons\"/>\n\nThere is also another center of fish avoidance in [[Southern Africa]], among mainly [[Bantu languages|Bantu speakers]]. It is not clear whether this disinclination developed independently or whether it was introduced. It is certain, however, that no avoidance of fish occurs among southern Africa's earliest inhabitants, the [[Khoisan]]. Nevertheless, since the Bantu of southern Africa also share various cultural traits with the pastoralists further north in East Africa, it is believed that, at an unknown date, the taboo against the consumption of fish was similarly introduced from East Africa by cattle-herding peoples who somehow managed to get their livestock past the aforementioned tsetse fly endemic regions.<ref name=\"Simoons\"/>\n\nCertain species of fish are also forbidden in Judaism such as the freshwater [[eel]] ([[Anguillidae]]) and all species of [[catfish]]. Although they live in water, they appear to have no scales (except under a microscope) (see Leviticus 11:10-13<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{bibleverse||Leviticus|11:10-13|HE}}</ref>).

This is possibly due to the influence of Jain traditions. In Jain traditions, bad karma is generated with all forms of killing, including that of plants. Hierarchy of living creatures is based on the number of senses they possess. In this hierarchy, overwintering plants such as onions are ranked higher than other food crops such as wheat and rice. The ability of onions to observe the changing of the seasons and bloom in spring is believed to be an additional 'sense' absent in lower plants. The amount of bad karma generated depends on the number of senses the creature possesses. Therefore, it is thought best to avoid eating onions. Fungi are eschewed as they grow at night.\n\nIn [[Iceland]], rural parts of Sweden and Western Finland, although not taboo, [[edible mushroom|mushrooms]] were not widely eaten before the Second World War.

[[Maimonides]] seems to have thought the uncleanness of pigs was self-evident, but mentions with particular aversion their propensity to eat feces.<ref name=\"Abominable Pig\" />  In the 19th century some people attributed the pig taboo in the [[Middle East]] to the danger of the parasite [[trichinosis|trichina]], but this explanation is now out of favour.<ref name=\"Abominable Pig\" /> [[James George Frazer]] suggested that in ancient Israel, Egypt and Syria, the pig was originally a sacred animal, which for that reason could not be eaten or touched; the taboo survived to a time when the pig was no longer regarded as sacred, and was therefore explained by reference to its being unclean.<ref name=\"Golden Bough\" />\n\nMore recently, [[Marvin Harris]] posited that pigs are not suited for being kept in the Middle East on an ecological and socio-economical level; for example, pigs are not suited to living in arid climates and thus require more water than other animals to keep them cool, and instead of grazing they compete with humans for foods such as grains.

Many Hindus discourage eating onion and garlic along with non-vegetarian food during festivals or [[Hindu calendar|Hindu holy months]] of Shrawan, puratassi and Kartik. However, shunning onion and garlic is not very popular among Hindus as compared to avoiding non-vegetarian foods, so many people do not follow this custom.\n\n[[Jain vegetarianism|Jains]] not only abstain from consumption of meat, but also do not eat [[List of root vegetables|root vegetables]] (such as carrots, potatoes, radish, turnips, etc) as doing so kills the plant and they believe in [[ahimsa]].\n\nChinese [[Buddhist cuisine]] traditionally prohibits [[garlic]], ''[[Allium chinense]]'', [[asafoetida]], [[shallot]], and ''[[Allium victorialis]]'' (victory onion or mountain leek), while [[Kashmiri people|Kashmiri]] Brahmins forbid \"strong flavored\" foods. This encompasses garlic, onion, and spices such as [[black pepper]] and [[chili pepper]], believing that pungent flavors on the tongue inflame the baser emotions.\n\nIn [[Yazidi]]sm, the eating of [[lettuce]] and [[Phaseolus lunatus|butter beans]] is taboo. The Muslim religious teacher and scholar, Falah Hassan Juma, links the sect's belief of evil found in lettuce to its long history of persecution by Muslims and Christians. Historical theory claims one ruthless potentate who controlled the city of [[Mosul]] in the 13th century ordered an early Yazidi saint executed. The enthusiastic crowd then pelted the corpse with heads of lettuce.\n\nThe [[Pythagoreanism|followers of Pythagoras]] were vegetarians, and \"Pythagorean\" at one time came to mean \"vegetarian\". However, [[Pythagorean diet|their creed]] prohibited the eating of beans. The reason is unclear: perhaps the [[flatulence]] they cause, perhaps as protection from potential [[Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency|favism]], but most likely for [[Magic and religion|magico-religious]] reasons.<ref>\n* Gabrielle Hatfield, ''review'' of Frederick J.

The [[New Jewish Publication Society of America Version|New JPS]] translation is: \"wine and any other intoxicant\". Other versions such as the NIV prohibit both alcohol and all alcohol derived products such as wine vinegar. There is no general taboo against alcohol in Judaism.\n\nThere are also cultural taboos against the consumption of alcohol, reflected for example in the [[Teetotalism]] or [[Temperance movement]]. There is also something of a cultural taboo in several countries, against the consumption of alcohol by women during pregnancy for health reasons, as seen, for example, which in the [[Maternity Protection Convention, 2000]] by [[International Labour Conference|ILO]].\n\n===Blood===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Blood]] and [[Blood as food]]-->\n{{See also|Blood as food}}\n[[File:Dinuguan.jpg|thumb|A bowl of ''[[dinuguan]]'', a Filipino stew with pork blood]]\nSome religions prohibit drinking or eating blood or food made from blood. In Islam the consumption of blood is prohibited ([[haram|''Haraam'']]). ''[[Halal]]'' animals should be properly slaughtered to drain out the blood. Unlike in other traditions, this is not because blood is revered or holy, but simply because blood is considered [[ritually unclean]] or ''[[Najis]]'', with certain narratives prescribing [[Ritual purification|ablutions]] (in the case of no availability of water) if contact is made with it. In Judaism all mammal and bird meat (not fish) is [[Salting (food)|salted]] to remove the blood. Jews follow the teaching in Leviticus,<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|17:10-14|HE}}</ref> that since \"the life of the animal is in the blood\", no person may eat (or drink) the blood. [[Iglesia ni Cristo]] and [[Jehovah's Witness]]es prohibit eating or drinking any blood.<ref>Bible verses considered relevant to blood transfusions include {{bibleverse||Acts|15:20|9}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|15:29|9}}, and {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|21:25|9}}.</ref>\n\nAccording to the Bible, blood is only to be used for special or sacred purposes in connection with worship ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] chapters 12, 24, 29, [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 26:29 and [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]]<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|12|9}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Exodus|24|9}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Exodus|29|9}}; {{bibleverse||Matthew|26:28|9}}; {{bibleverse||Hebrews|9:22}}</ref>). In the [[Christianity in the 1st century|first century]], Christians, both former Jews (the [[Jewish Christians]]), and new [[Gentile]] converts, were in dispute as to which particular features of [[Mosaic law]] were to be retained and upheld by them.

Many of these prohibitions constitute [[taboo]]s. Many food taboos and other prohibitions forbid the meat of a particular animal, including mammals, rodents, reptiles, amphibians, fish, molluscs, crustaceans and insects, which may relate to a [[disgust]] response being more often associated with meats than plant-based foods.<ref>Paul Rozin, \"Social and Moral Aspects of Food and Eating\", In: Rock, I. (ed.), ''The Legacy of Solomon Asch: Essays in Cognition and Social Psychology'', New York: Psychology Press. Chapter 6.</ref> Some prohibitions are specific to a particular part or excretion of an animal, while others forgo the consumption of plants or fungi.\n\nSome food prohibitions can be defined as rules, [[Religious law|codified by religion]] or otherwise, about which foods, or combinations of foods, may not be eaten and how animals are to be [[animal slaughter|slaughtered]] or prepared. The origins of these prohibitions are varied. In some cases, they are thought to be a result of health considerations or other practical reasons;<ref>Harris, Marvin, ''Good to Eat'', {{ISBN|0-04-306002-1}}</ref> in others, they relate to human [[symbolic system]]s.<ref>Douglas, Mary, Purity and Danger, {{ISBN|0-415-28995-5}}</ref>\n\nSome foods may be prohibited during certain religious periods (''e.g.'', [[Lent]]), at certain stages of life (''e.g.'', [[pregnancy]]), or to certain classes of people (''e.g.'', [[priest]]s), even though the food is otherwise permitted. On a comparative basis, what may be declared unfit for one group may be perfectly acceptable to another within the same culture or across different cultures. Food taboos usually seem to be intended to protect the human individual from harm, spiritually or physically, but there are numerous other reasons given within cultures for their existence. An ecological or medical background is apparent in many, including some that are seen as religious or spiritual in origin. Food taboos can help utilizing a resource more efficiently, but when applied to only a subsection of the community, a food taboo can also lead to the monopolization of a food item by those exempted. A food taboo acknowledged by a particular group or tribe as part of their ways, aids in the cohesion of the group, helps that particular group to stand out and maintain its identity in the face of others and therefore creates a feeling of \"belonging\".<ref name=\"Meyer-Rochow 2009\">{{cite journal|last=Meyer-Rochow | first= Victor Benno | title=Food taboos: their origins and purposes| journal=Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine| date=2009|volume=5:18 | pages=1\u201310|doi=10.1186/1746-4269-5-18| pmc=2711054 | pmid=19563636}}</ref>\n\n==Causes==\nVarious religions forbid the consumption of certain types of food. For example, [[Judaism]] prescribes a strict set of rules, called ''[[Kashrut]]'', regarding what may and may not be eaten, and notably forbidding the mixing of meat with dairy products. [[Islamic dietary laws|Islam has similar laws]], dividing foods into ''[[haram]]'' (forbidden) and ''[[halal]]'' (permitted). [[Jainism|Jains]] often follow religious directives to observe [[vegetarianism]]. Most [[Hindus]] do not eat beef, and some [[Hindu]]s apply the concept of ''[[ahimsa]]'' (non-violence) to their diet and consider vegetarianism as ideal, and practice forms of vegetarianism.<ref>Institutions and ideologies: a SOAS South Asia reader - 1993</ref> In some cases, the process of preparation rather than the food itself comes under scrutiny. For instance, in early medieval Christianity, certain uncooked foods were of dubious status: a [[penitential]] ascribed to [[Bede]] outlined a (mild) penance for those who ate uncooked foods, and [[Saint Boniface]] wrote to [[Pope Zachary]] (in a letter preserved in the [[Codex Vindobonensis 751#The Boniface correspondence|Boniface correspondence]], no. 87) asking him how long [[bacon]] would have to be cured to be proper for consumption.<ref>{{cite book|last=Filotas|first=Bernadette|title=Pagan Survivals, Superstitions and Popular Cultures|series=Studies and Texts|volume=151|year=2005|publisher=Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies|location=Toronto|isbn=0-88844-151-7|page=349|quote=Failing patristic authority, the pope was somewhat at a loss for an answer, finally deciding that it could be eaten smoked or roasted over the fire (presumably at any time) but, if eaten raw, only after Easter (that is, after curing for a minimum of three months, if the hogs had been slaughtered at the beginning of winter).}}</ref>  The [[Kapu]] system was used in [[Hawaii]] until 1819.\n\nAside from formal rules, there are cultural taboos against the consumption of some animals. Within a given society, some meats will be considered to be not for consumption that are outside the range of the generally accepted definition of a foodstuff. Novel meats, ''i.e.'' animal-derived food products not familiar to an individual or to a culture, generally provoke a [[disgust]] reaction, which may be expressed as a cultural taboo.<ref>Potts HWW (1999), \"Human food rejections.\" PhD thesis, University of London</ref> For example, although [[dog meat]] is eaten, in certain circumstances, in [[Korea]], [[Vietnam]], and [[China]], it is considered inappropriate as a food in Western countries. Likewise, [[horse meat]] is rarely eaten in the [[English-speaking world]], although it is part of the national cuisine of countries as widespread as [[Kazakhstan]], [[Japan]], [[Italy]], and [[France]].\n\nSometimes food prohibitions enter national or local law, as with the ban on cattle [[Slaughterhouse|abattoirs]] in most of [[India]], and [[Horse slaughter#United States|horse slaughter]] in the [[United States]]. Even after reversion to Chinese rule, [[Hong Kong]] has not lifted its ban on supplying meat from dogs and cats, imposed during [[British Hong Kong|British colonial rule]].\n\n[[Environmentalism]], [[ethical consumerism]] and other [[Activism|activist]] movements are giving rise to new prohibitions and eating guidelines. A fairly recent addition to cultural food prohibitions is the meat and eggs of [[endangered species]] or animals that are otherwise protected by law or international treaty. Examples of such protected species include some species of whales, [[sea turtle]]s, and [[bird migration|migratory birds]]. Similarly, [[sustainable seafood advisory lists and certification]] discourage the consumption of certain seafoods due to [[Unsustainable fishing methods|unsustainable fishing]]. [[Organic certification]] prohibits certain [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] chemical inputs during food production, or [[genetically modified organism]]s, [[irradiation]], and the use of [[sewage sludge]]. The [[Fair trade|Fair Trade]] movement and certification discourage the consumption of food and other goods produced in exploitative working conditions.

Cat meat is eaten as part of the cuisines of China, Vietnam and uncommonly in Switzerland. Cats are commonly regarded as [[pet]]s in Western countries, or as working animals, kept to control vermin, not as a food animal, and consumption of cats is thus seen as a barbaric act by a large part of the population in those countries. Cat meat was eaten, for example, during the famine in the [[Siege of Leningrad]]. In 1996, a place that served cat meat was supposedly discovered by the [[Argentina|Argentine]] press in a [[villa miseria|shanty town]] in [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]], but in fact the meal had been set up by media from [[Buenos Aires]].\n\nIn 2008, it was reported that cats were a part of the local diet in [[Guangdong|Guangdong, China]], with many cats being shipped down from the north and one [[Guangzhou]]-based business receiving up to 10,000 cats per day from different parts of China.<ref>Barbara Demick, [http://articles.latimes.com/2008/dec/23/world/fg-cats23 Chinese seek to pull cats from the menu], December 23, 2008, Los Angeles Times (page A-5).</ref> Protesters in other parts of China have urged the Guangdong provincial government to crack down on cat traders and restaurants that serve cat meat, although no law says it is illegal to eat cats.<ref>[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/140111/Protesters-urge-China-province-to-stop-eating-cats Protesters urge China province to stop eating cats] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304100202/http://gmanews.tv/story/140111/Protesters-urge-China-province-to-stop-eating-cats |date=2009-03-04 }}, 18 December 2008, GMA News.</ref>\n\nThe term \"roof-hare\" (roof-rabbit, [[German language|German]] ''Dachhase'') applies to cat meat presented as that of a hare, another small mammal used as a source of meat. Subtracting the skin, feet, head and tail, hare and cat carcasses appear similar. ''Dar gato por liebre'' (\"to pass off a cat as a hare\") is an expression common to many [[Hispanophone|Spanish-speaking countries]], equivalent to \"to pull the wool over someone's eyes\" derived from this basic scam. There is an equivalent [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] expression ''Comprar gato por lebre'', meaning \"to buy a cat as a hare\". The expression ''[[churrasco]] de gato'' (\"cat barbecue\") is largely used in Brazil with a humorous note, especially for roadside stands that offer grilled meat on a stick (often coated with [[farofa]]), due to their poor hygiene and that the source of the meat is mostly unknown. Also, in the [[Philippines]], there is an urban legend and a joke that some vendors use cat meat to make ''[[siopao]]'' (steamed bun), leading some Filipinos to name their pet cats \"Siopao\". Meanwhile, \"kitten cakes\" and \"buy three [[shawarma]] - assemble a kitten\" are common [[Russian language|Russian]] urban [[Russian humour|jokes]] about the suspect origin of food from [[Hawker (trade)|street vendors']] stalls.

This is sometimes referred to as the \"Cushitic fish-taboo\", as Cushitic speakers are believed to have been responsible for the introduction of fish avoidance to [[East Africa]], though not all Cushitic groups avoid fish. The zone of the fish taboo roughly coincides with the area where [[Cushitic languages]] are spoken, and as a general rule, speakers of [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] and [[Semitic languages]] do not have this taboo, and indeed many are watermen.<ref name=\"Simoons\"/><ref>{{cite journal |first=J.

Within East Africa, the fish taboo is found no further than Tanzania. This is attributed to the local presence of the [[tsetse fly]] and in areas beyond, which likely acted as a barrier to further southern migrations by [[Nomadic pastoralism|wandering pastoralists]], the principal fish-avoiders. [[Zambia]] and [[Mozambique]]'s Bantus were therefore spared subjugation by pastoral groups, and they consequently nearly all consume fish.<ref name=\"Simoons\"/>\n\nThere is also another center of fish avoidance in [[Southern Africa]], among mainly [[Bantu languages|Bantu speakers]]. It is not clear whether this disinclination developed independently or whether it was introduced. It is certain, however, that no avoidance of fish occurs among southern Africa's earliest inhabitants, the [[Khoisan]]. Nevertheless, since the Bantu of southern Africa also share various cultural traits with the pastoralists further north in East Africa, it is believed that, at an unknown date, the taboo against the consumption of fish was similarly introduced from East Africa by cattle-herding peoples who somehow managed to get their livestock past the aforementioned tsetse fly endemic regions.<ref name=\"Simoons\"/>\n\nCertain species of fish are also forbidden in Judaism such as the freshwater [[eel]] ([[Anguillidae]]) and all species of [[catfish]]. Although they live in water, they appear to have no scales (except under a microscope) (see Leviticus 11:10-13<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{bibleverse||Leviticus|11:10-13|HE}}</ref>). Sunni Muslim laws are more flexible in this. Catfish and shark are generally seen as halal as they are special types of fish. Eel is generally considered permissible in the four Sunni ''madh'hab.'' The Ja'fari jurisprudence followed by most Shia Muslims forbid all species of fish that does not have scales, it also forbid all shell fish species except prawns.<ref>\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.albalagh.net/qa/sea_food_madhahib.shtml |accessdate=2007-02-16|title=Sea Food in the Four Madhahib|website=Albalagh.net}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.shariahprogram.ca/eat-halal-foods/catfish-halal.shtml |accessdate=2007-02-16|title=Is Catfish Halal?|website=Shariahprogram.ca}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.shariahprogram.ca/eat-halal-foods/shark-meat-halal.shtml |accessdate=2007-02-16|title=Is Shark Meat Halal?|website=Shariahprogram.ca}}</ref>\n\nMany tribes of the [[Southwestern United States]], including the [[Navajo people|Navajo]], [[Apache]], and [[Zuni people|Zu\u00f1i]], have a taboo against fish and other water-related animals, including [[waterfowl]].<ref>Washington Matthews, \"Ichthyophobia\" ''The Journal of American Folklore'' '''11''':41 (April\u2013June, 1898), pp. 105-112 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/533215 at JSTOR]{{subscription}}</ref>\n\n[[Norse settlements in Greenland|Norse settlers in Greenland]] (10th\u201315th centuries AD) may have developed a taboo against fish consumption, as recounted in [[Jared Diamond]]'s ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]''.

This is possibly due to the influence of Jain traditions. In Jain traditions, bad karma is generated with all forms of killing, including that of plants. Hierarchy of living creatures is based on the number of senses they possess. In this hierarchy, overwintering plants such as onions are ranked higher than other food crops such as wheat and rice. The ability of onions to observe the changing of the seasons and bloom in spring is believed to be an additional 'sense' absent in lower plants. The amount of bad karma generated depends on the number of senses the creature possesses. Therefore, it is thought best to avoid eating onions. Fungi are eschewed as they grow at night.\n\nIn [[Iceland]], rural parts of Sweden and Western Finland, although not taboo, [[edible mushroom|mushrooms]] were not widely eaten before the Second World War.

Newer techniques for making cheese include a chemical process with artificial rennet. This means that the ''process'' by which cheese is made (and not the cheese itself) is a factor in determining whether it is forbidden or allowed by strict vegetarians.\n\n===Pigs/pork===\n{{Main|Religious restrictions on the consumption of pork}}\n[[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) data reports [[pork]] as the most widely eaten meat in the world. Consumption of pigs is forbidden in Islam, Judaism and certain [[Christian denomination]]s, such as [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]]. This prohibition is set out in the holy texts of the religions concerned, e.g. [[Qur'an]] 2:173, 5:3, 6:145 and 16:115,<ref name=\"cite quran|16|115|s=ns\">{{cite quran|16|115|s=ns}}</ref> Leviticus 11:7-8<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|11:7-8|HE}}</ref> and Deuteronomy 14:8.<ref>{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|14:8|HE}}</ref>  Pigs were also taboo in at least three other cultures of the ancient Middle East: the [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] and [[Babylonia]]ns.<ref name=\"Abominable Pig\" />  In some instances, the taboo extended beyond eating pork, and it was also taboo to touch or even look at pigs.<ref name=\"Abominable Pig\" /><ref name=\"Golden Bough\">{{cite book |last=Frazer |first=James George |title=[[The Golden Bough]] |authorlink=James George Frazer |edition=A new abridgement from the second and third editions |year=1994 |publisher=OUP |pages=486\u2013492}}</ref> Some people used as [[vulgarity|vulgar]] speech.\n\nThe original reason for this taboo is debated. [[Maimonides]] seems to have thought the uncleanness of pigs was self-evident, but mentions with particular aversion their propensity to eat feces.<ref name=\"Abominable Pig\" />  In the 19th century some people attributed the pig taboo in the [[Middle East]] to the danger of the parasite [[trichinosis|trichina]], but this explanation is now out of favour.<ref name=\"Abominable Pig\" /> [[James George Frazer]] suggested that in ancient Israel, Egypt and Syria, the pig was originally a sacred animal, which for that reason could not be eaten or touched; the taboo survived to a time when the pig was no longer regarded as sacred, and was therefore explained by reference to its being unclean.<ref name=\"Golden Bough\" />\n\nMore recently, [[Marvin Harris]] posited that pigs are not suited for being kept in the Middle East on an ecological and socio-economical level; for example, pigs are not suited to living in arid climates and thus require more water than other animals to keep them cool, and instead of grazing they compete with humans for foods such as grains. As such, raising pigs was seen as a wasteful and decadent practice.<ref name=\"Abominable Pig\">{{cite journal |last=Harris |first=Martin |editor=Carole Counihan and Penny Van Esterik |year=1997 |title=The Abominable Pig |work=Food and Culture |pages=67\u201379 |location=London |publisher=Routledge}}</ref>  Another explanation offered for the taboo is that pigs are [[Omnivore|omnivorous]], not discerning between meat or vegetation in their natural dietary habits.

Many Hindus discourage eating onion and garlic along with non-vegetarian food during festivals or [[Hindu calendar|Hindu holy months]] of Shrawan, puratassi and Kartik. However, shunning onion and garlic is not very popular among Hindus as compared to avoiding non-vegetarian foods, so many people do not follow this custom.\n\n[[Jain vegetarianism|Jains]] not only abstain from consumption of meat, but also do not eat [[List of root vegetables|root vegetables]] (such as carrots, potatoes, radish, turnips, etc) as doing so kills the plant and they believe in [[ahimsa]].\n\nChinese [[Buddhist cuisine]] traditionally prohibits [[garlic]], ''[[Allium chinense]]'', [[asafoetida]], [[shallot]], and ''[[Allium victorialis]]'' (victory onion or mountain leek), while [[Kashmiri people|Kashmiri]] Brahmins forbid \"strong flavored\" foods. This encompasses garlic, onion, and spices such as [[black pepper]] and [[chili pepper]], believing that pungent flavors on the tongue inflame the baser emotions.\n\nIn [[Yazidi]]sm, the eating of [[lettuce]] and [[Phaseolus lunatus|butter beans]] is taboo. The Muslim religious teacher and scholar, Falah Hassan Juma, links the sect's belief of evil found in lettuce to its long history of persecution by Muslims and Christians. Historical theory claims one ruthless potentate who controlled the city of [[Mosul]] in the 13th century ordered an early Yazidi saint executed. The enthusiastic crowd then pelted the corpse with heads of lettuce.\n\nThe [[Pythagoreanism|followers of Pythagoras]] were vegetarians, and \"Pythagorean\" at one time came to mean \"vegetarian\". However, [[Pythagorean diet|their creed]] prohibited the eating of beans. The reason is unclear: perhaps the [[flatulence]] they cause, perhaps as protection from potential [[Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency|favism]], but most likely for [[Magic and religion|magico-religious]] reasons.<ref>\n* Gabrielle Hatfield, ''review'' of Frederick J.

The [[New Jewish Publication Society of America Version|New JPS]] translation is: \"wine and any other intoxicant\". Other versions such as the NIV prohibit both alcohol and all alcohol derived products such as wine vinegar. There is no general taboo against alcohol in Judaism.\n\nThere are also cultural taboos against the consumption of alcohol, reflected for example in the [[Teetotalism]] or [[Temperance movement]].

In Islam the consumption of blood is prohibited ([[haram|''Haraam'']]). ''[[Halal]]'' animals should be properly slaughtered to drain out the blood. Unlike in other traditions, this is not because blood is revered or holy, but simply because blood is considered [[ritually unclean]] or ''[[Najis]]'', with certain narratives prescribing [[Ritual purification|ablutions]] (in the case of no availability of water) if contact is made with it. In Judaism all mammal and bird meat (not fish) is [[Salting (food)|salted]] to remove the blood. Jews follow the teaching in Leviticus,<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|17:10-14|HE}}</ref> that since \"the life of the animal is in the blood\", no person may eat (or drink) the blood. [[Iglesia ni Cristo]] and [[Jehovah's Witness]]es prohibit eating or drinking any blood.<ref>Bible verses considered relevant to blood transfusions include {{bibleverse||Acts|15:20|9}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|15:29|9}}, and {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|21:25|9}}.</ref>\n\nAccording to the Bible, blood is only to be used for special or sacred purposes in connection with worship ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] chapters 12, 24, 29, [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 26:29 and [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]]<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|12|9}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Exodus|24|9}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Exodus|29|9}}; {{bibleverse||Matthew|26:28|9}}; {{bibleverse||Hebrews|9:22}}</ref>).
