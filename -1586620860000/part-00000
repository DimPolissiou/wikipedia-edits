Multivalent cations are positively charged [[metal complex]]es with a charge greater than 1+. Usually, the cations have the charge of 2+. Common cations found in hard water include Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. These ions enter a water supply by leaching from minerals within an [[aquifer]]. Common [[calcium]]-containing minerals are [[calcite]] and [[gypsum]]. A common [[magnesium]] mineral is [[dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]] (which also contains calcium). [[Rain|Rainwater]] and [[distillation|distilled]] water are [[soft water|soft]], because they contain few [[ion]]s.<ref name=Ullmann>[[Hermann Weing\u00e4rtner]], \"Water\" in [[Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry]], 2006[December], Wiley\u2013VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a28_001}}</ref>\n\nThe following [[equilibrium reaction]] describes the [[dissolution (chemistry)|dissolving]] and formation of [[calcium carbonate]] and [[calcium bicarbonate]] (on the right):\n:CaCO<sub>3</sub> (s) + CO<sub>2</sub> (aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O (l) {{eqm}} Ca<sup>2+</sup> (aq) + 2&nbsp;{{chem|HCO|3|\u2212}} (aq)\n\nThe reaction can go in either direction. Rain containing dissolved carbon dioxide can react with calcium carbonate and carry calcium ions away with it.

When dissolved, these type of minerals yield calcium and magnesium [[cations]] (Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>) and carbonate and [[bicarbonate]] [[anion]]s ({{chem|CO|3|2\u2212}} and {{chem|HCO|3|\u2212}}). The presence of the metal cations makes the water hard. However, unlike the [[#Permanent hardness|permanent hardness]] caused by [[sulfate]] and [[chloride]] [[compound (chemistry)|compound]]s, this \"temporary\" hardness can be reduced either by boiling the water, or by the addition of [[lime (mineral)|lime]] ([[calcium hydroxide]]) through the process of [[lime softening]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Lime Softening| url=http://water.me.vccs.edu/concepts/softeninglime.html|accessdate=4 November 2011}}</ref> Boiling promotes the formation of carbonate from the bicarbonate and precipitates calcium carbonate out of solution, leaving water that is softer upon cooling.\n\n===Permanent hardness===\nPermanent hardness (mineral content) are generally difficult to remove by [[boiling]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sengupta|first=Pallav|date=August 2013|title=Potential Health Impacts of Hard Water|journal=[[International Journal of Preventive Medicine]]|volume=4|issue=8|pages=866\u2013875|issn=2008-7802|pmc=3775162|pmid=24049611}}</ref> If this occurs, it is usually caused by the presence of [[calcium sulfate]]/[[calcium chloride]] and/or [[magnesium sulfate]]/[[magnesium chloride]] in the water, which do not precipitate out as the [[temperature]] increases. Ions causing permanent hardness of water can be removed using a water softener, or [[ion exchange]] column.\n\n:permanent hardness = permanent calcium hardness + permanent magnesium hardness.\n\n==Effects==\nWith hard water, soap solutions form a white precipitate ([[soap scum]]) instead of producing [[Foam|lather]], because the 2+ ions destroy the [[surfactant]] properties of the soap by forming a solid precipitate (the soap scum). A major component of such scum is [[calcium stearate]], which arises from [[sodium stearate]], the main component of [[soap]]:\n:2&nbsp;C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>35</sub>COO<sup>\u2212</sup> (aq) + Ca<sup>2+</sup> (aq) \u2192 (C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>35</sub>COO)<sub>2</sub>Ca (s)\nHardness can thus be defined as the soap-consuming capacity of a water sample, or the capacity of precipitation of soap as a characteristic property of water that prevents the lathering of soap. Synthetic [[detergent]]s do not form such scums.\n[[File:Eifelwasserleitung05.jpg|right|thumb|210px|A portion of the ancient Roman [[Eifel aqueduct]] in Germany. After being in service for about 180 years, the aqueduct had mineral deposits of up to {{cvt|20|cm|0}} thick along the walls.]]\n\nHard water also forms deposits that clog plumbing. These deposits, called \"[[Fouling|scale]]\", are composed mainly of [[calcium carbonate]] (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), [[magnesium hydroxide]] (Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>), and [[calcium sulfate]] (CaSO<sub>4</sub>).<ref name=Ullmann/> Calcium and magnesium carbonates tend to be deposited as off-white solids on the inside surfaces of pipes and [[heat exchanger]]s. This precipitation (formation of an insoluble solid) is principally caused by thermal decomposition of bicarbonate ions but also happens in cases where the carbonate ion is at saturation concentration.<ref>[http://dnr.wi.gov/regulations/labcert/documents/training/basics-genchem.pdf Wisconisin DNR - Carbonate chemistry]</ref> The resulting build-up of scale restricts the flow of water in pipes. In boilers, the deposits impair the flow of heat into water, reducing the heating efficiency and allowing the metal boiler components to overheat. In a pressurized system, this overheating can lead to failure of the boiler.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chem1.com/CQ/hardwater.html |title=Hard water and water softening |accessdate=2007-10-08 |author=Stephen Lower |date=July 2007 |website= |publisher=}}</ref> The damage caused by calcium carbonate deposits varies on the crystalline form, for example, [[calcite]] or [[aragonite]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wrc.org.za/Knowledge%20Hub%20Documents/Water%20SA%20Journals/Manuscripts/1998/01/WaterSA_1998_01_jan98_p77.pdf |title=Scale reduction and scale modification effects induced by Zn |accessdate=2010-03-29 |author=PP Coetzee |month= |year=1998 |website= |publisher= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509172117/http://www.wrc.org.za/Knowledge%20Hub%20Documents/Water%20SA%20Journals/Manuscripts/1998/01/WaterSA_1998_01_jan98_p77.pdf |archive-date=2016-05-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe presence of [[ion]]s in an [[electrolyte]], in this case, hard water, can also lead to [[galvanic corrosion]], in which one metal will preferentially [[corrode]] when in contact with another type of metal, when both are in contact with an electrolyte.

Calcium and magnesium hydroxides are both soluble in water. The solubility of the hydroxides of the alkaline-earth metals to which calcium and magnesium belong ([[Periodic table#Groups|group 2 of the periodic table]]) increases moving down the column. Aqueous solutions of these metal hydroxides absorb carbon dioxide from the air, forming the insoluble carbonates, giving rise to the turbidity.  This often results from the [[pH]] being excessively high (pH&nbsp;>&nbsp;7.6). Hence, a common solution to the problem is, while maintaining the chlorine concentration at the proper level, to lower the pH by the addition of hydrochloric acid, the optimum value being in the range of 7.2 to 7.6.\n\n===Softening===\n{{Main|Water softening}}\nIt is often desirable to soften hard water. Most detergents contain ingredients that counteract the effects of hard water on the surfactants. For this reason, water softening is often unnecessary. Where softening is practiced, it is often recommended to soften only the water sent to domestic hot water systems so as to prevent or delay inefficiencies and damage due to scale formation in water heaters. A common method for water softening involves the use of [[ion exchange resin]]s, which replace ions like Ca<sup>2+</sup> by twice the number of monocations such as [[sodium]] or [[potassium]] ions.\n\n[[Washing soda]] ([[sodium carbonate]], Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) is easily obtained and has long been used as a water softener for domestic laundry, in conjunction with the usual soap or detergent.\n\n===Health considerations===\nThe [[World Health Organization]] says that \"there does not appear to be any convincing evidence that water hardness causes adverse health effects in humans\".<ref name=\"who\" /> In fact, the [[United States National Research Council]] has found that hard water actually serves as a dietary supplement for calcium and magnesium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.water-research.net/hardness.htm |title=Drinking Water Hardwater Hardness Calcium Magnesium Scale Stained Laundry |publisher=Water-research.net |date= |accessdate=2013-01-26}}</ref>\n\nSome studies have shown a weak [[inverse relationship]] between water hardness and [[cardiovascular disease]] in men, up to a level of 170&nbsp;mg calcium carbonate per litre of water.

The total water hardness is the sum of the [[molar concentration]]s of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>, in mol/L or mmol/L units. Although water hardness usually measures only the total concentrations of calcium and magnesium (the two most prevalent [[divalent]] metal ions), [[iron]], [[aluminium]], and [[manganese]] can also be present at elevated levels in some locations. The presence of iron characteristically confers a brownish ([[rust]]-like) colour to the calcification, instead of white (the color of most of the other compounds).\n\nWater hardness is often not expressed as a molar concentration, but rather in various units, such as degrees of general hardness ([[dGH]]), German degrees (\u00b0dH), parts per million (ppm, mg/L, or American degrees), grains per gallon (gpg), English degrees (\u00b0e, e, or [[Thomas Clark (chemist)|\u00b0Clark]]), or French degrees (\u00b0fH, \u00b0f or \u00b0HF; lowercase ''f'' is used to prevent confusion with degrees [[Fahrenheit]]). The table below shows conversion factors between the various units.\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Hardness unit conversion.\n|-\n!  || 1&nbsp;mmol/L || 1 ppm, mg/L || 1 dGH, \u00b0dH || 1 gpg || 1 \u00b0e, \u00b0Clark || 1 \u00b0fH\n|-\n! mmol/L  \n| 1        || 0.009991 || 0.1783   || 0.171    || 0.1424   || 0.09991   \n|-\n! ppm, mg/L    \n| 100.1    || 1        || 17.85    || 17.12    || 14.25    ||10\n|-\n! dGH, \u00b0dH\n| 5.608    || 0.05603  || 1        || 0.9591   || 0.7986   || 0.5603    \n|-\n! gpg     \n| 5.847    || 0.05842  || 1.043    || 1        || 0.8327   || 0.5842    \n|-\n! \u00b0e, \u00b0Clark\n| 7.022    || 0.07016  || 1.252    || 1.201    || 1        || 0.7016    \n|-\n! \u00b0fH     \n| 10.01    ||0.1|| 1.785    || 1.712    || 1.425    || 1         \n|}\nThe various alternative units represent an equivalent mass of calcium oxide (CaO) or calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) that, when dissolved in a unit volume of pure water, would result in the same total molar concentration of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The different conversion factors arise from the fact that equivalent masses of calcium oxide and calcium carbonates differ, and that different mass and volume units are used. The units are as follows:\n* ''Parts per million (ppm)'' is usually defined as 1&nbsp;mg/L CaCO<sub>3</sub> (the definition used below).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thekrib.com/Plants/CO2/hardness-larryfrank.html|title=Water Hardness|work=thekrib.com}}</ref> It is equivalent to '''mg/L''' without chemical compound specified, and to '''American degree'''.\n* ''[[Grains per Gallon]] (gpg)'' is defined as 1 [[Grain (measure)|grain]] (64.8&nbsp;mg) of calcium carbonate per [[U.S. gallon]] (3.79 litres), or 17.118 ppm.\n* a ''mmol/L'' is equivalent to 100.09&nbsp;mg/L CaCO<sub>3</sub> or 40.08&nbsp;mg/L Ca<sup>2+</sup>.\n* A ''degree of General Hardness ([[dGH]]'' or 'German degree (\u00b0dH, ''deutsche H\u00e4rte''))' is defined as 10&nbsp;mg/L CaO or 17.848 ppm.\n* A ''Clark degree (\u00b0Clark)'' or ''English degrees (\u00b0e or e)'' is defined as one [[Grain (measure)|grain]] (64.8&nbsp;mg) of CaCO<sub>3</sub> per [[Imperial gallon]] (4.55 litres) of water, equivalent to 14.254 ppm.\n* A ''French degree (\u00b0fH or \u00b0f)'' is defined as 10&nbsp;mg/L CaCO<sub>3</sub>, equivalent to 10 ppm.\n\n===Hard/soft classification===\nAs it is the precise mixture of minerals dissolved in the water, together with the water's [[pH]] and temperature, that determine the behavior of the hardness, a single-number scale does not adequately describe hardness. However, the [[United States Geological Survey]] uses the following classification into hard and soft water,<ref name=USGS>{{cite web|url=http://water.usgs.gov/owq/hardness-alkalinity.html|title=USGS Water-Quality Information: Water Hardness and Alkalinity|author=USGS - U.S. Geological Survey Office of Water Quality|work=usgs.gov}}</ref>\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

A scale layer of CaCO<sub>3</sub> is neither precipitated nor dissolved.\n* For LSI < 0, water is under saturated and tends to dissolve solid CaCO<sub>3</sub>.\n\nIf the actual pH of the water is below the calculated saturation pH, the LSI is negative and the water has a very limited scaling potential. If the actual pH exceeds pHs, the LSI is positive, and being supersaturated with CaCO<sub>3</sub>, the water has a tendency to form scale. At increasing positive index values, the scaling potential increases.\n\nIn practice, water with an LSI between \u22120.5 and +0.5 will not display enhanced mineral dissolving or scale forming properties. Water with an LSI below \u22120.5 tends to exhibit noticeably increased dissolving abilities while water with an LSI above +0.5 tends to exhibit noticeably increased scale forming properties.\n\nThe LSI is temperature sensitive. The LSI becomes more positive as the water temperature increases. This has particular implications in situations where well water is used. The temperature of the water when it first exits the well is often significantly lower than the temperature inside the building served by the well or at the laboratory where the LSI measurement is made. This increase in temperature can cause scaling, especially in cases such as hot water heaters. Conversely, systems that reduce water temperature will have less scaling.\n:   Water Analysis:\n::        pH = 7.5\n::        TDS = 320&nbsp;mg/L\n::        Calcium = 150&nbsp;mg/L (or ppm) as CaCO<sub>3</sub>\n::        Alkalinity = 34&nbsp;mg/L (or ppm) as CaCO<sub>3</sub>\n\n:    LSI formula:\n::      LSI = pH \u2212 pH<sub>s</sub>\n::      pH<sub>s</sub> = (9.3 + A + B) \u2212 (C + D) where:\n::        A = {{sfrac|log<sub>10</sub>[TDS] \u2212 1|10}} = 0.15\n::        B = \u221213.12 \u00d7 log<sub>10</sub>(\u00b0C + 273) + 34.55 = 2.09 at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C and 1.09 at 82&nbsp;\u00b0C\n::        C = log<sub>10</sub>[Ca<sup>2+</sup> as CaCO<sub>3</sub>] - 0.4 = 1.78         \n:::           (Ca<sup>2+</sup> as CaCO<sub>3</sub> is also called calcium hardness, and is calculated as 2.5[Ca<sup>2+</sup>])\n::        D = log<sub>10</sub>[alkalinity as CaCO<sub>3</sub>] = 1.53\n\n====Ryznar Stability Index (RSI)====\nThe Ryznar stability index (RSI)<ref name=\"McTigueSymons2011\" />{{rp|525}} uses a database of scale thickness measurements in municipal water systems to predict the effect of water chemistry.<ref name=\"Reid2003\" />{{rp|72}}<ref name=\"Emerson2003\">{{cite book|last=Emerson|first=A.

[[Wales]], [[Devon]], [[Cornwall]] and parts of [[North West England|northwest England]] are softer water areas, and range from 0 to 200 ppm.<ref>[http://www.anglianwater.co.uk/_assets/media/Hard_Water_Bro_16-3-09_12PP.pdf anglianwater.co.uk]</ref> In the [[brewing]] industry in England and Wales, water is often deliberately hardened with [[gypsum]] in the process of [[Burtonisation]].\n\nGenerally water is mostly hard in urban areas of England where soft water sources are unavailable. A number of cities built water supply sources in the 18th century as the [[industrial revolution]] and urban population burgeoned. [[Manchester]] was a notable such city in North West England and its wealthy corporation built a number of reservoirs at [[Thirlmere]] and [[Haweswater]] in the [[Lake District]] to the north. There is no exposure to [[limestone]] or [[chalk]] in their [[headwaters]] and consequently the water in Manchester is rated as 'very soft'.<ref name=\"manchester\"/> Similarly, tap water in [[Birmingham]] is also soft as it is sourced from the [[Elan Valley Reservoirs]] in Wales, even though groundwater in the area is hard.\n\n=== In Ireland ===\nThe EPA has published a standards handbook for the interpretation of water quality in Ireland in which definitions of water hardness are given.<ref>Section 36 \"Hardness\" https://www.epa.ie/pubs/advice/water/quality/Water_Quality.pdf</ref>\nIn this section, reference to original EU documentation is given, which sets out no limit for hardness.\nIn turn, the handbook also gives no \"Recommended or Mandatory Limit Values\" for hardness.\nThe handbooks does indicate that above the midpoint of the ranges defined as \"Moderately Hard\", effects are seen increasingly: \"The chief disadvantages of hard waters are that they neutralise the lathering power of soap.... and, more important, that they can cause blockage of pipes and severely reduced boiler efficiency because of scale formation. These effects will increase as the hardness rises to and beyond 200 mg/l CaCO3.\"\n\n=== In the United States ===\nA collection of data from the United States found that about half the water stations tested had hardness over 120&nbsp;mg per litre of calcium carbonate equivalent, placing them in the categories \"hard\" or \"very hard\".<ref name=USGS/> The other half were classified as soft or moderately hard.

Hard water is formed when water [[percolation|percolates]] through deposits of [[limestone]], [[chalk]] or [[gypsum]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wellowner.org/water-quality/ground-water-quality-basics/|title=Hard water|publisher=National Groundwater Association|access-date=28 June 2019}}</ref> which are largely made up of [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]] [[carbonate]]s, [[bicarbonate]]s and [[sulfate]]s.\n\nHard [[drinking water]] may have moderate health benefits, but can pose critical problems in industrial settings, where water hardness is monitored to avoid costly breakdowns in [[boiler]]s, [[cooling tower]]s, and other equipment that handles water. In domestic settings, hard water is often indicated by a lack of [[foam]] formation when [[soap]] is agitated in water, and by the formation of [[limescale]] in kettles and water heaters.<ref name=\"who\">World Health Organization [http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/chemicals/hardness.pdf Hardness in Drinking-Water], 2003</ref> Wherever water hardness is a concern, [[water softening]] is commonly used to reduce hard water's adverse effects.\n\n==Sources of hardness==\nWater's hardness is determined by the [[concentration]] of [[multivalent]] [[cations]] in the water. Multivalent cations are positively charged [[metal complex]]es with a charge greater than 1+. Usually, the cations have the charge of 2+. Common cations found in hard water include Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. These ions enter a water supply by leaching from minerals within an [[aquifer]]. Common [[calcium]]-containing minerals are [[calcite]] and [[gypsum]]. A common [[magnesium]] mineral is [[dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]] (which also contains calcium). [[Rain|Rainwater]] and [[distillation|distilled]] water are [[soft water|soft]], because they contain few [[ion]]s.<ref name=Ullmann>[[Hermann Weing\u00e4rtner]], \"Water\" in [[Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry]], 2006[December], Wiley\u2013VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a28_001}}</ref>\n\nThe following [[equilibrium reaction]] describes the [[dissolution (chemistry)|dissolving]] and formation of [[calcium carbonate]] and [[calcium bicarbonate]] (on the right):\n:CaCO<sub>3</sub> (s) + CO<sub>2</sub> (aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O (l) {{eqm}} Ca<sup>2+</sup> (aq) + 2&nbsp;{{chem|HCO|3|\u2212}} (aq)\n\nThe reaction can go in either direction. Rain containing dissolved carbon dioxide can react with calcium carbonate and carry calcium ions away with it. The calcium carbonate may be re-deposited as calcite as the carbon dioxide is lost to atmosphere, sometimes forming [[stalactite]]s and [[stalagmite]]s.\n\nCalcium and magnesium ions can sometimes be removed by water softeners.<ref>Christian Nitsch, Hans-Joachim Heitland, Horst Marsen, Hans-Joachim Schl\u00fcussler, \"Cleansing Agents\" in [[Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry]] 2005, Wiley\u2013VCH, Weinheim. {{doi|10.1002/14356007.a07_137}}</ref>\n\n===Temporary hardness===\n{{see also|Carbonate hardness}}\nTemporary hardness is a type of water hardness caused by the presence of [[dissolution (chemistry)|dissolved]] [[bicarbonate]] [[mineral]]s ([[calcium bicarbonate]] and [[magnesium bicarbonate]]). When dissolved, these type of minerals yield calcium and magnesium [[cations]] (Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>) and carbonate and [[bicarbonate]] [[anion]]s ({{chem|CO|3|2\u2212}} and {{chem|HCO|3|\u2212}}). The presence of the metal cations makes the water hard. However, unlike the [[#Permanent hardness|permanent hardness]] caused by [[sulfate]] and [[chloride]] [[compound (chemistry)|compound]]s, this \"temporary\" hardness can be reduced either by boiling the water, or by the addition of [[lime (mineral)|lime]] ([[calcium hydroxide]]) through the process of [[lime softening]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Lime Softening| url=http://water.me.vccs.edu/concepts/softeninglime.html|accessdate=4 November 2011}}</ref> Boiling promotes the formation of carbonate from the bicarbonate and precipitates calcium carbonate out of solution, leaving water that is softer upon cooling.\n\n===Permanent hardness===\nPermanent hardness (mineral content) are generally difficult to remove by [[boiling]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sengupta|first=Pallav|date=August 2013|title=Potential Health Impacts of Hard Water|journal=[[International Journal of Preventive Medicine]]|volume=4|issue=8|pages=866\u2013875|issn=2008-7802|pmc=3775162|pmid=24049611}}</ref> If this occurs, it is usually caused by the presence of [[calcium sulfate]]/[[calcium chloride]] and/or [[magnesium sulfate]]/[[magnesium chloride]] in the water, which do not precipitate out as the [[temperature]] increases. Ions causing permanent hardness of water can be removed using a water softener, or [[ion exchange]] column.\n\n:permanent hardness = permanent calcium hardness + permanent magnesium hardness.\n\n==Effects==\nWith hard water, soap solutions form a white precipitate ([[soap scum]]) instead of producing [[Foam|lather]], because the 2+ ions destroy the [[surfactant]] properties of the soap by forming a solid precipitate (the soap scum). A major component of such scum is [[calcium stearate]], which arises from [[sodium stearate]], the main component of [[soap]]:\n:2&nbsp;C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>35</sub>COO<sup>\u2212</sup> (aq) + Ca<sup>2+</sup> (aq) \u2192 (C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>35</sub>COO)<sub>2</sub>Ca (s)\nHardness can thus be defined as the soap-consuming capacity of a water sample, or the capacity of precipitation of soap as a characteristic property of water that prevents the lathering of soap. Synthetic [[detergent]]s do not form such scums.\n[[File:Eifelwasserleitung05.jpg|right|thumb|210px|A portion of the ancient Roman [[Eifel aqueduct]] in Germany. After being in service for about 180 years, the aqueduct had mineral deposits of up to {{cvt|20|cm|0}} thick along the walls.]]\n\nHard water also forms deposits that clog plumbing. These deposits, called \"[[Fouling|scale]]\", are composed mainly of [[calcium carbonate]] (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), [[magnesium hydroxide]] (Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>), and [[calcium sulfate]] (CaSO<sub>4</sub>).<ref name=Ullmann/> Calcium and magnesium carbonates tend to be deposited as off-white solids on the inside surfaces of pipes and [[heat exchanger]]s. This precipitation (formation of an insoluble solid) is principally caused by thermal decomposition of bicarbonate ions but also happens in cases where the carbonate ion is at saturation concentration.<ref>[http://dnr.wi.gov/regulations/labcert/documents/training/basics-genchem.pdf Wisconisin DNR - Carbonate chemistry]</ref> The resulting build-up of scale restricts the flow of water in pipes. In boilers, the deposits impair the flow of heat into water, reducing the heating efficiency and allowing the metal boiler components to overheat. In a pressurized system, this overheating can lead to failure of the boiler.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chem1.com/CQ/hardwater.html |title=Hard water and water softening |accessdate=2007-10-08 |author=Stephen Lower |date=July 2007 |website= |publisher=}}</ref> The damage caused by calcium carbonate deposits varies on the crystalline form, for example, [[calcite]] or [[aragonite]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wrc.org.za/Knowledge%20Hub%20Documents/Water%20SA%20Journals/Manuscripts/1998/01/WaterSA_1998_01_jan98_p77.pdf |title=Scale reduction and scale modification effects induced by Zn |accessdate=2010-03-29 |author=PP Coetzee |month= |year=1998 |website= |publisher= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509172117/http://www.wrc.org.za/Knowledge%20Hub%20Documents/Water%20SA%20Journals/Manuscripts/1998/01/WaterSA_1998_01_jan98_p77.pdf |archive-date=2016-05-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe presence of [[ion]]s in an [[electrolyte]], in this case, hard water, can also lead to [[galvanic corrosion]], in which one metal will preferentially [[corrode]] when in contact with another type of metal, when both are in contact with an electrolyte. The softening of hard water by ion exchange does not increase its [[corrosivity]] ''per se''. Similarly, where lead plumbing is in use, softened water does not substantially increase [[Lead (element)|plumbo]]-solvency.<ref>{{Cite journal\n  | last1 = Sorg\n  | first1 = Thomas J.\n  | last2 = Schock\n  | first2 = Michael R.\n  | last3 = Lytle\n  | first3 = Darren A.\n  | title = Ion Exchange Softening: Effects on Metal Concentrations\n  | journal = Journal AWWA\n  | volume = 91\n  | issue = 8\n  | pages = 85\u201397\n  | date = August 1999\n  | url = http://apps.awwa.org/WaterLibrary/showabstract.aspx?an=JAW_0049877\n  | issn = 1551-8833\n  | doi = 10.1002/j.1551-8833.1999.tb08685.x\n  | access-date = 2010-11-23\n  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110726114419/http://apps.awwa.org/WaterLibrary/showabstract.aspx?an=JAW_0049877\n  | archive-date = 2011-07-26\n  | url-status = dead\n  }}</ref>\n\nIn swimming pools, hard water is manifested by a [[Turbidity|turbid]], or cloudy (milky), appearance to the water. Calcium and magnesium hydroxides are both soluble in water. The solubility of the hydroxides of the alkaline-earth metals to which calcium and magnesium belong ([[Periodic table#Groups|group 2 of the periodic table]]) increases moving down the column. Aqueous solutions of these metal hydroxides absorb carbon dioxide from the air, forming the insoluble carbonates, giving rise to the turbidity.  This often results from the [[pH]] being excessively high (pH&nbsp;>&nbsp;7.6). Hence, a common solution to the problem is, while maintaining the chlorine concentration at the proper level, to lower the pH by the addition of hydrochloric acid, the optimum value being in the range of 7.2 to 7.6.\n\n===Softening===\n{{Main|Water softening}}\nIt is often desirable to soften hard water. Most detergents contain ingredients that counteract the effects of hard water on the surfactants. For this reason, water softening is often unnecessary. Where softening is practiced, it is often recommended to soften only the water sent to domestic hot water systems so as to prevent or delay inefficiencies and damage due to scale formation in water heaters. A common method for water softening involves the use of [[ion exchange resin]]s, which replace ions like Ca<sup>2+</sup> by twice the number of monocations such as [[sodium]] or [[potassium]] ions.\n\n[[Washing soda]] ([[sodium carbonate]], Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) is easily obtained and has long been used as a water softener for domestic laundry, in conjunction with the usual soap or detergent.\n\n===Health considerations===\nThe [[World Health Organization]] says that \"there does not appear to be any convincing evidence that water hardness causes adverse health effects in humans\".<ref name=\"who\" /> In fact, the [[United States National Research Council]] has found that hard water actually serves as a dietary supplement for calcium and magnesium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.water-research.net/hardness.htm |title=Drinking Water Hardwater Hardness Calcium Magnesium Scale Stained Laundry |publisher=Water-research.net |date= |accessdate=2013-01-26}}</ref>\n\nSome studies have shown a weak [[inverse relationship]] between water hardness and [[cardiovascular disease]] in men, up to a level of 170&nbsp;mg calcium carbonate per litre of water.

The total water hardness is the sum of the [[molar concentration]]s of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>, in mol/L or mmol/L units. Although water hardness usually measures only the total concentrations of calcium and magnesium (the two most prevalent [[divalent]] metal ions), [[iron]], [[aluminium]], and [[manganese]] can also be present at elevated levels in some locations. The presence of iron characteristically confers a brownish ([[rust]]-like) colour to the calcification, instead of white (the color of most of the other compounds).\n\nWater hardness is often not expressed as a molar concentration, but rather in various units, such as degrees of general hardness ([[dGH]]), German degrees (\u00b0dH), parts per million (ppm, mg/L, or American degrees), grains per gallon (gpg), English degrees (\u00b0e, e, or [[Thomas Clark (chemist)|\u00b0Clark]]), or French degrees (\u00b0fH, \u00b0f or \u00b0HF; lowercase ''f'' is used to prevent confusion with degrees [[Fahrenheit]]). The table below shows conversion factors between the various units.\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Hardness unit conversion.\n|-\n!  || 1&nbsp;mmol/L || 1 ppm, mg/L || 1 dGH, \u00b0dH || 1 gpg || 1 \u00b0e, \u00b0Clark || 1 \u00b0fH\n|-\n! mmol/L  \n| 1        || 0.009991 || 0.1783   || 0.171    || 0.1424   || 0.09991   \n|-\n! ppm, mg/L    \n| 100.1    || 1        || 17.85    || 17.12    || 14.25    ||10\n|-\n! dGH, \u00b0dH\n| 5.608    || 0.05603  || 1        || 0.9591   || 0.7986   || 0.5603    \n|-\n! gpg     \n| 5.847    || 0.05842  || 1.043    || 1        || 0.8327   || 0.5842    \n|-\n! \u00b0e, \u00b0Clark\n| 7.022    || 0.07016  || 1.252    || 1.201    || 1        || 0.7016    \n|-\n! \u00b0fH     \n| 10.01    ||0.1|| 1.785    || 1.712    || 1.425    || 1         \n|}\nThe various alternative units represent an equivalent mass of calcium oxide (CaO) or calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) that, when dissolved in a unit volume of pure water, would result in the same total molar concentration of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The different conversion factors arise from the fact that equivalent masses of calcium oxide and calcium carbonates differ, and that different mass and volume units are used. The units are as follows:\n* ''Parts per million (ppm)'' is usually defined as 1&nbsp;mg/L CaCO<sub>3</sub> (the definition used below).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thekrib.com/Plants/CO2/hardness-larryfrank.html|title=Water Hardness|work=thekrib.com}}</ref> It is equivalent to '''mg/L''' without chemical compound specified, and to '''American degree'''.\n* ''[[Grains per Gallon]] (gpg)'' is defined as 1 [[Grain (measure)|grain]] (64.8&nbsp;mg) of calcium carbonate per [[U.S. gallon]] (3.79 litres), or 17.118 ppm.\n* a ''mmol/L'' is equivalent to 100.09&nbsp;mg/L CaCO<sub>3</sub> or 40.08&nbsp;mg/L Ca<sup>2+</sup>.\n* A ''degree of General Hardness ([[dGH]]'' or 'German degree (\u00b0dH, ''deutsche H\u00e4rte''))' is defined as 10&nbsp;mg/L CaO or 17.848 ppm.\n* A ''Clark degree (\u00b0Clark)'' or ''English degrees (\u00b0e or e)'' is defined as one [[Grain (measure)|grain]] (64.8&nbsp;mg) of CaCO<sub>3</sub> per [[Imperial gallon]] (4.55 litres) of water, equivalent to 14.254 ppm.\n* A ''French degree (\u00b0fH or \u00b0f)'' is defined as 10&nbsp;mg/L CaCO<sub>3</sub>, equivalent to 10 ppm.\n\n===Hard/soft classification===\nAs it is the precise mixture of minerals dissolved in the water, together with the water's [[pH]] and temperature, that determine the behavior of the hardness, a single-number scale does not adequately describe hardness. However, the [[United States Geological Survey]] uses the following classification into hard and soft water,<ref name=USGS>{{cite web|url=http://water.usgs.gov/owq/hardness-alkalinity.html|title=USGS Water-Quality Information: Water Hardness and Alkalinity|author=USGS - U.S. Geological Survey Office of Water Quality|work=usgs.gov}}</ref>\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

A scale layer of CaCO<sub>3</sub> is neither precipitated nor dissolved.\n* For LSI < 0, water is under saturated and tends to dissolve solid CaCO<sub>3</sub>.\n\nIf the actual pH of the water is below the calculated saturation pH, the LSI is negative and the water has a very limited scaling potential. If the actual pH exceeds pHs, the LSI is positive, and being supersaturated with CaCO<sub>3</sub>, the water has a tendency to form scale. At increasing positive index values, the scaling potential increases.\n\nIn practice, water with an LSI between \u22120.5 and +0.5 will not display enhanced mineral dissolving or scale forming properties. Water with an LSI below \u22120.5 tends to exhibit noticeably increased dissolving abilities while water with an LSI above +0.5 tends to exhibit noticeably increased scale forming properties.\n\nThe LSI is temperature sensitive. The LSI becomes more positive as the water temperature increases. This has particular implications in situations where well water is used. The temperature of the water when it first exits the well is often significantly lower than the temperature inside the building served by the well or at the laboratory where the LSI measurement is made. This increase in temperature can cause scaling, especially in cases such as hot water heaters. Conversely, systems that reduce water temperature will have less scaling.\n:   Water Analysis:\n::        pH = 7.5\n::        TDS = 320&nbsp;mg/L\n::        Calcium = 150&nbsp;mg/L (or ppm) as CaCO<sub>3</sub>\n::        Alkalinity = 34&nbsp;mg/L (or ppm) as CaCO<sub>3</sub>\n\n:    LSI formula:\n::      LSI = pH \u2212 pH<sub>s</sub>\n::      pH<sub>s</sub> = (9.3 + A + B) \u2212 (C + D) where:\n::        A = {{sfrac|log<sub>10</sub>[TDS] \u2212 1|10}} = 0.15\n::        B = \u221213.12 \u00d7 log<sub>10</sub>(\u00b0C + 273) + 34.55 = 2.09 at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C and 1.09 at 82&nbsp;\u00b0C\n::        C = log<sub>10</sub>[Ca<sup>2+</sup> as CaCO<sub>3</sub>] - 0.4 = 1.78         \n:::           (Ca<sup>2+</sup> as CaCO<sub>3</sub> is also called calcium hardness, and is calculated as 2.5[Ca<sup>2+</sup>])\n::        D = log<sub>10</sub>[alkalinity as CaCO<sub>3</sub>] = 1.53\n\n====Ryznar Stability Index (RSI)====\nThe Ryznar stability index (RSI)<ref name=\"McTigueSymons2011\" />{{rp|525}} uses a database of scale thickness measurements in municipal water systems to predict the effect of water chemistry.<ref name=\"Reid2003\" />{{rp|72}}<ref name=\"Emerson2003\">{{cite book|last=Emerson|first=A.

[[Wales]], [[Devon]], [[Cornwall]] and parts of [[North West England|northwest England]] are softer water areas, and range from 0 to 200 ppm.<ref>[http://www.anglianwater.co.uk/_assets/media/Hard_Water_Bro_16-3-09_12PP.pdf anglianwater.co.uk]</ref> In the [[brewing]] industry in England and Wales, water is often deliberately hardened with [[gypsum]] in the process of [[Burtonisation]].\n\nGenerally water is mostly hard in urban areas of England where soft water sources are unavailable. A number of cities built water supply sources in the 18th century as the [[industrial revolution]] and urban population burgeoned. [[Manchester]] was a notable such city in North West England and its wealthy corporation built a number of reservoirs at [[Thirlmere]] and [[Haweswater]] in the [[Lake District]] to the north. There is no exposure to [[limestone]] or [[chalk]] in their [[headwaters]] and consequently the water in Manchester is rated as 'very soft'.<ref name=\"manchester\"/> Similarly, tap water in [[Birmingham]] is also soft as it is sourced from the [[Elan Valley Reservoirs]] in Wales, even though groundwater in the area is hard.\n\n=== In Ireland ===\nThe EPA has published a standards handbook for the interpretation of water quality in Ireland in which definitions of water hardness are given.<ref>Section 36 \"Hardness\" https://www.epa.ie/pubs/advice/water/quality/Water_Quality.pdf</ref>\nIn this section, reference to original EU documentation is given, which sets out no limit for hardness.\nIn turn, the handbook also gives no \"Recommended or Mandatory Limit Values\" for hardness.\nThe handbooks does indicate that above the midpoint of the ranges defined as \"Moderately Hard\", effects are seen increasingly: \"The chief disadvantages of hard waters are that they neutralise the lathering power of soap.... and, more important, that they can cause blockage of pipes and severely reduced boiler efficiency because of scale formation. These effects will increase as the hardness rises to and beyond 200 mg/l CaCO3.\"\n\n=== In the United States ===\nA collection of data from the United States found that about half the water stations tested had hardness over 120&nbsp;mg per litre of calcium carbonate equivalent, placing them in the categories \"hard\" or \"very hard\".<ref name=USGS/> The other half were classified as soft or moderately hard. More than 85% of American homes have hard water.<ref>{{cite web |last=Wilson |first=Amber |last2=Parrott |first2=Kathleen |last3=Ross |first3=Blake |title=Household Water Quality \u2013 Water Hardness |url=http://www.aquasafecanada.com/mirror/household-water-quality-water-hardness.htm |date=June 1999 |accessdate=2009-04-26}}</ref> The softest waters occur in parts of the [[New England]], South Atlantic-Gulf, [[Pacific Northwest]], and [[Hawaii]] regions. Moderately hard waters are common in many of the rivers of the [[Tennessee]], [[Great Lakes]], and Alaska regions. Hard and very hard waters are found in some of the streams in most of the regions throughout the country. The hardest waters (greater than 1,000 ppm) are in streams in Texas, New Mexico, Kansas, Arizona, Utah, parts of Colorado, southern Nevada, and southern California.<ref>Briggs, J.C., and Ficke, J.F.; ''Quality of Rivers of the United States, 1975 Water Year -- Based on the National Stream Quality Accounting Network (NASQAN)'': U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 78-200, 436 p.

This happened about 323 million years ago, at the onset of the [[Permo-Carboniferous Glaciation]].{{sfn|Stanley|1999}}\n\nThe Carboniferous was a time of active [[orogeny|mountain-building]] as the [[supercontinent]] [[Pangaea]] came together. The southern [[continent]]s remained tied together in the supercontinent Gondwana, which collided with North America\u2013Europe ([[Laurussia]]) along the present line of eastern North America. This continental collision resulted in the [[Variscan orogeny|Hercynian orogeny]] in Europe, and the [[Alleghenian orogeny]] in North America; it also extended the newly uplifted [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]] southwestward as the [[Ouachita Mountains]].{{sfn|Stanley|1999}} In the same time frame, much of present eastern [[Eurasian plate]] welded itself to Europe along the line of the [[Ural Mountains]]. Most of the [[Mesozoic]] supercontinent of Pangea was now assembled, although North China (which would collide in the Latest Carboniferous), and [[South China (continent)|South China]] continents were still separated from [[Laurasia]]. The Late Carboniferous Pangaea was shaped like an \"O.\"\n\nThere were two major oceans in the Carboniferous\u2014[[Panthalassa]] and [[Paleo-Tethys]], which was inside the \"O\" in the Carboniferous Pangaea. Other minor oceans were shrinking and eventually closed - [[Rheic Ocean]] (closed by the assembly of [[South America|South]] and [[North America]]), the small, shallow [[Ural Ocean]] (which was closed by the collision of [[Baltica]] and Siberia continents, creating the [[Ural Mountains]]) and [[Proto-Tethys Ocean]] (closed by [[North China (continent)|North China]] collision with [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]]/[[Kazakhstania]]).\n\n==Climate==\nAverage global temperatures in the Early Carboniferous Period were high: approximately 20&nbsp;\u00b0C (68&nbsp;\u00b0F). However, cooling during the Middle Carboniferous reduced average global temperatures to about 12&nbsp;\u00b0C (54&nbsp;\u00b0F). Lack of growth rings of fossilized trees suggest a lack of seasons of a tropical climate. Glaciations in [[Gondwana]], triggered by Gondwana's southward movement, continued into the [[Permian]] and because of the lack of clear markers and breaks, the deposits of this glacial period are often referred to as [[Permo-Carboniferous]] in age.\n\nThe cooling and drying of the climate led to the [[Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse]] (CRC) during the late Carboniferous. Tropical rainforests fragmented and then were eventually devastated by climate change.<ref name=\"SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse\"/>\n\n==Rocks and coal==\n[[File:MississippianMarbleUT.JPG|thumb|right|Lower Carboniferous marble in Big Cottonwood Canyon, [[Wasatch Mountains]], [[Utah]].]]\nCarboniferous rocks in Europe and eastern North America largely consist of a repeated sequence of [[limestone]], [[sandstone]], [[shale]] and [[coal]] beds.{{sfn|Stanley|1999|p=426}} In North America, the early Carboniferous is largely marine limestone, which accounts for the division of the Carboniferous into two periods in North American schemes. The Carboniferous coal beds provided much of the fuel for power generation during the [[Industrial Revolution]] and are still of great economic importance.\n\nThe large coal deposits of the Carboniferous may owe their existence primarily to two factors. The first of these is the appearance of [[wood]] tissue and [[bark (botany)|bark]]-bearing trees. The [[evolution]] of the wood fiber [[lignin]] and the bark-sealing, waxy substance [[suberin]] variously opposed decay organisms so effectively that dead materials accumulated long enough to fossilise on a large scale. The second factor was the lower sea levels that occurred during the Carboniferous as compared to the preceding [[Devonian]] period. This promoted the development of extensive lowland [[swamp]]s and [[forest]]s in North America and Europe. Based on a genetic analysis of mushroom fungi, it was proposed that large quantities of [[wood]] were buried during this period because animals and decomposing [[bacteria]] and fungi had not yet [[Evolution|evolved]] enzymes that could effectively digest the resistant phenolic lignin polymers and waxy suberin polymers. They suggest that fungi that could break those substances down effectively only became dominant towards the end of the period, making subsequent coal formation much rarer.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Floudas|first1=D.|last2=Binder|first2=M.|last3=Riley|first3=R.|last4=Barry|first4=K.|last5=Blanchette|first5=R.

They had bark to wood ratios of 8 to 1, and even as high as 20 to 1. This compares to modern values less than 1 to 4. This bark, which must have been used as support as well as protection, probably had 38% to 58% lignin. Lignin is insoluble, too large to pass through cell walls, too heterogeneous for specific enzymes, and toxic, so that few organisms other than [[Basidiomycetes]] fungi can degrade it. To oxidize it requires an atmosphere of greater than 5% oxygen, or compounds such as peroxides. It can linger in soil for thousands of years and its toxic breakdown products inhibit decay of other substances.{{sfn|Robinson |1990 |p=608}} One possible reason for its high percentages in plants at that time was to provide protection from insects in a world containing very effective insect herbivores (but nothing remotely as effective as modern plant eating insects) and probably many fewer protective toxins produced naturally by plants than exist today. As a result, undegraded carbon built up, resulting in the extensive burial of biologically fixed [[carbon]], leading to an increase in [[oxygen]] levels in the atmosphere; estimates place the peak oxygen content as high as 35%, as compared to 21% today.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.highbeam.com/library/docfree.asp?DOCID=1G1:16907261&ctrlInfo=Round20:Mode20b:DocG:Result&ao=|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130103013012/http://www.highbeam.com/library/docfree.asp?DOCID=1G1:16907261&ctrlInfo=Round20:Mode20b:DocG:Result&ao=|url-status=dead|archive-date=3 January 2013|title=Ancient Animals Got a Rise out of Oxygen|date=13 May 1995|website=highbeam.com|accessdate=1 May 2018}}</ref> This oxygen level may have increased [[wildfire]] activity.

More diverse geology existed elsewhere, of course. Marine life is especially rich in [[crinoids]] and other [[echinodermata|echinoderms]]. [[Brachiopoda|Brachiopods]] were abundant. [[Trilobite]]s became quite uncommon. On land, large and diverse [[plant]] populations existed. Land [[vertebrata|vertebrates]] included large amphibians.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Marine invertebrates===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\nIn the oceans the [[marine invertebrate]] groups are the [[Foraminifera]], [[Anthozoa|corals]], [[Bryozoa]], [[Ostracoda]], [[brachiopod]]s, [[Ammonoidea|ammonoids]], [[hederellid|hederelloids]], [[microconchids]] and [[echinoderm]]s (especially [[crinoid]]s). For the first time foraminifera take a prominent part in the marine faunas. The large spindle-shaped genus ''Fusulina'' and its relatives were abundant in what is now Russia, China, Japan, North America; other important genera include ''Valvulina'', ''Endothyra'', ''Archaediscus'', and ''Saccammina'' (the latter common in Britain and Belgium). Some Carboniferous genera are still [[Extant taxon|extant]].\n\nThe microscopic shells of [[radiolaria]]ns are found in [[chert]]s of this age in the [[Culm Measures|Culm]] of [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]], and in Russia, Germany and elsewhere. [[Porifera|Sponges]] are known from [[spicule (sponge)|spicule]]s and anchor ropes, and include various forms such as the Calcispongea ''Cotyliscus'' and ''Girtycoelia'', the [[demosponge]] ''Chaetetes'', and the genus of unusual colonial [[Hyalospongea|glass sponges]] ''[[Titusvillia]]''.\n\nBoth [[reef]]-building and solitary corals diversify and flourish; these include both [[Rugosa|rugose]] (for example, ''[[Caninia (genus)|Caninia]]'', ''Corwenia'', ''Neozaphrentis''), heterocorals, and [[Tabulata|tabulate]] (for example, ''Chladochonus'', ''Michelinia'') forms. [[Conularids]] were well represented by ''Conularia''\n\n[[Bryozoa]] are abundant in some regions; the fenestellids including ''Fenestella'', ''Polypora'', and ''[[Archimedes (bryozoan)|Archimedes]]'', so named because it is in the shape of an [[Archimedean screw]]. [[Brachiopod]]s are also abundant; they include [[Productida|productids]], some of which (for example, ''[[Gigantoproductus]]'') reached very large (for brachiopods) size and had very thick shells, while others like ''[[Chonetes]]'' were more conservative in form. [[Athyridida|Athyridids]], [[Spiriferida|spiriferids]], [[Rhynchonellida|rhynchonellids]], and [[Terebratulida|terebratulids]] are also very common. Inarticulate forms include ''[[Discina (brachiopod)|Discina]]'' and ''[[Crania (genus)|Crania]]''. Some species and genera had a very wide distribution with only minor variations.\n\n[[Annelid]]s such as ''Serpulites'' are common fossils in some horizons. Among the mollusca, the [[bivalve]]s continue to increase in numbers and importance. Typical genera include ''[[Aviculopecten]]'', ''[[Posidonomya]]'', ''[[Nucula]]'', ''[[Carbonicola]]'', ''Edmondia'', and ''Modiola''. [[Gastropod]]s are also numerous, including the genera ''Murchisonia'', ''[[Euomphalus]]'', ''Naticopsis''. [[Nautiloid]] [[cephalopod]]s are represented by tightly coiled [[Nautilida|nautilids]], with straight-shelled and curved-shelled forms becoming increasingly rare. [[Goniatite]] [[Ammonoidea|ammonoids]] are common.\n\n[[Trilobite]]s are rarer than in previous periods, on a steady trend towards extinction, represented only by the proetid group. [[Ostracod]]a, a class of [[crustacean]]s, were abundant as representatives of the [[meiobenthos]]; genera included ''Amphissites'', ''Bairdia'', ''Beyrichiopsis'', ''Cavellina'', ''Coryellina'', ''Cribroconcha'', ''Hollinella'', ''Kirkbya'', ''Knoxiella'', and ''Libumella''.\n\nAmongst the [[echinoderm]]s, the [[crinoid]]s were the most numerous. Dense submarine thickets of long-stemmed crinoids appear to have flourished in shallow seas, and their remains were consolidated into thick beds of rock. Prominent genera include ''Cyathocrinus'', ''Woodocrinus'', and ''Actinocrinus''. Echinoids such as ''[[Archaeocidaris]]'' and ''Palaeechinus'' were also present. The [[blastoid]]s, which included the Pentreinitidae and Codasteridae and superficially resembled crinoids in the possession of long stalks attached to the seabed, attain their maximum development at this time.\n\n<center>\n<gallery>\nImage:Aviculopecten subcardiformis01.JPG|''Aviculopecten subcardiformis''; a [[bivalve]] from the [[Logan Formation]] (Lower Carboniferous) of [[Wooster, Ohio]] (external mold).\nImage:LoganFauna011312.jpg|Bivalves (''Aviculopecten'') and brachiopods (''Syringothyris'') in the Logan Formation (Lower Carboniferous) in Wooster, Ohio.\nImage:Syringothyris01.JPG|''Syringothyris'' sp.; a spiriferid [[brachiopod]] from the Logan Formation (Lower Carboniferous) of Wooster, Ohio (internal mold).\nImage:Palaeophycus01.JPG|''Palaeophycus'' ichnosp.; a [[trace fossil]] from the Logan Formation (Lower Carboniferous) of Wooster, Ohio.\nImage:PlatyceratidMississippian.JPG|[[Crinoid]] calyx from the Lower Carboniferous of Ohio with a conical [[Platyceratidae|platyceratid]] gastropod (''Palaeocapulus acutirostre'') attached.\nImage:Conulariid03.jpg|Conulariid from the Lower Carboniferous of Indiana.\nImage:Syringoporid.jpg|Tabulate coral (a syringoporid); Boone Limestone (Lower Carboniferous) near Hiwasse, Arkansas.\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n===Freshwater and lagoonal invertebrates===\nFreshwater Carboniferous invertebrates include various [[bivalve]] [[mollusc]]s that lived in brackish or fresh water, such as ''[[Anthraconaia]]'', ''[[Naiadites]]'', and ''[[Carbonicola]]''; diverse [[crustacean]]s such as ''[[Candona]]'', ''[[Carbonita (genus)|Carbonita]]'', ''[[Darwinula]]'', ''[[Estheria (crustacean)|Estheria]]'', ''[[Acanthocaris]]'', ''[[Dithyrocaris]]'', and ''[[Anthrapalaemon]]''.\n\n[[File:Megarachne BW.jpg|thumb|The upper Carboniferous giant spider-like eurypterid ''[[Megarachne]]'' grew to legspans of {{convert|50|cm|0|abbr=on}}.]]\nThe [[eurypterid]]s were also diverse, and are represented by such genera as ''[[Adelophthalmus]]'', ''[[Megarachne]]'' (originally misinterpreted as a giant spider, hence its name) and the specialised very large ''[[Hibbertopterus]]''. Many of these were amphibious.\n\nFrequently a temporary return of marine conditions resulted in marine or brackish water genera such as ''[[Lingula (genus)|Lingula]]'', [[Orbiculoidea]], and ''[[Productus]]'' being found in the thin beds known as marine bands.\n\n===Terrestrial invertebrates===\nFossil remains of air-breathing [[insect]]s,{{sfn|Garwood|Sutton|2010}} [[myriapod]]s and [[arachnid]]s{{sfn| Garwood |Dunlop |Sutton |2009}} are known from the late Carboniferous, but so far not from the early Carboniferous.{{sfn| Garwood |Edgecombe |2011}} The first true [[priapulid]]s appeared during this period. Their diversity when they do appear, however, shows that these arthropods were both well developed and numerous. Their large size can be attributed to the moistness of the environment (mostly swampy fern forests) and the fact that the oxygen concentration in the Earth's atmosphere in the Carboniferous was much higher than today.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Can Oxygen Set Thermal Limits in an Insect and Drive Gigantism? |last1=Verberk |first1=Wilco C.E.P. |last2=Bilton |first2=David T. |date=July 27, 2011 |journal=PLOS One |volume=6 |issue=7 |pages = e22610|df= |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0022610|pmid = 21818347|pmc=3144910 |bibcode=2011PLoSO...622610V }}</ref> This required less effort for respiration and allowed [[Arthropoda|arthropods]] to grow larger with the up to {{convert|2.6|m|ft|sp=us|adj=mid|-long}} millipede-like ''[[Arthropleura]]'' being the largest-known land invertebrate of all time.

These included some, like ''[[Psammodus]]'', with crushing pavement-like teeth adapted for grinding the shells of brachiopods, crustaceans, and other marine organisms. Other sharks had piercing teeth, such as the [[Symmoriida]]; some, the [[petalodont]]s, had peculiar cycloid cutting teeth. Most of the sharks were marine, but the [[Xenacanthida]] invaded fresh waters of the coal swamps. Among the [[Osteichthyes|bony fish]], the [[Palaeonisciformes]] found in coastal waters also appear to have migrated to rivers. [[Sarcopterygii|Sarcopterygia]]n fish were also prominent, and one group, the [[Rhizodont]]s, reached very large size.\n\nMost species of Carboniferous marine fish have been described largely from teeth, fin spines and dermal ossicles, with smaller freshwater fish preserved whole.\n\nFreshwater fish were abundant, and include the genera ''[[Ctenodus]]'', ''[[Uronemus]]'', ''[[Acanthodes]]'', ''[[Cheirodus]]'', and ''[[Gyracanthus]]''.\n\n[[Shark]]s (especially the ''Stethacanthids'') underwent a major [[evolutionary radiation]] during the Carboniferous.<ref name=goldsharks/> It is believed that this evolutionary radiation occurred because the decline of the [[Placodermi|placoderms]] at the end of the Devonian period caused many [[Niche (ecology)|environmental niches]] to become unoccupied and allowed new organisms to evolve and fill these niches.<ref name=goldsharks/> As a result of the evolutionary radiation Carboniferous sharks assumed a wide variety of bizarre shapes including ''[[Stethacanthus]]'' which possessed a flat brush-like dorsal fin with a patch of [[Dermal denticle|denticles]] on its top.<ref name=goldsharks/> ''[[Stethacanthus]]''{{'s}} unusual fin may have been used in mating rituals.<ref name=goldsharks>{{cite web |url=http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/evolution/golden_age.htm |title=A Golden Age of Sharks |accessdate=2008-06-23 |website=Biology of Sharks and Rays {{!}} ReefQuest Centre for Shark Research |first=R.

These had long bodies, a head covered with bony plates and generally weak or undeveloped limbs. The largest were over 2 meters long. They were accompanied by an assemblage of smaller amphibians included under the [[Lepospondyli]], often only about {{convert|15|cm|0|abbr=on}} long. Some Carboniferous amphibians were aquatic and lived in rivers (''[[Loxomma]]'', ''[[Eogyrinus]]'', ''[[Proterogyrinus]]''); others may have been semi-aquatic (''[[Ophiderpeton]]'', ''[[Amphibamus]]'', ''[[Hyloplesion]]'') or terrestrial (''[[Dendrerpeton]]'', ''[[Tuditanus]]'', ''[[Anthracosaurus]]'').\n\nThe [[Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse]] slowed the evolution of amphibians who could not survive as well in the cooler, drier conditions. Reptiles, however, prospered due to specific key adaptations.<ref name=\"SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse\"/> One of the greatest evolutionary innovations of the Carboniferous was the [[amniote]] egg, which allowed the laying of eggs in a dry environment, allowing for the further exploitation of the land by certain [[tetrapod]]s. These included the earliest [[Sauropsida|sauropsid]] reptiles (''[[Hylonomus]]''), and the earliest known [[synapsid]] (''[[Archaeothyris]]''). These small lizard-like animals quickly gave rise to many descendants, [[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s, and [[mammal]]s.\n\nReptiles underwent a major evolutionary radiation in response to the drier climate that preceded the rainforest collapse.<ref name=\"SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse\"/><ref name=Kazlev>{{cite web |first=M.

This happened about 323 million years ago, at the onset of the [[Permo-Carboniferous Glaciation]].{{sfn|Stanley|1999}}\n\nThe Carboniferous was a time of active [[orogeny|mountain-building]] as the [[supercontinent]] [[Pangaea]] came together. The southern [[continent]]s remained tied together in the supercontinent Gondwana, which collided with North America\u2013Europe ([[Laurussia]]) along the present line of eastern North America. This continental collision resulted in the [[Variscan orogeny|Hercynian orogeny]] in Europe, and the [[Alleghenian orogeny]] in North America; it also extended the newly uplifted [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]] southwestward as the [[Ouachita Mountains]].{{sfn|Stanley|1999}} In the same time frame, much of present eastern [[Eurasian plate]] welded itself to Europe along the line of the [[Ural Mountains]]. Most of the [[Mesozoic]] supercontinent of Pangea was now assembled, although North China (which would collide in the Latest Carboniferous), and [[South China (continent)|South China]] continents were still separated from [[Laurasia]]. The Late Carboniferous Pangaea was shaped like an \"O.\"\n\nThere were two major oceans in the Carboniferous\u2014[[Panthalassa]] and [[Paleo-Tethys]], which was inside the \"O\" in the Carboniferous Pangaea. Other minor oceans were shrinking and eventually closed - [[Rheic Ocean]] (closed by the assembly of [[South America|South]] and [[North America]]), the small, shallow [[Ural Ocean]] (which was closed by the collision of [[Baltica]] and Siberia continents, creating the [[Ural Mountains]]) and [[Proto-Tethys Ocean]] (closed by [[North China (continent)|North China]] collision with [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]]/[[Kazakhstania]]).\n\n==Climate==\nAverage global temperatures in the Early Carboniferous Period were high: approximately 20&nbsp;\u00b0C (68&nbsp;\u00b0F). However, cooling during the Middle Carboniferous reduced average global temperatures to about 12&nbsp;\u00b0C (54&nbsp;\u00b0F). Lack of growth rings of fossilized trees suggest a lack of seasons of a tropical climate. Glaciations in [[Gondwana]], triggered by Gondwana's southward movement, continued into the [[Permian]] and because of the lack of clear markers and breaks, the deposits of this glacial period are often referred to as [[Permo-Carboniferous]] in age.\n\nThe cooling and drying of the climate led to the [[Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse]] (CRC) during the late Carboniferous. Tropical rainforests fragmented and then were eventually devastated by climate change.<ref name=\"SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse\"/>\n\n==Rocks and coal==\n[[File:MississippianMarbleUT.JPG|thumb|right|Lower Carboniferous marble in Big Cottonwood Canyon, [[Wasatch Mountains]], [[Utah]].]]\nCarboniferous rocks in Europe and eastern North America largely consist of a repeated sequence of [[limestone]], [[sandstone]], [[shale]] and [[coal]] beds.{{sfn|Stanley|1999|p=426}} In North America, the early Carboniferous is largely marine limestone, which accounts for the division of the Carboniferous into two periods in North American schemes. The Carboniferous coal beds provided much of the fuel for power generation during the [[Industrial Revolution]] and are still of great economic importance.\n\nThe large coal deposits of the Carboniferous may owe their existence primarily to two factors. The first of these is the appearance of [[wood]] tissue and [[bark (botany)|bark]]-bearing trees. The [[evolution]] of the wood fiber [[lignin]] and the bark-sealing, waxy substance [[suberin]] variously opposed decay organisms so effectively that dead materials accumulated long enough to fossilise on a large scale. The second factor was the lower sea levels that occurred during the Carboniferous as compared to the preceding [[Devonian]] period. This promoted the development of extensive lowland [[swamp]]s and [[forest]]s in North America and Europe. Based on a genetic analysis of mushroom fungi, it was proposed that large quantities of [[wood]] were buried during this period because animals and decomposing [[bacteria]] and fungi had not yet [[Evolution|evolved]] enzymes that could effectively digest the resistant phenolic lignin polymers and waxy suberin polymers. They suggest that fungi that could break those substances down effectively only became dominant towards the end of the period, making subsequent coal formation much rarer.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Floudas|first1=D.|last2=Binder|first2=M.|last3=Riley|first3=R.|last4=Barry|first4=K.|last5=Blanchette|first5=R.

They had bark to wood ratios of 8 to 1, and even as high as 20 to 1. This compares to modern values less than 1 to 4. This bark, which must have been used as support as well as protection, probably had 38% to 58% lignin. Lignin is insoluble, too large to pass through cell walls, too heterogeneous for specific enzymes, and toxic, so that few organisms other than [[Basidiomycetes]] fungi can degrade it. To oxidize it requires an atmosphere of greater than 5% oxygen, or compounds such as peroxides. It can linger in soil for thousands of years and its toxic breakdown products inhibit decay of other substances.{{sfn|Robinson |1990 |p=608}} One possible reason for its high percentages in plants at that time was to provide protection from insects in a world containing very effective insect herbivores (but nothing remotely as effective as modern plant eating insects) and probably many fewer protective toxins produced naturally by plants than exist today. As a result, undegraded carbon built up, resulting in the extensive burial of biologically fixed [[carbon]], leading to an increase in [[oxygen]] levels in the atmosphere; estimates place the peak oxygen content as high as 35%, as compared to 21% today.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.highbeam.com/library/docfree.asp?DOCID=1G1:16907261&ctrlInfo=Round20:Mode20b:DocG:Result&ao=|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130103013012/http://www.highbeam.com/library/docfree.asp?DOCID=1G1:16907261&ctrlInfo=Round20:Mode20b:DocG:Result&ao=|url-status=dead|archive-date=3 January 2013|title=Ancient Animals Got a Rise out of Oxygen|date=13 May 1995|website=highbeam.com|accessdate=1 May 2018}}</ref> This oxygen level may have increased [[wildfire]] activity.

Unlike present-day trees, their [[secondary growth]] took place in the [[Cortex (botany)|cortex]], which also provided stability, instead of the [[xylem]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uni-muenster.de/GeoPalaeontologie/Palaeo/Palbot/ewald1.htm |title=A History of Palaeozoic Forests - Part 2 The Carboniferous coal swamp forests |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920012606/http://www.uni-muenster.de/GeoPalaeontologie/Palaeo/Palbot/ewald1.htm |website=Forschungsstelle f\u00fcr Pal\u00e4obotanik |publisher=Westf\u00e4lische Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnster |archive-date=2012-09-20 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The [[Cladoxylopsida|Cladoxylopsids]] were large trees, that were ancestors of ferns, first arising in the Carboniferous.<ref>{{cite web |first=C.

Probably many species were [[epiphytic]]. Fossil ferns and \"seed ferns\" include ''[[Pecopteris]]'', ''[[Cyclopteris]]'', ''[[Neuropteris]]'', ''[[Alethopteris]]'', and ''[[Sphenopteris]]''; ''[[Megaphyton]]'' and ''[[Caulopteris]]'' were tree ferns.\n\nThe Equisetales included the common giant form ''[[Calamites]]'', with a trunk diameter of 30 to {{convert|60|cm|0|abbr=on}} and a height of up to {{convert|20|m|0|abbr=on}}. ''[[Sphenophyllum]]'' was a slender climbing plant with whorls of leaves, which was probably related both to the calamites and the lycopods.\n\n''[[Cordaites]]'', a tall plant (6 to over 30 meters) with strap-like leaves, was related to the cycads and conifers; the [[catkin]]-like reproductive organs, which bore ovules/seeds, is called ''[[Cardiocarpus]]''. These plants were thought to live in swamps. True coniferous trees (''[[Walchia]]'', of the order Voltziales) appear later in the Carboniferous, and preferred higher drier ground.\n\n===Marine invertebrates===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\nIn the oceans the [[marine invertebrate]] groups are the [[Foraminifera]], [[Anthozoa|corals]], [[Bryozoa]], [[Ostracoda]], [[brachiopod]]s, [[Ammonoidea|ammonoids]], [[hederellid|hederelloids]], [[microconchids]] and [[echinoderm]]s (especially [[crinoid]]s). For the first time foraminifera take a prominent part in the marine faunas. The large spindle-shaped genus ''Fusulina'' and its relatives were abundant in what is now Russia, China, Japan, North America; other important genera include ''Valvulina'', ''Endothyra'', ''Archaediscus'', and ''Saccammina'' (the latter common in Britain and Belgium). Some Carboniferous genera are still [[Extant taxon|extant]].\n\nThe microscopic shells of [[radiolaria]]ns are found in [[chert]]s of this age in the [[Culm Measures|Culm]] of [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]], and in Russia, Germany and elsewhere. [[Porifera|Sponges]] are known from [[spicule (sponge)|spicule]]s and anchor ropes, and include various forms such as the Calcispongea ''Cotyliscus'' and ''Girtycoelia'', the [[demosponge]] ''Chaetetes'', and the genus of unusual colonial [[Hyalospongea|glass sponges]] ''[[Titusvillia]]''.\n\nBoth [[reef]]-building and solitary corals diversify and flourish; these include both [[Rugosa|rugose]] (for example, ''[[Caninia (genus)|Caninia]]'', ''Corwenia'', ''Neozaphrentis''), heterocorals, and [[Tabulata|tabulate]] (for example, ''Chladochonus'', ''Michelinia'') forms. [[Conularids]] were well represented by ''Conularia''\n\n[[Bryozoa]] are abundant in some regions; the fenestellids including ''Fenestella'', ''Polypora'', and ''[[Archimedes (bryozoan)|Archimedes]]'', so named because it is in the shape of an [[Archimedean screw]]. [[Brachiopod]]s are also abundant; they include [[Productida|productids]], some of which (for example, ''[[Gigantoproductus]]'') reached very large (for brachiopods) size and had very thick shells, while others like ''[[Chonetes]]'' were more conservative in form. [[Athyridida|Athyridids]], [[Spiriferida|spiriferids]], [[Rhynchonellida|rhynchonellids]], and [[Terebratulida|terebratulids]] are also very common. Inarticulate forms include ''[[Discina (brachiopod)|Discina]]'' and ''[[Crania (genus)|Crania]]''. Some species and genera had a very wide distribution with only minor variations.\n\n[[Annelid]]s such as ''Serpulites'' are common fossils in some horizons. Among the mollusca, the [[bivalve]]s continue to increase in numbers and importance. Typical genera include ''[[Aviculopecten]]'', ''[[Posidonomya]]'', ''[[Nucula]]'', ''[[Carbonicola]]'', ''Edmondia'', and ''Modiola''. [[Gastropod]]s are also numerous, including the genera ''Murchisonia'', ''[[Euomphalus]]'', ''Naticopsis''. [[Nautiloid]] [[cephalopod]]s are represented by tightly coiled [[Nautilida|nautilids]], with straight-shelled and curved-shelled forms becoming increasingly rare. [[Goniatite]] [[Ammonoidea|ammonoids]] are common.\n\n[[Trilobite]]s are rarer than in previous periods, on a steady trend towards extinction, represented only by the proetid group. [[Ostracod]]a, a class of [[crustacean]]s, were abundant as representatives of the [[meiobenthos]]; genera included ''Amphissites'', ''Bairdia'', ''Beyrichiopsis'', ''Cavellina'', ''Coryellina'', ''Cribroconcha'', ''Hollinella'', ''Kirkbya'', ''Knoxiella'', and ''Libumella''.\n\nAmongst the [[echinoderm]]s, the [[crinoid]]s were the most numerous. Dense submarine thickets of long-stemmed crinoids appear to have flourished in shallow seas, and their remains were consolidated into thick beds of rock. Prominent genera include ''Cyathocrinus'', ''Woodocrinus'', and ''Actinocrinus''. Echinoids such as ''[[Archaeocidaris]]'' and ''Palaeechinus'' were also present. The [[blastoid]]s, which included the Pentreinitidae and Codasteridae and superficially resembled crinoids in the possession of long stalks attached to the seabed, attain their maximum development at this time.\n\n<center>\n<gallery>\nImage:Aviculopecten subcardiformis01.JPG|''Aviculopecten subcardiformis''; a [[bivalve]] from the [[Logan Formation]] (Lower Carboniferous) of [[Wooster, Ohio]] (external mold).\nImage:LoganFauna011312.jpg|Bivalves (''Aviculopecten'') and brachiopods (''Syringothyris'') in the Logan Formation (Lower Carboniferous) in Wooster, Ohio.\nImage:Syringothyris01.JPG|''Syringothyris'' sp.; a spiriferid [[brachiopod]] from the Logan Formation (Lower Carboniferous) of Wooster, Ohio (internal mold).\nImage:Palaeophycus01.JPG|''Palaeophycus'' ichnosp.; a [[trace fossil]] from the Logan Formation (Lower Carboniferous) of Wooster, Ohio.\nImage:PlatyceratidMississippian.JPG|[[Crinoid]] calyx from the Lower Carboniferous of Ohio with a conical [[Platyceratidae|platyceratid]] gastropod (''Palaeocapulus acutirostre'') attached.\nImage:Conulariid03.jpg|Conulariid from the Lower Carboniferous of Indiana.\nImage:Syringoporid.jpg|Tabulate coral (a syringoporid); Boone Limestone (Lower Carboniferous) near Hiwasse, Arkansas.\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n===Freshwater and lagoonal invertebrates===\nFreshwater Carboniferous invertebrates include various [[bivalve]] [[mollusc]]s that lived in brackish or fresh water, such as ''[[Anthraconaia]]'', ''[[Naiadites]]'', and ''[[Carbonicola]]''; diverse [[crustacean]]s such as ''[[Candona]]'', ''[[Carbonita (genus)|Carbonita]]'', ''[[Darwinula]]'', ''[[Estheria (crustacean)|Estheria]]'', ''[[Acanthocaris]]'', ''[[Dithyrocaris]]'', and ''[[Anthrapalaemon]]''.\n\n[[File:Megarachne BW.jpg|thumb|The upper Carboniferous giant spider-like eurypterid ''[[Megarachne]]'' grew to legspans of {{convert|50|cm|0|abbr=on}}.]]\nThe [[eurypterid]]s were also diverse, and are represented by such genera as ''[[Adelophthalmus]]'', ''[[Megarachne]]'' (originally misinterpreted as a giant spider, hence its name) and the specialised very large ''[[Hibbertopterus]]''. Many of these were amphibious.\n\nFrequently a temporary return of marine conditions resulted in marine or brackish water genera such as ''[[Lingula (genus)|Lingula]]'', [[Orbiculoidea]], and ''[[Productus]]'' being found in the thin beds known as marine bands.\n\n===Terrestrial invertebrates===\nFossil remains of air-breathing [[insect]]s,{{sfn|Garwood|Sutton|2010}} [[myriapod]]s and [[arachnid]]s{{sfn| Garwood |Dunlop |Sutton |2009}} are known from the late Carboniferous, but so far not from the early Carboniferous.{{sfn| Garwood |Edgecombe |2011}} The first true [[priapulid]]s appeared during this period. Their diversity when they do appear, however, shows that these arthropods were both well developed and numerous. Their large size can be attributed to the moistness of the environment (mostly swampy fern forests) and the fact that the oxygen concentration in the Earth's atmosphere in the Carboniferous was much higher than today.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Can Oxygen Set Thermal Limits in an Insect and Drive Gigantism? |last1=Verberk |first1=Wilco C.E.P. |last2=Bilton |first2=David T. |date=July 27, 2011 |journal=PLOS One |volume=6 |issue=7 |pages = e22610|df= |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0022610|pmid = 21818347|pmc=3144910 |bibcode=2011PLoSO...622610V }}</ref> This required less effort for respiration and allowed [[Arthropoda|arthropods]] to grow larger with the up to {{convert|2.6|m|ft|sp=us|adj=mid|-long}} millipede-like ''[[Arthropleura]]'' being the largest-known land invertebrate of all time.

Some British coalfields have yielded good specimens: ''[[Archaeoptitus]]'', from the Derbyshire coalfield, had a spread of wing extending to more than {{convert|35|cm|0|abbr=on}}; some specimens (''[[Brodia]]'') still exhibit traces of brilliant wing colors.

These included some, like ''[[Psammodus]]'', with crushing pavement-like teeth adapted for grinding the shells of brachiopods, crustaceans, and other marine organisms. Other sharks had piercing teeth, such as the [[Symmoriida]]; some, the [[petalodont]]s, had peculiar cycloid cutting teeth. Most of the sharks were marine, but the [[Xenacanthida]] invaded fresh waters of the coal swamps. Among the [[Osteichthyes|bony fish]], the [[Palaeonisciformes]] found in coastal waters also appear to have migrated to rivers. [[Sarcopterygii|Sarcopterygia]]n fish were also prominent, and one group, the [[Rhizodont]]s, reached very large size.\n\nMost species of Carboniferous marine fish have been described largely from teeth, fin spines and dermal ossicles, with smaller freshwater fish preserved whole.\n\nFreshwater fish were abundant, and include the genera ''[[Ctenodus]]'', ''[[Uronemus]]'', ''[[Acanthodes]]'', ''[[Cheirodus]]'', and ''[[Gyracanthus]]''.\n\n[[Shark]]s (especially the ''Stethacanthids'') underwent a major [[evolutionary radiation]] during the Carboniferous.<ref name=goldsharks/> It is believed that this evolutionary radiation occurred because the decline of the [[Placodermi|placoderms]] at the end of the Devonian period caused many [[Niche (ecology)|environmental niches]] to become unoccupied and allowed new organisms to evolve and fill these niches.<ref name=goldsharks/> As a result of the evolutionary radiation Carboniferous sharks assumed a wide variety of bizarre shapes including ''[[Stethacanthus]]'' which possessed a flat brush-like dorsal fin with a patch of [[Dermal denticle|denticles]] on its top.<ref name=goldsharks/> ''[[Stethacanthus]]''{{'s}} unusual fin may have been used in mating rituals.<ref name=goldsharks>{{cite web |url=http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/evolution/golden_age.htm |title=A Golden Age of Sharks |accessdate=2008-06-23 |website=Biology of Sharks and Rays {{!}} ReefQuest Centre for Shark Research |first=R.

These had long bodies, a head covered with bony plates and generally weak or undeveloped limbs. The largest were over 2 meters long. They were accompanied by an assemblage of smaller amphibians included under the [[Lepospondyli]], often only about {{convert|15|cm|0|abbr=on}} long. Some Carboniferous amphibians were aquatic and lived in rivers (''[[Loxomma]]'', ''[[Eogyrinus]]'', ''[[Proterogyrinus]]''); others may have been semi-aquatic (''[[Ophiderpeton]]'', ''[[Amphibamus]]'', ''[[Hyloplesion]]'') or terrestrial (''[[Dendrerpeton]]'', ''[[Tuditanus]]'', ''[[Anthracosaurus]]'').\n\nThe [[Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse]] slowed the evolution of amphibians who could not survive as well in the cooler, drier conditions. Reptiles, however, prospered due to specific key adaptations.<ref name=\"SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse\"/> One of the greatest evolutionary innovations of the Carboniferous was the [[amniote]] egg, which allowed the laying of eggs in a dry environment, allowing for the further exploitation of the land by certain [[tetrapod]]s. These included the earliest [[Sauropsida|sauropsid]] reptiles (''[[Hylonomus]]''), and the earliest known [[synapsid]] (''[[Archaeothyris]]''). These small lizard-like animals quickly gave rise to many descendants, [[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s, and [[mammal]]s.\n\nReptiles underwent a major evolutionary radiation in response to the drier climate that preceded the rainforest collapse.<ref name=\"SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse\"/><ref name=Kazlev>{{cite web |first=M.

Missouri State Senator [[Wayman Crow]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister [[William Greenleaf Eliot]], grandfather of the poet [[T.S. Eliot]], led the effort.\n\nThe university's first chancellor was [[Joseph Gibson Hoyt]]. Crow secured the university charter from the [[Missouri General Assembly]] in 1853, and Eliot was named President of the Board of Trustees. Early on, Eliot solicited support from members of the local business community, including [[John O'Fallon]], but Eliot failed to secure a permanent endowment. Washington University is unusual among major American universities in not having had a prior financial endowment. The institution had no backing of a religious organization, single wealthy patron, or earmarked government support.\n[[File:WGEliot.jpg|100px|left|thumb|William Greenleaf Eliot, first president of the Board of Trustees]]\n\nDuring the three years following its inception, the university bore three different names. The board first approved \"Eliot Seminary,\" but William Eliot was uncomfortable with naming a university after himself and objected to the establishment of a seminary, which would implicitly be charged with teaching a religious faith. He favored a nonsectarian university.<ref name=founding>{{cite web |url=http://magazine.wustl.edu/Summer03/FoundingOfWashU.html |title=The Founding of Washington University |accessdate=January 8, 2009 |work=Washington University in St. Louis Magazine |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725130512/http://magazine.wustl.edu/Summer03/FoundingOfWashU.html |archivedate=July 25, 2008 }}</ref> In 1854, the Board of Trustees changed the name to \"Washington Institute\" in honor of [[George Washington]], and because the charter was coincidentally passed on Washington\u2019s birthday, February 22.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://libguides.wustl.edu/wustl-faq/washington|title=Research Guides: WU History FAQ: Origin of Washington University's Name|last=Rectenwald|first=Miranda|website=libguides.wustl.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> Naming the university after the nation's first president, only seven years before the [[American Civil War]] and during a time of bitter national division, was no coincidence. During this time of conflict, Americans universally admired George Washington as the father of the United States and a symbol of national unity. The Board of Trustees believed that the university should be a force of unity in a strongly divided Missouri. In 1856, the university amended its name to \"Washington University.\" The university amended its name once more in 1976, when the Board of Trustees voted to add the suffix \"in St. Louis\" to distinguish the university from the over two dozen other universities bearing Washington's name.<ref name=\"george\" />[[File:Robert S. Brookings.jpg|right|100px|thumb|Robert S. Brookings]]\n\nAlthough chartered as a university, for many years Washington University functioned primarily as a night school located on 17th Street and Washington Avenue in the heart of downtown St. Louis. Owing to limited financial resources, Washington University initially used public buildings. Classes began on October 22, 1854, at the Benton School building. At first the university paid for the evening classes, but as their popularity grew, their funding was transferred to the [[St. Louis Public Schools]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3464:12:4.lincoln | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210162946/http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3464:12:4.lincoln | url-status=dead | archive-date=February 10, 2009 | title=Washington University | accessdate=January 8, 2009 | work=Northern Illinois University Libraries Digitization Projects }}</ref> Eventually the board secured funds for the construction of Academic Hall and a half dozen other buildings. Later the university divided into three departments: the Manual Training School, Smith Academy, and the [[Mary Institute]].\n\nIn 1867, the university opened the first private nonsectarian [[Washington University School of Law|law school]] west of the [[Mississippi River]]. By 1882, Washington University had expanded to numerous departments, which were housed in various buildings across St. Louis. Medical classes were first held at Washington University in 1891 after the St. Louis Medical College decided to affiliate with the university, establishing the [[Washington University School of Medicine|School of Medicine]]. During the 1890s, [[Robert S. Brookings|Robert Sommers Brookings]], the president of the Board of Trustees, undertook the tasks of reorganizing the university's finances, putting them onto a sound foundation, and buying land for a new campus.\n\nIn 1896, Holmes Smith, professor of Drawing and History of Art, designed what would become the basis for the modern day university seal. The seal is made up of elements from the Washington family coat of arms, and the symbol of [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]], whom the city is named after.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wustl.edu/about/history-traditions/|title=History and Traditions|website=Washington University in St. Louis|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\n===Modern era (1900\u20131955)===\n[[File:WUFranGat.JPG|right|thumb|150px|The Washington University crest at the entrance to [[Francis Field (St. Louis)|Francis Field]]]]\nWashington University spent its first half century in downtown St. Louis bounded by Washington Ave., Lucas Place, and Locust Street. By the 1890s, owing to the dramatic expansion of the Manual School and a new benefactor in Robert Brookings, the university began to move west. The university board of directors began a process to find suitable ground and hired the landscape architecture firm [[Olmsted Brothers|Olmsted, Olmsted & Eliot]] of Boston. A committee of Robert S. Brookings, [[Henry Ware Eliot]], and William Huse found a site of {{convert|103|acre|ha|1}} just beyond [[Forest Park (St. Louis)|Forest Park]], located west of the city limits in [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]]. The elevation of the land was thought to resemble the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] and inspired the nickname of \"Hilltop\" campus, renamed the Danforth campus in 2006 to honor former chancellor [[William Henry Danforth|William H. Danforth]].[[File:1904 World's Fair Administration Building (Brookings Hall, Washington University) seen from the southeast with the Italian Pavilion in the foreground.jpg|left|thumb|[[Brookings Hall]] during the [[1904 World\u2019s Fair|1904 World's Fair]]]]In 1899, the university opened a national design contest for the new campus.

The construction of [[Brookings Hall]], Ridgley, and Cupples began shortly thereafter. The school delayed occupying these buildings until 1905 to accommodate the [[1904 World's Fair]] and [[1904 Summer Olympics|Olympics]]. The delay allowed the university to construct ten buildings instead of the seven originally planned.

Missouri State Senator [[Wayman Crow]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister [[William Greenleaf Eliot]], grandfather of the poet [[T.S. Eliot]], led the effort.\n\nThe university's first chancellor was [[Joseph Gibson Hoyt]]. Crow secured the university charter from the [[Missouri General Assembly]] in 1853, and Eliot was named President of the Board of Trustees. Early on, Eliot solicited support from members of the local business community, including [[John O'Fallon]], but Eliot failed to secure a permanent endowment. Washington University is unusual among major American universities in not having had a prior financial endowment. The institution had no backing of a religious organization, single wealthy patron, or earmarked government support.\n[[File:WGEliot.jpg|100px|left|thumb|William Greenleaf Eliot, first president of the Board of Trustees]]\n\nDuring the three years following its inception, the university bore three different names. The board first approved \"Eliot Seminary,\" but William Eliot was uncomfortable with naming a university after himself and objected to the establishment of a seminary, which would implicitly be charged with teaching a religious faith. He favored a nonsectarian university.<ref name=founding>{{cite web |url=http://magazine.wustl.edu/Summer03/FoundingOfWashU.html |title=The Founding of Washington University |accessdate=January 8, 2009 |work=Washington University in St. Louis Magazine |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725130512/http://magazine.wustl.edu/Summer03/FoundingOfWashU.html |archivedate=July 25, 2008 }}</ref> In 1854, the Board of Trustees changed the name to \"Washington Institute\" in honor of [[George Washington]], and because the charter was coincidentally passed on Washington\u2019s birthday, February 22.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://libguides.wustl.edu/wustl-faq/washington|title=Research Guides: WU History FAQ: Origin of Washington University's Name|last=Rectenwald|first=Miranda|website=libguides.wustl.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> Naming the University after the nation's first president, only seven years before the [[American Civil War]] and during a time of bitter national division, was no coincidence. During this time of conflict, Americans universally admired George Washington as the father of the United States and a symbol of national unity. The Board of Trustees believed that the university should be a force of unity in a strongly divided Missouri. In 1856, the University amended its name to \"Washington University.\" The university amended its name once more in 1976, when the Board of Trustees voted to add the suffix \"in St. Louis\" to distinguish the university from the over two dozen other universities bearing Washington's name.<ref name=\"george\" />[[File:Robert S.

Owing to limited financial resources, Washington University initially used public buildings. Classes began on October 22, 1854, at the Benton School building. At first the university paid for the evening classes, but as their popularity grew, their funding was transferred to the [[St. Louis Public Schools]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3464:12:4.lincoln | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210162946/http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3464:12:4.lincoln | url-status=dead | archive-date=February 10, 2009 | title=Washington University | accessdate=January 8, 2009 | work=Northern Illinois University Libraries Digitization Projects }}</ref> Eventually the board secured funds for the construction of Academic Hall and a half dozen other buildings. Later the university divided into three departments: the Manual Training School, Smith Academy, and the [[Mary Institute]].\n\nIn 1867, the university opened the first private nonsectarian [[Washington University School of Law|law school]] west of the [[Mississippi River]]. By 1882, Washington University had expanded to numerous departments, which were housed in various buildings across St. Louis. Medical classes were first held at Washington University in 1891 after the St. Louis Medical College decided to affiliate with the University, establishing the [[Washington University School of Medicine|School of Medicine]]. During the 1890s, [[Robert S. Brookings|Robert Sommers Brookings]], the president of the Board of Trustees, undertook the tasks of reorganizing the university's finances, putting them onto a sound foundation, and buying land for a new campus.\n\nIn 1896, Holmes Smith, professor of Drawing and History of Art, designed what would become the basis for the modern day university seal. The seal is made up of elements from the Washington family coat of arms, and the symbol of [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]], whom the city is named after.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wustl.edu/about/history-traditions/|title=History and Traditions|website=Washington University in St. Louis|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\n===Modern era (1900\u20131955)===\n[[File:WUFranGat.JPG|right|thumb|150px|The Washington University crest at the entrance to [[Francis Field (St. Louis)|Francis Field]]]]\nWashington University spent its first half century in downtown St. Louis bounded by Washington Ave., Lucas Place, and Locust Street. By the 1890s, owing to the dramatic expansion of the Manual School and a new benefactor in Robert Brookings, the University began to move west. The University board of directors began a process to find suitable ground and hired the landscape architecture firm [[Olmsted Brothers|Olmsted, Olmsted & Eliot]] of Boston. A committee of Robert S. Brookings, [[Henry Ware Eliot]], and William Huse found a site of {{convert|103|acre|ha|1}} just beyond [[Forest Park (St. Louis)|Forest Park]], located west of the city limits in [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]]. The elevation of the land was thought to resemble the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] and inspired the nickname of \"Hilltop\" campus, renamed the Danforth campus in 2006 to honor former chancellor [[William Henry Danforth|William H.

The construction of [[Brookings Hall]], Ridgley, and Cupples began shortly thereafter. The school delayed occupying these buildings until 1905 to accommodate the [[1904 World's Fair]] and [[1904 Summer Olympics|Olympics]]. The delay allowed the university to construct ten buildings instead of the seven originally planned. This original cluster of buildings set a precedent for the development of the Danforth Campus; Cope & Stewardson's original plan and its choice of building materials have, with few exceptions, guided the construction and expansion of the Danforth Campus to the present day.<ref name=\"Architecture of Danforth Campus\" />\nBy 1915, construction of a new medical complex was completed on Kingshighway in what is now St. Louis's Central West End.

The [[ballpark]] is located adjacent to [[Nauset Regional Middle School]] along [[Massachusetts Route 28]]. It features the deepest centerfield in the Cape League at 434 feet, a [[bandstand]] just beyond the right-centerfield fence, and a playground beyond the left-centerfield fence. Fans on blankets and beach chairs take in the action from the grassy terraced hillside that runs the entire length of the first base side of the field. \n\n==History==\n\nThe oldest park in the Cape League, Eldredge Park opened in 1913, just one year after [[Fenway Park]]. The land for the park was donated to the town of Orleans by baseball enthusiast Louis Winslow \"Win\" Eldredge, \u201cin consideration of [his] affection for and interest in the young people of Orleans and [his] desire to provide a playground for them.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1P54d25uWESTEVhVG4zeURSRzg/view |title=Eldredge Park: Home of the Firebirds |publisher=orleansfirebirds.com |date= |accessdate=July 29, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://samsscrapbook.com/the-origin-of-eldredge-park/ |title=The Origin of Eldredge Park |publisher=samsscrapbook.com |date= |accessdate=July 29, 2019}}</ref> The park quickly became a popular community gathering place. Thanks to the nearby [[transatlantic telegraph cable]] station, fans at Eldredge were among the first Americans to receive the news that [[Charles Lindbergh]] had touched down safely in [[Paris]].<ref>Price, Christopher. ''Baseball by the Beach'', Hyannis, MA: Parnassus, 1998. p.201</ref>\n\nThe original configuration of Eldredge Park located home plate in what is today its left-field corner. After generations of [[Batting (baseball)|batters]] struggled to hit against the visual backdrop of a setting sun, the configuration was changed in the mid-1960s. The newly-reconfigured park opened for the 1967 CCBL all-star game,<ref>{{cite news | last = | first = | title = Work on Eldredge Park Field is Moving Ahead | pages = 19 | newspaper = The Cape Codder | location = Orleans, MA | date = June 29, 1967 | url = https://snow-library.com/viewer/2442/?return=1&css-name=include#page=19&viewer=picture&o=&n=0&q= }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = | first = | title = New Eldredge Park Ball Field Ready For All-Star Game Sun. | pages = 19 | newspaper = The Cape Codder | location = Orleans, MA | date = July 20, 1967 | url = https://snow-library.com/viewer/2453/?return=1&css-name=include#page=19&viewer=picture&o=&n=0&q= }}</ref> a game attended by [[Massachusetts]] [[Governor]] [[John Volpe]], who lauded Eldredge as the \"finest\" community field in [[New England]].<ref name=Art193>{{cite web|author= |url=http://capecodbaseball.org/news/asgnews/index.html?article_id=193 |title=Cape Cod Baseball League All-Star Game A look back at the past forty years |publisher=capecodbaseball.org |date= |accessdate=August 14, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = | first = | title = Lower Cape All-Stars Christen New Field With a 9-1 Victory | pages = 19 | newspaper = The Cape Codder | location = Orleans, MA | date = July 27, 1967 | url = https://snow-library.com/viewer/2454?medianame=1967_thecapecodder_vol22_issue21_orleans_000019 }}</ref>\n\nAdditional improvements continued to be made to Eldredge, as when lights were added in 1979.

V. 19]; Lev. xx. 15); [[blasphemy]] (Lev. xxiv. 16); [[false evidence]] in capital cases (Deut. xix. 16-19); [[false prophecy]] (Deut. xiii. 6, xviii. 20); [[idolatry]], actual or virtual (Lev. xx. 2; Deut. xiii. 7-19, xvii. 2-7); [[incest]]uous or unnatural connections (Lev. xviii. 22, xx. 11-14); [[insubordination]] to supreme authority (Deut. xvii. 12); [[kidnapping]] (Ex. xxi. 16; Deut. xxiv. 7); licentiousness of a priest's daughter (Lev. xxi. 9); [[murder]] (Ex. xxi. 12; Lev. xxiv. 17; Num. xxxv. 16 et seq.); [[rape]] committed on a betrothed woman (Deut. xxii. 25); striking or cursing a parent, or otherwise rebelling against parental authority (Ex. xxi. 15, 17; Lev. xx. 9; Deut. xxi. 18-21); [[Sabbath-breaking]] (Ex. xxxi. 14, xxxv. 2; Num. xv. 32-36); [[witchcraft]] and [[augury]] (Ex. xxii. 17; Lev. xx. 27).<ref name=JE1906>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Capital punishment|author=Marcus Jastrow, S.

Blasphemy, idolatry, Sabbath-breaking, witchcraft, [[prostitution]] by a betrothed virgin, or deceiving her husband at marriage as to her chastity (Deut. xxii. 21), and the rebellious son are, according to the Pentateuchal laws, to be punished with death by [[stoning]]; [[Bigamy|bigamous marriage]] with a wife's mother and the prostitution of a priest's daughter are punished by burning; communal [[apostasy]] is punished by the sword. With reference to all other capital offenses, the law ordains that the perpetrator shall die a violent death, occasionally adding the expression, \"His (their) blood shall be upon him (them).\" This expression, as we shall see presently, post-Biblical legislation applies to death by stoning. The Bible speaks also of hanging (Deut. xxi. 22), but, according to the rabbinical interpretation, not as a mode of execution, but, rather, of exposure after death (Sanh. vi. 4, 75b).<ref name=JE1906/>\n\n===In Rabbinic Judaism===\n\n[[File:Sanhedrin1.jpg|thumb|Illustration in 1883 encyclopaedia of the ancient Jewish [[Sanhedrin]] council]]\nThe harshness of the death penalty indicated the seriousness of the crime. Jewish philosophers argue that the whole point of corporal punishment was to serve as a reminder to the community of the severe nature of certain acts. This is why, in Jewish law, the death penalty is more of a principle than a practice. The numerous references to a death penalty in the [[Torah]] underscore the severity of the sin, rather than the expectation of death. This is bolstered by the standards of proof required for application of the death penalty, which has always been extremely stringent (Babylonian Talmud Makkoth 7b). The ''[[Mishnah]]'' (tractate Makkoth 1:10) outlines the views of several prominent first-century CE Rabbis on the subject:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"A Sanhedrin that puts a man to death once in seven years is called a murderous one. [[Eleazar ben Azariah|Rabbi Eliezer ben Azariah]] says, 'Or even once in 70 years.' [[Rabbi Tarfon]] and [[Rabbi Akiba]] said, 'If we had been in the Sanhedrin, no death sentence would ever have been passed'; [[Simeon ben Gamliel|Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel]] said: 'If so, they would have multiplied murderers in Israel.'\"<ref name=\"JVL-CapPun\">{{cite web|last1=Encyclopaedia Judaica|title=Capital Punishment|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0004_0_03929.html|publisher=The Gale Group|accessdate=9 August 2016}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe Sanhedrin stopped issuing capital punishment either after the Second Temple was destroyed, in 70 CE, or, alternatively, according to passages in the Talmud, in 30 CE, when the Sanhedrin were moved out of the [[Hall of Hewn Stones]]. Other sources, such as Josephus, disagree. The issue is highly debated because of the relevancy to the New Testament [[Sanhedrin trial of Jesus|trial of Jesus]].<ref name=\"Jewishvirtuallibrary.org Capital Punishment\">https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0004_0_03929.html</ref><ref name = \" dictionaryBible\">{{cite book |title= Mercer Dictionary of the Bible|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=goq0VWw9rGIC&pg=PA795&dq=sanhedrin+capital+punishment&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MSf0VP6OKPOasQT7gILwCg&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=sanhedrin%20capital%20punishment&f=false|editor= Watson E.

The idea of killing someone for a crime they commit is frowned upon in the Jewish tradition.\n\nIt was almost impossible to inflict the death penalty because the standards of proof were so high. As a result, convictions for capital offense were rare in Judaism.<ref>Mishnah Maccot, 1:10</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://lib.cet.ac.il/pages/item.asp?item=12862|title=\u8b9a\u8bac\u8c1e\u8bac \u8c1e\u9a7b\u7816\u8b9c\u8f6c|work=cet.ac.il}}</ref> The standards of evidence in capital cases include:\n*It requires two witnesses who observed the crime. The accused would have been given a chance, and if s/he repeated the same crime, or any other, it would lead to a death sentence. If witnesses had been caught lying about the crime, they would be executed.\n* Two witnesses were required. Acceptability was limited to:\n** Adult Jewish men who were known to keep the commandments, knew the written and oral law, and had legitimate professions;\n** The witnesses had to see each other at the time of the sin;\n** The witnesses had to be able to speak clearly, without any speech impediment or hearing deficit (to ensure that the warning and the response were done);\n** The witnesses could not be related to each other, or to the accused.\n* The witnesses had to see each other, and both of them had to give a warning (''hatra'ah'') to the person that the sin they were about to commit was a capital offense;\n* This warning had to be delivered within seconds of the performance of the sin (in the time it took to say, \"Peace unto you, my Rabbi and my Master\");\n* In the same amount of time, the person about to sin had to both respond that s/he was familiar with the punishment, but they were going to sin anyway; ''and'' begin to commit the sin/crime;\n* The Beth Din had to examine each witness separately; and if even one point of their evidence was contradictory - even if a very minor point, such as eye color - the evidence was considered contradictory, and the evidence was not heeded;\n* The Beth Din had to consist of minimally 23 judges;\n* The majority could not be a simple majority - the split verdict that would allow conviction had to be at least 13 to 11 in favor of conviction;\n* If the Beth Din arrived at a unanimous verdict of guilty, the person was let go - the idea being that if no judge could find anything exculpatory about the accused, there was something wrong with the court.<ref>Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Sanhedrin, page 17a.

The rules of evidence and other safeguards that the Torah provides to protect the accused made it all but impossible to actually invoke these penalties ... the system of judicial punishments could become brutal and barbaric unless administered in an atmosphere of the highest morality and piety. When these standards declined among the Jewish people, the Sanhedrin ... voluntarily abolished this system of penalties.<ref>[[Aryeh Kaplan|Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan]]. ''Handbook of Jewish Thought'', Volume II, pp. 170-71</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn the other hand, Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]], in a letter to then-New York Governor Hugh Carey,<ref>Responsa Iggerot Moshe, Choshen Mishpat v. 2 responsum 68</ref> states:\n\"One who murders because the prohibition to kill is meaningless to him, and he is especially cruel, and so too when murderers and evil people proliferate, they [the courts] would [should?] judge [capital punishment] to repair the issue [and] to prevent murder \u2013 for this [action of the court] saves the state.\"\n\n===Conservative Judaism===\n\nIn [[Conservative Judaism]], the death penalty was the subject of a [[responsa|responsum]] by its [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]], which has gone on record as opposing the modern institution of the death penalty: <blockquote>\"The Talmud ruled out the admissibility of circumstantial evidence in cases which involved a capital crime. Two witnesses were required to testify that they saw the action with their own eyes. A man could not be found guilty of a capital crime through his own confession or through the testimony of immediate members of his family. The rabbis demanded a condition of cool premeditation in the act of crime before they would sanction the death penalty; the specific test on which they insisted was that the criminal be warned prior to the crime, and that the criminal indicate by responding to the warning, that he is fully aware of his deed, but that he is determined to go through with it. In effect, this did away with the application of the death penalty. The rabbis were aware of this, and they declared openly that they found capital punishment repugnant to them\u2026 There is another reason which argues for the abolition of capital punishment. It is the fact of human fallibility. Too often, we learn of people who were convicted of crimes, and only later are new facts uncovered by which their innocence is established.

V. 19]; Lev. xx. 15); [[blasphemy]] (Lev. xxiv. 16); [[false evidence]] in capital cases (Deut. xix. 16-19); [[false prophecy]] (Deut. xiii. 6, xviii. 20); [[idolatry]], actual or virtual (Lev. xx. 2; Deut. xiii. 7-19, xvii. 2-7); [[incest]]uous or unnatural connections (Lev. xviii. 22, xx. 11-14); [[insubordination]] to supreme authority (Deut. xvii. 12); [[kidnapping]] (Ex. xxi. 16; Deut. xxiv. 7); licentiousness of a priest's daughter (Lev. xxi. 9); [[murder]] (Ex. xxi. 12; Lev. xxiv. 17; Num. xxxv. 16 et seq.); [[rape]] committed on a betrothed woman (Deut. xxii. 25); striking or cursing a parent, or otherwise rebelling against parental authority (Ex. xxi. 15, 17; Lev. xx. 9; Deut. xxi. 18-21); [[Sabbath-breaking]] (Ex. xxxi. 14, xxxv. 2; Num. xv. 32-36); [[witchcraft]] and [[augury]] (Ex. xxii. 17; Lev. xx. 27).<ref name=JE1906>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Capital punishment|author=Marcus Jastrow, S.

Blasphemy, idolatry, Sabbath-breaking, witchcraft, [[prostitution]] by a betrothed virgin, or deceiving her husband at marriage as to her chastity (Deut. xxii. 21), and the rebellious son are, according to the Pentateuchal laws, to be punished with death by [[stoning]]; [[Bigamy|bigamous marriage]] with a wife's mother and the prostitution of a priest's daughter are punished by burning; communal [[apostasy]] is punished by the sword. With reference to all other capital offenses, the law ordains that the perpetrator shall die a violent death, occasionally adding the expression, \"His (their) blood shall be upon him (them).\" This expression, as we shall see presently, post-Biblical legislation applies to death by stoning. The Bible speaks also of hanging (Deut. xxi. 22), but, according to the rabbinical interpretation, not as a mode of execution, but, rather, of exposure after death (Sanh. vi. 4, 75b).<ref name=JE1906/>\n\n===In Rabbinic Judaism===\n\n[[File:Sanhedrin1.jpg|thumb|Illustration in 1883 encyclopaedia of the ancient Jewish [[Sanhedrin]] council]]\nThe harshness of the death penalty indicated the seriousness of the crime. Jewish philosophers argue that the whole point of corporal punishment was to serve as a reminder to the community of the severe nature of certain acts. This is why, in Jewish law, the death penalty is more of a principle than a practice. The numerous references to a death penalty in the [[Torah]] underscore the severity of the sin, rather than the expectation of death. This is bolstered by the standards of proof required for application of the death penalty, which has always been extremely stringent (Babylonian Talmud Makkoth 7b). The ''[[Mishnah]]'' (tractate Makkoth 1:10) outlines the views of several prominent first-century CE Rabbis on the subject:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"A Sanhedrin that puts a man to death once in seven years is called a murderous one. [[Eleazar ben Azariah|Rabbi Eliezer ben Azariah]] says, 'Or even once in 70 years.' [[Rabbi Tarfon]] and [[Rabbi Akiba]] said, 'If we had been in the Sanhedrin, no death sentence would ever have been passed'; [[Simeon ben Gamliel|Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel]] said: 'If so, they would have multiplied murderers in Israel.'\"<ref name=\"JVL-CapPun\">{{cite web|last1=Encyclopaedia Judaica|title=Capital Punishment|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0004_0_03929.html|publisher=The Gale Group|accessdate=9 August 2016}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe Sanhedrin stopped issuing capital punishment either after the Second Temple was destroyed, in 70 CE, or, alternatively, according to passages in the Talmud, in 30 CE, when the Sanhedrin were moved out of the [[Hall of Hewn Stones]]. Other sources, such as Josephus, disagree. The issue is highly debated because of the relevancy to the New Testament [[Sanhedrin trial of Jesus|trial of Jesus]].<ref name=\"Jewishvirtuallibrary.org Capital Punishment\">https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0004_0_03929.html</ref><ref name = \" dictionaryBible\">{{cite book |title= Mercer Dictionary of the Bible|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=goq0VWw9rGIC&pg=PA795&dq=sanhedrin+capital+punishment&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MSf0VP6OKPOasQT7gILwCg&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=sanhedrin%20capital%20punishment&f=false| editors = Watson E.

Two witnesses were required to testify that they saw the action with their own eyes. A man could not be found guilty of a capital crime through his own confession or through the testimony of immediate members of his family. The rabbis demanded a condition of cool premeditation in the act of crime before they would sanction the death penalty; the specific test on which they insisted was that the criminal be warned prior to the crime, and that the criminal indicate by responding to the warning, that he is fully aware of his deed, but that he is determined to go through with it. In effect, this did away with the application of the death penalty. The rabbis were aware of this, and they declared openly that they found capital punishment repugnant to them\u2026 There is another reason which argues for the abolition of capital punishment. It is the fact of human fallibility. Too often, we learn of people who were convicted of crimes, and only later are new facts uncovered by which their innocence is established.
