He is a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] and served in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] from 1997 to 2007, representing [[Florida's 11th congressional district]]. He was the Democratic nominee for [[governor of Florida]] in the [[Florida gubernatorial election, 2006|2006 election]], but was defeated by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Charlie Crist]].\n\n==Early life and education==\n{{New Democrats}}\nDavis was born in [[Tampa, Florida]]. He graduated from [[Jesuit High School of Tampa]] in 1975, and attended [[Washington and Lee University]], where he received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] [[Academic degree|degree]] in 1979. He later attended the [[University of Florida|University of Florida's]] [[Levin College of Law|College of Law]], received his [[Juris Doctor]] in 1982. He later credited his grandfather as an important influence on his life.\n\n==Career==\nDavis worked as a lawyer in private practice from 1982 to 1988, when he became a partner in the Tampa-based business [[law firm]] of Bush, Ross, Gardner, Warren & Rudy. Davis was elected to the [[Florida House of Representatives]] in 1989 and served until 1996, serving as [[Majority leader|House Majority Leader]] from 1995 to 1996.\n\n==US House==\nDavis entered the race for the Tampa-based 11th District in 1996, after [[Sam Gibbons]]\u2014the district's only congressman since its creation in 1963\u2014announced his retirement.  Although Gibbons had endorsed Davis as his successor, Davis finished second in a four-way Democratic primary behind former Tampa mayor [[Sandra W. Freedman|Sandy Freedman]].  He won the runoff with 56 percent of the vote.\n \nHe faced Republican Mark Sharpe in the general election.  The race was initially thought to be close, especially since Sharpe had nearly defeated Gibbons in 1994 and held him to 52 percent in 1992.  However, Davis won by a convincing 15-point margin, largely due to [[Bill Clinton]] carrying the district.  After defeating an underfunded Republican in 1998, Davis faced only a Libertarian candidate in 2000 and 2004 and was completely unopposed in 2002.\n\nDavis was one of the co-chairs of the [[New Democrat Coalition]] in the House of Representatives. The New Democrat Coalition is affiliated with the centrist [[Democratic Leadership Council]].\n\nOn October 10, 2002, Jim Davis was among the 81 House Democrats who voted in favor of authorizing the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]].\n\n==2006 Gubernatorial Campaign==\n[[File:U.S. Representative and gubernatorial candidate Jim Davis speaking at a campaign rally in Wilton Manors.jpg|thumb|right|Davis campaigning in [[Wilton Manors, Florida|Wilton Manors]]]]\nDavis announced his candidacy for governor of Florida in 2005 and won the Democratic primary held on September 5, 2006. He defeated then-state Senator [[Rod Smith (politician)|Rod Smith]] by a margin of 46 percent to 42 percent.\n\nHe received the endorsements of former U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]], U.S. senator for Florida [[Bill Nelson]], U.S. senator for Illinois [[Barack Obama]], former Governor and U.S. Senator [[Bob Graham]], former Governor [[Buddy MacKay]], former First Lady Rhea Chiles (wife of [[Lawton Chiles]]), former Tallahassee mayor and [[Florida Democratic Party]] chairman [[Scott Maddox]], Miami-Dade Democratic Party chairman Jimmy Morales, and Representatives [[Alcee Hastings]], [[Robert Wexler]], [[Corrine Brown]], and [[Debbie Wasserman Schultz]].\n\nHe lost the race to Attorney General [[Charlie Crist]] by a margin of 52-45.\n\n==Post-political career==\n{{As of|2007}}, Davis is employed at [[Holland & Knight]] in Tampa.

Before this their self-designation was \"\u0421\u0440\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0431\u0430\u043b\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0440\u044b\" (''Srel balalary'') \u2013 literally \"Children of Israel\". The [[Crimean Tatars]] referred to them as ''zulufl\u0131 \u00e7ufutlar'' (\"Jews with [[pe'ot]]\") to distinguish them from the [[Karaite Judaism|Karaites]], who were called ''zulufs\u0131z \u00e7ufutlar'' (\"Jews without pe'ot\").\n\n==Language==\nThe Krymchaks speak a modified form of the [[Crimean Tatar language]], called the [[Krymchak language]]. It is the Jewish patois,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Krymchak Dictionary|last=Ianbay|first=Iala|publisher=Harrassowitz Verlag|year=2016|isbn=978-3-447-10541-5|location=Wiesbaden|pages=IX-XIV}}</ref> or ethnolect of Crimean Tatar, which is a Kypchak Turkic language. Krymchak is not a distinct language, but only one constituent of Crimean Tatar. Before the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917, the Krymchaks were at least bilingual: they spoke the Krymchak ethnolect and at the same time mostly used [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] for their religious life and for written communication. The Krymchaks adhered to their Turkic patois up to [[World War II]], but later began to lose their linguistic identity. Now they are making efforts to revive their language. Many of the linguistic characteristics of the Krymchak language could be found in the Crimean Tatar language. In addition, it contains numerous Hebrew and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] [[loan-words]] and was traditionally written in Hebrew characters (now it is written in [[Cyrillic script]]).\n\n==Origins==\nThe Krymchaks are likely a result of diverse origins whose ancestors probably included Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jews from the Byzantine empire, Genoa, Georgia, and other places.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Akiner|first=Shirin|title=Islamic peoples of the Soviet Union : with an appendix on the non-Muslim Turkic peoples of the Soviet Union : an historical and statistical handbook|publisher=KPI|year=1986|isbn=0-7103-0188-X|edition=2nd|location=London|pages=433}}</ref>\n\nOther more speculative theories include that the Krymchaks are probably partially descended from Jewish refugees who settled along the [[Black Sea]] in ancient times. Jewish communities existed in many of the [[Greek colonies]] in the region during the late classic period. Recently excavated inscriptions in Crimea have revealed a Jewish presence at least as early as the 1st century BCE. In some Crimean towns, monotheistic pagan cults called ''[[Hypsistarians|sebomenoi theon hypsiston]]'' (\"Worshippers of the All-Highest God,\" or \"[[God-Fearers]]\") existed.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} These quasi-proselytes kept the Jewish [[613 mitzvot|commandment]]s but remained uncircumcised and retained certain pagan customs. Eventually, these sects disappeared as their members adopted either [[Christianity]] or normative [[Judaism]]. Another theory is that after the suppression of [[Bar Kokhba's revolt]] by the emperor [[Hadrian]], those Jews who were not executed were exiled to the [[Crimean peninsula]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\nThe late classical era saw great upheaval in the region as Crimea was occupied by [[Goths]], [[Huns]], [[Bulgars]], [[Khazars]], and other peoples. Jewish merchants such as the [[Radhanites]] began to develop extensive contacts in the [[Black Sea|Pontic]] region during this period, and probably maintained close relations with the proto-Krymchak communities. Khazar dominance of Crimea during the [[Early Middle Ages]] is considered to have had at least a partial impact on Krymchak demographics.\n\n==Middle Ages==\n\nIn the late 7th century most of Crimea fell to the Khazars. The extent to which the Krymchaks influenced the ultimate conversion of the Khazars and the development of Khazar Judaism is unknown. During the period of Khazar rule, intermarriage between Crimean Jews and Khazars was likely, and the Krymchaks probably absorbed numerous Khazar refugees during the decline and fall of the Khazar kingdom (a Khazar [[successor state]], ruled by [[Georgius Tzul]], was centered in [[Kerch]]). It is known that [[Kipchak people|Kipchak]] converts to Judaism existed,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} and it is possible that from these converts the Krymchaks adopted their distinctive language.\n\nIn times when the Crimea belonged to the [[Byzantine Empire]] and after then, waves of [[History of the Jews in the Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Jews]] settled there. These newcomers were in most cases merchants from Constantinople and brought with them Romaniote Jewish practices (Bonfil 2011).\n\nThe [[Mongol]] conquerors of the [[Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe]] were promoters of religious freedom, and the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] occupation of southern Crimea (1315\u20131475) saw rising degrees of Jewish settlement in the region. The Jewish community was divided among those who prayed according to the [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]], Ashkenazi and [[Romaniotes|Romaniote]] rites. In 1515 the different traditions were united into a distinctive Krymchak prayer book, which represented the Romaniote rite<ref>Bernstein, S. \"S. K. Mirsky Memorial Volume\" pp. 451\u2013538. 1970</ref><ref>Glazer, S. M.

Before this their self-designation was \"\u0421\u0440\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0431\u0430\u043b\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0440\u044b\" (''Srel balalary'') \u2013 literally \"Children of Israel\".

It is the Jewish patois,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Krymchak Dictionary|last=Ianbay|first=Iala|publisher=Harrassowitz Verlag|year=2016|isbn=978-3-447-10541-5|location=Wiesbaden|pages=IX-XIV}}</ref> or ethnolect of Crimean Tatar, which is a Kypchak Turkic language. Krymchak is not a distinct language, but only one constituent of Crimean Tatar. Before the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917, the Krymchaks were at least bilingual: they spoke the Krymchak ethnolect and at the same time mostly used [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] for their religious life and for written communication. The Krymchaks adhered to their Turkic patois up to [[World War II]], but later began to lose their linguistic identity. Now they are making efforts to revive their language. Many of the linguistic characteristics of the Krymchak language could be found in the Crimean Tatar language. In addition, it contains numerous Hebrew and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] [[loan-words]] and was traditionally written in Hebrew characters (now it is written in [[Cyrillic script]]).\n\n==Origins==\nThe Krymchaks are likely a result of diverse origins whose ancestors probably included Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jews from the Byzantine empire, Genoa, Georgia, and other places.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Akiner|first=Shirin|title=Islamic peoples of the Soviet Union : with an appendix on the non-Muslim Turkic peoples of the Soviet Union : an historical and statistical handbook|publisher=KPI|year=1986|isbn=0-7103-0188-X|edition=2nd|location=London|pages=433}}</ref>\n\nOther more speculative theories include that the Krymchaks are probably partially descended from Jewish refugees who settled along the [[Black Sea]] in ancient times. Jewish communities existed in many of the [[Greek colonies]] in the region during the late classic period. Recently excavated inscriptions in Crimea have revealed a Jewish presence at least as early as the 1st century BCE. In some Crimean towns, monotheistic pagan cults called ''[[Hypsistarians|sebomenoi theon hypsiston]]'' (\"Worshippers of the All-Highest God,\" or \"[[God-Fearers]]\") existed.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} These quasi-proselytes kept the Jewish [[613 mitzvot|commandment]]s but remained uncircumcised and retained certain pagan customs. Eventually, these sects disappeared as their members adopted either [[Christianity]] or normative [[Judaism]]. Another theory is that after the suppression of [[Bar Kokhba's revolt]] by the emperor [[Hadrian]], those Jews who were not executed were exiled to the [[Crimean peninsula]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\nThe late classical era saw great upheaval in the region as Crimea was occupied by [[Goths]], [[Huns]], [[Bulgars]], [[Khazars]], and other peoples. Jewish merchants such as the [[Radhanites]] began to develop extensive contacts in the [[Black Sea|Pontic]] region during this period, and probably maintained close relations with the proto-Krymchak communities. Khazar dominance of Crimea during the [[Early Middle Ages]] is considered to have had at least a partial impact on Krymchak demographics.\n\n==Middle Ages==\n\nIn the late 7th century most of Crimea fell to the Khazars. The extent to which the Krymchaks influenced the ultimate conversion of the Khazars and the development of Khazar Judaism is unknown. During the period of Khazar rule, intermarriage between Crimean Jews and Khazars was likely, and the Krymchaks probably absorbed numerous Khazar refugees during the decline and fall of the Khazar kingdom (a Khazar [[successor state]], ruled by [[Georgius Tzul]], was centered in [[Kerch]]). It is known that [[Kipchak people|Kipchak]] converts to Judaism existed,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} and it is possible that from these converts the Krymchaks adopted their distinctive language.\n\nIn times when the Crimea belonged to the [[Byzantine Empire]] and after then, waves of [[History of the Jews in the Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Jews]] settled there. These newcomers were in most cases merchants from Constantinople and brought with them Romaniote Jewish practices (Bonfil 2011).\n\nThe [[Mongol]] conquerors of the [[Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe]] were promoters of religious freedom, and the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] occupation of southern Crimea (1315\u20131475) saw rising degrees of Jewish settlement in the region. The Jewish community was divided among those who prayed according to the [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]], Ashkenazi and [[Romaniotes|Romaniote]] rites. In 1515 the different traditions were united into a distinctive Krymchak prayer book, which represented the Romaniote rite<ref>Bernstein, S. \"S. K.
