At their ends, a divergence occurs as noted above.<ref name=Bx1-Bx2-Schedule/>\n\nUntil August 2008, when permanent traffic changes were enacted in Mott Haven at 149th Street, Melrose/Willis Avenues, and Third Avenue, the Bx2 turned east off of the Grand Concourse at 165th Street and ran down Melrose Avenue to 149th Street.\n\nAlong the way, connections to the [[New York City Subway]] can be made at:\n* [[Third Avenue\u2013138th Street (IRT Pelham Line)|Third Avenue\u2013138th Street]] ({{NYCS trains|Pelham}})\n* [[138th Street\u2013Grand Concourse (IRT Jerome Avenue Line)|138th Street\u2013Grand Concourse]] ({{NYCS trains|Jerome south}}; Bx1 only)\n* [[Third Avenue\u2013149th Street (IRT White Plains Road Line)|Third Avenue\u2013149th Street]] ({{NYCS trains|White Plains}}; Bx2 only)\n* [[149th Street\u2013Grand Concourse (New York City Subway)|149th Street\u2013Grand Concourse]] ({{NYCS trains|149th-Grand Concourse}})\n* [[161st Street\u2013Yankee Stadium (New York City Subway)|161st Street\u2013Yankee Stadium]] ({{NYCS trains|Yankee Stadium}})\n* [[Bedford Park Boulevard (IND Concourse Line)|Bedford Park Boulevard]] ({{NYCS trains|Concourse}})\n* [[Mosholu Parkway (IRT Jerome Avenue Line)|Mosholu Parkway]] ({{NYCS trains|Jerome}})\n* [[231st Street (IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line)|231st Street]] ({{NYCS trains|Broadway-Seventh north}}; Bx1 and some weekday southbound and Sunday-morning Bx2 buses)\n\nAs of September 2010, the Bx1 operates as a [[limited-stop]] service during the daytime on weekdays and Saturdays, while the Bx2 serves as the local.

SNHL accounts for about 90% of reported hearing loss. SNHL is not necessarily permanent and can be mild, moderate, severe, profound, or total. Various other descriptors can be used depending on the shape of the [[audiogram]], such as high frequency, low frequency, U-shaped, notched, peaked, or flat.\n\n''Sensory'' hearing loss often occurs as a consequence of damaged or deficient cochlear [[hair cell]]s.{{disputed inline|date=November 2015}} Hair cells may be abnormal at birth, or damaged during the lifetime of an individual. There are both external causes of damage, including [[Ear infection|infection]], and [[Ototoxicity|ototoxic]] drugs, as well as intrinsic causes, including [[genetic mutations]]. A common cause or exacerbating factor in SNHL is prolonged exposure to environmental noise, or [[noise-induced hearing loss]]. Exposure to a single very loud noise such as a gun shot or bomb blast can cause noise-induced hearing loss. Using headphones at high volume over time, or being in loud environments regularly, such as a loud workplace, sporting events, concerts, and using lawn equipment can also be a risk for noise-induced hearing loss.\n\n''Neural'', or \"retrocochlear\", hearing loss occurs because of damage to the [[cochlear nerve]] (CVIII). This damage may affect the initiation of the nerve impulse in the cochlear nerve or the transmission of the nerve impulse along the nerve into the [[brainstem]].\n\nMost cases of SNHL present with a gradual deterioration of hearing thresholds occurring over years to decades. In some, the loss may eventually affect large portions of the [[hearing range|frequency range]]. It may be accompanied by other symptoms such as ringing in the ears ([[tinnitus]]) and dizziness or lightheadedness ([[vertigo]]). The most common kind of sensorineural hearing loss is age-related ([[presbycusis]]), followed by [[noise-induced hearing loss]] (NIHL).\n\nFrequent symptoms of SNHL are loss of acuity in distinguishing foreground voices against noisy backgrounds, difficulty understanding on the telephone, some kinds of sounds seeming excessively loud or shrill, difficulty understanding some parts of speech ([[fricative]]s and [[sibilant]]s), loss of directionality of sound (especially with high frequency sounds), perception that people mumble when speaking, and difficulty understanding speech. Similar symptoms are also associated with other kinds of hearing loss; audiometry or other diagnostic tests are necessary to distinguish sensorineural hearing loss.\n\nIdentification of sensorineural hearing loss is usually made by performing a [[pure tone audiometry]] (an audiogram) in which bone conduction thresholds are measured. [[Tympanometry]] and [[Audiometry#Subjective audiometry|speech audiometry]] may be helpful. Testing is performed by an [[Audiology#Audiologist|audiologist]].\n\nThere is no proven or recommended treatment or cure for SNHL; management of hearing loss is usually by hearing strategies and hearing aids. In cases of profound or total deafness, a [[cochlear implant]] is a specialised hearing aid which may restore a functional level of hearing. SNHL is at least partially preventable by avoiding environmental noise, ototoxic chemicals and drugs, and head trauma, and treating or inoculating against certain triggering diseases and conditions like [[meningitis]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nSince the [[inner ear]] is not directly accessible to instruments, identification is by patient report of the symptoms and [[Audiometry|audiometric]] testing. Of those who present to their doctor with sensorineural hearing loss, 90% report having diminished hearing, 57% report having a plugged feeling in ear, and 49% report having ringing in ear ([[tinnitus]]). About half report vestibular (vertigo) problems.\n\nFor a detailed exposition of symptoms useful for screening, a self-assessment questionnaire was developed by the [[American Academy of Otolaryngology\u2013Head and Neck Surgery|American Academy of Otolaryngology]], called the Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults (HHIA). It is a 25-question survey of subjective symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Newman CW, Weinstein BE, Jacobson GP, Hug GA | title = Test-retest reliability of the hearing handicap inventory for adults | journal = Ear and Hearing | volume = 12 | issue = 5 | pages = 355\u20137 | date = October 1991 | pmid = 1783240 | doi = 10.1097/00003446-199110000-00009 }}</ref>\n\n==Causes==\nSensorineural hearing loss may be genetic or acquired (i.e. as a consequence of disease, noise, trauma, etc.). People may have a hearing loss from birth ([[congenital]]) or the hearing loss may come on later. Many cases are related to old age (age-related).\n\n===Genetic===\nHearing loss can be inherited.

Some may be [[Point mutation|single point mutations]], whereas others are due to [[chromosomal abnormalities]]. Some genetic causes give rise to a late onset hearing loss. Mitochondrial mutations can cause SNHL i.e. m.1555A>G, which makes the individual sensitive to the ototoxic effects of [[aminoglycoside antibiotics]].\n* The most common cause of recessive genetic congenital hearing impairment in developed countries is [[DFNB1]], also known as Connexin 26 deafness or [[GJB2]]-related deafness.\n* The most common syndromic forms of hearing impairment include (dominant) [[Stickler syndrome]] and [[Waardenburg syndrome]], and (recessive) [[Pendred syndrome]] and [[Usher syndrome]].\n* Mitochondrial mutations causing deafness are rare: [[MT-TL1]] mutations cause [[MIDD]] (Maternally inherited deafness and diabetes) and other conditions which may include deafness as part of the picture. \n* [[TMPRSS3]] gene was identified by its association with both congenital and childhood onset autosomal recessive deafness. This gene is expressed in fetal cochleae and many other tissues, and is thought to be involved in the development and maintenance of the [[inner ear]] or the contents of the [[perilymph]] and [[endolymph]].

It is a common viral infection contracted by contact with infected bodily fluids such as saliva or urine and easily transmitted in nurseries and thus from toddlers to expectant mothers.

One in three persons have significant hearing loss by age 65; by age 75, one in two. Age-related hearing loss is neither preventable nor reversible.\n\n====Noise====\n{{main|Noise-induced hearing loss}}\nMost people living in modern society suffer from some degree of progressive sensorineural (i.e. permanent) noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) resulting from overloading and damaging the sensory or neural apparatus of hearing in the inner ear. NIHL is typically a drop-out or notch centered at 4000&nbsp;Hz. Both intensity (SPL) and duration of exposure, and repetitive exposure to unsafe levels of noise contribute to cochlear damage that results in hearing loss. The louder the noise is, the shorter the safe amount of exposure is. NIHL can be either permanent or temporary, called a threshold shift. Unsafe levels of noise can be as little as 70&nbsp;dB (about twice as loud as normal conversation) if there is prolonged (24-hour) or continuous exposure. 125&nbsp;dB (a loud rock concert is ~120&nbsp;dB) is the pain level; sounds above this level cause instant and permanent ear damage.\n\nNoise and ageing are the primary causes of [[presbycusis]], or age-related hearing loss, the most common kind of hearing loss in industrial society.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gates GA, Mills JH | title = Presbycusis | journal = Lancet | volume = 366 | issue = 9491 | pages = 1111\u201320 | date = September 2005 | pmid = 16182900 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67423-5 | quote = Presbycusis (or presbyacusis) is a general term that refers to hearing loss in the elderly and, as such, represents the contributions of a lifetime of insults to the auditory system. Of these, ageing and noise damage are the chief factors, plus genetic susceptibility, otological disorders, and exposures to ototoxic agents. }}</ref>\n\n{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The dangers of environmental and occupational noise exposure are widely recognized. Numerous national and international organizations have established standards for safe levels of exposure to noise in industry, the environment, military, transportation, agriculture, mining and other areas.<ref group=\"Note\">A few prominent ones are American National Standards Institute (ANSI), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr Normung (DIN), Swedish Standards Institute (SSI), Canadian Standards Association (CSA), British Standards Institute (BSI), Austrian Standards Institute (\u00d6NORM), and in the United States, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and numerous state agencies, and Department of Defense (DOD) among others.</ref> Sound intensity or sound pressure level (SPL) is measured in decibels (dB). For reference:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!db Level\n!Example\n|-\n|45&nbsp;dB\n|Ambient noise level around the home\n|-\n|60&nbsp;dB\n|Quiet office\n|-\n|60\u201365&nbsp;dB\n|Normal conversation\n|-\n|70&nbsp;dB \n|City street noise at 25'{{Clarify|reason=|date=January 2018}} or average TV audio\n|-\n|80&nbsp;dB\n|Noisy office\n|-\n|95\u2013104&nbsp;dB\n|Nightclub dance floor\n|-\n|120&nbsp;dB\n|Close-by thunder or a loud rock concert\n|-\n|150\u2013160&nbsp;dB\n|Gunshot from a handheld gun\n|}\nAn increase of 6&nbsp;dB represents a doubling of the SPL, or energy of the sound wave, and therefore its propensity to cause ear damage. Because human ears hear logarithmically, not linearly, it takes an increase of 10&nbsp;dB to produce a sound that is perceived to be twice as loud. Ear damage due to noise is proportional to sound intensity, not perceived loudness, so it's misleading to rely on subjective perception of loudness as an indication of the risk to hearing, i.e. it can significantly underestimate the danger.\n\nWhile the standards differ moderately in levels of intensity and duration of exposure considered safe, some guidelines can be derived.<ref group=\"Note\">The various standards quantify nose exposure with a set of specified measures, usually with respect to a reference exposure time of 8 hours, a typical working day. The measures include, a weighting scale (usually A) with a sample time, a threshold value in dB, a criterion sound pressure level in dB with an exposure time usually in hours, and an exchange rate in dB. A weighted SPL is denoted dB(X) where X is a weighting scale, usually A, but sometimes C. (A) refers to [[A-weighting]] of SPL, which is an adjustment to measured SPL to compensate for the frequency response of the human ear, which is less sensitive to low frequencies. The criterion level is the average sound pressure level permitted over the exposure time. The threshold sound pressure level is the level above which sound will be integrated into the average. The sample time (fast, slow or impulse) is the rate of sampling&nbsp;\u2014 a slow sample time is 1 second; a fast sample time is 1/8 second, and impulse sample time is 35 milliseconds. The effect of a slower sample time means that very short duration sounds may not be fully sampled (or even sampled at all in rare cases), so the noise exposure may be underestimated. The exchange rate is the amount by which the permitted sound level may increase if the exposure time is halved.</ref>\n\nThe safe amount of exposure is reduced by a factor of 2 for every exchange rate (3&nbsp;dB for NIOSH standard or 5&nbsp;dB for [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] standard) increase in SPL. For example, the safe daily exposure amount at 85&nbsp;dB (90&nbsp;dB for OSHA) is 8 hours, while the safe exposure at 94&nbsp;dB(A) (nightclub level) is only 1 hour. Noise trauma can also cause a reversible hearing loss, called a temporary threshold shift. This typically occurs in individuals who are exposed to gunfire or firecrackers, and hear ringing in their ears after the event ([[tinnitus]]).\n* '''Ambient environmental noise''': Populations living near airports, railyards and train stations, freeways and industrial areas are exposed to levels of noise typically in the 65 to 75 dBA range. If lifestyles include significant outdoor or open window conditions, these exposures over time can degrade hearing. [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|U.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development]] sets standards for noise impact in residential and commercial construction zones. HUD\u2019s noise standards may be found in 24 CFR Part 51, Subpart B. Environmental noise above 65&nbsp;dB defines a noise-impacted area.\n* '''Personal audio electronics''': Personal audio equipment such as [[Apple iPod|iPods]] (iPods often reach 115 decibels or higher), can produce powerful enough sound to cause significant NIHL.<ref name=\"def1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hearingconservation.org/docs/virtualPressRoom/portnuff.htm|title=Sound Output Levels of the iPod and Other MP3 Players: Is There Potential Risk to Hearing?|access-date=2007-11-20 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071030124816/http://www.hearingconservation.org/docs/virtualPressRoom/portnuff.htm |archive-date = October 30, 2007}}</ref>\n* '''Acoustic trauma:''' Exposure to a single event of extremely loud noise (such as explosions) can also cause temporary or permanent hearing loss. A typical source of acoustic trauma is a too-loud music concert.\n* '''Workplace noise:''' The OSHA standards 1910.95 General Industry Occupational Noise Exposure and 1926.52 Construction Industry Occupational Noise Exposure identify the level of 90&nbsp;dB(A) for 8 hour exposure as the level necessary to protect workers from hearing loss.\n\n====Disease or disorder====\n{{Prose|section|date=January 2018}}\n* [[inflammation|Inflammatory]]\n** Suppurative [[labyrinthitis]] or otitis interna (inflammation of the inner ear)\n* [[Diabetes mellitus]] {{main|Diabetes mellitus and deafness}} A recent study found that hearing loss is twice as common in people with diabetes as it is in those who don't have the disease. Also, of the 86 million adults in the U.S. who have prediabetes, the rate of hearing loss is 30 percent higher than in those with normal blood glucose. It has not been established how diabetes is related to hearing loss. It is possible that the high blood glucose levels associated with diabetes cause damage to the small blood vessels in the inner ear, similar to the way in which diabetes can damage the eyes and the kidneys. Similar studies have shown a possible link between that hearing loss and neuropathy (nerve damage).\n* [[Tumor]]\n** Cerebellopontine angle tumour (junction of the [[pons]] and [[cerebellum]]) \u2013 The cerebellopontine angle is the exit site of both the [[facial nerve]](CN7) and the [[vestibulocochlear nerve]](CN8). Patients with these tumors often have signs and symptoms corresponding to compression of both nerves.\n***[[Acoustic neuroma]] (vestibular schwannoma) \u2013 benign neoplasm of [[Schwann cell]]s affecting the vestibulocochlear nerve\n***[[Meningioma]] \u2013 benign tumour of the [[pia mater|pia]] and [[arachnoid mater]]\n* [[M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease]] \u2013 causes sensorineural hearing loss in the low frequency range (125&nbsp;Hz to 1000&nbsp;Hz). M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease is characterized by sudden attacks of vertigo, lasting minutes to hours preceded by [[tinnitus]], aural fullness, and fluctuating hearing loss. It is relatively rare and commonly over diagnosed.\n* Bacterial [[meningitis]] e.g. pneumococcal, meningococcal, haemophilus influenzae may damage the [[cochlea]] \u2013 Hearing loss is one of the most common after-effects of bacterial meningitis. It has been estimated that 30% of bacterial meningitis cases result in mild to profound hearing loss. Children are most at risk: seventy percent of all bacterial meningitis occurs in young children under the age of five.\n* Viral\n**[[AIDS]] and [[AIDS-related complex|ARC]] patients frequently experience auditory system anomalies.\n** [[Mumps]](epidemic parotitis) may result in profound sensorineural hearing loss (90 [[Decibel|dB]] or more), unilaterally (one ear) or bilaterally (both ears).\n** [[Measles]] may result in [[Vestibulocochlear nerve|auditory nerve]] damage but more commonly gives a mixed (sensorineural plus conductive) hearing loss, and can be bilaterally.\n** [[Ramsay Hunt syndrome type II]] (herpes zoster oticus)\n* Bacterial\n** [[Syphilis]] is commonly transmitted from pregnant women to their fetuses, and about a third of the infected children will eventually become deaf.\n\n====Ototoxic and neurotoxic drugs and chemicals====\n{{main|ototoxicity}}\nSome over-the-counter as well as prescription drugs and certain industrial chemicals are ototoxic. Exposure to these can result in temporary or permanent hearing loss.\n\nSome medications cause irreversible damage to the ear, and are limited in their use for this reason. The most important group is the [[aminoglycoside]]s (main member [[gentamicin]]). A rare mitochondrial mutation, m.1555A>G, can increase an individual's susceptibility to the ototoxic effect of aminoglycosides. Long term [[hydrocodone]] (Vicodin) abuse is known to cause rapidly progressing sensorineural hearing loss, usually without vestibular symptoms. [[Methotrexate]], a chemotherapy agent, is also known to cause hearing loss. In most cases hearing loss does not recover when the drug is stopped. Paradoxically, methotrexate is also used in the treatment of autoimmune-induced inflammatory hearing loss.\n\nVarious other medications may reversibly degrade hearing. This includes loop [[diuretic]]s, [[sildenafil]] (Viagra), high or sustained dosing of [[NSAID]]s ([[aspirin]], [[ibuprofen]], [[naproxen]], and various prescription drugs: [[celecoxib]], etc.), [[quinine]], and [[macrolide]] antibiotics ([[erythromycin]], etc.). Cytotoxic agents such as carboplatinum, used to treat malignancies can give rise to a dose dependent SNHL, as can drugs such as desferrioxamine, used for haematological disorders such as thalassaemia; patients prescribed these drugs need to have hearing monitored.\n\nProlonged or repeated environmental or work-related exposure to ototoxic chemicals can also result in sensorineural hearing loss. Some of these chemicals are:\n* [[butyl nitrite]] \u2013 chemical used recreationally known as '[[poppers]]'\n* [[carbon disulfide]] \u2013 a solvent used as a building block in many organic reactions\n* [[styrene]], an industrial chemical precursor of [[polystyrene]], a plastic\n* [[carbon monoxide]], a poisonous gas resulting from incomplete [[combustion]]\n* heavy metals: [[tin]], [[lead]], [[manganese]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]]\n* [[hexane]], an industrial solvent and one of the significant constituents of [[gasoline]]\n* [[ethylbenzene]], an industrial solvent used in the production of styrene\n* [[toluene]] and [[xylene]], highly poisonous petrochemical solvents. Toluene is a component of high-octane gasolne; xylene is used in the production of polyester fibers and resins.\n* [[trichloroethylene]], an industrial degreasing solvent\n* [[Organophosphate pesticide]]s\n\n====Head trauma====\nThere can be damage either to the ear itself or to the central auditory pathways that process the information conveyed by the ears. People who sustain head injury are susceptible to hearing loss or tinnitus, either temporary or permanent. Contact sports like football (U.S. NFL), hockey and cricket have a notable incidence of head injuries (concussions). In one survey of retired NFL players, all of whom reported one or more concussions during their playing careers, 25% had hearing loss and 50% had tinnitus.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n====Perinatal conditions====\nThese are much more common in premature babies, particularly those under 1500&nbsp;g at birth. [[Premature birth]] can be associated with problems that result in sensorineural hearing loss such as anoxia or hypoxia (poor oxygen levels), jaundice, intracranial haemorrhages, meningitis. [[Fetal alcohol syndrome]] is reported to cause hearing loss in up to 64% of infants born to [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] mothers, from the [[ototoxicity|ototoxic effect]] on the developing fetus, plus malnutrition during pregnancy from the excess [[ethanol|alcohol]] intake.\n\n====Iodine deficiency / Hypothyroidism====\n[[Iodine deficiency]] and endemic [[hypothyroidism]] are associated with hearing loss.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kochupillai N, Pandav CS, Godbole MM, Mehta M, Ahuja MM | title = Iodine deficiency and neonatal hypothyroidism | journal = Bulletin of the World Health Organization | volume = 64 | issue = 4 | pages = 547\u201351 | date = 1986 | pmid = 3490923 | pmc = 2490891 }}</ref> If a pregnant mother has insufficient iodine intake during pregnancy it affects the development of the inner ear in the foetus leading to sensorineural deafness. This occurs in certain areas of the world, such as the Himalayas, where iodine is deficient in the soil and thus the diet. In these areas there is a high incidence of endemic goitre. This cause of deafness is prevented by adding iodine to salt.\n\n====Brain stroke====\n[[Brain stroke]] in a region affecting auditory function such as a [[posterior circulation infarct]] has been associated with deafness.\n\n==Pathophysiology==\nSensory hearing loss is caused by abnormal structure or function of the [[hair cells]] of the [[organ of Corti]] in the [[cochlea]].{{disputed inline|date=November 2015}} Neural hearing impairments are consequent upon damage to the eighth [[cranial nerve]] (the [[vestibulocochlear nerve]]) or the auditory tracts of the [[brainstem]]. If higher levels of the auditory tract are affected this is known as [[central deafness]]. Central deafness may present as sensorineural deafness but should be distinguishable from the history and audiological testing.\n\n===Cochlear dead regions in sensory hearing loss===\n{{overly detailed|section|date=November 2015}}\nHearing impairment may be associated with damage to the hair cells in the cochlea. Sometimes there may be complete loss of function of inner hair cells (IHCs) over a certain region of the cochlea; this is called a \"dead region\". The region can be defined in terms of the range of characteristic frequencies (CFs) of the IHCs and/or neurons immediately adjacent to the dead region.\n\n====Cochlear hair cells====\n[[File:Cochlea-crosssection.png|left|thumb|280px|Figure 3: Cross-section of the cochlea.]]\n\nOuter [[hair cells]] (OHCs) contribute to the structure of the [[Organ of Corti]], which is situated between the [[basilar membrane]] and the [[tectorial membrane]] within the cochlea (See Figure 3). The tunnel of corti, which runs through the Organ of Corti, divides the OHCs and the inner hair cells (IHCs). OHCs are connected to the reticular laminar and the Deiters\u2019 cells. There are roughly twelve thousand OHCs in each human ear, and these are arranged in up to five rows. Each OHC has small tufts of 'hairs', or cilia, on their upper surface known as [[stereocilia]], and these are also arranged into rows which are graded in height. There are approximately 140 stereocilia on each OHC.<ref name=\"Gelfand\">Gelfand SA. Hearing: An Introduction to Psychological and Physiological Acoustics. 4th ed. New York: Marcel Dekker; 2004.</ref>\n\nThe fundamental role of the OHCs and the IHCs is to function as [[sensory receptors]]. The main function of the IHCs is to transmit sound information via [[afferent neurons]]. They do this by transducing mechanical movements or signals into neural activity. When stimulated, the stereocilia on the IHCs move, causing a flow of electric current to pass through the hair cells. This electric current creates [[action potentials]] within the connected afferent neurons.\n\nOHCs are different in that they actually contribute to the active mechanism of the cochlea. They do this by receiving mechanical signals or vibrations along the basilar membrane, and transducing them into electrochemical signals. The stereocilia found on OHCs are in contact with the tectorial membrane. Therefore, when the basilar membrane moves due to vibrations, the stereocilia bend. The direction in which they bend, dictates the firing rate of the auditory neurons connected to the OHCs.<ref name=\"Moore-Whurr\">Moore BCJ. Cochlear Hearing Loss. London: Whurr Publishers; 1998.</ref>\n\nThe bending of the stereocilia towards the [[basal body]] of the OHC causes excitation of the hair cell. Thus, an increase in firing rate of the auditory neurons connected to the hair cell occurs. On the other hand, the bending of the stereocilia away from the basal body of the OHC causes inhibition of the hair cell. Thus, a decrease in firing rate of the auditory neurons connected to the hair cell occurs. OHCs are unique in that they are able to contract and expand (electromotility). Therefore, in response to the electrical stimulations provided by the efferent nerve supply, they can alter in length, shape and stiffness. These changes influence the response of the basilar membrane to sound.<ref name=\"Gelfand\" /><ref name=\"Moore-Whurr\" /> It is therefore clear that the OHCs play a major role in the active processes of the cochlea.<ref name=\"Gelfand\" /> The main function of the active mechanism is to finely tune the basilar membrane, and provide it with a high sensitivity to quiet sounds. The active mechanism is dependent on the cochlea being in good physiological condition. However, the cochlea is very susceptible to damage.<ref name=\"Moore-Whurr\" />\n\n=====Hair cell damage=====\n\nSNHL is most commonly caused by damage to the OHCs and the IHCs.{{disputed inline|date=November 2015}}  There are two methods by which they might become damaged. Firstly, the entire hair cell might die. Secondly, the stereocilia might become distorted or destroyed. Damage to the cochlea can occur in several ways, for example by viral infection, exposure to ototoxic chemicals, and intense noise exposure. Damage to the OHCs results in either a less effective active mechanism, or it may not function at all. OHCs contribute to providing a high sensitivity to quiet sounds at a specific range of frequencies (approximately 2\u20134&nbsp;kHz). Thus, damage to the OHCs results in the reduction of sensitivity of the basilar membrane to weak sounds. Amplification to these sounds is therefore required, in order for the basilar membrane to respond efficiently. IHCs are less susceptible to damage in comparison to the OHCs. However, if they become damaged, this will result in an overall loss of sensitivity.<ref name=\"Moore-Whurr\" />\n\n===Neural tuning curves===\n\n====Frequency selectivity====\n[[File:Tuning curve.svg|thumb|Figure 4: Neural tuning curve for normal hearing.]]\n\nThe [[traveling wave]] along the basilar membrane peaks at different places along it, depending on whether the sound is low or high frequency. Due to the mass and [[stiffness]] of the basilar membrane, low frequency waves peak in the apex, while high frequency sounds peak in the basal end of the cochlea.<ref name=\"Gelfand\" /> Therefore, each position along the basilar membrane is finely tuned to a particular frequency. These specifically tuned frequencies are referred to as characteristic frequencies (CF).<ref name=\"Moore-Whurr\" />\n\nIf a sound entering the ear is displaced from the characteristic frequency, then the strength of response from the basilar membrane will progressively lessen. The fine tuning of the basilar membrane is created by the input of two separate mechanisms. The first mechanism being a linear passive mechanism, which is dependent on the mechanical structure of the basilar membrane and its surrounding structures. The second mechanism is a non-linear active mechanism, which is primarily dependent on the functioning of the OHCs, and also the general physiological condition of the cochlea itself. The base and apex of the basilar membrane differ in stiffness and width, which cause the basilar membrane to respond to varying frequencies differently along its length. The base of the basilar membrane is narrow and stiff, resulting in it responding best to high frequency sounds. The apex of the basilar membrane is wider and much less stiff in comparison to the base, causing it to respond best to low frequencies.<ref name=\"Moore-Whurr\" />\n\nThis selectivity to certain frequencies can be illustrated by neural tuning curves. These demonstrate the frequencies a fiber responds to, by showing threshold levels [[Decibel#Acoustics|(dB SPL)]] of [[auditory nerve]] fibers as a function of different frequencies. This demonstrates that auditory nerve fibers respond best, and hence have better thresholds at the fiber's characteristic frequency and frequencies immediately surrounding it. The basilar membrane is said to be \u2018sharply tuned\u2019 due to the sharp \u2018V\u2019 shaped curve, with its \u2018tip\u2019 centered at the auditory fibers characteristic frequency. This shape shows how few frequencies a fiber responds to. If it were a broader \u2018V\u2019 shape, it would be responding to more frequencies (See Figure 4).<ref name=\"Gelfand\" />\n\n====IHC vs OHC hearing loss====\n[[File:Tuning curve for OHC loss.jpg|left|frame|Figure 5: Neural tuning curve for OHC loss. Adapted from.<ref name=\"Moore-Whurr\" />]]\n[[File:Tuning curve of OHC front row loss and IHC loss.jpg|frame|Figure 6: Neural tuning curve for OHC front row loss and IHC loss. Adapted from.<ref name=\"Moore-Whurr\" />]]\n\nA normal neural tuning curve is characterised by a broadly tuned low frequency \u2018tail\u2019, with a finely tuned middle frequency \u2018tip\u2019. However, where there is partial or complete damage to the OHCs, but with unharmed IHCs, the resulting tuning curve would show the elimination of sensitivity at the quiet sounds. I.e. where the neural tuning curve would normally be most sensitive (at the \u2018tip\u2019) (See Figure 5).<ref name=\"Moore-Whurr\" />\n\nWhere both the OHCs and the IHCs are damaged, the resulting neural tuning curve would show the elimination of sensitivity at the \u2018tip'. However, due to IHC damage, the whole tuning curve becomes raised, giving a loss of sensitivity across all frequencies (See Figure 6). It is only necessary for the first row of OHCs to be damaged for the elimination of the finely tuned \u2018tip\u2019 to occur. This supports the idea that the incidence of OHC damage and thus a loss of sensitivity to quiet sounds, occurs more than IHC loss.<ref name=\"Moore-Whurr\" />\n\nWhen the IHCs or part of the basilar membrane are damaged or destroyed, so that they no longer function as transducers, the result is a \u2018dead region\u2019. Dead regions can be defined in terms of the characteristic frequencies of the IHC, related to the specific place along the basilar membrane where the dead region occurs. Assuming that there has been no shift in the characteristic frequencies relating to certain regions of the basilar membrane, due to the damage of OHCs. This often occurs with IHC damage. Dead regions can also be defined by the anatomical place of the non-functioning IHC (such as an \u201capical dead region\u201d), or by the characteristic frequencies of the IHC adjacent to the dead region.<ref name=\"pmid15064655\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Moore BC | title = Dead regions in the cochlea: conceptual foundations, diagnosis, and clinical applications | journal = Ear and Hearing | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 98\u2013116 | date = April 2004 | pmid = 15064655 | doi = 10.1097/01.aud.0000120359.49711.d7 }}</ref>\n\n===Dead region audiometry===\n\n====Pure tone audiometry (PTA)====\n\nDead regions affect audiometric results, but perhaps not in the way expected. For example, it may be expected that thresholds would not be obtained at the frequencies within the dead region, but would be obtained at frequencies adjacent to the dead region. Therefore, assuming normal hearing exists around the dead region, it would produce an [[audiogram]] that has a dramatically steep slope between the frequency where a threshold is obtained, and the frequency where a threshold cannot be obtained due to the dead region.<ref name=\"pmid15064655\" />\n\n[[File:Basilar membrane 1.jpg|left|thumb|350px|Figure 7: Response of the basilar membrane to a pure tone.]]\n\n[[File:Basilar membrane 2B.jpg|left|thumb|350px|Figure 8: Response of the basilar membrane to a pure tone, when there is a dead region.]]\n\nHowever, it appears that this is not the case. Dead regions cannot be clearly found via PTA [[audiogram]]s. This may be because although the neurons innervating the dead region, cannot react to vibration at their characteristic frequency. If the basilar membrane vibration is large enough, neurons tuned to different characteristic frequencies such as those adjacent to the dead region, will be stimulated due to the spread of excitation. Therefore, a response from the patient at the test frequency will be obtained. This is referred to as \u201coff-place listening\u201d, and is also known as \u2018off-frequency listening\u2019. This will lead to a false threshold being found. Thus, it appears a person has better hearing than they actually do, resulting in a dead region being missed. Therefore, using PTA alone, it is impossible to identify the extent of a dead region (See Figure 7 and 8).<ref name=\"pmid15064655\" />\n\nConsequently, how much is an audiometric threshold affected by a tone with its frequency within a dead region? This depends on the location of the dead region. Thresholds at low frequency dead regions, are more inaccurate than those at higher frequency dead regions. This has been attributed to the fact that excitation due to vibration of the basilar membrane spreads upwards from the apical regions of the basilar membrane, more than excitation spreads downwards from higher frequency basal regions of the cochlea. This pattern of the spread of excitation is similar to the \u2018upward spread of masking\u2019 phenomenon. If the tone is sufficiently loud to produce enough excitation at the normally functioning area of the cochlea, so that it is above that areas threshold.

This means that the threshold of the responding area is sufficiently raised, so that it cannot detect the spread of excitation from the tone.

As the dead region will be less detectable due to the upward spread of excitation. Whereas, there may be a more obvious steeply sloping loss at high frequencies for a high frequency dead region. Although it is likely that the slope represents the less pronounced downward spread of excitation, rather than accurate thresholds for those frequencies with non-functioning hair cells. Mid-frequency dead regions, with a small range, appear to have less effect on the patient\u2019s ability to hear in everyday life, and may produce a notch in the PTA thresholds.<ref name=\"pmid15064655\" /> Although it is clear that PTA is not the best test to identify a dead region.<ref name=\"pmid16136791\" />\n\n====Psychoacoustic tuning curves (PTC) and threshold equalizing noise (TEN) tests====\n{{speculation|section|date=November 2015}}\n[[File:Psychoacoustical tuning curvesA.jpg|frame|Figure 9: Psychoacoustical tuning curve.]]\n\nAlthough some debate continues regarding the reliability of such tests,<ref name=\"pmid12677110\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Summers V, Molis MR, M\u00fcsch H, Walden BE, Surr RK, Cord MT | title = Identifying dead regions in the cochlea: psychophysical tuning curves and tone detection in threshold-equalizing noise | journal = Ear and Hearing | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 133\u201342 | date = April 2003 | pmid = 12677110 | doi = 10.1097/01.AUD.0000058148.27540.D9 }}</ref> it has been suggested {{weasel inline|date=November 2015}}that psychoacoustic tuning curves (PTCs) and threshold-equalising noise (TEN) results may be useful in detecting dead regions, rather than PTA. PTCs are similar to neural tuning curves. They illustrate the level of a masker (dB SPL) tone at threshold, as a function of deviation from center frequency (Hz).<ref name=\"Gelfand\" /> They are measured by presenting a fixed low intensity pure tone while also presenting a narrow-band masker, with a varying center frequency. The masker level is varied, so that the level of masker needed to just mask the test signal is found for the masker at each center frequency. The tip of the PTC is where the masker level needed to just mask the test signal is the lowest. For normal hearing people this is when the masker center frequency is closest to the frequency of the test signal (See Figure 9).<ref name=\"pmid16136791\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sek A, Alc\u00e1ntara J, Moore BC, Kluk K, Wicher A | title = Development of a fast method for determining psychophysical tuning curves | journal = International Journal of Audiology | volume = 44 | issue = 7 | pages = 408\u201320 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 16136791 | doi = 10.1080/14992020500060800 }}</ref>\n\nIn the case of dead regions, when the test signal lies within the boundaries of a dead region, the tip of the PTC will be shifted to the edge of the dead region, to the area that is still functioning and detecting the spread of excitation from the signal. In the case of a low frequency dead region, the tip is shifted upwards indicating a low frequency dead region starting at the tip of the curve. For a high frequency dead region, the tip is shifted downwards from the signal frequency to the functioning area below the dead region.<ref name=\"pmid16136791\" /> However, the traditional method of obtaining PTCs is not practical for clinical use, and it has been argued{{weasel inline|date=November 2015}} that TENs are not accurate enough.<ref name=\"pmid16136791\" /><ref name=\"pmid12677110\" /> A fast method for finding PTCs has been developed and it may provide the solution. However, more research to validate this method is required, before it can be accepted clinically.\n\n====Perceptual consequences of a dead region====\n\n[[Audiogram]] configurations are not good indicators of how a dead region will affect a person functionally, mainly due to individual differences.<ref name=\"Moore-Whurr\" /> For example, a sloping audiogram is often present with a dead region, due to the spread of excitation. However, the individual may well be affected differently from someone with a corresponding sloped audiogram caused by partial damage to hair cells rather than a dead region. They will perceive sounds differently, yet the audiogram suggests that they have the same degree of loss. Huss and Moore investigated how hearing impaired patients perceive pure tones, and found that they perceive tones as noisy and distorted, more (on average) than a person without a hearing impairment. However, they also found that the perception of tones as being like noise, was not directly related to frequencies within the dead regions, and was therefore not an indicator of a dead region. This therefore suggests that audiograms, and their poor representation of dead regions, are inaccurate predictors of a patient\u2019s perception of pure tone quality.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Huss M, Moore BC | title = Dead regions and noisiness of pure tones | journal = International Journal of Audiology | volume = 44 | issue = 10 | pages = 599\u2013611 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16315451 | doi = 10.1080/02640410500243962 }}</ref>\n\nResearch by Kluk and Moore  has shown that dead regions may also affect the patient\u2019s perception of frequencies beyond the dead regions. There is an enhancement in the ability to distinguish between tones that differ very slightly in frequency, in regions just beyond the dead regions compared to tones further away. An explanation for this may be that cortical re-mapping has occurred. Whereby, neurons which would normally be stimulated by the dead region, have been reassigned to respond to functioning areas near it. This leads to an over-representation of these areas, resulting in an increased perceptual sensitivity to small frequency differences in tones.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kluk K, Moore BC | title = Dead regions in the cochlea and enhancement of frequency discrimination: Effects of audiogram slope, unilateral versus bilateral loss, and hearing-aid use | journal = Hearing Research | volume = 222 | issue = 1\u20132 | pages = 1\u201315 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17071031 | doi = 10.1016/j.heares.2006.06.020 }}</ref>\n\n===Vestibulocochlear nerve pathology===\n* congenital deformity of the internal auditory canal,\n* neoplastic and pseudo-neoplastic lesions, with special detailed emphasis on schwannoma of the eighth cranial nerve (acoustic neuroma),\n* non-neoplastic Internal Auditory Canal/CerebelloPontine Angle pathology, including vascular loops,\n\n==Diagnosis==\n\n===Case history===\nBefore examination, a case history provides guidance about the context of the hearing loss.\n* major concern\n* pregnancy and childbirth information\n* medical history\n* development history\n* family history\n\n===Otoscopy===\nDirect examination of the external canal and tympanic membrane (ear drum) with an [[otoscope]], a medical device inserted into the ear canal that uses light to examine the condition of the external ear and tympanic membrane, and\nmiddle ear through the semi-translucent membrane.\n\n===Differential testing===\nDifferential testing is most useful when there is unilateral hearing loss, and distinguishes conductive from sensorineural loss.

Bone conduction thresholds can differentiate sensorineural hearing loss from conductive hearing loss. Other tests, such as oto-acoustic emissions, acoustic stapedial reflexes, speech audiometry and evoked response audiometry are needed to distinguish sensory, neural and auditory processing hearing impairments.\n\n===Tympanometry===\nA [[tympanogram]] is the result of a test with a tympanometer. It tests the function of the middle ear and mobility of the eardrum. It can help identify conductive hearing loss due to disease of the middle ear or eardrum from other kinds of hearing loss including SNHL.\n\n===Audiometry===\nAn [[audiogram]] is the result of a hearing test. The most common type of hearing test is [[pure tone audiometry]] (PTA). It charts the thresholds of hearing sensitivity at a selection of standard frequencies between 250 and 8000&nbsp;Hz. There is also high frequency pure tone audiometry which tests frequencies from 8000-20,000&nbsp;Hz. PTA can be used to differentiate between conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss and mixed hearing loss. A hearing loss can be described by its degree i.e. mild, moderate, severe or profound, or by its shape i.e. high frequency or sloping, low frequency or rising, notched, U-shaped or 'cookie-bite', peaked or flat.\n\nThere are also other kinds of audiometry designed to test hearing acuity rather than sensitivity (speech audiometry), or to test\nauditory neural pathway transmission (evoked response audiometry).\n\n===Magnetic resonance imaging===\nMRI scans can be used to identify gross structural causes of hearing loss. They are used for congenital hearing loss when changes to the shape of the inner ear or nerve of hearing may help diagnosis of the cause of the hearing loss. They are also useful in cases where a tumour is suspected or to determine the degree of damage in a hearing loss caused by bacterial infection or auto-immune disease. Scanning is of no value in age-related deafness.\n\n==Prevention==\nPresbycusis is the leading cause of SNHL and is progressive and nonpreventable, and at this time, we do not have either somatic or gene therapy to counter heredity-related SNHL. But other causes of acquired SNHL are largely preventable, especially nosocusis type causes. This would involve avoiding environmental noise, and traumatic noise such as rock concerts and nightclubs with loud music. Use of noise attenuation measures like [[Earplug|ear plugs]] is an alternative, as well as learning about the noise levels one is exposed to. Currently, several [https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2014/04/09/sound-apps/ accurate sound level measurement] apps exist.  [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/reducenoiseexposure/default.html Reducing exposure time] can also help manage risk from loud exposures.\n\n==Treatment==\nTreatment modalities fall into three categories: pharmacological, surgical, and management.

Nine out of ten people with SSHL lose hearing in only one ear. It should be considered a medical emergency. Delaying diagnosis and treatment may render treatment less effective or ineffective.\n\nExperts estimate that SSHL strikes one person per 100 every year, typically adults in their 40s and 50s. The actual number of new cases of SSHL each year could be much higher because the condition often goes undiagnosed.\n\n===Presentation===\nMany people notice that they have SSHL when they wake up in the morning. Others first notice it when they try to use the deafened ear, such as when they use a phone. Still others notice a loud, alarming \"pop\" just before their hearing disappears. People with sudden deafness often become dizzy, have ringing in their ears (tinnitus), or both.\n\n===Diagnosis===\nSSHL is diagnosed via pure tone audiometry. If the test shows a loss of at least 30&nbsp;dB in three adjacent frequencies, the hearing loss is diagnosed as SSHL. For example, a hearing loss of 30&nbsp;dB would make conversational speech sound more like a whisper.\n\n===Causes ===\nOnly 10 to 15 percent of the cases diagnosed as SSHL have an identifiable cause.

Osteoporosis, [[Stapedectomy|stapedectomy surgery]], pneumococcal vaccinations, mobile phone users, and [[hyperbilirubinemia]] at birth are among some of the known risk factors.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Conductive hearing loss]], hearing loss caused primarily by conditions in the middle ear\n* [[Cortical deafness]], another kind of nerve deafness\n* [[Hearing loss]]\n* [[Inner ear]], the innermost portion of the ear containing the sensorineural apparatus of hearing\n* [[Otosclerosis]], a sometimes associated or predecessor [[conductive hearing loss]] condition of the middle ear\n* [[Tinnitus]], ringing in the ears, a common accompaniment of SNHL\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n38.Ghazavi H,Kargoshaei A-A,Jamshidi-Koohsari M,\"Investigation of vitamin D levels in patients with Sudden Sensory-Neural Hearing Loss and its effect on treatment\",American journal of otolaryngology and head and neck medicine and suegery,November 2019\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjoto.2019.102327\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n| DiseasesDB = 2874\n| ICD10 = {{ICD10|H|90|3|h|90}}-{{ICD10|H|90|5|h|90}}|\nICD9 = {{ICD9|389.1}}\n| ICDO = \n| OMIM = \n| MedlinePlus = 003291\n| eMedicineSubj = \n| eMedicineTopic = \n| MeshID = D006319\n}}\n\n{{Diseases of the ear and mastoid process}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sensorineural Hearing Loss}}\n[[Category:Hearing loss]]\n\n[[de:Schwerh\u00f6rigkeit#Schallempfindungsschwerh\u00f6rigkeit]]\n[[ja:\u7a81\u767a\u6027\u96e3\u8074]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Hearing loss caused by an inner ear or vestibulocochlear nerve defect}}\n{{Infobox medical condition (new)\n| name = Sensorineural hearing loss\n| image = Cochlea-crosssection.png\n| caption = Cross section of the cochlea.\n| field = [[Otorhinolaryngology]]\n| treatment = \n}}\n'''Sensorineural hearing loss''' ('''SNHL''') is a type of [[hearing loss]] in which the root cause lies in the [[inner ear]] or sensory organ ([[cochlea]] and associated structures) or the [[vestibulocochlear nerve]] ([[cranial nerve]] VIII).  SNHL accounts for about 90% of reported hearing loss. SNHL is not necessarily permanent and can be mild, moderate, severe, profound, or total. Various other descriptors can be used depending on the shape of the [[audiogram]], such as high frequency, low frequency, U-shaped, notched, peaked, or flat.\n\n''Sensory'' hearing loss often occurs as a consequence of damaged or deficient cochlear [[hair cell]]s.{{disputed inline|date=November 2015}} Hair cells may be abnormal at birth, or damaged during the lifetime of an individual. There are both external causes of damage, including [[Ear infection|infection]], and [[Ototoxicity|ototoxic]] drugs, as well as intrinsic causes, including [[genetic mutations]]. A common cause or exacerbating factor in SNHL is prolonged exposure to environmental noise, or [[noise-induced hearing loss]]. Exposure to a single very loud noise such as a gun shot or bomb blast can cause noise-induced hearing loss. Using headphones at high volume over time, or being in loud environments regularly, such as a loud workplace, sporting events, concerts, and using lawn equipment can also be a risk for noise-induced hearing loss. \n\n''Neural'', or \"retrocochlear\", hearing loss occurs because of damage to the [[cochlear nerve]] (CVIII). This damage may affect the initiation of the nerve impulse in the cochlear nerve or the transmission of the nerve impulse along the nerve into the [[brainstem]].\n\nMost cases of SNHL present with a gradual deterioration of hearing thresholds occurring over years to decades. In some, the loss may eventually affect large portions of the [[hearing range|frequency range]]. It may be accompanied by other symptoms such as ringing in the ears ([[tinnitus]]) and dizziness or lightheadedness ([[vertigo]]). The most common kind of sensorineural hearing loss is age-related ([[presbycusis]]), followed by [[noise-induced hearing loss]] (NIHL).\n\nFrequent symptoms of SNHL are loss of acuity in distinguishing foreground voices against noisy backgrounds, difficulty understanding on the telephone, some kinds of sounds seeming excessively loud or shrill, difficulty understanding some parts of speech ([[fricative]]s and [[sibilant]]s), loss of directionality of sound (especially with high frequency sounds), perception that people mumble when speaking, and difficulty understanding speech. Similar symptoms are also associated with other kinds of hearing loss; audiometry or other diagnostic tests are necessary to distinguish sensorineural hearing loss.\n\nIdentification of sensorineural hearing loss is usually made by performing a [[pure tone audiometry]] (an audiogram) in which bone conduction thresholds are measured. [[Tympanometry]] and [[Audiometry#Subjective audiometry|speech audiometry]] may be helpful. Testing is performed by an [[Audiology#Audiologist|audiologist]].\n\nThere is no proven or recommended treatment or cure for SNHL; management of hearing loss is usually by hearing strategies and hearing aids. In cases of profound or total deafness, a [[cochlear implant]] is a specialised hearing aid which may restore a functional level of hearing. SNHL is at least partially preventable by avoiding environmental noise, ototoxic chemicals and drugs, and head trauma, and treating or inoculating against certain triggering diseases and conditions like [[meningitis]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nSince the [[inner ear]] is not directly accessible to instruments, identification is by patient report of the symptoms and [[Audiometry|audiometric]] testing. Of those who present to their doctor with sensorineural hearing loss, 90% report having diminished hearing, 57% report having a plugged feeling in ear, and 49% report having ringing in ear ([[tinnitus]]). About half report vestibular (vertigo) problems.\n\nFor a detailed exposition of symptoms useful for screening, a self-assessment questionnaire was developed by the [[American Academy of Otolaryngology\u2013Head and Neck Surgery|American Academy of Otolaryngology]], called the Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults (HHIA). It is a 25-question survey of subjective symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Newman CW, Weinstein BE, Jacobson GP, Hug GA | title = Test-retest reliability of the hearing handicap inventory for adults | journal = Ear and Hearing | volume = 12 | issue = 5 | pages = 355\u20137 | date = October 1991 | pmid = 1783240 | doi = 10.1097/00003446-199110000-00009 }}</ref>\n\n==Causes==\nSensorineural hearing loss may be genetic or acquired (i.e. as a consequence of disease, noise, trauma, etc.). People may have a hearing loss from birth ([[congenital]]) or the hearing loss may come on later. Many cases are related to old age (age-related).\n\n===Genetic===\nHearing loss can be inherited.

Some may be [[Point mutation|single point mutations]], whereas others are due to [[chromosomal abnormalities]]. Some genetic causes give rise to a late onset hearing loss. Mitochondrial mutations can cause SNHL i.e. m.1555A>G, which makes the individual sensitive to the ototoxic effects of [[aminoglycoside antibiotics]].\n* The most common cause of recessive genetic congenital hearing impairment in developed countries is [[DFNB1]], also known as Connexin 26 deafness or [[GJB2]]-related deafness.\n* The most common syndromic forms of hearing impairment include (dominant) [[Stickler syndrome]] and [[Waardenburg syndrome]], and (recessive) [[Pendred syndrome]] and [[Usher syndrome]].\n* Mitochondrial mutations causing deafness are rare: [[MT-TL1]] mutations cause [[MIDD]] (Maternally inherited deafness and diabetes) and other conditions which may include deafness as part of the picture. \n* [[TMPRSS3]] gene was identified by its association with both congenital and childhood onset autosomal recessive deafness. This gene is expressed in fetal cochleae and many other tissues, and is thought to be involved in the development and maintenance of the [[inner ear]] or the contents of the [[perilymph]] and [[endolymph]].

It is a common viral infection contracted by contact with infected bodily fluids such as saliva or urine and easily transmitted in nurseries and thus from toddlers to expectant mothers.

One in three persons have significant hearing loss by age 65; by age 75, one in two. Age-related hearing loss is neither preventable nor reversible.\n\n====Noise====\n{{main|Noise-induced hearing loss}}\nMost people living in modern society suffer from some degree of progressive sensorineural (i.e. permanent) noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) resulting from overloading and damaging the sensory or neural apparatus of hearing in the inner ear. NIHL is typically a drop-out or notch centered at 4000&nbsp;Hz. Both intensity (SPL) and duration of exposure, and repetitive exposure to unsafe levels of noise contribute to cochlear damage that results in hearing loss. The louder the noise is, the shorter the safe amount of exposure is. NIHL can be either permanent or temporary, called a threshold shift. Unsafe levels of noise can be as little as 70&nbsp;dB (about twice as loud as normal conversation) if there is prolonged (24-hour) or continuous exposure. 125&nbsp;dB (a loud rock concert is ~120&nbsp;dB) is the pain level; sounds above this level cause instant and permanent ear damage.\n\nNoise and ageing are the primary causes of [[presbycusis]], or age-related hearing loss, the most common kind of hearing loss in industrial society.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gates GA, Mills JH | title = Presbycusis | journal = Lancet | volume = 366 | issue = 9491 | pages = 1111\u201320 | date = September 2005 | pmid = 16182900 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67423-5 | quote = Presbycusis (or presbyacusis) is a general term that refers to hearing loss in the elderly and, as such, represents the contributions of a lifetime of insults to the auditory system. Of these, ageing and noise damage are the chief factors, plus genetic susceptibility, otological disorders, and exposures to ototoxic agents. }}</ref>\n\n{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The dangers of environmental and occupational noise exposure are widely recognized. Numerous national and international organizations have established standards for safe levels of exposure to noise in industry, the environment, military, transportation, agriculture, mining and other areas.<ref group=\"Note\">A few prominent ones are American National Standards Institute (ANSI), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr Normung (DIN), Swedish Standards Institute (SSI), Canadian Standards Association (CSA), British Standards Institute (BSI), Austrian Standards Institute (\u00d6NORM), and in the United States, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and numerous state agencies, and Department of Defense (DOD) among others.</ref> Sound intensity or sound pressure level (SPL) is measured in decibels (dB). For reference:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!db Level\n!Example\n|-\n|45&nbsp;dB\n|Ambient noise level around the home\n|-\n|60&nbsp;dB\n|Quiet office\n|-\n|60\u201365&nbsp;dB\n|Normal conversation\n|-\n|70&nbsp;dB \n|City street noise at 25'{{Clarify|reason=|date=January 2018}} or average TV audio\n|-\n|80&nbsp;dB\n|Noisy office\n|-\n|95\u2013104&nbsp;dB\n|Nightclub dance floor\n|-\n|120&nbsp;dB\n|Close-by thunder or a loud rock concert\n|-\n|150\u2013160&nbsp;dB\n|Gunshot from a handheld gun\n|}\nAn increase of 6&nbsp;dB represents a doubling of the SPL, or energy of the sound wave, and therefore its propensity to cause ear damage. Because human ears hear logarithmically, not linearly, it takes an increase of 10&nbsp;dB to produce a sound that is perceived to be twice as loud. Ear damage due to noise is proportional to sound intensity, not perceived loudness, so it's misleading to rely on subjective perception of loudness as an indication of the risk to hearing, i.e. it can significantly underestimate the danger.\n\nWhile the standards differ moderately in levels of intensity and duration of exposure considered safe, some guidelines can be derived.<ref group=\"Note\">The various standards quantify nose exposure with a set of specified measures, usually with respect to a reference exposure time of 8 hours, a typical working day. The measures include, a weighting scale (usually A) with a sample time, a threshold value in dB, a criterion sound pressure level in dB with an exposure time usually in hours, and an exchange rate in dB. A weighted SPL is denoted dB(X) where X is a weighting scale, usually A, but sometimes C. (A) refers to [[A-weighting]] of SPL, which is an adjustment to measured SPL to compensate for the frequency response of the human ear, which is less sensitive to low frequencies. The criterion level is the average sound pressure level permitted over the exposure time. The threshold sound pressure level is the level above which sound will be integrated into the average. The sample time (fast, slow or impulse) is the rate of sampling&nbsp;\u2014 a slow sample time is 1 second; a fast sample time is 1/8 second, and impulse sample time is 35 milliseconds. The effect of a slower sample time means that very short duration sounds may not be fully sampled (or even sampled at all in rare cases), so the noise exposure may be underestimated. The exchange rate is the amount by which the permitted sound level may increase if the exposure time is halved.</ref>\n\nThe safe amount of exposure is reduced by a factor of 2 for every exchange rate (3&nbsp;dB for NIOSH standard or 5&nbsp;dB for [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] standard) increase in SPL. For example, the safe daily exposure amount at 85&nbsp;dB (90&nbsp;dB for OSHA) is 8 hours, while the safe exposure at 94&nbsp;dB(A) (nightclub level) is only 1 hour. Noise trauma can also cause a reversible hearing loss, called a temporary threshold shift. This typically occurs in individuals who are exposed to gunfire or firecrackers, and hear ringing in their ears after the event ([[tinnitus]]).\n* '''Ambient environmental noise''': Populations living near airports, railyards and train stations, freeways and industrial areas are exposed to levels of noise typically in the 65 to 75 dBA range. If lifestyles include significant outdoor or open window conditions, these exposures over time can degrade hearing. [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|U.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development]] sets standards for noise impact in residential and commercial construction zones. HUD\u2019s noise standards may be found in 24 CFR Part 51, Subpart B.

Also, of the 86 million adults in the U.S. who have prediabetes, the rate of hearing loss is 30 percent higher than in those with normal blood glucose. It has not been established how diabetes is related to hearing loss. It is possible that the high blood glucose levels associated with diabetes cause damage to the small blood vessels in the inner ear, similar to the way in which diabetes can damage the eyes and the kidneys. Similar studies have shown a possible link between that hearing loss and neuropathy (nerve damage).\n* [[Tumor]]\n** Cerebellopontine angle tumour (junction of the [[pons]] and [[cerebellum]]) \u2013 The cerebellopontine angle is the exit site of both the [[facial nerve]](CN7) and the [[vestibulocochlear nerve]](CN8).

M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease is characterized by sudden attacks of vertigo, lasting minutes to hours preceded by [[tinnitus]], aural fullness, and fluctuating hearing loss. It is relatively rare and commonly over diagnosed.\n* Bacterial [[meningitis]] e.g. pneumococcal, meningococcal, haemophilus influenzae may damage the [[cochlea]] \u2013 Hearing loss is one of the most common after-effects of bacterial meningitis. It has been estimated that 30% of bacterial meningitis cases result in mild to profound hearing loss. Children are most at risk: seventy percent of all bacterial meningitis occurs in young children under the age of five.\n* Viral\n**[[AIDS]] and [[AIDS-related complex|ARC]] patients frequently experience auditory system anomalies.\n** [[Mumps]](epidemic parotitis) may result in profound sensorineural hearing loss (90 [[Decibel|dB]] or more), unilaterally (one ear) or bilaterally (both ears).\n** [[Measles]] may result in [[Vestibulocochlear nerve|auditory nerve]] damage but more commonly gives a mixed (sensorineural plus conductive) hearing loss, and can be bilaterally.\n** [[Ramsay Hunt syndrome type II]] (herpes zoster oticus)\n* Bacterial\n** [[Syphilis]] is commonly transmitted from pregnant women to their fetuses, and about a third of the infected children will eventually become deaf.\n\n====Ototoxic and neurotoxic drugs and chemicals====\n{{main|ototoxicity}}\nSome over-the-counter as well as prescription drugs and certain industrial chemicals are ototoxic. Exposure to these can result in temporary or permanent hearing loss.\n\nSome medications cause irreversible damage to the ear, and are limited in their use for this reason. The most important group is the [[aminoglycoside]]s (main member [[gentamicin]]). A rare mitochondrial mutation, m.1555A>G, can increase an individual's susceptibility to the ototoxic effect of aminoglycosides. Long term [[hydrocodone]] (Vicodin) abuse is known to cause rapidly progressing sensorineural hearing loss, usually without vestibular symptoms. [[Methotrexate]], a chemotherapy agent, is also known to cause hearing loss. In most cases hearing loss does not recover when the drug is stopped. Paradoxically, methotrexate is also used in the treatment of autoimmune-induced inflammatory hearing loss.\n\nVarious other medications may reversibly degrade hearing. This includes loop [[diuretic]]s, [[sildenafil]] (Viagra), high or sustained dosing of [[NSAID]]s ([[aspirin]], [[ibuprofen]], [[naproxen]], and various prescription drugs: [[celecoxib]], etc.), [[quinine]], and [[macrolide]] antibiotics ([[erythromycin]], etc.). Cytotoxic agents such as carboplatinum, used to treat malignancies can give rise to a dose dependent SNHL, as can drugs such as desferrioxamine, used for haematological disorders such as thalassaemia; patients prescribed these drugs need to have hearing monitored.\n\nProlonged or repeated environmental or work-related exposure to ototoxic chemicals can also result in sensorineural hearing loss. Some of these chemicals are:\n* [[butyl nitrite]] \u2013 chemical used recreationally known as '[[poppers]]'\n* [[carbon disulfide]] \u2013 a solvent used as a building block in many organic reactions\n* [[styrene]], an industrial chemical precursor of [[polystyrene]], a plastic\n* [[carbon monoxide]], a poisonous gas resulting from incomplete [[combustion]]\n* heavy metals: [[tin]], [[lead]], [[manganese]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]]\n* [[hexane]], an industrial solvent and one of the significant constituents of [[gasoline]]\n* [[ethylbenzene]], an industrial solvent used in the production of styrene\n* [[toluene]] and [[xylene]], highly poisonous petrochemical solvents.

People who sustain head injury are susceptible to hearing loss or tinnitus, either temporary or permanent. Contact sports like football (U.S. NFL), hockey and cricket have a notable incidence of head injuries (concussions). In one survey of retired NFL players, all of whom reported one or more concussions during their playing careers, 25% had hearing loss and 50% had tinnitus.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n====Perinatal conditions====\nThese are much more common in premature babies, particularly those under 1500&nbsp;g at birth. [[Premature birth]] can be associated with problems that result in sensorineural hearing loss such as anoxia or hypoxia (poor oxygen levels), jaundice, intracranial haemorrhages, meningitis. [[Fetal alcohol syndrome]] is reported to cause hearing loss in up to 64% of infants born to [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] mothers, from the [[ototoxicity|ototoxic effect]] on the developing fetus, plus malnutrition during pregnancy from the excess [[ethanol|alcohol]] intake.\n\n====Iodine deficiency / Hypothyroidism====\n[[Iodine deficiency]] and endemic [[hypothyroidism]] are associated with hearing loss.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kochupillai N, Pandav CS, Godbole MM, Mehta M, Ahuja MM | title = Iodine deficiency and neonatal hypothyroidism | journal = Bulletin of the World Health Organization | volume = 64 | issue = 4 | pages = 547\u201351 | date = 1986 | pmid = 3490923 | pmc = 2490891 }}</ref> If a pregnant mother has insufficient iodine intake during pregnancy it affects the development of the inner ear in the foetus leading to sensorineural deafness. This occurs in certain areas of the world, such as the Himalayas, where iodine is deficient in the soil and thus the diet. In these areas there is a high incidence of endemic goitre. This cause of deafness is prevented by adding iodine to salt.\n\n====Brain stroke====\n[[Brain stroke]] in a region affecting auditory function such as a [[posterior circulation infarct]] has been associated with deafness.\n\n==Pathophysiology==\nSensory hearing loss is caused by abnormal structure or function of the [[hair cells]] of the [[organ of Corti]] in the [[cochlea]].{{disputed inline|date=November 2015}} Neural hearing impairments are consequent upon damage to the eighth [[cranial nerve]] (the [[vestibulocochlear nerve]]) or the auditory tracts of the [[brainstem]]. If higher levels of the auditory tract are affected this is known as [[central deafness]]. Central deafness may present as sensorineural deafness but should be distinguishable from the history and audiological testing.\n\n===Cochlear dead regions in sensory hearing loss===\n{{overly detailed|section|date=November 2015}}\nHearing impairment may be associated with damage to the hair cells in the cochlea. Sometimes there may be complete loss of function of inner hair cells (IHCs) over a certain region of the cochlea; this is called a \"dead region\". The region can be defined in terms of the range of characteristic frequencies (CFs) of the IHCs and/or neurons immediately adjacent to the dead region.\n\n====Cochlear hair cells====\n[[File:Cochlea-crosssection.png|left|thumb|280px|Figure 3: Cross-section of the cochlea.]]\n\nOuter [[hair cells]] (OHCs) contribute to the structure of the [[Organ of Corti]], which is situated between the [[basilar membrane]] and the [[tectorial membrane]] within the cochlea (See Figure 3). The tunnel of corti, which runs through the Organ of Corti, divides the OHCs and the inner hair cells (IHCs). OHCs are connected to the reticular laminar and the Deiters\u2019 cells. There are roughly twelve thousand OHCs in each human ear, and these are arranged in up to five rows. Each OHC has small tufts of 'hairs', or cilia, on their upper surface known as [[stereocilia]], and these are also arranged into rows which are graded in height. There are approximately 140 stereocilia on each OHC.<ref name=\"Gelfand\">Gelfand SA. Hearing: An Introduction to Psychological and Physiological Acoustics. 4th ed. New York: Marcel Dekker; 2004.</ref>\n\nThe fundamental role of the OHCs and the IHCs is to function as [[sensory receptors]]. The main function of the IHCs is to transmit sound information via [[afferent neurons]]. They do this by transducing mechanical movements or signals into neural activity. When stimulated, the stereocilia on the IHCs move, causing a flow of electric current to pass through the hair cells. This electric current creates [[action potentials]] within the connected afferent neurons.\n\nOHCs are different in that they actually contribute to the active mechanism of the cochlea. They do this by receiving mechanical signals or vibrations along the basilar membrane, and transducing them into electrochemical signals. The stereocilia found on OHCs are in contact with the tectorial membrane. Therefore, when the basilar membrane moves due to vibrations, the stereocilia bend. The direction in which they bend, dictates the firing rate of the auditory neurons connected to the OHCs.<ref name=\"Moore-Whurr\">Moore BCJ. Cochlear Hearing Loss. London: Whurr Publishers; 1998.</ref>\n\nThe bending of the stereocilia towards the [[basal body]] of the OHC causes excitation of the hair cell. Thus, an increase in firing rate of the auditory neurons connected to the hair cell occurs. On the other hand, the bending of the stereocilia away from the basal body of the OHC causes inhibition of the hair cell. Thus, a decrease in firing rate of the auditory neurons connected to the hair cell occurs. OHCs are unique in that they are able to contract and expand (electromotility). Therefore, in response to the electrical stimulations provided by the efferent nerve supply, they can alter in length, shape and stiffness. These changes influence the response of the basilar membrane to sound.<ref name=\"Gelfand\" /><ref name=\"Moore-Whurr\" /> It is therefore clear that the OHCs play a major role in the active processes of the cochlea.<ref name=\"Gelfand\" /> The main function of the active mechanism is to finely tune the basilar membrane, and provide it with a high sensitivity to quiet sounds. The active mechanism is dependent on the cochlea being in good physiological condition. However, the cochlea is very susceptible to damage.<ref name=\"Moore-Whurr\" />\n\n=====Hair cell damage=====\n\nSNHL is most commonly caused by damage to the OHCs and the IHCs.{{disputed inline|date=November 2015}}  There are two methods by which they might become damaged. Firstly, the entire hair cell might die. Secondly, the stereocilia might become distorted or destroyed. Damage to the cochlea can occur in several ways, for example by viral infection, exposure to ototoxic chemicals, and intense noise exposure. Damage to the OHCs results in either a less effective active mechanism, or it may not function at all. OHCs contribute to providing a high sensitivity to quiet sounds at a specific range of frequencies (approximately 2\u20134&nbsp;kHz). Thus, damage to the OHCs results in the reduction of sensitivity of the basilar membrane to weak sounds. Amplification to these sounds is therefore required, in order for the basilar membrane to respond efficiently. IHCs are less susceptible to damage in comparison to the OHCs. However, if they become damaged, this will result in an overall loss of sensitivity.<ref name=\"Moore-Whurr\" />\n\n===Neural tuning curves===\n\n====Frequency selectivity====\n[[File:Tuning curve.svg|thumb|Figure 4: Neural tuning curve for normal hearing.]]\n\nThe [[traveling wave]] along the basilar membrane peaks at different places along it, depending on whether the sound is low or high frequency. Due to the mass and [[stiffness]] of the basilar membrane, low frequency waves peak in the apex, while high frequency sounds peak in the basal end of the cochlea.<ref name=\"Gelfand\" /> Therefore, each position along the basilar membrane is finely tuned to a particular frequency. These specifically tuned frequencies are referred to as characteristic frequencies (CF).<ref name=\"Moore-Whurr\" />\n\nIf a sound entering the ear is displaced from the characteristic frequency, then the strength of response from the basilar membrane will progressively lessen. The fine tuning of the basilar membrane is created by the input of two separate mechanisms. The first mechanism being a linear passive mechanism, which is dependent on the mechanical structure of the basilar membrane and its surrounding structures. The second mechanism is a non-linear active mechanism, which is primarily dependent on the functioning of the OHCs, and also the general physiological condition of the cochlea itself. The base and apex of the basilar membrane differ in stiffness and width, which cause the basilar membrane to respond to varying frequencies differently along its length. The base of the basilar membrane is narrow and stiff, resulting in it responding best to high frequency sounds. The apex of the basilar membrane is wider and much less stiff in comparison to the base, causing it to respond best to low frequencies.<ref name=\"Moore-Whurr\" />\n\nThis selectivity to certain frequencies can be illustrated by neural tuning curves. These demonstrate the frequencies a fiber responds to, by showing threshold levels [[Decibel#Acoustics|(dB SPL)]] of [[auditory nerve]] fibers as a function of different frequencies. This demonstrates that auditory nerve fibers respond best, and hence have better thresholds at the fiber's characteristic frequency and frequencies immediately surrounding it. The basilar membrane is said to be \u2018sharply tuned\u2019 due to the sharp \u2018V\u2019 shaped curve, with its \u2018tip\u2019 centered at the auditory fibers characteristic frequency. This shape shows how few frequencies a fiber responds to. If it were a broader \u2018V\u2019 shape, it would be responding to more frequencies (See Figure 4).<ref name=\"Gelfand\" />\n\n====IHC vs OHC hearing loss====\n[[File:Tuning curve for OHC loss.jpg|left|frame|Figure 5: Neural tuning curve for OHC loss. Adapted from.<ref name=\"Moore-Whurr\" />]]\n[[File:Tuning curve of OHC front row loss and IHC loss.jpg|frame|Figure 6: Neural tuning curve for OHC front row loss and IHC loss. Adapted from.<ref name=\"Moore-Whurr\" />]]\n\nA normal neural tuning curve is characterised by a broadly tuned low frequency \u2018tail\u2019, with a finely tuned middle frequency \u2018tip\u2019. However, where there is partial or complete damage to the OHCs, but with unharmed IHCs, the resulting tuning curve would show the elimination of sensitivity at the quiet sounds. I.e. where the neural tuning curve would normally be most sensitive (at the \u2018tip\u2019) (See Figure 5).<ref name=\"Moore-Whurr\" />\n\nWhere both the OHCs and the IHCs are damaged, the resulting neural tuning curve would show the elimination of sensitivity at the \u2018tip'. However, due to IHC damage, the whole tuning curve becomes raised, giving a loss of sensitivity across all frequencies (See Figure 6). It is only necessary for the first row of OHCs to be damaged for the elimination of the finely tuned \u2018tip\u2019 to occur. This supports the idea that the incidence of OHC damage and thus a loss of sensitivity to quiet sounds, occurs more than IHC loss.<ref name=\"Moore-Whurr\" />\n\nWhen the IHCs or part of the basilar membrane are damaged or destroyed, so that they no longer function as transducers, the result is a \u2018dead region\u2019. Dead regions can be defined in terms of the characteristic frequencies of the IHC, related to the specific place along the basilar membrane where the dead region occurs. Assuming that there has been no shift in the characteristic frequencies relating to certain regions of the basilar membrane, due to the damage of OHCs. This often occurs with IHC damage. Dead regions can also be defined by the anatomical place of the non-functioning IHC (such as an \u201capical dead region\u201d), or by the characteristic frequencies of the IHC adjacent to the dead region.<ref name=\"pmid15064655\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Moore BC | title = Dead regions in the cochlea: conceptual foundations, diagnosis, and clinical applications | journal = Ear and Hearing | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 98\u2013116 | date = April 2004 | pmid = 15064655 | doi = 10.1097/01.aud.0000120359.49711.d7 }}</ref>\n\n===Dead region audiometry===\n\n====Pure tone audiometry (PTA)====\n\nDead regions affect audiometric results, but perhaps not in the way expected. For example, it may be expected that thresholds would not be obtained at the frequencies within the dead region, but would be obtained at frequencies adjacent to the dead region. Therefore, assuming normal hearing exists around the dead region, it would produce an [[audiogram]] that has a dramatically steep slope between the frequency where a threshold is obtained, and the frequency where a threshold cannot be obtained due to the dead region.<ref name=\"pmid15064655\" />\n\n[[File:Basilar membrane 1.jpg|left|thumb|350px|Figure 7: Response of the basilar membrane to a pure tone.]]\n\n[[File:Basilar membrane 2B.jpg|left|thumb|350px|Figure 8: Response of the basilar membrane to a pure tone, when there is a dead region.]]\n\nHowever, it appears that this is not the case. Dead regions cannot be clearly found via PTA [[audiogram]]s. This may be because although the neurons innervating the dead region, cannot react to vibration at their characteristic frequency. If the basilar membrane vibration is large enough, neurons tuned to different characteristic frequencies such as those adjacent to the dead region, will be stimulated due to the spread of excitation. Therefore, a response from the patient at the test frequency will be obtained. This is referred to as \u201coff-place listening\u201d, and is also known as \u2018off-frequency listening\u2019. This will lead to a false threshold being found. Thus, it appears a person has better hearing than they actually do, resulting in a dead region being missed. Therefore, using PTA alone, it is impossible to identify the extent of a dead region (See Figure 7 and 8).<ref name=\"pmid15064655\" />\n\nConsequently, how much is an audiometric threshold affected by a tone with its frequency within a dead region? This depends on the location of the dead region. Thresholds at low frequency dead regions, are more inaccurate than those at higher frequency dead regions. This has been attributed to the fact that excitation due to vibration of the basilar membrane spreads upwards from the apical regions of the basilar membrane, more than excitation spreads downwards from higher frequency basal regions of the cochlea. This pattern of the spread of excitation is similar to the \u2018upward spread of masking\u2019 phenomenon. If the tone is sufficiently loud to produce enough excitation at the normally functioning area of the cochlea, so that it is above that areas threshold. The tone will be detected, due to off-frequency listening which results in a misleading threshold.<ref name=\"pmid15064655\" />\n\nTo help to overcome the issue of PTA producing inaccurate thresholds within dead regions, masking of the area beyond the dead region that is being stimulated can be used. This means that the threshold of the responding area is sufficiently raised, so that it cannot detect the spread of excitation from the tone. This technique has led to the suggestion that a low frequency dead region may be related to a loss of 40-50&nbsp;dB.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Terkildsen K | year = 1980 | title = Hearing impairment and audiograms | journal = Scand Audiol | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 27\u201331 }} Cited in: {{cite journal | vauthors = Moore BC | title = Dead regions in the cochlea: diagnosis, perceptual consequences, and implications for the fitting of hearing AIDS | journal = Trends in Amplification | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u201334 | date = March 2001 | pmid = 25425895 | pmc = 4168936 | doi = 10.1177/108471380100500102 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Thornton AR, Abbas PJ, Abbas PJ | title = Low-frequency hearing loss: perception of filtered speech, psychophysical tuning curves, and masking | journal = The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume = 67 | issue = 2 | pages = 638\u201343 | date = February 1980 | pmid = 7358904 | doi = 10.1121/1.383888 | bibcode = 1980ASAJ...67..638T }} Cited in: {{cite journal | vauthors = Moore BC | title = Dead regions in the cochlea: diagnosis, perceptual consequences, and implications for the fitting of hearing AIDS | journal = Trends in Amplification | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u201334 | date = March 2001 | pmid = 25425895 | pmc = 4168936 | doi = 10.1177/108471380100500102 }}</ref> However, as one of the aims of PTA is to determine whether or not there is a dead region, it may be difficult to assess which frequencies to mask without the use of other tests.<ref name=\"pmid15064655\" />\n\nBased on research it has been suggested that a low frequency dead region may produce a relatively flat loss, or a very gradually sloping loss towards the higher frequencies. As the dead region will be less detectable due to the upward spread of excitation. Whereas, there may be a more obvious steeply sloping loss at high frequencies for a high frequency dead region. Although it is likely that the slope represents the less pronounced downward spread of excitation, rather than accurate thresholds for those frequencies with non-functioning hair cells. Mid-frequency dead regions, with a small range, appear to have less effect on the patient\u2019s ability to hear in everyday life, and may produce a notch in the PTA thresholds.<ref name=\"pmid15064655\" /> Although it is clear that PTA is not the best test to identify a dead region.<ref name=\"pmid16136791\" />\n\n====Psychoacoustic tuning curves (PTC) and threshold equalizing noise (TEN) tests====\n{{speculation|section|date=November 2015}}\n[[File:Psychoacoustical tuning curvesA.jpg|frame|Figure 9: Psychoacoustical tuning curve.]]\n\nAlthough some debate continues regarding the reliability of such tests,<ref name=\"pmid12677110\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Summers V, Molis MR, M\u00fcsch H, Walden BE, Surr RK, Cord MT | title = Identifying dead regions in the cochlea: psychophysical tuning curves and tone detection in threshold-equalizing noise | journal = Ear and Hearing | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 133\u201342 | date = April 2003 | pmid = 12677110 | doi = 10.1097/01.AUD.0000058148.27540.D9 }}</ref> it has been suggested {{weasel inline|date=November 2015}}that psychoacoustic tuning curves (PTCs) and threshold-equalising noise (TEN) results may be useful in detecting dead regions, rather than PTA. PTCs are similar to neural tuning curves. They illustrate the level of a masker (dB SPL) tone at threshold, as a function of deviation from center frequency (Hz).<ref name=\"Gelfand\" /> They are measured by presenting a fixed low intensity pure tone while also presenting a narrow-band masker, with a varying center frequency. The masker level is varied, so that the level of masker needed to just mask the test signal is found for the masker at each center frequency. The tip of the PTC is where the masker level needed to just mask the test signal is the lowest. For normal hearing people this is when the masker center frequency is closest to the frequency of the test signal (See Figure 9).<ref name=\"pmid16136791\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sek A, Alc\u00e1ntara J, Moore BC, Kluk K, Wicher A | title = Development of a fast method for determining psychophysical tuning curves | journal = International Journal of Audiology | volume = 44 | issue = 7 | pages = 408\u201320 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 16136791 | doi = 10.1080/14992020500060800 }}</ref>\n\nIn the case of dead regions, when the test signal lies within the boundaries of a dead region, the tip of the PTC will be shifted to the edge of the dead region, to the area that is still functioning and detecting the spread of excitation from the signal. In the case of a low frequency dead region, the tip is shifted upwards indicating a low frequency dead region starting at the tip of the curve. For a high frequency dead region, the tip is shifted downwards from the signal frequency to the functioning area below the dead region.<ref name=\"pmid16136791\" /> However, the traditional method of obtaining PTCs is not practical for clinical use, and it has been argued{{weasel inline|date=November 2015}} that TENs are not accurate enough.<ref name=\"pmid16136791\" /><ref name=\"pmid12677110\" /> A fast method for finding PTCs has been developed and it may provide the solution. However, more research to validate this method is required, before it can be accepted clinically.\n\n====Perceptual consequences of a dead region====\n\n[[Audiogram]] configurations are not good indicators of how a dead region will affect a person functionally, mainly due to individual differences.<ref name=\"Moore-Whurr\" /> For example, a sloping audiogram is often present with a dead region, due to the spread of excitation. However, the individual may well be affected differently from someone with a corresponding sloped audiogram caused by partial damage to hair cells rather than a dead region. They will perceive sounds differently, yet the audiogram suggests that they have the same degree of loss. Huss and Moore investigated how hearing impaired patients perceive pure tones, and found that they perceive tones as noisy and distorted, more (on average) than a person without a hearing impairment. However, they also found that the perception of tones as being like noise, was not directly related to frequencies within the dead regions, and was therefore not an indicator of a dead region. This therefore suggests that audiograms, and their poor representation of dead regions, are inaccurate predictors of a patient\u2019s perception of pure tone quality.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Huss M, Moore BC | title = Dead regions and noisiness of pure tones | journal = International Journal of Audiology | volume = 44 | issue = 10 | pages = 599\u2013611 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16315451 | doi = 10.1080/02640410500243962 }}</ref>\n\nResearch by Kluk and Moore  has shown that dead regions may also affect the patient\u2019s perception of frequencies beyond the dead regions. There is an enhancement in the ability to distinguish between tones that differ very slightly in frequency, in regions just beyond the dead regions compared to tones further away. An explanation for this may be that cortical re-mapping has occurred. Whereby, neurons which would normally be stimulated by the dead region, have been reassigned to respond to functioning areas near it. This leads to an over-representation of these areas, resulting in an increased perceptual sensitivity to small frequency differences in tones.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kluk K, Moore BC | title = Dead regions in the cochlea and enhancement of frequency discrimination: Effects of audiogram slope, unilateral versus bilateral loss, and hearing-aid use | journal = Hearing Research | volume = 222 | issue = 1\u20132 | pages = 1\u201315 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17071031 | doi = 10.1016/j.heares.2006.06.020 }}</ref>\n\n===Vestibulocochlear nerve pathology===\n* congenital deformity of the internal auditory canal,\n* neoplastic and pseudo-neoplastic lesions, with special detailed emphasis on schwannoma of the eighth cranial nerve (acoustic neuroma),\n* non-neoplastic Internal Auditory Canal/CerebelloPontine Angle pathology, including vascular loops,\n\n==Diagnosis==\n\n===Case history===\nBefore examination, a case history provides guidance about the context of the hearing loss.\n* major concern\n* pregnancy and childbirth information\n* medical history\n* development history\n* family history\n\n===Otoscopy===\nDirect examination of the external canal and tympanic membrane (ear drum) with an [[otoscope]], a medical device inserted into the ear canal that uses light to examine the condition of the external ear and tympanic membrane, and\nmiddle ear through the semi-translucent membrane.\n\n===Differential testing===\nDifferential testing is most useful when there is unilateral hearing loss, and distinguishes conductive from sensorineural loss.

There is also high frequency pure tone audiometry which tests frequencies from 8000-20,000&nbsp;Hz. PTA can be used to differentiate between conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss and mixed hearing loss. A hearing loss can be described by its degree i.e. mild, moderate, severe or profound, or by its shape i.e. high frequency or sloping, low frequency or rising, notched, U-shaped or 'cookie-bite', peaked or flat.\n\nThere are also other kinds of audiometry designed to test hearing acuity rather than sensitivity (speech audiometry), or to test\nauditory neural pathway transmission (evoked response audiometry).\n\n===Magnetic resonance imaging===\nMRI scans can be used to identify gross structural causes of hearing loss.

They are also useful in cases where a tumour is suspected or to determine the degree of damage in a hearing loss caused by bacterial infection or auto-immune disease. Scanning is of no value in age-related deafness.\n\n==Prevention==\nPresbycusis is the leading cause of SNHL and is progressive and nonpreventable, and at this time, we do not have either somatic or gene therapy to counter heredity-related SNHL. But other causes of acquired SNHL are largely preventable, especially nosocusis type causes. This would involve avoiding environmental noise, and traumatic noise such as rock concerts and nightclubs with loud music. Use of noise attenuation measures like [[Earplug|ear plugs]] is an alternative, as well as learning about the noise levels one is exposed to. Currently, several [https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2014/04/09/sound-apps/ accurate sound level measurement] apps exist.  [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/reducenoiseexposure/default.html Reducing exposure time] can also help manage risk from loud exposures.\n\n==Treatment==\nTreatment modalities fall into three categories: pharmacological, surgical, and management.

Human studies have also yielded promising results, as 160-600 mg of CoQ10 daily was found to reduce hearing loss in people with sudden sensorineural hearing loss and presbycusis (Ahn 2010; Salami 2010; Guastini 2011).

Nine out of ten people with SSHL lose hearing in only one ear. It should be considered a medical emergency. Delaying diagnosis and treatment may render treatment less effective or ineffective.\n\nExperts estimate that SSHL strikes one person per 100 every year, typically adults in their 40s and 50s. The actual number of new cases of SSHL each year could be much higher because the condition often goes undiagnosed.\n\n===Presentation===\nMany people notice that they have SSHL when they wake up in the morning. Others first notice it when they try to use the deafened ear, such as when they use a phone. Still others notice a loud, alarming \"pop\" just before their hearing disappears. People with sudden deafness often become dizzy, have ringing in their ears (tinnitus), or both.\n\n===Diagnosis===\nSSHL is diagnosed via pure tone audiometry. If the test shows a loss of at least 30&nbsp;dB in three adjacent frequencies, the hearing loss is diagnosed as SSHL. For example, a hearing loss of 30&nbsp;dB would make conversational speech sound more like a whisper.\n\n===Causes ===\nOnly 10 to 15 percent of the cases diagnosed as SSHL have an identifiable cause. Most cases are classified as [[idiopathic]], also called sudden idiopathic hearing loss (SIHL) and idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSHL or ISSNHL)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.masseyeandear.org/for-patients/patient-guide/patient-education/diseases-and-conditions/sudden-deafness|title=Sudden Deafness &#124; Massachusetts Eye and Ear|website=Masseyeandear.org|access-date=2016-02-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2010/en#H91.2|title=H91.2|website=ICD-10 Version:2010|year=2010|publisher=apps.who.int}}</ref> The majority of evidence points to some type of inflammation in the inner ear as the most common cause of SSNHL.\n* [[virus|Viral]] \u2013 The swelling may be due to a virus.

It ranges across [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] extending into the United States portion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It is characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the [[bobcat]] (''L. rufus''), the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The lynx is a good swimmer and an agile climber. The Canada lynx stands {{convert|48|\u2013|56|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder and weighs between {{convert|5|and|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. This lynx was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in 1792. Three [[subspecies]] are recognized.\n\nThe Canada lynx is typically [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] like its primary prey, the [[snowshoe hare]]. The strong dependence of this [[Specialist and generalist species|specialist predator]] on snowshoe hares for food leads to an example of a prey-predator cycle. Canada lynxes respond to the cyclic rises and falls over the years in snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada\u2014when hares are scarce lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares and tend to not produce litters, and as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx. The lynx waits for the hare in specific trails or \"ambush beds\", then pounces on it and kills it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck. Individuals of the same sex particularly tend to avoid each other, forming \"intrasexual\" territories. The mating season is roughly a month long (from March to early April). After a gestational period of two to three months, a litter of one to eight kittens is born. Offspring are weaned at 12 weeks.\n\nThis lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Given its abundance throughout its range and no severe threats, this lynx has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]. This lynx is regularly trapped for the international fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada, but is protected in the southern half of its range due to threats such as habitat loss.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIn his 1792 work ''The Animal Kingdom'', Scottish scientific writer [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] [[Scientific description|described]] a [[Lynx (genus)|lynx]] from Canada, giving it the [[Binomial nomenclature|name]] ''Felis lynx canadensis''.<ref name=\"Kerr1792\">{{cite book |last1=Kerr |first1=R. |authorlink=Robert Kerr (writer) |title=[[The Animal Kingdom]] |date=1792 |publisher=A.

It ranges across [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] extending into the United States portion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It is characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the [[bobcat]] (''L. rufus''), the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The lynx is a good swimmer and an agile climber. The Canada lynx stands {{convert|48|\u2013|56|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder and weighs between {{convert|5|and|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. This lynx was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in 1792. Three [[subspecies]] are recognized.\n\nThe Canada lynx is typically [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] like its primary prey, the [[snowshoe hare]]. The strong dependence of this [[Specialist and generalist species|specialist predator]] on snowshoe hares for food leads to an example of a prey-predator cycle. Canada lynxes respond to the cyclic rises and falls over the years in snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada\u2014when hares are scarce lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares and tend to not produce litters, and as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx. The lynx waits for the hare in specific trails or \"ambush beds\", then pounces on it and kills it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck. Individuals of the same sex particularly tend to avoid each other, forming \"intrasexual\" territories. The mating season is roughly a month long (from March to early April). After a gestational period of two to three months, a litter of one to eight kittens is born. Offspring are weaned at 12 weeks.\n\nThis lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Given its abundance throughout its range and no severe threats, this lynx has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]. This lynx is regularly trapped for the international fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada, but is protected in the southern half of its range due to threats such as habitat loss.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIn his 1792 work ''The Animal Kingdom'', Scottish scientific writer [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] [[Scientific description|described]] a [[Lynx (genus)|lynx]] from Canada, giving it the [[Binomial nomenclature|name]] ''Felis lynx canadensis''.<ref name=\"Kerr1792\">{{cite book |last1=Kerr |first1=R. |authorlink=Robert Kerr (writer) |title=[[The Animal Kingdom]] |date=1792 |publisher=A.

Canada lynxes generally avoid open areas despite good prey availability; they face difficulty surviving in heavily logged areas and agricultural land, though they can thrive well in deforested areas which have been left to regenerate for 15 years or more. In the past, the lynx occurred from the northern United States (in 24 States), possibly up to the [[Rocky Mountains]] in [[New Mexico]], to the [[tree line]] in the Arctic through coniferous forests in Alaska and Canada. The lynx continues to occur in most of Alaska and its erstwhile range in Canada. In the United States, the lynx occurs in the  [[Blue Mountains (Pacific Northwest)|Blue Mountains]], [[Cascade Range]] and southern Rocky Mountains, [[Great Lakes region]] and [[New England]].

Their earliest graves were usually dug at random in designated local burial grounds, sometimes marked with upright [[slate]], [[sandstone]] or [[granite]] stones containing factual but inelegant inscriptions. The next generation of colonialists decorated their headstones with carvings; the most impressive examples consists of depictions of death's head; a stylized skull sometimes with wings or crossed bones.<ref name=\"BGov\">\"[https://www.boston.gov/departments/parks-and-recreation/iconography-gravestones-burying-grounds Iconography of Gravestones at Burying Grounds]\". [[Boston City Hall]], October 25 2019. Retrieved April 11 2020</ref>  Early New England puritan [[funerary art]] conveys a practical attitude towards 17th mortality rates; death was an ever present reality of life,<ref>Ludwig(2000), p. 52</ref> and provides an unique insight into their views on mortality and death.\n\nLater examples show the deceased carried by the wings that would apparently take the deceased soul to heaven.<ref name=\"wb206\">Wenhworth (2003), p. 206</ref> From the 1690s the imagery becomes less severe, and began to include winged [[cherubs]] (known as \"soul effigies\") who had fuller faces and rounder and more life-sized eyes and mouths.<ref name=\"BGov\" />\n\nThe minimalist artistry of the earlier designs reflect the puritan's stern religious doctrine, and largely avoided unnecessary decoration or embellishment. In the late 18th century, depictions of coffins, [[urn]]s and willows became common.<ref>Ludwig (2000), p. 82</ref>\n\n== Stonecarvers==\nThe craftsmen and woman who designed and built the headstones were most often locally commissioned generalists who also worked as smiths, leather-workers or printers. They tended to produce locally, and there are no known [[journeyman]] or itinerant carvers producing across a wide geographical area. A significant number of surviving examples share a decorative traditions, which some variation between regions,<ref name=\"d502\" /> and through [[probate]] documentation, newspaper announcements and inscripted signatures, researches have been able to associate the carvers behind particular headstones with identifiable historical people.<ref name=\"BGov\" />\n\nPuritan era carvers were especially preoccupied by economy of [[Line art|line]], [[Geometry|geometric]] shapes and, at times abstract patterns. The show a  unstylized \"primitive\"<ref name=\"r431\">Ludwig (2000), p.431</ref> approach that tended towards simplicity and naturalism. As the approach is not detectable in later American art, the historian Allan Ludwig described it as a \"half-finished experiment in form making. Its place...must therefore be described as one of quite isolation. Nothing of the older tradition remained after 1815 but the silence of a forgotten epoch.\"<ref name=\"r428\">Ludwig (2000), p.428</ref>\n\n==Attitude towards death==\n[[File:New England death Head (c).jpg|upright=1.4|thumb|Death's head, Granary Burial Ground]]\n\nPuritan grave art reflects a deliberate move away from the European [[Baroque|High Baroque]] type. Because its first generation craftsmen developed their craft isolated in the new word, as self thught, their works can be described as [[folk art|folk style]].<ref>Ludwig (2000), p. 244</ref> In this the their output reflects a general move towards a more vernacular and direct mode of expression, but practically, the style allowed the production of  a far greater number of stylized headstones by removing the need for the carvers having deep workshop experience.<ref name=\"l249\" /> Although the New England style was heavily influenced by contemporary or slightly earlier trends in rural England and Scotland,<ref name=\"l249\">Ludwig (2000), p. 249</ref> this was more in terms of iconography and symbols than style.<ref name=\"l258\">Ludwig (2000), p. 258</ref> New England art of the time did not use Biblical allegories, or contain depictions of the [[Christian cross]].<ref name=\"l258\" />\n\nAlthough modern society sharply avoids the reality of everyday disposal of its communities' dead, in puritan society these were common facts of life. Thus, their art reflects a pragmatic approach, embracing realistic imagery that evokes human decay into skulls and bones. Their use of simplistic, line drawn imagery was a deliberate rejection of Catholic [[iconography]], a choice also reflected in the design of their churches, portrait paintings and [[stained glass]].<ref>Garvan (1960), p. 108</ref>\n\n[[File:Christian Hunter More.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.4|Gravestone of Christian Hunter More, wife of [[Richard More (Mayflower passenger)|Richard More]], The Burying Point, [[Salem, Massachusetts]]]]\nA common approach in the 1980s and 1990s in academic literature was to treat these older graveyards as [[museum]]s, that is as \"outdoor, spatially delineated repositories of cultural artifacts\",<ref name=\"m2\">Meyer (1989), chapter 1, p. 2</ref> and as material to understand the thoughts of the people who had created them. The historian [[Terry G. Jordan-Bychkov|Terry G. Jordan]] agrees with this, and said that, given such artifact's density and state of preservation in New   England, \"nowhere else [in America] is it possible to look so deeply into our people's past\".<ref name=\"m2\">Meyer (1989), chapter 1, p. 2</ref> Meyer's takes this further, writing that the grave art of this period \"exhibit patterns of change over temporal spans...and...can in many instances yield valuable cultural insights to a number of discrete time periods, including the present.\"<ref name=\"m2\" /> Following Forbes work, researchers applied [[social sciences]] techniques in interpretation.<ref name=\"m3\" />\n\nThe cultural historian Hijiya urged caution and rose concerns on the prevailing academic approach and methodology, and noted how the early carvers left no account record of their intentions, and so their motives cannot be easily interpreted, and observed that there is no remaining instance of any articulated evidence which indicates even \"their outlook on life and death.\"<ref name=\"h339-40\">Hijiya (1983), pp. 339-340</ref> Although a significant scholar in the field, Hijiya urges that reading into the meaning of any stone has to consider \"information extraneous to the stones themselves\" such as \"writings produced at the same time as the carvings, though by different hands [and] aesthetic or anthropological theory which purports to illuminate human behavior at any time\".<ref name=\"h340\">Hijiya (1983), p. 340</ref> Hijiya suggested an approach similar to the art historian [[Erwin Panofsky]], that there is no reason to assume that any decoration is \"uniquely determined.\"<ref name=\"h340\" />\n\n==Styles==\nHijiya brakes Northeastern American gravestones into six broad and overlapping styles reflective of \"six different attitudes toward death\".<ref name=\"h341\">Hijiya (1983), p. 341</ref> Of these, the first three are strictly \"puritan\", before the style softened as  [[Unitarianism]] and [[Methodism]] became more popular.<ref name=\"d508\">Dethlefsen; Deetz (1966) p. 508</ref>\n\nThe six styles are:\n# \"Plain Style\" (1640-1710): Resignation \n# \"Death's Head\" (1670-1770): Awe\n# \"Angel\" (or \"Cherub\") (1740-1820): Confidence\n# \"Urn and Willow\" (1780-1850): Mourning \n# \"Monumentalism\" (1840-1920): Defiance\n# \"Modem Plain Style\" (1900-2001): Ignorance<ref name=\"h341\" />\n\n===The Plain Style===\nAccording to writer Meg Greene the earliest Puritan New England \"burying grounds were simply places to deposit the remains of the dead\".<ref name=\"G13\" /> \nIn adherence to the second commandment \"[[Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image]]\", the earliest settlers sought to avoid the worship of ancestors through stone images.<ref>Roark (2003), p, 53</ref> In addition they sought to avoid use of the traditional Catholic cross, while table type tombs were seen as too elaborate, practically and aesthetically.<ref>Garvan (1960), p. 112</ref> The graves had little order to their plotting,{{efn-ua|Individual plots were often dug in random spots in the burial ground. See Green (2017), p. 13}}<ref name=\"G13\">Greene (2007), p. 13</ref> and were either unmarked, or were marked a by wooden sign or an uncut rock, with only very few having a simple greenstone or carved [[headstone]],<ref name=\"h342\">Hijiya (1983), p. 342</ref> usually with no decorations or ornamentation.<ref name=\"BGov\" />\n\nWhen inscriptions began to be used, they are at first brief, factual and typically carved with \"interruptive punctuation\", that is an [[interpunct]] (raised period), between each word.<ref name=\"BGov\" /> Full names, kinship, age at death and the year of death are given, while the dating of placement of the stone itself is also present; typically the were commissioned and erected with a year of the burial.<ref name=\"d502\">Dethlefsen; Deetz (1966) p. 502</ref> \n\nBy the mid-17th century, the headstones had become increasingly elaborate, describing the nature and frequency of death in dark, bleak and often bitter imagery.<ref name=\"G13\" /> Soon after, a significant number contain [[epitaphs]], the tone of which is often correlated with the severity or bleakness of the design.<ref name=\"d502\" /> In 1980, the historian Peter Benes described one such graveyard in Plymouth County in terms of \"menacing stares, impish smiles, and enigmatic facial contortions combine with totally abstract effigies to stop the modern viewer in his tracks, while revealing little of their significance\".<ref>Prioli (1980), p. 335</ref>\n\nAccording to Hijiya, the Plain Style \"is hardly a style at all\", consisting of little more than un-ornamented, factual and inscriptions. It begins in the very early Colonial period, and lasts until roughly the first decade of the Eighteenth century. In most scholarly overviews, the amateurish carvings are attributed to a lack of tools, and know-how on the part of the very early practitioners, who did have access to more experienced stonemasons. This explains in part why it remained in some areas later than others; with craftsmen in some areas developing their skills quicker than in others.<ref>Hijiya (1983), pp. 341-342</ref> A further reason may be that the early puritans, due to their feelings on humility and lack of regard for adornments, deliberately kept their headstones simple and minimalist.<ref name=\"h342\" /> Hijiya goes on to say that the lack of decoration may have reflected that they viewed death as simply as an \"ordinary, unremarkable aspect of the human condition\", absent from any notion of either oblivion oe passing on to ethereal life.<ref name=\"h343\">Hijiya (1983), p. 343</ref>\n\n==Inscriptions==\n===Epitaphs===\n[[Epitaph]]s become common from the later 17th century. From these, sit becomes possible to tell something of the attitudes and outlook of both the masons and the deceased.<ref name=\"d502\" /> They often take the format of bleak [[memento mori]]s:<ref name=\"d506\">Dethlefsen; Deetz (1966) p. 506</ref> \n\n{{quote|<poem>\nRemember me as you pass by\nAs you are now so once was I\nAs I am now you soon must be\nPrepare for death and follow me<ref name=\"d506\" /></poem>}}\n \nThese early examples always reflected the pessimistic puritan outlook of the time, in that they do not mention an afterlife or the resurrection of the dead, and often include imagery of worms, decay and dust. It is only on the later cherub stones that more personalised goodbyes to loved ones, or mention of an afterlife begin to appear:<ref name=\"d506\" />\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nFarewell my wife and children dear\nI leave you for a while\nFor God has called and I must go\nAnd leave you all behind.<ref name=\"d506\" /></poem>}}\n\n==Iconography==\n[[File:Boston Puritan.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Winged death headstone in [[Granary Burying Ground]], Boston. 17th century]]\n===Death's head===\nThe death's head is the earliest and most frequently occurring motif in the New England Puritan art. It is most common on older stones, typically the head is winged, and accompanied by engraved imagery such as hourglasses, bones and coffins.<ref name=\"d503\">Dethlefsen; Deetz (1966) p. 503</ref> Though seemingly frightening to modern viewers, the image of a skull was less about dread in Puritan New England, and more an accepted part of the human life cycle.

Their earliest graves were usually dug at random in designated local burial grounds, sometimes marked with upright [[slate]], [[sandstone]] or [[granite]] stones containing factual but inelegant inscriptions. The next generation of colonialists decorated their headstones with carvings; the most impressive examples consists of depictions of death's head; a stylized skull sometimes with wings or crossed bones.<ref name=\"BGov\">\"[https://www.boston.gov/departments/parks-and-recreation/iconography-gravestones-burying-grounds Iconography of Gravestones at Burying Grounds]\". [[Boston City Hall]], October 25 2019. Retrieved April 11 2020</ref>  Early New England puritan [[funerary art]] conveys a practical attitude towards 17th mortality rates; death was an ever present reality of life,<ref>Ludwig(2000), p. 52</ref> and provides an unique insight into their views on mortality and death.\n\nLater examples show the deceased carried by the wings that would apparently take the deceased soul to heaven.<ref name=\"wb206\">Wenhworth (2003), p. 206</ref> From the 1690s the imagery becomes less severe, and began to include winged [[cherubs]] (known as \"soul effigies\") who had fuller faces and rounder and more life-sized eyes and mouths.<ref name=\"BGov\" />\n\nThe minimalist artistry of the earlier designs reflect the puritan's stern religious doctrine, and largely avoided unnecessary decoration or embellishment. In the late 18th century, depictions of coffins, [[urn]]s and willows became common.<ref>Ludwig (2000), p. 82</ref>\n\n== Stonecarvers==\nThe craftsmen and woman who designed and built the headstones were most often locally commissioned generalists who also worked as smiths, leather-workers or printers. They tended to produce locally, and there are no known [[journeyman]] or itinerant carvers producing across a wide geographical area. A significant number of surviving examples share a decorative traditions, which some variation between regions,<ref name=\"d502\" /> and through [[probate]] documentation, newspaper announcements and inscripted signatures, researches have been able to associate the carvers behind particular headstones with identifiable historical people.<ref name=\"BGov\" />\n\nPuritan era carvers were especially preoccupied by economy of [[Line art|line]], [[Geometry|geometric]] shapes and, at times abstract patterns. The show a  unstylized \"primitive\"<ref name=\"r431\">Ludwig (2000), p.431</ref> approach that tended towards simplicity and naturalism. As the approach is not detectable in later American art, the historian Allan Ludwig described it as a \"half-finished experiment in form making. Its place...must therefore be described as one of quite isolation. Nothing of the older tradition remained after 1815 but the silence of a forgotten epoch.\"<ref name=\"r428\">Ludwig (2000), p.428</ref>\n\n==Attitude towards death==\n[[File:New England death Head (c).jpg|upright=1.4|thumb|Death's head, Granary Burial Ground]]\n\nPuritan grave art reflects a deliberate move away from the European [[Baroque|High Baroque]] type. Because its first generation craftsmen developed their craft isolated in the new word, as self thught, their works can be described as [[folk art|folk style]].<ref>Ludwig (2000), p. 244</ref> In this the their output reflects a general move towards a more vernacular and direct mode of expression, but practically, the style allowed the production of  a far greater number of stylized headstones by removing the need for the carvers having deep workshop experience.<ref name=\"l249\" /> Although the New England style was heavily influenced by contemporary or slightly earlier trends in rural England and Scotland,<ref name=\"l249\">Ludwig (2000), p. 249</ref> this was more in terms of iconography and symbols than style.<ref name=\"l258\">Ludwig (2000), p. 258</ref> New England art of the time did not use Biblical allegories, or contain depictions of the [[Christian cross]].<ref name=\"l258\" />\n\nAlthough modern society sharply avoids the reality of everyday disposal of its communities' dead, in puritan society these were common facts of life. Thus, their art reflects a pragmatic approach, embracing realistic imagery that evokes human decay into skulls and bones. Their use of simplistic, line drawn imagery was a deliberate rejection of Catholic [[iconography]], a choice also reflected in the design of their churches, portrait paintings and [[stained glass]].<ref>Garvan (1960), p. 108</ref>\n\n[[File:Christian Hunter More.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.4|Gravestone of Christian Hunter More, wife of [[Richard More (Mayflower passenger)|Richard More]], The Burying Point, [[Salem, Massachusetts]]]]\nA common approach in the 1980s and 1990s in academic literature was to treat these older graveyards as [[museum]]s, that is as \"outdoor, spatially delineated repositories of cultural artifacts\",<ref name=\"m2\">Meyer (1989), chapter 1, p. 2</ref> and as material to understand the thoughts of the people who had created them. The historian [[Terry G. Jordan-Bychkov|Terry G. Jordan]] agrees with this, and said that, given such artifact's density and state of preservation in New   England, \"nowhere else [in America] is it possible to look so deeply into our people's past\".<ref name=\"m2\">Meyer (1989), chapter 1, p. 2</ref> Meyer's takes this further, writing that the grave art of this period \"exhibit patterns of change over temporal spans...and...can in many instances yield valuable cultural insights to a number of discrete time periods, including the present.\"<ref name=\"m2\" /> Following Forbes work, researchers applied [[social sciences]] techniques in interpretation.<ref name=\"m3\" />\n\nThe cultural historian Hijiya urged caution and rose concerns on the prevailing academic approach and methodology, and noted how the early carvers left no account record of their intentions, and so their motives cannot be easily interpreted, and observed that there is no remaining instance of any articulated evidence which indicates even \"their outlook on life and death.\"<ref name=\"h339-40\">Hijiya (1983), pp. 339-340</ref> Although a significant scholar in the field, Hijiya urges that reading into the meaning of any stone has to consider \"information extraneous to the stones themselves\" such as \"writings produced at the same time as the carvings, though by different hands [and] aesthetic or anthropological theory which purports to illuminate human behavior at any time\".<ref name=\"h340\">Hijiya (1983), p. 340</ref> Hijiya suggested an approach similar to the art historian [[Erwin Panofsky]], that there is no reason to assume that any decoration is \"uniquely determined.\"<ref name=\"h340\" />\n\n==Styles==\nHijiya brakes Northeastern American gravestones into six broad and overlapping styles reflective of \"six different attitudes toward death\".<ref name=\"h341\">Hijiya (1983), p. 341</ref> Of these, the first three are strictly \"puritan\", before the style softened as  [[Unitarianism]] and [[Methodism]] became more popular.<ref name=\"d508\">Dethlefsen; Deetz (1966) p. 508</ref>\n\nThe six styles are:\n# \"Plain Style\" (1640-1710): Resignation \n# \"Death's Head\" (1670-1770): Awe\n# \"Angel\" (or \"Cherub\") (1740-1820): Confidence\n# \"Urn and Willow\" (1780-1850): Mourning \n# \"Monumentalism\" (1840-1920): Defiance\n# \"Modem Plain Style\" (1900-2001): Ignorance<ref name=\"h341\" />\n\n===The Plain Style===\nAccording to writer Meg Greene the earliest Puritan New England \"burying grounds were simply places to deposit the remains of the dead\".<ref name=\"G13\" /> \nIn adherence to the second commandment \"[[Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image]]\", the earliest settlers sought to avoid the worship of ancestors through stone images.<ref>Roark (2003), p, 53</ref> In addition they sought to avoid use of the traditional Catholic cross, while table type tombs were seen as too elaborate, practically and aesthetically.<ref>Garvan (1960), p. 112</ref> The graves had little order to their plotting,{{efn-ua|Individual plots were often dug in random spots in the burial ground. See Green (2017), p. 13}}<ref name=\"G13\">Greene (2007), p. 13</ref> and were either unmarked, or were marked a by wooden sign or an uncut rock, with only very few having a simple greenstone or carved [[headstone]],<ref name=\"h342\">Hijiya (1983), p. 342</ref> usually with no decorations or ornamentation.<ref name=\"BGov\" />\n\nWhen inscriptions began to be used, they are at first brief, factual and typically carved with \"interruptive punctuation\", that is an [[interpunct]] (raised period), between each word.<ref name=\"BGov\" /> Full names, kinship, age at death and the year of death are given, while the dating of placement of the stone itself is also present; typically the were commissioned and erected with a year of the burial.<ref name=\"d502\">Dethlefsen; Deetz (1966) p. 502</ref> \n\nBy the mid-17th century, the headstones had become increasingly elaborate, describing the nature and frequency of death in dark, bleak and often bitter imagery.<ref name=\"G13\" /> Soon after, a significant number contain [[epitaphs]], the tone of which is often correlated with the severity or bleakness of the design.<ref name=\"d502\" /> In 1980, the historian Peter Benes described one such graveyard in Plymouth County in terms of \"menacing stares, impish smiles, and enigmatic facial contortions combine with totally abstract effigies to stop the modern viewer in his tracks, while revealing little of their significance\".<ref>Prioli (1980), p. 335</ref>\n\nAccording to Hijiya, the Plain Style \"is hardly a style at all\", consisting of little more than un-ornamented, factual and inscriptions. It begins in the very early Colonial period, and lasts until roughly the first decade of the Eighteenth century. In most scholarly overviews, the amateurish carvings are attributed to a lack of tools, and know-how on the part of the very early practitioners, who did have access to more experienced stonemasons. This explains in part why it remained in some areas later than others; with craftsmen in some areas developing their skills quicker than in others.<ref>Hijiya (1983), pp. 341-342</ref> A further reason may be that the early puritans, due to their feelings on humility and lack of regard for adornments, deliberately kept their headstones simple and minimalist.<ref name=\"h342\" /> Hijiya goes on to say that the lack of decoration may have reflected that they viewed death as simply as an \"ordinary, unremarkable aspect of the human condition\", absent from any notion of either oblivion oe passing on to ethereal life.<ref name=\"h343\">Hijiya (1983), p. 343</ref>\n\n==Inscriptions==\n===Epitaphs===\n[[Epitaph]]s become common from the later 17th century. From these, sit becomes possible to tell something of the attitudes and outlook of both the masons and the deceased.<ref name=\"d502\" /> They often take the format of bleak [[memento mori]]s:<ref name=\"d506\">Dethlefsen; Deetz (1966) p. 506</ref> \n\n{{quote|<poem>\nRemember me as you pass by\nAs you are now so once was I\nAs I am now you soon must be\nPrepare for death and follow me<ref name=\"d506\" /></poem>}}\n \nThese early examples always reflected the pessimistic puritan outlook of the time, in that they do not mention an afterlife or the resurrection of the dead, and often include imagery of worms, decay and dust. It is only on the later cherub stones that more personalised goodbyes to loved ones, or mention of an afterlife begin to appear:<ref name=\"d506\" />\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nFarewell my wife and children dear\nI leave you for a while\nFor God has called and I must go\nAnd leave you all behind.<ref name=\"d506\" /></poem>}}\n\n==Iconography==\n[[File:Boston Puritan.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Winged death headstone in [[Granary Burying Ground]], Boston. 17th century]]\n===Death's head===\nThe death's head is the earliest and most frequently occurring motif in the New England Puritan art. It is most common on older stones, typically the head is winged, and accompanied by engraved imagery such as hourglasses, bones and coffins.<ref name=\"d503\">Dethlefsen; Deetz (1966) p. 503</ref> Though seemingly frightening to modern viewers, the image of a skull was less about dread in Puritan New England, and more an accepted part of the human life cycle.
