The series is primarily set in the fictional location of White Hart Woods, and, later, Sanctuary Lake. The series is published by [[HarperCollins]] and written by authors [[Kate Cary]], [[Cherith Baldry]], and [[Tui T. Sutherland]], with the plot developed by editor [[Victoria Holmes]] under the collective pseudonym [[Erin Hunter]].\n\nThere are currently seven sub-series, each containing six books except for the seventh sub-series, which is currently in progress. The first, ''Warriors'' (later re-titled ''Warriors: The Prophecies Begin''), was published from 2003 to 2004, and details the adventures of a kittypet named Rusty, later Firepaw, Fireheart, and Firestar, who is named after his bright orange pelt, joins thunderclan, and  a Prophecy of him, \"Fire will save the clans\". ''Warriors: The New Prophecy'', published from 2005 to 2006, follows the first sub-series, chronicling the Clans' journey to a new home. The third story arc, ''Warriors: Power of Three'', was published from 2007 to 2009, and centres around a prophecy about three cats with extraordinary powers. The fourth sub-series, ''Warriors: Omen of the Stars'', was published from 2009 to 2012 and continues the story arc of ''Warriors: Power of Three''. The fifth sub-series, ''Warriors: Dawn of the Clans'', was published from 2013 to 2015. This prequel series arc details the formation of the Clans. The sixth sub-series, ''Warriors: A Vision of Shadows,'' was published from 2016 to 2018. Chronologically, ''Warriors: A Vision of Shadows'' follows ''Warriors: Omen of the Stars''. The seventh sub-series is entitled ''Warriors: The Broken Code''. The first book in the seventh series, ''Lost Stars'', was released on 9 April 2019.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062823526/warriors-the-broken-code-1-lost-stars/ | title=Warriors: The Broken Code #1: Lost Stars | publisher=Harper Collins Publishers | accessdate=5 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nOther books have been released in addition to the main series, including eleven lengthier stand-alone \"Super Edition\" novels, several e-book novellas later published in five print compilations, six guide books, and several volumes of [[original English-language manga]], initially produced as a collaboration between HarperCollins and [[TOKYOPOP]] before the latter's closure. The series has also been translated into several languages. [[Alibaba Pictures]] has acquired the [[Warriors (upcoming film)|film rights]] to the series as of 2016.\n\nMajor themes in the series include adventure, forbidden love, the concept of [[Nature versus nurture|nature vs. nurture]], acceptance, the struggle of good vs. evil, the reactions of different faiths meeting each other, and all cats  being a mix of good and bad. The authors draw inspiration from several natural locations and other authors such as [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[J. K. Rowling]], and [[William Shakespeare]].\n\n''Warriors'' has received mostly positive reviews. And nominated for several awards, ''Warriors'' has yet to receive any major literary prizes. Several novels in the series have reached the [[New York Times Bestseller List|''New York Times'' Bestseller List]], and the series has found popularity in many countries, including [[Trinidad]], the U.K, Germany, and China.\n\n==Inspiration and origins==\n[[File:Alder trees beaulieu river fawley ford.jpg|thumb|175px|[[New Forest]], which became the base for the forest the cats live in]]\nThe series first began when publisher [[HarperCollins]] asked Victoria Holmes to write a fantasy series about feral cats. Holmes was initially not enthusiastic, since she \"couldn't imagine coming up with enough ideas\". She worked with the concept, however, expanding the storyline with elements of war, politics, revenge, doomed love, and religious conflict.<ref name=\"Postchat6\">{{cite web|url=http://wandsandworlds.com/community/ErinHunter6-postchat|title=Transcript of Erin Hunter Post Chat 6|accessdate=24 July 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201055534/http://wandsandworlds.com/community/ErinHunter6-postchat|archivedate=1 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Although the original plan was for a stand-alone novel, enough material was created for several books, and the publisher decided on a six-volume series.<ref name=\"Postchat6\"/> The first volume, ''Into the Wild'', was written by Kate Cary under the pseudonym \"Erin Hunter\" and was completed in about three months.<ref name=\"FirstChat\"/> Holmes then began to work behind the scenes, editing and supervising details.<ref name=\"Writers Unboxed\">{{cite web|url=http://writerunboxed.com/2006/04/21/author-interview-erin-hunter/|title=INTERVIEW: Erin Hunter|work=Writers Unboxed|accessdate=2 August 2008}}</ref> [[Cherith Baldry]] joined the team to write the third book, ''Forest of Secrets''.

In an online author chat, [[Cherith Baldry]] listed the authors that inspire her as including [[Tolkien]], [[Ursula K. Le Guin]], and [[Shakespeare]]. In the same chat, [[Victoria Holmes]] stated that [[Jacqueline Wilson]], [[Kathy Reichs]], and [[J. K.

[[Nicholas Culpeper]], a physician who used materials occurring in the natural world as medicine, also had an influence on the ''Warriors'' series. His book, ''Culpeper's Herbal'', is used as a source by the authors for the many herbal remedies that the cats use in the books. In addition, the authors suggested that they may use some fan-created character names in future books.<ref name=\"FourthChat\"/><ref name=\"SeventhChat\">{{cite web|url=http://wandsandworlds.com/community/node/9725|title=Erin Hunter Chat No. 7 Transcript&nbsp;\u2013 part 1|work=Wands And Worlds|accessdate=12 September 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101001234215/http://wandsandworlds.com/community/node/9725|archivedate=1 October 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The film series [[Rambo (film series)|Rambo]] has also been cited as a source of inspiration.<ref name=\"SeventhChatP2\">{{cite web|url=http://wandsandworlds.com/community/node/9726|title=Erin Hunter Chat No. 7 Transcript&nbsp;\u2013 part 2|work=Wands And Worlds|accessdate=12 September 2010|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130111131419/http://wandsandworlds.com/community/node/9726|archive-date=11 January 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Setting and Universe==\n{{see also|List of Warriors characters}}\n\nThe ''Warriors'' universe centres around a large group of [[feral]] cats who initially reside in a forest, and later, around a lake after fleeing their initial home due to its destruction by humans. The cats are split into four groups called Clans: ThunderClan lives in woodland areas, WindClan resides on the [[Moorland|moors]], RiverClan by the river, and ShadowClan within and around the swamps. SkyClan, a subsequently introduced fifth group, is revealed to have been a part of this system but was forced to flee when their territory was destroyed by humans for urban development. Each Clan has adapted to their own terrain; RiverClan cats, for example, swim in the river to catch fish, while the majority of cats from the other Clans fear and avoid bodies of water. Relationships between different Clans are tense and they often come into conflict with one another. However, the Clans also sometimes show concern for each other; the idea of one Clan being destroyed usually causes deep distress and prompts urgent action on behalf of all four Clans.\n\nThe Clan cats have a faith system based on the concept of StarClan, a group of the spirits of the Clans' deceased ancestors who provide guidance to the living Clan cats, usually those of the Clan in which they resided in life. After death, the spirits of most Clan cats join StarClan. StarClan often provides guidance to the Clans through dreams and other signs like [[omen]]s, most often directed towards each Clan's medicine cats, part of whose role it is to commune with StarClan, in addition to providing medical care to their Clan. In addition to StarClan, there exists the Dark Forest, also known as The Place of No Stars, which takes the form of a never-ending forest. The spirits of cats who caused great pain and suffering to others while alive walk alone there as a form of punishment. Although cats of the Dark Forest are meant to be isolated as punishment, they eventually learn how to appear in the dreams of living cats much the way StarClan does.\n\nCats who live outside of the Clans are categorized into three groups. [[Housecats]], referred to as \"kittypets\" by Clan cats, are often looked down upon by the Clan cats for their cozy and lazy lifestyle. \"Loners\" are feral cats who live outside of the Clans, usually by themselves. They are often regarded by the Clans with suspicion. Similar to loners are \"rogues\", who differ in that they try to cause the Clan cats harm. It is rare, though not unheard of, for a kittypet, loner, or rogue to join a Clan, as outsiders are generally distrusted by Clan cats. In several instances, Clans that have taken in outsiders have been met with scorn by the other Clans.\n\nBeyond the Clans' territories lies a mountain range, inhabited by the Tribe of Rushing Water (often referred to simply as the Tribe), a group of cats who follow a different set of ancestors: the Tribe of Endless Hunting. The Tribe has a different hierarchical structure than the Clans, consisting of a Healer, cave-guards, and prey-hunters, who each serve a different function in the Tribe. The Healer leads the Tribe, heals the ill and wounded, and communicates with the Tribe of Endless Hunting; the cave-guards defend the Tribe and the prey-hunters hunt for the Tribe. In a subsequent prequel series, it is revealed that the Tribe was formed by the predecessors of the Clans when they left the [[lake]] territory to live in the mountains. In turn, cats from the Tribe later moved to the forest of the original series and formed the Clans.\n\n==Series==\n===''Warriors: The Prophecies Begin''===\n{{Main|Warriors (arc)}}\nThe original ''Warriors'' series, later re-titled ''Warriors: The Prophecies Begin'',<ref name=\"KateTwitter\"/> was released from 2003 to 2004 and consists of six books: ''[[Into the Wild (Warriors)|Into the Wild]]'' (21 January 2003), ''[[Fire and Ice (Warriors)|Fire and Ice]]'' (27 May 2003), ''[[Forest of Secrets (Warriors)|Forest of Secrets]]'' (14 October 2003), ''[[Rising Storm (Warriors)|Rising Storm]]'' (6 January 2004), ''[[A Dangerous Path (Warriors)|A Dangerous Path]]'' (1 June 2004), and ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]'' (5 October 2004).<ref name=\"ITWHarper\">{{cite web|title=Warriors #1: Into the Wild|publisher=HarperCollins|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/9780060000028/warriors-1-into-the-wild|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-2-Fire-Ice-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060000035|title=HarperCollins: Warriors #2: Fire and Ice by Erin Hunter(Hardcover)|accessdate=23 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021020154/http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-2-Fire-Ice-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060000035|archive-date=21 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-3-Forest-Secrets-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060000042|title=Warriors #3: Forest of Secrets by Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|accessdate=1 August 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021020820/http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-3-Forest-Secrets-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060000042|archive-date=21 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-4-Rising-Storm-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060000059|title=Warriors #4: Rising Storm by Erin Hunter (Hardcover)|publisher=HarperCollins|accessdate=8 August 2010|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/68wC5eTgl?url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-4-Rising-Storm-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060000059|archive-date=5 July 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-5-Dangerous-Path-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060000066|title=Warriors #5: A Dangerous Path by Erin Hunter (Hardcover)|publisher=HarperCollins|accessdate=9 August 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021053629/http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-5-Dangerous-Path-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060000066|archive-date=21 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-6-Darkest-Hour-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060000073|title=The Darkest Hour by Erin Hunter (Hardcover)|publisher=HarperCollins|accessdate=21 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021082009/http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-6-Darkest-Hour-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060000073|archive-date=21 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The series was subtitled ''The Prophecies Begin'' for its re-release with new covers in 2015.<ref name=\"KateTwitter\">{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/KatieThreeCats/status/517970484827549696|quote=The first Warriors series is finally to get its own name with its relaunch next year: \"The Prophecies Begin\".

To combat this, one cat from all four Clan\u2019s is chosen to journey and find a new home for the cats to live. These cats are Tawnypelt of ShadowClan, Crowpaw (later Crowfeather) of WindClan, Feathertail of RiverClan, and Brambleclaw of ThunderClan, the latter of whom also struggles with his heritage as the late Tigerstar\u2019s son. Feathertail\u2019s brother Stormfur and the ThunderClan apprentice Squirrelpaw (later Squirrelflight) also accompany them.\n\nThe first book, \"Midnight\" mainly revolves around the four chosen cats having their dream and leaving with Squirrelpaw/flight and Stormfur. Then, making a perilous journey and finding \"Midnight\", a wise badger. They then have to deliver a cryptic message from her which meant that the clans had to leave their home and that \"a dying warrior will show the way\". They decide to go over the mountains as it's safer than the route they took to get there.\n\nThe second book's main theme is the six getting through the mountains and getting home alive. They meet The Tribe Of Rushing Water who tries to keep Stormfur, believing him to be the cat who will save them from Sharptooth, a [[mountain lion]]. It turns out to be Feathertail who is the silver cat destined to save the tribe and she dies plunging a rock into its neck, killing it. It also says that Leafpaw/pool gets trapped by the Twolegs ([[humans]]), who don<nowiki>'t want cats getting in their way when they destroy the forest. It ends with Leafpaw/pool captured and the now five cats seeing their home. The middle books focus on a journey that all the clans go on together to get to their new home. The last two books mainly focus on a vision that \"Blood will spill blood and the lake will turn red\"</nowiki>.\n\n===''Warriors: Power of Three''===\n{{main|Warriors: Power of Three}}\nThe third series, ''Warriors: Power of Three'', was released from 2007 to 2009 and consists of six books: ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]'' (24 April 2007), ''[[Dark River (Warriors)|Dark River]]'' (26 December 2007), ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]'' (22 April 2008), ''[[Eclipse (Warriors)|Eclipse]]'' (2 September 2008), ''[[Long Shadows]]'' (25 November 2008), and ''[[Sunrise (novel)|Sunrise]]'' (21 April 2009).<ref name=\"DRHarper\">{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/9780060892050/warriors-power-of-three-2-dark-river|title=Warriors: Power of Three #2: Dark River|publisher=HarperCollins|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"OutcastHarper\">{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/9780060892081/warriors-power-of-three-3-outcast|title=Warriors: Power of Three #3: Outcast|publisher=HarperCollins|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/9780060892111/Warriors_Power_of_Three_4_Eclipse/index.aspx|publisher=HarperCollins|accessdate=10 August 2013|title=Warriors: Power of Three #4: Eclipse}}</ref><ref name=\"SunriseHarper\">{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/9780060892180/warriors-power-of-three-6-sunrise|title=Warriors: Power of Three #6: Sunrise|publisher=HarperCollins|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.ca/books/Warriors-Power-of-Three-5-Long-Shadows/?isbn=9780060892142 |title=Warriors: Power of Three #5: Long Shadows|work=HarperCollins|accessdate=10 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.ca/books/Warriors-Power-of-Three-1-The-Sight/?isbn=9780060892012|title=Warriors: Power of Three #1:The Sight|work=HarperCollins|accessdate=10 August 2013}}</ref> The plot is centered on the prophecy, ''\"There will be three, kin of your kin, who hold the power of the stars in their paws\"'', which was given to Firestar in ''[[Firestar's Quest]]'' by Skywatcher.<ref name=FQBook>{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Erin|title=Firestar's Quest|year=2007|url=http://www.harpercollinschildrens.com/Books/Firestars-Quest|publisher=HarperCollins}}</ref> The series revolves around Jayfeather, Hollyleaf, and Lionblaze, children of Brambleclaw and Squirrelflight, and grandchildren of the ThunderClan leader Firestar, who discover that they each have a unique power.

These relationships are not allowed for various reasons: some involve medicine cats, who are not allowed to have mates according to the medicine cat code, while others develop between cats in different Clans, which is also forbidden by the warrior code (for example, Graystripe of ThunderClan and Silverstream of RiverClan). Holmes said that another central theme of the series is \"faith and spirituality\" in StarClan.<ref name=fifthchat>{{cite web|title=Erin Hunter chat #5 transcript - August 16, 2008|url=http://wandsandworlds.com/community/node/5784|work=Wands and Worlds|accessdate=30 March 2013|date=16 August 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017050931/http://wandsandworlds.com/community/node/5784|archivedate=17 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  All books in the series feature the influence of StarClan, not just as the cats think of them, but in terms of prophecies delivered by StarClan which inevitably come true.  Some scenes take place within StarClan's realm, with no living cats present as point-of-view characters.  Thus the existence of an afterlife and the influence of spirits who have passed on and yet retain their earthly identities is integral to all of the plot arcs in the series. Another idea explored in the novels is the reactions of different faiths when meeting each other. For example, the Tribe of Rushing Water, which believes in different spiritual ancestors than the Clans, is introduced in ''Moonrise''. In an author chat, Holmes explained that the books never say that either of the Clans or the Tribe of Rushing Water is right about faith because both are \"equally valid.\" This leads to fear and suspicion between them because they are afraid of things they do not understand. Holmes said that \"ignorance is a very scary thing!\"<ref name=\"Second Chat\">{{cite web|title=Erin Hunter chat #2|url=http://wandsandworlds.com/community/node/124|work=Wands and Worlds |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010001755/http://wandsandworlds.com/community/node/124 |archivedate=10 October 2007}}</ref> Non-belief is also significant in the storylines: Mothwing and Cloudtail do not believe in StarClan.<ref name=\"Chat3part2\">{{cite web|url=http://wandsandworlds.com/community/node/882|title=Erin Hunter Chat No. 3 Transcript&nbsp;\u2014 part 2|work=Wands and Worlds|accessdate=2 March 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222012441/http://wandsandworlds.com/community/node/882|archivedate=22 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Kittypets, loners, and rouges were also a very important theme (at least for Erin Hunter).\n\nAnother theme is that characters can be a mix of good and evil. Holmes has said she is fascinated by these \"shades of gray\" in personalities. Her example of this was when Bluestar, a noble and honorable cat, gave up her kits for her own ambitions so an evil cat would not take over. Another example she gave of this is how the antagonist Tigerstar, even with all of his faults, is still courageous and fiercely loyal.<ref name=\"Nick\"/> Similarly, Holmes has also connected the theme to Brambleclaw and how nobody knew whether he was good or evil.<ref name=\"FourthChat\" /> A third major theme, often referred to as [[nature versus nurture]], explores whether a person is born the way he or she will be, or if other things shape that. For example, Brambleclaw's father is the evil Tigerstar, but he eventually demonstrates that despite this, he is not evil himself, despite initial suspicion from Clanmates due to his father's legacy. This theme ties into the \"shades of gray\" theme.<ref name=\"Second Chat\" /> similar to the book \u00a8Forest dogs\u00a8.\n\nA reviewer for ''Publishers Weekly'' noted that friendship and responsibility are taught to characters in the novels,<ref name=\"publishers-weekly\"/> while booksforyouths.com had a reviewer who pointed out the idea that, just as Clan cats shun house cats for their soft life, people should realize that it is necessary to experience hardship in life.<ref name=booksforyouths>{{cite web|url=http://booksforyouth.wordpress.com/2009/05/14/into-the-wild-warriors-book-1-by-erin-hunter/|title=booksforyouth Review|date=14 May 2009|publisher=booksforyouth.com|accessdate=20 July 2010}}</ref> A Storysnoops review noted that one of the themes was that \"it doesn't matter where you come from, only who you are inside\".<ref name=\"fireandicereview\">{{cite web|url=http://storysnoops.com/detail.php?id=248|title=Storysnoops Review|publisher=storysnoops.com|accessdate=23 July 2010}}</ref> In ''Dawn'', the importance of cooperation is explored.

The second of two plays by Erin Hunter, ''Brightspirit's Mercy'' is about Jaypaw, Lionblaze, and Hollyleaf. After going to a Gathering, where it is obvious all of the Clans except for ThunderClan are starving, three cats from StarClan appear to them: Brightspirit and her parents, Shiningheart and Braveheart, characters created on ''Wands and Worlds'', a fantasy fiction forum, in memory of a 10-year-old ''Warriors'' fan, Emmy Grace Cherry, and her parents, Dana and Jimmy Cherry, who were killed in a tornado in February 2007.<ref name=brightspirit>{{cite web|url=http://www.brightspiritrelieffund.com|title=Brightspirit Relief Fund|work=IMC studios}}</ref> They tell the three young cats that they must help feed the other Clans.

Ashfoot, WindClan's deputy, accepts the gift, but Breezepaw, too proud to have help from another Clan, refuses to eat it.

The series is primarily set in the fictional location of White Hart Woods, and, later, Sanctuary Lake. The series is published by [[HarperCollins]] and written by authors [[Kate Cary]], [[Cherith Baldry]], and [[Tui T. Sutherland]], with the plot developed by editor [[Victoria Holmes]] under the collective pseudonym [[Erin Hunter]].\n\nThere are currently seven sub-series, each containing six books except for the seventh sub-series, which is currently in progress. The first, ''Warriors'' (later re-titled ''Warriors: The Prophecies Begin''), was published from 2003 to 2004, and details the adventures of a kittypet named Rusty, later Firepaw, Fireheart, and Firestar, who is named after his bright orange pelt, joins thunderclan, and  a Prophecy of him, \"Fire will save the clans\". ''Warriors: The New Prophecy'', published from 2005 to 2006, follows the first sub-series, chronicling the Clans' journey to a new home. The third story arc, ''Warriors: Power of Three'', was published from 2007 to 2009, and centres around a prophecy about three cats with extraordinary powers. The fourth sub-series, ''Warriors: Omen of the Stars'', was published from 2009 to 2012 and continues the story arc of ''Warriors: Power of Three''. The fifth sub-series, ''Warriors: Dawn of the Clans'', was published from 2013 to 2015. This prequel series arc details the formation of the Clans. The sixth sub-series, ''Warriors: A Vision of Shadows,'' was published from 2016 to 2018. Chronologically, ''Warriors: A Vision of Shadows'' follows ''Warriors: Omen of the Stars''. The seventh sub-series is entitled ''Warriors: The Broken Code''. The first book in the seventh series, ''Lost Stars'', was released on 9 April 2019.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062823526/warriors-the-broken-code-1-lost-stars/ | title=Warriors: The Broken Code #1: Lost Stars | publisher=Harper Collins Publishers | accessdate=5 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nOther books have been released in addition to the main series, including eleven lengthier stand-alone \"Super Edition\" novels, several e-book novellas later published in five print compilations, six guide books, and several volumes of [[original English-language manga]], initially produced as a collaboration between HarperCollins and [[TOKYOPOP]] before the latter's closure. The series has also been translated into several languages. [[Alibaba Pictures]] has acquired the [[Warriors (upcoming film)|film rights]] to the series as of 2016.\n\nMajor themes in the series include adventure, forbidden love, the concept of [[Nature versus nurture|nature vs. nurture]], acceptance, the struggle of good vs. evil, the reactions of different faiths meeting each other, and all cats  being a mix of good and bad. The authors draw inspiration from several natural locations and other authors such as [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[J. K. Rowling]], and [[William Shakespeare]].\n\n''Warriors'' has received mostly positive reviews. And nominated for several awards, ''Warriors'' has yet to receive any major literary prizes. Several novels in the series have reached the [[New York Times Bestseller List|''New York Times'' Bestseller List]], and the series has found popularity in many countries, including [[Trinidad]], the U.K, Germany, and China.\n==Inspiration and origins==\n[[File:Alder trees beaulieu river fawley ford.jpg|thumb|175px|[[New Forest]], which became the base for the forest the cats live in]]\nThe series first began when publisher [[HarperCollins]] asked Victoria Holmes to write a fantasy series about feral cats. Holmes was initially not enthusiastic, since she \"couldn't imagine coming up with enough ideas\". She worked with the concept, however, expanding the storyline with elements of war, politics, revenge, doomed love, and religious conflict.<ref name=\"Postchat6\">{{cite web|url=http://wandsandworlds.com/community/ErinHunter6-postchat|title=Transcript of Erin Hunter Post Chat 6|accessdate=24 July 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201055534/http://wandsandworlds.com/community/ErinHunter6-postchat|archivedate=1 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Although the original plan was for a stand-alone novel, enough material was created for several books, and the publisher decided on a six-volume series.<ref name=\"Postchat6\"/> The first volume, ''Into the Wild'', was written by Kate Cary under the pseudonym \"Erin Hunter\" and was completed in about three months.<ref name=\"FirstChat\"/> Holmes then began to work behind the scenes, editing and supervising details.<ref name=\"Writers Unboxed\">{{cite web|url=http://writerunboxed.com/2006/04/21/author-interview-erin-hunter/|title=INTERVIEW: Erin Hunter|work=Writers Unboxed|accessdate=2 August 2008}}</ref> [[Cherith Baldry]] joined the team to write the third book, ''Forest of Secrets''.

The cats are split into four groups called Clans: ThunderClan lives in woodland areas, WindClan resides on the [[Moorland|moors]], RiverClan by the river, and ShadowClan within and around the swamps. SkyClan, a subsequently introduced fifth group, is revealed to have been a part of this system but was forced to flee when their territory was destroyed by humans for urban development. Each Clan has adapted to their own terrain; RiverClan cats, for example, swim in the river to catch fish, while the majority of cats from the other Clans fear and avoid bodies of water. Relationships between different Clans are tense and they often come into conflict with one another. However, the Clans also sometimes show concern for each other; the idea of one Clan being destroyed usually causes deep distress and prompts urgent action on behalf of all four Clans.\n\nThe Clan cats have a faith system based on the concept of StarClan, a group of the spirits of the Clans' deceased ancestors who provide guidance to the living Clan cats, usually those of the Clan in which they resided in life. After death, the spirits of most Clan cats join StarClan. StarClan often provides guidance to the Clans through dreams and other signs like [[omen]]s, most often directed towards each Clan's medicine cats, part of whose role it is to commune with StarClan, in addition to providing medical care to their Clan. In addition to StarClan, there exists the Dark Forest, also known as The Place of No Stars, which takes the form of a never-ending forest. The spirits of cats who caused great pain and suffering to others while alive walk alone there as a form of punishment. Although cats of the Dark Forest are meant to be isolated as punishment, they eventually learn how to appear in the dreams of living cats much the way StarClan does.\n\nCats who live outside of the Clans are categorized into three groups. [[Housecats]], referred to as \"kittypets\" by Clan cats, are often looked down upon by the Clan cats for their cozy and lazy lifestyle. \"Loners\" are feral cats who live outside of the Clans, usually by themselves. They are often regarded by the Clans with suspicion. Similar to loners are \"rogues\", who differ in that they try to cause the Clan cats harm. It is rare, though not unheard of, for a kittypet, loner, or rogue to join a Clan, as outsiders are generally distrusted by Clan cats. In several instances, Clans that have taken in outsiders have been met with scorn by the other Clans.\n\nBeyond the Clans' territories lies a mountain range, inhabited by the Tribe of Rushing Water (often referred to simply as the Tribe), a group of cats who follow a different set of ancestors: the Tribe of Endless Hunting. The Tribe has a different hierarchical structure than the Clans, consisting of a Healer, cave-guards, and prey-hunters, who each serve a different function in the Tribe. The Healer leads the Tribe, heals the ill and wounded, and communicates with the Tribe of Endless Hunting; the cave-guards defend the Tribe and the prey-hunters hunt for the Tribe. In a subsequent prequel series, it is revealed that the Tribe was formed by the predecessors of the Clans when they left the [[lake]] territory to live in the mountains. In turn, cats from the Tribe later moved to the forest of the original series and formed the Clans.\n\n==Series==\n===''Warriors: The Prophecies Begin''===\n{{Main|Warriors (arc)}}\nThe original ''Warriors'' series, later re-titled ''Warriors: The Prophecies Begin'',<ref name=\"KateTwitter\"/> was released from 2003 to 2004 and consists of six books: ''[[Into the Wild (Warriors)|Into the Wild]]'' (21 January 2003), ''[[Fire and Ice (Warriors)|Fire and Ice]]'' (27 May 2003), ''[[Forest of Secrets (Warriors)|Forest of Secrets]]'' (14 October 2003), ''[[Rising Storm (Warriors)|Rising Storm]]'' (6 January 2004), ''[[A Dangerous Path (Warriors)|A Dangerous Path]]'' (1 June 2004), and ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]'' (5 October 2004).<ref name=\"ITWHarper\">{{cite web|title=Warriors #1: Into the Wild|publisher=HarperCollins|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/9780060000028/warriors-1-into-the-wild|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-2-Fire-Ice-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060000035|title=HarperCollins: Warriors #2: Fire and Ice by Erin Hunter(Hardcover)|accessdate=23 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021020154/http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-2-Fire-Ice-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060000035|archive-date=21 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-3-Forest-Secrets-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060000042|title=Warriors #3: Forest of Secrets by Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|accessdate=1 August 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021020820/http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-3-Forest-Secrets-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060000042|archive-date=21 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-4-Rising-Storm-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060000059|title=Warriors #4: Rising Storm by Erin Hunter (Hardcover)|publisher=HarperCollins|accessdate=8 August 2010|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/68wC5eTgl?url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-4-Rising-Storm-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060000059|archive-date=5 July 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-5-Dangerous-Path-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060000066|title=Warriors #5: A Dangerous Path by Erin Hunter (Hardcover)|publisher=HarperCollins|accessdate=9 August 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021053629/http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-5-Dangerous-Path-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060000066|archive-date=21 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-6-Darkest-Hour-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060000073|title=The Darkest Hour by Erin Hunter (Hardcover)|publisher=HarperCollins|accessdate=21 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021082009/http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-6-Darkest-Hour-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060000073|archive-date=21 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The series was subtitled ''The Prophecies Begin'' for its re-release with new covers in 2015.<ref name=\"KateTwitter\">{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/KatieThreeCats/status/517970484827549696|quote=The first Warriors series is finally to get its own name with its relaunch next year: \"The Prophecies Begin\".

To combat this, one cat from all four Clan\u2019s is chosen to journey and find a new home for the cats to live. These cats are Tawnypelt of ShadowClan, Crowpaw (later Crowfeather) of WindClan, Feathertail of RiverClan, and Brambleclaw of ThunderClan, the latter of whom also struggles with his heritage as the late Tigerstar\u2019s son. Feathertail\u2019s brother Stormfur and the ThunderClan apprentice Squirrelpaw (later Squirrelflight) also accompany them.\n\nThe first book, \"Midnight\" mainly revolves around the four chosen cats having their dream and leaving with Squirrelpaw/flight and Stormfur. Then, making a perilous journey and finding \"Midnight\", a wise badger. They then have to deliver a cryptic message from her which meant that the clans had to leave their home and that \"a dying warrior will show the way\". They decide to go over the mountains as it's safer than the route they took to get there.\n\nThe second book's main theme is the six getting through the mountains and getting home alive. They meet The Tribe Of Rushing Water who tries to keep Stormfur, believing him to be the cat who will save them from Sharptooth, a [[mountain lion]]. It turns out to be Feathertail who is the silver cat destined to save the tribe and she dies plunging a rock into its neck, killing it. It also says that Leafpaw/pool gets trapped by the Twolegs ([[humans]]), who don<nowiki>'t want cats getting in their way when they destroy the forest. It ends with Leafpaw/pool captured and the now five cats seeing their home. The middle books focus on a journey that all the clans go on together to get to their new home. The last two books mainly focus on a vision that \"Blood will spill blood and the lake will turn red\"</nowiki>.\n\n===''Warriors: Power of Three''===\n{{main|Warriors: Power of Three}}\nThe third series, ''Warriors: Power of Three'', was released from 2007 to 2009 and consists of six books: ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]'' (24 April 2007), ''[[Dark River (Warriors)|Dark River]]'' (26 December 2007), ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]'' (22 April 2008), ''[[Eclipse (Warriors)|Eclipse]]'' (2 September 2008), ''[[Long Shadows]]'' (25 November 2008), and ''[[Sunrise (novel)|Sunrise]]'' (21 April 2009).<ref name=\"DRHarper\">{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/9780060892050/warriors-power-of-three-2-dark-river|title=Warriors: Power of Three #2: Dark River|publisher=HarperCollins|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"OutcastHarper\">{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/9780060892081/warriors-power-of-three-3-outcast|title=Warriors: Power of Three #3: Outcast|publisher=HarperCollins|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/9780060892111/Warriors_Power_of_Three_4_Eclipse/index.aspx|publisher=HarperCollins|accessdate=10 August 2013|title=Warriors: Power of Three #4: Eclipse}}</ref><ref name=\"SunriseHarper\">{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/9780060892180/warriors-power-of-three-6-sunrise|title=Warriors: Power of Three #6: Sunrise|publisher=HarperCollins|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.ca/books/Warriors-Power-of-Three-5-Long-Shadows/?isbn=9780060892142 |title=Warriors: Power of Three #5: Long Shadows|work=HarperCollins|accessdate=10 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.ca/books/Warriors-Power-of-Three-1-The-Sight/?isbn=9780060892012|title=Warriors: Power of Three #1:The Sight|work=HarperCollins|accessdate=10 August 2013}}</ref> The plot is centered on the prophecy, ''\"There will be three, kin of your kin, who hold the power of the stars in their paws\"'', which was given to Firestar in ''[[Firestar's Quest]]'' by Skywatcher.<ref name=FQBook>{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Erin|title=Firestar's Quest|year=2007|url=http://www.harpercollinschildrens.com/Books/Firestars-Quest|publisher=HarperCollins}}</ref> The series revolves around Jayfeather, Hollyleaf, and Lionblaze, children of Brambleclaw and Squirrelflight, and grandchildren of the ThunderClan leader Firestar, who discover that they each have a unique power.

These relationships are not allowed for various reasons: some involve medicine cats, who are not allowed to have mates according to the medicine cat code, while others develop between cats in different Clans, which is also forbidden by the warrior code (for example, Graystripe of ThunderClan and Silverstream of RiverClan). Holmes said that another central theme of the series is \"faith and spirituality\" in StarClan.<ref name=fifthchat>{{cite web|title=Erin Hunter chat #5 transcript - August 16, 2008|url=http://wandsandworlds.com/community/node/5784|work=Wands and Worlds|accessdate=30 March 2013|date=16 August 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017050931/http://wandsandworlds.com/community/node/5784|archivedate=17 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  All books in the series feature the influence of StarClan, not just as the cats think of them, but in terms of prophecies delivered by StarClan which inevitably come true.  Some scenes take place within StarClan's realm, with no living cats present as point-of-view characters.  Thus the existence of an afterlife and the influence of spirits who have passed on and yet retain their earthly identities is integral to all of the plot arcs in the series. Another idea explored in the novels is the reactions of different faiths when meeting each other. For example, the Tribe of Rushing Water, which believes in different spiritual ancestors than the Clans, is introduced in ''Moonrise''. In an author chat, Holmes explained that the books never say that either of the Clans or the Tribe of Rushing Water is right about faith because both are \"equally valid.\" This leads to fear and suspicion between them because they are afraid of things they do not understand. Holmes said that \"ignorance is a very scary thing!\"<ref name=\"Second Chat\">{{cite web|title=Erin Hunter chat #2|url=http://wandsandworlds.com/community/node/124|work=Wands and Worlds |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010001755/http://wandsandworlds.com/community/node/124 |archivedate=10 October 2007}}</ref> Non-belief is also significant in the storylines: Mothwing and Cloudtail do not believe in StarClan.<ref name=\"Chat3part2\">{{cite web|url=http://wandsandworlds.com/community/node/882|title=Erin Hunter Chat No. 3 Transcript&nbsp;\u2014 part 2|work=Wands and Worlds|accessdate=2 March 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222012441/http://wandsandworlds.com/community/node/882|archivedate=22 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Kittypets, loners, and rouges were also a very important theme (at least for Erin Hunter).\n\nAnother theme is that characters can be a mix of good and evil. Holmes has said she is fascinated by these \"shades of gray\" in personalities. Her example of this was when Bluestar, a noble and honorable cat, gave up her kits for her own ambitions so an evil cat would not take over. Another example she gave of this is how the antagonist Tigerstar, even with all of his faults, is still courageous and fiercely loyal.<ref name=\"Nick\"/> Similarly, Holmes has also connected the theme to Brambleclaw and how nobody knew whether he was good or evil.<ref name=\"FourthChat\" /> A third major theme, often referred to as [[nature versus nurture]], explores whether a person is born the way he or she will be, or if other things shape that. For example, Brambleclaw's father is the evil Tigerstar, but he eventually demonstrates that despite this, he is not evil himself, despite initial suspicion from Clanmates due to his father's legacy. This theme ties into the \"shades of gray\" theme.<ref name=\"Second Chat\" /> similar to the book \u00a8Forest dogs\u00a8.\n\nA reviewer for ''Publishers Weekly'' noted that friendship and responsibility are taught to characters in the novels,<ref name=\"publishers-weekly\"/> while booksforyouths.com had a reviewer who pointed out the idea that, just as Clan cats shun house cats for their soft life, people should realize that it is necessary to experience hardship in life.<ref name=booksforyouths>{{cite web|url=http://booksforyouth.wordpress.com/2009/05/14/into-the-wild-warriors-book-1-by-erin-hunter/|title=booksforyouth Review|date=14 May 2009|publisher=booksforyouth.com|accessdate=20 July 2010}}</ref> A Storysnoops review noted that one of the themes was that \"it doesn't matter where you come from, only who you are inside\".<ref name=\"fireandicereview\">{{cite web|url=http://storysnoops.com/detail.php?id=248|title=Storysnoops Review|publisher=storysnoops.com|accessdate=23 July 2010}}</ref> In ''Dawn'', the importance of cooperation is explored.

The second of two plays by Erin Hunter, ''Brightspirit's Mercy'' is about Jaypaw, Lionblaze, and Hollyleaf. After going to a Gathering, where it is obvious all of the Clans except for ThunderClan are starving, three cats from StarClan appear to them: Brightspirit and her parents, Shiningheart and Braveheart, characters created on ''Wands and Worlds'', a fantasy fiction forum, in memory of a 10-year-old ''Warriors'' fan, Emmy Grace Cherry, and her parents, Dana and Jimmy Cherry, who were killed in a tornado in February 2007.<ref name=brightspirit>{{cite web|url=http://www.brightspiritrelieffund.com|title=Brightspirit Relief Fund|work=IMC studios}}</ref> They tell the three young cats that they must help feed the other Clans. Jaypaw is easily convinced, but Hollyleaf and Lionblaze are harder to win over. Eventually, they agree and hunt, then wait at the WindClan border for a patrol. Ashfoot, WindClan's deputy, accepts the gift, but Breezepaw, too proud to have help from another Clan, refuses to eat it. Jaypaw, Lionblaze, and Hollyleaf then head towards another Clan's territory.<ref name=\"secondplay\">{{cite web|url=http://www.warriorcats.com/data/downloads/brightspirit.pdf|title=''Brightspirit's Mercy''|last=Hunter|first=Erin|accessdate=7 June 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Physical media===\n{{anchor|Trading cards}}\n[[File:Warriors Trading Card.jpg|thumb|175px|Brambleclaw on a Chinese trading card.]]\n\nIn the Chinese translation of the series, \"3-D trading cards\" are packaged in each book.

[[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Al Gore]] were nominated for reelection. This was the first national convention of either party to be held in Chicago since the [[1968 Democratic National Convention#The Chicago police riot|disastrous riots]] of the 1968 Democratic convention, and as of 2016, the most recent presidential convention held in the city by either major party.\n\n==Site selection==\n[[File:United Center 060716.jpg|thumb|left|The [[United Center]] was the site of the 1996 Democratic National Convention]]\nChicago, [[Los Angeles]], [[New Orleans]], [[New York City|New York]], and [[San Antonio]] were originally considered as possible host cities.

The nomination speech was given by [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Christopher Dodd]] of [[Connecticut]]. Other notable speakers included former [[New York (state)|New York]] governor [[Mario Cuomo]], [[First Lady of the United States]] [[Hillary Clinton|Hillary Rodham Clinton]], actor [[Christopher Reeve]], [[Minority leader of the United States House of Representatives|House Minority Leader]] [[Dick Gephardt]], [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Minority Leader]] [[Tom Daschle]], and other Senators [[Russ Feingold]] of [[Wisconsin]], and [[John Kerry]] and [[Ted Kennedy]] of [[Massachusetts]].\n\n==Clinton's renomination speech==\n[[File:President Clinton's Remarks at the 1996 Democratic National Convention (1).jpg|thumb|Bill Clinton delivering his renomination speech]]\n[[File:1996 Democratic National Convention.jpg|thumb|President Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, Senator [[Paul Simon (politician)|Paul Simon]] and others on stage celebrating the renomination of Bill Clinton as the Democratic Party candidate for president]]\nClinton's speech on August 29 included his vision for the next decade, included tax cuts for the middle-class, 20 million more jobs, a strong defense with cuts in the military, but a strong presence of peacemaking troops, new military weapons and tanks, welfare reform goals for states and communities, and a peaceful transition for the Middle East.\n\n==Lyndon LaRouche==\n[[Lyndon LaRouche]] had run for president through multiple parties over multiple election cycles. In 1996, he ran for the nomination of the Democratic party, despite the Chair of the Democratic National Party ruling that Lyndon LaRouche \"is not to be considered a qualified candidate for nomination of the Democratic Party for President\" before the primaries began. In subsequent primaries LaRouche received enough votes in Louisiana and Virginia to get one delegate from each state. When the state parties refused to award the delegates, LaRouche sued in federal court, claiming a violation of the [[Voting Rights Act]]. After losing in the district court, the case was appealed to the First District Court of Appeals, which sustained the lower court.<ref>{{cite web|title=USA v.

He is best known for the glass and iron ''edicules'' or canopies, with ornamental Art Nouveau curves, which he designed to cover the entrances of the first stations of the [[Paris Metro]].<ref>Vigne, Georges, ''Hector Guimard - Le geste magnifique de l'Art Nouveau'', (2016), Editions du Patrimoine, Centre des Monuments National, p. 40 </ref> \n\nBetween 1890 and 1930, Guimard designed and built some fifty buildings, in addition to one hundred and forty-one subway entrances for [[Paris M\u00e9tro|Paris Metro]], as well as numerous pieces of furniture and other decorative works.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Hector Guimard|last=Graham|first=F.

His father, Germain-Ren\u00e9 Guimard, was an orthopedist, and his mother, Marie-Fran\u00e7oise Bailly, was a  linen maid. His parents married on 22 June 1867.  His father became a gymnastics teacher at the Lyc\u00e9e Michelet in [[Vanves]] in 1878, and the following year Hector began to study at the Lyc\u00e9e. In October 1882 he enrolled at the [[\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des arts d\u00e9coratifs]], or school of decorative arts. He received his diploma on 17 March 1887, and promptly enrolled in the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]], where he studied architecture, He received honorable mention in several architectural competitions, and also showed his paintings at the Paris Salon des Artistes in 1890, and in 1892 competed, without success, in the competition for the [[Prix de Rome]].   In October 1891 he began to \nteach drawing and perspective to young women at the \u00c9cole nationale des arts decoratifs  and later a course on perspective for younger students, a post he held until July 1900. <ref>Vgne, Georges, ''Hector Guimard - Le Geste Magnifique de l'Art Nouveau'' (2016), pp. 197</ref>\n\nHe showed his work at the Paris Salons of April 1894 and 1895, which earned him a prize of a funded voyage first to England and Scotland, and then, in the summer of 1895, to the Netherlands and Belgium.  In Brussels in the summer of 1895 he met the Belgian architect [[Victor Horta]], one of the founders of [[Art Nouveau]], and saw the sinuous vegetal and floral lines of the [[Hotel Tassel]], one of the earliest Art Nouveau houses.  Guimard arranged for Horta to have an exhibition of his designs at the January 1896 Paris Salon, and Guimard's own style and career began to change.{{Sfn|Vigne (2016)|page=197}}\n\n== Early career (1888\u20131898) ==\n=== Early works ===\nThe earliest constructed work of Guimard was the cafe-restaurant ''Au Grand Neptune'' (1888)<ref name=\"theartstory\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theartstory.org/artist/guimard-hector/life-and-legacy/#biography_header|title=Hector Guimard - Life and Legacy|website=theartstory.org|accessdate=17 February 2020}}</ref>, located on the Quai Auteuil in Paris at the edge of the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Paris Universal Exposition of 1889]].  It was picturesque but not strikingly innovative. It was demoilished in 1910. He constructed another picturesque structure for the Exposition, the Pavilion of Electricity, a showcase for the work of electrical engineer Ferdinand de Boy\u00e9res. Between 1889 and 1895 he constructed a dozen apartment buildings, villas and houses, mostly in the Paris 16th arrondissement or suburbs,  including the Hotel Rosz\u00e9 (1891) and the Hotel Jassed\u00e9 (1893) without attracting much attention. He earned his living primarily from his teaching at the School of Decorative Arts.{{Sfn|Vigne (2016)|page=188}}\n\n=== The Castel B\u00e9ranger (1895-1898) ===\nGuimard's first recognized major work was the [[Castel B\u00e9ranger]] in Paris, an apartment building with thirty-six units constructed between 1895 and 1898, when the architect was just thirty years old.  at 14, rue Jean de la Fontaine, Paris, for Mme. Fournier. He persuaded his client to abandon a more restrained design and replace it with a new design in a more modern style, similar to that of Horta's [[Hotel Tassel]], which he had visited in the summer of 1895.{{Sfn|Vigne (2016)|page=197}} Guimard put together an extraordinary number of stylistic effects and theatrical elements on the facade and in the interior, using cast iron, glass and ceramics for decoration. The lobby, decorated with sinuous vine-like cast iron and colorful ceramics, resembled an undersea grotto. He designed every detail, including the wallpaper, rain spouts and door handles, and added adding highly modern new features including a telephone booth in the lobby.{{Sfn|Vigne (2016)|Page=40-45}}.  \n\nA skilled publicist, Guimard very effectively used the new building to advertise his work.  He had his own apartment and office in the building. He organized conferences and press articles, set up an exhibition of his drawings in the salons of ''Le Figaro'', and wrote a monograph on the building. In 1899 He entered it into the first Paris competition for the best new  building facades, and in March 1899 it was selected one of the six winners, a fact which he proudly had inscribed on the facade of the building.{{Sfn|Vigne (2016)|Page=40-45}} \n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Paris 16 - Castel B\u00e9ranger -1.JPG|Facade of the Castel B\u00e9ranger\nFile:Castel B\u00e9ranger, February 16, 2013.jpg|Gateway\nFile:Le hall dentr\u00e9e du Castel B\u00e9ranger (Hector Guimard) (5479354274).jpg|Entrance hall\nFile:Paris 16 - Castel B\u00e9ranger -10.JPG|Balcony decoration\nFile:Un des hippocampes du Castel B\u00e9ranger (Paris) (4818198698).jpg|Exterior decoration\nFile:Le Vesinet villa Berthe La Hublotiere Hector Guimard.jpg|Villa Berthe (1896)\n</gallery>\n\n== Mature career (1898\u20131914) ==\n=== Castels, Villas and a short-lived Concert Hall ===\nThe success and publicity created by the Castel Beranger quickly brought him commissions for other residential buildings. Between 1898 and 1900 he constructed three houses simultaneously, each very different but recognizably in Guimard's style. The first, the [[Maison Coilliot]], was built for the ceramics manufacturer Louis Coilliot on rue de Fleurs in [[Lille]], and served as his store, reception hall and residence. The facade was covered with plaques of green enamelled volcanic rock, and decorated with soaring arches, curling wrought iron, and Guimard's characteristic asymmetric, organic doorways and windows.{{Sfn|Vigne (2016)|pages=66-83}}\n\nThe following year, 1899, while he continued to teach regularly at the school of decorative arts in Paris, and continued construction of the Maison Coilliot, he began three new houses;  The Modern Castel or Villa Canivet in [[Garches]] was Guimard's reinvention of a medieval castle. [[La Bluette]] in  [[Hermanville-sur-Mer]] was Guimard's update of traditional  Norman architecture. and the [[Castel Henriette]], in Sevres. The Castel Henriette was the most inventive.  It was located on a small site, almost circular, and was crowned with a tall, slender watchtower.  To create more open interior space, Guimard moved the stairwell to the side of the building.  The interior wss lit by large windows, and featured ensembles of furniture all designed by Guimard.  The building had an unhappy history.  The watchtower fell in 1903, apparently after being struck by lightning. Guimard was summoned back and redesigned the house, adding new balconies and terrace. However, by the 1960s, the building was considered out of fashion, and it was rarely occupied. It served as a movie set before it was finally demolished, despite appeals by preservationists. Some of the furniture is now found in museums.{{Sfn|Vigne (2016)|pages=66-83}} \n\nIn 1898 Guimard embarked upon another ambitious project, the construction of a concert hall, the Salle Humbert-de-Romans, located at 60 Rue Saint Didier (16th arrondissement). It was  built as the centrepiece of a conservatory of Christian music intended for orphans, proposed by a Dominican monk, Father Levy. Guimard made an ambitious and non-traditional plan using soaring levels of iron and glass, inspired by an early idea of [[Eugene Viollet-le-Duc]]. An organ manufacturer, in consultation with [[Camille Saint-Saens]], donated a grand organ.   The Salle was completed in 1901, but a scandal involving Father Levy and the orphans broke out. Father Levy was exiled by the Pope to Constantinople, the foundation was dissolved, and the concert hall was used only for meetings and conferences.  It closed in 1904 and was demolished in 1905. The grand organ moved to the church of Saint-Vincent-de-Pual in Clichy, where it can be found today.{{Sfn|Vigne (2016)|page=190}}<ref>Fernand Mazade, \u00ab\u00a0An \"Art Nouveau\" Edifice in Paris, The Architectural Record, vol. 12, no\u00a01, May  1902, p.\u00a051-66 (consultable on  archive.org)</ref>  \n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Lille maison coilliot ass.jpg|The [[Maison Coilliot]] in [[Lille]] (1898-1900)\nFile:Hermanville bluette digue.jpg|Villa [[La Bluette]] in Hermanville-sur-Mer, Calvados (1899-1900)\nFile:Castel Henriette Guimard No. 13.jpg|[[Castel Henriette]], [[Sevres]] (1899-1900)\nFile:Henriette1914.jpg|Castel Henriette after the removal of the watchtower \nFile:Salle Humbert de Romans (ext\u00e9rieur).jpg|The Salle Humbert-de-Romans (1898-1901)\nFile:Salle Humbert-de-Romans.jpg|Colored postcard of the interior of the Salle-Humbert-de-Romans\n</gallery>\n\n=== Paris Metro entrances ===\n{{main|Paris M\u00e9tro entrances by Hector Guimard}}\nThe highly-publicized debut of the Hotel B\u00e9ranger quickly brought Horta new projects, including villas, a Paris concert hall, and, most famously, entrances for the stations of the new [[Paris Metro]], which was planned to open in 1900 in time for the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Paris Universal Exposition]].  A new organization, the chemin de fer m\u00e9tropolitan de Paris (CFP, now RATP) was created in April 1899 to build and manage the system. They organized a competition for station entrance edicules, or canopies, and balustrades, or railings.  This attracted twenty-one applicants. Guimard did not apply. The twenty-one original applicants proposed edicules built of masonry, in various historic and picturesque styles. These were ridiculed in the press as resembling newspaper stands, funeral monuments, or public toilets. Time was short, and Guimard presented sketches of his own idea for entrances made of iron and glass, which would be quicker and simpler to manufacture. He was given the commission on 12 January 1900, just a few months before the opening of the system.{{Sfn|Vigne (2016)|pages=85-103}}\n\nTo simplify the manufacture, Guimard made two designs of edicules, called Type A and B. Both were made of cast iron frames, with cream-colored walls and glass roofs to protect against rain. The A type was simpler and more cubic, while the B was rounded and more dynamic in form, and is sometimes compared with a [[dragonfly]].  Only two of the original A types were made and neither still exists. Only one B type, restored, remains in its original location, at [[Porte Dauphine]].{{Sfn|Vigne (2016)|pages=88-89}}\n\nGuimard also designed a simpler version, without a roof, with railings or balustrades of ornamental green-painted iron escutcheons and two high pylons with lamps and a 'M\u00e9tropolitain' sign.   The pylons were in an abstract vegetal form he invented, not resembling any particular plant, and the lettering was in a unique which Guimard invented. These were the most common type.{{Sfn|Vigne (2016)|pages=88-89}}\n\nFrom the beginning, Guimard's Metro entrances were controversial.  In 1904, after complaints that the new Guimard balustrade  at the Opera station was not in harmony with the architecture of the [[Palais Garnier]] opera house, the Metro authorities dismantled the entrance and replaced it with a more classical model.   Garnier was sarcastic in his response in the Paris ''La Press'' of Paris on October 4, 1904.  \"Should we harmonise the station of P\u00e8re-Lachaise with the cemetery by constructing an entrance in the form of a tomb?...Should we have a dancer with her leg raised in front of the station at place Dame-Blanche, to harmonise with the Moulin-Rouge?\"{{Sfn|Vigne (2016)|pages=88-89}}\n\nFrom the beginning, Guimard was also in conflict with the Metro authorities about his payments. The dispute was ended in 1903 with an agreement by which Guimard received payment, but gave up his models and manufacturing rights. Construction of new stations continued using his design without his participation. Between 1900 and 1913,<ref name=Graham>F.

His works shown at the 1903 Paris Exposition of residential architecture did not attract the attention of the Castel Beranger and other earlier work.  He was supported largely by one wealthy client, L\u00e9on Nozal, and his friends. His works for this group included the La Sapiniere, a small beach house at [[Hermanville-sur-Mer]], near his earlier La Bluette house; La Surprise, a villa at Cabourg; and the Castel Val at [[Auvers-sur-Oise]].  In Paris he constructed the Hotel Nozal on Rue Ranelagh for his friend; the Hotel Jassad\u00e9 for Louis Jassad\u00e9 on Avenue de Versailles; and the palatial Castel d'Orgeval, which was the centrepiece of a new residential development at [[Villemoisson-sur-Orge]] in the Paris suburbs.{{Sfn|Vigne (2016)|page=126}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Photograph, Exterior of Castel d'Orgeval, Overview of Main Facade, 1904 (CH 18449503).jpg|Drawing of the Castel d'Orgeval by Guimard (1904)\nFile:Hector Guimard - Rear Facade, Castel d'Orgeval, Parc Beaus\u00e9jour, near Paris- Elevation - Google Art Project.jpg|Plan of the Castel d'Orgeval drawn by Guimard (1904)\nFile:1900Sapi0015.jpg|La Sapini\u00e8re (1907) around the time of its completion (today considerably modified from Guimard's original design)\n</gallery>\n\n=== The H\u00f4tel Guimard ===\nThe most important work of this period is the [[H\u00f4tel Guimard (Art Nouveau)|Hotel Guimard]],  built in 1909 at 122 Avenue Mozart (XVIth arrondissement) in Paris, ten years after his first success with the Hotel Beranger. It was built following his marriage on with [[Adeline Oppenheim]], an American painter from a wealthy family.  The land was purchased three months after the marriage, and in June 1910 Guimard was able to move the offices of his agency into the ground floor.  The house was not occupied by the couple, however, for two more years, while the furniture he designed was manufactured.  The house is located on a triangular lot, which proved a particularly challenge for Guimard.  He saved interior space by installing an inclined elevator rather than a stairway on the upper floors.  The house was designed to show its functions on the facade;  his wife could paint in one portion of the house, with large windows, while he worked in his bureau in another part of the house.  It had a very large dining room and many tables, but no kitchen; it was apparently designed for working and entertaining.  The house was later broken up into apartments, and the original room arrangements and furniture are gone.{{Sfn|Vigne (2016)|page=126-127}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Adeline and Hector Guimard.jpg|thumb|Hector Guimard with his wife Adeline, around 1910\nFile:H\u00f4tel Guimard 2019.jpg|Facade of the H\u00f4tel Guimard.

Between 1910 and 1911 he built H\u00f4tel Mezzara for Paul Mezzara, experimenting with skylights. Another notable work of this period is the [[Agoudas Hakehilos Synagogue]] at 10 Rue Pav\u00e9 (IV arrondissement) in the [[Marais district]]. The synagogue, Guimard's only religious building, is characterised by a narrow fa\u00e7ade clad in white stone, whose surface curves and undulates while highlighting verticality. Like with his previous projects, Guimard designed the interiors as well, organising the spaces and creating original furnishings that matched the architectural motifs of the structure. The construction begun in 1913 with the inauguration taking place on June 7, 1914, just a few weeks before the beginning of the First World War. \n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Guimard-16eme-artnouveau-11-rue-millet.jpg|Apartment building \"Tr\u00e9mois\", Rue Millet, Paris XVI arrondissement  (1909)\nFile:Guimard-16eme-artnouveau-rue-agar-detail2.jpg|Detail of the Rue Agar (then Rue Moderne) apartments (1910-1912).\nFile:D\u00e9cor dun immeuble art nouveau dHector Guimard \u00e0 Paris (4818961578).jpg|Detail of windows from the Rue de la Fontain apartments (1911).\nFile:Paris 16 - H\u00f4tel Mezzara -1.JPG|H\u00f4tel Mezzara (1910-1911), exterior view.\nFile:Hotel mezzara 2343.jpg|The interiors of the H\u00f4tel Mezzara, with Art Nouveau stairway and glass roof.\nFile:Guimard-4eme-artnouveau-10-rue-pavee-synagogue.jpg|[[Agoudas Hakehilos Synagogue]] rue Pav\u00e9e, Paris, 1913\nFile:Synagogue rue pav\u00e9e Paris02.jpg|Decoration of entrance of the [[Agoudas Hakehilos Synagogue]]\nFile:Paris Synagogue RuePav\u00e9e innen399.JPG|Interior of the [[Agoudas Hakehilos Synagogue]]\n</gallery>\n\n== Late career (1914\u20131942) ==\n=== World War I and post-war years ===\nBy the time the [[First World War]] began in August 1914, [[Art Nouveau]] was already out of fashion.  The army and war economy took almost all available workers and building materials.  Most of Guimard's projects were shelved. and Guimard gave up his furniture workshop on Avenue Perrichont. He left Paris and to reside most of the war in a luxury hotel in [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]] and [[Candes-Saint-Martin]], where he wrote essays and pamphlets calling for an end to militarized society, and also, more practically, studying ideas standardized housing that could be constructed more quickly and less expensively, anticipating the need to reconstruct housing destroyed in the War. He received a dozen patents for his new inventions.{{Sfn|Vigne (2016|page=171}}<ref name=\"vigneferre\">{{cite book |last1=Vigne |first1=Georges |last2=Felipe |first2=Ferr\u00e9|date=2003 |title=Hector Guimard |url= |location= |publisher=Charles Moreau |page= |isbn= |author-link= |language=French}}</ref> \n\nOne of the rare completed buildings still standing from this period is the office building at 10 Rue de Bretagne, begun in 1914 but not completed until after the War in 1919.{{Sfn|Vigne (2016|page=192}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lecercleguimard.fr/fr/hector-guimard-architecte/loeuvre-de-guimard/oeuvre-batie-hector-guimard/|title=Le Cercle Guimard - L'\u0153uvre b\u00e2ti|website=lecercleguimard.fr|accessdate=16 February 2020|language=French}}</ref>  The Art Nouveau style was replaced by a more functional simplicity, where the reinforced concrete structure defined the exterior of the building.  The postwar shortages of iron and other materials affected the style; there was little decoration of the facade, or entrance.

He returned to Paris and in 1921-22, and built a small house at 3 Square Jasmin (16th arrondissement) designed to be a model for a series of standard houses, but it was not duplicated.  He was  unable to keep up with the rapid changes in styles and methods, and His firm was finally dissolved in July 1925.{{Sfn|Vigne (2016)| page=198}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Photograph, Photograph of the Construction of a Mass-operational House Designed by Hector Guimard (No. 21), 1921 (CH 18387463).jpg|Model fa\u00e7ade of the mass-produced house (1921)\nFile:Photograph, Photograph of the Construction of a Mass-operational House Designed by Hector Guimard (No. 14), 1921 (CH 18387447).jpg|Cast pieces to be assembled for the mass-produced house\nFile:Drawing, Design for a Mass-Operational House Designed by Hector Guimard, Wall Construction, October 1920 (CH 18410953).jpg|Instructions for the construction of the mass-produced house, drawing by Guimard (October 1920)\n</gallery>\n\n\nIn 1925 he participated in the Paris Exposition of Decorative and Modern Arts,  the Exposition which gave its name to [[Art Deco]], with a proposed model of a town  hall for a French village.  He also designed and built a parking garage and several war memorials and funeral monuments.   He continued to receive honors, particularly for his teaching at the \u00c9cole national des arts decoratifs. In February 1929 he was named a Chevalier in the French [[Legion d'honneur]].{{Sfn|Vigne (2016)| page=198}}\n\nAfter the war, [[Art Deco]] emerged as the leading style of Parisian architecture. Guimard adapted to the new style and proved his originality and attention to the detail. His buildings display geometric decorative patterns, simplified columns emphasizing structural elements and rigid shapes; despite this they retain elements of his previous style: sinuous lines, vegetal-inspired ornaments and typical Art Nouveau iron railings.<ref name=\"vigneferre\"/>\n\n===The Guimard Building and final works ===\nHis next project, the Guimard Building, an apartment building at 18 Rue Henri Heine, Paris (XVI arrondissement, begun in 1926. is his last major project still standing.    He made a skilful of different-colored brick and stone to create decorative designs on the facade, and added triangular sculpted windows on the roof level, and, in the interior. a very remarkable central stairway with curling iron railings and hexagonal windows of colored and clear glass bricks  In 1928 he entered the building into the competition for the best Paris facades, the same competition that he had entered in 1898 with the H\u00f4tel Beranger. He was a winner again, and was the first Paris architect to enter twice and to win twice.  This building became his residence, though he was not able to move in until 1930.  {{Sfn|Vigne (2016)|page=129}}. \n\nDespite his success with the facade competition, his late work appeared old fashioned, particularly compared with the modernism of the Paris buildings of [[Robert Mallet-Stevens]], [[August Perret]], and [[Le Corbusier]].   Between 1926 and 1930 he built several residential buildings in the same neighborhood as his home in the 16th arrondissement, which still exist. These include the H\u00f4tel Houyvet, at 2 Villa Flore and 120 Avenue Mozart, built for the industrialist Michel Antoine Paul Houyhvet. His last recorded work was La Guimardi\u00e8re, an apartment building on Avenue Le N\u00f4tre, Vaucresson in the [[Hauts-de-Seine]] suburb of Paris. It was completed in about 1930, but was demolished in March-April 1969.{{Sfn|Vigne (2016)| page=198}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Rue Henri Heine 18.jpg|THe Guimard Building at Rue Henri-Heine, Paris XVI arrondissement (1926).\nFile:Rue Henri Heine 18 porte.jpg|Detail of the Guimard Building,  showing the entrance, where Art Deco and Art Nouveau elements coexist.\nFile:Rue Greuze 36-38 Guimard 1926-1929.jpg|Apartmet building,  Rue Greuze (28), (Paris XVI arrondissement) \n</gallery>\n\nAs early as 1918 he took steps to assure that his work would be documented and would survive. He obtained space in the former orangerie of the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], where he deposited models of his buildings and hundreds of designs. In 1936 he donated a large collection of his designs to [[Alfred Barr]], the director of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York. In 1937 he received authorisation to put thirty cases of models in the cellars of the National Museum of Antiquities in Saint-Germaine-en-Laye.{{Sfn|Vigne (2016) page=198}}\n\nGuimard served as a member of the jury judging architectural works at the [[1937 Paris Exposition]],  where he could hardly miss the monumental pavilion of Nazi Germany and the threat it presented. His wife was Jewish, and he was alarmed by the approaching likelihood of war. In September, 1938, he and his wife settled in New York City.  He died on May 20, 1942 at the [[1049 Fifth Avenue|Hotel Adams]] on Fifth Avenue. He is buried in [[Gate of Heaven Cemetery (Hawthorne, New York)|Gate of Heaven Cemetery]] in Hawthorne, New York, about 25 miles north of New York City.{{Sfn|Vigne (2016)|page=198}}\n\n==Obscurity and Rediscovery ==\nAfter the War, in June-July 1948, his widow returned to Paris to settle his affairs. She offered the Hotel Guimard as a site for a Guimard Museum first to the French state, then to the City of Paris, but both refused.  Instead, she donated three rooms of Guimard's furniture to three museums;  the [[Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon]], the [[Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs, Paris|Museum of Decorative Arts]] in Paris, and the Museum of the [[Petit Palais]], where they are now displayed. She also donated a collection of three hundred designs and photographs to the Museum of Decorative Arts  These disappeared into various archives  the 1960s, but were relocated in 2015. His widow died on 26 October 1965 in New York.<ref name=academiaPDF>{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/36208314|title=Adeline Oppenheim Guimard 1872-1965 artiste et m\u00e9c\u00e8ne|website=www.academia.edu|accessdate=12 February 2020|language=French}}</ref> {{Sfn|Vigne (2016)|page=198}}\n\nBy the time of Guimard's death, many of his buildings had already been demolished or remodeled beyond recognition. Most of his original Metro station edicules and balustrades had also been removed. The only full covering remaining at its original location at [[Porte Dauphine (Paris Metro)|Porte Dauphine]].  However, many  original architectural drawings by Guimard were  stored in the Dept. of Drawings & Archives at [[Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library]] at [[Columbia University]] in New York City, and in the archives of the Museum of Decorative Arts in Paris.  {{Sfn|Vigne (2016) page=198}}\n\nThe re-evaluation and rehabilitation of Guimard's reputation began in the late 1960s.  Portions of the [[Castel Beranger]] were declared of historic and artistic value in July 1965, and the entire building was protected in 1989.{{Sfn|Vigne (2016)|page=189}} His reputation  was given a major boost in 1970, when the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York hosted a large exhibition of his work, including drawings he had donated himself and one of his Metro Station edicules. Other museums followed.  The thirty cases of models in the cellars of the National Museum of Antiquities in Saint-Germaine-en-Laye were rediscovered and some were put on display.\n\nIn 1978 all of Guimard's surviving Metro entrances (Eighty-eight of the original one hundred sixty-seven put in place) were declared of historic value. The city donated a few originals, and several copies, to Chicago and other cities which desired them. Reconstructed original edicules are found at [[Abbesses (Paris Metro)|Abbesses]] and [[Ch\u00e2telet (Paris Metro)|Ch\u00e2telet]]. {{Sfn|Vigne (2016)|page=191}}.  \n\nMany of his buildings have been substantially modified, and there are no intact Guimard interiors which are open to the  public, though suites of his furniture can be found in the Museum of Decorative Arts and the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in Paris.\n\n== Furniture ==\nLike other prominent Art Nouveau architects, Guimard also designed furniture and other interior decoration to harmonize with his buildings.  It took him some time to find his own style in furniture. The furniture he designed for the Hotel Delfau (1894), which he put on display at an Exposition in 1895, was picturesque and ornate, with a sort of star motif, which seemed to have little connection with the architecture of the house. His early furniture sometimes featured had long looping arms  and lateral shelves and levels for displays of objects. He apparently did not produce any furniture for the Hotel Beranger, other than a desk and chairs for his own studio there.  In his early years he is known to have produced only two full sets of furniture, a dining room set for the Castel Henriette and a dining room for the Villa La Bluette.He also designed furnishings without any particular room in mind, as he did with watercolor designs for the Russian Princess Maria Tenisheva in 1903.{{Sfn|Vigne (2016)|page=151-152}}\n\nHis furniture style began to change in about 1903.  He found a workshop to make his furniture, and began using finer woods, particularly pear wood, with delicate colors. He simplified he plans, and eliminated the excessive number of arms and shelves. The most notable examples of his late style are pieces made for the H\u00f4tel Nozal (since destroyed) and now in the [[Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs, Paris|Mus\u00e9e des Arts Decoratifs]] in Paris.  Other examples of the late style are from the [[Hotel Guimard]], now in the [[Petit Palais]] and the [[Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs, Paris|Mus\u00e9e des Arts Decoratifs]] in Paris, and [[Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Lyon]].{{Sfn|Vigne (2016)|page=151-152}}   \n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\n\nFile:Hector guimard, divano da fumoir, dalla sala da biliardo della casa del farmacista albert roy a g\u00e9vrils, 1897-98.JPG|Divan for the billiards room of pharmacist Albert Roy at G\u00e9vriles (1897-90) ([[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]], Paris)\nFile:Buffet, Hector Guimard, Paris, 1899-1900, cherry, brass, glass - Br\u00f6han Museum, Berlin - DSC03965.JPG|Buffet of cherry wood, brass, and glass (1899-1900) ([[Br\u00f6han Museum]], Berlin)\nFile:Chair, Hector Guimard, Paris, c. 1900, pear wood, leather - Br\u00f6han Museum, Berlin - DSC03968.JPG|Side chair of pear wood and leather (1900) ([[Br\u00f6han Museum]], Berlin)\nFile:Guimard-Armoire.jpg|Armoire, H\u00f4tel Nozal (1904-1906)\nFile:Hector Guimard (Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Lyon) (11251879956).jpg|Furnishings for the bedroom of Madame Guimard, H\u00f4tel Guimard (1909-12) ([[Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Lyon]])\nFile:Petit Palais - Salle \u00e0 manger Maison Guimard - 002.jpg|Dining room in the [[Hotel Guimard]] ([[Petit Palais]], Paris)\nFile:D\u00e9tail de la coiffeuse de la chambre de Madame Guimard, 1909-1912.jpg|Dressing table from bedroom of Madame Guimard (1909-1912)\n</gallery>\n\n==The Guimard Style==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:01 Guimard's M\u00e9tropolitain.jpg|Typeface Guimard invented for his Metro edicules (1900) \nFile:A7-01423.jpg|Design on wall panel of ''\u00e9dicule'', [[Porte Dauphine (Paris M\u00e9tro)|Porte Dauphine]] \nFile:MBAM Guimard - Grille d'une entr\u00e9e de m\u00e9tro de Paris.jpg|Guimard Metro balustrade plaque (1900)\nFile:Plaque numero guimard 2 75016.JPG|House number plaque at Castel Beranger\nFile:Balcon de lh\u00f4tel Guimard (Paris) (4818661086).jpg|Balcony railing from the [[H\u00f4tel Guimard (Art Nouveau)|Hotel Guimard]]\nFile:Hector Guimard (Mus\u00e9e Br\u00f6han, Berlin) (6324594589).jpg|Guimard doorknobs (Mus\u00e9e Br\u00f6han, Berlin)\nFile:Vase Hector Guimard 1899 Br\u00f6han Museum Berlin 21042018 1.jpg|Porcelain vase (1899), {Mus\u00e9e Br\u00f6han, Berlin)\nFile:Hector guimard, fioriera con manici, 1900.JPG|Guimard flower vase (1900) (Mus\u00e9e D'Orsay)\nFile:Curtain MET TP420.jpg|Guimard window curtain (Metropoliotan Museum) \nFile:Collections du Mus\u00e9e national de c\u00e9ramique de S\u00e8vres 03.jpg|Vase of Binelles (1902), S\u00e8vres porcelain, crystallization on hard porcelain, (National Museum of Ceramics in S\u00e8vres, France) \n</gallery>\t\nMuch of the success of Guimard came from the small details of his designs, from door handles and balcony railings to type faces, which he crafted with special imagination and care. He invented his own style of lettering  which appeared on his Metro entrances and his building plans.   He insisted on calling his work \"Style Guimard\", not Art Nouveau, and he was genius at publicizing it.  He wrote numerous articles and gave interviews and lectures on his work, and printed a set of  \"Style Guimard\" postcards with his pictures of his buildings, {{Sfn|Vigne (2016|page=106-109}}\n \nGuimard rejected the dominant academic [[Beaux-Arts style]]  of there 1880s, calling it  \"cold receptacle of various past styles in which the original spirit was no longer alive enough to dwell\"<ref name=\":0\" />.

In 1885 he received awards in all of the competitions at the school, including four bronze medallions, five silver, and the school's Grande Prix d'Architecture.\n \t\nGuimard's early Art Nouveau work, particularly the [[Castel Beranger]], as Guimard himself acknowledged, was strongly influenced by the work of the Belgian architect [[Victor Horta]], especially the [[Hotel Tassel]], which Guimard visited before he designed the Castel Beranger.  Like Horta, he created original designs and ornament, inspired by his own views of nature. If the skylights favored by [[Victor Horta]] are rare in his work (the Mezzara Hotel, 1910, and the [[Agoudas Hakehilos Synagogue|Rue Pav\u00e9e Synagogue]], (1913), being notable exceptions), Guimard made noteworthy experiments in space and volume.

A notable example is the Vase of Binelles (1902), made by crystallization on hard porcelain, It is now in the National Museum of Ceramics in S\u00e8vres. \n\nGuimard was a determined advocate of architectural standardization, from mass-producing Metro station edicules and balustrades to (less successfully) the mass production of cast iron pieces and other prefabricated building materials intended for the assembly rows of houses.

But neither is it merely withered and graceless floral or animal skeletons that Mr. Guimard draws. He is inspired by the underlying movements, by the creative process in nature that reveals to us identical formulas through its numerous manifestations. And he assimilates these principles in the formation of his ornamental contours... the floret is not an exact representation of any particular flower, Here is an art that both abbreviates and amplifies the immediate facts of Nature; it spiritualises them. We are present at the birth of the quintessence of a flower.\"<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>\n\n==Chronology of notable buildings==\n[[File:Paris 16 - Castel B\u00e9ranger -1.JPG|thumb|right|100px|[[Castel Beranger]] (completed 1898)]]\n[[File:Lille maison coilliot ass.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Maison Coilliot]] (1898)]]\n[[File:Castel Henriette Guimard No. 13.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Castel Henriette]] (1898)]]\n[[File:Abbesses entrance 2.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Abbesses (Paris M\u00e9tro)]] (1900)]]\n[[File:Paris 16 - Immeuble Jass\u00e9d\u00e9 142 avenue de Versailles -1.JPG|thumb|right|100px|Immeuble Jass\u00e9d\u00e9 (1903-1905)]]\n[[File:Guimard-16eme-artnouveau-11-rue-millet-face.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Immeuble Tremois (1909)]] \n[[File:Photograph, Exterior View of the House of Hector Guimard, ca. 1910 (CH 18411087-2).jpg|thumb|right|100px|H\u00f4tel Guimard (1909)]]\n[[File:Paris-Marais-Synagoge-102-2017-gje.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Synagogue de la rue Pav\u00e9e \u00e0 Paris]] (1913)]]\n\n==== 1889: ====\n*Caf\u00e9 Au grand Neptune, quai Louis-Bl\u00e9riot, Paris XVI (destroyed about 1910):\n*Pavillion d'Electricit\u00e9 at the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)]], avenue Suffren, Pais (destroyed 1889):\n==== 1891: ====\n* H\u00f4tel Rosz\u00e9, 34 rue Boileau, Paris, 16th arrondissement\n* Two pavilions for Alphonse-Marie Hannequin, 145 Avenue de Versailles, Paris XVI  (destroyed 1926)\n==== 1892: ====\n* Villa Toucy, 189 rue du Vieux-Pont-de-Sevres, Billancourt (destroyed 1912-13)\n* Maisons jumelles L\u00e9colle\n* Pavillon de chasse Rose, 14 et 14ter, rue des Tilleuls, Limeil-Br\u00e9vannes, Val-de-Marne (d\u00e9truit vers 1960)\n==== 1893: ====\n* H\u00f4tel Jassed\u00e9, 41 rue Chardon-Lagache (protected)\n==== 1894: ====\n* H\u00f4tel Delfau, 1 rue Molitor, Paris XVI (modified)\n==== 1895: ====\n* \u00c9cole du Sacr\u00e9-Coeur, 9 Avenue de la Frilli\u00e9re, Paris XVI.

He achieved early fame with his design for the [[Castel Beranger]], the first Art Nouveau apartment building in Paris, which was selected in an 1899 competition as one of the best new building facades in the city. He is best known for the glass and iron ''edicules'' or canopies, with ornamental Art Nouveau curves, which he designed to cover the entrances of the first stations of the [[Paris Metro]].<ref>Vigne, Georges, ''Hector Guimard - Le geste magnifique de l'Art Nouveau'', (2016), Editions du Patrimoine, Centre des Monuments National, p. 40 </ref> \n\nBetween 1890 and 1930, Guimard designed and built some fifty buildings, in addition to one hundred and forty-one subway entrances for [[Paris M\u00e9tro|Paris Metro]], as well as numerous pieces of furniture and other decorative works.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Hector Guimard|last=Graham|first=F.

His father, Germain-Ren\u00e9 Guimard, was an orthopedist, and his mother, Marie-Fran\u00e7oise Bailly, was a  linen maid. His parents married on 22 June 1867.  His father became a gymnastics teacher at the Lyc\u00e9e Michelet in [[Vanves]] in 1878, and the following year Hector began to study at the Lyc\u00e9e. In October 1882 he enrolled at the [[\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des arts d\u00e9coratifs]], or school of decorative arts. He received his diploma on 17 March 1887, and promptly enrolled in the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]], where he studied architecture, He received honorable mention in several architectural competitions, and also showed his paintings at the Paris Salon des Artistes in 1890, and in 1892 competed, without success, in the competition for the [[Prix de Rome]].   In October 1891 he began to \nteach drawing and perspective to young women at the \u00c9cole nationale des arts decoratifs  and later a course on perspective for younger students, a post he held until July 1900. <ref>Vgne, Georges, ''Hector Guimard - Le Geste Magnifique de l'Art Nouveau'' (2016), pp. 197</ref>\n\nHe showed his work at the Paris Salons of April 1894 and 1895, which earned him a prize of a funded voyage first to England and Scotland, and then, in the summer of 1895, to the Netherlands and Belgium.  In Brussels in the summer of 1895 he met the Belgian architect [[Victor Horta]], one of the founders of [[Art Nouveau]], and saw the sinuous vegetal and floral lines of the [[Hotel Tassel]], one of the earliest Art Nouveau houses.  Guimard arranged for Horta to have an exhibition of his designs at the January 1896 Paris Salon, and Guimard's own style and career began to change.{{Sfn|Vigne (2016)|page=197}}\n\n== Early career (1888\u20131898) ==\n=== Early works ===\nThe earliest constructed work of Guimard was the cafe-restaurant ''Au Grand Neptune'' (1888)<ref name=\"theartstory\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theartstory.org/artist/guimard-hector/life-and-legacy/#biography_header|title=Hector Guimard - Life and Legacy|website=theartstory.org|accessdate=17 February 2020}}</ref>, located on the Quai Auteuil in Paris at the edge of the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Paris Universal Exposition of 1889]].  It was picturesque but not strikingly innovative. It was demoilished in 1910. He constructed another picturesque structure for the Exposition, the Pavilion of Electricity, a showcase for the work of electrical engineer Ferdinand de Boy\u00e9res. Between 1889 and 1895 he constructed a dozen apartment buildings, villas and houses, mostly in the Paris 16th arrondissement or suburbs,  including the Hotel Rosz\u00e9 (1891) and the Hotel Jassed\u00e9 (1893) without attracting much attention. He earned his living primarily from his teaching at the School of Decorative Arts.{{Sfn|Vigne (2016)|page=188}}\n\n=== The Castel B\u00e9ranger (1895-1898) ===\nGuimard's first recognized major work was the [[Castel B\u00e9ranger]] in Paris, an apartment building with thirty-six units constructed between 1895 and 1898, when the architect was just thirty years old.  at 14, rue Jean de la Fontaine, Paris, for Mme. Fournier. He persuaded his client to abandon a more restrained design and replace it with a new design in a more modern style, similar to that of Horta's [[Hotel Tassel]], which he had visited in the summer of 1895.{{Sfn|Vigne (2016)|page=197}} Guimard put together an extraordinary number of stylistic effects and theatrical elements on the facade and in the interior, using cast iron, glass and ceramics for decoration. The lobby, decorated with sinuous vine-like cast iron and colorful ceramics, resembled an undersea grotto. He designed every detail, including the wallpaper, rain spouts and door handles, and added adding highly modern new features including a telephone booth in the lobby.{{Sfn|Vigne (2016)|Page=40-45}}.  \n\nA skilled publicist, Guimard very effectively used the new building to advertise his work.  He had his own apartment and office in the building. He organized conferences and press articles, set up an exhibition of his drawings in the salons of ''Le Figaro'', and wrote a monograph on the building. In 1899 He entered it into the first Paris competition for the best new  building facades, and in March 1899 it was selected one of the six winners, a fact which he proudly had inscribed on the facade of the building.{{Sfn|Vigne (2016)|Page=40-45}} \n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Paris 16 - Castel B\u00e9ranger -1.JPG|Facade of the Castel B\u00e9ranger\nFile:Castel B\u00e9ranger, February 16, 2013.jpg|Gateway\nFile:Le hall dentr\u00e9e du Castel B\u00e9ranger (Hector Guimard) (5479354274).jpg|Entrance hall\nFile:Paris 16 - Castel B\u00e9ranger -10.JPG|Balcony decoration\nFile:Un des hippocampes du Castel B\u00e9ranger (Paris) (4818198698).jpg|Exterior decoration\nFile:Le Vesinet villa Berthe La Hublotiere Hector Guimard.jpg|Villa Berthe (1896)\n</gallery>\n\n== Mature career (1898\u20131914) ==\n=== Castels, Villas and a short-lived Concert Hall ===\nThe success and publicity created by the Castel Beranger quickly brought him commissions for other residential buildings. Between 1898 and 1900 he constructed three houses simultaneously, each very different but recognizably in Guimard's style. The first, the [[Maison Coilliot]], was built for the ceramics manufacturer Louis Coilliot on rue de Fleurs in [[Lille]], and served as his store, reception hall and residence. The facade was covered with plaques of green enamelled volcanic rock, and decorated with soaring arches, curling wrought iron, and Guimard's characteristic asymmetric, organic doorways and windows.{{Sfn|Vigne (2016)|pages=66-83}}\n\nThe following year, 1899, while he continued to teach regularly at the school of decorative arts in Paris, and continued construction of the Maison Coilliot, he began three new houses;  The Modern Castel or Villa Canivet in [[Garches]] was Guimard's reinvention of a medieval castle. [[La Bluette]] in  [[Hermanville-sur-Mer]] was Guimard's update of traditional  Norman architecture. and the [[Castel Henriette]], in Sevres. The Castel Henriette was the most inventive.  It was located on a small site, almost circular, and was crowned with a tall, slender watchtower.  To create more open interior space, Guimard moved the stairwell to the side of the building.  The interior wss lit by large windows, and featured ensembles of furniture all designed by Guimard.  The building had an unhappy history.  The watchtower fell in 1903, apparently after being struck by lightning. Guimard was summoned back and redesigned the house, adding new balconies and terrace. However, by the 1960s, the building was considered out of fashion, and it was rarely occupied. It served as a movie set before it was finally demolished, despite appeals by preservationists. Some of the furniture is now found in museums.{{Sfn|Vigne (2016)|pages=66-83}} \n\nIn 1898 Guimard embarked upon another ambitious project, the construction of a concert hall, the Salle Humbert-de-Romans, located at 60 Rue Saint Didier (16th arrondissement). It was  built as the centrepiece of a conservatory of Christian music intended for orphans, proposed by a Dominican monk, Father Levy. Guimard made an ambitious and non-traditional plan using soaring levels of iron and glass, inspired by an early idea of [[Eugene Viollet-le-Duc]]. An organ manufacturer, in consultation with [[Camille Saint-Saens]], donated a grand organ.   The Salle was completed in 1901, but a scandal involving Father Levy and the orphans broke out. Father Levy was exiled by the Pope to Constantnople, the foundation was dissolved, and the concert hall was used only for meetings and conferences.  It closed in 1904 and was demolished in 1905. The grand organ moved to the church of Saint-Vincent-de-Pual in Clichy, where it can be found today.{{Sfn|Vigne (2016)|page=190}}<ref>Fernand Mazade, \u00ab\u00a0An \"Art Nouveau\" Edifice in Paris, The Architectural Record, vol. 12, no\u00a01, May  1902, p.\u00a051-66 (consultable on  archive.org)</ref>  \n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Lille maison coilliot ass.jpg|The [[Maison Coilliot]] in [[Lille]] (1898-1900)\nFile:Hermanville bluette digue.jpg|Villa [[La Bluette]] in Hermanville-sur-Mer, Calvados (1899-1900)\nFile:Castel Henriette Guimard No. 13.jpg|[[Castel Henriette]], [[Sevres]] (1899-1900)\nFile:Henriette1914.jpg|Castel Henriette after the removal of the watchtower \nFile:Salle Humbert de Romans (ext\u00e9rieur).jpg|The Salle Humbert-de-Romans (1898-1901)\nFile:Salle Humbert-de-Romans.jpg|Colored postcard of the interior of the Salle-Humbert-de-Romans\n</gallery>\n\n=== Paris Metro entrances ===\n{{main|Paris M\u00e9tro entrances by Hector Guimard}}\nThe highly-publicized debut of the Hotel B\u00e9ranger quickly brought Horta new projects, including villas, a Paris concert hall, and, most famously, entrances for the stations of the new [[Paris Metro]], which was planned to open in 1900 in time for the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Paris Universal Exposition]].  A new organization, the chemin de fer m\u00e9tropolitan de Paris (CFP, now RATP) was created in April 1899 to build and manage the system. They organized a competition for station entrance edicules, or canopies, and balustrades, or railings.  This attracted twenty-one applicants. Guimard did not apply. The twenty-one original applicants proposed edicules built of masonry, in various historic and picturesque styles. These were ridiculed in the press as resembling newspaper stands, funeral monuments, or public toilets. Time was short, and Guimard presented sketches of his own idea for entrances made of iron and glass, which would be quicker and simpler to manufacture. He was given the commission on 12 January 1900, just a few months before the opening of the system.{{Sfn|Vigne (2016)|pages=85-103}}\n\nTo simplify the manufacture, Guimard made two designs of edicules, called Type A and B. Both were made of cast iron frames, with cream-colored walls and glass roofs to protect against rain. The A type was simpler and more cubic, while the B was rounded and more dynamic in form, and is sometimes compared with a [[dragonfly]].  Only two of the original A types were made and neither still exists. Only one B type, restored, remains in its original location, at [[Porte Dauphine]].{{Sfn|Vigne (2016)|pages=88-89}}\n\nGuimard also designed a simpler version, without a roof, with railings or balustrades of ornamental green-painted iron escutcheons and two high pylons with lamps and a 'M\u00e9tropolitain' sign.   The pylons were in an abstract vegetal form he invented, not resembling any particular plant, and the lettering was in a unique which Guimard invented. These were the most common type.{{Sfn|Vigne (2016)|pages=88-89}}\n\nFrom the beginning, Guimard's Metro entrances were controversial.  In 1904, after complaints that the new Guimard balustrade  at the Opera station was not in harmony with the architecture of the [[Palais Garnier]] opera house, the Metro authorities dismantled the entrance and replaced it with a more classical model.   Garnier was sarcastic in his response in the Paris ''La Press'' of Paris on October 4, 1904.  \"Should we harmonise the station of P\u00e8re-Lachaise with the cemetery by constructing an entrance in the form of a tomb?...Should we have a dancer with her leg raised in front of the station at place Dame-Blanche, to harmonise with the Moulin-Rouge?\"{{Sfn|Vigne (2016)|pages=88-89}}\n\nFrom the beginning, Guimard was also in conflict with the Metro authorities about his payments. The dispute was ended in 1903 with an agreement by which Guimard received payment, but gave up his models and manufacturing rights. Construction of new stations continued using his design without his participation. Between 1900 and 1913,<ref name=Graham>F. Lanier Graham, ''Hector Guimard'', Exhibition Catalog, New York: Museum of Modern Art, 1970, {{OCLC|81368}}, p.&nbsp;14.</ref> a total of 167 entrances were installed, of which sixty-six still survive, mostly in locations different from their original placement.{{Sfn|Vigne (2016)|pages=88-89}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Paris Metro 2 Porte Dauphine Libellule.JPG|[[Porte Dauphine]] M\u00e9tro station, the only surviving entrance in its original location\nFile:Abbesses entrance 2.jpg|[[Abbesses]] station entrance \nFile:Paris metro sign May 1, 2011.jpg|Lamps and \"M\u00e9tropolitain\" sign, [[Anvers (Paris M\u00e9tro)|Anvers]]\nFile:Magasins R\u00e9unis 171 - PARIS - Station du M\u00e9tropolitain - Place de la Bastille.JPG|[[Bastille (Paris M\u00e9tro)|Bastille]] m\u00e9tro pavilion entrance (demolished in 1962)\nFile:Paris M\u00e9tro Quatre-Septembre 906.jpg|Railing escutcheon with \"M\", [[Quatre-Septembre (Paris M\u00e9tro)|Quatre-Septembre]]\nFile:Metro de Paris detail entree Guimard.jpg|Detail of an entrance's lamp post\n</gallery>\n\n=== Late Villas ===\nIn the early years of the 20th century, Guimard's popularity diminished and his earlier frenetic pace of production slowed down. His works shown at the 1903 Paris Exposition of residential architecture did not attract the attention of the Castel Beranger and other earlier work.  He was supported largely by one wealthy client, L\u00e9on Nozal, and his friends. His works for this group included the La Sapiniere, a small beach house at [[Hermanville-sur-Mer]], near his earlier La Bluette house; La Surprise, a villa at Cabourg; and the Castel Val at [[Auvers-sur-Oise]].  In Paris he constructed the Hotel Nozal on Rue Ranelagh for his friend; the Hotel Jassad\u00e9 for Louis Jassad\u00e9 on Avenue de Versailles; and the palatial Castel d'Orgeval, which was the centrepiece of a new residential development at [[Villemoisson-sur-Orge]] in the Paris suburbs.{{Sfn|Vigne (2016)|page=126}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Photograph, Exterior of Castel d'Orgeval, Overview of Main Facade, 1904 (CH 18449503).jpg|Drawing of the Castel d'Orgeval by Guimard (1904)\nFile:Hector Guimard - Rear Facade, Castel d'Orgeval, Parc Beaus\u00e9jour, near Paris- Elevation - Google Art Project.jpg|Plan of the Castel d'Orgeval drawn by Guimard (1904)\nFile:1900Sapi0015.jpg|La Sapini\u00e8re (1907) around the time of its completion (today considerably modified from Guimard's original design)\n</gallery>\n\n=== The H\u00f4tel Guimard ===\nThe most important work of this period is the [[H\u00f4tel Guimard (Art Nouveau)|Hotel Guimard]],  built in 1909 at 122 Avenue Mozart (XVIth arrondissement) in Paris, ten years after his first success with the Hotel Beranger. It was built following his marriage on with [[Adeline Oppenheim]], an American painter from a wealthy family.  The land was purchased three months after the marriage, and in June 1910 Guimard was able to move the offices of his agency into the ground floor.  The house was not occupied by the couple, however, for two more years, while the furniture he designed was manufactured.  The house is located on a triangular lot, which proved a particularly challenge for Guimard.  He saved interior space by installing an inclined elevator rather than a stairway on the upper floors.  The house was designed to show its functions on the facade;  his wife could paint in one portion of the house, with large windows, while he worked in his bureau in another part of the house.  It had a very large dining room and many tables, but no kitchen; it was apparently designed for working and entertaining.  The house was later broken up into apartments, and the original room arrangements and furniture are gone.{{Sfn|Vigne (2016)|page=126-127}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Adeline and Hector Guimard.jpg|thumb|Hector Guimard with his wife Adeline, around 1910\nFile:H\u00f4tel Guimard 2019.jpg|Facade of the H\u00f4tel Guimard.

Between 1910 and 1911 he built H\u00f4tel Mezzara for Paul Mezzara, experimenting with skylights. Another notable work of this period is the [[Agoudas Hakehilos Synagogue]] at 10 Rue Pav\u00e9 (IV arrondissement) in the [[Marais district]]. The synagogue, Guimard's only religious building, is characterised by a narrow fa\u00e7ade clad in white stone, whose surface curves and undulates while highlighting verticality. Like with his previous projects, Guimard designed the interiors as well, organising the spaces and creating original furnishings that matched the architectural motifs of the structure. The construction begun in 1913 with the inauguration taking place on June 7, 1914, just a few weeks before the beginning of the First World War. \n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Guimard-16eme-artnouveau-11-rue-millet.jpg|Apartment building \"Tr\u00e9mois\", Rue Millet, Paris XVI arrondissement  (1909)\nFile:Guimard-16eme-artnouveau-rue-agar-detail2.jpg|Detail of the Rue Agar (then Rue Moderne) apartments (1910-1912).\nFile:D\u00e9cor dun immeuble art nouveau dHector Guimard \u00e0 Paris (4818961578).jpg|Detail of windows from the Rue de la Fontain apartments (1911).\nFile:Paris 16 - H\u00f4tel Mezzara -1.JPG|H\u00f4tel Mezzara (1910-1911), exterior view.\nFile:Hotel mezzara 2343.jpg|The interiors of the H\u00f4tel Mezzara, with Art Nouveau stairway and glass roof.\nFile:Guimard-4eme-artnouveau-10-rue-pavee-synagogue.jpg|[[Agoudas Hakehilos Synagogue]] rue Pav\u00e9e, Paris, 1913\nFile:Synagogue rue pav\u00e9e Paris02.jpg|Decoration of entrance of the [[Agoudas Hakehilos Synagogue]]\nFile:Paris Synagogue RuePav\u00e9e innen399.JPG|Interior of the [[Agoudas Hakehilos Synagogue]]\n</gallery>\n\n== Late career (1914\u20131942) ==\n=== World War I and post-war years ===\nBy the time the [[First World War]] began in August 1914, [[Art Nouveau]] was already out of fashion.  The army and war economy took almost all available workers and building materials.  Most of Guimard's projects were shelved. and Guimard gave up his furniture workshop on Avenue Perrichont. He left Paris and to reside most of the war in a luxury hotel in [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]] and [[Candes-Saint-Martin]], where he wrote essays and pamphlets calling for an end to militarized society, and also, more practically, studying ideas standardized housing that could be constructed more quickly and less expensively, anticipating the need to reconstruct housing destroyed in the War. He received a dozen patents for his new inventions.{{Sfn|Vigne (2016|page=171}}<ref name=\"vigneferre\">{{cite book |last1=Vigne |first1=Georges |last2=Felipe |first2=Ferr\u00e9|date=2003 |title=Hector Guimard |url= |location= |publisher=Charles Moreau |page= |isbn= |author-link= |language=French}}</ref> \n\nOne of the rare completed buildings still standing from this period is the office building at 10 Rue de Bretagne, begun in 1914 but not completed until after the War in 1919.{{Sfn|Vigne (2016|page=192}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lecercleguimard.fr/fr/hector-guimard-architecte/loeuvre-de-guimard/oeuvre-batie-hector-guimard/|title=Le Cercle Guimard - L'\u0153uvre b\u00e2ti|website=lecercleguimard.fr|accessdate=16 February 2020|language=French}}</ref>  The Art Nouveau style was replaced by a more functional simplicity, where the reinforced concrete structure defined the exterior of the building.  The postwar shortages of iron and other materials affected the style; there was little decoration of the facade, or entrance.

He returned to Paris and in 1921-22, and built a small house at 3 Square Jasmin (16th arrondissement) designed to be a model for a series of standard houses, but it was not duplicated.  He was  unable to keep up with the rapid changes in styles and methods, and His firm was finally dissolved in July 1925.{{Sfn|Vigne (2016)| page=198}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Photograph, Photograph of the Construction of a Mass-operational House Designed by Hector Guimard (No. 21), 1921 (CH 18387463).jpg|Model fa\u00e7ade of the mass-produced house (1921)\nFile:Photograph, Photograph of the Construction of a Mass-operational House Designed by Hector Guimard (No. 14), 1921 (CH 18387447).jpg|Cast pieces to be assembled for the mass-produced house\nFile:Drawing, Design for a Mass-Operational House Designed by Hector Guimard, Wall Construction, October 1920 (CH 18410953).jpg|Instructions for the construction of the mass-produced house, drawing by Guimard (October 1920)\n</gallery>\n\n\nIn 1925 he participated in the Paris Exposition of Decorative and Modern Arts,  the Exposition which gave its name to [[Art Deco]], with a proposed model of a town  hall for a French village.  He also designed and built a parking garage and several war memorials and funeral monuments.   He continued to receive honors, particularly for his teaching at the \u00c9cole national des arts decoratifs. In February 1929 he was named a Chevalier in the French [[Legion d'honneur]].{{Sfn|Vigne (2016)| page=198}}\n\nAfter the war, [[Art Deco]] emerged as the leading style of Parisian architecture. Guimard adapted to the new style and proved his originality and attention to the detail. His buildings display geometric decorative patterns, simplified columns emphasizing structural elements and rigid shapes; despite this they retain elements of his previous style: sinuous lines, vegetal-inspired ornaments and typical Art Nouveau iron railings.<ref name=\"vigneferre\"/>\n\n===The Guimard Building and final works ===\nHis next project, the Guimard Building, an apartment building at 18 Rue Henri Heine, Paris (XVI arrondissement, begun in 1926. is his last major project still standing.    He made a skilful of different-colored brick and stone to create decorative designs on the facade, and added triangular sculpted windows on the roof level, and, in the interior. a very remarkable central stairway with curling iron railings and hexagonal windows of colored and clear glass bricks  In 1928 he entered the building into the competition for the best Paris facades, the same competition that he had entered in 1898 with the H\u00f4tel Beranger. He was a winner again, and was the first Paris architect to enter twice and to win twice.  This building became his residence, though he was not able to move in until 1930.  {{Sfn|Vigne (2016)|page=129}}. \n\nDespite his success with the facade competition, his late work appeared old fashioned, particularly compared with the modernism of the Paris buildings of [[Robert Mallet-Stevens]], [[August Perret]], and [[Le Corbusier]].   Between 1926 and 1930 he built several residential buildings in the same neighborhood as his home in the 16th arrondissement, which still exist. These include the H\u00f4tel Houyvet, at 2 Villa Flore and 120 Avenue Mozart, built for the industrialist Michel Antoine Paul Houyhvet. His last recorded work was La Guimardi\u00e8re, an apartment building on Avenue Le N\u00f4tre, Vaucresson in the [[Hauts-de-Seine]] suburb of Paris. It was completed in about 1930, but was demolished in March-April 1969.{{Sfn|Vigne (2016)| page=198}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Rue Henri Heine 18.jpg|THe Guimard Building at Rue Henri-Heine, Paris XVI arrondissement (1926).\nFile:Rue Henri Heine 18 porte.jpg|Detail of the Guimard Building,  showing the entrance, where Art Deco and Art Nouveau elements coexist.\nFile:Rue Greuze 36-38 Guimard 1926-1929.jpg|Apartmet building,  Rue Greuze (28), (Paris XVI arrondissement) \n</gallery>\n\nAs early as 1918 he took steps to assure that his work would be documented and would survive. He obtained space in the former orangerie of the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], where he deposited models of his buildings and hundreds of designs. In 1936 he donated a large collection of his designs to [[Alfred Barr]], the director of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York. In 1937 he received authorisation to put thirty cases of models in the cellars of the National Museum of Antiquities in Saint-Germaine-en-Laye.{{Sfn|Vigne (2016) page=198}}\n\nGuimard served as a member of the jury judging architectural works at the [[1937 Paris Exposition]],  where he could hardly miss the monumental pavilion of Nazi Germany and the threat it presented. His wife was Jewish, and he was alarmed by the approaching likelihood of war. In September, 1938, he and his wife settled in New York City.  He died on May 20, 1942 at the [[1049 Fifth Avenue|Hotel Adams]] on Fifth Avenue. He is buried in [[Gate of Heaven Cemetery (Hawthorne, New York)|Gate of Heaven Cemetery]] in Hawthorne, New York, about 25 miles north of New York City.{{Sfn|Vigne (2016)|page=198}}\n\n==Obscurity and Rediscovery ==\nAfter the War, in June-July 1948, his widow returned to Paris to settle his affairs. She offered the Hotel Guimard as a site for a Guimard Museum first to the French state, then to the City of Paris, but both refused.  Instead, she donated three rooms of Guimard's furniture to three museums;  the [[Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon]], the [[Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs, Paris|Museum of Decorative Arts]] in Paris, and the Museum of the [[Petit Palais]], where they are now displayed. She also donated a collection of three hundred designs and photographs to the Museum of Decorative Arts  These disappeared into various archives  the 1960s, but were relocated in 2015. His widow died on 26 October 1965 in New York.<ref name=academiaPDF>{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/36208314|title=Adeline Oppenheim Guimard 1872-1965 artiste et m\u00e9c\u00e8ne|website=www.academia.edu|accessdate=12 February 2020|language=French}}</ref> {{Sfn|Vigne (2016)|page=198}}\n\nBy the time of Guimard's death, many of his buildings had already been demolished or remodeled beyond recognition. Most of his original Metro station edicules and balustrades had also been removed. The only full covering remaining at its original location at [[Porte Dauphine (Paris Metro)|Porte Dauphine]].  However, many  original architectural drawings by Guimard were  stored in the Dept. of Drawings & Archives at [[Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library]] at [[Columbia University]] in New York City, and in the archives of the Museum of Decorative Arts in Paris.  {{Sfn|Vigne (2016) page=198}}\n\nThe re-evaluation and rehabilitation of Guimard's reputation began in the late 1960s.  Portions of the [[Castel Beranger]] were declared of historic and artistic value in July 1965, and the entire building was protected in 1989.{{Sfn|Vigne (2016)|page=189}} His reputation  was given a major boost in 1970, when the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York hosted a large exhibition of his work, including drawings he had donated himself and one of his Metro Station edicules. Other museums followed.  The thirty cases of models in the cellars of the National Museum of Antiquities in Saint-Germaine-en-Laye were rediscovered and some were put on display.\n\nIn 1978 all of Guimard's surviving Metro entrances (Eighty-eight of the original one hundred sixty-seven put in place) were declared of historic value. The city donated a few originals, and several copies, to Chicago and other cities which desired them. Reconstructed original edicules are found at [[Abbesses (Paris Metro)|Abbesses]] and [[Ch\u00e2telet (Paris Metro)|Ch\u00e2telet]]. {{Sfn|Vigne (2016)|page=191}}.  \n\nMany of his buildings have been substantially modified, and there are no intact Guimard interiors which are open to the  public, though suites of his furniture can be found in the Museum of Decorative Arts and the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in Paris.\n\n== Furniture ==\nLike other prominent Art Nouveau architects, Guimard also designed furniture and other interior decoration to harmonize with his buildings.  It took him some time to find his own style in furniture. The furniture he designed for the Hotel Delfau (1894), which he put on display at an Exposition in 1895, was picturesque and ornate, with a sort of star motif, which seemed to have little connection with the architecture of the house. His early furniture sometimes featured had long looping arms  and lateral shelves and levels for displays of objects. He apparently did not produce any furniture for the Hotel Beranger, other than a desk and chairs for his own studio there.  In his early years he is known to have produced only two full sets of furniture, a dining room set for the Castel Henriette and a dining room for the Villa La Bluette.He also designed furnishings without any particular room in mind, as he did with watercolor designs for the Russian Princess Maria Tenisheva in 1903.{{Sfn|Vigne (2016)|page=151-152}}\n\nHis furniture style began to change in about 1903.  He found a workshop to make his furniture, and began using finer woods, particularly pear wood, with delicate colors. He simplified he plans, and eliminated the excessive number of arms and shelves.

He invented his own style of lettering  which appeared on his Metro entrances and his building plans.   He insisted on calling his work \"Style Guimard\", not Art Nouveau, and he was genius at publicizing it.  He wrote numerous articles and gave interviews and lectures on his work, and printed a set of  \"Style Guimard\" postcards with his pictures of his buildings, {{Sfn|Vigne (2016|page=106-109}}\n \nGuimard rejected the dominant academic [[Beaux-Arts style]]  of there 1880s, calling it  \"cold receptacle of various past styles in which the original spirit was no longer alive enough to dwell\"<ref name=\":0\" />. His fellow students at the National School of Decorative Arts nicknamed him the  \"Ravachol of architecture\", after [[Ravachol]], the Paris anarchist who bombed church buildings. <ref name=\":0\" />  Noneless. he was recognized for his designing skills; in 1884 he was awarded three bronze and two silver medals at the school for his work. In 1885 he received awards in all of the competitions at the school, including four bronze medallions, five silver, and the school's Grande Prix d'Architecture.\n \t\nGuimard's early Art Nouveau work, particularly the [[Castel Beranger]], as Guimard himself acknowledged, was strongly influenced by the work of the Belgian architect [[Victor Horta]], especially the [[Hotel Tassel]], which Guimard visited before he designed the Castel Beranger.  Like Horta, he created original designs and ornament, inspired by his own views of nature. If the skylights favored by [[Victor Horta]] are rare in his work (the Mezzara Hotel, 1910, and the [[Agoudas Hakehilos Synagogue|Rue Pav\u00e9e Synagogue]], (1913), being notable exceptions), Guimard made noteworthy experiments in space and volume.  These include the [[Maison Coilliot|Coilliot House]]<ref>[http://lartnouveau.com/artistes/guimard/maison_coilliot.htm Maison Coilliot \u00e0 Lille], lartnouveau.com</ref> and its disconcerting double-frontage (1898), and the Villa [[La Bluette]]<ref>[http://lartnouveau.com/artistes/guimard/pavillons/villa_bluette.htm La Villa La Bluette], lartnouveau.com</ref>, noted for its volumetric harmony (1898), and especially the Castel Henriette<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040608095029/http://lecercleguimard.com/accueil.html Accueil], lecercleguimard.com</ref> (1899) and the Castel d'Orgeval<ref>[http://aplressources.free.fr/GUIMARDOC/5t.html Guimard (5t.jpg] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302083456/http://aplressources.free.fr/GUIMARDOC/5t.html |date=2007-03-02 }}, aplressources.free.fr</ref> (1905), demonstrations of an asymmetrical \"free plan\", twenty-five years before the theories of [[Le Corbusier]].  Other buildings of his, like the H\u00f4tel Nozal (1905), employ a rational, symmetrical, square-based style inspired by [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc|Viollet-le-Duc]].<ref>[http://lartnouveau.com/artistes/guimard/documents/hotel_nozal.htm L'H\u00f4tel Nozal d'Hector Guimard], lartnouveau.com</ref> \n\nGuimard employed some structural innovations, as in the concert hall Humbert-de-Romans<ref>[http://lecercleguimard.fr/fr/le-cercle-guimard/projets/salle-humbert-de-romans Salle Humbert de Romans] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130412195200/http://lecercleguimard.fr/fr/le-cercle-guimard/projets/salle-humbert-de-romans |date=2013-04-12 }}, lecercleguimard.com</ref> (1901), where he created a complex frame to divide sound waves to produce enhanced acoustics (built 1898 and demolished in 1905), or as in the [[H\u00f4tel Guimard]] (1909), where the ground was too narrow to have the exterior walls bear any weight, and thus the arrangement of interior spaces differs from one floor to another.<ref>[http://lartnouveau.com/documents/wiki/guimard/hotel_guimard_1er_et.jpg Lartnouveau.com]</ref>\n \t\nIn addition to his architecture, furniture, and wrought iron work, Guimard also designed art objects, such as vases, some of which were produced by the [[Manufacture nationale de S\u00e8vres]] outside Paris.  A notable example is the Vase of Binelles (1902), made by crystallization on hard porcelain, It is now in the National Museum of Ceramics in S\u00e8vres. \n\nGuimard was a determined advocate of architectural standardization, from mass-producing Metro station edicules and balustrades to (less successfully) the mass production of cast iron pieces and other prefabricated building materials intended for the assembly rows of houses.

But neither is it merely withered and graceless floral or animal skeletons that Mr. Guimard draws. He is inspired by the underlying movements, by the creative process in nature that reveals to us identical formulas through its numerous manifestations. And he assimilates these principles in the formation of his ornamental contours... the floret is not an exact representation of any particular flower, Here is an art that both abbreviates and amplifies the immediate facts of Nature; it spiritualises them. We are present at the birth of the quintessence of a flower.\"<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>\n\n==Chronology of notable buildings==\n[[File:Paris 16 - Castel B\u00e9ranger -1.JPG|thumb|right|100px|[[Castel Beranger]] (completed 1898)]]\n[[File:Lille maison coilliot ass.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Maison Coilliot]] (1898)]]\n[[File:Castel Henriette Guimard No. 13.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Castel Henriette]] (1898)]]\n[[File:Abbesses entrance 2.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Abbesses (Paris M\u00e9tro)]] (1900)]]\n[[File:Paris 16 - Immeuble Jass\u00e9d\u00e9 142 avenue de Versailles -1.JPG|thumb|right|100px|Immeuble Jass\u00e9d\u00e9 (1903-1905)]]\n[[File:Guimard-16eme-artnouveau-11-rue-millet-face.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Immeuble Tremois (1909)]] \n[[File:Photograph, Exterior View of the House of Hector Guimard, ca. 1910 (CH 18411087-2).jpg|thumb|right|100px|H\u00f4tel Guimard (1909)]]\n[[File:Paris-Marais-Synagoge-102-2017-gje.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Synagogue de la rue Pav\u00e9e \u00e0 Paris]] (1913)]]\n\n==== 1889: ====\n*Caf\u00e9 Au grand Neptune, quai Louis-Bl\u00e9riot, Paris XVI (destroyed about 1910):\n*Pavillion d'Electricit\u00e9 at the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)]], avenue Suffren, Pais (destroyed 1889):\n==== 1891: ====\n* H\u00f4tel Rosz\u00e9, 34 rue Boileau, Paris, 16th arrondissement\n* Two pavilions for Alphonse-Marie Hannequin, 145 Avenue de Versailles, Paris XVI  (destroyed 1926)\n==== 1892: ====\n* Villa Toucy, 189 rue du Vieux-Pont-de-Sevres, Billancourt (destroyed 1912-13)\n* Maisons jumelles L\u00e9colle\n* Pavillon de chasse Rose, 14 et 14ter, rue des Tilleuls, Limeil-Br\u00e9vannes, Val-de-Marne (d\u00e9truit vers 1960)\n==== 1893: ====\n* H\u00f4tel Jassed\u00e9, 41 rue Chardon-Lagache (protected)\n==== 1894: ====\n* H\u00f4tel Delfau, 1 rue Molitor, Paris XVI (modified)\n==== 1895: ====\n* \u00c9cole du Sacr\u00e9-Coeur, 9 Avenue de la Frilli\u00e9re, Paris XVI.

{"title_page": "Renormalization group", "text_new": "{{Renormalization and regularization}}\n\nIn [[theoretical physics]], the '''renormalization group''' ('''RG''') refers to a mathematical apparatus that allows systematic  investigation of the changes of a physical system as viewed at different [[Scale (analytical tool)|scales]]. In [[particle physics]], it reflects the changes in the underlying force laws (codified in a [[quantum field theory]]) as  the energy scale at which physical processes occur varies, energy/momentum  and resolution distance scales being effectively conjugate under the [[uncertainty principle]].\n\nA change in scale is called a [[Scale invariance|scale transformation]].  The renormalization group is intimately related to ''scale invariance'' and ''conformal invariance'', symmetries in which a system appears the same at all scales (so-called [[self-similarity]]).{{efn|Note that [[Scale invariance|scale transformations]] are a strict subset of [[Conformal symmetry|conformal transformations]], in general, the latter including additional symmetry generators associated with [[special conformal transformation]]s.}}\n\nAs the scale varies, it is as if one is changing the magnifying power of a notional microscope viewing the system. In so-called renormalizable theories, the system at one scale will generally be seen to consist of self-similar copies of itself when viewed at a smaller scale, with different parameters describing the components of the system. The components, or fundamental variables, may  relate to atoms, elementary particles, atomic spins, etc.  The parameters of the theory typically describe the interactions of the components. These may be variable [[coupling constant|couplings]] which measure the strength of various forces, or mass parameters themselves. The components themselves may appear to be composed of more of the self-same components as one goes to shorter distances.\n\n==History==<!--'History of renormalization group theory' redirects here-->\nThe idea of scale transformations and scale invariance is old in physics: Scaling arguments were commonplace for the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean school]], [[Euclid]], and up to [[Galileo]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.av8n.com/physics/scaling.htm |title=Introduction to Scaling Laws |website=av8n.com}}</ref> They became popular again at the end of the 19th&nbsp;century, perhaps the first example being the idea of enhanced [[viscosity]] of [[Osborne Reynolds]], as a way to explain turbulence.\n\nThe renormalization group was initially devised in particle physics, but nowadays its applications extend to [[solid-state physics]], [[fluid mechanics]], [[physical cosmology]], and even [[nanotechnology]]. An early article<ref>{{cite journal |author1-link=Ernst Stueckelberg |last=Stueckelberg |first=E.C.G. |author2-link=Andr\u00e9 Petermann |first2=A. |last2=Petermann |year=1953 |url=https://www.e-periodica.ch/cntmng?pid=hpa-001:1953:26::894 |title=La renormalisation des constants dans la th\u00e9orie de quanta |journal=Helv.

Stueckelberg and Petermann opened the field conceptually. They noted that [[renormalization]] exhibits a group of transformations which transfer quantities from the bare terms to the counter terms. They introduced a function ''h''(''e'') in [[Quantum electrodynamics| quantum electrodynamics (QED)]], which is now called the [[Beta-function#Quantum electrodynamics|beta function]] (see below).\n\n===Beginnings===\n[[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[Francis E. Low]] restricted the idea to scale transformations in QED in 1954,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gell-Mann |first=M. |authorlink=Murray Gell-Mann |author2=Low, F. E. |authorlink2=Francis E.

They determined the variation of the electromagnetic coupling in QED, by appreciating the simplicity of the scaling structure of that theory. They thus discovered that the coupling parameter ''g''(''\u03bc'') at the energy scale ''\u03bc'' is effectively given by the group equation\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =:\n|equation =  <math>g(\\mu)=G^{-1}\\left(\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{M}\\right)^d G(g(M))\\right)</math>,\n|cellpadding= 6\n|border\n|border colour = #0073CF\n|bgcolor=#F9FFF7}}\nfor some function ''G'' (unspecified\u2014nowadays called [[Franz Wegner|Wegner]]'s scaling function) and a constant ''d'', in terms of the coupling ''g(M)'' at a reference scale ''M''.\n\nGell-Mann and Low realized in these results that the effective scale can be arbitrarily taken as ''\u03bc'', and can vary to define the theory at any other scale:\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =:\n|equation =  <math>g(\\kappa)=G^{-1}\\left(\\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{\\mu}\\right)^d G(g(\\mu))\\right) = G^{-1}\\left(\\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{M}\\right)^d G(g(M))\\right)</math>.\n|cellpadding= 6\n|border\n|border colour = #0073CF\n|bgcolor=#F9FFF7}}\nThe gist of the RG is this group property: as the scale ''\u03bc'' varies, the theory presents a self-similar replica of itself, and any scale can be accessed similarly from any other scale, by group action, a formal transitive conjugacy of couplings<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Curtright |first1=T.L. |authorlink1=Thomas Curtright |last2=Zachos |first2=C.K. |date=March 2011 |title=Renormalization Group Functional Equations |journal=Physical Review D |volume=83 |issue=6 |pages=065019 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.83.065019 |bibcode=2011PhRvD..83f5019C |arxiv=1010.5174}}</ref> in the mathematical sense ([[Schr\u00f6der's equation]]).\n\nOn the basis of this (finite) group equation and its scaling property, Gell-Mann and Low could then focus on infinitesimal transformations, and invented a computational method based on a mathematical flow function {{math|''\u03c8''(''g'') {{=}} ''G'' ''d''/(\u2202''G''/\u2202''g'')}} of the coupling parameter ''g'', which they introduced. Like the function ''h''(''e'') of Stueckelberg and Petermann, their function determines the differential change of the coupling ''g''(''\u03bc'') with respect to a small change in energy scale ''\u03bc'' through a differential equation, the ''renormalization group equation'':\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =:\n|equation =  <math> \\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\ln\\mu} = \\psi(g) = \\beta(g) </math>.\n|cellpadding= 6\n|border\n|border colour = #0073CF\n|bgcolor=#F9FFF7}}\n\nThe modern name is also indicated, the [[Beta function (physics)|beta function]], introduced by [[Curtis Callan|C.

The renormalization group prediction (cf. Stueckelberg\u2013Petermann and Gell-Mann\u2013Low works) was confirmed 40&nbsp;years later at the [[LEP]] accelerator experiments: the [[Fine-structure constant|fine structure \"constant\"]] of QED was measured to be about {{frac|1|127}} at energies close to 200&nbsp;GeV, as opposed to the standard low-energy physics value of {{frac|1|137}}&nbsp;.{{efn|Early applications to [[quantum electrodynamics]] are discussed in the influential 1959 book ''The Theory of Quantized Fields'' by [[Nikolay Bogolyubov]] and [[Dmitry Shirkov]].<ref>{{cite book |author1-link=Nikolay Bogolyubov |first1=N.N. |last1=Bogoliubov |author2-link=Dmitry Shirkov |first2=D.V. |last2=Shirkov |year=1959 |title=The Theory of Quantized Fields |place=New York, NY |publisher=Interscience}}</ref>}}\n\n=== Deeper understanding ===\nThe renormalization group emerges from the [[renormalization]] of the quantum field variables, which normally has to address the problem of infinities in a quantum field theory.{{efn|Although note that the RG exists independently of the infinities.}} This problem of systematically handling the infinities of quantum field theory to obtain finite physical quantities was solved for QED by [[Richard Feynman]], [[Julian Schwinger]] and [[Shin'ichir\u014d Tomonaga]], who received the 1965 Nobel prize for these contributions. They effectively devised the theory of mass and charge renormalization, in which the infinity in the momentum scale is [[Cutoff (physics)|cut off]] by an ultra-large [[Regularization (physics)|regulator]], \u039b.{{efn|The regulator parameter \u039b could ultimately be taken to be infinite \u2013 infinities reflect the pileup of contributions from an infinity of degrees of freedom at infinitely high energy scales.}}\n\nThe dependence of physical quantities, such as the electric charge or electron mass, on the scale \u039b is hidden, effectively swapped for the longer-distance scales at which the physical quantities are measured, and, as a result, all observable quantities end up being finite instead, even for an infinite \u039b. Gell-Mann and Low thus realized in these results that, infinitesimally, while a tiny change in '' g'' is provided by the above RG equation given \u03c8(''g''), the self-similarity is expressed by the fact that \u03c8(''g'') depends explicitly only upon the parameter(s) of the theory, and not upon the scale ''\u03bc''. Consequently, the above renormalization group equation may be solved for (''G'' and thus) ''g''(''\u03bc'').\n\nA deeper understanding of the physical meaning and generalization of the renormalization process, which goes beyond the dilation group of conventional ''renormalizable'' theories, considers  methods where widely different scales of lengths appear simultaneously. It came from [[condensed matter physics]]: [[Leo P. Kadanoff]]'s paper in 1966 proposed the \"block-spin\" renormalization group.<ref name=Kadanoff>{{cite journal |author-link=Leo P.

Applications of the RG to particle physics exploded in number in the 1970s with the establishment of the [[Standard Model]].\n\nIn 1973,<ref>{{cite journal |first1=D.J. |last1=Gross |first2=F. |last2=Wilczek |year=1973 |title=Ultraviolet behavior of non-Abelian gauge theories |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=30 |issue= 26 |pages=1343\u20131346  |bibcode=1973PhRvL..30.1343G |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.30.1343|doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=H.D. |last=Politzer |year=1973 |title=Reliable perturbative results for strong interactions |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]  |volume=30 |issue=26 |pages=1346\u20131349 |bibcode=1973PhRvL..30.1346P  |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.30.1346|doi-access=free }}</ref> it was discovered that a theory of interacting colored quarks, called [[quantum chromodynamics]], had a negative beta function. This means that an initial high-energy value of the coupling will eventuate a special value of ''\u03bc'' at which the coupling blows up (diverges). This special value is the [[Strong coupling constant#QCD and asymptotic freedom|scale of the strong interactions]], [[Coupling constant#QCD scale|''\u03bc'' = \u039b<sub>QCD</sub>]] and occurs at about 200&nbsp;MeV. Conversely, the coupling becomes weak at very high energies ([[asymptotic freedom]]), and the quarks become observable as point-like particles, in [[deep inelastic scattering]], as anticipated by Feynman-Bjorken scaling. QCD was thereby established as the quantum field theory controlling the strong interactions of particles.\n\nMomentum space RG also became a highly developed tool in solid state physics, but its success was hindered by the extensive use of perturbation theory, which prevented the theory from reaching success in strongly correlated systems. In order to study these strongly correlated systems, [[Calculus of variations|variational]] approaches are a better alternative.\n\n=== Conformal symmetry ===\nThe conformal symmetry is associated with the vanishing of the beta function. This can occur naturally if a coupling constant is attracted, by running, toward a ''fixed point'' at which ''\u03b2''(''g'') = 0. In QCD, the fixed point occurs at short distances where ''g'' \u2192 0 and is called a ([[Quantum triviality|trivial]]) [[ultraviolet fixed point]].

Kadanoff]] in 1966.<ref name=Kadanoff/>\n\nConsider a 2{{mvar|D}} solid, a set of atoms in a perfect square array, as depicted in the figure.\n\n[[File:Rgkadanoff.png|180px]]\n\nAssume that atoms interact among themselves only with their nearest neighbours, and that the system is at a given temperature {{mvar|T}}. The strength of their interaction is quantified by a certain [[coupling constant|coupling]] {{mvar|J}}. The physics of the system will be described by a certain formula, say the hamiltonian {{math|''H(T,J)''}}.\n\nNow proceed to divide the solid into '''blocks''' of 2\u00d72&nbsp;squares; we attempt to describe the system in terms of '''block variables''', i.e., variables which describe the average behavior of the block. Further assume that,  by some lucky coincidence, the physics of block variables is described by a ''formula of the same kind'', but with '''different''' values for {{mvar|T}} and  {{mvar|J}} :  {{math|'' H(T',J')''.}} (This isn't exactly true, in general, but it is often a good first approximation.)\n\nPerhaps, the initial problem was too hard to solve, since there were too many atoms. Now, in the '''renormalized''' problem we have only one fourth of them. But why stop now? Another iteration of the same kind leads to  {{math|''H(T\",J\")''}}, and only one sixteenth of the atoms. We are increasing the '''observation scale''' with each RG step.\n\nOf course, the best idea is to iterate until there is only one very big block. Since the number of atoms in any real sample of material is very large, this is more or less equivalent to finding the ''long range'' behaviour of the RG transformation which took  {{math|''(T,J) \u2192 (T',J')''}} and  {{math|''(T',J')\u2192 (T\",J\")''}}. Often, when iterated many times, this RG transformation leads to a certain number of '''fixed points'''.\n\nTo be more concrete, consider a [[magnetic]] system (e.g., the [[Ising model]]), in which the {{mvar|J}} coupling  denotes the trend of neighbour [[spin (physics)|spin]]s to be parallel. The configuration of the system is the result of  the tradeoff between the ordering {{mvar|J}}  term and the disordering effect of temperature.\n\nFor many models of this kind there are three fixed points: \n#  {{mvar|T}}=0 and  {{mvar|J}} \u2192 \u221e. This means that, at the largest size, temperature becomes unimportant, i.e., the disordering factor vanishes. Thus, in large scales, the system appears to be ordered. We are in a [[ferromagnetic]] phase.\n#  {{mvar|T}} \u2192 \u221e and {{mvar|J}} \u2192 0. Exactly the opposite; here,  temperature dominates, and the system is disordered at large scales.\n# A nontrivial point between them,  {{mvar|T}} = {{mvar|T}}<sub>''c''</sub> and  {{mvar|J}} = {{mvar|J}}<sub>''c''</sub>. In this point, changing the scale does not change the physics, because the system is in a [[fractal]] state. It corresponds to the [[Curie point|Curie]] [[phase transition]], and is also called a [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]].\n\nSo, if we are given a certain material with given values of  {{mvar|T}} and {{mvar|J}}, all we have to do in order to find out the large-scale behaviour of the system is to iterate the pair until we find the corresponding fixed point.\n\n==Elementary theory<!--'RG flow' redirects here-->==\nIn more technical terms, let us assume that we have a theory described by a certain function <math>Z</math> of the [[state variables]] <math>\\{s_i\\}</math> and a certain set of coupling constants <math>\\{J_k\\}</math>. This function may be a [[partition function (quantum field theory)|partition function]], an [[Action (physics)|action]], a [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]], etc. It must contain the whole description of the physics of the system.\n\nNow we consider a certain blocking transformation of the state variables <math>\\{s_i\\}\\to \\{\\tilde s_i\\}</math>, the number of <math>\\tilde s_i</math> must be lower than the number of <math>s_i</math>. Now let us try to rewrite the <math>Z</math> function ''only'' in terms of the <math>\\tilde s_i</math>. If this is achievable by a certain change in the parameters, <math>\\{J_k\\}\\to \\{\\tilde J_k\\}</math>, then the theory is said to be '''renormalizable'''.\n\nFor some reason, most fundamental theories of physics such as [[quantum electrodynamics]], [[quantum chromodynamics]] and [[Electroweak force|electro-weak]] interaction, but not gravity, are exactly renormalizable. Also, most theories in condensed matter physics are approximately renormalizable, from [[superconductivity]] to fluid turbulence.\n\nThe change in the parameters is implemented by a certain beta function: <math>\\{\\tilde J_k\\}=\\beta(\\{ J_k \\})</math>, which is said to induce a '''renormalization flow''' (or '''RG flow''') on the <math>J</math>-space. The values of <math>J</math> under the flow are called '''running couplings'''.\n\nAs was stated in the previous section, the most important information in the RG flow are its '''fixed points'''. The possible macroscopic states of the system, at a large scale, are given by this set of fixed points. If these fixed points correspond to a free field theory, the theory is said to exhibit [[quantum triviality]], possessing what is called a [[Landau pole]], as in quantum electrodynamics.  For a {{mvar|\u03c6}}<sup>4</sup> interaction, [[Michael Aizenman]] proved that this theory is indeed trivial, for space-time dimension {{mvar|D}} \u2265 5.<ref name=\"Aiz81\">{{cite journal |last=Aizenman |first=M. |authorlink=Michael Aizenman |year=1981 |title=Proof of the triviality of ''\u03d5{{su|b=d|p=4}}'' field theory and some mean-field features of Ising models for ''d'' > 4  |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=1\u20134 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.47.1 |bibcode=1981PhRvL..47....1A }}</ref> For {{mvar|D}} = 4, the triviality has yet to be proven rigorously (pending [https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07973 recent submission to the arxiv]), but [[Quantum triviality|lattice computations]] have provided strong evidence for this.  This fact is important as [[quantum triviality]] can be used to bound or even ''predict'' parameters such as the [[Higgs boson]] mass in [[Physics applications of asymptotically safe gravity#The mass of the Higgs boson|asymptotic safety]] scenarios.

Thus, in such lossy systems, the renormalization group is, in fact, a [[semigroup]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n==Relevant and irrelevant operators and universality classes==<!-- This section is linked from [[Power law]] -->\n\n{{See also|Universality class| Dangerously irrelevant operator|Phase transition#Critical exponents and universality classes|Scale invariance#CFT description}}\n\nConsider a certain observable {{mvar|A}} of a physical system undergoing an RG transformation. The magnitude of the observable as the length scale of the system goes from small to large may be: (a) always increasing, (b) always decreasing or (c) other. In the first case, the observable is said to be a '''relevant''' observable; in the second, '''irrelevant''' and in the third, '''marginal'''.\n\nA relevant observable is needed to describe the macroscopic behaviour of the system; an irrelevant observable is not. Marginal observables\nmay or may not need  be taken into account. A remarkable broad fact is that ''most observables are irrelevant'', i.e.,  ''the macroscopic physics is dominated by only a few observables in most systems''.    As an example, in microscopic physics, to describe a system consisting of a [[Mole (unit)|mole]] of carbon-12 atoms we need of the order of 10<sup>23</sup> ([[Avogadro constant|Avogadro's number]]) variables, while to describe it as a macroscopic system (12 grams of carbon-12) we only need a few.\n\nBefore Wilson's RG approach, there was an astonishing empirical fact to explain: the coincidence of the [[critical exponents]] (i.e., the exponents of the reduced-temperature dependence of several quantities near a [[second order phase transition]]) in very disparate phenomena, such as magnetic systems, superfluid transition ([[Lambda transition]]), alloy physics, etc. Thus, in general, thermodynamic features of a system near a phase transition ''depend only on a small number of variables'', such as dimensionality and symmetry, but are insensitive to details of the underlying microscopic properties of the system.\n\nThis coincidence of critical exponents for ostensibly quite different physical systems is called [[universality (dynamical systems)|universality]]\u2212\u2212and is now successfully explained by the RG: essentially by showing that the differences  among all such phenomena are, in fact, traceable to such '''irrelevant observables''', while the relevant observables are shared in common.\n\nThus, many macroscopic phenomena may be grouped into a small set of '''[[universality class]]es''', specified by the shared sets of relevant observables.{{efn|A superb, albeit technical, exposition by [[:de:Jean Zinn-Justin|J. Zinn-Justin]] (2010) is the classic article {{cite journal |title=Critical Phenomena: field theoretical approach |journal=Scholarpedia|year=2010 |doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.8346 |last1=Zinn-Justin |first1=Jean |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=8346 |bibcode=2010SchpJ...5.8346Z |doi-access=free }}. For example, for Ising-like systems with a \u2124<sub>2</sub> symmetry or, more generally, for models with an ''O(N)'' symmetry, the Gaussian (free) fixed point is long-distance stable above space dimension four, marginally stable in dimension four, and unstable below dimension four.  See [[Quantum triviality]].}}\n\n==Momentum space==\nRenormalization groups, in practice, come in two main \"flavours\". The Kadanoff picture explained above refers mainly to the so-called '''real-space RG'''.\n\n'''Momentum-space RG''' on the other hand, has a longer history despite its relative subtlety.  It can be used for systems where the degrees of freedom can be cast in terms of the [[Fourier modes]] of a given field. The RG transformation proceeds by ''integrating out'' a certain set of high-momentum (large-wavenumber) modes. Since large wavenumbers are related to short-length scales, the momentum-space RG results in an essentially analogous coarse-graining effect as with real-space RG.\n\nMomentum-space RG is usually performed on a [[perturbation theory|perturbation]] expansion. The validity of such an expansion is predicated upon the actual physics of a system being close to that of a [[free field]] system. In this case, one may calculate observables by summing the leading terms in the expansion. \nThis approach has proved  successful for many theories, including most of particle physics, but fails for systems whose physics is very far from any free system, i.e., systems with strong correlations.\n\nAs an example of the physical meaning of RG in particle physics,  consider an overview of ''charge renormalization'' in [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED). Suppose we have a point positive charge of a certain true (or '''bare''') magnitude. The electromagnetic field around it has a certain energy, and thus may produce some pairs of (e.g.) electrons-positrons, which will be annihilated very quickly. But, in their short life, the electron will be attracted by the charge, and the positron will be repelled. Since this happens continuously, these pairs are effectively '''screening''' the charge from abroad. Thus, the measured strength of the charge will depend on how close to our probes it may enter. Hence a ''dependence of a certain coupling constant (here, the electric charge) with distance scale''.\n\nMomentum and length scales are related inversely, according to the  [[de Broglie relation]]: the higher the energy or momentum scale we may reach, the lower the length scale we may probe and resolve. Therefore, the momentum-space RG practitioners sometimes declaim to ''integrate out'' high momenta or high energy from their theories.\n\n==Exact renormalization group equations==\nAn '''exact renormalization group equation''' ('''ERGE''') is one that takes [[irrelevant]] couplings into account. There  are several formulations.\n\nThe '''Wilson ERGE''' is the simplest conceptually,  but is practically impossible to implement. [[Fourier transform]] into [[momentum space]] after [[Wick rotation|Wick rotating]] into [[Euclidean space]]. Insist upon a hard momentum [[Cutoff (physics)|cutoff]], {{math|''p''<sup>2</sup> \u2264 ''\u039b''<sup>2</sup>}} so that the only degrees of freedom are those with momenta less than {{mvar|\u039b}}. The [[partition function (quantum field theory)|partition function]] is\n:<math>Z=\\int_{p^2\\leq \\Lambda^2} \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\exp\\left[-S_\\Lambda[\\phi]\\right].</math>\n\nFor any positive  {{mvar|\u039b'}} less than  {{mvar|\u039b}}, define {{math|''S<sub>\u039b'</sub>''}} (a functional over field configurations  {{mvar|\u03c6}} whose Fourier transform has momentum support within {{math|''p''<sup>2</sup> \u2264 ''\u039b' ''<sup>2</sup>}}) as\n:<math>\\exp\\left(-S_{\\Lambda'}[\\phi]\\right)\\ \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\  \\int_{\\Lambda'  \\leq p \\leq \\Lambda} \\mathcal{D}\\phi   \\exp\\left[-S_\\Lambda[\\phi]\\right].</math>\n\nObviously,\n:<math>Z=\\int_{p^2\\leq {\\Lambda'}^2}\\mathcal{D}\\phi \\exp\\left[-S_{\\Lambda'}[\\phi]\\right].</math>\n\nIn fact, this transformation is [[transitive relation|transitive]]. If you compute  {{math|''S<sub>\u039b\u2032</sub>''}} from  {{math|''S<sub>\u039b</sub>''}} and then compute S<sub>\u039b&Prime;</sub> from S<sub>\u039b\u2032</sub>, this gives you the same Wilsonian action as computing S<sub>\u039b&Prime;</sub> directly from S<sub>\u039b</sub>.\n\nThe '''Polchinski ERGE''' involves a [[smooth function|smooth]] UV [[regularization (physics)|regulator]] [[Cutoff (physics)|cutoff]]. Basically, the idea is an improvement over the Wilson ERGE. Instead of a sharp momentum cutoff, it uses a smooth cutoff. Essentially, we suppress contributions from momenta greater than  {{mvar|\u039b}} heavily. The smoothness of the cutoff, however, allows us to derive a functional [[differential equation]] in the cutoff scale  {{mvar|\u039b}}. As in Wilson's approach, we have a different action functional for each cutoff energy scale  {{mvar|\u039b}}. Each of these actions are supposed to describe exactly the same model which means that their [[partition function (quantum field theory)|partition functional]]s have to match exactly.\n\nIn other words, (for a real scalar field; generalizations to other fields are obvious),\n:<math>Z_\\Lambda[J]=\\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\exp\\left(-S_\\Lambda[\\phi]+J\\cdot \\phi\\right)=\\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\exp\\left(-\\tfrac{1}{2}\\phi\\cdot R_\\Lambda \\cdot \\phi-S_{\\text{int}\\,\\Lambda}[\\phi]+J\\cdot\\phi\\right)</math>\n\nand Z<sub>\u039b</sub> is really independent of {{mvar|\u039b}}! We have used the condensed [[deWitt notation]] here. We have also split the bare action S<sub>\u039b</sub> into a quadratic kinetic part and an interacting part S<sub>int \u039b</sub>. This split most certainly isn't clean. The \"interacting\" part can very well also contain quadratic kinetic terms. In fact, if there is any [[wave function renormalization]], it most certainly will. This can be somewhat reduced by introducing field rescalings. R<sub>\u039b</sub> is a function of the momentum p and the second term in the exponent is\n:<math>\\frac{1}{2}\\int \\frac{d^dp}{(2\\pi)^d}\\tilde{\\phi}^*(p)R_\\Lambda(p)\\tilde{\\phi}(p)</math>\nwhen expanded.\n\nWhen <math>p \\ll \\Lambda</math>, {{math|''R''<sub>\u039b</sub>(''p'')/''p''<sup>2</sup>}} is essentially 1. When <math>p \\gg \\Lambda</math>, {{math|''R''<sub>\u039b</sub>(''p'')/''p''<sup>2</sup>}} becomes very very huge and approaches infinity. {{math|''R''<sub>\u039b</sub>(''p'')/''p''<sup>2</sup>}} is always greater than or equal to 1 and is smooth. Basically, this leaves the fluctuations with momenta less than the cutoff {{mvar|\u039b}} unaffected but heavily suppresses contributions from fluctuations with momenta greater than the cutoff. This is obviously a huge improvement over Wilson.\n\nThe condition that\n:<math>\\frac{d}{d\\Lambda}Z_\\Lambda=0</math>\ncan be satisfied by (but not only by)\n:<math>\\frac{d}{d\\Lambda}S_{\\text{int}\\,\\Lambda}=\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\delta S_{\\text{int}\\,\\Lambda}}{\\delta \\phi}\\cdot \\left(\\frac{d}{d\\Lambda}R_\\Lambda^{-1}\\right)\\cdot \\frac{\\delta S_{\\text{int}\\,\\Lambda}}{\\delta \\phi}-\\frac{1}{2}\\operatorname{Tr}\\left[\\frac{\\delta^2 S_{\\text{int}\\,\\Lambda}}{\\delta \\phi\\, \\delta \\phi}\\cdot R_\\Lambda^{-1}\\right].</math>\n\n[[Jacques Distler]] claimed without proof that this ERGE is not correct [[nonperturbative]]ly.<ref>{{cite web |author-link=Jacques Distler |first=Jacques |last=Distler |url=http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000648.html |title=000648.html  |website=golem.ph.utexas.edu}}</ref>\n\nThe '''effective average action ERGE''' involves a smooth IR regulator cutoff. \nThe idea is to take all fluctuations right up to an IR scale {{mvar|k}} into account.  The '''effective average action''' will be accurate for fluctuations with momenta larger than {{mvar|k}}. As the parameter {{mvar|k}} is lowered, the effective average action approaches the [[effective action]] which includes all quantum and classical fluctuations. In contrast, for large {{mvar|k}} the effective average action is close to the \"bare action\". So, the effective average action interpolates between the \"bare action\" and the [[effective action]].\n\nFor a real [[scalar field]], one adds an IR cutoff\n:<math>\\frac{1}{2}\\int \\frac{d^dp}{(2\\pi)^d} \\tilde{\\phi}^*(p)R_k(p)\\tilde{\\phi}(p)</math>\nto the [[action (physics)|action]]  {{mvar|S}}, where R<sub>k</sub> is a function of both  {{mvar|k}} and  {{mvar|p}} such that for \n<math>p \\gg k</math>, R<sub>k</sub>(p) is very tiny and approaches 0 and for <math>p \\ll k</math>, <math>R_k(p)\\gtrsim k^2</math>. R<sub>k</sub> is both smooth and nonnegative. Its large value for small momenta leads to a suppression of their contribution to the partition function which is effectively the same thing as neglecting large-scale fluctuations.\n\nOne can use the condensed [[deWitt notation]]\n:<math>\\frac{1}{2} \\phi\\cdot R_k \\cdot \\phi</math>\nfor this IR regulator.\n\nSo,\n:<math>\\exp\\left(W_k[J]\\right)=Z_k[J]=\\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\exp\\left(-S[\\phi]-\\frac{1}{2}\\phi \\cdot R_k \\cdot \\phi +J\\cdot\\phi\\right)</math>\nwhere  {{mvar|J}} is the [[source field]]. The [[Legendre transform]] of W<sub>k</sub> ordinarily gives the [[effective action]]. However, the action that we started off with is really S[\u03c6]+1/2 \u03c6\u22c5R<sub>k</sub>\u22c5\u03c6 and so, to get the effective average action, we subtract off 1/2 \u03c6\u22c5R<sub>k</sub>\u22c5\u03c6. In other words,\n:<math>\\phi[J;k]=\\frac{\\delta W_k}{\\delta J}[J]</math>\ncan be inverted to give J<sub>k</sub>[\u03c6] and we define the effective average action \u0393<sub>k</sub> as\n:<math>\\Gamma_k[\\phi]\\ \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\  \\left(-W\\left[J_k[\\phi]\\right]+J_k[\\phi]\\cdot\\phi\\right)-\\tfrac{1}{2}\\phi\\cdot R_k\\cdot \\phi.</math>\n\nHence,\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\frac{d}{dk}\\Gamma_k[\\phi] &=-\\frac{d}{dk}W_k[J_k[\\phi]]-\\frac{\\delta W_k}{\\delta J}\\cdot\\frac{d}{dk}J_k[\\phi]+\\frac{d}{dk}J_k[\\phi]\\cdot \\phi-\\tfrac{1}{2}\\phi\\cdot \\frac{d}{dk}R_k \\cdot \\phi \\\\\n&=-\\frac{d}{dk}W_k[J_k[\\phi]]-\\tfrac{1}{2}\\phi\\cdot \\frac{d}{dk}R_k \\cdot \\phi \\\\\n&=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\left\\langle\\phi \\cdot \\frac{d}{dk}R_k \\cdot \\phi\\right\\rangle_{J_k[\\phi];k}-\\tfrac{1}{2}\\phi\\cdot \\frac{d}{dk}R_k \\cdot \\phi \\\\\n&=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\operatorname{Tr}\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\delta J_k}{\\delta \\phi}\\right)^{-1}\\cdot\\frac{d}{dk}R_k\\right] \\\\\n&=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\operatorname{Tr}\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\delta^2 \\Gamma_k}{\\delta \\phi \\delta \\phi}+R_k\\right)^{-1}\\cdot\\frac{d}{dk}R_k\\right]\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nthus\n:<math>\\frac{d}{dk}\\Gamma_k[\\phi] =\\tfrac{1}{2}\\operatorname{Tr}\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\delta^2 \\Gamma_k}{\\delta \\phi \\delta \\phi}+R_k\\right)^{-1}\\cdot\\frac{d}{dk}R_k\\right]</math>\nis the ERGE which is also known as the [[Christof Wetterich|Wetterich]] equation.

Polchinski's version is certainly much closer to Wilson's idea in spirit.

In [[particle physics]], it reflects the changes in the underlying force laws (codified in a [[quantum field theory]]) as  the energy scale at which physical processes occur varies, energy/momentum  and resolution distance scales being effectively conjugate under the [[uncertainty principle]].\n\nA change in scale is called a [[Scale invariance|scale transformation]].  The renormalization group is intimately related to ''scale invariance'' and ''conformal invariance'', symmetries in which a system appears the same at all scales (so-called [[self-similarity]]).{{efn|Note that [[Scale invariance|scale transformations]] are a strict subset of [[Conformal symmetry|conformal transformations]], in general, the latter including additional symmetry generators associated with [[special conformal transformation]]s.}}\n\nAs the scale varies, it is as if one is changing the magnifying power of a notional microscope viewing the system. In so-called renormalizable theories, the system at one scale will generally be seen to consist of self-similar copies of itself when viewed at a smaller scale, with different parameters describing the components of the system. The components, or fundamental variables, may  relate to atoms, elementary particles, atomic spins, etc.  The parameters of the theory typically describe the interactions of the components. These may be variable [[coupling constant|couplings]] which measure the strength of various forces, or mass parameters themselves. The components themselves may appear to be composed of more of the self-same components as one goes to shorter distances.\n\nFor example, in [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED), an electron appears to be composed of electrons, positrons (anti-electrons) and photons, as one views it at higher resolution, at very short distances. The electron at such short distances has a slightly different electric charge than does the [[dressed particle|dressed electron]] seen at large distances, and this change, or ''running'', in the value of the electric charge is determined by the renormalization group equation.\n\n==History==<!--'History of renormalization group theory' redirects here-->\nThe idea of scale transformations and scale invariance is old in physics: Scaling arguments were commonplace for the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean school]], [[Euclid]], and up to [[Galileo]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.av8n.com/physics/scaling.htm |title=Introduction to Scaling Laws |website=av8n.com}}</ref> They became popular again at the end of the 19th&nbsp;century, perhaps the first example being the idea of enhanced [[viscosity]] of [[Osborne Reynolds]], as a way to explain turbulence.\n\nThe renormalization group was initially devised in particle physics, but nowadays its applications extend to [[solid-state physics]], [[fluid mechanics]], [[physical cosmology]], and even [[nanotechnology]]. An early article<ref>{{cite journal |author1-link=Ernst Stueckelberg |last=Stueckelberg |first=E.C.G. |author2-link=Andr\u00e9 Petermann |first2=A. |last2=Petermann |year=1953 |url=https://www.e-periodica.ch/cntmng?pid=hpa-001:1953:26::894 |title=La renormalisation des constants dans la th\u00e9orie de quanta |journal=Helv.

Stueckelberg and Petermann opened the field conceptually. They noted that [[renormalization]] exhibits a group of transformations which transfer quantities from the bare terms to the counter terms. They introduced a function ''h''(''e'') in [[Quantum electrodynamics| quantum electrodynamics (QED)]], which is now called the [[Beta-function#Quantum electrodynamics|beta function]] (see below).\n\n===Beginnings===\n[[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[Francis E. Low]] restricted the idea to scale transformations in QED in 1954,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gell-Mann |first=M. |authorlink=Murray Gell-Mann |author2=Low, F. E. |authorlink2=Francis E.

They determined the variation of the electromagnetic coupling in QED, by appreciating the simplicity of the scaling structure of that theory. They thus discovered that the coupling parameter ''g''(''\u03bc'') at the energy scale ''\u03bc'' is effectively given by the group equation\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =:\n|equation =  <math>g(\\mu)=G^{-1}\\left(\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{M}\\right)^d G(g(M))\\right)</math>,\n|cellpadding= 6\n|border\n|border colour = #0073CF\n|bgcolor=#F9FFF7}}\nfor some function ''G'' (unspecified\u2014nowadays called [[Franz Wegner|Wegner]]'s scaling function) and a constant ''d'', in terms of the coupling ''g(M)'' at a reference scale ''M''.\n\nGell-Mann and Low realized in these results that the effective scale can be arbitrarily taken as ''\u03bc'', and can vary to define the theory at any other scale:\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =:\n|equation =  <math>g(\\kappa)=G^{-1}\\left(\\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{\\mu}\\right)^d G(g(\\mu))\\right) = G^{-1}\\left(\\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{M}\\right)^d G(g(M))\\right)</math>.\n|cellpadding= 6\n|border\n|border colour = #0073CF\n|bgcolor=#F9FFF7}}\nThe gist of the RG is this group property: as the scale ''\u03bc'' varies, the theory presents a self-similar replica of itself, and any scale can be accessed similarly from any other scale, by group action, a formal transitive conjugacy of couplings<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Curtright |first1=T.L. |authorlink1=Thomas Curtright |last2=Zachos |first2=C.K. |date=March 2011 |title=Renormalization Group Functional Equations |journal=Physical Review D |volume=83 |issue=6 |pages=065019 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.83.065019 |bibcode=2011PhRvD..83f5019C |arxiv=1010.5174}}</ref> in the mathematical sense ([[Schr\u00f6der's equation]]).\n\nOn the basis of this (finite) group equation and its scaling property, Gell-Mann and Low could then focus on infinitesimal transformations, and invented a computational method based on a mathematical flow function {{math|''\u03c8''(''g'') {{=}} ''G'' ''d''/(\u2202''G''/\u2202''g'')}} of the coupling parameter ''g'', which they introduced. Like the function ''h''(''e'') of Stueckelberg and Petermann, their function determines the differential change of the coupling ''g''(''\u03bc'') with respect to a small change in energy scale ''\u03bc'' through a differential equation, the ''renormalization group equation'':\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =:\n|equation =  <math> \\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\ln\\mu} = \\psi(g) = \\beta(g) </math>.\n|cellpadding= 6\n|border\n|border colour = #0073CF\n|bgcolor=#F9FFF7}}\n\nThe modern name is also indicated, the [[Beta function (physics)|beta function]], introduced by [[Curtis Callan|C. Callan]] and [[Kurt Symanzik|K. Symanzik]] in 1970.<ref name=CS/> Since it is a mere function of ''g'', integration in ''g'' of a perturbative estimate of it permits specification of the renormalization trajectory of the coupling, that is, its variation with energy, effectively the function ''G'' in this perturbative approximation. The renormalization group prediction (cf. Stueckelberg\u2013Petermann and Gell-Mann\u2013Low works) was confirmed 40&nbsp;years later at the [[LEP]] accelerator experiments: the [[Fine-structure constant|fine structure \"constant\"]] of QED was measured to be about {{frac|1|127}} at energies close to 200&nbsp;GeV, as opposed to the standard low-energy physics value of {{frac|1|137}}&nbsp;.{{efn|Early applications to [[quantum electrodynamics]] are discussed in the influential 1959 book ''The Theory of Quantized Fields'' by [[Nikolay Bogolyubov]] and [[Dmitry Shirkov]].<ref>{{cite book |author1-link=Nikolay Bogolyubov |first1=N.N. |last1=Bogoliubov |author2-link=Dmitry Shirkov |first2=D.V. |last2=Shirkov |year=1959 |title=The Theory of Quantized Fields |place=New York, NY |publisher=Interscience}}</ref>}}\n\n=== Deeper understanding ===\nThe renormalization group emerges from the [[renormalization]] of the quantum field variables, which normally has to address the problem of infinities in a quantum field theory.{{efn|Although note that the RG exists independently of the infinities.}} This problem of systematically handling the infinities of quantum field theory to obtain finite physical quantities was solved for QED by [[Richard Feynman]], [[Julian Schwinger]] and [[Shin'ichir\u014d Tomonaga]], who received the 1965 Nobel prize for these contributions. They effectively devised the theory of mass and charge renormalization, in which the infinity in the momentum scale is [[Cutoff (physics)|cut off]] by an ultra-large [[Regularization (physics)|regulator]], \u039b.{{efn|The regulator parameter \u039b could ultimately be taken to be infinite \u2013 infinities reflect the pileup of contributions from an infinity of degrees of freedom at infinitely high energy scales.}}\n\nThe dependence of physical quantities, such as the electric charge or electron mass, on the scale \u039b is hidden, effectively swapped for the longer-distance scales at which the physical quantities are measured, and, as a result, all observable quantities end up being finite instead, even for an infinite \u039b. Gell-Mann and Low thus realized in these results that, infinitesimally, while a tiny change in '' g'' is provided by the above RG equation given \u03c8(''g''), the self-similarity is expressed by the fact that \u03c8(''g'') depends explicitly only upon the parameter(s) of the theory, and not upon the scale ''\u03bc''. Consequently, the above renormalization group equation may be solved for (''G'' and thus) ''g''(''\u03bc'').\n\nA deeper understanding of the physical meaning and generalization of the renormalization process, which goes beyond the dilation group of conventional ''renormalizable'' theories, considers  methods where widely different scales of lengths appear simultaneously. It came from [[condensed matter physics]]: [[Leo P. Kadanoff]]'s paper in 1966 proposed the \"block-spin\" renormalization group.<ref name=Kadanoff>{{cite journal |author-link=Leo P.

Applications of the RG to particle physics exploded in number in the 1970s with the establishment of the [[Standard Model]].\n\nIn 1973,<ref>{{cite journal |first1=D.J. |last1=Gross |first2=F. |last2=Wilczek |year=1973 |title=Ultraviolet behavior of non-Abelian gauge theories |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=30 |issue= 26 |pages=1343\u20131346  |bibcode=1973PhRvL..30.1343G |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.30.1343|doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=H.D. |last=Politzer |year=1973 |title=Reliable perturbative results for strong interactions |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]  |volume=30 |issue=26 |pages=1346\u20131349 |bibcode=1973PhRvL..30.1346P  |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.30.1346|doi-access=free }}</ref> it was discovered that a theory of interacting colored quarks, called [[quantum chromodynamics]], had a negative beta function. This means that an initial high-energy value of the coupling will eventuate a special value of ''\u03bc'' at which the coupling blows up (diverges). This special value is the [[Strong coupling constant#QCD and asymptotic freedom|scale of the strong interactions]], [[Coupling constant#QCD scale|''\u03bc'' = \u039b<sub>QCD</sub>]] and occurs at about 200&nbsp;MeV. Conversely, the coupling becomes weak at very high energies ([[asymptotic freedom]]), and the quarks become observable as point-like particles, in [[deep inelastic scattering]], as anticipated by Feynman-Bjorken scaling. QCD was thereby established as the quantum field theory controlling the strong interactions of particles.\n\nMomentum space RG also became a highly developed tool in solid state physics, but its success was hindered by the extensive use of perturbation theory, which prevented the theory from reaching success in strongly correlated systems. In order to study these strongly correlated systems, [[Calculus of variations|variational]] approaches are a better alternative.\n\n=== Conformal symmetry ===\nThe conformal symmetry is associated with the vanishing of the beta function.

Kadanoff]] in 1966.<ref name=Kadanoff/>\n\nConsider a 2{{mvar|D}} solid, a set of atoms in a perfect square array, as depicted in the figure.\n\n[[File:Rgkadanoff.png|180px]]\n\nAssume that atoms interact among themselves only with their nearest neighbours, and that the system is at a given temperature {{mvar|T}}. The strength of their interaction is quantified by a certain [[coupling constant|coupling]] {{mvar|J}}. The physics of the system will be described by a certain formula, say the hamiltonian {{math|''H(T,J)''}}.\n\nNow proceed to divide the solid into '''blocks''' of 2\u00d72&nbsp;squares; we attempt to describe the system in terms of '''block variables''', i.e., variables which describe the average behavior of the block. Further assume that,  by some lucky coincidence, the physics of block variables is described by a ''formula of the same kind'', but with '''different''' values for {{mvar|T}} and  {{mvar|J}} :  {{math|'' H(T',J')''.}} (This isn't exactly true, in general, but it is often a good first approximation.)\n\nPerhaps, the initial problem was too hard to solve, since there were too many atoms. Now, in the '''renormalized''' problem we have only one fourth of them. But why stop now? Another iteration of the same kind leads to  {{math|''H(T\",J\")''}}, and only one sixteenth of the atoms. We are increasing the '''observation scale''' with each RG step.\n\nOf course, the best idea is to iterate until there is only one very big block. Since the number of atoms in any real sample of material is very large, this is more or less equivalent to finding the ''long range'' behaviour of the RG transformation which took  {{math|''(T,J) \u2192 (T',J')''}} and  {{math|''(T',J')\u2192 (T\",J\")''}}. Often, when iterated many times, this RG transformation leads to a certain number of '''fixed points'''.\n\nTo be more concrete, consider a [[magnetic]] system (e.g., the [[Ising model]]), in which the {{mvar|J}} coupling  denotes the trend of neighbour [[spin (physics)|spin]]s to be parallel. The configuration of the system is the result of  the tradeoff between the ordering {{mvar|J}}  term and the disordering effect of temperature.\n\nFor many models of this kind there are three fixed points: \n#  {{mvar|T}}=0 and  {{mvar|J}} \u2192 \u221e. This means that, at the largest size, temperature becomes unimportant, i.e., the disordering factor vanishes. Thus, in large scales, the system appears to be ordered. We are in a [[ferromagnetic]] phase.\n#  {{mvar|T}} \u2192 \u221e and {{mvar|J}} \u2192 0. Exactly the opposite; here,  temperature dominates, and the system is disordered at large scales.\n# A nontrivial point between them,  {{mvar|T}} = {{mvar|T}}<sub>''c''</sub> and  {{mvar|J}} = {{mvar|J}}<sub>''c''</sub>. In this point, changing the scale does not change the physics, because the system is in a [[fractal]] state. It corresponds to the [[Curie point|Curie]] [[phase transition]], and is also called a [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]].\n\nSo, if we are given a certain material with given values of  {{mvar|T}} and {{mvar|J}}, all we have to do in order to find out the large-scale behaviour of the system is to iterate the pair until we find the corresponding fixed point.\n\n==Elementary theory<!--'RG flow' redirects here-->==\nIn more technical terms, let us assume that we have a theory described by a certain function <math>Z</math> of the [[state variables]] <math>\\{s_i\\}</math> and a certain set of coupling constants <math>\\{J_k\\}</math>. This function may be a [[partition function (quantum field theory)|partition function]], an [[Action (physics)|action]], a [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]], etc. It must contain the whole description of the physics of the system.\n\nNow we consider a certain blocking transformation of the state variables <math>\\{s_i\\}\\to \\{\\tilde s_i\\}</math>, the number of <math>\\tilde s_i</math> must be lower than the number of <math>s_i</math>. Now let us try to rewrite the <math>Z</math> function ''only'' in terms of the <math>\\tilde s_i</math>. If this is achievable by a certain change in the parameters, <math>\\{J_k\\}\\to \\{\\tilde J_k\\}</math>, then the theory is said to be '''renormalizable'''.\n\nFor some reason, most fundamental theories of physics such as [[quantum electrodynamics]], [[quantum chromodynamics]] and [[Electroweak force|electro-weak]] interaction, but not gravity, are exactly renormalizable. Also, most theories in condensed matter physics are approximately renormalizable, from [[superconductivity]] to fluid turbulence.\n\nThe change in the parameters is implemented by a certain beta function: <math>\\{\\tilde J_k\\}=\\beta(\\{ J_k \\})</math>, which is said to induce a '''renormalization flow''' (or '''RG flow''') on the <math>J</math>-space. The values of <math>J</math> under the flow are called '''running couplings'''.\n\nAs was stated in the previous section, the most important information in the RG flow are its '''fixed points'''. The possible macroscopic states of the system, at a large scale, are given by this set of fixed points. If these fixed points correspond to a free field theory, the theory is said to exhibit [[quantum triviality]], possessing what is called a [[Landau pole]], as in quantum electrodynamics.  For a {{mvar|\u03c6}}<sup>4</sup> interaction, [[Michael Aizenman]] proved that this theory is indeed trivial, for space-time dimension {{mvar|D}} \u2265 5.<ref name=\"Aiz81\">{{cite journal |last=Aizenman |first=M. |authorlink=Michael Aizenman |year=1981 |title=Proof of the triviality of ''\u03d5{{su|b=d|p=4}}'' field theory and some mean-field features of Ising models for ''d'' > 4  |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=1\u20134 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.47.1 |bibcode=1981PhRvL..47....1A }}</ref> For {{mvar|D}} = 4, the triviality has yet to be proven rigorously (pending [https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07973 recent submission to the arxiv]), but [[Quantum triviality|lattice computations]] have provided strong evidence for this.  This fact is important as [[quantum triviality]] can be used to bound or even ''predict'' parameters such as the [[Higgs boson]] mass in [[Physics applications of asymptotically safe gravity#The mass of the Higgs boson|asymptotic safety]] scenarios.

Thus, in such lossy systems, the renormalization group is, in fact, a [[semigroup]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n==Relevant and irrelevant operators and universality classes==<!-- This section is linked from [[Power law]] -->\n\n{{See also|Universality class| Dangerously irrelevant operator|Phase transition#Critical exponents and universality classes|Scale invariance#CFT description}}\n\nConsider a certain observable {{mvar|A}} of a physical system undergoing an RG transformation. The magnitude of the observable as the length scale of the system goes from small to large may be: (a) always increasing, (b) always decreasing or (c) other. In the first case, the observable is said to be a '''relevant''' observable; in the second, '''irrelevant''' and in the third, '''marginal'''.\n\nA relevant observable is needed to describe the macroscopic behaviour of the system; an irrelevant observable is not. Marginal observables\nmay or may not need  be taken into account. A remarkable broad fact is that ''most observables are irrelevant'', i.e.,  ''the macroscopic physics is dominated by only a few observables in most systems''.    As an example, in microscopic physics, to describe a system consisting of a [[Mole (unit)|mole]] of carbon-12 atoms we need of the order of 10<sup>23</sup> ([[Avogadro constant|Avogadro's number]]) variables, while to describe it as a macroscopic system (12 grams of carbon-12) we only need a few.\n\nBefore Wilson's RG approach, there was an astonishing empirical fact to explain: the coincidence of the [[critical exponents]] (i.e., the exponents of the reduced-temperature dependence of several quantities near a [[second order phase transition]]) in very disparate phenomena, such as magnetic systems, superfluid transition ([[Lambda transition]]), alloy physics, etc. Thus, in general, thermodynamic features of a system near a phase transition ''depend only on a small number of variables'', such as dimensionality and symmetry, but are insensitive to details of the underlying microscopic properties of the system.\n\nThis coincidence of critical exponents for ostensibly quite different physical systems is called [[universality (dynamical systems)|universality]]\u2212\u2212and is now successfully explained by the RG: essentially by showing that the differences  among all such phenomena are, in fact, traceable to such '''irrelevant observables''', while the relevant observables are shared in common.\n\nThus, many macroscopic phenomena may be grouped into a small set of '''[[universality class]]es''', specified by the shared sets of relevant observables.{{efn|A superb, albeit technical, exposition by [[:de:Jean Zinn-Justin|J. Zinn-Justin]] (2010) is the classic article {{cite journal |title=Critical Phenomena: field theoretical approach |journal=Scholarpedia|year=2010 |doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.8346 |last1=Zinn-Justin |first1=Jean |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=8346 |bibcode=2010SchpJ...5.8346Z |doi-access=free }}. For example, for Ising-like systems with a \u2124<sub>2</sub> symmetry or, more generally, for models with an ''O(N)'' symmetry, the Gaussian (free) fixed point is long-distance stable above space dimension four, marginally stable in dimension four, and unstable below dimension four.  See [[Quantum triviality]].}}\n\n==Momentum space==\nRenormalization groups, in practice, come in two main \"flavours\". The Kadanoff picture explained above refers mainly to the so-called '''real-space RG'''.\n\n'''Momentum-space RG''' on the other hand, has a longer history despite its relative subtlety.  It can be used for systems where the degrees of freedom can be cast in terms of the [[Fourier modes]] of a given field. The RG transformation proceeds by ''integrating out'' a certain set of high-momentum (large-wavenumber) modes. Since large wavenumbers are related to short-length scales, the momentum-space RG results in an essentially analogous coarse-graining effect as with real-space RG.\n\nMomentum-space RG is usually performed on a [[perturbation theory|perturbation]] expansion. The validity of such an expansion is predicated upon the actual physics of a system being close to that of a [[free field]] system. In this case, one may calculate observables by summing the leading terms in the expansion. \nThis approach has proved  successful for many theories, including most of particle physics, but fails for systems whose physics is very far from any free system, i.e., systems with strong correlations.\n\nAs an example of the physical meaning of RG in particle physics,  consider an overview of ''charge renormalization'' in [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED). Suppose we have a point positive charge of a certain true (or '''bare''') magnitude. The electromagnetic field around it has a certain energy, and thus may produce some pairs of (e.g.) electrons-positrons, which will be annihilated very quickly. But, in their short life, the electron will be attracted by the charge, and the positron will be repelled. Since this happens continuously, these pairs are effectively '''screening''' the charge from abroad. Thus, the measured strength of the charge will depend on how close to our probes it may enter. Hence a ''dependence of a certain coupling constant (here, the electric charge) with distance scale''.\n\nMomentum and length scales are related inversely, according to the  [[de Broglie relation]]: the higher the energy or momentum scale we may reach, the lower the length scale we may probe and resolve. Therefore, the momentum-space RG practitioners sometimes declaim to ''integrate out'' high momenta or high energy from their theories.\n\n==Exact renormalization group equations==\nAn '''exact renormalization group equation''' ('''ERGE''') is one that takes [[irrelevant]] couplings into account. There  are several formulations.\n\nThe '''Wilson ERGE''' is the simplest conceptually,  but is practically impossible to implement. [[Fourier transform]] into [[momentum space]] after [[Wick rotation|Wick rotating]] into [[Euclidean space]]. Insist upon a hard momentum [[Cutoff (physics)|cutoff]], {{math|''p''<sup>2</sup> \u2264 ''\u039b''<sup>2</sup>}} so that the only degrees of freedom are those with momenta less than {{mvar|\u039b}}. The [[partition function (quantum field theory)|partition function]] is\n:<math>Z=\\int_{p^2\\leq \\Lambda^2} \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\exp\\left[-S_\\Lambda[\\phi]\\right].</math>\n\nFor any positive  {{mvar|\u039b'}} less than  {{mvar|\u039b}}, define {{math|''S<sub>\u039b'</sub>''}} (a functional over field configurations  {{mvar|\u03c6}} whose Fourier transform has momentum support within {{math|''p''<sup>2</sup> \u2264 ''\u039b' ''<sup>2</sup>}}) as\n:<math>\\exp\\left(-S_{\\Lambda'}[\\phi]\\right)\\ \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\  \\int_{\\Lambda'  \\leq p \\leq \\Lambda} \\mathcal{D}\\phi   \\exp\\left[-S_\\Lambda[\\phi]\\right].</math>\n\nObviously,\n:<math>Z=\\int_{p^2\\leq {\\Lambda'}^2}\\mathcal{D}\\phi \\exp\\left[-S_{\\Lambda'}[\\phi]\\right].</math>\n\nIn fact, this transformation is [[transitive relation|transitive]]. If you compute  {{math|''S<sub>\u039b\u2032</sub>''}} from  {{math|''S<sub>\u039b</sub>''}} and then compute S<sub>\u039b&Prime;</sub> from S<sub>\u039b\u2032</sub>, this gives you the same Wilsonian action as computing S<sub>\u039b&Prime;</sub> directly from S<sub>\u039b</sub>.\n\nThe '''Polchinski ERGE''' involves a [[smooth function|smooth]] UV [[regularization (physics)|regulator]] [[Cutoff (physics)|cutoff]]. Basically, the idea is an improvement over the Wilson ERGE. Instead of a sharp momentum cutoff, it uses a smooth cutoff. Essentially, we suppress contributions from momenta greater than  {{mvar|\u039b}} heavily. The smoothness of the cutoff, however, allows us to derive a functional [[differential equation]] in the cutoff scale  {{mvar|\u039b}}. As in Wilson's approach, we have a different action functional for each cutoff energy scale  {{mvar|\u039b}}. Each of these actions are supposed to describe exactly the same model which means that their [[partition function (quantum field theory)|partition functional]]s have to match exactly.\n\nIn other words, (for a real scalar field; generalizations to other fields are obvious),\n:<math>Z_\\Lambda[J]=\\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\exp\\left(-S_\\Lambda[\\phi]+J\\cdot \\phi\\right)=\\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\exp\\left(-\\tfrac{1}{2}\\phi\\cdot R_\\Lambda \\cdot \\phi-S_{\\text{int}\\,\\Lambda}[\\phi]+J\\cdot\\phi\\right)</math>\n\nand Z<sub>\u039b</sub> is really independent of {{mvar|\u039b}}! We have used the condensed [[deWitt notation]] here. We have also split the bare action S<sub>\u039b</sub> into a quadratic kinetic part and an interacting part S<sub>int \u039b</sub>. This split most certainly isn't clean. The \"interacting\" part can very well also contain quadratic kinetic terms. In fact, if there is any [[wave function renormalization]], it most certainly will. This can be somewhat reduced by introducing field rescalings. R<sub>\u039b</sub> is a function of the momentum p and the second term in the exponent is\n:<math>\\frac{1}{2}\\int \\frac{d^dp}{(2\\pi)^d}\\tilde{\\phi}^*(p)R_\\Lambda(p)\\tilde{\\phi}(p)</math>\nwhen expanded.\n\nWhen <math>p \\ll \\Lambda</math>, {{math|''R''<sub>\u039b</sub>(''p'')/''p''<sup>2</sup>}} is essentially 1. When <math>p \\gg \\Lambda</math>, {{math|''R''<sub>\u039b</sub>(''p'')/''p''<sup>2</sup>}} becomes very very huge and approaches infinity. {{math|''R''<sub>\u039b</sub>(''p'')/''p''<sup>2</sup>}} is always greater than or equal to 1 and is smooth. Basically, this leaves the fluctuations with momenta less than the cutoff {{mvar|\u039b}} unaffected but heavily suppresses contributions from fluctuations with momenta greater than the cutoff. This is obviously a huge improvement over Wilson.\n\nThe condition that\n:<math>\\frac{d}{d\\Lambda}Z_\\Lambda=0</math>\ncan be satisfied by (but not only by)\n:<math>\\frac{d}{d\\Lambda}S_{\\text{int}\\,\\Lambda}=\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\delta S_{\\text{int}\\,\\Lambda}}{\\delta \\phi}\\cdot \\left(\\frac{d}{d\\Lambda}R_\\Lambda^{-1}\\right)\\cdot \\frac{\\delta S_{\\text{int}\\,\\Lambda}}{\\delta \\phi}-\\frac{1}{2}\\operatorname{Tr}\\left[\\frac{\\delta^2 S_{\\text{int}\\,\\Lambda}}{\\delta \\phi\\, \\delta \\phi}\\cdot R_\\Lambda^{-1}\\right].</math>\n\n[[Jacques Distler]] claimed without proof that this ERGE is not correct [[nonperturbative]]ly.<ref>{{cite web |author-link=Jacques Distler |first=Jacques |last=Distler |url=http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000648.html |title=000648.html  |website=golem.ph.utexas.edu}}</ref>\n\nThe '''effective average action ERGE''' involves a smooth IR regulator cutoff. \nThe idea is to take all fluctuations right up to an IR scale {{mvar|k}} into account.  The '''effective average action''' will be accurate for fluctuations with momenta larger than {{mvar|k}}. As the parameter {{mvar|k}} is lowered, the effective average action approaches the [[effective action]] which includes all quantum and classical fluctuations. In contrast, for large {{mvar|k}} the effective average action is close to the \"bare action\". So, the effective average action interpolates between the \"bare action\" and the [[effective action]].\n\nFor a real [[scalar field]], one adds an IR cutoff\n:<math>\\frac{1}{2}\\int \\frac{d^dp}{(2\\pi)^d} \\tilde{\\phi}^*(p)R_k(p)\\tilde{\\phi}(p)</math>\nto the [[action (physics)|action]]  {{mvar|S}}, where R<sub>k</sub> is a function of both  {{mvar|k}} and  {{mvar|p}} such that for \n<math>p \\gg k</math>, R<sub>k</sub>(p) is very tiny and approaches 0 and for <math>p \\ll k</math>, <math>R_k(p)\\gtrsim k^2</math>. R<sub>k</sub> is both smooth and nonnegative. Its large value for small momenta leads to a suppression of their contribution to the partition function which is effectively the same thing as neglecting large-scale fluctuations.\n\nOne can use the condensed [[deWitt notation]]\n:<math>\\frac{1}{2} \\phi\\cdot R_k \\cdot \\phi</math>\nfor this IR regulator.\n\nSo,\n:<math>\\exp\\left(W_k[J]\\right)=Z_k[J]=\\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\exp\\left(-S[\\phi]-\\frac{1}{2}\\phi \\cdot R_k \\cdot \\phi +J\\cdot\\phi\\right)</math>\nwhere  {{mvar|J}} is the [[source field]]. The [[Legendre transform]] of W<sub>k</sub> ordinarily gives the [[effective action]]. However, the action that we started off with is really S[\u03c6]+1/2 \u03c6\u22c5R<sub>k</sub>\u22c5\u03c6 and so, to get the effective average action, we subtract off 1/2 \u03c6\u22c5R<sub>k</sub>\u22c5\u03c6. In other words,\n:<math>\\phi[J;k]=\\frac{\\delta W_k}{\\delta J}[J]</math>\ncan be inverted to give J<sub>k</sub>[\u03c6] and we define the effective average action \u0393<sub>k</sub> as\n:<math>\\Gamma_k[\\phi]\\ \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\  \\left(-W\\left[J_k[\\phi]\\right]+J_k[\\phi]\\cdot\\phi\\right)-\\tfrac{1}{2}\\phi\\cdot R_k\\cdot \\phi.</math>\n\nHence,\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\frac{d}{dk}\\Gamma_k[\\phi] &=-\\frac{d}{dk}W_k[J_k[\\phi]]-\\frac{\\delta W_k}{\\delta J}\\cdot\\frac{d}{dk}J_k[\\phi]+\\frac{d}{dk}J_k[\\phi]\\cdot \\phi-\\tfrac{1}{2}\\phi\\cdot \\frac{d}{dk}R_k \\cdot \\phi \\\\\n&=-\\frac{d}{dk}W_k[J_k[\\phi]]-\\tfrac{1}{2}\\phi\\cdot \\frac{d}{dk}R_k \\cdot \\phi \\\\\n&=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\left\\langle\\phi \\cdot \\frac{d}{dk}R_k \\cdot \\phi\\right\\rangle_{J_k[\\phi];k}-\\tfrac{1}{2}\\phi\\cdot \\frac{d}{dk}R_k \\cdot \\phi \\\\\n&=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\operatorname{Tr}\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\delta J_k}{\\delta \\phi}\\right)^{-1}\\cdot\\frac{d}{dk}R_k\\right] \\\\\n&=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\operatorname{Tr}\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\delta^2 \\Gamma_k}{\\delta \\phi \\delta \\phi}+R_k\\right)^{-1}\\cdot\\frac{d}{dk}R_k\\right]\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nthus\n:<math>\\frac{d}{dk}\\Gamma_k[\\phi] =\\tfrac{1}{2}\\operatorname{Tr}\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\delta^2 \\Gamma_k}{\\delta \\phi \\delta \\phi}+R_k\\right)^{-1}\\cdot\\frac{d}{dk}R_k\\right]</math>\nis the ERGE which is also known as the [[Christof Wetterich|Wetterich]] equation.

In the effective average action ERGE, the bare action is left unchanged (and the UV cutoff scale\u2014if there is one\u2014is also left unchanged) but the IR contributions to the effective action are suppressed whereas in the Polchinski ERGE, the QFT is fixed once and for all but the \"bare action\" is varied at different energy scales to reproduce the prespecified model. Polchinski's version is certainly much closer to Wilson's idea in spirit. Note that one uses \"bare actions\" whereas the other uses effective (average) actions.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Quantum triviality]]\n* [[Scale invariance]]\n* [[Schr\u00f6der's equation]]\n* [[Regularization (physics)]]\n* [[Density matrix renormalization group]]\n* [[Functional renormalization group]]\n* [[Critical phenomena]]\n* [[Universality (dynamical systems)]]\n* [[C-theorem]]\n* [[History of quantum field theory]]\n* [[Top quark]]\n* [[Asymptotic safety]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Remarks==\n{{notelist|1}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n==References==\n===Historical references===\n* {{cite journal |author-link=Michael Fisher |first=Michael |last=Fisher |year=1974 |title=The renormalization group in the theory of critical behavior |journal=Rev.

The first season opens in 1557, with Mary living in a convent in France, but she is quickly returned to the castle where we learn she is awaiting her marriage to [[Francis II of France|Prince Francis]], to whom she has been engaged since they were six. Mary has to contend with changing politics and power plays, as well as her burgeoning feelings for Francis and the romantic attentions of Francis's bastard half-brother, Bash. Francis's mother, [[Catherine de' Medici]], secretly tries to prevent the marriage following [[Nostradamus]]'s confidential prediction that the marriage will lead to Francis's death. The series also follows the affairs of Mary's Scottish handmaidens Kenna, Aylee, Lola, and Greer, who are searching for husbands of their own at French Court.\n\nThe second season opens after the death of [[Henry II of France|King Henry II]], and follows the rise of Francis and Mary as King and Queen of France and Scotland. Together they have to balance their marriage with their roles as monarchs, and deal with the rising religious conflict between [[French Wars of Religion|Catholics and Protestants]], as well as the ambitions of the rival [[House of Bourbon]] for the throne of France.\n\nThe third season follows Francis's declining health and his death partway through the season, leaving Mary a widow and struggling to find new footing since she's no longer bound to France as its queen. Francis's brother [[Charles IX of France|Charles]] is crowned the new underaged king, with Catherine as regent. The third season also introduces the court of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth of England]], who plots against Mary, fends off marital prospects, and deals with her secret love affair with [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley]].\n\nThe fourth and final season has Mary returned to Scotland and trying to regain power in her homeland. She has to manage her allies, such as her bastard half-brother [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray|James]] and the outspoken [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell|Lord Bothwell]], as well as her enemies, such as the Protestant preacher [[John Knox]]. Tensions mount between Mary and Elizabeth, with Mary marrying [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley|Lord Darnley]], an English Catholic claimant to the English throne, in the hopes of taking England. In France, Catherine has to protect her son, [[Charles IX of France|King Charles IX]], from the ambitions of her daughter [[Elisabeth of Valois|Queen Leeza of Spain]] and her younger son, [[Henry III of France|Henry]].\n\n==Cast and characters==\n<!--Do not convert the prose list to a cast table, there is no support for this format \u2013 see Talk page -->\n\n===Main===\n* [[Adelaide Kane]] as [[Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots]]\n* [[Megan Follows]] as [[Catherine de' Medici]]\n* Celina Sinden as Greer of [[Kinross-shire|Kinross]]\n* [[Toby Regbo]] as [[Francis II of France]]<ref group=lower-alpha>Toby Regbo was credited as main cast through the fifth episode of season 3, and for the series finale.</ref>\n* [[Torrance Coombs]] as Sebastian \"Bash\" de Poitiers (seasons 1\u20133)\n* [[Anna Popplewell]] as Lady Lola (seasons 1\u20133)\n* [[Caitlin Stasey]] as Lady Kenna (seasons 1\u20132)\n* [[Alan van Sprang]] as [[Henry II of France]] (main season 1;

The first season opens in 1557, with Mary living in a convent in France, but she is quickly returned to the castle where we learn she is awaiting her marriage to [[Francis II of France|Prince Francis]], to whom she has been engaged since they were six. Mary has to contend with changing politics and power plays, as well as her burgeoning feelings for Francis and the romantic attentions of Francis's bastard half-brother, Bash. Francis's mother, [[Catherine de' Medici]], secretly tries to prevent the marriage following [[Nostradamus]]'s confidential prediction that the marriage will lead to Francis's death. The series also follows the affairs of Mary's Scottish handmaidens Kenna, Aylee, Lola, and Greer, who are searching for husbands of their own at French Court.\n\nThe second season opens after the death of [[Henry II of France|King Henry II]], and follows the rise of Francis and Mary as King and Queen of France and Scotland. Together they have to balance their marriage with their roles as monarchs, and deal with the rising religious conflict between [[French Wars of Religion|Catholics and Protestants]], as well as the ambitions of the rival [[House of Bourbon]] for the throne of France.\n\nThe third season follows Francis's declining health and his death partway through the season, leaving Mary a widow and struggling to find new footing since she's no longer bound to France as its queen. Francis's brother [[Charles IX of France|Charles]] is crowned the new underaged king, with Catherine as regent. The third season also introduces the court of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth of England]], who plots against Mary, fends off marital prospects, and deals with her secret love affair with [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley]].\n\nThe fourth and final season has Mary returned to Scotland and trying to regain power in her homeland. She has to manage her allies, such as her bastard half-brother [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray|James]] and the outspoken [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell|Lord Bothwell]], as well as her enemies, such as the Protestant preacher [[John Knox]]. Tensions mount between Mary and Elizabeth, with Mary marrying [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley|Lord Darnley]], an English Catholic claimant to the English throne, in the hopes of taking England. In France, Catherine has to protect her son, [[Charles IX of France|King Charles IX]], from the ambitions of her daughter [[Elisabeth of Valois|Queen Leeza of Spain]] and her younger son, [[Henry III of France|Henry]].\n\n==Cast and characters==\n<!--Do not convert the prose list to a cast table, there is no support for this format \u2013 see Talk page -->\n\n===Main===\n* [[Adelaide Kane]] as [[Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots]]\n* [[Megan Follows]] as [[Catherine de' Medici]]\n* Celina Sinden as Greer of [[Kinross-shire|Kinross]]\n* [[Toby Regbo]] as [[Francis II of France]]<ref group=lower-alpha>Toby Regbo was credited as main cast through the fifth episode of season 3, and for the series finale.</ref>\n* [[Torrance Coombs]] as Sebastian \"Bash\" de Poitiers (seasons 1\u20133)\n* [[Anna Popplewell]] as Lady Lola (seasons 1\u20133)\n* [[Caitlin Stasey]] as Lady Kenna (seasons 1\u20132)\n* [[Alan van Sprang]] as [[Henry II of France]] (main season 1;

{"title_page": "Tom Meade", "text_new": "'''Thomas \"Tom\" Meade''' (19{{Nbsp}}January 1939{{Spaced en dash}}August 2013) was an American automobile designer and dealer best known for his ''Thomassima'' series of [[custom cars]] based on [[Ferrari]] engines and chassis. He was based in [[Modena|Modena, Italy]] from the early 1960s through the early 1970s, where he met and collaborated with many Modenese ''[[Coachbuilder|carrozzeria]]'', manufacturers and mechanics.\n\n== Early life ==\nTom Meade was born in [[Hollywood]] on 19 January 1939, to a [[single mother]]. He spent his youth with her in [[Australia]] and [[Honolulu, Hawaii]]. When he reached the high school age, they moved in [[Newport Beach, California]]. He graduated at 17 and enrolled in the [[U.S. Navy]] where he was trained as an [[Avionics|avionic]] engineer, until his leave in 1960.<ref name=mom>{{cite web |url=http://www.thomassima.com/ |title=Meade of Modena. An American Dreamer In the Land of Artful Science|last=Crane |first=Larry |date= |website=thomassima.com |access-date=19 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nOne day, during his walk home from work in [[Costa Mesa]], he spotted through the open door of a garage the back of a 1957 [[Ferrari 500 TRC]], calling it the most beautiful car he had ever seen. The owner initially tried to sell the car to Meade for a disproportionate amount with no avail; then he revealed to have bought the car in [[Rome, Italy]], where there was a warehouse full of old [[Sports car racing|racecars]] for sale at a low price.<ref name=mom/><ref name=rt>{{cite magazine |last=Coltrin |first=Pete |orig-year=December 1970|date=7 November 2014|title=Tom Meade's wild Ferrari Thomassima was the P4/5 of its day |url=https://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a6441/ferrari-thomassima/ |magazine=[[Road & Track]] |location=New York |publisher=[[Hearst Magazines]]}}</ref><ref name=oct>{{cite magazine |last=Sonnery |first=Marc |date=March 2020 |title=Maximum Dose |url= |magazine=[[Octane (magazine)|Octane]] |location=Wollaston, Northamptonshire |publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]]|pp=86\u201397}}</ref>{{rp|89}}<br/>\nFascinated, Meade decided on impulse that he would put his hands on one of those cars at any cost. In the autumn of 1960, he left home with only $50 and hitchhiked to [[New Orleans]] where he signed on to a freighter heading for [[Stavanger]], Norway, as [[steward's assistant]]. Once he arrived, he crossed Europe and made his way to Italy.<ref name=mom/><ref name=rt/><ref name=oct/>{{rp|89}}\n\n== Life in Italy ==\nOnce in Rome, Meade found a job as an [[extra (acting)|extra]] in [[Dino De Laurentiis]]\u2019 1961 film ''[[The Best of Enemies (1961 film)|The Best of Enemies]]'': he played a background English officer at night, and fruitlessly searched for the fabled warehouse during the day. In the end, he realized that the warehouse was only a myth and thus left Rome for [[Modena]], where the headquarters of Ferrari and [[Maserati]] were located.<ref name=mom/>\n\nMeade had no contacts in Modena and no money for lodging, sleeping outdoors when he first arrived. Shortly after his arrival, he visited the Maserati factory during the evening, after operations closed for the day. By chance, [[Aurelio Bertocchi]], the son of Maserati race director [[Guerino Bertocchi]], was working late and gave Meade a factory tour, thinking Meade was a potential customer for a new [[Maserati 3500 GT]]. During the tour, Meade spotted a retired racing car in storage at the factory, a [[Maserati 350S]], chassis 3503. Meade made a deal with Bertocchi to purchase the car for $420. It was missing an engine and needed body repairs. Through Bertocchi, Meade made contact with the shops of [[Neri and Bonacini]] and [[Medardo Fantuzzi]], in order to find repair facilities. Meade met [[Lloyd Casner|Lloyd \"Lucky\" Casner]] of the [[Camoradi]] racing team while visiting the Maserati factory, and was subsequently able to purchase a [[Chevy small block|Chevy V8]] engine from him. This engine originated from a [[Zora Arkus-Duntov|Arkus-Duntov]] engineered racing [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvette]] that was wrecked by Camoradi team mechanic [[Bob Wallace (test_driver)|Bob Wallace]]. Meade and his collaborators rebuilt the 350S with the Chevy engine and customized the body with a removable hard top. Meade shipped the car to [[San Francisco]] in 1962, where it was subsequently crashed by an associate and sold for  $2700.<ref name=\"mom\" /><ref name=\"ait\" /><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://magazine.ferrari.com/blog/2014/08/italian-heart-american-blood/|title=ITALIAN HEART, AMERICAN BLOOD|last=Barlow|first=Jason|date=15 August 2014|website=The Official Ferrari Magazine|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140831103306/https://magazine.ferrari.com/blog/2014/08/italian-heart-american-blood/|archive-date=31 August 2014|access-date=19 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"rt\" />\n\nThis first project allowed Meade to establish a network of contacts in Modena that would allow his future projects of rebuilding, customizing and dealing cars. In addition to Bertocchi, Neri, Bonacini and Fantuzzi, Meade's contacts included [[Piero Drogo]], [[David Piper (racing driver)|David Piper]], [[Alejandro de Tomaso]], [[Giovanni Volpi|Count Giovanni Volpi]], ''[[Road & Track]]'' journalist Peter Coltrin and [[Carroll Shelby]]. Meade took up residence in the Carrozzeria Fantuzzi workshop and took instruction in hand-forming and repairing bodywork from Medardo Fantuzzi. He briefly left Italy in 1962, returning in 1963 whereupon he began renting an apartment and garage adjacent to the [[Autodromo di Modena]]. Soon after, Meade began buying and selling a higher volume of cars, including many which were exported to the United States. These included another Maserati 350S, a [[Maserati Tipo 61|Maserati Tipo 63]], [[Ferrari 250 GTO]]<nowiki/>s, a [[Ferrari 330 P3|330 P3]], a [[Ferrari 250 LM|250 LM]], a [[Ferrari 250 GT SWB|250 GT SWB]], [[Ferrari 250 GT Lusso|250 GT Lusso]]<nowiki/>s and others. Meade's customers included Richard Merritt (founder of the [[Ferrari Club of America]]) and Los Angeles-based Ferrari importer Edwin K. Niles. During this period from 1963 to approximately 1970, Meade constructed his ''Thomassima'' series and several other projects based on various chassis and engines.

He spent his youth with her in [[Australia]] and [[Honolulu, Hawaii]]. When he reached the high school age, they moved in [[Newport Beach, California]].

In the autumn of 1960, he left home with only $50 and hitchhiked to [[New Orleans]] where he signed on to a freighter heading for [[Stavanger]], Norway, as [[steward's assistant]]. Once he arrived, he crossed Europe and made his way to Italy.<ref name=mom/><ref name=rt/><ref name=oct/>{{rp|89}}\n\n== Life in Italy ==\nOnce in Rome, Meade found a job as an [[extra (acting)|extra]] in [[Dino De Laurentiis]]\u2019 1961 film ''[[The Best of Enemies (1961 film)|The Best of Enemies]]'': he played a background English officer at night, and fruitlessly searched for the fabled warehouse during the day. In the end, he realized that the warehouse was only a myth and thus left Rome for [[Modena]], where the headquarters of Ferrari and [[Maserati]] were located.<ref name=mom/>\n\nMeade had no contacts in Modena and no money for lodging, sleeping outdoors when he first arrived. Shortly after his arrival, he visited the Maserati factory during the evening, after operations closed for the day. By chance, [[Aurelio Bertocchi]], the son of Maserati race director [[Guerino Bertocchi]], was working late and gave Meade a factory tour, thinking Meade was a potential customer for a new [[Maserati 3500 GT]]. During the tour, Meade spotted a retired racing car in storage at the factory, a [[Maserati 350S]], chassis 3503. Meade made a deal with Bertocchi to purchase the car for $420. It was missing an engine and needed body repairs. Through Bertocchi, Meade made contact with the shops of [[Neri and Bonacini]] and [[Medardo Fantuzzi]], in order to find repair facilities. Meade met [[Lloyd Casner|Lloyd \"Lucky\" Casner]] of the [[Camoradi]] racing team while visiting the Maserati factory, and was subsequently able to purchase a [[Chevy small block|Chevy V8]] engine from him. This engine originated from a [[Zora Arkus-Duntov|Arkus-Duntov]] engineered racing [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvette]] that was wrecked by Camoradi team mechanic [[Bob Wallace (test_driver)|Bob Wallace]]. Meade and his collaborators rebuilt the 350S with the Chevy engine and customized the body with a removable hard top. Meade shipped the car to [[San Francisco]] in 1962, where it was subsequently crashed by an associate and sold for  $2700.<ref name=\"mom\" /><ref name=\"ait\" /><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://magazine.ferrari.com/blog/2014/08/italian-heart-american-blood/|title=ITALIAN HEART, AMERICAN BLOOD|last=Barlow|first=Jason|date=15 August 2014|website=The Official Ferrari Magazine|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140831103306/https://magazine.ferrari.com/blog/2014/08/italian-heart-american-blood/|archive-date=31 August 2014|access-date=19 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"rt\" />\n\nThis first project allowed Meade to establish a network of contacts in Modena that would allow his future projects of rebuilding, customizing and dealing cars.

Meade took up residence in the Carrozzeria Fantuzzi workshop and took instruction in hand-forming and repairing bodywork from Medardo Fantuzzi. He briefly left Italy in 1962, returning in 1963 whereupon he began renting an apartment and garage adjacent to the [[Autodromo di Modena]]. Soon after, Meade began buying and selling a higher volume of cars, including many which were exported to the United States. These included another Maserati 350S, a [[Maserati Tipo 61|Maserati Tipo 63]], [[Ferrari 250 GTO]]<nowiki/>s, a [[Ferrari 330 P3|330 P3]], a [[Ferrari 250 LM|250 LM]], a [[Ferrari 250 GT SWB|250 GT SWB]], [[Ferrari 250 GT Lusso|250 GT Lusso]]<nowiki/>s and others.

It is probably Berg's best-known and most frequently performed instrumental piece, in which the composer sought to reconcile [[diatonicism]] and [[dodecaphony]]. Berg composed it on a commission from [[Louis Krasner]], and it became the last work that he completed. Krasner performed the solo part in the premiere at the [[Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana]], [[Barcelona]] on 19 April 1936, after the composer's death.\n\n== Conception and composition ==\nThe piece stemmed from a commission from the [[violin]]ist [[Louis Krasner]]. When he first received the commission, Berg was working on his opera ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'', and he did not begin work on the [[concerto]] for some months. The event that spurred him into writing was the death by polio of 18-year-old [[Manon Gropius]], the daughter of [[Alma Mahler]] (once [[Gustav Mahler]]'s wife) and [[Walter Gropius]]. Berg set ''Lulu'' aside to write the concerto, which he dedicated \"To the memory of an angel\".<ref name=\"Glass\" />\n\nBerg worked on the piece very quickly, completing it within a few months; it is thought that his working on the concerto was largely responsible for his failing to complete ''Lulu'' before his death on 24 December 1935. The violin concerto was the last work that Berg completed. In a letter to Krasner dated 16 July 1935, Berg confessed: {{quote|Yesterday I finished the composition [without the orchestration] of our Violin Concerto.

The second movement starts with an [[tempo|Allegro]] largely based on a single recurring [[rhythm]]ic [[cell (music)|cell]]; this section has been described as [[cadenza]]-like, with very difficult passages in the solo part. The orchestration becomes rather violent at its climax (which is literally marked in the score as \"High point of the Allegro\"); the fourth and final section, marked [[tempo|Adagio]], is in a much calmer mood.

New York: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-68200-8}} (pbk).</ref> {{audio|Berg - Violin Concerto lament melody.mid|Play}}]]\n\nLike a number of other works by Berg, the piece combines the [[twelve tone technique]], typical of [[Serialism|serialistic music]] learned from his teacher [[Arnold Schoenberg]] with passages written in a freer, more tonal style. The score integrates serialism and tonality in a remarkable fashion. Here is Berg's tone row:\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> \\new Staff \\with { \\remove \"Time_signature_engraver\" \\remove \"Bar_engraver\" } \\relative c' { \\clef treble \\override Stem #'transparent = ##t g4 bes d fis a c e gis b cis ees f } </score>\nAlthough this contains all twelve notes of the [[chromatic scale]], there is a strong tonal undercurrent: the first three notes of the row make up a [[G minor]] [[Triad (music)|triad]]; notes three to five are a [[D major]] triad; notes five to seven are an [[A minor]] triad; notes seven to nine are an [[E major]] triad;\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> { \\new PianoStaff << \\new Staff \\relative c' { \\clef treble \\time 2/4 r8 <d bes>4( <d bes>8~ | <d bes> <d a>4 <d a>8~ | <d a>) <c a>4( <c a>8~ | <c a> <b e,>4 <b e,>8) } \\new Staff \\relative c { \\clef bass \\time 2/4 g,2( | fis' | e' | gis, } >> } </score>\nand the last four notes (B, C{{music|#}}, E{{music|b}}, F) and the first (G) together make up part of a [[whole tone scale]].  The roots of the four triads correspond to the [[Open string (music)|open strings]] of the violin, which is highlighted in the opening passage of the piece.\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> \\relative c' { \\clef treble \\numericTimeSignature \\time 4/4 g8(\\pp d' a' e') e( a, d, g,~ | g1) } </score>\nThe resulting triads are thus fifth-related and form a [[cadence (music)|cadence]], which we hear directly before the row is played by the violin for the first time.  Moreover, the four chords above imply the note sequence  B (B{{music|flat}}) \u2013 A \u2013 C \u2013 H (B{{music|natural}}) which forms the [[BACH motif]], thus connecting the piece to [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], whose music plays a crucial role in this concerto. \n\nThe last four notes of the row, ascending whole tones, are also the first four notes of the [[chorale]] melody of \"[[Es ist genug]]\" (It is enough), another part of the whole tone scale. Bach composed a [[SATB|four-part]] setting of the hymn by [[Franz Joachim Burmeister]] with a melody by [[Johann Rudolf Ahle]] to conclude his cantata [[O Ewigkeit, du Donnerwort, BWV 60|''O Ewigkeit, du Donnerwort'', BWV 60]] (O eternity, you word of thunder).<ref>[http://www.bach-chorales.com/BWV0060_5.htm BWV 60.5] bach-chorales.com</ref> The first four measures are shown below.\n\n: <score lang=\"lilypond\" vorbis=\"1\">\n   \\new PianoStaff <<\n      \\new Staff <<\n         \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n             \\stemUp \\clef treble \\key f \\major \\time 4/4\n             \\[ f2 g4 a \n             b2 \\] r4 b\n             c4 g g bes! \n             a2.\n             }\n         \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n             \\stemDown\n              c2 c4 bes8 a \n              e'2 s4 e\n              e4. f8 e d e c \n              f2.\n              }\n            >>\n     \\new Staff <<\n         \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n             \\stemUp \\clef bass \\key f \\major \\time 4/4\n             a2 g4 d' \n             d2 r4 gis,\n             a8 b c4 c c \n             c2.\n             }\n         \\new Voice \\relative c {\n             \\stemDown\n             f2 e4 fis \n             gis2 s4 e\n             a8 g!16 f e8 d c bes! a g!\n             f2.\n             }\n         >>\n    >>\n</score>\n\nBerg quotes this chorale directly in the last movement of the piece, where Bach's harmonization is heard in the [[clarinet]]s. \n\nThere is another directly quoted tonal passage in the work in the form of a [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthian]] [[folk song]] in the second section of the first movement, which returns briefly before the [[Coda (music)|coda]] in the second movement.

The score integrates serialism and tonality in a remarkable fashion. Here is Berg's tone row:\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> \\new Staff \\with { \\remove \"Time_signature_engraver\" \\remove \"Bar_engraver\" } \\relative c' { \\clef treble \\override Stem #'transparent = ##t g4 bes d fis a c e gis b cis ees f } </score>\nAlthough this contains all twelve notes of the [[chromatic scale]], there is a strong tonal undercurrent: the first three notes of the row make up a [[G minor]] [[Triad (music)|triad]]; notes three to five are a [[D major]] triad; notes five to seven are an [[A minor]] triad; notes seven to nine are an [[E major]] triad;\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> { \\new PianoStaff << \\new Staff \\relative c' { \\clef treble \\time 2/4 r8 <d bes>4( <d bes>8~ | <d bes> <d a>4 <d a>8~ | <d a>) <c a>4( <c a>8~ | <c a> <b e,>4 <b e,>8) } \\new Staff \\relative c { \\clef bass \\time 2/4 g,2( | fis' | e' | gis, } >> } </score>\nand the last four notes (B, C{{music|#}}, E{{music|b}}, F) and the first (G) together make up part of a [[whole tone scale]].  The roots of the four triads correspond to the [[Open string (music)|open strings]] of the violin, which is highlighted in the opening passage of the piece.\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> \\relative c' { \\clef treble \\numericTimeSignature \\time 4/4 g8(\\pp d' a' e') e( a, d, g,~ | g1) } </score>\nThe resulting triads are thus fifth-related and form a [[cadence (music)|cadence]], which we hear directly before the row is played by the violin for the first time.  Moreover, the four chords above imply the note sequence  B (B{{music|flat}}) \u2013 A \u2013 C \u2013 H (B{{music|natural}}) which forms the [[BACH motif]], thus connecting the piece to [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], whose music plays a crucial role in this concerto. \n\nThe last four notes of the row, ascending whole tones, are also the first four notes of the [[chorale]] melody of \"[[Es ist genug]]\" (It is enough), another part of the whole tone scale. Bach composed a [[SATB|four-part]] setting of the hymn by [[Franz Joachim Burmeister]] with a melody by [[Johann Rudolf Ahle]] to conclude his cantata [[O Ewigkeit, du Donnerwort, BWV 60|''O Ewigkeit, du Donnerwort'', BWV 60]] (O eternity, you word of thunder).<ref>[http://www.bach-chorales.com/BWV0060_5.htm BWV 60.5] bach-chorales.com</ref> The first four measures are shown below.\n\n: <score lang=\"lilypond\" vorbis=\"1\">\n   \\new PianoStaff <<\n      \\new Staff <<\n         \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n             \\stemUp \\clef treble \\key f \\major \\time 4/4\n             \\[ f2 g4 a \n             b2 \\] r4 b\n             c4 g g bes! \n             a2.\n             }\n         \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n             \\stemDown\n              c2 c4 bes8 a \n              e'2 s4 e\n              e4. f8 e d e c \n              f2.\n              }\n            >>\n     \\new Staff <<\n         \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n             \\stemUp \\clef bass \\key f \\major \\time 4/4\n             a2 g4 d' \n             d2 r4 gis,\n             a8 b c4 c c \n             c2.\n             }\n         \\new Voice \\relative c {\n             \\stemDown\n             f2 e4 fis \n             gis2 s4 e\n             a8 g!16 f e8 d c bes! a g!\n             f2.\n             }\n         >>\n    >>\n</score>\n\nBerg quotes this chorale directly in the last movement of the piece, where Bach's harmonization is heard in the [[clarinet]]s. \n\nThere is another directly quoted tonal passage in the work in the form of a [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthian]] [[folk song]] in the second section of the first movement, which returns briefly before the [[Coda (music)|coda]] in the second movement. This is perhaps the only section which does not derive its materials from the row.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> \\relative c' { \\clef treble \\key g \\major \\time 3/4 \\partial 4*1 << { d4 | b'8. b16 d4 g8 b | b,4 d g | fis4. e8 e4 | c2. | c'4. fis,8 d4 | c' fis, d8 c' | b2 g8 b | d,2 } \\\\ { d,4 | g8. g16 b4 d | g, b e | d4. c8 c4 | fis,2. | fis'4. d8 c4 | fis d c8 fis | g2 d8 d | b2 } >> } </score>\n\nAnthony Pople describes the work as \"less serial than ''Lulu''\", containing originally serial material later repeated or developed outside that framework, in addition to small adjustments throughout to avoid bare octaves.<ref>Pople, Anthony (1991).

[[Louis Krasner]] played the solo part, and Pau Casals orchestra was conducted by [[Hermann Scherchen]].<ref name=\"Glass\" />\n** [[Anton Webern]] was intended to be the conductor.  Reports vary as to whether he was ill or was emotionally unable to cope with the subject matter of the music.  In any case, Scherchen happened to be there for the Festival, and he was drafted at literally the 11th hour.  The first time he ever saw the score was at 11 pm the night before the premiere, and the next morning there was time for only half an hour rehearsal.<ref name=kras>[http://www.schoenberg.at/library/index.php/attachments/single/1535 Louis Krasner, ''Some Memories of Anton Webern, the Berg Concerto and Vienna in the 1930s'']</ref>\n* British private premiere: 1 May 1936, [[London]], at an invitation-only concert. Krasner was again the soloist (at the invitation of the BBC producer [[Edward Clark (conductor)|Edward Clark]], who had attended the world premiere in Barcelona), and Anton Webern conducted the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]]. This performance was recorded on acetate discs, which survived in Krasner's collection.
