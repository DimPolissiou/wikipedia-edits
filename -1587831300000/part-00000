Peel's [[Metropolitan Police Act 1829]] established a full-time, professional and centrally-organised police force for the greater London area known as the [[Metropolitan Police]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Metropolitan Police|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/laworder/policeprisons/overview/metropolitanpolice/|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=29 December 2013}}</ref> Legislation in the 1830s introduced policing in boroughs and many counties and, in the 1850s, policing was established nationally.\n\nThe [[Peelian Principles]] describe the philosophy that Sir Robert Peel developed to define an ethical police force. The principles traditionally ascribed to Peel state that:\n* Every police officer should be issued an [[Warrant card|identification number]], to assure accountability for his actions.\n* Whether the police are effective is not measured on the number of arrests, but on the lack of crime.\n* Above all else, an effective authority figure knows trust and accountability are paramount.  Hence, Peel's most often quoted principle that \"The police are the public and the public are the police.\"\n\n[[Peelian Principles#The Nine Principles of Policing|Nine principles of policing]] were set out in the \u2018General Instructions\u2019 issued to every new police officer in the Metropolitan Police from 1829.

In 1989, the [[West Midlands Serious Crime Squad]] was disbanded as a series of around 100 criminal cases failed or were subsequently overturned in the West Midlands, after new forensic techniques showed police officers had been tampering with statement evidence to secure convictions, including those of the [[Birmingham Six]].\n\nThe Police Complaints Board was replaced by the [[Police Complaints Authority (United Kingdom)|Police Complaints Authority]] in 1985, which itself was superseded by the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] in 2004.

In England and Wales, the vast majority of [[Police Oath#United Kingdom|attested]] [[constables]] enjoy full powers of arrest and search as granted by the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]]. For the purposes of this legislation, \"constables\" is defined to mean all police officers, irrespective of [[Police ranks of the United Kingdom|rank]]. Although police officers have wide-ranging powers, they are still subject to the same laws as members of the public (aside from specific exemptions such as the carrying of firearms and certain road traffic legislation).  There are additional legal restrictions placed on police officers such as the prohibitions on industrial action and on taking part in active politics.\n\n===Types of law enforcement agency===\n{{Main|List of law enforcement agencies in the United Kingdom}}\nThere are three general types of law enforcement agency in the United Kingdom. The first is mostly concerned with policing the general public and their activities and the others are concerned with policing of more specific matters:\n\n* '''Territorial police services''', which carry out the majority of policing. There are 45 [[Territorial police force#United Kingdom|territorial police services]] {{As of|2013|lc=on}} that cover a [[police area]] (a particular region) and have an independent [[police authority]] (England and Wales) or local authority or joint [[police board]] (Scotland). The [[Police Act 1996]], the [[Police (Scotland) Act 1967]] and the [[Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000]], prescribe a number of issues such as appointment of a [[chief constable]], and jurisdiction and responsibilities for police forces in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland respectively. Since the introduction of [[Police and Crime Commissioner]]s in November 2012, the police services in England and Wales no longer have a police authority and this work is done by the police and crime prevention commissioners who are elected every four years. Certain territorial police services have units within them which have a national role, such the Specialist Operations directorate of the Metropolitan Police.\n* '''National law enforcement agencies''', including the [[National Crime Agency]] and [[British Transport Police]] (the latter only operates in Great Britain). The [[Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]] refers to these as \"[[Special police force#United Kingdom|special police forces]]\". The National Crime Agency operates across the United Kingdom (but in Scotland or Northern Ireland requires the agreement of the domestic prosecuting authority to do so) against organised crime and acts as the UK point of contact for foreign agencies. There are also non-police law enforcement agencies whose officers, while not police constables, enforce laws such as the [[Serious Fraud Office (United Kingdom)|Serious Fraud Office]] and [[HM Revenue and Customs]].\n* '''Miscellaneous police services''', mostly having their foundations in older legislation or [[common law]]. These have a responsibility to police specific local areas or activities, such as ports and parks, and before the passing of recent legislation such as the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 were often referred to as \"special police services\"; care must therefore be taken in interpreting historical use of that phrase. These constabularies are not within the scope of the legislation applicable to the previously mentioned organisations but can still be the subject of statutes applicable to, for example, docks, harbours or railways. Until the passing of [[Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003]], the British Transport Police was such a force.\n\nThe [[list of law enforcement agencies in the United Kingdom]] details the various services.\n\n===Cross-jurisdiction powers===\nTerritorial police constables have certain powers of arrest in another one of the [[Legal jurisdictions of the United Kingdom|UK's three legal jurisdictions]] than they were attested in. There are four main provisions for them to do so&nbsp;\u2013 arrest with a warrant, arrest without a warrant for an offence committed in their home jurisdiction whilst in another jurisdiction, arrest without a warrant for an offence committed in another jurisdiction whilst in that jurisdiction, and mutual aid.  A fifth power of cross jurisdictional arrest was introduced by section 116 of the [[Policing and Crime Act 2017]] which fills a loop hole in arrest powers in certain situations.  This power came into force in March 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/227/regulation/2/made/data.htm|title=The Policing and Crime Act 2017 (Commencement No. 7) Regulations 2018|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=2019-01-03}}</ref>  This new power allows a constable from one jurisdiction to arrest without warrant a person suspected of an offence in another jurisdiction whilst in their home jurisdiction.  This power is in relation to more serious offences as listed in the act.  The Act sets out how long the person can be detained in custody by the 'arresting force' in one jurisdiction until constables from the 'investigating force' in another jurisdiction can travel to re-arrest the person and deal accordingly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2017/3/section/116?timeline=true|title=Policing and Crime Act 2017|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|others=Expert Participation|access-date=2017-12-22}}</ref>  Below is a summary of these five powers with a practical example due to the complicated nature of this area of law.  Note: this section applies to territorial police constables only, and not to others&nbsp;\u2013 except the British Transport Police, who also have [[British Transport Police#Cross-border powers|certain cross-border powers]] in addition to their natural powers.\n\n====Arrest with warrant====\nCertain warrants can be executed by constables even though they are outside their jurisdiction: [[arrest warrant]]s and [[Warrant of committal|warrants of committal]] (all); and a warrant to arrest a witness (England, Wales or Northern Ireland); a warrant for committal, a warrant to imprison (or to apprehend and imprison), and a warrant to arrest a witness (Scotland).<ref name=\"S136\">{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?parentActiveTextDocId=2156203&activetextdocid=2156396 |title=section 136, Criminal Justice & Public Order Act 1994 |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-01-16}}</ref> A warrant issued in one legal jurisdiction may be executed in either of the other two jurisdictions by a constable from either the jurisdiction where it was issued, or the jurisdiction where it is executed.<ref name=\"S136\"/>\n\nWhen executing a warrant issued in Scotland, the constable executing it shall have the same powers and duties, and the person arrested the same rights, as they would have had if execution had been in Scotland by a constable of a police force in Scotland.

relatively new power was introduced by the Policing and Crime Act 2017 and came into force in March 2018.<ref>{{Cite

suspected of an offence in another jurisdiction without a warrant.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/537277/Factsheet_14b_-_Cross-border_powers.pdf|title=Factsheet 14b - Policing and Crime Bill|last=|first=|date=|website=www.gov.uk|access-date=}}</ref>  Practically this meant that either a warrant had to be applied for, or constables from the investigating force have to travel to the jurisdiction where the person suspected was believed to be, to arrest under the cross border powers set out above.  In urgent and serious cases this caused several issues around delay and suspects evading capture.  This new power allows a constable of one jurisdiction to arrest without warrant a person suspected of an offence in another jurisdiction whilst in their home jurisdiction.  The Act sets out which offences this power of arrest will apply to in each jurisdiction (generally serious offences), and how long the person arrested can be kept in custody, with relevant authorities, by the 'arresting force' to allow sufficient time for officers from the 'investigating force' in another jurisdiction to travel and re-arrest the detained person for the purposes of their investigation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2017/3/section/116?timeline=true|title=Policing and Crime Act 2017|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|others=Expert Participation|access-date=2017-12-22}}</ref>\n\nAs a practical example of this power, a murder is committed in Aberdeen, Scotland.  The suspect immediately travels south over the border into England and is found by constables of [[Cumbria Police]] in Carlisle.  These constables would have a power of arrest in relation to the homicide that occurred in Scotland without the need to have a warrant.\n\n====Other situations (including Mutual Aid)====\nPolice forces often support each other with large-scale operations, such as those that require specialist skills or expertise and those that require policing levels that the host-forces cannot provide.

A person must make a declaration before taking up office as a constable and having any powers; although this is sometimes still known as the [[police oath]], and the process sometimes referred to as \"swearing in\", it now takes the form of an \"attestation\" (in [[England and Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]]) or a \"declaration\" (in [[Scotland]]). The process is carried out in the presence of a magistrate, and is usually followed by the issue of a warrant card. This grants the officer all the powers and privileges, duties and responsibilities of a constable in one of the three distinct legal systems - either England and Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland, and the territorial waters of that country. The limited circumstances where their powers extend across the border are described in the section above.\n\n===Other constables===\nThere are many constables who are not members of territorial police forces. The most notable are members of the three forces referred to as [[special police forces]]: the [[British Transport Police]], [[Ministry of Defence Police]] and [[Civil Nuclear Constabulary]].

As a result, they have the full powers of a constable on land owned by the harbour, dock, or port and at any place within one mile of any owned land. There are also forces created by specific legislation, such as the [[Port of Tilbury Police]] ([[Port of London Act 1968]]), [[Mersey Tunnels Police]] (County of Merseyside Act 1989) and the [[Epping Forest Keepers]] (Epping Forest Act 1878).\n\n====Parks Constables====\nUnder Article 18 of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government Provisional Order Confirmation (Greater London Parks and Open Spaces) Act 1967, [[London Borough Council]]s are allowed to swear in council officers as constables for \"securing the observance of the provisions of all enactments relating to open spaces under their control or management and of bye-laws and regulations made thereunder\". Local Authority Parks Constables have all the powers of a constable in relation byelaws regulations and all enactments relating to open spaces, Article 19 of the Act was repealed by section 26(1) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (Local Acts) and the power of arrest for Parks Constables is now contained in Section 24 of P.A.C.E 1984, further amendments to Article 19 covering coming to the aid and assistance of such a constable or officer were repealed by SOCPA 2005, as this provision is already covered in P.A.C.E 1984 (Legal Counsel 2007,2012).\nNo enforcement agency with a power of arrest or detention can operate outside of the provisions of P.A.C.E 1984; therefore all local powers of arrest and detention were brought into line under section 26(1) P.A.C.E 1984.\n\n===Police staff===\nPolice forces employ staff who perform many functions to assist officers and support the smooth running of their police force. They do not hold the office of constable.\nIn England & Wales, the [[chief police officer]] of a territorial police force may designate any person who is employed by the police authority maintaining that force, and is under the direction and control of that chief police officer, as one or more of the following:\n*[[Police Community Support Officer]]\n*Investigating Officer,\n*[[Custody assistant|detention officer]], or\n*Escort Officer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&PageNumber=0&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=112639&ActiveTextDocId=112693&filesize=53565 |title=Police Reform Act 2002 (c. 30) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref>\nThey have a range of powers given by the [[Police Reform Act 2002]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&PageNumber=0&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=112639&ActiveTextDocId=112842&filesize=2720 |title=Police Reform Act 2002 (c. 30) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> and their chief police officer decides which of these powers they may use. Unlike a police constable, a PCSO only has powers when on duty and in uniform, and within the area policed by their respective force.\n\nUntil 1991, parking enforcement was primarily conducted by police-employed [[traffic warden]]s. Since the passage of the Road Traffic Act 1991, [[decriminalised parking enforcement]] has enabled local authorities to take on this role and now very few forces still employ Police Traffic Wardens, these include the Metropolitan Police Service however they have combined the role with PCSOs as ''Traffic Police Community Support Officers''.\n\nIn Scotland, [[Police Custody and Security Officer]]s have powers similar to those of detention officers and escort officers in England and Wales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oqps.gov.uk/legislation/acts/acts2003/asp_20030007_en_13#pt12-pb1-l1g76 |title=Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2003 (asp 7) |publisher=Oqps.gov.uk |date=2008-12-31 |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> Similar powers are available in Northern Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=Act+(UK+Public+General)&title=Northern+Ireland&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&TYPE=QS&PageNumber=1&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=814668&ActiveTextDocId=814749&filesize=1903 |title=Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2003 (c. 6) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref>\n\n===Accredited Persons===\n[[Chief police officer]]s of territorial police forces<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&PageNumber=0&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=112639&ActiveTextDocId=112697&filesize=4936 |title=Police Reform Act 2002 (c. 30) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> (and the British Transport Police<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&PageNumber=0&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=112639&ActiveTextDocId=112699&filesize=6329 |title=Police Reform Act 2002 (c. 30) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref>) can also give limited powers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&PageNumber=0&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=112639&ActiveTextDocId=112884&filesize=641 |title=Police Reform Act 2002 (c. 30) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> to people not employed by the police authority, under [[Community Safety Accreditation Scheme]]s.

Because they are based on the British model of policing, these police forces conform to the standards set out by the British government, which includes voluntarily submitting themselves to inspection by the HMIC.

These officers are generally the most visible and will invariably be the first interface a member of the public has with police. In general terms these officers will normally patrol by vehicle (though also on foot or bicycle in urban areas). They will generally patrol a sub-division or whole division of a police force area or in the case of the Metropolitan Police Service, a borough. Nearly all police officers begin their careers in this area of policing, with some moving on to more specialist roles. The Metropolitan Police Service calls this area of policing 'Response Teams', whilst other forces use terms such as 'patrol', 'section' and other variations.\n* Most local areas or wards in the country have at least one police officer who is involved in trying to build links with the local community and resolve long-term problems. In London, the Metropolitan Police Service addresses this area of policing with Safer Neighbourhood Teams. This entails each political ward in London having a Police Sergeant, two police constables and a few PCSOs who are ring fenced to address problems and build community links in their respective wards. Other police forces have similar systems but can be named 'Area officers', 'Neighbourhood officers', 'Beat Constables' and a number of other variations.\n* Criminal Investigation Departments (CID) can be found in all police forces. Generally these officers deal with investigations of a more complex, serious nature, however this again can differ from force to force.  Most officers within this area are detectives. Depending on the force in question this area of policing can be further divided into a myriad of other specialist areas such as fraud.  Smaller forces tend to have detectives who deal with a wide range of varied investigations whereas detectives in larger forces can have a very specialist remit.\n* All police forces have specialist departments that deal with certain aspects of policing. Larger forces such as Greater Manchester Police, Strathclyde Police and West Midlands Police have many and varied departments and units such as traffic, firearms, marine, horse, tactical support all named differently depending on the force.  Smaller forces such Dyfed Powys Police and Warwickshire Police will have fewer specialists and will rely on cross training, such as firearms officers also being traffic trained officers. The Metropolitan Police, the largest force in the country, has a large number of specialist departments, some of which are unique to the Metropolitan Police due to policing the capital and its national responsibilities. For example, the [[Diplomatic Protection Group]] and [[Counter Terrorism Command]].\n\n====Fixated Threat Assessment Centre====\n{{main|Fixated Threat Assessment Centre}}\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Fixated Threat Assessment Centre]] is a joint police/mental health unit set up in October 2006 by the [[Home Office]], the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] and [[Metropolitan Police Service]] to identify and address those individuals considered to pose a threat to VIPs or the Royal Family.\n<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article1847697.ece|publisher=The Times|title=VIP 'stalker' squad set up by government|author=Joanna Bale|date=May 27, 2007 | location=London}}</ref> They may then be referred to local health services for further assessment and potential [[involuntary commitment]].

On 1 April 2007 the [[Border and Immigration Agency]] (BIA) was created and commenced operation. However, there were no police officers in the Agency, a matter that attracted considerable criticism when the Agency was established - agency officers have limited powers of arrest.  Further powers for designated officers within the Agency, including powers of detention pending the arrival of a police officer, were introduced by the UK Borders Act 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&title=uk+borders&parentActiveTextDocId=3419168&ActiveTextDocId=3419168&filesize=198579 |title=UK Borders Act 2007 (c. 30) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date=2007-10-30 |accessdate=2009-05-28}}</ref>\n\nThe Government has effectively admitted the shortcomings of the Agency by making a number of fundamental changes within a year of its commencement.

Peel's [[Metropolitan Police Act 1829]] established a full-time, professional and centrally-organised police force for the greater London area known as the [[Metropolitan Police]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Metropolitan Police|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/laworder/policeprisons/overview/metropolitanpolice/|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=29 December 2013}}</ref> Legislation in the 1830s introduced policing in boroughs and many counties and, in the 1850s, policing was established nationally.\n\nThe [[Peelian Principles]] describe the philosophy that Sir Robert Peel developed to define an ethical police force. The principles traditionally ascribed to Peel state that:\n* Every police officer should be issued an [[Warrant card|identification number]], to assure accountability for his actions.\n* Whether the police are effective is not measured on the number of arrests, but on the lack of crime.\n* Above all else, an effective authority figure knows trust and accountability are paramount.  Hence, Peel's most often quoted principle that \"The police are the public and the public are the police.\"\n\n[[Peelian Principles#The Nine Principles of Policing|Nine principles of policing]] were set out in the \u2018General Instructions\u2019 issued to every new police officer in the Metropolitan Police from 1829.

A [[Police Complaints Board]] was set up to handle allegations of malpractice in response.\n\nChanges took place to tighten police procedures in the 1980s, in response to the [[Scarman Report]], to ensure that evidence and interviews were robust, in the introduction of the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]]. In 1989, the [[West Midlands Serious Crime Squad]] was disbanded as a series of around 100 criminal cases failed or were subsequently overturned in the West Midlands, after new forensic techniques showed police officers had been tampering with statement evidence to secure convictions, including those of the [[Birmingham Six]].\n\nThe Police Complaints Board was replaced by the [[Police Complaints Authority (United Kingdom)|Police Complaints Authority]] in 1985, which itself was superseded by the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] in 2004.

In England and Wales, the vast majority of [[Police Oath#United Kingdom|attested]] [[constables]] enjoy full powers of arrest and search as granted by the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]]. For the purposes of this legislation, \"constables\" is defined to mean all police officers, irrespective of [[Police ranks of the United Kingdom|rank]]. Although police officers have wide-ranging powers, they are still subject to the same laws as members of the public (aside from specific exemptions such as the carrying of firearms and certain road traffic legislation).  There are additional legal restrictions placed on police officers such as the prohibitions on industrial action and on taking part in active politics.\n\n===Types of law enforcement agency===\n{{Main|List of law enforcement agencies in the United Kingdom}}\nThere are three general types of law enforcement agency in the United Kingdom. The first is mostly concerned with policing the general public and their activities and the others are concerned with policing of more specific matters:\n\n* '''Territorial police services''', which carry out the majority of policing. There are 45 [[Territorial police force#United Kingdom|territorial police services]] {{As of|2013|lc=on}} that cover a [[police area]] (a particular region) and have an independent [[police authority]] (England and Wales) or local authority or joint [[police board]] (Scotland). The [[Police Act 1996]], the [[Police (Scotland) Act 1967]] and the [[Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000]], prescribe a number of issues such as appointment of a [[chief constable]], and jurisdiction and responsibilities for police forces in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland respectively. Since the introduction of [[Police and Crime Commissioner]]s in November 2012, the police services in England and Wales no longer have a police authority and this work is done by the police and crime prevention commissioners who are elected every four years. Certain territorial police services have units within them which have a national role, such the Specialist Operations directorate of the Metropolitan Police.\n* '''National law enforcement agencies''', including the [[National Crime Agency]] and [[British Transport Police]] (the latter only operates in Great Britain). The [[Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]] refers to these as \"[[Special police force#United Kingdom|special police forces]]\". The National Crime Agency operates across the United Kingdom (but in Scotland or Northern Ireland requires the agreement of the domestic prosecuting authority to do so) against organised crime and acts as the UK point of contact for foreign agencies. There are also non-police law enforcement agencies whose officers, while not police constables, enforce laws such as the [[Serious Fraud Office (United Kingdom)|Serious Fraud Office]] and [[HM Revenue and Customs]].\n* '''Miscellaneous police services''', mostly having their foundations in older legislation or [[common law]]. These have a responsibility to police specific local areas or activities, such as ports and parks, and before the passing of recent legislation such as the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 were often referred to as \"special police services\"; care must therefore be taken in interpreting historical use of that phrase. These constabularies are not within the scope of the legislation applicable to the previously mentioned organisations but can still be the subject of statutes applicable to, for example, docks, harbours or railways. Until the passing of [[Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003]], the British Transport Police was such a force.\n\nThe [[list of law enforcement agencies in the United Kingdom]] details the various services.\n\n===Cross-jurisdiction powers===\nTerritorial police constables have certain powers of arrest in another one of the [[Legal jurisdictions of the United Kingdom|UK's three legal jurisdictions]] than they were attested in. There are four main provisions for them to do so&nbsp;\u2013 arrest with a warrant, arrest without a warrant for an offence committed in their home jurisdiction whilst in another jurisdiction, arrest without a warrant for an offence committed in another jurisdiction whilst in that jurisdiction, and mutual aid.  A fifth power of cross jurisdictional arrest was introduced by section 116 of the [[Policing and Crime Act 2017]] which fills a loop hole in arrest powers in certain situations.  This power came into force in March 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/227/regulation/2/made/data.htm|title=The Policing and Crime Act 2017 (Commencement No. 7) Regulations 2018|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=2019-01-03}}</ref>  This new power allows a constable from one jurisdiction to arrest without warrant a person suspected of an offence in another jurisdiction whilst in their home jurisdiction.  This power is in relation to more serious offences as listed in the act.  The Act sets out how long the person can be detained in custody by the 'arresting force' in one jurisdiction until constables from the 'investigating force' in another jurisdiction can travel to re-arrest the person and deal accordingly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2017/3/section/116?timeline=true|title=Policing and Crime Act 2017|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|others=Expert Participation|access-date=2017-12-22}}</ref>  Below is a summary of these five powers with a practical example due to the complicated nature of this area of law.

relatively new power was introduced by the Policing and Crime Act 2017 and came into force in March 2018.<ref>{{Cite

suspected of an offence in another jurisdiction without a warrant.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/537277/Factsheet_14b_-_Cross-border_powers.pdf|title=Factsheet 14b - Policing and Crime Bill|last=|first=|date=|website=www.gov.uk|access-date=}}</ref>  Practically this meant that either a warrant had to be applied for, or constables from the investigating force have to travel to the jurisdiction where the person suspected was believed to be, to arrest under the cross border powers set out above.  In urgent and serious cases this caused several issues around delay and suspects evading capture.  This new power allows a constable of one jurisdiction to arrest without warrant a person suspected of an offence in another jurisdiction whilst in their home jurisdiction.  The Act sets out which offences this power of arrest will apply to in each jurisdiction (generally serious offences), and how long the person arrested can be kept in custody, with relevant authorities, by the 'arresting force' to allow sufficient time for officers from the 'investigating force' in another jurisdiction to travel and re-arrest the detained person for the purposes of their investigation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2017/3/section/116?timeline=true|title=Policing and Crime Act 2017|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|others=Expert Participation|access-date=2017-12-22}}</ref>\n\nAs a practical example of this power, a murder is committed in Aberdeen, Scotland.  The suspect immediately travels south over the border into England and is found by constables of [[Cumbria Police]] in Carlisle.  These constables would have a power of arrest in relation to the homicide that occurred in Scotland without the need to have a warrant.\n\n====Other situations (including Mutual Aid)====\nPolice forces often support each other with large-scale operations, such as those that require specialist skills or expertise and those that require policing levels that the host-forces cannot provide. Referred to as mutual aid, constables loaned from one force to another have the powers and privileges of a constable of the host force.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1996/ukpga_19960016_en_6#pt5-pb3-l1g98 |title=section 98, Police Act 1996 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> Constables from the [[Metropolitan Police]] who are on protection duties in Scotland or Northern Ireland have all the powers and privileges of a constable of the host police force.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1996/ukpga_19960016_en_6#pt5-pb3-l1g99 |title=section 99, Police Act 1996 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> A constable who is taking a person to or from a [[prison]] retains all the powers, authority, protection and privileges of his office regardless of his location.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?parentActiveTextDocId=553765&ActiveTextDocId=553798 |title=section 23, Prison Act 1952 |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-28}}</ref> Regardless of where they are in the United Kingdom, a constable may arrest under section 41<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?parentActiveTextDocId=1851852&ActiveTextDocId=1851913 |title=Terrorism Act 2000 |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date=2011-05-27 |accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref> and may stop and search under section 43<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?parentActiveTextDocId=1851852&ActiveTextDocId=1851915 |title=Terrorism Act 2000 |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date=2003-01-04 |accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref> of the [[Terrorism Act 2000]] on suspicion of terrorism (defined by section 40<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?parentActiveTextDocId=1851852&ActiveTextDocId=1851912|title=Terrorism Act 2000|work=statutelaw.gov.uk|accessdate=11 December 2016}}</ref>).\n\n==Powers of officers==\n\n===Territorial police constables===\n[[File:Merseyside and Metropolitan Police officers.JPG|thumb|An officer of the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] with an officer of [[Merseyside Police]] during a Football match between [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham]] at [[Goodison Park]]]]\n[[File:Greater Manchester Police officers in Piccadilly Gardens (Manchester, England) 2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Police Constables and an Inspector of [[Greater Manchester Police]] on the beat in [[Manchester city centre]] after the [[2008 UEFA Cup Final Riots]]]]\nMost police officers are members of [[territorial police forces]]. A person must make a declaration before taking up office as a constable and having any powers; although this is sometimes still known as the [[police oath]], and the process sometimes referred to as \"swearing in\", it now takes the form of an \"attestation\" (in [[England and Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]]) or a \"declaration\" (in [[Scotland]]). The process is carried out in the presence of a magistrate, and is usually followed by the issue of a warrant card. This grants the officer all the powers and privileges, duties and responsibilities of a constable in one of the three distinct legal systems - either England and Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland, and the territorial waters of that country. The limited circumstances where their powers extend across the border are described in the section above.\n\n===Other constables===\nThere are many constables who are not members of territorial police forces. The most notable are members of the three forces referred to as [[special police forces]]: the [[British Transport Police]], [[Ministry of Defence Police]] and [[Civil Nuclear Constabulary]]. Such officers have the \"powers and privileges of a constable\" in matters relating to their work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/ukpga_20030020_en_3#pt3-pb3-l1g31 |title=Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003 (c. 20) |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&title=Energy+Act+2004&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&TYPE=QS&PageNumber=1&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=913408&ActiveTextDocId=913486&filesize=6709 |title=Energy Act 2004 (c. 20) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&title=ministry+police+act&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&TYPE=QS&PageNumber=1&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=602920&ActiveTextDocId=602920&filesize=86516 |title=Ministry of Defence Police Act 1987 (c. 4) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date=1987-03-05 |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> BTP and MDP officers have additional jurisdiction where requested by a constable of another force, in which case they take on that constable's jurisdiction.<ref name=\"statutelaw.gov.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&title=Anti-terrorism%2c+Crime+and+Security+Act+2001&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&TYPE=QS&PageNumber=1&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=267726&ActiveTextDocId=267854&filesize=5059 |title=Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 (c.24) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&title=ministry+police+act&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&TYPE=QS&PageNumber=1&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=602920&ActiveTextDocId=602925&filesize=3566 |title=Ministry of Defence Police Act 1987 (c. 4) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> Upon request from the [[chief police officer]] of a police force, members of one of the above three forces can be given the full powers of constables in the police area of the requesting force.<ref name=\"statutelaw.gov.uk\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&title=Anti-terrorism%2c+Crime+and+Security+Act+2001&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&TYPE=QS&PageNumber=1&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=267726&ActiveTextDocId=267853&filesize=8435 |title=Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 (c.24) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> This was used to supplement police numbers in the areas surrounding the [[2005 G8 summit]] at Gleneagles.\n\nMany acts allow companies or councils to employ constables for a specific purpose.

As a result, they have the full powers of a constable on land owned by the harbour, dock, or port and at any place within one mile of any owned land. There are also forces created by specific legislation, such as the [[Port of Tilbury Police]] ([[Port of London Act 1968]]), [[Mersey Tunnels Police]] (County of Merseyside Act 1989) and the [[Epping Forest Keepers]] (Epping Forest Act 1878).\n\n====Parks Constables====\nUnder Article 18 of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government Provisional Order Confirmation (Greater London Parks and Open Spaces) Act 1967, [[London Borough Council]]s are allowed to swear in council officers as constables for \"securing the observance of the provisions of all enactments relating to open spaces under their control or management and of bye-laws and regulations made thereunder\". Local Authority Parks Constables have all the powers of a constable in relation byelaws regulations and all enactments relating to open spaces, Article 19 of the Act was repealed by section 26(1) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (Local Acts) and the power of arrest for Parks Constables is now contained in Section 24 of P.A.C.E 1984, further amendments to Article 19 covering coming to the aid and assistance of such a constable or officer were repealed by SOCPA 2005, as this provision is already covered in P.A.C.E 1984 (Legal Counsel 2007,2012).\nNo enforcement agency with a power of arrest or detention can operate outside of the provisions of P.A.C.E 1984; therefore all local powers of arrest and detention were brought into line under section 26(1) P.A.C.E 1984.\n\n===Police staff===\nPolice forces employ staff who perform many functions to assist officers and support the smooth running of their police force. They do not hold the office of constable.\nIn England & Wales, the [[chief police officer]] of a territorial police force may designate any person who is employed by the police authority maintaining that force, and is under the direction and control of that chief police officer, as one or more of the following:\n*[[Police Community Support Officer]]\n*Investigating Officer,\n*[[Custody assistant|detention officer]], or\n*Escort Officer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&PageNumber=0&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=112639&ActiveTextDocId=112693&filesize=53565 |title=Police Reform Act 2002 (c. 30) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref>\nThey have a range of powers given by the [[Police Reform Act 2002]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&PageNumber=0&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=112639&ActiveTextDocId=112842&filesize=2720 |title=Police Reform Act 2002 (c. 30) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> and their chief police officer decides which of these powers they may use. Unlike a police constable, a PCSO only has powers when on duty and in uniform, and within the area policed by their respective force.\n\nUntil 1991, parking enforcement was primarily conducted by police-employed [[traffic warden]]s.

Upon successful completion of both parts of the training programme Special Constables are awarded a certificate of achievement and would be eligible to complete an abbreviated course at the Scottish Police College should they later wish to join the [[Police Service of Scotland]] as a regular officer.<ref>Police Service of Scotland - Special Constables Training Page) (accessed 17 August 2014)</ref>\n\n===Organisation of police forces===\nAs all police forces are autonomous organisations there is much variation in organisation and nomenclature, however outlined below are the main strands of policing that makes up police forces:\n\n* All police forces have teams of officers who are responsible for general beat duties and response to emergency and non-emergency calls from the public. These officers are generally the most visible and will invariably be the first interface a member of the public has with police. In general terms these officers will normally patrol by vehicle (though also on foot or bicycle in urban areas). They will generally patrol a sub-division or whole division of a police force area or in the case of the Metropolitan Police Service, a borough. Nearly all police officers begin their careers in this area of policing, with some moving on to more specialist roles. The Metropolitan Police Service calls this area of policing 'Response Teams', whilst other forces use terms such as 'patrol', 'section' and other variations.\n* Most local areas or wards in the country have at least one police officer who is involved in trying to build links with the local community and resolve long-term problems. In London, the Metropolitan Police Service addresses this area of policing with Safer Neighbourhood Teams. This entails each political ward in London having a Police Sergeant, two police constables and a few PCSOs who are ring fenced to address problems and build community links in their respective wards. Other police forces have similar systems but can be named 'Area officers', 'Neighbourhood officers', 'Beat Constables' and a number of other variations.\n* Criminal Investigation Departments (CID) can be found in all police forces. Generally these officers deal with investigations of a more complex, serious nature, however this again can differ from force to force.  Most officers within this area are detectives. Depending on the force in question this area of policing can be further divided into a myriad of other specialist areas such as fraud.  Smaller forces tend to have detectives who deal with a wide range of varied investigations whereas detectives in larger forces can have a very specialist remit.\n* All police forces have specialist departments that deal with certain aspects of policing. Larger forces such as Greater Manchester Police, Strathclyde Police and West Midlands Police have many and varied departments and units such as traffic, firearms, marine, horse, tactical support all named differently depending on the force.  Smaller forces such Dyfed Powys Police and Warwickshire Police will have fewer specialists and will rely on cross training, such as firearms officers also being traffic trained officers. The Metropolitan Police, the largest force in the country, has a large number of specialist departments, some of which are unique to the Metropolitan Police due to policing the capital and its national responsibilities. For example, the [[Diplomatic Protection Group]] and [[Counter Terrorism Command]].\n\n====Fixated Threat Assessment Centre====\n{{main|Fixated Threat Assessment Centre}}\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Fixated Threat Assessment Centre]] is a joint police/mental health unit set up in October 2006 by the [[Home Office]], the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] and [[Metropolitan Police Service]] to identify and address those individuals considered to pose a threat to VIPs or the Royal Family.\n<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article1847697.ece|publisher=The Times|title=VIP 'stalker' squad set up by government|author=Joanna Bale|date=May 27, 2007 | location=London}}</ref> They may then be referred to local health services for further assessment and potential [[involuntary commitment]].

On 1 April 2007 the [[Border and Immigration Agency]] (BIA) was created and commenced operation. However, there were no police officers in the Agency, a matter that attracted considerable criticism when the Agency was established - agency officers have limited powers of arrest.  Further powers for designated officers within the Agency, including powers of detention pending the arrival of a police officer, were introduced by the UK Borders Act 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&title=uk+borders&parentActiveTextDocId=3419168&ActiveTextDocId=3419168&filesize=198579 |title=UK Borders Act 2007 (c. 30) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date=2007-10-30 |accessdate=2009-05-28}}</ref>\n\nThe Government has effectively admitted the shortcomings of the Agency by making a number of fundamental changes within a year of its commencement.

In 2015 a public inquiry under a senior judge was announced. In November 2015 the Metropolitan Police published an unreserved apology in which it exonerated and apologized to those women who had been deceived and stated the methodology had constituted abuse and a \"gross violation\" with severely harmful effects, as part of a settlement of their cases. In 2016 new cases continued to come to light.\n\n====Capacity to solve crimes====\nRecorded crime rose by almost a third in three years to 2018, but charges or summons dropped by 26% and arrests also fell.  Neighbourhood policing capacity has fallen on average by at least a fifth since 2010.  Neighbourhood policing is important in dealing with terrorism and gang crime, especially in communities where the police are distrusted.  [[Yvette Cooper]] said the police were, \"performing a remarkable public service in increasingly difficult circumstances\" though they were, \"badly overstretched\" and responding with difficulty to increasing challenges like online fraud and online child abuse. Only a very small proportion of online fraud cases are investigated and the police are, \"woefully under-resourced\" for the number of online child sexual abuse investigations they must undertake.  Che Donald of the Police Federation of England and Wales said the government should acknowledge the, \"true cost of policing\" or officers would be unable to keep the public safe.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-45970761 Overstretched police risk becoming 'irrelevant', MPs warn] ''[[BBC]]''</ref>\n\n===Police sex abuse allegations===\nIn 2016, allegations of serious [[sexual abuse]] were made against hundreds of police officers in England and Wales, with several forces in England and Wales receiving 436 allegations of abuse of power for sexual gain against 436 police officers, including 20 [[police community support officer]]s and eight staff in the two years to March 2016.<ref name=hundreds>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/12/08/hundreds-police-reprieved-sex-abuse-claims-forces-fail-take/|title=Hundreds of police officers 'getting away with sexual abuse of crime victims'|work=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=11 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/dec/08/hundreds-police-officers-accused-sex-abuse-inquiry-finds|title=Hundreds of police in England and Wales accused of sexual abuse|first=Jamie|last=Grierson|date=8 December 2016|publisher=|accessdate=11 December 2016|via=The Guardian}}</ref> Mike Cunningham, inspector of constabulary and former chief constable of Staffordshire police said: \u201cIt's the most serious form of corruption.

The Association of Police and Crime Commissioner sent a letter to Home Secretary, Sajid Javid stressing the need for co-operation with European policing and justice organizations after March 2019.

He campaigned for [[Catholic emancipation]]\u2014including the right for Catholics to sit in the [[Westminster Parliament]], denied for over 100 years\u2014and repeal of the [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union]] which combined [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain and Ireland]].\n\nThroughout his career in Irish politics, O'Connell was able to gain a large following among the Irish masses in support of him and his [[Catholic Association]]. O'Connell's main strategy was one of political [[reformism]], working within the parliamentary structures of the British state in Ireland and forming an alliance of convenience with the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]]. More radical elements broke with O'Connell to found the [[Young Ireland]] movement.\n\n==Early life==\nO'Connell was born at Carhan near [[Cahersiveen]], [[County Kerry]], to the [[O'Connells of Derrynane]], a wealthy Roman Catholic family  that had been dispossessed of its lands. His parents were Morgan O'Connell  and Catherine O'Mullane. Among his uncles was [[Daniel Charles, Count O'Connell]], an officer in the Irish Brigades of the [[French Army]].  A famous aunt was [[Eibhl\u00edn Dubh N\u00ed Chonaill]], while [[Sir James O'Connell, 1st Baronet]], was his younger brother.  Under the patronage of his wealthy bachelor uncle [[Maurice O'Connell (Hunting Cap)|Maurice \"Hunting Cap\" O'Connell]]. O'Connell was first sent with his brother Maurice to Reddington Academy at Long Island, near Queenstown (Cobh)<ref>J. J. Fr.

O'Kelly \"O'Connell Calling: the Liberator\u2019s place in the world\" (Kerryman, 1949)</ref> They both studied at [[Douai]] in France from 1790 and O'Connell was admitted as a [[barrister]] to [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1794, transferring to [[Dublin]]'s [[King's Inns]] two years later. In his early years, he became acquainted with the pro-democracy radicals of the time and committed himself to bringing equal rights and religious tolerance to his own country.<ref name=\"Boylan1998\">{{cite book | last = Boylan | first = Henry | year = 1998 | title = A Dictionary of Irish Biography | edition = 3rd | page = 306 | location = Dublin | publisher = Gill and MacMillan | isbn = 0-7171-2945-4 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:O'Connells Home At Derrynane Abby.JPG|thumb|left|O'Connell's home at [[Derrynane House|Derrynane]]]]\nWhile in Dublin studying for the law, O'Connell was under his Uncle Maurice's instructions not to become involved in any militia activity. When [[Theobald Wolfe Tone|Wolfe Tone]]'s [[Wolfe Tone#Hoche's expedition and the 1798 rebellion|French invasion fleet]] entered [[Bantry Bay]] in December 1796, O'Connell found himself in a quandary. Politics was the cause of his unsettlement.<ref name=\"Gywnn\">\nDennis Gywnn, ''Daniel O'Connell The Irish Liberator'', Hutchinson & Co. Ltd pg 71</ref> Dennis Gwynn in his ''Daniel O'Connell: The Irish Liberator'' suggests that the unsettlement was because he was enrolled as a volunteer in defence of Government, yet the Government was intensifying its persecution of the Catholic people\u2014of which he was one.<ref name=\"Gywnn\" /> He desired to enter Parliament, yet every allowance that the Catholics had been led to anticipate, two years previously, was now flatly vetoed.<ref name=\"Gywnn\" />\n\nAs a law student, O'Connell was aware of his own talents, but the higher ranks of the Bar were closed to him. He read the ''[[Jockey Club]]'' as a picture of the governing class in England and was persuaded by it that, \"vice reigns triumphant in the English court at this day. The spirit of [[liberty]] shrinks to protect property from the attacks of French innovators. The corrupt higher orders tremble for their vicious enjoyments.\"<ref name=\"Gywnn\" />\n\nO'Connell's studies at the time had concentrated upon the legal and political history of Ireland, and the debates of the Historical Society concerned the records of governments, and from this he was to conclude, according to one of his biographers, \"in Ireland the whole policy of the Government was to repress the people and to maintain the ascendancy of a privileged and corrupt minority\".<ref name=\"Gywnn\" />\n\nOn 3 January 1797, in an atmosphere of alarm over the French invasion fleet in Bantry Bay, he wrote to his uncle saying that he was the last of his colleagues to join a volunteer corps and \"being young, active, healthy and single\" he could offer no plausible excuse.<ref>O'Connell Correspondence, Vol I, Letter No. 24a</ref> Later that month, for the sake of expediency, he joined the Lawyers' Artillery Corps.<ref>O'Ferrall, F., ''Daniel O'Connell, Dublin'', 1981, p. 12</ref>\n\nOn 19 May 1798, O'Connell was called to the [[Irish Bar]] and became a [[barrister]]. Four days later, the [[Society of the United Irishmen|United Irishmen]] staged their [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|rebellion]] which was put down by the British with great bloodshed. O'Connell did not support the rebellion; he believed that the Irish would have to assert themselves politically rather than by force.\n\nHe went on the [[Munster]] circuit, and for over a decade, he went into a fairly quiet period of private law practice in the south of Ireland.<ref name=\"Boylan1998\" /> He was reputed to have the largest income of any Irish barrister but, due to natural extravagance and a growing family, was usually in debt; his brother remarked caustically that Daniel was in debt all his life from the age of seventeen. Although he was ultimately to inherit Derrynane from his uncle Maurice, the old man lived to be almost 100 and in the event Daniel's inheritance did not cover his debts.\n\nHe also condemned [[Robert Emmet]]'s [[Irish Rebellion of 1803|Rebellion of 1803]]. Of Emmet, a Protestant, he wrote: \"A man who could coolly prepare so much bloodshed, so many murders\u2014and such horrors of every kind has ceased to be an object of compassion.\"<ref>O'Connell Correspondence, Vol I, Letter No. 97</ref>\n\nDespite his opposition to the use of violence, he was willing to defend those accused of political crimes, particularly if he suspected that they had been falsely accused, as in the [[Doneraile]] conspiracy trials of 1829, his last notable court appearance. He was noted for his fearlessness in court: if he thought poorly of a judge (as was very often the case) he had no hesitation in making this clear. Most famous perhaps was his retort to [[James McClelland (Solicitor-General)|Baron McClelland]], who had said that as a barrister he would never have taken the course O'Connell had adopted: O'Connell said that McClelland had never been his model as a barrister, neither would he take directions from him as a judge.<ref>O'Faol\u00e1in, Sean (1936). ''King of the Beggars: a life of Daniel O'Connell''. Alan Figgis reissue, p. 97</ref> He did not lack the ambition to become a judge himself: in particular he was attracted by the position of [[Master of the Rolls in Ireland]], yet although he was offered it more than once, finally refused.\n\n==Family==\n[[File:Mary O'Connell.tif|thumb| 1836 Portrait of Mary O'Connell by John Gubbins]]\n[[File:Daniel O'Connell.png|thumb|left|Daniel O'Connell, in an 1836 watercolour by Bernard Mulrenin. <!--''Daniel O'Connell'', 1836, by [[Bernard Mulrenin]]-->]]\n[[File:St Patricks Cathedral (Daniel O'Connell Statue).jpg|thumb|Statue of Daniel O'Connell outside [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne]]|alt=]]In 1802 O'Connell married his third cousin, [[Mary O'Connell (1778-1836)|Mary O'Connell]]. It was a love marriage, and to persist in it was an act of considerable courage, since Daniel's uncle Maurice was outraged (as Mary had no fortune) and for a time threatened to disinherit them.<ref>Geoghegan  ''King Dan''  pp.94\u20137</ref> They had four daughters (three surviving), [[Ellen Bridget O'Connell|Ellen]] (1805\u20131883), Catherine (1808), Elizabeth (1810), and Rickarda (1815) and four sons.

The marriage was happy and Mary's death in 1837 was a blow from which her husband never fully recovered. He was a devoted father; O'Faol\u00e1in suggests that despite his wide acquaintance he had few close friends and therefore the family circle meant a great deal to him.<ref>O'Faol\u00e1in p.87</ref>\n\n=== O'Connell's Ale and connection with the 'licensed trade' ===\nO'Connell assisted his younger son, Daniel junior, to acquire the Phoenix Brewery in James's Street, Dublin in 1831.<ref>''Irish Whiskey: A 1000 Year Tradition'', Malachy Magee, O'Brien Press, Dublin, {{ISBN|0-86278-228-7}}. pg 68\u201374.</ref> The brewery produced a brand known as \"O'Connell's Ale\" and enjoyed some popularity. By 1832, O'Connell was forced to state that he would not be a political patron of the brewing trade or his son's company, until he was no longer a member of parliament, particularly because O'Connell and [[Arthur Guinness]] were political enemies. Guinness was the \"moderate\" liberal candidate, O'Connell was the \"radical\" liberal candidate. The rivalry caused dozens of Irish firms to boycott Guinness during the 1841 Repeal election. It was at this time that Guinness was accused of supporting the \"Orange system\", and its beer was known as \"Protestant porter\". When the O'Connell family left brewing, the rights to \"O'Connell Dublin Ale\" was sold to John D'Arcy. The brewing business proved to be unsuccessful though, and after a few years was taken over by the manager, John Brennan, while Daniel junior embraced a political career. Brennan changed the name back to the Phoenix Brewery but continued to brew and sell O'Connell's Ale. When the Phoenix Brewery was effectively closed after being absorbed into the Guinness complex in 1909, the brewing of O'Connell's Ale was carried out by John D'Arcy and Son Ltd at the Anchor Brewery in Usher Street. In 1926, D'Arcy's ceased trading and the firm of Watkins, Jameson and Pim carried on the brewing until they too succumbed to the pressures of trying to compete with Guinness.<ref>T. Halpin: History of the Irish Brewing Industry, 1988</ref><ref name=\"sim\">[http://www.simtec.us/dublinbrewing/history.html History of Brewing in Dublin]</ref>\n\nDaniel junior was the committee chairman of the licensed trade association of the period and gave considerable and valuable support to Daniel O'Connell in his public life. Some time later a quarrel arose and O'Connell turned his back on the association and became a strong advocate of [[temperance movement|temperance]]. During the period of [[Theobald Mathew (temperance reformer)|Fr. Mathew]]'s total abstinence crusades many temperance rallies were held, the most notable being a huge rally held on [[St. Patrick's Day]] in 1841. Daniel O'Connell was a guest of honour at another such rally held at the [[Rotunda Hospital]].<ref name=\"sim\" /><ref>St Martin Magazine (ISSN 1393-1008), June 2003 St Martin Apostolate, Dublin</ref>\n\n== Political beliefs and programme ==\n[[File:Daniel O'Connell2.jpg|thumb|\"Daniel O'Connell: The Champion of Liberty\" poster published in [[Pennsylvania]], 1847]]\n\nA critic of violent insurrection ''in Ireland'', O'Connell once said that \"the altar of liberty totters when it is cemented only with blood\", and yet as late as 1841, O'Connell had whipped his MPs into line to keep the [[First Opium War|(First) Opium War]] going in China. The Tories at the time had proposed a motion of censure over the war, and O'Connell had to call upon his MPs to support the Whig Government. As a result of this intervention, the Government was saved.<ref>''[[Charles Gavan Duffy]]: Conversations With Carlyle (1892), with Introduction, Stray Thoughts on Young Ireland'', Brendan Clifford, Athol Books, Belfast, {{ISBN|0-85034-114-0}}.pg 17 &21</ref>\n\nPolitically, he focused on parliamentary and populist methods to force change and made regular declarations of his loyalty to the British Crown. He often warned the British establishment that if they did not reform the governance of Ireland, Irishmen would start to listen to the \"counsels of violent men\". Successive British governments continued to ignore this advice, long after his death, although he succeeded in extracting by the sheer force of will and the power of the Catholic peasants and clergy much of what he wanted, i.e., eliminating disabilities on Roman Catholics; ensuring that lawfully elected Roman Catholics could serve their constituencies in the British Parliament (until the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] was restored); and amending the Oath of Allegiance so as to remove clauses offensive to Roman Catholics who could then take the Oath in good conscience.<ref name=\"Boylan1998\" />\n\nAlthough a native speaker of the [[Irish language]], O'Connell encouraged Irish people to learn English to better themselves.<ref name=\"Boylan1998\" /> Although he is best known for the campaign for Catholic emancipation; he also supported similar efforts for Irish Jews. At his insistence, in 1846, the British law \"[[History of the Jews in Ireland#18th and 19th century|De Judaismo]]\", which prescribed a special dress for Jews, was repealed. O'Connell said: \"Ireland has claims on your ancient race, it is the only country that I know of unsullied by any one act of persecution of the Jews\".<ref>[http://www.jewishireland.org/history_2.html Jewish Ireland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100222092245/http://www.jewishireland.org/history_2.html|date=22 February 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Campaigning for Catholic emancipation ==\nO'Connell returned to politics in the 1810s. In 1811, he established the Catholic Board, which campaigned for [[Catholic emancipation]], that is, the opportunity for Irish Catholics to become members of parliament. In 1823, he set up the [[Catholic Association]] which embraced other aims to better Irish Catholics, such as: electoral reform, reform of the [[Church of Ireland]], tenants' rights, and economic development.<ref>Paul Adelmann and Robert Pearce, ''Great Britain and the Irish Question 1798\u20131922'', Hodder Murray, London, {{ISBN|0-340-88901-2}}, p. 33</ref>\n\nThe Association was funded by membership dues of one penny per month, a minimal amount designed to attract Catholic peasants. The subscription was highly successful, and the Association raised a large sum of money in its first year. The money was used to campaign for Catholic emancipation, specifically funding pro-emancipation members of parliament (MPs) standing for the [[British House of Commons]].<ref>Geoghegan, Patrick M. (2008). ''King Dan''. Gill and Macmillan, Dublin, p. 168</ref>\n\nThe Crown moved to suppress the Association by a series of prosecutions, with mixed success. O'Connell was often briefed for the defence, and showed extraordinary vigour in pleading the rights of Catholics to argue for emancipation. He clashed repeatedly with [[William Saurin]], the [[Attorney General for Ireland]] and most influential figure in the Dublin administration, and political differences between the two men were fuelled by a bitter personal antipathy.<ref>O'Faol\u00e1in pp. 151\u2013179</ref>\n\nIn 1815 a serious event in his life occurred. [[Dublin Corporation]] was considered a stronghold of the [[Protestant Ascendancy]] and O'Connell, in an 1815 speech, referred to it as a \"beggarly corporation\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Millingen|first=John Gideon|title=The history of duelling: including, narratives of the most remarkable personal encounters that have taken place from the earliest period to the present time, Volume 2|year=1841|publisher=R.

The duel had filled [[Dublin Castle]] (from where the [[Dublin Castle administration|British Government administered Ireland]]) with tense excitement at the prospect that O'Connell would be killed. They regarded O'Connell as \"worse than a public nuisance\", and would have welcomed any prospect of seeing him removed at this time.<ref name=\"Dennis Gywnn Pg 138-145\">Dennis Gywnn, ''Daniel O'Connell The Irish Liberator'', Hutchinson & Co. Ltd pp 138\u2013145</ref>\n\nO'Connell met D'Esterre and [[Oughter Ard#Duel|mortally wounded him]] (he was shot in the hip, the bullet then lodging in his stomach), in a duel at [[Oughterard, County Kildare]]. His conscience was bitterly sore by the fact that, not only had he killed a man, but he had left his family almost destitute.<ref>Geoghegan, ''King Dan''  p. 155</ref>\n\nO'Connell offered to \"share his income\" with D'Esterre's widow, but she declined; however, she consented to accept an allowance for her daughter, which O'Connell regularly paid for more than thirty years until his death. The memory of the duel haunted him for the remainder of his life, and he refused ever to fight another, being prepared to risk accusations of cowardice rather than kill again.<ref name=\"Dennis Gywnn Pg 138-145\" />\n\nAs part of his campaign for Catholic emancipation, O'Connell created the Catholic Association in 1823; this organisation acted as a pressure group against the British government so as to achieve emancipation. The [[Catholic Rent]], which was established in 1824 by O'Connell and the Catholic Church raised funds from which O'Connell was able to help finance the Catholic Association in its push for emancipation. Official opinion was gradually swinging towards emancipation, as shown by the summary dismissal of William Saurin, the Attorney General and a leading opponent of religious toleration, whom O'Connell called \"our mortal foe\".\n\nO'Connell stood in a [[1828 Clare by-election|by-election]] to the British House of Commons in 1828 for [[Clare (UK Parliament constituency)|County Clare]] against [[William Vesey-FitzGerald, 2nd Baron FitzGerald and Vesey|William Vesey Fitzgerald]], who had just joined the British Cabinet as President of the Board of Trade. By law at the time, Cabinet office was deemed to be \"an office of profit\" under the Crown, requiring the promoted man to obtain the endorsement of his constituents by standing for re-election.\n\nAfter O'Connell won election, he was unable to take his seat as members of parliament had to take the [[Oath of Supremacy]], which was incompatible with Catholicism. The Prime Minister, the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], and the [[Home Secretary]], Sir [[Robert Peel]], even though they opposed Catholic participation in Parliament, saw that denying O'Connell his seat would cause outrage and could lead to another rebellion or uprising in Ireland, which was about 85% Catholic.<ref>Oliver MacDonagh (1991), ''The Life of Daniel O'Connell''</ref>\n\nPeel and Wellington managed to convince [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]] that Catholic emancipation and the right of Catholics and [[Presbyterian]]s and members of all Christian faiths other than the established [[Church of Ireland]] to sit in Parliament needed to be established; with the help of the [[Whig (British political party)|Whigs]], the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829|Catholic Relief Act]] became law in 1829.\n\nHowever, the Emancipation Act was not made retroactive, meaning that O'Connell had either to seek re-election or to attempt to take the oath of supremacy. When O'Connell attempted on 15 May to take his seat without taking the oath of supremacy,  Solicitor-General [[Nicholas Conyngham Tindal]] moved that his seat be declared vacant and another election ordered; O'Connell was elected unopposed on 30 July 1829.<ref name=\"Hist Parl\">''[[The History of Parliament]] 1820\u20131832'' vol VI pp. 535\u2013536.</ref>\n\nHe took his seat when Parliament resumed in February 1830, by which time [[Henry Charles Howard, 13th Duke of Norfolk]] and Earl of Surrey, had already become the first Roman Catholic to have taken advantage of the Emancipation Act and sit in Parliament.<ref name=\"Not first\">''[[History of Parliament]] 1820\u20131832'' vol I p. 253.</ref><ref name=\"Not first2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.deskeenan.com/1GrChap8.htm|title=The Grail Chapter Eight|work=deskeenan.com}}</ref>\n\n\"Wellington is the King of England\", King George IV once complained, \"O'Connell is King of Ireland, and I am only the dean of Windsor.\" The regal jest expressed the general admiration for O'Connell at the height of his career.\n\nThe Catholic emancipation campaign led by O'Connell served as the precedent and model for the emancipation of [[British Jews]], the subsequent [[Jews Relief Act 1858]] allowing Jewish MPs to omit the words in the [[Oath of Allegiance]] \"and I make this Declaration upon the true Faith of a Christian\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/21-22/49/enacted|title=Jews Relief Act 1858|work=legislation.gov.uk}}</ref> O'Connell himself was an opponent of the persecution of Jews praising Ireland as the \"only Christian country that I know of unsullied by any one act of persecution of the Jews.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://books.google.com/?id=CkULAAAAIAAJ&q=Ireland+has+claims+on+your+ancient+race,+it+is+the+only+country+that+I+know+of+unsullied+by+any+one+act+of+persecution+of+the+Jews%E2%80%9D&dq=Ireland+has+claims+on+your+ancient+race,+it+is+the+only+country+that+I+know+of+unsullied+by+any+one+act+of+persecution+of+the+Jews%E2%80%9D | title=Transactions - the Jewish Historical Society of England| year=1908}}</ref>\n\n===Comments on emancipation===\n[[Michael Doheny]], in his ''The Felon's Track'', says that the very character of emancipation has assumed an \"exaggerated and false guise\" and that it is an error to call it emancipation.

There was an obligation for those working the land to support the established Church (i.e., the [[United Church of England and Ireland]]) by payments known as [[tithes]].

Nonetheless O'Connell rejected [[William Sharman Crawford]]'s call for the complete abolition of tithes in 1838, as he felt he could not embarrass the Whigs (the [[Lichfield House Compact]] secured an alliance between Whigs, radicals and Irish MPs in 1835).<ref name=ste/> In 1838, parliament introduced a {{anchor|Tithe Commutation Act}}Tithe Commutation Act for Ireland.<ref>{{cite book|editor1=Moody, T.

They in turn were to pass payment to the authorities. Tithes were thus effectively added to a tenant's rent payment. This partial relief and elimination of the confrontational collections ended the violent aspect of the Tithe War.\n\nFull relief from the tax was not achieved until the [[Irish Church Act 1869]], which disestablished the Church of Ireland, by the [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] government.\n\nIn 1841, Daniel O'Connell became the first Roman Catholic [[Lord Mayor of Dublin]] since the reign of [[James II of England|James II]], who had been the last Roman Catholic monarch of England, Ireland and Scotland.<ref name=\"Boylan1998\" />\n\n==Campaign for repeal of the Union==\n[[Image:The Monster Meeting at Clifden in 1843.png|thumb|''The Monster Meeting at [[Clifden]] in 1843'' by [[Joseph Patrick Haverty]].

Despite appeals from his supporters, O'Connell refused to defy the authorities and he called off the meeting, as he was unwilling to risk bloodshed and had no others.<ref name=\"Boylan1998\" /> He was arrested, charged with conspiracy and sentenced to a year's imprisonment and a fine of \u00a32,000, although he was released after three months by the [[House of Lords]], which quashed the conviction and severely criticised the unfairness of the trial.

'''The Emancipator''',<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/ashorthistory/archive/intro177.shtml A Short History of Ireland]</ref> was an Irish political leader in the first half of the 19th century. He campaigned for [[Catholic emancipation]]\u2014including the right for Catholics to sit in the [[Westminster Parliament]], denied for over 100 years\u2014and repeal of the [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union]] which combined [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain and Ireland]].\n\nThroughout his career in Irish politics, O'Connell was able to gain a large following among the Irish masses in support of him and his [[Catholic Association]]. O'Connell's main strategy was one of political [[reformism]], working within the parliamentary structures of the British state in Ireland and forming an alliance of convenience with the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]]. More radical elements broke with O'Connell to found the [[Young Ireland]] movement.\n\n==Early life==\nO'Connell was born at Carhan near [[Cahersiveen]], [[County Kerry]], to the [[O'Connells of Derrynane]], a wealthy Roman Catholic family  that had been dispossessed of its lands. His parents were Morgan O'Connell  and Catherine O'Mullane. Among his uncles was [[Daniel Charles, Count O'Connell]], an officer in the Irish Brigades of the [[French Army]].  A famous aunt was [[Eibhl\u00edn Dubh N\u00ed Chonaill]], while [[Sir James O'Connell, 1st Baronet]], was his younger brother.  Under the patronage of his wealthy bachelor uncle [[Maurice O'Connell (Hunting Cap)|Maurice \"Hunting Cap\" O'Connell]]. O'Connell was first sent with his brother Maurice to Reddington Academy at Long Island, near Queenstown (Cobh)<ref>J. J. Fr. Harrington's Reddington Academy Walterstown (Baile Ualtair) is a townland in Cobh Rural ED, in Templerobin Civil Parish, in Barony, in Co. Cork, Ireland. O'Kelly \"O'Connell Calling: the Liberator\u2019s place in the world\" (Kerryman, 1949)</ref> They both studied at [[Douai]] in France from 1790 and O'Connell was admitted as a [[barrister]] to [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1794, transferring to [[Dublin]]'s [[King's Inns]] two years later. In his early years, he became acquainted with the pro-democracy radicals of the time and committed himself to bringing equal rights and religious tolerance to his own country.<ref name=\"Boylan1998\">{{cite book | last = Boylan | first = Henry | year = 1998 | title = A Dictionary of Irish Biography | edition = 3rd | page = 306 | location = Dublin | publisher = Gill and MacMillan | isbn = 0-7171-2945-4 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:O'Connells Home At Derrynane Abby.JPG|thumb|left|O'Connell's home at [[Derrynane House|Derrynane]]]]\nWhile in Dublin studying for the law, O'Connell was under his Uncle Maurice's instructions not to become involved in any militia activity. When [[Theobald Wolfe Tone|Wolfe Tone]]'s [[Wolfe Tone#Hoche's expedition and the 1798 rebellion|French invasion fleet]] entered [[Bantry Bay]] in December 1796, O'Connell found himself in a quandary. Politics was the cause of his unsettlement.<ref name=\"Gywnn\">\nDennis Gywnn, ''Daniel O'Connell The Irish Liberator'', Hutchinson & Co. Ltd pg 71</ref> Dennis Gwynn in his ''Daniel O'Connell: The Irish Liberator'' suggests that the unsettlement was because he was enrolled as a volunteer in defence of Government, yet the Government was intensifying its persecution of the Catholic people\u2014of which he was one.<ref name=\"Gywnn\" /> He desired to enter Parliament, yet every allowance that the Catholics had been led to anticipate, two years previously, was now flatly vetoed.<ref name=\"Gywnn\" />\n\nAs a law student, O'Connell was aware of his own talents, but the higher ranks of the Bar were closed to him. He read the ''[[Jockey Club]]'' as a picture of the governing class in England and was persuaded by it that, \"vice reigns triumphant in the English court at this day. The spirit of [[liberty]] shrinks to protect property from the attacks of French innovators. The corrupt higher orders tremble for their vicious enjoyments.\"<ref name=\"Gywnn\" />\n\nO'Connell's studies at the time had concentrated upon the legal and political history of Ireland, and the debates of the Historical Society concerned the records of governments, and from this he was to conclude, according to one of his biographers, \"in Ireland the whole policy of the Government was to repress the people and to maintain the ascendancy of a privileged and corrupt minority\".<ref name=\"Gywnn\" />\n\nOn 3 January 1797, in an atmosphere of alarm over the French invasion fleet in Bantry Bay, he wrote to his uncle saying that he was the last of his colleagues to join a volunteer corps and \"being young, active, healthy and single\" he could offer no plausible excuse.<ref>O'Connell Correspondence, Vol I, Letter No. 24a</ref> Later that month, for the sake of expediency, he joined the Lawyers' Artillery Corps.<ref>O'Ferrall, F., ''Daniel O'Connell, Dublin'', 1981, p. 12</ref>\n\nOn 19 May 1798, O'Connell was called to the [[Irish Bar]] and became a [[barrister]]. Four days later, the [[Society of the United Irishmen|United Irishmen]] staged their [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|rebellion]] which was put down by the British with great bloodshed. O'Connell did not support the rebellion; he believed that the Irish would have to assert themselves politically rather than by force.\n\nHe went on the [[Munster]] circuit, and for over a decade, he went into a fairly quiet period of private law practice in the south of Ireland.<ref name=\"Boylan1998\" /> He was reputed to have the largest income of any Irish barrister but, due to natural extravagance and a growing family, was usually in debt; his brother remarked caustically that Daniel was in debt all his life from the age of seventeen. Although he was ultimately to inherit Derrynane from his uncle Maurice, the old man lived to be almost 100 and in the event Daniel's inheritance did not cover his debts.\n\nHe also condemned [[Robert Emmet]]'s [[Irish Rebellion of 1803|Rebellion of 1803]]. Of Emmet, a Protestant, he wrote: \"A man who could coolly prepare so much bloodshed, so many murders\u2014and such horrors of every kind has ceased to be an object of compassion.\"<ref>O'Connell Correspondence, Vol I, Letter No. 97</ref>\n\nDespite his opposition to the use of violence, he was willing to defend those accused of political crimes, particularly if he suspected that they had been falsely accused, as in the [[Doneraile]] conspiracy trials of 1829, his last notable court appearance. He was noted for his fearlessness in court: if he thought poorly of a judge (as was very often the case) he had no hesitation in making this clear. Most famous perhaps was his retort to [[James McClelland (Solicitor-General)|Baron McClelland]], who had said that as a barrister he would never have taken the course O'Connell had adopted: O'Connell said that McClelland had never been his model as a barrister, neither would he take directions from him as a judge.<ref>O'Faol\u00e1in, Sean (1936). ''King of the Beggars: a life of Daniel O'Connell''. Alan Figgis reissue, p. 97</ref> He did not lack the ambition to become a judge himself: in particular he was attracted by the position of [[Master of the Rolls in Ireland]], yet although he was offered it more than once, finally refused.\n\n==Family==\n[[File:Mary O'Connell.tif|thumb| 1836 Portrait of Mary O'Connell by John Gubbins]]\n[[File:Daniel O'Connell.png|thumb|left|Daniel O'Connell, in an 1836 watercolour by Bernard Mulrenin. <!--''Daniel O'Connell'', 1836, by [[Bernard Mulrenin]]-->]]\n[[File:St Patricks Cathedral (Daniel O'Connell Statue).jpg|thumb|Statue of Daniel O'Connell outside [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne]]|alt=]]In 1802 O'Connell married his third cousin, [[Mary O'Connell (1778-1836)|Mary O'Connell]]. It was a love marriage, and to persist in it was an act of considerable courage, since Daniel's uncle Maurice was outraged (as Mary had no fortune) and for a time threatened to disinherit them.<ref>Geoghegan  ''King Dan''  pp.94\u20137</ref> They had four daughters (three surviving), [[Ellen Bridget O'Connell|Ellen]] (1805\u20131883), Catherine (1808), Elizabeth (1810), and Rickarda (1815) and four sons. The sons\u2014[[Maurice O'Connell (MP)|Maurice]] (1803), [[Morgan O'Connell|Morgan]]  (1804), [[John O'Connell (MP)|John]] (1810), and [[Daniel O'Connell Jnr|Daniel]] (1816)\u2014all sat in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]. The marriage was happy and Mary's death in 1837 was a blow from which her husband never fully recovered. He was a devoted father; O'Faol\u00e1in suggests that despite his wide acquaintance he had few close friends and therefore the family circle meant a great deal to him.<ref>O'Faol\u00e1in p.87</ref>\n\n=== O'Connell's Ale and connection with the 'licensed trade' ===\nO'Connell assisted his younger son, Daniel junior, to acquire the Phoenix Brewery in James's Street, Dublin in 1831.<ref>''Irish Whiskey: A 1000 Year Tradition'', Malachy Magee, O'Brien Press, Dublin, {{ISBN|0-86278-228-7}}. pg 68\u201374.</ref> The brewery produced a brand known as \"O'Connell's Ale\" and enjoyed some popularity. By 1832, O'Connell was forced to state that he would not be a political patron of the brewing trade or his son's company, until he was no longer a member of parliament, particularly because O'Connell and [[Arthur Guinness]] were political enemies. Guinness was the \"moderate\" liberal candidate, O'Connell was the \"radical\" liberal candidate. The rivalry caused dozens of Irish firms to boycott Guinness during the 1841 Repeal election. It was at this time that Guinness was accused of supporting the \"Orange system\", and its beer was known as \"Protestant porter\". When the O'Connell family left brewing, the rights to \"O'Connell Dublin Ale\" was sold to John D'Arcy. The brewing business proved to be unsuccessful though, and after a few years was taken over by the manager, John Brennan, while Daniel junior embraced a political career. Brennan changed the name back to the Phoenix Brewery but continued to brew and sell O'Connell's Ale. When the Phoenix Brewery was effectively closed after being absorbed into the Guinness complex in 1909, the brewing of O'Connell's Ale was carried out by John D'Arcy and Son Ltd at the Anchor Brewery in Usher Street. In 1926, D'Arcy's ceased trading and the firm of Watkins, Jameson and Pim carried on the brewing until they too succumbed to the pressures of trying to compete with Guinness.<ref>T. Halpin: History of the Irish Brewing Industry, 1988</ref><ref name=\"sim\">[http://www.simtec.us/dublinbrewing/history.html History of Brewing in Dublin]</ref>\n\nDaniel junior was the committee chairman of the licensed trade association of the period and gave considerable and valuable support to Daniel O'Connell in his public life. Some time later a quarrel arose and O'Connell turned his back on the association and became a strong advocate of [[temperance movement|temperance]]. During the period of [[Theobald Mathew (temperance reformer)|Fr. Mathew]]'s total abstinence crusades many temperance rallies were held, the most notable being a huge rally held on [[St. Patrick's Day]] in 1841. Daniel O'Connell was a guest of honour at another such rally held at the [[Rotunda Hospital]].<ref name=\"sim\" /><ref>St Martin Magazine (ISSN 1393-1008), June 2003 St Martin Apostolate, Dublin</ref>\n\n== Political beliefs and programme ==\n[[File:Daniel O'Connell2.jpg|thumb|\"Daniel O'Connell: The Champion of Liberty\" poster published in [[Pennsylvania]], 1847]]\n\nA critic of violent insurrection ''in Ireland'', O'Connell once said that \"the altar of liberty totters when it is cemented only with blood\", and yet as late as 1841, O'Connell had whipped his MPs into line to keep the [[First Opium War|(First) Opium War]] going in China. The Tories at the time had proposed a motion of censure over the war, and O'Connell had to call upon his MPs to support the Whig Government. As a result of this intervention, the Government was saved.<ref>''[[Charles Gavan Duffy]]: Conversations With Carlyle (1892), with Introduction, Stray Thoughts on Young Ireland'', Brendan Clifford, Athol Books, Belfast, {{ISBN|0-85034-114-0}}.pg 17 &21</ref>\n\nPolitically, he focused on parliamentary and populist methods to force change and made regular declarations of his loyalty to the British Crown. He often warned the British establishment that if they did not reform the governance of Ireland, Irishmen would start to listen to the \"counsels of violent men\". Successive British governments continued to ignore this advice, long after his death, although he succeeded in extracting by the sheer force of will and the power of the Catholic peasants and clergy much of what he wanted, i.e., eliminating disabilities on Roman Catholics; ensuring that lawfully elected Roman Catholics could serve their constituencies in the British Parliament (until the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] was restored); and amending the Oath of Allegiance so as to remove clauses offensive to Roman Catholics who could then take the Oath in good conscience.<ref name=\"Boylan1998\" />\n\nAlthough a native speaker of the [[Irish language]], O'Connell encouraged Irish people to learn English to better themselves.<ref name=\"Boylan1998\" /> Although he is best known for the campaign for Catholic emancipation; he also supported similar efforts for Irish Jews. At his insistence, in 1846, the British law \"[[History of the Jews in Ireland#18th and 19th century|De Judaismo]]\", which prescribed a special dress for Jews, was repealed. O'Connell said: \"Ireland has claims on your ancient race, it is the only country that I know of unsullied by any one act of persecution of the Jews\".<ref>[http://www.jewishireland.org/history_2.html Jewish Ireland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100222092245/http://www.jewishireland.org/history_2.html|date=22 February 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Campaigning for Catholic emancipation ==\nO'Connell returned to politics in the 1810s. In 1811, he established the Catholic Board, which campaigned for [[Catholic emancipation]], that is, the opportunity for Irish Catholics to become members of parliament. In 1823, he set up the [[Catholic Association]] which embraced other aims to better Irish Catholics, such as: electoral reform, reform of the [[Church of Ireland]], tenants' rights, and economic development.<ref>Paul Adelmann and Robert Pearce, ''Great Britain and the Irish Question 1798\u20131922'', Hodder Murray, London, {{ISBN|0-340-88901-2}}, p. 33</ref>\n\nThe Association was funded by membership dues of one penny per month, a minimal amount designed to attract Catholic peasants. The subscription was highly successful, and the Association raised a large sum of money in its first year. The money was used to campaign for Catholic emancipation, specifically funding pro-emancipation members of parliament (MPs) standing for the [[British House of Commons]].<ref>Geoghegan, Patrick M. (2008). ''King Dan''. Gill and Macmillan, Dublin, p. 168</ref>\n\nThe Crown moved to suppress the Association by a series of prosecutions, with mixed success. O'Connell was often briefed for the defence, and showed extraordinary vigour in pleading the rights of Catholics to argue for emancipation. He clashed repeatedly with [[William Saurin]], the [[Attorney General for Ireland]] and most influential figure in the Dublin administration, and political differences between the two men were fuelled by a bitter personal antipathy.<ref>O'Faol\u00e1in pp. 151\u2013179</ref>\n\nIn 1815 a serious event in his life occurred. [[Dublin Corporation]] was considered a stronghold of the [[Protestant Ascendancy]] and O'Connell, in an 1815 speech, referred to it as a \"beggarly corporation\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Millingen|first=John Gideon|title=The history of duelling: including, narratives of the most remarkable personal encounters that have taken place from the earliest period to the present time, Volume 2|year=1841|publisher=R.

The duel had filled [[Dublin Castle]] (from where the [[Dublin Castle administration|British Government administered Ireland]]) with tense excitement at the prospect that O'Connell would be killed. They regarded O'Connell as \"worse than a public nuisance\", and would have welcomed any prospect of seeing him removed at this time.<ref name=\"Dennis Gywnn Pg 138-145\">Dennis Gywnn, ''Daniel O'Connell The Irish Liberator'', Hutchinson & Co. Ltd pp 138\u2013145</ref>\n\nO'Connell met D'Esterre and [[Oughter Ard#Duel|mortally wounded him]] (he was shot in the hip, the bullet then lodging in his stomach), in a duel at [[Oughterard, County Kildare]]. His conscience was bitterly sore by the fact that, not only had he killed a man, but he had left his family almost destitute.<ref>Geoghegan, ''King Dan''  p. 155</ref>\n\nO'Connell offered to \"share his income\" with D'Esterre's widow, but she declined; however, she consented to accept an allowance for her daughter, which O'Connell regularly paid for more than thirty years until his death. The memory of the duel haunted him for the remainder of his life, and he refused ever to fight another, being prepared to risk accusations of cowardice rather than kill again.<ref name=\"Dennis Gywnn Pg 138-145\" />\n\nAs part of his campaign for Catholic emancipation, O'Connell created the Catholic Association in 1823; this organisation acted as a pressure group against the British government so as to achieve emancipation. The [[Catholic Rent]], which was established in 1824 by O'Connell and the Catholic Church raised funds from which O'Connell was able to help finance the Catholic Association in its push for emancipation. Official opinion was gradually swinging towards emancipation, as shown by the summary dismissal of William Saurin, the Attorney General and a leading opponent of religious toleration, whom O'Connell called \"our mortal foe\".\n\nO'Connell stood in a [[1828 Clare by-election|by-election]] to the British House of Commons in 1828 for [[Clare (UK Parliament constituency)|County Clare]] against [[William Vesey-FitzGerald, 2nd Baron FitzGerald and Vesey|William Vesey Fitzgerald]], who had just joined the British Cabinet as President of the Board of Trade. By law at the time, Cabinet office was deemed to be \"an office of profit\" under the Crown, requiring the promoted man to obtain the endorsement of his constituents by standing for re-election.\n\nAfter O'Connell won election, he was unable to take his seat as members of parliament had to take the [[Oath of Supremacy]], which was incompatible with Catholicism. The Prime Minister, the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], and the [[Home Secretary]], Sir [[Robert Peel]], even though they opposed Catholic participation in Parliament, saw that denying O'Connell his seat would cause outrage and could lead to another rebellion or uprising in Ireland, which was about 85% Catholic.<ref>Oliver MacDonagh (1991), ''The Life of Daniel O'Connell''</ref>\n\nPeel and Wellington managed to convince [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]] that Catholic emancipation and the right of Catholics and [[Presbyterian]]s and members of all Christian faiths other than the established [[Church of Ireland]] to sit in Parliament needed to be established; with the help of the [[Whig (British political party)|Whigs]], the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829|Catholic Relief Act]] became law in 1829.\n\nHowever, the Emancipation Act was not made retroactive, meaning that O'Connell had either to seek re-election or to attempt to take the oath of supremacy. When O'Connell attempted on 15 May to take his seat without taking the oath of supremacy,  Solicitor-General [[Nicholas Conyngham Tindal]] moved that his seat be declared vacant and another election ordered; O'Connell was elected unopposed on 30 July 1829.<ref name=\"Hist Parl\">''[[The History of Parliament]] 1820\u20131832'' vol VI pp. 535\u2013536.</ref>\n\nHe took his seat when Parliament resumed in February 1830, by which time [[Henry Charles Howard, 13th Duke of Norfolk]] and Earl of Surrey, had already become the first Roman Catholic to have taken advantage of the Emancipation Act and sit in Parliament.<ref name=\"Not first\">''[[History of Parliament]] 1820\u20131832'' vol I p. 253.</ref><ref name=\"Not first2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.deskeenan.com/1GrChap8.htm|title=The Grail Chapter Eight|work=deskeenan.com}}</ref>\n\n\"Wellington is the King of England\", King George IV once complained, \"O'Connell is King of Ireland, and I am only the dean of Windsor.\" The regal jest expressed the general admiration for O'Connell at the height of his career.\n\nThe Catholic emancipation campaign led by O'Connell served as the precedent and model for the emancipation of [[British Jews]], the subsequent [[Jews Relief Act 1858]] allowing Jewish MPs to omit the words in the [[Oath of Allegiance]] \"and I make this Declaration upon the true Faith of a Christian\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/21-22/49/enacted|title=Jews Relief Act 1858|work=legislation.gov.uk}}</ref> O'Connell himself was an opponent of the persecution of Jews praising Ireland as the \"only Christian country that I know of unsullied by any one act of persecution of the Jews.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://books.google.com/?id=CkULAAAAIAAJ&q=Ireland+has+claims+on+your+ancient+race,+it+is+the+only+country+that+I+know+of+unsullied+by+any+one+act+of+persecution+of+the+Jews%E2%80%9D&dq=Ireland+has+claims+on+your+ancient+race,+it+is+the+only+country+that+I+know+of+unsullied+by+any+one+act+of+persecution+of+the+Jews%E2%80%9D | title=Transactions - the Jewish Historical Society of England| year=1908}}</ref>\n\n===Comments on emancipation===\n[[Michael Doheny]], in his ''The Felon's Track'', says that the very character of emancipation has assumed an \"exaggerated and false guise\" and that it is an error to call it emancipation.

Nonetheless O'Connell rejected [[William Sharman Crawford]]'s call for the complete abolition of tithes in 1838, as he felt he could not embarrass the Whigs (the [[Lichfield House Compact]] secured an alliance between Whigs, radicals and Irish MPs in 1835).<ref name=ste/> In 1838, parliament introduced a {{anchor|Tithe Commutation Act}}Tithe Commutation Act for Ireland.<ref>{{cite book|editor1=Moody, T.

Sir Syed Ahmed Khan established the [[Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College|MAO College]] which eventually became the [[Aligarh Muslim University]]. He opposed ignorance, superstitions and evil customs prevalent in Indian Muslim society. He firmly believed that Muslim society would not progress without the acquisition of western education and science. As time passed, Sir Syed began stressing on the idea of pragmatic modernism and started advocating for strong interfaith relations between [[Islam and Christianity]].\n\n==Causes of the Indian Revolt==\nSir Syed supported the British during the [[1857 uprising]], a role which has been criticised by some nationalists such as [[Jamaluddin Afghani]]. In 1859 Sir Syed published the booklet ''Asbab-e-Baghawat-e-Hind'' (The Causes of the Indian Revolt) in which he studied the causes of the Indian revolt. In this, his most famous work, he rejected the common notion that the conspiracy was planned by Muslim \u00e9lites, who resented the diminishing influence of Muslim monarchs. He blamed the British [[East India Company]] for its aggressive expansion as well as the ignorance of British politicians regarding Indian culture. Sir Syed advised the British to appoint Muslims to assist in administration, to prevent what he called \u2018haramzadgi\u2019 (a vulgar deed) such as the mutiny.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hoodbhoy |first1=Pervez |title=Why Sir Syed loses and Allama Iqbal wins in Pakistan |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/504576/why-sir-syed-loses-and-allama-iqbal-wins-in-pakistan/ |accessdate=30 July 2015 |publisher=The Pakistan Tribune |date=9 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nMaulana Altaf Hussain Hali wrote in the biography of Sir Syed that: <blockquote>\"As soon as Sir Syed reached Muradabad, he began to write the pamphlet entitled 'The Causes of the Indian Revolt' (Asbab-e-Baghawat-e-Hind), in which he did his best to clear the people of India, and especially the Muslims, of the charge of Mutiny. In spite of the obvious danger, he made a courageous and thorough report of the accusations people were making against the Government and refused the theory which the British had invented to explain the causes of the Mutiny.\"<ref name=\"auto\">[[#Hali|Hali]], pp. 92\u201395</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhen the work was finished, without waiting for an English translation, Sir Syed sent the Urdu version to be printed at the Mufassilat Gazette Press in Agra. Within a few weeks, he received 500 copies back from the printers. One of his friends warned him not to send the pamphlet to the British Parliament or to the Government of India. Rae Shankar Das, a great friend of Sir Syed, begged him to burn the books rather than put his life in danger. Sir Syed replied that he was bringing these matters to the attention of the British for the good of his own people, of his country, and of the government itself. He said that if he came to any harm while doing something that would greatly benefit the rulers and the subjects of India alike, he would gladly suffer whatever befell him. When Rae Shankar Das saw that Sir Syed's mind was made up and nothing could be done to change it, he wept and remained silent. After performing a supplementary prayer and asking God's blessing, Sir Syed sent almost all the 500 copies of his pamphlet to England, one to the government, and kept the rest himself.\n\nWhen the government of India had the book translated and presented before the Council, Lord Canning, the governor-general, and [[Sir Bartle Frere]] accepted it as a sincere and friendly report. The foreign secretary [[Cecil Beadon]], however, severely attacked it, calling it 'an extremely seditious pamphlet'. He wanted a proper inquiry into the matter and said that the author, unless he could give a satisfactory explanation, should be harshly dealt with. Since no other member of the Council agreed with his opinion, his attack did no harm.\n\nLater, Sir Syed was invited to attend Lord Canning's [[Durbar (court)|durbar]] in Farrukhabad and happened to meet the foreign secretary there. He told Sir Syed that he was displeased with the pamphlet and added that if he had really had the government's interests at heart, he would not have made his opinion known in this way throughout the country; he would have communicated it directly to the government. Sir Syed replied that he had only had 500 copies printed, the majority of which he had sent to England, one had been given to the government of India, and the remaining copies were still in his possession. Furthermore, he had the receipt to prove it. He was aware, he added, that the view of the rulers had been distorted by the stress and anxieties of the times, which made it difficult to put even the most straightforward problem in its right perspective. It was for this reason that he had not communicated his thoughts publicly. He promised that for every copy that could be found circulating in India he would personally pay 1,000 rupees. At first, Beadon was not convinced and asked Sir Syed over and over again if he was sure that no other copy had been distributed in India. Sir Syed reassured him on this matter, and Beadon never mentioned it again. Later he became one of Sir Syed's strongest supporters.\n\nMany official translations were made of the Urdu text of ''The Causes of the Indian Revolt''. The one undertaken by the India Office formed the subject of many discussions and debates.<ref>[[Masood Ashraf Raja]] (2010) ''Constructing Pakistan: Foundational Texts and the Rise of Muslim National Identity'', 1857\u20131947. Oxford.  Chapter 2. {{ISBN|978-0-19-547811-2}}</ref> The pamphlet was also translated by the government of India and several members of parliament, but no version was offered to the public. A translation which had been started by a government official was finished by Sir Syed's great friend, Colonel G.F.I. Graham, and finally published in 1873.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Influence of Mirza Ghalib==\n[[File:Court of Akbar from Akbarnama.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The court of Akbar, an illustration from a manuscript of the [[Ain-e-Akbari]]]]\nIn 1855, <nowiki>he finished</nowiki> his scholarly, well researched and illustrated edition of Abul Fazl's ''[[Ain-e-Akbari|Ai'n-e Akbari]]'', itself an extraordinarily difficult book. Having finished the work to his satisfaction, and believing that [[Mirza Ghalib|Mirza Asadullah Khan Ghalib]] was a person who would appreciate his labours, Syed Ahmad approached the great Ghalib to write a ''taqriz'' (in the convention of the times, a laudatory foreword) for it. Ghalib obliged, but what he did produce was a short Persian poem castigating the Ai'n-e Akbari, and by implication, the imperial, sumptuous, literate and learned Mughal culture of which it was a product. The least that could be said against it was that the book had little value even as an antique document. Ghalib practically reprimanded Syed Ahmad Khan for wasting his talents and time on dead things. Worse, he praised sky-high the \"sahibs of England\" who at that time held all the keys to all the a\u2019ins in this world.<ref>The word a\u2019in can mean all or any of the following: character, convention, temperament, habit, rule, path, law (ecclesiastical or secular), creed, praxis, quality, intention, organization, management, system, decoration, beauty. (Lughat Nama-e Dehkhoda). There are about eighty meanings in all. These meanings seem to have developed over the centuries. Most were available to Abul Fazl; all were available to Ghalib.</ref>\n\nThe poem was unexpected, but it came at the time when Syed Ahmad Khan's thought and feelings themselves were inclining toward change. Ghalib seemed to be acutely aware of a European[English]-sponsored change in world polity, especially Indian polity. Syed Ahmad might well have been piqued at Ghalib's admonitions, but he would also have realized that Ghalib's reading of the situation, though not nuanced enough, was basically accurate. Syed Ahmad Khan may also have felt that he, being better informed about the English and the outside world, should have himself seen the change that now seemed to be just round the corner.\n\nSir Syed Ahmad Khan never again wrote a word in praise of the ''Ai'n-e Akbari'' and in fact gave up taking an active interest in history and archaeology. He did edit another two historical texts over the next few years, but neither of them was anything like the ''Ai'n'': a vast and triumphalist document on the governance of Akbar.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Faruqi |first1=Shamsur Rahman |title=From Antiquary to Social Revolutionary: Syed Ahmad Khan and the Colonial Experience |url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00fwp/srf/srf_sirsayyid.pdf |website=Shamsur Rahman Faruqi, work in English |publisher=Columbia University |accessdate=12 December 2015 |ref=srf_ss_gh}}</ref>\n\n==Scholarly works==\n[[File:Muhammadansocialreformer.jpg|thumb|right|upright|First issue of the journal ''Muhammadan Social Reformer'' dated 24 December 1870, it was a pioneering publication initiated by Sir Syed to promote liberal ideas in Muslim society.]]\n\nWhile continuing to work as a junior clerk, Sir Syed began focusing on writing, from the age of 23 (in 1840), on various subjects (from [[mechanics]] to educational issues), mainly in Urdu, where he wrote, at least, 6000 pages.<ref>John W.

In 1842, he completed the ''Jila-ul-Qulub bi Zikr-il Mahbub'' and the ''Tuhfa-i-Hasan'', along with the ''Tahsil fi jar-i-Saqil'' in 1844. These works focused on religious and cultural subjects. In 1852, he published the two works ''Namiqa dar bayan masala tasawwur-i-Shaikh'' and ''Silsilat ul-Mulk''.

Ltd. |page=59 |year=2000 |isbn=978-81-261-0431-4}}</ref> Sir Syed began feeling increasingly concerned for the future of Muslim communities.<ref name=\"EPMI\" /> A scion of Mughal nobility, Sir Syed had been reared in the finest traditions of Muslim \u00e9lite culture and was aware of the steady decline of Muslim political power across India. The animosity between the British and Muslims before and after the rebellion (Independence War) of 1857 threatened to marginalise Muslim communities across India for many generations.<ref name=\"EPMI\" /> Sir Syed intensified his work to promote co-operation with British authorities, promoting loyalty to the [[British Empire|Empire]] amongst Indian Muslims. Committed to working for the upliftment of Muslims, Sir Syed founded a modern [[madrassa]] in Muradabad in 1859; this was one of the first religious schools to impart scientific education. Sir Syed also worked on social causes, helping to organise relief for the famine-struck people of North-West Province in 1860. He established another modern school in [[Ghazipur]] in 1863.\n\nUpon his transfer to [[Aligarh]] in 1864, Sir Syed began working wholeheartedly as an educator. He founded the [[Scientific Society of Aligarh]], the first scientific association of its kind in India. Modelling it after the [[Royal Society]] and the [[Royal Asiatic Society]],<ref name=\"Bio\" /> Sir Syed assembled Muslim scholars from different parts of the country. The Society held annual conferences, disbursed funds for educational causes and regularly published a journal on scientific subjects in [[English language|English]] and Urdu. Sir Syed felt that the socio-economic future of Muslims was threatened by their orthodox aversions to modern science and technology.<ref name=\"EPMI\" /> He published many writings promoting liberal, rational interpretations of [[Islamic Holy Books|Islamic scriptures]]. \nOne example was the reaction to his argument \u2013 which appeared in his ''[[tafsir]]'' (exegesis) of the [[Quran]] \u2013 that ''[[riba]]'' referred to interest charges when lending money to the poor, but not to the rich, nor to borrowers \"in trade or in industry\", since this finance supported \"trade, national welfare and prosperity\". While many jurists declared all interest to be riba, (according to Sir Syed) this was based \"on their own authority and deduction\" rather than the Quran.<ref>''Tafsir al Quran'', v.1 p.3016, translated and quoted in [[#Baljon|Baljon]], pp. 44\u201345</ref>\n\nMany other orthodox Sunni schools condemned him as out of the fold of Islam i.e. ''[[kafir]]''.<ref name = \"Islam\"/> Many of his own friends, like Nawab [[Mohsin-ul-Mulk|Muhsin ul Mulk]], expressed their significant reservations at his religious ideas (many of which were expounded in his commentary of Qur'an).<ref>[[#Panipati|Panipati]], pp. 249\u2013263</ref> According to J.M.S. Baljon his ideas created \"a real hurricane of protests and outbursts of wrath\" among the local clerics \"in every town and village\" in Muslim India, who issued [[fatwa|fatawa]] \"declaring him to be a ''[[kafir]]''\" (unbeliever).<ref name=\"baljon-108\">[[#Baljon|Baljon]], p. 108</ref> He was also accused of having converted to Christianity.<ref name=\"baljon-106\">[[#Baljon|Baljon]], p. 106</ref>\n\nMaulana [[Muhammad Qasim Nanotvi|Qasim Nanautawi]], the founder of [[Darul Uloom Deoband|Darul 'Uloom Deoband]], expressed in a letter to an anacquaintance of his and Sir Syed's:\n\n\"No doubt, I greatly admire, as per what I've heard, Syed (Ahmad) Sahab's courage (''\u016alul Azmi'') and concern for the Muslims (''Dardmandi e Ahl e Islam''). For this if I shall express my affection for him, it will be rightful. However, similar to this (or rather more than this), upon hearing about his disturbed (F\u0101sid) beliefs, I have deep complains and sorrow for him\"<ref>[[#Panipati|Panipati]], p. 102</ref> \n\nMaulana Qasim Nanautawi wrote directly to Sir Syed as well, explaining him some of his \"noteworthy\" mistakes. This correspondence was published as \"Tasfiyat ul Aqaaid\" in 1887 C.E<ref>[[#Panipati|Panipati]], p. 100</ref>\n==Advocacy of Urdu==\n{{See also|Hindi-Urdu controversy}}\n[[File:Sirsyedinpunjab.jpg|thumb|right|Sir Syed Ahmed Khan in Punjab]]\n\nThe onset of the [[Hindi-Urdu controversy]] of 1867 saw the emergence of Sir Syed as a champion for cause of the Urdu language. He became a leading Muslim voice opposing the adoption of [[Hindi]] as a second official language of the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]] (now [[Uttar Pradesh]]). Sir Syed perceived Urdu as the ''lingua franca'' of the United Provinces. Having been developed by during the Mughal period, Urdu was used as a secondary language to Persian, the official language of the Mughal court. Since the decline of the Mughal dynasty, Sir Syed promoted the use of Urdu through his own writings. Under Sir Syed, the Scientific Society translated Western works only into Urdu. The schools established by Sir Syed imparted education in the Urdu medium. The demand for Hindi, led largely by Hindus, was to Sir Syed an erosion of the centuries-old Muslim cultural domination of India. Testifying before the British-appointed education commission, Sir Syed controversially exclaimed that \"Urdu was the language of [[gentry]] and Hindi that of the vulgar.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=fmnpssOM_3kC&pg=PA41&lpg=PA41&dq=Urdu+was+the+language+of+gentry+and+Hindi+that+of+the+vulgar&source=bl&ots=qYJzARaHiI&sig=sUvDhRokxc7PfrU6dm4TdZpX1bw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=varoUYTLNKbG0AX1uIGwDA&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Urdu%20was%20the%20language%20of%20gentry%20and%20Hindi%20that%20of%20the%20vulgar&f=false Hindi Nationalism], Alok Rai, Orient Blackswan, 2001</ref> His remarks provoked a hostile response from Hindu leaders, who unified across the nation to demand the recognition of Hindi.\n\nThe success of the Hindi movement led Sir Syed to further advocate Urdu as the symbol of Muslim heritage and as the language of all Indian Muslims. His educational and political work grew increasingly centred around and exclusively for Muslim interests. He also sought to persuade the British to give Urdu extensive official use and patronage. His colleagues such as [[Mohsin-ul-Mulk]] and [[Maulvi Abdul Haq]] developed organisations such as the [[Urdu Defence Association]] and the [[Anjuman Taraqqi-i-Urdu]], committed to the perpetuation of Urdu.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} All these colleagues led efforts that resulted in the adoption of Urdu as the official language of the [[Hyderabad State]] and as the medium of instruction in the [[Osmania University]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}<ref name=\"Yusuf\">{{cite book |title=Muslim Politics and Leadership in the South Asian Sub-continent |publisher=Institute of Islamic History, Culture and Civilization, Islamic University ([[Islamabad]]) |first=Yusuf |last=ABBASI |page=90 |year=1981}}</ref> To Muslims in northern and western India, Urdu had become an integral part of political and cultural identity. However, the division over the use of Hindi or Urdu further provoked communal conflict between Muslims and Hindus in India.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nOn 1 April 1869 he went, along with his son [[Syed Mahmood]], to [[England]], where he was awarded the [[Order of the Star of India]] from the British government on 6 August. Travelling across England, he visited its colleges and was inspired by the culture of learning established after the [[Renaissance]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Sir Syed returned to India in the following year determined to build a \"Muslim [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]].\" Upon his return, he organised the \"Committee for the Better Diffusion and Advancement of Learning among [[Muslim|Muhammadans]]\" (Muslims) on 26 December 1870. Sir Syed described his vision of the institution he proposed to establish in an article written sometime in 1872 and re-printed in the [[Aligarh Institute Gazette]] of 5 April 1911:\n\n<blockquote>I may appear to be dreaming and talking like Shaikh Chilli, but we aim to turn this MAO College into a University similar to that of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] or Cambridge. Like the churches of Oxford and Cambridge, there will be [[mosque]]s attached to each College... The College will have a dispensary with a Doctor and a compounder, besides a ''[[Unani]] [[Hakim (title)|Hakim]]''. It will be mandatory on boys in residence to join the congregational prayers ([[salat|namaz]]) at all the five times. Students of other religions will be exempted from this religious observance. Muslim students will have a uniform consisting of a black alpaca, half-sleeved ''chugha'' and a red ''[[Fez (clothing)|Fez]]'' cap... Bad and abusive words which boys generally pick up and get used to, will be strictly prohibited. Even such a word as a \"liar\" will be treated as an abuse to be prohibited. They will have food either on tables of [[table manners|European style]] or on chaukis in the manner of the [[Arab cuisine#Culture|Arabs]]... Smoking of cigarette or ''[[hookah|huqqa]]'' and the chewing of [[betel]]s shall be strictly prohibited. No [[corporal punishment]] or any such punishment as is likely to injure a student's self-respect will be permissible... It will be strictly enforced that [[Shia Islam|Shia]] and [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] boys shall not discuss their religious differences in the College or in the boarding house. At present it is like a day dream. I pray to God that this dream may come true.\"{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Sirsyedsignatures.jpg|thumb|right|Signatures of Sir Syed]]\n\nBy 1873, the committee under Sir Syed issued proposals for the construction of a college in Aligarh. He began publishing the journal ''Tahzib-al-Akhlaq'' (''Social Reformer'') on 24 December 1870 to spread awareness and knowledge on modern subjects and promote reforms in Muslim society.<ref>[http://aligarhmovement.com/Chronology_of_Aligarh_Movement A Brief Chronology of Aligarh Movement]. aligarhmovement.com </ref> Sir Syed worked to promote reinterpretation of Muslim ideology in order to reconcile tradition with Western education. He argued in several books on Islam that the Qur'an rested on an appreciation of reason and natural law, making scientific inquiry important to being a good Muslim. Sir Syed established a modern school in Aligarh and, obtaining support from wealthy Muslims and the British, laid the foundation stone of the [[Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College]] on 24 May 1875. He retired from his career as a jurist the following year, concentrating entirely on developing the college and on religious reform.<ref name=\"Bio\" /> Sir Syed's pioneering work received support from the British. Although intensely criticised by orthodox religious leaders hostile to modern influences, Sir Syed's new institution attracted a large student body, mainly drawn from the Muslim gentry and middle classes.<ref name = \"Islam\">{{cite book |title=Islam in Global History |author=Nazeer Ahmed |publisher=Xlibris Corporation |page=231 |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-7388-5966-8}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=December 2017}} The curriculum at the college involved scientific and Western subjects, as well as Oriental subjects and religious education.<ref name=\"Bio\" /> The first [[chancellor (education)|chancellor]] was [[Sultan Shah Jahan, Begum of Bhopal|Sultan Shah Jahan Begum]], a prominent Muslim noblewoman, and Sir Syed invited an Englishman, [[Theodore Beck]], to serve as the first college principal.<ref name=\"Islam\" /> The college was originally affiliated with [[Calcutta University]] but was transferred to the [[Allahabad University]] in 1885. Near the turn of the 20th century, it began publishing its own magazine and established a law school. In 1920, the college was transformed into a university.\n\n==Political career==\nIn 1878, Sir Syed was nominated to the Viceroy's Legislative Council.<ref name=\"LW 289\">[[#Graham|Graham]], p. 289</ref> He testified before the education commission to promote the establishment of more colleges and schools across India. In the same year, Sir Syed founded the Muhammadan Association to promote political co-operation amongst Indian Muslims from different parts of the country. In 1886, he organised the [[All India Muhammadan Educational Conference]] in Aligarh, which promoted his vision of modern education and political unity for Muslims. His works made him the most prominent Muslim politician in 19th century India, often influencing the attitude of Muslims on various national issues. He supported the efforts of Indian political leaders [[Surendranath Banerjee]] and [[Dadabhai Naoroji]] to obtain representation for Indians in the government and civil services. In 1883, he founded the Muhammadan Civil Service Fund Association to encourage and support the entry of Muslim graduates into the [[Indian Civil Service]] (ICS).<ref name=\"Bio\" /><ref name=\"RC\">{{cite book |title=Struggle for Freedom |publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan |page=1967 |author=RC Majumdar|id=ASIN: B000HXEOUM |year=1969}}</ref> While fearful of the loss of Muslim political power owing to the community's backwardness, Sir Syed was also averse to the prospect of democratic self-government, which would give control of government to the Hindu-majority population:<ref name=\"Baig\">{{cite book |title=The Muslim Dilemma in India |isbn=9780706903119|publisher=Vikas Publishing House |location=[[Delhi]] |author=M.R.A.

Ahmad Khan founded the All India Muhammadan Educational Conference in 1886 in order to promote Western education, especially science and literature, among India's Muslims. The conference, in addition to generating funds for Ahmad Khan's Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College, motivated Muslim elites to propose expansion of educational uplift elsewhere, known as the [[Aligarh Movement]]. In turn this new awareness of Muslim needs helped stimulate a political consciousness among Muslim elites that went on to form the AIML.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Abdul Rashid Khan|title=All India Muhammadan Educational Conference and the Foundation of the All India Muslim League|journal=Journal of the Pakistan Historical Society|year=2007|volume=55 |issue =1\u20132|pages=65\u201383}}</ref>\n\nOverall, Syed Ahmed is hailed as a Muslim social reformer who promoted communal harmony and peaceful coexistence of all communities in India. In an undivided India under the British rule, he was worried about Muslim backwardness and unwillingness to adopt modern education. He worked towards social and educational upliftment of Muslims so as to enable them to walk shoulder to shoulder with all other communities in India.\n\n==Final years and legacy==\n\nSyed Ahmad is widely commemorated across South Asia as a great Muslim social reformer and visionary.<ref name=\"Bio\" /><ref name=\"RC\" /> At the same time, Syed Ahmad sought to politically ally Muslims with the British government. An avowed loyalist of the [[British Empire]], he was nominated as a member of the Civil Service Commission in 1887 by [[Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava|Lord Dufferin]]. In 1888, he established the [[United Patriotic Association]] at Aligarh to promote political co-operation with the British and Muslim participation in the British government.\n\nSir Syed Ahmed Khan Bahadur lived the last two decades of his life in Aligarh, regarded widely as the mentor of 19th and 20th century Muslim entrepreneurs. Battling illnesses and old age, Sir Syed died on 27 March 1898. He was buried besides [[Sir Syed Masjid]] inside the campus of the [[Aligarh Muslim University]].\n\nThe university he founded remains one of India's most prominent institutions. Prominent alumni of Aligarh include Muslim political leaders Maulana [[Mohammad Ali Jouhar]], [[Abdur Rab Nishtar]], [[Maulana Shaukat Ali]] and [[Maulvi Abdul Haq]], who is hailed in [[Pakistan]] as ''[[Baba-e-Urdu]]'' (''Father of Urdu''). The first two [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Ministers of Pakistan]], [[Liaquat Ali Khan]] and [[Khawaja Nazimuddin]], as well as [[Indian President]] [[Zakir Hussain (politician)|Dr. Zakir Hussain]], are amongst Aligarh's most famous graduates. In India, Sir Syed is commemorated as a pioneer who worked for the socio-political upliftment of Indian Muslims.\n\n== Honors ==\nSyed Ahmad Khan was appointed the fellow of the Calcutta University and Allahabad University by the Viceroy in the year 1876 and 1887 respectively.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kmYjnGDHPFwC |title=Cementing Ethics with Modernism: An Appraisal of Sir Sayyed Ahmed Khan's Writings |date=1 January 2010 |publisher=Gyan Publishing House |isbn=9788121210478 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nSyed Ahmed was bestowed with the suffix of 'Khan Bahadur' and was subsequently [[knight]]ed by the British government in 1888 and was awarded [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India|Knight Commander of the order of Star of India]] (KCSI)<ref name=brit>{{cite book |last1=Ikram |first1=S.S. |title=Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan: Muslim Scholar |publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Sayyid-Ahmad-Khan |accessdate=30 July 2015}}</ref> for his loyalty to the British crown, through his membership of the Imperial Legislative Council<ref>{{cite web |author=Puja Mondal |title=Sir Syed Ahmed Khan and the Aligarh Movement |url=http://www.yourarticlelibrary.com/history/sir-syed-ahmed-khan-and-the-aligarh-movement/23145/ |accessdate=30 July 2015|date=4 January 2014 }}</ref> and in the following year he received an [[Doctor of Laws|LL.D.]] ''honoris causa'' from the [[Edinburgh University]].<ref name=\"Bio\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/a-musafir-to-london/278673 |title=A Musafir To London|author=C.M.

At the outbreak of the [[Indian rebellion of 1857|Indian rebellion]], on 10 May 1857, Sir Syed was serving as the chief assessment officer at the court in [[Bijnor]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Northern India became the scene of the most intense fighting.<ref name=\"SSU\">{{cite web|title=Sir Syed Ahmad Khan \u2013 Chronology |publisher=Sir Syed University of Engineering and Technology|url=https://ssuet.edu.pk/about-us/inspiration/sir-syed-ahmed-khan/ |date=21 August 2016}}</ref> The conflict had left large numbers of civilians dead.

Although he succeeded in rescuing his mother from the turmoil, she died in [[Meerut]], owing to the privations she had experienced.<ref name=\"SSU\" />\n\nSocial reforms in the Muslim society were initiated by [[Nawab Abdul Latif|Abdul Latif]] who founded \"The Mohammedan Literary Society\" in Bengal. Sir Syed Ahmed Khan established the [[Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College|MAO College]] which eventually became the [[Aligarh Muslim University]]. He opposed ignorance, superstitions and evil customs prevalent in Indian Muslim society. He firmly believed that Muslim society would not progress without the acquisition of western education and science. As time passed, Sir Syed began stressing on the idea of pragmatic modernism and started advocating for strong interfaith relations between [[Islam and Christianity]].\n\n==Causes of the Indian Revolt==\nSir Syed supported the British during the [[1857 uprising]], a role which has been criticised by some nationalists such as [[Jamaluddin Afghani]]. In 1859 Sir Syed published the booklet ''Asbab-e-Baghawat-e-Hind'' (The Causes of the Indian Revolt) in which he studied the causes of the Indian revolt. In this, his most famous work, he rejected the common notion that the conspiracy was planned by Muslim \u00e9lites, who resented the diminishing influence of Muslim monarchs. He blamed the British [[East India Company]] for its aggressive expansion as well as the ignorance of British politicians regarding Indian culture. Sir Syed advised the British to appoint Muslims to assist in administration, to prevent what he called \u2018haramzadgi\u2019 (a vulgar deed) such as the mutiny.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hoodbhoy |first1=Pervez |title=Why Sir Syed loses and Allama Iqbal wins in Pakistan |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/504576/why-sir-syed-loses-and-allama-iqbal-wins-in-pakistan/ |accessdate=30 July 2015 |publisher=The Pakistan Tribune |date=9 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nMaulana Altaf Hussain Hali wrote in the biography of Sir Syed that: <blockquote>\"As soon as Sir Syed reached Muradabad, he began to write the pamphlet entitled 'The Causes of the Indian Revolt' (Asbab-e-Baghawat-e-Hind), in which he did his best to clear the people of India, and especially the Muslims, of the charge of Mutiny. In spite of the obvious danger, he made a courageous and thorough report of the accusations people were making against the Government and refused the theory which the British had invented to explain the causes of the Mutiny.\"<ref name=\"auto\">[[#Hali|Hali]], pp. 92\u201395</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhen the work was finished, without waiting for an English translation, Sir Syed sent the Urdu version to be printed at the Mufassilat Gazette Press in Agra. Within a few weeks, he received 500 copies back from the printers. One of his friends warned him not to send the pamphlet to the British Parliament or to the Government of India. Rae Shankar Das, a great friend of Sir Syed, begged him to burn the books rather than put his life in danger. Sir Syed replied that he was bringing these matters to the attention of the British for the good of his own people, of his country, and of the government itself. He said that if he came to any harm while doing something that would greatly benefit the rulers and the subjects of India alike, he would gladly suffer whatever befell him. When Rae Shankar Das saw that Sir Syed's mind was made up and nothing could be done to change it, he wept and remained silent. After performing a supplementary prayer and asking God's blessing, Sir Syed sent almost all the 500 copies of his pamphlet to England, one to the government, and kept the rest himself.\n\nWhen the government of India had the book translated and presented before the Council, Lord Canning, the governor-general, and [[Sir Bartle Frere]] accepted it as a sincere and friendly report. The foreign secretary [[Cecil Beadon]], however, severely attacked it, calling it 'an extremely seditious pamphlet'. He wanted a proper inquiry into the matter and said that the author, unless he could give a satisfactory explanation, should be harshly dealt with. Since no other member of the Council agreed with his opinion, his attack did no harm.\n\nLater, Sir Syed was invited to attend Lord Canning's [[Durbar (court)|durbar]] in Farrukhabad and happened to meet the foreign secretary there. He told Sir Syed that he was displeased with the pamphlet and added that if he had really had the government's interests at heart, he would not have made his opinion known in this way throughout the country; he would have communicated it directly to the government. Sir Syed replied that he had only had 500 copies printed, the majority of which he had sent to England, one had been given to the government of India, and the remaining copies were still in his possession. Furthermore, he had the receipt to prove it. He was aware, he added, that the view of the rulers had been distorted by the stress and anxieties of the times, which made it difficult to put even the most straightforward problem in its right perspective. It was for this reason that he had not communicated his thoughts publicly. He promised that for every copy that could be found circulating in India he would personally pay 1,000 rupees. At first, Beadon was not convinced and asked Sir Syed over and over again if he was sure that no other copy had been distributed in India. Sir Syed reassured him on this matter, and Beadon never mentioned it again. Later he became one of Sir Syed's strongest supporters.\n\nMany official translations were made of the Urdu text of ''The Causes of the Indian Revolt''. The one undertaken by the India Office formed the subject of many discussions and debates.<ref>[[Masood Ashraf Raja]] (2010) ''Constructing Pakistan: Foundational Texts and the Rise of Muslim National Identity'', 1857\u20131947.

Having finished the work to his satisfaction, and believing that [[Mirza Ghalib|Mirza Asadullah Khan Ghalib]] was a person who would appreciate his labours, Syed Ahmad approached the great Ghalib to write a ''taqriz'' (in the convention of the times, a laudatory foreword) for it. Ghalib obliged, but what he did produce was a short Persian poem castigating the Ai'n-e Akbari, and by implication, the imperial, sumptuous, literate and learned Mughal culture of which it was a product. The least that could be said against it was that the book had little value even as an antique document. Ghalib practically reprimanded Syed Ahmad Khan for wasting his talents and time on dead things. Worse, he praised sky-high the \"sahibs of England\" who at that time held all the keys to all the a\u2019ins in this world.<ref>The word a\u2019in can mean all or any of the following: character, convention, temperament, habit, rule, path, law (ecclesiastical or secular), creed, praxis, quality, intention, organization, management, system, decoration, beauty. (Lughat Nama-e Dehkhoda). There are about eighty meanings in all. These meanings seem to have developed over the centuries. Most were available to Abul Fazl; all were available to Ghalib.</ref>\n\nThe poem was unexpected, but it came at the time when Syed Ahmad Khan's thought and feelings themselves were inclining toward change. Ghalib seemed to be acutely aware of a European[English]-sponsored change in world polity, especially Indian polity. Syed Ahmad might well have been piqued at Ghalib's admonitions, but he would also have realized that Ghalib's reading of the situation, though not nuanced enough, was basically accurate. Syed Ahmad Khan may also have felt that he, being better informed about the English and the outside world, should have himself seen the change that now seemed to be just round the corner.\n\nSir Syed Ahmad Khan never again wrote a word in praise of the ''Ai'n-e Akbari'' and in fact gave up taking an active interest in history and archaeology. He did edit another two historical texts over the next few years, but neither of them was anything like the ''Ai'n'': a vast and triumphalist document on the governance of Akbar.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Faruqi |first1=Shamsur Rahman |title=From Antiquary to Social Revolutionary: Syed Ahmad Khan and the Colonial Experience |url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00fwp/srf/srf_sirsayyid.pdf |website=Shamsur Rahman Faruqi, work in English |publisher=Columbia University |accessdate=12 December 2015 |ref=srf_ss_gh}}</ref>\n\n==Scholarly works==\n[[File:Muhammadansocialreformer.jpg|thumb|right|upright|First issue of the journal ''Muhammadan Social Reformer'' dated 24 December 1870, it was a pioneering publication initiated by Sir Syed to promote liberal ideas in Muslim society.]]\n\nWhile continuing to work as a junior clerk, Sir Syed began focusing on writing, from the age of 23 (in 1840), on various subjects (from [[mechanics]] to educational issues), mainly in Urdu, where he wrote, at least, 6000 pages.<ref>John W.

While pursuing studies of different subjects including European jurisprudence, Sir Syed began to realise the advantages of Western-style education, which was being offered at newly established colleges across India. Despite being a devout Muslim, Sir Syed criticised the influence of traditional dogma and religious orthodoxy, which had made most Indian Muslims suspicious of British influences.<ref name=\"EPMI\">{{cite book |title=Educational Philosophy in Modern India |first=S |last=KUMAR |publisher=Anmol Publications Pvt. Ltd. |page=59 |year=2000 |isbn=978-81-261-0431-4}}</ref> Sir Syed began feeling increasingly concerned for the future of Muslim communities.<ref name=\"EPMI\" /> A scion of Mughal nobility, Sir Syed had been reared in the finest traditions of Muslim \u00e9lite culture and was aware of the steady decline of Muslim political power across India. The animosity between the British and Muslims before and after the rebellion (Independence War) of 1857 threatened to marginalise Muslim communities across India for many generations.<ref name=\"EPMI\" /> Sir Syed intensified his work to promote co-operation with British authorities, promoting loyalty to the [[British Empire|Empire]] amongst Indian Muslims. Committed to working for the upliftment of Muslims, Sir Syed founded a modern [[madrassa]] in Muradabad in 1859; this was one of the first religious schools to impart scientific education. Sir Syed also worked on social causes, helping to organise relief for the famine-struck people of North-West Province in 1860. He established another modern school in [[Ghazipur]] in 1863.\n\nUpon his transfer to [[Aligarh]] in 1864, Sir Syed began working wholeheartedly as an educator. He founded the [[Scientific Society of Aligarh]], the first scientific association of its kind in India. Modelling it after the [[Royal Society]] and the [[Royal Asiatic Society]],<ref name=\"Bio\" /> Sir Syed assembled Muslim scholars from different parts of the country. The Society held annual conferences, disbursed funds for educational causes and regularly published a journal on scientific subjects in [[English language|English]] and Urdu. Sir Syed felt that the socio-economic future of Muslims was threatened by their orthodox aversions to modern science and technology.<ref name=\"EPMI\" /> He published many writings promoting liberal, rational interpretations of [[Islamic Holy Books|Islamic scriptures]]. \nOne example was the reaction to his argument \u2013 which appeared in his ''[[tafsir]]'' (exegesis) of the [[Quran]] \u2013 that ''[[riba]]'' referred to interest charges when lending money to the poor, but not to the rich, nor to borrowers \"in trade or in industry\", since this finance supported \"trade, national welfare and prosperity\". While many jurists declared all interest to be riba, (according to Sir Syed) this was based \"on their own authority and deduction\" rather than the Quran.<ref>''Tafsir al Quran'', v.1 p.3016, translated and quoted in [[#Baljon|Baljon]], pp. 44\u201345</ref>\n\nMany other orthodox Sunni schools condemned him as out of the fold of Islam i.e. ''[[kafir]]''.<ref name = \"Islam\"/> Many of his own friends, like Nawab [[Mohsin-ul-Mulk|Muhsin ul Mulk]], expressed their significant reservations at his religious ideas (many of which were expounded in his commentary of Qur'an).<ref>[[#Panipati|Panipati]], pp. 249\u2013263</ref> According to J.M.S. Baljon his ideas created \"a real hurricane of protests and outbursts of wrath\" among the local clerics \"in every town and village\" in Muslim India, who issued [[fatwa|fatawa]] \"declaring him to be a ''[[kafir]]''\" (unbeliever).<ref name=\"baljon-108\">[[#Baljon|Baljon]], p. 108</ref> He was also accused of having converted to Christianity.<ref name=\"baljon-106\">[[#Baljon|Baljon]], p. 106</ref>\n\nMaulana [[Muhammad Qasim Nanotvi|Qasim Nanautawi]], the founder of [[Darul Uloom Deoband|Darul 'Uloom Deoband]], expressed in a letter to an anacquaintance of his and Sir Syed's:\n\n\"No doubt, I greatly admire, as per what I've heard, Syed (Ahmad) Sahab's courage (''\u016alul Azmi'') and concern for the Muslims (''Dardmandi e Ahl e Islam''). For this if I shall express my affection for him, it will be rightful. However, similar to this (or rather more than this), upon hearing about his disturbed (F\u0101sid) beliefs, I have deep complains and sorrow for him\"<ref>[[#Panipati|Panipati]], p. 102</ref> \n\nMaulana Qasim Nanautawi wrote directly to Sir Syed as well, explaining him some of his \"noteworthy\" mistakes. This correspondence was published as \"Tasfiyat ul Aqaaid\" in 1887 C.E<ref>[[#Panipati|Panipati]], p. 100</ref>\n==Advocacy of Urdu==\n{{See also|Hindi-Urdu controversy}}\n[[File:Sirsyedinpunjab.jpg|thumb|right|Sir Syed Ahmed Khan in Punjab]]\n\nThe onset of the [[Hindi-Urdu controversy]] of 1867 saw the emergence of Sir Syed as a champion for cause of the Urdu language. He became a leading Muslim voice opposing the adoption of [[Hindi]] as a second official language of the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]] (now [[Uttar Pradesh]]). Sir Syed perceived Urdu as the ''lingua franca'' of the United Provinces. Having been developed by during the Mughal period, Urdu was used as a secondary language to Persian, the official language of the Mughal court. Since the decline of the Mughal dynasty, Sir Syed promoted the use of Urdu through his own writings. Under Sir Syed, the Scientific Society translated Western works only into Urdu. The schools established by Sir Syed imparted education in the Urdu medium. The demand for Hindi, led largely by Hindus, was to Sir Syed an erosion of the centuries-old Muslim cultural domination of India. Testifying before the British-appointed education commission, Sir Syed controversially exclaimed that \"Urdu was the language of [[gentry]] and Hindi that of the vulgar.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=fmnpssOM_3kC&pg=PA41&lpg=PA41&dq=Urdu+was+the+language+of+gentry+and+Hindi+that+of+the+vulgar&source=bl&ots=qYJzARaHiI&sig=sUvDhRokxc7PfrU6dm4TdZpX1bw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=varoUYTLNKbG0AX1uIGwDA&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Urdu%20was%20the%20language%20of%20gentry%20and%20Hindi%20that%20of%20the%20vulgar&f=false Hindi Nationalism], Alok Rai, Orient Blackswan, 2001</ref> His remarks provoked a hostile response from Hindu leaders, who unified across the nation to demand the recognition of Hindi.\n\nThe success of the Hindi movement led Sir Syed to further advocate Urdu as the symbol of Muslim heritage and as the language of all Indian Muslims. His educational and political work grew increasingly centred around and exclusively for Muslim interests. He also sought to persuade the British to give Urdu extensive official use and patronage. His colleagues such as [[Mohsin-ul-Mulk]] and [[Maulvi Abdul Haq]] developed organisations such as the [[Urdu Defence Association]] and the [[Anjuman Taraqqi-i-Urdu]], committed to the perpetuation of Urdu.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} All these colleagues led efforts that resulted in the adoption of Urdu as the official language of the [[Hyderabad State]] and as the medium of instruction in the [[Osmania University]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}<ref name=\"Yusuf\">{{cite book |title=Muslim Politics and Leadership in the South Asian Sub-continent |publisher=Institute of Islamic History, Culture and Civilization, Islamic University ([[Islamabad]]) |first=Yusuf |last=ABBASI |page=90 |year=1981}}</ref> To Muslims in northern and western India, Urdu had become an integral part of political and cultural identity. However, the division over the use of Hindi or Urdu further provoked communal conflict between Muslims and Hindus in India.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nOn 1 April 1869 he went, along with his son [[Syed Mahmood]], to [[England]], where he was awarded the [[Order of the Star of India]] from the British government on 6 August. Travelling across England, he visited its colleges and was inspired by the culture of learning established after the [[Renaissance]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Sir Syed returned to India in the following year determined to build a \"Muslim [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]].\" Upon his return, he organised the \"Committee for the Better Diffusion and Advancement of Learning among [[Muslim|Muhammadans]]\" (Muslims) on 26 December 1870. Sir Syed described his vision of the institution he proposed to establish in an article written sometime in 1872 and re-printed in the [[Aligarh Institute Gazette]] of 5 April 1911:\n\n<blockquote>I may appear to be dreaming and talking like Shaikh Chilli, but we aim to turn this MAO College into a University similar to that of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] or Cambridge. Like the churches of Oxford and Cambridge, there will be [[mosque]]s attached to each College... The College will have a dispensary with a Doctor and a compounder, besides a ''[[Unani]] [[Hakim (title)|Hakim]]''. It will be mandatory on boys in residence to join the congregational prayers ([[salat|namaz]]) at all the five times. Students of other religions will be exempted from this religious observance. Muslim students will have a uniform consisting of a black alpaca, half-sleeved ''chugha'' and a red ''[[Fez (clothing)|Fez]]'' cap... Bad and abusive words which boys generally pick up and get used to, will be strictly prohibited. Even such a word as a \"liar\" will be treated as an abuse to be prohibited.

Smoking of cigarette or ''[[hookah|huqqa]]'' and the chewing of [[betel]]s shall be strictly prohibited. No [[corporal punishment]] or any such punishment as is likely to injure a student's self-respect will be permissible... It will be strictly enforced that [[Shia Islam|Shia]] and [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] boys shall not discuss their religious differences in the College or in the boarding house. At present it is like a day dream. I pray to God that this dream may come true.\"{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Sirsyedsignatures.jpg|thumb|right|Signatures of Sir Syed]]\n\nBy 1873, the committee under Sir Syed issued proposals for the construction of a college in Aligarh. He began publishing the journal ''Tahzib-al-Akhlaq'' (''Social Reformer'') on 24 December 1870 to spread awareness and knowledge on modern subjects and promote reforms in Muslim society.<ref>[http://aligarhmovement.com/Chronology_of_Aligarh_Movement A Brief Chronology of Aligarh Movement]. aligarhmovement.com </ref> Sir Syed worked to promote reinterpretation of Muslim ideology in order to reconcile tradition with Western education. He argued in several books on Islam that the Qur'an rested on an appreciation of reason and natural law, making scientific inquiry important to being a good Muslim. Sir Syed established a modern school in Aligarh and, obtaining support from wealthy Muslims and the British, laid the foundation stone of the [[Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College]] on 24 May 1875. He retired from his career as a jurist the following year, concentrating entirely on developing the college and on religious reform.<ref name=\"Bio\" /> Sir Syed's pioneering work received support from the British. Although intensely criticised by orthodox religious leaders hostile to modern influences, Sir Syed's new institution attracted a large student body, mainly drawn from the Muslim gentry and middle classes.<ref name = \"Islam\">{{cite book |title=Islam in Global History |author=Nazeer Ahmed |publisher=Xlibris Corporation |page=231 |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-7388-5966-8}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=December 2017}} The curriculum at the college involved scientific and Western subjects, as well as Oriental subjects and religious education.<ref name=\"Bio\" /> The first [[chancellor (education)|chancellor]] was [[Sultan Shah Jahan, Begum of Bhopal|Sultan Shah Jahan Begum]], a prominent Muslim noblewoman, and Sir Syed invited an Englishman, [[Theodore Beck]], to serve as the first college principal.<ref name=\"Islam\" /> The college was originally affiliated with [[Calcutta University]] but was transferred to the [[Allahabad University]] in 1885. Near the turn of the 20th century, it began publishing its own magazine and established a law school.

In the same year, Sir Syed founded the Muhammadan Association to promote political co-operation amongst Indian Muslims from different parts of the country. In 1886, he organised the [[All India Muhammadan Educational Conference]] in Aligarh, which promoted his vision of modern education and political unity for Muslims. His works made him the most prominent Muslim politician in 19th century India, often influencing the attitude of Muslims on various national issues. He supported the efforts of Indian political leaders [[Surendranath Banerjee]] and [[Dadabhai Naoroji]] to obtain representation for Indians in the government and civil services. In 1883, he founded the Muhammadan Civil Service Fund Association to encourage and support the entry of Muslim graduates into the [[Indian Civil Service]] (ICS).<ref name=\"Bio\" /><ref name=\"RC\">{{cite book |title=Struggle for Freedom |publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan |page=1967 |author=RC Majumdar|id=ASIN: B000HXEOUM |year=1969}}</ref> While fearful of the loss of Muslim political power owing to the community's backwardness, Sir Syed was also averse to the prospect of democratic self-government, which would give control of government to the Hindu-majority population:<ref name=\"Baig\">{{cite book |title=The Muslim Dilemma in India |isbn=9780706903119|publisher=Vikas Publishing House |location=[[Delhi]] |author=M.R.A.

The conference, in addition to generating funds for Ahmad Khan's Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College, motivated Muslim elites to propose expansion of educational uplift elsewhere, known as the [[Aligarh Movement]]. In turn this new awareness of Muslim needs helped stimulate a political consciousness among Muslim elites that went on to form the AIML.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Abdul Rashid Khan|title=All India Muhammadan Educational Conference and the Foundation of the All India Muslim League|journal=Journal of the Pakistan Historical Society|year=2007|volume=55 |issue =1\u20132|pages=65\u201383}}</ref>\n\nOverall, Syed Ahmed is hailed as a Muslim social reformer who promoted communal harmony and peaceful coexistence of all communities in India. In an undivided India under the British rule, he was worried about Muslim backwardness and unwillingness to adopt modern education. He worked towards social and educational upliftment of Muslims so as to enable them to walk shoulder to shoulder with all other communities in India.\n\n==Final years and legacy==\n\nSyed Ahmad is widely commemorated across South Asia as a great Muslim social reformer and visionary.<ref name=\"Bio\" /><ref name=\"RC\" /> At the same time, Syed Ahmad sought to politically ally Muslims with the British government. An avowed loyalist of the [[British Empire]], he was nominated as a member of the Civil Service Commission in 1887 by [[Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava|Lord Dufferin]]. In 1888, he established the [[United Patriotic Association]] at Aligarh to promote political co-operation with the British and Muslim participation in the British government.\n\nSir Syed Ahmed Khan Bahadur lived the last two decades of his life in Aligarh, regarded widely as the mentor of 19th and 20th century Muslim entrepreneurs. Battling illnesses and old age, Sir Syed died on 27 March 1898. He was buried besides [[Sir Syed Masjid]] inside the campus of the [[Aligarh Muslim University]].\n\nThe university he founded remains one of India's most prominent institutions. Prominent alumni of Aligarh include Muslim political leaders Maulana [[Mohammad Ali Jouhar]], [[Abdur Rab Nishtar]], [[Maulana Shaukat Ali]] and [[Maulvi Abdul Haq]], who is hailed in [[Pakistan]] as ''[[Baba-e-Urdu]]'' (''Father of Urdu'').

The radio frequency link establishes a connection to the switching systems of a [[mobile phone operator]], which provides access to the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN). Modern mobile telephone services use a [[cellular network]] architecture and, therefore, mobile telephones are called ''cellular telephones'' or ''cell phones'' in North America. In addition to [[telephony]], 2000s-era mobile phones support a variety of other [[GSM services|services]], such as [[text messaging]], [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]], [[email]], [[Internet access]], short-range wireless communications ([[Infrared Data Association|infrared]], [[Bluetooth]]), business applications, [[video games]] and [[digital photography]].

In 1917, [[Finland|Finnish]] inventor [[Eric Tigerstedt]] filed a patent for a \"pocket-size folding telephone with a very thin carbon microphone\". Early predecessors of cellular phones included [[analog signal|analog]] radio communications from ships and trains. The race to create truly portable telephone devices began after World War II, with developments taking place in many countries. The advances in [[mobile telephony]] have been traced in successive \"generations\", starting with the early zeroth-generation ([[Mobile radio telephone|0G]]) services, such as [[Bell System]]'s [[Mobile Telephone Service]] and its successor, the [[Improved Mobile Telephone Service]].

This sparked competition in the sector as the new operators challenged the incumbent 1G network operators. The GSM standard is a European initiative expressed at the CEPT (\"Conf\u00e9rence Europ\u00e9enne des Postes et Telecommunications\", European Postal and Telecommunications conference). The Franco-German R&D cooperation demonstrated the technical feasibility, and in 1987 was signed the Memorandum of Understanding, between 13 European countries who agreed to launch a commercial service by 1991. The first version of the GSM (=2G) standard had 6.000 pages. The IEEE/RSE awarded to [[Thomas Haug]] and {{ill|Philippe Dupuis (engineer)|lt=Philippe Dupuis|fr|Philippe Dupuis (ing\u00e9nieur)}} the 2018 James Clerk Maxwell medal for their contributions to the first digital mobile telephone standard.<ref>https://www.ieee-ukandireland.org/duke-of-cambridge-presents-maxwell-medals-to-gsm-developers/</ref> In 2018, the GSM was used by over 5 billion people in over 220 countries.

The [[International Telecommunication Union]] measures those with Internet connection, which it calls ''Active Mobile-Broadband subscriptions'' (which includes tablets, etc.). In the developed world, smartphones have now overtaken the usage of earlier mobile systems. However, in the developing world, they account for around 50% of [[mobile telephony]].\n\n===Feature phone===\n{{main|Feature phone}}\nFeature phone is a term typically used as a [[retronym]] to describe [[mobile phones]] which are limited in capabilities in contrast to a modern [[smartphone]]. Feature phones typically provide [[voice calling]] and [[text messaging]] functionality, in addition to basic [[multimedia]] and [[Internet]] capabilities, and other services offered by the user's [[wireless service provider]]. A feature phone has additional functions over and above a basic mobile phone which is only capable of voice calling and text messaging.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/62894/feature-phone|title=feature phone Definition from PC Magazine Encyclopedia|website=www.pcmag.com}}</ref><ref name=\"forbes-twoweeks\">Todd Hixon, [https://www.forbes.com/sites/toddhixon/2012/11/13/two-weeks-with-a-dumb-phone/ Two Weeks With A Dumb Phone], ''Forbes'', 13 November 2012</ref> Feature phones and basic mobile phones tend to use a proprietary, custom-designed [[software]] and [[user interface]]. By contrast, smartphones generally use a [[mobile operating system]] that often shares common traits across devices.\n\n==={{anchor|Kosher phone}}Kosher phone===\nThere are [[Orthodox Jewish]] religious restrictions which, by some interpretations, standard mobile telephones overstep. To deal with this problem, some rabbinical organizations have recommended that phones with text-messaging capability not be used by children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theworld.org/2012/01/kosher-phones-orthodox-jews/|title=Kosher Phones For Britain's Orthodox Jews|work=Public Radio International}}</ref> [[Telephone numbers in Israel#Kosher numbers|Phones with restricted features]] are known as [[kosher]] phones and have [[rabbi]]nical approval for use in Israel and elsewhere by observant Orthodox Jews. Although these phones are intended to prevent [[Immodesty#Judaism|immodesty]], some vendors report good sales to adults who prefer the simplicity of the devices. Some phones are approved for use by essential workers (such as health, security, and public service workers) on the [[Shabbat|sabbath]] (the use of any electrical device is generally prohibited during this time, other than to save lives, or reduce the risk of death or similar needs).<ref name=kosher>{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/154153|title=Introducing: A 'Kosher Phone' Permitted on Shabbat|work=Arutz Sheva}}</ref>\n\n==Infrastructure==\n{{main|Cellular network|WiFi}}\nMobile phones communicate with cell towers that are placed to give coverage across a telephone service area which is divided up into 'cells'. Each cell uses a different set of frequencies from neighboring cells, and will typically be covered by 3 towers placed at different locations. The cell towers are usually interconnected to each other and the phone network and the internet by wired connections. Due to bandwidth limitations each cell will have a maximum number of cell phones it can handle at once. The cells are therefore sized depending on the expected usage density, and may be much smaller in cities. In that case much lower transmitter powers are used to avoid broadcasting beyond the cell.\n\nIn order to handle the high traffic, multiple towers can be setup in the same area(using different frequencies). This can be done permanently or temporarily such as at special events like at the Super Bowl, Taste of Chicago, State Fair, NYC New Year's Eve, hurricane hit cities, etc. where cell phone companies will bring a truck with equipment to host the abnormally high traffic with a portable cell.\n\nCellular can greatly increase the capacity of simultaneous wireless phone calls. While a phone company for example, has a license to 1000 frequencies, each cell must use unique frequencies with each call using one of them when communicating. Because cells only slightly overlap, the same frequency can be reused. Example cell 1 uses frequency 1\u2013500, next door cell uses frequency 501\u20131000, next door can reuse frequency 1\u2013500. Cells 1 and 3 are not \"touching\" and do not overlap/communicate so each can reuse the same frequencies.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nThis is even more greatly increased when phone companies implemented digital networks. With digital, one frequency can host multiple simultaneous calls increasing capacity even more.\n\nAs a phone moves around, a phone will \"hand off\" - automatically disconnect and reconnect to the tower of another cell that gives the best reception.\n\nAdditionally, short-range [[Wi-Fi]] infrastructure is often used by smartphones as much as possible as it offloads traffic from cell networks on to local area networks.\n\n==Hardware==\n{{Main|Mobile phone features}}\n\nThe common components found on all mobile phones are:\n\n* A [[central processing unit]] (CPU), the processor of phones. The CPU is a [[microprocessor]] fabricated on a [[metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor]] (MOS) [[integrated circuit]] (IC) chip.\n* A [[battery (electricity)|battery]], providing the power source for the phone functions. A modern handset typically uses a [[lithium-ion battery]] (LIB), whereas older handsets used [[nickel\u2013metal hydride]] (Ni\u2013MH) batteries.\n* An input mechanism to allow the user to interact with the phone. These are a [[keypad]] for feature phones, and [[touch screens]] for most smartphones (typically with [[capacitive sensing]]).\n* A [[display device|display]] which echoes the user's typing, and displays text messages, contacts, and more. The display is typically either a [[liquid-crystal display]] (LCD) or [[organic light-emitting diode]] (OLED) display.\n* [[Loudspeaker|Speakers]] for sound.\n* [[Subscriber Identity Module]] (SIM) cards and [[Removable User Identity Module]] (R-UIM) cards.\n* A hardware [[notification LED]] on some phones\n\nLow-end mobile phones are often referred to as [[feature phone]]s and offer basic telephony. Handsets with more advanced computing ability through the use of native software applications are known as [[smartphone]]s.\n\n===Central processing unit===\nMobile phones have [[central processing unit]]s (CPUs), similar to those in computers, but optimised to operate in low power environments.\n\nMobile CPU performance depends not only on the clock rate (generally given in multiples of [[hertz]])<ref>{{cite web\n | title = CPU Frequency\n | work = CPU World Glossary\n | publisher = CPU World\n | date = 25 March 2008\n | url = http://www.cpu-world.com/Glossary/C/CPU_Frequency.html\n | accessdate =1 January 2010 }}</ref> but also the [[memory hierarchy]] also greatly affects overall performance. Because of these problems, the performance of mobile phone CPUs is often more appropriately given by scores derived from various standardized tests to measure the real effective performance in commonly used applications.\n\n===Display===\n{{main|Display device}}\nOne of the main characteristics of phones is the [[Display device|screen]]. Depending on the device's type and design, the screen fills most or nearly all of the space on a device's front surface. Many smartphone displays have an [[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]] of [[16:9]], but taller aspect ratios became more common in 2017.\n\nScreen sizes are measured in diagonal [[inch]]es; feature phones generally have screen sizes below 3.5 inches. Phones with screens larger than 5.2 inches are often called \"[[phablet]]s.\" Smartphones with screens over 4.5 inches in size are commonly difficult to use with only a single hand, since most thumbs cannot reach the entire screen surface; they may need to be shifted around in the hand, held in one hand and manipulated by the other, or used in place with both hands. Due to design advances, some modern smartphones with large screen sizes and \"edge-to-edge\" designs have compact builds that improve their ergonomics, while the shift to taller aspect ratios have resulted in phones that have larger screen sizes whilst maintaining the ergonomics associated with smaller 16:9 displays.<ref name=\"phonearena-s7edgenotphablet\">{{cite web|title=Don't call it a phablet: the 5.5\" Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is narrower than many 5.2\" devices|url=http://www.phonearena.com/news/Dont-call-it-a-phablet-the-5.5-Samsung-Galaxy-S7-Edge-is-narrower-than-many-5.2-devices_id79482|website=PhoneArena|accessdate=3 April 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"verge-phabletpytha\">{{cite web|title=We're gonna need Pythagoras' help to compare screen sizes in 2017|url=https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2017/3/30/15120824/screen-aspect-ratio-mathematics-galaxy-s8-lg-g6|website=The Verge|accessdate=3 April 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"verge-s8aspectratio\">{{cite web|title=The Samsung Galaxy S8 will change the way we think about display sizes|url=https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/3/30/15121526/samsung-galaxy-s8-vs-google-pixel-iphone-7-screen-size-comparison|website=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=3 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Liquid-crystal display]]s are the most common; others are [[IPS panel|IPS]], [[LED]], [[OLED]], and [[AMOLED]] displays.

The small speakers can also be used to listen to digital audio files of music or speech or watch videos with an audio component, without holding the phone close to the ear.\n\n===Battery===\nThe average phone battery lasts 2\u20133 years at best. Many of the wireless devices use a Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion) battery, which charges 500\u20132500 times, depending on how users take care of the battery and the charging techniques used.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.phonedog.com/2011/08/07/how-to-prolong-your-cell-phone-battery-s-life-span|title=How To Prolong Your Cell Phone Battery's Life Span|last=Taylor|first=Martin|date=|work=Phonedog.com|access-date=8 June 2018}}</ref> It is only natural for these rechargeable batteries to chemically age, which is why the performance of the battery when used for a year or two will begin to deteriorate.

The SIM card is approximately the size of a small postage stamp and is usually placed underneath the battery in the rear of the unit. The SIM securely stores the [[International Mobile Subscriber Identity|service-subscriber key (IMSI)]] and the [[Authentication Center|K<sub>i</sub>]] used to identify and authenticate the user of the mobile phone. The SIM card allows users to change phones by simply removing the SIM card from one mobile phone and inserting it into another mobile phone or broadband telephony device, provided that this is not prevented by a [[SIM lock]]. The first SIM card was made in 1991 by Munich smart card maker [[Giesecke & Devrient]] for the Finnish wireless network operator [[Radiolinja]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nA hybrid mobile phone can hold up to four [[SIM card]]s, with a phone having an IMEI per SIM Card.

This has introduced additional difficulties for law enforcement officials when attempting to distinguish one usage from another in drivers using their devices. This is more apparent in countries which ban both handheld and hands-free usage, rather than those which ban handheld use only, as officials cannot easily tell which function of the mobile phone is being used simply by looking at the driver.

The radio frequency link establishes a connection to the switching systems of a [[mobile phone operator]], which provides access to the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN). Modern mobile telephone services use a [[cellular network]] architecture and, therefore, mobile telephones are called ''cellular telephones'' or ''cell phones'' in North America. In addition to [[telephony]], 2000s-era mobile phones support a variety of other [[GSM services|services]], such as [[text messaging]], [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]], [[email]], [[Internet access]], short-range wireless communications ([[Infrared Data Association|infrared]], [[Bluetooth]]), business applications, [[video games]] and [[digital photography]].

However, in the developing world, they account for around 50% of [[mobile telephony]].\n\n===Feature phone===\n{{main|Feature phone}}\nFeature phone is a term typically used as a [[retronym]] to describe [[mobile phones]] which are limited in capabilities in contrast to a modern [[smartphone]]. Feature phones typically provide [[voice calling]] and [[text messaging]] functionality, in addition to basic [[multimedia]] and [[Internet]] capabilities, and other services offered by the user's [[wireless service provider]]. A feature phone has additional functions over and above a basic mobile phone which is only capable of voice calling and text messaging.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/62894/feature-phone|title=feature phone Definition from PC Magazine Encyclopedia|website=www.pcmag.com}}</ref><ref name=\"forbes-twoweeks\">Todd Hixon, [https://www.forbes.com/sites/toddhixon/2012/11/13/two-weeks-with-a-dumb-phone/ Two Weeks With A Dumb Phone], ''Forbes'', 13 November 2012</ref> Feature phones and basic mobile phones tend to use a proprietary, custom-designed [[software]] and [[user interface]]. By contrast, smartphones generally use a [[mobile operating system]] that often shares common traits across devices.\n\n==={{anchor|Kosher phone}}Kosher phone===\nThere are [[Orthodox Jewish]] religious restrictions which, by some interpretations, standard mobile telephones overstep. To deal with this problem, some rabbinical organizations have recommended that phones with text-messaging capability not be used by children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theworld.org/2012/01/kosher-phones-orthodox-jews/|title=Kosher Phones For Britain's Orthodox Jews|work=Public Radio International}}</ref> [[Telephone numbers in Israel#Kosher numbers|Phones with restricted features]] are known as [[kosher]] phones and have [[rabbi]]nical approval for use in Israel and elsewhere by observant Orthodox Jews. Although these phones are intended to prevent [[Immodesty#Judaism|immodesty]], some vendors report good sales to adults who prefer the simplicity of the devices. Some phones are approved for use by essential workers (such as health, security, and public service workers) on the [[Shabbat|sabbath]] (the use of any electrical device is generally prohibited during this time, other than to save lives, or reduce the risk of death or similar needs).<ref name=kosher>{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/154153|title=Introducing: A 'Kosher Phone' Permitted on Shabbat|work=Arutz Sheva}}</ref>\n\n==Infrastructure==\n{{main|Cellular network|WiFi}}\nMobile phones communicate with cell towers that are placed to give coverage across a telephone service area which is divided up into 'cells'. Each cell uses a different set of frequencies from neighboring cells, and will typically be covered by 3 towers placed at different locations. The cell towers are usually interconnected to each other and the phone network and the internet by wired connections. Due to bandwidth limitations each cell will have a maximum number of cell phones it can handle at once. The cells are therefore sized depending on the expected usage density, and may be much smaller in cities. In that case much lower transmitter powers are used to avoid broadcasting beyond the cell.\n\nIn order to handle the high traffic, multiple towers can be setup in the same area(using different frequencies). This can be done permanently or temporarily such as at special events like at the Super Bowl, Taste of Chicago, State Fair, NYC New Year's Eve, hurricane hit cities, etc. where cell phone companies will bring a truck with equipment to host the abnormally high traffic with a portable cell.\n\nCellular can greatly increase the capacity of simultaneous wireless phone calls. While a phone company for example, has a license to 1000 frequencies, each cell must use unique frequencies with each call using one of them when communicating. Because cells only slightly overlap, the same frequency can be reused. Example cell 1 uses frequency 1\u2013500, next door cell uses frequency 501\u20131000, next door can reuse frequency 1\u2013500. Cells 1 and 3 are not \"touching\" and do not overlap/communicate so each can reuse the same frequencies.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nThis is even more greatly increased when phone companies implemented digital networks. With digital, one frequency can host multiple simultaneous calls increasing capacity even more.\n\nAs a phone moves around, a phone will \"hand off\" - automatically disconnect and reconnect to the tower of another cell that gives the best reception.\n\nAdditionally, short-range [[Wi-Fi]] infrastructure is often used by smartphones as much as possible as it offloads traffic from cell networks on to local area networks.\n\n==Hardware==\n{{Main|Mobile phone features}}\n\nThe common components found on all mobile phones are:\n\n* A [[central processing unit]] (CPU), the processor of phones. The CPU is a [[microprocessor]] fabricated on a [[metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor]] (MOS) [[integrated circuit]] (IC) chip.\n* A [[battery (electricity)|battery]], providing the power source for the phone functions. A modern handset typically uses a [[lithium-ion battery]] (LIB), whereas older handsets used [[nickel\u2013metal hydride]] (Ni\u2013MH) batteries.\n* An input mechanism to allow the user to interact with the phone. These are a [[keypad]] for feature phones, and [[touch screens]] for most smartphones (typically with [[capacitive sensing]]).\n* A [[display device|display]] which echoes the user's typing, and displays text messages, contacts, and more. The display is typically either a [[liquid-crystal display]] (LCD) or [[organic light-emitting diode]] (OLED) display.\n* [[Loudspeaker|Speakers]] for sound.\n* [[Subscriber Identity Module]] (SIM) cards and [[Removable User Identity Module]] (R-UIM) cards.\n* A hardware [[notification LED]] on some phones\n\nLow-end mobile phones are often referred to as [[feature phone]]s and offer basic telephony. Handsets with more advanced computing ability through the use of native software applications are known as [[smartphone]]s.\n\n===Central processing unit===\nMobile phones have [[central processing unit]]s (CPUs), similar to those in computers, but optimised to operate in low power environments.\n\nMobile CPU performance depends not only on the clock rate (generally given in multiples of [[hertz]])<ref>{{cite web\n | title = CPU Frequency\n | work = CPU World Glossary\n | publisher = CPU World\n | date = 25 March 2008\n | url = http://www.cpu-world.com/Glossary/C/CPU_Frequency.html\n | accessdate =1 January 2010 }}</ref> but also the [[memory hierarchy]] also greatly affects overall performance. Because of these problems, the performance of mobile phone CPUs is often more appropriately given by scores derived from various standardized tests to measure the real effective performance in commonly used applications.\n\n===Display===\n{{main|Display device}}\nOne of the main characteristics of phones is the [[Display device|screen]]. Depending on the device's type and design, the screen fills most or nearly all of the space on a device's front surface. Many smartphone displays have an [[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]] of [[16:9]], but taller aspect ratios became more common in 2017.\n\nScreen sizes are measured in diagonal [[inch]]es; feature phones generally have screen sizes below 3.5 inches. Phones with screens larger than 5.2 inches are often called \"[[phablet]]s.\" Smartphones with screens over 4.5 inches in size are commonly difficult to use with only a single hand, since most thumbs cannot reach the entire screen surface; they may need to be shifted around in the hand, held in one hand and manipulated by the other, or used in place with both hands. Due to design advances, some modern smartphones with large screen sizes and \"edge-to-edge\" designs have compact builds that improve their ergonomics, while the shift to taller aspect ratios have resulted in phones that have larger screen sizes whilst maintaining the ergonomics associated with smaller 16:9 displays.<ref name=\"phonearena-s7edgenotphablet\">{{cite web|title=Don't call it a phablet: the 5.5\" Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is narrower than many 5.2\" devices|url=http://www.phonearena.com/news/Dont-call-it-a-phablet-the-5.5-Samsung-Galaxy-S7-Edge-is-narrower-than-many-5.2-devices_id79482|website=PhoneArena|accessdate=3 April 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"verge-phabletpytha\">{{cite web|title=We're gonna need Pythagoras' help to compare screen sizes in 2017|url=https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2017/3/30/15120824/screen-aspect-ratio-mathematics-galaxy-s8-lg-g6|website=The Verge|accessdate=3 April 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"verge-s8aspectratio\">{{cite web|title=The Samsung Galaxy S8 will change the way we think about display sizes|url=https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/3/30/15121526/samsung-galaxy-s8-vs-google-pixel-iphone-7-screen-size-comparison|website=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=3 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Liquid-crystal display]]s are the most common; others are [[IPS panel|IPS]], [[LED]], [[OLED]], and [[AMOLED]] displays.

Some audio-quality enhancing features, such as [[Voice over LTE]] and [[HD Voice]], have appeared and are often available on newer smartphones.  Sound quality can remain a problem due to the design of the phone, the quality of the cellular network and compression algorithms used in [[long-distance call]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/wireless/why-mobile-voice-quality-still-stinksand-how-to-fix-it|title=Why Mobile Voice Quality Still Stinks\u2014and How to Fix It|author=Jeff Hecht|work=ieee.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-is-cell-phone-call-quality-so-terrible|title=Why Is Cell Phone Call Quality So Terrible?|author=Elena Malykhina|work=scientificamerican.com}}</ref>  Audio quality can be improved using a [[VoIP]] application over [[WiFi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lifehacker.com/whats-the-best-mobile-voip-app-1579791681|title=What's the Best Mobile VoIP App?|author=Alan Henry|publisher=Gawker Media|work=Lifehacker}}</ref> Cellphones have small speakers so that the user can use a [[speakerphone]] feature and talk to a person on the phone without holding it to their ear. The small speakers can also be used to listen to digital audio files of music or speech or watch videos with an audio component, without holding the phone close to the ear.\n\n===Battery===\nThe average phone battery lasts 2\u20133 years at best. Many of the wireless devices use a Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion) battery, which charges 500\u20132500 times, depending on how users take care of the battery and the charging techniques used.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.phonedog.com/2011/08/07/how-to-prolong-your-cell-phone-battery-s-life-span|title=How To Prolong Your Cell Phone Battery's Life Span|last=Taylor|first=Martin|date=|work=Phonedog.com|access-date=8 June 2018}}</ref> It is only natural for these rechargeable batteries to chemically age, which is why the performance of the battery when used for a year or two will begin to deteriorate.

The SIM card is approximately the size of a small postage stamp and is usually placed underneath the battery in the rear of the unit. The SIM securely stores the [[International Mobile Subscriber Identity|service-subscriber key (IMSI)]] and the [[Authentication Center|K<sub>i</sub>]] used to identify and authenticate the user of the mobile phone. The SIM card allows users to change phones by simply removing the SIM card from one mobile phone and inserting it into another mobile phone or broadband telephony device, provided that this is not prevented by a [[SIM lock]]. The first SIM card was made in 1991 by Munich smart card maker [[Giesecke & Devrient]] for the Finnish wireless network operator [[Radiolinja]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nA hybrid mobile phone can hold up to four [[SIM card]]s, with a phone having an IMEI per SIM Card.

The first SMS message was sent from a computer to a mobile phone in 1992 in the UK while the first person-to-person SMS from phone to phone was sent in Finland in 1993. The first [[mobile news]] service, delivered via SMS, was launched in Finland in 2000,{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} and subsequently many organizations provided \"on-demand\" and \"instant\" news services by SMS.
