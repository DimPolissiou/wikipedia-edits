During November and December 2002, an archaeological survey was carried out in the area by a French team of researchers. The expedition's objective was to search for rock shelters and caves containing stratified archaeological infills capable of documenting the period when production economy appeared in this part of Somaliland (circa [[5th millennium BCE|5th]] and 2nd millennium BCE). During the course of the survey, the French archaeological team discovered the Laas Geel [[rock art]], encompassing an area of ten rock alcoves (caves). In an excellent state of preservation, the paintings show human figures with their hands raised and facing long-horned, humpless [[cattle]].<ref name=\"African Archeology Volume 1 2003\">The Journal of African Archeology Volume 1.2 (2003) Chapter 3</ref>\n\nThe rock art had been known to the area's inhabitants for centuries before the French discovery. However, the existence of the site had not been broadcast to the international community. In November 2003, a mission returned to Laas Geel and a team of experts undertook a detailed study of the paintings and their prehistoric context.\n\nSomaliland in general is home to numerous such [[archaeological site]]s, with similar rock art and/or ancient edifices such as the [[Dhambalin]] rock art. However, many of these old structures have yet to be properly explored, a process which would help shed further light on local history and facilitate their preservation for posterity.<ref name=\"Hodd\">Michael Hodd, ''East African Handbook'', (Trade & Travel Publications: 1994), p.640.</ref>\n\n===The Big commune===\n\nAccording to traditional poetic (gabay) oral accounts, Hargeisa was founded by the [[Eidagale]] clan as a watering and trading stop for passing nomads and caravans.

Supplies of rice, tobacco, and dates can sometimes be bought here in the trading season. Some four hundred people are employed looking after the jowari fields, and may be seen sitting on platforms, shouting and throwing stones to scare birds from the crops. There is abundance of good water in the bed of the river, and a masonry well has been built, and is kept in order by an Arab from Aden.

During November and December 2002, an archaeological survey was carried out in the area by a French team of researchers. The expedition's objective was to search for rock shelters and caves containing stratified archaeological infills capable of documenting the period when production economy appeared in this part of Somaliland (circa [[5th millennium BCE|5th]] and 2nd millennium BCE). During the course of the survey, the French archaeological team discovered the Laas Geel [[rock art]], encompassing an area of ten rock alcoves (caves). In an excellent state of preservation, the paintings show human figures with their hands raised and facing long-horned, humpless [[cattle]].<ref name=\"African Archeology Volume 1 2003\">The Journal of African Archeology Volume 1.2 (2003) Chapter 3</ref>\n\nThe rock art had been known to the area's inhabitants for centuries before the French discovery. However, the existence of the site had not been broadcast to the international community. In November 2003, a mission returned to Laas Geel and a team of experts undertook a detailed study of the paintings and their prehistoric context.\n\nSomaliland in general is home to numerous such [[archaeological site]]s, with similar rock art and/or ancient edifices such as the [[Dhambalin]] rock art. However, many of these old structures have yet to be properly explored, a process which would help shed further light on local history and facilitate their preservation for posterity.<ref name=\"Hodd\">Michael Hodd, ''East African Handbook'', (Trade & Travel Publications: 1994), p.640.</ref>\n\n===The Big commune===\n\nAccording to traditional poetic (gabay) oral accounts, Hargeisa was founded by the [[Eidagale]] clan as a watering and trading stop for passing nomads and caravans.

Round the place is a patch of jowari [Sorghum] cultivation, two and a half miles long and a quarter of a mile broad. Quantities of livestock of all kinds graze on the low undulating hills for half a mile from the Aleyadera nala on either bank. Hargeisa is situated on two important caravan routes, one from Ogaden and the other from Harar. There are good direct camel-roads to Berbera and Bulhar. Supplies of rice, tobacco, and dates can sometimes be bought here in the trading season.

Near Hargeisa are the fertile Sheikh and [[Daallo Mountain|Daallo]] mountains, which receive large amounts of [[rain]]. South of the city is the [[Haud]] savannah ([[Baligubadle]]), which attracts many different species of wildlife to graze in the area.\n\nHargeisa is situated near the town of [[Gabiley]], which serves as an agricultural centre in Somaliland. That town's Allay-Baday area produces tons of tomatoes and onions each month during the rainy season. The town of [[Arabsiyo]] is also located nearby, and is noted for its lemon production.\n\nDue to its relative fertility and greenery, wild animals come to the Hargeisa area to either breed or graze on the grassland savannah. Fauna that can be found in rural sections of the city include the [[kudu]], [[wild boar]]s, [[Somali wild ass]], [[warthog]]s, [[antelope]]s, [[Somali sheep]], [[goat]]s, [[camel]]s, and many different types of [[bird]]s.

Edmund English purchased the grant on 23 May 1854 for around 400 pounds. It officially became known as Kogarah Park when it was acquired by the Department of Lands on 1 July 1896 and dedicated as the first public park in [[Kogarah, New South Wales|Kogarah]]. Control of the park was eventually passed to the Council of the [[Municipality of Kogarah]] on 29 August 1906, which became Kogarah City and on 12 May 2016 [[Georges River Council]].\n\nDuring Kogarah\u2019s Jubilee celebrations in 1935, Jubilee Stadium was constructed in Kogarah Park.\n\n==Development==\nThe ground was closed from 1986 until the end of 1988 because of the construction of the new grandstand being built on the western side of the ground. During this time the Dragons played their home games at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] in [[1986 NSWRL season|1986]] and [[1987 NSWRL season|1987]], while using [[Belmore Oval]], the home of the [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs]], in [[1988 NSWRL season|1988]].\n\nSince 2003, Jubilee Oval has been steadily upgraded in a three-stage plan, funded by the NSW State Government and Federal Government. In 2006, the ground had been updated with new features to the seating around the grandstand and features directly out of the stadium including re-developments to the Hall of Fame walk and Kogarah Park in front of the stadium. Stage 1 consisted of new terraced seating at the north-western end, perimeter seating at the base of the hill, and a regrassed and raised hill area. Floodlights for televising night matches were also installed.\n\nIn 2007, the Dragons announced that they would not be playing home games at Kogarah for the [[National Rugby League season 2008|2008 season]] so that Stage 2 redevelopment of the ground could be completed with new roofed extension on the Southern side of the main grandstand increasing capacity by around 2000, and further upgrading to the hill area, including turnstile facilities and strengthening the retaining wall at the Southern Jubilee Avenue end. The Dragons returned for 2009 against the Sharks in round 3, and broke the club record for highest Crowd at the ground.\n\nIn 2010, the Dragons secured $13m from the NSW State Government to complete the Stage 3 Northern grandstand extension, with an additional 1580 seats and the replacement of 1730 seats in the existing main grandstand.<ref>[http://www.nrl.com/NewsViews/LatestNews/NewsArticle/tabid/10874/newsId/60603/Default.aspx $13 million Govt boost to upgrade WIN Jubilee Oval \u2013 NRL.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Also included in the development are additional public toilets and facilities, refurbishment of the existing grandstand facilities including the team change rooms, a new passenger and service lift, additional corporate and multi purpose facilities, and a museum and merchandise store.\n\nA new digital scoreboard and several satellite scoreboards, new security system, turnstiles and ticketing facilities at Gate B and a rainwater harvesting tank were also installed around the ground during 2010 and 2011. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dragons.com.au/default.aspx?s%3Darticle-display%26id%3D32333%26work-continuing-at-dragons-home-venues |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215012516/http://www.dragons.com.au/default.aspx?s=article-display&id=32333&work-continuing-at-dragons-home-venues |archivedate=15 December 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n==Walk of Fame==\n\nIn March 2004 a Legends Walk at Kogarah Oval was opened, with 16 club greats inducted into a hall of fame.<ref>{{cite news|last=Brad Walter and Steve Mascord|title=Broncos' teenage prodigy in the Hunt for a baptism of fire against the Warriors|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&sy=smh&kw=fame&pb=all_pubs&dt=enterRange&dr=1month&sd=05%2F03%2F2004&ed=08%2F03%2F2004&so=relevance&sf=text&sf=headline&rc=10&rm=200&sp=adv&clsPage=1&docID=SMH040308UB84E742UEE|accessdate=1 January 2014|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=8 March 2004}}</ref>\n\n[[Brian Clay|Brian `Poppa` Clay]] \u2022 [[Mark Coyne (rugby league)|Mark Coyne]] \u2022 [[Reg Gasnier]] \u2022 [[Ken Kearney]] \u2022 [[Johnny King]] \u2022 [[Graeme Langlands]] \u2022 [[Eddie Lumsden]] \u2022 [[Matt McCoy (rugby league)|Matt McCoy]] \u2022 [[Noel Pidding]] \u2022 [[Norm Provan]] \u2022 [[John Raper]] \u2022 [[Rod Reddy|Rod `Rocket` Reddy]] \u2022 [[Kevin Ryan (rugby)|Kevin Ryan]] \u2022 [[Billy Smith (rugby league)|Billy Smith]] \u2022 [[Ian Walsh (rugby league)|Ian Walsh]] \u2022 [[Billy Wilson (rugby league)|Billy Wilson]] \u2022 [[Craig Young]] \u2022 Robert Stone\n\n==Naming Rights==\n[[File:Jubilee Oval at night.jpg|thumb|right|A view of the main grandstand during a match between the [[St. George Illawarra Dragons]] and [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]] in March 2019.]]\nFrom 1950 until 2003, the ground was simply known as Jubilee Oval.\n\nIn 2003, printing and data communications company [[Oki Electric Industry|OKI]] signed a five-year sponsorship deal for naming rights to the ground with the name becoming OKI Jubilee Stadium.

Saints at this stage were still based at Arncliffe\u2019s [[Earl Park, Arncliffe|Earl Park]] and it wasn\u2019t until 1950 that Saints returned home to Jubilee Stadium.\n\nThe Dragons played their first official match at the ground on 22 April 1950 against the [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]] before 12,500 fans. The Dragons lost a rather exciting match 17\u201315 but defeat would become quite a rare sight for the Dragons over the coming decades while at Kogarah.\n\nSt. George were based at Kogarah during their world record breaking 11 successive premierships from 1956 to 1966. They set a record at Kogarah and were not beaten at home for an astonishing twelve years: originally beaten by the [[Balmain Tigers]] on 26 June 1954 at Kogarah which was just before the beginning of the streak. It wasn\u2019t until 31 July 1966, that they tasted defeat at Kogarah again, eventually losing 12\u20139 to the [[Western Suburbs Magpies]].\n\nIn 1950, the Dragons began a permanent association with the ground. Around this time was also when St. George legend [[Norm Provan]] joined the club and he said of Kogarah:\n\n{{cquote|The qualities of the club from Kogarah are not easy for me to put into words... Saints are special. I will certainly never forget my years at Kogarah, and at the club across the Princes Highway. At St.George I found qualities that enriched my life \u2013 friendship, unswerving loyalty, fair play and healthy ambition, the learning to win, and to lose.}}\n\nThe team was based at Jubilee Stadium right up until the completion of the 1985 season. They then chose to abandon the ground and relocated to the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]]. The decision was one which they would come to dread. In 1985 St. George had been Club champions, 1st Grade Minor premiers, 1st Grade Runners-Up, Reserve Grade Premiers and Under-23s Premiers. In 1986 Saints missed the semi-finals in all 3 grades for the first time in 50 years. The fans of the club became angry at the club's decision and stayed away from the club in droves while the Dragons remained at the SCG for a further season.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nIn 1988 the opportunity came for the club to relocate again. Instead of moving back to Jubilee they decided to move to [[Belmore Sports Ground|Belmore Oval]]. Finally, in 1988 it was decided that the Saints would move home to Jubilee in 1989 with a new stand to be constructed for the 1990 season.\n\nThe club yet again moved in the late 1990s and explained to fans the decision was on the basis that Jubilee was too small to accommodate a proposed $30 million stadium complex to meet [[National Rugby League|NRL]] requirements for playing venues. In a joint statement, Kogarah Council and St. George DRLFC stated that the scale of the proposed 20,000 seat stadium would exceed the size of Jubilee Oval and affect residents. The decision to leave Jubilee upset many of St George Illawarra's loyal supporters as the ground had so much history to it and in July 2000 many supporters held a rally in support of the ground.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} In March 2002, the R2K (Return to Kogarah) group held a successful Information Night at the Kogarah RSL to support a return to Jubilee Oval and successfully lobbied for the Dragons to play matches at Kogarah from 2003 onwards.\n\n====St George Illawarra Dragons====\n[[File:Jubilee Oval in 2018.jpg|thumb|right|A view of the ground prior to a match between the [[St. George Illawarra Dragons]] and [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs]] in August 2018.]]\nThe [[St George Illawarra Dragons]], formed as the result of a merger between St George and the [[Illawarra Steelers]] in 1999, use Kogarah as one of their home grounds in the [[National Rugby League]], along with the Steelers former home, [[WIN Stadium]] in [[Wollongong]]. The newly formed Dragons used Kogarah in the [[1999 NRL season]], before moving their games to the [[Sydney Football Stadium]] (SFS) in 2000.\n\nFrom 2000 until 2002, after many loyal Dragons supporters held a rally and Information Night to persuade the club to move back to Jubilee Stadium (while at the SFS, the team had continued using WIN Stadium), the club did so and would be yet again occupying the famous [[Rugby league playing field|rugby league ground]]. During these 3 years that the Dragons did not play at Kogarah, there were talks with the club that they would play at the nearby [[St George Soccer Stadium]], but plans fell through and the soccer stadium has since fallen into disrepair. The Dragons returned to Kogarah in 2003 after a high number of protests and rallies held by supporter group R2K (or Return to Kogarah).\n\nLights were installed at Kogarah in 2006, with the Dragons christening their first night game at the ground with an 8\u20131 win over the [[Parramatta Eels]] in Round 13 of the [[2006 NRL season|2006 season]]. The game was played in driving rain, which many gave as the reason for a crowd of only 9,075 in attendance.\n\nThe club did not play at the ground in [[2008 NRL season|2008]] because of renovations of the south-western end grandstand being built. During this time, the Dragons played at [[Stadium Australia|ANZ Stadium]]. They returned to Kogarah in [[2009 NRL season|2009]], where they have remained ever since.\n\n===Association Football===\n[[Sydney Olympic FC]] played at Jubilee Stadium in their 2003/2004 season, competing in the [[National Soccer League]].\n\nOn 4 December 2011, it marked the first time an [[A-League]] club played a first grade competition game at the venue, with [[Sydney FC]] playing [[Brisbane Roar FC]], in front of a crowd of 11,555.<ref>[https://archive.is/20121230125906/http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/sydneyfc/news-display/Lavicka%20laments%20another%20slow%20start/43051 Lavicka laments another slow start], [[Football Federation Australia]], 28 November 2011.

During this time the Dragons played their home games at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] in [[1986 NSWRL season|1986]] and [[1987 NSWRL season|1987]], while using [[Belmore Oval]], the home of the [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs]], in [[1988 NSWRL season|1988]].\n\nSince 2003, Jubilee Oval has been steadily upgraded in a three-stage plan, funded by the NSW State Government and Federal Government. In 2006, the ground had been updated with new features to the seating around the grandstand and features directly out of the stadium including re-developments to the Hall of Fame walk and Kogarah Park in front of the stadium. Stage 1 consisted of new terraced seating at the north-western end, perimeter seating at the base of the hill, and a regrassed and raised hill area. Floodlights for televising night matches were also installed.\n\nIn 2007, the Dragons announced that they would not be playing home games at Kogarah for the [[National Rugby League season 2008|2008 season]] so that Stage 2 redevelopment of the ground could be completed with new roofed extension on the Southern side of the main grandstand increasing capacity by around 2000, and further upgrading to the hill area, including turnstile facilities and strengthening the retaining wall at the Southern Jubilee Avenue end. The Dragons returned for 2009 against the Sharks in round 3, and broke the club record for highest Crowd at the ground.\n\nIn 2010, the Dragons secured $13m from the NSW State Government to complete the Stage 3 Northern grandstand extension, with an additional 1580 seats and the replacement of 1730 seats in the existing main grandstand.<ref>[http://www.nrl.com/NewsViews/LatestNews/NewsArticle/tabid/10874/newsId/60603/Default.aspx $13 million Govt boost to upgrade WIN Jubilee Oval \u2013 NRL.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Also included in the development are additional public toilets and facilities, refurbishment of the existing grandstand facilities including the team change rooms, a new passenger and service lift, additional corporate and multi purpose facilities, and a museum and merchandise store.\n\nA new digital scoreboard and several satellite scoreboards, new security system, turnstiles and ticketing facilities at Gate B and a rainwater harvesting tank were also installed around the ground during 2010 and 2011. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dragons.com.au/default.aspx?s%3Darticle-display%26id%3D32333%26work-continuing-at-dragons-home-venues |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215012516/http://www.dragons.com.au/default.aspx?s=article-display&id=32333&work-continuing-at-dragons-home-venues |archivedate=15 December 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n==Walk of Fame==\n\nIn March 2004 a Legends Walk at Kogarah Oval was opened, with 16 club greats inducted into a hall of fame.<ref>{{cite news|last=Brad Walter and Steve Mascord|title=Broncos' teenage prodigy in the Hunt for a baptism of fire against the Warriors|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&sy=smh&kw=fame&pb=all_pubs&dt=enterRange&dr=1month&sd=05%2F03%2F2004&ed=08%2F03%2F2004&so=relevance&sf=text&sf=headline&rc=10&rm=200&sp=adv&clsPage=1&docID=SMH040308UB84E742UEE|accessdate=1 January 2014|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=8 March 2004}}</ref>\n\n[[Brian Clay|Brian `Poppa` Clay]] \u2022 [[Mark Coyne (rugby league)|Mark Coyne]] \u2022 [[Reg Gasnier]] \u2022 [[Ken Kearney]] \u2022 [[Johnny King]] \u2022 [[Graeme Langlands]] \u2022 [[Eddie Lumsden]] \u2022 [[Matt McCoy (rugby league)|Matt McCoy]] \u2022 [[Noel Pidding]] \u2022 [[Norm Provan]] \u2022 [[John Raper]] \u2022 [[Rod Reddy|Rod `Rocket` Reddy]] \u2022 [[Kevin Ryan (rugby)|Kevin Ryan]] \u2022 [[Billy Smith (rugby league)|Billy Smith]] \u2022 [[Ian Walsh (rugby league)|Ian Walsh]] \u2022 [[Billy Wilson (rugby league)|Billy Wilson]] \u2022 [[Craig Young]] \u2022 Robert Stone\n\n==Naming Rights==\n[[File:Jubilee Oval at night.jpg|thumb|right|A view of the main grandstand during a match between the [[St. George Illawarra Dragons]] and [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]] in March 2019.]]\nFrom 1950 until 2003, the ground was simply known as Jubilee Oval.\n\nIn 2003, printing and data communications company [[Oki Electric Industry|OKI]] signed a five-year sponsorship deal for naming rights to the ground with the name becoming OKI Jubilee Stadium. In October, 2008, OKI Printing Solutions decided not to renew the naming rights of Jubilee Oval, as the Dragons played at [[ANZ Stadium]] during the 2008 season due to re-developments at Jubilee.

Saints at this stage were still based at Arncliffe\u2019s [[Earl Park, Arncliffe|Earl Park]] and it wasn\u2019t until 1950 that Saints returned home to Jubilee Stadium.\n\nThe Dragons played their first official match at the ground on 22 April 1950 against the [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]] before 12,500 fans. The Dragons lost a rather exciting match 17\u201315 but defeat would become quite a rare sight for the Dragons over the coming decades while at Kogarah.\n\nSt. George were based at Kogarah during their world record breaking 11 successive premierships from 1956 to 1966. They set a record at Kogarah and were not beaten at home for an astonishing twelve years: originally beaten by the [[Balmain Tigers]] on 26 June 1954 at Kogarah which was just before the beginning of the streak. It wasn\u2019t until 31 July 1966, that they tasted defeat at Kogarah again, eventually losing 12\u20139 to the [[Western Suburbs Magpies]].\n\nIn 1950, the Dragons began a permanent association with the ground. Around this time was also when St. George legend [[Norm Provan]] joined the club and he said of Kogarah:\n\n{{cquote|The qualities of the club from Kogarah are not easy for me to put into words... Saints are special. I will certainly never forget my years at Kogarah, and at the club across the Princes Highway. At St.George I found qualities that enriched my life \u2013 friendship, unswerving loyalty, fair play and healthy ambition, the learning to win, and to lose.}}\n\nThe team was based at Jubilee Stadium right up until the completion of the 1985 season. They then chose to abandon the ground and relocated to the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]]. The decision was one which they would come to dread. In 1985 St. George had been Club champions, 1st Grade Minor premiers, 1st Grade Runners-Up, Reserve Grade Premiers and Under-23s Premiers. In 1986 Saints missed the semi-finals in all 3 grades for the first time in 50 years. The fans of the club became angry at the club's decision and stayed away from the club in droves while the Dragons remained at the SCG for a further season.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nIn 1988 the opportunity came for the club to relocate again. Instead of moving back to Jubilee they decided to move to [[Belmore Sports Ground|Belmore Oval]]. Finally, in 1988 it was decided that the Saints would move home to Jubilee in 1989 with a new stand to be constructed for the 1990 season.\n\nThe club yet again moved in the late 90's and explained to fans the decision was on the basis that Jubilee was too small to accommodate a proposed $30 million stadium complex to meet [[National Rugby League|NRL]] requirements for playing venues. In a joint statement, Kogarah Council and St. George DRLFC stated that the scale of the proposed 20,000 seat stadium would exceed the size of Jubilee Oval and affect residents. The decision to leave Jubilee upset many of St George Illawarra's loyal supporters as the ground had so much history to it and in July 2000 many supporters held a rally in support of the ground.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} In March 2002, the R2K (Return to Kogarah) group held a successful Information Night at the Kogarah RSL to support a return to Jubilee Oval and successfully lobbied for the Dragons to play matches at Kogarah from 2003 onwards.\n\n====St George Illawarra Dragons====\n[[File:Jubilee Oval in 2018.jpg|thumb|right|A view of the ground prior to a match between the [[St. George Illawarra Dragons]] and [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs]] in August 2018.]]\nThe [[St George Illawarra Dragons]], formed as the result of a merger between St George and the [[Illawarra Steelers]] in 1999, use Kogarah as one of their home grounds in the [[National Rugby League]], along with the Steelers former home, [[WIN Stadium]] in [[Wollongong]]. The newly formed Dragons used Kogarah in the [[1999 NRL season]], before moving their games to the [[Sydney Football Stadium]] (SFS) in 2000.\n\nFrom 2000 until 2002, after many loyal Dragons supporters held a rally and Information Night to persuade the club to move back to Jubilee Stadium (while at the SFS, the team had continued using WIN Stadium), the club did so and would be yet again occupying the famous [[Rugby league playing field|rugby league ground]]. During these 3 years that the Dragons did not play at Kogarah, there were talks with the club that they would play at the nearby [[St George Soccer Stadium]], but plans fell through and the soccer stadium has since fallen into disrepair. The Dragons returned to Kogarah in 2003 after a high number of protests and rallies held by supporter group R2K (or Return to Kogarah).\n\nLights were installed at Kogarah in 2006, with the Dragons christening their first night game at the ground with an 8\u20131 win over the [[Parramatta Eels]] in Round 13 of the [[2006 NRL season|2006 season]]. The game was played in driving rain, which many gave as the reason for a crowd of only 9,075 in attendance.\n\nThe club did not play at the ground in [[2008 NRL season|2008]] because of renovations of the south-western end grandstand being built. During this time, the Dragons played at [[Stadium Australia|ANZ Stadium]]. They returned to Kogarah in [[2009 NRL season|2009]], where they have remained ever since.\n\n===Association Football===\n[[Sydney Olympic FC]] played at Jubilee Stadium in their 2003/2004 season, competing in the [[National Soccer League]].\n\nOn 4 December 2011, it marked the first time an [[A-League]] club played a first grade competition game at the venue, with [[Sydney FC]] playing [[Brisbane Roar FC]], in front of a crowd of 11,555.<ref>[https://archive.is/20121230125906/http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/sydneyfc/news-display/Lavicka%20laments%20another%20slow%20start/43051 Lavicka laments another slow start], [[Football Federation Australia]], 28 November 2011.

Often the abscess will start as an internal wound caused by ulceration, hard stool, or penetrative objects with insufficient lubrication.  This wound typically becomes infected as a result of the normal presence of feces in the rectal area, and then develops into an abscess.  This often presents itself as a lump of tissue near the [[anus]] which grows larger and more painful with time.  Like other abscesses, perianal abscesses may require prompt medical treatment, such as an incision and [[debridement]] or [[Lancing (surgical procedure)|lancing]].\n\n{{Anchor|Incisional abscess}}\n\n===Incisional abscess===\nAn ''incisional abscess'' is one that develops as a complication secondary to a [[surgical incision]].

The cytokines trigger an [[inflammation|inflammatory response]], which draws large numbers of [[white blood cell]]s to the area and increases the regional blood flow.\n\nThe final structure of the abscess is an abscess wall, or capsule, that is formed by the adjacent healthy cells in an attempt to keep the pus from infecting neighboring structures.

The drainage of a lung abscess may be performed by positioning the patient in a way that enables the contents to be discharged via the [[respiratory tract]].  Warm compresses and elevation of the limb may be beneficial for a skin abscess.\n\n=== Antibiotics ===\nMost people who have an uncomplicated skin abscess should not use antibiotics.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/> Antibiotics in addition to standard incision and drainage is recommended in persons with severe abscesses, many sites of infection, rapid disease progression, the presence of [[cellulitis]], symptoms indicating bacterial illness throughout the body, or a health condition causing [[immunosuppression]].<ref name=NEJM2014/> People who are very young or very old may also need antibiotics.<ref name=NEJM2014/> If the abscess does not heal only with incision and drainage, or if the abscess is in a place that is difficult to drain such as the face, hands, or genitals, then antibiotics may be indicated.<ref name=NEJM2014/>\n\nIn those cases of abscess which do require antibiotic treatment, ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' bacteria is a common cause and an anti-staphylococcus antibiotic such as [[flucloxacillin]] or [[dicloxacillin]] is used. The [[Infectious Diseases Society of America]] advises that the draining of an abscess is not enough to address community-acquired [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA), and in those cases, traditional antibiotics may be ineffective.<ref name=NEJM2014/> Alternative antibiotics effective against community-acquired MRSA often include [[clindamycin]], [[doxycycline]], [[minocycline]], and [[trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole]].<ref name=NEJM2014/> The [[American College of Emergency Physicians]] advises that typical cases of abscess from MRSA get no benefit from having antibiotic treatment in addition to the standard treatment.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/> If the condition is thought to be [[cellulitis]] rather than abscess, consideration should be given to possibility of strep species as cause that are still sensitive to traditional anti-staphylococcus agents such as dicloxacillin or cephalexin in patients able to tolerate penicillin. [[Antibiotic]] therapy alone without surgical drainage of the abscess is seldom effective due to antibiotics often being unable to get into the abscess and their ineffectiveness at low [[pH]] levels.\n\n[[Cell culture|Culturing the wound]] is not needed if standard follow-up care can be provided after the incision and drainage.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/> Performing a wound culture is unnecessary because it rarely gives information which can be used to guide treatment.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/>\n\n===Packing===\nIn North America, after drainage, an abscess cavity is often packed, perhaps with cloth, in an attempt to protect the healing wound. However, evidence from emergency medicine literature reports that packing wounds after draining causes pain to the person and does not decrease the rate of recurrence, nor bring faster healing or fewer physician visits.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bergstrom|first=KG|title=News, views, and reviews.

Often the abscess will start as an internal wound caused by ulceration, hard stool, or penetrative objects with insufficient lubrication.

The drainage of a lung abscess may be performed by positioning the patient in a way that enables the contents to be discharged via the [[respiratory tract]].  Warm compresses and elevation of the limb may be beneficial for a skin abscess.\n\n=== Antibiotics ===\nMost people who have an uncomplicated skin abscess should not use antibiotics.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/> Antibiotics in addition to standard incision and drainage is recommended in persons with severe abscesses, many sites of infection, rapid disease progression, the presence of [[cellulitis]], symptoms indicating bacterial illness throughout the body, or a health condition causing [[immunosuppression]].<ref name=NEJM2014/> People who are very young or very old may also need antibiotics.<ref name=NEJM2014/> If the abscess does not heal only with incision and drainage, or if the abscess is in a place that is difficult to drain such as the face, hands, or genitals, then antibiotics may be indicated.<ref name=NEJM2014/>\n\nIn those cases of abscess which do require antibiotic treatment, ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' bacteria is a common cause and an anti-staphylococcus antibiotic such as [[flucloxacillin]] or [[dicloxacillin]] is used. The [[Infectious Diseases Society of America]] advises that the draining of an abscess is not enough to address community-acquired [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA), and in those cases, traditional antibiotics may be ineffective.<ref name=NEJM2014/> Alternative antibiotics effective against community-acquired MRSA often include [[clindamycin]], [[doxycycline]], [[minocycline]], and [[trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole]].<ref name=NEJM2014/> The [[American College of Emergency Physicians]] advises that typical cases of abscess from MRSA get no benefit from having antibiotic treatment in addition to the standard treatment.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/> If the condition is thought to be [[cellulitis]] rather than abscess, consideration should be given to possibility of strep species as cause that are still sensitive to traditional anti-staphylococcus agents such as dicloxacillin or cephalexin in patients able to tolerate penicillin. [[Antibiotic]] therapy alone without surgical drainage of the abscess is seldom effective due to antibiotics often being unable to get into the abscess and their ineffectiveness at low [[pH]] levels.\n\n[[Cell culture|Culturing the wound]] is not needed if standard follow-up care can be provided after the incision and drainage.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/> Performing a wound culture is unnecessary because it rarely gives information which can be used to guide treatment.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/>\n\n===Packing===\nIn North America, after drainage, an abscess cavity is often packed, perhaps with cloth, in an attempt to protect the healing wound. However, evidence from emergency medicine literature reports that packing wounds after draining causes pain to the person and does not decrease the rate of recurrence, nor bring faster healing or fewer physician visits.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bergstrom|first=KG|title=News, views, and reviews.

For applications where exact values are necessary, the BFV scheme is the only choice.\n* '''CKKS'''<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cheon|first=Jung Hee|last2=Kim|first2=Andrey|last3=Kim|first3=Miran|last4=Song|first4=Yongsoo|date=2017|editor-last=Takagi|editor-first=Tsuyoshi|editor2-last=Peyrin|editor2-first=Thomas|title=Homomorphic Encryption for Arithmetic of Approximate Numbers|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-70694-8_15|journal=Advances in Cryptology \u2013 ASIACRYPT 2017|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|language=en|location=Cham|publisher=Springer International Publishing|pages=409\u2013437|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-70694-8_15|isbn=978-3-319-70694-8}}</ref>: The CKKS scheme allows additions and multiplications on encrypted real or complex numbers, but yields only approximate results. In applications such as summing up encrypted real numbers, evaluating machine learning models on encrypted data, or computing distances of encrypted locations CKKS is going to be by far the best choice. \n\n=== Compression ===\nData compression can be achieved by building SEAL with [[Zlib]] support. By default, data is compressed using the [[DEFLATE]] algorithm which achieves significant memory footprint savings when serializing objects such as encryption parameters, ciphertexts, plaintexts, and all available keys: Public, Secret, Relin (relinearization), and Galois.
