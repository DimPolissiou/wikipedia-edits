{"title_page": "Hoti (tribe)", "text_new": "{{Template:Albanian tribes sidebar}}\n[[File:Overview of Albanian tribes, Franz Seiner, 1918.jpg|thumb|Albanian ''bayraks'' as of 1918. Hoti and Gruda on the far left side.]]\n'''Hoti''' is a historical [[Tribes of Albania|Albanian tribe]] (''klan'') and sub-region of [[Mal\u00ebsia]], a divided area located in northern [[Albania]] and southern [[Montenegro]]. Its geography is mostly mountainous, but some of its villages are on flat terrain near the banks of Lake Skadar.\n\nHoti was mentioned for the first time in 1330 and fully formed as a community in the mid-to-late 15th century. In its long history, Hoti played an important role in regional politics as a leading community in the northern Albanian tribal structure and as a semi-autonomous area in the borderlands between the Ottoman and Austrian empires and later Montenegro. In 1879, Hoti and [[Gruda (tribe)|Gruda]]'s defiance against the treaty of Berlin that gave them to Montenegro put the two communities in the spotlight of international politics. In 1911, in the [[battle of De\u00e7iq]] against the Ottomans, [[Ded Gjo Luli]], leader of Hoti raised the Albanian flag for the first time since the Ottoman takeover of the country in the 15th century. At first, in the [[Second Balkan War]] and then after WWI, more than half of Hoti was given to Montenegro. Today, it is divided between the municipalities of [[Mal\u00ebsi e Madhe]] and [[Tuzi Municipality|Tuzi]].\n\nHoti is almost entirely Catholic and a few families are Muslim. Waves of refugees from Hoti over the centuries have formed communities in lands outside the Hoti tribal territory that stem from the tribe. Nowadays, many emigrants from Hoti have settled in the USA.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Corso delli fiumi Drino, e Boiana nella Dalmatia - Coronelli Vincenzo - 1688.jpg|thumb|300px|''Lago Hotti'' (Lake of Hoti), ''Traboini'' and ''Rapcia'' (Rrapsha) in 1688 by Venetian cartographer, Vincenzo Coronelli]]\n\nThe Hoti region lays along the Albania\u2013Montenegro border (Han i Hotit) in the north-eastern part of [[Lake Skadar]], called ''Liqeni i Hotit'' (Lake of Hoti). In terms of historical territory, Hoti borders [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]] to the east, [[Triepshi (tribe)|Triepshi]] to the north-east and [[Gruda (tribe)|Gruda]] to the north. Those who live in or trace their origin back to Hoti are called ''Hotjan\u00eb''. In Albania, the settlements of the region and the historical tribe are [[Rrapsh\u00eb]], [[Brigj\u00eb]], Dacaj, [[Daj\u00e7, Shkod\u00ebr|Daj\u00e7]], Firkuqe, Goca, Gryk\u00eb, Kol\u00e7ekaj, De\u00e7kaj, Lecaj, Lulashpepaj, Peperan, Stare, Shegz\u00eb  and [[Hot, Albania|Hot]]. In Montenegro, they are Drume, Traboin (including Old Traboin), [[Arza, Montenegro|Arza]] , [[Helmnica]], Shkall\u00eb, Pr\u00ebkaj, Skorraq, Spi, Vuksanlekaj, Vatnikaj, Nikgjonaj, [[Hamala, Montenegro|Hamala]], Bozhaj, Bardhaj, N\u00e2rhelm, Dreshaj, [[Vitoja]], Sukruq.

Occasionally, people from Hoti settled in neighbouring tribal regions and formed there new brotherhoods like the ''Hotovi\u0107'' of [[Piperi (tribe)|Piperi]]. Families from Hoti also lived in [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]], [[Podgorica]] and [[Kola\u0161in]].\n\nFurther east, near [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]], there is a settlement of the tribe, ''Hoti i Vendit'' or ''Hoti i Kujit''.<ref name=\"1a\">{{cite journal |last1=Ahmetaj |first1=Mehmet |title=TOPONYMY OF HOTI |journal= Studime Albanologjike |date=2007 |volume=37 |page=170 |url=https://www.ceeol.com/search/previewpdf?id=144424 |accessdate=27 January 2020 |ref=1a}}</ref> The Gjokaj brotherhood from ''Hoti i Vendit'' founded Dosu\u0111e (Dosugja) in [[Gusinje]] in the 18th century.

Since then, analysis of recorded historical material, linguistics and comparative anthropology have provided more historically-grounded accounts.\n\n[[Johann Georg von Hahn]] recorded one of the first such oral traditions from a Catholic priest named Gabriel in Shkodra in 1850.

After living in Triepshi territory, ''Geg Lazri'' moved on southwards to where the Hoti region stands.

In the same tradition, other northern Albanian and Montenegrin tribes are presented as linked by ancestral ties. A similar story has been collected in the area of Vasojevi\u0107i, where their direct ancestor was recorded as brother of a Pipo (Piperi), Ozro (Ozrini\u0107i), Krasno (Krasniqi) and Otto (Hoti), who all fled from [[Herzegovina]]. The name of the first ancestor, ''Keq'', which means ''bad'' in Albanian, is given in [[Mal\u00ebsia]] to only children or to children from families with very few children (due to infant mortality).

As Hoti was a ''fis'' (tribe) of the same patrilineal ancestry, it did not intermarry within the tribe. The two tribes with whom Hoti regularly intermarried were [[Kastrati (tribe)|Kastrati]] and the Bekaj brotherhoods of Triesh that did not have ''Ban Keqi'' as an ancestor. In the same story, the [[Gruda (tribe)|Gruda]] tribe predated the Hoti as a settled community.<ref name=\"Durham\"/> The ''old man'' (Marash Uci) who recounted the story, did not know the date of the settlement of Hoti, but described it as ''after the building of the church of [[Gruda (tribe)|Gruda]]'', which Durham matched to the year 1528. This ''Gheg Lazar'' was brother to Piper, Vaso, and Krasni, the ancestors of Piperi, Vasojevi\u0107i and [[Krasniq]]i. \n\nDurham related this southwards migration tale found in oral traditions of many Albanian and Montenegrin tribes to the [[Ottoman conquest of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Ottoman conquest of Bosnia]] in 1463. In her hypothesis, 1463 as the year of the beginning of migration could explain 1528 as a year of final settlement<ref name=\"Durham\"/> A few years after Durham's account, [[Konstantin Jire\u010dek]]'s research in Venetian state archives revealed that ''montanea Ottanorum'' (mountains of Hoti) appeared much earlier in 1474 in the area than the date of the arrival of ''Geg Lazri'' in the oral stories.<ref name=\"Durham28\"/> Later research would provide a definite date about the earliest information about Hoti in their present location in 1414 and more details in the cadastre of Venetian Shkodra in 1416-1417. This fact, Durham acknowledges in her 1928 ''Some tribal origins, laws, and customs of the Balkans'' and notes that the ''Anas must have been numerous''.<ref name=\"Durham28\">{{cite book |last1=Durham |first1=Edith |title=Some tribal origins, laws and customs of the Balkans |date=1928 |pages=20-21 |url=http://ostdok.de/id/BV020418531/ft/bsb00104125?page=30 |accessdate=28 January 2020 |ref=Durham28}}</ref>\n\n[[Milan \u0160ufflay]], who assisted Jire\u010dek's research, in his seminal ''Srbi i Arbanasi'' (Serbs and Albanians) in 1925 moved research even further from oral accounts and their interpretations towards a comparative approach with historical data. The toponym ''Hotina Gora'' (mountains of Hoti) in the Plav and Gusinje regions on the [[Lim (river)|Lim]] river basin in 1330 is the first mention of the Hoti name in historical records in the chrysobulls of De\u010dani.<ref name=\"1a\"/><ref name=\"Sufflay\"/> \u0160ufflay considers this region as the original area of settlement of Hoti from which they moved southwards.<ref name=\"1a\"/><ref name=\"Sufflay\">{{cite book |last1=\u0160ufflay |first1=Milan |title=Srbi i Arbanasi: njihova simbioza u srednjem vijeku |date=1925 |publisher=Izdanje seminara za arbanasku filologiju |page=60-61 |url=https://archive.org/details/SrbiIArbanasi |accessdate=28 January 2020 |ref=Sufflay}}</ref> At the same period, other Albanologists like [[Ernesto Cozzi]] and [[Giuseppe Valentini (albanologist)|Zef Valentini]] who studied the Albanian tribal structure moved to the same general conclusion.<ref name=\"kisha1\"/> The archival records also explain the ''coming from the north'' details of the stories and the links with such territories.<ref name=\"kisha1\">{{cite web |last1=Ukgjini |first1=Nik\u00eb |title=Kisha e Hotit [The Church of Hoti] |url=https://www.kishakatolikeshkoder.com/media/1259/shtator-tetor-2015.pdf |publisher=[[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Shkod\u00ebr-Pult]] |accessdate=28 January 2020 |ref=kisha1}}</ref> Indeed, Albanian pastoral communities from the Plav area used to move their herds in Bosnia during the winter months and then move back in the spring and summer months to their natural grazing lands.<ref name=\"Ajeti\">{{cite book |last1=Ajeti |first1=Idriz |title=Studime p\u00ebr gjuh\u00ebn shqipe [Studies on the Albanian language] |date=2017 |publisher=Academy of Sciences of Kosovo |pages=61 |url=http://www.ashak.org/repository/docs/StudimeGjuhaShqipeIdrizAjeti_804438.pdf |accessdate=26 February 2020 |ref=Ajeti}}</ref>  \n\nLater full translations of Ottoman defters also showed that despite chronological discrepancies and other errors, oral folk tradition was indeed based on actual historical figures. For example, in 1974 Selami Pulaha who translated from Ottoman Turkish and published the defter of the [[Sanjak of Scutari]] of 1485, found that in the [[nahiya]] (community) of Ku\u00e7i (which included Trieshi), the settlement of Bankeq is found and in the nahiya of Hoti, the settlement of ''Geg'' with a ''Stanash Keqi'' at its head.<ref name=\"Pulaha\">{{cite book |last1=Pulaha |first1=Selami |title=Defter i Sanxhakut t\u00eb Shkodr\u00ebs 1485 |date=1974 |publisher=Academy of Sciences of Albania |page=124 |url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B3ma9plMXxAEZi1PZTVXMXV1NFE/edit |accessdate=28 January 2020 |ref=Pulaha}}</ref> These toponyms reflect the tradition of ''Ban Keqi'', who was the founder of the Trieshi tribe and that of ''Geg Lazri'', direct ancestor of the tribe. \n\nFurther analysis of population data and historical records have shown that while the Hoti lived by the early 15th century in their present area, the Hoti as a territorial-tribal unit of the same settlement area as today, would consolidate in the mid-to-late 15th century. For example, in 1455 settlements that later were part of the Hoti tribe appear in Venetian records as distinct from them, a fact reflected in the oral tradition about the ''Anas''. As in this area, pastoral mountainous communities (''katund'') like Hoti retained their territorial cohesion throughout this period of continuous warfare, they came to absorb sedentary communities.<ref name=\"Pulaha2\">{{cite journal |last1=Pulaha |first1=Selami |title=Kontribut p\u00ebr studimin e ngulitjes s\u00eb katuneve dhe krijimin e fiseve n\u00eb Shqipe \u0308rine \u0308 e veriut shekujt XV-XVI' [Contribution to the Study of Village Settlements and the Formation of the Tribes of Northern Albania in the 15th century] |journal=Studime Historike |date=1975 |volume=12 |page=101 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q4khAQAAMAAJ |accessdate=30 January 2020 |ref=Pulaha2}}</ref> Venetian documents about the [[pronoia]] (grant) that the Hoti tribe was given over a few villages in the [[Shkodra]] area provide some more information about the early stages of this process.

These penalties had to do with damage caused by Hoti raids ''in past times when they were subjects to Lord [[Bal\u0161a III]]''.<ref name=\"Buda\"/> Hoti in return would provide Venetian campaigns with 300 troops, 80 of whom would be light cavalry.<ref name=\"Fine\">{{citation | first = John Van Antwerp | last = Fine |title = The Late Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Late Twelfth Century to the Ottoman Conquest | publisher = University of Michigan Press | year = 1994 |page=515|quote= |isbn = 978-0-472-08260-5 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LvVbRrH1QBgC&pg=PA515 }}</ref> \n\nThe enmity between Hoti and Bal\u0161a III existed since at least 1414 when documents show him as requesting from Venice the extradition of two Hoti leaders who ''harmed his lands'' even though they were nominally his vassals. The Venetial administration of Scutari considering a possible raid by Hoti in their lands and the prospect of alliance with them did not accept his request. Bal\u0161a as an act of retaliation against Venice burned down the vineyard village of [[Kalldrun]] in December 1415. The latest phase of enmity between Hoti and Bal\u0161a began after he passed judgment against Hoti in a dispute with the [[Mataguzi (tribe)|Mataguzi]] tribe over pasture lands. Despite Bal\u0161a's support to Matagu\u017ei, Hoti took over the disputed lands and Matagu\u017ei retaliated by killing four Hoti tribesmen.<ref name=\"Fine\"/> As Bal\u0161a III again sided with Matagu\u017ei and did not call for punishment for the murders, Hoti switched fealty to Venice in return for their support. As Hoti was only nominally under Bal\u0161a III in a border region between him and Venice, this influenced the balance of power and was also one of the events that preluded the [[Second Scutari War]] two years later.<ref name=\"Fine\"/> From these events until 1479 when the Ottoman era began in that region, Hoti was allied to Venice.\n\n===Early Ottoman===\n[[File:Dulcingo_Pinargenti_1573.jpg|thumb|300px|Hoti was crucial in the defense of \u00dclg\u00fcn against Venice.]]\n\nThe Ottoman era was followed by the territorial re-organization of the region into the [[sanjak of Scutari]]. Hoti was made into the ''nahiya of the mountains of Hoti'', which had 10 settlements (Geg, Tihomir, Mihalina, Ibthosh, Vidagi, Ishbisha, Lubica, Pobrezhan, Bozhan, Oblana) with 195 households in total in the defter of 1485.<ref name=\"Pulaha\"/> The actual number of households may be higher as the people from two villages (Ibthosh, Oblana) hid in the mountainous terrain to avoid registration and one village (Ishbisha) appeared to be abandoned altogether. Villages like Podgora that were given as [[pronoia]] to Hoti in Venetian times had reverted to their old administrative divisions. One hundred years later in the defter of 1582, some villages would be abandoned and re-appear under other names like Oblana which did not exist anymore in 1582; instead in its place Traboin had emerged.<ref name=\"Pulaha2\"/>\n\nThe defter of 1485 of Scutari also gives crucial information about the relations with the central Ottoman authorities. The tribal structure of communities like Hoti signified underdeveloped feudal relations of property ownership and also the existence of a close-circuit natural economy.  In this framework, the resistance of these communities to pay taxes according to the new timar system forced the Ottomans to accept their settlement as communal entities outside the timar registers. Hoti was excempted from the timar system of  land allocation in the early Ottoman Empire and no [[Sipahi|timar holders]] (''timarli sipahi'') are found in nahiya of Hoti as communal property organization remained unaffected.<ref name=\"Kola\">{{cite journal |last1=Kola |first1=Azeta |title=FROM SERENISSIMA\u2019S CENTRALIZATION TO THE SELFREGULATING KANUN: THE STRENGTHENING OF BLOOD TIES AND THE RISE OF GREAT TRIBES IN NORTHERN ALBANIA FROM 15TH TO 17TH CENTURY |journal=Acta Histriae |date=2017 |volume=25 |pages=361-362 |doi=10.19233/AH.2017.18 |url=https://zdjp.si/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/AH_25-2017-2_KOLA.pdf |accessdate=1 February 2020 |ref=Kola}}</ref> Hoti was also excempted from all extraordinary taxes to the new central authorities.

As Catholics, despite tax excemptions Hoti was also still subject to [[jizya]] and this was a further cause of resentment. This was the background for papal missions in the region to boost Catholic ecclesiastical organization against the pressure of islamization. Its military and political counterpart were the meetings of tribes in northern Albania and Montenergo in order to discuss cooperation against the Ottomans under the banner of one of the Catholic powers. One such meeting was held in July 15, 1614 in [[Ku\u010di]], where that tribe, Hoti, Kelmendi and others decided to ask papal aid against the Ottomans as was reported by the patrician of [[Kotor]], Francesco Bolizza.<ref name=\"Rizaj\">{{cite book |last1=Rizaj |first1=Sk\u00ebnder |title=Kosova gjat\u00eb shekujve XV, XVI dhe XVII: administrimi, ekonomia, shoq\u00ebria dhe l\u00ebvizja popullore |date=1982 |publisher=Rilindja |page=490 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6O0JAQAAIAAJ |accessdate=3 February 2020 |ref=Rizaj}}</ref><ref name=\"Ergo47\">{{cite book|last=Ergo|first=Dritan|chapter=Islam in the Albanian lands (XVth-XVIIth Century)|editor1-last=Schmitt|editor1-first=Oliver Jens|title=Religion und Kultur im albanischsprachigen S\u00fcdosteuropa &#91;Religion and culture in Albanian-speaking southeastern Europe&#93;|year=2010|location=Frankfurt am Main|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9783631602959|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aCdYHU9PtiIC&pg=PA47|page=47|ref=harv}}</ref> A few months earlier, his brother [[Mariano Bolizza]] traveled through the [[Sanjak of Scutari]] and compiled a report according to which, Hoti (''Hotti'') had 212 households and 600 men-in-arms, commanded by Marash Papa (''Maras Pappa'') and Rrapsha, 80 households and 212 men-in-arms commanded by Prenk Kastrati (''Prenc Castrat'').<ref name=\"3a\">{{cite web |last1=Bolizza |first1=Mariano |title=Report and Description of the Sanjak of Shkodra |url=http://www.albanianhistory.net/1614_Bolizza/index.html |accessdate=28 January 2020 |ref=harv}}</ref> \n\nOther assemblies like this one were held from 1620s to the 1650s, in the culmination of the [[Cretan War (1645\u20131669)|Cretan War]].

The status of the ''bajrak'' meant that a tribal leader was designated as ''bajraktar'' (flag-bearer) by the Ottoman state and was responsible for rallying and leading men-in-arms from the tribe in campaigns of the Ottoman army. The bajraktar of Hoti, who was recognised as the first bajraktar of Mal\u00ebsia, led the forces of tribes (Kelmendi, Shkreli, Kastrati, Gruda and three smaller tribes) in times of war mobilisation.<ref name=\"Gawrych31\"/> The event which made Hoti a ''bajrak'' was the decisive role of the 300 fighters from the tribe in the successful defense of [[Ulcinj|\u00dclg\u00fcn]] (Ulcinj/Ulqin). Luc Gjoni Jun\u00e7aj, until then voivoide, was offered the position of bajraktar on the condition that he converted to Islam. An assembly of all of Hoti, decided that his son Nik\u00eb Luca Gjoni (also called Ujk Luca) would convert on the condition that all men of Hoti, who were detained in [[Anatolia]] would be released, special taxes would be removed and all men from Mal\u00ebsia would not be conscripted to fight in wars outside of Albanian territory.<ref name=\"Lucgjonaj\">{{cite web |last1=Lucgjonaj |first1=Mark |title=DINASTIA E FAMILJES S\u00cb LUCGJONAJVE, VOJVOD\u00cbVE DHE BAJRAKTAR\u00cbVE T\u00cb HOTIT DHE MAL\u00cbSIS\u00cb |url=http://www.kallnori.org/2019/12/30/dinastia-e-familjes-se-lucgjonajve-vojvodeve-dhe-bajraktareve-te-hotit-dhe-malesise/ |website=Kallnori |publisher=Kallnori |accessdate=3 February 2020 |ref=Lucgjonaj}}</ref> Thus, Nik\u00eb Luca became Mehmet Luca Gjoni, while his brother Vuj Luca remained Catholic. The new brotherhood that was formed as an offshoot of Jun\u00e7aj, became the only partly Muslim brotherhood of Hoti, the Lucgjonaj. [[\u00c7un Mula]], bajraktar of Hoti in the 19th century, was a direct descendant of Mehmet Luca.<ref name=\"Lucgjonaj\"/> \n\nAs the conversion was political in nature, the Muslim bajraktars of Hoti kept the traditional religious obligations of the heads of Hoti and took part in the Catholic [[mass (liturgy)|mass]] in honour of Saint John the Baptist on August 29 and funded the feast that followed the religious rites.<ref name=\"kisha1\"/> In 1738, Hoti was also given as a hereditary office, the title of the [[boluk-bashi]] of Hoti in the sanjak of Scutari. This meant that the Ottoman army representative in the area of Hoti would be from the tribe itself. In the era of the [[Pashalik of Shkodra]], he became the head of these captains of all Mal\u00ebsia and was called ''bylykbash i pes\u00eb maleve'' (the boluk-bashi of the five mountains).\n\nFrom the Ottoman perspective, the institution of the bajrak had multiple benefits. Although it recognized a semi-autonomous status in communities like Hoti, it could also be used to stabilize the borderlands as these communities in their new capacity would defend the borders of the empire, as they saw in them the borders of their own territory. Furthermore, the Ottomans considered the office of head bajraktar as a means that in times of rebellion could be used to divide and conquer the tribes by handing out privileges to a select few.<ref name=\"Galaty\"/> On the other hand, autonomy of the borderlands was also a source of conflict as the tribes tried to increase their autonomy and minimize involvement of the Ottoman state. Through a circular series of events of conflict and renegotiation a state of balance was found between Ottoman centralization and tribal autonomy. Hence, the Ottoman era is marked by both continuous conflict and a formalization of socio-economic status within Ottoman administration.<ref name=\"Galaty\"/>\n\nThe 18th century also saw the formation of communities that traced their origin to Hoti in the [[Sand\u017eak]] region. The Hoti of Sand\u017eak came to that region either from Plav-Gusinje or from Kola\u0161in. After 1730, they formed the first compact communities of Hoti brotherhoods (''vllazni'') in [[Tutin]] in the villages Bujkovi\u0107i, \u0160piljani, Crni\u0161, Paljevo, Kova\u010di, Radohovci and in [[Sjenica]] in the villages Aliverovi\u0107i and Ra\u017edagina.\n\n=== Late Ottoman ===\n[[File:Albania1911.jpg|thumb|Mal\u00ebsia in the uprising of 1911]]\n\nThe disintegration of the Ottoman Empire in the long 19th century saw the rise of the Balkan states. The establishment of the [[Principality of Montenegro]] and its goal of southwards expansion threatened the borderland autonomy of Hoti, which Montenegro sought to bring under its control. The interests of Great Powers (mainly Russia, Austria-Hungary, Italy) in the region further complicated the situation. These events collectively called \"[[Great Eastern Crisis]]\" led to the [[Congress of Berlin]] that was finalized in the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]]. Various scenarios in which highland territory was given to Montenegro were being discussed as the Ottoman Empire and Montenegro were preparing to sign the recognition of Montenegro's independence and enlarged borders. In April 1880, Italy suggested that the Ottoman Empire give Montenegro the Tuz district with its Catholic Gruda and Hoti populations that would have left the tribes split between both countries.<ref name=\"Gawrych62\"/> The [[League of Prizren]] was created to defend Albanian territory from annexation. Hoti was represented in the league by its bajraktar, [[\u00c7un Mula]] and [[Ded Gjo Luli]], its foremost military leader. At that time, in the last decades of the 19th century in reports of the era Hoti's population stands at about 4,000 to 4,500 with 400-500 households. \n\nThe Ottoman state in order to avoid internal rebellion in the region at the prospect of annexation, erased all debts in the region and redistributed . The first area that was designated to be ceded was [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]] and [[Gusinje]] but after the [[Battle of Nov\u0161i\u0107e]] in December 1879, where Montenegro was defeated, the area was excluded. The next area that was being discussed already in September 1879 was that of the upper Cem valley ([[Triesh]] and [[Koja e Ku\u00e7it]] regions), all of Gruda (including [[Tuzi]]), a part of Hoti and a part of [[Vermosh]].<ref name=\"Verli1\">{{cite journal |last1=Verli |first1=Marenglen |title=The role of Hoti in the uprising of the Great Highlands |journal=Studime Historike |date=2014 |issue=1-2 |pages=54-55, 63-64, 71 |url=https://www.ceeol.com/search/viewpdf?id=463929 |accessdate=5 February 2020 |ref=Verli1}}</ref> In relation to Hoti this would have left an additional problem of tensions and instability due to the tribe having precedence by tradition over the other four tribes during peace and war.<ref name=\"Gawrych62\"/> In January 1880 it was decided that this area would be annexed by Montenegro and the agreement was ratified on April 18, 1880. Preparations were already being made by the highland tribes. In March, Hoti, Gruda, Kelmendi and Kastrati proclaimed that the annexation would be stopped and started gathering forces near the border. The tribes had committeed to a [[Besa (Albanian culture)|besa]] (pledge) to resist any reduction of their lands and sent telegrams to surrounding regions for military assistance.<ref name=\"Gawrych62\">{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=62.}}</ref>\n\nOn April 22, defensive lines were formed in Tuzi against the Montenegrin annexation that was about to happen the following day. Of the 400 initial defenders of Tuzi, many were from Hoti.<ref name=\"Verli1\"/> In the coming days, this grew to 12,000 as volunteers from the [[League of Prizren]] came to the defense line. Of the 6,800 that were in the defensive position of Helm, 500 were from Hoti. These events stopped the anexation of Hoti, although Triesh was handed to Montenegro. The border area remained vague and a conflict zone in the years that followed. In May a new agreement was signed and the main target of Montenegrin annexation became [[Ulcinj]] as the plan for Hoti and Gruda failed. To help the defenders of Ulcinj, Hoti and Gruda decided to attack Montenegrin positions and captured [[Matagu\u017ei]] on July 12, but lost control over it eleven days later.<ref name=\"Verli1\"/> The Ottoman army finally took over Ulcinj and handed it to Montenegro on November 22.\n\nIn 1881-2, Hoti and Gruda planned an attack against Montenegro and carried raids past the border with Ku\u010di. The situation was very unstable in the area as the Ottomans tried to re-establish their administration. In May 1883, 3000 highlanders rose in rebellion against the Ottoman state. A new ''besa'' (pledge) had been agreed by Hoti, Gruda, Kastrati and Shkreli to stop the delimitation of Ottoman-Montenegrin border.<ref name=\"Miller\">{{cite book |last1=Miller |first1=William |title=The Ottoman empire and its successors, 1801-1927 |date=1966 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0714619744 |page=406 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hj8sBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA406 |accessdate=7 February 2020 |ref=Miller}}</ref> Ottoman front Austria-Hungary intervened for an armistice to be signed. Then, a punitive expedition was carried out in the Hoti, Gruda and Kastrati regions by the Ottomans under Hafiz Pasha in June 10.  After gaining control in June 25, the Ottomans razed Hoti.<ref name=\"Verli1\"/> [[Ded Gjo Luli]] of Hoti, [[Smajl Martini Ivezaj|Smajl Martini]] of Gruda and Dod Pre\u00e7i of Kastrati did not surrender and hid in the mountains as fugitives. In a smaller scale, skirmishes and clashes continued well into the 1890s.\n\nThe [[Young Turk Revolution]] in 1908 and subsequent restoration of the [[Ottoman constitution of 1876|Ottoman constitution]] provided new hopes for minorities about the upholding of their national rights. Like many other tribes, Hoti made a besa (pledge) to support the constitution and halt [[Gjakmarrja|blood feuding]] until November 6, 1908.<ref name=\"Gawrych159\">{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=159.}}</ref> Despite initial high promises, constitutional rights were never implemented as was hoped and repression towards minorities soon became a central policy of the Young Turks. In Kosovo, hopes rose again with the outbreak of [[Albanian revolt of 1910|a revolt in 1910]], but it was defeated. This was followed by the ban on Albanian education, arrests and exile of Albanian nationalists and a campaign to disarm the highlanders of Mal\u00ebsia. In the meantime, the highland tribes were in communication with [[Nicholas I of Montenegro]], who was willing to allow them to enter Montenegro and provide some cover support against the Ottomans in order to exploit the situation for his own ends.<ref name=\"Treadway\"/> \n\nAnd so, by the end of 1910, about 2,500 people had found refuge in the area around [[Podgorica]]. The Great Powers chose a conciliatory policy and were against a new Albanian revolt. As Nicholas made more and more open statements about annexation under Montenegro and was also called upon by the Great Powers to remain neutral and not risk a general war, the rebels chose to move forwards and start the attack on March 24, 1911. [[Ded Gjo Luli]] at the head of 15-20 men of Hoti and 200-300 from Kelmendi captured the Ottoman outpost in [[Grabom]] and so began the [[Albanian revolt of 1911|Highlanders' Revolt]]. Until 30 March, ten outposts in Hoti, Gruda and Kelmendi fell and on that day the rebels, who numbered a total force of 2,200, got [[Tuzi]]. Hoti men were about 400 of the total and were under [[Ded Gjo Luli]], who came to the forefront as the general leader of the revolt. That day a memorandum, which was sent to the embassies of the Great Power in [[Cetinje]] was drafted by Ded Gjo Luli, [[Sokol Baci]], [[Isa Boletini]] and others. The memorandum put forward the demand for the autonomy and self-government for the Albanian vilayets.<ref name=\"Verli1\"/>\n\nThe battles raged on in the line from [[Dinosha]] to De\u00e7iq, where the [[Battle of De\u00e7iq|battle that took place in April 6]] is the most reported battefield activity of the revolt. Seven rebels from [[Koja e Ku\u00e7it|Koja]] and thirty Ottomans died in the battle but it became known because after victory was secured, Ded Gjo Luli raised the Albanian standard on the peak of Bratila. The flag hadn't been raised since the 15th century and [[Skanderbeg]]'s defense against the Ottomans. The phrase ''Tash o vllaz\u00ebn do t\u2019ju takoj\u00eb t\u00eb shihni at\u00eb q\u00eb p\u00ebr 450 vjet se ka pa kush'' (Now brothers you have earned the right to see that which has been unseen for 450 years) has been attributed to Ded Gjo Luli by later memoirs of those who were present when he raised the flag.<ref name=\"Verli1\"/> The Ottoman response came throughout April and Tuzi was retaken and many villages were burnt by [[Shevket Turgut Pasha]] and martial law was declared. In May 14, the Ottomans started a new attack with 10,000 men in the Dinosha-Tuzi-De\u00e7iq line defended by 2,000 highlanders.

The five-month [[Siege of Scutari (1912\u201313)|Siege of Scutari]] was the focal point of the campaign. The city was surrendered after an agreement by [[Essad Pasha Toptani]] and Nicholas I, but the Montenegrin army had suffered 15,000 losses. The long resistance also meant that Montenegrin claims in the region were hampered. The final status of the city was to remain in the new Albanian state in the ensuing [[Treaty of London (1913)|treaty of London]] in May 1913. By the terms of the treaty, Hoti was to remain entirely within Albania. In June, the second Balkan war broke out. With the defeat of Bulgaria, the victors, including Montenegro, increased their borders and more than half of Hoti was given to Montenegro, as was all of Gruda by the terms of the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|treaty of Bucharest]] in August 1913. Still, the region remained in turmoil and Montenegrin actual control was not established as clashes broke out in the borderlands. Then, the Serbian army intervened and occupied the area. After further intervention from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Serbian army withdrew.

Albania itself was falling under Italy's sphere of influence and Italy was presenting itself as the champion of Albanian national rights. In this political context, documents from the British [[Foreign Office]] describe a situation where, ''from Hoti and Grude in what used to be Montenegro, right along the Yugoslav frontier down to Dibra and Ochrida, no inconsiderable area and population await the crusade of an Albanian or Italian Liberator.''.<ref name=\"GB\">{{cite book |title=Documents on British Foreign Policy, 1919-1939 |date=1971 |publisher=Great Britain.

Border regions like Hoti suffered in particular as family members became isolated from one another. In the 1990s, the collapse of the economy led to heavy migration throughout Hoti, Gruda and the northern highlands as was happening throughout the Balkans.\n\n==Traditions==\n[[File:Woman of the Hoti tribe, September 1908.jpg|thumb|300px|Traditional female dress of Hoti, 1908]]\n\nHoti is almost entirely Catholic. Its oldest church is in ruins and dates to around 1500.<ref name=\"kisha1\" /> Hoti was divided in two parishes: one in Rrapsh\u00eb and the other in Traboin. The church of Rrapsh\u00eb is the locality of Brigje (''kisha e Brigjes''). Francesco Bolizza recorded in 1616 when he was writing a report about the region. [[Pjet\u00ebr Bogdani]] in 1672 notes that in Brigje besides the church, there was also a school in function. Rrapsh\u00eb first became a parish in 1699, when the Franciscan Order settled in Hoti. One of the many franciscans, who served in the church of Brigje was Fra [[Gjergj Fishta]] in 1902.\n\nThe parish and church of Traboin first date to 1648 , but the church was later ruined and rebuilt. In 1696, Hoti gained ''bajrak'' status and other rights on the condition that one of its leaders converts to Islam. From that point, the bajraktar of Hoti is Muslim and those families that today are Muslim descend from this original conversion. Thus, in the late Ottoman period, the tribe of Hoti consisted of 500 Catholic households and 23 Muslim that included the family of the bajraktar.<ref name=\"Gawrych31\">{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=31.}}</ref> This conversion did not affect relations within the community as although Muslim, the bajraktar followed the traditions of the tribe. He annually funded the feast of St. John the Baptist ({{lang-sq|Sh\u00ebn Gjoni}} or ''Shnjoni''), the patron saint of Hoti, and observed mass on that day. \n\nThe funerary customs of Hoti as those of Mal\u00ebsia in general include the lamentation (''[[gjam\u00eb]]'') of the deceased in a collective manner by a group of men (''gjamatar\u00eb'').<ref name=\"gjura\">{{cite web |last1=Gjurav\u00e7aj |first1=Pjet\u00ebr |title=Vajtimet e grave dhe gjam\u00ebt e burrave n\u00eb Mal\u00ebsin\u00eb e Madhe - Hot, Grud\u00eb, Triepsh dhe Koj\u00eb ( 7) [Lamentation of men and women in Mal\u00ebsia - Hoti, Gruda, Triepshi, Koja |url=http://www.buzuku.info/Arkivi/Buzuku09/Let%C3%ABrsi_popullore.htm |website=Buzuku |publisher=Buzuku Magazine |accessdate=10 February 2020 |ref=gjura}}</ref>\n\n\n== Brotherhoods ==\nAll families (''barqe'') of Hoti belong to brotherhoods who are descended from the four sons of Geg Laz\u00ebr Keqi: Pjet\u00ebr, Jun\u00e7, Gjon, Laj\u00e7.\nIn addition to using the names of brotherhoods or that of the oldest known ancestor as surnames, individual families may also have a patronymic surname taken from a more recent ancestor or the village of origin.<ref name=\"Smajlaj\"/> From Pjet\u00ebr Gega, founder of Traboin, trace their descent: Goj\u00e7aj, Dedvukaj, Lekvukaj, Camaj, Gjok\u00eb-Camaj, Dushaj, Dakaj.

Hoti and Gruda on the far left side.]]\n'''Hoti''' is a historical [[Tribes of Albania|Albanian tribe]] (''klan'') and sub-region of [[Mal\u00ebsia]], a divided area located in northern [[Albania]] and southern [[Montenegro]]. Its geography is mostly mountainous, but some of its villages are on flat terrain near the banks of Lake Skadar.\n\nHoti was mentioned for the first time in 1330 and fully formed as a community in the mid-to-late 15th century. In its long history, Hoti played an important role in regional politics as a leading community in the northern Albanian tribal structure and as a semi-autonomous area in the borderlands between the Ottoman and Austrian empires and later Montenegro. In 1879, Hoti and [[Gruda (tribe)|Gruda]]'s defiance against the treaty of Berlin that gave them to Montenegro put the two communities in the spotlight of international politics. In 1911, in the [[battle of De\u00e7iq]] against the Ottomans, [[Ded Gjo Luli]], leader of Hoti raised the Albanian flag for the first time since the Ottoman takeover of the country in the 15th century. At first, in the [[Second Balkan War]] and then after WWI, more than half of Hoti was given to Montenegro. Today, it is divided between the municipalities of [[Mal\u00ebsi e Madhe]] and [[Tuzi Municipality|Tuzi]].\n\nHoti is almost entirely Catholic and a few families are Muslim. Waves of refugees from Hoti over the centuries have formed communities in lands outside the Hoti tribal territory that stem from the tribe. Nowadays, many emigrants from Hoti have settled in the USA.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Corso delli fiumi Drino, e Boiana nella Dalmatia - Coronelli Vincenzo - 1688.jpg|thumb|300px|''Lago Hotti'' (Lake of Hoti), ''Traboini'' and ''Rapcia'' (Rrapsha) in 1688 by Venetian cartographer, Vincenzo Coronelli]]\n\nThe Hoti region lays along the Albania\u2013Montenegro border (Han i Hotit) in the north-eastern part of [[Lake Skadar]], called ''Liqeni i Hotit'' (Lake of Hoti). In terms of historical territory, Hoti borders [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]] to the east, [[Triepshi (tribe)|Triepshi]] to the north-east and [[Gruda (tribe)|Gruda]] to the north. Those who live in or trace their origin back to Hoti are called ''Hotjan\u00eb''. In Albania, the settlements of the region and the historical tribe are [[Rrapsh\u00eb]], [[Brigj\u00eb]], Dacaj, [[Daj\u00e7, Shkod\u00ebr|Daj\u00e7]], Firkuqe, Goca, Gryk\u00eb, Kol\u00e7ekaj, De\u00e7kaj, Lecaj, Lulashpepaj, Peperan, Stare, Shegz\u00eb  and [[Hot, Albania|Hot]].

The two tribes with whom Hoti regularly intermarried were [[Kastrati (tribe)|Kastrati]] and the Bekaj brotherhoods of Triesh that did not have ''Ban Keqi'' as an ancestor. In the same story, the [[Gruda (tribe)|Gruda]] tribe predated the Hoti as a settled community.<ref name=\"Durham\"/> The ''old man'' (Marash Uci) who recounted the story, did not know the date of the settlement of Hoti, but described it as ''after the building of the church of [[Gruda (tribe)|Gruda]]'', which Durham matched to the year 1528. This ''Gheg Lazar'' was brother to Piper, Vaso, and Krasni, the ancestors of Piperi, Vasojevi\u0107i and [[Krasniq]]i. \n\nDurham related this southwards migration tale found in oral traditions of many Albanian and Montenegrin tribes to the [[Ottoman conquest of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Ottoman conquest of Bosnia]] in 1463.

Under Podgora as the head village in the area they also controlled the settlements of Majora, Egreshi, Vajushi, Karokjeta (alt. Feralini), Sordani, and Ljushta.

The Venetial administration of Scutari considering a possible raid by Hoti in their lands and the prospect of alliance with them did not accept his request. Bal\u0161a as an act of retaliation against Venice burned down the vineyard village of [[Kalldrun]] in December 1415. The latest phase of enmity between Hoti and Bal\u0161a began after he passed judgment against Hoti in a dispute with the [[Mataguzi (tribe)|Mataguzi]] tribe over pasture lands. Despite Bal\u0161a's support to Matagu\u017ei, Hoti took over the disputed lands and Matagu\u017ei retaliated by killing four Hoti tribesmen.<ref name=\"Fine\"/> As Bal\u0161a III again sided with Matagu\u017ei and did not call for punishment for the murders, Hoti switched fealty to Venice in return for their support. As Hoti was only nominally under Bal\u0161a III in a border region between him and Venice, this influenced the balance of power and was also one of the events that preluded the [[Second Scutari War]] two years later.<ref name=\"Fine\"/> From these events until 1479 when the Ottoman era began in that region, Hoti was allied to Venice.\n\n===Early Ottoman===\n[[File:Dulcingo_Pinargenti_1573.jpg|thumb|300px|Hoti was crucial in the defense of \u00dclg\u00fcn against Venice.]]\n\nThe Ottoman era was followed by the territorial re-organization of the region into the [[sanjak of Scutari]]. Hoti was made into the ''nahiya of the mountains of Hoti'', which had 10 settlements (Geg, Tihomir, Mihalina, Ibthosh, Vidagi, Ishbisha, Lubica, Pobrezhan, Bozhan, Oblana) with 195 households in total in the defter of 1485.<ref name=\"Pulaha\"/> The actual number of households may be higher as the people from two villages (Ibthosh, Oblana) hid in the mountainous terrain to avoid registration and one village (Ishbisha) appeared to be abandoned altogether. Villages like Podgora that were given as [[pronoia]] to Hoti in Venetian times had reverted to their old administrative divisions. One hundred years later in the defter of 1582, some villages would be abandoned and re-appear under other names like Oblana which did not exist anymore in 1582; instead in its place Traboin had emerged.<ref name=\"Pulaha2\"/>\n\nThe defter of 1485 of Scutari also gives crucial information about the relations with the central Ottoman authorities. The tribal structure of communities like Hoti signified underdeveloped feudal relations of property ownership and also the existence of a close-circuit natural economy.  In this framework, the resistance of these communities to pay taxes according to the new timar system forced the Ottomans to accept their settlement as communal entities outside the timar registers. Hoti was excempted from the timar system of  land allocation in the early Ottoman Empire and no [[Sipahi|timar holders]] (''timarli sipahi'') are found in nahiya of Hoti as communal property organization remained unaffected.<ref name=\"Kola\">{{cite journal |last1=Kola |first1=Azeta |title=FROM SERENISSIMA\u2019S CENTRALIZATION TO THE SELFREGULATING KANUN: THE STRENGTHENING OF BLOOD TIES AND THE RISE OF GREAT TRIBES IN NORTHERN ALBANIA FROM 15TH TO 17TH CENTURY |journal=Acta Histriae |date=2017 |volume=25 |pages=361-362 |doi=10.19233/AH.2017.18 |url=https://zdjp.si/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/AH_25-2017-2_KOLA.pdf |accessdate=1 February 2020 |ref=Kola}}</ref> Hoti was also excempted from all extraordinary taxes to the new central authorities.

As Catholics, despite tax excemptions Hoti was also still subject to [[jizya]] and this was a further cause of resentment. This was the background for papal missions in the region to boost Catholic ecclesiastical organization against the pressure of islamization. Its military and political counterpart were the meetings of tribes in northern Albania and Montenergo in order to discuss cooperation against the Ottomans under the banner of one of the Catholic powers. One such meeting was held in July 15, 1614 in [[Ku\u010di]], where that tribe, Hoti, Kelmendi and others decided to ask papal aid against the Ottomans as was reported by the patrician of [[Kotor]], Francesco Bolizza.<ref name=\"Rizaj\">{{cite book |last1=Rizaj |first1=Sk\u00ebnder |title=Kosova gjat\u00eb shekujve XV, XVI dhe XVII: administrimi, ekonomia, shoq\u00ebria dhe l\u00ebvizja popullore |date=1982 |publisher=Rilindja |page=490 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6O0JAQAAIAAJ |accessdate=3 February 2020 |ref=Rizaj}}</ref><ref name=\"Ergo47\">{{cite book|last=Ergo|first=Dritan|chapter=Islam in the Albanian lands (XVth-XVIIth Century)|editor1-last=Schmitt|editor1-first=Oliver Jens|title=Religion und Kultur im albanischsprachigen S\u00fcdosteuropa &#91;Religion and culture in Albanian-speaking southeastern Europe&#93;|year=2010|location=Frankfurt am Main|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9783631602959|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aCdYHU9PtiIC&pg=PA47|page=47|ref=harv}}</ref> A few months earlier, his brother [[Mariano Bolizza]] traveled through the [[Sanjak of Scutari]] and compiled a report according to which, Hoti (''Hotti'') had 212 households and 600 men-in-arms, commanded by Marash Papa (''Maras Pappa'') and Rrapsha, 80 households and 212 men-in-arms commanded by Prenk Kastrati (''Prenc Castrat'').<ref name=\"3a\">{{cite web |last1=Bolizza |first1=Mariano |title=Report and Description of the Sanjak of Shkodra |url=http://www.albanianhistory.net/1614_Bolizza/index.html |accessdate=28 January 2020 |ref=harv}}</ref> \n\nOther assemblies like this one were held from 1620s to the 1650s, in the culmination of the [[Cretan War (1645\u20131669)|Cretan War]].

The status of the ''bajrak'' meant that a tribal leader was designated as ''bajraktar'' (flag-bearer) by the Ottoman state and was responsible for rallying and leading men-in-arms from the tribe in campaigns of the Ottoman army. The bajraktar of Hoti, who was recognised as the first bajraktar of Mal\u00ebsia, led the forces of tribes (Kelmendi, Shkreli, Kastrati, Gruda and three smaller tribes) in times of war mobilisation.<ref name=\"Gawrych31\"/> The event which made Hoti a ''bajrak'' was the decisive role of the 300 fighters from the tribe in the successful defense of [[Ulcinj|\u00dclg\u00fcn]] (Ulcinj/Ulqin). Luc Gjoni Jun\u00e7aj, until then voivoide, was offered the position of bajraktar on the condition that he converted to Islam. An assembly of all of Hoti, decided that his son Nik\u00eb Luca Gjoni (also called Ujk Luca) would convert on the condition that all men of Hoti, who were detained in [[Anatolia]] would be released, special taxes would be removed and all men from Mal\u00ebsia would not be conscripted to fight in wars outside of Albanian territory.<ref name=\"Lucgjonaj\">{{cite web |last1=Lucgjonaj |first1=Mark |title=DINASTIA E FAMILJES S\u00cb LUCGJONAJVE, VOJVOD\u00cbVE DHE BAJRAKTAR\u00cbVE T\u00cb HOTIT DHE MAL\u00cbSIS\u00cb |url=http://www.kallnori.org/2019/12/30/dinastia-e-familjes-se-lucgjonajve-vojvodeve-dhe-bajraktareve-te-hotit-dhe-malesise/ |website=Kallnori |publisher=Kallnori |accessdate=3 February 2020 |ref=Lucgjonaj}}</ref> Thus, Nik\u00eb Luca became Mehmet Luca Gjoni, while his brother Vuj Luca remained Catholic. The new brotherhood that was formed as an offshoot of Jun\u00e7aj, became the only partly Muslim brotherhood of Hoti, the Lucgjonaj. [[\u00c7un Mula]], bajraktar of Hoti in the 19th century, was a direct descendant of Mehmet Luca.<ref name=\"Lucgjonaj\"/> \n\nAs the conversion was political in nature, the Muslim bajraktars of Hoti kept the traditional religious obligations of the heads of Hoti and took part in the Catholic [[mass (liturgy)|mass]] in honour of Saint John the Baptist on August 29 and funded the feast that followed the religious rites.<ref name=\"kisha1\"/> In 1738, Hoti was also given as a hereditary office, the title of the [[boluk-bashi]] of Hoti in the sanjak of Scutari. This meant that the Ottoman army representative in the area of Hoti would be from the tribe itself. In the era of the [[Pashalik of Shkodra]], he became the head of these captains of all Mal\u00ebsia and was called ''bylykbash i pes\u00eb maleve'' (the boluk-bashi of the five mountains).\n\nFrom the Ottoman perspective, the institution of the bajrak had multiple benefits. Although it recognized a semi-autonomous status in communities like Hoti, it could also be used to stabilize the borderlands as these communities in their new capacity would defend the borders of the empire, as they saw in them the borders of their own territory. Furthermore, the Ottomans considered the office of head bajraktar as a means that in times of rebellion could be used to divide and conquer the tribes by handing out privileges to a select few.<ref name=\"Galaty\"/> On the other hand, autonomy of the borderlands was also a source of conflict as the tribes tried to increase their autonomy and minimize involvement of the Ottoman state. Through a circular series of events of conflict and renegotiation a state of balance was found between Ottoman centralization and tribal autonomy. Hence, the Ottoman era is marked by both continuous conflict and a formalization of socio-economic status within Ottoman administration.<ref name=\"Galaty\"/>\n\nThe 18th century also saw the formation of communities that traced their origin to Hoti in the [[Sand\u017eak]] region. The Hoti of Sand\u017eak came to that region either from Plav-Gusinje or from Kola\u0161in. After 1730, they formed the first compact communities of Hoti brotherhoods (''vllazni'') in [[Tutin]] in the villages Bujkovi\u0107i, \u0160piljani, Crni\u0161, Paljevo, Kova\u010di, Radohovci and in [[Sjenica]] in the villages Aliverovi\u0107i and Ra\u017edagina.\n\n=== Late Ottoman ===\n[[File:Albania1911.jpg|thumb|Mal\u00ebsia in the uprising of 1911]]\n\nThe disintegration of the Ottoman Empire in the long 19th century saw the rise of the Balkan states. The establishment of the [[Principality of Montenegro]] and its goal of southwards expansion threatened the borderland autonomy of Hoti, which Montenegro sought to bring under its control. The interests of Great Powers (mainly Russia, Austria-Hungary, Italy) in the region further complicated the situation. These events collectively called \"[[Great Eastern Crisis]]\" led to the [[Congress of Berlin]] that was finalized in the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]]. Various scenarios in which highland territory was given to Montenegro were being discussed as the Ottoman Empire and Montenegro were preparing to sign the recognition of Montenegro's independence and enlarged borders. In April 1880, Italy suggested that the Ottoman Empire give Montenegro the Tuz district with its Catholic Gruda and Hoti populations that would have left the tribes split between both countries.<ref name=\"Gawrych62\"/> The [[League of Prizren]] was created to defend Albanian territory from annexation. Hoti was represented in the league by its bajraktar, [[\u00c7un Mula]] and [[Ded Gjo Luli]], its foremost military leader. At that time, in the last decades of the 19th century in reports of the era Hoti's population stands at about 4,000 to 4,500 with 400-500 households. \n\nThe Ottoman state in order to avoid internal rebellion in the region at the prospect of annexation, erased all debts in the region and redistributed . The first area that was designated to be ceded was [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]] and [[Gusinje]] but after the [[Battle of Nov\u0161i\u0107e]] in December 1879, where Montenegro was defeated, the area was excluded. The next area that was being discussed already in September 1879 was that of the upper Cem valley ([[Triesh]] and [[Koja e Ku\u00e7it]] regions), all of Gruda (including [[Tuzi]]), a part of Hoti and a part of [[Vermosh]].<ref name=\"Verli1\">{{cite journal |last1=Verli |first1=Marenglen |title=The role of Hoti in the uprising of the Great Highlands |journal=Studime Historike |date=2014 |issue=1-2 |pages=54-55, 63-64, 71 |url=https://www.ceeol.com/search/viewpdf?id=463929 |accessdate=5 February 2020 |ref=Verli1}}</ref> In relation to Hoti this would have left an additional problem of tensions and instability due to the tribe having precedence by tradition over the other four tribes during peace and war.<ref name=\"Gawrych62\"/> In January 1880 it was decided that this area would be annexed by Montenegro and the agreement was ratified on April 18, 1880. Preparations were already being made by the highland tribes. In March, Hoti, Gruda, Kelmendi and Kastrati proclaimed that the annexation would be stopped and started gathering forces near the border. The tribes had committeed to a [[Besa (Albanian culture)|besa]] (pledge) to resist any reduction of their lands and sent telegrams to surrounding regions for military assistance.<ref name=\"Gawrych62\">{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=62.}}</ref>\n\nOn April 22, defensive lines were formed in Tuzi against the Montenegrin annexation that was about to happen the following day. Of the 400 initial defenders of Tuzi, many were from Hoti.<ref name=\"Verli1\"/> In the coming days, this grew to 12,000 as volunteers from the [[League of Prizren]] came to the defense line. Of the 6,800 that were in the defensive position of Helm, 500 were from Hoti. These events stopped the anexation of Hoti, although Triesh was handed to Montenegro. The border area remained vague and a conflict zone in the years that followed. In May a new agreement was signed and the main target of Montenegrin annexation became [[Ulcinj]] as the plan for Hoti and Gruda failed. To help the defenders of Ulcinj, Hoti and Gruda decided to attack Montenegrin positions and captured [[Matagu\u017ei]] on July 12, but lost control over it eleven days later.<ref name=\"Verli1\"/> The Ottoman army finally took over Ulcinj and handed it to Montenegro on November 22.\n\nIn 1881-2, Hoti and Gruda planned an attack against Montenegro and carried raids past the border with Ku\u010di. The situation was very unstable in the area as the Ottomans tried to re-establish their administration. In May 1883, 3000 highlanders rose in rebellion against the Ottoman state.

Then, a punitive expedition was carried out in the Hoti, Gruda and Kastrati regions by the Ottomans under Hafiz Pasha in June 10.  After gaining control in June 25, the Ottomans razed Hoti.<ref name=\"Verli1\"/> [[Ded Gjo Luli]] of Hoti, [[Smajl Martini Ivezaj|Smajl Martini]] of Gruda and Dod Pre\u00e7i of Kastrati did not surrender and hid in the mountains as fugitives. In a smaller scale, skirmishes and clashes continued well into the 1890s.\n\nThe [[Young Turk Revolution]] in 1908 and subsequent restoration of the [[Ottoman constitution of 1876|Ottoman constitution]] provided new hopes for minorities about the upholding of their national rights. Like many other tribes, Hoti made a besa (pledge) to support the constitution and halt [[Gjakmarrja|blood feuding]] until November 6, 1908.<ref name=\"Gawrych159\">{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=159.}}</ref> Despite initial high promises, constitutional rights were never implemented as was hoped and repression towards minorities soon became a central policy of the Young Turks. In Kosovo, hopes rose again with the outbreak of [[Albanian revolt of 1910|a revolt in 1910]], but it was defeated. This was followed by the ban on Albanian education, arrests and exile of Albanian nationalists and a campaign to disarm the highlanders of Mal\u00ebsia. In the meantime, the highland tribes were in communication with [[Nicholas I of Montenegro]], who was willing to allow them to enter Montenegro and provide some cover support against the Ottomans in order to exploit the situation for his own ends.<ref name=\"Treadway\"/> \n\nAnd so, by the end of 1910, about 2,500 people had found refuge in the area around [[Podgorica]]. The Great Powers chose a conciliatory policy and were against a new Albanian revolt. As Nicholas made more and more open statements about annexation under Montenegro and was also called upon by the Great Powers to remain neutral and not risk a general war, the rebels chose to move forwards and start the attack on March 24, 1911. [[Ded Gjo Luli]] at the head of 15-20 men of Hoti and 200-300 from Kelmendi captured the Ottoman outpost in [[Grabom]] and so began the [[Albanian revolt of 1911|Highlanders' Revolt]]. Until 30 March, ten outposts in Hoti, Gruda and Kelmendi fell and on that day the rebels, who numbered a total force of 2,200, got [[Tuzi]]. Hoti men were about 400 of the total and were under [[Ded Gjo Luli]], who came to the forefront as the general leader of the revolt. That day a memorandum, which was sent to the embassies of the Great Power in [[Cetinje]] was drafted by Ded Gjo Luli, [[Sokol Baci]], [[Isa Boletini]] and others. The memorandum put forward the demand for the autonomy and self-government for the Albanian vilayets.<ref name=\"Verli1\"/>\n\nThe battles raged on in the line from [[Dinosha]] to De\u00e7iq, where the [[Battle of De\u00e7iq|battle that took place in April 6]] is the most report battefield activity of the revolt. Seven rebels and thirty Ottomans died in the battle but it became known because after victory was secured, Ded Gjo Luli raised the Albanian standard on the peak of Bratila. The flag hadn't been raised since the 15th century and [[Skanderbeg]]'s defense against the Ottomans. The phrase ''Tash o vllaz\u00ebn do t\u2019ju takoj\u00eb t\u00eb shihni at\u00eb q\u00eb p\u00ebr 450 vjet se ka pa kush'' (Now brothers you have earned the right to see that which has been unseen for 450 years) has been attributed to Ded Gjo Luli by later memoirs of those who were present when he raised the flag.<ref name=\"Verli1\"/> The Ottoman response came throughout April and Tuzi was retaken and many villages were burnt by [[Shevket Turgut Pasha]] and martial law was declared. In May 14, the Ottomans started a new attack with 10,000 men in the Dinosha-Tuzi-De\u00e7iq line defended by 2,000 highlanders. The defense was surrounded and retreated again towards Podgorica.<ref name=\"Treadway\">{{cite book |last1=Treadway |first1=John |title=The Falcon and the Eagle: Montenegro and Austria-Hungary, 1908-1914 |date=1983 |publisher=Purdue Univerisity Press |isbn=1557531463 |pages=70-80, 160-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JVJUk2cHkDcC&pg=PA70 |accessdate=7 February 2020 |ref=Treadway}}</ref> The Ottomans called for submission and offered amnesty and a large monetary compensation for any leader who surrendered, but this was refused. Meanwhile, the uprising had gotten international coverage and groups of volunteers were being organized to come in the region to fight. \n\nAs new fighting broke out, on 23 June 1911, the leaders of the uprising and other Albanian revolutionaries gathered near [[Selc\u00eb]] in Kelmend and drafted the [[Gre\u00e7\u00eb Memorandum]] demanding Albanian socio-political and linguistic rights.<ref name=\"Verli1\"/><ref name=\"Gawrych186187\"/> Hoti's representation included Ded Gjo Luli and Gjeto Marku and its three parish priests, Karl Prenushi (Vuksanlekaj), Sebastian Hila (Rrapsha) and Luigj Bushati (Traboin). The memorandum was refused, but a negotiation process began, which led to an eventual agreement which included general amnesty, the recognition of the right to Albanian education and the right to bear arms. In the [[nahiye]] of Hoti, this meant that for the first time the Ottoman government pledged to open and fund a primary school in Albanian.<ref name=\"Gawrych186187\">{{cite book|last=Gawrych|first=George|title=The Crescent and the Eagle: Ottoman rule, Islam and the Albanians, 1874\u20131913|year=2006|location=London|publisher=IB Tauris|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=wPOtzk-unJgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+crescent+and+the+eagle:+Ottoman+rule,+Islam+and+the+Albanians,+1874-1913+lexicon&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiT94zl8ebXAhWJT7wKHYRLADEQ6AEIJjAA#v=snippet&q=Hoti&f=false|isbn=9781845112875|pages=186-187.|ref=harv}}</ref> Schooling in Albanian until then was either offered by the priests and monks of the Catholic Church or in one of the Albanian schools that Austria-Hungary funded under the cultural protectorate over the Ottoman Empire's Catholics. The beginning of the Balkan Wars left much of the agreement unimplemented.\n\n=== Modern ===\n[[File:Balkan Wars Boundaries.jpg|thumb|300px|By the treaty of London, Hoti was included in the borders of Albania and by the treaty of Bucharest of a few months later, it was divided between Albania and Montenegro.]]\n\nIn the Balkan Wars, northern Albanian territories came under a combined Serbo-Montenegrin attack. The five-month [[Siege of Scutari (1912\u201313)|Siege of Scutari]] was the focal point of the campaign. The city was surrendered after an agreement by [[Essad Pasha Toptani]] and Nicholas I, but the Montenegrin army had suffered 15,000 losses. The long resistance also meant that Montenegrin claims in the region were hampered. The final status of the city was to remain in the new Albanian state in the ensuing [[Treaty of London (1913)|treaty of London]] in May 1913. By the terms of the treaty, Hoti was to remain entirely within Albania. In June, the second Balkan war broke out. With the defeat of Bulgaria, the victors, including Montenegro, increased their borders and more than half of Hoti was given to Montenegro, as was all of Gruda by the terms of the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|treaty of Bucharest]] in August 1913. Still, the region remained in turmoil and Montenegrin actual control was not established as clashes broke out in the borderlands. Then, the Serbian army intervened and occupied the area. After further intervention from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Serbian army withdrew. In the process, massacres of hundreds of people took place. <ref name=\"Treadway\"/> In January 1916, with the [[Montenegrin Campaign of World War I|surrender of Montenegro to Austria-Hungary in WWI]], Hoti came under Austro-Hungarian military and civilian administration until 1918. \n\nIn the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919\u20131920|Paris Peace Conference]] of 1919, the Albanian delagation at first headed by [[Turhan Pasha]] and then [[Luigj Bum\u00e7i]] presented their case for Hoti and other territories to be returned to Albania, but borders remained unchanged.<ref name=\"USDS\">{{cite book |title=The Paris Peace Conference, 1919 |date=1919 |publisher=US- Department of State |page=111 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B4wGAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA111 |accessdate=10 February 2020 |ref=USDS}}</ref> Under the new treaties, the Serbian army entered Hoti, Gruda and the northern highlands that were given to Montenegro in the treaty of Bucharest, now as part of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]].

This event was commemorated 100 years later and a monument in the village [[Hot, Albania|Hoti]] was erected by the descendants of the victims in an event jointly attended by representatives of the municipalities of Mal\u00ebsi e Madhe in Albania and Tuzi in Montenegro.<ref name=\"fjala\">{{cite web |title=100 VJETORI I MASAKR\u00cbS S\u00cb HOTIT, VENDOSET MEMORIALI |url=http://revista-fjala.com/12836-2/ |website=Fjala |accessdate=10 February 2020 |ref=fjala}}</ref> One of the descendants of those killed is Gjon Jun\u00e7aj, Albanian-American prosecutor and US envoy to Albania.<ref name=\"ocnal\">{{cite web |title=Hoti massacre commemorated; Albanian-American prosecutor Gjon Jun\u00e7aj: End of 100 years of Silence |url=https://www.ocnal.com/2019/12/hoti-massacre-commemorated-albanian.html |website=Ocnal |publisher=Ocnal |accessdate=10 February 2020 |ref=ocnal}}</ref>\n\nThe interwar period was marked by more refugees crossing the border and settling in Albania. They were given arable land and settled in villages that bore the name of their homeland. Thus, ''Hoti i Ri'' (New Hoti) was settled in 1932 by families of refugees that came from  Traboin.<ref name=\"9b\"/> In the now Yugoslav part of Hoti, the political situation was tense and unstable. Albania itself was falling under Italy's sphere of influence and Italy was presenting itself as the champion of Albanian national rights. In this political context, documents from the British [[Foreign Office]] describe a situation where, ''from Hoti and Grude in what used to be Montenegro, right along the Yugoslav frontier down to Dibra and Ochrida, no inconsiderable area and population await the crusade of an Albanian or Italian Liberator.''.<ref name=\"GB\">{{cite book |title=Documents on British Foreign Policy, 1919-1939 |date=1971 |publisher=Great Britain.

In 1945, the Yugoslav Partisans got control of Hoti and Gruda again. December 15 is the official date for the state celebration of the \"day of liberation\" of Tuzi.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sh\u00ebnohet 15 Dhjetori \u2013 Dita e \u00e7lirimit t\u00eb Tuzit |url=http://www.malesia.org/2010/12/17/shenohet-15-dhjetori-dita-e-clirimit-te-tuzit/ |website=Malesia.org |accessdate=10 February 2020}}</ref> After 1948, the border between Albania and Yugoslavia closed and became heavily militarized. Border regions like Hoti suffered in particular as family members became isolated from one another. In the 1990s, the collapse of the economy led to heavy migration throughout Hoti, Gruda and the northern highlands as was happening throughout the Balkans.\n\n==Traditions==\n[[File:Woman of the Hoti tribe, September 1908.jpg|thumb|300px|Traditional female dress of Hoti, 1908]]\n\nHoti is almost entirely Catholic. Its oldest church is in ruins and dates to around 1500.<ref name=\"kisha1\" /> Hoti was divided in two parishes: one in Rrapsh\u00eb and the other in Traboin. The church of Rrapsh\u00eb is the locality of Brigje (''kisha e Brigjes''). Francesco Bolizza recorded in 1616 when he was writing a report about the region. [[Pjet\u00ebr Bogdani]] in 1672 notes that in Brigje besides the church, there was also a school in function. Rrapsh\u00eb first became a parish in 1699, when the Franciscan Order settled in Hoti. One of the many franciscans, who served in the church of Brigje was Fra [[Gjergj Fishta]] in 1902.\n\nThe parish and church of Traboin first date to 1648 , but the church was later ruined and rebuilt. In 1696, Hoti gained ''bajrak'' status and other rights on the condition that one of its leaders converts to Islam. From that point, the bajraktar of Hoti is Muslim and those families that today are Muslim descend from this original conversion. Thus, in the late Ottoman period, the tribe of Hoti consisted of 500 Catholic households and 23 Muslim that included the family of the bajraktar.<ref name=\"Gawrych31\">{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=31.}}</ref> This conversion did not affect relations within the community as although Muslim, the bajraktar followed the traditions of the tribe. He annually funded the feast of St. John the Baptist ({{lang-sq|Sh\u00ebn Gjoni}} or ''Shnjoni''), the patron saint of Hoti, and observed mass on that day. \n\nThe funerary customs of Hoti as those of Mal\u00ebsia in general include the lamentation (''[[gjam\u00eb]]'') of the deceased in a collective manner by a group of men (''gjamatar\u00eb'').<ref name=\"gjura\">{{cite web |last1=Gjurav\u00e7aj |first1=Pjet\u00ebr |title=Vajtimet e grave dhe gjam\u00ebt e burrave n\u00eb Mal\u00ebsin\u00eb e Madhe - Hot, Grud\u00eb, Triepsh dhe Koj\u00eb ( 7) [Lamentation of men and women in Mal\u00ebsia - Hoti, Gruda, Triepshi, Koja |url=http://www.buzuku.info/Arkivi/Buzuku09/Let%C3%ABrsi_popullore.htm |website=Buzuku |publisher=Buzuku Magazine |accessdate=10 February 2020 |ref=gjura}}</ref>\n\n\n== Brotherhoods ==\nAll families (''barqe'') of Hoti belong to brotherhoods who are descended from the four sons of Geg Laz\u00ebr Keqi: Pjet\u00ebr, Jun\u00e7, Gjon, Laj\u00e7.\nIn addition to using the names of brotherhoods or that of the oldest known ancestor as surnames, individual families may also have a patronymic surname taken from a more recent ancestor or the village of origin.<ref name=\"Smajlaj\"/> From Pjet\u00ebr Gega, founder of Traboin, trace their descent: Goj\u00e7aj, Dedvukaj, Lekvukaj, Camaj, Gjok\u00eb-Camaj, Dushaj, Dakaj.

Handle uses many of the same dynamics, balance and mobile manipulation principles found in the quadruped and biped robots Boston Dynamics builds, but with only about 10 actuated joints, it is significantly less complex.<ref>{{cite web|title=Boston Dynamics Reveals Handle - An Amazing Robot|url=http://frenchtribune.com/teneur/25321-boston-dynamics-reveals-handle-amazing-robot|publisher=French Tribune|first=Bruce|last=Totolos|date=28 February 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180616154229/https://frenchtribune.com/teneur/25321-boston-dynamics-reveals-handle-amazing-robot|archive-date=16 June 2018|access-date=13 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite |first= Matt |last= McFarland |date= February 28, 2017 |title= Google officially reveals its latest robot |url= https://money.cnn.com/2017/02/28/technology/google-boston-dynamics-handle-robot/index.html |publisher= CNN |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190801165350/https://money.cnn.com/2017/02/28/technology/google-boston-dynamics-handle-robot/index.html |archive-date= August 1, 2019 |url-status= live |access-date= August 1, 2019 }}</ref>\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\n* In June 2019, a parody video went viral across social media in which a robot resembling Atlas was abused, before turning on its human attackers.
