The milk is traditionally from a [[cow]], [[goat]], [[sheep]] or [[Bovinae|buffalo]], although worldwide cow's milk is most commonly used and, in theory, cheese could be made from the milk of any mammal. The cheesemaker's goal is a consistent product with specific characteristics and organoleptic requirements (appearance, aroma, taste, texture).  The crafts and skills employed by the cheesemaker to make a [[Camembert (cheese)|Camembert]] will be similar to, but not quite the same as, those used to make [[Cheddar cheese|Cheddar]].\n\nSome cheeses may be deliberately left to ferment from naturally airborne [[spore]]s and [[bacteria]]; this approach generally leads to a less consistent product but one that is valuable in a niche market.\n\n===Culturing===\nTo make cheese, the cheesemaker brings milk (possibly [[Pasteurization|pasteurised]]) in the cheese vat to a temperature required to promote the growth of the bacteria that feed on lactose and thus [[Fermentation (food)|ferment]] the lactose into lactic acid. These bacteria in the milk may be wild, as is the case with unpasteurised milk, added from a [[Microbiological culture|culture]], frozen or [[Freeze drying|freeze dried]] concentrate of [[starter (fermentation)|starter]] bacteria. Bacteria which produce only lactic acid during fermentation are [[homofermentative]]; those that also produce lactic acid and other compounds such as [[carbon dioxide]], [[Ethanol|alcohol]], [[aldehydes]] and [[ketones]] are [[heterofermentative]]. Fermentation using homofermentative bacteria is important in the production of cheeses such as Cheddar, where a clean, [[acid]] flavour is required.  For cheeses such as [[Emmental cheese|Emmental]] the use of heterofermentative bacteria is necessary to produce the compounds that give characteristic fruity flavours and, importantly, the gas that results in the formation of bubbles in the cheese ('eye holes').\n\nCheesemakers choose starter cultures to give a cheese its specific characteristics. Also, if the cheesemaker intends to make a [[Mold (fungus)|mould]]-ripened cheese such as [[Stilton (cheese)|Stilton]], [[Roquefort]] or [[Camembert (cheese)|Camembert]], mould [[spore]]s (fungal spores) may be added to the milk in the cheese vat or can be added later to the cheese curd.\n\n===Coagulation===\nDuring the fermentation process, once the cheesemaker has gauged that sufficient lactic acid has been developed, [[rennet]] is added to cause the [[casein]] to [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]]. Rennet contains the enzyme [[chymosin]] which converts [[\u03ba-casein]] to para-\u03ba-caseinate (the main component of [[cheese curd]], which is a [[acid salt|salt]] of one fragment of the casein) and glycomacropeptide, which is lost in the cheese whey. As the curd is formed, milk fat is trapped in a casein matrix. After adding the rennet, the cheese milk is left to form curds over a period of time.\n[[File:Fresh chevre hanging in a farmstead dairy.jpg|thumb|Fresh [[chevre]] hanging in [[cheesecloth]] to drain.]]\n===Draining===\nOnce the cheese curd is judged to be ready, the cheese whey must be released. As with many foods the presence of [[water]] and the bacteria in it encourages [[decomposition]]. The cheesemaker must, therefore, remove most of the water (whey) from the cheese milk, and hence cheese curd, to make a partial [[Drying|dehydration]] of the curd. This ensures a product of good quality that will keep. There are several ways to separate the curd from the whey, and it is again controlled by the cheesemaker.\n[[File:Van Gaalen cheese cellar, South Africa.jpg|thumb|upright|Maturing cheese in a cheese cellar]]\n===Scalding===\nIn making Cheddar (or many other hard cheeses) the curd is cut into small cubes and the temperature is raised to approximately {{convert|39|C|0}} to 'scald' the curd particles. [[Syneresis (chemistry)|Syneresis]] occurs and cheese whey is expressed from the particles. The Cheddar curds and whey are often transferred from the cheese vat to a cooling table which contains screens that allow the whey to drain, but which trap the curd.  The curd is cut using long, blunt [[Knife|knives]] and 'blocked' (stacked, cut and turned) by the cheesemaker to promote the release of cheese whey in a process known as 'cheddaring'. During this process the [[acidity]] of the curd increases and when the cheesemaker is satisfied it has reached the required level, around 0.65%, the curd is milled into ribbon shaped pieces and [[Edible salt|salt]] is mixed into it to arrest acid development. The salted [[green cheese]] curd is put into cheese moulds lined with cheesecloths and pressed overnight to allow the curd particles to bind together. The pressed blocks of cheese are then removed from the cheese moulds and are either bound with [[muslin]]-like cloth, or [[wax]]ed or [[Vacuum packing|vacuum packed]] in [[plastic]] bags to be stored for maturation. Vacuum packing removes [[oxygen]] and prevents mould (fungal) growth during maturation, which depending on the wanted final product may be a desirable characteristic or not.\n\n===Mould-ripening===\n{{main|Cheese ripening}}\nIn contrast to cheddaring, making cheeses like [[Camembert]] requires a more gentle treatment of the curd. It is carefully transferred to cheese hoops and the whey is allowed to drain from the curd by [[gravity]], generally overnight. The cheese curds are then removed from the hoops to be [[brining|brined]] by immersion in a saturated salt [[solution]]. The salt absorption stops bacteria growing, as with Cheddar. If white [[Mold (fungus)|mould]] [[spore]]s have not been added to the cheese milk the cheesemaker applies them to the cheese either by spraying the cheese with a [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] of mould spores in water or by immersing the cheese in a bath containing spores of, e.g., ''[[Penicillium candida]]''.\n\nBy taking the cheese through a series of maturation stages where temperature and relative humidity are carefully controlled, the cheesemaker allows the surface mould to grow and the mould-ripening of the cheese by fungi to occur.  Mould-ripened cheeses ripen very quickly compared to hard cheeses (weeks against months or years). This is because the [[fungi]] used are biochemically very active when compared with starter [[bacteria]]. Some cheeses are surface-ripened by moulds, such as Camembert and Brie, some are ripened internally, such as Stilton, which is pierced by the cheesemaker with [[stainless steel]] [[wire]]s, to admit [[air]] to promote mould spore germination and growth, as with ''[[Penicillium roqueforti]]''. Surface ripening of some cheeses, such as [[Saint-Nectaire]], may also be influenced by [[yeasts]] which contribute flavour and coat texture.  Others are allowed by the cheesemaker to develop bacterial surface growths which give characteristic colours and appearances, e.g. by the growth of ''Brevibacterium linens'' which gives an orange coat to cheeses.\n\n==Quality control==\nCheesemakers must be skilled in the grading of cheese to assess quality, defects and suitability for release from the maturing store for sale. The grading process is one of [[Food sampling|sampling]] by sight, smell, taste and texture. Part of the cheesemaker's skill lies in the ability to predict when a cheese will be ready for sale or consumption, as the characteristics of cheese change constantly during maturation.\n\nA cheesemaker is thus a person who has developed the knowledge and skills required to convert [[milk]] into [[cheese]], by controlling precisely the types and amounts of ingredients used, and the parameters of the cheesemaking process, to make specific types and qualities of cheese. Most cheesemakers by virtue of their knowledge and experience are adept at making particular types of cheese. Few, if any, could quickly turn their hand to making other kinds.

Such is the specialisation of cheesemaking.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Food}}\n* [[List of cheesemakers]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{Cite book|last=Winstein|first=Merryl|year=2017|title=SUCCESSFUL CHEESEMAKING\u2122, Step-by-Step Directions and Photos for Making Nearly Every Type of Cheese, (670pp, 800 photos)|publication-place=St. Louis, Missouri|publisher=Smooth Stone Press|isbn=978-0998595955}}\n\n* {{Cite book|author1=Robinson, R.K.  |author2=Wilbey, R.A.|year=1998|edition=3rd|title=Cheesemaking practice|publication-place=Dordrecht|publisher=Kluwer Academic}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Banks|first=J|year=1998|edition=2nd|title=Cheese}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Early|first=R|title=The technology of dairy products|publication-place=London|publisher=Chapman and Hall}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Jenkins|first=Steven|year=1996|title=Cheese Primer|publication-place=New York|publisher=Workman Publishing}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Tannahill|first=Reay|year=2008|title=Food in History|publication-place=New York|publisher=Three Rivers Press}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070925001225/http://biology.clc.uc.edu/Fankhauser/Cheese/CHEESE.HTML Illustrated recipes for making cheese at home]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140202104817/http://www.sandandsuccotash.com/cheese-terminology-classifications/ Cheese Terminology and Classifications]\n{{cheesemakers}}\n\n[[Category:Cheesemakers| ]]\n[[Category:Food services occupations]]\n", "name_user": "Crouch, Swale", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toMold(link changed toMold (fungus); link changed toMold (fungus)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheesemaking"}
