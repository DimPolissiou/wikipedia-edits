When grouped together with the [[monatomic]] [[noble gases]] &ndash; [[helium]] (He), [[neon]] (Ne), [[argon]] (Ar), [[krypton]] (Kr), [[xenon]] (Xe), and [[radon]] (Rn) &ndash; these gases are called \"elemental gases\".\n\n==Etymology==\n{{improve|reason=\"pronounced like ch in \"loch\"\" -- and how is that ch pronounced (IPA?)?

The word \"gas\" first appears on [https://books.google.com/books?id=c41nbl8iwrEC&pg=PA58#v=onepage&q&f=false page 58], where he mentions: \"\u2026 Gas (meum scil. inventum) \u2026\" (\u2026 gas (namely, my discovery) \u2026). On [https://books.google.com/books?id=c41nbl8iwrEC&pg=PA59#v=onepage&q&f=false page 59], he states: \"\u2026 in nominis egestate, halitum illum, Gas vocavi, non longe a Chao \u2026\" (\u2026 in need of a name, I called this vapor \"gas\", not far from \"chaos\" \u2026)</ref> He identified [[carbon dioxide]], the first known gas other than air.<ref name=\"ley196606\">{{Cite magazine\n |last=Ley\n |first=Willy\n |date=June 1966\n |title=The Re-Designed Solar System\n |department=For Your Information\n |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v24n05_1966-06#page/n93/mode/2up\n |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction\n |pages=94\u2013106\n |type=\n}}</ref> Van Helmont's word appears to have been simply a phonetic transcription of the [[Ancient Greek]] word \u03c7\u03ac\u03bf\u03c2 ''[[Chaos (cosmogony)#Terminology|Chaos]]'' \u2013 the ''g'' in Dutch being pronounced like ''ch'' in \"loch\" (voiceless velar fricative, {{IPAc-en|x}}) \u2013 in which case Van Helmont was simply following the established [[alchemy|alchemical]] usage first attested in the works of [[Paracelsus]].

This was because certain gases suggested a supernatural origin, such as from their ability to cause death, extinguish flames, and to occur in \"mines, bottom of wells, churchyards and other lonely places\". In contrast, French-American historian Jacques Barzun<ref>{{cite book |last=Barzun|first=Jacques |title=For Dawn to Decadence: 500 Years of Western Cultural Life |date=2000 |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |location=New York |page=199 |url=https://www.harpercollins.ca/9780060928834/from-dawn-to-decadence-1500-to-the-present/}}</ref> speculated that Van Helmont had borrowed the word from the German ''G\u00e4scht'', meaning the froth resulting from fermentation.\n\n==Physical characteristics==\n[[File:Purplesmoke.jpg|right|thumb|border|text-bottom|Drifting [[smoke]] particles provide clues to the movement of the surrounding gas.]]\nBecause most gases are difficult to observe directly, they are described through the use of four [[physical properties]] or [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] characteristics: [[pressure]], [[volume (thermodynamics)|volume]], [[number of particles]] (chemists group them by [[mole (unit)|moles]]) and temperature. These four characteristics were repeatedly observed by scientists such as [[Robert Boyle]], [[Jacques Charles]], [[John Dalton]], [[Joseph Gay-Lussac]] and [[Amedeo Avogadro]] for a variety of gases in various settings. Their detailed studies ultimately led to a mathematical relationship among these properties expressed by the [[ideal gas law]] (see simplified models section below).\n\nGas particles are widely separated from one another, and consequently, have weaker intermolecular bonds than liquids or solids. These [[intermolecular forces]] result from electrostatic interactions between gas particles. Like-charged areas of different gas particles repel, while oppositely charged regions of different gas particles attract one another; gases that contain permanently charged [[ions]] are known as [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]s. Gaseous compounds with [[chemical polarity|polar covalent]] bonds contain permanent charge imbalances and so experience relatively strong intermolecular forces, although the molecule while the compound's net charge remains neutral.  Transient, randomly induced charges exist across non-polar [[covalent bond]]s of molecules and electrostatic interactions caused by them are referred to as [[Van der Waals force]]s. The interaction of these intermolecular forces varies within a substance which determines many of the physical properties unique to each gas.<ref>The authors make the connection between molecular forces of metals and their corresponding physical properties. By extension, this concept would apply to gases as well, though not universally. Cornell (1907) pp. 164\u20135.</ref><ref>One noticeable exception to this physical property connection is conductivity which varies depending on the state of matter (ionic compounds in water) as described by [[Michael Faraday]] in 1833 when he noted that ice does not conduct a current. See page 45 of John Tyndall's ''Faraday as a Discoverer'' (1868).</ref> A comparison of ''boiling points'' for compounds formed by ionic and covalent bonds leads us to this conclusion.<ref>{{cite book |author=John S. Hutchinson |url=http://cnx.org/content/col10264/latest/ |title=Concept Development Studies in Chemistry |date=2008 |page=67}}</ref> The drifting smoke particles in the image provides some insight into low-pressure gas behavior.\n\nCompared to the other states of matter, gases have low [[density]] and [[viscosity]]. [[Pressure]] and temperature influence the particles within a certain volume. This variation in particle separation and speed is referred to as ''compressibility''. This particle separation and size influences optical properties of gases as can be found in the following [[list of refractive indices]]. Finally, gas particles spread apart or [[diffusion|diffuse]] in order to homogeneously distribute themselves throughout any container.\n\n==Macroscopic==\n[[File:CFD Shuttle.jpg|right|thumb|border|text-bottom|Shuttle imagery of re-entry phase]]\n{{see also|Gas kinetics}}\nWhen observing a gas, it is typical to specify a frame of reference or [[length scale]]. A larger length scale corresponds to a [[macroscopic]] or global point of view of the gas. This region (referred to as a volume) must be sufficient in size to contain a large sampling of gas particles. The resulting statistical analysis of this sample size produces the \"average\" behavior (i.e. velocity, temperature or pressure) of all the gas particles within the region. In contrast, a smaller length scale corresponds to a [[microscopic]] or particle point of view.\n\nMacroscopically, the gas characteristics measured are either in terms of the gas particles themselves (velocity, pressure, or temperature) or their surroundings (volume). For example, Robert Boyle studied [[pneumatic chemistry]] for a small portion of his career. One of his experiments related the [[macroscopic]] properties of pressure and volume of a gas. His experiment used a J-tube [[manometer]] which looks like a [[test tube]] in the shape of the letter J. Boyle trapped an [[Inert gas|inert]] gas in the closed end of the test tube with a column of [[mercury (element)|mercury]], thereby making the number of particles and the temperature constant. He observed that when the pressure was increased in the gas, by adding more mercury to the column, the trapped gas' volume decreased (this is known as an [[inverse proportion|inverse]] relationship). Furthermore, when Boyle multiplied the pressure and volume of each observation, the [[Product (mathematics)|product]] was constant. This relationship held for every gas that Boyle observed leading to the law, (PV=k), named to honor his work in this field.\n\nThere are many mathematical tools available for analyzing gas properties. As gases are subjected to extreme conditions, these tools become more complex, from the [[Euler equations]]  for inviscid flow to the [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]]<ref>Anderson, p.501</ref> that fully account for viscous effects. These equations are adapted to the conditions of the gas system in question. Boyle's lab equipment allowed the use of [[algebra]] to obtain his analytical results. His results were possible because he was studying gases in relatively low pressure situations where they behaved in an \"ideal\" manner. These ideal relationships apply to safety calculations for a variety of flight conditions on the materials in use. The high technology equipment in use today was designed to help us safely explore the more exotic operating environments where the gases no longer behave in an \"ideal\" manner. This advanced math, including statistics and [[multivariable calculus]], makes possible the solution to such complex dynamic situations as space vehicle reentry. An example is the analysis of the space shuttle reentry pictured to ensure the material properties under this loading condition are appropriate.  In this flight regime, the gas is no longer behaving ideally.\n\n===Pressure===\n{{Main|Pressure}} \nThe symbol used to represent pressure in equations is '''\"p\"''' or '''\"P\"''' with SI units of [[pascal (unit)|pascals]].\n\nWhen describing a container of gas, the term [[pressure]] (or absolute pressure) refers to the average force per unit area that the gas exerts on the surface of the container. Within this volume, it is sometimes easier to visualize the gas particles moving in straight lines until they collide with the container (see diagram at top of the article). The force imparted by a gas particle into the container during this collision is the change in [[momentum]] of the particle.<ref>{{cite book |pages=319\u201320 |author=J.

A particle traveling parallel to the wall does not change its momentum. Therefore, the average force on a surface must be the average change in [[linear momentum]] from all of these gas particle collisions.\n\nPressure is the sum of all the [[normal component]]s of force exerted by the particles impacting the walls of the container divided by the surface area of the wall.\n\n===Temperature===\n[[File:Nitrogen.ogv|thumb|Air balloon shrinks after submersion in liquid nitrogen]]\n{{Main|Thermodynamic temperature}} The symbol used to represent ''temperature'' in equations is ''T'' with SI units of [[kelvin]]s.\n\nThe speed of a gas particle is proportional to its [[absolute temperature]]. The volume of the balloon in the video shrinks when the trapped gas particles slow down with the addition of extremely cold nitrogen. The temperature of any [[physical system]] is related to the motions of the particles (molecules and atoms) which make up the [gas] system.<ref>See pages 137\u20138 of Society, Cornell (1907).</ref> In [[statistical mechanics]], temperature is the measure of the average kinetic energy stored in a particle. The methods of storing this energy are dictated by the [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] of the particle itself ([[Energy level#Molecules|energy modes]]). Kinetic energy added ([[endothermic]] process) to gas particles by way of collisions produces linear, rotational, and vibrational motion. In contrast, a molecule in a solid can only increase its vibrational modes with the addition of heat as the lattice crystal structure prevents both linear and rotational motions. These heated gas molecules have a greater speed range which constantly varies due to constant collisions with other particles. The speed range can be described by the [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]]. Use of this distribution implies [[ideal gas]]es near [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] for the system of particles being considered.\n\n===Specific volume===\n\n{{Main|Specific volume}}\nThe symbol used to represent specific volume in equations is '''\"v\"''' with SI units of cubic meters per kilogram.\n{{See also|Gas volume}}\n\nThe symbol used to represent volume in equations is '''\"V\"''' with SI units of cubic meters.\n\nWhen performing a [[thermodynamic]] analysis, it is typical to speak of [[intensive and extensive properties]]. Properties which depend on the amount of gas (either by mass or volume) are called ''extensive'' properties, while properties that do not depend on the amount of gas are called intensive properties. Specific volume is an example of an intensive property because it is the ratio of volume occupied by a ''unit of mass'' of a gas that is identical throughout a system at equilibrium.<ref>{{cite book |page=[https://archive.org/details/thermodynamics0003wark/page/12 12] |author=Kenneth Wark |title=Thermodynamics |edition=3 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |date=1977 |isbn=978-0-07-068280-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/thermodynamics0003wark/page/12 }}</ref> 1000 atoms a gas occupy the same space as any other 1000 atoms for any given temperature and pressure. This concept is easier to visualize for solids such as iron which are [[incompressible]] compared to gases.  However, volume itself --- not specific --- is an extensive property.\n\n===Density===\n{{Main|Density}} \nThe symbol used to represent density in equations is '''\u03c1''' (rho) with SI units of kilograms per cubic meter. This term is the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of specific volume.\n\nSince gas molecules can move freely within a container, their mass is normally characterized by density. Density is the amount of mass per unit volume of a substance, or the inverse of specific volume. For gases, the density can vary over a wide range because the particles are free to move closer together when constrained by pressure or volume. This variation of density is referred to as [[compressibility]]. Like pressure and temperature, density is a [[state variable]] of a gas and the change in density during any process is governed by the laws of thermodynamics. For a [[Fluid statics|static gas]], the density is the same throughout the entire container. Density is therefore a [[Scalar (physics)|scalar quantity]]. It can be shown by kinetic theory that the density is inversely proportional to the size of the container in which a fixed mass of gas is confined. In this case of a fixed mass, the density decreases as the volume increases.\n\n==Microscopic==\nIf one could observe a gas under a powerful microscope, one would see a collection of particles (molecules, atoms, ions, electrons, etc.) without any definite shape or volume that are in more or less random motion. These neutral gas particles only change direction when they collide with another particle or with the sides of the container. In an ideal gas, these collisions are perfectly elastic. This particle or [[microscopic scale|microscopic]] view of a gas is described by the [[kinetic-molecular theory]]. The assumptions behind this theory can be found in the postulates section of [[Kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]].\n\n===Kinetic theory===\n{{Main|Kinetic theory of gases}}\n\n'''Kinetic theory''' provides insight into the macroscopic properties of gases by considering their molecular composition and motion. Starting with the definitions of [[momentum]] and [[kinetic energy]],<ref>For assumptions of kinetic theory see McPherson, pp.60\u201361</ref> one can use the [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation of momentum]] and geometric relationships of a cube to relate macroscopic system properties of temperature and pressure to the microscopic property of kinetic energy per molecule. The theory provides averaged values for these two properties.\n\nThe theory also explains how the gas system responds to change. For example, as a gas is heated from absolute zero, when it is (in theory) perfectly still, its [[internal energy]] (temperature) is increased. As a gas is heated, the particles speed up and its temperature rises. This results in greater numbers of collisions with the container per unit time due to the higher particle speeds associated with elevated temperatures.  The pressure increases in proportion to the number of collisions per unit time.\n\n===Brownian motion===\n[[File:Diffusion animation.gif|thumb|Random motion of gas particles results in [[diffusion]].]]\n{{Main|Brownian motion}} \nBrownian motion is the mathematical model used to describe the random movement of particles suspended in a fluid. The gas particle animation, using pink and green particles, illustrates how this behavior results in the spreading out of gases ([[entropy]]). These events are also described by [[particle|particle theory]].\n\nSince it is at the limit of (or beyond) current technology to observe individual gas particles (atoms or molecules), only theoretical calculations give suggestions about how they move, but their motion is different from Brownian motion because Brownian motion involves a smooth drag due to the frictional force of many gas molecules, punctuated by violent collisions of an individual (or several) gas molecule(s) with the particle. The particle (generally consisting of millions or billions of atoms) thus moves in a jagged course, yet not so jagged as would be expected if an individual gas molecule were examined.\n\n===Intermolecular forces===\n[[File:3D model hydrogen bonds in water.svg|left|thumb|border|text-top|When gases are compressed, intermolecular forces like those shown here start to play a more active role.]]\n{{Main|van der Waals force|Intermolecular force}}\nAs discussed earlier, momentary attractions (or repulsions) between particles have an effect on [[gas dynamics]]. In [[physical chemistry]], the name given to these intermolecular forces is ''van der Waals force''. These forces play a key role in determining [[physical properties]] of a gas such as [[viscosity]] and [[Mass flow rate|flow rate]] (see physical characteristics section). Ignoring these forces in certain conditions allows a [[real gas]] to be treated like an [[ideal gas]]. This assumption allows the use of [[ideal gas laws]] which greatly simplifies calculations.\n\nProper use of these gas relationships requires the [[kinetic-molecular theory]] (KMT). When gas particles experience [[intermolecular force]]s they gradually influence one another as the spacing between them is reduced (the hydrogen bond model illustrates one example). In the absence of any charge, at some point when the spacing between gas particles is greatly reduced they can no longer avoid collisions between themselves at normal gas temperatures. Another case for increased collisions among gas particles would include a fixed volume of gas, which upon heating would contain very fast particles. This means that these ideal equations provide reasonable results except for extremely high pressure (compressible) or high temperature (ionized) conditions. All of these excepted conditions allow energy transfer to take place within the gas system. The absence of these internal transfers is what is referred to as ideal conditions in which the energy exchange occurs only at the boundaries of the system. Real gases experience some of these collisions and intermolecular forces. When these collisions are statistically negligible (incompressible), results from these ideal equations are still meaningful. If the gas particles are compressed into close proximity they behave more like a liquid (see [[fluid dynamics]]).\n\n==Simplified models==\n{{Main|Equation of state}}\nAn ''equation of state'' (for gases) is a mathematical model used to roughly describe or predict the state properties of a gas. At present, there is no single equation of state that accurately predicts the properties of all gases under all conditions. Therefore, a number of much more accurate equations of state have been developed for gases in specific temperature and pressure ranges. The \"gas models\" that are most widely discussed are \"perfect gas\", \"ideal gas\" and \"real gas\". Each of these models has its own set of assumptions to facilitate the analysis of a given thermodynamic system.<ref>Anderson, pp. 289\u2013291</ref> Each successive model expands the temperature range of coverage to which it applies.\n\n===Ideal and perfect gas models===\n{{Main|Perfect gas}}\nThe [[equation of state]] for an ideal or perfect gas is the [[ideal gas law]] and reads\n:<math>PV=nRT,</math>\nwhere ''P'' is the pressure, ''V'' is the volume, ''n'' is amount of gas (in mol units), ''R'' is the [[universal gas constant]],  8.314&nbsp;J/(mol&nbsp;K), and ''T'' is the temperature. Written this way, it is sometimes called the \"chemist's version\", since it emphasizes the number of molecules ''n''. It can also be written as\n:<math>P=\\rho R_s T,</math>\nwhere <math>R_s</math> is the specific gas constant for a particular gas, in units J/(kg&nbsp;K), and \u03c1 = m/V is density. This notation is the \"gas dynamicist's\" version, which is more practical in modeling of gas flows involving acceleration without chemical reactions.\n\nThe ideal gas law does not make an assumption about the specific heat of a gas. In the most general case, the specific heat is a function of both temperature and pressure. If the pressure-dependence is neglected (and possibly the temperature-dependence as well) in a particular application, sometimes the gas is said to be a [[perfect gas]], although the exact assumptions may vary depending on the author and/or field of science.\n\nFor an ideal gas, the ideal gas law applies without restrictions on the specific heat. An ideal gas is a simplified \"real gas\" with the assumption that the [[compressibility factor]] ''Z'' is set to 1 meaning that this pneumatic ratio remains constant. A compressibility factor of one also requires the four state variables to follow the [[ideal gas law]].\n\nThis approximation is more suitable for applications in engineering although simpler models can be used to produce a \"ball-park\" range as to where the real solution should lie. An example where the \"ideal gas approximation\" would be suitable would be inside a [[Jet engine#Combustors|combustion chamber]] of a [[jet engine]].<ref>John, p.205</ref> It may also be useful to keep the elementary reactions and chemical dissociations for calculating [[Exhaust gas|emissions]].\n\n===Real gas===\n[[File:MountRedoubtEruption.jpg|thumb|21 April 1990 eruption of [[Mount Redoubt]], Alaska, illustrating real gases not in thermodynamic equilibrium.]]\n{{Main|Real gas}}\nEach one of the assumptions listed below adds to the complexity of the problem's solution. As the density of a gas increases with rising pressure, the intermolecular forces play a more substantial role in gas behavior which results in the ideal gas law no longer providing \"reasonable\" results. At the upper end of the engine temperature ranges (e.g. combustor sections \u2013 1300 K), the complex fuel particles absorb internal energy by means of rotations and vibrations that cause their specific heats to vary from those of diatomic molecules and noble gases. At more than double that temperature, electronic excitation and dissociation of the gas particles begins to occur causing the pressure to adjust to a greater number of particles (transition from gas to [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]).<ref>John, pp. 247\u201356</ref> Finally, all of the thermodynamic processes were presumed to describe uniform gases whose velocities varied according to a fixed distribution. Using a non-equilibrium situation implies the flow field must be characterized in some manner to enable a solution. One of the first attempts to expand the boundaries of the ideal gas law was to include coverage for different [[thermodynamic process]]es by adjusting the equation to read ''pV<sup>n</sup> = constant'' and then varying the ''n'' through different values such as the [[Heat capacity ratio|specific heat ratio]], ''\u03b3''.\n\nReal gas effects include those adjustments made to account for a greater range of gas behavior:\n*[[Compressibility factor|Compressibility effects]] (''Z'' allowed to vary from 1.0)\n*Variable [[heat capacity]] (specific heats vary with temperature)\n*Van der Waals forces (related to compressibility, can substitute other equations of state)\n*[[Non-equilibrium thermodynamics|Non-equilibrium thermodynamic effects]]\n*Issues with molecular [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] and [[elementary reaction]]s with variable composition.\n\nFor most applications, such a detailed analysis is excessive. Examples where real gas effects would have a significant impact would be on the [[Space Shuttle]] [[Atmospheric reentry|re-entry]] where extremely high temperatures and pressures were present or the gases produced during geological events as in the image of the 1990 eruption of [[Mount Redoubt]].\n\n==Historical research==\n{{see also|Gas laws}}\n\n===Boyle's law===\n[[File:Boyle air pump.jpg|right|thumb|border|text-top|upright|Boyle's equipment]]\n{{Main|Boyle's law}}\nBoyle's law was perhaps the first expression of an equation of state. In 1662 [[Robert Boyle]] performed a series of experiments employing a J-shaped glass tube, which was sealed on one end. Mercury was added to the tube, trapping a fixed quantity of air in the short, sealed end of the tube. Then the volume of gas was carefully measured as additional mercury was added to the tube. The pressure of the gas could be determined by the difference between the mercury level in the short end of the tube and that in the long, open end. The image of Boyle's equipment shows some of the exotic tools used by Boyle during his study of gases.\n\nThrough these experiments, Boyle noted that the pressure exerted by a gas held at a constant temperature varies inversely with the volume of the gas.<ref>McPherson, pp.52\u201355</ref>  For example, if the volume is halved, the pressure is doubled; and if the volume is doubled, the pressure is halved. Given the inverse relationship between pressure and volume, the product of pressure (''P'') and volume (''V'') is a constant (''k'') for a given mass of confined gas as long as the temperature is constant. Stated as a formula, thus is:\n\n:<math> PV = k </math>\n\nBecause the before and after volumes and pressures of the fixed amount of gas, where the before and after temperatures are the same both equal the constant ''k'', they can be related by the equation:\n\n<math>\\qquad P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2.</math>\n\n=== Charles's law ===\n{{Main|Charles's law}}\nIn 1787, the French physicist and balloon pioneer, [[Jacques Charles]], found that oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and air expand to the same extent over the same 80 kelvin interval. He noted that, for an ideal gas at constant pressure, the volume is directly proportional to its temperature:\n\n: <math>\\frac{V_1}{T_1} = \\frac{V_2}{T_2}</math>\n\n===Gay-Lussac's law===\n{{Main|Gay-Lussac's law}}\nIn 1802, [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] published results of similar, though more extensive experiments.<ref>McPherson, pp.55\u201360</ref> Gay-Lussac credited Charles' earlier work by naming the law in his honor. Gay-Lussac himself is credited with the law describing pressure, which he found in 1809. It states that the pressure exerted on a container's sides by an ideal gas is proportional to its temperature.\n:<math> \\frac{P_1}{T_1}=\\frac{P_2}{T_2}    \\,</math>\n\n===Avogadro's law===\n{{Main|Avogadro's law}}\nIn 1811, Amedeo Avogadro verified that equal volumes of pure gases contain the same number of particles. His theory was not generally accepted until 1858 when another Italian chemist Stanislao Cannizzaro was able to explain non-ideal exceptions. For his work with gases a century prior, the number that bears his name [[Avogadro's constant]] represents the number of atoms found in 12&nbsp;grams of elemental carbon-12 (6.022\u00d710<sup>23</sup> mol<sup>\u22121</sup>). This specific number of gas particles, at standard temperature and pressure (ideal gas law) occupies 22.40 liters, which is referred to as the [[molar volume]].\n\nAvogadro's law states that the volume occupied by an ideal gas is proportional to the number of [[mole (unit)|moles]] (or molecules) present in the container. This gives rise to the [[molar volume]] of a gas, which at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|STP]] is 22.4 dm<sup>3</sup> (or litres). The relation is given by\n\n:<math>\\frac{V_1}{n_1}=\\frac{V_2}{n_2}    \\,</math>\n\nwhere n is equal to the number of moles of gas (the number of molecules divided by [[Avogadro's number]]).\n\n===Dalton's law===\n[[File:Daltons symbols.gif|thumb|border|text-top|[[John Dalton|Dalton]]'s notation.]]\n\n{{Main|Dalton's law}}\nIn 1801, [[John Dalton]] published the law of partial pressures from his work with ideal gas law relationship: The pressure of a mixture of non reactive gases is equal to the sum of the pressures of all of the constituent gases alone. Mathematically, this can be represented for ''n'' species as:\n\n: '''Pressure<sub>total</sub> = Pressure<sub>1</sub> + Pressure<sub>2</sub> + ... + Pressure<sub>''n''</sub>'''\n\nThe image of Dalton's journal depicts symbology he used as shorthand to record the path he followed. Among his key journal observations upon mixing unreactive \"elastic fluids\" (gases) were the following:<ref>{{cite book |pages=72, 77\u201378 |author=John P. Millington |title=John Dalton |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.30924 |date=1906}}</ref>\n*Unlike liquids, heavier gases did not drift to the bottom upon mixing.\n*Gas particle identity played no role in determining final pressure (they behaved as if their size was negligible).\n\n==Special topics==\n\n===Compressibility===\n[[File:Compressibility Factor of Air 75-200 K.png|right|thumb|border|text-top|Compressibility factors for air.]]\n{{Main|Compressibility factor}}\nThermodynamicists use this factor (''Z'') to alter the ideal gas equation to account for compressibility effects of real gases. This factor represents the ratio of actual to ideal specific volumes. It is sometimes referred to as a \"fudge-factor\" or correction to expand the useful range of the ideal gas law for design purposes. ''Usually'' this ''Z'' value is very close to unity. The compressibility factor image illustrates how Z varies over a range of very cold temperatures.\n\n===Reynolds number===\n{{Main|Reynolds number}}\nIn fluid mechanics, the Reynolds number is the ratio of inertial forces (''v<sub>s</sub>\u03c1'') to viscous forces (''\u03bc/L''). It is one of the most important dimensionless numbers in fluid dynamics and is used, usually along with other dimensionless numbers, to provide a criterion for determining dynamic similitude. As such, the Reynolds number provides the link between modeling results (design) and the full-scale actual conditions. It can also be used to characterize the flow.\n\n===Viscosity===\n[[File:Vortex-street-1.jpg|thumb|upright|Satellite view of weather pattern in vicinity of [[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands|Robinson Crusoe Islands]] on 15 September 1999, shows a turbulent cloud pattern called a [[K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortex street]]]]\n{{Main|Viscosity}}\nViscosity, a physical property, is a measure of how well adjacent molecules stick to one another. A solid can withstand a shearing force due to the strength of these sticky intermolecular forces. A fluid will continuously deform when subjected to a similar load. While a gas has a lower value of viscosity than a liquid, it is still an observable property. If gases had no viscosity, then they would not stick to the surface of a wing and form a boundary layer. A study of the [[delta wing]] in the [[Schlieren photography|Schlieren]] image reveals that the gas particles stick to one another (see Boundary layer section).\n\n===Turbulence===\n[[File:Schlierenfoto Mach 17 Delta - NASA.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Delta wing]] in wind tunnel. The shadows form as the indices of refraction change within the gas as it compresses on the leading edge of this wing.]]\n{{Main|Turbulence}}\nIn fluid dynamics, turbulence or turbulent flow is a flow regime characterized by chaotic, stochastic property changes. This includes low momentum diffusion, high momentum convection, and rapid variation of pressure and velocity in space and time. The satellite view of weather around Robinson Crusoe Islands illustrates one example.\n\n===Boundary layer===\n{{Main|Boundary layer}}\nParticles will, in effect, \"stick\" to the surface of an object moving through it. This layer of particles is called the boundary layer. At the surface of the object, it is essentially static due to the friction of the surface. The object, with its boundary layer is effectively the new shape of the object that the rest of the molecules \"see\" as the object approaches. This boundary layer can separate from the surface, essentially creating a new surface and completely changing the flow path. The classical example of this is a [[Stall (flight)#Formal definition|stalling airfoil]]. The delta wing image clearly shows the boundary layer thickening as the gas flows from right to left along the leading edge.\n\n===Maximum entropy principle===\n{{Main|Principle of maximum entropy}}\nAs the total number of degrees of freedom approaches infinity, the system will be found in the [[macrostate]] that corresponds to the highest [[multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]]. In order to illustrate this principle, observe the skin temperature of a frozen metal bar. Using a thermal image of the skin temperature, note the temperature distribution on the surface. This initial observation of temperature represents a \"[[microstate]]\". At some future time, a second observation of the skin temperature produces a second microstate. By continuing this observation process, it is possible to produce a series of microstates that illustrate the thermal history of the bar's surface. Characterization of this historical series of microstates is possible by choosing the macrostate that successfully classifies them all into a single grouping.\n\n===Thermodynamic equilibrium===\n{{Main|Thermodynamic equilibrium}}\nWhen energy transfer ceases from a system, this condition is referred to as thermodynamic equilibrium. Usually, this condition implies the system and surroundings are at the same temperature so that heat no longer transfers between them. It also implies that external forces are balanced (volume does not change), and all chemical reactions within the system are complete. The timeline varies for these events depending on the system in question. A container of ice allowed to melt at room temperature takes hours, while in semiconductors the heat transfer that occurs in the device transition from an on to off state could be on the order of a few nanoseconds.\n\n===Effect on state sovereignty===\n{{Main|Sovereignty}}\nIncreased anthropogenic gaseous emissions diminish state sovereignty because states cannot protect their citizens from the effects of other states' emissions.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Habib |first1=Benjamin |title=Climate Change and the Re-imagination of State Sovereignty |url=https://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/blog/19/04/2016/climate-change-and-re-imagination-state-sovereignty |website=Global Policy Journal |publisher=Durham University |accessdate=20 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Greenhouse gas]]\n*[[List of gases]]\n*[[Natural gas]]\n*[[Volcanic gas]]\n*[[Breathing gas]]\n*[[Wind]]\n{{Table_of_phase_transitions}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book |author=Anderson, John D. |authorlink=John D.

A gas [[mixture]], such as [[Earth's atmosphere|air]], contains a variety of pure gases. What distinguishes a gas from liquids and solids is the vast separation of the individual gas particles.

On [https://books.google.com/books?id=c41nbl8iwrEC&pg=PA59#v=onepage&q&f=false page 59], he states: \"\u2026 in nominis egestate, halitum illum, Gas vocavi, non longe a Chao \u2026\" (\u2026 in need of a name, I called this vapor \"gas\", not far from \"chaos\" \u2026)</ref> He identified [[carbon dioxide]], the first known gas other than air.<ref name=\"ley196606\">{{Cite magazine\n |last=Ley\n |first=Willy\n |date=June 1966\n |title=The Re-Designed Solar System\n |department=For Your Information\n |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v24n05_1966-06#page/n93/mode/2up\n |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction\n |pages=94\u2013106\n |type=\n}}</ref> Van Helmont's word appears to have been simply a phonetic transcription of the [[Ancient Greek]] word \u03c7\u03ac\u03bf\u03c2 ''[[Chaos (cosmogony)#Terminology|Chaos]]'' \u2013 the ''g'' in Dutch being pronounced like ''ch'' in \"loch\" (voiceless velar fricative, {{IPAc-en|x}}) \u2013 in which case Van Helmont was simply following the established [[alchemy|alchemical]] usage first attested in the works of [[Paracelsus]].

This was because certain gases suggested a supernatural origin, such as from their ability to cause death, extinguish flames, and to occur in \"mines, bottom of wells, churchyards and other lonely places\". In contrast, French-American historian Jacques Barzun<ref>{{cite book |last=Barzun|first=Jacques |title=For Dawn to Decadence: 500 Years of Western Cultural Life |date=2000 |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |location=New York |page=199 |url=https://www.harpercollins.ca/9780060928834/from-dawn-to-decadence-1500-to-the-present/}}</ref> speculated that Van Helmont had borrowed the word from the German ''G\u00e4scht'', meaning the froth resulting from fermentation.\n\n==Physical characteristics==\n[[File:Purplesmoke.jpg|right|thumb|border|text-bottom|Drifting [[smoke]] particles provide clues to the movement of the surrounding gas.]]\nBecause most gases are difficult to observe directly, they are described through the use of four [[physical properties]] or [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] characteristics: [[pressure]], [[volume (thermodynamics)|volume]], [[number of particles]] (chemists group them by [[mole (unit)|moles]]) and temperature. These four characteristics were repeatedly observed by scientists such as [[Robert Boyle]], [[Jacques Charles]], [[John Dalton]], [[Joseph Gay-Lussac]] and [[Amedeo Avogadro]] for a variety of gases in various settings. Their detailed studies ultimately led to a mathematical relationship among these properties expressed by the [[ideal gas law]] (see simplified models section below).\n\nGas particles are widely separated from one another, and consequently, have weaker intermolecular bonds than liquids or solids. These [[intermolecular forces]] result from electrostatic interactions between gas particles. Like-charged areas of different gas particles repel, while oppositely charged regions of different gas particles attract one another; gases that contain permanently charged [[ions]] are known as [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]s. Gaseous compounds with [[chemical polarity|polar covalent]] bonds contain permanent charge imbalances and so experience relatively strong intermolecular forces, although the molecule while the compound's net charge remains neutral.  Transient, randomly induced charges exist across non-polar [[covalent bond]]s of molecules and electrostatic interactions caused by them are referred to as [[Van der Waals force]]s. The interaction of these intermolecular forces varies within a substance which determines many of the physical properties unique to each gas.<ref>The authors make the connection between molecular forces of metals and their corresponding physical properties. By extension, this concept would apply to gases as well, though not universally. Cornell (1907) pp. 164\u20135.</ref><ref>One noticeable exception to this physical property connection is conductivity which varies depending on the state of matter (ionic compounds in water) as described by [[Michael Faraday]] in 1833 when he noted that ice does not conduct a current. See page 45 of John Tyndall's ''Faraday as a Discoverer'' (1868).</ref> A comparison of ''boiling points'' for compounds formed by ionic and covalent bonds leads us to this conclusion.<ref>{{cite book |author=John S. Hutchinson |url=http://cnx.org/content/col10264/latest/ |title=Concept Development Studies in Chemistry |date=2008 |page=67}}</ref> The drifting smoke particles in the image provides some insight into low-pressure gas behavior.\n\nCompared to the other states of matter, gases have low [[density]] and [[viscosity]]. [[Pressure]] and temperature influence the particles within a certain volume. This variation in particle separation and speed is referred to as ''compressibility''. This particle separation and size influences optical properties of gases as can be found in the following [[list of refractive indices]]. Finally, gas particles spread apart or [[diffusion|diffuse]] in order to homogeneously distribute themselves throughout any container.\n\n==Macroscopic==\n[[File:CFD Shuttle.jpg|right|thumb|border|text-bottom|Shuttle imagery of re-entry phase]]\n{{see also|Gas kinetics}}\nWhen observing a gas, it is typical to specify a frame of reference or [[length scale]]. A larger length scale corresponds to a [[macroscopic]] or global point of view of the gas. This region (referred to as a volume) must be sufficient in size to contain a large sampling of gas particles. The resulting statistical analysis of this sample size produces the \"average\" behavior (i.e. velocity, temperature or pressure) of all the gas particles within the region. In contrast, a smaller length scale corresponds to a [[microscopic]] or particle point of view.\n\nMacroscopically, the gas characteristics measured are either in terms of the gas particles themselves (velocity, pressure, or temperature) or their surroundings (volume). For example, Robert Boyle studied [[pneumatic chemistry]] for a small portion of his career. One of his experiments related the [[macroscopic]] properties of pressure and volume of a gas. His experiment used a J-tube [[manometer]] which looks like a [[test tube]] in the shape of the letter J. Boyle trapped an [[Inert gas|inert]] gas in the closed end of the test tube with a column of [[mercury (element)|mercury]], thereby making the number of particles and the temperature constant. He observed that when the pressure was increased in the gas, by adding more mercury to the column, the trapped gas' volume decreased (this is known as an [[inverse proportion|inverse]] relationship). Furthermore, when Boyle multiplied the pressure and volume of each observation, the [[Product (mathematics)|product]] was constant. This relationship held for every gas that Boyle observed leading to the law, (PV=k), named to honor his work in this field.\n\nThere are many mathematical tools available for analyzing gas properties. As gases are subjected to extreme conditions, these tools become more complex, from the [[Euler equations]]  for inviscid flow to the [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]]<ref>Anderson, p.501</ref> that fully account for viscous effects. These equations are adapted to the conditions of the gas system in question. Boyle's lab equipment allowed the use of [[algebra]] to obtain his analytical results. His results were possible because he was studying gases in relatively low pressure situations where they behaved in an \"ideal\" manner. These ideal relationships apply to safety calculations for a variety of flight conditions on the materials in use. The high technology equipment in use today was designed to help us safely explore the more exotic operating environments where the gases no longer behave in an \"ideal\" manner. This advanced math, including statistics and [[multivariable calculus]], makes possible the solution to such complex dynamic situations as space vehicle reentry. An example is the analysis of the space shuttle reentry pictured to ensure the material properties under this loading condition are appropriate.  In this flight regime, the gas is no longer behaving ideally.\n\n===Pressure===\n{{Main|Pressure}} \nThe symbol used to represent pressure in equations is '''\"p\"''' or '''\"P\"''' with SI units of [[pascal (unit)|pascals]].\n\nWhen describing a container of gas, the term [[pressure]] (or absolute pressure) refers to the average force per unit area that the gas exerts on the surface of the container. Within this volume, it is sometimes easier to visualize the gas particles moving in straight lines until they collide with the container (see diagram at top of the article). The force imparted by a gas particle into the container during this collision is the change in [[momentum]] of the particle.<ref>{{cite book |pages=319\u201320 |author=J. Clerk Maxwell |title=Theory of Heat |date=1904 |isbn=978-0-486-41735-6 |publisher=Dover Publications |location=Mineola}}</ref> During a collision only the [[normal (geometry)|normal]] component of velocity changes. A particle traveling parallel to the wall does not change its momentum. Therefore, the average force on a surface must be the average change in [[linear momentum]] from all of these gas particle collisions.\n\nPressure is the sum of all the [[normal component]]s of force exerted by the particles impacting the walls of the container divided by the surface area of the wall.\n\n===Temperature===\n[[File:Nitrogen.ogv|thumb|Air balloon shrinks after submersion in liquid nitrogen]]\n{{Main|Thermodynamic temperature}} The symbol used to represent ''temperature'' in equations is ''T'' with SI units of [[kelvin]]s.\n\nThe speed of a gas particle is proportional to its [[absolute temperature]]. The volume of the balloon in the video shrinks when the trapped gas particles slow down with the addition of extremely cold nitrogen. The temperature of any [[physical system]] is related to the motions of the particles (molecules and atoms) which make up the [gas] system.<ref>See pages 137\u20138 of Society, Cornell (1907).</ref> In [[statistical mechanics]], temperature is the measure of the average kinetic energy stored in a particle. The methods of storing this energy are dictated by the [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] of the particle itself ([[Energy level#Molecules|energy modes]]). Kinetic energy added ([[endothermic]] process) to gas particles by way of collisions produces linear, rotational, and vibrational motion. In contrast, a molecule in a solid can only increase its vibrational modes with the addition of heat as the lattice crystal structure prevents both linear and rotational motions. These heated gas molecules have a greater speed range which constantly varies due to constant collisions with other particles. The speed range can be described by the [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]]. Use of this distribution implies [[ideal gas]]es near [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] for the system of particles being considered.\n\n===Specific volume===\n\n{{Main|Specific volume}}\nThe symbol used to represent specific volume in equations is '''\"v\"''' with SI units of cubic meters per kilogram.\n{{See also|Gas volume}}\n\nThe symbol used to represent volume in equations is '''\"V\"''' with SI units of cubic meters.\n\nWhen performing a [[thermodynamic]] analysis, it is typical to speak of [[intensive and extensive properties]]. Properties which depend on the amount of gas (either by mass or volume) are called ''extensive'' properties, while properties that do not depend on the amount of gas are called intensive properties. Specific volume is an example of an intensive property because it is the ratio of volume occupied by a ''unit of mass'' of a gas that is identical throughout a system at equilibrium.<ref>{{cite book |page=[https://archive.org/details/thermodynamics0003wark/page/12 12] |author=Kenneth Wark |title=Thermodynamics |edition=3 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |date=1977 |isbn=978-0-07-068280-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/thermodynamics0003wark/page/12 }}</ref> 1000 atoms a gas occupy the same space as any other 1000 atoms for any given temperature and pressure. This concept is easier to visualize for solids such as iron which are [[incompressible]] compared to gases.  However, volume itself --- not specific --- is an extensive property.\n\n===Density===\n{{Main|Density}} \nThe symbol used to represent density in equations is '''\u03c1''' (rho) with SI units of kilograms per cubic meter. This term is the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of specific volume.\n\nSince gas molecules can move freely within a container, their mass is normally characterized by density. Density is the amount of mass per unit volume of a substance, or the inverse of specific volume. For gases, the density can vary over a wide range because the particles are free to move closer together when constrained by pressure or volume. This variation of density is referred to as [[compressibility]]. Like pressure and temperature, density is a [[state variable]] of a gas and the change in density during any process is governed by the laws of thermodynamics. For a [[Fluid statics|static gas]], the density is the same throughout the entire container. Density is therefore a [[Scalar (physics)|scalar quantity]]. It can be shown by kinetic theory that the density is inversely proportional to the size of the container in which a fixed mass of gas is confined. In this case of a fixed mass, the density decreases as the volume increases.\n\n==Microscopic==\nIf one could observe a gas under a powerful microscope, one would see a collection of particles (molecules, atoms, ions, electrons, etc.) without any definite shape or volume that are in more or less random motion. These neutral gas particles only change direction when they collide with another particle or with the sides of the container. In an ideal gas, these collisions are perfectly elastic. This particle or [[microscopic scale|microscopic]] view of a gas is described by the [[kinetic-molecular theory]]. The assumptions behind this theory can be found in the postulates section of [[Kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]].\n\n===Kinetic theory===\n{{Main|Kinetic theory of gases}}\n\n'''Kinetic theory''' provides insight into the macroscopic properties of gases by considering their molecular composition and motion. Starting with the definitions of [[momentum]] and [[kinetic energy]],<ref>For assumptions of kinetic theory see McPherson, pp.60\u201361</ref> one can use the [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation of momentum]] and geometric relationships of a cube to relate macroscopic system properties of temperature and pressure to the microscopic property of kinetic energy per molecule. The theory provides averaged values for these two properties.\n\nThe theory also explains how the gas system responds to change. For example, as a gas is heated from absolute zero, when it is (in theory) perfectly still, its [[internal energy]] (temperature) is increased. As a gas is heated, the particles speed up and its temperature rises. This results in greater numbers of collisions with the container per unit time due to the higher particle speeds associated with elevated temperatures.  The pressure increases in proportion to the number of collisions per unit time.\n\n===Brownian motion===\n[[File:Diffusion animation.gif|thumb|Random motion of gas particles results in [[diffusion]].]]\n{{Main|Brownian motion}} \nBrownian motion is the mathematical model used to describe the random movement of particles suspended in a fluid. The gas particle animation, using pink and green particles, illustrates how this behavior results in the spreading out of gases ([[entropy]]). These events are also described by [[particle|particle theory]].\n\nSince it is at the limit of (or beyond) current technology to observe individual gas particles (atoms or molecules), only theoretical calculations give suggestions about how they move, but their motion is different from Brownian motion because Brownian motion involves a smooth drag due to the frictional force of many gas molecules, punctuated by violent collisions of an individual (or several) gas molecule(s) with the particle. The particle (generally consisting of millions or billions of atoms) thus moves in a jagged course, yet not so jagged as would be expected if an individual gas molecule were examined.\n\n===Intermolecular forces===\n[[File:3D model hydrogen bonds in water.svg|left|thumb|border|text-top|When gases are compressed, intermolecular forces like those shown here start to play a more active role.]]\n{{Main|van der Waals force|Intermolecular force}}\nAs discussed earlier, momentary attractions (or repulsions) between particles have an effect on [[gas dynamics]]. In [[physical chemistry]], the name given to these intermolecular forces is ''van der Waals force''. These forces play a key role in determining [[physical properties]] of a gas such as [[viscosity]] and [[Mass flow rate|flow rate]] (see physical characteristics section). Ignoring these forces in certain conditions allows a [[real gas]] to be treated like an [[ideal gas]]. This assumption allows the use of [[ideal gas laws]] which greatly simplifies calculations.\n\nProper use of these gas relationships requires the [[kinetic-molecular theory]] (KMT). When gas particles experience [[intermolecular force]]s they gradually influence one another as the spacing between them is reduced (the hydrogen bond model illustrates one example). In the absence of any charge, at some point when the spacing between gas particles is greatly reduced they can no longer avoid collisions between themselves at normal gas temperatures. Another case for increased collisions among gas particles would include a fixed volume of gas, which upon heating would contain very fast particles. This means that these ideal equations provide reasonable results except for extremely high pressure (compressible) or high temperature (ionized) conditions. All of these excepted conditions allow energy transfer to take place within the gas system. The absence of these internal transfers is what is referred to as ideal conditions in which the energy exchange occurs only at the boundaries of the system. Real gases experience some of these collisions and intermolecular forces. When these collisions are statistically negligible (incompressible), results from these ideal equations are still meaningful. If the gas particles are compressed into close proximity they behave more like a liquid (see [[fluid dynamics]]).\n\n==Simplified models==\n{{Main|Equation of state}}\nAn ''equation of state'' (for gases) is a mathematical model used to roughly describe or predict the state properties of a gas. At present, there is no single equation of state that accurately predicts the properties of all gases under all conditions. Therefore, a number of much more accurate equations of state have been developed for gases in specific temperature and pressure ranges. The \"gas models\" that are most widely discussed are \"perfect gas\", \"ideal gas\" and \"real gas\". Each of these models has its own set of assumptions to facilitate the analysis of a given thermodynamic system.<ref>Anderson, pp. 289\u2013291</ref> Each successive model expands the temperature range of coverage to which it applies.\n\n===Ideal and perfect gas models===\n{{Main|Perfect gas}}\nThe [[equation of state]] for an ideal or perfect gas is the [[ideal gas law]] and reads\n:<math>PV=nRT,</math>\nwhere ''P'' is the pressure, ''V'' is the volume, ''n'' is amount of gas (in mol units), ''R'' is the [[universal gas constant]],  8.314&nbsp;J/(mol&nbsp;K), and ''T'' is the temperature. Written this way, it is sometimes called the \"chemist's version\", since it emphasizes the number of molecules ''n''. It can also be written as\n:<math>P=\\rho R_s T,</math>\nwhere <math>R_s</math> is the specific gas constant for a particular gas, in units J/(kg&nbsp;K), and \u03c1 = m/V is density. This notation is the \"gas dynamicist's\" version, which is more practical in modeling of gas flows involving acceleration without chemical reactions.\n\nThe ideal gas law does not make an assumption about the specific heat of a gas. In the most general case, the specific heat is a function of both temperature and pressure. If the pressure-dependence is neglected (and possibly the temperature-dependence as well) in a particular application, sometimes the gas is said to be a [[perfect gas]], although the exact assumptions may vary depending on the author and/or field of science.\n\nFor an ideal gas, the ideal gas law applies without restrictions on the specific heat. An ideal gas is a simplified \"real gas\" with the assumption that the [[compressibility factor]] ''Z'' is set to 1 meaning that this pneumatic ratio remains constant. A compressibility factor of one also requires the four state variables to follow the [[ideal gas law]].\n\nThis approximation is more suitable for applications in engineering although simpler models can be used to produce a \"ball-park\" range as to where the real solution should lie. An example where the \"ideal gas approximation\" would be suitable would be inside a [[Jet engine#Combustors|combustion chamber]] of a [[jet engine]].<ref>John, p.205</ref> It may also be useful to keep the elementary reactions and chemical dissociations for calculating [[Exhaust gas|emissions]].\n\n===Real gas===\n[[File:MountRedoubtEruption.jpg|thumb|21 April 1990 eruption of [[Mount Redoubt]], Alaska, illustrating real gases not in thermodynamic equilibrium.]]\n{{Main|Real gas}}\nEach one of the assumptions listed below adds to the complexity of the problem's solution. As the density of a gas increases with rising pressure, the intermolecular forces play a more substantial role in gas behavior which results in the ideal gas law no longer providing \"reasonable\" results. At the upper end of the engine temperature ranges (e.g. combustor sections \u2013 1300 K), the complex fuel particles absorb internal energy by means of rotations and vibrations that cause their specific heats to vary from those of diatomic molecules and noble gases. At more than double that temperature, electronic excitation and dissociation of the gas particles begins to occur causing the pressure to adjust to a greater number of particles (transition from gas to [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]).<ref>John, pp. 247\u201356</ref> Finally, all of the thermodynamic processes were presumed to describe uniform gases whose velocities varied according to a fixed distribution. Using a non-equilibrium situation implies the flow field must be characterized in some manner to enable a solution. One of the first attempts to expand the boundaries of the ideal gas law was to include coverage for different [[thermodynamic process]]es by adjusting the equation to read ''pV<sup>n</sup> = constant'' and then varying the ''n'' through different values such as the [[Heat capacity ratio|specific heat ratio]], ''\u03b3''.\n\nReal gas effects include those adjustments made to account for a greater range of gas behavior:\n*[[Compressibility factor|Compressibility effects]] (''Z'' allowed to vary from 1.0)\n*Variable [[heat capacity]] (specific heats vary with temperature)\n*Van der Waals forces (related to compressibility, can substitute other equations of state)\n*[[Non-equilibrium thermodynamics|Non-equilibrium thermodynamic effects]]\n*Issues with molecular [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] and [[elementary reaction]]s with variable composition.\n\nFor most applications, such a detailed analysis is excessive. Examples where real gas effects would have a significant impact would be on the [[Space Shuttle]] [[Atmospheric reentry|re-entry]] where extremely high temperatures and pressures were present or the gases produced during geological events as in the image of the 1990 eruption of [[Mount Redoubt]].\n\n==Historical research==\n{{see also|Gas laws}}\n\n===Boyle's law===\n[[File:Boyle air pump.jpg|right|thumb|border|text-top|upright|Boyle's equipment]]\n{{Main|Boyle's law}}\nBoyle's law was perhaps the first expression of an equation of state. In 1662 [[Robert Boyle]] performed a series of experiments employing a J-shaped glass tube, which was sealed on one end. Mercury was added to the tube, trapping a fixed quantity of air in the short, sealed end of the tube. Then the volume of gas was carefully measured as additional mercury was added to the tube. The pressure of the gas could be determined by the difference between the mercury level in the short end of the tube and that in the long, open end. The image of Boyle's equipment shows some of the exotic tools used by Boyle during his study of gases.\n\nThrough these experiments, Boyle noted that the pressure exerted by a gas held at a constant temperature varies inversely with the volume of the gas.<ref>McPherson, pp.52\u201355</ref>  For example, if the volume is halved, the pressure is doubled; and if the volume is doubled, the pressure is halved. Given the inverse relationship between pressure and volume, the product of pressure (''P'') and volume (''V'') is a constant (''k'') for a given mass of confined gas as long as the temperature is constant. Stated as a formula, thus is:\n\n:<math> PV = k </math>\n\nBecause the before and after volumes and pressures of the fixed amount of gas, where the before and after temperatures are the same both equal the constant ''k'', they can be related by the equation:\n\n<math>\\qquad P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2.</math>\n\n=== Charles's law ===\n{{Main|Charles's law}}\nIn 1787, the French physicist and balloon pioneer, [[Jacques Charles]], found that oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and air expand to the same extent over the same 80 kelvin interval. He noted that, for an ideal gas at constant pressure, the volume is directly proportional to its temperature:\n\n: <math>\\frac{V_1}{T_1} = \\frac{V_2}{T_2}</math>\n\n===Gay-Lussac's law===\n{{Main|Gay-Lussac's law}}\nIn 1802, [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] published results of similar, though more extensive experiments.<ref>McPherson, pp.55\u201360</ref> Gay-Lussac credited Charles' earlier work by naming the law in his honor. Gay-Lussac himself is credited with the law describing pressure, which he found in 1809. It states that the pressure exerted on a container's sides by an ideal gas is proportional to its temperature.\n:<math> \\frac{P_1}{T_1}=\\frac{P_2}{T_2}    \\,</math>\n\n===Avogadro's law===\n{{Main|Avogadro's law}}\nIn 1811, Amedeo Avogadro verified that equal volumes of pure gases contain the same number of particles. His theory was not generally accepted until 1858 when another Italian chemist Stanislao Cannizzaro was able to explain non-ideal exceptions. For his work with gases a century prior, the number that bears his name [[Avogadro's constant]] represents the number of atoms found in 12&nbsp;grams of elemental carbon-12 (6.022\u00d710<sup>23</sup> mol<sup>\u22121</sup>). This specific number of gas particles, at standard temperature and pressure (ideal gas law) occupies 22.40 liters, which is referred to as the [[molar volume]].\n\nAvogadro's law states that the volume occupied by an ideal gas is proportional to the number of [[mole (unit)|moles]] (or molecules) present in the container. This gives rise to the [[molar volume]] of a gas, which at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|STP]] is 22.4 dm<sup>3</sup> (or litres). The relation is given by\n\n:<math>\\frac{V_1}{n_1}=\\frac{V_2}{n_2}    \\,</math>\n\nwhere n is equal to the number of moles of gas (the number of molecules divided by [[Avogadro's number]]).\n\n===Dalton's law===\n[[File:Daltons symbols.gif|thumb|border|text-top|[[John Dalton|Dalton]]'s notation.]]\n\n{{Main|Dalton's law}}\nIn 1801, [[John Dalton]] published the law of partial pressures from his work with ideal gas law relationship: The pressure of a mixture of non reactive gases is equal to the sum of the pressures of all of the constituent gases alone. Mathematically, this can be represented for ''n'' species as:\n\n: '''Pressure<sub>total</sub> = Pressure<sub>1</sub> + Pressure<sub>2</sub> + ... + Pressure<sub>''n''</sub>'''\n\nThe image of Dalton's journal depicts symbology he used as shorthand to record the path he followed. Among his key journal observations upon mixing unreactive \"elastic fluids\" (gases) were the following:<ref>{{cite book |pages=72, 77\u201378 |author=John P. Millington |title=John Dalton |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.30924 |date=1906}}</ref>\n*Unlike liquids, heavier gases did not drift to the bottom upon mixing.\n*Gas particle identity played no role in determining final pressure (they behaved as if their size was negligible).\n\n==Special topics==\n\n===Compressibility===\n[[File:Compressibility Factor of Air 75-200 K.png|right|thumb|border|text-top|Compressibility factors for air.]]\n{{Main|Compressibility factor}}\nThermodynamicists use this factor (''Z'') to alter the ideal gas equation to account for compressibility effects of real gases. This factor represents the ratio of actual to ideal specific volumes. It is sometimes referred to as a \"fudge-factor\" or correction to expand the useful range of the ideal gas law for design purposes. ''Usually'' this ''Z'' value is very close to unity. The compressibility factor image illustrates how Z varies over a range of very cold temperatures.\n\n===Reynolds number===\n{{Main|Reynolds number}}\nIn fluid mechanics, the Reynolds number is the ratio of inertial forces (''v<sub>s</sub>\u03c1'') to viscous forces (''\u03bc/L''). It is one of the most important dimensionless numbers in fluid dynamics and is used, usually along with other dimensionless numbers, to provide a criterion for determining dynamic similitude. As such, the Reynolds number provides the link between modeling results (design) and the full-scale actual conditions. It can also be used to characterize the flow.\n\n===Viscosity===\n[[File:Vortex-street-1.jpg|thumb|upright|Satellite view of weather pattern in vicinity of [[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands|Robinson Crusoe Islands]] on 15 September 1999, shows a turbulent cloud pattern called a [[K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortex street]]]]\n{{Main|Viscosity}}\nViscosity, a physical property, is a measure of how well adjacent molecules stick to one another. A solid can withstand a shearing force due to the strength of these sticky intermolecular forces. A fluid will continuously deform when subjected to a similar load. While a gas has a lower value of viscosity than a liquid, it is still an observable property. If gases had no viscosity, then they would not stick to the surface of a wing and form a boundary layer. A study of the [[delta wing]] in the [[Schlieren photography|Schlieren]] image reveals that the gas particles stick to one another (see Boundary layer section).\n\n===Turbulence===\n[[File:Schlierenfoto Mach 17 Delta - NASA.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Delta wing]] in wind tunnel. The shadows form as the indices of refraction change within the gas as it compresses on the leading edge of this wing.]]\n{{Main|Turbulence}}\nIn fluid dynamics, turbulence or turbulent flow is a flow regime characterized by chaotic, stochastic property changes. This includes low momentum diffusion, high momentum convection, and rapid variation of pressure and velocity in space and time. The satellite view of weather around Robinson Crusoe Islands illustrates one example.\n\n===Boundary layer===\n{{Main|Boundary layer}}\nParticles will, in effect, \"stick\" to the surface of an object moving through it. This layer of particles is called the boundary layer. At the surface of the object, it is essentially static due to the friction of the surface. The object, with its boundary layer is effectively the new shape of the object that the rest of the molecules \"see\" as the object approaches. This boundary layer can separate from the surface, essentially creating a new surface and completely changing the flow path. The classical example of this is a [[Stall (flight)#Formal definition|stalling airfoil]]. The delta wing image clearly shows the boundary layer thickening as the gas flows from right to left along the leading edge.\n\n===Maximum entropy principle===\n{{Main|Principle of maximum entropy}}\nAs the total number of degrees of freedom approaches infinity, the system will be found in the [[macrostate]] that corresponds to the highest [[multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]]. In order to illustrate this principle, observe the skin temperature of a frozen metal bar. Using a thermal image of the skin temperature, note the temperature distribution on the surface. This initial observation of temperature represents a \"[[microstate]]\". At some future time, a second observation of the skin temperature produces a second microstate. By continuing this observation process, it is possible to produce a series of microstates that illustrate the thermal history of the bar's surface. Characterization of this historical series of microstates is possible by choosing the macrostate that successfully classifies them all into a single grouping.\n\n===Thermodynamic equilibrium===\n{{Main|Thermodynamic equilibrium}}\nWhen energy transfer ceases from a system, this condition is referred to as thermodynamic equilibrium. Usually, this condition implies the system and surroundings are at the same temperature so that heat no longer transfers between them. It also implies that external forces are balanced (volume does not change), and all chemical reactions within the system are complete. The timeline varies for these events depending on the system in question. A container of ice allowed to melt at room temperature takes hours, while in semiconductors the heat transfer that occurs in the device transition from an on to off state could be on the order of a few nanoseconds.\n\n===Effect on state sovereignty===\n{{Main|Sovereignty}}\nIncreased anthropogenic gaseous emissions diminish state sovereignty because states cannot protect their citizens from the effects of other states' emissions.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Habib |first1=Benjamin |title=Climate Change and the Re-imagination of State Sovereignty |url=https://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/blog/19/04/2016/climate-change-and-re-imagination-state-sovereignty |website=Global Policy Journal |publisher=Durham University |accessdate=20 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Greenhouse gas]]\n*[[List of gases]]\n*[[Natural gas]]\n*[[Volcanic gas]]\n*[[Breathing gas]]\n*[[Wind]]\n{{Table_of_phase_transitions}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book |author=Anderson, John D. |authorlink=John D.

Schlert. Bishop Schlert is the first priest ordained for the Diocese of Allentown to be appointed Bishop of the Diocese. \u00a0He was ordained a Bishop and installed as Bishop of Allentown on August 31, 2017.\n\nCatholics form the largest single religious group in the five counties of the Diocese. In the 83 parishes of the Diocese, there are more than 252,000 registered Catholics, representing more than 20 percent of the general population.\n\n== Statistics and extent ==\nThe diocese covers the [[Pennsylvania]] counties of [[Berks County, Pennsylvania|Berks]], [[Carbon County, Pennsylvania|Carbon]], [[Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Lehigh]], [[Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Northampton]] and [[Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania|Schuylkill]].

Welsh established the first Youth Ministry Office in the diocese and raised $13 million in an endowment campaign for diocesan schools and other educational efforts.

In 2008, Cullen, under the direction of the Metropolitan Archbishop Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua, carried out a program to restructure many of the parishes in the Diocese. As part of this program, 47 parishes were closed; this reduced the number of parishes from 151 to 104.

After an altercation in which he killed [[Sheriff]] W.T.(Brack) Morris, Cortez went on the run from the Texas Rangers for thirteen days. He became the target of the largest manhunt in U.S. history from June 14, 1901 to June 22, 1901. He was accused of murdering two sheriffs and finally convicted of horse theft.<ref>{{harvnb|Alvear|2006|page= 1}}</ref>\n\nCelebrated by fellow Mexican-Americans for his ability to evade the authorities, as well as his impassioned words in court, Cortez's life was converted into a [[legend]] by people on the [[Rio Grande]] border.<ref name=\"rodriguez\">{{harvnb|Rodr\u00edguez}}</ref> This legend, which took shape in a popular song, the \"Corrido de Gregorio Cortez,\" dramatized Cortez's fight against the authorities and transformed him into an inspiration for the [[Mexican-American border]] communities. This [[corrido]] (or [[border ballad]]), sung at local cantinas, resonated with its listeners, and ignited pride in one's way of life on the border. The conversion of Cortez into myth was analyzed by [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]] in his book ''With His Pistol in His Hand'', which examines the many versions of this corrido as well as the story's historical basis in order to understand how an average man such as Gregorio Cortez was canonized into a folkloric hero inspiring the border resident. Cortez's story was also depicted in the movie ''[[The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez]]'', starring [[Edward James Olmos]].\n\n==Background==\n\nTexas was part of newly independent Mexico from 1821 until 1836 when it declared its independence. The annexation by the United States was approved by the congresses of Texas and the United States in 1845, and the transfer of authority from the republic to the state of Texas took place in 1846. However, Mexico's rejection of this annexation and a disagreement over the location of the new border, namely, a dispute over the area comprised between [[the Rio Grande]] and the [[Nueces River]], led to the [[Mexican-American War]]. In the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], signed on February 2, 1848, Mexico gave up its claim to [[Texas]] and the new border between Mexico and The United States was settled along the [[Rio Grande]].<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|2003|page= ??}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. annexation brought land loss and limitations to political access for Tejanos. The [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] promised American citizenship to residents who wanted to stay in Texas, but Tejanos in the lower Rio Grande Valley were relegated to second-class status. Also, while it provided that the property rights of Mexican subjects would be maintained inviolable, these rights were later challenged by the United States authorities. <ref name= Valerio-Jimenez2012> Valerio-Jim\u00e9nez, Omar S., and e-Duke Books Scholarly Collection 2012.

On the one hand, the Texas Rangers were portrayed as heroic figures protecting settlers from Indian raids and Mexican banditry. On the other hand, they have been described as the main tool of [[Anglo]] expansion on lands formerly occupied by Mexicans and Native Americans.<ref>{{harvnb|Weiss Jr|2012|page= 41}}</ref> To move beyond this dichotomy, historian Robert M. Utley exposes the complex nature of the relationship between the [[Mexican Americans]] and the Texas Rangers. While some rangers may have been \"ruthless, brutal and more lawless than the criminals they were prosecuting,\" he argues that there is no systematic evidence of persecution of Mexican-Americans by this police force <ref>Utley, page xii</ref>.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nGregorio Cortez Lira was born in the state of [[Tamaulipas]], [[Mexico]]<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>, near the U.S.-Mexico border, the son of Roman Cortez Garza, a rancher, and Rosalia Lira Cortinas. Cortez and his first wife divorced in 1903, and in 1905 he married Estefana Garza<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>. They had no children and later separated.<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>\n\nIn 1887, his family moved to [[Manor, Texas]] near [[Austin]]. Two years later, Cortez joined his older brother, Romaldo Cortez, in finding seasonal employment on the farms and ranches of South Texas. Sometime in this period, Cortez married Leonor D\u00edaz; they had four children. After eleven years as ''vaqueros'', or cowboys, and farmhands, Cortez and his brother settled on a farm in [[Karnes County]], renting land from a local rancher. It is known that he spoke [[English language|English]] and owned horses.<ref name=\"orozco\" />\n\nAt the time that Cortez and his family had immigrated to South Texas, [[Anglo]]s had also begun to penetrate the region in increasing numbers, particularly with the arrival of the railroad. As political and economic power shifted to the newcomers, most Mexican Americans, like Cortez, lived as hired agricultural workers or as tenant farmers. Class and ethnicity relegated them to the bottom of a discriminatory Anglo-dominated Texas society.<ref name= \"jastrzembski\">{{harvnb|Jastrzembski|2000}}</ref>\n\n== Adventure of Cortez ==\n\n=== Incident ===\nThe visit to Cortez followed their interrogation of Villareal in connection with a reported [[horse theft]]. Villareal had already acknowledged his recent trade of a horse for a [[mare]] belonging to Gregorio Cortez. And it was exactly this distinction made in Spanish, between a male horse (''caballo'') and a female horse or mare (''yegua''), that Choate misunderstood when questioning Gregorio. The latter answered negatively when asked on behalf of the Sheriff whether he had recently traded for a horse. For, in truth, he had traded a mare.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nCourt records show that the killings of Romaldo (also known as Rom\u00e1n) Cortez, Gregorio's brother, and [[Sheriff]] W.T. (Brack) Morris were related to the subject of a horse trade.<ref name=\"sorell154\">{{harvnb|Sorell|1983|page=154}}</ref> Morris arrived accompanied by one of his [[deputies]], Boone Choate, who could speak Spanish and would thus serve as an interpreter.<ref name=\"sorell154\">{{harvnb|Sorell|1983|page=154}}</ref>\n\nInterpreting the response as a lie, the Sheriff made clear his intention to arrest the Cortez brothers. More words were exchanged and a gun battle followed. The sheriff was the first to draw a pistol despite the suspicion on his part that both Cortezes were probably unarmed. Gregorio killed Sheriff Morris in [[self-defense]] after the Sheriff had fired repeatedly on his brother Romaldo who, thinking that Gregorio was unarmed, ran at the Sheriff trying to protect Gregorio.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nThe Sheriff shot Romaldo and he fell away from the door. And then Gregorio Cortez stood at the door with his pistol in his hand. The Major Sheriff fell dead at the feet of Gregorio Cortez, and it was in this way that Gregorio Cortez killed the first sheriff of many that he was to kill.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 40}}</ref>\nThe killing occurred on June 14, 1901.<ref name= TexasAppeals />\n\n=== Escape to the Robledo ranch ===\n\nAfter the run-in with [[Sheriff]] Morris and [[Sheriffs in the United States|Deputy]] Boone, Cortez wanted to take his injured brother to the closest town, [[Kenedy, Texas]], for medical assistance about 10 miles away. Both on [[horseback]], Cortez and his brother, Romaldo, struggled on their journey as Romaldo was severely hurt and kept falling off his horse. However, Gregorio eventually reached [[Kenedy, Texas|Kenedy,]] left Romaldo in town to be taken care of, and began his flight from the authorities.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 66}}</ref> \n\nAs officers thought Cortez would be heading south to the border to escape, he decided to head north instead to confuse his pursuers. <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" /> He traveled 55 miles from [[Kenedy, Texas|Kenedy]] to [[Belmont, Texas|Belmont]] in hopes of hiding at the house of his friend, Mart\u00edn Robledo. After spending a couple of days at the Robledo ranch, authorities discovered Cortez's whereabouts and thus begun the Battle of Belmont.\n\n=== Battle of Belmont ===\nAfter escaping, Cortez went to the ranch of Mart\u00edn and Refugia Robledo near [[Belmont, Texas]]. There were seven persons at the Robledo house. Mart\u00edn and Refugia Robledo, their three sons, Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez (a boy living with the Robledos) and a visitor, Mart\u00edn Sandoval. Gonzales County Sheriff Robert M. Glover, a friend of Sheriff Morris, knew where Cortez was hiding, probably from information obtained under duress. This information would have been either provided by Cortez's mother, wife or sister-in-law as they were the only people who knew where Cortez was going.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= ??}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals report of facts, on June 15, 1904, at the time Sheriff Morris was killed, Sheriff Glover was in [[Cuero]], [[DeWitt County, Texas]]. Glover proceeded with a [[deputy sheriff]] of De Witt County to Kennedy, in [[Karnes County]], and there for the first time learned that Cortez was the man who had killed Sheriff Morris. Glover, knowing the rendezvous of Cortez, boarded a train in about twenty minutes after receiving the information that Cortez had done the killing and proceeded as expeditiously as he could to the town of Ottine, in Gonzales County; there secured horses, and accompanied by two deputy sheriffs of [[Gonzales County]], including Deputy Swift, and other parties, went a few miles in the country to the Schnable ranch; and there learned that Cortez was at the home of Martin Roblero. He and his posse went to Roblero's. The posse divided as they approached the house from the north side; Glover and one or more companions going on the east side of the house around to the south side; and the other parties going on the west side around to the south side of the house. According to the Court, Some of the testimony tends to show that the sheriff's posse shot first; but the preponderance of the evidence shows that Cortez and Bonafacio fired the first shot. Just before the time that the sheriff's posse arrived at the house, Cortez informed Bonafacio that the Sheriff's troop would be on his tail and asked him what he should do, whether to fight or surrender. Bonafacio would have said, \"We will fight\". Immediately upon Glover getting around to a point opposite the gallery on the south side of the house, Cortez and Bonafacio Roblero (the Roblero's eldest son), who were in the gallery, allegedly fired upon Glover and killed him. There was a general fusillade of shots on the part of the posse and Cortez and Bonafacio. On the other hand, in his testimony, Cortez asserts that the officers came up and immediately fired upon him; that he returned this fire. <ref name= TexasAppeals />\n\nThe San-Antonio Express called the Battle of Belmont, as it came to be known, \u201ca tale of bravery unsurpassed on the part of the officers and of desperation on the part of the Mexicans.\u201d. According to this version of the story, Cortez was waiting in ambush, and as Sheriff Glover and Posseman Schnabel approached, he opened fire. Sheriff Glover and Posseman Schnabel were killed <ref>San Antonio Express, June 16, 1901</ref>\n\nThe actual story, according to the scholar [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]], was less heroic. Just hours after Cortez arrived at the ranch, Glover and his posse had surrounded the house and began to attack. Cortez fired at Glover who fell dead before running into the brush behind the house to hide. Robledo, his eldest son, and Sandoval were involved in the shooting, while Robledo's wife, his two younger sons and Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez stayed unarmed inside the house. Shots were exchanged and Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez was wounded, as well as Robledo\u2019s wife. Another member of the posse shot and killed accidentally his companion, Henry Schnabel. In the end, the posse captured five of the Mexicans, including the two wounded. Cortez, however, escaped.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= ??}}</ref>\n\n=== Flight ===\n\nAfter narrowly escaping the [[Mexican standoff|standoff]] on the Robledo [[ranch]], Cortez \"walked directly south to the [[Bank (geography)|banks]] of the [[Guadalupe River (Texas)|Guadalupe River]] [...] to another friend, Ceferino Flores.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 72}}</ref> Flores gave Cortez a horse and saddle to continue his journey. Cortez would frequently ride in circles and create paths in different directions to throw off the authorities. After days of travel, the [[mare]] grew weary and dropped dead. Soon saddling another small horse, Cortez continued south, just outside of [[Floresville, Texas|Floresville,]] close to [[Cotulla]]. Though Cortez succeeded in creating disorientating routes for officers to follow, he traveled close to the Corpus Christi-to-Laredo [[railroad]] and made it evident that he was moving toward [[Laredo\u2013Nuevo Laredo|Laredo]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> As the law was close behind him, Cortez took risks; having his newfound horse jump over sharp wire fences or pretending he was a [[cattle]] [[herder]]. But on June 20, as the mare could not continue, Cortez left the horse and snuck into [[Cotulla]] and received food and new clothes from locals. Cortez did not have a horse and was essentially surrounded by authorities. However, he went unnoticed, authorities believed he had acquired yet another horse, and that their only chance of catching Cortez would be by accident. Over his 10 day journey, Cortez had ridden three horses, traveled over 500 hundred miles, and had seemingly blended in with the townspeople of [[Cotulla]] <ref name= SanAntonio2016> [https://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/commentary/article/Gregorio-Cortez-the-myth-and-the-man-7420445.php L\u00f3pez, Jos\u00e9 A. \"Gregorio Cortez, the myth and the man.\" ''San Antonio Express-News,'' 7 May 2016.] </ref>.\n\nDuring those 10 days, Cortez was pursued by a posse that at times included up to 300 men. He traveled nearly 400 miles on horseback and more than 100 miles on foot. His story was symbolic of the struggles between the [[Anglo-Americans]] and [[Mexican Americans]] in [[South Texas]].<ref>Afterword by Bill Crider. Elmer Kelton. ''Manhunters''. Texas Christian University Press, 1994</ref>\n\n=== Capture ===\n\nGregorio managed to elude hundreds of men in parties of up to three hundred by riding four hundred miles on mares and walking at least 120 miles along the [[Mexico-Texas border]] before ultimately being captured on June 22.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nSuspecting Gregorio\u2019s presence nearby, Glover and eight other Rangers approached the Martin Robledo home at dawn after drinking a bottle of whiskey together. He divided his posse to the east and west sides to surround the house. With the confusion from the alcohol and darkness of night, the shooting began as Glover reached the southeast corner of the home. Glover and Gregorio fired at each other until Glover fell dead from his horse. With two lawmen dead, an extensive manhunt began for Gregorio. The [[Texas Ranger Division]] became involved when the sheriff of [[Atascosa County]] and Ranger Robert M. Glover were shot on the Thulemeyer ranch. \n\nFrom June 15 to June 25, 1901, the story was front-page news of the [[Daily Express]]. Through the newspaper, Cortez, a lone Mexican vaquero, was transformed into a dynamic leader of well-organized thieves. While the [[Euro-American]] public viewed Cortez as a guilty Mexican, Mexican-Americans transformed Cortez into a heroic figure that could outrun the renowned Texas Rangers, and stand up to his oppressors.<ref>Alvear, 28</ref>\n\n== Trials ==\n=== Court proceedings ===\n\n==== Supporters ====\n\nAfter the capture of Cortez, before court proceedings would begin, [[Mexican-Americans]] across the country started a defense fund for Cortez, saying that without the support it would be impossible for him to get a fair trial <ref name= GarberCourts />. The amount of money raised is unknown, however, the fund was largely advertised by a newspaper publisher, Pablo Cruz, and the Sociedad Trabajador Miguel Hidalgo in [[San Antonio]] and saw donations flood in from rich landowners and even local \"rancheros\".<ref name=\"orozco\" /> Though Cortez's support was mainly from those of Mexican descent, some [[Anglo-Americans]] admired his \"intellect, wisdom and ingenuity <ref name= SanAntonio2016 />. Some prominent Anglo-Texans aiding Cortez were then [[Texas Secretary of State]], F.C. Weinert, and [[defense lawyer]], R.B Abernathy, who Cortez remembered as one of his most vital attorneys, defending him for over four years <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />.\n\n==== Gonzales trial ====\nThe first of Cortez's trials began on July 24, 1901, in [[Gonzales, Texas]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> Though many [[Mexicans]] were vocal about and attended the [[trial]] in Gonzales, the [[jury]] consisted of eleven [[Anglo-Americans]] and one [[African-American]]. At Gonzales, \"a gallery full of lawmen filled the courtroom\" <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" /> and wanted to see Cortez sentenced. The [[prosecution]] tried Cortez for the murder of [[Constable]] Schnabel, one of the men killed at the Battle of Belmont (see above) <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" />. The prosecution had originally claimed the murder to have been done by Mrs. Robledo during the fight, but they shifted the blame to Cortez and told Robledo to testify that she had seen Cortez shoot and kill both Schnabel and Glover<ref name= Algren1997>Algren, Nelson. ''The Last Carousel''. New York, Seven Stories Press, 1997. </ref>. Another [[witness]], Manuel Tom, strengthened the claim, saying that Cortez had confessed to him about killing the two men near a [[barn]] where Robledo described. However, when asked what was the Spanish word for barn (granero) the best Tom could do was say ''casa'', the word for house <ref name= CortezAppeals1902> [https://law.jrank.org/pages/2731/Gregorio-Cortez-Appeals-1902-04-Appeals-Challenge-Convictions.html Gregorio Cortez Appeals: 1902-04 Appeals Challenge Convictions.]</ref>. The trial swayed all jurors, besides an A.L Sanders who believed Cortez to be innocent. However, as a family member of Sanders's soon developed a serious illness and the juror needed to return home. Sanders succumbed to the jury's pressure and agreed with the others that Cortez was guilty; ultimately sentencing Cortez to 50 years in prison for [[second-degree murder]] <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />. Though Sanders later told the defense he voted \"guilty\" to be there for his sick family member and the attorneys motioned for a new trial, however, their plea was struck down and Sanders was fined $100 for [[contempt of court]].<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 91}}</ref>\n\nMany local officers were enraged about the [[verdict]] as they wanted to see Cortez face the [[death penalty]]. A few months later, as Cortez was in a Gonzales jail, over 300 men arranged a [[lynching]] of the recently sentenced prisoner <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2)> [https://law.jrank.org/pages/2733/Gregorio-Cortez-Appeals-1902-04.html Gregorio Cortez Appeals: 1902-04 Convictions Upheld In Glover Shooting] </ref>. The hate-filled attempts were unsuccessful, but tensions grew further as soon thereafter, on January 15, 1902, the [[Texas Court of Criminal Appeals]] reversed Cortez's sentence <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" />. The appeal was upheld as the court doubted that Cortez could have murdered both officers within quick succession, as he would have been in two places at the same time, and denied Manuel Tom's crude translation of the word ''barn'' <ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />. The Gonzales Trial was ultimately a win for Cortez and his defense team, as he would not be tried for the murder of Schnabel again. However, the prosecution backed by the rage of local police forces continued working to see Cortez serve life behind bars or be sentenced to death.\n\n==== Further legal battles ====\nThough Cortez's sentence for the killing of Schnabel was reversed in early 1902 <ref name=GarberCourts> Garber, Margorie B.; Matlock, Jann; Walkowitz, Rebecca (1993). Media Spectacles. New York: Routledge. pp. 91\u2013116.</ref>, Cortez had faced a previous trial from Oct 7-11, 1901 in [[Karnes City, Texas]] and was sentenced to death for the murder of Sherrif Morris <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />. At this trial, \"the families of both Morris and Glover were sat in the front row, where the prosecution could point them out to the jury.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 92}}</ref> However, eight months after the Karnes verdict, the [[Court of Criminal Appeals]] reversed the sentence on the grounds of [[prejudice]] <ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />. Legal proceedings transferred to [[Pleasanton, Texas]] where a rushed decision emprisoned Cortez for two years for [[horse theft]]. The court ruling was soon reversed.<ref>Brown 146</ref>\n\nThe criminalization of Cortez continued to [[Goliad, Texas]] where the jury could not agree on a sentence for Cortez with \"seven for first-degree murder, four for second-degree murder, and one for acquittal.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 93}}</ref> The trials soon went to [[Wharton County]], where it was dismissed almost immediately, and then to Corpus Christi where Cortez was tried April 25-30, 1904. The jury, consisting of twelve white farmers, found Cortez not guilty for the killing of Morris, as they understood he acted in [[self-defense]].<ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />\n\nHowever, there was no celebration of the [[acquittal]], as soon thereafter, a court in [[Columbus, Texas]] found Cortez guilty for the murder of Sheriff Glover and sentenced him to life in prison <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />. Though the defense was optimistic about their [[appeal]] being upheld, Cortez's lawyers had built a case saying that Cortez had not fired shots anywhere near Glover in the Battle of Belmont which many witnesses denied.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 94}}</ref>. The [[Court of Criminal Appeals]] soon upheld the [[conviction]], and on Jan 1, 1905, Gregorio Cortez began his [[life sentence]] in the [[Huntsville Penitentiary]] for the murder of Sheriff Glover.<ref name= TexasAppeals>[https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/4148411/cortez-v-state/ Cortez v. State, 83 S.W. 812 (Tex. Crim. App. 1904)] </ref>\n\n=== Prison and pardon ===\nCortez was sentenced not for the death of Morris (which sparked the entire escapade), but for his alleged murder of Sheriff Robert M. Glover, who was killed during the pursuit. Efforts to have Cortez pardoned began with his incarceration and finally succeeded in 1913 when Governor [[Oscar Branch Colquitt|Oscar Colquitt]] issued him a conditional [[pardon]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> He was freed on July 14 of that year.\n\n== Post-prison life and death ==\n\nAfter his pardon in 1913, Cortez thanked those who helped secure his freedom, spent his later years in [[Nuevo Laredo, Mexico]], and joined the losing [[Victoriano Huerta|Huertist]] forces of the [[Mexican Revolution]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> After being wounded in the war, Cortez began living with one of his sons in [[Manor, Texas]] then later resided in [[Anson, Texas]].<ref>Brown, 150</ref><ref name= Deutsch2012>[https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/19510/cfch_Deutsch_GregorioCortez.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y Deutsch, James I. 2012. \"Gregorio Cortez.\" in Great Lives from History: Latinos.]</ref>. Then on February 28, 1916, having been recently married for the third time to an assumed Esther Mart\u00ednez, Cortez died suddenly at the age of 40.<ref name=\"orozco\" /><ref name=\"jastrzembski\" />\n\nTo this day, the [[cause of death]] of Cortez is contested.

In [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]]'s book, ''With His Pistol in His Hand'', he recites eleven versions of ''El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez'' each sung by numerous ''guitarreros'' (guitarists) near the [[Mexican-American border]].<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 175}}</ref> Though each [[corrido]] had their own style, flair, or message wanting to be relayed, they all exaggerated the life of Cortez to transform him into a Mexican [[folk hero]].\n\n=== With His Pistol in His Hand ===\n\nThe life and legend of Gregorio Cortez were studied by the scholar [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]] in a doctoral thesis on corridos that was later published in a revised version by the University of Texas Press in 1958 under the title ''With His Pistol in His Hand''.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016}}</ref> Paredes's work is about the life of Cortez, his legend, the formal aspects and variants of the corrido, and the cultural significance reflected in these products. \n\nThe book is one of the most influential books in  [[Chicano]] cultural studies and has received wide recognition and outstanding success in the academic world.<ref>Lopez Mor\u00edn, Jos\u00e9 R., and Project Muse University Press Archival eBooks.

''Am\u00e9rico Paredes.'']</ref>. The particularity of the work is that it constitutes a hybrid of genres. The first chapter and the third chapters are historical. In the first one, he retraces the social and political background of the former Spanish province of [[Nuevo Santander]] to explain the origin of ethnic tensions. In the third chapter, through extensive corpus sources (judicial reports, newspapers, and testimonies) he reconstructs in detail the whole life of Cortez. The second chapter could be classified as a study of regional folklore because he describes \"an idealized and formalized version of the legend.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 108}}</ref> In the second part of the book \"El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez, a Ballad of Border Conflict,\u201d Paredes provides a study of the narrative form of the corrido.

It was directed by [[Robert M. Young (director)|Robert Young]], and based on Paredes's  ''With His Pistol in His Hand''.<ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.p 64</ref>. The film deals with the creation of the myth as well as the reconstruction of the historical reality of the life and adventure of Gregorio Cortez.<ref>{{harvnb|Elitzik|1984|page= 38}}</ref>\n\nThe film is classified as a Western, but it is different from other films of the genre due to its historical realism. While classic elements of a western are present in the film such as horse racing, a lynch mob, a heroic sheriff and the vast desert space of Texas, the film's authenticity is a profound departure from this genre <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.P64</ref> <ref>Sunness, page 40</ref> The magazine ''Cin\u00e9aste'' described the film as \"the true history of the West\".<ref>Sunness, page 40</ref> and the movie has been considered the most authentic Westerns in the history of American cinema by the United States Historical Society <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.p64</ref>. This sense of authenticity is due in part to the documentary-style used by the director to tell the life of Gregorio Cortez, but also to the choice made by Villasenor to develop the point of view of the people involved in the story, regardless of their ethnicity, thus presenting real historical characters and not the stereotypes of a myth. This process makes it possible to represent the hostility between communities in South Texas and the violation of the land rights of Mexican Americans by Texas Rangers or lynch mobs <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018. p65</ref>. On the other hand, through this process, the scriptwriters were able to highlight the origins of the myth as well as the stages of its construction. The myth is presented as an episode in the history of the conflict between the Anglo-Americans and The Mexican-Americans.<ref>Sunness, page 40</ref>\n\nIn an interview, the film's director, [[Robert M. Young (director)|Robert Young]], suggested that he wanted to represent the different interpretations surrounding life and legend. He declared \"I thought the important thing was, first, to tell a story that wasn't linear- I don't believe in those kinds of stories, things are always more complicated - and then to deal with the differing interpretations.\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref> Young wanted to represent the fantasies created by the two ethnic groups, namely the exaggeration of Cortez's exploits for the Mexicans and the belief that Cortez was at the head of an entire gang for the Anglos. He declared to the Cin\u00e9aste that he \" tried to take the audience into the story so they would make the same mistakes as the Anglos and, later, when they find out what happened, they wouldn't feel superior to the Anglo characters but realize that they'd made the same error\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref>.\n\nIf racism is portrayed throughout the film, the director downplays it. It was a deliberate choice to keep the humanity of the characters and to denounce it more vigorously. According to Young, \"The people who perpetuate the racism are people, too, they're human.

After an altercation in which he killed [[Sheriff]] W.T.(Brack) Morris, Cortez went on the run from the Texas Rangers for thirteen days. He became the target of the largest manhunt in U.S. history from June 14, 1901 to June 22, 1901. He was accused of murdering two sheriffs and finally convicted of horse theft.<ref>{{harvnb|Alvear|2006|page= 1}}</ref>\n\nCelebrated by fellow Mexican-Americans for his ability to evade the authorities, as well as his impassioned words in court, Cortez's life was converted into a [[legend]] by people on the [[Rio Grande]] border.<ref name=\"rodriguez\">{{harvnb|Rodr\u00edguez}}</ref> This legend, which took shape in a popular song, the \"Corrido de Gregorio Cortez,\" dramatized Cortez's fight against the authorities and transformed him into an inspiration for the [[Mexican-American border]] communities. This [[corrido]] (or [[border ballad]]), sung at local cantinas, resonated with its listeners, and ignited pride in one's way of life on the border. The conversion of Cortez into myth was analyzed by [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]] in his book ''With His Pistol in His Hand'', which examines the many versions of this corrido as well as the story's historical basis in order to understand how an average man such as Gregorio Cortez was canonized into a folkloric hero inspiring the border resident. Cortez's story was also depicted in the movie ''[[The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez]]'', starring [[Edward James Olmos]].\n\n==Background==\n\nTexas was part of newly independent Mexico from 1821 until 1836 when it declared its independence. The annexation by the United States was approved by the congresses of Texas and the United States in 1845, and the transfer of authority from the republic to the state of Texas took place in 1846. However, Mexico's rejection of this annexation and a disagreement over the location of the new border, namely, a dispute over the area comprised between [[the Rio Grande]] and the [[Nueces River]], led to the [[Mexican-American War]]. In the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], signed on February 2, 1848, Mexico gave up its claim to [[Texas]] and the new border between Mexico and The United States was settled along the [[Rio Grande]].<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|2003|page= ??}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. annexation brought land loss and limitations to political access for Tejanos. The [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] promised American citizenship to residents who wanted to stay in Texas, but Tejanos in the lower Rio Grande Valley were relegated to second-class status. Also, while it provided that the property rights of Mexican subjects would be maintained inviolable, these rights were later challenged by the United States authorities. <ref name= Valerio-Jimenez2012> Valerio-Jim\u00e9nez, Omar S., and e-Duke Books Scholarly Collection 2012.

Indeed, cultural, ethnic, and religious differences between Anglos and Hispanics persisted in the decades after the Mexican War.<ref>{{harvnb|Weiss Jr|2012|page= 36}}</ref> Although the episodes of ethnic violence were episodic,<ref>{{harvnb|Alonzo|1998|page= 133}}</ref> the historian Alonzo argues that \"Anglo superiority also served to rationalize the very common idea in Texas that it is no wrong to kill a Mexican and, worse still, that killing an ethnic Mexican was an act to be proud of.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Alonzo|1998|page= 134}}</ref>\n\nIn his book about Gregorio Cortez's life, Am\u00e9rico Paredes highlights the role of the Texas Rangers division in exacerbating the cultural conflicts on the border due to their alleged violent methods.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|pages= 23-32}}</ref>. An antagonistic relationship between [[Anglo-Americans]] and [[Mexican-Americans]] has developed in Texas due to a cycle of revenge involving Bandit Gang, Texas Rangers and innocent [[Mexican-Americans]] collaterals victims.<ref>{{harvnb|Levario|2012|page= 18}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Alonzo|1998|page= 132}}</ref> However, the role of the Texas Rangers in discrimination is a subject of historical controversy. On the one hand, the Texas Rangers were portrayed as heroic figures protecting settlers from Indian raids and Mexican banditry. On the other hand, they have been described as the main tool of [[Anglo]] expansion on lands formerly occupied by Mexicans and Native Americans.<ref>{{harvnb|Weiss Jr|2012|page= 41}}</ref> To move beyond this dichotomy, historian Robert M. Utley exposes the complex nature of the relationship between the [[Mexican Americans]] and the Texas Rangers. While some rangers may have been \"ruthless, brutal and more lawless than the criminals they were prosecuting,\" he argues that there is no systematic evidence of persecution of Mexican-Americans by this police force <ref>Utley, page xii</ref>.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nGregorio Cortez Lira was born in the state of [[Tamaulipas]], [[Mexico]]<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>, near the U.S.-Mexico border, the son of Roman Cortez Garza, a rancher, and Rosalia Lira Cortinas. Cortez and his first wife divorced in 1903, and in 1905 he married Estefana Garza<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>. They had no children and later separated.<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>\n\nIn 1887, his family moved to [[Manor, Texas]] near [[Austin]]. Two years later, Cortez joined his older brother, Romaldo Cortez, in finding seasonal employment on the farms and ranches of South Texas. Sometime in this period, Cortez married Leonor D\u00edaz; they had four children. After eleven years as ''vaqueros'', or cowboys, and farmhands, Cortez and his brother settled on a farm in [[Karnes County]], renting land from a local rancher. It is known that he spoke [[English language|English]] and owned horses.<ref name=\"orozco\" />\n\nAt the time that Cortez and his family had immigrated to South Texas, [[Anglo]]s had also begun to penetrate the region in increasing numbers, particularly with the arrival of the railroad. As political and economic power shifted to the newcomers, most Mexican Americans, like Cortez, lived as hired agricultural workers or as tenant farmers. Class and ethnicity relegated them to the bottom of a discriminatory Anglo-dominated Texas society.<ref name= \"jastrzembski\">{{harvnb|Jastrzembski|2000}}</ref>\n\n== Adventure of Cortez ==\n\n=== Incident ===\nThe visit to Cortez followed their interrogation of Villareal in connection with a reported [[horse theft]]. Villareal had already acknowledged his recent trade of a horse for a [[mare]] belonging to Gregorio Cortez. And it was exactly this distinction made in Spanish, between a male horse (''caballo'') and a female horse or mare (''yegua''), that Choate misunderstood when questioning Gregorio. The latter answered negatively when asked on behalf of the Sheriff whether he had recently traded for a horse. For, in truth, he had traded a mare.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nCourt records show that the killings of Romaldo (also known as Rom\u00e1n) Cortez, Gregorio's brother, and [[Sheriff]] W.T. (Brack) Morris were related to the subject of a horse trade.<ref name=\"sorell154\">{{harvnb|Sorell|1983|page=154}}</ref> Morris arrived accompanied by one of his [[deputies]], Boone Choate, who could speak Spanish and would thus serve as an interpreter.<ref name=\"sorell154\">{{harvnb|Sorell|1983|page=154}}</ref>\n\nInterpreting the response as a lie, the Sheriff made clear his intention to arrest the Cortez brothers. More words were exchanged and a gun battle followed. The sheriff was the first to draw a pistol despite the suspicion on his part that both Cortezes were probably unarmed. Gregorio killed Sheriff Morris in [[self-defense]] after the Sheriff had fired repeatedly on his brother Romaldo who, thinking that Gregorio was unarmed, ran at the Sheriff trying to protect Gregorio.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nThe Sheriff shot Romaldo and he fell away from the door. And then Gregorio Cortez stood at the door with his pistol in his hand. The Major Sheriff fell dead at the feet of Gregorio Cortez, and it was in this way that Gregorio Cortez killed the first sheriff of many that he was to kill.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 40}}</ref>\nThe killing occurred on June 14, 1901.<ref name= TexasAppeals />\n\n=== Escape to the Robledo ranch ===\n\nAfter the run-in with [[Sheriff]] Morris and [[Sheriffs in the United States|Deputy]] Boone, Cortez wanted to take his injured brother to the closest town, [[Kenedy, Texas]], for medical assistance about 10 miles away. Both on [[horseback]], Cortez and his brother, Romaldo, struggled on their journey as Romaldo was severely hurt and kept falling off his horse. However, Gregorio eventually reached [[Kenedy, Texas|Kenedy,]] left Romaldo in town to be taken care of, and began his flight from the authorities.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 66}}</ref> \n\nAs officers thought Cortez would be heading south to the border to escape, he decided to head north instead to confuse his pursuers. <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" /> He traveled 55 miles from [[Kenedy, Texas|Kenedy]] to [[Belmont, Texas|Belmont]] in hopes of hiding at the house of his friend, Mart\u00edn Robledo. After spending a couple of days at the Robledo ranch, authorities discovered Cortez's whereabouts and thus begun the Battle of Belmont.\n\n=== Battle of Belmont ===\nAfter escaping, Cortez went to the ranch of Mart\u00edn and Refugia Robledo near [[Belmont, Texas]]. There were seven persons at the Robledo house. Mart\u00edn and Refugia Robledo, their three sons, Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez (a boy living with the Robledos) and a visitor, Mart\u00edn Sandoval. Gonzales County Sheriff Robert M. Glover, a friend of Sheriff Morris, knew where Cortez was hiding, probably from information obtained under duress. This information would have been either provided by Cortez's mother, wife or sister-in-law as they were the only people who knew where Cortez was going.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= ??}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals report of facts, on June 15, 1904, at the time Sheriff Morris was killed, Sheriff Glover was in [[Cuero]], [[DeWitt County, Texas]]. Glover proceeded with a [[deputy sheriff]] of De Witt County to Kennedy, in [[Karnes County]], and there for the first time learned that Cortez was the man who had killed Sheriff Morris. Glover, knowing the rendezvous of Cortez, boarded a train in about twenty minutes after receiving the information that Cortez had done the killing and proceeded as expeditiously as he could to the town of Ottine, in Gonzales County; there secured horses, and accompanied by two deputy sheriffs of [[Gonzales County]], including Deputy Swift, and other parties, went a few miles in the country to the Schnable ranch; and there learned that Cortez was at the home of Martin Roblero. He and his posse went to Roblero's. The posse divided as they approached the house from the north side; Glover and one or more companions going on the east side of the house around to the south side; and the other parties going on the west side around to the south side of the house. According to the Court, Some of the testimony tends to show that the sheriff's posse shot first; but the preponderance of the evidence shows that Cortez and Bonafacio fired the first shot. Just before the time that the sheriff's posse arrived at the house, Cortez informed Bonafacio that the Sheriff's troop would be on his tail and asked him what he should do, whether to fight or surrender. Bonafacio would have said, \"We will fight\". Immediately upon Glover getting around to a point opposite the gallery on the south side of the house, Cortez and Bonafacio Roblero (the Roblero's eldest son), who were in the gallery, allegedly fired upon Glover and killed him. There was a general fusillade of shots on the part of the posse and Cortez and Bonafacio. On the other hand, in his testimony, Cortez asserts that the officers came up and immediately fired upon him; that he returned this fire. <ref name= TexasAppeals />\n\nThe San-Antonio Express called the Battle of Belmont, as it came to be known, \u201ca tale of bravery unsurpassed on the part of the officers and of desperation on the part of the Mexicans.\u201d. According to this version of the story, Cortez was waiting in ambush, and as Sheriff Glover and Posseman Schnabel approached, he opened fire. Sheriff Glover and Posseman Schnabel were killed <ref>San Antonio Express, June 16, 1901</ref>\n\nThe actual story, according to the scholar [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]], was less heroic. Just hours after Cortez arrived at the ranch, Glover and his posse had surrounded the house and began to attack. Cortez fired at Glover who fell dead before running into the brush behind the house to hide. Robledo, his eldest son, and Sandoval were involved in the shooting, while Robledo's wife, his two younger sons and Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez stayed unarmed inside the house. Shots were exchanged and Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez was wounded, as well as Robledo\u2019s wife. Another member of the posse shot and killed accidentally his companion, Henry Schnabel. In the end, the posse captured five of the Mexicans, including the two wounded. Cortez, however, escaped.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= ??}}</ref>\n\n=== Flight ===\n\nAfter narrowly escaping the [[Mexican standoff|standoff]] on the Robledo [[ranch]], Cortez \"walked directly south to the [[Bank (geography)|banks]] of the [[Guadalupe River (Texas)|Guadalupe River]] [...] to another friend, Ceferino Flores.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 72}}</ref> Flores gave Cortez a horse and saddle to continue his journey. Cortez would frequently ride in circles and create paths in different directions to throw off the authorities. After days of travel, the [[mare]] grew weary and dropped dead. Soon saddling another small horse, Cortez continued south, just outside of [[Floresville, Texas|Floresville,]] close to [[Cotulla]]. Though Cortez succeeded in creating disorientating routes for officers to follow, he traveled close to the Corpus Christi-to-Laredo [[railroad]] and made it evident that he was moving toward [[Laredo\u2013Nuevo Laredo|Laredo]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> As the law was close behind him, Cortez took risks; having his newfound horse jump over sharp wire fences or pretending he was a [[cattle]] [[herder]]. But on June 20, as the mare could not continue, Cortez left the horse and snuck into [[Cotulla]] and received food and new clothes from locals. Cortez did not have a horse and was essentially surrounded by authorities. However, he went unnoticed, authorities believed he had acquired yet another horse, and that their only chance of catching Cortez would be by accident. Over his 10 day journey, Cortez had ridden three horses, traveled over 500 hundred miles, and had seemingly blended in with the townspeople of [[Cotulla]] <ref name= SanAntonio2016> [https://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/commentary/article/Gregorio-Cortez-the-myth-and-the-man-7420445.php L\u00f3pez, Jos\u00e9 A. \"Gregorio Cortez, the myth and the man.\" ''San Antonio Express-News,'' 7 May 2016.] </ref>.\n\nDuring those 10 days, Cortez was pursued by a posse that at times included up to 300 men. He traveled nearly 400 miles on horseback and more than 100 miles on foot. His story was symbolic of the struggles between the [[Anglo-Americans]] and [[Mexican Americans]] in [[South Texas]].<ref>Afterword by Bill Crider. Elmer Kelton. ''Manhunters''. Texas Christian University Press, 1994</ref>\n\n=== Capture ===\n\nGregorio managed to elude hundreds of men in parties of up to three hundred by riding four hundred miles on mares and walking at least 120 miles along the [[Mexico-Texas border]] before ultimately being captured on June 22.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nSuspecting Gregorio\u2019s presence nearby, Glover and eight other Rangers approached the Martin Robledo home at dawn after drinking a bottle of whiskey together. He divided his posse to the east and west sides to surround the house. With the confusion from the alcohol and darkness of night, the shooting began as Glover reached the southeast corner of the home. Glover and Gregorio fired at each other until Glover fell dead from his horse. With two lawmen dead, an extensive manhunt began for Gregorio. The [[Texas Ranger Division]] became involved when the sheriff of [[Atascosa County]] and Ranger Robert M. Glover were shot on the Thulemeyer ranch. \n\nFrom June 15 to June 25, 1901, the story was front-page news of the [[Daily Express]]. Through the newspaper, Cortez, a lone Mexican vaquero, was transformed into a dynamic leader of well-organized thieves. While the [[Euro-American]] public viewed Cortez as a guilty Mexican, Mexican-Americans transformed Cortez into a heroic figure that could outrun the renowned Texas Rangers, and stand up to his oppressors.<ref>Alvear, 28</ref>\n\n== Trials ==\n=== Court proceedings ===\n\n==== Supporters ====\n\nAfter the capture of Cortez, before court proceedings would begin, [[Mexican-Americans]] across the country started a defense fund for Cortez, saying that without the support it would be impossible for him to get a fair trial <ref name= GarberCourts />. The amount of money raised is unknown, however, the fund was largely advertised by a newspaper publisher, Pablo Cruz, and the Sociedad Trabajador Miguel Hidalgo in [[San Antonio]] and saw donations flood in from rich landowners and even local \"rancheros\".<ref name=\"orozco\" /> Though Cortez's support was mainly from those of Mexican descent, some [[Anglo-Americans]] admired his \"intellect, wisdom and ingenuity <ref name= SanAntonio2016 />. Some prominent Anglo-Texans aiding Cortez were then [[Texas Secretary of State]], F.C. Weinert, and [[defense lawyer]], R.B Abernathy, who Cortez remembered as one of his most vital attorneys, defending him for over four years <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />.\n\n==== Gonzales trial ====\nThe first of Cortez's trials began on July 24, 1901, in [[Gonzales, Texas]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> Though many [[Mexicans]] were vocal about and attended the [[trial]] in Gonzales, the [[jury]] consisted of eleven [[Anglo-Americans]] and one [[African-American]]. At Gonzales, \"a gallery full of lawmen filled the courtroom\" <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" /> and wanted to see Cortez sentenced. The [[prosecution]] tried Cortez for the murder of [[Constable]] Schnabel, one of the men killed at the Battle of Belmont (see above) <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" />. The prosecution had originally claimed the murder to have been done by Mrs. Robledo during the fight, but they shifted the blame to Cortez and told Robledo to testify that she had seen Cortez shoot and kill both Schnabel and Glover<ref name= Algren1997>Algren, Nelson. ''The Last Carousel''. New York, Seven Stories Press, 1997. </ref>. Another [[witness]], Manuel Tom, strengthened the claim, saying that Cortez had confessed to him about killing the two men near a [[barn]] where Robledo described. However, when asked what was the Spanish word for barn (granero) the best Tom could do was say ''casa'', the word for house <ref name= CortezAppeals1902> [https://law.jrank.org/pages/2731/Gregorio-Cortez-Appeals-1902-04-Appeals-Challenge-Convictions.html Gregorio Cortez Appeals: 1902-04 Appeals Challenge Convictions.]</ref>. The trial swayed all jurors, besides an A.L Sanders who believed Cortez to be innocent. However, as a family member of Sanders's soon developed a serious illness and the juror needed to return home. Sanders succumbed to the jury's pressure and agreed with the others that Cortez was guilty; ultimately sentencing Cortez to 50 years in prison for [[second-degree murder]] <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />. Though Sanders later told the defense he voted \"guilty\" to be there for his sick family member, the attorneys motioned for a new trial, however, their plea was struck down and Sanders was fined $100 for [[contempt of court]].<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 91}}</ref>\n\nMany local officers were enraged about the [[verdict]] as they wanted to see Cortez face the [[death penalty]]. A few months later, as Cortez was in a Gonzales jail, over 300 men arranged a [[lynching]] of the recently sentenced prisoner <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2)> [https://law.jrank.org/pages/2733/Gregorio-Cortez-Appeals-1902-04.html Gregorio Cortez Appeals: 1902-04 Convictions Upheld In Glover Shooting] </ref>. The hate-filled attempts were unsuccessful, but tensions grew further as soon thereafter, on January 15, 1902, the [[Texas Court of Criminal Appeals]] reversed Cortez's sentence <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" />. The appeal was upheld as the court doubted that Cortez could have murdered both officers within quick succession, as he would have been in two places at the same time, and denied Manuel Tom's crude translation of the word ''barn'' <ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />. The Gonzales Trial was ultimately a win for Cortez and his defense team, as he would not be tried for the murder of Schnabel again. However, the prosecution backed by the rage of local police forces continued working to see Cortez serve life behind bars or be sentenced to death.\n\n==== Further legal battles ====\nThough Cortez's sentence for the killing of Schnabel was reversed in early 1902 <ref name=GarberCourts> Garber, Margorie B.; Matlock, Jann; Walkowitz, Rebecca (1993). Media Spectacles. New York: Routledge. pp. 91\u2013116.</ref>, Cortez had faced a previous trial from Oct 7-11, 1901 in [[Karnes City, Texas]] and was sentenced to death for the murder of Sherrif Morris <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />. At this trial, \"the families of both Morris and Glover were sat in the front row, where the prosecution could point them out to the jury.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 92}}</ref> However, eight months after the Karnes verdict, the [[Court of Criminal Appeals]] reversed the sentence on the grounds of [[prejudice]] <ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />.

In [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]]'s book, ''With His Pistol in His Hand'', he recites eleven versions of ''El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez'' each sung by numerous ''guitarreros'' (guitarists) near the [[Mexican-American border]].<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 175}}</ref> Though each [[corrido]] had their own style, flair, or message wanting to be relayed, they all exaggerated the life of Cortez to transform him into a Mexican [[folk hero]].\n\n=== With His Pistol in His Hand ===\n\nThe life and legend of Gregorio Cortez were studied by the scholar [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]] in a doctoral thesis on corridos that was later published in a revised version by the University of Texas Press in 1958 under the title ''With His Pistol in His Hand''.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016}}</ref> Paredes's work is about the life of Cortez, his legend, the formal aspects and variants of the corrido, and the cultural significance reflected in these products. \n\nThe book is one of the most influential books in  [[Chicano]] cultural studies and has received wide recognition and outstanding success in the academic world.<ref>Lopez Mor\u00edn, Jos\u00e9 R., and Project Muse University Press Archival eBooks.

''Am\u00e9rico Paredes.'']</ref>. The particularity of the work is that it constitutes a hybrid of genres. The first chapter and the third chapters are historical. In the first one, he retraces the social and political background of the former Spanish province of [[Nuevo Santander]] to explain the origin of ethnic tensions. In the third chapter, through extensive corpus sources (judicial reports, newspapers, and testimonies) he reconstructs in detail the whole life of Cortez. The second chapter could be classified as a study of regional folklore because he describes \"an idealized and formalized version of the legend.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 108}}</ref> In the second part of the book \"El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez, a Ballad of Border Conflict,\u201d Paredes provides a study of the narrative form of the corrido.

It was directed by [[Robert M. Young (director)|Robert Young]], and based on Paredes's  ''With His Pistol in His Hand''.<ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.p 64</ref>. The film deals with the creation of the myth as well as the reconstruction of the historical reality of the life and adventure of Gregorio Cortez.<ref>{{harvnb|Elitzik|1984|page= 38}}</ref>\n\nThe film is classified as a Western, but it is different from other films of the genre due to its historical realism. While classic elements of a western are present in the film such as horse racing, a lynch mob, a heroic sheriff and the vast desert space of Texas, the film's authenticity is a profound departure from this genre <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.P64</ref> <ref>Sunness, page 40</ref> The magazine ''Cin\u00e9aste'' described the film as \"the true history of the West\".<ref>Sunness, page 40</ref> and the movie has been considered the most authentic Westerns in the history of American cinema by the United States Historical Society <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.p64</ref>. This sense of authenticity is due in part to the documentary-style used by the director to tell the life of Gregorio Cortez, but also to the choice made by Villasenor to develop the point of view of the people involved in the story, regardless of their ethnicity, thus presenting real historical characters and not the stereotypes of a myth. This process makes it possible to represent the hostility between communities in South Texas and the violation of the land rights of Mexican Americans by Texas Rangers or lynch mobs <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018. p65</ref>. On the other hand, through this process, the scriptwriters were able to highlight the origins of the myth as well as the stages of its construction. The myth is presented as an episode in the history of the conflict between the Anglo-Americans and The Mexican-Americans.<ref>Sunness, page 40</ref>\n\nIn an interview, the film's director, [[Robert M. Young (director)|Robert Young]], suggested that he wanted to represent the different interpretations surrounding life and legend. He declared \"I thought the important thing was, first, to tell a story that wasn't linear- I don't believe in those kinds of stories, things are always more complicated - and then to deal with the differing interpretations.\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref> Young wanted to represent the fantasies created by the two ethnic groups, namely the exaggeration of Cortez's exploits for the Mexicans and the belief that Cortez was at the head of an entire gang for the Anglos. He declared to the Cin\u00e9aste that he \" tried to take the audience into the story so they would make the same mistakes as the Anglos and, later, when they find out what happened, they wouldn't feel superior to the Anglo characters but realize that they'd made the same error\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref>.\n\nIf racism is portrayed throughout the film, the director downplays it. It was a deliberate choice to keep the humanity of the characters and to denounce it more vigorously. According to Young, \"The people who perpetuate the racism are people, too, they're human. If you go too heavy on the racism, it makes it difficult to see them as people.\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Juan Cortina]]\n* [[Joaquin Murietta]]\n* [[Tiburcio Vasquez]]\n* [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]]\n* [[Manifest Destiny]]\n* [[Texas Ranger Division]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}} \n\n== Sources ==\n* {{citation|last= Alonzo |first= A.

He also dressed in a similar fashion as [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold]] such as a black trench coat and combat boots.
