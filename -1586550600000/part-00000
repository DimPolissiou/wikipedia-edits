This created a need for more systematic architectural education, and the absence of such opportunities caused many aspiring Canadian architects to study in the United States, where ten architecture schools had already been established.<ref name=History /> Canada did not yet have any formal architectural education, and the only forms of architectural education in Montreal were periodical lectures by local practising architects at McGill's affiliated religious colleges. This new need for architectural education is an important factor that led to the founding of the School of Architecture at McGill University.<ref name=Beginning>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/school/history/beginning|title=The beginning with Stewart H.

This required the School to briefly use McGill's [[Dawson College]], a [[satellite campus]] in St. Jean, Quebec, to accommodate its students.

This new need for architectural education is an important factor that led to the founding of the School of Architecture at McGill University.<ref name=Beginning>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/school/history/beginning|title=The beginning with Stewart H.

With a maximum capacity of 48 undergraduate students in the first year undergraduate studio (BSc[Arch]) and 35 students in both of the Master's (MArch&nbsp;1 and MArch&nbsp;II) studios,<ref name=CACB /> the School has one of the most selective and competitive sets of program offerings in the country with one of the lowest overall application-to-acceptance ratios.<ref name=Stats /> \n\nGenerally, about 5\u201310 students from outside Quebec who plan to study architecture for their undergraduate degree will spend their first year at McGill in \"U0\", taking the necessary engineering prerequisites required for the 3-year BSc (Architecture) program at the School of Architecture. Students coming from Quebec [[CEGEP]]s enter directly into the BSc Architecture program, or first-year undergraduate (U1), but are required to have received a [[Diploma of college studies|DEC]] in either pure and applied science or health sciences, as these degrees fulfill the engineering prerequisites for the Architecture program.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/programs/professional#application|title=Application procedures|publisher=Peter Guo-hua Fu School of Architecture, McGill University|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=CACB />\n\nOffers of acceptance into the program are based on a unique review process including an evaluation of a portfolio of works and extracurricular involvement, in addition to grades. In the 2010\u20132011 academic year, there were 687 applications with portfolios to the undergraduate BSc Architecture program with only 51 spaces, giving an overall applications to enrolments ratio of 7.42%.<ref name=Admissions>{{cite web| url=https://info.publicintelligence.net/McGillSoA-AUR.pdf| title=McGill School of Architecture: 2011 Cyclical Academic Unit Review, p.13 Section 2.0: Academic Programs, Teaching and Learning | year=2011 |accessdate=16 January 2020}}</ref> As of 2018, the number of spaces has been reduced to 48.<ref name=CACB>{{cite web|url=https://cacb.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/2018-McGill_University-VTR.pdf|title=2018 Visiting Team Report - Master of Architecture Program - McGill University|publisher=The Canadian Architectural Certification Board|page=16|accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> With the exception of the new Bioengineering degree at McGill, for Quebec [[CEGEP]] students, admissions to the School of Architecture represent the highest average [[R score]] of students accepted into the Faculty of Engineering<ref>{{cite web| url=https://info.publicintelligence.net/McGillSoA-AUR.pdf| title=McGill School of Architecture: 2011 Cyclical Academic Unit Review, p.39 Section 2.7.1 Admissions | year=2011 |accessdate=16 January 2020}}</ref> however in contrast to the high average R score, the lowest score admitted can sometimes be closer to the engineering average due to the importance of the portfolio in the admissions process.\n\nEach year, the Master's program receives over 200 applicants, of which approximately 35 are admitted. Generally, about half of these students obtain their undergraduate degree from McGill, either from the BSc (Arch) program or another at the university.<ref name=CACB />\n\nThe School of Architecture has one of the highest percentages of female representation at McGill, with an overall ratio of female-to-male students of approximately 2:1. As of fall&nbsp;2019, there were 119 female and 44 male undergraduate students, and 54 female and 36 male graduate students enrolled at the School.<ref name=Enrollment />\n\n==Lecture series==\nEach year, the School of Architecture presents public lectures, exhibitions and symposia showcasing leading architects and important figures in the field. These lectures are organized by various individuals and organizations affiliated with the School. Lecture Series include lunchtime \"Brown Bag\" lectures organized by the McGill Architecture Students' Association, evening lectures sponsored by local Montreal firms such as Provencher Roy & [[NEUF Architect(e)s]],<ref name=LectureSeries /> and most notably, the annual [[David Azrieli|David J.
