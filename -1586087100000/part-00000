He studied first mathematics, then [[Greats]] (Greek, Latin, Philosophy and Ancient History), obtaining first class honours, He took the Oxford MA in 1954. He spent the 1957\u201358 academic year at [[Princeton University]], studying mathematics and logic. For 36 years, until his 1996 retirement, he was a Fellow and Tutor of [[Merton College, Oxford]], and he remains an emeritus member of the University Faculty of Philosophy. He was a Fellow of the [[British Academy]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/fellows/john-lucas-FBA|title=Mr John Lucas|website=The British Academy|language=en|access-date=2019-05-11}}</ref>\n\nLucas is perhaps best known for his paper \"[[Minds, Machines and G\u00f6del]],\" arguing that an [[Turing machine|automaton]] cannot represent a human mathematician, essentially refuting [[computationalism]].\n\nAn author with diverse teaching and research interests, Lucas wrote on the [[philosophy of mathematics]], especially the implications of [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem]], the [[philosophy of mind]], [[free will and determinism]], the [[philosophy of science]] including two books on physics coauthored with [[Peter E. Hodgson]], [[causality]], [[political philosophy]], ethics and [[business ethics]], and the [[philosophy of religion]].\n\nThe son of a [[Church of England]] clergyman, and an Anglican himself, Lucas described himself as \"a dyed-in-the-wool traditional Englishman.\" He had four children with Morar Portal, among them [[Edward Lucas (journalist)|Edward Lucas]], a former journalist at ''[[The Economist]]''.\n\nIn addition to his philosophical career, Lucas had a practical interest in [[business ethics]]. He helped found the Oxford Consumers' Group,<ref>[http://www.communigate.co.uk/oxford/oxfordconsumergroup/index.phtml Oxford Consumers' Group] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030830110852/http://www.communigate.co.uk/oxford/oxfordconsumergroup/index.phtml |date=30 August 2003 }}</ref> and was its first chairman in 1961-3, serving again in 1965.\n\n==Philosophical contributions==\n\n===Free will===\n[[Minds, Machines and G\u00f6del|Lucas (1961)]] began a lengthy and heated [[Mechanism (philosophy)#G\u00f6delian arguments|debate]] over the implications of [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems]] for the [[Mechanism (philosophy)#Anthropic mechanism|anthropic mechanism thesis]], by arguing that:<ref>[http://www.leaderu.com/truth/2truth08.html J.R. Lucas, \"The G\u00f6delian Argument\"]</ref>\n# [[Determinism]] \u2194 For any human ''h'' there exists at least one (deterministic) [[logical system]] ''L''(''h'') which reliably predicts ''h'''s actions in all circumstances.\n# For any logical system ''L'' a sufficiently skilled [[mathematical logic]]ian (equipped with a sufficiently powerful computer if necessary) can construct some statements ''T''(''L'') which are true but unprovable in ''L''. (This follows from G\u00f6del's first theorem.) \n# If a human ''m'' is a sufficiently skillful mathematical logician (equipped with a sufficiently powerful computer if necessary) then if ''m'' is given ''L''(''m''), he or she can construct ''T''(''L''(''m'')) and determine that they are true\u2014which ''L''(''m'') cannot do.\n# Hence ''L''(''m'') does not reliably predict ''m'''s actions in all circumstances.\n# Hence ''m'' has [[free will]].\n# It is implausible that the qualitative difference between mathematical logicians and the rest of the population is such that the former have free will and the latter do not.\n\nHis argument was strengthened by the discovery by [[Hava Siegelmann]] in the 1990s that sufficiently complex analogue recurrent neural networks are equivalent to [[Turing Machine]]s.<ref>H.T. Siegelmann, \"Computation Beyond the Turing Limit,\" ''Science'', '''238'''(28), April 1995: 632\u2013637</ref>\n\n===Space, time and causality===\nLucas wrote several books on the philosophy of science and space-time (see below).

It fails to account for the passage of time, the pre-eminence of the present, the directedness of time and the difference between the future and the past\"<ref>''The Future'' (1989), p. 8.</ref> and in favour of a tree structure in which there is only one past or present (at any given point in spacetime) but a large number of possible futures. \"We are by our own decisions in the face of other men's actions and chance circumstances weaving the web of history on the loom of natural necessity\"<ref>''The Future'' (1989), p. 4.</ref>\n\n==Timeline==\n*1942-7.

M. Hare|R.M. Hare]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021223125317/http://web.balliol.ox.ac.uk:80/official/history/hare/memoir.asp|title=Balliol College - History - Past Members - Richard Hare - A Memoir|last=Lucas|first=John|date=2002-12-23|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-05-11}}</ref> at [[Balliol College, Oxford]] he studied first mathematics, then [[Greats]] (Greek, Latin, Philosophy and Ancient History), obtaining first class honours, He then took the Oxford MA in 1954. He spent the 1957\u201358 academic year at [[Princeton University]], studying mathematics and logic. For 36 years, until his 1996 retirement, he was a Fellow and Tutor of [[Merton College, Oxford]], and he remains an emeritus member of the University Faculty of Philosophy. He was a Fellow of the [[British Academy]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/fellows/john-lucas-FBA|title=Mr John Lucas|website=The British Academy|language=en|access-date=2019-05-11}}</ref>\n\nLucas is perhaps best known for his paper \"[[Minds, Machines and G\u00f6del]],\" arguing that an [[Turing machine|automaton]] cannot represent a human mathematician, essentially refuting [[computationalism]].\n\nAn author with diverse teaching and research interests, Lucas wrote on the [[philosophy of mathematics]], especially the implications of [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem]], the [[philosophy of mind]], [[free will and determinism]], the [[philosophy of science]] including two books on physics coauthored with [[Peter E. Hodgson]], [[causality]], [[political philosophy]], ethics and [[business ethics]], and the [[philosophy of religion]].\n\nThe son of a [[Church of England]] clergyman, and an Anglican himself, Lucas described himself as \"a dyed-in-the-wool traditional Englishman.\" He had four children with Morar Portal, among them [[Edward Lucas (journalist)|Edward Lucas]], a former journalist at ''[[The Economist]]''.\n\nIn addition to his philosophical career, Lucas had a practical interest in [[business ethics]]. He helped found the Oxford Consumers' Group,<ref>[http://www.communigate.co.uk/oxford/oxfordconsumergroup/index.phtml Oxford Consumers' Group] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030830110852/http://www.communigate.co.uk/oxford/oxfordconsumergroup/index.phtml |date=30 August 2003 }}</ref> and was its first chairman in 1961-3, serving again in 1965.\n\n==Philosophical contributions==\n\n===Free will===\n[[Minds, Machines and G\u00f6del|Lucas (1961)]] began a lengthy and heated [[Mechanism (philosophy)#G\u00f6delian arguments|debate]] over the implications of [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems]] for the [[Mechanism (philosophy)#Anthropic mechanism|anthropic mechanism thesis]], by arguing that:<ref>[http://www.leaderu.com/truth/2truth08.html J.R. Lucas, \"The G\u00f6delian Argument\"]</ref>\n# [[Determinism]] \u2194 For any human ''h'' there exists at least one (deterministic) [[logical system]] ''L''(''h'') which reliably predicts ''h'''s actions in all circumstances.\n# For any logical system ''L'' a sufficiently skilled [[mathematical logic]]ian (equipped with a sufficiently powerful computer if necessary) can construct some statements ''T''(''L'') which are true but unprovable in ''L''. (This follows from G\u00f6del's first theorem.) \n# If a human ''m'' is a sufficiently skillful mathematical logician (equipped with a sufficiently powerful computer if necessary) then if ''m'' is given ''L''(''m''), he or she can construct ''T''(''L''(''m'')) and determine that they are true\u2014which ''L''(''m'') cannot do.\n# Hence ''L''(''m'') does not reliably predict ''m'''s actions in all circumstances.\n# Hence ''m'' has [[free will]].\n# It is implausible that the qualitative difference between mathematical logicians and the rest of the population is such that the former have free will and the latter do not.\n\nHis argument was strengthened by the discovery by [[Hava Siegelmann]] in the 1990s that sufficiently complex analogue recurrent neural networks are equivalent to [[Turing Machine]]s.<ref>H.T. Siegelmann, \"Computation Beyond the Turing Limit,\" ''Science'', '''238'''(28), April 1995: 632\u2013637</ref>\n\n===Space, time and causality===\nLucas wrote several books on the philosophy of science and space-time (see below). In ''A treatise on time and space''<ref>{{cite book | author = John Randolph Lucas | url = https://archive.org/details/ATreatiseOnTimaAndSpace | title = A treatise on time and space | date = January 1, 1973 | pages  = 332 | publisher = Methien &CO Ltd | archive-url = http://archive.is/wip/msIyY | archive-date = January 26, 2020 | url-status = live}}</ref> he introduced a transcendental derivation of the Lorenz Transformations based on Red and Blue exchanging messages (in Russian and Greek respectively) from their respective frames of reference which demonstrates how these can be derived from a minimal set of philosophical assumptions.\n\nIn ''The Future'' Lucas gives a detailed analysis of tenses and time, arguing that \"the [[eternalism (philosophy of time)|Block universe]] gives a deeply inadequate view of time. It fails to account for the passage of time, the pre-eminence of the present, the directedness of time and the difference between the future and the past\"<ref>''The Future'' (1989), p. 8.</ref> and in favour of a tree structure in which there is only one past or present (at any given point in spacetime) but a large number of possible futures. \"We are by our own decisions in the face of other men's actions and chance circumstances weaving the web of history on the loom of natural necessity\"<ref>''The Future'' (1989), p. 4.</ref>\n\n==Timeline==\n*1942-7.
