Some of them, however, are known to have a [[teleomorph]] (sexual state) in the [[Ascomycota]]. With DNA evidence, all members of the genus ''Aspergillus'' are members of the [[Ascomycota]].\n\nMembers of the genus possess the ability to grow where a high osmotic pressure exists (high concentration of sugar, salt, etc.).  ''Aspergillus'' species are highly [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] and are found in almost all oxygen-rich environments, where they commonly grow as [[Mold (fungus)|mold]]s on the surface of a substrate, as a result of the high oxygen tension. Commonly, fungi grow on carbon-rich substrates like [[monosaccharide]]s (such as [[glucose]]) and [[polysaccharides]] (such as [[amylose]]). ''Aspergillus'' species are common contaminants of starchy foods (such as bread and potatoes), and grow in or on many plants and trees.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nIn addition to growth on carbon sources, many species of ''Aspergillus'' demonstrate [[oligotroph]]y where they are capable of growing in nutrient-depleted environments, or in environments with a complete lack of key nutrients.

Some species can cause infection in humans and other animals. Some infections found in animals have been studied for years, while other species found in animals have been described as new and specific to the investigated disease, and others have been known as names already in use for organisms such as [[Myco-heterotrophy|saprophytes]].

Some of them, however, are known to have a [[teleomorph]] (sexual state) in the [[Ascomycota]]. With DNA evidence, all members of the genus ''Aspergillus'' are members of the [[Ascomycota]].\n\nMembers of the genus possess the ability to grow where a high osmotic pressure exists (high concentration of sugar, salt, etc.).  ''Aspergillus'' species are highly [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] and are found in almost all oxygen-rich environments, where they commonly grow as [[mold]]s on the surface of a substrate, as a result of the high oxygen tension. Commonly, fungi grow on carbon-rich substrates like [[monosaccharide]]s (such as [[glucose]]) and [[polysaccharides]] (such as [[amylose]]). ''Aspergillus'' species are common contaminants of starchy foods (such as bread and potatoes), and grow in or on many plants and trees.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nIn addition to growth on carbon sources, many species of ''Aspergillus'' demonstrate [[oligotroph]]y where they are capable of growing in nutrient-depleted environments, or in environments with a complete lack of key nutrients.

Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death. Names under each date are reported in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\n(1) Please add only those meeting Wikipedia notability guidelines. Include a reference to a reliable source.[a] [b] If a Wikipedia article for the dead does not yet exist, reconsider whether the subject is actually notable.

Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\".

Then, the dancers removed Zoli's costume before undressing themselves, with only skimpy dresses remaining on the girls and a skin-tight shirt on the singer.

Roosevelt showed some willingness to take in some of those on board, but Hull and Southern Democrats voiced vehement opposition, and some of them threatened to withhold their support of Roosevelt in the 1940 election. On 4 June 1939 Roosevelt denied entry to the ship, which was waiting in the Florida strait between Florida and Cuba. The passengers began negotiations with the Cuban government, but those broke down.

However, [[E. C. George Sudarshan]] and [[Robert Marshak]] were the first proponents of the successful V-A (vector minus axial vector, or left-handed) theory for weak interactions in 1957. It was essentially the same theory as that proposed by [[Richard Feynman]] and [[Murray Gell-Mann]] in their \"mathematical physics\" paper on the structure of the [[weak interaction]]. Actually, Gell-Mann had been let in on the Sudarshan/Marshak work on Sudarshan's initiative,<ref name=\"Rothman\"/> but no acknowledgment appeared in the later paper, except for an informal allusion. The reason given was that the originators' work had not been published in a formal or 'reputable enough' science journal at the time.

Many scientists felt that [[Ralph Alpher]], who predicted the cosmic microwave background radiation and in 1948 worked out the underpinnings of the [[Big Bang theory]], should have shared in the prize or received one independently. In 2005, Alpher received the [[National Medal of Science]] for his pioneering contributions to understanding of [[nucleosynthesis]], the prediction of the relic radiation from the Big Bang, as well as for a model for the Big Bang.\n\n;1974\nThe 1974 prize went to [[Martin Ryle]] and [[Antony Hewish]] \"for their pioneering research in radio astrophysics: Ryle for his observations and inventions, in particular of the [[aperture synthesis]] technique, and Hewish for his decisive role in the discovery of [[pulsar]]s\".

David Staelin and Edward Reifenstein, of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia, found a pulsar at the centre of the [[Crab Nebula]]. The notion that pulsars were [[neutron star]]s, leftovers from a [[supernova]] explosion, had been proposed in 1933. Soon after their 1967 discovery, [[Fred Hoyle]] and astronomer [[Thomas Gold]] correctly explained it as a rapidly spinning neutron star with a strong magnetic field, emitting radio waves.

However, Brazilian physicist [[C\u00e9sar Lattes]] was the main researcher and the first author of the historical ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' journal article describing the [[subatomic particle]] [[meson]] pi ([[pion]]). Lattes was solely responsible for the improvement of the nuclear emulsion used by Powell (by asking [[Kodak]] Co. to add more [[boron]] to it\u2014and in 1947, he made with them his great experimental discovery). This result was explained by the Nobel Committee policy (ended in 1960) to award the prize to the research group head only. Lattes calculated the pion's mass and, with USA physicist Eugene Gardner, demonstrated the existence of this particle after atomic collisions in a [[synchrotron]]. Gardner was denied a prize because he died soon thereafter.\n\n;1938\nThe 1938 prize went to [[Enrico Fermi]] in part for \"his demonstrations of the existence of new radioactive elements produced by neutron irradiation\". However, in this case, the award later appeared to be premature: Fermi thought he had created [[transuranic element]]s (specifically, [[hesperium]]), but had in fact unwittingly demonstrated [[nuclear fission]] (and had actually created only [[fission products]]\u2014isotopes of much lighter elements than uranium). The fact that Fermi's interpretation was incorrect was discovered shortly after he had received his prize.\n\n;1936\nThe 1936 prize went to [[Carl D. Anderson]] for the discovery of the positron. While a graduate student at Caltech in 1930, [[Chung-Yao Chao]] was the first to experimentally identify [[positron]]s through [[electron\u2013positron annihilation]], but did not realize what they were. Anderson, Chao's classmate at Caltech, used the same [[radioactive]] source, [[Thallium-208|{{chem|208|Tl}}]], as Chao. (Historically, {{chem|208|Tl}} was known as \"thorium C double prime\" or \"ThC\", see [[decay chain]]s.)

The Nobel committee passed on several nominations for his many other seminal contributions, although these led to prizes for others who later applied more advanced technology to experimentally verify his work, most notably the 2017 prize awarded to the heads of [[LIGO]]. Many predictions of Einstein's theories have been verified as technology advances. Recent examples include the bending of light in a [[gravitational field]], [[gravitational wave]]s (detected by [[LIGO]]), [[gravitational lens]]ing and [[black hole]]s. It wasn't until 1993 that the first evidence for the existence of gravitational radiation came via the Nobel Prize-winning measurements of the [[Hulse\u2013Taylor binary]] system.<ref>\"[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/09/060914094623.htm General Relativity Survives Gruelling Pulsar Test: Einstein At Least 99.95 Percent Right]\", Particle Physics & Astronomy Research Council, 14 September 2006.</ref>\n\nThe committee also failed to recognize the other contributions of his [[Annus Mirabilis papers]] on [[Brownian motion]] and [[special relativity]].

[[Henri Poincar\u00e9]] was also nominated at least once for his work, including on Lorentz's relativity theory. However, [[Walter Kaufmann (physicist)|Kaufmann's]] then-experimental results (incorrectly) cast doubt on Special Relativity. These doubts were not resolved until 1915. By this time, Einstein had progressed to his [[general theory of relativity]], including his theory of gravitation. Empirical support\u2014in this case the predicted spectral shift of sunlight\u2014was in question for many decades. The only piece of original evidence was the consistency with the known [[perihelion]] precession of the planet Mercury. Some additional support was gained at the end of 1919, when the predicted deflection of starlight near the sun was confirmed by [[Arthur Eddington]]'s Solar Eclipse Expedition, though here again the actual results were somewhat ambiguous. Conclusive proof of the gravitational light deflection prediction was not achieved until the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\n[[File:Atalla1963.png|thumb|[[Mohamed M.

However, his outspoken criticism of US [[foreign policy]] and opposition to [[2003 invasion of Iraq|the war in Iraq]] undoubtedly make him one of the more controversial figures to be awarded this prestigious honour. Indeed, the Nobel academy's decision can be read to have an inescapably political element.

'For the last 10 years he has been more angry and vituperative, and that cannot have failed to be noticed.' However, Mr Jenkins insists that, though Pinter's political views may have been a factor, the award is more than justified on artistic criteria alone.

He is far and away the most interesting, the best, the most powerful and most original of English playwrights.'}}</ref> Although poor health prevented him from giving his controversial Nobel Lecture, \"[[Art, Truth and Politics]]\", in person, he appeared on video, which was simultaneously transmitted on Britain's [[Channel Four]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060405023917/http://nobelprize.org/ Harold Pinter \u2013Nobel Lecture].

However, [[E. C. George Sudarshan]] and [[Robert Marshak]] were the first proponents of the successful V-A (vector minus axial vector, or left-handed) theory for weak interactions in 1957. It was essentially the same theory as that proposed by [[Richard Feynman]] and [[Murray Gell-Mann]] in their \"mathematical physics\" paper on the structure of the [[weak interaction]]. Actually, Gell-Mann had been let in on the Sudarshan/Marshak work on Sudarshan's initiative,<ref name=\"Rothman\"/> but no acknowledgment appeared in the later paper, except for an informal allusion. The reason given was that the originators' work had not been published in a formal or 'reputable enough' science journal at the time. The theory is popularly known in the west as the Feynman-Gell-Mann theory.<ref name=\"V-A\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20090207164536/http://www.ph.utexas.edu/fogs/sudarshan_vminusa.html Sudarshan: Seven Science Quests]. ph.utexas.edu.</ref> The V-A theory for weak interactions was, in effect, a new Law of Nature. It was conceived in the face of a series of apparently contradictory experimental results, including several from [[Chien-Shiung Wu]]. It was also aided along by a sprinkling of other evidence, like the [[muon]].

The joint winners, [[Arno Allan Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson]], had their discovery elucidated by others. Many scientists felt that [[Ralph Alpher]], who predicted the cosmic microwave background radiation and in 1948 worked out the underpinnings of the [[Big Bang theory]], should have shared in the prize or received one independently. In 2005, Alpher received the [[National Medal of Science]] for his pioneering contributions to understanding of [[nucleosynthesis]], the prediction of the relic radiation from the Big Bang, as well as for a model for the Big Bang.\n\n;1974\nThe 1974 prize went to [[Martin Ryle]] and [[Antony Hewish]] \"for their pioneering research in radio astrophysics: Ryle for his observations and inventions, in particular of the [[aperture synthesis]] technique, and Hewish for his decisive role in the discovery of [[pulsar]]s\". Hewish was not the first to correctly explain pulsars, initially describing them as communications from \"Little Green Men\" ([[LGM-1]]) in outer space. David Staelin and Edward Reifenstein, of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia, found a pulsar at the centre of the [[Crab Nebula]]. The notion that pulsars were [[neutron star]]s, leftovers from a [[supernova]] explosion, had been proposed in 1933. Soon after their 1967 discovery, [[Fred Hoyle]] and astronomer [[Thomas Gold]] correctly explained it as a rapidly spinning neutron star with a strong magnetic field, emitting radio waves. [[Jocelyn Bell Burnell]], Hewish's graduate student, was not recognized, although she was the first to notice the stellar radio source that was later recognized as a pulsar.<ref name=\"Sharon\">Sharon Bertsch McGrayne (1998) ''Nobel Prize Women in Science: Their Lives, Struggles and Momentous Discoveries'', Carol Pub.

However, Brazilian physicist [[C\u00e9sar Lattes]] was the main researcher and the first author of the historical ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' journal article describing the [[subatomic particle]] [[meson]] pi ([[pion]]). Lattes was solely responsible for the improvement of the nuclear emulsion used by Powell (by asking [[Kodak]] Co. to add more [[boron]] to it\u2014and in 1947, he made with them his great experimental discovery). This result was explained by the Nobel Committee policy (ended in 1960) to award the prize to the research group head only. Lattes calculated the pion's mass and, with USA physicist Eugene Gardner, demonstrated the existence of this particle after atomic collisions in a [[synchrotron]]. Gardner was denied a prize because he died soon thereafter.\n\n;1938\nThe 1938 prize went to [[Enrico Fermi]] in part for \"his demonstrations of the existence of new radioactive elements produced by neutron irradiation\". However, in this case, the award later appeared to be premature: Fermi thought he had created [[transuranic element]]s (specifically, [[hesperium]]), but had in fact unwittingly demonstrated [[nuclear fission]] (and had actually created only [[fission products]]\u2014isotopes of much lighter elements than uranium). The fact that Fermi's interpretation was incorrect was discovered shortly after he had received his prize.\n\n;1936\nThe 1936 prize went to [[Carl D. Anderson]] for the discovery of the positron. While a graduate student at Caltech in 1930, [[Chung-Yao Chao]] was the first to experimentally identify [[positron]]s through [[electron\u2013positron annihilation]], but did not realize what they were. Anderson, Chao's classmate at Caltech, used the same [[radioactive]] source, [[Thallium-208|{{chem|208|Tl}}]], as Chao. (Historically, {{chem|208|Tl}} was known as \"thorium C double prime\" or \"ThC\", see [[decay chain]]s.)

The Nobel committee passed on several nominations for his many other seminal contributions, although these led to prizes for others who later applied more advanced technology to experimentally verify his work, most notably the 2017 prize awarded to the heads of [[LIGO]]. Many predictions of Einstein's theories have been verified as technology advances. Recent examples include the bending of light in a [[gravitational field]], [[gravitational wave]]s (detected by [[LIGO]]), [[gravitational lens]]ing and [[black hole]]s.

However, [[Walter Kaufmann (physicist)|Kaufmann's]] then-experimental results (incorrectly) cast doubt on Special Relativity. These doubts were not resolved until 1915. By this time, Einstein had progressed to his [[general theory of relativity]], including his theory of gravitation. Empirical support\u2014in this case the predicted spectral shift of sunlight\u2014was in question for many decades. The only piece of original evidence was the consistency with the known [[perihelion]] precession of the planet Mercury. Some additional support was gained at the end of 1919, when the predicted deflection of starlight near the sun was confirmed by [[Arthur Eddington]]'s Solar Eclipse Expedition, though here again the actual results were somewhat ambiguous. Conclusive proof of the gravitational light deflection prediction was not achieved until the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\n[[File:Atalla1963.png|thumb|[[Mohamed M.

Banting felt that [[Charles Herbert Best|Charles Best]] was the proper corecipient, while Macleod had merely given them lab space at the [[University of Toronto]] while Macleod was away for the summer. However, on his return, Macleod pointed out some flaws in their experimental design and gave them advice about directions to work in. Banting's original method of isolating insulin required performing surgery on living dogs, which was too labor-intensive to produce insulin on a large scale. Best then set about finding a biochemical extraction method, while [[James Bertram Collip]], a chemistry professor on sabbatical from the [[University of Alberta]], joined Macleod's team and worked in parallel with Best. The two of them succeeded within days of each other. When Banting agreed to receive the prize, he decided to give half of his prize money to Best.
