From 8 July to 4 August, the 93 cyclists cycled 4488&nbsp;km (2,788&nbsp;mi) in fourteen stages around France. The winner, [[Lucien Petit-Breton]], completed the race at an average speed of 28.47&nbsp;km/h (17.69&nbsp;mi/h).<ref name=\"ASO\">{{cite web |url=http://www.letour.fr/HISTO/us/TDF/1906/histoire.html |title=1907 Tour de France |publisher=[[Amaury Sport Organisation]] |accessdate=2 April 2009 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20090504023724/http://www.letour.fr/HISTO/TDF/1907/us/annee.html?RaceYear=1907&x=23&y=4 |archivedate=4 May 2009 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> For the first time, climbs in the Western Alps were included in the Tour de France. The race was dominated at the start by [[\u00c9mile Georget]], who won five of the first eight stages. In the ninth stage, he borrowed a bicycle from a befriended rider after his own broke. This was against the rules; initially he received only a small penalty and his main competitors left the race out of protest. Georget's penalty was then increased and [[Lucien Petit-Breton]] became the new leader. Petit-Breton won two of the remaining stages and the overall victory of the Tour.\n\n==Innovations and changes==\nThe 1907 Tour de France incorporated 14 stages, which was one more than in 1906. For the first time, roads in Switzerland were included.<ref name=\"ASO\"/><ref name=\"mdc1907\"/> The mountain stages in 1906 had been so successful, according to the organiser [[Henri Desgrange]], that the western Alps were included in the race for the first time.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=19\u201322}}\n\nThe 1907 race was also the first time that a car with bicycle repairmen drove behind the riders, to give assistance in solving mechanical problems on bicycles.<ref name=\"mdc1907\"/>\n\nAs in 1906, the race was decided by a points system. At the end of every stage, the winner was given one point, the next cyclist two points, and so on. After the eighth stage, when there were only 49 cyclists left in the race, the points given in the first eight stages were redistributed among the remaining cyclists, according to their positions in those stages.<ref name=\"mdc1907\"/>\n\n==Participants==\n{{main list|List of cyclists in the 1907 Tour de France}}\n\n[[Ren\u00e9 Pottier]], the winner of the [[1906 Tour de France]], did not defend his title because he had committed suicide in early 1907.<ref name=\"mdc1907\"/> Although the riders officially rode the Tour as individuals, some shared the same sponsor and cooperated as if they rode in teams.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=36}} At the start of the race, it was expected that the riders sponsored by [[Alcyon]] and the riders sponsored by [[Peugeot]] would compete for the overall victory. Alcyon started with three main contenders: [[Louis Trousselier]], [[Marcel Cadolle]] and [[L\u00e9on Georget]]; Peugeot counted on [[Emile Georget]].{{sfn|Amels|1984|p=}}\n\nAs in the previous years, there were two classes of cyclists, the ''coureurs de vitesse'' and the ''coureurs sur machines poin\u00e7onn\u00e9es''. Of the 93 cyclists starting the race, 82 were in the ''poin\u00e7onn\u00e9e'' category, which meant that they had to finish the race on the same bicycle as they left, and if it was broken they had to fix it without assistance.{{sfn|Wheatcroft|2007|p=}} The ''coureurs de vitesse'' could get help from the car with bicycle repairmen when they had to fix a bicycle, and when a bicycle was beyond repair, they could change it to a new one.{{sfn|Laget|Montgermont|Cazaban|Laget|2013|p=}}\n\nNot all cyclists were competing for the victory; some only joined as tourists. The most notable of them was [[Henri P\u00e9pin]]. P\u00e9pin had hired two riders, [[Jean Dargassies]] and [[Henri Gauban]], to ride with him. They treated the race as a pleasure ride, stopping for lunch when they chose and spending the night in the best hotels they could find.{{sfn|Chany|Cazeneuve|1985|p=}} Dargassies and Gaubin became the first cyclists in the history of the Tour de France to ride not for their own placings but for another rider's interest. During the race, they found another Tour de France competitor, [[Jean-Marie Teychenne]], lying in a ditch. They helped him get up and fed him; from then on Teychenne also helped P\u00e9pin.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=19\u201322}}{{sfn|Dauncey|Hare|2003|p=73}}\n\n==Race overview==\n\n{{main|1907 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 7|1907 Tour de France, Stage 8 to Stage 14}}\n\nEarly in the race, Trousselier, [[Fran\u00e7ois Faber]] and Emile Georget were the main contenders.<ref name=\"ASO\"/> Trousselier, winner of the [[1905 Tour de France]] and eager to win again, won the first stage.{{sfn|Amels|1984|p=}} In the second stage, the Tour passed the French-German border to finish in Metz, which was then part of Germany. The German authorities allowed the cyclists to finish there, but did not allow the French flag to be flown or the cars of race officials to enter the city.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=68}} At the end of the stage, Emile Georget seemingly beat Trousselier with a very small margin. After inquiry, Desgrange, the Tour's organiser, decided to put both cyclists in first place,{{sfn|Augendre|2016|p=9}} to keep both sponsors satisfied.{{sfn|Amels|1984|p=}}\n\nIn the third stage, the Tour returned to France; at the border, the riders were stopped by two French customs officers and the delay took so long that the stage had to be restarted.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=19\u201322}} During the stage in the Alps, \u00c9mile Georget was better than his competitors; he won the stage and became leader of the general classification.{{sfn|Amels|1984|p=}} Georget won five of the first eight stages, and had a commanding lead.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=19\u201322}} In the seventh stage, [[Marcel Cadolle]], at that time in second place,<ref>{{cite web|title=5\u00e8me Tour de France 1907 \u2013 6\u00e8me \u00e9tape |url=http://memoire-du-cyclisme.net/eta_tdf_1903_1939/tdf1907_6.php |publisher=M\u00e9moire du cyclisme |language=French |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503114635/http://www.memoire-du-cyclisme.net/eta_tdf_1903_1939/tdf1907_6.php |archivedate=3 May 2009 |url-status=dead |accessdate=2 April 2009 }}</ref> fell and his handlebar penetrated his knee, after which he had to give up.{{sfn|Amels|1984|p=}}\n\n[[File:Lucien Mazan.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lucien Petit-Breton]], the winner of the 1907 Tour de France|alt=A man on a bicycle, riding on an outdoor velodrome.]]During the ninth stage, when Georget was leading the race, he broke the frame of his bicycle{{sfn|Amels|1984|p=}} at a checkpoint.

From 8 July to 4 August, the 93 cyclists cycled 4488&nbsp;km (2,788&nbsp;mi) in fourteen stages around France.

The race was dominated at the start by [[\u00c9mile Georget]], who won five of the first eight stages. In the ninth stage, he borrowed a bicycle from a befriended rider after his own broke. This was against the rules; initially he received only a small penalty and his main competitors left the race out of protest. Georget's penalty was then increased and [[Lucien Petit-Breton]] became the new leader. Petit-Breton won two of the remaining stages and the overall victory of the Tour.\n\n==Innovations==\nThe 1907 Tour de France incorporated 14 stages, which was one more than in 1906. For the first time, roads in Switzerland were included.<ref name=\"ASO\"/><ref name=\"mdc1907\"/> The mountain stages in 1906 had been so successful, according to the organiser [[Henri Desgrange]], that the western Alps were included in the race for the first time.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=19\u201322}}\n\nThe 1907 race was also the first time that a car with bicycle repairmen drove behind the riders, to give assistance in solving mechanical problems on bicycles.<ref name=\"mdc1907\"/>\n\nAs in 1906, the race was decided by a points system. At the end of every stage, the winner was given one point, the next cyclist two points, and so on. After the eighth stage, when there were only 49 cyclists left in the race, the points given in the first eight stages were redistributed among the remaining cyclists, according to their positions in those stages.<ref name=\"mdc1907\"/>\n\n==Participants==\n{{main list|List of cyclists in the 1907 Tour de France}}\n\n[[Ren\u00e9 Pottier]], the winner of the [[1906 Tour de France]], did not defend his title because he had committed suicide in early 1907.<ref name=\"mdc1907\"/> Although the riders officially rode the Tour as individuals, some shared the same sponsor and cooperated as if they rode in teams.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=36}} At the start of the race, it was expected that the riders sponsored by [[Alcyon]] and the riders sponsored by [[Peugeot]] would compete for the overall victory. Alcyon started with three main contenders: [[Louis Trousselier]], [[Marcel Cadolle]] and [[L\u00e9on Georget]]; Peugeot counted on [[Emile Georget]].{{sfn|Amels|1984|p=}}\n\nAs in the previous years, there were two classes of cyclists, the ''coureurs de vitesse'' and the ''coureurs sur machines poin\u00e7onn\u00e9es''. Of the 93 cyclists starting the race, 82 were in the ''poin\u00e7onn\u00e9e'' category, which meant that they had to finish the race on the same bicycle as they left, and if it was broken they had to fix it without assistance.{{sfn|Wheatcroft|2007|p=}} The ''coureurs de vitesse'' could get help from the car with bicycle repairmen when they had to fix a bicycle, and when a bicycle was beyond repair, they could change it to a new one.{{sfn|Laget|Montgermont|Cazaban|Laget|2013|p=}}\n\nNot all cyclists were competing for the victory; some only joined as tourists. The most notable of them was [[Henri P\u00e9pin]]. P\u00e9pin had hired two riders, [[Jean Dargassies]] and [[Henri Gauban]], to ride with him. They treated the race as a pleasure ride, stopping for lunch when they chose and spending the night in the best hotels they could find.{{sfn|Chany|Cazeneuve|1985|p=}} Dargassies and Gaubin became the first cyclists in the history of the Tour de France to ride not for their own placings but for another rider's interest. During the race, they found another Tour de France competitor, [[Jean-Marie Teychenne]], lying in a ditch. They helped him get up and fed him; from then on Teychenne also helped P\u00e9pin.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=19\u201322}}{{sfn|Dauncey|Hare|2003|p=73}}\n\n==Race overview==\n\n{{main|1907 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 7|1907 Tour de France, Stage 8 to Stage 14}}\n\nEarly in the race, Trousselier, [[Fran\u00e7ois Faber]] and Emile Georget were the main contenders.<ref name=\"ASO\"/> Trousselier, winner of the [[1905 Tour de France]] and eager to win again, won the first stage.{{sfn|Amels|1984|p=}} In the second stage, the Tour passed the French-German border to finish in Metz, which was then part of Germany. The German authorities allowed the cyclists to finish there, but did not allow the French flag to be flown or the cars of race officials to enter the city.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=68}} At the end of the stage, Emile Georget seemingly beat Trousselier with a very small margin.

She was taking care of her infant sister in the farmhouse. {{sic|Allesandro}} threatened her with a 10-inch awl, and when she refused, as she had always done, he stabbed her 14 times.\n\n: The wounds penetrated her throat, with lesions of the pericardium, heart, lungs, and diaphragm. Surgeons at Orsenigo were surprised that she was still alive. In a dying deposition, in the presence of the Chief of Police, she told her mother of Serenelli's sexual harassment, and two previous attempts made to rape her. She was afraid to reveal this earlier since she was threatened with death.<ref name=\"journalist\" />\n\nA third account of the assault was presented by Italian historian Giordano Bruno Guerri in 1985. He asserted that, while in prison, Alessandro stated that he did not complete the assault and Maria died a virgin. Guerri identifies the weapon as an [[bradawl|awl]] rather than a dagger.<ref name=\"journalist\" />\n\n== Serenelli's imprisonment  ==\nAlessandro Serenelli was captured shortly after the attack: the police taking him to prison overtook the ambulance carrying Maria to the hospital.<ref name=Novarese1967 />{{rp|54}} Originally, he was going to be sentenced to life, but since he was a minor at that time it was commuted to 30 years; judges even considered he was not as mature as he was expected to be for a 20-year-old, and that he grew up in a poor, neglectful family, with several brothers and relatives suffering from madness and an alcoholic father.<ref name=Poage />{{rp|36,60,64}} It has also been suggested that it was due to her mother's plea for mercy that he was not sentenced to death.<ref>Raemers, Rev.

He remained unrepentant and uncommunicative from the world for three years, until a local bishop, [[Monsignor]] Giovanni Blandini, visited him in jail.

In attendance at the ceremony were both Assunta and [[Pope Pius XII]]. On the evening of the ceremony in [[Saint Peter's Basilica]], the Pope walked over to and greeted Assunta. She later reported, \"When I saw the Pope coming, I prayed, 'Madonna, please help me', and I felt faint. He put his hand on my head and said, \"Blessed mother, happy mother, mother of a [[Beatification|Blessed]]!\" Afterward, both could be seen with eyes wet with tears.<ref name=RUEF />{{rp|67}}\n\nThree years later, on June 24, 1950, Pius XII canonized Maria as a saint, the \"[[Saint Agnes]] of the 20th century.\"<ref name=\"LIVES\" /> Assunta was again present at the ceremony, along with her four remaining sons and daughters.

Pius XII spoke, not as before in Latin, but in Italian. \"We order and declare, that the blessed Maria Goretti can be venerated as a Saint and we introduce her into the Canon of Saints\". Some 500,000 people, among them a majority of youth, had come from around the world. Pius asked them: \"Young people, pleasure of the eyes of Jesus, are you determined to resist any attack on your chastity with the help of the grace of God?\" A resounding \"yes\" was the answer.<ref name=RUEF />{{rp|71}}\n\nMaria's three brothers would claim that she intervened miraculously in their lives. Angelo heard her voice telling him to emigrate to America. Alessandro was reportedly miraculously given a sum of money to finance his own emigration to join Angelo. Sandrino died in the United States in 1917, and Angelo died in Italy when he returned there in 1964. Mariano said he heard her voice telling him to stay in his trench when the rest of his unit charged the Germans in [[World War I]]. He, the only survivor of that charge, lived until 1975 and had a large family.<ref name=\"AGE\" />\n\nMaria's remains are kept in the crypt of the Basilica of [[Nostra Signora delle Grazie e Santa Maria Goretti]] in [[Nettuno]], south of [[Rome]].

He is currently the head coach of {{English football updater|Arsenal}} club [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].\n\nBorn in [[San Sebasti\u00e1n]], Arteta played as an [[attacking midfielder|attacking]] and [[defensive midfielder]], and operated primarily as a [[Advanced_playmaker|playmaker]]. He was a [[La Masia|youth player]] at [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], but never featured for the first team, and made his senior debut as a loanee in [[Ligue 1]] with [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] in 2001. He signed for Scottish club [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in 2002, and won the domestic double of the [[2002\u201303 Scottish Premier League|Premier League]] and [[2002\u201303 Scottish League Cup|League Cup]] in his debut season. Following a brief stint with [[Real Sociedad]], Arteta joined [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on loan in 2005; he then signed permanently. He moved to Arsenal in 2011, where he won two [[FA Cup]]s and served as [[Captain (association football)|captain]] from 2014, until his retirement in 2016.\n\nArteta represented [[Spain national football team|Spain]] through several youth levels, but never played for the senior national team.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/archive/2010/04/01/cahill-calls-for-arteta-call-up |publisher=Everton F.C. |title=Cahill Calls for Arteta Call Up |accessdate=24 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009083700/http://www.evertonfc.com/news/archive/2010/04/01/cahill-calls-for-arteta-call-up |archivedate=9 October 2012}}</ref> After retiring from football, Arteta immediately moved to coaching.

During a season and a half in Paris, Arteta was used by manager [[Luis Fernandez]] primarily as a playmaker. He made his first appearances in the [[UEFA Champions League]] in the [[2000\u201301 UEFA Champions League second group stage#Group B|2000\u201301 second group stage]]. PSG wanted to keep Arteta at the end of the loan period, and did have a 'buy first' option.

Initially, Turner planned an elaborate co-headlining tour with [[Elton John]]. The two performed a duet of Turner's hit \"Proud Mary\" and John's \"[[The Bitch is Back]]\" on the VH1 special, \"[[Divas Live '99]]\". During rehearsals, Turner felt unease with the music and stopped everyone from playing and then instructed John on how to play the song.\n\n{{quote|text=\"I made a mistake when I needed to show him how to play 'Proud Mary'. The mistake is you don't show Elton John how to play his piano. He just went into a rage, which he apologized for later. He said it was wrong.\"|sign=Tina Turner|source=CBS News<ref name=\"CBS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/09/11/60minutes/main232429.shtml|title=Tina Turner Bids Farewell|date=2000-09-21|accessdate=2010-09-10|last=Wallace|first=Mike|work=CBS News|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc.}}</ref>}}\n\nThe tour plans were cancelled and Turner scrapped her initial plans for a greatest hits collection deciding to record her final studio album. Along the way, Turner also performed the [[Super Bowl XXXIV]] pre-show ceremonies.\n\nTo introduce the tour, Turner stated:<ref name=\"CBS\"/> <blockquote>It's a play. It's an act. For the moment, it's a small movie, so to speak. That's why I like all of the stuff and the action and the playoff between me and the girls. It's life on that stage for that two hours.</blockquote>\n\n==Development==\nAs mentioned above, the tour initially was set to promote her latest studio album. During promotion, Turner acknowledge the tour as her final one as she enters pseudo-retirement. She comments:<ref name=\"nadates2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.livedaily.com/news/1404.html|title=Tina Turner Mapes Second North American Leg|date=2000-07-06|accessdate=2010-09-10|last=Evans|first=Rob|work=LiveDaily|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211125545/http://livedaily.com/news/1404.html|archivedate=2010-02-11}}</ref> \n<blockquote>I've been performing for 44 years; I really should hang up my dancing shoes. I can't keep up with Janet Jackson. I'm not a diva like Diana Ross. I'm rock 'n' roll, but I'm happy I can do it one more time, so people can remember me at my best.\"</blockquote>\n\nThe album played a prominent role in the tour as Turner rehearsed \"Whatever You Need\", \"When the Heartache is Over\", \"Talk to My Heart\", \"Falling\", \"Don't Leave Me This Way\" (which was to be included in a ballads medley with \"[[Two People (song)|Two People]]\" and two other unknown songs) and \"Twenty Four Seven\". When Turner decided to do a retrospective of her career, she included her first hit, \"[[A Fool in Love]]\", the first time Turner performed the song live since the 1970s. Turner also rehearsed \"Ooh Poo Pah Do\" but replaced with \"Get Back\". Additionally, she included some of her have favorite R&B hits including, \"Hold On, I'm A Comin'\" and \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\".\n\n{{quote|text=\"It has been described as a stadium tour in an arena. [it's] hugely complicated and one of the largest arena shows to ever go out and tour back-to-back.\"|sign=Mark Fisher}}\n\nFor her final outing, Turner wanted a stage that was sleek and modern. Her original concepts included the framing of an \"apartment building\" that had cabins and access ramps. Also included were risers with visible staircases and front drop for the musicians. Fisher, also wanted to create a volcano effect with the staging, have it split into two sets. This inner stage included a video screen and a ramp leading to an upstage platform. There was an additional ramp that lead downstage. The main feature of the stage was the \"cantilever arm\". A 2' wide, 60' long platform that extended Turner into the audience. Initially, Turner did not want the arm as the same concept was used for her [[Foreign Affair: The Farewell Tour|1990 European tour]] and she did not want to repeat herself. However, after seeing video animations, Turner wanted the arm included. For stadium shows, a roof for the stage was added along with additional video screens. The arm was extended an additional 20 feet. It took at least seven hours to construct the stage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://livedesignonline.com/mag/show_business_preaching_converted_tina/|title=Preaching to the Converted: Tina Turner Roars Back on Tour|date=2000-07-01|accessdate=2010-09-10|last=Lampert-Greaux|first=Elllen|work=Live Design|publisher=Penton Media, Inc.}}</ref>\n\nThe stage was constructed by McLaren Engineering Group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mgmclaren.com/node/295|title=Tina Turner 24-7 World Tour Stage|date=|accessdate=2010-09-10|last=|first=|work=McLaren Engineering Group|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Opening act==\n*[[Lionel Richie]] <small>(North America [Leg 1] & UK)</small><ref name=\"nadates1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nyrock.com/worldbeat/03_2000/032300.asp|title=Lionel Richie Joins Tina Turner Tour|date=2000-03-23|accessdate=2010-09-10|work=NY Rocks|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218212530/http://nyrock.com/worldbeat/03_2000/032300.asp|archivedate=2010-12-18}}</ref>\n*[[John Fogerty]] <small>(Europe [select dates])</small>. \n*[[Janice Robinson]] <small>(North America [Leg 1])</small><ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20000512&slug=4020414|title=At 60, Tina Turner is still going strong on her last arena tour|date=2000-05-12|accessdate=2010-09-10|last=MacDonald|first=Patrick|work=The Seattle Times|publisher=The Seattle Times Company}}</ref>\n*[[Joe Cocker]] <small>(Europe [select dates] & North America [Leg 2])</small>\n\n==Set list==\n{{hidden\n| headercss = background: #ccccff; font-size: 100%; width: 65%;\n| contentcss = text-align: left; font-size: 100%; width: 75%;\n| header = North America (Leg I)\n| content =\n#\"Work Like you Don't Need the Money\" <small>(Instrumental Introduction)</small>\n#\"[[I Want to Take You Higher]]\"\n#\"Absolutely Nothing's Changed\"\n#\"[[A Fool in Love]]\"\n#\"[[Acid Queen]]\"\n#\"[[River Deep \u2013 Mountain High]]\"\n#\"[[We Don't Need Another Hero|We Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)]]\"\n#\"[[Get Back]]\"\n#\"[[I Heard It Through the Grapevine]]\"\n#\"[[Private Dancer (Tina Turner song)|Private Dancer]]\"\n#\"[[Let's Stay Together (Al Green song)|Let's Stay Together]]\"\n#\"[[What's Love Got to Do with It (song)|What's Love Got to Do with It]]\"\n#\"[[When the Heartache Is Over]]\"\n#\"[[Baby I'm a Star]]\" <small>(performed by backing vocalist)</small>\n#\"[[Help!

Initially, Turner planned an elaborate co-headlining tour with [[Elton John]]. The two performed a duet of Turner's hit \"Proud Mary\" and John's \"[[The Bitch is Back]]\" on the VH1 special, \"[[Divas Live '99]]\". During rehearsals, Turner felt unease with the music and stopped everyone from playing and then instructed John on how to play the song.\n\n{{quote|text=\"I made a mistake when I needed to show him how to play 'Proud Mary'.

Along the way, Turner also performed the [[Super Bowl XXXIV]] pre-show ceremonies.\n\nTo introduce the tour, Turner stated:<ref name=\"CBS\"/> <blockquote>It's a play. It's an act. For the moment, it's a small movie, so to speak. That's why I like all of the stuff and the action and the playoff between me and the girls. It's life on that stage for that two hours.</blockquote>\n\n==Development==\nAs mentioned above, the tour initially was set to promote her latest studio album. During promotion, Turner acknowledge the tour as her final one as she enters pseudo-retirement. She comments:<ref name=\"nadates2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.livedaily.com/news/1404.html|title=Tina Turner Mapes Second North American Leg|date=2000-07-06|accessdate=2010-09-10|last=Evans|first=Rob|work=LiveDaily|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211125545/http://livedaily.com/news/1404.html|archivedate=2010-02-11}}</ref> \n<blockquote>I've been performing for 44 years; I really should hang up my dancing shoes. I can't keep up with Janet Jackson. I'm not a diva like Diana Ross. I'm rock 'n' roll, but I'm happy I can do it one more time, so people can remember me at my best.\"</blockquote>\n\nThe album played a prominent role in the tour as Turner rehearsed \"Whatever You Need\", \"When the Heartache is Over\", \"Talk to My Heart\", \"Falling\", \"Don't Leave Me This Way\" (which was to be included in a ballads medley with \"[[Two People (song)|Two People]]\" and two other unknown songs) and \"Twenty Four Seven\". When Turner decided to do a retrospective of her career, she included her first hit, \"[[A Fool in Love]]\", the first time Turner performed the song live since the 1970s. Turner also rehearsed \"Ooh Poo Pah Do\" but replaced with \"Get Back\". Additionally, she included some of her have favorite R&B hits including, \"Hold On, I'm A Comin'\" and \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\".\n\n{{quote|text=\"It has been described as a stadium tour in an arena. [it's] hugely complicated and one of the largest arena shows to ever go out and tour back-to-back.\"|sign=Mark Fisher}}\n\nFor her final outing, Turner wanted a stage that was sleek and modern. Her original concepts included the framing of an \"apartment building\" that had cabins and access ramps. Also included were risers with visible staircases and front drop for the musicians. Fisher, also wanted to create a volcano effect with the staging, have it split into two sets. This inner stage included a video screen and a ramp leading to an upstage platform. There was an additional ramp that lead downstage. The main feature of the stage was the \"cantilever arm\". A 2' wide, 60' long platform that extended Turner into the audience. Initially, Turner did not want the arm as the same concept was used for her [[Foreign Affair: The Farewell Tour|1990 European tour]] and she did not want to repeat herself. However, after seeing video animations, Turner wanted the arm included. For stadium shows, a roof for the stage was added along with additional video screens. The arm was extended an additional 20 feet. It took at least seven hours to construct the stage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://livedesignonline.com/mag/show_business_preaching_converted_tina/|title=Preaching to the Converted: Tina Turner Roars Back on Tour|date=2000-07-01|accessdate=2010-09-10|last=Lampert-Greaux|first=Elllen|work=Live Design|publisher=Penton Media, Inc.}}</ref>\n\nThe stage was constructed by McLaren Engineering Group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mgmclaren.com/node/295|title=Tina Turner 24-7 World Tour Stage|date=|accessdate=2010-09-10|last=|first=|work=McLaren Engineering Group|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Opening act==\n*[[Lionel Richie]] <small>(North America [Leg 1] & UK)</small><ref name=\"nadates1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nyrock.com/worldbeat/03_2000/032300.asp|title=Lionel Richie Joins Tina Turner Tour|date=2000-03-23|accessdate=2010-09-10|work=NY Rocks|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218212530/http://nyrock.com/worldbeat/03_2000/032300.asp|archivedate=2010-12-18}}</ref>\n*[[John Fogerty]] <small>(Europe [select dates])</small>. \n*[[Janice Robinson]] <small>(North America [Leg 1])</small><ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20000512&slug=4020414|title=At 60, Tina Turner is still going strong on her last arena tour|date=2000-05-12|accessdate=2010-09-10|last=MacDonald|first=Patrick|work=The Seattle Times|publisher=The Seattle Times Company}}</ref>\n*[[Joe Cocker]] <small>(Europe [select dates] & North America [Leg 2])</small>\n\n==Set list==\n{{hidden\n| headercss = background: #ccccff; font-size: 100%; width: 65%;\n| contentcss = text-align: left; font-size: 100%; width: 75%;\n| header = North America (Leg I)\n| content =\n#\"Work Like you Don't Need the Money\" <small>(Instrumental Introduction)</small>\n#\"[[I Want to Take You Higher]]\"\n#\"Absolutely Nothing's Changed\"\n#\"[[A Fool in Love]]\"\n#\"[[Acid Queen]]\"\n#\"[[River Deep \u2013 Mountain High]]\"\n#\"[[We Don't Need Another Hero|We Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)]]\"\n#\"[[Get Back]]\"\n#\"[[I Heard It Through the Grapevine]]\"\n#\"[[Private Dancer (Tina Turner song)|Private Dancer]]\"\n#\"[[Let's Stay Together (Al Green song)|Let's Stay Together]]\"\n#\"[[What's Love Got to Do with It (song)|What's Love Got to Do with It]]\"\n#\"[[When the Heartache Is Over]]\"\n#\"[[Baby I'm a Star]]\" <small>(performed by backing vocalist)</small>\n#\"[[Help!
