Sufi orders were accused of fostering popular superstitions, resisting modern intellectual attitudes, and standing in the way of progressive reforms. Ideological attacks on Sufism were reinforced by agrarian and educational reforms, as well as new forms of taxation, which were instituted by Westernizing national governments, undermining the economic foundations of Sufi orders. The extent to which Sufi orders declined in the first half of the 20th century varied from country to country, but by the middle of the century the very survival of the orders and traditional Sufi lifestyle appeared doubtful to many observers.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia| first=Alexander |last=Knysh| entry=Sufism|title=The New Cambridge History of Islam|volume=Volume 4: Islamic Cultures and Societies to the End of the Eighteenth Century |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010 |editor=Robert Irwin|pages=60\u201361}}</ref><ref name=OEIW-voll/>\n\nHowever, defying these predictions, Sufism and Sufi orders have continued to play a major role in the Muslim world, also expanding into Muslim-minority countries.

This was adopted by the Islamic world's political and temporal leaderships at the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] summit at Mecca in December 2005, and by six other international Islamic scholarly assemblies including the International Islamic Fiqh Academy of Jeddah, in July 2006. The definition of Sufism can vary drastically between different traditions (what may be intended is simple [[tazkiah]] as opposed to the various manifestations of Sufism around the Islamic world).<ref>[http://ammanmessage.com/ The Amman Message Summary]. Retrieved on Feb 2, 2010.</ref>\n\n===Traditional Islamic thought and Sufism===\n[[File:Tomb of said-ul-Auliya sayyid Ali hamadani.jpg|thumb|left|Tomb of Sayyid Ali Hamadani, [[Kulob]], [[Tajikistan]] ]]\nThe literature of Sufism emphasizes highly subjective matters that resist outside observation, such as the subtle states of the heart. Often these resist direct reference or description, with the consequence that the authors of various Sufi treatises took recourse to allegorical language. For instance, much Sufi poetry refers to intoxication, which Islam expressly forbids. This usage of indirect language and the existence of interpretations by people who had no training in Islam or Sufism led to doubts being cast over the validity of Sufism as a part of Islam. Also, some groups emerged that considered themselves above the ''sharia'' and discussed Sufism as a method of bypassing the rules of Islam in order to attain salvation directly. This was disapproved of by traditional scholars.\n\nFor these and other reasons, the relationship between traditional Islamic scholars and Sufism is complex and a range of scholarly opinion on Sufism in Islam has been the norm. Some scholars, such as Al-Ghazali, helped its propagation while other scholars opposed it. [[William Chittick]] explains the position of Sufism and Sufis this way:\n{{quote|In short, Muslim scholars who focused their energies on understanding the normative guidelines for the body came to be known as jurists, and those who held that the most important task was to train the mind in achieving correct understanding came to be divided into three main schools of thought: theology, philosophy, and Sufism. This leaves us with the third domain of human existence, the spirit. Most Muslims who devoted their major efforts to developing the spiritual dimensions of the human person came to be known as Sufis.{{sfn|Chittick|2007}}}}\n\n===''Neo-Sufism'' {{anchor|Neo-Sufism}}===\n[[File:5861-Linxia-Yu-Baba-Gongbei-main-building-roof.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The mausoleum (''[[gongbei (Islamic architecture)|gongbei]]'') of [[Ma Laichi]] in [[Linxia City]], China]]\n\nThe term \"neo-Sufism\" was originally coined by [[Fazlur Rahman]] and used by other scholars to describe reformist currents among 18th century Sufi orders, whose goal was to remove some of the more ecstatic and pantheistic elements of the Sufi tradition and reassert the importance of Islamic law as the basis for inner spirituality and social activism.<ref name=voll-OEIW>{{cite encyclopedia|author=John O.

[[Sufism Reoriented]] is an offshoot of it charted by the [[syncretism|syncretistic]] teacher [[Meher Baba]]. The [[Golden Sufi Center]] exists in England, Switzerland and the United States. It was founded by [[Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee]] to continue the work of his teacher [[Irina Tweedie]], herself a practitioner of both [[Hinduism]] and neo-Sufism. Other Western Sufi organisations include the Sufi Foundation of America and the [[International Association of Sufism]].\n\n==Theoretical perspectives==\n[[File:Munqidh min al-dalal (last page).jpg|thumb|right|upright|The works of Al-Ghazali firmly defended the concepts of Sufism within the Islamic faith.]]\n\nTraditional Islamic scholars have recognized two major branches within the practice of Sufism, and use this as one key to differentiating among the approaches of different masters and devotional lineages.<ref name=\"Heart 2008\">Muhammad Emin Er, ''Laws of the Heart: A Practical Introduction to the Sufi Order'', Shif\u00e2 Publishers, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-9815196-1-6}}</ref>\n\nOn the one hand there is the order from the signs to the Signifier (or from the arts to the Artisan). In this branch, the seeker begins by purifying the lower self of every corrupting influence that stands in the way of recognizing all of creation as the work of God, as God's active Self-disclosure or theophany.<ref>For a systematic description of the diseases of the heart that are to be overcome in order for this perspective to take root, see Hamza Yusuf, ''Purification of the Heart: Signs, Symptoms and Cures of the Spiritual Diseases of the Heart'', {{ISBN|978-1-929694-15-0}}.</ref> This is the way of Imam Al-Ghazali and of the majority of the Sufi orders.\n\nOn the other hand, there is the order from the Signifier to His signs, from the Artisan to His works. In this branch the seeker experiences divine attraction (''[[jadhba]]''), and is able to enter the order with a glimpse of its endpoint, of direct apprehension of the Divine Presence towards which all spiritual striving is directed. This does not replace the striving to purify the heart, as in the other branch; it simply stems from a different point of entry into the path. This is the way primarily of the masters of the Naqshbandi and [[Shadhili]] orders.<ref>Concerning this, and for an excellent discussion of the concept of attraction (''jadhba''), see especially the Introduction to Abdullah Nur ad-Din Durkee, ''The School of the Shadhdhuliyyah, Volume One: Orisons'', {{ISBN|977-00-1830-9}}.</ref>\n\nContemporary scholars may also recognize a third branch, attributed to the late [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] scholar [[Said Nursi]] and explicated in his vast Qur'an commentary called the [[Risale-i Nur]]. This approach entails strict adherence to the way of Muhammad, in the understanding that this wont, or ''[[sunnah]]'', proposes a complete devotional spirituality adequate to those without access to a master of the Sufi way.<ref>Muhammad Emin Er, ''al-Wasilat al-Fasila'', unpublished MS.</ref>\n\n===Contributions to other domains of scholarship===\nSufism has contributed significantly to the elaboration of theoretical perspectives in many domains of intellectual endeavor. For instance, the doctrine of \"subtle centers\" or centers of subtle cognition (known as ''[[Lataif-e-sitta]]'') addresses the matter of the awakening of spiritual intuition.<ref>[http://nurmuhammad.com/HeartLevels/coverLataif5levelsofheart.htm Realities of The Heart] Lataif</ref> In general, these subtle centers or ''lat\u00e2'if'' are thought of as faculties that are to be purified sequentially in order to bring the seeker's wayfaring to completion. A concise and useful summary of this system from a living exponent of this tradition has been published by [[Muhammad Emin Er]].<ref name=\"Heart 2008\"/>\n\n[[Sufi psychology]] has influenced many areas of thinking both within and outside of Islam, drawing primarily upon three concepts. [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]] (both an [[Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|imam]] in the [[Shia]] tradition and a respected scholar and link in chains of Sufi transmission in all Islamic sects) held that human beings are dominated by a lower self called the [[nafs]] (self, ego, person), a faculty of spiritual intuition called the [[qalb]] (heart), and [[ruh]] (soul). These interact in various ways, producing the spiritual types of the tyrant (dominated by ''nafs''), the person of faith and moderation (dominated by the spiritual heart), and the person lost in love for God (dominated by the ''ruh'').{{sfn|Schimmel|2013}}\n\nOf note with regard to the spread of Sufi psychology in the West is [[Robert Frager]], a Sufi teacher authorized in the [[Khalwati]] [[Jerrahi]] order. Frager was a trained psychologist, born in the United States, who converted to Islam in the course of his practice of Sufism and wrote extensively on Sufism and psychology.<ref>See especially Robert Frager, ''Heart, Self & Soul: The Sufi Psychology of Growth, Balance, and Harmony'', {{ISBN|978-0-8356-0778-0}}.</ref>\n\n[[Sufi cosmology]] and [[Sufi metaphysics]] are also noteworthy areas of intellectual accomplishment.<ref>https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/philosophers-sufis-and-caliphs/philosophical-sufis-among-scholars-ulama-and-their-impact-on-political-culture/D3514A6470BA39F7301678CCAA0DD529</ref>\n\n==Devotional practices of Sufis==\n[[File:Dhikr Rifa-iyya.jpg|thumb|Sufi gathering engaged in ''dhikr'']]\nThe devotional practices of Sufis vary widely. This is because an acknowledged and authorized master of the Sufi path is in effect a physician of the heart, able to diagnose the seeker's impediments to knowledge and pure intention in serving God, and to prescribe to the seeker a course of treatment appropriate to his or her maladies. The consensus among Sufi scholars is that the seeker cannot self-diagnose, and that it can be extremely harmful to undertake any of these practices alone and without formal authorization.<ref>Hakim Moinuddin Chisti, ''The Book of Sufi Healing'', {{ISBN|978-0-89281-043-7}}</ref>\n\nPrerequisites to practice include rigorous adherence to Islamic norms (ritual prayer in its five prescribed times each day, the fast of Ramadan, and so forth). Additionally, the seeker ought to be firmly grounded in supererogatory practices known from the life of Muhammad (such as the \"sunnah prayers\"). This is in accordance with the words, attributed to God, of the following, a famous ''[[Hadith Qudsi]]'':\n<blockquote>\nMy servant draws near to Me through nothing I love more than that which I have made obligatory for him. My servant never ceases drawing near to Me through supererogatory works until I love him. Then, when I love him, I am his hearing through which he hears, his sight through which he sees, his hand through which he grasps, and his foot through which he walks.\n</blockquote>\n\nIt is also necessary for the seeker to have a correct creed (''aqidah''),<ref>For an introduction to the normative creed of Islam as espoused by the consensus of scholars, see Hamza Yusuf, ''The Creed of Imam al-Tahawi'', {{ISBN|978-0-9702843-9-6}}, and Ahmad Ibn Muhammad Maghnisawi, ''Imam Abu Hanifa's Al-Fiqh Al-Akbar Explained'', {{ISBN|978-1-933764-03-0}}.</ref> and to embrace with certainty its tenets.<ref>The meaning of ''certainty'' in this context is emphasized in Muhammad Emin Er, ''The Soul of Islam: Essential Doctrines and Beliefs'', Shif\u00e2 Publishers, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-9815196-0-9}}.</ref> The seeker must also, of necessity, turn away from sins, love of this world, the love of company and renown, obedience to satanic impulse, and the promptings of the lower self. (The way in which this purification of the heart is achieved is outlined in certain books, but must be prescribed in detail by a Sufi master.) The seeker must also be trained to prevent the corruption of those good deeds which have accrued to his or her credit by overcoming the traps of ostentation, pride, arrogance, envy, and long hopes (meaning the hope for a long life allowing us to mend our ways later, rather than immediately, here and now).\n\nSufi practices, while attractive to some, are not a ''means'' for gaining knowledge. The traditional scholars of Sufism hold it as absolutely axiomatic that knowledge of God is not a psychological state generated through breath control. Thus, practice of \"techniques\" is not the cause, but instead the ''occasion'' for such knowledge to be obtained (if at all), given proper prerequisites and proper guidance by a master of the way. Furthermore, the emphasis on practices may obscure a far more important fact: The seeker is, in a sense, to become a broken person, stripped of all habits through the practice of (in the words of Imam Al-Ghazali) solitude, silence, sleeplessness, and hunger.<ref>See in particular the introduction by T. J. Winter to Abu Hamid Muhammad al-Ghazali, ''Al-Ghazali on Disciplining the Soul and on Breaking the Two Desires: Books XXII and XXIII of the Revival of the Religious Sciences'', {{ISBN|978-0-946621-43-9}}.</ref>\n\nMagic may have also been a part of some Sufi practices, notably in India.<ref>Akbar Ahmed, Diiscovering Islam, Making sense of Muslim History and Society, {{ISBN|0-415-28525-9}}(Pbk)</ref>{{page needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n===Dhikr===\n{{main|Dhikr}}\n[[File:Isma allah zat-new.png|thumb|upright|The name of Allah as written on the disciple's heart, according to the Sarwari Qadri Order]]\n''Dhikr'' is the remembrance of Allah commanded in the [[Qur'an]] for all [[Muslims]] through a specific devotional act, such as the repetition of divine names, supplications and aphorisms from ''hadith'' literature and the Quran.

To engage in ''dhikr'' is to practice consciousness of the Divine Presence and [[Love of God#Islam|love]], or \"to seek a state of godwariness\". The Quran refers to Muhammad as the very embodiment of ''dhikr'' of Allah (65:10\u201311). Some types of ''dhikr'' are prescribed for all Muslims and do not require Sufi initiation or the prescription of a Sufi master because they are deemed to be good for every seeker under every circumstance.<ref>Hakim Moinuddin Chisti ''The Book of Sufi Healing'', {{ISBN|978-0-89281-043-7}}</ref>\n\nThe ''dhikr'' may slightly vary among each order.

This practice of ''dhikr'' is called ''[[Dhikr-e-Qulb]]'' (invocation of Allah within the heartbeats).

And thus he is to turn his full consciousness towards God Most High while saying three times: \"''Ilah\u00ee anta maqs\u00fbd\u00ee wa-rid\u00e2ka matl\u00fbb\u00ee''\u2014my God, you are my Goal and Your good pleasure is what I seek\".

It is a customary dance performed within the ''sema'', through which dervishes (also called ''semazens'', from [[Persian language|Persian]] {{lang|fa|\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0639\u0632\u0646}}) aim to reach the source of all perfection, or kemal. This is sought through abandoning one's [[nafs]], [[Ego (spirituality)|egos]] or personal desires, by listening to the music, focusing on [[God]], and spinning one's body in repetitive circles, which has been seen as a symbolic imitation of planets in the [[Solar System]] orbiting the sun.<ref name=\"MOA sema\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hayatidede.org/popups/about_sema.htm|title=The Sema of the Mevlevi|publisher=Mevlevi Order of America|access-date=2009-03-26|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.is/20121221021339/http://www.hayatidede.org/popups/about_sema.htm|archive-date=2012-12-21|df=}}</ref>\n\nAs explained by Sufis:<ref>[http://www.whirlingdervishes.org/whirlingdervishes.htm The Whirling Dervishes of Rumi]</ref>\n<blockquote>In the symbolism of the Sema ritual, the semazen's camel's hair hat (sikke) represents the tombstone of the ego; his wide, white skirt (''tennure'') represents the ego's shroud. By removing his black cloak (''h\u0131rka''), he is spiritually reborn to the truth. At the beginning of the Sema, by holding his arms crosswise, the semazen appears to represent the number one, thus testifying to God's unity. While whirling, his arms are open: his right arm is directed to the sky, ready to receive God's beneficence; his left hand, upon which his eyes are fastened, is turned toward the earth. The semazen conveys God's spiritual gift to those who are witnessing the Sema. Revolving from right to left around the heart, the semazen embraces all humanity with love. The human being has been created with love in order to love. Mevl\u00e2na Jal\u00e2ludd\u00een Rumi says, \"All loves are a bridge to Divine love. Yet, those who have not had a taste of it do not know!\"</blockquote>\n\n=== Music ===\n''[[Qawwali]]'' is a form of Sufi devotional music popular in [[South Asia]], usually performed at ''[[dargah]]s''. Sufi saint [[Amir Khusrau]] is said to have infused Persian, Arabic Turkish and [[Indian classical music|Indian classical]] musical styles to create the genre in the 13th century. The songs are classified into [[hamd]], [[Na`at|na'at]], [[manqabat]], [[marsiya]] or [[ghazal]], among others. The songs lasting for about 15 to 30 minutes, are performed by a group of singers, and instruments including the [[Pump organ|harmonium]], [[tabla]] and [[dholak]] are used.

Qadiriyya was his patronym. Gilani spent his early life in Na'if, the town of his birth. There, he pursued the study of [[Hanbali]] law. [[Abu Saeed Mubarak Makhzoomi]] gave Gilani lessons in [[fiqh]]. He was given lessons about ''hadith'' by Abu Bakr ibn Muzaffar. He was given lessons about Tafsir by Abu Muhammad Ja'far, a commentator. His Sufi spiritual instructor was Abu'l-Khair Hammad ibn Muslim al-Dabbas. After completing his education, Gilani left Baghdad. He spent twenty-five years as a reclusive wanderer in the desert regions of Iraq. In 1127, Gilani returned to Baghdad and began to preach to the public. He joined the teaching staff of the school belonging to his own teacher, [[Abu Saeed Mubarak Makhzoomi]], and was popular with students.

He was first found by a group of religious pilgrims in the early 1900s meditating in the jungles of Kataragama in Sri Lanka (Ceylon). Awed and inspired by his personality and the depth of his wisdom, he was invited to a nearby village. Since that time, people of all walks of life from paupers to prime ministers belonging to all religious and ethnic backgrounds have flocked to see Sheikh Bawa Muhaiyaddeen to seek comfort, guidance and help.

His writings, especially al-Futuhat al-Makkiyya and Fusus al-hikam, have been studied within all the Sufi orders as the clearest expression of ''tawhid'' (Divine Unity), though because of their recondite nature they were often only given to initiates. Later those who followed his teaching became known as the school of ''wahdat al-wujud'' (the Oneness of Being). He himself considered his writings to have been divinely inspired. As he expressed the Way to one of his close disciples, his legacy is that 'you should never ever abandon your servant-hood (''\u02bfubudiyya''), and that there may never be in your soul a longing for any existing thing'.<ref>K. al-Wasa'il, quoted in ''The Unlimited Mercifier'', Stephen Hirtenstein, p. 246</ref>\n\n===Junayd of Baghdad===\n[[Junayd of Baghdad|Junayd al-Baghdadi]] (830\u2013910) was one of the great early Sufis. His order was Junaidia, which links to the golden chain of many Sufi orders. He laid the groundwork for sober mysticism in contrast to that of God-intoxicated Sufis like al-Hallaj, Bayazid Bastami and Abusaeid Abolkheir. During the trial of al-Hallaj, his former disciple, the Caliph of the time demanded his fatwa. In response, he issued this fatwa: \"From the outward appearance he is to die and we judge according to the outward appearance and God knows better\". He is referred to by Sufis as Sayyid-ut Taifa\u2014i.e., the leader of the group. He lived and died in the city of Baghdad.\n\n===Mansur Al-Hallaj===\n[[Mansur Al-Hallaj]] (died 922) is renowned for his claim, ''Ana-l-Haqq'' (\"I am The Truth\"). His refusal to recant this utterance, which was regarded as [[apostasy]], led to a long trial. He was imprisoned for 11 years in a Baghdad prison, before being tortured and publicly dismembered on March 26, 922. He is still revered by Sufis for his willingness to embrace torture and death rather than recant. It is said that during his prayers, he would say \"O Lord! You are the guide of those who are passing through the Valley of Bewilderment.

Moinuddin Chishti introduced and established the order in the Indian subcontinent. The initial spiritual chain or silsila of the Chishti order in India, comprising Moinuddin Chishti, [[Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki|Bakhtiyar Kaki]], [[Fariduddin Ganjshakar|Baba Farid]], [[Nizamuddin Auliya]] (each successive person being the disciple of the previous one), constitutes the great Sufi saints of Indian history. Moinuddin Chisht\u012b turned towards India, reputedly after a dream in which Muhammad blessed him to do so. After a brief stay at Lahore, he reached [[Ajmer]] along with Sultan [[Muhammad of Ghor|Shah\u0101b-ud-Din Muhammad Ghori]], and settled down there. In Ajmer, he attracted a substantial following, acquiring a great deal of respect amongst the residents of the city.

Sufis often visit the shrine for [[ziyarat]], a term associated with religious visits and pilgrimages. Dargahs are often associated with Sufi eating and meeting rooms and hostels, called ''[[khanqah]]'' or hospices. They usually include a mosque, meeting rooms, Islamic religious schools ([[madrassas]]), residences for a teacher or caretaker, hospitals, and other buildings for community purposes.\n\n==Major Sufi orders==\n{{main|Tariqa|List of Sufi orders}}\n[[File:Syariah-thariqah-hakikah2.jpg|thumb|\"Tariqat\" in the Four Spiritual Stations: The Four Stations, ''sharia'', tariqa, [[haqiqa]].

The word \"''Naqshbandi''\" ({{lang|fa|{{big|\u0646\u0642\u0634\u0628\u0646\u062f\u06cc}}}}) is [[Persian language|Persian]], taken from the name of the founder of the order, [[Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari]].

There is evidence that Sufism did influence the development of some schools of Jewish philosophy and ethics. In the first writing of this kind, we see \"Kitab al-Hidayah ila Fara'i\u1e0d al-\u1e32ulub\", ''[[Duties of the Heart]]'', of [[Bahya ibn Paquda]]. This book was translated by [[Judah ibn Tibbon]] into [[Hebrew]] under the title \"\u1e24\u014d\u1e07\u014d\u1e6f Ha-lle\u1e07\u0101\u1e07\u014d\u1e6f\".<ref>''A Sufi-Jewish Dialogue: Philosophy and Mysticism in Bahya ibn Paquda's Duties of the Heart'', Diana Lobel</ref>{{quote|The precepts prescribed by the [[Torah]] number 613 only; those dictated by the intellect are innumerable.}}\n\nIt is noteworthy that in the ethical writings of the Sufis [[Al-Kusajri]] and [[Harawi (genre)|Al-Harawi]] there are sections which treat of the same subjects as those treated in the \"\u1e24ovot ha-Lebabot\" and which bear the same titles: e.g., \"Bab al-Tawakkul\"; \"Bab al-Taubah\"; \"Bab al-Mu\u1e25asabah\"; \"Bab al-Tawa\u1e0du'\"; \"Bab al-Zuhd\". In the ninth gate, Ba\u1e25ya directly quotes sayings of the Sufis, whom he calls ''Perushim''. However, the author of the ''\u1e24\u014d\u1e07\u014d\u1e6f Ha-lle\u1e07\u0101\u1e07\u014d\u1e6f'' did not go so far as to approve of the asceticism of the Sufis, although he showed a marked predilection for their ethical principles.\n\n[[Avraham son of Rambam|Abraham ben Moses ben Maimon]], the son of the Jewish philosopher [[Maimonides]], believed that Sufi practices and doctrines continue the tradition of the Biblical prophets. See Sefer Hammaspiq, \"Happerishuth\", Chapter 11 (\"Ha-mma\u02bfa\u1e07\u0101q\") s.v. hithbonen efo be-masoreth mufla'a zo, citing the Talmudic explanation of Jeremiah 13:27 in Chagigah 5b; in Rabbi Yaakov Wincelberg's translation, \"The Way of Serving God\" (Feldheim), p.&nbsp;429 and above, p.&nbsp;427. Also see ibid., Chapter 10 (\"Iqqu\u1e07im\"), s.v. wa-halo yo\u1e0fe\u02bea\u02bf atta; in \"The Way of Serving God\", p.&nbsp;371.\n\nAbraham Maimuni's principal work is originally composed in [[Judeo-Arabic]] and entitled \"\u05db\u05ea\u05d0\u05d1 \u05db\u05e4\u05d0\u05d9\u05d4 \u05d0\u05dc\u05e2\u05d0\u05d1\u05d3\u05d9\u05df\" ''Kit\u0101b Kif\u0101yah al-'\u0100bid\u012bn'' (\"A Comprehensive Guide for the Servants of God\"). From the extant surviving portion it is conjectured that Maimuni's treatise was three times as long as his father's Guide for the Perplexed. In the book, Maimuni evidences a great appreciation for, and affinity to, Sufism. Followers of his path continued to foster a Jewish-Sufi form of pietism for at least a century, and he is rightly considered the founder of this pietistic school, which was centered in [[Egypt]].\n\nThe followers of this path, which they called, interchangeably, Hasidism (not to be confused with the [later] [[Jewish]] [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] movement) or Sufism (''Tasawwuf''), practiced spiritual retreats, solitude, fasting and sleep deprivation. The Jewish Sufis maintained their own [[Sufi order|brotherhood]], guided by a religious leader\u2014like a Sufi [[sheikh]].<ref name=\"revues\">{{cite web|url=http://bcrfj.revues.org/index2312.html |title=Jewish pietism of the Sufi type |author=Mireille Loubet |publisher=bcrfj.revues.org|accessdate=26 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] in its entry on Sufism states that the revival of Jewish mysticism in Muslim countries is probably due to the spread of Sufism in the same geographical areas.

The extent to which Sufi orders declined in the first half of the 20th century varied from country to country, but by the middle of the century the very survival of the orders and traditional Sufi lifestyle appeared doubtful to many observers.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia| first=Alexander |last=Knysh| entry=Sufism|title=The New Cambridge History of Islam|volume=Volume 4: Islamic Cultures and Societies to the End of the Eighteenth Century |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010 |editor=Robert Irwin|pages=60\u201361}}</ref><ref name=OEIW-voll/>\n\nHowever, defying these predictions, Sufism and Sufi orders have continued to play a major role in the Muslim world, also expanding into Muslim-minority countries.

The definition of Sufism can vary drastically between different traditions (what may be intended is simple [[tazkiah]] as opposed to the various manifestations of Sufism around the Islamic world).<ref>[http://ammanmessage.com/ The Amman Message Summary]. Retrieved on Feb 2, 2010.</ref>\n\n===Traditional Islamic thought and Sufism===\n[[File:Tomb of said-ul-Auliya sayyid Ali hamadani.jpg|thumb|left|Tomb of Sayyid Ali Hamadani, [[Kulob]], [[Tajikistan]] ]]\nThe literature of Sufism emphasizes highly subjective matters that resist outside observation, such as the subtle states of the heart. Often these resist direct reference or description, with the consequence that the authors of various Sufi treatises took recourse to allegorical language. For instance, much Sufi poetry refers to intoxication, which Islam expressly forbids. This usage of indirect language and the existence of interpretations by people who had no training in Islam or Sufism led to doubts being cast over the validity of Sufism as a part of Islam. Also, some groups emerged that considered themselves above the ''sharia'' and discussed Sufism as a method of bypassing the rules of Islam in order to attain salvation directly. This was disapproved of by traditional scholars.\n\nFor these and other reasons, the relationship between traditional Islamic scholars and Sufism is complex and a range of scholarly opinion on Sufism in Islam has been the norm. Some scholars, such as Al-Ghazali, helped its propagation while other scholars opposed it. [[William Chittick]] explains the position of Sufism and Sufis this way:\n{{quote|In short, Muslim scholars who focused their energies on understanding the normative guidelines for the body came to be known as jurists, and those who held that the most important task was to train the mind in achieving correct understanding came to be divided into three main schools of thought: theology, philosophy, and Sufism. This leaves us with the third domain of human existence, the spirit.

[[Sufism Reoriented]] is an offshoot of it charted by the [[syncretism|syncretistic]] teacher [[Meher Baba]]. The [[Golden Sufi Center]] exists in England, Switzerland and the United States. It was founded by [[Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee]] to continue the work of his teacher [[Irina Tweedie]], herself a practitioner of both [[Hinduism]] and neo-Sufism. Other Western Sufi organisations include the Sufi Foundation of America and the [[International Association of Sufism]].\n\n==Theoretical perspectives==\n[[File:Munqidh min al-dalal (last page).jpg|thumb|right|upright|The works of Al-Ghazali firmly defended the concepts of Sufism within the Islamic faith.]]\n\nTraditional Islamic scholars have recognized two major branches within the practice of Sufism, and use this as one key to differentiating among the approaches of different masters and devotional lineages.<ref name=\"Heart 2008\">Muhammad Emin Er, ''Laws of the Heart: A Practical Introduction to the Sufi Order'', Shif\u00e2 Publishers, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-9815196-1-6}}</ref>\n\nOn the one hand there is the order from the signs to the Signifier (or from the arts to the Artisan). In this branch, the seeker begins by purifying the lower self of every corrupting influence that stands in the way of recognizing all of creation as the work of God, as God's active Self-disclosure or theophany.<ref>For a systematic description of the diseases of the heart that are to be overcome in order for this perspective to take root, see Hamza Yusuf, ''Purification of the Heart: Signs, Symptoms and Cures of the Spiritual Diseases of the Heart'', {{ISBN|978-1-929694-15-0}}.</ref> This is the way of Imam Al-Ghazali and of the majority of the Sufi orders.\n\nOn the other hand, there is the order from the Signifier to His signs, from the Artisan to His works. In this branch the seeker experiences divine attraction (''[[jadhba]]''), and is able to enter the order with a glimpse of its endpoint, of direct apprehension of the Divine Presence towards which all spiritual striving is directed. This does not replace the striving to purify the heart, as in the other branch; it simply stems from a different point of entry into the path. This is the way primarily of the masters of the Naqshbandi and [[Shadhili]] orders.<ref>Concerning this, and for an excellent discussion of the concept of attraction (''jadhba''), see especially the Introduction to Abdullah Nur ad-Din Durkee, ''The School of the Shadhdhuliyyah, Volume One: Orisons'', {{ISBN|977-00-1830-9}}.</ref>\n\nContemporary scholars may also recognize a third branch, attributed to the late [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] scholar [[Said Nursi]] and explicated in his vast Qur'an commentary called the [[Risale-i Nur]]. This approach entails strict adherence to the way of Muhammad, in the understanding that this wont, or ''[[sunnah]]'', proposes a complete devotional spirituality adequate to those without access to a master of the Sufi way.<ref>Muhammad Emin Er, ''al-Wasilat al-Fasila'', unpublished MS.</ref>\n\n===Contributions to other domains of scholarship===\nSufism has contributed significantly to the elaboration of theoretical perspectives in many domains of intellectual endeavor. For instance, the doctrine of \"subtle centers\" or centers of subtle cognition (known as ''[[Lataif-e-sitta]]'') addresses the matter of the awakening of spiritual intuition.<ref>[http://nurmuhammad.com/HeartLevels/coverLataif5levelsofheart.htm Realities of The Heart] Lataif</ref> In general, these subtle centers or ''lat\u00e2'if'' are thought of as faculties that are to be purified sequentially in order to bring the seeker's wayfaring to completion. A concise and useful summary of this system from a living exponent of this tradition has been published by [[Muhammad Emin Er]].<ref name=\"Heart 2008\"/>\n\n[[Sufi psychology]] has influenced many areas of thinking both within and outside of Islam, drawing primarily upon three concepts. [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]] (both an [[Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|imam]] in the [[Shia]] tradition and a respected scholar and link in chains of Sufi transmission in all Islamic sects) held that human beings are dominated by a lower self called the [[nafs]] (self, ego, person), a faculty of spiritual intuition called the [[qalb]] (heart), and [[ruh]] (soul). These interact in various ways, producing the spiritual types of the tyrant (dominated by ''nafs''), the person of faith and moderation (dominated by the spiritual heart), and the person lost in love for God (dominated by the ''ruh'').{{sfn|Schimmel|2013}}\n\nOf note with regard to the spread of Sufi psychology in the West is [[Robert Frager]], a Sufi teacher authorized in the [[Khalwati]] [[Jerrahi]] order. Frager was a trained psychologist, born in the United States, who converted to Islam in the course of his practice of Sufism and wrote extensively on Sufism and psychology.<ref>See especially Robert Frager, ''Heart, Self & Soul: The Sufi Psychology of Growth, Balance, and Harmony'', {{ISBN|978-0-8356-0778-0}}.</ref>\n\n[[Sufi cosmology]] and [[Sufi metaphysics]] are also noteworthy areas of intellectual accomplishment.<ref>https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/philosophers-sufis-and-caliphs/philosophical-sufis-among-scholars-ulama-and-their-impact-on-political-culture/D3514A6470BA39F7301678CCAA0DD529</ref>\n\n==Devotional practices of Sufis==\n[[File:Dhikr Rifa-iyya.jpg|thumb|Sufi gathering engaged in ''dhikr'']]\nThe devotional practices of Sufis vary widely. This is because an acknowledged and authorized master of the Sufi path is in effect a physician of the heart, able to diagnose the seeker's impediments to knowledge and pure intention in serving God, and to prescribe to the seeker a course of treatment appropriate to his or her maladies. The consensus among Sufi scholars is that the seeker cannot self-diagnose, and that it can be extremely harmful to undertake any of these practices alone and without formal authorization.<ref>Hakim Moinuddin Chisti, ''The Book of Sufi Healing'', {{ISBN|978-0-89281-043-7}}</ref>\n\nPrerequisites to practice include rigorous adherence to Islamic norms (ritual prayer in its five prescribed times each day, the fast of Ramadan, and so forth). Additionally, the seeker ought to be firmly grounded in supererogatory practices known from the life of Muhammad (such as the \"sunnah prayers\"). This is in accordance with the words, attributed to God, of the following, a famous ''[[Hadith Qudsi]]'':\n<blockquote>\nMy servant draws near to Me through nothing I love more than that which I have made obligatory for him. My servant never ceases drawing near to Me through supererogatory works until I love him. Then, when I love him, I am his hearing through which he hears, his sight through which he sees, his hand through which he grasps, and his foot through which he walks.\n</blockquote>\n\nIt is also necessary for the seeker to have a correct creed (''aqidah''),<ref>For an introduction to the normative creed of Islam as espoused by the consensus of scholars, see Hamza Yusuf, ''The Creed of Imam al-Tahawi'', {{ISBN|978-0-9702843-9-6}}, and Ahmad Ibn Muhammad Maghnisawi, ''Imam Abu Hanifa's Al-Fiqh Al-Akbar Explained'', {{ISBN|978-1-933764-03-0}}.</ref> and to embrace with certainty its tenets.<ref>The meaning of ''certainty'' in this context is emphasized in Muhammad Emin Er, ''The Soul of Islam: Essential Doctrines and Beliefs'', Shif\u00e2 Publishers, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-9815196-0-9}}.</ref> The seeker must also, of necessity, turn away from sins, love of this world, the love of company and renown, obedience to satanic impulse, and the promptings of the lower self. (The way in which this purification of the heart is achieved is outlined in certain books, but must be prescribed in detail by a Sufi master.) The seeker must also be trained to prevent the corruption of those good deeds which have accrued to his or her credit by overcoming the traps of ostentation, pride, arrogance, envy, and long hopes (meaning the hope for a long life allowing us to mend our ways later, rather than immediately, here and now).\n\nSufi practices, while attractive to some, are not a ''means'' for gaining knowledge. The traditional scholars of Sufism hold it as absolutely axiomatic that knowledge of God is not a psychological state generated through breath control. Thus, practice of \"techniques\" is not the cause, but instead the ''occasion'' for such knowledge to be obtained (if at all), given proper prerequisites and proper guidance by a master of the way. Furthermore, the emphasis on practices may obscure a far more important fact: The seeker is, in a sense, to become a broken person, stripped of all habits through the practice of (in the words of Imam Al-Ghazali) solitude, silence, sleeplessness, and hunger.<ref>See in particular the introduction by T. J. Winter to Abu Hamid Muhammad al-Ghazali, ''Al-Ghazali on Disciplining the Soul and on Breaking the Two Desires: Books XXII and XXIII of the Revival of the Religious Sciences'', {{ISBN|978-0-946621-43-9}}.</ref>\n\nMagic may have also been a part of some Sufi practices, notably in India.<ref>Akbar Ahmed, Diiscovering Islam, Making sense of Muslim History and Society, {{ISBN|0-415-28525-9}}(Pbk)</ref>{{page needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n===Dhikr===\n{{main|Dhikr}}\n[[File:Isma allah zat-new.png|thumb|upright|The name of Allah as written on the disciple's heart, according to the Sarwari Qadri Order]]\n''Dhikr'' is the remembrance of Allah commanded in the [[Qur'an]] for all [[Muslims]] through a specific devotional act, such as the repetition of divine names, supplications and aphorisms from ''hadith'' literature and the Quran.

To engage in ''dhikr'' is to practice consciousness of the Divine Presence and [[Love of God#Islam|love]], or \"to seek a state of godwariness\". The Quran refers to Muhammad as the very embodiment of ''dhikr'' of Allah (65:10\u201311). Some types of ''dhikr'' are prescribed for all Muslims and do not require Sufi initiation or the prescription of a Sufi master because they are deemed to be good for every seeker under every circumstance.<ref>Hakim Moinuddin Chisti ''The Book of Sufi Healing'', {{ISBN|978-0-89281-043-7}}</ref>\n\nThe ''dhikr'' may slightly vary among each order.

This practice of ''dhikr'' is called ''[[Dhikr-e-Qulb]]'' (invocation of Allah within the heartbeats). The basic idea in this practice is to visualize the Allah as having been written on the disciple's heart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goharshahi.net/images/books_files/menar-e-noor_files/What%20is%20Remembrance%20and%20what%20is%20Contemplation.htm|title=What is Remembrance and what is Contemplation?|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415182616/http://www.goharshahi.net/images/books_files/menar-e-noor_files/What%20is%20Remembrance%20and%20what%20is%20Contemplation.htm|archive-date=2008-04-15}}</ref>\n\n===Muraqaba===\n{{main|Muraqaba}}\nThe practice of ''muraqaba'' can be likened to the practices of [[meditation]] attested in many faith communities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sultan-bahoo.com/en/tafakkur-and-muraqbah-meditation-and-concentration.html#Tafakkur-Muraqbah|title=Muraqaba|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609000104/http://www.sultan-bahoo.com/en/tafakkur-and-muraqbah-meditation-and-concentration.html#Tafakkur-Muraqbah|archive-date=2015-06-09|df=}}</ref>\n\nWhile variation exists, one description of the practice within a Naqshbandi lineage reads as follows:\n<blockquote>\nHe is to collect all of his bodily senses in concentration, and to cut himself off from all preoccupation and notions that inflict themselves upon the heart.

By removing his black cloak (''h\u0131rka''), he is spiritually reborn to the truth. At the beginning of the Sema, by holding his arms crosswise, the semazen appears to represent the number one, thus testifying to God's unity. While whirling, his arms are open: his right arm is directed to the sky, ready to receive God's beneficence; his left hand, upon which his eyes are fastened, is turned toward the earth. The semazen conveys God's spiritual gift to those who are witnessing the Sema. Revolving from right to left around the heart, the semazen embraces all humanity with love. The human being has been created with love in order to love. Mevl\u00e2na Jal\u00e2ludd\u00een Rumi says, \"All loves are a bridge to Divine love.

He was first found by a group of religious pilgrims in the early 1900s meditating in the jungles of Kataragama in Sri Lanka (Ceylon). Awed and inspired by his personality and the depth of his wisdom, he was invited to a nearby village. Since that time, people of all walks of life from paupers to prime ministers belonging to all religious and ethnic backgrounds have flocked to see Sheikh Bawa Muhaiyaddeen to seek comfort, guidance and help. Sheikh Bawa Muhaiyaddeen tirelessly spent the rest of his life preaching, healing and comforting the many souls that came to see him.\n\n===Ibn Arabi===\nMuhyiddin Muhammad b.

His writings, especially al-Futuhat al-Makkiyya and Fusus al-hikam, have been studied within all the Sufi orders as the clearest expression of ''tawhid'' (Divine Unity), though because of their recondite nature they were often only given to initiates. Later those who followed his teaching became known as the school of ''wahdat al-wujud'' (the Oneness of Being). He himself considered his writings to have been divinely inspired. As he expressed the Way to one of his close disciples, his legacy is that 'you should never ever abandon your servant-hood (''\u02bfubudiyya''), and that there may never be in your soul a longing for any existing thing'.<ref>K. al-Wasa'il, quoted in ''The Unlimited Mercifier'', Stephen Hirtenstein, p. 246</ref>\n\n===Junayd of Baghdad===\n[[Junayd of Baghdad|Junayd al-Baghdadi]] (830\u2013910) was one of the great early Sufis. His order was Junaidia, which links to the golden chain of many Sufi orders. He laid the groundwork for sober mysticism in contrast to that of God-intoxicated Sufis like al-Hallaj, Bayazid Bastami and Abusaeid Abolkheir. During the trial of al-Hallaj, his former disciple, the Caliph of the time demanded his fatwa. In response, he issued this fatwa: \"From the outward appearance he is to die and we judge according to the outward appearance and God knows better\". He is referred to by Sufis as Sayyid-ut Taifa\u2014i.e., the leader of the group. He lived and died in the city of Baghdad.\n\n===Mansur Al-Hallaj===\n[[Mansur Al-Hallaj]] (died 922) is renowned for his claim, ''Ana-l-Haqq'' (\"I am The Truth\"). His refusal to recant this utterance, which was regarded as [[apostasy]], led to a long trial. He was imprisoned for 11 years in a Baghdad prison, before being tortured and publicly dismembered on March 26, 922. He is still revered by Sufis for his willingness to embrace torture and death rather than recant. It is said that during his prayers, he would say \"O Lord! You are the guide of those who are passing through the Valley of Bewilderment. If I am a heretic, enlarge my heresy\".<ref>Memoirs of the Saints, p.108.{{fcn|date=February 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Moinuddin Chishti===\n[[File:Sufi Prayer Book LACMA M.87.21.jpg|thumb|A Mughal-era Sufi prayer book from the Chishti order]]\n\n[[Moinuddin Chishti|Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti]] was born in 1141 and died in 1236.

Moinuddin Chisht\u012b turned towards India, reputedly after a dream in which Muhammad blessed him to do so. After a brief stay at Lahore, he reached [[Ajmer]] along with Sultan [[Muhammad of Ghor|Shah\u0101b-ud-Din Muhammad Ghori]], and settled down there. In Ajmer, he attracted a substantial following, acquiring a great deal of respect amongst the residents of the city. Moinuddin Chisht\u012b practiced the Sufi ''Sulh-e-Kul'' (peace to all) concept to promote understanding between Muslims and non-Muslims.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n===Rabi'a al-'Adawiyya===\n[[File:Rabia al-Adawiyya.jpg|thumb|right|Depiction of Rabi'a [[Mill (grinding)|grinding grain]] from a [[Persian language|Persian]] dictionary]]\n\n[[Rabi'a al-'Adawiyya]] or Rabia of Basra (died 801) was a mystic who represents countercultural elements of Sufism, especially with regards to the status and power of women.

Sufis often visit the shrine for [[ziyarat]], a term associated with religious visits and pilgrimages. Dargahs are often associated with Sufi eating and meeting rooms and hostels, called ''[[khanqah]]'' or hospices.

There is evidence that Sufism did influence the development of some schools of Jewish philosophy and ethics. In the first writing of this kind, we see \"Kitab al-Hidayah ila Fara'i\u1e0d al-\u1e32ulub\", ''[[Duties of the Heart]]'', of [[Bahya ibn Paquda]]. This book was translated by [[Judah ibn Tibbon]] into [[Hebrew]] under the title \"\u1e24\u014d\u1e07\u014d\u1e6f Ha-lle\u1e07\u0101\u1e07\u014d\u1e6f\".<ref>''A Sufi-Jewish Dialogue: Philosophy and Mysticism in Bahya ibn Paquda's Duties of the Heart'', Diana Lobel</ref>{{quote|The precepts prescribed by the [[Torah]] number 613 only; those dictated by the intellect are innumerable.}}\n\nIt is noteworthy that in the ethical writings of the Sufis [[Al-Kusajri]] and [[Harawi (genre)|Al-Harawi]] there are sections which treat of the same subjects as those treated in the \"\u1e24ovot ha-Lebabot\" and which bear the same titles: e.g., \"Bab al-Tawakkul\"; \"Bab al-Taubah\"; \"Bab al-Mu\u1e25asabah\"; \"Bab al-Tawa\u1e0du'\"; \"Bab al-Zuhd\". In the ninth gate, Ba\u1e25ya directly quotes sayings of the Sufis, whom he calls ''Perushim''. However, the author of the ''\u1e24\u014d\u1e07\u014d\u1e6f Ha-lle\u1e07\u0101\u1e07\u014d\u1e6f'' did not go so far as to approve of the asceticism of the Sufis, although he showed a marked predilection for their ethical principles.\n\n[[Avraham son of Rambam|Abraham ben Moses ben Maimon]], the son of the Jewish philosopher [[Maimonides]], believed that Sufi practices and doctrines continue the tradition of the Biblical prophets. See Sefer Hammaspiq, \"Happerishuth\", Chapter 11 (\"Ha-mma\u02bfa\u1e07\u0101q\") s.v. hithbonen efo be-masoreth mufla'a zo, citing the Talmudic explanation of Jeremiah 13:27 in Chagigah 5b; in Rabbi Yaakov Wincelberg's translation, \"The Way of Serving God\" (Feldheim), p.&nbsp;429 and above, p.&nbsp;427. Also see ibid., Chapter 10 (\"Iqqu\u1e07im\"), s.v. wa-halo yo\u1e0fe\u02bea\u02bf atta; in \"The Way of Serving God\", p.&nbsp;371.\n\nAbraham Maimuni's principal work is originally composed in [[Judeo-Arabic]] and entitled \"\u05db\u05ea\u05d0\u05d1 \u05db\u05e4\u05d0\u05d9\u05d4 \u05d0\u05dc\u05e2\u05d0\u05d1\u05d3\u05d9\u05df\" ''Kit\u0101b Kif\u0101yah al-'\u0100bid\u012bn'' (\"A Comprehensive Guide for the Servants of God\"). From the extant surviving portion it is conjectured that Maimuni's treatise was three times as long as his father's Guide for the Perplexed. In the book, Maimuni evidences a great appreciation for, and affinity to, Sufism. Followers of his path continued to foster a Jewish-Sufi form of pietism for at least a century, and he is rightly considered the founder of this pietistic school, which was centered in [[Egypt]].\n\nThe followers of this path, which they called, interchangeably, Hasidism (not to be confused with the [later] [[Jewish]] [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] movement) or Sufism (''Tasawwuf''), practiced spiritual retreats, solitude, fasting and sleep deprivation. The Jewish Sufis maintained their own [[Sufi order|brotherhood]], guided by a religious leader\u2014like a Sufi [[sheikh]].<ref name=\"revues\">{{cite web|url=http://bcrfj.revues.org/index2312.html |title=Jewish pietism of the Sufi type |author=Mireille Loubet |publisher=bcrfj.revues.org|accessdate=26 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] in its entry on Sufism states that the revival of Jewish mysticism in Muslim countries is probably due to the spread of Sufism in the same geographical areas. The entry details many parallels to Sufic concepts found in the writings of prominent Kabbalists during the [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Jewish Encyclopedia |date=1906 |volume=11 |pages=579\u2013581 |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/}}</ref>{{sfn|Shah|1970|p=14-15}}\n\n==In popular culture==\n\n===Music===\n\nIn 2005, Indian musician [[Rabbi Shergill]] released a Sufi rock song called \"[[Bulla Ki Jaana]]\", which became a chart-topper in India and Pakistan.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1050604/asp/calcutta/story_4806895.asp|title=Soundscape for the soul|author=Zeeshan Jawed|work=[[The Telegraph (Kolkata)|The Telegraph]]|location=[[Kolkata|Calcutta]]|date=4 June 2005|accessdate=23 April 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2005/04/11/stories/2005041100540100.htm|title=Urban balladeer|work=[[The Hindu]]|author=Bageshree S.|date=26 March 2005|accessdate=23 April 2008|location=Chennai, India}}</ref>\n\n=== Literature ===\nThe 13th century Persian poet [[Rumi]], is considered one of the most influential figures of Sufism, as well as one of the greatest poets of all time.

The film was written by [[Jeffrey Alan Schechter|Jeff Schechter]] and directed by [[Greg Beeman]]. The film stars [[Erik von Detten]] as Andy \"Brink\" Brinker, a high school inline skater who joins a group of sponsored aggressive inline skaters to earn money to help his financially troubled family. The film is considered a modern and loosely based adaptation of [[Mary Mapes Dodge]]'s 1865 novel ''[[Hans Brinker, or The Silver Skates]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Erickson |first=Hal |title=Brink!

Boomer, a skater for Team X-Bladz, is seriously injured during the race, while Brink and Val are both caught and suspended, leading to Val being fined $350,000 by Team X-Bladz. Brink learns that his family is in financial trouble; his father, Ralph, has been on [[Disability pension|disability]] for six months. Brink secretly goes against what he believes and joins Team X-Bladz for $200 a week, as a replacement for Boomer. Ralph gets him a part-time job at Pup-N-Suds, a dog grooming business. This, however, is a job which Jordy, Gabriella, and Peter are aware of because Brink had told them that he's working there. For a while, Brink manages to keep his other job in Team X-Bladz a secret from his family and friends by assuming different costumes. However, Jordy, Gabriella, and Peter discover the truth when they catch him skating for Team X-Bladz to at an invitational prior to an upcoming local competition. Brink's friends feel he betrayed them and choose to ignore him upon discovering his alignment with Team X-Bladz. \n\nBrink tries to rejoin the Soul Skaters, but is rebuffed. Val offers Brink a chance to re-join X-Bladz by noting the team won't hold him leaving against him. While scouting the route for the downhill leg of the upcoming competition, The Soul-Skaters and Team X-Bladz agree to a downhill race, with Gabriella against Brink. During the race, Val sabotages Gabriella course by tossing gravel onto the road - but tells Brink to take a different route. Gabriella wipes out big and sustains cuts and bruises.  As Val attempts to express his sorrow for what had happened, Brink tells Val to not be a wuss. At this point, all of the Soul-Skaters disown Brink as their friend; they call him a sell-out and stop talking to him. Boomer encourages Brink to leave X-Bladz and go back to his friends while he still. \n\nBrink visits Gabriella at her house and she calls him a sell-out. Ralph learns about the accident and Brink's position on Team X-Bladz from Gabriella's mother. In the garage, he has a heart-to-heart with Brink and asks him why he didn't tell the family about it. Brink finally confesses his true reasons for joining Team X-Bladz and wanting to be a somebody from it. He admits that though he got what he wanted, it has gotten him into a mess. Brink mentions he has lost his friends and doesn't have fun skating with X-Bladz. Ralph reveals that although the family is in financial trouble, Brink should not be skating fun and that your job doesn't define you.\n\nInspired by his father, Brink confronts Val at the local boardwalk, quits Team X-Bladz, and returns the team gear (skates / helmet). Val tells Brink to not renege on his contractual obligations with Team X-Bladz. This leads to a heated argument between both boys and Brink to toss a milkshake in Val's face. \n\nIn the days before the competition, Brink meets his friends at the skate yard. After giving them new skates, Brink tells them of his plan to sponsor the team under the name \"Team Pup 'N Suds\". When questioned, Brink admits he got an advance from PupNSuds from his wages to pay for the skates. They forgive Brink and accept him as their friend again.\n\nAs friends once again, they compete in the competition with their families' support. In the end, it comes down to Brink and Val in the championship race. Throughout the downhill championship, Val continually attempts to shove Brink off the course. When Val crashes off the course, Brink returns to help him up. Val yanks Brink to the ground to try to get a head start, while ESPN cameras stream the interaction to onlookers. After getting up, with Val in the lead, Brink takes a shortcut to win the race.\n\nImmediately after the race, while Val is disqualified and storms off, Team X-Bladz manager, Jimmy, who saw Val's cheating and kicked him off the team, offers Brink a spot on Team X-Bladz. However, Brink declines. He happily re-joins the Soul Skaters and receives the trophy.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Erik von Detten]] \u2013 Andy \"Brink\" Brinker\n* Sam Horrigan \u2013 Val\n* [[Christina Vidal]] \u2013 Gabriella Dellama\n* [[Robin Riker]] \u2013 Maddie Brinker\n* [[Geoffrey Blake (actor)|Geoffrey Blake]] \u2013 Jimmy\n* [[Patrick Levis]] \u2013 Peter Calhoun\n* Joey Simmrin \u2013 Arne \"Worm\"\n* Asher Gold \u2013 Jordy\n* [[Walter Emanuel Jones]] \u2013 Boomer\n* [[Katie Volding]] \u2013 Kate Brinker\n* [[David Graf]] \u2013 Ralph Brinker\n* [[Kevin Clifford]] \u2014 Garbage Man\n\n==Soundtracks==\nOriginal music composed by [[J.

In 1951 Hugo obtained a [[99-year lease]] on a [[Branson, Missouri]] area attraction called [[Marvel Cave]]. Hugo suffered a heart attack and later died in 1955, however Mary along with her two sons continued to improve the cave attraction by installing electric lighting and building cement walkways. A cable train was installed in 1958 to ferry guests out of the depths of the cave upon the end of the tour. The attendance nearly doubled and a small frontier town was erected to entertain visitors as they waited for their cave tour. In order to increase attendance furthermore at the attraction, a gimmick was used by naming the village \"[[Silver Dollar City]]\" and distributing [[Dollar (United States coin)|silver dollars]] as change to every visitor in hope that when they would spend the rare coins they would tell people where they had got them from. The idea was a success, and the Herschend family soon found themselves involved in the theme park business.\n\nIn 1969, Silver Dollar City drew national attention when producer [[Paul Henning]] brought the cast and crew of the popular ''[[Beverly Hillbillies]]'' television show to the park to film five episodes.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nThe park is also home to many bats which the park takes measures to try and protect from diseases that could prove fatal.\n\nIn 2010, Herschend Family Entertainment was featured on the reality TV series ''[[Undercover Boss]]''.\n\nThe company also co-owns and co-operates with partners [[Dolly Parton]] and her company The Dollywood Company, the dinner and theatre company Pirates Voyage Dinner and Show in [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gadling.com/2011/06/06/dolly-partons-pirates-voyage-replaces-dixie-stampede-in-myr/ |title=Dolly Parton's 'Pirates Voyage' replaces 'Dixie Stampede' in Myrtle Beach |publisher=Gadling |date=June 6, 2011 |accessdate=July 24, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=MyrtleBeach.comSeptember 23, 2010 |url=http://www.myrtlebeach.com/blog/curtain-to-close-on-myrtle-beachs-dixie-stampede/ |title=Curtain to close on Myrtle Beach's Dixie today Stampede |publisher=MyrtleBeach.com |date=September 23, 2010 |accessdate=July 24, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/entertainment/article16657346.html |title=Pirates Voyage all settled in former Dixie Stampede location, enjoying holiday shows &#124; Myrtle Beach Sun News |publisher=Myrtlebeachonline.com |date=December 20, 2013 |accessdate=July 24, 2017}}</ref> and Dolly Parton's Stampede (formerly Dixie Stampede).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2008-01-08/news/stampede08_1_parton-dixie-dixie-stampede-pigeon-forge |title=Dolly Parton's Dixie Stampede dinner theater in Orlando sold, closed - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel |publisher=Articles.orlandosentinel.com |date=January 8, 2008 |accessdate=July 24, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"soldorlando\">{{cite news| title=Orlando's Dixie Stampede shuts down| last=Blake| first=Scott| publisher=Florida Today| url=http://www.floridatoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080108/BUSINESS/301080002/1003| archiveurl=http://www.floridatoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080108/BUSINESS/301080002/1003| date=January 8, 2008| archivedate=January 19, 2008| accessdate=March 23, 2011}}</ref><ref name=Stampede/>\n\n==Current properties==\n\n===Amusement parks===\n\n====Owned/operated====\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:170px;\"| Name\n! style=\"width:150px;\"| Location\n!

The following year the attraction was renamed Silver Dollar City Tennessee as part of a development plan to transform the property into a theme park patterned after the original Silver Dollar City in Branson. For the Pigeon Forge park, the [[Ozark Mountains]] theme of the original Silver Dollar City was slightly reworked to represent the [[Great Smoky Mountains]] and [[Appalachia|Appalachia culture]] instead, fitting the location in the foothills of the Smokies.\n\nIn 1986, singer and actress [[Dolly Parton]], who grew up near Pigeon Forge, became a co-owner, and the park's name was changed to [[Dollywood]], reflecting her involvement. At this point, the Pigeon Forge park was branched off into a separate division of HFE called The Dollywood Company, which oversees all the properties that Dolly Parton has interest in.<ref>[http://www.dollywood.com/company-info/about.aspx About Dollywood: Company Information: Dollywood<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n \nAlong with the Herschend family, Dolly Parton co-owns the Dolly Parton's Stampede (formerly [[Dixie Stampede]]<ref name=Stampede>{{cite news|url=http://www.citizen-times.com/story/entertainment/2018/01/09/dolly-partons-dixie-stampede-gets-name-change-now-called-stampede/1017388001/|title=Dolly Parton's Dixie Stampede gets name change, now called Stampede|last=Jones|first=Maggie|work=[[USA Today]]|date=January 9, 2018|accessdate=January 9, 2018}}</ref>) dinner attraction chain, which has locations in Pigeon Forge (opened 1988), [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina|Myrtle Beach]] (1992), and Branson (1995). A location in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] opened in 2003 and closed in early 2008.\n\nIn 2001 a new water park was opened adjacent to the Dollywood theme park called [[Dollywood's Splash Country]].\n\n==Past properties==\nHFE built several water parks in the 1980s which have since sold to other companies such as [[Wet 'n Wild (brand)|Wet 'n Wild]], [[Frontier City]], and [[Six Flags]]. White Water Branson, built in 1980, was the forerunner and is still owned by HFE; while the White Waters in [[White Water Bay (Oklahoma)|Oklahoma City]] (1981), [[Boardwalk Fun Park|Grand Prairie, Texas]] (1982), [[Garland, Texas]] (1982) and [[Six Flags White Water|Atlanta]] (1983) have been sold.\n\nThe 4,000 seat [[Grand Palace Theatre]] opened in 1992 by the Herschends. The theatre was co-owned by singer [[Kenny Rogers]]. Along with Rogers headliners were [[Glen Campbell]], [[Louise Mandrell]] and [[Barbara Mandrell]]. In 1994 HFE entered into a ten-year contract with Radio City Entertainment. The Grand Palace Theatre would be the first to host the [[Radio City Christmas Spectacular]] starring the world famous [[The Rockettes|Rockettes]] outside of [[New York City]]\u2019s [[Radio City Music Hall]]. The shows were successful and led to Radio City Entertainment launching tours of their shows in other cities throughout the United States.\n\nHFE built the $10 million Grand Village Shops with [[Kenny Rogers]] adjacent to The Grand Palace Theatre in 1993. Ozark wares and English [[bone china]] filled the twenty six [[New Orleans]] themed shops. HFE later bought out entertainer Kenny Rogers and sold The Grand Palace in 1996 and The Grand Village in 2005.\n\nAmerican Adventures, a children's theme park opened alongside [[Six Flags White Water|White Water Atlanta]]. The park was sold to [[Six Flags]] in 1999.\n\nIn 1994, The Dollywood Company constructed a large music theatre in Pigeon Forge called Music Mansion.

In 2005 the theatre was sold again and converted to a [[WonderWorks (attraction)|WonderWorks]] location. A Music Mansion Theatre was planned for Myrtle Beach, but never materialized.\n\nIn 2003 the Dollywood Company opened a new Dixie Stampede location in [[Orlando, Florida]] along [[Interstate 4]]. The location operated until early 2008, when the property was sold to [[Simon Property Group]] for an undisclosed amount. The building was torn down, and an extension of the Orlando Vineland Premium Outlets was built on the land. HFE has plans to build another Dixie Stampede in the region at some point, though specific plans have not been disclosed.<ref>[http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/orl-dixie0908jan09,0,451819.story Orlando Premium Outlets' owner buys Dixie Stampede - OrlandoSentinel.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn 2004 HFE purchased the [[Hawaiian Falls]] water parks located in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Garland, Texas|Garland]] and [[The Colony, Texas]].

At this point, the Pigeon Forge park was branched off into a separate division of HFE called The Dollywood Company, which oversees all the properties that Dolly Parton has interest in.<ref>[http://www.dollywood.com/company-info/about.aspx About Dollywood: Company Information: Dollywood<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n \nAlong with the Herschend family, Dolly Parton co-owns the Dolly Parton's Stampede (formerly [[Dixie Stampede]]<ref name=Stampede>{{cite news|url=http://www.citizen-times.com/story/entertainment/2018/01/09/dolly-partons-dixie-stampede-gets-name-change-now-called-stampede/1017388001/|title=Dolly Parton's Dixie Stampede gets name change, now called Stampede|last=Jones|first=Maggie|work=[[USA Today]]|date=January 9, 2018|accessdate=January 9, 2018}}</ref>) dinner attraction chain, which has locations in Pigeon Forge (opened 1988), [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina|Myrtle Beach]] (1992), and Branson (1995). A location in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] opened in 2003 and closed in early 2008.\n\nIn 2001 a new water park was opened adjacent to the Dollywood theme park called [[Dollywood's Splash Country]].\n\n==Past properties==\nHFE built several water parks in the 1980s which have since sold to other companies such as [[Wet 'n Wild (brand)|Wet 'n Wild]], [[Frontier City]], and [[Six Flags]]. White Water Branson, built in 1980, was the forerunner and is still owned by HFE; while the White Waters in [[White Water Bay (Oklahoma)|Oklahoma City]] (1981), [[Boardwalk Fun Park|Grand Prairie, Texas]] (1982), [[Garland, Texas]] (1982) and [[Six Flags White Water|Atlanta]] (1983) have been sold.\n\nThe 4,000 seat [[Grand Palace Theatre]] opened in 1992 by the Herschends. The theatre was co-owned by singer [[Kenny Rogers]]. Along with Rogers headliners were [[Glen Campbell]], [[Louise Mandrell]] and [[Barbara Mandrell]]. In 1994 HFE entered into a ten-year contract with Radio City Entertainment. The Grand Palace Theatre would be the first to host the [[Radio City Christmas Spectacular]] starring the world famous [[The Rockettes|Rockettes]] outside of [[New York City]]\u2019s [[Radio City Music Hall]]. The shows were successful and led to Radio City Entertainment launching tours of their shows in other cities throughout the United States.\n\nHFE built the $10 million Grand Village Shops with [[Kenny Rogers]] adjacent to The Grand Palace Theatre in 1993. Ozark wares and English [[bone china]] filled the twenty six [[New Orleans]] themed shops. HFE later bought out entertainer Kenny Rogers and sold The Grand Palace in 1996 and The Grand Village in 2005.\n\nAmerican Adventures, a children\u2019s theme park opened alongside [[Six Flags White Water|White Water Atlanta]]. The park was sold to [[Six Flags]] in 1999.\n\nIn 1994, The Dollywood Company constructed a large music theatre in Pigeon Forge called Music Mansion. Headlined by James Rogers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jamesrogersonline.com/home.html |title=Welcome to James Rogers Online |publisher=Jamesrogersonline.com |accessdate=January 23, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209123830/http://www.jamesrogersonline.com/home.html |archivedate=February 9, 2012 }}</ref> the highly successful theatre was operated by HFE until 2001, when it was sold to [[Anita Bryant]]. In 2005 the theatre was sold again and converted to a [[WonderWorks (attraction)|WonderWorks]] location. A Music Mansion Theatre was planned for Myrtle Beach, but never materialized.\n\nIn 2003 the Dollywood Company opened a new Dixie Stampede location in [[Orlando, Florida]] along [[Interstate 4]]. The location operated until early 2008, when the property was sold to [[Simon Property Group]] for an undisclosed amount. The building was torn down, and an extension of the Orlando Vineland Premium Outlets was built on the land. HFE has plans to build another Dixie Stampede in the region at some point, though specific plans have not been disclosed.<ref>[http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/orl-dixie0908jan09,0,451819.story Orlando Premium Outlets' owner buys Dixie Stampede - OrlandoSentinel.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn 2004 HFE purchased the [[Hawaiian Falls]] water parks located in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Garland, Texas|Garland]] and [[The Colony, Texas]]. In 2006 all three parks were sold.\n\nDue to unreliable peak season water access, Ride The Ducks in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] closed in 2007.\n\n[[Celebration City]] in Branson closed on October 25, 2008. The company has plans to restructure the site.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official|http://www.hfecorp.com/}}\n\n{{HFEC}}\n{{Dolly Parton}}\n[[Category:Amusement park companies]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Atlanta]]\n[[Category:Herschend Family Entertainment| ]]\n[[Category:Stone Mountain]]\n", "name_user": "Kaltenmeyer", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herschend_Family_Entertainment"}
