Quantum circuits are based on the quantum bit, or \"[[qubit]]\", which is somewhat analogous to the [[bit]] in classical computation. Qubits can be in a 1 or 0 [[quantum state]], or they can be in a [[quantum superposition|superposition]] of the 1 and 0 states. However, when qubits are measured the result is always either a 0 or a 1; the [[Probability|probabilities]] of these two outcomes depend on the [[quantum state]] that they were in immediately prior to the measurement. Computation is performed by manipulating qubits with [[quantum logic gate]]s, which are somewhat analogous to [[logic gate|classical logic gates]].\n\n<!--Physical implementations-->\nThere are currently two main approaches to physically implementing a quantum computer: analog and digital. Analog approaches are further divided into [[quantum simulator|quantum simulation]], [[quantum annealing]], and [[adiabatic quantum computation]]. Digital quantum computers use [[quantum logic gate]]s to do computation. Both approaches use quantum bits or [[qubit]]s.<ref name=2018Report/>{{rp|2\u201313}}\n\n<!-- Computability and complexity -->\nThe study of the [[computational complexity]] of problems with respect to quantum computers is known as [[quantum complexity theory]]. While all [[computational problem]]s solvable by quantum computers are also solvable by classical computers (and conversely all problems solvable by classical computers are also solvable by quantum computers), quantum computers are believed to be able to solve certain problems significantly faster than classical computers. This means that while quantum computers provide no additional power over classical computers when it comes to which problems can, in principle, be solved, they do provide additional power when it comes to the [[time complexity]] of certain problems. Notably, quantum computers are believed to be able to quickly solve certain problems that no classical computer can solve in ''any feasible amount of time''\u2014a feat known as \"[[quantum supremacy]]\".\n\n== Quantum operations ==\n[[File:Bloch Sphere.svg|thumb|The [[Bloch sphere]] is a representation of a [[qubit]], the fundamental building block of quantum computers.]]\n\nThe prevailing model of quantum computation describes the computation in terms of a network of [[quantum logic gate]]s.<ref name=\"Nielson-Chuang\">{{Cite book|title=Quantum Computation and Quantum Information: 10th Anniversary Edition|last=Nielsen|first=Michael A.|last2=Chuang|first2=Isaac L.|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511976667|location=Cambridge|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511976667|url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/465953}}</ref>\n\nA memory consisting of <math display=\"inline\">n</math> bits of information has <math display=\"inline\">2^n</math> possible states. A vector representing all memory states thus has <math display=\"inline\">2^n</math> entries (one for each state). This vector is viewed as a ''[[probability vector]]'' and represents the fact that the memory is to be found in a particular state.\n\nIn the classical view, one entry would have a value of 1 (i.e. a 100% probability of being in this state) and all other entries would be zero.  \nIn quantum mechanics, probability vectors are generalized to [[Density matrix|density operators]]. This is the technically rigorous [[Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics|mathematical foundation for quantum logic gates]], but the intermediate quantum state vector formalism is usually introduced first because it is conceptually simpler. This article focuses on the quantum state vector formalism for simplicity.\n\nWe begin by considering a simple memory consisting of only one bit. This memory may be found in one of two states: the zero state or the one state. We may represent the state of this memory using [[Bra\u2013ket notation|Dirac notation]] so that\n<math display=\"block\">\n |0\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix};\\quad\n |1\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\nA quantum memory may then be found in any quantum superposition <math display=\"inline\">|\\psi\\rangle</math> of the two classical states <math display=\"inline\">|0\\rangle</math> and <math display=\"inline\">|1\\rangle</math>:\n<math display=\"block\">\n |\\psi\\rangle := \\alpha\\,|0\\rangle + \\beta\\,|1\\rangle\n               = \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha \\\\ \\beta \\end{pmatrix};\\quad\n |\\alpha|^2 + |\\beta|^2 = 1.\n</math>\nIn general, the coefficients <math display=\"inline\">\\alpha</math> and <math display=\"inline\">\\beta</math> are [[complex number]]s. In this scenario, one [[qubit]] of information is said to be encoded into the quantum memory. The state <math display=\"inline\">|\\psi\\rangle</math> is not itself a probability vector but can be connected with a probability vector via a measurement operation. If the quantum memory is measured to determine if the state is <math display=\"inline\">|0\\rangle</math> or <math display=\"inline\">|1\\rangle</math> (this is known as a computational basis measurement), the zero state would be observed with probability <math display=\"inline\">|\\alpha|^2</math> and the one state with probability <math display=\"inline\">|\\beta|^2</math>. The numbers <math display=\"inline\">\\alpha</math> and <math display=\"inline\">\\beta</math> are called [[Probability amplitude|quantum amplitudes]].\n\nThe state of this one-qubit quantum memory can be manipulated by applying [[quantum logic gate]]s, analogous to how classical memory can be manipulated with [[Logic gate|classical logic gates]]. One important gate for both classical and quantum computation is the NOT gate, which can be represented by a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]\n<math display=\"block\">X := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}.</math>\nMathematically, the application of such a logic gate to a quantum state vector is modelled with [[matrix multiplication]]. Thus <math display=\"inline\">X|0\\rangle = |1\\rangle</math> and <math display=\"inline\">X|1\\rangle = |0\\rangle</math>.\n\nThe mathematics of single qubit gates can be extended to operate on multiqubit quantum memories in two important ways. One way is simply to select a qubit and apply that gate to the target qubit whilst leaving the remainder of the memory unaffected. Another way is to apply the gate to its target only if another part of the memory is in a desired state. These two choices can be illustrated using another example. The possible states of a two-qubit quantum memory are\n<math display=\"block\">\n |00\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix};\\quad\n |01\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix};\\quad\n |10\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix};\\quad\n |11\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}.\n</math>\nThe CNOT gate can then be represented using the following matrix:\n<math display=\"block\">\n CNOT :=\n \\begin{pmatrix}\n   1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n   0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n   0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n   0 & 0 & 1 & 0\n \\end{pmatrix}.\n</math>\nAs a mathematical consequence of this definition, <math display=\"inline\">CNOT|00\\rangle = |00\\rangle</math>, <math display=\"inline\">CNOT|01\\rangle = |01\\rangle</math>, <math display=\"inline\">CNOT|10\\rangle = |11\\rangle</math>, and <math display=\"inline\">CNOT|11\\rangle = |10\\rangle</math>. In other words, the CNOT applies a NOT gate (<math display=\"inline\">X</math> from before) to the second qubit if and only if the first qubit is in the state <math display=\"inline\">|1\\rangle</math>. If the first qubit is <math display=\"inline\">|0\\rangle</math>, nothing is done to either qubit.\n\nIn summary, a quantum computation can be described as a network of quantum logic gates and measurements. Any measurement can be deferred to the end of a quantum computation, though this deferment may come at a computational cost. Because of this possibility of deferring a measurement, most [[quantum circuit]]s depict a network consisting only of quantum logic gates and no measurements. More information can be found in the following articles: [[universal quantum computer]], [[Shor's algorithm]], [[Grover's algorithm]], [[Deutsch\u2013Jozsa algorithm]], [[amplitude amplification]], [[quantum Fourier transform]], [[quantum gate]], [[Adiabatic quantum computation|quantum adiabatic algorithm]] and [[quantum error correction]].\n\nAny quantum computation can be represented as a network of quantum logic gates from a fairly small family of gates. A choice of gate family that enables this construction is known as a [[Quantum logic gate#Universal quantum gates|universal gate set]]. One common such set includes all single-qubit gates as well as the CNOT gate from above. This means any quantum computation can be performed by executing a sequence of single-qubit gates together with CNOT gates. Though this gate set is infinite, it can be replaced with a finite gate set by appealing to the [[Solovay\u2013Kitaev theorem|Solovay-Kitaev theorem]].\n\n== Potential applications ==\n=== Cryptography ===\n{{Main|Quantum cryptography}}\n[[Integer factorization]], which underpins the security of [[public key cryptography|public key cryptographic]] systems, is believed to be computationally infeasible with an ordinary computer for large integers if they are the product of few [[prime number]]s (e.g., products of two 300-digit primes).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lenstra |first=Arjen K. |url=http://sage.math.washington.edu/edu/124/misc/arjen_lenstra_factoring.pdf |title=Integer Factoring |journal=Designs, Codes and Cryptography |volume=19 |pages=101\u2013128 |year=2000 |doi=10.1023/A:1008397921377 |issue=2/3 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410234239/http://sage.math.washington.edu/edu/124/misc/arjen_lenstra_factoring.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-10 }}</ref> By comparison, a quantum computer could efficiently solve this problem using [[Shor's algorithm]] to find its factors. This ability would allow a quantum computer to break many of the [[cryptography|cryptographic]] systems in use today, in the sense that there would be a [[polynomial time]] (in the number of digits of the integer) algorithm for solving the problem. In particular, most of the popular [[Asymmetric Algorithms|public key ciphers]] are based on the difficulty of factoring integers or the [[discrete logarithm]] problem, both of which can be solved by Shor's algorithm. In particular, the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]], [[Diffie\u2013Hellman]], and [[elliptic curve Diffie\u2013Hellman]] algorithms could be broken. These are used to protect secure Web pages, encrypted email, and many other types of data. Breaking these would have significant ramifications for electronic privacy and security.\n\nHowever, [[Post-quantum cryptography|other cryptographic algorithms]] do not appear to be broken by those algorithms.<ref name=\"pqcrypto_survey\">Daniel J.

The most well-known example of this is ''quantum database search'', which can be solved by [[Grover's algorithm]] using quadratically fewer queries to the database than that are required by classical algorithms. In this case, the advantage is not only provable but also optimal, it has been shown that Grover's algorithm gives the maximal possible probability of finding the desired element for any number of oracle lookups. Several other examples of provable quantum speedups for query problems have subsequently been discovered, such as for finding collisions in two-to-one functions and evaluating NAND trees.\n\nProblems that can be addressed with [[Grover's algorithm]] have the following properties:\n#There is no searchable structure in the collection of possible answers,\n#The number of possible answers to check is the same as the number of inputs to the algorithm, and\n#There exists a boolean function which evaluates each input and determines whether it is the correct answer\n\nFor problems with all these properties, the running time of [[Grover's algorithm]] on a quantum computer will scale as the square root of the number of inputs (or elements in the database), as opposed to the linear scaling of classical algorithms. A general class of problems to which [[Grover's algorithm]] can be applied<ref>{{Cite arxiv |eprint = quant-ph/0504012|last1 = Ambainis|first1 = Andris|title = Quantum search algorithms|year = 2005}}</ref> is [[Boolean satisfiability problem]]. In this instance, the ''database'' through which the algorithm is iterating is that of all possible answers. An example (and possible) application of this is a [[Password cracking|password cracker]] that attempts to guess the password or secret key for an [[encryption|encrypted]] file or system. [[Symmetric-key algorithm|Symmetric ciphers]] such as [[Triple DES]] and [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] are particularly vulnerable to this kind of attack.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} This application of quantum computing is a major interest of government agencies.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-seeks-to-build-quantum-computer-that-could-crack-most-types-of-encryption/2014/01/02/8fff297e-7195-11e3-8def-a33011492df2_story.html?hpid=z1 |title=NSA seeks to build quantum computer that could crack most types of encryption |first1=Steven |last1=Rich |first2=Barton |last2=Gellman |date=2014-02-01 |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref>\n\n=== Quantum simulation ===\n{{Main|Quantum simulator}}\nSince chemistry and nanotechnology rely on understanding quantum systems, and such systems are impossible to simulate in an efficient manner classically, many believe [[Quantum simulator|quantum simulation]] will be one of the most important applications of quantum computing.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://archive.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/02/72734 |title=The Father of Quantum Computing |journal=Wired |first=Quinn |last=Norton |date=2007-02-15 }}</ref> Quantum simulation could also be used to simulate the behavior of atoms and particles at unusual conditions such as the reactions inside a [[collider]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ias.edu/ias-letter/ambainis-quantum-computing |title=What Can We Do with a Quantum Computer? |first=Andris |last=Ambainis |date=Spring 2014 |publisher=Institute for Advanced Study}}</ref>\n\n=== Quantum annealing and adiabatic optimization ===\n[[Quantum annealing]] or [[Adiabatic quantum computation]] relies on the adiabatic theorem to undertake calculations.

This usually means isolating the system from its environment as interactions with the external world cause the system to decohere. However, other sources of decoherence also exist. Examples include the quantum gates, and the lattice vibrations and background thermonuclear spin of the physical system used to implement the qubits. Decoherence is irreversible, as it is effectively non-unitary, and is usually something that should be highly controlled, if not avoided. Decoherence times for candidate systems in particular, the transverse relaxation time ''T''<sub>2</sub> (for [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] and [[MRI]] technology, also called the ''dephasing time''), typically range between nanoseconds and seconds at low temperature.<ref name=\"DiVincenzo 1995\">{{cite journal |last=DiVincenzo |first=David P. |title=Quantum Computation |journal=Science |year=1995 |volume=270 |issue=5234 |pages=255\u2013261 |doi= 10.1126/science.270.5234.255 |bibcode = 1995Sci...270..255D |citeseerx=10.1.1.242.2165 }} {{subscription required}}</ref> Currently, some quantum computers require their qubits to be cooled to 20 millikelvins in order to prevent significant decoherence.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Nicola|title=Computing: The quantum company|journal=Nature|date=19 June 2013|volume=498|issue=7454|pages=286\u2013288|doi=10.1038/498286a|pmid=23783610|bibcode=2013Natur.498..286J}}</ref>\n\nAs a result, time-consuming tasks may render some quantum algorithms inoperable, as maintaining the state of qubits for a long enough duration will eventually corrupt the superpositions.<ref>{{cite arxiv|last1=Amy|first1=Matthew|last2=Matteo|first2=Olivia|last3=Gheorghiu|first3=Vlad|last4=Mosca|first4=Michele|last5=Parent|first5=Alex|last6=Schanck|first6=John|title=Estimating the cost of generic quantum pre-image attacks on SHA-2 and SHA-3|date=November 30, 2016|eprint=1603.09383|class=quant-ph}}</ref>\n\nThese issues are more difficult for optical approaches as the timescales are orders of magnitude shorter and an often-cited approach to overcoming them is optical [[pulse shaping]]. Error rates are typically proportional to the ratio of operating time to decoherence time, hence any operation must be completed much more quickly than the decoherence time.\n\nAs described in the [[Quantum threshold theorem]], if the error rate is small enough, it is thought to be possible to use quantum error correction to suppress errors and decoherence. This allows the total calculation time to be longer than the decoherence time if the error correction scheme can correct errors faster than decoherence introduces them. An often cited figure for the required error rate in each gate for fault-tolerant computation is 10<sup>\u22123</sup>, assuming the noise is depolarizing.\n\nMeeting this scalability condition is possible for a wide range of systems. However, the use of error correction brings with it the cost of a greatly increased number of required qubits. The number required to factor integers using Shor's algorithm is still polynomial, and thought to be between ''L'' and ''L''<sup>2</sup>, where ''L'' is the number of qubits in the number to be factored; error correction algorithms would inflate this figure by an additional factor of ''L''. For a 1000-bit number, this implies a need for about 10<sup>4</sup> bits without error correction.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Is Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation Really Possible? |last=Dyakonov |first=M.

Computation time is about ''L''<sup>2</sup> or about 10<sup>7</sup> steps and at 1&nbsp;MHz, about 10 seconds.\n\nA very different approach to the stability-decoherence problem is to create a [[topological quantum computer]] with [[anyon]]s, [[quasi-particle]]s used as threads and relying on [[braid theory]] to form stable logic gates.<ref>{{cite journal\n | last1 = Freedman | first1 = Michael H. | author1-link = Michael Freedman\n | last2 = Kitaev | first2 = Alexei | author2-link = Alexei Kitaev\n | last3 = Larsen | first3 = Michael J. | author3-link = Michael J.

More formally, BQP is the class of problems that can be solved by a polynomial-time [[quantum Turing machine]] with error probability of at most 1/3. As a class of probabilistic problems, BQP is the quantum counterpart to [[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]] (\"bounded error, probabilistic, polynomial time\"), the class of problems that can be efficiently solved by [[probabilistic Turing machine]]s with bounded error.<ref>Nielsen, p. 41</ref> It is known that BPP<math>\\subseteq</math>BQP and widely suspected, but not proven, that BQP<math>\\nsubseteq</math>BPP, which intuitively would mean that quantum computers are more powerful than classical computers in terms of time complexity.<ref>Nielsen, p. 201</ref>\n\n<!-- Relation of BQP to basic complexity classes -->\n[[File:BQP complexity class diagram.svg|thumb|The suspected relationship of BQP to several classical complexity classes.<ref>Nielsen, p. 42</ref>]]\nThe exact relationship of BQP to [[P (complexity)|P]], [[NP (complexity)|NP]], and [[PSPACE (complexity)|PSPACE]] is not known. However, it is known that P<math>\\subseteq</math>BQP<math>\\subseteq</math>PSPACE; that is, the class of problems that can be efficiently solved by quantum computers includes all problems that can be efficiently solved by deterministic classical computers but does not include any problems that cannot be solved by classical computers with polynomial space resources. It is further suspected that BQP is a strict superset of P, meaning there are problems that are efficiently solvable by quantum computers that are not efficiently solvable by deterministic classical computers. For instance, [[integer factorization]] and the [[discrete logarithm problem]] are known to be in BQP and are suspected to be outside of P. On the relationship of BQP to NP, little is known beyond the fact that some NP problems are in BQP (integer factorization and the discrete logarithm problem are both in NP, for example). It is suspected that NP<math>\\nsubseteq</math>BQP; that is, it is believed that there are efficiently checkable problems that are not efficiently solvable by a quantum computer. As a direct consequence of this belief, it is also suspected that BQP is disjoint from the class of [[NP-complete]] problems (if an NP-complete problem were in BQP, then it follows from [[NP-hard|NP-hardness]] that all problems in NP are in BQP).<ref name=BernVazi>{{cite journal |last1=Bernstein |first1=Ethan |last2=Vazirani |first2=Umesh |doi=10.1137/S0097539796300921 |title=Quantum Complexity Theory |year=1997 |pages=1411\u20131473 |volume=26 |journal=SIAM Journal on Computing |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/bv.ps |issue=5|citeseerx=10.1.1.144.7852 }}</ref>\n\n<!-- Summary of relationship to essential complexity classes -->\nThe relationship of BQP to the basic classical complexity classes can be summarized as:\n:<math>\\mathsf{P \\subseteq BPP \\subseteq BQP \\subseteq PP \\subseteq PSPACE}</math>\nIt is also known that BQP is contained in the complexity class ''[[Sharp-P|#P]]'' (or more precisely in the associated class of decision problems ''P<sup>#P</sup>''),<ref name=BernVazi>{{cite journal |last1=Bernstein |first1=Ethan |last2=Vazirani |first2=Umesh |doi=10.1137/S0097539796300921 |title=Quantum Complexity Theory |year=1997 |pages=1411\u20131473 |volume=26 |journal=SIAM Journal on Computing |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/bv.ps |issue=5|citeseerx=10.1.1.144.7852 }}</ref> which is a subclass of [[PSPACE]].\n\n<!-- Speculation about more advanced types of quantum computers -->\nIt has been speculated that further advances in physics could lead to even faster computers.

However, when qubits are measured the result is always either a 0 or a 1; the [[Probability|probabilities]] of these two outcomes depend on the [[quantum state]] that they were in immediately prior to the measurement.

We may represent the state of this memory using [[Bra\u2013ket notation|Dirac notation]] so that\n<math display=\"block\">\n |0\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix};\\quad\n |1\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\nA quantum memory may then be found in any quantum superposition <math display=\"inline\">|\\psi\\rangle</math> of the two classical states <math display=\"inline\">|0\\rangle</math> and <math display=\"inline\">|1\\rangle</math>:\n<math display=\"block\">\n |\\psi\\rangle := \\alpha\\,|0\\rangle + \\beta\\,|1\\rangle\n               = \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha \\\\ \\beta \\end{pmatrix};\\quad\n |\\alpha|^2 + |\\beta|^2 = 1.\n</math>\nIn general, the coefficients <math display=\"inline\">\\alpha</math> and <math display=\"inline\">\\beta</math> are [[complex number]]s. In this scenario, one [[qubit]] of information is said to be encoded into the quantum memory. The state <math display=\"inline\">|\\psi\\rangle</math> is not itself a probability vector but can be connected with a probability vector via a measurement operation. If the quantum memory is measured to determine if the state is <math display=\"inline\">|0\\rangle</math> or <math display=\"inline\">|1\\rangle</math> (this is known as a computational basis measurement), the zero state would be observed with probability <math display=\"inline\">|\\alpha|^2</math> and the one state with probability <math display=\"inline\">|\\beta|^2</math>. The numbers <math display=\"inline\">\\alpha</math> and <math display=\"inline\">\\beta</math> are called [[Probability amplitude|quantum amplitudes]].\n\nThe state of this one-qubit quantum memory can be manipulated by applying [[quantum logic gate]]s, analogous to how classical memory can be manipulated with [[Logic gate|classical logic gates]]. One important gate for both classical and quantum computation is the NOT gate, which can be represented by a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]\n<math display=\"block\">X := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}.</math>\nMathematically, the application of such a logic gate to a quantum state vector is modelled with [[matrix multiplication]]. Thus <math display=\"inline\">X|0\\rangle = |1\\rangle</math> and <math display=\"inline\">X|1\\rangle = |0\\rangle</math>.\n\nThe mathematics of single qubit gates can be extended to operate on multiqubit quantum memories in two important ways. One way is simply to select a qubit and apply that gate to the target qubit whilst leaving the remainder of the memory unaffected. Another way is to apply the gate to its target only if another part of the memory is in a desired state. These two choices can be illustrated using another example. The possible states of a two-qubit quantum memory are\n<math display=\"block\">\n |00\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix};\\quad\n |01\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix};\\quad\n |10\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix};\\quad\n |11\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}.\n</math>\nThe CNOT gate can then be represented using the following matrix:\n<math display=\"block\">\n CNOT :=\n \\begin{pmatrix}\n   1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n   0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n   0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n   0 & 0 & 1 & 0\n \\end{pmatrix}.\n</math>\nAs a mathematical consequence of this definition, <math display=\"inline\">CNOT|00\\rangle = |00\\rangle</math>, <math display=\"inline\">CNOT|01\\rangle = |01\\rangle</math>, <math display=\"inline\">CNOT|10\\rangle = |11\\rangle</math>, and <math display=\"inline\">CNOT|11\\rangle = |10\\rangle</math>. In other words, the CNOT applies a NOT gate (<math display=\"inline\">X</math> from before) to the second qubit if and only if the first qubit is in the state <math display=\"inline\">|1\\rangle</math>. If the first qubit is <math display=\"inline\">|0\\rangle</math>, nothing is done to either qubit.\n\nIn summary, a quantum computation can be described as a network of quantum logic gates and measurements. Any measurement can be deferred to the end of a quantum computation, though this deferment may come at a computational cost. Because of this possibility of deferring a measurement, most [[quantum circuit]]s depict a network consisting only of quantum logic gates and no measurements. More information can be found in the following articles: [[universal quantum computer]], [[Shor's algorithm]], [[Grover's algorithm]], [[Deutsch\u2013Jozsa algorithm]], [[amplitude amplification]], [[quantum Fourier transform]], [[quantum gate]], [[Adiabatic quantum computation|quantum adiabatic algorithm]] and [[quantum error correction]].\n\nAny quantum computation can be represented as a network of quantum logic gates from a fairly small family of gates. A choice of gate family that enables this construction is known as a [[Quantum logic gate#Universal quantum gates|universal gate set]]. One common such set includes all single-qubit gates as well as the CNOT gate from above. This means any quantum computation can be performed by executing a sequence of single-qubit gates together with CNOT gates. Though this gate set is infinite, it can be replaced with a finite gate set by appealing to the [[Solovay\u2013Kitaev theorem|Solovay-Kitaev theorem]].\n\n== Potential applications ==\n=== Cryptography ===\n{{Main|Quantum cryptography}}\n[[Integer factorization]], which underpins the security of [[public key cryptography|public key cryptographic]] systems, is believed to be computationally infeasible with an ordinary computer for large integers if they are the product of few [[prime number]]s (e.g., products of two 300-digit primes).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lenstra |first=Arjen K. |url=http://sage.math.washington.edu/edu/124/misc/arjen_lenstra_factoring.pdf |title=Integer Factoring |journal=Designs, Codes and Cryptography |volume=19 |pages=101\u2013128 |year=2000 |doi=10.1023/A:1008397921377 |issue=2/3 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410234239/http://sage.math.washington.edu/edu/124/misc/arjen_lenstra_factoring.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-10 }}</ref> By comparison, a quantum computer could efficiently solve this problem using [[Shor's algorithm]] to find its factors. This ability would allow a quantum computer to break many of the [[cryptography|cryptographic]] systems in use today, in the sense that there would be a [[polynomial time]] (in the number of digits of the integer) algorithm for solving the problem. In particular, most of the popular [[Asymmetric Algorithms|public key ciphers]] are based on the difficulty of factoring integers or the [[discrete logarithm]] problem, both of which can be solved by Shor's algorithm. In particular, the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]], [[Diffie\u2013Hellman]], and [[elliptic curve Diffie\u2013Hellman]] algorithms could be broken. These are used to protect secure Web pages, encrypted email, and many other types of data. Breaking these would have significant ramifications for electronic privacy and security.\n\nHowever, [[Post-quantum cryptography|other cryptographic algorithms]] do not appear to be broken by those algorithms.<ref name=\"pqcrypto_survey\">Daniel J.

The most well-known example of this is ''quantum database search'', which can be solved by [[Grover's algorithm]] using quadratically fewer queries to the database than that are required by classical algorithms. In this case, the advantage is not only provable but also optimal, it has been shown that Grover's algorithm gives the maximal possible probability of finding the desired element for any number of oracle lookups. Several other examples of provable quantum speedups for query problems have subsequently been discovered, such as for finding collisions in two-to-one functions and evaluating NAND trees.\n\nProblems that can be addressed with [[Grover's algorithm]] have the following properties:\n#There is no searchable structure in the collection of possible answers,\n#The number of possible answers to check is the same as the number of inputs to the algorithm, and\n#There exists a boolean function which evaluates each input and determines whether it is the correct answer\n\nFor problems with all these properties, the running time of [[Grover's algorithm]] on a quantum computer will scale as the square root of the number of inputs (or elements in the database), as opposed to the linear scaling of classical algorithms. A general class of problems to which [[Grover's algorithm]] can be applied<ref>{{Cite arxiv |eprint = quant-ph/0504012|last1 = Ambainis|first1 = Andris|title = Quantum search algorithms|year = 2005}}</ref> is [[Boolean satisfiability problem]]. In this instance, the ''database'' through which the algorithm is iterating is that of all possible answers. An example (and possible) application of this is a [[Password cracking|password cracker]] that attempts to guess the password or secret key for an [[encryption|encrypted]] file or system. [[Symmetric-key algorithm|Symmetric ciphers]] such as [[Triple DES]] and [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] are particularly vulnerable to this kind of attack.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} This application of quantum computing is a major interest of government agencies.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-seeks-to-build-quantum-computer-that-could-crack-most-types-of-encryption/2014/01/02/8fff297e-7195-11e3-8def-a33011492df2_story.html?hpid=z1 |title=NSA seeks to build quantum computer that could crack most types of encryption |first1=Steven |last1=Rich |first2=Barton |last2=Gellman |date=2014-02-01 |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref>\n\n=== Quantum simulation ===\n{{Main|Quantum simulator}}\nSince chemistry and nanotechnology rely on understanding quantum systems, and such systems are impossible to simulate in an efficient manner classically, many believe [[Quantum simulator|quantum simulation]] will be one of the most important applications of quantum computing.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://archive.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/02/72734 |title=The Father of Quantum Computing |journal=Wired |first=Quinn |last=Norton |date=2007-02-15 }}</ref> Quantum simulation could also be used to simulate the behavior of atoms and particles at unusual conditions such as the reactions inside a [[collider]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ias.edu/ias-letter/ambainis-quantum-computing |title=What Can We Do with a Quantum Computer? |first=Andris |last=Ambainis |date=Spring 2014 |publisher=Institute for Advanced Study}}</ref>\n\n=== Quantum annealing and adiabatic optimization ===\n[[Quantum annealing]] or [[Adiabatic quantum computation]] relies on the adiabatic theorem to undertake calculations.

This usually means isolating the system from its environment as interactions with the external world cause the system to decohere. However, other sources of decoherence also exist. Examples include the quantum gates, and the lattice vibrations and background thermonuclear spin of the physical system used to implement the qubits. Decoherence is irreversible, as it is effectively non-unitary, and is usually something that should be highly controlled, if not avoided. Decoherence times for candidate systems in particular, the transverse relaxation time ''T''<sub>2</sub> (for [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] and [[MRI]] technology, also called the ''dephasing time''), typically range between nanoseconds and seconds at low temperature.<ref name=\"DiVincenzo 1995\">{{cite journal |last=DiVincenzo |first=David P. |title=Quantum Computation |journal=Science |year=1995 |volume=270 |issue=5234 |pages=255\u2013261 |doi= 10.1126/science.270.5234.255 |bibcode = 1995Sci...270..255D |citeseerx=10.1.1.242.2165 }} {{subscription required}}</ref> Currently, some quantum computers require their qubits to be cooled to 20 millikelvins in order to prevent significant decoherence.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Nicola|title=Computing: The quantum company|journal=Nature|date=19 June 2013|volume=498|issue=7454|pages=286\u2013288|doi=10.1038/498286a|pmid=23783610|bibcode=2013Natur.498..286J}}</ref>\n\nAs a result, time-consuming tasks may render some quantum algorithms inoperable, as maintaining the state of qubits for a long enough duration will eventually corrupt the superpositions.<ref>{{cite arxiv|last1=Amy|first1=Matthew|last2=Matteo|first2=Olivia|last3=Gheorghiu|first3=Vlad|last4=Mosca|first4=Michele|last5=Parent|first5=Alex|last6=Schanck|first6=John|title=Estimating the cost of generic quantum pre-image attacks on SHA-2 and SHA-3|date=November 30, 2016|eprint=1603.09383|class=quant-ph}}</ref>\n\nThese issues are more difficult for optical approaches as the timescales are orders of magnitude shorter and an often-cited approach to overcoming them is optical [[pulse shaping]]. Error rates are typically proportional to the ratio of operating time to decoherence time, hence any operation must be completed much more quickly than the decoherence time.\n\nAs described in the [[Quantum threshold theorem]], if the error rate is small enough, it is thought to be possible to use quantum error correction to suppress errors and decoherence. This allows the total calculation time to be longer than the decoherence time if the error correction scheme can correct errors faster than decoherence introduces them. An often cited figure for the required error rate in each gate for fault-tolerant computation is 10<sup>\u22123</sup>, assuming the noise is depolarizing.\n\nMeeting this scalability condition is possible for a wide range of systems. However, the use of error correction brings with it the cost of a greatly increased number of required qubits. The number required to factor integers using Shor's algorithm is still polynomial, and thought to be between ''L'' and ''L''<sup>2</sup>, where ''L'' is the number of qubits in the number to be factored; error correction algorithms would inflate this figure by an additional factor of ''L''. For a 1000-bit number, this implies a need for about 10<sup>4</sup> bits without error correction.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Is Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation Really Possible? |last=Dyakonov |first=M.

More formally, BQP is the class of problems that can be solved by a polynomial-time [[quantum Turing machine]] with error probability of at most 1/3. As a class of probabilistic problems, BQP is the quantum counterpart to [[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]] (\"bounded error, probabilistic, polynomial time\"), the class of problems that can be efficiently solved by [[probabilistic Turing machine]]s with bounded error.<ref>Nielsen, p. 41</ref> It is known that BPP<math>\\subseteq</math>BQP and widely suspected, but not proven, that BQP<math>\\nsubseteq</math>BPP, which intuitively would mean that quantum computers are more powerful than classical computers in terms of time complexity.<ref>Nielsen, p. 201</ref>\n\n<!-- Relation of BQP to basic complexity classes -->\n[[File:BQP complexity class diagram.svg|thumb|The suspected relationship of BQP to several classical complexity classes.<ref>Nielsen, p. 42</ref>]]\nThe exact relationship of BQP to [[P (complexity)|P]], [[NP (complexity)|NP]], and [[PSPACE (complexity)|PSPACE]] is not known. However, it is known that P<math>\\subseteq</math>BQP<math>\\subseteq</math>PSPACE; that is, the class of problems that can be efficiently solved by quantum computers includes all problems that can be efficiently solved by deterministic classical computers but does not include any problems that cannot be solved by classical computers with polynomial space resources. It is further suspected that BQP is a strict superset of P, meaning there are problems that are efficiently solvable by quantum computers that are not efficiently solvable by deterministic classical computers. For instance, [[integer factorization]] and the [[discrete logarithm problem]] are known to be in BQP and are suspected to be outside of P. On the relationship of BQP to NP, little is known beyond the fact that some NP problems are in BQP (integer factorization and the discrete logarithm problem are both in NP, for example). It is suspected that NP<math>\\nsubseteq</math>BQP; that is, it is believed that there are efficiently checkable problems that are not efficiently solvable by a quantum computer. As a direct consequence of this belief, it is also suspected that BQP is disjoint from the class of [[NP-complete]] problems (if an NP-complete problem were in BQP, then it follows from [[NP-hard|NP-hardness]] that all problems in NP are in BQP).<ref name=BernVazi>{{cite journal |last1=Bernstein |first1=Ethan |last2=Vazirani |first2=Umesh |doi=10.1137/S0097539796300921 |title=Quantum Complexity Theory |year=1997 |pages=1411\u20131473 |volume=26 |journal=SIAM Journal on Computing |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/bv.ps |issue=5|citeseerx=10.1.1.144.7852 }}</ref>\n\n<!-- Summary of relationship to essential complexity classes -->\nThe relationship of BQP to the basic classical complexity classes can be summarized as:\n:<math>\\mathsf{P \\subseteq BPP \\subseteq BQP \\subseteq PP \\subseteq PSPACE}</math>\nIt is also known that BQP is contained in the complexity class ''[[Sharp-P|#P]]'' (or more precisely in the associated class of decision problems ''P<sup>#P</sup>''),<ref name=BernVazi>{{cite journal |last1=Bernstein |first1=Ethan |last2=Vazirani |first2=Umesh |doi=10.1137/S0097539796300921 |title=Quantum Complexity Theory |year=1997 |pages=1411\u20131473 |volume=26 |journal=SIAM Journal on Computing |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/bv.ps |issue=5|citeseerx=10.1.1.144.7852 }}</ref> which is a subclass of [[PSPACE]].\n\n<!-- Speculation about more advanced types of quantum computers -->\nIt has been speculated that further advances in physics could lead to even faster computers.

The largest one, with a few thousand followers, continues its activities under the name The Church of Heavenly Father (''Cheonbugyo'', {{lang|ko|\ucc9c\ubd80\uad50}}). The center of its doctrine and worship is the claim that Park is God, indeed the only true God, and that his spirit is present in The Church of Heavenly Father, where it can be perceived through a divine perfume and [[Ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]]-like manifestations.<ref name=\"Calgary\" />\n\nFounders of other successful Korean new religious movements were once members of the Olive Tree. These include [[Victory Altar]] and [[Shincheonji Church of Jesus the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony|Shincheonji]], founded in 1981 and 1984 respectively. Their theologies have been influenced by Park.<ref name=\"Kim\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:New religious movements]]\n[[Category:Religious organizations based in South Korea]]\n[[Category:Self-declared messiahs]]\n", "name_user": "Chad The Goatman", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_Tree_(religious_movement)"}

The 1972 constitution saw the establishment of the post of [[President of North Korea]] which led the executive branch, and the cabinet was split into two organizations: The Central People's Committee and the State Administration Council. The Central People's Committee provided the highest visible institutional link between the government and the party and serves in effect as a de facto super-cabinet. The [[National Defence Commission]] was then sub-committee of this body.<ref>Article 105 of the 1972 Constitution</ref> The CPC's formal powers were all-inclusive and it was chaired by the President.<ref>Articles 100-106 of the 1972 Constitution of North Korea</ref> Among its responsibilities are formulating domestic and foreign policies, directing the work of the State Administration Council and its local organs, directing the judiciary, ensuring the enforcement of the constitution and other laws, appointing or removing the vice premiers and cabinet members, establishing or changing administrative subdivisions or their boundaries, and ratifying or abolishing treaties signed with foreign countries. The CPC also may issue decrees, decisions, and instructions. The State Administration Council was guided by the CPC and was led by a premier (chong-ri) and included vice premiers (bochong-ri), ministers (boojang), committee chairmen, and other cabinet-level members of central agencies. It was responsible for the formulation of state economic development plans and measures for implementing them, the preparation of the state budget, and the handling of other monetary and fiscal matters.<ref>A Country Study: North Korea- 1993- Library of Congress</ref>\n\n1982 saw the [[Ministry of People's Armed Forces|People's Armed Forces]] and [[Ministry of People's Security (North Korea)|Public Security Ministries]] assigned directly to the President together with the State Inspection Commission.\n\nIn 1990, by a CPC decision, the NDC became fully independent from it as a separate institution, and 1992 constitutional amendments assigned it directly to the [[Supreme People's Assembly]]. In 1998 amendments to the Constitution, the Central People's Committee and the State Administration were abolished, and the Cabinet was re-created. Thus, the Cabinet is not only the highest executive enforcement organ but was also expanded to become the general State management organ.\n\nEmphasizing its expanded role, on January 1999 Kim Jong-il stated that {{quote|\"The party organizations and party cadres should not intervene in administrative matters.

and [[executive body]] and a general state-management organ in the [[Government of North Korea]].<ref>Article 123 of the Constitution of North Korea</ref> The Cabinet's principal newspaper is ''[[Minju Choson]]''.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Park Hon-youn and Ather 1949.jpg|thumb|The cabinet, headed by [[Kim Il-sung]], visiting [[Moscow]] in 1949]]\nIn North Korea's first constitution, adopted in 1948, the executive powers were vested in the Cabinet, chaired by [[Kim Il-sung]] himself. The 1972 constitution saw the establishment of the post of [[President of North Korea]] which led the executive branch, and the cabinet was split into two organizations: The Central People's Committee and the State Administration Council. The Central People's Committee provided the highest visible institutional link between the government and the party and serves in effect as a de facto super-cabinet. The [[National Defence Commission]] was then sub-committee of this body.<ref>Article 105 of the 1972 Constitution</ref> The CPC's formal powers were all-inclusive and it was chaired by the President.<ref>Articles 100-106 of the 1972 Constitution of North Korea</ref> Among its responsibilities are formulating domestic and foreign policies, directing the work of the State Administration Council and its local organs, directing the judiciary, ensuring the enforcement of the constitution and other laws, appointing or removing the vice premiers and cabinet members, establishing or changing administrative subdivisions or their boundaries, and ratifying or abolishing treaties signed with foreign countries. The CPC also may issue decrees, decisions, and instructions. The State Administration Council was guided by the CPC and was led by a premier (chong-ri) and included vice premiers (bochong-ri), ministers (boojang), committee chairmen, and other cabinet-level members of central agencies. It was responsible for the formulation of state economic development plans and measures for implementing them, the preparation of the state budget, and the handling of other monetary and fiscal matters.<ref>A Country Study: North Korea- 1993- Library of Congress</ref>\n\n1982 saw the [[Ministry of People's Armed Forces|People's Armed Forces]] and [[Ministry of People's Security (North Korea)|Public Security Ministries]] assigned directly to the President together with the State Inspection Commission.\n\nIn 1990, by a CPC decision, the NDC became fully independent from it as a separate institution, and 1992 constitutional amendments assigned it directly to the [[Supreme People's Assembly]]. In 1998 amendments to the Constitution, the Central People's Committee and the State Administration were abolished, and the Cabinet was re-created. Thus, the Cabinet is not only the highest executive enforcement organ but was also expanded to become the general State management organ.\n\nEmphasizing its expanded role, on January 1999 Kim Jong-il stated that {{quote|\"The party organizations and party cadres should not intervene in administrative matters. The party should help the cabinet to be responsible for all economic affairs. Last year we made a new governmental system where the cabinet is supposed to be the control tower of the economy...No organizational unit should handle economic problems without consulting the cabinet\".<ref> Jae-Cheon Lim.

The cabinet is not responsible for defense and security issues, as those are handled by the [[State Affairs Commission of North Korea|State Affairs Commission]]. Thus, the security organizations such as the [[Korean People's Army]], [[Ministry of People's Security (North Korea)|Ministry of People's Security]] and [[State Security Department]] report and subordinated directly to the SAC, whose Chairman holds full power as the supreme leader of the republic and the party and overall commander-in-chief of all uniformed forces. The Cabinet convenes a plenary meeting and an executive meeting.<ref>Article 121 of the Constitution of North Korea</ref> The plenary meeting consists of all the Cabinet members, while the executive meeting  is kind of a [[presidium]], and comprises fewer people, including the Premier, vice premier and other Cabinet members whom the Premier nominates. The cabinet forms [[Act (document)#Legislative Acts|acts]] in the form of decisions and directives.

Arched caption reads \"An Clai\u1e0bea\u1e41 Soluis\"]]\n\n'''The Sword of Light''' ({{lang-ga|Cla\u00edomh Solais}}, '''Claidheamh Soluis''' ({{IPA-ga|kl\u02e0i\u02d0v\u02e0 \u02c8s\u02e0\u0254l\u032a\u02e0\u0259\u0283}}; {{lang-sga|claidheamh soluis}}) is a [[Trope (literature)|trope]] object that appears in a number of Irish and Scottish Gaelic folktales. The  \"Quest for sword of light\" formula is catalogued as [[Motif-Index of Folk-Literature|motif]] H1337.\n\nThe sword appears commonly as a quest object in the Irish folktale of a hero seeking \"The One Story\" (or the \"Cause of the one story about women\"), which culiminates in the discovery of a \"Tale of the Werewolf\" (a man magically turned wolf by an unfaithful wife). However, the sword is uninvolved in the man-wolf portion, and only figures in the hero-adventure [[frame story]].\n\nThe sword of light,  according to a different commentator, is a fixture of an Irish tale group describable as a quasi-bridal-quest. This characterization is inspired by the formula where the hero gains a beautiful wife (and riches) by gambling against a [[gruagach]] or wizard, but then suffers loses making him beholden to mount a hopeless-seeming quest. Like the actual \"giant's daughter\" bridal quest tales, the sword of light hero often gains the assistance of \"helpful animals\" help him complete his tasks or ordeals.\n\nThe sword has been regarded as a legacy to the god-slaying weapons of [[Irish mythology]] by certain scholars, such as [[T. F. O'Rahilly]], the analogues being the primeval Celtic deity's lightning-weapon, [[Lugh]]'s sling that felled [[Balor]], the hero [[C\u00fachulainn]]'s supernatural spear [[Gae bulga]] and his shining sword Cruaid\u00edn Catutchenn.\n\n==Forms==\n\nThe spelling as appears in published Irish text and scholastic commentary is ''Claidheamh Soluis''<ref name=oceochain/> alternatively '''''(an) cloidheamh solais''''';<ref>{{harvp|O'Rahilly|1946}}, EIHM, p. 68; {{harvp|Kennedy|1866|pp=261ff}}.</ref> but these are pre-reform spelling, and in modernized [[Irish orthography#Spelling reform|reformed spelling]] ''Cla\u00edomh Solais'' would be used.<ref name=mackillop-claidheamh_soluis/> The name has also been transliterated into [[Hiberno-English]] as '''chloive solais'''.{{sfnp|Kennedy|1866|p=270}} The sword may be rendered in English as the \"Sword of Light\", or \"'''Shining Sword'''\".<ref name=puhvel-note27>{{harvp|Puhvel|1972|loc=p. 214, n27}}</ref>\n\nLikewise, the [[Scottish Gaelic]] form is {{lang|gd|claidheamh soluis}} \"glaive of light\", <ref name=campbell-easaidh-ruadh/> or {{lang|gd|claidheamh geal soluis }} \"White Glave of Light\".<ref>{{harvp|Campbell|1860|loc='''I''': lxxvii}}</ref><ref name=puhvel-note27/>{{Refn|group=\"lower-alpha\"|While [[glaive]] can denote a broadsword, though it may often refer to a polearm<ref name=oxford-dict-glaive/>.}}\n\n== Overview ==\nThe folk tales featuring the sword of light may be bridal quests, and the hero's would-be bride often becomes the hero's helper.<ref name=curtin1890-thirteenth-son/><ref name=campbell-widows-son/>{{Refn|group=\"lower-alpha\"|Or involve the winning of husbands in e.g., Maol a Chliobain.<ref name=campbell-maol/>}}\n\nBut more typically the story is a sort of quasi-bridal quest,{{efn|Joseph Baudi\u0161 remarks the tale group is similar to the \"''quest for the bride''\".}}<ref name=baudis-sword-of-light/> where the hero wins a bride by wager, but then suffers a loss, becoming oath-bound (compelled by ''[[geis]]''{{Refn|group=\"lower-alpha\"|By laying a [[geas]] or geasa  (taboo), e.g., Kennedy's version,<ref>{{harvp|Kennedy|1866|p=260}}: \"I lay geasa on you\".</ref> \u00d3 Cill\u00edn ed. <ref>{{harvp|\u00d3 Cill\u00edn|1933|p=163}}: \"The prince fulfils his obligations (geasa)\".</ref> Cf.

F. O'Rahilly]]'s schema, roughly speaking, the primeval divine weapon was a fiery and bright lightning weapon, most often conceived of as a throwing spear; in later traditions, the wielder would change from god to hero, and spear tended to be replaced by sword. From the heroic cycles, some prominent examples are [[Fergus Mac Roigh]]'s sword [[Caladbolg]] and Mac Cecht's spear. But Caladbolg does not manifest as a blazing sword, and the latter which does emit fiery sparks is a spear, thus failing to fit the profile of a sword which shines. One example which does fit, is C\u00fachulainn's sword Cruaid\u00edn Catutchenn which was aforementioned.<ref>{{harvp|O'Rahilly|1946}}(EIHM)</ref> And the legacy of these mythological and heroic weapons (Lug's lighting-weapon, his \"son\" C\u00fachulainn's remarkable sword, etc. ) survive in the \"sword of light\" in folklore.{{sfnp|Puhvel|1972|pp=210, 214\u2013215}}<ref name=gm/>\n\n=== Connection to Arthuriana ===\n\nA broad sweeping parallel has been made between the light or lightning weapons of Celtic tradition and King Arthur's [[Excalibur]], described as brightly shining in several places of the [[Vulgate cycle]] ''Roman de Merlin''.{{sfnp|Puhvel|1972|p=214}}{{efn|Citing ''Roman de Merlin'', ed.

In the ''[[Huth Merlin]]'', [[Morgan le Fay]] plots to have Arthur killed with his own Excalibur, by stealing the sword for her lover Accalon, who unbeknownst fights his lord King Arthur with it. The [[Lady of the Lake]] intercedes at the right moment to prevent Arthur's death.{{sfn|Puhvel|1972|pp=214\u2013215}} The episode has been copied by Malory as well{{sfn|Puhvel|1972|pp=214\u2013215}} (with the knight being called Accolon unlike the French original)<ref>Malory, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=kpsdpva9Q-8C&pg=PA80 Le Morte D'Arthur]'', Book IV, Chapters 8-30.

The  \"Quest for sword of light\" formula is catalogued as [[Motif-Index of Folk-Literature|motif]] H1337.\n\nThe sword appears commonly as a quest object in the Irish folktale of a hero seeking \"The One Story\" (or the \"Cause of the one story about women\"), which culiminates in the discovery of a \"Tale of the Werewolf\" (a man magically turned wolf by an unfaithful wife). However, the sword is uninvolved in the man-wolf portion, and only figures in the hero-adventure [[frame story]].\n\nThe sword of light,  according to a different commentator, is a fixture of an Irish tale group describable as a quasi-bridal-quest. This characterization is inspired by the formula where the hero gains a beautiful wife (and riches) by gambling against a [[gruagach]] or wizard, but then suffers loses making him beholden to mount a hopeless-seeming quest. Like the actual \"giant's daughter\" bridal quest tales, the sword of light hero often gains the assistance of \"helpful animals\" help him complete his tasks or ordeals.\n\nThe sword has been regarded as a legacy to the god-slaying weapons of [[Irish mythology]] by certain scholars, such as [[T. F. O'Rahilly]], the analogues being the primeval Celtic deity's lightning-weapon, [[Lugh]]'s sling that felled [[Balor]], the hero [[C\u00fachulainn]]'s supernatural spear [[Gae bulga]] and his shining sword Cruaid\u00edn Catutchenn.\n\n==Forms==\n\nThe spelling as appears in published Irish text and scholastic commentary is ''Claidheamh Soluis''<ref name=oceochain/> alternatively '''''(an) cloidheamh solais''''';<ref>{{harvp|O'Rahilly|1946}}, EIHM, p. 68; {{harvp|Kennedy|1866|pp=261ff}}.</ref> but these are pre-reform spelling, and in modernized [[Irish orthography#Spelling reform|reformed spelling]] ''Cla\u00edomh Solais'' would be used.<ref name=mackillop-claidheamh_soluis/> The name has also been transliterated into [[Hiberno-English]] as '''chloive solais'''.{{sfnp|Kennedy|1866|p=270}} The sword may be rendered in English as the \"Sword of Light\", or \"'''Shining Sword'''\".<ref name=puhvel-note27>{{harvp|Puhvel|1972|loc=p. 214, n27}}</ref>\n\nLikewise, the [[Scottish Gaelic]] form is {{lang|gd|claidheamh soluis}} \"glaive of light\", <ref name=campbell-easaidh-ruadh/> or {{lang|gd|claidheamh geal soluis }} \"White Glave of Light\".<ref>{{harvp|Campbell|1860|loc='''I''': lxxvii}}</ref><ref name=puhvel-note27/>{{Refn|group=\"lower-alpha\"|While [[glaive]] can denote a broadsword, though it may often refer to a polearm<ref name=oxford-dict-glaive/>.}}\n\n== Overview ==\nThe folk tales featuring the sword of light may be bridal quests, and the hero's would-be bride often becomes the hero's helper.<ref name=curtin1890-thirteenth-son/><ref name=campbell-widows-son/>{{Refn|group=\"lower-alpha\"|Or involve the winning of husbands in e.g., Maol a Chliobain.<ref name=campbell-maol/>}}\n\nBut more typically the story is a sort of quasi-bridal quest,{{efn|Joseph Baudi\u0161 remarks the tale group is similar to the \"''quest for the bride''\".}}<ref name=baudis-sword-of-light/> where the hero wins a bride by wager, but then suffers a loss, becoming oath-bound (compelled by ''[[geis]]''{{Refn|group=\"lower-alpha\"|By laying a [[geas]] or geasa  (taboo), e.g., Kennedy's version,<ref>{{harvp|Kennedy|1866|p=260}}: \"I lay geasa on you\".</ref> \u00d3 Cill\u00edn ed. <ref>{{harvp|\u00d3 Cill\u00edn|1933|p=163}}: \"The prince fulfils his obligations (geasa)\".</ref> Cf.

F. O'Rahilly]]'s schema, roughly speaking, the primeval divine weapon was a fiery and bright lightning weapon, most often conceived of as a throwing spear; in later traditions, the wielder would change from god to hero, and spear tended to be replaced by sword. From the heroic cycles, some prominent examples are [[Fergus Mac Roigh]]'s sword [[Caladbolg]] and Mac Cecht's spear. But Caladbolg does not manifest as a blazing sword, and the latter which does emit fiery sparks is a spear, thus failing to fit the profile of a sword which shines. One example which does fit, is C\u00fachulainn's sword Cruaid\u00edn Catutchenn which was aforementioned.<ref>{{harvp|O'Rahilly|1946}}(EIHM)</ref> And the legacy of these mythological and heroic weapons (Lug's lighting-weapon, his \"son\" C\u00fachulainn's remarkable sword, etc. ) survive in the \"sword of light\" in folklore.{{sfnp|Puhvel|1972|pp=210, 214\u2013215}}<ref name=gm/>\n\n=== Connection to Arthuriana ===\n\nA broad sweeping parallel has been made between the light or lightning weapons of Celtic tradition and King Arthur's [[Excalibur]], described as brightly shining in several places of the [[Vulgate cycle]] ''Roman de Merlin''.{{sfnp|Puhvel|1972|p=214}}{{efn|Citing ''Roman de Merlin'', ed.

In the ''[[Huth Merlin]]'', [[Morgan le Fay]] plots to have Arthur killed with his own Excalibur, by stealing the sword for her lover Accalon, who unbeknownst fights his lord King Arthur with it. The [[Lady of the Lake]] intercedes at the right moment to prevent Arthur's death.{{sfn|Puhvel|1972|pp=214\u2013215}} The episode has been copied by Malory as well{{sfn|Puhvel|1972|pp=214\u2013215}} (with the knight being called Accolon unlike the French original)<ref>Malory, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=kpsdpva9Q-8C&pg=PA80 Le Morte D'Arthur]'', Book IV, Chapters 8-30.
