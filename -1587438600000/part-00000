The two primary goals of Ichi-go were to open a land route to [[French Indochina]], and capture air bases in southeast China from which American bombers were attacking the Japanese homeland and shipping.<ref>''The U.S. Army Campaigns of World War II: China Defensive'', pg. 21</ref>\n\nIn [[Japanese language|Japanese]] the operation was also called '''''Tairiku Dats\u016b Sakusen''''' (\u5927\u9678\u6253\u901a\u4f5c\u6226), or \"Continent Cross-Through Operation\", while the Chinese refer to it as the '''Battle of Henan-Hunan-Guangxi''' ({{zh|t=\u8c6b\u6e58\u6842\u6703\u6230|s=\u8c6b\u6e58\u6842\u4f1a\u6218|p=Y\u00f9 X\u012bang Gu\u00ec Hu\u00eczh\u00e0n}}).\n\n==Campaign==\n[[File:Japanese mechanized forces marching towards Lo-yang.jpg|thumb|left|1944 Operation Ichigo]]\nThere were two phases to the operation. In the first phase, the Japanese secured the [[Beijing\u2013Hankou Railway|Pinghan Railway]] between [[Beijing]] and Wuhan; in the second, they displaced the US air forces stationed in Hunan province and reached the city of [[Liuzhou]], near the border with Japanese-held [[Indochina]]. 17 divisions, including 500,000 men, 15,000 vehicles, 6,000 artillery pieces, 800 tanks and 100,000 horses participated in this operation.\n\nThe Japanese included [[Kwantung Army]] units and equipment from [[Manchukuo]], mechanized units, units from the North China theater and units from mainland Japan to participate in this campaign. It was the largest land campaign organized by the Japanese during the entire [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. Many of the newest American-trained Chinese units and supplies were forcibly locked in the Burmese theater under [[Joseph Stilwell]] set by terms of the Lend-Lease Agreement.\n[[File:1944 Operation Ichigo IJA invaded Henan.jpg|thumb|left|Operation Ichigo, IJA invading Henan, 1944]]\nIn [[Battle of Central Henan|Operation Kogo]], 390,000 Chinese soldiers, led by General [[Tang Enbo]] (\u6e6f\u6069\u4f2f), were deployed to defend the strategic position of [[Luoyang]]. <!-- What does \"strategic position\" mean here? Please clarify.--> The 3rd Tank Division of the IJA crossed the [[Yellow River]] around [[Zhengzhou]] in late April and defeated Chinese forces near [[Xuchang]], then swung around clockwise and besieged Luoyang. Luoyang was defended by three Chinese divisions. The 3rd Tank Division began to attack Luoyang on May 13 and took it on May 25.\n[[File:Situation at the End of World War Two.PNG|thumb|left|Japanese occupation (red) of eastern China near the end of the war, and Communist guerrilla bases (striped)]]\nThe second phase of Ichigo began in May, following the success of the first phase. Japanese forces advanced southward and occupied [[Changsha]], [[Hengyang]], [[Guilin]] and [[Liuzhou]]. In December 1944, Japanese forces reached French Indochina and achieved the purpose of the operation. Nevertheless, there were few practical gains from this offensive. US air forces moved inland from the threatened bases near the coast. The operation also forced British Commandos working with the Chinese as part of [[Mission 204]] to leave China and return to Burma. The U.S. [[Fourteenth Air Force]] often disrupted the [[Hunan\u2013Guangxi Railway]] between Hengyang and Liuzhou that had been established in Operation Ichigo. Japan continued to attack airfields where US air forces were stationed up to the spring of 1945.\n\nThe [[XX Bomber Command]] operating Strategic [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29 bombers]] of the [[Twentieth Air Force]], which were attacking Japan in [[Operation Matterhorn]], were forced to move as well, but although this affected their efficiency for a short time, in early 1945 the Twentieth Air Force moved to newly established bases in the [[Marianas]] under the command of the newly established [[XXI Bomber Command]]. This nullified the limited protection that the Japanese home islands had received from Operation Ichigo.\n\n===Henan peasants attack Kuomintang forces===\nGeneral [[Jiang Dingwen]] of the First War Zone gave his account of the behavior of Henan civilians: \"During the campaign, the unexpected phenomenon was that the people of the mountains in western Henan attacked our troops, taking guns, bullets, and explosives, and even high-powered mortars and radio equipment... They surrounded our troops and killed our officers. We heard this pretty often. The heads of the villages and baojia (village mutual-responsibility groups) just ran away.

He was able to convince General [[George Marshall]] to have President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] send an ultimatum to [[Chiang Kai-shek]] threatening to end all American aid unless Chiang \"at once\" placed Stilwell \"in unrestricted command of all your forces.\"<ref>Romanus and Sunderland, Stilwell's Command Problem, p.446\u2013447</ref>\n\nAn exultant Stilwell immediately delivered this letter to Chiang despite pleas from [[Patrick Hurley]], Roosevelt's special envoy in China, to delay delivering the message and work on a deal that would achieve Stilwell's aim in a manner more acceptable to Chiang.<ref>Lohbeck, Hurley, p.292</ref> Seeing this act as a move toward the complete subjugation and vassalization of China, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] gave a formal reply in which he said that Stilwell must be replaced immediately.<ref>Lohbeck, Hurley, p.298</ref><ref>Romanus and Sunderland, Stilwell's Command Problem, p.452</ref>\nAs a result, Stilwell was replaced as Chief of Staff to Chiang Kai-shek and commander of the U.S. Forces, China Theater (USFCT) by Major General [[Albert Wedemeyer]]. Stilwell's other command responsibilities in the [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|China Burma India Theater]] were divided up and allocated to other officers.\n\nAlthough Chiang was successful in removing Stilwell, the public relations damage suffered by his Chinese Nationalist Party ([[Kuomintang]]) regime was irreparable. Right before Stilwell's departure, [[The New York Times|''New York Times'']] drama critic-turned-war correspondent [[Brooks Atkinson]] interviewed him in [[Chungking]] and wrote:<blockquote>The decision to relieve General Stilwell represents the political triumph of a moribund, anti-democratic regime that is more concerned with maintaining its political supremacy than in driving the Japanese out of China.  The Chinese Communists... have good armies that they are claiming to be fighting guerrilla warfare against the Japanese in North China\u2014actually they are covertly or even overtly building themselves up to fight Generalissimo's government forces... The Generalissimo [Chiang Kai-shek] naturally regards these armies as the chief threat to the country and his supremacy... has seen no need to make sincere attempt to arrange at least a truce with them for the duration of the war...

This view was shared by many U.S. journalists in China at the time, but due to pro-Chiang Allied press censorship, it was not as well known to their readers until Stilwell's recall and the ensuing anti-Chiang coverage forced it into the open.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|author1=Knightley, Phillip\n|title=The First Casualty: The War Correspondent as Hero and Myth-Maker from the Crimea to Iraq\n|page=303\n|date=2004\n|edition=3rd\n|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]]\n|isbn=978-0-8018-8030-8\n|author1-link=Phillip Knightley\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe Japanese successes in Operation Ichi-Go had a limited effect on the war. The U.S. could still bomb the Japanese homeland from [[Saipan]] and other Pacific bases. In the territories seized, Japanese forces controlled only the cities, not their surrounding countryside. The increased size of the occupied territory also thinned out the Japanese lines. A great majority of the Chinese forces were able to retreat out of the area, and later come back to attack Japanese positions. As a result, future Japanese attempts to fight into [[Sichuan]], such as in the [[Battle of West Hunan]], ended in failure. All in all, Japan was not any closer in defeating China after this operation, and the constant defeats the Japanese suffered in the Pacific meant that Japan never got the time and resources needed to achieve final victory over China. The Japanese suffered 11,742 KIAs by mid-November, and the number of soldiers that died of illness was more than twice this.<ref>http://d.hatena.ne.jp/Apeman/20070710/p1</ref><ref>Until mid-November, IJA had a illness toll of 66,000\uff0cand a field hospital had taken in 6164 soldiers, 2,281 of which died due to malnutrition \u9913\u6b7b\u3057\u305f\u82f1\u970a\u305f\u3061 P116</ref><ref>[http://mil.huanqiu.com/history/2013-06/4001059.html In 1944, twice as many Japanese soldiers died of illness as KIA]</ref> The total death toll was about 100,000 by the end of 1944.<ref name=\"\u4e2d\u56fd\u6170\u970a\"/>\n\nOperation Ichi-go created a great sense of social confusion in the areas of China that it affected. Chinese Communist guerrillas were able to exploit this confusion to gain influence and control of greater areas of the countryside in the aftermath of Ichi-go.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=R7qNuIJJsNEC&pg=PA162&lpg ''China at War: An Encyclopedia''].

White|Theodore White]], a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine correspondent in China at the time of the offensive, was based on an interview with former [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] Major Frank Gleason, who led a demolition group of American soldiers during the offensive that were charged with blowing up anything left behind in the retreat that might be of use to Japan. His group ultimately destroyed over 150 bridges and 50,000 tons of munitions, helping slow the Japanese advance. In 1960, it was [[The Mountain Road|adapted into a film]] starring [[James Stewart]] and [[Lisa Lu]], noteworthy for being one of Stewart's only war films and the only one where he plays a soldier, as he was opposed to war films due to their inaccuracy. It is generally believed he made an exception for this film because it was anti-war.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* Mitter, Rana, ''China's War with Japan, 1937-1945: The Struggle for Survival'', Penguin Books (2014), {{ISBN|978-0-141-03145-3}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book| url = http://www.history.army.mil/brochures/72-38/72-38.HTM | series = The U.S. Army Campaigns of World War II| title=  China Defensive| publisher = [[United States Army Center of Military History]]| id = CMH Pub 72-38| first = Mark D. | last = Sherry}}\n\n{{coord missing|China}}\n{{World War II}}\n\n[[Category:Battles of the Second Sino-Japanese War|Henan-Hunan-Guangxi 1944]]\n[[Category:1944 in China]]\n[[Category:1944 in Japan]]\n[[Category:History of Henan]]\n[[Category:History of Hunan]]\n[[Category:History of Guangxi]]\n", "text_old": "{{Expand German|date=February 2018}}\n{{Infobox military conflict\n| conflict    = Operation Ichi-Go\n| partof      = the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], [[World War II]]\n| image       = Ichigo plan.jpg\n| image_size  = 300px\n| caption     = Japanese plan for Operation Ichi-Go\n| date        = 19 April \u2013 31 December 1944<ref>Davison, John ''The Pacific War: Day By Day'', pg. 37, 106</ref>\n| place       = [[Henan]], [[Hunan]] and [[Guangxi]]\n| result      = Japanese victory\n| combatant1  = {{flagcountry|Empire of Japan}}\n| combatant2  = {{flagcountry|Republic of China (1912\u20131949)}}<br /> {{flag|United States|1912}}\n| commander1  = {{flagicon|Empire of Japan|army}} [[Shunroku Hata]]<br/> {{flagicon|Empire of Japan|army}} [[Yasuji Okamura]]<br/> {{flagicon|Empire of Japan|army}} [[Isamu Yokoyama]]\n| commander2  = {{flagicon|Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|army}} [[Tang Enbo]]<br/> {{flagicon|Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|army}} [[Xue Yue]]<br/> {{flagicon|Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|army}} [[Bai Chongxi]]<br/> {{flagicon|USA|1912}} [[Joseph Stilwell]]\n| strength1   = 500,000<br> 15,000 vehicles<br> 6,000 artillery pieces<ref>http://memim.com/operation-ichi-go.html</ref><br> 800 tanks<br> 100,000 horses<ref>Hastings, Retribution pg. 210</ref>\n| strength2   = 2,500,000<ref>Hsiung, China's Bitter Victory pg. 165</ref>\n| casualties1 = ~100,000 deaths<ref name=\"\u4e2d\u56fd\u6170\u970a\">[https://books.google.com/books?hl=zh-CN&id=u2AzAQAAIAAJ&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=+%E6%88%A6%E6%AD%BB+%E6%88%A6%E7%97%85%E6%AD%BB] \u8a18\u8005\u304c\u8a9e\u308a\u3064\u3050\u6226\u4e89 16 \u4e2d\u56fd\u6170\u970a \u8aad\u58f2\u65b0\u805e\u793e (1983/2) P187</ref><br> heavy [[materiel]] losses<ref>[http://memim.com/operation-ichi-go.html \"Operation Ichi-Go\"] Retrieved 16 Nov. 2015</ref>\n| casualties2 = 700,000 wounded, dead or missing<ref name=\"Cox, 1980 pp. 2\">[http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a272727.pdf Cox, 1980 pp. 2] Retrieved 9 March 2016</ref><ref name=\"Sandler, Stanley p. 431\">Sandler, Stanley. \"World War II in the Pacific: an Encyclopedia\" p. 431</ref>\n| casualties4 = 500,000+ Chinese civilians<ref>Pike, Francis.

This view was shared by many U.S. journalists in China at the time, but due to pro-Chiang Allied press censorship, it was not as well known to their readers until Stilwell's recall and the ensuing anti-Chiang coverage forced it into the open.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|author1=Knightley, Phillip\n|title=The First Casualty: The War Correspondent as Hero and Myth-Maker from the Crimea to Iraq\n|page=303\n|date=2004\n|edition=3rd\n|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]]\n|isbn=978-0-8018-8030-8\n|author1-link=Phillip Knightley\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe Japanese successes in Operation Ichi-Go had a limited effect on the war. The U.S. could still bomb the Japanese homeland from [[Saipan]] and other Pacific bases. In the territories seized, Japanese forces controlled only the cities, not their surrounding countryside. The increased size of the occupied territory also thinned out the Japanese lines. A great majority of the Chinese forces were able to retreat out of the area, and later come back to attack Japanese positions. As a result, future Japanese attempts to fight into [[Sichuan]], such as in the [[Battle of West Hunan]], ended in failure. All in all, Japan was not any closer in defeating China after this operation, and the constant defeats the Japanese suffered in the Pacific meant that Japan never got the time and resources needed to achieve final victory over China. The Japanese suffered 11,742 KIAs by mid-November, and the number of soldiers that died of illness was more than twice this.<ref>http://d.hatena.ne.jp/Apeman/20070710/p1</ref><ref>Until mid-November, IJA had a illness toll of 66,000\uff0cand a field hospital had taken in 6164 soldiers, 2,281 of which died due to malnutrition \u9913\u6b7b\u3057\u305f\u82f1\u970a\u305f\u3061 P116</ref><ref>[http://mil.huanqiu.com/history/2013-06/4001059.html In 1944, twice as many Japanese soldiers died of illness as KIA]</ref> The total death toll was about 100,000 by the end of 1944.<ref name=\"\u4e2d\u56fd\u6170\u970a\"/>\n\nOperation Ichi-go created a great sense of social confusion in the areas of China that it affected. Chinese Communist guerrillas were able to exploit this confusion to gain influence and control of greater areas of the countryside in the aftermath of Ichi-go.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=R7qNuIJJsNEC&pg=PA162&lpg ''China at War: An Encyclopedia''].

White|Theodore White]], a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine correspondent in China at the time of the offensive, was based on an interview with former [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] Major Frank Gleason, who led a demolition group of American soldiers during the offensive that were charged with blowing up anything left behind in the retreat that might be of use to Japan. His group ultimately destroyed over 150 bridges and 50,000 tons of munitions, helping slow the Japanese advance. In 1960, it was [[The Mountain Road|adapted into a film]] starring [[James Stewart]] and [[Lisa Lu]], noteworthy for being one of Stewart's only war films and the only one where he plays a soldier, as he was opposed to war films due to their inaccuracy. It is generally believed he made an exception for this film because it was anti-war.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* Mitter, Rana, ''China's War with Japan, 1937-1945: The Struggle for Survival'', Penguin Books (2014), {{ISBN|978-0-141-03145-3}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book| url = http://www.history.army.mil/brochures/72-38/72-38.HTM | series = The U.S. Army Campaigns of World War II| title=  China Defensive| publisher = [[United States Army Center of Military History]]| id = CMH Pub 72-38| first = Mark D. | last = Sherry}}\n\n{{coord missing|China}}\n{{World War II}}\n\n[[Category:Battles of the Second Sino-Japanese War|Henan-Hunan-Guangxi 1944]]\n[[Category:1944 in China]]\n[[Category:1944 in Japan]]\n[[Category:History of Henan]]\n[[Category:History of Hunan]]\n[[Category:History of Guangxi]]\n", "name_user": "111.65.45.228", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Ichi-Go"}

The preferred horses were normally laden with high priced [[Saddle|saddles]], blankets, bridles and saddlebags. These pieces of equipment increased trading opportunity and provided tribes with the necessary equipment each household needed. Horses were obtained through trading, raids, and war<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Aberle|first=David F.|last2=Clark|first2=Laverne Harrell|date=1967|title=They Sang for Horses: The Impact of the Horse on Navajo and Apache Folklore.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2799533|journal=Man|volume=2|issue=2|pages=323|doi=10.2307/2799533|issn=0025-1496|via=}}</ref>. Each time a tribe successfully raided another tribe and increased their herd, they became more powerful.\n\n== Separation of tribes caused by horses ==\nThe introduction of the horse revolutionized life for Native Americans. However, the distribution of horses was not equal and this complicated life for tribes who had less access to horses. Due to differences in climates and the difficulties associated with caring for horses throughout the winter; horses were not as abundant in the north. [[Plains tribes]] were not part of a single freely interacting group. Consequently, two subsets formed between tribes<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Carson|first=James Taylor|date=1995|title=Horses and the Economy and Culture of the Choctaw Indians, 1690-1840|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/483216|journal=Ethnohistory|volume=42|issue=3|pages=495|doi=10.2307/483216|issn=0014-1801}}</ref>. The southern tribes had increased access to horses because Spanish settlers brought herds from Mexico. This created a social division between tribes, the more horses a tribe had the more powerful it became. Tribes such as the [[Comanche]] and [[Cheyenne]] who had many horses, were able to push tribes like the [[Apache]], [[Wichita]], and [[Tonkawa]] off of plains territory<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jacobsen|first=R.

[[Ecology]] also played a role in the distribution of the horse. Water is the most crucial variable in horse ownership. Because horses require so much more water than humans, they had to move around to various water sources. Native American tribes had to be constantly aware of proximity to water sources. Tribes also had to be aware of surrounding shade, fuel, forage, shelter, and supplemental foods for horses.

The thing that made the Ute group so special is how they were able to not only acquire the horse, but to master the horse. Mastering the horse is not an easy task. Because the Utes were able to do so this made them one of the most dominant and most respected tribes. The horse became a huge symbol of wealth and pride to the Utes. This meant that the more horses that one attained, the more powerful, wealthy, and full of pride they were. Utes were one of the most feared groups in battle because of their tactics and mastery of the horse<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://coloradoencyclopedia.org/article/ute-history-and-ute-mountain-ute-tribe|title=Ute History and the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe|last=yongli|date=2016-05-09|website=coloradoencyclopedia.org|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>. Because of special stirrups that Utes had developed and used on their horses, they were able to fight in many different ways. They could slide underneath the horse with ease and maneuver in many different ways giving them the advantage in battle. They were able to attack and shoot from underneath the horse as the horse continued running. Because of these tactics and the mastery of the horse by the Utes, they were able to be very successful in the 17th century into the early 18th century. \n\nThe horse introduced incredible advantages for the Ute Indians. As the Utes mastered the horses they were masters at managing their herds, and continually growing their herds. Because of the number of horses obtained they were able to travel further distances than ever before. Moving their whole tribe as needed, they did not have to leave anyone behind as they could move as they pleased with the horse. They expanded their territory traveling as far east as the panhandles of [[Texas]] and [[Oklahoma]]. Thanks to the horse, Utes were able to sustain their tribe through hard times. This was because horses were able to pack additional food and supplies needed to help their people make it through the brutal winter season. The horse made the Utes among the most feared tribes. In the 1700\u2019s the Utes joined with the Comanches and together these tribes with their horses dominated and carried out extensive raids against their neighboring tribes for following years.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n{{uncat|date=April 2020}}\n", "text_old": "Many advantages and benefits came to those who were able to obtain the [[horse]].

Each time a tribe successfully raided another tribe and increased their herd, they became more powerful.\n\n== Separation of tribes caused by horses ==\nThe introduction of the horse revolutionized life for Native Americans. However, the distribution of horses was not equal and this complicated life for tribes who had less access to horses. Due to differences in climates and the difficulties associated with caring for horses throughout the winter; horses were not as abundant in the north. [[Plains tribes]] were not part of a single freely interacting group. Consequently, two subsets formed between tribes<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Carson|first=James Taylor|date=1995|title=Horses and the Economy and Culture of the Choctaw Indians, 1690-1840|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/483216|journal=Ethnohistory|volume=42|issue=3|pages=495|doi=10.2307/483216|issn=0014-1801}}</ref>. The southern tribes had increased access to horses because Spanish conquerors brought herds from Mexico. This created a social divide between tribes, the more horses a tribe had the more powerful it became. Tribes such as the [[Comanche]] and [[Cheyenne]] who had many horses, were able to push tribes like the [[Apache]], [[Wichita]], and [[Tonkawa]] off of plains territory<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jacobsen|first=R.

[[Ecology]] also played a role in the distribution of the horse. Water is the most crucial variable in horse ownership. Because horses require so much more water than humans, they had to move around to various water sources. Native American tribes had to be constantly aware of proximity to water sources. Tribes also had to be aware of surrounding shade, fuel, forage, shelter, and supplemental foods for horses.

German Nationalism emphasizes and takes pride in the [[national identity]] of Germans. The earliest origins of German nationalism began with the birth of [[romantic nationalism]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] when [[Pan-Germanism]] started to rise. Advocacy of a German nation-state began to become an important political force in response to the invasion of German territories by France under [[Napoleon]].\n\nIn the 19th century Germans debated the [[German Question]] over whether the German nation state should comprise a \"[[Lesser Germany]]\" that excluded [[Austria]] or a \"Greater Germany\" that included Austria.{{sfn|Verheyen|1999|pp=8}} The faction led by [[Prussia]]n [[Chancellor]] [[Otto von Bismarck]] succeeded in forging a Lesser Germany.{{sfn|Verheyen|1999|pp=8}}\n\nAggressive German nationalism and territorial expansion was a key factor leading to both World Wars. Prior to [[World War I]], Germany had established a [[German colonial empire|colonial empire]] in hopes of rivaling Britain and France. In the 1930s, the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] came to power and sought to create a [[Greater Germanic Reich]], emphasizing ethnic German identity and German greatness to the exclusion of all others, eventually leading to the extermination of [[Jews]], [[Poles]], [[Romani people|Romani]], and other people deemed ''[[Untermensch]]en'' (subhumans) in [[the Holocaust]] during [[World War II]].\n\nAfter the defeat of [[Nazi Germany]], the country was divided into [[East Germany|East]] and [[West Germany]] in the opening acts of the [[Cold War]], and each state retained a sense of German identity and held reunification as a goal, albeit in different contexts. The creation of the [[European Union]] was in part an effort to harness German identity to a [[Pan-European identity|European identity]]. West Germany underwent its [[Wirtschaftswunder|economic miracle]] following the war, which led to the creation of a [[Gastarbeiter|guest worker program]]; many of these workers ended up settling in Germany which has led to tensions around questions of national and cultural identity, especially with regard to [[Turks in Germany|Turks who settled in Germany]].\n\n[[German reunification]] was achieved in 1990 following ''[[Die Wende]]''; an event that caused some alarm both inside and outside Germany. Germany has emerged as a power inside Europe and in the world; its role in the [[European debt crisis]] and in the [[European migrant crisis]] have led to criticism of German authoritarian abuse of its power, especially with regard to the [[Greek government-debt crisis|Greek debt crisis]], and raised questions within and without Germany as to Germany's role in the world.\n\nDue to post-1945 repudiation of the Nazi regime and its atrocities, German nationalism has been generally viewed in the country as taboo{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=190}} and people within Germany have struggled to find ways to acknowledge its past but take pride in its past and present accomplishments; the German question has never been fully resolved in this regard. A wave of national pride swept the country when it hosted the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]. [[Far-right politics in Germany|Far-right]] parties that stress German national identity and pride have existed since the end of World War II but have never governed. \n\n Hitler encouraged [[World War 2]] to happen.\n\n==History==\n===Defining a German nation===\n[[File:Germania Te\u00fctschland at eRara.jpg|thumb|This map published in Z\u00fcrich in 1548 defines \"the German Nation\" based on its traditions, customs and language.<ref>\"[https://historiaymapas.wordpress.com/2018/10/18/nacionalismo-aleman-en-un-mapa-de-1548/ Nacionalismo alem\u00e1n en un mapa de 1548]\", in ''Historia y Mapas''</ref>]]\n\nDefining a German nation based on internal characteristics presented difficulties. Since the start of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in the 16th century, the German lands had been divided between [[Catholics]] and [[Lutherans]] and linguistic diversity was large as well.

German Nationalism emphasizes and takes pride in the [[national identity]] of Germans. The earliest origins of German nationalism began with the birth of [[romantic nationalism]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] when [[Pan-Germanism]] started to rise. Advocacy of a German nation-state began to become an important political force in response to the invasion of German territories by France under [[Napoleon]].\n\nIn the 19th century Germans debated the [[German Question]] over whether the German nation state should comprise a \"[[Lesser Germany]]\" that excluded [[Austria]] or a \"Greater Germany\" that included Austria.{{sfn|Verheyen|1999|pp=8}} The faction led by [[Prussia]]n [[Chancellor]] [[Otto von Bismarck]] succeeded in forging a Lesser Germany.{{sfn|Verheyen|1999|pp=8}}\n\nAggressive German nationalism and territorial expansion was a key factor leading to both World Wars. Prior to [[World War I]], Germany had established a [[German colonial empire|colonial empire]] in hopes of rivaling Britain and France. In the 1930s, the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] came to power and sought to create a [[Greater Germanic Reich]], emphasizing ethnic German identity and German greatness to the exclusion of all others, eventually leading to the extermination of [[Jews]], [[Poles]], [[Romani people|Romani]], and other people deemed ''[[Untermensch]]en'' (subhumans) in [[the Holocaust]] during [[World War II]].\n\nAfter the defeat of [[Nazi Germany]], the country was divided into [[East Germany|East]] and [[West Germany]] in the opening acts of the [[Cold War]], and each state retained a sense of German identity and held reunification as a goal, albeit in different contexts. The creation of the [[European Union]] was in part an effort to harness German identity to a [[Pan-European identity|European identity]]. West Germany underwent its [[Wirtschaftswunder|economic miracle]] following the war, which led to the creation of a [[Gastarbeiter|guest worker program]]; many of these workers ended up settling in Germany which has led to tensions around questions of national and cultural identity, especially with regard to [[Turks in Germany|Turks who settled in Germany]].\n\n[[German reunification]] was achieved in 1990 following ''[[Die Wende]]''; an event that caused some alarm both inside and outside Germany. Germany has emerged as a power inside Europe and in the world; its role in the [[European debt crisis]] and in the [[European migrant crisis]] have led to criticism of German authoritarian abuse of its power, especially with regard to the [[Greek government-debt crisis|Greek debt crisis]], and raised questions within and without Germany as to Germany's role in the world.\n\nDue to post-1945 repudiation of the Nazi regime and its atrocities, German nationalism has been generally viewed in the country as taboo{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=190}} and people within Germany have struggled to find ways to acknowledge its past but take pride in its past and present accomplishments; the German question has never been fully resolved in this regard. A wave of national pride swept the country when it hosted the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]. [[Far-right politics in Germany|Far-right]] parties that stress German national identity and pride have existed since the end of World War II but have never governed.\n\n==History==\n===Defining a German nation===\n[[File:Germania Te\u00fctschland at eRara.jpg|thumb|This map published in Z\u00fcrich in 1548 defines \"the German Nation\" based on its traditions, customs and language.<ref>\"[https://historiaymapas.wordpress.com/2018/10/18/nacionalismo-aleman-en-un-mapa-de-1548/ Nacionalismo alem\u00e1n en un mapa de 1548]\", in ''Historia y Mapas''</ref>]]\n\nDefining a German nation based on internal characteristics presented difficulties. Since the start of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in the 16th century, the German lands had been divided between [[Catholics]] and [[Lutherans]] and linguistic diversity was large as well. Today, the [[Swabian German|Swabian]], [[Bavarian language|Bavarian]], [[Low German|Saxon]] and [[Colognian language|Cologne]] [[German dialects|dialects]] in their most pure forms are estimated to be 40% [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with more modern [[Standard German]], meaning that in a conversation between any native speakers of any of these dialects and a person who speaks only standard German, the latter will be able to understand slightly less than half of what is being said without any prior knowledge of the dialect, a situation which is likely to have been similar or greater in the 19th century.<ref>[https://www.ethnologue.com/country/de/languages/***EDITION*** Ethnologue, mutual intelligibility of German dialects / Languages of Germany.]</ref>\n\nNationalism among the Germans first developed not among the general populace but among the intellectual elites of various German states. The early German nationalist [[Friedrich Karl von Moser]], writing in the mid 18th century, remarked that, compared with \"the British, Swiss, Dutch and Swedes\", the Germans lacked a \"national way of thinking\".<ref name=\"Jansen239-240\">Jansen, Christian (2011), \"The Formation of German Nationalism, 1740\u20131850,\" in: Helmut Walser Smith (Ed.), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=IPngdGug27kC&pg=PA239 The Oxford Handbook of Modern German History]''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 234-259; here: p. 239-240.</ref> However, the cultural elites themselves faced difficulties in defining the German nation, often resorting to broad and vague concepts: the Germans as a \"Sprachnation\" (a people unified by the same language), a \"Kulturnation\" (a people unified by the same culture) or an \"Erinnerungsgemeinschaft\" (a community of remembrance, i.e. sharing a common history).<ref name=\"Jansen239-240\"/> [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]]&nbsp;\u2013 considered the founding father of German nationalism<ref>The German Opposition to Hitler, Michael C. Thomsett (1997) p7.</ref>&nbsp;\u2013 devoted the 4th of his ''[[Addresses to the German Nation]]'' (1808) to defining the German nation and did so in a very broad manner. In his view, there existed a dichotomy between the people of Germanic descent. There were those who had left their fatherland (which Fichte considered to be Germany) during the time of the [[Migration Period]] and had become either assimilated or heavily influenced by [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Latin|language]], [[Culture of Ancient Rome|culture]] and [[Roman Law|customs]], and those who stayed in their native lands and continued to hold on to their own culture.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/addressestogerma00fich Address to the German Nation, p52.]</ref>\n\nLater German nationalists were able to define their nation more precisely, especially following the rise of [[Prussia]] and formation of the [[German Empire]] in 1871 which gave the majority of the German-speakers in Europe a common political, economic and educational framework.
