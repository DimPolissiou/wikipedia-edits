The series examines some of the most interesting projects being worked on by leading Irish scientists across the globe and assesses what potential impact they may have in the future. The selection of projects is diverse, ranging from the identification of a protein which may help to arrest and even reverse the onset of [[Alzheimer's disease]] to the design of a camera which can capture an extraterrestrial event that happened billions of years ago. Each programme focuses on a specific area of life such as [[Ireland in Space]], Ageing, [[Sensor]]s, [[Climate change|Climate Change]], Crops of the Future and the [[nano-|Nano]] Revolution.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tvsales.rte.ie/autumn/content/factual/the-investigators.html|title=Synopsis|accessdate=2008-11-15|publisher=[[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann|RT\u00c9 TV Sales]]}}</ref> The series airs each Thursday at 23:05.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n=== Series one ===\nSeries one was broadcast on RT\u00c9 in seven parts from 8 November 2007.<ref>[http://theinvestigators.ie/Investigators_Series1.html Series one site] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201231706/http://theinvestigators.ie/Investigators_Series1.html |date=1 February 2009 }}.

No new kittens were born after 1995, and newly arrived stray or abandoned cats were neutered or adopted to homes. However, as many proponents fail to note,TNR was not the sole reason for success. The population reduction was primarily from adoption (47%) and euthanasia (11%), or due to the cats no longer living on site with their whereabouts unknown (15%).<ref name=\"Levy 2003\" />\n* A TNR program begun in 1992 by the Merrimack River Feline Rescue Society (MRFRS) on the central waterfront of Newburyport, Massachusetts has been widely cited as an example of TNR success on a community level; however, only superficial reports about what took place have been available and there is very little statistical data to support the claims.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Spehar|first=Daniel D.|last2=Wolf|first2=Peter J.|date=2017-10-31|title=An Examination of an Iconic Trap-Neuter-Return Program: The Newburyport, Massachusetts Case Study|journal= Animals|volume=7|issue=11|pages=81|doi=10.3390/ani7110081|issn=2076-2615|pmc=5704110|pmid=29088106}}</ref>\n\nThe success of specific focused studies to advocate TNR as a solution for controlling and reducing free-roaming cat populations worldwide is problematic. More broad-based approaches include using matrix population models to estimate the efficacy of euthanasia versus trap-neuter-return for management of free-roaming cats, such as the one researchers established for use in urban environments.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Andersen|first=Mark C.|last2=Martin|first2=Brent J.|last3=Roemer|first3=Gary W.|date=2004-12-15|title=Use of matrix population models to estimate the efficacy of euthanasia versus trap-neuter-return for management of free-roaming cats|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|volume=225|issue=12|pages=1871\u20131876|issn=0003-1488|pmid=15643836|doi=10.2460/javma.2004.225.1871|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/257a3fdeaddf701df70fbb38aba568bafac3b854}}</ref>\n\nEfforts to assess the effectiveness have been hampered by the lack of sufficient monitoring data. Having some professional assistance, adapting the population monitoring framework developed over decades by wildlife biologists, and systematic monitoring can evolve into a relatively low-cost, high-value adjunct to ongoing management efforts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.acc-d.org/docs/default-source/think-tanks/frc-monitoring-revised-nov-2014.pdf|title=A Generalized Population Monitoring Program to Inform the Management of Free-Roaming Cats.|last=Boone|first=J.D.|last2=Slater|first2=M.A.|date=Nov 2014|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe potential problem of TNR advocacy and increased public awareness of non-lethal intervention actually contributing to the increasing numbers of free-roaming pets, by enabling pet owners to make conscious decisions to illegally dump or abandon their animal without having to worry about lethal control measures, has been a contentious point. In a widely cited example of cat control by relocation (cats from Bidwell Park, CA, were trapped and moved to a private sanctuary), the high visibility of the project encouraged more abandonment.<ref name=\"Levy 2004\" /> In another study, to explain the ingression of cats it was found that \"the high quality and visibility of the program ... may have encouraged abandonment of cats if owners believed that the cats would be well taken care of after abandonment. Abandonment may also have occurred if owners believed that cats would be better off under the care of the program rather than surrendered to a shelter where they would face the risk of euthanasia.\" Some of the cats that came in to the TNR colony had already been sterilized, some of these had ear-tips and some did not.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Levy|first=Julie K.|last2=Cornell|first2=Heather N.|last3=Kreisler|first3=Rachael E.|date=2019|title=Decrease in Population and Increase in Welfare of Community Cats in a Twenty-Three Year Trap-Neuter-Return Program in Key Largo, FL: The ORCAT Program|journal=Frontiers in Veterinary Science|language=English|volume=6|pages=7|doi=10.3389/fvets.2019.00007|pmid=30775368|pmc=6367225|issn=2297-1769}}</ref>\n\nIntrogression, particularly of intact cats, has been noted to be a barrier to decreasing cat populations over time through TNR efforts. It has become apparent that the while the TNR process can reduce or limit the growth rate of the colony through reproduction, it may not reduce the population numbers if it is the sole method of intervention. Population reduction occurs primarily through adoptions of non-feral cats, natural death or euthanasia of sick animals, and disappearance or emigration of cats. TNR works together with these factors to reduce reproduction and thus to minimize replacement of animals lost from the colony. Other factors such as immigration of cats from surrounding areas can counteract its effect. Thus, the impact of TNR interventions on unowned cat populations can be complex, and ongoing management of colonies becomes an important component in optimizing reductions in the cat population.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Swarbrick|first=Helen|last2=Rand|first2=Jacquie|date=2018-05-17|title=Application of a Protocol Based on Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) to Manage Unowned Urban Cats on an Australian University Campus|journal= Animals|volume=8|issue=5|pages=77|doi=10.3390/ani8050077|issn=2076-2615|pmc=5981288|pmid=29772788}}</ref>\n\nIt is important to note that the potential for TNR to decrease free-roaming cat populations has only been noted in fully managed colonies (monitored with active involvement and interventions by colony managers). Current trends towards unmanaged TNR, RTF, and/or TNS disregard the \"managed\" portion and, as such, cannot be cited as effective measures towards that goal.\n\n=== The \u201ckill\u201d or \u201cno-kill\u201d debate (euthanasia) ===\nTNR is often presented to public officials and policymakers as a viable alternative to lethal methods with several benefits.\n\n* <u>Reducing euthanasia numbers</u>. \n** It has been claimed that euthanasia in shelters is the leading cause of death of cats.<ref name=\"Levy 2004\" /> Proponents of TNR use this \"kill\" statistic to promote \"no-kill\" tactics. However, in the USA there are no exact numbers of animals being euthanized each year. Only a few states require animal shelters to keep records about animals being euthanized,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://commons.law.famu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1028&context=studentworks|title=Animal Euthanasia: Detailed Discussion|last=Kleinfeldt|first=Alexandra|date=Sep 2017|website=|publisher=Michigan State University Animal Legal & Historical Center|access-date=}}</ref> and there is no agency responsible for collecting or verifying this data. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) has noted a marked decrease in euthanasia rates since 2011<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aspca.org/animal-homelessness/shelter-intake-and-surrender/pet-statistics|title=Pet Statistics|website=ASPCA|language=en|access-date=2019-03-23}}</ref> and Humane Society of the United States reported that euthanasia of animals in shelters has been declining sharply since 1970.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanesociety.org/our-policies|title=Our policies|website=The Humane Society of the United States|language=en|access-date=2019-03-23}}</ref> In addition, the reasons for euthanasia vary. Animals may be euthanized because of shelter over-crowding, for medical reasons (illness or injury), for court-mandated reasons, or because of financial/staff limitations.\n** When the number of animals coming into a shelter exceeds its ability to care for, hold, or find foster placements, the facility may end up euthanizing animals. This could include even adoptable kittens or cats simply because they cannot be taken care of.<ref name=\"Maddie's FAQs\" /><ref name=\"Levy 2004\" /> A not atypical outcome for a cat judged to be \"feral\" after being taken to a traditional shelter not practicing [[no-kill shelter]]ing is [[Animal euthanasia|euthanasia]] (humanely putting the animal to death).<ref name=\"Maddie's FAQs\" /> \"[[Feral cat|Feral]]\" cats do not tolerate being caged or handled and many shelters are unable to manage them without putting the animal or the staff at risk. TNR could alleviate this.\n** Facilities have reported notable decreases in intakes and euthanasia since implementing TNR programs. It is not clear, however, if these decreases can be directly attributed to TNR, or to concurrent efforts to increase and implement owned pet spay-neuter programs, new initiatives of adoption campaigns where animals at risk of \"kill\" are transported to areas where animals for adoptions are needed, or public awareness campaigns to enhance adoption rates.<ref name=\"Santa Clara Co.\" />\n* <u>Cost savings</u>\n** Proponents of TNR claim that while [[neutering]] cats may be costly, [[animal euthanasia|euthanizing]] them costs more.

Denmark's Society for the Protection of Cats practiced both tattooing and tipping the ear of the neutered cats to identify them.<ref>{{Cite book|title=TNR: Past, Present and Future: A History of the Trap-Neuter-Return Movement|last=Berkeley|first=Ellen Perry|publisher=Alley Cat Allies|year=2004|isbn=0970519427|location=|pages=2\u20133}}</ref>\n\n===France===\nIn 1978, the city of Paris issued a Declaration of Rights of the Free-living Cat.<ref>[https://archive.today/20141031053412/http://82.66.132.140/chats/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=20:declaration-des-droits-du-chat&catid=21:juridique&Itemid=32 \"Declaration of Rights of the Free-living Cat (translation)\"], \u00c9cole du Chat, accessed Oct. 30, 2014.</ref> In that year, Cambazard founded \u00c9cole du Chat and TNR'd its first cat, continuing to help thousands of cats in the following years.<ref>[http://www.ecoleduchat.net/ \"History of \u00c9cole du chat (translation)\"], \u00c9cole du Chat, accessed Oct. 30, 2014.</ref>\n\n===Israel===\nLike Turkey, Israel struggles with a continually increasing population of stray cats. Cats exist in every location with people, from the southernmost city of Eilat to communities in the Golan Heights. Moreover, it is illegal in Israel to remove cats from the streets as a result of pressure from Let the Animals Live. Due to large amounts of food left by people feeding them, colonies of cats are continuing to increase, with estimates putting the population within the city of Jerusalem at 2,000 cats per square kilometer. <ref>[https://www.timesofisrael.com/jerusalem-faces-dilemma-in-dealing-with-hordes-of-stray-cats/ \"Jerusalem Dilemma in Dealing with Hordes of Stray Cats\"] </ref> Efforts to trap, neuter, return the cats within Israel are not working, as the population is too large to feasibly catch enough cats to make a difference. Moreover, there is no national agreement on what to do regarding the cat population. As a result their population is increasing with no future plan of action. In January 2019, from a push by people who feed the cats, Jerusalem plans to instill \"feeding stations\" throughout the city. The goal is to facilitate specific areas for feeding to help the populations of stray cats and to improve their welfare. This plan has been criticized by ecologists and conservationists, stating that it does nothing to help the welfare of the cats, with Amir Balaban of the Society for the Protection of Nature stating that \"If someone cares about animals, they should take them home.\" <ref>[https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-jerusalem-approves-feeding-program-for-stray-cats-experts-warn-of-consequences-1.6876426 \"Jerusalem Approves Feeding Program for Stray Cats\"] </ref>\n\n===Italy===\nKilling feral cats has been illegal in the [[Lazio|Lazio Region]], which includes [[Rome]], since 1988. A study in 2006 found almost 8,000 were neutered and reintroduced to their original colony from 1991 to 2000. It concluded that spay/neuter campaigns brought about a general decrease in cat numbers among registered colonies and censused cats, but the percentage of cat immigration (due to abandonment and spontaneous arrival) was around 21 percent. It suggested that TNR efforts without an effective education of people to control the reproduction of house cats (as a prevention for abandonment) are a waste of money, time and energy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Natoli|first=Eugenia|last2=Maragliano|first2=Laura|last3=Cariola|first3=Giuseppe|last4=Faini|first4=Anna|last5=Bonanni|first5=Roberto|last6=Cafazzo|first6=Simona|last7=Fantini|first7=Claudio|date=2006-12-18|title=Management of feral domestic cats in the urban environment of Rome (Italy)|journal=Preventive Veterinary Medicine|volume=77|issue=3\u20134|pages=180\u2013185|doi=10.1016/j.prevetmed.2006.06.005|issn=0167-5877|pmid=17034887}}</ref>\n\nSince August 1991, feral cats have been protected throughout [[Italy]] when a no-kill policy was introduced for both cats and dogs. Feral cats have the right to live free and cannot be permanently removed from their colony; cat caretakers can be formally registered; and TNR methods are outlined in the national law on the management of pets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223135898|title=Stray dog and cat laws and enforcement in Czech Republic and in Italy|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2019-04-02}}</ref>\n\n===South Korea===\nNegative attitudes towards cats in general and free-roaming cats in particular are culturally entrenched. Cats are culled for meat, or for body parts used in concocting health aids.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://koreananimals.org/cats/|title=Cats {{!}} International Aid for Korean Animals|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-04}}</ref> The 2011 South Korean amendment of its Animal Protection Law required humane methods to be used in the transportation and euthanasia of animals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://koreananimals.org/south-koreas-animal-protection-laws/|title=South Korea's Animal Protection Laws {{!}} International Aid for Korean Animals|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-04}}</ref> Some areas have government supported TNR programs, but these programs are often scorned by the public and poorly managed. Negative attitudes and fear towards cats in general have been slow to change and free-roaming cats may be subjected to abuse or violence. In recent years, however, South Korea's attitude toward homeless cats has improved.\n\n=== New Zealand ===\nThe Department of Conservation (DOC) is legislatively mandated to control feral cats on public conservation land. It has eradicated feral cats from several offshore islands. Control techniques include poisoning, trapping and shooting. Lethal controls follow efficient and humane best-practice techniques and adhere to the Animal Welfare Act 1999.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.doc.govt.nz/nature/pests-and-threats/animal-pests/feral-cats/|title=Feral cats|website=www.doc.govt.nz|language=en-nz|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, the New Zealand Companion Animal Council released its National Cat Management Strategy Discussion Paper, in which they advise that \"when stray cat management is justified, non-lethal methods of removal (e.g. rehoming or best practice managed, targeted trap-neuter-return [mtTNR]) must always be the first option.\" This discussion recognized the limited value of mtTNR in some situations. Their goal is for all cats in New Zealand to be responsibly owned and that cats are humanely managed in a way that protects their welfare and the environment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nzcac.org.nz/nzcac/nzcac-resources/nzcac-newsletters/7-blog/83-national-cat-management-strategy-discussion-paper|title=National Cat Management Strategy Discussion Paper - New Zealand Companion Animal Council|website=www.nzcac.org.nz|access-date=2019-04-05}}</ref>\n\n=== Turkey ===\nTurkey has a significant problem with free-roaming dogs and cats and the country is struggling with ways to manage the problem. Its Animal Protection Law prohibits killing \u201cownerless animals\u201d except where permitted by the Animal Health Police Law. They are required to be taken to animal shelters established or permitted by the local authorities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://api.worldanimalprotection.org/country/turkey|title=Turkey {{!}} World Animal Protection|website=api.worldanimalprotection.org|access-date=2019-04-05}}</ref> In keeping with the tenents of its main religion, most Turks are very much against euthanasia of animals for \u201cpopulation control;\u201d recent efforts to curb an ever-increasing population include TNR for roaming cats and dogs.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://animalbehaviorassociates.com/blog/managing-street-dogs-cats-turkey/|title=Managing Street Dogs and Cats in Turkey {{!}} Dog and Cat Behavior {{!}} Dog and Cat Behavior|website=animalbehaviorassociates.com|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.animalwelfareintergroup.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Odessa-programme-DTB.pdf|title=Stray Dog and Cat Feral Populations in Europe: from Culling to Care|last=Furler-Mihali|first=Andrea Irina|date=April 2017|website=|location=|type=|access-date=|quote=}}</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\nThe earliest documented practice of trap\u2013neuter\u2013return was in the 1950s, led by animal activist Ruth Plant in the UK. In the mid-1960s, former model [[Celia Hammond]] gained publicity for her TNR work \"at a time when euthanasia of feral cats was considered the only option\". Hammond \"fought many battles with local authorities, hospitals, environmental health departments\" but stated that she succeeded over the years in showing that control \"could be achieved by neutering and not killing\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.celiahammond.org/index.php|title=Celia Hammond Animal Trust - UK Animal Rescue Charity|website=www.celiahammond.org|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref>\n\nThe first scientific conference on \u201cthe ecology and control of feral cats\u201d was held in London in 1980 and its proceedings published by the [[Universities Federation for Animal Welfare]] (UFAW). Subsequent UFAW publications in 1982, 1990, and 1995 were the primary scientific references for feral-cat control for many years.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://animalstudiesrepository.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1003&context=sota_2005|title=Feral Cats: An Overview|last=Slater|first=Margaret R.|last2=Shain|first2=Stephanie|publisher=Humane Society Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=Washington DC|pages=43\u201353}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, the [[Scottish Wildcat Association]] began utilizing TNR of feral cats to protect the regionally endangered [[European wildcat|Scottish wildcat]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wildcathaven.com/|title=Wildcat Haven C.I.C|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Their goals include:\n\n* Saving the genetically pure Scottish wildcat\n* Removing all feral cats from the region\n* Using humane, neutering-based feral cat controls\n* Establishing buffer zones to prevent feral cats returning to the area\n\n===United States===\nCurrently, there is no applicable federal law that controls the feral cat issue. A few states have recently recognized the need to establish programs to control feral cat populations since their effects on wildlife have now been more widely studied and the efficacy of euthanasia for population management has been criticized. These laws vary in their approaches. The Endangered Species Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, have played a role in setting forth policy on feral cats. The federal case, ''American Bird Conservancy v. Harvey'', puts the challenge of bird advocates under these federal laws in response to cat programs front and center. The merits of this case have not been decided but have the potential to impact both sides of the issue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.animallaw.info/intro/feral-cat-and-wild-bird-controversy|title=Feral Cat and Wild Bird Controversy {{!}} Animal Legal & Historical Center|website=www.animallaw.info|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref>\n\nIn a January 2013 legal brief, [[Alley Cat Allies]] provided evidence that at least 240 municipal or county governments in the United States had enacted ordinances supporting TNR; a ten-fold increase from 2003.<ref name=\"ACA Brief\" /> [[New Jersey]], [[California]] and [[Texas]] had the highest number of local ordinances.<ref name=\"ACA Brief\" /> New York City-based organization Neighborhood Cats has cataloged local ordinances in 24 US states.<ref name=\"TNROrdinances\">{{cite web |url=http://www.neighborhoodcats.org/RESOURCES_ORDINANCES |title=TNR Ordinances |publisher=Neighbourhood Cats |access-date=August 3, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723081408/http://www.neighborhoodcats.org/RESOURCES_ORDINANCES |archivedate=July 23, 2014}}</ref> Model ordinances are available from Neighborhood Cats,<ref name=\"TNROrdinances\" /> Alley Cat Allies,<ref name=\"ACA Brief\" /> and the No Kill Advocacy Center.<ref>[http://www.nokilladvocacycenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/FeralPolicy.pdf \"A Model Feral Cat Policy\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140417070949/http://www.nokilladvocacycenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/FeralPolicy.pdf |date=2014-04-17 }}, [[No Kill Advocacy Center]], ''No Kill Sheltering'', November/December 2006.</ref>\n\nOn January 29, 2019, the Hawaii Invasive Species Council adopted a resolution supporting the keeping of pet cats indoors and the use of peer-reviewed science in pursuing humane mitigation of the impacts of feral cats on wildlife and people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/hisc/news/resolution-19-2-keeping-cats-indoors-using-peer-reviewed-science/|title=Resolution 19-2: Keeping Cats Indoors & Using Peer-Reviewed Science|date=2019-02-01|website=Hawaii Invasive Species Council|language=en|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref>\n\nTNR of cats is illegal in Alaska.\n\nGovernments have been sued to try to block their TNR efforts.

The perplexing issues of where a \"feral\" cat fits in local ordinance depends on the consideration as to whether they are pets or wildlife and whether they are \"owned\" or not. Many ordinances restrict feeding of wildlife (excluding birds). Then there are ordinances that restrict how many pets a person may own, and those that disallow free-roaming pets. In 2011, charges against Danni Joshua of [[Vandercook Lake, Michigan]] for \"allowing animals to run loose\" were dismissed when she agreed to have her colony of 15-20 cats relocated.<ref>[http://www.mlive.com/news/jackson/index.ssf/2011/11/feral_cat_case_dropped_against.html \"Feral cat case dropped against Vandercook Lake woman under plan to trap and remove cats from neighbourhood\"], Brad Flory, ''MLive''; Advance Local Media; November 16, 2011.</ref> In 2012, 78-year-old Dawn Summers was sentenced to community service for 'hoarding\"; she was feeding up to 27 community cats within a managed colony in a city-sanctioned program in [[Biloxi, Mississippi]].<ref>[http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2012/12/12/177195/biloxi-womans-sentence-in-feral.html \"Biloxi woman's sentence in feral cats case draws national attention\"], Robin Fitzgerald, Biloxi Sun-Herald, December 12, 2012.</ref> Alley Cat Allies criticized the decision, stating that the community cats should not have been considered owned by the caregiver.<ref>[http://www.alleycat.org/page.aspx?pid=1390 \"Alley Cat Allies Criticizes Biloxi Judge for Misguided Punishment of Feral Cat Caregiver\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812100915/http://www.alleycat.org/page.aspx?pid=1390 |date=2014-08-12 }}, Alley Cat Allies, accessed August 3, 2014.</ref>  The [[Virginia]] Supreme Court found a zoning ordinance too broad in 2013, when [[Henrico County]] charged Susan Mills for caring for feral cats, which the county said was not a permitted activity under the zoning.

No new kittens were born after 1995, and newly arrived stray or abandoned cats were neutered or adopted to homes. However, as many proponents fail to note,TNR was not the sole reason for success. The population reduction was primarily from adoption (47%) and euthanasia (11%), or due to the cats no longer living on site with their whereabouts unknown (15%).<ref name=\"Levy 2003\" />\n* A TNR program begun in 1992 by the Merrimack River Feline Rescue Society (MRFRS) on the central waterfront of Newburyport, Massachusetts has been widely cited as an example of TNR success on a community level; however, only superficial reports about what took place have been available and there is very little statistical data to support the claims.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Spehar|first=Daniel D.|last2=Wolf|first2=Peter J.|date=2017-10-31|title=An Examination of an Iconic Trap-Neuter-Return Program: The Newburyport, Massachusetts Case Study|journal= Animals|volume=7|issue=11|pages=81|doi=10.3390/ani7110081|issn=2076-2615|pmc=5704110|pmid=29088106}}</ref>\n\nThe success of specific focused studies to advocate TNR as a solution for controlling and reducing free-roaming cat populations worldwide is problematic. More broad-based approaches include using matrix population models to estimate the efficacy of euthanasia versus trap-neuter-return for management of free-roaming cats, such as the one researchers established for use in urban environments.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Andersen|first=Mark C.|last2=Martin|first2=Brent J.|last3=Roemer|first3=Gary W.|date=2004-12-15|title=Use of matrix population models to estimate the efficacy of euthanasia versus trap-neuter-return for management of free-roaming cats|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|volume=225|issue=12|pages=1871\u20131876|issn=0003-1488|pmid=15643836|doi=10.2460/javma.2004.225.1871|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/257a3fdeaddf701df70fbb38aba568bafac3b854}}</ref>\n\nEfforts to assess the effectiveness have been hampered by the lack of sufficient monitoring data.

In a widely cited example of cat control by relocation (cats from Bidwell Park, CA, were trapped and moved to a private sanctuary), the high visibility of the project encouraged more abandonment.<ref name=\"Levy 2004\" /> In another study, to explain the ingression of cats it was found that \"the high quality and visibility of the program ... may have encouraged abandonment of cats if owners believed that the cats would be well taken care of after abandonment. Abandonment may also have occurred if owners believed that cats would be better off under the care of the program rather than surrendered to a shelter where they would face the risk of euthanasia.\" Some of that cats that came in to the TNR colony has already been sterilized, some of these had ear-tips and some did not.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Levy|first=Julie K.|last2=Cornell|first2=Heather N.|last3=Kreisler|first3=Rachael E.|date=2019|title=Decrease in Population and Increase in Welfare of Community Cats in a Twenty-Three Year Trap-Neuter-Return Program in Key Largo, FL: The ORCAT Program|journal=Frontiers in Veterinary Science|language=English|volume=6|pages=7|doi=10.3389/fvets.2019.00007|pmid=30775368|pmc=6367225|issn=2297-1769}}</ref>\n\nIntrogression, particularly of intact cats, has been noted to be a barrier to decreasing cat populations over time through TNR efforts. It has become apparent that the while the TNR process can reduce or limit the growth rate of the colony through reproduction, it may not reduce the population numbers if it is the sole method of intervention. Population reduction occurs primarily through adoptions of non-feral cats, natural death or euthanasia of sick animals, and disappearance or emigration of cats. TNR works together with these factors to reduce reproduction and thus to minimize replacement of animals lost from the colony.

A common feature of the accelerating trend is a requirement that owners get a license for their cats and ensure they don't roam.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macleans.ca/society/why-reining-in-canadian-cat-populations-wont-be-easy/|title=The problem with cats - Macleans.ca|website=www.macleans.ca|access-date=2019-04-02}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2012, a bylaw officer in [[Merritt, British Columbia]], removed cat food and asked the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] to consider criminal charges against those feeding the community cats.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/merritt-b-c-overrun-by-stray-cats-1.1226798 \"Merritt, B.C., overrun by stray cats: Bylaw officers ask RCMP to consider mischief charges against animal feeders\"], ''CBC News'', January 11, 2012.</ref><ref>[http://www.merrittherald.com/citys-approach-to-feral-cats-not-effective/ \"City's approach to feral cats not effective\"], Joni Hughes, letter to ''Merritt Herald'', January 12, 2012.</ref> No charges were laid, but the rescue group's business license was revoked and it was forced to move from its storefront location.<ref>[http://www.merrittherald.com/merritt-storefront-clear-of-stray-cats/ \"Merritt storefront clear of stray cats\"], Phillip Woolgar, ''Merritt Herald'', August 7, 2012.</ref>\n\nThe City of [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], includes TNR in its animal services and has a bylaw specifically addressing TNR and managed colonies.<ref>[http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=a5bb39220b2c1410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD \"The Trap, Neuter, Return Program for Feral Cats\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808053437/http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=a5bb39220b2c1410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD|date=2014-08-08}}, City of Toronto, accessed August 3, 2014; and [http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/municode/1184_349.pdf \"Toronto Municipal Code, Chapter 349, Animals\"], City of Toronto, June 13, 2013.</ref> The Toronto Animal Services offers spay and neuter for colonies that are registered and have an assigned trained caretaker.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/animals-pets/spay-neuter-services/trap-neuter-return-program-for-feral-cats/|title=Trap, Neuter, Return Program (TNR) for Feral Cats|date=2017-10-27|website=City of Toronto|language=en-CA|access-date=2019-04-02}}</ref>\n\n===Denmark===\nTNR was practiced in [[Denmark]] in the mid-1970s, as reported at the 1980 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare (UFAW) symposium in London. Denmark's Society for the Protection of Cats practiced both tattooing and tipping the ear of the neutered cats to identify them.<ref>{{Cite book|title=TNR: Past, Present and Future: A History of the Trap-Neuter-Return Movement|last=Berkeley|first=Ellen Perry|publisher=Alley Cat Allies|year=2004|isbn=0970519427|location=|pages=2\u20133}}</ref>\n\n===France===\nIn 1978, the city of Paris issued a Declaration of Rights of the Free-living Cat.<ref>[https://archive.today/20141031053412/http://82.66.132.140/chats/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=20:declaration-des-droits-du-chat&catid=21:juridique&Itemid=32 \"Declaration of Rights of the Free-living Cat (translation)\"], \u00c9cole du Chat, accessed Oct. 30, 2014.</ref> In that year, Cambazard founded \u00c9cole du Chat and TNR'd its first cat, continuing to help thousands of cats in the following years.<ref>[http://www.ecoleduchat.net/ \"History of \u00c9cole du chat (translation)\"], \u00c9cole du Chat, accessed Oct. 30, 2014.</ref>\n\n===Israel===\nLike Turkey, Israel struggles with a continually increasing population of stray cats. Cats exist in every location with people, from the southernmost city of Eilat to communities in the Golan Heights. Moreover, it is illegal in Israel to remove cats from the streets as a result of pressure from Let the Animals Live. Due to large amounts of food left by people feeding them, colonies of cats are continuing to increase, with estimates putting the population within the city of Jerusalem at 2,000 cats per square kilometer. <ref>[https://www.timesofisrael.com/jerusalem-faces-dilemma-in-dealing-with-hordes-of-stray-cats/ \"Jerusalem Dilemma in Dealing with Hordes of Stray Cats\"] </ref> Efforts to trap, neuter, return the cats within Israel are not working, as the population is too large to feasibly catch enough cats to make a difference. Moreover, there is no national agreement on what to do regarding the cat population. As a result their population is increasing with no future plan of action. In January 2019, from a push by people who feed the cats, Jerusalem plans to instill \"feeding stations\" throughout the city. The goal is to facilitate specific areas for feeding to help the populations of stray cats and to improve their welfare. This plan has been criticized by ecologists and conservationists, stating that it does nothing to help the welfare of the cats, with Amir Balaban of the Society for the Protection of Nature stating that \"If someone cares about animals, they should take them home.\" <ref>[https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-jerusalem-approves-feeding-program-for-stray-cats-experts-warn-of-consequences-1.6876426 \"Jerusalem Approves Feeding Program for Stray Cats\"] </ref>\n\n===Italy===\nKilling feral cats has been illegal in the [[Lazio|Lazio Region]], which includes [[Rome]], since 1988. A study in 2006 found almost 8,000 were neutered and reintroduced to their original colony from 1991 to 2000. It concluded that spay/neuter campaigns brought about a general decrease in cat numbers among registered colonies and censused cats, but the percentage of cat immigration (due to abandonment and spontaneous arrival) was around 21 percent. It suggested that TNR efforts without an effective education of people to control the reproduction of house cats (as a prevention for abandonment) are a waste of money, time and energy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Natoli|first=Eugenia|last2=Maragliano|first2=Laura|last3=Cariola|first3=Giuseppe|last4=Faini|first4=Anna|last5=Bonanni|first5=Roberto|last6=Cafazzo|first6=Simona|last7=Fantini|first7=Claudio|date=2006-12-18|title=Management of feral domestic cats in the urban environment of Rome (Italy)|journal=Preventive Veterinary Medicine|volume=77|issue=3\u20134|pages=180\u2013185|doi=10.1016/j.prevetmed.2006.06.005|issn=0167-5877|pmid=17034887}}</ref>\n\nSince August 1991, feral cats have been protected throughout [[Italy]] when a no-kill policy was introduced for both cats and dogs. Feral cats have the right to live free and cannot be permanently removed from their colony; cat caretakers can be formally registered; and TNR methods are outlined in the national law on the management of pets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223135898|title=Stray dog and cat laws and enforcement in Czech Republic and in Italy|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2019-04-02}}</ref>\n\n===South Korea===\nNegative attitudes towards cats in general and free-roaming cats in particular are culturally entrenched. Cats are culled for meat, or for body parts used in concocting health aids.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://koreananimals.org/cats/|title=Cats {{!}} International Aid for Korean Animals|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-04}}</ref> The 2011 South Korean amendment of its Animal Protection Law required humane methods to be used in the transportation and euthanasia of animals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://koreananimals.org/south-koreas-animal-protection-laws/|title=South Korea's Animal Protection Laws {{!}} International Aid for Korean Animals|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-04}}</ref> Some areas have government supported TNR programs, but these programs are often scorned by the public and poorly managed. Negative attitudes and fear towards cats in general have been slow to change and free-roaming cats may be subjected to abuse or violence. In recent years, however, South Korea's attitude toward homeless cats has improved.\n\n=== New Zealand ===\nThe Department of Conservation (DOC) is legislatively mandated to control feral cats on public conservation land. It has eradicated feral cats from several offshore islands. Control techniques include poisoning, trapping and shooting. Lethal controls follow efficient and humane best-practice techniques and adhere to the Animal Welfare Act 1999.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.doc.govt.nz/nature/pests-and-threats/animal-pests/feral-cats/|title=Feral cats|website=www.doc.govt.nz|language=en-nz|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, the New Zealand Companion Animal Council released its National Cat Management Strategy Discussion Paper, in which they advise that \"when stray cat management is justified, non-lethal methods of removal (e.g. rehoming or best practice managed, targeted trap-neuter-return [mtTNR]) must always be the first option.\" This discussion recognized the limited value of mtTNR in some situations. Their goal is for all cats in New Zealand to be responsibly owned and that cats are humanely managed in a way that protects their welfare and the environment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nzcac.org.nz/nzcac/nzcac-resources/nzcac-newsletters/7-blog/83-national-cat-management-strategy-discussion-paper|title=National Cat Management Strategy Discussion Paper - New Zealand Companion Animal Council|website=www.nzcac.org.nz|access-date=2019-04-05}}</ref>\n\n=== Turkey ===\nTurkey has a significant problem with free-roaming dogs and cats and the country is struggling with ways to manage the problem. Its Animal Protection Law prohibits killing \u201cownerless animals\u201d except where permitted by the Animal Health Police Law. They are required to be taken to animal shelters established or permitted by the local authorities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://api.worldanimalprotection.org/country/turkey|title=Turkey {{!}} World Animal Protection|website=api.worldanimalprotection.org|access-date=2019-04-05}}</ref> In keeping with the tenents of its main religion, most Turks are very much against euthanasia of animals for \u201cpopulation control;\u201d recent efforts to curb an ever-increasing population include TNR for roaming cats and dogs.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://animalbehaviorassociates.com/blog/managing-street-dogs-cats-turkey/|title=Managing Street Dogs and Cats in Turkey {{!}} Dog and Cat Behavior {{!}} Dog and Cat Behavior|website=animalbehaviorassociates.com|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.animalwelfareintergroup.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Odessa-programme-DTB.pdf|title=Stray Dog and Cat Feral Populations in Europe: from Culling to Care|last=Furler-Mihali|first=Andrea Irina|date=April 2017|website=|location=|type=|access-date=|quote=}}</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\nThe earliest documented practice of trap\u2013neuter\u2013return was in the 1950s, led by animal activist Ruth Plant in the UK. In the mid-1960s, former model [[Celia Hammond]] gained publicity for her TNR work \"at a time when euthanasia of feral cats was considered the only option\". Hammond \"fought many battles with local authorities, hospitals, environmental health departments\" but stated that she succeeded over the years in showing that control \"could be achieved by neutering and not killing\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.celiahammond.org/index.php|title=Celia Hammond Animal Trust - UK Animal Rescue Charity|website=www.celiahammond.org|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref>\n\nThe first scientific conference on \u201cthe ecology and control of feral cats\u201d was held in London in 1980 and its proceedings published by the [[Universities Federation for Animal Welfare]] (UFAW). Subsequent UFAW publications in 1982, 1990, and 1995 were the primary scientific references for feral-cat control for many years.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://animalstudiesrepository.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1003&context=sota_2005|title=Feral Cats: An Overview|last=Slater|first=Margaret R.|last2=Shain|first2=Stephanie|publisher=Humane Society Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=Washington DC|pages=43\u201353}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, the [[Scottish Wildcat Association]] began utilizing TNR of feral cats to protect the regionally endangered [[European wildcat|Scottish wildcat]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wildcathaven.com/|title=Wildcat Haven C.I.C|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Their goals include:\n\n* Saving the genetically pure Scottish wildcat\n* Removing all feral cats from the region\n* Using humane, neutering-based feral cat controls\n* Establishing buffer zones to prevent feral cats returning to the area\n\n===United States===\nCurrently, there is no applicable federal law that controls the feral cat issue. A few states have recently recognized the need to establish programs to control feral cat populations since their effects on wildlife have now been more widely studied and the efficacy of euthanasia for population management has been criticized. These laws vary in their approaches. The Endangered Species Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, have played a role in setting forth policy on feral cats. The federal case, ''American Bird Conservancy v. Harvey'', puts the challenge of bird advocates under these federal laws in response to cat programs front and center. The merits of this case have not been decided but have the potential to impact both sides of the issue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.animallaw.info/intro/feral-cat-and-wild-bird-controversy|title=Feral Cat and Wild Bird Controversy {{!}} Animal Legal & Historical Center|website=www.animallaw.info|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref>\n\nIn a January 2013 legal brief, [[Alley Cat Allies]] provided evidence that at least 240 municipal or county governments in the United States had enacted ordinances supporting TNR; a ten-fold increase from 2003.<ref name=\"ACA Brief\" /> [[New Jersey]], [[California]] and [[Texas]] had the highest number of local ordinances.<ref name=\"ACA Brief\" /> New York City-based organization Neighborhood Cats has cataloged local ordinances in 24 US states.<ref name=\"TNROrdinances\">{{cite web |url=http://www.neighborhoodcats.org/RESOURCES_ORDINANCES |title=TNR Ordinances |publisher=Neighbourhood Cats |access-date=August 3, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723081408/http://www.neighborhoodcats.org/RESOURCES_ORDINANCES |archivedate=July 23, 2014}}</ref> Model ordinances are available from Neighborhood Cats,<ref name=\"TNROrdinances\" /> Alley Cat Allies,<ref name=\"ACA Brief\" /> and the No Kill Advocacy Center.<ref>[http://www.nokilladvocacycenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/FeralPolicy.pdf \"A Model Feral Cat Policy\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140417070949/http://www.nokilladvocacycenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/FeralPolicy.pdf |date=2014-04-17 }}, [[No Kill Advocacy Center]], ''No Kill Sheltering'', November/December 2006.</ref>\n\nOn January 29, 2019, the Hawaii Invasive Species Council adopted a resolution supporting the keeping of pet cats indoors and the use of peer-reviewed science in pursuing humane mitigation of the impacts of feral cats on wildlife and people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/hisc/news/resolution-19-2-keeping-cats-indoors-using-peer-reviewed-science/|title=Resolution 19-2: Keeping Cats Indoors & Using Peer-Reviewed Science|date=2019-02-01|website=Hawaii Invasive Species Council|language=en|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref>\n\nTNR of cats is illegal in Alaska.\n\nGovernments have been sued to try to block their TNR efforts.

The perplexing issues of where a \"feral\" cat fits in local ordinance depends on the consideration as to whether they are pets or wildlife and whether they are \"owned\" or not. Many ordinances restrict feeding of wildlife (excluding birds). Then there are ordinances that restrict how many pets a person may own, and those that disallow free-roaming pets. In 2011, charges against Danni Joshua of [[Vandercook Lake, Michigan]] for \"allowing animals to run loose\" were dismissed when she agreed to have her colony of 15-20 cats relocated.<ref>[http://www.mlive.com/news/jackson/index.ssf/2011/11/feral_cat_case_dropped_against.html \"Feral cat case dropped against Vandercook Lake woman under plan to trap and remove cats from neighbourhood\"], Brad Flory, ''MLive''; Advance Local Media; November 16, 2011.</ref> In 2012, 78-year-old Dawn Summers was sentenced to community service for 'hoarding\"; she was feeding up to 27 community cats within a managed colony in a city-sanctioned program in [[Biloxi, Mississippi]].<ref>[http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2012/12/12/177195/biloxi-womans-sentence-in-feral.html \"Biloxi woman's sentence in feral cats case draws national attention\"], Robin Fitzgerald, Biloxi Sun-Herald, December 12, 2012.</ref> Alley Cat Allies criticized the decision, stating that the community cats should not have been considered owned by the caregiver.<ref>[http://www.alleycat.org/page.aspx?pid=1390 \"Alley Cat Allies Criticizes Biloxi Judge for Misguided Punishment of Feral Cat Caregiver\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812100915/http://www.alleycat.org/page.aspx?pid=1390 |date=2014-08-12 }}, Alley Cat Allies, accessed August 3, 2014.</ref>  The [[Virginia]] Supreme Court found a zoning ordinance too broad in 2013, when [[Henrico County]] charged Susan Mills for caring for feral cats, which the county said was not a permitted activity under the zoning.

Cooke is best known for his death in hand-to-hand combat with French forces during the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. During the action, his ship {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} was badly damaged and boarded by sailors and marines from the French [[ship of the line]] {{Ship|French ship|Aigle|1800|2}}. Cooke was killed in the ensuing melee, but his crew successfully drove off their opponents and ultimately forced the surrender of ''Aigle''.\n\nAside from his death, remarkably little is known of Cooke's circumstances, as unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well respected in his profession and following his death was the subject of tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and his local church in [[Wiltshire]].\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Cooke was baptised on 5 March 1762 at [[St. Mary, Whitechapel]], the second son of Francis Cooke, an [[Admiralty]] clerk, and his wife Margaret.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{Ref label|A|a|none}} John Cooke first went to sea at the age of eleven aboard the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] {{HMS|Greyhound|1763|6}} under Lieutenant [[John Bazely]], before going ashore to spend time at Mr Braken's naval academy at [[Greenwich]]. He was entered onto the books of one of the [[royal yacht]]s by [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Sir Alexander Hood]], who would become an enduring patron of Cooke's.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} In 1776 he obtained a position as a [[midshipman]] on the [[ship of the line]] {{HMS|Eagle|1774|6}}, aged thirteen.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Cooke served aboard ''Eagle'', the flagship of the [[North American Station]], during the next three years, seeing extensive action along the eastern seaboard. Notable among these actions were the naval operations around the [[Battle of Rhode Island]] in 1778, when ''Eagle'' was closely engaged with American units ashore.{{r|\"ODNB\"}} He distinguished himself in the assault, causing Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] to remark \"Why, young man, you wish to become a Lieutenant before you are of sufficient age.\"{{r|\"NT:95\"}} On 21 January 1779, Cooke was promoted to [[lieutenant]] and joined {{HMS|Superb|1760|6}} in the East Indies under [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]], but was forced to take a leave of absence due to ill-health.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\nCooke returned to England and then went to France to spend a year studying, before rejoining the navy in 1782 with an appointment to the 90-gun {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} under Captain [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Alan Gardner]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Cooke saw action at the [[Battle of the Saintes]], at which ''Duke'' was heavily engaged. He remained with Gardner following the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, bringing an end to the American War of Independence, and served as his first-lieutenant aboard his next command, the 50-gun {{HMS|Europa|1783|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Gardner became commodore at [[Jamaica]], flying his [[broad pennant]] aboard ''Europa'' and retaining Cooke as his first-lieutenant until Cooke was injured in a bad fall and had to be invalided home.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} He had recovered sufficiently by the time of the [[Spanish Armament]] in 1790 to be able to take up an appointment from his old patron, Sir Alexander Hood, to be third-lieutenant of his flagship, the 90-gun {{HMS|London|1766|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{r|\"ODNB\"}} When the crisis passed without breaking into open war, ''London'' was paid off and Cooke went ashore.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\n==Frigate command==\nWith the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in February 1793, Cooke rejoined Hood and became first-lieutenant of his new flagship, the 100-gun {{HMS|Royal George|1788|6}}, part of the [[Channel Fleet]]. On 21 February 1794, Cooke was promoted to [[commander]] and given his first independent command, the small [[fireship]] {{HMS|Incendiary|1782|6}}. Three months later, ''Incendiary'' was a signal repeater for the Channel Fleet during the [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794]], relaying [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe's]] signals to the fleet and operating as a scout in the search for the French fleet under [[Villaret de Joyeuse]]. On 1 June 1794, Cooke was a witness to the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], although his tiny ship was far too small to engage in combat.{{r|\"JW1:126\"}} In the action's aftermath, Cooke was included in the general promotions issued to the fleet, becoming a [[post captain]] on 23 July 1794. For a year, Cooke was stationed off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] as [[flag captain]] to [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] aboard the 74-gun {{HMS|Monarch|1765|6}}, before returning to Britain and being offered command of the 28-gun {{HMS|Tourterelle|1795|6}}.{{r|\"NT:96\"}} Cooke accepted, but when he found out she was ordered to the West Indies, he resigned it, having been told by Gardner that further service in the West Indies would likely kill him.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nInstead in early 1796 he took command of the 36-gun [[frigate]] {{HMS|Nymphe|1780|6}}. ''Nymphe'' was employed in the blockade of the French Atlantic ports over the next year, and on 9 March 1797 was in company with {{HMS|St Fiorenzo|1794|6}} when they encountered the returning ships of a short-lived [[Battle of Fishguard|French invasion attempt]] of Britain that had been defeated at [[Fishguard]] in [[Wales]].{{r|\"JW2:80\"}} The French ships attempted to escape into [[Brest, France|Brest]], but were hunted down by the British, who forced the surrender of [[French ship R\u00e9sistance|''R\u00e9sistance'']] and [[French ship Constance|''Constance'']] in turn after successive short engagements.{{r|\"JH:45\"}} Neither of the British ships suffered a single casualty in the combat, and both French ships were subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy, bringing [[prize money]] to Cooke and his crew.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=14035|page=764|date=8 August 1797}}</ref>\n\nDespite this success, Cooke was unpopular with his men due to the strict discipline he enforced aboard his ship. This was graphically demonstrated just two months after the action off Brest, when ''Nymphe'' became embroiled in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Spithead mutiny]]. Cooke attempted to assist Admiral [[John Colpoys]] at the mutiny's outbreak, and was ordered ashore by his crew when he tried to return to his ship. Cooke was tactfully removed from command by the Admiralty following the mutiny, although he was returned to service two years later aboard the new frigate {{HMS|Amethyst|1799|6}} in preparation for the Anglo-Russian invasion of the [[Batavian Republic]].{{r|\"CW:48\"}} During the invasion, ''Amethyst'' conveyed the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] to the Netherlands and later participated in the evacuation of the force following the campaign's collapse.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nCooke was involved in operations in [[Quiberon Bay]] during the remainder of 1799, and in 1800 participated in an abortive invasion of [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]]. During this time, ''Amethyst'' captured six French merchant ships and small privateers.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15301|page=1176|date=11 October 1800}}</ref> During 1801, Cooke participated in the capture of the {{Ship|French frigate|D\u00e9daigneuse|1797|2|up=yes}} off [[Cape Finisterre]], helping [[Samuel Hood Linzee]] and [[Sir Richard King, 2nd Baronet|Richard King]] chase her down on 26 January. ''Amethyst'' was not heavily engaged with ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' and received no damage, but aided in pursuing and trapping the French ship so that she could be seized. ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' was later purchased into the Royal Navy as HMS ''Dedaigneuse''.{{r|\"JW3:136\"}} Shortly afterwards, Cooke captured the Spanish ship ''Carlotta'' and the French [[privateer]] ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Brune'' in the same area.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15412|page=1203|date=29 September 1801}}</ref>\n\n==Trafalgar==\n[[File:Trafalgar aufstellung.jpg|thumb|Battle of Trafalgar]]\nWith the [[Peace of Amiens]], Cooke briefly retired on half-pay before being recalled to the fleet at the outbreak of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1803. Cooke was requested as flag captain by Admiral [[William Young (1751\u20131821)|Sir William Young]] at [[Plymouth]], but Cooke tactfully refused, instead applying for active service. He received command of {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} on 25 April 1805. In May, after the large combined French and Spanish fleet, under Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] escaped from [[Toulon]], beginning the [[Trafalgar Campaign]], Cooke was ordered to join a flying squadron under Vice-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]]. The squadron arrived off [[Cadiz]] on 9 June and Collingwood detached ''Bellerophon'' and three other ships to blockade [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Richard Bickerton, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Bickerton]]. When the combined fleet entered Cadiz on 20 August, Collingwood recalled Bickerton's force and mounted a blockade of the port. Collingwood was reinforced with more ships, and was later superseded by Nelson. Cooke was heard to say at this time that \"To be in a general engagement with [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] would crown all my military ambition\".{{r|\"ODNB\"}} Nelson had Villeneuve's fleet trapped in Cadiz and was blockading the harbour awaiting their expected attempt to escape.\n\nThe Franco-Spanish fleet escaped Cadiz on 18 October 1805, but was soon chased down by Nelson and brought to battle on 21 October. Nelson formed his fleet into two divisions; the weather column would attack to the north under his direct command and the lee column would operate to the south under the command of Cuthbert Collingwood in {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1786|6}}. Cooke was stationed fifth in Collingwood's line, and so was one of the first ships engaged in action with the combined fleet. Cooke took the unusual step of informing his first lieutenant [[William Pryce Cumby]] and his master Edward Overton of Nelson's orders, in case he should be killed.{{r|\"CW:47\"}}\n\n''Bellerophon'' was soon closely engaged with the French, breaking through the enemy line and closing with [[French ship Aigle (1800)|''Aigle'']]. As with the other French ships in the fleet, ''Aigle's'' rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on ''Bellerophon'' and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was still wearing his uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied \"It is too late to take them off. I see my situation, but I will die like a man\".{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n[[File:Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Coloured print of a naval battle between sailing ships. Four ships seen stern on in the right of the picture, obscured by clouds of smoke, a fifth ship seen bow on in the left.|''Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke'', early-nineteenth century aquatint by [[Thomas Whitcombe]], showing the ''Bellerophon'' surrounded by enemy ships at the moment of Cooke's death]]\nAs the action continued, the Captain Pierre-Paul Gour\u00e8ge of ''Aigle'' ordered his crew to board and seize ''Bellerophon'', hoping to use their superiority of numbers to overwhelm the British crew. Cooke sent Cumby below to make sure that the lower-deck guns continued to fire into the French ship as the battle continued overhead, and threw himself at the French sailors pouring onto ''Bellerophon's'' quarterdeck, shooting an enemy officer dead and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the men behind him.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Within minutes Cumby had returned to the deck with reinforcements from below, passing the mortally wounded Overton on the ladder. The badly wounded ship's quartermaster was also present, and he informed Cumby that Cooke had fallen in the melee.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Cumby's charge cleared the French from the deck of ''Bellerophon'', and he found Cooke dead on the quarterdeck, two [[musket]] balls lodged in his chest. Cooke's last words had been \"Let me lie quietly a minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n\nCumby took charge of the battered ''Bellerophon'', directing her fire into ''Aigle'' and ultimately forcing the French ship's surrender after the arrival of other British vessels. ''Bellerophon'' had suffered grievously, losing 27 dead and 127 wounded.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Although ''Aigle'' was lost in the chaotic storm which followed the battle, ''Bellerophon'' survived, primarily due to Cumby's leadership. He was later promoted to post captain for his services in the action.{{r|\"CW:52\"}} Cooke's body was [[buried at sea]] the day after the battle with the other fatal casualties from ''Bellerophon''.{{r|\"ODNB\"}}\n\n==Family and legacy==\n[[File:Tomb of Horatio Nelson on Saint-Paul Cathedral.jpg|thumb|Tribute to Cooke on left in the crypt of St Pauls Cathedral]]\n[[File:St Andrew's Church, Donhead St Andrew 16.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Memorial to Cooke in St{{nbsp}}Andrew's Church, Donhead St{{nbsp}}Andrew, in Wiltshire]]\nCooke's death, as with those of [[George Duff]] and Admiral Nelson himself, was widely mourned in Britain. Cooke's widow Louisa and their eight-year-old daughter, Louisa Charlotte, were given numerous awards and presents, including the gold medal minted for the captains who had fought at the action, and a large silver vase presented by [[Lloyd's Patriotic Fund]]. At least some of the money the family received was spent on a large wall plaque mounted in St Andrew's Church in [[Donhead St Andrew]] in [[Wiltshire]], close to the family home.{{r|\"CW:49\"}} The plaque commemorates Cooke's life and death and also that of his wife. A memorial was also raised to him in [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Tributes from fellow officers were also forthcoming, including from the future explorer [[John Franklin]], who had served on ''Bellerophon'' at Trafalgar and had said of Cooke that he was \"very gentlemanly and active. I like his appearance very much.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}} A number of letters that Cooke wrote to his brother prior to Trafalgar are held by the [[National Maritime Museum]].{{r|\"National Archives\"}}\n\nCooke had married Louisa, n\u00e9e Hardy, on 15 June 1790 at [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch]]. Louisa was the fourth daughter of [[Josiah Hardy]], the former Governor of New Jersey, and later consul at Cadiz.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa died at [[Cheltenham]] on 5 February 1853 aged 96. Louisa Charlotte Cooke, their only child, was born on 26 January 1797 at [[Stoke Damerel]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa Charlotte married Abraham John Newenham Devonsher of Kilshanick, County Cork, at Cheltenham, on 9 March 1820.{{r|LCC:Marriage}} She died after a short illness at St. Anne\u2019s, Cheltenham, on 30 April 1871.{{r|LCC:Death}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}} A number of sources, including T.

21 October 1805) was an experienced and highly regarded officer of the [[Royal Navy]] during the [[American War of Independence]], the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and the first years of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Cooke is best known for his death in hand-to-hand combat with French forces during the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. During the action, his ship {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} was badly damaged and boarded by sailors and marines from the French [[ship of the line]] {{Ship|French ship|Aigle|1800|2}}. Cooke was killed in the ensuing melee, but his crew successfully drove off their opponents and ultimately forced the surrender of ''Aigle''.\n\nAside from his death, remarkably little is known of Cooke's circumstances, as unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well respected in his profession and following his death was the subject of tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and his local church in [[Wiltshire]].\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Cooke was baptised on 5 March 1762 at [[St. Mary, Whitechapel]], the second son of Francis Cooke, an [[Admiralty]] clerk, and his wife Margaret.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{Ref label|A|a|none}} John Cooke first went to sea at the age of eleven aboard the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] {{HMS|Greyhound|1763|6}} under Lieutenant [[John Bazely]], before going ashore to spend time at Mr Braken's naval academy at [[Greenwich]]. He was entered onto the books of one of the [[royal yacht]]s by [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Sir Alexander Hood]], who would become an enduring patron of Cooke's.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} In 1776 he obtained a position as a [[midshipman]] on the [[ship of the line]] {{HMS|Eagle|1774|6}}, aged thirteen.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Cooke served aboard ''Eagle'', the flagship of the [[North American Station]], during the next three years, seeing extensive action along the eastern seaboard. Notable among these actions were the naval operations around the [[Battle of Rhode Island]] in 1778, when ''Eagle'' was closely engaged with American units ashore.{{r|\"ODNB\"}} He distinguished himself in the assault, causing Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] to remark \"Why, young man, you wish to become a Lieutenant before you are of sufficient age.\"{{r|\"NT:95\"}} On 21 January 1779, Cooke was promoted to [[lieutenant]] and joined {{HMS|Superb|1760|6}} in the East Indies under [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]], but was forced to take a leave of absence due to ill-health.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\nCooke returned to England and then went to France to spend a year studying, before rejoining the navy in 1782 with an appointment to the 90-gun {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} under Captain [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Alan Gardner]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Cooke saw action at the [[Battle of the Saintes]], at which ''Duke'' was heavily engaged. He remained with Gardner following the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, bringing an end to the American War of Independence, and served as his first-lieutenant aboard his next command, the 50-gun {{HMS|Europa|1783|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Gardner became commodore at [[Jamaica]], flying his [[broad pennant]] aboard ''Europa'' and retaining Cooke as his first-lieutenant until Cooke was injured in a bad fall and had to be invalided home.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} He had recovered sufficiently by the time of the [[Spanish Armament]] in 1790 to be able to take up an appointment from his old patron, Sir Alexander Hood, to be third-lieutenant of his flagship, the 90-gun {{HMS|London|1766|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{r|\"ODNB\"}} When the crisis passed without breaking into open war, ''London'' was paid off and Cooke went ashore.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\n==Frigate command==\nWith the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in February 1793, Cooke rejoined Hood and became first-lieutenant of his new flagship, the 100-gun {{HMS|Royal George|1788|6}}, part of the [[Channel Fleet]]. On 21 February 1794, Cooke was promoted to [[commander]] and given his first independent command, the small [[fireship]] {{HMS|Incendiary|1782|6}}. Three months later, ''Incendiary'' was a signal repeater for the Channel Fleet during the [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794]], relaying [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe's]] signals to the fleet and operating as a scout in the search for the French fleet under [[Villaret de Joyeuse]]. On 1 June 1794, Cooke was a witness to the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], although his tiny ship was far too small to engage in combat.{{r|\"JW1:126\"}} In the action's aftermath, Cooke was included in the general promotions issued to the fleet, becoming a [[post captain]] on 23 July 1794. For a year, Cooke was stationed off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] as [[flag captain]] to [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] aboard the 74-gun {{HMS|Monarch|1765|6}}, before returning to Britain and being offered command of the 28-gun {{HMS|Tourterelle|1795|6}}.{{r|\"NT:96\"}} Cooke accepted, but when he found out she was ordered to the West Indies, he resigned it, having been told by Gardner that further service in the West Indies would likely kill him.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nInstead in early 1796 he took command of the 36-gun [[frigate]] {{HMS|Nymphe|1780|6}}. ''Nymphe'' was employed in the blockade of the French Atlantic ports over the next year, and on 9 March 1797 was in company with {{HMS|St Fiorenzo|1794|6}} when they encountered the returning ships of a short-lived [[Battle of Fishguard|French invasion attempt]] of Britain that had been defeated at [[Fishguard]] in [[Wales]].{{r|\"JW2:80\"}} The French ships attempted to escape into [[Brest, France|Brest]], but were hunted down by the British, who forced the surrender of [[French ship R\u00e9sistance|''R\u00e9sistance'']] and [[French ship Constance|''Constance'']] in turn after successive short engagements.{{r|\"JH:45\"}} Neither of the British ships suffered a single casualty in the combat, and both French ships were subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy, bringing [[prize money]] to Cooke and his crew.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=14035|page=764|date=8 August 1797}}</ref>\n\nDespite this success, Cooke was unpopular with his men due to the strict discipline he enforced aboard his ship. This was graphically demonstrated just two months after the action off Brest, when ''Nymphe'' became embroiled in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Spithead mutiny]]. Cooke attempted to assist Admiral [[John Colpoys]] at the mutiny's outbreak, and was ordered ashore by his crew when he tried to return to his ship. Cooke was tactfully removed from command by the Admiralty following the mutiny, although he was returned to service two years later aboard the new frigate {{HMS|Amethyst|1799|6}} in preparation for the Anglo-Russian invasion of the [[Batavian Republic]].{{r|\"CW:48\"}} During the invasion, ''Amethyst'' conveyed the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] to the Netherlands and later participated in the evacuation of the force following the campaign's collapse.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nCooke was involved in operations in [[Quiberon Bay]] during the remainder of 1799, and in 1800 participated in an abortive invasion of [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]]. During this time, ''Amethyst'' captured six French merchant ships and small privateers.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15301|page=1176|date=11 October 1800}}</ref> During 1801, Cooke participated in the capture of the {{Ship|French frigate|D\u00e9daigneuse|1797|2|up=yes}} off [[Cape Finisterre]], helping [[Samuel Hood Linzee]] and [[Sir Richard King, 2nd Baronet|Richard King]] chase her down on 26 January. ''Amethyst'' was not heavily engaged with ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' and received no damage, but aided in pursuing and trapping the French ship so that she could be seized. ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' was later purchased into the Royal Navy as HMS ''Dedaigneuse''.{{r|\"JW3:136\"}} Shortly afterwards, Cooke captured the Spanish ship ''Carlotta'' and the French [[privateer]] ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Brune'' in the same area.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15412|page=1203|date=29 September 1801}}</ref>\n\n==Trafalgar==\n[[File:Trafalgar aufstellung.jpg|thumb|Battle of Trafalgar]]\nWith the [[Peace of Amiens]], Cooke briefly retired on half-pay before being recalled to the fleet at the outbreak of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1803. Cooke was requested as flag captain by Admiral [[William Young (1751\u20131821)|Sir William Young]] at [[Plymouth]], but Cooke tactfully refused, instead applying for active service. He received command of {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} on 25 April 1805. In May, after the large combined French and Spanish fleet, under Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] escaped from [[Toulon]], beginning the [[Trafalgar Campaign]], Cooke was ordered to join a flying squadron under Vice-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]]. The squadron arrived off [[Cadiz]] on 9 June and Collingwood detached ''Bellerophon'' and three other ships to blockade [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Richard Bickerton, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Bickerton]]. When the combined fleet entered Cadiz on 20 August, Collingwood recalled Bickerton's force and mounted a blockade of the port. Collingwood was reinforced with more ships, and was later superseded by Nelson. Cooke was heard to say at this time that \"To be in a general engagement with [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] would crown all my military ambition\".{{r|\"ODNB\"}} Nelson had Villeneuve's fleet trapped in Cadiz and was blockading the harbour awaiting their expected attempt to escape.\n\nThe Franco-Spanish fleet escaped Cadiz on 18 October 1805, but was soon chased down by Nelson and brought to battle on 21 October. Nelson formed his fleet into two divisions; the weather column would attack to the north under his direct command and the lee column would operate to the south under the command of Cuthbert Collingwood in {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1786|6}}. Cooke was stationed fifth in Collingwood's line, and so was one of the first ships engaged in action with the combined fleet. Cooke took the unusual step of informing his first lieutenant [[William Pryce Cumby]] and his master Edward Overton of Nelson's orders, in case he should be killed.{{r|\"CW:47\"}}\n\n''Bellerophon'' was soon closely engaged with the French, breaking through the enemy line and closing with [[French ship Aigle (1800)|''Aigle'']]. As with the other French ships in the fleet, ''Aigle's'' rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on ''Bellerophon'' and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was still wearing his uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied \"It is too late to take them off. I see my situation, but I will die like a man\".{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n[[File:Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Coloured print of a naval battle between sailing ships. Four ships seen stern on in the right of the picture, obscured by clouds of smoke, a fifth ship seen bow on in the left.|''Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke'', early-nineteenth century aquatint by [[Thomas Whitcombe]], showing the ''Bellerophon'' surrounded by enemy ships at the moment of Cooke's death]]\nAs the action continued, the Captain Pierre-Paul Gour\u00e8ge of ''Aigle'' ordered his crew to board and seize ''Bellerophon'', hoping to use their superiority of numbers to overwhelm the British crew. Cooke sent Cumby below to make sure that the lower-deck guns continued to fire into the French ship as the battle continued overhead, and threw himself at the French sailors pouring onto ''Bellerophon's'' quarterdeck, shooting an enemy officer dead and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the men behind him.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Within minutes Cumby had returned to the deck with reinforcements from below, passing the mortally wounded Overton on the ladder. The badly wounded ship's quartermaster was also present, and he informed Cumby that Cooke had fallen in the melee.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Cumby's charge cleared the French from the deck of ''Bellerophon'', and he found Cooke dead on the quarterdeck, two [[musket]] balls lodged in his chest. Cooke's last words had been \"Let me lie quietly a minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n\nCumby took charge of the battered ''Bellerophon'', directing her fire into ''Aigle'' and ultimately forcing the French ship's surrender after the arrival of other British vessels. ''Bellerophon'' had suffered grievously, losing 27 dead and 127 wounded.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Although ''Aigle'' was lost in the chaotic storm which followed the battle, ''Bellerophon'' survived, primarily due to Cumby's leadership. He was later promoted to post captain for his services in the action.{{r|\"CW:52\"}} Cooke's body was [[buried at sea]] the day after the battle with the other fatal casualties from ''Bellerophon''.{{r|\"ODNB\"}}\n\n==Family and legacy==\n[[File:Tomb of Horatio Nelson on Saint-Paul Cathedral.jpg|thumb|Tribute to Cooke on left in the crypt of St Pauls Cathedral]]\n[[File:St Andrew's Church, Donhead St Andrew 16.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Memorial to Cooke in St{{nbsp}}Andrew's Church, Donhead St{{nbsp}}Andrew, in Wiltshire]]\nCooke's death, as with those of [[George Duff]] and Admiral Nelson himself, was widely mourned in Britain. Cooke's widow Louisa and their eight-year-old daughter, Louisa Charlotte, were given numerous awards and presents, including the gold medal minted for the captains who had fought at the action, and a large silver vase presented by [[Lloyd's Patriotic Fund]]. At least some of the money the family received was spent on a large wall plaque mounted in St Andrew's Church in [[Donhead St Andrew]] in [[Wiltshire]], close to the family home.{{r|\"CW:49\"}} The plaque commemorates Cooke's life and death and also that of his wife. A memorial was also raised to him in [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Tributes from fellow officers were also forthcoming, including from the future explorer [[John Franklin]], who had served on ''Bellerophon'' at Trafalgar and had said of Cooke that he was \"very gentlemanly and active. I like his appearance very much.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}} A number of letters that Cooke wrote to his brother prior to Trafalgar are held by the [[National Maritime Museum]].{{r|\"National Archives\"}}\n\nCooke had married Louisa, n\u00e9e Hardy, on 15 June 1790 at [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch]]. Louisa was the fourth daughter of [[Josiah Hardy]], the former Governor of New Jersey, and later consul at Cadiz.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa died at [[Cheltenham]] on 5 February 1853 aged 96. Louisa Charlotte Cooke, their only child, was born on 26 January 1797 at [[Stoke Damerel]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa Charlotte married Abraham John Newenham Devonsher of Kilshanick, County Cork, at Cheltenham, on 9 March 1820.{{r|LCC:Marriage}} She died after a short illness at St. Anne\u2019s, Cheltenham, on 30 April 1871.{{r|LCC:Death}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}} A number of sources, including T.

In other words, sex-limited genes cause the two sexes to show different [[Trait (biology)|traits]] or [[phenotype]]s, despite having the same [[genotype]]. This term is restricted to [[autosomal]] traits, and should not be confused with [[sex-linked]] characteristics, which have to do with genetic differences on the sex chromosomes (see [[sex-determination system]]). Sex-limited genes are also distinguished from [http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/sex-influenced sex-influenced] genes, where the same gene will show differential expression in each sex. Sex-influenced genes commonly show a dominant/recessive relationship, where the same gene will have a dominant effect in one sex and a recessive effect in the other (for example, [[male pattern baldness]]).\n\nSex-limited genes are responsible for  [[sexual dimorphism]], which is a phenotypic (directly observable) difference between males and females of the same species.

In fact, these genes try to resolve the \"push-pull\" between males and females over trait values for optimal phenotype. Without these genes, organisms would be forced to settle on an ''average ''trait value, incurring costs on both sexes. With these genes, it is possible to 'turn off' the [[genes]] in one sex, allowing both sexes to attain (or at least, approach very closely) their optimal phenotypes.\n\n== A brief history ==\nThe idea of sex-limited genes was initially developed by [[Charles Darwin]] in 1871 in his book ''The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex.''<ref>{{cite book|last=Darwin|first=Charles|title=The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex|year=1871|publisher=[[A. L. Burt]]|location=New York}}</ref> He did not distinguish between sex-limited, sex-linked, and sex-influenced genes, but referred to any gene that expresses differently between sexes as sex-limited. While this concept was still in its infancy, Darwin catalyzed the further development of sex-related selection. [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]], aware of this confusing terminology, published an article in ''The American Naturalist ''in 1914 titled \"Sex-Linked and Sex-Limited Inheritance,\" which proposed definitions of sex-linked genes and sex-limited genes (as defined in the introduction above).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|first=Thomas Hunt|title=Sex-Limited and Sex-Linked Inheritance|journal=The American Naturalist|date=October 1914|volume=48|issue=574|pages=577\u2013583|doi=10.1086/279432}}</ref>  Morgan's paper was followed by several others involving sex-limited genes and their expression as traits. One of the more notable example is John H. Gerould's \"Inheritance of White Wing Color, a Sex-Limited (Sex-Controlled) Variation in Yellow Pierid Butterflies,\" published in ''Genetics ''in 1923 (and edited slightly in 1924).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gerould|first=John H.|title=Inheritance of White Wing Color, a Sex-Limited (Sex-Controlled) Variation in Yellow Pierid Butterflies|journal=Genetics|date=November 1923|volume=8|issue=6|pages=495\u2013551|pmid=17246025|pmc=1200764}}</ref> Gerould observed the phenotypic differences between male and female Pierid Butterflies and determined colouration to be a sex-limited trait. \n\nTo conclude the notable advancements in the early stages of the development of sex-limited genes, a brief discussion of [[R. A. Fisher]] is necessary. Commonly hailed as one of the best evolutionary biologists of his time, Fisher was also a talented geneticist. His book ''The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection'', published in 1930, over 20 years before the double-helix shape of DNA was discovered, was the first attempt to explain Darwin's theories within the foundation of [[genetics]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Fisher|first=R. A.|title=The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.221869|year=1930|publisher=Clarendon|location=Oxford}}</ref>  Chapter 6 of this book is titled \"Sexual Reproduction and Sexual Selection\" and includes a genetic interpretation of Darwin's initial idea of sex-limited genes. After these groundbreaking works, papers continue to be published further exploring the causes, mechanisms, evolutionary advantages, and more of sex-limited genes.\n\n== Genetics ==\n\nThe genetic study of sexual dimorphism, published in ''Evolution'', hypotheses two methods which leads to different ornamental characteristics in male and female birds. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Coyne|first=Jerry|author2=Emily H. Kay |author3=Stephen Pruett-Jones |title=The Genetic Basis of Sexual Dimorphism in Birds|journal=Evolution|year=2007|volume=61|issue=1|pages=214\u2013219|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00254.x|pmid=18005159}}</ref> The [[alleles]] (different versions of the same gene) responsible for sexual dimorphism can be limited to expression in only one sex when they first appear, or the alleles could begin by being expressed in both sexes then become modified (repressed or promoted) in one sex by modifier genes or regulatory elements. The concept of this study was to examine female [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] from species where males displayed different types of ornamental traits (elongated feathers, wattles, color patches). The assumption is that different hypotheses about male-specific expression will yield different results in female hybrids. The methods and materials of the experiment are discussed in detail in the paper, but the important result that emerged was that NO female hybrids expressed any of the ornamental traits found in the parent males. Two interpretations of these results are possible: the dimorphic alleles were initially only expressed in males, or the alleles were initially expressed in both and then were suppressed in females or became limited to males by regulatory regions that are ''completely dominant'' in hybrids. The most likely genomic explanation for initial expression in both species then modification is involvement of ''cis''-dominance, where the factors that modify the gene are located next to the gene on the [[chromosome]]. (This is in contrast to ''trans''-dominance, where mobile products that can affect distant genes are produced.) These factors can be in the form of [[Promoter regions (genetics)|promoter regions]], which can be either suppressed or activated by [[hormones]]. This experiment also demonstrates that these alleles come under regulatory control very quickly. This is because none of the ornamentation seen in males is seen in the ''very next ''generation. These conclusions make it likely that at least some male-specific (thus, sex-limited) genes cue their expression by hormone levels, such as threshold ratios of estrogen and testosterone.\n\n== Fitness consequences ==\n\n===Storage effect===\nBecause sex-limited genes are present in both sexes but only expressed in one, this allows the unexpressed genes to be hidden from selection. On a short-term scale, this means that during one generation, only the sex that expresses the sex-limited trait(s) of interest will be affected by selection. The remaining half of the gene pool for these traits will be unaffected by selection because they are hidden (unexpressed) in the genes of the other sex. Since a portion of the alleles for these sex-limited traits are hidden from selection, this occurrence has been termed 'storage-effect'. On a long-term scale, this storage effect can have significant effects on selection, especially if selection is fluctuating over a long period of time. It is inarguable that selection will fluctuate over time with varying levels of environmental stability. For example, fluctuations in population density can drive selection on sex-limited traits. In less dense populations, females will have less opportunity to choose between males for reproduction. In this case, attractive males may experience both reduced reproductive success and increased predation pressure. Thus, selection on males for sex-limited traits such as increased size (elephant seals) and weaponry (claws on fiddler crabs, horns on rhinoceros beetles) will change direction with fluctuation in population density.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Reinhold|first=K|title=Evolutionary Genetics Of Sex-Limited Traits Under Fluctuating Selection|journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology|year=1999|volume=12|issue=5|pages=897\u2013902|doi=10.1046/j.1420-9101.1999.00092.x}}</ref>\n\n===Rapid evolution===\nJohn Parsch and Hans Ellegren defined \"genes that differ in expression between females and males\" as sex-biased genes. While this definition is more broad, sex-limited genes are certainly included in this category. One of the key principles of sex-biased gene expression that Parsch and Ellegren stressed in their paper in February 2013<ref>{{cite journal|last=Parsch|first=J|author2=Ellegren, H |title=The Evolutionary Causes and Consequences of Sex-Biased Gene Expression|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|year=2013|volume=14|issue=2|pages=83\u201387|doi=10.1038/nrg3376|pmid=23329110}}</ref> is that of rapid evolution. They assert that a gene's sex bias can vary among different types of tissues throughout the body or throughout development, making the level of sex bias a fluid, rather than static, property. This makes it possible, then, that the rapid evolution seen in sex-biased genes is not an inherent property of their sex bias, but a property of some other feature. The paper offers expression breadth, the number of tissue types in which the genes are expressed, as an example of a feature correlated to sex-biased genes. It is known that genes with limited expression (in only one type of tissue) generally evolve faster than those with a higher expression breadth, and sex-biased genes are often restricted in their expression, such as to only the testes or ovaries. Thus, it is likely that sex-biased (including sex-limited) genes will evolve faster than the average genetic information. Parsch and Ellegren also assert that \"sex-biased genes expressed only in sex-limited reproductive tissues evolve faster than unbiased genes that are expressed only in a single, non-reproductive tissue.\" That is, genes that have a bias toward any kind of reproductive tissue (testes or ovaries) seem to show faster evolution than genes expressed in non-gonadal tissues, despite the number of tissues in which they are expressed. This makes sense in the context of genes with reproductive function evolving more quickly, a generally observed pattern in [[evolutionary biology]].\n\n===Effects of sexual antagonism===\nSexual antagonism occurs when two species have conflicting optimal fitness strategies concerning reproduction (see link in introduction paragraph). Multiple matings is a classic example of competing optimal strategies. Males, who typically have a much lower overall investment in reproduction, may benefit from more frequent matings. Females, however, invest much more in reproduction and can be endangered, harmed, or even killed by multiple matings.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Reinhardt|first=Klaus|author2=Richard Naylor |author3=Michael Siva-Jothy |title=Reducing a cost of traumatic insemination: female bedbugs evolve a unique organ.|journal=Proc. R. Soc. B|date=22 November 2003|volume=270|issue=1531|pages=2371\u20132375|doi=10.1098/rspb.2003.2515|pmid=14667353|pmc=1691512}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Hosken et al. completed an important study exploring the effects of [[sexual conflict|sexually antagonistic selection]] on sex-limited trait expression.<ref name=\":0\" />  They asked if sex-specific trait selection always resolved intralocus conflict, as it was believed to do. By using a species of flour beetle, ''Gnatocerus cornutus'', exhibiting sex-limited traits in the form of exaggerated [[Mandible (arthropod mouthpart)|mandible]] size, they were able to test this hypothesis. Exaggerated mandibles are ''only ''developed in males; females never develop exaggerated mandibles. The point of this experiment was to determine how mandibles affect fitness. If these sex-limited genes are truly quelling intralocus sexual conflict, male mandible size should have no effect on female fitness. After selecting for males with exaggerated mandibles (full materials and methods can be found within the paper), it was experimentally determined that males with exaggerated mandibles had a higher fitness - they experienced increased fighting and mating success. It was also found, however, that females found in the populations of males with exaggerated mandibles had lower fitness (as determined by lifetime reproductive success, LRS) relative to the fitness of females in populations with males with smaller mandibles. Since this male sex-limited trait affects female fitness, intralocus sexual conflict has ''not ''been resolved. This highlights the importance of sexual conflict to [[evolution]], because it cannot simply be defused by sex-limited trait expression.\n\nLater the same year, a paper in ''Evolution ''also came to the same conclusions about sexual antagonism in relation to sex-limited genes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Connallon|first=Tim|author2=Robert M. Cox |author3=Ryan Calsbeek |title=Fitness Consequences of Sex-Specific Selection|journal=Evolution|year=2010|volume=64|issue=6|pages=1671\u20131682|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00934.x|pmid=20050912|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/78600/1/j.1558-5646.2009.00934.x.pdf}}</ref> They developed a mathematical model to show that the fitness costs of sexual antagonism, even when rare, will usually overwhelm the benefits of sexually concordant selection. (Sexually concordant selection occurs when selection favors the same alleles in both sexes but differs in relative strength between them.) Through several advanced calculations, they concluded that even a small relative amount of sexual antagonism will overwhelm any benefit harvested from sexually concordant selection. Coming to the same conclusion as Hosken et al., they demonstrated mathematically that when sex-limited gene expression attempts to resolve sexual antagonism, it is likely to produce negative long-term fitness consequences. This result is seen in the experiment with beetles above, where the females demonstrate reduced fitness in response to males selected for larger mandibles. So, with mathematical support and a lack of support for strong fitness benefits as a result of sexually concordant selection, the paper concludes that sex-specific selection is more likely to incur costs than benefits to sexually reproducing species.\n\n=== Effects on animal behavior  ===\nAnimal behavior (see [[ethology]]) encompasses so many disciplines that it is impossible not to see it in some capacity in almost all primary literature involving live animals. While the examples above certainly contain aspects of animal behavior, a more overt example of it in relation to sex-limited traits is detailed in a Teplitsky et al. paper (2010) centering on breeding time in red-billed gulls.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal|last=Teplitsky|first=C|author2=JA Mills |author3=JW Yarrall |author4=J Merila |title=Indirect genetic effects in a sex-limited trait: the case of breeding time in red-billed gulls|journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology|year=2010|volume=23|issue=5|pages=935\u2013944|doi=10.1111/j.1420-9101.2010.01959.x|pmid=20345824}}</ref> This experiment deals with breeding time, an aspect of reproductive biology. Reproduction and sexual behavior are two key aspects of animal behavior, as they are universally expressed in some way throughout the animal kingdom.\n\nBreeding time in red-billed gulls  is expressed only in females, because only females lay eggs. Male care, however, affects female breeding performance substantially. This qualifies breeding time as a sex-limited trait because it is expressed only in one sex but can be affected by both (similarly to Hosken's beetle experiment above). By following a natural population of red-billed gulls for 46 years, Teplitsky et al. came to an unexpected conclusion - while laying date (aka breeding time) is only expressed in females, the trait is only heritable in males. This is atypical because sex-limited traits are almost always heritable within the sex in which they are expressed.\n\nFor this species, the timing of egg-laying has much to do with male behavior. Males can affect female reproductive success so strongly because for the 20 days up to egg-laying, females spend up to 80% of their time in the nest. This leaves males with the responsibility of providing food regularly and securing (and maintaining) a high-quality territory for nesting. This phenomenon of the genetics of one individual affecting those of another individual is known as ''indirect genetic effects''. For this population, at least, possible explanations for this atypical heritability pattern exist. While controlling female health and safety, males are responsible for the timing of the start of courtship feeding, as well. These populations also typically have excesses of females, allowing males to exert even further choice in the form of mate choice. These factors in combination give males a great opportunity to express their \"laying date genotype\". In spite of the presence of directional selection and significant male heritability for breeding time, no advancement of breeding time was seen during the 46 years of this experiment. This does not discount the significance of the paper's other results however - one of the most significant being that here a \"female trait (laying date) is largely determined by genetic characteristics of its mate\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Epigenetics==\n[[Epigenetics]] is the study of heritable phenotype changes, caused by modification of gene expression and does not entail a change in the genetic code. These epigenetic factors may also be sex-limited. [[Genomic imprinting]] for example, silencing of one parental allele by [[DNA methylation]], for which sex-limited imprinting has been proposed to resolve [[Intralocus sexual conflict|intralocus conflict]]. Genomic imprinting has been shown to be indistinguishable from non-imprinted systems at the [[Population genetics|population]] level in some cases, having equivalent evolutionary models. However, this does not hold for sex-limited models of sex-limited imprinting which behave differently depending on which sex imprinting occurs and the parental sex of imprinted allele. Specifically, this affects whether alleles are imprinted in consecutive generations with different evolutionary trajectories (under the same selection fitnesses) arising purely due to sex-limited epigenetics. The X chromosome for example, has been very prevalent in the field of epigenetics. The X chromosome percentage between males and females is largely due to X chromosome inactivation. In humans, the process of X chromosome inactivation occurs in the beginning stages of development which is one of the main reasons why this topic has been challenging to study. In differentiating between the XX and the XY chromosomes, the amount of X-linked genes compared to XY males are due to the silencing of one of the two chromosomes in XX female. RNA X inactive specific transcript (Xist) regulates this whole process which results in a genome wide silencing. This is also a concept that is poorly understood which makes for great study and prolonged analysis. Indeed, over 20% of X-linked genes are expressed from the inactive X chromosome and they contribute to sexually dimorphic traits. The X chromosome makes a very small percentage of the total human genome and the epigenetics of this chromosome is a major contributor to certain diseases. Thus sex-limited epigenetic traits may have played a pivotal role in the evolution of mammals and other species, particularly as a mechanism to ameliorate intralocus conflict between the sexes.\n\n==Conclusions==\nOverall, sex-limited genes carry with them several complex cost to benefit ratios which call for further analysis. For example, while they allow for greater opportunities of sexual dimorphism so both sexes can reach much closer to their optimal phenotypes, they also incur fitness costs on sexually reproducing species. Since Charles Darwin's revolutionary book was published in 1871, there have been many studies done on the nature of these genes. The scientific literature dealing with the concepts of sexual dimorphism and sex-limited genes extends far past what has been listed here. The genetic and mechanistic details of these genes are still being discovered through ongoing research today. It is becoming apparent that a deeper understanding sex-limited genes will be increasingly important as the fields of evolutionary biology and genetics advance.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F937.1&viewtype=text&pageseq=1/ The Complete Works of Charles Darwin Online]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150915152212/http://ead.dartmouth.edu/html/ms1040.html Guide to the Papers of John H.

In fact, these genes try to resolve the \"push-pull\" between males and females over trait values for optimal phenotype. Without these genes, organisms would be forced to settle on an ''average ''trait value, incurring costs on both sexes. With these genes, it is possible to 'turn off' the [[genes]] in one sex, allowing both sexes to attain (or at least, approach very closely) their optimal phenotypes.\n\n== A brief history ==\nThe idea of sex-limited genes was initially developed by [[Charles Darwin]] in 1871 in his book ''The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex.''<ref>{{cite book|last=Darwin|first=Charles|title=The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex|year=1871|publisher=[[A. L. Burt]]|location=New York}}</ref> He did not distinguish between sex-limited, sex-linked, and sex-influenced genes, but referred to any gene that expresses differently between sexes as sex-limited. While this concept was still in its infancy, Darwin catalyzed the further development of sex-related selection. [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]], aware of this confusing terminology, published an article in ''The American Naturalist ''in 1914 titled \"Sex-Linked and Sex-Limited Inheritance,\" which proposed definitions of sex-linked genes and sex-limited genes (as defined in the introduction above).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|first=Thomas Hunt|title=Sex-Limited and Sex-Linked Inheritance|journal=The American Naturalist|date=October 1914|volume=48|issue=574|pages=577\u2013583|doi=10.1086/279432}}</ref>  Morgan's paper was followed by several others involving sex-limited genes and their expression as traits. One of the more notable example is John H. Gerould's \"Inheritance of White Wing Color, a Sex-Limited (Sex-Controlled) Variation in Yellow Pierid Butterflies,\" published in ''Genetics ''in 1923 (and edited slightly in 1924).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gerould|first=John H.|title=Inheritance of White Wing Color, a Sex-Limited (Sex-Controlled) Variation in Yellow Pierid Butterflies|journal=Genetics|date=November 1923|volume=8|issue=6|pages=495\u2013551|pmid=17246025|pmc=1200764}}</ref> Gerould observed the phenotypic differences between male and female Pierid Butterflies and determined colouration to be a sex-limited trait. \n\nTo conclude the notable advancements in the early stages of the development of sex-limited genes, a brief discussion of [[R. A. Fisher]] is necessary. Commonly hailed as one of the best evolutionary biologists of his time, Fisher was also a talented geneticist. His book ''The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection'', published in 1930, over 20 years before the double-helix shape of DNA was discovered, was the first attempt to explain Darwin's theories within the foundation of [[genetics]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Fisher|first=R. A.|title=The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.221869|year=1930|publisher=Clarendon|location=Oxford}}</ref>  Chapter 6 of this book is titled \"Sexual Reproduction and Sexual Selection\" and includes a genetic interpretation of Darwin's initial idea of sex-limited genes. After these groundbreaking works, papers continue to be published further exploring the causes, mechanisms, evolutionary advantages, and more of sex-limited genes.\n\n== Genetics ==\n\nThe genetic study of sexual dimorphism, published in ''Evolution'', hypotheses two methods which leads to different ornamental characteristics in male and female birds. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Coyne|first=Jerry|author2=Emily H. Kay |author3=Stephen Pruett-Jones |title=The Genetic Basis of Sexual Dimorphism in Birds|journal=Evolution|year=2007|volume=61|issue=1|pages=214\u2013219|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00254.x|pmid=18005159}}</ref> The [[alleles]] (different versions of the same gene) responsible for sexual dimorphism can be limited to expression in only one sex when they first appear, or the alleles could begin by being expressed in both sexes then become modified (repressed or promoted) in one sex by modifier genes or regulatory elements. The concept of this study was to examine female [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] from species where males displayed different types of ornamental traits (elongated feathers, wattles, color patches). The assumption is that different hypotheses about male-specific expression will yield different results in female hybrids. The methods and materials of the experiment are discussed in detail in the paper, but the important result that emerged was that NO female hybrids expressed any of the ornamental traits found in the parent males. Two interpretations of these results are possible: the dimorphic alleles were initially only expressed in males, or the alleles were initially expressed in both and then were suppressed in females or became limited to males by regulatory regions that are ''completely dominant'' in hybrids. The most likely genomic explanation for initial expression in both species then modification is involvement of ''cis''-dominance, where the factors that modify the gene are located next to the gene on the [[chromosome]]. (This is in contrast to ''trans''-dominance, where mobile products that can affect distant genes are produced.) These factors can be in the form of [[Promoter regions (genetics)|promoter regions]], which can be either suppressed or activated by [[hormones]]. This experiment also demonstrates that these alleles come under regulatory control very quickly. This is because none of the ornamentation seen in males is seen in the ''very next ''generation. These conclusions make it likely that at least some male-specific (thus, sex-limited) genes cue their expression by hormone levels, such as threshold ratios of estrogen and testosterone.\n\n== Fitness consequences ==\n\n===Storage effect===\nBecause sex-limited genes are present in both sexes but only expressed in one, this allows the unexpressed genes to be hidden from selection. On a short-term scale, this means that during one generation, only the sex that expresses the sex-limited trait(s) of interest will be affected by selection. The remaining half of the gene pool for these traits will be unaffected by selection because they are hidden (unexpressed) in the genes of the other sex. Since a portion of the alleles for these sex-limited traits are hidden from selection, this occurrence has been termed 'storage-effect'. On a long-term scale, this storage effect can have significant effects on selection, especially if selection is fluctuating over a long period of time. It is inarguable that selection will fluctuate over time with varying levels of environmental stability. For example, fluctuations in population density can drive selection on sex-limited traits. In less dense populations, females will have less opportunity to choose between males for reproduction. In this case, attractive males may experience both reduced reproductive success and increased predation pressure. Thus, selection on males for sex-limited traits such as increased size (elephant seals) and weaponry (claws on fiddler crabs, horns on rhinoceros beetles) will change direction with fluctuation in population density.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Reinhold|first=K|title=Evolutionary Genetics Of Sex-Limited Traits Under Fluctuating Selection|journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology|year=1999|volume=12|issue=5|pages=897\u2013902|doi=10.1046/j.1420-9101.1999.00092.x}}</ref>\n\n===Rapid evolution===\nJohn Parsch and Hans Ellegren defined \"genes that differ in expression between females and males\" as sex-biased genes. While this definition is more broad, sex-limited genes are certainly included in this category. One of the key principles of sex-biased gene expression that Parsch and Ellegren stressed in their paper in February 2013<ref>{{cite journal|last=Parsch|first=J|author2=Ellegren, H |title=The Evolutionary Causes and Consequences of Sex-Biased Gene Expression|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|year=2013|volume=14|issue=2|pages=83\u201387|doi=10.1038/nrg3376|pmid=23329110}}</ref> is that of rapid evolution. They assert that a gene's sex bias can vary among different types of tissues throughout the body or throughout development, making the level of sex bias a fluid, rather than static, property. This makes it possible, then, that the rapid evolution seen in sex-biased genes is not an inherent property of their sex bias, but a property of some other feature. The paper offers expression breadth, the number of tissue types in which the genes are expressed, as an example of a feature correlated to sex-biased genes. It is known that genes with limited expression (in only one type of tissue) generally evolve faster than those with a higher expression breadth, and sex-biased genes are often restricted in their expression, such as to only the testes or ovaries. Thus, it is likely that sex-biased (including sex-limited) genes will evolve faster than the average genetic information. Parsch and Ellegren also assert that \"sex-biased genes expressed only in sex-limited reproductive tissues evolve faster than unbiased genes that are expressed only in a single, non-reproductive tissue.\" That is, genes that have a bias toward any kind of reproductive tissue (testes or ovaries) seem to show faster evolution than genes expressed in non-gonadal tissues, despite the number of tissues in which they are expressed. This makes sense in the context of genes with reproductive function evolving more quickly, a generally observed pattern in [[evolutionary biology]].\n\n===Effects of sexual antagonism===\nSexual antagonism occurs when two species have conflicting optimal fitness strategies concerning reproduction (see link in introduction paragraph). Multiple matings is a classic example of competing optimal strategies. Males, who typically have a much lower overall investment in reproduction, may benefit from more frequent matings. Females, however, invest much more in reproduction and can be endangered, harmed, or even killed by multiple matings.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Reinhardt|first=Klaus|author2=Richard Naylor |author3=Michael Siva-Jothy |title=Reducing a cost of traumatic insemination: female bedbugs evolve a unique organ.|journal=Proc. R. Soc. B|date=22 November 2003|volume=270|issue=1531|pages=2371\u20132375|doi=10.1098/rspb.2003.2515|pmid=14667353|pmc=1691512}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Hosken et al. completed an important study exploring the effects of [[sexual conflict|sexually antagonistic selection]] on sex-limited trait expression.<ref name=\":0\" />  They asked if sex-specific trait selection always resolved intralocus conflict, as it was believed to do. By using a species of flour beetle, ''Gnatocerus cornutus'', exhibiting sex-limited traits in the form of exaggerated [[Mandible (arthropod mouthpart)|mandible]] size, they were able to test this hypothesis. Exaggerated mandibles are ''only ''developed in males; females never develop exaggerated mandibles. The point of this experiment was to determine how mandibles affect fitness. If these sex-limited genes are truly quelling intralocus sexual conflict, male mandible size should have no effect on female fitness. After selecting for males with exaggerated mandibles (full materials and methods can be found within the paper), it was experimentally determined that males with exaggerated mandibles had a higher fitness - they experienced increased fighting and mating success. It was also found, however, that females found in the populations of males with exaggerated mandibles had lower fitness (as determined by lifetime reproductive success, LRS) relative to the fitness of females in populations with males with smaller mandibles. Since this male sex-limited trait affects female fitness, intralocus sexual conflict has ''not ''been resolved. This highlights the importance of sexual conflict to [[evolution]], because it cannot simply be defused by sex-limited trait expression.\n\nLater the same year, a paper in ''Evolution ''also came to the same conclusions about sexual antagonism in relation to sex-limited genes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Connallon|first=Tim|author2=Robert M. Cox |author3=Ryan Calsbeek |title=Fitness Consequences of Sex-Specific Selection|journal=Evolution|year=2010|volume=64|issue=6|pages=1671\u20131682|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00934.x|pmid=20050912|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/78600/1/j.1558-5646.2009.00934.x.pdf}}</ref> They developed a mathematical model to show that the fitness costs of sexual antagonism, even when rare, will usually overwhelm the benefits of sexually concordant selection. (Sexually concordant selection occurs when selection favors the same alleles in both sexes but differs in relative strength between them.) Through several advanced calculations, they concluded that even a small relative amount of sexual antagonism will overwhelm any benefit harvested from sexually concordant selection. Coming to the same conclusion as Hosken et al., they demonstrated mathematically that when sex-limited gene expression attempts to resolve sexual antagonism, it is likely to produce negative long-term fitness consequences. This result is seen in the experiment with beetles above, where the females demonstrate reduced fitness in response to males selected for larger mandibles. So, with mathematical support and a lack of support for strong fitness benefits as a result of sexually concordant selection, the paper concludes that sex-specific selection is more likely to incur costs than benefits to sexually reproducing species.\n\n=== Effects on animal behavior  ===\nAnimal behavior (see [[ethology]]) encompasses so many disciplines that it is impossible not to see it in some capacity in almost all primary literature involving live animals. While the examples above certainly contain aspects of animal behavior, a more overt example of it in relation to sex-limited traits is detailed in a Teplitsky et al. paper (2010) centering on breeding time in red-billed gulls.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal|last=Teplitsky|first=C|author2=JA Mills |author3=JW Yarrall |author4=J Merila |title=Indirect genetic effects in a sex-limited trait: the case of breeding time in red-billed gulls|journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology|year=2010|volume=23|issue=5|pages=935\u2013944|doi=10.1111/j.1420-9101.2010.01959.x|pmid=20345824}}</ref> This experiment deals with breeding time, an aspect of reproductive biology. Reproduction and sexual behavior are two key aspects of animal behavior, as they are universally expressed in some way throughout the animal kingdom.\n\nBreeding time in red-billed gulls  is expressed only in females, because only females lay eggs. Male care, however, affects female breeding performance substantially. This qualifies breeding time as a sex-limited trait because it is expressed only in one sex but can be affected by both (similarly to Hosken's beetle experiment above). By following a natural population of red-billed gulls for 46 years, Teplitsky et al. came to an unexpected conclusion - while laying date (aka breeding time) is only expressed in females, the trait is only heritable in males. This is atypical because sex-limited traits are almost always heritable within the sex in which they are expressed.\n\nFor this species, the timing of egg-laying has much to do with male behavior. Males can affect female reproductive success so strongly because for the 20 days up to egg-laying, females spend up to 80% of their time in the nest. This leaves males with the responsibility of providing food regularly and securing (and maintaining) a high-quality territory for nesting. This phenomenon of the genetics of one individual affecting those of another individual is known as ''indirect genetic effects''. For this population, at least, possible explanations for this atypical heritability pattern exist. While controlling female health and safety, males are responsible for the timing of the start of courtship feeding, as well. These populations also typically have excesses of females, allowing males to exert even further choice in the form of mate choice. These factors in combination give males a great opportunity to express their \"laying date genotype\". In spite of the presence of directional selection and significant male heritability for breeding time, no advancement of breeding time was seen during the 46 years of this experiment. This does not discount the significance of the paper's other results however - one of the most significant being that here a \"female trait (laying date) is largely determined by genetic characteristics of its mate\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Epigenetics==\n[[Epigenetics]] is the study of heritable phenotype changes, caused by modification of gene expression and does not entail a change in the genetic code. These epigenetic factors may also be sex-limited. [[Genomic imprinting]] for example, silencing of one parental allele by [[DNA methylation]], for which sex-limited imprinting has been proposed to resolve [[Intralocus sexual conflict|intralocus conflict]]. Genomic imprinting has been shown to be indistinguishable from non-imprinted systems at the [[Population genetics|population]] level in some cases, having equivalent evolutionary models. However, this does not hold for sex-limited models of sex-limited imprinting which behave differently depending on which sex imprinting occurs and the parental sex of imprinted allele. Specifically, this affects whether alleles are imprinted in consecutive generations with different evolutionary trajectories (under the same selection fitnesses) arising purely due to sex-limited epigenetics. The X chromosome for example, has been very prevalent in the field of epigenetics. The X chromosome percentage between males and females is largely due to X chromosome inactivation. In humans, the process of of X chromosome inactivation occurs in the beginning stages of development which is one of the main reasons why this topic has been challenging to study. In differentiating between the XX and the XY chromosomes, the amount of X-linked genes compared to XY males are due to the silencing of one of the two chromosomes in XX female. RNA X inactive specific transcript (Xist) regulates this whole process which results in a genome wide silencing. This is also a concept that is poorly understood which makes for great study and prolonged analysis. Indeed, over 20% of X-linked genes are expressed from the inactive X chromosome and they contribute to sexually dimorphic traits. The X chromosome makes a very small percentage of the total human genome and the epigenetics of this chromosome is a major contributor to certain diseases. Thus sex-limited epigenetic traits may have played a pivotal role in the evolution of mammals and other species, particularly as a mechanism to ameliorate intralocus conflict between the sexes.\n\n==Conclusions==\nOverall, sex-limited genes carry with them several complex cost to benefit ratios which call for further analysis. For example, while they allow for greater opportunities of sexual dimorphism so both sexes can reach much closer to their optimal phenotypes, they also incur fitness costs on sexually reproducing species. Since Charles Darwin's revolutionary book was published in 1871, there have been many studies done on the nature of these genes. The scientific literature dealing with the concepts of sexual dimorphism and sex-limited genes extends far past what has been listed here. The genetic and mechanistic details of these genes are still being discovered through ongoing research today. It is becoming apparent that a deeper understanding sex-limited genes will be increasingly important as the fields of evolutionary biology and genetics advance.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F937.1&viewtype=text&pageseq=1/ The Complete Works of Charles Darwin Online]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150915152212/http://ead.dartmouth.edu/html/ms1040.html Guide to the Papers of John H.

Instead, what makes people open their mouth are smartphones, SNS (social networking service), message boards, divination and one more thing, spoons.\n\nPeople eat where, when, with whom and how; two hungry men plan on finding people who can have dinner with them. They press your doorbell, they are just curious about your dinner, let them listen to your story and let them become your family's members. Will you open the door for them?\n\n==Format==\nThere are few parts to the show and in completing the main mission, there are rules to follow.\n\n===Rules===\nThere are no fixed rules given by production team but the cast in episode 1 had set the following rules and respected them which are as follows:\n*Press the doorbell only from 18:00 (winter) or 18:30 (summer) to 20:00.\n*Do not return a second time to the same house which had rejected them before.\n*Do not eat anything given free by citizen on road (few exceptions exist like in episode 47, the members/guests accepted grapes).\n*Do not tell any people before 18:00 that will come back later. (i.e. no pre-arranged families are allowed)\n*Can insist maximum three times if people refuse. (Original on episode 1: Do not insist if people refuse)\n*Go to another family if any family member is uncomfortable about the shooting.\n*Do not enter a family which already had dinner.\n*The above rules also apply if they discover a celebrity's residence or a celebrity as a civilian (e.g. [[Seohyun]] on ep. 121 where her family house was discovered, and her car was discovered in 2017 when she was a civilian.)\n\n===Introduction of location and guests===\nThe hosts will start from a specific place and then proceed to the neighbourhood they are tasked to have dinner. The production team will give the hosts the mission they have to complete which usually reads: \"With a spoon on hand, go to (a selected place) and request to have dinner with a family\". Some additional details may be given such as on how to get to the destination (usually by walking / public transport). They may also be given clues to find their guests at a specific location. The production team will also offer the each cast member a same amount of money for travel or snacks during the day.\n\nThe cast will then proceed to find if there are any guests which will be joining them for dinner and the guest will be introduced. The guest/s are selected by the production team to join the cast as someone whom, if they rang our doorbell, we would really want to share a meal with.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Lee Ah-young|title=['\ud55c\ub07c\uc90d\uc1fc' 1\uc8fc\ub144\u2462] CP \"\ud558\uc815\uc6b0, \uac8c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc12d\uc678 1\uc21c\uc704\u2026\ud638\uac10+\uba39\ubc29\"|url=http://www.xportsnews.com/jenter/?ac=article_view&entry_id=904425|work=Xports News|date=October 18, 2017|accessdate=April 4, 2018|language=ko}}</ref> There are some episodes which the sequence is changed (i.e. the guests are found first and introduced and then given the mission card together with the cast members).\n\nThe cast will also give a brief introduction to the location as they move through the neighbourhood which may include introducing the beautiful sceneries, the culture and how the place got its name. Some short interviews may also be conducted with local residents to understand the neighbourhood better. In addition, the cast will usually enter a realtor office to find up more about the locality and obtain useful information such as the housing types (apartments, villas, or houses) as well as demographics which may influence the success or failure of the mission. At times, some famous personalities will be mentioned having a house in the region by the realtor also.\n\nThe cast will also recce the location and may identify some houses they will like to visit later.\n\n===Completion of the main mission===\nWhen the time for ringing bells starts, the cast will then decide how to team up for the mission. If there is no guest or only one guest is there, the members do the mission together with guest. If there are two guests, they can do the mission by team (member / guest, or member / member, or guest / guest) in the same area but with different families, or together with same family.\n\nThey will then start to ring the doorbells of households. Mission is deemed to be ''success'' if before 20:00, a family (with all members allowing) permits the cast members to go inside and have dinner with the entire family, talk and then take together a family photo which will also be presented to the families afterwards. A photo of the dinner that the cast had will also be taken as proof of mission success.\n\nMission is deemed to be a failure if they fail to do so. The cast will then head to a convenience store nearby to have a dinner with a local resident who is eating dinner in the store and use the rest of the money to buy their own dinner. They will still take a picture together and share lesser stories. This is deemed to be ''partial failure''. After 21:30, if they still cannot find a resident to eat with, it will be a ''complete failure'' and the cast/guest cannot eat anything at all for the day.\n\nBefore the cast members join the dinner table of any family, there is a segment called \"Dinner Theater\" when the family's members will take their dinner as per their daily normal routine for around two or three minutes. After dinner, there is another segment called \"Compliments and Disappointments\" when the family's members tell three compliments and three disappointments about each other. In few episodes, there is also segment where video messages are sent from family members to their extended family or loved ones. At times, the cast will also provide token of appreciation to the host family. The cast will also wash the plates for the meal and share final thoughts (in the epilogue of the episode when title credits are shown).\n\n==List of episodes==\n{{Main|List of Let's Eat Dinner Together episodes}}\n\n==Ratings==\nIn the table below, {{color|blue|'''the blue numbers'''}} represent the lowest ratings and {{color|red|'''the red numbers'''}} represent the highest ratings.\n\n===2016===\n{{hidden begin|title=List of ratings in 2016 (Episodes 1 \u2013 11)|titlestyle=background:#FFFF66;}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Instead, what makes people open their mouth are smartphones, SNS (social networking service), message boards, divination and one more thing, spoons.\n\nPeople eat where, when, with whom and how; two hungry men plan on finding people who can have dinner with them. They press your doorbell, they are just curious about your dinner, let them listen to your story and let them become your family's members. Will you open the door for them?\n\n==Format==\nThere are few parts to the show and in completing the main mission, there are rules to follow.\n\n===Rules===\nThere are no fixed rules given by production team but the cast in episode 1 had set the following rules and respected them which are as follows:\n*Press the doorbell only from 18:00 (winter) or 18:30 (summer) to 20:00.\n*Do not return a second time to the same house which had rejected them before.\n*Do not eat anything given free by citizen on road (few exceptions exist like in episode 47, the members/guests accepted grapes).\n*Do not tell any people before 18:00 that will come back later. (i.e. no pre-arranged families are allowed)\n*Can insist maximum three times if people refuse. (Original on episode 1: Do not insist if people refuse)\n*Go to another family if any family member is uncomfortable about the shooting.\n*Do not enter a family which already had dinner.\n*The above rules also apply if they discover a celebrity's residence or a celebrity as a civilian (e.g. [[Seohyun]] on ep. 121 where her family house was discovered, and her car was discovered in 2017 when she was a civilian.)\n\n===Introduction of location and guests===\nThe hosts will start from a specific place and then proceed to the neighbourhood they are tasked to have dinner. The production team will give the hosts the mission they have to complete which usually reads: \"With a spoon on hand, go to (a selected place) and request to have dinner with a family\". Some additional details may be given such as on how to get to the destination (usually by walking / public transport). They may also be given clues to find their guests at a specific location. The production team will also offer the each cast member a same amount of money for travel or snacks during the day.\n\nThe cast will then proceed to find if there are any guests which will be joining them for dinner and the guest will be introduced. The guest/s are selected by the production team to join the cast as someone whom, if they rang our doorbell, we would really want to share a meal with.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Lee Ah-young|title=['\ud55c\ub07c\uc90d\uc1fc' 1\uc8fc\ub144\u2462] CP \"\ud558\uc815\uc6b0, \uac8c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc12d\uc678 1\uc21c\uc704\u2026\ud638\uac10+\uba39\ubc29\"|url=http://www.xportsnews.com/jenter/?ac=article_view&entry_id=904425|work=Xports News|date=October 18, 2017|accessdate=April 4, 2018|language=ko}}</ref> There are some episodes which the sequence is changed (i.e. the guests are found first and introduced and then given the mission card together with the cast members).\n\nThe cast will also give a brief introduction to the location as they move through the neighbourhood which may include introducing the beautiful sceneries, the culture and how the place got its name. Some short interviews may also be conducted with local residents to understand the neighbourhood better. In addition, the cast will usually enter a realtor office to find up more about the locality and obtain useful information such as the housing types (apartments, villas, or houses) as well as demographics which may influence the success or failure of the mission. At times, some famous personalities will be mentioned having a house in the region by the realtor also.\n\nThe cast will also recce the location and may identify some houses they will like to visit later.\n\n===Completion of the main mission===\nWhen the time for ringing bells starts, the cast will then decide how to team up for the mission. If there is no guest or only one guest is there, the members do the mission together with guest. If there are two guests, they can do the mission by team (member / guest, or member / member, or guest / guest) in the same area but with different families, or together with same family.\n\nThey will then start to ring the doorbells of households. Mission is deemed to be ''success'' if before 20:00, a family (with all members allowing) permits the cast members to go inside and have dinner with the entire family, talk and then take together a family photo which will also be presented to the families afterwards. A photo of the dinner that the cast had will also be taken as proof of mission success.\n\nMission is deemed to be a failure if they fail to do so. The cast will then head to a convenience store nearby to have a dinner with a local resident who is eating dinner in the store and use the rest of the money to buy their own dinner. They will still take a picture together and share lesser stories. This is deemed to be ''partial failure''. After 21:30, if they still cannot find a resident to eat with, it will be a ''complete failure'' and the cast/guest cannot eat anything at all for the day.\n\nBefore the cast members join the dinner table of any family, there is a segment called \"Dinner Theater\" when the family's members will take their dinner as per their daily normal routine for around two or three minutes. After dinner, there is another segment called \"Compliments and Disappointments\" when the family's members tell three compliments and three disappointments about each other. In few episodes, there is also segment where video messages are sent from family members to their extended family or loved ones. At times, the cast will also provide token of appreciation to the host family. The cast will also wash the plates for the meal and share final thoughts (in the epilogue of the episode when title credits are shown).\n\n==List of episodes==\n{{Main|List of Let's Eat Dinner Together episodes}}\n\n==Ratings==\nIn the table below, {{color|blue|'''the blue numbers'''}} represent the lowest ratings and {{color|red|'''the red numbers'''}} represent the highest ratings.\n\n===2016===\n{{hidden begin|title=List of ratings in 2016 (Episodes 1 \u2013 11)|titlestyle=background:#FFFF66;}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
