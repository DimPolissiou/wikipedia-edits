Here is when [[Complete set of commuting observables|CSCO (Complete set of commuting observables)]] comes into play. Here are some general results which are of general validity :\n\n1. A certain number of good quantum numbers can be used to specify uniquely a certain [[quantum state]] only when the [[observable]]s corresponding to the good quantum numbers form a [[Complete set of commuting observables|CSCO]].\n\n2. If the [[observable]]s commute, but don't form a CSCO, then their good quantum numbers refer to a set of states. In this case they don't refer to a state uniquely.\n\n3. If the [[observable]]s don't commute they can't even be used to refer to any set of states, let alone refer to any unique state.\n\nIn the case of hydrogen atom, the <math>L^2, J^2 ,  L_z , J_z</math> don't form a commuting set. But <math>n, l, m_\\text{l}, m_s</math> are the quantum numbers of a CSCO. So, are in this case, they form a set of good quantum numbers. Similarly,  <math>n, l, j, m_\\text{j}</math> too form a set of good quantum numbers.\n\n====The hydrogen atom: spin-orbit interaction included====\n\nIf the spin orbit interaction is taken into account, we have to add an extra term in [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] which represents the [[magnetic dipole]] interaction energy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Griffiths|first=David J.|title=Introduction to quantum mechanics|year=2005|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River|isbn=0131118927|page=271|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n:<math>\\Delta H_\\text{SO} =-\\boldsymbol{\\mu}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{B}.</math>\n\nNow, the new Hamiltonian with this new <math>\\Delta H_\\text{SO}</math> term doesn't [[Commutative property|commute]] with <math>\\boldsymbol{L}</math> and <math>\\boldsymbol{S}</math>; but it does commute with L<sup>2</sup>, S<sup>2</sup> and <math>\\boldsymbol{J}</math> , which is the [[total angular momentum]]. In other words, <math>l, j, m_\\text{l}, m_s</math> are no longer good quantum numbers, but <math> l, j , m_\\text{j}</math> are.\n\nAnd since, good quantum numbers are used to label the [[eigenstates]], the relevant formulae of interest are expressed in terms of them. For example, the spin-orbit interaction energy is given by<ref>{{cite book|last=Griffiths|first=David J.|title=Introduction to quantum mechanics|year=2005|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River|isbn=0131118927|page=273|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\Delta H_\\text{SO}= {\\beta\\over 2}(j(j+1) - l(l+1) -s(s+1))</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>\\beta = \\beta (n,l) = Z^4{\\mu_0\\over 4{\\pi}^4}g_\\text{s}\\mu_\\text{B}^2{1\\over n^3a_0^3l(l+1/2)(l+1)}</math>\nAs we can see, the above expressions contain the good quantum numbers, namely <math>l,s, j</math>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Complete set of commuting observables]]\n* [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)]]\n* [[Stationary state]]\n* [[Constant of motion]]\n* [[Quantum number]]\n* [[Measurement in quantum mechanics]]\n* [[Ehrenfest theorem]]\n* [[Operator (physics)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Quantum mechanics]]\n", "name_user": "Max.kit", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_quantum_number"}

In the [[Middle Ages]], the town rose to national significance with the establishment of [[Northampton Castle]], an occasional royal residence which regularly hosted the [[Parliament of England]]. Medieval Northampton had many churches, monasteries and the [[University of Northampton (thirteenth century)|University of Northampton]], all enclosed by the town walls. It was granted a [[town charter]] by [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] in 1189 and a mayor was appointed by [[John of England|King John]] in 1215. The town was also the site of two medieval battles, in [[Battle of Northampton (1264)|1264]] and [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|1460]].\n\nNorthampton supported the Parliamentary [[Roundhead]]s in the [[English Civil War]], and [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] ordered the destruction of the town walls and most of the castle. The [[Great Fire of Northampton]] in 1675 destroyed much of the town. It was soon rebuilt and grew rapidly with the industrial development of the 18th century. Northampton continued to grow with the arrival of the [[Grand Union Canal]] and the railways in the 19th century, becoming a centre for footwear and leather manufacture.\n\nNorthampton's growth was limited until it was designated as a [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Town]] in 1968, accelerating development in the town.

In the [[Middle Ages]], the town rose to national significance with the establishment of [[Northampton Castle]], an occasional royal residence which regularly hosted the [[Parliament of England]]. Medieval Northampton had many churches, monasteries and the [[University of Northampton (thirteenth century)|University of Northampton]], all enclosed by the town walls. It was granted a [[town charter]] by [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] in 1189 and a mayor was appointed by [[John of England|King John]] in 1215. The town was also the site of two medieval battles, in [[Battle of Northampton (1264)|1264]] and [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|1460]].\n\nNorthampton supported the Parliamentary [[Roundhead]]s in the [[English Civil War]], and [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] ordered the destruction of the town walls and most of the castle. The [[Great Fire of Northampton]] in 1675 destroyed much of the town. It was soon rebuilt and grew rapidly with the industrial development of the 18th century. Northampton continued to grow with the arrival of the [[Grand Union Canal]] and the railways in the 19th century, becoming a centre for footwear and leather manufacture.\n\nNorthampton's growth was limited until it was designated as a [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Town]] in 1968, accelerating development in the town.

Adolf was thrown off his horse, and was butchered by his opponent.

{"title_page": "Direct market", "text_new": "{{short description|Dominant distribution and retail network for American comic books, consisting of a monopoly (Diamond Comic Distributors, Inc.) and specialty stores}}\n{{Distinguish|Direct marketing}}\n[[File:Jay and Silent Bob's Secret Stash . Red Bank . New Jersey.jpg|thumb|300x300px|[[Jay and Silent Bob's Secret Stash]] comic book store in [[Red Bank, New Jersey]].]]\nThe '''direct market''' is the dominant [[distribution (business)|distribution]] and [[retailing|retail]] network for [[American comic book]]s. The concept of the direct market was created in the 1970s by [[Phil Seuling]].  It currently consists of [[Diamond Comic Distributors]], which has [[monopolization|monopolized]] such distribution (having [[exclusive dealing|exclusive deals]] with major comic book publishers), and the majority of comics [[specialty store]]s, as well as other retailers of comic books and related merchandise.\n\nThe name is no longer a fully accurate description of the model by which it operates, but derives from its original implementation: retailers bypassing existing distributors to make \"direct\" purchases from [[publisher]]s. The defining characteristic of the direct market however is non-returnability: unlike [[book store]] and [[news stand]] distribution, which operate on a sale-or-return model, direct market distribution prohibits distributors and retailers from returning their unsold merchandise for refunds. In exchange for more favorable ordering terms, retailers and distributors must gamble that they can accurately predict their customers' demand for products. Each month's surplus inventory, meanwhile, could be archived and sold later, driving the development of an organized market for \"back issues.\"\n\nThe emergence of this lower-risk distribution system is also credited with providing an opportunity for new comics publishers to enter the business, despite the two bigger publishers [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] and [[DC Comics]] still having the largest share. The establishment and growth of independent publishers and self-publishers, beginning in the late 1970s and continuing to the present, was made economically possible by the existence of a system that targets its retail audience, rather than relying on the scattershot approach embodied in the returnable newsstand system.\n\n== Comic book specialty shops ==\nPrior to the 1970s, most comics were found in [[newsstands]], grocery, drug, convenience, and toy stores. A handful of early comic book specialty shops first appeared in the late 1960s, stocking back issues as well as sourcing new releases from newsstand distributors and the new counterculture [[underground comix]]. The oldest known such comics specialty shop in North-America (or worldwide for that matter) has been Canadian comic book store Viking Bookshop, established in [[Toronto]] by \"Captain George\" Henderson in the spring of 1966, one year later renamed to Memory Lane Books when it relocated to other premises in the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://torontoist.com/2015/09/vintage-toronto-ads-memory-lane/ | title=Vintage Toronto Ads: Memory Lane &ndash; The story of \"Captain George\" Henderson, Toronto's first retailer to specialize in comic books. | first=Jamie |last=Bradburn | work=torontoist.com |date=2 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookdaily.com/championing_comics/progressive-shops/canadas-first-comic-shop/ |title=Canada\u2019s 1st Comic Shop? |first=Scott | last=VanderPloeg |date=14 September 2011 |work=comicbookdaily.com}}</ref> The oldest US comic book store is reputed to have been [[Gary Arlington]]'s San Francisco Comic Book Company which was established in April 1968 in the namesake city.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/underground.htm |title=Comics History: Underground comix and the underground press |work=lambiek.net}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://laughingsquid.com/gary-arlington-1938-2014-owner-of-the-first-comic-book-store-in-the-united-states/ |title=Gary Arlington (1938-2014), Owner of the First Comic Book Store in the United States |first=Lori | last=Dorn |date=6 February 2014 |work=laughingsquid.com}}</ref> Neither store is in existence anymore, though the third oldest known one, [[Amsterdam]]-based comic book store [[Lambiek]] (est. November 1968), still is as of 2019 &ndash; in the process becoming the oldest known comic book store still in existence. In the 1970s, the development of the direct market allowed a widespread network of comic shops to flourish. The specialty shop presented a number of competitive advantages:\n* Timing: direct-market specialty shops were often able to obtain new issues a week earlier than newsstand vendors.<ref>Rozanski, Chuck. \"[http://www.milehighcomics.com/tales/cbg110.html Tales From the Database: Destroying the Entry Point of Most New Readers].\" Mile High Comics, March 2004.</ref>\n* Condition: the wire racks of grocery, drug, and toy stores were often only half the height of comic books, resulting in bent spines and dog-eared pages. In contrast, direct market retail outlets usually attempt to maintain their inventory in good condition. Their shelves are often the full height of the comic book. Many stores also included backing boards and mylar bags to further protect comics upon purchase (a practice that began in the 1980s and continues in some shops today).\n* Content: direct-only stores could cater to older, more mature audiences, and thus can market material deemed too offensive (due to graphic violence, nudity, language, drug use, etc.) for grocery/drug/convenience/toy stores. In addition, due to the non-returnable nature of direct sales, typical direct-only stores contain a substantial archive of back issues. These retailers could also stock ancillary merchandise such as figurines, posters, toys, and novelties that would not be expected to be stocked by newsstands, etc.\n* Price: The older, more mature customers of direct-only stores are typically willing to pay several times more than the average customer of a grocery/drug/toy store. Cover prices approaching (or even exceeding) $5.00 became common.\n* Knowledge: The proprietors of direct-only stores are often collectors themselves, which means they are quite familiar with their inventories. Customers often have the option of phoning their orders in ahead of time, and by the time the customers arrive at the direct-only stores their orders will be set aside behind the counter (known as \"pull and hold\"). Direct-only store proprietors often arrange their inventory by publisher and/or genre, as opposed to the haphazard presentation of grocery/drug/toy stores.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Background ===\nBefore the direct market, most comic books were distributed through [[newsstands]], [[pharmacies]], and [[candy store]]s. The major distributors during this period included [[American News Company]] and the [[DC Comics]] property [[Independent News]]. [[Charlton Comics]] had their own distributor, Capital Distribution Company (CDC).<ref> Eury, Michael. ''Dick Giordano: Changing Comics, One Day at a Time'' (TwoMorrows Publishing, 2003), p. 42.</ref> This practice lasted from the 1930s through the 1960s.\n\n=== 1960s and 1970s===\nThe [[underground comix]] movement of the late 1960s was part of an alternative distribution network that also served the [[underground press]], which proliferated in the mid-1960s. As underground comix were not sold in newsstands or drugstores, [[head shops]] played an important role as retailers of those publications.<ref name=\"Estren-7\">{{cite book |last1=Estren |first1=Mark James |title=A History of Underground Comics |year=1993 |publisher=Ronin Publishing |isbn=0-914171-64-X |pages=7\u20138; 10 |chapter=Foreword: Onward! }}</ref> The underground comix movement was based in [[San Francisco]] and a number of distributors originated in the Bay Area, including the [[Print Mint]] (beginning c. 1969), the already mentioned comic book store San Francisco Comic Book Company (which doubled as a publisher, beginning c. 1970), [[Bud Plant Inc.]] (1970), [[Last Gasp]] (1970), [[Keith Green (art)|Keith Green/Industrial Realities]] (c. 1970), and Charles Abar Distribution. Around 1970, underground distributors sprang up in various regions of the U.S., including Los Angeles \u2014 [[George DiCaprio]] and Nova \u2014 and the Midwest \u2014 Donahoe Brothers Inc. (Ann Arbor, Michigan), Keep On Truckin' Coop/[[Big Rapids Distribution]] (Detroit, Michigan), [[Wisconsin Independent News Distributors]] (Madison, Wisconsin), Isis News (Minneapolis, Minnesota), and Well News Service (Columbus, Ohio).<ref>Distributor information, indicia, ''The Comics Journal'' #45 (March 1979).</ref> By the mid-1970s, Big Rapids had acquired all of its midwestern competitors; by that time, the market for underground comix had essentially dried up.<ref name=\"Estren-7\" />\n\nThe direct market as we know it was created in the early 1970s in response to the declining market for mainstream comic books on [[newsstand]]s. [[Fan convention]] organizer and comic dealer [[Phil Seuling]] approached publishers in 1972 to purchase comics directly from them, rather than going through traditional [[periodical]] distribution companies. Unlike the newsstand, or ID (for ''independent distributor'') market, which included drugstores, groceries, toy stores, convenience stores, and other magazine vendors, in which unsold units could be returned for credit, these purchases were non-returnable.  In return, comics specialty retailers received larger discounts on the books they ordered, since the publisher did not carry the risk of giving credit for unsold units. Instead, distributors and retailers shouldered the risk, in exchange for greater profits.\n\nAdditionally, retailers ordering comics through Seuling's [[Sea Gate Distributors]] (and within two years, through other companies) were able to set their own orders for each issue of each title, something which many local IDs did not allow. This ability to fine-tune an order was crucial to the establishment of a non-returnable system.<ref name=\"Evanier\">Evanier, Mark. [http://www.newsfromme.com/2004/12/31/phil-seuling-and-red-sonja/ \"Notes From Me,\" POV Online (Dec. 31, 2004).] Accessed Oct. 14, 2014.</ref>\n\nDirect distributors typically were much faster at getting the product into the hands of their customers than were IDs: a direct distribution warehouse generally had re-shipped a weekly batch of comics or delivered it to local customers within a day or two (sometimes within hours) of receiving the books from the printer. By contrast, most IDs would usually take two or even three weeks to do so, though some moved more quickly. This factor was a strong drawing card for retailers whose customer base consisted principally of fans eager to see the new issues each week.\n\nFinally, another factor in creating demand for direct sales distribution was that many IDs refused to deal with comics specialty shops or with any retailer who dealt in back issues on any terms at all, fearing that used comics could be purchased by these shops from readers for pennies, and then cycled back through the system as returns for full credit at a profit.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, other direct sales distribution concerns had sprung up, mostly regionally based (Donahoe Brothers in the Great Lakes region, [[Pacific Comics]] Distributors in Southern California, and [[New Media/Irjax]] in the Southeast were all operating by early 1974), essentially replacing the order-taking and fulfillment functions of newsstand distributors for the infant comic shop specialty market. For several years, [[Sea Gate Distributors|Seagate]] retained an edge over its competitors in that it was able to provide \"drop shipping\" (the shipment of an order directly from the printer to the retailer) to its customers for quantities of 25 or multiples thereof per issue, while the newer distributors had to use more conventional methods, putting together customer orders and re-shipping or delivering them from their own warehouses. Threats of legal action<ref name=\"DuinDD\">\"Direct Distribution\" in Duin, Steve and [[Mike Richardson (publisher)|Richardson, Mike]] (ed.s). ''Comics Between the Panels'' ([[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse Publishing]], 1998), pp. 126-130.</ref> and the need for retailers to order very precise (and sometimes very small) quantities of items ended this practice for all but the largest customers by the end of the 1970s, and extended the ability to provide drop shipping to those large customers to all the direct distributors \u2014 by which time several of the newer distributors had multiple warehouses.\n\nNewsstand distribution through the IDs continued at the same time (and indeed remained dominant for years afterward, on its conventional returnable, low-discount terms).\n\n=== 1980s ===\nIn the early 1980s, a trade organization, the [[International Association of Direct Distributors]] ('''IADD''') was formed, consisting of all the distributors who purchased product directly from either DC, Marvel, or both. The IADD had annual conferences, issuing obscenity guidelines in 1987,<ref>\"Newswatch: Distributor Organization Issues Guidelines About Obscenity,\" ''The Comics Journal'' #117 (September 1987), p. 14.</ref> and electing [[Diamond Comic Distributors]]' [[Steve Geppi]] as IADD Vice President in 1988.<ref>\"Newswatch: Diamond's Steve Geppi Elected IADD VP,\" ''The Comics Journal'' #125 (October 1988), p. 25.</ref>\n\nAs early as 1980, Marvel Comics saw the growth potential of the direct market,<ref>\"Marvel Focuses On Direct Sales,\" ''The Comics Journal'' #59 (October 1980), pp. 11-12.</ref> and by 1981 was putting out a number of titles geared specifically to that market (including ''[[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]]''). By the early 1980s, all the major publishers were producing material specifically for the new market, series that would probably not sell well enough on the newsstand, but sold well enough on a non-returnable basis to the more dedicated readers of the direct market to be profitable.<ref>\"The Direct Sales Boom,\" ''The Comics Journal'' #64 (July 1981), p. 7.</ref>\n\nSeveral of the new distributors lasted a relatively short time, and were succeeded by more competitive organizations; with no continuity of ownership and only limited continuity of personnel, it would nonetheless be fair to say that [[Diamond Comic Distributors]] replaced [[New Media/Irjax]] and [[Capital City Distribution]] largely replaced [[Big Rapids Distribution]] in the marketplace.\n\nBy 1985, the number of direct distributors in North America peaked with approximately twenty companies, many of them multi-warehouse operations, purchasing product for resale to retailers directly from either DC Comics, Marvel Comics, or both. There were also an unknown number, probably in the dozens, of sub-distributors who bought DC and Marvel product from these larger companies (and often the products of other, smaller publishers direct from those publishers), and re-sold to retailers. Most of these sub-distributors were in cities in which the direct distributors themselves did not (at least as yet) have warehouses, including [[Philadelphia]], [[Boston]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] (Ohio), [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] (Wisconsin), [[Lansing]] (Michigan), [[Indianapolis]], and [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] (California). Many of them were eventually absorbed by the companies which had been their principal suppliers.\n\nFrom the mid-80s to the mid-90s, nearly every major urban area in the United States had at least one (and sometimes two or three) local direct distribution warehouses that functioned not only as distribution points for pre-ordered weekly shipments, but also as what could be described as \"supermarkets for retailers\", where store owners could shop for reorders and examine and purchase product that they might not have ordered in advance.\n\n=== 1990s ===\nAs newsstand sales continued to decline, the Direct Market became the primary market of the two major comics publishers ([[DC Comics]] and [[Marvel Comics]]).<ref name=\"Evanier\" /> In the late 1980s and early 1990s, as the popularity of comics collecting grew, many new comics shops opened, and existing retailers (such as [[sports card]] shops) joined the Direct Market, carrying comics as a side business. By this time, Diamond and Capital City each had approximately twenty warehouses from coast to coast, and both were functioning as fully national distributors. Several of their larger remaining competitors, notably Glenwood, Longhorn, and [[Bud Plant]], had either sold out or gone out of business.\n\nSuch rapid growth (due partially to [[speculation]]) was [[economic bubble|unsustainable]], however. The market contracted in the mid-1990s, leading to the closure of many Direct Market shops.<ref>Miller, John Jackson. [http://www.cbgxtra.com/default.aspx?tabid=42&view=topic&forumid=34&postid=6606 \"Nov. 17, 1992: A $30 Million Day \u2014 and the Days After,\"] \"The 1900s: 10 biggest events from 100 years in comics,\" CBGXtra.com (Dec. 12, 2005).</ref> Diamond and Capital City began closing local warehouses, moving from a decentralized model in which many local warehouses provided full service to a given area to a centralized one with a few shipping hubs and no local walk-in service at all. In 1994, Capital City created controversy by announcing penalties for publishers who didn't deliver their products within promised deadlines; this move followed an industry-wide push for 30-day returnability, a practice formerly in use when comics were primarily distributed in newsstands.<ref>\"Newswatch: Capital Announces Controversial Penalty Fees for Publishers: Move Follows Industry-wide Push for 30-day Returnability,\" ''The Comics Journal'' #166 (February 1994), pp. 17\u201326.</ref>\n\nIn early 1995, Marvel Comics purchased [[Heroes World]], by that time the third largest distributor behind Diamond and Capital City,<ref>Gray, Bob. \"Newswatch: Marvel Buys 3rd Largest Distributor: Heroes World Purchase Signals Fundamental Changes in the Direct Market,\" ''The Comics Journal'' #174 (February 1995), p. 15-22.</ref><ref>Gertler, Nat. \"Marvel Buys Heroes World,\" ''Hogan's Alley'', v. 1, no. 2 (1995), p. 17.</ref> with the intention of [[vertical integration|self-distributing]] their products; Heroes World also stopped carrying other publishers' books.  Other distributors sought exclusive deals with other major publishers to compensate for the substantial loss of Marvel's business. DC Comics, [[Image Comics]], [[Dark Horse Comics]], and several smaller publishers made exclusive deals with [[Diamond Comic Distributors]].<ref>\"Newswatch: Tip 11: Go Exclusive with Diamond\" ''The Comics Journal'' #185 (Mar. 1996), p. 27.</ref>  Most other distributors, including [[Capital City Distribution]], Diamond's main competitor at the time, either went out of business or were acquired by Diamond.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1996_July_26/ai_18526328 \"Diamond Comic Distributors acquires Capital City Distribution; Comic distribution industry stabilized by purchase,\" bNet: Business Wire (July 26, 1996).]</ref> Others established niches \u2014 such as re-orders \u2014 in which they could compete.  When self-distribution failed to meet Marvel's objectives, they also signed an exclusive distribution deal with Diamond, which had by then become the primary supplier for the Direct Market.\n\n=== 2000s ===\nIn the early 2000s, the [[bookstore]] market began to challenge the Direct Market as a channel for sales of increasingly popular [[graphic novel]]s. Meanwhile, Diamond has continued to dominate direct-market distribution, with the 2006 collapse of [[FM International]] leaving even less competition than ever. However, the growth of interest in comics among mainstream booksellers and book publishers has led to several publishers arranging for bookstore distribution outside of Diamond (for example, [[Tokyopop]] through [[HarperCollins]],<ref>[http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/8430.html \"Tokyopop Signs Alliance with HarperCollins: For Co-Publishing and Distribution,\" ICv2 (Mar. 28, 2006.]</ref> or [[Fantagraphics]] through [[W.

Red Bank . New Jersey.jpg|thumb|300x300px|[[Jay and Silent Bob's Secret Stash]] comic book store in [[Red Bank, New Jersey]].]]\nThe '''direct market''' is the dominant [[distribution (business)|distribution]] and [[retailing|retail]] network for [[American comic book]]s. The concept of the direct market was created in the 1970s by [[Phil Seuling]].  It currently consists of [[Diamond Comic Distributors]], which has [[monopolization|monopolized]] such distribution (having [[exclusive dealing|exclusive deals]] with major comic book publishers), and the majority of comics [[specialty store]]s, as well as other retailers of comic books and related merchandise.\n\nThe name is no longer a fully accurate description of the model by which it operates, but derives from its original implementation: retailers bypassing existing distributors to make \"direct\" purchases from [[publisher]]s. The defining characteristic of the direct market however is non-returnability: unlike [[book store]] and [[news stand]] distribution, which operate on a sale-or-return model, direct market distribution prohibits distributors and retailers from returning their unsold merchandise for refunds. In exchange for more favorable ordering terms, retailers and distributors must gamble that they can accurately predict their customers' demand for products. Each month's surplus inventory, meanwhile, could be archived and sold later, driving the development of an organized market for \"back issues.\"\n\nThe emergence of this lower-risk distribution system is also credited with providing an opportunity for new comics publishers to enter the business, despite the two bigger publishers [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] and [[DC Comics]] still having the largest share. The establishment and growth of independent publishers and self-publishers, beginning in the late 1970s and continuing to the present, was made economically possible by the existence of a system that targets its retail audience, rather than relying on the scattershot approach embodied in the returnable newsstand system.\n\n== Comic book specialty shops ==\nPrior to the 1970s, most comics were found in [[newsstands]], grocery, drug, convenience, and toy stores. A handful of early comic book specialty shops first appeared in the late 1960s, stocking back issues as well as sourcing new releases from newsstand distributors and the new counterculture [[underground comix]]. The oldest known such comics specialty shop in North-America (or worldwide for that matter) has been Canadian comic book store Viking Bookshop, established in [[Toronto]] by \"Captain George\" Henderson in the spring of 1966, one year later renamed to Memory Lane Books when it relocated to other premises in the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://torontoist.com/2015/09/vintage-toronto-ads-memory-lane/ | title=Vintage Toronto Ads: Memory Lane &ndash; The story of \"Captain George\" Henderson, Toronto's first retailer to specialize in comic books. | first=Jamie |last=Bradburn | work=torontoist.com |date=2 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookdaily.com/championing_comics/progressive-shops/canadas-first-comic-shop/ |title=Canada\u2019s 1st Comic Shop? |first=Scott | last=VanderPloeg |date=14 September 2011 |work=comicbookdaily.com}}</ref> The oldest US comic book store is reputed to have been [[Gary Arlington]]'s San Francisco Comic Book Company which was established in April 1968 in the namesake city.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/underground.htm |title=Comics History: Underground comix and the underground press |work=lambiek.net}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://laughingsquid.com/gary-arlington-1938-2014-owner-of-the-first-comic-book-store-in-the-united-states/ |title=Gary Arlington (1938-2014), Owner of the First Comic Book Store in the United States |first=Lori | last=Dorn |date=6 February 2014 |work=laughingsquid.com}}</ref> Neither store is in existence anymore, though the third oldest known one, [[Amsterdam]]-based comic book store [[Lambiek]] (est. November 1968), still is as of 2019 &ndash; in the process becoming the oldest known comic book store still in existence. In the 1970s, the development of the direct market allowed a widespread network of comic shops to flourish. The specialty shop presented a number of competitive advantages:\n* Timing: direct-market specialty shops were often able to obtain new issues a week earlier than newsstand vendors.<ref>Rozanski, Chuck. \"[http://www.milehighcomics.com/tales/cbg110.html Tales From the Database: Destroying the Entry Point of Most New Readers].\" Mile High Comics, March 2004.</ref>\n* Condition: the wire racks of grocery, drug, and toy stores were often only half the height of comic books, resulting in bent spines and dog-eared pages. In contrast, direct market retail outlets usually attempt to maintain their inventory in good condition. Their shelves are often the full height of the comic book. Many stores also included backing boards and mylar bags to further protect comics upon purchase (a practice that began in the 1980s and continues in some shops today).\n* Content: direct-only stores could cater to older, more mature audiences, and thus can market material deemed too offensive (due to graphic violence, nudity, language, drug use, etc.) for grocery/drug/convenience/toy stores. In addition, due to the non-returnable nature of direct sales, typical direct-only stores contain a substantial archive of back issues. These retailers could also stock ancillary merchandise such as figurines, posters, toys, and novelties that would not be expected to be stocked by newsstands, etc.\n* Price: The older, more mature customers of direct-only stores are typically willing to pay several times more than the average customer of a grocery/drug/toy store. Cover prices approaching (or even exceeding) $5.00 became common.\n* Knowledge: The proprietors of direct-only stores are often collectors themselves, which means they are quite familiar with their inventories. Customers often have the option of phoning their orders in ahead of time, and by the time the customers arrive at the direct-only stores their orders will be set aside behind the counter (known as \"pull and hold\"). Direct-only store proprietors often arrange their inventory by publisher and/or genre, as opposed to the haphazard presentation of grocery/drug/toy stores.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Background ===\nBefore the direct market, most comic books were distributed through [[newsstands]], [[pharmacies]], and [[candy store]]s. The major distributors during this period included [[American News Company]] and the [[DC Comics]] property [[Independent News]]. [[Charlton Comics]] had their own distributor, Capital Distribution Company (CDC).<ref> Eury, Michael. ''Dick Giordano: Changing Comics, One Day at a Time'' (TwoMorrows Publishing, 2003), p. 42.</ref> This practice lasted from the 1930s through the 1960s.\n\n=== 1960s and 1970s===\nThe [[underground comix]] movement of the late 1960s was part of an alternative distribution network that also served the [[underground press]], which proliferated in the mid-1960s. As underground comix were not sold in newsstands or drugstores, [[head shops]] played an important role as retailers of those publications.<ref name=\"Estren-7\">{{cite book |last1=Estren |first1=Mark James |title=A History of Underground Comics |year=1993 |publisher=Ronin Publishing |isbn=0-914171-64-X |pages=7\u20138; 10 |chapter=Foreword: Onward! }}</ref> The underground comix movement was based in [[San Francisco]] and a number of distributors originated in the Bay Area, including the [[Print Mint]] (beginning c. 1969), the already mentioned comic book store San Francisco Comic Book Company (which doubled as a publisher, beginning c. 1970), [[Bud Plant Inc.]] (1970), [[Last Gasp]] (1970), [[Keith Green (art)|Keith Green/Industrial Realities]] (c. 1970), and Charles Abar Distribution. Around 1970, underground distributors sprang up in various regions of the U.S., including Los Angeles \u2014 [[George DiCaprio]] and Nova \u2014 and the Midwest \u2014 Donahoe Brothers Inc. (Ann Arbor, Michigan), Keep On Truckin' Coop/[[Big Rapids Distribution]] (Detroit, Michigan), [[Wisconsin Independent News Distributors]] (Madison, Wisconsin), Isis News (Minneapolis, Minnesota), and Well News Service (Columbus, Ohio).<ref>Distributor information, indicia, ''The Comics Journal'' #45 (March 1979).</ref> By the mid-1970s, Big Rapids had acquired all of its midwestern competitors; by that time, the market for underground comix had essentially dried up.<ref name=\"Estren-7\" />\n\nThe direct market as we know it was created in the early 1970s in response to the declining market for mainstream comic books on [[newsstand]]s. [[Fan convention]] organizer and comic dealer [[Phil Seuling]] approached publishers in 1972 to purchase comics directly from them, rather than going through traditional [[periodical]] distribution companies. Unlike the newsstand, or ID (for ''independent distributor'') market, which included drugstores, groceries, toy stores, convenience stores, and other magazine vendors, in which unsold units could be returned for credit, these purchases were non-returnable.  In return, comics specialty retailers received larger discounts on the books they ordered, since the publisher did not carry the risk of giving credit for unsold units. Instead, distributors and retailers shouldered the risk, in exchange for greater profits.\n\nAdditionally, retailers ordering comics through Seuling's [[Sea Gate Distributors]] (and within two years, through other companies) were able to set their own orders for each issue of each title, something which many local IDs did not allow. This ability to fine-tune an order was crucial to the establishment of a non-returnable system.<ref name=\"Evanier\">Evanier, Mark. [http://www.newsfromme.com/2004/12/31/phil-seuling-and-red-sonja/ \"Notes From Me,\" POV Online (Dec. 31, 2004).] Accessed Oct. 14, 2014.</ref>\n\nDirect distributors typically were much faster at getting the product into the hands of their customers than were IDs: a direct distribution warehouse generally had re-shipped a weekly batch of comics or delivered it to local customers within a day or two (sometimes within hours) of receiving the books from the printer. By contrast, most IDs would usually take two or even three weeks to do so, though some moved more quickly. This factor was a strong drawing card for retailers whose customer base consisted principally of fans eager to see the new issues each week.\n\nFinally, another factor in creating demand for direct sales distribution was that many IDs refused to deal with comics specialty shops or with any retailer who dealt in back issues on any terms at all, fearing that used comics could be purchased by these shops from readers for pennies, and then cycled back through the system as returns for full credit at a profit.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, other direct sales distribution concerns had sprung up, mostly regionally based (Donahoe Brothers in the Great Lakes region, [[Pacific Comics]] Distributors in Southern California, and [[New Media/Irjax]] in the Southeast were all operating by early 1974), essentially replacing the order-taking and fulfillment functions of newsstand distributors for the infant comic shop specialty market. For several years, [[Sea Gate Distributors|Seagate]] retained an edge over its competitors in that it was able to provide \"drop shipping\" (the shipment of an order directly from the printer to the retailer) to its customers for quantities of 25 or multiples thereof per issue, while the newer distributors had to use more conventional methods, putting together customer orders and re-shipping or delivering them from their own warehouses. Threats of legal action<ref name=\"DuinDD\">\"Direct Distribution\" in Duin, Steve and [[Mike Richardson (publisher)|Richardson, Mike]] (ed.s). ''Comics Between the Panels'' ([[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse Publishing]], 1998), pp. 126-130.</ref> and the need for retailers to order very precise (and sometimes very small) quantities of items ended this practice for all but the largest customers by the end of the 1970s, and extended the ability to provide drop shipping to those large customers to all the direct distributors \u2014 by which time several of the newer distributors had multiple warehouses.\n\nNewsstand distribution through the IDs continued at the same time (and indeed remained dominant for years afterward, on its conventional returnable, low-discount terms).\n\n=== 1980s ===\nIn the early 1980s, a trade organization, the [[International Association of Direct Distributors]] ('''IADD''') was formed, consisting of all the distributors who purchased product directly from either DC, Marvel, or both. The IADD had annual conferences, issuing obscenity guidelines in 1987,<ref>\"Newswatch: Distributor Organization Issues Guidelines About Obscenity,\" ''The Comics Journal'' #117 (September 1987), p. 14.</ref> and electing [[Diamond Comic Distributors]]' [[Steve Geppi]] as IADD Vice President in 1988.<ref>\"Newswatch: Diamond's Steve Geppi Elected IADD VP,\" ''The Comics Journal'' #125 (October 1988), p. 25.</ref>\n\nAs early as 1980, Marvel Comics saw the growth potential of the direct market,<ref>\"Marvel Focuses On Direct Sales,\" ''The Comics Journal'' #59 (October 1980), pp. 11-12.</ref> and by 1981 was putting out a number of titles geared specifically to that market (including ''[[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]]''). By the early 1980s, all the major publishers were producing material specifically for the new market, series that would probably not sell well enough on the newsstand, but sold well enough on a non-returnable basis to the more dedicated readers of the direct market to be profitable.<ref>\"The Direct Sales Boom,\" ''The Comics Journal'' #64 (July 1981), p. 7.</ref>\n\nSeveral of the new distributors lasted a relatively short time, and were succeeded by more competitive organizations; with no continuity of ownership and only limited continuity of personnel, it would nonetheless be fair to say that [[Diamond Comic Distributors]] replaced [[New Media/Irjax]] and [[Capital City Distribution]] largely replaced [[Big Rapids Distribution]] in the marketplace.\n\nBy 1985, the number of direct distributors in North America peaked with approximately twenty companies, many of them multi-warehouse operations, purchasing product for resale to retailers directly from either DC Comics, Marvel Comics, or both. There were also an unknown number, probably in the dozens, of sub-distributors who bought DC and Marvel product from these larger companies (and often the products of other, smaller publishers direct from those publishers), and re-sold to retailers. Most of these sub-distributors were in cities in which the direct distributors themselves did not (at least as yet) have warehouses, including [[Philadelphia]], [[Boston]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] (Ohio), [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] (Wisconsin), [[Lansing]] (Michigan), [[Indianapolis]], and [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] (California). Many of them were eventually absorbed by the companies which had been their principal suppliers.\n\nFrom the mid-80s to the mid-90s, nearly every major urban area in the United States had at least one (and sometimes two or three) local direct distribution warehouses that functioned not only as distribution points for pre-ordered weekly shipments, but also as what could be described as \"supermarkets for retailers\", where store owners could shop for reorders and examine and purchase product that they might not have ordered in advance.\n\n=== 1990s ===\nAs newsstand sales continued to decline, the Direct Market became the primary market of the two major comics publishers ([[DC Comics]] and [[Marvel Comics]]).<ref name=\"Evanier\" /> In the late 1980s and early 1990s, as the popularity of comics collecting grew, many new comics shops opened, and existing retailers (such as [[sports card]] shops) joined the Direct Market, carrying comics as a side business. By this time, Diamond and Capital City each had approximately twenty warehouses from coast to coast, and both were functioning as fully national distributors. Several of their larger remaining competitors, notably Glenwood, Longhorn, and [[Bud Plant]], had either sold out or gone out of business.\n\nSuch rapid growth (due partially to [[speculation]]) was [[economic bubble|unsustainable]], however. The market contracted in the mid-1990s, leading to the closure of many Direct Market shops.<ref>Miller, John Jackson. [http://www.cbgxtra.com/default.aspx?tabid=42&view=topic&forumid=34&postid=6606 \"Nov. 17, 1992: A $30 Million Day \u2014 and the Days After,\"] \"The 1900s: 10 biggest events from 100 years in comics,\" CBGXtra.com (Dec. 12, 2005).</ref> Diamond and Capital City began closing local warehouses, moving from a decentralized model in which many local warehouses provided full service to a given area to a centralized one with a few shipping hubs and no local walk-in service at all. In 1994, Capital City created controversy by announcing penalties for publishers who didn't deliver their products within promised deadlines; this move followed an industry-wide push for 30-day returnability, a practice formerly in use when comics were primarily distributed in newsstands.<ref>\"Newswatch: Capital Announces Controversial Penalty Fees for Publishers: Move Follows Industry-wide Push for 30-day Returnability,\" ''The Comics Journal'' #166 (February 1994), pp. 17\u201326.</ref>\n\nIn early 1995, Marvel Comics purchased [[Heroes World]], by that time the third largest distributor behind Diamond and Capital City,<ref>Gray, Bob. \"Newswatch: Marvel Buys 3rd Largest Distributor: Heroes World Purchase Signals Fundamental Changes in the Direct Market,\" ''The Comics Journal'' #174 (February 1995), p. 15-22.</ref><ref>Gertler, Nat. \"Marvel Buys Heroes World,\" ''Hogan's Alley'', v. 1, no. 2 (1995), p. 17.</ref> with the intention of [[vertical integration|self-distributing]] their products; Heroes World also stopped carrying other publishers' books.  Other distributors sought exclusive deals with other major publishers to compensate for the substantial loss of Marvel's business. DC Comics, [[Image Comics]], [[Dark Horse Comics]], and several smaller publishers made exclusive deals with [[Diamond Comic Distributors]].<ref>\"Newswatch: Tip 11: Go Exclusive with Diamond\" ''The Comics Journal'' #185 (Mar. 1996), p. 27.</ref>  Most other distributors, including [[Capital City Distribution]], Diamond's main competitor at the time, either went out of business or were acquired by Diamond.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1996_July_26/ai_18526328 \"Diamond Comic Distributors acquires Capital City Distribution; Comic distribution industry stabilized by purchase,\" bNet: Business Wire (July 26, 1996).]</ref> Others established niches \u2014 such as re-orders \u2014 in which they could compete.  When self-distribution failed to meet Marvel's objectives, they also signed an exclusive distribution deal with Diamond, which had by then become the primary supplier for the Direct Market.\n\n=== 2000s ===\nIn the early 2000s, the [[bookstore]] market began to challenge the Direct Market as a channel for sales of increasingly popular [[graphic novel]]s. Meanwhile, Diamond has continued to dominate direct-market distribution, with the 2006 collapse of [[FM International]] leaving even less competition than ever. However, the growth of interest in comics among mainstream booksellers and book publishers has led to several publishers arranging for bookstore distribution outside of Diamond (for example, [[Tokyopop]] through [[HarperCollins]],<ref>[http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/8430.html \"Tokyopop Signs Alliance with HarperCollins: For Co-Publishing and Distribution,\" ICv2 (Mar. 28, 2006.]</ref> or [[Fantagraphics]] through [[W.

Part Deux]]'' in 1993. The film is primarily a [[parody]] of ''[[Top Gun]]'', with some scenes spoofing other popular films, including ''[[9\u00bd Weeks|{{frac|9|1|2}} Weeks]]'', ''[[The Fabulous Baker Boys]]'', ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'', ''[[Marathon Man (film)|Marathon Man]]'', ''[[Rocky]]'', ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' and ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film begins at Flemner Air Base 20 years in the past. A pilot named Leland \"Buzz\" Harley ([[Bill Irwin]]) loses control of his plane and ejects, leaving his co-pilot Dominic \"Mailman\" Farnham ([[Ryan Stiles]]) to crash. Although Mailman survives, he is mistaken for a deer owing to the branches stuck to his helmet and is shot by a hunter.\n\nTopper Harley ([[Charlie Sheen]]) wakes up from a nightmare he is having about the event when Lt. Commander Block ([[Kevin Dunn]]) asks him to return to active duty as a pilot in the [[U.S. Navy]], to help on a new top secret mission: Operation Sleepy Weasel, commanded by the incompetent and oblivious [[Admiral]] Benson ([[Lloyd Bridges]]). Harley starts to show some psychological problems, especially when his father is mentioned. His therapist, Ramada ([[Valeria Golino]]), tries to keep Topper from flying, but she relents, and also starts to build a budding romance with Topper. Meanwhile, Topper gets into a rivalry with another fighter pilot, Kent Gregory ([[Cary Elwes]]), a former lover of Ramada and Mailman's son, who blames Buzz Harley for his father's death and believes Topper cannot handle combat pressure.\n\nMeanwhile, Block starts privately meeting with an airplane tycoon, Mr. Wilson, who has recently built a new \"Super Fighter\" that will make the American pilots superior. Block reveals that he brought back Topper for the reason of making Sleepy Weasel fail. Block would then report that it was the Navy's planes that were the real reason for the mission failure and that they need to be replaced with Wilson's planes. During one of the last training missions, an accident between Pete \"Dead Meat\" Thompson ([[William O'Leary (actor)|William O'Leary]]) and Jim \"Wash-Out\" Pfaffenbach ([[Jon Cryer]]) leaves Dead Meat dead and Wash Out reassigned to radar operator. Block believes this is enough to convince the Navy to buy new fighters, but Wilson calls it a \"minor incident\", saying the planes need to fail in combat.\n\nMeanwhile, Topper starts to show more feelings for Ramada, but she is conflicted by her past with Gregory. On the [[aircraft carrier|carrier]] S.S. ''Essess'', Benson reveals the mission to be an attack of an Iraqi nuclear plant and Block assigns Topper to lead the mission, much to Gregory's chagrin. Wilson, who is also on board, instructs a crew member to sabotage the planes, putting the pilots' lives at risk. In the midst of the mission, Block mentions Buzz Harley to Topper, who becomes overcome with emotion and unable to lead. Block just starts to call out for the mission to be aborted when Iraqi fighters attack the squadron. All the planes' weapons fail, and Block, realizing what has happened, tells Topper that he saw what really happened with Buzz and Mailman: That Buzz tried to do everything possible to save Mailman, but ended up falling out of the plane, failing in his attempts.\n\nInspired, Topper single-handedly beats the Iraqi fighters and bombs the nuclear plant, dropping a bomb directly on Saddam Hussein (who was taking a sunbath at the plant).

It stars [[Charlie Sheen]], [[Cary Elwes]], [[Valeria Golino]], [[Lloyd Bridges]], [[Jon Cryer]], [[Kevin Dunn]], [[Kristy Swanson]], and [[Bill Irwin]].<ref name=\"Hot Shots!\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/78455/Hot-Shots-/|title=Hot Shots!|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|accessdate=March 3, 2016}}</ref>  It was followed by a sequel, ''[[Hot Shots! Part Deux]]'' in 1993. The film is primarily a [[parody]] of ''[[Top Gun]]'', with some scenes spoofing other popular films, including ''[[9\u00bd Weeks|{{frac|9|1|2}} Weeks]]'', ''[[The Fabulous Baker Boys]]'', ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'', ''[[Marathon Man (film)|Marathon Man]]'', ''[[Rocky]]'', ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' and ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film begins at Flemner Air Base 20 years in the past. A pilot named Leland \"Buzz\" Harley ([[Bill Irwin]]) loses control of his plane and ejects, leaving his co-pilot Dominic \"Mailman\" Farnham ([[Ryan Stiles]]) to crash. Although Mailman survives, he is mistaken for a deer owing to the branches stuck to his helmet and is shot by a hunter.\n\nTopper Harley ([[Charlie Sheen]]) wakes up from a nightmare he is having about the event when Lt. Commander Block ([[Kevin Dunn]]) asks him to return to active duty as a pilot in the [[U.S. Navy]], to help on a new top secret mission: Operation Sleepy Weasel, commanded by the incompetent and oblivious [[Admiral]] Benson ([[Lloyd Bridges]]). Harley starts to show some psychological problems, especially when his father is mentioned. His therapist, Ramada ([[Valeria Golino]]), tries to keep Topper from flying, but she relents, and also starts to build a budding romance with Topper. Meanwhile, Topper gets into a rivalry with another fighter pilot, Kent Gregory ([[Cary Elwes]]), a former lover of Ramada and Mailman's son, who blames Buzz Harley for his father's death and believes Topper cannot handle combat pressure.\n\nMeanwhile, Block starts privately meeting with an airplane tycoon, Mr. Wilson, who has recently built a new \"Super Fighter\" that will make the American pilots superior. Block reveals that he brought back Topper for the reason of making Sleepy Weasel fail. Block would then report that it was the Navy's planes that were the real reason for the mission failure and that they need to be replaced with Wilson's planes. During one of the last training missions, an accident between Pete \"Dead Meat\" Thompson ([[William O'Leary (actor)|William O'Leary]]) and Jim \"Wash-Out\" Pfaffenbach ([[Jon Cryer]]) leaves Dead Meat dead and Wash Out reassigned to radar operator. Block believes this is enough to convince the Navy to buy new fighters, but Wilson calls it a \"minor incident\", saying the planes need to fail in combat.\n\nMeanwhile, Topper starts to show more feelings for Ramada, but she is conflicted by her past with Gregory. On the [[aircraft carrier|carrier]] U.S.S. ''Essess'', Benson reveals the mission to be an attack of an Iraqi nuclear plant and Block assigns Topper to lead the mission, much to Gregory's chagrin. Wilson, who is also on board, instructs a crew member to sabotage the planes, putting the pilots' lives at risk. In the midst of the mission, Block mentions Buzz Harley to Topper, who becomes overcome with emotion and unable to lead. Block just starts to call out for the mission to be aborted when Iraqi fighters attack the squadron. All the planes' weapons fail, and Block, realizing what has happened, tells Topper that he saw what really happened with Buzz and Mailman: That Buzz tried to do everything possible to save Mailman, but ended up falling out of the plane, failing in his attempts.\n\nInspired, Topper single-handedly beats the Iraqi fighters and bombs the nuclear plant, dropping a bomb directly on Saddam Hussein (who was taking a sunbath at the plant). Back aboard ship, Wilson's plan is revealed, and his standing with the military is lost. Back in port, Gregory accepts Topper as a great pilot and lets Ramada be with Topper. The end credits show Dead Meat and Mailman in spirit with Dead Meat saluting and Mailman giving a thumbs up.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Charlie Sheen]] as LT Sean \"Topper\" Harley\n* [[Cary Elwes]] as LT Kent Gregory\n* [[Valeria Golino]] as Ramada Thompson\n* [[Lloyd Bridges]] as RADM Thomas \"Tug\" Benson\n* [[Kevin Dunn]] as LCDR James Block\n* [[Jon Cryer]] as LT Jim \"Wash Out\" Pfaffenbach\n* [[William O'Leary (actor)|William O'Leary]] as LT Pete \"Dead Meat\" Thompson\n* [[Kristy Swanson]] as Kowalski\n* [[Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.]] as Wilson\n* [[Bill Irwin]] as Leland \"Buzz\" Harley\n* [[Ryan Stiles]] as Dominic \"Mailman\" Farnham\n* [[Heidi Swedberg]] as Mary Thompson\n* [[Rino Thunder]] as Owatonna 'The Old One'\n* [[Charles Barkley]] as himself\n* [[Don Lake]] as Roy\n* [[Cylk Cozart]] as Drill Sergeant\n* [[Bill Laimbeer]] as himself\n* Jerry Haleva as [[Saddam Hussein]]\n* [[Gene Greytak]] as [[Pope John Paul II]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Critical reception==\nThe film debuted at number one in the United States.<ref>{{cite news|title= Weekend Box Office : List-Toppers Are Listless|publisher= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=1991-08-27|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1991-08-27/entertainment/ca-1886_1_weekend-box-office|accessdate=2011-01-13|first=David J.|last=Fox}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Weekend Box Office : 'Terminator 2' Surrenders Top Spot |work= The Los Angeles Times|date=1991-08-06|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1991-08-06/entertainment/ca-693_1_weekend-box-office|accessdate=2011-01-02|first=Daniel|last=Cerone}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= In the Wake of 'Terminator 2,' a Slow Season : Box office: With three weeks to go in the summer, it appears there will be no records set.

[[Endemic (ecology)|Endemic]] to [[Africa]], it is usually found in the open grasslands and savannah of the [[Sub-Saharan Africa|sub-Saharan region]]. [[John Frederick Miller]] described the species in 1779. Although a member of the order [[Accipitriformes]], which also includes many other [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]] birds of prey such as [[kite (bird)|kites]], [[hawk]]s, [[vulture]]s, and [[harrier (bird)|harriers]], it is placed in its own family, [[Sagittariidae]]. The secretarybird is instantly recognisable as a very large bird with an eagle-like body on [[crane (bird)|crane-like]] legs which increases the bird's height to as much as {{convert|1.3|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The sexes are similar in appearance. Adults have a featherless red-orange face and predominantly grey plumage, with a flattened dark crest and black [[flight feather]]s and thighs.\n\nBreeding can take place at any time of year, but tends to be late in the dry season. The nest is built at the top of a thorny tree, and a clutch of one to three eggs is laid. In years with plentiful food all three young can survive to fledging. The secretarybird hunts and catches prey on the ground, often stomping on victims to kill them. Rodents and grasshoppers likely form the bulk of its diet, though it does kill snakes. \n\nAlthough the secretarybird occurs over a very large range, anecdotal observations and the results of localised surveys suggest that the total population is experiencing a rapid decline, probably as a result of habitat degradation. The species is therefore classed as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]]. The secretarybird appears on the [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] of [[Emblem of Sudan|Sudan]] and [[Coat of arms of South Africa|South Africa]].\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n{{Cladogram\n|caption=Position of the secretarybird in the order [[Accipitriformes]].<ref name=hackett2008/><ref name=ioc/>\n|align=right\n|cladogram={{Cladex| style=font-size:80%;line-height:75%;width:340px;\n|1={{clade\n   |1=[[Cathartidae]] \u2013 New World vultures (7 species)\n   |2={{clade\n      |1=[[Sagittariidae]] \u2013 '''Secretarybird'''\n      |2={{clade\n         |1={{clade\n            |1=[[Pandionidae]] \u2013 Ospreys (2 species)\n            |2=[[Accipitridae]] \u2013 Kites, hawks and eagles (256 species)\n            }}\n         }}\n      }}\n   }}\n  }}\n}}\nThe German biologist Ragnar Kinzelbach has proposed that the secretarybird was depicted as ''bistarda deserti'' in the 13th century work ''[[De arte venandi cum avibus]]'' penned by Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]. He most likely gained knowledge of the bird from sources in Egypt. The 16th century French priest and traveller [[Andr\u00e9 Thevet]] also wrote a description of a mysterious bird in 1558 that has been likened by Kinzelbach to the species.<ref name=kinzelbach>{{cite journal |last1=Kinzelbach |first1=Ragnar K. |title=Pre-Linnaean pictures of the secretarybird, ''Sagittarius serpentarius'' (J.

The two species, from the [[Oligocene]] and [[Miocene]] respectively, were not discovered in Africa but France. The feet in these fossils are more like those of the Accipitridae; it is suggested that these characteristics are primitive features within the family.

This short time of contact suggests that the secretarybird relies on superior visual targeting to determine the precise location of the prey's head. Although little is known about its visual field, it is assumed that it is large, frontal and binocular. Secretarybirds have unusually long legs (nearly twice as long as other ground birds of the same body mass), which is thought to be an adaptation for the bird's unique stomping/striking hunting method. However, these long limbs appear to also lower its running efficiency. It has been hypothesised that secretarybirds may have employed a similar hunting technique to the extinct [[Phorusrhacidae]] because they are anatomically similar (although they are not closely related.<ref name=portugal /><!-- cites previous 6 sentences -->\n\nSecretarybirds rarely encounter other predators, expect in the case of [[tawny eagle]]s which will [[Kleptoparasitism|steal their kills]].

[[Endemic (ecology)|Endemic]] to [[Africa]], it is usually found in the open grasslands and savannah of the [[Sub-Saharan Africa|sub-Saharan region]]. [[John Frederick Miller]] described the species in 1779. Although a member of the order [[Accipitriformes]], which also includes many other [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]] birds of prey such as [[kite (bird)|kites]], [[hawk]]s, [[vulture]]s, and [[harrier (bird)|harriers]], it is placed in its own family, [[Sagittariidae]]. The secretarybird is instantly recognisable as a very large bird with an eagle-like body on [[crane (bird)|crane-like]] legs which increases the bird's height to as much as {{convert|1.3|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The sexes are similar in appearance. Adults have a featherless red-orange face and predominantly grey plumage, with a flattened dark crest and black [[flight feather]]s and thighs.\n\nBreeding can take place at any time of year, but tends to be late in the dry season. The nest is built at the top of a thorny tree, and a clutch of one to three eggs is laid. In years with plentiful food all three young can survive to fledging. The secretarybird hunts and catches prey on the ground, often stomping on victims to kill them. Rodents and grasshoppers likely form the bulk of its diet, though it does kill snakes. \n\nAlthough the secretarybird occurs over a very large range, anecdotal observations and the results of localised surveys suggest that the total population is experiencing a rapid decline, probably as a result of habitat degradation. The species is therefore classed as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]]. The secretarybird appears on the [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] of [[Emblem of Sudan|Sudan]] and [[Coat of arms of South Africa|South Africa]].\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n{{Cladogram\n|caption=Position of the secretarybird in the order [[Accipitriformes]].<ref name=hackett2008/><ref name=ioc/>\n|align=right\n|cladogram={{Cladex| style=font-size:80%;line-height:75%;width:340px;\n|1={{clade\n   |1=[[Cathartidae]] \u2013 New World vultures (7 species)\n   |2={{clade\n      |1=[[Sagittariidae]] \u2013 '''Secretarybird'''\n      |2={{clade\n         |1={{clade\n            |1=[[Pandionidae]] \u2013 Ospreys (2 species)\n            |2=[[Accipitridae]] \u2013 Kites, hawks and eagles (256 species)\n            }}\n         }}\n      }}\n   }}\n  }}\n}}\nThe German biologist Ragnar Kinzelbach has proposed that the secretarybird was depicted as ''bistarda deserti'' in the 13th century work ''[[De arte venandi cum avibus]]'' penned by Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]].

The earliest [[fossil]]s associated with the family are two species from the genus ''[[Pelargopappus]]''. The two species, from the [[Oligocene]] and [[Miocene]] respectively, were not discovered in Africa but France. The feet in these fossils are more like those of the Accipitridae; it is suggested that these characteristics are primitive features within the family.

This short time of contact suggests that the secretarybird relies on superior visual targeting to determine the precise location of the prey's head. Although little is known about its visual field, it is assumed that it is large, frontal and binocular. Secretarybirds have unusually long legs (nearly twice as long as other ground birds of the same body mass), which is thought to be an adaptation for the bird's unique stomping/striking hunting method. However, these long limbs appear to also lower its running efficiency.
