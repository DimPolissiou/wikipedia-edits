It is located near two larger towns, 12 km south of [[Butwal]] and 10&nbsp;km north of [[Bhairahawa]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Bhalwari'' derives from the word ''bhal'' in [[Nepali language|Nepali]], the Nepalese language, and means \"force of the water\". The settlement was named as such because it experienced frequent flooding in the past.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==Population==\nMost of the population consists of [[Pahari people|Pahadi]] people who migrated from nearby villages. <!-- This is removed because it can not be understood\n... in the hills, students, and ex-Gurkha soldiers who are commonly called [[Lahure]] ({{lang-ne|\u0932\u093e\u0939\u0941\u0930\u0947}}). --> The settlement also has a significant number of [[Madhesi people|Madhesi]] people.\n\n==Culture and religion==\nThe majority of the population of Bhalwari trace their ancestry to nearby hilly regions of [[Palpa District|Palpa]], [[Arghakhanchi]], and [[Syangja]]. Because of this, Butwal's culture is significantly influenced by the [[Pahari people|Pahadi]]. The population is predominantly [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]]. The majority of the people are [[Gurung people|Gurung]], [[Tharu people|Tharu]], [[Thakuri]], [[Brahmin|Brahman]], [[Chhetri]], and [[Magars|Magar]]. There are some [[Muslims]], as well, who are of [[Madhesi people|Madhesi]] origin.\n\nThe major festivals celebrated are [[Holi]], [[Teej]], [[Maha Shivratri]], [[Losar]], [[Dashain]], [[Tihar (festival)|Tihar]] and [[Bhai Tika]]. Since the majority of the population are from nearby villages, most of them go to their native villages during the month-long festivities. From [[Dashain]] to [[Tihar (festival)|Tihar]], the town becomes nearly deserted.\n\n==Economy==\nThe main economy of the Bhalwari is agriculture and small-scale industries. There is one oil store, [[Nepal Oil Corporation]], which has 4 large tanks. There are many rice mills, including Siddhababa Rice Mill, Siddhartha Rice Mill, Om Shiva Rice Mill, Deurali Rice Mill, Pathak Rice Mill, and PnP general stores.\n\nThere are other medium-scale industries, such as the JK Soap & Cosmetics and Siddhababa Distillery. There are one commercial bank, two development banks, and several co-operatives. [[Nabil Bank]] is one of these commercial banks. Bhrikutee Development Bank and Purnima Development Bank have Class B banking licenses from [[Nepal Rastra Bank]].\n\n==Transportation==\nAs in most of [[Nepal]], buses are the major means of transportation, with many private operators running bus services between popular destinations. Until 2003, most of the bus fleet was made up of large, old buses. Since then, operators have purchased newer, smaller buses, commonly called [[Microbus|Micro]] because of their small size. There is frequent Micro service between Butwal and Bhairahawa. Older vehicles are also used to ferry people to nearby hilly regions. Apart from this, [[rickshaws]] are also a popular means of transport and can be found in abundance in Bhalwari. There are also many taxies, making it is easier to go anywhere, day or night. Bicycles, motorbikes, and cars are also common means of personal transportation around town.\n\n==Education==\nThere are several educational institutions in Bhalwari. There are five private primary level schools and one government school. The main educational institution of the town is [[Lumbini Engineering College]]. It is the only engineering college in the [[Lumbini]] zone. Other Private Schools include Araniko English High School, St. Joseph, Little Paradise, and one Montessori school, Pioneer Kids Montessori.\n\n[[Category:Populated places in Rupandehi District]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n<!--See the Table at Infobox settlement for all fields and descriptions of usage-->\n<!-- Basic info  -->\n|name          = Bhalwari\n|other_name             =\n|native_name            =  \u092d\u0932\u0935\u093e\u0930\u0940 \n|nickname               = \n|settlement_type        = Tilottama Municipality, Ward No: 9\n|motto                  =\n<!-- images and maps  -->\n|image_skyline          = \n|image_caption          = \n|image_flag             = \n|image_seal             = \n|image_map              = <!-- NepalRupandehiDistrictmap.png -->\n|map_caption            = Map of Rupandehi District.

A native of [[New Bern, North Carolina]], Mann played [[college football]] at [[Hampton University|Hampton Institute]] in 1942 and 1943 and at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1944, 1946 and 1947. Playing the [[End (American football)|end]] position, he broke the [[Big Ten Conference]] record for receiving yardage in 1946 and 1947. After going undrafted in the [[1948 NFL Draft]], Mann signed his first professional football contract with the [[Detroit Lions]], where he played for two seasons. He later played for the [[Green Bay Packers]] for parts of five seasons until 1954. Mann was the first African American player for both teams.\n\nMann led the NFL in receiving yardage (1,014 yards) and yards per reception (15.4) in 1949. Mann was asked to take a pay cut after the 1949 season and became a hold out when the Lions opened practice in July 1950. He was traded to the [[New York Yanks]] in August 1950 and released three weeks later. Mann charged that he had been \"railroaded\" out of professional football for refusing to take a pay cut. He signed with the Green Bay Packers near the end of the [[1950 NFL season]] and was the team's leading receiver in 1951. He remained with the Packers through the 1954 season. After his football career, Mann became a lawyer and practiced law in [[Detroit]]. He was inducted into the [[Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame]] in 1988 and died in October 2006 at the age of 82.\n\n==Early years==\nBob Mann was born in [[New Bern, North Carolina|New Bern]], the county seat of [[Craven County, North Carolina]], in 1924.<ref name=NB>{{cite news |last=Bryant|first=Arabelle|title=New Bern's Mann established several sports firsts |newspaper=[[Sun Journal (New Bern, North Carolina)|Sun Journal]]|date=January 16, 2010 |access-date=November 21, 2019 |url=http://www.newbernsj.com/news/mann-59214-bern-new.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100119021815/http://www.newbernsj.com/news/mann-59214-bern-new.html |archive-date=January 19, 2010 }}</ref> At the time of his childhood, New Bern was a small town of about 10,000 and was still segregated.<ref name=\"PIONEER\">{{Cite news | first = Bill| last = Dow| title = Mann pioneer player in NFL: Part 2| date = January 11, 2002| access-date = November 22, 2019| url-status=live |newspaper = [[Detroit Free Press]]| page = 8D| url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24262964/mann_end_was_one_of_1st_black_lions/| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20191122153540/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24262964/mann_end_was_one_of_1st_black_lions/| archive-date = November 22, 2019| via = [[Newspapers.com]]|type=clipping}}</ref> His father, William Mann, was a physician, and his mother, Clara Mann, was a supervisor of Craven County elementary schools.

A native of [[New Bern, North Carolina]], Mann played [[college football]] at [[Hampton University|Hampton Institute]] in 1942 and 1943 and at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1944, 1946 and 1947. Playing the [[End (American football)|end]] position, he broke the [[Big Ten Conference]] record for receiving yardage in 1946 and again in 1947. After going undrafted in the [[1948 NFL Draft]], Mann signed his first professional football contract with the [[Detroit Lions]], where he played for two seasons. He later played for the [[Green Bay Packers]] for parts of five seasons until 1954. Mann was the first African American player for both teams.\n\nMann led the NFL in receiving yardage (1,014 yards) and yards per reception (15.4) in 1949. Mann was asked to take a pay cut after the 1949 season and became a hold out when the Lions opened practice in July 1950. He was traded to the [[New York Yanks]] in August 1950 and released three weeks later. Mann charged that he had been \"railroaded\" out of professional football for refusing to take a pay cut. He signed with the Green Bay Packers near the end of the [[1950 NFL season]] and was the team's leading receiver in 1951. He remained with the Packers through the 1954 season. After his football career, Mann became a lawyer and practiced law in [[Detroit]]. He was inducted into the [[Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame]] in 1988 and died in October 2006 at the age of 82.\n\n==Early years==\nBob Mann was born in [[New Bern, North Carolina|New Bern]], the county seat of [[Craven County, North Carolina]], in 1924.<ref name=NB>{{cite news |last=Bryant|first=Arabelle|title=New Bern's Mann established several sports firsts |newspaper=[[Sun Journal (New Bern, North Carolina)|Sun Journal]]|date=January 16, 2010 |access-date=November 21, 2019 |url=http://www.newbernsj.com/news/mann-59214-bern-new.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100119021815/http://www.newbernsj.com/news/mann-59214-bern-new.html |archive-date=January 19, 2010 }}</ref> At the time of his childhood, New Bern was a small town of about 10,000 and was still segregated.<ref name=\"PIONEER\">{{Cite news | first = Bill| last = Dow| title = Mann pioneer player in NFL: Part 2| date = January 11, 2002| access-date = November 22, 2019| url-status=live |newspaper = [[Detroit Free Press]]| page = 8D| url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24262964/mann_end_was_one_of_1st_black_lions/| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20191122153540/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24262964/mann_end_was_one_of_1st_black_lions/| archive-date = November 22, 2019| via = [[Newspapers.com]]|type=clipping}}</ref> His father, William Mann, was a physician, and his mother, Clara Mann, was a supervisor of Craven County elementary schools.
