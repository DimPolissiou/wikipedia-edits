He was ordered to lead a company of troops to quell rioters in [[Senen|Pasar Senen]] in Central Jakarta. He said the rioters, who were no longer student protesters, began throwing stones at his troops. Luhut responded by ordering his men to fire warning shots, but he said this had no effect on the rioters. He then ordered his men to shoot at the legs of the rioters, and he suspected several were killed in the ensuing chaos as troops were not equipped with rubber bullets. His men chased the rioters to Jalan Juanda, to Glodok and even to the [[Kramat Tunggak]] brothel complex in North Jakarta, where Luhut arrested human rights activist [[Poncke Princen|Johannes Cornelis Princen]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Tentara Bingung Demonstran Tak Terbendung |url=https://majalah.tempo.co/read/144459/tentara-bingung-demonstran-tak-terbendung?hidden=login |accessdate=16 January 2020 |publisher=Tempo.co |date=13 January 2014}}</ref> \n\nLuhut served four times in [[East Timor]], first as a 28-year-old in the December 1975 [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|Indonesian invasion]] force. At that time he held the rank of first lieutenant and was the commander of Combat Detachment A Company (Denpur) in the Sandi Yudha Troop Command (Kopassandha, later Kopassus), led by Major Atang Sutisna. Around midnight on 7 December 1975, eight [[C-130B Hercules]] departed from [[Magetan]], East Java, and six hours later reached [[Dili]] airspace. The Indonesian soldiers began to parachute in but were met by a barrage of anti-aircraft fire.

{"title_page": "Prophecy of Seventy Weeks", "text_new": "{{short description|In the Bible, a prophecy given to Daniel by the angel Gabriel}}\n{{Daniel chapters}}\nIn the Bible, the  '''Prophecy of Seventy Weeks''' (chapter 9 of the [[Book of Daniel]]) is a [[prophecy]] given to [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] by the angel [[Gabriel]] in response to Daniel's prayer for God to act on behalf of [[people of God|his people]] and city (i.e. [[Jerusalem]]). The angel informs him that seventy \"weeks\" have been decreed for them, and then gives a detailed but cryptic description of those weeks.\n\nThe prophecy has proved notoriously difficult for readers,{{sfn|Tanner|2009a|p=181}} despite it having been the subject of \"intense exegetical activity\" since the [[Second Temple period]].{{sfn|Segal|2011|loc=p. 293 n. 31}} For this reason scholars continue to follow [[James Alan Montgomery]] in referring to the history of this prophecy's interpretation as the \"dismal swamp\" of critical [[exegesis]].{{sfn|Montgomery|1927|p=400}}{{sfn|Meadowcroft|2001}}{{sfn|Athas|2009|p=2}}\n\n== Summary ==\n\nDaniel reads in the \"books\" that the desolation of Jerusalem must last for seventy years according to the prophetic words of [[Jeremiah]] (verse 2), and prays for God to act on behalf of his people and city (verses 3\u201319). The angel Gabriel appears and tells Daniel that he has come to give wisdom and understanding, for at the beginning of Daniel's prayer a \"word\" went out and Gabriel has come to declare this [[revelation]] (verses 20\u201323):\n\n{{quote|{{sup|24}}Seventy weeks are decreed for your people and your holy city: to finish the transgression, to put an end to sin, and to atone for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal both vision and prophet, and to anoint a most holy place. \n{{sup|25}}Know therefore and understand: from the time that the word went out to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the time of an anointed prince, there shall be seven weeks; and for sixty-two weeks it shall be built again with streets and moat, but in a troubled time.\n\n{{sup|26}}After the sixty-two weeks, an anointed one shall be cut off and shall have nothing, and the troops of the prince who is to come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. Its end shall come with a flood, and to the end there shall be war. Desolations are decreed. \n{{sup|27}}He shall make a strong covenant with many for one week, and for half of the week he shall make sacrifice and offering cease; and in their place shall be an abomination that desolates, until the decreed end is poured out upon the desolator.|{{bibleref2|Daniel|9:24\u201327 (NRSV)|NRSV}}}}\n\n== Composition and structure ==\n[[File:Archangel Gabriel. Tsalenjikha fresco (Georgia, 14th c.).jpg|thumb|right|215 px|Gabriel. A 14th-century fresco from the [[Tsalenjikha Cathedral]] by Cyrus Emanuel Eugenicus.]]\n\n=== Chapter outline ===\n\nThe consensus among critical scholars is that chapters 1\u20136 of the [[Book of Daniel]] originated as a collection of [[Folklore#Folktales|folktales]] among the [[Jewish diaspora]] in the [[Persian period|Persian]]/[[Hellenistic period#Judea|Hellenistic periods]], to which the visionary chapters 7\u201312 were added during the persecution of the Jews under [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes|Antiochus IV]] in 167\u2013163 BCE.{{sfn|Collins|1993|pp=35\u201337, 60\u201361}} The authors of the tales apparently took the name Daniel from a legendary hero mentioned in the [[Book of Ezekiel]], and the author of the visions in turn adopted him from the tales.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=1}}{{sfn|Collins|1999|p=220}}\n\n[[Old Testament]] scholar [[John J. Collins]] observes that chapter 9 can be distinguished from the second half of the Book of Daniel by the following two facts: (1) the point of departure for the chapter is another biblical text in Jeremiah's seventy years prophecy as opposed to a visionary episode, and (2) more than half the chapter is devoted to a rather lengthy prayer.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=347}} Accordingly, Collins divides the chapter into an introductory section that mentions Daniel's reading of Jeremiah's prophecy (verses 1\u20132), the penitential prayer given by Daniel (verses 3\u201319), and the prophecy given by the angel Gabriel following the aforementioned prayer (verses 20\u201327)\u2014with a more detailed outline given below:{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=347}}\n\n{{ordered list|type=upper-roman\n  | Verses 1\u20132.

(verses 24\u201327).\n    }}\n  }}\n}}\n\n=== Daniel's prayer ===\n\nModern critical scholars have sometimes argued that Daniel's prayer in verses 3\u201319 is secondary to chapter 9,{{sfn|Gall|1895|pp=123\u201326}}{{sfn|Hartman|Di Lella|1978|pp=245\u201346}} as it contrasts sharply with the difficult Hebrew that is characteristic of Daniel.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=347}} Still, it might be that the author(s) of the chapter incorporated (or adapted) a traditional prayer in the course of composition, in which case the prayer would not be a later addition.{{sfn|Montgomery|1927|p=362}} Proponents of the view that the prayer is secondary argue that (1) the context requires a prayer of illumination and not a communal confession of sin, and (2) the beginning and end of the prayer are marked by duplications in verses 3-4a and verses 20-21a that are most plausibly interpreted as redactional seams.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=347}} However, these considerations have not proved decisive,{{sfn|Goldingay|1989|p=237}} and arguments in favor of the prayer's authenticity have also been advanced.{{sfn|Jones|1968}} In particular, the concluding passage in verses 20\u201327 contains several allusions to the language in the prayer, suggesting that it was included purposefully by the author(s) of the chapter, even if it was not originally composed by them.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=348}}\n\n=== Gabriel's revelation ===\n\nIt has also been argued that there is a \"pre-Maccabean core\" to the prophetic revelation delivered by Gabriel in verses 24\u201327,{{sfn|Laato|1990}}{{sfn|Segal|2011|loc=p. 294 n. 32}} and that certain linguistic inconsistencies between the seventy weeks prophecy and other Danielic passages suggest that the second century BCE author(s)/redactor(s) of the Book of Daniel took over and modified a preexisting [[oracle]] that was already in circulation at the time of composition.{{sfn|Grabbe|1987}} These ideas have been further developed to suggest that the different [[redaction]]al layers represented in this text reflect different [[eschatology|eschatological]] perspectives,{{sfn|Waters|2016|pp=97\u2013107}} with the earliest one going back to a priest named Daniel who accompanied Ezra from Babylon to Jerusalem in the fifth century BCE and the latest one to an unnamed redactor who edited this prophecy in the second century BCE so that it would function (along with other parts of the Book of Daniel) as part of \"a prophetic manifesto for world domination.\"{{sfn|Waters|2016|pp=110\u2013111}} It is also argued that the prophecy exhibited a high degree of literary structure at an earlier stage of its development in such a way that the six infinitival clauses of verse 24 were [[Chiastic structure|chiastically]] linked to six divisions of verses 25\u201327 via an elaborate system of word counts, resulting in the following reconstruction of this earlier redactional stratum:{{sfn|Waters|2016|pp=98\u2013100}}\n\n{| align=\"center\"\n|+ Seventy Weeks\n|-\n| A{{in5}}To withhold the rebellion.\n|-\n| {{in5}}B{{in5}}To seal up sins.\n|-\n| {{in5|10}}C{{in5}}To atone

periodized form whose ''[[Sitz im Leben]]'' is the [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes#Sacking of Jerusalem and persecution of Jews|Antiochene crisis]] in the second century BCE, with content analogous to the [[Book of Enoch|Enochic]] ''Apocalypse of Weeks'' as well as the ''Animal Apocalypse''.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=359}} In this way, the prophecy puts the Antiochene crisis in perspective by locating it within an overview of history;{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=360}} the specificity of the prediction is significant for the psychological effect of the revelation, which has long been recognized as a distinctive characteristic of Daniel's prophecies (cf. ''Ant.'' 10.11.7 \u00a7&nbsp;267).{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=360}}{{sfn|Waters|2016|loc=p. 98 n. 15}} The prophecy is also an instance of [[Apocalyptic literature#Old Testament|Jewish apocalyptic literature]], as it belongs to the genre of revelatory literature in which a revelation is mediated to a human recipient in Daniel by an otherworldly being in the angel Gabriel that envisages [[Eschatology|eschatological]] salvation.{{sfn|Collins|1993|pp=54\u201355}} Within the macro-genre of Jewish apocalyptic literature, the prophecy further belongs to the subgenre known as the \"historical apocalypse,\" which is characterized by the use of ''ex eventu'' prophecy and the presence of an interpreting angel.{{sfn|Collins|1993|pp=54\u201355}}\n\nThe lengthy prayer in verses 3\u201319 is strongly [[Deuteronomist|Deuteronomic]] in its theology\u2014Daniel's people are punished for their own sin and appeal to God for mercy.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=359}} However, such theological overtones conflict with other aspects of the Book of Daniel, in which the primary sin is that of a gentile king and the course of history is arranged in advance.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=359}} Consequently, scholars have variously argued that the angel ignores Daniel's prayer and that the author(s) is making the point that \"the calamity is decreed and will end at the appointed time, quite apart from prayers,\"{{sfn|Jones|1968|p=493}} and/or that the prayer is not intended to influence God but is \"an act of piety in itself.\"{{sfn|Towner|1971|p=213}}{{sfn|Collins|1993|pp=359\u201360}} As Collins observes, \"[t]he deliverance promised by the angel is in no sense a response to Daniel's prayer\" since \"[t]he word goes forth at the beginning of Daniel's supplication.\"{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=360}} In any case, the relationship between Daniel's prayer and the context in which it is placed, is a central issue in the contemporary scholarly interpretation of chapter 9.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=359}}\n\n== Historical-critical analysis ==\n=== Historical background ===\n\n[[Nebuchadnezzar II]] defeated Egypt at the [[Battle of Carchemish]] in 605 BCE and established [[Neo-Babylonian empire|Babylon]] as the dominant regional power, with significant consequences for the southern kingdom of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]. Following a revolt in 597 BCE, Nebuchadnezzar removed Judah's king, [[Jeconiah|Jehoiachin]]; and after a second revolt in 586 BCE, he destroyed the city of Jerusalem along with the [[Solomon's Temple|Temple of Solomon]], carrying away much of the population to Babylon.{{sfn|Levine|2010|p=173}} Accordingly, the subsequent period from 586 BCE to 538 BCE is known as the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian exile]],{{sfn|Levine|2010|p=36}} which came to an end when Babylon was conquered by the Persian king [[Cyrus the Great]], who allowed the Jewish exiles to return to Judah via his famous [[Cyrus's edict|edict of restoration]]. The Persian period, in turn, came to an end in the first half of the fourth century BCE following the arrival of [[Alexander the Great]], whose vast kingdom was divided upon his death among the [[Diadochi]]. The series of conflicts that ensued following Alexander's death in the [[Wars of the Diadochi|wars]] that erupted among the Diadochi mark the beginning of the Hellenistic period in 323/2 BCE. Two of the rival kingdoms produced out of this conflict\u2014the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] in Egypt and the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid dynasty]] in Syria\u2014fought for control of Palestine during the Hellenistic period.{{sfn|Levine|2010|pp=25\u201326}}\n\nAt the start of the second century BCE, the Seleucids had the upper hand in their struggle with the Ptolemaic kingdom for regional dominance, but the earlier conflicts had left them nearly bankrupt. The Seleucid ruler Antiochus IV attempted to recoup some of his kingdom's fortunes by selling the post of Jewish high priest to the highest bidder, and in 171/0 BCE the existing high priest (i.e. [[Onias III]]) was deposed and murdered. Palestine was subsequently divided between those who favored the Hellenistic culture of the Seleucids and those who remained loyal to the older Jewish traditions; however, for reasons that are still not understood, Antiochus IV banned key aspects of traditional Jewish religion in 168/7 BCE\u2014including the twice-daily continual offering (cf. {{bibleverse|Daniel|8:13|KJV}}; {{bibleverse-nb|Daniel|11:31|KJV}}; {{bibleverse-nb|Daniel|12:11|KJV}}).{{sfn|Lust|2002|pp=672\u201373}}\n\n=== Context within chapter 9 ===\n\n[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn - Jeremia treurend over de verwoesting van Jeruzalem - Google Art Project.jpg|200px|right|thumbnail|[[Rembrandt van Rijn]], \"Jeremiah Lamenting the Destruction of Jerusalem\", c. 1630.]]\n\nThe seventy weeks prophecy is internally dated to \"the first year of Darius son of Ahasuerus, by birth a Mede\" (verse 1), elsewhere referred to within the Book of Daniel as \"[[Darius the Mede]]\" (e.g. {{bibleverse|Daniel|11:1|KJV}}); however, no such ruler is known to history independently of the Book of Daniel and the widespread consensus among critical scholars is that he is a literary fiction.{{sfn|Rowley|1935|pp=12\u201366}} Nevertheless, within the fictionalized biblical account, the first year of Darius the Mede corresponds to the first year after the Babylonian kingdom is overthrown, i.e., 538 BCE.{{sfn|Segal|2011|p=289}}{{sfn|Waters|2016|p=97}}\n\nChapter 9 can be distinguished from the other \"visionary\" chapters of the Book of Daniel by the fact that the point of departure for this chapter is another biblical text in Jeremiah's seventy years prophecy and not a visionary episode.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=347}} The longstanding consensus among critical scholars has been that verses 24\u201327 is a paradigmatic example of inner-biblical interpretation, in which the latter text reinterprets Jeremiah's seventy years of exile as seventy weeks of years.{{sfn|Segal|2011|p=283}} On this view, Jeremiah's prophecy that after seventy years God would punish the Babylonian kingdom (cf. [[Jeremiah 25:12|Jer 25:12]]) and once again pay special attention to his people in responding to their prayers and restoring them to the land (cf. [[Jeremiah 29:10|Jer 29:10]]-14) could not have been fulfilled by the disappointment that accompanied the return to the land in the Persian period, hence the necessity to extend the expiration date of the prophecy to the second century BCE.{{sfn|Grabbe|1987|pp=67\u201372}}{{sfn|Segal|2011|p=283}} And just as various elements of Daniel's visionary episodes are interpreted for him in chapters 7\u20138, so also Jeremiah's prophecy is interpreted for him in a manner similar to the ''[[pesher]]'' exegesis evidenced at [[Qumran]] in chapter 9.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=359}}{{sfn|Segal|2011|p=284}} However, this consensus has recently been challenged on the grounds that Daniel prays to God following the defeat of the Babylonian kingdom precisely because Jeremiah's seventy years of exile have been completed and God promised through the prophet that he would respond to such prayers at this time,{{sfn|Waters|2016|p=97}} in which case the seventy weeks prophecy is not a reinterpretation of Jeremiah's prophecy but a separate prophecy altogether.{{sfn|Bergsma|2006|pp=212\u201325}}{{sfn|Segal|2011|pp=288\u201392, 302}} And these considerations have been further refined along redactional lines to suggest that the latter holds relative to an earlier \"pre-canonical\" stage in the text, but that the seventy weeks prophecy is, in fact, a reinterpretation of Jeremiah's prophecy relative to the final form of the text.{{sfn|Waters|2016|pp=97\u2013107}}\n\n=== The seventy weeks prophecy ===\n\nThe seventy \"weeks\" of years are divided into three periods of time: a seven-week period spanning forty-nine years, a sixty-two-week period spanning 434 years, and a final period of one week spanning seven years.{{sfn|Montgomery|1927|p=391}}{{sfn|Segal|2011|p=293}} The first period of seven weeks begins with the departure of a \"word\" to rebuild Jerusalem and ends with the arrival of an \"anointed prince\" (verse 25a). This \"word\" to rebuild Jerusalem has generally been taken to refer to Jeremiah's seventy years prophecy and dated to the fourth year of [[Jehoiakim]] (or the first year of [[Nebuchadnezzar]]) in 605/4 BCE.{{sfn|Koch|1980|p=150}}{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=354}} Collins objects to this identification on the basis that \"[t]he word to rebuild Jerusalem could scarcely have gone forth before it was destroyed\" and prefers to see this as a reference to the \"word\" that Gabriel came to give Daniel in verse 23;{{sfn|Collins|1993|pp=354\u201355}} other possible candidates suggested by critical scholars include the edict of Cyrus in 539/8 BCE,{{sfn|Hess|2011|p=317}}{{sfn|Waters|2016|pp=100\u2013101}} the decree of [[Artaxerxes I of Persia|Artaxerxes I]] in 458/7 BCE,{{sfn|Redditt|2000|p=238}}{{sfn|Waters|2016|pp=100\u2013101}} and the warrant given to [[Nehemiah]] in 445/4 BCE.{{sfn|Goldingay|1989|p=260}}{{sfn|Redditt|2000|p=238}} The \"prince\" in verse 25a may refer to either an actual prince or some other figure of authority and critical scholars have proposed various candidates here as well, including Cyrus (cf.

Hence, some critical scholars follow Montgomery in thinking that there has been \"a chronological miscalculation on [the] part of the writer,\"{{sfn|Montgomery|1927|p=393}} who is then criticized for making \"wrong-headed arithmetical calculations;\"{{sfn|Porteous|1965|p=134}} while others like [[John Goldingay|Goldingay]] are not inclined to see this as a \"chronological miscalculation\" on the basis that the seventy weeks are not an exercise in literal chronology, but the more inexact science of \"chronography.\"{{sfn|Goldingay|1989|pp=257\u201358}}{{sfn|Segal|2011|p=298}} Collins opts for something like a middle-ground position in saying that \"the figure should be considered a round number rather than a miscalculation.\"{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=356}} And there are still others who see the calculations as being at least approximately correct so long as the initial seven-week period of forty-nine years can overlap with the sixty-two-week period of 434 years, with the latter period spanning the time between Jeremiah's prophecy in 605/4 BCE and Onias III's murder in 171/0 BCE.{{sfn|Athas|2009|pp=16\u201317}}{{sfn|Waters|2016|p=106}}\n\n[[File:AntiochusIVEpiphanes.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Coin of Antiochus IV.

Dan 11:31; 1 Macc 1:29\u201340) or the Jewish [[hellenizer]]s.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=357}}{{sfn|Seow|2003|p=150}} In any case, the reference to \"troops\" that will \"destroy the city and the sanctuary\" in verse 26b is somewhat problematic on this view since neither Jerusalem nor the temple were actually destroyed during the Antiochene crisis,{{sfn|Hess|2011|p=328}} though the city was arguably rendered desolate and the temple defiled (cf. 1 Macc 1:46; 2 Macc 6:2).{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=357}}{{sfn|Hess|2011|p=328}} Accordingly, it has been noted that the language of destruction \"seems excessive\" in this context.{{sfn|Towner|1984|p=143}}\n\nThe \"covenant\" in verse 27a most likely refers to the \"covenant\" reported in 1 Maccabees 1:11 between the Jewish hellenizers and Antiochus IV,{{sfn|Goldingay|1989|p=262}}{{sfn|Waters|2016|pp=106\u2013107}} with the ban on regular worship for a period that lasted approximately three and a half years alluded to in the subsequent clause (cf. Dan 7:25; 8:14; 12:11).{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=357}}{{sfn|Lust|2002|p=683}} In contrast, the reference to an \"[[Abomination of desolation|abomination that desolates]]\" in verse 27b (cf. 1 Macc 1:54) is another point of contention among critical scholars. One of the more popular older views was that this difficult phrase was a contemptuous deformation (or [[dysphemism]]) of the [[Phoenician religion|Phoenician deity]] [[Baalshamin|Baal Shamin]]\u2014the \"Lord of Heaven\"\u2014whom [[Philo of Byblos]] identified with the Greek [[sky god]] [[Zeus]].{{sfn|Lust|2002|pp=674}} Moreover, the temple in Jerusalem was rededicated in honor of Zeus according to [[2 Maccabees]] 6:2, hence the tendency among older commentators to follow [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] in seeing this \"abomination\" in terms of a statue of Zeus.{{sfn|Lust|2002|pp=677\u201378}} More recently, it has been suggested that the reference is to certain sacred stones (possibly [[meteorite]]s) that were affixed to the great [[Altar (Bible)|altar]] of sacrifice for the purposes of pagan worship in the temple,{{sfn|Porteous|1965|p=143}}{{sfn|Goldstein|1976|pp=144\u201351}} since the use of such stones is well-attested in [[Ancient Canaanite religion|Canaanite]] and Syrian cults.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=358}} However, both sorts of proposals have been criticized on the basis that they are either too speculative, dependent on flawed analysis, or not well-suited to the relevant context in the Book of Daniel.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=358}}{{sfn|Lust|2002|pp=675\u201382}} Increasingly, critical scholars tend to see the expression as being a reference to either the pagan offerings that were given during the Antiochene crisis instead of the twice-daily continual offering that had been forbidden (cf. Dan 11:31; 12:11; 2 Macc 6:5),{{sfn|Lust|2002|pp=682\u201387}}{{sfn|Waters|2016|p=107}} or the pagan altar on which such offerings were made.{{sfn|Goldingay|1989|p=263}}{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=358}}\n\n==Computations==\nRoger T.

The \"abomination that desolates\" is typically read in the context of the [[New Testament]] references made to this expression in the [[Olivet Discourse]] and understood as belonging to a complex eschatological tableaux described therein, which may or may not remain to be fulfilled.\n\nAnother influential way of reading the prophecy follows [[Sextus Julius Africanus|Africanus]] in identifying the warrant given to Nehemiah in 445/4 BCE as the ''terminus a quo''.{{sfn|Hess|2011|p=322}} 483 years from 445/4 BCE would extend somewhat beyond the lifetime of Christ to 39/40 CE, hence some Christological interpretations reduce the period to 476 years by viewing them as [[360-day calendar|360-day]] \"[[prophetic years]]\" (or \"Chaldee years\" {{sfn|Lloyd|1690|p=i}}), so-called on the basis that various biblical passages\u2014such as Revelation 12:6, 14 (cf. Dan 7:25; 12:7)\u2014appear to reckon time in this way in certain prophetic contexts.{{sfn|Hoehner|1978|pp=136\u201337}} The sixty-nine weeks of \"prophetic\" years are then considered to terminate with the death of Christ in 32/3 CE.{{sfn|Doukhan|1979|p=2}}{{sfn|Hoehner|1978|p=141}} The seventieth week is then separated from the sixty-ninth week by a long period of time known as the [[Dispensationalism#Start of the Church Age|church age]];{{sfn|Doukhan|1979|p=2}}{{sfn|Hess|2011|p=322}} hence, the seventieth week does not begin until the end of the church age, at which point the church will be removed from the earth in an event called the [[rapture]]. Finally, the future Antichrist is expected to oppress the Jewish people and bring upon the world a period of tribulation lasting three and a half years, constituting the second half of the delayed seventieth week. These readings were first popularized through the expository notes written by [[C. I.

The angel informs him that seventy \"weeks\" have been decreed for them, and then gives a detailed but cryptic description of those weeks.\n\nThe prophecy has proved notoriously difficult for readers,{{sfn|Tanner|2009a|p=181}} despite it having been the subject of \"intense exegetical activity\" since the [[Second Temple period]].{{sfn|Segal|2011|loc=p. 293 n. 31}} For this reason scholars continue to follow [[James Alan Montgomery]] in referring to the history of this prophecy's interpretation as the \"dismal swamp\" of critical [[exegesis]].{{sfn|Montgomery|1927|p=400}}{{sfn|Meadowcroft|2001}}{{sfn|Athas|2009|p=2}}\n\n== Summary ==\n\nDaniel reads in the \"books\" that the desolation of Jerusalem must last for seventy years according to the prophetic words of [[Jeremiah]] (verse 2), and prays for God to act on behalf of his people and city (verses 3\u201319). The angel Gabriel appears and tells Daniel that he has come to give wisdom and understanding, for at the beginning of Daniel's prayer a \"word\" went out and Gabriel has come to declare this [[revelation]] (verses 20\u201323):\n\n{{quote|{{sup|24}}Seventy weeks are decreed for your people and your holy city: to finish the transgression, to put an end to sin, and to atone for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal both vision and prophet, and to anoint a most holy place. \n{{sup|25}}Know therefore and understand: from the time that the word went out to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the time of an anointed prince, there shall be seven weeks; and for sixty-two weeks it shall be built again with streets and moat, but in a troubled time.\n\n{{sup|26}}After the sixty-two weeks, an anointed one shall be cut off and shall have nothing, and the troops of the prince who is to come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. Its end shall come with a flood, and to the end there shall be war. Desolations are decreed. \n{{sup|27}}He shall make a strong covenant with many for one week, and for half of the week he shall make sacrifice and offering cease; and in their place shall be an abomination that desolates, until the decreed end is poured out upon the desolator.|{{bibleref2|Daniel|9:24\u201327 (NRSV)|NRSV}}}}\n\n== Composition and structure ==\n[[File:Archangel Gabriel. Tsalenjikha fresco (Georgia, 14th c.).jpg|thumb|right|215 px|Gabriel. A 14th-century fresco from the [[Tsalenjikha Cathedral]] by Cyrus Emanuel Eugenicus.]]\n\n=== Chapter outline ===\n\nThe consensus among critical scholars is that chapters 1\u20136 of the [[Book of Daniel]] originated as a collection of [[Folklore#Folktales|folktales]] among the [[Jewish diaspora]] in the [[Persian period|Persian]]/[[Hellenistic period#Judea|Hellenistic periods]], to which the visionary chapters 7\u201312 were added during the persecution of the Jews under [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes|Antiochus IV]] in 167\u2013163 BCE.{{sfn|Collins|1993|pp=35\u201337, 60\u201361}} The authors of the tales apparently took the name Daniel from a legendary hero mentioned in the [[Book of Ezekiel]], and the author of the visions in turn adopted him from the tales.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=1}}{{sfn|Collins|1999|p=220}}\n\n[[Old Testament]] scholar [[John J. Collins]] observes that chapter 9 can be distinguished from the second half of the Book of Daniel by the following two facts: (1) the point of departure for the chapter is another biblical text in Jeremiah's seventy years prophecy as opposed to a visionary episode, and (2) more than half the chapter is devoted to a rather lengthy prayer.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=347}} Accordingly, Collins divides the chapter into an introductory section that mentions Daniel's reading of Jeremiah's prophecy (verses 1\u20132), the penitential prayer given by Daniel (verses 3\u201319), and the prophecy given by the angel Gabriel following the aforementioned prayer (verses 20\u201327)\u2014with a more detailed outline given below:{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=347}}\n\n{{ordered list|type=upper-roman\n  | Verses 1\u20132.

(verses 24\u201327).\n    }}\n  }}\n}}\n\n=== Daniel's prayer ===\n\nModern critical scholars have sometimes argued that Daniel's prayer in verses 3\u201319 is secondary to chapter 9,{{sfn|Gall|1895|pp=123\u201326}}{{sfn|Hartman|Di Lella|1978|pp=245\u201346}} as it contrasts sharply with the difficult Hebrew that is characteristic of Daniel.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=347}} Still, it might be that the author(s) of the chapter incorporated (or adapted) a traditional prayer in the course of composition, in which case the prayer would not be a later addition.{{sfn|Montgomery|1927|p=362}} Proponents of the view that the prayer is secondary argue that (1) the context requires a prayer of illumination and not a communal confession of sin, and (2) the beginning and end of the prayer are marked by duplications in verses 3-4a and verses 20-21a that are most plausibly interpreted as redactional seams.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=347}} However, these considerations have not proved decisive,{{sfn|Goldingay|1989|p=237}} and arguments in favor of the prayer's authenticity have also been advanced.{{sfn|Jones|1968}} In particular, the concluding passage in verses 20\u201327 contains several allusions to the language in the prayer, suggesting that it was included purposefully by the author(s) of the chapter, even if it was not originally composed by them.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=348}}\n\n=== Gabriel's revelation ===\n\nIt has also been argued that there is a \"pre-Maccabean core\" to the prophetic revelation delivered by Gabriel in verses 24\u201327,{{sfn|Laato|1990}}{{sfn|Segal|2011|loc=p. 294 n. 32}} and that certain linguistic inconsistencies between the seventy weeks prophecy and other Danielic passages suggest that the second century BCE author(s)/redactor(s) of the Book of Daniel took over and modified a preexisting [[oracle]] that was already in circulation at the time of composition.{{sfn|Grabbe|1987}} These ideas have been further developed to suggest that the different [[redaction]]al layers represented in this text reflect different [[eschatology|eschatological]] perspectives,{{sfn|Waters|2016|pp=97\u2013107}} with the earliest one going back to a priest named Daniel who accompanied Ezra from Babylon to Jerusalem in the fifth century BCE and the latest one to an unnamed redactor who edited this prophecy in the second century BCE so that it would function (along with other parts of the Book of Daniel) as part of \"a prophetic manifesto for world domination.\"{{sfn|Waters|2016|pp=110\u2013111}} It is also argued that the prophecy exhibited a high degree of literary structure at an earlier stage of its development in such a way that the six infinitival clauses of verse 24 were [[Chiastic structure|chiastically]] linked to six divisions of verses 25\u201327 via an elaborate system of word counts, resulting in the following reconstruction of this earlier redactional stratum:{{sfn|Waters|2016|pp=98\u2013100}}\n\n{| align=\"center\"\n|+ Seventy Weeks\n|-\n| A{{in5}}To withhold the rebellion.\n|-\n| {{in5}}B{{in5}}To seal up sins.\n|-\n| {{in5|10}}C{{in5}}To atone

periodized form whose ''[[Sitz im Leben]]'' is the [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes#Sacking of Jerusalem and persecution of Jews|Antiochene crisis]] in the second century BCE, with content analogous to the [[Book of Enoch|Enochic]] ''Apocalypse of Weeks'' as well as the ''Animal Apocalypse''.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=359}} In this way, the prophecy puts the Antiochene crisis in perspective by locating it within an overview of history;{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=360}} the specificity of the prediction is significant for the psychological effect of the revelation, which has long been recognized as a distinctive characteristic of Daniel's prophecies (cf. ''Ant.'' 10.11.7 \u00a7&nbsp;267).{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=360}}{{sfn|Waters|2016|loc=p. 98 n. 15}} The prophecy is also an instance of [[Apocalyptic literature#Old Testament|Jewish apocalyptic literature]], as it belongs to the genre of revelatory literature in which a revelation is mediated to a human recipient in Daniel by an otherworldly being in the angel Gabriel that envisages [[Eschatology|eschatological]] salvation.{{sfn|Collins|1993|pp=54\u201355}} Within the macro-genre of Jewish apocalyptic literature, the prophecy further belongs to the subgenre known as the \"historical apocalypse,\" which is characterized by the use of ''ex eventu'' prophecy and the presence of an interpreting angel.{{sfn|Collins|1993|pp=54\u201355}}\n\nThe lengthy prayer in verses 3\u201319 is strongly [[Deuteronomist|Deuteronomic]] in its theology\u2014Daniel's people are punished for their own sin and appeal to God for mercy.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=359}} However, such theological overtones conflict with other aspects of the Book of Daniel, in which the primary sin is that of a gentile king and the course of history is arranged in advance.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=359}} Consequently, scholars have variously argued that the angel ignores Daniel's prayer and that the author(s) is making the point that \"the calamity is decreed and will end at the appointed time, quite apart from prayers,\"{{sfn|Jones|1968|p=493}} and/or that the prayer is not intended to influence God but is \"an act of piety in itself.\"{{sfn|Towner|1971|p=213}}{{sfn|Collins|1993|pp=359\u201360}} As Collins observes, \"[t]he deliverance promised by the angel is in no sense a response to Daniel's prayer\" since \"[t]he word goes forth at the beginning of Daniel's supplication.\"{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=360}} In any case, the relationship between Daniel's prayer and the context in which it is placed, is a central issue in the contemporary scholarly interpretation of chapter 9.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=359}}\n\n== Historical-critical analysis ==\n=== Historical background ===\n\n[[Nebuchadnezzar II]] defeated Egypt at the [[Battle of Carchemish]] in 605 BCE and established [[Neo-Babylonian empire|Babylon]] as the dominant regional power, with significant consequences for the southern kingdom of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]. Following a revolt in 597 BCE, Nebuchadnezzar removed Judah's king, [[Jeconiah|Jehoiachin]]; and after a second revolt in 586 BCE, he destroyed the city of Jerusalem along with the [[Solomon's Temple|Temple of Solomon]], carrying away much of the population to Babylon.{{sfn|Levine|2010|p=173}} Accordingly, the subsequent period from 586 BCE to 538 BCE is known as the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian exile]],{{sfn|Levine|2010|p=36}} which came to an end when Babylon was conquered by the Persian king [[Cyrus the Great]], who allowed the Jewish exiles to return to Judah via his famous [[Cyrus's edict|edict of restoration]]. The Persian period, in turn, came to an end in the first half of the fourth century BCE following the arrival of [[Alexander the Great]], whose vast kingdom was divided upon his death among the [[Diadochi]]. The series of conflicts that ensued following Alexander's death in the [[Wars of the Diadochi|wars]] that erupted among the Diadochi mark the beginning of the Hellenistic period in 323/2 BCE. Two of the rival kingdoms produced out of this conflict\u2014the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] in Egypt and the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid dynasty]] in Syria\u2014fought for control of Palestine during the Hellenistic period.{{sfn|Levine|2010|pp=25\u201326}}\n\nAt the start of the second century BCE, the Seleucids had the upper hand in their struggle with the Ptolemaic kingdom for regional dominance, but the earlier conflicts had left them nearly bankrupt. The Seleucid ruler Antiochus IV attempted to recoup some of his kingdom's fortunes by selling the post of Jewish high priest to the highest bidder, and in 171/0 BCE the existing high priest (i.e. [[Onias III]]) was deposed and murdered. Palestine was subsequently divided between those who favored the Hellenistic culture of the Seleucids and those who remained loyal to the older Jewish traditions; however, for reasons that are still not understood, Antiochus IV banned key aspects of traditional Jewish religion in 168/7 BCE\u2014including the twice-daily continual offering (cf. {{bibleverse|Daniel|8:13|KJV}}; {{bibleverse-nb|Daniel|11:31|KJV}}; {{bibleverse-nb|Daniel|12:11|KJV}}).{{sfn|Lust|2002|pp=672\u201373}}\n\n=== Context within chapter 9 ===\n\n[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn - Jeremia treurend over de verwoesting van Jeruzalem - Google Art Project.jpg|200px|right|thumbnail|[[Rembrandt van Rijn]], \"Jeremiah Lamenting the Destruction of Jerusalem\", c. 1630.]]\n\nThe seventy weeks prophecy is internally dated to \"the first year of Darius son of Ahasuerus, by birth a Mede\" (verse 1), elsewhere referred to within the Book of Daniel as \"[[Darius the Mede]]\" (e.g. {{bibleverse|Daniel|11:1|KJV}}); however, no such ruler is known to history independently of the Book of Daniel and the widespread consensus among critical scholars is that he is a literary fiction.{{sfn|Rowley|1935|pp=12\u201366}} Nevertheless, within the fictionalized biblical account, the first year of Darius the Mede corresponds to the first year after the Babylonian kingdom is overthrown, i.e., 538 BCE.{{sfn|Segal|2011|p=289}}{{sfn|Waters|2016|p=97}}\n\nChapter 9 can be distinguished from the other \"visionary\" chapters of the Book of Daniel by the fact that the point of departure for this chapter is another biblical text in Jeremiah's seventy years prophecy and not a visionary episode.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=347}} The longstanding consensus among critical scholars has been that verses 24\u201327 is a paradigmatic example of inner-biblical interpretation, in which the latter text reinterprets Jeremiah's seventy years of exile as seventy weeks of years.{{sfn|Segal|2011|p=283}} On this view, Jeremiah's prophecy that after seventy years God would punish the Babylonian kingdom (cf. [[Jeremiah 25:12|Jer 25:12]]) and once again pay special attention to his people in responding to their prayers and restoring them to the land (cf. [[Jeremiah 29:10|Jer 29:10]]-14) could not have been fulfilled by the disappointment that accompanied the return to the land in the Persian period, hence the necessity to extend the expiration date of the prophecy to the second century BCE.{{sfn|Grabbe|1987|pp=67\u201372}}{{sfn|Segal|2011|p=283}} And just as various elements of Daniel's visionary episodes are interpreted for him in chapters 7\u20138, so also Jeremiah's prophecy is interpreted for him in a manner similar to the ''[[pesher]]'' exegesis evidenced at [[Qumran]] in chapter 9.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=359}}{{sfn|Segal|2011|p=284}} However, this consensus has recently been challenged on the grounds that Daniel prays to God following the defeat of the Babylonian kingdom precisely because Jeremiah's seventy years of exile have been completed and God promised through the prophet that he would respond to such prayers at this time,{{sfn|Waters|2016|p=97}} in which case the seventy weeks prophecy is not a reinterpretation of Jeremiah's prophecy but a separate prophecy altogether.{{sfn|Bergsma|2006|pp=212\u201325}}{{sfn|Segal|2011|pp=288\u201392, 302}} And these considerations have been further refined along redactional lines to suggest that the latter holds relative to an earlier \"pre-canonical\" stage in the text, but that the seventy weeks prophecy is, in fact, a reinterpretation of Jeremiah's prophecy relative to the final form of the text.{{sfn|Waters|2016|pp=97\u2013107}}\n\n=== The seventy weeks prophecy ===\n\nThe seventy \"weeks\" of years are divided into three periods of time: a seven-week period spanning forty-nine years, a sixty-two-week period spanning 434 years, and a final period of one week spanning seven years.{{sfn|Montgomery|1927|p=391}}{{sfn|Segal|2011|p=293}} The first period of seven weeks begins with the departure of a \"word\" to rebuild Jerusalem and ends with the arrival of an \"anointed prince\" (verse 25a). This \"word\" to rebuild Jerusalem has generally been taken to refer to Jeremiah's seventy years prophecy and dated to the fourth year of [[Jehoiakim]] (or the first year of [[Nebuchadnezzar]]) in 605/4 BCE.{{sfn|Koch|1980|p=150}}{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=354}} Collins objects to this identification on the basis that \"[t]he word to rebuild Jerusalem could scarcely have gone forth before it was destroyed\" and prefers to see this as a reference to the \"word\" that Gabriel came to give Daniel in verse 23;{{sfn|Collins|1993|pp=354\u201355}} other possible candidates suggested by critical scholars include the edict of Cyrus in 539/8 BCE,{{sfn|Hess|2011|p=317}}{{sfn|Waters|2016|pp=100\u2013101}} the decree of [[Artaxerxes I of Persia|Artaxerxes I]] in 458/7 BCE,{{sfn|Redditt|2000|p=238}}{{sfn|Waters|2016|pp=100\u2013101}} and the warrant given to [[Nehemiah]] in 445/4 BCE.{{sfn|Goldingay|1989|p=260}}{{sfn|Redditt|2000|p=238}} The \"prince\" in verse 25a may refer to either an actual prince or some other figure of authority and critical scholars have proposed various candidates here as well, including Cyrus (cf.

Hence, some critical scholars follow Montgomery in thinking that there has been \"a chronological miscalculation on [the] part of the writer,\"{{sfn|Montgomery|1927|p=393}} who is then criticized for making \"wrong-headed arithmetical calculations;\"{{sfn|Porteous|1965|p=134}} while others like [[John Goldingay|Goldingay]] are not inclined to see this as a \"chronological miscalculation\" on the basis that the seventy weeks are not an exercise in literal chronology, but the more inexact science of \"chronography.\"{{sfn|Goldingay|1989|pp=257\u201358}}{{sfn|Segal|2011|p=298}} Collins opts for something like a middle-ground position in saying that \"the figure should be considered a round number rather than a miscalculation.\"{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=356}} And there are still others who see the calculations as being at least approximately correct so long as the initial seven-week period of forty-nine years can overlap with the sixty-two-week period of 434 years, with the latter period spanning the time between Jeremiah's prophecy in 605/4 BCE and Onias III's murder in 171/0 BCE.{{sfn|Athas|2009|pp=16\u201317}}{{sfn|Waters|2016|p=106}}\n\n[[File:AntiochusIVEpiphanes.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Coin of Antiochus IV.

One of the more popular older views was that this difficult phrase was a contemptuous deformation (or [[dysphemism]]) of the [[Phoenician religion|Phoenician deity]] [[Baalshamin|Baal Shamin]]\u2014the \"Lord of Heaven\"\u2014whom [[Philo of Byblos]] identified with the Greek [[sky god]] [[Zeus]].{{sfn|Lust|2002|pp=674}} Moreover, the temple in Jerusalem was rededicated in honor of Zeus according to [[2 Maccabees]] 6:2, hence the tendency among older commentators to follow [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] in seeing this \"abomination\" in terms of a statue of Zeus.{{sfn|Lust|2002|pp=677\u201378}} More recently, it has been suggested that the reference is to certain sacred stones (possibly [[meteorite]]s) that were affixed to the great [[Altar (Bible)|altar]] of sacrifice for the purposes of pagan worship in the temple,{{sfn|Porteous|1965|p=143}}{{sfn|Goldstein|1976|pp=144\u201351}} since the use of such stones is well-attested in [[Ancient Canaanite religion|Canaanite]] and Syrian cults.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=358}} However, both sorts of proposals have been criticized on the basis that they are either too speculative, dependent on flawed analysis, or not well-suited to the relevant context in the Book of Daniel.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=358}}{{sfn|Lust|2002|pp=675\u201382}} Increasingly, critical scholars tend to see the expression as being a reference to either the pagan offerings that were given during the Antiochene crisis instead of the twice-daily continual offering that had been forbidden (cf. Dan 11:31; 12:11; 2 Macc 6:5),{{sfn|Lust|2002|pp=682\u201387}}{{sfn|Waters|2016|p=107}} or the pagan altar on which such offerings were made.{{sfn|Goldingay|1989|p=263}}{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=358}}\n\n==Computations==\nRoger T.

The \"abomination that desolates\" is typically read in the context of the [[New Testament]] references made to this expression in the [[Olivet Discourse]] and understood as belonging to a complex eschatological tableaux described therein, which may or may not remain to be fulfilled.\n\nAnother influential way of reading the prophecy follows [[Sextus Julius Africanus|Africanus]] in identifying the warrant given to Nehemiah in 445/4 BCE as the ''terminus a quo''.{{sfn|Hess|2011|p=322}} 483 years from 445/4 BCE would extend somewhat beyond the lifetime of Christ to 39/40 CE, hence some Christological interpretations reduce the period to 476 years by viewing them as [[360-day calendar|360-day]] \"[[prophetic years]]\" (or \"Chaldee years\" {{sfn|Lloyd|1690|p=i}}), so-called on the basis that various biblical passages\u2014such as Revelation 12:6, 14 (cf. Dan 7:25; 12:7)\u2014appear to reckon time in this way in certain prophetic contexts.{{sfn|Hoehner|1978|pp=136\u201337}} The sixty-nine weeks of \"prophetic\" years are then considered to terminate with the death of Christ in 32/3 CE.{{sfn|Doukhan|1979|p=2}}{{sfn|Hoehner|1978|p=141}} The seventieth week is then separated from the sixty-ninth week by a long period of time known as the [[Dispensationalism#Start of the Church Age|church age]];{{sfn|Doukhan|1979|p=2}}{{sfn|Hess|2011|p=322}} hence, the seventieth week does not begin until the end of the church age, at which point the church will be removed from the earth in an event called the [[rapture]].

He was involved in politics in the 1940s, and again after the 1958 restoration of democracy, but retired from politics in 1964 until the early 1990s, pursuing a career in business. He was then an early supporter of [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]]' post-1992 political career, and was the Venezuelan Minister of Interior and Justice from 2001 to 2002, when he resigned.<ref>''AP'', 25 January 2002, [http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&p_multi=APAB&d_place=APAB&p_theme=newslibrary2&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F86C4422D1DB623&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM Venezuela's Chavez replaces interior minister in cabinet shuffle; criticizes remarks by Vatican diplomat]</ref>\n\n==First political career==\nMiquilena began his political career with the [[Venezuelan Communist Party]] (PCV) in the 1940s as [[Secretary General]] of the Union of Bus Drivers (Spanish: ''Sindicato de Autobuseros''), allied with [[President (government title)|President]] [[Isa\u00edas Medina Angarita]]. He remained with the PCV for the next four years. Later, he became a firm opponent of president [[R\u00f3mulo Betancourt]] (first presidency 1945-1948). In 1945, he broke with the PCV over their support of Betancourt and formed his own political party, the Revolutionary Party of the Proletariat (PRP). The PRP was short-lived, lasting from the overthrow of the [[R\u00f3mulo Gallegos|Gallegos]] government (in office February 1948-November 1948) until the rise of [[Marcos P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez]].\n\nMiquilena opposed P\u00e9rez's government as well and as a result was jailed for much of the dictatorship and was initially tortured at a jail in Caracas. He was later transferred to a jail in Ciudad Bolivar, Miquilena became friends with [[Democratic Action (Venezuela)|Democratic Action]] politician [[Sim\u00f3n Alberto Consalvi]], stating that \"Simon was a man that I think men should be\". While imprisoned, family members would communicate cryptically by marking points on letters of books delivered to prisoners, informing Miquilena of the condition of Venezuela outside of prison. His time in prison helped him decide his views on politics. Jim\u00e9nez was overthrown in 1958, and in an attempt to stabilize the fledgling democracy that succeeded the dictatorship, three Venezuelan political parties entered into the [[Pacto de Punto Fijo]].<ref name=\"RUNRUNES\">{{cite news|last1=Arroyo Gil|first1=Diego|title=Entrevista in\u00e9dita con Miquilena: Ch\u00e1vez es el gran responsable del drama que padece Venezuela|url=http://runrun.es/rr-es-plus/288267/entrevista-inedita-con-miquilena-chavez-es-el-gran-responsable-del-drama-que-padece-venezuela.html|accessdate=26 November 2016|work=[[Runrunes]]|date=24 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1959, Miquilena became the owner and director of the newspaper ''El Clar\u00edn''. Over time, he progressively became a strong opponent of the government of [[R\u00f3mulo Betancourt]] (second presidency 1959-1964) over its opposition to the [[Cuba]]n government under [[Fidel Castro]] and its alleged repression of leftwing political groups.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} However, Miquilena never agreed with guerrillas, calling them a \"respectable mistake\", saying \"A 20 year old who decides to risk his life deserves respect. That's what made me a defender of the people who were fighting the battle against the armed forces, even though in privacy I was a fierce enemy of the guerrilla. It was a mistake that cost us a lot. If we channeled the democratic struggle from the beginning, with all the strength we had, through a rational and institutional way, who knows if the story would be different.\"<ref name=\"RUNRUNES\"/> In 1961, Miquilena joined the [[Democratic Republican Union]] (URD) party and he became a Representative for the state of [[Falc\u00f3n]] in the [[Venezuelan Chamber of Deputies]]. In 1964, he left the staff of ''El Clar\u00edn'', quit the URD, and retired from political life. For the next 30 years, he dedicated himself to business, becoming a landowner and industrialist.\n\nHe approved of the Pacto de Punto Fijo believing that Venezuela had a \"history of coups and militarism\" and that this was a good attempt to solve that problem, though the failure of this system led to Ch\u00e1vez coming to party, which he thought was worse.<ref name=\"RUNRUNES\"/>\n\n==Second political career==\n{{Quote box|width=250px|align=right|quote=All those things for which we had fought, the separation of powers, the quality of the judiciary, and so on.

Ch\u00e1vez also convinced Miquilena that he was not going to follow a Cuban model, but later took back his word. When Miquilena realized that Ch\u00e1vez was taking a similar path as the Cuban government and Ch\u00e1vez was centralizing power around himself, he decided to retire. He met with Castro and Ch\u00e1vez on [[Margarita Island]], looking to Castro for assistance with Ch\u00e1vez, however \"Fidel had discovered the immense vanity of Chavez, and took advantage of it to get the slice of the century. Thereafter he devoted himself, in a roguish way, to take advantage of Ch\u00e1vez, regardless of what happened in Venezuela\".<ref name=\"RUNRUNES\"/>\n\nIn an interview a month after the failed [[2002 Venezuelan coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|coup against Ch\u00e1vez in April 2002]], Miquilena rejected the view that the people had restored Ch\u00e1vez to power. Miquilena declared that it was the incompetence of one of the coup leaders, [[Pedro Carmona]], who had served as president for 36 hours, which restored Ch\u00e1vez to power \"by his decree to dissolve the Assembly and by ousting all mayors\".<ref>''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]'' (Madrid), 12 May 2002</ref> In 2007, Miquilena voiced his disagreement with the [[2007 Venezuelan constitutional referendum|proposal for constitutional reform]].\n\n==Later life and death==\nIn 2013 after Venezuela suffered the effects of Ch\u00e1vez's presidency, Miquilena was interviewed by the Venezuelan news website [[Runrunes]]. He stated that he did not feel guilty about helping Ch\u00e1vez gain power but stated that he felt \"very sorry\" for not being able to fight against the effects of Ch\u00e1vez during the end of his life. When asked how he would fight back against the Bolivarian government, he said that he would be \"in the front line, uniting and gathering people to face the disaster we are suffering\" and that \"the popular struggle is not armed. It is the struggle of the people on the street. In every line of people to buy flour bread and toilet paper should be someone shaking up the people\".<ref name=\"RUNRUNES\"/>\n\nThree years later, Miquilena died in Caracas on November 24, 2016 and the interview, one of his last, was released to the public.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.eluniversal.com/noticias/politica/fallecio-caracas-politico-venezolano-luis-miquilena_628554 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-11-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126111115/http://www.eluniversal.com/noticias/politica/fallecio-caracas-politico-venezolano-luis-miquilena_628554 |archive-date=2016-11-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"RUNRUNES\"/>\n\n==Popular culture==\n[[Miguel Otero Silva]] made him the central character of ''La Muerte de Honorio'', a novel about the anti-Jim\u00e9nez resistance movement.<ref>Jones, Bart (2008), ''Hugo!

He was involved in politics in the 1940s, and again after the 1958 restoration of democracy, but retired from politics in 1964 until the early 1990s, pursuing a career in business. He was then an early supporter of [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]]' post-1992 political career, and was the Venezuelan Minister of Interior and Justice from 2001 to 2002, when he resigned.<ref>''AP'', 25 January 2002, [http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&p_multi=APAB&d_place=APAB&p_theme=newslibrary2&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F86C4422D1DB623&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM Venezuela's Chavez replaces interior minister in cabinet shuffle; criticizes remarks by Vatican diplomat]</ref>\n\n==First political career==\nMiquilena began his political career with the [[Venezuelan Communist Party]] (PCV) in the 1940s as [[Secretary General]] of the Union of Bus Drivers (Spanish: ''Sindicato de Autobuseros''), allied with [[President (government title)|President]] [[Isa\u00edas Medina Angarita]]. He remained with the PCV for the next four years. Later, he became a firm opponent of president [[R\u00f3mulo Betancourt]] (first presidency 1945-1948). In 1945, he broke with the PCV over their support of Betancourt and formed his own political party, the Revolutionary Party of the Proletariat (PRP). The PRP was short-lived, lasting from the overthrow of the [[R\u00f3mulo Gallegos|Gallegos]] government (in office February 1948-November 1948) until the rise of [[Marcos P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez]].\n\nMiquilena opposed P\u00e9rez's government as well and as a result was jailed for much of the dictatorship and was initially tortured at a jail in Caracas. He was later transferred to a jail in Ciudad Bolivar, Miquilena became friends with [[Democratic Action (Venezuela)|Democratic Action]] politician [[Sim\u00f3n Alberto Consalvi]], stating that \"Simon was a man that I think men should be\". While imprisoned, family members would communicate cryptically by marking points on letters of books delivered to prisoners, informing Miquilena of the condition of Venezuela outside of prison. His time in prison helped him decide his views on politics. Jim\u00e9nez was overthrown in 1958, and in an attempt to stabilize the fledgling democracy that succeeded the dictatorship, three Venezuelan political parties entered into the [[Pacto de Punto Fijo]].<ref name=\"RUNRUNES\">{{cite news|last1=Arroyo Gil|first1=Diego|title=Entrevista in\u00e9dita con Miquilena: Ch\u00e1vez es el gran responsable del drama que padece Venezuela|url=http://runrun.es/rr-es-plus/288267/entrevista-inedita-con-miquilena-chavez-es-el-gran-responsable-del-drama-que-padece-venezuela.html|accessdate=26 November 2016|work=[[Runrunes]]|date=24 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1959, Miquilena became the owner and director of the newspaper ''El Clar\u00edn''. Over time, he progressively became a strong opponent of the government of [[R\u00f3mulo Betancourt]] (second presidency 1959-1964) over its opposition to the [[Cuba]]n government under [[Fidel Castro]] and its alleged repression of leftwing political groups.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} However, Miquilena never agreed with guerrillas, calling them a \"respectable mistake\", saying \"A 20 year old who decides to risk his life deserves respect. That's what made me a defender of the people who were fighting the battle against the armed forces, even though in privacy I was a fierce enemy of the guerrilla. It was a mistake that cost us a lot. If we channeled the democratic struggle from the beginning, with all the strength we had, through a rational and institutional way, who knows if the story would be different.\"<ref name=\"RUNRUNES\"/> In 1961, Miquilena joined the [[Democratic Republican Union]] (URD) party and he became a Representative for the state of [[Falc\u00f3n]] in the [[Venezuelan Chamber of Deputies]]. In 1964, he left the staff of ''El Clar\u00edn'', quit the URD, and retired from political life. For the next 30 years, he dedicated himself to business, becoming a landowner and industrialist.\n\nHe approved of the Pacto de Punto Fijo believing that Venezuela had a \"history of coups and militarism\" and that this was a good attempt to solve that problem, though the failure of this system led to Ch\u00e1vez coming to party, which he thought was worse.<ref name=\"RUNRUNES\"/>\n\n==Second political career==\n{{Quote box|width=250px|align=right|quote=All those things for which we had fought, the separation of powers, the quality of the judiciary, and so on. And corruption. All this gives way to Ch\u00e1vez. Ch\u00e1vez rides in on a crisis that was in Venezuela. And it was, at first, through a democratic discourse. Not with that gibberish that he devoted himself afterward, that [[21st century socialism]].|source=Luis Miquilena, 2013<ref name=\"RUNRUNES\"/>}}\nIn the 1990s, he met [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]] and returned to the political arena as one of the founders of the [[Fifth Republic Movement]] (MVR). He initially heard about Ch\u00e1vez owing to Ch\u00e1vez's [[1992 Venezuelan coup d'\u00e9tat attempts|February 1992 coup attempt]], and visited him in jail.<ref>Jones (2008:167)</ref>\n\nDuring the first years of the Ch\u00e1vez administration, Miquilena held important government posts: president of the [[1999 Constituent Assembly of Venezuela|Constituent Assembly]] (which drafted the 1999 [[Constitution of Venezuela]]), president of the National Legislative Commission, Senator (term began 1999), and [[Minister of Interior and Justice (Venezuela)|Minister of Justice and the Interior]] (February 2001<ref>''BBC'', 4 February 2001, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1153394.stm Venezuelan cabinet reshuffle]</ref> - January 2002<ref>''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'', 25 January 2002, [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/orlandosentinel/access/102194816.html?dids=102194816:102194816&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jan+25,+2002&author=&pub=Orlando+Sentinel&desc=CHAVEZ+KICKS+OUT+MENTOR&pqatl=google Chavez kicks out mentor]</ref>). In the latter post, he launched the Citizen Security Plan and promoted the Peaceful Prison Disarmament Plan.<ref>''[[El Universal (Caracas)|El Universal]]'' (Caracas), 1 Feb 2008</ref>\n\n===Retirement===\nDisagreements with measures taken by president Ch\u00e1vez led to a <ref>https://theconversation.com/venezuela-what-chavezs-mentor-told-me-about-the-countrys-castro-inspired-road-to-ruin-80249 political break.</ref> In the months before the [[2002 Venezuelan coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|coup against Ch\u00e1vez in April 2002]], Miquilena talked with Fidel Castro and the two agreed that they did not want Venezuela to take the same path as Cuba. Ch\u00e1vez also convinced Miquilena that he was not going to follow a Cuban model, but later took back his word. When Miquilena realized that Ch\u00e1vez was taking a similar path as the Cuban government and Ch\u00e1vez was centralizing power around himself, he decided to retire. He met with Castro and Ch\u00e1vez on [[Margarita Island]], looking to Castro for assistance with Ch\u00e1vez, however \"Fidel had discovered the immense vanity of Chavez, and took advantage of it to get the slice of the century. Thereafter he devoted himself, in a roguish way, to take advantage of Ch\u00e1vez, regardless of what happened in Venezuela\".<ref name=\"RUNRUNES\"/>\n\nIn an interview a month after the failed [[2002 Venezuelan coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|coup against Ch\u00e1vez in April 2002]], Miquilena rejected the view that the people had restored Ch\u00e1vez to power. Miquilena declared that it was the incompetence of one of the coup leaders, [[Pedro Carmona]], who had served as president for 36 hours, which restored Ch\u00e1vez to power \"by his decree to dissolve the Assembly and by ousting all mayors\".<ref>''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]'' (Madrid), 12 May 2002</ref> In 2007, Miquilena voiced his disagreement with the [[2007 Venezuelan constitutional referendum|proposal for constitutional reform]].\n\n==Later life and death==\nIn 2013 after Venezuela suffered the effects of Ch\u00e1vez's presidency, Miquilena was interviewed by the Venezuelan news website [[Runrunes]]. He stated that he did not feel guilty about helping Ch\u00e1vez gain power but stated that he felt \"very sorry\" for not being able to fight against the affects of Ch\u00e1vez during the end of his life. When asked how he would fight back against the Bolivarian government, he said that he would be \"in the front line, uniting and gathering people to face the disaster we are suffering\" and that \"the popular struggle is not armed. It is the struggle of the people on the street. In every line of people to buy flour bread and toilet paper should be someone shaking up the people\".<ref name=\"RUNRUNES\"/>\n\nThree years later, Miquilena died in Caracas on November 24, 2016 and the interview, one of his last, was released to the public.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.eluniversal.com/noticias/politica/fallecio-caracas-politico-venezolano-luis-miquilena_628554 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-11-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126111115/http://www.eluniversal.com/noticias/politica/fallecio-caracas-politico-venezolano-luis-miquilena_628554 |archive-date=2016-11-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"RUNRUNES\"/>\n\n==Popular culture==\n[[Miguel Otero Silva]] made him the central character of ''La Muerte de Honorio'', a novel about the anti-Jim\u00e9nez resistance movement.<ref>Jones, Bart (2008), ''Hugo!
