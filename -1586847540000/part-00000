{"title_page": "Sex differences in human physiology", "text_new": "[[File:Human Body.jpg|thumb|right|Example of male and female anatomy from front and back.]]\n'''Sex differences in human physiology''' are distinctions of physiological characteristics associated with either male or female humans. These can be of several types, including direct and indirect. Direct being the direct result of differences prescribed by the Y-chromosome, and indirect being a characteristic influenced indirectly (e.g. hormonally) by the Y-chromosome. '''[[Sexual dimorphism]]''' is a term for the [[phenotype|phenotypic]] difference between males and females of the same species.\n\nDirect sex differences follow a [[bimodal distribution]]. Through the process of [[meiosis]] and [[fertilization]] (with rare exceptions), each individual is created with zero or one Y-chromosome. The complementary result for the X-chromosome follows, either a double or a single X. Therefore, direct sex differences are usually binary in expression (although the deviations in complex biological processes produce a menagerie of exceptions). These include, most conspicuously, male (vs female) [[gonads]].\n\nIndirect sex differences are general differences as quantified by [[empirical data]] and [[statistics|statistical]] analysis. Most differing characteristics will conform to a [[bell distribution|bell-curve]] (i.e. normal) distribution which can be broadly described by the mean (peak distribution) and standard deviation (indicator of size of range). Often only the mean or mean difference between sexes is given. This may or may not preclude overlap in distributions. For example, most [[males]] are taller than most [[females]],<ref name=\"Gustafsson\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gustafsson A, Lindenfors P|lastauthoramp=yes | year=2004 | title=Human size evolution: no allometric relationship between male and female stature | journal=Journal of Human Evolution | volume=47 | pages=253\u2013266 | doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2004.07.004 | pmid=15454336 | issue=4}}</ref> but an individual female could be taller than an individual male.\n\nThe most obvious differences between males and females include all the features related to reproductive role, notably the endocrine (hormonal) systems and their physiological and behavioural effects, including gonadal differentiation, internal and external genital and [[breast]] differentiation, and differentiation of muscle mass, height, and hair distribution.\n==Sex determination and differentiation==\n[[File:YChromShowingSRY2.png|thumb|200px|The Human [[Y Chromosome]] showing the SRY gene. SRY is a gene which regulates sexual differentiation.]]\n: {{See also|Sexual differentiation in humans}}\nThe [[human genome]] consists of two copies of each of 23 [[chromosomes]] (a total of 46). One set of 23 comes from the mother and one set comes from the father. Of these 23 pairs of chromosomes, 22 are [[autosomes]], and one is a [[sex chromosome]]. There are two kinds of sex chromosomes\u2013[[X chromosome|\"X\"]] and [[Y chromosome|\"Y\"]]. In humans and in almost all other mammals, females carry two X chromosomes, designated XX, and males carry one X and one Y, designated XY.\n\nA human egg contains only one set of chromosomes (23) and is said to be [[haploid]]. Sperm also have only one set of 23 chromosomes and are therefore haploid. When an egg and sperm fuse at [[fertilization]], the two sets of chromosomes come together to form a unique \"[[diploid]]\" individual with 46 chromosomes.\n\nThe sex chromosome in a human egg is always an X chromosome, since a female only has X sex chromosomes. In sperm, about half the sperm have an X chromosome and half have a Y chromosome. If an egg fuses with a sperm with a Y chromosome, the resulting individual is male. If an egg fuses with a sperm with an X chromosome, the resulting individual is female. There are rare exceptions to this rule in which, for example, XX individuals develop as males or XY individuals develop as females.  Chromosomes are not the final determinant of sex.  In some cases, for example, chromosomally female babies that have been exposed to high levels of androgens before birth can develop masculinized genitals by the time they are born.<ref>Birke, Lydia.

In humans, [[X-chromosome inactivation]] enables males and females to have equal expression of the genes on the X-chromosome since females have two X-chromosomes while males have a single X and a Y chromosome. X-chromosome inactivation is random in the somatic cells of the body as either the maternal or paternal X-chromosome can become inactivated in each cell. Thus, females are genetic mosaics.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Carrel L, Willard HF |title=X-inactivation profile reveals extensive variability in X-linked gene expression in females |journal=Nature |volume=434 |issue=7031 |pages=400\u20134 |date=March 2005 |pmid=15772666 |doi=10.1038/nature03479 }}</ref>\n\nThis process is seen in all mammals and is also referred to as ''lyonisation'' \u2014after the geneticist [[Mary F. Lyon]] who described the process in 1962. In the somatic cells of a developing female child, one of the X-chromosomes is shortened and condensed. The genes on this chromosome therefore can not be transcribed into an mRNA transcript and remain unread. These condensed structures can be seen as dark bodies under the microscope and are commonly referred to as [[Barr bodies]]. In individuals with [[Klinefelter's syndrome]] (females: XXX, males: XXY) the extra X-chromosome is inactivated, resulting in two Barr bodies.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bird A |title=Perceptions of epigenetics |journal=Nature |volume=447 |issue=7143 |pages=396\u20138 |date=May 2007 |pmid=17522671 |doi=10.1038/nature05913 }}</ref>\n\n===Sexual dimorphism===\n:''For information about how males and females develop differences throughout the lifespan, see [[sexual differentiation]].''\nSexual dimorphism (two forms) refers to the general phenomenon in which male and female forms of an organism display distinct morphological characteristics or features.\n\nSexual dimorphism in humans is the subject of much controversy, especially relating to mental ability and psychological gender. (For a discussion, see [[sexual dimorphism|biology of gender]], [[sex and intelligence]], [[gender]], and [[transgender]].) Obvious differences between men and women include all the features related to reproductive role, notably the endocrine (hormonal) systems and their physical, psychological and behavioral effects. Although sex is a binary dichotomy, with \"male\" and \"female\" representing opposite and complementary sex categories for the purpose of reproduction, a small number of individuals have an anatomy that does not conform to either male or female standards, or contains features closely associated with both. Such individuals, described as [[intersexuals]], are sometimes infertile but are often capable of reproducing.  The current estimated rate for intersexuality is about 1 in 1500 to 1 in 2000 births.  There are a greater number of individuals, however, who have a subtler variation of their assigned sex.  These variations are not always present at birth.<ref>[http://www.isna.org/faq/frequency How common is intersex? | Intersex Society of North America<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Intersexuality is not often discussed or witnessed in Western culture because when an intersexual baby is born, surgery is usually performed within the first 24 hours to assign a sex to the baby.<ref name=Fausto-Sterling>{{cite book|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|title=Sexing the body: gender politics and the construction of sexuality|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780465077137|url-access=registration|year=2000|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, NY|pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780465077137/page/45 45]}}</ref>\n\n==Evolution of sexual dimorphism in human voice pitch==\nThe pitch of a male voice is about half as high in males in comparison to females.<ref>Titze, I.

One difference is the proportions of [[white matter]] relative to [[grey matter]].]]\n\nStructural brain differences usually correspond to sexually dimorphic attributes that bring about functional brain differences.\n\nOn average, female brains have a larger ratio of grey matter to white matter than males (particularly in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and superior temporal gyrus), even when sex-differences in total intracranial volume are taken into consideration. Most notably, males have a larger amount of white matter in the frontal and temporal [[perisylvian region]], and in the temporal stem and optic radiation, of the left hemisphere, whereas females have a larger amount of gray matter in the [[superior temporal gyrus]], [[planum temporale]], [[Heschl gyrus]], [[cingulate gyrus]], [[Inferior frontal gyrus|inferior frontal]], and [[Central sulcus|central sulci]] margins, of the left hemisphere.\n\nThe degree of [[brain asymmetry|hemispheric asymmetry]] in males corresponds to the relative size of [[corpus callosum]]; however, this is not true in females. An increase in hemispheric asymmetry in male brains causes a male sex-dependent decrease in inter-hemispheric connectivity. Numerous studies suggest that, on average, female brains have more [[commissural tract]]s involved in inter-hemispheric connectivity than males. More specifically, it suggests that: the [[anterior commissure]] is larger in females than males; [[massa intermedia]] is more abundant in females than males; females have a larger ratio of cross-sectional area of the corpus callosum to cerebral volume and to forebrain size than males. Although, fewer studies have alternatively found otherwise.\n\nTypically, male brains are more asymmetric than female brains. Females have less asymmetry than males between left and right hemispheric cortical thickness. Males have a larger intra-hemispheric long-range interconnectivity than females, whereas females have a larger inter-hemispheric connectivity. Males have larger left hemispheric asymmetries than females in various brain areas, including the superior temporal gyrus, Heschl gyrus, deeper central sulcus, overall temporal and parietal and [[inferior parietal lobule]], [[thalamus]] and [[posterior cingulate]].  Although, fewer studies have alternatively found otherwise.\n\nThere are also differences in the structure of and in specific areas of the brain. On average, the [[Sexually dimorphic nucleus|SDN]] has been repeatedly found to be considerably larger in males than in females. The volume of the SDN was 2.2 times as large in males as in females. On average, the [[Stria terminalis#Bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST)|BSTc]] is twice as large in men as in women. On average, the [[INAH 3|INAH-3]] is significantly larger in males than in females regardless of age. Two studies found that men have larger [[parietal lobe]]s, an area responsible for sensory input including spatial sense and navigation; though, another study failed to find any statistically significant difference.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Frederikse ME |author2=Lu A |author3=Aylward E |author4=Barta P |author5=Pearlson G |title=Sex differences in the inferior parietal lobule |journal=Cereb.

The male amygdala is proportionally larger than that in women, causing sex to be a determining factor in reactions to stress. In studies of rats, there are more numerous interconnections seen in males in regard to this structure, suggesting the same pattern in humans. Katharina Braun and company (Otto von Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany) studied a litter of [[Common degu|Degu]] puppies removed from their mother and determined that hearing their mother's call produced a higher concentration of serotonin in males' amygdala and a decreased concentration in females' amygdala. In this case, stress causes females' emotion regulation to drop, while males seem to keep more of an even keel. While this study was limited to rodents, it provides a possible explanation of why anxiety disorders occur more often among human females than males.<ref name=\"scientificamerican.com\">{{cite journal | last1 = Cahill | first1 = Larry | title = His Brain, Her Brain | url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=his-brain-her-brain | journal = Scientific American | year = 2005 | issue =  3| pages = 40\u201347 | doi = 10.1038/scientificamericanmind0509-40 | volume = 20 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120317023332/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=his-brain-her-brain | archivedate = 2012-03-17 }} {{cite journal | last1 = Alexander | first1 = Gerianne M. | last2 = Hines | first2 = Melissa | year = 2002 | title = Sex differences in response to children's toys in nonhuman primates (Cercopithecus aethiops sabaeus)| url = | journal = Evolution and Human Behavior | volume = 23 | issue = 6| pages = 467\u2013479 | doi=10.1016/s1090-5138(02)00107-1}}</ref> Also, the hypothalamus and frontomedial area, both of which are associated with emotional processing, are larger in males than females.

The hippocampus is crucial for memory storage and spatial mapping of the physical environment. This structural difference may be responsible for variations in behavior between the sexes. Studies show that women are more likely to navigate using landmarks, while men are more likely to estimate distance in space or orientation. Studies of rats show that males could learn better in the face of acute stress, while chronic stress is dealt with better by females. Sex hormones may influence female hippocampal cells to tolerate brain damage better than the same cells in men. The studies of the rats' influx and deflation of hippocampal cells can be translated to the difference in memory and spatial behaviors between the sexes.<ref name=\"scientificamerican.com\"/>\n\nOn average, [[Onuf\u2019s nucleus]] is sexually dimorphic, meaning that there are differences in Onuf\u2019s nucleus between males and females of the same species.

Research done on vervet monkeys showed that male and female monkeys gravitated towards sex-typical preferred toys. This study controls for external societal influence by using monkeys as the subject, and projects results to humans, the closest animal relative. A separate study was done on one-day-old infants to see if infants diverted attention differently between the sexes. Results showed that there must be some innate mechanism that differs between the sexes. This innate mechanism is evolutionary in the sense that the hormones for females are concurrently passed down to other females, and the same with males.<ref name=\"scientificamerican.com\"/>\n\nOther than external genitals, there are few physical differences before puberty.  Small differences in height and start of physical maturity are seen.  In the first decade of human life there is a significant amount of overlap between children of both sexes.  The gradual growth in sex difference throughout a person's life is a product of various hormones.  [[Testosterone]] is the major active hormone in male development while [[estrogen]] is the dominant female hormone.  These hormones are not, however, limited to each sex.  Both males and females have both testosterone and estrogen.<ref>Birke, Lydia. The Gender and Science Reader  ed. Muriel Lederman and Ingrid Bartsch.

There is no significant gender difference in rates of [[schizophrenia]] and [[bipolar depression]]. Women are more likely to suffer from [[unipolar depression]], [[anxiety]], [[eating disorders]], and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]. Men are more likely to suffer from [[alcoholism]] and [[antisocial personality disorder]], as well as developmental psychiatric disorders such as [[autism spectrum disorder]]s and [[Tourette syndrome]].\n*Women are more likely to suffer from depression, due in part to low social status being such a powerful predictor for depression.\n*While men are more likely to suffer from alcoholism, women are more prone to addiction. This is because estrogen boosts the release of dopamine in brain regions important for regulating drug-seeking behavior, making women more vulnerable to dependence.\n*Schizophrenia does not show prevalence differences of significance among sexes, but there is a difference in the brain structures related. Women naturally have a higher orbitofrontal-to-amygdala ratio (OAR) than men, but not schizophrenic women (lower OAR). Men with schizophrenia however, have a higher orbitofrontal-to-amygdala ratio than that of healthy men.\n<ref name=\"scientificamerican.com\"/>\n\n* Before [[menopause]], women are less likely to suffer from [[cardiovascular disease]]. However, after age 60, the risk for both men and women is the same.\n* Overall, men are more likely to suffer from [[cancer]], with much of this driven by [[lung cancer]]. In most countries, more men than women [[Tobacco smoking|smoke]], although this gap is narrowing especially among young women.\n* Women are twice as likely to be [[Blindness|blind]] as men. In developed countries, this may be linked to higher life expectancy and age-related conditions. In developing countries, women are less likely to get timely treatments for conditions that lead to blindness such as cataracts and [[trachoma]].\n* Women are more likely to suffer from [[osteoarthritis]] and [[osteoporosis]].  The density of bones depends upon the stresses that are put on them through exercise.  Exercise and activity in childhood helps to build up higher density bones.

These can be of several types, including direct and indirect. Direct being the direct result of differences prescribed by the Y-chromosome, and indirect being a characteristic influenced indirectly (e.g. hormonally) by the Y-chromosome. '''[[Sexual dimorphism]]''' is a term for the [[phenotype|phenotypic]] difference between males and females of the same species.\n\nDirect sex differences follow a [[bimodal distribution]]. Through the process of [[meiosis]] and [[fertilization]] (with rare exceptions), each individual is created with zero or one Y-chromosome. The complementary result for the X-chromosome follows, either a double or a single X. Therefore, direct sex differences are usually binary in expression (although the deviations in complex biological processes produce a menagerie of exceptions). These include, most conspicuously, male (vs female) [[gonads]].\n\nIndirect sex differences are general differences as quantified by [[empirical data]] and [[statistics|statistical]] analysis. Most differing characteristics will conform to a [[bell distribution|bell-curve]] (i.e. normal) distribution which can be broadly described by the mean (peak distribution) and standard deviation (indicator of size of range). Often only the mean or mean difference between sexes is given. This may or may not preclude overlap in distributions.

SRY is a gene which regulates sexual differentiation.]]\n: {{See also|Sexual differentiation in humans}}\nThe [[human genome]] consists of two copies of each of 23 [[chromosomes]] (a total of 46). One set of 23 comes from the mother and one set comes from the father. Of these 23 pairs of chromosomes, 22 are [[autosomes]], and one is a [[sex chromosome]]. There are two kinds of sex chromosomes\u2013[[X chromosome|\"X\"]] and [[Y chromosome|\"Y\"]]. In humans and in almost all other mammals, females carry two X chromosomes, designated XX, and males carry one X and one Y, designated XY.\n\nA human egg contains only one set of chromosomes (23) and is said to be [[haploid]]. Sperm also have only one set of 23 chromosomes and are therefore haploid. When an egg and sperm fuse at [[fertilization]], the two sets of chromosomes come together to form a unique \"[[diploid]]\" individual with 46 chromosomes.\n\nThe sex chromosome in a human egg is always an X chromosome, since a female only has X sex chromosomes. In sperm, about half the sperm have an X chromosome and half have a Y chromosome. If an egg fuses with a sperm with a Y chromosome, the resulting individual is male. If an egg fuses with a sperm with an X chromosome, the resulting individual is female. There are rare exceptions to this rule in which, for example, XX individuals develop as males or XY individuals develop as females.  Chromosomes are not the final determinant of sex.  In some cases, for example, chromosomally female babies that have been exposed to high levels of androgens before birth can develop masculinized genitals by the time they are born.<ref>Birke, Lydia.

In humans, [[X-chromosome inactivation]] enables males and females to have equal expression of the genes on the X-chromosome since females have two X-chromosomes while males have a single X and a Y chromosome. X-chromosome inactivation is random in the somatic cells of the body as either the maternal or paternal X-chromosome can become inactivated in each cell. Thus, females are genetic mosaics.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Carrel L, Willard HF |title=X-inactivation profile reveals extensive variability in X-linked gene expression in females |journal=Nature |volume=434 |issue=7031 |pages=400\u20134 |date=March 2005 |pmid=15772666 |doi=10.1038/nature03479 }}</ref>\n\nThis process is seen in all mammals and is also referred to as ''lyonisation'' \u2014after the geneticist [[Mary F. Lyon]] who described the process in 1962. In the somatic cells of a developing female child, one of the X-chromosomes is shortened and condensed. The genes on this chromosome therefore can not be transcribed into an mRNA transcript and remain unread. These condensed structures can be seen as dark bodies under the microscope and are commonly referred to as [[Barr bodies]]. In individuals with [[Klinefelter's syndrome]] (females: XXX, males: XXY) the extra X-chromosome is inactivated, resulting in two Barr bodies.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bird A |title=Perceptions of epigenetics |journal=Nature |volume=447 |issue=7143 |pages=396\u20138 |date=May 2007 |pmid=17522671 |doi=10.1038/nature05913 }}</ref>\n\n===Sexual dimorphism===\n:''For information about how males and females develop differences throughout the lifespan, see [[sexual differentiation]].''\nSexual dimorphism (two forms) refers to the general phenomenon in which male and female forms of an organism display distinct morphological characteristics or features.\n\nSexual dimorphism in humans is the subject of much controversy, especially relating to mental ability and psychological gender. (For a discussion, see [[sexual dimorphism|biology of gender]], [[sex and intelligence]], [[gender]], and [[transgender]].) Obvious differences between men and women include all the features related to reproductive role, notably the endocrine (hormonal) systems and their physical, psychological and behavioral effects. Although sex is a binary dichotomy, with \"male\" and \"female\" representing opposite and complementary sex categories for the purpose of reproduction, a small number of individuals have an anatomy that does not conform to either male or female standards, or contains features closely associated with both. Such individuals, described as [[intersexuals]], are sometimes infertile but are often capable of reproducing.  The current estimated rate for intersexuality is about 1 in 1500 to 1 in 2000 births.  There are a greater number of individuals, however, who have a subtler variation of their assigned sex.  These variations are not always present at birth.<ref>[http://www.isna.org/faq/frequency How common is intersex? | Intersex Society of North America<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Intersexuality is not often discussed or witnessed in Western culture because when an intersexual baby is born, surgery is usually performed within the first 24 hours to assign a sex to the baby.<ref name=Fausto-Sterling>{{cite book|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|title=Sexing the body: gender politics and the construction of sexuality|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780465077137|url-access=registration|year=2000|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, NY|pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780465077137/page/45 45]}}</ref>\n\n==Evolution of sexual dimorphism in human voice pitch==\nThe pitch of a male voice is about half as high in males in comparison to females.<ref>Titze, I.

One difference is the proportions of [[white matter]] relative to [[grey matter]].]]\n\nStructural brain differences usually correspond to sexually dimorphic attributes that bring about functional brain differences.\n\nOn average, female brains have a larger ratio of grey matter to white matter than males (particularly in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and superior temporal gyrus), even when sex-differences in total intracranial volume are taken into consideration. Most notably, males have a larger amount of white matter in the frontal and temporal [[perisylvian region]], and in the temporal stem and optic radiation, of the left hemisphere, whereas females have a larger amount of gray matter in the [[superior temporal gyrus]], [[planum temporale]], [[Heschl gyrus]], [[cingulate gyrus]], [[Inferior frontal gyrus|inferior frontal]], and [[Central sulcus|central sulci]] margins, of the left hemisphere.\n\nThe degree of [[brain asymmetry|hemispheric asymmetry]] in males corresponds to the relative size of [[corpus callosum]]; however, this is not true in females. An increase in hemispheric asymmetry in male brains causes a male sex-dependent decrease in inter-hemispheric connectivity. Numerous studies suggest that, on average, female brains have more [[commissural tract]]s involved in inter-hemispheric connectivity than males. More specifically, it suggests that: the [[anterior commissure]] is larger in females than males; [[massa intermedia]] is more abundant in females than males; females have a larger ratio of cross-sectional area of the corpus callosum to cerebral volume and to forebrain size than males. Although, fewer studies have alternatively found otherwise.\n\nTypically, male brains are more asymmetric than female brains. Females have less asymmetry than males between left and right hemispheric cortical thickness. Males have a larger intra-hemispheric long-range interconnectivity than females, whereas females have a larger inter-hemispheric connectivity. Males have larger left hemispheric asymmetries than females in various brain areas, including the superior temporal gyrus, Heschl gyrus, deeper central sulcus, overall temporal and parietal and [[inferior parietal lobule]], [[thalamus]] and [[posterior cingulate]].  Although, fewer studies have alternatively found otherwise.\n\nThere are also differences in the structure of and in specific areas of the brain. On average, the [[Sexually dimorphic nucleus|SDN]] has been repeatedly found to be considerably larger in males than in females. The volume of the SDN was 2.2 times as large in males as in females. On average, the [[Stria terminalis#Bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST)|BSTc]] is twice as large in men as in women. On average, the [[INAH 3|INAH-3]] is significantly larger in males than in females regardless of age. Two studies found that men have larger [[parietal lobe]]s, an area responsible for sensory input including spatial sense and navigation; though, another study failed to find any statistically significant difference.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Frederikse ME |author2=Lu A |author3=Aylward E |author4=Barta P |author5=Pearlson G |title=Sex differences in the inferior parietal lobule |journal=Cereb.

The male amygdala is proportionally larger than that in women, causing sex to be a determining factor in reactions to stress. In studies of rats, there are more numerous interconnections seen in males in regard to this structure, suggesting the same pattern in humans. Katharina Braun and company (Otto von Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany) studied a litter of [[Common degu|Degu]] puppies removed from their mother and determined that hearing their mother's call produced a higher concentration of serotonin in males' amygdala and a decreased concentration in females' amygdala. In this case, stress causes females' emotion regulation to drop, while males seem to keep more of an even keel. While this study was limited to rodents, it provides a possible explanation of why anxiety disorders occur more often among human females than males.<ref name=\"scientificamerican.com\">{{cite journal | last1 = Cahill | first1 = Larry | title = His Brain, Her Brain | url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=his-brain-her-brain | journal = Scientific American | year = 2005 | issue =  3| pages = 40\u201347 | doi = 10.1038/scientificamericanmind0509-40 | volume = 20 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120317023332/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=his-brain-her-brain | archivedate = 2012-03-17 }} {{cite journal | last1 = Alexander | first1 = Gerianne M. | last2 = Hines | first2 = Melissa | year = 2002 | title = Sex differences in response to children's toys in nonhuman primates (Cercopithecus aethiops sabaeus)| url = | journal = Evolution and Human Behavior | volume = 23 | issue = 6| pages = 467\u2013479 | doi=10.1016/s1090-5138(02)00107-1}}</ref> Also, the hypothalamus and frontomedial area, both of which are associated with emotional processing, are larger in males than females. Other brain areas related to emotion, such as the orbitofrontal cortex, medial paralimbic region and hippocampus are larger in females than males.\n\nThe hippocampus has been proven by imaging to be larger in women than men. The hippocampus is crucial for memory storage and spatial mapping of the physical environment. This structural difference may be responsible for variations in behavior between the sexes. Studies show that women are more likely to navigate using landmarks, while men are more likely to estimate distance in space or orientation. Studies of rats show that males could learn better in the face of acute stress, while chronic stress is dealt with better by females. Sex hormones may influence female hippocampal cells to tolerate brain damage better than the same cells in men. The studies of the rats' influx and deflation of hippocampal cells can be translated to the difference in memory and spatial behaviors between the sexes.<ref name=\"scientificamerican.com\"/>\n\nOn average, [[Onuf\u2019s nucleus]] is sexually dimorphic, meaning that there are differences in Onuf\u2019s nucleus between males and females of the same species. Males of these species have more of these motoneurons than do their female counterparts.\n\n=====Brain connectivity=====\n\nResearch done at the Medical School of [[University of Pennsylvania]] found substantial differences in brain connectivity between males and females in 2013. The study examined 949 individuals (521 females and 428 males) of ages between 8 and 22. Overall, male brains showed better connectivity from back to front and within [[Brain hemisphere|hemisphere]]s, while female brains showed more connectivity between left and right hemispheres of the cerebrum. In contrast to connectivity to the [[cerebrum]], in the [[cerebellum]], the part of the brain that plays a major role in motor task, males showed higher inter-hemispheric connectivity while females showed higher intra-hemispheric connectivity. The differences were more pronounced in people aged 14 or older.<ref name=upenn>{{cite web|title=Brain Connectivity Study Reveals Striking Differences Between Men and Women|url=http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/news/News_Releases/2013/12/verma/|website=Perelman School of Medicine / University of Pennsylvania|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|accessdate=21 November 2015|ref=upenn}}</ref><ref name=psehizo>{{cite web|last1=Paul|first1=Ian|title=Is gender difference innate?|url=http://www.psephizo.com/gender-2/is-gender-difference-innate/|website=Psephizo|accessdate=21 November 2015|ref=psephizo|date=October 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe researchers stated that these findings potentially provide neural basis for observable sex differences in psychology. The research was consistent with previous studies that found that females performed better than males on tasks of attention, face and word memory, and social cognition tests, while males performed better on spatial processing and sensorimotor skill tasks. On average, men outperformed women at learning and accomplishing single tasks, like cycling and navigating directions, while females had better memory and social cognition skills making them more adjusted to multitasking and coming up with consensus solutions. It has been suggested that the increased differentiation of brain connectivity in adolescence is in correlation with hormonal changes in [[puberty]].<ref name=upenn /><ref name=psehizo />\n\nA 2014 study by the same research group using [[MRI|rsfc-MRI]] (resting-state functional connectivity MRI) found similar results to the previous one, with males on average outperforming females on [[Motor skill|motor]] and [[Spatial cognition|spatial cognitive]] tests, and females on average outperforming males on [[Emotion Recognition|emotional recognition]] and nonverbal reasoning tasks.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Satterthwaite TD, Wolf DH, Roalf DR, Ruparel K, Erus G, Vandekar S, Gennatas ED, Elliott MA, Smith A, Hakonarson H, Verma R, Davatzikos C, Gur RE, Gur RC |title=Linked Sex Differences in Cognition and Functional Connectivity in Youth |journal=Cereb.

Several genes that code for differences between male and female brains have been identified. In the [[human brain]], a difference between sexes was observed in the [[gene transcription|transcription]] of the [[PCDH11X]]/Y gene pair, a pair unique to ''[[Homo sapiens]]''.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lopes | first1 = Alexandra M. | last2 = Ross | year = 2006 | first2 = Norman | last3 = Close | first3 = James | last4 = Dagnall | first4 = Adam | last5 = Amorim | first5 = Ant\u00f3nio | last6 = Crow | first6 = Timothy J. | title = Inactivation status of PCDH11X: sexual dimorphisms in gene expression levels in brain | url = | journal = Human Genetics | volume = 119 | issue = 3| pages = 1\u20139 |pmid = 16425037 | doi = 10.1007/s00439-006-0134-0 }}</ref> It has been argued{{By whom|date=August 2010}} that the Y chromosome is primarily responsible for males being more susceptible to [[mental illnesses]]. Several psychological studies contradict this however, as it has been found that female patients are actually more than twice as likely as male patients to be susceptible to depressive episodes and generalized anxiety, and additionally that progesterone levels in females actually stall the body's ability to turn off stressor hormones resulting in female subjects entering depressive episodes at even lower levels of stress than male subjects.<ref>[http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200307/more-women-suffer-depression More Women Suffer Depression | Psychology Today<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nHormones significantly affect human brain formation, as well as brain development at puberty. A 2004 review in ''[[Nature Reviews Neuroscience]]'' observed that \"because it is easier to manipulate hormone levels than the expression of sex chromosome genes, the effects of hormones have been studied much more extensively, and are much better understood, than the direct actions in the brain of sex chromosome genes.\" It concluded that while \"the differentiating effects of gonadal secretions seem to be\ndominant,\" the existing body of research \"support the idea that sex differences in neural expression\nof X and Y genes significantly contribute to sex differences in brain functions and disease.\"<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nrn1494 | last1 = Arnold | first1 = A.

Research done on vervet monkeys showed that male and female monkeys gravitated towards sex-typical preferred toys. This study controls for external societal influence by using monkeys as the subject, and projects results to humans, the closest animal relative. A separate study was done on one-day-old infants to see if infants diverted attention differently between the sexes. Results showed that there must be some innate mechanism that differs between the sexes. This innate mechanism is evolutionary in the sense that the hormones for females are concurrently passed down to other females, and the same with males.<ref name=\"scientificamerican.com\"/>\n\nOther than external genitals, there are few physical differences before puberty.  Small differences in height and start of physical maturity are seen.  In the first decade of human life there is a significant amount of overlap between children of both sexes.  The gradual growth in sex difference throughout a person's life is a product of various hormones.  [[Testosterone]] is the major active hormone in male development while [[estrogen]] is the dominant female hormone.  These hormones are not, however, limited to each sex.  Both males and females have both testosterone and estrogen.<ref>Birke, Lydia. The Gender and Science Reader  ed. Muriel Lederman and Ingrid Bartsch. New York, Routledge,  2001. 314-315.</ref>\n\n==Sensory systems==\n{{Main|Sex differences in sensory systems}}\n* Some studies have shown that females have a more sensitive sense of smell than males, both in the differentiation of odors, and in the detection of slight or faint odors.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1796447.stm | work=BBC News | title=Women nose ahead in smell tests | date=2002-02-04 | accessdate=2010-05-23}}</ref> \n* Females have more pain receptors in the skin.

The conclusions draws from them could be derivative of gender role expectations of pain and not sex differences.  While most women expect to be less tolerant, men expect to be more tolerant and therefore report agitation later. Due to variation across societies of gender roles, results of pain studies also vary depending on gender expectations.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Defrin R, Shramm L, Eli I |title=Gender role expectations of pain is associated with pain tolerance limit but not with pain threshold |journal=Pain |volume=145 |issue=1\u20132 |pages=230\u20136 |date=September 2009 |pmid=19615821 |doi=10.1016/j.pain.2009.06.028 }}</ref>\n* Females also report a higher prevalence of many pain-related diseases and syndromes, particularly auto-immune diseases. In a 2005 study, Holdcroft and Beckley show a higher female prevalence of many conditions of the head and neck (e.g., [[migraine]]), limbs (e.g., [[carpal tunnel syndrome]]), internal organs (IBS), and more general conditions ([[multiple sclerosis]]).<ref>McMahon SB, M Koltzenburg,  A Holdcroft, and K Beckley.

Therefore, studies consistently find that women report more severe pain, more frequent pain, longer-lasting pain, and wider-ranging pain than men.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kr\u00f6ner-Herwig | first1 = Birgit | last2 = Ga\u00dfmann | first2 = Jennifer | last3 = Tromsdorf | first3 = Marie | last4 = Zahrend | first4 = Elfi | year = 2012 | title = The effects of sex and gender role on responses to pressure pain | journal = GMS Psycho-Social-Medicine | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 1\u201310 | pmc = 3290921 | pmid=22400065 | doi=10.3205/psm000079}}</ref> For example, common painful conditions such as [[dysmenorrhea]] may predispose females to more widespread musculoskeletal pains.\n*Women show higher performance levels on tests of verbal fluency. This may be because the female auditory cortex is more dense than that of the male.

One possible explanation is the generally more risky behavior engaged in by males. More males than females die young because of war, criminal activity, and accidents. However, the gap between males and females is decreasing in many developed countries as more women take up unhealthy practices that were once considered masculine like smoking and drinking alcohol.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4252036.stm Lifestyle 'hits life length gap'] BBC September 16, 2005</ref> In Russia, however, the sex-associated gap has been increasing as male life expectancy declines.<ref>[http://www.newtimes.ru/eng/detail.asp?art_id=1537 A Country of Widows] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060415083231/http://www.newtimes.ru/eng/detail.asp?art_id=1537 |date=2006-04-15 }} Viktor Perevedentsev, New Times, May 2006</ref>\n\nThe longer average life span of women can lead to skewed statistical results in regards to sex difference.

Some conditions are [[X-linked recessive]], in that the gene is carried on the X chromosome. Genetic females (XX) will show symptoms of the disease only if both their X chromosomes are defective with a similar deficiency, whereas genetic males (XY) will show symptoms of the disease if their only X chromosome is defective. (A woman may carry such a disease on one X chromosome but not show symptoms if the other X chromosome works sufficiently.)

There is no significant gender difference in rates of [[schizophrenia]] and [[bipolar depression]]. Women are more likely to suffer from [[unipolar depression]], [[anxiety]], [[eating disorders]], and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]. Men are more likely to suffer from [[alcoholism]] and [[antisocial personality disorder]], as well as developmental psychiatric disorders such as [[autism spectrum disorder]]s and [[Tourette syndrome]].\n*Women are more likely to suffer from depression, due in part to low social status being such a powerful predictor for depression.\n*While men are more likely to suffer from alcoholism, women are more prone to addiction. This is because estrogen boosts the release of dopamine in brain regions important for regulating drug-seeking behavior, making women more vulnerable to dependence.\n*Schizophrenia does not show prevalence differences of significance among sexes, but there is a difference in the brain structures related. Women naturally have a higher orbitofrontal-to-amygdala ratio (OAR) than men, but not schizophrenic women (lower OAR). Men with schizophrenia however, have a higher orbitofrontal-to-amygdala ratio than that of healthy men.\n<ref name=\"scientificamerican.com\"/>\n\n* Before [[menopause]], women are less likely to suffer from [[cardiovascular disease]]. However, after age 60, the risk for both men and women is the same.\n* Overall, men are more likely to suffer from [[cancer]], with much of this driven by [[lung cancer]]. In most countries, more men than women [[Tobacco smoking|smoke]], although this gap is narrowing especially among young women.\n* Women are twice as likely to be [[Blindness|blind]] as men. In developed countries, this may be linked to higher life expectancy and age-related conditions. In developing countries, women are less likely to get timely treatments for conditions that lead to blindness such as cataracts and [[trachoma]].\n* Women are more likely to suffer from [[osteoarthritis]] and [[osteoporosis]].  The density of bones depends upon the stresses that are put on them through exercise.  Exercise and activity in childhood helps to build up higher density bones.  Although in Britain women's bones are less dense even before menopause, in some African societies, men and women are equally susceptible to osteoporosis.<ref>Birke, Lydia.

Paddar later became known for its [[sapphire]] [[Mining|mines]]. But this was a mere sideshow to General Zorawar Singh's more famous expeditions, on which he had already embarked in the previous year.\n\n==The Ladakh campaigns==\n[[File:Zorawerfort.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Zorawar fort in Ladakh]]\nTo the east of Kishtwar and Kashmir are the snow-clad mountains of the upper [[Himalayas]] \u2014 the rivers of [[Zanskar Gorge]], [[Suru River (Indus)|Suru River]], and [[Dras River|Drass]] rise from these snows, and flow across the plateau of [[Ladakh]] into the Indus River. Several petty principalities in this region were tributary to the Gyalpo (King) of Ladakh.  In 1834 one of these, the Raja of Timbus, sought Zorawar's help against the Gyalpo. Meanwhile, the Rajput general had been burning to distinguish himself by expanding the territory of Raja [[Gulab Singh]] \u2014 also at that time, according to the Gulabnama, Kishtwar went through a drought that caused a loss of revenue and forced Zorawar to extract money through war.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Art of Generalship|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uAmqCQAAQBAJ|publisher = Vij Books India Pvt Ltd|date = 2015-05-07|isbn = 9789382652939|first = K.

The astute general doubled back to Kartse, where he sheltered his troops through the winter. In the spring of 1835 he defeated the large Ladakhi army of Banko Kahlon and marched his victorious troops towards [[Leh]]. The Gyalpo now agreed to pay 50,000 rupees as war-indemnity and 20,000 rupees as an annual tribute.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAlarmed at the gains of the [[Dogra]]s, the governor of Kashmir, Mehan Singh, incited the Ladakhi chieftains to rebel but Zorawar quickly marched back to the Himalayan valleys and subdued the rebels, now forcing the Raja of Zanskar to also pay a separate tribute to Jammu. But in 1836 Mehan Singh, who was in correspondence with the Lahore durbar, this time instigated the Gyalpo to revolt \u2014 Zorawar force-marched his army in ten days to surprise the Ladakhis and forced them to submit. He now built a fort outside Leh and placed there a garrison of 300 men under Dalel Singh \u2014 the Gyalpo was deposed to an estate and a Ladakhi general, Ngorub Stanzin, was made King. But the latter did not prove to be loyal hence the Gyalpo was restored to his throne in 1838.\n'''\n\n==Baltistan campaign==\nTo the northwest of Ladakh, and to the north of Kashmir, lies the region of [[Baltistan]]. Muhammad Shah, the son of the ruler of [[Skardu]], Raja Ahmad Shah, fled to Leh and sought the aid of the Gyalpo and Zorawar against his father. But some of the Ladakhi nobles allowed Ahmad Shah to imprison his son and sought his aid in a general rebellion against the Dogras. After defeating the Ladakhi rebels Zorawar invaded Baltistan in the winter of 1839/40 (Petech, Kingdom of ladakh, p.&nbsp;144, Datta, Ladakh, p.&nbsp;122 etc. etc.), adding a large contingent of Ladakhis to his army.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Buddhist Western Himalaya: A politico-religious history|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=R4VuovXa5YUC|publisher = Indus Publishing|date = 2001|isbn = 9788173871245|page = 194}}</ref>\n\nThe advance brigade of 5,000 under Nidhan Singh lost its way in the cold and snow and was surrounded by the enemy; many soldiers perished from the cold. Then Mehta Basti Ram, a prominent Rajput from Kishtwar, established contact with the main force. On their arrival the [[Botis]] of Skardu were defeated and forced to flee. They were chased to the fort of Skardu which was invested by Zorawar for a few days. One night the Dogras scaled the steep mountain behind the fort and after some fighting captured the small fort on its crest. From this position the next day they began firing down at the main fort and forced the Raja to surrender. Zorawar built a fort on the banks of the Indus where he placed a contingent of his soldiers.\n\nAfter placing Muhammad Shah on the throne for an annual tribute of 7000 rupees, a Dogra contingent under Wazir Lakhpat advanced westwards, conquered the fort of Astor and took its Darad Raja prisoner. However this Raja was tributary to Mehan Singh, the governor of Kashmir, who was alarmed at the Dogra conquests since they only expanded the kingdom of Gulab Singh while not bringing any benefit to the Lahore durbar. His complaint at [[Lahore]] was forwarded to Raja Gulab Singh at Jammu and he ordered the Darad Raja to be released.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title = General Zorawar Singh|url = https://archive.org/details/generalzorawarsi00char|publisher = Publications Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India|date = 1983|first = Sukh Dev Singh|last = Charak}}</ref>\n\n==Tibet expedition==\n{{Main|Sino-Sikh war}}\nZorawar Singh turned his energies eastward, towards [[Tibet]].

Another column of 300 men, under Ghulam Khan, marched along the mountains leading up to the [[Kailas Range]] and thus south of the Indus. Zorawar himself led 3,000 men along the plateau region where the vast and picturesque [[Pangong Tso|Pangong Lake]] is located. Sweeping all resistance before them, the three columns passed the [[Lake Manasarovar]] and converged at [[Gartok]], defeating the small Tibetan force stationed there. The enemy commander fled to [[Taklakot]] but Zorawar stormed that fort on 6 September 1841. Envoys from Tibet now came to him as did agents of the Maharaja of [[Nepal]], whose kingdom was only fifteen miles from Taklakot.\n\nThe fall of Taklakot finds mention in the report of the Chinese Imperial Resident, Meng Pao, at [[Lhasa]]:<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=yKPdw2EkTwoC&pg=PA31&dq=On+my+arrival+at+Taklakot+a+force+of+only+about+1,000+local+troops+could+be+mustered,+which+was+divided+and+stationed+as+guards+at+different+posts&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sGWnUaPYIM_PrQe814HgCg&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=On%20my%20arrival%20at%20Taklakot%20a%20force%20of%20only%20about%201%2C000%20local%20troops%20could%20be%20mustered%2C%20which%20was%20divided%20and%20stationed%20as%20guards%20at%20different%20posts&f=false Perspectives on South Asian Security by  Shanthie Mariey D'Souza, Rajsthree Jetly]</ref> <blockquote>\"''On my arrival at Taklakot a force of only about 1,000 local troops could be mustered, which was divided and stationed as guards at different posts.

The supplies for the Dogra army over such a long distance failed despite Zorawar's meticulous preparations.\n\nAs the intense cold, coupled with the rain, snow and lightning continued for weeks upon weeks, many of the soldiers lost their fingers and toes to frostbite. Others starved to death, while some burnt the wooden stock of their muskets to warm themselves. The Tibetans and their [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] allies regrouped and advanced to give battle, bypassing the Dogra fort of Chi-T\u2019ang. Zorawar and his men met them at the Battle of To-yo on 12 December 1841\u2014-in the early exchange of fire the Rajput general was wounded in his right shoulder but he grabbed a sword in his left hand.

But this was a mere sideshow to General Zorawar Singh's more famous expeditions, on which he had already embarked in the previous year.\n\n==The Ladakh campaigns==\n[[File:Zorawerfort.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Zorawar fort in Ladakh]]\nTo the east of Kishtwar and Kashmir are the snow-clad mountains of the upper [[Himalayas]] \u2014 the rivers of [[Zanskar Gorge]], [[Suru River (Indus)|Suru River]], and [[Dras River|Drass]] rise from these snows, and flow across the plateau of [[Ladakh]] into the Indus River. Several petty principalities in this region were tributary to the Gyalpo (King) of Ladakh.  In 1834 one of these, the Raja of Timbus, sought Zorawar's help against the Gyalpo. Meanwhile, the Rajput general had been burning to distinguish himself by expanding the territory of Raja [[Gulab Singh]] \u2014 also at that time, according to the Gulabnama, Kishtwar went through a drought that caused a loss of revenue and forced Zorawar to extract money through war.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Art of Generalship|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uAmqCQAAQBAJ|publisher = Vij Books India Pvt Ltd|date = 2015-05-07|isbn = 9789382652939|first = K.

The astute general doubled back to Kartse, where he sheltered his troops through the winter. In the spring of 1835 he defeated the large Ladakhi army of Banko Kahlon and marched his victorious troops towards [[Leh]]. The Gyalpo now agreed to pay 50,000 rupees as war-indemnity and 20,000 rupees as an annual tribute.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAlarmed at the gains of the [[Dogra]]s, the governor of Kashmir, Mehan Singh, incited the Ladakhi chieftains to rebel but Zorawar quickly marched back to the Himalayan valleys and subdued the rebels, now forcing the Raja of Zanskar to also pay a separate tribute to Jammu. But in 1836 Mehan Singh, who was in correspondence with the Lahore durbar, this time instigated the Gyalpo to revolt \u2014 Zorawar force-marched his army in ten days to surprise the Ladakhis and forced them to submit. He now built a fort outside Leh and placed there a garrison of 300 men under Dalel Singh \u2014 the Gyalpo was deposed to an estate and a Ladakhi general, Ngorub Stanzin, was made King. But the latter did not prove to be loyal hence the Gyalpo was restored to his throne in 1838.\n'''\n\n==Baltistan campaign==\nTo the northwest of Ladakh, and to the north of Kashmir, lies the region of [[Baltistan]]. Muhammad Shah, the son of the ruler of [[Skardu]], Raja Ahmad Shah, fled to Leh and sought the aid of the Gyalpo and Zorawar against his father. But some of the Ladakhi nobles allowed Ahmad Shah to imprison his son and sought his aid in a general rebellion against the Dogras. After defeating the Ladakhi rebels Zorawar invaded Baltistan in the winter of 1839/40 (Petech, Kingdom of ladakh, p.&nbsp;144, Datta, Ladakh, p.&nbsp;122 etc. etc.), adding a large contingent of Ladakhis to his army.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Buddhist Western Himalaya: A politico-religious history|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=R4VuovXa5YUC|publisher = Indus Publishing|date = 2001|isbn = 9788173871245|page = 194}}</ref>\n\nThe advance brigade of 5,000 under Nidhan Singh lost its way in the cold and snow and was surrounded by the enemy; many soldiers perished from the cold. Then Mehta Basti Ram, a prominent Rajput from Kishtwar, established contact with the main force. On their arrival the [[Botis]] of Skardu were defeated and forced to flee. They were chased to the fort of Skardu which was invested by Zorawar for a few days. One night the Dogras scaled the steep mountain behind the fort and after some fighting captured the small fort on its crest. From this position the next day they began firing down at the main fort and forced the Raja to surrender. Zorawar built a fort on the banks of the Indus where he placed a contingent of his soldiers.\n\nAfter placing Muhammad Shah on the throne for an annual tribute of 7000 rupees, a Dogra contingent under Wazir Lakhpat advanced westwards, conquered the fort of Astor and took its Darad Raja prisoner. However this Raja was tributary to Mehan Singh, the governor of Kashmir, who was alarmed at the Dogra conquests since they only expanded the kingdom of Gulab Singh while not bringing any benefit to the Lahore durbar. His complaint at [[Lahore]] was forwarded to Raja Gulab Singh at Jammu and he ordered the Darad Raja to be released.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title = General Zorawar Singh|url = https://archive.org/details/generalzorawarsi00char|publisher = Publications Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India|date = 1983|first = Sukh Dev Singh|last = Charak}}</ref>\n\n==Tibet expedition==\n{{Main|Sino-Sikh war}}\nZorawar Singh turned his energies eastward, towards [[Tibet]].

Another column of 300 men, under Ghulam Khan, marched along the mountains leading up to the [[Kailas Range]] and thus south of the Indus. Zorawar himself led 3,000 men along the plateau region where the vast and picturesque [[Pangong Tso|Pangong Lake]] is located. Sweeping all resistance before them, the three columns passed the [[Lake Manasarovar]] and converged at [[Gartok]], defeating the small Tibetan force stationed there. The enemy commander fled to [[Taklakot]] but Zorawar stormed that fort on 6 September 1841. Envoys from Tibet now came to him as did agents of the Maharaja of [[Nepal]], whose kingdom was only fifteen miles from Taklakot.\n\nThe fall of Taklakot finds mention in the report of the Chinese Imperial Resident, Meng Pao, at [[Lhasa]]:<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=yKPdw2EkTwoC&pg=PA31&dq=On+my+arrival+at+Taklakot+a+force+of+only+about+1,000+local+troops+could+be+mustered,+which+was+divided+and+stationed+as+guards+at+different+posts&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sGWnUaPYIM_PrQe814HgCg&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=On%20my%20arrival%20at%20Taklakot%20a%20force%20of%20only%20about%201%2C000%20local%20troops%20could%20be%20mustered%2C%20which%20was%20divided%20and%20stationed%20as%20guards%20at%20different%20posts&f=false Perspectives on South Asian Security by  Shanthie Mariey D'Souza, Rajsthree Jetly]</ref> <blockquote>\"''On my arrival at Taklakot a force of only about 1,000 local troops could be mustered, which was divided and stationed as guards at different posts.

Others starved to death, while some burnt the wooden stock of their muskets to warm themselves. The Tibetans and their [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] allies regrouped and advanced to give battle, bypassing the Dogra fort of Chi-T\u2019ang. Zorawar and his men met them at the Battle of To-yo on 12 December 1841\u2014-in the early exchange of fire the Rajput general was wounded in his right shoulder but he grabbed a sword in his left hand.

However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br/>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}<br>(4) {{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918055745/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archivedate=2018-09-18|url-status=live|title=The Egyptian Illusion|last=Martel|first=Erich|work=Opinions|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1994-02-20|accessdate=2018-09-17|quote=Teachers who want reliable information on African American history often don't know where to turn.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://archive.org/stream/bulletinunitedst2311964unit#page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1964.]<br>(2) [http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007223056/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf |date=October 7, 2017 }}<br>(3) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1971.]<br>(4) Bedini, 1991.<br>(5) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/n7/mode/1up Bedini,1999.]<br>(6) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095152/http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Benjamin-Banneker-African-American/dp/0938420593#customerReviews Murdock]<br>(7) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233224/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=567 Toscano, 2000.]<br>(8) [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008.]</ref>\n\nIn a 1969 publication, Bedini reported that a story connecting Banneker with the survey and planning of the federal city had appeared within a work that a member of the Ellicott family had edited.

The paper stated:\n\n<blockquote> ... L'Enfant made a demand that could not be accorded and ... in a fit of high dudgeon gathered all his plans and papers and unceremoniously left. ... Washington was in despair, since it involved a defeat of all of his cherished plans in regard to the \"Federal City.\" This perturbation on his part was quickly ended, however, when it transpired that Banneker had daily for the purposes of calculation and practice, transcribed nearly all L'Enfant's field notes and through the assistance they afforded Mr. Andrew Ellicott, L'Enfant's assistant, Washington City was laid down very nearly on the original lines. ...

Banneker worked closely with L'Enfant and his maps. But the bureaucrats of that day did not take kindly to a foreigner being given so much power and authority and they interfered in many frustrating ways.  This resulted in the highly sensitive and hot-tempered L'Enfant resigning his position and returning to France, taking all of the plans and maps with him. Everyone was dismayed and Jefferson called a meeting of the men involved. What was to be done? Start all over again after more than a year's work? Dispair and frustration showed on their faces. Suddenly Banneker asked, \"Did you like the plans that were made?\" All eyes turned to him. \"Of course, but we don't have them.\" \"I think I can reproduce them from memory\", said Banneker. The men were astounded and somewhat skeptical. Banneker then went home, and because of his remarkable memory, was able to reproduce all the plans in two days.

He was a farmer, a mathematician, an inventor, an astronomer, a writer, a surveyor, a scientist, and a humanitarian. When he surveyed the city of Washington with Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant, Banneker became one of the first black civil servants of the new nation. Along with a team, Banneker identified the boundaries of the capitol city. They installed intermittent stone markers along the perimeter of the District. .... In 1753, Banneker constructed one of the first entirely wooden clocks in America. .... Banneker's scientific research led him to write one of the first series of almanacs printed in the United States.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180321194817/https://www.nps.gov/places/sw-9-intermediate-boundary-stone-of-the-district-of-columbia.htm/index.htm|archive-date=March 21, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nHowever, historical research has shown that none of these legends can be correct.<ref name=Founders/><ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\">[https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up Bedini, 1999, p. 132-136.] \"An exhaustive search of government repositories, including the Public Buildings and Grounds files in the National Archives, and various collections in the Library of Congress, failed to turn up Banneker's name on any of the contemporary documents or records related to the selection, planning and survey of the City of Washington. Nor was he mentioned in any of the surviving correspondence and papers of Andre Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant. .... Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it. Equally untrue and in fact impossible is the legend that Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House. Jefferson during this period was in Philadelphia, the national capital in Washington had yet not been built, and there was no White House.\"</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969], pp. 7, 29.</ref> As Bedini reported in 1969, Ellicott's 1791 assignment was to produce a survey of a square, the length of whose sides would each be {{convert|10|mi|km|1}} (a \"ten mile square\").<ref name=Bedini22/> L'Enfant was to survey, design and lay out the national capital city within this square.<ref name=Bedini22/><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=GgULOzNSafMC&pg=PA50#v=onepage&q=Banneker&f=false Stewart, p. 50] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426112936/https://books.google.com/books?id=GgULOzNSafMC&pg=PA50 |date=April 26, 2016}}</ref> Ellicott and L'Enfant each worked independently under the supervision of the three Commissioners that President Washington had earlier appointed.<ref name=Bedini22/> Bedini could not find any evidence that showed that Banneker had ever worked with or for L'Enfant.<ref name=Bedini22/><ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\"/>\n\nBanneker left the federal capital area and returned to his home near [[Ellicott City, Maryland#History|Ellicott's Mills]] in April 1791.<ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\"/><ref name=Arnebeck>{{cite web|last=Arnebeck|first=Bob|url=http://dcswamp.blogspot.com/2017/01/seat-of-empire.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129062551/http://dcswamp.blogspot.com/2017/01/seat-of-empire.html|archivedate=2018-01-29|title=Washington Examined: Seat of Empire: the General and the Plan 1790 to 1801|date=2017-01-02|publisher=[[Blogger (service)|Blogger]]|accessdate=2018-01-29|quote=Meanwhile Andrew Ellicott, the nation's Surveyor General, finished surveying the boundary lines of the federal district, and joined L'Enfant in laying out the city.

A careful perusal of all known surviving correspondence and papers of Andrew Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant has likewise failed to reveal mention of Banneker.  This conclusively dispels the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Ellicott was able to reconstruct it in detail from Banneker's recollection.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br/>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}<br>(4) {{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918055745/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archivedate=2018-09-18|url-status=live|title=The Egyptian Illusion|last=Martel|first=Erich|work=Opinions|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1994-02-20|accessdate=2018-09-17|quote=Teachers who want reliable information on African American history often don't know where to turn.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://archive.org/stream/bulletinunitedst2311964unit#page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1964.]<br>(2) [http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007223056/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf |date=October 7, 2017 }}<br>(3) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1971.]<br>(4) Bedini, 1991.<br>(5) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/n7/mode/1up Bedini,1999.]<br>(6) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095152/http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Benjamin-Banneker-African-American/dp/0938420593#customerReviews Murdock]<br>(7) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233224/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=567 Toscano, 2000.]<br>(8) [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008.]</ref>\n\nIn a 1969 publication, Bedini reported that a story connecting Banneker with the survey and planning of the federal city had appeared within a work that a member of the Ellicott family had edited.

The paper stated:\n\n<blockquote> ... L'Enfant made a demand that could not be accorded and ... in a fit of high dudgeon gathered all his plans and papers and unceremoniously left. ... Washington was in despair, since it involved a defeat of all of his cherished plans in regard to the \"Federal City.\" This perturbation on his part was quickly ended, however, when it transpired that Banneker had daily for the purposes of calculation and practice, transcribed nearly all L'Enfant's field notes and through the assistance they afforded Mr. Andrew Ellicott, L'Enfant's assistant, Washington City was laid down very nearly on the original lines. ...

At Jefferson's request, Banneker was appointed as the third member of the team.<br/>The assignment was to define the boundaries of the new city and then design and lay out its streets and major buildings. Banneker worked closely with L'Enfant and his maps. But the bureaucrats of that day did not take kindly to a foreigner being given so much power and authority and they interfered in many frustrating ways.  This resulted in the highly sensitive and hot-tempered L'Enfant resigning his position and returning to France, taking all of the plans and maps with him. Everyone was dismayed and Jefferson called a meeting of the men involved. What was to be done? Start all over again after more than a year's work? Dispair and frustration showed on their faces. Suddenly Banneker asked, \"Did you like the plans that were made?\" All eyes turned to him. \"Of course, but we don't have them.\" \"I think I can reproduce them from memory\", said Banneker. The men were astounded and somewhat skeptical. Banneker then went home, and because of his remarkable memory, was able to reproduce all the plans in two days.

He was a farmer, a mathematician, an inventor, an astronomer, a writer, a surveyor, a scientist, and a humanitarian. When he surveyed the city of Washington with Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant, Banneker became one of the first black civil servants of the new nation. Along with a team, Banneker identified the boundaries of the capitol city. They installed intermittent stone markers along the perimeter of the District. .... In 1753, Banneker constructed one of the first entirely wooden clocks in America. .... Banneker's scientific research led him to write one of the first series of almanacs printed in the United States.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180321194817/https://www.nps.gov/places/sw-9-intermediate-boundary-stone-of-the-district-of-columbia.htm/index.htm|archive-date=March 21, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nHowever, historical research has shown that none of these legends can be correct.<ref name=Founders/><ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\">[https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up Bedini, 1999, p. 132-136.] \"An exhaustive search of government repositories, including the Public Buildings and Grounds files in the National Archives, and various collections in the Library of Congress, failed to turn up Banneker's name on any of the contemporary documents or records related to the selection, planning and survey of the City of Washington. Nor was he mentioned in any of the surviving correspondence and papers of Andre Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant. .... Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it. Equally untrue and in fact impossible is the legend that Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House. Jefferson during this period was in Philadelphia, the national capital in Washington had yet not been built, and there was no White House.\"</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969], pp. 7, 29.</ref> As Bedini reported in 1969, Ellicott's 1791 assignment was to produce a survey of a square, the length of whose sides would each be {{convert|10|mi|km|1}} (a \"ten mile square\").<ref name=Bedini22/> L'Enfant was to survey, design and lay out the national capital city within this square.<ref name=Bedini22/><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=GgULOzNSafMC&pg=PA50#v=onepage&q=Banneker&f=false Stewart, p. 50] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426112936/https://books.google.com/books?id=GgULOzNSafMC&pg=PA50 |date=April 26, 2016}}</ref> Ellicott and L'Enfant each worked independently under the supervision of the three Commissioners that President Washington had earlier appointed.<ref name=Bedini22/> Bedini could not find any evidence that showed that Banneker had ever worked with or for L'Enfant.<ref name=Bedini22/><ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\"/>\n\nBanneker left the federal capital area and returned to his home near [[Ellicott City, Maryland#History|Ellicott's Mills]] in April 1791.<ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\"/><ref name=Arnebeck>{{cite web|last=Arnebeck|first=Bob|url=http://dcswamp.blogspot.com/2017/01/seat-of-empire.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129062551/http://dcswamp.blogspot.com/2017/01/seat-of-empire.html|archivedate=2018-01-29|title=Washington Examined: Seat of Empire: the General and the Plan 1790 to 1801|date=2017-01-02|publisher=[[Blogger (service)|Blogger]]|accessdate=2018-01-29|quote=Meanwhile Andrew Ellicott, the nation's Surveyor General, finished surveying the boundary lines of the federal district, and joined L'Enfant in laying out the city.

unclear and misleading, and that the new recommendations are borne of political expediency instead of science.<ref name=\"nyt-ppe-shortage\" />\nMid-March, the CDC changed its guidance from stating earlier that regular surgical masks cannot protect a healthy person from infection to now saying that regular masks are \"an acceptable alternative\" when examining or treating a coronavirus patient. The change came given the shortages of the [[N95 mask]]s. The [[American Nurses Association]] sent a letter to Congress, saying there is concern \"that C.D.C. recommendations are based solely on supply chain and manufacturing challenges,\" and \"that these recommendations do not offer strategies to address the limited manufacturing and supply chain of necessary personal protective equipment.\"<ref name=\"nyt-ppe-shortage\" />\n\n===Hospitals and ventilators===\nIn 2020, hospitals in California hired rental ventilators and rationed N95 masks, raising complaints from nurses.

The [[American Nurses Association]] sent a letter to Congress, saying there is concern \"that C.D.C. recommendations are based solely on supply chain and manufacturing challenges,\" and \"that these recommendations do not offer strategies to address the limited manufacturing and supply chain of necessary personal protective equipment.\"<ref name=\"nyt-ppe-shortage\" />\n\n===Hospitals and ventilators===\nIn 2020, hospitals in California hired rental ventilators and rationed N95 masks, raising complaints from nurses.

Harrelson had arrived in the county with his attorney, former Kentucky Governor [[Louie B. Nunn]], an agent and a camera crew from [[CNN]]. While at a local hotel, Harrelson phoned the county sheriff, Junior Kilburn, to advise him of his intentions. Kilburn and deputy sheriff Danny Towsend arrived at the location where Harrelson informed them he would be. With the cameras rolling, Harrelson planted the hemp seeds into the ground. Once planted, Kilburn placed Harrelson under arrest for cultivating marijuana and booked him into the county jail. He was released on $200 bail the same day.

A few broad generalizations can be made. For contaminants requiring an [[incubation period]], symptoms may not manifest for hours to days, depending on the cause and on quantity of consumption. Longer incubation periods tend to cause sufferers to not associate the symptoms with the item consumed, so they may misattribute the symptoms to [[gastroenteritis]], for example.\n\nSymptoms often include vomiting, fever, and aches, and may include diarrhea. Bouts of vomiting can be repeated with an extended delay in between, because even if infected food was eliminated from the stomach in the first bout, [[microbe]]s, like [[bacteria]], (if applicable) can pass through the [[stomach]] into the [[intestine]] and begin to multiply. Some types of microbes stay in the intestine, some produce a [[toxin]] that is absorbed into the [[blood]]stream, and some can directly invade deeper body tissues.\n\n==Causes==\n{{see also|Pathogen}}\n[[File:Foodinfridgetext.jpg|thumb|Poorly stored food in a refrigerator]]\nFoodborne illness usually arises from improper handling, preparation, or [[food storage]]. Good [[hygiene]] practices before, during, and after food preparation can reduce the chances of contracting an illness. There is a consensus in the public health community that regular hand-washing is one of the most effective defenses against the spread of foodborne illness. The action of monitoring food to ensure that it will not cause foodborne illness is known as [[food safety]]. Foodborne disease can also be caused by a large variety of toxins that affect the environment.<ref>For foodborne illness caused by chemicals, see [[Food contaminants]].</ref>\n\nFurthermore, foodborne illness can be caused by [[pesticide]]s or [[medicine]]s in food and natural toxic substances such as [[mushroom poisoning|poisonous mushrooms]] or [[tetrodotoxin|reef fish]].\n\n===Bacteria===\n[[Bacteria]] are a common cause of foodborne illness. The [[United Kingdom]], in 2000, reported the individual bacteria involved as the following: ''[[Campylobacter jejuni]]'' 77.3%, ''[[Salmonella]]'' 20.9%, [[Escherichia coli O157:H7|''Escherichia coli'' O157:H7]] 1.4%, and all others less than 0.56%.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://food.gov.uk/enforcement/regulation/betregs/ria/ria2011/controllingecoliia2011 \n |access-date=14 August 2016 \n |title=Reducing the risk from ''E. coli'' 0157 \u2013 controlling cross-contamination \n |publisher=Food Standards Agency, United Kingdom \n |date=February 2011 \n |url-status=bot: unknown \n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416193433/http://food.gov.uk/enforcement/regulation/betregs/ria/ria2011/controllingecoliia2011 \n |archive-date=April 16, 2014 \n |df=mdy \n}}\n</ref>  In the past, bacterial infections were thought to be more prevalent because few places had the capability to test for [[norovirus]] and no active surveillance was being done for this particular agent. Toxins from bacterial infections are delayed because the bacteria need time to multiply. As a result, symptoms associated with intoxication are usually not seen until 12\u201372 hours or more after eating contaminated food. However, in some cases, such as Staphylococcal food poisoning, the onset of illness can be as soon as 30 minutes after ingesting contaminated food.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/diseases/staphylococcal.html |title=Staphylococcal Food Poisoning |access-date=3 July 2016 |publisher=U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}}</ref>\n\n[[File:SalmonellaNIAID.jpg|right|200px|thumb|''Salmonella'']]\nMost common bacterial foodborne pathogens are:\n*''[[Campylobacter|Campylobacter jejuni]]'' which can lead to secondary [[Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome]] and [[periodontitis]]<ref name=cazp>{{cite journal | vauthors = Humphrey T, O'Brien S, Madsen M | title = Campylobacters as zoonotic pathogens: a food production perspective | journal = International Journal of Food Microbiology | volume = 117 | issue = 3 | pages = 237\u201357 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17368847 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2007.01.006 }}</ref>\n*''[[Clostridium perfringens]]'', the \"cafeteria germ\"<ref name=USDA>\n{{cite web| title = Foodborne Illness: What Consumers Need to Know| work = USDA.gov| access-date = 14 August 2016| url = http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/foodborne-illness-and-disease/foodborne-illness-what-consumers-need-to-know/CT_Index}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kiu R, Caim S, Painset A, Pickard D, Swift C, Dougan G, Mather AE, Amar C, Hall LJ | display-authors = 6 | title = Clostridium perfringens in England and Wales over a 7-year period indicates distribution of clonal toxigenic strains in multiple outbreaks and extensive involvement of enterotoxin-encoding (CPE) plasmids | journal = Microbial Genomics | volume = 5 | issue = 10 | pages = e000297 | date = October 2019 | pmid = 31553300 | pmc = 6861862 | doi = 10.1099/mgen.0.000297 }}</ref>\n*''[[Salmonella]]'' [[spp.]] \u2013 its ''S. typhimurium'' infection is caused by consumption of eggs or poultry that are not adequately cooked or by other interactive human-animal pathogens<ref name=aoostpt>\n{{cite journal | vauthors = Tribe IG, Cowell D, Cameron P, Cameron S | title = An outbreak of Salmonella typhimurium phage type 135 infection linked to the consumption of raw shell eggs in an aged care facility | journal = Communicable Diseases Intelligence Quarterly Report | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | pages = 38\u20139 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11950200 | url = https://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cda-pubs-cdi-2002-cdi2601-cdi2601h.htm | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140217035354/https://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cda-pubs-cdi-2002-cdi2601-cdi2601h.htm | archive-date = February 17, 2014 }}\n</ref><ref name=sisaa>{{cite web| work = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention| title = Salmonella Infection (salmonellosis) and Animals| access-date = August 12, 2007| url = https://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/diseases/salmonellosis.htm| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070704172311/http://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/diseases/salmonellosis.htm| archive-date = July 4, 2007| url-status = dead}}</ref><ref name=rcfp>{{cite journal | vauthors = Doyle MP, Erickson MC | title = Reducing the carriage of foodborne pathogens in livestock and poultry | journal = Poultry Science | volume = 85 | issue = 6 | pages = 960\u201373 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16776463 | doi = 10.1093/ps/85.6.960 }}</ref>\n*''[[Escherichia coli O157:H7]]'' enterohemorrhagic (EHEC) which can cause [[hemolytic-uremic syndrome]]\n\nOther common bacterial foodborne pathogens are:\n*''[[Bacillus cereus]]''\n*''[[Escherichia coli]]'', other [[Virulence properties of escherichia coli|virulence properties]], such as enteroinvasive (EIEC), enteropathogenic (EPEC), enterotoxigenic (ETEC), enteroaggregative (EAEC or EAgEC)\n*''[[Listeria monocytogenes]]''\n*''[[Shigella]]'' spp.\n*''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''\n*''[[Staphylococcal enteritis]]''\n*''[[Streptococcus]]''\n*''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'', including O1 and non-O1\n*''[[Vibrio parahaemolyticus]]''\n*''[[Vibrio vulnificus]]''\n*''[[Yersinia enterocolitica]]'' and ''[[Yersinia pseudotuberculosis]]''\n\nLess common bacterial agents:\n*''[[Brucella]]'' spp.\n*''[[Corynebacterium ulcerans]]''\n*''[[Q fever|Coxiella burnetii]]'' or Q fever\n*''[[Plesiomonas shigelloides]]''\n\n==== Enterotoxins ====\n{{see also|Botulism}}\n\nIn addition to disease caused by direct bacterial infection, some foodborne illnesses are caused by [[enterotoxin]]s ([[exotoxin]]s targeting the intestines). Enterotoxins can produce illness even when the microbes that produced them have been killed. Symptom appearance varies with the toxin but may be rapid in onset, as in the case of enterotoxins of ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' in which symptoms appear in one to six hours.<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/food-poisoning/DS00981/DSECTION=causes Food poisoning: Causes].

This regulation includes:\n* [[traceability]]: in a final product, it must be possible to know the origin of the ingredients (originating farm, identification of the harvesting or of the animal) and where and when it was processed; the origin of the illness can thus be tracked and solved (and possibly penalized), and the final products can be removed from the sale if a problem is detected;\n* enforcement of hygiene procedures such as [[HACCP]] and the \"[[cold chain]]\";\n* power of control and of law enforcement of [[veterinarian]]s.\n\nIn August 2006, the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] approved [[Phage therapy]] which involves spraying meat with viruses that infect bacteria, and thus preventing infection. This has raised concerns, because without [[mandatory labelling]] consumers would not be aware that meat and poultry products have been treated with the spray.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/business/healthcare/feeds/ap/2006/08/18/ap2959720.html |title=FDA Says Viruses Safe for Treating Meat |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825040502/http://www.forbes.com/business/healthcare/feeds/ap/2006/08/18/ap2959720.html|archive-date=August 25, 2006|access-date=September 2, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAt home, prevention mainly consists of good [[food safety]] practices.

In general, freezing or refrigerating prevents virtually all bacteria from growing, and heating food sufficiently kills parasites, viruses, and most bacteria. Bacteria grow most rapidly at the range of temperatures between {{convert|40|and|140|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}, called the \"danger zone\". Storing food below or above the \"danger zone\" can effectively limit the production of toxins. For storing leftovers, the food must be put in shallow containers\nfor quick cooling and must be refrigerated within two hours. When food is reheated, it must reach an internal temperature of {{convert|165|F|C}} or until hot or steaming to kill bacteria.<ref>[http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/safe-food-handling/how-temperatures-affect-food/ct_index How Temperatures Affect Food].

The term mycotoxin is usually reserved for the toxic chemical products produced by fungi that readily colonize crops. Mycotoxins sometimes have important effects on human and animal health.  For example, an outbreak which occurred in the UK in 1960 caused the death of 100,000 turkeys which had consumed [[aflatoxin]]-contaminated peanut meal.

The study was funded by the Australian Department of Health, Food Standards Australia New Zealand and the NSW Food Authority.\n\nThe main causes were Norovirus, pathogenic Escherichia coli, Campylobacter spp. and non-typhoidal Salmonella spp., although the causes of approximately 80% of illnesses were unknown. Approximately 25% (90% CrI: 13%\u201342%) of the 15.9 million episodes of gastroenteritis that occur in Australia were estimated to be transmitted by contaminated food. This equates to an average of approximately one episode of foodborne gastroenteritis every five years per person. Data on the number of hospitalisations and deaths represent the occurrence of serious foodborne illness. Including gastroenteritis, non-gastroenteritis and sequelae, there were an estimated annual 31,920 (90% CrI: 29,500\u201335,500) hospitalisations due to foodborne illness and 86 (90% CrI: 70\u2013105) deaths due to foodborne illness circa 2010. This study concludes that these rates are similar to recent estimates in the US and Canada.\n\nA main aim of this study was to compare if foodborne illness incidence had increased over time. In this study, similar methods of assessment were applied to data from circa 2000, which showed that the rate of foodborne gastroenteritis had not changed significantly over time. Two key estimates were the total number of gastroenteritis episodes each year, and the proportion considered foodborne. In circa 2010, it was estimated that 25% of all episodes of gastroenteritis were foodborne. By applying this proportion of episodes due to food to the incidence of gastroenteritis circa 2000, there were an estimated 4.3 million (90% CrI: 2.2\u20137.3 million) episodes of foodborne gastroenteritis circa 2000, although credible intervals overlap with 2010. Taking into account changes in population size, applying these equivalent methods suggests a 17% decrease in the rate of foodborne gastroenteritis between 2000 and 2010, with considerable overlap of the 90% credible intervals.\n\nThis study replaces a previous estimate of 5.4 million cases of food-borne illness in Australia every year, causing:<ref>\n{{cite web | url=http://www.ozfoodnet.gov.au/internet/ozfoodnet/publishing.nsf/Content/reports-1/$FILE/foodborne_report.pdf | title=Food borne illness in Australia | publisher=OzFoodNet}}\n</ref>\n* 18,000 hospitalizations\n* 120 deaths (0.5 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants)\n* 2.1 million lost days off work\n* 1.2 million doctor consultations\n* 300,000 prescriptions for antibiotics.\n\nMost foodborne disease outbreaks in Australia have been linked to raw or minimally cooked eggs or poultry.<ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Astridge K, McPherson M, Kirk M |title=Foodborne disease outbreaks in Australia 2001-2009|journal=Food Australia|date=2011|volume=63 |issue=12|pages=44\u201350|display-authors=etal}}</ref> The [[Australian Food Safety Information Council]] estimates that one third of cases of food poisoning occur in the home<ref>{{cite web|title=Food Hygiene|url=https://www.bupa.com.au/health-and-wellness/health-information/healthy-living/nutrition/eating/doc/food-hygiene|website=BUPA|access-date=13 September 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151211131645/https://www.bupa.com.au/health-and-wellness/health-information/healthy-living/nutrition/eating/doc/food-hygiene|archive-date=December 11, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Comparison between countries===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" \n!

The origin of most sporadic cases is undetermined. In the United States, where people eat outside the home frequently, 58% of cases originate from commercial food facilities (2004 FoodNet data). An outbreak is defined as occurring when two or more people experience similar illness after consuming food from a common source.\n\nOften, a combination of events contributes to an outbreak, for example, food might be left at room temperature for many hours, allowing bacteria to [[multiplication|multiply]] which is compounded by inadequate cooking which results in a failure to kill the dangerously elevated bacterial levels.\n\nOutbreaks are usually identified when those affected know each other. However, more and more, outbreaks are identified by [[public health]] staff from unexpected increases in laboratory results for certain strains of bacteria. Outbreak detection and investigation in the United States is primarily handled by local health jurisdictions and is inconsistent from district to district. It is estimated that 1\u20132% of outbreaks are detected.\n\n==Society and culture==\n\n===United Kingdom===\n\nIn postwar Aberdeen (1964) a large-scale (>400 cases) outbreak of [[typhoid]] occurred, caused by contaminated [[corned beef]] which had been imported from [[Argentina]].<ref>\nSmith, David F.; Diack, H. Lesley and Pennington, T. Hugh (2005) ''Food Poisoning, Policy and Politics : Corned Beef and Typhoid in Britain in the 1960s''. Boydell Press. {{ISBN|1-84383-138-4}}{{page needed|date=November 2013}}\n</ref> The corned beef was placed in cans and because the cooling plant had failed, cold river water from the [[R\u00edo de la Plata|Plate estuary]] was used to cool the cans. One of the cans had a defect and the meat inside was contaminated. This meat was then sliced using a meat slicer in a shop in Aberdeen, and a lack of cleaning the machinery led to spreading the contamination to other meats cut in the slicer. These meats were then eaten by the people of Aberdeen who then became ill.\n\nSerious outbreaks of foodborne illness since the 1970s prompted key changes in UK [[food safety]] law. These included the death of 19 patients in the Stanley Royd Hospital outbreak<ref>{{cite web|url=http://briandeer.com/social/stanley-royd.htm|title=Food poison deaths probe may reveal NHS flaws|date=February 24, 1985|author=Brian Deer|work=The Sunday Times}}</ref> and the [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (BSE, mad cow disease) outbreak identified in the 1980s.

Experts cite increased handling of food by humans as a major contributor, leading to outbreaks of parasites such as ''E. coli'' and cyclospora which can only come from human fecal matter.\n\n===Organizations===\n\nThe [[World Health Organization]] Department of Food Safety and Zoonoses (FOS) provides scientific advice for organizations and the public on issues concerning the safety of food. Its mission is to lower the burden of foodborne disease, thereby strengthening the health security and sustainable development of Member States. Foodborne and waterborne diarrhoeal diseases kill an estimated 2.2 million people annually, most of whom are children. WHO works closely with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) to address food safety issues along the entire food production chain\u2014from production to consumption\u2014using new methods of risk analysis. These methods provide efficient, science-based tools to improve food safety, thereby benefiting both public health and economic development.\n\n===International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN)===\n\nThe International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) is a joint program of the WHO and FAO. INFOSAN has been connecting national authorities from around the globe since 2004, with the goal of preventing the international spread of contaminated food and foodborne disease and strengthening food safety systems globally. This is done by:\n\n# Promoting the rapid exchange of information during food safety events;\n# Sharing information on important food safety issues of global interest;\n# Promoting partnership and collaboration between countries; and\n# Helping countries strengthen their capacity to manage food safety risks.\n\nMembership to INFOSAN is voluntary, but is restricted to representatives from national and regional government authorities and requires an official letter of designation. INFOSAN seeks to reflect the multidisciplinary nature of food safety and promote intersectoral collaboration by requesting the designation of Focal Points in each of the respective national authorities with a stake in food safety, and a single Emergency Contact Point in the national authority with the responsibility for coordinating national food safety emergencies; countries choosing to be members of INFOSAN are committed to sharing information between their respective food safety authorities and other INFOSAN members.

A few broad generalizations can be made. For contaminants requiring an [[incubation period]], symptoms may not manifest for hours to days, depending on the cause and on quantity of consumption. Longer incubation periods tend to cause sufferers to not associate the symptoms with the item consumed, so they may misattribute the symptoms to [[gastroenteritis]], for example.\n\nSymptoms often include vomiting, fever, and aches, and may include diarrhea. Bouts of vomiting can be repeated with an extended delay in between, because even if infected food was eliminated from the stomach in the first bout, [[microbe]]s, like [[bacteria]], (if applicable) can pass through the [[stomach]] into the [[intestine]] and begin to multiply. Some types of microbes stay in the intestine, some produce a [[toxin]] that is absorbed into the [[blood]]stream, and some can directly invade deeper body tissues.\n\n==Causes==\n{{see also|Pathogen}}\n[[File:Foodinfridgetext.jpg|thumb|Poorly stored food in a refrigerator]]\nFoodborne illness usually arises from improper handling, preparation, or [[food storage]]. Good [[hygiene]] practices before, during, and after food preparation can reduce the chances of contracting an illness. There is a consensus in the public health community that regular hand-washing is one of the most effective defenses against the spread of foodborne illness. The action of monitoring food to ensure that it will not cause foodborne illness is known as [[food safety]]. Foodborne disease can also be caused by a large variety of toxins that affect the environment.<ref>For foodborne illness caused by chemicals, see [[Food contaminants]].</ref>\n\nFurthermore, foodborne illness can be caused by [[pesticide]]s or [[medicine]]s in food and natural toxic substances such as [[mushroom poisoning|poisonous mushrooms]] or [[tetrodotoxin|reef fish]].\n\n===Bacteria===\n[[Bacteria]] are a common cause of foodborne illness. The [[United Kingdom]], in 2000, reported the individual bacteria involved as the following: ''[[Campylobacter jejuni]]'' 77.3%, ''[[Salmonella]]'' 20.9%, [[Escherichia coli O157:H7|''Escherichia coli'' O157:H7]] 1.4%, and all others less than 0.56%.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://food.gov.uk/enforcement/regulation/betregs/ria/ria2011/controllingecoliia2011 \n |access-date=14 August 2016 \n |title=Reducing the risk from ''E. coli'' 0157 \u2013 controlling cross-contamination \n |publisher=Food Standards Agency, United Kingdom \n |date=February 2011 \n |url-status=bot: unknown \n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416193433/http://food.gov.uk/enforcement/regulation/betregs/ria/ria2011/controllingecoliia2011 \n |archive-date=April 16, 2014 \n |df=mdy \n}}\n</ref>  In the past, bacterial infections were thought to be more prevalent because few places had the capability to test for [[norovirus]] and no active surveillance was being done for this particular agent. Toxins from bacterial infections are delayed because the bacteria need time to multiply. As a result, symptoms associated with intoxication are usually not seen until 12\u201372 hours or more after eating contaminated food. However, in some cases, such as Staphylococcal food poisoning, the onset of illness can be as soon as 30 minutes after ingesting contaminated food.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/diseases/staphylococcal.html |title=Staphylococcal Food Poisoning |access-date=3 July 2016 |publisher=U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}}</ref>\n\n[[File:SalmonellaNIAID.jpg|right|200px|thumb|''Salmonella'']]\nMost common bacterial foodborne pathogens are:\n*''[[Campylobacter|Campylobacter jejuni]]'' which can lead to secondary [[Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome]] and [[periodontitis]]<ref name=cazp>{{cite journal | vauthors = Humphrey T, O'Brien S, Madsen M | title = Campylobacters as zoonotic pathogens: a food production perspective | journal = International Journal of Food Microbiology | volume = 117 | issue = 3 | pages = 237\u201357 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17368847 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2007.01.006 }}</ref>\n*''[[Clostridium perfringens]]'', the \"cafeteria germ\"<ref name=USDA>\n{{cite web| title = Foodborne Illness: What Consumers Need to Know| work = USDA.gov| access-date = 14 August 2016| url = http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/foodborne-illness-and-disease/foodborne-illness-what-consumers-need-to-know/CT_Index}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kiu R, Caim S, Painset A, Pickard D, Swift C, Dougan G, Mather AE, Amar C, Hall LJ | display-authors = 6 | title = Clostridium perfringens in England and Wales over a 7-year period indicates distribution of clonal toxigenic strains in multiple outbreaks and extensive involvement of enterotoxin-encoding (CPE) plasmids | journal = Microbial Genomics | volume = 5 | issue = 10 | pages = e000297 | date = October 2019 | pmid = 31553300 | pmc = 6861862 | doi = 10.1099/mgen.0.000297 }}</ref>\n*''[[Salmonella]]'' [[spp.]] \u2013 its ''S. typhimurium'' infection is caused by consumption of eggs or poultry that are not adequately cooked or by other interactive human-animal pathogens<ref name=aoostpt>\n{{cite journal | vauthors = Tribe IG, Cowell D, Cameron P, Cameron S | title = An outbreak of Salmonella typhimurium phage type 135 infection linked to the consumption of raw shell eggs in an aged care facility | journal = Communicable Diseases Intelligence Quarterly Report | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | pages = 38\u20139 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11950200 | url = https://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cda-pubs-cdi-2002-cdi2601-cdi2601h.htm | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140217035354/https://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cda-pubs-cdi-2002-cdi2601-cdi2601h.htm | archive-date = February 17, 2014 }}\n</ref><ref name=sisaa>{{cite web| work = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention| title = Salmonella Infection (salmonellosis) and Animals| access-date = August 12, 2007| url = https://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/diseases/salmonellosis.htm| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070704172311/http://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/diseases/salmonellosis.htm| archive-date = July 4, 2007| url-status = dead}}</ref><ref name=rcfp>{{cite journal | vauthors = Doyle MP, Erickson MC | title = Reducing the carriage of foodborne pathogens in livestock and poultry | journal = Poultry Science | volume = 85 | issue = 6 | pages = 960\u201373 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16776463 | doi = 10.1093/ps/85.6.960 }}</ref>\n*''[[Escherichia coli O157:H7]]'' enterohemorrhagic (EHEC) which can cause [[hemolytic-uremic syndrome]]\n\nOther common bacterial foodborne pathogens are:\n*''[[Bacillus cereus]]''\n*''[[Escherichia coli]]'', other [[Virulence properties of escherichia coli|virulence properties]], such as enteroinvasive (EIEC), enteropathogenic (EPEC), enterotoxigenic (ETEC), enteroaggregative (EAEC or EAgEC)\n*''[[Listeria monocytogenes]]''\n*''[[Shigella]]'' spp.\n*''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''\n*''[[Staphylococcal enteritis]]''\n*''[[Streptococcus]]''\n*''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'', including O1 and non-O1\n*''[[Vibrio parahaemolyticus]]''\n*''[[Vibrio vulnificus]]''\n*''[[Yersinia enterocolitica]]'' and ''[[Yersinia pseudotuberculosis]]''\n\nLess common bacterial agents:\n*''[[Brucella]]'' spp.\n*''[[Corynebacterium ulcerans]]''\n*''[[Q fever|Coxiella burnetii]]'' or Q fever\n*''[[Plesiomonas shigelloides]]''\n\n==== Enterotoxins ====\n{{see also|Botulism}}\n\nIn addition to disease caused by direct bacterial infection, some foodborne illnesses are caused by [[enterotoxin]]s ([[exotoxin]]s targeting the intestines).

This regulation includes:\n* [[traceability]]: in a final product, it must be possible to know the origin of the ingredients (originating farm, identification of the harvesting or of the animal) and where and when it was processed; the origin of the illness can thus be tracked and solved (and possibly penalized), and the final products can be removed from the sale if a problem is detected;\n* enforcement of hygiene procedures such as [[HACCP]] and the \"[[cold chain]]\";\n* power of control and of law enforcement of [[veterinarian]]s.\n\nIn August 2006, the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] approved [[Phage therapy]] which involves spraying meat with viruses that infect bacteria, and thus preventing infection.

The study was funded by the Australian Department of Health, Food Standards Australia New Zealand and the NSW Food Authority.\n\nThe main causes were Norovirus, pathogenic Escherichia coli, Campylobacter spp. and non-typhoidal Salmonella spp., although the causes of approximately 80% of illnesses were unknown. Approximately 25% (90% CrI: 13%\u201342%) of the 15.9 million episodes of gastroenteritis that occur in Australia were estimated to be transmitted by contaminated food. This equates to an average of approximately one episode of foodborne gastroenteritis every five years per person. Data on the number of hospitalisations and deaths represent the occurrence of serious foodborne illness. Including gastroenteritis, non-gastroenteritis and sequelae, there were an estimated annual 31,920 (90% CrI: 29,500\u201335,500) hospitalisations due to foodborne illness and 86 (90% CrI: 70\u2013105) deaths due to foodborne illness circa 2010. This study concludes that these rates are similar to recent estimates in the US and Canada.\n\nA main aim of this study was to compare if foodborne illness incidence had increased over time. In this study, similar methods of assessment were applied to data from circa 2000, which showed that the rate of foodborne gastroenteritis had not changed significantly over time. Two key estimates were the total number of gastroenteritis episodes each year, and the proportion considered foodborne. In circa 2010, it was estimated that 25% of all episodes of gastroenteritis were foodborne. By applying this proportion of episodes due to food to the incidence of gastroenteritis circa 2000, there were an estimated 4.3 million (90% CrI: 2.2\u20137.3 million) episodes of foodborne gastroenteritis circa 2000, although credible intervals overlap with 2010. Taking into account changes in population size, applying these equivalent methods suggests a 17% decrease in the rate of foodborne gastroenteritis between 2000 and 2010, with considerable overlap of the 90% credible intervals.\n\nThis study replaces a previous estimate of 5.4 million cases of food-borne illness in Australia every year, causing:<ref>\n{{cite web | url=http://www.ozfoodnet.gov.au/internet/ozfoodnet/publishing.nsf/Content/reports-1/$FILE/foodborne_report.pdf | title=Food borne illness in Australia | publisher=OzFoodNet}}\n</ref>\n* 18,000 hospitalizations\n* 120 deaths (0.5 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants)\n* 2.1 million lost days off work\n* 1.2 million doctor consultations\n* 300,000 prescriptions for antibiotics.\n\nMost foodborne disease outbreaks in Australia have been linked to raw or minimally cooked eggs or poultry.<ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Astridge K, McPherson M, Kirk M |title=Foodborne disease outbreaks in Australia 2001-2009|journal=Food Australia|date=2011|volume=63 |issue=12|pages=44\u201350|display-authors=etal}}</ref> The [[Australian Food Safety Information Council]] estimates that one third of cases of food poisoning occur in the home<ref>{{cite web|title=Food Hygiene|url=https://www.bupa.com.au/health-and-wellness/health-information/healthy-living/nutrition/eating/doc/food-hygiene|website=BUPA|access-date=13 September 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151211131645/https://www.bupa.com.au/health-and-wellness/health-information/healthy-living/nutrition/eating/doc/food-hygiene|archive-date=December 11, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Comparison between countries===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" \n!

The origin of most sporadic cases is undetermined. In the United States, where people eat outside the home frequently, 58% of cases originate from commercial food facilities (2004 FoodNet data). An outbreak is defined as occurring when two or more people experience similar illness after consuming food from a common source.\n\nOften, a combination of events contributes to an outbreak, for example, food might be left at room temperature for many hours, allowing bacteria to [[multiplication|multiply]] which is compounded by inadequate cooking which results in a failure to kill the dangerously elevated bacterial levels.\n\nOutbreaks are usually identified when those affected know each other. However, more and more, outbreaks are identified by [[public health]] staff from unexpected increases in laboratory results for certain strains of bacteria. Outbreak detection and investigation in the United States is primarily handled by local health jurisdictions and is inconsistent from district to district. It is estimated that 1\u20132% of outbreaks are detected.\n\n==Society and culture==\n\n===United Kingdom===\n\nIn postwar Aberdeen (1964) a large-scale (>400 cases) outbreak of [[typhoid]] occurred, caused by contaminated [[corned beef]] which had been imported from [[Argentina]].<ref>\nSmith, David F.; Diack, H. Lesley and Pennington, T. Hugh (2005) ''Food Poisoning, Policy and Politics : Corned Beef and Typhoid in Britain in the 1960s''. Boydell Press. {{ISBN|1-84383-138-4}}{{page needed|date=November 2013}}\n</ref> The corned beef was placed in cans and because the cooling plant had failed, cold river water from the [[R\u00edo de la Plata|Plate estuary]] was used to cool the cans. One of the cans had a defect and the meat inside was contaminated. This meat was then sliced using a meat slicer in a shop in Aberdeen, and a lack of cleaning the machinery led to spreading the contamination to other meats cut in the slicer. These meats were then eaten by the people of Aberdeen who then became ill.\n\nSerious outbreaks of foodborne illness since the 1970s prompted key changes in UK [[food safety]] law. These included the death of 19 patients in the Stanley Royd Hospital outbreak<ref>{{cite web|url=http://briandeer.com/social/stanley-royd.htm|title=Food poison deaths probe may reveal NHS flaws|date=February 24, 1985|author=Brian Deer|work=The Sunday Times}}</ref> and the [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (BSE, mad cow disease) outbreak identified in the 1980s.

Experts cite increased handling of food by humans as a major contributor, leading to outbreaks of parasites such as ''E. coli'' and cyclospora which can only come from human fecal matter.\n\n===Organizations===\n\nThe [[World Health Organization]] Department of Food Safety and Zoonoses (FOS) provides scientific advice for organizations and the public on issues concerning the safety of food. Its mission is to lower the burden of foodborne disease, thereby strengthening the health security and sustainable development of Member States. Foodborne and waterborne diarrhoeal diseases kill an estimated 2.2 million people annually, most of whom are children. WHO works closely with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) to address food safety issues along the entire food production chain\u2014from production to consumption\u2014using new methods of risk analysis. These methods provide efficient, science-based tools to improve food safety, thereby benefiting both public health and economic development.\n\n===International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN)===\n\nThe International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) is a joint program of the WHO and FAO. INFOSAN has been connecting national authorities from around the globe since 2004, with the goal of preventing the international spread of contaminated food and foodborne disease and strengthening food safety systems globally. This is done by:\n\n# Promoting the rapid exchange of information during food safety events;\n# Sharing information on important food safety issues of global interest;\n# Promoting partnership and collaboration between countries; and\n# Helping countries strengthen their capacity to manage food safety risks.\n\nMembership to INFOSAN is voluntary, but is restricted to representatives from national and regional government authorities and requires an official letter of designation. INFOSAN seeks to reflect the multidisciplinary nature of food safety and promote intersectoral collaboration by requesting the designation of Focal Points in each of the respective national authorities with a stake in food safety, and a single Emergency Contact Point in the national authority with the responsibility for coordinating national food safety emergencies; countries choosing to be members of INFOSAN are committed to sharing information between their respective food safety authorities and other INFOSAN members.

While delivering a routine message to the Gulab Singh, Zorawar told him of the financial waste occurring in the fort administration and boldly presented his own scheme to effect savings. Gulab Singh was impressed by Zorawar's sincerity and appointed him commandant of [[Reasi]].\n\nZorawar Singh fulfilled his task and his grateful ruler made him commissariat officer of all forts north of Jammu.

In 1835 the nearby region of [[Paddar]] was taken from [[Chamba, Himachal Pradesh|Chamba]] (now in Himachal Pradesh) in the course of a battle.  Paddar later became known for its [[sapphire]] [[Mining|mines]].

Several petty principalities in this region were tributary to the Gyalpo (King) of Ladakh.  In 1834 one of these, the Raja of Timbus, sought Zorawar's help against the Gyalpo. Meanwhile, the Rajput general had been burning to distinguish himself by expanding the territory of Raja [[Gulab Singh]] \u2014 also at that time, according to the Gulabnama, Kishtwar went through a drought that caused a loss of revenue and forced Zorawar to extract money through war.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Art of Generalship|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uAmqCQAAQBAJ|publisher = Vij Books India Pvt Ltd|date = 2015-05-07|isbn = 9789382652939|first = K.

The astute general doubled back to Kartse, where he sheltered his troops through the winter. In the spring of 1835 he defeated the large Ladakhi army of Banko Kahlon and marched his victorious troops towards [[Leh]]. The Gyalpo now agreed to pay 50,000 rupees as war-indemnity and 20,000 rupees as an annual tribute.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAlarmed at the gains of the [[Dogra]]s, the governor of Kashmir, Mehan Singh, incited the Ladakhi chieftains to rebel but Zorawar quickly marched back to the Himalayan valleys and subdued the rebels, now forcing the Raja of Zanskar to also pay a separate tribute to Jammu. But in 1836 Mehan Singh, who was in correspondence with the Lahore durbar, this time instigated the Gyalpo to revolt \u2014 Zorawar force-marched his army in ten days to surprise the Ladakhis and forced them to submit. He now built a fort outside Leh and placed there a garrison of 300 men under Dalel Singh \u2014 the Gyalpo was deposed to an estate and a Ladakhi general, Ngorub Stanzin, was made King. But the latter did not prove to be loyal hence the Gyalpo was restored to his throne in 1838.\n'''\n\n==Baltistan campaign==\nTo the northwest of Ladakh, and to the north of Kashmir, lies the region of [[Baltistan]]. Muhammad Shah, the son of the ruler of [[Skardu]], Raja Ahmad Shah, fled to Leh and sought the aid of the Gyalpo and Zorawar against his father. But some of the Ladakhi nobles allowed Ahmad Shah to imprison his son and sought his aid in a general rebellion against the Dogras. After defeating the Ladakhi rebels Zorawar invaded Baltistan in the winter of 1839/40 (Petech, Kingdom of ladakh, p.&nbsp;144, Datta, Ladakh, p.&nbsp;122 etc. etc.), adding a large contingent of Ladakhis to his army.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Buddhist Western Himalaya: A politico-religious history|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=R4VuovXa5YUC|publisher = Indus Publishing|date = 2001|isbn = 9788173871245|page = 194}}</ref>\n\nThe advance brigade of 5,000 under Nidhan Singh lost its way in the cold and snow and was surrounded by the enemy; many soldiers perished from the cold. Then Mehta Basti Ram, a prominent Rajput from Kishtwar, established contact with the main force. On their arrival the [[Botis]] of Skardu were defeated and forced to flee. They were chased to the fort of Skardu which was invested by Zorawar for a few days. One night the Dogras scaled the steep mountain behind the fort and after some fighting captured the small fort on its crest. From this position the next day they began firing down at the main fort and forced the Raja to surrender. Zorawar built a fort on the banks of the Indus where he placed a contingent of his soldiers.\n\nAfter placing Muhammad Shah on the throne for an annual tribute of 7000 rupees, a Dogra contingent under Wazir Lakhpat advanced westwards, conquered the fort of Astor and took its Darad Raja prisoner. However this Raja was tributary to Mehan Singh, the governor of Kashmir, who was alarmed at the Dogra conquests since they only expanded the kingdom of Gulab Singh while not bringing any benefit to the Lahore durbar. His complaint at [[Lahore]] was forwarded to Raja Gulab Singh at Jammu and he ordered the Darad Raja to be released.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title = General Zorawar Singh|url = https://archive.org/details/generalzorawarsi00char|publisher = Publications Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India|date = 1983|first = Sukh Dev Singh|last = Charak}}</ref>\n\n==Tibet expedition==\n{{Main|Sino-Sikh war}}\nZorawar Singh turned his energies eastward, towards [[Tibet]].

Another column of 300 men, under Ghulam Khan, marched along the mountains leading up to the [[Kailas Range]] and thus south of the Indus. Zorawar himself led 3,000 men along the plateau region where the vast and picturesque [[Pangong Tso|Pangong Lake]] is located. Sweeping all resistance before them, the three columns passed the [[Lake Manasarovar]] and converged at [[Gartok]], defeating the small Tibetan force stationed there. The enemy commander fled to [[Taklakot]] but Zorawar stormed that fort on 6 September 1841.

Others starved to death, while some burnt the wooden stock of their muskets to warm themselves. The Tibetans and their [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] allies regrouped and advanced to give battle, bypassing the Dogra fort of Chi-T\u2019ang.

Zorawar Singh was employed by the ambitious Raja [[Gulab Singh]] of [[Jammu]] and was placed under the commandant of the [[Reasi]] fort ([[Bhimgarh fort]]).  While delivering a routine message to the Gulab Singh, Zorawar told him of the financial waste occurring in the fort administration and boldly presented his own scheme to effect savings. Gulab Singh was impressed by Zorawar's sincerity and appointed him commandant of [[Reasi]].\n\nZorawar Singh fulfilled his task and his grateful ruler made him commissariat officer of all forts north of Jammu. He was later made governor of Kishtwar and was given the title of ''Wazir'' (minister).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = Lad\u00e1k, physical, statistical, and historical with notices of the surrounding countries|url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=s-VAAAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Suru+River++army+Botis+zorawar+5000&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAWoVChMIyejgydHUyAIVwV0aCh2VNgpr#v=snippet&q=5000&f=false|publisher = Allen|date = 1854|first = Alexander|last = Cunningham|pages = 10\u201319, 333\u2013340, 349\u2013354}}</ref>\n\nEven though it was a newly conquered region Zorawar had no trouble in keeping the peace; many of the local Rajputs were recruited into his army. In 1835 the nearby region of [[Paddar]] was taken from [[Chamba, Himachal Pradesh|Chamba]] (now in Himachal Pradesh) in the course of a battle.  Paddar later became known for its [[sapphire]] [[Mining|mines]]. But this was a mere sideshow to General Zorawar Singh's more famous expeditions, on which he had already embarked in the previous year.\n\n==The Ladakh campaigns==\n[[File:Zorawerfort.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Zorawar fort in Ladakh]]\nTo the east of Kishtwar and Kashmir are the snow-clad mountains of the upper [[Himalayas]] \u2014 the rivers of [[Zanskar Gorge]], [[Suru River (Indus)|Suru River]], and [[Dras River|Drass]] rise from these snows, and flow across the plateau of [[Ladakh]] into the Indus River. Several petty principalities in this region were tributary to the Gyalpo (King) of Ladakh.  In 1834 one of these, the Raja of Timbus, sought Zorawar's help against the Gyalpo. Meanwhile, the Rajput general had been burning to distinguish himself by expanding the territory of Raja [[Gulab Singh]] \u2014 also at that time, according to the Gulabnama, Kishtwar went through a drought that caused a loss of revenue and forced Zorawar to extract money through war.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Art of Generalship|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uAmqCQAAQBAJ|publisher = Vij Books India Pvt Ltd|date = 2015-05-07|isbn = 9789382652939|first = K.

The astute general doubled back to Kartse, where he sheltered his troops through the winter. In the spring of 1835 he defeated the large Ladakhi army of Banko Kahlon and marched his victorious troops towards [[Leh]]. The Gyalpo now agreed to pay 50,000 rupees as war-indemnity and 20,000 rupees as an annual tribute.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAlarmed at the gains of the [[Dogra]]s, the governor of Kashmir, Mehan Singh, incited the Ladakhi chieftains to rebel but Zorawar quickly marched back to the Himalayan valleys and subdued the rebels, now forcing the Raja of Zanskar to also pay a separate tribute to Jammu. But in 1836 Mehan Singh, who was in correspondence with the Lahore durbar, this time instigated the Gyalpo to revolt \u2014 Zorawar force-marched his army in ten days to surprise the Ladakhis and forced them to submit. He now built a fort outside Leh and placed there a garrison of 300 men under Dalel Singh \u2014 the Gyalpo was deposed to an estate and a Ladakhi general, Ngorub Stanzin, was made King. But the latter did not prove to be loyal hence the Gyalpo was restored to his throne in 1838.\n'''\n\n==Baltistan campaign==\nTo the northwest of Ladakh, and to the north of Kashmir, lies the region of [[Baltistan]]. Muhammad Shah, the son of the ruler of [[Skardu]], Raja Ahmad Shah, fled to Leh and sought the aid of the Gyalpo and Zorawar against his father. But some of the Ladakhi nobles allowed Ahmad Shah to imprison his son and sought his aid in a general rebellion against the Dogras. After defeating the Ladakhi rebels Zorawar invaded Baltistan in the winter of 1839/40 (Petech, Kingdom of ladakh, p.&nbsp;144, Datta, Ladakh, p.&nbsp;122 etc. etc.), adding a large contingent of Ladakhis to his army.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Buddhist Western Himalaya: A politico-religious history|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=R4VuovXa5YUC|publisher = Indus Publishing|date = 2001|isbn = 9788173871245|page = 194}}</ref>\n\nThe advance brigade of 5,000 under Nidhan Singh lost its way in the cold and snow and was surrounded by the enemy; many soldiers perished from the cold. Then Mehta Basti Ram, a prominent Rajput from Kishtwar, established contact with the main force. On their arrival the [[Botis]] of Skardu were defeated and forced to flee. They were chased to the fort of Skardu which was invested by Zorawar for a few days. One night the Dogras scaled the steep mountain behind the fort and after some fighting captured the small fort on its crest. From this position the next day they began firing down at the main fort and forced the Raja to surrender. Zorawar built a fort on the banks of the Indus where he placed a contingent of his soldiers.\n\nAfter placing Muhammad Shah on the throne for an annual tribute of 7000 rupees, a Dogra contingent under Wazir Lakhpat advanced westwards, conquered the fort of Astor and took its Darad Raja prisoner. However this Raja was tributary to Mehan Singh, the governor of Kashmir, who was alarmed at the Dogra conquests since they only expanded the kingdom of Gulab Singh while not bringing any benefit to the Lahore durbar. His complaint at [[Lahore]] was forwarded to Raja Gulab Singh at Jammu and he ordered the Darad Raja to be released.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title = General Zorawar Singh|url = https://archive.org/details/generalzorawarsi00char|publisher = Publications Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India|date = 1983|first = Sukh Dev Singh|last = Charak}}</ref>\n\n==Tibet expedition==\n{{Main|Sino-Sikh war}}\nZorawar Singh turned his energies eastward, towards [[Tibet]].

Another column of 300 men, under Ghulam Khan, marched along the mountains leading up to the [[Kailas Range]] and thus south of the Indus. Zorawar himself led 3,000 men along the plateau region where the vast and picturesque [[Pangong Tso|Pangong Lake]] is located. Sweeping all resistance before them, the three columns passed the [[Lake Manasarovar]] and converged at [[Gartok]], defeating the small Tibetan force stationed there. The enemy commander fled to [[Taklakot]] but Zorawar stormed that fort on 6 September 1841. Envoys from Tibet now came to him as did agents of the Maharaja of [[Nepal]], whose kingdom was only fifteen miles from Taklakot.\n\nThe fall of Taklakot finds mention in the report of the Chinese Imperial Resident, Meng Pao, at [[Lhasa]]:<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=yKPdw2EkTwoC&pg=PA31&dq=On+my+arrival+at+Taklakot+a+force+of+only+about+1,000+local+troops+could+be+mustered,+which+was+divided+and+stationed+as+guards+at+different+posts&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sGWnUaPYIM_PrQe814HgCg&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=On%20my%20arrival%20at%20Taklakot%20a%20force%20of%20only%20about%201%2C000%20local%20troops%20could%20be%20mustered%2C%20which%20was%20divided%20and%20stationed%20as%20guards%20at%20different%20posts&f=false Perspectives on South Asian Security by  Shanthie Mariey D'Souza, Rajsthree Jetly]</ref> <blockquote>\"''On my arrival at Taklakot a force of only about 1,000 local troops could be mustered, which was divided and stationed as guards at different posts.

The supplies for the Dogra army over such a long distance failed despite Zorawar's meticulous preparations.\n\nAs the intense cold, coupled with the rain, snow and lightning continued for weeks upon weeks, many of the soldiers lost their fingers and toes to frostbite. Others starved to death, while some burnt the wooden stock of their muskets to warm themselves. The Tibetans and their [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] allies regrouped and advanced to give battle, bypassing the Dogra fort of Chi-T\u2019ang. Zorawar and his men met them at the Battle of To-yo on 12 December 1841\u2014-in the early exchange of fire the Rajput general was wounded in his right shoulder but he grabbed a sword in his left hand.

After making over 100 appearances for ''The Seals'', and winning the [[Conference League Cup]] in 2001, he would leave the club in early 2003. After 18-months with [[Leigh Genesis F.C.|Leigh RMI]] he would go on to play for a host of [[Non-League football|non-league]] clubs including [[Northwich Victoria F.C.|Northwich Victoria]], [[Stalybridge Celtic F.C.|Stalybridge Celtic]], and [[Southport F.C.|Southport]].\n\nLancaster moved to the United States in 2005, initially to coach at a high school, but would soon get to itch to play competitively again. After an unsuccessful trial with the [[Atlanta Silverbacks FC|Atlanta Silverbacks]], he would soon sign for [[USL Second Division]] club [[Wilmington Hammerheads FC|Wilmington Hammerheads]] in 2006. He impressed in his season with ''The Hammerheads'' and he would move up a division to sign for the Atlanta Silverbacks in 2007. He would have two successful seasons with Atlanta, including being runner-up in the [[USL First Division]] in his debut season, but the club went on hiatus in late 2008 so he was forced to move on.\n\n[[Scottish Football League First Division|Scottish First Division]] club [[Queen of the South F.C.|Queen of the South]] would be Lancaster's next destination, he spent six months with ''The Doonhamers'' before being released at the end of the season. He signed for Swedish club [[Ljungskile SK|Ljungskile]] in the summer of 2009, but his tenure was short with the [[Superettan]] side.\n\nIn 2010, Lancaster would try his hand in the United States again, signing for [[Fort Lauderdale Strikers (2006\u20132016)|Miami FC]] who would later change their name to the [[Fort Lauderdale Strikers (2006\u20132016)|Fort Lauderdale Strikers]] in 2011. He spent two years with ''The Strikers'', being runner-up in [[Soccer Bowl (2011\u20132017)|Soccer Bowl]], in what was his final appearance for the club. He returned to the Atlanta Silverbacks in 2012, who were now competing in the [[North American Soccer League]].

At his first Olympics in Sydney, Norris made a poor start, missing the final of the 400-metre individual medley.  However, he qualified for the final of the 200-metre butterfly, where he was considered an outsider. Norris attacked from the start, contesting the lead over the first 100-metre.

He fared even worse at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in Athens, failing to reach a single final.\n\nOn arrival back in Australia, Norris departed the AIS to return to Newcastle, and thereafter announced that he would be taking a year out of swimming in 2005.\n\nNorris has a YouTube channel with his family called \u201cThe Norris Nuts\u201d, which features him, his wife and his 6 children.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Commonwealth Games medallists in swimming (men)]]\n* [[List of Olympic medalists in swimming (men)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.justinnorrisswimacademy.com/ Justin Norris Swim Academy]\n<br>\n{{Footer Commonwealth Champions 200m Butterfly Men}}\n{{Footer Commonwealth Champions 200m Medley Men}}\n{{Footer Commonwealth Champions 400m Medley Men}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Norris, Justin}}\n[[Category:1980 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Olympic swimmers of Australia]]\n[[Category:Australian male swimmers]]\n[[Category:Male butterfly swimmers]]\n[[Category:Male medley swimmers]]\n[[Category:Swimmers at the 2000 Summer Olympics]]\n[[Category:Swimmers at the 2004 Summer Olympics]]\n[[Category:Olympic bronze medalists for Australia]]\n[[Category:Commonwealth Games gold medallists for Australia]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Newcastle, New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Olympic bronze medalists in swimming]]\n[[Category:World Aquatics Championships medalists in swimming]]\n[[Category:Australian Institute of Sport swimmers]]\n[[Category:Medalists at the FINA World Swimming Championships (25 m)]]\n[[Category:Medalists at the 2000 Summer Olympics]]\n[[Category:Commonwealth Games medallists in swimming]]\n[[Category:Swimmers at the 2002 Commonwealth Games]]\n", "name_user": "175.36.133.110", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Norris"}
