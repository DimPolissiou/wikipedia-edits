As a result, Ireland, in a report titled \"Policy Consideration for Renewable Electricity to 2010\", made the commitment to have 4% of its total energy consumption come from renewable energy resources by 2002 and 13.2% by 2010. The Department of Communications Marine and Natural Resources (DCMNR) founded the Renewable Energy Group (REG) which established the short term analysis group (STAG) to investigate a means of accomplishing this goal. To meet the 2010 target of 13.2%, 1,432&nbsp;MW of electricity will need to be generated from renewable resources with 1,100&nbsp;MW being generated from wind resources both onshore and offshore.\n\nThe PSO charge is in place so that money is given to companies for generating electricity from renewable sources and to help fund peat-burning stations, as neither are competitive enough without it.

These mechanisms have shifted from the initial use of competitive auctions in the late 1990\u2019s, to a [[Feed-in tariff|Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff]] (REFiT) from 2006 to 2015, and back to a new renewable energy auction scheme as of 2020. Ireland\u2019s initial use of competitive auction from 1996 failed to support the intended growth in wind development. Between 2006 and 2015, the government supported a REFiT, secured for 15 years. The 2020 REFiT reference price for large wind (>5MW) is \u20ac70.98 /MWh and for small wind (<5MW) is \u20ac73.47/MWh.

The wind farm is owned and built by [[GE Energy]] and was co-developed by [[Airtricity]] and GE Energy. The site has 7&nbsp;GE Energy 3.6&nbsp;MW turbines that generate a total of 25&nbsp;MW. The development of the site was originally divided into two phases with the first phase being the current installation of 7&nbsp;turbines. The second phase was a partnership between Airtricity and [[Acciona Energy]]. Acciona Energy had an option to buy the project after the facility is completed. The wind farm was planned to expand to 520&nbsp;MW of power. However, in 2007, Phase 2 was cancelled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airtricity.com/assets/Uploads2/Press-Releases/Offshore-support-press-release1.pdf |title=Airtricity Welcomes Support for Offshore Wind Farm Development |website=Airtricity.com |accessdate=2017-01-15}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the waters off the Atlantic coastline of Ireland have higher winds, sites along the eastern coastline such as Arklow were chosen because of the shallower waters, which are 20 m deep or less.\n\nThe National Offshore Wind Association of Ireland (NOW Ireland) announced in April 2010 that 60,000&nbsp;potential jobs could be created in the Irish marine, construction, engineering and service industries through the development of offshore wind energy in Irish and European waters.

At present it is common to apply and obtain a 10-year permission for a wind energy development. Section 42 of the above Act originally permitted a 5-year extension of the \"appropriate period\" provided that substantial works were carried out. This caused major problems as the term \"substantial works\" was not clearly defined which resulted in a large variety in interpretation of what constituted substantial works among the various planning authorities. This issue was rectified by the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 section 28 which inserted an additional paragraph allowing a once off extension not exceeding 5 years if \"there were considerations of a commercial, economic or technical nature beyond the control of the applicant which substantially militated against either the commencement of development or the carrying out of substantial works pursuant to the planning permission\"\n\nThe fourth issue regarding the generation of wind power is the Renewable Energy [[Feed-in Tariff]], or REFIT.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iwea.com/index.cfm/action/downloadFile/twFId/44 |format=PDF |title=Renewable Energy Feed in Tariff |website=Iwea.com |accessdate=2017-01-15}}</ref> The purpose of REFIT is to encourage development of renewable energy resources.

However, applications currently being processed for grid connections exceed the limit by almost 1,500&nbsp;MW for a total for nearly 3,000&nbsp;MW.

As a result, Ireland, in a report titled \"Policy Consideration for Renewable Electricity to 2010\", made the commitment to have 4% of its total energy consumption come from renewable energy resources by 2002 and 13.2% by 2010. The Department of Communications Marine and Natural Resources (DCMNR) founded the Renewable Energy Group (REG) which established the short term analysis group (STAG) to investigate a means of accomplishing this goal. To meet the 2010 target of 13.2%, 1,432&nbsp;MW of electricity will need to be generated from renewable resources with 1,100&nbsp;MW being generated from wind resources both onshore and offshore.\n\nThe PSO charge is in place so that money is given to companies for generating electricity from renewable sources and to help fund peat-burning stations, as neither are competitive enough without it.

These mechanisms have shifted from the initial use of competitive auctions in the late 1990\u2019s, to a [[Feed-in tariff|Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff]] (REFiT) from 2006 to 2015, and back to a new renewable energy auction scheme as of 2020.

The development of the site was originally divided into two phases with the first phase being the current installation of 7&nbsp;turbines. The second phase was a partnership between Airtricity and [[Acciona Energy]]. Acciona Energy had an option to buy the project after the facility is completed. The wind farm was planned to expand to 520&nbsp;MW of power.

At present it is common to apply and obtain a 10-year permission for a wind energy development. Section 42 of the above Act originally permitted a 5-year extension of the \"appropriate period\" provided that substantial works were carried out. This caused major problems as the term \"substantial works\" was not clearly defined which resulted in a large variety in interpretation of what constituted substantial works among the various planning authorities. This issue was rectified by the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 section 28 which inserted an additional paragraph allowing a once off extension not exceeding 5 years if \"there were considerations of a commercial, economic or technical nature beyond the control of the applicant which substantially militated against either the commencement of development or the carrying out of substantial works pursuant to the planning permission\"\n\nThe fourth issue regarding the generation of wind power is the Renewable Energy [[Feed-in Tariff]], or REFIT.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iwea.com/index.cfm/action/downloadFile/twFId/44 |format=PDF |title=Renewable Energy Feed in Tariff |website=Iwea.com |accessdate=2017-01-15}}</ref> The purpose of REFIT is to encourage development of renewable energy resources.

The president leads the [[executive branch]] of the [[Federal government of Brazil|federal government]] and is the [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Brazilian Armed Forces]]. The [[presidential system]] was established in 1889, upon the proclamation of the republic in a military coup d'\u00e9tat against [[Pedro II of Brazil|Emperor Pedro II]]. Since then, Brazil has had six [[Constitution of Brazil|constitutions]], three dictatorships, and three democratic periods. During the democratic periods, voting has always been [[compulsory voting|compulsory]]. The [[Constitution of Brazil]], along with several [[constitutional amendments]], establishes the requirements, powers, and responsibilities of the president, their term of office and the method of election.<ref>Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil, art. 15 and Chapter II</ref>\n\n[[Jair Bolsonaro]] is the 38th and current president.

The president is also the [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Military of Brazil|armed forces]].\n\nPresidents in Brazil have significant lawmaking powers, exercised either by proposing laws to the [[National Congress of Brazil|National Congress]] or by using {{lang|pt|Medidas Provis\u00f3rias}} ([[provisional measure]]s), an instrument with the force of law that the president can enact in cases of urgency and necessity except to make changes to some areas of law (provisional measures cannot be used to change criminal law or electoral law). A provisional measure comes into effect immediately, before Congress votes on it, and remains in force for up to 60 days unless Congress votes to rescind it. The 60-day period can be extended once, up to 120 days. If Congress, on the other hand, votes to approve the provisional measure, it becomes an actual law, with changes decided by the legislative branch. The provisional measure expires at the end of the 60-day period (or the 120-day, in the case of extension), or sooner, if rejected by one of the Houses of Congress.<ref>Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil, art. 62 as amended by constitutional amendment n. 32</ref>\n\nArticle 84 of the current Federal Constitution, determines that the president has the power to\n# appoint and dismiss

Requirements ===\nThe [[Constitution of Brazil]] requires that a president be a [[native-born citizen]] of Brazil, at least 35 years of age, a resident of Brazil, in full exercise of their electoral rights, a registered voter, and a member of a [[List of political parties in Brazil|political party]] ([[write-in]] or independent candidates are prohibited).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Constitution of the

Before that, presidents had been barred from immediate reelection for all of Brazil's republican history, with the single exception of the latter half of the [[Vargas Era]], from 1937 to 1945.

That title has been used by all the constitutions of Brazil since the proclamation of the Republic to refer to the head of the Executive Branch.\n\nHowever, from the proclamation of the Republic in 1889 until 1937 the country was officially styled ''Republic of the United States of Brazil'', and from 1937 to 1967 the country was styled simply ''The United States of Brazil'', and thus the full title of the presidents of the Republic from 1891 until 1967\u2014that is, from [[Deodoro da Fonseca]]'s inauguration as President (between 1889 and 1891 he served as Head of the Provisional Government) until the end of [[Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco|Humberto Castello Branco]]'s term in 1967\u2014was ''President of the Republic of the United States of Brazil''. On 15 March 1967, the country's official name was changed to ''Federative Republic of Brazil''. On that same date, [[Artur da Costa e Silva|Arthur da Costa e Silva]] was sworn in as President succeeding Castello Branco. Since Costa e Silva, therefore, all presidents of Brazil have borne the full title of ''President of the Federative Republic of Brazil''.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Deodoro da Fonseca (1889).jpg\nFile:Floriano Peixoto (1891).jpg\nFile:Prudentedemorais.jpg\nFile:Campos Sales.jpg\nFile:Rodrigues Alves 3.jpg\nFile:Afonso Pena.jpg\nFile:Nilo Pe\u00e7anha 02.jpg\nFile:Hermes da Fonseca (1910).jpg\nFile:Venceslau Br\u00e1s.jpg\nFile:Delfim Moreira (1918).jpg\nFile:Epitacio Pessoa (1919).jpg\nFile:Artur Bernardes (1922).jpg\nFile:Washington Lu\u00eds (foto).jpg\nFile:Cart\u00e3o-postal de Campanha de J\u00falio Prestes - 1930 (cropped).jpg\nFile:Isa\u00edas de Noronha 2, sem data.tif\nFile:Augusto Tasso Fragoso.jpg\nFile:Jo\u00e3o de Deus Menna Barreto, General, 1931.tif\nFile:Getulio Vargas (1930).jpg\nFile:Jos\u00e9 Linhares, presidente dos Estados Unidos do Brasil.tif|<center><small>15th</small></center><center><small>[[Jos\u00e9 Linhares]]</small></center><center><small>1945\u20131946</small></center>\nFile:GASPARDUTRA.jpg|<center><small>16th</small></center><center><small>[[Eurico Gaspar Dutra]]</small></center><center><small>1946\u20131951</small></center>\nFile:17 - Get\u00falio Dorneles Vargas 1951 derivative.jpg|<center><small>17th</small></center><center><small>[[Get\u00falio Vargas]]</small></center><center><small>1951\u20131954</small></center>\nFile:Caf\u00e9 Filho.jpg|<center><small>18th</small></center><center><small>[[Caf\u00e9 Filho]]</small></center><center><small>1954\u20131955</small></center>\nFile:CarlosLuz.jpg|<center><small>19th</small></center><center><small>[[Carlos Luz]]</small></center><center><small>1955</small></center>\nFile:Nereu.gif|<center><small>20th</small></center><center><small>[[Nereu Ramos]]</small></center><center><small>1955\u20131956</small></center>\nFile:Juscelino.jpg|<center><small>21st</small></center><center><small>[[Juscelino Kubitschek]]</small></center><center><small>1956\u20131961</small></center>\nFile:Janio Quadros.png|<center><small>22nd</small></center><center><small>[[J\u00e2nio Quadros]]</small></center><center><small>1961</small></center>\nFile:Ranieri Mazzilli (1961).jpg|<center><small>23rd</small></center><center><small>[[Ranieri Mazzilli]]</small></center><center><small>1961</small></center>\nFile:Jango.jpg|<center><small>24th</small></center><center><small>[[Jo\u00e3o Goulart]]</small></center><center><small>1961\u20131964</small></center>\nFile:Ranieri Mazzilli (1961).jpg|<center><small>25th</small></center><center><small>[[Ranieri Mazzilli]]</small></center><center><small>1964</small></center>\nFile:Castelobranco.jpg|<center><small>26th</small></center><center><small>[[Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco|Castelo Branco]]</small></center><center><small>1964\u20131967</small></center>\nFile:Costa e Silva.jpg|<center><small>27th</small></center><center><small>[[Artur da Costa e Silva]]</small></center><center><small>1967\u20131969</small></center>\nFile:Pedro Aleixo.jpg|<center><small>-</small></center><center><small>[[Pedro Aleixo]]</small></center><center><small>Never took office</small></center>\nFile:Brigadeiro M\u00e1rcio de Souza Mello, Ministro da Aeron\u00e1utica.tif|<center><small>-</small></center><center><small>[[M\u00e1rcio Melo]]</small></center><center><small>1969 (August 31-October 30)</small></center>\nFile:Aur\u00e9lio de Lira Tavares, General, Ministro do Ex\u00e9rcito..tif|<center><small>-</small></center><center><small>[[Aur\u00e9lio de Lira Tavares]]</small></center><center><small>1969 (August 31-October 30)</small></center>\nFile:Augusto Hamann Rademaker Gr\u00fcnewald, Vice-presidente da Rep\u00fablica..tif|<center><small>-</small></center><center><small>[[Augusto Rademaker]]</small></center><center><small>1969 (August 31-October 30)</small></center>\nFile:Em\u00edlio Garrastazu M\u00e9dici, presidente da Rep\u00fablica.

The character is based on the [[DC Comics]] character [[Green Arrow|of the same name]], created by [[Mort Weisinger]] and [[George Papp]] and was adapted for television in 2012 by [[Greg Berlanti]], [[Marc Guggenheim]] and [[Andrew Kreisberg]]. Oliver Queen has been continually portrayed by [[Stephen Amell]], with Jacob Hoppenbrouwer portraying a young Oliver.\n\nIn the series, Oliver, a billionaire playboy, who claimed to have spent five years shipwrecked on [[Lian Yu (Arrowverse location)|Lian Yu]], a mysterious island in the North China Sea, returns home to [[Starling City]] (later renamed \"Star City\") to fight crime and corruption as a secret [[vigilante]] whose weapon of choice is a bow and arrow. During the first season, Oliver focuses on a list, written by his father, of targets that are taking advantage of the citizens. Subsequent seasons have him venturing into all criminal activity, and he shifts from being willing to kill to having a rule against all killing as a means of stopping assailants. In ''Arrow'', Oliver is known during the first season as \"'''The Hood'''\", but drops that persona once he vows to stop killing and starts using a new name \"'''Arrow'''\". He does not take up the \"Green Arrow\" name until season four, when [[Roy Harper (Arrowverse)|Roy Harper]] publicly confessed to being the \"Arrow\" to protect Oliver. He is a friend and frequent ally of the [[Central City (Arrowverse)|Central City]]-based superhero [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|The Flash]], [[Sara Lance|White Canary]], the leader of the superhero team the Legends, and the [[Kryptonian]] superheroine [[Kara Danvers (Arrowverse)|Supergirl]] from the parallel universe of Earth-38.\n\nAmell has appeared as Oliver Queen and his vigilante persona in crossovers on the television series ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'', ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', and the animated web series ''[[Vixen (web series)|Vixen]]'', all set within the Arrowverse. The character has also appeared in several tie-in comics and novels, as well as appearing in two video games. Amell has received praise from critics for his portrayal Oliver Queen, and he has been nominated for various awards for his performance, including a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice]] and [[Leo Awards|Leo Award]].\n\n== Storyline ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2017}}\n\n=== ''Arrow'' ===\n==== Season 1 ====\n{{Further|Arrow (season 1)}}\n\nOliver Queen first appears in the pilot episode of ''Arrow''.<ref name=\"Pilot ep\" /> He is discovered on the deserted island of [[Lian Yu (Arrowverse location)|Lian Yu]] by fishermen that were sent there from Olivers friend in the Bratva, having been shipwrecked there five years earlier following the destruction of his family yacht the ''Queen's Gambit'', which he was on with his father [[Robert Queen (Arrowverse)|Robert Queen]] ([[Jamey Sheridan]]) and [[Sara Lance]] ([[Jacqueline MacInnes Wood]]), who did not survive. Oliver returns to [[Starling City]] and is greeted by his mother [[Moira Queen (Arrowverse)|Moira]] ([[Susanna Thompson]]), his sister [[Thea Queen|Thea]] ([[Willa Holland]]), his best friend [[Tommy Merlyn (Arrowverse)|Tommy Merlyn]] ([[Colin Donnell]]), and ex-girlfriend [[Laurel Lance (Arrowverse)|Laurel Lance]] ([[Katie Cassidy]]).

These sections are for real world content ONLY. This is not the place to discuss general plot info, but where analysis of plot, relationships, and characterization is given by REAL PEOPLE.!-->\n\nIn season one, Oliver is not afraid to kill criminals when he deems it necessary. Pilot episode director [[David Nutter]] believes that, following the time on the island, Oliver returns to Starling City with [[Posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) and this contributes to his willingness to kill. Amell stated,\"Killing people is gonna start to weigh on Oliver. He can't [complete his mission] by himself. He's gonna have to lean on somebody.\"<ref name=\"Zap2it\" /> Amell describes Oliver as having to battle himself in season one. Similarly identifying Oliver as having PTSD, Amell sees the character as a \"damaged individual\" who is a \"ticking time bomb\"; Oliver is not only doing good things, but falling along the way.<ref name=\"Collider Amell interview\" /> For Amell, the character's damaged nature will weigh on him throughout season one, because he must hide his new self from his family, and masquerade as the \"entitled jerk\" that he once was.<ref name=\"Collider Amell interview\" />\n\n=== Relationships ===\n<!--STOP! These sections are for real world content ONLY. This is not the place to discuss general plot info, but where analysis of plot, relationships, and characterization is given by REAL PEOPLE.!-->\nOriginally framed as a 'billionaire playboy',<ref name=\"Deadline Amell\" /> the character was involved in multiple romantic pairings over the course of the series first two seasons. However, from season three onwards his principal romantic relationship is with the character Felicity Smoak, who was originally slated to appear in one episode of season one, but went on to become a main character.<ref name=\"The Huffington Post Rickards\" /> The dynamic was developed between the pair in season two, with Stephen Amell stating \"she\u2019s the woman at the moment who knows me better than anybody\".<ref name=\"Den of Geek season 2\" /> Speaking to [[TV Line]] before the season three premiere, when asked whether or not \"there is a place on ''Arrow'' for a great love\", Amell stated \"I think that both Laurel and Sara, for Oliver, were loves that were principally from the past, from before the boat. And any other sort of brief relationship that he\u2019s had has been flawed. Felicity has clearly, over the course of two-plus seasons, grown into that love for him.\"<ref name=\"TVLine Amell interview\" /> Talking about the development of the relationship in 2018, he stated that \"in our show, it was Oliver and Felicity, and it was going to be them no matter what\".<ref name=\"Fanfest Amell\" /> Actress Emily Bett Rickards, who portrays Felicity, believes she and Oliver and are soul mates,<ref name=\"Entertainment Weekly Rickards\" /> a sentiment echoed by Amell.<ref name=\"Entertainment Tonight Olicity\" /> Showrunner and executive producer [[Wendy Mericle]] described the emotional journey Oliver goes through during the [[Crisis on Earth-X|2017 Arrowverse crossover]], in which he and Felicity marry, as one where he \"explores the question of true love\".<ref name=\"TV Guide 2017 crossover\" /> Talking about the relationship in the latter half of season seven, showrunner [[Beth Schwartz]] commented \"They're definitely on track. They're back to, in a sense, being normal between each other. There's no friction between the relationship. They have a lot of obstacles in their way, but they'll be a team. It won't separate them. ... They'll be a force to reckon with.\"<ref name=\"TV Guide Olicity\" />\n\nOliver also has connections with the other characters on the show. Amell sees the relationship between Oliver and his mother, upon his return from the island, as almost adversarial. To him, the Queen family has many skeletons in their closets, which helped them to amass their wealth, and his return is a threat to that way of life.<ref name=\"Collider Amell interview\" /> Oliver's relationship with his younger sister Thea changes once he returns from the island as well. Amell notes that Thea looks up to Oliver before he went missing, but it was an Oliver that was immature and a jerk. When he returns, Thea has taken over that role and Oliver has to recognize that his behaviors before impeded his ability to get through to Thea in season one.<ref name=\"Collider Amell interview\" />\n\n=== Costume ===\n[[File:Arrowmask.jpg|thumb|Oliver receives this [[domino mask]] in the season two episode \"[[Three Ghosts]]\".<ref name=\"Three Ghosts ep\" /> The producers wanted something that felt as though it could have been part of the costume from the beginning.]]\nThe realistic approach to the series included the costume design for Oliver's vigilante persona, created by [[Colleen Atwood]].<ref name=\"The Hollywood Reporter Pilot\" /> According to Amell, it was important for the suit to be functional, and the best way that he knew for that was if he could put the costume on by himself: \"If I can put it on by myself, I think that people will buy it. And that was our idea. That\u2019s our world.\"<ref name=\"IGN Amell interview\" />\n\nIn the second half of season two, Oliver replaces his \"painted\" mask with a [[domino mask]] gifted to him by Barry, similar to one worn by the character in the comics.<ref name=\"Three Ghosts ep\" /> The change is addressed on-screen, with Kreisberg saying, \"He doesn't just put on a mask. It's actually a big plot point in an episode, and there really is a story behind, not only the need for the mask but also who provides him with it.\"<ref name=\"Entertainment Weekly S2 mask\" /> On adding the mask now, Kreisberg stated that, \"Conceptually, it was something we wanted to do because Oliver himself is evolving as the Arrow\u2014from vigilante to hero, sort of from Arrow to Green Arrow\u2014and we wanted to see that progression in his costume as well. As Oliver is embracing being a hero, being a hero means stepping out of the dark and being more of a symbol, so he has to take steps to conceal his identity more.\"<ref name=\"Entertainment Weekly S2 mask\" /> He added that it will \"allow the Arrow to interact with people who don't know his identity in a much more organic way than having him constantly keep his head down.\"<ref name=\"Entertainment Weekly S2 mask\" /> Costume designer Maya Mani put together roughly 50 mask options for the producers. Various designs reminded the creative team of something [[Joel Schumacher]] would create. Kreisberg said, \"What's so wonderful about the design that Maya came up with is that it really is very simple, and it feels as if it\u2019s been part of his costume since the beginning...once we finally had this mask and put it on Stephen [Amell], even Stephen was like, 'This is the right one.{{' \"}}<ref name=\"Entertainment Weekly S2 mask\" />\n\nIn season four, Oliver acquires a new costume. Designed by Mani at the end of season three, the costume originally had full sleeves. After input from producer Greg Berlanti and Amell, Mani redesigned the costume to show off the character's biceps, and be more reflective of the comic book counterpart. According to Mani, \"I wanted it to be tactical, so the shoulders are a little tougher [...] I also wanted him to be able to remove a layer or be in the layer and still be the Arrow, but not have the full fig on.\"<ref name=\"Fashionista Arrow custom\" />\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Critical response ===\n[[Andy Greenwald]] of ''[[Grantland]]'' wrote that Amell deserves a \"great deal of the credit\" for ''Arrow''{{'}}s success, as he brings a subtle humor hidden beneath his \"Hollister veneer\". Greenwald goes on to state that Amell's performance as Oliver Queen makes that persona a more interesting character than the Arrow.<ref name=\"Grantland Amell Arrow\" /> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s [[Ken Tucker]] acknowledged Amell's range as an actor for the series premiere: \"Amell is no mere muscle-head as an actor&nbsp;\u2014 he let confusion, dismay, disappointment, and resolve play across his face at the right moments, even when the dialogue became stilted or clunky.\"<ref name=\"Entertainment Weekly Amell Arrow\" /> [[Neil Genzlinger]] wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that Amell was \"just inscrutable enough to pull off the transition from the playboy he was before the shipwreck to the avenging, bow-wielding Green Arrow he becomes on his return to civilization\".<ref name=\"The New York Times Amell Arrow\" /> The ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''{{'}}s [[David Wiegand]] came to a similar conclusion, stating Amell has the \"acting skill that enables him to be convincing both as rescued rich kid Oliver Queen and as his green-hooded alter ego, Arrow\".<ref name=\"San Francisco Chronicle Amell Arrow\" /> In contrast, ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s Stephen Kelly found Amell more \"uncomfortable and awkward\" in the role, which made it difficult to like his character as a \"traumatised badass\".<ref name=\"The Guardian Amell Arrow\" />\n\n=== Accolades ===\n{{Awards table|5}}\n|-\n!

The 2013 game ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' contains downloadable content that features an optional costume for Green Arrow based on Queen's appearance in the first season. Amell provides his voice and likeness to the costume.<ref name=\"Comic Book Resources Injustice game\" /> 2014's ''[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]'' features an ''Arrow'' downloadable content pack that includes Oliver Queen in his Arrow persona, as well as a bonus level set on Lian Yu in which Oliver trains with Slade and raids Fyers' camp to destroy a weapons stockpile. Amell also voiced the traditional Green Arrow in the game.<ref name=\"Game Informer Lego Batman 3\" /> The Arrow would once again appear as a downloadable character in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]''

Though Oliver died a second time as a result, his friends and allies continue to defend Earth-Prime in his memory.\n\nIn May 2015, Amell revealed he had discussions with DC Entertainment to portray the character on ''[[Constantine (TV series)|Constantine]]'', a show that was initially not depicted as existing in the shared universe created by The CW series, saying, \"The reason that I was going to guest star on ''Constantine'', at least the idea that we were throwing around was <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[John Constantine (Arrowverse)|Constantine]]'s] an expert when it comes to the [[Lazarus Pit]], which is now something that is a part of and will continue to be a part of ''Arrow''.\" Amell stated that, even though ''Constantine'' was not renewed for a second season on [[NBC]], a crossover \"was and is still on the table\".<ref name=\"IGN Constantine crossover\" /> In August 2015, it was confirmed that [[Matt Ryan (actor)|Matt Ryan]], who portrayed Constantine, would appear on ''Arrow'' in the fourth-season episode \"[[Haunted (Arrow)|Haunted]]\", per a \"one-time-only\" deal.<ref name=\"The Hollywood Reporter Constantine crossover\" /><ref name=\"TV Insider Constantine crossover\" /> This set the stage for Constantine to become part of the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' cast in the show's fourth season.\n\n=== Aliases ===\nOliver Queen had several aliases before being known as \"Green Arrow\". His first alias in Star City was \"The Hood\", first used in the first season's episode \"[[Lone Gunmen (Arrow)|Lone Gunmen]]\".<ref name=\"Alias: The Hood\" /> This alias is associated with his vigilante persona until \"[[Broken Dolls (Arrow)|Broken Dolls]]\" when [[Quentin Lance]] ([[Paul Blackthorne]]) starts using \"The Arrow\" as his new name.<ref name=\"Alias: The Arrow 1\" /><ref name=\"Alias: The Arrow 2\" /> When Oliver joins the League of Assassins, Ra's al Ghul gives him his League name of {{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0647\u0645}} ({{transl|ar|Al Sah-him}}).<ref name=\"Alias: Al Sah-him\" /><ref name=\"Bustle Alias: Al Sah-him\" /> His final and current alias is \"Green Arrow\" which he adopted when returning to Star City, since Roy Harper previously confessed to being \"The Arrow\" to protect him.<ref name=\"Alias: Green Arrow\" /><ref name=\"Tech Times Alias: Green Arrow\" /> While in Russia, though not used by him to identify himself, he was known by others as Luchnik<ref name=\"Alias: Luchnik\" /><ref name=\"Entertainment Weekly Alias: Luchnik\" /> and Kapiushon.<ref name=\"Alias: Kapiushon\" /> During his time in prison he was given the prison number of \"Inmate 4587\".<ref name=\"Alias: Inmate 4587\" />\nAfter his death and resurrection, he trained with Jim Corrigan in Purgatory and became a celestial being known as the Spectre, who would assist the Paragons in escaping the Vanishing Point and sacrifice himself to use his new powers to defeat the Anti-Monitor in combat at the Dawn of Time and create Earth-Prime, consolidating the CW superhero shows into one Earth. Oliver's spirit would later go on to reside in a transcendental plane of existence through which a resurrected Mar Novu reunited him with Felicity Smoak in the series finale.\n\n=== Alternate Earths ===\n==== Oliver Queen (Earth-2) ====\nIn the season 2 episode of ''The Flash'', \"[[Enter Zoom]]\", it is revealed through video footage from Earth-2 that the Oliver Queen of that Earth died when the ''Queen's Gambit'' sunk, and that his father, Robert Queen, survived and went on to become a vigilante known as 'The Hood'.<ref name=\"Enter Zoom ep\" /> In the first episode of the final season of ''Arrow'', [[Adrian Chase]] became Earth-2's version of the Arrow.\n\n==== Oliver Queen / Green Arrow (Earth-16) ====\nIn the season 1 episode of ''Legends of Tomorrow'', \"[[Star City 2046]]\", the Legends arrive in a future version of Star City in the year 2046,<ref name=\"Entertainment Weekly Star City 2046\" /> which is later revealed to be on Earth-16.<ref name=\"Crisis on Infinite Earths: Part One ep\" /> They meet an older Oliver Queen who fought Grant Wilson, Slade's son, who took the mantle of Deathstroke. Wilson defeated Oliver and severed his left arm, and eventually devastated the whole city. Oliver replaced his arm with a cybernetic arm and out of grief, vanished from the public and hid himself in his bunker.<ref name=\"Star City 2046 ep\" />\n\n==== Dark Arrow (Earth-X) ====\nDuring the Crisis on Earth-X crossover event, set on Earth-53, one of the main antagonist is revealed to be that Earth's Oliver Queen. Known as {{strong|Dark Arrow}}, the character is [[Adolf Hitler]]'s successor as ''[[F\u00fchrer]]'', in a world where the Nazis won World War II, and have achieved world domination. He is married to [[Overgirl (Arrowverse)|Overgirl]] ([[Melissa Benoist]]), the Earth-X version of Kara Zor-El.<ref name=\"Crisis on Earth-X, Part 1 ep\" /> Another archer from Earth-X named [[Black Arrow (Arrowverse)|Black Arrow]], voiced by [[Matthew Mercer]], appears in the animated web series ''[[Freedom Fighters: The Ray]]''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n=== Tie-in comics and novels ===\nThe ''Arrow'' version of Oliver Queen first appeared in the 2012 prequel comic \"Arrow #1: Special Edition\".<ref name=\"Arrow #1\" /> The comic was released before the series aired<ref name=\"Arrow comic series announcement\" /> and it ties in with the TV series' first season. The comic was later developed into an ongoing digital comic series titled ''[[Arrow (2012 comic book)|Arrow]]'',<ref name=\"Arrow comic series announcement\" /><ref name=\"Arrow vol 1\" /> that lasted 36 chapters between 2012\u201313 and featured various storylines.<ref name=\"Arrow #36\" /> The next year, the character appeared in ''[[Arrow: Season 2.5]]'', a bi-weekly comic series which bridged the gap between the end of season two and the start of season three.<ref name=\"TV Guide Arrow: Season 2.5\" />\n\nIn 2015, Oliver appeared in tie-in novel, ''[[Arrow: Vengeance]]'', written by [[Oscar Balderrama]] and Lauren Certo.<ref name=\"Arrow: Vengeance\" /> In 2016 he appeared in the crossover novel ''[[The Flash: The Haunting of Barry Allen]]'' written by Susan and Clay Griffith,<ref name=\"The Flash: The Haunting of Barry Allen\" /> and in 2017 in the conclusion of the crossover, ''[[Arrow: A Generation of Vipers]]'', by the same authors.<ref name=\"Arrow: A Generation of Vipers\" /> In 2018 Oliver appeared in the tie-in novel ''[[Arrow: Fatal Legacies]]'', co-authored by [[Marc Guggenheim]] and James R. Tuck, published in January 2018, which bridged the gap between the season five finale and the season six premiere.<ref name=\"Bleeding Cool Arrow: Fatal Legacies\" />\n\n== Portrayal ==\nAmell was cast as Queen in January 2012,<ref name=\"Deadline casting\" /> and was the first actor to audition for the role, with Kreisberg saying that Amell \"hit the target from the outset\" and \"everyone else just paled in comparison\".<ref name=\"Canada\" /> Producer Marc Guggenheim expressed that the creative team wanted to \"chart [their] own course, [their] own destiny\", and avoid any direct connections to ''[[Smallville]]'', which featured its own [[Oliver Queen (Smallville)|Oliver Queen / Green Arrow]] ([[Justin Hartley]]), opting to cast a new actor in the role.<ref name=\"Canada\" /> It was also the first script that Amell auditioned for during [[Television pilot|pilot season]], having received multiple scripts at the start of the year.<ref name=\"Collider Amell interview\" /> For Amell, the appeal of portraying Queen was that he saw multiple roles tied to the same character: \"There\u2019s Queen the casual playboy; Queen the wounded hero; Queen the brooding Hamlet; Queen the lover; Queen the man of action, and so on.\"<ref name=\"Canada\" /> The actor, who was already in shape from ''[[Rent-a-Goalie]]'', did physical fitness training at Tempest Freerunning Academy out of [[Reseda, Los Angeles]], California. Amell received archery training as well, which included watching a video on how archery has been displayed inaccurately or poorly in television and film before learning the basics of shooting a bow.<ref name=\"Canada\" /> Amell describes the up-keep on his fitness as the biggest physical challenge of the series. Amell stated that he has to \"steal time at the gym\", and spends time on set being active.<ref name=\"Collider Amell interview\" />\n\n== Character development ==\n\n=== Characterization ===\n<!--STOP! These sections are for real world content ONLY. This is not the place to discuss general plot info, but where analysis of plot, relationships, and characterization is given by REAL PEOPLE.!-->\n\nIn season one, Oliver is not afraid to kill criminals when he deems it necessary. Pilot episode director [[David Nutter]] believes that, following the time on the island, Oliver returns to Starling City with [[Posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) and this contributes to his willingness to kill. Amell stated,\"Killing people is gonna start to weigh on Oliver. He can't [complete his mission] by himself. He's gonna have to lean on somebody.\"<ref name=\"Zap2it\" /> Amell describes Oliver as having to battle himself in season one. Similarly identifying Oliver as having PTSD, Amell sees the character as a \"damaged individual\" who is a \"ticking time bomb\"; Oliver is not only doing good things, but falling along the way.<ref name=\"Collider Amell interview\" /> For Amell, the character's damaged nature will weigh on him throughout season one, because he must hide his new self from his family, and masquerade as the \"entitled jerk\" that he once was.<ref name=\"Collider Amell interview\" />\n\n=== Relationships ===\n<!--STOP! These sections are for real world content ONLY. This is not the place to discuss general plot info, but where analysis of plot, relationships, and characterization is given by REAL PEOPLE.!-->\nOriginally framed as a 'billionaire playboy',<ref name=\"Deadline Amell\" /> the character was involved in multiple romantic pairings over the course of the series first two seasons. However, from season three onwards his principal romantic relationship is with the character Felicity Smoak, who was originally slated to appear in one episode of season one, but went on to become a main character.<ref name=\"The Huffington Post Rickards\" /> The dynamic was developed between the pair in season two, with Stephen Amell stating \"she\u2019s the woman at the moment who knows me better than anybody\".<ref name=\"Den of Geek season 2\" /> Speaking to [[TV Line]] before the season three premiere, when asked whether or not \"there is a place on ''Arrow'' for a great love\", Amell stated \"I think that both Laurel and Sara, for Oliver, were loves that were principally from the past, from before the boat. And any other sort of brief relationship that he\u2019s had has been flawed. Felicity has clearly, over the course of two-plus seasons, grown into that love for him.\"<ref name=\"TVLine Amell interview\" /> Talking about the development of the relationship in 2018, he stated that \"in our show, it was Oliver and Felicity, and it was going to be them no matter what\".<ref name=\"Fanfest Amell\" /> Actress Emily Bett Rickards, who portrays Felicity, believes she and Oliver and are soul mates,<ref name=\"Entertainment Weekly Rickards\" /> a sentiment echoed by Amell.<ref name=\"Entertainment Tonight Olicity\" /> Showrunner and executive producer [[Wendy Mericle]] described the emotional journey Oliver goes through during the [[Crisis on Earth-X|2017 Arrowverse crossover]], in which he and Felicity marry, as one where he \"explores the question of true love\".<ref name=\"TV Guide 2017 crossover\" /> Talking about the relationship in the latter half of season seven, showrunner [[Beth Schwartz]] commented \"They're definitely on track. They're back to, in a sense, being normal between each other. There's no friction between the relationship. They have a lot of obstacles in their way, but they'll be a team. It won't separate them. ... They'll be a force to reckon with.\"<ref name=\"TV Guide Olicity\" />\n\nOliver also has connections with the other characters on the show. Amell sees the relationship between Oliver and his mother, upon his return from the island, as almost adversarial. To him, the Queen family has many skeletons in their closets, which helped them to amass their wealth, and his return is a threat to that way of life.<ref name=\"Collider Amell interview\" /> Oliver's relationship with his younger sister Thea changes once he returns from the island as well. Amell notes that Thea looks up to Oliver before he went missing, but it was an Oliver that was immature and a jerk. When he returns, Thea has taken over that role and Oliver has to recognize that his behaviors before impeded his ability to get through to Thea in season one.<ref name=\"Collider Amell interview\" />\n\n=== Costume ===\n[[File:Arrowmask.jpg|thumb|Oliver receives this [[domino mask]] in the season two episode \"[[Three Ghosts]]\".<ref name=\"Three Ghosts ep\" /> The producers wanted something that felt as though it could have been part of the costume from the beginning.]]\nThe realistic approach to the series included the costume design for Oliver's vigilante persona, created by [[Colleen Atwood]].<ref name=\"The Hollywood Reporter Pilot\" /> According to Amell, it was important for the suit to be functional, and the best way that he knew for that was if he could put the costume on by himself: \"If I can put it on by myself, I think that people will buy it. And that was our idea. That\u2019s our world.\"<ref name=\"IGN Amell interview\" />\n\nIn the second half of season two, Oliver replaces his \"painted\" mask with a [[domino mask]] gifted to him by Barry, similar to one worn by the character in the comics.<ref name=\"Three Ghosts ep\" /> The change is addressed on-screen, with Kreisberg saying, \"He doesn't just put on a mask. It's actually a big plot point in an episode, and there really is a story behind, not only the need for the mask but also who provides him with it.\"<ref name=\"Entertainment Weekly S2 mask\" /> On adding the mask now, Kreisberg stated that, \"Conceptually, it was something we wanted to do because Oliver himself is evolving as the Arrow\u2014from vigilante to hero, sort of from Arrow to Green Arrow\u2014and we wanted to see that progression in his costume as well. As Oliver is embracing being a hero, being a hero means stepping out of the dark and being more of a symbol, so he has to take steps to conceal his identity more.\"<ref name=\"Entertainment Weekly S2 mask\" /> He added that it will \"allow the Arrow to interact with people who don't know his identity in a much more organic way than having him constantly keep his head down.\"<ref name=\"Entertainment Weekly S2 mask\" /> Costume designer Maya Mani put together roughly 50 mask options for the producers. Various designs reminded the creative team of something [[Joel Schumacher]] would create. Kreisberg said, \"What's so wonderful about the design that Maya came up with is that it really is very simple, and it feels as if it\u2019s been part of his costume since the beginning...once we finally had this mask and put it on Stephen [Amell], even Stephen was like, 'This is the right one.{{' \"}}<ref name=\"Entertainment Weekly S2 mask\" />\n\nIn season four, Oliver acquires a new costume. Designed by Mani at the end of season three, the costume originally had full sleeves. After input from producer Greg Berlanti and Amell, Mani redesigned the costume to show off the character's biceps, and be more reflective of the comic book counterpart. According to Mani, \"I wanted it to be tactical, so the shoulders are a little tougher [...] I also wanted him to be able to remove a layer or be in the layer and still be the Arrow, but not have the full fig on.\"<ref name=\"Fashionista Arrow custom\" />\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Critical response ===\n[[Andy Greenwald]] of ''[[Grantland]]'' wrote that Amell deserves a \"great deal of the credit\" for ''Arrow''{{'}}s success, as he brings a subtle humor hidden beneath his \"Hollister veneer\". Greenwald goes on to state that Amell's performance as Oliver Queen makes that persona a more interesting character than the Arrow.<ref name=\"Grantland Amell Arrow\" /> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s [[Ken Tucker]] acknowledged Amell's range as an actor for the series premiere: \"Amell is no mere muscle-head as an actor&nbsp;\u2014 he let confusion, dismay, disappointment, and resolve play across his face at the right moments, even when the dialogue became stilted or clunky.\"<ref name=\"Entertainment Weekly Amell Arrow\" /> [[Neil Genzlinger]] wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that Amell was \"just inscrutable enough to pull off the transition from the playboy he was before the shipwreck to the avenging, bow-wielding Green Arrow he becomes on his return to civilization\".<ref name=\"The New York Times Amell Arrow\" /> The ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''{{'}}s [[David Wiegand]] came to a similar conclusion, stating Amell has the \"acting skill that enables him to be convincing both as rescued rich kid Oliver Queen and as his green-hooded alter ego, Arrow\".<ref name=\"San Francisco Chronicle Amell Arrow\" /> In contrast, ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s Stephen Kelly found Amell more \"uncomfortable and awkward\" in the role, which made it difficult to like his character as a \"traumatised badass\".<ref name=\"The Guardian Amell Arrow\" />\n\n=== Accolades ===\n{{Awards table|5}}\n|-\n!

The son of [[Balian of Ibelin]] and [[Maria Comnena, Queen consort of Jerusalem]], he had close ties with the nobility of both [[Kingdom of Cyprus|Cyprus]] and [[Jerusalem]], since he was the half-brother of Queen [[Isabella I of Jerusalem]].  Before he was 20, he was appointed [[Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem|constable of Jerusalem]], and a few years later became lord of [[Beirut]], where he rebuilt the city after Saladin's conquest, and established the grand Ibelin family palace. He served as regent for two of his young relatives, Isabella's daughter [[Maria of Montferrat]] from 1205 to 1210, and then [[Henry I of Cyprus]] from 1228 until Henry came of age in 1232.  John was known as a principled man, and was seen as the natural leader of the Christian barons in the Holy Land. He resisted the power-seeking of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], in Cyprus, and opposed the imperial forces until Henry came of age.\n\n==Early years==\nHe was the son of [[Balian of Ibelin|Balian]], Lord of [[Nablus]] and [[Lordship of Ibelin|Ibelin]], and [[Maria Comnena, Queen consort of Jerusalem|Maria Comnena]], widow of [[Amalric I of Jerusalem]]. By 1198 he had become [[Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem|constable of Jerusalem]]; the fact that he was the half-brother of [[Isabella of Jerusalem|Isabella, Queen of Jerusalem]] gave him considerable influence. At the time he was a vassal of [[Ralph of Tiberias]], who was exiled from the kingdom after being accused of attempting to assassinate king [[Amalric II of Jerusalem|Amalric II]]. John attempted to mediate but Amalric would not back down.\n\n==Lord of Beirut==\nSometime before 1205 John relinquished the office of constable in exchange for the lordship of [[Beirut]], which became the home of the Ibelin family for the rest of the century. He rebuilt the city, which had been completely destroyed during [[Saladin]]'s conquest of the [[kingdom of Jerusalem|Jerusalem kingdom]]. He also constructed an opulent palace with art from both Muslim and Byzantine influences.  A German ambassador in 1212, Wilbrand of Oldenburg, wrote an impressive account of the castle, describing [[fresco]] paintings, mosaics on the floors, and a marble fountain in the courtyard.<ref>{{cite book|title=A History of the Crusades|author=Kenneth Setton|pages=142&ndash;143|year=1985|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-09144-6| quote=The Ibelin palace of Beirut, which took away the breath of a German ambassador to the east, shows Moslem and Byzantine influences.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Crusader Art in the Holy Land|author=Folda, Jaroslav|isbn=978-0-521-83583-1 |year=2005 | publisher=Cambridge University Press }}</ref> Historian Peter Edbury described the ambassador's account as \"A feature of the public rooms were the ''[[Trompe-l'oeil]]'' effects achieved with marble inlays, with a floor resembling the sea and a ceiling 'painted with such life-like colours that clouds pass across, the west wind blows, and there the sun seems to mark out the year and the months, the days and the weeks, the hours and the moments by its movement in the zodiac'. A marble fountain with a dragon as the centre-piece stood in the central hall, its jets cooling the air and the murmur of the water giving an altogether soothing effect.\" The castle was so well fortified, that in 1231\u20131232, it withstood a siege lasting several months.<ref name=edbury-29>Edbury, p. 29</ref>\n\nBeirut was effectively an independent state under John's rule; in 1207 John added [[Arsuf]] to his territory through his marriage to [[Melisende of Arsuf]], making him one of the wealthiest nobles in the kingdom.<ref name=edbury-29/>\n\n==Regent==\n\nFrom 1205 to 1210 John served as [[regent]] in [[Akko|Acre]], the new capital of the [[kingdom of Jerusalem#Disaster and recovery|Kingdom of Jerusalem]], for [[Maria of Montferrat]], Queen Isabella I's daughter. As regent, John helped arrange the marriage of Amalric II's son [[Hugh I of Cyprus]] to [[Alice of Cyprus|Alice of Champagne]], daughter of Amalric's predecessor as [[King of Jerusalem]], [[Henry II of Champagne]]. In 1210 he also helped arrange Maria of Montferrat's marriage to [[John of Brienne]], who was suggested by king [[Philip II of France]].\n\nBy 1217 John and his brother Philip of Ibelin had become involved in the politics of the [[Kingdom of Cyprus]] as well. They had apparently alienated themselves from John of Brienne, but the two represented Cyprus at a council in Acre, which met to plan for the arrival of the [[Fifth Crusade]].  When Hugh I died in 1218, Philip became regent for Hugh's son [[Henry I of Cyprus]], Philip's nephew.  When Philip died in 1228, John took over the same office.  Although both Philip and John were closely related to Henry I, as his uncles, they were still opposed on Cyprus by supporters of the [[Lusignan]] family, of which Henry was also a member; another of his uncles, [[Guy of Lusignan]], and father Amalric, were the first two kings of Cyprus.\n\n==Battle for Cyprus==\n{{see also|War of the Lombards}}\nIn 1228, the power struggle was amplified when [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] arrived in Cyprus on the [[Sixth Crusade]]. Frederick was connected to the Jerusalem nobles by being married to [[Yolande of Jerusalem|Isabella II]], John of Brienne's daughter, and Frederick attempted to use this to take power.  He claimed the kingship of Jerusalem and the overlordship of Cyprus, as well as John of Ibelin's lordship of Beirut, which John naturally refused. When lured to a banquet and then confronted with Frederick's armed guards, John was forced to hand over the regency, and Cyprus, to Emperor Frederick's control. However, this was temporary, as John later resisted with military force.  After Frederick departed from the island in April, John's forces defeated the remaining imperial bailiffs in a battle outside [[Nicosia]] on July 14, 1229, thus beginning the [[War of the Lombards]]. Frederick sent an army in 1231, under the marshal of the Empire, which attempted to invade Cyprus. John was able to repel the invasion at the [[Battle of Agridi]], but the imperial fleet sailed to John's power center of Beirut, which they besieged and almost captured. The imperial marshal, [[Richard Filangieri]], was able to establish himself in [[Jerusalem]] and [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], which he had regained by treaty in 1229, but not in Beirut or the capital in Acre.\n\nIn Acre, John's supporters formed a [[medieval commune|commune]], of which John himself was elected mayor when he arrived in 1232. The [[Commune of Acre]] was able to relieve the siege of Beirut, but in John's absence from Cyprus, the supporters of the Lusignans took control. In any case, the boy [[Henry I of Cyprus]] came of age in the same year, and John's regency was no longer necessary. When Henry I succeeded to the throne, both John and Riccardo immediately raced back to Cyprus, where the imperial forces were defeated in battle on June 15.  Henry became undisputed king of Cyprus, and since he supported the Ibelins over the Lusignans, John's family remained influential.\n\nConflict continued, as Filangieri remained in control of Jerusalem and Tyre, and had the support of [[Bohemund IV of Antioch]], the [[Teutonic Knights]], the [[Knights Hospitaller]], and the [[Pisa]]n merchants.  John, for his part, was supported by his nobles on Cyprus, and in his continental holdings in Beirut, [[Caesarea]], and [[Arsuf]], as well as by the [[Knights Templar]] and the [[Genoa|Genoese]] merchant community. Neither side could make any headway, and in 1234 [[Pope Gregory IX]] [[excommunicated]] John and his supporters. This was partly revoked in 1235, but still no peace could be made.\n\nIn the last year of his life, John of Ibelin, as did many other elderly barons, joined the order of the [[Knights Templar]], so that he could die as a Templar.  His family was opposed to this, but John insisted, and was honored with a grand funeral in [[Acre (city)|Acre]] in 1236.<ref>[[Malcolm Barber]], ''The New Knighthood''</ref>\n\n==Family==\nJohn was married twice.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1973|p=22}} His first wife, in 1201/1202, was Helvis of Nephin.

The son of [[Balian of Ibelin]] and [[Maria Comnena, Queen consort of Jerusalem]], he had close ties with the nobility of both [[Kingdom of Cyprus|Cyprus]] and [[Jerusalem]], since he was the half-brother of Queen [[Isabella I of Jerusalem]].  Before he was 20, he was appointed [[Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem|constable of Jerusalem]], and a few years later became lord of [[Beirut]], where he rebuilt the city after Saladin's conquest, and established the grand Ibelin family palace. He served as regent for two of his young relatives, Isabella's daughter [[Maria of Montferrat]] from 1205 to 1210, and then [[Henry I of Cyprus]] from 1228 until Henry came of age in 1232.  John was known as a principled man, and was seen as the natural leader of the Christian barons in the Holy Land. He resisted the power-seeking of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], in Cyprus, and opposed the imperial forces until Henry came of age.\n\n==Early years==\nHe was the son of [[Balian of Ibelin|Balian]], Lord of [[Nablus]] and [[Lordship of Ibelin|Ibelin]], and [[Maria Comnena, Queen consort of Jerusalem|Maria Comnena]], widow of [[Amalric I of Jerusalem]]. By 1198 he had become [[Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem|constable of Jerusalem]]; the fact that he was the half-brother of [[Isabella of Jerusalem|Isabella, Queen of Jerusalem]] gave him considerable influence. At the time he was a vassal of [[Ralph of Tiberias]], who was exiled from the kingdom after being accused of attempting to assassinate king [[Amalric II of Jerusalem|Amalric II]]. John attempted to mediate but Amalric would not back down.\n\n==Lord of Beirut==\nSometime before 1205 John relinquished the office of constable in exchange for the lordship of [[Beirut]], which became the home of the Ibelin family for the rest of the century. He rebuilt the city, which had been completely destroyed during [[Saladin]]'s conquest of the [[kingdom of Jerusalem|Jerusalem kingdom]]. He also constructed an opulent palace with art from both Muslim and Byzantine influences.  A German ambassador in 1212, Wilbrand of Oldenburg, wrote an impressive account of the castle, describing [[fresco]] paintings, mosaics on the floors, and a marble fountain in the courtyard.<ref>{{cite book|title=A History of the Crusades|author=Kenneth Setton|pages=142&ndash;143|year=1985|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-09144-6| quote=The Ibelin palace of Beirut, which took away the breath of a German ambassador to the east, shows Moslem and Byzantine influences.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Crusader Art in the Holy Land|author=Folda, Jaroslav|isbn=978-0-521-83583-1 |year=2005 | publisher=Cambridge University Press }}</ref> Historian Peter Edbury described the ambassador's account as \"A feature of the public rooms were the ''[[Trompe-l'oeil]]'' effects achieved with marble inlays, with a floor resembling the sea and a ceiling 'painted with such life-like colours that clouds pass across, the west wind blows, and there the sun seems to mark out the year and the months, the days and the weeks, the hours and the moments by its movement in the zodiac'. A marble fountain with a dragon as the centre-piece stood in the central hall, its jets cooling the air and the murmur of the water giving an altogether soothing effect.\" The castle was so well fortified, that in 1231\u20131232, it withstood a siege lasting several months.<ref name=edbury-29>Edbury, p. 29</ref>\n\nBeirut was effectively an independent state under John's rule; in 1207 John added [[Arsuf]] to his territory through his marriage to [[Melisende of Arsuf]], making him one of the wealthiest nobles in the kingdom.<ref name=edbury-29/>\n\n==Regent==\n\nFrom 1205 to 1210 John served as [[regent]] in [[Akko|Acre]], the new capital of the [[kingdom of Jerusalem#Disaster and recovery|Kingdom of Jerusalem]], for [[Maria of Montferrat]], Queen Isabella I's daughter. As regent, John helped arrange the marriage of Amalric II's son [[Hugh I of Cyprus]] to [[Alice of Cyprus|Alice of Champagne]], daughter of Amalric's predecessor as [[King of Jerusalem]], [[Henry II of Champagne]].

It is the seat of the [[Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie|Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie administrative region]] and the central city of the [[urban agglomeration of Longueuil]]. It sits on the [[South Shore (Montreal)|south shore]] of the [[Saint Lawrence River]] directly across from [[Montreal]]. The population as of the [[Canada 2016 Census]] totalled 239,700, making it Montreal's second largest suburb, the fifth most populous city in Quebec and [[List of the 100 largest municipalities in Canada by population|twentieth]] largest in Canada.\n\n[[Charles le Moyne de Longueuil et de Ch\u00e2teauguay|Charles Le Moyne]] founded Longueuil  as a ''[[Seigneurial system of New France|seigneurie]]'' in 1657. It would become a parish in 1845, a village in 1848, a town in 1874 and a city in 1920. Between 1961 and 2002, Longueuil's borders grew three times, as it was amalgamated with surrounding municipalities; there was a strong de-amalgamation in 2006 (see [[2000\u20132006 municipal reorganization in Quebec]]).\n\nLongueuil is a residential, commercial and industrial city. It incorporates some [[urban area|urban]] features, but is essentially a [[suburb]]. Longueuil can be classified as a [[commuter town]] as a large portion of its residents commute to work in Montreal. Most buildings are single-family homes constructed in the post-war period. The city consists of three boroughs: [[Le Vieux-Longueuil]], [[Saint-Hubert, Quebec|Saint-Hubert]] and [[Greenfield Park, Quebec|Greenfield Park]].\n\nLongueuil is the seat of the [[Judicial districts of Quebec|judicial district]] of Longueuil.<ref>[http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=2&file=/D_11/D11_A.HTM ''Territorial Division Act''].

Longueuil was founded in 1657 by [[Charles le Moyne de Longueuil et de Ch\u00e2teauguay|Charles Le Moyne]], a merchant from [[Fort Ville-Marie|Ville-Marie]] (present day Montreal), as a [[Seigneurial system of New France|seigneurie]].<ref name=\"CanadianEncyclopedia\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/longueuil|title=Longueuil|last=LINTEAU|first=PAUL-ANDR\u00c9|author2=CLAIRE POITRAS |work=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|publisher=[[Historica-Dominion Institute]]|accessdate=25 February 2012}}</ref> According to Abb\u00e9 Faillon, Charles Le Moyne, lord of the area starting in 1657, named Longueuil after a village which is today the seat of a canton in the district of [[Dieppe, France|Dieppe]] in his homeland of [[Normandy]].\n\nHis son, [[Charles le Moyne de Longueuil, Baron de Longueuil|Charles Le Moyne de Longueuil]], built [[Fort Longueuil]] as his fortified residence.

It was demolished in 1810 due to its poor condition.<ref name=\"CRHP\" /> The [[Archaeology|archaeological remains]] of Fort Longueuil were recognized as a [[National Historic Site of Canada]] on May 25, 1923.  The site extends beneath the present-day [[Co-Cathedral of Saint-Antoine-de-Padoue|Saint-Antoine-de-Padoue Cathedral]].<ref name=\"CRHP\" />\n[[File:The church and Rue St. Charles, Longueuil, QC, about 1910.jpg|thumbnail|left|The [[Co-Cathedral of Saint-Antoine-de-Padoue]] and Rue St. Charles, Longueuil, QC, about 1910]]\nThe seigneurial system ended in 1845 and Longueuil was turned into a [[parish municipality (Quebec)|parish municipality]] named Saint-Antoine-de-Longueuil.<ref name=\"CanadianEncyclopedia\"/> In 1848, a portion detached from the parish and officially established as the [[Old Longueuil|village of Longueuil]]. This same village became a town in 1874, and then a city in 1920.<ref name=\"CanadianEncyclopedia\"/> Musician [[Paul Pratt]] notably served as the city's mayor from 1935-1966.\n\nLongueuil's city limits expanded for the first time in 1961 when it merged with [[Montr\u00e9al-Sud]], and again in 1969 when it merged with [[Ville Jacques-Cartier]].<ref name=\"CanadianEncyclopedia\"/> In both cases, Longueuil was chosen as the name of the new city.\n\nOn January 1, 2002, as part of the [[2000\u20132006 municipal reorganization in Quebec]], the provincial government amalgamated [[Le Vieux-Longueuil|the former Longueuil]] with [[Boucherville]], [[Brossard]], [[Greenfield Park, Quebec|Greenfield Park]], [[LeMoyne, Quebec|LeMoyne]], [[Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville]], [[Saint-Hubert, Quebec|Saint-Hubert]] and [[Saint-Lambert, Quebec|Saint-Lambert]]. As with the 1960s, the name Longueuil was chosen for the new city.  However, after a [[2003 Quebec general election|change of government]] and a [[2004 Quebec municipal referendums|2004 referendum]], Boucherville, Brossard, Saint-Lambert and Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville were re-constituted as independent cities on January 1, 2006.  As such, the current city of Longueuil now includes only the former cities of Longueuil (1969-2002), Saint-Hubert, Greenfield Park and LeMoyne.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Longueuil Quebec location diagram.PNG|thumb|left|Location of the city of Longueuil within the [[Urban Agglomeration of Longueuil]].]]\nLongueuil occupies 115.59&nbsp;square kilometres (44.6&nbsp;sq mi) of land. The city is bordered by the cities of [[Saint-Lambert, Quebec|Saint-Lambert]] and [[Brossard]] to the west, [[Boucherville]] and [[Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville]] to the east, and the [[Saint Lawrence River]] and Montreal to the north. The city of Longueuil is located approximately 7&nbsp;kilometres (5&nbsp;mi) south of [[Montreal]] on the [[South Shore (Montreal)|south shore]] of the [[Saint Lawrence River]].\n\nLongueuil is located in the Saint Lawrence River [[valley]], and is a vast [[plain]]. Areas near the river were originally [[swamp]] land with [[mixed forest]], and later prime agricultural land. Agricultural land still exists in the portions of the city furthest from the river.\n\nThe city of Longueuil also includes [[\u00cele Charron]], a small [[island]] in the Saint Lawrence River, and part of the [[Boucherville Islands]].\n\nLike Montreal, Longueuil is classified as [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]] or [[hemiboreal]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfb''). Longueuil has long winters, lasting from November to March, short springs during April and May, average summers, lasting from June to August, and short autumns during September and October.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Montr\u00e9al/Saint-Hubert Airport (1981-2010)\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n\n|Jan maximum humidex = 15.4\n|Feb maximum humidex = 15.5\n|Mar maximum

It is the seat of the [[Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie|Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie administrative region]] and the central city of the [[urban agglomeration of Longueuil]]. It sits on the [[South Shore (Montreal)|south shore]] of the [[Saint Lawrence River]] directly across from [[Montreal]]. The population as of the [[Canada 2016 Census]] totalled 239,700, making it Montreal's second largest suburb, the fifth most populous city in Quebec and [[List of the 100 largest municipalities in Canada by population|twentieth]] largest in Canada.\n\n[[Charles le Moyne de Longueuil et de Ch\u00e2teauguay|Charles Le Moyne]] founded Longueuil  as a ''[[Seigneurial system of New France|seigneurie]]'' in 1657. It would become a parish in 1845, a village in 1848, a town in 1874 and a city in 1920. Between 1961 and 2002, Longueuil's borders grew three times, as it was amalgamated with surrounding municipalities; there was a strong de-amalgamation in 2006 (see [[2000\u20132006 municipal reorganization in Quebec]]).\n\nLongueuil is a residential, commercial and industrial city. It incorporates some [[urban area|urban]] features, but is essentially a [[suburb]]. Longueuil can be classified as a [[commuter town]] as a large portion of its residents commute to work in Montreal. Most buildings are single-family homes constructed in the post-war period. The city consists of three boroughs: [[Le Vieux-Longueuil]], [[Saint-Hubert, Quebec|Saint-Hubert]] and [[Greenfield Park, Quebec|Greenfield Park]].\n\nLongueuil is the seat of the [[Judicial districts of Quebec|judicial district]] of Longueuil.<ref>[http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=2&file=/D_11/D11_A.HTM ''Territorial Division Act'']. ''Revised Statutes of Quebec'' D-11.</ref> Residents of the city are called ''Longueuillois''.\n\n==History==\n{{Expand section|date=March 2009}}\n[[File:Fort Longueuil 1825.jpg|thumb|left|Ruins of [[Fort Longueuil]] in 1825.]]\nThe territory of [[New France]] was divided into [[Seigneurial system of New France|seigneuries]] in order to ensure the colony's defence. Longueuil was founded in 1657 by [[Charles le Moyne de Longueuil et de Ch\u00e2teauguay|Charles Le Moyne]], a merchant from [[Fort Ville-Marie|Ville-Marie]] (present day Montreal), as a [[Seigneurial system of New France|seigneurie]].<ref name=\"CanadianEncyclopedia\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/longueuil|title=Longueuil|last=LINTEAU|first=PAUL-ANDR\u00c9|author2=CLAIRE POITRAS |work=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|publisher=[[Historica-Dominion Institute]]|accessdate=25 February 2012}}</ref> According to Abb\u00e9 Faillon, Charles Le Moyne, lord of the area starting in 1657, named Longueuil after a village which is today the seat of a canton in the district of [[Dieppe, France|Dieppe]] in his homeland of [[Normandy]].\n\nHis son, [[Charles le Moyne de Longueuil, Baron de Longueuil|Charles Le Moyne de Longueuil]], built [[Fort Longueuil]] as his fortified residence. It was constructed of stone between 1685 and 1690 and had four towers.<ref name=\"CRHP\">{{CRHP|14401|Fort Longueuil|7 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nFort Longueuil was believed to be occupied by [[United States|American]] troops during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. It was subsequently occupied by the [[United Kingdom|British]]. It was demolished in 1810 due to its poor condition.<ref name=\"CRHP\" /> The [[Archaeology|archaeological remains]] of Fort Longueuil were recognized as a [[National Historic Site of Canada]] on May 25, 1923.  The site extends beneath the present-day [[Co-Cathedral of Saint-Antoine-de-Padoue|Saint-Antoine-de-Padoue Cathedral]].<ref name=\"CRHP\" />\n[[File:The church and Rue St. Charles, Longueuil, QC, about 1910.jpg|thumbnail|left|The [[Co-Cathedral of Saint-Antoine-de-Padoue]] and Rue St. Charles, Longueuil, QC, about 1910]]\nThe seigneurial system ended in 1845 and Longueuil was turned into a [[parish municipality (Quebec)|parish municipality]] named Saint-Antoine-de-Longueuil.<ref name=\"CanadianEncyclopedia\"/> In 1848, a portion detached from the parish and officially established as the [[Old Longueuil|village of Longueuil]]. This same village became a town in 1874, and then a city in 1920.<ref name=\"CanadianEncyclopedia\"/> Musician [[Paul Pratt]] notably served as the city's mayor from 1935-1966.\n\nLongueuil's city limits expanded for the first time in 1961 when it merged with [[Montr\u00e9al-Sud]], and again in 1969 when it merged with [[Ville Jacques-Cartier]].<ref name=\"CanadianEncyclopedia\"/> In both cases, Longueuil was chosen as the name of the new city.\n\nOn January 1, 2002, as part of the [[2000\u20132006 municipal reorganization in Quebec]], the provincial government amalgamated [[Le Vieux-Longueuil|the former Longueuil]] with [[Boucherville]], [[Brossard]], [[Greenfield Park, Quebec|Greenfield Park]], [[LeMoyne, Quebec|LeMoyne]], [[Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville]], [[Saint-Hubert, Quebec|Saint-Hubert]] and [[Saint-Lambert, Quebec|Saint-Lambert]]. As with the 1960s, the name Longueuil was chosen for the new city.  However, after a [[2003 Quebec general election|change of government]] and a [[2004 Quebec municipal referendums|2004 referendum]], Boucherville, Brossard, Saint-Lambert and Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville were re-constituted as independent cities on January 1, 2006.  As such, the current city of Longueuil now includes only the former cities of Longueuil (1969-2002), Saint-Hubert, Greenfield Park and LeMoyne.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Longueuil Quebec location diagram.PNG|thumb|left|Location of the city of Longueuil within the [[Urban Agglomeration of Longueuil]].]]\nLongueuil occupies 115.59&nbsp;square kilometres (44.6&nbsp;sq mi) of land. The city is bordered by the cities of [[Saint-Lambert, Quebec|Saint-Lambert]] and [[Brossard]] to the west, [[Boucherville]] and [[Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville]] to the east, and the [[Saint Lawrence River]] and Montreal to the north. The city of Longueuil is located approximately 7&nbsp;kilometres (5&nbsp;mi) south of [[Montreal]] on the [[South Shore (Montreal)|south shore]] of the [[Saint Lawrence River]].\n\nLongueuil is located in the Saint Lawrence River [[valley]], and is a vast [[plain]]. Areas near the river were originally [[swamp]] land with [[mixed forest]], and later prime agricultural land. Agricultural land still exists in the portions of the city furthest from the river.\n\nThe city of Longueuil also includes [[\u00cele Charron]], a small [[island]] in the Saint Lawrence River, and part of the [[Boucherville Islands]].\n\nLike Montreal, Longueuil is classified as [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]] or [[hemiboreal]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfb''). Longueuil has long winters, lasting from November to March, short springs during April and May, average summers, lasting from June to August, and short autumns during September and October.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Montr\u00e9al/Saint-Hubert Airport (1981-2010)\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n\n|Jan maximum humidex = 15.4\n|Feb maximum humidex = 15.5\n|Mar maximum

Secure Digital changed the MMC design in several ways:\n\n* Asymmetrical shape of the sides of the SD card prevent inserting it upside down (while an MMC goes in most of the way but makes no contact if inverted).\n* Most SD cards are {{convert|2.1|mm|abbr=in}} thick, compared to {{convert|1.4|mm|abbr=in}} for MMCs.

Both read and write speeds must exceed the specified value. The specification defines these classes in terms of performance curves that translate into the following minimum read-write performance levels on an empty card and suitability for different applications:<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" /><ref name=\"sda_speed_class\"/><ref name=\"sda_speed_class_consumer\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sdcard.org/consumers/choices/speed_class/index.html|title=Speed Class Standards for Video Recording - SD Association|website=www.sdcard.org}}</ref><ref name=\"sda_logos_2017\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sdcard.org/consumers/pdf/2017SDA_brochure_eng.pdf|title=SD Standards Brochure 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe SD Association defines three types of Speed Class ratings: the original Speed Class, UHS Speed Class, and Video Speed Class.\n\n===== Speed Class =====\n'''Speed Class''' ratings 2, 4, and 6 assert that the card supports the respective number of megabytes per second as a minimum sustained write speed for a card in a fragmented state. Class 10 asserts that the card supports 10&nbsp;MB/s as a minimum non-fragmented sequential write speed and uses a High Speed bus mode.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" /> The host device can read a card's speed class and warn the user if the card reports a speed class that falls below an application's minimum need.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" /> By comparison, the older \"\u00d7\" rating measured maximum speed under ideal conditions, and was vague as to whether this was read speed or write speed. The graphical symbol for the speed class has a number encircled with 'C' (C2, C4, C6, and C10).\n\n===== UHS Speed Class =====\nUHS-I and UHS-II cards can use '''UHS Speed Class''' rating with two possible grades: class 1 for minimum read/write performance of at least 10&nbsp;MB/s ('U1' symbol featuring number 1 inside 'U') and class 3 for minimum write performance of 30&nbsp;MB/s ('U3' symbol featuring 3 inside 'U'), targeted at recording [[4K video]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sdcard.org/home/New_SDXC_and_SDHC_Memory_Cards_Now_Support_4K2K_Video_11-6-2013_FINAL_2.pdf |title=NEW SDXC AND SDHC MEMORY CARDS SUPPORT 4K2K VIDEO |publisher=SD Association |date= |accessdate=2013-11-13}}</ref> Before November 2013, the rating was branded ''UHS Speed Grade'' and contained grades 0 (no symbol) and 1 ('U1' symbol). Manufacturers can also display standard speed class symbols (C2, C4, C6, and C10) alongside, or in place of UHS speed class.\n\nUHS memory cards work best with UHS host devices. The combination lets the user record HD resolution videos with [[tapeless camcorder]]s while performing other functions. It is also suitable for real-time broadcasts and capturing large HD videos.\n\n===== Video Speed Class =====\n'''Video Speed Class''' defines a set of requirements for UHS cards to match the modern [[Multi-level cell|MLC NAND flash]] memory<ref name=\"sd50_video_speed\"/> and supports progressive 4K and 8K video with minimum sequential writing speeds of 6-90&nbsp;MB/s.<ref name=\"sda_video_speed\"/><ref name=\"sda_speed_class\"/><ref name=\"sda_speed_class_consumer\"/> The graphical symbols use 'V' followed by a number designating write speed (V6, V10, V30, V60, and V90).\n\n===== Comparison =====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Comparison of SD card Speed Class ratings<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sdcard.org/developers/overview/speed_class/index.html|title=Speed Class - SD Association|website=www.sdcard.org|accessdate=2019-02-15}}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Minimum sequential writing speed\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | Speed Class\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"4\" | [[Video format]]{{Efn|The necessary recording and playback speed class requirements may vary by device.}}\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Speed Class\n! scope=\"col\" | UHS Speed Class\n! scope=\"col\" | Video Speed Class \n! scope=\"col\" | [[Standard-definition television|SD]]\n! scope=\"col\" | [[High-definition video|HD]]/[[Full HD]]\n! scope=\"col\" | [[4K resolution|4K]]\n! scope=\"col\" | [[8K resolution|8K]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{nowrap|2 [[MB/s]]}}\n| {{nowrap|[[File:SDHC Speed Class 2.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 2 (C2)}}\n| {{N/a}} \n| {{N/a}} \n| rowspan=\"7\" {{Yes}}\n| {{No}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" {{No}}\n| rowspan=\"4\" {{No}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{nowrap|4 MB/s}}\n| {{nowrap|[[File:SDHC Speed Class 4.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 4 (C4)}}\n| {{N/a}} \n| {{N/a}}  \n| rowspan=\"6\" {{Yes}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{nowrap|6 MB/s}}\n| {{nowrap|[[File:SDHC Speed Class 6.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 6 (C6)}}\n| {{N/a}} \n| {{nowrap|[[File:SD Video Speed Class 6.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 6 (V6)}}\n| rowspan=\"5\" {{Yes}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{nowrap|10 MB/s}}\n| {{nowrap|[[File:SD Class 10.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 10 (C10)}}\n| {{nowrap|[[File:SD UHS Speed Class 1.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 1 (U1)}}\n| {{nowrap|[[File:SD Video Speed Class 10.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 10 (V10)}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{nowrap|30 MB/s}}\n| {{N/a}} \n| {{nowrap|[[File:SD UHS Speed Class 3.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 3 (U3)}}\n| {{nowrap|[[File:SD Video Speed Class 30.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 30 (V30)}}\n| rowspan=\"3\" {{Yes}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{nowrap|60 MB/s}}\n| {{N/a}} \n| {{N/a}} \n| {{nowrap|[[File:SD Video Speed Class 60.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 60 (V60)}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{nowrap|90 MB/s}}\n| {{N/a}} \n| {{N/a}} \n| {{nowrap|[[File:SD Video Speed Class 90.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 90 (V90)}}\n|}\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==== Application Performance Class ====\n''Application Performance Class'' is a newly defined standard from the SD Specification 5.1 and 6.0 which not only define sequential Reading Speeds but also mandates a minimum [[IOPS]] for reading and writing.

Basic cards transfer data at up to six times (6\u00d7) the CD-ROM speed; that is, 900&nbsp;KiB/s or 7.37&nbsp;Mbit/s. The 2.0 specification{{clarify|reason=which specification|date=September 2013}} defines speeds up to 200\u00d7, but is not as specific as Speed Classes are on how to measure speed. Manufacturers may report best-case speeds and may report the card's fastest read speed, which is typically faster than the write speed. Some vendors, including [[Transcend Information|Transcend]] and [[Kingston Technology|Kingston]], report their cards' write speed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kingston.com/us/flash/x-speed |title=Flash Memory Cards and X-Speed Ratings |website=Kingston |accessdate=2017-08-05 }}</ref> When a card lists both a speed class and an \"\u00d7\" rating, the latter may be assumed a read speed only.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Real-world performance===\nIn applications that require sustained write throughput, such as video recording, the device might not perform satisfactorily if the SD card's class rating falls below a particular speed. For example, a high-definition [[camcorder]] may require a card of not less than Class 6, suffering dropouts or corrupted video if a slower card is used. [[Digital camera]]s with slow cards may take a noticeable time after taking a photograph before being ready for the next, while the camera writes the first picture.\n\nThe speed class rating does not totally characterize card performance. Different cards of the same class may vary considerably while meeting class specifications. A card's speed depends on many factors, including:\n* The frequency of soft errors that the card's controller must re-try\n* [[Write amplification]]: The flash controller may need to overwrite more data than requested. This has to do with performing read-modify-write operations on write blocks, freeing up (the much larger) erase blocks, while moving data around to achieve [[wear leveling]].\n* [[File fragmentation]]: where there is not sufficient space for a file to be recorded in a contiguous region, it is split into non-contiguous fragments. This does not cause rotational or head-movement delays as with electromechanical [[hard drive]]s, but may decrease speed\u2060\u200a\u2060\u200a\u2060\u2015\u200a\u200afor instance, by requiring additional reads and computation to determine where on the card the file's next fragment is stored.\n\nIn addition, speed may vary markedly between writing a large amount of data to a single file ([[sequential access]], as when a [[digital camera]] records large photographs or videos) and writing a large number of small files (a [[random access|random-access]] use common in [[smartphone]]s). A study in 2012 found that, in this random-access use, some Class 2 cards achieved a write speed of 1.38&nbsp;[[MB/s]], while all cards tested of Class 6 or greater (and some of lower Classes; lower Class does not ''necessarily'' mean better small-file performance), including those from major manufacturers, were over 100 times slower.<ref name=necstudy/> In 2014, a blogger measured a 300-fold performance difference on small writes; this time, the best card in this category was a class 4 card.<ref name=Gough2014/>\n\n==Features==\n\n===Card security===\nCards can protect their contents from erasure or modification, prevent access by non-authorized users, and protect copyrighted content using digital rights management.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n====Commands to disable writes====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\nThe host device can command the SD card to become read-only (to reject subsequent commands to write information to it). There are both reversible and irreversible host commands that achieve this.\n\n====Write-protect notch====\n[[File:SD card unlocked and locked.svg|thumb|Unlocked and locked SD cards]]\n[[File:Sony toughcard notch less design.jpg|thumb|Sony 128GB SF-G Tough Series UHS-II SDXC Memory Card is one of the few cards in the market without a sliding tab on the write protect notch.]]\n\nMost full-size SD cards have a \"mechanical write protect switch\" allowing the user to advise the host computer that the user wants the device to be treated as read-only. This does not protect the data on the card if the host is compromised: ''\"It is the responsibility of the host to protect the card. The position of the write protect switch is unknown to the internal circuitry of the card.\"''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/pls/index.html|title=Simplified Specifications - SD Association, version 3.10 , Part 1, Physical Layer, section 4.3.6\" Write Protect Management\"|last=|first=|date=|website=www.sdcard.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|accessdate=2019-04-11}}</ref> Some host devices do not support write protection, which is an optional feature of the SD specification, and drivers and devices that do obey a read-only indication may give the user a way to override it.\n\nThe switch is a sliding tab that covers a notch in the card. The miniSD and microSD formats do not directly support a write protection notch, but they can be inserted into full-size adapters which do.\n\nWhen looking at the SD card from the top, the right side (the side with the beveled corner) must be notched.\n\nOn the left side, there may be a write-protection notch. If the notch is omitted, the card can be read and written. If the card is notched, it is read-only. If the card has a notch and a sliding tab which covers the notch, the user can slide the tab upward (toward the contacts) to declare the card read/write, or downward to declare it read-only. The diagram to the right shows an orange sliding write-protect tab in both the unlocked and locked positions.\n\nCards sold with content that must not be altered are permanently marked read-only by having a notch and no sliding tab.\n\n====Card password====\n[[File:Sdadaptersandcards.jpg|thumb|MicroSD to SD adapter (left), microSD to miniSD adapter (middle), microSD card (right)]]\n\nA host device can lock an SD card using a password of up to 16&nbsp;bytes, typically supplied by the user. A locked card interacts normally with the host device except that it rejects commands to read and write data. A locked card can be unlocked only by providing the same password. The host device can, after supplying the old password, specify a new password or disable locking. Without the password (typically, in the case that the user forgets the password), the host device can command the card to erase all the data on the card for future re-use (except card data under DRM), but there is no way to gain access to the existing data.\n\n[[Windows Phone 7]] devices use SD cards designed for access only by the phone manufacturer or mobile provider. An SD card inserted into the phone underneath the battery compartment becomes locked \"to the phone with an automatically generated key\" so that \"the SD card cannot be read by another phone, device, or PC\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2450831|title=Windows Phone 7 Secure Digital Card Limitations}}</ref> [[Symbian OS|Symbian]] devices, however, are some of the few that can perform the necessary low-level format operations on locked SD cards.

SDIO cards are only fully functional in host devices designed to support their input-output functions (typically PDAs like the [[Palm Treo]], but occasionally laptops or mobile phones). These devices can use the SD slot to support [[GPS]] receivers, [[modem]]s, [[barcode reader]]s, [[FM radio]] tuners, TV tuners, [[RFID]] readers, [[digital camera]]s, and interfaces to [[Wi-Fi]], [[Bluetooth]], [[Ethernet]], and [[Infrared Data Association|IrDA]]. Many other SDIO devices have been proposed, but it is now more common for I/O devices to connect using the USB interface.\n\nSDIO cards support most of the memory commands of SD cards. SDIO cards can be structured as eight logical cards, although currently, the typical way that an SDIO card uses this capability is to structure itself as one I/O card and one memory card.\n\nThe SDIO and SD interfaces are mechanically and electrically identical. Host devices built for SDIO cards generally accept SD memory cards without I/O functions. However, the reverse is not true, because host devices need suitable drivers and applications to support the card's I/O functions. For example, an HP SDIO camera usually does not work with PDAs that do not list it as an accessory. Inserting an SDIO card into any SD slot causes no physical damage nor disruption to the host device, but users may be frustrated that the SDIO card does not function fully when inserted into a seemingly compatible slot. (USB and Bluetooth devices exhibit comparable compatibility issues, although to a lesser extent thanks to standardized [[Class driver|USB device classes]] and [[Bluetooth profiles]].)\n\nThe [[#SDIO|SDIO]] family comprises Low-Speed and Full-Speed cards. Both types of SDIO cards support SPI and one-bit SD bus types. Low-Speed SDIO cards are allowed to also support the four-bit SD bus; Full-Speed SDIO cards are required to support the four-bit SD bus. To use an SDIO card as a \"combo card\" (for both memory and I/O), the host device must first select four-bit SD bus operation. Two other unique features of Low-Speed SDIO are a maximum clock rate of 400&nbsp;kHz for all communications, and the use of Pin 8 as \"interrupt\" to try to initiate dialogue with the host device.<ref name=\"SDIOspec\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sdcard.org/developers/overview/sdio/sdio_spec/|title=Simplified Version of SDIO CARD SPEC|publisher=SD Association|accessdate=2011-12-09}}</ref>\n\n; Ganging cards together\nThe one-bit SD protocol was derived from the MMC protocol, which envisioned the ability to put up to three cards on a bus of common signal lines. The cards use [[open collector]] interfaces, where a card may pull a line to the low voltage level; the line is at the high voltage level (because of a [[pull-up resistor]]) if no card pulls it low. Though the cards shared clock and signal lines, each card had its own [[chip select]] line to sense that the host device had selected it.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe SD protocol envisioned the ability to gang 30 cards together without separate chip select lines. The host device would broadcast commands to all cards and identify the card to respond to the command using its unique serial number.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nIn practice, cards are rarely ganged together because open-collector operation has problems at high speeds and increases power consumption. Newer versions of the SD specification recommend separate lines to each card.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Compatibility===\nHost devices that comply with newer versions of the specification provide [[backward compatibility]] and accept older SD cards.<ref name=\"sdcard.org\"/> For example, SDXC host devices accept all previous families of SD memory cards, and SDHC host devices also accept standard SD cards.\n\nOlder host devices generally do not support newer card formats, and even when they might support the bus interface used by the card,<ref name=sdcard_using_sdxc /> there are several factors that arise:\n\n* A newer card may offer [[#Types of cards|greater capacity]] than the host device can handle (over 4 GB for SDHC, over 32 GB for SDXC).\n* A newer card may use a [[#File system|file system]] the host device cannot navigate ([[FAT32]] for SDHC, [[exFAT]] for SDXC)\n* Use of an SDIO card requires the host device be designed for the input/output functions the card provides.\n* The hardware interface of the card was changed starting with the version 2.0 (new high-speed bus clocks, redefinition of [[#Storage capacity calculations|storage capacity bits]]) and [[#SDHC|SDHC]] family (Ultra-high speed (UHS) bus)\n* UHS-II has physically more pins but is backwards compatible to UHS-I and non-UHS for both slot and card.<ref name=\"sda_bus_speed\"/>\n* Some vendors produced SDSC cards above&nbsp;1GB before the SDA had standardized a method of doing so.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ SD compatibility table\n! {{Diagonal split header|Slot|Card}}\n! scope=\"col\" | SDSC\n! scope=\"col\" | SDHC\n! scope=\"col\" | SDHC<br/>UHS\n! scope=\"col\" | SDXC\n! scope=\"col\" | SDXC<br/>UHS \n! scope=\"col\" | SDIO\n|- \n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDSC\n| {{Partial}}{{Efn|name=sdsccompat|See [[#Storage_capacity_and_compatibilities|discussion about storage capacity and compatibilities]]}} || {{Partial|FAT16,<4GiB}}{{Efn|name=sdsccompat}} || {{Partial|FAT16,<4GiB}}{{Efn|name=sdsccompat}} || {{No}} || {{No}} || {{No}}\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDHC\n| {{Yes}} || {{Yes}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs|In non-UHS mode}}}} || {{Partial|FAT32}} || {{Partial|FAT32{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}}  || {{No}}\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDHC UHS\n| {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} ||  {{Yes|Yes{{Efn|name=uhs|In UHS mode}}}} || {{Partial|FAT32{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} || {{Partial|FAT32{{Efn|name=uhs}}}} ||  {{No}}\n|- \n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDXC\n| {{Yes}} || {{Yes}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} || {{Yes}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}}  || {{No}}\n|- \n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDXC UHS\n| {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} ||  {{Yes|Yes{{Efn|name=uhs}}}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}}|| {{Yes|Yes{{Efn|name=uhs}}}} || {{No}}\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDIO\n| {{partial|Varies}} ||  {{partial|Varies}} || {{partial|Varies}} || {{partial|Varies}} || {{partial|Varies}} || {{Yes}}\n|}\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==Markets==\nSecure Digital cards are used in many consumer electronic devices, and have become a widespread means of storing several gigabytes of data in a small size.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Devices in which the user may remove and replace cards often, such as [[digital camera]]s, [[camcorder]]s, and [[video game console]]s, tend to use full-sized cards.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Devices in which small size is paramount, such as [[mobile phone]]s, tend to use microSD cards.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe microSD card has helped propel the smartphone market by giving both manufacturers and consumers greater flexibility and freedom.{{According to whom|date=October 2016}} Due to their compact size, microSD cards are used in many{{Which|date=October 2016}} different applications in a large variety{{Which|date=October 2016}} of markets.

The files that were copied back can be tested either by comparing checksums (e.g. [[Md5sum|MD5]]), or trying to [[Data compression|compress]] them. The latter approach leverages the fact that counterfeited cards let the user read back files, which then consist of easily compressible uniform data (for example, repeating [[0xFF]]s).\n\n===Digital cameras===\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2016}}\nSD/MMC cards replaced [[Toshiba]]'s [[SmartMedia]] as the dominant memory card format used in digital cameras. In 2001, SmartMedia had achieved nearly 50% use, but by 2005 SD/MMC had achieved over 40% of the digital camera market and SmartMedia's share had plummeted by 2007.\n\nAt this time, all the leading digital camera manufacturers used SD in their consumer product lines, including [[Canon Inc.|Canon]], [[Casio]], [[Fujifilm]], [[Kodak]], [[Leica Camera|Leica]], [[Nikon]], [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]], [[Panasonic]], [[Pentax]], [[Ricoh]], [[Samsung]], and [[Sony]]. Formerly, [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]] and [[Fujifilm]] used [[XD-Picture Card]]s (xD cards) exclusively, while [[Sony]] only used [[Memory Stick]]; by early 2010 all three supported SD.\n\nSome [[prosumer]] and professional digital cameras continued to offer [[CompactFlash]] (CF), either on a second card slot or as the only storage, as CF supports much higher maximum capacities and historically was cheaper for the same capacity.\n\nSecure Digital memory cards can be used in Sony [[XDCAM]] EX [[camcorder]]s with an adapter<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pro.sony.com/bbsc/ssr/micro-xdcamexsite/cat-accessories/product-MEADSD01/ |title=MEAD-SD01 SDHC card adapter (Sony) |publisher=Pro.sony.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref> and in Panasonic [[P2 (storage media)|P2 card]] equipment with a [[MicroP2]] adapter.\n\n===Personal computers===\nAlthough many [[personal computer]]s accommodate SD cards as an auxiliary storage device using a built-in slot, or can accommodate SD cards by means of a USB adapter, SD cards cannot be used as the primary [[hard disk]] through the onboard [[Parallel ATA|ATA]] controller, because none of the SD card variants support ATA signalling.

However, on computers that support [[bootstrapping]] from a USB interface, an SD card in a USB adapter can be the primary hard disk, provided it contains an operating system that supports USB access once the bootstrap is complete.\n\nSince late 2009, newer [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] computers with installed SD card readers have been able to boot in [[macOS]] from SD storage devices, when properly formatted to [[HFS Plus|Mac OS Extended]] file format and the default partition table set to [[GUID Partition Table]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3553 |title=About the SD and SDXC card slot |publisher=Support.apple.com |date=2013-06-08 |accessdate=2013-11-13}}</ref> (See [[#File system|Other file systems]] below).\n\nSD cards are increasing in usage and popular among owners of vintage computers like [[Atari 8-bit family|8-bit Atari]]. For example SIO2SD ([[Atari SIO|SIO]] is an Atari port for connecting external devices) is used nowadays. It may be an interesting fact that the whole collection of software for an 8-bit Atari may be included on one SD card that may have less than 4-8 GB of disk size (2019).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://retrohax.net/sio2sd-for-atari/|title=SIO2SD for 8-bit Atari|date=May 9, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Embedded systems===\n[[File:Arduino Ethernet Shield (pre-production sample).jpg|thumb|A shield ([[daughterboard]]) that gives [[Arduino]] prototyping microprocessors access to SD cards]]\n\nIn 2008, the SDA specified Embedded SD, \"leverag[ing] well-known SD standards\" to enable non-removable SD-style devices on printed circuit boards.<ref>{{cite web|title=Embedded SD|publisher=SD Association|url=http://www.sdcard.org/developers/overview/embedded_sd/|accessdate=2011-11-30}}</ref> However this standard was not adopted by the market while the [[MultiMediaCard|MMC]] standard became the de facto standard for embedded systems.

The SPI bus mode and one-bit SD bus mode are mandatory for all SD families, as explained in the next section. Once the host device and the SD card negotiate a bus interface mode, the usage of the numbered pins is the same for all card sizes.\n* '''SPI bus mode:''' [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus]] is primarily used by embedded [[microcontroller]]s. This bus type supports only a 3.3-volt interface. This is the only bus type that does not require a host license.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n* '''One-bit SD bus mode:''' Separate command and data channels and a proprietary transfer format.\n* '''Four-bit SD bus mode:''' Uses extra pins plus some reassigned pins. This is the same protocol as the one-bit SD bus mode which uses one command and four data lines for faster data transfer. All SD cards support this mode. UHS-I and UHS-II require this bus type.\n* '''Two differential lines SD UHS-II mode:''' Uses two low-voltage differential interfaces to transfer commands and data. UHS-II cards include this interface in addition to the SD bus modes.\n\nThe physical interface comprises 9 pins, except that the miniSD card adds two unconnected pins in the center and the microSD card omits one of the two V<sub>SS</sub> (Ground) pins.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/pls/simplified_specs/part1_410.pdf |title=SD Part 1, Physical Layer Simplified Specification, Version 4.10 |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202232415/https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/pls/simplified_specs/part1_410.pdf |archive-date=2013-12-02 |df= }}</ref>\n\n[[File:MMC-SD-miniSD-microSD-Color-Numbers-Names.gif|thumb|upright|Official pin numbers for each card type (top to bottom): [[MultiMediaCard|MMC]], SD, miniSD, microSD.

The host device thereby sends 48-bit commands and receives responses. The card can signal that a response will be delayed, but the host device can abort the dialogue.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\"/>\n\nThrough issuing various commands, the host device can:<ref name=\"SDHCspec\"/>\n* Determine the type, memory capacity, and capabilities of the SD card\n* Command the card to use a different voltage, different clock speed, or advanced electrical interface\n* Prepare the card to receive a block to write to the flash memory, or read and reply with the contents of a specified block.\n\nThe command interface is an extension of the [[MultiMediaCard]] (MMC) interface. SD cards dropped support for some of the commands in the MMC protocol, but added commands related to copy protection. By using only commands supported by both standards until determining the type of card inserted, a host device can accommodate both SD and MMC cards.\n\n====Electrical interface====\nAll SD card families initially use a 3.3&nbsp;[[volt]] electrical interface. On command, SDHC and SDXC cards can switch to 1.8&nbsp;V operation.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" />\n\nAt initial power-up or card insertion, the host device selects either the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) bus or the one-bit SD bus by the voltage level present on Pin 1. Thereafter, the host device may issue a command to switch to the four-bit SD bus interface, if the SD card supports it. For various card types, support for the four-bit SD bus is either optional or mandatory.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" />\n\nAfter determining that the SD card supports it, the host device can also command the SD card to switch to a [[#Speed|higher transfer speed]]. Until determining the card's capabilities, the host device should not use a clock speed faster than 400&nbsp;kHz. SD cards other than SDIO (see below) have a \"Default Speed\" clock rate of 25&nbsp;MHz. The host device is not required to use the maximum clock speed that the card supports. It may operate at less than the maximum clock speed to conserve power.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" /> Between commands, the host device can stop the clock entirely.\n\n====Achieving higher card speeds====\nThe SD specification defines four-bit-wide transfers. (The MMC specification supports this and also defines an eight-bit-wide mode; MMC cards with extended bits were not accepted by the market.) Transferring several bits on each clock pulse improves the card speed. Advanced SD families have also improved speed by offering faster clock frequencies and double data rate (explained [[#UHS Speed Class|here]]) in a high-speed differential interface (UHS-II).{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===File system===\nLike other types of [[flash memory]] card, an SD card of any SD family is a [[block (data storage)|block-addressable]] [[Data storage device|storage device]], in which the host device can read or write fixed-size blocks by specifying their block number.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n====MBR and FAT====\nMost SD cards ship preformatted with one or more [[Master boot record|MBR partitions]], where the first or only partition contains a [[file system]].

Universal support for FAT12, FAT16, FAT16B, and FAT32 allows the use of SDSC and SDHC cards on most host computers with a compatible SD reader, to present the user with the familiar method of named files in a hierarchical directory tree.\n\nOn such SD cards, standard utility programs such as Mac OS X's \"{{nowrap|[[Disk Utility]]}}\" or Windows' [[SCANDISK]] can be used to repair a corrupted filing system and sometimes recover deleted files. [[Defragmentation]] tools for FAT file systems may be used on such cards. The resulting consolidation of files may provide a marginal improvement in the time required to read or write the file,<ref name=\"Fragmentation_and_Speed\">{{Citation | url = https://www.sdcard.org/developers/overview/speed_class/ | title = Fragmentation and Speed | publisher = SD Card}}</ref> but not an improvement comparable to defragmentation of hard drives, where storing a file in multiple fragments requires additional physical, and relatively slow, movement of a drive head. Moreover, defragmentation performs writes to the SD card that count against the card's rated lifespan. The write endurance of the physical memory is discussed in the article on [[Flash memory degradation|flash memory]]; newer technology to increase the storage capacity of a card provides worse write endurance.\n\nWhen reformatting an SD card with a capacity of at least 32&nbsp;MB (65536 logical sectors or more), but not more than 2&nbsp;GB, [[FAT16B]] with partition type [[Partition type#PID 06h|06h]] and [[EBPB 4.1]]<ref name=\"SDG_2000_SD-P2-V1.0\"/> is recommended if the card is for a consumer device. (FAT16B is also an option for 4&nbsp;GB cards, but it requires the use of 64&nbsp;KiB [[cluster (file system)|clusters]], which are not widely supported.) FAT16B does not support cards above 4&nbsp;GB at all.\n\nThe SDXC specification mandates the use of [[Microsoft]]'s [[proprietary format|proprietary]] [[exFAT]] file system,<ref name=\"engadget_sdxc_2t_300m\">{{cite web | url = https://www.engadget.com/2009/01/07/sdxc-memory-cards-promise-2tb-of-storage-300mbps-transfer/ |title = SDXC memory cards promise 2 TB of storage, 300 MBps transfer | publisher=Engadget |date= 2009-01-07 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref> which sometimes requires appropriate drivers (e.g. <code>exfat-utils</code>/<code>exfat-fuse</code> on Linux).\n\n====Other file systems====\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2016}}\nBecause the host views the SD card as a block storage device, the card does not require MBR partitions or any specific file system. The card can be reformatted to use any file system the operating system supports. For example:\n* Under [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], SD cards can be formatted using [[NTFS]] and, on later versions, [[exFAT]].\n* Under [[macOS]], SD cards can be partitioned as [[GUID Partition Table|GUID]] devices and formatted with either [[HFS Plus]] or [[Apple File System|APFS]] file systems or still use [[exFAT]].\n* Under [[Unix-like]] operating systems such as [[Linux]] or [[FreeBSD]], SD cards can be formatted using the [[Unix File System|UFS]], [[Ext2]], [[Ext3]], [[Ext4]], [[btrfs]], [[HFS Plus]], [[ReiserFS]] or [[F2FS]] file system. Additionally under Linux, [[HFS Plus]] file systems may be accessed for read/write if the \"hfsplus\" package is installed, and partitioned and formatted if \"hfsprogs\" is installed. (These package names are correct under Debian, Ubuntu etc., but may differ on other Linux distributions.)\n\nAny recent version of the above can format SD cards using the [[Universal Disk Format|UDF]] file system.\n\nAdditionally, as with [[live USB]] flash drives, an SD card can have an operating system installed on it. Computers that can [[booting|boot]] from an SD card (either using a USB adapter or inserted into the computer's flash media reader) instead of the hard disk drive may thereby be able to recover from a corrupted hard disk drive.<ref>Any operating system used on [[Raspberry Pi]] generally have to boot off a Live SD, most commonly Raspbian.</ref> Such an SD card can be [[#Card security|write-locked]] to preserve the system's integrity.\n\nThe SD Standard allows usage of only the above-mentioned Microsoft FAT file systems and any card produced in the market shall be preloaded with the related standard file system upon its delivery to the market. If any application or user re-formats the card with a non-standard file system the proper operation of the card, including interoperability, cannot be assured.\n\n====Risks of reformatting====\nReformatting an SD card with a different file system, or even with the same one, may make the card slower, or shorten its lifespan. Some cards use [[wear leveling]], in which frequently modified blocks are mapped to different portions of memory at different times, and some wear-leveling algorithms are designed for the access patterns typical of FAT12, FAT16 or FAT32.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lwn.net/Articles/428584/ |title=Optimizing Linux with cheap flash drives |publisher=Linux Weekly News|accessdate=2011-04-11}}</ref> In addition, the preformatted file system may use a cluster size that matches the erase region of the physical memory on the card; reformatting may change the cluster size and make writes less efficient.  The SD Association provides freely-downloadable SD Formatter software to overcome these problems for Windows and Mac OS X.<ref name=sdfmt>[https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_3/ SD Formatter 3.1 for SD/SDHC/SDXC], SD Association</ref>\n\nSD/SDHC/SDXC memory cards have a \"Protected Area\" on the card for the SD standard's security function.  Neither standard formatters nor the SD Association formatter will erase it.  The SD Association suggests that devices or software which use the SD security function may format it.<ref name=sdfmt/>\n\n===Power consumption===\nThe power consumption of SD cards varies by its speed mode, manufacturer and model.\n\nDuring transfer it may be in the range of 66\u2013330&nbsp;mW (20\u2013100&nbsp;mA at a supply voltage of 3.3&nbsp;V). Specifications from TwinMos technologies list a maximum of 149&nbsp;mW (45&nbsp;mA) during transfer. Toshiba lists 264\u2013330&nbsp;mW (80\u2013100&nbsp;mA).<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.toshiba-memory.com/en/micro_sd_cards.html | contribution = microSD & microSDHC Cards | publisher = Toshiba | title = Memory Solutions}}</ref> Standby current is much lower, less than 0.2&nbsp;mA for one 2006 microSD card.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.dtt8.com/images/micro-sd%20specification.pdf | publisher = DTT | title = Micro SD specification | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130207004550/http://www.dtt8.com/images/micro-sd%20specification.pdf | archive-date = 2013-02-07 | df =  }}</ref> If there is data transfer for significant periods, battery life may be reduced noticeably (smartphones typically have batteries of capacity around 6&nbsp;Wh (Samsung Galaxy S2, 1650&nbsp;mAh @ 3.7&nbsp;V)).\n\nModern UHS-II cards can consume up to 2.88&nbsp;W, if the host device supports bus speed mode SDR104 or UHS-II.

The resulting cards do not work correctly in some host devices.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.hjreggel.net/cardspeed/special-sd.html | contribution = SD Compatibility | title = Card speed \u2013 Card Readers and Memory Cards | date = December 1, 2006 | publisher = HJ Reggel}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.eggheadcafe.com/software/aspnet/33338344/winxp-sp3-cant-read-4gb.aspx |title=WinXP SP3 cannot read 4GB SD card in multicard reader |publisher=Egg head cafe | accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref>\n\n===SDSC cards above 1 GB===\n[[File:Sd4gy crop.jpg|thumb|4&nbsp;GB SDSC card]]\n\nA host device can ask any inserted SD card for its 128-bit identification string (the Card-Specific Data or CSD). In standard-capacity cards (SDSC), 12 bits identify the number of memory clusters (ranging from 1 to 4,096) and 3 bits identify the number of blocks per cluster (which decode to 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, or 512 blocks per cluster). The host device multiplies these figures (as shown in the following section) with the number of bytes per block to determine the card's capacity in bytes.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nSD version 1.00 assumed 512 bytes per block. This permitted SDSC cards up to 4,096 \u00d7 512 \u00d7 512 B = 1&nbsp;GiB, for which there are no known incompatibilities.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nVersion 1.01 let an SDSC card use a 4-bit field to indicate 1,024 or 2,048 bytes per block instead.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" /> Doing so enabled cards with 2&nbsp;GB and 4&nbsp;GB capacity, such as the Transcend 4&nbsp;GB SD card and the Memorette 4 GB SD card.\n\nEarly SDSC host devices that assume 512-byte blocks therefore do not fully support the insertion of 2&nbsp;GB or 4&nbsp;GB cards. In some cases, the host device can read data that happens to reside in the first 1&nbsp;GB of the card. If the assumption is made in the driver software, success may be version-dependent. In addition, any host device might not support a 4&nbsp;GB SDSC card, since the specification lets it assume that 2&nbsp;GB is the maximum for these cards.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Storage capacity calculations===\nThe format of the Card-Specific Data (CSD) register changed between version 1 (SDSC) and version 2.0 (which defines SDHC and SDXC).\n\n====Version 1====\nIn version 1 of the SD specification, capacities up to 2&nbsp;GB are calculated by combining fields of the CSD as follows:\n\n Capacity = ('''C_SIZE''' + 1) \u00d7 2<sup>('''C_SIZE_MULT''' + '''READ_BL_LEN''' + 2)</sup>\n where\n   0 \u2264 '''C_SIZE''' \u2264 4095,\n   0 \u2264 '''C_SIZE_MULT''' \u2264 7,\n   '''READ_BL_LEN''' is 9 (for 512 bytes/sector) or 10 (for 1024 bytes/sector)\n\nLater versions state (at Section 4.3.2) that a 2&nbsp;GB SDSC card shall set its READ_BL_LEN (and WRITE_BL_LEN) to indicate 1024 bytes, so that the above computation correctly reports the card's capacity; but that, for consistency, the host device shall not request (by CMD16) block lengths over 512 B.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" />\n\n====Versions 2 and 3====\nIn the definition of SDHC cards in version 2.0, the C_SIZE portion of the CSD is 22 bits and it indicates the memory size in multiples of 512&nbsp;KiB (the C_SIZE_MULT field is removed and READ_BL_LEN is no longer used to compute capacity). Two bits that were formerly reserved now identify the card family: 0 is SDSC; 1 is SDHC or SDXC; 2 and 3 are reserved.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" /> Because of these redefinitions, older host devices do not correctly identify SDHC or SDXC cards nor their correct capacity.\n\n* SDHC cards are restricted to reporting a capacity not over 32&nbsp;GB.\n* SDXC cards are allowed to use all 22 bits of the C_SIZE field. An SDHC card that did so (reported C_SIZE > 65375 to indicate a capacity of over 32&nbsp;GB) would violate the specification. A host device that relied on C_SIZE rather than the specification to determine the card's maximum capacity might support such a card, but the card might fail in other SDHC-compatible host devices.\n\nCapacity is calculated thus:\n\n Capacity = ('''C_SIZE''' + 1) \u00d7 524288\n where for SDHC  \n   4112 \u2264 '''C_SIZE''' \u2264 65375  \n   \u22482&nbsp;GB \u2264 Capacity \u2264 \u224832&nbsp;GB\n where for SDXC \n   65535 \u2264 '''C_SIZE'''\n   \u224832&nbsp;GB \u2264 Capacity \u2264 2&nbsp;TB\n\nCapacities above 4&nbsp;GB can only be achieved by following version 2.0 or later versions. In addition, capacities equal to 4&nbsp;GB must also do so to guarantee compatibility.\n\n==Openness of specification==\n[[File:SD-microSD adaptor.jpg|thumb|upright|Dismantled microSD to SD adapter showing the passive connection from the microSD card slot on the bottom to the SD pins on the top]]\n\nLike most memory card formats, SD is covered by numerous [[patent]]s and [[trademark]]s. Excluding [[Secure Digital#SDIO cards|SDIO]] cards, [[Royalty payment|royalties]] for SD card licenses are imposed for manufacture and sale of memory cards and host adapters (US$1,000/year plus membership at US$1,500/year)\n\nEarly versions of the SD specification were available under a [[non-disclosure agreement]] (NDA) prohibiting development of [[open-source software|open-source]] drivers. However, the system was eventually [[reverse-engineered]] and free software drivers provided access to SD cards not using DRM. Subsequent to the release of most open-source drivers, the SDA provided a simplified version of the specification under a less restrictive license helping reduce some incompatibility issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linux.com/archive/feed/20060 |title=Sharp Linux PDA promotes the use of proprietary SD card, but more open MMC works just fine |publisher=Linux.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref>\n\nUnder a disclaimers agreement, the simplified specification released by the SDA in 2006 \u2013 as opposed to that of SD cards \u2013 which later extended to the physical layer, ASSD extensions, SDIO, and SDIO [[Bluetooth]] Type-A.<ref>[http://www.sdcard.org/developers/tech/sdcard/pls/ Simplified Specification Agreement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028165644/http://www.sdcard.org/developers/tech/sdcard/pls/ |date=2008-10-28 }} from the SDA's website</ref> Again, most of the information had already been discovered and [[Linux]] had a fully free driver for it. Still, building a chip conforming to this specification caused the [[One Laptop per Child]] project to claim \"the first truly Open Source SD implementation, with no need to obtain an SDI license or sign NDAs to create SD drivers or applications.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mailman.laptop.org/pipermail/community-news/2006-September/000023.html |title=OLPC mailing list archive |publisher=Mailman.laptop.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110412094819/http://mailman.laptop.org/pipermail/community-news/2006-September/000023.html|archivedate=2011-04-12}}</ref>\n\nThe proprietary nature of the complete SD specification affects [[embedded system]]s, laptop computers, and some desktop computers; many desktop computers do not have card slots, instead using [[USB]]-based [[card reader#Memory card readers|card readers]] if necessary. These card readers present a standard [[USB mass storage]] interface to memory cards, thus separating the operating system from the details of the underlying SD interface. However, embedded systems (such as portable music players) usually gain direct access to SD cards and thus need complete programming information. Desktop card readers are themselves embedded systems; their manufacturers have usually paid the SDA for complete access to the SD specifications. Many notebook computers now include SD card readers not based on USB; device drivers for these essentially gain direct access to the SD card, as do embedded systems.\n\nThe [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus|SPI]]-bus interface mode is the only type that does not require a host license for accessing SD cards.\n\n==Comparison to other flash memory formats==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\n[[File:Flash memory cards size.jpg|thumb|upright|Size comparison of various flash cards: SD, [[CompactFlash]], [[MultiMediaCard|MMC]], [[xD-Picture Card|xD]]]]\n\nOverall, SD is less open than [[CompactFlash]] or [[USB flash drive|USB flash memory drives]]. Those [[open standard]]s can be implemented without paying for licensing, royalties, or documentation. (CompactFlash and USB flash drives may require licensing fees for the use of the SDA's trademarked logos.)\n\nHowever, SD is much more open than [[Memory Stick|Sony's Memory Stick]], for which no public documentation nor any documented legacy implementation is available. All SD cards can be accessed freely using the well-documented [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus|SPI]] bus.\n\n[[xD-Picture Card|xD]] cards are simply 18-pin [[NAND flash]] chips in a special package and support [[XD-Picture Card#Raw hardware|the standard command set]] for raw NAND flash access. Although the raw hardware interface to xD cards is well understood, the layout of its memory contents\u2014necessary for interoperability with xD card readers and digital cameras\u2014is totally undocumented. The consortium that licenses xD cards has not released any technical information to the public.\n\n{{Comparison of memory cards}}\n\n==Data recovery==\nA malfunctioning SD card can be repaired using specialized equipment, as long as the middle part, containing the flash storage, is not physically damaged.

Secure Digital changed the MMC design in several ways:\n\n* Asymmetrical shape of the sides of the SD card prevent inserting it upside down (while an MMC goes in most of the way but makes no contact if inverted).\n* Most SD cards are {{convert|2.1|mm|abbr=in}} thick, compared to {{convert|1.4|mm|abbr=in}} for MMCs.

Both read and write speeds must exceed the specified value. The specification defines these classes in terms of performance curves that translate into the following minimum read-write performance levels on an empty card and suitability for different applications:<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" /><ref name=\"sda_speed_class\"/><ref name=\"sda_speed_class_consumer\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sdcard.org/consumers/choices/speed_class/index.html|title=Speed Class Standards for Video Recording - SD Association|website=www.sdcard.org}}</ref><ref name=\"sda_logos_2017\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sdcard.org/consumers/pdf/2017SDA_brochure_eng.pdf|title=SD Standards Brochure 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe SD Association defines three types of Speed Class ratings: the original Speed Class, UHS Speed Class, and Video Speed Class.\n\n===== Speed Class =====\n'''Speed Class''' ratings 2, 4, and 6 assert that the card supports the respective number of megabytes per second as a minimum sustained write speed for a card in a fragmented state. Class 10 asserts that the card supports 10&nbsp;MB/s as a minimum non-fragmented sequential write speed and uses a High Speed bus mode.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" /> The host device can read a card's speed class and warn the user if the card reports a speed class that falls below an application's minimum need.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" /> By comparison, the older \"\u00d7\" rating measured maximum speed under ideal conditions, and was vague as to whether this was read speed or write speed. The graphical symbol for the speed class has a number encircled with 'C' (C2, C4, C6, and C10).\n\n===== UHS Speed Class =====\nUHS-I and UHS-II cards can use '''UHS Speed Class''' rating with two possible grades: class 1 for minimum read/write performance of at least 10&nbsp;MB/s ('U1' symbol featuring number 1 inside 'U') and class 3 for minimum write performance of 30&nbsp;MB/s ('U3' symbol featuring 3 inside 'U'), targeted at recording [[4K video]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sdcard.org/home/New_SDXC_and_SDHC_Memory_Cards_Now_Support_4K2K_Video_11-6-2013_FINAL_2.pdf |title=NEW SDXC AND SDHC MEMORY CARDS SUPPORT 4K2K VIDEO |publisher=SD Association |date= |accessdate=2013-11-13}}</ref> Before November 2013, the rating was branded ''UHS Speed Grade'' and contained grades 0 (no symbol) and 1 ('U1' symbol). Manufacturers can also display standard speed class symbols (C2, C4, C6, and C10) alongside, or in place of UHS speed class.\n\nUHS memory cards work best with UHS host devices. The combination lets the user record HD resolution videos with [[tapeless camcorder]]s while performing other functions. It is also suitable for real-time broadcasts and capturing large HD videos.\n\n===== Video Speed Class =====\n'''Video Speed Class''' defines a set of requirements for UHS cards to match the modern [[Multi-level cell|MLC NAND flash]] memory<ref name=\"sd50_video_speed\"/> and supports progressive 4K and 8K video with minimum sequential writing speeds of 6-90&nbsp;MB/s.<ref name=\"sda_video_speed\"/><ref name=\"sda_speed_class\"/><ref name=\"sda_speed_class_consumer\"/> The graphical symbols use 'V' followed by a number designating write speed (V6, V10, V30, V60, and V90).\n\n===== Comparison =====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Comparison of SD card Speed Class ratings<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sdcard.org/developers/overview/speed_class/index.html|title=Speed Class - SD Association|website=www.sdcard.org|accessdate=2019-02-15}}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Minimum sequential writing speed\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | Speed Class\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"4\" | [[Video format]]{{Efn|The necessary recording and playback speed class requirements may vary by device.}}\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Speed Class\n! scope=\"col\" | UHS Speed Class\n! scope=\"col\" | Video Speed Class \n! scope=\"col\" | [[Standard-definition television|SD]]\n! scope=\"col\" | [[High-definition video|HD]]/[[Full HD]]\n! scope=\"col\" | [[4K resolution|4K]]\n! scope=\"col\" | [[8K resolution|8K]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{nowrap|2 [[MB/s]]}}\n| {{nowrap|[[File:SDHC Speed Class 2.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 2 (C2)}}\n| {{N/a}} \n| {{N/a}} \n| rowspan=\"7\" {{Yes}}\n| {{No}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" {{No}}\n| rowspan=\"4\" {{No}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{nowrap|4 MB/s}}\n| {{nowrap|[[File:SDHC Speed Class 4.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 4 (C4)}}\n| {{N/a}} \n| {{N/a}}  \n| rowspan=\"6\" {{Yes}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{nowrap|6 MB/s}}\n| {{nowrap|[[File:SDHC Speed Class 6.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 6 (C6)}}\n| {{N/a}} \n| {{nowrap|[[File:SD Video Speed Class 6.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 6 (V6)}}\n| rowspan=\"5\" {{Yes}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{nowrap|10 MB/s}}\n| {{nowrap|[[File:SD Class 10.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 10 (C10)}}\n| {{nowrap|[[File:SD UHS Speed Class 1.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 1 (U1)}}\n| {{nowrap|[[File:SD Video Speed Class 10.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 10 (V10)}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{nowrap|30 MB/s}}\n| {{N/a}} \n| {{nowrap|[[File:SD UHS Speed Class 3.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 3 (U3)}}\n| {{nowrap|[[File:SD Video Speed Class 30.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 30 (V30)}}\n| rowspan=\"3\" {{Yes}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{nowrap|60 MB/s}}\n| {{N/a}} \n| {{N/a}} \n| {{nowrap|[[File:SD Video Speed Class 60.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 60 (V60)}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{nowrap|90 MB/s}}\n| {{N/a}} \n| {{N/a}} \n| {{nowrap|[[File:SD Video Speed Class 90.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 90 (V90)}}\n|}\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==== Application Performance Class ====\n''Application Performance Class'' is a newly defined standard from the SD Specification 5.1 and 6.0 which not only define sequential Reading Speeds but also mandates a minimum [[IOPS]] for reading and writing.

Basic cards transfer data at up to six times (6\u00d7) the CD-ROM speed; that is, 900&nbsp;KiB/s or 7.37&nbsp;Mbit/s. The 2.0 specification{{clarify|reason=which specification|date=September 2013}} defines speeds up to 200\u00d7, but is not as specific as Speed Classes are on how to measure speed. Manufacturers may report best-case speeds and may report the card's fastest read speed, which is typically faster than the write speed. Some vendors, including [[Transcend Information|Transcend]] and [[Kingston Technology|Kingston]], report their cards' write speed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kingston.com/us/flash/x-speed |title=Flash Memory Cards and X-Speed Ratings |website=Kingston |accessdate=2017-08-05 }}</ref> When a card lists both a speed class and an \"\u00d7\" rating, the latter may be assumed a read speed only.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Real-world performance===\nIn applications that require sustained write throughput, such as video recording, the device might not perform satisfactorily if the SD card's class rating falls below a particular speed. For example, a high-definition [[camcorder]] may require a card of not less than Class 6, suffering dropouts or corrupted video if a slower card is used. [[Digital camera]]s with slow cards may take a noticeable time after taking a photograph before being ready for the next, while the camera writes the first picture.\n\nThe speed class rating does not totally characterize card performance. Different cards of the same class may vary considerably while meeting class specifications. A card's speed depends on many factors, including:\n* The frequency of soft errors that the card's controller must re-try\n* [[Write amplification]]: The flash controller may need to overwrite more data than requested. This has to do with performing read-modify-write operations on write blocks, freeing up (the much larger) erase blocks, while moving data around to achieve [[wear leveling]].\n* [[File fragmentation]]: where there is not sufficient space for a file to be recorded in a contiguous region, it is split into non-contiguous fragments. This does not cause rotational or head-movement delays as with electromechanical [[hard drive]]s, but may decrease speed\u2060\u200a\u2060\u200a\u2060\u2015\u200a\u200afor instance, by requiring additional reads and computation to determine where on the card the file's next fragment is stored.\n\nIn addition, speed may vary markedly between writing a large amount of data to a single file ([[sequential access]], as when a [[digital camera]] records large photographs or videos) and writing a large number of small files (a [[random access|random-access]] use common in [[smartphone]]s). A study in 2012 found that, in this random-access use, some Class 2 cards achieved a write speed of 1.38&nbsp;[[MB/s]], while all cards tested of Class 6 or greater (and some of lower Classes; lower Class does not ''necessarily'' mean better small-file performance), including those from major manufacturers, were over 100 times slower.<ref name=necstudy/> In 2014, a blogger measured a 300-fold performance difference on small writes; this time, the best card in this category was a class 4 card.<ref name=Gough2014/>\n\n==Features==\n\n===Card security===\nCards can protect their contents from erasure or modification, prevent access by non-authorized users, and protect copyrighted content using digital rights management.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n====Commands to disable writes====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\nThe host device can command the SD card to become read-only (to reject subsequent commands to write information to it). There are both reversible and irreversible host commands that achieve this.\n\n====Write-protect notch====\n[[File:SD card unlocked and locked.svg|thumb|Unlocked and locked SD cards]]\n[[File:Sony toughcard notch less design.jpg|thumb|Sony 128GB SF-G Tough Series UHS-II SDXC Memory Card is one of the few cards in the market without a sliding tab on the write protect notch.]]\n\nMost full-size SD cards have a \"mechanical write protect switch\" allowing the user to advise the host computer that the user wants the device to be treated as read-only. This does not protect the data on the card if the host is compromised: ''\"It is the responsibility of the host to protect the card. The position of the write protect switch is unknown to the internal circuitry of the card.\"''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/pls/index.html|title=Simplified Specifications - SD Association, version 3.10 , Part 1, Physical Layer, section 4.3.6\" Write Protect Management\"|last=|first=|date=|website=www.sdcard.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|accessdate=2019-04-11}}</ref> Some host devices do not support write protection, which is an optional feature of the SD specification, and drivers and devices that do obey a read-only indication may give the user a way to override it.\n\nThe switch is a sliding tab that covers a notch in the card. The miniSD and microSD formats do not directly support a write protection notch, but they can be inserted into full-size adapters which do.\n\nWhen looking at the SD card from the top, the right side (the side with the beveled corner) must be notched.\n\nOn the left side, there may be a write-protection notch. If the notch is omitted, the card can be read and written. If the card is notched, it is read-only. If the card has a notch and a sliding tab which covers the notch, the user can slide the tab upward (toward the contacts) to declare the card read/write, or downward to declare it read-only. The diagram to the right shows an orange sliding write-protect tab in both the unlocked and locked positions.\n\nCards sold with content that must not be altered are permanently marked read-only by having a notch and no sliding tab.\n\n====Card password====\n[[File:Sdadaptersandcards.jpg|thumb|MicroSD to SD adapter (left), microSD to miniSD adapter (middle), microSD card (right)]]\n\nA host device can lock an SD card using a password of up to 16&nbsp;bytes, typically supplied by the user. A locked card interacts normally with the host device except that it rejects commands to read and write data. A locked card can be unlocked only by providing the same password. The host device can, after supplying the old password, specify a new password or disable locking. Without the password (typically, in the case that the user forgets the password), the host device can command the card to erase all the data on the card for future re-use (except card data under DRM), but there is no way to gain access to the existing data.\n\n[[Windows Phone 7]] devices use SD cards designed for access only by the phone manufacturer or mobile provider. An SD card inserted into the phone underneath the battery compartment becomes locked \"to the phone with an automatically generated key\" so that \"the SD card cannot be read by another phone, device, or PC\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2450831|title=Windows Phone 7 Secure Digital Card Limitations}}</ref> [[Symbian OS|Symbian]] devices, however, are some of the few that can perform the necessary low-level format operations on locked SD cards.

SDIO cards are only fully functional in host devices designed to support their input-output functions (typically PDAs like the [[Palm Treo]], but occasionally laptops or mobile phones). These devices can use the SD slot to support [[GPS]] receivers, [[modem]]s, [[barcode reader]]s, [[FM radio]] tuners, TV tuners, [[RFID]] readers, [[digital camera]]s, and interfaces to [[Wi-Fi]], [[Bluetooth]], [[Ethernet]], and [[Infrared Data Association|IrDA]]. Many other SDIO devices have been proposed, but it is now more common for I/O devices to connect using the USB interface.\n\nSDIO cards support most of the memory commands of SD cards. SDIO cards can be structured as eight logical cards, although currently, the typical way that an SDIO card uses this capability is to structure itself as one I/O card and one memory card.\n\nThe SDIO and SD interfaces are mechanically and electrically identical. Host devices built for SDIO cards generally accept SD memory cards without I/O functions. However, the reverse is not true, because host devices need suitable drivers and applications to support the card's I/O functions. For example, an HP SDIO camera usually does not work with PDAs that do not list it as an accessory. Inserting an SDIO card into any SD slot causes no physical damage nor disruption to the host device, but users may be frustrated that the SDIO card does not function fully when inserted into a seemingly compatible slot. (USB and Bluetooth devices exhibit comparable compatibility issues, although to a lesser extent thanks to standardized [[Class driver|USB device classes]] and [[Bluetooth profiles]].)\n\nThe [[#SDIO|SDIO]] family comprises Low-Speed and Full-Speed cards. Both types of SDIO cards support SPI and one-bit SD bus types. Low-Speed SDIO cards are allowed to also support the four-bit SD bus; Full-Speed SDIO cards are required to support the four-bit SD bus. To use an SDIO card as a \"combo card\" (for both memory and I/O), the host device must first select four-bit SD bus operation. Two other unique features of Low-Speed SDIO are a maximum clock rate of 400&nbsp;kHz for all communications, and the use of Pin 8 as \"interrupt\" to try to initiate dialogue with the host device.<ref name=\"SDIOspec\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sdcard.org/developers/overview/sdio/sdio_spec/|title=Simplified Version of SDIO CARD SPEC|publisher=SD Association|accessdate=2011-12-09}}</ref>\n\n; Ganging cards together\nThe one-bit SD protocol was derived from the MMC protocol, which envisioned the ability to put up to three cards on a bus of common signal lines. The cards use [[open collector]] interfaces, where a card may pull a line to the low voltage level; the line is at the high voltage level (because of a [[pull-up resistor]]) if no card pulls it low. Though the cards shared clock and signal lines, each card had its own [[chip select]] line to sense that the host device had selected it.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe SD protocol envisioned the ability to gang 30 cards together without separate chip select lines. The host device would broadcast commands to all cards and identify the card to respond to the command using its unique serial number.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nIn practice, cards are rarely ganged together because open-collector operation has problems at high speeds and increases power consumption. Newer versions of the SD specification recommend separate lines to each card.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Compatibility===\nHost devices that comply with newer versions of the specification provide [[backward compatibility]] and accept older SD cards.<ref name=\"sdcard.org\"/> For example, SDXC host devices accept all previous families of SD memory cards, and SDHC host devices also accept standard SD cards.\n\nOlder host devices generally do not support newer card formats, and even when they might support the bus interface used by the card,<ref name=sdcard_using_sdxc /> there are several factors that arise:\n\n* A newer card may offer [[#Types of cards|greater capacity]] than the host device can handle (over 4 GB for SDHC, over 32 GB for SDXC).\n* A newer card may use a [[#File system|file system]] the host device cannot navigate ([[FAT32]] for SDHC, [[exFAT]] for SDXC)\n* Use of an SDIO card requires the host device be designed for the input/output functions the card provides.\n* The hardware interface of the card was changed starting with the version 2.0 (new high-speed bus clocks, redefinition of [[#Storage capacity calculations|storage capacity bits]]) and [[#SDHC|SDHC]] family (Ultra-high speed (UHS) bus)\n* UHS-II has physically more pins but is backwards compatible to UHS-I and non-UHS for both slot and card.<ref name=\"sda_bus_speed\"/>\n* Some vendors produced SDSC cards above&nbsp;1GB before the SDA had standardized a method of doing so.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ SD compatibility table\n! {{Diagonal split header|Slot|Card}}\n! scope=\"col\" | SDSC\n! scope=\"col\" | SDHC\n! scope=\"col\" | SDHC<br/>UHS\n! scope=\"col\" | SDXC\n! scope=\"col\" | SDXC<br/>UHS \n! scope=\"col\" | SDIO\n|- \n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDSC\n| {{Partial}}{{Efn|name=sdsccompat|See [[#Storage_capacity_and_compatibilities|discussion about storage capacity and compatibilities]]}} || {{Partial|FAT16,<4GiB}}{{Efn|name=sdsccompat}} || {{Partial|FAT16,<4GiB}}{{Efn|name=sdsccompat}} || {{No}} || {{No}} || {{No}}\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDHC\n| {{Yes}} || {{Yes}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs|In non-UHS mode}}}} || {{Partial|FAT32}} || {{Partial|FAT32{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}}  || {{No}}\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDHC UHS\n| {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} ||  {{Yes|Yes{{Efn|name=uhs|In UHS mode}}}} || {{Partial|FAT32{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} || {{Partial|FAT32{{Efn|name=uhs}}}} ||  {{No}}\n|- \n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDXC\n| {{Yes}} || {{Yes}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} || {{Yes}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}}  || {{No}}\n|- \n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDXC UHS\n| {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} ||  {{Yes|Yes{{Efn|name=uhs}}}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}}|| {{Yes|Yes{{Efn|name=uhs}}}} || {{No}}\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDIO\n| {{partial|Varies}} ||  {{partial|Varies}} || {{partial|Varies}} || {{partial|Varies}} || {{partial|Varies}} || {{Yes}}\n|}\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==Markets==\nSecure Digital cards are used in many consumer electronic devices, and have become a widespread means of storing several gigabytes of data in a small size.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Devices in which the user may remove and replace cards often, such as [[digital camera]]s, [[camcorder]]s, and [[video game console]]s, tend to use full-sized cards.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Devices in which small size is paramount, such as [[mobile phone]]s, tend to use microSD cards.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe microSD card has helped propel the smartphone market by giving both manufacturers and consumers greater flexibility and freedom.{{According to whom|date=October 2016}} Due to their compact size, microSD cards are used in many{{Which|date=October 2016}} different applications in a large variety{{Which|date=October 2016}} of markets.

The files that were copied back can be tested either by comparing checksums (e.g. [[Md5sum|MD5]]), or trying to [[Data compression|compress]] them. The latter approach leverages the fact that counterfeited cards let the user read back files, which then consist of easily compressible uniform data (for example, repeating [[0xFF]]s).\n\n===Digital cameras===\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2016}}\nSD/MMC cards replaced [[Toshiba]]'s [[SmartMedia]] as the dominant memory card format used in digital cameras. In 2001, SmartMedia had achieved nearly 50% use, but by 2005 SD/MMC had achieved over 40% of the digital camera market and SmartMedia's share had plummeted by 2007.\n\nAt this time, all the leading digital camera manufacturers used SD in their consumer product lines, including [[Canon Inc.|Canon]], [[Casio]], [[Fujifilm]], [[Kodak]], [[Leica Camera|Leica]], [[Nikon]], [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]], [[Panasonic]], [[Pentax]], [[Ricoh]], [[Samsung]], and [[Sony]]. Formerly, [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]] and [[Fujifilm]] used [[XD-Picture Card]]s (xD cards) exclusively, while [[Sony]] only used [[Memory Stick]]; by early 2010 all three supported SD.\n\nSome [[prosumer]] and professional digital cameras continued to offer [[CompactFlash]] (CF), either on a second card slot or as the only storage, as CF supports much higher maximum capacities and historically was cheaper for the same capacity.\n\nSecure Digital memory cards can be used in Sony [[XDCAM]] EX [[camcorder]]s with an adapter<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pro.sony.com/bbsc/ssr/micro-xdcamexsite/cat-accessories/product-MEADSD01/ |title=MEAD-SD01 SDHC card adapter (Sony) |publisher=Pro.sony.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref> and in Panasonic [[P2 (storage media)|P2 card]] equipment with a [[MicroP2]] adapter.\n\n===Personal computers===\nAlthough many [[personal computer]]s accommodate SD cards as an auxiliary storage device using a built-in slot, or can accommodate SD cards by means of a USB adapter, SD cards cannot be used as the primary [[hard disk]] through the onboard [[Parallel ATA|ATA]] controller, because none of the SD card variants support ATA signalling.

However, on computers that support [[bootstrapping]] from a USB interface, an SD card in a USB adapter can be the primary hard disk, provided it contains an operating system that supports USB access once the bootstrap is complete.\n\nSince late 2009, newer [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] computers with installed SD card readers have been able to boot in [[macOS]] from SD storage devices, when properly formatted to [[HFS Plus|Mac OS Extended]] file format and the default partition table set to [[GUID Partition Table]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3553 |title=About the SD and SDXC card slot |publisher=Support.apple.com |date=2013-06-08 |accessdate=2013-11-13}}</ref> (See [[#File system|Other file systems]] below).\n\nSD cards are increasing in usage and popular among owners of vintage computers like [[Atari 8-bit family|8-bit Atari]]. For example SIO2SD ([[Atari SIO|SIO]] is an Atari port for connecting external devices) is used nowadays. It may be an interesting fact that the whole collection of software for an 8-bit Atari may be included on one SD card that may have less than 4-8 GB of disk size (2019).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://retrohax.net/sio2sd-for-atari/|title=SIO2SD for 8-bit Atari|date=May 9, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Embedded systems===\n[[File:Arduino Ethernet Shield (pre-production sample).jpg|thumb|A shield ([[daughterboard]]) that gives [[Arduino]] prototyping microprocessors access to SD cards]]\n\nIn 2008, the SDA specified Embedded SD, \"leverag[ing] well-known SD standards\" to enable non-removable SD-style devices on printed circuit boards.<ref>{{cite web|title=Embedded SD|publisher=SD Association|url=http://www.sdcard.org/developers/overview/embedded_sd/|accessdate=2011-11-30}}</ref> However this standard was not adopted by the market while the [[MultiMediaCard|MMC]] standard became the de facto standard for embedded systems.

The SPI bus mode and one-bit SD bus mode are mandatory for all SD families, as explained in the next section. Once the host device and the SD card negotiate a bus interface mode, the usage of the numbered pins is the same for all card sizes.\n* '''SPI bus mode:''' [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus]] is primarily used by embedded [[microcontroller]]s. This bus type supports only a 3.3-volt interface. This is the only bus type that does not require a host license.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n* '''One-bit SD bus mode:''' Separate command and data channels and a proprietary transfer format.\n* '''Four-bit SD bus mode:''' Uses extra pins plus some reassigned pins. This is the same protocol as the one-bit SD bus mode which uses one command and four data lines for faster data transfer. All SD cards support this mode. UHS-I and UHS-II require this bus type.\n* '''Two differential lines SD UHS-II mode:''' Uses two low-voltage differential interfaces to transfer commands and data. UHS-II cards include this interface in addition to the SD bus modes.\n\nThe physical interface comprises 9 pins, except that the miniSD card adds two unconnected pins in the center and the microSD card omits one of the two V<sub>SS</sub> (Ground) pins.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/pls/simplified_specs/part1_410.pdf |title=SD Part 1, Physical Layer Simplified Specification, Version 4.10 |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202232415/https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/pls/simplified_specs/part1_410.pdf |archive-date=2013-12-02 |df= }}</ref>\n\n[[File:MMC-SD-miniSD-microSD-Color-Numbers-Names.gif|thumb|upright|Official pin numbers for each card type (top to bottom): [[MultiMediaCard|MMC]], SD, miniSD, microSD.

The host device thereby sends 48-bit commands and receives responses. The card can signal that a response will be delayed, but the host device can abort the dialogue.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\"/>\n\nThrough issuing various commands, the host device can:<ref name=\"SDHCspec\"/>\n* Determine the type, memory capacity, and capabilities of the SD card\n* Command the card to use a different voltage, different clock speed, or advanced electrical interface\n* Prepare the card to receive a block to write to the flash memory, or read and reply with the contents of a specified block.\n\nThe command interface is an extension of the [[MultiMediaCard]] (MMC) interface. SD cards dropped support for some of the commands in the MMC protocol, but added commands related to copy protection. By using only commands supported by both standards until determining the type of card inserted, a host device can accommodate both SD and MMC cards.\n\n====Electrical interface====\nAll SD card families initially use a 3.3&nbsp;[[volt]] electrical interface. On command, SDHC and SDXC cards can switch to 1.8&nbsp;V operation.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" />\n\nAt initial power-up or card insertion, the host device selects either the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) bus or the one-bit SD bus by the voltage level present on Pin 1. Thereafter, the host device may issue a command to switch to the four-bit SD bus interface, if the SD card supports it. For various card types, support for the four-bit SD bus is either optional or mandatory.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" />\n\nAfter determining that the SD card supports it, the host device can also command the SD card to switch to a [[#Speed|higher transfer speed]]. Until determining the card's capabilities, the host device should not use a clock speed faster than 400&nbsp;kHz. SD cards other than SDIO (see below) have a \"Default Speed\" clock rate of 25&nbsp;MHz. The host device is not required to use the maximum clock speed that the card supports. It may operate at less than the maximum clock speed to conserve power.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" /> Between commands, the host device can stop the clock entirely.\n\n====Achieving higher card speeds====\nThe SD specification defines four-bit-wide transfers. (The MMC specification supports this and also defines an eight-bit-wide mode; MMC cards with extended bits were not accepted by the market.) Transferring several bits on each clock pulse improves the card speed. Advanced SD families have also improved speed by offering faster clock frequencies and double data rate (explained [[#UHS Speed Class|here]]) in a high-speed differential interface (UHS-II).{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===File system===\nLike other types of [[flash memory]] card, an SD card of any SD family is a [[block (data storage)|block-addressable]] [[Data storage device|storage device]], in which the host device can read or write fixed-size blocks by specifying their block number.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n====MBR and FAT====\nMost SD cards ship preformatted with one or more [[Master boot record|MBR partitions]], where the first or only partition contains a [[file system]]. This lets them operate like the [[hard disk]] of a [[personal computer]]. Per the SD card specification, an SD card is formatted with MBR and the following file system:\n\n* For SDSC cards:\n** Capacity of less than 32,680 logical sectors<!-- This is the exact condition as per the SD card spec.

Universal support for FAT12, FAT16, FAT16B, and FAT32 allows the use of SDSC and SDHC cards on most host computers with a compatible SD reader, to present the user with the familiar method of named files in a hierarchical directory tree.\n\nOn such SD cards, standard utility programs such as Mac OS X's \"{{nowrap|[[Disk Utility]]}}\" or Windows' [[SCANDISK]] can be used to repair a corrupted filing system and sometimes recover deleted files. [[Defragmentation]] tools for FAT file systems may be used on such cards. The resulting consolidation of files may provide a marginal improvement in the time required to read or write the file,<ref name=\"Fragmentation_and_Speed\">{{Citation | url = https://www.sdcard.org/developers/overview/speed_class/ | title = Fragmentation and Speed | publisher = SD Card}}</ref> but not an improvement comparable to defragmentation of hard drives, where storing a file in multiple fragments requires additional physical, and relatively slow, movement of a drive head. Moreover, defragmentation performs writes to the SD card that count against the card's rated lifespan. The write endurance of the physical memory is discussed in the article on [[Flash memory degradation|flash memory]]; newer technology to increase the storage capacity of a card provides worse write endurance.\n\nWhen reformatting an SD card with a capacity of at least 32&nbsp;MB (65536 logical sectors or more), but not more than 2&nbsp;GB, [[FAT16B]] with partition type [[Partition type#PID 06h|06h]] and [[EBPB 4.1]]<ref name=\"SDG_2000_SD-P2-V1.0\"/> is recommended if the card is for a consumer device. (FAT16B is also an option for 4&nbsp;GB cards, but it requires the use of 64&nbsp;KiB [[cluster (file system)|clusters]], which are not widely supported.) FAT16B does not support cards above 4&nbsp;GB at all.\n\nThe SDXC specification mandates the use of [[Microsoft]]'s [[proprietary format|proprietary]] [[exFAT]] file system,<ref name=\"engadget_sdxc_2t_300m\">{{cite web | url = https://www.engadget.com/2009/01/07/sdxc-memory-cards-promise-2tb-of-storage-300mbps-transfer/ |title = SDXC memory cards promise 2 TB of storage, 300 MBps transfer | publisher=Engadget |date= 2009-01-07 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref> which sometimes requires appropriate drivers (e.g. <code>exfat-utils</code>/<code>exfat-fuse</code> on Linux).\n\n====Other file systems====\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2016}}\nBecause the host views the SD card as a block storage device, the card does not require MBR partitions or any specific file system. The card can be reformatted to use any file system the operating system supports. For example:\n* Under [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], SD cards can be formatted using [[NTFS]] and, on later versions, [[exFAT]].\n* Under [[macOS]], SD cards can be partitioned as [[GUID Partition Table|GUID]] devices and formatted with either [[HFS Plus]] or [[Apple File System|APFS]] file systems or still use [[exFAT]].\n* Under [[Unix-like]] operating systems such as [[Linux]] or [[FreeBSD]], SD cards can be formatted using the [[Unix File System|UFS]], [[Ext2]], [[Ext3]], [[Ext4]], [[btrfs]], [[HFS Plus]], [[ReiserFS]] or [[F2FS]] file system. Additionally under Linux, [[HFS Plus]] file systems may be accessed for read/write if the \"hfsplus\" package is installed, and partitioned and formatted if \"hfsprogs\" is installed. (These package names are correct under Debian, Ubuntu etc., but may differ on other Linux distributions.)\n\nAny recent version of the above can format SD cards using the [[Universal Disk Format|UDF]] file system.\n\nAdditionally, as with [[live USB]] flash drives, an SD card can have an operating system installed on it. Computers that can [[booting|boot]] from an SD card (either using a USB adapter or inserted into the computer's flash media reader) instead of the hard disk drive may thereby be able to recover from a corrupted hard disk drive.<ref>Any operating system used on [[Raspberry Pi]] generally have to boot off a Live SD, most commonly Raspbian.</ref> Such an SD card can be [[#Card security|write-locked]] to preserve the system's integrity.\n\nThe SD Standard allows usage of only the above-mentioned Microsoft FAT file systems and any card produced in the market shall be preloaded with the related standard file system upon its delivery to the market. If any application or user re-formats the card with a non-standard file system the proper operation of the card, including interoperability, cannot be assured.\n\n====Risks of reformatting====\nReformatting an SD card with a different file system, or even with the same one, may make the card slower, or shorten its lifespan. Some cards use [[wear leveling]], in which frequently modified blocks are mapped to different portions of memory at different times, and some wear-leveling algorithms are designed for the access patterns typical of FAT12, FAT16 or FAT32.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lwn.net/Articles/428584/ |title=Optimizing Linux with cheap flash drives |publisher=Linux Weekly News|accessdate=2011-04-11}}</ref> In addition, the preformatted file system may use a cluster size that matches the erase region of the physical memory on the card; reformatting may change the cluster size and make writes less efficient.  The SD Association provides freely-downloadable SD Formatter software to overcome these problems for Windows and Mac OS X.<ref name=sdfmt>[https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_3/ SD Formatter 3.1 for SD/SDHC/SDXC], SD Association</ref>\n\nSD/SDHC/SDXC memory cards have a \"Protected Area\" on the card for the SD standard's security function.  Neither standard formatters nor the SD Association formatter will erase it.  The SD Association suggests that devices or software which use the SD security function may format it.<ref name=sdfmt/>\n\n===Power consumption===\nThe power consumption of SD cards varies by its speed mode, manufacturer and model.\n\nDuring transfer it may be in the range of 66\u2013330&nbsp;mW (20\u2013100&nbsp;mA at a supply voltage of 3.3&nbsp;V). Specifications from TwinMos technologies list a maximum of 149&nbsp;mW (45&nbsp;mA) during transfer. Toshiba lists 264\u2013330&nbsp;mW (80\u2013100&nbsp;mA).<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.toshiba-memory.com/en/micro_sd_cards.html | contribution = microSD & microSDHC Cards | publisher = Toshiba | title = Memory Solutions}}</ref> Standby current is much lower, less than 0.2&nbsp;mA for one 2006 microSD card.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.dtt8.com/images/micro-sd%20specification.pdf | publisher = DTT | title = Micro SD specification | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130207004550/http://www.dtt8.com/images/micro-sd%20specification.pdf | archive-date = 2013-02-07 | df =  }}</ref> If there is data transfer for significant periods, battery life may be reduced noticeably (smartphones typically have batteries of capacity around 6&nbsp;Wh (Samsung Galaxy S2, 1650&nbsp;mAh @ 3.7&nbsp;V)).\n\nModern UHS-II cards can consume up to 2.88&nbsp;W, if the host device supports bus speed mode SDR104 or UHS-II.

The resulting cards do not work correctly in some host devices.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.hjreggel.net/cardspeed/special-sd.html | contribution = SD Compatibility | title = Card speed \u2013 Card Readers and Memory Cards | date = December 1, 2006 | publisher = HJ Reggel}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.eggheadcafe.com/software/aspnet/33338344/winxp-sp3-cant-read-4gb.aspx |title=WinXP SP3 cannot read 4GB SD card in multicard reader |publisher=Egg head cafe | accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref>\n\n===SDSC cards above 1 GB===\n[[File:Sd4gy crop.jpg|thumb|4&nbsp;GB SDSC card]]\n\nA host device can ask any inserted SD card for its 128-bit identification string (the Card-Specific Data or CSD). In standard-capacity cards (SDSC), 12 bits identify the number of memory clusters (ranging from 1 to 4,096) and 3 bits identify the number of blocks per cluster (which decode to 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, or 512 blocks per cluster). The host device multiplies these figures (as shown in the following section) with the number of bytes per block to determine the card's capacity in bytes.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nSD version 1.00 assumed 512 bytes per block. This permitted SDSC cards up to 4,096 \u00d7 512 \u00d7 512 B = 1&nbsp;GiB, for which there are no known incompatibilities.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nVersion 1.01 let an SDSC card use a 4-bit field to indicate 1,024 or 2,048 bytes per block instead.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" /> Doing so enabled cards with 2&nbsp;GB and 4&nbsp;GB capacity, such as the Transcend 4&nbsp;GB SD card and the Memorette 4 GB SD card.\n\nEarly SDSC host devices that assume 512-byte blocks therefore do not fully support the insertion of 2&nbsp;GB or 4&nbsp;GB cards. In some cases, the host device can read data that happens to reside in the first 1&nbsp;GB of the card. If the assumption is made in the driver software, success may be version-dependent. In addition, any host device might not support a 4&nbsp;GB SDSC card, since the specification lets it assume that 2&nbsp;GB is the maximum for these cards.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Storage capacity calculations===\nThe format of the Card-Specific Data (CSD) register changed between version 1 (SDSC) and version 2.0 (which defines SDHC and SDXC).\n\n====Version 1====\nIn version 1 of the SD specification, capacities up to 2&nbsp;GB are calculated by combining fields of the CSD as follows:\n\n Capacity = ('''C_SIZE''' + 1) \u00d7 2<sup>('''C_SIZE_MULT''' + '''READ_BL_LEN''' + 2)</sup>\n where\n   0 \u2264 '''C_SIZE''' \u2264 4095,\n   0 \u2264 '''C_SIZE_MULT''' \u2264 7,\n   '''READ_BL_LEN''' is 9 (for 512 bytes/sector) or 10 (for 1024 bytes/sector)\n\nLater versions state (at Section 4.3.2) that a 2&nbsp;GB SDSC card shall set its READ_BL_LEN (and WRITE_BL_LEN) to indicate 1024 bytes, so that the above computation correctly reports the card's capacity; but that, for consistency, the host device shall not request (by CMD16) block lengths over 512 B.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" />\n\n====Versions 2 and 3====\nIn the definition of SDHC cards in version 2.0, the C_SIZE portion of the CSD is 22 bits and it indicates the memory size in multiples of 512&nbsp;KiB (the C_SIZE_MULT field is removed and READ_BL_LEN is no longer used to compute capacity). Two bits that were formerly reserved now identify the card family: 0 is SDSC; 1 is SDHC or SDXC; 2 and 3 are reserved.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" /> Because of these redefinitions, older host devices do not correctly identify SDHC or SDXC cards nor their correct capacity.\n\n* SDHC cards are restricted to reporting a capacity not over 32&nbsp;GB.\n* SDXC cards are allowed to use all 22 bits of the C_SIZE field. An SDHC card that did so (reported C_SIZE > 65375 to indicate a capacity of over 32&nbsp;GB) would violate the specification. A host device that relied on C_SIZE rather than the specification to determine the card's maximum capacity might support such a card, but the card might fail in other SDHC-compatible host devices.\n\nCapacity is calculated thus:\n\n Capacity = ('''C_SIZE''' + 1) \u00d7 524288\n where for SDHC  \n   4112 \u2264 '''C_SIZE''' \u2264 65375  \n   \u22482&nbsp;GB \u2264 Capacity \u2264 \u224832&nbsp;GB\n where for SDXC \n   65535 \u2264 '''C_SIZE'''\n   \u224832&nbsp;GB \u2264 Capacity \u2264 2&nbsp;TB\n\nCapacities above 4&nbsp;GB can only be achieved by following version 2.0 or later versions. In addition, capacities equal to 4&nbsp;GB must also do so to guarantee compatibility.\n\n==Openness of specification==\n[[File:SD-microSD adaptor.jpg|thumb|upright|Dismantled microSD to SD adapter showing the passive connection from the microSD card slot on the bottom to the SD pins on the top]]\n\nLike most memory card formats, SD is covered by numerous [[patent]]s and [[trademark]]s. Excluding [[Secure Digital#SDIO cards|SDIO]] cards, [[Royalty payment|royalties]] for SD card licenses are imposed for manufacture and sale of memory cards and host adapters (US$1,000/year plus membership at US$1,500/year)\n\nEarly versions of the SD specification were available under a [[non-disclosure agreement]] (NDA) prohibiting development of [[open-source software|open-source]] drivers. However, the system was eventually [[reverse-engineered]] and free software drivers provided access to SD cards not using DRM. Subsequent to the release of most open-source drivers, the SDA provided a simplified version of the specification under a less restrictive license helping reduce some incompatibility issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linux.com/archive/feed/20060 |title=Sharp Linux PDA promotes the use of proprietary SD card, but more open MMC works just fine |publisher=Linux.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref>\n\nUnder a disclaimers agreement, the simplified specification released by the SDA in 2006 \u2013 as opposed to that of SD cards \u2013 which later extended to the physical layer, ASSD extensions, SDIO, and SDIO [[Bluetooth]] Type-A.<ref>[http://www.sdcard.org/developers/tech/sdcard/pls/ Simplified Specification Agreement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028165644/http://www.sdcard.org/developers/tech/sdcard/pls/ |date=2008-10-28 }} from the SDA's website</ref> Again, most of the information had already been discovered and [[Linux]] had a fully free driver for it. Still, building a chip conforming to this specification caused the [[One Laptop per Child]] project to claim \"the first truly Open Source SD implementation, with no need to obtain an SDI license or sign NDAs to create SD drivers or applications.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mailman.laptop.org/pipermail/community-news/2006-September/000023.html |title=OLPC mailing list archive |publisher=Mailman.laptop.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110412094819/http://mailman.laptop.org/pipermail/community-news/2006-September/000023.html|archivedate=2011-04-12}}</ref>\n\nThe proprietary nature of the complete SD specification affects [[embedded system]]s, laptop computers, and some desktop computers; many desktop computers do not have card slots, instead using [[USB]]-based [[card reader#Memory card readers|card readers]] if necessary. These card readers present a standard [[USB mass storage]] interface to memory cards, thus separating the operating system from the details of the underlying SD interface. However, embedded systems (such as portable music players) usually gain direct access to SD cards and thus need complete programming information. Desktop card readers are themselves embedded systems; their manufacturers have usually paid the SDA for complete access to the SD specifications. Many notebook computers now include SD card readers not based on USB; device drivers for these essentially gain direct access to the SD card, as do embedded systems.\n\nThe [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus|SPI]]-bus interface mode is the only type that does not require a host license for accessing SD cards.\n\n==Comparison to other flash memory formats==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\n[[File:Flash memory cards size.jpg|thumb|upright|Size comparison of various flash cards: SD, [[CompactFlash]], [[MultiMediaCard|MMC]], [[xD-Picture Card|xD]]]]\n\nOverall, SD is less open than [[CompactFlash]] or [[USB flash drive|USB flash memory drives]]. Those [[open standard]]s can be implemented without paying for licensing, royalties, or documentation. (CompactFlash and USB flash drives may require licensing fees for the use of the SDA's trademarked logos.)\n\nHowever, SD is much more open than [[Memory Stick|Sony's Memory Stick]], for which no public documentation nor any documented legacy implementation is available. All SD cards can be accessed freely using the well-documented [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus|SPI]] bus.\n\n[[xD-Picture Card|xD]] cards are simply 18-pin [[NAND flash]] chips in a special package and support [[XD-Picture Card#Raw hardware|the standard command set]] for raw NAND flash access. Although the raw hardware interface to xD cards is well understood, the layout of its memory contents\u2014necessary for interoperability with xD card readers and digital cameras\u2014is totally undocumented. The consortium that licenses xD cards has not released any technical information to the public.\n\n{{Comparison of memory cards}}\n\n==Data recovery==\nA malfunctioning SD card can be repaired using specialized equipment, as long as the middle part, containing the flash storage, is not physically damaged.

Situated on [[Cape Breton Island]]'s east coast, it belongs administratively to the [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality]]. Sydney was founded in 1785 by the British, was incorporated as a city in 1904, and dissolved on 1 August 1995, when it was amalgamated into the regional municipality.\n\nSydney served as the Cape Breton Island colony's capital, until 1820, when the colony merged with Nova Scotia and the capital moved to [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]].\n\nA rapid population expansion occurred just after the turn of the 20th century, when Sydney was home to one of North America's main steel mills. During both the First and Second World Wars, it was a major staging area for England-bound [[Order of battle for Convoy SC 7|convoys]]. The post-war period witnessed a major decline in the number of people employed at the [[Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation]] (DOSCO) steel mill, and the Nova Scotia and Canadian governments had to [[nationalization|nationalize]] it in 1967 to save the region's biggest employer, forming the new crown corporation called the [[Sydney Steel Corporation]] (SYSCO).{{sfnp|Lebel|1967-10-18|pp=1,2}} The city's population has steadily decreased since the early 1970s due to the plant's fortunes, and SYSCO was finally closed in 2001. Today, the main industries are in customer support call centres and tourism. Together with [[Sydney Mines]], [[North Sydney, Nova Scotia|North Sydney]], [[New Waterford, Nova Scotia|New Waterford]], and [[Glace Bay]], Sydney forms the [[Industrial Cape Breton]] region.\n\n==History==\n===Early history 1700s to 1899===\nPrior to a permanent settlement being established, there was significant activity along the shore. \nDuring the [[American Revolution]], on 1 November 1776, [[John Paul Jones]] \u2013 the father of the [[United States Navy|American Navy]] \u2013 set sail in command of ''Alfred'' to free hundreds of American prisoners working in the coal mines in eastern Cape Breton. Although winter conditions prevented the freeing of the prisoners, the mission did result in the capture of the ''Mellish'', a vessel carrying a vital supply of winter clothing intended for [[John Burgoyne]]'s troops in Canada. A few years into the war there was also [[Action of 21 July 1781|a naval engagement]] between French ships and a British convoy off Sydney, Nova Scotia, near Spanish River (1781), Cape Breton.{{sfnp|Akins|1895|p=82}}  The French were recoaling their ships and defeated a British convoy. Six French sailors were killed and 17 British, with many more wounded.\n\nSydney was founded after the war by Colonel [[Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres]], and named in honour of [[Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney]],{{sfnp|Brown|1922|p=140}}{{sfnp|Public Archives of Nova Scotia|1967|p=657}} who was serving as the [[Home Secretary]] in the British cabinet.{{sfnp|Morgan|2008|p=64}}  Lord Sydney appointed Col. DesBarres lieutenant-governor of the new colony of [[Cape Breton Island]].{{sfnp|Morgan|2008|p=65}}  In November 1784 the 600-ton ship ''Blenheim'' landed a group that consisted primarily of English citizens and disbanded soldiers. A group of [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] from the state of [[New York (state)|New York]] (which included [[David Mathews]], the former Mayor of [[New York City]] under the British), fleeing the aftermath of the [[American Revolution]], were added to the immigrants upon their arrival in the neighbouring colony of [[Nova Scotia]].  DesBarres arrived at Sydney on 7 January 1785.  He held the first meeting of his executive council on 21 February 1785, where he was proclaimed lieutenant-governor in a formal manner and the first minutes of the new colony were taken.{{sfnp|Morgan|2008|p=66}}  The site DesBarres chose for the new settlement was along the Southwest Arm of Sydney Harbour,{{sfnp|Morgan|2008|p=66}} a drowned valley of the [[Sydney River]], which forms part of [[Spanish Bay (Nova Scotia)|Spanish Bay]]. Between 1784 and 1820, Sydney was the capital of the British colony of Cape Breton Island.{{sfnp|Morgan|2008|p=92}} The colony was disbanded and merged with neighbouring Nova Scotia as part of the British government's desire to develop the abundant [[coal]] fields surrounding Sydney Harbour; the leases being held by the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]].{{sfnp|Morgan|2008|p=161}}  In 1826, the leases were transferred to the General Mining Association{{sfnp|Morgan|2008|p=162}} and industrial development around Sydney began to take shape.\n\n===Steel city 1900\u20131945===\nBy the early 20th century Sydney became home to one of the world's largest steel plants, fed by the numerous coal mines in the area under the ownership of the [[Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation]] (DOSCO). Sydney's economy was a significant part of Industrial Cape Breton with its steel plant and harbour and railway connections adjoining the coal mining towns of [[Glace Bay, Nova Scotia|Glace Bay]], [[New Waterford, Nova Scotia|New Waterford]], [[Sydney Mines]] and [[Reserve Mines]]. The economic boom brought about by industrialization saw the community incorporate as a city in 1903. The growth continued until the 1930s, with the [[Great Depression]] causing a slow down in production and growth. World War Two brought prosperity again for the plant, and the coal mines.\n[[File:Sydney Harbour aerial view.jpg|left|thumb|320px|Sydney Harbour aerial view looking towards the north-east.]]\nSydney Harbour played an important role during [[World War II]] once a [[Royal Canadian Navy]] base, {{HMCS|Protector}}, was established to stage supply [[convoy]]s bound for Europe. These convoys tended to be slower and had the prefix SC for Slow Convoy.{{sfnp|Caplan|1976|pp=27\u201440}} [[Convoy SC 7]] typified the dangers inherent with the [[Nazi]] [[U-boats]] off the coast of Cape Breton and Newfoundland during the [[Battle of the Atlantic]], when 20 of the 35 merchant cargo vessels were sunk on their journey to England. Sydney Harbour was one of the hotspots of the [[Battle of the St. Lawrence]]. Two notable shipping attacks occurred during this battle: the sinking of the train ferry {{SS|Caribou}} in October 1942 on its way from North Sydney to [[Channel-Port aux Basques|Port aux Basques]], Newfoundland;{{sfnp|Sarty|2012|pp=194, 209\u2014210, 213}} and the sinking of the Sydney-based HMCS ''Shawinigan''<!-- Currently there is no article for this particular ship, please do not wikilink it as it will point to the current vessel bearing that name. --> on 24 November 1944 in the Cabot Strait, near Cape North, on Cape Breton Island.{{sfnp|Sarty|2012|pp=284\u2014287}} Sydney's coal shipping and steel manufacturing made a significant contribution to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war effort, however federal Minister of Industry, [[C. D. Howe]] favoured Central Canada's steel industry given its proximity to a larger workforce and less exposure to coastal attack.\n\n===Post-war years 1950\u20132014===\nBy the late 1960s the coal and steel industries had fallen on hard times.{{sfnp|Star Staff|1967-11-23|p=1}} Friday, 13 October 1967, became known as \"Black Friday,\" so named after [[Hawker Siddeley Canada]], the plant's owners, announced they were closing it in April 1968.{{sfnp|Doyle|2011|p=220}} Both the provincial and federal government were involved in negotiating with the steel plant's owners, when Cape Breton's citizens held the largest protest in the city's history on 19 November 1967: \"The Parade of Concern.\"{{sfnp|CP Special|1967-11-20|p=5}} Around 20,000 people marched about a mile from the plant's gates to a horse racetrack to show their support for the steel plant.{{sfnp|CP Special|1967-11-20|p=5}} Newly appointed Nova Scotia premier [[George Isaac Smith|G.I. Smith]] and federal Health Minister, and Cape Breton MP, [[Allan MacEachen|Allan J. MacEachen]] spoke to the crowd and assured them that their respective governments were going to help.{{sfnp|CP Special|1967-11-20|p=5}} Four days later the Smith government announced that they were taking over the plant starting in 1968.{{sfnp|Special to the Star|1967-11-23|p=1}}\n\nBoth the steel and coal industries continued under government ownership for the rest of the 20th century. By the early 1990s, both industries were in trouble again, and were permanently closed by the end of 2001.\nForced to diversify its economy after the closures of the steel plant and coal industries, Sydney has examined a variety of economic development possibilities including tourism and culture, light manufacturing and information technology. Cleaning up the former steel plant, and the toxic [[Sydney Tar Ponds]] it left behind in Muggah's Creek, were a source of controversy due to its health effects on residents, although it has provided some employment since SYSCO closed.<ref>Walker, T.

Elevation ranges from [[sea level]] to {{convert|66|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level.\n\nThe majority of properties within the former city limits have been impacted by development and an extensive urban road network.  The central business district is located on a peninsula extending into South Arm formed by Sydney River on the west side and Muggah Creek on the east side.  The largest park within the former city limits is Open Hearth Park.\n\nDistinctive neighbourhoods include Whitney Pier in the north east end next to the former steel plant site,  Ashby in the east end, Hardwood Hill in the south end and the \"North End\" located on the peninsula which contains the Holy Angels convent and the Sydney Garrison known as Victoria Park, headquarters of the Cape Breton Highlanders reserve infantry regiment.

By contrast, in most continental climates in the Northern Hemisphere, January is the coldest month, July the warmest.\n\nIn other respects, too, Sydney's climate varies significantly from that of other areas with humid continental climates. The most significant variations are that Sydney experiences unusually cool summers, and relatively windy, wet and stormy winters, relative to other humid-continental areas such as in the interior of North America. Annual temperatures are instead rather similar to areas around the [[Baltic Sea]] in north-eastern Europe at much higher latitudes, although Sydney's seasonal lag is stronger. Although Sydney has some maritime influence, similar latitudes on the other side of the Atlantic have significantly milder climates in all seasons except summer. Sydney is in the direct path of fall and winter storms (in the U.S., called nor'easters) migrating from the U.S. Northeastern and New England states; these storms can attain tremendous intensity by the time they approach Sydney, with high winds, heavy snow, ice and/or rain events common, primarily from October to March.  Summer thunderstorms are rare in Sydney, because nearby bodies of cool water sharply inhibit the combination of heat and humidity that fuels summer-season thunderstorms elsewhere (for example, the United States' central and southeastern states, and east-central and northern China). In recent years, possibly due to a warming climate, this has changed. In 2013 and 2016 Sydney was under a tornado watch as a result of unusually powerful thunderstorms. On August 8, 2014, a funnel cloud appeared near the Sydney Airport although no tornado warning or tornado watch was issued and the funnel did not actually touch down.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/wild-weather-prompts-tornado-watch-in-cape-breton-1.3018730|title=Wild weather prompts tornado watch in Cape Breton {{!}} CTV News Atlantic|website=atlantic.ctvnews.ca|access-date=2019-05-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.capebretonpost.com/news/local/tornado-warning-has-ended-5027/|title=Tornado warning has ended {{!}} Cape Breton Post|website=www.capebretonpost.com|language=en|access-date=2019-05-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/novascotia/1228180-stormy-weather-hits-nova-scotia|title=Stormy weather hits Nova Scotia|last=|first=|date=August 8, 2014|website=Herald News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811052900/http://thechronicleherald.ca/novascotia/1228180-stormy-weather-hits-nova-scotia|archive-date=August 11, 2014|url-status=|access-date=2019-05-04}}</ref>\n\nWhile occasional thunderstorms and other rains can occur in summer, June through August are Sydney's driest months on average. Sydney's average annual precipitation cycle reflects these realities; the year's driest month, on average, is July; its wettest month, on average, is December. Average annual precipitation in Sydney is over 1500mm, virtually the highest found anywhere in Canada outside coastal British Columbia.  Snowfall is heavy, averaging nearly 300&nbsp;cm per winter season.  However, winter-season storms are variable, and can bring changing precipitation types, commonly from ice/snow to rain and possibly back to ice/snow.  As such, actual snow accumulation is variable.  A winter storm can bring accumulating snow, followed by heavy rain, then a brief return to snow or ice, resulting in no or minimal additional snow accumulation.  Overall, Sydney's climate is moderately cold and strikingly variable, wet, stormy and windy from fall to early spring (October to March), and more stable and drier in summer (June to August).\n\n{{Weather box\n| location     = [[Sydney/J.A.

medium population centre, which for census purposes includes the neighbouring communities of Westmount, a significant portion of Sydney River, and other portions of the former Cape Breton County.{{sfnp|Statistics Canada|2012b}} The 2011 population of the Sydney census area, was 31,597,{{sfnp|Statistics Canada|2012a}} making it the largest population centre on [[Cape Breton Island]].\n\n==Economy==\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2012}}\n[[File:Norwegian Majesty in Sydney, Nova Scotia, Canada in 2006.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A cruise ship docked in Sydney Harbour, a common sight during the summer months.]]\nSydney suffered an economic decline for several decades in the later part of the 20th century as local [[coal]] and [[steel]] industries underwent significant changes. The closure of the [[Sydney Steel Corporation]]'s steel mill and the [[Cape Breton Development Corporation]]'s coal mines in 2000\u20132001 have resulted in attempts by the municipal, provincial and federal governments to diversify the area economy.\n\nAt the start of the 21st century, Sydney faces a significant challenge in the cleanup of the [[Sydney Tar Ponds]], a tidal estuary contaminated with a variety of coal-based wastes from coke ovens that supplied the steel industry. After extensive public consultation and technical study, a $400 million [[Canadian dollar|CAD]] cleanup plan jointly funded by the federal and provincial governments awaits further environmental assessment.\n\nIn one part of Whitney Pier, residents of Frederick St. discovered contamination within several homes and in surrounding soil, including a toxic orange substance oozing into local basements. Testing of the substance lasted over a year and many were outraged by delays, although some residents were subsequently relocated to a safer residential area nearby.\n\nHigh unemployment and lack of opportunities have resulted in many educated young people leaving the community for jobs in other parts of Canada and the US. Demographic changes, including an aging population and decrease in the birth rate have begun to affect the area's economic outlook. Specifically, many residents have opted to seek work in [[Alberta]] and [[Ontario]].\n\nSydney's economy was buoyed by the 2011 announcement of funding for the Sydney Harbour dredging project, which was completed in 2012. The dredge, which is expected to lead to commercialization of the port, is purported to create hundreds of jobs in the area, and position Sydney as a world-class harbour facility. Other important investments that have helped position Sydney as an eastern hub of Nova Scotia include the twinning of [[Nova Scotia Highway 125|Highway 125]] and the creation of the Centre for Sustainability in the Environment at nearby [[Cape Breton University]], which draws hundreds of international students each year.\n\n===Tourism===\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2012}}\n[[File:Sydney Fiddle.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The \"Largest Ceilidh Fiddle in the World\". Located at the Sydney waterfront.]]\nCape Breton Island has become home to a significant tourism industry, with Sydney (as the island's largest urban centre) being a prime beneficiary. Until the early 2000s when its economy was tied to the steel industry, Sydney had been overlooked as a tourist destination, with the more centrally located scenic village of [[Baddeck, Nova Scotia|Baddeck]] being a preferred location for tourists transiting the [[Cabot Trail]]. However, Sydney has witnessed a revival as a result of significant government investment in [[cruise ship]] facilities and a waterfront revitalization plan which has seen a boardwalk and marinas constructed, and the world's largest fiddle. This funding is part of the post-industrial adjustment package offered by the federal and provincial governments.\n\nSydney's tourism draw is increasingly linked to its cultural asset as being the urban heart of Cape Breton Island. Its population is a diverse mixture of nationalities which contributes to various Scottish, Acadian, African Canadian and eastern European cultural events being held throughout the year. Sydney's accommodation sector is centrally located to attractions in [[Louisbourg (community)|Louisbourg]] (home of the [[Fortress of Louisbourg]]), [[Glace Bay, Nova Scotia|Glace Bay]] (home of the Glace Bay Miners Museum), [[Baddeck, Nova Scotia|Baddeck]] (home of the Alexander Graham Bell Museum), as well as popular touring destinations such as the Cabot Trail, [[Cape Breton Highlands National Park]], and [[Bras d'Or Lake]].\n\n==Transportation==\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2012}}\nSydney is served by [[Nova Scotia Highway 125|Highway 125]] which connects to [[Nova Scotia Highway 105|Highway 105]] and encircles the former city limits to its eastern terminus.  [[Nova Scotia Trunk 4|Trunk 4]] forms an important secondary road in Sydney running along the Sydney River, connecting to [[Glace Bay, Nova Scotia|Glace Bay]].  [[Nova Scotia Trunk 22|Trunk 22]], connecting to [[Louisbourg (community)|Louisbourg]], and [[Nova Scotia Trunk 28|Trunk 28]], connecting [[Whitney Pier]] through to [[New Waterford, Nova Scotia|New Waterford]], form minor secondary roads.\n\n===Public transportation===\n[[Transit Cape Breton]] is owned and operated by the [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality]] and provides bus services in the eastern part of the municipality, which includes Sydney.\n\nTransit Cape Breton also operates \"Handi-Trans\" for passengers whose disabilities restrict them from using regular bus services.\n\nTransit fares are $1.25 per zone travelled, or $1.00 for seniors 55 & up and children 5\u201312. Depending on the number of zones travelled, the cost of riding the bus can range from $1.00 to $5.00.<ref>[http://www.cbrm.ns.ca/transit.html]</ref>\n\n===Rail===\nSydney is home to two private freight railway companies.  The [[Cape Breton and Central Nova Scotia Railway]] makes Sydney its eastern terminus and provides rail connections to [[Canadian National Railway|CN]] in [[Truro, Nova Scotia|Truro]] via [[Port Hawkesbury]].  The [[Sydney Coal Railway]] connects a bulk coal unloading pier in Whitney Pier with the [[Lingan Generating Station]] in [[Lingan, Nova Scotia|Lingan]].  Daily passenger rail service was provided by [[Via Rail|Via Rail Canada]] until budget cuts on January 15, 1990.  A weekly tourist train, the ''[[Bras d'Or (passenger train)|Bras d'Or]]'' was operated by Via Rail Canada from 2000 to 2004 until being discontinued.\n\n===Sea===\nSydney's port facilities include the privately owned bulk coal unloading pier in Whitney Pier as well as the publicly owned Sydney Marine Terminal at the northern edge of the central business district.  A recently opened cruise ship pavilion welcomes several dozen [[cruise ship]]s every year, with the majority visiting in late summer or early fall to take in [[fall foliage]] tours.  Other port facilities on Sydney Harbour are located outside the former city limits in [[Point Edward, Nova Scotia|Point Edward]] (Sydport) and [[North Sydney, Nova Scotia|North Sydney]] ([[Marine Atlantic]] ferry terminal).\n\n===Airport===\nThe [[Sydney/J.A. Douglas McCurdy Airport|J.A. Douglas McCurdy Sydney Airport]] is located several kilometres outside the former city limits in the neighbouring community of Reserve Mines.

Situated on [[Cape Breton Island]]'s east coast, it belongs administratively to the [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality]]. Sydney was founded in 1785 by the British, was incorporated as a city in 1904, and dissolved on 1 August 1995, when it was amalgamated into the regional municipality.\n\nSydney served as the Cape Breton Island colony's capital, until 1820, when the colony merged with Nova Scotia and the capital moved to [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]].\n\nA rapid population expansion occurred just after the turn of the 20th century, when Sydney was home to one of North America's main steel mills. During both the First and Second World Wars, it was a major staging area for England-bound [[Order of battle for Convoy SC 7|convoys]]. The post-war period witnessed a major decline in the number of people employed at the [[Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation]] (DOSCO) steel mill, and the Nova Scotia and Canadian governments had to [[nationalization|nationalize]] it in 1967 to save the region's biggest employer, forming the new crown corporation called the [[Sydney Steel Corporation]] (SYSCO).{{sfnp|Lebel|1967-10-18|pp=1,2}} The city's population has steadily decreased since the early 1970s due to the plant's fortunes, and SYSCO was finally closed in 2001. Today, the main industries are in customer support call centres and tourism. Together with [[Sydney Mines]], [[North Sydney, Nova Scotia|North Sydney]], [[New Waterford, Nova Scotia|New Waterford]], and [[Glace Bay]], Sydney forms the [[Industrial Cape Breton]] region.\n\n==History==\n===Early history 1700s to 1899===\nPrior to a permanent settlement being established, there was significant activity along the shore. \nDuring the [[American Revolution]], on 1 November 1776, [[John Paul Jones]] \u2013 the father of the [[United States Navy|American Navy]] \u2013 set sail in command of ''Alfred'' to free hundreds of American prisoners working in the coal mines in eastern Cape Breton. Although winter conditions prevented the freeing of the prisoners, the mission did result in the capture of the ''Mellish'', a vessel carrying a vital supply of winter clothing intended for [[John Burgoyne]]'s troops in Canada. A few years into the war there was also [[Action of 21 July 1781|a naval engagement]] between French ships and a British convoy off Sydney, Nova Scotia, near Spanish River (1781), Cape Breton.{{sfnp|Akins|1895|p=82}}  The French were recoaling their ships and defeated a British convoy. Six French sailors were killed and 17 British, with many more wounded.\n\nSydney was founded after the war by Colonel [[Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres]], and named in honour of [[Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney]],{{sfnp|Brown|1922|p=140}}{{sfnp|Public Archives of Nova Scotia|1967|p=657}} who was serving as the [[Home Secretary]] in the British cabinet.{{sfnp|Morgan|2008|p=64}}  Lord Sydney appointed Col. DesBarres lieutenant-governor of the new colony of [[Cape Breton Island]].{{sfnp|Morgan|2008|p=65}}  In November 1784 the 600-ton ship ''Blenheim'' landed a group that consisted primarily of English citizens and disbanded soldiers. A group of [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] from the state of [[New York (state)|New York]] (which included [[David Mathews]], the former Mayor of [[New York City]] under the British), fleeing the aftermath of the [[American Revolution]], were added to the immigrants upon their arrival in the neighbouring colony of [[Nova Scotia]].  DesBarres arrived at Sydney on 7 January 1785.  He held the first meeting of his executive council on 21 February 1785, where he was proclaimed lieutenant-governor in a formal manner and the first minutes of the new colony were taken.{{sfnp|Morgan|2008|p=66}}  The site DesBarres chose for the new settlement was along the Southwest Arm of Sydney Harbour,{{sfnp|Morgan|2008|p=66}} a drowned valley of the [[Sydney River]], which forms part of [[Spanish Bay (Nova Scotia)|Spanish Bay]]. Between 1784 and 1820, Sydney was the capital of the British colony of Cape Breton Island.{{sfnp|Morgan|2008|p=92}} The colony was disbanded and merged with neighbouring Nova Scotia as part of the British government's desire to develop the abundant [[coal]] fields surrounding Sydney Harbour; the leases being held by the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]].{{sfnp|Morgan|2008|p=161}}  In 1826, the leases were transferred to the General Mining Association{{sfnp|Morgan|2008|p=162}} and industrial development around Sydney began to take shape.\n\n===Steel city 1900\u20131945===\nBy the early 20th century Sydney became home to one of the world's largest steel plants, fed by the numerous coal mines in the area under the ownership of the [[Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation]] (DOSCO). Sydney's economy was a significant part of Industrial Cape Breton with its steel plant and harbour and railway connections adjoining the coal mining towns of [[Glace Bay, Nova Scotia|Glace Bay]], [[New Waterford, Nova Scotia|New Waterford]], [[Sydney Mines]] and [[Reserve Mines]]. The economic boom brought about by industrialization saw the community incorporate as a city in 1903. The growth continued until the 1930s, with the [[Great Depression]] causing a slow down in production and growth. World War Two brought prosperity again for the plant, and the coal mines.\n[[File:Sydney Harbour aerial view.jpg|left|thumb|320px|Sydney Harbour aerial view looking towards the north-east.]]\nSydney Harbour played an important role during [[World War II]] once a [[Royal Canadian Navy]] base, {{HMCS|Protector}}, was established to stage supply [[convoy]]s bound for Europe. These convoys tended to be slower and had the prefix SC for Slow Convoy.{{sfnp|Caplan|1976|pp=27\u201440}} [[Convoy SC 7]] typified the dangers inherent with the [[Nazi]] [[U-boats]] off the coast of Cape Breton and Newfoundland during the [[Battle of the Atlantic]], when 20 of the 35 merchant cargo vessels were sunk on their journey to England. Sydney Harbour was one of the hotspots of the [[Battle of the St. Lawrence]]. Two notable shipping attacks occurred during this battle: the sinking of the train ferry {{SS|Caribou}} in October 1942 on its way from North Sydney to [[Channel-Port aux Basques|Port aux Basques]], Newfoundland;{{sfnp|Sarty|2012|pp=194, 209\u2014210, 213}} and the sinking of the Sydney-based HMCS ''Shawinigan''<!-- Currently there is no article for this particular ship, please do not wikilink it as it will point to the current vessel bearing that name. --> on 24 November 1944 in the Cabot Strait, near Cape North, on Cape Breton Island.{{sfnp|Sarty|2012|pp=284\u2014287}} Sydney's coal shipping and steel manufacturing made a significant contribution to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war effort, however federal Minister of Industry, [[C. D. Howe]] favoured Central Canada's steel industry given its proximity to a larger workforce and less exposure to coastal attack.\n\n===Post-war years 1950\u20132014===\nBy the late 1960s the coal and steel industries had fallen on hard times.{{sfnp|Star Staff|1967-11-23|p=1}} Friday, 13 October 1967, became known as \"Black Friday,\" so named after [[Hawker Siddeley Canada]], the plant's owners, announced they were closing it in April 1968.{{sfnp|Doyle|2011|p=220}} Both the provincial and federal government were involved in negotiating with the steel plant's owners, when Cape Breton's citizens held the largest protest in the city's history on 19 November 1967: \"The Parade of Concern.\"{{sfnp|CP Special|1967-11-20|p=5}} Around 20,000 people marched about a mile from the plant's gates to a horse racetrack to show their support for the steel plant.{{sfnp|CP Special|1967-11-20|p=5}} Newly appointed Nova Scotia premier [[George Isaac Smith|G.I. Smith]] and federal Health Minister, and Cape Breton MP, [[Allan MacEachen|Allan J. MacEachen]] spoke to the crowd and assured them that their respective governments were going to help.{{sfnp|CP Special|1967-11-20|p=5}} Four days later the Smith government announced that they were taking over the plant starting in 1968.{{sfnp|Special to the Star|1967-11-23|p=1}}\n\nBoth the steel and coal industries continued under government ownership for the rest of the 20th century. By the early 1990s, both industries were in trouble again, and were permanently closed by the end of 2001.\nForced to diversify its economy after the closures of the steel plant and coal industries, Sydney has examined a variety of economic development possibilities including tourism and culture, light manufacturing and information technology. Cleaning up the former steel plant, and the toxic [[Sydney Tar Ponds]] it left behind in Muggah's Creek, were a source of controversy due to its health effects on residents, although it has provided some employment since SYSCO closed.<ref>Walker, T.

Elevation ranges from [[sea level]] to {{convert|66|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level.\n\nThe majority of properties within the former city limits have been impacted by development and an extensive urban road network.  The central business district is located on a peninsula extending into South Arm formed by Sydney River on the west side and Muggah Creek on the east side.  The largest park within the former city limits is Open Hearth Park.\n\nDistinctive neighbourhoods include Whitney Pier in the north east end next to the former steel plant site,  Ashby in the east end, Hardwood Hill in the south end and the \"North End\" located on the peninsula which contains the Holy Angels convent and the Sydney Garrison known as Victoria Park, headquarters of the Cape Breton Highlanders reserve infantry regiment.

By contrast, in most continental climates in the Northern Hemisphere, January is the coldest month, July the warmest.\n\nIn other respects, too, Sydney's climate varies significantly from that of other areas with humid continental climates. The most significant variations are that Sydney experiences unusually cool summers, and relatively windy, wet and stormy winters, relative to other humid-continental areas such as in the interior of North America. Annual temperatures are instead rather similar to areas around the [[Baltic Sea]] in north-eastern Europe at much higher latitudes, although Sydney's seasonal lag is stronger. Although Sydney has some maritime influence, similar latitudes on the other side of the Atlantic have significantly milder climates in all seasons except summer. Sydney is in the direct path of fall and winter storms (in the U.S., called nor'easters) migrating from the U.S. Northeastern and New England states; these storms can attain tremendous intensity by the time they approach Sydney, with high winds, heavy snow, ice and/or rain events common, primarily from October to March.  Summer thunderstorms are rare in Sydney, because nearby bodies of cool water sharply inhibit the combination of heat and humidity that fuels summer-season thunderstorms elsewhere (for example, the United States' central and southeastern states, and east-central and northern China). In recent years, possibly due to a warming climate, this has changed. In 2013 and 2016 Sydney was under a tornado watch as a result of unusually powerful thunderstorms. On August 8, 2014, a funnel cloud appeared near the Sydney Airport although no tornado warning or tornado watch was issued and the funnel did not actually touch down.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/wild-weather-prompts-tornado-watch-in-cape-breton-1.3018730|title=Wild weather prompts tornado watch in Cape Breton {{!}} CTV News Atlantic|website=atlantic.ctvnews.ca|access-date=2019-05-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.capebretonpost.com/news/local/tornado-warning-has-ended-5027/|title=Tornado warning has ended {{!}} Cape Breton Post|website=www.capebretonpost.com|language=en|access-date=2019-05-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/novascotia/1228180-stormy-weather-hits-nova-scotia|title=Stormy weather hits Nova Scotia|last=|first=|date=August 8, 2014|website=Herald News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811052900/http://thechronicleherald.ca/novascotia/1228180-stormy-weather-hits-nova-scotia|archive-date=August 11, 2014|url-status=|access-date=2019-05-04}}</ref>\n\nWhile occasional thunderstorms and other rains can occur in summer, June through August are Sydney's driest months on average. Sydney's average annual precipitation cycle reflects these realities; the year's driest month, on average, is July; its wettest month, on average, is December. Average annual precipitation in Sydney is over 1500mm, virtually the highest found anywhere in Canada outside coastal British Columbia.  Snowfall is heavy, averaging nearly 300&nbsp;cm per winter season.  However, winter-season storms are variable, and can bring changing precipitation types, commonly from ice/snow to rain and possibly back to ice/snow.  As such, actual snow accumulation is variable.  A winter storm can bring accumulating snow, followed by heavy rain, then a brief return to snow or ice, resulting in no or minimal additional snow accumulation.  Overall, Sydney's climate is moderately cold and strikingly variable, wet, stormy and windy from fall to early spring (October to March), and more stable and drier in summer (June to August).\n\n{{Weather box\n| location     = [[Sydney/J.A.

County.{{sfnp|Statistics Canada|2012b}} The 2011 population of the Sydney census area, was 31,597,{{sfnp|Statistics Canada|2012a}} making it the largest population centre on [[Cape Breton

Harbour, a common sight during the summer months.]]\nSydney suffered an economic decline for several decades in the later part of the 20th century as local [[coal]] and [[steel]] industries underwent significant changes. The closure of the [[Sydney Steel Corporation]]'s steel mill and the [[Cape Breton Development Corporation]]'s coal mines in 2000\u20132001 have resulted in attempts by the municipal, provincial and federal governments to diversify the area economy.\n\nAt the start of the 21st century, Sydney faces a significant challenge in the cleanup of the [[Sydney Tar Ponds]], a tidal estuary contaminated with a variety of coal-based wastes from coke ovens that supplied the steel industry. After extensive public consultation and technical study, a $400 million [[Canadian dollar|CAD]] cleanup plan jointly funded by the federal and provincial governments awaits further environmental assessment.\n\nIn one part of Whitney Pier, residents of Frederick St. discovered contamination within several homes and in surrounding soil, including a toxic orange substance oozing into local basements. Testing of the substance lasted over a year and many were outraged by delays, although some residents were subsequently relocated to a safer residential area nearby.\n\nHigh unemployment and lack of opportunities have resulted in many educated young people leaving the community for jobs in other parts of Canada and the US. Demographic changes, including an aging population and decrease in the birth rate have begun to affect the area's economic outlook. Specifically, many residents have opted to seek work in [[Alberta]] and [[Ontario]].\n\nSydney's economy was buoyed by the 2011 announcement of funding for the Sydney Harbour dredging project, which was completed in 2012. The dredge, which is expected to lead to commercialization of the port, is purported to create hundreds of jobs in the area, and position Sydney as a world-class harbour facility. Other important investments that have helped position Sydney as an eastern hub of Nova Scotia include the twinning of [[Nova Scotia Highway 125|Highway 125]] and the creation of the Centre for Sustainability in the Environment at nearby [[Cape Breton University]], which draws hundreds of international students each year.\n\n===Tourism===\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2012}}\n[[File:Sydney Fiddle.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The \"Largest Ceilidh Fiddle in the World\". Located at the Sydney waterfront.]]\nCape Breton Island has become home to a significant tourism industry, with Sydney (as the island's largest urban centre) being a prime beneficiary. Until the early 2000s when its economy was tied to the steel industry, Sydney had been overlooked as a tourist destination, with the more centrally located scenic village of [[Baddeck, Nova Scotia|Baddeck]] being a preferred location for tourists transiting the [[Cabot Trail]]. However, Sydney has witnessed a revival as a result of significant government investment in [[cruise ship]] facilities and a waterfront revitalization plan which has seen a boardwalk and marinas constructed, and the world's largest fiddle. This funding is part of the post-industrial adjustment package offered by the federal and provincial governments.\n\nSydney's tourism draw is increasingly linked to its cultural asset as being the urban heart of Cape Breton Island. Its population is a diverse mixture of nationalities which contributes to various Scottish, Acadian, African Canadian and eastern European cultural events being held throughout the year. Sydney's accommodation sector is centrally located to attractions in [[Louisbourg (community)|Louisbourg]] (home of the [[Fortress of Louisbourg]]), [[Glace Bay, Nova Scotia|Glace Bay]] (home of the Glace Bay Miners Museum), [[Baddeck, Nova Scotia|Baddeck]] (home of the Alexander Graham Bell Museum), as well as popular touring destinations such as the Cabot Trail, [[Cape Breton Highlands National Park]], and [[Bras d'Or Lake]].\n\n==Transportation==\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2012}}\nSydney is served by [[Nova Scotia Highway 125|Highway 125]] which connects to [[Nova Scotia Highway 105|Highway 105]] and encircles the former city limits to its eastern terminus.  [[Nova Scotia Trunk 4|Trunk 4]] forms an important secondary road in Sydney running along the Sydney River, connecting to [[Glace Bay, Nova Scotia|Glace Bay]].  [[Nova Scotia Trunk 22|Trunk 22]], connecting to [[Louisbourg (community)|Louisbourg]], and [[Nova Scotia Trunk 28|Trunk 28]], connecting [[Whitney Pier]] through to [[New Waterford, Nova Scotia|New Waterford]], form minor secondary roads.\n\n===Public transportation===\n[[Transit Cape Breton]] is owned and operated by the [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality]] and provides bus services in the eastern part of the municipality, which includes Sydney.\n\nTransit Cape Breton also operates \"Handi-Trans\" for passengers whose disabilities restrict them from using regular bus services.\n\nTransit fares are $1.25 per zone travelled, or $1.00 for seniors 55 & up and children 5\u201312. Depending on the number of zones travelled, the cost of riding the bus can range from $1.00 to $5.00.<ref>[http://www.cbrm.ns.ca/transit.html]</ref>\n\n===Rail===\nSydney is home to two private freight railway companies.  The [[Cape Breton and Central Nova Scotia Railway]] makes Sydney its eastern terminus and provides rail connections to [[Canadian National Railway|CN]] in [[Truro, Nova Scotia|Truro]] via [[Port Hawkesbury]].  The [[Sydney Coal Railway]] connects a bulk coal unloading pier in Whitney Pier with the [[Lingan Generating Station]] in [[Lingan, Nova Scotia|Lingan]].  Daily passenger rail service was provided by [[Via Rail|Via Rail Canada]] until budget cuts on January 15, 1990.  A weekly tourist train, the ''[[Bras d'Or (passenger train)|Bras d'Or]]'' was operated by Via Rail Canada from 2000 to 2004 until being discontinued.\n\n===Sea===\nSydney's port facilities include the privately owned bulk coal unloading pier in Whitney Pier as well as the publicly owned Sydney Marine Terminal at the northern edge of the central business district.  A recently opened cruise ship pavilion welcomes several dozen [[cruise ship]]s every year, with the majority visiting in late summer or early fall to take in [[fall foliage]] tours.  Other port facilities on Sydney Harbour are located outside the former city limits in [[Point Edward, Nova Scotia|Point Edward]] (Sydport) and [[North Sydney, Nova Scotia|North Sydney]] ([[Marine Atlantic]] ferry terminal).\n\n===Airport===\nThe [[Sydney/J.A.

He was the leader of the [[People's National Party]] from 1992 to 2005, and the Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of Westmoreland South Eastern from 1970 to [[1980 Jamaican general election|1980]] (when he lost to Euphemia Williams of the [[Jamaica Labour Party]]) and again from 1989 to 1993. Following a constituency reorganization, he served as the MP for Westmoreland Eastern from 1993 to 2005. He retired from all of these positions in January 2005. He was married to [[Shirley Field-Ridley]] (d. 1982) with whom he had two children, Richard and Sharon.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/28/obituaries/shirley-field-ridley-45-held-posts-in-the-guyana-cabinet.html \"Shirley Field-Ridley, 45, Held Posts in the Guyana Cabinet\" (obituary)], ''New York Times'', 28 June 1982.</ref>\n\nCabinet positions he held during his political career include Minister of Industry and Tourism; Minister of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade; Minister of Development, Planning and Production; Minister of Finance and Planning.<ref>[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/westernnews/33474_Profile-on-PJ-Patterson \"Profile on PJ Patterson\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029210904/http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/westernnews/33474_Profile-on-PJ-Patterson |date=29 October 2013}}, ''Jamaica Observer'', 12 October 2002.</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nP.J.'s parents were Henry Patterson, a farmer, and Ina James, a primary school teacher, who both hailed from the [[Hanover Parish]] in western [[Jamaica]]. Patterson received his secondary education at one of Jamaica's most prominent learning institutions, [[Calabar High School]], before moving on to pursue higher studies at the [[University of the West Indies|University College of West Indies]] and later the [[London School of Economics]].<ref>https://nlj.gov.jm/biographies/rt-hon-percival-james-patterson-1935/ Retrieved 29 March 2019.</ref>\n\nWhile pursuing his bachelor's degree in English at the [[University of the West Indies]], he served as Chairman of the university's External Affairs Commission, where he gained exposure to world leaders and international political thought through attendance at a number of international student fora. It was also at university that he developed a commitment to [[Caribbean#Regionalism|Caribbean regionalism]] as well as to the causes of the countries of the developing world. In 1958, he graduated with a B.A. (Honours).<ref>https://nlj.gov.jm/biographies/rt-hon-percival-james-patterson-1935/ Retrieved 29 March 2019.</ref>\n\nHis time as a Law student of the [[London School of Economics]] consolidated the foundation in international politics that his university experience in Jamaica had provided. He was awarded the Leverhume Scholarship, and the Sir Hughes Parry prize for Excellence in the Law of Contracts.<ref>https://nlj.gov.jm/biographies/rt-hon-percival-james-patterson-1935/ Retrieved 29 March 2019.</ref>\n\nDuring his enrolment at the [[Inns of Court]] (Middle Temple) he again came in contact with a number of future leaders of the countries of the developing world who were fellow students in England.\n\n==Early political life==\nPatterson joined the organising staff of the [[People's National Party]] in 1958, and he became a member of the party's National and Executive Councils in 1964. Patterson entered the [[Parliament of Jamaica]] as an Opposition Senator in 1969, appointed by Opposition Leader [[Norman Manley]]. He was elected the youngest ever Vice President of the [[People's National Party]] later that year at age 33.<ref>https://nlj.gov.jm/biographies/rt-hon-percival-james-patterson-1935/ Retrieved 29 March 2019.</ref>\n\nWhen in 1969 his predecessor as Prime Minister of Jamaica, [[Michael Manley]], launched his campaign for the Presidency of the PNP, he turned to P. J. Patterson, youngest of the highest-ranking segment of the party executive, to lead his campaign. This was the beginning of a partnership which endured over the next 23 years, and allowed for an exchange of political ideas and perspectives that proved beneficial to both.\n\nPatterson was elected the Member of Parliament for Westmoreland South Eastern in the constituency's by-election of 1970. The constituency borders were reorganized prior to the [[1993 Jamaican general election|general election of 1993]] and he was elected as the Member of Parliament for Westmoreland Eastern in that election, a seat he held until his retirement in 2006.\n\nHe was Campaign Manager for the [[Peoples National Party|People's National Party]]'s bid for power in the General Elections of 1972, demonstrating skill as a political organizer that played a significant role in the party's victory at the polls that year. This led to his first appointment to the Jamaican Cabinet as Minister of Industry, Trade and Tourism. From 1978-1980, Patterson served as deputy prime minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade.<ref>https://nlj.gov.jm/biographies/rt-hon-percival-james-patterson-1935/ Retrieved 29 March 2019.</ref>\n\nThe PNP were voted out of power in 1980, and Patterson lost his seat to Euphemia Williams. However, in 1983, he was elected party chairman, and the PNP won by a landslide in 1989, and Patterson was back as deputy prime minister. From 1989-1990, Patterson was also Minister of Development, Planning and Production, and from 1990-1, he was Minister of Finance and Planning.<ref>https://nlj.gov.jm/biographies/rt-hon-percival-james-patterson-1935/ Retrieved 29 March 2019.</ref>\n\n==Premiership==\nHe assumed office as Prime Minister after [[Michael Manley]] retired in 1992, at a time when the Caribbean island nation was facing the formidable challenge of securing a place in a new global order of economic [[liberalization]] and [[deregulation]]. In 1993, Patterson led the PNP to a second consecutive victory in the polls, winning 52 of the 60 seats up for grabs.<ref>https://nlj.gov.jm/biographies/rt-hon-percival-james-patterson-1935/ Retrieved 29 March 2019.</ref>\n\nPatterson led efforts to strengthen the country's social protection and security systems\u2014a critical element of his economic and social policy agenda to mitigate, reduce poverty and social deprivation.<ref>Franklyn, Delano (ed.): 2002.

Kingston, Jamaica: Ian Randle Publishers.</ref>\n\nIn 1997, Patterson led the PNP to a third consecutive victory, breaking the \"third-term barrier\". The PNP won 50 of the 60 seats available.\n\nHis massive investments in modernization of Jamaica's [[infrastructure]] and restructuring of the country's financial sector are widely credited with having led to Jamaica's greatest period of investment in tourism, mining, [[Information and communication technologies|ICT]] and energy since the 1960s. He also ended Jamaica's 18-year borrowing relationship with the [[International Monetary Fund]],<ref>[http://www.imf.org/external/country/jam/index.htm Jamaica and the IMF.]</ref> allowing the country greater latitude in pursuit of its economic policies. In 2002, when Patterson led the PNP to another general election victory, but with a much-reduced majority of 34 out of 60 seats. He became the first Jamaican prime minister to be sworn in for a fourth consecutive term.<ref>https://nlj.gov.jm/biographies/rt-hon-percival-james-patterson-1935/ Retrieved 29 March 2019.</ref>\n\nIn September 2003 Patterson told a party conference that he wanted Jamaica to be a [[republic]] by the time he left office in 2007, saying \"The majority of people in Jamaica are ready to consign to history the last vestiges of colonialism\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3127742.stm|title=Jamaica eyes republican future|work=BBC News|date=2003-09-22|accessdate=2014-08-14}}</ref> Patterson had long supported moves to make Jamaica a republic, but he was unsuccessful in this aim, as Jamaica is still a monarchy.

Patterson arranged for Aristide to take up temporary residence in Jamaica during Aristide's lawsuit against the United States and France accusing the countries of kidnapping him.\n\nIn one of his final initiatives as Prime Minister, he launched a program of radical transformation of the island's [[education]] system aimed at development of quality human capital equipped to succeed in the competitive [[globalization|global economy]].<ref>Franklyn, Delano (ed.), 2002.

Georgieva, ''Building Equality and Opportunity through Social Guarantees: new approaches to public policy and the realization of rights''.</ref>\n\nIn 2000-2004 murder rate in Jamaica increased from 32 to 58.\n\n==Post-premiership==\nFollowing his premiership, from 2006 to 2007, he chaired the [[Committee on Commonwealth Membership]], which presented its report<ref>[http://www.thecommonwealth.org/shared_asp_files/GFSR.asp?NodeID=174532 Report of the Committee on Commonwealth Membership, 2007 CHOGM.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426044116/http://www.thecommonwealth.org/shared_asp_files/GFSR.asp?NodeID=174532 |date=26 April 2009 }}</ref> on potential changes in [[Commonwealth of Nations membership criteria|membership criteria]] for the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] at the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2007]] in [[Kampala]], [[Uganda]].\n\n==International service==\nPatterson is a member of the Club de Madrid, a group that consists of more than 100 former Presidents and Prime Ministers of democratic countries, which works to strengthen democracy and democratic leadership worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.clubmadrid.org/en/estructura/former_heads_of_state_and_government_1/letra:p |title=Club de Madrid website. |access-date=23 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923204848/http://www.clubmadrid.org/en/estructura/former_heads_of_state_and_government_1/letra:p |archive-date=23 September 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nPatterson has contributed to numerous Conventions and Statements in the international arena including the Valletta Statement on Multilateral Trade and the Gozo Statement on Vulnerable Small States. These have helped to shape north-south relationship and influence the negotiating position of developing countries.\n\nHe is a member of the [[Global Leadership Foundation]], an [[NGO]] composed of a number of former statesmen, ex-presidents and Prime Ministers founded in 2004 by former State President of [[South Africa]] and [[Nobel Prize]] laureate [[F. W. de Klerk]].  The Global Leadership Foundation is an organization which works to support democratic leadership, prevent and resolve conflict through mediation and promote good governance in the form of democratic institutions, open markets, human rights and the rule of law. It does so by making available, discreetly and in confidence, the experience of former leaders to today's national leaders. It is a not-for-profit organization composed of former heads of government, senior governmental and international organization officials who work closely with Heads of Government on governance-related issues of concern to them.\n\nHe played a seminal role in the process that marked the transition from the first steps in integration of the Caribbean region to the founding of CARIFTA and its evolution into [[CARICOM]]. He drew upon his expertise in law and trade, to steer the regional body toward the development of a Caribbean jurisprudence through the [[Caribbean Court of Justice]], and a borderless regional economy through the [[CARICOM Single Market]], which came to fruition in 2005 and 2006 respectively.\n\nDuring his tenure as Jamaica's Foreign Minister he served as President of the [[African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States|ACP]]/[[European Union|EU]] Ministerial Council and led negotiations for the [[African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States|ACP]] group of countries with the European Community. As Chairman of the ACP/EEC Ministerial Conference, he played a pivotal role in forging an agreement on the basic framework for the original [[Lom\u00e9 Convention]], which influenced the outcome of subsequent negotiations that led to the Convention signed in 1975. He has served as President and Spokesman of the ACP Ministerial Council on a number of occasions.\n\nA passionate opponent of [[apartheid]], he was an ardent proponent of [[South Africa]]'s liberation movement.\n\n==Memberships and awards==\nUpon becoming the Prime Minister of Jamaica in 1992 Patterson was invested with the [[Order of the Nation]], allowing him to be known as \"The Most Honourable\" and to use the post-nominal letters \"ON\".\n\nIn 2006 he was invested with the [[Order of Excellence of Guyana]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20070807150647/http://www.op.gov.gy/stories/060529.html] allowing him to use the post-nominal letters \"OE\".

He was the leader of the [[People's National Party]] from 1992 to 2005, and the Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of Westmoreland South Eastern from 1970 to [[1980 Jamaican general election|1980]] (when he lost to Euphemia Williams of the [[Jamaica Labour Party]]) and again from 1989 to 1993. Following a constituency reorganization, he served as the MP for Westmoreland Eastern from 1993 to 2005. He retired from all of these positions in January 2005. He was married to [[Shirley Field-Ridley]] (d. 1982) with whom he had two children, Richard and Sharon.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/28/obituaries/shirley-field-ridley-45-held-posts-in-the-guyana-cabinet.html \"Shirley Field-Ridley, 45, Held Posts in the Guyana Cabinet\" (obituary)], ''New York Times'', 28 June 1982.</ref>\n\nCabinet positions he held during his political career include Minister of Industry and Tourism; Minister of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade; Minister of Development, Planning and Production; Minister of Finance and Planning.<ref>[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/westernnews/33474_Profile-on-PJ-Patterson \"Profile on PJ Patterson\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029210904/http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/westernnews/33474_Profile-on-PJ-Patterson |date=29 October 2013}}, ''Jamaica Observer'', 12 October 2002.</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nP.J.'s parents were Henry Patterson, a farmer, and Ina James, a primary school teacher, who both hailed from the [[Hanover Parish]] in western [[Jamaica]]. Patterson received his secondary education at one of Jamaica's most prominent learning institutions, [[Calabar High School]], before moving on to pursue higher studies at the [[University of the West Indies|University College of West Indies]] and later the [[London School of Economics]].<ref>https://nlj.gov.jm/biographies/rt-hon-percival-james-patterson-1935/ Retrieved 29 March 2019.</ref>\n\nWhile pursuing his bachelor's degree in English at the [[University of the West Indies]], he served as Chairman of the university's External Affairs Commission, where he gained exposure to world leaders and international political thought through attendance at a number of international student fora. It was also at university that he developed a commitment to [[Caribbean#Regionalism|Caribbean regionalism]] as well as to the causes of the countries of the developing world. In 1958, he graduated with a B.A. (Honours).<ref>https://nlj.gov.jm/biographies/rt-hon-percival-james-patterson-1935/ Retrieved 29 March 2019.</ref>\n\nHis time as a Law student of the [[London School of Economics]] consolidated the foundation in international politics that his university experience in Jamaica had provided. He was awarded the Leverhume Scholarship, and the Sir Hughes Parry prize for Excellence in the Law of Contracts.<ref>https://nlj.gov.jm/biographies/rt-hon-percival-james-patterson-1935/ Retrieved 29 March 2019.</ref>\n\nDuring his enrolment at the [[Inns of Court]] (Middle Temple) he again came in contact with a number of future leaders of the countries of the developing world who were fellow students in England.\n\n==Early political life==\nPatterson joined the organising staff of the [[People's National Party]] in 1958, and he became a member of the party's National and Executive Councils in 1964. Patterson entered the [[Parliament of Jamaica]] as an Opposition Senator in 1969, appointed by Opposition Leader [[Norman Manley]]. He was elected the youngest ever Vice President of the [[People's National Party]] later that year at age 33.<ref>https://nlj.gov.jm/biographies/rt-hon-percival-james-patterson-1935/ Retrieved 29 March 2019.</ref>\n\nWhen in 1969 his predecessor as Prime Minister of Jamaica, [[Michael Manley]], launched his campaign for the Presidency of the PNP, he turned to P. J. Patterson, youngest of the highest-ranking segment of the party executive, to lead his campaign. This was the beginning of a partnership which endured over the next 23 years, and allowed for an exchange of political ideas and perspectives that proved beneficial to both.\n\nPatterson was elected the Member of Parliament for Westmoreland South Eastern in the constituency's by-election of 1970. The constituency borders were reorganized prior to the [[1993 Jamaican general election|general election of 1993]] and he was elected as the Member of Parliament for Westmoreland Eastern in that election, a seat he held until his retirement in 2006.\n\nHe was Campaign Manager for the [[Peoples National Party|People's National Party]]'s bid for power in the General Elections of 1972, demonstrating skill as a political organizer that played a significant role in the party's victory at the polls that year. This led to his first appointment to the Jamaican Cabinet as Minister of Industry, Trade and Tourism. From 1978-1980, Patterson served as deputy prime minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade.<ref>https://nlj.gov.jm/biographies/rt-hon-percival-james-patterson-1935/ Retrieved 29 March 2019.</ref>\n\nThe PNP were voted out of power in 1980, and Patterson lost his seat to Euphemia Williams. However, in 1983, he was elected party chairman, and the PNP won by a landslide in 1989, and Patterson was back as deputy prime minister. From 1989-1990, Patterson was also Minister of Development, Planning and Production, and from 1990-1, he was Minister of Finance and Planning.<ref>https://nlj.gov.jm/biographies/rt-hon-percival-james-patterson-1935/ Retrieved 29 March 2019.</ref>\n\n==Premiership==\nHe assumed office as Prime Minister after [[Michael Manley]] retired in 1992, at a time when the Caribbean island nation was facing the formidable challenge of securing a place in a new global order of economic [[liberalization]] and [[deregulation]]. In 1993, Patterson led the PNP to a second consecutive victory in the polls, winning 52 of the 60 seats up for grabs.<ref>https://nlj.gov.jm/biographies/rt-hon-percival-james-patterson-1935/ Retrieved 29 March 2019.</ref>\n\nPatterson led efforts to strengthen the country's social protection and security systems\u2014a critical element of his economic and social policy agenda to mitigate, reduce poverty and social deprivation.<ref>Franklyn, Delano (ed.): 2002.

The PNP won 50 of the 60 seats available.\n\nHis massive investments in modernization of Jamaica's [[infrastructure]] and restructuring of the country's financial sector are widely credited with having led to Jamaica's greatest period of investment in tourism, mining, [[Information and communication technologies|ICT]] and energy since the 1960s. He also ended Jamaica's 18-year borrowing relationship with the [[International Monetary Fund]],<ref>[http://www.imf.org/external/country/jam/index.htm Jamaica and the IMF.]</ref> allowing the country greater latitude in pursuit of its economic policies. In 2002, when Patterson led the PNP to another general election victory, but with a much-reduced majority of 34 out of 60 seats.

Patterson arranged for Aristide to take up temporary residence in Jamaica during Aristide's lawsuit against the United States and France accusing the countries of kidnapping him.\n\nIn one of his final initiatives as Prime Minister, he launched a program of radical transformation of the island's [[education]] system aimed at development of quality human capital equipped to succeed in the competitive [[globalization|global economy]].<ref>Franklyn, Delano (ed.), 2002.

These have helped to shape north-south relationship and influence the negotiating position of developing countries.\n\nHe is a member of the [[Global Leadership Foundation]], an [[NGO]] composed of a number of former statesmen, ex-presidents and Prime Ministers founded in 2004 by former State President of [[South Africa]] and [[Nobel Prize]] laureate [[F. W. de Klerk]].  The Global Leadership Foundation is an organization which works to support democratic leadership, prevent and resolve conflict through mediation and promote good governance in the form of democratic institutions, open markets, human rights and the rule of law. It does so by making available, discreetly and in confidence, the experience of former leaders to today's national leaders. It is a not-for-profit organization composed of former heads of government, senior governmental and international organization officials who work closely with Heads of Government on governance-related issues of concern to them.\n\nHe played a seminal role in the process that marked the transition from the first steps in integration of the Caribbean region to the founding of CARIFTA and its evolution into [[CARICOM]]. He drew upon his expertise in law and trade, to steer the regional body toward the development of a Caribbean jurisprudence through the [[Caribbean Court of Justice]], and a borderless regional economy through the [[CARICOM Single Market]], which came to fruition in 2005 and 2006 respectively.\n\nDuring his tenure as Jamaica's Foreign Minister he served as President of the [[African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States|ACP]]/[[European Union|EU]] Ministerial Council and led negotiations for the [[African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States|ACP]] group of countries with the European Community. As Chairman of the ACP/EEC Ministerial Conference, he played a pivotal role in forging an agreement on the basic framework for the original [[Lom\u00e9 Convention]], which influenced the outcome of subsequent negotiations that led to the Convention signed in 1975. He has served as President and Spokesman of the ACP Ministerial Council on a number of occasions.\n\nA passionate opponent of [[apartheid]], he was an ardent proponent of [[South Africa]]'s liberation movement.\n\n==Memberships and awards==\nUpon becoming the Prime Minister of Jamaica in 1992 Patterson was invested with the [[Order of the Nation]], allowing him to be known as \"The Most Honourable\" and to use the post-nominal letters \"ON\".\n\nIn 2006 he was invested with the [[Order of Excellence of Guyana]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20070807150647/http://www.op.gov.gy/stories/060529.html] allowing him to use the post-nominal letters \"OE\".
