According to [[Louis Duchesne]], the establishment of a see at Soissons dates from about 300.\n\nThe territory of Soissons and Laon played an important political part under the [[Merovingians]]. After the death of [[Clovis I|Clovis]] (511), Soissons was the capital of one of the four kingdoms into which his states were divided. The [[Kingdom of Soissons]], which ceased to exist in 558, when [[Clotaire I]] reunited all the [[Franks|Frankish]] states, came into being again in 561 when the death of Clotaire led to a redivision of the territory. It finally disappeared in 613 when the Frankish lands were once more reunited under [[Clotaire II]].\n\nIt was re-established by the [[Concordat of 1802]] as suffragan of [[Paris]], but in 1821 it became [[suffragan]] of [[Reims]]. It consists of\n\n*all the ancient Diocese of Soissons, except the civil district of [[Compi\u00e8gne]], which went to the [[Diocese of Beauvais]]\n*all of the [[Diocese of Laon]], except two parishes, which went to [[Reims]]\n*that portion of [[Vermandois]] which formerly belonged to the [[Diocese of Noyon]]\n*a few parishes which formerly belonged to [[Cambrai]], [[Meaux]], [[Troyes]], Reims.\n\n==See of Laon==\n{{main|Ancient diocese of Laon}}\n\n==Bishops of Soissons==\n\nThe Bishop of Soissons as senior suffragan of Reims had the privilege, during a vacancy of the metropolitan see, to replace the archbishop at the ceremony of anointing a King of France.

He was imprisoned from June to August 1793. He returned to parish life, and on 14 December 1799 was elected Constitutional Bishop of Seine-Inf\u00e9rieure (Rouen); he was consecrated bishop on 18 January 1800 by Constitutional Bishop Royer. He submitted his resignation to Cardinal Caprara, the Papal Legate, on 15 October 1801.  On 9 April 1802 he was appointed by arr\u00eat of First Consul Bonaparte to the diocese of Soissons, but on 16 April, at a meeting of several constitutional bishops with Cardinal Caprara, he refused to sign a statement disavowing his past conduct. On 29 June 1804 he wrote to [[Pope Pius VII]] proclaiming his submission and his regrets for the past.  On 5 July 1804 he was named to the Legion of Honor.

[[Hilduin]], abbot (822\u201330) in 826 obtained from [[Pope Eugene II]] relics of [[St. Sebastian]] and [[St. Gregory the Great]]; he caused the relics of [[St. Godard]] and [[St. Remi]] to be transferred to the abbey; he rebuilt the church which was consecrated 27 August, 841, in the presence of [[Charles the Bald]] and seventy-two prelates. The king bore the body of St. M\u00e9dard into the new basilica.  In 853 Charles the Bald presided over the Council of Soissons at Saint-Medard, in the company of fifty-one bishops.  Bishop Rothadus of Soissons was deposed, due to the malevolence of Archbishop Hincmar of Reims, but restored on orders of [[Pope Nicholas I]].<ref>Fisquet, pp. 150-154.</ref>\n\nThe church was pulled down but rebuilt and reconsecrated in 1131 by [[Pope Innocent II]], who granted those visiting the church indulgences known as \"St. M\u00e9dard's pardons\". In this abbey [[Louis the Pious]] was imprisoned in 833, and there he underwent a public penance. Among the abbots of St. M\u00e9dard's are: [[St. Arnoul]], who in 1081 became Bishop of Soissons; [[Gerald of Sauve-Majeure|St. Gerard]] (close of the eleventh century); [[Cardinal de Bernis]], made commendatory abbot of St. M\u00e9dard in 1756.\n\nThe Benedictine Abbey of Note Dame de Soissons was founded in 660 by [[Ebroin]] and his wife Leutrude. The Cistercian abbey of [[Longpont]], founded in 1131, counted among its monks the theologian [[Pierre Cantor]], who died in 1197, and Blessed [[John de Montmirail]] (1167\u20131217), who abandoned the court of [[Phillipe-Auguste]] in order to become a monk.\n\nThe abbey of St. Vincent at Laon was founded in 580 by Queen Brunehaut. Among its earlier monks were: St. Gobain, who, through love of solitude, retired to a desert place near Oise and was slain there; St. Chagnoaldus, afterward Bishop of Laon, who wished to die in his monastery; St. Humbert, first abbot of Maroilles in Hainaut. The abbey adopted the rule of St. Benedict. It was reformed in 961 by Blessed Malcaleine, a Scotchman, abbot of St. Michael at Thierache, and in 1643 by the Benedictines of St. Maur. Among the abbots of St. Vincent were: St. Gerard (close of the eleventh century), who wrote the history of St. Adelard, abbot of Corde; Jean de Nouelles (d. 1396), who wrote a history of the world, and began the cartulary of his monastery. The Abbey of St. John at Laon was founded in 650 by St. Salaberga, who built seven churches there; she was its first abbess; St. Austruda (d. 688) succeeded her. In 1128 the abbey became a Benedictine monastery. The Abbey of Nogent sous Coucy was founded in 1076 by Alb\u00e9ric, Lord of Coucy. Among its abbots were St. Geoffroy (end of the eleventh century) and the historian Guibert de Nogent, who died in 1112, and whose autobiography, \"De Vita Sua\" is one of the most interesting documents of the century. Under the title \"Gesta Dei per Francos\" he wrote an account of the First Crusade.\n\nThe Abbey of Cuissy in the Diocese of Laon was founded in 1116 by Blessed [[Lucas de Roucy]], dean of Laon, and followed the rule of [[Premonstratensians]]. In the Diocese of Soissons, the Premonstratensians had the abbeys: Chartreuve, Valsery, [[Saint-Yved de Braine]], Villers Cotterets, Val Secret, Vauchr\u00e9tien, Lieurestaur\u00e9.\n\nThe portion of the ancient [[Diocese of Noyon]] within the jurisdiction of the present Diocese of Soissons includes the town, St-Quentin (Augusta Vermanduorum) where St-Quentin was martyred under Diocletian. It was the chief town of a diocese until 532, when St. M\u00e9dard, the titular, removed the see to Noyon. Abbott Fulrade built the Church of St-Quentin in the eighth century and Pope Stephan II blessed it (816). From the time of Charles Martel until 771, and again from 844 the abbots of St-Quentin were laymen and counts of Vermandois. The abbey church became the [[Saint-Quentin Basilica]], built from the 12th to 15th centuries. During the Middle Ages a distinct type of religious architecture sprang up in Soissons; Eug\u00e9ne Lef\u00e8vre Pontalis has recently brought out a work dealing with its artistic affiliations. After investigation Canon Bauxin concludes that the cathedral of Laon, as it exists, is not the one consecrated in 1114 and visited by Innocent II in 1132; that was the restored ancient Romanesque building; the present one was built 1150\u20131225. Louyis d'Outremer (936), Robert the Pious (996), [[Philip I of France|Philip I]] (1059) were anointed in Notre Dame de Laon; in the twelfth century Hermann, Abbot of St. Martin's of Tournai, wrote a volume on the miracles of Notre Dame of Laon. The H\u00f4tel-Dieu of Laon, once known as H\u00f4tellerie Notre Dame, was founded in 1019 by the Laon chapter. The H\u00f4tel-Dieu of Ch\u00e2teau Thierry was founded in 1304 by Jeanne, wife of Philip the Fair.\n\n==Saints==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}\nThe following are honoured as connected with the religious history of the diocese: [[St. Marculfus]], Abbot of [[Nanteuil]] (sixth century) in the [[Diocese of Coutances]], whose relics, transferred to [[Corbeny]] in the [[Diocese of Laon]], were visited by the kings of France who, after their anointing at Reims, were wont to go to the tomb of St. Marculfus to cure the [[king's evil]].\n\nAmong the natives of the diocese may be mentioned: [[Petrus Ramus]] (1515\u201372), [[Jean Racine]] (1639\u201399), [[La Fontaine]] (1621\u201395), Dom [[Luc d'Achery]] (1609\u20131685), [[Charlevoix]] (1683\u20131761), [[Camille Desmoulins]] (1760\u20131794).{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nBefore the application of the Congregations Law (1901), there were in the Diocese of Soissons Jesuits, Trinitarians, and several teaching congregations of brothers. Some congregations of women had their origin in the diocese: the Nursing and Teaching Sisters of the Child Jesus, with mother-house at Soissons, founded in 1714 by the Madame Brulard de Genlis; the Sisters of Notre Dame de Bon Secours, a nursing and teaching order, founded in 1806, with mother-house at Charly; Sisters of Notre Dame, nursing and teaching order, with mother-house at Saint-Erme, founded in 1820 by the Abb\u00e9 Chr\u00e9tien; the Franciscan nuns of the Sacred Heart, a nursing order, founded in 1867, with mother-house at St-Quentin; the Servants of the Heart of Jesus, of whom there are two branches, the \"Marys\" who lead a contemplative life, and the \"Marthas\" who nurse the sick; they were founded at Strasburg in 1867, and brought to St-Quentin after the war of 1870\u20131.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Councils of Soissons]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Books==\n===Reference works===\n*{{cite book|last=Gams|first=Pius Bonifatius |title=Series episcoporum Ecclesiae catholicae: quotquot innotuerunt a beato Petro apostolo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=os9DAQAAMAAJ|year=1873|publisher=Typis et Sumptibus Georgii Josephi Manz|location=Ratisbon}} (Use with caution; obsolete)\n*{{cite book|last1=Eubel|first1=Conradus (ed.)|title=Hierarchia catholica, Tomus 1|date=1913|publisher=Libreria Regensbergiana|location=M\u00fcnster|edition=second|url=https://archive.org/details/hierarchiacathol01eubeuoft}}  (in Latin) \n*{{cite book|last1=Eubel|first1=Conradus (ed.)|title=Hierarchia catholica, Tomus 2|date=1914|publisher=Libreria Regensbergiana|location=M\u00fcnster|edition=second|url=https://archive.org/details/hierarchiacathol02eubeuoft}} (in Latin) \n*{{cite book|last1=Eubel|first1=Conradus (ed.)|last2=Gulik|first2=Guilelmus|title=Hierarchia catholica, Tomus 3|date=1923|publisher=Libreria Regensbergiana|location=M\u00fcnster|edition=second|url=https://archive.org/details/hierarchiacathol02eubeuoft}} \n*{{cite book|last1=Gauchat|first1=Patritius (Patrice)|title=Hierarchia catholica  IV (1592-1667)|date=1935|publisher=Libraria Regensbergiana|location=M\u00fcnster|url=https://archive.org/details/hierarchiacathol04eubeuoft|accessdate=2016-07-06}} \n*{{cite book|last1=Ritzler|first1=Remigius|last2=Sefrin|first2=Pirminus|title=Hierarchia catholica medii et recentis aevi  V (1667-1730)|date=1952|publisher=Messagero di S.

[[Hilduin]], abbot (822\u201330) in 826 obtained from [[Pope Eugene II]] relics of [[St. Sebastian]] and [[St. Gregory the Great]]; he caused the relics of [[St. Godard]] and [[St. Remi]] to be transferred to the abbey; he rebuilt the church which was consecrated 27 August, 841, in the presence of [[Charles the Bald]] and seventy-two prelates. The king bore the body of St. M\u00e9dard into the new basilica.  In 853 Charles the Bald presided over the Council of Soissons at Saint-Medard, in the company of fifty-one bishops.  Bishop Rothadus of Soissons was deposed, due to the malevolence of Archbishop Hincmar of Reims, but restored on orders of [[Pope Nicholas I]].<ref>Fisquet, pp. 150-154.</ref>\n\nThe church was pulled down but rebuilt and reconsecrated in 1131 by [[Pope Innocent II]], who granted those visiting the church indulgences known as \"St. M\u00e9dard's pardons\". In this abbey [[Louis the Pious]] was imprisoned in 833, and there he underwent a public penance. Among the abbots of St. M\u00e9dard's are: [[St. Arnoul]], who in 1081 became Bishop of Soissons; [[Gerald of Sauve-Majeure|St. Gerard]] (close of the eleventh century); [[Cardinal de Bernis]], made commendatory abbot of St. M\u00e9dard in 1756.\n\nThe Benedictine Abbey of Note Dame de Soissons was founded in 660 by [[Ebroin]] and his wife Leutrude. The Cistercian abbey of [[Longpont]], founded in 1131, counted among its monks the theologian [[Pierre Cantor]], who died in 1197, and Blessed [[John de Montmirail]] (1167\u20131217), who abandoned the court of [[Phillipe-Auguste]] in order to become a monk.\n\nThe abbey of St. Vincent at Laon was founded in 580 by Queen Brunehaut. Among its earlier monks were: St. Gobain, who, through love of solitude, retired to a desert place near Oise and was slain there; St. Chagnoaldus, afterward Bishop of Laon, who wished to die in his monastery; St. Humbert, first abbot of Maroilles in Hainaut. The abbey adopted the rule of St. Benedict. It was reformed in 961 by Blessed Malcaleine, a Scotchman, abbot of St. Michael at Thierache, and in 1643 by the Benedictines of St. Maur. Among the abbots of St. Vincent were: St. Gerard (close of the eleventh century), who wrote the history of St. Adelard, abbot of Corde; Jean de Nouelles (d. 1396), who wrote a history of the world, and began the cartulary of his monastery. The Abbey of St. John at Laon was founded in 650 by St. Salaberga, who built seven churches there; she was its first abbess; St. Austruda (d. 688) succeeded her. In 1128 the abbey became a Benedictine monastery. The Abbey of Nogent sous Coucy was founded in 1076 by Alb\u00e9ric, Lord of Coucy. Among its abbots were St. Geoffroy (end of the eleventh century) and the historian Guibert de Nogent, who died in 1112, and whose autobiography, \"De Vita Sua\" is one of the most interesting documents of the century. Under the title \"Gesta Dei per Francos\" he wrote an account of the First Crusade.\n\nThe Abbey of Cuissy in the Diocese of Laon was founded in 1116 by Blessed [[Lucas de Roucy]], dean of Laon, and followed the rule of [[Premonstratensians]]. In the Diocese of Soissons, the Premonstratensians had the abbeys: Chartreuve, Valsery, [[Saint-Yved de Braine]], Villers Cotterets, Val Secret, Vauchr\u00e9tien, Lieurestaur\u00e9.\n\nThe portion of the ancient [[Diocese of Noyon]] within the jurisdiction of the present Diocese of Soissons includes the town, St-Quentin (Augusta Vermanduorum) where St-Quentin was martyred under Diocletian. It was the chief town of a diocese until 532, when St. M\u00e9dard, the titular, removed the see to Noyon. Abbott Fulrade built the Church of St-Quentin in the eighth century and Pope Stephan II blessed it (816). From the time of Charles Martel until 771, and again from 844 the abbots of St-Quentin were laymen and counts of Vermandois. The abbey church became the [[Saint-Quentin Basilica]], built from the 12th to 15th centuries. During the Middle Ages a distinct type of religious architecture sprang up in Soissons; Eug\u00e9ne Lef\u00e8vre Pontalis has recently brought out a work dealing with its artistic affiliations. After investigation Canon Bauxin concludes that the cathedral of Laon, as it exists, is not the one consecrated in 1114 and visited by Innocent II in 1132; that was the restored ancient Romanesque building; the present one was built 1150\u20131225. Louyis d'Outremer (936), Robert the Pious (996), [[Philip I of France|Philip I]] (1059) were anointed in Notre Dame de Laon; in the twelfth century Hermann, Abbot of St. Martin's of Tournai, wrote a volume on the miracles of Notre Dame of Laon. The H\u00f4tel-Dieu of Laon, once known as H\u00f4tellerie Notre Dame, was founded in 1019 by the Laon chapter. The H\u00f4tel-Dieu of Ch\u00e2teau Thierry was founded in 1304 by Jeanne, wife of Philip the Fair.\n\n==Saints==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}\nThe following are honoured as connected with the religious history of the diocese: [[St. Marculfus]], Abbot of [[Nanteuil]] (sixth century) in the [[Diocese of Coutances]], whose relics, transferred to [[Corbeny]] in the [[Diocese of Laon]], were visited by the kings of France who, after their anointing at Reims, were wont to go to the tomb of St. Marculfus to cure the [[king's evil]].\n\nAmong the natives of the diocese may be mentioned: [[Petrus Ramus]] (1515\u201372), [[Jean Racine]] (1639\u201399), [[La Fontaine]] (1621\u201395), Dom [[Luc d'Achery]] (1609\u20131685), [[Charlevoix]] (1683\u20131761), [[Camille Desmoulins]] (1760\u20131794).{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nBefore the application of the Congregations Law (1901), there were in the Diocese of Soissons Jesuits, Trinitarians, and several teaching congregations of brothers. Some congregations of women had their origin in the diocese: the Nursing and Teaching Sisters of the Child Jesus, with mother-house at Soissons, founded in 1714 by the Madame Brulard de Genlis; the Sisters of Notre Dame de Bon Secours, a nursing and teaching order, founded in 1806, with mother-house at Charly; Sisters of Notre Dame, nursing and teaching order, with mother-house at Saint-Erme, founded in 1820 by the Abb\u00e9 Chr\u00e9tien; the Franciscan nuns of the Sacred Heart, a nursing order, founded in 1867, with mother-house at St-Quentin; the Servants of the Heart of Jesus, of whom there are two branches, the \"Marys\" who lead a contemplative life, and the \"Marthas\" who nurse the sick; they were founded at Strasburg in 1867, and brought to St-Quentin after the war of 1870\u20131.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Councils of Soissons]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Books==\n===Reference works===\n*{{cite book|last=Gams|first=Pius Bonifatius |title=Series episcoporum Ecclesiae catholicae: quotquot innotuerunt a beato Petro apostolo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=os9DAQAAMAAJ|year=1873|publisher=Typis et Sumptibus Georgii Josephi Manz|location=Ratisbon}} (Use with caution; obsolete)\n*{{cite book|last1=Eubel|first1=Conradus (ed.)|title=Hierarchia catholica, Tomus 1|date=1913|publisher=Libreria Regensbergiana|location=M\u00fcnster|edition=second|url=https://archive.org/details/hierarchiacathol01eubeuoft}}  (in Latin) \n*{{cite book|last1=Eubel|first1=Conradus (ed.)|title=Hierarchia catholica, Tomus 2|date=1914|publisher=Libreria Regensbergiana|location=M\u00fcnster|edition=second|url=https://archive.org/details/hierarchiacathol02eubeuoft}} (in Latin) \n*{{cite book|last1=Eubel|first1=Conradus (ed.)|last2=Gulik|first2=Guilelmus|title=Hierarchia catholica, Tomus 3|date=1923|publisher=Libreria Regensbergiana|location=M\u00fcnster|edition=second|url=https://archive.org/details/hierarchiacathol02eubeuoft}} \n*{{cite book|last1=Gauchat|first1=Patritius (Patrice)|title=Hierarchia catholica  IV (1592-1667)|date=1935|publisher=Libraria Regensbergiana|location=M\u00fcnster|url=https://archive.org/details/hierarchiacathol04eubeuoft|accessdate=2016-07-06}} \n*{{cite book|last1=Ritzler|first1=Remigius|last2=Sefrin|first2=Pirminus|title=Hierarchia catholica medii et recentis aevi  V (1667-1730)|date=1952|publisher=Messagero di S.

It ranges across [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] extending into the United States portion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It is characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the [[bobcat]] (''L. rufus''), the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The Canada lynx stands {{convert|48|\u2013|56|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder and weighs between {{convert|5|and|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. This lynx was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in 1792. Three [[subspecies]] are recognized.\n\nThe Canada lynx is typically [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] like its primary prey, the [[snowshoe hare]]. The lynx is a good swimmer and an agile climber. Individuals of the same sex particularly tend to avoid each other, forming \"intrasexual\" territories. The strong dependence of this [[Specialist and generalist species|specialist predator]] on snowshoe hares for food leads to an example of a prey-predator cycle. Canada lynxes respond to the cyclic rises and falls over the years in snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada\u2014when hares are scarce lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares and tend to not produce litters, and as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx. The lynx waits for the hare in specific trails or \"ambush beds\", then pounces on it and kill it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck. The mating season is roughly a month long (from March to early April). After a gestational period of two to three months, a litter of one to eight kittens is born.

Females reach sexual maturity at ten months, although they often delay breeding for another year, whereas males reach maturity at two or three years.

Canada lynxes shun open areas despite good prey availability; they face difficulty surviving in heavily logged areas and agricultural land, though they can thrive well in deforested areas which have been left to regenerate for 15 years or more. In the past the lynx occurred from the northern United States (in 24 States), possibly up to the [[Rocky Mountains]] in [[New Mexico]], to the [[tree line]] in the Arctic through coniferous forests in Alaska and Canada. The lynx continues to occur in most of Alaska and its erstwhile range in Canada. In the United States, the lynx occurs in the  [[Blue Mountains (Pacific Northwest)|Blue Mountains]], [[Cascade Range]] and southern Rocky Mountains, [[Great Lakes region]] and [[New England]]. The lynx has been successfully reintroduced in [[Colorado]], where it had become extinct in the 1970s.

To avoid severe population declines during the periodic fall in lynx populations, Alaska and most Canadian provinces regulate the time periods and fur quantity for trapping. Even without regulations in place, the lynx-hare cycles and the distribution of the lynx have remained unaffected over the last century. In eastern Canada the lynx is threatened by competition with the [[eastern coyote]], whose numbers in the region have rose in the last few decades.

It ranges across [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] extending into the United States portion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It is characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the [[bobcat]] (''L. rufus''), the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The Canada lynx stands {{convert|48|\u2013|56|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder and weighs between {{convert|5|and|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. This lynx was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in 1792. Three [[subspecies]] are recognized.\n\nThe Canada lynx is typically [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] like its primary prey, the [[snowshoe hare]]. The lynx is a good swimmer and an agile climber. Individuals of the same sex particularly tend to avoid each other, forming \"intrasexual\" territories. The strong dependence of this [[Specialist and generalist species|specialist predator]] on snowshoe hares for food leads to an example of a prey-predator cycle. Canada lynxes respond to the cyclic rises and falls over the years in snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada\u2014when hares are scarce lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares and tend to not produce litters, and as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx. The lynx waits for the hare in specific trails or \"ambush beds\", then pounces on it and kill it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck. The mating season is roughly a month long (from March to early April). After a gestational period of two to three months, a litter of one to eight kittens is born. Offspring are weaned at 12 weeks.\n\nThis lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Given its abundance throughout its range and no severe threats, this lynx has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]. This lynx is regularly trapped for the international fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada, but is protected in the southern half of its range due to threats such as habitat loss.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIn his 1792 work ''The Animal Kingdom'', Scottish scientific writer [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] [[Scientific description|described]] a [[Lynx (genus)|lynx]] from Canada, giving it the [[Binomial nomenclature|name]] ''Felis lynx canadensis''.<ref name=\"Kerr1792\">{{cite book |last1=Kerr |first1=R. |authorlink=Robert Kerr (writer) |title=The Animal Kingdom |date=1792 |publisher=A.

From the moment of formation, Airbus had begun studies into derivatives of the Airbus A300B in support of this long-term goal.<ref>{{harvnb|Wensveen|2007|page=63}}</ref> Prior to the service introduction of the first Airbus airliners, Airbus had identified nine possible variations of the A300 known as A300B1 to B9.<ref name=\"gunston2009\">{{harvnb|Gunston|2009}}</ref> A tenth variation, conceived in 1973, later the first to be constructed, was designated the A300B10.<ref name=\"N&W p.18\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=18}}</ref> It was a smaller aircraft that would be developed into the long-range [[Airbus A310]]. Airbus then focused its efforts on the single-aisle market, which resulted in the [[Airbus A320 family]], which was the first digital [[fly-by-wire]] commercial aircraft. The decision to work on the A320, instead of a four-engine aircraft proposed by the Germans, created divisions within Airbus.<ref name=\"N&W p.18\"/> As the SA or \"single aisle\" studies (which later became the successful Airbus A320) underwent development to challenge the successful [[Boeing 737]] and [[Douglas DC-9]] in the single-aisle, [[Narrow-body aircraft|narrow-body airliner]] market, Airbus turned its focus back to the [[wide-body aircraft]] market.\n\nThe A300B11,<ref name=\"Eden p.30\"/> a derivative of the A310, was designed upon the availability of \"ten ton\" thrust engines.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=23}}</ref> Using four engines, it would seat between 180 and 200 passengers, and have a range of {{Convert|6000|nmi|km}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=59}}</ref> It was deemed a replacement for the less-efficient [[Boeing 707]]s and [[Douglas DC-8]]s still in service.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\"/> The A300B11 was joined by another design, the A300B9, which was a larger derivative of the A300. The B9 was developed by Airbus from the early 1970s at a slow pace until the early 1980s. It was essentially a stretched A300 with the same wing, coupled with the most powerful [[turbofan engine]] available at the time.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\"/> It was targeted at the growing demand for high-capacity, medium-range, transcontinental trunk routes.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\"/> The B9 offered the same [[Range (aircraft)|range]] and payload as the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]], but it used between 25%<ref name=\"N&W p.23\"/> to 38%<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/11/business/11air.html?_r=1|title=To Save Fuel, Airlines Find No Speck Too Small|work=The New York Times|last=Maynard|first=Micheline|date=11 June 2008}}</ref> less fuel.

Airbus vice president for strategic planning, Adam Brown, recalled,\n<blockquote>North American operators were clearly in favour of a twin[jet], while Asians wanted a quad[jet]. In Europe, opinion was split between the two. The majority of potential customers were in favour of a quad despite the fact, in certain conditions, it is more costly to operate than a twin.

Studies were carried out by [[British Aerospace]] (BAe) at [[Hatfield, Hertfordshire|Hatfield]] and [[Bristol]]. Airbus estimated this would yield a 2% improvement in aerodynamic efficiency.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=26}}</ref> However, the plan was later abandoned on grounds of cost and difficulty of development.<ref name=\"Eden p.30\"/>\n\nAirbus had held discussions with [[McDonnell Douglas]] to jointly produce the aircraft, which would have been designated as the ''AM 300''.<ref name=\"N&W p.28\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=28}}</ref> This aeroplane would have combined the wing of the A330 with the fuselage of the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]].<ref name=\"N&W p.28\"/> However, talks were terminated as McDonnell Douglas insisted on the continuation of its [[trijet]] heritage.<ref name=\"auto\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=67}}</ref> Although from the start it was intended that the A340 would be powered by four [[CFM56]]-5 [[turbofan engine]]s, each capable of {{Convert|25000|lbf|kN}},<ref>{{harvnb|Gunston|2009|p=201}}</ref> Airbus had also considered developing the aircraft as a trijet due to the limited power of engines available at the time, namely the [[Rolls-Royce RB211]]-535 and [[Pratt & Whitney JT10D]]-232<ref>{{harnvb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=36}}</ref> (redesignated PW2000 in December 1980).\n\nAs refinements in the A340's design proceeded, a radical new engine option was offered by International Aero Engines, a group comprising Rolls-Royce, [[Pratt & Whitney]], [[Japanese Aero Engines Corporation]], [[Fiat]] and [[MTU Aero Engines]] (MTU). The [[Nacelle|engine nacelles]] of the superfan engine consisted of provisions to allow a large fan near the rear of the engine. As a result of the superfan cancellation by IAE, the [[CFM56]]-5C4 was used as the sole engine choice instead of there being an alternate option as originally envisioned. The longer-range versions, namely the A340-500 and -600, are powered by [[Rolls-Royce Trent 500]] engines.\n\nOn 27 January 1986, the Airbus Industrie Supervisory Board held a meeting in [[Munich]], [[West Germany]], after which board-chairman [[Franz Josef Strau\u00df]] released a statement, \"Airbus Industrie is now in a position to finalise the detailed technical definition of the TA9, which is now officially designated the A330, and the TA11, now called the A340, with potential launch customer airlines, and to discuss with them the terms and conditions for launch commitments\".<ref name=\"N&W p.27\"/> The designations were originally reversed because the airlines believed it illogical for a [[Twinjet|two-engine]] jet airliner to have a \"4\" in its name, whilst a quad-jet would not. On 12 May 1986, Airbus dispatched fresh sale proposals to five prospective airlines including [[Lufthansa]] and [[Swissair]].<ref name=\"N&W p.27\"/>\n\n===Production and testing===\nIn preparations for production of the A330/A340, Airbus's partners invested heavily in new facilities. [[Filton]] was the site of BAE's [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]7&nbsp;million investment in a three-storey technical centre with an extra {{Convert|15000|m2|sqft}} of floor area.<ref name=\"N&W p.51\">{{harnvb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=51}}</ref> BAe also spent \u00a35&nbsp;million expanding the [[Broughton, Flintshire|Broughton]] wing production plant by {{cvt|14000|m2|sqft}}<ref name=\"N&W p.51\"/> to accommodate a new production line. However, France saw the biggest changes with [[A\u00e9rospatiale]] starting construction of a new [[French franc|Fr.]]2.5&nbsp;billion ($411&nbsp;million) assembly plant, adjacent to [[Toulouse-Blagnac Airport]], in [[Colomiers]].<ref name=\"N&W p.52\">{{harnvb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=52}}</ref> By November 1988, the first {{cvt|21|m|ft|adj=on}} pillars were erected for the new ''[[Cl\u00e9ment Ader]]'' assembly hall.<ref name=\"N&W p.52\"/> The assembly process, meanwhile, would feature increased automation with holes for the wing-fuselage mating process drilled by eight robots.<ref name=\"N&W p.53\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=53}}</ref> The use of automation for this particular process saved Airbus 20% on labour costs and 5% on time.<ref name=\"N&W p.53\"/>\n\n[[File:Airbus A340-211, Airbus Industrie AN0726637.jpg|thumb|An A340-200 demonstrator at the 1992 [[Farnborough Air Show]]]]\nBritish Aerospace accepted \u00a3450&nbsp;million funding from the UK government, short of the \u00a3750&nbsp;million originally requested.<ref name=\"N&W p.32\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=32}}</ref> Funds from the French and German governments followed thereafter.

From the moment of formation, Airbus had begun studies into derivatives of the Airbus A300B in support of this long-term goal.<ref>{{harvnb|Wensveen|2007|page=63}}</ref> Prior to the service introduction of the first Airbus airliners, Airbus had identified nine possible variations of the A300 known as A300B1 to B9.<ref name=\"gunston2009\">{{harvnb|Gunston|2009}}</ref> A tenth variation, conceived in 1973, later the first to be constructed, was designated the A300B10.<ref name=\"N&W p.18\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=18}}</ref> It was a smaller aircraft that would be developed into the long-range [[Airbus A310]]. Airbus then focused its efforts on the single-aisle market, which resulted in the [[Airbus A320 family]], which was the first digital [[fly-by-wire]] commercial aircraft. The decision to work on the A320, instead of a four-engine aircraft proposed by the Germans, created divisions within Airbus.<ref name=\"N&W p.18\"/> As the SA or \"single aisle\" studies (which later became the successful Airbus A320) underwent development to challenge the successful [[Boeing 737]] and [[Douglas DC-9]] in the single-aisle, [[Narrow-body aircraft|narrow-body airliner]] market, Airbus turned its focus back to the [[wide-body aircraft]] market.\n\nThe A300B11,<ref name=\"Eden p.30\"/> a derivative of the A310, was designed upon the availability of \"ten ton\" thrust engines.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=23}}</ref> Using four engines, it would seat between 180 and 200 passengers, and have a range of {{Convert|6000|nmi|km}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=59}}</ref> It was deemed a replacement for the less-efficient [[Boeing 707]]s and [[Douglas DC-8]]s still in service.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\"/> The A300B11 was joined by another design, the A300B9, which was a larger derivative of the A300. The B9 was developed by Airbus from the early 1970s at a slow pace until the early 1980s. It was essentially a stretched A300 with the same wing, coupled with the most powerful [[turbofan engine]] available at the time.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\"/> It was targeted at the growing demand for high-capacity, medium-range, transcontinental trunk routes.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\"/> The B9 offered the same [[Range (aircraft)|range]] and payload as the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]], but it used between 25%<ref name=\"N&W p.23\"/> to 38%<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/11/business/11air.html?_r=1|title=To Save Fuel, Airlines Find No Speck Too Small|work=The New York Times|last=Maynard|first=Micheline|date=11 June 2008}}</ref> less fuel.

Airbus vice president for strategic planning, Adam Brown, recalled,\n<blockquote>North American operators were clearly in favour of a twin[jet], while Asians wanted a quad[jet]. In Europe, opinion was split between the two. The majority of potential customers were in favour of a quad despite the fact, in certain conditions, it is more costly to operate than a twin. They liked that it could be ferried with one engine out, and could fly 'anywhere'\u2014 ETOPS (extend-range twin-engine operations) hadn't begun then.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Airbus A330/A340|journal=Flight International|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1997/1997%20-%202917.html|accessdate=26 January 2011|last=Kingsley-Jones|first=Max|date=4 November 1997}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|pp=22\u201323}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Design effort===\nThe first specifications of the TA9 and TA11 were released in 1982.<ref name=\"N&W p.24\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=24}}</ref> While the TA9 had a range of {{convert|3300|nmi|km}}, the TA11 range was up to {{Convert|6830|nmi|km}}.<ref name=\"N&W p.24\"/> At the same time, Airbus also sketched the TA12, a twin-engine derivative of the TA11, which was optimised for flights of a {{Convert|2000|nmi|km}} lesser range.<ref name=\"N&W p.24\"/> By the time of the [[Paris Air Show]] in June 1985, more refinements had been made to the TA9 and TA11, including the adoption of the A320 [[Cockpit|flight deck]], [[fly-by-wire]] (FBW) [[Aircraft flight control system|flight control system]] and [[side-stick]] control.<ref name=\"N&W p.27\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=27}}</ref> Adopting a common cockpit across the new Airbus series allowed operators to make significant cost savings; flight crews would be able to transition from one to another after one week of training.<ref name=\"Lawrence p.73\">{{harvnb|Lawrence|Thornton|2005|p=73}}</ref> The TA11 and TA12 would use the front and rear fuselage sections of the A310.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=24}}</ref> Components were modular and also interchangeable with other Airbus aircraft where possible<ref name=\"Lawrence p.73\"/> to reduce production, maintenance and operating costs.\n\n[[File:A340-642 flight deck.jpg|thumb|The A330/A340 shares a common flight deck with the A320.]]\nAirbus briefly considered a [[variable camber wing]]; the concept was that the wing could change its profile to produce the optimum shape for a given phase of flight. Studies were carried out by [[British Aerospace]] (BAe) at [[Hatfield, Hertfordshire|Hatfield]] and [[Bristol]]. Airbus estimated this would yield a 2% improvement in aerodynamic efficiency.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=26}}</ref> However, the plan was later abandoned on grounds of cost and difficulty of development.<ref name=\"Eden p.30\"/>\n\nAirbus had held discussions with [[McDonnell Douglas]] to jointly produce the aircraft, which would have been designated as the ''AM 300''.<ref name=\"N&W p.28\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=28}}</ref> This aeroplane would have combined the wing of the A330 with the fuselage of the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]].<ref name=\"N&W p.28\"/> However, talks were terminated as McDonnell Douglas insisted on the continuation of its [[trijet]] heritage.<ref name=\"auto\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=67}}</ref> Although from the start it was intended that the A340 would be powered by four [[CFM56]]-5 [[turbofan engine]]s, each capable of {{Convert|25000|lbf|kN}},<ref>{{harvnb|Gunston|2009|p=201}}</ref> Airbus had also considered developing the aircraft as a trijet due to the limited power of engines available at the time, namely the [[Rolls-Royce RB211]]-535 and [[Pratt & Whitney JT10D]]-232<ref>{{harnvb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=36}}</ref> (redesignated PW2000 in December 1980).\n\nAs refinements in the A340's design proceeded, a radical new engine option was offered by International Aero Engines, a group comprising Rolls-Royce, [[Pratt & Whitney]], [[Japanese Aero Engines Corporation]], [[Fiat]] and [[MTU Aero Engines]] (MTU). The [[Nacelle|engine nacelles]] of the superfan engine consisted of provisions to allow a large fan near the rear of the engine. As a result of the superfan cancellation by IAE, the [[CFM56]]-5C4 was used as the sole engine choice instead of there being an alternate option as originally envisioned. The longer-range versions, namely the A340-500 and -600, are powered by [[Rolls-Royce Trent 500]] engines.\n\nOn 27 January 1986, the Airbus Industrie Supervisory Board held a meeting in [[Munich]], [[West Germany]], after which board-chairman [[Franz Josef Strau\u00df]] released a statement, \"Airbus Industrie is now in a position to finalise the detailed technical definition of the TA9, which is now officially designated the A330, and the TA11, now called the A340, with potential launch customer airlines, and to discuss with them the terms and conditions for launch commitments\".<ref name=\"N&W p.27\"/> The designations were originally reversed because the airlines believed it illogical for a [[Twinjet|two-engine]] jet airliner to have a \"4\" in its name, whilst a quad-jet would not. On 12 May 1986, Airbus dispatched fresh sale proposals to five prospective airlines including [[Lufthansa]] and [[Swissair]].<ref name=\"N&W p.27\"/>\n\n===Production and testing===\nIn preparations for production of the A330/A340, Airbus's partners invested heavily in new facilities. [[Filton]] was the site of BAE's [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]7&nbsp;million investment in a three-storey technical centre with an extra {{Convert|15000|m2|sqft}} of floor area.<ref name=\"N&W p.51\">{{harnvb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=51}}</ref> BAe also spent \u00a35&nbsp;million expanding the [[Broughton, Flintshire|Broughton]] wing production plant by {{cvt|14000|m2|sqft}}<ref name=\"N&W p.51\"/> to accommodate a new production line. However, France saw the biggest changes with [[A\u00e9rospatiale]] starting construction of a new [[French franc|Fr.]]2.5&nbsp;billion ($411&nbsp;million) assembly plant, adjacent to [[Toulouse-Blagnac Airport]], in [[Colomiers]].<ref name=\"N&W p.52\">{{harnvb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=52}}</ref> By November 1988, the first {{cvt|21|m|ft|adj=on}} pillars were erected for the new ''[[Cl\u00e9ment Ader]]'' assembly hall.<ref name=\"N&W p.52\"/> The assembly process, meanwhile, would feature increased automation with holes for the wing-fuselage mating process drilled by eight robots.<ref name=\"N&W p.53\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=53}}</ref> The use of automation for this particular process saved Airbus 20% on labour costs and 5% on time.<ref name=\"N&W p.53\"/>\n\n[[File:Airbus A340-211, Airbus Industrie AN0726637.jpg|thumb|An A340-200 demonstrator at the 1992 [[Farnborough Air Show]]]]\nBritish Aerospace accepted \u00a3450&nbsp;million funding from the UK government, short of the \u00a3750&nbsp;million originally requested.<ref name=\"N&W p.32\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=32}}</ref> Funds from the French and German governments followed thereafter.
