[[Thomas Telford]] built a new harbour in the 1820s, and the town expanded and grew into a [[Commuting|commuter]] suburb of Dundee as the prosperous [[jute]] manufacturers, [[industrialist]]s and the [[middle class|middle]] and [[skilled worker|upper working class]] of Dundee established fashionable residences in Newport.\n\nThe local war memorial dates from 1920 and was designed by Sir [[Robert Lorimer]].<ref>Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Robert Lorimer</ref>\n\nNewport-on-Tay formerly had two railway stations \u2013 the [[Newport-on-Tay East railway station|East]] and West stations on what was the [[Newport Railway, Scotland|Newport Railway]]. Both stations (and the Tayport-Dundee branch line) closed in 1969, having lost much of their business following the opening of the Tay Road Bridge in 1966.  In fact, trains had ceased to run beyond Newport-on-Tay East station to Tayport on 22 May 1966 so that the railway line could be breached to build the bridge's southern approach road. The Dundee \u2013 Newport ferry also closed promptly later in 1966 on the opening of the [[Tay Road Bridge]].  However, the ferry terminal buildings and slipways still survive at the foot of Boat Hill as a boat repair yard.\n\n==Archaeology==\n[[File:Dec vessel in-situ 400.jpg|thumb|left|A Bronze Age ceramic accessory vessel in situ]]\nAn excavation carried out by [[Headland Archaeology]]<ref>Stronach, S., Sheridan, A. and D. Henderson (2006), ''Tayside and Fife Archaeological Journal'', 12, pp. 1\u201313.</ref> in the farm of North Straiton near Newport-on-Tay uncovered part of a [[Bronze Age Britain|Bronze Age]] [[cremation]] cemetery and a line of postholes. Five human cremations were found in a group of scattered disposal pits.  Around 25m away was a line of postholes, one of which was also associated with cremated human bone. [[Radiocarbon]] dates from the features indicated that they had been created in the Bronze Age, from around 1700 to 2000 BC.\n\nThe line of posts was substantial and may have been associated with the cremations rather than a building or fence. It is possible that the posts may have been memorials or markers close to the pyre used to burn the dead. Part of a quern stone and some burnt animal bone suggested that the cremation ceremony also involved preparing food. A collection of pottery was found with the cremations. This included a complete accessory vessel and fragments from a larger decorated pot that covered it.\n\n==Present==\nNewport currently has a population of about eight thousand, mostly residing in stone houses built before World War II. The town centre comprises two main streets where may be found a small variety of shops and three public houses.  The town has one primary school, Newport Primary, with older pupils attending secondary school at [[Madras College]] in [[St Andrews]], or at [[Bell Baxter High School]] in [[Cupar]], or at the nearest independent schools, the [[High School of Dundee]] and [[St Leonards School]].\n\nPublic bus routes are the 77 to [[Dundee]], 92 to [[St Andrews]], and the X54 to [[Edinburgh]] via [[Glenrothes]] (and [[Ninewells Hospital]] in the other direction)\n\nNewport has been twinned with [[Zolotarevo]], [[Ukraine]] since 20 July 2002.<ref>{{cite web|title=Town Twinning|url=https://www.fifedirect.org.uk/topics/index.cfm?fuseaction=service.display&objectid=909a83ad-347e-4e30-828c-07b353b68048|website=www.fifedirect.org.uk|accessdate=26 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Local Amenities===\n[[File:Newport East Station (geograph 3190285).jpg|thumb|right|300px|A view of Newport in about 1968 showing the BL Nairn, St. Fillans Church, and the East Station]]\nAmenities on and around the High Street include food and drink stores, health and beauty outlets, trades and services, a variety of shops, an art gallery and a sports centre.\n\nThere are three churches:\n*[[Church of Scotland]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.notchurch.co.uk/ |title=Newport on Tay Church of Scotland :: Home |publisher=Notchurch.co.uk |date=2020-03-17 |accessdate=2020-03-28}}</ref>\n*[[Episcopal Church of Scotland]] (St Mary's)<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.standrews.anglican.org/index.php/churches_directory/church/newport_on_tay_st_marys/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=10 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927053800/http://www.standrews.anglican.org/index.php/churches_directory/church/newport_on_tay_st_marys/ |archive-date=27 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n*[[Roman Catholic]] (St. Fillans)<ref>{{cite web|author=Author |url=http://northfifecatholic.weebly.com/ |title=Home |publisher=Northfifecatholic.weebly.com |date=2019-12-15 |accessdate=2020-03-28}}</ref>\n\nA second Church of Scotland church, St. Fillans, originally a [[Free Church of Scotland (1843\u20131900)|Free Church]], was demolished in 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leisureandculturedundee.com/photopolis/st-fillans-free-church-newport-tay|title=St Fillans Free Church, Newport-On-Tay|first=Central Library|last=Community Information|website=www.leisureandculturedundee.com}}</ref>\n\n==Newport-on-Tay and the Arts==\nThe arts have played a major role in the shaping of Newport and its neighbourhood.

[[Thomas Telford]] built a new harbour in the 1820s, and the town expanded and grew into a [[Commuting|commuter]] suburb of Dundee as the prosperous [[jute]] manufacturers, [[industrialist]]s and the [[middle class|middle]] and [[skilled worker|upper working class]] of Dundee established fashionable residences in Newport.\n\nThe local war memorial dates from 1920 and was designed by Sir [[Robert Lorimer]].<ref>Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Robert Lorimer</ref>\n\nNewport-on-Tay formerly had two railway stations \u2013 the [[Newport-on-Tay East railway station|East]] and West stations on what was the [[Newport Railway, Scotland|Newport Railway]]. Both stations (and the Tayport-Dundee branch line) closed in 1969, having lost much of their business following the opening of the Tay Road Bridge in 1966.  In fact, trains had ceased to run beyond Newport-on-Tay East station to Tayport on 22 May 1966 so that the railway line could be breached to build the bridge's southern approach road. The Dundee \u2013 Newport ferry also closed promptly later in 1966 on the opening of the [[Tay Road Bridge]].

The Spanish broadcaster had used both national finals and internal selection to choose the Spanish entry in the past. For 2018 and 2019, TVE used the reality television singing competition ''[[Operaci\u00f3n Triunfo (Spanish TV series)|Operaci\u00f3n Triunfo]]'' (the Spanish version of ''[[Star Academy]]'') to select the artist and song to represent Spain in the contest, as they had previously done from 2002 to 2004. Despite the fact that TVE renewed ''Operaci\u00f3n Triunfo'' for [[Operaci\u00f3n Triunfo (series 11)|a further series]], TVE announced on 18 September 2019 that they would opt to select the Spanish entry for the 2020 contest through an internal selection.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pedra|first1=Jordi|url=https://wiwibloggs.com/2019/09/18/spain-rtve-confirms-internal-selection-for-eurovision-2020-and-says-well-known-artist-will-be-announced-soon/242310/|title=Spain: RTVE confirms internal selection for Eurovision 2020\u2026and says \u201cwell-known artist\u201d will be announced soon|date=18 September 2019|accessdate=23 January 2020|publisher=wiwibloggs.com}}</ref>\n\n==Before Eurovision==\n=== Internal selection ===\nOn 5 October 2019, TVE announced [[Blas Cant\u00f3]] as the Spanish entrant at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2020]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Granger|first1=Anthony|url=https://eurovoix.com/2019/10/05/spain-blas-canto-selected-for-eurovision-2020/|title=Spain: Blas Cant\u00f3 Selected For Eurovision 2020|date=5 October 2019|accessdate=23 January 2020|publisher=eurovoix.com}}</ref> His song \"[[Universo (song)|Universo]]\" was released on 30 January 2020 together with the official music video.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Granger|first1=Anthony|url=https://eurovoix.com/2020/01/22/spain-universo-reveal-on-january-30/|title=\"Universo\" Reveal on January 30|date=22 January 2020|accessdate=23 January 2020|publisher=eurovoix.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.rtve.es/television/20200130/videoclip-universo-blas-canto-eurovision-rotterdam-2020/1997720.shtml|title=Mira ya el videoclip de Blas Cant\u00f3, \"Universo\", la canci\u00f3n con la que representar\u00e1 a Espa\u00f1a en Eurovisi\u00f3n 2020|website=[[RTVE]]|date=2020-01-30|language=es-ES|access-date=2020-01-30}}</ref>\n\n== At Eurovision ==\nThe ''Eurovision Song Contest 2020'' will take place at [[Rotterdam Ahoy]] in [[Rotterdam]], [[Netherlands]] and consist of two semi-finals on 12 and 14 May and the final on 16 May 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eurovision.tv/story/rotterdam-to-host-eurovision-2020|title=Rotterdam to host Eurovision 2020!|website=eurovision.tv|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref> According to Eurovision rules, all nations with the exceptions of the host country and the \"[[Eurovision Song Contest#Big Four and Big Five|Big 5]]\" (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) are required to qualify from one of two semi-finals in order to compete for the final; the top ten countries from each semi-final progress to the final.
