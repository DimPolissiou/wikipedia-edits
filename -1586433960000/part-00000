The preprint may be available, often as a non-typeset version available free, before and/or after a paper is published in a journal.\n\n==Role==\nPublication of manuscripts in a peer-reviewed journal often takes weeks, months or even years from the time of initial submission, owing to the time required by editors and reviewers to evaluate and critique manuscripts, and the time required by authors to address critiques. The need to quickly circulate current results within a scholarly community has led researchers to distribute documents known as preprints, which are manuscripts that have yet to undergo [[peer review]]. They may be considered as [[grey literature]]. The immediate distribution of preprints allows authors to receive early feedback from their peers, which may be helpful in revising and preparing articles for submission.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.plos.org/absolutely-maybe/2016/05/01/breaking-down-pros-and-cons-of-preprints-in-biomedicine/|title=Breaking Down Pros and Cons of Preprints in Biomedicine |date=2016-05-01|work=Absolutely Maybe|access-date=2018-01-12|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nSince 1991, preprints have increasingly been distributed electronically on the [[Internet]], rather than as paper copies. This has given rise to massive preprint databases such as [[arXiv.org]] and to [[institutional repository|institutional repositories]]. The sharing of preprints goes back to at least the 1960s, when the [[National Institutes of Health]] circulated biological preprints. After six years the use of these Information Exchange Groups was stopped, partially because journals stopped accepting submissions shared via these channels.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cobb |first1=Matthew |title=The prehistory of biology preprints: A\u00a0forgotten experiment from the 1960s |journal=PLOS Biology |date=16 November 2017 |volume=15 |issue=11 |pages=e2003995 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.2003995|pmid=29145518 |pmc=5690419 }}</ref>\n\nToday, in some journals, posting preprints may disqualify the research from submission for publication due to the [[Ingelfinger rule|Ingelfinger Rule]].

Both the preprint and postprint may differ from the final published version of an article.

''In Review'' features a peer review timeline, which publicly displays information like when an editor is assigned and when peer reviews are received. Research Square also hosts the [https://protocolexchange.researchsquare.com/ Protocol Exchange] which is an open repository of community-contributed protocols sponsored by [[Nature Research]].\n\n[https://www.cambridge.org/engage/coe/public-dashboard Cambridge Open Engage] is the early content platform from [https://www.cambridge.org/ Cambridge University Press], designed to provide researchers with space and resources to connect and collaborate with their communities, and rapidly disseminate early research. It is free to upload and read content. Cambridge Open Engage content is primarily for the research community, across disciplines (though not accepting content with implications for clinical practice), but it is also freely accessible to all audiences. Content on Cambridge Open Engage is not peer-reviewed, but goes through a moderation process before it is posted. Cambridge University Press also partners with organizations such as learned societies, university departments or research centres. The first partner space was [https://preprints.apsanet.org/engage/apsa/public-dashboard APSA Preprints], launched on behalf of the American Political Science Association in August 2019.\n\n=== Library and information science ===\nThere are two servers for LIS and allied fields: [[E-LIS|Eprints in Library and Information Science (e-LIS)]] and the [https://osf.io/preprints/lissa LIS Scholarship Archive (LISSA)]. e-LIS was launched in 2003, and is an international [[open access]] [[Disciplinary repository|repository]] for academic papers in [[Library and Information Science]] (LIS), run by volunteers. LISSA was launched in 2017 as an open access repository for all materials created by those in LIS and allied fields, including work that happens outside the traditional realms of academia, such as oral histories, community works, code, data, and manuscripts. It is run by members of the library and archives community, and their technology partner, the Center for Open Science, using the [[Open Science Framework]] to host materials.\n\n=== Physical sciences ===\nThe e-print archive [[arXiv]] (pronounced \"archive\") is one of the best-known preprint servers.

Within the field of high-energy physics, the posting of preprints on arXiv is so common that many peer-reviewed journals allow [[Electronic submission|submission of papers]] from arXiv directly, using the arXiv e-print number.\n\nIn some branches of physics, the arXiv database may serve as a focal point for the many criticisms made of the peer review process and [[peer-reviewed journals]].  In his column in  ''[[Physics Today]]'', April 1992, [[David Mermin]] described Ginsparg's creation as potentially \"[[string theory]]'s greatest contribution to science\". About 8,000 preprints per month are uploaded to arXiv as of 2016.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21694990-old-fashioned-ways-reporting-new-discoveries-are-holding-back-medical-research|title=Taking the online medicine|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=2016-03-23}}</ref>\n\nAn engineering preprint server, [[engrXiv]], was launched in 2016 by the Center for Open Science and administrated by the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Stout]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blog.engrxiv.org/2016/07/announcement|title=engrXiv Blog {{!}} Announcing engrXiv, the eprint server for engineering|website=blog.engrxiv.org|access-date=2016-08-11}}</ref> Whilst under development, it used a temporary email deposit system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://osf.io/view/engrxiv/|title=OSF {{!}} Temporary Home of engrXiv Presentations|website=osf.io|access-date=2016-08-11}}</ref> As of April 2017, the official home for engrXiv went live after the web interface was launched in December 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blog.engrxiv.org/2016/12/engrxiv-is-here|title=engrXiv Blog|website=blog.engrxiv.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-13}}</ref>\n\nThe server [[viXra]] was established in 2009 for authors who are excluded from arXiv and other repositories owing to submission filtering.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Luis Reyes-Galindo|title=Automating the Horae: Boundary-work in the age of computers|journal=Social Studies of Science|date=2016|volume=46|issue=4|pages=586\u2013606|doi=10.1177/0306312716642317|pmid=28948871|arxiv=1603.03824|bibcode=2016arXiv160303824R}}</ref>\n\n=== Computer science ===\nThe ability to distribute manuscripts as preprints has had a great impact on computer science, particularly in the way that scientific research is disseminated in that field (see [[CiteSeer]]).

The preprint may be available, often as a non-typeset version available free, before and/or after a paper is published in a journal.\n\n==Role==\nPublication of manuscripts in a peer-reviewed journal often takes weeks, months or even years from the time of initial submission, owing to the time required by editors and reviewers to evaluate and critique manuscripts, and the time required by authors to address critiques. The need to quickly circulate current results within a scholarly community has led researchers to distribute documents known as preprints, which are manuscripts that have yet to undergo [[peer review]]. They may be considered as [[grey literature]]. The immediate distribution of preprints allows authors to receive early feedback from their peers, which may be helpful in revising and preparing articles for submission.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.plos.org/absolutely-maybe/2016/05/01/breaking-down-pros-and-cons-of-preprints-in-biomedicine/|title=Breaking Down Pros and Cons of Preprints in Biomedicine |date=2016-05-01|work=Absolutely Maybe|access-date=2018-01-12|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nSince 1991, preprints have increasingly been distributed electronically on the [[Internet]], rather than as paper copies. This has given rise to massive preprint databases such as [[arXiv.org]] and to [[institutional repository|institutional repositories]]. The sharing of preprints goes back to at least the 1960s, when the [[National Institutes of Health]] circulated biological preprints. After six years the use of these Information Exchange Groups was stopped, partially because journals stopped accepting submissions shared via these channels.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cobb |first1=Matthew |title=The prehistory of biology preprints: A\u00a0forgotten experiment from the 1960s |journal=PLOS Biology |date=16 November 2017 |volume=15 |issue=11 |pages=e2003995 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.2003995|pmid=29145518 |pmc=5690419 }}</ref>\n\nToday, in some journals, posting preprints may disqualify the research from submission for publication due to the [[Ingelfinger rule|Ingelfinger Rule]].

Articles are rendered in full HTML and commenting is allowed without registration. Research Square is also home to ''In Review'', an opt-in service that posts manuscripts as preprints to Research Square while they are under consideration at participating journals. ''In Review'' features a peer review timeline, which publicly displays information like when an editor is assigned and when peer reviews are received. Research Square also hosts the [https://protocolexchange.researchsquare.com/ Protocol Exchange] which is an open repository of community-contributed protocols sponsored by [[Nature Research]].\n\n=== Library and information science ===\nThere are two servers for LIS and allied fields: [[E-LIS|Eprints in Library and Information Science (e-LIS)]] and the [https://osf.io/preprints/lissa LIS Scholarship Archive (LISSA)]. e-LIS was launched in 2003, and is an international [[open access]] [[Disciplinary repository|repository]] for academic papers in [[Library and Information Science]] (LIS), run by volunteers. LISSA was launched in 2017 as an open access repository for all materials created by those in LIS and allied fields, including work that happens outside the traditional realms of academia, such as oral histories, community works, code, data, and manuscripts. It is run by members of the library and archives community, and their technology partner, the Center for Open Science, using the [[Open Science Framework]] to host materials.\n\n=== Physical sciences ===\nThe e-print archive [[arXiv]] (pronounced \"archive\") is one of the best-known preprint servers. It was created by [[Paul Ginsparg]] in 1991 at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] for the purpose of distributing theoretical [[high-energy physics]] preprints.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nature.com/news/the-arxiv-preprint-server-hits-1-million-articles-1.16643|title=The arXiv preprint server hits 1 million articles|date=December 30, 2014|newspaper=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|quote=|access-date=2015-09-07|author=Richard Van Noorden}}</ref> In 2001, arXiv.org moved to [[Cornell University]] and now encompasses the fields of physics, mathematics, [[computer science]], [[quantitative biology]], [[quantitative finance]], [[statistics]]. Within the field of high-energy physics, the posting of preprints on arXiv is so common that many peer-reviewed journals allow [[Electronic submission|submission of papers]] from arXiv directly, using the arXiv e-print number.\n\nIn some branches of physics, the arXiv database may serve as a focal point for the many criticisms made of the peer review process and [[peer-reviewed journals]].  In his column in  ''[[Physics Today]]'', April 1992, [[David Mermin]] described Ginsparg's creation as potentially \"[[string theory]]'s greatest contribution to science\". About 8,000 preprints per month are uploaded to arXiv as of 2016.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21694990-old-fashioned-ways-reporting-new-discoveries-are-holding-back-medical-research|title=Taking the online medicine|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=2016-03-23}}</ref>\n\nAn engineering preprint server, [[engrXiv]], was launched in 2016 by the Center for Open Science and administrated by the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Stout]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blog.engrxiv.org/2016/07/announcement|title=engrXiv Blog {{!}} Announcing engrXiv, the eprint server for engineering|website=blog.engrxiv.org|access-date=2016-08-11}}</ref> Whilst under development, it used a temporary email deposit system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://osf.io/view/engrxiv/|title=OSF {{!}} Temporary Home of engrXiv Presentations|website=osf.io|access-date=2016-08-11}}</ref> As of April 2017, the official home for engrXiv went live after the web interface was launched in December 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blog.engrxiv.org/2016/12/engrxiv-is-here|title=engrXiv Blog|website=blog.engrxiv.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-13}}</ref>\n\nThe server [[viXra]] was established in 2009 for authors who are excluded from arXiv and other repositories owing to submission filtering.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Luis Reyes-Galindo|title=Automating the Horae: Boundary-work in the age of computers|journal=Social Studies of Science|date=2016|volume=46|issue=4|pages=586\u2013606|doi=10.1177/0306312716642317|pmid=28948871|arxiv=1603.03824|bibcode=2016arXiv160303824R}}</ref>\n\n=== Computer science ===\nThe ability to distribute manuscripts as preprints has had a great impact on computer science, particularly in the way that scientific research is disseminated in that field (see [[CiteSeer]]). The [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] movement has tended to focus on distributed institutional collections of research, global harvesting, and aggregation through [[Search engine (computing)|search engine]]s and [[Gateway (web page)|gateway]]s such as [[OAIster]], rather than a global discipline base such as arXiv. ''E-prints'' can now refer to any electronic form of a scholarly or scientific publication, including journal articles, conference papers, research theses or dissertations, because these usually are found in multidisciplinary collections, called open access repositories, or eprints archives.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Graziotin|first=Daniel|last2=Wang|first2=Xiaofeng|last3=Abrahamsson|first3=Pekka|date=2014|title=A framework for systematic analysis of open access journals and its application in software engineering and information systems|journal=Scientometrics|volume=101|issue=3|pages=1627\u20131656|doi=10.1007/s11192-014-1278-7|arxiv=1308.2597}}</ref>\n\n=== Biological and chemical sciences ===\nThe biological sciences have lagged behind the physical sciences in their use of preprints.

His notable films include ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961), ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), ''[[Jacqueline Susann's Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975), ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' (1979), ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'' (1981), ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1991), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), ''[[Hollywood Ending]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Congressman]]'' (2016). For his debut performance in ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), Hamilton won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]]. He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two additional Golden Globe nominations.\n\nHamilton began his film career in 1958 and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television he is, perhaps, most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual suntan. [[Bo Derek]] writes in her autobiography that \"there was an ongoing contest between [[John Derek|John]] [Derek] and George Hamilton as to who was tanner\".<ref>Derek, Bo (with Mark Seal) (2002), ''Riding Lessons: Everything That Matters in Life I Learned from Horses'', ReganBooks HarperCollins, {{ISBN|0060394374}}, p.212</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHamilton was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], the middle of three boys with an older maternal half brother and a younger full brother, and lived in [[Blytheville, Arkansas]]. He is the eldest son of bandleader [[George Hamilton (musician)|George \"Spike\" Hamilton]].<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/43/George-Hamilton.html George Hamilton Biography (1939\u2013)<!-- Bot generated title -->] from filmreference.com</ref>\n\nHis stepfathers were Carleton Hunt and Jesse Spalding; his stepmother was June Howard, with whom Hamilton said he had an affair when he was 12 years old which was shortly after she married his father.<ref>Beifuss, John.

He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (miniseries)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was \"a hot commodity these days\" because he was dating [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s daughter.<ref>Lynda Johnson Gets A Job at McCall's: LYNDA BIRD GETS A JOB AT M'CALL'S By TERENCE SMITH.

He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed. [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], Uni of California 2006 p 289</ref>\n\nHe appeared in a TV movie, ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'' (1973), and had a support role as a wealthy rancher whose wife was trying to leave him in the western, ''[[The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (film)|The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing]]'', starring [[Burt Reynolds]] (1973).\n\nHe produced and appeared in ''[[Medusa (1973 film)|Medusa]]'' (1973). He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Jacqueline Susann's Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice (TV series)|Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (film)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the miniseries ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice (film)|Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1992), ''[[Once Upon a Crime...]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (1993 film)|Amore!]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished (1995 film)|Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''Playback'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''[[Bonnie (TV series)|Bonnie]]'', ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]'', ''[[Hart to Hart]]'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. He auditioned for the show and in March 2007, [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker. According to [[Reuters]], Hamilton was one of the final three contenders to host the show, alongside [[Mark Steines]] and [[Todd Newton]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN1624240720070416 Trio remaining in Price line] from Reuters</ref> Soon thereafter, however, [[Drew Carey]] was named as Barker's successor.

For his debut performance in ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), Hamilton won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]]. He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two additional Golden Globe nominations.\n\nHamilton began his film career in 1958 and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television he is, perhaps, most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual suntan.

He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (miniseries)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was \"a hot commodity these days\" because he was dating [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s daughter.<ref>Lynda Johnson Gets A Job at McCall's: LYNDA BIRD GETS A JOB AT M'CALL'S By TERENCE SMITH.

He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed. [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], Uni of California 2006 p 289</ref>\n\nHe appeared in a TV movie, ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'' (1973), and had a support role as a wealthy rancher whose wife was trying to leave him in the western, ''[[The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (film)|The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing]]'', starring [[Burt Reynolds]] (1973).\n\nHe produced and appeared in ''[[Medusa (1973 film)|Medusa]]'' (1973). He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Jacqueline Susann's Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice (TV series)|Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (film)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the miniseries ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice (film)|Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1992), ''[[Once Upon a Crime...]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (1993 film)|Amore!]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''[[Playback (film)|Playback]]'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''[[Bonnie (TV series)|Bonnie]]'', ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]'', ''[[Hart to Hart]]'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. He auditioned for the show and in March 2007, [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker. According to [[Reuters]], Hamilton was one of the final three contenders to host the show, alongside [[Mark Steines]] and [[Todd Newton]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN1624240720070416 Trio remaining in Price line] from Reuters</ref> Soon thereafter, however, [[Drew Carey]] was named as Barker's successor.

By contrast, nearby places such as [[Arikamedu]], [[Ariyankuppam]], Kakayanthoppe, [[Villianur]] and Bahour, which were colonised by the [[French East India Company]] over a period of time and later became the [[union territory]] of Pondicherry, have recorded histories that predate the colonial period.\n\n''Poduke'' or ''Poduca''  (a marketplace) was a Roman trading destination from the mid 1st century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gopondy.wordpress.com/get-introduced/puducherry-overview/|title=Puducherry Overview|last=Gopondy|access-date=19 July 2019}}</ref> ''Poduca'' has been identified as possibly being [[Arikamedu]] (now part of Ariyankuppam), located about 2 miles (3.2 km) from the modern city of Pondicherry. The area was part of the [[Pallava dynasty|Pallava]] Kingdom of [[Kanchipuram]] in the 4th century. The [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]] of [[Thanjavur]] held it from the 10th to 13th centuries until it was replaced by the [[Pandyan Dynasty|Pandya]] Kingdom in the 13th century. The [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar]] Empire took control of almost all of the south of India in the 14th century and maintained control until 1638 when they were supplanted by the [[Adil Shahi dynasty|Sultan of Bijapur]].\n\nIn 1674 the [[French East India Company]] set up a trading centre at Pondicherry and this outpost eventually became the chief French settlement in India. Five trading posts were established along the south Indian coast between 1668 and 1674. The city was separated by a canal into the French Quarter and the Indian Quarter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/travel/destinations/asia/78427269/peace-love-and-a-french-flavour-in-pondicherry-south-india|title=Peace, love and a French flavour in Pondicherry, South India|last=WORRALL|first=JILL|date=11 April 2016|website=www.stuff.co.nz|publisher=|access-date=2 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nDuring the Anglo-French wars (1742\u20131763), Puducherry changed hands frequently. On 16 January 1761, the British captured Pondicherry from the French, but it was returned under the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]] at the conclusion of the [[Seven Years' War]].<ref>Chand, Hukam. ''History Of Medieval India'', 202.</ref> In 1792, Venant of Durfort, son of the Count of Civrac, was made governor of Pondicherry, thanks to his uncle Emmanuel-F\u00e9licit\u00e9, Duke of Duras, who had been made president of the ''compagnie des Indes'' in 1788. After an outstanding military career in Europe, Venant fought hard to destroy all revolutionary hopes in Pondicherry, as republican ideals coming from France were threatening the economic stability of the region. He took great care to maintain commercial relations with other European powers in the region. His links with England were strengthened through his marriage with Catherine Browne of Kilmor. Venant died in July 1792 and was buried at Our Lady of Angels in Pondicherry.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Durand |first1=Yves |title=La Maison de Durfort \u00e0 l'Epoque Moderne |date=1975 |page=261}}</ref> The British took control of the area again in 1793 at the [[Siege of Pondicherry (1793)|Siege of Pondicherry]] amid the Wars of the [[French Revolution]], and returned it to France in 1814. When the British gained control of India in the late 1850s, they allowed the French to retain their settlements in the country. [[Pondicherry district|Pondicherry]], [[Mah\u00e9, India|Mah\u00e9]], [[Yanam]], [[Karaikal]] and [[Chandernagor]] remained a part of [[French India]] until 1954 when it was incorporated into the Indian Union with the rest of French India.\n\nThe  18th  March 1954,  a  num\u00adber  of  resolutions  were  passed  by  the municipalities    in    Pondicherry    de\u00admanding  immediate  merger  with    In\u00addia.

They  are  not  asking for  the    immediate  transfer  of    the de  jure  sovereignty  of  France.   Their suggestion  is  that  a de  facto  transfer of  the  administration  should  take  place immediately,  while  French  sovereignty should  continue    until  the    constitu\u00adtional  issue    has  been  settled.

The ''[[de facto]]'' transfer of the French Indian territories from French governance to the Indian union took place on 1 November 1954, and was established as the union territory of [[Puducherry|Pondicherry]]. However, the formal ''[[de jure]]'' transfer of territory agreement between France and India was signed on 16 August 1962.\n\n==Topography==\nThe [[topography]] of Pondicherry is the same as that of coastal [[Tamil Nadu]]. Pondicherry's average elevation is at [[sea level]], and a number of sea inlets, referred to as \"[[Kerala backwaters|backwaters]]\" can be found. Pondicherry experiences extreme [[coastal erosion]] as a result of a breakwater constructed in 1989,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://memestreamblog.wordpress.com/2008/10/16/the-story-of-pondicherrys-eroding-coastline-in-a-single-image/|title=The Story of Pondicherry's Eroding Coastline in a Single Image|date=16 October 2008}}</ref> just to the south of the city. Where there was once a broad, sandy beach, now the city is protected against the sea by a 2-km-long [[seawall]] which sits at a height of 8.5 m above [[sea level]]. Whilst there was an early seawall made by the French government in 1735, this was not \"hard structure coastal defense\" so much as an adjunct to the old shipping pier and a transition from the beach to the city,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pondicherryonline.in/Profile/Geography/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916004530/http://pondicherryonline.in/Profile/Geography/ |archivedate=16 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nToday, the seawall consists of rows of granite boulders which are reinforced every year in an attempt to stop [[erosion]]. As a consequence of the seawall, there is severe seabed erosion and turbulence at the coastal margin, resulting in an extreme loss of biodiversity within the critical [[intertidal zone]]. Whenever gaps appear as the stones fall into the continually eroding seabed, the government adds more boulders. Pondicherry's seawall has also caused beach erosion to migrate further up the coast, to the fishing villages in Puducherry and Tamil Nadu to the north of the city.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n==Economy==\n{{Expand section|date=February 2011}}\n[[File:Mahatma Gandhi Medical College & Research Institute.JPG|thumb|The Mahatma Gandhi Medical College]]\n\n[[File:Sri_Manakula_Vinayagar_Engineering_College.jpg|thumb|The Sri Manakula Vinayagar Engineering College]]\nIn 2012, the [[Ministry of Power (India)|Ministry of Power]] inaugurated the ''Smart Grid'' project in Puducherry.<ref name=\"smartgrid\">{{cite news|title=Smart grid project inaugurated|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/smart-grid-project-inaugurated/article4015596.ece|date=20 October 2012|agency=[[The Hindu]]|location=Puducherry|accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref> Farming around Pondicherry include crops such as rice, pulses, sugarcane, coconuts, and cotton.\nIn 2016, the Pondicherry State Government Employees Central Federation presented a status paper on the fiscal and social crisis in Puducherry to Union Home Minister [[Rajnath Singh]].

By contrast, nearby places such as [[Arikamedu]], [[Ariyankuppam]], Kakayanthoppe, [[Villianur]] and Bahour, which were colonised by the [[French East India Company]] over a period of time and later became the [[union territory]] of Pondicherry, have recorded histories that predate the colonial period.\n\n''Poduke'' or ''Poduca''  (a marketplace) was a Roman trading destination from the mid 1st century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gopondy.wordpress.com/get-introduced/puducherry-overview/|title=Puducherry Overview|last=Gopondy|access-date=19 July 2019}}</ref> ''Poduca'' has been identified as possibly being [[Arikamedu]] (now part of Ariyankuppam), located about 2 miles (3.2 km) from the modern city of Pondicherry. The area was part of the [[Pallava dynasty|Pallava]] Kingdom of [[Kanchipuram]] in the 4th century. The [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]] of [[Thanjavur]] held it from the 10th to 13th centuries until it was replaced by the [[Pandyan Dynasty|Pandya]] Kingdom in the 13th century. The [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar]] Empire took control of almost all of the south of India in the 14th century and maintained control until 1638 when they were supplanted by the [[Adil Shahi dynasty|Sultan of Bijapur]].\n\nIn 1674 the [[French East India Company]] set up a trading centre at Pondicherry and this outpost eventually became the chief French settlement in India. Five trading posts were established along the south Indian coast between 1668 and 1674. The city was separated by a canal into the French Quarter and the Indian Quarter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/travel/destinations/asia/78427269/peace-love-and-a-french-flavour-in-pondicherry-south-india|title=Peace, love and a French flavour in Pondicherry, South India|last=WORRALL|first=JILL|date=11 April 2016|website=www.stuff.co.nz|publisher=|access-date=2 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nDuring the Anglo-French wars (1742\u20131763), Puducherry changed hands frequently. On 16 January 1761, the British captured Pondicherry from the French, but it was returned under the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]] at the conclusion of the [[Seven Years' War]].<ref>Chand, Hukam. ''History Of Medieval India'', 202.</ref> In 1792, Venant of Durfort, son of the Count of Civrac, was made governor of Pondicherry, thanks to his uncle Emmanuel-F\u00e9licit\u00e9, Duke of Duras, who had been made president of the ''compagnie des Indes'' in 1788. After an outstanding military career in Europe, Venant fought hard to destroy all revolutionary hopes in Pondicherry, as republican ideals coming from France were threatening the economic stability of the region. He took great care to maintain commercial relations with other European powers in the region. His links with England were strengthened through his marriage with Catherine Browne of Kilmor. Venant died in July 1792 and was buried at Our Lady of Angels in Pondicherry.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Durand |first1=Yves |title=La Maison de Durfort \u00e0 l'Epoque Moderne |date=1975 |page=261}}</ref> The British took control of the area again in 1793 at the [[Siege of Pondicherry (1793)|Siege of Pondicherry]] amid the Wars of the [[French Revolution]], and returned it to France in 1814. When the British gained control of India in the late 1850s, they allowed the French to retain their settlements in the country. [[Pondicherry district|Pondicherry]], [[Mah\u00e9, India|Mah\u00e9]], [[Yanam]], [[Karaikal]] and [[Chandernagor]] remained a part of [[French India]] until 1954 when it was incorporated into the Indian Union with the rest of French India.\n\nThe  18th  March 1954,  a  num\u00adber  of  resolutions  were  passed  by  the municipalities    in    Pondicherry    de\u00admanding  immediate  merger  with    In\u00addia.

They  are  not  asking for  the    immediate  transfer  of    the de  jure  sovereignty  of  France.   Their suggestion  is  that  a de  facto  transfer of  the  administration  should  take  place immediately,  while  French  sovereignty should  continue    until  the    constitu\u00adtional  issue    has  been  settled.

The ''[[de facto]]'' transfer of the French Indian territories from French governance to the Indian union took place on 1 November 1954, and was established as the union territory of [[Puducherry|Pondicherry]]. However, the formal ''[[de jure]]'' transfer of territory agreement between France and India was signed on 16 August 1962.\n\n==Topography==\nThe [[topography]] of Pondicherry is the same as that of coastal [[Tamil Nadu]]. Pondicherry's average elevation is at [[sea level]], and a number of sea inlets, referred to as \"[[Kerala backwaters|backwaters]]\" can be found. Pondicherry experiences extreme [[coastal erosion]] as a result of a breakwater constructed in 1989,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://memestreamblog.wordpress.com/2008/10/16/the-story-of-pondicherrys-eroding-coastline-in-a-single-image/|title=The Story of Pondicherry's Eroding Coastline in a Single Image|date=16 October 2008}}</ref> just to the south of the city. Where there was once a broad, sandy beach, now the city is protected against the sea by a 2-km-long [[seawall]] which sits at a height of 8.5 m above [[sea level]]. Whilst there was an early seawall made by the French government in 1735, this was not \"hard structure coastal defense\" so much as an adjunct to the old shipping pier and a transition from the beach to the city,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pondicherryonline.in/Profile/Geography/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916004530/http://pondicherryonline.in/Profile/Geography/ |archivedate=16 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nToday, the seawall consists of rows of granite boulders which are reinforced every year in an attempt to stop [[erosion]]. As a consequence of the seawall, there is severe seabed erosion and turbulence at the coastal margin, resulting in an extreme loss of biodiversity within the critical [[intertidal zone]]. Whenever gaps appear as the stones fall into the continually eroding seabed, the government adds more boulders. Pondicherry's seawall has also caused beach erosion to migrate further up the coast, to the fishing villages in Puducherry and Tamil Nadu to the north of the city.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n==Economy==\n{{Expand section|date=February 2011}}\n[[File:Mahatma Gandhi Medical College & Research Institute.JPG|thumb|The Mahatma Gandhi Medical College]]\n\n[[File:Sri_Manakula_Vinayagar_Engineering_College.jpg|thumb|The Sri Manakula Vinayagar Engineering College]]\nIn 2012, the [[Ministry of Power (India)|Ministry of Power]] inaugurated the ''Smart Grid'' project in Puducherry.<ref name=\"smartgrid\">{{cite news|title=Smart grid project inaugurated|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/smart-grid-project-inaugurated/article4015596.ece|date=20 October 2012|agency=[[The Hindu]]|location=Puducherry|accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref> Farming around Pondicherry include crops such as rice, pulses, sugarcane, coconuts, and cotton.\nIn 2016, the Pondicherry State Government Employees Central Federation presented a status paper on the fiscal and social crisis in Puducherry to Union Home Minister [[Rajnath Singh]].

The city has many colonial buildings, churches, temples and statues which, combined with the town planning and French style avenues in the old part of town, still preserve much of the colonial ambiance.\n\nWhile the sea is a draw for tourists, Pondicherry no longer has the sandy beaches that once graced its coastline.{{fact|date=April 2019}} The breakwater to the harbour and other hard structures constructed on the shore caused extreme [[coastal erosion]] and the sand from Pondicherry's [[Promenade Beach]] was permitted to disappear entirely. As a result of the city's seawall and [[groyne]] construction, the beaches further up the coast to the north have also been lost.  An enormous deposition of sand has accrued to the south of the harbour breakwater, but this is not a commodious beach and is not easily accessible from the city.\n\nBut recently, the government has been taking steps by constructing a reef and re-dosing sand. The sea is accessible by a small patch of land at the Promenade Beach (Goubert Avenue).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/300818/artificial-reef-helps-restore-lost-pondy-beach.html|title=Artificial reef helps restore lost Pondy beach|last=M|first=Kavya|date=2018-08-30|website=Deccan Chronicle|language=en|access-date=2020-01-28}}</ref> Moreover, the beach is one of the cleanest in India and has been selected for [[Blue Flag beach|Blue Flag]] certification.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/puducherry/beach-in-puducherry-selected-for-blue-flag-certification/articleshow/69668759.cms|title=Beach in Puducherry selected for blue flag certification {{!}} Puducherry News - Times of India|last=Jun 6|first=Bosco Dominique {{!}} TNN {{!}}|last2=2019|website=The Times of India|language=en|access-date=2020-01-28|last3=Ist|first3=12:31}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Aurobindo Ashram Pondichery - Outside view.jpg|thumb|left|Visitors at the Sri Aurobindo Ashram]]\nThe Sri Aurobindo Ashram, located on rue de la Marine, is one of the most important [[ashram]]s in India, founded by the renowned [[Indian independence movement|Freedom Fighter]] and spiritual philosopher [[Sri Aurobindo]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sriaurobindoashram.org/sriaurobindo/|title=Sri Aurobindo|access-date=19 July 2019}}</ref> [[Auroville]] (City of Dawn) is an \"experimental\" township located 8&nbsp;km north-west of Pondicherry.\n\nThere are a number of old and large churches in Pondicherry, most of which were built in the 18th and 19th centuries.

Several kinds of cheeses are popular, including ''{{Transl|arz|gebna b\u0113\u1e0da}}'' or [[Domyati]] cheese, ''{{transl|arz|gebna r\u016bmi}}'' (Roman cheese) which is similar to ''[[Pecorino Romano]]'' or ''[[Manchego]]'', and Istanbuli cheese (a brined white cheese with peppers added to the brine which makes it spicy).

(464786586).jpg|thumb|right|Chinese homemade congee]]\nAs [[mainland China]] is made up of many distinct provinces, each with their own unique cuisine, breakfast in China can vary significantly from province to province. In general, basic choices include sweet or salty pancakes, soup, deep-fried bread sticks or doughnuts ([[youtiao]]), buns ([[mantou]]), porridge ([[congee]]), and fried or soup-based noodles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chinese Cuisine|url=http://www.saturdaymarket.com/chinabreakfast/intro.htm|accessdate=28 June 2012}}</ref> These options are often accompanied by tea or sweetened soybean milk. However, condiments for porridge and the soup base tend to vary between provinces and regions. The types of teas that are served and spices that are used can also differ significantly between the provinces.\n\n====Hong Kong====\nDue to its near two centuries' history as a British colony and proximity to China's Canton region, both English and traditional Cantonese style breakfasts are of somewhat equal popularity in [[Hong Kong]], as well as the hybrid form of breakfast commonly offered in [[Cha chaan teng]].

''[[Tieguanyin]]'' is the most common accompaniment, but other teas such as ''[[pu'er tea|pu'er]]'' and ''[[oolong]]'' are also common.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Taste of Chinese Breakfast|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/Life/35510.htm|accessdate=28 June 2012}}</ref> Fried and rice-based noodles and cakes are also popular. In modern times, dim sum is commonly prepared and served in [[Yum cha|Yum Cha]] restaurants rather than at home because of the skill and efforts involved in the preparation.\n\n===Bangladesh===\nThe typical Bangladeshi breakfast consists of flour-based flat breads such as [[chapati]], [[roti]] or [[paratha]], served with a curry.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Usually the curry can be vegetable, home-fried potatoes or scrambled eggs. The breakfast varies according to location and the eater's income. In villages and rural areas, rice with curry (potato mash, dal ) is mostly preferred by day labourers. In the city, sliced bread with jam or jelly is chosen due to time efficiency. In Bangladesh tea is preferred to coffee, and is an essential part of most breakfasts.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Having toasted biscuits, bread or puffed rice with tea is also very popular.\n\n===India===\nIn all, there are at least 25 types of Indian breakfasts, each consisting of a choice of over 100 different food items.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jaffrey|first1=Madhur|title=Vegetarian India|year= 2015|publisher=Penguin Random House|location=New Delhi|url=http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/247938/vegetarian-india-by-madhur-jaffrey/9781101874868|accessdate=28 April 2017}}</ref> Each state in India has different specialties and items for breakfast.

Other popular south Indian breakfast items are [[Pongal (dish)|pongal]], [[bisibelebath]] (sambar rice), [[upma]], and [[poori]].

The term originated in Britain in the mid-19th century, first used in 1896 public hygiene book ''The Sanitarian'', in which \"continent\" refers to the countries of mainland [[Europe]], though the idea had been around for a few decades as American hotels endeavored to appeal to the changing tastes of the emerging middle class and European travelers visiting America. The term refers to the type of breakfast found in places such as France and the Mediterranean, which is lighter and more delicate than the typical full English breakfast, which tends to consist of a large plate of eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, beans, and roasted mushrooms and tomatoes, and American breakfasts featuring eggs, breakfast meats, pancakes, potatoes, and toast.

Usually the [[Maltese people|Maltese]] start their day with a bowl of cereal mixed with milk, sometimes with a cup of coffee or tea. Marmalade/jams or even chocolate spreads are also common on bread or toast. Today cereal bars are also becoming a common type of breakfast on the island. The traditional English breakfast of eggs, sausages, and fried bacon was also popular among the Maltese, especially on Sundays, due to the strong British influence on the island, but this has diminished almost completely, as locals have rediscovered a more Mediterranean and continental diet over the recent years. Hotels usually serve both a continental as well as a full English breakfast. Prayers are often said before breakfast in order to bless the meal.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Guide To Maltese Cooking|last=Darmanin|first=Francis|isbn=99909-79-00-6|publisher=Jumbo Productions|location=Malta|page=14|date=September 1997}}</ref>\n\n===Netherlands and Belgium===\nFor breakfast, the Dutch and Belgians typically eat sliced bread with butter or margarine and various choices of toppings: [[dairy product]]s (numerous variations of cheese), a variety of cured and sliced meats, or sweet or semi-sweet products such as jam, [[syrup]] (from sugar beets or fruit), [[honey]], Kokosbrood (a coconut product that is served thinly sliced like sliced cheese) or [[peanut butter]]. Another type of sweet toppings are the chocolate toppings; the Dutch have chocolate toppings in all variations: ''[[hagelslag]]'' (chocolate sprinkles), ''[[Vlokken|chocoladevlokken]]'' (chocolate flakes) (both typically Dutch), and ''chocoladepasta ''([[chocolate spread]]).<ref name=\"wintle\">{{cite book|last=Wintle|first=Michael|editor=Thomas M.

A perfect \"weekend breakfast\" for the Dutch contained coffee or tea, fresh-baked bread rolls (and croissants), and a boiled egg.

More ample breakfasts may include fish, a diverse array of cheese, eggs, bacon, breads, and hot and cold cereals eaten in various combinations.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Pastries such as [[croissants]] or ''[[pain au chocolat]]'' have become increasingly common since the 1990s.\n\n===Poland===\nThe traditional Polish breakfast is a large spread with a variety of sides eaten with bread or toast. Sides include various cold cuts, meat spreads, the Polish sausage [[kielbasa]], tomatoes, cheese, and sliced pickles. ''[[Quark (cheese)|Twar\u00f3g]],'' a Polish cheese, is the breakfast classic and comes in many forms. ''Twar\u00f3g'' can be eaten plain, with salt, sugar, or honey, or it can be mixed with [[chives]] into a [[cream cheese]]-like spread. Eggs are served often as the main breakfast item, mostly soft-boiled or scrambled. For a quick winter breakfast, hot oatmeal, to which cocoa is sometimes added, is often served. Jam spreads are popular for a quick breakfast, including plum, raspberry, and black or red [[Ribes|currant]] spreads. Breakfast drinks include coffee, milk, hot cocoa, or tea. Traditionally, the Poles avoid heavy-cooked foods for breakfast.<ref>Polish Cooking Marianna Olszewska Heberle Penguin 2005 {{ISBN|9781440624759}}</ref> For the most part, one will not see fried meats or potatoes in a classic Polish breakfast. Emphasis is placed on a large variety of foods to satisfy everyone at the breakfast table.\n\n===Romania===\nThe traditional Romanian breakfast is milk, tea or coffee alongside (toasted) bread with butter or margarine and on top of it, honey or fruit jams or preserves. Sometimes the buttered bread is served savory instead of sweet, in which case the Romanians add cured meats, salami, or cheese. Another option is to spread on a slice of bread some liver p\u00e2t\u00e9.

In [[Madrid]], ''churros'' are somewhat smaller and shaped like a [[charity ribbon]].{{clarify|date=October 2015}} This meal is normally served in cafeter\u00edas but it is not a regular or usual breakfast at Madrid homes. The usual one is the same as in the rest of Spain: coffee with milk or [[Cola Cao]], orange juice, biscuits or toasts, with butter and jam.\n\nIn the North, East and West it is more common to have a cup of coffee (usually with milk) or [[Cola Cao]] and a toast with a choice of [[olive oil]] and salt, [[tomato]] and olive oil, [[butter]], jam, p\u00e2t\u00e9, ''[[jam\u00f3n serrano]]'' (cured ham), and other options like ''[[Sobrassada|sobrasada]]'' (a raw cured spiced sausage that is easy to spread),<ref>Unesco, [http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/00394 The Mediterranean diet]</ref> and in [[Andalucia]], ''[[pring\u00e1]]''. Freshly squeezed orange juice is widely available in most places as an alternative for coffee. The breakfast is not often larger than these two items, because usually in late morning there is a break known as ''[[almuerzo]]'' when there is a snack. Sometimes, toast is replaced with ''galletas'' (a type of cookie made with flour, sugar, oil, and vanilla flavour), ''magdalenas'' (a Spanish version of the French [[Madeleine (cake)|madeleine]] made with oil instead of butter) or buns.\n\n===Sweden===\nBreakfast in [[Sweden]] is usually an [[open sandwich]] of soft bread or [[crisp bread]], cold cuts, [[sm\u00f6rg\u00e5skaviar]], cheese, cottage cheese, cream cheese, eggs, scrambled or boiled, p\u00e2t\u00e9 ([[leverpastej]]) with [[pickled cucumber]], tomatoes or cucumber, or a toast with marmalade or maybe honey, juices, coffee, [[hot chocolate]]. or tea.

Tea and coffee remain equally popular accompaniments. Marmalade, originally a Portuguese confection, had been a popular British spread to consume in the evening, before the Scots moved it to the breakfast table in the 18th century.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/08/19/1061261128384.html|title=Spread over centuries|date=10 June 2015|agency=The Age|issue=19 August 2003}}</ref> It is however becoming very common to 'skip breakfast' entirely or take coffee or pastries on the morning commute. Portable quick snacks such as [[granola bars]], ready-cut fruit and warm takeaway foods are becoming increasingly commonly consumed away from home and are sold at commuting points and [[newsagents]] and local shops in all urban areas.\n\nThe traditional breakfast most associated with Britain and Ireland remains, however, the [[full breakfast]] of eggs (fried, scrambled, or [[poaching (cooking)|poached]]) with [[bacon]] and [[sausages]], usually with mushrooms, tomatoes, [[baked beans]], fried bread, [[black pudding]] or [[white pudding]], and toast. Dating from a time when hard labour was more common, calorie intakes were necessarily higher, and servant labour was more available, it is nowadays regarded as a meal for the weekend or holidays when time is available for preparation, prepared by parents to welcome children, or as a special occasion such as a birthday or anniversary, or following a night of drinking. A healthy and nutritious version consists of grilling the protein and using poached, rather than fried, eggs, and variations based on one egg, one protein, and toast abound. It remains by far the most common choice on [[brunch]] menus and breakfast cafes across the region. The \"full Scottish breakfast\" tends to omit pork sausages and have beef sausages or lamb [[haggis]] instead. At its most extensive it consists of eggs, [[Lorne sausage|square sausage]], fried dumpling, [[potato scone]], tomato, mushrooms, bacon beef links, and [[fried bread]]. Originating in the British isles during the [[Victorian era]], the full breakfast is among the most internationally recognised [[British cuisine|British dishes]].<ref>{{cite book|title=British Food: An Extraordinary Thousand Years of History|last=Spencer|first=Colin|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-231-13110-0}}</ref>\n\nAnother traditional British breakfast consists of [[porridge]], although now associated with Scotland, it has been consumed across Britain as a staple food since at least the [[Middle Ages]].

With this comes fresh cream, fresh cheese, and fried plantains (or [[cooking plantain]]). It is common to add hot sauce made out of \"[[chiltepe]]s\" (a type of pepper). They are prepared raw or boiled, then they are ground with some vinegar, chopped onions, and chopped cilantro to make the hot sauce. A traditional egg dish prepared with both green and red sauces is called \"huevos divorciados.\"\nIn the eastern part of the country, specifically in [[Zacapa]], you can find \"huevos a caballo\" or (eggs on a horse) which is basically two fried eggs over roasted steak.\n\nOther types of breakfast include milk cereals. The most common drinks are orange juice or other fruits, milk, atol (a milk pudding with chocolate), and corn starch. The coffee is normally served with sweet bread also called \"pan de manteca\" (or butter bread).\n\n===Honduras===\nIn [[Honduras]] it is typical to start the day with homemade bread, with coffee or a glass of milk.

Flat bread with olive oil and ''[[Za'atar|za'tar]]'' is also popular.<ref name=\"fescooking.com\" />\n\n===China===\n[[File:Mama's congee. (464786586).jpg|thumb|right|Chinese homemade congee]]\nAs [[mainland China]] is made up of many distinct provinces, each with their own unique cuisine, breakfast in China can vary significantly from province to province. In general, basic choices include sweet or salty pancakes, soup, deep-fried bread sticks or doughnuts ([[youtiao]]), buns ([[mantou]]), porridge ([[congee]]), and fried or soup-based noodles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chinese Cuisine|url=http://www.saturdaymarket.com/chinabreakfast/intro.htm|accessdate=28 June 2012}}</ref> These options are often accompanied by tea or sweetened soybean milk. However, condiments for porridge and the soup base tend to vary between provinces and regions. The types of teas that are served and spices that are used can also differ significantly between the provinces.\n\n====Hong Kong====\nDue to its near two centuries' history as a British colony and proximity to China's Canton region, both English and traditional Cantonese style breakfasts are of somewhat equal popularity in [[Hong Kong]], as well as the hybrid form of breakfast commonly offered in [[Cha chaan teng]]. Cha Chaan Teng breakfasts often include [[Hong Kong-style milk tea]], pan fried egg, bread, Cantonese noodles or Hong Kong style macaroni in soup.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://travel.cnn.com/hong-kong/eat/cha-chaan-teng-cheat-sheet-how-order-hong-kongs-temples-comfort-food-726567|title=Cha chaan teng cheat sheet: What to order at the most popular eateries in Hong Kong|work=travel.cnn.com|accessdate=30 December 2013}}</ref> Traditional Cantonese breakfast may include [[dim sum]], which include a variety of different ingredients and are prepared in numerous different forms from delicately wrapped baby shrimp steamed dumplings to sweet water chestnut cake. Each dish is designed to be sampled and diners can go through a large selection of dim sum quickly accompanied by a generous amount of good tea. ''[[Tieguanyin]]'' is the most common accompaniment, but other teas such as ''[[pu'er tea|pu'er]]'' and ''[[oolong]]'' are also common.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Taste of Chinese Breakfast|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/Life/35510.htm|accessdate=28 June 2012}}</ref> Fried and rice-based noodles and cakes are also popular. In modern times, dim sum is commonly prepared and served in [[Yum cha|Yum Cha]] restaurants rather than at home because of the skill and efforts involved in the preparation.\n\n===Bangladesh===\nThe typical Bangladeshi breakfast consists of flour-based flat breads such as [[chapati]], [[roti]] or [[paratha]], served with a curry.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Usually the curry can be vegetable, home-fried potatoes or scrambled eggs. The breakfast varies according to location and the eater's income. In villages and rural areas, rice with curry (potato mash, dal ) is mostly preferred by day labourers. In the city, sliced bread with jam or jelly is chosen due to time efficiency. In Bangladesh tea is preferred to coffee, and is an essential part of most breakfasts.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Having toasted biscuits, bread or puffed rice with tea is also very popular.\n\n===India===\nIn all, there are at least 25 types of Indian breakfasts, each consisting of a choice of over 100 different food items.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jaffrey|first1=Madhur|title=Vegetarian India|year= 2015|publisher=Penguin Random House|location=New Delhi|url=http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/247938/vegetarian-india-by-madhur-jaffrey/9781101874868|accessdate=28 April 2017}}</ref> Each state in India has different specialties and items for breakfast.

The term originated in Britain in the mid-19th century, first used in 1896 public hygiene book ''The Sanitarian'', in which \"continent\" refers to the countries of mainland [[Europe]], though the idea had been around for a few decades as American hotels endeavored to appeal to the changing tastes of the emerging middle class and European travelers visiting America. The term refers to the type of breakfast found in places such as France and the Mediterranean, which is lighter and more delicate than the typical full English breakfast, which tends to consist of a large plate of eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, beans, and roasted mushrooms and tomatoes, and American breakfasts featuring eggs, breakfast meats, pancakes, potatoes, and toast.

''Twar\u00f3g'' can be eaten plain, with salt, sugar, or honey, or it can be mixed with [[chives]] into a [[cream cheese]]-like spread. Eggs are served often as the main breakfast item, mostly soft-boiled or scrambled. For a quick winter breakfast, hot oatmeal, to which cocoa is sometimes added, is often served. Jam spreads are popular for a quick breakfast, including plum, raspberry, and black or red [[Ribes|currant]] spreads. Breakfast drinks include coffee, milk, hot cocoa, or tea. Traditionally, the Poles avoid heavy-cooked foods for breakfast.<ref>Polish Cooking Marianna Olszewska Heberle Penguin 2005 {{ISBN|9781440624759}}</ref> For the most part, one will not see fried meats or potatoes in a classic Polish breakfast.

Sometimes the buttered bread is served savory instead of sweet, in which case the Romanians add cured meats, salami, or cheese. Another option is to spread on a slice of bread some liver p\u00e2t\u00e9.

Dating from a time when hard labour was more common, calorie intakes were necessarily higher, and servant labour was more available, it is nowadays regarded as a meal for the weekend or holidays when time is available for preparation, prepared by parents to welcome children, or as a special occasion such as a birthday or anniversary, or following a night of drinking. A healthy and nutritious version consists of grilling the protein and using poached, rather than fried, eggs, and variations based on one egg, one protein, and toast abound. It remains by far the most common choice on [[brunch]] menus and breakfast cafes across the region. The \"full Scottish breakfast\" tends to omit pork sausages and have beef sausages or lamb [[haggis]] instead. At its most extensive it consists of eggs, [[Lorne sausage|square sausage]], fried dumpling, [[potato scone]], tomato, mushrooms, bacon beef links, and [[fried bread]].

It always includes black coffee (tinto) or with milk (called pintado) with any of these sides: corn tortillas, traditional white cheese (or queso del pais), another type of tortillas or \"torrejas\" made of wheat flour known as \"[[hojaldres]].\" Another traditional breakfast side is \"[[bollo]]\" made out of either corn, white corn, or coconut that is wrapped in corn leaves and \"pre\u00f1a'o\" (meaning with child) that means it's filled with some type of meat.\n\nAs protein, a large serving of beef liver with onion, scrambled or fried eggs, beef stew or \"tasajo\" (a type of beef jerky), pork rinds and different kinds of sausages like chorizo or ''[[morcilla]]'' are the most popular. These are also accompanied by: slices of green plantain or [[cooking plantain]], \"[[patacones]]\" (double fried plantain), [[carima\u00f1ola]]s (yuca filled with meat), as well as different bread pastries both savory and sweet. These large breakfasts are normally reserved for special occasions while everyday breakfasts consist of more traditional food from the west like toast, ham, cheese, jam etc.\n\nIt is important to mention that the prolonged US presence has also influenced urban areas of Panama by introducing meals like cereal with milk as well as pancakes with syrup as traditional breakfast meals.<ref>[[:es:Desayuno#Panam\u00e1]]</ref>\n\n===United States===\n{{See also|List of American breakfast foods}}\n[[File:NYC-Diner-ToGo-Overeasy-Eggs.jpg|thumb|right|An example of an American diner breakfast, with overeasy eggs, home fries, bacon, and buttered toast]]\nThe average starting time for breakfasts in the United States has been found to be 8:12&nbsp;a.m, and varies from 8:08&nbsp;a.m. in the South to 8:17&nbsp;a.m. in the West.<ref>{{Citation|last=Larson|first=Robert B.|title=When is Dinner?|date=2002|volume=33|issue=3|pages=38\u201345|periodical=Journal of Food Distribution Research|doi=10.22004/ag.econ.26834|issn=2643-3354}}</ref> Breakfast often consists of a combination of hot or cold cereals, eggs, breakfast meats, and breakfast quick breads such as [[pancake]]s, [[waffle]]s, or [[biscuit]]s.
