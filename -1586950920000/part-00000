The population tends to be relatively young and heavily skewed gender ratio dominated by males. In many states, the number of South Asians exceeds that of the local citizenry. The four smallest states (by area), which have their entire coastlines on the Persian Gulf, exhibit the world's most extreme population growth, roughly tripling every 20 years.

Most areas are drained by ephemeral watercourses called [[wadi]]s, which are dry except during the rainy season. Plentiful ancient [[aquifer]]s exist beneath much of the peninsula, however, and where this water surfaces, [[oases]] form (e.g. Al-Hasa and [[Qatif]], two of the world's largest [[oases]]) and permit agriculture, especially [[palm trees]], which allowed the peninsula to produce more [[date palm|dates]] than any other region in the world. In general, the climate is extremely hot and [[Desert|arid]], although there are exceptions. Higher elevations are made temperate by their altitude, and the Arabian Sea coastline can receive surprisingly cool, humid breezes in summer due to cold upwelling offshore. The peninsula has no thick forests. Desert-adapted wildlife is present throughout the region.\n\nAccording to NASA's [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment]] (GRACE) satellite data (2003\u20132013) analysed in a [[University of California, Irvine|University of California, Irvine (UCI)]]-led study published in [[Water Resources Research]] on 16 June 2015, the most over-stressed aquifer system in the world is the [[Arabian Aquifer System]], upon which more than 60 million people depend for water.<ref name=\"NASA_GRACE\">{{citation |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4626 |work=NASA |date=16 June 2015 |accessdate=26 June 2015 |title=Study: Third of Big Groundwater Basins in Distress}}</ref> Twenty-one of the thirty seven largest aquifers \"have exceeded sustainability tipping points and are being depleted\" and thirteen of them are \"considered significantly distressed\".<ref name=\"NASA_GRACE\" />\n\nA plateau more than {{convert|2500|ft|m}} high extends across much of the Arabian Peninsula.

The narrow coastal plain and isolated oases, amounting to less than 1% of the land area, are used to cultivate grains, [[coffee]] and [[tropical fruit]]s. Goat, sheep, and [[camel]] husbandry is widespread elsewhere throughout the rest of the Peninsula. Some areas have a summer humid [[tropical monsoon climate]], in particular the [[Dhofar]] and [[Al Mahrah]] areas of Oman and Yemen. These areas allow for large scale coconut plantations. Much of Yemen has a tropical [[monsoon]] rain influenced mountain climate. The plains usually have either a tropical or subtropical arid [[desert climate]] or arid [[steppe climate]]. The sea surrounding the Arabian Peninsula is generally [[Coral Sea|tropical sea]] with a very rich tropical sea life and some of the world's largest, undestroyed and most pristine coral reefs. In addition, the organisms living in [[symbiosis]] with the Red Sea coral, the [[protozoa]] and [[zooxanthellae]], have a unique hot weather adaptation to sudden rise (and fall) in sea water temperature. Hence, these coral reefs are not affected by coral bleaching caused by rise in temperature as elsewhere in the [[indopacific]] coral sea. The reefs are also unaffected by mass tourism and diving or other large scale human interference. However, some reefs were destroyed in the [[Persian Gulf]], mostly caused by phosphate water [[pollution]] and resultant increase in algae growth as well as oil pollution from ships and pipeline leakage.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nThe fertile soils of Yemen have encouraged settlement of almost all of the land from sea level up to the mountains at {{convert|10000|ft|m}}. In the higher reaches, elaborate terraces have been constructed to facilitate grain, fruit, coffee, ginger and [[khat]] cultivation. The Arabian peninsula is known for its rich oil, i.e. petroleum production due to its geographical location.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Etymology==<!--linked-->\n{{main article|Arab (etymology)}}\nDuring the [[Hellenistic]] period, the area was known as ''Arabia'' or ''Aravia'' ({{lang-el|\u0391\u03c1\u03b1\u03b2\u03af\u03b1}}). The [[ancient Rome|Romans]] named three regions with the prefix \"Arabia\", encompassing a larger area than the current term \"Arabian Peninsula\":\n* [[Arabia Petraea]]: for the area that is today southern modern [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and northwestern [[Saudi Arabia]]. It was the only one that became a [[Roman province|province]], with [[Petra]] as its capital.\n* [[Arabia Deserta]] (\"Desert Arabia\"): signified the desert interior of the Arabian peninsula. As a name for the region, it remained popular into the 19th and 20th centuries, and was used in [[Charles M. Doughty]]'s ''[[Travels in Arabia Deserta]]'' (1888).\n* [[Arabia Felix]] (\"Fortunate Arabia\"): was used by geographers to describe what is now [[Yemen]], which enjoys more rainfall, is much greener than the rest of the peninsula and has long enjoyed much more productive fields.\n\nThe Arab inhabitants used a north-south division of Arabia: Al Sham-Al Yaman, or Arabia Deserta-Arabia Felix. Arabia Felix had originally been used for the whole peninsula, and at other times only for the southern region.

The [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] was born in Mecca in about 570 and first began preaching in the city in 610, but [[Hijra (Islam)|migrated]] to [[Medina]] in 622. From there he and his companions united the [[tribes of Arabia]] under the banner of [[Islam]] and created a single Arab Muslim religious polity in the Arabian peninsula.\n\nMuhammad established a new unified polity in the Arabian peninsula which under the subsequent [[Rashidun]] and [[Umayyad]] [[Caliphate]]s saw a century of rapid expansion of Arab power well beyond the Arabian peninsula in the form of a vast Muslim Arab Empire with an area of influence that stretched from the northwest [[Indian subcontinent]], across [[Central Asia]], the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], southern [[Italy]], and the [[Iberian Peninsula]], to the [[Pyrenees]].\n\nMuhammad began preaching Islam at [[Mecca]] before [[Hijra (Islam)|migrating]] to [[Medina]], from where he united the [[tribes of Arabia]] into a singular Arab Muslim religious polity. With Muhammad's death in 632 AD, disagreement broke out over who would succeed him as leader of the Muslim community. [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]], a prominent [[sahaba|companion]] of Muhammad, nominated [[Abu Bakr]], who was Muhammad's intimate friend and collaborator. Others added their support and Abu Bakr was made the first [[caliph]]. This choice was disputed by some of Muhammad's companions, who held that [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]], his cousin and son-in-law, had been designated his successor. Abu Bakr's immediate task was to avenge a recent defeat by [[Byzantine]] (or [[Eastern Roman Empire]]) forces, although he first had to put down a rebellion by Arab tribes in an episode known as the [[Ridda wars]], or \"Wars of Apostasy\".<ref>See:\n* Holt (1977a), p.57\n* Hourani (2003), p.22\n* Lapidus (2002), p.32\n* Madelung (1996), p.43\n* Tabatabaei (1979), p.30\u201350</ref>\n\nFollowing Muhammad's death in 632, [[Abu Bakr]] became leader of the Muslims as the first [[Caliph]]. After putting down a rebellion by the Arab tribes (known as the [[Ridda wars]], or \"Wars of Apostasy\"), Abu Bakr attacked the [[Byzantine Empire]]. On his death in 634, he was succeeded by [[Umar]] as caliph, followed by [[Uthman ibn al-Affan]] and [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]]. The period of these first four caliphs is known as ''al-khulaf\u0101' ar-r\u0101shid\u016bn'': the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun or \"rightly guided\" Caliphate]]. Under the Rashidun Caliphs, and, from 661, their [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad successors]], the Arabs rapidly expanded the territory under Muslim control outside of Arabia. In a matter of decades Muslim armies decisively defeated the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine army]] and destroyed the [[Sassanid Empire|Persian Empire]], [[Muslim conquests|conquering huge swathes of territory]] from the [[Iberian peninsula]] to India.

Their domain originally comprised only the holy cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] but in the 13th century it was extended to include the rest of the [[Hejaz]]. Although, the Sharifs exercised at most times independent authority in the [[Hejaz]], they were usually subject to the [[suzerainty]] of one of the major Islamic empires of the time.

Another important goal was to improve the economic and political integration of the distant Arabian provinces into the Ottoman state, and to facilitate the transportation of military troops in case of need.\n\nThe [[Hejaz Railway]] was a [[narrow gauge railway]] ({{convert|1050|km|mile|abbr=on}}) that ran from [[Damascus]] to [[Medina]], through the Hejaz region of Arabia. It was originally planned to reach the holy city of [[Mecca]], but due to the interruption of the construction works caused by the outbreak of World War I, it eventually only reached Medina. It was a part of the [[Turkish State Railways#Ottoman railways|Ottoman railway]] network and was built in order to extend the previously existing line between Istanbul and Damascus (which began from the [[Haydarpa\u015fa Terminal]]).\n\nThe railway was started in 1900 at the behest of the Ottoman Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] and was built largely by the [[Turkey|Turk]]s, with [[German Empire|German]] advice and support. A public subscription was opened throughout the Islamic world to fund the construction. The railway was to be a [[waqf]], an inalienable religious endowment or charitable trust.<ref>King Hussein and the Kingdom of Hejaz, Randall Baker, Oleander Press 1979, {{ISBN|0-900891-48-3}}, page 18</ref>\n\n====The Arab Revolt and the foundation of Saudi Arabia====\nThe major developments of the early 20th century were the [[Arab Revolt]] during World War I and the subsequent collapse and [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]]. The Arab Revolt (1916\u20131918) was initiated by the [[Sherif Hussein ibn Ali]] with the aim of securing independence from the ruling [[Ottoman Empire]] and creating a single unified Arab state spanning from [[Aleppo]] in [[Syria]] to [[Aden]] in Yemen. During World War I, the Sharif Hussein entered into an alliance with the United Kingdom and France against the Ottomans in June 1916.\n\nThese events were followed by the [[foundation of Saudi Arabia]] under King [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|Abdulaziz Ibn Saud]]. In 1902, Ibn Saud had captured [[Riyadh]]. Continuing his conquests, Abdulaziz subdued Al-Hasa, [[Emirate of Jabal Shammar|Jabal Shammar]], [[Kingdom of Hejaz|Hejaz]] between 1913 and 1926 founded the modern state of [[Saudi Arabia]]. The Saudis absorbed the [[Idrisid Emirate of Asir|Emirate of Asir]], with their expansion only ending in 1934 after a [[Saudi\u2013Yemeni War (1934)|war with Yemen]]. Two Saudi states were formed and controlled much of Arabia before Ibn Saud was even born. Ibn Saud, however, established the third Saudi state.\n\n====Oil reserves====\nThe second major development has been the discovery of vast reserves of oil in the 1930s. Its production brought great wealth to all countries of the region, with the exception of [[Yemen]].\n\n====Civil war in Yemen====\nThe [[North Yemen Civil War]] was fought in [[North Yemen]] between royalists of the [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen]] and factions of the [[Yemen Arab Republic]] from 1962 to 1970. The war began with a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] carried out by the republican leader, [[Abdullah as-Sallal]], which dethroned the newly crowned [[Muhammad al-Badr]] and declared Yemen a republic under his presidency. The Imam escaped to the [[Saudi Arabia]]n border and rallied popular support.\n\nThe royalist side received support from Saudi Arabia, while the republicans were supported by [[Egypt]] and the Soviet Union. Both foreign irregular and conventional forces were also involved. The [[President of Egypt|Egyptian President]], [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], supported the republicans with as many as 70,000 troops. Despite several military moves and peace conferences, the war sank into a stalemate. Egypt's commitment to the war is considered to have been detrimental to its performance in the [[Six-Day War]] of June 1967, after which Nasser found it increasingly difficult to maintain his army's involvement and began to pull his forces out of Yemen.\n\nBy 1970, King [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia]] recognized the republic and a truce was signed.

Most areas are drained by ephemeral watercourses called [[wadi]]s, which are dry except during the rainy season. Plentiful ancient [[aquifer]]s exist beneath much of the peninsula, however, and where this water surfaces, [[oases]] form (e.g. Al-Hasa and [[Qatif]], two of the world's largest [[oases]]) and permit agriculture, especially [[palm trees]], which allowed the peninsula to produce more [[date palm|dates]] than any other region in the world. In general, the climate is extremely hot and [[Desert|arid]], although there are exceptions. Higher elevations are made temperate by their altitude, and the Arabian Sea coastline can receive surprisingly cool, humid breezes in summer due to cold upwelling offshore. The peninsula has no thick forests. Desert-adapted wildlife is present throughout the region.\n\nAccording to NASA's [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment]] (GRACE) satellite data (2003\u20132013) analysed in a [[University of California, Irvine|University of California, Irvine (UCI)]]-led study published in [[Water Resources Research]] on 16 June 2015, the most over-stressed aquifer system in the world is the [[Arabian Aquifer System]], upon which more than 60 million people depend for water.<ref name=\"NASA_GRACE\">{{citation |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4626 |work=NASA |date=16 June 2015 |accessdate=26 June 2015 |title=Study: Third of Big Groundwater Basins in Distress}}</ref> Twenty-one of the thirty seven largest aquifers \"have exceeded sustainability tipping points and are being depleted\" and thirteen of them are \"considered significantly distressed\".<ref name=\"NASA_GRACE\" />\n\nA plateau more than {{convert|2500|ft|m}} high extends across much of the Arabian Peninsula.

The narrow coastal plain and isolated oases, amounting to less than 1% of the land area, are used to cultivate grains, [[coffee]] and [[tropical fruit]]s. Goat, sheep, and [[camel]] husbandry is widespread elsewhere throughout the rest of the Peninsula. Some areas have a summer humid [[tropical monsoon climate]], in particular the [[Dhofar]] and [[Al Mahrah]] areas of Oman and Yemen. These areas allow for large scale coconut plantations. Much of Yemen has a tropical [[monsoon]] rain influenced mountain climate. The plains usually have either a tropical or subtropical arid [[desert climate]] or arid [[steppe climate]]. The sea surrounding the Arabian Peninsula is generally [[Coral Sea|tropical sea]] with a very rich tropical sea life and some of the world's largest, undestroyed and most pristine coral reefs. In addition, the organisms living in [[symbiosis]] with the Red Sea coral, the [[protozoa]] and [[zooxanthellae]], have a unique hot weather adaptation to sudden rise (and fall) in sea water temperature. Hence, these coral reefs are not affected by coral bleaching caused by rise in temperature as elsewhere in the [[indopacific]] coral sea. The reefs are also unaffected by mass tourism and diving or other large scale human interference. However, some reefs were destroyed in the [[Persian Gulf]], mostly caused by phosphate water [[pollution]] and resultant increase in algae growth as well as oil pollution from ships and pipeline leakage.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nThe fertile soils of Yemen have encouraged settlement of almost all of the land from sea level up to the mountains at {{convert|10000|ft|m}}. In the higher reaches, elaborate terraces have been constructed to facilitate grain, fruit, coffee, ginger and [[khat]] cultivation. The Arabian peninsula is known for its rich oil, i.e. petroleum production due to its geographical location.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Etymology==<!--linked-->\n{{main article|Arab (etymology)}}\nDuring the [[Hellenistic]] period, the area was known as ''Arabia'' or ''Aravia'' ({{lang-el|\u0391\u03c1\u03b1\u03b2\u03af\u03b1}}). The [[ancient Rome|Romans]] named three regions with the prefix \"Arabia\", encompassing a larger area than the current term \"Arabian Peninsula\":\n* [[Arabia Petraea]]: for the area that is today southern modern [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and northwestern [[Saudi Arabia]]. It was the only one that became a [[Roman province|province]], with [[Petra]] as its capital.\n* [[Arabia Deserta]] (\"Desert Arabia\"): signified the desert interior of the Arabian peninsula. As a name for the region, it remained popular into the 19th and 20th centuries, and was used in [[Charles M. Doughty]]'s ''[[Travels in Arabia Deserta]]'' (1888).\n* [[Arabia Felix]] (\"Fortunate Arabia\"): was used by geographers to describe what is now [[Yemen]], which enjoys more rainfall, is much greener than the rest of the peninsula and has long enjoyed much more productive fields.\n\nThe Arab inhabitants used a north-south division of Arabia: Al Sham-Al Yaman, or Arabia Deserta-Arabia Felix. Arabia Felix had originally been used for the whole peninsula, and at other times only for the southern region. Because its use became limited to the south, the whole peninsula was simply called Arabia. Arabia Deserta was the entire desert region extending north from Arabia Felix to Palmyra and the Euphrates, including all the area between Pelusium on the Nile and Babylon. This area was also called Arabia and not sharply distinguished from the peninsula.<ref>See [https://books.google.com/books?id=3yENB_dXAtwC&pg=PA163 ''Pilgrimage and Holy Space in Late Antique Egypt''], David Frankfurter, BRILL, 1998, {{ISBN|90-04-11127-1}}, page 163</ref>\n\nThe Arabs and the Ottoman Empire considered the west of the Arabian Peninsula region where the Arabs lived 'the land of the Arabs' \u2013 Bilad al-Arab (Arabia), and its major divisions were the bilad al-Sham (Syria), bilad al-Yaman (the Land of the southern Peninsula), and Bilad al-Iraq and modern-day Kuwait (the Land of the River Banks).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4vOJ15vTZV4C&lpg=PA60&pg=PA60|title=A House of Many Mansions: The History of Lebanon Reconsidered |first=Kamal Suleiman |last=Salibi |publisher=University of California Press |date=1988 |isbn=978-0-520-07196-4 |pages=60\u201361 }}</ref> The Ottomans used the term Arabistan in a broad sense for the region starting from [[Cilicia]], where the Euphrates river makes its descent into [[Syria]], through [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and on through the remainder of the Sinai and Arabian peninsulas.<ref>See for example Palestine: The Reality, [[Joseph Mary Nagle Jeffries]], Published by Longmans, Green and co., 1939, [https://archive.org/details/PalestineTheReality/page/n4/mode/1up Page 11]</ref>\n\n''The provinces of Arabia were:'' Al Tih, the Sinai peninsula, Hedjaz, Asir, Yemen, Hadramaut, Mahra and Shilu, Oman, Hasa, Bahrain, Dahna, Nufud, the Hammad, which included the deserts of Syria, Mesopotamia and Babylonia.<ref>see Review of Reviews and World's Work: An International Magazine, Albert Shaw ed., The Review of Reviews Corporation, 1919, page 408]</ref><ref name=nie>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GRUoAAAAYAAJ&lpg=PA795&pg=PA795|title=New International Encyclopedia \u2013 2nd Edition, Dodd, Mead, Co., 1914 |page= 795|work=google.com|year=1914 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:HistoricCoins.jpg|thumb|Ancient coins from [[Failaka Island]], [[Kuwait]]]]\nThe history of the Arabian Peninsula goes back to the beginnings of human habitation in Arabia up to 130,000 years ago.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Uerpmann|first=Hans-Peter|last2=Usik|first2=Vitaly I.|last3=Parker|first3=Adrian G.|last4=Marks|first4=Anthony E.|last5=Jasim|first5=Sabah A.|last6=Armitage|first6=Simon J.|date=2011-01-28|title=The Southern Route \"Out of Africa\": Evidence for an Early Expansion of Modern Humans into Arabia|journal=Science|language=en|volume=331|issue=6016|pages=453\u2013456|doi=10.1126/science.1199113|issn=0036-8075|pmid=21273486}}</ref> However, a [[Homo sapiens]] fossilized finger bone was found at [[Al Wusta (Saudi Arabia)|Al Wusta]] in the [[Nefud Desert]], which indicates that the first human migration out of Africa to Arabia might date back to approximately 90,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-04/mpif-fhm040418.php|title=First human migration out of Africa more geographically widespread than previously thought|work=Eurek Alert|date=9 April 2018}}</ref> Nevertheless, the stone tools from the [[Middle Paleolithic]] age along with fossils of other animals discovered at Ti's al Ghadah, in northwestern Saudi Arabia, might imply that hominids migrated through a \"Green Arabia\" between 300,000 and 500,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Roberts | first1=Patrick | last2=Stewart | first2=Mathew | last3=Alagaili | first3=Abdulaziz N. | last4=Breeze | first4=Paul | last5=Candy | first5=Ian | last6=Drake | first6=Nick | last7=Groucutt | first7=Huw S. | last8=Scerri | first8=Eleanor M.

The [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] was born in Mecca in about 570 and first began preaching in the city in 610, but [[Hijra (Islam)|migrated]] to [[Medina]] in 622. From there he and his companions united the [[tribes of Arabia]] under the banner of [[Islam]] and created a single Arab Muslim religious polity in the Arabian peninsula.\n\nMuhammad established a new unified polity in the Arabian peninsula which under the subsequent [[Rashidun]] and [[Umayyad]] [[Caliphate]]s saw a century of rapid expansion of Arab power well beyond the Arabian peninsula in the form of a vast Muslim Arab Empire with an area of influence that stretched from the northwest [[Indian subcontinent]], across [[Central Asia]], the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], southern [[Italy]], and the [[Iberian Peninsula]], to the [[Pyrenees]].\n\nMuhammad began preaching Islam at [[Mecca]] before [[Hijra (Islam)|migrating]] to [[Medina]], from where he united the [[tribes of Arabia]] into a singular Arab Muslim religious polity. With Muhammad's death in 632 AD, disagreement broke out over who would succeed him as leader of the Muslim community. [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]], a prominent [[sahaba|companion]] of Muhammad, nominated [[Abu Bakr]], who was Muhammad's intimate friend and collaborator. Others added their support and Abu Bakr was made the first [[caliph]]. This choice was disputed by some of Muhammad's companions, who held that [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]], his cousin and son-in-law, had been designated his successor. Abu Bakr's immediate task was to avenge a recent defeat by [[Byzantine]] (or [[Eastern Roman Empire]]) forces, although he first had to put down a rebellion by Arab tribes in an episode known as the [[Ridda wars]], or \"Wars of Apostasy\".<ref>See:\n* Holt (1977a), p.57\n* Hourani (2003), p.22\n* Lapidus (2002), p.32\n* Madelung (1996), p.43\n* Tabatabaei (1979), p.30\u201350</ref>\n\nFollowing Muhammad's death in 632, [[Abu Bakr]] became leader of the Muslims as the first [[Caliph]]. After putting down a rebellion by the Arab tribes (known as the [[Ridda wars]], or \"Wars of Apostasy\"), Abu Bakr attacked the [[Byzantine Empire]]. On his death in 634, he was succeeded by [[Umar]] as caliph, followed by [[Uthman ibn al-Affan]] and [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]]. The period of these first four caliphs is known as ''al-khulaf\u0101' ar-r\u0101shid\u016bn'': the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun or \"rightly guided\" Caliphate]]. Under the Rashidun Caliphs, and, from 661, their [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad successors]], the Arabs rapidly expanded the territory under Muslim control outside of Arabia. In a matter of decades Muslim armies decisively defeated the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine army]] and destroyed the [[Sassanid Empire|Persian Empire]], [[Muslim conquests|conquering huge swathes of territory]] from the [[Iberian peninsula]] to India.

Arabs living in one of the existing districts of the Arabian peninsula, the Emirate of [[Hejaz]], asked for a British guarantee of independence. Their proposal included all Arab lands south of a line roughly corresponding to the northern frontiers of present-day Syria and Iraq. They envisioned a new Arab state, or confederation of states, adjoining the southern Arabian Peninsula.

Another important goal was to improve the economic and political integration of the distant Arabian provinces into the Ottoman state, and to facilitate the transportation of military troops in case of need.\n\nThe [[Hejaz Railway]] was a [[narrow gauge railway]] ({{convert|1050|km|mile|abbr=on}}) that ran from [[Damascus]] to [[Medina]], through the Hejaz region of Arabia. It was originally planned to reach the holy city of [[Mecca]], but due to the interruption of the construction works caused by the outbreak of World War I, it eventually only reached Medina. It was a part of the [[Turkish State Railways#Ottoman railways|Ottoman railway]] network and was built in order to extend the previously existing line between Istanbul and Damascus (which began from the [[Haydarpa\u015fa Terminal]]).\n\nThe railway was started in 1900 at the behest of the Ottoman Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] and was built largely by the [[Turkey|Turk]]s, with [[German Empire|German]] advice and support. A public subscription was opened throughout the Islamic world to fund the construction. The railway was to be a [[waqf]], an inalienable religious endowment or charitable trust.<ref>King Hussein and the Kingdom of Hejaz, Randall Baker, Oleander Press 1979, {{ISBN|0-900891-48-3}}, page 18</ref>\n\n====The Arab Revolt and the foundation of Saudi Arabia====\nThe major developments of the early 20th century were the [[Arab Revolt]] during World War I and the subsequent collapse and [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]]. The Arab Revolt (1916\u20131918) was initiated by the [[Sherif Hussein ibn Ali]] with the aim of securing independence from the ruling [[Ottoman Empire]] and creating a single unified Arab state spanning from [[Aleppo]] in [[Syria]] to [[Aden]] in Yemen. During World War I, the Sharif Hussein entered into an alliance with the United Kingdom and France against the Ottomans in June 1916.\n\nThese events were followed by the [[foundation of Saudi Arabia]] under King [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|Abdulaziz Ibn Saud]]. In 1902, Ibn Saud had captured [[Riyadh]]. Continuing his conquests, Abdulaziz subdued Al-Hasa, [[Emirate of Jabal Shammar|Jabal Shammar]], [[Kingdom of Hejaz|Hejaz]] between 1913 and 1926 founded the modern state of [[Saudi Arabia]]. The Saudis absorbed the [[Idrisid Emirate of Asir|Emirate of Asir]], with their expansion only ending in 1934 after a [[Saudi\u2013Yemeni War (1934)|war with Yemen]]. Two Saudi states were formed and controlled much of Arabia before Ibn Saud was even born. Ibn Saud, however, established the third Saudi state.\n\n====Oil reserves====\nThe second major development has been the discovery of vast reserves of oil in the 1930s. Its production brought great wealth to all countries of the region, with the exception of [[Yemen]].\n\n====Civil war in Yemen====\nThe [[North Yemen Civil War]] was fought in [[North Yemen]] between royalists of the [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen]] and factions of the [[Yemen Arab Republic]] from 1962 to 1970. The war began with a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] carried out by the republican leader, [[Abdullah as-Sallal]], which dethroned the newly crowned [[Muhammad al-Badr]] and declared Yemen a republic under his presidency. The Imam escaped to the [[Saudi Arabia]]n border and rallied popular support.\n\nThe royalist side received support from Saudi Arabia, while the republicans were supported by [[Egypt]] and the Soviet Union. Both foreign irregular and conventional forces were also involved. The [[President of Egypt|Egyptian President]], [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], supported the republicans with as many as 70,000 troops. Despite several military moves and peace conferences, the war sank into a stalemate. Egypt's commitment to the war is considered to have been detrimental to its performance in the [[Six-Day War]] of June 1967, after which Nasser found it increasingly difficult to maintain his army's involvement and began to pull his forces out of Yemen.\n\nBy 1970, King [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia]] recognized the republic and a truce was signed. Egyptian military historians refer to the war in Yemen as their [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]].<ref name=enein>{{Cite news |issue=Jan\u2013Feb, 2004 |last=Aboul-Enein |first=Youssef |title=The Egyptian-Yemen War: Egyptian perspectives on Guerrilla warfare |work=Infantry Magazine |access-date=October 3, 2008 |date=2004-01-01 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0IAV/is_1_93/ai_n6123802 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203161830/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0IAV/is_1_93/ai_n6123802 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-02-03}}</ref>\n\n====Gulf War====\nIn 1990, [[Iraq]] invaded Kuwait.<ref>see Richard Schofield, Kuwait and Iraq: Historical Claims and Territorial.

The term \"soft drink\" specifies the absence of alcohol in contrast to \"hard drink\" and \"drink\".

Citrus products such as [[orange juice]] and [[tangerine]] juice are familiar breakfast drinks, while [[grapefruit juice]], pineapple, apple, grape, lime, and lemon juice are also common. [[Coconut water]] is a highly nutritious and refreshing juice. Many kinds of berries are crushed; their juices are mixed with water and sometimes sweetened. Raspberry, blackberry and currants are popular juices drinks but the percentage of water also determines their nutritive value. Grape juice allowed to ferment produces [[wine]].\n\nFruits are highly perishable so the ability to extract juices and store them was of significant value. Some fruits are highly acidic and mixing them with water and sugars or honey was often necessary to make them palatable. Early storage of fruit juices was labor-intensive, requiring the crushing of the fruits and the mixing of the resulting pure juices with sugars before bottling.\n\nVegetable juices are usually served warm or cold. Different types of vegetables can be used to make vegetable juice such as [[carrot]]s, tomatoes, [[cucumber]]s, [[celery]] and many more. Some vegetable juices are mixed with some fruit juice to make the vegetable juice taste better. Many popular vegetable juices, particularly ones with high tomato content, are high in sodium, and therefore consumption of them for health must be carefully considered. Some vegetable juices provide the same health benefits as whole vegetables in terms of reducing risks of [[cardiovascular disease]] and [[cancer]].\n{{clear}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This includes caf\u00e9s and [[coffeehouse]]s, focus on providing hot drinks as well as light snacks. Many coffee houses in the [[Middle East]], and in [[West Asia]]n immigrant districts in the [[Western world]], offer ''shisha'' (''nargile'' in Turkish and Greek), flavored tobacco smoked through a [[hookah]]. [[coffeehouse#Espresso bars|Espresso bars]] are a type of coffeehouse that specialize in serving [[espresso]] and espresso-based drinks.\n\nIn China and Japan, the establishment would be a [[tea house]], were people would socialise whilst drinking tea. Chinese scholars have used the teahouse for places of sharing ideas.\n\nAlcoholic drinks are served in [[drinking establishments]], which have different cultural connotations. For example, [[pub]]s are fundamental to the culture of [[British culture|Britain]],<ref name=\"EB\">[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482410/public-house Public House] Britannica.com; Subscription Required.

In many places, especially in villages, a pub can be the focal point of the community. The writings of [[Samuel Pepys]] describe the pub as the heart of England. Many pubs are controlled by breweries, so [[cask ale]] or [[keg beer]] may be a better value than wines and spirits.\n\nIn contrast, types of bars range from seedy bars or nightclubs, sometimes termed \"dive bars\",<ref>Todd Dayton, {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=LpUSVjBPHRwC&pg=PT7&dq=the+ideal+dive#v=onepage&q=the%20ideal%20dive&f=false |title=''San Francisco's Best Dive Bars'', page 4 |publisher=Ig Publishing |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-9703125-8-7 |accessdate=2010-07-22 }}</ref> to elegant places of entertainment for the elite. Bars provide [[Bar stool|stools]] or chairs that are placed at tables or counters for their patrons. The term \"bar\" is derived from the [[bar (counter)|specialized counter]] on which drinks are served. Some bars have entertainment on a stage, such as a live band, comedians, [[Go-Go dancing|go-go dancers]], or [[striptease|strippers]]. Patrons may sit or stand at the bar and be served by the [[bartender]], or they may sit at tables and be served by cocktail servers.\n\n=== Matching with food ===\n{{Main|Wine and food matching}}\n[[File:Champagne flute and bottle.jpg|thumb|upright|Champagne flute and bottle]]\n[[Food]] and drink are often paired together to enhance the taste experience.

This is sometimes purely for presentations purposes, such as for cocktails. In other situations, the drinkware has practical application, such as coffee cups which are designed for insulation or [[snifter|brandy snifters]] which are designed to encourage evaporation but trap the aroma within the glass.\n\nMany glasses include a stem, which allows the drinker to hold the glass without affecting the temperature of the drink. In champagne glasses, the bowl is designed to retain champagne's signature [[carbonation]], by reducing the [[surface area]] at the opening of the bowl. Historically, champagne has been served in a [[champagne coupe]], the shape of which allowed carbonation to dissipate even more rapidly than from a standard [[wine glass]].\n\n== Commercial trade ==\n\n=== International exports and imports ===\n\nAn important export commodity, coffee was the top agricultural export for twelve countries in 2004,<ref>{{cite web |title=FAO Statistical Yearbook 2004 Vol. 1/1 Table C.10: Most important imports and exports of agricultural products (in value terms) (2004) |publisher=FAO Statistics Division |year=2006 |url=http://www.fao.org/statistics/yearbook/vol_1_1/pdf/c10.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625174054/http://www.fao.org/statistics/yearbook/vol_1_1/pdf/c10.pdf |archivedate=2008-06-25 |accessdate=September 13, 2007 }}</ref>\nand it was the world's seventh-largest legal agricultural export by value in 2005.<ref>{{cite web |title=FAOSTAT Core Trade Data (commodities/years) |publisher=FAO Statistics Division |year=2007 |url=http://faostat.fao.org/site/343/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=343| accessdate=October 24, 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071014183239/http://faostat.fao.org/site/343/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=343| archivedate = October 14, 2007}} To retrieve export values: Select the \"commodities/years\" tab.

Citrus products such as [[orange juice]] and [[tangerine]] juice are familiar breakfast drinks, while [[grapefruit juice]], pineapple, apple, grape, lime, and lemon juice are also common. [[Coconut water]] is a highly nutritious and refreshing juice. Many kinds of berries are crushed; their juices are mixed with water and sometimes sweetened. Raspberry, blackberry and currants are popular juices drinks but the percentage of water also determines their nutritive value. Grape juice allowed to ferment produces [[wine]].\n\nFruits are highly perishable so the ability to extract juices and store them was of significant value. Some fruits are highly acidic and mixing them with water and sugars or honey was often necessary to make them palatable. Early storage of fruit juices was labor-intensive, requiring the crushing of the fruits and the mixing of the resulting pure juices with sugars before bottling.\n\nVegetable juices are usually served warm or cold. Different types of vegetables can be used to make vegetable juice such as [[carrot]]s, tomatoes, [[cucumber]]s, [[celery]] and many more. Some vegetable juices are mixed with some fruit juice to make the vegetable juice taste better. Many popular vegetable juices, particularly ones with high tomato content, are high in sodium, and therefore consumption of them for health must be carefully considered. Some vegetable juices provide the same health benefits as whole vegetables in terms of reducing risks of [[cardiovascular disease]] and [[cancer]].\n{{clear}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Until the 19th century, hot chocolate was even used medicinally to treat ailments such as liver and stomach diseases.\n\nHot chocolate is consumed throughout the world and comes in multiple variations, including the spiced ''chocolate para mesa'' of Latin America, the very thick ''cioccolata calda'' served in Italy and ''chocolate a la taza'' served in Spain, and the thinner hot cocoa consumed in the United States. Prepared hot chocolate can be purchased from a range of establishments, including [[cafeteria]]s, [[fast food restaurant]]s, [[coffeehouse]]s and [[teahouse]]s.

Tea is also served differently from country to country: in [[China]] and [[Japan]] tiny cups are used to serve tea; in Thailand and the United States tea is often served cold (as \"iced tea\") or with a lot of sweetener; Indians boil tea with milk and a blend of spices as [[masala chai]]; tea is brewed with a [[samovar]] in Iran, [[Kashmir]], Russia and Turkey; and in the Australian [[Outback]] it is traditionally brewed in a [[billycan]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Saberi|first=Helen|title=Tea: A Global History|publisher=Reaktion Books|year=2010|pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781861897763/page/7 7]|isbn=978-1-86189-892-0|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781861897763|url-access=registration}}</ref>\nTea leaves can be processed in different ways resulting in a drink which appears and tastes different.

This includes caf\u00e9s and [[coffeehouse]]s, focus on providing hot drinks as well as light snacks. Many coffee houses in the [[Middle East]], and in [[West Asia]]n immigrant districts in the [[Western world]], offer ''shisha'' (''nargile'' in Turkish and Greek), flavored tobacco smoked through a [[hookah]]. [[coffeehouse#Espresso bars|Espresso bars]] are a type of coffeehouse that specialize in serving [[espresso]] and espresso-based drinks.\n\nIn China and Japan, the establishment would be a [[tea house]], were people would socialise whilst drinking tea. Chinese scholars have used the teahouse for places of sharing ideas.\n\nAlcoholic drinks are served in [[drinking establishments]], which have different cultural connotations. For example, [[pub]]s are fundamental to the culture of [[British culture|Britain]],<ref name=\"EB\">[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482410/public-house Public House] Britannica.com; Subscription Required.

In many places, especially in villages, a pub can be the focal point of the community. The writings of [[Samuel Pepys]] describe the pub as the heart of England. Many pubs are controlled by breweries, so [[cask ale]] or [[keg beer]] may be a better value than wines and spirits.\n\nIn contrast, types of bars range from seedy bars or nightclubs, sometimes termed \"dive bars\",<ref>Todd Dayton, {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=LpUSVjBPHRwC&pg=PT7&dq=the+ideal+dive#v=onepage&q=the%20ideal%20dive&f=false |title=''San Francisco's Best Dive Bars'', page 4 |publisher=Ig Publishing |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-9703125-8-7 |accessdate=2010-07-22 }}</ref> to elegant places of entertainment for the elite. Bars provide [[Bar stool|stools]] or chairs that are placed at tables or counters for their patrons. The term \"bar\" is derived from the [[bar (counter)|specialized counter]] on which drinks are served. Some bars have entertainment on a stage, such as a live band, comedians, [[Go-Go dancing|go-go dancers]], or [[striptease|strippers]]. Patrons may sit or stand at the bar and be served by the [[bartender]], or they may sit at tables and be served by cocktail servers.\n\n=== Matching with food ===\n{{Main|Wine and food matching}}\n[[File:Champagne flute and bottle.jpg|thumb|upright|Champagne flute and bottle]]\n[[Food]] and drink are often paired together to enhance the taste experience. This primarily happens with wine and a culture has grown up around the process. Weight, flavors and textures can either be contrasted or complemented.<ref name=\"Oldman pg 219-235\">M. Oldman \"Oldman's Guide to Outsmarting Wine\" pg 219-235 Penguin Books 2004 {{ISBN|0-14-200492-8}}</ref> In recent years, food magazines began to suggest particular wines with recipes and restaurants would offer multi-course dinners matched with a specific wine for each course.<ref name=\"MacNeil pg 83-88\">K. MacNeil ''The Wine Bible'' pg 83-88 Workman Publishing 2001 {{ISBN|1-56305-434-5}}</ref>\n\n=== Presentation ===\nDifferent drinks have unique receptacles for their consumption. This is sometimes purely for presentations purposes, such as for cocktails. In other situations, the drinkware has practical application, such as coffee cups which are designed for insulation or [[snifter|brandy snifters]] which are designed to encourage evaporation but trap the aroma within the glass.\n\nMany glasses include a stem, which allows the drinker to hold the glass without affecting the temperature of the drink. In champagne glasses, the bowl is designed to retain champagne's signature [[carbonation]], by reducing the [[surface area]] at the opening of the bowl. Historically, champagne has been served in a [[champagne coupe]], the shape of which allowed carbonation to dissipate even more rapidly than from a standard [[wine glass]].\n\n== Commercial trade ==\n\n=== International exports and imports ===\n\nAn important export commodity, coffee was the top agricultural export for twelve countries in 2004,<ref>{{cite web |title=FAO Statistical Yearbook 2004 Vol. 1/1 Table C.10: Most important imports and exports of agricultural products (in value terms) (2004) |publisher=FAO Statistics Division |year=2006 |url=http://www.fao.org/statistics/yearbook/vol_1_1/pdf/c10.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625174054/http://www.fao.org/statistics/yearbook/vol_1_1/pdf/c10.pdf |archivedate=2008-06-25 |accessdate=September 13, 2007 }}</ref>\nand it was the world's seventh-largest legal agricultural export by value in 2005.<ref>{{cite web |title=FAOSTAT Core Trade Data (commodities/years) |publisher=FAO Statistics Division |year=2007 |url=http://faostat.fao.org/site/343/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=343| accessdate=October 24, 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071014183239/http://faostat.fao.org/site/343/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=343| archivedate = October 14, 2007}} To retrieve export values: Select the \"commodities/years\" tab.

One night, on his way to buy dinner, he stops to take a photo to upload to Twitter. A strange high school girl named Fuuka Akitsuki accidentally bumps into him and mistakenly believes that Yuu is trying to take a photo of her panties, which causes her to smash his phone. Fuuka leaves behind a CD, which Yuu returns the following day. Appreciating Yuu's personality, Fuuka starts a relationship with him, but this is complicated when Koyuki, now a popular idol, contacts Yuu on Twitter and invites him to attend her concert.\n\n==Characters==\n===Main characters===\n;{{Nihongo|Yuu Haruna|\u699b\u540d \u512a|Haruna Y\u016b}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u016bsuke Kobayashi (voice actor)|Y\u016bsuke Kobayashi]]<ref name=\"cast\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2016/11/11-1/fuuka-anime-cast-staff-and-broadcast-plans-spotted |title=\"Fuuka\" Anime Cast, Staff And Broadcast Plans Spotted |website=[[Crunchyroll]]|date=11 November 2016 |accessdate=12 November 2016 }}</ref>|[[Aaron Dismuke]]<ref name=\"dub cast\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.funimation.com/blog/2017/01/03/official-winter-2017-simuldub-lineup/#fuuka|title=Official Winter 2017 Simuldub Lineup |publisher=[[Funimation]] |date=12 January 2017 |accessdate=12 January 2017 }}</ref>}}\n:Yuu is bassist of the band The Fallen Moon (later renamed Blue Wells).

The ceremony was held in [[Westminster Abbey]] after a public procession through the streets from [[Buckingham Palace]], to which the Queen returned later as part of a second procession.\n\nPlanning for the coronation, led by the prime minister, [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]], began at [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] level in March 1838. In the face of various objections from numerous parties, the Cabinet announced on Saturday, 7 April, that the coronation would be at the end of the [[Legislative session|parliamentary session]] in June. It was budgeted at  \u00a370,000, which was more than double the cost of the \"cut-price\" 1831 coronation, but considerably less than the \u00a3240,000 spent when [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] was crowned in July 1821. A key element of the plan was presentation of the event to a wider public.\n\nBy 1838, the [[History of rail transport in Great Britain 1830\u20131922|newly built railways]] were able to deliver huge numbers of people into London and it has been estimated that some 400,000 visitors arrived to swell the crowds who thronged the streets while the two processions took place and filled the parks where catering and entertainment were provided. [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] was the scene of a huge fair, including a [[Balloon (aeronautics)|balloon ascent]]. The fair was scheduled to take place over two days, but was in the end extended by popular demand to four days. [[Green Park]] featured a [[Fireworks|firework display]] the night after the ceremony. The coronation coincided with a period of fine weather and the whole event was generally considered a great success by both the press and the wider public, although those inside the Abbey witnessed a good deal of mishap and confusion, largely due to lack of rehearsal time. In the country at large, there was considerable opposition to the coronation by [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicals]], especially in [[Northern England|the North of England]].\n\n==Background and planning==\nQueen Victoria succeeded her uncle [[King William IV]] on 20 June 1837.<ref>{{harvnb|Worsley|2018|p=81}}.</ref> Her first [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]] was [[Lord Melbourne]], with whom she developed a close personal friendship.<ref>{{harvnb|Worsley|2018|pages=86\u201387}}.</ref> Until 1867, the [[Demise of the Crown]] automatically triggered the [[dissolution of parliament]]: voting in the subsequent [[1837 United Kingdom general election|general election]] took place between 24 July and 18 August. The result was a victory for Melbourne, whose [[British Whig Party|Whig Party]] government was returned to power for another four years. Their majority over the opposition [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative (formerly Tory) Party]] was reduced from 112 seats to 30. Melbourne was the leading player in the planning, preparation and implementation of Victoria's coronation.<ref name=\"RS\">{{cite web |url=http://www.queenvictoriasjournals.org/info/QueenVictoriasCoronation.do |title=Queen Victoria's Coronation |author1-link=Roy Strong |author1-last=Strong |author1-first=Roy |website=Queen Victoria's Journals |publisher=Royal Archives |accessdate=8 April 2019}}{{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nMelbourne's Cabinet began formal discussions of the subject of the coronation during March 1838.<ref name=\"LW94\">{{harvnb|Worsley|2018|p=94}}.</ref> A major factor in the planning was that the coronation was the first to be held since the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Act of 1832]], when the government radically reshaped the monarchy.<ref name=\"RS\"/> In terms of the ceremony itself, the extension of the franchise meant that some 500 [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|members of Parliament]] would be invited to attend, in addition to the peerage.<ref>{{harvnb|Worsley|2018|pages=94\u201395}}.</ref> A greater consideration was the need to somehow involve the general public, and Melbourne championed the centuries-old custom of a public procession taking place through the streets of London.<ref name=\"RS\"/> There had been a procession in 1831, but a much longer route was planned for 1838, that included a new startpoint at Buckingham Palace. Earlier processions had run from the [[Tower of London]] to the Abbey. Victoria's procession would be the longest since that of [[Charles II of the United Kingdom|Charles II]] in April 1661.<ref name=\"LW95\">{{harvnb|Worsley|2018|p=95}}.</ref> Scaffolding for spectators would be built all along the route.<ref name=\"RS\"/> According to contemporary reports, this was achieved, with one report stating that there was scarcely \"...a vacant spot along the whole [route]... ...that was unoccupied with galleries or scaffolding\".<ref>{{harvnb|Worsley|2018|page=96}}.</ref> The diarist [[Charles Greville (diarist)|Charles Greville]] commented that the principal object of the government plan was to amuse and interest the ordinary working people.<ref name=\"RS\"/> He later concluded that the \"great merit\" of the coronation was that so much had been done for the people.<ref name=\"LW95\"/>\n\nIn terms of the cost, the government was torn between the extremes of [[Coronation of George IV|George IV's lavish coronation]] in 1821 and the \"cut-price\" event, dubbed the \"Half-Crown-ation\", that had been held for William IV in 1831. It decided to allow a budget of \u00a370,000,<ref name=\"LW94\"/> which represented a compromise between two extremes of \u00a3240,000 (1821) and \u00a330,000 (1831).<ref name=\"RS\"/>\n\n==Objections==\nThe government's plans for the coronation attracted considerable criticism from its opponents. For different reasons, both the Tories and the Radicals objected to the coronation being turned into a day of popular celebration, to be seen by as wide a public as possible. The Tory objections, mostly made beforehand, were that the government's plans to put much of the spending into the long public procession detracted from the traditional dignity of the ceremonies at Westminster, which would be \"shorn of majesty by Benthamite [[utilitarianism]]\".<ref name=\"Plunkett 2003 22\">{{harvnb|Plunkett|2003|p=22}}.</ref> The Radical left, including the [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement which was largely anti-monarchist, thought the whole occasion far too expensive.<ref name=\"JP26\">{{harvnb|Plunkett|2003|pages=26\u201327}}.</ref>\n\nA dubious perception that prevailed was the identification of the new monarch with the Whig party. This would be a problem through the early years of Victoria's reign, leading to the so-called [[Bedchamber Crisis]] in 1839 over what were at the time considered to be the political nature of the appointments of her [[ladies-in-waiting]]. In addition, the Whig party exploited Victoria's name in its election campaign, suggesting that a monarch from a new generation would inevitably mean the progress of reform. William IV and his wife [[Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen]] had strong Tory sympathies, whilst Victoria's [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|mother and namesake]] was known to favour the Whigs.

The ceremony was held in [[Westminster Abbey]] after a public procession through the streets from [[Buckingham Palace]], to which the Queen returned later as part of a second procession.\n\nPlanning for the coronation, led by the prime minister, [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]], began at [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] level in March 1838. In the face of various objections from numerous parties, the Cabinet announced on Saturday, 7 April, that the coronation would be at the end of the [[Legislative session|parliamentary session]] in June. It was budgeted at \u00a370,000, which was more than double the cost of the \"cut-price\" 1831 coronation, but considerably less than the \u00a3240,000 spent when [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] was crowned in July 1821. A key element of the plan was presentation of the event to a wider public.\n\nBy 1838, the [[History of rail transport in Great Britain 1830\u20131922|newly built railways]] were able to deliver huge numbers of people into London and it has been estimated that some 400,000 visitors arrived to swell the crowds who thronged the streets while the two processions took place and filled the parks where catering and entertainment were provided. [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] was the scene of a huge fair, including a [[Balloon (aeronautics)|balloon ascent]]. The fair was scheduled to take place over two days, but was in the end extended by popular demand to four days. [[Green Park]] featured a [[Fireworks|firework display]] the night after the ceremony. The coronation coincided with a period of fine weather and the whole event was generally considered a great success by both the press and the wider public, although those inside the Abbey witnessed a good deal of mishap and confusion, largely due to lack of rehearsal time. In the country at large, there was considerable opposition to the coronation by [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicals]], especially in [[Northern England|the North of England]].\n\n==Background and planning==\nQueen Victoria succeeded her uncle [[King William IV]] on 20 June 1837.<ref>{{harvnb|Worsley|2018|p=81}}.</ref> Her first [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]] was [[Lord Melbourne]], with whom she developed a close personal friendship.<ref>{{harvnb|Worsley|2018|pages=86\u201387}}.</ref> Until 1867, the [[Demise of the Crown]] automatically triggered the [[dissolution of parliament]]: voting in the subsequent [[1837 United Kingdom general election|general election]] took place between 24 July and 18 August. The result was a victory for Melbourne, whose [[British Whig Party|Whig Party]] government was returned to power for another four years. Their majority over the opposition [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative (formerly Tory) Party]] was reduced from 112 seats to 30. Melbourne was the leading player in the planning, preparation and implementation of Victoria's coronation.<ref name=\"RS\">{{cite web |url=http://www.queenvictoriasjournals.org/info/QueenVictoriasCoronation.do |title=Queen Victoria's Coronation |author1-link=Roy Strong |author1-last=Strong |author1-first=Roy |website=Queen Victoria's Journals |publisher=Royal Archives |accessdate=8 April 2019}}{{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nMelbourne's Cabinet began formal discussions of the subject of the coronation during March 1838.<ref name=\"LW94\">{{harvnb|Worsley|2018|p=94}}.</ref> A major factor in the planning was that the coronation was the first to be held since the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Act of 1832]], when the government radically reshaped the monarchy.<ref name=\"RS\"/> In terms of the ceremony itself, the extension of the franchise meant that some 500 [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|members of Parliament]] would be invited to attend, in addition to the peerage.<ref>{{harvnb|Worsley|2018|pages=94\u201395}}.</ref> A greater consideration was the need to somehow involve the general public, and Melbourne championed the centuries-old custom of a public procession taking place through the streets of London.<ref name=\"RS\"/> There had been a procession in 1831, but a much longer route was planned for 1838, that included a new startpoint at Buckingham Palace. Earlier processions had run from the [[Tower of London]] to the Abbey. Victoria's procession would be the longest since that of [[Charles II of the United Kingdom|Charles II]] in April 1661.<ref name=\"LW95\">{{harvnb|Worsley|2018|p=95}}.</ref> Scaffolding for spectators would be built all along the route.<ref name=\"RS\"/> According to contemporary reports, this was achieved, with one report stating that there was scarcely \"...a vacant spot along the whole [route]... ...that was unoccupied with galleries or scaffolding\".<ref>{{harvnb|Worsley|2018|page=96}}.</ref> The diarist [[Charles Greville (diarist)|Charles Greville]] commented that the principal object of the government plan was to amuse and interest the ordinary working people.<ref name=\"RS\"/> He later concluded that the \"great merit\" of the coronation was that so much had been done for the people.<ref name=\"LW95\"/>\n\nIn terms of the cost, the government was torn between the extremes of [[Coronation of George IV|George IV's lavish coronation]] in 1821 and the \"cut-price\" event, dubbed the \"Half-Crown-ation\", that had been held for William IV in 1831. It decided to allow a budget of \u00a370,000,<ref name=\"LW94\"/> which represented a compromise between two extremes of \u00a3240,000 (1821) and \u00a330,000 (1831).<ref name=\"RS\"/>\n\n==Objections==\nThe government's plans for the coronation attracted considerable criticism from its opponents. For different reasons, both the Tories and the Radicals objected to the coronation being turned into a day of popular celebration, to be seen by as wide a public as possible. The Tory objections, mostly made beforehand, were that the government's plans to put much of the spending into the long public procession detracted from the traditional dignity of the ceremonies at Westminster, which would be \"shorn of majesty by Benthamite [[utilitarianism]]\".<ref name=\"Plunkett 2003 22\">{{harvnb|Plunkett|2003|p=22}}.</ref> The Radical left, including the [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement which was largely anti-monarchist, thought the whole occasion far too expensive.<ref name=\"JP26\">{{harvnb|Plunkett|2003|pages=26\u201327}}.</ref>\n\nA dubious perception that prevailed was the identification of the new monarch with the Whig party. This would be a problem through the early years of Victoria's reign, leading to the so-called [[Bedchamber Crisis]] in 1839 over what were at the time considered to be the political nature of the appointments of her [[ladies-in-waiting]]. In addition, the Whig party exploited Victoria's name in its election campaign, suggesting that a monarch from a new generation would inevitably mean the progress of reform. William IV and his wife [[Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen]] had strong Tory sympathies, whilst Victoria's [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|mother and namesake]] was known to favour the Whigs. It was assumed\u2014to some extent correctly\u2014that Victoria herself had been brought up to hold similar views. This was reflected in [[Broadside (music)|popular ballads]] sold on the streets, one of which had Victoria saying:<ref>{{harvnb|Plunkett|2003|pages=18\u201321}} (ballad, p. 21).</ref>\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">I'll make some alterations,\nI'll gain the people's right,\nI will have a radical Parliament\nOr they don't lodge here tonight.</poem>\n\nThe government's decision to dispense with certain traditions, including the exclusive banquet at [[Palace of Westminster#Westminster Hall|Westminster Hall]] and medieval rituals such as having a monarchical champion throwing down a gauntlet, was seen by the Tory aristocracy as a snub.<ref name=\"RS\"/> In the [[House of Lords]], complaints were made about the procession of a young girl in public (Victoria was nineteen), that would cause her to be \"exposed to the gaze of the populace\".<ref name=\"RS\"/> On a commercial footing, an association of London traders objected to the planned date, stating that they needed more time to order their merchandise. They favoured a date in August.<ref name=\"LW94\"/>\n\nThere were generic objections to the coronation, which were based on an [[Republicanism in the United Kingdom|underlying opposition to the monarchy]] as an institution.<ref name=\"LW104\">{{harvnb|Worsley|2018|p=104}}.</ref> The historian [[Lucy Worsley]] believes that had it not been for Victoria's popularity as a young woman, in contrast with her uncles, especially the despised George IV, the monarchy would have been \"an institution in danger\".<ref name=\"LW104\"/> There was a view that, within an age of reform, the coronation would be a medieval anachronism.<ref name=\"LW104\"/>\n\nThe Tory campaign of protest included several public meetings, and an open letter from the [[Robert Stewart, 1st Marquess of Londonderry|Marquess of Londonderry]] to the [[Lord Mayor of London]] and the aldermen and tradesmen, published in ''[[The Times]]'' on Saturday, 2 June. The campaign culminated with Londonderry's speech in the House of Lords on a motion, when he asked the Queen to postpone the coronation until 1 August so that it could be carried out with \"proper splendour\".<ref>{{harvnb|Plunkett|2003|p=24}}.</ref>\n\nThe Radical left, whose press complained of the expense during the run-up to the day, concentrated on trying to dampen public enthusiasm. They had some success in the north of England. In [[Manchester]], a campaign organised by trade unions and other groups reduced the attendance at the local procession organised by the city council to a third of the turnout of that for the previous coronation.<ref name=\"RS\"/><ref name=\"JP25\">{{harvnb|Plunkett|2003|pages=25\u201330}}.</ref> In several manufacturing towns of northern England, the Chartists co-ordinated anti-monarchist demonstrations.<ref name=\"JP26\"/>\n\n==Public procession and crowds==\n[[File:The Procession Approaching Westminster Abbey.jpg|thumb|An illustration from the children's book ''Peter Parley's Visit to London, During the Coronation of Queen Victoria'' (1839)]]\nPrior to 1838, only the peerage had been taken part in a coronation. The day's ceremonies would have begun in Westminster Hall, (now attached to the [[Houses of Parliament]]), and upon their completion, peers would have walked together across the road to Westminster Abbey, where they witnessed the monarch being crowned.<ref name=\"Plunkett 2003 22\"/> In accordance with Melbourne's new plan, however, the traditional ceremonies in Westminster Hall and the procession to the Abbey were replaced with two much longer processions through London. Victoria travelled inside the [[Gold State Coach]] (also known as the Coronation Coach), made for [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] in 1762, as part of a procession which included many other coaches, and a cavalry escort.<ref name=\"RS\"/><ref name=\"HR361\">{{harvnb|Rappaport|2003|p=361}}.</ref> According to ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'' it was the longest coronation procession since that of Charles II in 1660.<ref name=\"RS\"/><ref name=\"HR361\"/><ref name=\"JP22\">{{harvnb|Plunkett|2003|pages=22\u201324}}.</ref> A large proportion of the budget was used to pay for the procession and so there was no coronation banquet.<ref name=\"RS\"/>\n\nThe route was designed to allow as many spectators as possible to view the procession. It followed a roughly circular route from the newly-completed Buckingham Palace, past [[Hyde Park Corner]] and along [[Piccadilly]], [[St James's Street]], [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]], [[Charing Cross]] and [[Whitehall]], to Westminster Abbey: the journey took a whole hour.<ref name=\"LW97\">{{harvnb|Worsley|2018|p=97}}.</ref> The processions to and from Westminster Abbey were watched by unprecedentedly large crowds, many of the people having travelled on the [[History of rail transport in Great Britain 1830\u20131922|new railways]] to London from around the country: it was estimated that 400,000 people had arrived in the capital in the days running up to the event.<ref name=\"RS\"/><ref name=\"HR361\"/>\n\nWilliam IV's coronation established much of the [[Medieval pageant|pageantry]] of [[Coronation of the British monarch|subsequent coronations]].<ref name=\"RS\"/> The procession by coach to and from the Abbey, which first occurred in 1838, has been repeated in all subsequent coronations.<ref name=\"RS\"/>\n\n==Ceremony in Westminster Abbey==\n===A \"botched\" coronation===\n[[File:Gold State Coach 1-20070917.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Gold State Coach]], drawn by eight horses, in the [[Royal Mews]]]]\nAccording to the historian [[Roy Strong]], \"the ceremony of 1838 was the last of the botched coronations\".

They rediscovered the rites that had taken place during medieval coronations, and which were then used for the coronation of [[Edward VII]] in 1902.<ref name=\"RS\"/> The picturesque ritual of the [[Queen's Champion]] riding through [[Westminster Hall]] in full armour and issuing his challenge was omitted, and has never been revived; the Champion, [[Henry Dymoke]], was made a [[baronet]] instead.<ref name=\"JP22\"/>\n\nThere was very little rehearsal, with the result that on the day the ceremonial was marred by mistakes and accidents.<ref>{{cite book |author1-last=Gosling |author1-first=Lucinda |year=2013 |title=Royal Coronations |location=Oxford |publisher=Shire |isbn=978-0-74781-220-3 |page=52}}</ref> The Queen, who was persuaded by [[Lord Melbourne]] to visit the Abbey the evening before, afterwards insisted that as a result she then knew where to move to during the coronation service.<ref name=\"RS\"/> Roy Strong doubts whether she did know, and quotes Greville's comment that \"the different actors in the ceremonial were very imperfect in their parts and had neglected to rehearse them\".<ref name=\"RS\"/> In the words of [[Benjamin Disraeli]], then a young MP, those involved \"were always in doubt as to what came next, and you saw the want of rehearsal\".<ref name=\"RS\"/><ref name=\"LW102\">{{harvnb|Worsley|2018|p=102}}.</ref>\n\nThe whole service lasted five hours, and involved two changes of dress for the Queen. At points in the service when they were not needed to be present at the Coronation Theatre (composed of the pavement fronting the main altar and the [[crossing (architecture)|crossing]]), the royal party were able to retreat to \"St. Edward's Chapel, as it is called; but which as Ld Melbourne said, was more unlike a Chapel, than anything he had ever seen, for what was called an altar, was covered with plates of sandwiches, bottles of wine, &c\".<ref name=\"RS\"/><ref name=\"HR361\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.queenvictoriasjournals.org/search/displayItemFromId.do?FormatType=fulltextimgsrc&QueryType=articles&ItemID=18380628&volumeType=PSBEA |website=Queen Victoria's Journals |title=Princess Beatrice's copies |page=81 |publisher=Royal Archives |date=28 June 1838 |accessdate=24 May 2013}}{{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nThe [[social theory]] writer [[Harriet Martineau]], who had been invited to the coronation by the Queen herself, recorded a sceptical view of the day.<ref name=\"RS\"/><ref name=\"JP25\"/> Martineau recorded some favourable comments, but on the whole thought that the ceremony was \"highly barbaric\", \"worthy only of the old Pharaonic times in Egypt\", and \"offensive ... to the God of the nineteenth century in the Western world\".<ref name=\"RS\"/>\n\n===Lord Rolle's accident===\n[[File:Coronation of Queen Victoria - John Martin.jpg|thumb|right|''Coronation of Queen Victoria'', by [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]], depicting the Queen advancing to the edge of the platform to meet Lord Rolle (1839)]]\nAn accident occurred  that the Queen was able to turn to her advantage, and which she later described in [[Queen Victoria's journals|her journal]]:\n\n{{Quote|\"Poor old Ld Rolls [[John Rolle, 1st Baron Rolle|[actually Lord Rolle]]], who is 82, & dreadfully infirm, fell, in attempting to ascend the steps, \u2013 rolled right down, but was not the least hurt.

It was first noted as a developing tropical low within a trough of low pressure during April 1, while it was located to the east of [[Papua New Guinea]]. Over the next day, the system moved south-eastwards over the [[Solomon Sea]], before it was classified as a tropical cyclone and named Harold by the Australian [[Bureau of Meteorology]]. The system moved into the [[Fiji Meteorological Service|Fiji Meteorological Service's]] area of responsibility on April&nbsp;2 and began to explosively intensify by April&nbsp;3, reaching Category 4 status by April&nbsp;4 on both scales. The next day, it further strengthened into a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone, the highest rating on the Australian scale. It made landfall on [[Espiritu Santo]] on April&nbsp;6. Shortly afterward, the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) upgraded it to a Category 5-equivalent cyclone on the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]].

It was first noted as a developing tropical low within a trough of low pressure during April 1, while it was located to the east of [[Papua New Guinea]]. Over the next day, the system moved south-eastwards over the [[Solomon Sea]], before it was classified as a tropical cyclone and named Harold by the Australian [[Bureau of Meteorology]]. The system moved into the [[Fiji Meteorological Service|Fiji Meteorological Service\u2019s]] area of responsibility on April&nbsp;2 and began to explosively intensify by April&nbsp;3, reaching Category 4 status by April&nbsp;4 on both scales. The next day, it further strengthened into a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone, the highest rating on the Australian scale. It made landfall on [[Espiritu Santo]] on April&nbsp;6. Shortly afterward, the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) upgraded it to a Category 5-equivalent cyclone on the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]]. It maintained this status for only six hours before being downgraded back to Category 4.\n\nHarold was the first Category 5 severe tropical cyclone to occur in the South Pacific basin since [[Cyclone Gita]] in 2018 and was also the second-strongest tropical cyclone to ever affect [[Vanuatu]], behind [[Cyclone Pam]] in 2015.<ref>{{cite news |title=Vanuatu Reeling from Category 5 Harold, Now
