The town was the seat of the [[Grafschaft Hals|Lord of Hals]], which was his earldom in 1280. In 1376 the Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] granted the a [[town privileges|charter]] to the town and also provided it with coining rights (M\u00fcnzrecht) until 1497.\n\nIn the background of the later decline of the earldom, municipal rights began to be exercised more strongly. In 1517 the earldom passed to Bavaria and the town was the sea of a [[Pfleger]] (caregiver). In 1587 Duke [[William V, Duke of Bavaria|William V]] reinstated the town's status as a market. Due to its cramped conditions the market town could not expand, on the other hand, the [[Bishop of Passau|Bishops of Passau]] never succeeded in integrated the town into the prince bishop's territories.\n\n===19th Century===\nIn 1803 the area was part of the royal district court of Passau. 1810 the town was devastated, as it was many times before, by a fire. Most of the remaining houses in the town, including the parish, were built shortly after the fire. In 1825, Hals received the status of a III Class [[Town privileges|town]].\n\nSince the Middle Ages [[timber rafting]] was an important economic factor for Hals. The powerful levees (Tiftsperre) were developed and the existing 115 m long tunnel was construction from 1827 to 1831. In Hals, the storage yards were expanded and the timer industry began to grow, with the corporation Salomon Forcheimer employing hundreds of seasoner workers. However, this site had to be abandoned in 1926 due to a missing rail link.\n\nIn 1890, the Passauer photographer Ducrue built a Bavaria-Bad cure and hydrotherapy spa in Siegelberg. Hals was then temporarily named \"Bad Hals\" Under the new owner, Dr. Mayerhaused the bathhouse was further expanded. It utilized every kind of [[Hydrotherapy]] as well as [[Electrotherapy]]. During World War I, its therapeutic centers were taken apart.\n\n===Twentieth century===\nIn 1902, Hals renounced its town privileges and returned to its previous status as a market.

She lives in an apartment above the amusement park that houses the merry-go-round.

She remains below and swims away.\n\nJohnny is devastated, but returns to the boardwalk the following evening and goes to the sideshow, where he finds Captain Murdock at the entrance as usual.

The gunshots attract the attention of two policemen on the boardwalk, and Murdock and Johnny are taken into custody.\n\nAt the police station, Murdock confesses, saying he found and adopted Mora when she was a young orphan on a Greek island. He planted the idea that she was a mermaid, incapable of living the life of a normal woman, as a way of binding her to him forever. When she matured and began to attract the attention of young men, Murdock murdered them and let Mora think that she had caused their deaths. However, Captain Murdock denies any knowledge of the strange figure Mora believed to be a Siren.\n\nAs Johnny's shore leave ends, the merry-go-round operator's daughter, who has taken an interest in him, visits the police station to bid him goodbye.
