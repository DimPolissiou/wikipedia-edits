The one-year Interest Bearing Notes featured a [[Vignette (graphic design)|vignette]] of [[George Washington]] in the center, and [[allegorical]] figures representing \"The Guardian\" to the right and \"Justice\" to the left. The two-year notes featured a vignette of the [[U.S. Treasury#History|U.S. treasury building]] in the center, a farmer and mechanic to the left, and sailors firing a cannon to the right.\n* 1863: The first $100 [[Gold Certificate]]s were issued with a [[bald eagle]] to the left and large green 100 in the middle of the obverse. The reverse was distinctly printed in orange instead of green like all other U.S. federal government issued notes of the time.\n* 1864: [[Compound Interest Treasury Note]]s were issued that were intended to circulate for three years and paid 6% interest compounded semi-annually. The obverse is similar to the 1863 one-year Interest Bearing Note.\n* 1869: A new $100 [[United States Note]] was issued with a portrait of [[Abraham Lincoln]] on the left of the obverse and an allegorical figure representing architecture on the right. Although this note is technically a United States Note, {{sc|TREASURY NOTE}} appeared on it instead of {{sc|UNITED STATES NOTE}}.\n* 1870: A new $100 Gold Certificate with a portrait of [[Thomas Hart Benton (senator)|Thomas Hart Benton]] on the left side of the obverse was issued. The note was one-sided.\n* 1870: One hundred dollar [[National Gold Bank Note]]s were issued specifically for payment in gold coin by participating national gold banks. The obverse featured vignettes of Perry leaving the [[USS St. Lawrence (1848)|USS St. Lawrence]] and an allegorical figure to the right; the reverse featured a vignette of U.S. gold coins.\n* 1875: The reverse of the ''Series of 1869'' United States Note was redesigned. Also, {{sc|TREASURY NOTE}} was changed to {{sc|UNITED STATES NOTE}} on the obverse. This note was issued again in ''Series of 1878'' and ''Series of 1880''.\n* 1878: The first $100 [[Silver certificate (United States)|silver certificate]] was issued with a portrait of [[James Monroe]] on the left side of the obverse. The reverse was printed in '''black''' ink, unlike any other U.S. Federal Government issued bill.\n* 1882: A new and revised $100 Gold Certificate was issued. The obverse was partially the same as the ''Series 1870'' gold certificate; the border design, portrait of Thomas H. Benton, and large word {{sc|GOLD}}, and gold-colored ink behind the serial numbers were all retained. The reverse featured a perched bald eagle and the [[Roman numeral]] for 100, C.\n* 1890: One hundred dollar Treasury or \"Coin Notes\" were issued for government purchases of silver bullion from the silver mining industry. The note featured a portrait of Admiral [[David G. Farragut]]. The note was also nicknamed a \"watermelon note\" because of the watermelon-shaped 0's in the large numeral 100 on the reverse; the large numeral 100 was surrounded by an ornate design that occupied almost the entire note.\n* 1891: The reverse of the ''Series of 1890'' Treasury Note was redesigned because the Treasury felt that it was too \"busy\" which would make it too easy to counterfeit. More open space was incorporated into the new design.\n* 1891: The obverse of the $100 Silver Certificate was slightly revised with some aspects of the design changed. The reverse was completely redesigned and also began to be printed in green ink.\n* 1914: The first $100 [[Federal Reserve Note]] was issued with a portrait of Benjamin Franklin on the obverse and allegorical figures representing labor, plenty, America, peace, and commerce on the reverse.\n* 1922: The ''Series of 1880'' Gold Certificate was re-issued with an obligation to the right of the bottom-left serial number on the obverse.\n\n===Small size notes===\n''(6.14 \u00d7 2.61 in \u2245 157 \u00d7 66&nbsp;mm)''\n[[File:US-$100-GC-1934-Fr.2406.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Both views (obverse and reverse) of the ''Series 1934'' $100 Gold Certificate.]]\n[[File:US $100 United States Note 1966.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Front of a ''Series 1966'' $100 United States note.]]\n[[File:Usdollar100front.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Obverse of a ''Series 2006A'' $100 note.]]\n[[File:Benjamin Franklin.PNG|thumb|right|200px|[[Joseph-Siffred Duplessis]] portrait of Benjamin Franklin used on the $100 bill from 1929 until 1996.]]\n[[File:Franklin-Benjamin-LOC.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Henry Bryan Hall|H.B.Hall]] engraving of [[Joseph-Siffred Duplessis]] portrait of an older Benjamin Franklin used on the $100 bill 1996 onward.]]\n[[File:US100DollarBills-Old&2013.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Comparison between a Series 1990 note with a 2013 note.]]\n* 1929: Under the [[Series of 1928 (United States Currency)|''Series of 1928'']], all U.S. currency was changed to its [[Small-sized note|current size]] and began to carry a standardized design. All variations of the $100 bill would carry the same portrait of Benjamin Franklin, same border design on the [[obverse]], and the same [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] with a vignette of Independence Hall. The $100 bill was issued as a [[Federal Reserve Note]] with a green seal and serial numbers and as a [[Gold Certificate]] with a golden seal and serial numbers.\n* 1933: As an emergency response to the [[Great Depression]], additional money was pumped into the American economy through Federal Reserve Bank Notes issued under ''Series of 1929''. This was the only small-sized $100 bill that had a slightly different border design on the obverse. The serial numbers and seal on it were brown.\n* 1934: The ''redeemable in gold'' clause was removed from Federal Reserve Notes due to the U.S. withdrawing from the [[gold standard]].\n* 1934: Special $100 Gold Certificates were issued for non-public, Federal Reserve bank-to-bank transactions. These notes featured a reverse printed in orange instead of green like all other small-sized notes. The wording on the obverse was also changed to {{sc|ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN GOLD PAYABLE TO THE BEARER ON DEMAND AS AUTHORIZED BY LAW}}.\n* 1950: Many minor aspects on the obverse of the $100 Federal Reserve Note were changed. Most noticeably, the treasury seal, gray numeral '100', and the Federal Reserve Seal were now smaller with small \"spikes\" added around the Federal Reserve seal, like the Treasury seal.\n* 1963: Because dollar bills were no longer redeemable in silver, beginning with ''Series 1963A'', {{sc|WILL PAY TO THE BEARER ON DEMAND}} was removed from the obverse of the $100 Federal Reserve Note and the obligation was shortened to its current wording, {{sc|THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER FOR ALL DEBTS, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE}}. Also, [[United States national motto|{{sc|IN GOD WE TRUST}}]] was added to the reverse.\n* 1966: The first and only small-sized $100 [[United States Note]] was issued with a red seal and serial numbers. It was the first of all United States currency to use the new U.S. [[Seal of the United States Department of the Treasury|treasury seal]] with wording in [[English language|English]] instead of [[Latin]]. Like the ''Series 1963'' $2 and $5 United States Notes, it lacked {{sc|WILL PAY TO THE BEARER ON DEMAND}} on the obverse and featured the motto {{sc|IN GOD WE TRUST}} on the reverse. The $100 United States Note was issued due to legislation that specified a certain dollar amount of United States Notes that were to remain in circulation. Because the $2 and $5 United States Notes were soon to be discontinued, the dollar amount of United States Notes would drop, thus warranting the issuing of this note. $100 United States Notes were last printed in 1969 and last issued in 1971.\n* 1990: The first new-age anti-counterfeiting measures were introduced under ''Series 1990'' with microscopic printing around Franklin's portrait and a metallic security strip on the left side of the bill.\n* March 25, 1996: The first major design change of the $100 note since 1929 took place with the adoption of a contemporary style layout. The main intent of the new design was to deter [[counterfeit]]ing. New security features included a [[watermark]] of Franklin to the right side of the bill, [[optically variable ink]] (OVI) that changed from green to black when viewed at different angles on the lower right corner '100', a higher quality and enlarged portrait of Franklin, and hard-to-reproduce fine line printing around Franklin's portrait and Independence Hall. Older security features such as interwoven red and blue silk fibers, microprinting, and a plastic security thread (which now glows pink [nominally red] under a [[black light]]) were kept. The individual Federal Reserve Bank Seal was changed to a unified Federal Reserve Seal along with an additional prefix letter being added to the serial number, w. The first of the Series 1996 bills were produced in October 1995.<ref>[http://www.uspapermoney.info/serials/f1996_h.html USPaperMoney.Info: Series 1996 $100] July 1999</ref>\n* February 2007: The first $100 bills (a shipment of 128,000 [[Replacement note|star notes]] from the [[Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco|San Francisco FRB]]) from the Western Currency Facility in [[Fort Worth, Texas]] are produced, almost 16 years after the first notes from the facility were produced.

The reverse features a large gradient '100' printed vertically on the right side, small yellow EURion 100s and has the fine lines removed from around the vignette of Independence Hall. These notes were issued as ''Series 2009A'' with [[Rosa Gumataotao Rios|''Rios'']]''-''[[Timothy Geithner|''Geithner'']] signatures.

The one-hundred-dollar bill was the largest denomination left in circulation.

The total amount of circulating currency and coin passed one trillion dollars in March 2011.\n\nDespite the degradation in the value of the U.S. $100 banknote (which was worth about ${{Inflation|US|100|1969|r=2}} in 1969), and despite competition from some more valuable foreign notes (most notably, the [[500 euro note|500 euro banknote]]), there are no plans to re-issue banknotes above $100. The widespread use of electronic means to conduct high-value transactions today has made large-scale physical cash transactions obsolete and therefore, from the government's point of view, unnecessary for the conduct of legitimate business.

Allison, Assistant to the Board of the [[Federal Reserve System]] in his October 8, 1998 testimony before the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]], [[United States House Financial Services Subcommittee on Domestic and International Monetary Policy, Trade, and Technology|Subcommittee on Domestic and International Monetary Policy]], [[United States House Committee on Financial Services|Committee on Banking and Financial Services]]:\n\n{{quote|There are public policies against reissuing the $500 note, mainly because many of those efficiency gains, such as lower shipment and storage costs, would accrue not only to legitimate users of bank notes but also to money launderers, tax evaders and a variety of other lawbreakers who use currency in their criminal activity. While it is not at all clear that the volume of illegal drugs sold or the amount of tax evasion would necessarily increase just as a consequence of the availability of a larger dollar denomination bill, it no doubt is the case that if wrongdoers were provided with an easier mechanism to launder their funds and hide their profits, enforcement authorities could have a harder time detecting certain illicit transactions occurring in cash.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://commdocs.house.gov/committees/bank/hba51647.000/hba51647_0f.htm |title=Will Jumbo Euro Notes Threaten the Greenback? |publisher=[[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] |date=October 8, 1998 |accessdate=2012-04-06}}</ref>}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book\n| last      = Friedberg\n| first     = Arthur\n|author2=Ira Friedberg |author3=David Bowers\n | title     = A Guide Book of United States Paper Money: Complete Source for History, Grading, and Prices (Official Red Book)\n| publisher = Whitman Publishing\n| year      = 2005\n| isbn      = 0-7948-1786-6 }}\n*{{cite book |last       = Hudgeons\n |first      = Thomas\n |title      = The Official Blackbook Price Guide to U.S. Paper Money 2006\n |edition    = 38th\n |publisher  = House of Collectibles\n |year       = 2005\n |isbn       = 1-4000-4845-1\n |oclc       = 244167611\n |url-access = registration\n |url        = https://archive.org/details/officialblackboo00thom_2\n}}\n*{{cite book |last       = Wilhite\n |first      = Robert\n |title      = Standard Catalog of United States Paper Money\n |edition    = 17th\n |publisher  = Krause Publications\n |year       = 1998\n |isbn       = 0-87341-653-8\n |url-access = registration\n |url        = https://archive.org/details/standardcatalogo0000krau\n}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Money|Numismatics|United States}}\n{{commons category|100 United States dollar banknotes}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110904005545/http://www.newmoney.gov/newmoney/flash/interactive100/index.html Interactive Note - English]\n*[https://www.landmarkcash.com/100-dollar-bill.html Evolution of the $100 Dollar Bill - Landmark Cash]\n\n{{US currency and coinage}}\n{{Benjamin Franklin}}\n\n[[Category:Currencies introduced in 1861]]\n[[Category:Works about Benjamin Franklin]]\n[[Category:One-hundred-base-unit banknotes]]\n[[Category:Banknotes of the United States|*100]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Highest-value denomination of the U.S currency in circulation}}\n{{Infobox banknote\n| denomination        = One hundred [[United States dollar|dollars]]\n| country             = United States\n| value               = $100\n| actual_value        = in 1864 dollars (the year the bill was introduced) $6.54 based on the CPI, $0.38 based on production worker compensation\n| unit                =\n| width_mm            = 156\n| height_mm           = 66.3\n| thickness_mm        = 0.109\n| weight_g            = c. 1.0<ref>{{cite web|author1=U.S. Currency Education Program|title=Weight of a US Banknote|url=https://www.uscurrency.gov/content/weight-banknote|website=uscurrency.gov|publisher=US Federal Reserve|accessdate=19 January 2018}}</ref>\n| security_features   = Security fibers, [[watermark]], [[Crane Currency#Motion|3D security ribbon]], [[security thread]], [[color shifting ink]], [[microprinting]], raised printing, [[EURion constellation]]\n| paper_type          = 75% cotton<br/>25% linen\n| years_of_printing   = 1861\u2013present\n| obverse             = New100front.jpg\n| obverse_design      = [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], [[quill pen]], [[inkwell]]\n| obverse_designer    =\n| obverse_design_date = 2009\n| reverse             = New100back.jpg\n| reverse_design      = [[Independence Hall]] \n| reverse_designer    =\n| reverse_design_date = 2009\n}}\nThe '''United States one-hundred-dollar bill''' ($100) is a [[Denomination (currency)|denomination]] of [[United States dollar|United States currency]].

The one-year Interest Bearing Notes featured a [[Vignette (graphic design)|vignette]] of [[George Washington]] in the center, and [[allegorical]] figures representing \"The Guardian\" to the right and \"Justice\" to the left. The two-year notes featured a vignette of the [[U.S. Treasury#History|U.S. treasury building]] in the center, a farmer and mechanic to the left, and sailors firing a cannon to the right.\n* 1863: The first $100 [[Gold Certificate]]s were issued with a [[bald eagle]] to the left and large green 100 in the middle of the obverse. The reverse was distinctly printed in orange instead of green like all other U.S. federal government issued notes of the time.\n* 1864: [[Compound Interest Treasury Note]]s were issued that were intended to circulate for three years and paid 6% interest compounded semi-annually. The obverse is similar to the 1863 one-year Interest Bearing Note.\n* 1869: A new $100 [[United States Note]] was issued with a portrait of [[Abraham Lincoln]] on the left of the obverse and an allegorical figure representing architecture on the right. Although this note is technically a United States Note, {{sc|TREASURY NOTE}} appeared on it instead of {{sc|UNITED STATES NOTE}}.\n* 1870: A new $100 Gold Certificate with a portrait of [[Thomas Hart Benton (senator)|Thomas Hart Benton]] on the left side of the obverse was issued. The note was one-sided.\n* 1870: One hundred dollar [[National Gold Bank Note]]s were issued specifically for payment in gold coin by participating national gold banks. The obverse featured vignettes of Perry leaving the [[USS St. Lawrence (1848)|USS St. Lawrence]] and an allegorical figure to the right; the reverse featured a vignette of U.S. gold coins.\n* 1875: The reverse of the ''Series of 1869'' United States Note was redesigned. Also, {{sc|TREASURY NOTE}} was changed to {{sc|UNITED STATES NOTE}} on the obverse. This note was issued again in ''Series of 1878'' and ''Series of 1880''.\n* 1878: The first $100 [[Silver certificate (United States)|silver certificate]] was issued with a portrait of [[James Monroe]] on the left side of the obverse. The reverse was printed in '''black''' ink, unlike any other U.S. Federal Government issued bill.\n* 1882: A new and revised $100 Gold Certificate was issued. The obverse was partially the same as the ''Series 1870'' gold certificate; the border design, portrait of Thomas H. Benton, and large word {{sc|GOLD}}, and gold-colored ink behind the serial numbers were all retained. The reverse featured a perched bald eagle and the [[Roman numeral]] for 100, C.\n* 1890: One hundred dollar Treasury or \"Coin Notes\" were issued for government purchases of silver bullion from the silver mining industry. The note featured a portrait of Admiral [[David G. Farragut]]. The note was also nicknamed a \"watermelon note\" because of the watermelon-shaped 0's in the large numeral 100 on the reverse; the large numeral 100 was surrounded by an ornate design that occupied almost the entire note.\n* 1891: The reverse of the ''Series of 1890'' Treasury Note was redesigned because the Treasury felt that it was too \"busy\" which would make it too easy to counterfeit. More open space was incorporated into the new design.\n* 1891: The obverse of the $100 Silver Certificate was slightly revised with some aspects of the design changed. The reverse was completely redesigned and also began to be printed in green ink.\n* 1914: The first $100 [[Federal Reserve Note]] was issued with a portrait of Benjamin Franklin on the obverse and allegorical figures representing labor, plenty, America, peace, and commerce on the reverse.\n* 1922: The ''Series of 1880'' Gold Certificate was re-issued with an obligation to the right of the bottom-left serial number on the obverse.\n\n===Small size notes===\n''(6.14 \u00d7 2.61 in \u2245 157 \u00d7 66&nbsp;mm)''\n[[File:US-$100-GC-1934-Fr.2406.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Both views (obverse and reverse) of the ''Series 1934'' $100 Gold Certificate.]]\n[[File:US $100 United States Note 1966.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Front of a ''Series 1966'' $100 United States note.]]\n[[File:Usdollar100front.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Obverse of a ''Series 2006A'' $100 note.]]\n[[File:Benjamin Franklin.PNG|thumb|right|200px|[[Joseph-Siffred Duplessis]] portrait of Benjamin Franklin used on the $100 bill from 1929 until 1996.]]\n[[File:Franklin-Benjamin-LOC.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Henry Bryan Hall|H.B.Hall]] engraving of [[Joseph-Siffred Duplessis]] portrait of an older Benjamin Franklin used on the $100 bill 1996 onward.]]\n[[File:US100DollarBills-Old&2013.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Comparison between a Series 1990 note with a 2013 note.]]\n* 1929: Under the [[Series of 1928 (United States Currency)|''Series of 1928'']], all U.S. currency was changed to its [[Small-sized note|current size]] and began to carry a standardized design. All variations of the $100 bill would carry the same portrait of Benjamin Franklin, same border design on the [[obverse]], and the same [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] with a vignette of Independence Hall. The $100 bill was issued as a [[Federal Reserve Note]] with a green seal and serial numbers and as a [[Gold Certificate]] with a golden seal and serial numbers.\n* 1933: As an emergency response to the [[Great Depression]], additional money was pumped into the American economy through Federal Reserve Bank Notes issued under ''Series of 1929''. This was the only small-sized $100 bill that had a slightly different border design on the obverse. The serial numbers and seal on it were brown.\n* 1934: The ''redeemable in gold'' clause was removed from Federal Reserve Notes due to the U.S. withdrawing from the [[gold standard]].\n* 1934: Special $100 Gold Certificates were issued for non-public, Federal Reserve bank-to-bank transactions. These notes featured a reverse printed in orange instead of green like all other small-sized notes. The wording on the obverse was also changed to {{sc|ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN GOLD PAYABLE TO THE BEARER ON DEMAND AS AUTHORIZED BY LAW}}.\n* 1950: Many minor aspects on the obverse of the $100 Federal Reserve Note were changed. Most noticeably, the treasury seal, gray numeral '100', and the Federal Reserve Seal were now smaller with small \"spikes\" added around the Federal Reserve seal, like the Treasury seal.\n* 1963: Because dollar bills were no longer redeemable in silver, beginning with ''Series 1963A'', {{sc|WILL PAY TO THE BEARER ON DEMAND}} was removed from the obverse of the $100 Federal Reserve Note and the obligation was shortened to its current wording, {{sc|THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER FOR ALL DEBTS, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE}}. Also, [[United States national motto|{{sc|IN GOD WE TRUST}}]] was added to the reverse.\n* 1966: The first and only small-sized $100 [[United States Note]] was issued with a red seal and serial numbers. It was the first of all United States currency to use the new U.S. [[Seal of the United States Department of the Treasury|treasury seal]] with wording in [[English language|English]] instead of [[Latin]]. Like the ''Series 1963'' $2 and $5 United States Notes, it lacked {{sc|WILL PAY TO THE BEARER ON DEMAND}} on the obverse and featured the motto {{sc|IN GOD WE TRUST}} on the reverse. The $100 United States Note was issued due to legislation that specified a certain dollar amount of United States Notes that were to remain in circulation. Because the $2 and $5 United States Notes were soon to be discontinued, the dollar amount of United States Notes would drop, thus warranting the issuing of this note. $100 United States Notes were last printed in 1969 and last issued in 1971.\n* 1990: The first new-age anti-counterfeiting measures were introduced under ''Series 1990'' with microscopic printing around Franklin's portrait and a metallic security strip on the left side of the bill.\n* March 25, 1996: The first major design change of the $100 note since 1929 took place with the adoption of a contemporary style layout. The main intent of the new design was to deter [[counterfeit]]ing. New security features included a [[watermark]] of Franklin to the right side of the bill, [[optically variable ink]] (OVI) that changed from green to black when viewed at different angles on the lower right corner '100', a higher quality and enlarged portrait of Franklin, and hard-to-reproduce fine line printing around Franklin's portrait and Independence Hall. Older security features such as interwoven red and blue silk fibers, microprinting, and a plastic security thread (which now glows pink [nominally red] under a [[black light]]) were kept. The individual Federal Reserve Bank Seal was changed to a unified Federal Reserve Seal along with an additional prefix letter being added to the serial number, w. The first of the Series 1996 bills were produced in October 1995.<ref>[http://www.uspapermoney.info/serials/f1996_h.html USPaperMoney.Info: Series 1996 $100] July 1999</ref>\n* February 2007: The first $100 bills (a shipment of 128,000 [[Replacement note|star notes]] from the [[Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco|San Francisco FRB]]) from the Western Currency Facility in [[Fort Worth, Texas]] are produced, almost 16 years after the first notes from the facility were produced.

The reverse features a large gradient '100' printed vertically on the right side, small yellow EURion 100s and has the fine lines removed from around the vignette of Independence Hall. These notes were issued as ''Series 2009A'' with [[Rosa Gumataotao Rios|''Rios'']]''-''[[Timothy Geithner|''Geithner'']] signatures.

Since 1969, the demand for U.S. currency has greatly increased. The total amount of circulating currency and coin passed one trillion dollars in March 2011.\n\nDespite the degradation in the value of the U.S. $100 banknote (which was worth about ${{Inflation|US|100|1969|r=2}} in 1969), and despite competition from some more valuable foreign notes (most notably, the [[500 euro note|500 euro banknote]]), there are no plans to re-issue banknotes above $100. The widespread use of electronic means to conduct high-value transactions today has made large-scale physical cash transactions obsolete and therefore, from the government's point of view, unnecessary for the conduct of legitimate business.

The objective of the conquests was mostly of a practical nature, as fertile land and water were scarce in the Arabian peninsula. A real Islamization therefore only came about in the subsequent centuries.<ref name=\"Hourani 1\">Hourani, pg.22-24</ref>\n\n[[Ira Lapidus]] distinguishes between two separate strands of converts of the time: one is animists and polytheists of tribal societies of the Arabian peninsula and the [[Fertile crescent]]; the other one is the native Christians and Jews who existed peacefully before the Muslim invaders arrived.<ref name=\"Lapidus 4\">Lapidus, 200-201</ref>\n\nThe empire spread from the Atlantic Ocean to the [[Aral Sea]], from the [[Atlas Mountains]] to the [[Hindu Kush]], bounded mostly \"a combination of natural barriers and well-organized states\".<ref name=RGHIGP2015:207>[[#RGHIGP2015|Hoyland, ''In God's Path'', 2015]]: p.207</ref> \n\nFor the polytheistic and pagan societies, apart from the religious and spiritual reasons each individual may have had, conversion to Islam \"represented the response of a tribal, pastoral population to the need for a larger framework for political and economic integration, a more stable state, and a more imaginative and encompassing moral vision to cope with the problems of a tumultuous society.\"<ref name=\"Lapidus 4\"/> In contrast, for tribal, nomadic, monotheistic societies, \"Islam was substituted for a Byzantine or Sassanian political identity and for a Christian, Jewish or Zoroastrian religious affiliation.\"<ref name=\"Lapidus 4\"/> Conversion initially was neither required nor necessarily wished for: \"(The Arab conquerors) did not require the conversion as much as the subordination of non-Muslim peoples. At the outset, they were hostile to conversions because new Muslims diluted the economic and status advantages of the Arabs.\"<ref name=\"Lapidus 4\"/>\n\nOnly in subsequent centuries, with the development of the religious doctrine of Islam and with that the understanding of the Muslim [[ummah]], did mass conversion take place. The new understanding by the religious and political leadership in many cases led to a weakening or breakdown of the social and religious structures of parallel religious communities such as Christians and Jews.<ref name=\"Lapidus 4\"/>\n\nThe caliphs of the Arab dynasty established the first schools inside the empire which taught Arabic language and Islamic studies. They furthermore began the ambitious project of building mosques across the empire, many of which remain today as the most magnificent Mosques in the Islamic world, such as the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus. At the end of the Umayyad period, less than 10% of the people in Iran, Iraq, Syria, Egypt, Tunisia and Spain were Muslim. Only on the Arabian peninsula was the proportion of Muslims among the population higher than this.<ref name=\"Hourani 2\">Hourani, pg.41-48</ref>\n\n===Phase II: The Abbasids (750\u20131258)===\n{{see also|Abbasid Caliphate}}\n[[File:Mustansiriya University CPT.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]]s are known to have founded some of the world's earliest educational institutions such as the [[House of Wisdom]].]]\n\nThe Abbasid era replaced the expanding empire and \"tribal politics\" of \"the tight-knit Syro-Arabian elite<ref name=RGHIGP2015:207>[[#RGHIGP2015|Hoyland, ''In God's Path'', 2015]]: p.207</ref> with cosmopolitan culture and disciplines of Islamic [[Science in the medieval Islamic world|science]],<ref name=RGHIGP2015:207>[[#RGHIGP2015|Hoyland, ''In God's Path'', 2015]]: p.207</ref> [[islamic philosophy|philosophy]], [[Islamic theology|theology]], [[Islamic Law|law]] and [[Islamic mysticism|mysticism]] became more widespread and the gradual conversions of the populations within the empire occurred. Significant conversions also occurred beyond the extents of the empire such as that of the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic tribes]] in [[Central Asia]] and peoples living in regions south of the [[Sahara]] in [[Africa]] through contact with Muslim traders active in the area and [[Tariqah|Sufi orders]]. In Africa it spread along three routes, across the Sahara via trading towns such as [[Timbuktu]], up the [[Nile Valley]] through [[the Sudan]] up to [[Uganda]] and across the [[Red Sea]] and down [[East Africa]] through settlements such as [[Mombasa]] and [[Zanzibar]]. These initial conversions were of a flexible nature.\n\nThe reasons why, by the end of the 10th century, a large part of the population had converted to Islam are diverse. According to British-Lebanese historian [[Albert Hourani]], one of the reasons may be that\n<blockquote>  \t \n\"Islam had become more clearly defined, and the line between Muslims and non-Muslims more sharply drawn. Muslims now lived within an elaborated system of ritual, doctrine and law clearly different from those of non-Muslims. (...) The status of Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians was more precisely defined, and in some ways it was inferior. They were regarded as the 'People of the Book', those who possessed a revealed scripture, or 'People of the Covenant', with whom compacts of protection had been made. In general they were not forced to convert, but they suffered from restrictions. They paid a special tax; they were not supposed to wear certain colors; they could not marry Muslim women;.\"<ref name=\"Hourani 2\"/>\t \n</blockquote>\n\nMost of these laws were elaborations of basic laws concerning non-Muslims (''[[dhimmi]]s'') in the [[Quran]]. The Quran does not give much detail about the right conduct with non-Muslims, in principle recognizing the religion of \"People of the book\" (Jews, Christians, and sometimes others as well) and securing a separate tax from them in lieu of the [[zakat]] imposed upon Muslim subjects.\n\n[[Ira M. Lapidus|Ira Lapidus]] points towards \"interwoven terms of political and economic benefits and of a sophisticated culture and religion\" as appealing to the masses.<ref name=\":0\">Lapidus, 271.</ref> He writes that :\n\n<blockquote>\"The question of why people convert to Islam has always generated intense feeling. Earlier generations of European scholars believed that conversions to Islam were made at the point of the sword, and that conquered peoples were given the choice of conversion or death. It is now apparent that conversion by force, while not unknown in Muslim countries, was, in fact, rare. Muslim conquerors ordinarily wished to dominate rather than convert, and most conversions to Islam were voluntary. (...) In most cases worldly and spiritual motives for conversion blended together. Moreover, conversion to Islam did not necessarily imply a complete turning from an old to a totally new life. While it entailed the acceptance of new religious beliefs and membership in a new religious community, most converts retained a deep attachment to the cultures and communities from which they came.\"<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>\n\nThe result of this, he points out, can be seen in the diversity of Muslim societies today, with varying manifestations and practices of Islam.\n\nConversion to Islam also came about as a result of the breakdown of historically religiously organized societies: with the weakening of many churches, for example, and the favoring of Islam and the migration of substantial Muslim Turkish populations into the areas of Anatolia and the Balkans, the \"social and cultural relevance of Islam\" were enhanced and a large number of peoples were converted. This worked better in some areas (Anatolia) and less in others (e.g. the Balkans, where \"the spread of Islam was limited by the vitality of the Christian churches.\")<ref name=\"Lapidus 4\"/>\n\nAlong with the religion of Islam, the Arabic language, number system and Arab customs spread throughout the empire. A sense of unity grew among many though not all provinces, gradually forming the consciousness of a broadly Arab-Islamic population: something which was recognizably an Islamic world had emerged by the end of the 10th century.<ref name=\"Hourani 11\">Hourani, pg.54</ref> Throughout this period, as well as in the following centuries, divisions occurred between Persians and Arabs, and Sunnis and Shiites, and unrest in provinces empowered local rulers at times.<ref name=\"Hourani 2\"/>\n\n====Conversion within the Empire: Umayyad Period vs. Abbasid Period====\nThere are a number of historians who see the rule of the Umayyads as responsible for setting up the \"dhimmah\"  to increase taxes from the ''[[dhimmi]]s'' to benefit the Arab Muslim community financially and to discourage conversion.<ref name=\"Astren\">Fred Astren pg.33-35</ref> Islam was initially associated with the ethnic identity of the Arabs and required formal association with an Arab tribe and the adoption of the client status of ''[[mawali]]''.<ref name=\"Astren\"/> Governors lodged complaints with the caliph when he enacted laws that made conversion easier, depriving the provinces of revenues from the tax on non-Muslims.\n\nDuring the following [[Abbasid]] period an enfranchisement was experienced by the ''mawali'' and a shift was made in the political conception from that of a primarily Arab empire to one of a Muslim empire<ref name=\"Tobin\">Tobin 113-115</ref> and c. 930 a law was enacted that required all bureaucrats of the empire to be Muslims.<ref name=\"Astren\"/> Both periods were also marked by significant migrations of Arab tribes outwards from the [[Arabian Peninsula]] into the new territories.<ref name=\"Tobin\"/>\n\n====Conversion within the Empire: \"Conversion curve\"====\n[[Richard Bulliet]]'s \"conversion curve\" shows a relatively low rate of conversion of non-Arab subjects during the Arab centric [[Umayyad]] period of 10%, in contrast with estimates for the more politically multicultural [[Abbasid]] period which saw the Muslim population grow from approx. 40% in the mid-9th century to close to 100% by the end of the 11th century.<ref name=\"Tobin\"/> This theory does not explain the continuing existence of large minorities of Christians in the Abbasid Period.

Crete was conquered during the 17th century, but the Ottomans lost Hungary to the Holy Roman Empire, and other parts of Eastern Europe, ending with the [[Treaty of Carlowitz]] in 1699.<ref name=\"Hourani 5\">Hourani, pg.221,222</ref>\n\n===Phase V: Post-Ottoman Empire to the present===\n{{further|Islamization#Modern day (1970s to present)}}\nIslam has continued to spread through commerce and migrations; especially in [[Southeast Asia]], [[Americas|America]] and [[Europe]].<ref name=\"Goddard\"/>\n\n== By region ==\n[[File:Map of expansion of Caliphate.svg|350px|thumb|right|Age of the [[Caliph]]s {{legend|#a1584e|Expansion under [[Muhammad]], 622\u2013632/A.H. 1-11}} {{legend|#ef9070|Expansion during the [[Rashidun Empire|Rashidun Caliphate]], 632\u2013661/A.H. 11-40}} {{legend|#fad07d|Expansion during the [[Umayyad]] [[Caliphate]], 661\u2013750/A.H. 40-129}}]]\n\n===Arabia===\n{{further|Early social changes under Islam}}\nAt [[Mecca]], [[Muhammad]] is said to have received repeated embassies from Christian tribes.\n\n===Greater Syria===\n{{main|Muslim conquest of the Levant}}\nLike their Byzantine and late Sasanian predecessors, the [[Marwanid]] caliphs nominally ruled the various religious communities but allowed the communities' own appointed or elected officials to administer most internal affairs. Yet the Marwanids also depended heavily on the help of non-Arab administrative personnel and on administrative practices (e.g., a set of government bureaus). As the conquests slowed and the isolation of the fighters (''muqatilah'') became less necessary, it became more and more difficult to keep Arabs garrisoned. As the tribal links that had so dominated Umayyad politics began to break down, the meaningfulness of tying non-Arab converts to Arab tribes as clients was diluted; moreover, the number of non-Muslims who wished to join the ummah was already becoming too large for this process to work effectively.\n\n===Palestine===\n{{further|Islamization of Jerusalem}}\n[[File:Temple Mount.JPG|thumb]]\n\nThe Great Muslim army siege Jerusalem, held by the Byzantine Romans, in November, 636 CE. For four months, the siege continued. Ultimately, the [[Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem]], [[Sophronius of Jerusalem|Sophronius]], an ethnic Arab,<ref>Donald E. Wagner. ''Dying in the Land of Promise: Palestine and Palestinian Christianity from Pentecost to 2000''</ref> agreed to surrender Jerusalem to [[caliph Omar]] in person. The caliph, then at Medina, agreed to these terms and travelled to [[Jerusalem]] to sign the capitulation in the spring of 637. Sophronius also negotiated a pact with Omar, known as the Umariyya Covenant or [[Umar's Assurance|Covenant of Omar]], allowing for religious freedom for Christians in exchange for \"[[jizya]]\", a tax to be paid by conquered non-Muslims, called \"[[dhimmis]]\". Under Muslim Rule, the Jewish and Christian population of Jerusalem in this period enjoyed the usual tolerance given to non-Muslim theists.<ref name=\"Catholic Jerusalem\">{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]] |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08355a.htm |year=1910 |title=Jerusalem}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Jew in the Medieval World: A Source Book, 315-1791 |last=Marcus |first=Jacob Rader |publisher=Hebrew Union College Press |date=March 2000 |isbn=0-87820-217-X |pages=[https://archive.org/details/jewinmedievalwor00marc/page/13 13\u201315] |edition=Revised |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/jewinmedievalwor00marc/page/13 }}</ref>\n\nHaving accepted the surrender, Omar then entered Jerusalem with Sophronius \"and courteously discoursed with the patriarch concerning its religious antiquities\".<ref>[[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]], ci, ed. Bury, London, 1898, V, 436</ref> When the hour for his prayer came, Omar was in the Anastasis church, but refused to pray there, lest in the future Muslims should use that as an excuse to break the treaty and confiscate the church. The [[Mosque of Omar]], opposite the doors of the Anastasis, with the tall minaret, is known as the place to which he retired for his prayer.\n\nBishop [[Arculf]], whose account of his pilgrimage to the Holy Land in the 7th century, [[De Locis Sanctis]], written down by the monk Adamnan, described reasonably pleasant living conditions of Christians in Palestine in the first period of Muslim rule. The caliphs of Damascus (661-750) were tolerant princes who were on generally good terms with their Christian subjects. Many Christians (e.g. St. John Damascene) held important offices at their court. The Abbasid caliphs at Baghdad (753-1242), as long as they ruled Syria, were also tolerant to Christians. Harun Abu-Ja-'afar (786-809), sent the keys of the [[Holy Sepulchre]] to Charlemagne, who built a hospice for Latin pilgrims near the shrine.<ref name=\"Catholic Jerusalem\" />\n\nRival dynasties and revolutions led to the eventual disunion of the Muslim world. In the 9th century, Palestine was conquered by the Shia Fatimid dynasty of North Africa. Palestine once again became a battleground as the various enemies of the Fatimids attacked. At the same time, the Byzantine Greeks continued to attempt to regain their lost territories, including Jerusalem. Christians in Jerusalem who sided with the Byzantines were put to death for high treason by the ruling shiite Muslims. In 969, the Patriarch of Jerusalem, John VII, was put to death for treasonous correspondence with the Byzantines. As Jerusalem grew in importance to Muslims and pilgrimages increased, tolerance for other religions declined. Christians were persecuted and churches destroyed. The sixth shia Fatimid caliph, [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah|Caliph Al-Hakim]], 996\u20131021, who was believed to be \"God made manifest\" by the [[Druze]], destroyed the Holy Sepulchre in 1009.

The victory of the Muslims over the Quraysh in the 7th century had a significant impact on local merchants and sailors, as their trading partners in Arabia had then all adopted [[Islam]], and the major trading routes in the [[Mediterranean]] and the [[Red Sea]] came under the sway of the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Muslim Caliphs]]. Through commerce, Islam spread amongst the Somali population in the coastal cities. Instability in the Arabian peninsula saw further migrations of early Muslim families to the Somali seaboard.

It is one of the finest examples of [[Islamic architecture]] in the [[Umayyad]] style; inspired the design of other Mosques in [[Al-Andalus]].]]\nThe history of Arab and Islamic rule in the Iberian peninsula is probably one of the most studied periods of European history. For centuries after the Arab conquest, European accounts of Arab rule in Iberia were negative. European points of view started changing with the [[Protestant Reformation]], which resulted in new descriptions of the period of Islamic rule in Spain as a \"golden age\" (mostly as a reaction against Spain's militant Roman Catholicism after 1500){{citation needed|date=February 2014}}.\n\nThe tide of Arab expansion after 630 rolled through North Africa up to Ceuta in present-day Morocco. Their arrival coincided with a period of political weakness in the three centuries old kingdom established in the Iberian peninsula by the Germanic [[Visigoths]], who had taken over the region after seven centuries of Roman rule. Seizing the opportunity, an Arab-led (but mostly Berber) army invaded in 711, and by 720 had conquered the southern and central regions of the peninsula. The Arab expansion pushed over the mountains into southern [[France]], and for a short period Arabs controlled the old Visigothic province of Septimania (centered on present-day Narbonne). The Arab Caliphate was pushed back by [[Charles Martel]] (Frankish Mayor of the Palace) at Poitiers, and Christian armies started pushing southwards over the mountains, until [[Charlemagne]] established in 801 the Spanish March (which stretched from Barcelona to present day Navarre).\n\nA major development in the history of Muslim Spain was the dynastic change in 750 in the Arab Caliphate, when an Umayyad Prince escaped the slaughter of his family in Damascus, fled to Cordoba in Spain, and created a new Islamic state in the area. This was the start of a distinctly Spanish Muslim society, where large Christian and Jewish populations coexisted with an increasing percentage of Muslims. There are many stories of descendants of Visigothic chieftains and Roman counts whose families converted to Islam during this period. The at-first small Muslim elite continued to grow with converts, and with a few exceptions, rulers in Islamic Spain allowed Christians and Jews the right specified in the Koran to practice their own religions, though non-Muslims suffered from political and taxation inequities. The net result was, in those areas of Spain where Muslim rule lasted the longest, the creation of a society that was mostly Arabic-speaking because of the assimilation of native inhabitants, a process in some ways similar to the assimilation many years later of millions of immigrants to the United States into English-speaking culture.  As the descendants of Visigoths and Hispano-Romans concentrated in the north of the peninsula, in the kingdoms of Asturias/Leon, Navarre and Aragon and started a long campaign known as the 'Reconquista' which started with the victory of the Christian armies in [[Covadonga]] in 722.  Military campaigns continued without pause.  In 1085 Alfonso VI of Castille took back Toledo.  In 1212 the crucial [[Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]] meant the recovery of the bulk of the peninsula for the Christian kingdoms.  In 1238 James I of Aragon  took Valencia.  In 1236 the ancient Roman city of [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia|Cordoba]] was re-conquered by Ferdinand III of Castille and in 1248 the city of [[Seville]].  The famous medieval epic poem '[[Cantar de Mio Cid]]' narrates the life and deeds of this hero during the [[Reconquista]].\n\nThe Islamic state centered in Cordoba had ended up splintering into many smaller kingdoms (the so-called taifas). While Muslim Spain was fragmenting, the Christian kingdoms grew larger and stronger, and the balance of power shifted against the 'Taifa' kingdoms. The last Muslim kingdom of Granada in the south was finally taken in 1492 by Queen Isabelle of Castille and Ferdinand of Aragon. In 1499, the remaining Muslim inhabitants were ordered to convert or leave (at the same time the Jews were expelled). Poorer Muslims ([[Moriscos]]) who could not afford to leave ended up converting to Catholic Christianity and hiding their Muslim practices, hiding from the Spanish Inquisition, until their presence was finally extinguished.\n\n====Balkans====\n{{see also|Rumelia|Balkans|Ottoman Empire}}\nIn Balkan history, historical writing on the topic of conversion to Islam was, and still is, a highly charged political issue. It is intrinsically linked to the issues of formation of national identities and rival territorial claims of the Balkan states. The generally accepted nationalist discourse of the current Balkan historiography defines all forms of Islamization as results of the Ottoman government's centrally organized policy of conversion or ''[[dawah]]''. The truth is that Islamization in each Balkan country took place in the course of many centuries, and its nature and phase was determined not by the Ottoman government but by the specific conditions of each locality. Ottoman conquests were initially military and economic enterprises, and religious conversions were not their primary objective. True, the statements surrounding victories all celebrated the incorporation of territory into Muslim domains, but the actual Ottoman focus was on taxation and making the realms productive, and a religious campaign would have disrupted that economic objective.\n\nOttoman Islamic standards of toleration allowed for autonomous \"nations\" (''[[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millets]]'') in the Empire, under their own personal law and under the rule of their own religious leaders. As a result, vast areas of the Balkans remained mostly Christian during the period of Ottoman domination. In fact, the Eastern Orthodox Churches had a higher position in the Ottoman Empire, mainly because the Patriarch resided in Istanbul and was an officer of the Ottoman Empire. In contrast, Roman Catholics, while tolerated, were suspected of loyalty to a foreign power (the Papacy). It is no surprise that the Roman Catholic areas of Bosnia, Kosovo and northern Albania, ended up with more substantial conversions to Islam. The defeat of the Ottomans in 1699 by the Austrians resulted in their loss of Hungary and present-day Croatia. The remaining Muslim converts in both elected to leave \"lands of unbelief\" and moved to territory still under the Ottomans. Around this point in time, new European ideas of romantic nationalism started to seep into the Empire, and provided the intellectual foundation for new nationalistic ideologies and the reinforcement of the self-image of many Christian groups as subjugated peoples.\n\nAs a rule, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] did not require followers of Greek Orthodoxy to become [[Muslim]]s, although many did so in order to avert the socioeconomic hardships of Ottoman rule<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pontosworld.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1387&Itemid=90|title=PontosWorld|publisher=}}</ref> \nOne by one, the Balkan nationalities asserted their independence from the Empire, and frequently the presence of members of the same ethnicity who had converted to Islam presented a problem from the point of view of the now dominant new national ideology, which narrowly defined the nation as members of the local dominant Orthodox Christian denomination.<ref name=\"Blumi32\"/> Some Muslims in the Balkans chose to leave, while [[Persecution of Muslims|many others were forcefully expelled]] to what was left of the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=\"Blumi32\">{{cite book|last=Blumi|first=Isa|title=Reinstating the Ottomans, Alternative Balkan Modernities: 1800\u20131912|year=2011|location=New York  |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ca3IAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Reinstating+the+Ottomans,+Alternative+Balkan+Modernities:+1800-1912&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=the%20expulsion%20of%20the%20%E2%80%9CTurks%E2%80%9D%20(i.e.%2C%20Muslims)&f=false|isbn=9780230119086|pages=32|ref=harv}}</ref>  This demographic transition can be illustrated by the decrease in the number of mosques in [[Belgrade]], from over 70 in 1750 (before Serbian independence in 1815), to only three in 1850.\n\n====Immigration====\nSince the 1960s, many Muslims have migrated to Western Europe.

The objective of the conquests was mostly of a practical nature, as fertile land and water were scarce in the Arabian peninsula. A real Islamization therefore only came about in the subsequent centuries.<ref name=\"Hourani 1\">Hourani, pg.22-24</ref>\n\n[[Ira Lapidus]] distinguishes between two separate strands of converts of the time: one is animists and polytheists of tribal societies of the Arabian peninsula and the [[Fertile crescent]]; the other one is the native Christians and Jews who existed peacefully before the Muslim invaders arrived.<ref name=\"Lapidus 4\">Lapidus, 200-201</ref>\n\nThe empire spread from the Atlantic Ocean to the [[Aral Sea]], from the [[Atlas Mountains]] to the [[Hindu Kush]], bounded mostly \"a combination of natural barriers and well-organized states\".<ref name=RGHIGP2015:207>[[#RGHIGP2015|Hoyland, ''In God's Path'', 2015]]: p.207</ref> \n\nFor the polytheistic and pagan societies, apart from the religious and spiritual reasons each individual may have had, conversion to Islam \"represented the response of a tribal, pastoral population to the need for a larger framework for political and economic integration, a more stable state, and a more imaginative and encompassing moral vision to cope with the problems of a tumultuous society.\"<ref name=\"Lapidus 4\"/> In contrast, for tribal, nomadic, monotheistic societies, \"Islam was substituted for a Byzantine or Sassanian political identity and for a Christian, Jewish or Zoroastrian religious affiliation.\"<ref name=\"Lapidus 4\"/> Conversion initially was neither required nor necessarily wished for: \"(The Arab conquerors) did not require the conversion as much as the subordination of non-Muslim peoples. At the outset, they were hostile to conversions because new Muslims diluted the economic and status advantages of the Arabs.\"<ref name=\"Lapidus 4\"/>\n\nOnly in subsequent centuries, with the development of the religious doctrine of Islam and with that the understanding of the Muslim [[ummah]], did mass conversion take place. The new understanding by the religious and political leadership in many cases led to a weakening or breakdown of the social and religious structures of parallel religious communities such as Christians and Jews.<ref name=\"Lapidus 4\"/>\n\nThe caliphs of the Arab dynasty established the first schools inside the empire which taught Arabic language and Islamic studies. They furthermore began the ambitious project of building mosques across the empire, many of which remain today as the most magnificent Mosques in the Islamic world, such as the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus. At the end of the Umayyad period, less than 10% of the people in Iran, Iraq, Syria, Egypt, Tunisia and Spain were Muslim. Only on the Arabian peninsula was the proportion of Muslims among the population higher than this.<ref name=\"Hourani 2\">Hourani, pg.41-48</ref>\n\n===Phase II: The Abbasids (750\u20131258)===\n{{see also|Abbasid Caliphate}}\n[[File:Mustansiriya University CPT.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]]s are known to have founded some of the world's earliest educational institutions such as the [[House of Wisdom]].]]\n\nThe Abbasid era replaced the expanding empire and \"tribal politics\" of \"the tight-knit Syro-Arabian elite<ref name=RGHIGP2015:207>[[#RGHIGP2015|Hoyland, ''In God's Path'', 2015]]: p.207</ref> with cosmopolitan culture and disciplines of Islamic [[Science in the medieval Islamic world|science]],<ref name=RGHIGP2015:207>[[#RGHIGP2015|Hoyland, ''In God's Path'', 2015]]: p.207</ref> [[islamic philosophy|philosophy]], [[Islamic theology|theology]], [[Islamic Law|law]] and [[Islamic mysticism|mysticism]] became more widespread and the gradual conversions of the populations within the empire occurred. Significant conversions also occurred beyond the extents of the empire such as that of the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic tribes]] in [[Central Asia]] and peoples living in regions south of the [[Sahara]] in [[Africa]] through contact with Muslim traders active in the area and [[Tariqah|Sufi orders]]. In Africa it spread along three routes, across the Sahara via trading towns such as [[Timbuktu]], up the [[Nile Valley]] through [[the Sudan]] up to [[Uganda]] and across the [[Red Sea]] and down [[East Africa]] through settlements such as [[Mombasa]] and [[Zanzibar]]. These initial conversions were of a flexible nature.\n\nThe reasons why, by the end of the 10th century, a large part of the population had converted to Islam are diverse. According to British-Lebanese historian [[Albert Hourani]], one of the reasons may be that\n<blockquote>  \t \n\"Islam had become more clearly defined, and the line between Muslims and non-Muslims more sharply drawn. Muslims now lived within an elaborated system of ritual, doctrine and law clearly different from those of non-Muslims. (...) The status of Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians was more precisely defined, and in some ways it was inferior. They were regarded as the 'People of the Book', those who possessed a revealed scripture, or 'People of the Covenant', with whom compacts of protection had been made. In general they were not forced to convert, but they suffered from restrictions. They paid a special tax; they were not supposed to wear certain colors; they could not marry Muslim women;.\"<ref name=\"Hourani 2\"/>\t \n</blockquote>\n\nMost of these laws were elaborations of basic laws concerning non-Muslims (''[[dhimmi]]s'') in the [[Quran]]. The Quran does not give much detail about the right conduct with non-Muslims, in principle recognizing the religion of \"People of the book\" (Jews, Christians, and sometimes others as well) and securing a separate tax from them in lieu of the [[zakat]] imposed upon Muslim subjects.\n\n[[Ira M. Lapidus|Ira Lapidus]] points towards \"interwoven terms of political and economic benefits and of a sophisticated culture and religion\" as appealing to the masses.<ref name=\":0\">Lapidus, 271.</ref> He writes that :\n\n<blockquote>\"The question of why people convert to Islam has always generated intense feeling. Earlier generations of European scholars believed that conversions to Islam were made at the point of the sword, and that conquered peoples were given the choice of conversion or death. It is now apparent that conversion by force, while not unknown in Muslim countries, was, in fact, rare. Muslim conquerors ordinarily wished to dominate rather than convert, and most conversions to Islam were voluntary. (...) In most cases worldly and spiritual motives for conversion blended together. Moreover, conversion to Islam did not necessarily imply a complete turning from an old to a totally new life. While it entailed the acceptance of new religious beliefs and membership in a new religious community, most converts retained a deep attachment to the cultures and communities from which they came.\"<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>\n\nThe result of this, he points out, can be seen in the diversity of Muslim societies today, with varying manifestations and practices of Islam.\n\nConversion to Islam also came about as a result of the breakdown of historically religiously organized societies: with the weakening of many churches, for example, and the favoring of Islam and the migration of substantial Muslim Turkish populations into the areas of Anatolia and the Balkans, the \"social and cultural relevance of Islam\" were enhanced and a large number of peoples were converted. This worked better in some areas (Anatolia) and less in others (e.g. the Balkans, where \"the spread of Islam was limited by the vitality of the Christian churches.\")<ref name=\"Lapidus 4\"/>\n\nAlong with the religion of Islam, the Arabic language, number system and Arab customs spread throughout the empire. A sense of unity grew among many though not all provinces, gradually forming the consciousness of a broadly Arab-Islamic population: something which was recognizably an Islamic world had emerged by the end of the 10th century.<ref name=\"Hourani 11\">Hourani, pg.54</ref> Throughout this period, as well as in the following centuries, divisions occurred between Persians and Arabs, and Sunnis and Shiites, and unrest in provinces empowered local rulers at times.<ref name=\"Hourani 2\"/>\n\n====Conversion within the Empire: Umayyad Period vs. Abbasid Period====\nThere are a number of historians who see the rule of the Umayyads as responsible for setting up the \"dhimmah\"  to increase taxes from the ''[[dhimmi]]s'' to benefit the Arab Muslim community financially and to discourage conversion.<ref name=\"Astren\">Fred Astren pg.33-35</ref> Islam was initially associated with the ethnic identity of the Arabs and required formal association with an Arab tribe and the adoption of the client status of ''[[mawali]]''.<ref name=\"Astren\"/> Governors lodged complaints with the caliph when he enacted laws that made conversion easier, depriving the provinces of revenues from the tax on non-Muslims.\n\nDuring the following [[Abbasid]] period an enfranchisement was experienced by the ''mawali'' and a shift was made in the political conception from that of a primarily Arab empire to one of a Muslim empire<ref name=\"Tobin\">Tobin 113-115</ref> and c. 930 a law was enacted that required all bureaucrats of the empire to be Muslims.<ref name=\"Astren\"/> Both periods were also marked by significant migrations of Arab tribes outwards from the [[Arabian Peninsula]] into the new territories.<ref name=\"Tobin\"/>\n\n====Conversion within the Empire: \"Conversion curve\"====\n[[Richard Bulliet]]'s \"conversion curve\" shows a relatively low rate of conversion of non-Arab subjects during the Arab centric [[Umayyad]] period of 10%, in contrast with estimates for the more politically multicultural [[Abbasid]] period which saw the Muslim population grow from approx. 40% in the mid-9th century to close to 100% by the end of the 11th century.<ref name=\"Tobin\"/> This theory does not explain the continuing existence of large minorities of Christians in the Abbasid Period. Other estimates suggest that Muslims were not a majority in Egypt until the mid-10th century and in the Fertile Crescent until 1100. Syria may have had a Christian majority within its modern borders until the Mongol Invasions of the 13th century.\n====Growth rate====\nIn addition to conversion to Islam, the Muslim population also grew from a higher birth rate than non-Muslims, a result of the right of Muslim men to marry four women, and possess numerous concubines and having the power to ensure their children were raised Muslims.<ref name=RGHIGP2015:229>[[#RGHIGP2015|Hoyland, ''In God's Path'', 2015]]: p.229</ref> \n\n===Phase III: Western Europe and the emergence of the Seljuks and Ottomans (950-1450)===\n{{see also|History of Islam in southern Italy}}\nThe expansion of Islam continued in the wake of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] conquests of [[Asia Minor]], the [[Balkans]], and the [[Indian subcontinent]].<ref name=\"Goddard\"/> The earlier period also saw the acceleration in the rate of conversions in the Muslim heartland while in the wake of the conquests the newly conquered regions retained significant non-Muslim populations in contrast to the regions where the boundaries of the Muslim world contracted, such as the [[Emirate of Sicily]] ([[Italy]]) and [[Al Andalus]] ([[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]), where Muslim populations were expelled or forced to [[Christianization|Christianize]] in short order.<ref name=\"Goddard\"/> The latter period of this phase was marked by the [[Mongol invasion]] (particularly the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|siege of Baghdad]] in 1258) and after an initial period of persecution, the conversion of these conquerors to Islam.\n\n===Phase IV: Ottoman Empire: 1299 - 1924===\n{{see also|Ottoman Empire}}\n[[File:Central europe 1683.png|thumb|200px|Territories in Central Europe under the [[Ottoman Empire]], 1683 CE.]]\nThe [[Ottoman Empire]] defended its frontiers initially against threats from several sides: the [[Safavids]] on the Eastern side, the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the North which vanished with the [[Conquest of Constantinople]] in 1453, and the great Catholic powers from the Mediterranean Sea: Spain, the Holy Roman Empire, and Venice with its eastern Mediterranean colonies.\n\nLater, the Ottoman Empire set on to conquer territories from these rivals: Cyprus and other Greek islands (except Crete) were lost by Venice to the Ottomans, and the latter conquered territory up to the Danube basin as far as Hungary. Crete was conquered during the 17th century, but the Ottomans lost Hungary to the Holy Roman Empire, and other parts of Eastern Europe, ending with the [[Treaty of Carlowitz]] in 1699.<ref name=\"Hourani 5\">Hourani, pg.221,222</ref>\n\n===Phase V: Post-Ottoman Empire to the present===\n{{further|Islamization#Modern day (1970s to present)}}\nIslam has continued to spread through commerce and migrations; especially in [[Southeast Asia]], [[Americas|America]] and [[Europe]].<ref name=\"Goddard\"/>\n\n== By region ==\n[[File:Map of expansion of Caliphate.svg|350px|thumb|right|Age of the [[Caliph]]s {{legend|#a1584e|Expansion under [[Muhammad]], 622\u2013632/A.H. 1-11}} {{legend|#ef9070|Expansion during the [[Rashidun Empire|Rashidun Caliphate]], 632\u2013661/A.H. 11-40}} {{legend|#fad07d|Expansion during the [[Umayyad]] [[Caliphate]], 661\u2013750/A.H. 40-129}}]]\n\n===Arabia===\n{{further|Early social changes under Islam}}\nAt [[Mecca]], [[Muhammad]] is said to have received repeated embassies from Christian tribes.\n\n===Greater Syria===\n{{main|Muslim conquest of the Levant}}\nLike their Byzantine and late Sasanian predecessors, the [[Marwanid]] caliphs nominally ruled the various religious communities but allowed the communities' own appointed or elected officials to administer most internal affairs. Yet the Marwanids also depended heavily on the help of non-Arab administrative personnel and on administrative practices (e.g., a set of government bureaus). As the conquests slowed and the isolation of the fighters (''muqatilah'') became less necessary, it became more and more difficult to keep Arabs garrisoned. As the tribal links that had so dominated Umayyad politics began to break down, the meaningfulness of tying non-Arab converts to Arab tribes as clients was diluted; moreover, the number of non-Muslims who wished to join the ummah was already becoming too large for this process to work effectively.\n\n===Palestine===\n{{further|Islamization of Jerusalem}}\n[[File:Temple Mount.JPG|thumb]]\n\nThe Great Muslim army siege Jerusalem, held by the Byzantine Romans, in November, 636 CE. For four months, the siege continued. Ultimately, the [[Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem]], [[Sophronius of Jerusalem|Sophronius]], an ethnic Arab,<ref>Donald E. Wagner. ''Dying in the Land of Promise: Palestine and Palestinian Christianity from Pentecost to 2000''</ref> agreed to surrender Jerusalem to [[caliph Omar]] in person. The caliph, then at Medina, agreed to these terms and travelled to [[Jerusalem]] to sign the capitulation in the spring of 637. Sophronius also negotiated a pact with Omar, known as the Umariyya Covenant or [[Umar's Assurance|Covenant of Omar]], allowing for religious freedom for Christians in exchange for \"[[jizya]]\", a tax to be paid by conquered non-Muslims, called \"[[dhimmis]]\". Under Muslim Rule, the Jewish and Christian population of Jerusalem in this period enjoyed the usual tolerance given to non-Muslim theists.<ref name=\"Catholic Jerusalem\">{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]] |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08355a.htm |year=1910 |title=Jerusalem}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Jew in the Medieval World: A Source Book, 315-1791 |last=Marcus |first=Jacob Rader |publisher=Hebrew Union College Press |date=March 2000 |isbn=0-87820-217-X |pages=[https://archive.org/details/jewinmedievalwor00marc/page/13 13\u201315] |edition=Revised |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/jewinmedievalwor00marc/page/13 }}</ref>\n\nHaving accepted the surrender, Omar then entered Jerusalem with Sophronius \"and courteously discoursed with the patriarch concerning its religious antiquities\".<ref>[[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]], ci, ed. Bury, London, 1898, V, 436</ref> When the hour for his prayer came, Omar was in the Anastasis church, but refused to pray there, lest in the future Muslims should use that as an excuse to break the treaty and confiscate the church. The [[Mosque of Omar]], opposite the doors of the Anastasis, with the tall minaret, is known as the place to which he retired for his prayer.\n\nBishop [[Arculf]], whose account of his pilgrimage to the Holy Land in the 7th century, [[De Locis Sanctis]], written down by the monk Adamnan, described reasonably pleasant living conditions of Christians in Palestine in the first period of Muslim rule. The caliphs of Damascus (661-750) were tolerant princes who were on generally good terms with their Christian subjects. Many Christians (e.g. St. John Damascene) held important offices at their court. The Abbasid caliphs at Baghdad (753-1242), as long as they ruled Syria, were also tolerant to Christians. Harun Abu-Ja-'afar (786-809), sent the keys of the [[Holy Sepulchre]] to Charlemagne, who built a hospice for Latin pilgrims near the shrine.<ref name=\"Catholic Jerusalem\" />\n\nRival dynasties and revolutions led to the eventual disunion of the Muslim world. In the 9th century, Palestine was conquered by the Shia Fatimid dynasty of North Africa. Palestine once again became a battleground as the various enemies of the Fatimids attacked. At the same time, the Byzantine Greeks continued to attempt to regain their lost territories, including Jerusalem. Christians in Jerusalem who sided with the Byzantines were put to death for high treason by the ruling shiite Muslims. In 969, the Patriarch of Jerusalem, John VII, was put to death for treasonous correspondence with the Byzantines. As Jerusalem grew in importance to Muslims and pilgrimages increased, tolerance for other religions declined. Christians were persecuted and churches destroyed. The sixth shia Fatimid caliph, [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah|Caliph Al-Hakim]], 996\u20131021, who was believed to be \"God made manifest\" by the [[Druze]], destroyed the Holy Sepulchre in 1009.

These clans came to serve as catalysts, forwarding the faith to large parts of the Horn region.<ref name=\"lcweb2.loc.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+so0014)|title=A Country Study: Somalia from The Library of Congress|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n====East Africa====\n{{see also|Shirazi people}}\n[[File:East Africa, c.1500.jpg|thumb|150px| Principal cities of East Africa, c. 1500.

From there Arab trade routes into the interior of Africa helped the slow acceptance of Islam.\n\nBy the 10th century, the [[Kilwa Sultanate]] was founded by [[Ali ibn al-Hassan Shirazi]] (was one of seven sons of a ruler of [[Shiraz]], Persia, his mother an [[Habesha people|Abyssinian]] slave girl. Upon his father's death, Ali was driven out of his inheritance by his brothers). His successors would rule the most powerful of [[Sultanate]]s in the [[Swahili coast]], during the peak of its expansion the [[Kilwa Sultanate]] stretched from [[Inhambane]] in the south to [[Malindi]] in the north. The 13th-century [[Muslim]] traveller [[Ibn Battuta]] noted that the great mosque of [[Kilwa Kisiwani]] was made of [[Coral|coral stone]] (the only one of its kind in the world).\n\nIn the 20th century, Islam grew in Africa both by birth and by conversion.  The number of Muslims in Africa grew from 34.5 million in 1900 to 315 million in 2000, going from roughly 20% to 40% of the total population of Africa.<ref name=\"valpo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.valpo.edu/cresset/2009/Trinity/Sanneh_T09.htm|title=The Return of Religion: Currents of Resurgence, Convergence, and Divergence- The Cresset (Trinity 2009)|accessdate=22 June 2011}}</ref> However, in the same time period, the number of Christians also grew in Africa, from 8.7 million in 1900 to 346 million in 2000, surpassing both the total population as well as the growth rate of Islam on the continent.<ref name=\"valpo\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/facts/fm0146.htm|title=Christian Number-Crunching reveals impressive growth|accessdate=22 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Western Africa====\n{{further|Islamization of the Sudan region}}\n[[File:Great Mosque of Djenn\u00e9 1.jpg|thumb|150px|The Great Mosque of [[Djenn\u00e9]].]]\nThe spread of Islam in Africa began in the 7th to 9th century, brought to North Africa initially under the [[Umayyad Dynasty]].  Extensive trade networks throughout North and West Africa created a medium through which Islam spread peacefully, initially through the merchant class. By sharing a common religion and a common transliteralization ([[Arabic]]), traders showed greater willingness to trust, and therefore invest, in one another.<ref>[http://www.press.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/hfs.cgi/00/14758.ctl Paul Stoller, \"Money Has No Smell: The Africanization of New York City,\" Chicago: University of Chicago Press] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223162442/http://www.press.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/hfs.cgi/00/14758.ctl |date=2007-12-23 }} {{ISBN|978-0-226-77529-6}}</ref> Moreover, toward the 19th century, the [[Nigeria]] based [[Sokoto Caliphate]] led by [[Usman dan Fodio]] exerted considerable effort in spreading Islam.<ref name=\"Arnold\" />\n\n===Europe===\n[[Tariq ibn Ziyad]] was a [[Muslim]] general who led the Islamic conquest of [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] [[Hispania]] in 711-718 A.D. He is considered to be one of the most important military commanders in [[Iberia]]n history. The name \"[[Gibraltar]]\" is the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] derivation of the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] name ''Jabal T\u0101riq'' ({{lang|ar|{{big|\u062c\u0628\u0644 \u0637\u0627\u0631\u0642}}}}) (meaning \"mountain of Tariq\"), named after him.\n\nThere are accounts of the [[Volga trade route|trade connections]] between the Muslims and the [[Rus' (people)|Rus]], apparently Vikings who made their way towards the [[Black Sea]] through [[European Russia|Central Russia]].  On his way to Volga Bulgaria, [[Ibn Fadlan]] brought detailed reports of the Rus, claiming that some had converted to [[Islam]].\n\nAccording to the historian [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]], the [[B\u00f6sz\u00f6rm\u00e9ny]] (''Izmaelita or ''Ismaili{{\\}}[[Nizari]]'') denomination of the Muslims who lived in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in the 10th to 13th centuries, were employed as mercenaries by the kings of Hungary.\n\n====Hispania / Al-Andalus====\n{{see also|Umayyad conquest of Hispania}}\n[[File:Spain Andalusia Cordoba BW 2015-10-27 14-33-43.jpg|thumb|upright|The interior of the [[Cathedral\u2013Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba|Cathedral of Cordoba]], formerly the [[Great Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba]] was built in 742. It is one of the finest examples of [[Islamic architecture]] in the [[Umayyad]] style; inspired the design of other Mosques in [[Al-Andalus]].]]\nThe history of Arab and Islamic rule in the Iberian peninsula is probably one of the most studied periods of European history. For centuries after the Arab conquest, European accounts of Arab rule in Iberia were negative. European points of view started changing with the [[Protestant Reformation]], which resulted in new descriptions of the period of Islamic rule in Spain as a \"golden age\" (mostly as a reaction against Spain's militant Roman Catholicism after 1500){{citation needed|date=February 2014}}.\n\nThe tide of Arab expansion after 630 rolled through North Africa up to Ceuta in present-day Morocco. Their arrival coincided with a period of political weakness in the three centuries old kingdom established in the Iberian peninsula by the Germanic [[Visigoths]], who had taken over the region after seven centuries of Roman rule. Seizing the opportunity, an Arab-led (but mostly Berber) army invaded in 711, and by 720 had conquered the southern and central regions of the peninsula. The Arab expansion pushed over the mountains into southern [[France]], and for a short period Arabs controlled the old Visigothic province of Septimania (centered on present-day Narbonne). The Arab Caliphate was pushed back by [[Charles Martel]] (King of the Franks or French) at Poitiers, and Christian armies started pushing southwards over the mountains, until [[Charlemagne]] established in 801 the Spanish March (which stretched from Barcelona to present day Navarre).\n\nA major development in the history of Muslim Spain was the dynastic change in 750 in the Arab Caliphate, when an Umayyad Prince escaped the slaughter of his family in Damascus, fled to Cordoba in Spain, and created a new Islamic state in the area. This was the start of a distinctly Spanish Muslim society, where large Christian and Jewish populations coexisted with an increasing percentage of Muslims. There are many stories of descendants of Visigothic chieftains and Roman counts whose families converted to Islam during this period. The at-first small Muslim elite continued to grow with converts, and with a few exceptions, rulers in Islamic Spain allowed Christians and Jews the right specified in the Koran to practice their own religions, though non-Muslims suffered from political and taxation inequities. The net result was, in those areas of Spain where Muslim rule lasted the longest, the creation of a society that was mostly Arabic-speaking because of the assimilation of native inhabitants, a process in some ways similar to the assimilation many years later of millions of immigrants to the United States into English-speaking culture.  As the descendants of Visigoths and Hispano-Romans concentrated in the north of the peninsula, in the kingdoms of Asturias/Leon, Navarre and Aragon and started a long campaign known as the 'Reconquista' which started with the victory of the Christian armies in [[Covadonga]] in 722.  Military campaigns continued without pause.  In 1085 Alfonso VI of Castille took back Toledo.  In 1212 the crucial [[Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]] meant the recovery of the bulk of the peninsula for the Christian kingdoms.  In 1238 James I of Aragon  took Valencia.  In 1236 the ancient Roman city of [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia|Cordoba]] was re-conquered by Ferdinand III of Castille and in 1248 the city of [[Seville]].  The famous medieval epic poem '[[Cantar de Mio Cid]]' narrates the life and deeds of this hero during the [[Reconquista]].\n\nThe Islamic state centered in Cordoba had ended up splintering into many smaller kingdoms (the so-called taifas). While Muslim Spain was fragmenting, the Christian kingdoms grew larger and stronger, and the balance of power shifted against the 'Taifa' kingdoms. The last Muslim kingdom of Granada in the south was finally taken in 1492 by Queen Isabelle of Castille and Ferdinand of Aragon. In 1499, the remaining Muslim inhabitants were ordered to convert or leave (at the same time the Jews were expelled). Poorer Muslims ([[Moriscos]]) who could not afford to leave ended up converting to Catholic Christianity and hiding their Muslim practices, hiding from the Spanish Inquisition, until their presence was finally extinguished.\n\n====Balkans====\n{{see also|Rumelia|Balkans|Ottoman Empire}}\nIn Balkan history, historical writing on the topic of conversion to Islam was, and still is, a highly charged political issue. It is intrinsically linked to the issues of formation of national identities and rival territorial claims of the Balkan states. The generally accepted nationalist discourse of the current Balkan historiography defines all forms of Islamization as results of the Ottoman government's centrally organized policy of conversion or ''[[dawah]]''. The truth is that Islamization in each Balkan country took place in the course of many centuries, and its nature and phase was determined not by the Ottoman government but by the specific conditions of each locality. Ottoman conquests were initially military and economic enterprises, and religious conversions were not their primary objective. True, the statements surrounding victories all celebrated the incorporation of territory into Muslim domains, but the actual Ottoman focus was on taxation and making the realms productive, and a religious campaign would have disrupted that economic objective.\n\nOttoman Islamic standards of toleration allowed for autonomous \"nations\" (''[[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millets]]'') in the Empire, under their own personal law and under the rule of their own religious leaders. As a result, vast areas of the Balkans remained mostly Christian during the period of Ottoman domination. In fact, the Eastern Orthodox Churches had a higher position in the Ottoman Empire, mainly because the Patriarch resided in Istanbul and was an officer of the Ottoman Empire. In contrast, Roman Catholics, while tolerated, were suspected of loyalty to a foreign power (the Papacy). It is no surprise that the Roman Catholic areas of Bosnia, Kosovo and northern Albania, ended up with more substantial conversions to Islam. The defeat of the Ottomans in 1699 by the Austrians resulted in their loss of Hungary and present-day Croatia. The remaining Muslim converts in both elected to leave \"lands of unbelief\" and moved to territory still under the Ottomans. Around this point in time, new European ideas of romantic nationalism started to seep into the Empire, and provided the intellectual foundation for new nationalistic ideologies and the reinforcement of the self-image of many Christian groups as subjugated peoples.\n\nAs a rule, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] did not require followers of Greek Orthodoxy to become [[Muslim]]s, although many did so in order to avert the socioeconomic hardships of Ottoman rule<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pontosworld.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1387&Itemid=90|title=PontosWorld|publisher=}}</ref> \nOne by one, the Balkan nationalities asserted their independence from the Empire, and frequently the presence of members of the same ethnicity who had converted to Islam presented a problem from the point of view of the now dominant new national ideology, which narrowly defined the nation as members of the local dominant Orthodox Christian denomination.<ref name=\"Blumi32\"/> Some Muslims in the Balkans chose to leave, while [[Persecution of Muslims|many others were forcefully expelled]] to what was left of the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=\"Blumi32\">{{cite book|last=Blumi|first=Isa|title=Reinstating the Ottomans, Alternative Balkan Modernities: 1800\u20131912|year=2011|location=New York  |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ca3IAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Reinstating+the+Ottomans,+Alternative+Balkan+Modernities:+1800-1912&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=the%20expulsion%20of%20the%20%E2%80%9CTurks%E2%80%9D%20(i.e.%2C%20Muslims)&f=false|isbn=9780230119086|pages=32|ref=harv}}</ref>  This demographic transition can be illustrated by the decrease in the number of mosques in [[Belgrade]], from over 70 in 1750 (before Serbian independence in 1815), to only three in 1850.\n\n====Immigration====\nSince the 1960s, many Muslims have migrated to Western Europe.

These notes were not primarily designed to circulate and were payable to the original purchaser of the dollar bill. The obverse of the note featured a [[bald eagle]].\n*'''1862:''' The first circulating $50 bill was issued.\n*'''1863:''' Both one and two-year Interest Bearing Notes were issued that paid 5% interest. The one-year Interest Bearing Notes featured a [[Vignetting|vignette]] of Alexander Hamilton to the left and an [[allegorical]] figure representing loyalty to the right. The two-year notes featured allegorical figures of loyalty and justice.\n* '''1864:''' [[Compound Interest Treasury Note]]s were issued, intended to circulate for three years and paying 6% interest compounded semi-annually. The obverse is similar to the ''Series of 1863'' one-year Interest Bearing Note.\n*'''1865:''' Three-year Interest Bearing Notes were issued again with a slightly different bald eagle and border design on the obverse.\n*1869: A new $50 United States Note was issued with a portrait of [[Henry Clay]] on the right and an allegorical figure holding a [[Bay Laurel|laurel]] branch on the left of the obverse.\n* 1870: $50 [[National Gold Bank Note]]s were issued specifically for payment in gold coin by 2 national gold banks. The obverse featured vignettes of [[George Washington]] crossing the [[Delaware River]] and at [[Valley Forge]]; the reverse featured a vignette of U.S. gold coins.\n*1874: Another new $50 United States Note was issued with a portrait of [[Benjamin Franklin]] on the left and allegorical figure of [[Liberty (goddess)|Lady Liberty]] on the right of the obverse.\n*1878: The first $50 [[Silver certificate (United States)|silver certificate]] was issued with a portrait of [[Edward Everett]]. The reverse was printed in black ink.\n*1880: The ''Series of 1878'' Silver Certificate was slightly revised.\n*1882: The first $50 [[gold certificate]] with a portrait of [[Silas Wright]] was issued. The reverse was printed in orange ink and featured a bald eagle perched atop an [[American flag]].\n*1891: The obverse of the $50 Silver Certificate was slightly revised and the reverse was completely changed.\n*1891: The $50 Treasury or \"Coin Note\" was issued and given for government purchases of silver bullion from the silver mining industry. The note featured a portrait of [[William H. Seward]].\n*1913: A new $50 gold certificate with a portrait of [[Ulysses Grant]] was issued. The style of the area below Grant's portrait was later used on small-sized notes.\n*1914: The first $50 [[Federal Reserve Note]] was issued with a portrait of Ulysses Grant on the obverse and an allegorical figure of [[Panama]] between a [[merchant ship|merchant]] and [[battle ship]] on the reverse.\n*1918: [[Federal Reserve Bank Note]]s (''not to be confused with Federal Reserve Notes'') were issued by the [[Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis]]. The obverse was similar to the 1914 Federal Reserve Notes, except for large wording in the middle of the bill and a portrait with no border on the left side of the bill. The note was an obligation of the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank and could only be redeemed there.\n\n===Small size notes===\n''(6.14 \u00d7 2.61 in \u2245 156 \u00d7 66&nbsp;mm)''\n\n[[File:US-$50-FRBN-1929-Fr.1880-B.jpg|thumb|245px|right|''Series of 1929'' [[Federal Reserve Bank Note]].]]\n\n*1929: Under the [[Series of 1928 (United States Currency)|''Series of 1928'']], all U.S. currency was changed to its current size. All variations of the $50 bill would carry the same portrait of Ulysses S. Grant, same border design on the [[obverse]], and the same [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] with a vignette of the U.S. Capitol showing the east front. The $50 bill was issued as a [[Federal Reserve Note]] with a green [[Seal of the United States Department of the Treasury|seal]] and serial numbers and as a [[gold certificate]] with a golden seal and serial numbers.\n*1933: As an emergency response to the [[Great Depression]], additional money was pumped into the American economy through Federal Reserve Bank Notes issued under ''Series of 1929''. This was the only small-sized $50 bill that had a different border design on the obverse. The serial numbers and seal on it were brown.\n*1934: The redeemable in gold clause was removed from Federal Reserve Notes due to the U.S. withdrawing from the [[gold standard]].\n*1950: Many minor aspects on the obverse of the $50 Federal Reserve Note were changed. Most noticeably, the treasury seal, gray word {{sc|FIFTY}}, and the Federal Reserve Seal were made smaller; also, the Federal Reserve seal had spikes added around the perimeter, like the Treasury seal.\n*1966: {{sc|WILL PAY TO THE BEARER ON DEMAND}} was removed from the obverse and {{sc|IN GOD WE TRUST}} was added to the reverse of the $50 Federal Reserve Note beginning with ''Series 1963A''. Also, the obligation was shortened to its current wording, {{sc|THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER FOR ALL DEBTS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE}}.\n*1969: The $50 bill began using the new treasury seal with wording in [[English language|English]] instead of [[Latin]].\n*1991: The first new-age anti-counterfeiting measures were introduced under ''Series 1990'' with microscopic printing around Grant's portrait and a plastic security strip on the left side of the bill. Even though the bills read Series 1990, the first bills were printed in November 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uspapermoney.info/serials/f1990_l.html|title=USPaperMoney.Info: Series 1990 $50|publisher=}}</ref>\n*October 27, 1997: The first major redesign of the $50 note since 1929 was implemented as ''Series 1996'' to further deter [[counterfeit]]ers. Included were an enlarged and off-center portrait, an enlarged and updated view of the U.S. Capitol now showing the west front on the reverse, a security thread which glows yellow under [[ultraviolet]] light, a numeric ''50'' which shifts color from black to green when tilted, and a [[watermark]] of Grant. Also, for those with vision limitations, a large dark ''50'' was added to the bottom left corner of the reverse. The Federal Reserve seal was also changed to a unified Federal Reserve System seal and an additional prefix letter was added to the beginning of the bill's serial number. The first bills were printed in July 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uspapermoney.info/serials/f1996_l.html|title=USPaperMoney.Info: Series 1996 $50|publisher=}}</ref>\n*September 28, 2004: A revised design was implemented, as ''Series 2004'', with the first use of multiple colors since the 1905 $20 gold certificate. Around the new border-less portrait of [[Ulysses S. Grant|Ulysses Grant]] appears a subtle, stylized blue and red background image of the [[Flag of the United States|American Flag]]. A small silver-blue star was also added to the lower right of Grant's portrait. All previous ''Series 1996'' security features were included, although the color-shifting numeric 50 now shifts from copper to green. The [[Oval (geometry)|oval]] border and fine lines surrounding the U.S. Capitol on the reverse have been removed and replaced with sky and clouds. The new design also seems to have the \"[[EURion constellation]]\" on the back to prevent [[photocopying]] of the bill. The 2004 bills have the signature combination of [[Rosario Marin|Marin]]-[[John W. Snow|Snow]]. The first bills were printed in March 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uspapermoney.info/serials/f2004_l.html|title=USPaperMoney.Info: Series 2004 $50|publisher=}}</ref> This marked the first notes printed at the Western Currency Facility in [[Fort Worth, Texas]]; all notes have been printed there ever since.\n\n===Series dates===\n\n====Small size====\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

These notes were not primarily designed to circulate and were payable to the original purchaser of the dollar bill. The obverse of the note featured a [[bald eagle]].\n*'''1862:''' The first circulating $50 bill was issued.\n*'''1863:''' Both one and two-year Interest Bearing Notes were issued that paid 5% interest. The one-year Interest Bearing Notes featured a [[Vignetting|vignette]] of Alexander Hamilton to the left and an [[allegorical]] figure representing loyalty to the right. The two-year notes featured allegorical figures of loyalty and justice.\n* '''1864:''' [[Compound Interest Treasury Note]]s were issued, intended to circulate for three years and paying 6% interest compounded semi-annually. The obverse is similar to the ''Series of 1863'' one-year Interest Bearing Note.\n*'''1865:''' Three-year Interest Bearing Notes were issued again with a slightly different bald eagle and border design on the obverse.\n*1869: A new $50 United States Note was issued with a portrait of [[Henry Clay]] on the right and an allegorical figure holding a [[Bay Laurel|laurel]] branch on the left of the obverse.\n* 1870: $50 [[National Gold Bank Note]]s were issued specifically for payment in gold coin by 2 national gold banks. The obverse featured vignettes of [[George Washington]] crossing the [[Delaware River]] and at [[Valley Forge]]; the reverse featured a vignette of U.S. gold coins.\n*1874: Another new $50 United States Note was issued with a portrait of [[Benjamin Franklin]] on the left and allegorical figure of [[Liberty (goddess)|Lady Liberty]] on the right of the obverse.\n*1878: The first $50 [[Silver certificate (United States)|silver certificate]] was issued with a portrait of [[Edward Everett]]. The reverse was printed in black ink.\n*1880: The ''Series of 1878'' Silver Certificate was slightly revised.\n*1882: The first $50 [[gold certificate]] with a portrait of [[Silas Wright]] was issued. The reverse was printed in orange ink and featured a bald eagle perched atop an [[American flag]].\n*1891: The obverse of the $50 Silver Certificate was slightly revised and the reverse was completely changed.\n*1891: The $50 Treasury or \"Coin Note\" was issued and given for government purchases of silver bullion from the silver mining industry. The note featured a portrait of [[William H. Seward]].\n*1913: A new $50 gold certificate with a portrait of [[Ulysses Grant]] was issued. The style of the area below Grant's portrait was later used on small-sized notes.\n*1914: The first $50 [[Federal Reserve Note]] was issued with a portrait of Ulysses Grant on the obverse and an allegorical figure of [[Panama]] between a [[merchant ship|merchant]] and [[battle ship]] on the reverse.\n*1918: [[Federal Reserve Bank Note]]s (''not to be confused with Federal Reserve Notes'') were issued by the [[Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis]]. The obverse was similar to the 1914 Federal Reserve Notes, except for large wording in the middle of the bill and a portrait with no border on the left side of the bill. The note was an obligation of the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank and could only be redeemed there.\n\n===Small size notes===\n''(6.14 \u00d7 2.61 in \u2245 156 \u00d7 66&nbsp;mm)''\n\n[[File:US-$50-FRBN-1929-Fr.1880-B.jpg|thumb|245px|right|''Series of 1929'' [[Federal Reserve Bank Note]].]]\n\n*1929: Under the [[Series of 1928 (United States Currency)|''Series of 1928'']], all U.S. currency was changed to its current size. All variations of the $50 bill would carry the same portrait of Ulysses S. Grant, same border design on the [[obverse]], and the same [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] with a vignette of the U.S. Capitol showing the east front. The $50 bill was issued as a [[Federal Reserve Note]] with a green [[Seal of the United States Department of the Treasury|seal]] and serial numbers and as a [[gold certificate]] with a golden seal and serial numbers.\n*1933: As an emergency response to the [[Great Depression]], additional money was pumped into the American economy through Federal Reserve Bank Notes issued under ''Series of 1929''. This was the only small-sized $50 bill that had a different border design on the obverse. The serial numbers and seal on it were brown.\n*1934: The redeemable in gold clause was removed from Federal Reserve Notes due to the U.S. withdrawing from the [[gold standard]].\n*1950: Many minor aspects on the obverse of the $50 Federal Reserve Note were changed. Most noticeably, the treasury seal, gray word {{sc|FIFTY}}, and the Federal Reserve Seal were made smaller; also, the Federal Reserve seal had spikes added around the perimeter, like the Treasury seal.\n*1966: {{sc|WILL PAY TO THE BEARER ON DEMAND}} was removed from the obverse and {{sc|IN GOD WE TRUST}} was added to the reverse of the $50 Federal Reserve Note beginning with ''Series 1963A''. Also, the obligation was shortened to its current wording, {{sc|THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER FOR ALL DEBTS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE}}.\n*1969: The $50 bill began using the new treasury seal with wording in [[English language|English]] instead of [[Latin]].\n*1991: The first new-age anti-counterfeiting measures were introduced under ''Series 1990'' with microscopic printing around Grant's portrait and a plastic security strip on the left side of the bill. Even though the bills read Series 1990, the first bills were printed in November 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uspapermoney.info/serials/f1990_l.html|title=USPaperMoney.Info: Series 1990 $50|publisher=}}</ref>\n*October 27, 1997: The first major redesign of the $50 note since 1929 was implemented as ''Series 1996'' to further deter [[counterfeit]]ers. Included were an enlarged and off-center portrait, an enlarged and updated view of the U.S. Capitol now showing the west front on the reverse, a security thread which glows yellow under [[ultraviolet]] light, a numeric ''50'' which shifts color from black to green when tilted, and a [[watermark]] of Grant. Also, for those with vision limitations, a large dark ''50'' was added to the bottom left corner of the reverse. The Federal Reserve seal was also changed to a unified Federal Reserve System seal and an additional prefix letter was added to the beginning of the bill's serial number. The first bills were printed in July 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uspapermoney.info/serials/f1996_l.html|title=USPaperMoney.Info: Series 1996 $50|publisher=}}</ref>\n*September 28, 2004: A revised design was implemented, as ''Series 2004'', with the first use of multiple colors since the 1905 $20 gold certificate. Around the new border-less portrait of [[Ulysses S. Grant|Ulysses Grant]] appears a subtle, stylized blue and red background image of the [[Flag of the United States|American Flag]]. A small silver-blue star was also added to the lower right of Grant's portrait. All previous ''Series 1996'' security features were included, although the color-shifting numeric 50 now shifts from copper to green. The [[Oval (geometry)|oval]] border and fine lines surrounding the U.S. Capitol on the reverse have been removed and replaced with sky and clouds. The new design also seems to have the \"[[EURion constellation]]\" on the back to prevent [[photocopying]] of the bill. The 2004 bills have the signature combination of [[Rosario Marin|Marin]]-[[John W. Snow|Snow]]. The first bills were printed in March 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uspapermoney.info/serials/f2004_l.html|title=USPaperMoney.Info: Series 2004 $50|publisher=}}</ref> This marked the first notes printed at the Western Currency Facility in [[Fort Worth, Texas]]; all notes have been printed there ever since.\n\n===Series dates===\n\n====Small size====\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

He was particularly interested in visiting Buddhist temples and gardens in [[Kyoto]] and [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]. During his final trip to Japan shortly after his diagnosis, Doncourt visited Sanj\u016bsangen-d\u014d, a Buddhist temple of the Tendai sect in the Higashiyama district of Kyoto, several times. He produced a detailed drawing in the Hall of the Lotus King, where1,001 statues and their guardians stand. That drawing became the basis for his final painting, a large canvas portraying multiple rows of golden Kannon with a guardian statue in the foreground. The specific guardian Doncourt chose to focus on is named Sakara Ryu-o (literally the Sakara King of Dragons). He relied on memory alone to recreate the colors.  In September 2019, a kindred spirit, Lisa Schell, and her friend, an editor from the ''Kyoto Visitor\u2019s Guide'', expressed interest in using Doncourt\u2019s painting for the cover of an upcoming issue, with an accompanying article about 'the immortal force of compassion and mercy' that inspired him at Sanj\u016bsangen-d\u014d.

During his final trip to Japan shortly after his diagnosis, Doncourt visited Sanj\u016bsangen-d\u014d, a Buddhist temple of the Tendai sect in the Higashiyama district of Kyoto, several times. He produced a detailed drawing in the Hall of the Lotus King, where1,001 statues and their guardians stand. That drawing became the basis for his final painting, a large canvas portraying multiple rows of golden Kannon with a guardian statue in the foreground. The specific guardian Doncourt chose to focus on is named Sakara Ryu-o (literally the Sakara King of Dragons). He relied on memory alone to recreate the colors.  In September 2019, a kindred spirit, Lisa Schell, and her friend, an editor from the ''Kyoto Visitor\u2019s Guide'', expressed interest in using Doncourt\u2019s painting for the cover of an upcoming issue, with an accompanying article about 'the immortal force of compassion and mercy' that inspired him at Sanj\u016bsangen-d\u014d. The magazine offered Doncourt's estate an opportunity to showcase his artwork, and his lyrics about the nearby Philosopher\u2019s Path.<ref name=\":2\" /> The issue was published in February 2020.  \n \n== Discography == \n* 1978: Cathedral - ''Stained Glass Stories'', Delta Records<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/de/artist/1441714-Cathedral-3|title=Cathedral (3)|website=Discogs|language=de|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n* 2002: Thomas Doncourt - ''Fauve,'' self released<ref>{{Citation|title=Fauve by Thomas Doncourt|url=https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/thomas_doncourt/fauve/|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n* 2007: Cathedral - ''The Bridge'', self released<ref name=\":8\" /> \n* 2009: FauveMuseum - ''Blacklight,'' self released<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/FauveMuseum-Blacklight/release/5544720|title=FauveMuseum - Blacklight|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n* 2014: Tom Doncourt - ''The Mortal Coil,'' self released<ref name=\":6\" /> \n* 2015: Tom Doncourt - ''The Moon Will Rise,'' self released<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/de/artist/1441713-Tom-Doncourt|title=Tom Doncourt|website=Discogs|language=de|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n* 2017: Tom Doncourt - ''House in the Woods,'' self released<ref name=\":7\" /> \n* 2018: Tom Doncourt & Nadia Ratsimandresy - ''Ratsimandresy & Doncourt, Volume 1'', self released<ref>{{Citation|title=\u266b Ratsimandresy & Doncourt, Vol. 1 - Tom Doncourt.
