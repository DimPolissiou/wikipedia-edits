In this process, the threat is characterized by the perceived removal of Christian or Jewish symbols, the imposition of Islamic traditions, and the creation of [[no-go area]]s for non-Muslims. The construction of [[mosques]] in particular is seen as continued reinforcement of the separation of the Muslim population from the wider populous. As strong as the threatening practices of Muslims in descriptions of the counter jihad are images of a powerless Europe in decline and sliding into decadence, unable to resist Islamic takeover. The idea that European culture in particular is in a state of decline, while a spiritually vigorous East represented by Islam is in the ascendancy in civil society, is a common sentiment in some circles\".<ref name=\"Lee\" />\n\nTwo central counter-jihad themes have been identified: \n* the notion that Islam poses a threat to \"Western civilisation\", with a particular focus on \"Muslims living in Europe\", that is, within the European Counterjihad Movement (ECJM), \"seen predominantly in terms of immigration\",<ref name=Archer2013/> particularly Muslim immigration.<ref name=HitchensBrun2013/> \n* a lack of trust in regional, political and economic \"elites\", with a particular focus against the European Union (EU).<ref name=Archer2013>{{cite book|author1=Toby Archer|authorlink1=Breivik's Mindset|editor1-last=Taylor|editor1-first=Max|editor2-last=Currie|editor2-first=P.M.|editor3-last=Holbrook|editor3-first=Donald|title=Extreme right wing political violence and terrorism|date=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=London|isbn=9781441140876|pages=173\u20134|edition=1. publ.}}<!--|accessdate=23 May 2016--></ref>\n\n==Counter-jihad movement==\n[[File:Paulbelien.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Paul Beli\u00ebn, member of the board of directors of the International Free Press Society (IFPS) and the editor of Counterjihad blog The Brussels Journal]]\n\nOne of the first organizations of the Counter-jihad movement [CJM], the ''910 Group'' was founded in 2006 and announced on ''Gates of Vienna'', \"a principal blog of the CJM since 2004\".

The publicly stated goal of Islamic theology and political ideology is to impose the rule of Islam over the entire world, and make it part of Dar al-Islam, the 'House of Submission'.\"<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://gatesofvienna.blogspot.com/2009/11/counterjihad-manifesto.html|title=The Counterjihad Manifesto|first=Baron|last=Bodissey|date=20 November 2009|accessdate=28 August 2011|work=Gates of Vienna|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811154601/http://gatesofvienna.blogspot.com/2009/11/counterjihad-manifesto.html|archive-date=2011-08-11|url-status=live}}\n</ref></blockquote> [[Cas Mudde]] argues that various [[conspiracy theories]] with roots in [[Bat Ye'Or]]'s [[Eurabia]] are important to the movement.

In this process, the threat is characterized by the perceived removal of Christian or Jewish symbols, the imposition of Islamic traditions, and the creation of [[no-go area]]s for non-Muslims. The construction of [[mosques]] in particular is seen as continued reinforcement of the separation of the Muslim population from the wider populous. As strong as the threatening practices of Muslims in descriptions of the counter jihad are images of a powerless Europe in decline and sliding into decadence, unable to resist Islamic takeover. The idea that European culture in particular is in a state of decline, while a spiritually vigorous East represented by Islam is in the ascendancy in civil society, is a common sentiment in some circles\".<ref name=\"Lee\" />\n\nTwo central counter-jihad themes have been identified: \n* the notion that Islam poses a threat to \"Western civilisation\", with a particular focus on \"Muslims living in Europe\", that is, within the European Counterjihad Movement (ECJM), \"seen predominantly in terms of immigration\",<ref name=Archer2013/> particularly Muslim immigration.<ref name=HitchensBrun2013/> \n* a lack of trust in regional, political and economic \"elites\", with a particular focus against the European Union (EU).<ref name=Archer2013>{{cite book|author1=Toby Archer|authorlink1=Breivik's Mindset|editor1-last=Taylor|editor1-first=Max|editor2-last=Currie|editor2-first=P.M.|editor3-last=Holbrook|editor3-first=Donald|title=Extreme right wing political violence and terrorism|date=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=London|isbn=9781441140876|pages=173\u20134|edition=1. publ.}}<!--|accessdate=23 May 2016--></ref>\n\n==Counter-jihad movement==\n[[File:Paulbelien.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Paul Beli\u00ebn, member of the board of directors of the International Free Press Society (IFPS) and the editor of Counterjihad blog The Brussels Journal]]\n\nOne of the first organizations of the Counter-jihad movement [CJM], the ''910 Group'' was founded in 2006 and announced on ''Gates of Vienna'', \"a principal blog of the CJM since 2004\".

May]], writing under the [[pseudonym]] Baron Bodissey, the counter-jihadist movement is based on the belief that <blockquote>\"Islam is above all a totalitarian political ideology, sugar-coated with the trappings of a primitive desert religion to help veil its true nature. The publicly stated goal of Islamic theology and political ideology is to impose the rule of Islam over the entire world, and make it part of Dar al-Islam, the 'House of Submission'.\"<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://gatesofvienna.blogspot.com/2009/11/counterjihad-manifesto.html|title=The Counterjihad Manifesto|first=Baron|last=Bodissey|date=20 November 2009|accessdate=28 August 2011|work=Gates of Vienna|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811154601/http://gatesofvienna.blogspot.com/2009/11/counterjihad-manifesto.html|archive-date=2011-08-11|url-status=live}}\n</ref></blockquote> [[Cas Mudde]] argues that various [[conspiracy theories]] with roots in [[Bat Ye'Or]]'s [[Eurabia]] are important to the movement.

The American wing emphasizes an external threat, essentially terrorist in nature. The European wing sees a cultural threat to European traditions stemming from immigrant Muslim populations. While Archer notes that the perceived failure of multi-culturalism is shared across much of the political spectrum, he argues the counter-jihad movement is a particular conservative manifestation of this trend. He acknowledges the movement\u2019s conservative defense of human rights and the rule of law but he believes by rejecting progressive policy it rejects much of what Europe is today.<ref name=\"svd.se\"/>\n\nThe views of the counter-jihad movement have been criticized as a source of support for the anti-Muslim views of individuals inspired to take violent direct action.<ref name=tnyt2>\n{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/25/us/25debate.html?pagewanted=1&_r=3|title=Killings in Norway Spotlight Anti-Muslim Thought in U.S.|first=Scott|last=Shane|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=24 July 2011|accessdate=30 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116154910/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/25/us/25debate.html?_r=3&pagewanted=1|archive-date=2016-11-16|url-status=live}}\n</ref> [[Anders Behring Breivik]], responsible for the [[2011 Norway attacks]], published a manifesto explaining his views which drew heavily on the work of counter-jihad bloggers such as [[Fjordman]].<ref name=\"tnyt1\"/><ref name=\"dsp\">\n{{Cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,776413,00.html|title=Blogging Hate - Anders Breivik's Roots in Right-Wing Populism|first=Frank|last=Patalong|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|date=25 July 2011|accessdate=30 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110729094403/http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,776413,00.html|archive-date=2011-07-29|url-status=live}}\n</ref> [[Daniel Pipes]] argues that a \u201cclose reading of his manifesto suggests\u201d that Breivik wanted to discredit and undermine the movement's dedication to democratic change to further Breivik\u2019s \u201cdreamed-for revolution\u201d as the only alternative.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/272804/norway-s-terrorism-context-daniel-pipes|title=Norway's Terrorism in Context: The damage Behring Breivik did to the counterjihad may well have been purposeful|last=Pipes|first=Daniel|publisher=National Review Online|date=July 27, 2011|accessdate=April 24, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422095945/http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/272804/norway-s-terrorism-context-daniel-pipes|archive-date=2012-04-22|url-status=live}}\n</ref> [[Bruce Bawer]] argues that the association of criticism of Islam with violence implies that  \"to be opposed to jihad is, by definition, not only a bad but a downright dangerous thing.\"<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://frontpagemag.com/2012/04/20/the-scandalous-lies-of-hope-not-hate/|last=Bawer|first=Bruce|date=April 20, 2012|title=The Scandalous Lies of 'Hope Not Hate'|access-date=2012-04-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422113244/http://frontpagemag.com/2012/04/20/the-scandalous-lies-of-hope-not-hate/|archive-date=2012-04-22|url-status=dead}}\n</ref> Breivik has later identified himself as a [[Fascism|fascist]] and voiced support for [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazis]], stating that he had exploited counter-jihad rhetoric in order to protect \"[[Ethnic nationalism|ethno-nationalists]]\", and instead start a media drive against what he deemed \"anti-nationalist counterjihad\"-supporters.<ref name=\"Expo14\">\n{{Cite news|url=http://expo.se/2014/breivik-vill-deportera-illojala-judar_6336.html|title=Breivik vill deportera \"illojala judar\" [Breivik wants to deport \"disloyal Jews\"]|work=[[Expo (magazine)|Expo]]|date=10 January 2014|language=Swedish|author=Daniel Vergara|access-date=2015-07-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713231651/http://expo.se/2014/breivik-vill-deportera-illojala-judar_6336.html|archive-date=2015-07-13|url-status=live}}\n</ref><ref>\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/05/us-norway-breivik-idUSKBN0H01NG20140905 \"Mass killer Breivik says wants to create fascist party\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019190708/http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/05/us-norway-breivik-idUSKBN0H01NG20140905 |date=2015-10-19 }}.

They are possibly first mentioned locally by the [[Kylver Stone]] in the 4th century. [[Jordanes]], in the 6th century, mentions ''Suehans'' and ''Suetidi''. ''[[Beowulf]]'' mentions the Swedes around 1000 A.D. According to early sources such as the [[saga]]s, especially ''[[Heimskringla]]'', the Swedes were a powerful tribe whose kings claimed descendence from the god [[Freyr]]. During the [[Viking Age]] they constituted the basis of the [[Varangians|Varangian]] subset, the [[Norsemen]] that travelled eastwards (see [[Rus' people]]).\n\nThe scholarly consensus <ref>https://www.historyextra.com/period/viking/the-vikings-at-home/</ref> is that the Rus' people originated in what is currently coastal [[East Middle Sweden|eastern Sweden]] around the eighth century and that their name has the same origin as [[Roslagen]] in [[Sweden]] (with the older name being ''[[Roden, Sweden|Roden]]''). <ref>https://www.ancient.eu/Kievan_Rus/</ref> <ref>https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/vikg/hd_vikg.htm</ref> <ref>https://www.timetraveltours.se/blog/swedish-vikings-and-the-eastern-world/</ref> According to the prevalent theory, the name ''Rus''{{'}}, like the Proto-Finnic name for [[Sweden]] (''*Ruotsi''), is derived from an [[Old Norse]] term for \"the men who row\" (''rods-'') as rowing was the main method of navigating the rivers of Eastern Europe, and that it could be linked to the Swedish coastal area of [[Roslagen]] (''Rus-law'') or ''[[Roden, Sweden|Roden]]'', as it was known in earlier times.<ref name=\"Bl\u00f6ndal2007\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vFRug14ui7gC&pg=PA1|title=The Varangians of Byzantium|last=Bl\u00f6ndal|first=Sigf\u00fas|date=1978|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9780521035521|location=|page=1|pages=|accessdate=2 February 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">Stefan Brink, 'Who were the Vikings?', in ''[https://books.google.es/books?id=wuN-AgAAQBAJ The Viking World]'', ed. by Stefan Brink and Neil Price (Abingdon: Routledge, 2008), pp. 4-10 (pp. 6-7).</ref> The name ''Rus{{'}}'' would then have the same origin as the [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Estonian language|Estonian]] names for Sweden: ''Ruotsi''  and ''Rootsi''.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"etymonline.com\">\"Russ, adj. and n.\" OED Online, Oxford University Press, June 2018, www.oed.com/view/Entry/169069.

[[Swedish people|Swedish]] men left to enlist in the Byzantine Varangian Guard in such numbers that a medieval Swedish law, [[V\u00e4stg\u00f6talagen]], from [[V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland]] declared no one could inherit while staying in \"Greece\"\u2014the then Scandinavian term for the [[Byzantine Empire]]\u2014to stop the emigration,<ref>Jansson 1980:22</ref> especially as two other European courts simultaneously also recruited Scandinavians:<ref name=\"Pritsak386\">Pritsak 1981:386</ref> [[Kievan Rus']] c. 980\u20131060 and [[London]] 1018\u20131066 (the [[\u00deingali\u00f0]]).<ref name=\"Pritsak386\"/>\n\n==Name==\n{{Anchor|On the name}}\nAs the dominions of the Swedish kings grew, the name of the tribe could be applied more generally during the [[Middle Ages]] to include also the [[Geats]]. Later it again meant only the people inhabiting the original tribal lands in [[Svealand]], rather than the Geats.\n[[File:Pireuslejonet.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Piraeus Lion]] drawing of curved [[lindworm]]. The runes on the lion tell of [[Swedish people|Swedish]] warriors, most likely [[Varangians]], mercenaries in the service of the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Emperor.]]\n\nIn modern [[North Germanic languages]], the adjectival form ''svensk'' and its plural ''svenskar'' have replaced the name ''svear'' and is, today, used to denote all the citizens of [[Sweden]]. The distinction between the tribal Swedes (''svear'') and modern Swedes (''svenskar'') appears to have been in effect by the early 20th century, when ''[[Nordisk familjebok]]'' noted that ''svenskar'' had almost replaced ''svear'' as a name for the Swedish people.<ref>[http://runeberg.org/nfcg/0605.html The article ''Sverige'', ''spr\u00e5kv.'' in ''Nordisk familjebok'']</ref> Although this distinction is convention in modern Norwegian, Danish and Swedish, [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Faroese language|Faroese]] do not distinguish between ''sv\u00edar'' (Icelandic) or ''sviar'' (Faroese) and ''s\u00e6nskir'' (Icelandic) or ''svenskarar'' (Faroese) as words for modern Swedes.<ref>[http://www.fmn.fo/listar/lond_og_tjodir/lond-tjodir.htm#s The recommendations of the Council for the Faroese Language on nationality words]</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe form '''Suiones''' appears in the Roman author [[Tacitus]]'s ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]''. A closely similar form, ''Sweon(as)'', is found in [[Old English language|Old English]] and in the ''[[Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum]]'' of [[Adam of Bremen]] about the Hamburg-Bremen archbishops who are denoted ''Sueones''.\n\nMost scholars agree that ''Suiones'' and the attested Germanic forms of the name derive from the same [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] [[reflexive pronoun|reflexive pronominal]] root, {{PIE|*s(w)e}}, as the [[Latin]] ''suus''. The word must have meant \"one's own (tribesmen)\". In modern Scandinavian, the same root appears in words such as ''sv\u00e5ger'' (brother-in-law) and ''sv\u00e4gerska'' (sister-in-law). The same root and original meaning is found in the ethnonym of the Germanic tribe [[Suebi]], preserved to this day in the name ''Schwaben'' ([[Swabia]]).<ref name=\"pokorny\"/><ref name=\"Bandle, Oskar 2002. P.391\"/><ref>Noreen, A. ''Nordens \u00e4ldsta folk- och ortnamn'' (i Fornv\u00e4nnen 1920 sid 32).</ref><ref>[http://runeberg.org/svetym/1003.html Hellquist, Elof. 1922. Svensk etymologisk ordbok. Svear]</ref> The details of the phonetic development vary between different proposals.\n\nNor\u00e9en (1920) proposed that ''Suiones'' is a Latin rendering of [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] *''Swihoniz'', derived from the PIE root *swih- \"one's own\". The form *''Swihoniz'' would in [[Ulfilas]]' [[Gothic language|Gothic]] become *''Swa\u00edhans'', which later would result in the form ''Suehans'' that [[Jordanes]] mentioned as the name of the Swedes in ''[[Getica]]''. Consequently, the [[Proto-Norse language|Proto-Norse]] form would have been *''Swehaniz'' which following the sound-changes in Old Norse resulted in Old West Norse ''Sv\u00edar'' and Old East Norse ''Swear''. Currently, however, the root for \"one's own\" is reconstructed as {{PIE|*s(w)e}} rather than *swih, and that is the root identified for ''Suiones'' e.g. in Pokorny's 1959 ''[[Indogermanisches etymologisches W\u00f6rterbuch]]'' and in the 2002 ''The Nordic languages: an international handbook of the history of the North Germanic languages'' edited by Oskar Bandle. *''Swe'' is also the form cited by V. Friesen (1915), who regards the form Sviones as being originally an adjective, Proto-Germanic *''Sweoniz'', meaning \"kindred\". Then the Gothic form would have been *''Swians'' and the H in ''Suehans'' an [[epenthesis]]. The Proto-Norse form would then also have been *''Sweoniz'', which also would have resulted in the historically attested forms.\n[[File:Dr344 Runsten.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Simris Runestones#DR 344|Runestone DR 344]] is one of the earliest surviving instances of the name ''Sv\u00ed\u00fej\u00f3\u00f0'', in Scandinavia (only [[Simris Runestones#DR 216|Runestone DR 216]], ''[[Beowulf]]'' and probably also the ''[[Getica]]'' are earlier).]]\n\nThe name became part of a compound, which in Old West Norse was ''Sv\u00ed\u00fej\u00f3\u00f0'' (\"the Svear people'\", in Old East Norse ''Swe\u00feiu\u00f0'' and in Old English ''Sweo\u00f0eod''. This compound appears on [[runestone]]s in the locatives ''i sui\u00feiu\u00feu'' ([[Runestones at Aspa#S\u00f6 Fv1948;289|Runestone S\u00f6 Fv1948;289]], Aspa L\u00f6t, [[S\u00f6dermanland]]), ''a sui\u00feiu\u00feu'' ([[Simris Runestones#DR 344|Runestone DR 344]], Simris, [[Scania]]) and ''o suo\u00feiau\u00feu'' ([[Simris Runestones#DR 216|Runestone DR 216]], Tirsted, [[Lolland]]). The 13th century Danish source ''[[Scriptores rerum danicarum]]'' mentions a place called ''litl\u00e6 swethiuth\u00e6'', which is probably the islet ''Sverige'' (Sweden) in Saltsj\u00f6n in eastern Stockholm. 500 m west of the Islet Danmark.<ref>^ K\u00e4llg\u00e5rd, Anders (2005). Sveriges \u00f6ar. Carlssons bokf\u00f6rlag. sid. 359. {{ISBN|91-7203-465-3}}</ref> The earliest instance, however, appears to be ''Suetidi'' in [[Jordanes]]' ''[[Getica]]'' (6th century).\n\nThe only Germanic nation having a similar naming was the [[Goths]], who from the name *''Gutans'' (cf. ''Suehans'') created the form ''gut-\u00feiuda''.\n\nThe name ''Swethiuth'' and its different forms gave rise to the different Latin names for Sweden, ''Suethia'', ''Suetia'' and ''Suecia'' as well as the modern English name for the country.\n\nA second compound was ''Sv\u00edariki'', or ''Sweorice'' in Old English, which meant \"the realm of the Suiones\". This is still the formal name for Sweden in [[Swedish language|Swedish]], ''Svea rike'' and the origin of its current name ''Sverige'' with the \"k\" in the old form \"Sverike\" changed to a \"g\".\n\n==Location==\n[[File:Royal mounds.JPG|thumb|right|450px|[[Gamla Uppsala]] was the main religious and political centre of the tribe.]]\nTheir primary dwellings were in eastern [[Svealand]]. Their territories also very early included the provinces of [[V\u00e4stmanland]], [[S\u00f6dermanland]] and [[N\u00e4rke]] in the [[M\u00e4laren Valley]] which constituted a bay with a multitude of islands. The region is still one of the most fertile and densely populated regions of Scandinavia.\n\nTheir territories were called ''[[Svealand]]'' - \"Swede-land\" (\"The Voyage of [[Ohthere of H\u00e5logaland|Ohthere]]\" ''in'' ''Seven Books of History Against the Pagans'': ''Sw\u00e9oland''), ''Suithiod'' - \"Swede-people\" (''Beowulf'': ''Sweo\u00f0eod'' [hence [[Sweden]]]), ''Sv\u00eda[[realm|veldi]]'' or ''Svea[[reich|rike]]'' - \"Swede-realm\" (Beowulf: ''Sw\u00e9orice''). The political unification with the [[Geats]] in [[G\u00f6taland]], a process that was not complete until the 13th century, is by some contemporary historians regarded as the birth of the [[Sweden|Swedish kingdom]], although the Swedish kingdom is named after them, ''Sverige'' in [[Swedish language|Swedish]], from ''Svea rike'' - i.e. the kingdom of the Suiones.\n\nThe [[\u00c6sir]]-cult centre in [[Gamla Uppsala]], was the religious centre of the Swedes and where the Swedish king served as a priest during the sacrifices ([[bl\u00f3t]]s). Uppsala was also the centre of the [[Uppsala \u00f6d]], the network of royal estates that financed the Swedish king and his court until the 13th century.\n\nSome dispute whether the original domains of the Suiones really were in [[Gamla Uppsala|Uppsala]], the heartland of [[Uppland]], or if the term was used commonly for '''all''' tribes within Svealand, in the same way as old [[Norway]]'s different provinces were collectively referred to as ''Nortmanni''.\n\n==History==\nThe history of this tribe is shrouded in the mists of time. Besides [[Norse mythology]] and Germanic legend, only a few sources describe them and there is very little information.\n\n===Romans===\n[[File:Roman Empire 125.png|thumb|right|300px|The Roman empire under [[Hadrian]] (ruled 117-38), showing the location of the '''Suiones''' Germanic tribe, inhabiting central Sweden]]\n[[File:Gaius Cornelius Tacitus.jpg|thumb|Gaius Cornelius Tacitus]]\nThere are two sources from the 1st century A.D that are quoted as referring to the Suiones. The first one is [[Pliny the Elder]] who said that the Romans had rounded the ''Cimbric peninsula'' ([[Jutland]]) where there was the ''Codanian Gulf'' ([[Kattegat]]?). In this gulf there were several large islands among which the most famous was ''Scatinavia'' ([[Scandinavia]]). He said that the size of the island was unknown but in a part of it dwelt a tribe named the ''[[Hilleviones|Hillevionum gente]]'' ([[Nominative case|Nominative]]: ''Hillevionum gens''), in 500 villages, and they considered their country to be a world of its own.\n\nWhat strikes the commentators of this text is that this large tribe is unknown to posterity, unless it was a simple misspelling or misreading of ''Illa'' '''S'''''vionum gente''. This would make sense, since a large Scandinavian tribe named the ''Suiones'' was known to the Romans.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of European Peoples|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kfv6HKXErqAC&pg=PA786&lpg=PA786|publisher = Infobase Publishing|date = 2006-01-01|isbn = 9781438129181|language = en|first = Carl|last = Waldman|first2 = Catherine|last2 = Mason}}</ref>\n\nTacitus wrote in AD 98 in [[s:Germania#XLIV|Germania 44, 45]] that the Suiones were a powerful tribe (''distinguished not merely for their arms and men, but for their powerful fleets'') with ships that had a [[prow]] in both ends). He further mentions that the Suiones were much impressed by wealth, and the king's thus was absolute. Further, the Suiones did not normally bear arms, and that the weapons were guarded by a slave.\n\nAfter Tacitus' mention of the Suiones, the sources are silent about them until the 6th century as Scandinavia still was in pre-historic times. Some historians have maintained that it is not possible to claim that a continuous Swedish [[ethnicity]] reaches back to the Suiones of Tacitus.<ref>Dick Harrison: ''Sveriges historia - Medeltiden'' (2002); Fredrik Svanberg: ''Decolonizing the Viking Age'' (2003).</ref> According to this view the referent of an ethnonym and the ethnic discourse have varied considerably during different phases of history.\n\n===Jordanes===\n[[File:Vendel era helmet (942).jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Vendel Period]] helmet at the [[Swedish History Museum]].]]\nIn the 6th century [[Jordanes]] named two tribes he calls the '''Suehans''' and the '''Suetidi''' who lived in [[Scandza]]. They were famous for their fine horses. The Suehans were the suppliers of black fox skins for the Roman market. Then Jordanes names a tribe named '''Suetidi''' a name that is considered to refer to the Suiones as well and to be the Latin form of ''Swe\u00feiu\u00f0''. The Suetidi are said to be the tallest of men together with the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Dani]] who were of the same stock.\n\n===Anglo-Saxon sources===\nThere are three Anglo-Saxon sources that refer to the Swedes. The earliest one is probably the least known, since the mention is found in a long list of names of tribes and clans. It is the poem [[Widsith]] from the 6th or the 7th century:\n\n{|\n|\n:Wald Woingum, Wod \u00feyringum,\n:S\u00e6fer\u00f0 Sycgum, Sweom Ongend\u00feeow,\n:Sceafthere Ymbrum, Sceafa Longbeardum,\n|\n:Wald [ruled] the Woings, Wod the [[Thuringii|Thuringians]],\n:Saeferth the Sycgs, Ongendtheow the Swedes,\n:Sceafthere the Umbers, [[Sceafa]] the [[Lombards]],\n|\n|}\n[[File:Vendel era helmet (950).jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Vendel Period]] helmet at the [[Swedish History Museum]].]]\nOn line 32, [[Ongentheow]] is mentioned and he reappears in the later epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]'', which was composed sometime in the 8th-11th centuries. The poem describes [[Swedish-Geatish wars]], involving the Swedish kings [[Ongentheow]], [[Ohthere]], [[Onela]] and [[Eadgils]] who belonged to a royal dynasty called the ''[[Yngling|Scylfing]]s''. These kings might have been historical as kings with similar names appear in Scandinavian sources as well (see [[list of legendary kings of Sweden]]). There appears to be a prophecy by [[Wiglaf]] in the end of the epic of new wars with the Swedes:\n\n{|\n|\n:\u00de\u00e6t ys sio f\u00e6h\u00f0o      and se feond-scipe,\n:w\u00e6l-ni\u00f0 wera,      \u00fe\u00e6s \u00fee ic wen hafo,\n:\u00fee us secea\u00f0 to      Sweona leode,\n:sy\u00f0\u00f0an hie gefricgea\u00f0      frean userne\n:ealdor-leasne,      \u00feone \u00fee \u00e6r geheold\n:wi\u00f0 hettendum      hord and rice,\n:\u00e6fter h\u00e6le\u00f0a hryre      hwate Scylfingas,\n:folcred fremede      o\u00f0\u00f0e fur\u00f0ur gen\n:eorl-scipe efnde.<ref>Lines 3000-3008.</ref>\n|\n:Such is the feud, the foeman's rage,\n:death-hate of men:  so I deem it sure\n:that the Swedish folk will seek us home\n:for this fall of their friends, the fighting-[[Yngling|Scylfings]],\n:when once they learn that our warrior leader\n:lifeless lies, who land and hoard\n:ever defended from all his foes,\n:furthered his folk's weal, finished his course\n:a hardy hero.<ref>Gummere's translation</ref>\n|\n|}\n\nWhen more reliable historic sources appear the Geats are a subgroup of the Swedes.\n\nThe third Anglo-Saxon source is [[Alfred the Great]]'s translation of [[Orosius]]' ''Histories'', with appended tales of the voyages of [[Ohthere of H\u00e5logaland]] and [[Wulfstan of Hedeby]], who in the 9th century described the ''Sweon'' and ''Sweoland''.\n\nOhthere's account is limited to the following statement about Sw\u0113oland: \n:\u00d0onne is to\u0113mnes \u00f0\u01e3m lande s\u016b\u00f0eweardum, on \u014d\u00f0re healfe \u00f0\u00e6s m\u014dres, Sw\u0113oland, o\u00f0 \u00f0\u00e6t land nor\u00f0eweard; and to\u0113mnes \u00f0\u01e3m lande nor\u00f0eweardum, Cw\u0113na land.<ref name=uvic>[http://web.uvic.ca/hrd/iallt2003/oldenglish/OEparagraph-5.html Excerpt presented by the University of Victoria]</ref>\n\n:Then Sweden is along the land to the south, on the other side of the moors, as far as the land to the north; and (then) Finland (is) along the land to the north.<ref name=uvic/>\n\nWulfstan only mentions a few regions as being subject to the Sweons (in translation):\n:Then, after the [[Bornholm|land of the Burgundians]], we had on our left the lands that have been called from the earliest times [[Blekinge]]y, and [[M\u00f6re|Meore]], and [[\u00d6land|Eowland]], and [[Gotland]], all which territory is subject to the Sweons; and Weonodland was all the way on our right, as far as Weissel-mouth.<ref>[https://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4076 http://www.gutenberg.org]</ref>\n\n===Frankish sources===\nThe ''[[Annales Bertiniani]]'' relate that a group of [[Norsemen]], who called themselves ''[[Rus' people|Rhos]]'' visited [[Constantinople]] around the year 838. Fearful of returning home via the steppes, which would leave them vulnerable to attacks by the [[Hungarians]], the ''Rhos'' travelled through [[Germany]]. They were questioned by [[Louis the Pious]], Emperor of [[Francia]], somewhere near [[Mainz]]. They informed the emperor that their leader was known as ''chacanus'' (the [[Latin]] for \"[[khagan]]\") and that they lived in the north of Russia, but that they were '''Sueones'''.\n\n===Adam of Bremen===\nDealing with Scandinavian affairs, Adam of Bremen relates in the 11th century ''Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum'' that the '''Sueones''' had many wives and were severe on crime. Hospitality was an important virtue and refusing a wanderer to stay over the night was considered shameful. The visitor was even taken to see the hosts' friends.\n\nTheir royal family is of an old dynasty (see [[House of Muns\u00f6]]), but the kings are dependent on the will of the people (the [[Thing (assembly)|Thing]]). What has been decided by the people is more important than the will of the king unless the king's opinion seems to be the most reasonable one, whereupon they usually obey. During peacetime, they feel to be the king's equals but during wars they obey him blindly or whoever among them that he considers to be the most skillful. If the fortunes of war are against them they pray to one of their many gods ([[\u00c6sir]]) and if they win they are grateful to him.\n\n===Norse sagas===\nThe [[saga]]s are our foremost source for knowledge, and especially [[Snorri Sturluson]], who is probably the one who has contributed the most (see for instance the [[Heimskringla]]). His descriptions sometimes concur with, sometimes contradict the previous sources.\n\nFor a continuation, see [[History of Sweden (800\u20131521)]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Germanic culture}}\n* [[Mother Svea]]\n* [[Scandinavia]]\n* [[Vikings]]\n* [[Viking Age]]\n* [[Norsemen]]\n* [[Varangians]]\n* [[Geats]]\n* [[Gotlander]]\n* [[Goths]]\n* [[Danes (Germanic tribe)]]\n* [[Swedes]]\n* [[Danes]]\n* [[Norwegians]]\n* [[Trial by combat]]\n* [[Trial by ordeal]]\n* [[List of ancient Germanic peoples]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Tacitus, ''Germania'', [[wikisource:Germania#XLIV|XLIV]], [[wikisource:Germania#XLV|XLV]]''\n* Larsson, Mats G (2002).

They are possibly first mentioned locally by the [[Kylver Stone]] in the 4th century. [[Jordanes]], in the 6th century, mentions ''Suehans'' and ''Suetidi''. ''[[Beowulf]]'' mentions the Swedes around 1000 A.D. According to early sources such as the [[saga]]s, especially ''[[Heimskringla]]'', the Swedes were a powerful tribe whose kings claimed descendence from the god [[Freyr]]. During the [[Viking Age]] they constituted the basis of the [[Varangians|Varangian]] subset, the [[Norsemen]] that travelled eastwards (see [[Rus' people]]).\n\nThe scholarly consensus <ref>https://www.historyextra.com/period/viking/the-vikings-at-home/</ref> is that the Rus' people originated in what is currently coastal [[East Middle Sweden|eastern Sweden]] around the eighth century and that their name has the same origin as [[Roslagen]] in [[Sweden]] (with the older name being ''[[Roden, Sweden|Roden]]''). <ref>https://www.ancient.eu/Kievan_Rus/</ref> <ref>https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/vikg/hd_vikg.htm</ref> <ref>https://www.timetraveltours.se/blog/swedish-vikings-and-the-eastern-world/</ref> According to the prevalent theory, the name ''Rus''{{'}}, like the Proto-Finnic name for [[Sweden]] (''*Ruotsi''), is derived from an [[Old Norse]] term for \"the men who row\" (''rods-'') as rowing was the main method of navigating the rivers of Eastern Europe, and that it could be linked to the Swedish coastal area of [[Roslagen]] (''Rus-law'') or ''[[Roden, Sweden|Roden]]'', as it was known in earlier times.<ref name=\"Bl\u00f6ndal2007\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vFRug14ui7gC&pg=PA1|title=The Varangians of Byzantium|last=Bl\u00f6ndal|first=Sigf\u00fas|date=1978|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9780521035521|location=|page=1|pages=|accessdate=2 February 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">Stefan Brink, 'Who were the Vikings?', in ''[https://books.google.es/books?id=wuN-AgAAQBAJ The Viking World]'', ed. by Stefan Brink and Neil Price (Abingdon: Routledge, 2008), pp. 4-10 (pp. 6-7).</ref> The name ''Rus{{'}}'' would then have the same origin as the [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Estonian language|Estonian]] names for Sweden: ''Ruotsi''  and ''Rootsi''.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"etymonline.com\">\"Russ, adj. and n.\" OED Online, Oxford University Press, June 2018, www.oed.com/view/Entry/169069.

[[Swedish people|Swedish]] men left to enlist in the Byzantine Varangian Guard in such numbers that a medieval Swedish law, [[V\u00e4stg\u00f6talagen]], from [[V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland]] declared no one could inherit while staying in \"Greece\"\u2014the then Scandinavian term for the [[Byzantine Empire]]\u2014to stop the emigration,<ref>Jansson 1980:22</ref> especially as two other European courts simultaneously also recruited Scandinavians:<ref name=\"Pritsak386\">Pritsak 1981:386</ref> [[Kievan Rus']] c. 980\u20131060 and [[London]] 1018\u20131066 (the [[\u00deingali\u00f0]]).<ref name=\"Pritsak386\"/>\n\n==Name==\n{{Anchor|On the name}}\nAs the dominions of the Swedish kings grew, the name of the tribe could be applied more generally during the [[Middle Ages]] to include also the [[Geats]]. Later it again meant only the people inhabiting the original tribal lands in [[Svealand]], rather than the Geats.\n[[File:Pireuslejonet.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Piraeus Lion]] drawing of curved [[lindworm]]. The runes on the lion tell of [[Swedish people|Swedish]] warriors, most likely [[Varangians]], mercenaries in the service of the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Emperor.]]\n\nIn modern [[North Germanic languages]], the adjectival form ''svensk'' and its plural ''svenskar'' have replaced the name ''svear'' and is, today, used to denote all the citizens of [[Sweden]]. The distinction between the tribal Swedes (''svear'') and modern Swedes (''svenskar'') appears to have been in effect by the early 20th century, when ''[[Nordisk familjebok]]'' noted that ''svenskar'' had almost replaced ''svear'' as a name for the Swedish people.<ref>[http://runeberg.org/nfcg/0605.html The article ''Sverige'', ''spr\u00e5kv.'' in ''Nordisk familjebok'']</ref> Although this distinction is convention in modern Norwegian, Danish and Swedish, [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Faroese language|Faroese]] do not distinguish between ''sv\u00edar'' (Icelandic) or ''sviar'' (Faroese) and ''s\u00e6nskir'' (Icelandic) or ''svenskarar'' (Faroese) as words for modern Swedes.<ref>[http://www.fmn.fo/listar/lond_og_tjodir/lond-tjodir.htm#s The recommendations of the Council for the Faroese Language on nationality words]</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe form '''Suiones''' appears in the Roman author [[Tacitus]]'s ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]''. A closely similar form, ''Sweon(as)'', is found in [[Old English language|Old English]] and in the ''[[Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum]]'' of [[Adam of Bremen]] about the Hamburg-Bremen archbishops who are denoted ''Sueones''.\n\nMost scholars agree that ''Suiones'' and the attested Germanic forms of the name derive from the same [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] [[reflexive pronoun|reflexive pronominal]] root, {{PIE|*s(w)e}}, as the [[Latin]] ''suus''. The word must have meant \"one's own (tribesmen)\". In modern Scandinavian, the same root appears in words such as ''sv\u00e5ger'' (brother-in-law) and ''sv\u00e4gerska'' (sister-in-law). The same root and original meaning is found in the ethnonym of the Germanic tribe [[Suebi]], preserved to this day in the name ''Schwaben'' ([[Swabia]]).<ref name=\"pokorny\"/><ref name=\"Bandle, Oskar 2002.

Svear]</ref> The details of the phonetic development vary between different proposals.\n\nNor\u00e9en (1920) proposed that ''Suiones'' is a Latin rendering of [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] *''Swihoniz'', derived from the PIE root *swih- \"one's own\". The form *''Swihoniz'' would in [[Ulfilas]]' [[Gothic language|Gothic]] become *''Swa\u00edhans'', which later would result in the form ''Suehans'' that [[Jordanes]] mentioned as the name of the Swedes in ''[[Getica]]''. Consequently, the [[Proto-Norse language|Proto-Norse]] form would have been *''Swehaniz'' which following the sound-changes in Old Norse resulted in Old West Norse ''Sv\u00edar'' and Old East Norse ''Swear''. Currently, however, the root for \"one's own\" is reconstructed as {{PIE|*s(w)e}} rather than *swih, and that is the root identified for ''Suiones'' e.g. in Pokorny's 1959 ''[[Indogermanisches etymologisches W\u00f6rterbuch]]'' and in the 2002 ''The Nordic languages: an international handbook of the history of the North Germanic languages'' edited by Oskar Bandle. *''Swe'' is also the form cited by V. Friesen (1915), who regards the form Sviones as being originally an adjective, Proto-Germanic *''Sweoniz'', meaning \"kindred\". Then the Gothic form would have been *''Swians'' and the H in ''Suehans'' an [[epenthesis]]. The Proto-Norse form would then also have been *''Sweoniz'', which also would have resulted in the historically attested forms.\n[[File:Dr344 Runsten.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Simris Runestones#DR 344|Runestone DR 344]] is one of the earliest surviving instances of the name ''Sv\u00ed\u00fej\u00f3\u00f0'', in Scandinavia (only [[Simris Runestones#DR 216|Runestone DR 216]], ''[[Beowulf]]'' and probably also the ''[[Getica]]'' are earlier).]]\n\nThe name became part of a compound, which in Old West Norse was ''Sv\u00ed\u00fej\u00f3\u00f0'' (\"the Svear people'\", in Old East Norse ''Swe\u00feiu\u00f0'' and in Old English ''Sweo\u00f0eod''. This compound appears on [[runestone]]s in the locatives ''i sui\u00feiu\u00feu'' ([[Runestones at Aspa#S\u00f6 Fv1948;289|Runestone S\u00f6 Fv1948;289]], Aspa L\u00f6t, [[S\u00f6dermanland]]), ''a sui\u00feiu\u00feu'' ([[Simris Runestones#DR 344|Runestone DR 344]], Simris, [[Scania]]) and ''o suo\u00feiau\u00feu'' ([[Simris Runestones#DR 216|Runestone DR 216]], Tirsted, [[Lolland]]). The 13th century Danish source ''[[Scriptores rerum danicarum]]'' mentions a place called ''litl\u00e6 swethiuth\u00e6'', which is probably the islet ''Sverige'' (Sweden) in Saltsj\u00f6n in eastern Stockholm. 500 m west of the Islet Danmark.<ref>^ K\u00e4llg\u00e5rd, Anders (2005). Sveriges \u00f6ar. Carlssons bokf\u00f6rlag. sid. 359. {{ISBN|91-7203-465-3}}</ref> The earliest instance, however, appears to be ''Suetidi'' in [[Jordanes]]' ''[[Getica]]'' (6th century).\n\nThe only Germanic nation having a similar naming was the [[Goths]], who from the name *''Gutans'' (cf. ''Suehans'') created the form ''gut-\u00feiuda''.\n\nThe name ''Swethiuth'' and its different forms gave rise to the different Latin names for Sweden, ''Suethia'', ''Suetia'' and ''Suecia'' as well as the modern English name for the country.\n\nA second compound was ''Sv\u00edariki'', or ''Sweorice'' in Old English, which meant \"the realm of the Suiones\". This is still the formal name for Sweden in [[Swedish language|Swedish]], ''Svea rike'' and the origin of its current name ''Sverige'' with the \"k\" in the old form \"Sverike\" changed to a \"g\".\n\n==Location==\n[[File:Royal mounds.JPG|thumb|right|450px|[[Gamla Uppsala]] was the main religious and political centre of the tribe.]]\nTheir primary dwellings were in eastern [[Svealand]]. Their territories also very early included the provinces of [[V\u00e4stmanland]], [[S\u00f6dermanland]] and [[N\u00e4rke]] in the [[M\u00e4laren Valley]] which constituted a bay with a multitude of islands. The region is still one of the most fertile and densely populated regions of Scandinavia.\n\nTheir territories were called ''[[Svealand]]'' - \"Swede-land\" (\"The Voyage of [[Ohthere of H\u00e5logaland|Ohthere]]\" ''in'' ''Seven Books of History Against the Pagans'': ''Sw\u00e9oland''), ''Suithiod'' - \"Swede-people\" (''Beowulf'': ''Sweo\u00f0eod'' [hence [[Sweden]]]), ''Sv\u00eda[[realm|veldi]]'' or ''Svea[[reich|rike]]'' - \"Swede-realm\" (Beowulf: ''Sw\u00e9orice''). The political unification with the [[Geats]] in [[G\u00f6taland]], a process that was not complete until the 13th century, is by some contemporary historians regarded as the birth of the [[Sweden|Swedish kingdom]], although the Swedish kingdom is named after them, ''Sverige'' in [[Swedish language|Swedish]], from ''Svea rike'' - i.e. the kingdom of the Suiones.\n\nThe [[\u00c6sir]]-cult centre in [[Gamla Uppsala]], was the religious centre of the Swedes and where the Swedish king served as a priest during the sacrifices ([[bl\u00f3t]]s). Uppsala was also the centre of the [[Uppsala \u00f6d]], the network of royal estates that financed the Swedish king and his court until the 13th century.\n\nSome dispute whether the original domains of the Suiones really were in [[Gamla Uppsala|Uppsala]], the heartland of [[Uppland]], or if the term was used commonly for '''all''' tribes within Svealand, in the same way as old [[Norway]]'s different provinces were collectively referred to as ''Nortmanni''.\n\n==History==\nThe history of this tribe is shrouded in the mists of time. Besides [[Norse mythology]] and Germanic legend, only a few sources describe them and there is very little information.\n\n===Romans===\n[[File:Roman Empire 125.png|thumb|right|300px|The Roman empire under [[Hadrian]] (ruled 117-38), showing the location of the '''Suiones''' Germanic tribe, inhabiting central Sweden]]\n[[File:Gaius Cornelius Tacitus.jpg|thumb|Gaius Cornelius Tacitus]]\nThere are two sources from the 1st century A.D that are quoted as referring to the Suiones. The first one is [[Pliny the Elder]] who said that the Romans had rounded the ''Cimbric peninsula'' ([[Jutland]]) where there was the ''Codanian Gulf'' ([[Kattegat]]?). In this gulf there were several large islands among which the most famous was ''Scatinavia'' ([[Scandinavia]]). He said that the size of the island was unknown but in a part of it dwelt a tribe named the ''[[Hilleviones|Hillevionum gente]]'' ([[Nominative case|Nominative]]: ''Hillevionum gens''), in 500 villages, and they considered their country to be a world of its own.\n\nWhat strikes the commentators of this text is that this large tribe is unknown to posterity, unless it was a simple misspelling or misreading of ''Illa'' '''S'''''vionum gente''. This would make sense, since a large Scandinavian tribe named the ''Suiones'' was known to the Romans.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of European Peoples|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kfv6HKXErqAC&pg=PA786&lpg=PA786|publisher = Infobase Publishing|date = 2006-01-01|isbn = 9781438129181|language = en|first = Carl|last = Waldman|first2 = Catherine|last2 = Mason}}</ref>\n\nTacitus wrote in AD 98 in [[s:Germania#XLIV|Germania 44, 45]] that the Suiones were a powerful tribe (''distinguished not merely for their arms and men, but for their powerful fleets'') with ships that had a [[prow]] in both ends). He further mentions that the Suiones were much impressed by wealth, and the king's thus was absolute. Further, the Suiones did not normally bear arms, and that the weapons were guarded by a slave.\n\nAfter Tacitus' mention of the Suiones, the sources are silent about them until the 6th century as Scandinavia still was in pre-historic times. Some historians have maintained that it is not possible to claim that a continuous Swedish [[ethnicity]] reaches back to the Suiones of Tacitus.<ref>Dick Harrison: ''Sveriges historia - Medeltiden'' (2002); Fredrik Svanberg: ''Decolonizing the Viking Age'' (2003).</ref> According to this view the referent of an ethnonym and the ethnic discourse have varied considerably during different phases of history.\n\n===Jordanes===\n[[File:Vendel era helmet (942).jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Vendel Period]] helmet at the [[Swedish History Museum]].]]\nIn the 6th century [[Jordanes]] named two tribes he calls the '''Suehans''' and the '''Suetidi''' who lived in [[Scandza]]. They were famous for their fine horses. The Suehans were the suppliers of black fox skins for the Roman market. Then Jordanes names a tribe named '''Suetidi''' a name that is considered to refer to the Suiones as well and to be the Latin form of ''Swe\u00feiu\u00f0''. The Suetidi are said to be the tallest of men together with the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Dani]] who were of the same stock.\n\n===Anglo-Saxon sources===\nThere are three Anglo-Saxon sources that refer to the Swedes. The earliest one is probably the least known, since the mention is found in a long list of names of tribes and clans. It is the poem [[Widsith]] from the 6th or the 7th century:\n\n{|\n|\n:Wald Woingum, Wod \u00feyringum,\n:S\u00e6fer\u00f0 Sycgum, Sweom Ongend\u00feeow,\n:Sceafthere Ymbrum, Sceafa Longbeardum,\n|\n:Wald [ruled] the Woings, Wod the [[Thuringii|Thuringians]],\n:Saeferth the Sycgs, Ongendtheow the Swedes,\n:Sceafthere the Umbers, [[Sceafa]] the [[Lombards]],\n|\n|}\n[[File:Vendel era helmet (950).jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Vendel Period]] helmet at the [[Swedish History Museum]].]]\nOn line 32, [[Ongentheow]] is mentioned and he reappears in the later epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]'', which was composed sometime in the 8th-11th centuries. The poem describes [[Swedish-Geatish wars]], involving the Swedish kings [[Ongentheow]], [[Ohthere]], [[Onela]] and [[Eadgils]] who belonged to a royal dynasty called the ''[[Yngling|Scylfing]]s''. These kings might have been historical as kings with similar names appear in Scandinavian sources as well (see [[list of legendary kings of Sweden]]). There appears to be a prophecy by [[Wiglaf]] in the end of the epic of new wars with the Swedes:\n\n{|\n|\n:\u00de\u00e6t ys sio f\u00e6h\u00f0o      and se feond-scipe,\n:w\u00e6l-ni\u00f0 wera,      \u00fe\u00e6s \u00fee ic wen hafo,\n:\u00fee us secea\u00f0 to      Sweona leode,\n:sy\u00f0\u00f0an hie gefricgea\u00f0      frean userne\n:ealdor-leasne,      \u00feone \u00fee \u00e6r geheold\n:wi\u00f0 hettendum      hord and rice,\n:\u00e6fter h\u00e6le\u00f0a hryre      hwate Scylfingas,\n:folcred fremede      o\u00f0\u00f0e fur\u00f0ur gen\n:eorl-scipe efnde.<ref>Lines 3000-3008.</ref>\n|\n:Such is the feud, the foeman's rage,\n:death-hate of men:  so I deem it sure\n:that the Swedish folk will seek us home\n:for this fall of their friends, the fighting-[[Yngling|Scylfings]],\n:when once they learn that our warrior leader\n:lifeless lies, who land and hoard\n:ever defended from all his foes,\n:furthered his folk's weal, finished his course\n:a hardy hero.<ref>Gummere's translation</ref>\n|\n|}\n\nWhen more reliable historic sources appear the Geats are a subgroup of the Swedes.\n\nThe third Anglo-Saxon source is [[Alfred the Great]]'s translation of [[Orosius]]' ''Histories'', with appended tales of the voyages of [[Ohthere of H\u00e5logaland]] and [[Wulfstan of Hedeby]], who in the 9th century described the ''Sweon'' and ''Sweoland''.\n\nOhthere's account is limited to the following statement about Sw\u0113oland: \n:\u00d0onne is to\u0113mnes \u00f0\u01e3m lande s\u016b\u00f0eweardum, on \u014d\u00f0re healfe \u00f0\u00e6s m\u014dres, Sw\u0113oland, o\u00f0 \u00f0\u00e6t land nor\u00f0eweard; and to\u0113mnes \u00f0\u01e3m lande nor\u00f0eweardum, Cw\u0113na land.<ref name=uvic>[http://web.uvic.ca/hrd/iallt2003/oldenglish/OEparagraph-5.html Excerpt presented by the University of Victoria]</ref>\n\n:Then Sweden is along the land to the south, on the other side of the moors, as far as the land to the north; and (then) Finland (is) along the land to the north.<ref name=uvic/>\n\nWulfstan only mentions a few regions as being subject to the Sweons (in translation):\n:Then, after the [[Bornholm|land of the Burgundians]], we had on our left the lands that have been called from the earliest times [[Blekinge]]y, and [[M\u00f6re|Meore]], and [[\u00d6land|Eowland]], and [[Gotland]], all which territory is subject to the Sweons; and Weonodland was all the way on our right, as far as Weissel-mouth.<ref>[https://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4076 http://www.gutenberg.org]</ref>\n\n===Frankish sources===\nThe ''[[Annales Bertiniani]]'' relate that a group of [[Norsemen]], who called themselves ''[[Rus' people|Rhos]]'' visited [[Constantinople]] around the year 838. Fearful of returning home via the steppes, which would leave them vulnerable to attacks by the [[Hungarians]], the ''Rhos'' travelled through [[Germany]]. They were questioned by [[Louis the Pious]], Emperor of [[Francia]], somewhere near [[Mainz]]. They informed the emperor that their leader was known as ''chacanus'' (the [[Latin]] for \"[[khagan]]\") and that they lived in the north of Russia, but that they were '''Sueones'''.\n\n===Adam of Bremen===\nDealing with Scandinavian affairs, Adam of Bremen relates in the 11th century ''Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum'' that the '''Sueones''' had many wives and were severe on crime. Hospitality was an important virtue and refusing a wanderer to stay over the night was considered shameful. The visitor was even taken to see the hosts' friends.\n\nTheir royal family is of an old dynasty (see [[House of Muns\u00f6]]), but the kings are dependent on the will of the people (the [[Thing (assembly)|Thing]]). What has been decided by the people is more important than the will of the king unless the king's opinion seems to be the most reasonable one, whereupon they usually obey. During peacetime, they feel to be the king's equals but during wars they obey him blindly or whoever among them that he considers to be the most skillful. If the fortunes of war are against them they pray to one of their many gods ([[\u00c6sir]]) and if they win they are grateful to him.\n\n===Norse sagas===\nThe [[saga]]s are our foremost source for knowledge, and especially [[Snorri Sturluson]], who is probably the one who has contributed the most (see for instance the [[Heimskringla]]). His descriptions sometimes concur with, sometimes contradict the previous sources.\n\nFor a continuation, see [[History of Sweden (800\u20131521)]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Germanic culture}}\n* [[Mother Svea]]\n* [[Scandinavia]]\n* [[Vikings]]\n* [[Viking Age]]\n* [[Norsemen]]\n* [[Varangians]]\n* [[Geats]]\n* [[Gotlander]]\n* [[Goths]]\n* [[Danes (Germanic tribe)]]\n* [[Swedes]]\n* [[Danes]]\n* [[Norwegians]]\n* [[Trial by combat]]\n* [[Trial by ordeal]]\n* [[List of ancient Germanic peoples]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Tacitus, ''Germania'', [[wikisource:Germania#XLIV|XLIV]], [[wikisource:Germania#XLV|XLV]]''\n* Larsson, Mats G (2002).

This allowed who ever to hold the castle to tax not only traders, both those who were on pilgrimages to Mecca and Medina.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Milwright|first=Marcus|date=2006|title=Central and Southern Jordan in the Ayyubid Period: Historical and Archaeological Perspectives|jstor=25188591|journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society|volume=16|issue=1|pages=1\u201327}}</ref>  One of the major disadvantages of the site was an issue that the Crusaders encountered all over the Middle East, that issue is the lack of a reliable source of water. This problem was solved by the construction of a tunnel down the hill to two spring-fed cisterns. The tunnel allowed for defenders to go and retrieve water without exposing themselves to any attackers.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780521420686|title=Crusader castles|last=Kennedy)|first=Hugh|date=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521420687|location=Cambridge|oclc=28928501|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\nIt remained property of the royal family of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] until 1142, when it became part of the [[Lordship of Oultrejordain]]. At the same time the center of the Lordship was moved to [[Kerak]], a stronger fortress to the north of Montreal. Along with Kerak, the castle owed sixty knights to the kingdom. The first Lord of Oultrejordain was Philip of Nablus.<ref name=\":1\" /> It was held by [[Philip de Milly]], and then passed to [[Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon]] when he married [[Stephanie of Milly, Lady of Oultrejordain|Stephanie de Milly]]. Raynald used the castle to attack the rich caravans that had previously been allowed to pass unharmed. He also built ships there, then transported them overland to the Red Sea, planning to attack [[Mecca]] itself. This was intolerable to the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] sultan [[Saladin]], who invaded the kingdom in 1187.<ref>Edd\u00e9, Anne-Marie \"Saladin\" trans.

During the siege the defenders are said to have sold their wives and children for food, and to have gone blind from \"lack of salt.\" Because of the hill Saladin was unable to use [[siege engine]]s, but after almost two years the castle finally fell to his troops in May 1189, after which the defenders' families were returned to them.

As a result, the prototype, known as the '''\"Ko\u0161t\u011b\"''' (\"broom\"), was designed to chamber the intermediate Soviet [[7.62\u00d739mm|7.62\u00d739mm M43]] cartridge, rather than the Czech [[7.62\u00d745mm vz. 52]] round, used in both the earlier vz. 52 rifle and the [[Vz. 52 machine gun|vz. 52]] [[light machine gun]].<ref name=\"centvz58v\">{{citation|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQY/is_8_55/ai_n32097770/|title=Century's VZ.58V: and this one shoots!|author=Holt Bodinson|work=Guns Magazine|date=August 2009|access-date=2011-11-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624005000/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQY/is_8_55/ai_n32097770/|archive-date=2010-06-24|url-status=live}}</ref> The assault rifle entered service in 1958 and over a period of 25 years (until 1984), over 920,000 weapons had been produced, fielded by the armed forces of [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Cuba]] and several [[Asia]]n and [[Africa]]n nations.\n\nThe vz. 58 was produced in three main variants: the standard '''vz. 58 P''' (''P\u011bchotn\u00ed'' or \"infantry\") model with a fixed buttstock made of a synthetic material (wood impregnated plastic, older versions used a wooden stock), the '''vz. 58 V''' (''V\u00fdsadkov\u00fd''\u2014\"airborne\"), featuring a side-folding metal shoulder stock, folded to the right side, and the '''vz. 58 Pi''' (''P\u011bchotn\u00ed s infra\u010derven\u00fdm zam\u011b\u0159ova\u010dem''\u2014\"infantry with infrared sight\"), which is similar to the vz. 58 P but includes a receiver-mounted [[dovetail rail]] bracket (installed on the left side of the receiver) used to attach an NSP2 night sight; it also has a detachable folding [[bipod]] and an enlarged conical [[flash suppressor]].\n\nA successor to the vz. 58 was proposed in the 1990s; the [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] [[\u010cZ 2000]] assault rifle has been suggested as a possible replacement but due to a general lack of defense funds within the [[Czech Republic]], the program was postponed. Another recent contender is the \u010cZW-556 assault rifle and \u010cZW-762 light machine gun which both use lever-delayed blowback which has more reliable accuracy and performance over the gas operation. In 2011, the Czech army started replacing vz. 58 with [[CZ-805 BREN]]. While vz. 58 still remains the main assault rifle of the Slovak army, the Slovak army has also been eyeing CZ-805 as a possible replacement to the aging vz. 58 rifles.\n\n==Design details==\n{{refimprove section|date=May 2014}}\n\n===Operating mechanism===\n[[File:SA 58 FIELD STRIPPED.jpg|thumb|left|The vz. 58 field stripped]]\n[[File:Aktivni zalohy ACR.jpg|thumb|Members of Active Reserve of the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic armed with vz.58]]\n\nThe vz. 58 is a [[selective fire]] [[Gas-operated reloading|gas-operated]] weapon that bleeds expanding combustion gases generated in the [[gun barrel|barrel]] from the ignited cartridge through a port drilled in the barrel, {{convert|215|mm|abbr=on|1}} from the chamber, opening into a hollow cylinder located above the barrel that contains a short-stroke piston. The vz. 58 does not have a gas regulator and the full force of the gas pressure is exerted on the piston head, propelling it backwards in a single impulsive blow. The piston is driven back only {{convert|19|mm|abbr=on|1}} when a shoulder on the piston rod butts against the seating and no further movement is possible. There is a light return spring held between the piston shoulder and the seating which returns the piston to its forward position. The gas cylinder is vented after the piston has traveled back {{convert|16|mm|abbr=on|1}} and the remaining gases are exhausted into the atmosphere on the underside of the cylinder via two ports. The entire piston rod is [[Chrome plating|chromium-plated]] to prevent fouling.\n\nThe locking system features a  locking block  hinged from the bolt and housed in the bolt carrier that contains two locking lugs which descend into and engage locking shoulders in the [[receiver (firearms)|receiver]]'s internal guide rails. The weapon is unlocked by the short tappet-like stroke of the piston rod as it strikes the bolt carrier and drives it rearwards. After {{convert|22|mm|abbr=on|1}} of unrestricted travel, a wedge-like surface on the bolt carrier moves under the breech locking piece and lifts it up and out of engagement with the locking recesses in the [[steel]] body. The breech locking piece swings up and this movement provides the leverage required for [[primary extraction]]. The breech block is then carried rearwards extracting the empty [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]] casing from the chamber. A fixed ejector passes through a groove cut in the underside of the bolt and the case is flung upwards clear of the gun.\n\n===Features===\n[[File:Sa 58-JH02.jpg|thumb|right|vz. 58 P]]\n\nThe spring-loaded [[Extractor (firearms)|extractor]] and [[firing pin]] are both housed inside the bolt, while the fixed ejector is slotted inside the receiver. The extractor retains the firing pin and is powered by its own plunger and spring.\n\nThe weapon does not have a conventional rotating hammer but a linear hammer instead. The hammer is a steel cylinder hollowed from one end almost throughout its entire length to accommodate its own operating spring. At the open end of the cylinder, a plate is welded and a groove is cut in each side of this to slide on the receiver guide rails. This linear hammer enters the hollow bolt and drives a free-floating firing pin forward with each shot.<ref name=\"centvz58v\"/>\n\nThe vz.58 uses a [[Trigger (firearms)|trigger mechanism]] with a lever-type fire mode selector, which is also a manual [[Safety (firearms)|safety]] against accidental discharge. When the selector lever is placed in its rear position (\"1\"\u2014single fire) the sear is disabled and the left hammer catch is rotated by the disconnector, which is depressed by the bolt carrier after every shot and is therefore disconnected from the hammer catch. The forward setting of the selector lever (\"30\"\u2014automatic fire) disables the disconnector, and the left hammer catch meshes with the sear mechanism. The center (\"safe\") setting with the selector lever pointing vertically downwards, mechanically lowers the trigger bar and the disconnector so there is no connection between the trigger and the semi-automatic sear which holds the hammer. The rifle also has an internal safety, which prevents the weapon from discharging when out of battery. The right linear hammer catch disables it, and it can only be released by pulling the charging handle back and cocking the weapon.\n\nThe weapon is fed from a detachable [[box magazine]] with a 30-round cartridge capacity and made from a lightweight aluminium [[alloy]].<ref name=\"centvz58v\"/> When the last round from the magazine is fired, the bolt will remain locked open on the bolt catch, activated by the magazine's follower. The magazine release tab is located at the base of the receiver on the left side, behind the magazine well. The bolt carrier has a built-in guide rail used for reloading from 10-round stripper clips (from the [[SKS]] rifle). Despite their similarity, vz. 58 magazines are not interchangeable with those of the Kalashnikov-pattern weapons.\n\nAn interesting feature on this rifle is the ability to quickly change the type of stock. The vz. 58 can appear either with its original fixed stock (in either beech wood or composite material) or folding steel stock, or with one of the many aftermarket stocks available \u2013 including AR-15 style stock adapters that mount a buffer tube to the receiver. The latter usually has the buffer tube slightly angled down as to compensate for the very low ironsights on the vz. 58. Switching between the various options requires merely removal of a bolt at the rear of the receiver and swapping in the stock of choice.\n\n===Sights===\nThe rifle's [[iron sight]]s consist of a fully adjustable front post and a tangent rear sight with a sliding notch with range denominations from 100 to 800 m, graduated every 100 m. Besides this, the left side of the rear sight leaf is marked with the letter \"U\" (''univerz\u00e1ln\u00ed'' meaning \"universal\"), for snap shooting, firing at moving targets and night combat at ranges up to 300 m. The rifle's sight radius is {{convert|15|in|cm}}.<ref name=\"centvz58v\"/> The front sight base also serves as a mounting platform for the vz. 58 edged [[bayonet]].\n\n===Accessories===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Adam's Guns vz. 58 Accessories.jpg|thumb|right|The vz. 58 is issued with a four compartment leather pouch, magazines and bayonet with scabbard.]] -->\n\nSeveral modernization accessories have been manufactured for the vz. 58 platform from different companies.\nAccessories include \"tactical\" bolt release, extended and/or ambidextrous magazine release paddles, ambidextrous fire mode selectors, custom handguard rails, several types of sight mounting options and various muzzle brakes and compensators. Both civilian and military users use these upgrades, and they also see frequent use with private military companies in the Middle East.\n\nAdditional equipment supplied with the rifle includes: 4 spare magazines, a magazine pouch (in either canvas, leather, or leatherette), vz. 58 bayonet and scabbard, cleaning brush and rod, muzzle cap, oil bottle, unified sling, front sight adjustment tool, disassembly aid and a threaded [[blank-firing adaptor]]. The vz. 58 also has a proprietary bipod, flash hider and scope mount for NSP-2 night vision scope (vz.58 Pi variant). Grenade launching inserts, as well as under barrel grenade launchers were developed but never adopted.\n\n=== Legality in Canada ===\nIn Canada, the CZ 858 was sold with both standard-length and extended-length barrels as \"restricted\" and \"non-restricted\" rifles, respectively. In non-restricted form, the CZ 858 was popular as a hunting, camping, and wilderness self-defence rifle. With the passage of Bill C-71 in May 2019, most of these rifles were reclassified as \"prohibited\" and their use restricted to approved gun ranges. CZ 858 imports are no longer legal in Canada.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\nThat weapon was one of those intended to be used by the perpetrator of the [[Quebec City mosque shooting]] in 2017, but suffered a malfunction that probably limited the number of victims.\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Sa 58-JH04.jpg|right|thumb|The vz. 58 V model features a side-folding shoulder stock.

The Soviet Union had begun insisting that the [[Warsaw Pact]] forces standardize on a common ammunition. As a result, the prototype, known as the '''\"Ko\u0161t\u011b\"''' (\"broom\"), was designed to chamber the intermediate Soviet [[7.62\u00d739mm|7.62\u00d739mm M43]] cartridge, rather than the Czech [[7.62\u00d745mm vz. 52]] round, used in both the earlier vz. 52 rifle and the [[Vz. 52 machine gun|vz. 52]] [[light machine gun]].<ref name=\"centvz58v\">{{citation|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQY/is_8_55/ai_n32097770/|title=Century's VZ.58V: and this one shoots!|author=Holt Bodinson|work=Guns Magazine|date=August 2009|access-date=2011-11-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624005000/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQY/is_8_55/ai_n32097770/|archive-date=2010-06-24|url-status=live}}</ref> The assault rifle entered service in 1958 and over a period of 25 years (until 1984), over 920,000 weapons had been produced, fielded by the armed forces of [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Cuba]] and several [[Asia]]n and [[Africa]]n nations.\n\nThe vz. 58 was produced in three main variants: the standard '''vz. 58 P''' (''P\u011bchotn\u00ed'' or \"infantry\") model with a fixed buttstock made of a synthetic material (wood impregnated plastic, older versions used a wooden stock), the '''vz. 58 V''' (''V\u00fdsadkov\u00fd''\u2014\"airborne\"), featuring a side-folding metal shoulder stock, folded to the right side, and the '''vz. 58 Pi''' (''P\u011bchotn\u00ed s infra\u010derven\u00fdm zam\u011b\u0159ova\u010dem''\u2014\"infantry with infrared sight\"), which is similar to the vz. 58 P but includes a receiver-mounted [[dovetail rail]] bracket (installed on the left side of the receiver) used to attach an NSP2 night sight; it also has a detachable folding [[bipod]] and an enlarged conical [[flash suppressor]].\n\nA successor to the vz. 58 was proposed in the 1990s; the [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] [[\u010cZ 2000]] assault rifle has been suggested as a possible replacement but due to a general lack of defense funds within the [[Czech Republic]], the program was postponed. Another recent contender is the \u010cZW-556 assault rifle and \u010cZW-762 light machine gun which both use lever-delayed blowback which has more reliable accuracy and performance over the gas operation. In 2011, the Czech army started replacing vz. 58 with [[CZ-805 BREN]]. While vz. 58 still remains the main assault rifle of the Slovak army, the Slovak army has also been eyeing CZ-805 as a possible replacement to the aging vz. 58 rifles.\n\n==Design details==\n{{refimprove section|date=May 2014}}\n\n===Operating mechanism===\n[[File:SA 58 FIELD STRIPPED.jpg|thumb|left|The vz. 58 field stripped]]\n[[File:Aktivni zalohy ACR.jpg|thumb|Members of Active Reserve of the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic armed with vz.58]]\n\nThe vz. 58 is a [[selective fire]] [[Gas-operated reloading|gas-operated]] weapon that bleeds expanding combustion gases generated in the [[gun barrel|barrel]] from the ignited cartridge through a port drilled in the barrel, {{convert|215|mm|abbr=on|1}} from the chamber, opening into a hollow cylinder located above the barrel that contains a short-stroke piston. The vz. 58 does not have a gas regulator and the full force of the gas pressure is exerted on the piston head, propelling it backwards in a single impulsive blow. The piston is driven back only {{convert|19|mm|abbr=on|1}} when a shoulder on the piston rod butts against the seating and no further movement is possible. There is a light return spring held between the piston shoulder and the seating which returns the piston to its forward position. The gas cylinder is vented after the piston has traveled back {{convert|16|mm|abbr=on|1}} and the remaining gases are exhausted into the atmosphere on the underside of the cylinder via two ports. The entire piston rod is [[Chrome plating|chromium-plated]] to prevent fouling.\n\nThe locking system features a  locking block  hinged from the bolt and housed in the bolt carrier that contains two locking lugs which descend into and engage locking shoulders in the [[receiver (firearms)|receiver]]'s internal guide rails. The weapon is unlocked by the short tappet-like stroke of the piston rod as it strikes the bolt carrier and drives it rearwards. After {{convert|22|mm|abbr=on|1}} of unrestricted travel, a wedge-like surface on the bolt carrier moves under the breech locking piece and lifts it up and out of engagement with the locking recesses in the [[steel]] body. The breech locking piece swings up and this movement provides the leverage required for [[primary extraction]]. The breech block is then carried rearwards extracting the empty [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]] casing from the chamber. A fixed ejector passes through a groove cut in the underside of the bolt and the case is flung upwards clear of the gun.\n\n===Features===\n[[File:Sa 58-JH02.jpg|thumb|right|vz. 58 P]]\n\nThe spring-loaded [[Extractor (firearms)|extractor]] and [[firing pin]] are both housed inside the bolt, while the fixed ejector is slotted inside the receiver. The extractor retains the firing pin and is powered by its own plunger and spring.\n\nThe weapon does not have a conventional rotating hammer but a linear hammer instead. The hammer is a steel cylinder hollowed from one end almost throughout its entire length to accommodate its own operating spring. At the open end of the cylinder, a plate is welded and a groove is cut in each side of this to slide on the receiver guide rails. This linear hammer enters the hollow bolt and drives a free-floating firing pin forward with each shot.<ref name=\"centvz58v\"/>\n\nThe vz.58 uses a [[Trigger (firearms)|trigger mechanism]] with a lever-type fire mode selector, which is also a manual [[Safety (firearms)|safety]] against accidental discharge. When the selector lever is placed in its rear position (\"1\"\u2014single fire) the sear is disabled and the left hammer catch is rotated by the disconnector, which is depressed by the bolt carrier after every shot and is therefore disconnected from the hammer catch. The forward setting of the selector lever (\"30\"\u2014automatic fire) disables the disconnector, and the left hammer catch meshes with the sear mechanism. The center (\"safe\") setting with the selector lever pointing vertically downwards, mechanically lowers the trigger bar and the disconnector so there is no connection between the trigger and the semi-automatic sear which holds the hammer. The rifle also has an internal safety, which prevents the weapon from discharging when out of battery. The right linear hammer catch disables it, and it can only be released by pulling the charging handle back and cocking the weapon.\n\nThe weapon is fed from a detachable [[box magazine]] with a 30-round cartridge capacity and made from a lightweight aluminium [[alloy]].<ref name=\"centvz58v\"/> When the last round from the magazine is fired, the bolt will remain locked open on the bolt catch, activated by the magazine's follower. The magazine release tab is located at the base of the receiver on the left side, behind the magazine well. The bolt carrier has a built-in guide rail used for reloading from 10-round stripper clips (from the [[SKS]] rifle). Despite their similarity, vz. 58 magazines are not interchangeable with those of the Kalashnikov-pattern weapons.\n\nAn interesting feature on this rifle is the ability to quickly change the type of stock. The vz. 58 can appear either with its original fixed stock (in either beech wood or composite material) or folding steel stock, or with one of the many aftermarket stocks available \u2013 including AR-15 style stock adapters that mount a buffer tube to the receiver. The latter usually has the buffer tube slightly angled down as to compensate for the very low ironsights on the vz. 58. Switching between the various options requires merely removal of a bolt at the rear of the receiver and swapping in the stock of choice.\n\n===Sights===\nThe rifle's [[iron sight]]s consist of a fully adjustable front post and a tangent rear sight with a sliding notch with range denominations from 100 to 800 m, graduated every 100 m. Besides this, the left side of the rear sight leaf is marked with the letter \"U\" (''univerz\u00e1ln\u00ed'' meaning \"universal\"), for snap shooting, firing at moving targets and night combat at ranges up to 300 m. The rifle's sight radius is {{convert|15|in|cm}}.<ref name=\"centvz58v\"/> The front sight base also serves as a mounting platform for the vz. 58 edged [[bayonet]].\n\n===Accessories===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Adam's Guns vz. 58 Accessories.jpg|thumb|right|The vz. 58 is issued with a four compartment leather pouch, magazines and bayonet with scabbard.]] -->\n\nSeveral modernization accessories have been manufactured for the vz. 58 platform from different companies.\nAccessories include \"tactical\" bolt release, extended and/or ambidextrous magazine release paddles, ambidextrous fire mode selectors, custom handguard rails, several types of sight mounting options and various muzzle brakes and compensators. Both civilian and military users use these upgrades, and they also see frequent use with private military companies in the Middle East.\n\nAdditional equipment supplied with the rifle includes: 4 spare magazines, a magazine pouch (in either canvas, leather, or leatherette), vz. 58 bayonet and scabbard, cleaning brush and rod, muzzle cap, oil bottle, unified sling, front sight adjustment tool, disassembly aid and a threaded [[blank-firing adaptor]]. The vz. 58 also has a proprietary bipod, flash hider and scope mount for NSP-2 night vision scope (vz.58 Pi variant). Grenade launching inserts, as well as under barrel grenade launchers were developed but never adopted.\n\n=== Legality in Canada ===\nIn Canada, the CZ 858 was sold with both standard-length and extended-length barrels as \"restricted\" and \"non-restricted\" rifles, respectively. In non-restricted form, the CZ 858 was popular as a hunting, camping, and wilderness self-defence rifle. With the passage of Bill C-71 in May 2019, most of these rifles were reclassified as \"prohibited\" and their use restricted to approved gun ranges. CZ 858 imports are no longer legal in Canada.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\nThat weapon was one of those intended to be used by the perpetrator of the [[Quebec City mosque shooting]] in 2017, but suffered a malfunction that probably limited the number of victims.\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Sa 58-JH04.jpg|right|thumb|The vz. 58 V model features a side-folding shoulder stock.

Sosialistisk Studenlag opposed this and as an attempt to prevent West Germany from getting access to nuclear weapons it contacted MPs during the Easter break to sign a petition. More than half of Labour\u2019s MPs signed in what is known as the Easter Rebellion of the Labour Party. The rebellion was badly received by the party leadership when the Easter break ended. Several people were excluded from the Labour Party, including the members of Sosialistisk Studentlag.

Sosialistisk Studenlag opposed this and as an attempt to prevent West Germany from getting access to nuclear weapons it contacted MPs during the Easter break to sign a petition. More than half of Labour\u2019s MPs signed in what is known as the Easter Rebellion of the Labour Party. The rebellion was badly received by the party leadership when the Easter break ended.

[[Damascus]] in [[Syria]]. It is the home of [[Our Lady of Saidnaya Monastery|a Greek Orthodox monastery]] traditionally held to have been founded by [[Byzantine]] emperor [[Justinian I]], and where a renowned icon of the [[Virgin Mary]] is revered by both Christians and Muslims to this day. The town is noted for the large number of (Western Neo-) [[Aramaic]] speakers, along with nearby [[Maaloula]] and few smaller towns nearby such as [[Maarat Saidnaya]]. According to the [[Central Bureau of Statistics (Syria)|Syria Central Bureau of Statistics]] (CBS), Saidnaya had a population of 25,194 in the 2004 census.<ref name=\"CBS\">[http://www.cbssyr.org/new%20web%20site/General_census/census_2004/NH/TAB03-20-2004.htm General Census of Population and Housing 2004]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

Rif Dimashq Governorate. {{in lang|ar}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n<blockquote>Local tradition holds that Saydnaya means \u2018Halting-place of the gazelle\u2019.  The place-name has also been thought to mean Our Lady the New, from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''nea'', \u2018new\u2019, and the [[Arabic]] ''sayyida'', \u2018lady\u2019. However, the word ''sayd'' is generally related to hunting, and ''naya'' is a typical place-suffix in [[Syriac language|Syriac]]; therefore, Saydnaya probably means simply a hunting-place. Indeed, in ancient times, a temple of Saydoun, the [[Phoenicia]]n god of the hunt, stood in this once densely forested region. Under later Christian and Arabic influence, perhaps the name may have been thought to mean the \u2018place of the Lady\u2019.<ref>[https://antiochpatriarchate.org/en/page/our-lady-of-saydnaya-patriarchal-monastery/146/ Our Lady of Saydnaya Patriarchal Monastery] (''antiochpatriarchate.org'').</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe [[Hellenistic-era]] name for the region centered in the Barada Valley was [[Abilene (biblical)|Abilene]]: the local tradition has thus long held it as the site where the grave of [[Abel]], slain brother of Cain, lies.  Scholars consider it likely that the capital of Abilene was the city of Saidnaya.<ref name=\"Vasilak\u0113\">Vasilak\u0113, 2005, p. 278.</ref><ref name=Garrettp2>Garrett, 2007, p. 2-4.</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nLong a center of [[Christians|Christian]] pilgrimage, pilgrims from all over the world seek Saidnaya for renewal of faith and for healing.<ref name=Garrettp2/> Renowned for its faithfulness to [[Christianity]], tradition holds that the [[Convent of Our Lady of Saidnaya]] was constructed by the [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine emperor]] [[Justinian I]] in 547 AD, after he had two visions of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], one that indicated where to build the church and the other outlining its design.<ref name=Garrettp2/> Justinian dedicated the finished project to the feast of [[Nativity of Mary|Mary's Nativity]], and annually thereafter on September 8, and through to the present day, both [[Islam|Muslim]] and Christian pilgrims have come to commemorate the feast day of ''Our Lady of Saidnaya''.<ref name=Garrettp2/><ref name=Mannheimp138>Mannheim, 2001, p. 138.</ref> Also located in the convent of Saidnaya is an [[icon]] of the Holy Mother and Child known as the ''Shaghurah'' and reputed to have been painted by [[Luke the Evangelist]] which is believed to protect its owners from harm in times of danger.<ref name=Garrettp2/>\n\nDue in no small measure to its protected mountainous location, Saidnaya enjoyed religious peace throughout its history, even during times of war, such as during the [[Crusades]].<ref name=Garrettp2/> Local Muslims visit the convent sanctuary on the day of Friday prayers and share in the legends regarding this holy place.<ref name=Garrettp2/> Christians and Muslims from the region and from far away places seek the shrine for healing.<ref name=Waddyp223>Waddy, 1980, p. 223.</ref> Numerous accounts of [[miracle|miraculous]] healings have been reported, some which are documented in writing by those who experienced them throughout history.<ref name=Pringle>Pringle, 1993, pp. 219-220.</ref>\n\nMany other [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Syriac Catholic Church|Syriac Catholic]] and [[Syriac Orthodox]] churches and monasteries have been built in Saidnaya throughout history. On top of the highest mountain in Saidnaya is the Cherubim Monastery at 2,000 metres (6,561.68 feet) above sea level, overlooking Damascus' fertile plains and [[Lebanon]]'s mountains. There is also the Monastery of Mar Thomas and a few massive monasteries built more recently such as St. Thomas Creek Catholic Monastery, St. Estphariuos Orthodox Monastery, and St. Ephram Syriac Monastery. A bronze [[Statue of Jesus (Saidnaya)|statue of Jesus Christ]] with 33.10 m high, was installed on 14 October 2013 financed by both the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and the Russian government, The statue is near the Monastery of the Cherubim, perched above the historic pilgrimage route from [[Constantinople]] to [[Jerusalem]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Muscovite Builds Record-Breaking Jesus Statue in Syria |url=https://themoscowtimes.com/articles/muscovite-builds-record-breaking-jesus-statue-in-syria-28831 |website=themoscowtimes.com |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe weather is cold and snowy in winter, while it is warm and has fresh air in summer. Surviving vestiges of caves, grottos and ancient places in and around Saydnaya indicate that it was inhabited by different civilizations from the early [[Stone Age]], with artifacts from [[Aramaic]], [[Ancient Greece|Greek]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], and [[Arab]] times.<ref name=Mannheim>Mannheim, 2001, pp. 136-137.</ref>\n\n==History==\nSaidnaya's origins are in ancient times, and the town has been inhabited since at least the sixth century BC when it was known by its [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] name, ''Danaba''.<ref name=Mannheim/> It emerged as an important center of Christianity well before it was adopted as the official religion of the [[Roman empire]].<ref name=Mannheim/> Macarius, the first bishop of [[Aleppo]] and later the Patriarch of [[Antioch]], lists Saidnaya in a seventeenth-century [[Arabic language|Arabic]] manuscript as one of the seven ancient episcopal cities under Damascus, the same cities represented at the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 AD.<ref name=Pitardp150>Pitard, 1987, p. 150.</ref><ref name=Porter>Porter, 1855, p. 107.</ref>\n\n===The Icon of the All-Holy Virgin===\n[[File:Syria283.jpg|thumb|right|The Convent of Our Lady of Saidnaya]]\nIn the late 8th century, a certain venerable Marina was abbess of the convent, and she was widely revered for her piety and sanctity of life. It happened that a hermit monk, a Greek pilgrim from Egypt named Theodore, stopped at the convent on his way to the Holy Land. When he was leaving, Abbess Marina asked him to buy in Jerusalem a precious and fine icon of the Holy Virgin. While at Jerusalem, he utterly forgot the task entrusted to him and started on his return journey. However, when he had not gone far from the city, he was stopped short by an unfamiliar voice: \"Have you not forgotten something in Jerusalem? What have you done in regard to the commission from Abbess Marina?\" Monk Theodore returned at once to Jerusalem and found an icon of the [[Theotokos]]. During the journey back to the convent, he was astounded by the miracles accomplished through the icon. He and his whole caravan were ambushed by bandits, and then attacked by wild beasts. Amidst these dangers, the hermit always invoked the aid of the Holy Virgin while holding her icon, and he and all the caravan were saved from every peril.\n\nWhen Theodore returned to the convent, these events tempted him to keep the valuable icon for himself, and he decided to bypass Saidnaya and sail back to Egypt. However, he was unable to set sail, for such a fierce storm arose, it seemed the ship would inevitably sink. His conscience was pricked, and he quickly left the ship and returned by way of Saidnaya. After spending four days in the convent, he was again possessed by an irresistible desire to make the icon of the Mother of God his own. He apologized to the abbess, pretending that he had been unable to buy the required icon, and then he decided to leave the convent secretly. The next morning, as he was about to set out on the journey back to his own country and approached the convent gate, he was amazed to find that an invisible power barred his way, and it was as though a stone wall stood where the gate should have been. After many futile attempts, he was forced to hand the icon over to the abbess, confessing his intention. With tears of gratitude she glorified the Lord and His All-pure Mother. Today the holy Icon is visited by pilgrims seeking the Virgin Mary's blessings as it is believed to grant (or at least intercede for) healing and fertility miracles. It is notable that Syrian Muslims often visit and pray before the Icon as well.<ref>{{Citation |last=Belt |first=Don |title=The Forgotten Faithful|journal=National Geographic |volume=215|issue=6 |date=June 2009 |page=93 |postscript=.}}</ref>\n\n===Construction of the Convent===\nAccording to the tradition, [[Justinian I|emperor Justinian I]], while crossing Syria with his troops either on his way to the Holy Land or on a campaign against the Persians, came to this desert, where his army encamped and soon suffered thirst for lack of water. When they despaired, the emperor saw a beautiful gazelle off in the distance. He vigorously gave chase, hunting the animal until it tired and stopped on a rocky knoll and approached a spring of fresh water, but without giving the emperor the opportunity to shoot it. Suddenly, it transformed into an icon of the  [[Theotokos]], which shone with a brilliant light. A white hand stretched forth from it and a voice said, \"No, thou shalt not kill me, Justinian, but thou shalt build a church for me here on this hill.\" Then the strange heavenly light and majestic figure disappeared. Upon his return, Justinian related what he had seen to his subordinates and ordered them immediately to draw up a plan for the contemplated church. After some time had passed and the architects were unable to resolve the problems of the plan, the Holy Virgin \u2014 the gazelle \u2014 reappeared to Justinian in a dream and confided a magnificent plan to him for a convent, of which she would be the protectress. It is said that the basic structure of the convent follows this plan to this day. The convent soon gained such renown that it came to be ranked second only to Jerusalem as a place of pilgrimage, and nuns from every corner of Syria, Egypt, and other lands flocked to it.

mountains, {{cvt|1500|m}} above sea level, {{cvt|27|km|mi}} north of the city of [[Damascus]] in [[Syria]]. It is the home of [[Our Lady of Saidnaya Monastery|a Greek Orthodox monastery]] traditionally held to have been founded by [[Byzantine]] emperor [[Justinian I]], and where a renowned icon of the [[Virgin Mary]] is revered by both Christians and Muslims to this day. The town is noted for the large number of (Western Neo-) [[Aramaic]] speakers, along with nearby [[Maaloula]] and few smaller towns nearby such as [[Maarat Saidnaya]]. According to the [[Central Bureau of Statistics (Syria)|Syria Central Bureau of Statistics]] (CBS), Saidnaya had a population of 25,194 in the 2004 census.<ref name=\"CBS\">[http://www.cbssyr.org/new%20web%20site/General_census/census_2004/NH/TAB03-20-2004.htm General Census of Population and Housing 2004]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

Rif Dimashq Governorate. {{in lang|ar}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n<blockquote>Local tradition holds that Saydnaya means \u2018Halting-place of the gazelle\u2019.  The place-name has also been thought to mean Our Lady the New, from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''nea'', \u2018new\u2019, and the [[Arabic]] ''sayyida'', \u2018lady\u2019. However, the word ''sayd'' is generally related to hunting, and ''naya'' is a typical place-suffix in [[Syriac language|Syriac]]; therefore, Saydnaya probably means simply a hunting-place. Indeed, in ancient times, a temple of Saydoun, the [[Phoenicia]]n god of the hunt, stood in this once densely forested region. Under later Christian and Arabic influence, perhaps the name may have been thought to mean the \u2018place of the Lady\u2019.<ref>[https://antiochpatriarchate.org/en/page/our-lady-of-saydnaya-patriarchal-monastery/146/ Our Lady of Saydnaya Patriarchal Monastery] (''antiochpatriarchate.org'').</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe [[Hellenistic-era]] name for the region centered in the Barada Valley was [[Abilene (biblical)|Abilene]]: the local tradition has thus long held it as the site where the grave of [[Abel]], slain brother of Cain, lies.  Scholars consider it likely that the capital of Abilene was the city of Saidnaya.<ref name=\"Vasilak\u0113\">Vasilak\u0113, 2005, p. 278.</ref><ref name=Garrettp2>Garrett, 2007, p. 2-4.</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nLong a center of [[Christians|Christian]] pilgrimage, pilgrims from all over the world seek Saidnaya for renewal of faith and for healing.<ref name=Garrettp2/> Renowned for its faithfulness to [[Christianity]], tradition holds that the [[Convent of Our Lady of Saidnaya]] was constructed by the [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine emperor]] [[Justinian I]] in 547 AD, after he had two visions of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], one that indicated where to build the church and the other outlining its design.<ref name=Garrettp2/> Justinian dedicated the finished project to the feast of [[Nativity of Mary|Mary's Nativity]], and annually thereafter on September 8, and through to the present day, both [[Islam|Muslim]] and Christian pilgrims have come to commemorate the feast day of ''Our Lady of Saidnaya''.<ref name=Garrettp2/><ref name=Mannheimp138>Mannheim, 2001, p. 138.</ref> Also located in the convent of Saidnaya is an [[icon]] of the Holy Mother and Child known as the ''Shaghurah'' and reputed to have been painted by [[Luke the Evangelist]] which is believed to protect its owners from harm in times of danger.<ref name=Garrettp2/>\n\nDue in no small measure to its protected mountainous location, Saidnaya enjoyed religious peace throughout its history, even during times of war, such as during the [[Crusades]].<ref name=Garrettp2/> Local Muslims visit the convent sanctuary on the day of Friday prayers and share in the legends regarding this holy place.<ref name=Garrettp2/> Christians and Muslims from the region and from far away places seek the shrine for healing.<ref name=Waddyp223>Waddy, 1980, p. 223.</ref> Numerous accounts of [[miracle|miraculous]] healings have been reported, some which are documented in writing by those who experienced them throughout history.<ref name=Pringle>Pringle, 1993, pp. 219-220.</ref>\n\nMany other [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Syriac Catholic Church|Syriac Catholic]] and [[Syriac Orthodox]] churches and monasteries have been built in Saidnaya throughout history. On top of the highest mountain in Saidnaya is the Cherubim Monastery at 2,000 metres (6,561.68 feet) above sea level, overlooking Damascus' fertile plains and [[Lebanon]]'s mountains. There is also the Monastery of Mar Thomas and a few massive monasteries built more recently such as St. Thomas Creek Catholic Monastery, St. Estphariuos Orthodox Monastery, and St. Ephram Syriac Monastery. A bronze [[Statue of Jesus (Saidnaya)|statue of Jesus Christ]] with 33.10 m high, was installed on 14 October 2013 financed by both the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and the Russian government, The statue is near the Monastery of the Cherubim, perched above the historic pilgrimage route from [[Constantinople]] to [[Jerusalem]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Muscovite Builds Record-Breaking Jesus Statue in Syria |url=https://themoscowtimes.com/articles/muscovite-builds-record-breaking-jesus-statue-in-syria-28831 |website=themoscowtimes.com |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe weather is cold and snowy in winter, while it is warm and has fresh air in summer. Surviving vestiges of caves, grottos and ancient places in and around Saydnaya indicate that it was inhabited by different civilizations from the early [[Stone Age]], with artifacts from [[Aramaic]], [[Ancient Greece|Greek]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], and [[Arab]] times.<ref name=Mannheim>Mannheim, 2001, pp. 136-137.</ref>\n\n==History==\nSaidnaya's origins are in ancient times, and the town has been inhabited since at least the sixth century BC when it was known by its [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] name, ''Danaba''.<ref name=Mannheim/> It emerged as an important center of Christianity well before it was adopted as the official religion of the [[Roman empire]].<ref name=Mannheim/> Macarius, the first bishop of [[Aleppo]] and later the Patriarch of [[Antioch]], lists Saidnaya in a seventeenth-century [[Arabic language|Arabic]] manuscript as one of the seven ancient episcopal cities under Damascus, the same cities represented at the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 AD.<ref name=Pitardp150>Pitard, 1987, p. 150.</ref><ref name=Porter>Porter, 1855, p. 107.</ref>\n\n===The Icon of the All-Holy Virgin===\n[[File:Syria283.jpg|thumb|right|The Convent of Our Lady of Saidnaya]]\nIn the late 8th century, a certain venerable Marina was abbess of the convent, and she was widely revered for her piety and sanctity of life. It happened that a hermit monk, a Greek pilgrim from Egypt named Theodore, stopped at the convent on his way to the Holy Land. When he was leaving, Abbess Marina asked him to buy in Jerusalem a precious and fine icon of the Holy Virgin. While at Jerusalem, he utterly forgot the task entrusted to him and started on his return journey. However, when he had not gone far from the city, he was stopped short by an unfamiliar voice: \"Have you not forgotten something in Jerusalem? What have you done in regard to the commission from Abbess Marina?\" Monk Theodore returned at once to Jerusalem and found an icon of the [[Theotokos]]. During the journey back to the convent, he was astounded by the miracles accomplished through the icon. He and his whole caravan were ambushed by bandits, and then attacked by wild beasts. Amidst these dangers, the hermit always invoked the aid of the Holy Virgin while holding her icon, and he and all the caravan were saved from every peril.\n\nWhen Theodore returned to the convent, these events tempted him to keep the valuable icon for himself, and he decided to bypass Saidnaya and sail back to Egypt. However, he was unable to set sail, for such a fierce storm arose, it seemed the ship would inevitably sink. His conscience was pricked, and he quickly left the ship and returned by way of Saidnaya. After spending four days in the convent, he was again possessed by an irresistible desire to make the icon of the Mother of God his own. He apologized to the abbess, pretending that he had been unable to buy the required icon, and then he decided to leave the convent secretly. The next morning, as he was about to set out on the journey back to his own country and approached the convent gate, he was amazed to find that an invisible power barred his way, and it was as though a stone wall stood where the gate should have been. After many futile attempts, he was forced to hand the icon over to the abbess, confessing his intention. With tears of gratitude she glorified the Lord and His All-pure Mother. Today the holy Icon is visited by pilgrims seeking the Virgin Mary's blessings as it is believed to grant (or at least intercede for) healing and fertility miracles. It is notable that Syrian Muslims often visit and pray before the Icon as well.<ref>{{Citation |last=Belt |first=Don |title=The Forgotten Faithful|journal=National Geographic |volume=215|issue=6 |date=June 2009 |page=93 |postscript=.}}</ref>\n\n===Construction of the Convent===\nAccording to the tradition, [[Justinian I|emperor Justinian I]], while crossing Syria with his troops either on his way to the Holy Land or on a campaign against the Persians, came to this desert, where his army encamped and soon suffered thirst for lack of water. When they despaired, the emperor saw a beautiful gazelle off in the distance. He vigorously gave chase, hunting the animal until it tired and stopped on a rocky knoll and approached a spring of fresh water, but without giving the emperor the opportunity to shoot it. Suddenly, it transformed into an icon of the  [[Theotokos]], which shone with a brilliant light. A white hand stretched forth from it and a voice said, \"No, thou shalt not kill me, Justinian, but thou shalt build a church for me here on this hill.\" Then the strange heavenly light and majestic figure disappeared. Upon his return, Justinian related what he had seen to his subordinates and ordered them immediately to draw up a plan for the contemplated church. After some time had passed and the architects were unable to resolve the problems of the plan, the Holy Virgin \u2014 the gazelle \u2014 reappeared to Justinian in a dream and confided a magnificent plan to him for a convent, of which she would be the protectress. It is said that the basic structure of the convent follows this plan to this day. The convent soon gained such renown that it came to be ranked second only to Jerusalem as a place of pilgrimage, and nuns from every corner of Syria, Egypt, and other lands flocked to it. The holy icon El Chagoura appeared many years after the convent was constructed.\n\n===Crusader period===\nMagister Thietmar, a [[Germany|German]] chronicler, wrote of his pilgrimage to Saidnaya, devoting four pages to a description of the icon of Holy Mother and Child found at the convent.
