In recent literature, its importance in regards to treatment of cancerous cells and deeper insight into its deceptively complex pathways have been topics of increasing interest to medical researchers.\n\n==NK cells==\nThe typical ADCC involves activation of NK cells by antibodies in a multi-tiered progression of immune control.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lo Nigro|first=Cristiana|last2=Macagno|first2=Marco|last3=Sangiolo|first3=Dario|last4=Bertolaccini|first4=Luca|last5=Aglietta|first5=Massimo|last6=Merlano|first6=Marco Carlo|date=March 2019|title=NK-mediated antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity in solid tumors: biological evidence and clinical perspectives|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6462666/|journal=Annals of Translational Medicine|volume=7|issue=5|doi=10.21037/atm.2019.01.42|issn=2305-5839|pmc=6462666|pmid=31019955}}</ref> An NK cell expresses Fc\u03b3 receptors. These receptors recognize and bind to the reciprocal portion of an [[antibody]], such as [[IgG]], which binds to the surface of a [[pathogen]]-infected target cell. The most common of these Fc receptors on the surface of an NK cell is [[CD16]] or Fc\u03b3RIII. Once the Fc receptor binds to the Fc region of the antibody, the NK cell releases cytotoxic factors that cause the death of the target cell.\n\nDuring replication of a virus, some of the viral proteins are expressed on the cell surface membrane of the infected cell. Antibodies can then bind to these viral proteins. Next, the NK cells which have reciprocal Fc\u03b3 receptors will bind to that antibody, inducing the NK cell to release proteins such as [[perforin]] and [[protease]]s known as [[granzymes]], which causes the lysis of the infected cell to hinder the spread of the virus.\n\n==Eosinophils==\nLarge [[parasite]]s like [[helminth]]s are too big to be engulfed and killed by [[phagocytosis]]. They also have an external structure or [[integument]] that is resistant to attack by substances released by [[neutrophil]]s and [[macrophage]]s. After [[IgE]] coat these parasites, the [[Fc receptor]] (Fc\u025bRI) of an [[eosinophil]] will recognize IgE. Subsequently, interaction between Fc\u03b5RI and the Fc portion of helminth-bound IgE signals the eosinophil to [[Degranulation|degranulate]].\n\n==''In vitro'' assays==\nSeveral laboratory methods exist for determining the efficacy of [[antibodies]] or effector cells in eliciting ADCC. Usually, a target cell line expressing a certain surface-exposed [[antigen]] is incubated with antibody specific for that antigen. After washing, effector cells expressing Fc receptor CD16 are co-incubated with the antibody-labelled target cells. Effector cells are typically PBMCs ([[peripheral blood mononuclear cell]]), of which a small percentage are NK cells ([[Natural Killer cell]]); less often they are purified NK cells themselves. Over the course of a few hours a complex forms between the antibody, target cell, and effector cell which leads to lysis of the cell membrane of the target. If the target cell was pre-loaded with a label of some sort, that label is released in proportion to the amount of cell lysis. Cytotoxicity can be quantified by measuring the amount of label in solution compared to the amount of label that remains within healthy, intact cells.\n\nThe classical method of detecting this is the [[Chromium-51]] [<sup>51</sup>Cr] release assay; the [[Sulfur-35]] [<sup>35</sup>S] release assay is a little used radioisotope-based alternative. Target cell lysis is determined by measuring the amount of radiolabel released into the cell culture medium by means of a gamma counter or scintillation counter. A variety of non-radioactive methods are now in widespread use. Fluorescence-based methods include such things as direct labelling with a fluorescent dye like [[calcein]] or labelling with [[europium]] that becomes fluorescent when released Eu<sup>3+</sup> binds to a chelator. Fluorescence can be measured by means of multi-well fluorometers or by [[flow cytometry]] methods. There are also enzymatic-based assays in which the contents of the lysed cells includes cellular enzymes like [[GAPDH]] that remain active; supplying a substrate for that enzyme can catalyze a reaction whose product can be detected by [[luminescence]] or by [[absorbance]].\n\n==Medical Applications==\nNK cells are involved in killing tumor cells and other cells that may lack MHC I on their surface, indicating a non-self cell. NK cells have been shown to behave similarly to memory cells due to their ability to react to destroy non-host cells only after interacting with a host cell. As NK cells are not themselves specific to certain pathways of immune control, they are utilized a majority of the time in ADCC as a less discriminate cell destroyer than antibody-specific apoptosis mechanisms.The ability of activated ''ex vivo'' NK cells has been a topic of interest for the treatment of tumors. After early clinical trials involving activation through cytokines produced poor results and severe toxicological side effects, more recent studies have produced success in regulating metastatic tumors using interleukin proteins to activate the NK cell.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cheng|first=Min|last2=Chen|first2=Yongyan|last3=Xiao|first3=Weihua|last4=Sun|first4=Rui|last5=Tian|first5=Zhigang|date=May 2013|title=NK cell-based immunotherapy for malignant diseases|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201310|journal=Cellular & Molecular Immunology|language=en|volume=10|issue=3|pages=230\u2013252|doi=10.1038/cmi.2013.10|issn=2042-0226|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nThe effects against solid tumors of [[trastuzumab]] and [[rituximab]] [[monoclonal antibodies]] have been shown in experiments with mice to involve ADCC as an important mechanism of therapeutic action.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1038/74704 | title=Inhibitory Fc receptors modulate in vivo cytoxicity against tumor targets | last1=Clynes | first1=RA | last2=Towers |first2=TL | last3=Presta | first3=LG | last4=Ravetch | first4=JV | journal=Nat Med | year=2000 | volume=6 | issue=4 | pages=443\u20136 | pmid=10742152}}</ref> In the clinic, the FcgRIII 158V/F polymorphism interfere with the ability to generate ADCC responses ''in vitro'' during trastuzumab treatment.\n\n[[Multiple myeloma]] can be treated with [[daratumumab]] (Darzalex) monoclonal antibody.<ref>{{cite journal| last1=Sanchez| first1=L| last2=Wang| first2=Y | last3=Siegel| first3=DS| title=Daratumumab: a first-in-class CD38 monoclonal antibody for the treatment of multiple myeloma| journal=J Hematol Oncol| year=2016| volume=9 | issue=1 | page=51| pmid=27363983 | pmc=4929758| doi=10.1186/s13045-016-0283-0}}</ref> Studies with ''in vitro'' materials and patient materials indicate that ADCC is an important mechanism, along with CDC ([[Complement-dependent cytotoxicity]]).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=de Weers| first1=M| last2=Tai| first2=YT| last3=Bakker| first3=JM| last4=Vink| first4=T| last5=Jacobs|first5=DC|display-authors=etal| title=Daratumumab, a novel therapeutic human CD38 monoclonal antibody, induces killing of multiple myeloma and other hematological tumors|journal=J Immunol| year=2011| volume=186| issue=3| pages=1840\u20138| doi=10.4049/jimmunol.1003032| pmid=21187443| url=http://www.jimmunol.org/content/186/3/1840.long| accessdate=28 April 2017| doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nADCC as used in immune control is typically more useful for viral infections than bacterial infections due to IgG antibodies binding to virus-related antigens over prokaryotic cells.<ref>Sawa, Teiji; Kinoshita, Mao; Inoue, Keita; Ohara, Junya; Moriyama, Kiyoshi (2019/12). \"Immunoglobulin for Treating Bacterial Infections: One More Mechanism of Action\".

In recent literature, its importance in regards to treatment of cancerous cells and deeper insight into its deceptively complex pathways have been topics of increasing interest to medical researchers.\n\n==NK cells==\nThe typical ADCC involves activation of NK cells by antibodies in a multi-tiered progression of immune control.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lo Nigro|first=Cristiana|last2=Macagno|first2=Marco|last3=Sangiolo|first3=Dario|last4=Bertolaccini|first4=Luca|last5=Aglietta|first5=Massimo|last6=Merlano|first6=Marco Carlo|date=March 2019|title=NK-mediated antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity in solid tumors: biological evidence and clinical perspectives|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6462666/|journal=Annals of Translational Medicine|volume=7|issue=5|doi=10.21037/atm.2019.01.42|issn=2305-5839|pmc=6462666|pmid=31019955}}</ref> An NK cell expresses Fc\u03b3 receptors. These receptors recognize and bind to the reciprocal portion of an [[antibody]], such as [[IgG]], which binds to the surface of a [[pathogen]]-infected target cell. The most common of these Fc receptors on the surface of an NK cell is [[CD16]] or Fc\u03b3RIII. Once the Fc receptor binds to the Fc region of the antibody, the NK cell releases cytotoxic factors that cause the death of the target cell.\n\nDuring replication of a virus, some of the viral proteins are expressed on the cell surface membrane of the infected cell. Antibodies can then bind to these viral proteins. Next, the NK cells which have reciprocal Fc\u03b3 receptors will bind to that antibody, inducing the NK cell to release proteins such as [[perforin]] and [[protease]]s known as [[granzymes]], which causes the lysis of the infected cell to hinder the spread of the virus.\n\n==Eosinophils==\nLarge [[parasite]]s like [[helminth]]s are too big to be engulfed and killed by [[phagocytosis]]. They also have an external structure or [[integument]] that is resistant to attack by substances released by [[neutrophil]]s and [[macrophage]]s. After [[IgE]] coat these parasites, the [[Fc receptor]] (Fc\u025bRI) of an [[eosinophil]] will recognize IgE. Subsequently, interaction between Fc\u03b5RI and the Fc portion of helminth-bound IgE signals the eosinophil to [[Degranulation|degranulate]].\n\n==''In vitro'' assays==\nSeveral laboratory methods exist for determining the efficacy of [[antibodies]] or effector cells in eliciting ADCC. Usually, a target cell line expressing a certain surface-exposed [[antigen]] is incubated with antibody specific for that antigen. After washing, effector cells expressing Fc receptor CD16 are co-incubated with the antibody-labelled target cells. Effector cells are typically PBMCs ([[peripheral blood mononuclear cell]]), of which a small percentage are NK cells ([[Natural Killer cell]]); less often they are purified NK cells themselves. Over the course of a few hours a complex forms between the antibody, target cell, and effector cell which leads to lysis of the cell membrane of the target. If the target cell was pre-loaded with a label of some sort, that label is released in proportion to the amount of cell lysis. Cytotoxicity can be quantified by measuring the amount of label in solution compared to the amount of label that remains within healthy, intact cells.\n\nThe classical method of detecting this is the [[Chromium-51]] [<sup>51</sup>Cr] release assay; the [[Sulfur-35]] [<sup>35</sup>S] release assay is a little used radioisotope-based alternative. Target cell lysis is determined by measuring the amount of radiolabel released into the cell culture medium by means of a gamma counter or scintillation counter. A variety of non-radioactive methods are now in widespread use. Fluorescence-based methods include such things as direct labeling with a fluorescent dye like [[calcein]] or labeling with [[europium]] that becomes fluorescent when released Eu3+ binds to a chelator. Fluorescence can be measured by means of multi-well fluorometers or by [[flow cytometry]] methods. There are also enzymatic-based assays in which the contents of the lysed cells includes cellular enzymes like [[GAPDH]] that remain active; supplying a substrate for that enzyme can catalyze a reaction whose product can be detected by [[luminescence]] or by [[absorbance]].\n\n==Medical Applications==\nNK cells are involved in killing tumor cells and other cells that may lack MHC I on their surface, indicating a non-self cell. NK cells have been shown to behave similarly to memory cells due to their ability to react to destroy non-host cells only after interacting with a host cell. As NK cells are not themselves specific to certain pathways of immune control, they are utilized a majority of the time in ADCC as an less discriminate cell destroyer than antibody-specific apoptosis mechanisms.The ability of activated ''ex vivo'' NK cells has been a topic of interest for the treatment of tumors. After early clinical trials involving activation through cytokines produced poor results and severe toxicological side effects, more recent studies have produced success in regulating metastatic tumors using interleukin proteins to activate the NK cell.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cheng|first=Min|last2=Chen|first2=Yongyan|last3=Xiao|first3=Weihua|last4=Sun|first4=Rui|last5=Tian|first5=Zhigang|date=May 2013|title=NK cell-based immunotherapy for malignant diseases|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201310|journal=Cellular & Molecular Immunology|language=en|volume=10|issue=3|pages=230\u2013252|doi=10.1038/cmi.2013.10|issn=2042-0226|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nThe effects against solid tumors of [[trastuzumab]] and [[rituximab]] [[monoclonal antibodies]] have been shown in experiments with mice to involve ADCC as an important mechanism of therapeutic action.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1038/74704 | title=Inhibitory Fc receptors modulate in vivo cytoxicity against tumor targets | last1=Clynes | first1=RA | last2=Towers |first2=TL | last3=Presta | first3=LG | last4=Ravetch | first4=JV | journal=Nat Med | year=2000 | volume=6 | issue=4 | pages=443\u20136 | pmid=10742152}}</ref> In the clinic, the FcgRIII 158V/F polymorphism interfere with the ability to generate ADCC responses in vitro during trastuzumab treatment.\n\n[[Multiple myeloma]] can be treated with [[daratumumab]] (Darzalex) monoclonal antibody.<ref>{{cite journal| last1=Sanchez| first1=L| last2=Wang| first2=Y | last3=Siegel| first3=DS| title=Daratumumab: a first-in-class CD38 monoclonal antibody for the treatment of multiple myeloma| journal=J Hematol Oncol| year=2016| volume=9 | issue=1 | page=51| pmid=27363983 | pmc=4929758| doi=10.1186/s13045-016-0283-0}}</ref> Studies with in vitro materials and patient materials indicate that ADCC is an important mechanism, along with CDC ([[Complement-dependent cytotoxicity]]).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=de Weers| first1=M| last2=Tai| first2=YT| last3=Bakker| first3=JM| last4=Vink| first4=T| last5=Jacobs|first5=DC|display-authors=etal| title=Daratumumab, a novel therapeutic human CD38 monoclonal antibody, induces killing of multiple myeloma and other hematological tumors|journal=J Immunol| year=2011| volume=186| issue=3| pages=1840\u20138| doi=10.4049/jimmunol.1003032| pmid=21187443| url=http://www.jimmunol.org/content/186/3/1840.long| accessdate=28 April 2017| doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nADCC as used in immune control is typically more useful for viral infections than bacterial infections due to IgG antibodies binding to virus-related antigens over prokaryotic cells.<ref>Sawa, Teiji; Kinoshita, Mao; Inoue, Keita; Ohara, Junya; Moriyama, Kiyoshi (2019/12). \"Immunoglobulin for Treating Bacterial Infections: One More Mechanism of Action\".

On Ground 2, the \u2018implied repeal ground\u2019 the ERO was repealed by implication by the [[Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance]] and/or the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) as applied in Hong Kong by the Basic Law. On Ground 3, the ERO cannot empower the Chief Executive to make any regulation restricting fundamental rights under the Basic Law or Bill of Rights. On Ground 4, the \u2018principle of legality ground\u2019, the Chief Executive acted ''ultra vires'' in that the ERO only applies to emergency situations. On Ground 5A, the \u2019section 3 proportionality ground\u2019, section 3 of the PFCR, which prohibits the use of facial coverings, disproportionately restricts privacy, and freedom of expression and assembly; on Ground 5B, the \u2018section 5 proportionality ground\u2019, section 5, concerning enforcement powers, is also disproportionate.\n\n=== Ground 1: the delegation of legislative power ground ===\n\nThe applicants submitted that under the Basic Law, legislative power is exclusively vested in the Legislative Council; since the ERO would grant legislative power to the executive, it is inconsistent with the Basic Law.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=35}}</ref> The government submitted that there is \u2018nothing in the Basic Law which provides whether expressly or by implication that the LegCo cannot authorise the CEIC [Chief Executive in Council] to make regulations during an occasion of public danger or emergency\u2019, that the ERO had already twice been held to be valid, that regulations made thereunder were not intended to be permanent, and that the LegCo could apply negative vetting to such regulations.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=36}}</ref>\n\nThe court declined to rule on the question of the constitutionality of the making of regulations by the Chief Executive in Council on an occasion of an emergency, and solely considered that concerning public danger.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=37}}</ref> The court accepted that a distinction between \u2018general legislative power\u2019 and the power to make \u2018subordinate legislation\u2019.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=53}}</ref> It drew such a distinction on the basis that the LegCo is \u2018designated as ''the'' legislature\u2019{{efn|Emphasis the court\u2019s.}} and that in the Chinese text of the Basic Law gives the LegCo \u2018''functions'' which in Chinese is \u201c\u8077\u201d in the phrase \u201c\u8077\u6b0a\u201d\u2019, which \u2018connotes\u2026[a] \u2019job\u2019\u201d.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=52}}</ref> The court then determined that the character of the powers granted by the ERO was more akin to that of a general legislative power than a subsidiary one, for several reasons. First, the powers granted by the ERO seemed not so much to \u2019leav[e] another body to devise the detailed legal norms that elaborate or put flesh on the broad matters laid down in the primary legislation\u2019 so much as to allow general legislation\u2014thus this very regulation was the first enactment to concern face covering in Hong Kong.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=56}}</ref> Second, the phrase \u2018any regulations whatsoever\u2019 grants powers \u2018of the widest possible nature\u2019.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=57}}</ref> Third, \u2018public danger\u2019 is inadequately defined.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=60}}</ref> Fourth, the ERO grants the Chief Executive power to amend or suspend any other enactment.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=63}}</ref> Fifth, the ERO permits the Chief Executive to prescribe punishments up to life imprisonment, ''inter alia'', which exceed those envisaged by the Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance (Cap. 1) vis \u00e0 vis subsidiary legislation.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong ordinance|1|28|1|e}}</ref> Sixth, no time limit is envisaged by the ERO.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=68}}</ref> Seventh, negative vetting is an inadequate safeguard given, ''inter alia'', that its operation could be suspended by a regulation under the ERO, and that the legal effects of its application before repeal by the Legislative Council would not be undone even if negative vetting were possible.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=74}}</ref>\n\nOn the fourth ground, the government submitted that such clauses are entirely permissible in other common law jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom and Australia;<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=65}}</ref> however, the court rejected the applicability of such a [[Diceyan]] notion of absolute parliamentary sovereignty in Hong Kong, on the basis that the Legislative Council\u2019s powers are derived from the Basic Law.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=66}}</ref> Ultimately the court concluded that the ERO in allowing for the making of regulations by the Chief Executive at a time of \u2018public danger\u2019 did so sufficiently broadly that it \u2018seems\u2026to create in Hong Kong a separate source of laws that are primary legislation in all but name\u2019.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=80}}</ref>\n\nThe government further submitted that the ERO had been vetted for constitutionality before the handover as a \u2018factor in favour of validity\u2019;

the court accepted the submission of the government that the maintenance of law and order generally is a legitimate, and is the aim of the PFCR.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=130}}</ref> The court also held that there is a rational connection between the prohibition of the use of masks and those legitimate aims,<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=146}}</ref> rejecting the applicant\u2019s argument that lawful gatherings would also be impeded by the PFCR on the grounds that the wearing of masks made likelier the occurrence of unlawful activity at an otherwise lawful gathering,<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=138}}</ref> and accepting an affidavit submitted by the government that the wearing of masks could create a psychological disposition to commit unlawful acts that would otherwise not have occurred.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=140}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the court held that, excepting unlawful assemblies, the restrictions would unduly affect entirely peaceful gatherings,<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=111}}</ref> and that in view of, ''inter alia'', the lack of clarity concerning those merely \u2019at\u2019 but not participating in a gathering, the \u2019absence of\u2026.case-by-case evaluation or assessment\u2019, \u2018the lack of robust evidence on the effectiveness of the measure\u2019, and \u2018the importance\u2026.[of] freedom of expression,\u2026assembly,\u2026procession,\u2026and demonstration\u2019, the measure was not proportionate.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=166}}</ref> This being the third step of the analysis, the need for the fourth step was obviated, though the court expressed the view that it would have reached a similar conclusion had it considered the fourth step, viz., whether the PFCR would strike \u2018a reasonable balance between the societal benefits sought to promoted and the inroads made into the aforesaid protected rights.\u2019<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=167}}</ref>\n\n===Ground 5B: the \u2018section 5 proportionality ground\u2019===\n\nA similar 4-step proportionality analysis was made of section 5, which allows police officers to demand the removal of a facial covering. As above, the court held that section 5 had a legitimate aim (\u2019law enforcement\u2019),<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=178}}</ref> and was rationally connected to that aim.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=184}}</ref> However, because section 5 would apply extremely broadly, \u2018irrespective of whether there is any public emeting or procession taking place in the vicinity\u2019, and regardless of the risk of violence, section 5 could \u2018be used by a police officer for the random stoppage of anyone found wearing a facial covering in any public place\u2019, which \u2019exceeds what is reasonably necessary to achieve the aim of law enforcement\u2019 etc.,<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=189}}</ref> and so is disproportionate.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=191}}</ref>\n\n=== Relief order ===\n\nIn its judgement dated 18 November 2019, the court noted that it had \u2018not heard submissions on the question of relief\u2019;<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=194}}</ref> it therefore made a decision on 22 November.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.}}</ref>\n\nIt was common ground that the PFCR should be declared invalid on the basis that the ERO did not grant the Chief Executive power to make regulations on an occasion of public danger, and that all the substantive sections of the PFCR except for the prohibition on wearing a mask at an unlawful assembly were invalid in virtue of their disproportionality.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=4}}</ref>\n\n==== Suspension or temporary validity order ====\n\nHowever, the government sought an order by which the PFCR, and therefore the provisions of the ERO in use of the powers granted by which the PFCR was purported to be made should remain \u2018valid and of legal effect\u2019 pending a further appeal.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=5}}</ref> Such an order was sought on the grounds that the quashing of the PFCR would endanger public safety and the rule of law; the court was of the view, however, that those most likely to be involved in violent acts would act regardless of the validity of the PFCR,<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=17}}</ref> and that the court had already emphasised the importance of the rule of law.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=20}}</ref> To the latter, they added that they were unable to accept that they should make such an order purely because of the risk that to fail to do so could be perceived incorrectly by some.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=20}}</ref>\n\nThe government, however, alternatively sought a \u2018suspension order\u2019, whose effect would be ensure that the government would not \u2019openly [act] against a court\u2019s declaration\u2019.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=23}}</ref> It differs from the \u2018temporary validity order\u2019 sought above in that it would not ultimately render actions taken under impugned enactments of legal validity.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=24}}</ref> The court was of the view that the continued enforcement of the PFCR would likely cause more conflict, and therefore declined to make such a suspension order on the grounds the government sought.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=35}}</ref>\n\n==== Disposition ====\n\nThe court held the ERO, insofar as \u2018public danger\u2019 is concerned, unconstitutional, and therefore declared the PFCR invalid and of no effect.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=42}}</ref> On separate grounds it also declared all the substantive sections of the PFCR excepting that prohibiting the use of masks at an unlawful assembly inconsistent with the Basic Law and the Bill of Rights, and therefore of no effect.\n\nNotwithstanding its deliberations above, the court in view of a likely appeal to the Court of Appeal granted a temporary suspension order of seven days.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=38}}</ref>\n\n==Court of Appeal case==\n\nThe government gave notice of its intention to appeal on 25 November 2020.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=7}}</ref> On 9 April 2020, the court ruled that the ERO, insofar as occasions of public danger are concerned, is valid, and therefore that the PFCR is valid and of legal effect.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=353}}</ref> It upheld the Court of First Instance\u2019s ruling on the disproportionality of the PFCR in public meetings and processions permitted by the Commissioner of Police as well as on the powers granted to police to require persons to remove face coverings, but quashed its ruling and therefore upheld the PFCR at unauthorised assemblies.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=355}}</ref>\n\n=== Ground 1: general or subordinate legislative power? ===\n\nThe court accepted the initial reasoning of the CFI concerning the criteria by which the constitutionality of the ERO on an occasion of public danger should be determined.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=51}}</ref> If the ERO were to delegate power to make primary legislation, it would be unconstitutional, but if it were to delegate subordinate legislation, it would be constitutional.\n\nAlthough, as the CFI noted, \u2018public danger\u2019 is not defined by the ERO,<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=131}}</ref> the court was of the view that \u2018there is nothing objectionable in itself to task the CEIC [Chief Executive in Council] to determine if an occasion of public danger exists\u2019.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=132}}</ref> Since \u2018emergency or public danger is not capable of exhaustive definition\u2019, legislation in that connection is \u2018necessarily wide and extensive in scope\u2019,<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=126}}</ref> and so the broadness of the ERO was not sufficient to rule it unconstitutional.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=128}}</ref> Further objections considered the norms established by the Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance (Cap. 1.) vis \u00e0 vis subordinate legislation: the CFI were of the view that the ERO envisaged regulations beyond the scope of the norms established by the IGCO, and therefore that the ERO would allow the enactment of primary legislation by the Chief Executive,<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=144}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=146}}</ref> but the court held that the IGCO was disapplied by implication.\n\nIn view of the above, the court rejected the application for judicial review on Ground 1.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=155}}</ref>\n\n=== Grounds 5A and 5B ===\n\n==== Section 3(1)(b): unauthorised assembly ====\n\nWhereas the CFI held that \u2018an assembly which is \u201cunauthorized\u201d may yet be entirely peaceful\u2019,<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=154}}</ref> the Court objected to the CFI\u2019s decision that section 3(1)(b), which prohibits the wearing of masks at such assemblies, would be disproportionate. First, the court reconsidered the nature of the definition of an unauthorised assembly as defined by the [[Public Order Ordinance|POO]]. The first scenario in which an assembly would be unauthorised would be a procession or meeting in contravention of a requirement that the Commissioner of Police should be notified and indicate no objection thereto.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=188}}</ref> The construction of the POO must be \u2018compatible with the fundamental right of demonstration and procession\u2019, and therefore in line with \u2018the principle of tolerance and proportionality\u2019\u2014in other words, \u2018there should be prior warnings\u2019 before \u2018arrests and disperals\u2019 etc. occur, unless there is a \u2018seriuos and imminent threat risk to public order and safety\u2019 due to violence or other \u2018reprehensible conducts[sic]\u2019.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=193}}</ref> Second, such a gathering could fail to obey an order by the Commissioner of Police.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=188}}</ref> A gathering would be unlikely to solely fall under this provision, since an un-notified and un-notifiable gathering of this sort would likely not be one at which the Commissioner would be present, so the former analysis applies; moreover even if it were not to, \u2018the principle of tolerance and requirement of proportionality\u2019 also hold.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=194}}</ref> The third scenario is that some direction is given to disperse or vary the route or place etc. of a gathering under section 17(2) or (3) of the POO.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=188}}</ref> Again, the principle of tolerance and proportionality holds.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=200}}</ref> Therefore, at all unauthorised assemblies, either some sort of violent conduct has occurred, or the police have publicly issued a warning and order under section 17(3) of the POO.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=200}}</ref> Moreover a person must be aware of the order to refuse or willfully neglect to obey it,<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=201}}</ref> and cannot knowingly take part in an unauthorised assembly unless aware that it was unauthorised.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=202}}</ref> The court therefore held that the CFI had envisaged a highly improbable scenario in deciding that the prohibition on the wearing of masks at an entirely orderly assembly was implied by section 3(1)(b) of the PFCR.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=217}}</ref>\n\nThe court summarised its reasoning in 12 steps.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=238}}</ref>\n# The PFCR is enacted in exercise of the powers granted to the Chief Executive under the ERO in response to a public danger arising from the [[2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests]], and its repeal would be \u2018expected\u2019 on the subsiding of that danger.\n# The wearing of masks contributes to that pbulic danger.\n# Section 3(1)(b) prohibits facial coverings only at unauthorised assemblies. It does not prevent the wearing of masks at authorised gatherings held in compliance with conditions imposed by the police.\n# The wearing of facial coverings is, however, only prohibited when a person ''remains'' at an unauthorised assembly after an order is made to disperse, or if violent conduct were to occur threatening public safety. \n# Section 4 provides a defence on the basis of a \u2018reasonable excuse\u2019, e.g., that there was no \u2018reasonable opportunity to leave the scene.\u2019\n# Refusal to disperse is itself an unlawful act.\n# Even if those refusing to disperse do so in exercise of a right to peaceful demonstration, facial coverings are not \u2018at the core of such right[sic]\u2019.\n# An order to disperse would only be made where refusal to disperse would create a risk of a brech of the peace, especially in view of \u2018black block tactics\u2019.\n# Wearing of facial coverings impedes law enforcement by preventing identification and segregation of violent protesters. \n# It also endangers the right of peaceful demonstration by precluding certain less intrusive police action.\n# Therefore, the maintenance of law and order itself is necessary to preserve the right of assembly.\n# Therefore, safeguards both from common law principles outlined above and the judiciary should \u2018prevent arbitrariness in the exercise of discretion by the police\u2019.\n\nIn conclusion, it held that the prohibition on the use of masks at unauthorised assemblies is constitutional.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong

an occasion of public danger by the ERO was unconstitutional, and, therefore, that the entirety of the PFCR was unconstitutional because it was in exercise of those powers.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok Wing Hang and others v Chief Executive in Council and another|pinpoint=42}}</ref> On separate grounds it also declared all the substantive sections of the PFCR excepting that prohibiting the use of masks at an unlawful assembly inconsistent with the Basic Law and the Bill of Rights, and therefore of no effect.\n\nThe Court of Appeal ruled that the ERO was in fact constitutional on occasions of public danger, and therefore that the PFCR was not invalid on those grounds.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=353}}</ref> It additionally held that section 3(1)(b) of the PFCR, which prohibited masks at certain \u2018unauthorised assemblies\u2019, is proportionate, and therefore valid, but upheld the decision of the CFI that the PFCR is invalid insofar as it prohibits masks at authorised assemblies and meetings.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=192}}</ref>\n\n== Court of First Instance ==\n\nThe court heard two applications for judicial review, submitted in early October.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=10}}</ref> The first was submitted by 24 members of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]], and the second by [[Leung Kwok-hung]], a former member. Four other applications were made, each of the applicants in which were instructed to await the outcome of the initial case. The court refused to grant an interim injunction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1484562-20191006.htm?spTabChangeable=0|title=High Court again refuses injunction over mask ban|work=RTHK|language=en-gb|access-date=2019-10-08}}</ref> Both applications were conjoined into a single set of hearings. On 17 October, the judiciary decided that two judges should hear the case, instead of the usual one; the move was seen as indicative of the significance of the case by a number of legal experts.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Lau|first=Chris|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3033406/rare-significant-move-hong-kong-judiciary-appoints-two|title=In rare, \u2018significant\u2019 move, Hong Kong judiciary appoints two judges to hear legal challenges against anti-mask law|date=17 October 2019|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe court considered 5 grounds of appeal.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=11}}</ref> On Ground 1, the \u2018delegation of legislative power ground\u2019, the [[Emergency Regulations Ordinance]] (ERO) in exercise of the powers granted by which the Chief Executive made the PFCR was an impermissible grant of legislative power that contravened the separation of powers under the [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law]]. On Ground 2, the \u2018implied repeal ground\u2019 the ERO was repealed by implication by the [[Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance]] and/or the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) as applied in Hong Kong by the Basic Law. On Ground 3, the ERO cannot empower the Chief Executive to make any regulation restricting fundamental rights under the Basic Law or Bill of Rights. On Ground 4, the \u2018principle of legality ground\u2019, the Chief Executive acted ''ultra vires'' in that the ERO only applies to emergency situations. On Ground 5A, the \u2019section 3 proportionality ground\u2019, section 3 of the PFCR, which prohibits the use of facial coverings, disproportionately restricts privacy, and freedom of expression and assembly; on Ground 5B, the \u2018section 5 proportionality ground\u2019, section 5, concerning enforcement powers, is also disproportionate.\n\n=== Ground 1: the delegation of legislative power ground ===\n\nThe applicants submitted that under the Basic Law, legislative power is exclusively vested in the Legislative Council; since the ERO would grant legislative power to the executive, it is inconsistent with the Basic Law.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=35}}</ref> The government submitted that there is \u2018nothing in the Basic Law which provides whether expressly or by implication that the LegCo cannot authorise the CEIC [Chief Executive in Council] to make regulations during an occasion of public danger or emergency\u2019, that the ERO had already twice been held to be valid, that regulations made thereunder were not intended to be permanent, and that the LegCo could apply negative vetting to such regulations.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=36}}</ref>\n\nThe court declined to rule on the question of the constitutionality of the making of regulations by the Chief Executive in Council on an occasion of an emergency, and solely considered that concerning public danger.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=37}}</ref> The court accepted that a distinction between \u2018general legislative power\u2019 and the power to make \u2018subordinate legislation\u2019.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=53}}</ref> It drew such a distinction on the basis that the LegCo is \u2018designated as ''the'' legislature\u2019{{efn|Emphasis the court\u2019s.}} and that in the Chinese text of the Basic Law gives the LegCo \u2018''functions'' which in Chinese is \u201c\u8077\u201d in the phrase \u201c\u8077\u6b0a\u201d\u2019, which \u2018connotes\u2026[a] \u2019job\u2019\u201d.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=52}}</ref> The court then determined that the character of the powers granted by the ERO was more akin to that of a general legislative power than a subsidiary one, for several reasons. First, the powers granted by the ERO seemed not so much to \u2019leav[e] another body to devise the detailed legal norms that elaborate or put flesh on the broad matters laid down in the primary legislation\u2019 so much as to allow general legislation\u2014thus this very regulation was the first enactment to concern face covering in Hong Kong.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=56}}</ref> Second, the phrase \u2018any regulations whatsoever\u2019 grants powers \u2018of the widest possible nature\u2019.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=57}}</ref> Third, \u2018public danger\u2019 is inadequately defined.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=60}}</ref> Fourth, the ERO grants the Chief Executive power to amend or suspend any other enactment.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=63}}</ref> Fifth, the ERO permits the Chief Executive to prescribe punishments up to life imprisonment, ''inter alia'', which exceed those envisaged by the Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance (Cap. 1) vis \u00e0 vis subsidiary legislation.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong ordinance|1|28|1|e}}</ref> Sixth, no time limit is envisaged by the ERO.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=68}}</ref> Seventh, negative vetting is an inadequate safeguard given, ''inter alia'', that its operation could be suspended by a regulation under the ERO, and that the legal effects of its application before repeal by the Legislative Council would not be undone even if negative vetting were possible.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=74}}</ref> \n\nOn the fourth ground, the government submitted that such clauses are entirely permissible in other common law jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom and Australia;<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=65}}</ref> however, the court rejected the applicability of such a [[Diceyan]] notion of absolute parliamentary sovereignty in Hong Kong, on the basis that the Legislative Council\u2019s powers are derived from the Basic Law.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=66}}</ref> Ultimately the court concluded that the ERO in allowing for the making of regulations by the Chief Executive at a time of \u2018public danger\u2019 did so sufficiently broadly that it \u2018seems\u2026to create in Hong Kong a separate source of laws that are primary legislation in all but name\u2019.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=80}}</ref>\n\nThe government further submitted that the ERO had been vetted for constitutionality before the handover as a \u2018factor in favour of validity\u2019; however, the court held that article 160 of the Basic Law provided for the subsequent discovery of unconstitutionality.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=94}}</ref> The court therefore held the PFCR unconstitutional under ground 1, at least insofar as \u2018public danger\u2019 is concerned.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=97}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=60}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=193}}</ref>\n\n=== Ground 2: the \u2018implied repeal ground\u2019 ===\n\nThe applicants submitted that legislation could only derogate from the Bill of Rights when \u2018the life of the nation\u2019 is at risk, but that the ERO allowed for such derogations in a larger set of circumstances, and therefore was repealed by implication.{{efn|For brevity, the full argument is omitted; it may be seen in cited paragraph.}}<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=101}}</ref> However, the court held that rights under the Bill of Rights could also be restricted when \u2019compliant with the principle of proportionality\u2019.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=105}}</ref>\n\n===Ground 3: the \u2018prescribed by law ground\u2019===\n\nThe applicants submitted that the ERO granted such wide powers that it violated the principle of legal certanity and accessibility provided for by Article 39 of the Basic Law, by which a citizen should be able to anticipate the legal consequences, if appropriately advised, of a particular action.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=111}}</ref> The court, however, held that the ERO itself was not necessarily unconstitutional under this principle, but rather that regulations made in exercise of the powers granted by it would have to meet this principle.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=114}}</ref>\n\n===Ground 4: the \u2018principle of legality ground\u2019===\n\nThe applicants submitted that a \u2018principle of statutory construction\u2026.requires that any abrogation or restriction of fundamental rights by statute should be done unmistakably\u2019,<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=122}}</ref> but that the ERO does not \u2018advert to any specific fundamental right\u2019,<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=123}}</ref> and so does not grant the Chief Executive power to restrict fundamental rights.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=111122}}</ref> Since the PFCR does affect fundamental rights, it is ''ultra vires'' the ERO.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=121}}</ref>\n\nThe court, however, was of the view that Grounds 1 and 4 were in tension: in the former, the applicants \u2018submit that\u2026.the ERO is of the widest scope, essentially conferring an unrestricted and unfettered legislative power\u2019\u201a but in the latter, they suggested that it should be construed as \u2018not authorising\u2026.any restrict[ion] of fundamental rights\u2019\u2014since the court had already dealt with Ground 1, it was not necessary to rule on \u2018an alternative ground\u2019, that is, Ground 4.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=125}}</ref>\n\n===Ground 5A: the \u2018section 3 proportionality ground\u2019===\n\nIt was common ground between the applicant and respondent that a 4-step proportionality analysis should be used to determine the validity of section 3, by which the use of face coverings in certain circumstances was prohibited.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=128}}</ref> The first step was the question of whether the PFCR sought to achieve a \u2018legitimate aim\u2019; the court accepted the submission of the government that the maintenance of law and order generally is a legitimate, and is the aim of the PFCR.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=130}}</ref> The court also held that there is a rational connection between the prohibition of the use of masks and those legitimate aims,<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=146}}</ref> rejecting the applicant\u2019s argument that lawful gatherings would also be impeded by the PFCR on the grounds that the wearing of masks made likelier the occurrence of unlawful activity at an otherwise lawful gathering,<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=138}}</ref> and accepting an affidavit submitted by the government that the wearing of masks could create a psychological disposition to commit unlawful acts that would otherwise not have occurred.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=140}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the court held that, excepting unlawful assemblies, the restrictions would unduly affect entirely peaceful gatherings,<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=111}}</ref> and that in view of, ''inter alia'', the lack of clarity concerning those merely \u2019at\u2019 but not participating in a gathering, the \u2019absence of\u2026.case-by-case evaluation or assessment\u2019, \u2018the lack of robust evidence on the effectiveness of the measure\u2019, and \u2018the importance\u2026.[of] freedom of expression,\u2026assembly,\u2026procession,\u2026and demonstration\u2019, the measure was not proportionate.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=166}}</ref> This being the third step of the analysis, the need for the fourth step was obviated, though the court expressed the view that it would have reached a similar conclusion had it considered the fourth step, viz., whether the PFCR would strike \u2018a reasonable balance between the societal benefits sought to promoted and the inroads made into the aforesaid protected rights.\u2019<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=167}}</ref>\n\n===Ground 5B: the \u2018section 5 proportionality ground\u2019===\n\nA similar 4-step proportionality analysis was made of section 5, which allows police officers to demand the removal of a facial covering. As above, the court held that section 5 had a legitimate aim (\u2019law enforcement\u2019),<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=178}}</ref> and was rationally connected to that aim.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=184}}</ref> However, because section 5 would apply extremely broadly, \u2018irrespective of whether there is any public emeting or procession taking place in the vicinity\u2019, and regardless of the risk of violence, section 5 could \u2018be used by a police officer for the random stoppage of anyone found wearing a facial covering in any public place\u2019, which \u2019exceeds what is reasonably necessary to achieve the aim of law enforcement\u2019 etc.,<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=189}}</ref> and so is disproportionate.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=191}}</ref>\n\n=== Relief order ===\n\nIn its judgement dated 18 November 2019, the court noted that it had \u2018not heard submissions on the question of relief\u2019;<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=194}}</ref> it therefore made a decision on 22 November.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.}}</ref>\n\nIt was common ground that the PFCR should be declared invalid on the basis that the ERO did not grant the Chief Executive power to make regulations on an occasion of public danger, and that all the substantive sections of the PFCR except for the prohibition on wearing a mask at an unlawful assembly were invalid in virtue of their disproportionality.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=4}}</ref>\n\n==== Suspension or temporary validity order ====\n\nHowever, the government sought an order by which the PFCR, and therefore the provisions of the ERO in use of the powers granted by which the PFCR was purported to be made should remain \u2018valid and of legal effect\u2019 pending a further appeal.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=5}}</ref> Such an order was sought on the grounds that the quashing of the PFCR would endanger public safety and the rule of law; the court was of the view, however, that those most likely to be involved in violent acts would act regardless of the validity of the PFCR,<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=17}}</ref> and that the court had already emphasised the importance of the rule of law.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=20}}</ref> To the latter, they added that they were unable to accept that they should make such an order purely because of the risk that to fail to do so could be perceived incorrectly by some.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=20}}</ref>\n\nThe government, however, alternatively sought a \u2018suspension order\u2019, whose effect would be ensure that the government would not \u2019openly [act] against a court\u2019s declaration\u2019.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=23}}</ref> It differs from the \u2018temporary validity order\u2019 sought above in that it would not ultimately render actions taken under impugned enactments of legal validity.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=24}}</ref> The court was of the view that the continued enforcement of the PFCR would likely cause more conflict, and therefore declined to make such a suspension order on the grounds the government sought.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=35}}</ref> \n\n==== Disposition ====\n\nThe court held the ERO, insofar as \u2018public danger\u2019 is concerned, unconstitutional, and therefore declared the PFCR invalid and of no effect.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=42}}</ref> On separate grounds it also declared all the substantive sections of the PFCR excepting that prohibiting the use of masks at an unlawful assembly inconsistent with the Basic Law and the Bill of Rights, and therefore of no effect.\n\nNotwithstanding its deliberations above, the court in view of a likely appeal to the Court of Appeal granted a temporary suspension order of seven days.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=38}}</ref>\n\n==Court of Appeal case==\n\nThe government gave notice of its intention to appeal on 25 November 2020.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=7}}</ref> On 9 April 2020, the court ruled that the ERO, insofar as occasions of public danger are concerned, is valid, and therefore that the PFCR is valid and of legal effect.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=353}}</ref> It upheld the Court of First Instance\u2019s ruling on the disproportionality of the PFCR in public meetings and processions permitted by the Commissioner of Police as well as on the powers granted to police to require persons to remove face coverings, but quashed its ruling and therefore upheld the PFCR at unauthorised assemblies.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=355}}</ref>\n\n=== Ground 1: general or subordinate legislative power? ===\n\nThe court accepted the initial reasoning of the CFI concerning the criteria by which the constitutionality of the ERO on an occasion of public danger should be determined.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=51}}</ref> If the ERO were to delegate power to make primary legislation, it would be unconstitutional, but if it were to delegate subordinate legislation, it would be constitutional.\n\nAlthough, as the CFI noted, \u2018public danger\u2019 is not defined by the ERO,<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=131}}</ref> the court was of the view that \u2018there is nothing objectionable in itself to task the CEIC [Chief Executive in Council] to determine if an occasion of public danger exists\u2019.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=132}}</ref> Since \u2018emergency or public danger is not capable of exhaustive definition\u2019, legislation in that connection is \u2018necessarily wide and extensive in scope\u2019,<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=126}}</ref> and so the broadness of the ERO was not sufficient to rule it unconstitutional.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=128}}</ref> Further objections considered the norms established by the Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance (Cap. 1.) vis \u00e0 vis subordinate legislation: the CFI were of the view that the ERO envisaged regulations beyond the scope of the norms established by the IGCO, and therefore that the ERO would allow the enactment of primary legislation by the Chief Executive,<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=144}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=146}}</ref> but the court held that the IGCO was disapplied by implication.\n\nIn view of the above, the court rejected the application for judicial review on Ground 1.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=155}}</ref>\n\n=== Grounds 5A and 5B ===\n\n==== Section 3(1)(b): unauthorised assembly ====\n\nWhereas the CFI held that \u2018an assembly which is \u201cunauthorized\u201d may yet be entirely peaceful\u2019,<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=154}}</ref> the Court objected to the CFI\u2019s decision that section 3(1)(b), which prohibits the wearing of masks at such assemblies, would be disproportionate. First, the court reconsidered the nature of the definition of an unauthorised assembly as defined by the [[Public Order Ordinance|POO]]. The first scenario in which an assembly would be unauthorised would be a procession or meeting in contravention of a requirement that the Commissioner of Police should be notified and indicate no objection thereto.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=188}}</ref> The construction of the POO must be \u2018compatible with the fundamental right of demonstration and procession\u2019, and therefore in line with \u2018the principle of tolerance and proportionality\u2019\u2014in other words, \u2018there should be prior warnings\u2019 before \u2018arrests and disperals\u2019 etc. occur, unless there is a \u2018seriuos and imminent threat risk to public order and safety\u2019 due to violence or other \u2018reprehensible conducts[sic]\u2019.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=193}}</ref> Second, such a gathering could fail to obey an order by the Commissioner of Police.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=188}}</ref> A gathering would be unlikely to solely fall under this provision, since an un-notified and un-notifiable gathering of this sort would likely not be one at which the Commissioner would be present, so the former analysis applies; moreover even if it were not to, \u2018the principle of tolerance and requirement of proportionality\u2019 also hold.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=194}}</ref> The third scenario is that some direction is given to disperse or vary the route or place etc. of a gathering under section 17(2) or (3) of the POO.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=188}}</ref> Again, the principle of tolerance and proportionality holds.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=200}}</ref> Therefore, at all unauthorised assemblies, either some sort of violent conduct has occurred, or the police have publicly issued a warning and order under section 17(3) of the POO.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=200}}</ref> Moreover a person must be aware of the order to refuse or willfully neglect to obey it,<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=201}}</ref> and cannot knowingly take part in an unauthorised assembly unless aware that it was unauthorised.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=202}}</ref> The court therefore held that the CFI had envisaged a highly improbable scenario in deciding that the prohibition on the wearing of masks at an entirely orderly assembly was implied by section 3(1)(b) of the PFCR.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=217}}</ref>\n\nThe court summarised its reasoning in 12 steps.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=238}}</ref>\n# The PFCR is enacted in exercise of the powers granted to the Chief Executive under the ERO in response to a public danger arising from the [[2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests]], and its repeal would be \u2018expected\u2019 on the subsiding of that danger.\n# The wearing of masks contributes to that pbulic danger.\n# Section 3(1)(b) prohibits facial coverings only at unauthorised assemblies. It does not prevent the wearing of masks at authorised gatherings held in compliance with conditions imposed by the police.\n# The wearing of facial coverings is, however, only prohibited when a person ''remains'' at an unauthorised assembly after an order is made to disperse, or if violent conduct were to occur threatening public safety. \n# Section 4 provides a defence on the basis of a \u2018reasonable excuse\u2019, e.g., that there was no \u2018reasonable opportunity to leave the scene.\u2019\n# Refusal to disperse is itself an unlawful act.\n# Even if those refusing to disperse do so in exercise of a right to peaceful demonstration, facial coverings are not \u2018at the core of such right[sic]\u2019.\n# An order to disperse would only be made where refusal to disperse would create a risk of a brech of the peace, especially in view of \u2018black block tactics\u2019.\n# Wearing of facial coverings impedes law enforcement by preventing identification and segregation of violent protesters. \n# It also endangers the right of peaceful demonstration by precluding certain less intrusive police action.\n# Therefore, the maintenance of law and order itself is necessary to preserve the right of assembly.\n# Therefore, safeguards both from common law principles outlined above and the judiciary should \u2018prevent arbitrariness in the exercise of discretion by the police\u2019.\n\nIn conclusion, it held that the prohibition on the use of masks at unauthorised assemblies is constitutional.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong

with {{mono|COMMAND.COM}} but provides the following extensions over it:\n\n* More detailed error messages than the blanket \"[[Bad command or file name]]\" (in the case of malformed commands) of {{mono|COMMAND.COM}}. In OS/2, errors are reported in the chosen language of the system, their text being taken from the system message files. The {{mono|[[help (command)|HELP]]}} command can then be issued with the error message number to obtain further information.\n* Supports using of arrow keys to scroll through command history. (Under DOS this function was only available under [[DR DOS]] (through [[HISTORY (CONFIG.SYS directive)|HISTORY]]) and later via a external component called {{mono|[[DOSKEY]]}}.)\n* Adds [[command-line completion]] for file and folder paths.\n* Treats the [[caret]] character ({{mono|^}}) as the [[escape character]]; the character following it is to be taken literally. There are special characters in {{mono|cmd.exe}} and {{mono|COMMAND.COM}} (e.g. \"{{mono|<}}\", \"{{mono|>}}\" and \"|\") that are meant to alter the behavior of the command line processor. The caret character forces the command line processor to interpret them literally.\n* Supports delayed variable expansion with [[SETLOCAL EnableDelayedExpansion]], allowing values of variables to be calculated at runtime instead of during parsing of script before execution (Windows 2000 and later), fixing DOS idioms that made using [[control structures]] hard and complex.<ref name=\"Delay\"/> The extensions can be disabled, providing a stricter compatibility mode.\n\nInternal commands have also been improved:\n\n* The {{mono|[[DELTREE]]}} command was merged into the {{mono|[[RMDIR|RD]]}} command, as part of its {{mono|/S}} [[Switch (command line)|switch]].\n* {{mono|SetLocal}} and {{mono|EndLocal}} commands limit the scope of changes to the environment. Changes made to the command line environment after {{mono|SetLocal}} commands are local to the [[batch file]]. {{mono|EndLocal}} command restores the previous settings.<ref name=\"SetLocal\"/>\n* The {{mono|Call}} command allows subroutines within batch file. The {{mono|Call}} command in {{mono|COMMAND.COM}} only supports calling external batch files.\n* File name parser extensions to the {{mono|Set}} command are comparable with [[C shell]].{{Elucidate|reason=|date=October 2015}}\n* The {{mono|Set}} command can perform [[Expression Evaluation|expression evaluation]].\n* An expansion of the {{mono|[[For loop|For]]}} command supports parsing files and arbitrary sets in addition to file names.\n* The new {{mono|[[PUSHD|PushD]]}} and {{mono|[[POPD|PopD]]}} commands provide access past navigated paths similar to \"forward\" and \"back\" buttons in a web browser or [[File Explorer]].\n* The conditional {{mono|IF}} command can perform [[Case sensitivity|case-insensitive]] comparisons and numeric equality and inequality comparisons in addition to case-sensitive string comparisons. (This was available in DR-DOS, but not in [[PC&nbsp;DOS]] or [[MS-DOS]].)\n\n==See also==\n* [[Comparison of command shells]]\n* [[List of DOS commands]]\n* [[Windows Terminal]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Zachary_1994\">{{Cite book |title=Showstopper!

The name refers to its executable filename.  It is also commonly referred to as '''cmd''' or the '''Command Prompt''', referring to the default window title on Windows.  The implementations differ on the various systems but the behavior and basic set of commands is generally consistent.  {{mono|cmd.exe}} is the counterpart of {{mono|[[COMMAND.COM]]}} in [[DOS]] and [[Windows 9x]] systems, and analogous to the [[Unix shell]]s used on [[Unix-like]] systems. The initial version of {{mono|cmd.exe}} for [[Windows NT]] was developed by Therese Stowell.<ref name=\"Zachary_1994\"/>\n[[Windows CE 2.11]] was the first embedded Windows release to support a console and a Windows CE version of {{mono|cmd.exe}}.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Douglas McConnaughey Boling|year=2001|title=Programming Microsoft Windows CE|edition=2nd|publisher=[[Microsoft Press]]|isbn=978-0735614437}}</ref>\nOn [[Windows CE .NET 4.2]],<ref>[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/embedded/ms879823(v%3dmsdn.10) Command Processor Shell (Windows CE .NET 4.2) | Microsoft Docs]</ref> [[Windows CE 5.0]]<ref>[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/embedded/aa453925%28v%3dmsdn.10%29 Command Processor Shell (Windows CE 5.0) | Microsoft Docs]</ref> and [[Windows Embedded CE 6.0]]<ref>[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/embedded/ee499728%28v%3dwinembedded.60%29 Command Processor Shell (Windows Embedded CE 6.0) | Microsoft Docs]</ref> it is also referred to as '''Command Processor Shell'''.\nThe ReactOS implementation of {{mono|cmd.exe}} is derived from FreeCOM, the [[FreeDOS]] command line interpreter.<ref name=\"ReactOS\" />\n\n==Operation==\n{{mono|cmd.exe}} interacts with the user through a [[command-line interface]]. On Windows, this interface is implemented through the [[Win32 console]]. {{mono|cmd.exe}} may take advantage of features available to native programs of its own platform. For example, on OS/2 and Windows, it can use real [[Pipeline (Unix)|pipes]] in command pipelines, allowing both sides of the pipeline to run concurrently. As a result, it is possible to redirect the [[standard error stream]]. ({{mono|COMMAND.COM}} uses temporary files, and runs the two sides serially, one after the other.)\n\nMultiple commands can be processed in a single command line using the command separator {{mono|&&}}.<ref name=\"docs.microsoft.com\">[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/cmd cmd | Microsoft Docs]</ref>\nFor example:\n<source lang=\"dos\">\nC:\\>CommandA && CommandB && CommandC\n</source>\n\nOn [[Windows XP]] or later, the maximum length of the string that can be used at the command prompt is 8191 characters. On earlier versions, such as [[Windows 2000]] or [[Windows NT 4.0]], the maximum length of the string is 2047 characters.

His act as a [[football hooligan]] led to him becoming a top comedy act in Scottish [[football (soccer)|football]] clubs. He is probably best known for writing and performing the football [[anthem]] \"[[Ally's Tartan Army]]\" for the [[Scotland national football team]]'s appearance at the [[1978 World Cup]].

Cameron promptly put all of the profits from his [[single (music)|single]] into producing an [[album]], which he hoped to release while the World Cup fever in Scotland was still going strong. He was too late - Scotland team went out of the World Cup early and Cameron's album fared equally badly. Andy also released a song in the 70's for his beloved Glasgow Rangers - 'The Greatest Team of All' - which still appears on the odd Rangers compilation album.\n\nIn 1975 he came second in ''[[New Faces]]'' leading to several appearances on variety shows such as ''Live at Her Majesty\u2019s'' with [[Jimmy Tarbuck]] and ''Tarby and Friends''.\n\nIn 1979, soon after the establishment of [[BBC Radio Scotland]], he was given a thirteen-week contract to present a programme of [[music]] and [[humour]]. The show eventually ran for fifteen years. He was voted Radio Personality of the year in 1984. He had his own series on [[BBC Scotland]] in 1979 and again in 1982. He was awarded Scottish Television Personality of the Year for his 1983 series called ''It\u2019s Andy Cameron''.\n\nIn the early 1980s he was invited to speak in debates at [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] and [[Oxford University|Oxford Universities]] alongside [[Arnold Brown (comedian)|Arnold Brown]] and [[James Naughtie]].\n\nIn 1984, Cameron presented [[STV (TV network)|STV]]'s ''[[Hogmanay]]'' show. The following year he presented the BBC Scotland Hogmanay show, and continued to do so until 1989. His last Hogmanay appearance was in 1990, in a short programme called ''Andy's Scottish Filling'' which preceded the live BBC Hogmanay Show.\n\nIn 1994 Cameron joined the cast of ''[[Take the High Road]]'', the STV [[soap opera|soap]].

His act as a [[football hooligan]] led to him becoming a top comedy act in Scottish [[football (soccer)|football]] clubs. He is probably best known for writing and performing the football [[anthem]] \"[[Ally's Tartan Army]]\" for the [[Scotland national football team]]'s appearance at the [[1978 World Cup]].

Cameron promptly put all of the profits from his [[single (music)|single]] into producing an [[album]], which he hoped to release while the World Cup fever in Scotland was still going strong. He was too late - Scotland team went out of the World Cup early and Cameron's album fared equally badly. Andy also released a song in the 70's for his beloved Glasgow Rangers - 'The Greatest Team of All' - which still appears on the odd Rangers compilation album.\n\nIn 1975 he came second in ''[[New Faces]]'' leading to several appearances on variety shows such as ''Live at Her Majesty\u2019s'' with [[Jimmy Tarbuck]] and ''Tarby and Friends''.\n\nIn 1979, soon after the establishment of [[BBC Radio Scotland]], he was given a thirteen-week contract to present a programme of [[music]] and [[humour]]. The show eventually ran for fifteen years. He was voted Radio Personality of the year in 1984. He had his own series on [[BBC Scotland]] in 1979 and again in 1982. He was awarded Scottish Television Personality of the Year for his 1983 series called ''It\u2019s Andy Cameron''.\n\nIn the early 1980s he was invited to speak in debates at [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] and [[Oxford University|Oxford Universities]] alongside [[Arnold Brown (comedian)|Arnold Brown]] and [[James Naughtie]].\n\nIn 1984, Cameron presented [[STV (TV network)|STV]]'s ''[[Hogmanay]]'' show. The following year he presented the BBC Scotland Hogmanay show, and continued to do so until 1989. His last Hogmanay appearance was in 1990, in a short programme called ''Andy's Scottish Filling'' which preceded the live BBC Hogmanay Show.\n\nIn 1994 Cameron joined the cast of ''[[Take the High Road]]'', the STV [[soap opera|soap]].

Expression and affinity for IL-8 differs between the two receptors (CXCR1 > CXCR2). Through a chain of biochemical reactions, IL-8 is secreted and is an important mediator of the immune reaction in the innate immune system response.\n\n== Function ==\nIL-8, also known as ''neutrophil chemotactic factor'', has two primary functions.  It induces [[chemotaxis]] in target cells, primarily neutrophils but also other granulocytes, causing them to migrate toward the site of infection. IL-8 also stimulates phagocytosis once they have arrived.  IL-8 is also known to be a potent promoter of [[angiogenesis]]. In target cells, IL-8 induces a series of physiological responses required for migration and phagocytosis, such as increases in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, exocytosis (e.g. [[histamine]] release), and the [[respiratory burst]].\n\nIL-8 can be secreted by any cells with [[toll-like receptor]]s that are involved in the innate immune response. Usually, it is the [[macrophages]] that see an antigen first, and thus are the first cells to release IL-8 to recruit other cells. Both monomer and [[homodimer]] forms of IL-8 have been reported to be potent inducers of the chemokine receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2.  The homodimer is more potent, but [[methylation]] of Leu25 can block the activity of homodimers.\n\nIL-8 is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of [[bronchiolitis]], a common respiratory tract disease caused by viral infection.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nIL-8 is a member of the [[Chemokine#CXC chemokines|CXC chemokine family]]. The genes encoding this and the other ten members of the CXC chemokine family form a cluster in a region mapped to chromosome 4q.<ref name=\"pmid1967588\"/><ref>{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: IL8 interleukin 8| url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=3576| accessdate = }}</ref>\n\n== CXCL-8 mediated chemotaxis of the neutrophil ==\nCXCL8 is the primary [[cytokine]] involved in the recruitment of [[neutrophils]] to the site of damage or infection; in a process called [[chemotaxis]]. A number of variables are essential for the successful chemotaxis of neutrophils, including the increased expression of high affinity adhesion molecules to secure the neutrophil to the endothelium near the affected site (and is therefore not washed away into the circulatory system), and that the neutrophil can digest its way through the basement membrane and the extracellular matrix (ECM) to reach affected site. CXCL8 plays a key role in inducing the cell signalling necessary to bring about these changes.<ref name=\"Dixit_2012\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dixit N, Simon SI | title = Chemokines, selectins and intracellular calcium flux: temporal and spatial cues for leukocyte arrest | journal = Frontiers in Immunology | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 188 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22787461 | pmc = 3392659 | doi = 10.3389/fimmu.2012.00188 }}</ref>\n\nFirstly, at the site of infection [[histamine]] release causes vasodilation of the capillaries near the injured area which slows down the blood flow in the region and encourages leukocytes, such as neutrophils, to come closer to the endothelium, and away from the centre of the lumen where the rate of blood flow is highest. Once this occurs weak interactions are made between the [[selectins]] expressed on the neutrophil and endothelial cells (expression of which is also increased through the action of CXCL8 and other cytokines). On the neutrophil these are: L selectins, and on the endothelial cell: P and E selectins. This causes the \"rolling\" phase of chemotaxis.\n\nOnce the neutrophil is rolling along the endothelium, it will come into contact with a CXCL8 molecule expressed on the surface which stimulates the cell signalling pathway, mediated through a G-coupled-protein-receptor. The binding of CXCL8 to CXCR1/2 on the neutrophil stimulates the neutrophils to upregulate their expression of the [[integrin]], LFA-1, which takes part in high affinity bonding with [[ICAM-1]] receptors expressed on the endothelium. The expression and affinity of LFA-1 is significantly increased to maximise binding. This causes the neutrophil to slow down more until it is stationary. \nAnother key function of the cell signalling stimulated by CXCL8, is the initiation of the oxidative burst. This process allows the build up of proteolytic enzymes and reactive oxygen species (ROS) which are necessary to break down the ECM and basement membrane. These are released in secretory granules, along with more integrins. The release of ROS and damaging enzymes is regulated to minimise host damage, but continues to reach site of infection at which it will carry out its effector functions.<ref name=\"Dixit_2012\" />\n\n== Target cells ==\n\nWhile neutrophil granulocytes are the primary target cells of IL-8, there are a relatively wide range of cells ([[endothelial cells]], [[macrophage]]s, [[mast cell]]s, and [[keratinocyte]]s) that respond to this chemokine.

Expression and affinity for IL-8 differs between the two receptors (CXCR1 > CXCR2). Through a chain of biochemical reactions, IL-8 is secreted and is an important mediator of the immune reaction in the innate immune system response.\n\n== Function ==\nIL-8, also known as ''neutrophil chemotactic factor'', has two primary functions.  It induces [[chemotaxis]] in target cells, primarily neutrophils but also other granulocytes, causing them to migrate toward the site of infection. IL-8 also stimulates phagocytosis once they have arrived.  IL-8 is also known to be a potent promoter of [[angiogenesis]]. In target cells, IL-8 induces a series of physiological responses required for migration and phagocytosis, such as increases in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, exocytosis (e.g. [[histamine]] release), and the [[respiratory burst]].\n\nIL-8 can be secreted by any cells with [[toll-like receptor]]s that are involved in the innate immune response. Usually, it is the [[macrophages]] that see an antigen first, and thus are the first cells to release IL-8 to recruit other cells. Both monomer and [[homodimer]] forms of IL-8 have been reported to be potent inducers of the chemokine receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2.  The homodimer is more potent, but [[methylation]] of Leu25 can block the activity of homodimers.\n\nIL-8 is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of [[bronchiolitis]], a common respiratory tract disease caused by viral infection.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nIL-8 is a member of the [[Chemokine#CXC chemokines|CXC chemokine family]]. The genes encoding this and the other ten members of the CXC chemokine family form a cluster in a region mapped to chromosome 4q.<ref name=\"pmid1967588\"/><ref>{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: IL8 interleukin 8| url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=3576| accessdate = }}</ref>\n\n== CXCL-8 mediated chemotaxis of the neutrophil ==\nCXCL8 is the primary [[cytokine]] involved in the recruitment of [[neutrophils]] to the site of damage or infection; in a process called [[chemotaxis]]. A number of variables are essential for the successful chemotaxis of neutrophils, including the increased expression of high affinity adhesion molecules to secure the neutrophil to the endothelium near the affected site (and is therefore not washed away into the circulatory system), and that the neutrophil can digest its way through the basement membrane and the extracellular matrix (ECM) to reach affected site. CXCL8 plays a key role in inducing the cell signalling necessary to bring about these changes.<ref name=\"Dixit_2012\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dixit N, Simon SI | title = Chemokines, selectins and intracellular calcium flux: temporal and spatial cues for leukocyte arrest | journal = Frontiers in Immunology | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 188 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22787461 | pmc = 3392659 | doi = 10.3389/fimmu.2012.00188 }}</ref>\n\nFirstly, at the site of infection [[histamine]] release causes vasodilation of the capillaries near the injured area which slows down the blood flow in the region and encourages leukocytes, such as neutrophils, to come closer to the endothelium, and away from the centre of the lumen where the rate of blood flow is highest. Once this occurs weak interactions are made between the [[selectins]] expressed on the neutrophil and endothelial cells (expression of which is also increased through the action of CXCL8 and other cytokines). On the neutrophil these are: L selectins, and on the endothelial cell: P and E selectins. This causes the \"rolling\" phase of chemotaxis.\n\nOnce the neutrophil is rolling along the endothelium, it will come into contact with a CXCL8 molecule expressed on the surface which stimulates the cell signalling pathway, mediated through a G-coupled-protein-receptor. The binding of CXCL8 to CXCR1/2 on the neutrophil stimulates the neutrophils to upregulate their expression of the [[integrin]], LFA-1, which takes part in high affinity bonding with [[ICAM-1]] receptors expressed on the endothelium. The expression and affinity of LFA-1 is significantly increased to maximise binding. This causes the neutrophil to slow down more until it is stationary. \nAnother key function of the cell signalling stimulated by CXCL8, is the initiation of the oxidative burst. This process allows the build up of proteolytic enzymes and reactive oxygen species (ROS) which are necessary to break down the ECM and basement membrane. These are released in secretory granules, along with more integrins. The release of ROS and damaging enzymes is regulated to minimise host damage, but continues to reach site of infection at which it will carry out its effector functions.<ref name=\"Dixit_2012\" />\n\n== Target cells ==\n\nWhile neutrophil granulocytes are the primary target cells of IL-8, there are a relatively wide range of cells ([[endothelial cells]], [[macrophage]]s, [[mast cell]]s, and [[keratinocyte]]s) that respond to this chemokine.
