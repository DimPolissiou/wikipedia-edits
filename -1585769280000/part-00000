This eparchy (from the 19th century known as the Eparchy of Upper Karlovac) was the ecclesiastical centre of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] in this region, populated by Serbs, the community known at the time as \"[[Rascians]]\".\n\nThis eparchy was under jurisdiction of the Metropolitan of Dabro-Bosna, directly under the restored Serbian Patriarch in Pe\u0107 and after 1766 under the new Serbian Metropolitanate of Karlovci, comprising Lika, [[Banija]] and [[Kordun]].\n\nIn 1993 the old Cathedral Church of Saint Nicholas and the eparchy's diocesan residence were destroyed by Croatians during the [[Croatian war of Independence]].\n\n==Monasteries==\n*[[Gomirje Monastery]]\n*[[Komogovina Monastery]]\n*[[Medak Monastery]]\n*[[Gorica Monastery]]\n*[[Donji Buda\u010dki Monastery]]\n\n==Metropolitans==\n*[[Atanasije Ljubojevi\u0107]] (1688\u20141712)\n*[[Danilo Ljubotina]] (1713\u20141739)\n*[[Pavle Nenadovi\u0107]] (1744\u20141749)\n*[[Danilo Jak\u0161i\u0107]] (1751\u20141771)\n*[[Josif Stojanovi\u0107]] (1771\u20141774)\n*[[Petar Petrovi\u0107 (bishop)|Petar Petrovi\u0107]] (1774\u20141784)\n*[[Jovan Jovanovi\u0107 (bishop)|Jovan Jovanovi\u0107]] (1783\u20141786)\n*[[Genadije Dimovi\u0107]] (1786\u20141796)\n*[[Stefan Avakumovi\u0107]] (1798\u20141801)\n*[[Petar Jovanovi\u0107 Vidak]] (1801\u20141806)\n*[[Mojsije Miokovi\u0107]] (1807\u20141823)\n*[[Lukijan Mu\u0161icki]] (1828\u20141837)\n*[[Evgenije Jovanovi\u0107]] (1839\u20141854)\n*[[Sergije Ka\u0107anski]] (1858\u20141859)\n*[[Petar Jovanovi\u0107 (metropolitan)|Petar Jovanovi\u0107]] (1859\u20141864)\n*[[Lukijan Nikolajevi\u0107]] (1865\u20141872)\n*[[Teofan \u017divkovi\u0107]] (1874\u20141890)\n*[[Mihailo Gruji\u0107]] (1891\u20141914)\n*[[Ilarion Zeremski]] (1920\u20141931)\n*[[Maksimilijan Hajdin]] (1931\u20141936)\n*[[Sava Trlaji\u0107]] (1938\u20141941)\n*[[Nikanor Ili\u010di\u0107]] (1947\u20141951)\n*[[Simeon Zlokovi\u0107]] (1951\u20141990)\n*[[Nikanor Bogunovi\u0107]] (1991\u20141999)\n*[[Fotije Sladojevi\u0107]] (2000\u20142004)\n*[[Gerasim Popovi\u0107]] (2004\u2014).\n\n==See also==\n* [[Serbs of Croatia]]\n* [[Eastern Orthodoxy in Croatia]]\n* [[List of the Eparchies of the Serbian Orthodox Church]]\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last=\u0106irkovi\u0107|first=Sima|authorlink=Sima \u0106irkovi\u0107|year=2004|title=The Serbs|location=Malden|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Wc-DWRzoeIC}}\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Mileusni\u0107|first=Slobodan|title=Spiritual Genocide: A survey of destroyed, damaged and desecrated churches, monasteries and other church buildings during the war 1991-1995 (1997)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_TaPAAAAMAAJ|year=1997|location=Belgrade|publisher=Museum of the Serbian Orthodox Church}}\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Miller|first=Nicholas J.|title=Between Nation and State: Serbian Politics in Croatia Before the First World War|year=1997|location=Pittsburgh|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|url=https://archive.org/details/betweennationsta00mill_0|url-access=registration}}\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last=\u0412\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b|first=\u0421\u0430\u0432\u0430|year=1996|title=\u0421\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0458\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0438 \u043e\u0434 \u0434\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0433 \u0434\u043e \u0434\u0432\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0441\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0433 \u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430 (Serbian Hierarchs from the 9th to the 20th Century)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VBzkAAAAMAAJ|publisher=\u0415\u0432\u0440\u043e, \u0423\u043d\u0438\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0441, \u041a\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u045b}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.eparhija-gornjokarlovacka.hr/ Official website]\n*[http://www.spc.rs/Genocid/Gornjokarlovacka/gornjoe.html The diocese of Upper Karlovac - history and destruction in war]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n* [http://www.rastko.rs/istorija/srbi-balkan/jilic-croatia.html The Serbs in the Former SR of Croatia]\n\n{{Serbian Orthodox subdivisions}}\n{{Serbian minority institutions and organizations in Croatia}}\n{{Serbian Orthodox Church in Croatia}}\n\n[[Category:Serbian Orthodox Church in Croatia]]\n[[Category:Religious organizations established in the 1690s]]\n[[Category:Dioceses established in the 17th century]]\n[[Category:Religious sees of the Serbian Orthodox Church]]\n[[Category:Serbian minority institutions and organizations in Croatia]]\n[[Category:1695 establishments in Europe]]\n[[Category:17th-century establishments in Croatia]]\n\n{{Orthodoxy-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Lhtaylor2020", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eparchy_of_Gornji_Karlovac"}

The supply contract was signed in November 1999 with [[Motorola]] as the radio provider alongside Thales. Citylink's shareholders are [[Thales Group]] (33 per cent), [[Fluor Corporation]] (18%), [[Motorola]] (10%), Laing Investment (19.5%) and [[HSBC]] (19.5%). The cost of the design, build and maintain contract was \u00a32&nbsp;billion over twenty years.<br />Various subcontractors were used for the installation work, including Brookvex and Fentons.\n\nA key reasoning for the introduction of the system was in light of the [[King's Cross fire]] disaster, where efforts by the emergency services were hampered by a lack of radio coverage below ground. Work was due to be completed by the end of 2002, although suffered delays due to the necessity of installing the required equipment on an ageing railway infrastructure with no disruption to the operational railway. On 5 June 2006 the [[London Assembly]] published the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|7 July Review Committee]] report, which urged TfL to speed up implementation of the Connect system.<ref name=REGISTER />\n\nThe [[East London line]] was chosen as the first line to receive the TETRA radio in February 2006, as it was the second smallest line and is a mix of surface and sub surface.

Buses and trams share a common fare and ticketing regime, and the DLR, Overground, Underground, and National Rail services another.\n\n===Zonal fare system===\n{{main|London fare zones}}\nRail service fares in the capital are calculated by a zonal fare system. London is divided into [[London fare zones|eleven fare zones]], with every station on the [[London Underground]], [[London Overground]], [[Docklands Light Railway]] and, since 2007, on National Rail services, being in one, or in some cases, two zones. The zones are mostly concentric rings of increasing size emanating from the centre of London. They are (in order):\n\n*[[List of stations in London fare zone 1|Zone 1]]\n*[[List of stations in London fare zone 2|Zone 2]]\n*[[List of stations in London fare zone 3|Zone 3]]\n*[[List of stations in London fare zone 4|Zone 4]]\n*[[List of stations in London fare zone 5|Zone 5]]\n*[[List of stations in London fare zone 6|Zone 6]]\n*[[List of stations in London fare zones 7\u2013W|Zones 7\u20139, C, G and W]]\n\n===Travelcard===\n{{Main|Travelcard}}\nSuperimposed on these mode-specific regimes is the [[Travelcard]] system, which provides zonal tickets with validities from one day to one year, and off-peak variants. These are accepted on the DLR, buses, railways, trams, and the Underground, and provide a discount on many river services fares.\n\n===Oyster card===\n{{Main|Oyster card}}\nThe [[Oyster card]] is a [[contactless smart card]] system introduced for the public in 2003, which can be used to pay individual fares (pay as you go) or to carry various Travelcards and other passes. It is used by scanning the card at a yellow card reader. Such readers are found on ticket gates where otherwise a paper ticket could be fed through, allowing the gate to open and the passenger to walk through, and on stand-alone Oyster validators, which do not operate a barrier. Since 2010, Oyster Pay as you go has been available on all [[National Rail]] services within London. Oyster Pay as you go has a set of daily maximum charges that are the same as buying the nearest equivalent Day Travelcard.\n\n===Contactless payments===\n{{Main|Contactless payments}}\nContactless Visa, Maestro, MasterCard and American Express debit and credit cards issued in the UK are accepted for travel on London Underground, London Overground, Docklands Light Railway, most National Rail, London Tramlink and Bus services. This works in the same way for the passenger as an [[Oyster card]], including the use of capping and reduced fares compared to paper tickets.

The roundel rendered in blue without any lettering represents TfL as a whole (see Transport for London logo), as well as used in situations where lettering on the roundel is not possible (such as bus receipts, where a logo is a blank roundel with the name \"London Buses\" to the right). The same range of colours is also used extensively in publicity and on the TfL website.\n\nTransport for London has always mounted advertising campaigns to encourage use of the Underground. For example, in 1999, they commissioned artist [[Stephen Whatley]] to paint an interior \u2013 'The Grand Staircase' \u2013 which he did on location inside Buckingham Palace. This painting was reproduced on posters and displayed all over the London Underground.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ltmcollection.org/posters/artist/artist.html?IXartist=Stephen%20B%20Whatley|title=Artist: Stephen B Whatley \u2013 Poster and poster artwork collection, London Transport Museum|first=London Transport Museum, 39 Wellington Street, Covent Garden, London WC2E 7BB|last=enquiry@ltmuseum.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010 they commissioned artist Mark Wallinger to assist them in celebrating the 150th anniversary of the Underground, by creating the Labyrinth Project, with one painting to hang permanently in each of the Tube's 270 stations.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tube celebrates 150th birthday with labyrinth art project |author=Mark Brown |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/feb/07/tube-150-birthday-labyrinth-art-project |newspaper=The Guardian |date=7 February 2013 |accessdate=7 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, in partnership with the [[London Transport Museum]] and sponsored by [[Exterion Media]],<ref name=\"exterionmedia.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.exterionmedia.com/uk/who-we-are/news/exterion-media-sponsors-tfls-transported-by-design-programme/|title=Exterion Media sponsors TfL|date=17 September 2015|access-date=7 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304190036/http://www.exterionmedia.com/uk/who-we-are/news/exterion-media-sponsors-tfls-transported-by-design-programme/|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"exterionmedia.com\"/> TfL launched [[Transported by Design]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tfl.gov.uk/campaign/transported-by-design|title=Transported by Design|author=Transport for London|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417060006/https://tfl.gov.uk/campaign/transported-by-design|archivedate=17 April 2016}}</ref> an 18-month programme of activities.

The supply contract was signed in November 1999 with [[Motorola]] as the radio provider alongside Thales. Citylink's shareholders are [[Thales Group]] (33 per cent), [[Fluor Corporation]] (18%), [[Motorola]] (10%), Laing Investment (19.5%) and [[HSBC]] (19.5%). The cost of the design, build and maintain contract was \u00a32&nbsp;billion over twenty years.<br />Various subcontractors were used for the installation work, including Brookvex and Fentons.\n\nA key reasoning for the introduction of the system was in light of the [[King's Cross fire]] disaster, where efforts by the emergency services were hampered by a lack of radio coverage below ground. Work was due to be completed by the end of 2002, although suffered delays due to the necessity of installing the required equipment on an ageing railway infrastructure with no disruption to the operational railway. On 5 June 2006 the [[London Assembly]] published the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|7 July Review Committee]] report, which urged TfL to speed up implementation of the Connect system.<ref name=REGISTER />\n\nThe [[East London line]] was chosen as the first line to receive the TETRA radio in February 2006, as it was the second smallest line and is a mix of surface and sub surface.

Buses and trams share a common fare and ticketing regime, and the DLR, Overground, Underground, and National Rail services another.\n\n===Zonal fare system===\n{{main|London fare zones}}\nRail service fares in the capital are calculated by a zonal fare system. London is divided into [[London fare zones|eleven fare zones]], with every station on the [[London Underground]], [[London Overground]], [[Docklands Light Railway]] and, since 2007, on National Rail services, being in one, or in some cases, two zones. The zones are mostly concentric rings of increasing size emanating from the centre of London. They are (in order):\n\n*[[List of stations in London fare zone 1|Zone 1]]\n*[[List of stations in London fare zone 2|Zone 2]]\n*[[List of stations in London fare zone 3|Zone 3]]\n*[[List of stations in London fare zone 4|Zone 4]]\n*[[List of stations in London fare zone 5|Zone 5]]\n*[[List of stations in London fare zone 6|Zone 6]]\n*[[List of stations in London fare zones 7\u2013W|Zones 7\u20139, C, G and W]]\n\n===Travelcard===\n{{Main|Travelcard}}\nSuperimposed on these mode-specific regimes is the [[Travelcard]] system, which provides zonal tickets with validities from one day to one year, and off-peak variants. These are accepted on the DLR, buses, railways, trams, and the Underground, and provide a discount on many river services fares.\n\n===Oyster card===\n{{Main|Oyster card}}\nThe [[Oyster card]] is a [[contactless smart card]] system introduced for the public in 2003, which can be used to pay individual fares (pay as you go) or to carry various Travelcards and other passes. It is used by scanning the card at a yellow card reader. Such readers are found on ticket gates where otherwise a paper ticket could be fed through, allowing the gate to open and the passenger to walk through, and on stand-alone Oyster validators, which do not operate a barrier. Since 2010, Oyster Pay as you go has been available on all [[National Rail]] services within London. Oyster Pay as you go has a set of daily maximum charges that are the same as buying the nearest equivalent Day Travelcard.\n\n===Contactless payments===\n{{Main|Contactless payments}}\nContactless Visa, Maestro, MasterCard and American Express debit and credit cards issued in the UK are accepted for travel on London Underground, London Overground, Docklands Light Railway, most National Rail, London Tramlink and Bus services. This works in the same way for the passenger as an [[Oyster card]], including the use of capping and reduced fares compared to paper tickets.

The roundel rendered in blue without any lettering represents TfL as a whole (see Transport for London logo), as well as used in situations where lettering on the roundel is not possible (such as bus receipts, where a logo is a blank roundel with the name \"London Buses\" to the right). The same range of colours is also used extensively in publicity and on the TfL website.\n\nTransport for London has always mounted advertising campaigns to encourage use of the Underground. For example, in 1999, they commissioned artist [[Stephen Whatley]] to paint an interior \u2013 'The Grand Staircase' \u2013 which he did on location inside Buckingham Palace.

The purpose of a towpath is to allow a land [[vehicle]], beasts of burden, or a team of human pullers to tow a [[boat]], often a [[barge]]. This mode of transport was common where [[sailing]] was impractical due to tunnels and bridges, unfavourable [[wind]]s, or the narrowness of the channel.\n\nAfter the [[Industrial Revolution]], towing became obsolete when engines were fitted on boats and when railway transportation superseded the slow towing method. Since then, many of these towpaths have been converted to [[Multi-use trail#Multi-use trails|multi-use trail]]s. They are still named towpaths \u2014 although they are now only occasionally used for the purpose of towing boats.\n\n==History==\nEarly inland waterway transport used the rivers, and while barges could use sails to assist their passage when winds were favourable or the river was wide enough to allow tacking, in many cases this was not possible, and gangs of men were used to bow-haul the boats. As river banks were often privately owned, such teams worked their way along the river banks as best they could, but this was far from satisfactory. On British rivers such as the [[River Severn]], the situation was improved by the creation of towing path companies in the late 1700s. The companies built towing paths along the banks of the river, and four such companies improved a section of {{convert|24|mi|km}} in this way between [[Bewdley]] and [[Coalbrookdale]]. They were not universally popular, however, as tolls were charged for their use, to recoup the capital cost, and this was resented on rivers where barge traffic had previously been free.<ref name=mcknight22>{{harvnb |McKnight |1981 |p=22}}</ref>\n\nWith the advent of artificial canals, most of them were constructed with towpaths suitable for horses.<ref>{{harvnb |McKnight |1981 |pp=129\u2013130}}</ref> Many rivers were improved by artificial cuts, and this often gave an opportunity to construct a towing path at the same time. Even so, the [[River Don Navigation]] was improved from [[Tinsley, South Yorkshire|Tinsley]] to [[Rotherham]] in 1751, but the horse towing path was not completed on this section until 1822.<ref>{{harvnb |Hadfield |1972 |pp=73, 211}}</ref> On the [[River Avon, Warwickshire|River Avon]] between [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] and [[Tewkesbury]], a towpath was never provided, and bow-hauling continued until the 1860s, when steam tugs were introduced.<ref>{{harvnb |McKnight |1981 |p=130}}</ref>\n\nWhile towing paths were most convenient when they stayed on one side of a canal, there were occasions where it had to change sides, often because of opposition from landowners. Thus the towpath on the [[Chesterfield Canal]] changes to the south bank while it passes through the Osberton Estate, as the Foljambes, who lived in Osberton Hall, did not want boatmen passing too close to their residence.<ref>{{harvnb |Roffey |1989 |p=108}}</ref> On canals, one solution to the problem of getting the horse to the other side was the [[roving bridge]] or turnover bridge, where the horse ascended the ramp on one side, crossed the bridge, descended a circular ramp on the other side of the river but the same side of the bridge, and then passed through the bridge hole to continue on its way. This had the benefit that the rope did not have to be detached while the transfer took place.<ref>{{harvnb |McKnight |1981 |p=60}}</ref> Where the towpath reached a lock, which was spanned by a footbridge at its tail, the southern section of the [[Stratford-on-Avon Canal]] used split bridges so that the horse line did not have to be detached. The rope passed through a small gap at the centre of the bridge between its two halves.<ref name=\"McKnight 1981 59\">{{harvnb |McKnight |1981 |p=59}}</ref>\n\n[[file:Rope_burns_on_stop_gate_bridge_abutment_above_Lock_16_on_Chesapeake_and_Ohio_Canal.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Example of Rope abrasion, on a bridge (which also functions as a stop gate) on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal]]\nOne problem with the horse towing path where it passed under a bridge was abrasion of the rope on the bridge arch. This resulted in deep grooves being cut in the fabric of the bridge, and in many cases, the structure was protected by [[cast iron]] plates, attached to the faces of the arch. These too soon developed deep grooves, but could be more easily replaced than the stonework of the bridge.<ref name=\"McKnight 1981 59\"/> While bridges could be constructed over relatively narrow canals, they were more costly on wide navigable rivers, and in many cases horse ferries were provided, to enable the horse to reach the next stretch of towpath. In more recent times, this has provided difficulties for walkers, where an attractive river-side walk cannot be followed because the towpath changes sides and the ferry is no more.<ref name=mcknight22/>\n\nNot all haulage was by horses, and an experiment was carried out on the [[Middlewich Branch]] of the [[Shropshire Union Canal]] in 1888. Following suggestions by Francis W. Webb, the Mechanical Engineer for the [[London and North Western Railway]] at [[Crewe Works]], rails were laid along a {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch of the towpath near Worleston, and a small steam locomotive borrowed from Crewe Works was used to tow boats. The locomotive ran on {{RailGauge|18in}} gauge tracks, and was similar to [[List of rolling stock items in the UK National Collection|''Pet'']], which is preserved in the [[National Railway Museum]] at [[York]]. It pulled trains of two and four boats at {{convert|7|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}, and experiments were also tried with eight boats. The canal's engineer, G. R. Webb, produced a report on the expected costs of laying rails along the towpaths, but nothing more was heard of the project,<ref>{{harvnb |Hadfield |1985 |pp=241\u2013242}}</ref> and the advent of steam and diesel powered boats offered a much simpler solution. The '[[Panama Canal Locks#Mules|mules]]' which assist ships through the locks of the [[Panama Canal]] are a modern example of the concept.\n\n==Modern Usage==\nTowpaths are popular with [[cyclists]] and walkers, and some are suitable for [[equestrianism|equestrians]]. In snowy winters they are popular in the US with [[cross-country ski]]ers and [[snowmobile]] users.\n\nAlthough historically not designed or used as towpaths, [[acequia]] ditch banks also are popular recreational trails.\n\n===Britain===\nIn Britain, most canals were built, owned and operated by private companies, and the towpaths were deemed to be private, for the benefit of legitimate users of the canal. The [[History of the British canal system#20th century nationalisation|nationalisation of the canal system]] in 1948 did not result in the towpaths becoming [[public rights of way]]. Subsequent legislation, such as the [[Transport Act 1968#Waterways|Transport Act 1968]], which defined the government's obligations to the maintenance of the inland waterways for which it was now responsible, did not include any commitment to maintain towpaths for use by anyone,<ref name=screen>{{cite web |url=http://www.waterways.org.uk/pdf/restoration/leisure_facilities_on_the_towpath |first=Andy |last=Screen |title=Leisure Facilities on the Towpath |publisher=Inland Waterways Association |accessdate=2012-02-03}}</ref> however, some ten years later [[British Waterways]] started to relax the rule that a permit was required to give access to a towpath, and began to encourage leisure usage by walkers, anglers and in some areas, cyclists.<ref>{{harvnb |Cumberlidge |2009 |p=37}}</ref> The steady development of the leisure use of the canals and the decline of commercial traffic has resulted in a general acceptance that towpaths are open to everyone, and not just boat users.<ref name=jane11>{{harvnb |Cumberlidge |2009 |p=11}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of free access to towpaths is now enshrined in the legislation which transferred responsibility for the English and Welsh canals from [[British Waterways]] to the [[Canal & River Trust]] in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2011/09/12/waterways-charity-2/ |title=Government confirms commitment to create new charity to protect Britain's waterways |publisher=DEFRA |accessdate=2012-02-03}}</ref> Cycling permits are no longer required by the Canal & River Trust.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cycling FAQs|url=https://canalrivertrust.org.uk/enjoy-the-waterways/cycling/cycling-faqs|publisher=Canal & River Trust|accessdate=21 August 2017}}</ref> However, not all canal towpaths are suitable for use by cyclists, and conflicts can arise between the differing user groups.

{"title_page": "Tournament of Tottenham", "text_new": "'''The Tournament of Tottenham''' is a short humorous [[poem]] of 231 lines written in [[Middle English]] and is dated between 1400\u201340. There are two known manuscripts for the poem, one Harleian 5306 (H), 1456 in the [[British Library]] and the other Ff. II 38 (c), 1431 in the [[Cambridge University Library]]. The dialect has been identified as [[Northern England English|Northern English]]. The line is [[alliterative]], either emulating or parodying older Germanic metrical styles. The author is unknown.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story is set in [[Tottenham]], at that time a rural community north of [[London]].\n\nDuring a drinking fest, Perkyn (a potter) boasts to Rondal, the local [[Reeve (England)|reeve]], that he is the most worthy among the men to marry Tyb, Rondal's attractive daughter.  The boast brings about responses from the others, who equally boast of their worthiness, whereupon Perkyn challenges anyone to a [[joust]] to settle the issue.  Rondal elects to settle the matter by agreeing with Perkyn's idea of a joust, and schedules a jousting tournament to be held seven days later, open to any and all potential suitors.  The winner of the tournament will be granted Tyb's hand in marriage (subject to her assent) as well as a \"[[dowry]]\" (the first of several humorous elements of the joust; it consists of one old gray mare and one spotted sow).\n\nAt the tournament, the suitors arrive riding old mares as horses, brandishing farm implements for jousting lances, and wearing bowls and pottery as [[armor]].  Tyb arrives at the tournament and watches the proceedings on a mare, with a feather-filled bag for a saddle and a hen on her lap.  After each worker makes his overblown boast of bravery (Perkyn going last), the \"tournament\" commences.\n\nNotwithstanding the lack of professional jousting attire, the participants engage in a lively battle which results in several serious injuries and one attempt (by \"Tyrry\") to prematurely end the battle by abducting Tyb (his attempt is stopped by Perkyn).  At the end of the tournament, the women of Tottenham and the nearby communities arrive to drag them home.  Perkyn ends up being the last combatant standing and is thus declared the winner and given Tyb.  After they spend the night together, she agrees the next day to marry him.\n\nUpon the announcement of the marriage, the warriors gather for a feast. (The feast is described in more detail in another shorter poem, \"The Feast of Tottenham\", the author of which is unknown, but it is believed that both poems were written by the same person.)\n\n==Criticism==\nThe poem is evidently meant to be humorous, as the weapons are totally unsuited to war; the combatants fight with farm tools on old horses more given to passing wind than battle. The martial seriousness of the men's vows is immediately undermined by comic touches such as the banners made from old hides and a trumpet made of wood, fighting for a dowry of an old horse and a spotted pig. The poem does not explain why some of the warriors are fighting for Tyb's hand in marriage when they currently have wives (who arrive to drag home their injured men in wheelbarrows).\n\nCritics do not agree on the subject of or audience for the parody. The poem may be satirizing knightly conventions such as the jousting tournament, or it may be mocking the country bumpkins who try to imitate these courtly rituals. Or, as with [[Chaucer]]'s [[Reeve's Tale]], the poet may be making fun of speakers of northern English, who were often stereotyped by southerners as backward.\n\n==External links==\n* http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/teams/ekttfrm.htm Text of The Tournament of Tottenham\n* http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/teams/ekftfrm.htm Text of The Feast of Tottenham\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tournament Of Tottenham}}\n[[Category:15th-century poems]]\n[[Category:Middle English poems]]\n[[Category:Humorous poems]]\n[[Category:Mock-heroic English poems]]\n", "text_old": "'''The Tournament of Tottenham''' is a short humorous [[poem]] of 231 lines written in [[Middle English]] and is dated between 1400-40.

In 1991, he was sentenced to 3 and a half years in jail due to involvement in a gang shooting, although this was reduced a year. In 1995, police intelligence reports indicated he had been fraternizing with gang members from [[Brent, London|Brent]] and [[Notting Hill]]. He also had a feud with Jerome Maddix, who had experienced a drive-by shooting at his home. He was murdered a year later in Jamaica.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn 1996, police believed Mark and an associate, Clifford Angol, may have been involved in the non-fatal shooting of Kenneth Wowe in West London. The following year, three gunmen entered a Caribbean restaurant in West London called The Place To Be and asked to see Mark. While it is suspected Mark Lambie was there at the time, he kept quiet if he was. Instead two innocent Marks were shot after identifying themselves.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Police suspected this may have been an attempted retaliation shooting following the shooting of Kenneth Wowe. Six months later, Kenneth Wowe was shot dead. Mark and Clifford were promptly arrested, but let go due to lack of evidence.

The victim named Mark Lambie as the shooter, who was then arrested, but once again was let go after the victim withdrew his evidence. In the same year, police believed he and an associate, Michael Thomas (aka Mallet), had shot at an EQ nightclub in Hackney Marsh. Police suspected this was a form of blackmail. There was a third incident at a Hackney club where Stephen Grant was shot dead. Police suspected this was a part of the TMD and Hackney Boys dispute. Lambie was suspected of being at the club.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== 2000\u20132002: Fall of Mark Lambie ===\nBy 2000, Mark Lambie was considered untouchable by the local black community.

Instead police used similar tactics American police used when going after [[Al Capone]], by going after his associates. Police also found that Mark was living in South London, rather than North as was expected, and that he was using false names, such as 'Paul Gordan'. Eventually they managed to find him and his brother, Wesley Lambie, in a car that was suspected to be stolen (although the owner refused to testify it was). They also found heroin in the car, but were unable to link it to the Lambie brothers. Although they were unable to bring charges, knowing where he was made surveillance now a possibility.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn 2002, Mark Lambie, along with Anthony \"Blue\" Bourne (member of the North London gang \"The Firm\"), were jailed after the kidnapping, blackmailing, and torture of two men, Mr. Smith and Mr. Morris, from Tottenham on April 21, 2001. The police had been following Lambie around Tottenham on the day, and saw him enter and leave Broadwater Estate. It was considered too risky to enter the Estate, so they waited outside until Mark left, and followed him to a party. Nothing eventful happened, so they returned to the police station.<ref name=\":3\" /> What they didn't know, is that an associate of Mark, Anthony Bourne, had lured two men into Broadwater Estate, where they were kidnapped at gunpoint by at least 14 people. The two men had driven a blue sports car into the estate, which the police had spotted earlier as they were following Mark. The group took the two men into a house, which they burst into and ordered the current occupants (two women and two children) to move downstairs, and then began to torture the two men, demanding money from them both. The house they had entered was the same house the police had seen Mark enter earlier in the day, which the police had interpreted to be a party.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\"beeb1\" /><ref name=\"gruniad\" /><ref name=\":10\" />\n\nThey were hit with hammers, burned with an electric iron, and had boiling water poured onto their genitals. One of the victims, Mr. Smith, was able to escape after suggesting there was money at a nearby salon. He was bundled into a car, and driven to the salon, which was promptly robbed while the Mr. Smith was secured in the boot of the car. While the suspects were inside the salon, Mr. Smith was able to escape from the car and ran to the nearby police station. After his escape, the gang began to flee. They took Mr. Morris outside but were seen by a passing police car. The gang fled, and Mr. Morris ran towards a police car he had spotted passing by and lunged onto the bonnet asking for help.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/1978157.stm|title='Malign and corrosive' gangsters|date=2002-05-17|access-date=2019-08-07|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190807132737/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/1978157.stm|archive-date=7 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"beeb1\" /><ref name=\"gruniad\" /><ref name=\":10\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MikCDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT390&lpg=PT390&dq=%22mark-lambie%22+%22man-dem%22&source=bl&ots=BVEUhdd_0N&sig=ACfU3U2vt1D__Lbpx4HQEVJll27-eczRwQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjM2v6wjfDjAhUTonEKHc_aD_cQ6AEwHHoECDcQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22mark-lambie%22%20%22man-dem%22&f=false|title=Blood on the Page: WINNER of the 2018 Gold Dagger Award for Non-Fiction|last=Harding|first=Thomas|date=2018-01-25|publisher=Random House|isbn=9781473537958|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nTwo other members of the gang that were involved in the incident, Warren Leader and Francis Osei, were also convicted of kidnapping and blackmail.<ref name=\"beeb1\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> Warren Leader was released in 2009, but in 2013 he was jailed for 16 years for running a heroin factory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/yardie-gangster-who-ran-heroin-factory-jailed-for-16-years-8746168.html|title=Yardie gangster who ran heroin factory jailed for 16 years|date=2013-08-05|website=Evening Standard|language=en|access-date=2019-08-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190807132755/https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/yardie-gangster-who-ran-heroin-factory-jailed-for-16-years-8746168.html|archive-date=7 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2003, Gavin Smith was killed in [[Lordship Recreation Ground]].

In 1991, he was sentenced to 3 and a half years in jail due to involvement in a gang shooting, although this was reduced a year. In 1995, police intelligence reports indicated he had been fraternizing with gang members from [[Brent, London|Brent]] and [[Notting Hill]]. He also had a feud with Jerome Maddix, who had experienced a drive-by shooting at his home. He was murdered a year later in Jamaica.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn 1996, police believed Mark and an associate, Clifford Angol, may have been involved in the non-fatal shooting of Kenneth Wowe in West London. The following year, three gunmen entered a Caribbean restaurant in West London called The Place To Be and asked to see Mark. While it is suspected Mark Lambie was there at the time, he kept quiet if he was. Instead two innocent Marks were shot after identifying themselves.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Police suspected this may have been an attempted retaliation shooting following the shooting of Kenneth Wowe. Six months later, Kenneth Wowe was shot dead. Mark and Clifford were promptly arrested, but let go due to lack of evidence.

The victim named Mark Lambie as the shooter, who was then arrested, but once again was let go after the victim withdrew his evidence. In the same year, police believed he and an associate, Michael Thomas (aka Mallet), had shot at an EQ nightclub in Hackney Marsh. Police suspected this was a form of blackmail. There was a third incident at a Hackney club where Stephen Grant was shot dead. Police suspected this was a part of the TMD and Hackney Boys dispute. Lambie was suspected of being at the club.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== 2000\u20132002: Fall of Mark Lambie ===\nBy 2000, Mark Lambie was considered untouchable by the local black community. Some people in the local community believed he was capable of [[juju]] powers and was untouchable due to magic.

Instead police used similar tactics American police used when going after [[Al Capone]], by going after his associates. Police also found that Mark was living in South London, rather than North as was expected, and that he was using false names, such as 'Paul Gordan'. Eventually they managed to find him and his brother, Wesley Lambie, in a car that was suspected to be stolen (although the owner refused to testify it was). They also found heroin in the car, but were unable to link it to the Lambie brothers. Although they were unable to bring charges, knowing where he was made surveillance now a possibility.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn 2002, Mark Lambie, along with Anthony \"Blue\" Bourne (member of the North London gang \"The Firm\"), were jailed after the kidnapping, blackmailing, and torture of two men, Mr. Smith and Mr. Morris, from Tottenham on April 21, 2001. The police had been following Lambie around Tottenham on the day, and saw him enter and leave Broadwater Estate. It was considered too risky to enter the Estate, so they waited outside until Mark left, and followed him to a party. Nothing eventful happened, so they returned to the police station.<ref name=\":3\" /> What they didn't know, is that an associate of Mark, Anthony Bourne, had lured two men into Broadwater Estate, where they were kidnapped at gunpoint by at least 14 people. The two men had driven a blue sports car into the estate, which the police had spotted earlier as they were following Mark. The group took the two men into a house, which they burst into and ordered the current occupants (two women and two children) to move downstairs, and then began to torture the two men, demanding money from them both. The house they had entered was the same house the police had seen Mark enter earlier in the day, which the police had interpreted to be a party.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\"beeb1\" /><ref name=\"gruniad\" /><ref name=\":10\" />\n\nThey were hit with hammers, burned with an electric iron, and had boiling water poured onto their genitals. One of the victims, Mr. Smith, was able to escape after suggesting there was money at a nearby salon. He was bundled into a car, and driven to the salon, which was promptly robbed while the Mr. Smith was secured in the boot of the car. While the suspects were inside the salon, Mr. Smith was able to escape from the car and ran to the nearby police station. After his escape, the gang began to flee. They took Mr. Morris outside but were seen by a passing police car. The gang fled, and Mr. Morris ran towards a police car he had spotted passing by and lunged onto the bonnet asking for help.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/1978157.stm|title='Malign and corrosive' gangsters|date=2002-05-17|access-date=2019-08-07|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190807132737/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/1978157.stm|archive-date=7 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"beeb1\" /><ref name=\"gruniad\" /><ref name=\":10\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MikCDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT390&lpg=PT390&dq=%22mark-lambie%22+%22man-dem%22&source=bl&ots=BVEUhdd_0N&sig=ACfU3U2vt1D__Lbpx4HQEVJll27-eczRwQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjM2v6wjfDjAhUTonEKHc_aD_cQ6AEwHHoECDcQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22mark-lambie%22%20%22man-dem%22&f=false|title=Blood on the Page: WINNER of the 2018 Gold Dagger Award for Non-Fiction|last=Harding|first=Thomas|date=2018-01-25|publisher=Random House|isbn=9781473537958|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nTwo other members of the gang that were involved in the incident, Warren Leader and Francis Osei, were also convicted of kidnapping and blackmail.<ref name=\"beeb1\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> Warren Leader was released in 2009, but in 2013 he was jailed for 16 years for running a heroin factory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/yardie-gangster-who-ran-heroin-factory-jailed-for-16-years-8746168.html|title=Yardie gangster who ran heroin factory jailed for 16 years|date=2013-08-05|website=Evening Standard|language=en|access-date=2019-08-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190807132755/https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/yardie-gangster-who-ran-heroin-factory-jailed-for-16-years-8746168.html|archive-date=7 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2003, Gavin Smith was killed in [[Lordship Recreation Ground]].

It also works for overall economic growth of the country. The preamble of the Reserve Bank of India describes its main functions as:<blockquote>'''''..to regulate the issue of Bank Notes and keeping of reserves with a view to securing monetary stability in India and generally to operate the currency and credit system of the country to its advantage.'''''</blockquote>\n\n===Financial supervision===\nThe primary objective of RBI is to undertake consolidated supervision of the financial sector comprising commercial banks, financial institutions, and non-banking finance companies.\n\nThe board is constituted by co-opting four directors from the Central Board as members for a term of two years and is chaired by the governor. The deputy governors of the reserve bank are ex-officio members. One deputy governor, usually the deputy governor in charge of banking regulation and supervision, is nominated as the vice-chairman of the board. The board is required to meet normally once every month. It considers inspection reports and other supervisory issues placed before it by the supervisory departments.\n\nBFS through the Audit Sub-Committee also aims at upgrading the quality of the statutory audit and internal audit functions in banks and financial institutions. The audit sub-committee includes deputy governor as the chairman and two directors of the Central Board as members. The BFS oversees the functioning of the Department of Banking Supervision (DBS), the Department of Non-Banking Supervision (DNBS) and the Financial Institutions Division (FID) and gives directions on the regulatory and supervisory issues.\n\n===Regulator and supervisor of the financial system===\nThe institution is also the regulator and supervisor of the financial system and prescribes broad parameters of banking operations within which the country's banking and financial system functions. Its objectives are to maintain public confidence in the system, protect depositors' interest and provide cost-effective banking services to the public. The ''Banking Ombudsman Scheme'' has been formulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for effective addressing of complaints by bank customers. The RBI controls the monetary supply, monitors economic indicators like the [[gross domestic product]] and has to decide the design of the rupee banknotes as well as coins.<ref name=\"RBI1\">[http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FAQView.aspx?Id=39 RBI, Frequently Asked Questions, Currency Matters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112123135/http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FAQView.aspx?Id=39 |date=12 January 2012 }} (RBI)</ref>\n\n===Regulator and supervisor of the payment and settlement systems===\nPayment and settlement systems play an important role in improving overall economic efficiency.

In this role, the RBI focuses on the development and functioning of safe, secure and efficient payment and settlement mechanisms. Two payment systems [[National Electronic Fund Transfer]] (NEFT) and Real-Time Gross Settlement ([[real-time gross settlement|RTGS]]) allow individuals, companies and firms to transfer funds from one bank to another. These facilities can only be used for transferring money within the country.\n\nNEFT operates on a deferred net settlement (DNS) basis and settles transactions in batches. The settlement takes place for all transactions received until a particular cut-off time. It operates in hourly batches \u2014 there are twelve settlements from 8&nbsp;am to 7&nbsp;pm on weekdays and six between 8&nbsp;am and 1&nbsp;pm on Saturdays.<ref>[http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FAQView.aspx?Id=60 Frequently Asked Questions]. rbi.org.in (24 November 2017)</ref> Any transaction initiated after the designated time would have to wait until the next settlement time. In RTGS, transactions are processed continuously, all through the business hours. RBI's settlement time is 9&nbsp;am to 4:30&nbsp;pm on weekdays and 9&nbsp;am to 2&nbsp;pm on Saturdays.<ref>[http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FAQView.aspx?Id=65 Frequently Asked Questions]. rbi.org.in (10 December 2018)</ref>\n\n===Banker and debt manager to government===\nJust as individuals need a bank to carry out their financial transactions effectively and efficiently, governments also need a bank to carry out their financial transactions. The RBI serves this purpose for the Government of India (GoI). As a banker to the GoI, the RBI maintains its accounts, receive payments into and make payments out of these accounts. The RBI also helps the GoI to raise money from the public via issuing bonds and government-approved securities. In Sep 2019, a decision at RBI directors meet was taken to change the RBI financial accounting year to March\u2013April to align itself with the central government calendar instead of the current June\u2013July year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/finance/after-nearly-8-decades-rbi-to-change-its-accounting-year-to-april-march-119082700038_1.html|title=After nearly 8 decades, RBI to change its accounting year to April\u2013March|last=Jha|first=Somesh|date=27 August 2019|work=Business Standard India|access-date=3 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Managing foreign exchange===\nThe central bank manages to reach different goals of the ''[[Foreign Exchange Management Act|Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999]]''. Their objective is to facilitate external trade and payment and promote orderly development and maintenance of foreign exchange market in India.\n\nWith the increasing integration of the Indian economy with the global economy arising from greater trade and capital flows, the [[foreign exchange market]] has evolved as a key segment of the Indian financial market and the RBI has an important role to play in regulating and managing this segment. The RBI manages forex and gold reserves of the nation.\n\nOn a given day, the foreign exchange rate reflects the demand for and supply of foreign exchange arising from trade and capital transactions. The RBI's Financial Markets Department (FMD) participates in the foreign exchange market by undertaking sales/purchases of foreign currency to ease volatility in periods of excess demand for/supply of foreign currency.\n\n===Issue of currency===\nOther than the Government of India, the Reserve Bank of India is the sole body authorised to issue banknotes in India.\n\nThe bank also destroys banknotes when they are not fit for circulation. All the money issued by the central bank is its monetary liability, i.e., the central bank is obliged to back the currency with assets of equal value,  to enhance public confidence in paper currency. The objectives are to issue banknotes and give the public adequate supply of the same, to maintain the currency and credit system of the country to utilise it in its best advantage, and to maintain the reserves.\n\nThe RBI maintains the economic structure of the country so that it can achieve the objective of price stability as well as economic development because both objectives are diverse in themselves.\n\nFor the printing of notes, RBI uses four facilities:<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/Content/PDFs/FUNCWWE080910.pdf|title=RBI, Right To Information Doc, Pg 29/30}}</ref>\n* The [[Security Printing and Minting Corporation of India Limited]] (SPMCIL), a wholly owned company of the Government of India, has printing presses at [[Nashik]], Maharashtra and [[Dewas]], Madhya Pradesh.\n* The [[Bharatiya Reserve Bank Note Mudran Private Limited]] (BRBNMPL), owned by the RBI, has printing facilities in [[Mysore]], Karnataka and [[Salboni]], West Bengal.\n\nFor the minting of coins, SPMCIL has four mints at [[Mumbai]], [[Noida]], [[Kolkata]] and [[Hyderabad]] for coin production.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nWhilst coins are minted by, and [[Indian 1-rupee note|{{INR}}1 notes]] are issued by the Government of India (GoI), the RBI works as an agent of GoI for the distribution and handling of coins. RBI also works to prevent counterfeiting of currency by regularly upgrading security features of currency.\n\nThe RBI is authorised to issue notes with face values of up to {{INR}}10,000 and coins up to {{INR}}1,000 rupees.\n\nNew [[Indian 500-rupee note|{{INR}}500]] and [[Indian 2000-rupee note|{{INR}}2,000]] notes were been issued on 8 November 2016. The old series of [[Indian 1000-rupee note|{{INR}}1,000]] and {{INR}}500 notes were demonetized from midnight on 8 November 2016.\n\nEarlier {{INR}}1,000 notes have been discarded by the RBI.\n\n===Banker's bank===\n[[File:Nagpur Reserve Bank.JPG|thumb|[[Nagpur]] branch holds most of India's gold deposits.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rbi.org.in/regionalbranch/nagpur/profile.aspx | title=Reserve Bank of India \u2013 Nagpur \u2013 Profile}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rbi.org.in/regionalbranch/nagpur/nagpur.aspx | title=Reserve Bank of India \u2013 Nagpur}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/AnnualReportPublications.aspx?Id=1239 | title=Reserve Bank of India \u2013 Annual Report}}</ref><ref name=\"nagpurtoday1\">{{cite web | url=https://www.nagpurtoday.in/old-gold-lying-in-nagpur-may-boost-forex-as-rbi-plans-to-swap-the-metal-with-purer-stuff/07022015 | title=Old gold lying in Nagpur may boost forex as RBI plans to swap the metal with purer stuff}}</ref>]]\n\nReserve Bank of India also works as a central bank where commercial banks are account holders and can deposit money. RBI maintains banking accounts of all scheduled banks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rbi.org.in/|title=Reserve Bank of India \u2013 India's Central Bank|work=rbi.org.in}}</ref> Commercial banks create credit. It is the duty of the RBI to control the credit through the CRR, repo rate and open market operations. As banker's bank, the RBI facilitates the clearing of cheques between the commercial banks and helps the inter-bank transfer of funds. It can grant financial accommodation to schedule banks. It acts as the lender of the last resort by providing emergency advances to the banks.\n\n===Regulator of the Banking System===\nRBI has the responsibility of regulating the nation's financial system. As a regulator and supervisor of the Indian banking system it ensures financial stability & public confidence in the banking system. RBI uses methods like On-site inspections, off-site surveillance, scrutiny & periodic meetings to supervise new bank licences, setting capital requirements and regulating interest rates in specific areas. RBI is currently focused on implementing norms.\n\n===Detection of fake currency===\nTo curb the [[counterfeit money]] problem in India, RBI has launched a website to raise awareness among masses about fake banknotes in the market. [https://paisaboltahai.rbi.org.in/ www.paisaboltahai.rbi.org.in] provides information about identifying fake currency.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/RBI-launches-website-to-explain-detection-of-fake-currency/articleshow/14742791.cms | title=RBI launches website to explain detection of fake currency | date=8 July 2012 | work=Times of India}}</ref>\n\nOn 22 January 2014; RBI gave a press release stating that after 31 March 2014, it will completely withdraw from circulation of all banknotes issued prior to 2005. From 1 April 2014, the public will be required to approach banks for exchanging these notes. Banks will provide exchange facility for these notes until further communication. The reserve bank has also clarified that the notes issued before 2005 will continue to be legal tender. This would mean that banks are required to exchange the notes for their customers as well as for non-customers. From 1 July 2014, however, to exchange more than 15 pieces of `500 and `1000 notes, non-customers will have to furnish proof of identity and residence as well as show ''aadhar'' to the bank branch in which he/she wants to exchange the notes.\n\nThis move from the reserve bank is expected to unearth black money held in cash. As the new currency notes have added increased security features, they would help in curbing the menace of fake currency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rbi.org.in/scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=30458|title=Reserve Bank of India|work=rbi.org.in}}</ref>\n\n===Developmental role===\nThe central bank has to perform a wide range of promotional functions to support national objectives and industries.<ref name=\"autogenerated2004\"/> The RBI faces a lot of inter-sectoral and local inflation-related problems.

When the repo rate increases, borrowing from RBI becomes more expensive. If RBI wants to make it more expensive for the banks to borrow money, it increases the repo rate similarly, if it wants to make it cheaper for banks to borrow money it reduces the repo rate. If the repo rate is increased, banks can't carry out their business at a profit whereas the very opposite happens when the repo rate is cut down. Generally, repo rates are cut down whenever the country needs to progress in banking and economy.\n\nIf banks want to borrow money (for short term, usually overnight) from RBI then banks have to charge this interest rate. Banks have to pledge government securities as collateral. This kind of deal happens through a re-purchase agreement. If a bank wants to borrow, it has to provide government securities at least worth {{INR}}100&nbsp;crore (could be more because of margin requirement which is 5%\u201310% of loan amount) and agree to repurchase them at {{INRConvert|106.5|c}} at the end of borrowing period. So the bank has paid {{INRConvert|6.5|c}} as interest. This is the reason it is called repo rate.\n\nThe government securities which are provided by banks as collateral can not come from {{abbr|SLR|statutory liquidity ratio}} quota (otherwise the SLR will go below 19.5% of {{abbr|NDTL|net demand and time liabilities}} and attract penalties).\n\nTo curb inflation, the RBI increases repo rate which will make borrowing costs for banks. Banks will pass this increased cost to their customers which make borrowing costly in the whole economy. Fewer people will apply for loans and aggregate demand will be reduced. This will result in inflation coming down. The RBI does the opposite to fight deflation. When the RBI reduces the repo rate, banks are not legally required to reduce their own [[base rate]].\n\nThe present repo rate is 4.40%.<ref>{{cite web |title=RBI Repo Rate - RBI repo rate news, RBI rate cut announcement, repo rate slashed news |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/rbi-repo-rate |website=The Economic Times |accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Reverse repo rate (RRR)===\n{{see|Repurchase agreement#Reverse repo}}\nAs the name suggest, [[reverse repo]] rate is just the opposite of repo rate. Reverse repo rate is the short term borrowing rate at which RBI borrows money from banks. The reserve bank uses this tool when it feels there is too much money floating in the banking system. An increase in the reverse repo rate means that the banks will get a higher rate of interest from RBI. As a result, banks prefer to lend their money to RBI which is always safe instead of lending it to others (people, companies, etc.) which is always risky.\n\nRepo rate signifies the rate at which liquidity is injected into the banking system by RBI, whereas reverse repo rate signifies the rate at which the central bank absorbs liquidity from the banks. Currently, reverse repo rate is pegged to be 0.25% (or 25 bit/s) below the repo rate.\n\n===Statutory liquidity ratio (SLR)===\n{{see|Reserve requirement}}\nApart from the {{abbr|CRR|cash reserve ratio}}, banks are required to maintain liquid assets in the form of gold, cash and approved securities. Higher liquidity ratio forces commercial banks to maintain a larger proportion of their resources in liquid form and thus reduces their capacity to grant loans and advances, thus it is an anti-inflationary impact. A higher liquidity ratio diverts the bank funds from loans and advances to investment in government and approved securities.\n\nIn well-developed economies, central banks use [[open market operation]]s\u2014buying and selling of eligible securities by the central bank in the money market\u2014to influence the volume of cash reserves with commercial banks and thus influence the volume of loans and advances they can make to the commercial and industrial sectors. In the open money market, government securities are traded at market-related rates of interest. The RBI is resorting increasing to open market operations in recent years. Generally, the RBI uses\n#Minimum margins for lending against specific securities.\n#A ceiling on the amounts of credit for certain purposes.\n#The discriminatory rate of interest charged on certain types of advances.\n\nDirect credit controls in India are of three types:\n#Part of the interest rate structure, i.e., on small savings and provident funds, are administratively set.\n#Banks are mandatory required to keep 19.50% of their NDTL (net demand and time liabilities) in the form of liquid assets.\n#Banks are required to lend to the priority sectors to the extent of 40% of their advances.\n\nThe share of net demand and time liabilities that banks must maintain in safe and liquid assets, such as government securities, cash, and gold. Here it would be pertinent to mention the gold swap of July 2014.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/RBI-initiates-swap-of-old-gold-with-new-one/articleshow/37907102.cms | title=RBI initiates swap of old gold with new one \u2013 Times of India}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.businesstoday.in/current/policy/reserve-bank-of-india-initiates-swap-of-old-gold-with-new/story/207890.html | title=Reserve Bank of India initiates swap of old gold with new one}}</ref><ref>name=\"nagpurtoday1\"</ref> The present SLR is 18.75%.\n\n===Bank rate===\n{{see|Bank rate}}\nBank rate is defined in Section 49 of the RBI Act of 1934 as the \u2018standard rate at which RBI is prepared to buy or rediscount bills of exchange or other commercial papers eligible for purchase'. When banks want to borrow long term funds from the RBI, it is the interest rate which the RBI charges to them. It is currently set to 5.40%.<ref name=\"moneycontrol.com\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/rbi-cuts-repo-rate-by-25-bps/article29593190.ece/amp/|title= rbi-cuts-repo-rate-by-25-bps|newspaper=thehindu|access-date=4 October 2019}}</ref> The bank rate is not used to control money supply, but penal rates continue to be linked to the bank rate. If a bank fails to meet {{abbr|SLR|statutory liquidity ratio}} or {{abbr|CRR|cash reserve ratio}} requirements then the RBI will impose a penalty of 300 [[basis point]]s above bank rate.\n\n===Liquidity adjustment facility (LAF)===\n{{see|Liquidity adjustment facility}}\n[[Liquidity adjustment facility]] was introduced in 2000. LAF is a facility provided by the Reserve Bank of India to scheduled commercial banks to avail of liquidity in case of need or to park excess funds with the RBI on an overnight basis against the collateral of government securities.\n\nRBI accepts applications for a minimum amount of {{INRConvert|5|c|lk=c}} and in multiples of {{INR}}5&nbsp;crore thereafter.\n\n===Cash reserve ratio (CRR)===\nCRR refers to the ratio of bank's cash reserve balances with RBI with reference to the bank's net demand and time liabilities to ensure the liquidity and solvency of the scheduled banks. The share of net demand and time liabilities that banks must maintain as cash with the RBI. The RBI has set CRR at 4%. A 1% change in CRR affects the economy by {{INRConvert|1000000|c|lk=c}}. An increase draw this amount from the economy, while a decrease injects this amount into the economy. So if a bank has {{INRConvert|200|c}} of {{abbr|NDTL|net demand and time liabilities}} then it has to keep {{INRConvert|8|c}} in cash with RBI. RBI pays no interest on CRR.\n\nLet's assume the economy is showing inflationary trends and the RBI wants to control this situation by adjusting {{abbr|SLR|statutory liquidity ratio}} and CRR. If the RBI increases SLR to 50% and CRR to 20% then bank will be left only with {{INRConvert|60|c}} for operations. Now it will be very difficult for the bank to maintain profitability with such a small amount of capital. The bank will be left with no choice but to raise its interest rate which will make borrowing by its customers more costly. This will in turn reduce the overall demand and hence prices will eventually come down.\n\n===Open market operation (OMO)===\n{{see|Open market operation}}\nOpen market operation is the activity of buying and selling of government securities in open market to control the supply of money in banking system. When there is excess supply of money, central bank sells government securities thereby sucking out excess liquidity. Similarly, when liquidity is tight, RBI will buy government securities and thereby inject money supply into the economy.\n\nOn 23 March 2020, Reserve Bank of India infuse Rs 1 lakh crore through term repo auction, a massive [[Open market operation|OMOs (open market operations)]] purchase of government securities. The Reserve Bank is monitoring the financial market conditions and liquidity situation in the economy as [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in India]] fears of a recession.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/coronovirus-scare-rbi-announces-omos-purchase-of-rs-1-lakh-crore-to-boost-liquidity/story/398973.html|title=Coronavirus scare: RBI announces OMOs purchase of Rs 1 lakh crore to boost liquidity|date=23 March 2020|website=Business Today|access-date=23 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Marginal standing facility (MSF)===\nThis scheme was introduced in May 2011 and all the scheduled commercial bank can participate in this scheme. Banks can borrow up to 2.5%<ref>[https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=8248&Mode=0 Reserve Bank of India \u2013 Notifications]. Rbi.org.in. Retrieved on 26 December 2018.</ref> percent of their respective net demand and time liabilities. The RBI receives application under this facility for a minimum amount of Rs.&nbsp;1 crore and in multiples of Rs.&nbsp;1 crore thereafter.\n\nThe important difference from repo rate is that bank can pledge government securities from its SLR quota (up to one percent). So even if SLR goes below 20.5%<ref>RBI/2014-15/445 DBR.Ret.BC.70/12.02.001/2014-15, dt. 16 October 2016</ref> by pledging SLR quota securities under MSF, the bank will not have to pay any penalty. The MSF rate is set to 100 [[basis point]]s above bank rate and currently is at 5.65% as of 7 August 2019.<ref name=\"moneycontrol.com\"/>\n\n==Qualitative tools==\n===Margin requirements===\n{{see|Loan-to-value ratio}}\nLoan-to-value (LTV) is the ratio of loan amount to the actual value of asset purchased.\n\nThe RBI regulates this ratio so as to control the amount a bank can lend to its customers. For example, an individual wants to buy a car using borrowed money and the car's value is {{INRConvert|10|l|lk=l}}. If the LTV is set to 70% he can borrow a maximum of {{INRConvert|7|l}}.\n\nThe RBI can decrease or increase to curb inflation or deflation respectively.\n\n===Selective credit control===\nUnder this measure, the RBI can specifically instruct banks not to give loans to traders of certain commodities e.g. sugar, edible oil, etc.\n\nThis prevents the speculation/hoarding of commodities using money borrowed from banks.\n\n===Moral suasion===\n{{see|Moral suasion}}\nUnder this measure, the RBI try to persuade banks through meetings, conferences, media statements to do specific things under certain economic trends. For example, when the RBI reduces repo rate, it asks banks to reduce their base rate as well. Another example of this measure is to ask banks to reduce their [[non-performing loan|non-performing asset]]s.\n\n==Limitations of monetary policy==\nIn developing countries like India, monetary policy fails to show immediate or no results because the following factors:\n\n# People do not employ alternative investment options. A large section of society still depends on saving accounts, fixed deposits, Public Provident Fund for investment. Commercial banks have large deposits. RBI is not the main or even prominent money supplier for these banks. So whatever monetary action central bank takes has little or late impact on the economy.\n# Many people in rural areas are out of the banking net and whatever the RBI does, has no impact on their financial activities.\n# Monsoon uncertainty adversely affects food production and thereby cause food inflation. Monetary policy has no impact on food inflation.\n\n==RTGS and NEFT transactions' charges removal==\n\nRBI decided to remove charges on RTGS (Real Time Gross Settlement System) and NEFT ([[National Electronic Funds Transfer]]).<ref>{{cite news | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/69673075.cms |newspaper=Times of India | title=RBI removes charges on NEFT, RTGS transactions | date=6 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Regulation of variable pay of bank management ==\nIn November, RBI introduced a set of draft guidelines to regulate the variable pay of CEOs and top management at private banks. The new rules are in line with the Sound Compensation Practices issued by the Financial Stability Board in April 2009. The rules will apply to CEOs, wholetime directors, and material risk takers at private banks, small finance banks and domestic executives of foreign banks. As per the new rules at least 50% of the pay should be based on individual, unit, business and firm wide performance evaluation which will be capped at 300% of the fixed pay. In case of variable pay above 200% then at least 50% of this amount should be via non cash instruments. Share linked instruments are included as part of variable pay. Guaranteed bonus should not be part of the compensation package except in case of joining bonus. The RBI also has put clauses in place to clawback/malus in case of deteriorating performance. The bank shall identify a representative set of conditions when the recovery clause for clawback /malus can be invoked.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/rbi-clamps-down-on-variable-pay-of-top-management-at-private-banks|title=RBI Clamps Down On Variable Pay Of Top Management At Private Banks|website=BloombergQuint|language=en|access-date=5 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Publications==\nA report titled \"Trend and Progress of Banking In India\" is published annually, as required by the ''[[Banking Regulation Act, 1949]]''.

It also works for overall economic growth of the country. The preamble of the Reserve Bank of India describes its main functions as:<blockquote>'''''..to regulate the issue of Bank Notes and keeping of reserves with a view to securing monetary stability in India and generally to operate the currency and credit system of the country to its advantage.'''''</blockquote>\n\n===Financial supervision===\nThe primary objective of RBI is to undertake consolidated supervision of the financial sector comprising commercial banks, financial institutions, and non-banking finance companies.\n\nThe board is constituted by co-opting four directors from the Central Board as members for a term of two years and is chaired by the governor. The deputy governors of the reserve bank are ex-officio members. One deputy governor, usually the deputy governor in charge of banking regulation and supervision, is nominated as the vice-chairman of the board. The board is required to meet normally once every month. It considers inspection reports and other supervisory issues placed before it by the supervisory departments.\n\nBFS through the Audit Sub-Committee also aims at upgrading the quality of the statutory audit and internal audit functions in banks and financial institutions. The audit sub-committee includes deputy governor as the chairman and two directors of the Central Board as members. The BFS oversees the functioning of the Department of Banking Supervision (DBS), the Department of Non-Banking Supervision (DNBS) and the Financial Institutions Division (FID) and gives directions on the regulatory and supervisory issues.\n\n===Regulator and supervisor of the financial system===\nThe institution is also the regulator and supervisor of the financial system and prescribes broad parameters of banking operations within which the country's banking and financial system functions. Its objectives are to maintain public confidence in the system, protect depositors' interest and provide cost-effective banking services to the public. The ''Banking Ombudsman Scheme'' has been formulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for effective addressing of complaints by bank customers. The RBI controls the monetary supply, monitors economic indicators like the [[gross domestic product]] and has to decide the design of the rupee banknotes as well as coins.<ref name=\"RBI1\">[http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FAQView.aspx?Id=39 RBI, Frequently Asked Questions, Currency Matters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112123135/http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FAQView.aspx?Id=39 |date=12 January 2012 }} (RBI)</ref>\n\n===Regulator and supervisor of the payment and settlement systems===\nPayment and settlement systems play an important role in improving overall economic efficiency. The Payment and Settlement Systems Act of 2007 (PSS Act)<ref>[http://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/Publications/PDFs/86706.pdf The Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007]. rbi.org.in</ref> gives the Reserve Bank oversight authority, including regulation and supervision, for the payment and settlement systems in the country. In this role, the RBI focuses on the development and functioning of safe, secure and efficient payment and settlement mechanisms. Two payment systems [[National Electronic Fund Transfer]] (NEFT) and Real-Time Gross Settlement ([[real-time gross settlement|RTGS]]) allow individuals, companies and firms to transfer funds from one bank to another. These facilities can only be used for transferring money within the country.\n\nNEFT operates on a deferred net settlement (DNS) basis and settles transactions in batches. The settlement takes place for all transactions received until a particular cut-off time. It operates in hourly batches \u2014 there are twelve settlements from 8&nbsp;am to 7&nbsp;pm on weekdays and six between 8&nbsp;am and 1&nbsp;pm on Saturdays.<ref>[http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FAQView.aspx?Id=60 Frequently Asked Questions]. rbi.org.in (24 November 2017)</ref> Any transaction initiated after the designated time would have to wait until the next settlement time. In RTGS, transactions are processed continuously, all through the business hours. RBI's settlement time is 9&nbsp;am to 4:30&nbsp;pm on weekdays and 9&nbsp;am to 2&nbsp;pm on Saturdays.<ref>[http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FAQView.aspx?Id=65 Frequently Asked Questions]. rbi.org.in (10 December 2018)</ref>\n\n===Banker and debt manager to government===\nJust as individuals need a bank to carry out their financial transactions effectively and efficiently, governments also need a bank to carry out their financial transactions. The RBI serves this purpose for the Government of India (GoI). As a banker to the GoI, the RBI maintains its accounts, receive payments into and make payments out of these accounts. The RBI also helps the GoI to raise money from the public via issuing bonds and government-approved securities. In Sep 2019, a decision at RBI directors meet was taken to change the RBI financial accounting year to March\u2013April to align itself with the central government calendar instead of the current June\u2013July year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/finance/after-nearly-8-decades-rbi-to-change-its-accounting-year-to-april-march-119082700038_1.html|title=After nearly 8 decades, RBI to change its accounting year to April\u2013March|last=Jha|first=Somesh|date=27 August 2019|work=Business Standard India|access-date=3 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Managing foreign exchange===\nThe central bank manages to reach different goals of the ''[[Foreign Exchange Management Act|Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999]]''. Their objective is to facilitate external trade and payment and promote orderly development and maintenance of foreign exchange market in India.\n\nWith the increasing integration of the Indian economy with the global economy arising from greater trade and capital flows, the [[foreign exchange market]] has evolved as a key segment of the Indian financial market and the RBI has an important role to play in regulating and managing this segment. The RBI manages forex and gold reserves of the nation.\n\nOn a given day, the foreign exchange rate reflects the demand for and supply of foreign exchange arising from trade and capital transactions. The RBI's Financial Markets Department (FMD) participates in the foreign exchange market by undertaking sales/purchases of foreign currency to ease volatility in periods of excess demand for/supply of foreign currency.\n\n===Issue of currency===\nOther than the Government of India, the Reserve Bank of India is the sole body authorised to issue banknotes in India.\n\nThe bank also destroys banknotes when they are not fit for circulation. All the money issued by the central bank is its monetary liability, i.e., the central bank is obliged to back the currency with assets of equal value,  to enhance public confidence in paper currency. The objectives are to issue banknotes and give the public adequate supply of the same, to maintain the currency and credit system of the country to utilise it in its best advantage, and to maintain the reserves.\n\nThe RBI maintains the economic structure of the country so that it can achieve the objective of price stability as well as economic development because both objectives are diverse in themselves.\n\nFor the printing of notes, RBI uses four facilities:<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/Content/PDFs/FUNCWWE080910.pdf|title=RBI, Right To Information Doc, Pg 29/30}}</ref>\n* The [[Security Printing and Minting Corporation of India Limited]] (SPMCIL), a wholly owned company of the Government of India, has printing presses at [[Nashik]], Maharashtra and [[Dewas]], Madhya Pradesh.\n* The [[Bharatiya Reserve Bank Note Mudran Private Limited]] (BRBNMPL), owned by the RBI, has printing facilities in [[Mysore]], Karnataka and [[Salboni]], West Bengal.\n\nFor the minting of coins, SPMCIL has four mints at [[Mumbai]], [[Noida]], [[Kolkata]] and [[Hyderabad]] for coin production.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nWhilst coins are minted by, and [[Indian 1-rupee note|{{INR}}1 notes]] are issued by the Government of India (GoI), the RBI works as an agent of GoI for the distribution and handling of coins. RBI also works to prevent counterfeiting of currency by regularly upgrading security features of currency.\n\nThe RBI is authorised to issue notes with face values of up to {{INR}}10,000 and coins up to {{INR}}1,000 rupees.\n\nNew [[Indian 500-rupee note|{{INR}}500]] and [[Indian 2000-rupee note|{{INR}}2,000]] notes were been issued on 8 November 2016.

RBI maintains banking accounts of all scheduled banks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rbi.org.in/|title=Reserve Bank of India \u2013 India's Central Bank|work=rbi.org.in}}</ref> Commercial banks create credit. It is the duty of the RBI to control the credit through the CRR, repo rate and open market operations. As banker's bank, the RBI facilitates the clearing of cheques between the commercial banks and helps the inter-bank transfer of funds. It can grant financial accommodation to schedule banks. It acts as the lender of the last resort by providing emergency advances to the banks.\n\n===Regulator of the Banking System===\nRBI has the responsibility of regulating the nation's financial system. As a regulator and supervisor of the Indian banking system it ensures financial stability & public confidence in the banking system. RBI uses methods like On-site inspections, off-site surveillance, scrutiny & periodic meetings to supervise new bank licences, setting capital requirements and regulating interest rates in specific areas. RBI is currently focused on implementing norms.\n\n===Detection of fake currency===\nTo curb the [[counterfeit money]] problem in India, RBI has launched a website to raise awareness among masses about fake banknotes in the market. [https://paisaboltahai.rbi.org.in/ www.paisaboltahai.rbi.org.in] provides information about identifying fake currency.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/RBI-launches-website-to-explain-detection-of-fake-currency/articleshow/14742791.cms | title=RBI launches website to explain detection of fake currency | date=8 July 2012 | work=Times of India}}</ref>\n\nOn 22 January 2014; RBI gave a press release stating that after 31 March 2014, it will completely withdraw from circulation of all banknotes issued prior to 2005. From 1 April 2014, the public will be required to approach banks for exchanging these notes. Banks will provide exchange facility for these notes until further communication. The reserve bank has also clarified that the notes issued before 2005 will continue to be legal tender. This would mean that banks are required to exchange the notes for their customers as well as for non-customers. From 1 July 2014, however, to exchange more than 15 pieces of `500 and `1000 notes, non-customers will have to furnish proof of identity and residence as well as show ''aadhar'' to the bank branch in which he/she wants to exchange the notes.\n\nThis move from the reserve bank is expected to unearth black money held in cash. As the new currency notes have added increased security features, they would help in curbing the menace of fake currency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rbi.org.in/scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=30458|title=Reserve Bank of India|work=rbi.org.in}}</ref>\n\n===Developmental role===\nThe central bank has to perform a wide range of promotional functions to support national objectives and industries.<ref name=\"autogenerated2004\"/> The RBI faces a lot of inter-sectoral and local inflation-related problems.

When the repo rate increases, borrowing from RBI becomes more expensive. If RBI wants to make it more expensive for the banks to borrow money, it increases the repo rate similarly, if it wants to make it cheaper for banks to borrow money it reduces the repo rate. If the repo rate is increased, banks can't carry out their business at a profit whereas the very opposite happens when the repo rate is cut down. Generally, repo rates are cut down whenever the country needs to progress in banking and economy.\n\nIf banks want to borrow money (for short term, usually overnight) from RBI then banks have to charge this interest rate. Banks have to pledge government securities as collateral. This kind of deal happens through a re-purchase agreement. If a bank wants to borrow, it has to provide government securities at least worth {{INR}}100&nbsp;crore (could be more because of margin requirement which is 5%\u201310% of loan amount) and agree to repurchase them at {{INRConvert|106.5|c}} at the end of borrowing period. So the bank has paid {{INRConvert|6.5|c}} as interest. This is the reason it is called repo rate.\n\nThe government securities which are provided by banks as collateral can not come from {{abbr|SLR|statutory liquidity ratio}} quota (otherwise the SLR will go below 19.5% of {{abbr|NDTL|net demand and time liabilities}} and attract penalties).\n\nTo curb inflation, the RBI increases repo rate which will make borrowing costs for banks. Banks will pass this increased cost to their customers which make borrowing costly in the whole economy. Fewer people will apply for loans and aggregate demand will be reduced. This will result in inflation coming down. The RBI does the opposite to fight deflation. When the RBI reduces the repo rate, banks are not legally required to reduce their own [[base rate]].\n\nThe present repo rate is 5.15%.<ref>{{cite web |title=RBI Repo Rate - RBI repo rate news, RBI rate cut announcement, repo rate slashed news |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/rbi-repo-rate |website=The Economic Times |accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Reverse repo rate (RRR)===\n{{see|Repurchase agreement#Reverse repo}}\nAs the name suggest, [[reverse repo]] rate is just the opposite of repo rate. Reverse repo rate is the short term borrowing rate at which RBI borrows money from banks. The reserve bank uses this tool when it feels there is too much money floating in the banking system. An increase in the reverse repo rate means that the banks will get a higher rate of interest from RBI. As a result, banks prefer to lend their money to RBI which is always safe instead of lending it to others (people, companies, etc.) which is always risky.\n\nRepo rate signifies the rate at which liquidity is injected into the banking system by RBI, whereas reverse repo rate signifies the rate at which the central bank absorbs liquidity from the banks. Currently, reverse repo rate is pegged to be 0.25% (or 25 bit/s) below the repo rate.\n\n===Statutory liquidity ratio (SLR)===\n{{see|Reserve requirement}}\nApart from the {{abbr|CRR|cash reserve ratio}}, banks are required to maintain liquid assets in the form of gold, cash and approved securities. Higher liquidity ratio forces commercial banks to maintain a larger proportion of their resources in liquid form and thus reduces their capacity to grant loans and advances, thus it is an anti-inflationary impact. A higher liquidity ratio diverts the bank funds from loans and advances to investment in government and approved securities.\n\nIn well-developed economies, central banks use [[open market operation]]s\u2014buying and selling of eligible securities by the central bank in the money market\u2014to influence the volume of cash reserves with commercial banks and thus influence the volume of loans and advances they can make to the commercial and industrial sectors. In the open money market, government securities are traded at market-related rates of interest. The RBI is resorting increasing to open market operations in recent years. Generally, the RBI uses\n#Minimum margins for lending against specific securities.\n#A ceiling on the amounts of credit for certain purposes.\n#The discriminatory rate of interest charged on certain types of advances.\n\nDirect credit controls in India are of three types:\n#Part of the interest rate structure, i.e., on small savings and provident funds, are administratively set.\n#Banks are mandatory required to keep 19.50% of their NDTL (net demand and time liabilities) in the form of liquid assets.\n#Banks are required to lend to the priority sectors to the extent of 40% of their advances.\n\nThe share of net demand and time liabilities that banks must maintain in safe and liquid assets, such as government securities, cash, and gold. Here it would be pertinent to mention the gold swap of July 2014.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/RBI-initiates-swap-of-old-gold-with-new-one/articleshow/37907102.cms | title=RBI initiates swap of old gold with new one \u2013 Times of India}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.businesstoday.in/current/policy/reserve-bank-of-india-initiates-swap-of-old-gold-with-new/story/207890.html | title=Reserve Bank of India initiates swap of old gold with new one}}</ref><ref>name=\"nagpurtoday1\"</ref> The present SLR is 18.75%.\n\n===Bank rate===\n{{see|Bank rate}}\nBank rate is defined in Section 49 of the RBI Act of 1934 as the \u2018standard rate at which RBI is prepared to buy or rediscount bills of exchange or other commercial papers eligible for purchase'. When banks want to borrow long term funds from the RBI, it is the interest rate which the RBI charges to them. It is currently set to 5.40%.<ref name=\"moneycontrol.com\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/rbi-cuts-repo-rate-by-25-bps/article29593190.ece/amp/|title= rbi-cuts-repo-rate-by-25-bps|newspaper=thehindu|access-date=4 October 2019}}</ref> The bank rate is not used to control money supply, but penal rates continue to be linked to the bank rate. If a bank fails to meet {{abbr|SLR|statutory liquidity ratio}} or {{abbr|CRR|cash reserve ratio}} requirements then the RBI will impose a penalty of 300 [[basis point]]s above bank rate.\n\n===Liquidity adjustment facility (LAF)===\n{{see|Liquidity adjustment facility}}\n[[Liquidity adjustment facility]] was introduced in 2000. LAF is a facility provided by the Reserve Bank of India to scheduled commercial banks to avail of liquidity in case of need or to park excess funds with the RBI on an overnight basis against the collateral of government securities.\n\nRBI accepts applications for a minimum amount of {{INRConvert|5|c|lk=c}} and in multiples of {{INR}}5&nbsp;crore thereafter.\n\n===Cash reserve ratio (CRR)===\nCRR refers to the ratio of bank's cash reserve balances with RBI with reference to the bank's net demand and time liabilities to ensure the liquidity and solvency of the scheduled banks. The share of net demand and time liabilities that banks must maintain as cash with the RBI. The RBI has set CRR at 4%. A 1% change in CRR affects the economy by {{INRConvert|1000000|c|lk=c}}. An increase draw this amount from the economy, while a decrease injects this amount into the economy. So if a bank has {{INRConvert|200|c}} of {{abbr|NDTL|net demand and time liabilities}} then it has to keep {{INRConvert|8|c}} in cash with RBI. RBI pays no interest on CRR.\n\nLet's assume the economy is showing inflationary trends and the RBI wants to control this situation by adjusting {{abbr|SLR|statutory liquidity ratio}} and CRR. If the RBI increases SLR to 50% and CRR to 20% then bank will be left only with {{INRConvert|60|c}} for operations. Now it will be very difficult for the bank to maintain profitability with such a small amount of capital. The bank will be left with no choice but to raise its interest rate which will make borrowing by its customers more costly. This will in turn reduce the overall demand and hence prices will eventually come down.\n\n===Open market operation (OMO)===\n{{see|Open market operation}}\nOpen market operation is the activity of buying and selling of government securities in open market to control the supply of money in banking system. When there is excess supply of money, central bank sells government securities thereby sucking out excess liquidity. Similarly, when liquidity is tight, RBI will buy government securities and thereby inject money supply into the economy.\n\nOn 23 March 2020, Reserve Bank of India infuse Rs 1 lakh crore through term repo auction, a massive [[Open market operation|OMOs (open market operations)]] purchase of government securities. The Reserve Bank is monitoring the financial market conditions and liquidity situation in the economy as [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in India]] fears of a recession.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/coronovirus-scare-rbi-announces-omos-purchase-of-rs-1-lakh-crore-to-boost-liquidity/story/398973.html|title=Coronavirus scare: RBI announces OMOs purchase of Rs 1 lakh crore to boost liquidity|date=23 March 2020|website=Business Today|access-date=23 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Marginal standing facility (MSF)===\nThis scheme was introduced in May 2011 and all the scheduled commercial bank can participate in this scheme. Banks can borrow up to 2.5%<ref>[https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=8248&Mode=0 Reserve Bank of India \u2013 Notifications]. Rbi.org.in. Retrieved on 26 December 2018.</ref> percent of their respective net demand and time liabilities. The RBI receives application under this facility for a minimum amount of Rs.&nbsp;1 crore and in multiples of Rs.&nbsp;1 crore thereafter.\n\nThe important difference from repo rate is that bank can pledge government securities from its SLR quota (up to one percent). So even if SLR goes below 20.5%<ref>RBI/2014-15/445 DBR.Ret.BC.70/12.02.001/2014-15, dt. 16 October 2016</ref> by pledging SLR quota securities under MSF, the bank will not have to pay any penalty. The MSF rate is set to 100 [[basis point]]s above bank rate and currently is at 5.65% as of 7 August 2019.<ref name=\"moneycontrol.com\"/>\n\n==Qualitative tools==\n===Margin requirements===\n{{see|Loan-to-value ratio}}\nLoan-to-value (LTV) is the ratio of loan amount to the actual value of asset purchased.\n\nThe RBI regulates this ratio so as to control the amount a bank can lend to its customers. For example, an individual wants to buy a car using borrowed money and the car's value is {{INRConvert|10|l|lk=l}}. If the LTV is set to 70% he can borrow a maximum of {{INRConvert|7|l}}.\n\nThe RBI can decrease or increase to curb inflation or deflation respectively.\n\n===Selective credit control===\nUnder this measure, the RBI can specifically instruct banks not to give loans to traders of certain commodities e.g. sugar, edible oil, etc.\n\nThis prevents the speculation/hoarding of commodities using money borrowed from banks.\n\n===Moral suasion===\n{{see|Moral suasion}}\nUnder this measure, the RBI try to persuade banks through meetings, conferences, media statements to do specific things under certain economic trends. For example, when the RBI reduces repo rate, it asks banks to reduce their base rate as well. Another example of this measure is to ask banks to reduce their [[non-performing loan|non-performing asset]]s.\n\n==Limitations of monetary policy==\nIn developing countries like India, monetary policy fails to show immediate or no results because the following factors:\n\n# People do not employ alternative investment options. A large section of society still depends on saving accounts, fixed deposits, Public Provident Fund for investment. Commercial banks have large deposits. RBI is not the main or even prominent money supplier for these banks. So whatever monetary action central bank takes has little or late impact on the economy.\n# Many people in rural areas are out of the banking net and whatever the RBI does, has no impact on their financial activities.\n# Monsoon uncertainty adversely affects food production and thereby cause food inflation. Monetary policy has no impact on food inflation.\n\n==RTGS and NEFT transactions' charges removal==\n\nRBI decided to remove charges on RTGS (Real Time Gross Settlement System) and NEFT ([[National Electronic Funds Transfer]]).<ref>{{cite news | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/69673075.cms |newspaper=Times of India | title=RBI removes charges on NEFT, RTGS transactions | date=6 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Regulation of variable pay of bank management ==\nIn November, RBI introduced a set of draft guidelines to regulate the variable pay of CEOs and top management at private banks. The new rules are in line with the Sound Compensation Practices issued by the Financial Stability Board in April 2009. The rules will apply to CEOs, wholetime directors, and material risk takers at private banks, small finance banks and domestic executives of foreign banks. As per the new rules at least 50% of the pay should be based on individual, unit, business and firm wide performance evaluation which will be capped at 300% of the fixed pay. In case of variable pay above 200% then at least 50% of this amount should be via non cash instruments. Share linked instruments are included as part of variable pay. Guaranteed bonus should not be part of the compensation package except in case of joining bonus. The RBI also has put clauses in place to clawback/malus in case of deteriorating performance. The bank shall identify a representative set of conditions when the recovery clause for clawback /malus can be invoked.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/rbi-clamps-down-on-variable-pay-of-top-management-at-private-banks|title=RBI Clamps Down On Variable Pay Of Top Management At Private Banks|website=BloombergQuint|language=en|access-date=5 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Publications==\nA report titled \"Trend and Progress of Banking In India\" is published annually, as required by the ''[[Banking Regulation Act, 1949]]''.
