With the {{convert|175|lb|kg|abbr=on}} Royce Gracie winning three of the first four events, the UFC quickly proved that size does not always determine the outcome of the fight.\n\nDuring this early part of the organization, the UFC would showcase a bevy of different styles and fighters. Aside from the aforementioned [[Royce Gracie]], [[Ken Shamrock]], and [[Patrick Smith (fighter)|Patrick Smith]], the competitions also featured competitors such as [[List of halls and walks of fame|Hall of Fame]]r [[Dan Severn]], [[Marco Ruas]], [[Gary Goodridge]], [[Don Frye]], [[Kimo Leopoldo]], [[Oleg Taktarov]], and [[Tank Abbott]]. Although the first events were dominated by jiu-jitsu, other fighting styles became successful: first wrestling, then [[ground and pound]], kickboxing, boxing, and [[Clinch fighting|dirty boxing]], which eventually melded into modern [[mixed martial arts]].\n\nIn April 1995, following ''[[UFC 5]]'' in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], Davie and Gracie sold their interest in the franchise to SEG and disbanded WOW Promotions. Davie continued with SEG as the show's booker and matchmaker, as well as the commissioner of Ultimate Fighting, until December 1997.\n\n====Emergence of stricter rules====\nAlthough UFC used the tagline \"There are no rules\" in the early 1990s, the UFC did in fact operate with limited rules. It banned biting and eye-gouging, and allowed techniques such as hair pulling, [[headbutt]]ing, [[groin attack|groin strikes]], and [[fish-hooking]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn a ''[[UFC 4]]'' qualifying match, competitors Jason Fairn and [[Guy Mezger]] agreed not to pull hair\u2014as they both wore pony tails tied back for the match. That same event saw a matchup between [[Keith Hackney]] and [[Joe Son]] in which Hackney unleashed a series of groin shots against Son while on the ground.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe UFC had a reputation, especially in the early days, as an extremely violent event, as evidenced by a disclaimer in the beginning of the ''[[UFC 5]]'' broadcast which warned audiences of the violent nature of the sport.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n''UFC 5'' also introduced the first singles match, a rematch from the inaugural UFC featuring three-time champion Royce Gracie and Ken Shamrock, called \"The Superfight\". This proved an important development, because singles matches would feature fighters who suffered no prior damage from a previous fight in the same event, unlike tournament matches. Singles matches would become a staple in the UFC for years to come.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n\"The Superfight\" began as a non-tournament match that would determine the first reigning UFC Champion for tournament winners to face;<ref>\n{{cite web |last=Meltzer |first=Dave |url= https://sports.yahoo.com/mma/news;_ylt=AnbS9oIfkDYxeule15884RJZEo14?slug=dm-ufcsix040809&prov=yhoo&type=lgns |title=Relive UFC 6: Clash of the Titans |work=Sports.yahoo.com |date=April 8, 2009 |accessdate=April 8, 2009}}</ref> it later evolved into a match that could feature either title matches or non-title matches. The \"Superfight\" would eventually completely phase out tournament matches; by ''[[UFC Brazil]]'', the UFC abandoned the tournament format for an entire card of singles matches (aside from a one-time ''[[UFC 23|UFC Japan]]'' tournament featuring Japanese fighters). ''[[UFC 6]]'' was the first event to feature the crowning of the first non-tournament UFC Champion, [[Ken Shamrock]].\n\n==={{anchor|Controversy and reform}}Controversy and reform: late 1990s===\nThe violent nature of the burgeoning sport quickly drew the attention of the U.S. authorities.<ref>{{cite news|last=Flegenheimer|first=Matt|title=No Resolution for Mixed Martial Arts|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/27/nyregion/obstacles-in-push-to-legalize-mixed-martial-arts-in-new-york.html?_r=1&ref=mixedmartialarts|accessdate=December 31, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 26, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, Senator [[John McCain]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Arizona|AZ]]) saw a tape of the first UFC events and immediately found it abhorrent.

''UFC 12'' saw the introduction of weight classes and the banning of [[fish-hooking]]. For ''[[UFC 14]]'', gloves became mandatory, while kicks to the head of a downed opponent were banned. ''[[UFC 15]]'' saw limitations on hair pulling, and the banning of strikes to the back of the neck and head, headbutting, small-joint manipulations, and groin strikes.

SEG could not secure home-video releases for ''[[UFC 23]]'' through ''[[UFC 29]]''. With other mixed martial arts promotions working towards U.S. sanctioning, the International Fighting Championships (IFC) secured the first U.S. sanctioned mixed-martial-arts event, which occurred in New Jersey on September 30, 2000.

The same rule applies to returning fighters who were terminated or whose contracts were not renewed at the decision of the UFC.  Previously, returning or terminated fighters were required to undergo four months of testings prior to competing in a fight. (2)  Returning fighters who have chosen to retire, go on hiatus, or had a non-renewal of their contract,  are required to be in a six-months testing pool prior to competition.

Retrieved April 3, 2006.</ref> The set of \"[[Mixed martial arts rules#Unified Rules of MMA|Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts]]\" that New Jersey established has been adopted in other states that regulate mixed martial arts, including Nevada, Louisiana, and California. These rules are also used by many other promotions within the United States, becoming mandatory for those states that have adopted the rules, and so have become the standard ''de facto'' set of rules for professional mixed martial arts across the country.\n\n===Rounds===\nUFC matches vary in maximum length, depending on whether the match is for a Championship title, or  is a fight card's \"main event\" fight. In all fights, each round can be no longer than five minutes.  Championship fights last for a maximum of five rounds. Beginning with [[UFC 138]] on November 5, 2011, non-championship \"main event\" fights (i.e. the final fight on the card) will also last for a maximum of five rounds. Non-main event bouts last for a maximum of three rounds. [[UFC on FX: Alves vs. Kampmann]] featured the organization's first two flyweight fights as part of its first flyweight tournament, which consists of bouts that, in the event of a draw, go to a fourth \"sudden victory\" round held to determine the winner, who advances. There is a one-minute rest period between rounds.\n\n==={{anchor|Octagon}} Cage===\n[[File:Chris Weidman knock out Anderson Silva at UFC 162..jpg|thumb|Shot of the Octagon as [[Chris Weidman]] upsets [[Anderson Silva]] at [[UFC 162]].]]\nThe UFC stages bouts in an eight-sided enclosure officially named \"The Octagon\". Originally, SEG trademarked the concept as well as the term and prevented other mixed martial arts promotions from using the same type of cage, but in 2001 Zuffa gave permission for other promotions to use octagonal cages, reasoning that the young sport needed uniformity to continue to win official sanctioning. Today Zuffa reserves exclusive use of the name \"The Octagon\".<ref>Gentry, Clyde, ''No Holds Barred: Ultimate Fighting and the Martial Arts Revolution'', (Milo Books: Preston, 2005), p.208</ref>\n\nThe UFC cage is an octagonal structure with walls of metal chain-link fence coated with black vinyl.

Many fighters still chose to wear tight-fitting shorts or boxing-type trunks, while others wore long pants or singlets. Several wore wrestling shoes. Multi-time tournament Champion [[Royce Gracie]] wore a Brazilian jiu-jitsu [[Keikogi|gi]] in all of his early appearances in UFC (Gracie wore shorts against Matt Hughes at UFC 60), while [[Art Jimmerson]] appeared in UFC 1 wearing one standard boxing glove.  As of [[UFC 133]] there has been a ban on speedo style shorts after [[Dennis Hallman]] wore one in his fight against [[Brian Ebersole]].  UFC president [[Dana White]] was so furious about the fighter's choice of attire that he awarded an honorary \"getting those horrifying shorts off TV as soon as possible\" bonus to Ebersole for finishing the fight in the first round, and in following post-fight interviews made it clear that speedo style shorts will no longer be tolerated.\n\n====Reebok Uniform====\nOn December 2, 2014, the UFC and [[Reebok]] held a press conference to announce an exclusive deal for Reebok to become the worldwide outfitter for the UFC, beginning in July 2015. Financial terms of the six-year partnership were not released, but UFC officials said that though the agreement represents the most valuable non-broadcast contract the company has ever signed, the UFC will not directly profit from the new deal. Instead, company execs said the deal is structured so that the \"vast majority of the revenue\" from the deal \u2013 taking out only the costs associated with administering the new program \u2013 will be paid directly to UFC fighters.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\">{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2014/12/ufc-partners-with-reebok-for-uniform-program-rankings-to-determine-fighter-pay|title=UFC partners with Reebok for uniform program; rankings to determine fighter pay|publisher=mmajunkie.com|author=John Morgan|date=December 2, 2014|accessdate=December 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\nPayment on the new deal was originally expected to be based on the fighter's spot in the official [[UFC rankings]], with the exception of the UFC champions. Fighters ranked No. 1 to 5 would be paid at one level, No. 6 to 10 at a lower level, No. 11 to 15 below that, and unranked fighters at a base rate.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\" /> The payments would remain consistent regardless of where the athletes' bouts air. In addition to the per-fight rate, fighters would also receive royalty payments representing 20 percent of any UFC merchandise sold that bears their likeness. The royalty program would also include retired fighters and continue in perpetuity. The deal itself was reported to be worth 70 million dollars which was what the fighters would be paid over the next six years which is roughly 260 thousand dollars per UFC fight card.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\" /> In April 2015, the UFC announced that they scrapped the rankings idea and that payment will be based on the fighter's number of bouts in the octagon, with different tiers (1-5 fights, 6-10 fights, 11-15 fights, and 16-20 fights). Exceptions are made in the event of title fights, with champions and title challengers receiving greater compensation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2015/04/ufc-fighter-rankings-will-no-longer-determine-reebok-sponsorship-pay|title=UFC: Fighter rankings will no longer determine Reebok sponsorship pay|publisher=mmajunkie.com|author=Steven Marrocco|date=April 20, 2015|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref> The kits were revealed on June 30, 2015. All kits feature the fighter's name on the back of the jersey and fighters have the option to choose between a universal kit or a country kit, related to his nationality. There is also a champion kit, designed to be used only by title holders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2015/06/what-you-need-to-know-about-new-ufc-reebok-fight-kit-uniforms-and-gear|title=What you need to know about new UFC-Reebok 'fight kit' uniforms and gear|publisher=mmajunkie.com|author=Staff|date=June 30, 2015|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe new deal meant that beginning with fight week for [[UFC 189]] in Las Vegas, existing sponsors no longer appear on fighter clothing \u2013 not only on fight night, but also at all pre-fight media appearances \u2013 and in-cage sponsor banners have also eliminated. Fighter camps are outfitted with approved clothing to create a uniform look in athletes' corners. Existing sponsors are still welcome to support UFC fighters. However, third-party logos are no longer allowed on UFC broadcasts, other than title-sponsor slots \u2013 similar to those seen with European soccer clubs \u2013 that the UFC may eventually sell to \"a major, global brand\" down the road.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\" />\n\n===Match outcome===\nMatches may end via:\n*'''[[Submission (combat sport term)|Submission]]''': a fighter clearly taps the mat or his opponent, verbally submits, or clearly communicates being in pain (such as by yelling) to a degree that causes the referee to stop the fight. Also, a technical submission may be called when a fighter either loses consciousness or is on the verge of or suffers serious injury while in a hold.\n*'''[[Knockout]]''': a fighter is put into a state of unconsciousness resulting from any legal strike.\n*'''[[Technical Knockout]]''' (TKO): If the referee decides a fighter cannot continue, the fight is ruled as a technical knockout. Technical knockouts can be classified into three categories:\n**referee stoppage (the referee ends the fight because one fighter is deemed unable to intelligently defend himself)\n**doctor stoppage (a ring side doctor decides that it is unsafe for one fighter to continue the bout, due to excessive bleeding or physical injuries)\n**corner stoppage (a fighter's cornerman signals defeat for his own fighter)\n*'''Judges' Decision''': Depending on scoring, a match may end as:\n**unanimous decision (all three judges score a win for fighter A)\n**majority decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a draw)\n**split decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B)\n**technical decision (a fighter is rendered unable to continue as a result of an unintentional illegal element or move, resulting in a decision based on the finished and unfinished rounds if the number of rounds to be judged is sufficient)\n**unanimous draw (all three judges score a draw)\n**majority draw (two judges score a draw, one judge scoring a win)\n**split draw (one judge scores a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B, and one judge scores a draw)\n**technical draw (the bout ends in a manner similar to that of a technical decision, with the judges' scores resulting in a draw)\n*'''Disqualification''': a fighter intentionally executes an illegal move that is considered by the referee or opponent to be injurious or significant enough to negatively alter the opponent's performance should the fight continue, resulting in the opponent's victory.\n*'''Forfeit''': a fighter fails to compete or intentionally and prematurely ends the bout for a reason besides injury, resulting in the opponent's victory.\n*'''No Contest''': a fighter is rendered unable to continue or compete effectively as a result of an unintentional illegal element or move and there is not a sufficient number of finished rounds to be judged to make a technical decision viable, or both fighters are rendered unable to continue or compete effectively. Also, a fight may be ruled a no contest if the original outcome of the bout is changed due to unsatisfactory or illegal circumstances, such as a premature stoppage or a fighter's testing positive for banned substances.\n\nIn the event of a draw, it is not necessary that the fighters' total ''points'' be equal (see, e.g., ''[[UFC 41]]'' Penn vs. Uno, or ''[[UFC 43]]'' Freeman vs. White). However, in a unanimous or split draw, each fighter does score an equal number of ''win judgments'' from the three judges (0 or 1, respectively). Additionally, if a title fight ends in a draw, the defending champ retains the title.\n\n===Judging criteria===\nThe [[10-point must system|ten-point must system]] is in effect for all UFC fights; three judges score each round and the winner of each receives ten points while the loser receives nine points or fewer (although 10\u201310 rounds are given in the rare event that a judge feels the rounds was too close to warrant giving one fighter 10 and the other 9.)  Scores of 10\u20138 are typically awarded for dominant rounds and anything more dominant is scored less. 10\u20137 rounds are very rare.\n\n===Fouls===\nThe Nevada State Athletic Commission currently lists the following as fouls:<ref>[http://www.leg.state.nv.us/NAC/NAC-467.html NSAC Regulations: Chapter 467 \u2013 Unarmed Combat].

If a foul incapacitates a fighter, then the match may end in a disqualification if the foul was intentional, or a no contest if unintentional. If a foul causes a fighter to be unable to continue later in the bout, it ends with a technical decision win to the injured fighter if the injured fighter is ahead on points, otherwise it is a technical draw.<ref>[http://boxing.nv.gov/docs/MMA%20RULES%20Expained.pdf MMA rules explained.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615195416/http://boxing.nv.gov/docs/MMA%20RULES%20Expained.pdf |date=June 15, 2006 }} Nevada State Athletic Commission. Retrieved June 30, 2006.</ref>\n\n===Match conduct===\n*After a verbal warning the referee can stop the fighters and stand them up if they reach a stalemate on the ground (where neither are in a dominant [[Grappling position|position]] or working towards one). This rule is codified in Nevada as the ''stand-up rule''.\n*If the referee pauses the match, it is resumed with the fighters in their prior positions.\n*Grabbing the cage brings a verbal warning, followed by an attempt by the referee to release the grab by pulling on the grabbing hand. If that attempt fails or if the fighter continues to hold the cage, the referee may charge a foul.\n*Early UFC events disregarded verbal sparring / \"trash-talking\" during matches. Under unified rules, antics are permitted before events to add to excitement and allow fighters to express themselves, but abusive language during combat is prohibited.\n\n===Evolution of the rules===\n*''[[UFC 1]]'' \u2013 Although the advertising said ''There Are No Rules'', there were in fact some rules: no biting, no eye-gouging and no groin attacks. Fights ended only in the event of a knockout, submission or the corner throwing in the towel. Despite this, the first match in ''UFC 1'' was won by referee stoppage, even though it was not officially recognized as such at the time.\n*''[[UFC 2]]'' \u2013 Groin attacks were unbanned. Time limits were dropped ending the need for judges. Modifications to the cage were added (the fence became 5 feet tall but would continually grow in height afterwards and the floor became the canvas that is still used today).\n*''[[UFC 3]]'' \u2013 The referee was officially given the authority to stop a fight in case of a fighter being unable to defend himself. A fighter could not kick if he was wearing shoes. This rule would later be discarded, then changed to 'no kicking with shoes while on the ground' and then reinstated, before finally being discarded.\n*''[[UFC 4]]'' \u2013 After tournament alternate [[Steve Jennum]] won ''UFC 3'' by winning only one bout, alternates (replacements) were required to win a pre-tournament bout to qualify for the role of an alternate.\n*''[[UFC 5]]'' \u2013 The organizers introduced a 30-minute time limit. ''UFC 5'' also saw the first Superfight, a one-off bout between two competitors selected by the organizers with the winner being crowned 'Superfight champion' and having the duty of defending his title at the next UFC.\n*''[[UFC 6]]'' \u2013 The referee was given the authority to restart the fight. If two fighters were entangled in a position where there was a ''lack of action'', the referee could stop the fight and restart the competitors on their feet, in their own corner. In ''UFC 6'' they officially adopted the 5-minute extension to the 30-minute rule which had been used in ''UFC 5''.\n*''[[Ultimate Ultimate 1995]]'' \u2013 This event was the first to introduce the no fish-hooking rule and to reinstate judges. Time limits were changed to 15 minutes in the quarter-finals, 18 minutes in the semi-finals and 27 minutes in the finals.\n*''[[UFC 8]]'' \u2013 Time limits changed to 10 minutes in the first two rounds of the tournament, 15 minutes in the tournament final and Superfight. Time limits would continually change in the later UFC events. Fights could now be decided by a judges decision if the fight reached the end of the time limit. The panel was made up of three judges who simply raised a card with the name of the fighter they considered to be the winner. In this fashion, a draw was not possible since the only two possible outcomes of a decision were 3 to 0 or 2 to 1 in favor of the winner.\n*''[[UFC 9]]'' \u2013 To appease local authorities, closed fisted strikes to the head were banned for this event only. The commentators were not aware of this last minute rule that was made to prevent the cancellation of the event due to local political pressures. Referee [[John McCarthy (referee)|\"Big John\" McCarthy]] made repeated warnings to the fighters to \"open the hand\" when this rule was violated. However, not one fighter was reprimanded. UFC 9 was also the last UFC event to feature the superfight.\n*''[[Ultimate Ultimate 1996]]'' \u2013 This event was the first to introduce the \"no grabbing of the fence\" rule.\n*''[[UFC 12]]'' \u2013 The main tournament split into a heavyweight (over 200&nbsp;lbs.) and lightweight (200&nbsp;lbs. and under) division; and the eight-man tournament ceased. Fighters now needed to win only two fights to win the competition. The Heavyweight Champion title (and title bouts) was introduced, replacing the Superfight title (albeit matches were still for a time branded as \"Superfights\").\n*''[[UFC 14]]'' \u2013 The lightweight division was re-branded middleweight. The wearing of padded gloves, weighing 110 to 170&nbsp;g (4 to 6&nbsp;ounces), becomes mandatory. Gloves were to be approved by the UFC. Hair-pulling, groin strikes and kicks to a downed opponent became illegal.\n*''[[UFC 15]]'' \u2013 Limits on permissible striking areas were introduced. Headbutts, elbow strikes to the back of the neck and head and small joint manipulation became illegal.\n*''[[UFC 21]]'' \u2013 Five minute rounds were introduced, with preliminary bouts consisting of two rounds, regular non-title bouts at three rounds, and title bouts at five rounds. The \"ten-point must system\" was introduced for scoring fights (identical to the system widely used in boxing).\n* ''[[UFC 28]]'' \u2013 The [[New Jersey State Athletic Control Board]] sanctions its first UFC event, using the newly developed ''[[Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts]]''. Major changes to the UFC's rules included barring knee strikes to the head of a downed opponent, elbow strikes to the spine and neck and punches to the back of the neck and head. Limits on permissible ring attire, stringent medical requirements, and regulatory oversight were also introduced. A new weight class system was also introduced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ivansblog.com/2006/07/mixed-martial-arts-new-jersey.html|title=Ivan's Blog--- Ivan Trembow's Self-Important, Random Rants on Mixed Martial Arts, Video Games, Pro Wrestling, Television, Politics, Sports, and High-Quality Wool Socks|work=ivansblog.com}}</ref> This new set of rules is currently the ''de facto'' standard for MMA events held in the U.S. and is still in use by the UFC.\n* ''[[UFC 31]]'' \u2013 Weight classes are re-aligned to the current standard.

Match outcomes also do not need to be immediately posted publicly, which allows for fight results to remain unknown to the public until the airdate of the episode.\n\nFor two-round matches, if there is a draw after two rounds, an extra five-minute round (\"[[sudden victory]]\") is contested. If the extra round concludes without a stoppage, the judges' decision will be based on that final round.\n\nThese exhibition matches variably have two or three rounds, depending on the rules used for each season. In most seasons, preliminary matches (before the semi-final bouts) were two rounds; in season two, all matches had three rounds. All matches past the first round use three rounds as per standard UFC bouts. During the finales for each series, the division finals have the standard three rounds, plus a fourth round if the judges score a tie.\n\n==Weight divisions/Current champions==\n[[File:UFC-Champs.PNG|1000px|thumb|left]]\n{{See also|Mixed martial arts weight classes}}\n{{See also|List of UFC champions}}\n\nThe UFC currently uses nine different weight classes:<ref name=\"ufc.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ufc.com/discover/sport/rules-and-regulations#2|title=Rules and Regulations \u2013 Unified Rules and Other MMA Regulations|publisher=UFC|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105020540/https://www.ufc.com/discover/sport/rules-and-regulations|archivedate=2018-01-05}}</ref>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 80%;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Weight class name\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Minimum Weight (lb)\n!colspan=\"3\"|Upper limit\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Gender\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Current champion\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Date won\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Ref\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Days<br />held \n!rowspan=\"2\"|Defenses\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Next Fight\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Ref\n|-\n!in [[Pound (mass)|pounds]] (lb)\n!in kilograms (kg)\n!in [[Stone (unit)|stone]] (st)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|align=\"left\"|[[Strawweight (MMA)|Strawweight]]\n|None\n|115\n|52.2\n|8&nbsp;st 3&nbsp;lb \n|style=\"background:#F19CBB;|Women \n| style=\"background:#F19CBB;|{{flagicon|CHN}} [[Weili Zhang]]\n| August 31, 2019\n|<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cagesidepress.com/2019/08/31/ufc-shenzhen-results-andrade-vs-zhang/|title=UFC Shenzhen Results: Weili Zhang Shocks With Quick TKO of Andrade, Becomes First Chinese UFC Champ|last=McClory|first=Mike|date=2019-08-31|website=Cageside Press|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-31}}</ref>\n|{{age in days|month1=08|day1=31|year1=2019}}\n| 1\n| (TBA)\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Flyweight (MMA)|Flyweight]]\n|rowspan=2|116\n|rowspan=2|125\n|rowspan=2|56.7\n|rowspan=2|8&nbsp;st 13&nbsp;lb \n|style=\"background:#BBF;

Fighters will typically get paid money to fight, called show money, with an additional bonus if they win, called a win bonus. Despite not being officially confirmed by the UFC, [[Justin Gaethje]] revealed in January 2019 that headlining an event nets additional $25,000 per fighter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mmamania.com/2019/1/28/18201022/ufc-justin-gaethje-case-higher-headliner-pay-pass-away-in-rounds-four-five-mma|author=Adam Guillen Jr.|publisher=mmamania.com|title=Justin Gaethje wants a UFC pay raise in case he dies in the fourth round}}</ref> While fighters new to the UFC can make as little as about $10,000 per fight (without a win bonus), more established fighters have made as much as $500,000 to $1 million per fight. Occasionally, fighters will earn more. For example, at [[UFC 202]], [[Conor McGregor]] made a reported $3 million, a UFC record for one fight, while his opponent [[Nate Diaz]] made a reported $2 million. The combined $5 million made between the fighters was the largest combined fight purse in UFC history.<ref>{{cite web |title=Conor McGregor Breaks Brock Lesnar's Record for Biggest Fight Purse at UFC 202 |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2658946-conor-mcgregor-breaks-brock-lesnars-record-for-biggest-fight-purse-at-ufc-202 |website=BleacherReport.com}}</ref>\n\nCash bonuses are also awarded for \"Fight of the Night\" and \"Performance of the Night\" (formerly awarded separately as \"Knockout of the Night\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmanuts.com/news/ufc-eliminates-ko-submission-night-awards/|title=UFC Eliminates KO and Submission of the Night Awards |publisher=mmanuts.com|author=Dave Walsh |date=February 11, 2014|accessdate= February 11, 2014}}</ref> The size of these bonuses can sometimes be US$80,000 (but are normally US$50,000).

With the {{convert|175|lb|kg|abbr=on}} Royce Gracie winning three of the first four events, the UFC quickly proved that size does not always determine the outcome of the fight.\n\nDuring this early part of the organization, the UFC would showcase a bevy of different styles and fighters. Aside from the aforementioned [[Royce Gracie]], [[Ken Shamrock]], and [[Patrick Smith (fighter)|Patrick Smith]], the competitions also featured competitors such as [[List of halls and walks of fame|Hall of Fame]]r [[Dan Severn]], [[Marco Ruas]], [[Gary Goodridge]], [[Don Frye]], [[Kimo Leopoldo]], [[Oleg Taktarov]], and [[Tank Abbott]]. Although the first events were dominated by jiu-jitsu, other fighting styles became successful: first wrestling, then [[ground and pound]], kickboxing, boxing, and [[Clinch fighting|dirty boxing]], which eventually melded into modern [[mixed martial arts]].\n\nIn April 1995, following ''[[UFC 5]]'' in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], Davie and Gracie sold their interest in the franchise to SEG and disbanded WOW Promotions. Davie continued with SEG as the show's booker and matchmaker, as well as the commissioner of Ultimate Fighting, until December 1997.\n\n====Emergence of stricter rules====\nAlthough UFC used the tagline \"There are no rules\" in the early 1990s, the UFC did in fact operate with limited rules. It banned biting and eye-gouging, and allowed techniques such as hair pulling, [[headbutt]]ing, [[groin attack|groin strikes]], and [[fish-hooking]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn a ''[[UFC 4]]'' qualifying match, competitors Jason Fairn and [[Guy Mezger]] agreed not to pull hair\u2014as they both wore pony tails tied back for the match. That same event saw a matchup between [[Keith Hackney]] and [[Joe Son]] in which Hackney unleashed a series of groin shots against Son while on the ground.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe UFC had a reputation, especially in the early days, as an extremely violent event, as evidenced by a disclaimer in the beginning of the ''[[UFC 5]]'' broadcast which warned audiences of the violent nature of the sport.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n''UFC 5'' also introduced the first singles match, a rematch from the inaugural UFC featuring three-time champion Royce Gracie and Ken Shamrock, called \"The Superfight\". This proved an important development, because singles matches would feature fighters who suffered no prior damage from a previous fight in the same event, unlike tournament matches.

Fighters must participate in the testing pool for at least six months prior to a fight in order to qualify for a UFC event.<ref name=\"mmajunkie.com\"/>  In February 2017, UFC made changes to the anti-doping policy, effective April 1, 2017, as follows: (1) Fighters who are new to the UFC with no previous contract would be subject to a one-month testing rule. The same rule applies to returning fighters who were terminated or whose contracts were not renewed at the decision of the UFC.  Previously, returning or terminated fighters were required to undergo four months of testings prior to competing in a fight. (2)  Returning fighters who have chosen to retire, go on hiatus, or had a non-renewal of their contract,  are required to be in a six-months testing pool prior to competition. (3) No doping violation is handed down to newly signed UFC fighters who voluntarily disclose use of a prohibited substance prior to testing. (4) \"In-competition\" testing begins at noon on the weigh-in day and ends one hour after a fighter clears a post-fight medical for non-selected post-fight testing. For fighters who are subjected to post-fight testing the in-competition testing ends after any post-fight testing is done.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mmaimports.com/2017/03/usada-drug-testing-policies-loosen-up-for-ufc-fighters-heres-the-update/|title=USADA Drug Testing Policies Loosen Up For UFC Fighters, Here's The Update|date=2017-03-29|website=MMA Imports|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2017/12/11/16740288/ufc-usada-loophole-secret-exemptions-from-drug-testing-peds-steroids|title=UFC-USADA loophole could be letting chosen athletes avoid testing in secret|last=Kidd|first=Iain|date=2017-12-11|website=Bloody Elbow|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/sports/ufc-and-usada-make-significant-changes-to-anti-doping-policy|title=UFC and USADA make significant changes to anti-doping policy|date=2017-02-17|website=FoxSports|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2018, indicated no announcements would be made on fighters who have been flagged for a potential doping violation until the entire adjudication processes are conducted with the results of the potential doping violation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lowkickmma.com/ufc-makes-major-changes-to-usada-drug-testing-policy/|title=UFC Makes Major Changes To USADA Drug-Testing Policy|last=Drahota|first=Mike|last2=MMA|first2=LowKick|date=2018-09-29|website=LowKickMMA.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mmanytt.com/ufc/ufc-and-usada-make-major-change-to-anti-doping-policy-going-forward/|title=UFC and USADA Make Major Change to Anti-Doping Policy Going Forward|date=2018-09-29|website=MMAnytt.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref> This came after several cases of fighters, such as [[Anderson Silva]], [[Junior dos Santos]], [[Josh Barnett]] and [[Cris Cyborg]], being flagged for potential doping violations, but cleared after they were proved of unintentional use of [[performance enhancing drug]]s (usually in the form of contaminated supplements).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.mmafighting.com/2018/9/29/17918010/ufc-changes-policy-on-when-it-announces-failed-drug-tests|title=UFC changes policy on when it announces failed drug tests|work=MMA Fighting|access-date=2018-09-29}}</ref> On November 25, 2019, news surfaced that the UFC and USADA had revised their policies, providing a list of certified supplements that will not lead to sanctions should contaminated samples occur.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2019/11/ufc-usada-anti-doping-policy-changes-announced|title=UFC, USADA address contaminated supplements issue with 'significant changes' to anti-doping policy|author=Simon Head|publisher=mmajunkie.com|date=November 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, USADA conducted 353 tests and 2291 tests in 2016 on 586 UFC fighters with [[Anderson Silva]] tested the most of a total of 15 times.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/ufc/gallery/here-are-the-ufc-fighters-usada-tested-the-most-in-2016-022317|title=Here are the UFC fighters USADA tested the most in 2016|last=ET|first=2017 at 3:01p|website=FOX Sports|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref>  In 2017 and 2018 a total of 2818 and 2888 tests were conducted by USADA respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ufc.usada.org/testing/results/testing-numbers/|title=Testing Numbers|website=UFC Anti-Doping Program|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref>\n\nAs of May 16, 2019, a total of  76 UFC fighters have been sanctioned by USADA since the UFC USADA testing program started.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mma-insiders.com/a-quick-look-at-all-usada-banned-ufc-fighters-since-2016-reveals-bellators-problem/|title=A quick look at all USADA banned UFC fighters since 2016 - Reveals Bellator's problem.|date=2019-05-16|website=Combat Arena|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref>\n\n==Rules==\nThe current rules for the Ultimate Fighting Championship were originally established by the [[New Jersey State Athletic Control Board|New Jersey Athletic Control Board]].<ref>[http://www.state.nj.us/lps/sacb/docs/martial.html Mixed Martial Arts Unified Rules of Conduct, Additional Mixed Martial Arts Rules] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403062008/http://www.state.nj.us/lps/sacb/docs/martial.html |date=April 3, 2009 }}, New Jersey Athletic Control Board. Retrieved April 3, 2006.</ref> The set of \"[[Mixed martial arts rules#Unified Rules of MMA|Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts]]\" that New Jersey established has been adopted in other states that regulate mixed martial arts, including Nevada, Louisiana, and California. These rules are also used by many other promotions within the United States, becoming mandatory for those states that have adopted the rules, and so have become the standard ''de facto'' set of rules for professional mixed martial arts across the country.\n\n===Rounds===\nUFC matches vary in maximum length, depending on whether the match is for a Championship title, or  is a fight card's \"main event\" fight. In all fights, each round can be no longer than five minutes.  Championship fights last for a maximum of five rounds. Beginning with [[UFC 138]] on November 5, 2011, non-championship \"main event\" fights (i.e. the final fight on the card) will also last for a maximum of five rounds. Non-main event bouts last for a maximum of three rounds. [[UFC on FX: Alves vs. Kampmann]] featured the organization's first two flyweight fights as part of its first flyweight tournament, which consists of bouts that, in the event of a draw, go to a fourth \"sudden victory\" round held to determine the winner, who advances. There is a one-minute rest period between rounds.\n\n==={{anchor|Octagon}} Cage===\n[[File:Chris Weidman knock out Anderson Silva at UFC 162..jpg|thumb|Shot of the Octagon as [[Chris Weidman]] upsets [[Anderson Silva]] at [[UFC 162]].]]\nThe UFC stages bouts in an eight-sided enclosure officially named \"The Octagon\". Originally, SEG trademarked the concept as well as the term and prevented other mixed martial arts promotions from using the same type of cage, but in 2001 Zuffa gave permission for other promotions to use octagonal cages, reasoning that the young sport needed uniformity to continue to win official sanctioning.

Many fighters still chose to wear tight-fitting shorts or boxing-type trunks, while others wore long pants or singlets. Several wore wrestling shoes. Multi-time tournament Champion [[Royce Gracie]] wore a Brazilian jiu-jitsu [[Keikogi|gi]] in all of his early appearances in UFC (Gracie wore shorts against Matt Hughes at UFC 60), while [[Art Jimmerson]] appeared in UFC 1 wearing one standard boxing glove.  As of [[UFC 133]] there has been a ban on speedo style shorts after [[Dennis Hallman]] wore one in his fight against [[Brian Ebersole]].  UFC president [[Dana White]] was so furious about the fighter's choice of attire that he awarded an honorary \"getting those horrifying shorts off TV as soon as possible\" bonus to Ebersole for finishing the fight in the first round, and in following post-fight interviews made it clear that speedo style shorts will no longer be tolerated.\n\n====Reebok Uniform====\nOn December 2, 2014, the UFC and [[Reebok]] held a press conference to announce an exclusive deal for Reebok to become the worldwide outfitter for the UFC, beginning in July 2015. Financial terms of the six-year partnership were not released, but UFC officials said that though the agreement represents the most valuable non-broadcast contract the company has ever signed, the UFC will not directly profit from the new deal. Instead, company execs said the deal is structured so that the \"vast majority of the revenue\" from the deal \u2013 taking out only the costs associated with administering the new program \u2013 will be paid directly to UFC fighters.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\">{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2014/12/ufc-partners-with-reebok-for-uniform-program-rankings-to-determine-fighter-pay|title=UFC partners with Reebok for uniform program; rankings to determine fighter pay|publisher=mmajunkie.com|author=John Morgan|date=December 2, 2014|accessdate=December 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\nPayment on the new deal was originally expected to be based on the fighter's spot in the official [[UFC rankings]], with the exception of the UFC champions. Fighters ranked No. 1 to 5 would be paid at one level, No. 6 to 10 at a lower level, No. 11 to 15 below that, and unranked fighters at a base rate.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\" /> The payments would remain consistent regardless of where the athletes' bouts air. In addition to the per-fight rate, fighters would also receive royalty payments representing 20 percent of any UFC merchandise sold that bears their likeness. The royalty program would also include retired fighters and continue in perpetuity. The deal itself was reported to be worth 70 million dollars which was what the fighters would be paid over the next six years which is roughly 260 thousand dollars per UFC fight card.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\" /> In April 2015, the UFC announced that they scrapped the rankings idea and that payment will be based on the fighter's number of bouts in the octagon, with different tiers (1-5 fights, 6-10 fights, 11-15 fights, and 16-20 fights). Exceptions are made in the event of title fights, with champions and title challengers receiving greater compensation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2015/04/ufc-fighter-rankings-will-no-longer-determine-reebok-sponsorship-pay|title=UFC: Fighter rankings will no longer determine Reebok sponsorship pay|publisher=mmajunkie.com|author=Steven Marrocco|date=April 20, 2015|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref> The kits were revealed on June 30, 2015. All kits feature the fighter's name on the back of the jersey and fighters have the option to choose between a universal kit or a country kit, related to his nationality. There is also a champion kit, designed to be used only by title holders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2015/06/what-you-need-to-know-about-new-ufc-reebok-fight-kit-uniforms-and-gear|title=What you need to know about new UFC-Reebok 'fight kit' uniforms and gear|publisher=mmajunkie.com|author=Staff|date=June 30, 2015|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe new deal meant that beginning with fight week for [[UFC 189]] in Las Vegas, existing sponsors no longer appear on fighter clothing \u2013 not only on fight night, but also at all pre-fight media appearances \u2013 and in-cage sponsor banners have also eliminated. Fighter camps are outfitted with approved clothing to create a uniform look in athletes' corners. Existing sponsors are still welcome to support UFC fighters. However, third-party logos are no longer allowed on UFC broadcasts, other than title-sponsor slots \u2013 similar to those seen with European soccer clubs \u2013 that the UFC may eventually sell to \"a major, global brand\" down the road.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\" />\n\n===Match outcome===\nMatches may end via:\n*'''[[Submission (combat sport term)|Submission]]''': a fighter clearly taps the mat or his opponent, verbally submits, or clearly communicates being in pain (such as by yelling) to a degree that causes the referee to stop the fight. Also, a technical submission may be called when a fighter either loses consciousness or is on the verge of or suffers serious injury while in a hold.\n*'''[[Knockout]]''': a fighter is put into a state of unconsciousness resulting from any legal strike.\n*'''[[Technical Knockout]]''' (TKO): If the referee decides a fighter cannot continue, the fight is ruled as a technical knockout. Technical knockouts can be classified into three categories:\n**referee stoppage (the referee ends the fight because one fighter is deemed unable to intelligently defend himself)\n**doctor stoppage (a ring side doctor decides that it is unsafe for one fighter to continue the bout, due to excessive bleeding or physical injuries)\n**corner stoppage (a fighter's cornerman signals defeat for his own fighter)\n*'''Judges' Decision''': Depending on scoring, a match may end as:\n**unanimous decision (all three judges score a win for fighter A)\n**majority decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a draw)\n**split decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B)\n**technical decision (a fighter is rendered unable to continue as a result of an unintentional illegal element or move, resulting in a decision based on the finished and unfinished rounds if the number of rounds to be judged is sufficient)\n**unanimous draw (all three judges score a draw)\n**majority draw (two judges score a draw, one judge scoring a win)\n**split draw (one judge scores a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B, and one judge scores a draw)\n**technical draw (the bout ends in a manner similar to that of a technical decision, with the judges' scores resulting in a draw)\n*'''Disqualification''': a fighter intentionally executes an illegal move that is considered by the referee or opponent to be injurious or significant enough to negatively alter the opponent's performance should the fight continue, resulting in the opponent's victory.\n*'''Forfeit''': a fighter fails to compete or intentionally and prematurely ends the bout for a reason besides injury, resulting in the opponent's victory.\n*'''No Contest''': a fighter is rendered unable to continue or compete effectively as a result of an unintentional illegal element or move and there is not a sufficient number of finished rounds to be judged to make a technical decision viable, or both fighters are rendered unable to continue or compete effectively. Also, a fight may be ruled a no contest if the original outcome of the bout is changed due to unsatisfactory or illegal circumstances, such as a premature stoppage or a fighter's testing positive for banned substances.\n\nIn the event of a draw, it is not necessary that the fighters' total ''points'' be equal (see, e.g., ''[[UFC 41]]'' Penn vs. Uno, or ''[[UFC 43]]'' Freeman vs. White). However, in a unanimous or split draw, each fighter does score an equal number of ''win judgments'' from the three judges (0 or 1, respectively). Additionally, if a title fight ends in a draw, the defending champ retains the title.\n\n===Judging criteria===\nThe [[10-point must system|ten-point must system]] is in effect for all UFC fights; three judges score each round and the winner of each receives ten points while the loser receives nine points or fewer (although 10\u201310 rounds are given in the rare event that a judge feels the rounds was too close to warrant giving one fighter 10 and the other 9.)  Scores of 10\u20138 are typically awarded for dominant rounds and anything more dominant is scored less. 10\u20137 rounds are very rare.\n\n===Fouls===\nThe Nevada State Athletic Commission currently lists the following as fouls:<ref>[http://www.leg.state.nv.us/NAC/NAC-467.html NSAC Regulations: Chapter 467 \u2013 Unarmed Combat].

If a foul incapacitates a fighter, then the match may end in a disqualification if the foul was intentional, or a no contest if unintentional. If a foul causes a fighter to be unable to continue later in the bout, it ends with a technical decision win to the injured fighter if the injured fighter is ahead on points, otherwise it is a technical draw.<ref>[http://boxing.nv.gov/docs/MMA%20RULES%20Expained.pdf MMA rules explained.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615195416/http://boxing.nv.gov/docs/MMA%20RULES%20Expained.pdf |date=June 15, 2006 }} Nevada State Athletic Commission. Retrieved June 30, 2006.</ref>\n\n===Match conduct===\n*After a verbal warning the referee can stop the fighters and stand them up if they reach a stalemate on the ground (where neither are in a dominant [[Grappling position|position]] or working towards one). This rule is codified in Nevada as the ''stand-up rule''.\n*If the referee pauses the match, it is resumed with the fighters in their prior positions.\n*Grabbing the cage brings a verbal warning, followed by an attempt by the referee to release the grab by pulling on the grabbing hand. If that attempt fails or if the fighter continues to hold the cage, the referee may charge a foul.\n*Early UFC events disregarded verbal sparring / \"trash-talking\" during matches. Under unified rules, antics are permitted before events to add to excitement and allow fighters to express themselves, but abusive language during combat is prohibited.\n\n===Evolution of the rules===\n*''[[UFC 1]]'' \u2013 Although the advertising said ''There Are No Rules'', there were in fact some rules: no biting, no eye-gouging and no groin attacks. Fights ended only in the event of a knockout, submission or the corner throwing in the towel. Despite this, the first match in ''UFC 1'' was won by referee stoppage, even though it was not officially recognized as such at the time.\n*''[[UFC 2]]'' \u2013 Groin attacks were unbanned. Time limits were dropped ending the need for judges. Modifications to the cage were added (the fence became 5 feet tall but would continually grow in height afterwards and the floor became the canvas that is still used today).\n*''[[UFC 3]]'' \u2013 The referee was officially given the authority to stop a fight in case of a fighter being unable to defend himself. A fighter could not kick if he was wearing shoes. This rule would later be discarded, then changed to 'no kicking with shoes while on the ground' and then reinstated, before finally being discarded.\n*''[[UFC 4]]'' \u2013 After tournament alternate [[Steve Jennum]] won ''UFC 3'' by winning only one bout, alternates (replacements) were required to win a pre-tournament bout to qualify for the role of an alternate.\n*''[[UFC 5]]'' \u2013 The organizers introduced a 30-minute time limit. ''UFC 5'' also saw the first Superfight, a one-off bout between two competitors selected by the organizers with the winner being crowned 'Superfight champion' and having the duty of defending his title at the next UFC.\n*''[[UFC 6]]'' \u2013 The referee was given the authority to restart the fight. If two fighters were entangled in a position where there was a ''lack of action'', the referee could stop the fight and restart the competitors on their feet, in their own corner. In ''UFC 6'' they officially adopted the 5-minute extension to the 30-minute rule which had been used in ''UFC 5''.\n*''[[Ultimate Ultimate 1995]]'' \u2013 This event was the first to introduce the no fish-hooking rule and to reinstate judges. Time limits were changed to 15 minutes in the quarter-finals, 18 minutes in the semi-finals and 27 minutes in the finals.\n*''[[UFC 8]]'' \u2013 Time limits changed to 10 minutes in the first two rounds of the tournament, 15 minutes in the tournament final and Superfight. Time limits would continually change in the later UFC events. Fights could now be decided by a judges decision if the fight reached the end of the time limit. The panel was made up of three judges who simply raised a card with the name of the fighter they considered to be the winner. In this fashion, a draw was not possible since the only two possible outcomes of a decision were 3 to 0 or 2 to 1 in favor of the winner.\n*''[[UFC 9]]'' \u2013 To appease local authorities, closed fisted strikes to the head were banned for this event only. The commentators were not aware of this last minute rule that was made to prevent the cancellation of the event due to local political pressures. Referee [[John McCarthy (referee)|\"Big John\" McCarthy]] made repeated warnings to the fighters to \"open the hand\" when this rule was violated. However, not one fighter was reprimanded. UFC 9 was also the last UFC event to feature the superfight.\n*''[[Ultimate Ultimate 1996]]'' \u2013 This event was the first to introduce the \"no grabbing of the fence\" rule.\n*''[[UFC 12]]'' \u2013 The main tournament split into a heavyweight (over 200&nbsp;lbs.) and lightweight (200&nbsp;lbs. and under) division; and the eight-man tournament ceased. Fighters now needed to win only two fights to win the competition. The Heavyweight Champion title (and title bouts) was introduced, replacing the Superfight title (albeit matches were still for a time branded as \"Superfights\").\n*''[[UFC 14]]'' \u2013 The lightweight division was re-branded middleweight. The wearing of padded gloves, weighing 110 to 170&nbsp;g (4 to 6&nbsp;ounces), becomes mandatory. Gloves were to be approved by the UFC. Hair-pulling, groin strikes and kicks to a downed opponent became illegal.\n*''[[UFC 15]]'' \u2013 Limits on permissible striking areas were introduced. Headbutts, elbow strikes to the back of the neck and head and small joint manipulation became illegal.\n*''[[UFC 21]]'' \u2013 Five minute rounds were introduced, with preliminary bouts consisting of two rounds, regular non-title bouts at three rounds, and title bouts at five rounds. The \"ten-point must system\" was introduced for scoring fights (identical to the system widely used in boxing).\n* ''[[UFC 28]]'' \u2013 The [[New Jersey State Athletic Control Board]] sanctions its first UFC event, using the newly developed ''[[Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts]]''. Major changes to the UFC's rules included barring knee strikes to the head of a downed opponent, elbow strikes to the spine and neck and punches to the back of the neck and head. Limits on permissible ring attire, stringent medical requirements, and regulatory oversight were also introduced. A new weight class system was also introduced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ivansblog.com/2006/07/mixed-martial-arts-new-jersey.html|title=Ivan's Blog--- Ivan Trembow's Self-Important, Random Rants on Mixed Martial Arts, Video Games, Pro Wrestling, Television, Politics, Sports, and High-Quality Wool Socks|work=ivansblog.com}}</ref> This new set of rules is currently the ''de facto'' standard for MMA events held in the U.S. and is still in use by the UFC.\n* ''[[UFC 31]]'' \u2013 Weight classes are re-aligned to the current standard. Bantamweight moves from 150 to 155 and becomes known as [[Lightweight (MMA)|lightweight]]. Lightweight becomes known as [[Welterweight (MMA)|welterweight]], middleweight becomes [[Light Heavyweight (MMA)|light heavyweight]], and a new [[Middleweight (MMA)|middleweight]] class is introduced at 185 pounds. Stools and seconds are first permitted in The Octagon between rounds.\n*''[[UFC 43]]'' \u2013 In the event of a stoppage fights restart in the position the fight was stopped.\n* ''[[UFC 94]]'' \u2013 After an incident where [[Georges St-Pierre]] was accused of putting [[vaseline]] on his back, corner men were disallowed from bringing vaseline into The Octagon.

Match outcomes also do not need to be immediately posted publicly, which allows for fight results to remain unknown to the public until the airdate of the episode.\n\nFor two-round matches, if there is a draw after two rounds, an extra five-minute round (\"[[sudden victory]]\") is contested. If the extra round concludes without a stoppage, the judges' decision will be based on that final round.\n\nThese exhibition matches variably have two or three rounds, depending on the rules used for each season. In most seasons, preliminary matches (before the semi-final bouts) were two rounds; in season two, all matches had three rounds. All matches past the first round use three rounds as per standard UFC bouts. During the finales for each series, the division finals have the standard three rounds, plus a fourth round if the judges score a tie.\n\n==Weight divisions/Current champions==\n[[File:UFC-Champs.PNG|1000px|thumb|left]]\n{{See also|Mixed martial arts weight classes}}\n{{See also|List of UFC champions}}\n\nThe UFC currently uses nine different weight classes:<ref name=\"ufc.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ufc.com/discover/sport/rules-and-regulations#2|title=Rules and Regulations \u2013 Unified Rules and Other MMA Regulations|publisher=UFC|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105020540/https://www.ufc.com/discover/sport/rules-and-regulations|archivedate=2018-01-05}}</ref>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 80%;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Weight class name\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Minimum Weight (lb)\n!colspan=\"3\"|Upper limit\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Gender\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Current champion\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Date won\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Ref\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Days<br />held \n!rowspan=\"2\"|Defenses\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Next Fight\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Ref\n|-\n!in [[Pound (mass)|pounds]] (lb)\n!in kilograms (kg)\n!in [[Stone (unit)|stone]] (st)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|align=\"left\"|[[Strawweight (MMA)|Strawweight]]\n|None\n|115\n|52.2\n|8&nbsp;st 3&nbsp;lb \n|style=\"background:#F19CBB;|Women \n| style=\"background:#F19CBB;|{{flagicon|CHN}} [[Weili Zhang]]\n| August 31, 2019\n|<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cagesidepress.com/2019/08/31/ufc-shenzhen-results-andrade-vs-zhang/|title=UFC Shenzhen Results: Weili Zhang Shocks With Quick TKO of Andrade, Becomes First Chinese UFC Champ|last=McClory|first=Mike|date=2019-08-31|website=Cageside Press|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-31}}</ref>\n|{{age in days|month1=08|day1=31|year1=2019}}\n| 1\n| (TBA)\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Flyweight (MMA)|Flyweight]]\n|rowspan=2|116\n|rowspan=2|125\n|rowspan=2|56.7\n|rowspan=2|8&nbsp;st 13&nbsp;lb \n|style=\"background:#BBF;

Fighters will typically get paid money to fight, called show money, with an additional bonus if they win, called a win bonus. Despite not being officially confirmed by the UFC, [[Justin Gaethje]] revealed in January 2019 that headlining an event nets additional $25,000 per fighter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mmamania.com/2019/1/28/18201022/ufc-justin-gaethje-case-higher-headliner-pay-pass-away-in-rounds-four-five-mma|author=Adam Guillen Jr.|publisher=mmamania.com|title=Justin Gaethje wants a UFC pay raise in case he dies in the fourth round}}</ref> While fighters new to the UFC can make as little as about $10,000 per fight (without a win bonus), more established fighters have made as much as $500,000 to $1 million per fight. Occasionally, fighters will earn more. For example, at [[UFC 202]], [[Conor McGregor]] made a reported $3 million, a UFC record for one fight, while his opponent [[Nate Diaz]] made a reported $2 million. The combined $5 million made between the fighters was the largest combined fight purse in UFC history.<ref>{{cite web |title=Conor McGregor Breaks Brock Lesnar's Record for Biggest Fight Purse at UFC 202 |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2658946-conor-mcgregor-breaks-brock-lesnars-record-for-biggest-fight-purse-at-ufc-202 |website=BleacherReport.com}}</ref>\n\nCash bonuses are also awarded for \"Fight of the Night\" and \"Performance of the Night\" (formerly awarded separately as \"Knockout of the Night\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmanuts.com/news/ufc-eliminates-ko-submission-night-awards/|title=UFC Eliminates KO and Submission of the Night Awards |publisher=mmanuts.com|author=Dave Walsh |date=February 11, 2014|accessdate= February 11, 2014}}</ref> The size of these bonuses can sometimes be US$80,000 (but are normally US$50,000).

{"title_page": "British Poetry Revival", "text_new": "{{ref improve|date=February 2014}}\n\"'''The British Poetry Revival'''\" is the general name given to a loose [[poetry]] [[Literary movement|movement]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] that took place in the 1960s and 1970s. The revival was a [[modernist poetry|modernist]]-inspired reaction to [[The Movement (literature)|the Movement's]] more conservative approach to British poetry. The poets included [[Bob Cobbing]], [[Paula Claire]], [[Tom Raworth]], [[Eric Mottram]], [[Jeff Nuttall]], [[Andrew Crozier]], Paul Buck, [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[Allen Fisher]], [[Lee Harwood]], [[Iain Sinclair]], [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]], [[John James (poet)|John James]], Gilbert Adair, [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], Ulli Freer, [[Ken Edwards]], [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], Gavin Selerie, Frances Presley, Elaine Randell, [[Robert Sheppard]], [[Adrian Clarke (poet)|Adrian Clarke]], [[Clive Fencott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], [[Cris Cheek]], [[Tony Lopez (poet)|Tony Lopez]] and [[Denise Riley]].<ref> Eric Mottram, 'The British Poetry Revival', Robert Hampson & Peter Barry (eds), ''New British poetries: The scope of the possible'' (Manchester University Press, 1993). </ref>\n\n==Beginnings==\nIf the Movement poets looked to [[Thomas Hardy]] as a poetic model, the poets associated with the British Poetry Revival were more likely to look to modernist models, such as the American poets [[Ezra Pound]] and [[William Carlos Williams]] and British figures such as [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]], [[Basil Bunting]] and [[Hugh MacDiarmid]]. Although these major British poets had effectively been written out of official histories of 20th century British poetry, by the beginning of the 1960s a number of younger poets were starting to explore poetic possibilities that the older writers had opened up.\n\nThese poets included [[Roy Fisher]], [[Gael Turnbull]], [[Ian Hamilton Finlay]], [[Bob Cobbing]], [[Jeff Nuttall]], [[Tom Raworth]], [[Michael Horovitz]], [[Eric Mottram]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], [[Edwin Morgan (poet)|Edwin Morgan]], [[Jim Burns (poet)|Jim Burns]], [[Elaine Feinstein]], [[Lee Harwood]], Dick Russell and [[Christopher Logue]]. Many of these poets joined [[Allen Ginsberg]] and an audience of 7,000 people at the Albert Hall [[International Poetry Incarnation]] on 11 June 1965 to create what has often been claimed as the first British [[happening]]. Earlier British happenings included [[John Latham (artist)|John Latham]]'s event-based art and Skoob Tower ceremonies; [[Gustav Metzger]]'s 1964 auto-destructive art; [[Adrian Henri]]'s 1962 collage-events in Liverpool's Cavern Club; and [[Jeff Nuttall]]'s events in Better Books. They had their roots in [[Dada]] events at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich)]] at the start of the century.<ref> Jeff Nuttall, ''Bomb Culture'' </ref> \n\nThese poets provided a wide range of modes and models of how modernism could be integrated into British poetry. Fisher, also a professional jazz pianist, applied the lessons of [[William Carlos Williams]]' ''[[Paterson (poem)|Paterson]]'' to his native [[Birmingham]] in his long poem ''City''. Turnbull, who spent some time in the U. S., was also influenced by Williams. His fellow [[Scottish literature|Scots]] Morgan and Finlay both worked with [[found poetry|found]], [[sound poetry|sound]] and [[visual poetry]]. Mottram, Nuttall, Horovitz and Burns were all close to the [[Beat generation]] writers. Mottram and Raworth were also influenced by the [[Black Mountain poets]] while Raworth and Harwood shared an interest in the poets of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]].\n\nA number of publishing outlets for this new experimental poetry also began to spring up, including Turnbull's Migrant Press, Raworth's Matrix Press and Goliard Press, Horovitz's ''New Departures'', Stuart Montgomery's [[Fulcrum Press]], [[Tim Longville]]'s ''[[Grosseteste Review]]'', Galloping Dog Press and its ''[[Poetry Information]]'' magazine, Pig Press, [[Andrew Crozier]] and [[Peter Riley]]'s ''[[The English Intelligencer]]'', Crozier's Ferry Press, and Cobbing's [[Writers Forum]]. In addition to the poets of the revival, many of these presses and magazines also published ''avant-garde'' American and European poetry. The first anthology to present a wide-ranging selection of the new movement was Horovitz's ''[[Children of Albion: Poetry of the Underground in Britain]]'' (1969). A better sample of the work of the first and second generations of the Revival is provided by the sections edited by Eric Mottram and Ken Edwards in ''the new british poetry'' (1988).\n\n==London==\n\nThanks in no small part to Cobbing's [[Writers Forum]] and its associated writers' workshop, [[London]] was a hub for many young poets, including [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[Paula Claire]], [[Allen Fisher]], [[Iain Sinclair]], Gilbert Adair, [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], [[Ulli Freer]], Gavin Selerie, Frances Presley, [[Elaine Randell]], [[Robert Sheppard]], [[Adrian Clarke (poet)|Adrian Clarke]], [[Clive Fencott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], [[cris cheek]], [[Tony Lopez (poet)|Tony Lopez]] and [[Denise Riley]]. Some sense of the atmosphere of this period is provided by the series of reminiscences included in 'CLASP: late modernist poetry in London' (Shearsman, 2016), edited by Robert Hampson and Ken Edwards,<ref> Robert Hampson & Ken Edwards (eds), ''CLASP: late modernist poetry in London'' (Shearsman, 2016)</ref> and in Ken Edwards's memoir, ''Wild Metrics''.<ref> Ken Edwards, ''Wild Metrics'' (Grand Iota, 2019).</ref>\n\nGriffiths writes a poetry of dazzling surface and deep political commitment that incorporates such matter as his professional knowledge of [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] and his years as a [[Hells Angel]]. Both Sinclair and Fisher share a taste for [[William Blake]] and an interest in exploring the meaning of place, particularly London, which can be seen in Sinclair's ''Suicide Bridge'' and ''Lud Heat'' and Fisher's ''Place'' sequence of books. O'Sullivan explores a view of the poet as shaman in her work, while Randell and Riley were among the first British [[list of women poets|women poets]] to combine [[feminist]] concerns with experimental poetic practice. For more on Griffiths's poetry, see William Rowe (ed.), ''Bill Griffiths'' (Salt, 2007).\n\nGriffiths started Pirate Press to publish work by himself and others. Allen Fisher set up Spanner for similar reasons, and Sinclair's early books were published by his own Albion Village Press, which also published work by Chris Torrance and Brian Catling. Book production has always been an important part of Revival practice. Many of these writers also participated enthusiastically in performance poetry events, both individually or in groups like Cobbing's Bird Yak and Konkrete Canticle.\n\nEric Mottram was a central figure on the London scene, both for his personal and professional knowledge of the [[Beat generation]] writers and the US poets linked with the New American Poetry more generally, and his abilities as a promoter and poet. In large part through Mottram's presence there, King's College London was another important site for the British Poetry Revival. Poets who attended there (a number of them also students taught by Mottram) included Gilbert Adair, Peter Barry, [[Sean Bonney]], Hannah Bramness, Clive Bush, [[Ken Edwards]], Bill Griffiths, [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], [[Jeff Hilson]], Will Rowe, and [[Lawrence Upton]].\n\n==Northumbria and Northern England==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}\nBy the early 1950s, Basil Bunting had returned to live in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and, in 1966, Fulcrum Press published ''[[Briggflatts]]'', which is widely considered to be his masterpiece.<ref>Carroll F. Terrell, 'Introduction', ''Basil Bunting: Man and Poet'' (Maine: National Poetry Foundation, 1980), 1.</ref>   A number of younger poets began to gather around Bunting. In 1963, [[Connie Pickard|Connie]] and [[Tom Pickard]] started a reading series and bookshop in the [[Morden Tower Book Room]].<ref>Geraldine Monk (ed.), ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Bristol: Shearsman, 2012). </ref> The first reading was by Bunting, and Ginsberg, [[Robert Creeley]], [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]] and [[Gregory Corso]] all read there. They were soon joined by [[Richard Caddel]], brought up in [[Kent]] but an honorary Northumbrian, [[Barry MacSweeney]] and [[Colin Simms]]. For some reminiscences of this scene, see the essays by Connie Pickard, [[Tony Baker (poet)|Tony Baker]], and [[Tom Pickard]] in Geraldine Monk (ed.) ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Shearsman, 2012).\n\nThrough Bunting, these younger writers became familiar with the work of the [[Objectivist poets]]. Specifically, [[Louis Zukofsky]] and [[Lorine Niedecker]] were to become important models for Caddel and Simms in their writing about the Northumbrian environment, while John Seed picked up on [[George Oppen]].<ref>John Seed, 'Living the Storm: George Oppen's \"Songs of Experience\"' in John Freeman (ed.) ''Not Comforts / But Vision: Essays on the poetry of George Oppen'' (Interim Press, 1985), 10-25</ref> Pickard and MacSweeney shared Bunting's interest in reviving Northumbrian vowel patterns and verbal music in poetry and all of these poets were influenced by the older poet's insistence on poetry as sounded speech rather than purely written text.\n\nAt [[Easter]], 1967 MacSweeney organised the [[Sparty Lea]] Poetry Festival. This was a ten-day session of reading, writing and discussion. The participants, including the Pickards, MacSweeney, Andrew Crozier, [[John James (poet)|John James]], [[John Temple (poet)|John Temple]], [[Pete Armstrong]], [[Tim Longville]], Peter Riley, [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]], [[J. H. Prynne]] and [[Nick Waite]], stayed in a group of four cottages in the village of Sparty Lea.<ref>Luke Roberts, ''Barry MacSweeney and the Politics of Post-War British Poetry'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2017), 4-6.</ref> This has often been presented as a pivotal event in the British Poetry Revival, bringing together poets who were separated geographically and in terms of poetic influences and encouraging them to support and publish each other's work.\n\nAlthough published by Writers Forum and Pirate Press, [[Geraldine Monk]] is very much a poet of the North of England. Like [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], she writes for performance as much as for the page and there is an undercurrent of feminist concerns in her work. Other poets associated with the North of England included Paul Buck, Glenda George, and John Seed. Paul Buck and Glenda George for many years edited Curtains, a magazine instrumental in disseminating contemporary French poetry and philosophical/theoretical writing. John Seed had picked up on Objectivism while still in the North-East. Geraldine Monk's edited collection of reminiscences by various Northern poets (including [[Jim Burns]], [[Paul Buck]], [[Glenda George]], and [[John Seed]], ''CUSP'', mentioned above, provides a rich account of innovative poetry outside the metropolis.<ref> Geraldine Monk, ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Shearsman, 2012).</ref>\n\n==Cambridge==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}\nThe Cambridge poets were a group centred around [[J. H. Prynne]] and included [[Andrew Crozier]], [[John James (poet)|John James]], [[Douglas Oliver]], [[Veronica Forrest-Thomson]], [[Peter Riley]], Tim Longville and [[John Riley (poet)|John Riley]]. Prynne was influenced by [[Charles Olson]] and Crozier was partly responsible for [[Carl Rakosi]]'s return to poetry in the 1960s. The New York school were also an important influence for many of the Cambridge poets - most obviously in the work of John James. The ''Grosseteste Review'', which published these poets, was originally thought of as a kind of magazine of British Objectivism.\n\nThe Cambridge poets in general wrote in a cooler, more measured style than many of their London or Northumbrian peers (although Barry MacSweeney, for example, felt an affinity with them) and many taught at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] or at [[Anglia Polytechnic University|Anglia Polytechnic]]. There was also less emphasis on performance than there was among the London poets.\n\n==Wales and Scotland==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}\nIn the 60s and early 70s Peter Finch, an associate of Bob Cobbing, ran the No Walls Poetry readings and the ground breaking inclusive magazine, ''second aeon''.  He began Oriel Books in [[Cardiff]] in 1974 and the shop served as a focal point for young [[Welsh literature in English|Welsh]] poets. However, some of the more experimental poets in Wales were not of Welsh origins. Two of the most important expatriate poets operating in Wales were [[John Freeman (poet)|John Freeman]] and [[Chris Torrance]]. Freeman is another British poet influenced by the Objectivists, and he has written on both [[George Oppen]] and Niedecker.In 1985, he edited ''Not Comforts / but Visions'', essays on the poetry of George Oppen, which included work by John Seed, [[Jeremy Hooker]], Freeman, Hampson and others.<ref>John Freeman (ed.), ''Not Comforts  / But Vision: essays on the Poetry of George Oppen'' (Interim Press, 1985).</ref> Torrance has expressed his debt to David Jones. His ongoing ''Magic Door'' sequence is widely regarded as one of the major long poems to come out of the Revival. For some account of this period, see the reminiscences of Chris Torrance and Peter Finch in Geraldine Monk's CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition (Shearsman, 2012).\n\nIn Scotland, Edwin Morgan, Ian Hamilton Finlay and [[Tom Leonard (poet)|Tom Leonard]] emerged as key individual poets during this time, each interested in, among other forms, sound and visual poetry. The viability of a wider, deeper experimental infrastructure in poetry was helped by the gallery, performance space and bookshop at the [[Third Eye Centre]] in Glasgow (later renamed the [[CCA Glasgow|Centre for Contemporary Arts]]). Magazines such as ''Scottish International'', \"Chapman\", and Duncan Glen's magazine ''Akros'' maintained links with the modernist legacy of the inter-war and post-war years while publishing contemporary poets; often, however, by mixing the avant-garde with aesthetically conservative texts.\n\nIn the same vein, in 1972-4 John Schofield, then a post-graduate student, organised three annual poetry festivals in various halls at Edinburgh University, called POEM 72, POEM73 and POEM74. Poets reading their work at the first included Edwin Morgan, Norman MacCaig, Tom Buchan, Robert Garioch and Liz Lochhead. About 700 people attended. For POEM73, the attendance was over 1300 people, hearing Hugh MacDiarmid, George Macbeth, Adrian Mitchell, Jon Silkin and Iain Crichton Smith. The final festival, POEM74, included readings by Adrian Henri, Libby Houston, Jeff Nuttall, Rose McGuire, Frances Horovitz, Ruth Fainlight and Sorley Maclean.\n\n==\"A treacherous assault on British poetry\"==\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Towards Design In Poetry.jpg|thumb|Eric Mottram's ''Towards design in poetry'' (writers forum, 1977)]] -->\n\nIn 1971, a large number of the poets associated with the British Poetry Revival joined the dormant, if not moribund [[Poetry Society]] and in the elections became the Poetry Society's new council. The Society had been traditionally hostile to modernist poetry, but under the new council this position was reversed. Eric Mottram was made editor of the society's magazine ''Poetry Review''. Over the next six years, he edited twenty issues that featured most, if not all, of the key Revival poets and carried reviews of books and magazines from the wide range of small presses that had sprung up to publish them.\n\nNuttall and MacSweeney both served as chairperson of the society during this period and Bob Cobbing used the photocopying facilities in the basement of the society's building to produce Writers Forum books. Around this time, Cobbing, Finch and others established the [[Association of Little Presses]] (ALP) to promote and support small press publishers and organise book fairs at which they could sell their productions.\n\nIn the late 1970s, in response to the number of foreign poets being featured in ''Poetry Review'', Mottram was removed as editor of the magazine; his editorial practices being seen by the Arts Council as \"a treacherous assault on British poetry\", according to Mottram's preface to his section of the anthology, ''the new british poetry''. At the same time, the Arts Council set up an inquiry that overturned the result of the Society's elections that had once more brought in a council dominated by those sympathetic to the Poetry Revival.<ref>For a detailed account of these events, see Peter Barry, The Battle of Earl's Court (Manchester University Press, 2007).</ref>\n\n==The 1980s and after==\n\nA number of younger poets, many of whom who first found an outlet in ''Poetry Review'' under Mottram, began to emerge around the end of the 1970s. In London, [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[Ulli Freer]], [[cris cheek]], [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], [[Robert Sheppard]], and [[Ken Edwards]] were among those who were to the fore. These, and others, met regularly at [[Gilbert Adair]]'s Subvoicive reading series, which also regularly featured poets from North America, as well as visiting poets such as [[Caroline Bergvall]], [[Paul Buck]], [[Andrew Duncan (poet)|Andrew Duncan]], [[D. S. Marriott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]] and [[Denise Riley]]. Edwards ran ''Reality Studios'', a magazine that grew out of [[Alembic (UK poetry magazine)]], the magazine he had co-edited through the 1970s with Peter Barry and Robert Hampson. Through Reality Studios, he helped introduce the [[Language poets|L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets]] to a British readership. He also ran Reality Street Editions with Cambridge-based [[Wendy Mulford]], which continued to be a major publisher of contemporary poetry until 2018 and an important bridge between US and UK poetries. The London-based [[Angel Exhaust]] magazine brought many of the younger poets together - in particular, Adrian Clarke, [[Robert Sheppard]] and [[Andrew_Duncan_(poet)|Andrew Duncan]]. In the Midlands, Tony Baker's ''Figs'' magazine focused more on the Objectivist and Bunting-inspired poetry of the Northumbrian school while introducing a number of new poets.\n\nIn 1988 an anthology called ''[[The New British Poetry]]'' was published. It featured a section on the Revival poets edited by Mottram and another on the younger poets edited by Edwards. In 1987, Crozier and Longville published their anthology ''A Various Art'', which focused mainly on the Cambridge poets, and Iain Sinclair edited yet another anthology of Revival-related work ''[[Conductors of Chaos]]'' (1996). For an account of some of the work produced by these poets, see Robert Hampson and Peter Barry (eds.), ''The New British poetries: the scope of the possible'' (Manchester University Press, 1993). In 1994 [[W. N. Herbert]] and [[Richard Price]] co-edited the anthology of Scottish [[Informationist poetry]] ''Contraflow on the SuperHighway'' (Gairfish and Southfields Press).\n\nThe anthology ''[[Conductors of Chaos]]'' featured another aspect of the Revival; the recovery of neglected British modernists of the generation after Bunting. Poets [[David Gascoyne]], selected by Jeremy Reed; [[W. S. Graham]], selected by Tony Lopez; [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]], selected by [[Drew Milne]]; [[J.F. Hendry]], selected by Andrew Crozier and [[Nicholas Moore]], selected by Peter Riley were reappraised and returned to their rightful place in the history of 20th century British poetry. Another interesting development was the establishment of the British and Irish poetry discussion list by Richard Caddel. This continues to provide an international forum for discussion and the exchange of news on experimental British and Irish poetry. Much wider publication for Revival poetry was arranged via the USA. Caddel, together with Peter Middleton, edited a selection of new UK poetry for US readers in a special issue of ''Talisman'' (1996).<ref>''Talisman: a Journal of Contemporary Poetry and Poetics'' 16 (1996): 110-173.</ref> With [[Peter Quartermain]] Caddel also edited ''[[Other: British and Irish Poetry since 1970]]'' (USA, 1999); while Keith Tuma's ''[[Anthology of Twentieth-Century British and Irish Poetry]]'' (Oxford University Press, USA, 2001) incorporates this poetry into a wider retrospective of the whole century.\n\nInto the 1990s and beyond poets such as [[Johan de Wit (poet)]], [[Sean Bonney]], [[Jeff Hilson]], and [[Piers Hugill]] have surfaced after direct involvement in the Cobbing-led [[Writers Forum]] workshop.  An interesting sub-development of the workshop was the instigation of the Foro De Escritores workshop, in Santiago Chile, run on similar aesthetic principles. This workshop has contributed to the development of [[Martin Gubbins (poet)|Martin Gubbins]], [[Andreas Aandwandter]], and [[Martin Bakero]], to name but few. Those associated with the [[Barque Press]] (most obviously [[Andrea Brady]] and [[Keston Sutherland]]), and more recently [[Bad Press]] (in particular, [[Marianne Morris]] and [[Jow Lindsay]]), have made a similar impact via the Cambridge scene. [[Perdika Press]] in North London has been instrumental in bringing to wider attention contemporary Modernist writers such as Nicholas Potamitis, Mario Petrucci, Robert Vas Dias and Peter Brennan; the press was also responsible for the first publication in Britain of [[Bill Berkson]]. From Scotland, [[Peter Manson]], who had co-edited the magazine ''Object Permanence'' in the mid-1990s, [[Drew Milne]], editor of ''Parataxis'', [[David Kinloch]] and [[Richard Price]] (previously editors of ''Verse'' and ''Southfields'') also emerged more fully as poets in their own right. New writings have arisen from the involvement of [[cris cheek]], [[Bridgid Mcleer]], and [[Alaric Sumner]], under the direction of [[Caroline Bergvall]] and [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]] through the [[Performance Writing]] programme at [[Dartington College of Arts]] including [[Kirsten Lavers]], [[Andy Smith (poet)|Andy Smith]], and Chris Paul; from the involvement of [[Redell Olsen]] in the MA in Poetic Practice at Royal Holloway, University of London, including Becky Cremin, Frances Kruk, Ryan Ormond, [[Sophie Robinson]], John Sparrow and Stephen Willey; and through [[Keith Jebb]] at University of Bedfordshire's Creative Writing programme, including [[Alyson Torns]] and [[Allison Boast]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|1960s}}\n*[[Black Mountain poets]]\n*[[Language poetry]]\n*[[movement (literature)|The Movement]]\n*[[Situationist International|Situationism]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20011110105655/http://www.netkonect.net/~athelstan/links.html List of related links]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20091130021251/http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/fales/english.html The English Intelligencer Archive]\n*[http://www.mordentower.org/ The Morden Tower]\n*[http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/lists/british-irish-poets.html Archives of the British and Irish poetry discussion list]\n*[http://www.jeff-nuttall.co.uk The Life and Works of Jeff Nuttall]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080225010840/http://www.fucine.com/network/fucinemute/core/print.php?url=archivio%2Ffm87%2Fhugill.htm&id=1374 Piers Hugill on British Poetry since 1977]\n\n{{Schools of poetry}}\n\n[[Category:Literary movements]]\n[[Category:British poetry]]\n[[Category:British literary movements]]\n[[Category:British Poetry Revival| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{ref improve|date=February 2014}}\n\"'''The British Poetry Revival'''\" is the general name given to a loose [[poetry]] [[Literary movement|movement]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] that took place in the 1960s and 1970s. The revival was a [[modernist poetry|modernist]]-inspired reaction to [[The Movement (literature)|the Movement's]] more conservative approach to British poetry. The poets included [[Bob Cobbing]], [[Paula Claire]], [[Tom Raworth]], [[Eric Mottram]], [[Jeff Nuttall]], [[Andrew Crozier]], Paul Buck, [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[Allen Fisher]], [[Lee Harwood]], [[Iain Sinclair]], [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]], [[John James (poet)|John James]], Gilbert Adair, [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], Ulli Freer, [[Ken Edwards]], [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], Gavin Selerie, Frances Presley, Elaine Randell, [[Robert Sheppard]], [[Adrian Clarke (poet)|Adrian Clarke]], [[Clive Fencott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], [[Cris Cheek]], [[Tony Lopez (poet)|Tony Lopez]] and [[Denise Riley]].<ref> Eric Mottram, 'The British Poetry Revival', Robert Hampson & Peter Barry (eds), ''New British poetries: The scope of the possible'' (Manchester University Press, 1993). </ref>\n\n==Beginnings==\nIf the Movement poets looked to [[Thomas Hardy]] as a poetic model, the poets associated with the British Poetry Revival were more likely to look to modernist models, such as the American poets [[Ezra Pound]] and [[William Carlos Williams]] and British figures such as [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]], [[Basil Bunting]] and [[Hugh MacDiarmid]]. Although these major British poets had effectively been written out of official histories of 20th century British poetry, by the beginning of the 1960s a number of younger poets were starting to explore poetic possibilities that the older writers had opened up.\n\nThese poets included [[Roy Fisher]], [[Gael Turnbull]], [[Ian Hamilton Finlay]], [[Bob Cobbing]], [[Jeff Nuttall]], [[Tom Raworth]], [[Michael Horovitz]], [[Eric Mottram]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], [[Edwin Morgan (poet)|Edwin Morgan]], [[Jim Burns (poet)|Jim Burns]], [[Elaine Feinstein]], [[Lee Harwood]], Dick Russell and [[Christopher Logue]]. Many of these poets joined [[Allen Ginsberg]] and an audience of 7,000 people at the Albert Hall [[International Poetry Incarnation]] on 11 June 1965 to create what has often been claimed as the first British [[happening]]. Earlier British happenings included [[John Latham (artist)|John Latham]]'s event-based art and Skoob Tower ceremonies; [[Gustav Metzger]]'s 1964 auto-destructive art; [[Adrian Henri]]'s 1962 collage-events in Liverpool's Cavern Club; and [[Jeff Nuttall]]'s events in Better Books. They had their roots in [[Dada]] events at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich)]] at the start of the century.<ref> Jeff Nuttall, ''Bomb Culture'' </ref> \n\nThese poets provided a wide range of modes and models of how modernism could be integrated into British poetry. Fisher, also a professional jazz pianist, applied the lessons of [[William Carlos Williams]]' ''[[Paterson (poem)|Paterson]]'' to his native [[Birmingham]] in his long poem ''City''. Turnbull, who spent some time in the U. S., was also influenced by Williams. His fellow [[Scottish literature|Scots]] Morgan and Finlay both worked with [[found poetry|found]], [[sound poetry|sound]] and [[visual poetry]]. Mottram, Nuttall, Horovitz and Burns were all close to the [[Beat generation]] writers. Mottram and Raworth were also influenced by the [[Black Mountain poets]] while Raworth and Harwood shared an interest in the poets of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]].\n\nA number of publishing outlets for this new experimental poetry also began to spring up, including Turnbull's Migrant Press, Raworth's Matrix Press and Goliard Press, Horovitz's ''New Departures'', Stuart Montgomery's [[Fulcrum Press]], [[Tim Longville]]'s ''[[Grosseteste Review]]'', Galloping Dog Press and its ''[[Poetry Information]]'' magazine, Pig Press, [[Andrew Crozier]] and [[Peter Riley]]'s ''[[The English Intelligencer]]'', Crozier's Ferry Press, and Cobbing's [[Writers Forum]]. In addition to the poets of the revival, many of these presses and magazines also published ''avant-garde'' American and European poetry. The first anthology to present a wide-ranging selection of the new movement was Horovitz's ''[[Children of Albion: Poetry of the Underground in Britain]]'' (1969).\n\n==London==\n\nThanks in no small part to Cobbing's [[Writers Forum]] and its associated writers' workshop, [[London]] was a hub for many young poets, including [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[Paula Claire]], [[Allen Fisher]], [[Iain Sinclair]], Gilbert Adair, [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], [[Ulli Freer]], Gavin Selerie, Frances Presley, [[Elaine Randell]], [[Robert Sheppard]], [[Adrian Clarke (poet)|Adrian Clarke]], [[Clive Fencott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], [[cris cheek]], [[Tony Lopez (poet)|Tony Lopez]] and [[Denise Riley]]. Some sense of the atmosphere of this period is provided by the series of reminiscences included in 'CLASP: late modernist poetry in London' (Shearsman, 2016), edited by Robert Hampson and Ken Edwards,<ref> Robert Hampson & Ken Edwards (eds), ''CLASP: late modernist poetry in London'' (Shearsman, 2016)</ref> and in Ken Edwards's memoir, ''Wild Metrics''.<ref> Ken Edwards, ''Wild Metrics'' (Grand Iota, 2019).</ref>\n\nGriffiths writes a poetry of dazzling surface and deep political commitment that incorporates such matter as his professional knowledge of [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] and his years as a [[Hells Angel]]. Both Sinclair and Fisher share a taste for [[William Blake]] and an interest in exploring the meaning of place, particularly London, which can be seen in Sinclair's ''Suicide Bridge'' and ''Lud Heat'' and Fisher's ''Place'' sequence of books. O'Sullivan explores a view of the poet as shaman in her work, while Randell and Riley were among the first British [[list of women poets|women poets]] to combine [[feminist]] concerns with experimental poetic practice. For more on Griffiths's poetry, see William Rowe (ed.), ''Bill Griffiths'' (Salt, 2007).\n\nGriffiths started Pirate Press to publish work by himself and others. Allen Fisher set up Spanner for similar reasons, and Sinclair's early books were published by his own Albion Village Press, which also published work by Chris Torrance and Brian Catling. Book production has always been an important part of Revival practice. Many of these writers also participated enthusiastically in performance poetry events, both individually or in groups like Cobbing's Bird Yak and Konkrete Canticle.\n\nEric Mottram was a central figure on the London scene, both for his personal and professional knowledge of the [[Beat generation]] writers and the US poets linked with the New American Poetry more generally, and his abilities as a promoter and poet. In large part through Mottram's presence there, King's College London was another important site for the British Poetry Revival. Poets who attended there (a number of them also students taught by Mottram) included Gilbert Adair, Peter Barry, [[Sean Bonney]], Hannah Bramness, Clive Bush, [[Ken Edwards]], Bill Griffiths, [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], [[Jeff Hilson]], Will Rowe, and [[Lawrence Upton]].\n\n==Northumbria and Northern England==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}\nBy the early 1950s, Basil Bunting had returned to live in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and, in 1966, Fulcrum Press published ''[[Briggflatts]]'', which is widely considered to be his masterpiece.<ref>Carroll F. Terrell, 'Introduction', ''Basil Bunting: Man and Poet'' (Maine: National Poetry Foundation, 1980), 1.</ref>   A number of younger poets began to gather around Bunting. In 1963, [[Connie Pickard|Connie]] and [[Tom Pickard]] started a reading series and bookshop in the [[Morden Tower Book Room]].<ref>Geraldine Monk (ed.), ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Bristol: Shearsman, 2012). </ref> The first reading was by Bunting, and Ginsberg, [[Robert Creeley]], [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]] and [[Gregory Corso]] all read there. They were soon joined by [[Richard Caddel]], brought up in [[Kent]] but an honorary Northumbrian, [[Barry MacSweeney]] and [[Colin Simms]]. For some reminiscences of this scene, see the essays by Connie Pickard, [[Tony Baker (poet)|Tony Baker]], and [[Tom Pickard]] in Geraldine Monk (ed.) ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Shearsman, 2012).\n\nThrough Bunting, these younger writers became familiar with the work of the [[Objectivist poets]]. Specifically, [[Louis Zukofsky]] and [[Lorine Niedecker]] were to become important models for Caddel and Simms in their writing about the Northumbrian environment, while John Seed picked up on [[George Oppen]].<ref>John Seed, 'Living the Storm: George Oppen's \"Songs of Experience\"' in John Freeman (ed.) ''Not Comforts / But Vision: Essays on the poetry of George Oppen'' (Interim Press, 1985), 10-25</ref> Pickard and MacSweeney shared Bunting's interest in reviving Northumbrian vowel patterns and verbal music in poetry and all of these poets were influenced by the older poet's insistence on poetry as sounded speech rather than purely written text.\n\nAt [[Easter]], 1967 MacSweeney organised the [[Sparty Lea]] Poetry Festival. This was a ten-day session of reading, writing and discussion. The participants, including the Pickards, MacSweeney, Andrew Crozier, [[John James (poet)|John James]], [[John Temple (poet)|John Temple]], [[Pete Armstrong]], [[Tim Longville]], Peter Riley, [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]], [[J. H. Prynne]] and [[Nick Waite]], stayed in a group of four cottages in the village of Sparty Lea.<ref>Luke Roberts, ''Barry MacSweeney and the Politics of Post-War British Poetry'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2017), 4-6.</ref> This has often been presented as a pivotal event in the British Poetry Revival, bringing together poets who were separated geographically and in terms of poetic influences and encouraging them to support and publish each other's work.\n\nAlthough published by Writers Forum and Pirate Press, [[Geraldine Monk]] is very much a poet of the North of England. Like [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], she writes for performance as much as for the page and there is an undercurrent of feminist concerns in her work. Other poets associated with the North of England included Paul Buck, Glenda George, and John Seed. Paul Buck and Glenda George for many years edited Curtains, a magazine instrumental in disseminating contemporary French poetry and philosophical/theoretical writing. John Seed had picked up on Objectivism while still in the North-East. Geraldine Monk's edited collection of reminiscences by various Northern poets (including [[Jim Burns]], [[Paul Buck]], [[Glenda George]], and [[John Seed]], ''CUSP'', mentioned above, provides a rich account of innovative poetry outside the metropolis.<ref> Geraldine Monk, ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Shearsman, 2012).</ref>\n\n==Cambridge==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}\nThe Cambridge poets were a group centred around [[J. H. Prynne]] and included [[Andrew Crozier]], [[John James (poet)|John James]], [[Douglas Oliver]], [[Veronica Forrest-Thomson]], [[Peter Riley]], Tim Longville and [[John Riley (poet)|John Riley]]. Prynne was influenced by [[Charles Olson]] and Crozier was partly responsible for [[Carl Rakosi]]'s return to poetry in the 1960s. The New York school were also an important influence for many of the Cambridge poets - most obviously in the work of John James. The ''Grosseteste Review'', which published these poets, was originally thought of as a kind of magazine of British Objectivism.\n\nThe Cambridge poets in general wrote in a cooler, more measured style than many of their London or Northumbrian peers (although Barry MacSweeney, for example, felt an affinity with them) and many taught at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] or at [[Anglia Polytechnic University|Anglia Polytechnic]]. There was also less emphasis on performance than there was among the London poets.\n\n==Wales and Scotland==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}\nIn the 60s and early 70s Peter Finch, an associate of Bob Cobbing, ran the No Walls Poetry readings and the ground breaking inclusive magazine, ''second aeon''.  He began Oriel Books in [[Cardiff]] in 1974 and the shop served as a focal point for young [[Welsh literature in English|Welsh]] poets. However, some of the more experimental poets in Wales were not of Welsh origins. Two of the most important expatriate poets operating in Wales were [[John Freeman (poet)|John Freeman]] and [[Chris Torrance]]. Freeman is another British poet influenced by the Objectivists, and he has written on both [[George Oppen]] and Niedecker.In 1985, he edited ''Not Comforts / but Visions'', essays on the poetry of George Oppen, which included work by John Seed, [[Jeremy Hooker]], Freeman, Hampson and others.<ref>John Freeman (ed.), ''Not Comforts  / But Vision: essays on the Poetry of George Oppen'' (Interim Press, 1985).</ref> Torrance has expressed his debt to David Jones. His ongoing ''Magic Door'' sequence is widely regarded as one of the major long poems to come out of the Revival. For some account of this period, see the reminiscences of Chris Torrance and Peter Finch in Geraldine Monk's CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition (Shearsman, 2012).\n\nIn Scotland, Edwin Morgan, Ian Hamilton Finlay and [[Tom Leonard (poet)|Tom Leonard]] emerged as key individual poets during this time, each interested in, among other forms, sound and visual poetry. The viability of a wider, deeper experimental infrastructure in poetry was helped by the gallery, performance space and bookshop at the [[Third Eye Centre]] in Glasgow (later renamed the [[CCA Glasgow|Centre for Contemporary Arts]]). Magazines such as ''Scottish International'', \"Chapman\", and Duncan Glen's magazine ''Akros'' maintained links with the modernist legacy of the inter-war and post-war years while publishing contemporary poets; often, however, by mixing the avant-garde with aesthetically conservative texts.\n\nIn the same vein, in 1972-4 John Schofield, then a post-graduate student, organised three annual poetry festivals in various halls at Edinburgh University, called POEM 72, POEM73 and POEM74. Poets reading their work at the first included Edwin Morgan, Norman MacCaig, Tom Buchan, Robert Garioch and Liz Lochhead. About 700 people attended. For POEM73, the attendance was over 1300 people, hearing Hugh MacDiarmid, George Macbeth, Adrian Mitchell, Jon Silkin and Iain Crichton Smith. The final festival, POEM74, included readings by Adrian Henri, Libby Houston, Jeff Nuttall, Rose McGuire, Frances Horovitz, Ruth Fainlight and Sorley Maclean.\n\n==\"A treacherous assault on British poetry\"==\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Towards Design In Poetry.jpg|thumb|Eric Mottram's ''Towards design in poetry'' (writers forum, 1977)]] -->\n\nIn 1971, a large number of the poets associated with the British Poetry Revival joined the dormant, if not moribund [[Poetry Society]] and in the elections became the Poetry Society's new council. The Society had been traditionally hostile to modernist poetry, but under the new council this position was reversed. Eric Mottram was made editor of the society's magazine ''Poetry Review''. Over the next six years, he edited twenty issues that featured most, if not all, of the key Revival poets and carried reviews of books and magazines from the wide range of small presses that had sprung up to publish them.\n\nNuttall and MacSweeney both served as chairperson of the society during this period and Bob Cobbing used the photocopying facilities in the basement of the society's building to produce Writers Forum books. Around this time, Cobbing, Finch and others established the [[Association of Little Presses]] (ALP) to promote and support small press publishers and organise book fairs at which they could sell their productions.\n\nIn the late 1970s, in response to the number of foreign poets being featured in ''Poetry Review'', Mottram was removed as editor of the magazine; his editorial practices being seen by the Arts Council as \"a treacherous assault on British poetry\", according to Mottram's preface to his section of the anthology, ''the new british poetry''. At the same time, the Arts Council set up an inquiry that overturned the result of the Society's elections that had once more brought in a council dominated by those sympathetic to the Poetry Revival.<ref>For a detailed account of these events, see Peter Barry, The Battle of Earl's Court (Manchester University Press, 2007).</ref>\n\n==The 1980s and after==\n\nA number of younger poets, many of whom who first found an outlet in ''Poetry Review'' under Mottram, began to emerge around the end of the 1970s. In London, [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[Ulli Freer]], [[cris cheek]], [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], [[Robert Sheppard]], and [[Ken Edwards]] were among those who were to the fore. These, and others, met regularly at [[Gilbert Adair]]'s Subvoicive reading series, which also regularly featured poets from North America, as well as visiting poets such as [[Caroline Bergvall]], [[Paul Buck]], [[Andrew Duncan (poet)|Andrew Duncan]], [[D. S. Marriott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]] and [[Denise Riley]]. Edwards ran ''Reality Studios'', a magazine that grew out of [[Alembic (UK poetry magazine)]], the magazine he had co-edited through the 1970s with Peter Barry and Robert Hampson. Through Reality Studios, he helped introduce the [[Language poets|L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets]] to a British readership. He also ran Reality Street Editions with Cambridge-based [[Wendy Mulford]], which continued to be a major publisher of contemporary poetry until 2018 and an important bridge between US and UK poetries. The London-based [[Angel Exhaust]] magazine brought many of the younger poets together - in particular, Adrian Clarke, [[Robert Sheppard]] and [[Andrew_Duncan_(poet)|Andrew Duncan]]. In the Midlands, Tony Baker's ''Figs'' magazine focused more on the Objectivist and Bunting-inspired poetry of the Northumbrian school while introducing a number of new poets.\n\nIn 1988 an anthology called ''[[The New British Poetry]]'' was published. It featured a section on the Revival poets edited by Mottram and another on the younger poets edited by Edwards. In 1987, Crozier and Longville published their anthology ''A Various Art'', which focused mainly on the Cambridge poets, and Iain Sinclair edited yet another anthology of Revival-related work ''[[Conductors of Chaos]]'' (1996). For an account of some of the work produced by these poets, see Robert Hampson and Peter Barry (eds.), ''The New British poetries: the scope of the possible'' (Manchester University Press, 1993). In 1994 [[W. N. Herbert]] and [[Richard Price]] co-edited the anthology of Scottish [[Informationist poetry]] ''Contraflow on the SuperHighway'' (Gairfish and Southfields Press).\n\nThe anthology ''[[Conductors of Chaos]]'' featured another aspect of the Revival; the recovery of neglected British modernists of the generation after Bunting. Poets [[David Gascoyne]], selected by Jeremy Reed; [[W. S. Graham]], selected by Tony Lopez; [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]], selected by [[Drew Milne]]; [[J.F. Hendry]], selected by Andrew Crozier and [[Nicholas Moore]], selected by Peter Riley were reappraised and returned to their rightful place in the history of 20th century British poetry. Another interesting development was the establishment of the British and Irish poetry discussion list by Richard Caddel. This continues to provide an international forum for discussion and the exchange of news on experimental British and Irish poetry. Much wider publication for Revival poetry was arranged via the USA. Caddel, together with Peter Middleton, edited a selection of new UK poetry for US readers in a special issue of ''Talisman'' (1996).<ref>''Talisman: a Journal of Contemporary Poetry and Poetics'' 16 (1996): 110-173.</ref> With [[Peter Quartermain]] Caddel also edited ''[[Other: British and Irish Poetry since 1970]]'' (USA, 1999); while Keith Tuma's ''[[Anthology of Twentieth-Century British and Irish Poetry]]'' (Oxford University Press, USA, 2001) incorporates this poetry into a wider retrospective of the whole century.\n\nInto the 1990s and beyond poets such as [[Johan de Wit (poet)]], [[Sean Bonney]], [[Jeff Hilson]], and [[Piers Hugill]] have surfaced after direct involvement in the Cobbing-led [[Writers Forum]] workshop.  An interesting sub-development of the workshop was the instigation of the Foro De Escritores workshop, in Santiago Chile, run on similar aesthetic principles.

{"title_page": "History of the Netherlands", "text_new": "{{short description|Dutch history}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2020}}\n{{History of the Netherlands}}\n\nThe '''History of the Netherlands''' is a history of seafaring people thriving on a lowland [[river delta]] on the [[North Sea]] in northwestern Europe. Records begin with the four centuries during which the region formed a militarized border zone of the [[Romans in the Netherlands|Roman]] Empire. This came under increasing pressure from [[Germanic peoples]] moving westwards. As Roman power collapsed and the [[Middle Ages]] began, three dominant [[Germanic peoples]] coalesced in the area, [[Frisians]] in the north and coastal areas, [[Dutch Low Saxon|Low Saxons]] in the northeast, and the [[Franks]] in the south.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the descendants of the [[Carolingian]] dynasty came to dominate the area and then extended their rule to a large part of Western Europe. The region of the [[Netherlands]] therefore became part of [[Lower Lotharingia]] within the Frankish [[Holy Roman Empire]]. For several centuries, lordships such as [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], [[County of Holland|Holland]], [[Zeeland]], [[Friesland]], [[Guelders]] and others held a changing patchwork of territories. There was no unified equivalent of the modern Netherlands.\n\nBy 1433, the [[Philip the Good|Duke of Burgundy]] had assumed control over most of the lowlands territories in Lower Lotharingia; he created the [[Burgundian Netherlands]] which included modern Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and a part of France.\n\nThe Catholic kings of Spain took strong measures against Protestantism, which polarised the peoples of present-day Belgium and the Netherlands. The subsequent [[Dutch revolt]] led to splitting the Burgundian Netherlands into a Catholic French and Dutch-speaking \"[[Spanish Netherlands]]\" (approximately corresponding to modern Belgium and Luxembourg), and a northern \"[[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]]\", which spoke Dutch and were predominantly Protestant with a Catholic minority. It became the modern Netherlands.\n\nIn the [[Dutch Golden Age]], which had its zenith around 1667, there was a flowering of trade, industry, the arts and the [[List of people from the Dutch Golden Age#Science|sciences]]. A rich worldwide [[Dutch empire]] developed and the [[Dutch East India Company]] became one of the earliest and most important of national mercantile companies based on entrepreneurship and trade.\n\nDuring the eighteenth century, the power, wealth and influence of the Netherlands declined. A series of wars with the more powerful [[Anglo-Dutch Wars|British]] and [[Franco-Dutch War|French]] neighbours weakened it. The UK seized the North American colony of [[New Amsterdam]], and renamed it \"New York\". There was growing unrest and [[Second Stadtholderless Period#Crisis and the Orangist revolution of 1747|conflict]] between the [[Orangism (Netherlands)|Orangists]] and the [[Patriottentijd|Patriots]]. The French Revolution spilled over after 1789, and a pro-French [[Batavian Republic]] was established in 1795\u20131806. Napoleon made it a satellite state, the [[Kingdom of Holland]] (1806\u20131810), and later simply a French imperial province.\n\nAfter the collapse of Napoleon in 1813\u201315, an expanded \"[[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]]\" was created with the [[House of Orange-Nassau|House of Orange]] as monarchs, also ruling Belgium and Luxembourg. The King imposed unpopular Protestant reforms on Belgium, [[Belgian Revolution|which revolted in 1830]] and became independent in 1839. After an initially conservative period, following the introduction of the 1848 constitution; the country became a [[parliamentary democracy]] with a [[constitutional monarch]]. Modern-day Luxembourg became officially independent from the Netherlands in 1839, but a personal union remained until 1890. Since 1890, it is ruled by another branch of the House of Nassau.\n\nThe Netherlands was neutral during the [[First World War]], but during the [[Second World War]], it was invaded and occupied by [[Nazi Germany]]. The Nazis, including many collaborators, rounded up and killed almost all of the country's Jewish population. When the Dutch resistance increased, the Nazis cut off food supplies to much of the country, causing severe starvation in 1944\u201345. In 1942, the Dutch East Indies were conquered by Japan, but prior to this the Dutch destroyed the oil wells for which Japan was desperate. [[Indonesia]] proclaimed its independence from the Netherlands in 1945, followed by [[Suriname]] in 1975. The post-war years saw rapid economic recovery (helped by the American [[Marshall Plan]]), followed by the introduction of a [[welfare state]] during an era of peace and prosperity. The Netherlands formed a new economic alliance with Belgium and Luxembourg, the [[Benelux]], and all three became founding members of the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]]. In recent decades, the Dutch economy has been closely linked to that of Germany and is highly prosperous.

In this period of Dutch prehistory, the first notable remains were erected: the [[dolmens]], large stone grave monuments. They are found in [[Drenthe]], and were probably built between 4100 BC and 3200 BC.\n\nTo the west, the [[Vlaardingen culture]] (around 2600 BC), an apparently more primitive culture of hunter-gatherers survived well into the [[Neolithic]] period.\n\n===Corded Ware and Bell Beaker cultures (around 3000\u20132000 BC)===\nAround 2950 BCE there was a transition from the [[Funnelbeaker]] farming culture to the [[Corded Ware]] pastoralist culture, a large archeological horizon appearing in western and central Europe, that is associated with the advance of Indo-European languages.

This culture also experimented with working with copper. Evidence of this, including stone anvils, copper knives, and a copper spearhead, was found on the [[Veluwe]]. Copper finds show that there was trade with other areas in Europe, as natural copper is not found in Dutch soil.\n\n===Bronze Age (around 2000\u2013800 BC)===\n[[File:Zwaard van Jutphaas.jpg|thumb|right|80px|A bronze ceremonial object (not a sword, but called the \"Sword of Jutphaas\"), dating from 1800 to 1500 BC and found south of [[Utrecht]].]]\n\nThe [[Bronze Age]] probably started somewhere around 2000 BC and lasted until around 800 BC. The earliest [[bronze]] tools have been found in the grave of a Bronze Age individual called \"the smith of [[Wageningen]]\". More Bronze Age objects from later periods have been found in [[Epe, Netherlands|Epe]], [[Drouwen]] and elsewhere. Broken bronze objects found in [[Voorschoten]] were apparently destined for recycling. This indicates how valuable bronze was considered in the Bronze Age. Typical bronze objects from this period included knives, swords, axes, [[fibulae]] and bracelets.\n\n[[File:BronzAgeElp.png|thumb|left|Location of the [[Elp culture|Elp]] and [[Hilversum culture]]s in the Bronze Age.]]\nMost of the Bronze Age objects found in the Netherlands have been found in [[Drenthe]]. One item shows that trading networks during this period extended a far distance. Large bronze ''situlae'' (buckets) found in Drenthe were manufactured somewhere in eastern France or in [[Switzerland]]. They were used for mixing wine with water (a Roman/Greek custom). The many finds in Drenthe of rare and valuable objects, such as tin-bead necklaces, suggest that Drenthe was a trading centre in the Netherlands in the Bronze Age.\n\nThe [[Beaker culture|Bell Beaker cultures]] (2700\u20132100) locally developed into the Bronze Age Barbed-Wire Beaker culture (2100\u20131800). In the second millennium BC, the region was the boundary between the [[Atlantic Bronze Age|Atlantic]] and [[Nordic Bronze Age|Nordic]] horizons and was split into a northern and a southern region, roughly divided by the course of the [[Rhine]].\n\nIn the north, the [[Elp culture]] (c. 1800 to 800 BC)<ref>According to \"Het Archeologisch Basisregister\" (ABR), version 1.0 November 1992, [http://www.racm.nl/content/documenten%5Cabr%20website.pdf], ''Elp K\u00fcmmerkeramik'' is dated BRONSMA (early MBA) to BRONSL (LBA) and this has been standardized by \"De Rijksdienst voor Archeologie, Cultuurlandschap en Monumenten\" (RACM) as being at the period starting at 1800 BC and ending at 800 BC.{{Failed verification|date=October 2011}} {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> was a Bronze Age archaeological culture having [[earthenware]] pottery of low quality known as \"''K\u00fcmmerkeramik''\" (or \"''Grobkeramik''\") as a marker. The initial phase was characterized by [[tumulus|tumuli]] (1800\u20131200 BC) that were strongly tied to contemporary tumuli in northern Germany and Scandinavia, and were apparently related to the [[Tumulus culture]] (1600\u20131200 BC) in central Europe. This phase was followed by a subsequent change featuring [[Urnfield]] ([[cremation]]) burial customs (1200\u2013800 BC). The southern region became dominated by the [[Hilversum culture]] (1800\u2013800), which apparently inherited the cultural ties with Britain of the previous Barbed-Wire Beaker culture.\n\n== The pre-Roman period (800 BC \u2013 58 BC) ==\n\n===Iron Age===\n[[File:Boerderij IJzertijd Reijntjesveld.jpg|thumb|A reconstruction of an [[Iron Age]] dwelling on the Reijntjesveld near [[Orvelte]] in [[Drenthe]].]]\n[[File:Verbogen Keltische zwaard.jpg|thumb|The original curved iron sword from the [[Vorstengraf (Oss)]], [[Rijksmuseum van Oudheden]].]]\n\nThe [[Iron Age]] brought a measure of prosperity to the people living in the area of the present-day Netherlands. Iron ore was available throughout the country, including [[bog iron]] extracted from the [[ore]] in [[peat bogs]] (''moeras ijzererts'') in the north, the natural iron-bearing balls found in the [[Veluwe]] and the red iron ore near the rivers in Brabant. [[Blacksmith|Smiths]] travelled from small settlement to settlement with [[bronze]] and iron, fabricating tools on demand, including axes, knives, pins, arrowheads and swords. Some evidence even suggests the making of [[Damascus steel]] swords using an advanced method of [[forging]] that combined the flexibility of iron with the strength of steel.\n\nIn [[Oss]], a grave dating from around 500 BC was found in a burial mound 52 metres wide (and thus the largest of its kind in western Europe). Dubbed the \"king's grave\" (''[[Vorstengraf (Oss)]]''), it contained extraordinary objects, including an iron sword with an inlay of gold and coral.\n\nIn the centuries just before the arrival of the Romans, northern areas formerly occupied by the Elp culture emerged as the probably Germanic Harpstedt culture<ref name=Mallory>Mallory, J.P., ''In Search of the Indo-Europeans: Language, Archaeology and Myth'', London: Thames & Hudson, 1989, p. 87.</ref> while the southern parts were influenced by the [[Hallstatt culture]] and assimilated into the Celtic [[La T\u00e8ne culture]].

One of the most important is Caesar's own ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]''. Two main tribes he described as living in what is now the Netherlands were the [[Menapii]], and the [[Eburones]], both in the south, which is where Caesar was active. He established the principle that the Rhine defined a natural boundary between [[Gaul]] and [[Germania magna]]. But the Rhine was not a strong border, and he made it clear that there was a part of Belgic Gaul where many of the local tribes (including the Eburones) were \"[[Germani cisrhenani]]\", or in other cases, of mixed origin.\n\nThe Menapii stretched from the south of Zeeland, through [[North Brabant]] (and possibly [[South Holland]]), into the southeast of [[Gelderland]]. In later Roman times their territory seems to have been divided or reduced, so that it became mainly contained in what is now western Belgium.\n\nThe [[Eburones]], the largest of the ''Germani Cisrhenani'' group, covered a large area including at least part of modern [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Dutch Limburg]], stretching east to the [[Rhine]] in Germany, and also northwest to the delta, giving them a border with the Menapii. Their territory may have stretched into Gelderland.\n\nIn the delta itself, Caesar makes a passing comment about the ''Insula Batavorum'' (\"Island of the Batavi\") in the [[Rhine river]], without discussing who lived there. Later, in imperial times, a tribe called the Batavi became very important in this region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0001:book=4:chapter=10&highlight=batavi|title=C.

After a series of military actions, the Rhine became fixed around 12 AD as Rome's northern frontier on the European mainland. A number of towns and developments would arise along this line. The area to the south would be integrated into the [[Roman Empire]]. At first part of [[Gallia Belgica]], this area became part of the [[Roman province|province]] of [[Germania Inferior]]. The tribes already within, or relocated to, this area became part of the [[Roman Empire]]. The area to the north of the Rhine, inhabited by the [[Frisii]] and the [[Chauci]], remained outside Roman rule but not its presence and control.\n\nRomans built military forts along the [[Limes Germanicus]] and a number of towns and smaller settlements in the Netherlands. The more notable Roman towns were at [[Nijmegen]] ([[:nl:Ulpia Noviomagus Batavorum|Ulpia Noviomagus Batavorum]]) and at [[Voorburg]] ([[Forum Hadriani]]).\n\nPerhaps the most evocative Roman ruin is the mysterious [[Brittenburg]], which emerged from the sand at the beach in Katwijk several centuries ago, only to be buried again. These ruins were part of [[:nl:Lugdunum Batavorum|Lugdunum Batavorum]].\n\nOther Roman settlements, fortifications, temples and other structures have been found at [[Alphen aan de Rijn]] ([[Albaniana (Roman fort)|Albaniana]]); [[Bodegraven]]; [[Cuijk]]; [[Elst, Overbetuwe]]; [[Ermelo]]; [[Esch, Netherlands|Esch]]; [[Heerlen]]; [[Houten]]; [[Kessel, North Brabant]]; [[Oss]], i.e. De Lithse Ham near Maren-Kessel; Kesteren in [[Neder-Betuwe]]; [[Leiden]] ([[Matilo]]); [[Maastricht]]; Meinerswijk (now part of [[Arnhem]]); [[Tiel]]; [[Utrecht]] ([[Traiectum (Utrecht)|Traiectum]]); [[Valkenburg (South Holland)]] ([[Praetorium Agrippinae]]); Vechten ([[Fectio]]) now part of [[Bunnik]]; [[Velsen]]; [[Vleuten]]; [[Wijk bij Duurstede]] ([[:nl:Levefanum|Levefanum]]); [[Woerden]] ([[:nl:Laurium (Woerden)|Laurium]] or [[:nl:Laurium (Woerden)|Laurum]]); and [[Zwammerdam]] ([[:nl:Nigrum Pullum|Nigrum Pullum]]).\n\n===Batavian revolt===\n{{Main|Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Revolt of the Batavi}}\n[[File:\"Batavians defeating Romans on the Rhine\" by Otto van Veen.jpg|thumb|Throughout Dutch history, but especially during the [[Eighty Years' War]], the Batavians have been romantically portrayed as the heroic ancestors of the Dutch people. \"The Batavians Defeating the Romans on the Rhine\", c. 1613, by [[Otto van Veen]].]]\n[[File:Bataafseeed.jpg|thumb|''The Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis'', 1661, by [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]], depicts a [[Batavii|Batavian]] oath to [[Gaius Julius Civilis]], the head of the [[Batavian rebellion]] against the [[ancient Rome|Romans]] in 69 CE.]]\n\nThe [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavians]], Cananefates, and the other border tribes were held in high regard as soldiers throughout the empire, and traditionally served in the [[Ala (Roman military)|Roman cavalry]].<ref>Roymans, Nico, ''Ethnic Identity and Imperial Power: The Batavians in the Early Roman Empire'', Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press, 2005, pp. 226\u201327</ref> The frontier culture was influenced by the Romans, [[Germanic people]], and Gauls. In the first centuries after Rome's conquest of Gaul, trade flourished. And Roman, Gaulish and Germanic material culture are found combined in the region.\n\nHowever, the Batavians rose against the Romans in the [[Batavian rebellion]] of 69 AD. The leader of this [[Revolt of the Batavi|revolt]] was Batavian [[Gaius Julius Civilis]]. One of the causes of the rebellion was that the Romans had taken young Batavians as [[Slavery|slaves]]. A number of Roman ''castella'' were attacked and burnt. Other Roman soldiers in [[Xanten]] and elsewhere and auxiliary troops of Batavians and [[Canninefates|Canninefatae]] in the legions of [[Vitellius]]) joined the revolt, thus splitting the northern part of the Roman army. In April 70 AD, a few legions sent by [[Vespasianus]] and commanded by [[Quintus Petillius Cerialis]] eventually defeated the Batavians and negotiated surrender with [[Gaius Julius Civilis]] somewhere between the [[Waal (river)|Waal]] and the [[Meuse River|Maas]] near Noviomagus ([[Nijmegen]]), which was probably called \"Batavodurum\" by the Batavians.<ref>[http://classics.mit.edu/Tacitus/histories.html ''Historiae''], Tacitus, 109 AD, Translated by Alfred John Church and William Jackson Brodribb.</ref> The Batavians later merged with other tribes and became part of the [[Salian Franks]].\n\nDutch writers in the 17th and 18th centuries saw the rebellion of the independent and freedom-loving Batavians as mirroring the Dutch revolt against Spain and other forms of tyranny. According to this nationalist view, the [[Batavians]] were the \"true\" forefathers of the Dutch, which explains the recurring use of the name over the centuries. [[Jakarta]] was named \"Batavia\" by the Dutch in 1619. The Dutch republic created in 1795 on the basis of French revolutionary principles was called the [[Batavian Republic]].

He continued his conquests into [[Gaul]].\n\nAfter the death of [[Clovis I]] in 511, his four sons partitioned his kingdom amongst themselves, with [[Theuderic I of Austrasia|Theuderic I]] receiving the lands that were to become Austrasia (including the southern Netherlands). A line of kings descended from Theuderic ruled [[Austrasia]] until 555, when it was united with the other Frankish kingdoms of [[Chlothar I]], who inherited all the Frankish realms by 558. He redivided the Frankish territory amongst his four sons, but the four kingdoms coalesced into three on the death of [[Charibert I]] in 567.

Some went further by ascribing certain attributes, values and strengths to these various groups and proposing that they reflected 19th-century nationalist and religious views. In particular, it was believed that this theory explained why Belgium and the southern Netherlands (i.e. the Franks) had become Catholic and the northern Netherlands (Frisians and Saxons) had become Protestant. The success of this theory was partly due to anthropological theories based on a tribal paradigm. Being politically and geographically inclusive, and yet accounting for diversity, this theory was in accordance with the need for nation-building and integration during the 1890\u20131914 period. The theory was taught in Dutch schools.\n\nHowever, the disadvantages of this historical interpretation became apparent. This tribal-based theory suggested that external borders were weak or non-existent and that there were clear-cut internal borders. This origins myth provided an historical premise, especially during the Second World War, for regional separatism and annexation to Germany. After 1945 the tribal paradigm lost its appeal for anthropological scholars and historians. When the accuracy of the three-tribe theme was fundamentally questioned, the theory fell out of favour.<ref name=\"Marnix Beyen 1850\"/>\n\nDue to the scarcity of written sources, knowledge of this period depends to a large degree on the interpretation of archaeological data. The traditional view of a clear-cut division between [[Frisians]] in the north and coast, [[Franks]] in the south and [[Saxons]] in the east has proven historically problematic.<ref>Blok, D.P.

(2003), pp. 30\u201333</ref>\n\n===The emergence of the Dutch language===\n{{Main|Old Dutch|Old Frisian|Dutch Low Saxon}}\nThe language from which [[Old Dutch]] (also sometimes called [[Old West Low Franconian]], [[Old Low Franconian]] or [[Old Frankish]]) arose is not known with certainty, but it is thought to be the language spoken by the [[Salian Franks]]. Even though the Franks are traditionally categorized as [[Weser-Rhine Germanic]], Dutch has a number of [[Ingvaeonic]] characteristics and is classified by modern linguists as an [[Ingvaeonic]] language. Dutch also has a number of [[Old Saxon]] characteristics. There was a close relationship between [[Old Dutch]], [[Old Saxon]], [[Old English]] and [[Old Frisian]]. Because texts written in the language spoken by the Franks are almost non-existent, and [[Old Dutch]] texts scarce and fragmentary, not much is known about the development of [[Old Dutch]]. [[Old Dutch]] made the transition to [[Middle Dutch]] around 1150.<ref name=\"Verhaal\"/>\n\n===Christianization===\nThe Christianity that arrived in the Netherlands with the Romans appears not to have died out completely (in [[Maastricht]], at least) after the withdrawal of the Romans in about 411.<ref name=\"Milis, L.J.R. pp. 6-18\"/>\n\nThe [[Franks]] became Christians after their king [[Clovis I]] converted to Catholicism, an event which is traditionally set in 496. Christianity was introduced in the north after the conquest of [[Friesland]] by the [[Franks]]. The [[Saxons]] in the east were converted before the conquest of [[Saxony]], and became Frankish allies.\n\n[[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Hiberno-Scottish]] and [[Anglo-Saxon mission|Anglo-Saxon]] missionaries, particularly [[Willibrord]], [[Wulfram of Sens|Wulfram]] and [[Boniface]], played an important role in converting the Frankish and Frisian peoples to Christianity by the 8th century. Boniface was martyred by the [[Frisians]] in [[Dokkum]] (754).\n\n===Frankish dominance and incorporation into the Holy Roman Empire===\n{{Main|Frisian-Frankish Wars}}\n[[File:Radboud doopvont.jpg|thumb|left|An early 16th-century tapestry depicting the near baptism of [[Redbad, King of the Frisians]], who died in 719 CE.]]\n\nIn the early 8th century the Frisians came increasingly into conflict with the [[Franks]] to the south, resulting in a [[Frisian\u2013Frankish wars|series of wars]] in which the [[Frankish Empire]] eventually subjugated Frisia. In 734, at the [[Battle of the Boarn]], the Frisians in the Netherlands were defeated by the [[Franks]], who thereby conquered the area west of the [[Lauwers]]. The Franks then conquered the area east of the Lauwers in 785 when [[Charlemagne]] defeated [[Widukind]].\n\nThe linguistic descendants of the Franks, the modern [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Dutch language|-speakers]] of the [[Netherlands]] and [[Flanders]], seem to have broken with the [[Exonym and endonym|endonym]] \"Frank\" around the 9th century. By this time Frankish identity had changed from an ethnic identity to a national identity, becoming localized and confined to the modern ''[[Franconia]]'' and principally to the French province of ''[[\u00cele-de-France]]''.<ref>van der Wal, M., ''Geschiedenis van het Nederlands'', 1992 {{Full citation needed|date=November 2012}}, p. {{Page needed|date=October 2011}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the people no longer referred to themselves as \"Franks\", the Netherlands was still part of the [[Frankish empire]] of [[Charlemagne]]. Indeed, because of the Austrasian origins of the Carolingians in the area between the Rhine and the Maas, the cities of Aachen, Maastricht, Li\u00e8ge and Nijmegen were at the heart of Carolingian culture.<ref name=\"Milis, L.J.R. pp. 6-18\"/> Charlemagne maintained his ''palatium''<ref>{{cite web|title=Charlemagne: Court and administration|encyclopedia= [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/106546/Charlemagne/256621/Court-and-administration}} (\"Charlemagne relied on his palatium, a shifting assemblage of family members, trusted lay and ecclesiastical companions, and assorted hangers-on, which constituted an itinerant court following the king as he carried out his military campaigns and sought to take advantage of the income from widely scattered royal estates.\")</ref> in [[Nijmegen]] at least four times.\n\nThe [[Carolingian empire]] would eventually include France, Germany, northern Italy and much of Western Europe. In 843, the Frankish empire was divided into three parts, giving rise to [[West Francia]] in the west, [[East Francia]] in the east, and [[Middle Francia]] in the centre. Most of what is today the Netherlands became part of [[Middle Francia]]; Flanders became part of [[West Francia]]. This division was an important factor in the historical distinction between Flanders and the other Dutch-speaking areas.\n\n[[Middle Francia]] ({{lang-la|Francia media}}) was an ephemeral [[Francia|Frankish]] kingdom that had no historical or ethnic identity to bind its varied peoples. It was created by the [[Treaty of Verdun]] in 843, which divided the [[Carolingian Empire]] among the sons of [[Louis the Pious]]. Situated between the realms of [[East Francia|East]] and [[West Francia]], Middle Francia comprised the Frankish territory between the rivers [[Rhine]] and [[Scheldt]], the [[Frisia]]n coast of the [[North Sea]], the former [[Kingdom of Burgundy]] (except for a western portion, later known as [[Duchy of Burgundy|''Bourgogne'']]), [[Provence]] and the [[Kingdom of Italy (medieval)|Kingdom of Italy]].\n\nMiddle Francia fell to [[Lothair I]], the eldest son and successor of [[Louis the Pious]], after an intermittent civil war with his younger brothers [[Louis the German]] and [[Charles the Bald]]. In acknowledgement of Lothair's [[Holy Roman Emperor|Imperial]] title, Middle Francia contained the imperial cities of [[Aachen]], the residence of [[Charlemagne]], as well as Rome. In 855, on his deathbed at [[Pr\u00fcm Abbey]], Emperor Lothair I again partitioned his realm amongst his sons. Most of the lands north of the [[Alps]], including the Netherlands, passed to [[Lothair II of Lotharingia|Lothair II]] and consecutively were named [[Lotharingia]]. After Lothair II died in 869, Lotharingia was partitioned by his uncles Louis the German and Charles the Bald in the [[Treaty of Meerssen]] in 870. Although some of the Netherlands had come under Viking control, in 870 it technically became part of [[East Francia]], which became the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 962.\n\n===Viking raids===\n[[File:Rorik by H. W. Koekkoek.jpg|thumb|[[Rorik of Dorestad]], [[Viking]] conqueror and ruler of [[Friesland]], a romantic 1912 depiction by [[Johannes Hermanus Koekkoek|Johannes H. Koekkoek]].]]\nIn the 9th and 10th centuries, the Vikings raided the largely defenceless [[Frisians|Frisian]] and [[Franks|Frankish]] towns lying on the coast and along the rivers of the [[Low Countries]]. Although Vikings never settled in large numbers in those areas, they did set up long-term bases and were even acknowledged as lords in a few cases. In Dutch and Frisian historical tradition, the trading centre of [[Dorestad]] declined after Viking raids from 834 to 863; however, since no convincing Viking archaeological evidence has been found at the site (as of 2007), doubts about this have grown in recent years.<ref>More info about Viking raids can be found online at L. van der Tuuk, [http://home.tiscali.nl/gjallar/index.html Gjallar. Noormannen in de Lage Landen]</ref>\n\nOne of the most important Viking families in the Low Countries was that of [[Rorik of Dorestad]] (based in [[Wieringen]]) and his brother the \"younger Harald\" (based in [[Walcheren]]), both thought to be nephews of [[Harald Klak]].<ref>Baldwin, Stephen, [http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/GEN-MEDIEVAL/2002-09/1031544685 \"Danish Haralds in 9th Century Frisia\"]. Retrieved 9 October 2011.</ref> Around 850, [[Lothair I]] acknowledged Rorik as ruler of most of Friesland. And again in 870, Rorik was received by [[Charles the Bald]] in [[Nijmegen]], to whom he became a vassal. Viking raids continued during that period. Harald's son Rodulf and his men were killed by the people of [[Oostergo]] in 873. Rorik died sometime before 882.\n\nBuried Viking treasures consisting mainly of silver have been found in the Low Countries. Two such treasures have been found in Wieringen. A large treasure found in Wieringen in 1996 dates from around 850 and is thought perhaps to have been connected to Rorik. The burial of such a valuable treasure is seen as an indication that there was a permanent settlement in Wieringen.<ref>\"[http://www.museumkennis.nl/lp.rmo/museumkennis/i000412.html Vikingschat van Wieringen\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718064223/http://www.museumkennis.nl/lp.rmo/museumkennis/i000412.html |date=18 July 2011 }}, Museumkennis.nl.

Using [[Ghent]] as his base, they ravaged Ghent, [[Maastricht]], [[Li\u00e8ge]], [[Stavelot]], [[Pr\u00fcm]], [[Cologne]], and [[Koblenz]]. Controlling most of Frisia between 882 and his death in 885, Godfrid became known to history as [[Godfrid, Duke of Frisia]]. His lordship over Frisia was acknowledged by [[Charles the Fat]], to whom he became a vassal. Godfried was assassinated in 885, after which [[Gerolf of Holland]] assumed lordship and Viking rule of Frisia came to an end.\n\nViking raids of the Low Countries continued for over a century. Remains of Viking attacks dating from 880 to 890 have been found in [[Zutphen]] and [[Deventer]]. In 920, King [[Henry I of Germany|Henry]] of Germany liberated [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]. According to a number of chronicles, the last attacks took place in the first decade of the 11th century and were directed at [[Tiel]] and/or [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]].<ref>Jesch, Judith, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=RkNY2KrdvscC&pg=PA82 Ships and Men in the Late Viking Age: The Vocabulary of Runic Inscriptions and Skaldic Verse]'', Boydell & Brewer, 2001. {{ISBN|978-0-85115-826-6}}. p. 82.</ref>\n\nThese Viking raids occurred about the same time that French and German lords were fighting for supremacy over the middle empire that included the Netherlands, so their sway over this area was weak. Resistance to the Vikings, if any, came from local nobles, who gained in stature as a result.\n\n==High and Late Middle Ages (1000\u20131432)==\n\n===Part of the Holy Roman Empire===\nThe German kings and emperors ruled the Netherlands in the 10th and 11th century. Germany was called the Holy Roman Empire after the coronation of [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|King Otto the Great]] as emperor. The Dutch city of [[Nijmegen]] used to be the spot of an important domain of the German emperors. Several German emperors were born and died there, including for example [[Byzantine]] empress [[Theophanu]], who died in Nijmegen. Utrecht was also an important city and trading port at the time.\n\n===Political disunity===\n[[File:Valkhofkapel.JPG|thumb|Chapel of St Nicholas ({{Interlanguage link multi|Sint-Nicolaaskapel|nl}} or Valkhofkapel) in [[Nijmegen]], one of the oldest buildings in the Netherlands.]]\n\nThe Holy Roman Empire was not able to maintain political unity. In addition to the growing independence of the towns, local rulers turned their counties and duchies into private kingdoms and felt little sense of obligation to the emperor who reigned over large parts of the nation in name only. Large parts of what now comprise the Netherlands were governed by the Count of Holland, the Duke of [[Gelre]], the Duke of Brabant and the Bishop of Utrecht. [[Friesland]] and [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] in the north maintained their independence and were governed by the lower nobility.\n\nThe various feudal states were in a state of almost continual war. [[Gelre]] and Holland fought for control of [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]]. Utrecht, whose bishop had in 1000 ruled over half of what is today the Netherlands, was marginalised as it experienced continuing difficulty in electing new bishops. At the same time, the dynasties of neighbouring states were more stable. [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], [[Drenthe]] and most of Gelre, which used to be part of Utrecht, became independent. Brabant tried to conquer its neighbours, but was not successful.  Holland also tried to assert itself in Zeeland and Friesland, but its attempts failed.\n\n===The Frisians===\nThe language and culture of most of the people who lived in the area that is now Holland were originally [[Frisia]]n. The sparsely populated area was known as \"West Friesland\" (''Westfriesland''). As Frankish settlement progressed, the Frisians migrated away or were absorbed and the area quickly became [[Old Dutch|Dutch]].  (The part of North Holland situated north of [[Alkmaar]] is still colloquially known as West Friesland).\n\nThe rest of [[Friesland]] in the north continued to maintain its independence during this time. It had its own institutions (collectively called the \"[[Frisian freedom]]\") and resented the imposition of the feudal system and the patriciate found in other European towns. They regarded themselves as allies of Switzerland. The Frisian battle cry was \"better dead than a slave\". They later lost their independence when they were defeated in 1498 by the German [[Landsknecht]] mercenaries of [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Duke Albrecht of Saxony-Meissen]].\n\n===The rise of Holland===\n[[File:Rochussen Egmond.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dirk VI, Count of Holland]], 1114\u20131157, and his mother Petronella visiting the work on the [[Egmond Abbey]], Charles Rochussen, 1881.

Originally granted as a fief to the Danish chieftain [[Rorik of Dorestad|Rorik]] in return for loyalty to the emperor in 862, the region of [[Kennemerland|Kennemara]] (the region around modern [[Haarlem]]) rapidly grew under Rorik's descendants in size and importance. By the early 11th century, [[Dirk III, Count of Holland]] was levying tolls on the Meuse estuary and was able to resist military intervention from his overlord, the Duke of Lower Lorraine.\n\nIn 1083, the name \"Holland\" first appears in a deed referring to a region corresponding more or less to the current province of South Holland and the southern half of what is now North Holland. Holland's influence continued to grow over the next two centuries. The [[counts of Holland]] conquered most of [[Zeeland]] but it was not until 1289 that Count [[Floris V]] was able to subjugate the Frisians in West Friesland (that is, the northern half of North Holland).\n\n===Expansion and growth===\n{{Main|History of urban centers in the Dutch Low Countries}}\n\nAround 1000 AD there were several agricultural developments (described sometimes as an agricultural revolution) that resulted in an increase in production, especially food production. The economy started to develop at a fast pace, and the higher productivity allowed workers to farm more land or to become tradesmen.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nMuch of the western Netherlands was barely inhabited between the end of the Roman period until around 1100 AD, when farmers from [[Flanders]] and [[Utrecht]] began purchasing the swampy land, draining it and cultivating it. This process happened quickly and the uninhabited territory was settled in a few generations. They built independent farms that were not part of villages, something unique in Europe at the time.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n[[Guilds]] were established and markets developed as production exceeded local needs. Also, the introduction of currency made trading a much easier affair than it had been before. Existing towns grew and new towns sprang into existence around [[monasteries]] and [[castles]], and a mercantile middle class began to develop in these urban areas. Commerce and town development increased as the population grew.\n\nThe [[Crusade]]s were popular in the Low Countries and drew many to fight in the [[Holy Land]]. At home, there was relative peace. Viking pillaging had stopped. Both the Crusades and the relative peace at home contributed to trade and the growth in commerce.\n\nCities arose and flourished, especially in [[Flanders]] and [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]]. As the cities grew in wealth and power, they started to buy certain privileges for themselves from the [[monarch|sovereign]], including [[City rights in the Low Countries|city rights]], the right to self-government and the right to pass laws. In practice, this meant that the wealthiest cities became quasi-independent republics in their own right. Two of the most important cities were [[Brugge]] and [[Antwerp]] (in [[Flanders]]) which would later develop into some of the most important cities and ports in Europe.\n\n===Hook and Cod Wars===\n{{Main|Hook and Cod wars}}\n[[File:Jacoba van Beieren (1401-1436), gravin van Holland en Zeeland.jpg|thumb|[[Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut]], 1401\u20131436, known to the Dutch as \"Jacoba of Bavaria\".]]\nThe [[Hook and Cod Wars]] ({{lang-nl|Hoekse en Kabeljauwse twisten}}) were a series of wars and battles in the [[County of Holland]] between 1350 and 1490. Most of these wars were fought over the title of [[count of Holland]], but some have argued that the underlying reason was because of the power struggle of the [[bourgeois]] in the cities against the ruling nobility.\n\nThe Cod faction generally consisted of the more progressive cities of [[Holland]].  The Hook faction consisted for a large part of the conservative noblemen. Some of the main figures in this multi-generational conflict were [[William IV, Count of Holland|William IV]], [[Margaret II, Countess of Hainaut|Margaret]], [[William V, Count of Hainaut|William V]], [[William VI, Count of Holland]] and Hainaut, [[John, Duke of Bavaria-Straubing|John]] and [[Philip III, Duke of Burgundy|Philip the Good]], [[Duke of Burgundy]]. But perhaps the most well known is [[Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut]].\n\nThe conquest of the county of Holland by the Duke [[Philip the Good]] of Burgundy was an odd affair. Leading noblemen in Holland invited the duke to conquer Holland, even though he had no historical claim to it. Some historians{{Who|date=February 2010}} say that the ruling class in Holland wanted Holland to integrate with the [[Flanders|Flemish]] economic system and adopt Flemish legal institutions. Europe had been wracked by many civil wars in the 14th and 15th centuries, while Flanders had grown rich and enjoyed peace.\n\n== Burgundian and Habsburg period (1433\u20131567) ==\n[[File:Political map of the Low Countries (1350)-NL.svg|thumb|left|The Low Countries in the late 14th century CE.]]\n\n===Burgundian period===\n{{Main|Burgundian Netherlands}}\nMost of what is now the Netherlands and Belgium was eventually united by the Duke of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] in 1433. Before the Burgundian union, the Dutch identified themselves by the town they lived in, their local duchy or county or as subjects of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The Burgundian period is when the Dutch began the road to nationhood.\n\nHolland's trade developed rapidly, especially in the areas of shipping and transport. The new rulers defended Dutch trading interests. The fleets of Holland defeated the fleets of the [[Hanseatic League]] several times. Amsterdam grew and in the 15th century became the primary trading port in Europe for grain from the Baltic region. Amsterdam distributed grain to the major cities of Belgium, Northern France and England. This trade was vital to the people of Holland, because Holland could no longer produce enough grain to feed itself. Land drainage had caused the peat of the former [[wetland]]s to reduce to a level that was too low for drainage to be maintained.\n\n===Habsburg rule from Spain===\n{{Main|Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor}}\n[[File:Hadrian VI.jpg|thumb|Influential [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] theologian Adriaan Florenszoon Boeyens, 1459\u20131523, was an advisor to Charles; in the last year of his life he became pope as [[Pope Adrian VI]] (1522\u201323).]]\n[[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] (1500\u201358) was born and raised in the [[County of Flanders|Flemish]] city of [[Ghent]]; he spoke French.  Charles extended the Burgundian territory with the annexation of [[Tournai]], Artois, [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]], [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] and [[Guelders]]. The [[Seventeen Provinces]] had been unified by Charles's Burgundian ancestors, but nominally were [[fief]]s of either France or the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. When he was a minor, his aunt [[Margaret of Austria (1480-1530)|Margaret]] acted as regent until 1515. France relinquished its ancient claim on [[Flanders]] in 1528.<ref>{{cite book|author=James D.

J. - Erasmus - Louvre.jpg|left|thumb|[[Desiderius Erasmus]], 1466\u20131536, [[Rotterdam]] Renaissance humanist, Catholic priest and theologian, by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], 1523.]]\nFrom 1515 to 1523, Charles's government in the Netherlands had to contend with the rebellion of [[Arumer Zwarte Hoop|Frisian peasants]] (led by [[Pier Gerlofs Donia]] and [[Wijard Jelckama]]). [[Gelre]] attempted to build up its own state in northeast Netherlands and northwest Germany. Lacking funds in the 16th century, Gelre had its soldiers provide for themselves by pillaging enemy terrain. These soldiers were a great menace to the Burgundian Netherlands, as when they pillaged [[The Hague]].\n\nThe dukes of Burgundy over the years through astute marriages, purchases and wars, had taken control of the [[Seventeen Provinces]] that made up the Low Countries. They are now the Netherlands in the north, the [[Southern Netherlands]] (now Belgium) in the south, and Luxemburg in the southeast. Known as the \"Burgundian Circle,\" these lands came under the control of the Habsburg family. [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles]] (1500\u201358) became the owner in 1506, but in 1515 he left to become king of Spain and later became the Holy Roman Emperor. Charles turned over control to regents (his close relatives), and in practice rule was exercised by Spaniards he controlled. The provinces each had their own governments and courts, controlled by the local nobility, and their own traditions and rights (\"liberties\") dating back centuries. Likewise the numerous cities had their own legal rights and local governments, usually controlled by the merchants, On top of this the Spanish had imposed an overall government, the Estates General of the Netherlands, with its own officials and courts.<ref>H.G. Koenigsberger, \"The Beginnings of the States General of the Netherlands,\" ''Parliaments, Estates and Representation'' (1988) 8#2 pp 101\u201314.</ref> The Spanish officials sent by Charles ignored traditions and the Dutch nobility as well as local officials, inciting an anti-Spanish sense of nationalism, and leading to the [[Dutch Revolt]]. With the emergence of the Protestant Reformation, Charles\u2014now the Emperor\u2014was determined to crush Protestantism and never compromise with it. Unrest began in the south, centered in the large rich metropolis of Antwerp. The Netherlands was an especially rich unit of the Spanish realm, especially after the [[Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis]] of 1559; it ended four decades of warfare between France and Spain and allowed Spain to reposition its army.<ref name=\"Albert Guerard 1959 pp. 134\">Albert Guerard, ''France, A Modern History'', (1959), pp. 134\u201336.</ref>\n\nIn 1548, Charles granted the Netherlands status as an entity in which many of the laws of the Holy Roman Empire became obsolete.

Po-chia Hsia, ed. ''A Companion to the Reformation World'' (2006) pp. 118\u201334</ref> Dutch [[Protestants]], after initial repression, were tolerated by local authorities.

Israel, ''The Dutch Republic Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall 1477\u20131806'' (1995) p. 104</ref> In a society dependent on trade, freedom and tolerance were considered essential. Nevertheless, the Catholic rulers Charles V, and later [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], made it their mission to defeat Protestantism, which was considered a heresy by the Catholic Church and a threat to the stability of the whole hierarchical political system. On the other hand, the intensely moralistic Dutch Protestants insisted their Biblical theology, sincere piety and humble lifestyle was morally superior to the luxurious habits and superficial religiosity of the ecclesiastical nobility.<ref>Hsia, ed. ''A Companion to the Reformation World'' (2006) pp. 3\u201336</ref> The rulers' harsh punitive measures led to increasing grievances in the Netherlands, where the local governments had embarked on a course of peaceful coexistence. In the second half of the century, the situation escalated. Philip sent troops to crush the rebellion and make the Netherlands once more a Catholic region.<ref>Israel, ''The Dutch Republic Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall 1477\u20131806'' (1995) p. 155</ref>\n\nIn the first wave of the Reformation, [[Lutheranism]] won over the elites in Antwerp and the South.  The Spanish successfully suppressed it there, and Lutheranism only flourished in east Friesland.<ref>Israel, ''The Dutch Republic: Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall, 1477\u20131806'' (1995) pp. 374\u201375</ref>\n\nThe second wave of the Reformation, came in the form of [[Anabaptism]], that was popular among ordinary farmers in [[Holland]] and [[Friesland]]. Anabaptists were socially very radical and equalitarian; they believed that the apocalypse was very near. They refused to live the old way, and began new communities, creating considerable chaos. A prominent Dutch Anabaptist was [[Menno Simons]], who initiated the [[Mennonite]] church. The movement was allowed in the north, but never grew to a large scale.<ref>Israel, ''The Dutch Republic: Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall, 1477\u20131806'' (1995) pp. 86\u201391</ref>\n\nThe third wave of the Reformation, that ultimately proved to be permanent, was [[Calvinism]]. It arrived in the Netherlands in the 1540s, attracting both the elite and the common population, especially in [[Flanders]]. The Catholic Spanish responded with harsh persecution and introduced the [[Inquisition of the Netherlands]]. Calvinists rebelled. First there was the [[Beeldenstorm|iconoclasm]] in 1566, which was the systematic destruction of statues of saints and other Catholic devotional depictions in churches. In 1566, [[William the Silent]], a Calvinist, started the [[Eighty Years' War]] to liberate all Dutch of whatever religion from Catholic Spain. Blum says, \"His patience, tolerance, determination, concern for his people, and belief in government by consent held the Dutch together and kept alive their spirit of revolt.\"<ref>Jerome Blum et al, ''The European World: A History'' (1970) pp 160\u201361</ref>  The provinces of [[Holland]] and [[Zeeland]], being mainly Calvinist by 1572, submitted to the rule of William.

This treaty ended a forty-year period of warfare between France and Spain conducted in Italy from 1521 to 1559.<ref name=\"Albert Guerard 1959 pp. 134\"/> The Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis was somewhat of a watershed\u2014not only for the battleground that Italy had been, but also for northern Europe. Spain had been keeping troops in the Netherlands to be ready to attack France from the north as well as from the south.\n\nWith the settlement of so many major issues between France and Spain by the Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis, there was no longer any reason to keep Spanish troops in the Netherlands.  Thus, the people of the Netherlands could get on with their peacetime pursuits.  As they did so they found that there was a great deal of demand for their products.  Fishing had long been an important part of the economy of the Netherlands.  However, now the fishing of herring alone came to occupy 2,000 boats operating out of Dutch ports. Spain, still the Dutch trader's best customer, was buying fifty large ships full of furniture and household utensils from Flanders merchants. Additionally, Dutch woolen goods were desired everywhere.  The Netherlands bought and processed enough Spanish wool to sell four million florins of wool products through merchants in Bruges. So strong was the Dutch appetite for raw wool at this time that they bought nearly as much English wool as they did Spanish wool.  Total commerce with England alone amounted to 24 million florins.  Much of the export going to England resulted in pure profit to the Dutch because the exported items were of their own manufacture. The Netherlands was just starting to enter its \"Golden Age.\" Brabant and Flanders were the richest and most flourishing parts of the Dutch Republic at the time.<ref name=\"Claflin\">Claflin, W. Harold, ed. ''History of Nations: Holland and Belgium'', (New York: P.F. Collier & Son, 1907), pp. 72\u201374, 103\u201305</ref> The Netherlands was one of the richest places in the world. The population reached 3 million in 1560, with 25 cities of 10,000 people or more, by far the largest urban presence in Europe; with the trading and financial center of Antwerp being especially important (population 100,000). Spain could not afford to lose this rich land, nor allow it to fall from Catholic control. Thus came 80 years of warfare.\n\nA devout Catholic, Philip was appalled by the success of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in the [[Low Countries]], which had led to an increasing number of [[Calvinism|Calvinists]]. His attempts to enforce religious persecution of the Protestants, and his centralization of government, law enforcement, and taxes, made him unpopular and led to a [[revolt]]. [[Fernando Alvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba]], was sent with a Spanish Army to punish the unruly Dutch in 1567.<ref name=\"Motley\">John Lathrop Motley, ''The Rise of the Dutch Republic'' (Harper & Bros.: New York, 1855) pp. 106\u201315, 121, 122, 207, 213</ref>\n\nThe only opposition the Duke of Alba faced in his march across the Netherlands were the nobles, [[Lamoral, Count of Egmont]]; [[Philippe de Montmorency, Count of Horn]] and others. With the approach of Alba and the Spanish army, [[William the Silent]] of Orange fled to Germany with his three brothers and his whole family on 11 April 1567. The Duke of Alba sought to meet and negotiate with the nobles that now faced him with armies.  However, when the nobles arrived in Brussels they were all arrested and Egmont and Horn were executed.<ref name=\"Motley\"/> Alba then revoked all the prior treaties that Margaret, the [[Duchess of Parma]] had signed with the Protestants of the Netherlands and instituted the Inquisition to enforce the decrees of the [[Council of Trent]].\n\n==The Eighty Years' War (1568\u20131648)==\n{{Main|Eighty Years' War|Dutch Revolt}}\n[[File:Slag bij Nieuwpoort.jpg|thumb|[[Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange|Prince Maurits]] at the [[Battle of Nieuwpoort]], 1600 CE, by Paulus van Hillegaert.]]\n[[File:Leo belgicus.png|thumb|[[Leo Belgicus]], a map of the [[low countries]] drawn in the shape of a lion, by [[Claes Jansz. Visscher]] (II), 1609 CE.]]\nThe Dutch War for Independence from Spain is frequently called the [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568\u20131648).  The first fifty years (1568 through 1618) were uniquely a war between Spain and the Netherlands.  During the last thirty years (1618\u20131648) the conflict between Spain and the Netherlands was submerged in the general European War that became known as the [[Thirty Years' War]].<ref>Geoffrey Parker, ed. ''The Thirty Years' War'', New York: Routledge Press, 1987, p. 2.</ref>  The seven rebellious provinces of the Netherlands were eventually united by the [[Union of Utrecht]] in 1579 and formed the [[Republic of the Seven United Netherlands]] (also known as the \"United Provinces\"). The [[Act of Abjuration]] or ''Plakkaat van Verlatinghe'' was signed on 26 July 1581, and was the formal [[declaration of independence]] of the northern [[Low Countries]] from the Spanish king.\n\n[[William the Silent|William of Orange]] (Slot Dillenburg, 24 April 1533 \u2013 Delft, 10 July 1584), the founder of the Dutch royal family, led the Dutch during the first part of the war, following the death of Egmont and Horn in 1568. The very first years were a success for the Spanish troops. However, the Dutch countered subsequent sieges in [[Holland]]. In November and December 1572, all the citizens of [[Zutphen]] and [[Naarden]] were slaughtered by the Spanish. From 11 December that year the city of [[Haarlem]] was besieged, holding out for seven months until 13 July 1573. [[Oudewater]] was conquered by the Spanish on 7 August 1575, and most of its inhabitants were killed. [[Maastricht]] was besieged, sacked and destroyed twice in succession (in 1576 and 1579) by the Spanish.\n\nIn a war composed mostly of sieges rather than battles, [[Alexander Farnese, Prince of Parma|Governor-General Alexander Farnese]] proved his mettle. His strategy was to offer generous terms for the surrender of a city: there would be no more massacres or looting; historic urban privileges were retained; there was a full pardon and amnesty; return to the Catholic Church would be gradual. The conservative Catholics in the south and east supported the Spanish. Farnese recaptured [[Antwerp]] and nearly all of what became Belgium.<ref>Violet Soen, \"Reconquista and Reconciliation in the Dutch Revolt: The Campaign of Governor-General Alexander Farnese (1578\u20131592),\" ''[[Journal of Early Modern History]]'' (2012) 16#1 pp. 1\u201322.</ref> Most of the Dutch-speaking territory in the Netherlands was taken from Spain, but not in [[Flanders]], which to this day remains part of Belgium. Flanders was the most radical anti-Spanish territory. Many Flemish fled to Holland, among them half of the population of Antwerp, 3/4 of Bruges and Ghent and the entire population of Nieuwpoort, Dunkerque and countryside.<ref>Bart de Groof, \"Alexander Farnese and the Origins of Modern Belgium,\" ''Bulletin de l'Institut Historique Belge de Rome'' (1993) Vol. 63, pp. 195\u2013219.</ref> His successful campaign gave the Catholics control of the lower half of the Low Countries, and was part of the [[Counter-Reformation|Catholic Counter-Reformation]].\n\nThe war dragged on for another half century, but the main fighting was over. The [[Peace of Westphalia]], signed in 1648, confirmed the independence of the United Provinces from Spain. The Dutch people started to develop a national identity since the 15th century, but they officially remained a part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] until 1648. National identity was mainly formed by the province people came from. Holland was the most important province by far. The republic of the Seven Provinces came to be known as '''Holland''' across Europe.\n\nThe Catholics in the Netherlands were an outlawed minority that had been suppressed by the Calvinists. After 1572, however, they made a striking comeback (also as part of the Catholic Counter-Reformation), setting up seminaries, reforming their Church, and sending missionaries into Protestant districts. Laity often took the lead; the Calvinist government often arrested or harassed priests who seemed too effective. Catholic numbers stabilized at about a third of the population in the Netherlands; they were strongest in the southeast.<ref>see [http://www.quirksmode.org/politics/kuyper.html religion map]</ref><ref>Charles H.

During the Golden Age, there was a great flowering of trade, industry, the arts and the sciences in the Netherlands. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the Dutch were arguably the most economically wealthy and scientifically advanced of all European nations. This new, officially Calvinist nation flourished culturally and economically, creating what historian [[Simon Schama]] has called an \"embarrassment of riches\".<ref name=\"Schama\">Schama, Simon, ''The Embarrassment of Riches'', Bath: William Collins & Sons, 1987. At p. 8: \"The prodigious quality of their success went to their heads, but it also made them a bit queasy. Even their most uninhibited documents of self-congratulations are haunted by the threat of ''overvloed'', the surfeit that rose like a cresting flood \u2013 a word heavy with warning as well as euphoria...But at the very least, the continuous pricking of conscience on complacency produced the self-consciousness that we think of as embarrassed.\"</ref> [[Tulip mania|Speculation in the tulip trade]] led to a first stock market crash in 1637, but the economic crisis was soon overcome.

In 1602 the [[Dutch East India Company]] (Dutch: ''Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie'' or ''VOC'') was founded. It was the first-ever [[multinational corporation]], financed by shares that established the [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange|first modern stock exchange]]. It became the world's largest commercial enterprise of the 17th century. To finance the growing trade within the region, the [[Bank of Amsterdam]] was established in 1609, the precursor to, if not the first true [[central bank]].<ref>Quinn, Stephen. Roberds, William.

In 1640 by the [[Dutch East India Company]] began a trade monopoly with Japan through the trading post on [[Dejima]].\n\nThe Dutch also dominated trade between European countries. The Low Countries were favorably positioned on a crossing of east-west and north-south trade routes and connected to a large German hinterland through the [[Rhine]] river. Dutch traders shipped wine from France and Portugal to the [[Baltic region|Baltic lands]] and returned with grain destined for countries around the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

Natuurkundige te Delft Rijksmuseum SK-A-957.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] was a businessman and scientist in the [[Dutch Golden Age|Golden Age of Dutch science and technology]].]]\n[[Renaissance Humanism]], of which [[Desiderius Erasmus]] (c. 1466\u20131536) was an important advocate, had also gained a firm foothold and was partially responsible for a climate of tolerance. Overall, levels of tolerance were sufficiently high to attract religious refugees from other countries, notably Jewish merchants from [[Portugal]] who brought much wealth with them. The revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] in France in 1685 resulted in the immigration of many French [[Huguenots]], many of whom were shopkeepers or scientists. Still tolerance had its limits, as philosopher [[Baruch de Spinoza]] (1632\u20131677) would find out. Due to its climate of intellectual tolerance the Dutch Republic attracted scientists and other thinkers from all over Europe. Especially the renowned [[University of Leiden]] (established in 1575 by the Dutch [[stadtholder]], [[William the Silent|William of Oranje]], as a token of gratitude for Leiden's fierce resistance against Spain during the Eighty Years' War) became a gathering place for these people. For instance French philosopher [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] lived in Leiden from 1628 until 1649.\n\nDutch lawyers were famous for their knowledge of international [[Admiralty law|law of the sea]] and [[commercial law]]. [[Hugo Grotius]] (1583\u20131645) played a leading part in the foundation of [[international law]]. Again due to the Dutch climate of tolerance, book publishers flourished. Many books about religion, philosophy and science that might have been deemed controversial abroad were printed in the Netherlands and secretly exported to other countries. Thus during the 17th century the Dutch Republic became more and more Europe's publishing house.\n\n[[File:Meisje met de parel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Johannes Vermeer]]'s ''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring]]'']]\n\n[[Christiaan Huygens]] (1629\u20131695) was a famous [[astronomer]], [[physicist]] and mathematician. He invented the [[pendulum clock]], which was a major step forward towards exact timekeeping. He contributed to the fields of [[optics]]. The most famous Dutch scientist in the area of optics is certainly [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]], who invented or greatly improved the [[microscope]] (opinions differ) and was the first to methodically study microscopic life, thus laying the foundations for the field of [[microbiology]]. Famous Dutch hydraulic engineer [[Jan Leeghwater]] (1575\u20131650) gained important victories in The Netherlands's eternal battle against the sea. Leeghwater added a considerable amount of land to the republic by converting several large lakes into [[polder]]s, pumping all water out with windmills.\n\nPainting was the dominant art form in 17th-century Holland. [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] followed many of the tendencies that dominated [[Baroque art]] in other parts of Europe, as with the [[Utrecht Caravaggisti]], but was the leader in developing the subjects of [[still life]], [[landscape painting|landscape]], and [[genre painting]]. [[Portrait]]ure were also popular, but [[history painting]] \u2013 traditionally the [[hierarchy of genres|most-elevated genre]] struggled to find buyers.  Church art was virtually non-existent, and little sculpture of any kind produced. While art collecting and painting for the open market was also common elsewhere, art historians point to the growing number of wealthy Dutch middle-class and successful mercantile patrons as driving forces in the popularity of certain pictorial subjects.<ref name=\"gardner\">Gardner, Helen, Fred S. Kleiner, and Christin J. Mamiya, ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages'', Belmont, CA: [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2005, pp. 718\u201319.</ref> Today, the best-known painters of the Dutch Golden Age are the period's most dominant figure [[Rembrandt]], the [[Delft]] master of genre [[Johannes Vermeer]], the innovative landscape painter [[Jacob van Ruisdael]], and [[Frans Hals]], who infused new life into portraiture. Some notable artistic styles and trends include Haarlem [[Mannerism]], [[Utrecht Caravaggism]], the [[Delft School (painting)|School of Delft]], the Leiden [[fijnschilder]]s, and Dutch [[classicism]].\n\n[[File:Den Haag, Mauritshuis vanaf Hofvijver 2006-05-29 16.12.JPG|thumb|The [[Dutch Baroque architecture|Dutch Classicist]] [[Mauritshuis]], named after [[John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen|Prince Johan Maurits]] and built 1636\u20131641, was designed by [[Jacob van Campen]] and [[Pieter Post]].]]\nDue to the thriving economy, cities expanded greatly. New town halls, weighhouses and storehouses were built. Merchants that had gained a fortune ordered a new house built along one of the many new canals that were dug out in and around many cities (for defence and transport purposes), a house with an ornamented fa\u00e7ade that befitted their new status. In the countryside, many new castles and stately homes were built. Most of them have not survived. Starting at 1595 Reformed churches were commissioned, many of which are still landmarks today. The most famous Dutch architects of the 17th century were [[Jacob van Campen]], [[Pieter Post]], Pieter Vingbooms, [[Lieven de Key]], [[Hendrick de Keyser]]. Overall, Dutch architecture, which generally combined traditional building styles with some foreign elements, did not develop to the level of painting.\n\nThe Golden Age was also an important time for developments in literature. Some of the major figures of this period were [[Gerbrand Adriaenszoon Bredero]], [[Jacob Cats]], [[Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft]] and [[Joost van den Vondel]]. Since Latin was the lingua franca of education, relatively few men could speak, write, and read Dutch all at the same time.\n\nMusic did not develop very much in the Netherlands since the Calvinists considered it an unnecessary extravagance, and organ music was forbidden in Reformed Church services, although it remained common at secular functions.\n\n==Dutch Empire==\n\n=== The Dutch in the Americas ===\n[[File:GezichtOpNieuwAmsterdam.jpg|thumb|left|200px|New Amsterdam in 1664 CE.]]\n{{main|Dutch West India Company|New Netherland|New Amsterdam}}\n\nThe Dutch West India Company was a [[chartered company]] (known as the \"GWC\") of Dutch merchants. On 2 June 1621, it was granted a [[:wikisource:Charter of the Dutch West India Company|charter]] for a trade monopoly in the [[West Indies]] (meaning the Caribbean) by the [[Republic of the Seven United Netherlands]] and given jurisdiction over the [[African slave trade]], Brazil, the [[Caribbean]], and North America. Its area of operations stretched from West Africa to the Americas, and the Pacific islands. The company became instrumental in the [[Dutch colonization of the Americas]]. The first forts and settlements in [[Guyana]] and on the [[Amazon River]] date from the 1590s. Actual colonization, with Dutch settling in the new lands, was not as common as with England and France. Many of the Dutch settlements were lost or abandoned by the end of that century, but the Netherlands managed to retain possession of [[Suriname]] and a number of Dutch Caribbean islands.\n\n[[File:Peter Stuyvesant.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Peter Stuyvesant]], Director-General of [[New Netherland]] (New York). His provincial capital, [[New Amsterdam]], was located at the southern tip of the island of [[Manhattan]].]]\nThe colony was a private business venture to exploit the [[fur trade]] in beaver pelts. New Netherland was slowly settled during its first decades, partially as a result of policy mismanagement by the [[Dutch West India Company]] (WIC), and conflicts with Native Americans. During the 1650s, the colony experienced dramatic growth and became a major port for trade in the [[Atlantic World]], tolerating a highly diverse ethnic mix. The surrender of [[Fort Amsterdam]] to the British control in 1664 was formalized in 1667, contributing to the [[Second Anglo\u2013Dutch War]].

Shortly thereafter, the [[Dutch East India Company]] (in the Dutch of the day: ''Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie'', or VOC) decided to establish a permanent settlement. The VOC, one of the major European trading houses sailing the [[Spice trade|spice route]] to East Asia, had no intention of colonizing the area, instead wanting only to establish a secure base camp where passing ships could shelter, and where hungry sailors could stock up on fresh supplies of meat, fruit, and vegetables.

This arrangement proved highly successful, producing abundant supplies of fruit, vegetables, wheat, and wine; they also later raised livestock. The small initial group of \"free burghers\", as these farmers were known, steadily increased in number and began to expand their farms further north and east.\n\nThe majority of burghers had [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch ancestry]] and belonged to the [[Calvinist Reformed Church of the Netherlands]], but there were also numerous Germans as well as some Scandinavians. In 1688 the Dutch and the Germans were joined by French [[Huguenots]], also Calvinists, who were fleeing religious persecution in France under [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]]. The [[Huguenots in South Africa]] were absorbed into the Dutch population but they played a prominent role in South Africa's history.\n\nFrom the beginning, the VOC used the cape as a place to supply ships travelling between the Netherlands and the [[Dutch East Indies]]. There was a close association between the cape and these Dutch possessions in the far east. Van Riebeeck and the VOC began to import large numbers of slaves, primarily from [[Madagascar]] and [[Indonesia]]. These slaves often married Dutch settlers, and their descendants became known as the [[Cape Coloureds]] and the [[Cape Malays]].\n\n[[File:Aernout Smit Table Bay, 1683 William Fehr Collection Cape Town.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Table Bay|De Tafelbaai]] by Aernout Smit, 1683.]]\nDuring the 18th century, the Dutch settlement in the area of the cape grew and prospered. By the late 1700s, the [[Dutch Cape Colony|Cape Colony]] was one of the best developed European settlements outside Europe or the Americas.<ref name=\"Smith\">Smith, Adam (1776), [http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/adam-smith/Wealth-Nations.pdf Wealth of Nations] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020042323/http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/adam-smith/Wealth-Nations.pdf |date=20 October 2013 }}, Penn State Electronic Classics Edition, republished 2005, p. 516</ref> The two bases of the Cape Colony's economy for almost the entirety of its history were shipping and agriculture. Its strategic position meant that almost every ship sailing between Europe and Asia stopped off at the colony's capital [[Cape Town]]. The supplying of these ships with fresh provisions, fruit, and [[South African wine|wine]] provided a very large market for the surplus produce of the colony.<ref name=\"Smith\"/>\n\nSome free burghers continued to expand into the rugged hinterlands of the north and east, many began to take up a semi-nomadic [[pastoralism|pastoralist]] lifestyle, in some ways not far removed from that of the [[Khoikhoi]] they had displaced. In addition to its herds, a family might have a [[wagon]], a [[tent]], a Bible, and a few guns. As they became more settled, they would build a [[mud]]-walled [[cottage]], frequently located, by choice, days of travel from the nearest European settlement. These were the first of the [[Trekboer]]s (Wandering Farmers, later shortened to [[Boer]]s), completely independent of official controls, extraordinarily self-sufficient, and isolated from the government and the main settlement in [[Cape Town]].\n\n[[File:TrekBoers crossing the Karoo.jpg|thumb|left|200px|An account of the first [[trekboer]]s.]]\n[[Dutch language|Dutch]] was the official language, but a dialect had formed that was quite distinct from Dutch.

They seized the Cape Colony in 1795 to prevent it from falling into French hands, then briefly relinquished it back to the Dutch (1803), before definitively conquering it in 1806. British [[sovereignty]] of the area was recognised at the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815. By the time the Dutch colony was seized by the British in 1806, it had grown into an established settlement with 25,000 slaves, 20,000 white colonists, 15,000 [[Khoisan]], and 1,000 freed black slaves. Outside Cape Town and the immediate hinterland, isolated black and white [[pastoralists]] populated the country.\n\nDutch interest in South Africa was mainly as a strategically located VOC port. Yet in the 17th and 18th centuries the Dutch created the foundation of the modern state of South Africa. The Dutch legacy in South Africa is evident everywhere, but particularly in the [[Afrikaner]] people and the [[Afrikaans]] language.\n\n==Dutch Republic: Regents and Stadholders (1649\u20131784)==\n{{main|Dutch Republic}}\n[[File:Hendrick Avercamp - A Scene on the Ice - WGA01076.jpg|thumb|''Skating fun'', a traditional rural scene by 17th-century Dutch painter [[Hendrick Avercamp]].]]\n\nThe Netherlands gained independence from Spain as a result of the [[Eighty Years' War]], during which the Dutch Republic was founded. As the Netherlands was a republic, it was largely governed by an aristocracy of city-merchants called the [[Regenten|regents]], rather than by a king. Every city and province had its own government and laws, and a large degree of autonomy. After attempts to find a competent sovereign proved unsuccessful, it was decided that [[sovereignty]] would be vested in the various provincial Estates, the governing bodies of the provinces. The [[Estates-General of the Netherlands|Estates-General]], with its representatives from all the provinces, would decide on matters important to the Republic as a whole. However, at the head of each province was the [[stadtholder]] of that province, a position held by a descendant of the [[House of Orange-Nassau|House of Orange]]. Usually the stadtholdership of several provinces was held by a single man.\n\nAfter having gained its independence in 1648, the Netherlands tried in various coalitions to help to contain France, which had replaced Spain as the strongest nation of Europe. The end of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1713) marked the end of the Dutch Republic as a major player. In the 18th century, it just tried to maintain its independence and stuck to a policy of neutrality.\n\nThe economy, based on Amsterdam's role as the center of world trade, remained robust. In 1670 the Dutch merchant marine totalled 568,000 tons of shipping\u2014about half the European total.<ref>{{cite book|author=Tim William Blanning|title=The Pursuit of Glory: Europe, 1648\u20131815|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rmkcaEfwcsQC&pg=PA96|year=2007|publisher=Penguin|page=96|isbn=9780670063208}}</ref> The province of Holland was highly commercial and dominated the country.  Its nobility was small and closed and had little influence, for it was numerically small, politically weak, and formed a strictly closed caste. Most land in the province of Holland was commercialized for cash crops and was owned by urban capitalists, not nobles; there were few links between Holland's nobility and the merchants. By 1650 the burgher families which had grown wealthy through commerce and become influential in government controlled the province of Holland, and to a large extent shaped national policies. The other six provinces were more rural and traditional in life style, had an active nobility, and played a small role in commerce and national politics.  Instead they concentrated on their flood protections and land reclamation projects.<ref>{{cite book|author=E.H. Kossmann, \"The Dutch Republic,\" in F. L.

Many immigrants came to the cities of Holland in the 17th and 18th century from the Protestant parts of Germany and elsewhere. The amount of first generation immigrants from outside the Netherlands in Amsterdam was nearly 50% in the 17th and 18th centuries. Indeed, Amsterdam's population consisted primarily of immigrants, if one includes second and third generation immigrants and migrants from the Dutch countryside. People in most parts of Europe were poor and many were unemployed. But in Amsterdam there was always work. Tolerance was important, because a continuous influx of immigrants was necessary for the economy. Travellers visiting Amsterdam reported their surprise at the lack of control over the influx.\n\n===Economic growth===\n{{main|Economic history of the Netherlands (1500\u20131815)}}\nThe era of explosive economic growth is roughly coterminous with the period of social and cultural bloom that has been called the [[Dutch Golden Age]], and that actually formed the material basis for that cultural era.  Amsterdam became the hub of world trade, the center into which staples and luxuries flowed for sorting, processing, and distribution, and then reexported around Europe and the world.<ref>{{cite book|author=Joost Jonker|title=Merchants, bankers, middlemen: the Amsterdam money market during the first half of the 19th century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8xwWAQAAMAAJ|year=1996|publisher=NEHA|page=32|isbn=9789057420016}}</ref>\n\nDuring 1585 through 1622 there was the rapid accumulation of trade capital, often brought in by refugee merchantes from Antwerp and other ports.  The money was typically invested in high-risk ventures like pioneering expeditions to the [[East Indies]] to engage in the [[spice trade]]. These ventures were soon consolidated in the [[Dutch East India Company]] ('''VOC'''). There were similar ventures in different fields however, like the trade on Russia and the [[Levant]]. The profits of these ventures were ploughed back in the financing of new trade, which led to its exponential growth.<ref>Charles R. Boxer, ''The Dutch Seaborne Empire 1600\u20131800'' (1965)</ref>\n\nRapid industrialization led to the rapid growth of the nonagricultural labor force and the increase in real wages during the same time. In the half-century between 1570 and 1620 this labor supply increased 3 percent per annum, a truly phenomenal growth. Despite this, nominal wages were repeatedly increased, outstripping price increases. In consequence, real wages for unskilled laborers were 62 percent higher in 1615\u20131619 than in 1575\u20131579.<ref>Jan de Vries and A. van der Woude, ''The First Modern Economy.

The city contributed the largest quota in taxes to the States of Holland which in turn contributed over half the quota to the States General. Amsterdam was also one of the most reliable in settling tax demands and therefore was able to use the threat to withhold such payments to good effect.<ref>Regin, Deric, ''Traders, Artists, Burghers: A Cultural History of Amsterdam in the 17th century'' Van Gorcum, 1976, p. {{Page needed|date=October 2011}}</ref>\n\nAmsterdam was governed by a body of regents, a large, but closed, oligarchy with control over all aspects of the city's life, and a dominant voice in the foreign affairs of Holland. Only men with sufficient wealth and a long enough residence within the city could join the ruling class. The first step for an ambitious and wealthy merchant family was to arrange a marriage with a long-established regent family. In the 1670s one such union, that of the Trip family (the Amsterdam branch of the Swedish arms makers) with the son of Burgomaster Valckenier, extended the influence and patronage available to the latter and strengthened his dominance of the council. The oligarchy in Amsterdam thus gained strength from its breadth and openness. In the smaller towns family interest could unite members on policy decisions but contraction through intermarriage could lead to the degeneration of the quality of the members.\n\nIn Amsterdam the network was so large that members of the same family could be related to opposing factions and pursue widely separated interests.  The young men who had risen to positions of authority in the 1670s and 1680s consolidated their hold on office well into the 1690s and even the new century.<ref>Edwards, Elizabeth, \"Amsterdam and William III,\" ''History Today,'' (Dec 1993), Vol. 43, Issue 12 pp. 25\u201331</ref>\n\nAmsterdam's regents provided good services to residents. They spent heavily on the water-ways and other essential infrastructure, as well as municipal almshouses for the elderly, hospitals and churches.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Elise Van Nederveen Meerkerk|author2=Griet Vermeesch|title=Serving the Urban Community: The Rise of Public Facilities in the Low Countries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GyqI-UjSTy8C&pg=PA158|year=2010|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|page=158|isbn=9789052603506}}</ref>\n\nAmsterdam's wealth was generated by its commerce, which was in turn sustained by the judicious encouragement of entrepreneurs whatever their origin. This open door policy has been interpreted as proof of a tolerant ruling class. But toleration was practiced for the convenience of the city. Therefore, the wealthy Sephardic Jews from Portugal were welcomed and accorded all privileges except those of citizenship, but the poor Ashkenazi Jews from Eastern Europe were far more carefully vetted and those who became dependent on the city were encouraged to move on.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Paolo Bernardini|author2=Norman Fiering|title=The Jews and the Expansion of Europe to the West, 1400\u20131800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m0JAGMuePO0C&pg=PA372|year=2004|publisher=Berghahn Books|page=372|isbn=9781571814302}}</ref> Similarly, provision for the housing of Huguenot immigrants was made in 1681 when [[Louis XIV]]'s religious policy was beginning to drive these Protestants out of France; no encouragement was given to the dispossessed Dutch from the countryside or other towns of Holland.

The former\u2014the Orangists\u2014were soldiers and centralizers who seldom spoke of compromise with the enemy and looked for military solutions. They included many rural gentry as well as ordinary folk attached to the banner of the [[House of Orange-Nassau|House of Orange]].

The regents seized the opportunity: there would be no new stadtholder in Holland for 22 years. [[Johan de Witt]], a brilliant politician and diplomat, emerged as the dominant figure.  Princes of Orange became the stadtholder and an almost hereditary ruler in 1672 and 1748. The Dutch Republic of the United Provinces was a true republic from 1650 to 1672 and 1702\u20131748. These periods are called the [[First Stadtholderless Period]] and [[Second Stadtholderless Period]].\n\n===Anglo-Dutch wars===\n[[File:Vonstetinaseconddayof4daybattleof1666.jpg|thumb|\"The Second Day of the Four Day Battle of 1666\"]]\n{{main|Anglo-Dutch wars}}\nThe Republic and England were major rivals in world trade and naval power. Halfway through the 17th century the Republic's [[Royal Netherlands Navy|navy]] was the rival of Britain's Royal Navy as the most powerful navy in the world.  The Republic fought a series of three [[Anglo-Dutch wars|naval wars against England]] in 1652\u201374.<ref>{{cite book|author=John Richard Hill|title=The Oxford Illustrated History of the Royal Navy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bzrya4r-2n8C&pg=PA73|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=68\u201375|isbn=9780198605270}}</ref>\n\nIn 1651, England imposed its first [[1651 Navigation Act|Navigation Act]], which severely hurt Dutch trade interests. An incident at sea concerning the Act resulted in the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]], which lasted from 1652 to 1654, ending in the [[Treaty of Westminster (1654)]], which left the Navigation Act in effect.\n\nAfter the [[English Restoration]] in 1660, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] tried to serve his dynastic interests by attempting to make [[William III of England|Prince William III of Orange]], his nephew, [[stadtholder]] of the Republic, using some military pressure. King Charles thought a naval war would weaken the Dutch traders and strengthen the English economy and empire, so the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] was launched in 1665. At first many Dutch ships were captured and the English scored great victories.  However, the [[Raid on the Medway]], in June 1667, ended the war with a Dutch victory. The Dutch recovered their trade, while the English economy was seriously hurt and its treasury nearly bankrupt.<ref>Gijs Rommelse, \"Prizes and Profits: Dutch Maritime Trade during the Second Anglo-Dutch War,\" ''International Journal of Maritime History'' (2007) 19#2 pp 139\u201359.</ref> The greatly expanded Dutch navy was for years after the world's strongest.

England declared war on the Republic, (the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]]), followed by France, [[M\u00fcnster]] and [[Cologne]], which had all signed alliances against the Republic. France, Cologne and M\u00fcnster invaded the Republic. Johan de Witt and his brother Cornelis, who had accomplished a diplomatic balancing act for a long time, were now the obvious scapegoats. They were lynched, and a new [[stadtholder]], William III, was appointed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Johan-De-Witt|title=Johan De Witt|date=20 September 2018|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|access-date=20 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nAn Anglo-French attempt to land on the Dutch shore was barely repelled in three desperate naval battles under command of [[Admiral (Netherlands)|Admiral]] [[Michiel de Ruyter]]. The advance of French troops from the south was halted by a costly inundation of its own heartland, by breaching river dikes. With the aid of friendly German princes, the Dutch succeeded in fighting back [[Cologne]] and [[M\u00fcnster]], after which the peace was signed with both of them, although some territory in the east was lost forever. Peace was signed with England as well, in 1674 ([[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Second Treaty of Westminster]]). In 1678, peace was made with France at the [[Treaty of Nijmegen]], although France's Spanish and German allies felt betrayed by this.\n\nIn 1688, the relations with England reached crisis level once again. Stadtholder [[William III of England|William III]] decided he had to take a huge gamble when he was invited to invade England by Protestant British nobles feuding with William's father-in-law the Catholic [[James II of England]]. This led to the [[Glorious Revolution]] and cemented the principle of parliamentary rule and Protestant ascendency in England.  James fled to France, and William ascended to the English throne as co-monarch with his wife Mary, James' eldest daughter.  This manoeuvre secured England as a critical ally of the United Provinces in its ongoing wars with [[Louis XIV of France]].  William was the commander of the Dutch and English armies and fleets until his death in 1702.  During William's reign as King of England, his primary focus was leveraging British manpower and finances to aid the Dutch against the French.  The combination continued after his death as the combined Dutch, British, and mercenary army conquered Flanders and Brabant, and invaded French territory before the alliance collapsed in 1713 due to British political infighting.\n\n===Second Stadtholderless Period (1702\u20131747)===\n{{main| Second Stadtholderless Period}}\n[[File:Cornelis Troost02.jpg|thumb|The Inspectors of the Collegium Medicum in Amsterdam, by [[Cornelis Troost]], 1724. This period is known as the \"Periwig Era\".]]\n\nThe ''Second Stadtholderless Period'' ({{lang-nl|Tweede Stadhouderloze Tijdperk}}) is the designation in Dutch [[historiography]] of the period between the death of [[stadtholder]] [[William III of England|William III]] on 19 March<ref>This is the date from the [[Gregorian calendar]] that was followed at the time in the Dutch Republic; according to the [[Julian calendar]], still used in England at the time, the date of death was 8 March.</ref> 1702 and the appointment of [[William IV, Prince of Orange]] as stadtholder and captain general in all provinces of the [[Dutch Republic]] on 2 May 1747. During this period the office of stadtholder was left vacant in the provinces of [[Holland]], [[Zeeland]], and [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]], though in other provinces that office was filled by members of the House of Nassau-Dietz (later called Orange-Nassau) during various periods.\n\nDuring the period, the Republic lost its Great-Power status and its primacy in world trade, processes that went hand-in-hand, the latter causing the former. Though the economy declined considerably, causing deindustralization and deurbanization in the maritime provinces, a ''rentier''-class kept accumulating a large capital fund that formed the basis for the leading position the Republic achieved in the international capital market. A military crisis at the end of the period caused the fall of the [[Dutch States Party|States-Party regime]] and the restoration of the Stadtholderate in all provinces. However, though the new stadtholder acquired near-dictatorial powers, this did not improve the situation.\n\n===Economic decline after 1730===\nThe slow economic decline after 1730 was relative: other countries grew faster, eroding the Dutch lead and surpassing it. Wilson identifies three causes. Holland lost its world dominance in trade as competitors emerged and copied its practices, built their own ships and ports, and traded on their own account directly without going through Dutch intermediaries. Second, there was no growth in manufacturing, due perhaps to a weaker sense of industrial entrepreneurship and to the high wage scale. Third the wealthy turned their investments to foreign loans. This helped jump-start other nations and provided the Dutch with a steady income from collecting interest, but leaving them with few domestic sectors with a potential for rapid growth.<ref>C. H. Wilson, \"The Economic Decline of the Netherlands,\" ''Economic History Review'' (1939) 9#2 pp. 111\u2013127, esp. p. 113  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2590218 in JSTOR]</ref><ref>Israel, ''Dutch Republic'', pp. 999\u20131018</ref>\n\nAfter the Dutch fleet declined, merchant interests became dependent on the goodwill of Britain. The main focus of Dutch leaders was reducing the country's considerable budget deficits. Dutch trade and shipping remained at a fairly steady level through the 18th century, but no longer had a near monopoly and also could not match growing English and French competition. The Netherlands lost its position as the trading centre of Northern Europe to London.\n\nAlthough the Netherlands remained wealthy, investors for the nation's money became more difficult to find. Some investment went into purchases of land for estates, but most went to foreign bonds and Amsterdam remained one of Europe's banking capitals.\n\n===Culture and society===\nDutch culture also declined both in the arts and sciences. Literature for example largely imitated English and French styles with little in the way of innovation or originality.  The most influential intellectual was [[Pierre Bayle]] (1647\u20131706), a Protestant refugee from France who settled in Rotterdam where he wrote the massive [[Dictionnaire Historique et Critique]] (''Historical and Critical Dictionary'', 1696). It had a major impact on the thinking of [[The Enlightenment]] across Europe, giving an arsenal of weapons to critics who wanted to attack religion. It was an encyclopaedia of ideas that argued that most \"truths\" were merely opinions, and that gullibility and stubbornness were prevalent.<ref>Thomas M. Lennon and Michael Hickson, \"Pierre Bayle,\" ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (2012) [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bayle/ online]</ref>\n\nLife for the average Dutchman became slower and more relaxed than in the 18th century. The upper and middle classes continued to enjoy prosperity and high living standards. The drive to succeed seemed less urgent. Unskilled laborers remained locked in poverty and hardship. The large underclass of unemployed beggars and riffraff required government and private charity to survive.\n\nReligious life became more relaxed as well. Catholics grew from 18% to 23% of the population during the 18th century and enjoyed greater tolerance, even as they continued to be outside the political system. They became divided by the feud between moralistic Jansenists (who denied free will) and orthodox believers. One group of Jansenists formed a splinter sect, the [[Old Catholic Church]] in 1723. The upper classes willingly embraced the ideas of the Enlightenment, tempered by the tolerance that meant less hostility to organized religion compared to France.<ref>Israel, ''Dutch Republic'', pp. 1021, 1033\u201336</ref>\n\n===The Orangist revolution (1747\u20131751)===\n{{Main|Second Stadtholderless Period}}\n[[File:StadhouderWillemIV(4).jpg|thumb|left|[[William IV, Prince of Orange]], stadholder from 1747 to 1751 CE.]]\n[[File:Willem v (2).jpg|thumb|left|[[Willem V of Orange]], stadholder from 1751 to 1806, and [[Wilhelmina of Prussia, Princess of Orange|Wilhelmina of Prussia]] with three of their five children.

This started as a Prusso-Austrian conflict, but eventually all the neighbours of the [[Dutch Republic]] became involved. On one side were Prussia, France and their allies and on the other Austria, Britain (after 1744) and their allies. At first the Republic strove to remain neutral in this European conflict, but it maintained garrisons in a number of fortresses in the [[Austrian Netherlands]]. French grievances and threats spurred the Republic into bring its army up to European standards (84,000 men in 1743).<ref name=\"Israel\">Israel, Jonathan ''The Dutch Republic: Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall 1477\u20131806'' (\"Oxford\" Oxford U.P. 1998)  pp. 996\u201397, 1069\u201387</ref>\n\nIn 1744 and 1745 the French attacked Dutch fortresses at [[Menen]] and [[Tournai]]. This prompted the [[Dutch Republic]] in 1745 to join the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance|Quadruple Alliance]], but this alliance was severely defeated at the [[Battle of Fontenoy]] in May 1745. In 1746 the French occupied most of the large cities in the [[Austrian Netherlands]]. Then, in April 1747, apparently as an exercise in armed diplomacy, a relatively small French military force occupied [[Zeelandic Flanders]], part of the Dutch Republic.<ref name=\"Israel\"/>\n\nThis relatively innocuous invasion fully exposed the rot underlying the Dutch defences.  The consequences were spectacular.  Still mindful of the French invasion in the [[Rampjaar|\"Disaster Year\" of 1672]], many fearful people clamored for the restoration of the stadtholderate.<ref name=Israel/> [[William IV, Prince of Orange]], had been waiting impatiently in the wings since acquiring his princely title in 1732.  Over the next year he and his supporters engaged in a number of political battles in various provinces and towns in the Netherlands to wrest control from the [[regenten|regents]]. The aim was for William IV to obtain a firm grip on government patronage and place loyal officials in all strategic government positions. Eventually he managed to achieve this aim in all provinces.<ref name=Israel/>\n\n[[Willem Bentinck van Rhoon]] was a prominent Orangist. People like Bentinck hoped that gathering the reins of power in the hands of a single \"eminent head\" would soon help restore the state of the Dutch economy and finances. The regents they opposed included the Grand Pensionary [[Jacob Gilles]] and Adriaen van der Hoop. This popular revolt had religious, anti-Catholic and democratic overtones and sometimes involved mob violence. It eventually involved political agitation by [[Daniel Raap]], [[Jean Rousset de Missy]] and the [[Doelisten]], attacks on [[Tax farming|tax farmers]] ([[pachtersoproer]]), religious agitation for enforcement of the Sabbath laws and preference for followers of [[Gisbertus Voetius]] and various demands by the civil militia.<ref name=Israel/>\n\nThe war against the French was itself brought to a not-too-devastating end for the [[Dutch Republic]] with the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)]]. The French retreated of their own accord from the Dutch frontier. William IV died unexpectedly, at the age of 40, on 22 October 1751.<ref name=Israel/>\n\n===Regency and indolent rule (1752\u20131779)===\nHis son, [[William V, Prince of Orange|William V]], was 3 years old when his father died, and a long regency characterised by corruption and misrule began. His mother delegated most of the powers of the regency to Bentinck and her favorite, [[Duke Louis Ernest of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]]. All power was concentrated in the hands of an unaccountable few, including the Frisian nobleman [[Douwe Sirtema van Grovestins]].<ref name=Israel/> Still a teenager, William V assumed the position of [[stadtholder]] in 1766, the last to hold that office. In 1767, he married [[Wilhelmina of Prussia, Princess of Orange|Princess Wilhelmina of Prussia]], the daughter of [[Prince Augustus William of Prussia|Augustus William of Prussia]], niece of [[Frederick the Great]].\n\nThe position of the Dutch during the [[American War of Independence]] was one of [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]]. William V, leading the pro-British faction within the government, blocked attempts by pro-independence, and later pro-French, elements to drag the government to war. However, things came to a head with the Dutch attempt to join the Russian-led [[First League of Armed Neutrality|League of Armed Neutrality]], leading to the outbreak of the disastrous [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War]] in 1780. After the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], the impoverished nation grew restless under William's rule.\n\nAn English historian summed him up uncharitably as \"a Prince of the profoundest lethargy and most abysmal stupidity.\"<ref>Fulford, Roger ''Royal Dukes'' William Collins and Son London 1933</ref> And yet he would guide his family through the difficult French-Batavian period and his son would be crowned king.\n\n===Fourth Anglo-Dutch War (1780\u20131784)===\n{{Main|Fourth Anglo-Dutch War}}\n[[File:The Battle of the Dogger Bank 5 August 1781.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Dogger Bank (1781)]] by [[Thomas Luny]].]]\nThe [[Fourth Anglo\u2013Dutch War]] (1780\u20131784) was a conflict between the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and the [[Dutch Republic]]. The war, tangentially related to the [[American Revolutionary War]], broke out over British and Dutch disagreements on the legality and conduct of Dutch trade with Britain's enemies in that war.\n\nAlthough the Dutch Republic did not enter into a formal alliance with the United States and their allies, U.S. ambassador (and future President) [[John Adams]] managed to establish diplomatic relations with the Dutch Republic, making it the second European country to diplomatically recognize the [[Continental Congress]] in April 1782. In October 1782, a treaty of amity and commerce was concluded as well.\n\nMost of the war consisted of a series of largely successful British operations against Dutch colonial economic interests, although British and Dutch naval forces also [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1781)|met once off the Dutch coast]].  The war ended disastrously for the Dutch and exposed the weakness of the political and economic foundations of the country.<ref>Edler, Friedrich, ''The Dutch Republic and The American Revolution'' (1911, reprinted 2001) Honolulu, Hawaii: University Press of the Pacific, p. 88</ref> The [[Treaty of Paris (1784)]], according to [[Fernand Braudel]], \"sounded the knell of Dutch greatness.\"<ref>[[Fernand Braudel|Braudel, Fernand]], ''The Perspective of the World'' vol.

The [[French Revolution]] resulted first in the establishment of a pro-French [[Batavian Republic]] (1795\u20131806), then the creation of the [[Kingdom of Holland]], ruled by a member of the [[House of Bonaparte]] (1806\u20131810), and finally annexation by the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] (1810\u20131813).\n\n===Patriot rebellion and its suppression (1785\u20131795)===\n{{main|Batavian Revolution}}\n[[File:Jonas Zeuner - Vuurgevecht aan de Vaartse Rijn.jpg|thumb|Firefight on the [[Vaartse Rijn]] at [[Jutphaas]] on 9 May 1787. The pro-revolutionary Utrecht [[Patriots (Dutch Republic)|Patriots]] are on the right; the troops of [[stadholder]] [[William V, Prince of Orange]] on the left. (Painted by Jonas Zeuner, 1787)]]\n\nInfluenced by the [[American Revolution]], the [[Patriots (Dutch Republic)|Patriots]] sought a more democratic form of government. The opening shot of this revolution is often considered to be the 1781 publication of a manifesto called ''[[Aan het Volk van Nederland]]'' (\"To the People of the Netherlands\") by [[Joan van der Capellen tot den Pol]], who would become an influential leader of the Patriot movement. Their aim was to reduce corruption and the power held by the [[stadtholder]], [[William V, Prince of Orange]].\n\nSupport for the Patriots came mostly from the middle class. They formed [[militia]]s called ''[[exercitiegenootschap]]pen''. In 1785, there was an open Patriot rebellion, which took the form of an armed insurrection by local militias in certain Dutch towns, ''Freedom'' being the rallying cry. [[Herman Willem Daendels]] attempted to organise an overthrow of various municipal governments ([[vroedschap]]). The goal was to oust government officials and force new elections. \"Seen as a whole this revolution was a string of violent and confused events, accidents, speeches, rumours, bitter enmities and armed confrontations\", wrote French historian [[Fernand Braudel]], who saw it as a forerunner of the [[French Revolution]].\n\nIn 1785 [[William V, Prince of Orange|the stadholder]] left The Hague and moved his court to [[Nijmegen]] in [[Guelders]], a city remote from the heart of Dutch political life. In June 1787, his energetic wife [[Wilhelmina of Prussia, Princess of Orange|Wilhelmina]] (the sister of [[Frederick William II of Prussia]]) tried to travel to [[The Hague]]. Outside [[Schoonhoven]], she was stopped by Patriot militiamen and taken to a farm near [[Goejanverwellesluis]]. Within two days she was forced to return to Nijmegen, an insult not unnoticed in Prussia.\n\nThe House of Orange reacted with severity, relying on [[Prussia]]n troops led by [[Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick]] and a small contingent of British troops to [[Prussian invasion of Holland|suppress the rebellion]]. Dutch banks at this time still held much of the world's [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. Government-sponsored banks owned up to 40% of Great Britain's [[national debt]] and there were close connections to the [[House of Stuart]]. The stadholder had supported British policies after the [[American Revolution]].\n\nThis severe military response overwhelmed the Patriots and put the stadholder firmly back in control. A small unpaid Prussian army was billeted in the Netherlands and supported themselves by looting and extortion. The exercitiegenootschappen continued urging citizens to resist the government. They distributed pamphlets, formed \"Patriot Clubs\" and held public [[Demonstration (people)|demonstration]]s. The government responded by pillaging those towns where opposition continued. Five leaders were sentenced to death (but fled first). Lynchings also occurred. For a while, no one dared appear in public without an orange cockade to show their support for [[Orangism (Netherlands)|Orangism]]. Many Patriots, perhaps around 40,000 in all, fled to Brabant, France (especially [[Dunkirk]] and [[Saint-Omer|St. Omer]]) and elsewhere. However, before long the French became involved in Dutch politics and the tide turned.\n\n===Batavian Republic (1795\u20131806)===\n{{Main|Batavian Republic}}\n[[File:Vrijheidsboom.jpg|left|thumb|Liberty tree erected in Dam Square in Amsterdam, 1795 by H. Numan.]]\nThe [[French Revolution]] was popular, and numerous underground clubs were promoting it when in January 1795 the [[Flanders Campaign|French army invaded]]. The underground rose up, overthrew the municipal and provincial governments, and proclaimed the [[Batavian Republic]] ({{lang-nl|Bataafse Republiek}}) [[Batavian Revolution in Amsterdam|in Amsterdam]]. Stadtholder William V fled to England and the States General dissolved itself. The new government was virtually a puppet of France.<ref>C. Cook & J. Stevenson, ''The routledge companion to European history since 1763'' (Abingdon: Routledge, 2005), p. 66; J. Dunn, ''Democracy: A history'' (NY: Atlantic Books, 2005), p. 86.</ref>  The Batavian Republic enjoyed widespread support and sent soldiers to fight in the French armies. The 1799 [[Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland]] was repulsed by Batavian\u2013French forces. Nevertheless, Napoleon replaced it because the regime of [[Grand Pensionary]] [[Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck]] (1805\u201306) was insufficiently docile.<ref>[[R.R. Palmer|Palmer, R.R.]] \"Much in Little: The Dutch Revolution of 1795,\" ''Journal of Modern History'' (1954) 26#1 pp. 15\u201335 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1874870 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nThe confederal structure of the old Dutch Republic was permanently replaced by a unitary state.  The 1798 constitution had a genuinely democratic character, though a coup d'\u00e9tat of 1801 put an authoritarian regime in power. Ministerial government was introduced for the first time in Dutch history and many of the current government departments date their history back to this period.  Meanwhile, the exiled stadholder [[Kew Letters|handed over the Dutch colonies]] in \"safekeeping\" to Great Britain and ordered the colonial governors to comply.  This permanently ended the colonial empire in Guyana, Ceylon and the Cape Colony. The Dutch East Indies was returned to the Netherlands under the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814]].\n\n===Kingdom of Holland to William I (1806\u20131815)===\n[[File:France L-2 (1812)-fr.svg|thumb|Administrative divisions of the [[First French Empire]] in 1812, illustrating the incorporation of the Netherlands and its internal reorganisation.]]\n{{Main|Kingdom of Holland}}\n\nIn 1806 Napoleon restyled the Netherlands (along with a small part of what is now Germany) into the [[Kingdom of Holland]], putting his brother [[Louis Bonaparte]] (1778\u20131846), on the throne. The new king was unpopular, but he was willing to cross his brother for the benefit of his new kingdom. Napoleon forced his abdication in 1810 and incorporated the Netherlands directly into the [[First French Empire|French empire]], imposing economic controls and conscription of all young men as soldiers. When the French retreated from the northern provinces in 1813, a [[Driemanschap|Triumvirate]] took over at the helm of a [[Sovereign Principality of the United Netherlands|provisional government]].  Although most members of the provisional government had been among the men who had driven out William V 18 years earlier, the leaders of the provisional government knew that any new regime would have to be headed by his son, William Frederick.  They also knew that it would be better in the long term if the Dutch people themselves installed the prince, rather than have him imposed on the country by the anti-French alliance.  Accordingly, the Triumvirate called William Frederick back on 30 November and offered him the crown.  He refused, but instead proclaimed himself \"[[Sovereign Principality of the United Netherlands|hereditary sovereign prince]]\" on 6 December.\n\nThe [[Great Powers]] had [[Eight Articles of London|secretly agreed]] to merge the northern Netherlands with the more populated [[Austrian Netherlands]] and the smaller [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge]] into a single constitutional monarchy.  Having a stronger country on France's northern border was considered (especially by [[Alexander I of Russia|Tsar Alexander]]) to be an important part of the strategy to keep France's power in check.  In 1814, William Frederick gained sovereignty over the Austrian Netherlands and Li\u00e8ge as well. Thus, William Frederick had fulfilled his family's three-century quest to unite the Low Countries under a single rule.\n\nOn 15 March 1815; with the encouragement of the powers gathered at the [[Congress of Vienna]], William Frederick raised the Netherlands to the status of a kingdom and proclaimed himself [[William I of the Netherlands|King William I]].  This was made official later in 1815, when the Low Countries were formally recognized as the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. The crown was made a hereditary office of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]].\n\n==United Kingdom of the Netherlands (1815\u20131839)==\n{{Main|United Kingdom of the Netherlands|Dutch monarchy}}\n[[File:LandingWillemI.jpg|thumb|left|''Landing of the future king [[William I of the Netherlands|William I]] at Scheveningen on 30 November 1813'' by Johan Willem Heyting (1915\u20131995).]]\n[[William I of the Netherlands|William I]] became king and also became the hereditary [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg]], that was part of the Netherlands but at the same time part of the German Confederation. The newly created country had two capitals: [[Amsterdam]] and [[Brussels]]. The new nation had two equal parts. The north (Netherlands proper) had 2 million people. They spoke chiefly Dutch but were divided religiously between a Protestant majority and a large Catholic minority. The south (which would be known as \"Belgium\" after 1830) had a population of 3.4&nbsp;million people. Nearly all were Catholic, but it was divided between French-speaking Walloons and Dutch-speaking Flemings. The upper and middle classes in the south were mostly French-speaking. About 60,000 Belgians were eligible to vote, compared to about 80,000 Dutchmen.  Officially Amsterdam was the capital, but in a compromise the government met alternately in Brussels and The Hague.<ref>Kossmann, ''Low Countries'' p 112\u201333</ref>\n\n[[Adolphe Quetelet]] (1796\u20131874), the great Belgian statistician, calculated that the new nation was significantly better off than other states. Mortality was low, the food supply was good, education was good, public awareness was high and the charity rate was the highest in the world. The best years were in the mid-1820s.<ref>Kossmann, ''Low Countries'' p 115\u201316</ref>\n\nThe quality of schooling was dismal, however. According to Schama, about 1800 the local school teacher was the \"humble auxiliary of the local priest. Despised by his co-villagers and forced to subsist on the gleanings of the peasants, he combined drumming the catechism into the heads of his unruly charges with the duties of winding the town clock, ringing the church bells or digging its graves. His principal use to the community was to keep its boys out of mischief when there was no labour for them in the fields, or setting the destitute orphans of the town to the 'useful arts' of picking tow or spinning crude flax. As one would expect, standards in such an occupation were dismal.\"<ref>Simon Schama, \"The Rights of Ignorance: Dutch Educational Policy in Belgium 1815\u201330,\" ''History of Education'' (1972) 1:1, pp. 81\u201389 [https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0046760720010106 link]</ref> But in 1806 the Dutch, led by Adriaan van den Ende, energetically set out to modernise education, focusing on a new system for advanced training of teachers with an elaborate system of inspectors, training courses, teacher examinations and teaching societies.  By 1826, although much smaller than France, the Dutch national government was spending 12 times more than Paris on education.<ref>Schama, \"The Rights of Ignorance: Dutch Educational Policy in Belgium 1815\u201330,\" pp. 84\u201385</ref>\n\n===Constitutional monarchy===\n[[File:Vereinigteskoenigreich.png|thumb|left|'''The [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]] and [[Duchy of Limburg (1839\u20131867)|Limburg]] in 1839'''<br>'''1''', '''2''' and '''3''' United Kingdom of the Netherlands (until 1830)<br>'''1''' and '''2''' [[Netherlands|Kingdom of the Netherlands]] (after 1830)<br>'''2''' [[Duchy of Limburg (1839\u20131867)]] (in the German Confederacy after 1839 as compensation for Waals-Luxemburg)<br>'''3''' and '''4''' [[Belgium|Kingdom of Belgium]] (after 1839)<br>'''4''' and '''5''' [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]] (borders until 1839) <br>'''4''' [[Luxembourg (province)|Province of Luxembourg]] (Waals-Luxemburg, to Belgium in 1839)<br>'''5''' [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]] (German Luxemburg; borders after 1839)<br>In blue, the borders of the [[German Confederation]].]]\n\nWilliam I, who reigned from 1815 to 1840, had great constitutional power. An [[enlightened despot]], he accepted the modernizing transformations of the previous 25 years, including equality of all before the law. However, he resurrected the [[Estates of the realm|estates]] as a political class and elevated a large number of people to the nobility. Voting rights were still limited, and only the nobility were eligible for seats in the upper house. The old provinces were reestablished in name only. The government was now fundamentally unitary, and all authority flowed from the center.\n\nWilliam I was a Calvinist and unsympathetic to the religious culture and practices of the Catholic majority.  He promulgated the \"Fundamental Law of Holland\", with some modifications. This entirely overthrew the old order of things in the southern Netherlands: it abolished the privileges of the Catholic Church, and guaranteed equal protection to every religious creed and the enjoyment of the same civil and political rights to every subject of the king. It reflected the spirit of the French Revolution and in so doing did not please the Catholic bishops in the south, who had detested the Revolution.<ref>Godefroid Kurth, \"Belgium\" in [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02395a.htm ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1907) online]</ref>\n\nWilliam I actively promoted economic modernization. The first 15 years of the Kingdom showed progress and prosperity, as industrialization proceeded rapidly in the south, where the [[Industrial Revolution]] allowed entrepreneurs and labor to combine in a new textile industry, powered by local coal mines. There was little industry in the northern provinces, but most overseas colonies were restored, and highly profitable trade resumed after a 25-year hiatus. Economic liberalism combined with moderate monarchical authoritarianism to accelerate the adaptation of the Netherlands to the new conditions of the 19th century. The country prospered until a crisis arose in relations with the southern provinces.\n\n===Belgium breaks away===\n{{main|Belgian Revolution}}\nWilliam was determined to create a united people, even though the north and south had drifted far apart in the past three centuries. Protestants were the largest denomination in the North (population 2 million), but formed a quarter of the population in the overwhelmingly Catholic South (population 3.5&nbsp;million). Nevertheless, Protestants dominated William's government and army. The Catholics did not consider themselves an integral part of the United Netherlands, preferring instead to identify with mediaeval Dutch culture. Other factors that contributed to this feeling were economic (the South was industrialising, the North had always been a merchants' nation) and linguistic (French was spoken in [[Wallonia]] and a large part of the bourgeoisie in Flemish cities).{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nAfter having been dominant for centuries, the French-speaking elite in the Southern Netherlands now felt like second-class citizens.\nIn the Catholic South,<ref>see [http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/lowcountries/neth18151830.html online maps 1830, 1839]</ref> William's policies were unpopular. The French-speaking Walloons strenuously rejected his attempt to make Dutch the universal language of government, while the population of [[Flanders]] was divided. Flemings in the south spoke a Dutch dialect (\"Flemish\") and welcomed the encouragement of Dutch with a revival of literature and popular culture. Other Flemings, notably the educated bourgeoisie, preferred to speak French. Although Catholics possessed legal equality, they resented their subordination to a government that was fundamentally Protestant in spirit and membership after having been the state church for centuries in the south. Few Catholics held high office in state or army. Furthermore, political liberals in the south complained about the king's authoritarian methods. All southerners complained of underrepresentation in the national legislature. Although the south was industrializing and was more prosperous than the north the accumulated grievances allowed the multiple opposition forces to coalesce. \n[[File:R\u00e9volution belge de 1830 - La rue de Flandre le jeudi 23 septembre 1830.jpg|thumb|Fighting between Belgian rebels and the Dutch military expedition in [[Brussels]] in September 1830]]\nThe outbreak of [[July Revolution|revolution in France]] in 1830 was a signal for action, at first on behalf of autonomy for Belgium, as the southern provinces were now called, and later on behalf of total independence. William dithered and his half-hearted efforts to reconquer Belgium were thwarted both by the efforts of the Belgians themselves and by the diplomatic opposition of the great powers.\n\nAt the [[London Conference of 1830]], the chief powers of Europe ordered (in November 1830) an armistice between the Dutch and the Belgians. The first draft for a treaty of separation of Belgium and the Netherlands was rejected by the Belgians. A second draft (June 1831) was rejected by William I, who resumed hostilities. Franco-British intervention forced William to withdraw Dutch forces from Belgium late in 1831, and in 1833 an armistice of indefinite duration was concluded. Belgium was effectively independent but William's attempts to recover Luxembourg and Limburg led to renewed tension. The London Conference of 1838\u201339 prepared the final Dutch-Belgian [[Treaty of London (1839)|separation treaty of 1839]]. It divided Luxembourg and Limburg between the Dutch and Belgian crowns. The Kingdom of the Netherlands thereafter was made up of the 11 northern provinces.<ref>{{cite book|first = J. C.

Griffiths argues that certain government policies facilitated the emergence of a national economy in the 19th century. They included the abolition of internal tariffs and guilds, a unified coinage system, modern methods of tax collection, standardized weights and measures, and the building of many roads, canals, and railroads.  However, compared to Belgium, which was leading in industrialization on the Continent, the Netherlands moved slowly. Possible explanations for this difference are the higher costs due to geography and high wages, and the emphasis of entrepreneurs on trade rather than industry.<ref>Richard T. Griffiths, ''Industrial Retardation in the Netherlands, 1830\u20131850'' (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1979).</ref>\nFor example, in the Dutch coastal provinces agricultural productivity was relatively high. Hence, industrial growth arrived relatively late \u2013 after 1860 \u2013 because incentives to move to labour-intensive industry were quite weak.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

The number of people employed in agriculture decreased, while the country made a strong effort to revive its stake in the highly competitive shipping and trade business. The Netherlands lagged behind Belgium until the late 19th century in industrialization, and caught up around 1920. Major industries included textiles and (later) the great Philips industrial conglomerate. Rotterdam became a major shipping and manufacturing center.<ref>{{cite book|author=Loyen, Reginald|title=Struggling for Leadership: Antwerp-Rotterdam Port.

Born in [[Zundert|Groot-Zundert]], van Gogh was a Dutch post-Impressionist painter whose work, notable for its rough beauty, emotional honesty and bold color, had a far-reaching influence on [[20th-century art]].]]\n\nIn 1840 William I abdicated in favor of his son, [[William II of the Netherlands|William II]], who attempted to carry on the policies of his father in the face of a powerful liberal movement. In 1848 [[Revolutions of 1848|unrest broke out all over Europe]]. Although there were no major events in the Netherlands, these foreign developments persuaded King [[William II of the Netherlands|William II]] to agree to liberal and democratic reform. That same year [[Johan Rudolf Thorbecke]], a prominent liberal, was asked by the king to draft a constitution that would turn the Netherlands into a [[constitutional monarchy]]. The new constitution was proclaimed on 3 November 1848. It severely limited the king's powers (making the government accountable only to an elected parliament), and it protected [[civil liberties]]. The new liberal constitution, which put the government under the control of the States General, was accepted by the legislature in 1848.  The relationship between monarch, government and parliament has remained essentially unchanged ever since.\n\nWilliam II was succeeded by [[William III of the Netherlands|William III]] in 1849. The new king reluctantly chose Thorbecke to head the new government, which introduced several liberal measures, notably the extension of suffrage. However, Thorbecke's government soon fell, when Protestants rioted against the Vatican's reestablishment of the Catholic episcopate, in abeyance since the 16th century. A conservative government was formed, but it did not undo the liberal measures, and the Catholics were finally given equality after two centuries of subordination. Dutch political history from the middle of the 19th century until the [[First World War]] was fundamentally one of the extension of liberal reforms in government, the reorganization and modernization of the Dutch economy, and the rise of trade unionism and socialism as working-class movements independent of traditional liberalism.  The growth in prosperity was enormous, as real per capita GNP soared from 106 guilders in 1804 to 403 in 1913.<ref>E. H.

In 1816, the government took full control of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] (''Nederlands Hervormde Kerk''). In 1857, all religious instruction was ended in public schools, but the various churches set up their own schools, and even universities. Dissident members broke away from the Dutch Reformed Church in the Secession of 1834. They were harassed by the government under an onerous Napoleonic law prohibiting gatherings of more than 20 members without a permit. After the harassment ended in the 1850s, a number of these dissidents eventually created the Christian Reformed Church in 1869; thousands migrated to Michigan, Illinois, and Iowa in the United States. By 1900, the dissidents represented about 10% of the population, compared to 45% of the population who were in the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], which continued to be the only church to receive state money.<ref>Corwin, \"Holland\" [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/encyc05.h.ix.html  ''The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge,'' (1914) 5:319\u201322]</ref>\n\nAt mid-century, most Dutch belonged either to the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] or dissenter groups that separated from it (around 55%), or the [[Roman Catholic Church]] (35% to 40%), together with smaller [[Protestant]] (for example, [[Lutheran]]) and Jewish groups. A large and powerful sector of nominal Protestants were in fact secular liberals seeking to minimize religious influence. In reaction a novel alliance developed with Catholics and devout Calvinists joining against secular liberals. The Catholics, who had been loosely allied with the liberals in earlier decades, turned against them on the issue of state support, which the liberals insisted should be granted only to public schools, and joined with Protestant political parties in demanding equal state support to schools maintained by religious groups.<ref>J. C. H. Blom and E. Lamberts, eds. ''History of the Low Countries'' (1999) pp. 387\u2013403</ref>\n\nThe Netherlands remained one of the most tolerant countries in Europe towards religious belief, although conservative Protestants objected to the liberalization of the Dutch Reformed Church during the 19th century and faced opposition from the government when they tried to establish separate communities (Catholics and other non-Protestants were left unmolested by Dutch authorities). Some moved to the United States as a consequence, but as the century drew to a close, religious persecution had totally ceased.\n\n[[File:Old-Amsterdam 1891-street-1.jpg|thumb|Street in Amsterdam in 1891 ({{Interlanguage link multi|Vijzelstraat|nl}} looking towards Muntplein).]]\nDutch social and political life became divided by fairly clear-cut internal borders that were emerging as the society pillarized into three separate parts based on religion.  The economy was not affected. One of the people most responsible for designing pillarization was [[Abraham Kuyper]] (1837\u20131920), a leading politician, [[neo-Calvinist]] theologian, and journalist. Kuyper established orthodox Calvinist organizations, and also provided a theoretical framework by developing such concepts as \"sphere-sovereignty\" that celebrated Dutch society as a society of organized minorities. ''Verzuiling'' (\"pillarization\" or \"pluralism\") after 1850 became the solution to the danger of internal conflict. Everyone was part of one (and only one) pillar (''zuil'') based chiefly on religion (Protestant, Catholic, secular). The secular pillar eventually split into a socialist/working class pillar and a liberal (pro-business) secular pillar. Each pillar built a full set of its own social organizations, including churches (for the religious pillars), political parties, schools, universities,<ref>The oldest universities, in Leiden, Utrecht, and Groningen, had a secular-liberal character. In 1880 Kuyper opened a Protestant university in Amsterdam and in 1923 a Catholic one opened in Nijmegen. The Amsterdam municipal university, which opened in 1877, leaned toward secular-socialism, but was formally neutral.</ref> labor unions, sport clubs, boy scout unions and other youth clubs, and newspapers.

The [[Hague School]] brought a revival of realist painting, 1860\u20131890.

''The Age of Van Gogh: Dutch Painting 1880\u20131895'' (1997)</ref>  Literature, music, architecture and science also flourished. A representative leader of science was [[Johannes Diderik van der Waals]] (1837\u20131923), a working class youth who taught himself physics, earned a PhD at the nation's leading school Leiden University, and in 1910 won the Nobel Prize for his discoveries in thermodynamics. [[Hendrik Lorentz]] (1853\u20131928) and his student [[Pieter Zeeman]] (1865\u20131943) shared the 1902 Nobel Prize in physics.

She would rule the Netherlands for 58 years. On her accession to the throne, the [[personal union]] between the Netherlands and Luxembourg ended because Luxembourg law excluded women from rule. Her remote cousin [[Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Adolphe]] became the Grand Duke of Luxembourg.\n\nThis was a time of further growth and colonial development, but it was marked by the difficulties of the [[World War I]] (in which the Netherlands was neutral) \nand the [[Great Depression]]. The Dutch population grew rapidly in the 20th century, as death rates fell, more lands were opened up, and industrialisation created urban jobs.<ref>Michael Wintle, ''An Economic and Social History of the Netherlands, 1800\u20131920: Demographic, Economic, and Social Transition'' (2000) p. 342</ref> Between 1900 and 1950 the population doubled from 5.1 to 10 million people.<ref name=\"CBS Statline - Population; history\">[http://statline.cbs.nl/StatWeb/publication/?DM=SLEN&PA=37556ENG&D1=0-44,53-60&D2=1,11,21,31,41,51,61,71,81,91,101&LA=EN&VW=T CBS Statline \u2013 Population; history].

It was smaller in 1945 than in 1815 because the Netherlands was the only colonial power that did not expand into Africa or anywhere else.  The empire was run from Batavia (in Java), where the governor and his technical experts had almost complete authority with little oversight from the Hague. Successive governors improved their bureaucratic and military controls, and allowed very little voice to the locals until the 1920s.<ref>Jean Gelman Taylor, ''The Social World of Batavia: Europeans and Eurasians in Colonial Indonesia'' (1983)</ref>\n\nThe colony brought economic opportunity to the mother country and there was little concern at the time about it. One exception came in 1860 when Eduard Dekker, under the pen name \"[[Multatuli]]\" wrote the novel ''[[Max Havelaar: Or the Coffee Auctions of the Dutch Trading Company]]'', one of the most notable books in the history of [[Dutch literature]]. He criticized the exploitation of the colony and as well had harsh words about the indigenous princes who collaborated with the governor. The book helped inspire the Indonesian independence movement in the mid-20th century as well as the \"[[Fair trade]]\" movement for coffee at the end of the century.<ref>{{cite book|author=Antony Wild|title=Coffee: A Dark History|url=https://archive.org/details/coffeedarkhistor0000wild|url-access=registration|year=2005|publisher=W.

As the map shows, the Dutch slowly expanded their holdings from their base in Java to include all of modern Indonesia by 1920. Most islands were not a problem but there was a long, costly campaign against the [[Aceh Sultanate|Achin (Aceh)]] state in northern Sumatra.\n\nThe Netherlands had not fought a major military campaign since the 1760s, and the strength of its armed forces had gradually dwindled. The Dutch decided not to ally themselves with anyone, and kept out of all European wars especially the First World War that swirled about it.<ref name = \"hvhqei\">Maartje M.

It supplied many essential raw materials to Germany such as rubber, tin, quinine, oil and food. The British used its blockade to limit supplies that the Dutch could pass on.<ref name = \"hvhqei\"/> There were other factors that made it expedient for both the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] and the [[Central Powers]] for the Netherlands to remain neutral. The Netherlands controlled the mouths of the [[Scheldt]], the [[Rhine]] and the [[Meuse River]]s. Germany had an interest in the Rhine since it ran through the industrial areas of the [[Ruhr]] and connected it with the Dutch port of Rotterdam. Britain had an interest in the Scheldt River and the Meuse flowed from France. All countries had an interest in keeping the others out of the Netherlands so that no one's interests could be taken away or be changed. If one country were to have invaded the Netherlands, another would certainly have counterattacked to defend their own interest in the rivers. It was too big a risk for any of the belligerent nations and none wanted to risk fighting on another front.<ref name = \"hvhqei\"/>\n\n[[File:Afsluitdijk 01.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Afsluitdijk]], the dike closing off the [[Zuiderzee]], was constructed between 1927 and 1933. Public works projects like this were one way to deal with high unemployment during the [[Great Depression]].]]\nThe Dutch were affected by the war, troops were mobilized and conscription was introduced in the face of harsh criticism from opposition parties. In 1918, mutinies broke out in the military. Food shortages were extensive, due to the control the belligerents exercised over the Dutch. Each wanted their share of Dutch produce. As a result, the price of potatoes rose sharply because Britain had demanded so much from the Dutch. Food riots even broke out in the country.<ref name = \"hvhqei\"/> A big problem was smuggling. When Germany had conquered Belgium, the Allies saw it as enemy territory and stopped exporting to Belgium. Food became scarce for the Belgian people, since the Germans seized all food. This gave the Dutch the opportunity to start to smuggle. This, however, caused great problems in the Netherlands, including inflation and further food shortages. The Allies demanded that the Dutch stop the smuggling, and the government took measures to remain neutral. The government placed many cities under 'state of siege'. On 8 January 1916, a {{convert|5|km|mi|adj=on}} zone was created by the government along the border. In that zone, goods could be moved on main roads with a permit.<ref name = \"hvhqei\"/> German authorities in Belgium had an electrified fence erected all along the Belgian\u2013Dutch border that caused many refugees from Belgium to lose their lives.  The fence was guarded by older German Landsturm soldiers.<ref>{{cite web|title=De Dodendraad \u2013 Wereldoorlog I|url=http://www.bunkergordel.be/14.023%20De%20Dodendraad.htm|publisher=Bunkergordel.be|accessdate=19 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Interwar period ===\n{{Main|Great Depression in the Netherlands}}\nAlthough both houses of the Dutch Parliament were elected by the people, only men with high incomes were eligible to vote until 1917, when pressure from socialist movements resulted in elections in which all men regardless of income, were entitled to vote. In 1919, women also obtained the right to vote for the first time in history.\n\nThe worldwide [[Great Depression]] which began after the tumultuous events of [[Black Tuesday]] in 1929, that continued into the early-1930s had crippling effects on the Dutch economy; lasting longer than in most other European countries. The long duration of the Great Depression in the Netherlands is often explained by the very strict fiscal policy of the Dutch government at the time, and its decision to adhere to the [[gold standard]] for much longer than most of its trading partners. The Great Depression led to high unemployment and widespread poverty, as well as increasing social unrest.\n\nThe rise of [[Nazism]] in Germany did not go unnoticed in the Netherlands, and there was growing concern at the possibility of armed conflict, but most Dutch people expected that Germany would again respect Dutch neutrality.\n\nThere were separate fascist and Nazi movements in the 1930s. Dutch Fascists admired Mussolini's Italy and called for a traditional corporate ideology. The membership was small, elitist and ineffective. The pro-Nazi movement, however, won support from [[Berlin]] and attempted to build a mass base by 1935. It failed because most Dutch rejected its racial ideology and calls for violence.<ref>Erik Hansen, \"Fascism and Nazism in the Netherlands 1929\u201339,\" ''European Studies Review'' (1981) 11#3 pp. 355\u201385.

The budget was further increased in 1938 (after the [[Anschluss|annexation of Austria]] and occupation of the Czech [[Sudetenland]]). The colonial government also increased its military budget because of increasing tensions with Japan. The Dutch did not mobilise their armed forces until shortly before France and the UK declared war on Germany in September 1939 after the invasion of Poland. Neutrality was still the official policy, but the Dutch government tried to buy new arms for their badly equipped forces; however, a considerable share of ordered weapons never arrived.\n\n==The Second World War (1939\u20131945)==\n{{Main|History of the Netherlands (1939\u20131945)}}\n\n===Nazi invasion and occupation===\n{{Main|Battle of the Netherlands|Rotterdam Blitz|Dutch resistance}}\n[[File:Rotterdam, Laurenskerk, na bombardement van mei 1940.jpg|thumb|Rotterdam was destroyed by German bombers on 14 May 1940. 814 people died in the [[Rotterdam Blitz]].]]\n\nAt the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the Netherlands once again declared its [[neutral country|neutrality]]. However, on 10 May 1940, [[Nazi Germany]] launched an attack on the Netherlands and Belgium and quickly overran most of the two countries. Fighting against the Dutch army proved to be more of a burden than foreseen; the northern attack was stopped dead, the one in the middle came to a grinding halt near the Grebbeberg and many airborne assault troops were killed and taken prisoner in the west of the country.\nOnly in the south were defences broken, but the one passage over the River Maas at Rotterdam was held by the Dutch. By 14 May, fighting in many locations had ceased and the German army could make little or no headway, so the [[Luftwaffe]] bombed [[Rotterdam]], the second-largest city of the Netherlands, killing about 900 people, destroying most of the inner city and leaving 78,000 people homeless.\n\nFollowing the bombing and German threats of the same treatment for [[Utrecht]], the Netherlands capitulated on 15 May, except for the province of [[Zeeland]] where French and French-Moroccan troops stood side-by-side with the Dutch army. Still, the Dutch Royal Family along with some armed forces fled to the United Kingdom. Some members of the Dutch Royal Family eventually moved to [[Ottawa]], Ontario, Canada until the Netherlands was liberated five years later.  [[Princess Margriet of the Netherlands|Princess Margriet]] was born in Canada, during the period the family spent in exile.\n\nResentment of the Germans grew as the occupation became more harsh, prompting many Dutch in the latter years of the war to join the [[Dutch resistance|resistance]]. But collaboration was not uncommon either; many thousands of young Dutch males volunteered for combat service on the Russian Front with the [[Waffen-SS]] and many companies worked for the German occupiers.\n\n===Holocaust in the Netherlands===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Exhibit of the Anne Frank Zentrum.jpg\n| width1 = 200\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = Yellow [[Star of David]] with ''Jood'', the Dutch word for \"[[Jew]]\".\n| image2 = WWII netherlands persoonsbewijs.jpg\n| width2 = 165\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = [[Identification papers]] issued to Dutch people during the war.\n| footer = \n}}\nAbout 140,000 Jews lived in the Netherlands at the beginning of the war.

Dutch citizens and everybody with Dutch ancestry, the so-called \"[[Indo people|Indo's]]\" were captured and put to work in labour camps or interned. As in the Netherlands, many Dutch ships, planes and military personnel managed to reach safety, in this case Australia; from where they were able to fight again.\n\n===False hopes, the Hunger Winter and Liberation===\nIn Europe, after the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] landed in [[Normandy]] in June 1944, progress was slow until the [[Invasion of Normandy|Battle of Normandy]] ended in August 1944. German resistance collapsed in Western Europe and the allied armies advanced quickly towards the Dutch border. The [[First Canadian Army]] and the Second British Army conducted operations on Dutch soil from September onwards. On 17 September, a daring operation, [[Operation Market Garden]]; was executed with the goal of capturing bridges across three major rivers in the southern Netherlands. Despite desperate fighting by American, British and Polish forces, the bridge at [[Arnhem]], across the Neder Rijn, could not be captured.\n\nAreas south of the Rhine river were liberated in the period September\u2013December 1944, including the province of Zeeland, which was liberated in October and November in the [[Battle of the Scheldt]]. This opened [[Antwerp]] to allied shipping. The [[First Canadian Army]] held a static line along the [[river Meuse]] (Maas) from December 1944 through February 1945.\n\nThe rest of the country remained occupied until the spring of 1945. In the face of Dutch defiance, the Nazis deliberately cut off food supplies resulting in near-starvation in the cities during the ''[[Hongerwinter]]'' ([[Hunger winter]]) of 1944\u201345.

A baby boom followed the war, as young Dutch couples started the families they couldn't previously due to the war. They had lived through the hardships of the Great Depression and the hell of war. They wanted to start afresh and live better lives without the poverty, starvation, terror, and extreme frugality they knew so well. They had little taste for a strictly imposed rule-oriented traditional system with its rigid hierarchies, sharp pillarised boundaries and strictly orthodox religious doctrines. The translation of ''The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care'' (1946), by American pediatrician [[Benjamin Spock]] was a best-seller.

Dutch corporations, particularly [[Royal Dutch Shell]] and [[Philips]], became internationally prominent.

The Netherlands also experienced years of negative growth after that. Unemployment increased steadily, causing rapid growth in social-security expenditures. Inflation reached double digits; government surpluses disappeared. On the positive side, rich natural gas resources were developed, providing a current account trade surplus during most of the period.

More than 1,800 people drowned in the ensuing inundation.\n\nThe Dutch government subsequently decided on a large-scale programme of public works (the \"[[Deltawerken|Delta Works]]\") to protect the country against future floods. The project took more than thirty years to complete. The Oosterscheldedam, an advanced sea storm barrier, became operational in 1986.

Its purpose was to pool the steel and coal resources of the member states, and to support the economies of the participating countries. As a side effect, the ECSC helped defuse tensions between countries which had recently been fighting each other during the war. In time, this economic merger grew, adding members and broadening in scope, to become the [[European Economic Community]], and later the [[European Union]] (EU).\n[[File:Anti kernwapendemonstratie in Den Haag ( 550 duizend deelnemers ) overzichten m, Bestanddeelnr 253-8817.jpg|thumb|Protest in The Hague against the [[nuclear arms race]] between the U.S./NATO and the Warsaw Pact, 1983]]\nThe United States started to have more influence.

The UK mediated a compromise signed in March 1947 whereby de facto control of the new [[Indonesian Republic]] was acknowledged over Java, Maduro and Sumatra, while acknowledging Dutch control over the numerous smaller and far less important islands. Supposedly there would be a federated Indonesian state and a union with the Netherlands, but that never happened. The Indonesians wanted complete transfer of power, and the Dutch refused. By 1946, the United States was financing the Dutch in Indonesia, and was able to exert pressure on The Hague.  Increasing international pressure\u2014including American hints about cutting off military funds\u2014forced the Netherlands to withdraw. A decisive episode was the success of the Indonesian Republic in crushing a Communist revolt.

In fact, the demand for labour was so strong that immigration was actively encouraged, first from Italy and Spain then later on, in larger numbers, from [[Turkey]] and [[Morocco]].\n\n[[Suriname]] became independent on 25 November 1975.

During the Purple Coalition years, a period lasting until the rise of the populist politician [[Pim Fortuyn]], the government addressed issues previously viewed as taboo under the Christian-influenced cabinet.

Abortion and [[euthanasia]] were decriminalised, but stricter guidelines were set for their implementation. Drug policy, especially with regard to the regulation of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], was reformed.

In 3500 pages he crafted a literary masterpiece that was translated into numerous languages; his dramatic story reached a wide audience in the 19th century. Motley relied heavily on Dutch scholarship and immersed himself in the sources. His style no longer attracts readers, and scholars have moved away from his simplistic dichotomies of good versus evil, Dutch versus Spanish, Catholic versus Protestant, freedom versus authoritarianism. His theory of causation over-emphasized ethnicity as an unchanging characteristic, exaggerated the importance of William of Orange, and gave undue importance to the issue religious tolerance.<ref>Robert Wheaton, \"Motley and the Dutch Historians,\" ''New England Quarterly'' (1962) 35#3 pp. 318\u201336 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/363823 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nThe pioneering Dutch cultural historian [[Johan Huizinga]] (1872\u20131945), author of ''The Autumn of the Middle Ages'' (1919) (the English translation was called ''The Waning of the Middle Ages'') and ''Homo Ludens: A Study of the Play Element in Culture'' (1935), which expanded the field of cultural history and influenced the historical anthropology of younger historians of the French [[Annales School]]. He was influenced by art history and advised historians to trace \"patterns of culture\" by studying \"themes, figures, motifs, symbols, styles and sentiments.\"<ref>Peter Burke, \"Historians and Their Times: Huizinga, Prophet of 'Blood and Roses.'\" ''History Today'' (Nov 1986) (36): 23\u201328; William U.

Cruz (2007) explains the major debates among scholars regarding the Dutch bid for independence from Spanish rule. While agreeing that the intellectual milieus of late 19th and 20th centuries affected historians' interpretations, Cruz argues that writings about the revolt trace changing perceptions of the role played by small countries in the history of Europe.  In recent decades grand theory has fallen out of favor among most scholars, who emphasize the particular over the general. Dutch and Belgian historiography since 1945 no longer says the revolt was the culmination of an inevitable process leading to independence and freedom. Instead scholars have put the political and economic details of the towns and provinces under the microscope, while agreeing on the weaknesses of attempts at centralization by the Habsburg rulers. The most influential new studies have been rooted in demographic and economic history, though scholars continue to debate the relationship between economics and politics. The religious dimension has been viewed in terms of mentalities, exposing the minority position of Calvinism, while the international aspects have been studied more seriously by foreign historians than by the Dutch themselves.<ref>Laura Cruz, \"The 80 Years' Question: the Dutch Revolt in Historical Perspective.\"  ''History Compass'' 2007 5(3): 914\u201334.</ref>\n\n[[Pieter Geyl]] was the leading historian of the Dutch Revolt, and a highly influential professor at the University of London (1919\u20131935) and at the State University of Utrecht (1936\u201358). He wrote a six-volume history of the Dutch-speaking peoples.<ref>Three volumes appeared in English translation, ''The Revolit of the Netherlands (1555\u20131609)'' (1932); and ''The Netherlands in the Seventeenth Century'' (2 vol 1936, 1964).</ref> The Nazis imprisoned him in World War II. In his political views, Geyl adopted the views of the 17th-century Dutch Louvestein faction, led by Johan van Oldenbarneveldt (1547\u20131619) and Johan de Witt (1625\u201372). It stood for liberty, toleration, and national interests in contrast to the Orange stadholders who sought to promote their own self-interest. According to Geyl, the Dutch Republic reached the peak of its powers during the 17th century. He was also a staunch nationalist and suggested that Flanders could split off from Belgium and join the Netherlands. Later he decried what he called radical nationalism and stressed more the vitality of Western Civilization. Geyl was highly critical of the [[world history]] approach of [[Arnold J. Toynbee]].<ref>Herbert H. Rowen, \"The Historical Work of Pieter Geyl.\" ''Journal of Modern History'' 1965 37(1): 35\u201349. {{ISSN|0022-2801}} [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1874563 in Jstor]</ref>\n\n[[Jan Romein]] (1893\u20131962) created a \"theoretical history\" in an attempt to reestablish the relevance of history to public life in the 1930s at a time of immense political uncertainty and cultural crisis, when Romein thought that history had become too inward-looking and isolated from other disciplines. Romein, a Marxist, wanted history to contribute to social improvement. At the same time, influenced by the successes of theoretical physics and his study of [[Oswald Spengler]], [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], [[Frederick John Teggart]], and others, he spurred on the development of theoretical history in the Netherlands, to the point where it became a subject in its own right at the university level after the war. Romein used the term integral history as a substitute for cultural history and focused his attention on the period around the turn of the century. He concluded that a serious crisis occurred in European civilization in 1900 because of the rise of anti-Semitism, extreme nationalism, discontent with the parliamentary system, depersonalization of the state, and the rejection of positivism. European civilization waned as the result of this crisis which was accompanied by the rise of the United States, the Americanization of the world, and the emergence of Asia. His interpretation is reminiscent of that of his mentor Johan Huizinga and was criticized by his colleague Pieter Geyl.<ref>A. C.

Records begin with the four centuries during which the region formed a militarized border zone of the [[Romans in the Netherlands|Roman]] Empire. This came under increasing pressure from [[Germanic peoples]] moving westwards. As Roman power collapsed and the [[Middle Ages]] began, three dominant [[Germanic peoples]] coalesced in the area, [[Frisians]] in the north and coastal areas, [[Dutch Low Saxon|Low Saxons]] in the northeast, and the [[Franks]] in the south.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the descendants of the [[Carolingian]] dynasty came to dominate the area and then extended their rule to a large part of Western Europe. The region of the [[Netherlands]] therefore became part of [[Lower Lotharingia]] within the Frankish [[Holy Roman Empire]]. For several centuries, lordships such as [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], [[County of Holland|Holland]], [[Zeeland]], [[Friesland]], [[Guelders]] and others held a changing patchwork of territories. There was no unified equivalent of the modern Netherlands.\n\nBy 1433, the [[Philip the Good|Duke of Burgundy]] had assumed control over most of the lowlands territories in Lower Lotharingia; he created the [[Burgundian Netherlands]] which included modern Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and a part of France.\n\nThe Catholic kings of Spain took strong measures against Protestantism, which polarised the peoples of present-day Belgium and the Netherlands. The subsequent [[Dutch revolt]] led to splitting the Burgundian Netherlands into a Catholic French and Dutch-speaking \"[[Spanish Netherlands]]\" (approximately corresponding to modern Belgium and Luxembourg), and a northern \"[[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]]\", which spoke Dutch and were predominantly Protestant with a Catholic minority. It became the modern Netherlands.\n\nIn the [[Dutch Golden Age]], which had its zenith around 1667, there was a flowering of trade, industry, the arts and the [[List of people from the Dutch Golden Age#Science|sciences]]. A rich worldwide [[Dutch empire]] developed and the [[Dutch East India Company]] became one of the earliest and most important of national mercantile companies based on entrepreneurship and trade.\n\nDuring the eighteenth century, the power, wealth and influence of the Netherlands declined. A series of wars with the more powerful [[Anglo-Dutch Wars|British]] and [[Franco-Dutch War|French]] neighbours weakened it. The UK seized the North American colony of [[New Amsterdam]], and renamed it \"New York\". There was growing unrest and [[Second Stadtholderless Period#Crisis and the Orangist revolution of 1747|conflict]] between the [[Orangism (Netherlands)|Orangists]] and the [[Patriottentijd|Patriots]]. The French Revolution spilled over after 1789, and a pro-French [[Batavian Republic]] was established in 1795\u20131806. Napoleon made it a satellite state, the [[Kingdom of Holland]] (1806\u20131810), and later simply a French imperial province.\n\nAfter the collapse of Napoleon in 1813\u201315, an expanded \"[[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]]\" was created with the [[House of Orange-Nassau|House of Orange]] as monarchs, also ruling Belgium and Luxembourg. The King imposed unpopular Protestant reforms on Belgium, [[Belgian Revolution|which revolted in 1830]] and became independent in 1839. After an initially conservative period, following the introduction of the 1848 constitution; the country became a [[parliamentary democracy]] with a [[constitutional monarch]]. Modern-day Luxembourg became officially independent from the Netherlands in 1839, but a personal union remained until 1890. Since 1890, it is ruled by another branch of the House of Nassau.\n\nThe Netherlands was neutral during the [[First World War]], but during the [[Second World War]], it was invaded and occupied by [[Nazi Germany]]. The Nazis, including many collaborators, rounded up and killed almost all of the country's Jewish population. When the Dutch resistance increased, the Nazis cut off food supplies to much of the country, causing severe starvation in 1944\u201345. In 1942, the Dutch East Indies were conquered by Japan, but prior to this the Dutch destroyed the oil wells for which Japan was desperate. [[Indonesia]] proclaimed its independence from the Netherlands in 1945, followed by [[Suriname]] in 1975. The post-war years saw rapid economic recovery (helped by the American [[Marshall Plan]]), followed by the introduction of a [[welfare state]] during an era of peace and prosperity. The Netherlands formed a new economic alliance with Belgium and Luxembourg, the [[Benelux]], and all three became founding members of the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]]. In recent decades, the Dutch economy has been closely linked to that of Germany and is highly prosperous. The four countries adopted the Euro on 1 January 2002, along with eight other EU member states.\n\n{{History Benelux states}}\n\n== Prehistory (before 800 BC) ==\n\n===Historical changes to the landscape===\nThe prehistory of the area that is now the Netherlands was largely shaped by its constantly shifting, low-lying geography.\n{|cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" style=\"background: white\"\n|-\n|[[File:5500vc ex leg.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Netherlands in 5500 BC]]\n|[[File:3850vc ex leg copy.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Netherlands in 3850 BC]]\n|[[File:2750vc ex leg copy.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Netherlands in 2750 BC]]\n|-\n|[[File:500vc ex leg copy.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Netherlands in 500 BC]]\n|[[File:50nc ex leg copy.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Netherlands in AD 50]]\n|{{legend|#fff15d|beach ridges and dunes}}\n{{legend|#d2d500|tidal sand flats, tidal [[mudflat]]s, [[salt marsh]]es}}\n{{legend|#b56c03|peat marshes and [[floodplain]] silt areas<br>(including old river courses and riverbank breaches which have filled up with [[silt]] or [[peat]])}}\n{{legend|#a1aa95|Valleys of the major rivers (not covered with peat)}}\n{{legend|#fec901|River dunes ([[Pleistocene]] dunes)}}\n{{legend|#e3f4fc|open water (sea, lagoons, rivers)}}\n{{legend|#f1f6e2|Pleistocene landscape (> \u22126 m compared to [[Normaal Amsterdams Peil|NAP]])}}\n{{legend|#fffdee|Pleistocene landscape (\u22126 to 0 m; \u201320 to 0 ft)}}\n{{legend|#fff9c2|Pleistocene landscape (0\u201310 m; 0\u201333 ft)}}\n{{legend|#ffeba6|Pleistocene landscape (10\u201320 m; 33\u201366 ft)}}\n{{legend|#fec901|Pleistocene landscape (20\u201350 m; 66\u2013164 ft)}}\n{{legend|#e7a300|Pleistocene landscape (50\u2013100 m; 164\u2013328 ft)}}\n{{legend|#da600d|Pleistocene landscape (100\u2013200 m; 328\u2013656 ft)}}\n|}\n\n===Earliest groups of hunter-gatherers (before 5000 BC)===\n[[File:Mannetje van Willemstad.jpg|thumb|180px|An oak figurine found in Willemstad, the Netherlands, dating from around 4500 BC.

Another group residing elsewhere is known to have made canoes.

Agriculture was practiced only on the [[loess]] [[plateau]] in the very south (southern [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]]), but even there it was not established permanently. Farms did not develop in the rest of the Netherlands.\n\nThere is also some evidence of small settlements in the rest of the country. These people made the switch to [[animal husbandry]] sometime between 4800 BC and 4500 BC.

In this period of Dutch prehistory, the first notable remains were erected: the [[dolmens]], large stone grave monuments. They are found in [[Drenthe]], and were probably built between 4100 BC and 3200 BC.\n\nTo the west, the [[Vlaardingen culture]] (around 2600 BC), an apparently more primitive culture of hunter-gatherers survived well into the [[Neolithic]] period.\n\n===Corded Ware and Bell Beaker cultures (around 3000\u20132000 BC)===\nAround 2950 BCE there was a transition from the [[Funnelbeaker]] farming culture to the [[Corded Ware]] pastoralist culture, a large archeological horizon appearing in western and central Europe, that is associated with the advance of Indo-European languages. This transition was probably caused by developments{{clarify|date=April 2016}} in eastern Germany, and it occurred within two generations.<ref name=Bloemers>{{Full citation needed|date=November 2012}}, {{Page needed|date=October 2011}}, in J.H.F.

Adams (Eds), ''The Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture'', Fitzroy Dearborn, 1997.</ref>\n\nThe Corded Ware and Bell Beaker cultures were not indigenous to the Netherlands but were pan-European in nature, extending across much of northern and central Europe.\n\nThe first evidence of the use of the wheel dates from this period, about 2400 BC. This culture also experimented with working with copper. Evidence of this, including stone anvils, copper knives, and a copper spearhead, was found on the [[Veluwe]]. Copper finds show that there was trade with other areas in Europe, as natural copper is not found in Dutch soil.\n\n===Bronze Age (around 2000\u2013800 BC)===\n[[File:Zwaard van Jutphaas.jpg|thumb|right|80px|A bronze ceremonial object (not a sword, but called the \"Sword of Jutphaas\"), dating from 1800 to 1500 BC and found south of [[Utrecht]].]]\n\nThe [[Bronze Age]] probably started somewhere around 2000 BC and lasted until around 800 BC. The earliest [[bronze]] tools have been found in the grave of a Bronze Age individual called \"the smith of [[Wageningen]]\". More Bronze Age objects from later periods have been found in [[Epe, Netherlands|Epe]], [[Drouwen]] and elsewhere. Broken bronze objects found in [[Voorschoten]] were apparently destined for recycling. This indicates how valuable bronze was considered in the Bronze Age. Typical bronze objects from this period included knives, swords, axes, [[fibulae]] and bracelets.\n\n[[File:BronzAgeElp.png|thumb|left|Location of the [[Elp culture|Elp]] and [[Hilversum culture]]s in the Bronze Age.]]\nMost of the Bronze Age objects found in the Netherlands have been found in [[Drenthe]]. One item shows that trading networks during this period extended a far distance. Large bronze ''situlae'' (buckets) found in Drenthe were manufactured somewhere in eastern France or in [[Switzerland]]. They were used for mixing wine with water (a Roman/Greek custom). The many finds in Drenthe of rare and valuable objects, such as tin-bead necklaces, suggest that Drenthe was a trading centre in the Netherlands in the Bronze Age.\n\nThe [[Beaker culture|Bell Beaker cultures]] (2700\u20132100) locally developed into the Bronze Age Barbed-Wire Beaker culture (2100\u20131800). In the second millennium BC, the region was the boundary between the [[Atlantic Bronze Age|Atlantic]] and [[Nordic Bronze Age|Nordic]] horizons and was split into a northern and a southern region, roughly divided by the course of the [[Rhine]].\n\nIn the north, the [[Elp culture]] (c. 1800 to 800 BC)<ref>According to \"Het Archeologisch Basisregister\" (ABR), version 1.0 November 1992, [http://www.racm.nl/content/documenten%5Cabr%20website.pdf], ''Elp K\u00fcmmerkeramik'' is dated BRONSMA (early MBA) to BRONSL (LBA) and this has been standardized by \"De Rijksdienst voor Archeologie, Cultuurlandschap en Monumenten\" (RACM) as being at the period starting at 1800 BC and ending at 800 BC.{{Failed verification|date=October 2011}} {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> was a Bronze Age archaeological culture having [[earthenware]] pottery of low quality known as \"''K\u00fcmmerkeramik''\" (or \"''Grobkeramik''\") as a marker. The initial phase was characterized by [[tumulus|tumuli]] (1800\u20131200 BC) that were strongly tied to contemporary tumuli in northern Germany and Scandinavia, and were apparently related to the [[Tumulus culture]] (1600\u20131200 BC) in central Europe. This phase was followed by a subsequent change featuring [[Urnfield]] ([[cremation]]) burial customs (1200\u2013800 BC). The southern region became dominated by the [[Hilversum culture]] (1800\u2013800), which apparently inherited the cultural ties with Britain of the previous Barbed-Wire Beaker culture.\n\n== The pre-Roman period (800 BC \u2013 58 BC) ==\n\n===Iron Age===\n[[File:Boerderij IJzertijd Reijntjesveld.jpg|thumb|A reconstruction of an [[iron age]] dwelling on the Reijntjesveld near [[Orvelte]] in [[Drenthe]].]]\n[[File:Verbogen Keltische zwaard.jpg|thumb|The original curved iron sword from the [[Vorstengraf (Oss)]], [[Rijksmuseum van Oudheden]].]]\n\nThe [[Iron Age]] brought a measure of prosperity to the people living in the area of the present-day Netherlands. Iron ore was available throughout the country, including [[bog iron]] extracted from the [[ore]] in [[peat bogs]] (''moeras ijzererts'') in the north, the natural iron-bearing balls found in the [[Veluwe]] and the red iron ore near the rivers in Brabant. [[Blacksmith|Smiths]] travelled from small settlement to settlement with [[bronze]] and iron, fabricating tools on demand, including axes, knives, pins, arrowheads and swords. Some evidence even suggests the making of [[Damascus steel]] swords using an advanced method of [[forging]] that combined the flexibility of iron with the strength of steel.\n\nIn [[Oss]], a grave dating from around 500 BC was found in a burial mound 52 metres wide (and thus the largest of its kind in western Europe). Dubbed the \"king's grave\" (''[[Vorstengraf (Oss)]]''), it contained extraordinary objects, including an iron sword with an inlay of gold and coral.\n\nIn the centuries just before the arrival of the Romans, northern areas formerly occupied by the Elp culture emerged as the probably Germanic Harpstedt culture<ref name=Mallory>Mallory, J.P., ''In Search of the Indo-Europeans: Language, Archaeology and Myth'', London: Thames & Hudson, 1989, p. 87.</ref> while the southern parts were influenced by the [[Hallstatt culture]] and assimilated into the Celtic [[La T\u00e8ne culture]]. The contemporary southern and western migration of Germanic groups and the northern expansion of the Hallstatt culture drew these peoples into each other's sphere of influence.<ref>Butler, J.J., ''Nederland in de bronstijd'', Bussum: Fibula-Van Dishoeck, 1969, p. {{Page needed|date=October 2011}}.</ref> This is consistent with [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s account of the Rhine forming the boundary between Celtic and Germanic tribes.\n\n===Arrival of Germanic groups===\n[[File:Germanic tribes (750BC-1AD).png|thumb|left|Distribution of the primary Germanic groups c. 1 AD.]]\n\nThe [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes originally inhabited southern [[Scandinavia]], Schleswig-Holstein and [[Hamburg]],<ref name=\"Werner Hilgemann p.109\">Kinder, Hermann and Werner Hilgemann, ''The Penguin Atlas of World History''; translated by Ernest A.

One of the most important is Caesar's own ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]''. Two main tribes he described as living in what is now the Netherlands were the [[Menapii]], and the [[Eburones]], both in the south, which is where Caesar was active. He established the principle that the Rhine defined a natural boundary between [[Gaul]] and [[Germania magna]]. But the Rhine was not a strong border, and he made it clear that there was a part of Belgic Gaul where many of the local tribes (including the Eburones) were \"[[Germani cisrhenani]]\", or in other cases, of mixed origin.\n\nThe Menapii stretched from the south of Zeeland, through [[North Brabant]] (and possibly [[South Holland]]), into the southeast of [[Gelderland]]. In later Roman times their territory seems to have been divided or reduced, so that it became mainly contained in what is now western Belgium.\n\nThe [[Eburones]], the largest of the ''Germani Cisrhenani'' group, covered a large area including at least part of modern [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Dutch Limburg]], stretching east to the [[Rhine]] in Germany, and also northwest to the delta, giving them a border with the Menapii. Their territory may have stretched into Gelderland.\n\nIn the delta itself, Caesar makes a passing comment about the ''Insula Batavorum'' (\"Island of the Batavi\") in the [[Rhine river]], without discussing who lived there. Later, in imperial times, a tribe called the Batavi became very important in this region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0001:book=4:chapter=10&highlight=batavi|title=C.

Very often this involved large-scale conflict with the free Germanic tribes over the Rhine.\n\nOther tribes who eventually inhabited the islands in the delta during Roman times are mentioned by [[Pliny the Elder]] are the [[Cananefates]] in South Holland; the [[Frisii]], covering most of the modern Netherlands north of the [[Oude Rijn (Utrecht and South Holland)|Oude Rijn]]; the [[Frisiabones]], who apparently stretched from the delta into the North of North Brabant; the [[Marsacii]], who stretched from the Flemish coast, into the delta; and the [[Sturii]].<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0137:book=4:chapter=29 Plin.

(Tacitus reported that the Tungri was a new name for the earlier ''Germani cisrhenani''.)\n\nNorth of the Old Rhine, apart from the Frisii, Pliny reports some [[Chauci]] reached into the delta, and two other tribes known from the eastern Netherlands were the [[Tuihanti]] (or Tubantes) from [[Twenthe]] in Overijssel, and the [[Chamavi]], from [[Hamaland]] in northern Gelderland, who became one of the first tribes to be named as [[Franks|Frankish]] (see below). The [[Salians]], also Franks, probably originated in [[Salland]] in Overijssel, before they moved into the empire, forced by Saxons in the 4th century, first into Batavia, and then into Toxandria.\n\n===Roman settlements in the Netherlands===\n{{multiple image|perrow=2|total_width=350|caption_align=center\n| title = Roman settlements\n| image1 = Ruitermasker matilo.jpg|caption1=Mask of a Roman horseman, discovered near [[Leiden]].\n| image2 = Germania 70.svg|caption2=Rhine Frontier of the [[Roman Empire]] around 70 CE. \n}}\nStarting about 15 BC, the [[Rhine]], in the Netherlands came to be defended by the Lower [[Limes Germanicus]]. After a series of military actions, the Rhine became fixed around 12 AD as Rome's northern frontier on the European mainland. A number of towns and developments would arise along this line. The area to the south would be integrated into the [[Roman Empire]]. At first part of [[Gallia Belgica]], this area became part of the [[Roman province|province]] of [[Germania Inferior]]. The tribes already within, or relocated to, this area became part of the [[Roman Empire]]. The area to the north of the Rhine, inhabited by the [[Frisii]] and the [[Chauci]], remained outside Roman rule but not its presence and control.\n\nRomans built military forts along the [[Limes Germanicus]] and a number of towns and smaller settlements in the Netherlands. The more notable Roman towns were at [[Nijmegen]] ([[:nl:Ulpia Noviomagus Batavorum|Ulpia Noviomagus Batavorum]]) and at [[Voorburg]] ([[Forum Hadriani]]).\n\nPerhaps the most evocative Roman ruin is the mysterious [[Brittenburg]], which emerged from the sand at the beach in Katwijk several centuries ago, only to be buried again.

In the first centuries after Rome's conquest of Gaul, trade flourished. And Roman, Gaulish and Germanic material culture are found combined in the region.\n\nHowever, the Batavians rose against the Romans in the [[Batavian rebellion]] of 69 AD. The leader of this [[Revolt of the Batavi|revolt]] was Batavian [[Gaius Julius Civilis]]. One of the causes of the rebellion was that the Romans had taken young Batavians as [[Slavery|slaves]]. A number of Roman ''castella'' were attacked and burnt. Other Roman soldiers in [[Xanten]] and elsewhere and auxiliary troops of Batavians and [[Canninefates|Canninefatae]] in the legions of [[Vitellius]]) joined the revolt, thus splitting the northern part of the Roman army. In April 70 AD, a few legions sent by [[Vespasianus]] and commanded by [[Quintus Petillius Cerialis]] eventually defeated the Batavians and negotiated surrender with [[Gaius Julius Civilis]] somewhere between the [[Waal (river)|Waal]] and the [[Meuse River|Maas]] near Noviomagus ([[Nijmegen]]), which was probably called \"Batavodurum\" by the Batavians.<ref>[http://classics.mit.edu/Tacitus/histories.html ''Historiae''], Tacitus, 109 AD, Translated by Alfred John Church and William Jackson Brodribb.</ref> The Batavians later merged with other tribes and became part of the [[Salian Franks]].\n\nDutch writers in the 17th and 18th centuries saw the rebellion of the independent and freedom-loving Batavians as mirroring the Dutch revolt against Spain and other forms of tyranny. According to this nationalist view, the [[Batavians]] were the \"true\" forefathers of the Dutch, which explains the recurring use of the name over the centuries. [[Jakarta]] was named \"Batavia\" by the Dutch in 1619. The Dutch republic created in 1795 on the basis of French revolutionary principles was called the [[Batavian Republic]].

By about 320, the Franks had the region of the [[Scheldt]] river (present day west Flanders and southwest Netherlands) under control, and were raiding the [[English Channel|Channel]], disrupting transportation to [[Roman Britain|Britain]].

The southern Netherlands remained the northern part of [[Austrasia]] until the rise of the [[Carolingians]].\n\nThe Franks who expanded south into [[Gaul]] settled there and eventually adopted the [[Vulgar Latin]] of the local population.<ref name=\"Verhaal\"/> However, a Germanic language was spoken as a second tongue by public officials in western [[Austrasia]] and [[Neustria]] as late as the 850s.

Some went further by ascribing certain attributes, values and strengths to these various groups and proposing that they reflected 19th-century nationalist and religious views. In particular, it was believed that this theory explained why Belgium and the southern Netherlands (i.e. the Franks) had become Catholic and the northern Netherlands (Frisians and Saxons) had become Protestant. The success of this theory was partly due to anthropological theories based on a tribal paradigm. Being politically and geographically inclusive, and yet accounting for diversity, this theory was in accordance with the need for nation-building and integration during the 1890\u20131914 period. The theory was taught in Dutch schools.\n\nHowever, the disadvantages of this historical interpretation became apparent. This tribal-based theory suggested that external borders were weak or non-existent and that there were clear-cut internal borders. This origins myth provided an historical premise, especially during the Second World War, for regional separatism and annexation to Germany. After 1945 the tribal paradigm lost its appeal for anthropological scholars and historians. When the accuracy of the three-tribe theme was fundamentally questioned, the theory fell out of favour.<ref name=\"Marnix Beyen 1850\"/>\n\nDue to the scarcity of written sources, knowledge of this period depends to a large degree on the interpretation of archaeological data. The traditional view of a clear-cut division between [[Frisians]] in the north and coast, [[Franks]] in the south and [[Saxons]] in the east has proven historically problematic.<ref>Blok, D.P. (1974), ''De Franken in Nederland'', Bussum: Unieboek, 1974, pp. 36\u201338 on the uncertain identity of the Frisians in early Frankish sources; pp. 54\u201355 on the problems concerning \"Saxon\" as a tribal name.</ref><ref>van Eijnatten, J. and F. van Lieburg, ''Nederlandse religiegeschiedenis'' (Hilversum, 2006), pp. 42\u201343, on the uncertain identity of the \"Frisians\" in early Frankish sources.</ref><ref>de Nijs, T, E.

(2003), pp. 30\u201333</ref>\n\n===The emergence of the Dutch language===\n{{Main|Old Dutch|Old Frisian|Dutch Low Saxon}}\nThe language from which [[Old Dutch]] (also sometimes called [[Old West Low Franconian]], [[Old Low Franconian]] or [[Old Frankish]]) arose is not known with certainty, but it is thought to be the language spoken by the [[Salian Franks]]. Even though the Franks are traditionally categorized as [[Weser-Rhine Germanic]], Dutch has a number of [[Ingvaeonic]] characteristics and is classified by modern linguists as an [[Ingvaeonic]] language. Dutch also has a number of [[Old Saxon]] characteristics. There was a close relationship between [[Old Dutch]], [[Old Saxon]], [[Old English]] and [[Old Frisian]]. Because texts written in the language spoken by the Franks are almost non-existent, and [[Old Dutch]] texts scarce and fragmentary, not much is known about the development of [[Old Dutch]]. [[Old Dutch]] made the transition to [[Middle Dutch]] around 1150.<ref name=\"Verhaal\"/>\n\n===Christianization===\nThe Christianity that arrived in the Netherlands with the Romans appears not to have died out completely (in [[Maastricht]], at least) after the withdrawal of the Romans in about 411.<ref name=\"Milis, L.J.R. pp. 6-18\"/>\n\nThe [[Franks]] became Christians after their king [[Clovis I]] converted to Catholicism, an event which is traditionally set in 496. Christianity was introduced in the north after the conquest of [[Friesland]] by the [[Franks]]. The [[Saxons]] in the east were converted before the conquest of [[Saxony]], and became Frankish allies.\n\n[[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Hiberno-Scottish]] and [[Anglo-Saxon mission|Anglo-Saxon]] missionaries, particularly [[Willibrord]], [[Wulfram of Sens|Wulfram]] and [[Boniface]], played an important role in converting the Frankish and Frisian peoples to Christianity by the 8th century. Boniface was martyred by the [[Frisians]] in [[Dokkum]] (754).\n\n===Frankish dominance and incorporation into the Holy Roman Empire===\n{{Main|Frisian-Frankish Wars}}\n[[File:Radboud doopvont.jpg|thumb|left|An early 16th-century tapestry depicting the near baptism of [[Redbad, King of the Frisians]], who died in 719 CE.]]\n\nIn the early 8th century the Frisians came increasingly into conflict with the [[Franks]] to the south, resulting in a [[Frisian\u2013Frankish wars|series of wars]] in which the [[Frankish Empire]] eventually subjugated Frisia. In 734, at the [[Battle of the Boarn]], the Frisians in the Netherlands were defeated by the [[Franks]], who thereby conquered the area west of the [[Lauwers]]. The Franks then conquered the area east of the Lauwers in 785 when [[Charlemagne]] defeated [[Widukind]].\n\nThe linguistic descendants of the Franks, the modern [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Dutch language|-speakers]] of the [[Netherlands]] and [[Flanders]], seem to have broken with the [[Exonym and endonym|endonym]] \"Frank\" around the 9th century. By this time Frankish identity had changed from an ethnic identity to a national identity, becoming localized and confined to the modern ''[[Franconia]]'' and principally to the French province of ''[[\u00cele-de-France]]''.<ref>van der Wal, M., ''Geschiedenis van het Nederlands'', 1992 {{Full citation needed|date=November 2012}}, p. {{Page needed|date=October 2011}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the people no longer referred to themselves as \"Franks\", the Netherlands was still part of the [[Frankish empire]] of [[Charlemagne]]. Indeed, because of the Austrasian origins of the Carolingians in the area between the Rhine and the Maas, the cities of Aachen, Maastricht, Li\u00e8ge and Nijmegen were at the heart of Carolingian culture.<ref name=\"Milis, L.J.R. pp. 6-18\"/> Charlemagne maintained his ''palatium''<ref>{{cite web|title=Charlemagne: Court and administration|encyclopedia= [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/106546/Charlemagne/256621/Court-and-administration}} (\"Charlemagne relied on his palatium, a shifting assemblage of family members, trusted lay and ecclesiastical companions, and assorted hangers-on, which constituted an itinerant court following the king as he carried out his military campaigns and sought to take advantage of the income from widely scattered royal estates.\")</ref> in [[Nijmegen]] at least four times.\n\nThe [[Carolingian empire]] would eventually include France, Germany, northern Italy and much of Western Europe. In 843, the Frankish empire was divided into three parts, giving rise to [[West Francia]] in the west, [[East Francia]] in the east, and [[Middle Francia]] in the centre. Most of what is today the Netherlands became part of [[Middle Francia]]; Flanders became part of [[West Francia]]. This division was an important factor in the historical distinction between Flanders and the other Dutch-speaking areas.\n\n[[Middle Francia]] ({{lang-la|Francia media}}) was an ephemeral [[Francia|Frankish]] kingdom that had no historical or ethnic identity to bind its varied peoples. It was created by the [[Treaty of Verdun]] in 843, which divided the [[Carolingian Empire]] among the sons of [[Louis the Pious]]. Situated between the realms of [[East Francia|East]] and [[West Francia]], Middle Francia comprised the Frankish territory between the rivers [[Rhine]] and [[Scheldt]], the [[Frisia]]n coast of the [[North Sea]], the former [[Kingdom of Burgundy]] (except for a western portion, later known as [[Duchy of Burgundy|''Bourgogne'']]), [[Provence]] and the [[Kingdom of Italy (medieval)|Kingdom of Italy]].\n\nMiddle Francia fell to [[Lothair I]], the eldest son and successor of [[Louis the Pious]], after an intermittent civil war with his younger brothers [[Louis the German]] and [[Charles the Bald]]. In acknowledgement of Lothair's [[Holy Roman Emperor|Imperial]] title, Middle Francia contained the imperial cities of [[Aachen]], the residence of [[Charlemagne]], as well as Rome. In 855, on his deathbed at [[Pr\u00fcm Abbey]], Emperor Lothair I again partitioned his realm amongst his sons. Most of the lands north of the [[Alps]], including the Netherlands, passed to [[Lothair II of Lotharingia|Lothair II]] and consecutively were named [[Lotharingia]]. After Lothair II died in 869, Lotharingia was partitioned by his uncles Louis the German and Charles the Bald in the [[Treaty of Meerssen]] in 870. Although some of the Netherlands had come under Viking control, in 870 it technically became part of [[East Francia]], which became the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 962.\n\n===Viking raids===\n[[File:Rorik by H. W. Koekkoek.jpg|thumb|[[Rorik of Dorestad]], [[Viking]] conqueror and ruler of [[Friesland]], a romantic 1912 depiction by [[Johannes Hermanus Koekkoek|Johannes H. Koekkoek]].]]\nIn the 9th and 10th centuries, the Vikings raided the largely defenceless [[Frisians|Frisian]] and [[Franks|Frankish]] towns lying on the coast and along the rivers of the [[Low Countries]]. Although Vikings never settled in large numbers in those areas, they did set up long-term bases and were even acknowledged as lords in a few cases. In Dutch and Frisian historical tradition, the trading centre of [[Dorestad]] declined after Viking raids from 834 to 863; however, since no convincing Viking archaeological evidence has been found at the site (as of 2007), doubts about this have grown in recent years.<ref>More info about Viking raids can be found online at L. van der Tuuk, [http://home.tiscali.nl/gjallar/index.html Gjallar. Noormannen in de Lage Landen]</ref>\n\nOne of the most important Viking families in the Low Countries was that of [[Rorik of Dorestad]] (based in [[Wieringen]]) and his brother the \"younger Harald\" (based in [[Walcheren]]), both thought to be nephews of [[Harald Klak]].<ref>Baldwin, Stephen, [http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/GEN-MEDIEVAL/2002-09/1031544685 \"Danish Haralds in 9th Century Frisia\"]. Retrieved 9 October 2011.</ref> Around 850, [[Lothair I]] acknowledged Rorik as ruler of most of Friesland. And again in 870, Rorik was received by [[Charles the Bald]] in [[Nijmegen]], to whom he became a vassal. Viking raids continued during that period. Harald's son Rodulf and his men were killed by the people of [[Oostergo]] in 873. Rorik died sometime before 882.\n\nBuried Viking treasures consisting mainly of silver have been found in the Low Countries. Two such treasures have been found in Wieringen. A large treasure found in Wieringen in 1996 dates from around 850 and is thought perhaps to have been connected to Rorik. The burial of such a valuable treasure is seen as an indication that there was a permanent settlement in Wieringen.<ref>\"[http://www.museumkennis.nl/lp.rmo/museumkennis/i000412.html Vikingschat van Wieringen\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718064223/http://www.museumkennis.nl/lp.rmo/museumkennis/i000412.html |date=18 July 2011 }}, Museumkennis.nl. Retrieved 9 October 2011.</ref>\n\nAround 879, Godfrid arrived in Frisian lands as the head of a large force that terrorised the Low Countries. Using [[Ghent]] as his base, they ravaged Ghent, [[Maastricht]], [[Li\u00e8ge]], [[Stavelot]], [[Pr\u00fcm]], [[Cologne]], and [[Koblenz]]. Controlling most of Frisia between 882 and his death in 885, Godfrid became known to history as [[Godfrid, Duke of Frisia]]. His lordship over Frisia was acknowledged by [[Charles the Fat]], to whom he became a vassal. Godfried was assassinated in 885, after which [[Gerolf of Holland]] assumed lordship and Viking rule of Frisia came to an end.\n\nViking raids of the Low Countries continued for over a century. Remains of Viking attacks dating from 880 to 890 have been found in [[Zutphen]] and [[Deventer]]. In 920, King [[Henry I of Germany|Henry]] of Germany liberated [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]. According to a number of chronicles, the last attacks took place in the first decade of the 11th century and were directed at [[Tiel]] and/or [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]].<ref>Jesch, Judith, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=RkNY2KrdvscC&pg=PA82 Ships and Men in the Late Viking Age: The Vocabulary of Runic Inscriptions and Skaldic Verse]'', Boydell & Brewer, 2001. {{ISBN|978-0-85115-826-6}}. p. 82.</ref>\n\nThese Viking raids occurred about the same time that French and German lords were fighting for supremacy over the middle empire that included the Netherlands, so their sway over this area was weak. Resistance to the Vikings, if any, came from local nobles, who gained in stature as a result.\n\n==High and Late Middle Ages (1000\u20131432)==\n\n===Part of the Holy Roman Empire===\nThe German kings and emperors ruled the Netherlands in the 10th and 11th century. Germany was called the Holy Roman Empire after the coronation of [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|King Otto the Great]] as emperor. The Dutch city of [[Nijmegen]] used to be the spot of an important domain of the German emperors. Several German emperors were born and died there, including for example [[Byzantine]] empress [[Theophanu]], who died in Nijmegen. Utrecht was also an important city and trading port at the time.\n\n===Political disunity===\n[[File:Valkhofkapel.JPG|thumb|Chapel of St Nicholas ({{Interlanguage link multi|Sint-Nicolaaskapel|nl}} or Valkhofkapel) in [[Nijmegen]], one of the oldest buildings in the Netherlands.]]\n\nThe Holy Roman Empire was not able to maintain political unity. In addition to the growing independence of the towns, local rulers turned their counties and duchies into private kingdoms and felt little sense of obligation to the emperor who reigned over large parts of the nation in name only. Large parts of what now comprise the Netherlands were governed by the Count of Holland, the Duke of [[Gelre]], the Duke of Brabant and the Bishop of Utrecht. [[Friesland]] and [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] in the north maintained their independence and were governed by the lower nobility.\n\nThe various feudal states were in a state of almost continual war. [[Gelre]] and Holland fought for control of [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]]. Utrecht, whose bishop had in 1000 ruled over half of what is today the Netherlands, was marginalised as it experienced continuing difficulty in electing new bishops. At the same time, the dynasties of neighbouring states were more stable. [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], [[Drenthe]] and most of Gelre, which used to be part of Utrecht, became independent. Brabant tried to conquer its neighbours, but was not successful.  Holland also tried to assert itself in Zeeland and Friesland, but its attempts failed.\n\n===The Frisians===\nThe language and culture of most of the people who lived in the area that is now Holland were originally [[Frisia]]n. The sparsely populated area was known as \"West Friesland\" (''Westfriesland''). As Frankish settlement progressed, the Frisians migrated away or were absorbed and the area quickly became [[Old Dutch|Dutch]].  (The part of North Holland situated north of [[Alkmaar]] is still colloquially known as West Friesland).\n\nThe rest of [[Friesland]] in the north continued to maintain its independence during this time. It had its own institutions (collectively called the \"[[Frisian freedom]]\") and resented the imposition of the feudal system and the patriciate found in other European towns. They regarded themselves as allies of Switzerland. The Frisian battle cry was \"better dead than a slave\". They later lost their independence when they were defeated in 1498 by the German [[Landsknecht]] mercenaries of [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Duke Albrecht of Saxony-Meissen]].\n\n===The rise of Holland===\n[[File:Rochussen Egmond.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dirk VI, Count of Holland]], 1114\u20131157, and his mother Petronella visiting the work on the [[Egmond Abbey]], Charles Rochussen, 1881.

Originally granted as a fief to the Danish chieftain [[Rorik of Dorestad|Rorik]] in return for loyalty to the emperor in 862, the region of [[Kennemerland|Kennemara]] (the region around modern [[Haarlem]]) rapidly grew under Rorik's descendants in size and importance. By the early 11th century, [[Dirk III, Count of Holland]] was levying tolls on the Meuse estuary and was able to resist military intervention from his overlord, the Duke of Lower Lorraine.\n\nIn 1083, the name \"Holland\" first appears in a deed referring to a region corresponding more or less to the current province of South Holland and the southern half of what is now North Holland. Holland's influence continued to grow over the next two centuries. The [[counts of Holland]] conquered most of [[Zeeland]] but it was not until 1289 that Count [[Floris V]] was able to subjugate the Frisians in West Friesland (that is, the northern half of North Holland).\n\n===Expansion and growth===\n{{Main|History of urban centers in the Dutch Low Countries}}\n\nAround 1000 AD there were several agricultural developments (described sometimes as an agricultural revolution) that resulted in an increase in production, especially food production. The economy started to develop at a fast pace, and the higher productivity allowed workers to farm more land or to become tradesmen.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nMuch of the western Netherlands was barely inhabited between the end of the Roman period until around 1100 AD, when farmers from [[Flanders]] and [[Utrecht]] began purchasing the swampy land, draining it and cultivating it. This process happened quickly and the uninhabited territory was settled in a few generations. They built independent farms that were not part of villages, something unique in Europe at the time.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n[[Guilds]] were established and markets developed as production exceeded local needs. Also, the introduction of currency made trading a much easier affair than it had been before. Existing towns grew and new towns sprang into existence around [[monasteries]] and [[castles]], and a mercantile middle class began to develop in these urban areas. Commerce and town development increased as the population grew.\n\nThe [[Crusade]]s were popular in the Low Countries and drew many to fight in the [[Holy Land]]. At home, there was relative peace. Viking pillaging had stopped. Both the Crusades and the relative peace at home contributed to trade and the growth in commerce.\n\nCities arose and flourished, especially in [[Flanders]] and [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]]. As the cities grew in wealth and power, they started to buy certain privileges for themselves from the [[monarch|sovereign]], including [[City rights in the Low Countries|city rights]], the right to self-government and the right to pass laws. In practice, this meant that the wealthiest cities became quasi-independent republics in their own right. Two of the most important cities were [[Brugge]] and [[Antwerp]] (in [[Flanders]]) which would later develop into some of the most important cities and ports in Europe.\n\n===Hook and Cod Wars===\n{{Main|Hook and Cod wars}}\n[[File:Jacoba van Beieren (1401-1436), gravin van Holland en Zeeland.jpg|thumb|[[Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut]], 1401\u20131436, known to the Dutch as \"Jacoba of Bavaria\".]]\nThe [[Hook and Cod Wars]] ({{lang-nl|Hoekse en Kabeljauwse twisten}}) were a series of wars and battles in the [[County of Holland]] between 1350 and 1490. Most of these wars were fought over the title of [[count of Holland]], but some have argued that the underlying reason was because of the power struggle of the [[bourgeois]] in the cities against the ruling nobility.\n\nThe Cod faction generally consisted of the more progressive cities of [[Holland]].  The Hook faction consisted for a large part of the conservative noblemen. Some of the main figures in this multi-generational conflict were [[William IV, Count of Holland|William IV]], [[Margaret II, Countess of Hainaut|Margaret]], [[William V, Count of Hainaut|William V]], [[William VI, Count of Holland]] and Hainaut, [[John, Duke of Bavaria-Straubing|John]] and [[Philip III, Duke of Burgundy|Philip the Good]], [[Duke of Burgundy]]. But perhaps the most well known is [[Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut]].\n\nThe conquest of the county of Holland by the Duke [[Philip the Good]] of Burgundy was an odd affair. Leading noblemen in Holland invited the duke to conquer Holland, even though he had no historical claim to it. Some historians{{Who|date=February 2010}} say that the ruling class in Holland wanted Holland to integrate with the [[Flanders|Flemish]] economic system and adopt Flemish legal institutions. Europe had been wracked by many civil wars in the 14th and 15th centuries, while Flanders had grown rich and enjoyed peace.\n\n== Burgundian and Habsburg period (1433\u20131567) ==\n[[File:Political map of the Low Countries (1350)-NL.svg|thumb|left|The Low Countries in the late 14th century CE.]]\n\n===Burgundian period===\n{{Main|Burgundian Netherlands}}\nMost of what is now the Netherlands and Belgium was eventually united by the Duke of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] in 1433. Before the Burgundian union, the Dutch identified themselves by the town they lived in, their local duchy or county or as subjects of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The Burgundian period is when the Dutch began the road to nationhood.\n\nHolland's trade developed rapidly, especially in the areas of shipping and transport. The new rulers defended Dutch trading interests. The fleets of Holland defeated the fleets of the [[Hanseatic League]] several times. Amsterdam grew and in the 15th century became the primary trading port in Europe for grain from the Baltic region. Amsterdam distributed grain to the major cities of Belgium, Northern France and England. This trade was vital to the people of Holland, because Holland could no longer produce enough grain to feed itself. Land drainage had caused the peat of the former [[wetland]]s to reduce to a level that was too low for drainage to be maintained.\n\n===Habsburg rule from Spain===\n{{Main|Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor}}\n[[File:Hadrian VI.jpg|thumb|Influential [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] theologian Adriaan Florenszoon Boeyens, 1459\u20131523, was an advisor to Charles; in the last year of his life he became pope as [[Pope Adrian VI]] (1522\u201323).]]\n[[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] (1500\u201358) was born and raised in the [[County of Flanders|Flemish]] city of [[Ghent]]; he spoke French.  Charles extended the Burgundian territory with the annexation of [[Tournai]], Artois, [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]], [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] and [[Guelders]]. The [[Seventeen Provinces]] had been unified by Charles's Burgundian ancestors, but nominally were [[fief]]s of either France or the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. When he was a minor, his aunt [[Margaret of Austria (1480-1530)|Margaret]] acted as regent until 1515. France relinquished its ancient claim on [[Flanders]] in 1528.<ref>{{cite book|author=James D.

[[Gelre]] attempted to build up its own state in northeast Netherlands and northwest Germany. Lacking funds in the 16th century, Gelre had its soldiers provide for themselves by pillaging enemy terrain. These soldiers were a great menace to the Burgundian Netherlands, as when they pillaged [[The Hague]].\n\nThe dukes of Burgundy over the years through astute marriages, purchases and wars, had taken control of the [[Seventeen Provinces]] that made up the Low Countries. They are now the Netherlands in the north, the [[Southern Netherlands]] (now Belgium) in the south, and Luxemburg in the southeast. Known as the \"Burgundian Circle,\" these lands came under the control of the Habsburg family. [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles]] (1500\u201358) became the owner in 1506, but in 1515 he left to become king of Spain and later became the Holy Roman Emperor. Charles turned over control to regents (his close relatives), and in practice rule was exercised by Spaniards he controlled. The provinces each had their own governments and courts, controlled by the local nobility, and their own traditions and rights (\"liberties\") dating back centuries. Likewise the numerous cities had their own legal rights and local governments, usually controlled by the merchants, On top of this the Spanish had imposed an overall government, the Estates General of the Netherlands, with its own officials and courts.<ref>H.G. Koenigsberger, \"The Beginnings of the States General of the Netherlands,\" ''Parliaments, Estates and Representation'' (1988) 8#2 pp 101\u201314.</ref> The Spanish officials sent by Charles ignored traditions and the Dutch nobility as well as local officials, inciting an anti-Spanish sense of nationalism, and leading to the [[Dutch Revolt]]. With the emergence of the Protestant Reformation, Charles\u2014now the Emperor\u2014was determined to crush Protestantism and never compromise with it. Unrest began in the south, centered in the large rich metropolis of Antwerp.

Po-chia Hsia, ed. ''A Companion to the Reformation World'' (2006) pp. 118\u201334</ref> Dutch [[Protestants]], after initial repression, were tolerated by local authorities.

Israel, ''The Dutch Republic Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall 1477\u20131806'' (1995) p. 104</ref> In a society dependent on trade, freedom and tolerance were considered essential. Nevertheless, the Catholic rulers Charles V, and later [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], made it their mission to defeat Protestantism, which was considered a heresy by the Catholic Church and a threat to the stability of the whole hierarchical political system. On the other hand, the intensely moralistic Dutch Protestants insisted their Biblical theology, sincere piety and humble lifestyle was morally superior to the luxurious habits and superficial religiosity of the ecclesiastical nobility.<ref>Hsia, ed. ''A Companion to the Reformation World'' (2006) pp. 3\u201336</ref> The rulers' harsh punitive measures led to increasing grievances in the Netherlands, where the local governments had embarked on a course of peaceful coexistence. In the second half of the century, the situation escalated. Philip sent troops to crush the rebellion and make the Netherlands once more a Catholic region.<ref>Israel, ''The Dutch Republic Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall 1477\u20131806'' (1995) p. 155</ref>\n\nIn the first wave of the Reformation, [[Lutheranism]] won over the elites in Antwerp and the South.  The Spanish successfully suppressed it there, and Lutheranism only flourished in east Friesland.<ref>Israel, ''The Dutch Republic: Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall, 1477\u20131806'' (1995) pp. 374\u201375</ref>\n\nThe second wave of the Reformation, came in the form of [[Anabaptism]], that was popular among ordinary farmers in [[Holland]] and [[Friesland]]. Anabaptists were socially very radical and equalitarian; they believed that the apocalypse was very near. They refused to live the old way, and began new communities, creating considerable chaos. A prominent Dutch Anabaptist was [[Menno Simons]], who initiated the [[Mennonite]] church. The movement was allowed in the north, but never grew to a large scale.<ref>Israel, ''The Dutch Republic: Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall, 1477\u20131806'' (1995) pp. 86\u201391</ref>\n\nThe third wave of the Reformation, that ultimately proved to be permanent, was [[Calvinism]]. It arrived in the Netherlands in the 1540s, attracting both the elite and the common population, especially in [[Flanders]]. The Catholic Spanish responded with harsh persecution and introduced the [[Inquisition of the Netherlands]]. Calvinists rebelled. First there was the [[Beeldenstorm|iconoclasm]] in 1566, which was the systematic destruction of statues of saints and other Catholic devotional depictions in churches. In 1566, [[William the Silent]], a Calvinist, started the [[Eighty Years' War]] to liberate all Dutch of whatever religion from Catholic Spain. Blum says, \"His patience, tolerance, determination, concern for his people, and belief in government by consent held the Dutch together and kept alive their spirit of revolt.\"<ref>Jerome Blum et al, ''The European World: A History'' (1970) pp 160\u201361</ref>  The provinces of [[Holland]] and [[Zeeland]], being mainly Calvinist by 1572, submitted to the rule of William.

This treaty ended a forty-year period of warfare between France and Spain conducted in Italy from 1521 to 1559.<ref name=\"Albert Guerard 1959 pp. 134\"/> The Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis was somewhat of a watershed\u2014not only for the battleground that Italy had been, but also for northern Europe. Spain had been keeping troops in the Netherlands to be ready to attack France from the north as well as from the south.\n\nWith the settlement of so many major issues between France and Spain by the Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis, there was no longer any reason to keep Spanish troops in the Netherlands.  Thus, the people of the Netherlands could get on with their peacetime pursuits.  As they did so they found that there was a great deal of demand for their products.  Fishing had long been an important part of the economy of the Netherlands.  However, now the fishing of herring alone came to occupy 2,000 boats operating out of Dutch ports. Spain, still the Dutch trader's best customer, was buying fifty large ships full of furniture and household utensils from Flanders merchants. Additionally, Dutch woolen goods were desired everywhere.  The Netherlands bought and processed enough Spanish wool to sell four million florins of wool products through merchants in Bruges. So strong was the Dutch appetite for raw wool at this time that they bought nearly as much English wool as they did Spanish wool.  Total commerce with England alone amounted to 24 million florins.  Much of the export going to England resulted in pure profit to the Dutch because the exported items were of their own manufacture. The Netherlands was just starting to enter its \"Golden Age.\" Brabant and Flanders were the richest and most flourishing parts of the Dutch Republic at the time.<ref name=\"Claflin\">Claflin, W. Harold, ed. ''History of Nations: Holland and Belgium'', (New York: P.F. Collier & Son, 1907), pp. 72\u201374, 103\u201305</ref> The Netherlands was one of the richest places in the world. The population reached 3 million in 1560, with 25 cities of 10,000 people or more, by far the largest urban presence in Europe; with the trading and financial center of Antwerp being especially important (population 100,000). Spain could not afford to lose this rich land, nor allow it to fall from Catholic control. Thus came 80 years of warfare.\n\nA devout Catholic, Philip was appalled by the success of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in the [[Low Countries]], which had led to an increasing number of [[Calvinism|Calvinists]]. His attempts to enforce religious persecution of the Protestants, and his centralization of government, law enforcement, and taxes, made him unpopular and led to a [[revolt]]. [[Fernando Alvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba]], was sent with a Spanish Army to punish the unruly Dutch in 1567.<ref name=\"Motley\">John Lathrop Motley, ''The Rise of the Dutch Republic'' (Harper & Bros.: New York, 1855) pp. 106\u201315, 121, 122, 207, 213</ref>\n\nThe only opposition the Duke of Alba faced in his march across the Netherlands were the nobles, [[Lamoral, Count of Egmont]]; [[Philippe de Montmorency, Count of Horn]] and others. With the approach of Alba and the Spanish army, [[William the Silent]] of Orange fled to Germany with his three brothers and his whole family on 11 April 1567. The Duke of Alba sought to meet and negotiate with the nobles that now faced him with armies.  However, when the nobles arrived in Brussels they were all arrested and Egmont and Horn were executed.<ref name=\"Motley\"/> Alba then revoked all the prior treaties that Margaret, the [[Duchess of Parma]] had signed with the Protestants of the Netherlands and instituted the Inquisition to enforce the decrees of the [[Council of Trent]].\n\n==The Eighty Years' War (1568\u20131648)==\n{{Main|Eighty Years' War|Dutch Revolt}}\n[[File:Slag bij Nieuwpoort.jpg|thumb|[[Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange|Prince Maurits]] at the [[Battle of Nieuwpoort]], 1600 CE, by Paulus van Hillegaert.]]\n[[File:Leo belgicus.png|thumb|[[Leo Belgicus]], a map of the [[low countries]] drawn in the shape of a lion, by [[Claes Jansz. Visscher]] (II), 1609 CE.]]\nThe Dutch War for Independence from Spain is frequently called the [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568\u20131648).  The first fifty years (1568 through 1618) were uniquely a war between Spain and the Netherlands.  During the last thirty years (1618\u20131648) the conflict between Spain and the Netherlands was submerged in the general European War that became known as the [[Thirty Years' War]].<ref>Geoffrey Parker, ed. ''The Thirty Years' War'', New York: Routledge Press, 1987, p. 2.</ref>  The seven rebellious provinces of the Netherlands were eventually united by the [[Union of Utrecht]] in 1579 and formed the [[Republic of the Seven United Netherlands]] (also known as the \"United Provinces\"). The [[Act of Abjuration]] or ''Plakkaat van Verlatinghe'' was signed on 26 July 1581, and was the formal [[declaration of independence]] of the northern [[Low Countries]] from the Spanish king.\n\n[[William the Silent|William of Orange]] (Slot Dillenburg, 24 April 1533 \u2013 Delft, 10 July 1584), the founder of the Dutch royal family, led the Dutch during the first part of the war, following the death of Egmont and Horn in 1568. The very first years were a success for the Spanish troops. However, the Dutch countered subsequent sieges in [[Holland]]. In November and December 1572, all the citizens of [[Zutphen]] and [[Naarden]] were slaughtered by the Spanish. From 11 December that year the city of [[Haarlem]] was besieged, holding out for seven months until 13 July 1573. [[Oudewater]] was conquered by the Spanish on 7 August 1575, and most of its inhabitants were killed. [[Maastricht]] was besieged, sacked and destroyed twice in succession (in 1576 and 1579) by the Spanish.\n\nIn a war composed mostly of sieges rather than battles, [[Alexander Farnese, Prince of Parma|Governor-General Alexander Farnese]] proved his mettle. His strategy was to offer generous terms for the surrender of a city: there would be no more massacres or looting; historic urban privileges were retained; there was a full pardon and amnesty; return to the Catholic Church would be gradual. The conservative Catholics in the south and east supported the Spanish. Farnese recaptured [[Antwerp]] and nearly all of what became Belgium.<ref>Violet Soen, \"Reconquista and Reconciliation in the Dutch Revolt: The Campaign of Governor-General Alexander Farnese (1578\u20131592),\" ''[[Journal of Early Modern History]]'' (2012) 16#1 pp. 1\u201322.</ref> Most of the Dutch-speaking territory in the Netherlands was taken from Spain, but not in [[Flanders]], which to this day remains part of Belgium. Flanders was the most radical anti-Spanish territory. Many Flemish fled to Holland, among them half of the population of Antwerp, 3/4 of Bruges and Ghent and the entire population of Nieuwpoort, Dunkerque and countryside.<ref>Bart de Groof, \"Alexander Farnese and the Origins of Modern Belgium,\" ''Bulletin de l'Institut Historique Belge de Rome'' (1993) Vol. 63, pp. 195\u2013219.</ref> His successful campaign gave the Catholics control of the lower half of the Low Countries, and was part of the [[Counter-Reformation|Catholic Counter-Reformation]].\n\nThe war dragged on for another half century, but the main fighting was over. The [[Peace of Westphalia]], signed in 1648, confirmed the independence of the United Provinces from Spain. The Dutch people started to develop a national identity since the 15th century, but they officially remained a part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] until 1648. National identity was mainly formed by the province people came from. Holland was the most important province by far. The republic of the Seven Provinces came to be known as '''Holland''' across Europe.\n\nThe Catholics in the Netherlands were an outlawed minority that had been suppressed by the Calvinists. After 1572, however, they made a striking comeback (also as part of the Catholic Counter-Reformation), setting up seminaries, reforming their Church, and sending missionaries into Protestant districts. Laity often took the lead; the Calvinist government often arrested or harassed priests who seemed too effective. Catholic numbers stabilized at about a third of the population in the Netherlands; they were strongest in the southeast.<ref>see [http://www.quirksmode.org/politics/kuyper.html religion map]</ref><ref>Charles H.

During the Golden Age, there was a great flowering of trade, industry, the arts and the sciences in the Netherlands. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the Dutch were arguably the most economically wealthy and scientifically advanced of all European nations. This new, officially Calvinist nation flourished culturally and economically, creating what historian [[Simon Schama]] has called an \"embarrassment of riches\".<ref name=\"Schama\">Schama, Simon, ''The Embarrassment of Riches'', Bath: William Collins & Sons, 1987. At p. 8: \"The prodigious quality of their success went to their heads, but it also made them a bit queasy. Even their most uninhibited documents of self-congratulations are haunted by the threat of ''overvloed'', the surfeit that rose like a cresting flood \u2013 a word heavy with warning as well as euphoria...But at the very least, the continuous pricking of conscience on complacency produced the self-consciousness that we think of as embarrassed.\"</ref> [[Tulip mania|Speculation in the tulip trade]] led to a first stock market crash in 1637, but the economic crisis was soon overcome.

In 1602 the [[Dutch East India Company]] (Dutch: ''Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie'' or ''VOC'') was founded. It was the first-ever [[multinational corporation]], financed by shares that established the [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange|first modern stock exchange]]. It became the world's largest commercial enterprise of the 17th century. To finance the growing trade within the region, the [[Bank of Amsterdam]] was established in 1609, the precursor to, if not the first true [[central bank]].<ref>Quinn, Stephen. Roberds, William.

In addition some Portuguese colonies were conquered, namely in Northeastern [[Brazil]], Angola, [[Indonesia]] and [[Ceylon]]. In 1640 by the [[Dutch East India Company]] began a trade monopoly with Japan through the trading post on [[Dejima]].\n\nThe Dutch also dominated trade between European countries. The Low Countries were favorably positioned on a crossing of east-west and north-south trade routes and connected to a large German hinterland through the [[Rhine]] river. Dutch traders shipped wine from France and Portugal to the [[Baltic region|Baltic lands]] and returned with grain destined for countries around the [[Mediterranean Sea]].  By the 1680s, an average of nearly 1000 Dutch ships entered the [[Baltic Sea]] each year.<ref>\"[http://www.balticconnections.net/index.cfm?article=Mercantilism+in+the+West+Baltic Baltic Connections: Mercantilism in the West Baltic] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923181844/http://www.balticconnections.net/index.cfm?article=Mercantilism+in+the+West+Baltic |date=23 September 2015 }}\", BalticConnections.net.

Natuurkundige te Delft Rijksmuseum SK-A-957.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] was a businessman and scientist in the [[Dutch Golden Age|Golden Age of Dutch science and technology]].]]\n[[Renaissance Humanism]], of which [[Desiderius Erasmus]] (c. 1466\u20131536) was an important advocate, had also gained a firm foothold and was partially responsible for a climate of tolerance. Overall, levels of tolerance were sufficiently high to attract religious refugees from other countries, notably Jewish merchants from [[Portugal]] who brought much wealth with them. The revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] in France in 1685 resulted in the immigration of many French [[Huguenots]], many of whom were shopkeepers or scientists. Still tolerance had its limits, as philosopher [[Baruch de Spinoza]] (1632\u20131677) would find out. Due to its climate of intellectual tolerance the Dutch Republic attracted scientists and other thinkers from all over Europe. Especially the renowned [[University of Leiden]] (established in 1575 by the Dutch [[stadtholder]], [[William the Silent|William of Oranje]], as a token of gratitude for Leiden's fierce resistance against Spain during the Eighty Years' War) became a gathering place for these people. For instance French philosopher [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] lived in Leiden from 1628 until 1649.\n\nDutch lawyers were famous for their knowledge of international [[Admiralty law|law of the sea]] and [[commercial law]]. [[Hugo Grotius]] (1583\u20131645) played a leading part in the foundation of [[international law]]. Again due to the Dutch climate of tolerance, book publishers flourished. Many books about religion, philosophy and science that might have been deemed controversial abroad were printed in the Netherlands and secretly exported to other countries. Thus during the 17th century the Dutch Republic became more and more Europe's publishing house.\n\n[[File:Meisje met de parel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Johannes Vermeer]]'s ''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring]]'']]\n\n[[Christiaan Huygens]] (1629\u20131695) was a famous [[astronomer]], [[physicist]] and mathematician. He invented the [[pendulum clock]], which was a major step forward towards exact timekeeping. He contributed to the fields of [[optics]]. The most famous Dutch scientist in the area of optics is certainly [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]], who invented or greatly improved the [[microscope]] (opinions differ) and was the first to methodically study microscopic life, thus laying the foundations for the field of [[microbiology]]. Famous Dutch hydraulic engineer [[Jan Leeghwater]] (1575\u20131650) gained important victories in The Netherlands's eternal battle against the sea. Leeghwater added a considerable amount of land to the republic by converting several large lakes into [[polder]]s, pumping all water out with windmills.\n\nPainting was the dominant art form in 17th-century Holland. [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] followed many of the tendencies that dominated [[Baroque art]] in other parts of Europe, as with the [[Utrecht Caravaggisti]], but was the leader in developing the subjects of [[still life]], [[landscape painting|landscape]], and [[genre painting]]. [[Portrait]]ure were also popular, but [[history painting]] \u2013 traditionally the [[hierarchy of genres|most-elevated genre]] struggled to find buyers.  Church art was virtually non-existent, and little sculpture of any kind produced. While art collecting and painting for the open market was also common elsewhere, art historians point to the growing number of wealthy Dutch middle-class and successful mercantile patrons as driving forces in the popularity of certain pictorial subjects.<ref name=\"gardner\">Gardner, Helen, Fred S. Kleiner, and Christin J.

Some notable artistic styles and trends include Haarlem [[Mannerism]], [[Utrecht Caravaggism]], the [[Delft School (painting)|School of Delft]], the Leiden [[fijnschilder]]s, and Dutch [[classicism]].\n\n[[File:Den Haag, Mauritshuis vanaf Hofvijver 2006-05-29 16.12.JPG|thumb|The [[Dutch Baroque architecture|Dutch Classicist]] [[Mauritshuis]], named after [[John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen|Prince Johan Maurits]] and built 1636\u20131641, was designed by [[Jacob van Campen]] and [[Pieter Post]].]]\nDue to the thriving economy, cities expanded greatly. New town halls, weighhouses and storehouses were built. Merchants that had gained a fortune ordered a new house built along one of the many new canals that were dug out in and around many cities (for defence and transport purposes), a house with an ornamented fa\u00e7ade that befitted their new status. In the countryside, many new castles and stately homes were built. Most of them have not survived. Starting at 1595 Reformed churches were commissioned, many of which are still landmarks today. The most famous Dutch architects of the 17th century were [[Jacob van Campen]], [[Pieter Post]], Pieter Vingbooms, [[Lieven de Key]], [[Hendrick de Keyser]]. Overall, Dutch architecture, which generally combined traditional building styles with some foreign elements, did not develop to the level of painting.\n\nThe Golden Age was also an important time for developments in literature. Some of the major figures of this period were [[Gerbrand Adriaenszoon Bredero]], [[Jacob Cats]], [[Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft]] and [[Joost van den Vondel]]. Since Latin was the lingua franca of education, relatively few men could speak, write, and read Dutch all at the same time.\n\nMusic did not develop very much in the Netherlands since the Calvinists considered it an unnecessary extravagance, and organ music was forbidden in Reformed Church services, although it remained common at secular functions.\n\n==Dutch Empire==\n\n=== The Dutch in the Americas ===\n[[File:GezichtOpNieuwAmsterdam.jpg|thumb|left|200px|New Amsterdam in 1664 CE.]]\n{{main|Dutch West India Company|New Netherland|New Amsterdam}}\n\nThe Dutch West India Company was a [[chartered company]] (known as the \"GWC\") of Dutch merchants. On 2 June 1621, it was granted a [[:wikisource:Charter of the Dutch West India Company|charter]] for a trade monopoly in the [[West Indies]] (meaning the Caribbean) by the [[Republic of the Seven United Netherlands]] and given jurisdiction over the [[African slave trade]], Brazil, the [[Caribbean]], and North America. Its area of operations stretched from West Africa to the Americas, and the Pacific islands. The company became instrumental in the [[Dutch colonization of the Americas]]. The first forts and settlements in [[Guyana]] and on the [[Amazon River]] date from the 1590s. Actual colonization, with Dutch settling in the new lands, was not as common as with England and France. Many of the Dutch settlements were lost or abandoned by the end of that century, but the Netherlands managed to retain possession of [[Suriname]] and a number of Dutch Caribbean islands.\n\n[[File:Peter Stuyvesant.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Peter Stuyvesant]], Director-General of [[New Netherland]] (New York).

New Netherland was slowly settled during its first decades, partially as a result of policy mismanagement by the [[Dutch West India Company]] (WIC), and conflicts with Native Americans. During the 1650s, the colony experienced dramatic growth and became a major port for trade in the [[Atlantic World]], tolerating a highly diverse ethnic mix. The surrender of [[Fort Amsterdam]] to the British control in 1664 was formalized in 1667, contributing to the [[Second Anglo\u2013Dutch War]].

The marooned crew, the first Europeans to attempt settlement in the area, built a [[fort]] and stayed for a year until they were rescued. Shortly thereafter, the [[Dutch East India Company]] (in the Dutch of the day: ''Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie'', or VOC) decided to establish a permanent settlement. The VOC, one of the major European trading houses sailing the [[Spice trade|spice route]] to East Asia, had no intention of colonizing the area, instead wanting only to establish a secure base camp where passing ships could shelter, and where hungry sailors could stock up on fresh supplies of meat, fruit, and vegetables. To this end, a small VOC expedition under the command of [[Jan van Riebeeck]] reached [[Table Bay]] on 6 April 1652.<ref name=\"Noble-141\">{{Cite book|last=Noble|first=John|title=Illustrated Official Handbook of the Cape and South Africa; A r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the history, conditions, populations, productions and resources of the several colonies, states, and territories|publisher=J.C.

This arrangement proved highly successful, producing abundant supplies of fruit, vegetables, wheat, and wine; they also later raised livestock. The small initial group of \"free burghers\", as these farmers were known, steadily increased in number and began to expand their farms further north and east.\n\nThe majority of burghers had [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch ancestry]] and belonged to the [[Calvinist Reformed Church of the Netherlands]], but there were also numerous Germans as well as some Scandinavians. In 1688 the Dutch and the Germans were joined by French [[Huguenots]], also Calvinists, who were fleeing religious persecution in France under [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]]. The [[Huguenots in South Africa]] were absorbed into the Dutch population but they played a prominent role in South Africa's history.\n\nFrom the beginning, the VOC used the cape as a place to supply ships travelling between the Netherlands and the [[Dutch East Indies]]. There was a close association between the cape and these Dutch possessions in the far east. Van Riebeeck and the VOC began to import large numbers of slaves, primarily from [[Madagascar]] and [[Indonesia]]. These slaves often married Dutch settlers, and their descendants became known as the [[Cape Coloureds]] and the [[Cape Malays]].\n\n[[File:Aernout Smit Table Bay, 1683 William Fehr Collection Cape Town.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Table Bay|De Tafelbaai]] by Aernout Smit, 1683.]]\nDuring the 18th century, the Dutch settlement in the area of the cape grew and prospered. By the late 1700s, the [[Dutch Cape Colony|Cape Colony]] was one of the best developed European settlements outside Europe or the Americas.<ref name=\"Smith\">Smith, Adam (1776), [http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/adam-smith/Wealth-Nations.pdf Wealth of Nations] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020042323/http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/adam-smith/Wealth-Nations.pdf |date=20 October 2013 }}, Penn State Electronic Classics Edition, republished 2005, p. 516</ref> The two bases of the Cape Colony's economy for almost the entirety of its history were shipping and agriculture. Its strategic position meant that almost every ship sailing between Europe and Asia stopped off at the colony's capital [[Cape Town]]. The supplying of these ships with fresh provisions, fruit, and [[South African wine|wine]] provided a very large market for the surplus produce of the colony.<ref name=\"Smith\"/>\n\nSome free burghers continued to expand into the rugged hinterlands of the north and east, many began to take up a semi-nomadic [[pastoralism|pastoralist]] lifestyle, in some ways not far removed from that of the [[Khoikhoi]] they had displaced. In addition to its herds, a family might have a [[wagon]], a [[tent]], a Bible, and a few guns. As they became more settled, they would build a [[mud]]-walled [[cottage]], frequently located, by choice, days of travel from the nearest European settlement. These were the first of the [[Trekboer]]s (Wandering Farmers, later shortened to [[Boer]]s), completely independent of official controls, extraordinarily self-sufficient, and isolated from the government and the main settlement in [[Cape Town]].\n\n[[File:TrekBoers crossing the Karoo.jpg|thumb|left|200px|An account of the first [[trekboer]]s.]]\n[[Dutch language|Dutch]] was the official language, but a dialect had formed that was quite distinct from Dutch.

They seized the Cape Colony in 1795 to prevent it from falling into French hands, then briefly relinquished it back to the Dutch (1803), before definitively conquering it in 1806. British [[sovereignty]] of the area was recognised at the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815. By the time the Dutch colony was seized by the British in 1806, it had grown into an established settlement with 25,000 slaves, 20,000 white colonists, 15,000 [[Khoisan]], and 1,000 freed black slaves. Outside Cape Town and the immediate hinterland, isolated black and white [[pastoralists]] populated the country.\n\nDutch interest in South Africa was mainly as a strategically located VOC port. Yet in the 17th and 18th centuries the Dutch created the foundation of the modern state of South Africa. The Dutch legacy in South Africa is evident everywhere, but particularly in the [[Afrikaner]] people and the [[Afrikaans]] language.\n\n==Dutch Republic: Regents and Stadholders (1649\u20131784)==\n{{main|Dutch Republic}}\n[[File:Hendrick Avercamp - A Scene on the Ice - WGA01076.jpg|thumb|''Skating fun'', a traditional rural scene by 17th-century Dutch painter [[Hendrick Avercamp]].]]\n\nThe Netherlands gained independence from Spain as a result of the [[Eighty Years' War]], during which the Dutch Republic was founded. As the Netherlands was a republic, it was largely governed by an aristocracy of city-merchants called the [[Regenten|regents]], rather than by a king. Every city and province had its own government and laws, and a large degree of autonomy. After attempts to find a competent sovereign proved unsuccessful, it was decided that [[sovereignty]] would be vested in the various provincial Estates, the governing bodies of the provinces. The [[Estates-General of the Netherlands|Estates-General]], with its representatives from all the provinces, would decide on matters important to the Republic as a whole. However, at the head of each province was the [[stadtholder]] of that province, a position held by a descendant of the [[House of Orange-Nassau|House of Orange]]. Usually the stadtholdership of several provinces was held by a single man.\n\nAfter having gained its independence in 1648, the Netherlands tried in various coalitions to help to contain France, which had replaced Spain as the strongest nation of Europe. The end of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1713) marked the end of the Dutch Republic as a major player. In the 18th century, it just tried to maintain its independence and stuck to a policy of neutrality.\n\nThe economy, based on Amsterdam's role as the center of world trade, remained robust. In 1670 the Dutch merchant marine totalled 568,000 tons of shipping\u2014about half the European total.<ref>{{cite book|author=Tim William Blanning|title=The Pursuit of Glory: Europe, 1648\u20131815|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rmkcaEfwcsQC&pg=PA96|year=2007|publisher=Penguin|page=96|isbn=9780670063208}}</ref> The province of Holland was highly commercial and dominated the country.  Its nobility was small and closed and had little influence, for it was numerically small, politically weak, and formed a strictly closed caste. Most land in the province of Holland was commercialized for cash crops and was owned by urban capitalists, not nobles; there were few links between Holland's nobility and the merchants. By 1650 the burgher families which had grown wealthy through commerce and become influential in government controlled the province of Holland, and to a large extent shaped national policies. The other six provinces were more rural and traditional in life style, had an active nobility, and played a small role in commerce and national politics.  Instead they concentrated on their flood protections and land reclamation projects.<ref>{{cite book|author=E.H. Kossmann, \"The Dutch Republic,\" in F. L.

Many immigrants came to the cities of Holland in the 17th and 18th century from the Protestant parts of Germany and elsewhere. The amount of first generation immigrants from outside the Netherlands in Amsterdam was nearly 50% in the 17th and 18th centuries. Indeed, Amsterdam's population consisted primarily of immigrants, if one includes second and third generation immigrants and migrants from the Dutch countryside. People in most parts of Europe were poor and many were unemployed. But in Amsterdam there was always work. Tolerance was important, because a continuous influx of immigrants was necessary for the economy. Travellers visiting Amsterdam reported their surprise at the lack of control over the influx.\n\n===Economic growth===\n{{main|Economic history of the Netherlands (1500\u20131815)}}\nThe era of explosive economic growth is roughly coterminous with the period of social and cultural bloom that has been called the [[Dutch Golden Age]], and that actually formed the material basis for that cultural era.  Amsterdam became the hub of world trade, the center into which staples and luxuries flowed for sorting, processing, and distribution, and then reexported around Europe and the world.<ref>{{cite book|author=Joost Jonker|title=Merchants, bankers, middlemen: the Amsterdam money market during the first half of the 19th century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8xwWAQAAMAAJ|year=1996|publisher=NEHA|page=32|isbn=9789057420016}}</ref>\n\nDuring 1585 through 1622 there was the rapid accumulation of trade capital, often brought in by refugee merchantes from Antwerp and other ports.  The money was typically invested in high-risk ventures like pioneering expeditions to the [[East Indies]] to engage in the [[spice trade]]. These ventures were soon consolidated in the [[Dutch East India Company]] ('''VOC'''). There were similar ventures in different fields however, like the trade on Russia and the [[Levant]]. The profits of these ventures were ploughed back in the financing of new trade, which led to its exponential growth.<ref>Charles R. Boxer, ''The Dutch Seaborne Empire 1600\u20131800'' (1965)</ref>\n\nRapid industrialization led to the rapid growth of the nonagricultural labor force and the increase in real wages during the same time. In the half-century between 1570 and 1620 this labor supply increased 3 percent per annum, a truly phenomenal growth. Despite this, nominal wages were repeatedly increased, outstripping price increases. In consequence, real wages for unskilled laborers were 62 percent higher in 1615\u20131619 than in 1575\u20131579.<ref>Jan de Vries and A. van der Woude, ''The First Modern Economy.

The city contributed the largest quota in taxes to the States of Holland which in turn contributed over half the quota to the States General. Amsterdam was also one of the most reliable in settling tax demands and therefore was able to use the threat to withhold such payments to good effect.<ref>Regin, Deric, ''Traders, Artists, Burghers: A Cultural History of Amsterdam in the 17th century'' Van Gorcum, 1976, p. {{Page needed|date=October 2011}}</ref>\n\nAmsterdam was governed by a body of regents, a large, but closed, oligarchy with control over all aspects of the city's life, and a dominant voice in the foreign affairs of Holland. Only men with sufficient wealth and a long enough residence within the city could join the ruling class. The first step for an ambitious and wealthy merchant family was to arrange a marriage with a long-established regent family. In the 1670s one such union, that of the Trip family (the Amsterdam branch of the Swedish arms makers) with the son of Burgomaster Valckenier, extended the influence and patronage available to the latter and strengthened his dominance of the council. The oligarchy in Amsterdam thus gained strength from its breadth and openness. In the smaller towns family interest could unite members on policy decisions but contraction through intermarriage could lead to the degeneration of the quality of the members.\n\nIn Amsterdam the network was so large that members of the same family could be related to opposing factions and pursue widely separated interests.  The young men who had risen to positions of authority in the 1670s and 1680s consolidated their hold on office well into the 1690s and even the new century.<ref>Edwards, Elizabeth, \"Amsterdam and William III,\" ''History Today,'' (Dec 1993), Vol. 43, Issue 12 pp. 25\u201331</ref>\n\nAmsterdam's regents provided good services to residents. They spent heavily on the water-ways and other essential infrastructure, as well as municipal almshouses for the elderly, hospitals and churches.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Elise Van Nederveen Meerkerk|author2=Griet Vermeesch|title=Serving the Urban Community: The Rise of Public Facilities in the Low Countries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GyqI-UjSTy8C&pg=PA158|year=2010|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|page=158|isbn=9789052603506}}</ref>\n\nAmsterdam's wealth was generated by its commerce, which was in turn sustained by the judicious encouragement of entrepreneurs whatever their origin. This open door policy has been interpreted as proof of a tolerant ruling class. But toleration was practiced for the convenience of the city. Therefore, the wealthy Sephardic Jews from Portugal were welcomed and accorded all privileges except those of citizenship, but the poor Ashkenazi Jews from Eastern Europe were far more carefully vetted and those who became dependent on the city were encouraged to move on.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Paolo Bernardini|author2=Norman Fiering|title=The Jews and the Expansion of Europe to the West, 1400\u20131800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m0JAGMuePO0C&pg=PA372|year=2004|publisher=Berghahn Books|page=372|isbn=9781571814302}}</ref> Similarly, provision for the housing of Huguenot immigrants was made in 1681 when [[Louis XIV]]'s religious policy was beginning to drive these Protestants out of France; no encouragement was given to the dispossessed Dutch from the countryside or other towns of Holland.

The former\u2014the Orangists\u2014were soldiers and centralizers who seldom spoke of compromise with the enemy and looked for military solutions.

The regents seized the opportunity: there would be no new stadtholder in Holland for 22 years. [[Johan de Witt]], a brilliant politician and diplomat, emerged as the dominant figure.  Princes of Orange became the stadtholder and an almost hereditary ruler in 1672 and 1748. The Dutch Republic of the United Provinces was a true republic from 1650 to 1672 and 1702\u20131748.

King Charles thought a naval war would weaken the Dutch traders and strengthen the English economy and empire, so the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] was launched in 1665. At first many Dutch ships were captured and the English scored great victories.  However, the [[Raid on the Medway]], in June 1667, ended the war with a Dutch victory.

France, Cologne and M\u00fcnster invaded the Republic. Johan de Witt and his brother Cornelis, who had accomplished a diplomatic balancing act for a long time, were now the obvious scapegoats. They were lynched, and a new [[stadtholder]], William III, was appointed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Johan-De-Witt|title=Johan De Witt|date=20 September 2018|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|access-date=20 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nAn Anglo-French attempt to land on the Dutch shore was barely repelled in three desperate naval battles under command of [[Admiral (Netherlands)|Admiral]] [[Michiel de Ruyter]]. The advance of French troops from the south was halted by a costly inundation of its own heartland, by breaching river dikes. With the aid of friendly German princes, the Dutch succeeded in fighting back [[Cologne]] and [[M\u00fcnster]], after which the peace was signed with both of them, although some territory in the east was lost forever. Peace was signed with England as well, in 1674 ([[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Second Treaty of Westminster]]). In 1678, peace was made with France at the [[Treaty of Nijmegen]], although France's Spanish and German allies felt betrayed by this.\n\nIn 1688, the relations with England reached crisis level once again. Stadtholder [[William III of England|William III]] decided he had to take a huge gamble when he was invited to invade England by Protestant British nobles feuding with William's father-in-law the Catholic [[James II of England]]. This led to the [[Glorious Revolution]] and cemented the principle of parliamentary rule and Protestant ascendency in England.  James fled to France, and William ascended to the English throne as co-monarch with his wife Mary, James' eldest daughter.  This manoeuvre secured England as a critical ally of the United Provinces in its ongoing wars with [[Louis XIV of France]].  William was the commander of the Dutch and English armies and fleets until his death in 1702.  During William's reign as King of England, his primary focus was leveraging British manpower and finances to aid the Dutch against the French.  The combination continued after his death as the combined Dutch, British, and mercenary army conquered Flanders and Brabant, and invaded French territory before the alliance collapsed in 1713 due to British political infighting.\n\n===Second Stadtholderless Period (1702\u20131747)===\n{{main| Second Stadtholderless Period}}\n[[File:Cornelis Troost02.jpg|thumb|The Inspectors of the Collegium Medicum in Amsterdam, by [[Cornelis Troost]], 1724. This period is known as the \"Periwig Era\".]]\n\nThe ''Second Stadtholderless Period'' ({{lang-nl|Tweede Stadhouderloze Tijdperk}}) is the designation in Dutch [[historiography]] of the period between the death of [[stadtholder]] [[William III of England|William III]] on 19 March<ref>This is the date from the [[Gregorian calendar]] that was followed at the time in the Dutch Republic; according to the [[Julian calendar]], still used in England at the time, the date of death was 8 March.</ref> 1702 and the appointment of [[William IV, Prince of Orange]] as stadtholder and captain general in all provinces of the [[Dutch Republic]] on 2 May 1747. During this period the office of stadtholder was left vacant in the provinces of [[Holland]], [[Zeeland]], and [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]], though in other provinces that office was filled by members of the House of Nassau-Dietz (later called Orange-Nassau) during various periods.\n\nDuring the period, the Republic lost its Great-Power status and its primacy in world trade, processes that went hand-in-hand, the latter causing the former. Though the economy declined considerably, causing deindustralization and deurbanization in the maritime provinces, a ''rentier''-class kept accumulating a large capital fund that formed the basis for the leading position the Republic achieved in the international capital market. A military crisis at the end of the period caused the fall of the [[Dutch States Party|States-Party regime]] and the restoration of the Stadtholderate in all provinces. However, though the new stadtholder acquired near-dictatorial powers, this did not improve the situation.\n\n===Economic decline after 1730===\nThe slow economic decline after 1730 was relative: other countries grew faster, eroding the Dutch lead and surpassing it. Wilson identifies three causes. Holland lost its world dominance in trade as competitors emerged and copied its practices, built their own ships and ports, and traded on their own account directly without going through Dutch intermediaries. Second, there was no growth in manufacturing, due perhaps to a weaker sense of industrial entrepreneurship and to the high wage scale. Third the wealthy turned their investments to foreign loans. This helped jump-start other nations and provided the Dutch with a steady income from collecting interest, but leaving them with few domestic sectors with a potential for rapid growth.<ref>C. H. Wilson, \"The Economic Decline of the Netherlands,\" ''Economic History Review'' (1939) 9#2 pp. 111\u2013127, esp. p. 113  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2590218 in JSTOR]</ref><ref>Israel, ''Dutch Republic'', pp. 999\u20131018</ref>\n\nAfter the Dutch fleet declined, merchant interests became dependent on the goodwill of Britain. The main focus of Dutch leaders was reducing the country's considerable budget deficits. Dutch trade and shipping remained at a fairly steady level through the 18th century, but no longer had a near monopoly and also could not match growing English and French competition. The Netherlands lost its position as the trading centre of Northern Europe to London.\n\nAlthough the Netherlands remained wealthy, investors for the nation's money became more difficult to find. Some investment went into purchases of land for estates, but most went to foreign bonds and Amsterdam remained one of Europe's banking capitals.\n\n===Culture and society===\nDutch culture also declined both in the arts and sciences. Literature for example largely imitated English and French styles with little in the way of innovation or originality.  The most influential intellectual was [[Pierre Bayle]] (1647\u20131706), a Protestant refugee from France who settled in Rotterdam where he wrote the massive [[Dictionnaire Historique et Critique]] (''Historical and Critical Dictionary'', 1696). It had a major impact on the thinking of [[The Enlightenment]] across Europe, giving an arsenal of weapons to critics who wanted to attack religion. It was an encyclopaedia of ideas that argued that most \"truths\" were merely opinions, and that gullibility and stubbornness were prevalent.<ref>Thomas M. Lennon and Michael Hickson, \"Pierre Bayle,\" ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (2012) [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bayle/ online]</ref>\n\nLife for the average Dutchman became slower and more relaxed than in the 18th century. The upper and middle classes continued to enjoy prosperity and high living standards. The drive to succeed seemed less urgent. Unskilled laborers remained locked in poverty and hardship. The large underclass of unemployed beggars and riffraff required government and private charity to survive.\n\nReligious life became more relaxed as well. Catholics grew from 18% to 23% of the population during the 18th century and enjoyed greater tolerance, even as they continued to be outside the political system. They became divided by the feud between moralistic Jansenists (who denied free will) and orthodox believers. One group of Jansenists formed a splinter sect, the [[Old Catholic Church]] in 1723. The upper classes willingly embraced the ideas of the Enlightenment, tempered by the tolerance that meant less hostility to organized religion compared to France.<ref>Israel, ''Dutch Republic'', pp. 1021, 1033\u201336</ref>\n\n===The Orangist revolution (1747\u20131751)===\n{{Main|Second Stadtholderless Period}}\n[[File:StadhouderWillemIV(4).jpg|thumb|left|[[William IV, Prince of Orange]], stadholder from 1747 to 1751 CE.]]\n[[File:Willem v (2).jpg|thumb|left|[[Willem V of Orange]], stadholder from 1751 to 1806, and [[Wilhelmina of Prussia, Princess of Orange|Wilhelmina of Prussia]] with three of their five children. From left to right: the future [[William I of the Netherlands]], Frederick, and Frederica Louise Wilhelmina.]]\n\nDuring the term of [[Anthonie van der Heim]] as [[Grand Pensionary]] from 1737 to 1746, the Republic slowly drifted into the [[War of Austrian Succession]]. This started as a Prusso-Austrian conflict, but eventually all the neighbours of the [[Dutch Republic]] became involved. On one side were Prussia, France and their allies and on the other Austria, Britain (after 1744) and their allies. At first the Republic strove to remain neutral in this European conflict, but it maintained garrisons in a number of fortresses in the [[Austrian Netherlands]]. French grievances and threats spurred the Republic into bring its army up to European standards (84,000 men in 1743).<ref name=\"Israel\">Israel, Jonathan ''The Dutch Republic: Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall 1477\u20131806'' (\"Oxford\" Oxford U.P. 1998)  pp. 996\u201397, 1069\u201387</ref>\n\nIn 1744 and 1745 the French attacked Dutch fortresses at [[Menen]] and [[Tournai]]. This prompted the [[Dutch Republic]] in 1745 to join the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance|Quadruple Alliance]], but this alliance was severely defeated at the [[Battle of Fontenoy]] in May 1745. In 1746 the French occupied most of the large cities in the [[Austrian Netherlands]]. Then, in April 1747, apparently as an exercise in armed diplomacy, a relatively small French military force occupied [[Zeelandic Flanders]], part of the Dutch Republic.<ref name=\"Israel\"/>\n\nThis relatively innocuous invasion fully exposed the rot underlying the Dutch defences.  The consequences were spectacular.  Still mindful of the French invasion in the [[Rampjaar|\"Disaster Year\" of 1672]], many fearful people clamored for the restoration of the stadtholderate.<ref name=Israel/> [[William IV, Prince of Orange]], had been waiting impatiently in the wings since acquiring his princely title in 1732.  Over the next year he and his supporters engaged in a number of political battles in various provinces and towns in the Netherlands to wrest control from the [[regenten|regents]]. The aim was for William IV to obtain a firm grip on government patronage and place loyal officials in all strategic government positions. Eventually he managed to achieve this aim in all provinces.<ref name=Israel/>\n\n[[Willem Bentinck van Rhoon]] was a prominent Orangist. People like Bentinck hoped that gathering the reins of power in the hands of a single \"eminent head\" would soon help restore the state of the Dutch economy and finances. The regents they opposed included the Grand Pensionary [[Jacob Gilles]] and Adriaen van der Hoop. This popular revolt had religious, anti-Catholic and democratic overtones and sometimes involved mob violence. It eventually involved political agitation by [[Daniel Raap]], [[Jean Rousset de Missy]] and the [[Doelisten]], attacks on [[Tax farming|tax farmers]] ([[pachtersoproer]]), religious agitation for enforcement of the Sabbath laws and preference for followers of [[Gisbertus Voetius]] and various demands by the civil militia.<ref name=Israel/>\n\nThe war against the French was itself brought to a not-too-devastating end for the [[Dutch Republic]] with the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)]]. The French retreated of their own accord from the Dutch frontier. William IV died unexpectedly, at the age of 40, on 22 October 1751.<ref name=Israel/>\n\n===Regency and indolent rule (1752\u20131779)===\nHis son, [[William V, Prince of Orange|William V]], was 3 years old when his father died, and a long regency characterised by corruption and misrule began. His mother delegated most of the powers of the regency to Bentinck and her favorite, [[Duke Louis Ernest of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]]. All power was concentrated in the hands of an unaccountable few, including the Frisian nobleman [[Douwe Sirtema van Grovestins]].<ref name=Israel/> Still a teenager, William V assumed the position of [[stadtholder]] in 1766, the last to hold that office. In 1767, he married [[Wilhelmina of Prussia, Princess of Orange|Princess Wilhelmina of Prussia]], the daughter of [[Prince Augustus William of Prussia|Augustus William of Prussia]], niece of [[Frederick the Great]].\n\nThe position of the Dutch during the [[American War of Independence]] was one of [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]]. William V, leading the pro-British faction within the government, blocked attempts by pro-independence, and later pro-French, elements to drag the government to war. However, things came to a head with the Dutch attempt to join the Russian-led [[First League of Armed Neutrality|League of Armed Neutrality]], leading to the outbreak of the disastrous [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War]] in 1780. After the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], the impoverished nation grew restless under William's rule.\n\nAn English historian summed him up uncharitably as \"a Prince of the profoundest lethargy and most abysmal stupidity.\"<ref>Fulford, Roger ''Royal Dukes'' William Collins and Son London 1933</ref> And yet he would guide his family through the difficult French-Batavian period and his son would be crowned king.\n\n===Fourth Anglo-Dutch War (1780\u20131784)===\n{{Main|Fourth Anglo-Dutch War}}\n[[File:The Battle of the Dogger Bank 5 August 1781.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Dogger Bank (1781)]] by [[Thomas Luny]].]]\nThe [[Fourth Anglo\u2013Dutch War]] (1780\u20131784) was a conflict between the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and the [[Dutch Republic]]. The war, tangentially related to the [[American Revolutionary War]], broke out over British and Dutch disagreements on the legality and conduct of Dutch trade with Britain's enemies in that war.\n\nAlthough the Dutch Republic did not enter into a formal alliance with the United States and their allies, U.S. ambassador (and future President) [[John Adams]] managed to establish diplomatic relations with the Dutch Republic, making it the second European country to diplomatically recognize the [[Continental Congress]] in April 1782. In October 1782, a treaty of amity and commerce was concluded as well.\n\nMost of the war consisted of a series of largely successful British operations against Dutch colonial economic interests, although British and Dutch naval forces also [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1781)|met once off the Dutch coast]].  The war ended disastrously for the Dutch and exposed the weakness of the political and economic foundations of the country.<ref>Edler, Friedrich, ''The Dutch Republic and The American Revolution'' (1911, reprinted 2001) Honolulu, Hawaii: University Press of the Pacific, p. 88</ref> The [[Treaty of Paris (1784)]], according to [[Fernand Braudel]], \"sounded the knell of Dutch greatness.\"<ref>[[Fernand Braudel|Braudel, Fernand]], ''The Perspective of the World'' vol.

The [[French Revolution]] resulted first in the establishment of a pro-French [[Batavian Republic]] (1795\u20131806), then the creation of the [[Kingdom of Holland]], ruled by a member of the [[House of Bonaparte]] (1806\u20131810), and finally annexation by the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] (1810\u20131813).\n\n===Patriot rebellion and its suppression (1785\u20131795)===\n{{main|Batavian Revolution}}\n[[File:Jonas Zeuner - Vuurgevecht aan de Vaartse Rijn.jpg|thumb|Firefight on the [[Vaartse Rijn]] at [[Jutphaas]] on 9 May 1787. The pro-revolutionary Utrecht [[Patriots (Dutch Republic)|Patriots]] are on the right; the troops of [[stadholder]] [[William V, Prince of Orange]] on the left. (Painted by Jonas Zeuner, 1787)]]\n\nInfluenced by the [[American Revolution]], the [[Patriots (Dutch Republic)|Patriots]] sought a more democratic form of government. The opening shot of this revolution is often considered to be the 1781 publication of a manifesto called ''[[Aan het Volk van Nederland]]'' (\"To the People of the Netherlands\") by [[Joan van der Capellen tot den Pol]], who would become an influential leader of the Patriot movement. Their aim was to reduce corruption and the power held by the [[stadtholder]], [[William V, Prince of Orange]].\n\nSupport for the Patriots came mostly from the middle class. They formed [[militia]]s called ''[[exercitiegenootschap]]pen''. In 1785, there was an open Patriot rebellion, which took the form of an armed insurrection by local militias in certain Dutch towns, ''Freedom'' being the rallying cry. [[Herman Willem Daendels]] attempted to organise an overthrow of various municipal governments ([[vroedschap]]). The goal was to oust government officials and force new elections. \"Seen as a whole this revolution was a string of violent and confused events, accidents, speeches, rumours, bitter enmities and armed confrontations\", wrote French historian [[Fernand Braudel]], who saw it as a forerunner of the [[French Revolution]].\n\nIn 1785 [[William V, Prince of Orange|the stadholder]] left The Hague and moved his court to [[Nijmegen]] in [[Guelders]], a city remote from the heart of Dutch political life. In June 1787, his energetic wife [[Wilhelmina of Prussia, Princess of Orange|Wilhelmina]] (the sister of [[Frederick William II of Prussia]]) tried to travel to [[The Hague]]. Outside [[Schoonhoven]], she was stopped by Patriot militiamen and taken to a farm near [[Goejanverwellesluis]]. Within two days she was forced to return to Nijmegen, an insult not unnoticed in Prussia.\n\nThe House of Orange reacted with severity, relying on [[Prussia]]n troops led by [[Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick]] and a small contingent of British troops to [[Prussian invasion of Holland|suppress the rebellion]]. Dutch banks at this time still held much of the world's [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. Government-sponsored banks owned up to 40% of Great Britain's [[national debt]] and there were close connections to the [[House of Stuart]]. The stadholder had supported British policies after the [[American Revolution]].\n\nThis severe military response overwhelmed the Patriots and put the stadholder firmly back in control. A small unpaid Prussian army was billeted in the Netherlands and supported themselves by looting and extortion. The exercitiegenootschappen continued urging citizens to resist the government. They distributed pamphlets, formed \"Patriot Clubs\" and held public [[Demonstration (people)|demonstration]]s. The government responded by pillaging those towns where opposition continued. Five leaders were sentenced to death (but fled first). Lynchings also occurred. For a while, no one dared appear in public without an orange cockade to show their support for [[Orangism (Netherlands)|Orangism]]. Many Patriots, perhaps around 40,000 in all, fled to Brabant, France (especially [[Dunkirk]] and [[Saint-Omer|St. Omer]]) and elsewhere. However, before long the French became involved in Dutch politics and the tide turned.\n\n===Batavian Republic (1795\u20131806)===\n{{Main|Batavian Republic}}\n[[File:Vrijheidsboom.jpg|left|thumb|Liberty tree erected in Dam Square in Amsterdam, 1795 by H. Numan.]]\nThe [[French Revolution]] was popular, and numerous underground clubs were promoting it when in January 1795 the [[Flanders Campaign|French army invaded]]. The underground rose up, overthrew the municipal and provincial governments, and proclaimed the [[Batavian Republic]] ({{lang-nl|Bataafse Republiek}}) [[Batavian Revolution in Amsterdam|in Amsterdam]]. Stadtholder William V fled to England and the States General dissolved itself. The new government was virtually a puppet of France.<ref>C. Cook & J. Stevenson, ''The routledge companion to European history since 1763'' (Abingdon: Routledge, 2005), p. 66; J. Dunn, ''Democracy: A history'' (NY: Atlantic Books, 2005), p. 86.</ref>  The Batavian Republic enjoyed widespread support and sent soldiers to fight in the French armies. The 1799 [[Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland]] was repulsed by Batavian\u2013French forces. Nevertheless, Napoleon replaced it because the regime of [[Grand Pensionary]] [[Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck]] (1805\u201306) was insufficiently docile.<ref>[[R.R. Palmer|Palmer, R.R.]] \"Much in Little: The Dutch Revolution of 1795,\" ''Journal of Modern History'' (1954) 26#1 pp. 15\u201335 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1874870 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nThe confederal structure of the old Dutch Republic was permanently replaced by a unitary state.  The 1798 constitution had a genuinely democratic character, though a coup d'\u00e9tat of 1801 put an authoritarian regime in power. Ministerial government was introduced for the first time in Dutch history and many of the current government departments date their history back to this period.  Meanwhile, the exiled stadholder [[Kew Letters|handed over the Dutch colonies]] in \"safekeeping\" to Great Britain and ordered the colonial governors to comply.  This permanently ended the colonial empire in Guyana, Ceylon and the Cape Colony. The Dutch East Indies was returned to the Netherlands under the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814]].\n\n===Kingdom of Holland to William I (1806\u20131815)===\n[[File:France L-2 (1812)-fr.svg|thumb|Administrative divisions of the [[First French Empire]] in 1812, illustrating the incorporation of the Netherlands and its internal reorganisation.]]\n{{Main|Kingdom of Holland}}\n\nIn 1806 Napoleon restyled the Netherlands (along with a small part of what is now Germany) into the [[Kingdom of Holland]], putting his brother [[Louis Bonaparte]] (1778\u20131846), on the throne. The new king was unpopular, but he was willing to cross his brother for the benefit of his new kingdom. Napoleon forced his abdication in 1810 and incorporated the Netherlands directly into the [[First French Empire|French empire]], imposing economic controls and conscription of all young men as soldiers. When the French retreated from the northern provinces in 1813, a [[Driemanschap|Triumvirate]] took over at the helm of a [[Sovereign Principality of the United Netherlands|provisional government]].  Although most members of the provisional government had been among the men who had driven out William V 18 years earlier, the leaders of the provisional government knew that any new regime would have to be headed by his son, William Frederick.  They also knew that it would be better in the long term if the Dutch people themselves installed the prince, rather than have him imposed on the country by the anti-French alliance.  Accordingly, the Triumvirate called William Frederick back on 30 November and offered him the crown.  He refused, but instead proclaimed himself \"[[Sovereign Principality of the United Netherlands|hereditary sovereign prince]]\" on 6 December.\n\nThe [[Great Powers]] had [[Eight Articles of London|secretly agreed]] to merge the northern Netherlands with the more populated [[Austrian Netherlands]] and the smaller [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge]] into a single constitutional monarchy.  Having a stronger country on France's northern border was considered (especially by [[Alexander I of Russia|Tsar Alexander]]) to be an important part of the strategy to keep France's power in check.  In 1814, William Frederick gained sovereignty over the Austrian Netherlands and Li\u00e8ge as well. Thus, William Frederick had fulfilled his family's three-century quest to unite the Low Countries under a single rule.\n\nOn 15 March 1815; with the encouragement of the powers gathered at the [[Congress of Vienna]], William Frederick raised the Netherlands to the status of a kingdom and proclaimed himself [[William I of the Netherlands|King William I]].  This was made official later in 1815, when the Low Countries were formally recognized as the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. The crown was made a hereditary office of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]].\n\n==United Kingdom of the Netherlands (1815\u20131839)==\n{{Main|United Kingdom of the Netherlands|Dutch monarchy}}\n[[File:LandingWillemI.jpg|thumb|left|''Landing of the future king [[William I of the Netherlands|William I]] at Scheveningen on 30 November 1813'' by Johan Willem Heyting (1915\u20131995).]]\n[[William I of the Netherlands|William I]] became king and also became the hereditary [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg]], that was part of the Netherlands but at the same time part of the German Confederation. The newly created country had two capitals: [[Amsterdam]] and [[Brussels]]. The new nation had two equal parts. The north (Netherlands proper) had 2 million people. They spoke chiefly Dutch but were divided religiously between a Protestant majority and a large Catholic minority. The south (which would be known as \"Belgium\" after 1830) had a population of 3.4&nbsp;million people. Nearly all were Catholic, but it was divided between French-speaking Walloons and Dutch-speaking Flemings. The upper and middle classes in the south were mostly French-speaking. About 60,000 Belgians were eligible to vote, compared to about 80,000 Dutchmen.  Officially Amsterdam was the capital, but in a compromise the government met alternately in Brussels and The Hague.<ref>Kossmann, ''Low Countries'' p 112\u201333</ref>\n\n[[Adolphe Quetelet]] (1796\u20131874), the great Belgian statistician, calculated that the new nation was significantly better off than other states. Mortality was low, the food supply was good, education was good, public awareness was high and the charity rate was the highest in the world. The best years were in the mid-1820s.<ref>Kossmann, ''Low Countries'' p 115\u201316</ref>\n\nThe quality of schooling was dismal, however. According to Schama, about 1800 the local school teacher was the \"humble auxiliary of the local priest. Despised by his co-villagers and forced to subsist on the gleanings of the peasants, he combined drumming the catechism into the heads of his unruly charges with the duties of winding the town clock, ringing the church bells or digging its graves. His principal use to the community was to keep its boys out of mischief when there was no labour for them in the fields, or setting the destitute orphans of the town to the 'useful arts' of picking tow or spinning crude flax. As one would expect, standards in such an occupation were dismal.\"<ref>Simon Schama, \"The Rights of Ignorance: Dutch Educational Policy in Belgium 1815\u201330,\" ''History of Education'' (1972) 1:1, pp. 81\u201389 [https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0046760720010106 link]</ref> But in 1806 the Dutch, led by Adriaan van den Ende, energetically set out to modernise education, focusing on a new system for advanced training of teachers with an elaborate system of inspectors, training courses, teacher examinations and teaching societies.  By 1826, although much smaller than France, the Dutch national government was spending 12 times more than Paris on education.<ref>Schama, \"The Rights of Ignorance: Dutch Educational Policy in Belgium 1815\u201330,\" pp. 84\u201385</ref>\n\n===Constitutional monarchy===\n[[File:Vereinigteskoenigreich.png|thumb|left|'''The [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]] and [[Duchy of Limburg (1839\u20131867)|Limburg]] in 1839'''<br>'''1''', '''2''' and '''3''' United Kingdom of the Netherlands (until 1830)<br>'''1''' and '''2''' [[Netherlands|Kingdom of the Netherlands]] (after 1830)<br>'''2''' [[Duchy of Limburg (1839\u20131867)]] (in the German Confederacy after 1839 as compensation for Waals-Luxemburg)<br>'''3''' and '''4''' [[Belgium|Kingdom of Belgium]] (after 1839)<br>'''4''' and '''5''' [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]] (borders until 1839) <br>'''4''' [[Luxembourg (province)|Province of Luxembourg]] (Waals-Luxemburg, to Belgium in 1839)<br>'''5''' [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]] (German Luxemburg; borders after 1839)<br>In blue, the borders of the [[German Confederation]].]]\n\nWilliam I, who reigned from 1815 to 1840, had great constitutional power. An [[enlightened despot]], he accepted the modernizing transformations of the previous 25 years, including equality of all before the law. However, he resurrected the [[Estates of the realm|estates]] as a political class and elevated a large number of people to the nobility. Voting rights were still limited, and only the nobility were eligible for seats in the upper house. The old provinces were reestablished in name only. The government was now fundamentally unitary, and all authority flowed from the center.\n\nWilliam I was a Calvinist and unsympathetic to the religious culture and practices of the Catholic majority.  He promulgated the \"Fundamental Law of Holland\", with some modifications. This entirely overthrew the old order of things in the southern Netherlands: it abolished the privileges of the Catholic Church, and guaranteed equal protection to every religious creed and the enjoyment of the same civil and political rights to every subject of the king. It reflected the spirit of the French Revolution and in so doing did not please the Catholic bishops in the south, who had detested the Revolution.<ref>Godefroid Kurth, \"Belgium\" in [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02395a.htm ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1907) online]</ref>\n\nWilliam I actively promoted economic modernization. The first 15 years of the Kingdom showed progress and prosperity, as industrialization proceeded rapidly in the south, where the [[Industrial Revolution]] allowed entrepreneurs and labor to combine in a new textile industry, powered by local coal mines. There was little industry in the northern provinces, but most overseas colonies were restored, and highly profitable trade resumed after a 25-year hiatus. Economic liberalism combined with moderate monarchical authoritarianism to accelerate the adaptation of the Netherlands to the new conditions of the 19th century. The country prospered until a crisis arose in relations with the southern provinces.\n\n===Belgium breaks away===\n{{main|Belgian Revolution}}\nWilliam was determined to create a united people, even though the north and south had drifted far apart in the past three centuries. Protestants were the largest denomination in the North (population 2 million), but formed a quarter of the population in the overwhelmingly Catholic South (population 3.5&nbsp;million). Nevertheless, Protestants dominated William's government and army. The Catholics did not consider themselves an integral part of the United Netherlands, preferring instead to identify with mediaeval Dutch culture. Other factors that contributed to this feeling were economic (the South was industrialising, the North had always been a merchants' nation) and linguistic (French was spoken in [[Wallonia]] and a large part of the bourgeoisie in Flemish cities).{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nAfter having been dominant for centuries, the French-speaking elite in the Southern Netherlands now felt like second-class citizens.\nIn the Catholic South,<ref>see [http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/lowcountries/neth18151830.html online maps 1830, 1839]</ref> William's policies were unpopular. The French-speaking Walloons strenuously rejected his attempt to make Dutch the universal language of government, while the population of [[Flanders]] was divided. Flemings in the south spoke a Dutch dialect (\"Flemish\") and welcomed the encouragement of Dutch with a revival of literature and popular culture. Other Flemings, notably the educated bourgeoisie, preferred to speak French. Although Catholics possessed legal equality, they resented their subordination to a government that was fundamentally Protestant in spirit and membership after having been the state church for centuries in the south. Few Catholics held high office in state or army. Furthermore, political liberals in the south complained about the king's authoritarian methods. All southerners complained of underrepresentation in the national legislature. Although the south was industrializing and was more prosperous than the north the accumulated grievances allowed the multiple opposition forces to coalesce. \n[[File:R\u00e9volution belge de 1830 - La rue de Flandre le jeudi 23 septembre 1830.jpg|thumb|Fighting between Belgian rebels and the Dutch military expedition in [[Brussels]] in September 1830]]\nThe outbreak of [[July Revolution|revolution in France]] in 1830 was a signal for action, at first on behalf of autonomy for Belgium, as the southern provinces were now called, and later on behalf of total independence. William dithered and his half-hearted efforts to reconquer Belgium were thwarted both by the efforts of the Belgians themselves and by the diplomatic opposition of the great powers.\n\nAt the [[London Conference of 1830]], the chief powers of Europe ordered (in November 1830) an armistice between the Dutch and the Belgians. The first draft for a treaty of separation of Belgium and the Netherlands was rejected by the Belgians. A second draft (June 1831) was rejected by William I, who resumed hostilities. Franco-British intervention forced William to withdraw Dutch forces from Belgium late in 1831, and in 1833 an armistice of indefinite duration was concluded. Belgium was effectively independent but William's attempts to recover Luxembourg and Limburg led to renewed tension. The London Conference of 1838\u201339 prepared the final Dutch-Belgian [[Treaty of London (1839)|separation treaty of 1839]]. It divided Luxembourg and Limburg between the Dutch and Belgian crowns. The Kingdom of the Netherlands thereafter was made up of the 11 northern provinces.<ref>{{cite book|first = J. C.

Griffiths argues that certain government policies facilitated the emergence of a national economy in the 19th century. They included the abolition of internal tariffs and guilds, a unified coinage system, modern methods of tax collection, standardized weights and measures, and the building of many roads, canals, and railroads.  However, compared to Belgium, which was leading in industrialization on the Continent, the Netherlands moved slowly. Possible explanations for this difference are the higher costs due to geography and high wages, and the emphasis of entrepreneurs on trade rather than industry.<ref>Richard T. Griffiths, ''Industrial Retardation in the Netherlands, 1830\u20131850'' (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1979).</ref>\nFor example, in the Dutch coastal provinces agricultural productivity was relatively high. Hence, industrial growth arrived relatively late \u2013 after 1860 \u2013 because incentives to move to labour-intensive industry were quite weak.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

The number of people employed in agriculture decreased, while the country made a strong effort to revive its stake in the highly competitive shipping and trade business. The Netherlands lagged behind Belgium until the late 19th century in industrialization, and caught up around 1920. Major industries included textiles and (later) the great Philips industrial conglomerate. Rotterdam became a major shipping and manufacturing center.<ref>{{cite book|author=Loyen, Reginald|title=Struggling for Leadership: Antwerp-Rotterdam Port.

Born in [[Zundert|Groot-Zundert]], van Gogh was a Dutch post-Impressionist painter whose work, notable for its rough beauty, emotional honesty and bold color, had a far-reaching influence on [[20th-century art]].]]\n\nIn 1840 William I abdicated in favor of his son, [[William II of the Netherlands|William II]], who attempted to carry on the policies of his father in the face of a powerful liberal movement. In 1848 [[Revolutions of 1848|unrest broke out all over Europe]]. Although there were no major events in the Netherlands, these foreign developments persuaded King [[William II of the Netherlands|William II]] to agree to liberal and democratic reform. That same year [[Johan Rudolf Thorbecke]], a prominent liberal, was asked by the king to draft a constitution that would turn the Netherlands into a [[constitutional monarchy]]. The new constitution was proclaimed on 3 November 1848. It severely limited the king's powers (making the government accountable only to an elected parliament), and it protected [[civil liberties]]. The new liberal constitution, which put the government under the control of the States General, was accepted by the legislature in 1848.  The relationship between monarch, government and parliament has remained essentially unchanged ever since.\n\nWilliam II was succeeded by [[William III of the Netherlands|William III]] in 1849. The new king reluctantly chose Thorbecke to head the new government, which introduced several liberal measures, notably the extension of suffrage. However, Thorbecke's government soon fell, when Protestants rioted against the Vatican's reestablishment of the Catholic episcopate, in abeyance since the 16th century. A conservative government was formed, but it did not undo the liberal measures, and the Catholics were finally given equality after two centuries of subordination. Dutch political history from the middle of the 19th century until the [[First World War]] was fundamentally one of the extension of liberal reforms in government, the reorganization and modernization of the Dutch economy, and the rise of trade unionism and socialism as working-class movements independent of traditional liberalism.  The growth in prosperity was enormous, as real per capita GNP soared from 106 guilders in 1804 to 403 in 1913.<ref>E. H. Kossmann, ''The Low Countries 1780\u20131940'' (1978) ch 5</ref>\n\n===Religion and pillarisation===\n[[File:Nederlandgodsdienst1849.PNG|thumb|Religion in the Netherlands in 1849.\n{{legend|#008000|[[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]]}}\n{{legend|#FF0000|[[Protestantism]] ([[Calvinism|Calvinist]])}}]]\nReligion was a contentious issue with repeated struggles over the relations of church and state in the field of education. In 1816, the government took full control of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] (''Nederlands Hervormde Kerk''). In 1857, all religious instruction was ended in public schools, but the various churches set up their own schools, and even universities. Dissident members broke away from the Dutch Reformed Church in the Secession of 1834. They were harassed by the government under an onerous Napoleonic law prohibiting gatherings of more than 20 members without a permit. After the harassment ended in the 1850s, a number of these dissidents eventually created the Christian Reformed Church in 1869; thousands migrated to Michigan, Illinois, and Iowa in the United States. By 1900, the dissidents represented about 10% of the population, compared to 45% of the population who were in the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], which continued to be the only church to receive state money.<ref>Corwin, \"Holland\" [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/encyc05.h.ix.html  ''The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge,'' (1914) 5:319\u201322]</ref>\n\nAt mid-century, most Dutch belonged either to the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] or dissenter groups that separated from it (around 55%), or the [[Roman Catholic Church]] (35% to 40%), together with smaller [[Protestant]] (for example, [[Lutheran]]) and Jewish groups. A large and powerful sector of nominal Protestants were in fact secular liberals seeking to minimize religious influence. In reaction a novel alliance developed with Catholics and devout Calvinists joining against secular liberals. The Catholics, who had been loosely allied with the liberals in earlier decades, turned against them on the issue of state support, which the liberals insisted should be granted only to public schools, and joined with Protestant political parties in demanding equal state support to schools maintained by religious groups.<ref>J. C. H. Blom and E. Lamberts, eds. ''History of the Low Countries'' (1999) pp. 387\u2013403</ref>\n\nThe Netherlands remained one of the most tolerant countries in Europe towards religious belief, although conservative Protestants objected to the liberalization of the Dutch Reformed Church during the 19th century and faced opposition from the government when they tried to establish separate communities (Catholics and other non-Protestants were left unmolested by Dutch authorities). Some moved to the United States as a consequence, but as the century drew to a close, religious persecution had totally ceased.\n\n[[File:Old-Amsterdam 1891-street-1.jpg|thumb|Street in Amsterdam in 1891 ({{Interlanguage link multi|Vijzelstraat|nl}} looking towards Muntplein).]]\nDutch social and political life became divided by fairly clear-cut internal borders that were emerging as the society pillarized into three separate parts based on religion.  The economy was not affected. One of the people most responsible for designing pillarization was [[Abraham Kuyper]] (1837\u20131920), a leading politician, [[neo-Calvinist]] theologian, and journalist. Kuyper established orthodox Calvinist organizations, and also provided a theoretical framework by developing such concepts as \"sphere-sovereignty\" that celebrated Dutch society as a society of organized minorities. ''Verzuiling'' (\"pillarization\" or \"pluralism\") after 1850 became the solution to the danger of internal conflict. Everyone was part of one (and only one) pillar (''zuil'') based chiefly on religion (Protestant, Catholic, secular). The secular pillar eventually split into a socialist/working class pillar and a liberal (pro-business) secular pillar. Each pillar built a full set of its own social organizations, including churches (for the religious pillars), political parties, schools, universities,<ref>The oldest universities, in Leiden, Utrecht, and Groningen, had a secular-liberal character. In 1880 Kuyper opened a Protestant university in Amsterdam and in 1923 a Catholic one opened in Nijmegen. The Amsterdam municipal university, which opened in 1877, leaned toward secular-socialism, but was formally neutral.</ref> labor unions, sport clubs, boy scout unions and other youth clubs, and newspapers. The members of different ''zuilen'' lived in close proximity in cities and villages, spoke the same language, and did business with one another, but seldom interacted informally and rarely intermarried.<ref>A Dutch rhyme forbade intermarriage thus: ''Twee geloven op \u00e9\u00e9n kussen, daar slaapt de Duivel tussen'' [Two religions on one pillow, there the Devil sleeps in between.] On the decline of intermarriage see Erik Beekink, et al. \"Changes in Choice of Spouse as an Indicator of a Society in a State of Transition: Woerden, 1830\u20131930.\" ''Historical Social Research'' 1998 23(1\u20132): 231\u201353. {{ISSN|0172-6404}}</ref> In politics Kuyper formed the [[Anti-Revolutionary Party]] (ARP) in 1879, and headed it until 1905.\n\nPillarization was officially recognized in the [[Pacification of 1917]], whereby socialists and liberals achieved their goal of universal male suffrage and the religious parties were guaranteed equal funding of all schools.<ref>Kossmann, ''Low Countries'' pp-57</ref> In 1930 radio was organized so that each pillar had full control of its own network. When television began in the late 1940s the pillars divided up time equally on the one station.

The [[Hague School]] brought a revival of realist painting, 1860\u20131890. The world-famous Dutch painter was [[Vincent van Gogh]], but he spent most of his career in France.<ref>Richard Bionda and [[Carel Blotkamp]], eds. ''The Age of Van Gogh: Dutch Painting 1880\u20131895'' (1997)</ref>  Literature, music, architecture and science also flourished. A representative leader of science was [[Johannes Diderik van der Waals]] (1837\u20131923), a working class youth who taught himself physics, earned a PhD at the nation's leading school Leiden University, and in 1910 won the Nobel Prize for his discoveries in thermodynamics. [[Hendrik Lorentz]] (1853\u20131928) and his student [[Pieter Zeeman]] (1865\u20131943) shared the 1902 Nobel Prize in physics.  Other notable scientists included biologist [[Hugo de Vries]] (1848\u20131935), who rediscovered Mendelian genetics.<ref>Leo Beek, ''Dutch Pioneers of Science'' (1986)</ref>\n\n==1900 to 1940==\n[[File:Queen Wilhelmina2.jpg|left|thumb|[[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]], queen of the Netherlands from 1890 to 1948.]]\n\nIn 1890, [[William III of the Netherlands|William III]] died after a long reign and was succeeded by his young daughter, [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]] (1880\u20131962). She would rule the Netherlands for 58 years. On her accession to the throne, the [[personal union]] between the Netherlands and Luxembourg ended because Luxembourg law excluded women from rule. Her remote cousin [[Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Adolphe]] became the Grand Duke of Luxembourg.\n\nThis was a time of further growth and colonial development, but it was marked by the difficulties of the [[World War I]] (in which the Netherlands was neutral) \nand the [[Great Depression]]. The Dutch population grew rapidly in the 20th century, as death rates fell, more lands were opened up, and industrialisation created urban jobs.<ref>Michael Wintle, ''An Economic and Social History of the Netherlands, 1800\u20131920: Demographic, Economic, and Social Transition'' (2000) p. 342</ref> Between 1900 and 1950 the population doubled from 5.1 to 10 million people.<ref name=\"CBS Statline - Population; history\">[http://statline.cbs.nl/StatWeb/publication/?DM=SLEN&PA=37556ENG&D1=0-44,53-60&D2=1,11,21,31,41,51,61,71,81,91,101&LA=EN&VW=T CBS Statline \u2013 Population; history].

It was smaller in 1945 than in 1815 because the Netherlands was the only colonial power that did not expand into Africa or anywhere else.  The empire was run from Batavia (in Java), where the governor and his technical experts had almost complete authority with little oversight from the Hague. Successive governors improved their bureaucratic and military controls, and allowed very little voice to the locals until the 1920s.<ref>Jean Gelman Taylor, ''The Social World of Batavia: Europeans and Eurasians in Colonial Indonesia'' (1983)</ref>\n\nThe colony brought economic opportunity to the mother country and there was little concern at the time about it. One exception came in 1860 when Eduard Dekker, under the pen name \"[[Multatuli]]\" wrote the novel ''[[Max Havelaar: Or the Coffee Auctions of the Dutch Trading Company]]'', one of the most notable books in the history of [[Dutch literature]]. He criticized the exploitation of the colony and as well had harsh words about the indigenous princes who collaborated with the governor. The book helped inspire the Indonesian independence movement in the mid-20th century as well as the \"[[Fair trade]]\" movement for coffee at the end of the century.<ref>{{cite book|author=Antony Wild|title=Coffee: A Dark History|url=https://archive.org/details/coffeedarkhistor0000wild|url-access=registration|year=2005|publisher=W.

As the map shows, the Dutch slowly expanded their holdings from their base in Java to include all of modern Indonesia by 1920. Most islands were not a problem but there was a long, costly campaign against the [[Aceh Sultanate|Achin (Aceh)]] state in northern Sumatra.\n\nThe Netherlands had not fought a major military campaign since the 1760s, and the strength of its armed forces had gradually dwindled. The Dutch decided not to ally themselves with anyone, and kept out of all European wars especially the First World War that swirled about it.<ref name = \"hvhqei\">Maartje M.

It supplied many essential raw materials to Germany such as rubber, tin, quinine, oil and food. The British used its blockade to limit supplies that the Dutch could pass on.<ref name = \"hvhqei\"/> There were other factors that made it expedient for both the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] and the [[Central Powers]] for the Netherlands to remain neutral. The Netherlands controlled the mouths of the [[Scheldt]], the [[Rhine]] and the [[Meuse River]]s. Germany had an interest in the Rhine since it ran through the industrial areas of the [[Ruhr]] and connected it with the Dutch port of Rotterdam. Britain had an interest in the Scheldt River and the Meuse flowed from France. All countries had an interest in keeping the others out of the Netherlands so that no one's interests could be taken away or be changed. If one country were to have invaded the Netherlands, another would certainly have counterattacked to defend their own interest in the rivers. It was too big a risk for any of the belligerent nations and none wanted to risk fighting on another front.<ref name = \"hvhqei\"/>\n\n[[File:Afsluitdijk 01.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Afsluitdijk]], the dike closing off the [[Zuiderzee]], was constructed between 1927 and 1933. Public works projects like this were one way to deal with high unemployment during the [[Great Depression]].]]\nThe Dutch were affected by the war, troops were mobilized and conscription was introduced in the face of harsh criticism from opposition parties. In 1918, mutinies broke out in the military. Food shortages were extensive, due to the control the belligerents exercised over the Dutch. Each wanted their share of Dutch produce. As a result, the price of potatoes rose sharply because Britain had demanded so much from the Dutch. Food riots even broke out in the country.<ref name = \"hvhqei\"/> A big problem was smuggling. When Germany had conquered Belgium, the Allies saw it as enemy territory and stopped exporting to Belgium. Food became scarce for the Belgian people, since the Germans seized all food. This gave the Dutch the opportunity to start to smuggle. This, however, caused great problems in the Netherlands, including inflation and further food shortages. The Allies demanded that the Dutch stop the smuggling, and the government took measures to remain neutral. The government placed many cities under 'state of siege'. On 8 January 1916, a {{convert|5|km|mi|adj=on}} zone was created by the government along the border. In that zone, goods could be moved on main roads with a permit.<ref name = \"hvhqei\"/> German authorities in Belgium had an electrified fence erected all along the Belgian\u2013Dutch border that caused many refugees from Belgium to lose their lives.  The fence was guarded by older German Landsturm soldiers.<ref>{{cite web|title=De Dodendraad \u2013 Wereldoorlog I|url=http://www.bunkergordel.be/14.023%20De%20Dodendraad.htm|publisher=Bunkergordel.be|accessdate=19 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Interwar period ===\n{{Main|Great Depression in the Netherlands}}\nAlthough both houses of the Dutch Parliament were elected by the people, only men with high incomes were eligible to vote until 1917, when pressure from socialist movements resulted in elections in which all men regardless of income, were entitled to vote. In 1919, women also obtained the right to vote for the first time in history.\n\nThe worldwide [[Great Depression]] which began after the tumultuous events of [[Black Tuesday]] in 1929, that continued into the early-1930s had crippling effects on the Dutch economy; lasting longer than in most other European countries. The long duration of the Great Depression in the Netherlands is often explained by the very strict fiscal policy of the Dutch government at the time, and its decision to adhere to the [[gold standard]] for much longer than most of its trading partners. The Great Depression led to high unemployment and widespread poverty, as well as increasing social unrest.\n\nThe rise of [[Nazism]] in Germany did not go unnoticed in the Netherlands, and there was growing concern at the possibility of armed conflict, but most Dutch people expected that Germany would again respect Dutch neutrality.\n\nThere were separate fascist and Nazi movements in the 1930s. Dutch Fascists admired Mussolini's Italy and called for a traditional corporate ideology. The membership was small, elitist and ineffective. The pro-Nazi movement, however, won support from [[Berlin]] and attempted to build a mass base by 1935. It failed because most Dutch rejected its racial ideology and calls for violence.<ref>Erik Hansen, \"Fascism and Nazism in the Netherlands 1929\u201339,\" ''European Studies Review'' (1981) 11#3 pp. 355\u201385.

The budget was further increased in 1938 (after the [[Anschluss|annexation of Austria]] and occupation of the Czech [[Sudetenland]]). The colonial government also increased its military budget because of increasing tensions with Japan. The Dutch did not mobilise their armed forces until shortly before France and the UK declared war on Germany in September 1939 after the invasion of Poland. Neutrality was still the official policy, but the Dutch government tried to buy new arms for their badly equipped forces; however, a considerable share of ordered weapons never arrived.\n\n==The Second World War (1939\u20131945)==\n{{Main|History of the Netherlands (1939\u20131945)}}\n\n===Nazi invasion and occupation===\n{{Main|Battle of the Netherlands|Rotterdam Blitz|Dutch resistance}}\n[[File:Rotterdam, Laurenskerk, na bombardement van mei 1940.jpg|thumb|Rotterdam was destroyed by German bombers on 14 May 1940. 814 people died in the [[Rotterdam Blitz]].]]\n\nAt the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the Netherlands once again declared its [[neutral country|neutrality]]. However, on 10 May 1940, [[Nazi Germany]] launched an attack on the Netherlands and Belgium and quickly overran most of the two countries. Fighting against the Dutch army proved to be more of a burden than foreseen; the northern attack was stopped dead, the one in the middle came to a grinding halt near the Grebbeberg and many airborne assault troops were killed and taken prisoner in the west of the country.\nOnly in the south were defences broken, but the one passage over the River Maas at Rotterdam was held by the Dutch. By 14 May, fighting in many locations had ceased and the German army could make little or no headway, so the [[Luftwaffe]] bombed [[Rotterdam]], the second-largest city of the Netherlands, killing about 900 people, destroying most of the inner city and leaving 78,000 people homeless.\n\nFollowing the bombing and German threats of the same treatment for [[Utrecht]], the Netherlands capitulated on 15 May, except for the province of [[Zeeland]] where French and French-Moroccan troops stood side-by-side with the Dutch army. Still, the Dutch Royal Family along with some armed forces fled to the United Kingdom. Some members of the Dutch Royal Family eventually moved to [[Ottawa]], Ontario, Canada until the Netherlands was liberated five years later.  [[Princess Margriet of the Netherlands|Princess Margriet]] was born in Canada, during the period the family spent in exile.\n\nResentment of the Germans grew as the occupation became more harsh, prompting many Dutch in the latter years of the war to join the [[Dutch resistance|resistance]]. But collaboration was not uncommon either; many thousands of young Dutch males volunteered for combat service on the Russian Front with the [[Waffen-SS]] and many companies worked for the German occupiers.\n\n===Holocaust in the Netherlands===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Exhibit of the Anne Frank Zentrum.jpg\n| width1 = 200\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = Yellow [[Star of David]] with ''Jood'', the Dutch word for \"[[Jew]]\".\n| image2 = WWII netherlands persoonsbewijs.jpg\n| width2 = 165\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = [[Identification papers]] issued to Dutch people during the war.\n| footer = \n}}\nAbout 140,000 Jews lived in the Netherlands at the beginning of the war.

The [[First Canadian Army]] and the Second British Army conducted operations on Dutch soil from September onwards. On 17 September, a daring operation, [[Operation Market Garden]]; was executed with the goal of capturing bridges across three major rivers in the southern Netherlands. Despite desperate fighting by American, British and Polish forces, the bridge at [[Arnhem]], across the Neder Rijn, could not be captured.\n\nAreas south of the Rhine river were liberated in the period September\u2013December 1944, including the province of Zeeland, which was liberated in October and November in the [[Battle of the Scheldt]]. This opened [[Antwerp]] to allied shipping. The [[First Canadian Army]] held a static line along the [[river Meuse]] (Maas) from December 1944 through February 1945.\n\nThe rest of the country remained occupied until the spring of 1945. In the face of Dutch defiance, the Nazis deliberately cut off food supplies resulting in near-starvation in the cities during the ''[[Hongerwinter]]'' ([[Hunger winter]]) of 1944\u201345. Soup kitchens were set up but many vulnerable people died.<ref>William I.

In the final weeks of the war in Europe, the First Canadian Army was charged with clearing the [[Netherlands]] of German forces.\n\nThe [[Liberation of Arnhem]] began on 12 April 1945 and proceeded to plan, as the three infantry brigades of the 49th Division leapfrogged each other through the city.

On 27 April a temporary truce came into effect, allowing the distribution of food aid to the starving Dutch civilians in areas under German control ([[Operations Manna and Chowhound|Operation Manna]]). On 5 May 1945, Generaloberst [[Johannes Blaskowitz|Blaskowitz]] agreed to the unconditional surrender of all German forces in the Netherlands, signing the surrender to Canadian general [[Charles Foulkes (Canadian general)|Charles Foulkes]] at [[Wageningen]].<ref>Stacey, Colonel Charles Perry, ''Official History of the Canadian Army in the Second World War'', Volume III, ''[http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/his/docs/Victory_e.pdf The Victory Campaign: The Operations in North-West Europe 1944\u20131945]'' (The Queen's Printer and Controller of Stationery Ottawa, 1960) (Downloaded: 4 July 2009), pp. 576\u2013614</ref> (The Fifth of May is now celebrated annually in the Netherlands as [[Liberation Day]].)

[[Artur Seyss-Inquart]], Nazi Commissioner of the Netherlands, was tried at N\u00fcremberg.\n\nIn the early post-war years, the Netherlands made continued attempts to expand its territory by annexing neighbouring German territory. The [[Bakker-Schut Plan|larger annexation plans]] were continuously rejected by the United States, but the London conference of 1949 permitted the Netherlands to perform a smaller scale [[annexation]]. Most of the annexed territory was returned to Germany on 1 August 1963.<ref>[http://geschiedenis.vpro.nl/programmas/2899536/afleveringen/3606801/ 'Eisch Duitschen grond!'] 3 May 2001 in Dutch.

This was followed by large-scale public works programmes, economic recovery, European integration and the gradual introduction of a welfare state.\n\nImmediately after the war, rationing was imposed on many goods, including: cigarettes, textiles, washing powder and coffee.

He led four successive cabinets [[Netherlands cabinet Drees-1|Drees I]], [[Netherlands cabinet Drees-2|Drees II]], [[Netherlands cabinet Drees-3|Drees III]] and [[Netherlands cabinet Drees-4|Drees IV]] until 1958. His tenure in office saw four major political developments: the traumas of decolonisation, [[economic reconstruction]], the establishment of the Dutch [[welfare state]], and international integration and co-operation, including the formation of [[Benelux]], the [[OEEC]], [[NATO]], the [[European Coal and Steel Community|ECSC]], and the [[EEC]].\n\n===Baby boom and economic reconstruction===\n[[File:Population of the Netherlands 1900-2000.png|thumb|left|Population growth 1900\u20132000]]\n\nDespite the socio-economic problems, this was a period of optimism for many. A baby boom followed the war, as young Dutch couples started the families they couldn't previously due to the war. They had lived through the hardships of the Great Depression and the hell of war. They wanted to start afresh and live better lives without the poverty, starvation, terror, and extreme frugality they knew so well. They had little taste for a strictly imposed rule-oriented traditional system with its rigid hierarchies, sharp pillarised boundaries and strictly orthodox religious doctrines. The translation of ''The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care'' (1946), by American pediatrician [[Benjamin Spock]] was a best-seller. His vision of family life as companionate, permissive, enjoyable and even as being fun took hold, and seemed the best way to achieve family happiness in a dawning age of freedom and prosperity.<ref name=\"Janneke Wubs 2002 pp 209\">Nelleke Bakker and Janneke Wubs, \"A Mysterious Success: Doctor Spock and the Netherlands in the 1950s\", ''Paedagogica Historica'' (2002) 38#1 pp. 209\u201326.</ref>\n\nWages were kept low and the recovery of consumption to pre-war levels was delayed to permit rapid rebuilding of the infrastructure. In the years after the war, unemployment fell and the economy grew at an astonishing pace, despite the high birth rate. The shattered infrastructure and destroyed cities were rebuilt. A key contribution to the recovery in the post-war Netherlands came from the [[Marshall Plan]], which provided the country with funds, goods, raw materials and produce.<ref>Van der Eng, Pierre (1987). ''De Marshall-Hulp, Een Perspectief voor Nederland 1947\u20131953.'' Houten: De Haan.</ref>\n\nThe Dutch became internationally active again. Dutch corporations, particularly [[Royal Dutch Shell]] and [[Philips]], became internationally prominent. Businesspeople, scientists, engineers and artists from the Netherlands made important international contributions. For example, Dutch economists, especially [[Jan Tinbergen]] (1903\u20131994), [[Tjalling Koopmans]] (1910\u20131985) and [[Henri Theil]] (1924\u20132000), made major contributions to the mathematical and statistical methodology known as [[econometrics]].<ref>Andrew J.

The Netherlands also experienced years of negative growth after that. Unemployment increased steadily, causing rapid growth in social-security expenditures. Inflation reached double digits; government surpluses disappeared. On the positive side, rich natural gas resources were developed, providing a current account trade surplus during most of the period. Public deficits were high.<ref>Green-Pedersen, ''The Politics of Justification: Party Competition and Welfare-State Retrenchment in Denmark and the Netherlands from 1982\u20131998'' p. 44</ref> According to the long-term economic analysis of Horlings and Smits, the major gains in the Dutch economy were concentrated between 1870\u20131930 and between 1950\u201370.

More than 1,800 people drowned in the ensuing inundation.\n\nThe Dutch government subsequently decided on a large-scale programme of public works (the \"[[Deltawerken|Delta Works]]\") to protect the country against future floods. The project took more than thirty years to complete. The Oosterscheldedam, an advanced sea storm barrier, became operational in 1986. According to Dutch government engineers, the odds of a major inundation anywhere in the Netherlands are now one in 10,000 years.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Europeanisation, Americanisation and internationalisation===\nThe [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC), was founded in 1951 by the six founding members: Belgium, the Netherlands and [[Luxembourg]] (the [[Benelux]] countries) and West Germany, France and Italy. Its purpose was to pool the steel and coal resources of the member states, and to support the economies of the participating countries. As a side effect, the ECSC helped defuse tensions between countries which had recently been fighting each other during the war. In time, this economic merger grew, adding members and broadening in scope, to become the [[European Economic Community]], and later the [[European Union]] (EU).\n[[File:Anti kernwapendemonstratie in Den Haag ( 550 duizend deelnemers ) overzichten m, Bestanddeelnr 253-8817.jpg|thumb|Protest in The Hague against the [[nuclear arms race]] between the U.S./NATO and the Warsaw Pact, 1983]]\nThe United States started to have more influence.

However, the Netherlands was much too weak to reconquer Indonesia. The Japanese had imprisoned all the Dutch residents, and turned the islands over to a native government, which was widely popular. The British military arrived to disarm the Japanese.

The UK mediated a compromise signed in March 1947 whereby de facto control of the new [[Indonesian Republic]] was acknowledged over Java, Maduro and Sumatra, while acknowledging Dutch control over the numerous smaller and far less important islands. Supposedly there would be a federated Indonesian state and a union with the Netherlands, but that never happened. The Indonesians wanted complete transfer of power, and the Dutch refused. By 1946, the United States was financing the Dutch in Indonesia, and was able to exert pressure on The Hague.  Increasing international pressure\u2014including American hints about cutting off military funds\u2014forced the Netherlands to withdraw. A decisive episode was the success of the Indonesian Republic in crushing a Communist revolt.

Abortion and [[euthanasia]] were decriminalised, but stricter guidelines were set for their implementation. Drug policy, especially with regard to the regulation of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], was reformed. Prostitution was legalised, but confined to brothels where the health and safety of those involved could be properly monitored. With the 2001 [[Same-sex marriage in the Netherlands|Same-Sex Marriage Act]], the Netherlands became the first country in the world to legalise [[same-sex marriage]]. In addition to social reforms, the Purple Coalition also presided over a period of remarkable economic prosperity.\n\n===Recent politics===\n[[File:Wim_Kok_1994.jpg|thumb|[[Wim Kok]] served as Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 22 August 1994 until 22 July 2002.]]\n\nAt the 1998 general election, the [[First cabinet of Wim Kok|Purple Coalition]] consisting of Social Democrats, and left and right-wing Liberals, increased its majority. Both the social democratic PvdA and the conservative liberal VVD grew at the cost of their junior partner in cabinet, the progressive liberal D66. The voters rewarded the Purple Coalition for its economic performance, which had included reduction of unemployment and the budget deficit, steady growth and job creation combined with wage freezes and trimming of the welfare state, together with a policy of fiscal restraint.<ref>[http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/arc/2231_98.htm Netherlands: Elections held in 1998] Inter-Parliamentary Union</ref> The result was the [[Second cabinet of Wim Kok|second Kok cabinet]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Aarts | first1 = Kees | last2 = Semetko | first2 = Holli A. | author-link1 = Kees Aarts (political scientist) | author-link2 = Holli Semetko | title = Representation and responsibility: the 1998 Dutch election in perspective | journal = [[Acta Politica]] | volume = 34 | issue = 2 | pages = 111\u201329 |year = 1999 | url = http://www.palgrave-journals.com/ap | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\nThe power of the coalition waned with the introduction of [[Pim Fortuyn List|List Pim Fortuyn]] in the [[Dutch general election, 2002|Dutch general election of 2002]], a populist party, which ran a distinctly anti-immigration and anti-purple campaign, citing [[De puinhopen van acht jaar Paars|\"Purple Chaos\"]] (''Puinhopen van Paars'') as the source of the countries social woes. In the first political assassination for three centuries, Fortuyn was [[Assassination of Pim Fortuyn|murdered]] with little over a week left before the election. In the wake of its leader's death, LPF swept the elections, entering parliament with one-sixth of the seats, while the PvdA (Labour) lost half of its seats. The ensuing [[First Balkenende cabinet|cabinet]] was formed by CDA, VVD and LPF, led by Prime Minister [[Jan Peter Balkenende]]. Though the party succeeded in displacing the rival Purple Coalition, without the charismatic figure of Pim Fortuyn at its helm, it proved to be short-lived; lasting a mere 87 days in government.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Irwin | first1 = Galen A. | last2 = van Holsteyn | first2 = Joop J.

His party won a landslide election victory, partly because of his perceived martyrdom, However, internal party squabbles and blowing up the coalition government they had helped to create, resulted in the loss of 70% of their support at early general elections in 2003.\n* Another murder that caused great upheaval took place on 2 November 2004, when film director and publicist [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]] was assassinated by a Dutch-Moroccan youth with [[Islamic extremism|Islamic extremist]] views, because of Van Gogh's alleged blasphemy. One week later, several arrests were made of several would-be Islamic terrorists, who have later been found guilty of conspiracy with terrorist intentions, this verdict was however reversed on appeal. All this sparked a debate on the position of Islamic extremism and of Islam generally in Dutch society, and on immigration and integration. The personal protection of most politicians, especially of the Islam critic [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]], was stepped up to unprecedented levels.\n\n===The Netherlands today===\n[[File:Balkenende visits Bush June 2008.jpg|thumb|Dutch Prime Minister [[Jan Peter Balkenende]] and U.S. President [[George W.

In 3500 pages he crafted a literary masterpiece that was translated into numerous languages; his dramatic story reached a wide audience in the 19th century. Motley relied heavily on Dutch scholarship and immersed himself in the sources. His style no longer attracts readers, and scholars have moved away from his simplistic dichotomies of good versus evil, Dutch versus Spanish, Catholic versus Protestant, freedom versus authoritarianism. His theory of causation over-emphasized ethnicity as an unchanging characteristic, exaggerated the importance of William of Orange, and gave undue importance to the issue religious tolerance.<ref>Robert Wheaton, \"Motley and the Dutch Historians,\" ''New England Quarterly'' (1962) 35#3 pp. 318\u201336 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/363823 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nThe pioneering Dutch cultural historian [[Johan Huizinga]] (1872\u20131945), author of ''The Autumn of the Middle Ages'' (1919) (the English translation was called ''The Waning of the Middle Ages'') and ''Homo Ludens: A Study of the Play Element in Culture'' (1935), which expanded the field of cultural history and influenced the historical anthropology of younger historians of the French [[Annales School]].

Cruz (2007) explains the major debates among scholars regarding the Dutch bid for independence from Spanish rule. While agreeing that the intellectual milieus of late 19th and 20th centuries affected historians' interpretations, Cruz argues that writings about the revolt trace changing perceptions of the role played by small countries in the history of Europe.  In recent decades grand theory has fallen out of favor among most scholars, who emphasize the particular over the general. Dutch and Belgian historiography since 1945 no longer says the revolt was the culmination of an inevitable process leading to independence and freedom. Instead scholars have put the political and economic details of the towns and provinces under the microscope, while agreeing on the weaknesses of attempts at centralization by the Habsburg rulers. The most influential new studies have been rooted in demographic and economic history, though scholars continue to debate the relationship between economics and politics. The religious dimension has been viewed in terms of mentalities, exposing the minority position of Calvinism, while the international aspects have been studied more seriously by foreign historians than by the Dutch themselves.<ref>Laura Cruz, \"The 80 Years' Question: the Dutch Revolt in Historical Perspective.\"  ''History Compass'' 2007 5(3): 914\u201334.</ref>\n\n[[Pieter Geyl]] was the leading historian of the Dutch Revolt, and a highly influential professor at the University of London (1919\u20131935) and at the State University of Utrecht (1936\u201358). He wrote a six-volume history of the Dutch-speaking peoples.<ref>Three volumes appeared in English translation, ''The Revolit of the Netherlands (1555\u20131609)'' (1932); and ''The Netherlands in the Seventeenth Century'' (2 vol 1936, 1964).</ref> The Nazis imprisoned him in World War II. In his political views, Geyl adopted the views of the 17th-century Dutch Louvestein faction, led by Johan van Oldenbarneveldt (1547\u20131619) and Johan de Witt (1625\u201372). It stood for liberty, toleration, and national interests in contrast to the Orange stadholders who sought to promote their own self-interest. According to Geyl, the Dutch Republic reached the peak of its powers during the 17th century. He was also a staunch nationalist and suggested that Flanders could split off from Belgium and join the Netherlands. Later he decried what he called radical nationalism and stressed more the vitality of Western Civilization. Geyl was highly critical of the [[world history]] approach of [[Arnold J. Toynbee]].<ref>Herbert H. Rowen, \"The Historical Work of Pieter Geyl.\" ''Journal of Modern History'' 1965 37(1): 35\u201349. {{ISSN|0022-2801}} [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1874563 in Jstor]</ref>\n\n[[Jan Romein]] (1893\u20131962) created a \"theoretical history\" in an attempt to reestablish the relevance of history to public life in the 1930s at a time of immense political uncertainty and cultural crisis, when Romein thought that history had become too inward-looking and isolated from other disciplines. Romein, a Marxist, wanted history to contribute to social improvement. At the same time, influenced by the successes of theoretical physics and his study of [[Oswald Spengler]], [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], [[Frederick John Teggart]], and others, he spurred on the development of theoretical history in the Netherlands, to the point where it became a subject in its own right at the university level after the war. Romein used the term integral history as a substitute for cultural history and focused his attention on the period around the turn of the century. He concluded that a serious crisis occurred in European civilization in 1900 because of the rise of anti-Semitism, extreme nationalism, discontent with the parliamentary system, depersonalization of the state, and the rejection of positivism. European civilization waned as the result of this crisis which was accompanied by the rise of the United States, the Americanization of the world, and the emergence of Asia. His interpretation is reminiscent of that of his mentor Johan Huizinga and was criticized by his colleague Pieter Geyl.<ref>A. C.

end}}\n'''{{Audio|Jin1hua2.ogg|Jinhua}}''', alternately romanized as '''Kinhwa''', is a [[prefecture-level city]] in central [[Zhejiang]] province in [[eastern China]]. It borders the provincial capital of [[Hangzhou]] to the northwest, [[Quzhou]] to the southwest, [[Lishui]] to the south, [[Taizhou, Zhejiang|Taizhou]] to the east, and [[Shaoxing]] to the northeast. Its population was 5,361,572 at the 2010 census including 1,077,245 in the built-up area made of two urban districts (not including the satellite city of [[Lanxi, Zhejiang|Lanxi]], which has become essentially a suburban offshoot of Jinhua's main urban area).\n\nJinhua is rich in [[Ultisols|red soil]] and forest resources. The Jinhua or Wu River flows through the Lan and Fuchun to the [[Qiantang River]] beside [[Hangzhou]], which flows into [[Hangzhou Bay]] and the [[East China Sea]]. In medieval China, it formed part of the water network feeding supplies to the southern end of the [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]]. It is best known for its dry-cured [[Jinhua ham]].\n\n==History and culture==\nThe history of Jinhua dates back to the 2nd century BC, when it was a county subordinate to [[Shaoxing]]. It was given the name Jinhua under the [[Sui dynasty]] in AD 598 and later became the seat of a [[prefecture]]. The present city and its walls date to the [[Yuan dynasty]] in 1352.\n\nThe most famous native of Jinhua is [[Huang Chuping]], a [[Daoism|Daoist]] holy man of the 4th century and reputed [[xian (Taoism)|immortal]] whose descendants still live in the area. [[Wuyang Shan]] (\"Reclining Sheep Mountain\") is said to be a sheep which was turned to stone by Huang, a trick which he learned through his years of diligently studying Daoism.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nEconomically Jinhua has always prospered from its position as the regional collecting and processing center for agricultural and forestry products (chiefly rice and bamboo). It is currently the second most important grain producing area in [[Zhejiang]]. In 1985 Jinhua was promoted to City status, and now is responsible for administering four cities, four counties and a district. Animals raised there include dairy cattle, meat hogs (for the production of [[Jinhua ham]], a famous local product for 900 years) and honeybees. Jinhua's industrial sector has developed more recently, producing machinery, metallurgy, pharmaceuticals, building supplies and electrical and electronic equipment.\n\nThe [[Tang dynasty]] painter [[Guan Xiu]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.whittier.edu/academic/english/Chinese/Guanxiu.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526160219/http://web.whittier.edu/academic/english/Chinese/Guanxiu.htm |archivedate=2011-05-26 }}</ref> (Kuan-hsiu) was born in Jinhua. He is known for his paintings of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] holy men.\n\nThere are numerous scenic and historical sites in the Jinhua region, including many places associated with the Immortal Huang, and a palace of the Dukes of the\n[[Taiping Rebellion|Taiping Heavenly Kingdom]].\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:China Map.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Jinhua in the [[Yangtze River Delta]]]]\nJinhua is located at latitudes 28\u00b0 32'\u221229\u00b0 41' N and longitudes 119\u00b0 14'\u2212120\u00b0 46' E in the center of [[Zhejiang]].

end}}\n'''{{Audio|Jin1hua2.ogg|Jinhua}}''', alternately romanized as '''Kinhwa''', is a [[prefecture-level city]] in central [[Zhejiang]] province in [[eastern China]]. It borders the provincial capital of [[Hangzhou]] to the northwest, [[Quzhou]] to the southwest, [[Lishui]] to the south, [[Taizhou, Zhejiang|Taizhou]] to the east, and [[Shaoxing]] to the northeast. Its population was 5,361,572 at the 2010 census including 1,077,245 in the built-up area made of two urban districts (not including the satellite city of [[Lanxi, Zhejiang|Lanxi]], which has become essentially a suburban offshoot of Jinhua's main urban area).\n\nJinhua is rich in [[Ultisols|red soil]] and forest resources. The Jinhua or Wu River flows through the Lan and Fuchun to the [[Qiantang River]] beside [[Hangzhou]], which flows into [[Hangzhou Bay]] and the [[East China Sea]]. In medieval China, it formed part of the water network feeding supplies to the southern end of the [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]]. It is best known for its dry-cured [[Jinhua ham]].\n\n==History and culture==\nThe history of Jinhua dates back to the 2nd century BC, when it was a county subordinate to [[Shaoxing]]. It was given the name Jinhua under the [[Sui dynasty]] in AD 598 and later became the seat of a [[prefecture]]. The present city and its walls date to the [[Yuan dynasty]] in 1352.\n\nThe most famous native of Jinhua is [[Huang Chuping]], a [[Daoism|Daoist]] holy man of the 4th century and reputed [[xian (Taoism)|immortal]] whose descendants still live in the area. [[Wuyang Shan]] (\"Reclining Sheep Mountain\") is said to be a sheep which was turned to stone by Huang, a trick which he learned through his years of diligently studying Daoism.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nEconomically Jinhua has always prospered from its position as the regional collecting and processing center for agricultural and forestry products (chiefly rice and bamboo). It is currently the second most important grain producing area in [[Zhejiang]]. In 1985 Jinhua was promoted to City status, and now is responsible for administering four cities, four counties and a district. Animals raised there include dairy cattle, meat hogs (for the production of [[Jinhua ham]], a famous local product for 900 years) and honeybees. Jinhua's industrial sector has developed more recently, producing machinery, metallurgy, pharmaceuticals, building supplies and electrical and electronic equipment.\n\nThe [[Tang dynasty]] painter [[Guan Xiu]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.whittier.edu/academic/english/Chinese/Guanxiu.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526160219/http://web.whittier.edu/academic/english/Chinese/Guanxiu.htm |archivedate=2011-05-26 }}</ref> (Kuan-hsiu) was born in Jinhua. He is known for his paintings of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] holy men.\n\nThere are numerous scenic and historical sites in the Jinhua region, including many places associated with the Immortal Huang, and a palace of the Dukes of the\n[[Taiping Rebellion|Taiping Heavenly Kingdom]].\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:China Map.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Jinhua in the [[Yangtze River Delta]]]]\nJinhua is located at latitudes 28\u00b0 32'\u221229\u00b0 41' N and longitudes 119\u00b0 14'\u2212120\u00b0 46' E in the center of [[Zhejiang]].

In the [[Republic of the Congo Civil War (1997-99)|1997-99 Civil War]], they allied with Lissouba's forces against the supporters of former President [[Denis Sassou Nguesso]].

The conflict in the Pool escalated in a series of violent clashes in 2002-03, after which the Ninja leadership eventually gave up their armed struggle.

It received generally unfavorable reviews from critics, who called it \"confusing and a chaotic mess,\" alongside criticizing the cinematography and editing in the action sequences, although the performance of Uwais received praise.<!--cited in Reception-->\n\n==Plot==\n[[CIA officer]] and former [[U.S. Marine]] [[Force Recon]] [[veteran]], James Silva, leads a [[Special Activities Center|Special Activities Division]] team code-named Overwatch to raid a Russian [[Federal Security Service|FSB]] safe house in the United States. Under the remote supervision of James Bishop and his team, the mission is to locate and destroy shipments of [[caesium]] before the highly radioactive substance can be weaponized. In the ensuing firefight, most of the Russians and Overwatch operative Greg Vickers are killed, and critical intelligence on the caesium is destroyed. Silva executes the last survivor, a teenager who warns him that he is making a mistake.\n\nSixteen months later, in the [[Southeast Asian]] country of [[List of fictional countries|Indocarr]], police officer Li Noor surrenders himself at the US Embassy to negotiate for passage out of the country in exchange for information. Noor is revealed to be the asset of Overwatch agent Alice Kerr and reveals he possesses a disc containing information on the caesium, and is able to negotiate passage out of the country in exchange for unlocking the disc, which is programmed to self destruct within eight hours. Ambassador Dorothy Brady is visited by the country's Deputy Foreign Minister and state intelligence agent Axel, with the two demanding that Noor be handed over as he is wanted for [[espionage]]. Meanwhile, Noor fends off an assassination attempt by disguised government agents in the embassy infirmary using his skills as a former member of the elite tactical squad. \n\nWanting access to the intel, Silva's team is instructed to take Noor to an airplane at an airstrip 22 miles away, being provided with remote assistance from Bishop's team in [[Colombia]]. En route they are attacked by a group of men on motorcycles, who use a brief camera blackout to plant a bomb on one of the vehicles. During the ensuing gunfight, operative Sam Snow is mortally injured, and sacrifices herself to buy the group time. Taking cover in a restaurant, they are again attacked by Axel's men, in which Silva is saved by Noor and operative William \u201cDougie\u201d Douglas is seriously injured. The group retreats into an apartment complex, and Douglas sacrifices himself by putting down cover fire. Inside the building, Alice becomes separated from Silva and Noor, but is able to escape harm by using grenades and is later saved by Noor. Axel attempts to stop their car from reaching the airstrip, but is killed by Bishop's team via a [[drone strike]]. Arriving just before the plane takes off, Noor and Alice board the aircraft, with Alice having been given time off to see her estranged daughter. Noor provides Overwatch with the passcode to access the disk, with the intel appearing to be legitimate locations of the caesium. \n\nNoticing that the password \"rozhdestvo111\" matches the address of the FSB safehouse at the start of the film which was Christmas 111, Bishop comes to the conclusion Noor has betrayed them, and is actually acting as a [[triple agent]] for the [[Russian government]]. The mission is compromised.  A team [[Beriev A-50]], led by Senior Lieutenant Aleksander Aslanov, breaches the CIA's secure communications and control room. The teenager killed by Silva at the safehouse is shown to be Anatole Kuragin, the son of high ranking government official Vera Kuragina, who ordered the operation and sought personal revenge against the group. She hired Noor to serve as Alice\u2019s informant so they would trust him and activate Overwatch.  The purpose of Noor's unique negotiation has been to reveal the ultimate depths of the CIA special teams.  On the plane, Noor disarms a guard and breaches the cockpit, as revealed by communications from the plane. Alice\u2019s fate is uncertain.

Under the remote supervision of James Bishop and his team, the mission is to locate and destroy shipments of [[caesium]] before the highly radioactive substance can be weaponized. In the ensuing firefight, most of the Russians and Overwatch operative Greg Vickers are killed, and critical intelligence on the caesium is destroyed. Silva executes the last survivor, a teenager who warns him that he is making a mistake.\n\nSixteen months later, in the [[Southeast Asian]] country of [[List of fictional countries|Indocarr]], police officer Li Noor surrenders himself at the US Embassy to negotiate for passage out of the country in exchange for information. Noor is revealed to be the asset of Overwatch agent Alice Kerr and reveals he possesses a disc containing information on the caesium, and is able to negotiate passage out of the country in exchange for unlocking the disc, which is programmed to self destruct within eight hours. Ambassador Dorothy Brady is visited by the country's Deputy Foreign Minister and state intelligence agent Axel, with the two demanding that Noor be handed over as he is wanted for [[espionage]]. Meanwhile, Noor fends off an assassination attempt by disguised government agents in the embassy infirmary using his skills as a former member of the elite tactical squad. \n\nWanting access to the intel, Silva's team is instructed to take Noor to an airplane at an airstrip 22 miles away, being provided with remote assistance from Bishop's team in [[Colombia]]. En route they are attacked by a group of men on motorcycles, who use a brief camera blackout to plant a bomb on one of the vehicles. During the ensuing gunfight, operative Sam Snow is mortally injured, and sacrifices herself to buy the group time. Taking cover in a restaurant, they are again attacked by Axel's men, in which Silva is saved by Noor and operative William \u201cDougie\u201d Douglas is seriously injured. The group retreats into an apartment complex, and Douglas sacrifices himself by putting down cover fire. Inside the building, Alice becomes separated from Silva and Noor, but is able to escape harm by using grenades and is later saved by Noor. Axel attempts to stop their car from reaching the airstrip, but is killed by Bishop's team via a [[drone strike]]. Arriving just before the plane takes off, Noor and Alice board the aircraft, with Alice having been given time off to see her estranged daughter. Noor provides Overwatch with the passcode to access the disk, with the intel appearing to be legitimate locations of the caesium. \n\nNoticing that the password \"rozhdestvo111\" matches the address of the FSB safehouse at the start of the film which was Christmas 111, Bishop comes to the conclusion Noor has betrayed them, and is actually acting as a [[triple agent]] for the [[Russian government]]. The mission is compromised.  A team [[Beriev A-50]], led by Senior Lieutenant Aleksander Aslanov, breaches the CIA's secure communications and control room. The teenager killed by Silva at the safehouse is shown to be Anatole Kuragin, the son of high ranking government official Vera Kuragina, who ordered the operation and sought personal revenge against the group. She hired Noor to serve as Alice\u2019s informant so they would trust him and activate Overwatch.  The purpose of Noor's unique negotiation has been to reveal the ultimate depths of the CIA special teams.  On the plane, Noor disarms a guard and breaches the cockpit, as revealed by communications from the plane. Alice\u2019s fate is uncertain.
