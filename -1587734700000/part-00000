It recounts the ''[[rishi]]'' Shandilya as performing a grand ''[[Yajna]]'' in the Sharda area, involving the local people and hundreds of worthy priests. During the ''Yajna'', a beautiful woman appeared, introducing herself as a [[Brahmin]]i who wished to participate. She said that she and her companion had come a long way and asked for food. Shandilya welcomed her and told her that the rules of the ''Yajna'' forbade him from giving her the food: the ''Yajna'' had to be completed, and the ''Purohits'' fed first. The Brahmini grew angry and declared herself to be [[V\u0101c]], the Vedic goddess and [[Adi Parashakti|Divine Mother]]. She revealed to him that the [[Paramatman]] he worshipped was the essence of the goddess. In her anger, she transformed before him into the divine ''Neela'' (or ''blue'') form of [[Saraswati]], with ornaments, weapons, and clouds, and declared that she would absorb the world. In shock, remorse and fear, Shandilya collapsed and died. Seeing his remorse, the goddess had him revived with ''[[Amrita]]'', the elixir of life, and transformed into a different, graceful form of Saraswati. Addressing him as \"son\", she told him that she was pleased with his devotion and compassion and would grant him whatever he wished. Shandilya, addressing her as the Divine Mother, asked her to revive the dead and restore the village and forest. Saraswati did so, instructing him to build his [[ashram]] at the base of the hill near the Madhumati river (present-day Neelum River). She took her abode there at Sharada Peeth.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Tikkoo|first=Brij Nath|url=https://archive.org/details/ShriSharadaMahatmyaBrijNathTikkoo|title=Shri Sharada Mahatmya|publisher=Vikas Printing Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=Ajmer|pages=(ii), 1, 7\u201313}}</ref>\n\nAn alternative account holds that Shandilya prayed to the goddess Sharada with great devotion, and was rewarded when she appeared to him and promised to show him her real, divine form. She advised him to look for the Sharada forest, and his journey was filled with miraculous experiences. On his way, he had a vision of the god [[Ganesha]] on the eastern side of a hill. When he reached the Neelum river, he bathed in it and saw half his body turn golden. Eventually, the goddess revealed herself to him in her triple form of Sharada, Saraswati and Vagdevi, and invited him to her abode. As he was preparing for a ritual, he drew water from the ''Mah\u0101sindhu''.

The two mountains overlooking the valley, Shardi and Nardi, are named after them. One day, Narada saw, from her abode on the mountain, that Sharada had died, and that giants were fleeing from her body. Furious, she summoned them and ordered them to build her a tomb, which became Sharada Peeth. The second legend says that there one was a giant who loved a princess. She desired a palace, and so he began work. At the time of morning [[Adhan|azan]], by which time he was supposed to have finished, the roof remained incomplete, and for that reason, Sharada Peeth today remains without a roof.<ref name=\"Qazi 111\u2013120\" />\n\n== Literary and cultural references ==\n[[File:View_From_Sharda_Fort,_Azad_Jammu_&_Kashmir,_Pakistan.jpg|alt=|thumb|320x320px|View of Neelum Valley from Sharada Peeth, where King Jayasimha's Royal Army would have camped]]Sharada Peeth has appeared in various historical and literary texts.

Three princes, Lothana, Vigraharaja and Bhoja, rebelled against [[Lohara dynasty#Jayasimha|King Jayasimha of Kashmir]]. These princes, pursued by the Royal Army, sought refuge in the upper Kishenganga Valley, in the Sirahsila Castle. Kalhana believed that the Royal Army took refuge in Sharada Peeth, because it had the open space required for a temporary military village, and because the area surrounding the Sirahsila Castle was not large enough to host a camp for a siege without the siege force being vulnerable to archers.<ref name=\"Qazi 111\u20131202\" />[[File:Raja_Ravi_Varma_-_Sankaracharya.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|299x299px|Adi Shankara, who opened Sharada Peeth's south door]]In the 14th century text ''Madhaviya Shankara Vijayam'', there is a test, unique to Sharada Peeth, known as the ''Sarvajna Peetham'', or Throne of Omniscience.

As he approached the southern door, he was stopped by various learned men from the [[Nyaya]] school of philosophy, Buddhists, [[Digambara|Digambara Jains]], and the followers of [[Jaimini]]. Engaging with them, he managed to persuade all of them of his proficiency in philosophy, and they stood aside to let him open the entrance. Finally, as he was about to ascend the throne, he heard the voice of the goddess Sharada challenging him. The voice said that omniscience was not enough if one was impure, and that Shankara, who lived in the palace of King Amaruka, could not be pure. Shankara replied that his body had never committed a sin, and the sins committed by another could not blemish him.

Historical records of the temple's architecture are scarce. A late 19th century account by [[Aurel Stein]] describes the temple's walls as intact to a height of approximately {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=}}, and its pillars rising approximately {{Convert|16|ft|m|abbr=}}. [[File:Sharada_temple.Stein1893.jpg|alt=|thumb|280x280px|A photograph of Sharada Peeth in 1893 by [[Aurel Stein|Sir Aurel Stein]]. A Kashmiri Pandit stands at the entrance]]\nThe compound is situated on a hill, and is approached on its west side, through an imposing stone staircase. The facades are repetitive, possibly because architects disliked plain outside walls, or else possibly so that even if the spire collapsed, a visitor would be able to tell what the temple originally looked like. The design is simple, with a plain conical Sharada spire. The temple sits on a raised [[plinth]], {{Convert|24|sqft|sqm|abbr=}} in area and {{Convert|5.25|ft|m|abbr=}} in height. The walls of the [[cella]] recede {{Convert|2|ft|m|abbr=}} from the edge of the plinth. The temple is surrounded by a quadrangle which measures {{Convert|142|ft|m|abbr=}} by {{Convert|94|ft|m|abbr=}}. The quadrangle is enclosed by walls of {{Convert|11|ft|m|abbr=}} in height and {{Convert|6|ft|m|abbr=}} in width. On the north, east, and south, the walls of the [[cella]] are adorned by [[Trefoil arch|Trefoil arches]] and supporting [[Pilaster|pilasters]], which are constructed in high relief, rising higher than either the walls or pillars. Below these are small, trefoil-headed niches covered by double [[Pediment|pediments]]. Although a pyramidal stone roof is more typical to Kashmiri architecture, in Stein's description, the temple is covered by a low [[shingle roof]]. By the 21st century, the roof is no longer present and the interior of the temple is exposed to the elements. The temple appears imposing even from outside the walled enclosure, because of the plinths it is raised on to equalise the uneven elevations of the ground. The north side of the wall contained a small recess, in which two ancient [[Lingam|''linga'']] could be seen.\n\nThe interior of the cella is plain, and forms a square of {{Convert|12.25|ft|m|abbr=}} on each side. It houses a large slab of stone measuring {{Convert|6|ft|m|abbr=}} by {{Convert|7|ft|m|abbr=}}. This slab covers the holy spring where the goddess Sharada is believed to have appeared to rishi Shandilya. In the 19th century, this sacred spot was surmounted by a red cloth canopy and tinsel. The remainder of the interior was filled with ornaments of worship such as conches and bells. <ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":22\" />\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[\u015a\u0101rad\u0101 script]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|colwidth=50em}}\n*{{Cite book\n|last=Pollock\n|first=Sheldon\n|year=2006\n|title=Language of the Gods in the World of Men\n|publisher=University of California Press\n|ref=harv\n}}.\n*{{cite book |last1=Chitkara |first1=M.G |title=Kashmir Shaivism: Under Siege |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5CK0DFijayQC&pg=PA273#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=13 August 2012 |edition=2002 |publisher=A.P.H.Publishing Corporation |location= New Delhi|isbn=8176483605 |year=2002 }}\n*{{cite book |last=Pandit |first=Bansi|title=Explore Kashmiri Pandits |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zsoC6GWr47QC&pg=PA84#v=onepage&q=sharda&f=false |accessdate=13 August 2012 |edition=2008 |publisher=Dharma Publications |location=USA |language= |isbn=0963479865 }}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Sharada Peeth}}\n*[http://www.pbase.com/hgharib/shardatemple Photo gallery of Sharada Peeth]\n\n{{Ancient Dharmic centres of Higher Learning|state=expanded}}\n{{Hindu temples in Pakistan}}\n{{Cultural heritage sites in Azad Kashmir}}\n\n[[Category:Adi Shankara]]\n[[Category:Destroyed temples]]\n[[Category:Buddhist universities and colleges]]\n[[Category:Hindu pilgrimage sites in Pakistan]]\n[[Category:Hindu temples in Pakistan]]\n[[Category:History of Pakistan]]\n[[Category:History of Kashmir]]\n[[Category:Kashmiri Brahmins]]\n[[Category:Saraswati temples]]\n[[Category:Ancient universities of the Indian subcontinent]]\n[[Category:Forts in Azad Kashmir]]\n[[Category:Neelam District]]\n[[Category:Archaeological sites in Azad Kashmir]]\n", "text_old": "{{pp-protected|reason=Persistent [[WP:Disruptive editing|disruptive editing]]|small=yes}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2018}}\n{{Use Pakistani English|date=March 2018}}\n\n{{Infobox religious building\n| name                  = Sharada Peeth\n| native_name           = {{plainlist}}\n* {{nq|\u0634\u0627\u0631\u062f\u0627 \u067e\u06cc\u0679\u06be}}\n* \u0936\u093e\u0930\u0926\u093e \u092a\u0940\u0920\n* \ud804\uddaf\ud804\uddb3\ud804\uddab\ud804\udda2\ud804\uddb3 \ud804\udda5\ud804\uddb5\ud804\udd9c\n{{endplainlist}}\n| native_name_lang      = Kashmiri\n| image                 = [[File:Sharda Fort, Azad Jammu & Kashmir.jpg|centre|frameless|350x350px]]\n| image_upright         = \n| alt                   = \n| caption               = Ruins of Sharada Peeth\n| image2                = \n| caption2              =\n| map_type              = Kashmir#Pakistan\n| map_size              =  \n| map_alt               = \n| map_relief            = \n| map_caption           = Sharada Peeth\n| coordinates           = {{coord|34|47|31|N|74|11|24|E|display=inline}}\n| coordinates_footnotes =\n| religious_affiliation = [[Hinduism]]\n| locale                = \n| location              = [[Sharda, Azad Kashmir|Sharda]], [[Azad Kashmir]]\n| deity                 = [[Saraswati|Sharada]]\n| rite                  = [[Shaktism]], [[Shaivism]], [[Vedism]] \n| sect                  = \n| tradition             = \n| festival              = <!-- or | festivals = -->\n| cercle                = \n| sector                = \n| municipality          = \n| district              = [[Neelam Valley]]\n| territory             = [[Azad Kashmir]]\n| prefecture            = \n| state                 = \n| province              = \n| region                = \n| country               = [[Pakistan]]\n| administration        = \n| consecration_year     = \n| organisational_status = <!-- or | organizational_status = -->\n| functional_status     = \n| heritage_designation  = Undesignated\n| ownership             = \n| governing_body        = \n| leadership            = \n| bhattaraka            = \n| patron                = \n| website               = \n| architect             = \n| architecture_type     = \n| architecture_style    = Kashmiri<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://heritage-india.com/medieval-stone-temples-of-kashmir/|title=The Unexplored Medieval Stone Temples of Kashmir|last=Singh|first=Rajesh|website=Heritage India Magazine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180925035448/https://heritage-india.com/medieval-stone-temples-of-kashmir/|archive-date=25 September 2018|url-status=|access-date=25 September 2018|quote=However, a few still stand in different states of preservation at places like Martand, Avantipur, Pattan, Buniar, Pandrethan and Payar, reflecting not only the remarkable temple construction activity that once existed in Kashmir but also showcasing a distinct architectural style.

It recounts the ''[[rishi]]'' Shandilya as performing a grand ''[[Yajna]]'' in the Sharda area, involving the local people and hundreds of worthy priests. During the ''Yajna'', a beautiful woman appeared, introducing herself as a [[Brahmin]]i who wished to participate. She said that she and her companion had come a long way and asked for food. Shandilya welcomed her and told her that the rules of the ''Yajna'' forbade him from giving her the food: the ''Yajna'' had to be completed, and the ''Purohits'' fed first. The Brahmini grew angry and declared herself to be [[V\u0101c]], the Vedic goddess and [[Adi Parashakti|Divine Mother]]. She revealed to him that the [[Paramatman]] he worshipped was the essence of the goddess. In her anger, she transformed before him into the divine ''Neela'' (or ''blue'') form of [[Saraswati]], with ornaments, weapons, and clouds, and declared that she would absorb the world. In shock, remorse and fear, Shandilya collapsed and died. Seeing his remorse, the goddess had him revived with ''[[Amrita]]'', the elixir of life, and transformed into a different, graceful form of Saraswati. Addressing him as \"son\", she told him that she was pleased with his devotion and compassion and would grant him whatever he wished. Shandilya, addressing her as the Divine Mother, asked her to revive the dead and restore the village and forest. Saraswati did so, instructing him to build his [[ashram]] at the base of the hill near the Madhumati river (present-day Neelum River). She took her abode there at Sharada Peeth.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Tikkoo|first=Brij Nath|url=https://archive.org/details/ShriSharadaMahatmyaBrijNathTikkoo|title=Shri Sharada Mahatmya|publisher=Vikas Printing Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=Ajmer|pages=(ii), 1, 7\u201313}}</ref>\n\nAn alternative account holds that Shandilya prayed to the goddess Sharada with great devotion, and was rewarded when she appeared to him and promised to show him her real, divine form. She advised him to look for the Sharada forest, and his journey was filled with miraculous experiences. On his way, he had a vision of the god [[Ganesha]] on the eastern side of a hill. When he reached the Neelum river, he bathed in it and saw half his body turn golden. Eventually, the goddess revealed herself to him in her triple form of Sharada, Saraswati and Vagdevi, and invited him to her abode.

These princes, pursued by the Royal Army, sought refuge in the upper Kishenganga Valley, in the Sirahsila Castle.

These included priests and traders, as well as saints and their disciples. As a religious ritual, Kashmiri Pandit theologians across Kashmir would place their manuscripts in covered platters before idols of the goddess Sharada, to obtain her blessings. They believed that the goddess would convey approval of the pages of writings by leaving them undisturbed, and disapproval by leaving the pages ruffled. In addition, an annual fair would be held at Shardi village, with pilgrims travelling through [[Kupwara]] (in present-day Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir), in worship of the goddess Sharada.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ikashmir.net/sharda/sharda5.html|title=Kashmir: Religious Practices|website=ikashmir.net|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref> Kashmiri Pandits believe that the Sharada pilgrimage parallels Shandilya's journey, and that the act of bathing in the confluence of the Neelum River and Madhumati stream cleanses the pilgrim of their sins.<ref name=\":32\" /> In 1947, the Kashmiri saint Swami Nand Lal Ji moved some of the stone idols to Tikker in [[Kupwara]].

Historical records of the temple's architecture are scarce. A late 19th century account by [[Aurel Stein]] describes the temple's walls as intact to a height of approximately {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=}}, and its pillars rising approximately {{Convert|16|ft|m|abbr=}}. [[File:Sharada_temple.Stein1893.jpg|alt=|thumb|280x280px|A photograph of Sharada Peeth in 1893 by [[Aurel Stein|Sir Aurel Stein]]. A Kashmiri Pandit stands at the entrance]]\nThe compound is situated on a hill, and is approached on its west side, through an imposing stone staircase. The facades are repetitive, possibly because architects disliked plain outside walls, or else possibly so that even if the spire collapsed, a visitor would be able to tell what the temple originally looked like. The design is simple, with a plain conical Sharada spire. The temple sits on a raised [[plinth]], {{Convert|24|sqft|sqm|abbr=}} in area and {{Convert|5.25|ft|m|abbr=}} in height. The walls of the [[cella]] recede {{Convert|2|ft|m|abbr=}} from the edge of the plinth. The temple is surrounded by a quadrangle which measures {{Convert|142|ft|m|abbr=}} by {{Convert|94|ft|m|abbr=}}. The quadrangle is enclosed by walls of {{Convert|11|ft|m|abbr=}} in height and {{Convert|6|ft|m|abbr=}} in width. On the north, east, and south, the walls of the [[cella]] are adorned by [[Trefoil arch|Trefoil arches]] and supporting [[Pilaster|pilasters]], which are constructed in high relief, rising higher than either the walls or pillars. Below these are small, trefoil-headed niches covered by double [[Pediment|pediments]]. Although a pyramidal stone roof is more typical to Kashmiri architecture, in Stein's description, the temple is covered by a low [[shingle roof]]. By the 21st century, the roof is no longer present and the interior of the temple is exposed to the elements. The temple appears imposing even from outside the walled enclosure, because of the plinths it is raised on to equalise the uneven elevations of the ground. The north side of the wall contained a small recess, in which two ancient [[Lingam|''linga'']] could be seen.\n\nThe interior of the cella is plain, and forms a square of {{Convert|12.25|ft|m|abbr=}} on each side. It houses a large slab of stone measuring {{Convert|6|ft|m|abbr=}} by {{Convert|7|ft|m|abbr=}}. This slab covers the holy spring where the goddess Sharada is believed to have appeared to rishi Shandilya. In the 19th century, this sacred spot was surmounted by a red cloth canopy and tinsel. The remainder of the interior was filled with ornaments of worship such as conches and bells. <ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":22\" />\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[\u015a\u0101rad\u0101 script]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|colwidth=50em}}\n*{{Cite book\n|last=Pollock\n|first=Sheldon\n|year=2006\n|title=Language of the Gods in the World of Men\n|publisher=University of California Press\n|ref=harv\n}}.\n*{{cite book |last1=Chitkara |first1=M.G |title=Kashmir Shaivism: Under Siege |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5CK0DFijayQC&pg=PA273#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=13 August 2012 |edition=2002 |publisher=A.P.H.Publishing Corporation |location= New Delhi|isbn=8176483605 |year=2002 }}\n*{{cite book |last=Pandit |first=Bansi|title=Explore Kashmiri Pandits |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zsoC6GWr47QC&pg=PA84#v=onepage&q=sharda&f=false |accessdate=13 August 2012 |edition=2008 |publisher=Dharma Publications |location=USA |language= |isbn=0963479865 }}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Sharada Peeth}}\n*[http://www.pbase.com/hgharib/shardatemple Photo gallery of Sharada Peeth]\n\n{{Ancient Dharmic centres of Higher Learning|state=expanded}}\n{{Hindu temples in Pakistan}}\n{{Cultural heritage sites in Azad Kashmir}}\n\n[[Category:Adi Shankara]]\n[[Category:Destroyed temples]]\n[[Category:Buddhist universities and colleges]]\n[[Category:Hindu pilgrimage sites in Pakistan]]\n[[Category:Hindu temples in Pakistan]]\n[[Category:History of Pakistan]]\n[[Category:History of Kashmir]]\n[[Category:Kashmiri Brahmins]]\n[[Category:Saraswati temples]]\n[[Category:Ancient universities of the Indian subcontinent]]\n[[Category:Forts in Azad Kashmir]]\n[[Category:Neelam District]]\n[[Category:Archaeological sites in Azad Kashmir]]\n", "name_user": "Trappist the monk", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAs a temple:cite repair;", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharada_Peeth"}

These trusts have consisted of shares in the successor companies to [[Standard Oil]] and other diversified investments, as well as the family's considerable real estate holdings. They are administered by a trust committee that oversees the fortune.\n\nManagement of this fortune today also rests with professional money managers who oversee the principal holding company, ''Rockefeller Financial Services'', which controls all the family's investments, now that [[Rockefeller Center]] is no longer owned by the family.

[[John D. Rockefeller Jr.|John Jr.]], and his son [[Laurance Rockefeller|Laurance]] (and his son Laurance Jr. aka Larry) were particularly prominent in this area.\n\nThe family was honored for its conservation efforts in November 2005, by the [[National Audubon Society]], one of America's largest and oldest conservation organizations, at which over 30 family members attended. At the event, the society's president, John Flicker, notably stated: \"Cumulatively, no other family in America has made the contribution to conservation that the Rockefeller family has made\".<ref name=\"NYT2005-11-15\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/15/nyregion/15rockefeller.html|title=They Saved Land Like Rockefellers|work=The New York Times|date=November 15, 2005|accessdate=March 23, 2008 | first=Anthony | last=Depalma}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016 fifth-generation descendants of John Sr. criticized [[ExxonMobil]], one of the successors to his company [[Standard Oil]], for their record on climate change.

In many cases, songs celebrate individual cities, presenting them as exciting and liberating. Not all genres share the tendency to be positive about cities; in [[Country music]] cities are often portrayed as unfriendly and dehumanizing, or seductive but full of sin.<ref name=\"decline\"/><ref name=\"place\"/> However, there are many exceptions, for example: [[Lady Antebellum]]'s song \u2018This City\u2019, [[Danielle Bradbery]]'s \u2018[[Young in America]]\u2019, and many others.\n\nLyricist and author Sheila Davis writes that including a city in a song's title helps focus the song on the concrete and specific, which is both more appealing and more likely to lead to universal truth than abstract generalizations. Davis also says that songs with titles concerning cities and other specific places often have enduring popularity.<ref>\n{{cite book \n|first = Sheila|last = Davis\n|title=The Songwriter's Idea

In many cases, songs celebrate individual cities, presenting them as exciting and liberating. Not all genres share the tendency to be positive about cities; in [[Country music]] cities are often portrayed as unfriendly and dehumanizing, or seductive but full of sin.<ref name=\"decline\"/><ref name=\"place\"/> However, there are many exceptions, for example: [[Lady Antebellum]]'s song \u2018This City\u2019, [[Danielle Bradbery]]'s \u2018[[Young in America]]\u2019, and many others.\n\nLyricist and author Sheila Davis writes that including a city in a song's title helps focus the song on the concrete and specific, which is both more appealing and more likely to lead to universal truth than abstract generalizations. Davis also says that songs with titles concerning cities and other specific places often have enduring popularity.<ref>\n{{cite book \n|first = Sheila|last = Davis\n|title=The Songwriter's Idea
