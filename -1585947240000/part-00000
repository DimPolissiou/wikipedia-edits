Simple [[commodity]] exchange and consequently simple commodity production, which is the initial basis for the growth of capital from trade, have a very long history. [[Classical Islam|Arabs]] promulgated capitalist economic policies such as free trade and banking. Their use of [[Indo-Arabic numerals]] facilitated [[bookkeeping]].  These innovations migrated to Europe through trade partners in cities such as Venice and Pisa.  The Italian mathematician [[Fibonacci]] traveled the Mediterranean talking to Arab traders and returned to popularize the use of Indo-Arabic numerals in Europe.<ref name=\"Koehler, Benedikt\">Koehler, Benedikt.

That required a set of conditions, including specific technologies of mass production, the ability to independently and privately own and trade in means of production, a class of workers willing to sell their [[labor power]] for a living, a [[legal]] framework promoting commerce, a physical infrastructure allowing the circulation of goods on a large scale and security for private accumulation. Many of these conditions do not currently exist in many [[Third World]] countries, although there is plenty of capital and labor. The obstacles for the development of capitalist markets are therefore less technical and more social, cultural and political.\n\n=== Agrarianism ===\nThe economic foundations of the feudal agricultural system began to shift substantially in 16th-century England as the [[manorial system]] had broken down and land began to become concentrated in the hands of fewer landlords with increasingly large estates. Instead of a [[serf]]-based system of labor, workers were increasingly employed as part of a broader and expanding money-based economy. The system put pressure on both landlords and tenants to increase the productivity of agriculture to make profit; the weakened coercive power of the [[aristocracy]] to extract peasant [[Excess supply|surpluses]] encouraged them to try better methods, and the tenants also had incentive to improve their methods in order to flourish in a competitive [[labor economics|labor market]]. Terms of rent for land were becoming subject to economic market forces rather than to the previous stagnant system of custom and feudal obligation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brenner|first1=Robert|title=The Agrarian Roots of European Capitalism|journal=Past & Present|date=1 January 1982|issue=97|pages=16\u2013113|jstor=650630}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://monthlyreview.org/1998/07/01/the-agrarian-origins-of-capitalism|title= The Agrarian Origins of Capitalism|accessdate= 17 December 2012|date= July 1998}}</ref>\n\nBy the early 17th century, England was a centralized state in which much of the feudal order of [[Medieval Europe]] had been swept away. This centralization was strengthened by a good system of roads and by a disproportionately large capital city, [[London]].

Moderate critics have recently challenged this, stating that the current influence lobbying groups have had on policy in the United States is a contradiction, given the approval of [[Citizens United (organization)|Citizens United]]. This has led people to question the idea that competitive capitalism promotes political freedom. The ruling on Citizens United allows corporations to spend undisclosed and unregulated amounts of money on political campaigns, shifting outcomes to the interests and undermining true democracy. As explained in [[Robin Hahnel]]\u2019s writings, the centerpiece of the ideological defense of the free market system is the concept of economic freedom and that supporters equate economic democracy with economic freedom and claim that only the free market system can provide economic freedom. According to Hahnel, there are a few objections to the premise that capitalism offers freedom through economic freedom. These objections are guided by critical questions about who or what decides whose freedoms are more protected. Often, the question of inequality is brought up when discussing how well capitalism promotes democracy. An argument that could stand is that economic growth can lead to inequality given that capital can be acquired at different rates by different people. In ''[[Capital in the Twenty-First Century]]'', [[Thomas Piketty]] of the [[Paris School of Economics]] asserts that inequality is the inevitable consequence of economic growth in a capitalist economy and the resulting [[Wealth concentration|concentration of wealth]] can destabilize democratic societies and undermine the ideals of social justice upon which they are built.<ref>[[Thomas Piketty|Piketty, Thomas]] (2014).

In mixed economies, which are almost universal today,<ref>James Fulcher, ''Capitalism A Very Short Introduction'', \"...in the wake of the 1970 crisis, the neoliberal model of capitalism became intellectually and ideologically dominant\", p. 58, Oxford, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-19-280218-7}}.</ref> markets continue to play a dominant role, but they are regulated to some extent by the state in order to correct [[market failure]]s, promote [[social welfare]], conserve [[natural resource]]s, fund [[military|defense]] and [[public safety]] or other rationale. In [[State capitalism|state capitalist]] systems, markets are relied upon the least, with the state relying heavily on [[state-owned enterprises]] or indirect economic planning to accumulate capital.\n\nSupply is the amount of a good or service that is available for purchase or sale. Demand is the measure of value for a good that people are willing to buy at a given time. Prices tend to rise when demand for an available resource increases or its supply diminishes and fall with demand or when supply increases.{{According to whom|date=March 2020}}{{Fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nCompetition arises when more than one producer is trying to sell the same or similar products to the same buyers. Adherents of the capitalist theory believe that competition leads to innovation and more affordable prices. [[Monopoly|Monopolies]] or [[cartels]] can develop, especially if there is no competition. A monopoly occurs when a firm is granted exclusivity over a market. Hence, the firm can engage in [[rent seeking]] behaviors such as limiting output and raising prices because it has no fear of competition. A cartel is a group of firms that act together in a monopolistic manner to control output and prices.\n\nGovernments have implemented legislation for the purpose of preventing the creation of monopolies and cartels. In 1890, the Sherman Antitrust Act became the first legislation passed by the United States Congress to limit monopolies.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monopoly.asp|title=Monopoly|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=24 November 2003|work=Investopedia|access-date=2 March 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Profit motive ===\n{{Main|Profit motive}}\nThe [[profit motive]], in the theory in capitalism, is the desire to earn income in the form of profit. Stated differently, the reason for a business's existence is to turn a profit. The profit motive functions according to [[rational choice theory]], or the theory that individuals tend to pursue what is in their own best interests. Accordingly, businesses seek to benefit themselves and/or their shareholders by maximizing profit.\n\nIn capitalist theoretics, the profit motive is said to ensure that resources are being allocated efficiently. For instance, [[Austrian economist]] [[Henry Hazlitt]] explains: \"If there is no profit in making an article, it is a sign that the labor and capital devoted to its production are misdirected: the value of the resources that must be used up in making the article is greater than the value of the article itself\".<ref>Hazlitt, Henry. \"The Function of Profits\". ''Economics in One Lesson''. Ludwig Von Mises Institute. Web. 22 April 2013.</ref> In other words, profits let companies know whether an item is worth producing. Theoretically{{according to whom|date=March 2020}}, in free and competitive markets maximising profit ensures that resources are not wasted.\n\n=== Private property ===\n{{Main|Private property}}\nThe relationship between the [[state (polity)|state]], its formal mechanisms and capitalist societies has been debated in many fields of social and political theory, with active discussion since the 19th century. [[Hernando de Soto (economist)|Hernando de Soto]] is a contemporary Peruvian economist who has argued that an important characteristic of capitalism is the functioning state protection of property rights in a formal property system where ownership and transactions are clearly recorded.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2001/03/desoto.htm |title=The mystery of capital|author=Hernando de Soto|accessdate=26 February 2008}}</ref>\n\nAccording to de Soto, this is the process by which physical assets are transformed into capital, which in turn may be used in many more ways and much more efficiently in the market economy. A number of Marxian economists have argued that the [[Enclosure Acts]] in England and similar legislation elsewhere were an integral part of capitalist [[primitive accumulation]] and that specific legal frameworks of private land ownership have been integral to the development of capitalism.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch27.htm |title=Capital, v. 1.

Private money-making in various forms (renting, banking, merchant trade, production for profit and so on) preceded the development of the capitalist mode of production as such. The capitalist mode of production proper based on wage-labour and private ownership of the means of production and on industrial technology began to grow rapidly in Western Europe from the [[Industrial Revolution]], later extending to most of the world.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe term capitalist mode of production is defined by [[Private property|private ownership]] of the [[means of production]], extraction of [[surplus value]] by the owning class for the purpose of [[capital accumulation]], [[Wage labour|wage-based labour]] and at least as far as [[Commodity|commodities]] are concerned being [[Market economy|market-based]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/c/a.htm#capitalism | title=Capitalism. | publisher=marxists.org | accessdate=8 July 2011 | author=Encyclopedia of Marxism at marxism.org}}</ref>\n\nCapitalism in the form of money-making activity has existed in the shape of merchants and money-lenders who acted as intermediaries between consumers and producers engaging in [[simple commodity production]] (hence the reference to \"[[merchant capitalism]]\") since the beginnings of civilisation. What is specific about the \"capitalist mode of production\" is that most of the inputs and outputs of production are supplied through the market (i.e. they are commodities) and essentially all production is in this mode.<ref name=\"Modern Economics 1986, p. 54\" /> For example, in flourishing feudalism most or all of the factors of production including labour are owned by the feudal ruling class outright and the products may also be consumed without a market of any kind, it is production for use within the feudal social unit and for limited trade.<ref name=ch32/> This has the important consequence that the whole organisation of the production process is reshaped and re-organised to conform with economic [[bounded rationality|rationality as bounded]] by capitalism, which is expressed in price relationships between inputs and outputs (wages, non-labour factor costs, sales and profits) rather than the larger rational context faced by society overall\u2014that is, the whole process is organised and re-shaped in order to conform to \"commercial logic\".

It posulates that in a [[perfect competition|perfectly competitive market]], the [[unit price]] for a particular [[Good (economics)|good]] will vary until it settles at a point where the quantity demanded by consumers (at the current price) will equal the quantity supplied by producers (at the current price), resulting in an [[economic equilibrium]] for price and [[Output (economics)|quantity]].\n\nThe four basic \"laws\" of [[Supply (economics)|supply]] and [[demand]], as described by [[David Besanko]] and [[Ronald Braeutigam]], are:<ref name=\"besanko-and-braeutigam-2010\">{{Cite book | last = Besanko | first = David | last2 = Braeutigam | first2 = Ronald | year = 2010 | title = Microeconomics | publisher = Wiley | edition = 4th }}</ref>{{rp|37}}\n# If demand increases (demand curve shifts to the right) and supply remains unchanged, then a shortage occurs, leading to a higher equilibrium price.\n# If demand decreases (demand curve shifts to the left) and supply remains unchanged, then a surplus occurs, leading to a lower equilibrium price.\n# If demand remains unchanged and supply increases (supply curve shifts to the right), then a surplus occurs, leading to a lower equilibrium price.\n# If demand remains unchanged and supply decreases (supply curve shifts to the left), then a shortage occurs, leading to a higher equilibrium price.\n\n=== Graphical representation ===\nAlthough it is normal to regard the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied as [[function (mathematics)|functions]] of the price of the goods, the standard graphical representation, usually attributed to [[Alfred Marshall]], has price on the vertical axis and quantity on the horizontal axis, the opposite of the standard convention for the representation of a mathematical function.\n\nSince determinants of supply and demand other than the price of the goods in question are not explicitly represented in the supply-demand diagram, changes in the values of these variables are represented by moving the supply and demand curves (often described as \"shifts\" in the curves). By contrast, responses to changes in the price of the good are represented as movements along unchanged supply and demand curves.\n\n==== Supply schedule ====\nA supply schedule is a table that shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied. Under the assumption of [[perfect competition]], supply is determined by [[marginal cost]]. That is: firms will produce additional output while the cost of producing an extra unit of output is less than the price they would receive.\n\nA hike in the cost of raw goods would decrease supply and shifting costs up while a discount would increase supply, shifting costs down and hurting producers as producer surplus decreases.\n\nBy its very nature, conceptualising a supply curve requires the firm to be a perfect competitor (i.e. to have no influence over the market price). This is true because each point on the supply curve is the answer to the question \"If this firm is ''faced with'' this potential price, how much output will it be able to and willing to sell?\". If a firm has market power, its decision of how much output to provide to the market influences the market price, therefore the firm is not \"faced with\" any price and the question becomes less relevant.\n\nEconomists distinguish between the supply curve of an individual firm and the market supply curve. The market supply curve is obtained by summing the quantities supplied by all suppliers at each potential price, thus in the graph of the supply curve individual firms' supply curves are added horizontally to obtain the market supply curve.\n\nEconomists also distinguish the short-run market supply curve from the long-run market supply curve. In this context, two things are assumed constant by definition of the short run: the availability of one or more fixed inputs (typically [[physical capital]]) and the number of firms in the industry. In the long-run, firms can adjust their holdings of physical capital, enabling them to better adjust their quantity supplied at any given price. Furthermore, in the long-run potential competitors can [[Market entry strategy|enter]] or exit the industry in response to market conditions. For both of these reasons, long-run market supply curves are generally flatter than their short-run counterparts.\n\nThe determinants of supply are:\n# Production costs: how much a goods costs to be produced. Production costs are the cost of the inputs; primarily labor, capital, energy and materials. They depend on the technology used in production and/or technological advances. See [[productivity]].\n# Firms' expectations about future prices.\n# Number of suppliers.\n\n==== Demand schedule ====\nA demand schedule, depicted graphically as the [[demand curve]], represents the amount of some [[Good (economics)|goods]] that buyers are willing and able to purchase at various prices, assuming all determinants of demand other than the price of the good in question, such as income, tastes and preferences, the price of [[substitute good]]s and the price of [[complementary good]]s, remain the same. According to the [[law of demand]], the demand curve is almost always represented as downward-sloping, meaning that as price decreases, consumers will buy more of the good.<ref name=\"axes\">Note that unlike most [[Graph of a function|graphs]], supply & demand curves are plotted with the independent variable (price) on the vertical axis and the dependent variable (quantity supplied or demanded) on the horizontal axis.</ref>\n\nJust like the supply curves reflect [[marginal cost]] curves, demand curves are determined by [[marginal utility]] curves.<ref>{{cite web|title=Marginal Utility and Demand|url=http://www.amosweb.com/cgi-bin/awb_nav.pl?s=wpd&c=dsp&k=marginal+utility+and+demand|accessdate=9 February 2007}}</ref> Consumers will be willing to buy a given quantity of a good at a given price, if the marginal utility of additional consumption is equal to the [[opportunity cost]] determined by the price\u2014that is, the marginal utility of alternative consumption choices. The demand schedule is defined as the willingness and ability of a consumer to purchase a given product in a given frame of time.\n\nWhile the aforementioned demand curve is generally downward-sloping, there may be rare examples of goods that have upward-sloping demand curves. Two different hypothetical types of goods with upward-sloping demand curves are [[Giffen good]]s (an inferior, but [[Staple food|staple]] good) and [[Veblen good]]s (goods made more fashionable by a higher price).\n\nBy its very nature, conceptualising a demand curve requires that the purchaser be a perfect competitor\u2014that is, that the purchaser has no influence over the market price. This is true because each point on the demand curve is the answer to the question \"If this buyer is faced with this potential price, how much of the product will it purchase?\". If a buyer has market power, so its decision of how much to buy influences the market price, then the buyer is not \"faced with\" any price and the question is meaningless.\n\nLike with supply curves, economists distinguish between the demand curve of an individual and the market demand curve. The market demand curve is obtained by summing the quantities demanded by all consumers at each potential price, thus in the graph of the demand curve individuals' demand curves are added horizontally to obtain the market demand curve.\n\nThe determinants of demand are:\n# Income.\n# Tastes and preferences.\n# Prices of related goods and services.\n# Consumers' expectations about future prices and incomes that can be checked.\n# Number of potential consumers.\n\n=== Equilibrium ===\n{{Further|Economic equilibrium}}\nIn the context of supply and demand, economic equilibrium refers to a state where economic forces such as [[supply and demand]] are balanced and in the absence of external influences the ([[:wikt:equilibrium|equilibrium]]) values of economic variables will not change. For example, in the standard text-book model of [[perfect competition]] equilibrium occurs at the point at which quantity demanded and quantity supplied are equal.<ref>{{cite book |authorlink=Hal Varian |first=Hal R. |last=Varian |title=Microeconomic Analysis |edition=Third |publisher=Norton |location=New York |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-393-95735-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/microeconomicana00vari_0 }}</ref> Market equilibrium in this case refers to a condition where a market price is established through competition such that the amount of goods or services sought by [[Law of supply and demand|buyers]] is equal to the amount of goods or services produced by [[Law of supply and demand|sellers]]. This price is often called the competitive price or [[market clearing]] price and will tend not to change unless demand or supply changes and the quantity is called \"competitive quantity\" or market clearing quantity.\n\n=== Partial equilibrium ===\n{{Main|Partial equilibrium}}\nPartial equilibrium, as the name suggests, takes into consideration only a part of the market to attain equilibrium.\n\nJain proposes (attributed to [[George Stigler]]): \"A partial equilibrium is one which is based on only a restricted range of data, a standard example is price of a single product, the prices of all other products being held fixed during the analysis\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Jain|first=T.R.|title=Microeconomics and Basic Mathematics|year=2006|publisher=VK Publications|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-81-87140-89-4|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fUUoFwco2Z8C}}</ref>\n\nThe supply and demand model is a partial equilibrium model of [[economic equilibrium]], where the clearance on the [[Market (economics)|market]] of some specific [[good (economics)|goods]] is obtained independently from prices and quantities in other markets. In other words, the prices of all [[substitute good|substitutes]] and [[complement good|complements]] as well as [[income]] levels of [[consumer]]s are constant. This makes analysis much simpler than in a [[general equilibrium]] model which includes an entire economy.\n\nHere the dynamic process is that prices adjust until supply equals demand. It is a powerfully simple technique that allows one to study [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]], [[Pareto Efficiency|efficiency]] and [[comparative statics]]. The stringency of the simplifying assumptions inherent in this approach make the model considerably more tractable, but it may produce results which while seemingly precise do not effectively model real world economic phenomena.\n\nPartial equilibrium analysis examines the effects of policy action in creating equilibrium only in that particular sector or market which is directly affected, ignoring its effect in any other market or industry assuming that they being small will have little impact if any.\n\nHence this analysis is considered to be useful in constricted markets.\n\n[[L\u00e9on Walras]] first formalised the idea of a one-period economic equilibrium of the general economic system, but it was French economist [[Antoine Augustin Cournot]] and English political economist [[Alfred Marshall]] who developed tractable models to analyse an economic system.\n\n=== Empirical estimation ===\nDemand and supply relations in a market can be statistically estimated from price, quantity and other [[data]] with sufficient information in the model. This can be done with [[System of linear equations|simultaneous-equation]] methods of estimation in [[econometrics]]. Such methods allow solving for the model-relevant \"structural coefficients\", the estimated algebraic counterparts of the theory. The [[Identification (parameter)|parameter identification problem]] is a common issue in \"structural estimation\". Typically, data on [[exogenous variable]]s (that is, variables other than price and quantity, both of which are [[endogenous variable]]s) are needed to perform such an estimation. An alternative to \"structural estimation\" is [[Reduced form|reduced-form]] estimation, which regresses each of the endogenous variables on the respective exogenous variables.\n\n=== Macroeconomic uses of demand and supply ===\nDemand and supply have also been generalised to explain [[macroeconomic]] variables in a [[market economy]], including the [[Real GDP|quantity of total output]] and the general [[price level]]. The [[AD-AS model|Aggregate Demand\u2013Aggregate Supply model]] may be the most direct application of supply and demand to macroeconomics, but other macroeconomic models also use supply and demand. Compared to [[microeconomic]] uses of demand and supply, different (and more controversial) theoretical considerations apply to such [[macroeconomic]] counterparts as [[aggregate demand]] and [[aggregate supply]]. Demand and supply are also used in macroeconomic theory to relate [[money supply]] and money demand to [[interest rate]]s and to relate labor supply and labor demand to wage rates.\n\n=== History ===\nAccording to Hamid S. Hosseini, the \"power of supply and demand\" was discussed to some extent by several early Muslim scholars, such as fourteenth-century [[Mamluk]] scholar [[Ibn Taymiyyah]], who wrote: \"If desire for goods increases while its availability decreases, its price rises. On the other hand, if availability of the good increases and the desire for it decreases, the price comes down\".<ref name=Hosseini>{{cite book |title=A Companion to the History of Economic Thought |chapter=Contributions of Medieval Muslim Scholars to the History of Economics and their Impact: A Refutation of the Schumpeterian Great Gap |last=Hosseini |first=Hamid S. |editor=Biddle, Jeff E. |editor2=Davis, Jon B. |editor3=Samuels, Warren J. |year=2003 |publisher=Blackwell |location=Malden, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-631-22573-7 |doi=10.1002/9780470999059.ch3 |pages=28\u201345 [28 & 38]}} (citing Hamid S.

In this description, demand is [[Economic rent|rent]]: \"The price of any commodity rises or falls by the proportion of the number of buyer and sellers\" and \"that which regulates the price... [of goods] is nothing else but their quantity in proportion to their rent\".\n\nThe phrase \"supply and demand\" was first used by [[James Denham-Steuart]] in his ''Inquiry into the Principles of Political Economy'', published in 1767. [[Adam Smith]] used the phrase in his 1776 book ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', and [[David Ricardo]] titled one chapter of his 1817 work ''[[Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]]'' \"On the Influence of Demand and Supply on Price\".<ref name=Humphrey>Thomas M. Humphrey, 1992. \"Marshallian Cross Diagrams and Their Uses before Alfred Marshall\", ''Economic Review'', Mar/Apr, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond,  pp. [http://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_review/1992/pdf/er780201.pdf 3\u201323].</ref>\n\nIn ''The Wealth of Nations'', Smith generally assumed that the supply price was fixed, but that its \"merit\" (value) would decrease as its \"scarcity\" increased, in effect what was later called the law of demand also. In ''Principles of Political Economy and Taxation'', Ricardo more rigorously laid down the idea of the assumptions that were used to build his ideas of supply and demand. [[Antoine Augustin Cournot]] first developed a mathematical model of supply and demand in his 1838 ''Researches into the Mathematical Principles of Wealth'', including diagrams.\n\nDuring the late 19th century, the marginalist school of thought emerged. This field mainly was started by [[William Stanley Jevons|Stanley Jevons]], [[Carl Menger]] and [[L\u00e9on Walras]]. The key idea was that the price was set by the most expensive price\u2014that is, the price at the margin. This was a substantial change from Adam Smith's thoughts on determining the supply price.\n\nIn his 1870 essay \"On the Graphical Representation of Supply and Demand\", [[Fleeming Jenkin]] in the course of \"introduc[ing] the diagrammatic method into the English economic literature\" published the first drawing of supply and demand curves therein,<ref>A.D.

In most cases, the government does not prevent firms from determining what wages they will pay and what prices they will charge for their products. However, many countries have [[minimum wage]] laws and minimum safety standards.\n\nUnder some versions of capitalism, the government carries out a number of economic functions, such as issuing money, supervising public utilities, and enforcing private contracts. Many countries have [[competition law]]s that prohibit monopolies and cartels. Despite anti-monopoly laws, large corporations can form near-monopolies in some industries. Such firms can temporarily drop prices and accept losses to prevent competition from entering the market and then raise them again once the threat of competition is reduced. In many countries, public utilities such as electricity, heating fuel and communications are able to operate as a monopoly under government regulation due to high economies of scale.\n\nGovernment agencies regulate the standards of service in many industries, such as airlines and broadcasting, as well as financing a wide range of programs. In addition, the government regulates the flow of capital and uses financial tools such as the interest rate to control such factors as inflation and unemployment.<ref>\"Capitalism.\" World Book Encyclopedia. 1988. p. 194.</ref>\n\n=== Relationship to political freedom ===\nIn his book ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', [[Friedrich Hayek]] asserts that the free market understanding of [[economic freedom]] as present in capitalism is a requisite of [[political freedom]]. He argues that the market mechanism is the only way of deciding what to produce and how to distribute the items without using coercion. [[Milton Friedman]], [[Andrew Brennan (economist)|Andrew Brennan]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] also promoted this view. Friedman claimed that centralized economic operations are always accompanied by [[political repression]]. In his view, transactions in a market economy are voluntary and that the wide diversity that voluntary activity permits is a fundamental threat to repressive political leaders and greatly diminishes their power to coerce. Some of Friedman's views were shared by [[John Maynard Keynes]], who believed that capitalism is vital for freedom to survive and thrive.<ref>{{cite book |author=Friedrich Hayek|title=The Road to Serfdom|journal=Nature|volume=154|issue=3911|pages=473\u201374|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|year=1944|isbn=978-0-226-32061-8|bibcode=1944Natur.154..473C|doi=10.1038/154473a0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Bellamy, Richard|title=The Cambridge History of Twentieth-Century Political Thought|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-521-56354-3|page=60}}</ref> [[Freedom House]], an American think tank that conducts international research on, and advocates for, democracy, political freedom and human rights, has argued \"there is a high and statistically significant correlation between the level of political freedom [[Freedom in the World|as measured by Freedom House]] and economic freedom [[Index of Economic Freedom|as measured by the Wall Street Journal/Heritage Foundation survey]]\".<ref>Adrian Karatnycky.

They vary in their institutional makeup and by their economic policies. The common features among all the different forms of capitalism is that they are based on the production of goods and services for profit, predominantly market-based allocation of resources and they are structured upon the accumulation of capital. They include advanced capitalism, corporate capitalism, finance capitalism, free-market capitalism, mercantilism, social capitalism, state capitalism and welfare capitalism. Other variants of capitalism include [[anarcho-capitalism]], [[community capitalism]], [[humanistic capitalism]], [[neo-capitalism]], [[state monopoly capitalism]], [[Supercapitalism (modern)|supercapitalism]] and [[technocapitalism]].\n\n=== Advanced ===\n{{Main|Advanced capitalism}}\nAdvanced capitalism is the situation that pertains to a society in which the [[capitalist model]] has been integrated and developed deeply and extensively for a prolonged period. Various writers identify [[Antonio Gramsci]] as an influential early theorist of advanced capitalism, even if he did not use the term himself. In his writings, Gramsci sought to explain how capitalism had adapted to avoid the revolutionary overthrow that had seemed inevitable in the 19th century. At the heart of his explanation was the decline of raw coercion as a tool of class power, replaced by use of [[civil society]] institutions to manipulate public ideology in the capitalists' favour.<ref>Lears, T.J. Jackson (1985) \"The Concept of Cultural Hegemony\"</ref><ref>Holub, Renate (2005) ''Antonio Gramsci: Beyond Marxism and Postmodernism''</ref><ref>Boggs, Carl (2012) ''Ecology and Revolution: Global Crisis and the Political Challenge''</ref>\n\n[[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]] has been a major contributor to the analysis of advanced-capitalistic societies. Habermas observed four general features that characterise advanced capitalism:\n# Concentration of industrial activity in a few large firms.\n# Constant reliance on the state to stabilise the economic system.\n# A formally democratic government that legitimises the activities of the state and dissipates opposition to the system.\n# The use of nominal wage increases to pacify the most restless segments of the work force.<ref>Habermas, 1988: 37, 75.</ref>\n\n=== Corporate ===\n{{Main|Corporate capitalism}}\n{{See also|Crony capitalism|State monopoly capitalism}}\nCorporate capitalism is a free or mixed-market capitalist economy characterized by the dominance of hierarchical, bureaucratic corporations.\n\n=== Finance ===\n{{Main|Finance capitalism}}\n{{See also|Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)}}\nFinance capitalism is the subordination of processes of [[Production (economics)|production]] to the accumulation of [[money]] profits in a [[financial system]]. In their critique of capitalism, [[Marxism]] and [[Leninism]] both emphasise the role of [[Financial capital|finance capital]] as the determining and [[ruling-class]] interest in capitalist society, particularly in the [[Crisis of capitalism|latter stages]].<ref>[[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism]] [http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/ch03.htm ibid.

It typically entails support for highly [[Competition (economics)|competitive markets]] and [[private ownership]] of the [[means of production]]. ''Laissez-faire'' capitalism is a more extensive form of this free-market economy, but one in which the role of the state is limited to protecting [[Property rights (economics)|property rights]]. In [[Anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalist]] theory, property rights are protected by private firms and market-generated law. According to anarcho-capitalists, this entails property rights without statutory law through market-generated tort, contract and property law as well as the self-sustaining private industry.\n\n=== Mercantile ===\n{{Main|Mercantilism}}\n{{See also|Protectionism}}\n[[File:Lloyds Subscription Room edited.jpg|thumb|The subscription room at [[Lloyd's of London]] in the early 19th century]]\nMercantilism is a nationalist form of early capitalism that came into existence approximately in the late 16th century. It is characterized by the intertwining of national business interests to state-interest and imperialism; and consequently, the state apparatus is utilized to advance national business interests abroad. An example of this is colonists living in America who were only allowed to trade with and purchase goods from their respective mother countries (e.g. Britain, France and Portugal). Mercantilism was driven by the belief that the wealth of a nation is increased through a positive balance of trade with other nations\u2014it corresponds to the phase of capitalist development sometimes called the [[primitive accumulation of capital]].\n\n=== Social ===\n{{Main|Social market economy}}\n{{See also|Nordic model}}\nA social market economy is a free-market or mixed-market capitalist system, sometimes classified as a [[coordinated market economy]], where government intervention in price formation is kept to a minimum, but the state provides significant services in the area of social security, unemployment benefits and recognition of [[labor rights]] through national [[collective bargaining]] arrangements. This model is prominent in Western and Northern European countries as well as Japan, albeit in slightly different configurations. The vast majority of enterprises are privately owned in this economic model.\n\n[[Rhine capitalism]] is the contemporary model of capitalism and adaptation of the social market model that exists in continental Western Europe today.\n\n=== State ===\n{{Main|State capitalism}}\nState capitalism is a capitalist market economy dominated by state-owned enterprises, where the state enterprises are organized as commercial, profit-seeking businesses. The designation has been used broadly throughout the 20th century to designate a number of different economic forms, ranging from state-ownership in market economies to the command economies of the former [[Eastern Bloc]]. According to Aldo Musacchio, a professor at Harvard Business School, state capitalism is a system in which governments, whether democratic or autocratic, exercise a widespread influence on the economy either through direct ownership or various subsidies. Musacchio notes a number of differences between today's state capitalism and its predecessors. In his opinion, gone are the days when governments appointed bureaucrats to run companies: the world's largest state-owned enterprises are now traded on the public markets and kept in good health by large institutional investors. Contemporary state capitalism is associated with the [[East Asian model of capitalism]], [[dirigisme]] and the economy of Norway.<ref>{{cite news |last=Musacchio |first=Aldo |url=http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/802 |title=Economist Debates: State capitalism: Statements |work=The Economist}}</ref> Alternatively, [[Merriam-Webster]] defines state capitalism as \"an economic system in which private capitalism is modified by a varying degree of government ownership and control\".<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/state%20capitalism State capitalism].

Today, welfare capitalism is most often associated with the models of capitalism found in Central Mainland and Northern Europe such as the [[Nordic model]], [[social market economy]] and [[Rhine capitalism]]. In some cases, welfare capitalism exists within a mixed economy, but welfare states can and do exist independently of policies common to mixed economies such as [[state interventionism]] and extensive regulation.\n\nA mixed economy is a largely market-based capitalist economy consisting of both private and public ownership of the means of production and [[economic interventionism]] through macroeconomic policies intended to correct [[market failure]]s, reduce unemployment and keep inflation low. The degree of intervention in markets varies among different countries. Some mixed economies such as France under [[dirigisme]] also featured a degree of [[Indicative planning|indirect economic planning]] over a largely capitalist-based economy.\n\nMost modern capitalist economies are defined as mixed economies to some degree.\n\n== Capital accumulation ==\n{{Main|Capital accumulation}}\n{{Further|Money}}\nThe [[accumulation of capital]] is the process of \"making money\", or growing an initial sum of money through investment in production. Capitalism is based on the accumulation of capital, whereby [[financial capital]] is invested in order to make a profit and then reinvested into further production in a continuous process of accumulation. In Marxian economic theory, this dynamic is called the [[law of value]]. Capital accumulation forms the basis of capitalism, where economic activity is structured around the accumulation of [[Capital (economics)|capital]], defined as investment in order to realize a financial profit.<ref name=\"Economist definition\">{{cite news | title = Economics A\u2013Z: ''Capital'' | url = http://www.economist.com/economics-a-to-z/c#node-21529870 | website = [[economist.com|The Economist]] | accessdate = 25 March 2015 }}</ref> In this context, \"capital\" is defined as money or a financial asset invested for the purpose of making more money (whether in the form of profit, rent, interest, royalties, capital gain or some other kind of return).<ref name=\"MIA definition\">{{cite web | title = Encyclopedia of Marxism \u2013 Glossary of terms: ''Capital'' | url = http://marxists.org/glossary/terms/c/a.htm#capital | website = [[Marxists Internet Archive]] | accessdate = 25 March 2015 }}</ref>\n\nIn mainstream [[economics]], [[accounting]] and [[Marxian economics]], capital accumulation is often equated with [[investment (macroeconomics)|investment]] of profit income or saving, especially in [[real vs. nominal in economics|real]] capital goods. The concentration and centralisation of capital are two of the results of such accumulation. In modern [[macroeconomics]] and [[econometrics]], the phrase \"[[capital formation]]\" is often used in preference to \"accumulation\", though the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) refers nowadays to \"accumulation\". The term \u201caccumulation\u201d is occasionally used in [[national accounts]].\n\n=== Background ===\nAccumulation can be measured as the monetary value of investments, the amount of income that is reinvested, or as the change in the value of assets owned (the increase in the value of the capital stock). Using company [[balance sheet]]s, [[tax]] data and direct [[Statistical survey|surveys]] as a basis, government statisticians estimate total investments and assets for the purpose of [[national accounts]], national [[balance of payments]] and [[flow of funds]] statistics. The [[Federal Reserve|Reserve Banks]] and the [[Treasury]] usually provide interpretations and analysis of this data. Standard indicators include [[capital formation]], [[gross fixed capital formation]], [[fixed capital]], household asset wealth and [[foreign direct investment]].\n\nOrganisations such as the [[International Monetary Fund]], the UNCTAD, the [[World Bank Group]], the [[OECD]] and the [[Bank for International Settlements]] used national investment data to estimate world trends. The [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]], [[Eurostat]] and the Japan Statistical Office provide data on the United States, Europe and Japan respectively. Other useful sources of investment information are business magazines such as ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]], [[Forbes]], [[The Economist]], [[Business Week]]'' and so on as well as various corporate \"[[Watchdog journalism|watchdog]]\" organisations and [[non-governmental organisation]] publications. A reputable scientific journal is the ''Review of Income & Wealth''. In the case of the United States, the \"Analytical Perspectives\" document (an annex to the yearly budget) provides useful wealth and capital estimates applying to the whole country.\n\nIn [[Karl Marx]]' economic theory, capital accumulation refers to the operation whereby profits are reinvested increasing the total quantity of capital. Capital is viewed by Marx as expanding value, that is, in other terms, as a sum of capital, usually expressed in money, that is transformed through human labor into a larger value, extracted as profits and expressed as money. Here, capital is defined essentially as economic or commercial asset [[Value (economics)|value]] in search of additional value or [[surplus-value]]. This requires property relations which enable objects of value to be appropriated and owned, and trading rights to be established. Capital accumulation has a double origin, namely in trade and in [[Confiscation|expropriation]], both of a legal or illegal kind. The reason is that a stock of capital can be increased through a process of exchange or \"trading up\", but also through directly taking an asset or resource from someone else without compensation. [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] calls this [[accumulation by dispossession]].\n\nThe continuation and progress of capital accumulation depends on the removal of obstacles to the expansion of trade and this has historically often been a violent process. As markets expand, more and more new opportunities develop for accumulating capital because more and more types of goods and services can be traded in. However, capital accumulation may also confront resistance when people refuse to sell, or refuse to buy (for example a [[Strike action|strike]] by investors or workers, or [[consumer resistance]]).\n\n=== Concentration and centralisation ===\nAccording to Marx, capital has the tendency for concentration and centralization in the hands of the wealthy. Marx explains: \"It is concentration of capitals already formed, destruction of their individual independence, expropriation of capitalist by capitalist, transformation of many small into few large capitals. [...] Capital grows in one place to a huge mass in a single hand, because it has in another place been lost by many. [...] The battle of competition is fought by cheapening of commodities. The cheapness of commodities demands, ''caeteris paribus'', on the productiveness of labour, and this again on the scale of production. Therefore, the larger capitals beat the smaller. It will further be remembered that, with the development of the capitalist mode of production, there is an increase in the minimum amount of individual capital necessary to carry on a business under its normal conditions. The smaller capitals, therefore, crowd into spheres of production which Modern Industry has only sporadically or incompletely got hold of. Here competition rages [...] It always ends in the ruin of many small capitalists, whose capitals partly pass into the hands of their conquerors, partly vanish\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch25.htm|title=Economic Manuscripts: Capital Vol. I \u2013 Chapter Twenty-Five|first=Karl|last=Marx}}</ref>\n\n=== Rate of accumulation ===\nIn [[Marxian economics]], the rate of accumulation is defined as (1) the value of the real net increase in the [[stock and flow|stock]] of capital in an accounting period; and (2) the proportion of realised [[surplus-value]] or profit-income which is reinvested, rather than consumed. This rate can be expressed by means of various ratios between the original capital outlay, the realised turnover, surplus-value or profit and reinvestments (e.g. the writings of the economist [[Micha\u0142 Kalecki]]).\n\nOther things being equal, the greater the amount of profit-income that is disbursed as personal earnings and used for consumptive purposes, the lower the savings rate and the lower the rate of accumulation is likely to be. However, earnings spent on consumption can also stimulate market demand and higher investment. This is the cause of endless controversies in economic theory about \"how much to spend, and how much to save\".\n\nIn a boom period of capitalism, the growth of investments is cumulative, i.e. one investment leads to another, leading to a constantly expanding market, an expanding [[labor force]] and an increase in the standard of living for the majority of the people.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nIn a stagnating, decadent capitalism, the accumulation process is increasingly oriented towards investment on military and security forces, real estate, financial speculation and luxury consumption. In that case, income from [[value added|value-adding]] production will decline in favour of interest, rent and tax income, with as a corollary an increase in the level of permanent unemployment. The more capital one owns, the more capital one can also borrow. The inverse is also true and this is one factor in the widening gap between the rich and the poor.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n[[Ernest Mandel]] emphasised that the rhythm of capital accumulation and growth depended critically on (1) the division of a society's social product between \"[[necessary product]]\" and \"[[surplus product]]\"; and (2) the division of the surplus product between [[investment]] and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]. In turn, this allocation pattern reflected the outcome of [[competition]] among capitalists, competition between capitalists and workers and competition between workers. The pattern of capital accumulation can therefore never be simply explained by commercial factors as it also involved social factors and [[economic power|power]] relationships.\n\n=== Circuit of capital accumulation from production ===\nStrictly speaking, capital has accumulated only when realised [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] income has been reinvested in capital assets. As suggested in the first volume of Marx' ''[[Das Kapital]]'', the process of capital accumulation in production has at least seven distinct but linked moments:\n* The initial investment of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] (which could be borrowed capital) in [[means of production]] and [[labor power]].\n* The command over [[surplus-labour]] and its appropriation.\n* The [[valorisation]] (increase in value) of capital through production of new outputs.\n* The appropriation of the new output produced by employees, containing the added value.\n* The realisation of [[surplus-value]] through output sales.\n* The appropriation of realised surplus-value as (profit) income after deduction of costs.\n* The reinvestment of profit income in production.\n\nAll of these moments do not refer simply to an \"economic\" or commercial process. Rather, they assume the existence of legal, social, cultural and economic power conditions, without which creation, distribution and circulation of the new wealth could not occur. This becomes especially clear when the attempt is made to create a market where none exists, or where people refuse to trade.\n\n=== Simple and expanded reproduction ===\nIn the second volume of ''Das Kapital'', Marx continues the story and shows that with the aid of bank [[credit (finance)|credit]] capital in search of growth can more or less smoothly mutate from one form to another, alternately taking the form of money capital (liquid deposits, securities and so on), commodity capital (tradable products, real estate and the like), or production capital ([[means of production]] and labor power).\n\nHis discussion of the simple and expanded [[reproduction (economics)|reproduction]] of the conditions of production offers a more sophisticated model of the parameters of the accumulation process as a whole. At simple reproduction, a sufficient amount is produced to sustain society at the given [[living standard]]; the stock of capital stays constant. At expanded reproduction, more product-value is produced than is necessary to sustain society at a given living standard (a [[surplus product]]); the additional product-value is available for investments which enlarge the scale and variety of production.\n\nThe bourgeois claim there is no [[economic law]] according to which capital is necessarily re-invested in the expansion of production, that such depends on anticipated profitability, market expectations and perceptions of investment risk. Such statements only explain the subjective experiences of investors and ignore the objective realities which would influence such opinions. As Marx states in the second volume of ''Das Kapital'', simple reproduction only exists if the variable and surplus capital realised by Dept. 1\u2014producers of means of production\u2014exactly equals that of the constant capital of Dept. 2, producers of articles of consumption (p.&nbsp;524). Such equilibrium rests on various assumptions, such as a constant labor supply (no population growth). Accumulation does not imply a necessary change in total magnitude of value produced, but can simply refer to a change in the composition of an industry (p.&nbsp;514).\n\n[[Ernest Mandel]] introduced the additional concept of contracted economic reproduction, i.e. reduced accumulation where business operating at a loss outnumbers growing business, or economic reproduction on a decreasing scale, for example due to wars, natural disasters or de[[valorisation]].\n\nBalanced [[economic growth]] requires that different factors in the accumulation process expand in appropriate proportions. However, markets themselves cannot spontaneously create that balance and in fact what drives business activity is precisely the imbalances between [[supply and demand]]: inequality is the motor of growth. This partly explains why the worldwide pattern of economic growth is very uneven and unequal, even although markets have existed almost everywhere for a very long-time. Some people argue that it also explains government regulation of market trade and [[protectionism]].\n\n=== Capital accumulation as social relation ===\n\"Accumulation of capital\" sometimes also refers in Marxist writings to the reproduction of capitalist [[social relations]] (institutions) on a larger scale over time, i.e. the expansion of the size of the [[proletariat]] and of the wealth owned by the [[bourgeoisie]].\n\nThis interpretation emphasises that capital ownership, predicated on command over labor, is a social relation: the growth of capital implies the growth of the [[working class]] (a \"[[law of accumulation]]\"). In the first volume of ''Das Kapital'', Marx had illustrated this idea with reference to [[Edward Gibbon Wakefield]]'s theory of colonisation: {{Quotation|Wakefield discovered that in the Colonies, property in money, means of subsistence, machines, and other means of production, does not as yet stamp a man as a capitalist if there be wanting the correlative\u2014the wage-worker, the other man who is compelled to sell himself of his own free-will. He discovered that capital is not a thing, but a social relation between persons, established by the instrumentality of things. Mr. Peel, he moans, took with him from England to Swan River, West Australia, means of subsistence and of production to the amount of \u00a350,000. Mr. Peel had the foresight to bring with him, besides, 3,000 persons of the working-class, men, women, and children. Once arrived at his destination, 'Mr. Peel was left without a servant to make his bed or fetch him water from the river.' Unhappy Mr. Peel, who provided for everything except the export of English modes of production to Swan River!|''Das Kapital'', vol. 1, ch. 33}}\n\nIn the [[Capital, Volume III|third volume]] of ''Das Kapital'', Marx refers to the \"fetishism of capital\" reaching its highest point with interest-bearing capital because now capital seems to grow of its own accord without anybody doing anything: {{Quotation|The relations of capital assume their most externalised and most fetish-like form in interest-bearing capital. We have here <math>M - M'</math>, money creating more money, self-expanding value, without the process that effectuates these two extremes. In merchant's capital, <math>M - C - M'</math>, there is at least the general form of the capitalistic movement, although it confines itself solely to the sphere of circulation, so that profit appears merely as profit derived from alienation; but it is at least seen to be the product of a social relation, not the product of a mere thing. [...] This is obliterated in <math>M - M'</math>, the form of interest-bearing capital. [...] The thing (money, commodity, value) is now capital even as a mere thing, and capital appears as a mere thing. The result of the entire process of reproduction appears as a property inherent in the thing itself. It depends on the owner of the money, i.e., of the commodity in its continually exchangeable form, whether he wants to spend it as money or loan it out as capital. In interest-bearing capital, therefore, this automatic fetish, self-expanding value, money generating money, are brought out in their pure state and in this form it no longer bears the birth-marks of its origin. The [[Social relations|social relation]] is consummated in the relation of a thing, of money, to itself. Instead of the actual transformation of money into capital, we see here only form without content.|''Das Kapital'', vol. 1, ch. 24|source=}}\n\n== Wage labour ==\n{{Main|Wage labour}}\n[[File:Worker 9.JPG|thumb|An industrial [[worker]] amidst heavy steel [[semi-product]]s (Kinex Bearings, [[Byt\u010da]], [[Slovakia]], c. 1995\u20132000)]]\n[[Wage labour]] refers to the sale of [[Labour economics|labour]] under a formal or informal [[employment contract]] to an [[employer]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Steinfeld|2009|p=3}}: \"All labor contracts were/are designed legally to bind a worker in one way or another to fulfill the labor obligations the worker has undertaken.

Print.</ref>\n\nCritics of the capitalist mode of production see wage labour as a major, if not defining, aspect of hierarchical industrial systems. Most opponents of the institution support [[worker self-management]] and [[economic democracy]] as alternatives to both wage labour and to capitalism. While most opponents of the wage system<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> blame the capitalist owners of the means of production for its existence, most [[anarchists]] and other [[libertarian socialists]] also hold the state as equally responsible as it exists as a tool utilised by capitalists to subsidise themselves and protect the institution of [[privatism|private ownership of the means of production]]. As some opponents of wage labour take influence from Marxist propositions, many are opposed to [[private property]], but maintain respect for [[personal property]].\n\n=== Types ===\nThe most common form of wage labour currently is ordinary direct, or \"full-time\", employment in which a free worker sells his or her labour for an indeterminate time (from a few years to the entire career of the worker) in return for a money-wage or salary and a continuing relationship with the employer which it does not in general offer contractors or other irregular staff. However, wage labour takes many other forms and explicit as opposed to implicit (i.e. conditioned by local labour and tax law) contracts are not uncommon. Economic history shows a great variety of ways in which labour is traded and exchanged. The differences show up in the form of:\n* Employment status: a worker could be employed full-time, part-time, or on a casual basis. He or she could be employed for example temporarily for a specific project only, or on a permanent basis. Part-time wage labour could combine with part-time [[self-employment]]. The worker could be employed also as an [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]].\n* Civil (legal) status: the worker could for example be a free citizen, an [[indentured labour]]er, the subject of [[forced labour]] (including some prison or army labour); a worker could be assigned by the political authorities to a task, they could be a [[slavery|semi-slave]] or a [[serfdom|serf]] bound to the land who is hired out part of the time. So the labour might be performed on a more or less voluntary basis, or on a more or less involuntary basis, in which there are many gradations.\n* Method of payment (remuneration or [[Compensation of employees|compensation]]): the work done could be paid \"in cash\" (a money-wage) or \"in kind\" (through receiving goods and/or services), or in the form of \"[[Piecework|piece rates]]\" where the wage is directly dependent on how much the worker produces. In some cases, the worker might be paid in the form of credit used to buy goods and services, or in the form of [[Employee stock option|stock options]] or [[Share (finance)|shares]] in an enterprise.\n* Method of hiring: the worker might engage in a labour-contract on his or her own initiative, or he or she might hire out their labour as part of a group. However, he or she may also hire out their labour via an intermediary (such as an employment agency) to a third party. In this case, he or she is paid by the intermediary, but works for a third party which pays the intermediary. In some cases, labour is [[Subcontracting|subcontracted]] several times, with several intermediaries. Another possibility is that the worker is assigned or posted to a job by a political authority, or that an agency hires out a worker to an enterprise together with the [[means of production]].\n\n== Effects of war ==\n[[File:Alfred T. Palmer - Assembling the North American B-25 Mitchell at Kansas City, Kansas (USA).jpg|thumb|The common view among economic historians is that the [[Great Depression]] ended with the advent of World War II (assembling the North American [[B-25 Mitchell]] at [[Kansas City]], 1942)]]\nWar typically causes the diversion, destruction and creation of capital assets as capital assets are both destroyed or consumed and diverted to types of production needed to fight the war. Many assets are wasted and in some few cases created specifically to fight a war. War driven demands may be a powerful stimulus for the accumulation of capital and production capability in limited areas and market expansion outside the immediate theatre of war. Often this has induced laws against perceived and real [[war profiteering]].\n\nThe total hours worked in the United States rose by 34 percent during World War II, even though the military draft reduced the civilian labor force by 11 percent.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Ellen R. |last=Grattan |first2=Lee E. |last2=Ohanian |title=The macroeconomic effects of big fiscal shocks: the case of world war II |journal=Minneapolis Federal Reserve, Working Paper 599 |date=December 1999 |url=https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/wp/wp599.pdf }}</ref>\n\nWar destruction can be illustrated by looking at [[World War II]]. Industrial war damage was heaviest in Japan, where 1/4 of factory buildings and 1/3 of plant and equipment were destroyed; 1/7 of electric power-generating capacity was destroyed and 6/7 of oil refining capacity. The Japanese merchant fleet lost 80% of their ships. In Germany in 1944, when air attacks were heaviest, 6.5% of machine tools were damaged or destroyed, but around 90% were later repaired. About 10% of steel production capacity was lost. In Europe, the United States and the Soviet Union enormous resources were accumulated and ultimately dissipated as planes, ships, tanks and so on were built and then lost or destroyed.\n\nGermany's total war damage was estimated at about 17.5% of the pre-war total capital stock by value, i.e. about 1/6. In the [[Berlin]] area alone, there were 8 million refugees lacking basic necessities. In 1945, less than 10% of the railways were still operating. 2,395 rail bridges were destroyed and a total of 7,500 bridges, 10,000 locomotives and more than 100,000 goods wagons were destroyed. Less than 40% of the remaining locomotives were operational.\n\nHowever, by the first quarter of 1946 European rail traffic, which was given assistance and preferences (by Western appointed military governors) for resources and material as an essential asset, regained its prewar operational level. At the end of the year, 90% of Germany's railway lines were operating again. In retrospect, the rapidity of infrastructure reconstruction appears astonishing.\n\nInitially, in May 1945 newly installed United States president [[Harry S. Truman]]'s directive had been that no steps would be taken towards economic rehabilitation of Germany. In fact, the initial industry plan of 1946 prohibited production in excess of half of the 1938 level; the iron and steel industry was allowed to produce only less than a third of pre-war output. These plans were rapidly revised and better plans were instituted. In 1946, over 10% of Germany's physical capital stock (plant and equipment) was also dismantled and confiscated, most of it going to the Soviet Union. By 1947, industrial production in Germany was at 1/3 of the 1938 level and industrial investment at about 1/2 the 1938 level.\n\nThe first big strike-wave in the [[Ruhr]] occurred in early 1947\u2014it was about food rations and housing, but soon there were demands for nationalisation. However, the United States appointed military governor (Newman) stated at the time that he had the power to break strikes by withholding food rations. The clear message was \"no work, no eat\". As the military controls in Western Germany were nearly all relinquished and the Germans were allowed to rebuild their own economy with [[Marshall Plan]] aid things rapidly improved. By 1951, German industrial production had overtaken the prewar level. The Marshall Aid funds were important, but after the currency reform (which permitted German capitalists to revalue their assets) and the establishment of a new political system much more important was the commitment of the United States to rebuilding German capitalism and establishing a free market economy and government, rather than keeping Germany in a weak position. Initially, average [[real wages]] remained low, lower even than in 1938, until the early 1950s while profitability was unusually high. So the total investment fund, aided by credits, was also high, resulting in a high rate of capital accumulation which was nearly all reinvested in new construction or new tools.

For Marx, the capitalist stage of development or \"[[bourgeois]] society\" represented the most advanced form of social organization to date, but he also thought that the working classes would come to power in a worldwide [[socialism|socialist]] or [[communism|communist]] transformation of human society as the end of the series of first aristocratic, then capitalist and finally working class rule was reached.<ref>''[[The Communist Manifesto]]''</ref><ref>\"To Marx, the problem of reconstituting society did not arise from some prescription, motivated by his personal predilections; it followed, as an iron-clad historical necessity\u2014on the one hand, from the productive forces grown to powerful maturity; on the other, from the impossibility further to organize these forces according to the will of the [[law of value]].\" \u2014 [[Leon Trotsky]], \"Marxism in our Time\", 1939 (Inevitability of Socialism), [http://wsws.org/articles/2008/nov2008/time-n01.shtml WSWS.org]</ref>\n\nFollowing [[Adam Smith]], Marx distinguished the [[use value]] of commodities from their [[exchange value]] in the market. According to Marx, capital is created with the purchase of commodities for the purpose of creating new commodities with an exchange value higher than the sum of the original purchases. For Marx, the use of [[labor power]] had itself become a commodity under capitalism and the exchange value of labor power, as reflected in the wage, is less than the value it produces for the capitalist.\n\nThis difference in values, he argues, constitutes [[surplus value]], which the capitalists extract and accumulate. In his book ''[[Das Kapital|Capital]]'', Marx argues that the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] is distinguished by how the owners of capital extract this surplus from workers\u2014all prior class societies had extracted [[surplus labor]], but capitalism was new in doing so via the sale-value of produced commodities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1894-c3/ch47.htm|title=Capital.

However, other late Marxian thinkers argue that a social formation as a whole may be classed as capitalist if capitalism is the mode by which a surplus is extracted, even if this surplus is not produced by capitalist activity as when an absolute majority of the population is engaged in non-capitalist economic activity.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Ste.

If these conditions do not hold, then the [[Marshallian surplus|Marshallian]] model cannot be sustained. [[Piero Sraffa|Sraffa's]] critique focused on the inconsistency (except in implausible circumstances) of partial equilibrium analysis and the rationale for the upward slope of the supply curve in a market for a produced consumption good.<ref>Avi J. Cohen, \"'The Laws of Returns Under Competitive Conditions': Progress in Microeconomics Since Sraffa (1926)?\", ''Eastern Economic Journal'', {{abbr|vol.|volume}} 9, no. 3 (Jul.\u2013Sep.): 1983)</ref> The notability of Sraffa's critique is also demonstrated by [[Paul A. Samuelson]]'s comments and engagements with it over many years, for example:\n:What a cleaned-up version of Sraffa (1926) establishes is how nearly empty are all of Marshall's partial equilibrium boxes. To a logical purist of Wittgenstein and Sraffa class, the Marshallian partial equilibrium box of constant cost is even more empty than the box of increasing cost.<ref>Paul A. Samuelson, \"Reply\" in ''Critical Essays on Piero Sraffa's Legacy in Economics'' (edited by H.D. Kurz), Cambridge University Press, 2000</ref>\n\nAggregate excess demand in a market is the difference between the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied as a function of price. In the model with an upward-sloping supply curve and downward-sloping demand curve, the aggregate excess demand function only intersects the axis at one point, namely at the point where the supply and demand curves intersect. The [[Sonnenschein\u2013Mantel\u2013Debreu theorem]] shows that the standard model cannot be rigorously derived in general from [[general equilibrium theory]].<ref>Alan Kirman, \"The Intrinsic Limits of Modern Economic Theory: The Emperor has No Clothes\", ''The Economic Journal'', {{abbr|vol.|volume}} 99, no. 395, Supplement: Conference Papers (1989): pp. 126\u201339</ref>\n\nThe model of prices being determined by supply and demand assumes [[perfect competition]]. However, \"economists have no adequate model of how individuals and firms adjust prices in a competitive model.

This is not the case. Therefore, it is important not to put too much confidence in the apparent precision of supply and demand graphs. Supply and demand analysis is a useful precisely formulated conceptual tool that clever people have devised to help us gain an abstract understanding of a complex world.

[[Friedrich Hayek]] considered the phenomenon of [[self-organisation]] as underpinning capitalism.

Simple [[commodity]] exchange and consequently simple commodity production, which is the initial basis for the growth of capital from trade, have a very long history. [[Classical Islam|Arabs]] promulgated capitalist economic policies such as free trade and banking. Their use of [[Indo-Arabic numerals]] facilitated [[bookkeeping]].  These innovations migrated to Europe through trade partners in cities such as Venice and Pisa.  The Italian mathematician [[Fibonacci]] traveled the Mediterranean talking to Arab traders and returned to popularize the use of Indo-Arabic numerals in Europe.<ref name=\"Koehler, Benedikt\">Koehler, Benedikt. ''Early Islam and the Birth of Capitalism'',  \"In Baghdad, by the early tenth century a fully-fledged banking sector had come into being...\" p. 2, (Lexington Books, 2014).</ref>\n\nCapital and commercial trade thus existed for much of history, but it did not lead to industrialization or dominate the production process of society. That required a set of conditions, including specific technologies of mass production, the ability to independently and privately own and trade in means of production, a class of workers willing to sell their [[labor power]] for a living, a [[legal]] framework promoting commerce, a physical infrastructure allowing the circulation of goods on a large scale and security for private accumulation. Many of these conditions do not currently exist in many [[Third World]] countries, although there is plenty of capital and labor. The obstacles for the development of capitalist markets are therefore less technical and more social, cultural and political.\n\n=== Agrarianism ===\nThe economic foundations of the feudal agricultural system began to shift substantially in 16th-century England as the [[manorial system]] had broken down and land began to become concentrated in the hands of fewer landlords with increasingly large estates. Instead of a [[serf]]-based system of labor, workers were increasingly employed as part of a broader and expanding money-based economy. The system put pressure on both landlords and tenants to increase the productivity of agriculture to make profit; the weakened coercive power of the [[aristocracy]] to extract peasant [[Excess supply|surpluses]] encouraged them to try better methods, and the tenants also had incentive to improve their methods in order to flourish in a competitive [[labor economics|labor market]].

Moderate critics have recently challenged this, stating that the current influence lobbying groups have had on policy in the United States is a contradiction, given the approval of [[Citizens United (organization)|Citizens United]]. This has led people to question the idea that competitive capitalism promotes political freedom. The ruling on Citizens United allows corporations to spend undisclosed and unregulated amounts of money on political campaigns, shifting outcomes to the interests and undermining true democracy. As explained in [[Robin Hahnel]]\u2019s writings, the centerpiece of the ideological defense of the free market system is the concept of economic freedom and that supporters equate economic democracy with economic freedom and claim that only the free market system can provide economic freedom. According to Hahnel, there are a few objections to the premise that capitalism offers freedom through economic freedom. These objections are guided by critical questions about who or what decides whose freedoms are more protected. Often, the question of inequality is brought up when discussing how well capitalism promotes democracy. An argument that could stand is that economic growth can lead to inequality given that capital can be acquired at different rates by different people. In ''[[Capital in the Twenty-First Century]]'', [[Thomas Piketty]] of the [[Paris School of Economics]] asserts that inequality is the inevitable consequence of economic growth in a capitalist economy and the resulting [[Wealth concentration|concentration of wealth]] can destabilize democratic societies and undermine the ideals of social justice upon which they are built.<ref>[[Thomas Piketty|Piketty, Thomas]] (2014).

In [[State capitalism|state capitalist]] systems, markets are relied upon the least, with the state relying heavily on [[state-owned enterprises]] or indirect economic planning to accumulate capital.\n\nSupply is the amount of a good or service that is available for purchase or sale. Demand is the measure of value for a good that people are willing to buy at a given time. Prices tend to rise when demand for an available resource increases or its supply diminishes and fall with demand or when supply increases.{{According to whom|date=March 2020}}{{Fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nCompetition arises when more than one producer is trying to sell the same or similar products to the same buyers. Adherents of the capitalist theory believe that competition leads to innovation and more affordable prices. [[Monopoly|Monopolies]] or [[cartels]] can develop, especially if there is no competition. A monopoly occurs when a firm is granted exclusivity over a market. Hence, the firm can engage in [[rent seeking]] behaviors such as limiting output and raising prices because it has no fear of competition. A cartel is a group of firms that act together in a monopolistic manner to control output and prices.\n\nGovernments have implemented legislation for the purpose of preventing the creation of monopolies and cartels. In 1890, the Sherman Antitrust Act became the first legislation passed by the United States Congress to limit monopolies.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monopoly.asp|title=Monopoly|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=24 November 2003|work=Investopedia|access-date=2 March 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Profit motive ===\n{{Main|Profit motive}}\nThe [[profit motive]], in the theory in capitalism, is the desire to earn income in the form of profit. Stated differently, the reason for a business's existence is to turn a profit. The profit motive functions according to [[rational choice theory]], or the theory that individuals tend to pursue what is in their own best interests. Accordingly, businesses seek to benefit themselves and/or their shareholders by maximizing profit.\n\nIn capitalist theoretics, the profit motive is said to ensure that resources are being allocated efficiently. For instance, [[Austrian economist]] [[Henry Hazlitt]] explains: \"If there is no profit in making an article, it is a sign that the labor and capital devoted to its production are misdirected: the value of the resources that must be used up in making the article is greater than the value of the article itself\".<ref>Hazlitt, Henry. \"The Function of Profits\". ''Economics in One Lesson''. Ludwig Von Mises Institute. Web. 22 April 2013.</ref> In other words, profits let companies know whether an item is worth producing. Theoretically{{according to whom|date=March 2020}}, in free and competitive markets maximising profit ensures that resources are not wasted.\n\n=== Private property ===\n{{Main|Private property}}\nThe relationship between the [[state (polity)|state]], its formal mechanisms and capitalist societies has been debated in many fields of social and political theory, with active discussion since the 19th century. [[Hernando de Soto (economist)|Hernando de Soto]] is a contemporary Peruvian economist who has argued that an important characteristic of capitalism is the functioning state protection of property rights in a formal property system where ownership and transactions are clearly recorded.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2001/03/desoto.htm |title=The mystery of capital|author=Hernando de Soto|accessdate=26 February 2008}}</ref>\n\nAccording to de Soto, this is the process by which physical assets are transformed into capital, which in turn may be used in many more ways and much more efficiently in the market economy. A number of Marxian economists have argued that the [[Enclosure Acts]] in England and similar legislation elsewhere were an integral part of capitalist [[primitive accumulation]] and that specific legal frameworks of private land ownership have been integral to the development of capitalism.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch27.htm |title=Capital, v. 1.

Private money-making in various forms (renting, banking, merchant trade, production for profit and so on) preceded the development of the capitalist mode of production as such. The capitalist mode of production proper based on wage-labour and private ownership of the means of production and on industrial technology began to grow rapidly in Western Europe from the [[Industrial Revolution]], later extending to most of the world.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe term capitalist mode of production is defined by [[Private property|private ownership]] of the [[means of production]], extraction of [[surplus value]] by the owning class for the purpose of [[capital accumulation]], [[Wage labour|wage-based labour]] and at least as far as [[Commodity|commodities]] are concerned being [[Market economy|market-based]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/c/a.htm#capitalism | title=Capitalism. | publisher=marxists.org | accessdate=8 July 2011 | author=Encyclopedia of Marxism at marxism.org}}</ref>\n\nCapitalism in the form of money-making activity has existed in the shape of merchants and money-lenders who acted as intermediaries between consumers and producers engaging in [[simple commodity production]] (hence the reference to \"[[merchant capitalism]]\") since the beginnings of civilisation. What is specific about the \"capitalist mode of production\" is that most of the inputs and outputs of production are supplied through the market (i.e. they are commodities) and essentially all production is in this mode.<ref name=\"Modern Economics 1986, p. 54\" /> For example, in flourishing feudalism most or all of the factors of production including labour are owned by the feudal ruling class outright and the products may also be consumed without a market of any kind, it is production for use within the feudal social unit and for limited trade.<ref name=ch32/> This has the important consequence that the whole organisation of the production process is reshaped and re-organised to conform with economic [[bounded rationality|rationality as bounded]] by capitalism, which is expressed in price relationships between inputs and outputs (wages, non-labour factor costs, sales and profits) rather than the larger rational context faced by society overall\u2014that is, the whole process is organised and re-shaped in order to conform to \"commercial logic\".

It posulates that in a [[perfect competition|perfectly competitive market]], the [[unit price]] for a particular [[Good (economics)|good]] will vary until it settles at a point where the quantity demanded by consumers (at the current price) will equal the quantity supplied by producers (at the current price), resulting in an [[economic equilibrium]] for price and [[Output (economics)|quantity]].\n\nThe four basic \"laws\" of [[Supply (economics)|supply]] and [[demand]], as described by [[David Besanko]] and [[Ronald Braeutigam]], are:<ref name=\"besanko-and-braeutigam-2010\">{{Cite book | last = Besanko | first = David | last2 = Braeutigam | first2 = Ronald | year = 2010 | title = Microeconomics | publisher = Wiley | edition = 4th }}</ref>{{rp|37}}\n# If demand increases (demand curve shifts to the right) and supply remains unchanged, then a shortage occurs, leading to a higher equilibrium price.\n# If demand decreases (demand curve shifts to the left) and supply remains unchanged, then a surplus occurs, leading to a lower equilibrium price.\n# If demand remains unchanged and supply increases (supply curve shifts to the right), then a surplus occurs, leading to a lower equilibrium price.\n# If demand remains unchanged and supply decreases (supply curve shifts to the left), then a shortage occurs, leading to a higher equilibrium price.\n\n=== Graphical representation of supply and demand ===\nAlthough it is normal to regard the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied as [[function (mathematics)|functions]] of the price of the goods, the standard graphical representation, usually attributed to [[Alfred Marshall]], has price on the vertical axis and quantity on the horizontal axis, the opposite of the standard convention for the representation of a mathematical function.\n\nSince determinants of supply and demand other than the price of the goods in question are not explicitly represented in the supply-demand diagram, changes in the values of these variables are represented by moving the supply and demand curves (often described as \"shifts\" in the curves). By contrast, responses to changes in the price of the good are represented as movements along unchanged supply and demand curves.\n\n==== Supply schedule ====\nA supply schedule is a table that shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied. Under the assumption of [[perfect competition]], supply is determined by [[marginal cost]]. That is: firms will produce additional output while the cost of producing an extra unit of output is less than the price they would receive.\n\nA hike in the cost of raw goods would decrease supply and shifting costs up while a discount would increase supply, shifting costs down and hurting producers as producer surplus decreases.\n\nBy its very nature, conceptualising a supply curve requires the firm to be a perfect competitor (i.e. to have no influence over the market price). This is true because each point on the supply curve is the answer to the question \"If this firm is ''faced with'' this potential price, how much output will it be able to and willing to sell?\". If a firm has market power, its decision of how much output to provide to the market influences the market price, therefore the firm is not \"faced with\" any price and the question becomes less relevant.\n\nEconomists distinguish between the supply curve of an individual firm and the market supply curve. The market supply curve is obtained by summing the quantities supplied by all suppliers at each potential price, thus in the graph of the supply curve individual firms' supply curves are added horizontally to obtain the market supply curve.\n\nEconomists also distinguish the short-run market supply curve from the long-run market supply curve. In this context, two things are assumed constant by definition of the short run: the availability of one or more fixed inputs (typically [[physical capital]]) and the number of firms in the industry. In the long-run, firms can adjust their holdings of physical capital, enabling them to better adjust their quantity supplied at any given price. Furthermore, in the long-run potential competitors can [[Market entry strategy|enter]] or exit the industry in response to market conditions. For both of these reasons, long-run market supply curves are generally flatter than their short-run counterparts.\n\nThe determinants of supply are:\n# Production costs: how much a goods costs to be produced. Production costs are the cost of the inputs; primarily labor, capital, energy and materials. They depend on the technology used in production and/or technological advances. See [[productivity]].\n# Firms' expectations about future prices.\n# Number of suppliers.\n\n==== Demand schedule ====\nA demand schedule, depicted graphically as the [[demand curve]], represents the amount of some [[Good (economics)|goods]] that buyers are willing and able to purchase at various prices, assuming all determinants of demand other than the price of the good in question, such as income, tastes and preferences, the price of [[substitute good]]s and the price of [[complementary good]]s, remain the same. According to the [[law of demand]], the demand curve is almost always represented as downward-sloping, meaning that as price decreases, consumers will buy more of the good.<ref name=\"axes\">Note that unlike most [[Graph of a function|graphs]], supply & demand curves are plotted with the independent variable (price) on the vertical axis and the dependent variable (quantity supplied or demanded) on the horizontal axis.</ref>\n\nJust like the supply curves reflect [[marginal cost]] curves, demand curves are determined by [[marginal utility]] curves.<ref>{{cite web|title=Marginal Utility and Demand|url=http://www.amosweb.com/cgi-bin/awb_nav.pl?s=wpd&c=dsp&k=marginal+utility+and+demand|accessdate=9 February 2007}}</ref> Consumers will be willing to buy a given quantity of a good at a given price, if the marginal utility of additional consumption is equal to the [[opportunity cost]] determined by the price\u2014that is, the marginal utility of alternative consumption choices. The demand schedule is defined as the willingness and ability of a consumer to purchase a given product in a given frame of time.\n\nWhile the aforementioned demand curve is generally downward-sloping, there may be rare examples of goods that have upward-sloping demand curves. Two different hypothetical types of goods with upward-sloping demand curves are [[Giffen good]]s (an inferior, but [[Staple food|staple]] good) and [[Veblen good]]s (goods made more fashionable by a higher price).\n\nBy its very nature, conceptualising a demand curve requires that the purchaser be a perfect competitor\u2014that is, that the purchaser has no influence over the market price. This is true because each point on the demand curve is the answer to the question \"If this buyer is faced with this potential price, how much of the product will it purchase?\". If a buyer has market power, so its decision of how much to buy influences the market price, then the buyer is not \"faced with\" any price and the question is meaningless.\n\nLike with supply curves, economists distinguish between the demand curve of an individual and the market demand curve. The market demand curve is obtained by summing the quantities demanded by all consumers at each potential price, thus in the graph of the demand curve individuals' demand curves are added horizontally to obtain the market demand curve.\n\nThe determinants of demand are:\n# Income.\n# Tastes and preferences.\n# Prices of related goods and services.\n# Consumers' expectations about future prices and incomes that can be checked.\n# Number of potential consumers.\n\n=== Equilibrium ===\n{{Further|Economic equilibrium}}\nIn the context of supply and demand, economic equilibrium refers to a state where economic forces such as [[supply and demand]] are balanced and in the absence of external influences the ([[:wikt:equilibrium|equilibrium]]) values of economic variables will not change. For example, in the standard text-book model of [[perfect competition]] equilibrium occurs at the point at which quantity demanded and quantity supplied are equal.<ref>{{cite book |authorlink=Hal Varian |first=Hal R. |last=Varian |title=Microeconomic Analysis |edition=Third |publisher=Norton |location=New York |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-393-95735-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/microeconomicana00vari_0 }}</ref> Market equilibrium in this case refers to a condition where a market price is established through competition such that the amount of goods or services sought by [[Law of supply and demand|buyers]] is equal to the amount of goods or services produced by [[Law of supply and demand|sellers]]. This price is often called the competitive price or [[market clearing]] price and will tend not to change unless demand or supply changes and the quantity is called \"competitive quantity\" or market clearing quantity.\n\n=== Partial equilibrium ===\n{{Main|Partial equilibrium}}\nPartial equilibrium, as the name suggests, takes into consideration only a part of the market to attain equilibrium.\n\nJain proposes (attributed to [[George Stigler]]): \"A partial equilibrium is one which is based on only a restricted range of data, a standard example is price of a single product, the prices of all other products being held fixed during the analysis\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Jain|first=T.R.|title=Microeconomics and Basic Mathematics|year=2006|publisher=VK Publications|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-81-87140-89-4|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fUUoFwco2Z8C}}</ref>\n\nThe supply and demand model is a partial equilibrium model of [[economic equilibrium]], where the clearance on the [[Market (economics)|market]] of some specific [[good (economics)|goods]] is obtained independently from prices and quantities in other markets. In other words, the prices of all [[substitute good|substitutes]] and [[complement good|complements]] as well as [[income]] levels of [[consumer]]s are constant. This makes analysis much simpler than in a [[general equilibrium]] model which includes an entire economy.\n\nHere the dynamic process is that prices adjust until supply equals demand. It is a powerfully simple technique that allows one to study [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]], [[Pareto Efficiency|efficiency]] and [[comparative statics]]. The stringency of the simplifying assumptions inherent in this approach make the model considerably more tractable, but it may produce results which while seemingly precise do not effectively model real world economic phenomena.\n\nPartial equilibrium analysis examines the effects of policy action in creating equilibrium only in that particular sector or market which is directly affected, ignoring its effect in any other market or industry assuming that they being small will have little impact if any.\n\nHence this analysis is considered to be useful in constricted markets.\n\n[[L\u00e9on Walras]] first formalised the idea of a one-period economic equilibrium of the general economic system, but it was French economist [[Antoine Augustin Cournot]] and English political economist [[Alfred Marshall]] who developed tractable models to analyse an economic system.\n\n=== Empirical estimation ===\nDemand and supply relations in a market can be statistically estimated from price, quantity and other [[data]] with sufficient information in the model. This can be done with [[System of linear equations|simultaneous-equation]] methods of estimation in [[econometrics]]. Such methods allow solving for the model-relevant \"structural coefficients\", the estimated algebraic counterparts of the theory. The [[Identification (parameter)|parameter identification problem]] is a common issue in \"structural estimation\". Typically, data on [[exogenous variable]]s (that is, variables other than price and quantity, both of which are [[endogenous variable]]s) are needed to perform such an estimation. An alternative to \"structural estimation\" is [[Reduced form|reduced-form]] estimation, which regresses each of the endogenous variables on the respective exogenous variables.\n\n=== Macroeconomic uses of demand and supply ===\nDemand and supply have also been generalised to explain [[macroeconomic]] variables in a [[market economy]], including the [[Real GDP|quantity of total output]] and the general [[price level]]. The [[AD-AS model|Aggregate Demand\u2013Aggregate Supply model]] may be the most direct application of supply and demand to macroeconomics, but other macroeconomic models also use supply and demand. Compared to [[microeconomic]] uses of demand and supply, different (and more controversial) theoretical considerations apply to such [[macroeconomic]] counterparts as [[aggregate demand]] and [[aggregate supply]]. Demand and supply are also used in macroeconomic theory to relate [[money supply]] and money demand to [[interest rate]]s and to relate labor supply and labor demand to wage rates.\n\n=== History ===\nAccording to Hamid S. Hosseini, the \"power of supply and demand\" was discussed to some extent by several early Muslim scholars, such as fourteenth-century [[Mamluk]] scholar [[Ibn Taymiyyah]], who wrote: \"If desire for goods increases while its availability decreases, its price rises. On the other hand, if availability of the good increases and the desire for it decreases, the price comes down\".<ref name=Hosseini>{{cite book |title=A Companion to the History of Economic Thought |chapter=Contributions of Medieval Muslim Scholars to the History of Economics and their Impact: A Refutation of the Schumpeterian Great Gap |last=Hosseini |first=Hamid S. |editor=Biddle, Jeff E. |editor2=Davis, Jon B. |editor3=Samuels, Warren J. |year=2003 |publisher=Blackwell |location=Malden, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-631-22573-7 |doi=10.1002/9780470999059.ch3 |pages=28\u201345 [28 & 38]}} (citing Hamid S.

In this description, demand is [[Economic rent|rent]]: \"The price of any commodity rises or falls by the proportion of the number of buyer and sellers\" and \"that which regulates the price... [of goods] is nothing else but their quantity in proportion to their rent\".\n\nThe phrase \"supply and demand\" was first used by [[James Denham-Steuart]] in his ''Inquiry into the Principles of Political Economy'', published in 1767. [[Adam Smith]] used the phrase in his 1776 book ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', and [[David Ricardo]] titled one chapter of his 1817 work ''[[Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]]'' \"On the Influence of Demand and Supply on Price\".<ref name=Humphrey>Thomas M.

In ''Principles of Political Economy and Taxation'', Ricardo more rigorously laid down the idea of the assumptions that were used to build his ideas of supply and demand. [[Antoine Augustin Cournot]] first developed a mathematical model of supply and demand in his 1838 ''Researches into the Mathematical Principles of Wealth'', including diagrams.\n\nDuring the late 19th century, the marginalist school of thought emerged. This field mainly was started by [[William Stanley Jevons|Stanley Jevons]], [[Carl Menger]] and [[L\u00e9on Walras]]. The key idea was that the price was set by the most expensive price\u2014that is, the price at the margin. This was a substantial change from Adam Smith's thoughts on determining the supply price.\n\nIn his 1870 essay \"On the Graphical Representation of Supply and Demand\", [[Fleeming Jenkin]] in the course of \"introduc[ing] the diagrammatic method into the English economic literature\" published the first drawing of supply and demand curves therein,<ref>A.D.

In most cases, the government does not prevent firms from determining what wages they will pay and what prices they will charge for their products. However, many countries have [[minimum wage]] laws and minimum safety standards.\n\nUnder some versions of capitalism, the government carries out a number of economic functions, such as issuing money, supervising public utilities, and enforcing private contracts. Many countries have [[competition law]]s that prohibit monopolies and cartels. Despite anti-monopoly laws, large corporations can form near-monopolies in some industries. Such firms can temporarily drop prices and accept losses to prevent competition from entering the market and then raise them again once the threat of competition is reduced. In many countries, public utilities such as electricity, heating fuel and communications are able to operate as a monopoly under government regulation due to high economies of scale.\n\nGovernment agencies regulate the standards of service in many industries, such as airlines and broadcasting, as well as financing a wide range of programs. In addition, the government regulates the flow of capital and uses financial tools such as the interest rate to control such factors as inflation and unemployment.<ref>\"Capitalism.\" World Book Encyclopedia. 1988. p. 194.</ref>\n\n=== Relationship to political freedom ===\nIn his book ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', [[Friedrich Hayek]] asserts that the free market understanding of [[economic freedom]] as present in capitalism is a requisite of [[political freedom]]. He argues that the market mechanism is the only way of deciding what to produce and how to distribute the items without using coercion. [[Milton Friedman]], [[Andrew Brennan (economist)|Andrew Brennan]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] also promoted this view. Friedman claimed that centralized economic operations are always accompanied by [[political repression]]. In his view, transactions in a market economy are voluntary and that the wide diversity that voluntary activity permits is a fundamental threat to repressive political leaders and greatly diminishes their power to coerce. Some of Friedman's views were shared by [[John Maynard Keynes]], who believed that capitalism is vital for freedom to survive and thrive.<ref>{{cite book |author=Friedrich Hayek|title=The Road to Serfdom|journal=Nature|volume=154|issue=3911|pages=473\u201374|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|year=1944|isbn=978-0-226-32061-8|bibcode=1944Natur.154..473C|doi=10.1038/154473a0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Bellamy, Richard|title=The Cambridge History of Twentieth-Century Political Thought|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-521-56354-3|page=60}}</ref> [[Freedom House]], an American think tank that conducts international research on, and advocates for, democracy, political freedom and human rights, has argued \"there is a high and statistically significant correlation between the level of political freedom [[Freedom in the World|as measured by Freedom House]] and economic freedom [[Index of Economic Freedom|as measured by the Wall Street Journal/Heritage Foundation survey]]\".<ref>Adrian Karatnycky.

They vary in their institutional makeup and by their economic policies. The common features among all the different forms of capitalism is that they are based on the production of goods and services for profit, predominantly market-based allocation of resources and they are structured upon the accumulation of capital. They include advanced capitalism, corporate capitalism, finance capitalism, free-market capitalism, mercantilism, social capitalism, state capitalism and welfare capitalism. Other variants of capitalism include [[anarcho-capitalism]], [[community capitalism]], [[humanistic capitalism]], [[neo-capitalism]], [[state monopoly capitalism]], [[Supercapitalism (modern)|supercapitalism]] and [[technocapitalism]].\n\n=== Advanced ===\n{{Main|Advanced capitalism}}\nAdvanced capitalism is the situation that pertains to a society in which the [[capitalist model]] has been integrated and developed deeply and extensively for a prolonged period. Various writers identify [[Antonio Gramsci]] as an influential early theorist of advanced capitalism, even if he did not use the term himself. In his writings, Gramsci sought to explain how capitalism had adapted to avoid the revolutionary overthrow that had seemed inevitable in the 19th century. At the heart of his explanation was the decline of raw coercion as a tool of class power, replaced by use of [[civil society]] institutions to manipulate public ideology in the capitalists' favour.<ref>Lears, T.J.

Habermas observed four general features that characterise advanced capitalism:\n# Concentration of industrial activity in a few large firms.\n# Constant reliance on the state to stabilise the economic system.\n# A formally democratic government that legitimises the activities of the state and dissipates opposition to the system.\n# The use of nominal wage increases to pacify the most restless segments of the work force.<ref>Habermas, 1988: 37, 75.</ref>\n\n=== Corporate ===\n{{Main|Corporate capitalism}}\n{{See also|Crony capitalism|State monopoly capitalism}}\nCorporate capitalism is a free or mixed-market capitalist economy characterized by the dominance of hierarchical, bureaucratic corporations.\n\n=== Finance ===\n{{Main|Finance capitalism}}\n{{See also|Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)}}\nFinance capitalism is the subordination of processes of [[Production (economics)|production]] to the accumulation of [[money]] profits in a [[financial system]].

It typically entails support for highly [[Competition (economics)|competitive markets]] and [[private ownership]] of the [[means of production]]. ''Laissez-faire'' capitalism is a more extensive form of this free-market economy, but one in which the role of the state is limited to protecting [[Property rights (economics)|property rights]]. In [[Anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalist]] theory, property rights are protected by private firms and market-generated law. According to anarcho-capitalists, this entails property rights without statutory law through market-generated tort, contract and property law as well as the self-sustaining private industry.\n\n=== Mercantile ===\n{{Main|Mercantilism}}\n{{See also|Protectionism}}\n[[File:Lloyds Subscription Room edited.jpg|thumb|The subscription room at [[Lloyd's of London]] in the early 19th century]]\nMercantilism is a nationalist form of early capitalism that came into existence approximately in the late 16th century. It is characterized by the intertwining of national business interests to state-interest and imperialism; and consequently, the state apparatus is utilized to advance national business interests abroad. An example of this is colonists living in America who were only allowed to trade with and purchase goods from their respective mother countries (e.g. Britain, France and Portugal). Mercantilism was driven by the belief that the wealth of a nation is increased through a positive balance of trade with other nations\u2014it corresponds to the phase of capitalist development sometimes called the [[primitive accumulation of capital]].\n\n=== Social ===\n{{Main|Social market economy}}\n{{See also|Nordic model}}\nA social market economy is a free-market or mixed-market capitalist system, sometimes classified as a [[coordinated market economy]], where government intervention in price formation is kept to a minimum, but the state provides significant services in the area of social security, unemployment benefits and recognition of [[labor rights]] through national [[collective bargaining]] arrangements. This model is prominent in Western and Northern European countries as well as Japan, albeit in slightly different configurations. The vast majority of enterprises are privately owned in this economic model.\n\n[[Rhine capitalism]] is the contemporary model of capitalism and adaptation of the social market model that exists in continental Western Europe today.\n\n=== State ===\n{{Main|State capitalism}}\nState capitalism is a capitalist market economy dominated by state-owned enterprises, where the state enterprises are organized as commercial, profit-seeking businesses. The designation has been used broadly throughout the 20th century to designate a number of different economic forms, ranging from state-ownership in market economies to the command economies of the former [[Eastern Bloc]]. According to Aldo Musacchio, a professor at Harvard Business School, state capitalism is a system in which governments, whether democratic or autocratic, exercise a widespread influence on the economy either through direct ownership or various subsidies. Musacchio notes a number of differences between today's state capitalism and its predecessors. In his opinion, gone are the days when governments appointed bureaucrats to run companies: the world's largest state-owned enterprises are now traded on the public markets and kept in good health by large institutional investors. Contemporary state capitalism is associated with the [[East Asian model of capitalism]], [[dirigisme]] and the economy of Norway.<ref>{{cite news |last=Musacchio |first=Aldo |url=http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/802 |title=Economist Debates: State capitalism: Statements |work=The Economist}}</ref> Alternatively, [[Merriam-Webster]] defines state capitalism as \"an economic system in which private capitalism is modified by a varying degree of government ownership and control\".<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/state%20capitalism State capitalism].

Today, welfare capitalism is most often associated with the models of capitalism found in Central Mainland and Northern Europe such as the [[Nordic model]], [[social market economy]] and [[Rhine capitalism]]. In some cases, welfare capitalism exists within a mixed economy, but welfare states can and do exist independently of policies common to mixed economies such as [[state interventionism]] and extensive regulation.\n\nA mixed economy is a largely market-based capitalist economy consisting of both private and public ownership of the means of production and [[economic interventionism]] through macroeconomic policies intended to correct [[market failure]]s, reduce unemployment and keep inflation low. The degree of intervention in markets varies among different countries. Some mixed economies such as France under [[dirigisme]] also featured a degree of [[Indicative planning|indirect economic planning]] over a largely capitalist-based economy.\n\nMost modern capitalist economies are defined as mixed economies to some degree.\n\n== Capital accumulation ==\n{{Main|Capital accumulation}}\n{{Further|Money}}\nThe [[accumulation of capital]] is the process of \"making money\", or growing an initial sum of money through investment in production. Capitalism is based on the accumulation of capital, whereby [[financial capital]] is invested in order to make a profit and then reinvested into further production in a continuous process of accumulation. In Marxian economic theory, this dynamic is called the [[law of value]]. Capital accumulation forms the basis of capitalism, where economic activity is structured around the accumulation of [[Capital (economics)|capital]], defined as investment in order to realize a financial profit.<ref name=\"Economist definition\">{{cite news | title = Economics A\u2013Z: ''Capital'' | url = http://www.economist.com/economics-a-to-z/c#node-21529870 | website = [[economist.com|The Economist]] | accessdate = 25 March 2015 }}</ref> In this context, \"capital\" is defined as money or a financial asset invested for the purpose of making more money (whether in the form of profit, rent, interest, royalties, capital gain or some other kind of return).<ref name=\"MIA definition\">{{cite web | title = Encyclopedia of Marxism \u2013 Glossary of terms: ''Capital'' | url = http://marxists.org/glossary/terms/c/a.htm#capital | website = [[Marxists Internet Archive]] | accessdate = 25 March 2015 }}</ref>\n\nIn mainstream [[economics]], [[accounting]] and [[Marxian economics]], capital accumulation is often equated with [[investment (macroeconomics)|investment]] of profit income or saving, especially in [[real vs. nominal in economics|real]] capital goods. The concentration and centralisation of capital are two of the results of such accumulation. In modern [[macroeconomics]] and [[econometrics]], the phrase \"[[capital formation]]\" is often used in preference to \"accumulation\", though the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) refers nowadays to \"accumulation\". The term \u201caccumulation\u201d is occasionally used in [[national accounts]].\n\n=== Background ===\nAccumulation can be measured as the monetary value of investments, the amount of income that is reinvested, or as the change in the value of assets owned (the increase in the value of the capital stock). Using company [[balance sheet]]s, [[tax]] data and direct [[Statistical survey|surveys]] as a basis, government statisticians estimate total investments and assets for the purpose of [[national accounts]], national [[balance of payments]] and [[flow of funds]] statistics. The [[Federal Reserve|Reserve Banks]] and the [[Treasury]] usually provide interpretations and analysis of this data. Standard indicators include [[capital formation]], [[gross fixed capital formation]], [[fixed capital]], household asset wealth and [[foreign direct investment]].\n\nOrganisations such as the [[International Monetary Fund]], the UNCTAD, the [[World Bank Group]], the [[OECD]] and the [[Bank for International Settlements]] used national investment data to estimate world trends. The [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]], [[Eurostat]] and the Japan Statistical Office provide data on the United States, Europe and Japan respectively. Other useful sources of investment information are business magazines such as ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]], [[Forbes]], [[The Economist]], [[Business Week]]'' and so on as well as various corporate \"[[Watchdog journalism|watchdog]]\" organisations and [[non-governmental organisation]] publications. A reputable scientific journal is the ''Review of Income & Wealth''. In the case of the United States, the \"Analytical Perspectives\" document (an annex to the yearly budget) provides useful wealth and capital estimates applying to the whole country.\n\nIn [[Karl Marx]]' economic theory, capital accumulation refers to the operation whereby profits are reinvested increasing the total quantity of capital. Capital is viewed by Marx as expanding value, that is, in other terms, as a sum of capital, usually expressed in money, that is transformed through human labor into a larger value, extracted as profits and expressed as money. Here, capital is defined essentially as economic or commercial asset [[Value (economics)|value]] in search of additional value or [[surplus-value]]. This requires property relations which enable objects of value to be appropriated and owned, and trading rights to be established. Capital accumulation has a double origin, namely in trade and in [[Confiscation|expropriation]], both of a legal or illegal kind. The reason is that a stock of capital can be increased through a process of exchange or \"trading up\", but also through directly taking an asset or resource from someone else without compensation. [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] calls this [[accumulation by dispossession]].\n\nThe continuation and progress of capital accumulation depends on the removal of obstacles to the expansion of trade and this has historically often been a violent process. As markets expand, more and more new opportunities develop for accumulating capital because more and more types of goods and services can be traded in. However, capital accumulation may also confront resistance when people refuse to sell, or refuse to buy (for example a [[Strike action|strike]] by investors or workers, or [[consumer resistance]]).\n\n=== Concentration and centralisation ===\nAccording to Marx, capital has the tendency for concentration and centralization in the hands of the wealthy. Marx explains: \"It is concentration of capitals already formed, destruction of their individual independence, expropriation of capitalist by capitalist, transformation of many small into few large capitals. [...] Capital grows in one place to a huge mass in a single hand, because it has in another place been lost by many. [...] The battle of competition is fought by cheapening of commodities. The cheapness of commodities demands, ''caeteris paribus'', on the productiveness of labour, and this again on the scale of production. Therefore, the larger capitals beat the smaller. It will further be remembered that, with the development of the capitalist mode of production, there is an increase in the minimum amount of individual capital necessary to carry on a business under its normal conditions. The smaller capitals, therefore, crowd into spheres of production which Modern Industry has only sporadically or incompletely got hold of. Here competition rages [...] It always ends in the ruin of many small capitalists, whose capitals partly pass into the hands of their conquerors, partly vanish\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch25.htm|title=Economic Manuscripts: Capital Vol. I \u2013 Chapter Twenty-Five|first=Karl|last=Marx}}</ref>\n\n=== Rate of accumulation ===\nIn [[Marxian economics]], the rate of accumulation is defined as (1) the value of the real net increase in the [[stock and flow|stock]] of capital in an accounting period; and (2) the proportion of realised [[surplus-value]] or profit-income which is reinvested, rather than consumed. This rate can be expressed by means of various ratios between the original capital outlay, the realised turnover, surplus-value or profit and reinvestments (e.g. the writings of the economist [[Micha\u0142 Kalecki]]).\n\nOther things being equal, the greater the amount of profit-income that is disbursed as personal earnings and used for consumptive purposes, the lower the savings rate and the lower the rate of accumulation is likely to be. However, earnings spent on consumption can also stimulate market demand and higher investment. This is the cause of endless controversies in economic theory about \"how much to spend, and how much to save\".\n\nIn a boom period of capitalism, the growth of investments is cumulative, i.e. one investment leads to another, leading to a constantly expanding market, an expanding [[labor force]] and an increase in the standard of living for the majority of the people.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nIn a stagnating, decadent capitalism, the accumulation process is increasingly oriented towards investment on military and security forces, real estate, financial speculation and luxury consumption. In that case, income from [[value added|value-adding]] production will decline in favour of interest, rent and tax income, with as a corollary an increase in the level of permanent unemployment. The more capital one owns, the more capital one can also borrow. The inverse is also true and this is one factor in the widening gap between the rich and the poor.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n[[Ernest Mandel]] emphasised that the rhythm of capital accumulation and growth depended critically on (1) the division of a society's social product between \"[[necessary product]]\" and \"[[surplus product]]\"; and (2) the division of the surplus product between [[investment]] and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]. In turn, this allocation pattern reflected the outcome of [[competition]] among capitalists, competition between capitalists and workers and competition between workers. The pattern of capital accumulation can therefore never be simply explained by commercial factors as it also involved social factors and [[economic power|power]] relationships.\n\n=== Circuit of capital accumulation from production ===\nStrictly speaking, capital has accumulated only when realised [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] income has been reinvested in capital assets. As suggested in the first volume of Marx' ''[[Das Kapital]]'', the process of capital accumulation in production has at least seven distinct but linked moments:\n* The initial investment of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] (which could be borrowed capital) in [[means of production]] and [[labor power]].\n* The command over [[surplus-labour]] and its appropriation.\n* The [[valorisation]] (increase in value) of capital through production of new outputs.\n* The appropriation of the new output produced by employees, containing the added value.\n* The realisation of [[surplus-value]] through output sales.\n* The appropriation of realised surplus-value as (profit) income after deduction of costs.\n* The reinvestment of profit income in production.\n\nAll of these moments do not refer simply to an \"economic\" or commercial process. Rather, they assume the existence of legal, social, cultural and economic power conditions, without which creation, distribution and circulation of the new wealth could not occur. This becomes especially clear when the attempt is made to create a market where none exists, or where people refuse to trade.\n\n=== Simple and expanded reproduction ===\nIn the second volume of ''Das Kapital'', Marx continues the story and shows that with the aid of bank [[credit (finance)|credit]] capital in search of growth can more or less smoothly mutate from one form to another, alternately taking the form of money capital (liquid deposits, securities and so on), commodity capital (tradable products, real estate and the like), or production capital ([[means of production]] and labor power).\n\nHis discussion of the simple and expanded [[reproduction (economics)|reproduction]] of the conditions of production offers a more sophisticated model of the parameters of the accumulation process as a whole. At simple reproduction, a sufficient amount is produced to sustain society at the given [[living standard]]; the stock of capital stays constant. At expanded reproduction, more product-value is produced than is necessary to sustain society at a given living standard (a [[surplus product]]); the additional product-value is available for investments which enlarge the scale and variety of production.\n\nThe bourgeois claim there is no [[economic law]] according to which capital is necessarily re-invested in the expansion of production, that such depends on anticipated profitability, market expectations and perceptions of investment risk. Such statements only explain the subjective experiences of investors and ignore the objective realities which would influence such opinions. As Marx states in the second volume of ''Das Kapital'', simple reproduction only exists if the variable and surplus capital realised by Dept. 1\u2014producers of means of production\u2014exactly equals that of the constant capital of Dept. 2, producers of articles of consumption (p.&nbsp;524). Such equilibrium rests on various assumptions, such as a constant labor supply (no population growth). Accumulation does not imply a necessary change in total magnitude of value produced, but can simply refer to a change in the composition of an industry (p.&nbsp;514).\n\n[[Ernest Mandel]] introduced the additional concept of contracted economic reproduction, i.e. reduced accumulation where business operating at a loss outnumbers growing business, or economic reproduction on a decreasing scale, for example due to wars, natural disasters or de[[valorisation]].\n\nBalanced [[economic growth]] requires that different factors in the accumulation process expand in appropriate proportions. However, markets themselves cannot spontaneously create that balance and in fact what drives business activity is precisely the imbalances between [[supply and demand]]: inequality is the motor of growth. This partly explains why the worldwide pattern of economic growth is very uneven and unequal, even although markets have existed almost everywhere for a very long-time. Some people argue that it also explains government regulation of market trade and [[protectionism]].\n\n=== Capital accumulation as social relation ===\n\"Accumulation of capital\" sometimes also refers in Marxist writings to the reproduction of capitalist [[social relations]] (institutions) on a larger scale over time, i.e. the expansion of the size of the [[proletariat]] and of the wealth owned by the [[bourgeoisie]].\n\nThis interpretation emphasises that capital ownership, predicated on command over labor, is a social relation: the growth of capital implies the growth of the [[working class]] (a \"[[law of accumulation]]\"). In the first volume of ''Das Kapital'', Marx had illustrated this idea with reference to [[Edward Gibbon Wakefield]]'s theory of colonisation: {{Quotation|Wakefield discovered that in the Colonies, property in money, means of subsistence, machines, and other means of production, does not as yet stamp a man as a capitalist if there be wanting the correlative\u2014the wage-worker, the other man who is compelled to sell himself of his own free-will. He discovered that capital is not a thing, but a social relation between persons, established by the instrumentality of things. Mr. Peel, he moans, took with him from England to Swan River, West Australia, means of subsistence and of production to the amount of \u00a350,000. Mr. Peel had the foresight to bring with him, besides, 3,000 persons of the working-class, men, women, and children. Once arrived at his destination, 'Mr. Peel was left without a servant to make his bed or fetch him water from the river.' Unhappy Mr. Peel, who provided for everything except the export of English modes of production to Swan River!|''Das Kapital'', vol. 1, ch. 33}}\n\nIn the [[Capital, Volume III|third volume]] of ''Das Kapital'', Marx refers to the \"fetishism of capital\" reaching its highest point with interest-bearing capital because now capital seems to grow of its own accord without anybody doing anything: {{Quotation|The relations of capital assume their most externalised and most fetish-like form in interest-bearing capital. We have here <math>M - M'</math>, money creating more money, self-expanding value, without the process that effectuates these two extremes. In merchant's capital, <math>M - C - M'</math>, there is at least the general form of the capitalistic movement, although it confines itself solely to the sphere of circulation, so that profit appears merely as profit derived from alienation; but it is at least seen to be the product of a social relation, not the product of a mere thing. [...] This is obliterated in <math>M - M'</math>, the form of interest-bearing capital. [...] The thing (money, commodity, value) is now capital even as a mere thing, and capital appears as a mere thing. The result of the entire process of reproduction appears as a property inherent in the thing itself. It depends on the owner of the money, i.e., of the commodity in its continually exchangeable form, whether he wants to spend it as money or loan it out as capital. In interest-bearing capital, therefore, this automatic fetish, self-expanding value, money generating money, are brought out in their pure state and in this form it no longer bears the birth-marks of its origin. The [[Social relations|social relation]] is consummated in the relation of a thing, of money, to itself.

While most opponents of the wage system<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> blame the capitalist owners of the means of production for its existence, most [[anarchists]] and other [[libertarian socialists]] also hold the state as equally responsible as it exists as a tool utilised by capitalists to subsidise themselves and protect the institution of [[privatism|private ownership of the means of production]]. As some opponents of wage labour take influence from Marxist propositions, many are opposed to [[private property]], but maintain respect for [[personal property]].\n\n=== Types ===\nThe most common form of wage labour currently is ordinary direct, or \"full-time\", employment in which a free worker sells his or her labour for an indeterminate time (from a few years to the entire career of the worker) in return for a money-wage or salary and a continuing relationship with the employer which it does not in general offer contractors or other irregular staff. However, wage labour takes many other forms and explicit as opposed to implicit (i.e. conditioned by local labour and tax law) contracts are not uncommon. Economic history shows a great variety of ways in which labour is traded and exchanged. The differences show up in the form of:\n* Employment status: a worker could be employed full-time, part-time, or on a casual basis. He or she could be employed for example temporarily for a specific project only, or on a permanent basis. Part-time wage labour could combine with part-time [[self-employment]]. The worker could be employed also as an [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]].\n* Civil (legal) status: the worker could for example be a free citizen, an [[indentured labour]]er, the subject of [[forced labour]] (including some prison or army labour); a worker could be assigned by the political authorities to a task, they could be a [[slavery|semi-slave]] or a [[serfdom|serf]] bound to the land who is hired out part of the time. So the labour might be performed on a more or less voluntary basis, or on a more or less involuntary basis, in which there are many gradations.\n* Method of payment (remuneration or [[Compensation of employees|compensation]]): the work done could be paid \"in cash\" (a money-wage) or \"in kind\" (through receiving goods and/or services), or in the form of \"[[Piecework|piece rates]]\" where the wage is directly dependent on how much the worker produces. In some cases, the worker might be paid in the form of credit used to buy goods and services, or in the form of [[Employee stock option|stock options]] or [[Share (finance)|shares]] in an enterprise.\n* Method of hiring: the worker might engage in a labour-contract on his or her own initiative, or he or she might hire out their labour as part of a group. However, he or she may also hire out their labour via an intermediary (such as an employment agency) to a third party. In this case, he or she is paid by the intermediary, but works for a third party which pays the intermediary. In some cases, labour is [[Subcontracting|subcontracted]] several times, with several intermediaries. Another possibility is that the worker is assigned or posted to a job by a political authority, or that an agency hires out a worker to an enterprise together with the [[means of production]].\n\n== Effects of war ==\n[[File:Alfred T. Palmer - Assembling the North American B-25 Mitchell at Kansas City, Kansas (USA).jpg|thumb|The common view among economic historians is that the [[Great Depression]] ended with the advent of World War II (assembling the North American [[B-25 Mitchell]] at [[Kansas City]], 1942)]]\nWar typically causes the diversion, destruction and creation of capital assets as capital assets are both destroyed or consumed and diverted to types of production needed to fight the war. Many assets are wasted and in some few cases created specifically to fight a war. War driven demands may be a powerful stimulus for the accumulation of capital and production capability in limited areas and market expansion outside the immediate theatre of war. Often this has induced laws against perceived and real [[war profiteering]].\n\nThe total hours worked in the United States rose by 34 percent during World War II, even though the military draft reduced the civilian labor force by 11 percent.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Ellen R. |last=Grattan |first2=Lee E. |last2=Ohanian |title=The macroeconomic effects of big fiscal shocks: the case of world war II |journal=Minneapolis Federal Reserve, Working Paper 599 |date=December 1999 |url=https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/wp/wp599.pdf }}</ref>\n\nWar destruction can be illustrated by looking at [[World War II]]. Industrial war damage was heaviest in Japan, where 1/4 of factory buildings and 1/3 of plant and equipment were destroyed; 1/7 of electric power-generating capacity was destroyed and 6/7 of oil refining capacity. The Japanese merchant fleet lost 80% of their ships. In Germany in 1944, when air attacks were heaviest, 6.5% of machine tools were damaged or destroyed, but around 90% were later repaired. About 10% of steel production capacity was lost. In Europe, the United States and the Soviet Union enormous resources were accumulated and ultimately dissipated as planes, ships, tanks and so on were built and then lost or destroyed.\n\nGermany's total war damage was estimated at about 17.5% of the pre-war total capital stock by value, i.e. about 1/6. In the [[Berlin]] area alone, there were 8 million refugees lacking basic necessities. In 1945, less than 10% of the railways were still operating. 2,395 rail bridges were destroyed and a total of 7,500 bridges, 10,000 locomotives and more than 100,000 goods wagons were destroyed. Less than 40% of the remaining locomotives were operational.\n\nHowever, by the first quarter of 1946 European rail traffic, which was given assistance and preferences (by Western appointed military governors) for resources and material as an essential asset, regained its prewar operational level. At the end of the year, 90% of Germany's railway lines were operating again. In retrospect, the rapidity of infrastructure reconstruction appears astonishing.\n\nInitially, in May 1945 newly installed United States president [[Harry S. Truman]]'s directive had been that no steps would be taken towards economic rehabilitation of Germany. In fact, the initial industry plan of 1946 prohibited production in excess of half of the 1938 level; the iron and steel industry was allowed to produce only less than a third of pre-war output. These plans were rapidly revised and better plans were instituted. In 1946, over 10% of Germany's physical capital stock (plant and equipment) was also dismantled and confiscated, most of it going to the Soviet Union. By 1947, industrial production in Germany was at 1/3 of the 1938 level and industrial investment at about 1/2 the 1938 level.\n\nThe first big strike-wave in the [[Ruhr]] occurred in early 1947\u2014it was about food rations and housing, but soon there were demands for nationalisation. However, the United States appointed military governor (Newman) stated at the time that he had the power to break strikes by withholding food rations. The clear message was \"no work, no eat\". As the military controls in Western Germany were nearly all relinquished and the Germans were allowed to rebuild their own economy with [[Marshall Plan]] aid things rapidly improved. By 1951, German industrial production had overtaken the prewar level. The Marshall Aid funds were important, but after the currency reform (which permitted German capitalists to revalue their assets) and the establishment of a new political system much more important was the commitment of the United States to rebuilding German capitalism and establishing a free market economy and government, rather than keeping Germany in a weak position. Initially, average [[real wages]] remained low, lower even than in 1938, until the early 1950s while profitability was unusually high. So the total investment fund, aided by credits, was also high, resulting in a high rate of capital accumulation which was nearly all reinvested in new construction or new tools. This was called the [[German economic miracle]] or ''Wirtschaftswunder''.<ref>Armstrong, Glyn & Harrison, ''Capitalism since world war 2''. Fontana, 1984.

However, damage to [[human capital]] has been much more devastating in terms of fatalities (in the case of World War II, about 55 million deaths), permanent physical disability, enduring ethnic hostility and psychological injuries which have effects for at least several generations.\n\n== Criticism ==\n{{Main|Criticism of capitalism}}\n[[File:Anti-capitalism color\u2014 Restored.png|thumb|The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] poster \"[[Pyramid of Capitalist System]]\" (1911)]]\nCritics of capitalism associate the economic system with [[social inequality]]; unfair [[distribution of wealth]] and power; [[Economic materialism|materialism]]; repression of workers and [[trade union]]ists; [[social alienation]]; [[economic inequality]]; [[unemployment]]; and economic instability. Many socialists consider capitalism to be irrational in that production and the direction of the economy are unplanned, creating many inconsistencies and internal contradictions.<ref>Brander, James A.

For Marx, the capitalist stage of development or \"[[bourgeois]] society\" represented the most advanced form of social organization to date, but he also thought that the working classes would come to power in a worldwide [[socialism|socialist]] or [[communism|communist]] transformation of human society as the end of the series of first aristocratic, then capitalist and finally working class rule was reached.<ref>''[[The Communist Manifesto]]''</ref><ref>\"To Marx, the problem of reconstituting society did not arise from some prescription, motivated by his personal predilections; it followed, as an iron-clad historical necessity\u2014on the one hand, from the productive forces grown to powerful maturity; on the other, from the impossibility further to organize these forces according to the will of the [[law of value]].\" \u2014 [[Leon Trotsky]], \"Marxism in our Time\", 1939 (Inevitability of Socialism), [http://wsws.org/articles/2008/nov2008/time-n01.shtml WSWS.org]</ref>\n\nFollowing [[Adam Smith]], Marx distinguished the [[use value]] of commodities from their [[exchange value]] in the market. According to Marx, capital is created with the purchase of commodities for the purpose of creating new commodities with an exchange value higher than the sum of the original purchases. For Marx, the use of [[labor power]] had itself become a commodity under capitalism and the exchange value of labor power, as reflected in the wage, is less than the value it produces for the capitalist.\n\nThis difference in values, he argues, constitutes [[surplus value]], which the capitalists extract and accumulate. In his book ''[[Das Kapital|Capital]]'', Marx argues that the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] is distinguished by how the owners of capital extract this surplus from workers\u2014all prior class societies had extracted [[surplus labor]], but capitalism was new in doing so via the sale-value of produced commodities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1894-c3/ch47.htm|title=Capital.

If these conditions do not hold, then the [[Marshallian surplus|Marshallian]] model cannot be sustained. [[Piero Sraffa|Sraffa's]] critique focused on the inconsistency (except in implausible circumstances) of partial equilibrium analysis and the rationale for the upward slope of the supply curve in a market for a produced consumption good.<ref>Avi J.

Samuelson]]'s comments and engagements with it over many years, for example:\n:What a cleaned-up version of Sraffa (1926) establishes is how nearly empty are all of Marshall's partial equilibrium boxes. To a logical purist of Wittgenstein and Sraffa class, the Marshallian partial equilibrium box of constant cost is even more empty than the box of increasing cost.<ref>Paul A.

Kurz), Cambridge University Press, 2000</ref>\n\nAggregate excess demand in a market is the difference between the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied as a function of price. In the model with an upward-sloping supply curve and downward-sloping demand curve, the aggregate excess demand function only intersects the axis at one point, namely at the point where the supply and demand curves intersect. The [[Sonnenschein\u2013Mantel\u2013Debreu theorem]] shows that the standard model cannot be rigorously derived in general from [[general equilibrium theory]].<ref>Alan Kirman, \"The Intrinsic Limits of Modern Economic Theory: The Emperor has No Clothes\", ''The Economic Journal'', {{abbr|vol.|volume}} 99, no. 395, Supplement: Conference Papers (1989): pp. 126\u201339</ref>\n\nThe model of prices being determined by supply and demand assumes [[perfect competition]].

Its closest relatives were the also-extinct [[Rodrigues starling]] and [[Mauritius starling]] from nearby islands, and the three apparently originated in south-east Asia. The bird was first mentioned during the 17th century and was long thought to be related to the [[hoopoe]], from which its name is derived. Some affinities have been proposed, but it was confirmed as a starling in a [[DNA]] study.\n\nThe hoopoe starling was {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length. Its [[plumage]] was primarily white and grey, with its back, wings and tail a darker brown and grey. It had a light, mobile [[Crest (feathers)|crest]], which curled forwards. The bird is thought to have been [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]], with males larger and having more curved beaks. The juveniles were more brown than the adults. Little is known about hoopoe starling behaviour. Reportedly living in large flocks, it inhabited humid areas and marshes. The hoopoe starling was [[omnivorous]], feeding on plant matter and insects. Its pelvis was robust, its feet and claws large, and its jaws strong, indicating that it foraged near the ground.\n\nThe birds were hunted by settlers on R\u00e9union, who also [[aviculture|kept them as pets]]. Nineteen specimens exist in museums around the world. The hoopoe starling was reported to be in decline by the early 19th century and was probably extinct before the 1860s. Several factors have been proposed, including competition and predation by introduced species, disease, deforestation, and persecution by humans, who hunted it for food and as an alleged crop pest.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:Hoopoe Starling.jpg|upright|left|thumb|alt=Painting of grey-and-white bird with tufted head and curved beak|1770s [[type illustration]] by [[Fran\u00e7ois-Nicolas Martinet]]]]\nThe first account thought to mention the hoopoe starling is a 1658 list of birds of [[Madagascar]] written by French governor [[\u00c9tienne de Flacourt]]. He mentioned a black-and-grey \"tivouch\" or [[hoopoe]]; later authors have wondered whether this referred to the hoopoe starling or the Madagascan subspecies of hoopoe (''Upupa epops marginata''), which resembles the Eurasian subspecies. The hoopoe starling was first noted on the [[Mascarene island]] of [[R\u00e9union]] (then called \"Bourbon\") by P\u00e8re Vachet in 1669, and described in detail by French traveller [[Sieur Dubois]]'s in 1674:<ref name=\"Hume 2014 8\u201314\">Hume, J. P. (2014). pp. 8\u201314.</ref>\n{{Quotation|Hoopoes or 'Calandres', having a white tuft on the head, the rest of the plumage white and grey, the bill and the feet like a bird of prey; they are a little larger than the young pigeons.

Little was recorded about the hoopoe starling during the next 100&nbsp;years, but specimens began to be brought to Europe during the 18th century. The species was first scientifically described by [[Philippe Gu\u00e9neau de Montbeillard]] in the 1779 edition of [[Comte de Buffon]]'s ''[[Histoire Naturelle]]'', and received its [[scientific name]] from Dutch naturalist [[Pieter Boddaert]] for the book's 1783 edition. Boddaert named the bird ''Upupa varia''; its genus name is that of the hoopoe, and its specific name means \"variegated\", describing its black-and-white colour.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 8\u201314\"/>\n\nBoddaert provided [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnean]] [[binomial nomenclature|binomial]] names for plates in Buffon's works, so the accompanying 1770s plate of the hoopoe starling by French engraver [[Fran\u00e7ois-Nicolas Martinet]] is considered the [[holotype]] or type illustration. Though the plate may have been based on a specimen in the [[National Museum of Natural History in Paris]], this is impossible to determine today; the Paris museum originally had five hoopoe starling skins, some which only arrived during the 19th century. The possibly female specimen MNHN 2000-756, one of the most-illustrated skins, has an artificially trimmed crest resulting in an unnaturally semi-circular shape, unlike its appearance in life; the type illustration has a similarly shaped crest.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 8\u201314\"/>\n[[File:Fregilupus varius - John Gerrard Keulemans improved.jpg|upright|thumb|left|alt=Painting of brown-and-white bird on a branch, with a shorter head tuft|1907 illustration by [[John Gerrard Keulemans]], based on a specimen in Paris with a trimmed crest]]\nDe Flacourt's \"tivouch\" led early writers to believe that variants of the bird were found on Madagascar and the [[Cape of Africa]]; they were thought to be hoopoes of the genus ''Upupa'', which received names such as ''Upupa capensis'' and ''Upupa madagascariensis''. Some authors also allied the bird with groups such as [[birds-of-paradise]], [[bee-eater]]s, [[cowbird]]s, [[Icteridae]], and [[chough]]s, resulting in its reassignment to other genera with new names, such as ''Coracia cristata'' and ''Pastor upupa''. In 1831, French naturalist [[Ren\u00e9-Primev\u00e8re Lesson]] placed the bird in its own [[monotypic]] genus, ''Fregilipus'', a composite of ''Upupa'' and ''Fregilus'', the latter a defunct genus name of the chough. French naturalist [[Auguste Vinson]] established in 1868 that the bird was restricted to the island of R\u00e9union and proposed a new binomial, ''Fregilupus borbonicus'', referring to the former name of the island.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 29\u201344\">Hume, J. P. (2014). pp. 29\u201344.</ref>\n\nGerman ornithologist [[Hermann Schlegel]] first proposed in 1857 that the species belonged to the [[starling]] family, (Sturnidae), reclassifying it as part of the genus ''[[Sturnus]]'', ''S. capensis''. This reclassification was observed by other authors; Swedish zoologist [[Carl Jakob Sundevall]] proposed the new genus name ''Lophopsarus'' (\"crested starling\") in 1872, yet ''Fregilupus varius''\u2014the oldest name\u2014remains the bird's binomial, and all other scientific names are synonyms.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 8\u201314\"/> In 1874, after a detailed analysis of the only known skeleton (held at the [[Cambridge University Museum of Zoology]]), British ornithologist James Murie agreed that it was a starling.<ref name=\"Murie\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1096-3642.1874.tb02508.x| title = On the Skeleton and Lineage of ''Fregilupus varius''| journal = Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London| url= https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/28502639#page/622/mode/1up| volume = 42| pages = 474\u2013488| year = 1874| last1 = Murie | first1 = D.

Only three specimens were sexed (all males), with age and individual variation not considered. The male is thought to have been largest with a longer, curvier beak. In 1911, R\u00e9union resident Eug\u00e8ne Jacob de Cordemoy recalled his observations of the bird about 50&nbsp;years before, suggesting that only males had a white crest, but this is thought to be incorrect. A presumed female (MNHN 2000-756) in the Paris museum appears to have a smaller crest, a smaller and less-curved beak, and smaller primary coverts. A juvenile specimen (MHNT O2650) has a smaller crest and primary coverts, with a brown wash instead of ash grey on the crest, lore, and superciliary stripe, and a light-brown (instead of ash-brown) back. The juveniles of some southeast Asian starlings are also browner than adults.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 29\u201344\"/>\n\nVinson, who observed live hoopoe starlings when he lived on R\u00e9union, described the crest as flexible, disunited and forward-curled barbs of various lengths, highest in the centre, and able to be erected at will. He compared the bird's crest to that of a [[cockatoo]] and to the tail feathers of a [[bird-of-paradise]]. Most mounted specimens have an erect crest, indicating its natural position. The only illustration of the hoopoe starling now thought to have been made from life was drawn by French artist Paul Philippe Sauguin de Jossigny during the early 1770s. Jossigny instructed engravers under the drawing that for accuracy, they should depict the crest angled forward from the head (not straight up). Hume believes that Martinet did this when he made the type illustration, and it was derivative of Jossigny's image rather than a life drawing. Jossigny also made the only known life drawing of the now-extinct [[Newton's parakeet]] (''Psittacula exsul'') after a specimen sent to him from Rodrigues to Mauritius, so this is perhaps also where he drew the hoopoe starling. Murie suggested that only the illustrations by Martinet and [[Jacques Barraband]] were \"original\", since he was unaware of Jossigny's drawing, but noted a crudeness and stiffness in them which made neither appear lifelike.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 29\u201344\"/><ref name=\"Murie\"/>\n\n==Behaviour and ecology==\n[[File:Bourbon Crested Starling.jpg|upright|thumb|left|alt=Painting of brown-and-white, crested bird with a long beak, on a branch under an overhanging rock|1910 illustration by Eduard de Maes]]\nLittle is known about the behaviour of the hoopoe starling. According to [[Fran\u00e7ois Levaillant]]'s 1807 account of the bird (which included observations from a R\u00e9union resident) it was abundant, with large flocks inhabiting humid areas and marshes. In 1831, Lesson, without explanation, described its habits as similar to those of a [[crow]]. Its song was described as a \"bright and cheerful whistle\" and \"clear notes\", indicating a similarity to the songs of other starlings.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 29\u201344\"/> Vinson's 1877 account relates his experiences with the bird more than 50&nbsp;years earlier:\n{{Quotation|Now these daughters of the wood, when they were numerous, flew in flocks and went thus in the rain forests, while deviating little from one another, as good companions or as nymphs taking a bath: they lived on berries, seeds and insects, and the cr\u00e9oles, disgusted by the latter fact, held them for an impure game. Sometimes, coming from the woods to the littoral [coast], always flying and leaping from tree to tree, branch to branch, they often alighted in swarms on coffee trees in bloom, and there was in the past the testimony of an inhabitant of the Island of Bourbon, said the naturalist Levaillant, that they caused big damage in coffee trees by making the flowers fall prematurely. But it is not the white flowers of coffee that the hoopoes were searching for and thus behaving so, it was for the caterpillars and insects that devoured them; and in this they made an important service to the silviculture of the Island of Bourbon and the rich coffee plantations, with which this land was then covered, the golden age of the country!<ref name=\"Hume 2014 29\u201344\"/>}}\n[[File:Hoopoe starling skeletal elements.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Drawing of separate bird bones|1874 lithograph of skeletal elements by Berjeau]]\nLike most other starlings, the hoopoe starling was [[omnivorous]], feeding on fruits, seeds, and insects. Its tongue\u2014long, slender, sharp, and frayed\u2014may have been able to move rapidly, helpful when feeding on fruit, nectar, pollen, and invertebrates. Its pelvic elements were robust and its feet and claws large, indicating that it foraged near the ground. Its jaws were strong; Morioka compared its skull to that of the hoopoe, and it may have foraged in a similar way, probing and opening holes in substrate by inserting and opening its beak.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 29\u201344\"/>\n\nDe Montbeillard was informed of the stomach contents of a dissected specimen, consisting of seeds and the berries of \"''Pseudobuxus''\" (possibly ''[[Eugenia buxifolia]]'', a bush with sweet, orange berries). He noted that the bird weighed {{convert|4|oz|g}}, and was fatter around June and July. Several accounts suggest that the hoopoe starling migrated on R\u00e9union, spending six months in the lowlands and six months in the mountains. Food may have been easier to obtain in the lowlands during winter, with the birds breeding in the mountain forests during summer. The hoopoe starling probably nested in tree cavities.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 29\u201344\"/>\n\nMany other endemic species on R\u00e9union became extinct after the arrival of humans and the resulting disruption of the island's [[ecosystem]]. The Hoopoe starling lived with other now-extinct birds, such as the [[R\u00e9union ibis]], the [[Mascarene parrot]], the [[R\u00e9union parakeet]], the [[R\u00e9union swamphen]], the [[R\u00e9union owl]], the [[R\u00e9union night heron]], and the [[R\u00e9union pink pigeon]]. Extinct R\u00e9union reptiles include the [[R\u00e9union giant tortoise]] and an undescribed ''[[Leiolopisma]]'' [[skink]].

These birds allow themselves to be approached very closely, so the cats take them without leaving their places.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 29\u201344\"/>}}\n\nThe hoopoe starling was [[aviculture|kept as a pet]] on R\u00e9union and Mauritius, and although the bird was becoming scarcer, some specimens were obtained during the early 19th century. It is unknown whether any live specimens were ever transported from the Mascarenes. Cordemoy recalled that captive birds could be fed a wide variety of food, such as bananas, potatoes, and [[chayote]], and wild birds would never enter inhabited areas. Many individuals survived on Mauritius after escaping there, and it was thought that a feral population could be established. The Mauritian population lasted less than a decade; the final specimen on the island (the last definite record of a live specimen anywhere) was taken in 1836. Specimens could still be collected on R\u00e9union during the 1830s and, possibly, the early 1840s.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 29\u201344\"/>\n\nThere are nineteen surviving hoopoe starling specimens in museums around the world (including one skeleton and two specimens preserved in spirit), with two in the Paris museum and four in [[Troyes]]. Additional skins in Turin, Livorno, and Caen were destroyed during [[World War II]], and four skins have disappeared from R\u00e9union and Mauritius (which now have one each). Specimens were sent to Europe beginning in the second half of the 18th century, with most collected during the first half of the 19th century. It is unclear when each specimen was acquired, and specimens were frequently moved between collections. It is also unclear which specimens were the basis for which descriptions and illustrations.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 29\u201344\"/> The only known subfossil hoopoe starling specimen is a femur, discovered in 1993 in a R\u00e9union [[grotto]].<ref name=\"Avifauna\">{{Cite journal\n| last1 = Mourer-Chauvire\n| first1 = C.\n| last2 = Bour\n| first2 = R.\n| last3 = Ribes\n| first3 = S.\n| last4 = Moutou\n| first4 = F.\n| title = Avian paleontology at the close of the 20th century: The avifauna of R\u00e9union Island (Mascarene Islands) at the time of the arrival of the first Europeans\n| journal = [[Smithsonian Contributions to Paleobiology]]\n| volume = 89\n| pages = 8\u201311\n| date =\n| year = 1999\n| hdl = 10088/2005\n}}</ref>\n\n===Extinction===\n[[File:Hoopoe starling Roussin.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Painting of bright-eyed hoopoe starling on a tree branch|1860s illustration by Albert Roussin]]\nSeveral causes for the decline and sudden disappearance of the hoopoe starling have been proposed, all connected to the activities of humans on R\u00e9union, who it survived alongside for two centuries. An oft-repeated suggestion is that the introduction of the [[common myna]] (''Acridotheres tristis'') led to competition between these two starling species. The myna was introduced to R\u00e9union in 1759 to combat locusts, and became a pest itself, but the hoopoe starling coexisted with the myna for nearly 100&nbsp;years and they may not have shared habitat. The [[black rat]] (''Rattus rattus'') arrived on Reunion in the 1670s, and the [[brown rat]] (''Rattus norvegicus'') in 1735, multiplying rapidly and threatening agriculture and native species. Like the hoopoe starling, the rats inhabited tree cavities and would have preyed on eggs, juveniles, and nesting birds. During the mid-19th century the [[R\u00e9union slit-eared skink]] (''Gongylomorphus borbonicus'') became extinct due to predation by the introduced [[wolf snake]] (''Lycodon aulicum''), which may have deprived the bird of a significant food source.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 29\u201344\"/> Hoopoe starlings may have contracted diseases from introduced birds, a factor known to have triggered declines and extinctions in endemic Hawaiian birds. According to British ecologist Anthony S. Cheke, this was the chief cause of the hoopoe starling's extinction; the species had survived for generations despite other threats.<ref name=\"Cheke87\">{{Cite book| last1 = Cheke | first1 = A.

Former slaves joined white peasants in cultivating pristine areas after slavery was abolished in 1848, and the hoopoe starling was pushed to the edges of its former habitat. According to Hume, over-hunting was the final blow to the species; with forests more accessible, hunting by the rapidly growing human population may have driven the remaining birds to extinction. In 1821, a law mandating the extermination of grain-damaging birds was implemented, and the hoopoe starling had a reputation for damaging crops. During the 1860s, various writers noted that the bird had almost disappeared, but it was probably already extinct by this time; in 1877, Vinson lamented that the last individuals might have been killed by recent forest fires. No attempts to preserve the species in captivity seem to have been made.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 29\u201344\"/><ref name=Vinson-1877>{{cite journal |last1=Vinson |first1=A. |title=Faune d\u00e9truite.

The Rodrigues and Mauritius species probably disappeared with the arrival of rats; at least five species of ''[[Aplonis]]'' starlings have disappeared from the [[Pacific Islands]], with rats contributing to their extinction.

Its closest relatives were the also extinct [[Rodrigues starling]] and [[Mauritius starling]] from nearby islands, and the three apparently originated in south-east Asia. The bird was first mentioned during the 17th century and was long thought to be related to the [[hoopoe]], from which its name is derived. Some affinities have been proposed, but it was confirmed as a starling in a [[DNA]] study.\n\nThe hoopoe starling was {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length. Its [[plumage]] was primarily white and grey, with its back, wings and tail a darker brown and grey. It had a light, mobile [[Crest (feathers)|crest]], which curled forwards. The bird is thought to have been [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]], with males larger and having more curved beaks. The juveniles were more brown than the adults. Little is known about hoopoe starling behaviour. Reportedly living in large flocks, it inhabited humid areas and marshes. The hoopoe starling was [[omnivorous]], feeding on plant matter and insects. Its pelvis was robust, its feet and claws large, and its jaws strong, indicating that it foraged near the ground.\n\nThe birds were hunted by settlers on R\u00e9union, who also [[aviculture|kept them as pets]]. Nineteen specimens exist in museums around the world. The hoopoe starling was reported to be in decline by the early 19th century, and was probably extinct before the 1860s. Several factors have been proposed, including competition and predation by introduced species, disease, deforestation and persecution by humans, who hunted it for food and as an alleged crop pest.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:Hoopoe Starling.jpg|upright|left|thumb|alt=Painting of grey-and-white bird with tufted head and curved beak|1770s [[type illustration]] by [[Fran\u00e7ois-Nicolas Martinet]]]]\nThe first account thought to mention the hoopoe starling is a 1658 list of birds of [[Madagascar]] written by French governor [[\u00c9tienne de Flacourt]]. He mentioned a black-and-grey \"tivouch\" or [[hoopoe]]; later authors have wondered whether this referred to the hoopoe starling or the Madagascan subspecies of hoopoe (''Upupa epops marginata''), which resembles the Eurasian subspecies. The hoopoe starling was first noted on the [[Mascarene island]] of [[R\u00e9union]] (then called \"Bourbon\") by P\u00e8re Vachet in 1669, and described in detail by French traveller [[Sieur Dubois]]'s in 1674:<ref name=\"Hume 2014 8\u201314\">Hume, J.

Little was recorded about the hoopoe starling during the next 100&nbsp;years, but specimens began to be brought to Europe during the 18th century. The species was first scientifically described by [[Philippe Gu\u00e9neau de Montbeillard]] in the 1779 edition of [[Comte de Buffon]]'s ''[[Histoire Naturelle]]'', and received its [[scientific name]] from Dutch naturalist [[Pieter Boddaert]] for the book's 1783 edition. Boddaert named the bird ''Upupa varia''; its genus name is that of the hoopoe, and its specific name means \"variegated\", describing its black-and-white colour.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 8\u201314\"/>\n\nBoddaert provided [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnean]] [[binomial nomenclature|binomial]] names for plates in Buffon's works, so the accompanying 1770s plate of the hoopoe starling by French engraver [[Fran\u00e7ois-Nicolas Martinet]] is considered the [[holotype]] or type illustration. Though the plate may have been based on a specimen in the [[National Museum of Natural History in Paris]], this is impossible to determine today; the Paris museum originally had five hoopoe starling skins, some which only arrived during the 19th century. The possibly female specimen MNHN 2000-756, one of the most-illustrated skins, has an artificially trimmed crest resulting in an unnaturally semi-circular shape, unlike its appearance in life; the type illustration has a similarly shaped crest.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 8\u201314\"/>\n[[File:Fregilupus varius - John Gerrard Keulemans improved.jpg|upright|thumb|left|alt=Painting of brown-and-white bird on a branch, with a shorter head tuft|1907 illustration by [[John Gerrard Keulemans]], based on a specimen in Paris with a trimmed crest]]\nDe Flacourt's \"tivouch\" led early writers to believe that variants of the bird were found on Madagascar and the [[Cape of Africa]]; they were thought to be hoopoes of the genus ''Upupa'', which received names such as ''Upupa capensis'' and ''Upupa madagascariensis''. Some authors also allied the bird with groups such as [[birds-of-paradise]], [[bee-eater]]s, [[cowbird]]s, [[Icteridae]], and [[chough]]s, resulting in its reassignment to other genera with new names, such as ''Coracia cristata'' and ''Pastor upupa''. In 1831, French naturalist [[Ren\u00e9-Primev\u00e8re Lesson]] placed the bird in its own [[monotypic]] genus, ''Fregilipus'', a composite of ''Upupa'' and ''Fregilus'', the latter a defunct genus name of the chough. French naturalist [[Auguste Vinson]] established in 1868 that the bird was restricted to the island of R\u00e9union and proposed a new binomial, ''Fregilupus borbonicus'', referring to the former name of the island.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 29\u201344\">Hume, J.

Only three specimens were sexed (all males), with age and individual variation not considered. The male is thought to have been largest with a longer, curvier beak. In 1911, R\u00e9union resident Eug\u00e8ne Jacob de Cordemoy recalled his observations of the bird about 50&nbsp;years before, suggesting that only males had a white crest, but this is thought to be incorrect. A presumed female (MNHN 2000-756) in the Paris museum appears to have a smaller crest, a smaller and less-curved beak, and smaller primary coverts. A juvenile specimen (MHNT O2650) has a smaller crest and primary coverts, with a brown wash instead of ash grey on the crest, lore, and superciliary stripe, and a light-brown (instead of ash-brown) back. The juveniles of some southeast Asian starlings are also browner than adults.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 29\u201344\"/>\n\nVinson, who observed live hoopoe starlings when he lived on R\u00e9union, described the crest as flexible, disunited and forward-curled barbs of various lengths, highest in the centre, and able to be erected at will. He compared the bird's crest to that of a [[cockatoo]] and to the tail feathers of a [[bird-of-paradise]]. Most mounted specimens have an erect crest, indicating its natural position. The only illustration of the hoopoe starling now thought to have been made from life was drawn by French artist Paul Philippe Sauguin de Jossigny during the early 1770s. Jossigny instructed engravers under the drawing that for accuracy, they should depict the crest angled forward from the head (not straight up). Hume believes that Martinet did this when he made the type illustration, and it was derivative of Jossigny's image rather than a life drawing. Jossigny also made the only known life drawing of the now-extinct [[Newton's parakeet]] (''Psittacula exsul'') after a specimen sent to him from Rodrigues to Mauritius, so this is perhaps also where he drew the hoopoe starling. Murie suggested that only the illustrations by Martinet and [[Jacques Barraband]] were \"original\", since he was unaware of Jossigny's drawing, but noted a crudeness and stiffness in them which made neither appear lifelike.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 29\u201344\"/><ref name=\"Murie\"/>\n\n==Behaviour and ecology==\n[[File:Bourbon Crested Starling.jpg|upright|thumb|left|alt=Painting of brown-and-white, crested bird with a long beak, on a branch under an overhanging rock|1910 illustration by Eduard de Maes]]\nLittle is known about the behaviour of the hoopoe starling. According to [[Fran\u00e7ois Levaillant]]'s 1807 account of the bird (which included observations from a R\u00e9union resident) it was abundant, with large flocks inhabiting humid areas and marshes. In 1831, Lesson, without explanation, described its habits as similar to those of a [[crow]]. Its song was described as a \"bright and cheerful whistle\" and \"clear notes\", indicating a similarity to the songs of other starlings.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 29\u201344\"/> Vinson's 1877 account relates his experiences with the bird more than 50&nbsp;years earlier:\n{{Quotation|Now these daughters of the wood, when they were numerous, flew in flocks and went thus in the rain forests, while deviating little from one another, as good companions or as nymphs taking a bath: they lived on berries, seeds and insects, and the cr\u00e9oles, disgusted by the latter fact, held them for an impure game. Sometimes, coming from the woods to the littoral [coast], always flying and leaping from tree to tree, branch to branch, they often alighted in swarms on coffee trees in bloom, and there was in the past the testimony of an inhabitant of the Island of Bourbon, said the naturalist Levaillant, that they caused big damage in coffee trees by making the flowers fall prematurely. But it is not the white flowers of coffee that the hoopoes were searching for and thus behaving so, it was for the caterpillars and insects that devoured them; and in this they made an important service to the silviculture of the Island of Bourbon and the rich coffee plantations, with which this land was then covered, the golden age of the country!<ref name=\"Hume 2014 29\u201344\"/>}}\n[[File:Hoopoe starling skeletal elements.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Drawing of separate bird bones|1874 lithograph of skeletal elements by Berjeau]]\nLike most other starlings, the hoopoe starling was [[omnivorous]], feeding on fruits, seeds, and insects. Its tongue\u2014long, slender, sharp, and frayed\u2014may have been able to move rapidly, helpful when feeding on fruit, nectar, pollen, and invertebrates. Its pelvic elements were robust and its feet and claws large, indicating that it foraged near the ground. Its jaws were strong; Morioka compared its skull to that of the hoopoe, and it may have foraged in a similar way, probing and opening holes in substrate by inserting and opening its beak.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 29\u201344\"/>\n\nDe Montbeillard was informed of the stomach contents of a dissected specimen, consisting of seeds and the berries of \"''Pseudobuxus''\" (possibly ''[[Eugenia buxifolia]]'', a bush with sweet, orange berries). He noted that the bird weighed {{convert|4|oz|g}}, and was fatter around June and July. Several accounts suggest that the hoopoe starling migrated on R\u00e9union, spending six months in the lowlands and six months in the mountains. Food may have been easier to obtain in the lowlands during winter, with the birds breeding in the mountain forests during summer. The hoopoe starling probably nested in tree cavities.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 29\u201344\"/>\n\nMany other endemic species on R\u00e9union became extinct after the arrival of humans and the resulting disruption of the island's [[ecosystem]]. The Hoopoe starling lived with other now-extinct birds, such as the [[R\u00e9union ibis]], the [[Mascarene parrot]], the [[R\u00e9union parakeet]], the [[R\u00e9union swamphen]], the [[R\u00e9union owl]], the [[R\u00e9union night heron]], and the [[R\u00e9union pink pigeon]]. Extinct R\u00e9union reptiles include the [[R\u00e9union giant tortoise]] and an undescribed ''[[Leiolopisma]]'' [[skink]]. The [[small Mauritian flying fox]] and the snail ''[[Tropidophora carinata]]'' lived on R\u00e9union and Mauritius before vanishing from both islands.<ref name=\"Lost Land\">{{cite book\n| last1 = Cheke | first1 = A.

In 1704, French pilot engineer [[Jean Feuilley]] explained how the birds were caught by humans and cats:\n{{Quotation|Hoopoes and merles [''[[Hypsipetes borbonicus]]''] are the same fatness as those in France, and are of a marvellous taste, which are fat at the same time as parrots, living on the same foods. In order to catch them, hunting was done with staffs or long thin poles from six to seven feet in length, though this hunt is infrequently seen. The marrons [escaped] cats destroy many. These birds allow themselves to be approached very closely, so the cats take them without leaving their places.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 29\u201344\"/>}}\n\nThe hoopoe starling was [[aviculture|kept as a pet]] on R\u00e9union and Mauritius, and although the bird was becoming scarcer, some specimens were obtained during the early 19th century. It is unknown whether any live specimens were ever transported from the Mascarenes. Cordemoy recalled that captive birds could be fed a wide variety of food, such as bananas, potatoes, and [[chayote]], and wild birds would never enter inhabited areas. Many individuals survived on Mauritius after escaping there, and it was thought that a feral population could be established. The Mauritian population lasted less than a decade; the final specimen on the island (the last definite record of a live specimen anywhere) was taken in 1836. Specimens could still be collected on R\u00e9union during the 1830s and, possibly, the early 1840s.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 29\u201344\"/>\n\nThere are nineteen surviving hoopoe starling specimens in museums around the world (including one skeleton and two specimens preserved in spirit), with two in the Paris museum and four in [[Troyes]]. Additional skins in Turin, Livorno, and Caen were destroyed during [[World War II]], and four skins have disappeared from R\u00e9union and Mauritius (which now have one each). Specimens were sent to Europe beginning in the second half of the 18th century, with most collected during the first half of the 19th century. It is unclear when each specimen was acquired, and specimens were frequently moved between collections. It is also unclear which specimens were the basis for which descriptions and illustrations.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 29\u201344\"/> The only known subfossil hoopoe starling specimen is a femur, discovered in 1993 in a R\u00e9union [[grotto]].<ref name=\"Avifauna\">{{Cite journal\n| last1 = Mourer-Chauvire\n| first1 = C.\n| last2 = Bour\n| first2 = R.\n| last3 = Ribes\n| first3 = S.\n| last4 = Moutou\n| first4 = F.\n| title = Avian paleontology at the close of the 20th century: The avifauna of R\u00e9union Island (Mascarene Islands) at the time of the arrival of the first Europeans\n| journal = [[Smithsonian Contributions to Paleobiology]]\n| volume = 89\n| pages = 8\u201311\n| date =\n| year = 1999\n| hdl = 10088/2005\n}}</ref>\n\n===Extinction===\n[[File:Hoopoe starling Roussin.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Painting of bright-eyed hoopoe starling on a tree branch|1860s illustration by Albert Roussin]]\nSeveral causes for the decline and sudden disappearance of the hoopoe starling have been proposed, all connected to the activities of humans on R\u00e9union, who it survived alongside for two centuries. An oft-repeated suggestion is that the introduction of the [[common myna]] (''Acridotheres tristis'') led to competition between these two starling species. The myna was introduced to R\u00e9union in 1759 to combat locusts, and became a pest itself, but the hoopoe starling coexisted with the myna for nearly 100&nbsp;years and they may not have shared habitat. The [[black rat]] (''Rattus rattus'') arrived on Reunion in the 1670s, and the [[brown rat]] (''Rattus norvegicus'') in 1735, multiplying rapidly and threatening agriculture and native species. Like the hoopoe starling, the rats inhabited tree cavities and would have preyed on eggs, juveniles, and nesting birds. During the mid-19th century the [[R\u00e9union slit-eared skink]] (''Gongylomorphus borbonicus'') became extinct due to predation by the introduced [[wolf snake]] (''Lycodon aulicum''), which may have deprived the bird of a significant food source.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 29\u201344\"/> Hoopoe starlings may have contracted diseases from introduced birds, a factor known to have triggered declines and extinctions in endemic Hawaiian birds. According to British ecologist Anthony S. Cheke, this was the chief cause of the hoopoe starling's extinction; the species had survived for generations despite other threats.<ref name=\"Cheke87\">{{Cite book| last1 = Cheke | first1 = A.

Former slaves joined white peasants in cultivating pristine areas after slavery was abolished in 1848, and the hoopoe starling was pushed to the edges of its former habitat. According to Hume, over-hunting was the final blow to the species; with forests more accessible, hunting by the rapidly growing human population may have driven the remaining birds to extinction. In 1821, a law mandating the extermination of grain-damaging birds was implemented, and the hoopoe starling had a reputation for damaging crops. During the 1860s, various writers noted that the bird had almost disappeared, but it was probably already extinct by this time; in 1877, Vinson lamented that the last individuals might have been killed by recent forest fires. No attempts to preserve the species in captivity seem to have been made.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 29\u201344\"/><ref name=Vinson-1877>{{cite journal |last1=Vinson |first1=A. |title=Faune d\u00e9truite.

The Rodrigues and Mauritius species probably disappeared with the arrival of rats; at least five species of ''[[Aplonis]]'' starlings have disappeared from the [[Pacific Islands]], with rats contributing to their extinction. The hoopoe starling may have survived longer due to R\u00e9union's rugged [[topography]] and highlands, where it spent much of the year.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 55\u201358\">Hume, J. P.
