He held 42 patents and received numerous awards, including the first [[IEEE Medal of Honor|Medal of Honor]] awarded by the Institute of Radio Engineers (now [[IEEE]]), the French [[Legion of Honor]], the 1941 [[Franklin Medal]] and the 1942 [[Edison Medal]]. He was inducted into the [[National Inventors Hall of Fame]] and included in the [[International Telecommunication Union]]'s roster of great inventors.\n\n==Early life==\n\n[[File:EdwinHArmstrongHouse c1975.jpg|right|thumb|Armstrong's boyhood home, 1032 Warburton Avenue, overlooking the Hudson River in Yonkers, New York, c. 1975. It was demolished in November 1982 due to fire damage.]]\n\nArmstrong was born in the [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]] district of New York City, the oldest of John and Emily  (n\u00e9e Smith) Armstrong's three children.<ref name=\"Columbia\"/> His father began working at a young age at the American branch of the [[Oxford University Press]], which published bibles and standard classical works, eventually advancing to the position of vice president.<ref name=\"nyt19540202\" /> His parents first met at the North Presbyterian Church, located at 31st Street and Ninth Avenue. His mother's family had strong ties to Chelsea, and an active role in church functions.<ref>''Man of High Fidelity'' by Lawrence Lessing (1956) [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.189098/page/n21/mode/1up p. 22]</ref> When the church moved north, the Smiths and Armstrongs followed, and in 1895 the Armstrong family moved from their brownstone row house at 347 West 29th Street to a similar house at 26 West 97th Street in the [[Upper West Side]].<ref>Lessing 1956, [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.189098/page/n22/mode/1up p. 23]</ref> The family was comfortably middle class.\n\nAt the age of eight, Armstrong contracted [[Sydenham's chorea]] (then known as [[Sydenham's chorea|St. Vitus' Dance]]), an infrequent but serious neurological disorder precipitated by rheumatic fever. For the rest of his life, Armstrong was afflicted with a physical [[tic]] exacerbated by excitement or stress. Due to this illness, he withdrew from public school and was home-tutored for two years.<ref>Lessing 1956, [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.189098/page/n25/mode/1up p. 26]</ref> To improve his health, the Armstrong family moved to a house overlooking the Hudson River, at 1032 Warburton Avenue in [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]]. The Smith family subsequently moved next door.<ref>Lessing 1956, [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.189098/page/n23/mode/1up p. 24]</ref> Armstrong's tic and the time missed from school led him to become socially withdrawn.\n\nFrom an early age, Armstrong showed an interest in electrical and mechanical devices, particularly trains.<ref name=\"Lessing-320\">Lessing 1956, [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.189098/page/n26/mode/1up p. 27]</ref> He loved heights and constructed a makeshift backyard antenna tower that included a [[bosun's chair]] for hoisting himself up and down its length, to the concern of neighbors. Much of his early research was conducted in the attic of his parents' house.<ref name=\"Wu-126\">{{harvnb|Wu|2010|p=126}}</ref>\n\nIn 1909, Armstrong enrolled at [[Columbia University]] in New York City, where he became a member of the Epsilon Chapter of the [[Theta Xi]] engineering fraternity, and studied under Professor [[Mihajlo Pupin|Michael Pupin]] at the Hartley Laboratories, a separate research unit at Columbia. Another of his instructors, Professor John H. Morecroft, later remembered Armstrong as being intensely focused on the topics that interested him, but somewhat indifferent to the rest of his studies.<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=iau.31858044013914&view=1up&seq=274 \"What Everyone Should Know About Radio History: Part II\"] by Prof. J. H. Morecroft, ''Radio Broadcast'', August 1922, pages 294-302.</ref> Armstrong challenged conventional wisdom and was quick to question the opinions of both professors and peers. In one case, he recounted how he tricked an instructor he disliked into receiving a severe electrical shock.<ref>''Empire of the Air'' by Tom Lewis, 1991, pages 60-61.</ref> He also stressed the practical over the theoretical, stating that progress was more likely the product of experimentation and reasoning than on mathematical calculation and the formulae of \"[[mathematical physics]]\".\n\nArmstrong graduated from Columbia in 1913, earning an electrical engineering degree.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite book|title=Who Was Who in American History - the Military|date=1975|publisher=Marquis Who's Who|location=Chicago|isbn=0837932017|page=15}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War I]], Armstrong served in the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]] as a captain and later a major.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nFollowing college graduation, he received a $600 one-year appointment as a laboratory assistant at Columbia, after which he nominally worked as a research assistant, for a salary of $1 a year, under Professor Pupin.<ref>''The Legacies of Edwin Howard Armstrong'', \"E. H. Armstrong\" by Thomas Sykes, 1990, page 22.</ref> Unlike most engineers, Armstrong never became a corporate employee. He set up a self-financed independent research and development laboratory at Columbia, and owned his patents outright.\n\nIn 1934, he filled the vacancy left by John H. Morecroft's death, receiving an appointment as a Professor of Electrical Engineering at Columbia, a position he held the remainder of his life.<ref name=\"nyt19340807\">{{cite news |title=Major Armstrong Goes to Columbia |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331 |date=August 7, 1934 |page=20 |quote=The appointment of Major Edwin Howard Armstrong as Professor of Electrical Engineering at Columbia University yesterday by Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, president of the university.}}</ref>\n\n==Early work==\n\n===Regenerative circuit===\n[[File:Armstrong circuit.png|right|thumb|350px|Armstrong's \"feed back\" circuit drawing, from ''Radio Broadcast'' vol. 1 no. 1 1922.]]\n\nArmstrong began working on his first major invention while still an undergraduate at Columbia. In late 1906, [[Lee de Forest]] had invented the three-element (triode) [[audion|\"grid Audion\"]] vacuum-tube. How vacuum tubes worked was not understood at the time.  De Forest's initial Audions did not have a high vacuum and developed a blue glow at modest plate voltages; De Forest improved the vacuum for Federal Telegraph.<ref>''DeForest Radio Co. v. General Electric Co.'', [https://law.resource.org/pub/us/case/reporter/US/283/283.US.664.630.html 283 U.S. 664] (May 25, 1931). Fleming and Lilenfeld had advocated high vacuum. \"Of critical importance in the present controversy is the effect of the presence of gas within the tube.\"  \"In consequence, the low vacuum tube is more sensitive both as a detector and as an amplifier than a tube of high vacuum.\" \"August 20, 1912, the earliest date claimed for Langmuir, was rejected rightly, we think, by the District Court, which held that Langmuir was anticipated by Arnold in November, 1912. But before the earlier date, De Forest sought and obtained a high vacuum in the audions used as amplifiers, and observed that when the vacuum was too low the blue glow effect occurred at from 15 to 20 volts. To secure higher voltages from the audions used as amplifiers and to procure the requisite high vacuum, he had some of the bulbs re-exhausted while superheated. By August 1912, the Telegraph Company used De Forest amplifying audions at 54 volts, and by November, they were used by another at 67.5 volts. This was possible only because the tubes had been exhausted of gas, which would otherwise have ionized with blue glow at from 20 to 30 volts.\"</ref> By 1912, vacuum tube operation was understood, and regenerative circuits using high vacuum tubes were appreciated.\n\nWhile growing up, Armstrong had experimented with the early temperamental, \"gassy\" Audions. Spurred by the later discoveries, he developed a keen interest in gaining a detailed scientific understanding of how vacuum tubes worked. In conjunction with Professor Morecroft he used an [[oscillograph]] to conduct comprehensive studies.<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x002212112&view=1up&seq=1175 \"Operating Features of the Audion\"] by E.

Further investigation revealed that when the feedback was increased beyond a certain level a vacuum-tube would go into [[Electronic oscillator|oscillation]], thus could also be used as a continuous-wave radio transmitter.\n\nBeginning in 1913 Armstrong prepared a series of comprehensive demonstrations and papers that carefully documented his research,<ref name=\"Armstrong-audion\">{{cite journal |doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1916.tb55188.x |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hwsqz1&view=1up&seq=275 |first=E.

On October 6, 1914, {{US patent|1,113,149}} was issued for his discovery.<ref>Lewis (1991), pages 77, 87.</ref> Although Lee de Forest initially discounted Armstrong's findings, beginning in 1915 de Forest filed a series of competing patent applications that largely copied Armstrong's claims, now stating that he had discovered regeneration first, based on August 6, 1912 notebook entry, while working for the Federal Telegraph company, prior to the January 31, 1913 date recognized for Armstrong. The result was an interference hearing at the patent office to determine priority. De Forest was not the only other inventor involved \u2013 the four competing claimants included Armstrong, de Forest, General Electric's Langmuir, and Alexander Meissner, who was a German national, which led to his application being seized by the [[Office of Alien Property Custodian]] during World War I.<ref>''Ibid.'', page 192.</ref>\n\nFollowing the end of WWI Armstrong enlisted representation by the law firm of Pennie, Davis, Martin and Edmonds. To finance his legal expenses he began issuing non-transferable licenses for use of the regenerative patents to a select group of small radio equipment firms, and by November 1920 17 companies had been licensed.<ref>''Invention and Innovation in the Radio Industry'' by W. Rupert Maclaurin, 1949, page 122.</ref> These licensees paid 5% royalties on their sales which were restricted to only \"amateurs and experimenters\". Meanwhile, Armstrong reviewed his options for selling the commercial rights to his work. Although the obvious candidate was the [[Radio Corporation of America]] (RCA), on October 5, 1920 the [[Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company]] took out an option for $335,000 for the commercial rights for both the regenerative and superheterodyne patents, with an additional $200,000 to be paid if Armstrong prevailed in the regenerative patent dispute. Westinghouse exercised this option on November 4, 1920.<ref>''Radio Manufacturers of the 1920s: Volume 3'' by Alan Douglas, 1991, page 3. Organized broadcasting barely existed when the initial amateur and experimental licenses where granted. By 1922 a broadcast boom in the US saw tremendous growth in the sale of radio receivers to the general public. Westinghouse tried to claim that these sales infringed on its rights, as they should be considered \"commercial\", but the courts disagreed. Thus, the companies that held these \"amateur and experimental\" license rights found they now had a valuable asset.</ref>\n\nLegal proceedings related to the regeneration patent became separated into two groups of court cases. An initial court action was triggered in 1919 when Armstrong sued de Forest's company in district court, alleging infringement of patent 1,113,149. This court ruled in Armstrong's favor on May 17, 1921. A second line of court cases, the result of the patent office interference hearing, had a different outcome. The interference board had also sided with Armstrong, but he was unwilling to settle with de Forest for less than what he considered full compensation. Thus pressured, de Forest continued his legal defense, and appealed the interference board decision to the District of Columbia district court. On May 8, 1924, that court ruled that it was de Forest who should be considered regeneration's inventor. Armstrong (along with much of the engineering community) was shocked by these events, and his side appealed this decision. Although the legal proceeding twice went before the US Supreme Court, in 1928 and 1934, he was unsuccessful in overturning the decision.<ref>Douglas (1991), pages 193-198, 203.</ref>\n\nIn response to the second Supreme Court decision upholding de Forest as the inventor of regeneration, Armstrong attempted to return his 1917 IRE Medal of Honor, which had been awarded \"in recognition of his work and publications dealing with the action of the oscillating and non-oscillating audion\". The organization's board refused to allow him, and issued a statement that it \"strongly affirms the original award\".\n\n===Superheterodyne circuit===\n\n[[File:Edwin H Armstrong in WWI 1922.png|thumb|right|Armstrong in his [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]] uniform during [[World War I]]]]\nThe United States entered into WWI in April 1917. Later that year Armstrong was commissioned as a Captain in the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Signal Corps]], and assigned to a laboratory in Paris, France to help develop radio communication for the Allied war effort. He returned to the US in the autumn of 1919, after being promoted to the rank of Major.<ref name=\"Lessing-320\" /> (During both world wars, Armstrong gave the US military free use of his patents.)\n\nDuring this period Armstrong's most significant accomplishment was the development of a \"supersonic heterodyne\" \u2013 soon shortened to \"superheterodyne\" \u2013 radio receiver circuit.<ref name=\"nyt19540202\" /> This circuit made radio receivers more sensitive and selective and is extensively used today. The key feature of the superheterodyne approach is the mixing of the incoming radio signal with a locally generated, different frequency signal within a radio set. This circuit is called the mixer. The result is a fixed, unchanging intermediate frequency, or I.F. signal which is easily amplified and detected by following circuit stages. In 1919, Armstrong filed an application for a US patent of the superheterodyne circuit which was issued the next year. This patent was subsequently sold to Westinghouse.<ref>MacLaurin (1949), page 106. \"Westinghouse then made an even more important move by purchasing [on May 22, 1920] for $335,000 the Armstrong patents on the regenerative and superheterodyne circuits.\"</ref> The patent was be challenged, triggering another patent office interference hearing.<ref name=\"who\">[http://antiqueradios.com/superhet/ \"Who Invented the Superheterodyne?\"] by Alan Douglas, originally published in ''The Legacies of Edwin Howard Armstrong'' from the \"Proceedings of the Radio Club of America\", Nov. 1990, Vol.64 no.3, pages 123-142. Page 139: \"L\u00e9vy broadened his claims to purposely create an interference, by copying Armstrong's claims exactly. The Patent Office would then have to choose between the two inventors.\"</ref> Armstrong ultimately lost this patent battle; although the outcome was less controversial than that involving the regeneration proceedings.<ref>Lewis (1991), page 205. \"...the case did not seem to affect Armstrong emotionally in the same way the regeneration suit did... Possibly he recognized the Frenchman did have some legitimate claim to the invention... Armstrong respected Levy in a way that he could not respect de Forest...\"</ref>\n\nThe challenger was [[Lucien L\u00e9vy]] of France who had worked developing Allied radio communication during WWI. He had been awarded French patents in 1917 and 1918 that covered some of the same basic ideas used in Armstrong's superheterodyne receiver. AT&T, interested in radio development at this time, primarily for point-to-point extensions of its wired telephone exchanges, purchased the US rights to L\u00e9vy's patent and contested Armstrong's grant. The subsequent court reviews continued until 1928, when the District of Columbia Court of Appeals disallowed all nine claims of Armstrong's patent, assigning priority for seven of the claims to L\u00e9vy, and one each to [[Ernst Alexanderson]] of General Electric and Burton W. Kendall of [[Bell Laboratories]].<ref>''The Continuous Wave: Technology and American Radio, 1900-1932'' by Hugh G. J. Aitken, 1985, page 467.</ref>\n\nAlthough most early radio receivers used regeneration Armstrong approached RCA's [[David Sarnoff]], whom he had known since giving a demonstration of his regeneration receiver in 1913, about the corporation offering superheterodynes as a superior offering to the general public.<ref>''History of Radio to 1926'' by Gleason L. Archer, 1938, [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89074767138&view=1up&seq=343 page 297]: \"It appears that Armstrong first exhibited the device to the astute General Manager of RCA, David Sarnoff. Mr. Sarnoff had just concluded arrangements that involved ordering several millions' dollars worth of an improved type of radio... He was so impressed by the Armstrong invention that he at once halted these negotiations...\"</ref> (The ongoing patent dispute was not a hindrance, because extensive cross-licensing agreements signed in 1920 and 1921 between RCA, Westinghouse and AT&T meant that Armstrong could freely use the L\u00e9vy patent.) Superheterodyne sets were initially thought to be prohibitively complicated and expensive as the initial designs required multiple tuning knobs and used nine vacuum tubes. In conjunction with RCA engineers, Armstrong developed a simpler, less costly design. RCA introduced its superheterodyne Radiola sets in the US market in early 1924, and they were an immediate success, dramatically increasing the corporation's profits. These sets were considered so valuable that RCA would not license the superheterodyne to other US companies until 1930.<ref name=\"who\"/>\n\n===Super-regeneration circuit===\n\n[[Image:Edwin Armstrong at blackboard.jpg|thumb|Armstrong explaining the superregenerative circuit, New York, 1922]]\nThe regeneration legal battle had one serendipitous outcome for Armstrong. While he was preparing apparatus to counteract a claim made by a patent attorney, he \"accidentally ran into the phenomenon of super-regeneration\", where, by rapidly \"quenching\" the vacuum-tube oscillations, he was able to achieve even greater levels of amplification. A year later, in 1922, Armstrong sold his super-regeneration patent to RCA for $200,000 plus 60,000 shares of corporation stock, which was later increased to 80,000 shares in payment for consulting services. This made Armstrong RCA's largest shareholder, and he noted that \"The sale of that invention was to net me more than the sale of the regenerative circuit and the superheterodyne combined\".<ref>Maclaurin (1949). October 12, 1947 letter from Armstrong to the author, page 122.</ref> RCA envisioned selling a line of super-regenerative receivers until superheterodyne sets could be perfected for general sales, but it turned out the circuit was not selective enough to make it practical for broadcast receivers.\n\n==Wide-band FM radio==\n\n\"Static\" interference \u2013 extraneous noises caused by sources such as thunderstorms and electrical equipment \u2013 bedeviled early radio communication using [[amplitude modulation]]  and perplexed numerous inventors attempting to eliminate it. Many ideas for static elimination were investigated, with little success. In the mid-1920s, Armstrong began researching a solution. He initially, and unsuccessfully, attempted to resolve the problem by modifying the characteristics of AM transmissions.\n\nOne approach had been the use of [[frequency modulation]] (FM) transmissions. Instead of varying the strength of the carrier wave as with AM, the frequency of the carrier was changed to represent the desired audio signal. In 1922 [[John Renshaw Carson]] of AT&T, inventor of [[Single-sideband modulation]] (SSB), had published a detailed mathematical analysis which showed that FM transmissions did not provide any improvement over AM.<ref>{{citation |first=J. R. |last=Carson |authorlink=John Renshaw Carson |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=chi.101888973&view=1up&seq=65 |title=Notes on the theory of modulation |journal=Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers |volume=10 |issue=1 |date=February 1922 |pages=57\u201364 |doi=10.1109/jrproc.1922.219793}}</ref> Although the [[Carson bandwidth rule]] for FM is important today, this review turned out to be incomplete, because it analyzed only what is now known as \"narrow-band\" FM.\n\nIn early 1928 Armstrong began researching the capabilities of FM. Although there were others involved in FM research at this time, he knew of an RCA project to see if FM shortwave transmissions were less susceptible to fading than AM. In 1931 the RCA engineers constructed a successful FM shortwave link transmitting the Schmeling\u2013[[Young Stribling|Stribling]] fight broadcast from California to Hawaii, and noted at the time that the signals seemed to be less affected by static. The project made little further progress.<ref>''Early FM Radio'' by Gary L. Frost, 2010, pages 72-73.</ref>\n\nWorking in secret in the basement laboratory of Columbia's [[Philosophy Hall]], Armstrong developed \"wide-band\" FM, in the process discovering significant advantages over the earlier \"narrow-band\" FM transmissions. In a [[Frequency modulation#modulation index|\"wide-band\" FM system]], the deviations of the carrier frequency are made to be much larger in magnitude than the frequency of the audio signal; this can be shown to provide better noise rejection. He was granted five US patents covering the basic features of new system on December 26, 1933.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fathom.com/seminars/10701020/session2.html |title=Air War: Legal Battles Over FM Radio |first=Dana M |last=Raymond |work=Fathom |publisher=Columbia University |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515054100/http://www.fathom.com/seminars/10701020/session2.html |archivedate=May 15, 2008 |df=mdy }}</ref> Initially, the primary claim was that his FM system was effective at filtering out the noise produced in receivers by vacuum tubes.<ref>Frost (2010), page 95.</ref>\n\nArmstrong had a standing agreement to give RCA the [[right of first refusal]] to his patents. In 1934 he presented his new system to RCA president Sarnoff. Sarnoff was somewhat taken aback by its complexity, as he had hoped it would be possible to eliminate static merely by adding a simple device to existing receivers. From May 1934 until October 1935 Armstrong conducted field tests of his FM technology from an RCA laboratory located on the 85th floor of the [[Empire State Building]] in New York City. An antenna attached to the building's spire transmitted signals for distances up to {{convert|80|mi|km}}.<ref name=\"Wu-125\">{{harvnb|Wu|2010|p=125}}</ref> These tests helped demonstrate FM's static-reduction and high-fidelity capabilities. RCA, which was heavily invested in perfecting TV broadcasting, chose not to invest in FM, and instructed Armstrong to remove his equipment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://users.erols.com/oldradio/eha65.htm |title=Beginning of Armstrong's FM station W2XMN at Alpine, NJ (1937) |first=Mike |last=Katzdorn |website= |accessdate=December 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\nDenied the marketing and financial clout of RCA, Armstrong decided to finance his own development and form ties with smaller members of the radio industry, including [[Zenith Electronics|Zenith]] and [[General Electric]], to promote his invention. Armstrong thought that FM had the potential to replace AM stations within 5 years, which he promoted as a boost for the radio manufacturing industry, then suffering from the effects of the [[Great Depression]]. Making existing AM radio transmitters and receivers obsolete would necessitate that stations buy replacement transmitters and listeners purchase FM-capable receivers. In 1936 he published a landmark paper in the ''Proceedings of the IRE'' that documented the superior capabilities of using wide-band FM.<ref>{{citation|first=E.

For comparison, he played a jazz record using a conventional AM radio, then switched to an FM transmission. A [[United Press International|United Press]] correspondent was present, and recounted in a wire service report that: \"if the audience of 500 engineers had shut their eyes they would have believed the jazz band was in the same room. There were no extraneous sounds.\" Moreover, \"Several engineers said after the demonstration that they consider Dr. Armstrong's invention one of the most important radio developments since the first earphone crystal sets were introduced.\" Armstrong was quoted as saying he could \"visualize a time not far distant when the use of ultra-high frequency wave bands will play the leading role in all broadcasting\", although the article noted that \"A switchover to the ultra-high frequency system would mean the junking of present broadcasting equipment and present receivers in homes, eventually causing the expenditure of billions of dollars.\"<ref>\"New Radio Shown\" (UP), ''Bellingham (Washington) Herald'', June 17, 1936, page 2.</ref>\n\nIn the late 1930s, as technical advances made it possible to transmit on higher frequencies, the FCC investigated options for increasing the number of broadcasting stations, in addition to ideas for better audio quality, known as \"high-fidelity\". In 1937 it introduced what became known as the [[Apex (radio band)|Apex band]], consisting of 75 broadcasting frequencies from 41.02 to 43.98&nbsp;MHz. As on the standard broadcast band these were AM stations, but with higher quality audio \u2013 in one example, a frequency response from 20&nbsp;Hz to 17,000&nbsp;Hz +/-&nbsp;1&nbsp;dB \u2013 because station separations were 40&nbsp;kHz instead of the 10&nbsp;kHz spacings used on the original AM band.<ref>[http://www.theradiohistorian.org/Apex/Apex1.htm America's Apex Broadcasting Stations of the 1930s] by John Schneider.</ref> Armstrong worked to convince the FCC that a band of FM broadcasting stations would be a superior approach. That year he financed the construction of the first FM radio station, [[Armstrong Tower|W2XMN]] (later KE2XCC) at Alpine, New Jersey. FCC engineers had believed that transmissions using high frequencies would travel little farther than line-of-sight distances, limited by the horizon. When operating with 40 kilowatts on 42.8&nbsp;MHz, the station could be clearly heard {{convert|100|mi|km}} away, matching the daytime coverage of a full power 50-kilowatt AM station.<ref>{{cite journal|year=1940 |title=Armstrong, Edwin Howard |journal=Current Biography |pages=23\u201326 |publisher=The H. W. Wilson Company}}</ref>\n\nFCC studies comparing the Apex station transmissions with Armstrong's FM system concluded that his approach was superior. In early 1940, the FCC held hearings on whether to establish a commercial FM service. Following this review, the FCC announced the establishment of an FM band effective January 1, 1941, consisting of forty 200&nbsp;kHz-wide channels on a band from 42-50&nbsp;MHz, with the first five channels reserved for educational stations. Existing Apex stations were notified that they would not be allowed to operate after January 1, 1941 unless they converted to FM.\n\nAlthough there was interest in the new FM band by station owners, construction restrictions that went into place during WWII limited the growth of the new service. Following the end of WWII, the FCC moved to standardize its frequency allocations. One area of concern was the effects of [[Tropospheric propagation|tropospheric]] and [[Sporadic E propagation]], which at times reflected station signals over great distances, causing mutual interference. A particularly controversial proposal, spearheaded by RCA, was that the FM band needed to be shifted to higher frequencies to avoid this problem. This reassignment was fiercely opposed as unneeded by Armstrong, but he lost. The FCC made its decision final on June 27, 1945.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/298622331|title=Device to make FM Radios Work Under FCC Ruling|last=AP|first=|date=June 27, 1945|work=The Miami News|access-date=2017-08-14|at=6-A|language=en|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> It allocated 100 FM channels from 88\u2013108&nbsp;MHz, and assigned the former FM band to 'non government fixed and mobile' (42\u201344&nbsp;MHz), and [[Channel 1 (North American TV)|television channel 1]] (44\u201350&nbsp;MHz), now sidestepping the interference concerns.<ref name=\":0\" /> A period of allowing existing FM stations to broadcast on both low and high bands ended at midnight on January 8, 1949, at which time any low band transmitters were shut down, making obsolete 395,000<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/93688720|title=395,000 FM Radio Sets Must Be Replaced|last=INS|first=|date=June 27, 1945|work=Journal Gazette|access-date=2017-08-14|page=6|language=en|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> receivers that had already been purchased by the public for the original band.

The change was thought to have been favored by AT&T, as the elimination of FM relaying stations would require radio stations to lease wired links from that company. Particularly galling was the FCC assignment of TV channel 1 to the 44-50&nbsp;MHz segment of the old FM band.  Channel 1 was later deleted, since periodic [[radio propagation]] would make local TV signals unviewable.\n\nAlthough the FM band shift was an economic setback, there was reason for optimism. A book published in 1946 by Charles A. Siepmann heralded FM stations as \"Radio's Second Chance\".<ref>''Radio's Second Chance'' by Charles A. Siepmann, 1946, pages 239-253.</ref> In late 1945, Armstrong contracted with John Orr Young, founding member of the public relations firm [[Young & Rubicam]], to conduct a national campaign promoting FM broadcasting, especially by educational institutions. Article placements promoting both Armstrong personally and FM were made with general circulation publications including ''[[The Nation]]'', ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'', and ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''.<ref>[https://scholarworks.rit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4076&context=theses \"A Case study of Edwin Howard Armstrong's public relations campaign for FM\"] (thesis) by Jessica Francis, December 14, 2012, pages 16, 19.</ref>\n\nIn 1940, RCA offered Armstrong $1,000,000 for a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use his FM patents. He refused this offer, because he felt this would be unfair to the other licensed companies, which had to pay 2% royalties on their sales. Over time this impasse with RCA dominated Armstrong's life. RCA countered by conducting its own FM research, eventually developing what it claimed was a non-infringing FM system. The corporation encouraged other companies to stop paying royalties to Armstrong. Outraged by this, in 1948 Armstrong filed suit against RCA and the National Broadcasting Company, accusing them of patent infringement and that they had \"deliberately set out to oppose and impair the value\" of his invention, for which he requested treble damages. Although he was confident that this suit would be successful and result in a major monetary award, the protracted legal maneuvering that followed eventually began to impair his finances, especially after his primary patents expired in late 1950.<ref>Lewis (1991), pages 247-278, 300-328.</ref>\n\n==FM Doppler radar==\n\nDuring World War II, Armstrong turned his attention to investigations of continuous wave FM [[Doppler radar]] funded by government contracts.<ref>[https://blogs.cul.columbia.edu/armstrongpapers/tag/robert-e-hull/ \"Major Armstrong: Scientist, Technologist, Philosopher: Radar\"], by Jennifer Comins, July 22, 2010.

In late 1906, [[Lee de Forest]] had invented the three-element (triode) [[audion|\"grid Audion\"]] vacuum-tube. How vacuum tubes worked was not understood at the time.  De Forest's initial Audions did not have a high vacuum and developed a blue glow at modest plate voltages; De Forest improved the vacuum for Federal Telegraph.<ref>''DeForest Radio Co. v. General Electric Co.'', [https://law.resource.org/pub/us/case/reporter/US/283/283.US.664.630.html 283 U.S. 664] (May 25, 1931). Fleming and Lilenfeld had advocated high vacuum. \"Of critical importance in the present controversy is the effect of the presence of gas within the tube.\"  \"In consequence, the low vacuum tube is more sensitive both as a detector and as an amplifier than a tube of high vacuum.\" \"August 20, 1912, the earliest date claimed for Langmuir, was rejected rightly, we think, by the District Court, which held that Langmuir was anticipated by Arnold in November, 1912. But before the earlier date, De Forest sought and obtained a high vacuum in the audions used as amplifiers, and observed that when the vacuum was too low the blue glow effect occurred at from 15 to 20 volts. To secure higher voltages from the audions used as amplifiers and to procure the requisite high vacuum, he had some of the bulbs re-exhausted while superheated. By August 1912, the Telegraph Company used De Forest amplifying audions at 54 volts, and by November, they were used by another at 67.5 volts. This was possible only because the tubes had been exhausted of gas, which would otherwise have ionized with blue glow at from 20 to 30 volts.\"</ref> By 1912, vacuum tube operation was understood, and regenerative circuits using high vacuum tubes were appreciated.\n\nWhile growing up, Armstrong had experimented with the early temperamental, \"gassy\" Audions. Spurred by the later discoveries, he developed a keen interest in gaining a detailed scientific understanding of how vacuum tubes worked. In conjunction with Professor Morecroft he used an [[oscillograph]] to conduct comprehensive studies.<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x002212112&view=1up&seq=1175 \"Operating Features of the Audion\"] by E. H. Armstrong, ''Electrical World'', December 12, 1914, pages 1149-1152.</ref> His breakthrough discovery was determining that employing [[Positive feedback#In electronics|positive feedback]] (also known as [[Regenerative circuit|\"regeneration\"]]) produced amplification hundreds of times greater than previously attained, with the amplified signals now strong enough so that receivers could use loudspeakers instead of headphones. Further investigation revealed that when the feedback was increased beyond a certain level a vacuum-tube would go into [[Electronic oscillator|oscillation]], thus could also be used as a continuous-wave radio transmitter.\n\nBeginning in 1913 Armstrong prepared a series of comprehensive demonstrations and papers that carefully documented his research,<ref name=\"Armstrong-audion\">{{cite journal |doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1916.tb55188.x |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hwsqz1&view=1up&seq=275 |first=E.

On October 6, 1914, {{US patent|1,113,149}} was issued for his discovery.<ref>Lewis (1991), pages 77, 87.</ref> Although Lee de Forest initially discounted Armstrong's findings, beginning in 1915 de Forest filed a series of competing patent applications that largely copied Armstrong's claims, now stating that he had discovered regeneration first, based on August 6, 1912 notebook entry, while working for the Federal Telegraph company, prior to the January 31, 1913 date recognized for Armstrong. The result was an interference hearing at the patent office to determine priority. De Forest was not the only other inventor involved \u2013 the four competing claimants included Armstrong, de Forest, General Electric's Langmuir, and Alexander Meissner, who was a German national, which led to his application being seized by the [[Office of Alien Property Custodian]] during World War I.<ref>''Ibid.'', page 192.</ref>\n\nFollowing the end of WWI Armstrong enlisted representation by the law firm of Pennie, Davis, Martin and Edmonds. To finance his legal expenses he began issuing non-transferable licenses for use of the regenerative patents to a select group of small radio equipment firms, and by November 1920 17 companies had been licensed.<ref>''Invention and Innovation in the Radio Industry'' by W. Rupert Maclaurin, 1949, page 122.</ref> These licensees paid 5% royalties on their sales which were restricted to only \"amateurs and experimenters\". Meanwhile, Armstrong reviewed his options for selling the commercial rights to his work. Although the obvious candidate was the [[Radio Corporation of America]] (RCA), on October 5, 1920 the [[Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company]] took out an option for $335,000 for the commercial rights for both the regenerative and superheterodyne patents, with an additional $200,000 to be paid if Armstrong prevailed in the regenerative patent dispute. Westinghouse exercised this option on November 4, 1920.<ref>''Radio Manufacturers of the 1920s: Volume 3'' by Alan Douglas, 1991, page 3. Organized broadcasting barely existed when the initial amateur and experimental licenses where granted. By 1922 a broadcast boom in the US saw tremendous growth in the sale of radio receivers to the general public. Westinghouse tried to claim that these sales infringed on its rights, as they should be considered \"commercial\", but the courts disagreed. Thus, the companies that held these \"amateur and experimental\" license rights found they now had a valuable asset.</ref>\n\nLegal proceedings related to the regeneration patent became separated into two groups of court cases. An initial court action was triggered in 1919 when Armstrong sued de Forest's company in district court, alleging infringement of patent 1,113,149. This court ruled in Armstrong's favor on May 17, 1921. A second line of court cases, the result of the patent office interference hearing, had a different outcome. The interference board had also sided with Armstrong, but he was unwilling to settle with de Forest for less than what he considered full compensation. Thus pressured, de Forest continued his legal defense, and appealed the interference board decision to the District of Columbia district court. On May 8, 1924, that court ruled that it was de Forest who should be considered regeneration's inventor. Armstrong (along with much of the engineering community) was shocked by these events, and his side appealed this decision. Although the legal proceeding twice went before the US Supreme Court, in 1928 and 1934, he was unsuccessful in overturning the decision.<ref>Douglas (1991), pages 193-198, 203.</ref>\n\nIn response to the second Supreme Court decision upholding de Forest as the inventor of regeneration, Armstrong attempted to return his 1917 IRE Medal of Honor, which had been awarded \"in recognition of his work and publications dealing with the action of the oscillating and non-oscillating audion\". The organization's board refused to allow him, and issued a statement that it \"strongly affirms the original award\".\n\n===Superheterodyne circuit===\n\n[[File:Edwin H Armstrong in WWI 1922.png|thumb|right|Armstrong in his [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]] uniform during [[World War I]]]]\nThe United States entered into WWI in April 1917. Later that year Armstrong was commissioned as a Captain in the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Signal Corps]], and assigned to a laboratory in Paris, France to help develop radio communication for the Allied war effort. He returned to the US in the autumn of 1919, after being promoted to the rank of Major.<ref name=\"Lessing-320\" /> (During both world wars, Armstrong gave the US military free use of his patents.)\n\nDuring this period Armstrong's most significant accomplishment was the development of a \"supersonic heterodyne\" \u2013 soon shortened to \"superheterodyne\" \u2013 radio receiver circuit.<ref name=\"nyt19540202\" /> This circuit made radio receivers more sensitive and selective and is extensively used today. The key feature of the superheterodyne approach is the mixing of the incoming radio signal with a locally generated, different frequency signal within a radio set. This circuit is called the mixer. The result is a fixed, unchanging intermediate frequency, or I.F. signal which is easily amplified and detected by following circuit stages. In 1919, Armstrong filed an application for a US patent of the superheterodyne circuit which was issued the next year. This patent was subsequently sold to Westinghouse.<ref>MacLaurin (1949), page 106. \"Westinghouse then made an even more important move by purchasing [on May 22, 1920] for $335,000 the Armstrong patents on the regenerative and superheterodyne circuits.\"</ref> The patent was be challenged, triggering another patent office interference hearing.<ref name=\"who\">[http://antiqueradios.com/superhet/ \"Who Invented the Superheterodyne?\"] by Alan Douglas, originally published in ''The Legacies of Edwin Howard Armstrong'' from the \"Proceedings of the Radio Club of America\", Nov. 1990, Vol.64 no.3, pages 123-142. Page 139: \"L\u00e9vy broadened his claims to purposely create an interference, by copying Armstrong's claims exactly. The Patent Office would then have to choose between the two inventors.\"</ref> Armstrong ultimately lost this patent battle; although the outcome was less controversial than that involving the regeneration proceedings.<ref>Lewis (1991), page 205. \"...the case did not seem to affect Armstrong emotionally in the same way the regeneration suit did... Possibly he recognized the Frenchman did have some legitimate claim to the invention... Armstrong respected Levy in a way that he could not respect de Forest...\"</ref>\n\nThe challenger was [[Lucien L\u00e9vy]] of France who had worked developing Allied radio communication during WWI. He had been awarded French patents in 1917 and 1918 that covered some of the same basic ideas used in Armstrong's superheterodyne receiver. AT&T, interested in radio development at this time, primarily for point-to-point extensions of its wired telephone exchanges, purchased the US rights to L\u00e9vy's patent and contested Armstrong's grant. The subsequent court reviews continued until 1928, when the District of Columbia Court of Appeals disallowed all nine claims of Armstrong's patent, assigning priority for seven of the claims to L\u00e9vy, and one each to [[Ernst Alexanderson]] of General Electric and Burton W. Kendall of [[Bell Laboratories]].<ref>''The Continuous Wave: Technology and American Radio, 1900-1932'' by Hugh G. J. Aitken, 1985, page 467.</ref>\n\nAlthough most early radio receivers used regeneration Armstrong approached RCA's [[David Sarnoff]], whom he had known since giving a demonstration of his regeneration receiver in 1913, about the corporation offering superheterodynes as a superior offering to the general public.<ref>''History of Radio to 1926'' by Gleason L. Archer, 1938, [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89074767138&view=1up&seq=343 page 297]: \"It appears that Armstrong first exhibited the device to the astute General Manager of RCA, David Sarnoff. Mr. Sarnoff had just concluded arrangements that involved ordering several millions' dollars worth of an improved type of radio... He was so impressed by the Armstrong invention that he at once halted these negotiations...\"</ref> (The ongoing patent dispute was not a hindrance, because extensive cross-licensing agreements signed in 1920 and 1921 between RCA, Westinghouse and AT&T meant that Armstrong could freely use the L\u00e9vy patent.) Superheterodyne sets were initially thought to be prohibitively complicated and expensive as the initial designs required multiple tuning knobs and used nine vacuum tubes. In conjunction with RCA engineers, Armstrong developed a simpler, less costly design. RCA introduced its superheterodyne Radiola sets in the US market in early 1924, and they were an immediate success, dramatically increasing the corporation's profits. These sets were considered so valuable that RCA would not license the superheterodyne to other US companies until 1930.<ref name=\"who\"/>\n\n===Super-regeneration circuit===\n\n[[Image:Edwin Armstrong at blackboard.jpg|thumb|Armstrong explaining the superregenerative circuit, New York, 1922]]\nThe regeneration legal battle had one serendipitous outcome for Armstrong. While he was preparing apparatus to counteract a claim made by a patent attorney, he \"accidentally ran into the phenomenon of super-regeneration\", where, by rapidly \"quenching\" the vacuum-tube oscillations, he was able to achieve even greater levels of amplification. A year later, in 1922, Armstrong sold his super-regeneration patent to RCA for $200,000 plus 60,000 shares of corporation stock, which was later increased to 80,000 shares in payment for consulting services. This made Armstrong RCA's largest shareholder, and he noted that \"The sale of that invention was to net me more than the sale of the regenerative circuit and the superheterodyne combined\".<ref>Maclaurin (1949). October 12, 1947 letter from Armstrong to the author, page 122.</ref> RCA envisioned selling a line of super-regenerative receivers until superheterodyne sets could be perfected for general sales, but it turned out the circuit was not selective enough to make it practical for broadcast receivers.\n\n==Wide-band FM radio==\n\n\"Static\" interference \u2013 extraneous noises caused by sources such as thunderstorms and electrical equipment \u2013 bedeviled early radio communication using [[amplitude modulation]]  and perplexed numerous inventors attempting to eliminate it. Many ideas for static elimination were investigated, with little success. In the mid-1920s, Armstrong began researching a solution. He initially, and unsuccessfully, attempted to resolve the problem by modifying the characteristics of AM transmissions.\n\nOne approach had been the use of [[frequency modulation]] (FM) transmissions. Instead of varying the strength of the carrier wave as with AM, the frequency of the carrier was changed to represent the desired audio signal. In 1922 [[John Renshaw Carson]] of AT&T, inventor of [[Single-sideband modulation]] (SSB), had published a detailed mathematical analysis which showed that FM transmissions did not provide any improvement over AM.<ref>{{citation |first=J.

Although there were others involved in FM research at this time, he knew of an RCA project to see if FM shortwave transmissions were less susceptible to fading than AM. In 1931 the RCA engineers constructed a successful FM shortwave link transmitting the Schmeling\u2013[[Young Stribling|Stribling]] fight broadcast from California to Hawaii, and noted at the time that the signals seemed to be less affected by static. The project made little further progress.<ref>''Early FM Radio'' by Gary L. Frost, 2010, pages 72-73.</ref>\n\nWorking in secret in the basement laboratory of Columbia's [[Philosophy Hall]], Armstrong developed \"wide-band\" FM, in the process discovering significant advantages over the earlier \"narrow-band\" FM transmissions. In a [[Frequency modulation#modulation index|\"wide-band\" FM system]], the deviations of the carrier frequency are made to be much larger in magnitude than the frequency of the audio signal; this can be shown to provide better noise rejection. He was granted five US patents covering the basic features of new system on December 26, 1933.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fathom.com/seminars/10701020/session2.html |title=Air War: Legal Battles Over FM Radio |first=Dana M |last=Raymond |work=Fathom |publisher=Columbia University |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515054100/http://www.fathom.com/seminars/10701020/session2.html |archivedate=May 15, 2008 |df=mdy }}</ref> Initially, the primary claim was that his FM system was effective at filtering out the noise produced in receivers by vacuum tubes.<ref>Frost (2010), page 95.</ref>\n\nArmstrong had a standing agreement to give RCA the [[right of first refusal]] to his patents. In 1934 he presented his new system to RCA president Sarnoff. Sarnoff was somewhat taken aback by its complexity, as he had hoped it would be possible to eliminate static merely by adding a simple device to existing receivers. From May 1934 until October 1935 Armstrong conducted field tests of his FM technology from an RCA laboratory located on the 85th floor of the [[Empire State Building]] in New York City. An antenna attached to the building's spire transmitted signals for distances up to {{convert|80|mi|km}}.<ref name=\"Wu-125\">{{harvnb|Wu|2010|p=125}}</ref> These tests helped demonstrate FM's static-reduction and high-fidelity capabilities. RCA, which was heavily invested in perfecting TV broadcasting, chose not to invest in FM, and instructed Armstrong to remove his equipment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://users.erols.com/oldradio/eha65.htm |title=Beginning of Armstrong's FM station W2XMN at Alpine, NJ (1937) |first=Mike |last=Katzdorn |website= |accessdate=December 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\nDenied the marketing and financial clout of RCA, Armstrong decided to finance his own development and form ties with smaller members of the radio industry, including [[Zenith Electronics|Zenith]] and [[General Electric]], to promote his invention. Armstrong thought that FM had the potential to replace AM stations within 5 years, which he promoted as a boost for the radio manufacturing industry, then suffering from the effects of the [[Great Depression]]. Making existing AM radio transmitters and receivers obsolete would necessitate that stations buy replacement transmitters and listeners purchase FM-capable receivers. In 1936 he published a landmark paper in the ''Proceedings of the IRE'' that documented the superior capabilities of using wide-band FM.<ref>{{citation|first=E.

For comparison, he played a jazz record using a conventional AM radio, then switched to an FM transmission. A [[United Press International|United Press]] correspondent was present, and recounted in a wire service report that: \"if the audience of 500 engineers had shut their eyes they would have believed the jazz band was in the same room. There were no extraneous sounds.\" Moreover, \"Several engineers said after the demonstration that they consider Dr. Armstrong's invention one of the most important radio developments since the first earphone crystal sets were introduced.\" Armstrong was quoted as saying he could \"visualize a time not far distant when the use of ultra-high frequency wave bands will play the leading role in all broadcasting\", although the article noted that \"A switchover to the ultra-high frequency system would mean the junking of present broadcasting equipment and present receivers in homes, eventually causing the expenditure of billions of dollars.\"<ref>\"New Radio Shown\" (UP), ''Bellingham (Washington) Herald'', June 17, 1936, page 2.</ref>\n\nIn the late 1930s, as technical advances made it possible to transmit on higher frequencies, the FCC investigated options for increasing the number of broadcasting stations, in addition to ideas for better audio quality, known as \"high-fidelity\". In 1937 it introduced what became known as the [[Apex (radio band)|Apex band]], consisting of 75 broadcasting frequencies from 41.02 to 43.98&nbsp;MHz. As on the standard broadcast band these were AM stations, but with higher quality audio \u2013 in one example, a frequency response from 20&nbsp;Hz to 17,000&nbsp;Hz +/-&nbsp;1&nbsp;dB \u2013 because station separations were 40&nbsp;kHz instead of the 10&nbsp;kHz spacings used on the original AM band.<ref>[http://www.theradiohistorian.org/Apex/Apex1.htm America's Apex Broadcasting Stations of the 1930s] by John Schneider.</ref> Armstrong worked to convince the FCC that a band of FM broadcasting stations would be a superior approach. That year he financed the construction of the first FM radio station, [[Armstrong Tower|W2XMN]] (later KE2XCC) at Alpine, New Jersey. FCC engineers had believed that transmissions using high frequencies would travel little farther than line-of-sight distances, limited by the horizon. When operating with 40 kilowatts on 42.8&nbsp;MHz, the station could be clearly heard {{convert|100|mi|km}} away, matching the daytime coverage of a full power 50-kilowatt AM station.<ref>{{cite journal|year=1940 |title=Armstrong, Edwin Howard |journal=Current Biography |pages=23\u201326 |publisher=The H. W. Wilson Company}}</ref>\n\nFCC studies comparing the Apex station transmissions with Armstrong's FM system concluded that his approach was superior. In early 1940, the FCC held hearings on whether to establish a commercial FM service. Following this review, the FCC announced the establishment of an FM band effective January 1, 1941, consisting of forty 200&nbsp;kHz-wide channels on a band from 42-50&nbsp;MHz, with the first five channels reserved for educational stations. Existing Apex stations were notified that they would not be allowed to operate after January 1, 1941 unless they converted to FM.\n\nAlthough there was interest in the new FM band by station owners, construction restrictions that went into place during WWII limited the growth of the new service. Following the end of WWII, the FCC moved to standardize its frequency allocations. One area of concern was the effects of [[Tropospheric propagation|tropospheric]] and [[Sporadic E propagation]], which at times reflected station signals over great distances, causing mutual interference. A particularly controversial proposal, spearheaded by RCA, was that the FM band needed to be shifted to higher frequencies to avoid this problem. This reassignment was fiercely opposed as unneeded by Armstrong, but he lost. The FCC made its decision final on June 27, 1945.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/298622331|title=Device to make FM Radios Work Under FCC Ruling|last=AP|first=|date=June 27, 1945|work=The Miami News|access-date=2017-08-14|at=6-A|language=en|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> It allocated 100 FM channels from 88\u2013108&nbsp;MHz, and assigned the former FM band to 'non government fixed and mobile' (42\u201344&nbsp;MHz), and [[Channel 1 (North American TV)|television channel 1]] (44\u201350&nbsp;MHz), now sidestepping the interference concerns.<ref name=\":0\" /> A period of allowing existing FM stations to broadcast on both low and high bands ended at midnight on January 8, 1949, at which time any low band transmitters were shut down, making obsolete 395,000<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/93688720|title=395,000 FM Radio Sets Must Be Replaced|last=INS|first=|date=June 27, 1945|work=Journal Gazette|access-date=2017-08-14|page=6|language=en|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> receivers that had already been purchased by the public for the original band.

The change was thought to have been favored by AT&T, as the elimination of FM relaying stations would require radio stations to lease wired links from that company. Particularly galling was the FCC assignment of TV channel 1 to the 44-50&nbsp;MHz segment of the old FM band.  Channel 1 was later deleted, since periodic [[radio propagation]] would make local TV signals unviewable.\n\nAlthough the FM band shift was an economic setback, there was reason for optimism. A book published in 1946 by Charles A. Siepmann heralded FM stations as \"Radio's Second Chance\".<ref>''Radio's Second Chance'' by Charles A. Siepmann, 1946, pages 239-253.</ref> In late 1945, Armstrong contracted with John Orr Young, founding member of the public relations firm [[Young & Rubicam]], to conduct a national campaign promoting FM broadcasting, especially by educational institutions. Article placements promoting both Armstrong personally and FM were made with general circulation publications including ''[[The Nation]]'', ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'', and ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''.<ref>[https://scholarworks.rit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4076&context=theses \"A Case study of Edwin Howard Armstrong's public relations campaign for FM\"] (thesis) by Jessica Francis, December 14, 2012, pages 16, 19.</ref>\n\nIn 1940, RCA offered Armstrong $1,000,000 for a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use his FM patents. He refused this offer, because he felt this would be unfair to the other licensed companies, which had to pay 2% royalties on their sales. Over time this impasse with RCA dominated Armstrong's life. RCA countered by conducting its own FM research, eventually developing what it claimed was a non-infringing FM system. The corporation encouraged other companies to stop paying royalties to Armstrong. Outraged by this, in 1948 Armstrong filed suit against RCA and the National Broadcasting Company, accusing them of patent infringement and that they had \"deliberately set out to oppose and impair the value\" of his invention, for which he requested treble damages. Although he was confident that this suit would be successful and result in a major monetary award, the protracted legal maneuvering that followed eventually began to impair his finances, especially after his primary patents expired in late 1950.<ref>Lewis (1991), pages 247-278, 300-328.</ref>\n\n==FM Doppler radar==\n\nDuring World War II, Armstrong turned his attention to investigations of continuous wave FM [[Doppler radar]] funded by government contracts.<ref>[https://blogs.cul.columbia.edu/armstrongpapers/tag/robert-e-hull/ \"Major Armstrong: Scientist, Technologist, Philosopher: Radar\"], by Jennifer Comins, July 22, 2010.

Although the War ended before this technology could be applied, it subsequently became the method of choice. The first clear test of its utility in extremely long-range target detection was carried out on January 10, 1946, when the Army Signal Corps' [[Project Diana]] successfully reflected radar waves off the moon using a transmitter and receiver designed by Armstrong.<ref>\u201cHow Diana touched the moon.\u201d Clark T.

In 2014 Eli Global made its first insurance acquisition when it purchased a burial-policy insurer based in Alabama. Lindberg wished to loan the insurer's assets to other businesses he owned, but the number of the company's assets he could invest in affiliated enterprises was restricted by Alabama state laws.

He left briefly in the 1970s to serve as a religious advisor to [[RT\u00c9]] in [[Dublin]] in the Republic of Ireland but spent the majority of his career in Derry.<ref name=\"IT obit\" />\n\n== Bloody Sunday (1972) ==\nDuring his time in Derry, he took part in the [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association|civil rights]] marches; he had first-hand experience of the [[Battle of the Bogside]] in 1969, the early years of [[the Troubles]], [[Internment in Northern Ireland|internment]], and the events of [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]], in which British soldiers fired on unarmed protesters on 30 January 1972, killing 14 people. Daly became a public figure after he was witnessed using a blood-stained handkerchief as a [[white flag]] in an attempt to escort 17-year-old Jackie Duddy, a wounded protester, to safety. Duddy died of his injuries soon after and Daly administered the [[last rites]]; he later described the events as \"a young fella who was posing no threat to anybody being shot dead unjustifiably\".<ref name=\"torygraph\"/> Duddy's family gave Daly a photograph of Jackie, which Daly always kept on his desk. He also gave an interview for the [[BBC]] in which he insisted, contrary to official reports, that the protesters were unarmed. He testified as such to the [[Widgery Tribunal]], though he also testified that he had seen a man with a gun on the day, to the anger of some of those involved; the Widgery Report largely exonerated the British Army, perpetuating the controversy.<ref name=\"beeb obit\" /> Years later, Daly opined that the events of Bloody Sunday were a significant catalyst to the violence in Northern Ireland, and that the shootings served to greatly increase recruitment to the IRA.<ref name=\"NYT death\" />\n\nThe controversy over Bloody Sunday lasted for decades; Daly believed the shootings provided a catalyst for the IRA's increase in violence through the 1970s and beyond. Daly's actions were captured on camera by the news media and broadcast around the world, which gave him a greatly increased profile. Prior to Bloody Sunday, Daly was sympathetic to the [[Irish Republican Army (1922\u201369)|\"old\" IRA]], of which his father was a member, but the events of Bloody Sunday left him of the opinion that \"violence is completely unacceptable as a means to a political end\", which led to a tension with the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] throughout his career.<ref name=\"IT obit\" /><ref name=\"torygraph\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/08/bloody-sunday-bishop-edward-daly-who-famously-raised-blood-soake/|title=Edward Daly, Peace-Seeking Bishop in Northern Ireland\u2019s \u2018Troubles,\u2019 Dies at 82|date=8 August 2016|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=10 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Bishop of Derry (1974\u201393) ==\nIn 1973, Daly worked with [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann|RT\u00c9]] in [[Dublin]] as a religious adviser for several months. He appeared on numerous television programmes and contributed to many television documentaries on religious and Northern Ireland affairs. He was appointed [[Bishop of Derry]] in 1974\u2014at 40, he was the youngest bishop in Ireland.<ref name=\"beeb obit\" /> His tenure was marked by conflict with the IRA over that organisation's use of violence to advance its political cause of a [[united Ireland]]; Daly and IRA spokesmen repeatedly exchanged words via the local press. The Catholic bishops of Ireland discussed the possibility of excommunicating IRA members several times during Daly's tenure, often in the aftermath of a particularly bloody attack, though no decision was ever reached. Daly was always reluctant to excommunicate and used the motto \"better to communicate than excommunicate\", for which he was severely criticised by the British tabloid press,<ref name=\"IT obit\" /> but he was outspoken in his opposition to violence by both sides. He introduced a ban on paramilitary trappings at Catholic funerals and in 1976 organised a protest march through Derry city centre\u2014a response to an increase in sectarian murders\u2014which was joined by almost all the clergy in the city and led by Daly and his Protestant counterpart, an event which was unprecedented in the city's history.<ref name=\"beeb obit\" />\n\nThroughout his career and particularly his tenure as Bishop of Derry, Daly took a keen interest in the criminal justice system, seeking to attend to the needs of prisoners, [[internment|internees]], and victims of miscarriages of justice including the [[Birmingham Six]] (who were wrongly convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the 1974 [[Birmingham pub bombings]], and whose convictions were quashed in 1991).<ref name=\"torygraph\" /> Along with the Catholic [[primate of all Ireland]], [[Tom\u00e1s \u00d3 Fiaich]], Daly lobbied the British government in 1977 against its decision to revoke [[Special Category Status]] ([[political prisoner]] status) from IRA prisoners and subsequently their treatment as criminals. When the issue culminated in [[1981 Irish hunger strike|a hunger strike in 1981]] which resulted in the deaths of ten prisoners at [[HM Prison Maze]], he lobbied the [[European Commission on Human Rights]] to intervene.<ref name=\"grauniad obit\" />\n\nIn 1979, Daly was involved in planning a visit by [[Pope John Paul II]] to [[Armagh]], scheduled for September and which had won the approval of the British government, but the visit was cancelled in the wake of the IRA's assassination of [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]] and the [[Warrenpoint ambush]] (in which 18 British soldiers were killed), both on 27 August 1979. The visit was transferred to [[Drogheda]], in the same archdiocese but across the border in the Republic, where the pope appealed to the IRA to give up armed resistance.<ref name=\"IT obit\" />\n\nTension between Daly and the IRA reached its peak in 1983 when Daly banned [[requiem mass]] with the body present, and forbade military trappings, at funerals of paramilitaries. The ban came after Daly negotiated an agreement with the IRA that there be no guns present at funerals, which the IRA breached when several of its members fired shots over a coffin during a ceremony.<ref name=\"grauniad obit\" /><ref name=\"beeb obit\" /><ref name=\"NYT death\" />\n\nDaly was deeply affected by the IRA's \"[[Proxy bomb#October 1990 proxy bombings|proxy bombings]]\" in October 1990, in which IRA members forced civilians to drive car bombs to their targets, with the result that the driver was killed in the explosion along with anybody in close proximity to the van. Daly described the bombings as having \"crossed a new threshold of evil\", and believed that while they may claim to be Catholics, \"works proclaim clearly that they follow Satan\".<ref name=\"IT obit\" /><ref name=\"NYT death\" />\n\nWhile Daly was always willing to attend to the religious needs of IRA members, he refused to engage in any formal meeting until 1992, when [[John Hume]]\u2014the leader of Northern Ireland's [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]], who was attempting to negotiate a truce with the IRA, and with whom Daly was close friends\u2014convinced him to meet [[Gerry Adams]] and [[Martin McGuinness]]. Daly later remarked that he shared much common ground with the two, particularly McGuinness, with whom he only substantially disagreed on the morality of using violence to achieve political aims.<ref name=\"grauniad obit\" />\n\nDespite the tension between Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland, Daly maintained a personal friendship with [[James Mehaffey]], the Anglican (Protestant) [[Bishop of Derry and Raphoe]] from the latter's appointment in 1980, which was described after Daly's death as \"a powerful message of harmony and bridge-building\".<ref name=\"torygraph\" /> Among many joint projects Daly and Mehaffey co-founded two charities with the intent to promote community healing in Derry after years of sectarian violence.<ref name=\"beeb obit\" /> He retired from his position as [[Bishop of Derry]] in October 1993, after suffering a [[stroke]]. He was succeeded by Bishop [[S\u00e9amus Hegarty]] and in retirement took up the post of chaplain at Foyle Hospice.<ref name=\"IT obit\" />\n\n==Later life==\nDaly published an autobiography, ''Mister, Are you a Priest?'', in 2000. This he followed with a second memoir, ''A Troubled See: Memoirs of a Derry Bishop'', published in 2011.<ref name=\"IT obit\" /> He was also the author of ''Do Not Let Your Hearts Be Troubled'', co-author of ''The Clergy of the Diocese of Derry: an Index'' and contributed an essay to ''A History of the Diocese of Derry''. In ''A Troubled See'', Daly discussed ending the [[Clerical celibacy (Catholic Church)|compulsory celibacy]] for Roman Catholic priests; his view was that allowing priests to marry could alleviate the church's problems recruiting new priests. He was distressed that, despite a shortage of priests, priests were forced to resign or otherwise good candidates were rejected because of the celibacy rule; he felt that there was \"certainly an important and enduring place for celibate priesthood. But I believe that there should also be a place in the modern Catholic Church for married priesthood and for men who do not wish to commit themselves to celibacy\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Ex-bishop calls for end to celibacy|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/exbishop-calls-for-end-to-celibacy-28658074.html|accessdate=30 March 2015|work=[[Belfast Telegraph]]|date=13 September 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"cns\">{{cite news|title=Irish bishop suggests another look at celibacy|url=https://cnsblog.wordpress.com/2011/09/15/irish-bishop-suggests-another-look-at-celibacy/|accessdate=29 March 2015|work=[[Catholic News Service]]|date=15 September 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"beeb celibacy\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-14894806|title=Bishop Daly calls for an end to clerical celibacy|date=13 September 2011|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=10 August 2016}}</ref> The [[Association of Catholic Priests]] publicly supported his stance.<ref name=irishtimes14Sept2011>{{cite news|last1=McGarry|first1=Patsy|title=Priest group backs Daly's calls for end to celibacy|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/priest-group-backs-daly-s-calls-for-end-to-celibacy-1.598463|accessdate=30 March 2015|work=[[Irish Times]]|date=14 September 2011}}</ref> Daly later clarified that he valued his own vow of celibacy, and that it enhanced his own life as a priest.

The inquiry superseded the Widgery Report, which had been accused of whitewashing since its publication, and Daly welcomed the new inquiry, saying he was \"full of hope\" for it in 2000.

The Saville Report upheld Daly's evidence that the marchers had been unarmed. Lord Saville believed that armed men were likely present, but did nothing that would prompt the army to open fire, and that many of the soldiers involved had lied in their accounts of their actions, though the shootings were not premeditated. He also found that the soldiers had fired without warning, had fired on people who were fleeing or rushing to help the wounded, and that none of those injured or killed posed a threat, nor had they done anything to give the soldiers cause to fire at them.

He left briefly in the 1970s to serve as a religious advisor to [[RT\u00c9]] in [[Dublin]] in the Republic of Ireland but spent the majority of his career in Derry.<ref name=\"IT obit\" />\n\n== Bloody Sunday (1972) ==\nDuring his time in Derry, he took part in the [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association|civil rights]] marches; he had first-hand experience of the [[Battle of the Bogside]] in 1969, the early years of [[the Troubles]], [[Internment in Northern Ireland|internment]], and the events of [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]], in which British soldiers fired on unarmed protesters on 30 January 1972, killing 14 people. Daly became a public figure after he was witnessed using a blood-stained handkerchief as a [[white flag]] in an attempt to escort 17-year-old Jackie Duddy, a wounded protester, to safety. Duddy died of his injuries soon after and Daly administered the [[last rites]]; he later described the events as \"a young fella who was posing no threat to anybody being shot dead unjustifiably\".<ref name=\"torygraph\"/> Duddy's family gave Daly a photograph of Jackie, which Daly always kept on his desk. He also gave an interview for the [[BBC]] in which he insisted, contrary to official reports, that the protesters were unarmed. He testified as such to the [[Widgery Tribunal]], though he also testified that he had seen a man with a gun on the day, to the anger of some of those involved; the Widgery Report largely exonerated the British Army, perpetuating the controversy.<ref name=\"beeb obit\" /> Years later, Daly opined that the events of Bloody Sunday were a significant catalyst to the violence in Northern Ireland, and that the shootings served to greatly increase recruitment to the IRA.<ref name=\"NYT death\" />\n\nThe controversy over Bloody Sunday lasted for decades; Daly believed the shootings provided a catalyst for the IRA's increase in violence through the 1970s and beyond. Daly's actions were captured on camera by the news media and broadcast around the world, which gave him a greatly increased profile. Prior to Bloody Sunday, Daly was sympathetic to the [[Irish Republican Army (1922\u201369)|\"old\" IRA]], of which his father was a member, but the events of Bloody Sunday left him of the opinion that \"violence is completely unacceptable as a means to a political end\", which led to a tension with the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] throughout his career.<ref name=\"IT obit\" /><ref name=\"torygraph\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/08/bloody-sunday-bishop-edward-daly-who-famously-raised-blood-soake/|title=Edward Daly, Peace-Seeking Bishop in Northern Ireland\u2019s \u2018Troubles,\u2019 Dies at 82|date=8 August 2016|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=10 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Bishop of Derry (1974\u201393) ==\nIn 1973, Daly worked with [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann|RT\u00c9]] in [[Dublin]] as a religious adviser for several months. He appeared on numerous television programmes and contributed to many television documentaries on religious and Northern Ireland affairs. He was appointed [[Bishop of Derry]] in 1974\u2014at 40, he was the youngest bishop in Ireland.<ref name=\"beeb obit\" /> His tenure was marked by conflict with the IRA over that organisation's use of violence to advance its political cause of a [[united Ireland]]; Daly and IRA spokesmen repeatedly exchanged words via the local press. The Catholic bishops of Ireland discussed the possibility of excommunicating IRA members several times during Daly's tenure, often in the aftermath of a particularly bloody attack, though no decision was ever reached. Daly was always reluctant to excommunicate and used the motto \"better to communicate than excommunicate\", for which he was severely criticised by the British tabloid press,<ref name=\"IT obit\" /> but he was outspoken in his opposition to violence by both sides. He introduced a ban on paramilitary trappings at Catholic funerals and in 1976 organised a protest march through Derry city centre\u2014a response to an increase in sectarian murders\u2014which was joined by almost all the clergy in the city and led by Daly and his Protestant counterpart, an event which was unprecedented in the city's history.<ref name=\"beeb obit\" />\n\nThroughout his career and particularly his tenure as Bishop of Derry, Daly took a keen interest in the criminal justice system, seeking to attend to the needs of prisoners, [[internment|internees]], and victims of miscarriages of justice including the [[Birmingham Six]] (who were wrongly convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the 1974 [[Birmingham pub bombings]], and whose convictions were quashed in 1991).<ref name=\"torygraph\" /> Along with the Catholic [[primate of all Ireland]], [[Tom\u00e1s \u00d3 Fiaich]], Daly lobbied the British government in 1977 against its decision to revoke [[Special Category Status]] ([[political prisoner]] status) from IRA prisoners and subsequently their treatment as criminals. When the issue culminated in [[1981 Irish hunger strike|a hunger strike in 1981]] which resulted in the deaths of ten prisoners at [[HM Prison Maze]], he lobbied the [[European Commission on Human Rights]] to intervene.<ref name=\"grauniad obit\" />\n\nIn 1979, Daly was involved in planning a visit by [[Pope John Paul II]] to [[Armagh]], scheduled for September and which had won the approval of the British government, but the visit was cancelled in the wake of the IRA's assassination of [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]] and the [[Warrenpoint ambush]] (in which 18 British soldiers were killed), both on 27 August 1979. The visit was transferred to [[Drogheda]], in the same archdiocese but across the border in the Republic, where the pope appealed to the IRA to give up armed resistance.<ref name=\"IT obit\" />\n\nTension between Daly and the IRA reached its peak in 1983 when Daly banned [[requiem mass]] with the body present, and forbade military trappings, at funerals of paramilitaries. The ban came after Daly negotiated an agreement with the IRA that there be no guns present at funerals, which the IRA breached when several of its members fired shots over a coffin during a ceremony.<ref name=\"grauniad obit\" /><ref name=\"beeb obit\" /><ref name=\"NYT death\" />\n\nDaly was deeply affected by the IRA's \"[[Proxy bomb#October 1990 proxy bombings|proxy bombings]]\" in October 1990, in which IRA members forced civilians to drive car bombs to their targets, with the result that the driver was killed in the explosion along with anybody in close proximity to the van. Daly described the bombings as having \"crossed a new threshold of evil\", and believed that while they may claim to be Catholics, \"works proclaim clearly that they follow Satan\".<ref name=\"IT obit\" /><ref name=\"NYT death\" />\n\nWhile Daly was always willing to attend to the religious needs of IRA members, he refused to engage in any formal meeting until 1992, when [[John Hume]]\u2014the leader of Northern Ireland's [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]], who was attempting to negotiate a truce with the IRA, and with whom Daly was close friends\u2014convinced him to meet [[Gerry Adams]] and [[Martin McGuinness]]. Daly later remarked that he shared much common ground with the two, particularly McGuinness, with whom he only substantially disagreed on the morality of using violence to achieve political aims.<ref name=\"grauniad obit\" />\n\nDespite the tension between Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland, Daly maintained a personal friendship with [[James Mehaffey]], the Anglican (Protestant) [[Bishop of Derry and Raphoe]] from the latter's appointment in 1980, which was described after Daly's death as \"a powerful message of harmony and bridge-building\".<ref name=\"torygraph\" /> Among many joint projects Daly and Mehaffey co-founded two charities with the intent to promote community healing in Derry after years of sectarian violence.<ref name=\"beeb obit\" /> He retired from his position as [[Bishop of Derry]] in October 1993, after suffering a [[stroke]]. He was succeeded by Bishop [[S\u00e9amus Hegarty]] and in retirement took up the post of chaplain at Foyle Hospice.<ref name=\"IT obit\" />\n\n==Later life==\nDaly published an autobiography, ''Mister, Are you a Priest?'', in 2000. This he followed with a second memoir, ''A Troubled See: Memoirs of a Derry Bishop'', published in 2011.<ref name=\"IT obit\" /> He was also the author of ''Do Not Let Your Hearts Be Troubled'', co-author of ''The Clergy of the Diocese of Derry: an Index'' and contributed an essay to ''A History of the Diocese of Derry''. In ''A Troubled See'', Daly discussed ending the [[Clerical celibacy (Catholic Church)|compulsory celibacy]] for Roman Catholic priests; his view was that allowing priests to marry could alleviate the church's problems recruiting new priests. He was distressed that, despite a shortage of priests, priests were forced to resign or otherwise good candidates were rejected because of the celibacy rule; he felt that there was \"certainly an important and enduring place for celibate priesthood. But I believe that there should also be a place in the modern Catholic Church for married priesthood and for men who do not wish to commit themselves to celibacy\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Ex-bishop calls for end to celibacy|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/exbishop-calls-for-end-to-celibacy-28658074.html|accessdate=30 March 2015|work=[[Belfast Telegraph]]|date=13 September 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"cns\">{{cite news|title=Irish bishop suggests another look at celibacy|url=https://cnsblog.wordpress.com/2011/09/15/irish-bishop-suggests-another-look-at-celibacy/|accessdate=29 March 2015|work=[[Catholic News Service]]|date=15 September 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"beeb celibacy\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-14894806|title=Bishop Daly calls for an end to clerical celibacy|date=13 September 2011|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=10 August 2016}}</ref> The [[Association of Catholic Priests]] publicly supported his stance.<ref name=irishtimes14Sept2011>{{cite news|last1=McGarry|first1=Patsy|title=Priest group backs Daly's calls for end to celibacy|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/priest-group-backs-daly-s-calls-for-end-to-celibacy-1.598463|accessdate=30 March 2015|work=[[Irish Times]]|date=14 September 2011}}</ref> Daly later clarified that he valued his own vow of celibacy, and that it enhanced his own life as a priest.

Lord Saville believed that armed men were likely present, but did nothing that would prompt the army to open fire, and that many of the soldiers involved had lied in their accounts of their actions, though the shootings were not premeditated. He also found that the soldiers had fired without warning, had fired on people who were fleeing or rushing to help the wounded, and that none of those injured or killed posed a threat, nor had they done anything to give the soldiers cause to fire at them.
