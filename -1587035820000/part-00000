The film was produced by [[Sol C.

''High Society'''s screenplay was written by [[John Patrick (dramatist)|John Patrick]] and involves a successful popular jazz musician (Crosby) who tries to win back the affections of his ex-wife (Kelly), who is preparing to marry another man. The cast also features [[Celeste Holm]], [[John Lund (actor)|John Lund]] and [[Louis Calhern]], in his final film, with a musical contribution by [[Louis Armstrong]].\n\n''High Society'' was Kelly's last film appearance, before she became [[List of Mon\u00e9gasque consorts|Princess consort of Monaco]].\n\n==Plot==\nSuccessful jazz musician C.K.

Tracy begins an elaborate charade as a private means of revenge, introducing her Uncle Willy as her proper father Seth Lord and the latter as her \"wicked\" Uncle Willy.\n\nConnor falls in love with Tracy, who must choose among three very different men in a course of self-discovery. After becoming tipsy at a party on the eve of her wedding and going off with Connor for a romantic swim, Tracy decides to go through with it until Kittredge takes umbrage. While in the process of telling her guests that the wedding is off, Tracy is surprised by a proposal from Dexter to take the groom's place.

It has been said{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} that one of the main reasons star Sinatra was drawn to the film was a mock-tipsy duet with his boyhood idol Crosby on \"Well, Did You Evah!\", a song from an earlier Porter show, ''[[DuBarry Was a Lady]]'' (1939), re-adapted and added at the last minute when it was noted that the two singers did not have a duet to perform in the film.\n\nThe title of the song \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\" gained new significance a half-century later as the title of a [[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?|global game show franchise]]. \"I Love You, Samantha\" has also become a jazz favorite for improvisations.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nWhen Bing Crosby sang \"Now You Has Jazz\", he uttered the Porter lyric \"rock and roll\", and it very well might have been the first time that phrase was uttered on film. It would have been ironic coming from Crosby since rock and roll would very soon eclipse the jazz and swing of Crosby, Sinatra, and Armstrong. The first rock and roll film came out the following year.\n\n==Release==\n\n===Critical reception===\nOpening on July 17, 1956, ''High Society'' garnered mixed reviews, often being compared as a lesser offering to ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|The Philadelphia Story]]'', a previous adaptation in 1940 of the same play starring [[Cary Grant]] in the Crosby part, [[Katharine Hepburn]] in the Kelly role, and [[James Stewart]] in an [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Oscar]]-winning turn as the reporter played in the remake by Sinatra. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' noted: \"''High Society'' should spell high finance business all over. It's a solid entertainment every minute of its footage. Fortified with a strong Cole Porter score, film is a pleasant romp for cast toppers Bing Crosby, Grace Kelly and Frank Sinatra who, tactfully, get alphabetical top billing. Their impact is almost equally consistent. Although Sinatra has the top pop tune opportunities, the Crooner makes his specialties stand up and out on showmanship and delivery, and Miss Kelly impresses as the femme lead with pleasantly comedienne overtones. This is perhaps her most relaxed performance ...\"<ref>{{cite journal|title=Variety|date=July 18, 1956}}</ref>\n\n[[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described it as \"flimsy as a gossip-columnist's word\", missing \"the snap and the crackle that its un-musical predecessor had.\"<ref>{{cite web| title= No ''Philadelphia Story'', This: 'High Society' Lacks Hepburn Sparkle | url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9903E2DD113FE03BBC4852DFBE66838D649EDE|work= The New York Times | date= August 10, 1956| author= [[Bosley Crowther]] | accessdate=August 5, 2011}}</ref> According to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', in spite of its \"Who's Who cast\" the film is \"simply not top-drawer\"; a \"good deal of the screenplay seems as dated today as the idle rich ...

It was one of the [[1956 in film#Top grossing films (U.S.)|10 highest grossing films of 1956]] in the US and Canada earning $5,602,000, and $2,656,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $1,148,000.<ref name=\"Mannix\"/>\n\n==Awards & Nominations==\n''High Society'' received two [[Academy Award]] nominations, and nearly received a third. The film was initially nominated in the 1956 Academy Awards for [[Academy Award for Best Story|Best Motion Picture Story]], even though it was based on the 1940 film ''The Philadelphia Story'' and thus was not eligible in that category. Moreover, the nominated writers, [[Elwood Ullman]] and [[Edward Bernds]], had written not this film, but a [[High Society (1955 film)|1955 Bowery Boys film]] also titled ''High Society''.\n\nAccording to the book ''Inside Oscar'', [[Steve Broidy]], president of [[The Bowery Boys]] home studio [[Monogram Pictures|Allied Artists]], told the press, \"This just proves what we've known all along&nbsp;\u2013 that the Bowery Boys series couldn't have lasted this long if not for the fine writers.\" The joking in the press aside, Ullman and Bernds sent a [[telegram]] to the Academy Award Board of Governors, acknowledging the error and requesting that their names be removed from the final ballot.<ref name=\"InsideOscar\">{{cite book|last=Wiley|first=Mason|title=Inside Oscar|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York|isbn=0-345-40053-4|pages=273\u2013274}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It has been said{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} that one of the main reasons star Sinatra was drawn to the film was a mock-tipsy duet with his boyhood idol Crosby on \"Well, Did You Evah!\", a song from an earlier Porter show, ''[[DuBarry Was a Lady]]'' (1939), re-adapted and added at the last minute when it was noted that the two singers did not have a duet to perform in the film.\n\nThe title of the song \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\" gained new significance a half-century later as the title of a [[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?|global game show franchise]]. \"I Love You, Samantha\" has also become a jazz favorite for improvisations.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nWhen Bing Crosby sang \"Now You Has Jazz\", he uttered the Porter lyric \"rock and roll\", and it very well might have been the first time that phrase was uttered on film. It would have been ironic coming from Crosby since rock and roll would very soon eclipse the jazz and swing of Crosby, Sinatra, and Armstrong. The first rock and roll film came out the following year.\n\n==Release==\n\n===Critical reception===\nOpening on July 17, 1956, ''High Society'' garnered mixed reviews, often being compared as a lesser offering to ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|The Philadelphia Story]]'', a previous adaptation in 1940 of the same play starring [[Cary Grant]] in the Crosby part, [[Katharine Hepburn]] in the Kelly role, and [[James Stewart]] in an [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Oscar]]-winning turn as the reporter played in the remake by Sinatra. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' noted: \"''High Society'' should spell high finance business all over. It's a solid entertainment every minute of its footage. Fortified with a strong Cole Porter score, film is a pleasant romp for cast toppers Bing Crosby, Grace Kelly and Frank Sinatra who, tactfully, get alphabetical top billing. Their impact is almost equally consistent. Although Sinatra has the top pop tune opportunities, the Crooner makes his specialties stand up and out on showmanship and delivery, and Miss Kelly impresses as the femme lead with pleasantly comedienne overtones. This is perhaps her most relaxed performance ...\"<ref>{{cite journal|title=Variety|date=July 18, 1956}}</ref>\n\n[[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described it as \"flimsy as a gossip-columnist's word\", missing \"the snap and the crackle that its un-musical predecessor had.\"<ref>{{cite web| title= No ''Philadelphia Story'', This: 'High Society' Lacks Hepburn Sparkle | url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9903E2DD113FE03BBC4852DFBE66838D649EDE|work= The New York Times | date= August 10, 1956| author= [[Bosley Crowther]] | accessdate=August 5, 2011}}</ref> According to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', in spite of its \"Who's Who cast\" the film is \"simply not top-drawer\"; a \"good deal of the screenplay seems as dated today as the idle rich ... [Kelly] lacks the gawky animal energy that Katharine Hepburn brought to the 1939 play and the 1941 movie, [Crosby] saunters through the part rather sleepily, without much of the old Bing zing [, and] Sinatra plays the reporter like a dead-end kid with a typewriter.\"<ref name=\"time1956\"/>\n\n===Box office===\nAt the North American box office, ''High Society'' was a success. It was one of the [[1956 in film#Top grossing films (U.S.)|10 highest grossing films of 1956]] in the US and Canada earning $5,602,000, and $2,656,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $1,148,000.<ref name=\"Mannix\"/>\n\n==Awards & Nominations==\n''High Society'' received two [[Academy Award]] nominations, and nearly received a third. The film was initially nominated in the 1956 Academy Awards for [[Academy Award for Best Story|Best Motion Picture Story]], even though it was based on the 1940 film ''The Philadelphia Story'' and thus was not eligible in that category. Moreover, the nominated writers, [[Elwood Ullman]] and [[Edward Bernds]], had written not this film, but a [[High Society (1955 film)|1955 Bowery Boys film]] also titled ''High Society''.\n\nAccording to the book ''Inside Oscar'', [[Steve Broidy]], president of [[The Bowery Boys]] home studio [[Monogram Pictures|Allied Artists]], told the press, \"This just proves what we've known all along&nbsp;\u2013 that the Bowery Boys series couldn't have lasted this long if not for the fine writers.\" The joking in the press aside, Ullman and Bernds sent a [[telegram]] to the Academy Award Board of Governors, acknowledging the error and requesting that their names be removed from the final ballot.<ref name=\"InsideOscar\">{{cite book|last=Wiley|first=Mason|title=Inside Oscar|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York|isbn=0-345-40053-4|pages=273\u2013274}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Rather than being disbanded, the surplus units were amalgamated in pairs. This resulted in the renumbering and renaming of the entire cavalry line.

Its badge consisted of crossed silver lances bearing pennons, with a crown at the intersection above \"XX\" and a scroll below. In 1937, the 20th Lancers became the training regiment of the [[3rd Cavalry (India)|3rd Indian Cavalry Group]] at [[Lucknow]].

Rather than being disbanded, the surplus units were amalgamated in pairs. This resulted in the renumbering and renaming of the entire cavalry line. The 20th Lancers was formed in 1922, after amalgamation of the [[14th Murray's Jat Lancers]] and the [[15th Lancers (Cureton's Multanis)]] on 21 September 1920, at [[Sialkot]].\n\nThe 14th Murray's Jat Lancers was originally raised at [[Aligarh]] as the Jat Horse Yeomanry in 1857, during the [[Indian Mutiny]], and was composed entirely of Hindu [[Jat]]s.<ref name=\"Gaylor 1991\"/> The 15th Lancers (Cureton's Multanis) was formed at [[Lahore]] in 1858 from [[Multani (caste)|Multani]] [[Pathans]], and had originally been raised in 1857 as The Multani Regiment of Cavalry.<ref name=\"Gaylor 1991\"/><ref>Harris, RG, and Warner, C. (1979). ''Bengal Cavalry Regiments 1857\u20131914''. London: Osprey.</ref> The new 20th Lancers regiment formed by their amalgamation comprised one squadron each of Punjabi Muslims, [[Jat Sikhs]], and Hindu [[Jats]].\n\nThe uniform of the 20th Lancers was dark blue with scarlet facings. Its badge consisted of crossed silver lances bearing pennons, with a crown at the intersection above \"XX\" and a scroll below. In 1937, the 20th Lancers became the training regiment of the [[3rd Cavalry (India)|3rd Indian Cavalry Group]] at [[Lucknow]]. It was converted into a training centre in 1940, and transferred to India after [[Partition of India|Partition of India and Pakistan]].<ref name=\"Gaylor 1991\"/><ref>Sandhu, Maj Gen GS. (1981).

Upon formation, it was equipped with [[M24 Chaffee]] light tanks.<ref name=\"Nath2009\">{{cite book|last=Nath|first=Ashok|title=Izzat: Historical records and iconography of Indian cavalry regiments, 1750\u20132007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sGQeQwAACAAJ|year=2009|publisher=Centre for Armed Forces Historical Research, United Service Institution of India|isbn=978-81-902097-7-9|pages=731\u2013732}}</ref> The same year, the Indian Army also raised an armoured regiment, the [[20 Lancers (India)|20 Lancers]], as the successor of the pre-independence 20th Lancers.\n\nMajor Syed Azmat Ali Bokhari was given responsibility for raising the 20th Lancers for the Pakistan Army Armoured Corps. Major Bokhari also commanded a squadron of the regiment during the 1965 war against India, serving on the Sialkot front. The regiment's original badge was retained when it was re-raised in 1956, with the exception of the crown.{{Cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Operations==\nDuring the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]], the regiment, equipped with [[M36 tank destroyer|M36B2]] [[tank destroyer]]s, served under the [[15th Infantry Division (Pakistan)|15th Infantry Division]] in the [[Sialkot]] Sector. The regiment took part in the defence of the Sialkot Cantonment and Dallowali Railway Station, losing fifteen men. For its role in this action, the regiment was awarded the [[battle honour]] \"Sialkot 1965\".<ref name=\"Nath2009\"/><ref name=\"Sabre & Lance\">''The Sabre & Lance: Journal of the Pakistan Armoured Corps''.

The regiment held up the invading Indian divisions for two weeks against repeated attacks, with the loss of sixteen men. The regiment was subsequently awarded the battle honour \"Shakargarh 1971\". [[Sawar Muhammad Hussain|Sowar Muhammad Hussain]] was awarded a posthumous [[Nishan-i-Haider]] for outstanding gallantry, the only occasion on which this award was won by the Pakistan Armoured Corps.<ref name=\"Nath2009\"/><ref name=\"Sabre & Lance\"/>\n\n==Affiliations & Alliances==\n{{flag icon|Pakistan}} The [[Punjab Regiment (Pakistan)|Punjab Regiment]]\n\nIn 1990, the 20th Lancers was given permission to add the suffix ''Haidri'' to its title. It was also affiliated with the [[Punjab Regiment (Pakistan)|Punjab Regiment]], as a mark of recognition of the battlefield camaraderie between the 13th Battalion, Punjab Regiment and the 20th Lancers in Shakargarh in 1971.
