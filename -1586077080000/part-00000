The first step towards Indianization was taken in the same year with 6% of Indian shareholding of the company. ITC also became the first Indian company to foray into consumer research during this time. During 1960's, technology was given more focus with setting up of cigarette machinery and filter-rod manufacturing facilities aimed at achieving self-sufficiency in cigarette-making.\n\nAjit Narain Haskar became the company's first Indian chairman in 1969 and this was crucial in building up the Indian management for the company. As the company's ownership progressively Indianised, under Haskar's leadership, the name of the company was changed from 'Imperial Tobacco Company of India Limited' to 'India Tobacco Company Limited' in 1970. ITC also became the first company in India to start phased Indianisation of capital and the Indian shareholding of ITC grew from 6% to 25%. ITC entered into brand sponsorship for various sporting events, starting from the 1971 Scissor's Cup. Innovative market campaigns and electronic data processing were started in the 1970s.\n\nIn 1973, ITC set up its integrated research center in Bangalore, aimed at diversification and venturing into newer businesses with research and development. With the unfolding diversification plans, the name of the company was changed to 'I.T.C. Limited' in 1974. The Indian shareholding grew further to 40% during this time. ITC entered into the hospitality sector with hotel business in 1975 with the acquisition renaming of ITC Welcomgroup Hotel Chola in Madras. ITC chose the hospitality sector for its potential to earn high levels of foreign exchange, create tourism infrastructure and generate large scale direct and indirect employment.\n\nThe shareholding went over 60% in 1976 and more hotels were started by the company in the following years. ITC Sangeet Research Academy was set up at Calcutta in 1977. In 1979, ITC entered the paperboards business by promoting ITC Bhadrachalam Paperboards Limited. J N Sapru took over as the company's chairman in 1983 and the international expansion started with the acquisition of Surya Nepal Private Limited in 1985. The year 1986 saw vigorous moves from the company with opening of an Indian restaurant was in the city of New York, acquisition and renaming of Vishvarama Hotels to ITC Hotels Limited, setting up of two new ventures \u2013 the ITC Classic Finance Limited and ITC Agro Tech Limited under its umbrella. ITC also entered into the edible oils industry with the launch of 'Sundrop' brand of cooking oils in 1988. Tribeni Tissues Limited was acquired in 1990. K L Chugh assumed the role of chairman in 1991 and ITC Global Holding Private limited was started as an international trading company in Singapore in 1992. In 1994, all the hotels under the company were transferred into the listed subsidiary company ITC Hotels Limited. ITC, through the brand 'Wills', sponsored the 1996 Cricket World Cup.\n\n[[Yogesh Chander Deveshwar|Y.C. Deveshwar]] took over as the company's chairman in 1996 and the corporate governance structure was re-crafted to support effective management of multiple businesses. ITC exited from edible oils business and financial services; sold the ITC Classic Finance Limited to ICICI Limited and handled the 'Sundrop' business to ConAgra Foods Limited in 1998. In the year 2000, an innovative initiative for farmers called 'e-Choupal' was started in Madhya Pradesh in 2000. The same year witnessed the launch of ITC's 'Wills Sport' range of casual wear with first retail outlet in New Delhi and ITC's entry into stationery products and gifting business introducing the 'Expressions' range of greeting cards and 'Classmate' notebooks. A wholly owned information technology subsidiary, ITC Infotech India Limited was also started in 2000 and the ITC Bhadrachalam Paperboards Limited was merged into ITC Limited. The name of the company was changed to 'ITC Limited' omitting the dots and adapting the strategy 'No stops for ITC' in 2001. Employee stock option scheme was introduced for the first time and a web portal for the company was launched. Subsidiaries for ITC Infotech were set up at United Kingdom and USA.\n\n==Products and brands==\n===Cigarettes===\nITC Ltd sells 81% of the Cigarettes, Bidi in Asia, where 275 million people use tobacco products and the total cigarette market is worth close to $11 billion (around Rs.&nbsp;757399.4<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.portal.euromonitor.com/portal/analysis/tab|title=Euromonitor International \u2013 Log in|website=www.portal.euromonitor.com|access-date=2018-03-10}}</ref> million).\n\nITC's major cigarette brands include [[Wills Navy Cut]], [[Gold Flake|Gold Flake Kings]], [[Gold Flake|Gold Flake Premium lights]], [[Gold Flake|Gold Flake Super Star]], Insignia, [[India Kings]], Classic (Verve, Menthol, Menthol Rush, Regular, Citric Twist, Ice Burst, Mild & Ultra Mild), [[555 cigarettes|555]], [[Silk Cut]], Scissors, [[Capstan (cigarette)|Capstan]], Berkeley, Bristol, Lucky Strike, Players, Flake and Duke & Royal.\n\n===Other businesses===\n* Foods: ITC's major food brands include Kitchens of India; [[Aashirvaad]], B natural,  Sunfeast, Candyman, Bingo! and Yippee!.

The first step towards Indianization was taken in the same year with 6% of Indian shareholding of the company. ITC also became the first Indian company to foray into consumer research during this time. During 1960's, technology was given more focus with setting up of cigarette machinery and filter-rod manufacturing facilities aimed at achieving self-sufficiency in cigarette-making.\n\nAjit Narain Haskar became the company's first Indian chairman in 1969 and this was crucial in building up the Indian management for the company. As the company's ownership progressively Indianised, under Haskar's leadership, the name of the company was changed from 'Imperial Tobacco Company of India Limited' to 'India Tobacco Company Limited' in 1970. ITC also became the first company in India to start phased Indianisation of capital and the Indian shareholding of ITC grew from 6% to 25%. ITC entered into brand sponsorship for various sporting events, starting from the 1971 Scissor's Cup. Innovative market campaigns and electronic data processing were started in the 1970s.\n\nIn 1973, ITC set up its integrated research center in Bangalore, aimed at diversification and venturing into newer businesses with research and development. With the unfolding diversification plans, the name of the company was changed to 'I.T.C. Limited' in 1974. The Indian shareholding grew further to 40% during this time. ITC entered into the hospitality sector with hotel business in 1975 with the acquisition renaming of ITC Welcomgroup Hotel Chola in Madras. ITC chose the hospitality sector for its potential to earn high levels of foreign exchange, create tourism infrastructure and generate large scale direct and indirect employment.\n\nThe shareholding went over 60% in 1976 and more hotels were started by the company in the following years. ITC Sangeet Research Academy was set up at Calcutta in 1977. In 1979, ITC entered the paperboards business by promoting ITC Bhadrachalam Paperboards Limited. J N Sapru took over as the company's chairman in 1983 and the international expansion started with the acquisition of Surya Nepal Private Limited in 1985. The year 1986 saw vigorous moves from the company with opening of an Indian restaurant was in the city of New York, acquisition and renaming of Vishvarama Hotels to ITC Hotels Limited, setting up of two new ventures - the ITC Classic Finance Limited and ITC Agro Tech Limited under its umbrella. ITC also entered into the edible oils industry with the launch of 'Sundrop' brand of cooking oils in 1988. Tribeni Tissues Limited was acquired in 1990. K L Chugh assumed the role of chairman in 1991 and ITC Global Holding Private limited was started as an international trading company in Singapore in 1992. In 1994, all the hotels under the company were transferred into the listed subsidiary company ITC Hotels Limited. ITC, through the brand 'Wills', sponsored the 1996 Cricket World Cup.\n\n[[Yogesh Chander Deveshwar|Y.C. Deveshwar]] took over as the company's chairman in 1996 and the corporate governance structure was re-crafted to support effective management of multiple businesses. ITC exited from edible oils business and financial services; sold the ITC Classic Finance Limited to ICICI Limited and handled the 'Sundrop' business to ConAgra Foods Limited in 1998. In the year 2000, an innovative initiative for farmers called 'e-Choupal' was started in Madhya Pradesh in 2000. The same year witnessed the launch of ITC's 'Wills Sport' range of casual wear with first retail outlet in New Delhi and ITC's entry into stationery products and gifting business introducing the 'Expressions' range of greeting cards and 'Classmate' notebooks. A wholly owned information technology subsidiary, ITC Infotech India Limited was also started in 2000 and the ITC Bhadrachalam Paperboards Limited was merged into ITC Limited. The name of the company was changed to 'ITC Limited' omitting the dots and adapting the strategy 'No stops for ITC' in 2001. Employee stock option scheme was introduced for the first time and a web portal for the company was launched. Subsidiaries for ITC Infotech were set up at United Kingdom and USA.\n\n==Products and brands==\n===Cigarettes===\nITC Ltd sells 81% of the Cigarettes, Bidi in Asia, where 275 million people use tobacco products and the total cigarette market is worth close to $11 billion (around Rs.&nbsp;757399.4<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.portal.euromonitor.com/portal/analysis/tab|title=Euromonitor International - Log in|website=www.portal.euromonitor.com|access-date=2018-03-10}}</ref> million).\n\nITC's major cigarette brands include [[Wills Navy Cut]], [[Gold Flake|Gold Flake Kings]], [[Gold Flake|Gold Flake Premium lights]], [[Gold Flake|Gold Flake Super Star]], Insignia, [[India Kings]], Classic (Verve, Menthol, Menthol Rush, Regular, Citric Twist, Ice Burst, Mild & Ultra Mild), [[555 cigarettes|555]], [[Silk Cut]], Scissors, [[Capstan (cigarette)|Capstan]], Berkeley, Bristol, Lucky Strike, Players, Flake and Duke & Royal.\n\n===Other businesses===\n* Foods: ITC's major food brands include Kitchens of India; [[Aashirvaad]], B natural,  Sunfeast, Candyman, Bingo! and Yippee!.

From Pardon's becoming editor of ''Wisden'' in 1887, the editor was nearly always a CRA partner and the CRA was responsible for the editorial production of the ''Almanack'', until in 1965 it merged with the [[Press Association]] (PA).<ref>{{cite book | chapter=Preface to the 1966 Edition| first=Norman |last=Preston| title=Wisden Cricketers' Almanack |edition=1966|pages= vi\u2013vii|publisher=Sporting Handbooks Ltd}}</ref>\n\n''Wisden'' was acquired and published by [[Robert Maxwell]]'s publishing conglomerate, Macdonald, in the 1970s. Cricket fan [[John Paul Getty, Jr.|Sir John Paul Getty, Jr.]], bought the company, John Wisden & Co., in 1993<ref name=ft /> and in December 2008 it was sold to [[A&C Black]], which is owned by [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]]. The company presented the [[Wisden Trophy]], for Test matches between [[English cricket team|England]] and [[West Indian cricket team|West Indies]], in 1963 to celebrate its 100th edition.\n\nIn 2013, a history of ''Wisden'' was published: ''The Little Wonder: The Remarkable History of Wisden'', by [[Robert Winder]] ({{ISBN|978-1408136263}}). \"The Little Wonder\" was John Wisden's nickname.\n\n== Editions ==\n''Wisden'' is a small-paged but a very thick book (over 1,500 pages in modern editions) with a distinctive bright yellow cover that it has carried since the 75th edition in 1938. Prior to that, covers varied between yellow, buff and salmon pink. That edition was also the first to display the famous [[woodcut]] of two cricketers, by [[Eric Ravilious]],<ref>{{cite web | title=Wisden Almanack | website=ESPNcricinfo.com | date=2006-02-06 | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/155556.html | access-date=2019-09-25 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190925042907/http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/155556.html | archive-date=25 September 2019 | url-status=live }}</ref> on its cover. It is published each April, just before the start of the English domestic cricket season. Since 2003 the woodcut has been replaced as the main feature of the front cover by a photograph of a current cricketer, but still appears albeit in a much reduced size.\n\nIt is produced in both hardcover and softcover versions. Since 2006, a larger format edition has been published on an experimental basis. This is said to be in response to requests from readers who find the print size of the standard edition hard to read. It is around twice the traditional size and was published in a limited edition of 5,000. It is not a [[large print]] book as such, as the print will still be of a size found in many standard books.\n\nFrom 2011 an Epub version, ''The Shorter Wisden'', has been available in online bookstores. Described by the publishers as a \"distillation of what's best in its bigger brother\", it includes the Notes by the Editor, all the articles, reviews and obituaries and the reports on all England's Test matches for the year in question. Excluded are the statistics and other cricket reports contained within the ''Almanack'' proper.\n\n== Contents ==\nThe contents of a contemporary edition include the following sections:\n\n=== Comment ===\nAround a hundred pages of articles on cricketing topics, including the introductory \"Notes by the Editor\", which address often controversial cricket issues and always provoke discussion in the cricketing world.\n\n=== Awards ===\nThe traditional [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year]] awards, which date back to 1889, and the [[Wisden Leading Cricketer of the World]] award, started in 2004.\n\n=== Records ===\nTraditionally the main source for key statistics about the game, although it has never attempted to be comprehensive. Nowadays the records section is intended to be complementary to the much more detailed data available online at ''Wisden''{{'}}s associated website [[ESPNcricinfo]].\n\n=== English cricket ===\nBy far the largest section of the book. Hugely detailed coverage, including scorecards of every [[First-class cricket|First class]] game played in the previous English summer, and summaries of [[Minor counties of English cricket|minor counties]], second eleven, university, school and premier [[club cricket]], as well as the [[Village Cup]].\n\n=== Overseas cricket ===\nFull coverage of all international cricket and brief coverage of domestic first class cricket outside England.\n\n=== Law and administration ===\nThis short section, 80 pages in the 2010 edition, has information about and addresses of official cricket bodies as well as the full [[laws of cricket]], together with appendices. There are also details of meetings held by official bodies, including their major decisions, as well as articles about the [[Duckworth\u2013Lewis method]] and [[Powerplay (cricket)|Powerplays]]. The laws have been omitted from the most recent editions.\n\n=== The Wisden Review ===\nThis section includes the Chronicle (noteworthy events from the previous year), reviews of other cricket books published in the year, noteworthy retirements and the highly regarded obituaries section among others.\n\n==== Book reviews and the Wisden Book of the Year ====\n\n[[John Arlott]] wrote the Books section from its inception in the 1950 edition until the 1992 edition, just before he died. Beginning with the 1993 edition the Books section has been written by a different person each year, often someone \"with a literary reputation first and a separate enthusiasm for cricket\".<ref>{{cite book | chapter=Preface| author-link=Matthew Engel| first=Matthew |last=Engel| title=Wisden Cricketers' Almanack |edition=1993|page=4|publisher=Sporting Handbooks Ltd}}</ref> The first such reviewer was [[J.

The majority involve match reports for the various fixtures recorded each year, but also biographies, reviews and opinion. Many great cricket writers have written for ''Wisden'', along with many great cricketers. [[Neville Cardus]] contributed many notable essays and for many years [[John Arlott]] was responsible for the book reviews.\n\n== Five Cricketers of the Year ==\nSince 1902 (with the occasional exception) ''Wisden'' has honoured five cricketers for their outstanding achievements over the previous year. Further details, with a full list of recipients of the award, can be found at [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year]].\n\n== Indices and anthologies ==\nAt least two indices to ''Wisden'' have been published:\n* ''Index to Wisden, 1864\u20131943'' by Rex Pogson (1944)\n* ''An Index to Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 1864\u20131984'' by Derek Barnard (1985)\n\nAn index from 1985 onwards is available in pdf form on the ''Wisden'' web site.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/special-interest/wisden/wisden-index/ | title=Wisden Index | accessdate=2019-09-25 | website=Bloomsbury.com | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119180820/http://bloomsbury.com/uk/special-interest/wisden/wisden-index/ | archive-date=19 November 2015 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nA number of anthologies of articles from ''Wisden'' have been published.

From the 33rd (1896) edition onwards hardback copies became available at twice the price of the softback.\n\nIn 1889 the ''Almanack'' published its first photoplate, commissioned to accompany the Editor's nomination of six great Bowlers of the Year. From then on a photoplate appeared each year up to and including 1915. The plates were attached to an un-numbered page in the ''Almanack'' and had a tissue protector. They continued to show a number of selected players of the year except in 1896, when [[W G Grace]] was the only subject, and in 1913, when the 50th edition published no selections but celebrated [[John Wisden]] himself. After a two-year hiatus during World War 1 the plate reappeared in 1918, but as a mechanically printed image depicting five School Bowlers of the Year. The image in the 1919 edition continued to reflect wartime exigencies with its five Public School Cricketers of the Year before normal service resumed in 1920 with five Batsmen of the Year. From then on, with four exceptions (see [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year]]), the norm was to include an image of five Cricketers of the Year. It was not until 1938 that other photographs were introduced.\n\nFrom 1933 to 1939 the softback editions of the ''Almanack'' contained a cricket bat bookmark attached by the blade to the inside of the spine with yellow string. The bat handle of the bookmark is easily lost and softbacks with entirely intact bookmarks command a price premium.\n\nIn 1938 the ''Almanack'' underwent some significant style, design and material changes under the supervision of [[Robert Harling (typographer)|Robert Henry Harling]].<ref>{{cite book | chapter=Obituaries| title=Wisden Cricketers' Almanack |edition=2009|page=1605|publisher=Sporting Handbooks Ltd}}</ref> He introduced a new typeface and new designs for the front covers of both the softback and hardback editions. A yellow linen cover featuring the iconic woodcut by [[Eric Ravilious]] replaced the paper wrapper of the softback edition \u2013 a reason why softbacks from this time onwards are often referred to as \"linens\" even though they changed to a cloth-effect card binding in 1957. The design of the softback from 1938 onwards is probably the one most associated with the word \"Wisden\" in the mind of the general public.\n\nThere was a change to the orientation of the gilt lettering on the spines of hardbacks from 1941 to 1948. This was probably required by, and then a relict of, the slimness of the volumes published during World War 2. Excepting the 1963 centenary softback, the external appearance of both types of the ''Almanack'' then remained substantially unchanged until 1965 when the hardback was issued with a dust jacket. This was printed on yellow paper with the same design as the softback, giving a uniformity of appearance to both formats.\n\nBetween 1965 and 1978 the woodcut and text elements of the softback covers and the hardback dust jackets were printed in a variety of colours before reverting to black on yellow from 1979 onwards. Since that time some other changes have occurred to the style, design and materials:\n\n*Between 1982 and 1984 the hardback dust jackets were printed on white paper\n*Colour photographs first appeared in the ''Almanack'' in 1988\n*From 1994 the hardback dust jackets were laminated, making them more resistant to wear and tear\n*In 2001 the layout of the front board of the hardback was changed\n*In 2003 a new style of photo dust jacket was introduced, although readers were informed that those who preferred the \"traditional cover\" could order one free from the publisher. This offer did not last: from the following year onwards a charge was made for providing these covers.\n\nMinor changes of style have taken place throughout the ''Almanack''{{'}}s history, and are documented in a collector's guide that was updated and reprinted in 2011.<ref name=\"Rice & Renshaw 2011\">{{cite book|last1=Rice|first1=Jonathan|last2=Renshaw|first2=Andrew|title=The Wisden Collector's Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DnuQD4swYGoC|year=2011|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4081-6527-0}}</ref>\n\n== Facsimile editions ==\n\nDue to their rarity the early editions of ''Wisden'', and editions published during the two World Wars, are rare and expensive. However, every edition up to 1946 is also available in facsimile form.\n\nThe first facsimile set was printed by Billing & Sons in 1960. Approximately 150 softback copies were produced of each year from 1864 to 1878 and made available either as part of a set or as singles. The facsimiles are clearly marked with an entry in capital letters at the bottom of the title page: \"Facsimile edition 1960 made and printed in Great Britain by Billing and Sons Ltd., Guildford and London\".\n\nLowe and Brydone produced another print run of the first 15 years in 1974. The run was limited again to 150 softback sets. These facsimiles are marked with an entry in capital letters at the bottom of the title page: \"Second facsimile edition made and printed in Great Britain by Lowe and Brydone (Printers) Limited\".\n\nIn 1991 John Wisden & Co Ltd produced its own facsimile set in a distinctive yellow box. This again comprised editions from 1864 to 1878 inclusive and was limited to 1000 sets. The individual books are not strictly facsimiles, and cannot be mistaken for originals, because although they include a copy of the original covers they are hardbound in red boards with \"''WISDEN'' FACSIMILE\" in gilt on the front and the set number \u2013 \"No. X of 1000\" \u2013 on the back. Internally there is also an entry to the effect that the editions are facsimiles at the bottom of each title page: \"This facsimile edition is published in 1991 by John Wisden & Co. Ltd. and printed by The Eastern Press Ltd., Reading\".\n\nIn recent years a more extensive range of facsimiles has been produced by the Willows Publishing Company Ltd. As of early 2014, softback and hardback editions up to and including 1946 have been published. Like the ''Wisden'' facsimile set, the Willows softback facsimiles up to 1937 are hardbound, in tan cloth with gilt embossing, but from 1938 onwards they are true facsimiles with yellow linen covers. The hardback editions are also true facsimiles, with dark brown covers upon which the original gilt embossing is reproduced. Internally all Willows editions are identified as reprints at the base of the title page and limited edition numbers, where applicable, are also marked on the binding or cover.<ref>{{cite web | title=Willows Reprints | website=Willows Publishing Company | url=http://www.willowsreprints.com/ | access-date=2019-09-25 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140211101523/http://www.willowsreprints.com/ | archive-date=11 February 2014 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe first three facsimile sets reproduced the wrong back cover for the 1878 edition \u2013 they incorrectly showed a list of articles supplied by John Wisden & Co. The Willows facsimile contains the correct advertisement, for a book on Oxford and Cambridge cricket matches from 1827 to 1876.\n\nTo celebrate the 150th edition, a facsimile of the 1864 edition was offered by John Wisden & Co as an incentive for those who subscribed to both the 2013 and 2014 editions.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://media.bloomsbury.com/rep/files/wisdena5leaflet.pdf | title=Celebrate Wisden's 150th Edition | website=Bloomsbury.com | access-date=2019-09-25 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616172137/http://media.bloomsbury.com/rep/files/wisdena5leaflet.pdf | archive-date=16 June 2013 | url-status=live }}</ref> The facsimile offer was repeated in 2014 for those willing to subscribe to the ''Almanack'' by direct debit. This is not a true facsimile as the back cover does not reproduce the \"List of Articles\" of the original, but instead on the inside there is an advertisement for ''Wisden'' reprints from the Willows Publishing Company and on the back a celebration of 150 years of ''Wisden''. At the bottom of the back cover information is provided about the reprint: \"This reprint of the first edition of ''Wisden'' was produced in 2013 for the publisher, John Wisden & Co, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing Plc. Printed and bound by MPG Books.\"\n\nFacsimile dust jackets are available for editions of ''Wisden'' from 1965 to 2003 to replace those that have been lost or damaged.<ref>{{cite web | title=Wisden's Official Dust Jacket | website=Sportspages | url=http://www.sportspages.com/wisden/wisden_dust_jackets/ | access-date=2019-09-25 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140218164555/http://www.sportspages.com/wisden/wisden_dust_jackets/ | archive-date=18 February 2014 | url-status=live }}</ref> They are also offered from 2004 onward as \"traditional covers\" that can be substituted for the original photo dust jackets. Supplied by ''Wisden''{{'}}s \"official dust jacket supplier\", these jackets are laminated and are printed in black on yellow (unlike the original jackets issued with the editions from 1965 to 1978 that incorporated colour elements). Replacement dust jackets are also clearly distinguishable from the originals as they are marked on the back cover with the words \"REPLACEMENT DUST JACKET\".\n\nThe same supplier offers traditional design dust jackets for editions from 1946 to 1964. Although these mimic the appearance of the softback covers they are not true facsimiles as the original hardback editions were never issued with dust jackets.\n\nOn 1 December 2018 Willows Publishing sold all their remaining stock of circa 2500 books to www.wisdenauction.com\n\n== Print runs ==\n\nThe size of ''Wisden'' print runs is of considerable interest to collectors as rarity has a very strong influence on the value of individual editions.\n\nThe most reliable, or rather most widely quoted, source of information on print runs is an article by Leslie Gutteridge titled \"A History of ''Wisden''\" published in the 1963 ''Almanack''.<ref name=\"Gutteridge 1963\">{{cite book | chapter=A History of Wisden| first=L. E. S. |last=Gutteridge| title=Wisden Cricketers' Almanack |edition=1963|pages=74\u201388|publisher=Sporting Handbooks Ltd}}</ref> In this article the writer states that it had proved impossible to trace any printing orders earlier than 1936, having earlier mentioned that records had been lost during the Second World War as a result of two attacks on the publisher and Wisden's Mortlake factory.\n\nDespite the lack of early records Gutteridge notes that editions from 1889 to 1901, except 1896 and 1900, ran to two impressions (''the word \"impression\" rather than \"edition\" is used throughout this section to avoid confusion with Wisden's use of \"edition\" in the book's title''). He also notes in passing the rarity of the 1875 edition, though \"not ... so scarce as the first issue of 1864\", without providing specific details.\n\nIt is for the years from 1936 onwards that Gutteridge puts numbers to the print runs, providing either combined figures, or a breakdown of softback and/or hardback numbers, for each year to 1949:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|-\n!Year!!Total!!Softback!!Hardback\n|-\n|1936||8,500|| \u2013 || \u2013\n|-\n|1937||8,000|| \u2013 || \u2013\n|-\n|1938|| \u2013 ||12,000||n/k\n|-\n|1939|| \u2013 ||12,000||n/k\n|-\n|1940|| \u2013 ||8,000||n/k\n|-\n|1941||4,000||3,200||800\n|-\n|1942||5,000||4,100||900\n|-\n|1943||7,000||5,600||1,400\n|-\n|1944||7,000||5,600||1,400\n|-\n|1945||8,000||6,500||1,500\n|-\n|1946||16,000||11,000||5,000\n|-\n|1947||20,000||14,000||6,000\n|-\n|1948||21,000||14,500||6,500\n|-\n|1949||31,500||21,000||10,500\n|}\n\nAfter 1949 he notes that numbers diminished, although at the time he wrote the article sales of the softback and hardback editions were still 11,000 and 10,000 respectively. It is likely that these figures were greatly exceeded in the centenary year as the 1963 edition ran to three impressions.\n\nIn more recent years sales of the 2006 edition exceeded 50,000 in total.<ref>{{cite book | chapter=Preface to the 2007 Edition| first=Matthew Engel |last=Wisden Cricketers| title=Wisden Cricketers' Almanack |edition=2007|pages=7|publisher=Sporting Handbooks Ltd}}</ref> The size of the print run was based on the publisher's belief that England's successful [[The Ashes|Ashes]] campaign the previous summer would attract considerable public interest.\n\nAlthough unsupported by any reliable documentation, it is almost certain that print runs were reduced during the First World War. The 1916 edition, also containing as it does the obituary of [[W G Grace]], is the most expensive 20th century ''Wisden''.\n\nThe smallest recent print runs are believed to be for the years 1969 to 1971.\n\n== Collecting ''Wisden''s ==\n\nCollecting ''Wisden''s is popular among cricket followers, and early editions command high prices. The first edition, only 112 pages long, sold for one [[shilling]]. Rare copies of the early editions can sell for thousands of pounds.<ref>{{cite web|title=1864 Original Paperback Wisden.

From Pardon's becoming editor of ''Wisden'' in 1887, the editor was nearly always a CRA partner and the CRA was responsible for the editorial production of the ''Almanack'', until in 1965 it merged with the [[Press Association]] (PA).<ref>{{cite book | chapter=Preface to the 1966 Edition| first=Norman |last=Preston| title=Wisden Cricketers' Almanack |edition=1966|pages= vi\u2013vii|publisher=Sporting Handbooks Ltd}}</ref>\n\n''Wisden'' was acquired and published by [[Robert Maxwell]]'s publishing conglomerate, Macdonald, in the 1970s. Cricket fan [[John Paul Getty, Jr.|Sir John Paul Getty, Jr.]], bought the company, John Wisden & Co., in 1993<ref name=ft /> and in December 2008 it was sold to [[A&C Black]], which is owned by [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]]. The company presented the [[Wisden Trophy]], for Test matches between [[English cricket team|England]] and [[West Indian cricket team|West Indies]], in 1963 to celebrate its 100th edition.\n\nIn 2013, a history of ''Wisden'' was published: ''The Little Wonder: The Remarkable History of Wisden'', by [[Robert Winder]] ({{ISBN|978-1408136263}}). \"The Little Wonder\" was John Wisden's nickname.\n\n== Editions ==\n''Wisden'' is a small-paged but a very thick book (over 1,500 pages in modern editions) with a distinctive bright yellow cover that it has carried since the 75th edition in 1938. Prior to that, covers varied between yellow, buff and salmon pink. That edition was also the first to display the famous [[woodcut]] of two cricketers, by [[Eric Ravilious]],<ref>{{cite web | title=Wisden Almanack | website=ESPNcricinfo.com | date=2006-02-06 | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/155556.html | access-date=2019-09-25 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190925042907/http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/155556.html | archive-date=25 September 2019 | url-status=live }}</ref> on its cover. It is published each April, just before the start of the English domestic cricket season. Since 2003 the woodcut has been replaced as the main feature of the front cover by a photograph of a current cricketer, but still appears albeit in a much reduced size.\n\nIt is produced in both hardcover and softcover versions. Since 2006, a larger format edition has been published on an experimental basis. This is said to be in response to requests from readers who find the print size of the standard edition hard to read. It is around twice the traditional size and was published in a limited edition of 5,000. It is not a [[large print]] book as such, as the print will still be of a size found in many standard books.\n\nFrom 2011 an Epub version, ''The Shorter Wisden'', has been available in online bookstores. Described by the publishers as a \"distillation of what's best in its bigger brother\", it includes the Notes by the Editor, all the articles, reviews and obituaries and the reports on all England's Test matches for the year in question. Excluded are the statistics and other cricket reports contained within the ''Almanack'' proper.\n\n== Contents ==\nThe contents of a contemporary edition include the following sections:\n\n=== Comment ===\nAround a hundred pages of articles on cricketing topics, including the introductory \"Notes by the Editor\", which address often controversial cricket issues and always provoke discussion in the cricketing world.\n\n=== Awards ===\nThe traditional [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year]] awards, which date back to 1889, and the [[Wisden Leading Cricketer of the World]] award, started in 2004.\n\n=== Records ===\nTraditionally the main source for key statistics about the game, although it has never attempted to be comprehensive. Nowadays the records section is intended to be complementary to the much more detailed data available online at ''Wisden''{{'}}s associated website [[ESPNcricinfo]].\n\n=== English cricket ===\nBy far the largest section of the book. Hugely detailed coverage, including scorecards of every [[First-class cricket|First class]] game played in the previous English summer, and summaries of [[Minor counties of English cricket|minor counties]], second eleven, university, school and premier [[club cricket]], as well as the [[Village Cup]].\n\n=== Overseas cricket ===\nFull coverage of all international cricket and brief coverage of domestic first class cricket outside England.\n\n=== Law and administration ===\nThis short section, 80 pages in the 2010 edition, has information about and addresses of official cricket bodies as well as the full [[laws of cricket]], together with appendices. There are also details of meetings held by official bodies, including their major decisions, as well as articles about the [[Duckworth\u2013Lewis method]] and [[Powerplay (cricket)|Powerplays]]. The laws have been omitted from the most recent editions.\n\n=== The Wisden Review ===\nThis section includes the Chronicle (noteworthy events from the previous year), reviews of other cricket books published in the year, noteworthy retirements and the highly regarded obituaries section among others.\n\n==== Book reviews and the Wisden Book of the Year ====\n\n[[John Arlott]] wrote the Books section from its inception in the 1950 edition until the 1992 edition, just before he died. Beginning with the 1993 edition the Books section has been written by a different person each year, often someone \"with a literary reputation first and a separate enthusiasm for cricket\".<ref>{{cite book | chapter=Preface| author-link=Matthew Engel| first=Matthew |last=Engel| title=Wisden Cricketers' Almanack |edition=1993|page=4|publisher=Sporting Handbooks Ltd}}</ref> The first such reviewer was [[J.

The majority involve match reports for the various fixtures recorded each year, but also biographies, reviews and opinion. Many great cricket writers have written for ''Wisden'', along with many great cricketers. [[Neville Cardus]] contributed many notable essays and for many years [[John Arlott]] was responsible for the book reviews.\n\n== Five Cricketers of the Year ==\nSince 1902 (with the occasional exception) ''Wisden'' has honoured five cricketers for their outstanding achievements over the previous year. Further details, with a full list of recipients of the award, can be found at [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year]].\n\n== Indices and anthologies ==\nAt least two indices to ''Wisden'' have been published:\n* ''Index to Wisden, 1864\u20131943'' by Rex Pogson (1944)\n* ''An Index to Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 1864\u20131984'' by Derek Barnard (1985)\n\nAn index from 1985 onwards is available in pdf form on the ''Wisden'' web site.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/special-interest/wisden/wisden-index/ | title=Wisden Index | accessdate=2019-09-25 | website=Bloomsbury.com | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119180820/http://bloomsbury.com/uk/special-interest/wisden/wisden-index/ | archive-date=19 November 2015 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nA number of anthologies of articles from ''Wisden'' have been published. These include:\n* ''Wisden Anthology'' by [[Benny Green (saxophonist)|Benny Green]] (1979)\n* ''Wisden Book of Obituaries'' edited by Benny Green (1986)\n* ''The Wisden Papers of [[Neville Cardus]] (Wisden Papers)'' edited by Benny Green (1989)\n* ''The Wisden Papers'' edited by Benny Green (1990)\n* ''The Concise Wisden: An Illustrated Anthology of 125 Years'' edited by Benny Green (1990)\n* ''Wisden Anthology: 1864\u20131900'' edited by Benny Green (1992)\n* ''Wisden Anthology: 1901\u20131939'' edited by Benny Green (1992)\n* ''Wisden Anthology: 1940\u20131963'' edited by Benny Green (1992)\n* ''Wisden Anthology: 1964\u20131982'' edited by Benny Green (1992)\n* ''Endless Summer: 140 Years of Australian Cricket in Wisden'' edited by [[Gideon Haigh]] (2003)\n* ''The Wisden Collection: Volume 1'' edited by Graeme Wright (2004)\n* ''The Wisden Collection: Volume 2'' edited by Graeme Wright (2005)\n* ''Wisden at Lords: An Illustrated Anthology'' edited by Graeme Wright (2005)\n* ''Wisden Anthology: 1978\u20132006: Cricket's Age of Revolution'' edited by [[Stephen Moss]] (2006)\n\n== Style, design, graphical content and materials ==\nFor the first 32 years of its existence the ''Almanack'' was only published in softback form, in a paper cover that varied in colour through the years between shades of pink, yellow and buff. From the 33rd (1896) edition onwards hardback copies became available at twice the price of the softback.\n\nIn 1889 the ''Almanack'' published its first photoplate, commissioned to accompany the Editor's nomination of six great Bowlers of the Year. From then on a photoplate appeared each year up to and including 1915. The plates were attached to an un-numbered page in the ''Almanack'' and had a tissue protector. They continued to show a number of selected players of the year except in 1896, when [[W G Grace]] was the only subject, and in 1913, when the 50th edition published no selections but celebrated [[John Wisden]] himself. After a two-year hiatus during World War 1 the plate reappeared in 1918, but as a mechanically printed image depicting five School Bowlers of the Year. The image in the 1919 edition continued to reflect wartime exigencies with its five Public School Cricketers of the Year before normal service resumed in 1920 with five Batsmen of the Year. From then on, with four exceptions (see [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year]]), the norm was to include an image of five Cricketers of the Year. It was not until 1938 that other photographs were introduced.\n\nFrom 1933 to 1939 the softback editions of the ''Almanack'' contained a cricket bat bookmark attached by the blade to the inside of the spine with yellow string. The bat handle of the bookmark is easily lost and softbacks with entirely intact bookmarks command a price premium.\n\nIn 1938 the ''Almanack'' underwent some significant style, design and material changes under the supervision of [[Robert Harling (typographer)|Robert Henry Harling]].<ref>{{cite book | chapter=Obituaries| title=Wisden Cricketers' Almanack |edition=2009|page=1605|publisher=Sporting Handbooks Ltd}}</ref> He introduced a new typeface and new designs for the front covers of both the softback and hardback editions. A yellow linen cover featuring the iconic woodcut by [[Eric Ravilious]] replaced the paper wrapper of the softback edition \u2013 a reason why softbacks from this time onwards are often referred to as \"linens\" even though they changed to a cloth-effect card binding in 1957. The design of the softback from 1938 onwards is probably the one most associated with the word \"Wisden\" in the mind of the general public.\n\nThere was a change to the orientation of the gilt lettering on the spines of hardbacks from 1941 to 1948. This was probably required by, and then a relict of, the slimness of the volumes published during World War 2. Excepting the 1963 centenary softback, the external appearance of both types of the ''Almanack'' then remained substantially unchanged until 1965 when the hardback was issued with a dust jacket. This was printed on yellow paper with the same design as the softback, giving a uniformity of appearance to both formats.\n\nBetween 1965 and 1978 the woodcut and text elements of the softback covers and the hardback dust jackets were printed in a variety of colours before reverting to black on yellow from 1979 onwards. Since that time some other changes have occurred to the style, design and materials:\n\n*Between 1982 and 1984 the hardback dust jackets were printed on white paper\n*Colour photographs first appeared in the ''Almanack'' in 1988\n*From 1994 the hardback dust jackets were laminated, making them more resistant to wear and tear\n*In 2001 the layout of the front board of the hardback was changed\n*In 2003 a new style of photo dust jacket was introduced, although readers were informed that those who preferred the \"traditional cover\" could order one free from the publisher. This offer did not last: from the following year onwards a charge was made for providing these covers.\n\nMinor changes of style have taken place throughout the ''Almanack''{{'}}s history, and are documented in a collector's guide that was updated and reprinted in 2011.<ref name=\"Rice & Renshaw 2011\">{{cite book|last1=Rice|first1=Jonathan|last2=Renshaw|first2=Andrew|title=The Wisden Collector's Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DnuQD4swYGoC|year=2011|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4081-6527-0}}</ref>\n\n== Facsimile editions ==\n\nDue to their rarity the early editions of ''Wisden'', and editions published during the two World Wars, are rare and expensive. However, every edition up to 1946 is also available in facsimile form.\n\nThe first facsimile set was printed by Billing & Sons in 1960. Approximately 150 softback copies were produced of each year from 1864 to 1878 and made available either as part of a set or as singles. The facsimiles are clearly marked with an entry in capital letters at the bottom of the title page: \"Facsimile edition 1960 made and printed in Great Britain by Billing and Sons Ltd., Guildford and London\".\n\nLowe and Brydone produced another print run of the first 15 years in 1974. The run was limited again to 150 softback sets. These facsimiles are marked with an entry in capital letters at the bottom of the title page: \"Second facsimile edition made and printed in Great Britain by Lowe and Brydone (Printers) Limited\".\n\nIn 1991 John Wisden & Co Ltd produced its own facsimile set in a distinctive yellow box. This again comprised editions from 1864 to 1878 inclusive and was limited to 1000 sets. The individual books are not strictly facsimiles, and cannot be mistaken for originals, because although they include a copy of the original covers they are hardbound in red boards with \"''WISDEN'' FACSIMILE\" in gilt on the front and the set number \u2013 \"No. X of 1000\" \u2013 on the back. Internally there is also an entry to the effect that the editions are facsimiles at the bottom of each title page: \"This facsimile edition is published in 1991 by John Wisden & Co. Ltd. and printed by The Eastern Press Ltd., Reading\".\n\nIn recent years a more extensive range of facsimiles has been produced by the Willows Publishing Company Ltd. As of early 2014, softback and hardback editions up to and including 1946 have been published. Like the ''Wisden'' facsimile set, the Willows softback facsimiles up to 1937 are hardbound, in tan cloth with gilt embossing, but from 1938 onwards they are true facsimiles with yellow linen covers. The hardback editions are also true facsimiles, with dark brown covers upon which the original gilt embossing is reproduced. Internally all Willows editions are identified as reprints at the base of the title page and limited edition numbers, where applicable, are also marked on the binding or cover.<ref>{{cite web | title=Willows Reprints | website=Willows Publishing Company | url=http://www.willowsreprints.com/ | access-date=2019-09-25 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140211101523/http://www.willowsreprints.com/ | archive-date=11 February 2014 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe first three facsimile sets reproduced the wrong back cover for the 1878 edition \u2013 they incorrectly showed a list of articles supplied by John Wisden & Co. The Willows facsimile contains the correct advertisement, for a book on Oxford and Cambridge cricket matches from 1827 to 1876.\n\nTo celebrate the 150th edition, a facsimile of the 1864 edition was offered by John Wisden & Co as an incentive for those who subscribed to both the 2013 and 2014 editions.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://media.bloomsbury.com/rep/files/wisdena5leaflet.pdf | title=Celebrate Wisden's 150th Edition | website=Bloomsbury.com | access-date=2019-09-25 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616172137/http://media.bloomsbury.com/rep/files/wisdena5leaflet.pdf | archive-date=16 June 2013 | url-status=live }}</ref> The facsimile offer was repeated in 2014 for those willing to subscribe to the ''Almanack'' by direct debit. This is not a true facsimile as the back cover does not reproduce the \"List of Articles\" of the original, but instead on the inside there is an advertisement for ''Wisden'' reprints from the Willows Publishing Company and on the back a celebration of 150 years of ''Wisden''. At the bottom of the back cover information is provided about the reprint: \"This reprint of the first edition of ''Wisden'' was produced in 2013 for the publisher, John Wisden & Co, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing Plc. Printed and bound by MPG Books.\"\n\nFacsimile dust jackets are available for editions of ''Wisden'' from 1965 to 2003 to replace those that have been lost or damaged.<ref>{{cite web | title=Wisden's Official Dust Jacket | website=Sportspages | url=http://www.sportspages.com/wisden/wisden_dust_jackets/ | access-date=2019-09-25 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140218164555/http://www.sportspages.com/wisden/wisden_dust_jackets/ | archive-date=18 February 2014 | url-status=live }}</ref> They are also offered from 2004 onward as \"traditional covers\" that can be substituted for the original photo dust jackets. Supplied by ''Wisden''{{'}}s \"official dust jacket supplier\", these jackets are laminated and are printed in black on yellow (unlike the original jackets issued with the editions from 1965 to 1978 that incorporated colour elements). Replacement dust jackets are also clearly distinguishable from the originals as they are marked on the back cover with the words \"REPLACEMENT DUST JACKET\".\n\nThe same supplier offers traditional design dust jackets for editions from 1946 to 1964. Although these mimic the appearance of the softback covers they are not true facsimiles as the original hardback editions were never issued with dust jackets.\n\nOn 1st December 2018 Willows Publishing sold all their remaining stock of circa 2500 books to www.wisdenauction.com\n\n== Print runs ==\n\nThe size of ''Wisden'' print runs is of considerable interest to collectors as rarity has a very strong influence on the value of individual editions.\n\nThe most reliable, or rather most widely quoted, source of information on print runs is an article by Leslie Gutteridge titled \"A History of ''Wisden''\" published in the 1963 ''Almanack''.<ref name=\"Gutteridge 1963\">{{cite book | chapter=A History of Wisden| first=L. E. S. |last=Gutteridge| title=Wisden Cricketers' Almanack |edition=1963|pages=74\u201388|publisher=Sporting Handbooks Ltd}}</ref> In this article the writer states that it had proved impossible to trace any printing orders earlier than 1936, having earlier mentioned that records had been lost during the Second World War as a result of two attacks on the publisher and Wisden's Mortlake factory.\n\nDespite the lack of early records Gutteridge notes that editions from 1889 to 1901, except 1896 and 1900, ran to two impressions (''the word \"impression\" rather than \"edition\" is used throughout this section to avoid confusion with Wisden's use of \"edition\" in the book's title''). He also notes in passing the rarity of the 1875 edition, though \"not ... so scarce as the first issue of 1864\", without providing specific details.\n\nIt is for the years from 1936 onwards that Gutteridge puts numbers to the print runs, providing either combined figures, or a breakdown of softback and/or hardback numbers, for each year to 1949:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|-\n!Year!!Total!!Softback!!Hardback\n|-\n|1936||8,500|| - || -\n|-\n|1937||8,000|| - || -\n|-\n|1938|| - ||12,000||n/k\n|-\n|1939|| - ||12,000||n/k\n|-\n|1940|| - ||8,000||n/k\n|-\n|1941||4,000||3,200||800\n|-\n|1942||5,000||4,100||900\n|-\n|1943||7,000||5,600||1,400\n|-\n|1944||7,000||5,600||1,400\n|-\n|1945||8,000||6,500||1,500\n|-\n|1946||16,000||11,000||5,000\n|-\n|1947||20,000||14,000||6,000\n|-\n|1948||21,000||14,500||6,500\n|-\n|1949||31,500||21,000||10,500\n|}\n\nAfter 1949 he notes that numbers diminished, although at the time he wrote the article sales of the softback and hardback editions were still 11,000 and 10,000 respectively. It is likely that these figures were greatly exceeded in the centenary year as the 1963 edition ran to three impressions.\n\nIn more recent years sales of the 2006 edition exceeded 50,000 in total.<ref>{{cite book | chapter=Preface to the 2007 Edition| first=Matthew Engel |last=Wisden Cricketers| title=Wisden Cricketers' Almanack |edition=2007|pages=7|publisher=Sporting Handbooks Ltd}}</ref> The size of the print run was based on the publisher's belief that England's successful [[The Ashes|Ashes]] campaign the previous summer would attract considerable public interest.\n\nAlthough unsupported by any reliable documentation, it is almost certain that print runs were reduced during the First World War. The 1916 edition, also containing as it does the obituary of [[W G Grace]], is the most expensive 20th century ''Wisden''.\n\nThe smallest recent print runs are believed to be for the years 1969 to 1971.\n\n== Collecting ''Wisden''s ==\n\nCollecting ''Wisden''s is popular among cricket followers, and early editions command high prices. The first edition, only 112 pages long, sold for one [[shilling]]. Rare copies of the early editions can sell for thousands of pounds.<ref>{{cite web|title=1864 Original Paperback Wisden.

It was released on October 11, 2019, by [[Netflix]].\n\n==Plot==\nRay, along with his wife Joanne and daughter Peri, drive on a road trip for Thanksgiving. In the car, it is clear that Ray and his wife are having issues in their relationship. Joanne thinks that Ray isn't himself anymore and they don't laugh together like they used to. Eventually, Peri needs to use the restroom so they take a break at a rest stop. At the gas station, because Ray is low on cash, he can only choose to buy three of four items. A soft drink for his wife, batteries for his daughter's music player, or a cup of coffee and some small shots of alcohol for himself. Ray chooses to buy his wife a soft drink and the coffee and alcohol for himself. While Joanne goes to check the restroom, Ray helps Peri find her portable mirror. While Ray is distracted and trying to find the mirror, Peri unknowingly walks close to the edge of an open construction pit. A stray dog then appears and slowly approaches Peri, forcing her to backup towards the construction pit. After Peri yells to get Ray's attention, Ray decides to throw a rock to scare the dog which inadvertently causes Peri to fall into the open construction site and are injured. We then see Ray waking up after being unconscious from the fall. He is confused and staring at a daze at Peri on the floor. Joanne's muffled voice can be heard yelling at Ray to do something. Ray then quickly turns away from the scene and takes a deep breath. He opens his eyes and realizes what he should do. He helps Peri up and decides to bring her to a nearby hospital. Ray speeds through traffic to get to the hospital. After rushing to the hospital, Joanne accompanies Peri to the basement to obtain a CT scan while Ray waits in the waiting room. \n\nRay passes out from exhaustion. After awakening hours later, he asks the hospital staff if he can see his wife and daughter, but is told they were never brought to the hospital.\n\nRay argues with the hospital staff, who all deny that his wife and daughter were ever admitted. Ray enlists the assistance of two police officers, but the hospital staff and doctors convince them Ray came to the hospital alone, was treated for a head wound, and is confused.\n\nUnable to convince the staff and police of his story, Ray searches for his family on his own and eventually finds them in the sub-basement, just before his daughter is about to have her organs harvested. Ray fights with the hospital staff, causing an explosion, and escapes with his family.\n\nHowever, as Ray drives away, it is revealed that he is experiencing visual hallucinations from psychological trauma resulting from the incident earlier that day.

McElroy]]. It stars [[Sam Worthington]], [[Lily Rabe]], [[Stephen Tobolowsky]], [[Adjoa Andoh]], and Lucy Capri.\n\nThe film had its world premiere at [[Fantastic Fest]] on September 22, 2019. It was released on October 11, 2019, by [[Netflix]].\n\n==Plot==\nRay, along with his wife Joanne and daughter Peri, drive on a road trip for Thanksgiving. They take a break at a rest stop, where Ray and Peri fall into an open construction site and are injured. After rushing to the hospital, Joanne accompanies Peri to the basement to obtain a CT scan while Ray waits in the waiting room. \n\nRay passes out from exhaustion. After awakening hours later, he asks the hospital staff if he can see his wife and daughter, but is told they were never brought to the hospital.\n\nRay argues with the hospital staff, who all deny that his wife and daughter were ever admitted. Ray enlists the assistance of two police officers, but the hospital staff and doctors convince them Ray came to the hospital alone, was treated for a head wound, and is confused.\n\nUnable to convince the staff and police of his story, Ray searches for his family on his own and eventually finds them in the sub-basement, just before his daughter is about to have her organs harvested. Ray fights with the hospital staff, causing an explosion, and escapes with his family.\n\nHowever, as Ray drives away, it is revealed that he is experiencing visual hallucinations from psychological trauma resulting from the incident earlier that day. In reality, Peri died from the fall, and Ray accidentally killed Joanne after pushing her. The trauma of realizing he'd killed his family caused Ray's mind to construct a new reality in which both his wife and daughter are alive. Ray believes he is rescuing them, but it is revealed that he has kidnapped a random patient from surgery, while his wife and daughter are lying dead in the trunk of his car.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sam Worthington]] as Ray Monroe\n* [[Lily Rabe]] as Joanne Monroe\n* [[Stephen Tobolowsky]] as Dr. Berthram\n* [[Adjoa Andoh]] as Dr. Isaacs\n*Shane Dean as Officer Griggs\n* Lauren Cochrane as Officer Chilches\n*Lucy Capri as Peri Monroe\n\n==Production==\nIn November 2018, [[Sam Worthington]] joined the cast, with [[Brad Anderson (director)|Brad Anderson]] attached to direct from a screenplay by [[Alan B.

There is a 2,500 square-mile methane plume hovering over the Four Corners area of the western US. The magnitude of the plume was such that NASA researcher Christian Frankenberg reported to the press that, \"We couldn\u2019t be sure that the signal was real.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.commondreams.org/news/2014/12/30/2500-square-mile-methane-plume-silently-hovering-over-western-us | title=A 2,500 Square-Mile Methane Plume is Silently Hovering over Western US}}</ref> According to NASA: \"The study's lead author, Eric Kort of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, noted the study period predates the widespread use of hydraulic fracturing, known as fracking, near the hot spot. This indicates the methane emissions should not be attributed to fracking but instead to leaks in natural gas production and processing equipment in New Mexico's San Juan Basin, which is the most active coalbed methane production area in the country.\"<ref>[https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2014/09oct_methanehotspot/ U.S. METHANE 'HOT SPOT' BIGGER THAN EXPECTED] NASA, 9 Oct. 2014.</ref>\n\nOther concerns are related to emissions from the hydraulic fracturing chemicals and equipment such as [[volatile organic compound]] (VOC) and [[ozone]].  In 2008, ozone concentrations in [[ambient air]] near drilling sites in [[Sublette County, Wyoming]] were frequently above the [[National Ambient Air Quality Standards]] (NAAQS) of 75&nbsp;ppb<ref name=tribOzoneWyoming/> and have been recorded as high as 125&nbsp;ppb.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} In [[DISH, Texas]], elevated levels of [[disulfide]]s, [[benzene]], [[xylene]]s and [[naphthalene]] have been detected in the air, emitted from compressor stations.<ref name=\"DISH TX SciAm\"/>  In [[Garfield County, Colorado]], an area with a high concentration of drilling rigs, VOC emissions increased 30% between 2004 and 2006.<ref name=\"HeatOnGas\"/>\n\nResearchers from the [[University of Michigan]] analyzed the emissions produced from the hydraulic fracturing equipment at the [[Marcellus Shale]] and [[Eagle Ford Shale]] plays, and concluded that hydraulic pumps accounted for about 83% of the total emissions in the hydraulic fracturing fleet. [[NOx]] emission ranged between 3,600\u20135,600&nbsp;lb/job, [[hydrocarbon|HC]] 232\u2013289&nbsp;lb/job, [[Carbon monoxide|CO]] 859\u20131416&nbsp;lb/job, and [[Particulate matter|PM]] 184\u2013310&nbsp;lb/job. If the fuel efficiencies of the hydraulic fracturing pumps are improved, the emissions can be reduced.<ref name=\"Air Emissions UMICH\"/>\n\nOn April 17, 2012, the EPA issued cost-effective regulations, required by the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], which include the first federal air standards for natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured.<ref name=\"epa-airquality\"/>  The final rules are expected to yield a nearly 95% reduction in VOC emissions from more than 11,000&nbsp;new hydraulically fractured gas wells each year. This reduction would be accomplished primarily through capturing natural gas that escapes into the air, and making it available for sale. The rules would also reduce air toxins, which are known or suspected of causing cancer and other serious health effects, and emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.<ref name=\"epa-airquality\"/>\n\nA study published in the ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'' in April 2014 \"identified a significant regional flux of methane over a large area of shale gas wells in southwestern Pennsylvania in the [[Marcellus formation]] and further identified several pads with high methane emissions.

A consequence of this exemption is that drilling companies are not required to disclose the chemicals that make up the fracturing fluids, making testing for these chemicals in ground water more difficult.|date=November 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AutoZV-21\">{{cite web |url=http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/amall/incidents_where_hydraulic_frac.html |last=Mall |first=Amy |work=Switchboard: NRDC Staff Blog |publisher=[[Natural Resources Defense Council]] |title=Incidents where hydraulic fracturing is a suspected cause of drinking water contamination |date=19 December 2011 |accessdate=23 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222025433/http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/amall/incidents_where_hydraulic_frac.html |archive-date=22 February 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AutoZV-36\">{{cite web |url= http://www.usgs.gov/faq/?q=categories/10132/3830 |title= How is hydraulic fracturing related to earthquakes and tremors? |publisher= [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] |accessdate= 4 November 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141019024105/http://www.usgs.gov/faq/?q=categories%2F10132%2F3830 |archive-date= 19 October 2014 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AutoZV-37\">{{cite press release |url=http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/news-events/seismologists-link-ohio-earthquakes-waste-disposal-wells |title=Ohio Quakes Probably Triggered by Waste Disposal Well, Say Seismologists |date=6 January 2012 |publisher=[[Lamont\u2013Doherty Earth Observatory]] |accessdate=22 February 2012}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Bateman\">{{cite web |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/business/features/2010/06/fracking-in-pennsylvania-201006 |title=A Colossal Fracking Mess |author=Christopher Bateman |date=21 June 2010 |publisher=VanityFair.com |accessdate=3 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Bloomberg 10.01.2012\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-10/pennsylvania-fracking-foes-fault-epa-over-tainted-water-response.html |title=Pennsylvania Fracking Foes Fault EPA Over Tainted Water Response |author=Jim Snyder |author2=Mark Drajem |date=10 January 2012 |agency=Bloomberg |accessdate=19 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Bloomberg 11.01.2012\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-11/fracking-s-political-support-unshaken-by-doctors-call-for-ban.html |title=Fracking Political Support Unshaken by Doctors' Call for Ban |author=Mark Drajem |date=11 January 2012 |agency=Bloomberg |accessdate=19 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BusinessIn10092013\" >{{cite news |url =http://www.businessinsider.com/fracking-leaving-radioactive-pollution-in-pa-2013-10|title=Duke Study: Fracking Is Leaving Radioactive Pollution In Pennsylvania Rivers|work= Business Insider | first =Harrison |last=Jacobs |date=9 October 2013 |publisher= [[Business Insider]] | accessdate=10 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BW 19.01.2012\">{{cite news |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/like-fracking-youll-love-super-fracking-01192012.html |title=Like Fracking?

There is a 2,500 square-mile methane plume hovering over the Four Corners area of the western US. The magnitude of the plume was such that NASA researcher Christian Frankenberg reported to the press that, \"We couldn\u2019t be sure that the signal was real.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.commondreams.org/news/2014/12/30/2500-square-mile-methane-plume-silently-hovering-over-western-us | title=A 2,500 Square-Mile Methane Plume is Silently Hovering over Western US}}</ref> According to NASA: \"The study's lead author, Eric Kort of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, noted the study period predates the widespread use of hydraulic fracturing, known as fracking, near the hot spot. This indicates the methane emissions should not be attributed to fracking but instead to leaks in natural gas production and processing equipment in New Mexico's San Juan Basin, which is the most active coalbed methane production area in the country.\"<ref>[https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2014/09oct_methanehotspot/ U.S. METHANE 'HOT SPOT' BIGGER THAN EXPECTED] NASA, 9 Oct. 2014.</ref>\n\nOther concerns are related to emissions from the hydraulic fracturing chemicals and equipment such as [[volatile organic compound]] (VOC) and [[ozone]].  In 2008, ozone concentrations in [[ambient air]] near drilling sites in [[Sublette County, Wyoming]] were frequently above the [[National Ambient Air Quality Standards]] (NAAQS) of 75&nbsp;ppb<ref name=tribOzoneWyoming/> and have been recorded as high as 125&nbsp;ppb.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} In [[DISH, Texas]], elevated levels of [[disulfide]]s, [[benzene]], [[xylene]]s and [[naphthalene]] have been detected in the air, emitted from compressor stations.<ref name=\"DISH TX SciAm\"/>  In [[Garfield County, Colorado]], an area with a high concentration of drilling rigs, VOC emissions increased 30% between 2004 and 2006.<ref name=\"HeatOnGas\"/>\n\nResearchers from the [[University of Michigan]] analyzed the emissions produced from the hydraulic fracturing equipment at the [[Marcellus Shale]] and [[Eagle Ford Shale]] plays, and concluded that hydraulic pumps accounted for about 83% of the total emissions in the hydraulic fracturing fleet. [[NOx]] emission ranged between 3,600\u20135,600&nbsp;lb/job, [[hydrocarbon|HC]] 232\u2013289&nbsp;lb/job, [[Carbon monoxide|CO]] 859\u20131416&nbsp;lb/job, and [[Particulate matter|PM]] 184\u2013310&nbsp;lb/job. If the fuel efficiencies of the hydraulic fracturing pumps are improved, the emissions can be reduced.<ref name=\"Air Emissions UMICH\"/>\n\nOn April 17, 2012, the EPA issued cost-effective regulations, required by the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], which include the first federal air standards for natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured.<ref name=\"epa-airquality\"/>  The final rules are expected to yield a nearly 95% reduction in VOC emissions from more than 11,000&nbsp;new hydraulically fractured gas wells each year. This reduction would be accomplished primarily through capturing natural gas that escapes into the air, and making it available for sale. The rules would also reduce air toxins, which are known or suspected of causing cancer and other serious health effects, and emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.<ref name=\"epa-airquality\"/>\n\nA study published in the ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'' in April 2014 \"identified a significant regional flux of methane over a large area of shale gas wells in southwestern Pennsylvania in the [[Marcellus formation]] and further identified several pads with high methane emissions.

A consequence of this exemption is that drilling companies are not required to disclose the chemicals that make up the fracturing fluids, making testing for these chemicals in ground water more difficult.|date=November 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AutoZV-21\">{{cite web |url=http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/amall/incidents_where_hydraulic_frac.html |last=Mall |first=Amy |work=Switchboard: NRDC Staff Blog |publisher=[[Natural Resources Defense Council]] |title=Incidents where hydraulic fracturing is a suspected cause of drinking water contamination |date=19 December 2011 |accessdate=23 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222025433/http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/amall/incidents_where_hydraulic_frac.html |archive-date=22 February 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AutoZV-36\">{{cite web |url= http://www.usgs.gov/faq/?q=categories/10132/3830 |title= How is hydraulic fracturing related to earthquakes and tremors? |publisher= [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] |accessdate= 4 November 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141019024105/http://www.usgs.gov/faq/?q=categories%2F10132%2F3830 |archive-date= 19 October 2014 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AutoZV-37\">{{cite press release |url=http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/news-events/seismologists-link-ohio-earthquakes-waste-disposal-wells |title=Ohio Quakes Probably Triggered by Waste Disposal Well, Say Seismologists |date=6 January 2012 |publisher=[[Lamont\u2013Doherty Earth Observatory]] |accessdate=22 February 2012}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Bateman\">{{cite web |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/business/features/2010/06/fracking-in-pennsylvania-201006 |title=A Colossal Fracking Mess |author=Christopher Bateman |date=21 June 2010 |publisher=VanityFair.com |accessdate=3 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Bloomberg 10.01.2012\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-10/pennsylvania-fracking-foes-fault-epa-over-tainted-water-response.html |title=Pennsylvania Fracking Foes Fault EPA Over Tainted Water Response |author=Jim Snyder |author2=Mark Drajem |date=10 January 2012 |agency=Bloomberg |accessdate=19 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Bloomberg 11.01.2012\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-11/fracking-s-political-support-unshaken-by-doctors-call-for-ban.html |title=Fracking Political Support Unshaken by Doctors' Call for Ban |author=Mark Drajem |date=11 January 2012 |agency=Bloomberg |accessdate=19 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BusinessIn10092013\" >{{cite news |url =http://www.businessinsider.com/fracking-leaving-radioactive-pollution-in-pa-2013-10|title=Duke Study: Fracking Is Leaving Radioactive Pollution In Pennsylvania Rivers|work= Business Insider | first =Harrison |last=Jacobs |date=9 October 2013 |publisher= [[Business Insider]] | accessdate=10 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BW 19.01.2012\">{{cite news |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/like-fracking-youll-love-super-fracking-01192012.html |title=Like Fracking?
