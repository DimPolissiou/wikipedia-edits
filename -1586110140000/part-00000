Shokoufeh Provided the opportunity for women and girls to be trained and informed about [[Women's rights|equal rights]] for both women and men. Additionally, Maryam established two branches of a modern school named Dokhtaran Dar al-'Elm and Sanayeh Mazineyeh.

In 1951, she founded a girls' school called Mazineyeh.\n\nDue to patriarchal circumstances and the reluctance of families to educate the girls, she encouraged girls to register to become a student without paying the student registration fee, this was done with one out of every two student and she agreed with their parents and families that they should study and not be taken out of school till the end of their courses. This was the way she encouraged girls to stay in school and study. The school had two branches. One of the branches was Dar al-'Elm and various sciences (Such as reading and writing to mathematics and geography and foreign language training) which were taught, and the condition of admission and degree was a test and test success that was held by the Ministry of Education.

This 8-page weekly magazine, known as Science, published in [[Tehran]] in 1910. Although the magazine did not last long, it was an important development during the Constitutional era. \n\nMaryam Amid, known as the first female journalist in Iran, published the Shokoufeh Newspaper after the closure of the Science Weekly Magazine in 1913.\n\nThe following text was seen on the front page and certification of the journal:<ref name=\":0\" />\n{{quote|Awarding officer and director Maryam Amid, the daughter of the late Aqa Mirza Sayed Razi, was a journalist of ethics, literature, hygiene, child care, direct professional education of maidens, and the refinement of women's ethics about women's schools.

This newspaper was published every week till the death of Maryam in 1919.\n\nThe features of this newspaper could be mentioned in a [[Humour|humorous]] and critical tone, such as addressing Iranian women's issues, [[Girls education|girls' education]], and political issues.\n\n=== From copies to caricaturing\t===\nThe newspaper, which was published almost every two weeks, was originally written in four pages with the Traditional version writing of [[Naskh (script)|Naskhs]], but from the fifth issue was written with the [[Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq script|Nastaliq]] version, and was printed after a year with lead letters. Also on the final page of each issue it was decorated with a [[caricature]], tailored to the subject of the page that the issue was about.  Of course, from the third year and onwards, the caricatures were not included, since the publication lost its pattern at the start of the [[First World War]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Hemat Association ==\nHemat Association was established in 1944 by the managers of the girls\u2019 schools. Maryam Amid, a member of this association, was instrumental in introducing and expanding its activities. One of the important goals of the association, which was headed by Mrs. Nuraldji, was to ban foreign products and prohibit imports of these products. For example, at the same time, the boycott of foreign textiles was on the agenda of this association, and all girls' schools (including students and teachers) were allowed to use only Iranian fabrics and, if there was a violation and purchase of foreign textiles, the guilty person would be fired. Therefore, it came to a result that nearly five thousand people joined the boycott within a month. \n\n== War with superstition ==\nThe struggle against [[superstition]] and fighting with old traditions especially among women was one of the actions of Maryam. She used the ''Shokoufeh newspaper'' to convey the voice of suppression and reactionary ideas. Maryam, in condemning the women's [[underdeveloped]] traditions in [[Iran]], reviewed and raised the situation of women in other parts of the world (especially the situation of [[women in Europe]]), and considered this as the most important and [[Fundamentalism|fundamental]] way of women's awareness in Iran.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n== Death ==\nMaryam died in September 1919 during a trip to her hometown [[Semnan, Iran|Semnan]], of a heart attack. \n \n==See also==\n* [[Iranian women]]   \n* [[Women's rights movement in Iran]]\n* [[Women's rights in Iran]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* \u0641\u0631\u0647\u0646\u06af \u0642\u0648\u0645\u0633\u061b \u0641\u0635\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u067e\u0698\u0648\u0647\u0634\u06cc\u060c \u0641\u0631\u0647\u0646\u06af\u06cc\u060c \u0647\u0646\u0631\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0633\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0634\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0647 \u06f3\u06f7 \u0648 \u06f3\u06f8 \u0628\u0647\u0627\u0631 \u0648 \u062a\u0627\u0628\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u06f1\u06f3\u06f8\u06f6/Ghomis Culture, The quarterly research of cultural and artistic in Semnan Province, numbers 37\u201338, spring and summer 2007.\n* \u0631\u0648\u0632\u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u0633\u0631\u0645\u0627\u06cc\u0647\u060c \u0634\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0647 \u06f2\u06f5\u06f7 (\u06f2 \u0634\u0647\u0631\u06cc\u0648\u0631 \u06f1\u06f3\u06f8\u06f5)-\tSarmayeh Newspaper, number 257, (24 August 2006). \n* [http://www.sharghnewspaper.ir/830514/media.htm#s94047 /Journalist women under the shadow of constitutionalism]{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.barnameh-budjeh.com/npview.asp?ID=1118573 Maryam Amid, Girls' Literacy Light]{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Amid, Maryam}}\n[[Category:People from Semnan, Iran]]\n[[Category:1919 deaths]]\n[[Category:Iranian journalists]]\n[[Category:Iranian women journalists]]\n[[Category:Iranian women's rights activists]]\n[[Category:Iranian women writers]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{copyedit|date=April 2020}}\n'''Maryam Amid Semnani''' ({{lang-fa|\u0645\u0631\u06cc\u0645 \u0639\u0645\u06cc\u062f \u0633\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0646\u06cc}}), was an intellectual and a journalist during the [[Qajar era]]. \nIn 1913, she published the second Iranian women's magazine named the ''Shokoufeh Newspaper''. \n\n== Biography ==\nMaryam Amid was the only daughter of Mir Seyed Razi Semnani, the first representative of [[Semnan, Iran|Semnan]] and [[Shahrud, Iran|Shahrud]] in the [[National Assembly]].

This newspaper was published every week till the death of Maryam in 1919.\n\nThe features of this newspaper could be mentioned in a [[Humour|humorous]] and critical tone, such as addressing Iranian women's issues, [[Girls education|girls' education]], and political issues.\n\n=== From copies to caricaturing\t===\nThe newspaper, which was published almost every two weeks, was originally written in four pages with the Traditional version writing of [[Naskh (script)|Naskhs]], but from the fifth issue was written with the [[Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq script|Nastaliq]] version, and was printed after a year with lead letters. Also on the final page of each issue it was decorated with a [[caricature]], tailored to the subject of the page that the issue was about.  Of course, from the third year and onwards, the caricatures were not included, since the publication lost its pattern at the start of the [[First World War]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Hemat Association ==\nHemat Association was established in 1944 by the managers of the girls\u2019 schools. Maryam Amid, a member of this association, was instrumental in introducing and expanding its activities. One of the important goals of the association, which was headed by Mrs. Nuraldji, was to ban foreign products and prohibit imports of these products. For example, at the same time, the boycott of foreign textiles was on the agenda of this association, and all girls' schools (including students and teachers) were allowed to use only Iranian fabrics and, if there was a violation and purchase of foreign textiles, the guilty person would be fired. Therefore, it came to a result that nearly five thousand people joined the boycott within a month. \n\n== War with superstition ==\nThe struggle against [[superstition]] and fighting with old traditions especially among women was one of the actions of Maryam. She used the ''Shokoufeh newspaper'' to convey the voice of suppression and reactionary ideas. Maryam, in condemning the women's [[underdeveloped]] traditions in [[Iran]], reviewed and raised the situation of women in other parts of the world (especially the situation of [[women in Europe]]), and considered this as the most important and [[Fundamentalism|fundamental]] way of women's awareness in Iran.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n== Death ==\nMaryam died in September 1919 during a trip to her hometown [[Semnan, Iran|Semnan]], of a heart attack. \n \n==See also==\n* [[Iranian women]]   \n* [[Women's rights movement in Iran]]\n* [[Women's rights in Iran]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* \u0641\u0631\u0647\u0646\u06af \u0642\u0648\u0645\u0633\u061b \u0641\u0635\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u067e\u0698\u0648\u0647\u0634\u06cc\u060c \u0641\u0631\u0647\u0646\u06af\u06cc\u060c \u0647\u0646\u0631\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0633\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0634\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0647 \u06f3\u06f7 \u0648 \u06f3\u06f8 \u0628\u0647\u0627\u0631 \u0648 \u062a\u0627\u0628\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u06f1\u06f3\u06f8\u06f6/Ghomis Culture, The quarterly research of cultural and artistic in Semnan Province, numbers 37\u201338, spring and summer 2007.\n* \u0631\u0648\u0632\u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u0633\u0631\u0645\u0627\u06cc\u0647\u060c \u0634\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0647 \u06f2\u06f5\u06f7 (\u06f2 \u0634\u0647\u0631\u06cc\u0648\u0631 \u06f1\u06f3\u06f8\u06f5)-\tSarmayeh Newspaper, number 257, (24 August 2006). \n* [http://www.sharghnewspaper.ir/830514/media.htm#s94047 /Journalist women under the shadow of constitutionalism]{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.barnameh-budjeh.com/npview.asp?ID=1118573 Maryam Amid, Girls' Literacy Light]{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Amid, Maryam}}\n[[Category:People from Semnan, Iran]]\n[[Category:1919 deaths]]\n[[Category:Iranian journalists]]\n[[Category:Iranian women journalists]]\n[[Category:Iranian women's rights activists]]\n[[Category:Iranian women writers]]\n", "name_user": "GalaxyDog", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eThe establishment of a girls\u2019 school:Made unnecessary capital letter lowercase", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryam_Amid"}

The basic system can be expanded with up to 48 KB of RAM (in 16 KB increments), and up to four [[floppy disk drive]]s and/or [[hard disk drive]]s. Tandy/RadioShack provided full-service support including upgrade, repair, and training services in their thousands of stores worldwide.\n\nBy 1979, the TRS-80 had the largest selection of software in the microcomputer market.<ref name=welch2007>{{cite book|last=Welch|first=David and Theresa|title=Priming the Pump: How TRS-80 Enthusiasts Helped Spark the PC Revolution|year=2007|publisher=The Seeker Books|location=Ferndale, Michigan| isbn=978-0-9793468-0-4| url=http://www.microcomputerpioneers.com/}}</ref> Until 1982, the TRS-80 was the best-selling PC line, outselling the [[Apple II series]] by a factor of five according to one analysis.<ref name=\"techland.time.com\"/>\n\nIn mid-1980, the broadly compatible '''TRS-80 Model III''' was released.

Among the Tandy employees who purchased a [[MITS Altair]] [[kit computer]] was [[purchasing agent|buyer]] Don French, who began designing his own computer and showed it to vice president of manufacturing John Roach, Tandy's former [[electronic data processing]] manager. Although the design did not impress Roach, the idea of selling a microcomputer did. When the two men visited [[National Semiconductor]] in California in mid-1976, [[Homebrew Computer Club]] member Steve Leininger's expertise on the [[SC/MP]] microprocessor impressed them. National executives refused to provide Leininger's contact information when French and Roach wanted to hire him as a consultant, but they found Leininger working part-time at [[Byte Shop]]. Leininger was unhappy at National, his wife wanted a better job, and Texas did not have a [[state income tax]]. Hiring him for his technical and retail experience, Leininger and French began working together in June 1976. The company envisioned a kit, but Leininger persuaded the others that because \"too many people can't solder\", a preassembled computer would be better.<ref name=\"swaine19810831\"/>{{r|thomas1977}}{{r|white198708}}{{r|reed1}}\n\nTandy had 11 million customers that might buy a microcomputer, but it would be much more expensive than the {{US$|30}} median price of a RadioShack product, and a great risk for the very conservative company.<ref name=\"reed1\">{{cite web | url=http://www.trs-80.org/trs80-introduction-part1/ | title=The Introduction of the TRS\u201180 (Part 1) | publisher=TRS-80.org | accessdate=January 23, 2015 | author=Reed, Matthew}}</ref>{{r|white198708}} Executives feared losing money as [[Sears]] did with [[Cartrivision]],<ref name=\"leininger19770917\">{{cite conference | url=http://www.trs-80.com/trs80-models-model1.htm | title=TRS-80 architect reminisces about design project | accessdate=February 28, 2011 | author=Leininger, Steven W. |date=September 1977 | conference=San Diego Computer Society}}</ref> and many opposed the project; one executive told French, \"Don't waste my time\u2014we can't sell computers.\" As the popularity of [[Citizens band radio|CB radio]]\u2014at one point comprising more than 20% of RadioShack's sales\u2014declined, however, the company sought new products. In December 1976 French and Leininger received official approval for the project but were told to emphasize cost savings; for example, leaving out lowercase characters saved US$1.50 in components and reduced the retail price by {{US$|5}}. The original {{US$|199}} retail price required [[manufacturing cost]] of {{US$|80}}; the first design had a [[membrane keyboard]] and no video monitor. Leininger persuaded Roach and French to include a better keyboard; it, a monitor, [[datacassette]] storage, and other features required a higher retail price to provide Tandy's typical profit margin. In February 1977 they showed their prototype, running a simple tax-accounting program, to [[Charles Tandy]], head of Tandy Corporation. The program quickly crashed as the computer could not handle the {{US$|150,000}} figure that Tandy typed in as his salary, and the two men added support for [[floating-point math]] to its [[Tiny BASIC]] to prevent a recurrence. The project was formally approved on 2 February 1977; Tandy revealed that he had already leaked the computer's existence to the press. When first inspecting the prototype, he remarked that even if it did not sell, the project could be worthy if only for the publicity it might generate.{{r|ahl198411}}<ref name=\"white198708\">{{Cite magazine |last=White |first=Ron |date=August 1987 |title=The Tandy Story: It all started 10 years ago in a converted used-car showroom... |url=https://archive.org/details/80-microcomputing-magazine-1987-08/page/n51 |magazine=80 Micro |pages=50\u201364 |access-date=2019-05-18}}</ref>{{r|reed1}}\n\nMITS sold 1,000 Altairs in February 1975, and was selling 10,000 a year.

Tandy's {{code|KBFIX}} utility, the Model III, the last Model I firmware, and most third-party operating systems also implement the software fix, and Tandy changed the keyboard during the Model III's lifetime to an [[Alps Electric]] design with sealed switches. The Alps keyboard was available as an upgrade for the Model I for $79.{{r|reedkeybounce}}\n\nThe keyboard is [[memory mapped I/O|memory mapped]] so that certain locations in the processor's memory space correspond to the status of a group of keys.\n\n=== Video and audio===\n[[File:TRS-80-graphics.svg|thumb|Layout of characters and pixels on the TRS-80 display|300px]]\nThe color of the 12\" KCS 172 RCA monitor's{{r|white198708}} text is faintly blue (the standard P4 [[phosphor]] used in black-and white televisions). Green and amber filters, or replacement tubes to reduce [[eye fatigue]] were popular aftermarket items. Later models came with a green-on-black display.\n\nComplaints about the video display quality were common. As Green wrote, \"hells bells, [the monitor] ''is'' a cheap black and white television set with a bit of conversion for computer use\".{{r|green198001}} (The computer could be purchased without the RadioShack monitor.)<ref name=\"fylstra197804\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1978-04/1978_04_BYTE_03-04_Optimization#page/n49/mode/2up | title=The Radio Shack TRS-80: An Owner's Report | work=BYTE | date=April 1978 | accessdate=October 17, 2013 | author=Fylstra, Dan | pages=49}}</ref> CPU access to the screen memory causes visible [[flicker (screen)|flicker]]. The bus arbitration logic blocks video display refresh (video RAM reads) during [[central processing unit|CPU]] writes to the VRAM, causing a short black line. This has little effect on normal BASIC programs, but fast programs made with [[assembly language]] can be affected. Software authors worked to minimize the effect, and many arcade-style [[List of TRS-80 games|games]] are available for the Tandy TRS-80.\n\nBecause of bandwidth problems in the interface card that replaced the TV's tuner, the display loses horizontal sync if large areas of white are displayed. A simple half-hour hardware fix corrects the problem.\n\nLike the Apple II, an unmodified Model I cannot display lowercase letters. The standard character generator has 64 graphics symbols and 64 upper case alphanumeric symbols. The video RAM uses 2102 SRAM chips, which are 1Kb x 1, but the PCB has seven installed, allowing only 128 characters (graphic or alphanumeric) to be displayed (0 to 127). Leaving out an eighth chip saved $1 in manufacturing costs, which would have increased the purchase price of the computer. By installing an eighth 2102 (done by piggybacking it onto chip #7), it is possible to display all 256 characters (which includes lowercase letters).  The 1978 manual for the popular word processor [[Electric Pencil]] came with instructions for modifying the computer. Although the modification needs to be disabled for Level II BASIC, its design became the industry standard and was widely sold in kit form,<ref name=\"reedlc\">{{cite web | url=http://www.trs-80.org/electric-pencil-lowercase-modification/ | title=The Electric Pencil Lower Case Modification | accessdate=27 February 2016 | author=Reed, Matthew}}</ref> along with an eighth 2102 chip with [[descender]]s for the lowercase letters. Later models came with the hardware for the lowercase character set to be displayed with descenders.\n\nSince there is only 1k of video RAM, the Model I's display has 64x16 characters instead of the more common 40x25 or 80x25.\nBoth 64x16 and 32x16 video modes are supported, which is in contrast to 40x25 used by Apple and 80x24 used by some dumb terminals.  The choice of 64x16 was part in economics, part in physics and part in usability.  To support 80x24, twice as much static ram would be required (7 additional RAM chips, 9 chips total with the extra address decoding needed), plus there was no room on the board to put any extra chips. The Model I was originally intended to be used with a user supplied black-and-white television. With no color burst signal and with the RF stage skipped, a black-and-white TV easily displays up to 64 columns well, but 80 columns would create an unviewable image. With 1K of RAM address space, a maximum of 16 lines is possible. From a usability standpoint, 16 lines of 64 characters are more versatile than 24 lines of 40 characters, as 64 characters is the full width of a typewritten page (at the typical typewriter's 10 characters per inch with 1 inch page borders commonly used at the time).\n\nWith higher density RAM chips and dedicated purpose build monitors, higher resolution crisp displays are obtainable; 80x24 character displays are available in the Model II, Model 4, and later systems.\n\nThe Model I has no built-in speaker.  Square wave tones can be produced by outputting data to the cassette port and plugging an amplifier into the cassette \"Mic\" line.  Most games use this ability for sound effects. An adapter was available to use [[Atari joystick port|Atari joysticks]].{{r|williams198109}}\n\n== Peripherals ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=July 2017}}<!--many paragraphs with no citations-->\n\n=== Cassette tape drive ===\nUser data was originally stored on [[cassette tape]]. RadioShack's model CTR-41 cassette recorder was included with the US$599 package.<ref name=\"rscat1977\"/>{{rp|3\u20134}} The software-based{{r|swaine19810831}} cassette tape interface is slow and erratic;{{r|hoganm319810831}} Green described it as \"crummy ... drives users up the wall\", and the first issue of ''80 Micro'' had three articles on how to improve cassette performance.{{r|green198001}} It is sensitive to audio volume,{{r|fylstra197804}} and the computer gives only a crude indication as to whether the correct volume was set, via a blinking character on screen while data is loaded. To find the correct volume at first use, the load is started and the volume is adjusted until the TRS-80 picked up the data. Then it is halted to rewind the tape and restart the load. Users were instructed to save multiple copies of a software program file, especially if audio tape cassettes instead of certified data tape was used. Automatic gain control or indicator circuits can be constructed to improve the loading process (the owner's manual provides complete circuit diagrams for the whole machine, including the peripheral interfaces, with notes on operation).\n\nAn alternative to using tape was data transmissions from the [[BBC]]'s ''Chip Shop'' programme in the UK, which broadcast software for several different microcomputers over the radio. A special program was loaded using the conventional tape interface. Then the radio broadcast was connected to the cassette tape interface. Tandy eventually replaced the CTR-41 unit with the CTR-80 which had built-in AGC circuitry (and no volume control). This helped the situation, but tape operation is still unreliable.\n\nTRS-80 Model I computers with Level I BASIC read and wrote tapes at 250 baud (about 30 bytes per second); Level II BASIC doubles this to 500 baud (about 60 bytes per second). Some programmers wrote machine-language programs that increases the speed to up to 2,000 bits per second without a loss of reliability on their tape recorders.  With the Model III and improved electronics in the cassette interface, the standard speed increased to 1,500 baud that works quite reliably on most tape recorders.\n\nFor loading and storing data from tape, the CPU creates the sound by switching the output voltage between three states, creating crude sine wave audio.\n\nThe first version of the Model I also has a hardware problem that complicated loading programs from cassette recorders. Tandy offered a small board which was installed at a service center to correct the issue. The ROMs in later models were modified to correct this.\n\n=== Model I Expansion interface ===\nOnly the Model I uses an Expansion interface; all later models have everything integrated in the same housing.\n\nThe TRS-80 does not use the [[S-100 bus]] like other early 8080 and Z80-based computers.{{r|thomas1977}} A proprietary Expansion Interface (E/I) box, which fits under the video monitor and served as its base, was offered instead. Standard features of the E/I are a floppy disk controller, Centronics [[parallel port]] for a printer, and additional cassette connector. Optionally, an extra 16 or 32 kB of RAM can be installed and a daughterboard with an RS-232 port.<ref name=\"rsc-02\">{{cite book | year=1978 | publisher=RadioShack | title=1978 Radio Shack Tandy TRS-80 Computer Catalog RSC-02}}</ref> The 40-conductor expansion connector passes through to a card edge connector, which permits the addition of external peripherals such as an outboard hard disk drive, a voice synthesizer, or a VOXBOX voice recognition unit.<ref>{{cite web|title=Radio Shack Computer Catalog RSC-3, page 10|url=http://www.radioshackcatalogs.com/html/catalogs_extra/1979_rsc-03/hr010.html|website=Radio Shack Catalogs dot com|publisher=Tandy/RadioShack|accessdate=May 2, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Radio Shack Computer Catalog RSC-2. page 13|url=http://www.radioshackcatalogs.com/html/catalogs_extra/1978_rsc-02/h013.html|website=Radio Shack Catalogs dot com|publisher=Tandy/RadioShack|accessdate=April 26, 2007}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, printing with the Model I requires the expansion interface, but later Tandy made an alternative parallel printer interface available.\n\nThe Model I Expansion Interface is the most troublesome part of the TRS-80 Model I system. It went through several revisions. The E/I connects to the CPU/keyboard with a 6-inch ribbon cable which is unshielded against RF interference and its card edge connector tends to oxidize due to its [[base metal]] contacts. This demands periodic cleaning with a pencil eraser in order to avoid spontaneous reboots, which contributes to its \"Trash-80\" sobriquet. Aftermarket connectors plated with gold solves this problem permanently. Software developers also responded by devising a recovery method which became a standard feature of many commercial programs. They accept an \"asterisk parameter\", an asterisk (star) character typed following the program name when the program is run from the TRSDOS Ready prompt. When used following a spontaneous reboot (or an accidental reset, program crash, or exit to TRSDOS without saving data to disk), the program loads without initializing its data area(s), preserving any program data still present from the pre-reboot session. Thus, for example, if a [[VisiCalc]] user suffers a spontaneous reboot, to recover data the user enters {{key press|V|C|SPACE|\u2736}} at TRSDOS Ready, and Visicalc restores the previous computing session intact.<ref group=\"note\">The user must take care not to do anything that could cause memory to be overwritten; he should recover immediately without running any other programs before. Since programs may start automatically via the TRSDOS AUTO command, during a spontaneous reboot the user should take the precaution of holding down {{key press|ENTER}} to prevent this from happening. It takes TRSDOS some half dozen seconds to load from floppy disk; the user has this long to keep an AUTO'd program from loading. This star parameter became a standard for many software applications running on the Models III and 4; for instance LS-DOS's TED and Prosoft's Allwrite.</ref>\n\nThe power button on the E/I is difficult to operate as it is recessed so as to guard against the user accidentally hitting it and turning it off while in use. A pencil eraser or similar object is used to depress the power button and the E/I has no power LED, making it difficult to determine if it is running or not.\n\nThe expansion unit requires a second power supply, identical to the base unit power supply. An interior recess holds both supplies.\n\nThe user is instructed to power on and power off all peripherals in proper order to avoid corrupting data or potentially damaging hardware components. The manuals for the TRS-80 advise turning on the monitor first, then any peripherals attached to the E/I (if multiple disk drives are attached, the last drive on the chain is to be powered on first and work down from there), the E/I, and the computer last. When powering down, the computer is to be turned off first, followed by the monitor, E/I, and peripherals. In addition, users are instructed to remove all disks from the drives during power up or down (or else leave the drive door open to disengage the read/write head from the disk). This is because a transient electrical surge from the drive's read/write head would create a magnetic pulse that could corrupt data. This was a common problem on many early floppy drives.\n\nThe E/I displays a screen full of garbage characters on power up and unless a bootable system disk is present in Drive 0, it hangs there until the user either presses {{key press|RESET}} on the back of the computer, which causes it to attempt to boot the disk again, or {{key press|Break|Reset}} was pressed, which drops the computer into BASIC. Due to the above-mentioned problems with potentially corrupting disks, it is recommended to power up to the garbage screen with the disk drives empty, insert a system disk, and then hit {{key press|RESET}}.\n\n''InfoWorld'' compared the [[cable spaghetti]] connecting the TRS-80 Model I's various components to the snakes in ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''.{{r|hoganm319810831}} RadioShack offered a \"TRS-80 System Desk\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Radio Shack Computer Catalog RSC-2, page 10|url=http://www.radioshackcatalogs.com/html/catalogs_extra/1978_rsc-02/h019.html|website=Radio Shack Catalogs dot com|publisher=Tandy/RadioShack|accessdate=May 2, 2017}}</ref> that concealed nearly all the cabling. It can accommodate the complete computer system plus up to four floppy drives and the Quick Printer. Since the cable connecting the expansion interface carries the system bus, it is short (about 6 inches). The user has no choice but to place the E/I directly behind the computer with the monitor on top. This causes problems for a non-Tandy monitor whose case did not fit the mounting holes. Also, the friction fit of the edge connector on the already short interconnect cable makes it possible to disconnect the system bus from the CPU if either unit is bumped during operation.\n\n=== Floppy disk drives ===\nRadioShack introduced floppy drives in July 1978, about six months after the Model I went on sale. The Model I [[disk operating system]] [[TRSDOS]] was written by Randy Cook under license from RadioShack; Randy claimed to have been paid $3000 for it. The first version released to the public was a buggy v2.0.  This was quickly replaced by v2.1.<ref>{{cite web|title=Radio Shack Computer Catalog RSC-2, page 15|url=http://www.radioshackcatalogs.com/html/catalogs_extra/1978_rsc-02/h015.html|website=Radio Shack Catalogs dot com|publisher=Tandy/RadioShack|accessdate=May 2, 2017}}</ref> requires buying the Expansion Interface, which included a single-density floppy disk interface (with a formatted capacity of 85k) based on the [[Western Digital FD1771|Western Digital 1771]] single-density floppy disk controller chip. The industry standard [[Shugart Associates]] SA-400 minifloppy disk drive was used.  Four floppy drives can be daisy-chained to the Model I. The last drive in the chain is supposed to have a termination resistor installed but often it is not needed as it is integrated into later cables.<ref>{{cite web|title=Radio Shack Computer Catalog RSC-2, page 14|url=http://www.radioshackcatalogs.com/html/catalogs_extra/1978_rsc-02/h014.html|website=Radio Shack Catalogs dot com|publisher=Tandy/RadioShack|accessdate=May 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\nDemand for Model I drives greatly exceeded supply at first.{{r|green198001}} The drive is unreliable, partly since the interface lacked an external data separator (buffer).{{r|hoganm319810831}} The early version(s) of TRSDOS are also buggy, and not helped by the Western Digital FD1771 chip that cannot reliably report its status for several instruction cycles after it receives a command. A common method of handling the delay was to issue a command to the 1771, perform several \"NOP\" instructions, then query the 1771 for the result. Early TRSDOS neglects the required yet undocumented wait period, and thus false status often returns to the OS, generating random errors and crashes. Once the 1771 delay was implemented, it is fairly reliable.\n\nIn 1981, [[Steve Ciarcia]] published in ''[[BYTE]]'' the design for a homemade, improved expansion interface with additional RAM and a disk controller for the TRS-80.<ref name=\"ciarcia198102\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1981-03/1981_03_BYTE_06-03_Programming_Methods#page/n37/mode/2up | title=Build the Disk-80 / Memory Expansion and Floppy-Disk Control | work=BYTE | date=February 1982 | accessdate=October 18, 2013 | author=Ciarcia, Steve | pages=36}}</ref>\n\nA data separator and a double density disk controller (based on the WD 1791 chip) were made by [[Percom]] (a Texas peripheral vendor), LNW, Tandy and others. The Percom Doubler adds the ability to boot and use [[Double Density]] floppies using a Percom-modified TRSDOS called DoubleDOS. The LNDoubler adds the ability to read and write from 5\u00bc\" diskette drives for a total of 1.2 [[Megabyte|MB]] storage. Near the end of the Model I's lifespan in 1982, upgrades were offered to replace its original controller with a double density one.\n\nThe first disk drives offered on the Model I were Shugart SA-400s which supported 35 tracks and was the sole 5.25\" drive on the market in 1977-78. By 1979, other manufacturers began offering drives. Models 3/4/4P uses Tandon TM-100 40-track drives. The combination of 40 tracks and double-density gives a capacity of 180 kilobytes per single-sided floppy disk. The use of index-sync means that a \"[[flippy disk]]\" requires a second index hole and write-enable notch. One could purchase factory-made \"flippies\". Some software publishers formatted one side for Apple systems and the other for the TRS-80.\n\nThe usual method of connecting floppy drives involves setting the drive letter via jumper blocks on the drive controller board, but Tandy opted for a slightly more user-friendly technique where all four select pins on the drives are jumpered and the ribbon cable is missing the Drive Select line. Thus, the user does not need to worry about moving jumpers around depending on which position on the chain a drive was in.\n\nA standard flat floppy ribbon cable is usable on the Model I, in which case the drives is jumpered to their number on the chain, or even an IBM PC \"twist\" cable, which requires setting each drive number to 1, but only permits two drives on the chain.\n\nAlthough third party DOSes allow the user to define virtually any floppy format wanted, the \"lowest common denominator\" format for TRS-80s is the baseline single density, single sided, 35-40 track format of the Model I.\n\nThird-party vendors like Aerocomp made available double-sided and 80 track 5-1/4 inch and later 3-1/2 inch floppy drives with up to 720 KB of storage each. These new drives are half-height and therefore require different or modified drive housings.\n\n=== Exatron Stringy Floppy ===\nAn alternative to cassette tape and floppy disk storage was provided by [[Exatron]]. The device is a continuous loop tape drive, dubbed the [[Exatron Stringy Floppy|\"stringy floppy\"]] or ESF. It requires no Expansion Interface, plugging directly into the TRS-80's 40-pin expansion bus, is much less expensive than a floppy drive, can read and write random-access data like a floppy drive unlike a cassette tape, and it transfers data at up to 14,400 [[baud]]. Exatron tape cartridges store over 64 KB of data. The ESF can coexist with the TRS-80 data cassette drive. It was popular with TRS-80 enthusiasts, selling over 4,000 units by 1981. Exatron also made a complementary RAM expansion board that installed in the TRS-80 keyboard to increase memory to 48 KB without the EI.<ref name=\"lundell19810831X\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rD0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA47&lpg=PA47&dq=%22stringy+floppy+from+exatron%22&source=bl&ots=aQTZ-jAvMe&sig=ZuddZf8Qe3JgewbO4LPR0hWuu_c&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi4wf-ojdLTAhWB4iYKHYkyAb8Q6AEIOjAE#v=onepage&q=%22stringy%20floppy%20from%20exatron%22&f=false | title=Stringy Floppy from Exatron | work=InfoWorld | date=August 31, 1981 | accessdate=February 15, 2015 | author=Lundell, Allan | pages=47\u201348}}</ref>\n\n=== Hard drive ===\nRadioShack introduced a 5 MB external hard disk for the TRS-80 Model III/4 in 1983. It is the same hard disk unit offered for the Model II line, but came with OS software for Model III/4. An adapter is required to connect it to the Model I's E/I.<ref>{{cite web|title=Radio Shack Computer Catalog RSC-8, page 52|url=http://www.radioshackcatalogs.com/html/catalogs_extra/1983_rsc-08/h052.html|website=Radio Shack Catalogs dot com|publisher=Tandy/RadioShack|accessdate=May 2, 2017}}</ref> The unit is about the same size as a modern desktop computer enclosure. Up to four hard disks can be daisychained for 20 MB of storage. The [[LDOS (operating system)|LDOS]] operating system by [[Logical Systems]] was bundled, which provides utilities for managing the storage space and flexible backup. The initial retail price for the first (primary) unit (US$2495) is equivalent to US${{Inflation|US|2495|1983|r=-2}} in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}. Later, a 15MB hard disk was offered in a white case, which can be daisychained for up to 60 MB. Like most hard disks used on 8-bit machines, there is no provision for subdirectories, but the DiskDISK utility is a useful alternative that creates virtual hard disk \".DSK\" files that can be mounted as another disk drive, and used like a subdirectory would.  To display the directory/contents of an unmounted DiskDISK virtual disk file, a shareware DDIR \"Virtual Disk Directory Utility\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=McKay |first1=Bryan |title=DDIR read-me |date=Jan 2, 1986 |page=1}}</ref> program was commonly used.\n\n=== Printers ===\nThe \"Quick Printer\",<ref>{{cite web|title=Radio Shack Computer Catalog RSC-2, page 16|url=http://www.radioshackcatalogs.com/html/catalogs_extra/1978_rsc-02/h016.html|website=Radio Shack Catalogs dot com|publisher=Tandy/RadioShack|accessdate=May 2, 2017}}</ref> is an electrostatic rotary printer that scans the video memory through the bus connector, and prints an image of the screen onto aluminum-coated paper in about one second. Unfortunately, it is incompatible with both the final, buffered version of the expansion interface, and with the \"heartbeat\" interrupt used for the real-time clock under Disk BASIC. This can be overcome by using special cabling, and by doing a \"dummy\" write to the cassette port while triggering the printer.\n\nTwo 3rd party printers were for 57&nbsp;mm metal coated paper, selling for approximately DM 600 in Germany, and a [[dot-matrix printer]] built by [[Centronics]] for normal paper, costing at first DM 3000, later sold at approximately DM 1500 in some stores. It has only 7 pins, so letters with descenders such as lowercase \"g\" do not reach under the baseline, but are elevated within the normal line.\n\nRadioShack offered an extensive line of printers for the TRS-80 family, ranging from basic 9-pin dot matrix units to large wide-carriage line printers for professional use, daisy-wheel printers, ink jet printers, laser printers and color plotters. All have a Centronics-standard interface and after the introduction of the [[TRS-80 Color Computer|Color Computer]] in 1980, many also had a connector for the CoCo's serial interface.\n\nFP-215 is a flatbed [[plotter]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/human39/fp-215-plotter|title=GitHub - human39/fp-215-plotter: Radio Shack TRS-80 FP-215 Flatbed Plotter Info|date=August 11, 2019|via=GitHub}}</ref>\n\n== Software ==\n=== BASIC ===\nThree versions of the [[BASIC]] programming language were produced for the Model I. ''[[Level I BASIC]]'' fits in 4 KB of [[read-only memory|ROM]], and ''Level II BASIC'' fits into 12 KB of ROM. Level I is single precision only and had a smaller set of commands. Level II introduced double precision floating point support and has a much wider set of commands. Level II was further enhanced when a disk system was added, allowing for the loading of ''Disk BASIC''.{{r|thomas1977}}\n\nLevel I BASIC is based on [[Li-Chen Wang]]'s free [[Tiny BASIC]] with some additional functions added by RadioShack.{{r|leininger19770917}} It has an excellent manual{{r|thomas1977}}{{r|yeager197908}}{{r|archer198310}}\u2014the ''User's Manual for Level 1'' by [[David A. Lien]]\u2014which presents lessons on programming with text and humorous cartoons, making the subjects very easy to understand. Lien wrote that it was \"written specifically for people who don't know anything about computers ... I want you to have fun with your computer! I don't want you to be afraid of it, because there is nothing to fear\".<ref name=\"lien1977\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/Level_1_Users_Manual_1977_David_Lien#page/n0/mode/2up |title=User's Manual for Level 1 |last=Lien |first=David A. |date=1978 |page=1}}</ref>{{r|fylstra197804}} Level I BASIC has only two [[string (computer science)|string]] variables (<code>A$</code> and <code>B$</code>), 26 numeric variables (<code>A</code> \u2013 <code>Z</code>), and one array, <code>A()</code>. Code for functions like SIN(), COS() and TAN() is not included in ROM but printed at the end of the book. The only error messages are \"<code>WHAT?</code>\" for syntax errors, \"<code>HOW?</code>\" for arithmetic errors such as [[division by zero]], and \"<code>SORRY</code>\" for [[out of memory]] errors.\n\nLevel I BASIC is not [[tokenized]]; reserved words are stored literally. In order to maximize the code that fits into 4K of memory, users can enter abbreviations for reserved words. For example, writing \"<code>P.</code>\" instead of \"<code>PRINT</code>\" saves 3 bytes.\n\nLevel II BASIC, introduced in mid-1978, was licensed from [[Microsoft]] and is required to use the expansion bus and disk drives. RadioShack always intended for Level I BASIC to be a stopgap until Level II was ready, and the first brochure for the Model I in January 1978 mentioned that Level II BASIC was \"coming soon\". It is an abridged version of the 16k [[Microsoft BASIC|Extended BASIC]], since the Model I has 12k of ROM space. According to [[Bill Gates]], \"It was a sort of intermediate between 8k BASIC and Extended BASIC. Some features from Extended BASIC such as descriptive errors and user defined functions were not included, but there were double precision variables and the PRINT USING statement that we wanted to get in. The entire development of Level II BASIC took about four weeks from start to finish.\" The accompanying manual is more terse and technical than the Level I manual. Original Level I BASIC-equipped machines could be retrofitted to Level II through a ROM replacement performed by RadioShack for a fee (originally $199). Users with Level I BASIC programs stored on cassette have to convert these to the tokenized Level II BASIC before use.

Numerous alternative DOSes appeared, the most prominent being [[Logical Disk Operating System|LDOS]] because Radio Shack licensed it from Logical Systems and adopted it as its official DOS for its Models I and III hard disk drive products. Other alternative TRS-80 DOSes included [[NewDos/80|NewDOS]] from Apparat Personal Computers, and [[DoubleDOS]], [[DOSPlus]], [[MicroDOS]], [[UltraDOS]] (later called Multidos). The DOS for the Model 4 line was originally called TRSDOS Version 6 but was actually produced by and licensed from Logical Systems, and is technically a descendant of the original Model I LDOS.\n\nThe memory map of the Model I and III render them incompatible with the standard [[CP/M]] OS for Z80 business computers, which loads at [[hexadecimal]] address $0000 with TPA ([[Transient Program Area]]) starting at $0100; the TRS-80 ROM resides in this address space.

The computer's CPU board has three banks of sockets (8 sockets to a bank) which take type 4116 DRAMs, so memory configurations come in 16KB, 32KB, or 48KB RAM memory sizes. Computers with 32K or 48K RAM can be upgraded with floppy disk drive storage. There is space inside the computer cabinet for two full-height drives. Those offered by Tandy/RadioShack are single-sided, 40 track, double-density (MFM encoding) for 180K of storage. Third-party suppliers offered double-sided and 80-track drives, though to control them they had to modify the TRSDOS driver code or else furnish an alternative third-party DOS which could (see below). The installation of floppy disk drives also requires the computer's power supply to be upgraded. There is no internal cooling fan in the Model III; it uses passive convection cooling (unless an unusual number of power-hungry expansions were installed internally, such as a hard disk drive, graphics board, speedup kit, RS-232 board, etc.).\n\nTandy claimed that the Model III was compatible with 80% of Model I software.{{r|freiberger19810831}} Many software publishers issued patches to permit their Model I programs to run on the Model III. Marketing director Ed Juge explained that their designers considered changing from the Model I's 64 column by 16 row video screen layout, but that they ultimately decided that maintaining compatibility was most important.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Juge |first1=Ed |title=80 Micro, January 1980, pages 10-11, \"Inside 80\" |url=https://archive.org/details/80-microcomputing-magazine-1980-09/page/n9 |website=archive dot org |publisher=CW Communications |accessdate=May 22, 2019|date=September 1980 }}</ref>\n\nThe Model III's memory map and system architecture is mostly the same as the Model I, but the disk drives and printer port were moved from memory mapped to port I/O, thus Model I software that attempts to manipulate the disk controller directly or output to the printer (in particular Model I DOSes and application packages such as Visicalc and Scripsit) will not work. Under the supplied TRSDOS 1.3 operating system Model I disks can be read in the Model III, but not vice versa.{{r|hogan19810831}} The optional LDOS OS (by Logical Systems Inc.) use a common disk format for both Model I and Model III versions.\n\nCustomers and developers complained of bugs in the Model III's Microsoft BASIC interpreter and TRSDOS.<ref name=\"freiberger19810831\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rD0EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA44&pg=PA49#v=onepage&f=false | title=Bugs in Radio Shack TRS-80 Model III: How Bad Are They? | accessdate=February 28, 2011 | author=Freiberger, Paul | date=August 31, 1981 | work=InfoWorld | page=49}}</ref> Tandy/RadioShack (and TRS-80 magazines like ''[[80 Micro]]'') periodically published many software patches to correct these deficiencies and to permit users to customize the software to their preferences.\n\nDifferences in the WD1771 and WD1791 floppy controllers created problems reading Model I disks on a Model III (the double density upgrade in the Model I include both chips while a Model III had only the WD1791). The WD1771 supports four data markers while the WD1791 only supports two, and some versions of TRSDOS for the Model I also use them. In addition, they are used by copy protection schemes. Software was available to allow Model I disks to be read on a Model III. The WD1791 supports the 500 bit/s bitrate needed for high density floppy drives, but the controller is not capable of using them without extensive modifications.\n\nTRSDOS for the Model III was developed in-house by Radio Shack rather than being contracted out like the Model I's DOS. None of the code base from Model I DOS was reused and the Model III DOS was rewritten from scratch; this also created some compatibility issues since the Model III DOS's API was not entirely identical to the Model I DOS. This was primarily to avoid legal disputes with Randy Cook over ownership of the code as had occurred with Model I DOS and also because Radio Shack originally planned several features for the Model III such as 80 column text support that were not included. Two early versions, 1.1 and 1.2, were replaced by version 1.3 in 1981 which became the standard Model III OS. TRSDOS 1.3 is not format compatible with 1.1 and 1.2; a utility called XFERSYS is provided which converted older format disks to TRSDOS 1.3 format (this change is permanent and the resultant disks cannot be read with the older DOS versions).\n\nThe Model III's boot screen was cleaned up from the Model I. Instead of displaying garbage on screen at power up, it displays a \"Diskette?\" prompt if a bootable floppy is not detected. The user can insert a disk and press any key to boot. On powerup or reset holding down the {{key press|Break}} key will boot the computer into ROM-based Level II BASIC. This capability is useful if the disk drive is not functioning and cannot boot a TRSDOS disk (or if a boot disk is not available); it permits an operator familiar with the machine hardware to perform diagnostics using BASIC's PEEK and POKE commands. This works for the Model 4 as well, but not for the 4P.\n\nWhile Model I DOS is fairly flexible in its capabilities, Model III DOS is hard coded to only support 180K single sided floppies, a problem fixed by the many third party DOSes. To that end, when Radio Shack introduced hard disks for the TRS-80 line in 1982, the company licensed LDOS rather than attempt to modify Model III DOS for hard disk support.\n\nLevel II BASIC on the Model III is 16K in size and incorporates a few features from Level I Disk BASIC\n\nTRSDOS 1.3 was given a few more minor updates, the last being in 1984, although the version number was unchanged. This includes at least one update that writes an Easter Egg message \"Joe, you rummy buzzard\" on an unused disk sector, which is reputedly a joke message left by a programmer in a beta version, but accidentally included in the production master.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.trs-80.org/trsdos-rummy-buzzard-release/|title=The TRSDOS \"rummy buzzard\" release|website=www.trs-80.org}}</ref>\n\nThe Model III keyboard lacks {{key press|CONTROL}}. Many application programs use {{key press|@}}, while others use {{key press|SHIFT|Up}}. Often {{key press|CLEAR}} is used in combination with number and alpha keys. The Model III keyboard also lacks {{key press|CAPS LOCK}}; to caps-lock the alpha keys the user presses {{key press|SHIFT|0}}. Under LDOS [[typeahead]] is supported.\n\nBecause TRSDOS 1.3 was found wanting by many users, Tandy offered (at additional cost) Logical System's LDOS Version 5 as an alternative. As with the Model I, other third-party sources also offered TRSDOS alternatives for the Model III, including NewDOS, Alphabit's MultiDOS, and Micro Systems Software's DOSPlus. These are compatible with TRSDOS 1.3 and ran the same applications programs, but offer improved command structures, more and better system utilities, and enhancements to the Microsoft BASIC interpreter. After writing the original Model I TRSDOS, Randy Cook began work on his own DOS, titled VTOS, which was superseded by LDOS and also created some frustration for users as it is the only TRS-80 DOS to be copy protected.\n\nAlthough mostly intended as a disk-based computer, the Model III was available in a base cassette configuration with no disk hardware and only 16K of RAM with Level II BASIC. Radio Shack also offered a 4K version with Level I BASIC, identical to Model I Level I BASIC, but with the addition of LPRINT and LLIST commands for printer output. Upgrading to a disk machine necessitate installing at least 32K of RAM, the disk controller board, and an additional power supply for the disk drives. Disk upgrades purchased from Radio Shack included TRSDOS 1.3; users upgrading from third-party vendors had to purchase DOS separately (most opted for LDOS or DOSPlus), though a great many Model III applications programs included a licensed copy of TRSDOS 1.3.\n\nAs with the Model I's E/I, the RS-232C port on the Model III was an extra cost option and not included in the base price of the computer, though the dual disk Model III for $2495 included the serial port.\n\nLike the Model I, the Model III sold well in the educational market. Many school administrators valued the Model III's all-in-one hardware design because it made it more difficult for students to steal components.{{r|white198708}} ''InfoWorld'' approved of the Model III's single-unit design, simplified cable management, and improvements such as lack of keyboard bounce and improved disk reliability. The reviewer, a former Model I owner, stated \"I'm impressed\" and that \"had the Model III been available, it's probable that I wouldn't have sold it\". He concluded, \"If you're looking for a computer that's not too expensive but that performs well, you would be wise to test the Model III\u2014you might end up buying it.\"{{r|hoganm319810831}}\n\nDon French, who had left Radio Shack to found FMG Software after designing the Model I, expressed his disappointment in the new machine while trying to convert CP/M to run on it. \"I've encountered numerous problems with the floppy drive and its interface. Radio Shack will sell a Model III to anyone. They're trying to market it as a business computer when the existing software is woefully inadequate. 48K just isn't enough. You run out of memory before you get going. They're selling a medical package that takes up nine disks. I think the Model III is a very poorly conceived machine\".{{r|freiberger19810831}}\n\n==== Aftermarket products ====\nAftermarket hardware were offered by Tandy/RadioShack and many third-party manufacturers. The usual selection of add-ons and peripherals available for the Model I were offered: outboard floppy drives (one or two could be plugged into a card-edge connector on the back panel), an outboard hard disk drive (LDOS was furnished as Tandy's hard drive OS vice TRSDOS), a high-resolution graphics board<ref>{{cite web|title=1983 Radio Shack Computer Catalog RSC-8, page 52|url=http://www.radioshackcatalogs.com/html/catalogs_extra/1983_rsc-08/hr052.html|website=radioshackcatalogs dot com|publisher=Tandy/RadioShack|accessdate=April 26, 2017}}</ref> (resolution 512 by 192 pixels),<ref group=\"note\">The Radio Shack catalog entry advertises 640x240 resolution, but this is a misprint</ref> an RS-232C serial port on an internal circuit card, and a parallel printer (connected by a card-edge connector).

The Orch-90 was licensed from a company called Software Affair, which also produced the Model I-compatible Orchestra-85 from 1981.\n\nA number of third-party manufacturers specialized in upgrading Model IIIs with high performance hardware and software, and remarketing them under their own labels.<ref>{{cite web |title=80 Micro magazine, April 1983, pages 81-94, \"The Muscle Micros, These Three Sleek Supercharged Model IIIs...\" |url=https://archive.org/details/80-microcomputing-magazine-1983-04/page/n81 |website=archive dot org |publisher=80 Micro |accessdate=May 22, 2019|date=April 1983 }}</ref><ref group=\"note\">It was necessary to rebrand these highly modified Model IIIs because Radio Shack enforced a strict policy that no repair service would be performed on nonstandard RS products.</ref> The improvements typically included internal hard disk drives, greater capacity floppy drives, 4 MHz Z80 speedup kits, professional grade green or amber CRT video displays, better DOS software (typically DOSPlus by Micro Systems Software or LDOS by Logical Systems) including the all-important hard drive backup utilities, and custom menu-driven shell interfaces which insulated non-expert users (business employees) from the DOS command line. These were touted as high productivity turnkey systems for small businesses at less cost than competing business systems from higher-end providers such as IBM and DEC, as well as Radio Shack's own [[TRS-80 Model II]].\n\n==== Models III/4 compatibility ====\nRadioShack suffered much criticism for incomplete compatibility between the Models I and III, so made a special effort to ensure that the Model III's successor would run all of its software. The Model 4 included all of the Model III's hardware, port assignments and operating modes, and thus is virtually one hundred percent compatible down to the machine level.\n\nModel III programs running on a Model 4 can access the Model 4's additional hardware features (like 4 MHz clock rate, bigger video screen and keyboard, banked RAM above 64 KB) by manipulating its machine ports.

It has a slot for an internal modem card and could emulate a Model III.\n\nThe Model 4D with bundled Deskmate productivity suite was introduced in early 1985. It has a revised CPU board using faster gate array logic which includes the floppy controller and RS-232C circuitry, all on a single board. The computer has two internal double-sided diskette drives, and is the last model descended from the 1977 Model I. It retailed for $1199 at its introduction in 1985.

Among the Tandy employees who purchased a [[MITS Altair]] [[kit computer]] was [[purchasing agent|buyer]] Don French, who began designing his own computer and showed it to vice president of manufacturing John Roach, Tandy's former [[electronic data processing]] manager. Although the design did not impress Roach, the idea of selling a microcomputer did. When the two men visited [[National Semiconductor]] in California in mid-1976, [[Homebrew Computer Club]] member Steve Leininger's expertise on the [[SC/MP]] microprocessor impressed them. National executives refused to provide Leininger's contact information when French and Roach wanted to hire him as a consultant, but they found Leininger working part-time at [[Byte Shop]]. Leininger was unhappy at National, his wife wanted a better job, and Texas did not have a [[state income tax]]. Hiring him for his technical and retail experience, Leininger and French began working together in June 1976. The company envisioned a kit, but Leininger persuaded the others that because \"too many people can't solder\", a preassembled computer would be better.<ref name=\"swaine19810831\"/>{{r|thomas1977}}{{r|white198708}}{{r|reed1}}\n\nTandy had 11 million customers that might buy a microcomputer, but it would be much more expensive than the {{US$|30}} median price of a RadioShack product, and a great risk for the very conservative company.<ref name=\"reed1\">{{cite web | url=http://www.trs-80.org/trs80-introduction-part1/ | title=The Introduction of the TRS\u201180 (Part 1) | publisher=TRS-80.org | accessdate=January 23, 2015 | author=Reed, Matthew}}</ref>{{r|white198708}} Executives feared losing money as [[Sears]] did with [[Cartrivision]],<ref name=\"leininger19770917\">{{cite conference | url=http://www.trs-80.com/trs80-models-model1.htm | title=TRS-80 architect reminisces about design project | accessdate=February 28, 2011 | author=Leininger, Steven W. |date=September 1977 | conference=San Diego Computer Society}}</ref> and many opposed the project; one executive told French, \"Don't waste my time\u2014we can't sell computers.\" As the popularity of [[Citizens band radio|CB radio]]\u2014at one point comprising more than 20% of RadioShack's sales\u2014declined, however, the company sought new products. In December 1976 French and Leininger received official approval for the project but were told to emphasize cost savings; for example, leaving out lowercase characters saved US$1.50 in components and reduced the retail price by {{US$|5}}. The original {{US$|199}} retail price required [[manufacturing cost]] of {{US$|80}}; the first design had a [[membrane keyboard]] and no video monitor. Leininger persuaded Roach and French to include a better keyboard; it, a monitor, [[datacassette]] storage, and other features required a higher retail price to provide Tandy's typical profit margin. In February 1977 they showed their prototype, running a simple tax-accounting program, to [[Charles Tandy]], head of Tandy Corporation. The program quickly crashed as the computer could not handle the {{US$|150,000}} figure that Tandy typed in as his salary, and the two men added support for [[floating-point math]] to its [[Tiny BASIC]] to prevent a recurrence. The project was formally approved on 2 February 1977; Tandy revealed that he had already leaked the computer's existence to the press. When first inspecting the prototype, he remarked that even if it did not sell, the project could be worthy if only for the publicity it might generate.{{r|ahl198411}}<ref name=\"white198708\">{{Cite magazine |last=White |first=Ron |date=August 1987 |title=The Tandy Story: It all started 10 years ago in a converted used-car showroom... |url=https://archive.org/details/80-microcomputing-magazine-1987-08/page/n51 |magazine=80 Micro |pages=50\u201364 |access-date=2019-05-18}}</ref>{{r|reed1}}\n\nMITS sold 1,000 Altairs in February 1975, and was selling 10,000 a year.

Tandy's {{code|KBFIX}} utility, the Model III, the last Model I firmware, and most third-party operating systems also implement the software fix, and Tandy changed the keyboard during the Model III's lifetime to an [[Alps Electric]] design with sealed switches. The Alps keyboard was available as an upgrade for the Model I for $79.{{r|reedkeybounce}}\n\nThe keyboard is [[memory mapped I/O|memory mapped]] so that certain locations in the processor's memory space correspond to the status of a group of keys.\n\n=== Video and audio===\n[[File:TRS-80-graphics.svg|thumb|Layout of characters and pixels on the TRS-80 display|300px]]\nThe color of the 12\" KCS 172 RCA monitor's{{r|white198708}} text is faintly blue (the standard P4 [[phosphor]] used in black-and white televisions). Green and amber filters, or replacement tubes to reduce [[eye fatigue]] were popular aftermarket items. Later models came with a green-on-black display.\n\nComplaints about the video display quality were common. As Green wrote, \"hells bells, [the monitor] ''is'' a cheap black and white television set with a bit of conversion for computer use\".{{r|green198001}} (The computer could be purchased without the RadioShack monitor.)<ref name=\"fylstra197804\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1978-04/1978_04_BYTE_03-04_Optimization#page/n49/mode/2up | title=The Radio Shack TRS-80: An Owner's Report | work=BYTE | date=April 1978 | accessdate=October 17, 2013 | author=Fylstra, Dan | pages=49}}</ref> CPU access to the screen memory causes visible [[flicker (screen)|flicker]]. The bus arbitration logic blocks video display refresh (video RAM reads) during [[central processing unit|CPU]] writes to the VRAM, causing a short black line. This has little effect on normal BASIC programs, but fast programs made with [[assembly language]] can be affected. Software authors worked to minimize the effect, and many arcade-style [[List of TRS-80 games|games]] are available for the Tandy TRS-80.\n\nBecause of bandwidth problems in the interface card that replaced the TV's tuner, the display loses horizontal sync if large areas of white are displayed. A simple half-hour hardware fix corrects the problem.\n\nLike the Apple II, an unmodified Model I cannot display lowercase letters. The standard character generator has 64 graphics symbols and 64 upper case alphanumeric symbols. The video RAM uses 2102 SRAM chips, which are 1Kb x 1, but the PCB has seven installed, allowing only 128 characters (graphic or alphanumeric) to be displayed (0 to 127). Leaving out an eighth chip saved $1 in manufacturing costs, which would have increased the purchase price of the computer. By installing an eighth 2102 (done by piggybacking it onto chip #7), it is possible to display all 256 characters (which includes lowercase letters).  The 1978 manual for the popular word processor [[Electric Pencil]] came with instructions for modifying the computer. Although the modification needs to be disabled for Level II BASIC, its design became the industry standard and was widely sold in kit form,<ref name=\"reedlc\">{{cite web | url=http://www.trs-80.org/electric-pencil-lowercase-modification/ | title=The Electric Pencil Lower Case Modification | accessdate=27 February 2016 | author=Reed, Matthew}}</ref> along with an eighth 2102 chip with [[descender]]s for the lowercase letters. Later models came with the hardware for the lowercase character set to be displayed with descenders.\n\nSince there is only 1k of video RAM, the Model I's display has 64x16 characters instead of the more common 40x25 or 80x25.\nBoth 64x16 and 32x16 video modes are supported, which is in contrast to 40x25 used by Apple and 80x24 used by some dumb terminals.  The choice of 64x16 was part in economics, part in physics and part in usability.  To support 80x24, twice as much static ram would be required (7 additional RAM chips, 9 chips total with the extra address decoding needed), plus there was no room on the board to put any extra chips. The Model I was originally intended to be used with a user supplied black-and-white television. With no color burst signal and with the RF stage skipped, a black-and-white TV easily displays up to 64 columns well, but 80 columns would create an unviewable image. With 1K of RAM address space, a maximum of 16 lines is possible. From a usability standpoint, 16 lines of 64 characters are more versatile than 24 lines of 40 characters, as 64 characters is the full width of a typewritten page (at the typical typewriter's 10 characters per inch with 1 inch page borders commonly used at the time).\n\nWith higher density RAM chips and dedicated purpose build monitors, higher resolution crisp displays are obtainable; 80x24 character displays are available in the Model II, Model 4, and later systems.\n\nThe Model I has no built-in speaker.  Square wave tones can be produced by outputting data to the cassette port and plugging an amplifier into the cassette \"Mic\" line.  Most games use this ability for sound effects. An adapter was available to use [[Atari joystick port|Atari joysticks]].{{r|williams198109}}\n\n== Peripherals ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=July 2017}}<!--many paragraphs with no citations-->\n\n=== Cassette tape drive ===\nUser data was originally stored on [[cassette tape]]. RadioShack's model CTR-41 cassette recorder was included with the US$599 package.<ref name=\"rscat1977\"/>{{rp|3\u20134}} The software-based{{r|swaine19810831}} cassette tape interface is slow and erratic;{{r|hoganm319810831}} Green described it as \"crummy ... drives users up the wall\", and the first issue of ''80 Micro'' had three articles on how to improve cassette performance.{{r|green198001}} It is sensitive to audio volume,{{r|fylstra197804}} and the computer gives only a crude indication as to whether the correct volume was set, via a blinking character on screen while data is loaded. To find the correct volume at first use, the load is started and the volume is adjusted until the TRS-80 picked up the data. Then it is halted to rewind the tape and restart the load. Users were instructed to save multiple copies of a software program file, especially if audio tape cassettes instead of certified data tape was used. Automatic gain control or indicator circuits can be constructed to improve the loading process (the owner's manual provides complete circuit diagrams for the whole machine, including the peripheral interfaces, with notes on operation).\n\nAn alternative to using tape was data transmissions from the [[BBC]]'s ''Chip Shop'' programme in the UK, which broadcast software for several different microcomputers over the radio. A special program was loaded using the conventional tape interface. Then the radio broadcast was connected to the cassette tape interface. Tandy eventually replaced the CTR-41 unit with the CTR-80 which had built-in AGC circuitry (and no volume control). This helped the situation, but tape operation is still unreliable.\n\nTRS-80 Model I computers with Level I BASIC read and wrote tapes at 250 baud (about 30 bytes per second); Level II BASIC doubles this to 500 baud (about 60 bytes per second). Some programmers wrote machine-language programs that increases the speed to up to 2,000 bits per second without a loss of reliability on their tape recorders.  With the Model III and improved electronics in the cassette interface, the standard speed increased to 1,500 baud that works quite reliably on most tape recorders.\n\nFor loading and storing data from tape, the CPU creates the sound by switching the output voltage between three states, creating crude sine wave audio.\n\nThe first version of the Model I also has a hardware problem that complicated loading programs from cassette recorders. Tandy offered a small board which was installed at a service center to correct the issue. The ROMs in later models were modified to correct this.\n\n=== Model I Expansion interface ===\nOnly the Model I uses an Expansion interface; all later models have everything integrated in the same housing.\n\nThe TRS-80 does not use the [[S-100 bus]] like other early 8080 and Z80-based computers.{{r|thomas1977}} A proprietary Expansion Interface (E/I) box, which fits under the video monitor and served as its base, was offered instead. Standard features of the E/I are a floppy disk controller, Centronics [[parallel port]] for a printer, and additional cassette connector. Optionally, an extra 16 or 32 kB of RAM can be installed and a daughterboard with an RS-232 port.<ref name=\"rsc-02\">{{cite book | year=1978 | publisher=RadioShack | title=1978 Radio Shack Tandy TRS-80 Computer Catalog RSC-02}}</ref> The 40-conductor expansion connector passes through to a card edge connector, which permits the addition of external peripherals such as an outboard hard disk drive, a voice synthesizer, or a VOXBOX voice recognition unit.<ref>{{cite web|title=Radio Shack Computer Catalog RSC-3, page 10|url=http://www.radioshackcatalogs.com/html/catalogs_extra/1979_rsc-03/hr010.html|website=Radio Shack Catalogs dot com|publisher=Tandy/RadioShack|accessdate=May 2, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Radio Shack Computer Catalog RSC-2. page 13|url=http://www.radioshackcatalogs.com/html/catalogs_extra/1978_rsc-02/h013.html|website=Radio Shack Catalogs dot com|publisher=Tandy/RadioShack|accessdate=April 26, 2007}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, printing with the Model I requires the expansion interface, but later Tandy made an alternative parallel printer interface available.\n\nThe Model I Expansion Interface is the most troublesome part of the TRS-80 Model I system. It went through several revisions. The E/I connects to the CPU/keyboard with a 6-inch ribbon cable which is unshielded against RF interference and its card edge connector tends to oxidize due to its [[base metal]] contacts. This demands periodic cleaning with a pencil eraser in order to avoid spontaneous reboots, which contributes to its \"Trash-80\" sobriquet. Aftermarket connectors plated with gold solves this problem permanently. Software developers also responded by devising a recovery method which became a standard feature of many commercial programs. They accept an \"asterisk parameter\", an asterisk (star) character typed following the program name when the program is run from the TRSDOS Ready prompt. When used following a spontaneous reboot (or an accidental reset, program crash, or exit to TRSDOS without saving data to disk), the program loads without initializing its data area(s), preserving any program data still present from the pre-reboot session. Thus, for example, if a [[VisiCalc]] user suffers a spontaneous reboot, to recover data the user enters {{key press|V|C|SPACE|\u2736}} at TRSDOS Ready, and Visicalc restores the previous computing session intact.<ref group=\"note\">The user must take care not to do anything that could cause memory to be overwritten; he should recover immediately without running any other programs before. Since programs may start automatically via the TRSDOS AUTO command, during a spontaneous reboot the user should take the precaution of holding down {{key press|ENTER}} to prevent this from happening. It takes TRSDOS some half dozen seconds to load from floppy disk; the user has this long to keep an AUTO'd program from loading. This star parameter became a standard for many software applications running on the Models III and 4; for instance LS-DOS's TED and Prosoft's Allwrite.</ref>\n\nThe power button on the E/I is difficult to operate as it is recessed so as to guard against the user accidentally hitting it and turning it off while in use. A pencil eraser or similar object is used to depress the power button and the E/I has no power LED, making it difficult to determine if it is running or not.\n\nThe expansion unit requires a second power supply, identical to the base unit power supply. An interior recess holds both supplies.\n\nThe user is instructed to power on and power off all peripherals in proper order to avoid corrupting data or potentially damaging hardware components. The manuals for the TRS-80 advise turning on the monitor first, then any peripherals attached to the E/I (if multiple disk drives are attached, the last drive on the chain is to be powered on first and work down from there), the E/I, and the computer last. When powering down, the computer is to be turned off first, followed by the monitor, E/I, and peripherals. In addition, users are instructed to remove all disks from the drives during power up or down (or else leave the drive door open to disengage the read/write head from the disk). This is because a transient electrical surge from the drive's read/write head would create a magnetic pulse that could corrupt data. This was a common problem on many early floppy drives.\n\nThe E/I displays a screen full of garbage characters on power up and unless a bootable system disk is present in Drive 0, it hangs there until the user either presses {{key press|RESET}} on the back of the computer, which causes it to attempt to boot the disk again, or {{key press|Break|Reset}} was pressed, which drops the computer into BASIC. Due to the above-mentioned problems with potentially corrupting disks, it is recommended to power up to the garbage screen with the disk drives empty, insert a system disk, and then hit {{key press|RESET}}.\n\n''InfoWorld'' compared the [[cable spaghetti]] connecting the TRS-80 Model I's various components to the snakes in ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''.{{r|hoganm319810831}} RadioShack offered a \"TRS-80 System Desk\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Radio Shack Computer Catalog RSC-2, page 10|url=http://www.radioshackcatalogs.com/html/catalogs_extra/1978_rsc-02/h019.html|website=Radio Shack Catalogs dot com|publisher=Tandy/RadioShack|accessdate=May 2, 2017}}</ref> that concealed nearly all the cabling. It can accommodate the complete computer system plus up to four floppy drives and the Quick Printer. Since the cable connecting the expansion interface carries the system bus, it is short (about 6 inches). The user has no choice but to place the E/I directly behind the computer with the monitor on top. This causes problems for a non-Tandy monitor whose case did not fit the mounting holes. Also, the friction fit of the edge connector on the already short interconnect cable makes it possible to disconnect the system bus from the CPU if either unit is bumped during operation.\n\n=== Floppy disk drives ===\nRadioShack introduced floppy drives in July 1978, about six months after the Model I went on sale. The Model I [[disk operating system]] [[TRSDOS]] was written by Randy Cook under license from RadioShack; Randy claimed to have been paid $3000 for it. The first version released to the public was a buggy v2.0.  This was quickly replaced by v2.1.<ref>{{cite web|title=Radio Shack Computer Catalog RSC-2, page 15|url=http://www.radioshackcatalogs.com/html/catalogs_extra/1978_rsc-02/h015.html|website=Radio Shack Catalogs dot com|publisher=Tandy/RadioShack|accessdate=May 2, 2017}}</ref> requires buying the Expansion Interface, which included a single-density floppy disk interface (with a formatted capacity of 85k) based on the [[Western Digital FD1771|Western Digital 1771]] single-density floppy disk controller chip. The industry standard [[Shugart Associates]] SA-400 minifloppy disk drive was used.  Four floppy drives can be daisy-chained to the Model I. The last drive in the chain is supposed to have a termination resistor installed but often it is not needed as it is integrated into later cables.<ref>{{cite web|title=Radio Shack Computer Catalog RSC-2, page 14|url=http://www.radioshackcatalogs.com/html/catalogs_extra/1978_rsc-02/h014.html|website=Radio Shack Catalogs dot com|publisher=Tandy/RadioShack|accessdate=May 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\nDemand for Model I drives greatly exceeded supply at first.{{r|green198001}} The drive is unreliable, partly since the interface lacked an external data separator (buffer).{{r|hoganm319810831}} The early version(s) of TRSDOS are also buggy, and not helped by the Western Digital FD1771 chip that cannot reliably report its status for several instruction cycles after it receives a command. A common method of handling the delay was to issue a command to the 1771, perform several \"NOP\" instructions, then query the 1771 for the result. Early TRSDOS neglects the required yet undocumented wait period, and thus false status often returns to the OS, generating random errors and crashes. Once the 1771 delay was implemented, it is fairly reliable.\n\nIn 1981, [[Steve Ciarcia]] published in ''[[BYTE]]'' the design for a homemade, improved expansion interface with additional RAM and a disk controller for the TRS-80.<ref name=\"ciarcia198102\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1981-03/1981_03_BYTE_06-03_Programming_Methods#page/n37/mode/2up | title=Build the Disk-80 / Memory Expansion and Floppy-Disk Control | work=BYTE | date=February 1982 | accessdate=October 18, 2013 | author=Ciarcia, Steve | pages=36}}</ref>\n\nA data separator and a double density disk controller (based on the WD 1791 chip) were made by [[Percom]] (a Texas peripheral vendor), LNW, Tandy and others. The Percom Doubler adds the ability to boot and use [[Double Density]] floppies using a Percom-modified TRSDOS called DoubleDOS. The LNDoubler adds the ability to read and write from 5\u00bc\" diskette drives for a total of 1.2 [[Megabyte|MB]] storage. Near the end of the Model I's lifespan in 1982, upgrades were offered to replace its original controller with a double density one.\n\nThe first disk drives offered on the Model I were Shugart SA-400s which supported 35 tracks and was the sole 5.25\" drive on the market in 1977-78. By 1979, other manufacturers began offering drives. Models 3/4/4P uses Tandon TM-100 40-track drives. The combination of 40 tracks and double-density gives a capacity of 180 kilobytes per single-sided floppy disk. The use of index-sync means that a \"[[flippy disk]]\" requires a second index hole and write-enable notch. One could purchase factory-made \"flippies\". Some software publishers formatted one side for Apple systems and the other for the TRS-80.\n\nThe usual method of connecting floppy drives involves setting the drive letter via jumper blocks on the drive controller board, but Tandy opted for a slightly more user-friendly technique where all four select pins on the drives are jumpered and the ribbon cable is missing the Drive Select line. Thus, the user does not need to worry about moving jumpers around depending on which position on the chain a drive was in.\n\nA standard flat floppy ribbon cable is usable on the Model I, in which case the drives is jumpered to their number on the chain, or even an IBM PC \"twist\" cable, which requires setting each drive number to 1, but only permits two drives on the chain.\n\nAlthough third party DOSes allow the user to define virtually any floppy format wanted, the \"lowest common denominator\" format for TRS-80s is the baseline single density, single sided, 35-40 track format of the Model I.\n\nThird-party vendors like Aerocomp made available double-sided and 80 track 5-1/4 inch and later 3-1/2 inch floppy drives with up to 720 KB of storage each. These new drives are half-height and therefore require different or modified drive housings.\n\n=== Exatron Stringy Floppy ===\nAn alternative to cassette tape and floppy disk storage was provided by [[Exatron]]. The device is a continuous loop tape drive, dubbed the [[Exatron Stringy Floppy|\"stringy floppy\"]] or ESF. It requires no Expansion Interface, plugging directly into the TRS-80's 40-pin expansion bus, is much less expensive than a floppy drive, can read and write random-access data like a floppy drive unlike a cassette tape, and it transfers data at up to 14,400 [[baud]]. Exatron tape cartridges store over 64 KB of data. The ESF can coexist with the TRS-80 data cassette drive. It was popular with TRS-80 enthusiasts, selling over 4,000 units by 1981. Exatron also made a complementary RAM expansion board that installed in the TRS-80 keyboard to increase memory to 48 KB without the EI.<ref name=\"lundell19810831X\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rD0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA47&lpg=PA47&dq=%22stringy+floppy+from+exatron%22&source=bl&ots=aQTZ-jAvMe&sig=ZuddZf8Qe3JgewbO4LPR0hWuu_c&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi4wf-ojdLTAhWB4iYKHYkyAb8Q6AEIOjAE#v=onepage&q=%22stringy%20floppy%20from%20exatron%22&f=false | title=Stringy Floppy from Exatron | work=InfoWorld | date=August 31, 1981 | accessdate=February 15, 2015 | author=Lundell, Allan | pages=47\u201348}}</ref>\n\n=== Hard drive ===\nRadioShack introduced a 5 MB external hard disk for the TRS-80 Model III/4 in 1983. It is the same hard disk unit offered for the Model II line, but came with OS software for Model III/4. An adapter is required to connect it to the Model I's E/I.<ref>{{cite web|title=Radio Shack Computer Catalog RSC-8, page 52|url=http://www.radioshackcatalogs.com/html/catalogs_extra/1983_rsc-08/h052.html|website=Radio Shack Catalogs dot com|publisher=Tandy/RadioShack|accessdate=May 2, 2017}}</ref> The unit is about the same size as a modern desktop computer enclosure. Up to four hard disks can be daisychained for 20 MB of storage. The [[LDOS (operating system)|LDOS]] operating system by [[Logical Systems]] was bundled, which provides utilities for managing the storage space and flexible backup. The initial retail price for the first (primary) unit (US$2495) is equivalent to US${{Inflation|US|2495|1983|r=-2}} in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}. Later, a 15MB hard disk was offered in a white case, which can be daisychained for up to 60 MB. Like most hard disks used on 8-bit machines, there is no provision for subdirectories, but the DiskDISK utility is a useful alternative that creates virtual hard disk \".DSK\" files that can be mounted as another disk drive, and used like a subdirectory would.  To display the directory/contents of an unmounted DiskDISK virtual disk file, a shareware DDIR \"Virtual Disk Directory Utility\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=McKay |first1=Bryan |title=DDIR read-me |date=Jan 2, 1986 |page=1}}</ref> program was commonly used.\n\n=== Printers ===\nThe \"Quick Printer\",<ref>{{cite web|title=Radio Shack Computer Catalog RSC-2, page 16|url=http://www.radioshackcatalogs.com/html/catalogs_extra/1978_rsc-02/h016.html|website=Radio Shack Catalogs dot com|publisher=Tandy/RadioShack|accessdate=May 2, 2017}}</ref> is an electrostatic rotary printer that scans the video memory through the bus connector, and prints an image of the screen onto aluminum-coated paper in about one second. Unfortunately, it is incompatible with both the final, buffered version of the expansion interface, and with the \"heartbeat\" interrupt used for the real-time clock under Disk BASIC. This can be overcome by using special cabling, and by doing a \"dummy\" write to the cassette port while triggering the printer.\n\nTwo 3rd party printers were for 57&nbsp;mm metal coated paper, selling for approximately DM 600 in Germany, and a [[dot-matrix printer]] built by [[Centronics]] for normal paper, costing at first DM 3000, later sold at approximately DM 1500 in some stores. It has only 7 pins, so letters with descenders such as lowercase \"g\" do not reach under the baseline, but are elevated within the normal line.\n\nRadioShack offered an extensive line of printers for the TRS-80 family, ranging from basic 9-pin dot matrix units to large wide-carriage line printers for professional use, daisy-wheel printers, ink jet printers, laser printers and color plotters. All have a Centronics-standard interface and after the introduction of the [[TRS-80 Color Computer|Color Computer]] in 1980, many also had a connector for the CoCo's serial interface.\n\nFP-215 is a flatbed [[plotter]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/human39/fp-215-plotter|title=GitHub - human39/fp-215-plotter: Radio Shack TRS-80 FP-215 Flatbed Plotter Info|date=August 11, 2019|via=GitHub}}</ref>\n\n== Software ==\n=== BASIC ===\nThree versions of the [[BASIC]] programming language were produced for the Model I. ''[[Level I BASIC]]'' fits in 4 KB of [[read-only memory|ROM]], and ''Level II BASIC'' fits into 12 KB of ROM. Level I is single precision only and had a smaller set of commands. Level II introduced double precision floating point support and has a much wider set of commands. Level II was further enhanced when a disk system was added, allowing for the loading of ''Disk BASIC''.{{r|thomas1977}}\n\nLevel I BASIC is based on [[Li-Chen Wang]]'s free [[Tiny BASIC]] with some additional functions added by RadioShack.{{r|leininger19770917}} It has an excellent manual{{r|thomas1977}}{{r|yeager197908}}{{r|archer198310}}\u2014the ''User's Manual for Level 1'' by [[David A. Lien]]\u2014which presents lessons on programming with text and humorous cartoons, making the subjects very easy to understand. Lien wrote that it was \"written specifically for people who don't know anything about computers ... I want you to have fun with your computer! I don't want you to be afraid of it, because there is nothing to fear\".<ref name=\"lien1977\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/Level_1_Users_Manual_1977_David_Lien#page/n0/mode/2up |title=User's Manual for Level 1 |last=Lien |first=David A. |date=1978 |page=1}}</ref>{{r|fylstra197804}} Level I BASIC has only two [[string (computer science)|string]] variables (<code>A$</code> and <code>B$</code>), 26 numeric variables (<code>A</code> \u2013 <code>Z</code>), and one array, <code>A()</code>. Code for functions like SIN(), COS() and TAN() is not included in ROM but printed at the end of the book. The only error messages are \"<code>WHAT?</code>\" for syntax errors, \"<code>HOW?</code>\" for arithmetic errors such as [[division by zero]], and \"<code>SORRY</code>\" for [[out of memory]] errors.\n\nLevel I BASIC is not [[tokenized]]; reserved words are stored literally. In order to maximize the code that fits into 4K of memory, users can enter abbreviations for reserved words. For example, writing \"<code>P.</code>\" instead of \"<code>PRINT</code>\" saves 3 bytes.\n\nLevel II BASIC, introduced in mid-1978, was licensed from [[Microsoft]] and is required to use the expansion bus and disk drives. RadioShack always intended for Level I BASIC to be a stopgap until Level II was ready, and the first brochure for the Model I in January 1978 mentioned that Level II BASIC was \"coming soon\". It is an abridged version of the 16k [[Microsoft BASIC|Extended BASIC]], since the Model I has 12k of ROM space. According to [[Bill Gates]], \"It was a sort of intermediate between 8k BASIC and Extended BASIC. Some features from Extended BASIC such as descriptive errors and user defined functions were not included, but there were double precision variables and the PRINT USING statement that we wanted to get in. The entire development of Level II BASIC took about four weeks from start to finish.\" The accompanying manual is more terse and technical than the Level I manual. Original Level I BASIC-equipped machines could be retrofitted to Level II through a ROM replacement performed by RadioShack for a fee (originally $199). Users with Level I BASIC programs stored on cassette have to convert these to the tokenized Level II BASIC before use.

Numerous alternative DOSes appeared, the most prominent being [[Logical Disk Operating System|LDOS]] because Radio Shack licensed it from Logical Systems and adopted it as its official DOS for its Models I and III hard disk drive products. Other alternative TRS-80 DOSes included [[NewDos/80|NewDOS]] from Apparat Personal Computers, and [[DoubleDOS]], [[DOSPlus]], [[MicroDOS]], [[UltraDOS]] (later called Multidos). The DOS for the Model 4 line was originally called TRSDOS Version 6 but was actually produced by and licensed from Logical Systems, and is technically a descendant of the original Model I LDOS.\n\nThe memory map of the Model I and III render them incompatible with the standard [[CP/M]] OS for Z80 business computers, which loads at [[hexadecimal]] address $0000 with TPA ([[Transient Program Area]]) starting at $0100; the TRS-80 ROM resides in this address space.

Shortly after the Model III's introduction, Model I production was discontinued as it did not comply with new [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] regulations as of January 1, 1981 regarding [[electromagnetic interference]].{{r|hogan19810831}}{{r|hoganm319810831}}<ref name=\"robertson198012\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/80-microcomputing-magazine-1980-12/80Microcomputing_1280#page/n49/mode/2up | title=Model I Caught By FCC Fallout | accessdate=March 21, 2011 | author=Robertson, Nancy | date=December 1980 | work=[[80 Micro]]computing | pages=51, 56}}</ref>{{r|newsletter_8101}}{{r|white198708}}\n\nTandy distinguished between the high-end Model II{{r|freibergerfuture19810831}} and Model III, describing the latter as \"an administrative system, good for things like word processing, data management and VisiCalc operations\" and suitable for small businesses.{{r|freiberger19810831}} The lowest-priced version of the Model III was sold with 4KB of RAM and cassette storage. The computer's CPU board has three banks of sockets (8 sockets to a bank) which take type 4116 DRAMs, so memory configurations come in 16KB, 32KB, or 48KB RAM memory sizes. Computers with 32K or 48K RAM can be upgraded with floppy disk drive storage. There is space inside the computer cabinet for two full-height drives. Those offered by Tandy/RadioShack are single-sided, 40 track, double-density (MFM encoding) for 180K of storage. Third-party suppliers offered double-sided and 80-track drives, though to control them they had to modify the TRSDOS driver code or else furnish an alternative third-party DOS which could (see below). The installation of floppy disk drives also requires the computer's power supply to be upgraded. There is no internal cooling fan in the Model III; it uses passive convection cooling (unless an unusual number of power-hungry expansions were installed internally, such as a hard disk drive, graphics board, speedup kit, RS-232 board, etc.).\n\nTandy claimed that the Model III was compatible with 80% of Model I software.{{r|freiberger19810831}} Many software publishers issued patches to permit their Model I programs to run on the Model III. Marketing director Ed Juge explained that their designers considered changing from the Model I's 64 column by 16 row video screen layout, but that they ultimately decided that maintaining compatibility was most important.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Juge |first1=Ed |title=80 Micro, January 1980, pages 10-11, \"Inside 80\" |url=https://archive.org/details/80-microcomputing-magazine-1980-09/page/n9 |website=archive dot org |publisher=CW Communications |accessdate=May 22, 2019|date=September 1980 }}</ref>\n\nThe Model III's memory map and system architecture is mostly the same as the Model I, but the disk drives and printer port were moved from memory mapped to port I/O, thus Model I software that attempts to manipulate the disk controller directly or output to the printer (in particular Model I DOSes and application packages such as Visicalc and Scripsit) will not work. Under the supplied TRSDOS 1.3 operating system Model I disks can be read in the Model III, but not vice versa.{{r|hogan19810831}} The optional LDOS OS (by Logical Systems Inc.) use a common disk format for both Model I and Model III versions.\n\nCustomers and developers complained of bugs in the Model III's Microsoft BASIC interpreter and TRSDOS.<ref name=\"freiberger19810831\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rD0EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA44&pg=PA49#v=onepage&f=false | title=Bugs in Radio Shack TRS-80 Model III: How Bad Are They? | accessdate=February 28, 2011 | author=Freiberger, Paul | date=August 31, 1981 | work=InfoWorld | page=49}}</ref> Tandy/RadioShack (and TRS-80 magazines like ''[[80 Micro]]'') periodically published many software patches to correct these deficiencies and to permit users to customize the software to their preferences.\n\nDifferences in the WD1771 and WD1791 floppy controllers created problems reading Model I disks on a Model III (the double density upgrade in the Model I include both chips while a Model III had only the WD1791). The WD1771 supports four data markers while the WD1791 only supports two, and some versions of TRSDOS for the Model I also use them. In addition, they are used by copy protection schemes. Software was available to allow Model I disks to be read on a Model III. The WD1791 supports the 500 bit/s bitrate needed for high density floppy drives, but the controller is not capable of using them without extensive modifications.\n\nTRSDOS for the Model III was developed in-house by Radio Shack rather than being contracted out like the Model I's DOS. None of the code base from Model I DOS was reused and the Model III DOS was rewritten from scratch; this also created some compatibility issues since the Model III DOS's API was not entirely identical to the Model I DOS. This was primarily to avoid legal disputes with Randy Cook over ownership of the code as had occurred with Model I DOS and also because Radio Shack originally planned several features for the Model III such as 80 column text support that were not included. Two early versions, 1.1 and 1.2, were replaced by version 1.3 in 1981 which became the standard Model III OS. TRSDOS 1.3 is not format compatible with 1.1 and 1.2; a utility called XFERSYS is provided which converted older format disks to TRSDOS 1.3 format (this change is permanent and the resultant disks cannot be read with the older DOS versions).\n\nThe Model III's boot screen was cleaned up from the Model I. Instead of displaying garbage on screen at power up, it displays a \"Diskette?\" prompt if a bootable floppy is not detected. The user can insert a disk and press any key to boot. On powerup or reset holding down the {{key press|Break}} key will boot the computer into ROM-based Level II BASIC. This capability is useful if the disk drive is not functioning and cannot boot a TRSDOS disk (or if a boot disk is not available); it permits an operator familiar with the machine hardware to perform diagnostics using BASIC's PEEK and POKE commands. This works for the Model 4 as well, but not for the 4P.\n\nWhile Model I DOS is fairly flexible in its capabilities, Model III DOS is hard coded to only support 180K single sided floppies, a problem fixed by the many third party DOSes. To that end, when Radio Shack introduced hard disks for the TRS-80 line in 1982, the company licensed LDOS rather than attempt to modify Model III DOS for hard disk support.\n\nLevel II BASIC on the Model III is 16K in size and incorporates a few features from Level I Disk BASIC\n\nTRSDOS 1.3 was given a few more minor updates, the last being in 1984, although the version number was unchanged. This includes at least one update that writes an Easter Egg message \"Joe, you rummy buzzard\" on an unused disk sector, which is reputedly a joke message left by a programmer in a beta version, but accidentally included in the production master.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.trs-80.org/trsdos-rummy-buzzard-release/|title=The TRSDOS \"rummy buzzard\" release|website=www.trs-80.org}}</ref>\n\nThe Model III keyboard lacks {{key press|CONTROL}}. Many application programs use {{key press|@}}, while others use {{key press|SHIFT|Up}}. Often {{key press|CLEAR}} is used in combination with number and alpha keys. The Model III keyboard also lacks {{key press|CAPS LOCK}}; to caps-lock the alpha keys the user presses {{key press|SHIFT|0}}. Under LDOS [[typeahead]] is supported.\n\nBecause TRSDOS 1.3 was found wanting by many users, Tandy offered (at additional cost) Logical System's LDOS Version 5 as an alternative. As with the Model I, other third-party sources also offered TRSDOS alternatives for the Model III, including NewDOS, Alphabit's MultiDOS, and Micro Systems Software's DOSPlus. These are compatible with TRSDOS 1.3 and ran the same applications programs, but offer improved command structures, more and better system utilities, and enhancements to the Microsoft BASIC interpreter. After writing the original Model I TRSDOS, Randy Cook began work on his own DOS, titled VTOS, which was superseded by LDOS and also created some frustration for users as it is the only TRS-80 DOS to be copy protected.\n\nAlthough mostly intended as a disk-based computer, the Model III was available in a base cassette configuration with no disk hardware and only 16K of RAM with Level II BASIC. Radio Shack also offered a 4K version with Level I BASIC, identical to Model I Level I BASIC, but with the addition of LPRINT and LLIST commands for printer output. Upgrading to a disk machine necessitate installing at least 32K of RAM, the disk controller board, and an additional power supply for the disk drives. Disk upgrades purchased from Radio Shack included TRSDOS 1.3; users upgrading from third-party vendors had to purchase DOS separately (most opted for LDOS or DOSPlus), though a great many Model III applications programs included a licensed copy of TRSDOS 1.3.\n\nAs with the Model I's E/I, the RS-232C port on the Model III was an extra cost option and not included in the base price of the computer, though the dual disk Model III for $2495 included the serial port.\n\nLike the Model I, the Model III sold well in the educational market. Many school administrators valued the Model III's all-in-one hardware design because it made it more difficult for students to steal components.{{r|white198708}} ''InfoWorld'' approved of the Model III's single-unit design, simplified cable management, and improvements such as lack of keyboard bounce and improved disk reliability. The reviewer, a former Model I owner, stated \"I'm impressed\" and that \"had the Model III been available, it's probable that I wouldn't have sold it\". He concluded, \"If you're looking for a computer that's not too expensive but that performs well, you would be wise to test the Model III\u2014you might end up buying it.\"{{r|hoganm319810831}}\n\nDon French, who had left Radio Shack to found FMG Software after designing the Model I, expressed his disappointment in the new machine while trying to convert CP/M to run on it. \"I've encountered numerous problems with the floppy drive and its interface. Radio Shack will sell a Model III to anyone. They're trying to market it as a business computer when the existing software is woefully inadequate. 48K just isn't enough. You run out of memory before you get going. They're selling a medical package that takes up nine disks. I think the Model III is a very poorly conceived machine\".{{r|freiberger19810831}}\n\n==== Aftermarket products ====\nAftermarket hardware were offered by Tandy/RadioShack and many third-party manufacturers. The usual selection of add-ons and peripherals available for the Model I were offered: outboard floppy drives (one or two could be plugged into a card-edge connector on the back panel), an outboard hard disk drive (LDOS was furnished as Tandy's hard drive OS vice TRSDOS), a high-resolution graphics board<ref>{{cite web|title=1983 Radio Shack Computer Catalog RSC-8, page 52|url=http://www.radioshackcatalogs.com/html/catalogs_extra/1983_rsc-08/hr052.html|website=radioshackcatalogs dot com|publisher=Tandy/RadioShack|accessdate=April 26, 2017}}</ref> (resolution 512 by 192 pixels),<ref group=\"note\">The Radio Shack catalog entry advertises 640x240 resolution, but this is a misprint</ref> an RS-232C serial port on an internal circuit card, and a parallel printer (connected by a card-edge connector).

It can be programmed to play up to five voices with a range of six octaves stereophonically. A great many Orch-90 (as it was often called) music files were available for download from [[CompuServe]]. The Orch-90 was licensed from a company called Software Affair, which also produced the Model I-compatible Orchestra-85 from 1981.\n\nA number of third-party manufacturers specialized in upgrading Model IIIs with high performance hardware and software, and remarketing them under their own labels.<ref>{{cite web |title=80 Micro magazine, April 1983, pages 81-94, \"The Muscle Micros, These Three Sleek Supercharged Model IIIs...\" |url=https://archive.org/details/80-microcomputing-magazine-1983-04/page/n81 |website=archive dot org |publisher=80 Micro |accessdate=May 22, 2019|date=April 1983 }}</ref><ref group=\"note\">It was necessary to rebrand these highly modified Model IIIs because Radio Shack enforced a strict policy that no repair service would be performed on nonstandard RS products.</ref> The improvements typically included internal hard disk drives, greater capacity floppy drives, 4 MHz Z80 speedup kits, professional grade green or amber CRT video displays, better DOS software (typically DOSPlus by Micro Systems Software or LDOS by Logical Systems) including the all-important hard drive backup utilities, and custom menu-driven shell interfaces which insulated non-expert users (business employees) from the DOS command line. These were touted as high productivity turnkey systems for small businesses at less cost than competing business systems from higher-end providers such as IBM and DEC, as well as Radio Shack's own [[TRS-80 Model II]].\n\n==== Models III/4 compatibility ====\nRadioShack suffered much criticism for incomplete compatibility between the Models I and III, so made a special effort to ensure that the Model III's successor would run all of its software. The Model 4 included all of the Model III's hardware, port assignments and operating modes, and thus is virtually one hundred percent compatible down to the machine level.\n\nModel III programs running on a Model 4 can access the Model 4's additional hardware features (like 4 MHz clock rate, bigger video screen and keyboard, banked RAM above 64 KB) by manipulating its machine ports. There were aftermarket software packages that made this capability available to non-programmer users.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Soltoff |first1=Roy |title=The Misosys Quarterly Vol. I.iii pg. 6, \"LDOS 5.3 Model 4 Hardware Interface Kit\" |url=https://www.tim-mann.org/trs80/doc/TMQ%20Vol%20I.iii.pdf |website=tim-mann dot org |publisher=Misosys, Inc. |accessdate=November 12, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Dalton |first1=David |title=80 Micro magazine, Sept. 1985, pg. 33, product review \"The Enhancer\" |url=https://archive.org/details/80-microcomputing-magazine-1985-09/page/n33 |website=archive dot org |publisher=CW Communications |accessdate=November 12, 2019|date=September 1985 }}</ref>\n\n=== Model 4{{anchor|model4}} ===\n{{main|TRS-80 Model 4}}\n[[File:TRS-80 Model 4 (modified).jpg|thumb|TRS-80 Model 4 (standard version)]]\n[[File:TRS-80 Model 4P Crop Delsener.jpg|thumb|TRS-80 Model 4P]]\nThe successor to the Model III is the [[TRS-80 Model 4]] (April 1983).

It is functionally the same as the dual-drive desktop model but lacks the card edge connector for two outboard diskette drives and for cassette tape interface. It has a slot for an internal modem card and could emulate a Model III.\n\nThe Model 4D with bundled Deskmate productivity suite was introduced in early 1985. It has a revised CPU board using faster gate array logic which includes the floppy controller and RS-232C circuitry, all on a single board. The computer has two internal double-sided diskette drives, and is the last model descended from the 1977 Model I. It retailed for $1199 at its introduction in 1985.
