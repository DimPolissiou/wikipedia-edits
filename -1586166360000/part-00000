This Difficulty Bomb was added to the network on block 200,000 in an upgrade named Ice Age. While Ethereum Classic participants debated the merit of the Difficulty Bomb, a network upgrade called Die Hard at block 3,000,000 delayed the effects of the mechanism. Once the network participants came to consensus on the issue, Ethereum Classic upgraded its network on block 5,900,000 to permanently defuse the Difficulty Bomb. This abandoned a future with Proof-of-Stake and committed the network to the Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism.\n\n==Characteristics==\n{{See|Cryptocurrency}}\n{{Infobox cryptocurrency\n| currency_name = Ether (ETC)\n| image_1 = Ethereum Classic ETC Logo.png\n| image_2 = \n| image_background_1 = \n| image_background_2 = \n| image_width_1 = \n| alt1 = \n| image_width_2 = \n| alt2 = \n| image_title_1 = ETC Logo\n| image_title_2 = ETC Matte Logo\n| superunit_name_1 = \n| subunit_name_1 = \n| superunit_ratio_1 = \n| subunit_ratio_3 = 10<sup>\u22129</sup>\n| subunit_name_3 = Gwei\n| subunit_ratio_5 = 10<sup>\u221218</sup>\n| subunit_name_5 = Wei\n| plural = Ether(s)\n| symbol = \u039e\n| alt_symbol_title_1 =\n| alt_symbol_1 =\n| ticker_symbol = ETC\n| previous_names = Ethereum, ETH, Eth\n| nickname = Ether Classic, Eth Classic, Classic\n| precision = 18\n| white_paper = [https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper ethereum whitepaper]\n| implementations = [http://ethereumvm.net EVM 61]\n| initial_release_version = Frontier\n| initial_release_date = {{Start date and age|df=yes|2015|07|30}}\n| code_repository = {{URL|github.com/ethereumclassic}}\n| status = Active\n| latest_release_version = Agharta\n| latest_release_date = {{Start date and age|2020|01|11|df=yes}}\n| project_fork_of = \n| programming_languages = [[C++]], [[Go (programming language)|Go]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]], [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]]\n| operating_system = [[Cross-platform software|Cross-platform]]\n| author = [[Vitalik Buterin]], [[Gavin Wood]]\n| developer = [[Open-source software development|Open-Source Software Development]]\n| source_model = [[Open-source model|Open-Source Model]]\n| license = [[open-source license|Open-Source Licenses]]\n| website = {{URL|ethereumclassic.org}}\n| block_explorer = [https://blockscout.com/etc/mainnet/ BlockScout], [https://expedition.dev Expedition]\n| ledger_start = {{Start date and age|2015|07|30|df=yes}}\n| split_height = 1,920,000\n| split_date = {{Start date and age|2016|07|20|df=yes}}\n| split_from = Ethereum (ETH)\n| split_ratio = 1:1\n| hash_function = [[SHA3|Keccack]]\n| issuance_schedule = Block reward reduction of 20% every 5,000,000 blocks.\n| timestamping = [[Proof-of-work system|Proof-of-Work]] - [[Ethash]]\n| merged_mining_parent = Ethereum (ETH)\n| block_time = 13 secs\n| block_reward = 3.2 ETC\n| circulating_supply = [https://etc.tokenview.com/ 116,811,000]\n| supply_limit = [https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1017 210,700,000]\n| exchange_rate = $12 (Feb. 2020)\n| market_cap = $1.4 billion (Feb. 2020)\n| footnotes = {{notelist|group=infobox}}\n}}\n\nAs with other cryptocurrencies, the validity of each ether is provided by a [[blockchain]], which is a continuously growing list of [[Record (computer science)|records]], called ''blocks'', which are linked and secured using [[cryptography]].<ref name=\"te20151031\">{{cite journal|date=31 October 2015|title=Blockchains: The great chain of being sure about things|url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21677228-technology-behind-bitcoin-lets-people-who-do-not-know-or-trust-each-other-build-dependable|journal=[[The Economist]]|access-date=18 June 2016|quote=The technology behind bitcoin lets people who do not know or trust each other build a dependable ledger.

This does not rely upon [[unspent transaction outputs]] (UTXOs). The state denotes the current balances of all accounts and extra data. The state is not stored on the blockchain, it is stored in a separate [[Merkle tree|Merkle]] Patricia tree. A [[cryptocurrency wallet]] stores the [[Public-key cryptography|public and private \"keys\"]] or \"addresses\" which can be used to receive or spend ether. These can be generated through BIP 39 style mnemonics for a BIP 32 \"HD Wallet\". In the Ethereum tech stack, this is unnecessary as it does not operate in a UTXO scheme. With the private key, it is possible to write in the blockchain, effectively making an ether transaction.\n\nTo send ether to an account, you need the [[SHA-3|Keccak-256]] hash of the public key of that account. Ether accounts are pseudonymous in that they are not linked to individual persons, but rather to one or more specific addresses.\n\n===Ether===\n''Ether'' is a fundamental token for operation of Ethereum Classic, which thereby provides a public [[distributed ledger]] for transactions. It is used to pay for gas, a unit of computation used in transactions and other state transitions. Additionally, this currency is commonly referred to as ''Ethereum'', ''Eth'', ''Classic'' or ''ETC''.\n\nIt is listed under the [[ticker symbol]] ETC and traded on [[cryptocurrency]] exchanges, and the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] [[Xi (letter)|uppercase Xi]] character (\u039e) is generally used for its [[currency symbol]]. It is also used to pay for transaction fees and computational services on the Ethereum Classic network.<ref name=NYTEVCRB>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/28/business/dealbook/ethereum-a-virtual-currency-enables-transactions-that-rival-bitcoins.html |title=Ethereum, a Virtual Currency, Enables Transactions That Rival Bitcoin's |last=Popper |first=Nathaniel |date=27 March 2016 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=2 September 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160724214904/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/28/business/dealbook/ethereum-a-virtual-currency-enables-transactions-that-rival-bitcoins.html |archivedate=24 July 2016 }}</ref>\n\n===Addresses===\nEthereum Classic addresses are composed of the prefix \"0x\", a common identifier for [[hexadecimal]], concatenated with the rightmost 20 bytes of the [[SHA-3|Keccak-256]] hash ([[Endianness|big endian]]) of the [[Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm|ECDSA]] [[Public-key cryptography|public key]] (the curve used is the so-called ''secp256k1'', the same as [[Bitcoin]]). In hexadecimal, 2 digits represent a byte, meaning addresses contain 40 hexadecimal digits. An example of an Ethereum Classic address is 0xb794f5ea0ba39494ce839613fffba74279579268.

While Ethereum Classic participants debated the merit of the Difficulty Bomb, a network upgrade called Die Hard at block 3,000,000 delayed the effects of the mechanism. Once the network participants came to consensus on the issue, Ethereum Classic upgraded its network on block 5,900,000 to permanently defuse the Difficulty Bomb. This abandoned a future with Proof-of-Stake and committed the network to the Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism.\n\n==Characteristics==\n{{See|Cryptocurrency}}\n{{Infobox cryptocurrency\n| currency_name = Ether (ETC)\n| image_1 = Ethereum Classic ETC Logo.png\n| image_2 = \n| image_background_1 = \n| image_background_2 = \n| image_width_1 = \n| alt1 = \n| image_width_2 = \n| alt2 = \n| image_title_1 = ETC Logo\n| image_title_2 = ETC Matte Logo\n| superunit_name_1 = \n| subunit_name_1 = \n| superunit_ratio_1 = \n| subunit_ratio_3 = 10<sup>\u22129</sup>\n| subunit_name_3 = Gwei\n| subunit_ratio_5 = 10<sup>\u221218</sup>\n| subunit_name_5 = Wei\n| plural = Ether(s)\n| symbol = \u039e\n| alt_symbol_title_1 =\n| alt_symbol_1 =\n| ticker_symbol = ETC\n| previous_names = Ethereum, ETH, Eth\n| nickname = Ether Classic, Eth Classic, Classic\n| precision = 18\n| white_paper = [https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper ethereum whitepaper]\n| implementations = [http://ethereumvm.net EVM 61]\n| initial_release_version = Frontier\n| initial_release_date = {{Start date and age|df=yes|2015|07|30}}\n| code_repository = {{URL|github.com/ethereumclassic}}\n| status = Active\n| latest_release_version = Agharta\n| latest_release_date = {{Start date and age|2020|01|11|df=yes}}\n| project_fork_of = \n| programming_languages = [[C++]], [[Go (programming language)|Go]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]], [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]]\n| operating_system = [[Cross-platform software|Cross-platform]]\n| author = [[Vitalik Buterin]], [[Gavin Wood]]\n| developer = [[Open-source software development|Open-Source Software Development]]\n| source_model = [[Open-source model|Open-Source Model]]\n| license = [[open-source license|Open-Source Licenses]]\n| website = {{URL|ethereumclassic.org}}\n| block_explorer = [https://blockscout.com/etc/mainnet/ BlockScout], [https://expedition.dev Expedition]\n| ledger_start = {{Start date and age|2015|07|30|df=yes}}\n| split_height = 1,920,000\n| split_date = {{Start date and age|2016|07|20|df=yes}}\n| split_from = Ethereum (ETH)\n| split_ratio = 1:1\n| hash_function = [[SHA3|Keccack]]\n| issuance_schedule = Block reward reduction of 20% every 5,000,000 blocks.\n| timestamping = [[Proof-of-work system|Proof-of-Work]] - [[Ethash]]\n| merged_mining_parent = Ethereum (ETH)\n| block_time = 13 secs\n| block_reward = 3.2 ETC\n| circulating_supply = [https://etc.tokenview.com/ 116,811,000]\n| supply_limit = [https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1017 210,700,000]\n| exchange_rate = $12 (Feb. 2020)\n| market_cap = $1.4 billion (Feb. 2020)\n| footnotes = {{notelist|group=infobox}}\n}}\n\nAs with other cryptocurrencies, the validity of each ether is provided by a [[blockchain]], which is a continuously growing list of [[Record (computer science)|records]], called ''blocks'', which are linked and secured using [[cryptography]].<ref name=\"te20151031\">{{cite journal|date=31 October 2015|title=Blockchains: The great chain of being sure about things|url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21677228-technology-behind-bitcoin-lets-people-who-do-not-know-or-trust-each-other-build-dependable|journal=[[The Economist]]|access-date=18 June 2016|quote=The technology behind bitcoin lets people who do not know or trust each other build a dependable ledger.

This does not rely upon [[unspent transaction outputs]] (UTXOs). The state denotes the current balances of all accounts and extra data. The state is not stored on the blockchain, it is stored in a separate [[Merkle tree|Merkle]] Patricia tree. A [[cryptocurrency wallet]] stores the [[Public-key cryptography|public and private \"keys\"]] or \"addresses\" which can be used to receive or spend ether. These can be generated through BIP 39 style mnemonics for a BIP 32 \"HD Wallet\". In the Ethereum tech stack, this is unnecessary as it does not operate in a UTXO scheme. With the private key, it is possible to write in the blockchain, effectively making an ether transaction.\n\nTo send ether to an account, you need the [[SHA-3|Keccak-256]] hash of the public key of that account. Ether accounts are pseudonymous in that they are not linked to individual persons, but rather to one or more specific addresses.\n\n===Ether===\n''Ether'' is a fundamental token for operation of Ethereum Classic, which thereby provides a public [[distributed ledger]] for transactions. It is used to pay for gas, a unit of computation used in transactions and other state transitions. Additionally, this currency is commonly referred to as ''Ethereum'', ''Eth'', ''Classic'' or ''ETC''.\n\nIt is listed under the [[ticker symbol]] ETC and traded on [[cryptocurrency]] exchanges, and the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] [[Xi (letter)|uppercase Xi]] character (\u039e) is generally used for its [[currency symbol]]. It is also used to pay for transaction fees and computational services on the Ethereum Classic network.<ref name=NYTEVCRB>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/28/business/dealbook/ethereum-a-virtual-currency-enables-transactions-that-rival-bitcoins.html |title=Ethereum, a Virtual Currency, Enables Transactions That Rival Bitcoin's |last=Popper |first=Nathaniel |date=27 March 2016 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=2 September 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160724214904/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/28/business/dealbook/ethereum-a-virtual-currency-enables-transactions-that-rival-bitcoins.html |archivedate=24 July 2016 }}</ref>\n\n===Addresses===\nEthereum Classic addresses are composed of the prefix \"0x\", a common identifier for [[hexadecimal]], concatenated with the rightmost 20 bytes of the [[SHA-3|Keccak-256]] hash ([[Endianness|big endian]]) of the [[Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm|ECDSA]] [[Public-key cryptography|public key]] (the curve used is the so-called ''secp256k1'', the same as [[Bitcoin]]). In hexadecimal, 2 digits represent a byte, meaning addresses contain 40 hexadecimal digits. An example of an Ethereum Classic address is 0xb794f5ea0ba39494ce839613fffba74279579268.

Its rhythms can be traced back to West African [[Kaiso]] and the arrival of French planters and their slaves from the [[French Antilles]] in the 18th century.\n\nIt is characterized by highly rhythmic and harmonic vocals, and is most often sung in a [[French-based creole languages|French creole]] and led by a [[griot]]. As calypso developed, the role of the griot became known as a ''chantuelle'' and eventually, ''[[calypsonian]]''. As English replaced \"patois\" ([[Antillean creole]]) as the dominant language, calypso migrated into English, and in so doing it attracted more attention from the government. It allowed the masses to challenge the doings of the unelected Governor and Legislative Council, and the elected town councils of [[Port of Spain]] and [[San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago|San Fernando]]. Calypso continued to play an important role in political expression, and also served to document the history of Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nCalypso in the Caribbean includes a range of genres, including: the [[Benna (genre)|Benna]] in [[music of Antigua and Barbuda|Antigua and Barbuda]]; [[Mento]], a style of [[Music of Jamaica|Jamaican]] [[folk music]] that greatly influenced [[ska]] and [[reggae]]; [[Ska]], the precursor to [[rocksteady]], and reggae; [[Spouge]], a style of Barbadian popular music; [[Dominica]] [[Cadence-lypso]], which mixed calypso with the [[cadence rampa|cadence]] of [[Haiti]]; and [[soca music]], a style of [[Kaiso]]/calypso, with influences from chutney, [[Soul music|soul]], [[funk]], Latin and cadence-lypso.\n\n== Etymology ==\nIt is thought that the name \"calypso\" was originally \"kaiso\" which is now believed to come from [[Efik language|Efik]] \"ka isu\" (\"go on!\") and [[Ibibio language|Ibibio]] \"kaa iso\" (\"continue, go on\"), used in urging someone on or in backing a contestant.<ref name=\":0\">Richard Allsopp, ''Dictionary of Caribbean English Usage'' (Oxford University Press, 1996), p. 131.</ref> There is also a Trinidadian term \"cariso\" that means \"old-time\" calypsos.<ref>Mendes (1986), p. 30.</ref>  The term \"calypso\" is recorded from the 1930s onwards. Alternatively, the insert for ''The Rough Guide to Calypso and Soca'' (published by [[World Music Network]]) favours John Cowley's arguments in ''Carnival, Canboulay and Calypso: Traditions in the Making,'' that the word might be a corruption of the French ''carrouseaux'' and through the process of patois and Anglicization became ''caliso'' and then finally \"calypso\"; however, Cowley also notes that the first mention of the word \"calypso\" is given in a description of a dance in 1882 by [[Abb\u00e9 Masse]].<ref name=\":1\">John Cowley, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rHFOemkETacC&pg=PA98&lpg=PA98&dq=%22Abb%C3%A9+Masse%22+calypso&source=bl&ots=yCiZXj3znX&sig=1Sw7oZ37Mb4366LcDQiSrsJ4mrk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=QXJFUrq_Aq2b0wWe3YCABg&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Abb%C3%A9%20Masse%22%20calypso&f=false ''Carnival, Canboulay and Calypso: Traditions in the Making''], Cambridge University Press, p. 98.</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nCalypso music was developed in [[Trinidad]] in the 17th century from the West African [[Kaiso]] and [[canboulay music]] brought by African slaves imported to that Caribbean island to work on sugar plantations. The slaves, brought to toil on sugar plantations, were stripped of all connections to their homeland and family and not allowed to talk to each other. They used calypso to mock the slave masters and to communicate with each other. Many early calypsos were sung in [[French-based creole languages|French Creole]] by an individual called a [[griot]]. As calypso developed, the role of the griot became known as a ''chantuelle'' and eventually, ''[[calypsonian]]''.\n\nModern calypso, however, began in the 19th century, a fusion of disparate elements ranging from the [[Masquerade ceremony|masquerade]] song ''[[lavway]]'', French Creole ''[[B\u00e8l\u00e8 (dance)|belair]]'' and the [[calinda]] stick-fighting [[chantwell]]. Calypso's early rise was closely connected with the adoption of Carnival by [[Trinidadian]] slaves, including [[canboulay]] drumming and the music masquerade processions. The French brought [[Carnival]] to Trinidad, and calypso competitions at Carnival grew in popularity, especially after the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition of slavery]] in 1834.\n\n===Recordings===\nThe first identifiably calypso genre song was recorded in 1912, by [[Lovey's String Band]] while visiting [[New York City]]. In 1914, the second calypso recordings\u2014including the first sung in English\u2014were done by [[chantwell]] [[Julian Whiterose]], better known as the Iron Duke and famous calinda stick-fighter. Jules Sims would also record vocal calypsos. The majority of these calypsos of the [[World War I]] era were instrumentals by Lovey and [[Lionel Belasco]]. Perhaps due to the constraints of the wartime economy, no recordings of note were produced until the late 1920s and early 1930s, when the \"golden era\" of calypso would cement the style, form, and phrasing of the music.\n\nCalypso evolved into a way of spreading news around Trinidad. Politicians, [[journalists]] and public figures often debated the content of each song, and many islanders considered these songs the most reliable news source. [[Calypsonian]]s pushed the boundaries of free speech as their lyrics spread news of any topic relevant to island life, including speaking out against political corruption. Eventually British rule enforced [[censorship]] and police began to scan these songs for damaging content.\n\nEven with this censorship, calypsos continued to push boundaries, with a variety of ways to slip songs past the scrutinizing eyes of the editor. [[Double entendre]], or double-speak, was one way, as was the practice of denouncing countries such as Hitler's Germany and its annexation of [[Poland]], while making pointed references toward the [[UK]]'s policies on Trinidad. Sex, scandal, gossip, innuendo, politics, local news, bravado and insulting other calypsonians were the order of the day in classic calypso, just as it is today with classic [[Hip hop|hip-hop]]. And just as the hip-hop of today, the music sparked shock and outrage in moralistic sections of society.\n\nCountless recordings were dumped at sea in the name of censorship, although in truth, rival US companies did this in the spirit of underhanded competition, claiming that the rivals' material was unfit for US consumption. [[Decca Records]] lost untold pressings in this manner, as did its rival, [[RCA]]'s Bluebird label.\n\nAn entrepreneur named [[Eduardo Sa Gomes]] played a significant role in spreading calypso in its early days. Sa Gomes, a Portuguese immigrant who owned a local music and [[phonograph]] equipment shop in [[Port of Spain]], promoted the genre and gave financial support to the local artists. In March 1934, he sent [[Roaring Lion]] and [[Attila the Hun (calypsonian)|Attila the Hun]] to New York City to record; they became the first calypsonians to record abroad, bringing the genre out of the West Indies and into pop culture.<ref name=\":2\">Funk, Ray. [http://www.mustrad.org.uk/articles/kaiso25.htm \"Roaring Lion (Raphael Arius Kairiyama De Leon AKA Hubert Raphael Charles, 15.6.08 \u2013 11.7.99)\".]</ref> [[Lord Invader]] was quick to follow, and stayed in [[New York City]] after a protracted legal case involving the theft of his song \"[[Rum and Coca-Cola]]\", a hit by the [[Andrews Sisters]]. He made his home there along with [[Wilmoth Houdini]], and became one of the great calypsonians of the USA.\n\nEarly forms of calypso were also influenced by [[jazz]] such as Sans Humanitae. In this [[extempo]] ([[extemporaneous]]) melody calypsonians lyricise impromptu, commenting socially or insulting each other, \"sans humanit\u00e9\" or \"no mercy\" (which is again a reference to French influence).\n\n== Popularity==\nThe first major stars of calypso started crossing over to new audiences worldwide in the late 1930s. Attila the Hun, Roaring Lion and [[Lord Invader]] were first, followed by [[Lord Kitchener (calypsonian)|Lord Kitchener]], one of the longest-lasting calypso stars in history\u2014he continued to release hit records until his death in 2000.  1944's \"[[Rum and Coca-Cola]]\" by the [[Andrews Sisters]], a [[cover version]] of a Lord Invader song, became an American hit despite the song being a very critical commentary on the explosion of prostitution, inflation and other negative influences accompanying the American military bases in Trinidad at the time.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=tlBS-NQhLEYC&pg=PA163&lpg=PA163&dq=%22rum+and+coca+cola%22+trinidad+prostitution&source=web&ots=Qe482n7Qeh&sig=fVpVGt72r620chVZ7V51Xr_fHBA&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=8&ct=result ''Consuming the Caribbean''].</ref> Perhaps the most straightforward way to describe the focus of calypso is that it articulated itself as a form of protest against the authoritarian colonial culture which existed at the time.\n\nCalypso, especially a toned-down, commercial variant, became a worldwide craze with the release of the \"[[Banana Boat Song]]\", or \"Day-O\", a traditional [[Jamaica]]n folk song, whose best-known rendition was done by [[Harry Belafonte]] on his album ''[[Calypso (album)|Calypso]]'' (1956); ''Calypso'' was the first full-length calypso record to sell more than a million copies. The success of that album inspired hundreds of \"Folkies\", or the [[American folk music revival]] to imitate the \"Belafonte style\", but with a more folk-oriented flavor. The [[Kingston Trio]] would be a good example. 1956 also saw the massive international hit \"[[Jean and Dinah]]\" by [[Mighty Sparrow]]. This song too was a sly commentary as a \"plan of action\" for the calypsonian on the widespread prostitution and the prostitutes' desperation after the closing of the U.S. [[naval base]] on Trinidad at [[Chaguaramas, Trinidad|Chaguaramas]].\n\nIn the [[Broadway theater|Broadway-theatre]] [[Musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Jamaica (musical)|Jamaica]]'' (1957), [[Harold Arlen]] and [[Yip Harburg]] cleverly [[parody music|parodied]] \"commercial\" Belafonte-style calypso. Several films jumped on the calypso craze in 1957 such as ''[[Island in the Sun (film)|Island in the Sun]]'' ([[20th Century Fox]]) that featured Belafonte and the low-budget films ''[[Calypso Joe]]'' ([[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]), ''[[Calypso Heat Wave]]'' ([[Columbia Pictures]]), and ''[[Bop Girl Goes Calypso]]'' ([[United Artists]]).\n[[Robert Mitchum]] released an album, ''Calypso...Is Like So'' (1957), on [[Capitol records]], capturing the sound, spirit, and subtleties of the genre.\n[[Dizzy Gillespie]] recorded a calypso album ''Jambo Caribe'' (1964) with [[James Moody (saxophonist)|James Moody]] and [[Kenny Barron]].\n\nSoul shouter [[Gary U.S. Bonds|Gary \"US\" Bonds]] released a calypso album ''Twist up Calypso'' (1962) on Legrand records, shortly after returning home from his military post in Port of Spain. Nithi Kanagaratnam from Sri Lanka sang calypso-styled songs in Tamil in 1968, which was a success and earned him the title \"Father of Tamil Popular Music\". Since Baila rhythm was popular in Sri Lanka, most of his songs were classified as Tamil Baila.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, women entered the calypso men's-oriented arena. [2] Calypso Rose was the first woman to win the Trinidad Road March competition in 1977 with her song \"Gimme More Tempo\". The following year with \"Come Leh We Jam\", she won the \"Calypso King \" competition, the first time a woman had received the award. The competition's title was changed to Calypso Monarch in her honour.\nThe French and pioneer electronic musician [[Jean Michel Jarre]] released an album in 1990 called ''[[Waiting for Cousteau]]''. The album has four tracks: \"Calypso\", \"Calypso part 2\", \"Calypso part 3 Fin de Si\u00e8cle\" and \"Waiting for Cousteau\". It was dedicated to [[Jacques-Yves Cousteau]] in his 80th birthday. This album had a special participation of the Amocco Renegades (a traditional steel-drum band from [[Trinidad and Tobago]]). In the first track is possible to notice a strong style influence. Calypso had another short burst of commercial interest when [[Tim Burton]]'s horror/comedy film ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' (1988) was released, and used Belafonte's \"[[Jump In The Line (Shake, Senora)|Jump In The Line]]\" as the soundtrack's headliner and also \"The Banana Boat Song\" in the dinner-party scene. [[Disney]]'s song \"[[Under the Sea]]\", a calypso theme from ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] in 1989 as well as the [[Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media]] in 1991.\n\n== Sociopolitical influence ==\nCalypso music has been used by [[Calypsonian|Calypsonians]] to provide sociopolitical commentary. Prior to the independence of [[Trinidad and Tobago]], calypsonians would use their music to express the daily struggles of living in Trinidad, critique racial and economic inequalities, express opinions on social order, and voice overall concerns for those living on the island.<ref name=\"Blatter\">Blatter, Alfred (2007). ''Revisiting Music Theory: a guide to the practice'', p. 28. {{ISBN|0-415-97440-2}}.</ref> The Black lower class in particular used calypso music to protest inequalities inflicted upon them under British rule and advocate for their rights. In response, calypso music came to exist as a form of musical protest.\n\nDuring the independence movements of Trinidad and Tobago through the earlys 1950s up until 1962 when the nation gained independence, calypso lyrics critiqued British colonial rule. Lyrics were made to express feelings towards colonialism as being immoral and oppressive to Caribbean people. In particular, during the movement to independence, calypso music would include common messages of freedom, anti-colonialism and empowerment of African descended people.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Neville Marcano]], known as the [[Growling Tiger]], became notorious for creating songs calling for independence of Trinidad and Tobago. In his song titled \u201cAbraham Lincoln Speech at Gettysburg\u201d, Tiger used inspirations from [[Abraham Lincoln|Abraham Lincoln's]] famous [[Gettysburg Address|Gettysburg address]] to draw on values of liberty, equality and democracy.<ref name=\":0\" /> These three principles paralleled some of many ideas circulating during the nationalist movement in [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. His lyrics struck with those in support of an independent Trinidadian nation hoping to instill similar principles in their own free nation. \n\n[[Lord Kitchener (calypsonian)|Lord Kitchene]]<nowiki/>r, a largely known Calypsonian, became noted for his politically critical lyrics in his music. Kitchener used calypso to shed light on the grievances of the [[windrush generation]], a generation of Caribbean families migrating from the islands to England in response to increased labor demands after [[World War II]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wardle|first=Huon|last2=Obermuller|first2=Laura|date=2018|title=The Windrush generation|journal=Anthropology Today|language=en|volume=34|issue=4|pages=3\u20134|doi=10.1111/1467-8322.12445|issn=1467-8322}}</ref> Kitchener\u2019s 1948 song \u201cWindrush\u201d was written in two versions. The first version gained more global popularity as the lyrics expressed gratitude and appreciation of British rule. However, second version found greater popularity amongst Caribbean people themselves as the lyrics conveyed a story of exile, oppression and inequality living in England.<ref name=\":0\" /> Although Kitchener\u2019s alternate version of \u201cWindrush\u201d did not gain as much commercial popularity, the duality of the two versions exemplify how calypso music was used as an outlet to challenge colonialism.\n\nAfter Trinidad and Tobago gained independence in 1962, calypso music continued to be used as an outlet for political commentary. With [[Eric Williams]] serving as the first Prime Minister of an independent Trinidad and Tobago, calypsonian [[Mighty Sparrow]] released his song \u201cWilliam the Conqueror\u201d where he praises Williams\u2019 victory and prides the island in its new found independence.<ref name=\":1\" /> Sparrow sings:<blockquote>I am no politician, but I could understand if it wasn\u2019t for Brother Willie and his ability, Trinidad wouldn\u2019t go neither come. We used to vote for food and rum but nowadays we eating all the Indians and them. And in the ending, we voting PNM. Praise little Eric, rejoice and be glad. We have a better future here in Trinidad.<ref name=\":1\" /></blockquote>Calypso music has also been used by politicians to promote political agendas through Calypso competitions. The origins of calypso competitions dates back to the early 19th century post [[emancipation]] where formerly enslaved communities would hold calypso wars showcasing their singing and dancing.<ref name=\":2\" /> Later in 1953 Calypso competitions held the same showcasing nature, but became politicized as the [[People's National Movement|People\u2019s National Movement]] (PNM) took over as the main organizer of competitions.<ref name=\"Blatter\" /> The PNM used the competitions to combat social and class divisions by attracting participants of varying social status to participate and attend the competitions. The idea was to claim a national cultural identity and promote national unity.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Cadence-lypso]]\n* [[Canboulay]]\n* [[Calypso Monarch]]\n* [[Extempo]]\n* [[Soukous]] \n* [[Marrabenta]]\n* [[List of calypso musicians]]\n* [[List of calypso-like genres]]\n* [[List of Caribbean music genres]]\n* [[Mento]], a Jamaican folk music related to Calypso\n* [[Soca music]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* Hill, Donald R.

The French brought [[Carnival]] to Trinidad, and calypso competitions at Carnival grew in popularity, especially after the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition of slavery]] in 1834.\n\n===Recordings===\nThe first identifiably calypso genre song was recorded in 1912, by [[Lovey's String Band]] while visiting [[New York City]]. In 1914, the second calypso recordings\u2014including the first sung in English\u2014were done by [[chantwell]] [[Julian Whiterose]], better known as the Iron Duke and famous calinda stick-fighter. Jules Sims would also record vocal calypsos. The majority of these calypsos of the [[World War I]] era were instrumentals by Lovey and [[Lionel Belasco]]. Perhaps due to the constraints of the wartime economy, no recordings of note were produced until the late 1920s and early 1930s, when the \"golden era\" of calypso would cement the style, form, and phrasing of the music.\n\nCalypso evolved into a way of spreading news around Trinidad. Politicians, [[journalists]] and public figures often debated the content of each song, and many islanders considered these songs the most reliable news source. [[Calypsonian]]s pushed the boundaries of free speech as their lyrics spread news of any topic relevant to island life, including speaking out against political corruption. Eventually British rule enforced [[censorship]] and police began to scan these songs for damaging content.\n\nEven with this censorship, calypsos continued to push boundaries, with a variety of ways to slip songs past the scrutinizing eyes of the editor. [[Double entendre]], or double-speak, was one way, as was the practice of denouncing countries such as Hitler's Germany and its annexation of [[Poland]], while making pointed references toward the [[UK]]'s policies on Trinidad. Sex, scandal, gossip, innuendo, politics, local news, bravado and insulting other calypsonians were the order of the day in classic calypso, just as it is today with classic [[Hip hop|hip-hop]]. And just as the hip-hop of today, the music sparked shock and outrage in moralistic sections of society.\n\nCountless recordings were dumped at sea in the name of censorship, although in truth, rival US companies did this in the spirit of underhanded competition, claiming that the rivals' material was unfit for US consumption. [[Decca Records]] lost untold pressings in this manner, as did its rival, [[RCA]]'s Bluebird label.\n\nAn entrepreneur named [[Eduardo Sa Gomes]] played a significant role in spreading calypso in its early days. Sa Gomes, a Portuguese immigrant who owned a local music and [[phonograph]] equipment shop in [[Port of Spain]], promoted the genre and gave financial support to the local artists. In March 1934, he sent [[Roaring Lion]] and [[Attila the Hun (calypsonian)|Attila the Hun]] to New York City to record; they became the first calypsonians to record abroad, bringing the genre out of the West Indies and into pop culture.<ref name=\":2\">Funk, Ray. [http://www.mustrad.org.uk/articles/kaiso25.htm \"Roaring Lion (Raphael Arius Kairiyama De Leon AKA Hubert Raphael Charles, 15.6.08 \u2013 11.7.99)\".]</ref> [[Lord Invader]] was quick to follow, and stayed in [[New York City]] after a protracted legal case involving the theft of his song \"[[Rum and Coca-Cola]]\", a hit by the [[Andrews Sisters]]. He made his home there along with [[Wilmoth Houdini]], and became one of the great calypsonians of the USA.\n\nEarly forms of calypso were also influenced by [[jazz]] such as Sans Humanitae. In this [[extempo]] ([[extemporaneous]]) melody calypsonians lyricise impromptu, commenting socially or insulting each other, \"sans humanit\u00e9\" or \"no mercy\" (which is again a reference to French influence).\n\n== Popularity==\nThe first major stars of calypso started crossing over to new audiences worldwide in the late 1930s. Attila the Hun, Roaring Lion and [[Lord Invader]] were first, followed by [[Lord Kitchener (calypsonian)|Lord Kitchener]], one of the longest-lasting calypso stars in history\u2014he continued to release hit records until his death in 2000.  1944's \"[[Rum and Coca-Cola]]\" by the [[Andrews Sisters]], a [[cover version]] of a Lord Invader song, became an American hit despite the song being a very critical commentary on the explosion of prostitution, inflation and other negative influences accompanying the American military bases in Trinidad at the time.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=tlBS-NQhLEYC&pg=PA163&lpg=PA163&dq=%22rum+and+coca+cola%22+trinidad+prostitution&source=web&ots=Qe482n7Qeh&sig=fVpVGt72r620chVZ7V51Xr_fHBA&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=8&ct=result ''Consuming the Caribbean''].</ref> Perhaps the most straightforward way to describe the focus of calypso is that it articulated itself as a form of protest against the authoritarian colonial culture which existed at the time.\n\nCalypso, especially a toned-down, commercial variant, became a worldwide craze with the release of the \"[[Banana Boat Song]]\", or \"Day-O\", a traditional [[Jamaica]]n folk song, whose best-known rendition was done by [[Harry Belafonte]] on his album ''[[Calypso (album)|Calypso]]'' (1956); ''Calypso'' was the first full-length calypso record to sell more than a million copies. The success of that album inspired hundreds of \"Folkies\", or the [[American folk music revival]] to imitate the \"Belafonte style\", but with a more folk-oriented flavor. The [[Kingston Trio]] would be a good example. 1956 also saw the massive international hit \"[[Jean and Dinah]]\" by [[Mighty Sparrow]]. This song too was a sly commentary as a \"plan of action\" for the calypsonian on the widespread prostitution and the prostitutes' desperation after the closing of the U.S. [[naval base]] on Trinidad at [[Chaguaramas, Trinidad|Chaguaramas]].\n\nIn the [[Broadway theater|Broadway-theatre]] [[Musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Jamaica (musical)|Jamaica]]'' (1957), [[Harold Arlen]] and [[Yip Harburg]] cleverly [[parody music|parodied]] \"commercial\" Belafonte-style calypso. Several films jumped on the calypso craze in 1957 such as ''[[Island in the Sun (film)|Island in the Sun]]'' ([[20th Century Fox]]) that featured Belafonte and the low-budget films ''[[Calypso Joe]]'' ([[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]), ''[[Calypso Heat Wave]]'' ([[Columbia Pictures]]), and ''[[Bop Girl Goes Calypso]]'' ([[United Artists]]).\n[[Robert Mitchum]] released an album, ''Calypso...Is Like So'' (1957), on [[Capitol records]], capturing the sound, spirit, and subtleties of the genre.\n[[Dizzy Gillespie]] recorded a calypso album ''Jambo Caribe'' (1964) with [[James Moody (saxophonist)|James Moody]] and [[Kenny Barron]].\n\nSoul shouter [[Gary U.S. Bonds|Gary \"US\" Bonds]] released a calypso album ''Twist up Calypso'' (1962) on Legrand records, shortly after returning home from his military post in Port of Spain. Nithi Kanagaratnam from Sri Lanka sang calypso-styled songs in Tamil in 1968, which was a success and earned him the title \"Father of Tamil Popular Music\". Since Baila rhythm was popular in Sri Lanka, most of his songs were classified as Tamil Baila.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, women entered the calypso men's-oriented arena. [2] Calypso Rose was the first woman to win the Trinidad Road March competition in 1977 with her song \"Gimme More Tempo\". The following year with \"Come Leh We Jam\", she won the \"Calypso King \" competition, the first time a woman had received the award. The competition's title was changed to Calypso Monarch in her honour.\nThe French and pioneer electronic musician [[Jean Michel Jarre]] released an album in 1990 called ''[[Waiting for Cousteau]]''. The album has four tracks: \"Calypso\", \"Calypso part 2\", \"Calypso part 3 Fin de Si\u00e8cle\" and \"Waiting for Cousteau\". It was dedicated to [[Jacques-Yves Cousteau]] in his 80th birthday. This album had a special participation of the Amocco Renegades (a traditional steel-drum band from [[Trinidad and Tobago]]). In the first track is possible to notice a strong style influence. Calypso had another short burst of commercial interest when [[Tim Burton]]'s horror/comedy film ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' (1988) was released, and used Belafonte's \"[[Jump In The Line (Shake, Senora)|Jump In The Line]]\" as the soundtrack's headliner and also \"The Banana Boat Song\" in the dinner-party scene. [[Disney]]'s song \"[[Under the Sea]]\", a calypso theme from ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] in 1989 as well as the [[Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media]] in 1991.\n\n== Sociopolitical Influence ==\nCalypso music has been used by [[Calypsonian|Calypsonians]] to provide sociopolitical commentary. Prior to the independence of [[Trinidad and Tobago]], calypsonians would use their music to express the daily struggles of living in Trinidad, critique racial and economic inequalities, express opinions on social order, and voice overall concerns for those living on the island.<ref name=\"Blatter\">Blatter, Alfred (2007). ''Revisiting Music Theory: a guide to the practice'', p. 28. {{ISBN|0-415-97440-2}}.</ref> The Black lower class in particular used calypso music to protest inequalities inflicted upon them under British rule and advocate for their rights. In response, calypso music came to exist as a form of musical protest.\n\nDuring the independence movements of Trinidad and Tobago through the earlys 1950s up until 1962 when the nation gained independence, calypso lyrics critiqued British colonial rule. Lyrics were made to express feelings towards colonialism as being immoral and oppressive to Caribbean people. In particular, during the movement to independence, calypso music would include common messages of freedom, anti-colonialism and empowerment of African descended people.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Neville Marcano]], known as the [[Growling Tiger]], became notorious for creating songs calling for independence of Trinidad and Tobago. In his song titled \u201cAbraham Lincoln Speech at Gettysburg\u201d, Tiger used inspirations from [[Abraham Lincoln|Abraham Lincoln's]] famous [[Gettysburg Address|Gettysburg address]] to draw on values of liberty, equality and democracy.<ref name=\":0\" /> These three principles paralleled some of many ideas circulating during the nationalist movement in [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. His lyrics struck with those in support of an independent Trinidadian nation hoping to instill similar principles in their own free nation. \n\n[[Lord Kitchener (calypsonian)|Lord Kitchene]]<nowiki/>r, a largely known Calypsonian, became noted for his politically critical lyrics in his music. Kitchener used calypso to shed light on the grievances of the [[windrush generation]], a generation of Caribbean families migrating from the islands to England in response to increased labor demands after [[World War II]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wardle|first=Huon|last2=Obermuller|first2=Laura|date=2018|title=The Windrush generation|journal=Anthropology Today|language=en|volume=34|issue=4|pages=3\u20134|doi=10.1111/1467-8322.12445|issn=1467-8322}}</ref> Kitchener\u2019s 1948 song \u201cWindrush\u201d was written in two versions. The first version gained more global popularity as the lyrics expressed gratitude and appreciation of British rule. However, second version found greater popularity amongst Caribbean people themselves as the lyrics conveyed a story of exile, oppression and inequality living in England.<ref name=\":0\" /> Although Kitchener\u2019s alternate version of \u201cWindrush\u201d did not gain as much commercial popularity, the duality of the two versions exemplify how calypso music was used as an outlet to challenge colonialism.\n\nAfter Trinidad and Tobago gained independence in 1962, calypso music continued to be used as an outlet for political commentary. With [[Eric Williams]] serving as the first Prime Minister of an independent Trinidad and Tobago, calypsonian [[Mighty Sparrow]] released his song \u201cWilliam the Conqueror\u201d where he praises Williams\u2019 victory and prides the island in its new found independence.<ref name=\":1\" /> Sparrow sings:<blockquote>I am no politician, but I could understand if it wasn\u2019t for Brother Willie and his ability, Trinidad wouldn\u2019t go neither come. We used to vote for food and rum but nowadays we eating all the Indians and them. And in the ending, we voting PNM. Praise little Eric, rejoice and be glad. We have a better future here in Trinidad.<ref name=\":1\" /></blockquote>Calypso music has also been used by politicians to promote political agendas through Calypso competitions. The origins of calypso competitions dates back to the early 19th century post [[emancipation]] where formerly enslaved communities would hold calypso wars showcasing their singing and dancing.<ref name=\":2\" /> Later in 1953 Calypso competitions held the same showcasing nature, but became politicized as the [[People's National Movement|People\u2019s National Movement]] (PNM) took over as the main organizer of competitions.<ref name=\"Blatter\" /> The PNM used the competitions to combat social and class divisions by attracting participants of varying social status to participate and attend the competitions. The idea was to claim a national cultural identity and promote national unity.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Cadence-lypso]]\n* [[Canboulay]]\n* [[Calypso Monarch]]\n* [[Extempo]]\n* [[Soukous]] \n* [[Marrabenta]]\n* [[List of calypso musicians]]\n* [[List of calypso-like genres]]\n* [[List of Caribbean music genres]]\n* [[Mento]], a Jamaican folk music related to Calypso\n* [[Soca music]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* Hill, Donald R.
