It was part of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] network and the first [[German   concentration camp]] liberated by U.S. troops.\n\n==Operation==\nCreated in November 1944 near the town of [[Ohrdruf]], south of [[Gotha]], in [[Thuringia]], Germany, Ohrdruf was initially a separate forced labour camp directly controlled by the ''[[SS-Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt|SS-Wirtschafts- und Verwaltungshauptamt]]'' (SS-WVHA) but then became a subcamp of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] near [[Weimar]]. It made use of huts originally built in 1940 for Wehrmacht troops using the ''Truppen\u00fcbungsplatz'' nearby as well as other facilities. The camp, code-named ''Au\u00dfenlager S III'', consisted of a northern and a southern camp; later, a tent camp at Espenfeld and a camp at Crawinkel were added. The camp supplied forced labor in the form of concentration camp prisoners for railway construction leading to a proposed communications center, which was never completed due to the rapid American advance.<ref name=\"USHMM-Ohrdruf\">{{cite web | title = Ohrdruf | url =http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10006131 | accessdate = 6 August 2014 | location =United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Holocaust Encyclopedia}}</ref><ref name=\"Buchenwald1\">{{cite web | title = Au\u00dfenlager Ohrdruf| url =http://www.buchenwald.de/561/| accessdate = 6 August 2014 | location =Buchenwald.de}}</ref><ref name=\"OTZ\">{{cite web | title = Spurensuche in der \"H\u00f6lle von Ohrdruf\" (German)| url =http://www.otz.de/web/zgt/politik/detail/-/specific/Spurensuche-in-der-Hoelle-von-Ohrdruf-1216823025| accessdate = 6 August 2014 | location =Ostth\u00fcringer Zeitung}}</ref>\n\nBy late 1944, around 10,000 prisoners were housed here; through March 1945, the total number sent here was around 20,000, mainly Russians, Poles, Hungarian Jews, some French, Czechs, Italians, Belgians, Greeks, Yugoslavians and Germans. Conditions were atrocious: in the huts there were no beds, \"only blood-covered straw and lice\". Despite the season, not all prisoners were housed in huts -- some were accommodated in stables, tents and old bunkers. Work days were initially 10 to 11 hours long, then later 14 hours, involving strenuous physical labor building roads, railways and tunnels.

As the American troops advanced towards Ohrdruf, the SS began evacuating almost all prisoners on death marches to Buchenwald on April 1.

It was stopped when some of its occupants noticed a group of buildings in the distance. Lt. William J. Miller of the 89th Infantry Division was ordered to take his platoon and a tank and investigate.  When he got to the camp, the main gate was locked shut.  He ordered the tank to crash through the gate.  When the soldiers of the 4th Armored Division and the 89th Infantry Division entered the camp, they discovered piles of bodies, some covered with lime, and others partially incinerated on pyres. Lt. Miller ordered German residents from a nearby hamlet to tour the inside of the camp. <ref></ref>The ghastly nature of their discovery led General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[Supreme Allied Commander|Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe]], to visit the camp on April 12, with Generals [[George S. Patton]] and [[Omar Bradley]]. After his visit, Eisenhower cabled General [[George C. Marshall]], the head of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] in Washington, describing his trip to Ohrdruf:<ref name=\"USHMM-Ohrdruf\"/>\n\n<blockquote>... the most interesting\u2014although horrible\u2014sight that I encountered during the trip was a visit to a German internment camp near Gotha. The things I saw beggar description. While I was touring the camp I encountered three men who had been inmates and by one ruse or another had made their escape. I interviewed them through an interpreter. The visual evidence and the verbal testimony of starvation, cruelty and bestiality were so overpowering as to leave me a bit sick. In one room, where they were piled up twenty or thirty naked men, killed by starvation, George Patton would not even enter. He said that he would get sick if he did so. I made the visit deliberately, in order to be in a position to give first-hand evidence of these things if ever, in the future, there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to 'propaganda.'</blockquote>\n\n==Impact on Allies==\nSeeing the Nazi crimes committed at Ohrdruf made a powerful impact on Eisenhower, and he wanted the world to know what happened in the concentration camps. On April 19, 1945, he again cabled Marshall with a request to bring members of Congress and journalists to the newly liberated camps so that they could bring the horrible truth about German Nazi atrocities to the American public. That same day, Marshall received permission from the [[Secretary of War]], [[Henry Lewis Stimson]], and President [[Harry S. Truman]] for these delegations to visit the liberated camps.<ref name=\"USHMM-Ohrdruf\"/>\n\nOhrdruf had also made a powerful impression on Patton, who described it as \"one of the most appalling sights that I have ever seen.\" He recounted in his diary that:<ref name=\"USHMM-Ohrdruf\"/>\n\n<blockquote>In a shed ... was a pile of about 40 completely naked human bodies in the last stages of emaciation. These bodies were lightly sprinkled with lime, not for the purposes of destroying them, but for the purpose of removing the stench.\n\nWhen the shed was full\u2014I presume its capacity to be about 200, the bodies were taken to a pit a mile from the camp where they were buried. The inmates claimed that 3,000 men, who had been either shot in the head or who had died of starvation, had been so buried since the 1st of January.\n\nWhen we began to approach with our troops, the Germans thought it expedient to remove the evidence of their crime. Therefore, they had some of the slaves exhume the bodies and place them on a mammoth griddle composed of 60-centimeter railway tracks laid on brick foundations. They poured pitch on the bodies and then built a fire of pinewood and coal under them. They were not very successful in their operations because there was a pile of human bones, skulls, charred torsos on or under the griddle which must have accounted for many hundreds.</blockquote>\n\n==Later use==\nThe military training area of ''Truppen\u00fcbungsplatz Ohrdruf'' was taken over in July 1945 by the [[Red Army]], since [[Thuringia]] became part of the Soviet occupation zone. The ''Nordlager'' was razed. Two memorials to the dead were erected at around this time.
