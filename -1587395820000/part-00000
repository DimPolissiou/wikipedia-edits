This tractate discusses the laws of [[Heave offering|teruma]],  a gift of produce that an Israelite farmer was required to set aside and give to a [[Kohen|''kohen'' (priest)]]. There were two kinds of ''terumot'' given to the priest: the regular heave-offering, known also as the ''terumah gedolah'' (\"great heave-offering\"), which the Israelites were required to give to the priest from the produce of their fields; the other was the ''terumat ma'aser'' (\"tithe of the heave-offering\"), namely, the gift that the [[Levites]] were required to put aside for the priests from [[Maaser Rishon|the tithe]] which ordinary Israelites had been required to give to them.\n\nThe laws detailed in this tractate are derived from the [[Torah]] in {{bibleverse||Numbers|18:8, 11-12|HE}} and {{bibleverse||Deut|18:4-5|HE}}, and for ''terumat ma'aser'' from {{bibleverse||Numbers|18:25-32|HE}}.\n\nThe [[Mitzvah|mitzvah (commandment)]] applies only to produce grown in the [[Land of Israel]] and continues to be observed in the modern state of [[Israel]].\n\nThis tractate comprises eleven chapters in the Mishna and ten in the [[Tosefta]] and has fifty-nine folio pages of [[Gemara]] in the [[Jerusalem Talmud]]. Like most tractates in the order of ''Zeraim'', there is no [[Babylonian Talmud]] for this tractate. Laws concerning terumah are also mentioned in the tractates ''[[Demai (tractate)|Demai]]'' and ''[[Ma'aserot]]''.\n\n==Subject matter==\n{{See|Tithes in Judaism}}\n{{rquote|1=right|2=\"The first-fruits of your grain, of your wine, and of your oil, and the first of the fleece of your sheep, you shall give him.

The Levites were required to  separate and give the priest one-tenth of the tithe that they received from the Israelite farmers and this was called [[Terumat Ma'aser|''terumat ma'aser'']] (\"offering of the tithe\"), or ''ma\u2019aser min hama\u2019aser'' (tithe of the tithe). The Israelites, on the other hand, separated the ''terumah gedolah'' to be given to the priests before they separated a tenth of the produce to be given as tithe to the Levites. Both types of gifts come under the general term of ''terumah'', which forms the theme of this tractate, but the ''terumah gedolah'' of the Israelite farmers comprises the main subject of discussion. <ref name=Kehati/><ref name=Birnbaum/><ref name=Soncino/><ref name=JE2>{{Jewish Encyclopedia |inline=1|wstitle= Terumot }}</ref><ref name=JE1>{{cite web|title=Terumot|website=JewishEncyclopedia.com|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14342-terumot|access-date=2019-09-09}}</ref>\n\nThe Torah does not specify the amount of ''terumah'' that must be given, and theoretically, even one single kernel of grain could suffice; thus the Mishna in this tractate establishes an amount, from one-fortieth to one-sixtieth of the gross product, depending on the circumstances and generosity of the individual farmer, with one-fiftieth being regarded as the average gift. The generally accepted measure is therefore one-fiftieth, and [[Chazal|the Sages]] found an allusion to this amount in the term ''terumah'' as an acronym of the [[Talmudic Aramaic|Aramaic]] words ''trei mi-meah'' (\"two from a hundred\") or 2%.<ref name=Kehati/><ref name=Soncino/><ref name=Lipman>{{cite book |last1=Lipman |first1=Eugene |title=The Mishna: Oral Teachings of  Judaism |date=1970 |publisher=W.

Thus, for example, before the ''terumah'' is separated, all the produce is ''tevel'' (untithed) and forbidden to be eaten. ''Terumah'' is considered holy, and may be eaten by priests only, as prescribed  in Leviticus 22:10, and must be guarded against becoming [[Tumah and taharah|ritually unclean]], lost or wasted, as interpreted from Numbers 18:8. The Mishna also considers what to do in cases where ''terumah'' became mixed with non-sacred food; if the ratio is less than one hundred times that of ''terumah'', it determines that all of it becomes forbidden to non-priests. However, it is not necessary to give the mixture to the priest, rather it is sold to a priest at the price of ''terumah'', which was fixed lower than ordinary produce, while deducting the value of the ''terumah'' mixed into it. If the ratio of non-sacred food exceeds one hundred-times than that of the ''terumah'',  a non-priest may eat it, after removing the quantity of the ''terumah'' that had fallen into it and giving it to the priest.<ref name=Kehati/><ref name=Soncino/>\n\n==Structure and content==\nThe tractate consists of eleven chapters and 101 paragraphs (''mishnayot''). It has a [[Gemara]] \u2013 rabbinical analysis of and commentary on the Mishnah \u2013 of 59 double-sided pages in the [[Jerusalem Talmud]]. There is a [[Tosefta]] of ten chapters for this tractate.<ref name=Birnbaum/><ref name=JE2/>\n\nThere is no Gemara in the [[Babylonian Talmud]] for this tractate, or indeed for any of the tractates of [[Seder Zeraim|this order of the Mishnah]], other than [[Tractate Berakhot]], as the laws related to agriculture and produce that are mostly discussed in this order generally have no practical application outside of the [[Land of Israel]].\n\nIn most editions of the Mishnah, this tractate is sixth in the order Zera'im. [[Maimonides]], in his ''Commentary on the Mishnah'', states that this tractate follows [[Shevi'it]] since ''terumah'' is the first gift which one separates from the produce.<ref name=Kehati/><ref name=JE2/>\n\nAn overview of the topics of the chapters is as follows:<ref name=Soncino/><ref name=JE2/>\n\n* Chapter 1 discusses the categories of people who may not set aside ''terumah'' and the different cases in which ''terumah'' is considered valid even if the method by which it was selected was generally not permissible.\n\n* Chapter 2 deals with additional cases in which the ''terumah'' is valid, if the method of selecting it was unknowingly incorrect.\n\n* Chapter 3 examines when ''terumah'' had to be given twice, the authority of an owner to delegate a servant to take ''terumah'', in what order various offerings, such as ''[[Terumah|terumah]]'' and [[Tithes in Judaism|the tithe]] are to be given, and  the procedure to be followed if someone makes a verbal error while selecting the ''terumah'' or during the [[Korban|consecration of a sacrifice]] or [[Neder|taking of an oath]].\n\n* Chapter 4 deals with the amount of the ''terumah gedolah'' offered by the Israelite and with the ''terumat ma\u2019aser'' of the Levite, which must be given according to measure, and situations where ''terumah'' has been mixed with other produce.\n\n* Chapter 5 continues the discussion of handling mixtures, in these cases of [[Tumah and taharah|ritually clean and unclean]] produce for ''terumah''.\n\n* Chapter 6 deals with the compensation that must be made for improperly eating or deriving benefit from ''terumah''.\n\n* Chapter 7 concerns further cases of mixtures and cases when both the value and an additional fifth of the value had to be repaid on eating ''terumah''.\n\n* Chapter 8 continues the topic of mixtures and introduces the subject of the wine of ''terumah'' that had been left uncovered and the dangers of poisoning, and the prohibition against intentionally defiling the ''terumah'', along with other situations of defilement.\n\n* Chapter 9 defines the process to follow when ''terumah'' has been deliberately or unintentionally sown and rules concerning the handling of produce grown from the sowing of ''terumah'' grains or fruit.\n\n* Chapter 10 enumerates the cases in which the flavor of ''terumah'' makes other foods forbidden and other rules about which permissible foods become forbidden through the flavor acquired from prohibited foods. \n\n* Chapter 11 discusses the uses that may be made of [[Tumah and taharah|ritually clean and unclean]] ''terumah'' both in solid and in liquid forms.\n\n==Historical context and influence==\nThe commandment of ''terumah'' applies only to produce grown in the [[Land of Israel]] and continues to be observed in the modern state of [[Israel]]. There is debate among [[Poskim|Jewish legal authorities]] as to whether the present-day [[Halakha|Jewish religious laws]] detailed in this tractate are now [[List of Talmudic principles#De'oraita and Derabanan|biblically or rabbinically mandated]] obligations.<ref name=AS>{{cite book |editor1-last=Scherman |editor1-first=Nosson |editor2-last=Zlotowitz |editor2-first=Meir |title=The Mishna Artscroll Series, Seder Zeraim, Tractate Terumos, Vol IV(a) |date=2002 |publisher=Mesorah Publications, Ltd |location=New York |pages=9-11}}</ref>\n\nMishna 8:12 of this tractate is a digression from the laws of ''terumah'' but is included in this tractate because it contains a similar case to the preceding mishna about pagans intent on defilement \u2013 in the previous mishna of a commodity and in this, of a person. This mishna has become a source of Jewish law for the general principle that it is not permitted to sacrifice one individual to save other. Tosefta 7:23 of this tractate, quoted in the Jerusalem Talmud ({{Cite Talmud|y|Terumot||47a}}) expands the ruling of the mishna to a case where if one member of a group is not delivered to be killed, the entire group will be killed. The ruling is the same as in the mishna, that all should die rather than sacrifice one to save the others. However, if one individual was specified by the persecutors, then other factors can be considered, such as whether that individual is already subject to capital punishment for a crime they have committed.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Scherman |editor1-first=Nosson |editor2-last=Zlotowitz |editor2-first=Meir |title=The Mishna Artscroll Series, Seder Zeraim, Tractate Terumos, Vol IV(a) |date=2002 |publisher=Mesorah Publications, Ltd |location=New York |pages=363-364}}</ref> Many medieval and modern [[Posek|Jewish legal scholars]] have grappled with the practical applications of the cases mentioned in this tractate, often when facing situations involving persecution, in the Middle Ages [[Rhineland massacres|during the Crusades]], the [[Rintfleisch massacres]] or other [[pogrom|anti-Jewish violence]], and in modern times during [[the Holocaust]].<ref name=Lipman2>{{cite book |last1=Lipman |first1=Eugene |title=The Mishna: Oral Teachings of  Judaism |date=1970 |publisher=W.

The generally accepted measure is therefore one-fiftieth, and [[Chazal|the Sages]] found an allusion to this amount in the term ''terumah'' as an acronym of the [[Talmudic Aramaic|Aramaic]] words ''trei mi-meah'' (\"two from a hundred\") or 2%.<ref name=Kehati/><ref name=Soncino/><ref name=Lipman>{{cite book |last1=Lipman |first1=Eugene |title=The Mishna: Oral Teachings of  Judaism |date=1970 |publisher=W. W. Norton & Company |location=New York |isbn= |pages=58-59 |chapter=Terumot\u2014Heave-Offerings}}</ref>\n\nThe tractate deals with the details of many circumstances which could arise with regards to the ''terumah''. Thus, for example, before the ''terumah'' is separated, all the produce is ''tevel'' (untithed) and forbidden to be eaten. ''Terumah'' is considered holy, and may be eaten by priests only, as prescribed  in Leviticus 22:10, and must be guarded against becoming [[Tumah and taharah|ritually unclean]], lost or wasted, as interpreted from Numbers 18:8. The Mishna also considers what to do in cases where ''terumah'' became mixed with non-sacred food; if the ratio is less than one hundred times that of ''terumah'', it determines that all of it becomes forbidden to non-priests. However, it is not necessary to give the mixture to the priest, rather it is sold to a priest at the price of ''terumah'', which was fixed lower than ordinary produce, while deducting the value of the ''terumah'' mixed into it. If the ratio of non-sacred food exceeds one hundred-times than that of the ''terumah'',  a non-priest may eat it, after removing the quantity of the ''terumah'' that had fallen into it and giving it to the priest.<ref name=Kehati/><ref name=Soncino/>\n\n==Structure and content==\nThe tractate consists of eleven chapters and 101 paragraphs (''mishnayot''). It has a [[Gemara]] \u2013 rabbinical analysis of and commentary on the Mishnah \u2013 of 59 double-sided pages in the [[Jerusalem Talmud]]. There is a [[Tosefta]] of ten chapters for this tractate.<ref name=Birnbaum/><ref name=JE2/>\n\nThere is no Gemara in the [[Babylonian Talmud]] for this tractate, or indeed for any of the tractates of [[Seder Zeraim|this order of the Mishnah]], other than [[Tractate Berakhot]], as the laws related to agriculture and produce that are mostly discussed in this order generally have no practical application outside of the [[Land of Israel]].\n\nIn most editions of the Mishnah, this tractate is sixth in the order Zera'im. [[Maimonides]], in his ''Commentary on the Mishnah'', states that this tractate follows [[Shevi'it]] since ''terumah'' is the first gift which one separates from the produce.<ref name=Kehati/><ref name=JE2/>\n\nAn overview of the topics of the chapters is as follows:<ref name=Soncino/><ref name=JE2/>\n\n* Chapter 1 discusses the categories of people who may not set aside ''terumah'' and the different cases in which ''terumah'' is considered valid even if the method by which it was selected was generally not permissible.\n\n* Chapter 2 deals with additional cases in which the ''terumah'' is valid, if the method of selecting it was unknowingly incorrect.\n\n* Chapter 3 examines when ''terumah'' had to be given twice, the authority of an owner to delegate a servant to take ''terumah'', in what order various offerings, such as ''[[Terumah|terumah]]'' and [[Tithes in Judaism|the tithe]] are to be given, and  the procedure to be followed if someone makes a verbal error while selecting the ''terumah'' or during the [[Korban|consecration of a sacrifice]] or [[Neder|taking of an oath]].\n\n* Chapter 4 deals with the amount of the ''terumah gedolah'' offered by the Israelite and with the ''terumat ma\u2019aser'' of the Levite, which must be given according to measure, and situations where ''terumah'' has been mixed with other produce.\n\n* Chapter 5 continues the discussion of handling mixtures, in these cases of [[Tumah and taharah|ritually clean and unclean]] produce for ''terumah''.\n\n* Chapter 6 deals with the compensation that must be made for improperly eating or deriving benefit from ''terumah''.\n\n* Chapter 7 concerns further cases of mixtures and cases when both the value and an additional fifth of the value had to be repaid on eating ''terumah''.\n\n* Chapter 8 continues the topic of mixtures and introduces the subject of the wine of ''terumah'' that had been left uncovered and the dangers of poisoning, and the prohibition against intentionally defiling the ''terumah'', along with other situations of defilement.\n\n* Chapter 9 defines the process to follow when ''terumah'' has been deliberately or unintentionally sown and rules concerning the handling of produce grown from the sowing of ''terumah'' grains or fruit.\n\n* Chapter 10 enumerates the cases in which the flavor of ''terumah'' makes other foods forbidden and other rules about which permissible foods become forbidden through the flavor acquired from prohibited foods. \n\n* Chapter 11 discusses the uses that may be made of [[Tumah and taharah|ritually clean and unclean]] ''terumah'' both in solid and in liquid forms.\n\n==Historical context and influence==\nThe commandment of ''terumah'' applies only to produce grown in the [[Land of Israel]] and continues to be observed in the modern state of [[Israel]]. There is debate among [[Poskim|Jewish legal authorities]] as to whether the present-day [[Halakha|Jewish religious laws]] detailed in this tractate are now [[List of Talmudic principles#De'oraita and Derabanan|biblically or rabbinically mandated]] obligations.<ref name=AS>{{cite book |editor1-last=Scherman |editor1-first=Nosson |editor2-last=Zlotowitz |editor2-first=Meir |title=The Mishna Artscroll Series, Seder Zeraim, Tractate Terumos, Vol IV(a) |date=2002 |publisher=Mesorah Publications, Ltd |location=New York |pages=9-11}}</ref>\n\nMishna 8:12 of this tractate is a digression from the laws of ''terumah'' but is included in this tractate because it contains a similar case to the preceding mishna about pagans intent on defilement \u2013 in the previous mishna of a commodity and in this, of a person. This mishna has become a source of Jewish law for the general principle that it is not permitted to sacrifice one individual to save other. Tosefta 7:23 of this tractate, quoted in the Jerusalem Talmud ({{Cite Talmud|y|Terumot||47a}}) expands the ruling of the mishna to a case where if one member of a group is not delivered to be killed, the entire group will be killed. The ruling is the same as in the mishna, that all should die rather than sacrifice one to save the others. However, if one individual was specified by the persecutors, then other factors can be considered, such as whether that individual is already subject to capital punishment for a crime they have committed.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Scherman |editor1-first=Nosson |editor2-last=Zlotowitz |editor2-first=Meir |title=The Mishna Artscroll Series, Seder Zeraim, Tractate Terumos, Vol IV(a) |date=2002 |publisher=Mesorah Publications, Ltd |location=New York |pages=363-364}}</ref> Many medieval and modern [[Posek|Jewish legal scholars]] have grappled with the practical applications of the cases mentioned in this tractate, often when facing situations involving persecution, in the Middle Ages [[Rhineland massacres|during the Crusades]], the [[Rintfleisch massacres]] or other [[pogrom|anti-Jewish violence]], and in modern times during [[the Holocaust]].<ref name=Lipman2>{{cite book |last1=Lipman |first1=Eugene |title=The Mishna: Oral Teachings of  Judaism |date=1970 |publisher=W.
