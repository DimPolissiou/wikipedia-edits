Retrieved 25 February 2009.</ref> This was the [[New York and Harlem Railroad]]'s [[Fourth Avenue Line (Manhattan surface)|Fourth Avenue Line]] which ran along the [[Bowery]] and [[Fourth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fourth Avenue]] in New York City. These trams were an animal railway, usually using [[horse]]s and sometimes [[mule]]s to haul the cars, usually two as a team. Rarely, other animals were tried, including humans in emergency circumstances. It was followed in 1835 by [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], which is the oldest continuously operating street railway system in the world, according to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.<!--what line?--><ref name=\"Bellis\">{{cite web|last = Bellis|first = Mary|title =  History of Streetcars and Cable Cars|url = http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blstreetcars.htm|accessdate = 2007-01-10}}</ref>\n\nThe first tram in Continental Europe opened in France in 1839 between [[Montbrison, Loire|Montbrison]] and [[Montrond-les-Bains|Montrond]], on the streets inside the towns, and on the roadside outside town. It had permission for steam traction, but was entirely run with horse traction. In 1848, it was closed down after repeated economic failure.  The tram developed in numerous cities of Europe (some of the most extensive systems were found in Berlin, [[Budapest]], [[Birmingham Corporation Tramways|Birmingham]], [[Leningrad]], [[Lisbon]], [[London County Council Tramways|London]],  [[Manchester Corporation Tramways|Manchester]], [[Tramways in Paris#History|Paris]]).\n\nThe first tram in South America opened in 1858 in [[List of town tramway systems in Chile|Santiago, Chile]]. The first trams in Australia opened in 1860 in [[Trams in Sydney|Sydney]]. Africa's first tram service started in [[Trams in Alexandria|Alexandria]] on 8 January 1863. The first trams in Asia opened in 1869 in [[Trams in Asia|Batavia (now Jakarta), Netherlands East Indies (now Indonesia)]].\n\nProblems with horsecars included the fact that any given animal could only work so many hours on a given day, had to be housed, groomed, fed and cared for day in and day out, and produced prodigious amounts of manure, which the streetcar company was charged with storing and then disposing. Since a typical horse pulled a streetcar for about a dozen miles a day and worked for four or five hours, many systems needed ten or more horses in stable for each horsecar.\n\nHorsecars were largely replaced by electric-powered trams following the improvement of an overhead trolley system on trams for collecting electricity from [[overhead wire]]s by [[Frank J. Sprague]]. His spring-loaded [[trolley pole]] used a wheel to travel along the wire. In late 1887 and early 1888, using his trolley system, Sprague installed the first successful large electric street railway system in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. Within a year, the economy of electric power had replaced more costly horsecars in many cities. By 1889, 110 electric railways incorporating Sprague's equipment had been begun or planned on several continents.<ref name=\"siemens.com\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.siemens.com/history/en/innovations/transportation.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=5 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729124510/https://www.siemens.com/history/en/innovations/transportation.htm |archive-date=29 July 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nHorses continued to be used for light shunting well into the 20th century.

The \"van\" now lies at the Ulster Transport Museum.\n\nHorse-drawn trams still operate on the 1876-built [[Douglas Bay Horse Tramway]] in the [[Isle of Man]], and at the 1894-built [[Victor Harbor Horse Drawn Tram]], in Adelaide, South Australia. New horse-drawn systems have been established at the [[Hokkaid\u014d]] Museum in Japan and also in [[Disneyland]].\n\n==Steam==\n{{See also|Tram engine|Steam dummy}}\n[[File:Bruehl Feuriger Elias.jpg|thumb|right|A German steam tram engine from the [[Cologne Stadtbahn|Cologne-Bonn railway]], pulling a train through [[Br\u00fchl (Rhineland)|Br\u00fchl]] marketplace, around 1900]]\n\nThe first mechanical trams were powered by [[steam engine|steam]]. Generally, there were two types of steam tram. The first and most common had a small [[steam locomotive]] (called a [[tram engine]] in the UK) at the head of a line of one or more carriages, similar to a small train. Systems with such steam trams included [[Christchurch]], New Zealand; [[Trams in Adelaide|Adelaide]], [[South Australia]]; Sydney, Australia and other city systems in [[New South Wales]]; [[Munich]], Germany (from August 1883 on),<ref name=Muenchen1964>{{cite news| url = http://www.tram-muenchen.de/geschichte/chronik-vor1964.html| title = 1876 \u2013 1964 (\u00dcberblick)| archiveurl = https://archive.is/20110224053241/http://www.tram-muenchen.de/geschichte/chronik-vor1964.html| archivedate = 24 February 2011| accessdate = 2015-03-08| url-status = dead}}</ref> [[Mohamedali Tramways Company|British India (Pakistan)]] (from 1885) and the Dublin & Blessington Steam Tramway (from 1888) in Ireland. Steam tramways also were used on the suburban tramway lines around [[Milan]] and [[Padua]]; the last ''Gamba de Legn'' (\"Peg-Leg\") tramway ran on the Milan-[[Magenta]]-Castano Primo route in late 1958.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nThe other style of steam tram had the steam engine in the body of the tram, referred to as a [[tram engine]] (UK) or [[steam dummy]] (US). The most notable system to adopt such trams was in Paris. French-designed steam trams also operated in [[Rockhampton, Queensland|Rockhampton]], in the Australian state of [[Queensland]] between 1909 and 1939. [[Stockholm]], Sweden, had a steam tram line at the island of [[S\u00f6dermalm]] between 1887 and 1901.\n\nTram engines usually had modifications to make them suitable for street running in residential areas. The wheels, and other moving parts of the machinery, were usually enclosed for safety reasons and to make the engines quieter. Measures were often taken to prevent the engines from emitting visible smoke or steam. Usually the engines used [[coke (fuel)|coke]] rather than coal as fuel to avoid emitting smoke; [[Condensing steam locomotive|condensers]] or [[Superheater|superheating]] were used to avoid emitting visible steam. A major drawback of this style of tram was the limited space for the engine, so that these trams were usually underpowered. Steam tram engines faded out around 1890s to 1900s, being replaced by electric trams.\n\n==Cable-hauled==\n{{Main|Cable car (railway)}}\n[[Image:Minories stationLBR.jpg|thumb|Winding drums on the [[London and Blackwall Railway|London and Blackwall]] cable-operated railway, 1840]]\n[[File:11 Cable Car on Powell St crop, SF, CA, jjron 25.03.2012.jpg|thumb|A [[San Francisco cable car system|San Francisco cable car]]: a cable pulled system, still operating {{as of|2017|lc=y}}]]\n\nAnother motive system for trams was the cable car, which was pulled along a [[rail track|fixed track]] by a moving steel cable. The power to move the cable was normally provided at a \"powerhouse\" site a distance away from the actual vehicle.\n\nThe [[London and Blackwall Railway]], which opened for passengers in east London, England, in 1840 used such a system.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Robertson|first=Andrew|date=March 1848|title=Blackwall Railway Machinery|journal=The Civil engineer and architect's journal|publisher=Wiley & Putnam|location=New York|volume=11}}</ref>\n\nThe first practical cable car line was tested in [[San Francisco cable car system|San Francisco]], in 1873. Part of its success is attributed to the development of an effective and reliable [[cable grip]] mechanism, to grab and release the moving cable without damage. The second city to operate cable trams was [[Dunedin cable tramway system|Dunedin]] in New Zealand, from 1881 to 1957.\n\nThe most extensive cable system in the US was built in [[Chicago City Railway|Chicago]] between 1882 and 1906.<ref>{{cite book|last=Borzo|first=Greg|title=Chicago Cable Cars|year=2012|publisher=The History Press|lccn=|isbn=978-1-60949-327-1|pages=15\u201321}}</ref>{{when|date=March 2013}} New York City developed at least seven cable car lines.{{when|date=March 2013}} Los Angeles also had several cable car lines, including the Second Street Cable Railroad, which operated from 1885 to 1889, and the Temple Street Cable Railway, which operated from 1886 to 1898.\n\n[[File:Melbourne cable tram 1905.jpg|thumb|Cable tram dummy and trailer on the [[Melbourne tram route 96|St. Kilda Line]] in Melbourne in 1905.]]\n[[File:(Looking north along George Street (with tram, T-model Ford and hansom cab) from Union Line Building (incorporating the Bjelke-Petersen School of Physical culture), corner Jamieson Street), n.d. by (5955844045).jpg|thumb|right|Trams on [[George Street, Sydney]], circa 1919-20. Sydney once had the largest tram network in the world.]]\nFrom 1885 to 1940, the city of [[Melbourne cable tramway system|Melbourne]], Victoria, Australia operated one of the largest cable systems in the world, at its peak running 592 trams on {{convert|75|km|mi}} of track, though during its heyday, [[Trams in Sydney|Sydney's network was larger]],<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FowEWGlvOKk From ABC-TV's 'Can you help?'. Sydney, the largest city in Australia, once had the largest tram system in Australia, the second largest in the Commonwealth (after London), and one of the largest in the world. In the early 1960s the entire network was dismantled.]</ref> with about 1,600 cars in service at any one time at its peak during the 1930s (cf. about 500 trams in Melbourne today). There were also two isolated cable lines in Sydney, the North Sydney line from 1886 to 1900,<ref>[[Trams in Sydney]]</ref> and the King Street line from 1892 to 1905. Sydney's tram network ceased to serve the city population by the 1960s, with all tracks being removed, in lieu of a bus service. Melbourne's tram network, however, continues to run to this day.\n\nIn [[Dresden]], Germany, in 1901 an elevated [[suspension railway|suspended]] cable car following the ''Eugen Langen one-railed floating tram system'' started operating. Cable cars operated on [[Highgate Hill]] in North London and [[Kennington]] to [[Brixton]] Hill In South London.{{when|date=March 2013}} They also worked around \"Upper Douglas\" in the [[Isle of Man]] from 1897 to 1929 (cable car 72/73 is the sole survivor of the fleet).\n\nCable cars suffered from high [[infrastructure]] costs, since an expensive system of [[Wire rope|cables]], [[pulley]]s, [[stationary engine]]s and lengthy underground vault structures beneath the rails had to be provided. They also required physical strength and skill to operate, and alert operators to avoid obstructions and other cable cars. The cable had to be disconnected (\"dropped\") at designated locations to allow the cars to coast by inertia, for example when crossing another cable line. The cable would then have to be \"picked up\" to resume progress, the whole operation requiring precise timing to avoid damage to the cable and the grip mechanism. Breaks and frays in the cable, which occurred frequently, required the complete cessation of services over a cable route while the cable was repaired. Due to overall wear, the entire length of cable (typically several kilometres) would have to be replaced on a regular schedule. After the development of reliable electrically powered trams, the costly high-maintenance cable car systems were rapidly replaced in most locations.\n\nCable cars remained especially effective in hilly cities, since their nondriven wheels would not [[rail adhesion|lose traction]] as they climbed or descended a steep hill. The moving cable would physically pull the car up the hill at a steady pace, unlike a low-powered steam or horse-drawn car. Cable cars do have wheel brakes and [[track brake]]s, but the cable also helps restrain the car to going downhill at a constant speed. Performance in steep terrain partially explains the survival of cable cars in San Francisco.\n\nThe [[San Francisco cable car system|San Francisco cable cars]], though significantly reduced in number, continue to perform a regular transportation function, in addition to being a well-known [[tourist attraction]]. A single cable line also survives in [[Wellington]], New Zealand (rebuilt in 1979 as a [[funicular]] but still called the \"[[Wellington Cable Car]]\"). Another system, actually two separate cable lines with a shared power station in the middle, operates from the Welsh town of [[Llandudno]] up to the top of the [[Great Orme]] hill in [[North Wales]], UK.\n\n==Gas==\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries a number of systems in various parts of the world employed trams powered by gas, [[naphtha]] gas or [[coal gas]] in particular. Gas trams are known to have operated between [[Alphington, Victoria|Alphington]] and [[Clifton Hill, Victoria|Clifton Hill]] in the northern suburbs of [[Melbourne]], Australia (1886\u20131888); in Berlin and [[Dresden]], Germany; in [[Estonia]] (1920s\u20131930); between [[Jelenia G\u00f3ra]], [[Jelenia G\u00f3ra|Cieplice]], and [[Sobiesz\u00f3w]] in Poland (from 1897); and in the UK at [[Lytham St Annes]], [[Neath]] (1896\u20131920), and [[Trafford Park]], Manchester (1897\u20131908).\n\nOn 29 December 1886 the Melbourne newspaper ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]'' reprinted a report from the [[San Francisco Bulletin]] that Mr Noble had demonstrated a new 'motor car' for tramways 'with success'. The tramcar 'exactly similar in size, shape, and capacity to a cable grip car' had the 'motive power' of gas 'with which the reservoir is to be charged once a day at power stations by means of a rubber hose'. The car also carried an electricity generator for 'lighting up the tram and also for driving the engine on steep grades and effecting a start'.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article11584473 |title=WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 29, 1886. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=29 December 1886 |accessdate=10 March 2013 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nComparatively little has been published about gas trams.

This two kilometer line, re-gauged to {{convert|2|ft|9|in|mm}} in 1884, remains in service to this day, and is the oldest operating electric tramway in the world. Also in 1883, [[M\u00f6dling and Hinterbr\u00fchl Tram]] was opened near [[Vienna]] in Austria. It was the first tram in the world in regular service that was run with electricity served by an overhead line with pantograph current collectors. The [[Blackpool Tramway]], was opened in Blackpool, UK on 29 September 1885 using conduit collection along Blackpool Promenade. This system is still in operation in a modernised form.\n\nEarliest tram system in Canada was by [[John Joseph Wright]], brother of the famous mining entrepreneur [[Whitaker Wright]], in [[Toronto]] in 1883. In the US, multiple functioning experimental [[Tram#Electric (trolley cars)|electric trams]] were exhibited at the 1884 [[World Cotton Centennial]] World's Fair in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], but they were not deemed good enough to replace the [[Emile Lamm|Lamm]] fireless engines then propelling the [[St. Charles Avenue Streetcar]] in that city. The first commercial installation of an electric streetcar in the United States was built in 1884 in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] and operated for a period of one year by the East Cleveland Street Railway Company.<ref>{{cite web|last=American Public Transportation Association |title=Milestones in U.S. Public Transportation History |url=http://apta.com/research/stats/history/mileston.cfm |accessdate=2013-03-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303212350/http://apta.com/research/stats/history/mileston.cfm |archivedate=3 March 2009 }}</ref> Trams were operated in  [[Richmond, Virginia]], in 1888, on the [[Richmond Union Passenger Railway]] built by [[Frank J.

This gave birth to the modern subway train. Following the improvement of an overhead trolley system on streetcars for collecting electricity from [[overhead wire]]s by [[Frank J. Sprague]], electric tram systems were rapidly adopted across the world.\n\nEarlier installations proved difficult or unreliable. Siemens' line, for example, provided power through a live rail and a return rail, like a [[model train]], limiting the [[voltage]] that could be used, and providing electric shocks to people and animals crossing the tracks.<ref>{{cite web|last = Wood|first = E.

By the 1970s, the only tramway system remaining in Australia was the Melbourne tram system other than a few single lines remaining elsewhere: the [[Glenelg Tram]], connecting Adelaide to the beachside suburb of [[Glenelg, South Australia|Glenelg]], and tourist trams in the Victorian [[Goldfields region of Victoria|Goldfields]] cities of Bendigo and Ballarat. In recent years the Melbourne system, generally recognised as one of the largest in the world, has been considerably modernised and expanded. The Adelaide line has also been extended to the Entertainment Centre, and there are plans to expand further.\n\nIn Japan, the Kyoto Electric railroad was the first tram system, starting operation in 1895.<ref>[http://www.city.kyoto.jp/koho/eng/historical/first/04.html Kyoto Tram from Kyoto City Web].

Retrieved 12 February 2009.</ref>  By the 1960s the tram had generally died out in Japan.\n\nTwo rare but significant alternatives were [[conduit current collection]], which was widely used in London, Washington, D.C. and New York City, and the [[Stud contact system|surface contact collection]] method, used in [[Wolverhampton]] (the Lorain system), [[Torquay Tramways|Torquay]] and [[Hastings]] in the UK (the Dolter stud system), and currently in [[Tramway de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]], France (the [[ground-level power supply]] system).\n\nThe convenience and economy of electricity resulted in its rapid adoption once the technical problems of production and transmission of electricity were solved. Electric trams largely replaced animal power and other forms of motive power including cable and steam, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nThere is one particular hazard associated with trams powered from a trolley off an overhead line. Since the tram relies on contact with the rails for the current return path, a problem arises if the tram is derailed or (more usually) if it halts on a section of track that has been particularly heavily sanded by a previous tram, and the tram loses electrical contact with the rails. In this event, the underframe of the tram, by virtue of a circuit path through ancillary loads (such as saloon lighting), is live at the full supply voltage, typically 600 volts. In British terminology such a tram was said to be \u2018grounded\u2019\u2014not to be confused with the US English use of the term, which means the exact opposite. Any person stepping off the tram completed the earth return circuit and could receive a nasty electric shock. In such an event the driver was required to jump off the tram (avoiding simultaneous contact with the tram and the ground) and pull down the trolley before allowing passengers off the tram. Unless derailed, the tram could usually be recovered by running water down the running rails from a point higher than the tram. The water providing a conducting bridge between the tram and the rails.\n\nIn the 2000s, two companies introduced catenary-free designs. Alstom's Citadis line uses a third rail, and Bombardier's PRIMOVE LRV is charged by contactless induction plates embedded in the trackway.<ref>[http://www.thetransportpolitic.wordpress.com/2009/01/22/bombardier-presents-new-catenary-free-streetcar/ Wordpress.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129082418/http://thetransportpolitic.wordpress.com/2009/01/22/bombardier-presents-new-catenary-free-streetcar/ |date=29 January 2009 }}, \"The transport politic\"</ref>\n\n===Battery===\n\nAs early as 1834, [[Thomas Davenport (inventor)|Thomas Davenport]], a Vermont blacksmith, had invented a battery-powered electric motor which he later patented.

The first trams in [[Bendigo]], Australia, in 1892, were battery-powered but within as little as three months they were replaced with horse-drawn trams. In New York City some minor lines also used storage batteries. Then, comparatively recently, during the 1950s, a longer battery-operated tramway line ran from Milan to [[Bergamo]].

Conventional electric trams are operated in [[street running]] and on [[reserved track]] for most of their route. However, on one steep segment of track, they are assisted by cable tractors, which push the trams uphill and act as brakes for the downhill run.

(Grossraumtriebwagen 524) The then obsolete tram model would soon be phased out, and the entire system closed.]]\n\nThe advent of personal motor vehicles and the improvements in motorized buses caused the rapid disappearance of the tram from most western and Asian countries by the end of the 1950s (for example the first major UK city to completely abandon its trams was [[Manchester Corporation Tramways|Manchester]] by January 1949). Continuing technical and reliability improvements in buses made them a serious competitor to trams because they did not require the construction of costly infrastructure.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070702205035/http://www.lava.net/cslater/TQOrigin.pdf]</ref> However, the demise of the streetcar came when lines were torn out of the major cities by \"bus manufacturing or oil marketing companies for the specific purpose of replacing rail service with buses.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.heritagetrolley.org/articleTennyson.htm | title=Transit Ridership \u2013 Rail vs. Bus | publisher=APTA Streetcar and Heritage Trolley Site | accessdate=4 July 2015 }}</ref>\n\nIn many cases postwar buses were cited as providing a smoother ride and a faster journey than the older, prewar trams. For example, the tram network survived in Budapest but for a considerable period of time bus fares were higher to recognize the superior quality of the buses. However, many riders protested against the replacement of streetcars arguing that buses weren't as smooth or efficient and polluted the air. In the United States, there have been allegations that the [[Great American streetcar scandal]] was responsible for the replacement of trains with buses, but critics of this theory point to evidence that larger economic forces were driving conversion before General Motors' actions and outside of its reach. Certainly the oldest system of all, the [[Swansea and Mumbles Railway]] of 1807, was purchased by The South Wales Transport Company (which operated a large motor bus fleet in the area) and despite vociferous local opposition, closed down in 1960.\n\nGovernments thus put investment principally into bus networks. Indeed, infrastructure for roads and highways meant for the automobile were perceived as a mark of progress. The priority given to roads is illustrated in the proposal of French president [[Georges Pompidou]] who declared in 1971 that \"the city must adapt to the car\". Tram networks were no longer maintained or modernized, a state of affairs that served to discredit them in the eyes of the public. Old lines, considered archaic, were then gradually replaced by buses.\n\nTram networks disappeared almost completely from France, the UK, and altogether from Ireland, Denmark, Spain, as well as being completely removed from cities such as [[Trams in Sydney|Sydney]], which had one of the largest networks in the world with route length {{convert|291|mi|km|abbr=on}} and [[Trams in Brisbane|Brisbane]]. The vast majority of tram networks also disappeared in North America, but American cities [[Boston]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[San Francisco]], [[New Orleans]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Cleveland]], Canadian [[Toronto]] and [[Mexico City]] still retained trams. This situation occurred in Italy and Netherlands, too. There are preserved system in [[Milan]], [[Rome]], [[Naples]], [[Turin]], [[Ritten]] and between [[Trieste\u2013Opicina tramway|Trieste and Opicina]], and in [[Amsterdam]], [[Rotterdam]] and [[The Hague]]. On the other hand, tram systems were generally retained or modernized in most [[communism|communist]] countries, as well as Switzerland, West Germany, Austria, Belgium, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Japan etc. though cuts and closures of entire systems also happened there as the example of Hamburg shows. In France, only the networks in [[Lille]], [[Saint-\u00c9tienne]] and [[Marseille]], survive from this period, but they all suffered significant reduction from their original size. In Great Britain, only the [[Blackpool Tramway]] kept running, with an extensive system which includes some street running in Blackpool, and a long stretch of segregated track to nearby Fleetwood.\n\n==Modern development==\nWhile many networks closed down during the postwar decades, the rolling stock on remaining systems kept developing, with multi-car trains (or [[articulated vehicles|articulated trams]]) with double-end designs and automatic control systems, allowing a single driver to serve more passengers, and decreasing turnaround time. Passenger and driver comfort have improved with stuffed seats and cabin heating. Advertising on trams, including all-over striping, became common.\n\nThe resurgence in the late 20th and 21st century has seen development of new technologies such as [[low-floor tram]]s and [[regenerative braking]].\n\n==Resurgences==\n[[File:Eurotram Strasbourg Langstross tram A (2004).jpg|thumb|Tram in [[Strasbourg]], 2004]]\n[[File:GVB Combino (Amsterdam tram) on route 10.jpg|thumb|A [[Siemens]] [[Combino]] tram in [[Amsterdam]], 2004]]\n[[File:M32tram.jpg|thumb|An Italian produced [[Sirio]] tram in [[Gothenburg]], 2006]]\nThe priority given to personal vehicles and notably to the automobile led to a loss in quality of life, particularly in large cities where [[smog]], [[traffic congestion]], [[Noise pollution|sound pollution]] and [[parking]] became problematic. Acknowledging this, some authorities saw fit to redefine their transport policies. [[Rapid transit]] required a heavy investment and presented problems in terms of subterranean spaces that required constant security. For rapid transit, the investment was mainly in underground construction, which made it impossible in some cities (with underground water reserves, archaeological remains, etc.). Metro construction thus was not a universal panacea.\n\nThe advantages of the tram thus became once again visible. At the end of the 1970s, some governments studied, and then built new tram lines. The renaissance of light rail in North America began in 1978 when the Canadian city of [[Edmonton, Alberta]] adopted the German [[Siemens-Duewag U2]] system, followed three years later by [[Calgary, Alberta]] and [[San Diego, California]].\n\nBritain began replacing its run-down local railways with light rail in the 1980s, starting with the [[Tyne and Wear Metro]] in [[Tyneside]] and followed by the [[Docklands Light Railway]] in London. The trend to light rail in the United Kingdom was firmly established with the success of the [[Manchester Metrolink]] system and [[Sheffield Supertram]] in 1992, followed by [[Midland Metro]] in Birmingham in 1999, and [[Tramlink]] in London in 2000.\n\nIn France, [[Nantes]] and [[Grenoble]] lead the way in terms of the modern tram, and new systems were inaugurated in 1985 and 1988. In 1994 [[Strasbourg]] opened a system with novel British-built trams, specified by the city, with the goal of breaking with the archaic conceptual image that was held by the public.\n\nA great example of this shift in ideology is the city of [[Munich]], which began replacing its tram network with a [[rapid transit|metro]] a few years before the [[1972 Summer Olympics]]. When the metro network was finished in the 1990s the city began to tear out the tram network (which had become rather old and decrepit), but now faced opposition from many citizens who enjoyed the enhanced mobility of the mixed network\u2014the metro lines deviate from the tram lines to a significant degree. New [[rolling stock]] was purchased and the system was modernized, and a new line was proposed in 2003.\n\nThe Olympic Games of 2004 that prompted the redevelopment of trams as part of the [[Athens Mass Transit System]]. The [[Athens Tram|tramways in Athens]] are integrated with the revived [[Athens Metro]] system, as well as the buses, trolleybuses and suburban trains.\n\nIn [[Melbourne]], Australia, the already extensive tramway system continues to be extended. In 2004 the Mont Albert line was extended several kilometres to Box Hill, whilst in 2005 the Burwood East line was extended several kilometres to Vermont South. In Sydney, trams returned in the form of [[Light rail in Sydney|light rail]] with the opening of the [[Inner West Light Rail]] line in 1997, which has seen extensions and now covers {{convert|7.2|mi|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn Scotland, [[Edinburgh]] relaunched its [[Edinburgh Trams|tram network]] on 31 May 2014<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-27250311 | title=Edinburgh tram starting date revealed as 31 May | publisher=BBC | date=2 May 2014 | accessdate=4 July 2015 }}</ref> after delayed development which began in 2008.

These trams were an animal railway, usually using [[horse]]s and sometimes [[mule]]s to haul the cars, usually two as a team. Rarely, other animals were tried, including humans in emergency circumstances. It was followed in 1835 by [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], which is the oldest continuously operating street railway system in the world, according to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.<!--what line?--><ref name=\"Bellis\">{{cite web|last = Bellis|first = Mary|title =  History of Streetcars and Cable Cars|url = http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blstreetcars.htm|accessdate = 2007-01-10}}</ref>\n\nThe first tram in Continental Europe opened in France in 1839 between [[Montbrison, Loire|Montbrison]] and [[Montrond-les-Bains|Montrond]], on the streets inside the towns, and on the roadside outside town. It had permission for steam traction, but was entirely run with horse traction. In 1848, it was closed down after repeated economic failure.  The tram developed in numerous cities of Europe (some of the most extensive systems were found in Berlin, [[Budapest]], [[Birmingham Corporation Tramways|Birmingham]], [[Leningrad]], [[Lisbon]], [[London County Council Tramways|London]],  [[Manchester Corporation Tramways|Manchester]], [[Tramways in Paris#History|Paris]]).\n\nThe first tram in South America opened in 1858 in [[List of town tramway systems in Chile|Santiago, Chile]]. The first trams in Australia opened in 1860 in [[Trams in Sydney|Sydney]]. Africa's first tram service started in [[Trams in Alexandria|Alexandria]] on 8 January 1863. The first trams in Asia opened in 1869 in [[Trams in Asia|Batavia (now Jakarta), Netherlands East Indies (now Indonesia)]].\n\nProblems with horsecars included the fact that any given animal could only work so many hours on a given day, had to be housed, groomed, fed and cared for day in and day out, and produced prodigious amounts of manure, which the streetcar company was charged with storing and then disposing. Since a typical horse pulled a streetcar for about a dozen miles a day and worked for four or five hours, many systems needed ten or more horses in stable for each horsecar.\n\nHorsecars were largely replaced by electric-powered trams following the improvement of an overhead trolley system on trams for collecting electricity from [[overhead wire]]s by [[Frank J. Sprague]]. His spring-loaded [[trolley pole]] used a wheel to travel along the wire. In late 1887 and early 1888, using his trolley system, Sprague installed the first successful large electric street railway system in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. Within a year, the economy of electric power had replaced more costly horsecars in many cities. By 1889, 110 electric railways incorporating Sprague's equipment had been begun or planned on several continents.<ref name=\"siemens.com\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.siemens.com/history/en/innovations/transportation.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=5 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729124510/https://www.siemens.com/history/en/innovations/transportation.htm |archive-date=29 July 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nHorses continued to be used for light shunting well into the 20th century.

The \"van\" now lies at the Ulster Transport Museum.\n\nHorse-drawn trams still operate on the 1876-built [[Douglas Bay Horse Tramway]] in the [[Isle of Man]], and at the 1894-built [[Victor Harbor Horse Drawn Tram]], in Adelaide, South Australia. New horse-drawn systems have been established at the [[Hokkaid\u014d]] Museum in Japan and also in [[Disneyland]].\n\n==Steam==\n{{See also|Tram engine|Steam dummy}}\n[[File:Bruehl Feuriger Elias.jpg|thumb|right|A German steam tram engine from the [[Cologne Stadtbahn|Cologne-Bonn railway]], pulling a train through [[Br\u00fchl (Rhineland)|Br\u00fchl]] marketplace, around 1900]]\n\nThe first mechanical trams were powered by [[steam engine|steam]]. Generally, there were two types of steam tram. The first and most common had a small [[steam locomotive]] (called a [[tram engine]] in the UK) at the head of a line of one or more carriages, similar to a small train. Systems with such steam trams included [[Christchurch]], New Zealand; [[Trams in Adelaide|Adelaide]], [[South Australia]]; Sydney, Australia and other city systems in [[New South Wales]]; [[Munich]], Germany (from August 1883 on),<ref name=Muenchen1964>{{cite news| url = http://www.tram-muenchen.de/geschichte/chronik-vor1964.html| title = 1876 \u2013 1964 (\u00dcberblick)| archiveurl = https://archive.is/20110224053241/http://www.tram-muenchen.de/geschichte/chronik-vor1964.html| archivedate = 24 February 2011| accessdate = 2015-03-08| url-status = dead}}</ref> [[Mohamedali Tramways Company|British India (Pakistan)]] (from 1885) and the Dublin & Blessington Steam Tramway (from 1888) in Ireland. Steam tramways also were used on the suburban tramway lines around [[Milan]] and [[Padua]]; the last ''Gamba de Legn'' (\"Peg-Leg\") tramway ran on the Milan-[[Magenta]]-Castano Primo route in late 1958.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nThe other style of steam tram had the steam engine in the body of the tram, referred to as a [[tram engine]] (UK) or [[steam dummy]] (US). The most notable system to adopt such trams was in Paris. French-designed steam trams also operated in [[Rockhampton, Queensland|Rockhampton]], in the Australian state of [[Queensland]] between 1909 and 1939. [[Stockholm]], Sweden, had a steam tram line at the island of [[S\u00f6dermalm]] between 1887 and 1901.\n\nTram engines usually had modifications to make them suitable for street running in residential areas. The wheels, and other moving parts of the machinery, were usually enclosed for safety reasons and to make the engines quieter. Measures were often taken to prevent the engines from emitting visible smoke or steam. Usually the engines used [[coke (fuel)|coke]] rather than coal as fuel to avoid emitting smoke; [[Condensing steam locomotive|condensers]] or [[Superheater|superheating]] were used to avoid emitting visible steam. A major drawback of this style of tram was the limited space for the engine, so that these trams were usually underpowered. Steam tram engines faded out around 1890s to 1900s, being replaced by electric trams.\n\n==Cable-hauled==\n{{Main|Cable car (railway)}}\n[[Image:Minories stationLBR.jpg|thumb|Winding drums on the [[London and Blackwall Railway|London and Blackwall]] cable-operated railway, 1840]]\n[[File:11 Cable Car on Powell St crop, SF, CA, jjron 25.03.2012.jpg|thumb|A [[San Francisco cable car system|San Francisco cable car]]: a cable pulled system, still operating {{as of|2017|lc=y}}]]\n\nAnother motive system for trams was the cable car, which was pulled along a [[rail track|fixed track]] by a moving steel cable. The power to move the cable was normally provided at a \"powerhouse\" site a distance away from the actual vehicle.\n\nThe [[London and Blackwall Railway]], which opened for passengers in east London, England, in 1840 used such a system.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Robertson|first=Andrew|date=March 1848|title=Blackwall Railway Machinery|journal=The Civil engineer and architect's journal|publisher=Wiley & Putnam|location=New York|volume=11}}</ref>\n\nThe first practical cable car line was tested in [[San Francisco cable car system|San Francisco]], in 1873. Part of its success is attributed to the development of an effective and reliable [[cable grip]] mechanism, to grab and release the moving cable without damage. The second city to operate cable trams was [[Dunedin cable tramway system|Dunedin]] in New Zealand, from 1881 to 1957.\n\nThe most extensive cable system in the US was built in [[Chicago City Railway|Chicago]] between 1882 and 1906.<ref>{{cite book|last=Borzo|first=Greg|title=Chicago Cable Cars|year=2012|publisher=The History Press|lccn=|isbn=978-1-60949-327-1|pages=15\u201321}}</ref>{{when|date=March 2013}} New York City developed at least seven cable car lines.{{when|date=March 2013}} Los Angeles also had several cable car lines, including the Second Street Cable Railroad, which operated from 1885 to 1889, and the Temple Street Cable Railway, which operated from 1886 to 1898.\n\n[[File:Melbourne cable tram 1905.jpg|thumb|Cable tram dummy and trailer on the [[Melbourne tram route 96|St. Kilda Line]] in Melbourne in 1905.]]\nFrom 1885 to 1940, the city of [[Melbourne cable tramway system|Melbourne]], Victoria, Australia operated one of the largest cable systems in the world, at its peak running 592 trams on {{convert|75|km|mi}} of track, though during its heyday, [[Trams in Sydney|Sydney's network was larger]],<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FowEWGlvOKk From ABC-TV's 'Can you help?'. Sydney, the largest city in Australia, once had the largest tram system in Australia, the second largest in the Commonwealth (after London), and one of the largest in the world. In the early 1960s the entire network was dismantled.]</ref> with about 1,600 cars in service at any one time at its peak during the 1930s (cf. about 500 trams in Melbourne today). There were also two isolated cable lines in Sydney, the North Sydney line from 1886 to 1900,<ref>[[Trams in Sydney]]</ref> and the King Street line from 1892 to 1905. Sydney's tram network ceased to serve the city population by the 1960s, with all tracks being removed, in lieu of a bus service. Melbourne's tram network, however, continues to run to this day.\n\nIn [[Dresden]], Germany, in 1901 an elevated [[suspension railway|suspended]] cable car following the ''Eugen Langen one-railed floating tram system'' started operating. Cable cars operated on [[Highgate Hill]] in North London and [[Kennington]] to [[Brixton]] Hill In South London.{{when|date=March 2013}} They also worked around \"Upper Douglas\" in the [[Isle of Man]] from 1897 to 1929 (cable car 72/73 is the sole survivor of the fleet).\n\nCable cars suffered from high [[infrastructure]] costs, since an expensive system of [[Wire rope|cables]], [[pulley]]s, [[stationary engine]]s and lengthy underground vault structures beneath the rails had to be provided. They also required physical strength and skill to operate, and alert operators to avoid obstructions and other cable cars. The cable had to be disconnected (\"dropped\") at designated locations to allow the cars to coast by inertia, for example when crossing another cable line. The cable would then have to be \"picked up\" to resume progress, the whole operation requiring precise timing to avoid damage to the cable and the grip mechanism. Breaks and frays in the cable, which occurred frequently, required the complete cessation of services over a cable route while the cable was repaired. Due to overall wear, the entire length of cable (typically several kilometres) would have to be replaced on a regular schedule. After the development of reliable electrically powered trams, the costly high-maintenance cable car systems were rapidly replaced in most locations.\n\nCable cars remained especially effective in hilly cities, since their nondriven wheels would not [[rail adhesion|lose traction]] as they climbed or descended a steep hill. The moving cable would physically pull the car up the hill at a steady pace, unlike a low-powered steam or horse-drawn car. Cable cars do have wheel brakes and [[track brake]]s, but the cable also helps restrain the car to going downhill at a constant speed. Performance in steep terrain partially explains the survival of cable cars in San Francisco.\n\nThe [[San Francisco cable car system|San Francisco cable cars]], though significantly reduced in number, continue to perform a regular transportation function, in addition to being a well-known [[tourist attraction]]. A single cable line also survives in [[Wellington]], New Zealand (rebuilt in 1979 as a [[funicular]] but still called the \"[[Wellington Cable Car]]\"). Another system, actually two separate cable lines with a shared power station in the middle, operates from the Welsh town of [[Llandudno]] up to the top of the [[Great Orme]] hill in [[North Wales]], UK.\n\n==Gas==\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries a number of systems in various parts of the world employed trams powered by gas, [[naphtha]] gas or [[coal gas]] in particular. Gas trams are known to have operated between [[Alphington, Victoria|Alphington]] and [[Clifton Hill, Victoria|Clifton Hill]] in the northern suburbs of [[Melbourne]], Australia (1886\u20131888); in Berlin and [[Dresden]], Germany; in [[Estonia]] (1920s\u20131930); between [[Jelenia G\u00f3ra]], [[Jelenia G\u00f3ra|Cieplice]], and [[Sobiesz\u00f3w]] in Poland (from 1897); and in the UK at [[Lytham St Annes]], [[Neath]] (1896\u20131920), and [[Trafford Park]], Manchester (1897\u20131908).\n\nOn 29 December 1886 the Melbourne newspaper ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]'' reprinted a report from the [[San Francisco Bulletin]] that Mr Noble had demonstrated a new 'motor car' for tramways 'with success'. The tramcar 'exactly similar in size, shape, and capacity to a cable grip car' had the 'motive power' of gas 'with which the reservoir is to be charged once a day at power stations by means of a rubber hose'. The car also carried an electricity generator for 'lighting up the tram and also for driving the engine on steep grades and effecting a start'.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article11584473 |title=WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 29, 1886. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=29 December 1886 |accessdate=10 March 2013 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nComparatively little has been published about gas trams.

It initially drew current from the rails, with overhead wire being installed in 1883.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=wN4DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA750&dq=Popular+Science+1930+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&hl=en&ei=fxBvTp7pAoyhtwfhqq33CQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CEQQ6AEwBzgU#v=onepage&q&f=true \"This is how some of the world's familiar...\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101185206/https://books.google.com/books?id=wN4DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA750&dq=Popular+Science+1930+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&hl=en&ei=fxBvTp7pAoyhtwfhqq33CQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CEQQ6AEwBzgU |date=1 January 2016 }} ''Popular Mechanics'', May 1929, pg. 750. via Google Books.</ref>\n\nIn Britain, Volk's electric railway was opened in 1883 in Brighton (see [[Volk's Electric Railway]]). This two kilometer line, re-gauged to {{convert|2|ft|9|in|mm}} in 1884, remains in service to this day, and is the oldest operating electric tramway in the world. Also in 1883, [[M\u00f6dling and Hinterbr\u00fchl Tram]] was opened near [[Vienna]] in Austria. It was the first tram in the world in regular service that was run with electricity served by an overhead line with pantograph current collectors. The [[Blackpool Tramway]], was opened in Blackpool, UK on 29 September 1885 using conduit collection along Blackpool Promenade. This system is still in operation in a modernised form.\n\nEarliest tram system in Canada was by [[John Joseph Wright]], brother of the famous mining entrepreneur [[Whitaker Wright]], in [[Toronto]] in 1883. In the US, multiple functioning experimental [[Tram#Electric (trolley cars)|electric trams]] were exhibited at the 1884 [[World Cotton Centennial]] World's Fair in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], but they were not deemed good enough to replace the [[Emile Lamm|Lamm]] fireless engines then propelling the [[St. Charles Avenue Streetcar]] in that city. The first commercial installation of an electric streetcar in the United States was built in 1884 in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] and operated for a period of one year by the East Cleveland Street Railway Company.<ref>{{cite web|last=American Public Transportation Association |title=Milestones in U.S. Public Transportation History |url=http://apta.com/research/stats/history/mileston.cfm |accessdate=2013-03-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303212350/http://apta.com/research/stats/history/mileston.cfm |archivedate=3 March 2009 }}</ref> Trams were operated in  [[Richmond, Virginia]], in 1888, on the [[Richmond Union Passenger Railway]] built by [[Frank J. Sprague]]. Sprague later developed [[multiple unit]] control, first demonstrated in Chicago in 1897, allowing multiple cars to be coupled together and operated by a single motorman. This gave birth to the modern subway train. Following the improvement of an overhead trolley system on streetcars for collecting electricity from [[overhead wire]]s by [[Frank J. Sprague]], electric tram systems were rapidly adopted across the world.\n\nEarlier installations proved difficult or unreliable. Siemens' line, for example, provided power through a live rail and a return rail, like a [[model train]], limiting the [[voltage]] that could be used, and providing electric shocks to people and animals crossing the tracks.<ref>{{cite web|last = Wood|first = E.

By the 1970s, the only tramway system remaining in Australia was the Melbourne tram system other than a few single lines remaining elsewhere: the [[Glenelg Tram]], connecting Adelaide to the beachside suburb of [[Glenelg, South Australia|Glenelg]], and tourist trams in the Victorian [[Goldfields region of Victoria|Goldfields]] cities of Bendigo and Ballarat. In recent years the Melbourne system, generally recognised as one of the largest in the world, has been considerably modernised and expanded. The Adelaide line has also been extended to the Entertainment Centre, and there are plans to expand further.\n\nIn Japan, the Kyoto Electric railroad was the first tram system, starting operation in 1895.<ref>[http://www.city.kyoto.jp/koho/eng/historical/first/04.html Kyoto Tram from Kyoto City Web].

Retrieved 12 February 2009.</ref>  By the 1960s the tram had generally died out in Japan.\n\nTwo rare but significant alternatives were [[conduit current collection]], which was widely used in London, Washington, D.C. and New York City, and the [[Stud contact system|surface contact collection]] method, used in [[Wolverhampton]] (the Lorain system), [[Torquay Tramways|Torquay]] and [[Hastings]] in the UK (the Dolter stud system), and currently in [[Tramway de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]], France (the [[ground-level power supply]] system).\n\nThe convenience and economy of electricity resulted in its rapid adoption once the technical problems of production and transmission of electricity were solved. Electric trams largely replaced animal power and other forms of motive power including cable and steam, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nThere is one particular hazard associated with trams powered from a trolley off an overhead line. Since the tram relies on contact with the rails for the current return path, a problem arises if the tram is derailed or (more usually) if it halts on a section of track that has been particularly heavily sanded by a previous tram, and the tram loses electrical contact with the rails. In this event, the underframe of the tram, by virtue of a circuit path through ancillary loads (such as saloon lighting), is live at the full supply voltage, typically 600 volts. In British terminology such a tram was said to be \u2018grounded\u2019\u2014not to be confused with the US English use of the term, which means the exact opposite. Any person stepping off the tram completed the earth return circuit and could receive a nasty electric shock. In such an event the driver was required to jump off the tram (avoiding simultaneous contact with the tram and the ground) and pull down the trolley before allowing passengers off the tram. Unless derailed, the tram could usually be recovered by running water down the running rails from a point higher than the tram. The water providing a conducting bridge between the tram and the rails.\n\nIn the 2000s, two companies introduced catenary-free designs. Alstom's Citadis line uses a third rail, and Bombardier's PRIMOVE LRV is charged by contactless induction plates embedded in the trackway.<ref>[http://www.thetransportpolitic.wordpress.com/2009/01/22/bombardier-presents-new-catenary-free-streetcar/ Wordpress.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129082418/http://thetransportpolitic.wordpress.com/2009/01/22/bombardier-presents-new-catenary-free-streetcar/ |date=29 January 2009 }}, \"The transport politic\"</ref>\n\n===Battery===\n\nAs early as 1834, [[Thomas Davenport (inventor)|Thomas Davenport]], a Vermont blacksmith, had invented a battery-powered electric motor which he later patented.

(Grossraumtriebwagen 524) The then obsolete tram model would soon be phased out, and the entire system closed.]]\n\nThe advent of personal motor vehicles and the improvements in motorized buses caused the rapid disappearance of the tram from most western and Asian countries by the end of the 1950s (for example the first major UK city to completely abandon its trams was [[Manchester Corporation Tramways|Manchester]] by January 1949). Continuing technical and reliability improvements in buses made them a serious competitor to trams because they did not require the construction of costly infrastructure.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070702205035/http://www.lava.net/cslater/TQOrigin.pdf]</ref> However, the demise of the streetcar came when lines were torn out of the major cities by \"bus manufacturing or oil marketing companies for the specific purpose of replacing rail service with buses.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.heritagetrolley.org/articleTennyson.htm | title=Transit Ridership \u2013 Rail vs. Bus | publisher=APTA Streetcar and Heritage Trolley Site | accessdate=4 July 2015 }}</ref>\n\nIn many cases postwar buses were cited as providing a smoother ride and a faster journey than the older, prewar trams. For example, the tram network survived in Budapest but for a considerable period of time bus fares were higher to recognize the superior quality of the buses. However, many riders protested against the replacement of streetcars arguing that buses weren't as smooth or efficient and polluted the air. In the United States, there have been allegations that the [[Great American streetcar scandal]] was responsible for the replacement of trains with buses, but critics of this theory point to evidence that larger economic forces were driving conversion before General Motors' actions and outside of its reach. Certainly the oldest system of all, the [[Swansea and Mumbles Railway]] of 1807, was purchased by The South Wales Transport Company (which operated a large motor bus fleet in the area) and despite vociferous local opposition, closed down in 1960.\n\nGovernments thus put investment principally into bus networks. Indeed, infrastructure for roads and highways meant for the automobile were perceived as a mark of progress. The priority given to roads is illustrated in the proposal of French president [[Georges Pompidou]] who declared in 1971 that \"the city must adapt to the car\". Tram networks were no longer maintained or modernized, a state of affairs that served to discredit them in the eyes of the public. Old lines, considered archaic, were then gradually replaced by buses.\n\nTram networks disappeared almost completely from France, the UK, and altogether from Ireland, Denmark, Spain, as well as being completely removed from cities such as [[Trams in Sydney|Sydney]], which had one of the largest networks in the world with route length {{convert|291|mi|km|abbr=on}} and [[Trams in Brisbane|Brisbane]]. The vast majority of tram networks also disappeared in North America, but American cities [[Boston]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[San Francisco]], [[New Orleans]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Cleveland]], Canadian [[Toronto]] and [[Mexico City]] still retained trams. This situation occurred in Italy and Netherlands, too. There are preserved system in [[Milan]], [[Rome]], [[Naples]], [[Turin]], [[Ritten]] and between [[Trieste\u2013Opicina tramway|Trieste and Opicina]], and in [[Amsterdam]], [[Rotterdam]] and [[The Hague]]. On the other hand, tram systems were generally retained or modernized in most [[communism|communist]] countries, as well as Switzerland, West Germany, Austria, Belgium, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Japan etc. though cuts and closures of entire systems also happened there as the example of Hamburg shows. In France, only the networks in [[Lille]], [[Saint-\u00c9tienne]] and [[Marseille]], survive from this period, but they all suffered significant reduction from their original size. In Great Britain, only the [[Blackpool Tramway]] kept running, with an extensive system which includes some street running in Blackpool, and a long stretch of segregated track to nearby Fleetwood.\n\n==Modern development==\nWhile many networks closed down during the postwar decades, the rolling stock on remaining systems kept developing, with multi-car trains (or [[articulated vehicles|articulated trams]]) with double-end designs and automatic control systems, allowing a single driver to serve more passengers, and decreasing turnaround time. Passenger and driver comfort have improved with stuffed seats and cabin heating. Advertising on trams, including all-over striping, became common.\n\nThe resurgence in the late 20th and 21st century has seen development of new technologies such as [[low-floor tram]]s and [[regenerative braking]].\n\n==Resurgences==\n[[File:Eurotram Strasbourg Langstross tram A (2004).jpg|thumb|Tram in [[Strasbourg]], 2004]]\n[[File:GVB Combino (Amsterdam tram) on route 10.jpg|thumb|A [[Siemens]] [[Combino]] tram in [[Amsterdam]], 2004]]\n[[File:M32tram.jpg|thumb|An Italian produced [[Sirio]] tram in [[Gothenburg]], 2006]]\nThe priority given to personal vehicles and notably to the automobile led to a loss in quality of life, particularly in large cities where [[smog]], [[traffic congestion]], [[Noise pollution|sound pollution]] and [[parking]] became problematic. Acknowledging this, some authorities saw fit to redefine their transport policies. [[Rapid transit]] required a heavy investment and presented problems in terms of subterranean spaces that required constant security. For rapid transit, the investment was mainly in underground construction, which made it impossible in some cities (with underground water reserves, archaeological remains, etc.). Metro construction thus was not a universal panacea.\n\nThe advantages of the tram thus became once again visible. At the end of the 1970s, some governments studied, and then built new tram lines. The renaissance of light rail in North America began in 1978 when the Canadian city of [[Edmonton, Alberta]] adopted the German [[Siemens-Duewag U2]] system, followed three years later by [[Calgary, Alberta]] and [[San Diego, California]].\n\nBritain began replacing its run-down local railways with light rail in the 1980s, starting with the [[Tyne and Wear Metro]] in [[Tyneside]] and followed by the [[Docklands Light Railway]] in London. The trend to light rail in the United Kingdom was firmly established with the success of the [[Manchester Metrolink]] system and [[Sheffield Supertram]] in 1992, followed by [[Midland Metro]] in Birmingham in 1999, and [[Tramlink]] in London in 2000.\n\nIn France, [[Nantes]] and [[Grenoble]] lead the way in terms of the modern tram, and new systems were inaugurated in 1985 and 1988. In 1994 [[Strasbourg]] opened a system with novel British-built trams, specified by the city, with the goal of breaking with the archaic conceptual image that was held by the public.\n\nA great example of this shift in ideology is the city of [[Munich]], which began replacing its tram network with a [[rapid transit|metro]] a few years before the [[1972 Summer Olympics]]. When the metro network was finished in the 1990s the city began to tear out the tram network (which had become rather old and decrepit), but now faced opposition from many citizens who enjoyed the enhanced mobility of the mixed network\u2014the metro lines deviate from the tram lines to a significant degree.

As one of Switzerland\u2019s longest-established industrial companies, Von Roll focuses today on products and systems for electrical applications such as power generation, transmission and storage as well as e-mobility and industrial applications.\n\n== History ==\nVon Roll has its roots in the ''Eisenwerke der Handelsgesellschaft der Gebr\u00fcder D\u00fcrholz & Co.'' (Ironworks of the commercial firm of the Brothers Durholz & Co.) which was established in 1803. This firm was then taken over in 1810 by Von Roll & Cie, newly formed by Ludwig Freiherr von Roll (1771\u20131839) and Jakob von Glutz. In May 1823, Ludwig von Roll founded the ''Gesellschaft der Ludwig von Roll'schen Eisenwerke'' which benefited from industrialization and railroad construction that demanded a lot of iron.<ref name=\"history\">Von Roll Holding AG - [http://www.vonroll.com/about-us/company-profile/historical-milestones This History of Von Roll]</ref>\n\nFollowing this, the business developed into one of the most important industrial groups in Switzerland with more than 10,000 employees in the 1970s. Like other Swiss companies, Von Roll suffered during the oil crisis of 1973. The company underwent financial restructuring after financial restructuring, seemingly without end. As recently as 2003, Von Roll had to fight for its survival. At the end of 2002, following the accumulated losses of previous years, Von Roll\u2019s equity capital had shrunk to 10.3 million. In 2004 the company initiated a new strategy to focus on the insulation business, beginning its turnaround.\n\nThe main shareholder is in early 2019 [[August von Finck Jr.]] family with above 65% of the quotes.

A total of over 100 were installed; as of 2008 only ten remained operational.\nOn December 30, 1954, [[Luftseilbahn Adliswil-Felsenegg|Felseneggbahn]] was opened. It was built by Von Roll in seven months for one million Swiss francs.

As one of Switzerland\u2019s longest-established industrial companies, Von Roll focuses today on products and systems for electrical applications such as power generation, transmission and storage as well as e-mobility and industrial applications.\n\n== History ==\nVon Roll has its roots in the ''Eisenwerke der Handelsgesellschaft der Gebr\u00fcder D\u00fcrholz & Co.'' (Ironworks of the commercial firm of the Brothers Durholz & Co.) which was established in 1803. This firm was then taken over in 1810 by Von Roll & Cie, newly formed by Ludwig Freiherr von Roll (1771\u20131839) and Jakob von Glutz. In May 1823, Ludwig von Roll founded the ''Gesellschaft der Ludwig von Roll'schen Eisenwerke'' which benefited from industrialization and railroad construction that demanded a lot of iron.<ref name=\"history\">Von Roll Holding AG - [http://www.vonroll.com/about-us/company-profile/historical-milestones This History of Von Roll]</ref>\n\nFollowing this, the business developed into one of the most important industrial groups in Switzerland with more than 10,000 employees in the 1970s. Like other Swiss companies, Von Roll suffered during the oil crisis of 1973. The company underwent financial restructuring after financial restructuring, seemingly without end. As recently as 2003, Von Roll had to fight for its survival. At the end of 2002, following the accumulated losses of previous years, Von Roll\u2019s equity capital had shrunk to 10.3 million. In 2004 the company initiated a new strategy to focus on the insulation business, beginning its turnaround.\n\nThe main shareholder is in early 2019 [[August von Finck Jr.]] family with above 65% of the quotes.  After the conversion of some convertible bonds in December 2018 the composition of shareholders became unclear.<ref>https://www.vonrollgroup.com/en/corporate-governance/corporate-governance1/group-structure-and-shareholders/</ref><ref>https://www.finanzen.ch/obligationen/roll_holding-_vonsf-wdl-anl_201414-20-obligation-2020-ch0245239287</ref><ref>https://www.finanzen.ch/obligationen/roll_holding-_vonsf-wdl-anl_201414-20-obligation-2020-ch0245239287</ref><ref>https://www.onvista.de/news/dgap-adhoc-von-roll-holding-ag-staerkung-der-kapitalstruktur-schafft-grundlagen-fuer-weiteres-wachstum-deutsch-162414507</ref> In 2019 the company is involved in law case for some salaries paid in \u20ac.<ref>https://www.rjb.ch/rjb/Actualite/Region/20190115-Payer-ses-employes-frontaliers-en-euros-est-illegal.html</ref>\n\n== Von Roll Seilbahnen AG ==\nVon Roll Seilbahnen AG was the [[aerial tramway]] and cableway division that was sold to [[Austria]]n manufacturer [[Doppelmayr Garaventa Group|Doppelmayr]] in 1996.\n\n===Products===\nPerhaps Von Roll's best-known product was the '''type 101 sky ride''' or simply \"VR101\" that operated in many amusement parks. A total of over 100 were installed; as of 2008 only ten remained operational.\nOn December 30, 1954, [[Luftseilbahn Adliswil-Felsenegg|Felseneggbahn]] was opened. It was built by Von Roll in seven months for one million Swiss francs.

{"title_page": "Aulus Didius Gallus", "text_new": "'''Aulus Didius Gallus''' was a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] general and politician of the 1st century AD. He was governor of [[Roman Britain|Britain]] between 52 and 57&nbsp;[[AD]].\n\n==Career==\nThe career of Aulus Didius Gallus up to 51 can be partly reconstructed from an inscription from [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] ({{CIL|3|7247}} + {{CIL|3|12278}}). He was [[quaestor]] under [[Tiberius]], probably in&nbsp;19. He served as a [[legatus|legate]] of the [[proconsul]] of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]], as [[prefect]] of cavalry, and as proconsul of [[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicily]], although the dates of these appointments are unknown. He was ''[[curator aquarum]]'' (superintendent of [[Aqueduct (Roman)|aqueducts]]) from 38 to&nbsp;49, [[consul]] in&nbsp;39, and a member of the ''XVviri''. He received [[Roman triumph|triumphal]] regalia as an imperial legate under [[Claudius]], probably in [[Bosporan Kingdom|Bosporus]]: [[Tacitus]] records that he commanded forces there that were withdrawn in&nbsp;49. After this he appears to have taken up another proconsular appointment, possibly in Asia or [[Africa Province|Africa]].\n\nHis later career is described by Tacitus. In 52 he was made governor of [[Roman Britain|Britain]], following the death in office of [[Ostorius Scapula]], at a time when the situation was deteriorating as a result of a string of rebellions. The south-east was securely held, but despite the defeat of [[Caratacus]] the previous year, the tribes of what is now [[Wales]], particularly the [[Silures]], continued to hold out. [[Venutius]]' first insurrection against Queen [[Cartimandua]] of the [[Brigantes]] occurred during Didius' rule and he despatched troops under [[Caesius Nasica]] to aid her.\n\nDidius acted to quell the rebels rather than enlarge the empire during his rule, which lasted until AD&nbsp;57. Although criticised by [[Tacitus]] as being reactive and defensive, he was probably acting on instructions from Claudius who did not consider the benefits of further conquest in difficult terrain to be great enough to warrant the risk. Instead, Didius built roads and forts at the borders such as those at [[Usk]] to contain the native population. After five years in the post, covering the last two years of the reign of [[Claudius]] and the first three of [[Nero]], Didius was replaced by [[Quintus Veranius]].\n\n[[Quintilian]] tells us that, after several years of campaigning for a provincial governorship, Didius complained at the province he was offered, although whether this refers to Sicily or Britain is unknown. The orator [[Domitius Afer]] sarcastically advised him to think of his country. The next governor of Britain, [[Quintus Veranius]], says on his tombstone that he took the job \"although he did not seek it\", which has been interpreted as a barbed comment on Didius.\n\n==Eponym of Cardiff==\nThe modern city of [[Cardiff]] in [[Wales]] is often stated to be named for Didius.\n\nThe earliest [[Welsh language|Welsh]] name for the city, ''Caerdyf'' combines the elements [[Caer]] (fort) which refers to [[Cardiff Roman Fort|the Roman fort]] established around 75AD, and a second element which is less certain. The antiquarian [[William Camden]] recorded the origin of the name as \"Caer-Didi\" (Didius' Fort). This derives from local beliefs that Didius had built the fort before the arrival of [[Julius Frontinus|Frontinus]] in Britain and his construction of numerous supplementary fortifications in South Wales.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/whatsinaname/sites/videoexplorer/pages/?jumpTo=cardiff |title=What's In A Name? \u2013 Cardiff |last=Pierce |first=Gwynedd O |publisher=BBC Wales |accessdate=17 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115122320/http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/whatsinaname/sites/videoexplorer/pages/?jumpTo=cardiff |archivedate=15 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nThough most modern linguists dismiss this derivation, the Didius connection has remained popular throughout the centuries, appearing in Camden's ''Britannia'' (1586), ''[[The Beauties of England and Wales]]'' (1815), and the writings of [[Iolo Morganwg]] and [[Taliesin Williams]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wedlake Brayley, Britton|first1=Edward, John|title=The Beauties of England and Wales.|date=1815|location=London|page=611|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=W49CAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA611&lpg=PA611&dq=caer+didi&source=bl&ots=0yQb_aW5oF&sig=ze2awa21BmzXpkw8RIvsKiK38ro&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjwzo_2wNjXAhXMJMAKHfflAIYQ6AEIaTAP#v=onepage&q=caer%20didi&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Taliesin|first1=Williams|title=Cardiff Castle; a poem.

He was ''[[curator aquarum]]'' (superintendent of [[Aqueduct (Roman)|aqueducts]]) from 38 to&nbsp;49, [[consul]] in&nbsp;39, and a member of the ''XVviri''. He received [[Roman triumph|triumphal]] regalia as an imperial legate under [[Claudius]], probably in [[Bosporan Kingdom|Bosporus]]: [[Tacitus]] records that he commanded forces there that were withdrawn in&nbsp;49. After this he appears to have taken up another proconsular appointment, possibly in Asia or [[Africa Province|Africa]].\n\nHis later career is described by Tacitus. In 52 he was made governor of [[Roman Britain|Britain]], following the death in office of [[Ostorius Scapula]], at a time when the situation was deteriorating as a result of a string of rebellions. The south-east was securely held, but despite the defeat of [[Caratacus]] the previous year, the tribes of what is now [[Wales]], particularly the [[Silures]], continued to hold out. [[Venutius]]' first insurrection against Queen [[Cartimandua]] of the [[Brigantes]] occurred during Didius' rule and he despatched troops under [[Caesius Nasica]] to aid her.\n\nDidius acted to quell the rebels rather than enlarge the empire during his rule, which lasted until AD&nbsp;57. Although criticised by [[Tacitus]] as being reactive and defensive, he was probably acting on instructions from Claudius who did not consider the benefits of further conquest in difficult terrain to be great enough to warrant the risk. Instead, Didius built roads and forts at the borders such as those at [[Usk]] to contain the native population. After five years in the post, covering the last two years of the reign of [[Claudius]] and the first three of [[Nero]], Didius was replaced by [[Quintus Veranius]].\n\n[[Quintilian]] tells us that, after several years of campaigning for a provincial governorship, Didius complained at the province he was offered, although whether this refers to Sicily or Britain is unknown. The orator [[Domitius Afer]] sarcastically advised him to think of his country. The next governor of Britain, [[Quintus Veranius]], says on his tombstone that he took the job \"although he did not seek it\", which has been interpreted as a barbed comment on Didius.\n\n==Eponym of Cardiff==\nThe modern city of [[Cardiff]] in [[Wales]] is often stated to be named for Didius.\n\nThe earliest [[Welsh language|Welsh]] name for the city, ''Caerdyf'' combines the elements [[Caer]] (fort) which refers to [[Cardiff Roman Fort|the Roman fort]] established around 75AD, and a second element which is less certain. The antiquarian [[William Camden]] recorded the origin of the name as \"Caer-Didi\" (Didius' Fort). This derives from local beliefs that Didius had built the fort before the arrival of [[Julius Frontinus|Frontinus]] in Britain and his construction of numerous supplementary fortifications in South Wales.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/whatsinaname/sites/videoexplorer/pages/?jumpTo=cardiff |title=What's In A Name? \u2013 Cardiff |last=Pierce |first=Gwynedd O |publisher=BBC Wales |accessdate=17 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115122320/http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/whatsinaname/sites/videoexplorer/pages/?jumpTo=cardiff |archivedate=15 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nThough most modern linguists dismiss this derivation, the Didius connection has remained popular throughout the centuries, appearing in Camden's ''Britannia'' (1586), ''[[The Beauties of England and Wales]]'' (1815), and the writings of [[Iolo Morgannwg]] and [[Taliesin Williams]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wedlake Brayley, Britton|first1=Edward, John|title=The Beauties of England and Wales.|date=1815|location=London|page=611|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=W49CAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA611&lpg=PA611&dq=caer+didi&source=bl&ots=0yQb_aW5oF&sig=ze2awa21BmzXpkw8RIvsKiK38ro&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjwzo_2wNjXAhXMJMAKHfflAIYQ6AEIaTAP#v=onepage&q=caer%20didi&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Taliesin|first1=Williams|title=Cardiff Castle; a poem.
