Its also a skill in planning of creating visual content to transit information, thought or feeling so that it is satisfactorily received. Graphic Design is the art or profession of using design elements (such as typography and images) to convey information or create an effect[Merriam-webester 1828<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/graphic+design|title=Definition of GRAPHIC DESIGN|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> . The field is considered a subset of [[visual communication]] and [[communication design]], but sometimes the term \"graphic [[design]]\" is used synonymously. Graphic designers create and combine symbols, images and text to form visual representations of ideas and messages. They use [[typography]], [[visual arts]], and [[page layout]] techniques to create [[Composition (visual arts)|visual compositions]]. Common applications of graphic design include [[corporate design]] (logos and branding), editorial design (magazines, newspapers and books), [[wayfinding|wayfinding or environmental design]], [[advertising]], [[web design]], [[communication design]], product [[Packaging and labeling|packaging]], and [[signage]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of graphic design}}\nThe term graphic design was coined by [[William Addison Dwiggins]] in 1922.<ref>Drucker, Johanna and McVarish, Emily, 'Graphic Design History: A critical Guide'. [[Pearson Education]], 2009</ref> However, the origins of graphic design can be traced from the origins of human existence, from the caves of [[Lascaux]], to Rome's [[Trajan's Column]] to the [[illuminated manuscript]]s of the Middle Ages, to the neon lights of [[Ginza]], [[Tokyo]]. In \"Babylon, artisans pressed cuneiform inscriptions into clay bricks or tablets which were used for construction. The bricks gave information such as the name of the reigning monarch, the builder, or some other dignitary\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = Advertising In America|last = Ulanoff|first = Stanley M.|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref> This was the first known road sign announcing the name of the governor of a state or mayor of the city. The Egyptians developed communication by hieroglyphics that used picture symbols dating as far back as 136 B.C. found on the [[Rosetta Stone]]. \"The Rosetta stone, found by one of Napoleon's engineers was an advertisement for the Egyptian ruler, Ptolemy as the \"true Son of the Sun, the Father of the Moon, and the Keeper of the Happiness of Men\"\" <ref name=\":0\"/> The Egyptians also invented [[papyrus]], paper made from reeds found along the [[Nile]], on which they transcribed advertisements more common among their people at the time. During the \"[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]\", from 500 <small>AD</small> to 1450 <small>AD</small>, monks created elaborate, illustrated manuscripts.\n\nIn both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion of [[visual communication]] in the 20th and 21st centuries, the distinction between [[advertising]], art, graphic design and [[fine art]] has disappeared. They share many elements, theories, principles, practices, [[language]]s and sometimes the same benefactor or client. In advertising, the ultimate objective is the sale of goods and services. In graphic design, \"the essence is to give order to information, form to ideas, expression, and feeling to artifacts that document human experience.\"<ref>Meggs, Philip B., 'A history of graphic design'. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1983</ref>\n\nGraphic design in the United States began with [[Benjamin Franklin]] who used his newspaper ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette|The Pennsylvania Gazette]]'', to master the art of publicity to promote his own books and to influence the masses. \"Benjamin Franklin's ingenuity gained in strength as did his cunning and in 1737 he had replaced his counterpart in Pennsylvania, [[Andrew Bradford]] as postmaster and printer after a competition he instituted and won. He showed his prowess by running an ad in his ''General Magazine and the Historical Chronicle of British Plantations in America'' (the precursor to the [[The Saturday Evening Post|Saturday Evening Post]]) that stressed the benefits offered by a stove he invented, named the ''Pennsylvania Fireplace''. His invention is still sold today and is known as ''the [[Franklin stove]]''. \"<ref name=\":1\">Advertising Age. How It Was In Advertising: 1776-1976. Chicago, Illinois: Crain Books, 1976.</ref>\n\nAmerican advertising initially imitated British newspapers and magazines. Advertisements were printed in scrambled type and uneven lines that made it difficult to read. Franklin better organized this by adding 14-point type for the first line of the advertisement; although later shortened and centered it, making \"headlines\". Franklin added illustrations, something that London printers had not attempted. Franklin was the first to utilize [[logo]]s, which were early symbols that announced such services as opticians by displaying golden spectacles. Franklin taught advertisers that the use of detail was important in marketing their products. Some advertisements ran for 10-20 lines, including color, names, varieties, and sizes of the goods that were offered.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n[https://99designs.com.au/blog/design-history-movements/history-graphic-design/ \"Graphic design is so much a part of our modern world that it is hard to imagine living without it.

Graphic design has been practiced in various forms throughout history; indeed, strong examples of graphic design date back to manuscripts in ancient China, Egypt, and Greece. As printing and book production developed in the 15th century, advances in graphic design developed alongside it over subsequent centuries, with compositors or typesetters often designing pages as they set the type.]\n\n[https://www.britannica.com/art/graphic-design In the late 19th century, graphic design emerged as a distinct profession in the West, in part because of the job specialization process that occurred there, and in part because of the new technologies and commercial possibilities brought about by the Industrial Revolution. New production methods led to the separation of the design of a communication medium (e.g., a poster) from its actual production. Increasingly, over the course of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, advertising agencies, book publishers, and magazines hired art directors who organized all visual elements of the communication and brought them into a harmonious whole, creating an expression appropriate to the content. In 1922 typographer William A. Dwiggins coined the term ''graphic design'' to identify the emerging field.\"] [Encyclopedia Britannica 2020]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/graphic-design|title=Graphic design - Neoclassical graphic design|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>\n\n===The advent of printing===\n{{Main article|History of printing}}\nDuring the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618\u2013907) wood blocks were cut to print on textiles and later to reproduce Buddhist texts. A Buddhist scripture printed in 868 is the earliest known printed book. Beginning in the 11th century, longer scrolls and books were produced using [[movable type]] printing, making books widely available during the [[Song dynasty]] (960\u20131279).<ref>\" Printing\" The Silk Road Foundation.

These documents announced a business and its location. English painter [[William Hogarth]] used his skill in engraving was one of the first to design for business trade.\n\nIn Mainz Germany, in 1448, [[Johann Gutenberg]] <nowiki/>introduced movable type using a new metal alloy for use in a [[printing press]] and opened a new era of commerce. This made graphics more readily available since mass printing dropped the price of printing material significantly. Previously, most advertising was word of mouth. In France and England, for example, [[Town crier|criers]] announced products for sale just as [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] had done.\n\nThe printing press made books more widely available. [[Aldus Manutius]] developed the book structure that became the foundation of western publication design. This era of graphic design is called [[Renaissance Humanism|Humanist]] or Old Style. Additionally, [[William Caxton]], England's first printer produced religious books, but had trouble selling them. He discovered the use of leftover pages and used them to announce the books and post them on church doors. This practice was termed ''\"squis\"'' or ''\"pin up\" posters,'' in approximately 1612, becoming the first form of print advertising in Europe''.'' The term ''Siquis'' came from the [[Roman era]] when public notices were posted stating ''\"if anybody...\"'', which in Latin is ''\"si quis\"''. These printed announcements were followed by later public registers of ''wants'' called ''want ads'' and in some areas such as the first periodical in Paris advertising was termed \"advices\". The \"Advices\" were what we know today as ''want ad media'' or ''advice columns''.\n\nIn 1638 [[Harvard University]] received a printing press from England. More than 52 years passed before London bookseller [[Benjamin Harris (publisher)|Benjamin Harris]] received another printing press in Boston. Harris published a newspaper in serial form, ''[[Publick Occurrences Both Forreign and Domestick|Publick Occurrences Both Foreign and Domestick]]''. It was four pages long and suppressed by the government after its first edition.\n\nJohn Campbell is credited for the first newspaper, the ''[[The Boston News-Letter|Boston News-Letter]]'', which appeared in 1704. The paper was known during the revolution as ''\"Weeklies\"''. The name came from the 13 hours required for the ink to dry on each side of the paper. The solution was to first, print the ads and then to print the news on the other side the day before publication. The paper was four pages long having ads on at least 20%-30% of the total paper, (pages one and four) the hot news was located on the inside.<ref name=\":1\" /> The initial use of the ''Boston News-Letter'' carried Campbell's own solicitations for advertising from his readers. Campbell's first paid advertisement was in his third edition, May 7 or 8th,  1704. Two of the first ads were for stolen anvils. The third was for real estate in [[Oyster Bay (town), New York|Oyster Bay]], owned by [[William Bradford (Colonial printer)|William Bradford]], a pioneer printer in New York, and the first to sell something of value. Bradford published his first newspaper in 1725, New York's first, the ''[[New-York Gazette]]''. Bradford's son preceded him in Philadelphia publishing the ''[[Andrew Bradford|American Weekly Mercury]]'', 1719. ''The Mercury'' and William Brooker's ''Massachusetts Gazette'', first published a day earlier.\n\n===Design industry===\nIn late 19th-century Europe, especially in the United Kingdom, the first official publication of a printed design was released, marking the separation of graphic design from fine art.\n\nIn 1849, [[Henry Cole]] became one of the major forces in [[design education]] in Great Britain, informing the government of the importance of design in his ''Journal of Design and Manufactures''. He organized the [[Great Exhibition]] as a celebration of modern industrial technology and Victorian design.\n\nFrom 1891 to 1896, [[William Morris]]' Kelmscott Press published some of the most significant of the graphic design products of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], and made a lucrative business of creating and selling stylish books. Morris created a market for works of graphic design in their own right and a profession for this new type of art. The Kelmscott Press is characterized by an obsession with historical styles. This historicism was the first significant reaction to the state of nineteenth-century graphic design. Morris' work, along with the rest of the [[Private Press]] movement, directly influenced [[Art Nouveau]].<ref name=mccarthy>Fiona McCarthy, ''William Morris'', London: Faber and Faber, 1996 {{ISBN|0-571-17495-7}}</ref> \n\n===Twentieth century design===\n[[File:VC-25(040616-F-5677R-002).jpg|thumb|right|A Boeing 747 aircraft with [[livery]] designating it as [[Air Force One]].

The spread of the German [[Bauhaus]] school of design to Chicago in 1937 brought a \"mass-produced\" minimalism to America; sparking \"modern\" [[architecture]] and design. Notable names in mid-century modern design include [[Adrian Frutiger]], designer of the [[typeface]]s [[Univers]] and [[Frutiger (typeface)|Frutiger]]; [[Paul Rand]], who took the principles of the Bauhaus and applied them to popular advertising and logo design, helping to create a uniquely American approach to European minimalism while becoming one of the principal pioneers of the subset of graphic design known as [[corporate identity]]; [[Alex Steinweiss]], credited with the invention of the album cover; and [[Josef M\u00fcller-Brockmann]], who designed posters in a severe yet accessible manner typical of the 1950s and 1970s era.\n\nThe professional graphic design industry grew in parallel with [[consumerism]]. This raised concerns and criticisms, notably from within the graphic design community with the [[First Things First 1964 manifesto|First Things First manifesto]].

The 2000 manifesto was also published in [[Adbusters]], known for its strong critiques of visual culture.\n\n==Applications==\n[[File:Secretary.jpg|thumb|[[Colour]]]]\nGraphic design is applied to everything visual, from [[Traffic sign|road signs]] to technical schematics, from interoffice [[memorandum]]s to reference [[User guide|manuals]].\n\nDesign can aid in selling a [[Product (business)|product]] or [[idea]]. It is applied to products and elements of company identity such as [[logo]]s, colors, [[packaging]] and text as part of [[brand]]ing (see also [[advertising]]). Branding has become increasingly more important in the range of services offered by graphic designers. Graphic designers often form part of a branding team.\n\nGraphic design is applied in the [[entertainment]] industry in decoration, scenery and visual story telling. Other examples of design for entertainment purposes include novels, vinyl [[album cover]]s, comic books, DVD covers, [[opening credits]] and [[closing credits]] in [[filmmaking]], and programs and props on stage. This could also include artwork used for T-shirts and other items screenprinted for sale.\n\nFrom scientific journals to news reporting, the presentation of opinion and facts is often improved with graphics and thoughtful compositions of visual information - known as [[information design]]. Newspapers, magazines, blogs, television and film documentaries may use graphic design. With the advent of the web, information designers with experience in interactive tools are increasingly used to illustrate the background to news stories. Information design can include [[data visualization]], which involves using programs to interpret and form data into a visually compelling presentation, and can be tied in with [[information graphics]].\n\n==Skills==\nA graphic design project may involve the stylization and presentation of existing [[writing|text]] and either preexisting [[image]]ry or images developed by the graphic designer. Elements can be incorporated in both traditional and digital form, which involves the use of visual arts, typography, and page layout techniques. Graphic designers organize pages and optionally add graphic elements. Graphic designers can commission photographers or illustrators to create original pieces. Designers use digital tools, often referred to as [[interactive design]], or [[multimedia]] design. Designers need communication skills to convince an audience and sell their designs.\n\nThe \"process school\" is concerned with communication; it highlights the channels and media through which messages are transmitted and by which senders and receivers encode and decode these messages. The semiotic school treats a message as a construction of signs which through interaction with receivers, produces meaning; communication as an agent.\n\n[https://www.thebalancecareers.com/graphic-design-skills-list-2062400 \"Many employing graphic design skills work in a communications and marketing role.

Type glyphs (characters) are created and modified using illustration techniques. Type arrangement is the selection of typefaces, point size, tracking (the space between all characters used), kerning (the space between two specific characters) and leading (line spacing).\n\nTypography is performed by typesetters, compositors, typographers, graphic artists, art directors, and clerical workers. Until the digital age, typography was a specialized occupation. Certain fonts communicate or resemble stereotypical notions. For example, 1942 Report is a font which types text akin to a typewriter or a vintage report.<ref>Butterick, Matthew. \"Butterick's Practical Typography.\" Butterick's Practical Typography. Jones McClure, 2010-14. Web. 17 Feb. 2015.</ref>\n\n===Page layout===\n{{Main article|Page layout}}\n[[File:Golden section in book design.svg|thumb|Golden section in book design]]\nPage layout deals with the arrangement of elements (content) on a page, such as image placement, text layout and style. Page design has always been a consideration in printed material and more recently extended to displays such as web pages. Elements typically consist of [[typography|type]] (text), [[image]]s (pictures), and (with print media) occasionally place-holder graphics such as a [[dieline]] for elements that are not printed with ink such as [[Die (manufacturing)|die]]/[[laser cutting]], [[foil stamping]] or [[Embossing (paper)|blind embossing]].\n\n===Printmaking===\n{{Main article|Printmaking}}\n\nPrintmaking is the process of making artworks by printing on [[paper]] and other materials or surfaces. The process is capable of producing multiples of the same work, each called a print. Each print is an original, technically known as an impression. Prints are created from a single original surface, technically a matrix. Common types of matrices include: plates of metal, usually copper or zinc for engraving or etching; stone, used for lithography; blocks of wood for woodcuts, linoleum for linocuts and fabric plates for screen-printing. Works printed from a single plate create an edition, in modern times usually each signed and numbered to form a limited edition. Prints may be published in book form, as artist's books. A single print could be the product of one or multiple techniques.[[Image:Pencils hb.jpg|thumb|The [[pencil]] is one of the most basic graphic design tools.]]\n\nAside from technology, graphic design requires [[judgment]] and [[creativity]]. Critical, observational, quantitative and analytic thinking are required for design layouts and [[artistic rendering|rendering]]. If the executor is merely following a solution (e.g. sketch, script or instructions) provided by another designer (such as an [[art director]]), then the executor is not usually considered the designer.\n\n=== Strategy ===\n[[Strategy]] is becoming more and more essential to effective graphic design. The main distinction between graphic design and [[art]] is that graphic design solves a problem as well as being aesthetically pleasing. This balance is where strategy comes in. It is important for a graphic designer to understand their clients' needs, as well as the needs of the people who will be interacting with the design. It is the designer's job to combine business and creative objectives to elevate the design beyond purely [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] means.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.howdesign.com/how-magazine/how-march-2013/understanding-design-strategy/|title=Understanding Design Strategy: Effective Graphic Design for Clients|last=Stone|first=Terry Lee|date=2013-02-22|website=HOW Design|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref>\n\n== Tools ==\nThe method of presentation (e.g. Arrangements, style, medium) is important to the design. The development and presentation tools can change how an audience perceives a project. The image or layout is produced using [[media (arts)|traditional media]] and [[technical drawing tools|guides]], or [[digital image editing]] tools on computers. Tools in [[computer graphics]] often take on traditional names such as \"scissors\" or \"[[pen]]\". Some graphic design tools such as a [[Grid (graphic design)|grid]] are used in both traditional and digital form.\n\nIn the mid-1980s [[desktop publishing]] and [[graphic art software]] applications introduced computer image manipulation and creation capabilities that had previously been manually executed. Computers enabled designers to instantly see the effects of layout or typographic changes, and to simulate the effects of traditional media. Traditional tools such as [[pencil]]s can be useful even when computers are used for finalization; a designer or art director may sketch numerous concepts as part of the [[creative process]].<ref>Jacci Howard Bear, [http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/basic/a/thumbnails.htm?terms=squiggle desktoppub.about.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206171848/http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/basic/a/thumbnails.htm?terms=squiggle |date=2013-12-06 }} Retrieved 2008-03-19</ref> Styluses can be used with tablet computers to capture hand drawings digitally.<ref>[http://vimeo.com/6986303 Milton Glaser Draws & Lectures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321100020/http://vimeo.com/6986303 |date=2014-03-21 }}. retrieved 31-01-2011</ref>\n\n===Computers and software===\nDesigners disagree whether computers enhance the creative process.<ref>[http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1030.0.html Designtalkboard.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629214914/http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1030.0.html |date=2007-06-29 }}, topic 1030 and [http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1441.msg6356.html#msg6356 Designtalkboard.com], topic 1141. retrieved 3-18-2007</ref> Some designers argue that computers allow them to explore multiple ideas quickly and in more detail than can be achieved by hand-rendering or [[paste up|paste-up]].<ref>Jann Lawrence Pollard and Jerry James Little, ''Creative Computer Tools for Artists: Using Software to Develop Drawings and Paintings,'' November 2001 Introduction</ref> While other designers find the limitless choices from digital design can lead to paralysis or endless iterations with no clear outcome.\n\nMost designers use a hybrid process that combines traditional and computer-based technologies. First, hand-rendered [[Comprehensive layout|layouts]] are used to get approval to execute an idea, then the polished visual product is produced on a computer.\n\nGraphic designers are expected to be proficient in software programs for image-making, typography and layout. Nearly all of the popular and \"industry standard\" software programs used by graphic designers since the early 1990s are products of [[Adobe Systems]] Incorporated. [[Adobe Photoshop]] (a [[Raster scan|raster]]-based program for photo editing) and [[Adobe Illustrator]] (a vector-based program for drawing) are often used in the final stage. Designers often use pre-designed [[Raster graphics|raster images]] and [[vector graphics]] in their work from online design databases. Raster images may be edited in Adobe Photoshop, logos and illustrations in Adobe Illustrator, and the final product assembled in one of the major page layout programs, such as [[Adobe InDesign]], [[PagePlus|Serif PagePlus]] and [[QuarkXPress|QuarkXpress]]. Powerful open-source programs (which are free) are also used by both professionals and casual users for graphic design, these include [[Inkscape]] (for vector graphics), [[GIMP]] (for photo-editing and image manipulation), [[Krita]] (for painting), [[Corel Graphic Suite]] (for design) and [[Scribus]] (for page layout).\n\n==Related design fields==\n===Interface design===\n{{Main article|User interface design}}\nSince the advent of personal computers, many graphic designers have become involved in [[interface design]], in an environment commonly referred to as a [[Graphical user interface|Graphical User Interface]] (GUI). This has included [[web design]] and [[software design]], when [[end user]] [[interactivity]] is a design consideration of the layout or interface. Combining visual communication skills with an understanding of user interaction and online branding, graphic designers often work with [[software developer]]s and [[web developer]]s to create the [[look and feel]] of a web site or [[software application]]. An important aspect of interface design is [[icon design]].\n\n===User experience design===\n{{Main article|User experience design}}\nUser experience design is the study, analysis, and development of a person's interaction with a company or its products.\n\n===Experiential graphic design===\n{{Main article|Environmental Graphic Design}}\n\nExperiential graphic design is the application of communication skills to the built environment. This area of graphic design requires practitioners to understand physical installations that have to be manufactured and withstand the same environmental conditions as buildings. As such, it is a cross-disciplinary collaborative process involving designers, fabricators, city planners, architects, manufacturers and construction teams.\n\nExperiential graphic designers try to solve problems that people encounter while interacting with buildings and space. Examples of practice areas for environmental graphic designers are [[wayfinding]], [[placemaking]], branded environments, exhibitions and museum displays, public installations and digital environments.\n\n==Occupations==\n{{Main article|Graphic design occupations}}\n\nGraphic design career paths cover all parts of the [[creative industries|creative spectrum]] and often overlap. Workers perform specialized tasks, such as design services, publishing, advertising and public relations. As of 2017, median pay was $48,700 per year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm|title=Graphic Designers: Occupational Outlook Handbook: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|url-status=live|access-date=2018-06-29}}</ref> The main job titles within the industry are often country specific. They can include [[graphic designer]], art director, [[creative director]], [[animator]] and entry level [[production artist]]. Depending on the industry served, the responsibilities may have different titles such as \"[[DTP associate|DTP Associate]]\" or \"[[Graphic Artist]]\". The responsibilities may involve specialized skills such as [[illustration]], [[photography]], [[animation]] or [[interactive design]].\n\nEmployment in design of online projects was expected to increase by 35% by 2026, while employment in traditional media, such as newspaper and book design, expect to go down by 22%. Graphic designers will be expected to constantly learn new techniques, programs, and methods.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm#tab-6|title=Graphic Designers :     Occupational Outlook Handbook: :     U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-10-27|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027215647/https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm#tab-6|archivedate=2017-10-27}}</ref>\n\nGraphic designers can work within companies devoted specifically to the industry, such as design consultancies or branding agencies, others may work within publishing, marketing or other communications companies. Especially since the introduction of personal computers, many graphic designers work as in-house designers in non-design oriented organizations.  Graphic designers may also work [[Freelancer|freelance]], working on their own terms, prices, ideas, etc.\n\nA graphic designer typically reports to the [[art director]], [[creative director]] or [[senior media creative]]. As a designer becomes more senior, they spend less time designing and more time leading and directing other designers on broader creative activities, such as [[brand]] development and [[corporate identity]] development. They are often expected to interact more directly with clients, for example taking and interpreting briefs.\n\n===Crowdsourcing in graphic design===\n{{Main article|Crowdsourcing creative work}}\nJeff Howe of ''[[Wired Magazine]]'' first used the term \"[[crowdsourcing]]\" in his 2006 article, \"The Rise of Crowdsourcing.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Howe|first=Jeff|title=The Rise of Crowdsourcing|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html?pg=4&topic=crowds&topic_set=|publisher=WIRED Magazine|accessdate=24 October 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209044356/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html?pg=4&topic=crowds&topic_set=|archivedate=9 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Gilmour|first=Julia|title=The Long History of Crowdsourcing \u2013 and Why You\u2019re Just Now Hearing About It|url=http://www.crowdsource.com/blog/2013/08/the-long-history-of-crowdsourcing-and-why-youre-just-now-hearing-about-it/|publisher=Crowdsource.com|accessdate=24 October 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829172727/http://www.crowdsource.com/blog/2013/08/the-long-history-of-crowdsourcing-and-why-youre-just-now-hearing-about-it/|archivedate=29 August 2014}}</ref>  It spans such creative domains as graphic design, architecture, apparel design, writing, illustration etc. Tasks may be assigned to individuals or a group and may be categorized as convergent or divergent. An example of a divergent task is generating alternative designs for a poster. An example of a convergent task is selecting one poster design. Companies, Startups, Small businesses & Entrepreneurs have all benefitted a lot from design crowdsourcing since it helps them source great graphic designs at a fraction of the budget they used to spend before. Getting a logo design through crowdsourcing being one of the most common. Major companies who operate in the design crowdsourcing space are generally referred to as design contest sites.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Visual arts}}\n\n===Related areas===\n{{div col|colwidth=20em|content=\n* [[Concept art]]\n* [[Copywriting]]\n* [[Digital illustration]]\n* [[Illustration]]\n* [[Information technology]]\n* [[Instructional design]]\n* [[Landscape architecture]]\n* [[Marketing communications]]\n* [[Motion graphic design]]\n* [[New media]]\n* [[Technical illustration]]\n* [[Technical writing]]\n* [[User Experience Design]]\n* [[User Interface Design]]\n* [[Visual communication]]\n* [[Communication design]]\n* [[Visual culture]]\n}}\n\n===Related topics===\n{{div col|colwidth=20em|content=\n* [[Aesthetics]]\n* [[Color theory]]\n* [[Design principles and elements]]\n* [[European Design Award]]\n* [[First Things First 2000 manifesto|\"First Things First 2000\"]]\n* [[Infographic]]\n* [[:Category:Graphic design schools|List of graphic design institutions]]\n* [[List of graphic designers|List of notable graphic designers]]\n* [[Logotype]]\n* [[Material culture]]\n* [[Style guide]]\n* [[Value (colorimetry)|Value]]\n* [[Visualization (computer graphics)]]\n* [[International Typographic Style]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Fiell, Charlotte and Fiell, Peter (editors).

Graphic Design is the art or profession of using design elements (such as typography and images) to convey information or create an effect. The field is considered a subset of [[visual communication]] and [[communication design]], but sometimes the term \"graphic [[design]]\" is used synonymously. Graphic designers create and combine symbols, images and text to form visual representations of ideas and messages. They use [[typography]], [[visual arts]], and [[page layout]] techniques to create [[Composition (visual arts)|visual compositions]]. Common applications of graphic design include [[corporate design]] (logos and branding), editorial design (magazines, newspapers and books), [[wayfinding|wayfinding or environmental design]], [[advertising]], [[web design]], [[communication design]], product [[Packaging and labeling|packaging]], and [[signage]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of graphic design}}\nThe term graphic design was coined by [[William Addison Dwiggins]] in 1922.<ref>Drucker, Johanna and McVarish, Emily, 'Graphic Design History: A critical Guide'. [[Pearson Education]], 2009</ref> However, the origins of graphic design can be traced from the origins of human existence, from the caves of [[Lascaux]], to Rome's [[Trajan's Column]] to the [[illuminated manuscript]]s of the Middle Ages, to the neon lights of [[Ginza]], [[Tokyo]]. In \"Babylon, artisans pressed cuneiform inscriptions into clay bricks or tablets which were used for construction. The bricks gave information such as the name of the reigning monarch, the builder, or some other dignitary\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = Advertising In America|last = Ulanoff|first = Stanley M.|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref> This was the first known road sign announcing the name of the governor of a state or mayor of the city. The Egyptians developed communication by hieroglyphics that used picture symbols dating as far back as 136 B.C. found on the [[Rosetta Stone]]. \"The Rosetta stone, found by one of Napoleon's engineers was an advertisement for the Egyptian ruler, Ptolemy as the \"true Son of the Sun, the Father of the Moon, and the Keeper of the Happiness of Men\"\" <ref name=\":0\"/> The Egyptians also invented [[papyrus]], paper made from reeds found along the [[Nile]], on which they transcribed advertisements more common among their people at the time. During the \"[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]\", from 500 <small>AD</small> to 1450 <small>AD</small>, monks created elaborate, illustrated manuscripts.\n\nIn both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion of [[visual communication]] in the 20th and 21st centuries, the distinction between [[advertising]], art, graphic design and [[fine art]] has disappeared. They share many elements, theories, principles, practices, [[language]]s and sometimes the same benefactor or client. In advertising, the ultimate objective is the sale of goods and services. In graphic design, \"the essence is to give order to information, form to ideas, expression, and feeling to artifacts that document human experience.\"<ref>Meggs, Philip B., 'A history of graphic design'. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1983</ref>\n\nGraphic design in the United States began with [[Benjamin Franklin]] who used his newspaper ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette|The Pennsylvania Gazette]]'', to master the art of publicity to promote his own books and to influence the masses. \"Benjamin Franklin's ingenuity gained in strength as did his cunning and in 1737 he had replaced his counterpart in Pennsylvania, [[Andrew Bradford]] as postmaster and printer after a competition he instituted and won. He showed his prowess by running an ad in his ''General Magazine and the Historical Chronicle of British Plantations in America'' (the precursor to the [[The Saturday Evening Post|Saturday Evening Post]]) that stressed the benefits offered by a stove he invented, named the ''Pennsylvania Fireplace''. His invention is still sold today and is known as ''the [[Franklin stove]]''. \"<ref name=\":1\">Advertising Age. How It Was In Advertising: 1776-1976. Chicago, Illinois: Crain Books, 1976.</ref>\n\nAmerican advertising initially imitated British newspapers and magazines. Advertisements were printed in scrambled type and uneven lines that made it difficult to read. Franklin better organized this by adding 14-point type for the first line of the advertisement; although later shortened and centered it, making \"headlines\". Franklin added illustrations, something that London printers had not attempted. Franklin was the first to utilize [[logo]]s, which were early symbols that announced such services as opticians by displaying golden spectacles. Franklin taught advertisers that the use of detail was important in marketing their products. Some advertisements ran for 10-20 lines, including color, names, varieties, and sizes of the goods that were offered.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n[https://99designs.com.au/blog/design-history-movements/history-graphic-design/ \"Graphic design is so much a part of our modern world that it is hard to imagine living without it.

Graphic design has been practiced in various forms throughout history; indeed, strong examples of graphic design date back to manuscripts in ancient China, Egypt, and Greece. As printing and book production developed in the 15th century, advances in graphic design developed alongside it over subsequent centuries, with compositors or typesetters often designing pages as they set the type.]\n\n[https://www.britannica.com/art/graphic-design In the late 19th century, graphic design emerged as a distinct profession in the West, in part because of the job specialization process that occurred there, and in part because of the new technologies and commercial possibilities brought about by the Industrial Revolution. New production methods led to the separation of the design of a communication medium (e.g., a poster) from its actual production. Increasingly, over the course of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, advertising agencies, book publishers, and magazines hired art directors who organized all visual elements of the communication and brought them into a harmonious whole, creating an expression appropriate to the content. In 1922 typographer William A.

A Buddhist scripture printed in 868 is the earliest known printed book. Beginning in the 11th century, longer scrolls and books were produced using [[movable type]] printing, making books widely available during the [[Song dynasty]] (960\u20131279).<ref>\" Printing\" The Silk Road Foundation.

These documents announced a business and its location. English painter [[William Hogarth]] used his skill in engraving was one of the first to design for business trade.\n\nIn Mainz Germany, in 1448, [[Johann Gutenberg]] <nowiki/>introduced movable type using a new metal alloy for use in a [[printing press]] and opened a new era of commerce. This made graphics more readily available since mass printing dropped the price of printing material significantly. Previously, most advertising was word of mouth. In France and England, for example, [[Town crier|criers]] announced products for sale just as [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] had done.\n\nThe printing press made books more widely available. [[Aldus Manutius]] developed the book structure that became the foundation of western publication design. This era of graphic design is called [[Renaissance Humanism|Humanist]] or Old Style. Additionally, [[William Caxton]], England's first printer produced religious books, but had trouble selling them. He discovered the use of leftover pages and used them to announce the books and post them on church doors. This practice was termed ''\"squis\"'' or ''\"pin up\" posters,'' in approximately 1612, becoming the first form of print advertising in Europe''.'' The term ''Siquis'' came from the [[Roman era]] when public notices were posted stating ''\"if anybody...\"'', which in Latin is ''\"si quis\"''. These printed announcements were followed by later public registers of ''wants'' called ''want ads'' and in some areas such as the first periodical in Paris advertising was termed \"advices\". The \"Advices\" were what we know today as ''want ad media'' or ''advice columns''.\n\nIn 1638 [[Harvard University]] received a printing press from England. More than 52 years passed before London bookseller [[Benjamin Harris (publisher)|Benjamin Harris]] received another printing press in Boston. Harris published a newspaper in serial form, ''[[Publick Occurrences Both Forreign and Domestick|Publick Occurrences Both Foreign and Domestick]]''. It was four pages long and suppressed by the government after its first edition.\n\nJohn Campbell is credited for the first newspaper, the ''[[The Boston News-Letter|Boston News-Letter]]'', which appeared in 1704. The paper was known during the revolution as ''\"Weeklies\"''. The name came from the 13 hours required for the ink to dry on each side of the paper. The solution was to first, print the ads and then to print the news on the other side the day before publication. The paper was four pages long having ads on at least 20%-30% of the total paper, (pages one and four) the hot news was located on the inside.<ref name=\":1\" /> The initial use of the ''Boston News-Letter'' carried Campbell's own solicitations for advertising from his readers. Campbell's first paid advertisement was in his third edition, May 7 or 8th,  1704. Two of the first ads were for stolen anvils. The third was for real estate in [[Oyster Bay (town), New York|Oyster Bay]], owned by [[William Bradford (Colonial printer)|William Bradford]], a pioneer printer in New York, and the first to sell something of value. Bradford published his first newspaper in 1725, New York's first, the ''[[New-York Gazette]]''. Bradford's son preceded him in Philadelphia publishing the ''[[Andrew Bradford|American Weekly Mercury]]'', 1719. ''The Mercury'' and William Brooker's ''Massachusetts Gazette'', first published a day earlier.\n\n===Design industry===\nIn late 19th-century Europe, especially in the United Kingdom, the first official publication of a printed design was released, marking the separation of graphic design from fine art.\n\nIn 1849, [[Henry Cole]] became one of the major forces in [[design education]] in Great Britain, informing the government of the importance of design in his ''Journal of Design and Manufactures''. He organized the [[Great Exhibition]] as a celebration of modern industrial technology and Victorian design.\n\nFrom 1891 to 1896, [[William Morris]]' Kelmscott Press published some of the most significant of the graphic design products of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], and made a lucrative business of creating and selling stylish books. Morris created a market for works of graphic design in their own right and a profession for this new type of art. The Kelmscott Press is characterized by an obsession with historical styles. This historicism was the first significant reaction to the state of nineteenth-century graphic design. Morris' work, along with the rest of the [[Private Press]] movement, directly influenced [[Art Nouveau]].<ref name=mccarthy>Fiona McCarthy, ''William Morris'', London: Faber and Faber, 1996 {{ISBN|0-571-17495-7}}</ref> \n\n===Twentieth century design===\n[[File:VC-25(040616-F-5677R-002).jpg|thumb|right|A Boeing 747 aircraft with [[livery]] designating it as [[Air Force One]].

''Modernism in Art Design and Architecture'', New York: [[St. Martins Press]]. {{ISBN|0-312-21830-3}} (cloth) {{ISBN|0-312-21832-X}} (pbk)</ref> The post-World War II American economy revealed a greater need for graphic design, mainly in advertising and packaging. The spread of the German [[Bauhaus]] school of design to Chicago in 1937 brought a \"mass-produced\" minimalism to America; sparking \"modern\" [[architecture]] and design. Notable names in mid-century modern design include [[Adrian Frutiger]], designer of the [[typeface]]s [[Univers]] and [[Frutiger (typeface)|Frutiger]]; [[Paul Rand]], who took the principles of the Bauhaus and applied them to popular advertising and logo design, helping to create a uniquely American approach to European minimalism while becoming one of the principal pioneers of the subset of graphic design known as [[corporate identity]]; [[Alex Steinweiss]], credited with the invention of the album cover; and [[Josef M\u00fcller-Brockmann]], who designed posters in a severe yet accessible manner typical of the 1950s and 1970s era.\n\nThe professional graphic design industry grew in parallel with [[consumerism]]. This raised concerns and criticisms, notably from within the graphic design community with the [[First Things First 1964 manifesto|First Things First manifesto]]. First launched by [[Ken Garland]] in 1964, it was re-published as the [[First Things First 2000 manifesto]] in 1999 in the magazine ''[[Emigre (magazine)|Emigre]]'' 51<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emigre.com/Editorial.php?sect=1&id=14 |title=\u0e3fEmigre Essays |publisher=Emigre.com |accessdate=2012-01-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106152041/http://emigre.com/Editorial.php?sect=1&id=14 |archivedate=2012-01-06 }}</ref> stating \"We propose a reversal of priorities in favor of more useful, lasting and democratic forms of communication - a mindshift away from product marketing and toward the exploration and production of a new kind of meaning.

The 2000 manifesto was also published in [[Adbusters]], known for its strong critiques of visual culture.\n\n==Applications==\n[[File:Secretary.jpg|thumb|[[Colour]]]]\nGraphic design is applied to everything visual, from [[Traffic sign|road signs]] to technical schematics, from interoffice [[memorandum]]s to reference [[User guide|manuals]].\n\nDesign can aid in selling a [[Product (business)|product]] or [[idea]]. It is applied to products and elements of company identity such as [[logo]]s, colors, [[packaging]] and text as part of [[brand]]ing (see also [[advertising]]). Branding has become increasingly more important in the range of services offered by graphic designers. Graphic designers often form part of a branding team.\n\nGraphic design is applied in the [[entertainment]] industry in decoration, scenery and visual story telling. Other examples of design for entertainment purposes include novels, vinyl [[album cover]]s, comic books, DVD covers, [[opening credits]] and [[closing credits]] in [[filmmaking]], and programs and props on stage. This could also include artwork used for T-shirts and other items screenprinted for sale.\n\nFrom scientific journals to news reporting, the presentation of opinion and facts is often improved with graphics and thoughtful compositions of visual information - known as [[information design]]. Newspapers, magazines, blogs, television and film documentaries may use graphic design. With the advent of the web, information designers with experience in interactive tools are increasingly used to illustrate the background to news stories. Information design can include [[data visualization]], which involves using programs to interpret and form data into a visually compelling presentation, and can be tied in with [[information graphics]].\n\n==Skills==\nA graphic design project may involve the stylization and presentation of existing [[writing|text]] and either preexisting [[image]]ry or images developed by the graphic designer. Elements can be incorporated in both traditional and digital form, which involves the use of visual arts, typography, and page layout techniques. Graphic designers organize pages and optionally add graphic elements. Graphic designers can commission photographers or illustrators to create original pieces. Designers use digital tools, often referred to as [[interactive design]], or [[multimedia]] design. Designers need communication skills to convince an audience and sell their designs.\n\nThe \"process school\" is concerned with communication; it highlights the channels and media through which messages are transmitted and by which senders and receivers encode and decode these messages. The semiotic school treats a message as a construction of signs which through interaction with receivers, produces meaning; communication as an agent.\n\n[https://www.thebalancecareers.com/graphic-design-skills-list-2062400 \"Many employing graphic design skills work in a communications and marketing role. Technically, graphic design is visual communication. The American Institute of Graphic Arts today defines the field for current and aspiring graphic designers.]\n\n[https://www.thebalancecareers.com/graphic-design-skills-list-2062400 The field formally incorporates creative and function understanding of seven elements into its own form of communication: space, texture, color, line, size, form, and shape.]\n\n[https://www.thebalancecareers.com/graphic-design-skills-list-2062400 While many in graphic design do complete a college degree, it is not required. You will, however, need to demonstrate your graphic design skills beyond what is listed in your resume.\"] [the balance carrer]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebalancecareers.com/graphic-design-skills-list-2062400|title=Use These Skill Words When Applying for a Graphic Design Job|last=Careers|first=Full Bio Follow Linkedin Follow Twitter Alison Doyle is the job search expert for The Balance|last2=Search|first2=One of the Industry's Most Highly-Regarded Job|website=The Balance Careers|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05|last3=Doyle|first3=career experts Read The Balance's editorial policies Alison}}</ref>\n\n===Typography===\n{{Main article|Typography}}\n\nTypography includes type design, modifying type [[glyphs]] and arranging type. Type glyphs (characters) are created and modified using illustration techniques. Type arrangement is the selection of typefaces, point size, tracking (the space between all characters used), kerning (the space between two specific characters) and leading (line spacing).\n\nTypography is performed by typesetters, compositors, typographers, graphic artists, art directors, and clerical workers. Until the digital age, typography was a specialized occupation. Certain fonts communicate or resemble stereotypical notions. For example, 1942 Report is a font which types text akin to a typewriter or a vintage report.<ref>Butterick, Matthew. \"Butterick's Practical Typography.\" Butterick's Practical Typography. Jones McClure, 2010-14. Web. 17 Feb. 2015.</ref>\n\n===Page layout===\n{{Main article|Page layout}}\n[[File:Golden section in book design.svg|thumb|Golden section in book design]]\nPage layout deals with the arrangement of elements (content) on a page, such as image placement, text layout and style. Page design has always been a consideration in printed material and more recently extended to displays such as web pages. Elements typically consist of [[typography|type]] (text), [[image]]s (pictures), and (with print media) occasionally place-holder graphics such as a [[dieline]] for elements that are not printed with ink such as [[Die (manufacturing)|die]]/[[laser cutting]], [[foil stamping]] or [[Embossing (paper)|blind embossing]].\n\n===Printmaking===\n{{Main article|Printmaking}}\n\nPrintmaking is the process of making artworks by printing on [[paper]] and other materials or surfaces. The process is capable of producing multiples of the same work, each called a print. Each print is an original, technically known as an impression. Prints are created from a single original surface, technically a matrix. Common types of matrices include: plates of metal, usually copper or zinc for engraving or etching; stone, used for lithography; blocks of wood for woodcuts, linoleum for linocuts and fabric plates for screen-printing. Works printed from a single plate create an edition, in modern times usually each signed and numbered to form a limited edition. Prints may be published in book form, as artist's books. A single print could be the product of one or multiple techniques.[[Image:Pencils hb.jpg|thumb|The [[pencil]] is one of the most basic graphic design tools.]]\n\nAside from technology, graphic design requires [[judgment]] and [[creativity]]. Critical, observational, quantitative and analytic thinking are required for design layouts and [[artistic rendering|rendering]]. If the executor is merely following a solution (e.g. sketch, script or instructions) provided by another designer (such as an [[art director]]), then the executor is not usually considered the designer.\n\n=== Strategy ===\n[[Strategy]] is becoming more and more essential to effective graphic design. The main distinction between graphic design and [[art]] is that graphic design solves a problem as well as being aesthetically pleasing. This balance is where strategy comes in. It is important for a graphic designer to understand their clients' needs, as well as the needs of the people who will be interacting with the design. It is the designer's job to combine business and creative objectives to elevate the design beyond purely [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] means.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.howdesign.com/how-magazine/how-march-2013/understanding-design-strategy/|title=Understanding Design Strategy: Effective Graphic Design for Clients|last=Stone|first=Terry Lee|date=2013-02-22|website=HOW Design|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref>\n\n== Tools ==\nThe method of presentation (e.g. Arrangements, style, medium) is important to the design. The development and presentation tools can change how an audience perceives a project. The image or layout is produced using [[media (arts)|traditional media]] and [[technical drawing tools|guides]], or [[digital image editing]] tools on computers. Tools in [[computer graphics]] often take on traditional names such as \"scissors\" or \"[[pen]]\". Some graphic design tools such as a [[Grid (graphic design)|grid]] are used in both traditional and digital form.\n\nIn the mid-1980s [[desktop publishing]] and [[graphic art software]] applications introduced computer image manipulation and creation capabilities that had previously been manually executed. Computers enabled designers to instantly see the effects of layout or typographic changes, and to simulate the effects of traditional media. Traditional tools such as [[pencil]]s can be useful even when computers are used for finalization; a designer or art director may sketch numerous concepts as part of the [[creative process]].<ref>Jacci Howard Bear, [http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/basic/a/thumbnails.htm?terms=squiggle desktoppub.about.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206171848/http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/basic/a/thumbnails.htm?terms=squiggle |date=2013-12-06 }} Retrieved 2008-03-19</ref> Styluses can be used with tablet computers to capture hand drawings digitally.<ref>[http://vimeo.com/6986303 Milton Glaser Draws & Lectures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321100020/http://vimeo.com/6986303 |date=2014-03-21 }}. retrieved 31-01-2011</ref>\n\n===Computers and software===\nDesigners disagree whether computers enhance the creative process.<ref>[http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1030.0.html Designtalkboard.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629214914/http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1030.0.html |date=2007-06-29 }}, topic 1030 and [http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1441.msg6356.html#msg6356 Designtalkboard.com], topic 1141. retrieved 3-18-2007</ref> Some designers argue that computers allow them to explore multiple ideas quickly and in more detail than can be achieved by hand-rendering or [[paste up|paste-up]].<ref>Jann Lawrence Pollard and Jerry James Little, ''Creative Computer Tools for Artists: Using Software to Develop Drawings and Paintings,'' November 2001 Introduction</ref> While other designers find the limitless choices from digital design can lead to paralysis or endless iterations with no clear outcome.\n\nMost designers use a hybrid process that combines traditional and computer-based technologies. First, hand-rendered [[Comprehensive layout|layouts]] are used to get approval to execute an idea, then the polished visual product is produced on a computer.\n\nGraphic designers are expected to be proficient in software programs for image-making, typography and layout. Nearly all of the popular and \"industry standard\" software programs used by graphic designers since the early 1990s are products of [[Adobe Systems]] Incorporated. [[Adobe Photoshop]] (a [[Raster scan|raster]]-based program for photo editing) and [[Adobe Illustrator]] (a vector-based program for drawing) are often used in the final stage. Designers often use pre-designed [[Raster graphics|raster images]] and [[vector graphics]] in their work from online design databases. Raster images may be edited in Adobe Photoshop, logos and illustrations in Adobe Illustrator, and the final product assembled in one of the major page layout programs, such as [[Adobe InDesign]], [[PagePlus|Serif PagePlus]] and [[QuarkXPress|QuarkXpress]]. Powerful open-source programs (which are free) are also used by both professionals and casual users for graphic design, these include [[Inkscape]] (for vector graphics), [[GIMP]] (for photo-editing and image manipulation), [[Krita]] (for painting), [[Corel Graphic Suite]] (for design) and [[Scribus]] (for page layout).\n\n==Related design fields==\n===Interface design===\n{{Main article|User interface design}}\nSince the advent of personal computers, many graphic designers have become involved in [[interface design]], in an environment commonly referred to as a [[Graphical user interface|Graphical User Interface]] (GUI). This has included [[web design]] and [[software design]], when [[end user]] [[interactivity]] is a design consideration of the layout or interface. Combining visual communication skills with an understanding of user interaction and online branding, graphic designers often work with [[software developer]]s and [[web developer]]s to create the [[look and feel]] of a web site or [[software application]]. An important aspect of interface design is [[icon design]].\n\n===User experience design===\n{{Main article|User experience design}}\nUser experience design is the study, analysis, and development of a person's interaction with a company or its products.\n\n===Experiential graphic design===\n{{Main article|Environmental Graphic Design}}\n\nExperiential graphic design is the application of communication skills to the built environment. This area of graphic design requires practitioners to understand physical installations that have to be manufactured and withstand the same environmental conditions as buildings. As such, it is a cross-disciplinary collaborative process involving designers, fabricators, city planners, architects, manufacturers and construction teams.\n\nExperiential graphic designers try to solve problems that people encounter while interacting with buildings and space. Examples of practice areas for environmental graphic designers are [[wayfinding]], [[placemaking]], branded environments, exhibitions and museum displays, public installations and digital environments.\n\n==Occupations==\n{{Main article|Graphic design occupations}}\n\nGraphic design career paths cover all parts of the [[creative industries|creative spectrum]] and often overlap. Workers perform specialized tasks, such as design services, publishing, advertising and public relations. As of 2017, median pay was $48,700 per year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm|title=Graphic Designers: Occupational Outlook Handbook: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|url-status=live|access-date=2018-06-29}}</ref> The main job titles within the industry are often country specific. They can include [[graphic designer]], art director, [[creative director]], [[animator]] and entry level [[production artist]]. Depending on the industry served, the responsibilities may have different titles such as \"[[DTP associate|DTP Associate]]\" or \"[[Graphic Artist]]\". The responsibilities may involve specialized skills such as [[illustration]], [[photography]], [[animation]] or [[interactive design]].\n\nEmployment in design of online projects was expected to increase by 35% by 2026, while employment in traditional media, such as newspaper and book design, expect to go down by 22%. Graphic designers will be expected to constantly learn new techniques, programs, and methods.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm#tab-6|title=Graphic Designers :     Occupational Outlook Handbook: :     U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-10-27|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027215647/https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm#tab-6|archivedate=2017-10-27}}</ref>\n\nGraphic designers can work within companies devoted specifically to the industry, such as design consultancies or branding agencies, others may work within publishing, marketing or other communications companies. Especially since the introduction of personal computers, many graphic designers work as in-house designers in non-design oriented organizations.  Graphic designers may also work [[Freelancer|freelance]], working on their own terms, prices, ideas, etc.\n\nA graphic designer typically reports to the [[art director]], [[creative director]] or [[senior media creative]]. As a designer becomes more senior, they spend less time designing and more time leading and directing other designers on broader creative activities, such as [[brand]] development and [[corporate identity]] development. They are often expected to interact more directly with clients, for example taking and interpreting briefs.\n\n===Crowdsourcing in graphic design===\n{{Main article|Crowdsourcing creative work}}\nJeff Howe of ''[[Wired Magazine]]'' first used the term \"[[crowdsourcing]]\" in his 2006 article, \"The Rise of Crowdsourcing.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Howe|first=Jeff|title=The Rise of Crowdsourcing|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html?pg=4&topic=crowds&topic_set=|publisher=WIRED Magazine|accessdate=24 October 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209044356/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html?pg=4&topic=crowds&topic_set=|archivedate=9 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Gilmour|first=Julia|title=The Long History of Crowdsourcing \u2013 and Why You\u2019re Just Now Hearing About It|url=http://www.crowdsource.com/blog/2013/08/the-long-history-of-crowdsourcing-and-why-youre-just-now-hearing-about-it/|publisher=Crowdsource.com|accessdate=24 October 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829172727/http://www.crowdsource.com/blog/2013/08/the-long-history-of-crowdsourcing-and-why-youre-just-now-hearing-about-it/|archivedate=29 August 2014}}</ref>  It spans such creative domains as graphic design, architecture, apparel design, writing, illustration etc. Tasks may be assigned to individuals or a group and may be categorized as convergent or divergent. An example of a divergent task is generating alternative designs for a poster. An example of a convergent task is selecting one poster design. Companies, Startups, Small businesses & Entrepreneurs have all benefitted a lot from design crowdsourcing since it helps them source great graphic designs at a fraction of the budget they used to spend before. Getting a logo design through crowdsourcing being one of the most common. Major companies who operate in the design crowdsourcing space are generally referred to as design contest sites.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Visual arts}}\n\n===Related areas===\n{{div col|colwidth=20em|content=\n* [[Concept art]]\n* [[Copywriting]]\n* [[Digital illustration]]\n* [[Illustration]]\n* [[Information technology]]\n* [[Instructional design]]\n* [[Landscape architecture]]\n* [[Marketing communications]]\n* [[Motion graphic design]]\n* [[New media]]\n* [[Technical illustration]]\n* [[Technical writing]]\n* [[User Experience Design]]\n* [[User Interface Design]]\n* [[Visual communication]]\n* [[Communication design]]\n* [[Visual culture]]\n}}\n\n===Related topics===\n{{div col|colwidth=20em|content=\n* [[Aesthetics]]\n* [[Color theory]]\n* [[Design principles and elements]]\n* [[European Design Award]]\n* [[First Things First 2000 manifesto|\"First Things First 2000\"]]\n* [[Infographic]]\n* [[:Category:Graphic design schools|List of graphic design institutions]]\n* [[List of graphic designers|List of notable graphic designers]]\n* [[Logotype]]\n* [[Material culture]]\n* [[Style guide]]\n* [[Value (colorimetry)|Value]]\n* [[Visualization (computer graphics)]]\n* [[International Typographic Style]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Fiell, Charlotte and Fiell, Peter (editors).
