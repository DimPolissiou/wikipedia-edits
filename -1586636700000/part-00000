Years later in his autobiography Webb wrote that he wished he hadn't included extra vocalists because he didn't realise at the time (of the recording sessions) how vocally strong The Supremes (Jean Terrell (lead) Lynda Laurence and Mary Wilson) were. In Mary Wilson's memoir she incorrectly stated that The Blossoms were the session singers (this caused confusion for many years) until but both Jean Terrell and Lynda Laurence confirmed in a joint interview that it was definitely Clyde King and Vanetta Fields who stood beside them at the recording sessions for the [[Motown]] album.\n\nIn 1972, [[Steve Marriott]] of [[Humble Pie]] asked Fields to find two other vocalists for an album session. Fields chose King and Matthews who were both previously with Raeletts to become the Blackberries. They recorded an unreleased Blackberries album with Humble Pie as the backing band. Their single \"Twist And Shout\" was released on [[A&M Records]] in 1973. The Blackberries also provided backing vocals to the Humble Pie album ''Eat It'' (1973). When Marriott asked them to tour with Humble Pie, Matthews declined due to personal commitments. Matthews chose Billie Barnum as her replacement.

The ''isp\u00e1ns'' were appointed and dismissed by either the [[king of Hungary|monarch]]s or a high-ranking royal official responsible for the administration of a larger territorial unit within the kingdom. They fulfilled administrative, judicial and military functions in one or more counties.\n\nHeads of counties were often represented locally by their deputies, the '''vice-isp\u00e1ns'''<ref name='Rady_41'>Rady 2000, p. 41.</ref> ({{lang-hu|alisp\u00e1n}},<ref name='Nemes_21'>Nemes 1989, p. 21.</ref> {{lang-la|vicecomes}}<ref name='Nemes_21'/> and {{lang-sk|pod\u017eupan}})<ref name='Kirschbaum_315'/> from the 13th&nbsp;century.

The heads of two counties, [[Pozsony County|Pozsony]] and [[Temes County|Temes]] were even included among the \"barons of the realm\", along with the [[Palatine (Kingdom of Hungary)|palatine]] and other dignitaries. On the other hand, some of these high-ranking officials and some of the prelates were ''[[ex officio]] isp\u00e1ns'' of certain counties, including [[Esztergom County|Esztergom]], [[Feh\u00e9r County|Feh\u00e9r]] and [[Pest County|Pest]] until the 18th or 19th&nbsp;centuries.

Most of them were also heads of the basic administrative units of the kingdom, called [[County (Kingdom of Hungary)|counties]], and from the 13th&nbsp;century the latter function became dominant. The ''isp\u00e1ns'' were appointed and dismissed by either the [[king of Hungary|monarch]]s or a high-ranking royal official responsible for the administration of a larger territorial unit within the kingdom. They fulfilled administrative, judicial and military functions in one or more counties.\n\nHeads of counties were often represented locally by their deputies, the '''vice-isp\u00e1ns'''<ref name='Rady_41'>Rady 2000, p. 41.</ref> ({{lang-hu|alisp\u00e1n}},<ref name='Nemes_21'>Nemes 1989, p. 21.</ref> {{lang-la|vicecomes}}<ref name='Nemes_21'/> and {{lang-sk|pod\u017eupan}})<ref name='Kirschbaum_315'/> from the 13th&nbsp;century.

The heads of two counties, [[Pozsony County|Pozsony]] and [[Temes County|Temes]] were even included among the \"barons of the realm\", along with the [[Palatine (Kingdom of Hungary)|palatine]] and other dignitaries. On the other hand, some of these high-ranking officials and some of the prelates were ''[[ex officio]] isp\u00e1ns'' of certain counties, including [[Esztergom County|Esztergom]], [[Feh\u00e9r County|Feh\u00e9r]] and [[Pest County|Pest]] until the 18th or 19th&nbsp;centuries. Between the middle of the 15th&nbsp;century and the 18th&nbsp;century, neither was unusual an other type of [[perpetual isp\u00e1n]]ate,<ref name='Rady_81'>Rady 2000, p. 81.</ref> namely the group of counties where the office of ''isp\u00e1n'' was hereditary in noble families.\n\nElection of the vice-''isp\u00e1ns'' by the assembly of the counties was enacted in 1723, although the noblemen could only choose among four candidates presented by the lord-lieutenant. Following the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], vice-''isp\u00e1ns'' officially took over the responsibility for the management of the whole county administration, but lord-lieutenants presided the most important representative or supervising bodies of the counties. Both offices were abolished with the [[History of Hungary|introduction of the Soviet system of local administration]] in [[Hungary]] in 1950.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[Image:Szabolcs-Earthwork.jpg|190px|thumb|right|alt=Ruins of Szabolcs Castle|Remains of the fortress at [[Szabolcs (village)|Szabolcs]]]]\n{{Quote box\n|quote=\"If a warrior, scorning the just judgment of his ''isp\u00e1n'' appeals to the king, seeking to prove the injustice of the ''isp\u00e1n'', he will owe ten ''pensae'' of gold to the ''isp\u00e1n''. \"\n|source = Laws of King Stephen I II:8<ref>''The Laws of the Medieval Kingdom of Hungary, 1000&ndash;1301'', p. 10.</ref>\n|width  = 190px\n|align  = right\n}}\nThe term ''\u017eupan'' was first recorded in the charter of foundation of the [[Kremsm\u00fcnster Abbey]] as the title of an Avar dignitary.<ref>Engel, R\u00f3na-Tas 1994, p. 290.</ref> The Hungarian word is first attested as a proper name from 1269, and as a title from around 1282.<ref name='Dolovai_344'/>\n\nNo doubt, the [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] word ''isp\u00e1n'' is connected to the term ''[[\u017eupan]]'' (\"head of a ''[[\u017eupa]]''\") in the [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and the modern [[Slovakian language|Slovakian]] languages, and to the synonymous [[Old Church Slavonic]] expression, ''\u017eupan\u044a''.<ref name='Dolovai_344'>Dolovai 2006, p. 344.</ref> Accordingly, the title seems to be a [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] [[loanword]] in the Hungarian language.<ref name='Dolovai_344'/>  \n\nHowever, Dorota Dolovai sees a direct borrowing problematic from [[phonological]] perspective<ref name='Dolovai_344'/> and also [[Andr\u00e1s R\u00f3na-Tas]] says that the omission of the vowel ''u'' during the procedure (''\u017eupan''>''\u0161pan''>''i\u0161pan'') suggests an intermediate (non-Slavic) language.<ref>R\u00f3na-Tas 1999, p. 115.</ref> Several [[Slavist]]s have a different opinion.

Rwanda hoped to depose [[Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila]] and install a government more favorable to Rwanda's interests by quickly taking control of Kinshasa and the strategic western province of [[Kongo Central|Bas-Congo]] (today Kongo Central). On August 4, 1998, joint Rwandan and Ugandan forces launched a [[surprise attack]] on Kitona airbase in Western Congo using [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] civilian airliners. While initially successful in taking control of major ports and infrastructure, Zimbabwean and Angolan intervention prevented the Rwandans and Ugandans from taking control of Kinshasa. The invading forces were forced to withdraw to the jungles of Angola until they were evacuated by air to Rwanda ending December 24, 1998.\n\nToday the operation is studied for its daring initial aerial assault, as well as the intelligence failures on the Rwandan side.\n\n== Prelude ==\n{{Main|Second Congo War#Background|l1=Second Congo War}}\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[First Congo War]], Rwanda and other allied groups had installed [[Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila]] in May 1997 as leader of the newly renamed [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. In turn, Kabila appointed many Rwandans as key officials in his new government and armed forces; including [[James Kabarebe]] who served as the [[Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese army]] Chief of Staff. For over a year Rwandan soldiers and officials supported the Kabila Government, using the influence to export numerous raw materials to Rwanda. By mid-1998, internal ethnic tensions convinced Kabila that Rwandan influence was a threat to his power. On July 13, he removed all Rwandans from government positions and on July 27 ordered all remaining [[Rwandan Patriotic Front|RPA]] and [[Uganda People's Defence Force|UPDF]] soldiers to leave the country. Kabila replaced these losses with friends, local militias, and surviving [[Rwandan genocide|Hutu G\u00e9nocidaires]].{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} [[Banyamulenge]] (Congolese Tutsis) were also removed from power as they were thought to be Rwandan sympathizers.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} These actions angered many in the Rwandan government, as it posed a threat to their influence in the Congo as well as the safety of Tutsis in both the DRC and Rwanda.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1998/08/25/angola-sends-thousands-of-troops-to-back-kabila/c5da7c99-0f4a-469a-8a32-a74d46b79a0d/|title=ANGOLA SENDS THOUSANDS OF TROOPS TO BACK KABILA|date=1998-08-25|work=Washington Post|access-date=2019-03-30|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3uXZAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Great Lakes Conflagration: Second Congo War, 1998 2003|last=Cooper|first=Tom|publisher=Helion & Company Limited|year=2013|isbn=978-1-920143-84-8|location=UK|pages=23\u201332}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/international/1998/09/03/heading-for-an-african-war|title=Heading for an African war|date=1998-09-03|work=The Economist|access-date=2019-03-30|issn=0013-0613}}</ref> [[Paul Kagame]], Rwandan Minister of Defence,  concerned of these outcomes for months, had begun drawing up plans for a second invasion of the Congo in April 1998.

Here they would be able to take control of the economically important [[Kongo Central|Bas-Congo province]], home to Congo's only seaports, as well as the [[Inga dams|Inga Dams]], the main source of electricity for western Congo.

The following day, Rwandan HCU commandos took control of [[Goma International Airport]], hijacking four civilian aircraft, 2 [[Boeing 727]]s and 2 [[Boeing 707]]s, sitting on the runway. On August 4, the commandos were then joined by more Rwandan and Ugandan soldiers, including a Ugandan light artillery unit, numbering over 500 soldiers in total. The pilots were then ordered at gunpoint to fly west to Kitona Air Base.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/10/world/pilot-s-account-seems-to-confirm-rwanda-role-in-congo-strife.html|title=Pilot's Account Seems to Confirm Rwanda Role in Congo Strife|last=French|first=Howard W.|date=1998-08-10|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-03-30|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n== Initial successes ==\n\n=== Landing in Kitona ===\n[[File:Blue Air Lines Boeing 727-100 Potters-1.jpg|left|thumb|9Q-CDLM, one of the 727s used in the initial attack on Kitoma Air Base.]]\nOn the morning of August 4, the two 727s landed first, using their [[airstair]]s to discharge the HCU commandos as the aircraft were still taxiing.<ref name=\":0\" /> The lightly defended Kitona Air Base was quickly captured, and the remaining two 707s then landed and offloaded their troops and supplies. The four aircraft continued to fly between Kitona and Rwanda, and by August 5 over 3,000 Rwandan and Ugandan troops had been airlifted into Kitona. After the airfield was secured, Kabarebe convinced and bribed local Congolese army units to join his invasion force. These new recruits added over 2,000 Congolese Rebels, as well as [[Type 59 tank|Type 59]] and [[Type 62]] tanks and [[ZU-23-2|ZU-23]] anti-aircraft cannons.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Actions on the coast ===\n[[File:Inga04.jpg|thumb|Inga I, one of the [[Inga dams|Inga Dams]], a key early target of the operation.]]\nThis force quickly overwhelmed local Congolese forces loyal to Kabila. By August 5, the nearby oil infrastructure at [[Moanda, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Moanda]] and the port of [[Banana, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Banana]] had been captured. Widespread rape and looting ensued in areas occupied by the Rwandans. August 7 saw the capture of [[Boma, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Boma]], 100&nbsp;km (62 miles) inland of Kitona. On August 10, [[Matadi]], Congo's most important seaport fell to the invaders. Three days later on August 13, the [[Inga dams|Inga Dams]], a key early objective of the operation, were secured. Immediately upon arrival, Kabarebe ordered the turbines shut down, completely cutting off power to the city of Kinshasa.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Chaos in Kinshasa ===\n[[File:Operation Kitona Diagram.png|thumb|1.

This caused panic among the government and general population throughout Kinshasa. Kabila's government and media outlets called upon the population to mobilize to protect the capital and root out those disloyal to the regime. Banyamulenge, [[Tutsi]]s, political opponents, as well as ordinary citizens believed to be enemies were subject to property seizures, imprisonment, rape, torture, and summary execution.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Foreign intervention ==\n=== Zimbabwean intervention ===\n[[File:Alouette III AFZ 1998.svg|thumb|left|Drawing of an Alouette III of the Air Force of Zimbabwe, as deployed in Congo in 1998. As a gunship helicopter, it is armed with two .30 machine guns.]]\nKabila had been in talks with [[Zimbabwe]] since before the outbreak of war, and on August 4 [[Robert Mugabe]], the president of Zimbabwe, and Kabila signed a military cooperation treaty. On August 8 a contingent of [[Special Forces of Zimbabwe|Zimbabwean SAS]] led by Air Marshal [[Perence Shiri]] arrived at [[N'djili Airport|N'Djili Airport]] outside of Kinshasa. This action, code-named '''Operation Sovereignty Legitimacy''', marked the start of Zimbabwean involvement in the Second Congo War.<ref name=\":0\" /> By August 12, over 800 Zimbabwean Paratroopers and several [[EE-9 Cascavel|Cascavel armored cars]] had been airlifted to Kinshasa. Kabila continued his pleas for aid from [[Southern African Development Community|South African Development Community]], and on August 17 Zimbabwe and [[Namibia]] agreed to support his efforts to combat the various threats to his regime. Angola remained supportive, but refrained from entering the war, while [[South Africa]] urged further talks.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> Zimbabwean reinforcement efforts intensified, and by August 22, Zimbabwean troops at N'Djili totaled over 800 ground troops, ground support, and pilots, 15 Cascavels, 8 Fighter and light attack aircraft, and over a dozen [[A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette III|Alouette III]] and [[Bell 412|AB 412]] helicopters configured for both gunship and transport use.\n\n=== Rwandan setbacks ===\nWhile Kabila was searching for allies, Kabarebe continued his advance towards Kinshasa. On August 11, Rwandan forces were ambushed before they could begin an attack on [[Kasangulu]], 45&nbsp;km (28 miles) south of Kinshasa. By August 17 the main Rwandan force had advanced as far as [[Kinsielele]], 30&nbsp;km (18 miles) south of Kinshasa, using country roads before running out of fuel. From this point onward, the Zimbabwean air support proved invaluable, as the Rwandans were relatively ill-equipped to defend themselves from aerial attacks. In this regard they depended entirely upon the FAC mutineer's ZU-23 guns, which they lacked experience in operating. This proved particularly devastating on August 24, when the Rwandan Tanks were spotted by a ZAF helicopter outside of Kasangulu. The lead tank was disabled, giving Zimbabwean paratroopers time to set up an ambush further along the road. In the ensuing skirmish, several of the captured tanks were destroyed, and most of the rest captured. The Rwandans were now delayed several kilometres outside Kinshasa, with little remaining armor and under constant threat of Zimbabwean air attack.\n\n=== Angolan intervention ===\n[[File:Ural trucks, Kwanza 2010.jpg|thumb|Angolan Army Personnel, with equipment similar to that in use in 1998.]]\nBefore beginning the operation, Rwandan intelligence had indicated [[Angola]] had no intention of assisting Kabila's regime.

Instead of attacking along the Kasangulu road a third time, Kabarebe realized the Zimbabweans at N'Djili were both outnumbered and the only real support for the Kabila government, given the unreliable performance of the remaining FAC troops. Zimbabwean Major-General [[Mike Nyambuya]] realized this and on August 25 deployed numerous SAS teams across the outskirts of Kinshasa with the aim of delaying the Rwandan advance. While these were initially effective, on the 26th FAC mutineers disguised as retreating FAC soldiers still loyal to Kabila managed to slip into the city. One of these groups headed for N'Djili Airfield, where they managed to get within 100m of the airport before being found out and gunned down by the Zimbabwean troops guarding it.\n\nThe second wave of Rwandans and FAC mutineers managed to overwhelm the defenders, and the Rwandans captured the western end of the runway as well as the main terminal and hangars. The control tower and eastern end of the runway remained in Zimbabwean hands. From here all remaining ZAF helicopters and jets were made airborne. They continuously pounded the Rwandan positions throughout the city for the remainder of the day. That afternoon two ZAF helicopters extracted Kabila from the presidential palace who was then flown to safety in [[Lubumbashi]]. Sporadic fighting continued throughout Kinshasa for the remainder of the 26th.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://warisboring.com/bomb-the-other-side-of-the-runway/|title=Bomb the Other Side of the Runway!|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-30}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn the morning of August 27 Kabarebe deployed his remaining tanks and anti-aircraft guns in a final attempt to capture the rest of the airfield. Throughout the day ZAF aircraft flew continuous sorties, taking off from the north side of the runway under Zimbabwean control, bombing the Rwandan positions on the south side, then returning to be refueled and rearmed. At the peak of the fighting, average turnaround for the aircraft was reduced to less than five minutes.<ref name=\":0\" /> Due to the constant attack from the air and determined defense of the remainder of the airfield, the first Rwandan assault was unable to take any ground. A second attack later in the afternoon also failed and resulted in the loss of all remaining tanks and anti-aircraft guns.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":6\" />\n\nNyambuya ordered a counterattack to retake the airfield early on the 28th which encountered heavy resistance. Eventually the Rwandans were dislodged and forced to retreat to the [[Kimbanseke]] and [[Masina, Kinshasa|Masina]] neighborhoods where they had prepared trenches and other defensive works throughout the previous few days. Two days of [[trench warfare]] ensued until August 30, when Kabarebe and the remaining Rwandan and Ugandan troops abandoned the FAC mutineers, and fled south into the Jungle. This marked the end of organized fighting for Kinshasa and Operation Kitona.\n\n== Kabarebe's retreat ==\nKabarebe's forces were now in a difficult position; they were nearly 1,500&nbsp;km (930 miles) from the nearest allied forces in [[Kivu]] and surrounded on three sides. To the west lay Kitona, which was now under the control of the Angolans who were now headed towards Kinshasa, north was the [[Congo River]] which Kabarebe was unable to cross due to a lack of boats, and east lay 1,500&nbsp;km of jungle and the Congolese Army. As a result, they headed south towards Angola and friendly UNITA forces. September 1, Angolan troops with support from Zimbabwean SAS commandos finally recaptured the Inga Dams, who's Ugandan defenders slipped away to rendezvous with the remaining Rwandan attack force. By this point Kabarebe had identified an airfield outside the Angolan town [[Maquela do Zombo]] which was defended by over 400 Angolans.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> The Rwandan troops took time to regain strength and in mid-September launched an attack on the airfield with the assistance of local UNITA insurgents, quickly taking control of it.\n\nThe runway however was too short, and needed to be lengthened in order to allow large cargo planes to land to complete the evacuation. For the next two months, Kabarebe's men worked on lengthening the runway from 1,400m to 1,800m. During this period they also fended off numerous Angolan attacks, including one consisting of over 26 armored vehicles.<ref name=\":2\" /> Once the runway was lengthened transports undertook over 30 flights to evacuate the remaining Rwandans and Ugandans by cover of darkness. By December 24, all remaining Rwandans and Ugandans, numbering around 3,000, had returned to Rwanda.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Aftermath ==\n[[File:James Kabarebe.jpg|thumb|James Kabarebe in 2012.]]\nFollowing Kabarebe's retreat, Congolese, Zimbabwean, and Angolan troops spent much of the next few months re-establishing order throughout western Congo. In the ensuing violence thousands of suspected rebels were raped, tortured, and killed. The remaining ~12,000 FAC mutineers either fled into the Jungle, switched sides again, or were killed outright.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThree years after the Rwandan failure to depose Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila, he was assassinated by his own bodyguards on 16 January 2001.

Rwanda hoped to depose [[Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila]] and install a government more favorable to Rwanda's interests by quickly taking control of Kinshasa and the strategic western province of [[Kongo Central|Bas-Congo]] (today Kongo Central). On August 4, 1998, joint Rwandan and Ugandan forces launched a [[surprise attack]] on Kitona airbase in Western Congo using [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] civilian airliners. While initially successful in taking control of major ports and infrastructure, Zimbabwean and Angolan intervention prevented the Rwandans and Ugandans from taking control of Kinshasa. The invading forces were forced to withdraw to the jungles of Angola until they were evacuated by air to Rwanda ending December 24, 1998.\n\nToday the operation is studied for its daring initial aerial assault, as well as the intelligence failures on the Rwandan side.\n\n== Prelude ==\n{{Main|Second Congo War#Background|l1=Second Congo War}}\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[First Congo War]], Rwanda and other allied groups had installed [[Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila]] in May 1997 as leader of the newly renamed [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. In turn, Kabila appointed many Rwandans as key officials in his new government and armed forces; including [[James Kabarebe]] who served as the [[Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese army]] Chief of Staff. For over a year Rwandan soldiers and officials supported the Kabila Government, using the influence to export numerous raw materials to Rwanda. By mid-1998, internal ethnic tensions convinced Kabila that Rwandan influence was a threat to his power. On July 13, he removed all Rwandans from government positions and on July 27 ordered all remaining [[Rwandan Patriotic Front|RPA]] and [[Uganda People's Defence Force|UPDF]] soldiers to leave the country. Kabila replaced these losses with friends, local militias, and surviving [[Rwandan genocide|Hutu G\u00e9nocidaires]].{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} [[Banyamulenge]] (Congolese Tutsis) were also removed from power as they were thought to be Rwandan sympathizers.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} These actions angered many in the Rwandan government, as it posed a threat to their influence in the Congo as well as the safety of Tutsis in both the DRC and Rwanda.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1998/08/25/angola-sends-thousands-of-troops-to-back-kabila/c5da7c99-0f4a-469a-8a32-a74d46b79a0d/|title=ANGOLA SENDS THOUSANDS OF TROOPS TO BACK KABILA|date=1998-08-25|work=Washington Post|access-date=2019-03-30|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3uXZAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Great Lakes Conflagration: Second Congo War, 1998 2003|last=Cooper|first=Tom|publisher=Helion & Company Limited|year=2013|isbn=978-1-920143-84-8|location=UK|pages=23\u201332}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/international/1998/09/03/heading-for-an-african-war|title=Heading for an African war|date=1998-09-03|work=The Economist|access-date=2019-03-30|issn=0013-0613}}</ref> [[Paul Kagame]], Rwandan Minister of Defence,  concerned of these outcomes for months, had begun drawing up plans for a second invasion of the Congo in April 1998.

Here they would be able to take control of the economically important [[Kongo Central|Bas-Congo province]], home to Congo's only seaports, as well as the [[Inga dams|Inga Dams]], the main source of electricity for western Congo.

The following day, Rwandan HCU commandos took control of [[Goma International Airport]], hijacking four civilian aircraft, 2 [[Boeing 727]]s and 2 [[Boeing 707]]s, sitting on the runway. On August 4, the commandos were then joined by more Rwandan and Ugandan soldiers, including a Ugandan light artillery unit, numbering over 500 soldiers in total.

The four aircraft continued to fly between Kitona and Rwanda, and by August 5 over 3,000 Rwandan and Ugandan troops had been airlifted into Kitona. After the airfield was secured, Kabarebe convinced and bribed local Congolese army units to join his invasion force. These new recruits added over 2,000 Congolese Rebels, as well as [[Type 59 tank|Type 59]] and [[Type 62]] tanks and [[ZU-23-2|ZU-23]] anti-aircraft cannons.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Actions on the coast ===\n[[File:Inga04.jpg|thumb|Inga I, one of the [[Inga dams|Inga Dams]], a key early target of the operation.]]\nThis force quickly overwhelmed local Congolese forces loyal to Kabila. By August 5, the nearby oil infrastructure at [[Moanda, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Moanda]] and the port of [[Banana, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Banana]] had been captured. Widespread rape and looting ensued in areas occupied by the Rwandans. August 7 saw the capture of [[Boma, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Boma]], 100&nbsp;km (62 miles) inland of Kitona. On August 10, [[Matadi]], Congo's most important seaport fell to the invaders. Three days later on August 13, the [[Inga dams|Inga Dams]], a key early objective of the operation, were secured. Immediately upon arrival, Kabarebe ordered the turbines shut down, completely cutting off power to the city of Kinshasa.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Chaos in Kinshasa ===\n[[File:Operation Kitona Diagram.png|thumb|1.

This caused panic among the government and general population throughout Kinshasa. Kabila's government and media outlets called upon the population to mobilize to protect the capital and root out those disloyal to the regime. Banyamulenge, [[Tutsi]]s, political opponents, as well as ordinary citizens believed to be enemies were subject to property seizures, imprisonment, rape, torture, and summary execution.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Foreign intervention ==\n=== Zimbabwean intervention ===\n[[File:Alouette III AFZ 1998.svg|thumb|left|Drawing of an Alouette III of the Air Force of Zimbabwe, as deployed in Congo in 1998. As a gunship helicopter, it is armed with two .30 machine guns.]]\nKabila had been in talks with [[Zimbabwe]] since before the outbreak of war, and on August 4 [[Robert Mugabe]], the president of Zimbabwe, and Kabila signed a military cooperation treaty. On August 8 a contingent of [[Special Forces of Zimbabwe|Zimbabwean SAS]] led by Air Marshal [[Perence Shiri]] arrived at [[N'djili Airport|N'Djili Airport]] outside of Kinshasa. This action, code-named '''Operation Sovereignty Legitimacy''', marked the start of Zimbabwean involvement in the Second Congo War.<ref name=\":0\" /> By August 12, over 800 Zimbabwean Paratroopers and several [[EE-9 Cascavel|Cascavel armored cars]] had been airlifted to Kinshasa. Kabila continued his pleas for aid from [[Southern African Development Community|South African Development Community]], and on August 17 Zimbabwe and [[Namibia]] agreed to support his efforts to combat the various threats to his regime. Angola remained supportive, but refrained from entering the war, while [[South Africa]] urged further talks.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> Zimbabwean reinforcement efforts intensified, and by August 22, Zimbabwean troops at N'Djili totaled over 800 ground troops, ground support, and pilots, 15 Cascavels, 8 Fighter and light attack aircraft, and over a dozen [[A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette III|Alouette III]] and [[Bell 412|AB 412]] helicopters configured for both gunship and transport use.\n\n=== Rwandan setbacks ===\nWhile Kabila was searching for allies, Kabarebe continued his advance towards Kinshasa. On August 11, Rwandan forces were ambushed before they could begin an attack on [[Kasangulu]], 45&nbsp;km (28 miles) south of Kinshasa. By August 17 the main Rwandan force had advanced as far as [[Kinsielele]], 30&nbsp;km (18 miles) south of Kinshasa, using country roads before running out of fuel. From this point onward, the Zimbabwean air support proved invaluable, as the Rwandans were relatively ill-equipped to defend themselves from aerial attacks. In this regard they depended entirely upon the FAC mutineer's ZU-23 guns, which they lacked experience in operating. This proved particularly devastating on August 24, when the Rwandan Tanks were spotted by a ZAF helicopter outside of Kasangulu. The lead tank was disabled, giving Zimbabwean paratroopers time to set up an ambush further along the road. In the ensuing skirmish, several of the captured tanks were destroyed, and most of the rest captured. The Rwandans were now delayed several kilometres outside Kinshasa, with little remaining armor and under constant threat of Zimbabwean air attack.\n\n=== Angolan intervention ===\n[[File:Ural trucks, Kwanza 2010.jpg|thumb|Angolan Army Personnel, with equipment similar to that in use in 1998.]]\nBefore beginning the operation, Rwandan intelligence had indicated [[Angola]] had no intention of assisting Kabila's regime.

Instead of attacking along the Kasangulu road a third time, Kabarebe realized the Zimbabweans at N'Djili were both outnumbered and the only real support for the Kabila government, given the unreliable performance of the remaining FAC troops. Zimbabwean Major-General [[Mike Nyambuya]] realized this and on August 25 deployed numerous SAS teams across the outskirts of Kinshasa with the aim of delaying the Rwandan advance. While these were initially effective, on the 26th FAC mutineers disguised as retreating FAC soldiers still loyal to Kabila managed to slip into the city. One of these groups headed for N'Djili Airfield, where they managed to get within 100m of the airport before being found out and gunned down by the Zimbabwean troops guarding it.\n\nThe second wave of Rwandans and FAC mutineers managed to overwhelm the defenders, and the Rwandans captured the western end of the runway as well as the main terminal and hangars. The control tower and eastern end of the runway remained in Zimbabwean hands. From here all remaining ZAF helicopters and jets were made airborne.

To the west lay Kitona, which was now under the control of the Angolans who were now headed towards Kinshasa, north was the [[Congo River]] which Kabarebe was unable to cross due to a lack of boats, and east lay 1,500&nbsp;km of jungle and the Congolese Army. As a result, they headed south towards Angola and friendly UNITA forces. September 1, Angolan troops with support from Zimbabwean SAS commandos finally recaptured the Inga Dams, who's Ugandan defenders slipped away to rendezvous with the remaining Rwandan attack force. By this point Kabarebe had identified an airfield outside the Angolan town [[Maquela do Zombo]] which was defended by over 400 Angolans.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> The Rwandan troops took time to regain strength and in mid-September launched an attack on the airfield with the assistance of local UNITA insurgents, quickly taking control of it.\n\nThe runway however was too short, and needed to be lengthened in order to allow large cargo planes to land to complete the evacuation.

Coleman, who received [[death sentences]] in three states, was [[executed]] by the state of [[Ohio]] in 2002. Brown was also sentenced to death in [[Indiana]], but the death penalty was [[Commutation (law)|commuted]] to [[life imprisonment]] without possibility of parole in [[Illinois]].\n\n==Criminal Background==\n\n===Alton Coleman===\nAlton Coleman was born on November 6, 1955, in [[Waukegan, Illinois|Waukegan]], [[Illinois]]. Coleman's mother worked three jobs, and he lived with his 73-year-old grandmother. A [[middle-school]] dropout, Coleman was well known to Illinois [[law enforcement]], having been charged with [[sex crime]]s six times between 1973 and 1983. Two of those cases were dismissed, with Coleman pleading [[Guilty plea|guilty]] to lesser charges in two and twice being [[acquittal|acquitted]]. Coleman was scheduled to go on trial in Illinois on charges stemming from the [[rape]] of a 14-year-old girl when he fled and began his killing spree.\n\nColeman was diagnosed with mixed [[personality disorder]] with [[antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]], [[narcissistic]] and [[obsessive compulsive disorder|obsessive]] features, with additional diagnoses including [[epileptic spasms]], [[psychosis]] and [[borderline personality disorder]].<ref>[http://federal-circuits.vlex.com/vid/alton-coleman-betty-mitchell-warden-36308103 Appeal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117082918/http://federal-circuits.vlex.com/vid/alton-coleman-betty-mitchell-warden-36308103 |date=January 17, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n===Debra Brown===\nDebra Brown, one of eleven children, is borderline [[intellectual disability|intellectually disabled]], suffered [[head trauma]] as a child, and was diagnosed with [[dependent personality disorder]] by a psychiatrist.<ref name=\"Brown vs. State\">{{cite web |title=BROWN vs. STATE {{!}} FindLaw's Supreme Court of Indiana case and opinions. |url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/in-supreme-court/1074796.html |website=Findlaw |publisher=Thomson Reuters. |accessdate=September 24, 2018 |date=July 17, 1998}}</ref> She was [[engaged]] to another man when she met Coleman in 1983, but left her family and moved in with him shortly afterwards. Although a willing participant in Coleman's assaults and murders, Brown had no history of violence or any criminal history prior to their relationship.\n\n==Murders==\n\n===Wisconsin and Illinois===\nColeman and Brown committed their first murder when they killed 9-year-old Vernita Wheat from [[Kenosha, Wisconsin|Kenosha]], [[Wisconsin]]. After Coleman had befriended her mother, Juanita Wheat, he abducted Vernita and took her to Waukegan on May 29, 1984.<ref name=\"wilkinson2002\" /> Vernita's badly [[human decomposition|decomposed]] [[corpse]] was discovered on June 19 in an abandoned building four blocks from Coleman's grandmother's apartment.<ref name=\"wilkinson2002\" /> It was determined she had been raped, and the cause of death was [[ligature strangulation]].\n\nOn May 31, Coleman befriended Robert Carpenter in Waukegan and spent the night at his home. The next day he borrowed Carpenter's car to go to the store and never returned.\n\n===Indiana and Michigan===\nIn June 1984, Coleman and Brown were in [[Gary, Indiana|Gary]], [[Indiana]] and encountered two young girls there: 9-year-old Annie <!-- Out of respect for her privacy, the author (User:Marklemagne) is unilaterally withholding Annie's surname.

She had been raped and killed by ligature strangulation.<ref name=\"trutv\" />\n\nOn June 28, Coleman and Brown entered the home of Mr. and Mrs. Palmer-Jones of [[Dearborn Heights, Michigan]], whom they beat severely. Coleman ripped the telephone from their wall before stealing money and their car.\n\n===Ohio===\nOn July 5, Coleman and Brown arrived in [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], [[Ohio]], where Coleman befriended Virginia Temple, the mother of several children. When Temple stopped communicating with her relatives, they entered her home and found her young children alone and frightened.

Later that day, Coleman and Brown visited the [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]] home of [[Reverend]] Millard Gay and his wife Kathryn. The two stayed with the Gays and accompanied them to a religious service on July 9, where the next day the Gays dropped off the couple in downtown [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]].\n\nOn July 12, Tonnie Storey, a 15-year-old girl who lived in Cincinnati's [[Over-the-Rhine]] neighborhood, disappeared; her body was discovered eight days later.<ref name=\"wilkinson2002\" /><ref name=\"mp1\">{{cite web | last =Ludlow | first =Randy | title =Clock runs out on Alton Coleman | work =Cincinnati Post | publisher =| date = April 26, 2002 | url =http://www.murderpedia.org/male.C/c1/coleman-alton.htm | accessdate = April 4, 2013}}</ref> A [[bracelet]] that had been stolen from the Temples was found under Storey's body. On the day of Storey's disappearance, the [[FBI]] added Coleman to its [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives|Ten Most Wanted List]] as a \"special addition\". Coleman was just the tenth person since the initiation of the list in 1950 to merit inclusion in such a manner.\n\nColeman and Brown bicycled into [[Norwood, Ohio|Norwood]] on July 13 at about 9:30&nbsp;a.m. Less than three hours later, they drove away in a car belonging to Harry Walters, who they left [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]], and his wife Marlene, who was raped and beaten to death. Walters survived and later testified that they had met the couple to discuss their potential purchase of a [[Campervan|camper]], but that Coleman attacked him with a wooden [[candlestick]]. The [[coroner]] indicated Marlene had been bludgeoned approximately 20 to 25 times during her violent assault. Shards of a broken soda bottle which bore Coleman's fingerprints were found in the living room, and bloody footprints made by two different pairs of shoes were found in the basement. The Walters' red [[Plymouth Reliant]], as well as money, jewelry, and shoes, were stolen. Two bicycles, clothes and shoes not belonging to the Walters had been left behind.\n\n===Kentucky, return to Ohio, Illinois and Indiana===\nTwo days later, the Plymouth was found abandoned in [[Kentucky]], where Coleman and Brown had [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] Oline Carmical, Jr., a college professor from [[Williamsburg, Kentucky|Williamsburg]], and drove back to Ohio with Carmical locked in the trunk of his car.<ref name=\"wilkinson2002\" /> On July 17, they abandoned this stolen vehicle in Dayton, and Carmical, who was still locked in the trunk, was rescued by authorities. Coleman and Brown returned to the home of the Gays, accosting them with guns. Reverend Gay, who at this time recognized Coleman as a wanted [[fugitive]], asked, \"Why you want to do us like that, like this?\" Coleman responded: \"I'm not going to kill you, but we generally kill them where we go.\" Coleman and Brown took their car and headed back toward [[Evanston, Illinois]]. Along the way, they stole another car in [[Indianapolis]] and killed its owner, 75-year-old Eugene Scott.<ref name=\"trutv\">{{cite web | last = Gribben | first = Mark | title = Alton Coleman & Debra Brown: Odyssey of Mayhem | work = Crime Library | publisher = truTV-Turner-Time Warner | url = http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/partners/coleman/index_1.html | accessdate = April 4, 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080513154946/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/partners/coleman/index_1.html | archive-date = May 13, 2008 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n==Arrest and conviction==\nThree days later, on July 20, Coleman and Brown were arrested in Evanston.<ref name=\"crimeindetroit\">{{cite web | last = Flanigan | first = Brian | author2 = Joe Swickard | title = Alton Coleman is Arrested | work = Detroit Free Press | date = July 21, 1984 | url = http://www.crimeindetroit.com/Documents/Alton%20Coleman%20is%20Arrested.pdf | accessdate = April 4, 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121018170825/http://crimeindetroit.com/Documents/Alton%20Coleman%20is%20Arrested.pdf | archive-date = October 18, 2012 | url-status = dead }}</ref> As they walked westward across an intersection, they passed immediately in front of a motorist who was from Coleman's neighborhood in Waukegan. The motorist drove north to a gas station and notified the police. The couple were soon spotted sitting on portable bleachers in empty Mason Park. As two police sergeants approached Coleman, Brown was observed walking away toward the rear of the park. Two other officers stopped Brown as she tried to exit the park, searched her, and found a gun in her purse. The pair were taken into custody without incident and transported to the Evanston police station, where both were identified by their fingerprints.\n  \nAs Coleman was [[strip-search]]ed, a [[steak knife]] was found between two pairs of sweat socks he was wearing. A shopping bag full of varied T-shirts and caps was found in the couple's possession; officers learned that the pair stopped every three to four blocks as they walked and changed shirts and caps.<ref>Arresting officers, Scharm, Trigoura, Hynds, Walker, Grinnel</ref> A week after their arrest, more than 50 law enforcement officials from six [[jurisdiction]]s met to plan their strategy for [[prosecution|prosecuting]] Coleman and Brown. Seeking the [[death penalty]] for Coleman and Brown, Michigan was quickly ruled out because it did not employ capital punishment. It was decided to give Ohio the first attempt at sentencing, with [[United States Attorney|U.S. Attorney]] [[Dan K.

Coleman, who received [[death sentences]] in three states, was [[executed]] by the state of [[Ohio]] in 2002. Brown was also sentenced to death in [[Indiana]], but the death penalty was [[Commutation (law)|commuted]] to [[life imprisonment]] without possibility of parole in [[Illinois]].\n\n==Criminal Background==\n\n===Alton Coleman===\nAlton Coleman was born on November 6, 1955, in [[Waukegan, Illinois|Waukegan]], [[Illinois]]. Coleman's mother worked three jobs, and he lived with his 73-year-old grandmother. A [[middle-school]] dropout, Coleman was well known to Illinois [[law enforcement]], having been charged with [[sex crime]]s six times between 1973 and 1983. Two of those cases were dismissed, with Coleman pleading [[Guilty plea|guilty]] to lesser charges in two and twice being [[acquittal|acquitted]]. Coleman was scheduled to go on trial in Illinois on charges stemming from the [[rape]] of a 14-year-old girl when he fled and began his killing spree.\n\nColeman was diagnosed with mixed [[personality disorder]] with [[antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]], [[narcissistic]] and [[obsessive compulsive disorder|obsessive]] features, with additional diagnoses including [[epileptic spasms]], [[psychosis]] and [[borderline personality disorder]].<ref>[http://federal-circuits.vlex.com/vid/alton-coleman-betty-mitchell-warden-36308103 Appeal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117082918/http://federal-circuits.vlex.com/vid/alton-coleman-betty-mitchell-warden-36308103 |date=January 17, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n===Debra Brown===\nDebra Brown, one of eleven children, is borderline [[intellectual disability|intellectually disabled]], suffered [[head trauma]] as a child, and was diagnosed with [[dependent personality disorder]] by a psychiatrist.<ref name=\"Brown vs. State\">{{cite web |title=BROWN vs. STATE {{!}} FindLaw's Supreme Court of Indiana case and opinions. |url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/in-supreme-court/1074796.html |website=Findlaw |publisher=Thomson Reuters. |accessdate=September 24, 2018 |date=July 17, 1998}}</ref> She was [[engaged]] to another man when she met Coleman in 1983, but left her family and moved in with him shortly afterwards. Although a willing participant in Coleman's assaults and murders, Brown had no history of violence or any criminal history prior to their relationship.\n\n==Murders==\n\n===Wisconsin and Illinois===\nColeman and Brown committed their first murder when they killed 9-year-old Vernita Wheat from [[Kenosha, Wisconsin|Kenosha]], [[Wisconsin]]. After Coleman had befriended her mother, Juanita Wheat, he abducted Vernita and took her to Waukegan on May 29, 1984.<ref name=\"wilkinson2002\" /> Vernita's badly [[human decomposition|decomposed]] [[corpse]] was discovered on June 19 in an abandoned building four blocks from Coleman's grandmother's apartment.<ref name=\"wilkinson2002\" /> It was determined she had been raped, and the cause of death was [[ligature strangulation]].\n\nOn May 31, Coleman befriended Robert Carpenter in Waukegan and spent the night at his home. The next day he borrowed Carpenter's car to go to the store and never returned.\n\n===Indiana and Michigan===\nIn June 1984, Coleman and Brown were in [[Gary, Indiana|Gary]], [[Indiana]] and encountered two young girls there: 9-year-old Annie <!-- Out of respect for her privacy, the author (User:Marklemagne) is unilaterally withholding Annie's surname. It is available to interested parties in the various court records. --><!-- This is an admirable but futile effort. It's also in the news reports. --> and her [[niece]] 7-year-old Tamika Turks.<ref name=\"mccain2002\" /> The couple [[sexual assault|sexually assaulted]] the two children.

She had been raped and killed by ligature strangulation.<ref name=\"trutv\" />\n\nOn June 28, Coleman and Brown entered the home of Mr. and Mrs. Palmer-Jones of [[Dearborn Heights, Michigan]], whom they beat severely. Coleman ripped the telephone from their wall before stealing money and their car.\n\n===Ohio===\nOn July 5, Coleman and Brown arrived in [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], [[Ohio]], where Coleman befriended Virginia Temple, the mother of several children. When Temple stopped communicating with her relatives, they entered her home and found her young children alone and frightened. Temple and her eldest child, 9-year-old Rachelle, had been strangled to death and left in a [[Basement#Crawl space|crawl space]].<ref name=\"mp5\">{{cite web | last = | title = Panel weighs arguments about killer's fate | work = Murderpedia  | publisher = Columbus Dispatch | date = April 17, 2002 | url = http://www.murderpedia.org/male.C/c1/coleman-alton.htm | accessdate = April 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn the same morning as the Temple murders, Coleman and Brown entered the home of Frank and Dorothy Duvendack in Toledo, who were bound with electrical cords which had been cut.

On the day of Storey's disappearance, the [[FBI]] added Coleman to its [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives|Ten Most Wanted List]] as a \"special addition\". Coleman was just the tenth person since the initiation of the list in 1950 to merit inclusion in such a manner.\n\nColeman and Brown bicycled into [[Norwood, Ohio|Norwood]] on July 13 at about 9:30&nbsp;a.m. Less than three hours later, they drove away in a car belonging to Harry Walters, who they left [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]], and his wife Marlene, who was raped and beaten to death. Walters survived and later testified that had met the couple to discuss their potential purchase of a [[Campervan|camper]], but that Coleman attacked him with a wooden [[candlestick]]. The [[coroner]] indicated Marlene had been bludgeoned approximately 20 to 25 times during her violent assault. Shards of a broken soda bottle which bore Coleman's fingerprints were found in the living room, and bloody footprints made by two different pairs of shoes were found in the basement. The Walters' red [[Plymouth Reliant]], as well as money, jewelry, and shoes, were stolen. Two bicycles, clothes and shoes not belonging to the Walters had been left behind.\n\n===Kentucky, return to Ohio, Illinois and Indiana===\nTwo days later, the Plymouth was found abandoned in [[Kentucky]], where Coleman and Brown had [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] Oline Carmical, Jr., a college professor from [[Williamsburg, Kentucky|Williamsburg]], and drove back to Ohio with Carmical locked in the trunk of his car.<ref name=\"wilkinson2002\" /> On July 17, they abandoned this stolen vehicle in Dayton, and Carmical, who was still locked in the trunk, was rescued by authorities. Coleman and Brown returned to the home of the Gays, accosting them with guns. Reverend Gay, who at this time recognized Coleman as a wanted [[fugitive]], asked, \"Why you want to do us like that, like this?\" Coleman responded: \"I'm not going to kill you, but we generally kill them where we go.\" Coleman and Brown took their car and headed back toward [[Evanston, Illinois]].

The motorist drove north to a gas station and notified the police. The couple were soon spotted sitting on portable bleachers in empty Mason Park. As two police sergeants approached Coleman, Brown was observed walking away toward the rear of the park. Two other officers stopped Brown as she tried to exit the park, searched her, and found a gun in her purse. The pair were taken into custody without incident and transported to the Evanston police station, where both were identified by their fingerprints.\n  \nAs Coleman was [[strip-search]]ed, a [[steak knife]] was found between two pairs of sweat socks he was wearing. A shopping bag full of varied T-shirts and caps was found in the couple's possession; officers learned that the pair stopped every three to four blocks as they walked and changed shirts and caps.<ref>Arresting officers, Scharm, Trigoura, Hynds, Walker, Grinnel</ref> A week after their arrest, more than 50 law enforcement officials from six [[jurisdiction]]s met to plan their strategy for [[prosecution|prosecuting]] Coleman and Brown.

It was decided to give Ohio the first attempt at sentencing, with [[United States Attorney|U.S. Attorney]] [[Dan K.

I had fun out of it.\" She was also given a death sentence for the murder of Tamika Turks in Indiana; however that sentence was ultimately commuted to 140 years imprisonment in 2018.<ref>{{cite web |title='We have no justice': Serial killer's death sentence canceled, to the shock of local victim's family |url=https://www.nwitimes.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/we-have-no-justice-serial-killer-s-death-sentence-canceled/article_9fa319eb-19c7-58c9-a80b-b2f063821baf.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181230153625/https://www.nwitimes.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/we-have-no-justice-serial-killer-s-death-sentence-canceled/article_9fa319eb-19c7-58c9-a80b-b2f063821baf.html |archivedate=December 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nBrown is currently serving her sentence without possibility of parole at the [[Dayton Correctional Institution]] in Dayton, Ohio. She finally expressed remorse for her crimes when she apologized to the victims' families in a video in 2005.\n\n==Racial motive==\nSome authorities believe that Coleman and Brown (who are both [[African-American]]) usually selected black victims because they knew they would blend in better in the black community, noting that their crimes lacked a [[racism|racial motive]]. However, on page 184 in ''The Anatomy of Motive'', [[John E. Douglas]], a retired FBI [[Profiler (criminology)|profiler]], states that Coleman, in the middle of a vicious sexual assault, \"went into a practically incoherent tirade about how blacks were forcing him to rape and murder other blacks, as if that could somehow explain and justify his actions.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=The Anatomy of Motive |url=http://www.johndouglasmindhunter.com/research/synopsis_anatomy.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208122813/http://www.johndouglasmindhunter.com/research/synopsis_anatomy.php |archivedate=December 8, 2010}}</ref> Coleman and Brown left a racist slogan - \"I hate niggers.

''P. caffra'' has never attracted much attention from horticulturalists. It was induced to flower at [[Kew Gardens]] in May 1893, but this failed to kindle any further interest in the species.

It occurs from sea level to 2100m, always on southern slopes where the terrain is broken and rocky, or mountainous. It usually forms open stands in which it is the single large shrub or tree; these stands can cover large areas.\n\n''Protea caffra'' subsp. ''gazensis'' occurs in the [[Eastern Highlands]] along the border of [[Mozambique]] and [[Zimbabwe]], including the [[Nyanga Mountains]] and [[Chimanimani Mountains]], and on [[Mount Gorongosa]] in Mozambique.

Where winters are cold and dry the plant has stiff, thick, pale green leaves, while as the distribution moves westwards the leaves become larger, softer, darker and more pliant. The flowers are generally pinkish-red to [[carmine]] with green at the base, and are produced during a clearly defined 6&nbsp;\u2013 8 week period; this period may begin as early as October in coastal regions, and as late as December in higher regions. The flower heads produce a sweet, slightly sulphurous odour that attracts [[Scarabaeidae|scarab beetles]] in large numbers. The dense, fissured bark provides the trees with a large measure of [[fire ecology|fire resistance]]. The bark can be used medicinally.\n\n==Cultivation==\nA very hardy [[perennial]] shrub that will survive temperatures of at least \u22125 degrees Celsius. The seeds will germinate in the summer 22 days after planting, and the young plants will reach a height of 10&nbsp;cm in their first year.
