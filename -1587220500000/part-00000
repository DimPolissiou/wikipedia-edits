It therefore required a large build of [[Co-Co locomotives|Co-Co]] diesel locomotives with [[road switcher]] cabs to achieve this aim. This required locomotives producing at least 2,600&nbsp;hp (1,900&nbsp;kW) and began looking at various [[Diesel-electric train|diesel-electric]] designs.\n\nInitially, the Indian railways invited tenders to build locomotives to the new specification.The following responses were received:\n\n* ALCO submitted their model(RSD29 / DL560C) with 2600&nbsp;hp, 16-cylinder, 4-stroke turbo-supercharged engine with Co-Co bogies.\n* [[Electro-Motive Diesel|General Motors Electro-Motive Division]] (EMD) submitted their [[EMD SD24|SD24]], given model number GT16 for the India export version. They had Co-Co bogies with 16-cylinder 2-stroke turbo-supercharged engines.\n\nEach company submitted prototypes and Indian Railways designated these prototypes as the WDM-2 class and [[Indian locomotive class WDM-4|WDM-4]] class respectively. Technologically the General Motors WDM-4 was superior to ALCO's WDM-2, but Indian Railways required a transfer of technology agreement that would allow these locomotives to be ingeniously manufactured in India. Since General Motors did not agree to the transfer of technology agreement, the ALCo prototype was selected for production.\n\nHowever, even before the arrival of WDM-2 another type of diesel locomotive was imported from ALCo beginning in 1957. This locomotive was classified as [[Indian locomotive class WDM-1|WDM-1]].However WDM-1s were not selected for mass production because of having only one forward cab at one end which needed a lot of turntables. \n\n== Production History ==\nThe first few prototype WDM-2 were imported with #18040 being the first WDM-2 of India. The need for a large number of locomotives quickly was deemed paramount. After [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] (DLW) completed construction of its factory in Varanasi, production of the locomotives began in India.The first 12 locos were built using kits imported from ALCO(order no. D3389) in the United States. The first diesel loco assembled in DLW being #18233 and the first fully-built WDM-2 from DLW was 18299. After that DLW started manufacturing the WDM-2 locomotives from their own components. Since then over 2,800 locomotives have been manufactured and the WDM-2 has become the most popular locomotive in India with the very last one being #16887.\n\nWhile ALCO went bankrupt, DLW varanasi successfully adapted the technology and produced may upgraded versions which were exported to many BG countries. Later a number of modifications were made and a few sub classes were created. This includes WDM-2A, WDM-2B and WDM-3A (formerly WDM-2C). Now a few WDM-2 locos are being rebuilt by Diesel Loco Modernization Works (DLMW) Patiala, Punjab. These are fitted with Daulat Ram DBR's.\n\n== Service History ==\nBy 1967 the first trains were being migrated to diesel and the initial high speed foray was the [[Mumbai Rajdhani Express|Mumbai Rajdhani]] with the WDM-2. The other trains dieselised were the premier mails and expresses where the WDM2 ( and  to a lesser and localized extent,the WDM4)  hauled an augmented load of 17 coaches and shaved off 4 to 5 hours over a 1500 km run particularly in systems where WP speeds were lower than other double-line systems like ER,CR and WR.\n\nSome of the trains were end to end WDM2 like the [[Himgiri Superfast Express|Himgiri]] and [[Tamil Nadu Express|Tamil Nadu]] but some were electric hauled for the part run. All averaged speeds well over 65 kmph. Some had the benefit of double line traction  but the Himgiri was running on large single line stretches  and the Tamil Nadu managed over 70 kmph.The WDM-2 locos have a maximum speed of {{convert|120|km/h|abbr=on}},<ref name=\"interactive\">{{cite web|url=http://www.irfca.org/docs/wdm2-interactive.html|title=Interactive Diagram of the WDM-2 Locomotive|author=Sheeju Chandran|date=|work=|publisher=Indian Railways Fan Club|accessdate=April 2, 2010}}</ref> restricted to {{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on}} when run long hood forward - the gear ratio is 65:18.\n\n=== Maintenance ===\nThe WDM-2 had a maintenance schedule of 3000km or 10-days which was recommended by Alco. These have been extended by 20 days to 30 days by using better and more efficient lubrication oils and other component fluids and improving some bearings for the suspension.The original WDM-2 bearings were very failure prone and often required minor repairing.However the WDM-2 was very easy to operate and maintain because of its simple construction and mechanics and was very reliable.This maintenance is usually done at the nearest Diesel loco shed.\n\n== Sub-classes ==\n\n=== WDM-2A ===\nThe '''WDM-2A''' is a variant of the original WDM-2. These units have been retro-fitted with [[air brake (rail)|air brake]]s, in addition to the original [[vacuum brake]]s.So these locos have dual braking capacity.Despite this some WDM-2A are still marked as WDM-2 only\n\n=== WDM-2B ===\nThe '''WDM-2B''' is a more recent locomotive, built with air brakes as original equipment. They do not have Vacuum brakes. Only some have been classified as WDM-2B.\n\n=== Jumbos ===\n[[File:WDM-2 Diesel loco of PUNE.jpg|thumb|Jumbo variant of the WDM-2|287x287px]]\nThe WDM-2 locos from serial numbers around 17788 to 17890<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/3461?authenticity_token=1f1Qxu9tgr7S3q+aySo3YvzVrC0l6leDud+8JTLwvRk=&loco_class_id=11&page=17|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways Locomotive Roster Shakurbasti (SSB) WDM-2 17890 Show|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>  to were fitted with full-width short hood with intention of giving them an extended visibility for the drivers.

But these locos proved to be not that useful as the loco pilots raised their concerns that they had to stand up to operate them. So a few were modified to have normal short hoods of WDM-2.Some earlier Jumbos were also converted to WDM-3A.\n\nThese locomotives are easy recognizable by short hood with big windows. After Over-ageing of these locomotives, the jumbos were mainly used on Shunting or Departmental works trains. As a consequence few of them are still in service\n\n=== WDM-2S ===\nThis classification are given to WDM-2 which are nearing the end of their service/Codal life. These locos can be easily recognized by '0' at the beginning of their road number. These WDM-2 locos are relegated to do Shunting or occasionally haul Departmental works trains.Some WDM-2 remain in classification for many years before they are scrapped.  \n\n== Variants ==\n\n=== [[Indian locomotive class WDM-3A|WDM-3A]] ===\n{{Main|Indian locomotive class WDM-3A}}\nExcept for some 150 units The WDM-3A class are actually upgraded WDM-2 designed to produce more power and since hauling more loads.

A total of 2700+ WDM-2 were built at ALCO and [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] (DLW), Varanasi between 1962 and 1998, which made them the most numerous class of mainline diesel locomotive till its successor the [[Indian locomotive class WDM-3A|WDM-3A.]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-specs.html|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways FAQ: Diesel and Electric Locomotive Specifications|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>\n\nThe WDM-2 is one of the most successful locomotives serving both passenger and freight trains for over 58 years. Despite the introduction of more modern types of locomotives like [[Indian locomotive class WDG-4|WDG-4]] and electrification, a significant number are still in use, both on mainline and departmental duties. As of January 2020, 30 locomotives still exist as WDM-2, with further examples having been converted to [[Indian locomotive class WDM-3A|WDM-3A]] or WDM-2S. 30 retain \"operational status\" on the mainline.\n\n== Orgins ==\nThe WDM-2 history begins in the early 1960s with the stated aim of the [[Indian Railways]] to remove [[steam locomotive]]s from Indian Rails. It therefore required a large build of [[Co-Co locomotives|Co-Co]] diesel locomotives with [[road switcher]] cabs to achieve this aim. This required locomotives producing at least 2,600&nbsp;hp (1,900&nbsp;kW) and began looking at various [[Diesel-electric train|diesel-electric]] designs.\n\nInitially, the Indian railways invited tenders to build locomotives to the new specification.The following responses were received:\n\n* ALCO submitted their model(RSD29 / DL560C) with 2600&nbsp;hp, 16-cylinder, 4-stroke turbo-supercharged engine with Co-Co bogies.\n* [[Electro-Motive Diesel|General Motors Electro-Motive Division]] (EMD) submitted their [[EMD SD24|SD24]], given model number GT16 for the India export version. They had Co-Co bogies with 16-cylinder 2-stroke turbo-supercharged engines.\n\nEach company submitted prototypes and Indian Railways designated these prototypes as the WDM-2 class and [[Indian locomotive class WDM-4|WDM-4]] class respectively. Technologically the General Motors WDM-4 was superior to ALCO's WDM-2, but Indian Railways required a transfer of technology agreement that would allow these locomotives to be manufactured in India. General Motors did not agree to the transfer of technology agreement so the ALCo prototype was selected for production.\n\nHowever, even before the arrival of WDM-2 another type of diesel locomotive was imported from ALCo beginning in 1957. This locomotive was classified as [[Indian locomotive class WDM-1|WDM-1]].However WDM-1s were not selected for mass production because of having only one forward cab at one end which needed a lot of turntables. \n\n== Production History ==\nThe first few prototype WDM-2 were imported with #18040 being the first WDM-2 of India. The need for a large number of locomotives quickly was deemed paramount. After [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] (DLW) completed construction of its factory in Varanasi, production of the locomotives began in India.The first 12 locos were built using kits imported from ALCO(order no. D3389) in the United States. The first diesel loco assembled in DLW being #18233 and the first fully-built WDM-2 from DLW was 18299. After that DLW started manufacturing the WDM-2 locomotives from their own components. Since then over 2,800 locomotives have been manufactured and the WDM-2 has become the most popular locomotive in India with the very last one being #16887.\n\nWhile ALCO went bankrupt, DLW varanasi successfully adapted the technology and produced may upgraded versions which were exported to many BG countries. Later a number of modifications were made and a few subclasses were created. This includes WDM-2A, WDM-2B and WDM-3A (formerly WDM-2C). Now a few WDM-2 locos are being rebuilt by Diesel Loco Modernization Works (DLMW) Patiala, Punjab. These are fitted with Daulat Ram DBR's.\n\n== Service History ==\nBy 1967 the first trains were being migrated to diesel and the initial high speed foray was the [[Mumbai Rajdhani Express|Mumbai Rajdhani]] with the WDM2. The other trains dieselised were the premier mails and expresses where the WDM2 ( and  to a lesser and localised extent,the WDM4)  hauled an augmented load of 17 coaches and shaved off 4 to 5 hours over a 1500 km run particularly in systems where WP speeds were lower than other double-line systems like ER,CR and WR.\n\nSome of the trains were end to end WDM2 like the [[Himgiri Superfast Express|Himgiri]] and [[Tamil Nadu Express|Tamil Nadu]] but some were electric hauled for the part run. All averaged speeds well over 65 kmph. Some had the benefit of double line traction  but the Himgiri was running on large single line stretches  and the Tamil Nadu managed over 70 kmph.The WDM-2 locos have a maximum speed of {{convert|120|km/h|abbr=on}},<ref name=\"interactive\">{{cite web|url=http://www.irfca.org/docs/wdm2-interactive.html|title=Interactive Diagram of the WDM-2 Locomotive|author=Sheeju Chandran|date=|work=|publisher=Indian Railways Fan Club|accessdate=April 2, 2010}}</ref> restricted to {{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on}} when run long hood forward - the gear ratio is 65:18.\n\n== Sub-classes ==\n\n=== WDM-2A ===\nThe '''WDM-2A''' is a variant of the original WDM-2.

But these locos proved to be not that useful as the loco pilots raised their concerns that they had to stand up to operate them. So a few were modified to have normal short hoods of WDM-2.Some earlier Jumbos were also converted to WDM-3A.\n\nThese locomotives are easy recognizable by short hood with big windows. After Over-ageing of these locomotives, the jumbos were mainly used on Shunting or Departmental works trains.

The Conners celebrate an outrageous Halloween that becomes an annual feature of the series.

DJ plays a bigger role this season, most notably in an episode wherein he refuses to kiss a black girl in his school play.<ref>{{Cite news |title = Roseanne \u2013 The Complete Seventh Season |work = DVD Talk |url = https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/27621/roseanne-the-complete-seventh-season/ |accessdate = August 16, 2010 }}</ref> Episode 19 is a special 45-minute show that recounts all the previous seasons with Roseanne being \"welcomed\" by other sitcom moms.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nNotable guest stars during the season include [[Sharon Stone]] as a trailer-park resident, [[Ellen DeGeneres]] as Jackie and Fred's psychologist, [[Danny Masterson]] as Darlene's boyfriend Jimmy, and [[Traci Lords]] as Lanford Lunch Box busperson Stacy. In the season finale, a tribute is made to [[Sherwood Schwartz]]. Uncredited appearances at the end of the episode have ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'' cast members playing Roseanne characters. These include [[Dawn Wells]], [[Bob Denver]], [[Tina Louise]], and [[Russell Johnson]], as well as Sherwood Schwartz. Also, [[Isabel Sanford]], [[Alley Mills]], [[Barbara Billingsley]], [[June Lockhart]], and [[Pat Crowley]] appear as themselves in another episode.\n\n=== Season 8 ===\nSeason eight addresses Roseanne's baby shower and the subsequent arrival of her son, [[Jerry Garcia]] Conner. (In a [[Continuity (fiction)#Continuity errors|continuity]] error, the baby had been revealed to be a girl in season seven. Roseanne, in an after-credits out of character scene, explains that after she fell pregnant she wished the Conners' baby to be the same gender as hers). The season starts when Dan decides to leave the security of his city job to help build the new prison being constructed outside of Lanford. With the pension, final check, and retirement money he receives for leaving his job he decides to give his family the vacation they never had and takes everyone, including Mark, David, and Roseanne's mother, along to [[Walt Disney World]].\n\nIt is later revealed that one of the nights the clan was at Disney World, Darlene got pregnant. Darlene quickly decides she and David want to have the baby and the two get engaged. The season climaxes with a very rushed wedding for the couple. Immediately after the ceremony, realizing how much has been changing, Dan suffers a heart attack. In the next episode, it is revealed that he survived, with DJ saving his life. The season concludes with Dan and Roseanne having a bitter fight after Dan refuses to stick to his diet and exercise plan, rehashing many of the buried personality clashes of the entire series. They end up wrecking their living room in the process. The credits fade as Roseanne walks out on Dan.<ref>{{Cite news |title = Roseanne: Season Eight |work = DVD Talk |url = https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/29559/roseanne-season-eight |accessdate = August 16, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nNotable guest stars during the season include [[Fred Willard]] as Leon's husband Scott, [[Ed McMahon]] as himself, [[John Popper]] (with [[Blues Traveler]]) as an old friend of Dan's, [[Pat Harrington Jr.]] as himself, [[Jenna Elfman]] as hitchhiker Garland, [[Shecky Greene]] as Bar Mitzvah guest Uncle Saul, [[Norm Crosby]] as Reverend Crosley, [[June Lockhart]] as Leon's mother, [[Milton Berle]] as a transvestite, the cast of [[Stomp (theatrical show)|Stomp]] as Lanford Lunch Box patrons, [[Eric Dane]] as a Disney World bellhop, and [[Tony Curtis]] as ballroom-dance instructor Hal.\n\n=== Season 9 ===\nThe opening titles of Season 9 still say the show stars \"Roseanne\", but the first episode credits her as \"Roseanne Barr Pentland Arnold Thomas\".\n\nThe ninth (and originally final) season features many changes. In previous seasons, the original theme song was played on [[saxophone]], accompanied by drums and other instruments. For this final season, the theme was re-recorded and performed by [[Blues Traveler]] with a distorted harmonica\u2014one of the band's staples\u2014playing in place of the saxophone. Lyrics were also added and sung into the theme by the band's lead vocalist, [[John Popper]]. Episodes in this season exhibit a much more surreal style. Additionally, the 'daily struggle' theme of previous episodes is abandoned, and the season focuses primarily on bringing the characters full circle emotionally.\n\nThe Conners win the state [[lottery]] jackpot of $108 million; Dan ponders the meaning of life, Jackie meets her prince, DJ finds love, and Darlene, after some trouble, gives birth. John Goodman is absent for most of the season, as he was busy filming ''[[The Big Lebowski]]''; in later episodes, Goodman resembles his \"Lebowski\" character Walter Sobchak.\n\nIn the season's final episode, Roseanne reveals the entire series itself is actually a story written by Roseanne Conner about her life. To cope, Roseanne twisted major elements of her life for the story, which the audience does not discover until the final moments of the season. In reality, Dan's heart attack near the end of Season 8 was fatal and the Conner family did not win the lottery. A story arc running through the final season, that Dan betrayed Roseanne by having an affair, is revealed to be false. We learn that Dan's betrayal wasn't having an affair, but dying.\n\nRoseanne could always take the worst life could throw at her with a laugh, but she could not handle Dan's death. Also, Jackie is a lesbian and Beverly is straight. Scott is a probate lawyer whom Roseanne befriended, and set up with Leon\u2014who she claims isn't very hip the way she had written him to be; this seems a tad tongue in cheek.<ref>{{Cite news |title = Roseanne: The Complete Ninth Season |work = DVD Talk |url = https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/31275/roseanne-the-complete-ninth-season |accessdate = August 16, 2010 }}</ref> Becky is dating David and Darlene is with Mark.\n\nGuest stars during the season include [[Edward Asner]] as [[Lou Grant]], [[Heather Matarazzo]] as D.J.\u2019s girlfriend, Dann Florek as Doctor Rudmen, [[Jim Varney]] as Jackie's boyfriend Prince Carlos, [[Tammy Faye Messner|Tammy Faye Bakker]] as Roseanne's makeup consultant, [[Dina Merrill]] as Doris, [[Joanna Lumley]] as [[Absolutely Fabulous|Patsy Stone]] and [[Jennifer Saunders]] as [[Absolutely Fabulous|Edina Monsoon]] (reprising their roles from ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]''), [[Arianna Huffington]] as Estree, [[Marlo Thomas]] as Tina, [[James Brolin]] as Roseanne's business partner/love interest Edgar Wellman, Jr., and [[Ann Wedgeworth]] and [[Debbie Reynolds]] as Dan's mother Audrey, as well as [[Hugh Hefner]], [[Milton Berle]], [[Robin Leach]], [[Todd Oldham]], [[Moon Unit]] and [[Ahmet Zappa]], [[Tony Robbins]], [[Kathleen Sullivan (journalist)|Kathleen Sullivan]], [[Steven Seagal]], and [[Jerry Springer]] as themselves.\n\n== Revival ==\nDuring the show's final season, Barr was in negotiations with [[Carsey-Werner Productions]] and ABC executives to continue playing Roseanne Conner in a spin-off.<ref>{{cite news|author=Bill Carter|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500E0DE123DF937A35757C0A961958260 |title = Roseanne to Continue on TV But Is Expected to Leave ABC |newspaper = New York Times|date=April 4, 1997|accessdate=February 18, 2011 }}</ref> However, ABC withdrew from negotiations with Carsey-Werner and Barr after failed discussions with CBS and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]].

Jackie has a brief relationship with Booker ([[George Clooney]]), the foreman at Wellman. Dan ([[John Goodman]]) finds sporadic work as a construction contractor and faces a strained relationship with his irresponsible and womanizing father ([[Ned Beatty]]). Roseanne's parents, Beverly ([[Estelle Parsons]]) and Al ([[John Randolph (actor)|John Randolph]]), consider moving to Lanford, but eventually decide against it.\n\nTomboy Darlene ([[Sara Gilbert]]) struggles with her femininity as she enters puberty and gets her first period. Becky ([[Lecy Goranson]]) faces dating problems with her first boyfriend Chip ([[Jared Rushton]]), who is introduced in the \"Lover's Lane\" episode. Season one also finds the Conners experiencing, and surviving, a tornado. In the \"Death and Stuff\" episode a door-to-door salesman dies in the Conners' kitchen, and in the season finale, Roseanne stands up to a new foreman ([[Fred Thompson]]), when she leads Jackie, Crystal, and other coworkers as they quit Wellman Plastics. DJ is played by Sal Barone in the pilot episode and by [[Michael Fishman]] for the remainder of the series.

Jackie applies to be a police officer. Roseanne cycles through a variety of menial jobs including telemarketer, secretary for Dan's boss, bartender, cashier at a fast-food restaurant, and, finally, sweeping floors at a beauty parlor. At home, Dan's poker buddy Arnie ([[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]]) makes a startling debut when he plants a kiss on Roseanne. The Conners celebrate an outrageous Halloween that becomes an annual feature of the series. Roseanne wants 10 minutes to herself in the bathroom; this turns into a bizarre dream sequence which has the entire cast singing parodies of songs from musical comedies. Later, at [[Thanksgiving]] dinner, Dan notices of a growing romance between his father and Crystal. Jackie gets serious with new boyfriend, Gary ([[Brian Kerwin]]). Becky grows rebellious against Roseanne and Dan's parental authority, staying out late and breaking into the liquor cabinet and getting drunk with her friend, Dana, when Dan and Roseanne leave town for the day. The reappearance of old biker buddy, Ziggy ([[Jay O. Sanders]]), reminds Roseanne and Dan of their own rebellious past. Darlene shows writing talent when she wins recognition for her poem. Roseanne's own writing talents are given a boost when Dan builds a room in the basement to serve as a writer's den.

Roseanne takes on a waitress job in the luncheonette at Rodbell's Department Store, where she meets her boss, Leon ([[Martin Mull]]) and co-worker, Bonnie ([[Bonnie Bramlett|Bonnie Sheridan]]). Jackie gets injured on the job, which results in her leaving the police force and breaking up with Gary. Becky begins dating Mark Healy ([[Glenn Quinn]]); when her parents forbid her to see him, she temporarily moves in with Jackie. Dan is floored to learn his father Ed and Crystal plan to marry; Crystal is pregnant with Ed's baby.\n\nRoseanne locks horns with snooty new neighbor Kathy ([[Meagen Fay]]). Bev's mother, Nana Mary ([[Shelley Winters]]) makes her first appearance at a family barbecue. In the season finale, Ziggy reappears, proposing to open a motorcycle repair shop with Dan and Roseanne. While they attempt to procure a loan for business, Ziggy backs out and leaves town, not wanting Dan and Roseanne to risk their house if the business fails. However, he leaves enough money behind for Dan to open it by himself.

Dan and Roseanne begin their new motorcycle repair shop business, Lanford Custom Cycle, while Roseanne continues working at Rodbell's luncheonette. Darlene meets David Healy ([[Johnny Galecki]]), Mark's younger brother (in his first appearance, the character named Kevin). After a brief stint working at Rodbell's perfume counter, Jackie decides to become a truck driver. Nancy ([[Sandra Bernhard]]) is introduced as Arnie's fianc\u00e9e. After a night of heavy drinking, Jackie discovers she slept with the newly engaged Arnie. Darlene's personality shifts into a sullen [[Goth subculture|goth]] teen. Jackie's former boyfriend, Booker, makes a surprise appearance at a Halloween party. Roseanne's neighbors, Kathy and Jerry Bowman, move back to Chicago. Roseanne gets [[breast reduction]] surgery. Crystal gives birth to Dan's new half-brother, \"Little Ed\". Roseanne and Dan accompany Arnie and Nancy to their wedding in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]].

Becky secretly decides to go with him, and they elope. Jackie and Roseanne each receive $10,000 from their mother after she divorces their father. They, along with Nancy, decide to open a diner but can only get the additional money they need from Bev, who becomes a partner. Nancy comes out as a lesbian. The Tildens, a single father and his two teen daughters ([[Wings Hauser]], [[Mara Hobel]], [[Danielle Harris]]), move in next door. Jackie dates Fisher ([[Matt Roth (actor)|Matt Roth]]), a much younger man. When Roseanne discovers Fisher physically abused Jackie, Dan beats him up (never shown onscreen) and is arrested. Roseanne and Jackie's father dies, and Roseanne confronts his longtime secret mistress only to discover her father blamed his daughters for his abusive behavior. Roseanne's rich, estranged cousin Ronnie ([[Joan Collins]]) visits and persuades Darlene to get her [[General Educational Development|GED]] and apply to an arts school. David applies as well. Darlene asks her parents if David can move in when his mother is moving away. Roseanne and Dan initially refuse, but when Roseanne witnesses David's mother being verbally and emotionally abusive to him, she decides to let him stay, a decision partially made due to her own father's abusiveness. Roger (Tim Curry) offers Dan a business deal to renovate and sell a small [[fixer-upper]] house, then skips town, leaving Dan with a looming debt; Jackie buys the house, saving the Conners from financial ruin. David is rejected from the arts school in Chicago he and Darlene applied to, while Darlene is accepted. Roseanne refuses to let Darlene go before finishing high school. She fears Darlene might run away to Chicago, but Darlene has already decided not to go to the school because David was rejected.

David proposes marriage to Darlene, but she refuses. Dan and Roseanne discover an old marijuana stash in the basement and smoke it in their bathroom. Roseanne's past as an abuse victim arises when she reacts violently to DJ after he [[Joyride (crime)|joyrides]] and wrecks her car, leaving her concerned she may be continuing the cycle. Becky (now played by [[Sarah Chalke]]) and Mark return home and move into the Conners' house. Mark goes to trade school but soon drops out.

All credits (Opening and closing) included the cast and crew's first names only. This was the only time this occurred in an episode during its run.\n\nSeason seven begins with Roseanne's pregnancy and goes on to tackle such issues as abortion, alcoholism, drug abuse, sexual dysfunction, and racial prejudice. Darlene and David break up after briefly maintaining an open relationship, leading to some awkwardness for Roseanne and Dan as they try to deal living with their daughter's ex-boyfriend. David and Darlene both date other people, but eventually, they reunite. Due to tension in the household, Mark and Becky move into a trailer. DJ plays a bigger role this season, most notably in an episode wherein he refuses to kiss a black girl in his school play.<ref>{{Cite news |title = Roseanne \u2013 The Complete Seventh Season |work = DVD Talk |url = https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/27621/roseanne-the-complete-seventh-season/ |accessdate = August 16, 2010 }}</ref> Episode 19 is a special 45-minute show that recounts all the previous seasons with Roseanne being \"welcomed\" by other sitcom moms.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nNotable guest stars during the season include [[Sharon Stone]] as a trailer-park resident, [[Ellen DeGeneres]] as Jackie and Fred's psychologist, [[Danny Masterson]] as Darlene's boyfriend Jimmy, and [[Traci Lords]] as Lanford Lunch Box busperson Stacy. In the season finale, a tribute is made to [[Sherwood Schwartz]]. Uncredited appearances at the end of the episode have ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'' cast members playing Roseanne characters. These include [[Dawn Wells]], [[Bob Denver]], [[Tina Louise]], and [[Russell Johnson]], as well as Sherwood Schwartz. Also, [[Isabel Sanford]], [[Alley Mills]], [[Barbara Billingsley]], [[June Lockhart]], and [[Pat Crowley]] appear as themselves in another episode.\n\n=== Season 8 ===\nSeason eight addresses Roseanne's baby shower and the subsequent arrival of her son, [[Jerry Garcia]] Conner. (In a [[Continuity (fiction)#Continuity errors|continuity]] error, the baby had been revealed to be a girl in season seven. Roseanne, in an after-credits out of character scene, explains that after she fell pregnant she wished the Conners' baby to be the same gender as hers). The season starts when Dan decides to leave the security of his city job to help build the new prison being constructed outside of Lanford. With the pension, final check, and retirement money he receives for leaving his job he decides to give his family the vacation they never had and takes everyone, including Mark, David, and Roseanne's mother, along to [[Walt Disney World]].\n\nIt is later revealed that one of the nights the clan was at Disney World, Darlene got pregnant. Darlene quickly decides she and David want to have the baby and the two get engaged. The season climaxes with a very rushed wedding for the couple. Immediately after the ceremony, realizing how much has been changing, Dan suffers a heart attack. In the next episode, it is revealed that he survived, with DJ saving his life. The season concludes with Dan and Roseanne having a bitter fight after Dan refuses to stick to his diet and exercise plan, rehashing many of the buried personality clashes of the entire series. They end up wrecking their living room in the process. The credits fade as Roseanne walks out on Dan.<ref>{{Cite news |title = Roseanne: Season Eight |work = DVD Talk |url = https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/29559/roseanne-season-eight |accessdate = August 16, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nNotable guest stars during the season include [[Fred Willard]] as Leon's husband Scott, [[Ed McMahon]] as himself, [[John Popper]] (with [[Blues Traveler]]) as an old friend of Dan's, [[Pat Harrington Jr.]] as himself, [[Jenna Elfman]] as hitchhiker Garland, [[Shecky Greene]] as Bar Mitzvah guest Uncle Saul, [[Norm Crosby]] as Reverend Crosley, [[June Lockhart]] as Leon's mother, [[Milton Berle]] as a transvestite, the cast of [[Stomp (theatrical show)|Stomp]] as Lanford Lunch Box patrons, [[Eric Dane]] as a Disney World bellhop, and [[Tony Curtis]] as ballroom-dance instructor Hal.\n\n=== Season 9 ===\nThe opening titles of Season 9 still say the show stars \"Roseanne\", but the first episode credits her as \"Roseanne Barr Pentland Arnold Thomas\".\n\nThe ninth (and originally final) season features many changes. In previous seasons, the original theme song was played on [[saxophone]], accompanied by drums and other instruments. For this final season, the theme was re-recorded and performed by [[Blues Traveler]] with a distorted harmonica\u2014one of the band's staples\u2014playing in place of the saxophone. Lyrics were also added and sung into the theme by the band's lead vocalist, [[John Popper]]. Episodes in this season exhibit a much more surreal style. Additionally, the 'daily struggle' theme of previous episodes is abandoned, and the season focuses primarily on bringing the characters full circle emotionally.\n\nThe Conners win the state [[lottery]] jackpot of $108 million; Dan ponders the meaning of life, Jackie meets her prince, DJ finds love, and Darlene, after some trouble, gives birth. John Goodman is absent for most of the season, as he was busy filming ''[[The Big Lebowski]]''; in later episodes, Goodman resembles his \"Lebowski\" character Walter Sobchak.\n\nIn the season's final episode, Roseanne reveals the entire series itself is actually a story written by Roseanne Conner about her life. To cope, Roseanne twisted major elements of her life for the story, which the audience does not discover until the final moments of the season. In reality, Dan's heart attack near the end of Season 8 was fatal and the Conner family did not win the lottery. A story arc running through the final season, that Dan betrayed Roseanne by having an affair, is revealed to be false. We learn that Dan's betrayal wasn't having an affair, but dying.\n\nRoseanne could always take the worst life could throw at her with a laugh, but she could not handle Dan's death. Also, Jackie is a lesbian and Beverly is straight. Scott is a probate lawyer whom Roseanne befriended, and set up with Leon\u2014who she claims isn't very hip the way she had written him to be; this seems a tad tongue in cheek.<ref>{{Cite news |title = Roseanne: The Complete Ninth Season |work = DVD Talk |url = https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/31275/roseanne-the-complete-ninth-season |accessdate = August 16, 2010 }}</ref> Becky is dating David and Darlene is with Mark.\n\nGuest stars during the season include [[Edward Asner]] as [[Lou Grant]], [[Heather Matarazzo]] as D.J.\u2019s girlfriend, Dann Florek as Doctor Rudmen, [[Jim Varney]] as Jackie's boyfriend Prince Carlos, [[Tammy Faye Messner|Tammy Faye Bakker]] as Roseanne's makeup consultant, [[Dina Merrill]] as Doris, [[Joanna Lumley]] as [[Absolutely Fabulous|Patsy Stone]] and [[Jennifer Saunders]] as [[Absolutely Fabulous|Edina Monsoon]] (reprising their roles from ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]''), [[Arianna Huffington]] as Estree, [[Marlo Thomas]] as Tina, [[James Brolin]] as Roseanne's business partner/love interest Edgar Wellman, Jr., and [[Ann Wedgeworth]] and [[Debbie Reynolds]] as Dan's mother Audrey, as well as [[Hugh Hefner]], [[Milton Berle]], [[Robin Leach]], [[Todd Oldham]], [[Moon Unit]] and [[Ahmet Zappa]], [[Tony Robbins]], [[Kathleen Sullivan (journalist)|Kathleen Sullivan]], [[Steven Seagal]], and [[Jerry Springer]] as themselves.\n\n== Revival ==\nDuring the show's final season, Barr was in negotiations with [[Carsey-Werner Productions]] and ABC executives to continue playing Roseanne Conner in a spin-off.<ref>{{cite news|author=Bill Carter|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500E0DE123DF937A35757C0A961958260 |title = Roseanne to Continue on TV But Is Expected to Leave ABC |newspaper = New York Times|date=April 4, 1997|accessdate=February 18, 2011 }}</ref> However, ABC withdrew from negotiations with Carsey-Werner and Barr after failed discussions with CBS and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]].
