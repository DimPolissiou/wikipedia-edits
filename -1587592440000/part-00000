It was the reverse of an ordinary question mark, so that instead of the main opening pointing back into the sentence, it opened away from it.<ref>Truss (2004), p. 142.</ref> This character can be represented using the reversed question mark ([[\u2e2e]]) found in Unicode as U+2E2E. The percontation point is analogous to the [[irony mark]], but those are even more rarely seen.\n\nBracketed question marks can be used for rhetorical questions, for example ''Oh, really(?)'', in informal contexts such as [[closed captioning]].  For an ironic or sarcastic statement, a bracketed exclamation mark may be used: ''Oh, really(!)''.\n\nThe question mark can also be used as a [[meta]]-sign to signal uncertainty regarding what precedes it. It is usually put between brackets: ''(?)''. The uncertainty may concern either a superficial level (such as unsure spelling), or a deeper [[Truth-conditional semantics|truth]] (real [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]]).\n\n==Computing==\nIn [[computing]], the question mark [[Character (computing)|character]] is represented by [[ASCII]] code 63 (0x3F hexadecimal), and is located at Unicode code-point {{unichar|003F|QUESTION MARK|html=}}. The full-width (double-byte) equivalent ('''\uff1f'''), is located at code-point {{unichar|FF1F|FULLWIDTH QUESTION MARK|html=}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Character Codes \u2013 HTML Codes, Hexadecimal Codes & HTML Names |url=http://www.character-code.com/ |work=Character-Code.com |access-date=August 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe question mark is often utilized as a [[wildcard character]]: a symbol that can be used to substitute for any other character or characters in a [[String (computer science)|string]]. In particular \"?\" is used as a substitute for any one character as opposed to the [[asterisk]], \"*\", which can be used as a substitute for zero or more characters in a string. The [[Inverted question mark and exclamation point|inverted question mark]] ('''\u00bf''') corresponds to Unicode code-point {{unichar|00BF|INVERTED QUESTION MARK|html=}}, and can be accessed from the keyboard in [[Microsoft Windows]] on the default US layout by holding down the [[Alt key|<kbd>Alt</kbd>]] and typing either <kbd>1 6 8</kbd> (ANSI) or <kbd>0 1 9 1</kbd> (Unicode) on the numeric keypad. In [[GNOME]] applications on [[Linux]] operating systems, it can be entered by typing the hexadecimal Unicode character (minus leading zeros) while holding down both [[Ctrl key|<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>]] and [[Shift key|<kbd>Shift</kbd>]], I J mm.e.: <kbd>Ctrl Shift B F</kbd>. In recent [[XFree86]] and [[X.Org Server|X.Org]] incarnations of the [[X Window System]], it can be accessed as a compose sequence of two straight question marks, i.e. pressing [[Compose key|<kbd>Compose</kbd>]]<kbd> ? ?</kbd> yields <samp>\u00bf</samp>. In [[classic Mac OS]] and [[Mac OS X]] (macOS), the key combination [[Option key|<kbd>Option</kbd>]]<kbd> Shift ?</kbd> produces an inverted question mark.\n\nThe question mark is used in ASCII renderings of the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], such as [[SAMPA]], in place of the [[glottal stop]] symbol, {{IPA|'''\u0294'''}}, (which resembles \"'''?'''\" without the dot), and corresponds to Unicode code point {{unichar|0294|LATIN LETTER GLOTTAL STOP|html=}}.\n\nIn [[computer programming]], the symbol \"'''?'''\" has a special meaning in many [[programming language]]s. In [[C (programming language)|C]]-descended languages, <code>?</code> is part of the [[?:|<code>?:</code>]] operator, which is used to evaluate simple [[Boolean domain|boolean conditions]]. In [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] 2.0, the <code>?</code> modifier is used to handle [[Nullable type|nullable data types]] and <code>??</code> is the [[null coalescing operator]]. In the [[POSIX]] syntax for [[regular expression]]s, such as that used in [[Perl]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]], <code>?</code> stands for \"zero or one instance of the previous subexpression\", i.e. an optional element. In certain implementations of the [[BASIC]] programming language, the <code>?</code> character may be used as a shorthand for the \"print\" function; in others (notably the [[BBC BASIC]] family), <code>?</code> is used to address a single-byte memory location. In [[OCaml]], the question mark precedes the label for an optional parameter. In [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]], as a convention, symbol names ending in <code>?</code> are used for predicates, such as <code>odd?</code>, <code>null?</code>, and <code>eq?</code>. Similarly, in [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], method names ending in <code>?</code> are used for predicates. In [[Swift (programming language)|Swift]], a type followed by <code>?</code> denotes an [[option type]]; <code>?</code> is also used in \"optional chaining\", where if an option value is nil, it ignores the following operations. In [[APL (programming language)|APL]], <code>?</code> generates random numbers or a random subset of indices. In [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]], a <code>?</code> suffix on a function or method call indicates error handling.\n\nIn many [[Web browser]]s and other computer programs, when converting text between encodings, it may not be possible to map some characters into the target [[character set]]. In this situation it is common to replace each unmappable character with a question mark <samp>?</samp>, inverted question mark <samp>\u00bf</samp>, or the Unicode [[replacement character]], usually rendered as a white question mark in a black diamond: {{unichar|FFFD|REPLACEMENT CHARACTER}}. This commonly occurs for apostrophes and quotation marks when they are written with software that uses its own proprietary non-standard code for these characters, such as [[Microsoft Office]]'s [[Quotation marks in English#Smart quotes|\"smart quotes\"]].\n\nThe generic [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] syntax allows for a [[query string]] to be appended to a resource location in a Web address so that additional information can be passed to a script; the query mark, <code>?</code>, is used to indicate the start of a query string. A query string is usually made up of a number of different field/value pairs, each separated by the [[ampersand]] symbol, <code>&</code>, as seen in this URL:\n\n<code><nowiki>http://www.example.com/search.php?query=testing&database=English</nowiki></code>\n\nHere, a script on the page <samp>search.php</samp> on the server <samp>www.example.com</samp> is to provide a response to the query string containing the pairs <samp>query=</samp><kbd>testing</kbd> and <samp>database=</samp><kbd>English</kbd>.\n\n==Games==\nIn [[algebraic chess notation]], some [[chess punctuation]] conventions include: \"'''?'''\" denotes a bad move, \"'''??'''\" a [[blunder (chess)|blunder]], \"'''?!'''\" a [[dubious]] move, and \"'''!?'''\" an interesting move.\n\nIn [[Scrabble]], a question mark indicates a blank tile.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.tucsonscrabble.com/articles/glossary.html |title=Scrabble Glossary |publisher=Tucson Scrabble Club |access-date=February 6, 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Mathematics and formal logic==\n{{anchor|Mathematics|reason=Original section name.}}\nIn [[mathematics]], \"'''?'''\" commonly denotes [[Minkowski's question mark function]]. In equations, it can mean \"questioned\" as opposed to \"defined\".\n\n*{{unichar|225F|QUESTIONED EQUAL TO}}\n*{{unichar|2A7B|LESS-THAN WITH QUESTION MARK ABOVE}}\n*{{unichar|2A7C|GREATER-THAN WITH QUESTION MARK ABOVE}}\n\nIn [[linear logic]], the question mark denotes one of the exponential modalities that control weakening and contraction.\n\n==Medicine==\nA question mark is used in English medical notes to suggest a possible [[diagnosis]]. It facilitates the recording of a doctor's impressions regarding a patient's symptoms and signs. For example, for a patient presenting with left [[lower abdominal pain]], a differential diagnosis might include ''?[[diverticulitis]]'' (read as \"query diverticulitis\").\n\n==See also==\n* [[Exclamation mark]]\n* [[Interrobang]]\n* [[Irony mark]]\n* [[Terminal punctuation]]\n* [[Inquiry]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Lupton |first1=Ellen |last2=Miller |first2=J.

It was the reverse of an ordinary question mark, so that instead of the main opening pointing back into the sentence, it opened away from it.<ref>Truss (2004), p. 142.</ref> This character can be represented using the reversed question mark ([[\u2e2e]]) found in Unicode as U+2E2E. The percontation point is analogous to the [[irony mark]], but those are even more rarely seen.\n\nBracketed question marks can be used for rhetorical questions, for example ''Oh, really(?)'', in informal contexts such as [[closed captioning]].  For an ironic or sarcastic statement, a bracketed exclamation mark may be used: ''Oh, really(!)''.\n\nThe question mark can also be used as a [[meta]]-sign to signal uncertainty regarding what precedes it. It is usually put between brackets: ''(?)''. The uncertainty may concern either a superficial level (such as unsure spelling), or a deeper [[Truth-conditional semantics|truth]] (real [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]]).\n\n==Computing==\nIn [[computing]], the question mark [[Character (computing)|character]] is represented by [[ASCII]] code 63 (0x3F hexadecimal), and is located at Unicode code-point {{unichar|003F|QUESTION MARK|html=}}. The full-width (double-byte) equivalent ('''\uff1f'''), is located at code-point {{unichar|FF1F|FULLWIDTH QUESTION MARK|html=}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Character Codes \u2013 HTML Codes, Hexadecimal Codes & HTML Names |url=http://www.character-code.com/ |work=Character-Code.com |access-date=August 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe question mark is often utilized as a [[wildcard character]]: a symbol that can be used to substitute for any other character or characters in a [[String (computer science)|string]]. In particular \"?\" is used as a substitute for any one character as opposed to the [[asterisk]], \"*\", which can be used as a substitute for zero or more characters in a string. The [[Inverted question mark and exclamation point|inverted question mark]] ('''\u00bf''') corresponds to Unicode code-point {{unichar|00BF|INVERTED QUESTION MARK|html=}}, and can be accessed from the keyboard in [[Microsoft Windows]] on the default US layout by holding down the [[Alt key|<kbd>Alt</kbd>]] and typing either <kbd>1 6 8</kbd> (ANSI) or <kbd>0 1 9 1</kbd> (Unicode) on the numeric keypad. In [[GNOME]] applications on [[Linux]] operating systems, it can be entered by typing the hexadecimal Unicode character (minus leading zeros) while holding down both [[Ctrl key|<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>]] and [[Shift key|<kbd>Shift</kbd>]], I J mm.e.: <kbd>Ctrl Shift B F</kbd>. In recent [[XFree86]] and [[X.Org Server|X.Org]] incarnations of the [[X Window System]], it can be accessed as a compose sequence of two straight question marks, i.e. pressing [[Compose key|<kbd>Compose</kbd>]]<kbd> ? ?</kbd> yields <samp>\u00bf</samp>. In [[classic Mac OS]] and [[Mac OS X]] (macOS), the key combination [[Option key|<kbd>Option</kbd>]]<kbd> Shift ?</kbd> produces an inverted question mark.\n\nThe question mark is used in ASCII renderings of the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], such as [[SAMPA]], in place of the [[glottal stop]] symbol, {{IPA|'''\u0294'''}}, (which resembles \"'''?'''\" without the dot), and corresponds to Unicode code point {{unichar|0294|LATIN LETTER GLOTTAL STOP|html=}}.\n\nIn [[computer programming]], the symbol \"'''?'''\" has a special meaning in many [[programming language]]s. In [[C (programming language)|C]]-descended languages, <code>?</code> is part of the [[?:|<code>?:</code>]] operator, which is used to evaluate simple [[Boolean domain|boolean conditions]]. In [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] 2.0, the <code>?</code> modifier is used to handle [[Nullable type|nullable data types]] and <code>??</code> is the [[null coalescing operator]]. In the [[POSIX]] syntax for [[regular expression]]s, such as that used in [[Perl]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]], <code>?</code> stands for \"zero or one instance of the previous subexpression\", i.e. an optional element. In certain implementations of the [[BASIC]] programming language, the <code>?</code> character may be used as a shorthand for the \"print\" function; in others (notably the [[BBC BASIC]] family), <code>?</code> is used to address a single-byte memory location. In [[OCaml]], the question mark precedes the label for an optional parameter. In [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]], as a convention, symbol names ending in <code>?</code> are used for predicates, such as <code>odd?</code>, <code>null?</code>, and <code>eq?</code>. Similarly, in [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], method names ending in <code>?</code> are used for predicates. In [[Swift (programming language)|Swift]], a type followed by <code>?</code> denotes an [[option type]]; <code>?</code> is also used in \"optional chaining\", where if an option value is nil, it ignores the following operations. In [[APL (programming language)|APL]], <code>?</code> generates random numbers or a random subset of indices. In [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]], a <code>?</code> suffix on a function or method call indicates error handling.\n\nIn many [[Web browser]]s and other computer programs, when converting text between encodings, it may not be possible to map some characters into the target [[character set]]. In this situation it is common to replace each unmappable character with a question mark <samp>?</samp>, inverted question mark <samp>\u00bf</samp>, or the Unicode [[replacement character]], usually rendered as a white question mark in a black diamond: {{unichar|FFFD|REPLACEMENT CHARACTER}}. This commonly occurs for apostrophes and quotation marks when they are written with software that uses its own proprietary non-standard code for these characters, such as [[Microsoft Office]]'s [[Quotation marks in English#Smart quotes|\"smart quotes\"]].\n\nThe generic [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] syntax allows for a [[query string]] to be appended to a resource location in a Web address so that additional information can be passed to a script; the query mark, <code>?</code>, is used to indicate the start of a query string. A query string is usually made up of a number of different field/value pairs, each separated by the [[ampersand]] symbol, <code>&</code>, as seen in this URL:\n\n<code><nowiki>http://www.example.com/search.php?query=testing&database=English</nowiki></code>\n\nHere, a script on the page <samp>search.php</samp> on the server <samp>www.example.com</samp> is to provide a response to the query string containing the pairs <samp>query=</samp><kbd>testing</kbd> and <samp>database=</samp><kbd>English</kbd>.\n\n==Games==\nIn [[algebraic chess notation]], some [[chess punctuation]] conventions include: \"'''?'''\" denotes a bad move, \"'''??'''\" a [[blunder (chess)|blunder]], \"'''?!'''\" a [[dubious]] move, and \"'''!?'''\" an interesting move.\n\nIn [[Scrabble]], a question mark indicates a blank tile.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.tucsonscrabble.com/articles/glossary.html |title=Scrabble Glossary |publisher=Tucson Scrabble Club |access-date=February 6, 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Mathematics and formal logic==\n{{anchor|Mathematics|reason=Original section name.}}\nIn [[mathematics]], \"'''?'''\" commonly denotes [[Minkowski's question mark function]]. In equations, it can mean \"questioned\" as opposed to \"defined\".\n\n*{{unichar|225F|QUESTIONED EQUAL TO}}\n*{{unichar|2A7B|LESS-THAN WITH QUESTION MARK ABOVE}}\n*{{unichar|2A7C|GREATER-THAN WITH QUESTION MARK ABOVE}}\n\nIn [[linear logic]], the question mark denotes one of the exponential modalities that control weakening and contraction.\n\n==Medicine==\nA question mark is used in English medical notes to suggest a possible [[diagnosis]]. It facilitates the recording of a doctor's impressions regarding a patient's symptoms and signs. For example, for a patient presenting with left [[lower abdominal pain]], a differential diagnosis might include ''?[[diverticulitis]]'' (read as \"query diverticulitis\").\n\n==See also==\n* [[Exclamation mark]]\n* [[Interrobang]]\n* [[Irony mark]]\n* [[Terminal punctuation]]\n* [[Inquiry]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Lupton |first1=Ellen |last2=Miller |first2=J.
