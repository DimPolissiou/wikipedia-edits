The series began serialization in the June 2007 issue of [[Kodansha]]'s ''[[Magazine Special]]'' and ran in that magazine until the July 2008 issue, where it was thereafter transferred to Kodansha's ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Magazine]]'' in September 2008, and has been running there since. Chapters are collected and published in collected volumes by [[Kodansha]], with eighteen volumes released as of August 2019 in Japan. A 13-episode [[anime]] television series adaptation animated by [[GoHands]] aired in Japan between July and September 2010 and has been licensed by [[Sentai Filmworks]]. A second anime season aired between January and March 2014. An anime film premiered in July 2017, and a second anime film will premiere in July 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nTakatoshi Tsuda attends \u014csai Academy, a high school that, due to declining birth rates, is converted from an [[Single-sex education|all-girl school]] to a [[Mixed-sex education|co-ed school]] (with a male-to-female ratio of 28:524). On his first day, he is forcibly recruited into the [[student council]] as the vice-president and sole male representative. The story follows Tsuda and the student council as they interact with each other and their schoolmates.\n\n==Characters==\n<!-- Please provide citations to manga chapters, anime episodes, official profiles, or author notes / critics reviews that explain the character and its development -->\n\n===Main characters===\n;Takatoshi Tsuda\n;{{voiced by|[[Shintar\u014d Asanuma]].<ref name=\"dvd9cdjapan\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/detailview.html?KEY=NEOBK-1479257|title=Seitokai Yakuindomo 9 (Limited Edition) w/ Anime DVD|publisher=CD Japan|accessdate=October 10, 2013}}</ref>}}\n:{{Nihongo|Takatoshi Tsuda|\u6d25\u7530 \u30bf\u30ab\u30c8\u30b7|Tsuda Takatoshi}} is the main character of the story.

She suggests that one of her original reasons she showed an interest in Takatoshi is so that she could observe him in health and physical education classes.{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. p1}} Although she has excellent grades and is skilled in a wide range of subjects, she [[Acrophobia|fears heights]]{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. p2, p10}} and [[Entomophobia|insects]],{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. 2}} and her rather flat chest makes her feel self-conscious,{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. p10}} especially when comparing herself to Aria.{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. p13}} She occasionally performs couple-like activities with Takatoshi such as walking with him, sharing an umbrella or clearing his earwax, but gets embarrassed whenever Takatoshi says anything that could be interpreted as being romantic (as the series progresses, it is hinted she has feelings for Takatoshi, though she has denied it when directly asked).<ref name=ep11>''Seitokai Yakuindomo'' TV series, episode 11</ref> According to her childhood friend Misaki Amano, Shino was student council president at her previous school.{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. 60|:extra}}\n\n;Aria Shichijo\n;{{voiced by|[[Satomi Sat\u014d]]<ref name=\"dvd9cdjapan\"/>}}\n:{{Nihongo|Aria Shichij\u014d|\u4e03\u6761 \u30a2\u30ea\u30a2|Shichij\u014d Aria}} is the student council secretary and in the same year as Shino;{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. p1}} they are good friends.{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. p11}} She comes from an affluent family and is the most physically mature character. However, she has a strongly perverted mind; like Shino, she has a habit of twisting every word and thought into something sexual.{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. p1, p4, p5}} Because she is absurdly rich and overly pampered,{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. p5}} she can be a social airhead: for instance, she will wait in front of a door and expect it to slide open{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. p10}} or stand at the bottom of a staircase expecting it to be an escalator.{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. p7}}  In contrast, she is academically smart and places second in midterms for her class year, right behind Shino.{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. p4}} Her chest is larger than Shino's,{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. p4}} which causes the latter to feel self-conscious.{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. p10, p13}}\n\n;Suzu Hagimura\n;{{voiced by|[[Sayuri Yahagi]]<ref name=\"dvd9cdjapan\"/>}}\n:{{Nihongo|Suzu Hagimura|\u8429\u6751 \u30b9\u30ba|Hagimura Suzu}} is the student council treasurer and in the same year as Takatoshi.{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. p1}} She describes herself as a returning student with an IQ of 180, can do 10-digit arithmetic calculations in her head,{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. p1}} and is fluent in multiple languages including English.{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. p1, p6}} Even though she is 16 years old at the start of the series, she is no taller than an elementary school student and is [[Napoleon complex|very sensitive about her short stature]].{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. p1}} Many of the jokes involve her childish appearance or height and she flies into a rage whenever such subjects are mentioned. Although initially reluctant to accept Takatoshi as a member of the student council, she soon becomes dependent on him, to the point of feeling uneasy when he's not around, and it is hinted on multiple occasions later in the series that she may be developing feelings for him.

The series began serialization in the June 2007 issue of [[Kodansha]]'s ''[[Magazine Special]]'' and ran in that magazine until the July 2008 issue, where it was thereafter transferred to Kodansha's ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Magazine]]'' in September 2008, and has been running there since. Chapters are collected and published in collected volumes by [[Kodansha]], with eighteen volumes released as of August 2019 in Japan. A 13-episode [[anime]] television series adaptation animated by [[GoHands]] aired in Japan between July and September 2010 and has been licensed by [[Sentai Filmworks]]. A second anime season aired between January and March 2014. An anime film premiered in July 2017, and a second anime film will premiere in July 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nTakatoshi Tsuda attends \u014csai Academy, a high school that, due to declining birth rates, is converted from an [[Single-sex education|all-girl school]] to a [[Mixed-sex education|co-ed school]] (with a male-to-female ratio of 28:524). On his first day, he is forcibly recruited into the [[student council]] as the vice-president and sole male representative.

She suggests that one of her original reasons she showed an interest in Takatoshi is so that she could observe him in health and physical education classes.{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. p1}} Although she has excellent grades and is skilled in a wide range of subjects, she [[Acrophobia|fears heights]]{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. p2, p10}} and [[Entomophobia|insects]],{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. 2}} and her rather flat chest makes her feel self-conscious,{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. p10}} especially when comparing herself to Aria.{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. p13}} She occasionally performs couple-like activities with Takatoshi such as walking with him, sharing an umbrella or clearing his earwax, but gets embarrassed whenever Takatoshi says anything that could be interpreted as being romantic (as the series progresses, it is hinted she has feelings for Takatoshi, though she has denied it when directly asked).<ref name=ep11>''Seitokai Yakuindomo'' TV series, episode 11</ref> According to her childhood friend Misaki Amano, Shino was student council president at her previous school.{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. 60|:extra}}\n\n;Aria Shichijo\n;{{voiced by|[[Satomi Sat\u014d]]<ref name=\"dvd9cdjapan\"/>}}\n:{{Nihongo|Aria Shichij\u014d|\u4e03\u6761 \u30a2\u30ea\u30a2|Shichij\u014d Aria}} is the student council secretary and in the same year as Shino;{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. p1}} they are good friends.{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. p11}} She comes from an affluent family and is the most physically mature character. However, she has a strongly perverted mind; like Shino, she has a habit of twisting every word and thought into something sexual.{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. p1, p4, p5}} Because she is absurdly rich and overly pampered,{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. p5}} she can be a social airhead: for instance, she will wait in front of a door and expect it to slide open{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. p10}} or stand at the bottom of a staircase expecting it to be an escalator.{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. p7}}  In contrast, she is academically smart and places second in midterms for her class year, right behind Shino.{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. p4}} Her chest is larger than Shino's,{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. p4}} which causes the latter to feel self-conscious.{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. p10, p13}}\n\n;Suzu Hagimura\n;{{voiced by|[[Sayuri Yahagi]]<ref name=\"dvd9cdjapan\"/>}}\n:{{Nihongo|Suzu Hagimura|\u8429\u6751 \u30b9\u30ba|Hagimura Suzu}} is the student council treasurer and in the same year as Takatoshi.{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. p1}} She describes herself as a returning student with an IQ of 180, can do 10-digit arithmetic calculations in her head,{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. p1}} and is fluent in multiple languages including English.{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. p1, p6}} Even though she is 16 years old at the start of the series, she is no taller than an elementary school student and is [[Napoleon complex|very sensitive about her short stature]].{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. p1}} Many of the jokes involve her childish appearance or height and she flies into a rage whenever such subjects are mentioned. Although initially reluctant to accept Takatoshi as a member of the student council, she soon becomes dependent on him, to the point of feeling uneasy when he's not around, and it is hinted on multiple occasions later in the series that she may be developing feelings for him.

Over time, the newspaper's coverage expanded further into [[political economy]] and eventually began running articles on current events, finance, commerce, and British politics. Throughout the mid- to late- 20th century, it greatly expanded its layout and format, adding [[Op-ed|opinion columns]], special reports, [[Political cartoon|political cartoons]], [[Letter to the editor|reader letters]], cover stories, art critique, book reviews, and technology features. The paper is often recognizable by its [[fire engine red|fire-engine-red]] nameplate and illustrated, topical covers. Individual articles are written anonymously, with [[Byline|no byline]], in order for the paper to speak as one collective voice. The paper is supplemented by its sister lifestyle magazine, ''[[1843 (magazine)|1843]]'', and a variety of podcasts, films, and books.\n\nThe [[The Economist editorial stance|editorial stance of ''The Economist'']] primarily revolves around [[classical liberalism|classical]], [[Social liberalism|social]], and most notably, [[economic liberalism]]. Since its founding, it has supported [[radical centrism]], favoring polices and governments that maintain [[Centrism|centrist politics]]. The newspaper advocates for [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal economics]], particularly [[Free market|free markets]], [[free trade]], [[free immigration]] and [[Globalization|globalisation]]. Despite a pronounced editorial stance, it is seen as having little [[reporting bias]], rigorous [[Fact-checking|fact checking]] and strict [[copy editing]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2009/04/when-will-magazines-stop-trying-to-copy-the-economist|title=Why Time and Newsweek Will Never Be The Economist|last=Pressman|first=Matt|date=April 20, 2009|website=Vanity Fair|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=March 11, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/berlinschoolofcreativeleadership/2017/02/01/10-journalism-brands-where-you-will-find-real-facts-rather-than-alternative-facts/|title=10 Journalism Brands Where You Find Real Facts Rather Than Alternative Facts|last=Leadership|first=The Berlin School Of Creative|date=February 1, 2017|website=Forbes|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=March 10, 2020}}</ref> Its extensive use of [[Word play|word play]], [[Subscription (finance)|subscription]] prices, and typical depth of coverage has linked the paper with a high-income and educated readership, drawing both positive and negative connotations in the [[Western world|Western World]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedrum.com/opinion/2019/01/31/why-the-economist-swapped-its-famous-elitist-marketing-emotional-messaging|title=Why The Economist swapped its famous elitist marketing for emotional messaging|last=Burnell|first=Ian|date=31 January 2019|website=The Drum|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=11 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Peters|first=Jeremy W.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/09/business/media/09economist.html|title=The Economist Tends Its Sophisticate Garden|date=2010-08-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-03-13|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> In line with this, it claims to have influential readership of prominent business leaders and [[Policy|policy-makers]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:James Wilson by Sir John Watson-Gordon.jpg|thumb|Scottish economist [[James Wilson (businessman)|James Wilson]] founded the newspaper to \"take part in a severe [[Debate|contest between intelligence]], which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reed.edu/reed-magazine/articles/2017/contest-letter-editor.html|title=The Contest|last=Lydgate|first=Chris|date=March 1, 2017|website=Reed Magazine|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=March 1, 2017}}</ref>]]\n''The Economist'' was founded by the British businessman and banker [[James Wilson (businessman)|James Wilson]] in 1843, to advance the repeal of the [[Corn Laws]], a system of import tariffs.<ref>[http://mitpress.typepad.com/mitpresslog/2007/01/from_corn_laws_.html From the Corn Laws to Your Mailbox], The MIT Press Log, 30 January 2007.

Over time, the newspaper's coverage expanded further into [[political economy]] and eventually began running articles on current events, finance, commerce, and British politics. Throughout the mid- to late- 20th century, it greatly expanded its layout and format, adding [[Op-ed|opinion columns]], special reports, [[Political cartoon|political cartoons]], [[Letter to the editor|reader letters]], cover stories, art critique, book reviews, and technology features. The paper is often recognizable by its [[fire engine red|fire-engine-red]] nameplate and illustrated, topical covers. Individual articles are written anonymously, with [[Byline|no byline]], in order for the paper to speak as one collective voice. The paper is supplemented by its sister lifestyle magazine, ''[[1843 (magazine)|1843]]'', and a variety of podcasts, films, and books.\n\nThe [[The Economist editorial stance|editorial stance of ''The Economist'']] primarily revolves around [[classical liberalism|classical]], [[Social liberalism|social]], and most notably, [[economic liberalism]].

Well-written or witty responses from anyone are considered, and controversial issues frequently produce a torrent of letters. For example, the survey of [[corporate social responsibility]], published January 2005, produced largely critical letters from [[Oxfam]], the [[World Food Programme]], [[United Nations Global Compact]], the Chairman of [[BT Group]], an ex-Director of [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] and the UK [[Institute of Directors]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.business-humanrights.org/Links/Repository/542754 |title= Compilation: Full text of responses to Economist survey on Corporate Social Responsibility (January\u2013February 2005)|accessdate=3 February 2007|work=Business & Human Rights}}</ref>\n\nMany of the letters published are critical of its stance or commentary.

He was a warrior Hindu prince and de facto head of the kingdom of [[Kottayam (Malabar)|Kottayam]], otherwise known as Cotiote, in [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]], India, between 1774 and 1805. His struggles with the British [[East India Company]] is known as the [[Cotiote War]]. He is popularly known as '''''Kerala Simham''''' ('''''Lion of Kerala''''') on account of his martial exploits.\n\nmahajoob pez was a member of the western branch of the Kottayam royal clan. When [[Hyder Ali]] of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] [[Mysore invasion of Kerala|occupied Malabar]] in 1773, the Raja of Kottayam found political asylum in [[Travancore]]. Pazhassi Raja, the fourth prince in line for succession to the throne during this period, became one of the ''de facto'' heads of state, surpassing several older royal contenders. He fought a war of resistance against the Mysorean army from 1774 to 1793. On account of his refusal to flee and due to his effective resistance to Mysoreans, he gained firm support of his subjects.\n\nIn 1792, after the [[Third Anglo-Mysore War]], the East India Company imposed control in Kottayam in violation of an earlier agreement of 1790 which had recognised its independence. [[Vira Varma]], to whom Raja was a nephew, was appointed by the East India Company authorities as the Raja of Kottayam. To meet revenue targets fixed by Company authorities, Vira Varma ordered an exorbitant tax to be collected from the peasantry and this move was met in 1793 by a mass resistance led by Pazhassi Raja, who had always been opposed to the Company's rule. In 1796, the Company made an attempt to arrest Pazhassi Raja, but he evaded capture and instead fought back using guerilla warfare. After a string of serious setbacks, the Company sued for peace in 1797. The conflict was renewed in 1800 over a dispute on Wayanad and after a five-year-long war of insurgency, Pazhassi Raja was killed on 30 November 1805 in a gun-fight at Mavila Thodu (small body of water), in the present day Kerala-Karnataka border.\n\n==Kingdom==\nPazhassi Raja was born in the Padinjare Kovilakam (Western Branch) of Purannattu Swarupam, Peralam Village, the royal clan of the kingdom of Kottayam in North Malabar not [[Kottayam]] District in south Kerala. This branch was located at Pazhassi which lay south west of [[Mattannur]]. Kerala Varma got the name Pazhassi Raja as he was a native of Pazhassi. The early British documents wrote ''Pazhassi Raja'' as ''Pychy Rajah'', while the name ''Cotiote Raja'' comes from the anglicizing of ''Kottayam'' to ''Cotiote''. Kottayam covers what is today the [[Thalassery]] taluk of the [[Kannur District]] and [[Wayanad district]], along with the [[Gudalur, Nilgiris|Gudalur]] taluk of [[Nilgiris district]].{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=24}}\n\nAs a royal clan, Purannattu Swarupam had three branches: a western branch (Padinjare Kovilakam) at Pazhassi, near Mattannur, an eastern branch (Kizhakke Kovilakam) at Manatana, near Peravoor, and a southern branch (Tekke Kovilakam) at Kottayampoil, near Koothuparamba.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Wayanad \u2013 Its People and Traditions by C. Gopalan Nair</ref>\n\n==Resistance to Mysore occupation (1773\u20131793)==\nPazhassi Raja's warfare with Mysore troops can be divided into two phases based on the rulers of the kingdom of Mysore. First phase lasted from 1773 to 1782 during which time, the Mysore ruler was [[Hyder Ali]]. The second phase extended from 1784 to 1793 and during this phase he fought the troops of [[Tipu Sultan]], son and successor of Hyder Ali.\n\n===Resistance to Hyder Ali (1773\u20131782)===\nIn 1773, Hyder Ali marched into Malabar for the second time,{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=295}} for non-payment of tributes from the Rajas (kings) of Malabar as agreed after war in 1768. Most of the ''Rajas'' of Malabar, along with many ''Naduvazhis'' or vassals fled to seek political asylum in Travancore. Princes and younger noblemen who refused to flee the invasion organised resistances. The Malabari partisans made excellent use of the wooded hills that covered most of Malabar during this rebellion.\n\nIn 1774, at the age of 21, Pazhassi Raja took over the throne to replace his uncle who had fled to Travancore. He vowed to resist Hyder Ali's troops, and stayed in Kottayam{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=13}} , where he gathered a force and began guerrilla battles against the troops of Mysore as he had neither guns nor troops enough to face them in an open battle. He set up a large number of bases in the nearly impenetrable forested mountains of Puralimala and Wynad and repeatedly inflicted severe minor losses on the Mysore army in Kottayam as well as in Wynad.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=58}}\n\nOnce the true Raja of Kottayam had fled, three royals rose to power in Kottayam. The nephew of the escaped Raja named [[Vira Varma]] and his nephews, Ravi Varma and Pazhassi Raja now took over the reins of government. Vira Varma was skilled in political intrigue and manipulation whereas Ravi Varma was too incompetent to play any serious political role and hence his role only was nominal. Pazhassi Raja become the most powerful figure in Kottayam, much to the chagrin of his uncle Vira Varma. Hence Vira Varma played a series of power games aiming to check the growing clout of his nephew. So the relation between Vira Varma and Pazhassi Raja was one of enmity right from the onset.\n\nThe military situation was grim for ''Pazhassi Raja'' and his troops&nbsp;\u2013 in 1774, [[Kodagu|Coorgs]] had joined hands with Hyder Ali on the promise of being gifted Wynad and a large Coorg army camped in Wynad to help Mysore troops. In 1776, Hyder Ali re-installed the Hindu Raja in Chirakkal {{sfnp|Menon|2007|p=295}} and the latter joined Mysore war effort to crush Pazhassi Raja.{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=13}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=24}} This triple alliance which lasted till 1780 reached nowhere near defeating the Kottayam army.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nDuring his long war with the Mysore and then the English East India Company, Pazhassi Raja increased his sphere of influence significantly eastwards as far as the outskirts of Mysore. His men regularly looted enemy treasuries and sandalwood from southern Karnataka and his enemies could do little to check these raids. This enabled him to lay claim on a great chunk of the Mysore district&nbsp;\u2013 as far as Nanjangod in the east. Also, Pazhassi Raja and his men frequently raided the domains of neighbouring Rajas in northern Malabar and Coorg to harass the enemy regiments posted there and he was often supported by local population of those territories. Along with this, he had close ties with [[Ravi Varma of Padinjare Kovilakam|Ravi Varma]] and [[Krishna Varma]], who were princes of Calicut and popular rebel leaders of southern Malabar.\n\n====Siege of Thalasseri====\n[[Thalassery|Thalasseri]] or Tellicherry in the late 18th century was a harbour-fort which was held by the British East India Company as a factory. The value of Tellicherry as a naval base meant that her capture could seriously impact the British naval situation on the west coast. Also rebels in North Malabar bought arms and ammunition from the British in Tellicherry. So if Hyder could capture this fort, he could, at a stroke, cripple both the rebels in North Malabar as well as the British military power at a regional basis.\n\nSo in 1778, Hyder's vassal, the Raja of Chirakkal, besieged Thalasseri and enforced an economic blockade under order from Hyder himself.{{sfnp|Menon|2007|p=296}} The British factories at Talassery armed Pazhassi Raja's men to enable them to recover Kottayam from the Mysorean occupation army. This move by the British ensured that the Chirakkal army was now at risk of being struck in the rear by Pazhassi Raja's force. The Chirakkal troops began to retreat, but Pazhassi chased and devastated the Chirakkal army, and then marched to Kottayam where he obliterated the Mysorean occupation and overran all of western Kottayam. But at this critical moment when the Mysorean army in Malabar could have been destroyed by a joint action on the part of the British and the Rajas, the British factories at Talassery were instructed by the Governor not to upset the nominal peace with Hyder.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nThus the British decision not to exploit the victory at Thalasseri was exploited by Mysore. The Chirakkal army reinforced by a Mysorean contingent under Balwant Rao marched into Kottayam. Pazhassi's men, though secretly supplied with arms and ammunition by the British, could not hold or defeat this huge host and soon the [[Kottayam (Malabar)|Kottayam]] army was forced to disperse after a fight. Then the Mysore-Chirakkal army captured Kadathanad and installed a puppet Raja who joined hands with Mysore. In 1779, a huge Mysore-Chirakkal-Kadathanad army besieged Thalasseri. Pazhassi Raja sent a force of 2000 Nairs to aid the British defence of Thalassery, and this enabled the factories to hold on successfully.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=27}}{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=14}}\n\nBy the end of 1779, Sardar Khan, the Mysorean general was sent to Thalasseri to bring the siege speedily to a successful conclusion.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=296}}{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=14}} Sardar Khan came with a force of 10,000 troops and 30 heavy guns.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Murland|first1=Lieutenant Colonel HF|title=Baillie-Ki-Paltan: A History of the 2nd Battalion, Madras Pioneers 1759 - 1930|date=2005|publisher=The Naval and Military Press Ltd|location=East Sussex|page=48}}</ref> Sardar Khan knew that it was Pazhassi Raja's help that enabled the British to resist him and so he opened negotiations with Pazhassi&nbsp;\u2013 his offer was the restoration of Mysore occupied territories of Kottayam if Pazhassi would ally himself with Mysore and pay an immediate tribute of 500,000 rupees. It was well beyond the capacity of Kottayam to raise so huge a sum in so short a time. But Pazhassi did his best to pay Sardar Khan [probably in the hope that the latter would make concessions] and 60,000 rupees was paid to the latter. But Khan was not satisfied and rejected Pazhassi's request that his possessions in Malabar be restored.{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=27}} This greedy and tactless approach of Sardar Khan's made sure that there was little chance for Mysore to capture Thalasseri. The Kottayam army became far stronger with their major victory in 1779 at Kalpetta (Wynad) where the whole Coorg army of 2,000 was surrounded and decimated by Pazhassi Raja's troops. The destruction of the Coorg army in Wynad enabled Raja to throw a whole new army into the contest at Thalasseri.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nIn 1780, Pazhassi Raja proposed a plan to the British to break the Mysorean siege of Thalassery: he and his men would strike the enemy in the rear from the east as the British came out of the fort and struck the Mysorean line in front. Both armies would effect a junction that would split the enemy into two. The Mysorean and allied troops could then be routed easily. But it was only in 1781 that the British understood the value of this plan and their Bombay authorities agreed to it. An operation was carried out as per Pazhassi's plan; it ended with the destruction of the Mysorean forces. Sardar Khan himself was killed. What followed was a rebellion in Kottayam by the Nayar militia led by Pazhassi Raja. Soon, the Mysoreans were ousted.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=28}}\n\n===Rebellion to remove Tipu Sultan (1784\u20131793)===\nBy 1782, Kottayam was once more a free land. But by the Treaty of Mangalore (1784) after the Second Anglo-Mysore War, the British recognised [[Tipu Sultan]]'s sphere of authority in Malabar. Thus with its only valuable ally lost, Kottayam was ready to become a vassal state of Mysore. Once more, as Sardar Khan did in 1779, Mysore exacted an exorbitant rate of tribute. Although Ravi Varma, the elder brother of Pazhassi Raja agreed to pay 65,000 rupees per year, Mysore demanded 81,000 rupees.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=28}} The hiked rate of tribute meant greater hardship for the peasantry (largely Tiyar/Izhava) who had suffered from years of foreign occupation. So Pazhassi Raja took up this issue and decided to launch a mass resistance struggle once more.<ref>Calicut University Text for paper Kerala History and Culture Distance Education MA History 2007 by Prof. SS Warrier</ref>{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=29}}\n\nWhat angered Pazhassi Raja even more was that his brother Ravi Varma who paid a visit to Tipu Sultan in 1786 for peace talks was forced to sign a treaty which ceded Wayanad to Tipu Sultan. Pazhassi Raja decided not to let Tipu enjoy Wayanad in peace and kept up a guerrilla warfare that constantly harassed Mysore troops in Wayanad and its neighbourhood. War in Wayanad lasted for seven years&nbsp;\u2013 till 1793&nbsp;\u2013 when the last of the Mysorean garrisons were expelled from the soil of Wayanad.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nBy the end of 1788, Pazhassi Raja's hatred of Tipu had shot up on account of the latter's policy of forcible conversion. So he strengthened his ties with the British on one hand and with fellow rebel chiefs and princes in Malabar on the other. Tipu sent an army under a French general named Lally with a genocidal mission\u2014the extermination of the [[Nair]] caste from Kottayam to Palakkad&nbsp;\u2013 as Tipu was determined to end the menace of Nair rebels in Malabar who had foiled all attempts of him and his late father Hyder Ali to subjugate and exploit Malabar.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=29}}\n\nThe senior Rajah of Kottayam fled to Travancore fearing the Sultan. But before that, he handed over charge of government to Pazhassi Raja and asked him to save the country from Mysore's onslaught. Given below is the observation made by historian Rajayyan about Pazhassi Raja's resistance to Tipu Sultan after the exodus of Rajas from Malabar in 1788:\n\n{{Quote|Between 1787 and 1788, the ''thampurans'' or Rajahs of Malabar, threatened by the forces of Tipu, fled to Travancore. Among them were the princes of Kottayathu.....The Senior Rajah before his flight summoned Kerala Varma, the youngest prince, and instructed him to protect the country. Accordingly, the latter assembled the inhabitants, retired to the jungles and assisted them in the development of a new homeland.  Frequently, in defiance to the authority of the Sultan, he with a band of determined followers issued forth from the woods and levied contributions.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=90}}}}\n\nBut in 1790, Tipu abandoned the war in Malabar as the war in Deccan drew his attention. Pazhassi Raja joined the British with a force of 1500 [[Nair]]s to capture the Mysorean stronghold in Katirur (near Talassery).{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=31}} After Katirur, Pazhassi Raja and his troops moved south-east and captured the Kuttiyadi fort from Tipu's men.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=32}} Thus once more, the whole of Kottayam was under the control of Pazhassi Raja.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=60}} In 1790, the British recognised Pazhassi Raja as the head of Kottayam instead of the original Raja who was in refuge at Travancore. Raja agreed to pay 25,000 rupees as tribute to the British. But his struggle with the Mysore troops continued in Wayanad till 1793 when he freed that land also.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nBut by the Treaty of Seringapatam (1792) signed between the British and Tipu after the latter failed in Third Anglo-Mysore War, Malabar was ceded to the British.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=60}}  The British then began to work for the establishment of their supremacy in Malabar.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} This was where the British and Pazhassi Raja had opposite opinions&nbsp;\u2013 Pazhassi Raja helped the British not because he was ready to accept British sovereignty but because he wanted his country Kottayam to be a free land.<ref>Evolution of Kerala History and Culture, Prof. T. K. Gangadharan, 2004, Calicut University Central Cooperative Stores Ltd, No.4347, Calicut University 673,635</ref>\n\nPazhassi Raja was disturbed when he heard about the terms which the British put forward to the Rajas of Malabar in 1792, because the British had signed a cowl with him in 1790 which promised to respect the independence of Kottayam.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=35}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Menon|first1=A Sreedhara|title=Kerala Charitrashilpikal|date=2007|publisher=DC Books|location=Kottayam 686 001|isbn=81-264-1584-3|page=191}}</ref> The summary of the British terms in 1792 were as follows:\n* The Raja to be able to rule as before, but the British to control him \u201cin case of oppressing inhabitants\u201d.\n* A resident to be appointed to enquire about \u201ccomplaints of oppression\u201d.\n* Two persons on the part of the British and two persons on the part of the Raja to make valuation of the land revenue of Kottayam.\n* The tax to be paid by each subject to be ascertained.\n* The Raja's tribute to be settled in October 1792 according to the appearance of crop.\n* The British share of the pepper to be delivered at a price fixed by the British in December 1792.\n* The remainder of the pepper to be bought only by merchants appointed by the British.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nThese terms converted monarchs to mere agents of the British. Rajas were now stripped of their right to rule as they willed; they also lost control over their economies.\n\nKottayam was represented by Vira Varma, uncle of Pazhassi Raja during talks with the British in 1792. Vira Varma concluded a treaty with British by which he accepted all terms and conditions put forward by them.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n==Resistance to British rule&nbsp;\u2014 the Cotiote War==\n[[Image:PazhassiMemorial.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Pazhassi Kudeeram-a memorial for Pazhassi Raja at his burial spot in Mananthavadi, [[Wayanad district|Wayanad]], [[Kerala]], designed by Architect [[Eugene Pandala]]]]\n\nPazhassi Raja resisted British imperialism from 1793 onwards till his death in 1805.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=60}} He fought two wars to resist British intervention in the domestic affairs of his kingdom. From 1793\u20131797 he fought over the question of the management of Kottayam and from 1800\u20131805 over the issue of who was to be master of Wynad. British called their wars with Pazhassi Rajah as Cotiote War\n\n===First revolt (1793\u20131797)===\n\nPazhassi Raja was not on good terms with his uncle Vira Varma, Raja of Kurumbranad. In 1793, foxy Vira Varma who had surrendered Kottayam to British back in 1792, convinced British Commissioners to let him collect tax in Kottayam.{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=16}} He calculated that a good collection might please the British and that that would let him seize all of Kottayam.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=38}} British had by this time adopted a hostile approach to Pazhassi Raja who had consistently refused to accept British suzerainty and hence they made obedient Vira Varma as head of Kottayam{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=60}} Pazhassi Raja was angry at this British move. He felt betrayed.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=91}} After all, he was the only Raja in Northern Malabar to have helped the British consistently in the war with Mysore.{{sfnp|Menon|2007|p=313}}\n\nVira Varma Raja, on the one hand, undertook to collect tax in Kottayam directly, but on the other hand, he instigated Pazhassi Raja to oppose the British. Moreover, the British assessment was harsh and beyond the peasants' capacity to pay. They resisted its forcible collection by the agents of the British, and Pazhassi Raja took up their cause. As seen before, Raja was deadly opposed to extortion of the peasantry.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=61}}\n\nIn 1793, Pazhassi Raja made sure that no tax was collected in Kottayam by the British&nbsp;\u2013 as a mark of his protest.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=60}} He also threatened that if British officials did not give up their enumeration of pepper vines, he would have the vines destroyed.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=91}} Local British authorities, however, debated with Raja and soon both discovered Vira Varma's dirty games. So the British put forward a solution acceptable to the Raja by which 20 percent of gross revenue would go to Raja and another 20 percent would go for the temples' expense. No tax would be imposed on temple property in the immediate future.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=42}}{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=29}}\n\nIn 1793, Tipu's Vakils protested to the British that Pazhassi Raja, who was a British tributary, had overrun most of Wayanad, still under Mysore. Soon the Raja was supreme in the Wayanad Plateau.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=36}}\n\nBut the Governor General unwisely revoked the agreement in 1794 and gave Kottayam to Kurumbranad Raja on a five-year lease.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=91}}{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=61}}{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=30}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=43}} The Raja was truly angry at this decision and decided to retaliate by ruling his country as per customary law. The year before the lease was concluded the Raja had provided asylum to a Nayar noble, Narangoli Nambiar belongs to the Iruvazinad royal clan, who had been declared an outlaw by British for the murder of three men who had killed his kinsman. The Raja's kind treatment of Nambiar irritated the British.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=62}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=45}} The British also became angry that the Raja impaled two robbers as per customary law.{{sfnp|Menon|2007|p=314}} British planned to arrest Raja for 'murder', but gave up the idea as the Raja had a bodyguard of 500 well armed Wayanad Nayars.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nIn 1795, even after a year, Vira Varma Raja got Kottayam on lease, he was not able to collect tax in Kottayam-thanks to his nephew Raja's determination. So British troops arrived in Kottayam to help Vira Varma's tax collectors, but Pazhassi Raja's men resisted them with success.{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=30}}{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=314}}\n\nIn 1796, orders were issued from Bombay to collect tax arrears for 2 years in Kottayam. For British no more pretexts were needed to arrest Raja. 300 men under Lieutenant James Gordon marched from Talassery and seized Raja's fortified house at Pazhassi-but Raja fled four days earlier to Manattana (near Kottiyur). Gordon plundered the palace where traditional treasure of Raja was kept.{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=30}}{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=92}} Raja was angry at this loot and sent a letter to Supervisor at Thalassery.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=62}}{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=314}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=48}}\n\nRaja was also angry that one of his former general named [[Pazhayamviden Chandu]] had become an agent of Kurumbranad Raja and what angered him even more than that was that this turn-coat had the audacity to boss him with Vira Varma's and British blessings.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Raja shifted his HQ to Purali Range and then into Wayanad. Raja then blocked all British communications between Wayanad and Low Malabar through Kuttiyadi Pass.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=48}} The British retaliated by cutting all communications between Raja and Low Malabar.

Raja offered to give up the struggle provided he was pardoned and his treasure and house restored.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=92}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=49}} The Colonel and Raja being old soldiers hated needless bloodshed and so he forwarded Raja's request to Commissioners, who thought they were bitterly opposed to Raja's independent style, agreed to the Colonel's suggestion as there was a risk that Raja might ally with Tipu.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=92}}\n\nSo Northern Superintendent ordered the restoration of the Raja's house [but not treasure], and the Raja's pardon was confirmed by the Bombay and Supreme Governments.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=92}} But the orders of government were communicated to the Raja via Vira Varma&nbsp;\u2013 which meant that uncle Raja took care not to report to his nephew that the British had agreed to his requests. Uncle Raja had a vested interest in the war between the Company and his nephew Pazhassi Raja.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=49}}\n\nVira Varma also removed [[Kaitheri Ambu]], a favourite noble and general of Raja, from home administration of Kottayam. Ambu along with followers went to Kannavam [also spelled ''Kannavath'' and ''Kannoth''], where he planned and executed a mass resistance with people's support, which made sure that Vira Varma could make no tax collection in Kottayam. But Ambu acted clearly on guidance of Raja, who felt expulsion of Ambu was another of his uncle's conspiracies to undermine him.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nRaja feared that British planned to seize him [not knowing that their truce terms were kept blocked from him by his uncle] and retreated into depths of Wayanad. British troop build up in Wayanad also accelerated his doubts. However, Raja was still eager to avoid a war and came to meet Northern Superintendent with a bodyguard of 1500 armed Nayars. Vira Varma Raja was also ordered to be present. Pazhassi Raja's main demand was that Kottayam must be under his rule-a demand his uncle was not ready to accede.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nBritish Commissioners' attitude also was arrogant-they were already prejudiced towards Raja and so were blind towards Raja's logical argument that Vira Varma had no business in Kottayam. As talks broke down, Commissioners' issued a threat proclamation in Kottayam that if those Kottayam men in service of Raja does not desert him and come home, they would be declared enemies and their properties would be confiscated.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=314}}{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=92}} But this proclamation had little effect in Kottayam where resistance to British-Kurumbranad rule became stronger.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nBritish, to their horror, found out that a large number of Vira Varma's troops had deserted to join ranks of resisters{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=314}}{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=92}} and Vira Varma himself was not much interested to help British-after all his aim was to create a flare-up between his nephew and British for sake of pure self-interest.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nRaja then visited Mysorean commandant at Karkankotta in 1796{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=62}}{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=94}} and in 1797 held an audience with old enemy Tipu in Mysore who posted 6000 men at Karkankotta to aid Raja in case of war and also to supply ammunition to rebels<ref name=\"WFrancis103\">{{cite book |last1=W.

He also began to collect troops and armament. War was imminent. 1200 troops and artillery under Major General was sent by Bombay Government to deal with Pazhassi. British also began to set up outposts in Kottayam and sent more troops to Wayanad.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=314}}{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=32}}\n\nIn early 1797, Nayar militia rose all over Kottayam{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=63}} and British outposts were trapped in a true state of siege. Partisan bands became active all over Kottayam and harassed reinforcements and supply convoys. Same was the case in Wayanad where British troops that moved out of the safety of block-houses risked being way-laid by Kurichia bowmen. British suffered good loss in terms of men, ammunition and stores in these ambuscades.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=314}}{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=95}}\n\n====Victory at Periya Pass====\n\nThis event was the most important in the whole war. In 1797, Colonel Dow & force marches into Wayanad. His plan was to block Periya Pass and then crush a large rebel force in Kannoth once their retreat is blocked.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nReinforcements under Lieutenant Mealy were to reach Dow at Periya, but on way they were severely harassed by a force of Nayars and Kurichias and suffered a casualty of 105 men. So instead of Periya they retreated to their original base.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=63}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=58}}\n\nDow's troops suffered chronic shortage of supplies and so Dow applied for reinforcements and re-supplies to be sent under Major Anderson of Bowles' regiment. But as Mappila guides of Anderson deserted at last moment. That caused a delay in journey of Anderson-a delay that had fatal consequence for British.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=59}}\n\nDow then received news that Tipu had sent sepoys to aid Raja as Tipu considered British entry into Wayanad a violation of Seringapatam Pact. Dow decided that he will go to Talassery to consult authorities there and to plan a greater operation to deal with troops of Raja and Tipu simultaneously in Wayanad. He left with a small band of men but was ambushed on way by Raja's men aided by Mysorean sepoys but Dow escaped unhurt.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=63}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=59}}\n\nThe day after he left, British force of 1100 under Major Cameroon in Periya decided to descend into Kottayam via Periya Pass as their supplies have exhausted.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=64}}\n\nBut what they did not know was that Raja who learned of the true state of British army laid a trap for them-he ordered troops lay concealed in camouflaged stockades built on both sides of the pass. Once the whole British force entered the narrow pass, hidden troops were to pounce on their enemy who must be caught unawares.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=314}}\n\nPlan worked well and what followed was great slaughter of British.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=95}}{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=64}}{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=19}} Had it not been for the arrival of Major Anderson's force the following day, hardly any would have survived due to lack of medical care. Most of the enemy were killed and all their guns, ammunition, baggage and cattle were plundered along with Union colours. Senior British officers like Major Cameroon, Lieutenant Nugent, Lieutenant Madge, and Lieutenant Rudderman were killed in action.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=60}}\n\nAround this time, Commissioners took a decision on the advice of Swaminatha Pattar, a Tamil Brahmin who was the minister of Zamorin that sowed the eventual downfall of Pazhassi Raja. They decided to raise an irregular force of local traitors to harass Pazhassi Raja.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=60}} This force was a forerunner of the Kolkar,{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=64}} who became infamous for their sycophancy to British and cruelty to resisters and people.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nBut for time being, Raja was in a strong position.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=64}}  On account of British disasters, Bombay Government sent a Committee of Government composed of men of highest ranks-Commander-In-Chief Lieutenant-General Stuart and Governor Jonathan Duncan.{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=32}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=60}}{{sfnp|Menon|2007|p=315}} They decided to make peace as they were anxious that guerrilla warfare in a mountainous and forested terrain could last long and that Raja might join forces with Tipu or French. They also decided that Kurumbranad Raja Vira Varma should be ousted from administration of Kottayam.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=60}} Rajas of Chirakkal and Parappanad acted as mediators in negotiation between Raja and British{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=32}}{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=95}} and a peace pact was signed between Pazhassi and British in 1797.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=315}}\n\nThe Treaty of 1797 agreed on following points:{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=95}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=64}}\n* Pazhassi Raja was to be 'pardoned'.\n* He will be returned his treasure.\n* He will be provided an annual allowance of 8000 rupees.\n* He will be given back his confiscated house at Pazhassi.\n* Ravi Varma, elder brother of Pazhassi Raja will be head of Kottayam.\n\nA pardon and restoration of property was also extended to Narangoli Nambiar of Iruvazinad.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=72}}\n\nThus Raja's efforts of four years ended in a political victory. Peace dawned after four years of antagonism and war.\n\nTipu Sultan in his letter to French government notes with glee that British had lost 1,000 European soldiers and 3,000 native sepoys in four years of war between British troops and Kottayam army.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=60}}{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=20}}\n\n===Undeclared hostilities (1797-1800)===\n\nDespite the peace treaty of 1797, real peace did not emerge between Pazhassi Raja and English East India Company. Skirmishes continued across Kottayam. The main reason for this was that the Company did not attempt to end its efforts to subjugate Kottayam and collect tax. But this was successfully foiled by partisans of Pazhassi Raja headed by Kaitheri Ambu.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=77}} Pazhassi Raja also went ahead with his policy of defiance of English directions, continued with his military enlargement program and even shifted his seat of power to Mananthavadi in Wayanad - all of which were deemed as \"injurious to interests of Company in Kottayam\" by Colonel Dow, English representative in Kottayam. But since Raja clearly had the upper hand since the victory of 1797, English was powerless to put an end to his activities.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=73}}\n\n===Second revolt and death (1800\u20131805)===\n\nAfter the fall of Tipu, Wayanad fell to the British. They sent a Mysore Commission to seize Wayanad and planned to annex it to either Canara or Coimbatore.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=78}} But as Wayanad was a traditional possession of Kottayam Raja and that Pazhassi is in control of this region since 1793, Pazhassi correctly saw move was an encroachment on his country's ancient provinces. Raja retaliated by collecting a large force of Nayars which was now supplemented by Mappilas and Pathans,{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=83}} latter being ex-soldiers of Tipu who became unemployed after Tipu's death.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=315}}\n\nBritish Government at Madras appointed Major General [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]] as British army commandant of Mysore, Canara & Malabar.\n\nHe planned a double-pronged move from Malabar Coast and Mysore into Wayanad and began preparations for that end.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=83}} Raja observed Major General-latter had brought reinforcements and building roads in Wayanad and outposts across rebel country. In response, Raja also recruited numerous men which so alarmed Wellesley that latter even wanted to kidnap kith and kin of rebels so as to check Raja's recruitment.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}\n\nRaja learned that Wellesley had left to Deccan on a military mission-Raja who understood that Major General's absence is a great chance swiftly made his move. He marched across Kuttiyadi Pass and below he made a junction with Unni Mootha Mooppan, a Walluvanad Mappila leader & his men and soon several great nobles like Kampuratt Nambiar of Iruvazhinad, Peruvayal Nambiar and [[Kannavath Sankaran Nambiar]] also joined Raja with their men.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=84}}{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=175}}{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=66}}\n\nBy monsoon of 1800, rebels who controlled all of country-side of Kottayam threatened to overwhelm British outposts in Kottayam.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=315}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=85}} Wellesley sent a large force under Colonel Sartorius to recapture rebel-held Kottayam.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=175}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=85}} But the plan could not be carried out as there were not enough troops in Malabar. Wellesley advised Commissioners to stop all communications with Wayanad so as to starve Raja of supplies.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=89}} But the shortage of troops also meant this plan too remained on paper. By the time, Wellesley decided to smash Raja by a double drive from Malabar Coast and Mysore into Wayanad, Manjeri Athan Gurikkal an Ernad Mappila leader along with his followers agreed to support of Raja.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nBy 1801, a large British force of over 10,000 men swarmed all over Kottayam and Wayanad and they blocked all passes that linked Wayanad{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=68}} with Malabar. Before so large numbers, rebels thought wise to go under-ground for time being. Raja also found that he could no longer contact his supporters in Southern Wayanad and Southern Malabar.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=180}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=90}}{{sfnp|Menon|2007|p=316}} Raja became a wanderer in forests but even then, to surprise of British, he ruled out compromise it seems he understood that there was no alternative to full freedom.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nRaja had six close aides and 25 musketeers in his wanderings.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=316}} First, he went north via Payyavur along montane forests of eastern Chirakkal to rally support.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=187}} But the British were on his trail but failed to catch him. Raja then visited his secret bases in Kottayam{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=187}} and then moved into Kadathanad and into jungles of Kurumbranad.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=68}}  British were angered that where ever he went, nobles supported him in secret and decided to punish them for their help to rebel Raja.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=93}}\n\nAs a part of terrorisation, Peruvayal Nambiar who was arrested was hanged. British also threatened brutal penalty and confiscation of property for all those rebels who failed to surrender in six weeks time. But a pardon was also issued for surrendered rebels. But none of these threats and temptations worked and Raja was still at large. But some of his chief supporters were arrested of whom Kannavath Sankaran Nambiar was most famous. Kannavath Sankaran Nambiar and his son were hanged too and their property was confiscated.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=316}}{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=192}}{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=34}}\n\nFollowing murder of Kannavath Nambiar, a deceptive calm descended on North Malabar-calm before the storm. Collector Major MacLeod believed that war was over and went ahead with exploitation program. He immediately declared total disarmament of Malabar{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=101}} and threatened those who kept arms with the death penalty. He also doubled the rate of tax and ordered a reassessment of tax of whole Malabar in a mere forty days.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=316}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=103}}{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=282}}\n\nAll these 'reforms' paid back in 1803 when Malabar was on verge of revolt as people were pushed to wall.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=316}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=103}} MacLeod tried to calm this with corrective measure-He cancelled all his 'reforms' and old system was reinstated. But it was too late for Wayanad where Raja's men were prepared for a rebellion.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n====Capture of Panamaram Fort====\n[[Image:Moat around Panamaram fort site.JPG|thumb|250px|Remains of the Moat surrounded the Panamaram British fort site. Now it is almost covered with creepers and bushes, Panamaram, [[Wayanad district|Wayanad]], Kerala.]]\n[[Image:Koli tree near Panamaram fort site.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Koli tree near Panamaram British fort site. Talakkal Chandu was executed somewhere near this tree.,Panamaram, [[Wayanad district|Wayanad]], Kerala.]]\nThe first major event was the capture of [[Panamaram]] Fort. Edachena Kungan Nair planned the operation and was helped by 150 Kurichia bowmen under Talakkal Chandu. Fort had 70 men under Captain Dickenson and there was a large force of 360 men under Major Drummond only a few miles away in Pulinjali.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=103}} So if Major came to help Captain in time Kurichia force would be overwhelmed by gun-fire and numbers. But Kungan and Chandu decided to take risk.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nThe whole garrison was slaughtered in the surprise attack led by the two generals and they lost only 5 dead and 10 wounded. Dickenson himself was killed.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=69}}{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=21}} Rebels got 112 muskets, six boxes of ammunition and 6000 rupees. They also destroyed the whole fort.(The remains of the fort can be seen now near Panamaram High School).{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=283}}\n\nWellesley was enraged at this rebel audacity and dispatched 500 men to retaliate. But by then rebel victory had roused all of Wayanad and Kottayam.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=316}} Edachena Kungan, the hero of Panamaram success, went to Pulpally shrine and issued a proclamation to people to join Raja's war.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=282}} 3000 men volunteered.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=69}}  They were posted at Valliyurkav at Mananthavadi, Motimjarra [?], and Edappally and 100 of them under the brother of Kungan posted themselves at Periya Pass and 25 men were posted at Kottiyur Pass. Rebel outposts were set up en route from Dindimal to Valliyurkav. The rebel army was mostly composed of archers and swordmen, but some had muskets.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=104}}\n\nEdachena Kungan Nair led an attack on a British detachment headed from Mysore to Mananthavadi. The harassment began once this force entered Wayanad till it reached a stream between Manathavadi and Bhavully river. There they were blocked by a rebel force entrenched on the opposite side of the stream. But to ill luck of rebels, a reinforcement which had caught up with blocked British army outflanked the rebel entrenchment and took a large number of prisoners. All these prisoners were disarmed and marched to a road where they were murdered.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nBesides, British reinforcements arrived in Wayanad from all directions. But British could find rebels nowhere.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=316}}\n\nThe rebels now concentrated in Kottayam. In 1802, they raided a supplies convoy near Kottiyur.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=69}}  British were frustrated by Kottayam people's total lack of co-operation. To add to their trouble, in 1803, a rebel force took to field in Kurumbranad* & Payyormala*{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=283}} and people were sympathetic to rebels.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=106}} Kungan marched towards Pazhassi to wipe out the British outpost there but had to retreat, though British suffered serious losses. Soon rebellion spread into Chirakkal where armed bands of partisans launched operations and often fought British openly. Raja's army by end of 1803 was ranging as far as Kannur and Thalasseri.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=316}}{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=21}}{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=283}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=111}}{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=70}} An estimated 3350 partisans of Pazhassi Raja took part in this operation that extended south as far as Ernad.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=69}}\n\nIn March 1803, a rebel force marched as far as Calicut and captured Sub-Jail where they killed all guards and seized their firearms and ammunition.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=106}} They also released prisoners, many of whom joined ranks of the rebel army.{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=21}} This was too much for MacLeod and he resigned immediately after this event.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=283}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=107}}\n\nIn 1803, Wellesley left for Europe, after three years of inconclusive war with Pazhassi Raja, later destined to become Duke of Wellington, vanquisher of Napoleon at Waterloo.<ref name=\"Panikker\">Historical preface of Kerala Simham, Sardar KM Panikker, [1941], DC Books, 2008 Edition, Kottayam 686,001</ref>\n\nIn 1803, British had 8,147 soldiers to fight Pazhassi Raja. But as the situation was slipping out of control, British military command in Malabar requested for another 5,000 men. This reinforcement arrived in early 1804 and thus increasing British force to 13,000 men.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=70}}\n\nIn 1804, a large British army arrived and 1200 Kolkar were also ready for action.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=111}} Most importantly Thomas Hervey Baber, a civil servant was appointed as Sub-Collector.{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=35}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=112}} It was he who crushed Pazhassi's Revolt forever. It is indeed ironic that what a military genius like Wellesley could not attain, was achieved by Baber&nbsp;\u2013 said to be just a 'civil servant.' Baber had both a personal motive&nbsp;\u2013 to avenge the death of his friend Major Cameron, the first husband of his wife Helen Somerville Fearon at the hand of Pazhassi Raja on 9 January 1797 at Periya Pass. Baber became a civil servant to protect the interests of a small but influential group of merchants that included his in-laws&nbsp;\u2013 the Inglis and Money families of Bombay. It is noteworthy that Baber's son Henry Fearon Baber married the Granddaughter of George Harris, 1st Baron Srirangapattam and the nemesis of Tipu Sultan.\n\nIn 1804, a huge rising led by Kalyat Nambiar [a powerful Chirakkal noble but Raja's sympathiser] and Raja's men in largely forested eastern Chirakkal was crushed by British.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=111}}{{sfnp|Menon|2007|p=317}}{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=286}} If there was large and long revolt warfare in Chirakkal, it would have immensely profited Raja. Though there was a lot of supporters of Raja in Chirakkal, as revolt collapsed fast as rebels opted for open confrontation instead of time-honoured guerrilla warfare. Another cause for the failure of revolt was treacherous Kolkar also served their White pay-masters well.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nSo once more rebel force had retreated to Wayanad. They were hotly chased by British who had 2000 Sepoys and 1000 Kolkar. A reward of 3000 pagodas was offered for Raja along with 1000 Pagodas for Edachena Kungan and bounties were put on heads of 10 other associates of Raja.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nBut rebels, mostly Kurumbas, struck at Churikunji [?] in Wayanad.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=119}} Though they had to withdraw, they had devastated their enemy. That year, a party of Kolkar nearly caught Raja but he escaped thanks to timely warning of a Kurumba guard.{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=36}}\n\nBut monsoon and brutal climate of Wayanad soon aided Raja. Of 1300 Kolkar only 170 were not sick by October.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=120}} Raja and Edachena Kungan organised a large force of Kurichias and Kurumbas at Pulpally shrine and positioned them to as far as Kurichiyat.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=119}} Also, the effort of Kungan to rally Nayar nobles of Wayanad to support Raja's war-effort had also succeeded.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nBritish for past couple of years did not have to suffer the loss on a scale of Periya in 1797, but matters were not easy for British at all. Even in Kottayam which had become quiet might explode once more and a large rebel force with Raja as the head was still at large. But one must remember that the whole revolt is a one-man show as Wellesley himself remarked once-\u201c''We are not fighting 1000 men [Raja\u2019s army]&nbsp;... but one man&nbsp;... Kerala Varma''.\u201d-Raja's end would mean end of revolt.<ref name=\"Panikker\" />\n\n====Betrayal and death====\nT.H. Baber went to Mysore to direct operations himself and began a large search for informants and traitors. True, British themselves admit that they did not get a lot of informants as locals were devoted to Raja, but some of those few informants proved devastating to revolt-one of them a Chetti, found out where Raja had camped and informed Baber who took to field with 100 Kolkar and 50 Sepoys.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=121}}\n\nThere is one school of thought that blames Pazhayamviden Chandu as solely responsible for fall of Raja and end of his revolt.{{sfnp|Ramachandran|2008|p=95}} Pazhayamviden worked with British military authority as an \"adviser\" like Pallore Eman, but in reality, spied for Raja. But in autumn of 1805 Pazhayamviden decided to betray all military secrets of his master for a large sum of money.\n\nIn light of the above points, it will not be far-fetched to believe that Chetti who guided British troops to Raja's hideout mentioned by Baber in his letter could be a servant or agent of Pazhayamviden Chandu.\n\nOn 1805, 30 November, Raja and retainers were camped close to Karnataka on the shore of a stream named Mavila or Mavila Tod [not far from Pulpally]. Raja and party were caught by surprise and an intense but short fight followed. Six rebels were killed. One of the earliest rebels to be killed was Pazhassi Raja.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nBut evidently, wounded Raja did live long enough for a few more minutes to raise his loaded gun and then tell Canara Menon, an East India Company minor official, not to come too close to his dying body and pollute it.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=123}} Raja's contempt and sarcasm for a man who chose to serve unclean foreigner are evident. But it also showed his uncompromising stand towards collaborators and foreign invaders.\n\nThe precise nature of Raja's death is controversial.

Raja allied with Company initially not because he was a vassal of British, but because Mysore was enemy of both. Before 1792, Malabar suffered from rapacity of Mysore rule and British were only a merchant power who had not yet harmed people of Malabar. So it was understandable that many leaders of Malabar&nbsp;\u2013 Pazhassi Raja included&nbsp;\u2013 allied with British to fight Mysore rulers like Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=8}}\n\nSwaminatha Iyer, a British agent had noted as early as 1797 that extreme popularity of Raja was on account of the fact that he remained in his country with his subjects during Mysore invasions and shared with them the trials and tribulations and also due to his extreme generosity to this peasantry. It was on account of love and support from his subjects that Raja could evade and fight British for a decade even when he had a bounty on his head.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=130}}\n\nAfter his fellow Rajas in Malabar submitted to British after 1798, Raja himself knew well that he will be defeated and killed in the long run if he chose to fight English East India Company.

As part of this, he borrowed money from Tellicherry Factory and gave financial help to his peasants to resume agriculture along with distribution of seeds and cattle. This was in contrast to rest of Rajas of Malabar who squeezed peasants. This was one reason why his popularity with masses remained high.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=132}}\n\nRaja is also credited with the spread of agriculture in Wynad.

He was a warrior Hindu prince and de facto head of the kingdom of [[Kottayam (Malabar)|Kottayam]], otherwise known as Cotiote, in [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]], India, between 1774 and 1805. His struggles with the British [[East India Company]] is known as the [[Cotiote War]]. He is popularly known as '''''Kerala Simham''''' ('''''Lion of Kerala''''') on account of his martial exploits.\n\nPazhassi Raja was a member of the western branch of the Kottayam royal clan. When [[Hyder Ali]] of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] [[Mysore invasion of Kerala|occupied Malabar]] in 1773, the Raja of Kottayam found political asylum in [[Travancore]]. Pazhassi Raja, the fourth prince in line for succession to the throne during this period, became one of the ''de facto'' heads of state, surpassing several older royal contenders. He fought a war of resistance against the Mysorean army from 1774 to 1793. On account of his refusal to flee and due to his effective resistance to Mysoreans, he gained firm support of his subjects.\n\nIn 1792, after the [[Third Anglo-Mysore War]], the East India Company imposed control in Kottayam in violation of an earlier agreement of 1790 which had recognised its independence. [[Vira Varma]], to whom Raja was a nephew, was appointed by the East India Company authorities as the Raja of Kottayam. To meet revenue targets fixed by Company authorities, Vira Varma ordered an exorbitant tax to be collected from the peasantry and this move was met in 1793 by a mass resistance led by Pazhassi Raja, who had always been opposed to the Company's rule. In 1796, the Company made an attempt to arrest Pazhassi Raja, but he evaded capture and instead fought back using guerilla warfare. After a string of serious setbacks, the Company sued for peace in 1797. The conflict was renewed in 1800 over a dispute on Wayanad and after a five-year-long war of insurgency, Pazhassi Raja was killed on 30 November 1805 in a gun-fight at Mavila Thodu (small body of water), in the present day Kerala-Karnataka border.\n\n==Kingdom==\nPazhassi Raja was born in the Padinjare Kovilakam (Western Branch) of Purannattu Swarupam, Peralam Village, the royal clan of the kingdom of Kottayam in North Malabar not [[Kottayam]] District in south Kerala. This branch was located at Pazhassi which lay south west of [[Mattannur]]. Kerala Varma got the name Pazhassi Raja as he was a native of Pazhassi. The early British documents wrote ''Pazhassi Raja'' as ''Pychy Rajah'', while the name ''Cotiote Raja'' comes from the anglicizing of ''Kottayam'' to ''Cotiote''. Kottayam covers what is today the [[Thalassery]] taluk of the [[Kannur District]] and [[Wayanad district]], along with the [[Gudalur, Nilgiris|Gudalur]] taluk of [[Nilgiris district]].{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=24}}\n\nAs a royal clan, Purannattu Swarupam had three branches: a western branch (Padinjare Kovilakam) at Pazhassi, near Mattannur, an eastern branch (Kizhakke Kovilakam) at Manatana, near Peravoor, and a southern branch (Tekke Kovilakam) at Kottayampoil, near Koothuparamba.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Wayanad \u2013 Its People and Traditions by C. Gopalan Nair</ref>\n\n==Resistance to Mysore occupation (1773\u20131793)==\nPazhassi Raja's warfare with Mysore troops can be divided into two phases based on the rulers of the kingdom of Mysore. First phase lasted from 1773 to 1782 during which time, the Mysore ruler was [[Hyder Ali]]. The second phase extended from 1784 to 1793 and during this phase he fought the troops of [[Tipu Sultan]], son and successor of Hyder Ali.\n\n===Resistance to Hyder Ali (1773\u20131782)===\nIn 1773, Hyder Ali marched into Malabar for the second time,{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=295}} for non-payment of tributes from the Rajas (kings) of Malabar as agreed after war in 1768. Most of the ''Rajas'' of Malabar, along with many ''Naduvazhis'' or vassals fled to seek political asylum in Travancore. Princes and younger noblemen who refused to flee the invasion organised resistances. The Malabari partisans made excellent use of the wooded hills that covered most of Malabar during this rebellion.\n\nIn 1774, at the age of 21, Pazhassi Raja took over the throne to replace his uncle who had fled to Travancore. He vowed to resist Hyder Ali's troops, and stayed in Kottayam{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=13}} , where he gathered a force and began guerrilla battles against the troops of Mysore as he had neither guns nor troops enough to face them in an open battle. He set up a large number of bases in the nearly impenetrable forested mountains of Puralimala and Wynad and repeatedly inflicted severe minor losses on the Mysore army in Kottayam as well as in Wynad.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=58}}\n\nOnce the true Raja of Kottayam had fled, three royals rose to power in Kottayam. The nephew of the escaped Raja named [[Vira Varma]] and his nephews, Ravi Varma and Pazhassi Raja now took over the reins of government. Vira Varma was skilled in political intrigue and manipulation whereas Ravi Varma was too incompetent to play any serious political role and hence his role only was nominal. Pazhassi Raja become the most powerful figure in Kottayam, much to the chagrin of his uncle Vira Varma. Hence Vira Varma played a series of power games aiming to check the growing clout of his nephew. So the relation between Vira Varma and Pazhassi Raja was one of enmity right from the onset.\n\nThe military situation was grim for ''Pazhassi Raja'' and his troops&nbsp;\u2013 in 1774, [[Kodagu|Coorgs]] had joined hands with Hyder Ali on the promise of being gifted Wynad and a large Coorg army camped in Wynad to help Mysore troops. In 1776, Hyder Ali re-installed the Hindu Raja in Chirakkal {{sfnp|Menon|2007|p=295}} and the latter joined Mysore war effort to crush Pazhassi Raja.{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=13}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=24}} This triple alliance which lasted till 1780 reached nowhere near defeating the Kottayam army.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nDuring his long war with the Mysore and then the English East India Company, Pazhassi Raja increased his sphere of influence significantly eastwards as far as the outskirts of Mysore. His men regularly looted enemy treasuries and sandalwood from southern Karnataka and his enemies could do little to check these raids. This enabled him to lay claim on a great chunk of the Mysore district&nbsp;\u2013 as far as Nanjangod in the east. Also, Pazhassi Raja and his men frequently raided the domains of neighbouring Rajas in northern Malabar and Coorg to harass the enemy regiments posted there and he was often supported by local population of those territories. Along with this, he had close ties with [[Ravi Varma of Padinjare Kovilakam|Ravi Varma]] and [[Krishna Varma]], who were princes of Calicut and popular rebel leaders of southern Malabar.\n\n====Siege of Thalasseri====\n[[Thalassery|Thalasseri]] or Tellicherry in the late 18th century was a harbour-fort which was held by the British East India Company as a factory. The value of Tellicherry as a naval base meant that her capture could seriously impact the British naval situation on the west coast. Also rebels in North Malabar bought arms and ammunition from the British in Tellicherry. So if Hyder could capture this fort, he could, at a stroke, cripple both the rebels in North Malabar as well as the British military power at a regional basis.\n\nSo in 1778, Hyder's vassal, the Raja of Chirakkal, besieged Thalasseri and enforced an economic blockade under order from Hyder himself.{{sfnp|Menon|2007|p=296}} The British factories at Talassery armed Pazhassi Raja's men to enable them to recover Kottayam from the Mysorean occupation army. This move by the British ensured that the Chirakkal army was now at risk of being struck in the rear by Pazhassi Raja's force. The Chirakkal troops began to retreat, but Pazhassi chased and devastated the Chirakkal army, and then marched to Kottayam where he obliterated the Mysorean occupation and overran all of western Kottayam. But at this critical moment when the Mysorean army in Malabar could have been destroyed by a joint action on the part of the British and the Rajas, the British factories at Talassery were instructed by the Governor not to upset the nominal peace with Hyder.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nThus the British decision not to exploit the victory at Thalasseri was exploited by Mysore. The Chirakkal army reinforced by a Mysorean contingent under Balwant Rao marched into Kottayam. Pazhassi's men, though secretly supplied with arms and ammunition by the British, could not hold or defeat this huge host and soon the [[Kottayam (Malabar)|Kottayam]] army was forced to disperse after a fight. Then the Mysore-Chirakkal army captured Kadathanad and installed a puppet Raja who joined hands with Mysore. In 1779, a huge Mysore-Chirakkal-Kadathanad army besieged Thalasseri. Pazhassi Raja sent a force of 2000 Nairs to aid the British defence of Thalassery, and this enabled the factories to hold on successfully.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=27}}{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=14}}\n\nBy the end of 1779, Sardar Khan, the Mysorean general was sent to Thalasseri to bring the siege speedily to a successful conclusion.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=296}}{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=14}} Sardar Khan came with a force of 10,000 troops and 30 heavy guns.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Murland|first1=Lieutenant Colonel HF|title=Baillie-Ki-Paltan: A History of the 2nd Battalion, Madras Pioneers 1759 - 1930|date=2005|publisher=The Naval and Military Press Ltd|location=East Sussex|page=48}}</ref> Sardar Khan knew that it was Pazhassi Raja's help that enabled the British to resist him and so he opened negotiations with Pazhassi&nbsp;\u2013 his offer was the restoration of Mysore occupied territories of Kottayam if Pazhassi would ally himself with Mysore and pay an immediate tribute of 500,000 rupees. It was well beyond the capacity of Kottayam to raise so huge a sum in so short a time. But Pazhassi did his best to pay Sardar Khan [probably in the hope that the latter would make concessions] and 60,000 rupees was paid to the latter. But Khan was not satisfied and rejected Pazhassi's request that his possessions in Malabar be restored.{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=27}} This greedy and tactless approach of Sardar Khan's made sure that there was little chance for Mysore to capture Thalasseri. The Kottayam army became far stronger with their major victory in 1779 at Kalpetta (Wynad) where the whole Coorg army of 2,000 was surrounded and decimated by Pazhassi Raja's troops. The destruction of the Coorg army in Wynad enabled Raja to throw a whole new army into the contest at Thalasseri.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nIn 1780, Pazhassi Raja proposed a plan to the British to break the Mysorean siege of Thalassery: he and his men would strike the enemy in the rear from the east as the British came out of the fort and struck the Mysorean line in front. Both armies would effect a junction that would split the enemy into two. The Mysorean and allied troops could then be routed easily. But it was only in 1781 that the British understood the value of this plan and their Bombay authorities agreed to it. An operation was carried out as per Pazhassi's plan; it ended with the destruction of the Mysorean forces. Sardar Khan himself was killed. What followed was a rebellion in Kottayam by the Nayar militia led by Pazhassi Raja. Soon, the Mysoreans were ousted.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=28}}\n\n===Rebellion to remove Tipu Sultan (1784\u20131793)===\nBy 1782, Kottayam was once more a free land. But by the Treaty of Mangalore (1784) after the Second Anglo-Mysore War, the British recognised [[Tipu Sultan]]'s sphere of authority in Malabar. Thus with its only valuable ally lost, Kottayam was ready to become a vassal state of Mysore. Once more, as Sardar Khan did in 1779, Mysore exacted an exorbitant rate of tribute. Although Ravi Varma, the elder brother of Pazhassi Raja agreed to pay 65,000 rupees per year, Mysore demanded 81,000 rupees.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=28}} The hiked rate of tribute meant greater hardship for the peasantry (largely Tiyar/Izhava) who had suffered from years of foreign occupation. So Pazhassi Raja took up this issue and decided to launch a mass resistance struggle once more.<ref>Calicut University Text for paper Kerala History and Culture Distance Education MA History 2007 by Prof. SS Warrier</ref>{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=29}}\n\nWhat angered Pazhassi Raja even more was that his brother Ravi Varma who paid a visit to Tipu Sultan in 1786 for peace talks was forced to sign a treaty which ceded Wayanad to Tipu Sultan. Pazhassi Raja decided not to let Tipu enjoy Wayanad in peace and kept up a guerrilla warfare that constantly harassed Mysore troops in Wayanad and its neighbourhood. War in Wayanad lasted for seven years&nbsp;\u2013 till 1793&nbsp;\u2013 when the last of the Mysorean garrisons were expelled from the soil of Wayanad.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nBy the end of 1788, Pazhassi Raja's hatred of Tipu had shot up on account of the latter's policy of forcible conversion. So he strengthened his ties with the British on one hand and with fellow rebel chiefs and princes in Malabar on the other. Tipu sent an army under a French general named Lally with a genocidal mission\u2014the extermination of the [[Nair]] caste from Kottayam to Palakkad&nbsp;\u2013 as Tipu was determined to end the menace of Nair rebels in Malabar who had foiled all attempts of him and his late father Hyder Ali to subjugate and exploit Malabar.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=29}}\n\nThe senior Rajah of Kottayam fled to Travancore fearing the Sultan. But before that, he handed over charge of government to Pazhassi Raja and asked him to save the country from Mysore's onslaught. Given below is the observation made by historian Rajayyan about Pazhassi Raja's resistance to Tipu Sultan after the exodus of Rajas from Malabar in 1788:\n\n{{Quote|Between 1787 and 1788, the ''thampurans'' or Rajahs of Malabar, threatened by the forces of Tipu, fled to Travancore. Among them were the princes of Kottayathu.....The Senior Rajah before his flight summoned Kerala Varma, the youngest prince, and instructed him to protect the country. Accordingly, the latter assembled the inhabitants, retired to the jungles and assisted them in the development of a new homeland.  Frequently, in defiance to the authority of the Sultan, he with a band of determined followers issued forth from the woods and levied contributions.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=90}}}}\n\nBut in 1790, Tipu abandoned the war in Malabar as the war in Deccan drew his attention. Pazhassi Raja joined the British with a force of 1500 [[Nair]]s to capture the Mysorean stronghold in Katirur (near Talassery).{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=31}} After Katirur, Pazhassi Raja and his troops moved south-east and captured the Kuttiyadi fort from Tipu's men.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=32}} Thus once more, the whole of Kottayam was under the control of Pazhassi Raja.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=60}} In 1790, the British recognised Pazhassi Raja as the head of Kottayam instead of the original Raja who was in refuge at Travancore. Raja agreed to pay 25,000 rupees as tribute to the British. But his struggle with the Mysore troops continued in Wayanad till 1793 when he freed that land also.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nBut by the Treaty of Seringapatam (1792) signed between the British and Tipu after the latter failed in Third Anglo-Mysore War, Malabar was ceded to the British.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=60}}  The British then began to work for the establishment of their supremacy in Malabar.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} This was where the British and Pazhassi Raja had opposite opinions&nbsp;\u2013 Pazhassi Raja helped the British not because he was ready to accept British sovereignty but because he wanted his country Kottayam to be a free land.<ref>Evolution of Kerala History and Culture, Prof. T.

British called their wars with Pazhassi Rajah as Cotiote War\n\n===First revolt (1793\u20131797)===\n\nPazhassi Raja was not on good terms with his uncle Vira Varma, Raja of Kurumbranad. In 1793, foxy Vira Varma who had surrendered Kottayam to British back in 1792, convinced British Commissioners to let him collect tax in Kottayam.{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=16}} He calculated that a good collection might please the British and that that would let him seize all of Kottayam.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=38}} British had by this time adopted a hostile approach to Pazhassi Raja who had consistently refused to accept British suzerainty and hence they made obedient Vira Varma as head of Kottayam{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=60}} Pazhassi Raja was angry at this British move. He felt betrayed.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=91}} After all, he was the only Raja in Northern Malabar to have helped the British consistently in the war with Mysore.{{sfnp|Menon|2007|p=313}}\n\nVira Varma Raja, on the one hand, undertook to collect tax in Kottayam directly, but on the other hand, he instigated Pazhassi Raja to oppose the British. Moreover, the British assessment was harsh and beyond the peasants' capacity to pay. They resisted its forcible collection by the agents of the British, and Pazhassi Raja took up their cause. As seen before, Raja was deadly opposed to extortion of the peasantry.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=61}}\n\nIn 1793, Pazhassi Raja made sure that no tax was collected in Kottayam by the British&nbsp;\u2013 as a mark of his protest.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=60}} He also threatened that if British officials did not give up their enumeration of pepper vines, he would have the vines destroyed.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=91}} Local British authorities, however, debated with Raja and soon both discovered Vira Varma's dirty games. So the British put forward a solution acceptable to the Raja by which 20 percent of gross revenue would go to Raja and another 20 percent would go for the temples' expense. No tax would be imposed on temple property in the immediate future.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=42}}{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=29}}\n\nIn 1793, Tipu's Vakils protested to the British that Pazhassi Raja, who was a British tributary, had overrun most of Wayanad, still under Mysore. Soon the Raja was supreme in the Wayanad Plateau.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=36}}\n\nBut the Governor General unwisely revoked the agreement in 1794 and gave Kottayam to Kurumbranad Raja on a five-year lease.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=91}}{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=61}}{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=30}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=43}} The Raja was truly angry at this decision and decided to retaliate by ruling his country as per customary law. The year before the lease was concluded the Raja had provided asylum to a Nayar noble, Narangoli Nambiar belongs to the Iruvazinad royal clan, who had been declared an outlaw by British for the murder of three men who had killed his kinsman. The Raja's kind treatment of Nambiar irritated the British.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=62}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=45}} The British also became angry that the Raja impaled two robbers as per customary law.{{sfnp|Menon|2007|p=314}} British planned to arrest Raja for 'murder', but gave up the idea as the Raja had a bodyguard of 500 well armed Wayanad Nayars.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nIn 1795, even after a year, Vira Varma Raja got Kottayam on lease, he was not able to collect tax in Kottayam-thanks to his nephew Raja's determination.

For British no more pretexts were needed to arrest Raja. 300 men under Lieutenant James Gordon marched from Talassery and seized Raja's fortified house at Pazhassi-but Raja fled four days earlier to Manattana (near Kottiyur). Gordon plundered the palace where traditional treasure of Raja was kept.{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=30}}{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=92}} Raja was angry at this loot and sent a letter to Supervisor at Thalassery.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=62}}{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=314}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=48}}\n\nRaja was also angry that one of his former general named [[Pazhayamviden Chandu]] had become an agent of Kurumbranad Raja and what angered him even more than that was that this turn-coat had the audacity to boss him with Vira Varma's and British blessings.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Raja shifted his HQ to Purali Range and then into Wayanad. Raja then blocked all British communications between Wayanad and Low Malabar through Kuttiyadi Pass.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=48}} The British retaliated by cutting all communications between Raja and Low Malabar. But as they did not have enough troops to chase him they waited for reinforcements.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nThe British commandant was Colonel Dow, whom Raja knew well during Siege of Thalassery. So Raja thought that this old friend might help him mediate with the British government. Raja offered to give up the struggle provided he was pardoned and his treasure and house restored.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=92}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=49}} The Colonel and Raja being old soldiers hated needless bloodshed and so he forwarded Raja's request to Commissioners, who thought they were bitterly opposed to Raja's independent style, agreed to the Colonel's suggestion as there was a risk that Raja might ally with Tipu.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=92}}\n\nSo Northern Superintendent ordered the restoration of the Raja's house [but not treasure], and the Raja's pardon was confirmed by the Bombay and Supreme Governments.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=92}} But the orders of government were communicated to the Raja via Vira Varma&nbsp;\u2013 which meant that uncle Raja took care not to report to his nephew that the British had agreed to his requests. Uncle Raja had a vested interest in the war between the Company and his nephew Pazhassi Raja.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=49}}\n\nVira Varma also removed [[Kaitheri Ambu]], a favourite noble and general of Raja, from home administration of Kottayam. Ambu along with followers went to Kannavam [also spelled ''Kannavath'' and ''Kannoth''], where he planned and executed a mass resistance with people's support, which made sure that Vira Varma could make no tax collection in Kottayam. But Ambu acted clearly on guidance of Raja, who felt expulsion of Ambu was another of his uncle's conspiracies to undermine him.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nRaja feared that British planned to seize him [not knowing that their truce terms were kept blocked from him by his uncle] and retreated into depths of Wayanad. British troop build up in Wayanad also accelerated his doubts. However, Raja was still eager to avoid a war and came to meet Northern Superintendent with a bodyguard of 1500 armed Nayars. Vira Varma Raja was also ordered to be present. Pazhassi Raja's main demand was that Kottayam must be under his rule-a demand his uncle was not ready to accede.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nBritish Commissioners' attitude also was arrogant-they were already prejudiced towards Raja and so were blind towards Raja's logical argument that Vira Varma had no business in Kottayam. As talks broke down, Commissioners' issued a threat proclamation in Kottayam that if those Kottayam men in service of Raja does not desert him and come home, they would be declared enemies and their properties would be confiscated.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=314}}{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=92}} But this proclamation had little effect in Kottayam where resistance to British-Kurumbranad rule became stronger.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nBritish, to their horror, found out that a large number of Vira Varma's troops had deserted to join ranks of resisters{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=314}}{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=92}} and Vira Varma himself was not much interested to help British-after all his aim was to create a flare-up between his nephew and British for sake of pure self-interest.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nRaja then visited Mysorean commandant at Karkankotta in 1796{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=62}}{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=94}} and in 1797 held an audience with old enemy Tipu in Mysore who posted 6000 men at Karkankotta to aid Raja in case of war and also to supply ammunition to rebels<ref name=\"WFrancis103\">{{cite book |last1=W.

He also began to collect troops and armament. War was imminent. 1200 troops and artillery under Major General was sent by Bombay Government to deal with Pazhassi.

Partisan bands became active all over Kottayam and harassed reinforcements and supply convoys. Same was the case in Wayanad where British troops that moved out of the safety of block-houses risked being way-laid by Kurichia bowmen. British suffered good loss in terms of men, ammunition and stores in these ambuscades.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=314}}{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=95}}\n\n====Victory at Periya Pass====\n\nThis event was the most important in the whole war. In 1797, Colonel Dow & force marches into Wayanad. His plan was to block Periya Pass and then crush a large rebel force in Kannoth once their retreat is blocked.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nReinforcements under Lieutenant Mealy were to reach Dow at Periya, but on way they were severely harassed by a force of Nayars and Kurichias and suffered a casualty of 105 men. So instead of Periya they retreated to their original base.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=63}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=58}}\n\nDow's troops suffered chronic shortage of supplies and so Dow applied for reinforcements and re-supplies to be sent under Major Anderson of Bowles' regiment. But as Mappila guides of Anderson deserted at last moment. That caused a delay in journey of Anderson-a delay that had fatal consequence for British.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=59}}\n\nDow then received news that Tipu had sent sepoys to aid Raja as Tipu considered British entry into Wayanad a violation of Seringapatam Pact. Dow decided that he will go to Talassery to consult authorities there and to plan a greater operation to deal with troops of Raja and Tipu simultaneously in Wayanad. He left with a small band of men but was ambushed on way by Raja's men aided by Mysorean sepoys but Dow escaped unhurt.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=63}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=59}}\n\nThe day after he left, British force of 1100 under Major Cameroon in Periya decided to descend into Kottayam via Periya Pass as their supplies have exhausted.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=64}}\n\nBut what they did not know was that Raja who learned of the true state of British army laid a trap for them-he ordered troops lay concealed in camouflaged stockades built on both sides of the pass. Once the whole British force entered the narrow pass, hidden troops were to pounce on their enemy who must be caught unawares.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=314}}\n\nPlan worked well and what followed was great slaughter of British.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=95}}{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=64}}{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=19}} Had it not been for the arrival of Major Anderson's force the following day, hardly any would have survived due to lack of medical care. Most of the enemy were killed and all their guns, ammunition, baggage and cattle were plundered along with Union colours. Senior British officers like Major Cameroon, Lieutenant Nugent, Lieutenant Madge, and Lieutenant Rudderman were killed in action.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=60}}\n\nAround this time, Commissioners took a decision on the advice of Swaminatha Pattar, a Tamil Brahmin who was the minister of Zamorin that sowed the eventual downfall of Pazhassi Raja. They decided to raise an irregular force of local traitors to harass Pazhassi Raja.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=60}} This force was a forerunner of the Kolkar,{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=64}} who became infamous for their sycophancy to British and cruelty to resisters and people.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nBut for time being, Raja was in a strong position.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=64}}  On account of British disasters, Bombay Government sent a Committee of Government composed of men of highest ranks-Commander-In-Chief Lieutenant-General Stuart and Governor Jonathan Duncan.{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=32}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=60}}{{sfnp|Menon|2007|p=315}} They decided to make peace as they were anxious that guerrilla warfare in a mountainous and forested terrain could last long and that Raja might join forces with Tipu or French. They also decided that Kurumbranad Raja Vira Varma should be ousted from administration of Kottayam.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=60}} Rajas of Chirakkal and Parappanad acted as mediators in negotiation between Raja and British{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=32}}{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=95}} and a peace pact was signed between Pazhassi and British in 1797.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=315}}\n\nThe Treaty of 1797 agreed on following points:{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=95}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=64}}\n* Pazhassi Raja was to be 'pardoned'.\n* He will be returned his treasure.\n* He will be provided an annual allowance of 8000 rupees.\n* He will be given back his confiscated house at Pazhassi.\n* Ravi Varma, elder brother of Pazhassi Raja will be head of Kottayam.\n\nA pardon and restoration of property was also extended to Narangoli Nambiar of Iruvazinad.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=72}}\n\nThus Raja's efforts of four years ended in a political victory. Peace dawned after four years of antagonism and war.\n\nTipu Sultan in his letter to French government notes with glee that British had lost 1,000 European soldiers and 3,000 native sepoys in four years of war between British troops and Kottayam army.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=60}}{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=20}}\n\n===Undeclared hostilities (1797-1800)===\n\nDespite the peace treaty of 1797, real peace did not emerge between Pazhassi Raja and English East India Company. Skirmishes continued across Kottayam. The main reason for this was that the Company did not attempt to end its efforts to subjugate Kottayam and collect tax. But this was successfully foiled by partisans of Pazhassi Raja headed by Kaitheri Ambu.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=77}} Pazhassi Raja also went ahead with his policy of defiance of English directions, continued with his military enlargement program and even shifted his seat of power to Mananthavadi in Wayanad - all of which were deemed as \"injurious to interests of Company in Kottayam\" by Colonel Dow, English representative in Kottayam. But since Raja clearly had the upper hand since the victory of 1797, English was powerless to put an end to his activities.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=73}}\n\n===Second revolt and death (1800\u20131805)===\n\nAfter the fall of Tipu, Wayanad fell to the British. They sent a Mysore Commission to seize Wayanad and planned to annex it to either Canara or Coimbatore.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=78}} But as Wayanad was a traditional possession of Kottayam Raja and that Pazhassi is in control of this region since 1793, Pazhassi correctly saw move was an encroachment on his country's ancient provinces. Raja retaliated by collecting a large force of Nayars which was now supplemented by Mappilas and Pathans,{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=83}} latter being ex-soldiers of Tipu who became unemployed after Tipu's death.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=315}}\n\nBritish Government at Madras appointed Major General [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]] as British army commandant of Mysore, Canara & Malabar.\n\nHe planned a double-pronged move from Malabar Coast and Mysore into Wayanad and began preparations for that end.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=83}} Raja observed Major General-latter had brought reinforcements and building roads in Wayanad and outposts across rebel country. In response, Raja also recruited numerous men which so alarmed Wellesley that latter even wanted to kidnap kith and kin of rebels so as to check Raja's recruitment.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}\n\nRaja learned that Wellesley had left to Deccan on a military mission-Raja who understood that Major General's absence is a great chance swiftly made his move. He marched across Kuttiyadi Pass and below he made a junction with Unni Mootha Mooppan, a Walluvanad Mappila leader & his men and soon several great nobles like Kampuratt Nambiar of Iruvazhinad, Peruvayal Nambiar and [[Kannavath Sankaran Nambiar]] also joined Raja with their men.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=84}}{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=175}}{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=66}}\n\nBy monsoon of 1800, rebels who controlled all of country-side of Kottayam threatened to overwhelm British outposts in Kottayam.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=315}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=85}} Wellesley sent a large force under Colonel Sartorius to recapture rebel-held Kottayam.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=175}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=85}} But the plan could not be carried out as there were not enough troops in Malabar. Wellesley advised Commissioners to stop all communications with Wayanad so as to starve Raja of supplies.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=89}} But the shortage of troops also meant this plan too remained on paper. By the time, Wellesley decided to smash Raja by a double drive from Malabar Coast and Mysore into Wayanad, Manjeri Athan Gurikkal an Ernad Mappila leader along with his followers agreed to support of Raja.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nBy 1801, a large British force of over 10,000 men swarmed all over Kottayam and Wayanad and they blocked all passes that linked Wayanad{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=68}} with Malabar. Before so large numbers, rebels thought wise to go under-ground for time being.

British also threatened brutal penalty and confiscation of property for all those rebels who failed to surrender in six weeks time. But a pardon was also issued for surrendered rebels. But none of these threats and temptations worked and Raja was still at large. But some of his chief supporters were arrested of whom Kannavath Sankaran Nambiar was most famous. Kannavath Sankaran Nambiar and his son were hanged too and their property was confiscated.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=316}}{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=192}}{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=34}}\n\nFollowing murder of Kannavath Nambiar, a deceptive calm descended on North Malabar-calm before the storm. Collector Major MacLeod believed that war was over and went ahead with exploitation program. He immediately declared total disarmament of Malabar{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=101}} and threatened those who kept arms with the death penalty. He also doubled the rate of tax and ordered a reassessment of tax of whole Malabar in a mere forty days.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=316}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=103}}{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=282}}\n\nAll these 'reforms' paid back in 1803 when Malabar was on verge of revolt as people were pushed to wall.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=316}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=103}} MacLeod tried to calm this with corrective measure-He cancelled all his 'reforms' and old system was reinstated. But it was too late for Wayanad where Raja's men were prepared for a rebellion.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n====Capture of Panamaram Fort====\n[[Image:Moat around Panamaram fort site.JPG|thumb|250px|Remains of the Moat surrounded the Panamaram British fort site. Now it is almost covered with creepers and bushes, Panamaram, [[Wayanad district|Wayanad]], Kerala.]]\n[[Image:Koli tree near Panamaram fort site.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Koli tree near Panamaram British fort site. Talakkal Chandu was executed somewhere near this tree.,Panamaram, [[Wayanad district|Wayanad]], Kerala.]]\nThe first major event was the capture of [[Panamaram]] Fort. Edachena Kungan Nair planned the operation and was helped by 150 Kurichia bowmen under Talakkal Chandu. Fort had 70 men under Captain Dickenson and there was a large force of 360 men under Major Drummond only a few miles away in Pulinjali.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=103}} So if Major came to help Captain in time Kurichia force would be overwhelmed by gun-fire and numbers. But Kungan and Chandu decided to take risk.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nThe whole garrison was slaughtered in the surprise attack led by the two generals and they lost only 5 dead and 10 wounded. Dickenson himself was killed.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=69}}{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=21}} Rebels got 112 muskets, six boxes of ammunition and 6000 rupees. They also destroyed the whole fort.(The remains of the fort can be seen now near Panamaram High School).{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=283}}\n\nWellesley was enraged at this rebel audacity and dispatched 500 men to retaliate. But by then rebel victory had roused all of Wayanad and Kottayam.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=316}} Edachena Kungan, the hero of Panamaram success, went to Pulpally shrine and issued a proclamation to people to join Raja's war.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=282}} 3000 men volunteered.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=69}}  They were posted at Valliyurkav at Mananthavadi, Motimjarra [?], and Edappally and 100 of them under the brother of Kungan posted themselves at Periya Pass and 25 men were posted at Kottiyur Pass. Rebel outposts were set up en route from Dindimal to Valliyurkav. The rebel army was mostly composed of archers and swordmen, but some had muskets.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=104}}\n\nEdachena Kungan Nair led an attack on a British detachment headed from Mysore to Mananthavadi. The harassment began once this force entered Wayanad till it reached a stream between Manathavadi and Bhavully river. There they were blocked by a rebel force entrenched on the opposite side of the stream. But to ill luck of rebels, a reinforcement which had caught up with blocked British army outflanked the rebel entrenchment and took a large number of prisoners. All these prisoners were disarmed and marched to a road where they were murdered.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nBesides, British reinforcements arrived in Wayanad from all directions. But British could find rebels nowhere.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=316}}\n\nThe rebels now concentrated in Kottayam. In 1802, they raided a supplies convoy near Kottiyur.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=69}}  British were frustrated by Kottayam people's total lack of co-operation. To add to their trouble, in 1803, a rebel force took to field in Kurumbranad* & Payyormala*{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=283}} and people were sympathetic to rebels.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=106}} Kungan marched towards Pazhassi to wipe out the British outpost there but had to retreat, though British suffered serious losses. Soon rebellion spread into Chirakkal where armed bands of partisans launched operations and often fought British openly. Raja's army by end of 1803 was ranging as far as Kannur and Thalasseri.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=316}}{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=21}}{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=283}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=111}}{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=70}} An estimated 3350 partisans of Pazhassi Raja took part in this operation that extended south as far as Ernad.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=69}}\n\nIn March 1803, a rebel force marched as far as Calicut and captured Sub-Jail where they killed all guards and seized their firearms and ammunition.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=106}} They also released prisoners, many of whom joined ranks of the rebel army.{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=21}} This was too much for MacLeod and he resigned immediately after this event.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=283}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=107}}\n\nIn 1803, Wellesley left for Europe, after three years of inconclusive war with Pazhassi Raja, later destined to become Duke of Wellington, vanquisher of Napoleon at Waterloo.<ref name=\"Panikker\">Historical preface of Kerala Simham, Sardar KM Panikker, [1941], DC Books, 2008 Edition, Kottayam 686,001</ref>\n\nIn 1803, British had 8,147 soldiers to fight Pazhassi Raja. But as the situation was slipping out of control, British military command in Malabar requested for another 5,000 men. This reinforcement arrived in early 1804 and thus increasing British force to 13,000 men.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=70}}\n\nIn 1804, a large British army arrived and 1200 Kolkar were also ready for action.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=111}} Most importantly Thomas Hervey Baber, a civil servant was appointed as Sub-Collector.{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=35}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=112}} It was he who crushed Pazhassi's Revolt forever. It is indeed ironic that what a military genius like Wellesley could not attain, was achieved by Baber&nbsp;\u2013 said to be just a 'civil servant.' Baber had both a personal motive&nbsp;\u2013 to avenge the death of his friend Major Cameron, the first husband of his wife Helen Somerville Fearon at the hand of Pazhassi Raja on 9 January 1797 at Periya Pass. Baber became a civil servant to protect the interests of a small but influential group of merchants that included his in-laws&nbsp;\u2013 the Inglis and Money families of Bombay. It is noteworthy that Baber's son Henry Fearon Baber married the Granddaughter of George Harris, 1st Baron Srirangapattam and the nemesis of Tipu Sultan.\n\nIn 1804, a huge rising led by Kalyat Nambiar [a powerful Chirakkal noble but Raja's sympathiser] and Raja's men in largely forested eastern Chirakkal was crushed by British.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=111}}{{sfnp|Menon|2007|p=317}}{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=286}} If there was large and long revolt warfare in Chirakkal, it would have immensely profited Raja. Though there was a lot of supporters of Raja in Chirakkal, as revolt collapsed fast as rebels opted for open confrontation instead of time-honoured guerrilla warfare. Another cause for the failure of revolt was treacherous Kolkar also served their White pay-masters well.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nSo once more rebel force had retreated to Wayanad. They were hotly chased by British who had 2000 Sepoys and 1000 Kolkar. A reward of 3000 pagodas was offered for Raja along with 1000 Pagodas for Edachena Kungan and bounties were put on heads of 10 other associates of Raja.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nBut rebels, mostly Kurumbas, struck at Churikunji [?] in Wayanad.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=119}} Though they had to withdraw, they had devastated their enemy. That year, a party of Kolkar nearly caught Raja but he escaped thanks to timely warning of a Kurumba guard.{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=36}}\n\nBut monsoon and brutal climate of Wayanad soon aided Raja. Of 1300 Kolkar only 170 were not sick by October.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=120}} Raja and Edachena Kungan organised a large force of Kurichias and Kurumbas at Pulpally shrine and positioned them to as far as Kurichiyat.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=119}} Also, the effort of Kungan to rally Nayar nobles of Wayanad to support Raja's war-effort had also succeeded.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nBritish for past couple of years did not have to suffer the loss on a scale of Periya in 1797, but matters were not easy for British at all. Even in Kottayam which had become quiet might explode once more and a large rebel force with Raja as the head was still at large. But one must remember that the whole revolt is a one-man show as Wellesley himself remarked once-\u201c''We are not fighting 1000 men [Raja\u2019s army]&nbsp;... but one man&nbsp;... Kerala Varma''.\u201d-Raja's end would mean end of revolt.<ref name=\"Panikker\" />\n\n====Betrayal and death====\nT.H. Baber went to Mysore to direct operations himself and began a large search for informants and traitors. True, British themselves admit that they did not get a lot of informants as locals were devoted to Raja, but some of those few informants proved devastating to revolt-one of them a Chetti, found out where Raja had camped and informed Baber who took to field with 100 Kolkar and 50 Sepoys.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=121}}\n\nThere is one school of thought that blames Pazhayamviden Chandu as solely responsible for fall of Raja and end of his revolt.{{sfnp|Ramachandran|2008|p=95}} Pazhayamviden worked with British military authority as an \"adviser\" like Pallore Eman, but in reality, spied for Raja. But in autumn of 1805 Pazhayamviden decided to betray all military secrets of his master for a large sum of money.\n\nIn light of the above points, it will not be far-fetched to believe that Chetti who guided British troops to Raja's hideout mentioned by Baber in his letter could be a servant or agent of Pazhayamviden Chandu.\n\nOn 1805, 30 November, Raja and retainers were camped close to Karnataka on the shore of a stream named Mavila or Mavila Tod [not far from Pulpally]. Raja and party were caught by surprise and an intense but short fight followed. Six rebels were killed. One of the earliest rebels to be killed was Pazhassi Raja.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nBut evidently, wounded Raja did live long enough for a few more minutes to raise his loaded gun and then tell Canara Menon, an East India Company minor official, not to come too close to his dying body and pollute it.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=123}} Raja's contempt and sarcasm for a man who chose to serve unclean foreigner are evident. But it also showed his uncompromising stand towards collaborators and foreign invaders.\n\nThe precise nature of Raja's death is controversial. Folklore insists that he committed suicide by swallowing a diamond ring to avoid capture after he was wounded{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=15}} but Baber says he was killed by a clerk named Canara Menon.{{cn|date=April 2017}} W. J. Wilson, who wrote on the history of the Madras Regiment, credits Captain Clafam and his six sepoys for killing. This third version is more likely as Baber was not on good terms with military authority throughout the war. He is alleged to have credited Menon so as to deny credit to Clafam and his superior Colonel Hill.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=126}}\n\nKunjani, the wife of Raja who was taken the prisoner, committed suicide in captivity at Kappanaveedu, near Thalassery. As reprisal on his family, property was confiscated and the palace at Pazhassi was demolished and replaced with a highway.{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=27}}{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=52}}{{sfnp|Ramachandran|2008|p=95}} The sorry state of his family aroused sympathy in local Thiyyas, who were loyal followers and built a new house for his family.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Elayavoor|first1=Vanidas|title=Vadakkan Aitihyamala|date=2002|publisher=Current Books|location=Kottayam|isbn=8124003963|page=108|edition=4th}}</ref>\n\n==Assessment==\n\n{{Quote|...but in all classes, I observed a decided interest for the Pyche Raja, towards whom the inhabitants entertained regard and respect bordering on veneration, which not even his death can efface.|Thomas Harvey Baber, 1805{{sfnp|Ramachandran|2008|p=95}}}}\n* Descriptive account of Pazhassi Raja as early as 1775 confirm his later day image as a courageous warrior committed to the freedom of his country.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=9}}\n* Walter Ivor, a member of Court of Directors, who had taken part in negotiations with Pazhassi Raja in 1797 notes that British losses that year in Cotiote War exceeded British losses in Third Anglo-Mysore War.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=126}}\n* War waged by Pazhassi Raja was the longest anti-British resistance struggle in India{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=126}} and forest warfare waged by Raja had no parallel in the history of India in late eighteenth and early nineteenth century India.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=127}}\n* British military command always wondered at the logistics of Raja's army. How he organized supplies for his several thousand strong armies remained a puzzle for them{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=127}}\n* To fight overwhelmingly superior enemies, Raja imparted military training to his peasantry wholesale and recruited them into his military force. This military policy of wholesale militarization was novel in the history of pre-modern Kerala. His war-effort was marked by the participation of members of all creeds, classes, and castes who took up arms due to his inspiration. Nobles, headmen, peasants, shopkeepers, merchants, artisans, and forest tribes rallied to fight the foreign invaders&nbsp;\u2014 first Mysore and later English East India Company.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=127}}\n* British losses were severe in terms of men and ran into several thousand. Death toll was particularly high with officers of commissioned ranks. So high were the losses suffered by Bombay army regiments that operated in North Malabar that they had to be withdrawn in 1803 fearing that further losses would cripple Bombay Army as a respectable body of troops.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=127}}\n* Raja shared all the privations of his ordinary soldiers during the war and took part in all major military action exposing himself to personal danger. On account of these attributes, he commanded great respect of his troops.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=71}}\n* Royal regiments from Britain also took part in Cotiote War along with Company troops.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=128}} \n* Anti-British rebels in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka also were allied to Pazhassi Raja.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=128}}\n* Arthur Wellesely, Duke of Wellington adopted methods of guerrilla warfare used by Pazhassi Raja to defeat Napoleon's armies in Spain.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Menon|first1=A Sreedhara|title=Kerala History and its Makers|date=2016|publisher=DC Books|location=Kottayam|isbn=978-81-264-2199-2|page=174}}</ref>\n* Memory of Pazhassi Raja and his struggle inspired freedom struggle in 20th century Kerala.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=129}}\n\nPazhassi Raja had no selfish motive of personal power. Kurup (1988) describes him as an altruistic personality who upheld interests of his subjects and country over his personal interest.  He believed that he was duty-bound to protect his subjects from exploitation and oppression.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=130}} Frenz (2008) also supports this view and opines that Raja was committed to the welfare of his people and freedom of his country. She notes that Pazhassi Raja opted for fight British when it became clear to him that English East India Company would not respect freedom of his country and welfare of his subjects. She noted that Raja considered it a personal failure as a leader if he failed to uphold sovereignty of his kingdom.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Frenz|first1=Margaret|editor1-last=Fischer-Tine|editor1-first=Harald|editor2-last=Mann|editor2-first=Michael|title=Colonialism as Civilizing Mission: Cultural Ideology in British India|date=2004|publisher=Wimbledon Publishing Company|location=London|isbn=1843310929|page=64|chapter=A Race of Monsters: South India and British 'Civilizing Mission' in Later Eighteenth Century}}</ref>\n\nCriticism leveled against Raja for allying with English East India Company during his wars with Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan is not rational in light of an analysis of contemporary South Indian history. Raja allied with Company initially not because he was a vassal of British, but because Mysore was enemy of both. Before 1792, Malabar suffered from rapacity of Mysore rule and British were only a merchant power who had not yet harmed people of Malabar. So it was understandable that many leaders of Malabar&nbsp;\u2013 Pazhassi Raja included&nbsp;\u2013 allied with British to fight Mysore rulers like Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=8}}\n\nSwaminatha Iyer, a British agent had noted as early as 1797 that extreme popularity of Raja was on account of the fact that he remained in his country with his subjects during Mysore invasions and shared with them the trials and tribulations and also due to his extreme generosity to this peasantry. It was on account of love and support from his subjects that Raja could evade and fight British for a decade even when he had a bounty on his head.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=130}}\n\nAfter his fellow Rajas in Malabar submitted to British after 1798, Raja himself knew well that he will be defeated and killed in the long run if he chose to fight English East India Company. But yet he refused to compromise. In a letter to Kalyat Kuttieman, he reveals his intent to resist English power to the end.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=130}}\n\nHe took initiative to rebuild his country which was devastated by Mysore invasions. As part of this, he borrowed money from Tellicherry Factory and gave financial help to his peasants to resume agriculture along with distribution of seeds and cattle. This was in contrast to rest of Rajas of Malabar who squeezed peasants. This was one reason why his popularity with masses remained high.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=132}}\n\nRaja is also credited with the spread of agriculture in Wynad. He started a program that encouraged tribesmen in Wynad to adopt settled agriculture. As part of this program, he instructed his vassals in Wynad to distribute cattle and seeds to tribesmen in Wynad.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=132}}\n\n==Supporters==\n\nPazhassi Raja was assisted by eighty chieftains during his wars and some were entrusted with administrative responsibilities also. Most prominent of them are Chengoteri Chathu, [[Pallur Eman]], Kaitheri Ambu, [[Kannavath Sankaran Nambiar|Kannavath Nambiar]], [[Thalakkal Chanthu|Thalakkal Chandu]] and [[Edachena Kunkan]].{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=103}}\n\n==Forest forts==\n\nIn his decades-long war to oust invaders, Rajah developed an elaborate system of cantonments and forts in the jungly and mountainous part of his country.\n\nFour of them are most important&nbsp;\u2013 granite fort on Purali range [modern Muzhakunnu] which was built by his ancestor Harischandra Perumal over a thousand years ago. He had another granite fort at Manatana. In Wynad, he had a great fort in Mananthavady which was reported to have ability to house his whole army of 6000 men. He also had a stronghold in Todikulam near Kannavam which belonged to his supporter Kannavath Sankaran.\n\nOf all his strongholds, none survive today. Only ruins of Purali fort survive today. It is today a heap of granite boulders. Only a tank still survives today.

The [[Prevention of Violence Act 1939]] was brought in response to an Irish Republican Army (IRA) campaign of violence under the [[S-Plan]]. This act had been allowed to expire in 1953 and was repealed in 1973 to be replaced by the [[Prevention of Terrorism Acts]] a response to [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland. From 1974 to 1989 the temporary provisions of the act were renewed annually.\n* In 2000 the Acts were replaced with the more permanent [[Terrorism Act 2000]], which contained many of their powers, and then the [[Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005]].\n* The [[Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001]] was formally introduced into the Parliament November 19, 2001 two months after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] in the United States. It received royal assent and went into force on December 13, 2001. On December 16, 2004 the Law Lords ruled that Part 4 was incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, but under the terms of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] it remained in force. The [[Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005]] was drafted to answer the Law Lords ruling and the [[Terrorism Act 2006]] creates new offences related to terrorism, and amends existing ones. The Act was drafted in the aftermath of the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]], and like its predecessors some of its terms have proven to be highly controversial.\n\nSince 1978 the UK's terrorism laws have been regularly reviewed by a security-cleared [[Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation]], whose often influential reports are submitted to Parliament and published in full.\n;{{US}}\n* U.S. legal issues surrounding this issue include rulings on the domestic employment of [[deadly force]] by law enforcement organizations.\n* Search and seizure is governed by the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].\n* The U.S. passed the [[USA PATRIOT Act]] after the September 11 attacks, as well as a range of other legislation and [[executive orders]] relating to national security.\n* The [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] was established to consolidate domestic security agencies to coordinate anti-terrorism, as well as national response to major natural disasters and accidents.\n* The [[Posse Comitatus Act]] limits domestic employment of the [[United States Army]] and the [[United States Air Force]], requiring Presidential approval prior to deploying the Army and/or the Air Force. [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] policy also applies this limitation to the [[United States Marine Corps]] and the [[United States Navy]], because the Posse Comitatus Act does not cover naval services, even though they are federal military forces. The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] can be employed domestically on Presidential order, as was done during the [[Los Angeles riots of 1992]], [[Hurricane Katrina]], and the [[Beltway Sniper]] incidents.\n* External or international use of lethal force would require a [[Presidential finding]].\n* In February 2017, sources claimed that the Trump administration intends to rename and revamp the U.S. government program [[Countering Violent Extremism Task Force|Countering Violent Extremism]] (CVE) to solely focus on Islamist extremism.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-extremists-program-exclusiv-idUSKBN15G5VO Exclusive: Trump to focus counter-extremism program solely on Islam - sources], Reuters 2017-02-02</ref>\n\n; {{AUS}}\n* Australia has passed several anti-terrorism acts. In 2004, a bill comprising three acts [[Australian anti-terrorism legislation, 2004|Anti-terrorism Act, 2004, (No 2) and (No 3)]] was passed. Then Attorney-General, [[Philip Ruddock]], introduced the ''Anti-terrorism bill, 2004'' on March 31. He described it as ''\"a bill to strengthen Australia's counter-terrorism laws in a number of respects&nbsp;\u2013 a task made more urgent following the recent tragic [[11 March 2004 Madrid attacks|terrorist bombings in Spain]].\"'' He said that Australia's counter-terrorism laws \"require review and, where necessary, updating if we are to have a legal framework capable of safeguarding all Australians from the scourge of terrorism.\" The [[Australian Anti-Terrorism Act 2005]] supplemented the powers of the earlier acts. The Australian legislation allows police to detain suspects for up to two weeks without charge and to electronically track suspects for up to a year. The [[Australian Anti-Terrorism Act 2005#The \"Shoot to Kill\" Clause|Australian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2005]] included a \"shoot-to-kill\" clause.

[[Amnesty International]] included a section on confronting terrorism in the recommendations in the Madrid Agenda arising from the Madrid Summit on Democracy and Terrorism (Madrid March 8\u201311, 2005):\n\n{{quote|Democratic principles and values are essential tools in the fight against terrorism. Any successful strategy for dealing with terrorism requires terrorists to be isolated. Consequently, the preference must be to treat terrorism as criminal acts to be handled through existing systems of law enforcement and with full respect for human rights and the rule of law. We recommend: (1) taking effective measures to make impunity impossible either for acts of terrorism or for the abuse of human rights in counter-terrorism measures. (2) the incorporation of human rights laws in all anti-terrorism programmes and policies of national governments as well as international bodies.\"<ref name=\"Amnesty International 2005\">Amnesty International (2005): \"Counter-terrorism and criminal law in the EU. [https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/ior61/013/2005/en/ online]</ref>}}\n\nWhile international efforts to combat terrorism have focused on the need to enhance cooperation between states, proponents of human rights (as well as [[human security]]) have suggested that more effort needs to be given to the effective inclusion of human rights protection as a crucial element in that cooperation. They argue that international human rights obligations do not stop at borders and a failure to respect human rights in one state may undermine its effectiveness in the international effort to cooperate to combat terrorism.<ref name=\"Human Rights News 2004\">Human Rights News (2004): \"Human Rights and Counter-Terrorism\", in the Briefing to the 60th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights. [http://hrw.org/english/docs/2004/01/29/global7127.htm online]</ref>\n\n=== Preemptive neutralization ===\nSome countries see preemptive attacks as a legitimate strategy. This includes capturing, killing, or disabling suspected terrorists before they can mount an attack. [[Israel]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], and [[Russia]] have taken this approach, while Western European states generally do not.\n\nAnother major method of preemptive neutralization is [[interrogation]] of known or suspected terrorists to obtain information about specific plots, targets, the identity of other terrorists, whether or not the interrogation subjects himself is guilty of terrorist involvement. Sometimes more extreme methods are used to increase [[suggestibility]], such as [[sleep deprivation]] or drugs. Such methods may lead captives to offer false information in an attempt to stop the treatment, or due to the confusion brought on by it. These methods are not tolerated by European powers. In 1978 the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled in the [[Ireland v. United Kingdom (1978)|Ireland v. United Kingdom]] case that [[five techniques|such methods]] amounted to a practice of inhuman and degrading treatment, and that such practices were in breach of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] Article 3 (art. 3).\n\n==== Non-military ====\nThe [[human security]] paradigm outlines a non-military approach which aims to address the enduring underlying inequalities which fuel terrorist activity. Causal factors need to be delineated and measures implemented which allow equal access to resources and [[sustainability]] for all people. Such activities empower citizens providing 'freedom from fear' and 'freedom from want'.\n\nThis can take many forms including the provision of clean drinking water, education, vaccination programs, provision of food and shelter and protection from violence, military or otherwise. Successful human security campaigns have been characterized by the participation of a diverse group of actors including governments, [[NGOs]], and citizens.\n\n[[Foreign internal defense]] programs provide outside expert assistance to a threatened government. FID can involve both non-military and military aspects of counter-terrorism.\n\nA 2017 study found that \"governance and civil society aid is effective in dampening domestic terrorism, but this effect is only present if the recipient country is not experiencing a civil conflict.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Foreign Aid as a Counterterrorism Tool - Burcu Savun, Daniel C.

That was the main stated justification for the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|U.S. invasion of Afghanistan]]. It was also a stated justification for the [[second Russian invasion of Chechnya]].\n\nMilitary intervention has not always been successful in stopping or preventing future terrorism, like during the [[Malayan Emergency]], the [[Mau Mau uprising]], and most of the campaigns against the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] during the [[Irish Civil War]], the [[S-Plan]], the [[Border Campaign (IRA)]] and [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland.

Local [[firefighter]]s and emergency medical personnel (often called \"first responders\") have plans for mitigating the effects of terrorist attacks, although police may deal with threats of such attacks.\n\n=== Target-hardening ===\n\nWhatever the target of terrorists, there are multiple ways of hardening the targets to prevent the terrorists from hitting their mark, or reducing the damage of attacks. One method is to place [[Hostile vehicle mitigation]] to enforce protective standoff distance outside tall or politically sensitive buildings to prevent car and [[truck bomb]]ing. Another way to reduce the impact of attacks is to design buildings for rapid evacuation.<ref>{{cite journal\n | author = Ronchi, E.\n | title = Disaster management: Design buildings for rapid evacuation\n | year = 2015\n | journal = Nature\n | volume = 528\n | issue = 7582\n | pages = 333\n | doi=10.1038/528333b\n | pmid=26672544\n| bibcode = 2015Natur.528..333R\n }}</ref>\n\nAircraft cockpits are kept locked during flights, and have reinforced doors, which only the pilots in the cabin are capable of opening.

The [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]] purchased bomb-resistant barriers after the [[September 11 terrorist attacks]].\n\n[[File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - Iron Dome Intercepts Rockets from the Gaza Strip.jpg|thumb|[[Iron Dome]] air defense system. It intercepts artillery rockets fired by terrorist onto Israeli cities and towns.]]\nAs [[Israel]] is suffering from constant shelling of its cities, towns and settlements by [[artillery rocket]]s from the [[Gaza Strip]] (mainly by [[Hamas]], but also by other Palestinian factions) and [[Lebanon]] (mainly by [[Hezbollah]]), Israel developed several defensive measures against artillery, rockets and missiles. These include building a [[bomb shelter]] in every building and [[school]], but also deploying active protection systems like the [[Arrow (Israeli missile)|Arrow ABM]], [[Iron Dome]] and [[David's Sling]] batteries which intercept the incoming threat in the air. [[Iron Dome]] has successfully intercepted hundreds of [[Qassam rocket]]s and [[Grad rocket]]s fired by Palestinians from the Gaza Strip.\n\nA more sophisticated target-hardening approach must consider industrial and other critical industrial infrastructure that could be attacked. Terrorists need not import chemical weapons if they can cause a major industrial accident such as the [[Bhopal disaster]] or the [[Halifax Explosion]]. Industrial chemicals in manufacturing, shipping, and storage need greater protection, and some efforts are in progress.<ref>{{cite journal\n | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A64224-2005Jan10.html\n | title = D.C.

Industrial shipments of chlorine, widely used in water purification and the chemical industry, travel in 90 or 55 ton tank cars.\n\nTo give one more example, the North American electrical grid has already demonstrated, in the [[Northeast Blackout of 2003]], its vulnerability to natural disasters coupled with inadequate, possibly insecure, [[SCADA]] (supervisory control and data acquisition) networks. Part of the vulnerability is due to deregulation leading to much more interconnection in a grid designed for only occasional power-selling between utilities. A small number of terrorists, attacking key power facilities when one or more engineers have infiltrated the power control centers, could wreak havoc.\n\nEquipping likely targets with containers (i.e., bags) of pig lard has been utilized to discourage attacks by suicide bombers. The technique was apparently used on a limited scale by British authorities in the 1940s.<ref>{{cite journal\n | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3484277.stm\n | title = Suicide bombing 'pig fat threat\n | date = February 13, 2004\n | accessdate=January 2, 2010\n | journal=BBC News}}</ref> The approach stems from the idea that Muslims perpetrating the attack would not want to be \"soiled\" by the lard in the moment prior to dying. The idea has been suggested more recently as a deterrent to suicide bombings in Israel.<ref>{{cite journal\n | url = http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/57793\n | title = Swine: Secret Weapon Against Islamic Terror?\n | date = December 9, 2007\n | journal = ArutzSheva\n}}</ref> However, the actual effectiveness of this tactic is probably limited as it is possible that a sympathetic Islamic scholar could issue a [[fatwa]] proclaiming that a suicide bomber would not be polluted by the swine products.\n\n=== Command and control ===\nIn North America and other continents, for a threatened or completed terrorist attack, the [[Incident Command System]] (ICS) is apt to be invoked to control the various services that may need to be involved in the response. ICS has varied levels of escalation, such as might be needed for multiple incidents in a given area (<!-- This bracket is unbalanced! Please correct.-->e.g., [[Attacks on the London Underground#2005 terrorist bomb attacks|the 2005 bombings in London]] or the [[2004 Madrid train bombings]], or all the way to a [[National Response Plan]] invocation if national-level resources are needed. National response, for example, might be needed for a nuclear, biological, radiological, or large chemical attack.\n\n=== Damage mitigation ===\n[[Fire department]]s, perhaps supplemented by public works agencies, utility providers (e.g., gas, water, electricity), and heavy construction contractors, are most apt to deal with the physical consequences of an attack.\n\n=== Local security ===\nAgain under an incident command model, local police can isolate the incident area, reducing confusion, and specialized police units can conduct tactical operations against terrorists, often using [[#Counter-terrorism tactical units|specialized counter-terrorist tactical units]].  Bringing in such units will normally involve civil or military authority beyond the local level.\n\n=== Medical services ===\n[[Emergency medical services]] will triage, treat, and transport the more seriously affected victims to hospitals, which will also need to have mass casualty and [[triage]] plans in place.\n\n[[Public health surveillance|Public health agencies]], from local to national level, may be designated to deal with identification, and sometimes mitigation, of possible biological attacks, and sometimes chemical or radiologic contamination.\n\n== Tactical units ==\n[[File:UTK PGK broke the door.JPG|thumb|[[Royal Malaysia Police]] ''Pasukan Gerakan Khas'' officers]]\n\nToday, many countries have [[List of special police units|special units]] designated to handle terrorist threats. Besides various [[security agency|security agencies]], there are [[Special Weapons And Tactics|elite tactical units]], also known as [[Special Mission Unit|special mission units]], whose role is to directly engage terrorists and prevent terrorist attacks.\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:NSG Air Assault Mumbai Attacks.jpg|left|thumb|224x224px|[[National Security Guard|NSG]] commandos launching their assault on terrorist occupied [[Nariman House]] during the [[2008 Mumbai Attacks]]]] -->\nSuch units perform both in preventive actions, [[hostage rescue]] and responding to on-going attacks. Countries of all sizes can have highly trained counter-terrorist teams. Tactics, techniques and procedures for [[Manhunt (military)|manhunting]] are under constant development.\n\nMost of these measures deal with terrorist attacks that affect an area, or threaten to do so. It is far harder to deal with assassination, or even reprisals on individuals, due to the short (if any) warning time and the quick exfiltration of the assassins.<ref>{{cite journal\n |author       = Stathis N.

In this environment, the development of a persistent Anti-terrorism protection system is a daunting task. Such a system should bring together diverse state-of-the-art technologies to enable persistent intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions, and enable potential actions. Designing such a system-of-systems comprises a major technological project.\n\nA particular design problem for this system is that it will face many [[Uncertainty|uncertainties]] in the future. The threat of terrorism may increase, decrease or remain the same, the type of terrorism and location are difficult to predict, and there are technological uncertainties. Yet we want to design a terrorism system conceived and designed today in order to prevent acts of terrorism for a decade or more. A potential solution is to incorporate [[Flexibility (engineering)|flexibility]] into system design for the reason that the flexibility embedded can be exercised in future as [[uncertainty]] unfolds and updated information arrives. And the design and valuation of a protection system should not be based on a single scenario, but an array of scenarios. Flexibility can be incorporated in the design of the terrorism system in the form of options that can be exercised in the future when new information is available. Using these '[[real options]]' will create a flexible Anti-terrorism system that is able to cope with new requirements that may arise.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1539-6924.2008.01160.x| title = Reducing Risk Through Real Options in Systems Design: The Case of Architecting a Maritime Domain Protection System| year = 2009| last1 = Buurman | first1 = J. | last2 = Zhang | first2 = S. | last3 = Babovic | first3 = V. | journal = Risk Analysis| volume = 29| issue = 3| pages = 366\u2013379 | pmid = 19076327}}</ref>\n\n=== Law enforcement/Police ===\nWhile some countries with longstanding terrorism problems, such as Israel, have law enforcement agencies primarily designed to prevent and respond to terror attacks,<ref>Juergensmeyer, Mark (2000).

The Policing of Terrorism: Organizational and Global Perspectives. New York: Routledge.</ref> Local agencies began to establish more patterned lines of communication with federal agencies.

Since terrorism is such a rare event phenomena,<ref>Kilburn Jr., John C. and Costanza, S.E.  2009  \"Immigration and Homeland Security\"  published in Battleground: Immigration (Ed: Judith Ann Warner); Greenwood Publishing, Ca.</ref> measuring arrests or clearance rates would be a non-generalizable and ineffective way to test enforcement policy effectiveness. Another methodological problem in assessing counter-terrorism efforts in law enforcement hinges on finding operational measures for key concepts in the study of homeland security.

Instead the counter-terrorism function is an element of the role, allowing flexibility in their employment, with operations being undertaken in the domestic or international context.\n\nIn some cases the legal framework within which they operate prohibits military units conducting operations in the domestic arena; [[United States Department of Defense]] policy, based on the [[Posse Comitatus Act]], forbids domestic counter-terrorism operations by the U.S. military. Units allocated some operational counter-terrorism task are frequently [[Special Forces]] or similar assets.\n\nIn cases where military organisations do operate in the domestic context some form of formal handover from the law enforcement community is regularly required, to ensure adherence to the legislative framework and limitations. such as the [[Iranian Embassy Siege]], the British police formally turned responsibility over to the [[Special Air Service]] when the situation went beyond police capabilities.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons}}\n{{Wikipedia books|Counterterrorism Handbook}}\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Civilian casualty ratio]]\n* [[Counterinsurgency]]\n* [[Counter-IED efforts]]\n* [[Counterjihad]]\n* [[Deradicalization]]\n* [[Explosive detection]]\n* [[Extrajudicial execution]]\n* [[Extraordinary rendition]]\n* [[Fatwa on Terrorism]]\n* [[Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism]]\n* [[Informant]]\n* [[International counter-terrorism operations of Russia]]\n* [[Irregular warfare]]\n* [[Manhunt (law enforcement)]]\n* [[Manhunt (military)]]\n* [[Preventive State]]\n* [[Security increase]]\n* [[Sociology of terrorism]]\n* [[Special Activities Division]], Central Intelligence Agency\n* [[Targeted killing]]\n* [[Terrorism Research Center]]\n* [[War amongst the people]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Ariel Merari, \"Terrorism as a Strategy in Insurgency,\" ''Terrorism and Political Violence'', Vol. 5, No. 4 (Winter 1993), pp.&nbsp;213\u2013251.\n* Edwin Bakker, Tinka Veldhuis, [http://www.icct.nl/news/a-fear-management-approach-to-counter-terrorism ''A Fear Management Approach to Counter-Terrorism'' (International Centre for Counter-Terrorism \u2013 The Hague, 2012)]\n* J.M.

Good intelligence is at the heart of such preparation, as well as political and social understanding of any grievances that might be solved.

The [[Prevention of Violence Act 1939]] was brought in response to an Irish Republican Army (IRA) campaign of violence under the [[S-Plan]]. This act had been allowed to expire in 1953 and was repealed in 1973 to be replaced by the [[Prevention of Terrorism Acts]] a response to [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland. From 1974 to 1989 the temporary provisions of the act were renewed annually.\n* In 2000 the Acts were replaced with the more permanent [[Terrorism Act 2000]], which contained many of their powers, and then the [[Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005]].\n* The [[Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001]] was formally introduced into the Parliament November 19, 2001 two months after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] in the United States. It received royal assent and went into force on December 13, 2001. On December 16, 2004 the Law Lords ruled that Part 4 was incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, but under the terms of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] it remained in force. The [[Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005]] was drafted to answer the Law Lords ruling and the [[Terrorism Act 2006]] creates new offences related to terrorism, and amends existing ones. The Act was drafted in the aftermath of the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]], and like its predecessors some of its terms have proven to be highly controversial.\n\nSince 1978 the UK's terrorism laws have been regularly reviewed by a security-cleared [[Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation]], whose often influential reports are submitted to Parliament and published in full.\n;{{US}}\n* U.S. legal issues surrounding this issue include rulings on the domestic employment of [[deadly force]] by law enforcement organizations.\n* Search and seizure is governed by the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].\n* The U.S. passed the [[USA PATRIOT Act]] after the September 11 attacks, as well as a range of other legislation and [[executive orders]] relating to national security.\n* The [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] was established to consolidate domestic security agencies to coordinate anti-terrorism, as well as national response to major natural disasters and accidents.\n* The [[Posse Comitatus Act]] limits domestic employment of the [[United States Army]] and the [[United States Air Force]], requiring Presidential approval prior to deploying the Army and/or the Air Force. [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] policy also applies this limitation to the [[United States Marine Corps]] and the [[United States Navy]], because the Posse Comitatus Act does not cover naval services, even though they are federal military forces. The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] can be employed domestically on Presidential order, as was done during the [[Los Angeles riots of 1992]], [[Hurricane Katrina]], and the [[Beltway Sniper]] incidents.\n* External or international use of lethal force would require a [[Presidential finding]].\n* In February 2017, sources claimed that the Trump administration intends to rename and revamp the U.S. government program [[Countering Violent Extremism Task Force|Countering Violent Extremism]] (CVE) to solely focus on Islamist extremism.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-extremists-program-exclusiv-idUSKBN15G5VO Exclusive: Trump to focus counter-extremism program solely on Islam - sources], Reuters 2017-02-02</ref>\n\n; {{AUS}}\n* Australia has passed several anti-terrorism acts. In 2004, a bill comprising three acts [[Australian anti-terrorism legislation, 2004|Anti-terrorism Act, 2004, (No 2) and (No 3)]] was passed. Then Attorney-General, [[Philip Ruddock]], introduced the ''Anti-terrorism bill, 2004'' on March 31. He described it as ''\"a bill to strengthen Australia's counter-terrorism laws in a number of respects&nbsp;\u2013 a task made more urgent following the recent tragic [[11 March 2004 Madrid attacks|terrorist bombings in Spain]].\"'' He said that Australia's counter-terrorism laws \"require review and, where necessary, updating if we are to have a legal framework capable of safeguarding all Australians from the scourge of terrorism.\" The [[Australian Anti-Terrorism Act 2005]] supplemented the powers of the earlier acts. The Australian legislation allows police to detain suspects for up to two weeks without charge and to electronically track suspects for up to a year. The [[Australian Anti-Terrorism Act 2005#The \"Shoot to Kill\" Clause|Australian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2005]] included a \"shoot-to-kill\" clause.

[[Amnesty International]] included a section on confronting terrorism in the recommendations in the Madrid Agenda arising from the Madrid Summit on Democracy and Terrorism (Madrid March 8\u201311, 2005):\n\n{{quote|Democratic principles and values are essential tools in the fight against terrorism. Any successful strategy for dealing with terrorism requires terrorists to be isolated. Consequently, the preference must be to treat terrorism as criminal acts to be handled through existing systems of law enforcement and with full respect for human rights and the rule of law. We recommend: (1) taking effective measures to make impunity impossible either for acts of terrorism or for the abuse of human rights in counter-terrorism measures. (2) the incorporation of human rights laws in all anti-terrorism programmes and policies of national governments as well as international bodies.\"<ref name=\"Amnesty International 2005\">Amnesty International (2005): \"Counter-terrorism and criminal law in the EU. [https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/ior61/013/2005/en/ online]</ref>}}\n\nWhile international efforts to combat terrorism have focused on the need to enhance cooperation between states, proponents of human rights (as well as [[human security]]) have suggested that more effort needs to be given to the effective inclusion of human rights protection as a crucial element in that cooperation. They argue that international human rights obligations do not stop at borders and a failure to respect human rights in one state may undermine its effectiveness in the international effort to cooperate to combat terrorism.<ref name=\"Human Rights News 2004\">Human Rights News (2004): \"Human Rights and Counter-Terrorism\", in the Briefing to the 60th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights. [http://hrw.org/english/docs/2004/01/29/global7127.htm online]</ref>\n\n=== Preemptive neutralization ===\nSome countries see preemptive attacks as a legitimate strategy. This includes capturing, killing, or disabling suspected terrorists before they can mount an attack. [[Israel]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], and [[Russia]] have taken this approach, while Western European states generally do not.\n\nAnother major method of preemptive neutralization is [[interrogation]] of known or suspected terrorists to obtain information about specific plots, targets, the identity of other terrorists, whether or not the interrogation subjects himself is guilty of terrorist involvement. Sometimes more extreme methods are used to increase [[suggestibility]], such as [[sleep deprivation]] or drugs. Such methods may lead captives to offer false information in an attempt to stop the treatment, or due to the confusion brought on by it. These methods are not tolerated by European powers. In 1978 the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled in the [[Ireland v. United Kingdom (1978)|Ireland v. United Kingdom]] case that [[five techniques|such methods]] amounted to a practice of inhuman and degrading treatment, and that such practices were in breach of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] Article 3 (art. 3).\n\n==== Non-military ====\nThe [[human security]] paradigm outlines a non-military approach which aims to address the enduring underlying inequalities which fuel terrorist activity. Causal factors need to be delineated and measures implemented which allow equal access to resources and [[sustainability]] for all people. Such activities empower citizens providing 'freedom from fear' and 'freedom from want'.\n\nThis can take many forms including the provision of clean drinking water, education, vaccination programs, provision of food and shelter and protection from violence, military or otherwise. Successful human security campaigns have been characterized by the participation of a diverse group of actors including governments, [[NGOs]], and citizens.\n\n[[Foreign internal defense]] programs provide outside expert assistance to a threatened government. FID can involve both non-military and military aspects of counter-terrorism.\n\nA 2017 study found that \"governance and civil society aid is effective in dampening domestic terrorism, but this effect is only present if the recipient country is not experiencing a civil conflict.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Foreign Aid as a Counterterrorism Tool - Burcu Savun, Daniel C.

That was the main stated justification for the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|U.S. invasion of Afghanistan]]. It was also a stated justification for the [[second Russian invasion of Chechnya]].\n\nMilitary intervention has not always been successful in stopping or preventing future terrorism, like during the [[Malayan Emergency]], the [[Mau Mau uprising]], and most of the campaigns against the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] during the [[Irish Civil War]], the [[S-Plan]], the [[Border Campaign (IRA)]] and [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland.

Local [[firefighter]]s and emergency medical personnel (often called \"first responders\") have plans for mitigating the effects of terrorist attacks, although police may deal with threats of such attacks.\n\n=== Target-hardening ===\n\nWhatever the target of terrorists, there are multiple ways of hardening the targets to prevent the terrorists from hitting their mark, or reducing the damage of attacks. One method is to place [[Hostile vehicle mitigation]] to enforce protective standoff distance outside tall or politically sensitive buildings to prevent car and [[truck bomb]]ing. Another way to reduce the impact of attacks is to design buildings for rapid evacuation.<ref>{{cite journal\n | author = Ronchi, E.\n | title = Disaster management: Design buildings for rapid evacuation\n | year = 2015\n | journal = Nature\n | volume = 528\n | issue = 7582\n | pages = 333\n | doi=10.1038/528333b\n | pmid=26672544\n| bibcode = 2015Natur.528..333R\n }}</ref>\n\nAircraft cockpits are kept locked during flights, and have reinforced doors, which only the pilots in the cabin are capable of opening.

The [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]] purchased bomb-resistant barriers after the [[September 11 terrorist attacks]].\n\n[[File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - Iron Dome Intercepts Rockets from the Gaza Strip.jpg|thumb|[[Iron Dome]] air defense system. It intercepts artillery rockets fired by terrorist onto Israeli cities and towns.]]\nAs [[Israel]] is suffering from constant shelling of its cities, towns and settlements by [[artillery rocket]]s from the [[Gaza Strip]] (mainly by [[Hamas]], but also by other Palestinian factions) and [[Lebanon]] (mainly by [[Hezbollah]]), Israel developed several defensive measures against artillery, rockets and missiles. These include building a [[bomb shelter]] in every building and [[school]], but also deploying active protection systems like the [[Arrow (Israeli missile)|Arrow ABM]], [[Iron Dome]] and [[David's Sling]] batteries which intercept the incoming threat in the air. [[Iron Dome]] has successfully intercepted hundreds of [[Qassam rocket]]s and [[Grad rocket]]s fired by Palestinians from the Gaza Strip.\n\nA more sophisticated target-hardening approach must consider industrial and other critical industrial infrastructure that could be attacked. Terrorists need not import chemical weapons if they can cause a major industrial accident such as the [[Bhopal disaster]] or the [[Halifax Explosion]]. Industrial chemicals in manufacturing, shipping, and storage need greater protection, and some efforts are in progress.<ref>{{cite journal\n | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A64224-2005Jan10.html\n | title = D.C.

Industrial shipments of chlorine, widely used in water purification and the chemical industry, travel in 90 or 55 ton tank cars.\n\nTo give one more example, the North American electrical grid has already demonstrated, in the [[Northeast Blackout of 2003]], its vulnerability to natural disasters coupled with inadequate, possibly insecure, [[SCADA]] (supervisory control and data acquisition) networks. Part of the vulnerability is due to deregulation leading to much more interconnection in a grid designed for only occasional power-selling between utilities. A small number of terrorists, attacking key power facilities when one or more engineers have infiltrated the power control centers, could wreak havoc.\n\nEquipping likely targets with containers (i.e., bags) of pig lard has been utilized to discourage attacks by suicide bombers. The technique was apparently used on a limited scale by British authorities in the 1940s.<ref>{{cite journal\n | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3484277.stm\n | title = Suicide bombing 'pig fat threat\n | date = February 13, 2004\n | accessdate=January 2, 2010\n | journal=BBC News}}</ref> The approach stems from the idea that Muslims perpetrating the attack would not want to be \"soiled\" by the lard in the moment prior to dying.

ICS has varied levels of escalation, such as might be needed for multiple incidents in a given area (<!-- This bracket is unbalanced! Please correct.-->e.g., [[Attacks on the London Underground#2005 terrorist bomb attacks|the 2005 bombings in London]] or the [[2004 Madrid train bombings]], or all the way to a [[National Response Plan]] invocation if national-level resources are needed. National response, for example, might be needed for a nuclear, biological, radiological, or large chemical attack.\n\n=== Damage mitigation ===\n[[Fire department]]s, perhaps supplemented by public works agencies, utility providers (e.g., gas, water, electricity), and heavy construction contractors, are most apt to deal with the physical consequences of an attack.\n\n=== Local security ===\nAgain under an incident command model, local police can isolate the incident area, reducing confusion, and specialized police units can conduct tactical operations against terrorists, often using [[#Counter-terrorism tactical units|specialized counter-terrorist tactical units]].  Bringing in such units will normally involve civil or military authority beyond the local level.\n\n=== Medical services ===\n[[Emergency medical services]] will triage, treat, and transport the more seriously affected victims to hospitals, which will also need to have mass casualty and [[triage]] plans in place.\n\n[[Public health surveillance|Public health agencies]], from local to national level, may be designated to deal with identification, and sometimes mitigation, of possible biological attacks, and sometimes chemical or radiologic contamination.\n\n== Tactical units ==\n[[File:UTK PGK broke the door.JPG|thumb|[[Royal Malaysia Police]] ''Pasukan Gerakan Khas'' officers]]\n\nToday, many countries have [[List of special police units|special units]] designated to handle terrorist threats.

Countries of all sizes can have highly trained counter-terrorist teams. Tactics, techniques and procedures for [[Manhunt (military)|manhunting]] are under constant development.\n\nMost of these measures deal with terrorist attacks that affect an area, or threaten to do so. It is far harder to deal with assassination, or even reprisals on individuals, due to the short (if any) warning time and the quick exfiltration of the assassins.<ref>{{cite journal\n |author       = Stathis N.

In this environment, the development of a persistent Anti-terrorism protection system is a daunting task. Such a system should bring together diverse state-of-the-art technologies to enable persistent intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions, and enable potential actions. Designing such a system-of-systems comprises a major technological project.\n\nA particular design problem for this system is that it will face many [[Uncertainty|uncertainties]] in the future. The threat of terrorism may increase, decrease or remain the same, the type of terrorism and location are difficult to predict, and there are technological uncertainties. Yet we want to design a terrorism system conceived and designed today in order to prevent acts of terrorism for a decade or more. A potential solution is to incorporate [[Flexibility (engineering)|flexibility]] into system design for the reason that the flexibility embedded can be exercised in future as [[uncertainty]] unfolds and updated information arrives. And the design and valuation of a protection system should not be based on a single scenario, but an array of scenarios. Flexibility can be incorporated in the design of the terrorism system in the form of options that can be exercised in the future when new information is available. Using these '[[real options]]' will create a flexible Anti-terrorism system that is able to cope with new requirements that may arise.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1539-6924.2008.01160.x| title = Reducing Risk Through Real Options in Systems Design: The Case of Architecting a Maritime Domain Protection System| year = 2009| last1 = Buurman | first1 = J. | last2 = Zhang | first2 = S. | last3 = Babovic | first3 = V. | journal = Risk Analysis| volume = 29| issue = 3| pages = 366\u2013379 | pmid = 19076327}}</ref>\n\n=== Law enforcement/Police ===\nWhile some countries with longstanding terrorism problems, such as Israel, have law enforcement agencies primarily designed to prevent and respond to terror attacks,<ref>Juergensmeyer, Mark (2000).

The Policing of Terrorism: Organizational and Global Perspectives. New York: Routledge.</ref> Local agencies began to establish more patterned lines of communication with federal agencies.

Since terrorism is such a rare event phenomena,<ref>Kilburn Jr., John C. and Costanza, S.E.  2009  \"Immigration and Homeland Security\"  published in Battleground: Immigration (Ed: Judith Ann Warner); Greenwood Publishing, Ca.</ref> measuring arrests or clearance rates would be a non-generalizable and ineffective way to test enforcement policy effectiveness. Another methodological problem in assessing counter-terrorism efforts in law enforcement hinges on finding operational measures for key concepts in the study of homeland security.

Instead the counter-terrorism function is an element of the role, allowing flexibility in their employment, with operations being undertaken in the domestic or international context.\n\nIn some cases the legal framework within which they operate prohibits military units conducting operations in the domestic arena; [[United States Department of Defense]] policy, based on the [[Posse Comitatus Act]], forbids domestic counter-terrorism operations by the U.S. military. Units allocated some operational counter-terrorism task are frequently [[Special Forces]] or similar assets.\n\nIn cases where military organisations do operate in the domestic context some form of formal handover from the law enforcement community is regularly required, to ensure adherence to the legislative framework and limitations. such as the [[Iranian Embassy Siege]], the British police formally turned responsibility over to the [[Special Air Service]] when the situation went beyond police capabilities.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons}}\n{{Wikipedia books|Counterterrorism Handbook}}\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Civilian casualty ratio]]\n* [[Counterinsurgency]]\n* [[Counter-IED efforts]]\n* [[Counterjihad]]\n* [[Deradicalization]]\n* [[Explosive detection]]\n* [[Extrajudicial execution]]\n* [[Extraordinary rendition]]\n* [[Fatwa on Terrorism]]\n* [[Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism]]\n* [[Informant]]\n* [[International counter-terrorism operations of Russia]]\n* [[Irregular warfare]]\n* [[Manhunt (law enforcement)]]\n* [[Manhunt (military)]]\n* [[Preventive State]]\n* [[Security increase]]\n* [[Sociology of terrorism]]\n* [[Special Activities Division]], Central Intelligence Agency\n* [[Targeted killing]]\n* [[Terrorism Research Center]]\n* [[War amongst the people]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Ariel Merari, \"Terrorism as a Strategy in Insurgency,\" ''Terrorism and Political Violence'', Vol. 5, No. 4 (Winter 1993), pp.&nbsp;213\u2013251.\n* Edwin Bakker, Tinka Veldhuis, [http://www.icct.nl/news/a-fear-management-approach-to-counter-terrorism ''A Fear Management Approach to Counter-Terrorism'' (International Centre for Counter-Terrorism \u2013 The Hague, 2012)]\n* J.M.

Reaching a peak in popularity in the early 80s, the band has continued a long-running successful career.\n\nRiot has toured with [[AC/DC]], [[Molly Hatchet]], [[Sammy Hagar]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Vandenberg (band)|Vandenberg]], [[Black Sabbath]] and [[Rush (band)|Rush]] among others.\n\nRiot's sound initially started out as straightforward heavy metal, but since their 1988 release ''[[Thundersteel]]'' their musical direction has been more along the lines of power metal.\n\nIn 2013, Riot V, a new iteration of the band was launched by the surviving members, after the death of founding member and band leader [[Mark Reale]].\n\nThe group usually uses a baby seal face as a logo on its album covers.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early years (1975\u20131983)===\nRiot was formed in 1975 in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]] when [[Kon-Tiki]] guitarist [[Mark Reale]] and drummer Peter Bitelli recruited bassist Phil Feit and vocalist [[Guy Speranza]].<ref name=\"LarkinHM\">{{cite book|title=The Guinness Who's Who of Heavy Metal|title-link=Encyclopedia of Popular Music|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1995|edition=Second|isbn=0-85112-656-1|pages=298/9}}</ref> The line up recorded a four-track demo, which they hoped would be included in a proposed compilation of new rock bands. While waiting for the project to get off the ground, they added Steve Costello on keyboards.\n\nReale took the various demos to New York-based producers Billy Arnell and Steve Loeb, who also owned [[Greene St. Recording|Greene Street Recording Studio]] and the independent label Fire-Sign Records. Arnell and Loeb turned down the compilation proposal but signed Riot. The band added second guitarist Louie Kouvaris and replaced Feit with Jimmy Iommi, though both bass players participated in the recording of its debut album, ''[[Rock City (Riot album)|Rock City]]''<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/>; the record was recorded and produced by Arnell and Loeb and released on their Fire Sign Records.  After a promising start and support slots with [[AC/DC]] and [[Molly Hatchet]], the band were unable to maintain momentum and were on the verge of breaking up by 1979.\n\nIn that year, however, the [[new wave of British heavy metal]] broke mainstream, and the band came to the attention of influential DJ [[Neal Kay]] who spread the word about them in Britain where fans bought imported copies of ''Rock City''. Encouraged, Arnell and Loeb, now Riot's managers, recorded the band's new album ''[[Narita (album)|Narita]]''. In the course of recording, Kouvaris was replaced by roadie Rick Ventura .<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/>\n\nSubsequent to a successful support of [[Sammy Hagar]] on his US Texas tour, [[Capitol Records]] offered Riot a worldwide deal for ''Narita,'' mostly to support Hagar. Capitol and Hagar needed a harder, younger edge to associate with him, so Riot was chosen if they agreed to support Hagar on his UK tour. Hagar and Riot had a successful tour, but Riot was dropped by Capitol as soon as they were finished promoting Hagar.\n\nArnell and Loeb spent the remaining Capitol Records advance while retaining important indie FM radio promotions to promote the last Riot album. Arnell and Loeb put the album on as many radio stations around the country as possible, thus raising the radio profile enough to where Capitol picked up their option for another record, which led to Riot's biggest selling album, ''[[Fire Down Under]]''.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/>\n\nWhen the record was completed some months later, Capitol turned the record down calling it \"commercially unacceptable\",{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} which put the band in contractual limbo. Capitol refused to release the band from the contract. A campaign was organized and financed by producers Arnell and Loeb, and engaging fans around the world. Fans picketed the offices of EMI Records, especially in the UK.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> Finally, [[Elektra Records]] reached an agreement with Capitol Vice President [[Rupert Perry]] and immediately released ''Fire Down Under'', which then soared into the [[Billboard 200]] chart.\n\n===Breakup, the \"Reunion\" and Reale's death (1983\u20132012)===\nSinger [[Guy Speranza]] (March 12, 1956 \u2013 November 8, 2003) had difficulty melding his religious convictions with his role in the band and was replaced by [[Rhett Forrester]] (September 22, 1956 \u2013  January 22, 1994) for the next album, ''[[Restless Breed]]'' (1982).<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> Though a striking frontman, any hope of a major breakthrough was sunk by a combination of Forrester's erratic behaviour on the road, a changing of the guard at Elektra, and the 1983 success of [[Quiet Riot]]'s cover of \"[[Cum on Feel the Noize]]\".  The next album, ''[[Born in America]]'', (1983) was self-financed by Steve Loeb and was released on [[Quality Records]], an independent Canadian label.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/>  A note on the reverse of the album tried to explain away would-be fans' confusion between Riot and the now No.&nbsp;1-selling Quiet Riot, but support melted away, leading to the band's disintegration.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/>\n\nReale relocated to San Antonio, Texas, where he recruited former [[S.A.Slayer]] members Steve Cooper, Don Van Stavern, and Dave McClain (now with [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]]) for a short-lived new band called Narita.  By 1986, Reale and Van Stavern had made their way out to Los Angeles in an attempt to resurrect Riot along with former members Sandy Slavin and Rhett Forrester.  Harry 'The Tyrant' Conklin ([[Jag Panzer]]) handled vocals for a short time but was dismissed after losing his voice on the second night of back-to-back gigs due to excessive drinking.  Eventually, Reale reunited with producer Steve Loeb and moved back to New York.  Drummer Mark Edwards ([[Steeler (American band)|Steeler]], Third Stage Alert) was recruited to complete the new rhythm section with bassist Don Van Stavern, while Greene Street Studio manager Dave Harrington brought in [[Tony Moore (singer)|Tony Moore]] (real name: Tony Morabito) on vocals.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> Loeb cut a four-track demo at his Greene Street Studio in Soho, New York and along with real estate maven turned rock manager Vince Perazzo, brought the band to [[CBS]] Associated, who offered the band a worldwide deal. Edwards elected to leave the band as his own Los Angeles-based group [[Lion (band)|Lion]] was getting signed to Scotti Brothers. He was  superseded by San Antonio, Texas native [[Bobby Jarzombek]], formerly with [[Juggernaut (band)|Juggernaut]], who cut the rest of the drum tracks for what became the ''[[Thundersteel]]'' album, released in 1988.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> It was followed by the more experimental ''[[The Privilege of Power]]'' (1990),<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> which saw the band augment their state-of-the-art heavy metal sound with horns, courtesy of the [[Brecker Brothers]] and [[Tower of Power]].  The album also featured a guest vocal appearance by [[Joe Lynn Turner]] of [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]] fame.  Second guitarist Mike Flyntz joined the ranks for the band's 1989 ''[[Thundersteel]]'' tour of Japan where Riot maintained their strongest subsequent following. Along with hiring tour manager Joey Batts who toured with them through the U.S and Japan.  Bassist Don Van Stavern quit the band after the US leg of the ''Privilege of Power'' tour and was replaced by fellow Texan Pete Perez (ex-Karion).\n\nIn 1992, vocalist Tony Moore left the group over disagreements with manager/producer Steve Loeb. Reale recruited newcomer [[Mike DiMeo]], who had played with [[Howard Stern]] sidekick [[Stuttering John]] Melendez in a local band named Josie Sang, with a view toward making a more hard rock-oriented solo album. Eventually, those plans were dropped and the proposed solo effort turned into another Riot album, 1993's ''[[Nightbreaker]]'',<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> which featured a remake of the ''[[Fire Down Under]]'' track \"Outlaw\", as well as covers of [[Deep Purple]]'s \"[[Burn (Deep Purple song)|Burn]]\" and \"[[A Whiter Shade of Pale]]\" by [[Procol Harum]]. The following LP, the Native American-themed ''[[Brethren of the Long House]]'' (1996), which saw [[John Macaluso]] ([[TNT (Norwegian band)|TNT]], [[Powermad]]) briefly take over for Bobby Jarzombek on drums, marked the final collaboration with long-time associate Steve Loeb who stepped down from the production chair in 1995. All told, Loeb produced or co-produced 13 Riot albums in his 19-year association with Reale and the different configurations of Riot. For the rest of the decade Riot maintained a stable line-up for the first time in its history, resulting in a steady output of high-quality albums, i.e. ''[[Inishmore (album)|Inishmore]]'' (1998), ''[[Shine On (Riot album)|Shine On]]'' live (1998), and ''[[Sons of Society]]'' (1999).  Jarzombek left again in late 1999, this time to join former [[Judas Priest]] vocalist [[Rob Halford]] in his new venture [[Halford (band)|Halford]].  Pat Magrath (Prototype, Killing Culture) filled in for Jarzombek on the following European tour before being replaced by veteran skinsman [[Bobby Rondinelli]] (Rainbow, [[Black Sabbath]], [[Blue \u00d6yster Cult]]) with whom the band recorded ''[[Through the Storm (Riot album)|Through the Storm]]'' (2002).\n\nIn 2006, Riot returned with yet another album, ''[[Army of One (album)|Army of One]]'', featuring new addition Frank Gilchriest ([[Virgin Steele]], Gothic Knights) on drums. It marked the final album with vocalist [[Mike DiMeo]] who had earlier announced his departure in order to concentrate on his work with retro rockers The Lizards after a 12-year run with Riot.  DiMeo was succeeded by the New York area singer Mike Tirelli, whose Riot live debut came in early 2005 at the band's Atarfe Vega Rock Festival appearance in [[Granada]], Spain.\n\nRiot with Tirelli toured the United States for most of 2005, and made an appearance in Japan in both 2006 and 2007, and undertook an extensive tour of Spain in 2007.\n\nIn 2008, it was announced that the classic ''[[Thundersteel]]''-era line-up would reunite for a tour,<ref>{{cite web|title=Riot's 'Thundersteel' lineup to tour Europe in June|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=111557|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715191631/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=111557|archivedate=July 15, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> starting in June 2009 with high-profile shows at the [[Sweden Rock]] and Metalway festivals, followed by a tour of Japan in the fall.

Immediately following his passing, the band, featuring the \"Thundersteel\" lineup, performed several previously-booked east coast shows and the \"70,000 Tons of Metal\" cruise ship gig without him. A new Riot compilation was released following the shows, and at the request of Mark's father, the name \"Riot\" was put to rest. However, some former members of the \"Thundersteel\"-era lineup began work putting together a new band performing music in the same vein as Riot.\n\n=== Second reunion as Riot V (2013\u2013present) ===\nThe band was officially re-launched as \"Riot V\", the name alluding to the addition of [[Todd Michael Hall]] as the fifth official singer, replacing Moore. Van Stavern revealed that Moore had chosen not to continue with the band to spend more time with his family.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metalsquadron.com/2014/10/21/the-fifth-chapter/|title=RIOT V: The fifth chapter|website=Metalsquadron.com|date=October 21, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Nick Lee, a former student at the guitar classes run by Flyntz, joined as the new co-lead guitarist for the band, replacing deceased Reale, and Frank Gilchriest rejoined the band in place of Jarzombek, who had quit the band to focus on his activities with [[Fates Warning]]. Their new album ''Unleash The Fire'' was released in Japan, under the name Riot, in August 2014. This is the band's first release since the death of Reale.\n\n[[Todd Michael Hall]] said about the \"V\" letter: \"The official name for the band is Riot V, but we do have this confusion with the Japanese release versus the European release.

Reaching a peak in popularity in the early 80s, the band has continued a long-running successful career.\n\nRiot has toured with [[AC/DC]], [[Molly Hatchet]], [[Sammy Hagar]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Vandenberg (band)|Vandenberg]], [[Black Sabbath]] and [[Rush (band)|Rush]] among others.\n\nRiot's sound initially started out as straightforward heavy metal, but since their 1988 release ''[[Thundersteel]]'' their musical direction has been more along the lines of power metal.\n\nIn 2013, Riot V, a new iteration of the band was launched by the surviving members, after the death of founding member and band leader [[Mark Reale]].\n\nThe group usually uses a baby seal face as a logo on its album covers.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early years (1975\u20131983)===\nRiot was formed in 1975 in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]] when [[Kon-Tiki]] guitarist [[Mark Reale]] and drummer Peter Bitelli recruited bassist Phil Feit and vocalist [[Guy Speranza]].<ref name=\"LarkinHM\">{{cite book|title=The Guinness Who's Who of Heavy Metal|title-link=Encyclopedia of Popular Music|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1995|edition=Second|isbn=0-85112-656-1|pages=298/9}}</ref> The line up recorded a four-track demo, which they hoped would be included in a proposed compilation of new rock bands. While waiting for the project to get off the ground, they added Steve Costello on keyboards.\n\nReale took the various demos to New York-based producers Billy Arnell and Steve Loeb, who also owned [[Greene St. Recording|Greene Street Recording Studio]] and the independent label Fire-Sign Records. Arnell and Loeb turned down the compilation proposal but signed Riot. The band added second guitarist Louie Kouvaris and replaced Feit with Jimmy Iommi, though both bass players participated in the recording of its debut album, ''[[Rock City (Riot album)|Rock City]]''<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/>; the record was recorded and produced by Arnell and Loeb and released on their Fire Sign Records.  After a promising start and support slots with [[AC/DC]] and [[Molly Hatchet]], the band were unable to maintain momentum and were on the verge of breaking up by 1979.\n\nIn that year, however, the [[new wave of British heavy metal]] broke mainstream, and the band came to the attention of influential DJ [[Neal Kay]] who spread the word about them in Britain where fans bought imported copies of ''Rock City''. Encouraged, Arnell and Loeb, now Riot's managers, recorded the band's new album ''[[Narita (album)|Narita]]''. In the course of recording, Kouvaris was replaced by roadie Rick Ventura .<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/>\n\nSubsequent to a successful support of [[Sammy Hagar]] on his US Texas tour, [[Capitol Records]] offered Riot a worldwide deal for ''Narita,'' mostly to support Hagar. Capitol and Hagar needed a harder, younger edge to associate with him, so Riot was chosen if they agreed to support Hagar on his UK tour. Hagar and Riot had a successful tour, but Riot was dropped by Capitol as soon as they were finished promoting Hagar.\n\nArnell and Loeb spent the remaining Capitol Records advance while retaining important indie FM radio promotions to promote the last Riot album. Arnell and Loeb put the album on as many radio stations around the country as possible, thus raising the radio profile enough to where Capitol picked up their option for another record, which led to Riot's biggest selling album, ''[[Fire Down Under]]''.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/>\n\nWhen the record was completed some months later, Capitol turned the record down calling it \"commercially unacceptable\",{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} which put the band in contractual limbo. Capitol refused to release the band from the contract. A campaign was organized and financed by producers Arnell and Loeb, and engaging fans around the world. Fans picketed the offices of EMI Records, especially in the UK.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> Finally, [[Elektra Records]] reached an agreement with Capitol Vice President [[Rupert Perry]] and immediately released ''Fire Down Under'', which then soared into the [[Billboard 200]] chart.\n\n===Breakup, the \"Reunion\" and Reale's death (1983\u20132012)===\nSinger [[Guy Speranza]] (March 12, 1956 \u2013 November 8, 2003) had difficulty melding his religious convictions with his role in the band and was replaced by [[Rhett Forrester]] (September 22, 1956 \u2013  January 22, 1994) for the next album, ''[[Restless Breed]]'' (1982).<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> Though a striking frontman, any hope of a major breakthrough was sunk by a combination of Forrester's erratic behaviour on the road, a changing of the guard at Elektra, and the 1983 success of [[Quiet Riot]]'s cover of \"[[Cum on Feel the Noize]]\".  The next album, ''[[Born in America]]'', (1983) was self-financed by Steve Loeb and was released on [[Quality Records]], an independent Canadian label.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/>  A note on the reverse of the album tried to explain away would-be fans' confusion between Riot and the now No.&nbsp;1-selling Quiet Riot, but support melted away, leading to the band's disintegration.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/>\n\nReale relocated to San Antonio, Texas, where he recruited former [[S.A.Slayer]] members Steve Cooper, Don Van Stavern, and Dave McClain (now with [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]]) for a short-lived new band called Narita.  By 1986, Reale and Van Stavern had made their way out to Los Angeles in an attempt to resurrect Riot along with former members Sandy Slavin and Rhett Forrester.  Harry 'The Tyrant' Conklin ([[Jag Panzer]]) handled vocals for a short time but was dismissed after losing his voice on the second night of back-to-back gigs due to excessive drinking.  Eventually, Reale reunited with producer Steve Loeb and moved back to New York.  Drummer Mark Edwards ([[Steeler (American band)|Steeler]], Third Stage Alert) was recruited to complete the new rhythm section with bassist Don Van Stavern, while Greene Street Studio manager Dave Harrington brought in [[Tony Moore (singer)|Tony Moore]] (real name: Tony Morabito) on vocals.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> Loeb cut a four-track demo at his Greene Street Studio in Soho, New York and along with real estate maven turned rock manager Vince Perazzo, brought the band to [[CBS]] Associated, who offered the band a worldwide deal. Edwards elected to leave the band as his own Los Angeles-based group [[Lion (band)|Lion]] was getting signed to Scotti Brothers. He was  superseded by San Antonio, Texas native [[Bobby Jarzombek]], formerly with [[Juggernaut (band)|Juggernaut]], who cut the rest of the drum tracks for what became the ''[[Thundersteel]]'' album, released in 1988.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> It was followed by the more experimental ''[[The Privilege of Power]]'' (1990),<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> which saw the band augment their state-of-the-art heavy metal sound with horns, courtesy of the [[Brecker Brothers]] and [[Tower of Power]].  The album also featured a guest vocal appearance by [[Joe Lynn Turner]] of [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]] fame.  Second guitarist Mike Flyntz joined the ranks for the band's 1989 ''[[Thundersteel]]'' tour of Japan where Riot maintained their strongest subsequent following. Along with hiring tour manager Joey Batts who toured with them through the U.S and Japan.  Bassist Don Van Stavern quit the band after the US leg of the ''Privilege of Power'' tour and was replaced by fellow Texan Pete Perez (ex-Karion).\n\nIn 1992, vocalist Tony Moore left the group over disagreements with manager/producer Steve Loeb. Reale recruited newcomer [[Mike DiMeo]], who had played with [[Howard Stern]] sidekick [[Stuttering John]] Melendez in a local band named Josie Sang, with a view toward making a more hard rock-oriented solo album. Eventually, those plans were dropped and the proposed solo effort turned into another Riot album, 1993's ''[[Nightbreaker]]'',<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> which featured a remake of the ''[[Fire Down Under]]'' track \"Outlaw\", as well as covers of [[Deep Purple]]'s \"[[Burn (Deep Purple song)|Burn]]\" and \"[[A Whiter Shade of Pale]]\" by [[Procol Harum]]. The following LP, the Native American-themed ''[[Brethren of the Long House]]'' (1996), which saw [[John Macaluso]] ([[TNT (Norwegian band)|TNT]], [[Powermad]]) briefly take over for Bobby Jarzombek on drums, marked the final collaboration with long-time associate Steve Loeb who stepped down from the production chair in 1995. All told, Loeb produced or co-produced 13 Riot albums in his 19-year association with Reale and the different configurations of Riot. For the rest of the decade Riot maintained a stable line-up for the first time in its history, resulting in a steady output of high-quality albums, i.e. ''[[Inishmore (album)|Inishmore]]'' (1998), ''[[Shine On (Riot album)|Shine On]]'' live (1998), and ''[[Sons of Society]]'' (1999).  Jarzombek left again in late 1999, this time to join former [[Judas Priest]] vocalist [[Rob Halford]] in his new venture [[Halford (band)|Halford]].  Pat Magrath (Prototype, Killing Culture) filled in for Jarzombek on the following European tour before being replaced by veteran skinsman [[Bobby Rondinelli]] (Rainbow, [[Black Sabbath]], [[Blue \u00d6yster Cult]]) with whom the band recorded ''[[Through the Storm (Riot album)|Through the Storm]]'' (2002).\n\nIn 2006, Riot returned with yet another album, ''[[Army of One (album)|Army of One]]'', featuring new addition Frank Gilchriest ([[Virgin Steele]], Gothic Knights) on drums. It marked the final album with vocalist [[Mike DiMeo]] who had earlier announced his departure in order to concentrate on his work with retro rockers The Lizards after a 12-year run with Riot.  DiMeo was succeeded by the New York area singer Mike Tirelli, whose Riot live debut came in early 2005 at the band's Atarfe Vega Rock Festival appearance in [[Granada]], Spain.\n\nRiot with Tirelli toured the United States for most of 2005, and made an appearance in Japan in both 2006 and 2007, and undertook an extensive tour of Spain in 2007.\n\nIn 2008, it was announced that the classic ''[[Thundersteel]]''-era line-up would reunite for a tour,<ref>{{cite web|title=Riot's 'Thundersteel' lineup to tour Europe in June|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=111557|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715191631/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=111557|archivedate=July 15, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> starting in June 2009 with high-profile shows at the [[Sweden Rock]] and Metalway festivals, followed by a tour of Japan in the fall.

Immediately following his passing, the band, featuring the \"Thundersteel\" lineup, performed several previously-booked east coast shows and the \"70,000 Tons of Metal\" cruise ship gig without him. A new Riot compilation was released following the shows, and at the request of Mark's father, the name \"Riot\" was put to rest. However, some former members of the \"Thundersteel\"-era lineup began work putting together a new band performing music in the same vein as Riot.\n\n=== Second reunion as Riot V (2013\u2013present) ===\nThe band was officially re-launched as \"Riot V\", the name alluding to the addition of [[Todd Michael Hall]] as the fifth official singer, replacing Moore. Van Stavern revealed that Moore had chosen not to continue with the band to spend more time with his family.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metalsquadron.com/2014/10/21/the-fifth-chapter/|title=RIOT V: The fifth chapter|website=Metalsquadron.com|date=October 21, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Nick Lee, a former student at the guitar classes run by Flyntz, joined as the new co-lead guitarist for the band, replacing deceased Reale, and Frank Gilchriest rejoined the band in place of Jarzombek, who had quit the band to focus on his activities with [[Fates Warning]]. Their new album ''Unleash The Fire'' was released in Japan, under the name Riot, in August 2014. This is the band's first release since the death of Reale.\n\n[[Todd Michael Hall]] said about the \"V\" letter: \"The official name for the band is Riot V, but we do have this confusion with the Japanese release versus the European release.
