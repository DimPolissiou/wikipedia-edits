{"title_page": "Jainism and Hinduism", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2016}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=January 2016}}\n{{refimprove|date=June 2015}}\n{{Jainism}}\n'''Jainism''' and '''Christ ''' companions and share their foot fetish cream\n There are some similarities and differences between the two religions.{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=135-136}} Temples, gods, 123 give me some vbucks\n, fasts and other religious components of Jainism are different from those of Hinduism.{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=138}}\n\n\"Jain\" is derived from the word ''Jina'', referring to a human being who has conquered all inner passions (like anger, attachment, greed and pride) and possesses [[Kevala Jnana]] (pure infinite knowledge). Followers of the path shown by the Jinas are called Jains.{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=15}}{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=164}} Followers of Hinduism are called Hindus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Hinduism|title=Hinduism|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref>\n\n== Philosophical similarities and differences ==\nJainism and Hinduism have many similar characteristic features, including the concepts of ''[[samsara]]'', ''[[karma]]'' and ''[[moksha]]''. However, they differ over the precise nature and meaning of these concepts. The doctrine of Jainism has minor similarities with the Nyaya-Vaisheshika and samkhya school. The Jain doctrine teaches atomism which is also found in the Vaisheshika system and atheism which is found in Samkhya.{{sfn|Glasenapp|1999|p=496}} Within the doctrine of Jainism, there exist many metaphysical concepts which are not known in Hinduism, some of which are ''dharma'' and Adharma tattva (which are seen as substances within the Jain metaphysical system), [[Gunasthana]]s and [[Lesya]]s.{{sfn|Glasenapp|1999|p=496}} The epistemological concepts of [[Anekantavada]] and Syadvada are not found in the Hindu system. There were, in the past, attempts made to merge the concepts of Hindu gods and the Tirthankara of Jainism. The cosmography of Hindus resembles that of the Jains and there are similar names of heavenly gods within these systems.{{sfn|Glasenapp|1999|p=497}}\n\nIn the [[Upanishads]], there also occur the first statements of the view, dominant in Jainist teachings and elsewhere, that rebirth is undesirable and that it is possible by controlling or stopping one's actions to put an end to it and attain a state of deliverance (moksha) which lies beyond action.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=15}}\n\n===Moksha (liberation) ===\nIn Hinduism, [[moksha]] means merging of soul with universal soul or eternal being and escaping the cycle of births and deaths; in Jainism, it is action-less and peaceful existence. In Vedic philosophy or Sanatana Dharma, salvation is giving up the sense of being a doer and realizing Self to be the same as Universe and God.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-yaOxgEACAAJ&dq=moksha&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiy7OTeuYfnAhXwUN8KHbDaDL0Q6AEwCXoECAcQAQ|title=Moksha: Self-Liberation Through Self-Knowledge|last=Kajaria|first=Vish|date=2019-02-13|publisher=Independently Published|isbn=978-1-09-791542-2|language=en}}</ref> In Jainism, salvation can be achieved only through self-effort and is considered to be the right of human beings.{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=137}}\n\nIn Jainism, one definite path to attain liberation ([[Moksha (Jainism)|moksha]]) is prescribed. The prescribed threefold path consists of the [[Ratnatraya|three jewels of Jainism]] (Right belief, Right knowledge, Right conduct). In Hinduism, no one definite path to salvation is prescribed.{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p = 137}}\n\n=== Universe ===\n{{Further information|Jainism and non-creationism}}\nAccording to [[Jain cosmology]], the universe is eternal, it is neither created nor it can be destroyed. In Hinduism, it is believed to by a creator, and destroyed by God, to be created again. {{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=137}}\n\n=== Karma ===\n{{further information|Karma in Jainism|Karma in Hinduism}}\nKarma is an invisible force in Hinduism, whereas in Jainism it is a form of matter which can stick to the soul.{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=137}}\n\n=== Worship ===\nIn Hinduism, Gods are worshiped in several ways and for several reasons such as knowledge, peace, wisdom, health, and it also believed to be one's duty to pray god as God is considered as our maker (as we originated from them and we are staying in them and at last will merge with them), for moksham (by attaining moksham we can join him and escape this Maya or dualistic nature which makes us think that we are different from the universal soul) and are also offered food as a respect, etc.{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=137}}{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p=181}} In Jainism, the siddhas represent the true goal of all human beings,{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p=182}} their qualities are worshiped by the Jains.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n=== Self-defence and soldiering ===\nJains agree with Hindus that violence in self-defence can be justified,<ref>''Nisithabhasya'' (in ''Nisithasutra'') 289; Jinadatta Suri: ''Upadesharasayana'' 26; Dundas pp. 162\u2013163; T\u00e4htinen p. 31.</ref> and they agree that a soldier who kills enemies in combat is performing a legitimate duty.<ref>Jindal pp. 89\u201390; Laidlaw pp. 154\u2013155; Jaini, Padmanabh S.: ''Ahimsa and \"Just War\" in Jainism'', in: ''Ahimsa, Anekanta and Jainism'', ed.

[[Parshvanatha]] and [[Mahavira]], the two historical teachers of Jainism, had large numbers of female devotees and ascetics.{{sfn|Balbir|p=122}} Tirthankara Mahavira and Jain monks are credited with raising the [[status of women]].{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=147-148}}\n\n== Religious texts ==\nHindus do not accept any Jain text and Jains do not recognize any Hindu scripture.{{sfn|George|2008|p=318}}{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=136}}\n\n=== The Vedas ===\nThe scriptures known as [[Vedas]] are regarded by Hindus as one of the foundations of [[Hinduism]]. Those who rejected the Vedas as the prime source of religious knowledge were labeled \"[[\u0100stika and n\u0101stika|n\u0101stika]]\".{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}} As a consequence, Jainism and Buddhism were categorized as ''n\u0101stika [[dar\u015bana]]''.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}}\n\nThe orthodox schools of Hinduism, such as [[Vedanta]], [[Mimamsa]] and [[Samkhya]], claim the [[Sruti]] do not have any author and hence are supreme to other religious scriptures. This position was countered by Jains who said that saying Vedas are authorless was equivalent to saying that anonymous poems are written by nobody. [[Jain scriptures]], on the contrary, were believed by them to be of human origin, brought through omniscient teachers, and hence claimed greater worth.{{sfn|Dundas|p=234}} According to Jains, the origin of Vedas lies with [[Marichi]], the son of [[Bharata Chakravarti]], who was the son of the first Tirthankara Rishabha. Jains maintain that these scriptures were later modified.{{sfn|Feynes|p=xxiv}}{{sfn|Glasenapp|p=497}} Jains pointed that Hindus do not know their own scriptures since they were unaware of the names of tirthankaras present in Vedas.{{sfn|Dundas|p=234}}\n\nJains had a long-standing debate with [[Mimamsa]] school of Hinduism. [[Kumarila Bhatta]], a proponent of Mimamsa school, argued that the Vedas are the source of all knowledge and it is through them that humans can differentiate between right and wrong. Jain monks, such as [[Haribhadra]], held that humans are already in possession of all the knowledge, which only needs to be illuminated or uncovered in order to gain the status of omniscience.{{sfn|Olle|2006|p=91}}\n\n==== Vedic sacrifices ====\nThe practice of Vedic animal sacrifices was opposed by Jains.{{sfn|George|2008|p=318}} [[Hemachandra]], a Jain monk, cites passages from [[Manusmriti]], one of the law book of Hindus, to demonstrate how, in light of false scriptures, Hindus have resorted to violence. [[Akalanka]], another Jain monk, sarcastically said that if killing can result in enlightenment, one should become a hunter or fisherman.{{sfn|Dundas|p=234}}\n\n===Hindu epics and Jain counter epics===\nThe rejection of Hindu epics and scriptures were dominant in Jainism since very early times.{{sfn|George|2008|p=318}} The central Hindu scriptures and epics like Vedas, Mahabharata and Ramayana are categorized as false scriptures in Nandi-sutra,{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=237}}{{Verify source|date=December 2013}}{{sfn|Iyengar|p=62}} one of the svetambara's canonical literature. Later, Jains adapted various Hindu epics in accordance with their own system.{{sfn|Schubring|p=17}}{{sfn|Jaini|p=305}}{{sfn|Glasenapp|p=497}} There were disputes between Jains and Hindus in form of these epics.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dmOUq73LZLgC&pg=PA359&lpg=PA359&dq=jains+on+mahabharata&source=bl&ots=HkxVSXGt3J&sig=ACfU3U1Pa9Dd1p9uWJp1JjF8F32ipD629w&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiHvbXHuofnAhXiw1kKHY2SCY44ChDoATAAegQIChAB#v=onepage&q=jains%20on%20mahabharata&f=false|title=Epic India, Or, India as Described in the Mahabharata and the Ramayana|last=Vaidya|first=Chintaman Vinayak|date=2001|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-1564-9|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Jains and Hindu Gods ==\n{{see also|Rama in Jainism|Rishabha (Hinduism)}}\nWithin the doctrine of Jainism, the ''tirthankara'' holds the highest status. Hemachandra says that a ''deva'' (roughly god) is the one who has conquered his internal desires and passions. This requirement, according to him, was fulfilled only by the tirthankara. The gods of Hindus are considered worldly having desires for women and weapons. Hence their path for spiritual upliftment and salvation is rejected by the [[Jains]].\n\nSome personage mentioned in the Vedas and Jain scriptures are same. There is mention of the first tirthankara, [[Rishabhanatha]] in [[Rig Veda]] and Vishnu Purana. Rig Veda, X. 12. 166 states{{sfn|Jain|1929|p=74}}- {{cquote|0 Rudra-like Divinity ! do thou produce amongst us, of high descent, a Great God, like Rishabha Deva, by becoming Arhan, which is the epithet of the first World Teacher; let Him become the destroyer of the enemies !}}\n\nVishnu Pur\u0101na mentions:\n:\u090b\u0937\u092d\u094b \u092e\u0930\u0941\u0926\u0947\u0935\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0936\u094d\u091a \u090b\u0937\u092d\u093e\u0924 \u092d\u0930\u0924\u094b \u092d\u0935\u0947\u0924\u094d\n:\u092d\u0930\u0924\u093e\u0926 \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0902 \u0935\u0930\u094d\u0937\u0902, \u092d\u0930\u0924\u093e\u0924 \u0938\u0941\u092e\u0924\u093f\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0935\u092d\u0942\u0924\u094d\n:Rishabha was born to Marudevi, Bharata was born to Rishabh,\n:Bharatavarsha (India) arose from Bharata, and Sumati arose from Bharata.\n::\u2014Vishnu Purana (2,1,31)\n\nIn the [[Skanda Purana]] (chapter 37) it is stated that \"Rishabha was the son of [[Nabhiraja]], and Rishabha had a son named Bharata, and after the name of this Bharata, this country is known as Bharata-varsha.\"{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=106}}\n\nIn the \"Brahmottara-candam\" section of the ''[[Brahma Purana]]'', the narrator Suta describes many matters relating to Shaivism and in the 16th portion, there is a story about Bhadrabahu receiving instructions in a mantra from Rishabha yogi.<ref>P. 88, ''Madras Journal of Literature and Science'', Volume 11 By Madras Literary Society and Auxiliary of the Royal Asiatic Society</ref>\n\nThe ''Linga Purana'' mentions that in every kali yuga, Lord Shiva has incarnated, and that in one kali yuga he was a Yogeshwara (one of His 28 incarnations) named Rishabha.<ref>P. 16 ''Linga Purana'' By Vinay.

''Sramana'' or ''Aarahata'' tradition.{{sfn|George|2008|p=317-318}}\n\n===Ancient===\nJains and Hindus have coexisted in [[Tamilakam|Tamil country]] since at least the second century BCE.{{sfn|John E. Cort|1998|p=187}}\n\n===Medieval===\nCompetition between Jains and [[Brahman]]s, between Jains and [[Shaiva]]s, is a frequent motif of all medieval western Indian narratives, but the two communities for the most part coexisted and coprospered.{{sfn|John E. Cort|1998|p=87}} Shaiva kings patronised Jain mendicants, and Jain officials patronised Brahmana poets.{{sfn|John E.

The Vaishnavism and Shaivism also began to rise. This was particularly in the southern Indian states.{{sfn|Glasenapp|1999|p=70}}\n\nAccording to a Saivite legend, the Pandya king [[Koon Pandiyan]] ordered a massacre of 8,000 Jain monks.

It is quite difficult to differentiate a lay Jain from a lay Hindu.{{sfn|Glasenapp|1999|p=493}} The Jain code of conduct is quite similar to that which is found in Hindu Dharmasashtra, Manusmriti and other Law books of Brahmans.{{sfn|Glasenapp|1999|p=494}} Many Jains now worship Hindu gods and celebrate Hindu festivals.{{sfn|Glasenapp|1999|p=494}}{{sfn|Babb|pp=3-4}} The difference in the rituals of practitioners of the two religions would be that the Jains do not give any importance to bathing in holy water.{{sfn|Glasenapp|1999|p=494}} According to religious scholar M. Whitney Kelting, some of the \"names and narratives\" in the Hindu's list of satis are also found in the Jain tradition.{{sfn|Keilting|2006|p=183}} In the Hindu context, a sati is a virtuous wife who protects her husband and his family and has the \"intention to die before, or with,\" her husband.{{sfn|Keilting|2006|p=183}} Kelting notes that those satis who die on the funeral pyre of their husband, or who \"intended to die\" but were prevented from death, may attain a status called satimata.{{sfn|Keilting|2006|p=183}}{{sfn|Keilting|2009|p=22}} Kelting says that the Jain tradition, due to principle of non-violence and equanimity, doesn't allow self-immolation.{{sfn|Keilting|2009|p=21}}{{sfn|Keilting|2006|p=183}} They, instead, see renunciation rather than self-sacrifice as the highest ideal for a Jain sati.{{sfn|Keilting|2006|p=183}} Hindus think Jainism is simply another branch of Hinduism.{{sfn|Glasenapp|1999|p=494}} Jain apologist like [[Champat Rai Jain]], held that Hindus are Jaina [[allegorists]] who have allegorised the Jain teachings.{{sfn|Jain|1929|p=154}}{{sfn|Glasenapp|1999|p=497}} However, such claims are not supported by historical facts.{{sfn|Glasenapp|1999|p=497}}\n\n===Hindu revivalism and Indian identities===\nWith the onset of British colonialism, select groups of Indians developed responses to the British dominance and the British critique of Hinduism.{{sfn|Rambachan|1994|p=38}} In this context, various responses toward Jainism developed.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n====Dayanand Saraswati and the Arya Samaj====\nThe Arya Samaj was founded by [[Dayanand Saraswati]] (1824-1883), who \"was the solitary champion of Vedic authority and infallibility\".{{sfn|Rambachan|1994|p=38}} Swami Dayanand Saraswati authored Satyarth Prakash,{{sfn|Panicker|2006|p=38}} a book containing the basic teachings of Saraswati and the Arya Samaj.{{sfn|Panicker|2006|p=38-39}} It contains \"Dayananda's bitter criticisms of the major ''non-Vedic'' religions of Indian origins.\"{{sfn|Panicker|2006|p=39}} In the ''[[Satyarth Prakash]]'', he writes that he regarded Jainism as \"the most dreadful religion\",{{sfn|Daniel|2000|p=92}} and that Jains are \"possessed of defective and childish understanding.\"{{sfn|Daniel|2000|p=92}}{{refn|group=note|Daniels cites Dayanand in his investigation of the claim that \"Hinduism is the most tolerant of all religions and Hindu tolerance is the best answer in fostering peace and harmony in a multi-religious society\",<ref name=\"EBC\">[http://www.easternbookcorporation.com/moreinfo.php?txt_searchstring=3165 Eastern Book Company, ''About the Book: , Hindu Response to Religious Pluralism'' (P.S.

There are some similarities and differences between the two religions.{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=135-136}} Temples, gods, rituals, fasts and other religious components of Jainism are different from those of Hinduism.{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=138}}\n\n\"Jain\" is derived from the word ''Jina'', referring to a human being who has conquered all inner passions (like anger, attachment, greed and pride) and possesses [[Kevala Jnana]] (pure infinite knowledge). Followers of the path shown by the Jinas are called Jains.{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=15}}{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=164}} Followers of Hinduism are called Hindus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Hinduism|title=Hinduism|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref>\n\n== Philosophical similarities and differences ==\nJainism and Hinduism have many similar characteristic features, including the concepts of ''[[samsara]]'', ''[[karma]]'' and ''[[moksha]]''. However, they differ over the precise nature and meaning of these concepts. The doctrine of Jainism has minor similarities with the Nyaya-Vaisheshika and samkhya school. The Jain doctrine teaches atomism which is also found in the Vaisheshika system and atheism which is found in Samkhya.{{sfn|Glasenapp|1999|p=496}} Within the doctrine of Jainism, there exist many metaphysical concepts which are not known in Hinduism, some of which are ''dharma'' and Adharma tattva (which are seen as substances within the Jain metaphysical system), [[Gunasthana]]s and [[Lesya]]s.{{sfn|Glasenapp|1999|p=496}} The epistemological concepts of [[Anekantavada]] and Syadvada are not found in the Hindu system. There were, in the past, attempts made to merge the concepts of Hindu gods and the Tirthankara of Jainism. The cosmography of Hindus resembles that of the Jains and there are similar names of heavenly gods within these systems.{{sfn|Glasenapp|1999|p=497}}\n\nIn the [[Upanishads]], there also occur the first statements of the view, dominant in Jainist teachings and elsewhere, that rebirth is undesirable and that it is possible by controlling or stopping one's actions to put an end to it and attain a state of deliverance (moksha) which lies beyond action.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=15}}\n\n===Moksha (liberation) ===\nIn Hinduism, [[moksha]] means merging of soul with universal soul or eternal being and escaping the cycle of births and deaths; in Jainism, it is action-less and peaceful existence. In Vedic philosophy or Sanatana Dharma, salvation is giving up the sense of being a doer and realizing Self to be the same as Universe and God.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-yaOxgEACAAJ&dq=moksha&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiy7OTeuYfnAhXwUN8KHbDaDL0Q6AEwCXoECAcQAQ|title=Moksha: Self-Liberation Through Self-Knowledge|last=Kajaria|first=Vish|date=2019-02-13|publisher=Independently Published|isbn=978-1-09-791542-2|language=en}}</ref> In Jainism, salvation can be achieved only through self-effort and is considered to be the right of human beings.{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=137}}\n\nIn Jainism, one definite path to attain liberation ([[Moksha (Jainism)|moksha]]) is prescribed. The prescribed threefold path consists of the [[Ratnatraya|three jewels of Jainism]] (Right belief, Right knowledge, Right conduct). In Hinduism, no one definite path to salvation is prescribed.{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p = 137}}\n\n=== Universe ===\n{{Further information|Jainism and non-creationism}}\nAccording to [[Jain cosmology]], the universe is eternal, it is neither created nor it can be destroyed. In Hinduism, it is believed to by a creator, and destroyed by God, to be created again. {{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=137}}\n\n=== Karma ===\n{{further information|Karma in Jainism|Karma in Hinduism}}\nKarma is an invisible force in Hinduism, whereas in Jainism it is a form of matter which can stick to the soul.{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=137}}\n\n=== Worship ===\nIn Hinduism, Gods are worshiped in several ways and for several reasons such as knowledge, peace, wisdom, health, and it also believed to be one's duty to pray god as God is considered as our maker (as we originated from them and we are staying in them and at last will merge with them), for moksham (by attaining moksham we can join him and escape this Maya or dualistic nature which makes us think that we are different from the universal soul) and are also offered food as a respect, etc.{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=137}}{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p=181}} In Jainism, the siddhas represent the true goal of all human beings,{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p=182}} their qualities are worshiped by the Jains.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n=== Self-defence and soldiering ===\nJains agree with Hindus that violence in self-defence can be justified,<ref>''Nisithabhasya'' (in ''Nisithasutra'') 289; Jinadatta Suri: ''Upadesharasayana'' 26; Dundas pp. 162\u2013163; T\u00e4htinen p. 31.</ref> and they agree that a soldier who kills enemies in combat is performing a legitimate duty.<ref>Jindal pp. 89\u201390; Laidlaw pp. 154\u2013155; Jaini, Padmanabh S.: ''Ahimsa and \"Just War\" in Jainism'', in: ''Ahimsa, Anekanta and Jainism'', ed.

[[Parshvanatha]] and [[Mahavira]], the two historical teachers of Jainism, had large numbers of female devotees and ascetics.{{sfn|Balbir|p=122}} Tirthankara Mahavira and Jain monks are credited with raising the [[status of women]].{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=147-148}}\n\n== Religious texts ==\nHindus do not accept any Jain text and Jains do not recognize any Hindu scripture.{{sfn|George|2008|p=318}}{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=136}}\n\n=== The Vedas ===\nThe scriptures known as [[Vedas]] are regarded by Hindus as one of the foundations of [[Hinduism]]. Those who rejected the Vedas as the prime source of religious knowledge were labeled \"[[\u0100stika and n\u0101stika|n\u0101stika]]\".{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}} As a consequence, Jainism and Buddhism were categorized as ''n\u0101stika [[dar\u015bana]]''.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}}\n\nThe orthodox schools of Hinduism, such as [[Vedanta]], [[Mimamsa]] and [[Samkhya]], claim the [[Sruti]] do not have any author and hence are supreme to other religious scriptures. This position was countered by Jains who said that saying Vedas are authorless was equivalent to saying that anonymous poems are written by nobody. [[Jain scriptures]], on the contrary, were believed by them to be of human origin, brought through omniscient teachers, and hence claimed greater worth.{{sfn|Dundas|p=234}} According to Jains, the origin of Vedas lies with [[Marichi]], the son of [[Bharata Chakravarti]], who was the son of the first Tirthankara Rishabha. Jains maintain that these scriptures were later modified.{{sfn|Feynes|p=xxiv}}{{sfn|Glasenapp|p=497}} Jains pointed that Hindus do not know their own scriptures since they were unaware of the names of tirthankaras present in Vedas.{{sfn|Dundas|p=234}}\n\nJains had a long-standing debate with [[Mimamsa]] school of Hinduism. [[Kumarila Bhatta]], a proponent of Mimamsa school, argued that the Vedas are the source of all knowledge and it is through them that humans can differentiate between right and wrong. Jain monks, such as [[Haribhadra]], held that humans are already in possession of all the knowledge, which only needs to be illuminated or uncovered in order to gain the status of omniscience.{{sfn|Olle|2006|p=91}}\n\n==== Vedic sacrifices ====\nThe practice of Vedic animal sacrifices was opposed by Jains.{{sfn|George|2008|p=318}} [[Hemachandra]], a Jain monk, cites passages from [[Manusmriti]], one of the law book of Hindus, to demonstrate how, in light of false scriptures, Hindus have resorted to violence. [[Akalanka]], another Jain monk, sarcastically said that if killing can result in enlightenment, one should become a hunter or fisherman.{{sfn|Dundas|p=234}}\n\n===Hindu epics and Jain counter epics===\nThe rejection of Hindu epics and scriptures were dominant in Jainism since very early times.{{sfn|George|2008|p=318}} The central Hindu scriptures and epics like Vedas, Mahabharata and Ramayana are categorized as false scriptures in Nandi-sutra,{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=237}}{{Verify source|date=December 2013}}{{sfn|Iyengar|p=62}} one of the svetambara's canonical literature. Later, Jains adapted various Hindu epics in accordance with their own system.{{sfn|Schubring|p=17}}{{sfn|Jaini|p=305}}{{sfn|Glasenapp|p=497}} There were disputes between Jains and Hindus in form of these epics.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dmOUq73LZLgC&pg=PA359&lpg=PA359&dq=jains+on+mahabharata&source=bl&ots=HkxVSXGt3J&sig=ACfU3U1Pa9Dd1p9uWJp1JjF8F32ipD629w&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiHvbXHuofnAhXiw1kKHY2SCY44ChDoATAAegQIChAB#v=onepage&q=jains%20on%20mahabharata&f=false|title=Epic India, Or, India as Described in the Mahabharata and the Ramayana|last=Vaidya|first=Chintaman Vinayak|date=2001|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-1564-9|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Jains and Hindu Gods ==\n{{see also|Rama in Jainism|Rishabha (Hinduism)}}\nWithin the doctrine of Jainism, the ''tirthankara'' holds the highest status. Hemachandra says that a ''deva'' (roughly god) is the one who has conquered his internal desires and passions. This requirement, according to him, was fulfilled only by the tirthankara. The gods of Hindus are considered worldly having desires for women and weapons. Hence their path for spiritual upliftment and salvation is rejected by the [[Jains]].\n\nSome personage mentioned in the Vedas and Jain scriptures are same. There is mention of the first tirthankara, [[Rishabhanatha]] in [[Rig Veda]] and Vishnu Purana. Rig Veda, X. 12. 166 states{{sfn|Jain|1929|p=74}}- {{cquote|0 Rudra-like Divinity ! do thou produce amongst us, of high descent, a Great God, like Rishabha Deva, by becoming Arhan, which is the epithet of the first World Teacher; let Him become the destroyer of the enemies !}}\n\nVishnu Pur\u0101na mentions:\n:\u090b\u0937\u092d\u094b \u092e\u0930\u0941\u0926\u0947\u0935\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0936\u094d\u091a \u090b\u0937\u092d\u093e\u0924 \u092d\u0930\u0924\u094b \u092d\u0935\u0947\u0924\u094d\n:\u092d\u0930\u0924\u093e\u0926 \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0902 \u0935\u0930\u094d\u0937\u0902, \u092d\u0930\u0924\u093e\u0924 \u0938\u0941\u092e\u0924\u093f\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0935\u092d\u0942\u0924\u094d\n:Rishabha was born to Marudevi, Bharata was born to Rishabh,\n:Bharatavarsha (India) arose from Bharata, and Sumati arose from Bharata.\n::\u2014Vishnu Purana (2,1,31)\n\nIn the [[Skanda Purana]] (chapter 37) it is stated that \"Rishabha was the son of [[Nabhiraja]], and Rishabha had a son named Bharata, and after the name of this Bharata, this country is known as Bharata-varsha.\"{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=106}}\n\nIn the \"Brahmottara-candam\" section of the ''[[Brahma Purana]]'', the narrator Suta describes many matters relating to Shaivism and in the 16th portion, there is a story about Bhadrabahu receiving instructions in a mantra from Rishabha yogi.<ref>P. 88, ''Madras Journal of Literature and Science'', Volume 11 By Madras Literary Society and Auxiliary of the Royal Asiatic Society</ref>\n\nThe ''Linga Purana'' mentions that in every kali yuga, Lord Shiva has incarnated, and that in one kali yuga he was a Yogeshwara (one of His 28 incarnations) named Rishabha.<ref>P. 16 ''Linga Purana'' By Vinay.

The Vaishnavism and Shaivism also began to rise. This was particularly in the southern Indian states.{{sfn|Glasenapp|1999|p=70}}\n\nAccording to a Saivite legend, the Pandya king [[Koon Pandiyan]] ordered a massacre of 8,000 Jain monks.

It is quite difficult to differentiate a lay Jain from a lay Hindu.{{sfn|Glasenapp|1999|p=493}} The Jain code of conduct is quite similar to that which is found in Hindu Dharmasashtra, Manusmriti and other Law books of Brahmans.{{sfn|Glasenapp|1999|p=494}} Many Jains now worship Hindu gods and celebrate Hindu festivals.{{sfn|Glasenapp|1999|p=494}}{{sfn|Babb|pp=3-4}} The difference in the rituals of practitioners of the two religions would be that the Jains do not give any importance to bathing in holy water.{{sfn|Glasenapp|1999|p=494}} According to religious scholar M. Whitney Kelting, some of the \"names and narratives\" in the Hindu's list of satis are also found in the Jain tradition.{{sfn|Keilting|2006|p=183}} In the Hindu context, a sati is a virtuous wife who protects her husband and his family and has the \"intention to die before, or with,\" her husband.{{sfn|Keilting|2006|p=183}} Kelting notes that those satis who die on the funeral pyre of their husband, or who \"intended to die\" but were prevented from death, may attain a status called satimata.{{sfn|Keilting|2006|p=183}}{{sfn|Keilting|2009|p=22}} Kelting says that the Jain tradition, due to principle of non-violence and equanimity, doesn't allow self-immolation.{{sfn|Keilting|2009|p=21}}{{sfn|Keilting|2006|p=183}} They, instead, see renunciation rather than self-sacrifice as the highest ideal for a Jain sati.{{sfn|Keilting|2006|p=183}} Hindus think Jainism is simply another branch of Hinduism.{{sfn|Glasenapp|1999|p=494}} Jain apologist like [[Champat Rai Jain]], held that Hindus are Jaina [[allegorists]] who have allegorised the Jain teachings.{{sfn|Jain|1929|p=154}}{{sfn|Glasenapp|1999|p=497}} However, such claims are not supported by historical facts.{{sfn|Glasenapp|1999|p=497}}\n\n===Hindu revivalism and Indian identities===\nWith the onset of British colonialism, select groups of Indians developed responses to the British dominance and the British critique of Hinduism.{{sfn|Rambachan|1994|p=38}} In this context, various responses toward Jainism developed.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n====Dayanand Saraswati and the Arya Samaj====\nThe Arya Samaj was founded by [[Dayanand Saraswati]] (1824-1883), who \"was the solitary champion of Vedic authority and infallibility\".{{sfn|Rambachan|1994|p=38}} Swami Dayanand Saraswati authored Satyarth Prakash,{{sfn|Panicker|2006|p=38}} a book containing the basic teachings of Saraswati and the Arya Samaj.{{sfn|Panicker|2006|p=38-39}} It contains \"Dayananda's bitter criticisms of the major ''non-Vedic'' religions of Indian origins.\"{{sfn|Panicker|2006|p=39}} In the ''[[Satyarth Prakash]]'', he writes that he regarded Jainism as \"the most dreadful religion\",{{sfn|Daniel|2000|p=92}} and that Jains are \"possessed of defective and childish understanding.\"{{sfn|Daniel|2000|p=92}}{{refn|group=note|Daniels cites Dayanand in his investigation of the claim that \"Hinduism is the most tolerant of all religions and Hindu tolerance is the best answer in fostering peace and harmony in a multi-religious society\",<ref name=\"EBC\">[http://www.easternbookcorporation.com/moreinfo.php?txt_searchstring=3165 Eastern Book Company, ''About the Book: , Hindu Response to Religious Pluralism'' (P.S.

The German government and several health officials stated that the country was well prepared and at first saw no need in taking special measures to stock up or to limit public freedom.

Two days later, borders to neighbouring countries were closed. On 22 March, the government announced a national curfew, almost identical to those in to Austria and Bavaria, where it had been implemented seven days and three days before, respectively.

Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a Corona virus pandemic.

A \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\" - all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\".

Regional health departments initially reported data to the state health department which transferred data to the federal health department, many but not all on the day of receiving them. Reporting switched from manual to electronic. The Robert Koch Institute releases official numbers with an additional delay of several days. Cases reported by federal health departments are added earlier to a project by [[Funke Mediengruppe]], to which [[Berliner Morgenpost]] belongs.

Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a Corona virus pandemic. A risk analysis predicted how dangerous a global coronavirus outbreak could be. It was described as: \"Children [\u2026] have [\u2026] minor disease progressions\", \"the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". A \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\" - all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". The {{ill|Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance|de|Bundesamt f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe}} (BBK) never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation.<ref name=\"frontal\">{{Cite news |author-first1=Andreas |author-last1=Halbach |author-first2=Thomas |author-last2=M\u00fcnten |author-first3=Heiko |author-last3=Rahms |title=Vers\u00e4umte Pandemie-Vorsorge |language=de |date=2020-03-24 |work=ZDF Frontal 21}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n=== Robert Koch Institute ===\nThe [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) lists current numbers of registered cases in Germany and other countries online.

Starting 10 March 2020, due to continuously rising case numbers, RKI stopped manually updating the numbers and switched to adopting the numbers that were electronically transmitted.

Regional health departments initially reported data to the state health department which transferred data to the federal health department, many but not all on the day of receiving them. Reporting switched from manual to electronic. The Robert Koch Institute releases official numbers with an additional delay of several days. Cases reported by federal health departments are added earlier to a project by [[Funke Mediengruppe]], to which [[Berliner Morgenpost]] belongs. [[Johns Hopkins University]] seems to use the numbers of the Funke project for Germany indirectly while the Funke project uses numbers of Johns Hopkins University for other countries.<ref>{{cite news |title=RKI rechtfertigt sich \u2013 und h\u00e4lt sich bei einer Frage konsequent zur\u00fcck |url=https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article206783949/Coronavirus-RKI-rechtfertigt-sich-und-haelt-sich-dann-konsequent-zurueck.html |accessdate=25 March 2020 |publisher=Welt |date=25 March 2020 |ref=WELT2503}}</ref>\n\nThe number of unknown cases could be tenfold according to some virologists.

Patterns are drawn with pencil and later redrawn using hot wax, usually made from a mixture of [[Alkane|paraffin]] or [[beeswax]], sometimes mixed with plant resins, which functions as a dye-resist. The wax can be applied with a variety of tools. A pen-like instrument called a ''[[canting]]'' ({{IPA-jv|t\u0283anti\u014b}}, sometimes spelled with [[Van Ophuijsen Spelling System|old Dutch orthography]] ''tjanting'') is the most common. A ''tjanting'' is made from a small copper reservoir with a spout on a wooden handle. The reservoir holds the resist which flows through the spout, creating dots and lines as it moves. For larger patterns, a stiff brush may be used.<ref name=\"rita\">Trefois, Rita (2010).

It is worn by wrapping it around the hip, or made into a hat known as [[blangkon]]. The cloth can be filled continuously with a single pattern or divided into several sections.\n\nCertain patterns are only used in certain sections of the cloth. For example, a row of [[isosceles triangle]]s, forming the ''pasung'' motif, as well as diagonal floral motifs called ''dhlorong'', are commonly used for the head. However, ''pasung'' and ''dhlorong'' are occasionally found in the body. Other motifs such as ''buketan'' (flower bouquet) and birds are commonly used in either the head or the body.<ref name=br/>\n\n* The head is a rectangular section of the cloth which is worn at the front. The head section can be at the middle of the cloth, or placed at one or both ends. The ''papan'' inside of the head can be used to determine whether the cloth is ''kain panjang'' or sarong.<ref name=br/>\n* The body is the main part of the cloth, and is filled with a wide variety of patterns. The body can be divided into two alternating patterns and colours called ''pagi-sore'' ('dawn-dusk'). Brighter pattern are shown during the day, while darker pattern are shown in the evening. The alternating colours give the impression of two batik sets.<ref name=br/>\n* Margins are often plain, but floral and lace-like patterns, as well as wavy lines described as a dragon, are common in the area beside ''seret''.<ref name=br/>\n\n====Types====\nAs each region has its own traditional pattern, batiks are commonly distinguished by the region they originated in, such as batik [[Surakarta|Solo]], batik [[Yogyakarta]], batik [[Pekalongan]], and batik [[Madura]]. Batiks from Java can be distinguished by their general pattern and colours into ''batik pedalaman'' (inland batik) or ''batik pesisir'' (coastal batik). Batiks which do not fall neatly into one of these two categories are only referred to by their region.

One of the earlier sightings are to be found in Egypt, where batik was used in the embalming of mummies. The most developed resist-dyeing skills are to be found in Nigeria where the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] make [[Adire (textile art)|adire]] cloths. Two methods of resist are used: ''adire eleso'' which involves tied and stitched designs and ''adire eleko'' that uses starch paste. The paste is most often made from cassava starch, rice, and other ingredients boiled together to produce a smooth thick paste. The Yoruba of West Africa use cassava paste as a resist while the [[Soninke people|Soninke]] and [[Wolof people|Wolof]] people in Senegal uses rice paste. The Bamana people of Mali use mud as a resist.<ref name=\"BGAfrica\"/> Batik was worn as a symbol of status, ethnic origin, marriage, cultural events, etc.\n\n[[African wax prints]] (Dutch wax prints) was introduced during the colonial era, through Dutch's textile industry's effort to imitate the batik making process.

Patterns are drawn with pencil and later redrawn using hot wax, usually made from a mixture of [[Alkane|paraffin]] or [[beeswax]], sometimes mixed with plant resins, which functions as a dye-resist. The wax can be applied with a variety of tools. A pen-like instrument called a ''[[canting]]'' ({{IPA-jv|t\u0283anti\u014b}}, sometimes spelled with [[Van Ophuijsen Spelling System|old Dutch orthography]] ''tjanting'') is the most common. A ''tjanting'' is made from a small copper reservoir with a spout on a wooden handle. The reservoir holds the resist which flows through the spout, creating dots and lines as it moves. For larger patterns, a stiff brush may be used.<ref name=\"rita\">Trefois, Rita (2010).

It is worn by wrapping it around the hip, or made into a hat known as [[blangkon]]. The cloth can be filled continuously with a single pattern or divided into several sections.\n\nCertain patterns are only used in certain sections of the cloth. For example, a row of [[isosceles triangle]]s, forming the ''pasung'' motif, as well as diagonal floral motifs called ''dhlorong'', are commonly used for the head. However, ''pasung'' and ''dhlorong'' are occasionally found in the body. Other motifs such as ''buketan'' (flower bouquet) and birds are commonly used in either the head or the body.<ref name=br/>\n\n* The head is a rectangular section of the cloth which is worn at the front. The head section can be at the middle of the cloth, or placed at one or both ends. The ''papan'' inside of the head can be used to determine whether the cloth is ''kain panjang'' or sarong.<ref name=br/>\n* The body is the main part of the cloth, and is filled with a wide variety of patterns. The body can be divided into two alternating patterns and colours called ''pagi-sore'' ('dawn-dusk'). Brighter pattern are shown during the day, while darker pattern are shown in the evening. The alternating colours give the impression of two batik sets.<ref name=br/>\n* Margins are often plain, but floral and lace-like patterns, as well as wavy lines described as a dragon, are common in the area beside ''seret''.<ref name=br/>\n\n====Types====\nAs each region has its own traditional pattern, batiks are commonly distinguished by the region they originated in, such as batik [[Surakarta|Solo]], batik [[Yogyakarta]], batik [[Pekalongan]], and batik [[Madura]]. Batiks from Java can be distinguished by their general pattern and colours into ''batik pedalaman'' (inland batik) or ''batik pesisir'' (coastal batik). Batiks which do not fall neatly into one of these two categories are only referred to by their region.

The colours also tend to be lighter and more vibrant than deep coloured Javanese batik. The most popular motifs are leaves and flowers.

One of the earlier sightings are to be found in Egypt, where batik was used in the embalming of mummies. The most developed resist-dyeing skills are to be found in Nigeria where the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] make [[Adire (textile art)|adire]] cloths. Two methods of resist are used: ''adire eleso'' which involves tied and stitched designs and ''adire eleko'' that uses starch paste. The paste is most often made from cassava starch, rice, and other ingredients boiled together to produce a smooth thick paste. The Yoruba of West Africa use cassava paste as a resist while the [[Soninke people|Soninke]] and [[Wolof people|Wolof]] people in Senegal uses rice paste. The Bamana people of Mali use mud as a resist.<ref name=\"BGAfrica\"/> Batik was worn as a symbol of status, ethnic origin, marriage, cultural events, etc.\n\n[[African wax prints]] (Dutch wax prints) was introduced during the colonial era, through Dutch's textile industry's effort to imitate the batik making process.

It is portrayed as being able to change its shape to disguise its body as an inanimate object, commonly a chest. The mimic has a powerful adhesive that holds fast to creatures that touch it, allowing the mimic to beat its victims with its powerful pseudopods. The mimic was introduced in the [[Advanced Dungeons & Dragons|first edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'']] game's original ''[[Monster Manual#1st Edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons|Monster Manual]]''. The mimic has appeared in subsequent editions. Several variants of the creature have been introduced, with a variety of abilities and sizes.\n\n==Publication history==\n===''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' 1st edition===\nThe mimic made its first appearance in the original ''[[Monster Manual#1st Edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons|Monster Manual]]'' (1977), by [[Gary Gygax]]. This book described mimics as \"subterranean creatures which cannot stand the light of the sun. They are able to perfectly mimic stone or wood.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gygax|first=Gary|title=Advanced D&D: Monster Manual|publisher=TSR Games|year=1979|isbn=0-935696-00-8|location=Lake Geneva, WI|pages=70}}</ref> According to the book, mimics thus pose as items such as stonework, doors, or chests; when a character or creature touches the disguised mimic, the mimic can lash out with a bludgeoning pseudopod. A mimic excretes an adhesive glue to hold fast whatever touches it. The book states that all mimics move about constantly in search of prey. Mimics are described as [[Neutral (Dungeons & Dragons)|neutral]] in [[Alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)|alignment]].\n\nThe ''Monster Manual'' mentions that there are two types of mimic encountered in the game. The slightly smaller version is more intelligent, and is generally friendly if offered food, usually telling a [[player character]] about what it has seen nearby. These creatures have their own language and can usually speak several other tongues. The book described the larger variety of mimic as a carnivorous creature called a \"killer mimic\". This creature does not speak, and will attack anything which is nearby.<ref>[[Gary Gygax|Gygax, Gary]]. ''[[Monster Manual#1st Edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons|Monster Manual]]'' ([[TSR, Inc.|TSR]], 1979)</ref> The ''Monster Manual'' was reviewed by [[Don Turnbull (game designer)|Don Turnbull]] in the British magazine ''[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]'' No. 8 (August/September 1978). As part of his review, Turnbull comments on several new monsters introduced in the book, referring to the mimic as a thing which adventurers from his Greenlands dungeon \"are not going to be best placed to meet\".<ref name=\"WD8\">{{cite journal|title=Open Box|authorlink=Don Turnbull (game designer)|last=Turnbull|first=Don|journal=[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]|issue=8|date=August\u2013September 1978|pages=16\u201317}}</ref>\n\nThe July 1983 issue of ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' magazine (No. 75) featured the article \"The Ecology of the Mimic\", by [[Ed Greenwood]]. This article provides additional in-game descriptions of the mimic, with the information purported as having come from \"the Journals of Maerlun the Scholar\". The article states that a mimic's hide is naturally gray in hue, with a smooth very hard outer skin that appears stone-like; a mimic is able to change the color and texture of its outer surface to resemble wood-grain by shifting a brown pigmented liquid between its interior and exterior body cells to fill the many capillaries lying just beneath the skin surface, while the creature can empty these capillaries to revert to its normal stone-like appearance. A mimic is amorphous, able to alter the external configuration of its form at will, and the more intelligent ones can even assume the shape of a partition wall, overhanging arch, or rough rock wall; this feat is accomplished by the creature's mode of travel, which involves extending its strong pseudopods, which exude a sticky \"glue\", and pulling itself along (\"unsticking\" its own glue at will), traveling on walls and ceilings as easily as it can on floors. The article also describes how a mimic observes its surroundings through its very sensitive \"eyespots\" (patches of pigment that are sensitive to heat, light, and vibration) all over its skin; bright sunlight effectively blinds a mimic by overwhelming these sensory spots, which is why mimics are almost always found in areas where the sun never reaches.<ref>[[Ed Greenwood|Greenwood, Ed]]. \"The Ecology of the Mimic.\" ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' No. 75 (TSR, 1983)</ref> Austin Wood of [[PC Gamer]] described Greenwood's article as \"probably the closest thing to science to ever come out of D&D\".<ref name=\"PCGamer\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/the-murderous-history-of-mimics/|work=[[PC Gamer]]|title=The murderous history of mimics|last=Wood|first=Austin|date=3 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe monster collection \"Creature Catalog III\" in ''Dragon'' No. 101 (September 1985) featured a creature by contributor Gregory Detwiler known as the '''metal mimic'''. The entry states that a metal mimic is a more powerful relative of the \"ordinary\" mimic, with all of the mimic's basic abilities and characteristics, but being able to imitate metal, in addition to being able to imitate wood and stone. The metal mimic can take on the shape and appearance of items of any raw or finished metal, which includes the color, luster, and texture of any pure metal (such as iron, gold, silver, or platinum) except for adamantite, but cannot form into any alloy. A metal mimic can also create a magical illumination from itself or from any nearby object. A metal mimic can exude a pseudopod in the form of a sword or dagger; such extremities will appear to be a valuable enchanted blade, to lure prey. According to this entry, metal mimics come in two types: the larger, non-belligerent type which may be willing to negotiate for food, and the smaller \"killer mimic\" which is instinctively aggressive.<ref>Multiple authors. \"Creature Catalog III\" ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' No. 101 (TSR, 1985)</ref>\n\n''[[Dungeon (magazine)|Dungeon]]'' magazine No. 19 (October 1989) includes the adventure scenario \"The Vanishing Village\", by [[Marcus Rowland (author)|Marcus Rowland]], which features the ''house hunters''; these creatures are described in the adventure synopsis as \"gigantic relatives of mimics, able to imitate cottages and other buildings up to the size of a small inn or temple.\"\n\n===''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' 2nd edition===\nThe mimic first appeared for second edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' in the second volume of the ''[[Monstrous Compendium]]'' series (1989).  In this set, the creature is described as magically-created, and usually appears in the form of a treasure chest, although its natural color is a speckled grey that resembles granite. The entry notes that a mimic can alter its pigmentation to resemble varieties of stone (including marble), and various metals (including gold, silver, and copper); a mimic cannot lose mass in this transformation, but may radically alter its dimensions. This entry reveals the in-game origin of the mimic: \"Mimics were originally created by [[Wizard (Dungeons & Dragons)|wizards]] to protect themselves from treasure hunters\"; the language spoken by the smaller variety of mimic, also known as the '''common mimic''', is a corruption of the original language spoken by their wizard creators. Mimics have no moral code and are sometimes difficult to employ as guardians; the killer mimic is neutral in alignment like the common mimic, but has a tendency towards evil. The entry also notes that alcohol will weaken a mimic's glue, and that the mimic may neutralize the glue at any time; a mimic is also immune to acid attacks and is unaffected by molds, green slime, and various [[Black pudding (Dungeons & Dragons)|pudding monsters]].<ref>[[David Cook (game designer)|Cook, David \"Zeb\"]], [[Jon Pickens]], [[Steve Winter]], et al. ''[[Monstrous Compendium|Monstrous Compendium Volume Two]]'' (TSR, 1989)</ref> The mimic's entry is reprinted in the ''[[Monstrous Manual]]'' (1993).<ref>[[Doug Stewart (game designer)|Stewart, Doug]], ed. ''[[Monstrous Manual]]'' (TSR, 1993)</ref>\n\nThe '''space mimic''' appeared in the [[Spelljammer]] appendix for the ''Monstrous Compendium'' series (1990); the introduction credits [[Bruce Heard]] with the creature's design. These creatures inhabit the setting's \"wildspace\" between planetary bodies, and were created by wizards for use in long journeys, but proved unreliable servants and were discarded. A space mimic's natural skin is described as \"pitch black, with small specks of twinkling light, imitating a space background,\" and the creature is about the same size as a common mimic. A space mimic may pass as ship debris floating in wildspace, or as an elaborate desk with books and scrolls on an abandoned ship, and can resemble a piece of furniture of any variety of wood, stone, or metal. A space mimic has two eyes, which are normally hidden under thick eyelids. A space mimic also has the innate ability to cast spells as if it were an illusionist, and the creature has an interest in magic as well as food. The entry states that a space mimic will use its magic to become invisible and hypnotize a wizard, levitating itself to lure him somewhere alone, then steal his books, scrolls, and [[Magic item (Dungeons & Dragons)|magic items]] before eating the victim.<ref>[[Jeff Grubb|Grubb, Jeff]], et al. ''[[Monstrous Compendium|Monstrous Compendium Spelljammer Appendix]]'' (TSR, 1990)</ref>\n\nAnother mimic variant appears in the [[Forgotten Realms]] setting [[boxed set]], ''[[The Ruins of Undermountain II: The Deep Levels]]'' (1994), in the set's 16-page Monstrous Compendium booklet. Stated to be found only in the setting's [[Undermountain]] thus far, the '''greater mimic''' is vastly larger than a common mimic and can cover a whole room or a small building such as a tomb; the largest known specimen can cover a {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} cubic area. A greater mimic has a higher intelligence than a common mimic, and a limited resistance to magic, and \"can alter its coloring and shape to imitate a vast number of textures, colors, and shapes at once... [creating] entire rooms of furniture, treasure and tapestries.\" A greater mimic can block a corridor and alter its shape to become a room with entrance doors on either side, so that its prey walks directly into it; a greater mimic will always use enticements such as simulated treasure or furniture to lure prey, and will wait until an entire group enters before attacking. A greater mimic will then release its natural adhesive across all its surfaces and attack by slamming the walls of its structure together. A minority of greater mimics can develop an ability to display illusory creatures inside itself, pretending to speak through these creatures' mouths. This mutation of the common mimic, according to its entry in this boxed set, is presumed to be the result of either a mimic having lived for a century and grown to great size, or perhaps a mimic altered by the strange magic of Undermountain and the wizards that reside there. A greater mimic is unlikely to obey a wizard, although [[Halaster Blackcloak|Halaster]] is able to use these creatures as guards and barriers against adventurers. A greater mimic has limited mobility to due its size, and will usually settle in one place. A greater mimic makes pacts with other local creatures for food, but can sustain itself on little or no food for long periods of time if need be; a greater mimic has a prodigious appetite, however, and does not practice conservation if a steady supply of food is available. A greater mimic appears in this boxed set's ''Campaign Guide'' booklet, as part of the \"Muiral's Gauntlet\" scenario, living in an abandoned [[Drow (Dungeons & Dragons)|drow]] complex. When encountered by [[player character]]s, this greater mimic covers most of the floor in an apparent storeroom filled with boxes of coins and valuables; if it appears to be losing a fight against the characters, it will negotiate, trading information for its life.<ref>[[Jean Rabe|Rabe, Jean]], [[Norm Ritchie]], and [[Don Bingle|Donald Bingle]].

It is portrayed as being able to change its shape to disguise its body as an inanimate object, commonly a chest. The mimic has a powerful adhesive that holds fast to creatures that touch it, allowing the mimic to beat its victims with its powerful pseudopods. The mimic was introduced in the [[Advanced Dungeons & Dragons|first edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'']] game's original ''[[Monster Manual#1st Edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons|Monster Manual]]''. The mimic has appeared in subsequent editions. Several variants of the creature have been introduced, with a variety of abilities and sizes.\n\n==Publication history==\n===''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' 1st edition===\nThe mimic made its first appearance in the original ''[[Monster Manual#1st Edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons|Monster Manual]]'' (1977), by [[Gary Gygax]]. This book described mimics as \"subterranean creatures which cannot stand the light of the sun. They are able to perfectly mimic stone or wood.\" According to the book, mimics thus pose as items such as stonework, doors, or chests; when a character or creature touches the disguised mimic, the mimic can lash out with a bludgeoning pseudopod. A mimic excretes an adhesive glue to hold fast whatever touches it. The book states that all mimics move about constantly in search of prey. Mimics are described as [[Neutral (Dungeons & Dragons)|neutral]] in [[Alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)|alignment]].\n\nThe ''Monster Manual'' mentions that there are two types of mimic encountered in the game. The slightly smaller version is more intelligent, and is generally friendly if offered food, usually telling a [[player character]] about what it has seen nearby. These creatures have their own language and can usually speak several other tongues. The book described the larger variety of mimic as a carnivorous creature called a \"killer mimic\". This creature does not speak, and will attack anything which is nearby.<ref>[[Gary Gygax|Gygax, Gary]]. ''[[Monster Manual#1st Edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons|Monster Manual]]'' ([[TSR, Inc.|TSR]], 1979)</ref> The ''Monster Manual'' was reviewed by [[Don Turnbull (game designer)|Don Turnbull]] in the British magazine ''[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]'' No. 8 (August/September 1978). As part of his review, Turnbull comments on several new monsters introduced in the book, referring to the mimic as a thing which adventurers from his Greenlands dungeon \"are not going to be best placed to meet\".<ref name=\"WD8\">{{cite journal|title=Open Box|authorlink=Don Turnbull (game designer)|last=Turnbull|first=Don|journal=[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]|issue=8|date=August\u2013September 1978|pages=16\u201317}}</ref>\n\nThe July 1983 issue of ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' magazine (No. 75) featured the article \"The Ecology of the Mimic\", by [[Ed Greenwood]]. This article provides additional in-game descriptions of the mimic, with the information purported as having come from \"the Journals of Maerlun the Scholar\". The article states that a mimic's hide is naturally gray in hue, with a smooth very hard outer skin that appears stone-like; a mimic is able to change the color and texture of its outer surface to resemble wood-grain by shifting a brown pigmented liquid between its interior and exterior body cells to fill the many capillaries lying just beneath the skin surface, while the creature can empty these capillaries to revert to its normal stone-like appearance. A mimic is amorphous, able to alter the external configuration of its form at will, and the more intelligent ones can even assume the shape of a partition wall, overhanging arch, or rough rock wall; this feat is accomplished by the creature's mode of travel, which involves extending its strong pseudopods, which exude a sticky \"glue\", and pulling itself along (\"unsticking\" its own glue at will), traveling on walls and ceilings as easily as it can on floors. The article also describes how a mimic observes its surroundings through its very sensitive \"eyespots\" (patches of pigment that are sensitive to heat, light, and vibration) all over its skin; bright sunlight effectively blinds a mimic by overwhelming these sensory spots, which is why mimics are almost always found in areas where the sun never reaches.<ref>[[Ed Greenwood|Greenwood, Ed]]. \"The Ecology of the Mimic.\" ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' No. 75 (TSR, 1983)</ref> Austin Wood of [[PC Gamer]] described Greenwood's article as \"probably the closest thing to science to ever come out of D&D\".<ref name=\"PCGamer\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/the-murderous-history-of-mimics/|work=[[PC Gamer]]|title=The murderous history of mimics|last=Wood|first=Austin|date=3 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe monster collection \"Creature Catalog III\" in ''Dragon'' No. 101 (September 1985) featured a creature by contributor Gregory Detwiler known as the '''metal mimic'''. The entry states that a metal mimic is a more powerful relative of the \"ordinary\" mimic, with all of the mimic's basic abilities and characteristics, but being able to imitate metal, in addition to being able to imitate wood and stone. The metal mimic can take on the shape and appearance of items of any raw or finished metal, which includes the color, luster, and texture of any pure metal (such as iron, gold, silver, or platinum) except for adamantite, but cannot form into any alloy. A metal mimic can also create a magical illumination from itself or from any nearby object. A metal mimic can exude a pseudopod in the form of a sword or dagger; such extremities will appear to be a valuable enchanted blade, to lure prey. According to this entry, metal mimics come in two types: the larger, non-belligerent type which may be willing to negotiate for food, and the smaller \"killer mimic\" which is instinctively aggressive.<ref>Multiple authors. \"Creature Catalog III\" ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' No. 101 (TSR, 1985)</ref>\n\n''[[Dungeon (magazine)|Dungeon]]'' magazine No. 19 (October 1989) includes the adventure scenario \"The Vanishing Village\", by [[Marcus Rowland (author)|Marcus Rowland]], which features the ''house hunters''; these creatures are described in the adventure synopsis as \"gigantic relatives of mimics, able to imitate cottages and other buildings up to the size of a small inn or temple.\"\n\n===''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' 2nd edition===\nThe mimic first appeared for second edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' in the second volume of the ''[[Monstrous Compendium]]'' series (1989).  In this set, the creature is described as magically-created, and usually appears in the form of a treasure chest, although its natural color is a speckled grey that resembles granite. The entry notes that a mimic can alter its pigmentation to resemble varieties of stone (including marble), and various metals (including gold, silver, and copper); a mimic cannot lose mass in this transformation, but may radically alter its dimensions. This entry reveals the in-game origin of the mimic: \"Mimics were originally created by [[Wizard (Dungeons & Dragons)|wizards]] to protect themselves from treasure hunters\"; the language spoken by the smaller variety of mimic, also known as the '''common mimic''', is a corruption of the original language spoken by their wizard creators. Mimics have no moral code and are sometimes difficult to employ as guardians; the killer mimic is neutral in alignment like the common mimic, but has a tendency towards evil. The entry also notes that alcohol will weaken a mimic's glue, and that the mimic may neutralize the glue at any time; a mimic is also immune to acid attacks and is unaffected by molds, green slime, and various [[Black pudding (Dungeons & Dragons)|pudding monsters]].<ref>[[David Cook (game designer)|Cook, David \"Zeb\"]], [[Jon Pickens]], [[Steve Winter]], et al. ''[[Monstrous Compendium|Monstrous Compendium Volume Two]]'' (TSR, 1989)</ref> The mimic's entry is reprinted in the ''[[Monstrous Manual]]'' (1993).<ref>[[Doug Stewart (game designer)|Stewart, Doug]], ed. ''[[Monstrous Manual]]'' (TSR, 1993)</ref>\n\nThe '''space mimic''' appeared in the [[Spelljammer]] appendix for the ''Monstrous Compendium'' series (1990); the introduction credits [[Bruce Heard]] with the creature's design. These creatures inhabit the setting's \"wildspace\" between planetary bodies, and were created by wizards for use in long journeys, but proved unreliable servants and were discarded. A space mimic's natural skin is described as \"pitch black, with small specks of twinkling light, imitating a space background,\" and the creature is about the same size as a common mimic. A space mimic may pass as ship debris floating in wildspace, or as an elaborate desk with books and scrolls on an abandoned ship, and can resemble a piece of furniture of any variety of wood, stone, or metal. A space mimic has two eyes, which are normally hidden under thick eyelids. A space mimic also has the innate ability to cast spells as if it were an illusionist, and the creature has an interest in magic as well as food. The entry states that a space mimic will use its magic to become invisible and hypnotize a wizard, levitating itself to lure him somewhere alone, then steal his books, scrolls, and [[Magic item (Dungeons & Dragons)|magic items]] before eating the victim.<ref>[[Jeff Grubb|Grubb, Jeff]], et al. ''[[Monstrous Compendium|Monstrous Compendium Spelljammer Appendix]]'' (TSR, 1990)</ref>\n\nAnother mimic variant appears in the [[Forgotten Realms]] setting [[boxed set]], ''[[The Ruins of Undermountain II: The Deep Levels]]'' (1994), in the set's 16-page Monstrous Compendium booklet. Stated to be found only in the setting's [[Undermountain]] thus far, the '''greater mimic''' is vastly larger than a common mimic and can cover a whole room or a small building such as a tomb; the largest known specimen can cover a {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} cubic area. A greater mimic has a higher intelligence than a common mimic, and a limited resistance to magic, and \"can alter its coloring and shape to imitate a vast number of textures, colors, and shapes at once... [creating] entire rooms of furniture, treasure and tapestries.\" A greater mimic can block a corridor and alter its shape to become a room with entrance doors on either side, so that its prey walks directly into it; a greater mimic will always use enticements such as simulated treasure or furniture to lure prey, and will wait until an entire group enters before attacking. A greater mimic will then release its natural adhesive across all its surfaces and attack by slamming the walls of its structure together. A minority of greater mimics can develop an ability to display illusory creatures inside itself, pretending to speak through these creatures' mouths. This mutation of the common mimic, according to its entry in this boxed set, is presumed to be the result of either a mimic having lived for a century and grown to great size, or perhaps a mimic altered by the strange magic of Undermountain and the wizards that reside there. A greater mimic is unlikely to obey a wizard, although [[Halaster Blackcloak|Halaster]] is able to use these creatures as guards and barriers against adventurers. A greater mimic has limited mobility to due its size, and will usually settle in one place.

Simcha Bunim [[Torah study|studied Torah]] at ''[[yeshiva]]s'' in [[Mattersburg|Mattersdorf]] and [[Mikulov|Nikolsburg]]. He was introduced to ''[[hasidism]]'' by his father-in-law, and became a follower of [[Yisroel Hopstein]], and then [[Yaakov Yitzchak of Lublin]], and  [[Yaakov Yitzchak Rabinowicz]], the ''hasidic'' leaders of the day. After the death of the Rabinowicz, most ''hasidim'' made Bunim their ''[[rebbe]]''.\n\nNot wanting to take up a rabbinical position, Bunim supported himself by practicing [[pharmacy]].
