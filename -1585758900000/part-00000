''Pulpety'' or ''klopsy'' are usually made from seasoned ground meat with onion and mixed with eggs and either breadcrumbs or wheat rolls soaked in milk or water. Fried ''pulpety'' are larger than typical cooked ones. They can be round or flat in shape. The latter, in many countries, would be considered a cross between a meatball and a hamburger. The fried variety is called ''mielony'' (short for ''kotlet mielony'', literally \"minced cutlet\"), and its mass-produced version (as well as the one served in bars, etc.) is the subject of many jokes and urban legends about what is used to produce it.\n*In [[Portugal]], meatballs are called ''alm\u00f4ndegas'' {{IPA-pt|a\u026b\u02c8m\u00f5d\u0268\u0263\u0250\u0283|}}.

They are typically made with ground beef or a mixture of pork and beef and served with mashed potatoes, with tomato based sauce.\n*In [[Spain]] and [[Hispanic America]], meatballs are called ''alb\u00f3ndigas'', derived from the [[Arabic]] ''al-bunduq'' (meaning hazelnut, or, by extension, a small round object). ''Alb\u00f3ndigas'' are thought to have originated as a Berber or Arab dish imported to Spain during the period of [[Al-Andalus|Muslim rule]]. Spanish ''alb\u00f3ndigas'' can be served as an appetizer or main course, often in a tomato sauce.

The word ''kofta'' is derived from [[Persian language|Persian]] ''k\u016bfta'': In Persian, \u06a9\u0648\u0641\u062a\u0646 (kuftan) means \"to beat\" or \"to grind\" or ''meatball''.<ref>Alan S. Kaye, \"Persian loanwords in English\", ''English Today'' '''20''':20-24 (2004), {{DOI|10.1017/S0266078404004043}}.</ref> In the simplest form, koftas consist of balls or fingers of minced or [[ground meat]] \u2013 usually [[beef]] or [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] \u2013 mixed with spices and/or onions and other ingredients. The vegetarian variety is popular in India. They can be grilled, fried, steamed, poached, baked or marinated, and may be served with a rich spicy sauce.\n*In [[Afghanistan]], meatballs are used as a traditional dish with homemade soups or are made with a tomato-based sauce that may include some plum seeds to increase tartness and is served with bread or rice which is called ''Kofta-Chelou''. Nowadays meatballs are also grilled on top of [[pizza]].\n*[[Armenian cuisine|Armenian]] stewed meatballs/meatball and vegetable stew (''kufte rize'') is a classic dish often poured over rice for consumption.\n*In [[Iran]], several types of meatballs are consumed. If they are cooked in a stew, they are called ''kufteh.'' If they are fried (typically small meatballs), they are called ''kal-e gonjeshki'' (literally \"[[Old World sparrow|sparrow]]'s head\"). Both types are consumed with either bread or rice. Typically, herbs are added, and for ''kufteh'', usually the meatball is filled with hard boiled eggs or dried fruits. There are several (at least 10) types; the most famous is \"kufteh tabrizi\", traditionally from [[Tabriz]] in northwestern Iran.\n*In [[Israel]], meatballs are called ktzitzot basar ({{lang-he|\u05e7\u05e6\u05d9\u05e6\u05d5\u05ea \u05d1\u05e9\u05e8}}), or sometimes simply ktzitzot ({{lang-he|\u05e7\u05e6\u05d9\u05e6\u05d5\u05ea}}). Their exact ingredients and preparation vary widely, due to the influence of Jewish immigration from different regions. They are typically made of spiced ground beef, though turkey and chicken versions are also available, and in their common form, they are shaped as slightly flattened balls, pan fried and then cooked in tomato sauce or broth. Other variations also exist, including the [[Gondi (dumpling)|gondi]], which were brought by the [[Persian Jews]], the albondigas of the [[Sephardic cuisine]], and the kufta that is customary with some [[Mizrahi Jews]].\n*In [[Pakistan]] and [[India]], meatballs are called ''koftas''. Pakistani and Indian meatballs are normally cooked in a spicy curry and sometimes with whole pre-boiled eggs. In Pakistan they are cooked in a gravy called ''chorba.'' Sometimes the eggs are encased in a layer of the spicy kofta meat so that the final product resembles an Indian [[Scotch egg]]. These kofta dishes are very popular with Indian diaspora and are widely available from many Indian restaurants.\n*In [[Syria]], meatballs are prepared in numerous ways. They are grilled on charcoal with or without eggplants or cooked in a stew with potato, onion and tomato sauce with a side of rice which is called Dawood Pasha. \n*In [[West Bengal]] state of India and [[Bangladesh]], koftas are made with prawns, fish, green bananas, and cabbage, as well as minced goat meat.\n\n=== East and Southeast Asia ===\n[[File:Chinese meatballs 2.jpg|thumb|A variety of Chinese meatballs and [[fishball]]s]]\n*[[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]] meatballs (''wanzi'') are typically made of pork and can be steamed, boiled or deep fried, sometimes with the addition of [[soy sauce]]. Large meatballs, called [[lion's head (food)|lion's heads]], can range in size from about {{convert|5-10|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter. Smaller varieties, called [[pork ball]]s, are used in soups. A [[Cantonese cuisine|Cantonese]] variant, the [[steamed meatball]], is made of beef and served as a [[dim sum]] dish. Fish and seafood can also used to create different flavors and textures, and vegetarian alternatives to meatballs are served during festivals. In northern China, meatballs made from minced meat and flour, sometimes with the addition of [[lotus root]] or [[water chestnut]] for texture, are deep-fried and served in a [[vinegar]]-based sweet and sour sauce, or in a light broth with chopped [[coriander]].\n[[File:Bakso.jpg|thumb|Indonesian ''[[bakso]]'' noodle soup]]\n*[[Indonesia]]n meatballs are called ''[[bakso]]'' which are usually served in a bowl, served in broth soup, with noodles, rice vermicelli, bean curd (tofu), hard-boiled egg, ''siomay''/ steamed meat dumpling, and fried wonton. They have a consistent homogeneous texture. ''Bakso'' can be found in major Indonesian cities and towns, however, the most popular are ''bakso Solo'' and ''bakso Malang'' (named after the city of origin). In Malang, ''bakso bakar'' (roasted ''bakso'') is also popular. As most Indonesians are Muslim, generally it is made from beef or sometimes chicken.\n*In [[Japanese cuisine]], a popular variant of meatballs is ''[[tsukune]]'', minced chicken meatballs on a skewer. The [[Japan]]ese [[hamburger]] steak, ''hanb\u0101gu'', is typically made of ground beef, milk-soaked [[panko]] (bread crumbs) and minced, sauteed onions. They are typically eaten with a sauce made from ketchup and [[Worcestershire sauce]]. Chinese style meatballs are also popular.  Another kind of meatball called ''Tsumire'' is made from ground fish.  This is often added to soups or Nabes (stews).\n*In the [[Philippines]], meatballs are called ''bola-bola'' or ''[[almondigas]]'' and are usually served in a ''[[misua]]'' noodle soup with toasted garlic, squash and pork [[Pork rind|cracklings]]. ''Bola-bola'' are derived from Hispanic influence on Filipino cuisine and ultimately derived from Moorish influence. ''Bola-bola'' are also stewed or pan-fried until golden brown. ''Bola-bola'' is also used as a filling for [[siopao]], the local variant of ''[[baozi]]''.\n*In [[Vietnam]], meatballs (''th\u1ecbt vi\u00ean'' or ''m\u1ecdc'', ''b\u00f2 vi\u00ean'', ''c\u00e1 vi\u00ean'') can be used as an ingredient in ''[[ph\u1edf]]'' and ''[[h\u1ee7 ti\u1ebfu]]''. It is also common to cook meatballs in tomato sauce, and finely chopped spring onion and peppers are added before serving. In ''[[b\u00fan ch\u1ea3]]'' (a specialty Vietnamese rice noodle), meatballs are grilled to be ''ch\u1ea3'' and served with ''b\u00fan'' (rice noodles) and dipping sauce (based on fish sauce seasoned with rice vinegar, sugar, garlic, and chili).

If they are cooked in a stew, they are called ''kufteh.'' If they are fried (typically small meatballs), they are called ''kal-e gonjeshki'' (literally \"[[Old World sparrow|sparrow]]'s head\"). Both types are consumed with either bread or rice. Typically, herbs are added, and for ''kufteh'', usually the meatball is filled with hard boiled eggs or dried fruits.

Their exact ingredients and preparation vary widely, due to the influence of Jewish immigration from different regions. They are typically made of spiced ground beef, though turkey and chicken versions are also available, and in their common form, they are shaped as slightly flattened balls, pan fried and then cooked in tomato sauce or broth. Other variations also exist, including the [[Gondi (dumpling)|gondi]], which were brought by the [[Persian Jews]], the albondigas of the [[Sephardic cuisine]], and the kufta that is customary with some [[Mizrahi Jews]].\n*In [[Pakistan]] and [[India]], meatballs are called ''koftas''.

In northern China, meatballs made from minced meat and flour, sometimes with the addition of [[lotus root]] or [[water chestnut]] for texture, are deep-fried and served in a [[vinegar]]-based sweet and sour sauce, or in a light broth with chopped [[coriander]].\n[[File:Bakso.jpg|thumb|Indonesian ''[[bakso]]'' noodle soup]]\n*[[Indonesia]]n meatballs are called ''[[bakso]]'' which are usually served in a bowl, served in broth soup, with noodles, rice vermicelli, bean curd (tofu), hard-boiled egg, ''siomay''/ steamed meat dumpling, and fried wonton. They have a consistent homogeneous texture. ''Bakso'' can be found in major Indonesian cities and towns, however, the most popular are ''bakso Solo'' and ''bakso Malang'' (named after the city of origin). In Malang, ''bakso bakar'' (roasted ''bakso'') is also popular. As most Indonesians are Muslim, generally it is made from beef or sometimes chicken.\n*In [[Japanese cuisine]], a popular variant of meatballs is ''[[tsukune]]'', minced chicken meatballs on a skewer. The [[Japan]]ese [[hamburger]] steak, ''hanb\u0101gu'', is typically made of ground beef, milk-soaked [[panko]] (bread crumbs) and minced, sauteed onions. They are typically eaten with a sauce made from ketchup and [[Worcestershire sauce]]. Chinese style meatballs are also popular.  Another kind of meatball called ''Tsumire'' is made from ground fish.  This is often added to soups or Nabes (stews).\n*In the [[Philippines]], meatballs are called ''bola-bola'' or ''[[almondigas]]'' and are usually served in a ''[[misua]]'' noodle soup with toasted garlic, squash and pork [[Pork rind|cracklings]]. ''Bola-bola'' are derived from Hispanic influence on Filipino cuisine and ultimately derived from Moorish influence. ''Bola-bola'' are also stewed or pan-fried until golden brown. ''Bola-bola'' is also used as a filling for [[siopao]], the local variant of ''[[baozi]]''.\n*In [[Vietnam]], meatballs (''th\u1ecbt vi\u00ean'' or ''m\u1ecdc'', ''b\u00f2 vi\u00ean'', ''c\u00e1 vi\u00ean'') can be used as an ingredient in ''[[ph\u1edf]]'' and ''[[h\u1ee7 ti\u1ebfu]]''. It is also common to cook meatballs in tomato sauce, and finely chopped spring onion and peppers are added before serving. In ''[[b\u00fan ch\u1ea3]]'' (a specialty Vietnamese rice noodle), meatballs are grilled to be ''ch\u1ea3'' and served with ''b\u00fan'' (rice noodles) and dipping sauce (based on fish sauce seasoned with rice vinegar, sugar, garlic, and chili). ''X\u00edu M\u1ea1i'' is a pork meatball in a tomato sauce often served with a baguette.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"220px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:Seseri and Tsukune.jpg|Japanese ''Seseri'' (left) and {{Nihongo|[[Tsukune]]|\u3064\u304f\u306d}} (right)\nFile:Miswajf7582.JPG|''Bola-bola'' with [[misua]] from the [[Philippines]]\nFile:Bun Moc Ha Noi.jpg|A bowl of ''[[B\u00fan m\u1ecdc]]'' in [[Vietnam]], ''b\u00fan'' is rice vermicelli, while ''m\u1ecdc'' means pork-ball\nFile:Filipino bola-bola (meatballs).jpg|Fried ''bola-bola'' from the Philippines\n</gallery>\n\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Food}}\n* [[Frikandel]], a Belgian and Dutch snack, similar in texture to meatballs, but shaped more like a hot dog or sausage than a ball \n* [[List of meatball dishes]]\n* [[Rissole]]\n* [[Liberty Kitchen]], a British social enterprise with meatballs at its heart\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{Commons category inline|Meatballs}}\n*{{Wikibooks-inline|Cookbook:Meatballs}}\n{{Meat|state=expanded}}\n{{Lists of prepared foods}}\n\n[[Category:Meatballs| ]]\n[[Category:World cuisine]]\n[[Category:Meat dishes]]\n[[Category:Types of food]]\n[[Category:National dishes]]\n", "name_user": "Lampshade444", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eEurope:Added content)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meatball"}
