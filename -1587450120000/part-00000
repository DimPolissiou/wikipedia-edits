The story began with the reader finding out the main character, Paul, is suspended from high school. He meets with his principal and teachers who complain about Paul's \"defiant manner\" in class and the \"physical aversion\" he exhibits toward his teachers. One of Paul's teachers also mentions that Paul's mother died back when he was a child in Colorado; which is later shown to be of importance. Paul works as an usher for Carnegie Hall in Pittsburgh. His job is one of the only parts of his life he enjoys. He stays for the concert and enjoys the social scene while losing himself in the music. After the concert, Paul follows the soloist and imagines life inside her hotel room. Unfortunately, soon after the audience learns that Paul and his father have a poor relationship. Upon returning home very late one night, Paul enters through the basement window to avoid a confrontation with his father. Paul's relationship with his father is one of tension. While in the basement, Paul gets nervous that his father will come downstairs with a shotgun and kill him. Paul stays awake for the remainder of the night, imagining what would happen if his father mistook him for a burglar and shot him, or if his dad would recognize him in time. Not only does Paul wonder if his father will recognize him in time, but he also entertains the idea of his father possibly regretting not shooting him when he had the chance to do so.   \n\nPaul despises the people on Cordelia Street as they serve to remind him of his own lackluster life. Although his father considers him a role model for Paul, Paul is unimpressed by a plodding young man who works for an iron company and is married with four children. While Paul longs to be wealthy, cultivated, and powerful, He lacks the stamina and ambition to attempt to change his condition. Instead, Paul escapes his monotonous life by visiting Charley Edwards; a young actor. Later on, Paul makes it clear to one of his teachers that his job ushering is more important than his schoolwork, causing his father to prevent him from continuing to work as an usher.\n\nPaul takes a train to New York City after stealing money from his dad' s job. Paul buys an expensive wardrobe, rents a room at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]], and walks around the city. He also meets a young boy from [[San Francisco]] who takes him on an all-night tour of the city's lively social scene. His few days of impersonating a rich, privileged young man, brought him more contentment than he had ever known because living a prosperous life is Paul's only hope and dream.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://english.fju.edu.tw/lctd/asp/works/51/study.htm#03|title=Paul's Case|website=english.fju.edu.tw|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref> However, on the eighth day, after spending most of his money, Paul read from a Pittsburgh newspaper that his theft has been made public. His father has returned the money and is on his way to New York City to bring Paul back home to Pittsburgh. Paul then reveals that he had bought a gun on his first day in New York City, and briefly considers shooting himself to avoid returning to his old life in Pittsburgh. Eventually, he decides against it and instead commits suicide by jumping in front of a train. Paul made the ultimate decision of taking his own life because the thought of returning to his old lifestyle was too much for him to handle.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burke|first=Gerald T.|date=July 2003|title=The Willa Cather Electronic Archive2003395The Willa Cather Electronic Archive.

It's almost as if we as readers are as much in a fantasy world as Paul is himself.

When Paul has a meeting with his instructors and the principal, he puts on a smile. The narrator notes that other boys would be more afraid than Paul was and would most likely have given in to an emotional and remorseful response about their disruptive behaviors.

Paul tries to greet each customer and provide them with exceptional customer service. Besides, Paul loves watching the concerts and other social events that are happening at the Hall. Once Paul's father stopped him from working at the theater, Paul lost his sole outlet and place of comfort. Paul's connection to the theater developed because he acquired interest in the arts and it became a reliable place for him. The theater allowed him to develop creative skills that he did not gain at school. Being an usher at the theater helped Paul express himself and be around others who enjoyed the arts just like him. Paul was himself and he felt a level of sense of approval at the theater.

The story began with the reader finding out the main character, Paul, is suspended from high school. He meets with his principal and teachers who complain about Paul's \"defiant manner\" in class and the \"physical aversion\" he exhibits toward his teachers. One of Paul's teachers also mentions that Paul's mother died back when he was a child in Colorado; which is later shown to be of importance. Paul works as an usher for Carnegie Hall in Pittsburgh. His job is one of the only parts of his life he enjoys. He stays for the concert and enjoys the social scene while losing himself in the music. After the concert, Paul follows the soloist and imagines life inside her hotel room. Unfortunately, soon after the audience learns that Paul and his father have a poor relationship. Upon returning home very late one night, Paul enters through the basement window to avoid a confrontation with his father. Paul's relationship with his father is one of tension. While in the basement, Paul gets nervous that his father will come downstairs with a shotgun and kill him. Paul stays awake for the remainder of the night, imagining what would happen if his father mistook him for a burglar and shot him, or if his dad would recognize him in time. Not only does Paul wonder if his father will recognize him in time, but he also entertains the idea of his father possibly regretting not shooting him when he had the chance to do so.   \n\nPaul despises the people on Cordelia Street as they serve to remind him of his own lackluster life. Although his father considers him a role model for Paul, Paul is unimpressed by a plodding young man who works for an iron company and is married with four children. While Paul longs to be wealthy, cultivated, and powerful, He lacks the stamina and ambition to attempt to change his condition. Instead, Paul escapes his monotonous life by visiting Charley Edwards; a young actor. Later on, Paul makes it clear to one of his teachers that his job ushering is more important than his schoolwork, causing his father to prevent him from continuing to work as an usher.\n\nPaul takes a train to New York City after stealing money from his dad' s job. Paul buys an expensive wardrobe, rents a room at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]], and walks around the city. He also meets a young boy from [[San Francisco]] who takes him on an all-night tour of the city's lively social scene. His few days of impersonating a rich, privileged young man, brought him more contentment than he had ever known because living a prosperous life is Paul's only hope and dream.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://english.fju.edu.tw/lctd/asp/works/51/study.htm#03|title=Paul's Case|website=english.fju.edu.tw|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref> However, on the eighth day, after spending most of his money, Paul read from a Pittsburgh newspaper that his theft has been made public. His father has returned the money and is on his way to New York City to bring Paul back home to Pittsburgh. Paul then reveals that he had bought a gun on his first day in New York City, and briefly considers shooting himself to avoid returning to his old life in Pittsburgh. Eventually, he decides against it and instead commits suicide by jumping in front of a train. Paul made the ultimate decision of taking his own life because the thought of returning to his old lifestyle was too much for him to handle.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burke|first=Gerald T.|date=July 2003|title=The Willa Cather Electronic Archive2003395The Willa Cather Electronic Archive.

Once Paul's father stopped him from working at the theater, Paul lost his sole outlet and place of comfort. Paul's connection to the theater developed because he acquired interest in the arts and it became a reliable place for him. The theater allowed him to develop creative skills that he did not gain at school. Being an usher at the theater helped Paul express himself and be around others who enjoyed the arts just like him.

During his twenty-year career he appeared in thirty films and directed seven.\n\n==Biography==\nJoego was born in [[Makassar]] on the island of [[Sulawesi|Celebes]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]] on 17 March 1907. He and his parents moved to [[Singapore]], part of the British [[Straits Settlements]], where he was raised. Joego did not receive much education.{{sfn|Biran|1979|p=30}}\n\nIn the late 1920s Joego returned to the East Indies and became a member of the theatre troupe [[Dardanella (theatre company)|Dardanella]],{{sfn|Biran|1979|p=30}} which was run by the [[Penang]]-born actor of Russian descent Willy A. Piedro and his [[Native Indonesians|native]] wife Dewi Dja'.{{sfn|JCG, Dardanella}} Joego and the troupe, which included [[Andjar Asmara]] as the main script writer and actors such as Dja', [[Ratna Asmara]], and [[Astaman]], toured Southeast Asia. In 1936 it undertook a trip to India, hoping to produce a film version of Andjar's stage play ''Dr Samsi''. Under financial duress, this plan collapsed, and Dardanella disbanded;{{sfn|JCG, Dardanella}} Joego made his way back to the Indies and established his own theatrical troupe.{{sfn|Varia 1964, Riwajat Astaman}}\n\nJoego entered the film industry in 1940, when he and several former Dardanella members joined [[The Teng Chun]]'s Java Industrial Film (JIF) for the film ''[[Kartinah]]'', which was directed by Andjar Asmara and starred Ratna and Astaman.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=214}} Over the next two years Joego appeared in a further five films, all but one of which was for JIF or one of subsidiaries. His only appearance from the period in a non-JIF film was in ''[[Air Mata Iboe]]'' (1941), produced by the rival company Majestic. In the film, he depicted a man who becomes a robber and dies of guilt after his son is taken prisoner in his place.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Filmografi}}{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Air Mata Iboe}}\n\n[[File:Ali Yugo in Sri Asih Film Varia May 1954 p9.jpg|thumb|Joego (left) in ''Sri Asih'' (1954)]]\nDuring the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Japanese occupation]] of 1942\u201345, Joego led two stage troupes, Batu Tjinta and Nusantara.{{sfn|Biran|1979|p=30}} He returned to cinema in 1948 with ''[[Djaoeh Dimata]]'', in which he was cast alongside Ratna Asmara and portrayed a blind man who chases away his wife after fearing that she has been unfaithful.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Djaoeh Dimata}} Joego appeared in one further film for the production company, South Pacific Film, the Andjar Asmara-directed ''[[Gadis Desa]]'' (1949).{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Gadis Desa}}\n\nAs the 1950s dawned Joego became increasingly involved in the film industry, though mostly behind the screen. In 1951 he directed his first two films, ''Penganten Baru'' for Tan & Wong Bros. (a joint venture of the Tan and [[Wong brothers]]) and ''Marunda'' for Persari (under the direction of [[Djamaluddin Malik]]). The latter film depicted a love triangle set against the [[Indonesian National Revolution]].{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Penganten Baru}}{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Marunda}} Joego directed a further three films in three years, for various different companies.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Filmografi}}\n\nAlthough he ventured into filmmaking, Joego remained active as an actor. He appeared in six films between 1950 and 1954.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Filmografi}} In 1955, with the domestic cinema faltering, Joego ceased directing to focus on acting. He acted in a further ten films by the end of the decade. In 1963 Joego made his last film, ''Daerah Tak Bertuan''.{{sfn|Biran|1979|p=30}}{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Filmografi}} He died on 18 February 1970.{{sfn|Biran|1979|p=30}} Despite his twenty-year career he was&nbsp;\u2013 according to the magazine ''Mingguan Djaja''&nbsp;\u2013 never famous.{{sfn|Mingguan Djaja 1962}}\n\n==Filmography==\nAltogether Joego acted in 30 films.

Joego''' ([[Soewandi Spelling System|Soewandi Spelling]] '''Ali Jugo'''; [[EYD|Perfected Spelling]]: '''Ali Yugo''';  17 March 1907&nbsp;\u2013 18 February 1970) was a stage and film actor and director active in the [[Dutch East Indies]] and Indonesia. During his twenty-year career he appeared in thirty films and directed seven.\n\n==Biography==\nJoego was born in [[Makassar]] on the island of [[Sulawesi|Celebes]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]] on 17 March 1907. He and his parents moved to [[Singapore]], part of the British [[Straits Settlements]], where he was raised. Joego did not receive much education.{{sfn|Biran|1979|p=30}}\n\nIn the late 1920s Joego returned to the East Indies and became a member of the theatre troupe [[Dardanella (theatre company)|Dardanella]],{{sfn|Biran|1979|p=30}} which was run by the [[Penang]]-born actor of Russian descent Willy A. Piedro and his [[Native Indonesians|native]] wife Dewi Dja'.{{sfn|JCG, Dardanella}} Joego and the troupe, which included [[Andjar Asmara]] as the main script writer and actors such as Dja', [[Ratna Asmara]], and [[Astaman]], toured Southeast Asia. In 1936 it undertook a trip to India, hoping to produce a film version of Andjar's stage play ''Dr Samsi''. Under financial duress, this plan collapsed, and Dardanella disbanded;{{sfn|JCG, Dardanella}} Joego made his way back to the Indies and established his own theatrical troupe.{{sfn|Varia 1964, Riwajat Astaman}}\n\nJoego entered the film industry in 1940, when he and several former Dardanella members joined [[The Teng Chun]]'s Java Industrial Film (JIF) for the film ''[[Kartinah]]'', which was directed by Andjar Asmara and starred Ratna and Astaman.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=214}} Over the next two years Joego appeared in a further five films, all but one of which was for JIF or one of subsidiaries. His only appearance from the period in a non-JIF film was in ''[[Air Mata Iboe]]'' (1941), produced by the rival company Majestic. In the film, he depicted a man who becomes a robber and dies of guilt after his son is taken prisoner in his place.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Filmografi}}{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Air Mata Iboe}}\n\n[[File:Ali Yugo in Sri Asih Film Varia May 1954 p9.jpg|thumb|Joego (left) in ''Sri Asih'' (1954)]]\nDuring the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Japanese occupation]] of 1942\u201345, Joego led two stage troupes, Batu Tjinta and Nusantara.{{sfn|Biran|1979|p=30}} He returned to cinema in 1948 with ''[[Djaoeh Dimata]]'', in which he was cast alongside Ratna Asmara and portrayed a blind man who chases away his wife after fearing that she has been unfaithful.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Djaoeh Dimata}} Joego appeared in one further film for the production company, South Pacific Film, the Andjar Asmara-directed ''[[Gadis Desa]]'' (1949).{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Gadis Desa}}\n\nAs the 1950s dawned Joego became increasingly involved in the film industry, though mostly behind the screen. In 1951 he directed his first two films, ''Penganten Baru'' for Tan & Wong Bros. (a joint venture of the Tan and [[Wong brothers]]) and ''Marunda'' for Persari (under the direction of [[Djamaluddin Malik]]). The latter film depicted a love triangle set against the [[Indonesian National Revolution]].{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Penganten Baru}}{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Marunda}} Joego directed a further three films in three years, for various different companies.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Filmografi}}\n\nAlthough he ventured into filmmaking, Joego remained active as an actor. He appeared in six films between 1950 and 1954.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Filmografi}} In 1955, with the domestic cinema faltering, Joego ceased directing to focus on acting. He acted in a further ten films by the end of the decade. In 1963 Joego made his last film, ''Daerah Tak Bertuan''.{{sfn|Biran|1979|p=30}}{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Filmografi}} He died on 18 February 1970.{{sfn|Biran|1979|p=30}} Despite his twenty-year career he was&nbsp;\u2013 according to the magazine ''Mingguan Djaja''&nbsp;\u2013 never famous.{{sfn|Mingguan Djaja 1962}}\n\n==Filmography==\nAltogether Joego acted in 30 films.

[[Sunlight]] provides the [[energy]] that [[green plants]] use to create [[sugars]] mostly in the form of [[starch]]es, which release energy into the living things that digest them. This process of [[photosynthesis]] provides virtually all the energy used by living things. Historically, another important source of light for humans has been [[fire]], from ancient campfires to modern [[kerosene lamp]]s. With the development of [[electric light]]s and [[history of electric power transmission|power systems]], electric lighting has effectively replaced firelight. Some species of animals generate their own light, a process called [[bioluminescence]]. For example, [[fireflies]] use light to locate mates, and [[vampire squid]]s use it to hide themselves from prey.\n\nThe primary properties of visible light are [[intensity (physics)|intensity]], propagation direction, frequency or wavelength [[spectrum]], and [[polarization (waves)|polarization]], while its [[speed of light|speed in a vacuum]], 299,792,458 meters per second, is one of the fundamental [[Mathematical constant|constants]] of nature. Visible light, as with all types of electromagnetic radiation (EMR), is experimentally found to always move at this speed in a vacuum.<ref name=\"LeClerq\">{{Cite book |last=Uzan |first=J-P |last2=Leclercq |first2=B |year=2008 |journal=The Natural Laws of the Universe: Understanding Fundamental Constants |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dSAWX8TNpScC&pg=PA43 |pages=43\u20134 |isbn=978-0-387-73454-5|bibcode=2008nlu..book.....U |doi=10.1007/978-0-387-74081-2 |title=The Natural Laws of the Universe }}</ref>\n\nIn [[physics]], the term ''light'' sometimes refers to electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength, whether visible or not.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Camera lenses: from box camera to digital |author=Gregory Hallock Smith |publisher=SPIE Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8194-6093-6 |page=4 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6mb0C0cFCEYC&pg=PA4}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=Comprehensive Physics XII |author=Narinder Kumar |publisher=Laxmi Publications |year=2008 |isbn=978-81-7008-592-8 |page=1416 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=IryMtwHHngIC&pg=PA1416}}</ref> In this sense, [[gamma ray]]s, [[X-ray]]s, [[microwave]]s and [[radio wave]]s are also light. Like all types of EM radiation, visible light propagates as waves. However, the energy imparted by the waves is absorbed at single locations the way particles are absorbed. The absorbed energy of the EM waves is called a photon, and represents the [[quantum|quanta]] of light. When a wave of light is transformed and absorbed as a photon, the energy of the wave instantly collapses to a single location, and this location is where the photon \"arrives.\" This is what is called the [[wave function collapse]]. This dual wave-like and particle-like nature of light is known as the [[wave\u2013particle duality]]. The study of light, known as [[optics]], is an important research area in modern physics.\n\n==Electromagnetic spectrum and visible light==\n[[File:EM spectrum.svg|thumb|380px|The [[electromagnetic spectrum]], with the [[visible spectrum|visible portion]] highlighted]]\n{{Main|Electromagnetic spectrum}}\n\nGenerally, EM radiation (the designation \"radiation\" excludes static electric, magnetic, and [[near and far field|near fields]]), or EMR, is classified by wavelength into [[radio wave]]s, [[microwave]]s, [[infrared]], the [[visible spectrum]] that we perceive as light, [[ultraviolet]], [[X-ray]]s, and [[gamma ray]]s.\n\nThe behavior of EMR depends on its wavelength. Higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths, and lower frequencies have longer wavelengths.  When EMR interacts with single atoms and molecules, its behavior depends on the amount of energy per quantum it carries.\n\nEMR in the visible light region consists of [[quantum|quanta]] (called [[photon]]s) that are at the lower end of the energies that are capable of causing electronic excitation within molecules, which leads to changes in the bonding or chemistry of the molecule. At the lower end of the visible light spectrum, EMR becomes invisible to humans (infrared) because its photons no longer have enough individual energy to cause a lasting molecular change (a change in conformation) in the visual molecule [[retinal]] in the human retina, which change triggers the sensation of vision.\n\nThere exist animals that are sensitive to various types of infrared, but not by means of quantum-absorption. [[Infrared sensing in snakes]] depends on a kind of natural [[thermal imaging]], in which tiny packets of cellular water are raised in temperature by the infrared radiation. EMR in this range causes molecular vibration and heating effects, which is how these animals detect it.\n\nAbove the range of visible light, ultraviolet light becomes invisible to humans, mostly because it is absorbed by the cornea below 360 [[nanometer|nm]] and the internal lens below 400&nbsp;nm. Furthermore, the [[rod cell|rods]] and [[cone cell|cones]] located in the [[retina]] of the human eye cannot detect the very short (below 360&nbsp;nm) ultraviolet wavelengths and are in fact damaged by ultraviolet.

The fixed value of the speed of light in SI units results from the fact that the meter is now defined in terms of the speed of light. All forms of electromagnetic radiation move at exactly this same speed in vacuum.\n\nDifferent [[physicist]]s have attempted to measure the speed of light throughout history. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] attempted to measure the speed of light in the seventeenth century. An early experiment to measure the speed of light was conducted by [[Ole R\u00f8mer]], a Danish physicist, in 1676. Using a [[telescope]], R\u00f8mer observed the motions of [[Jupiter]] and one of its [[natural satellite|moons]], [[Io (moon)|Io]]. Noting discrepancies in the apparent period of Io's orbit, he calculated that light takes about 22 minutes to traverse the diameter of Earth's orbit.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS/Repository/1.0/Disseminate?view=body&id=pdf_1&handle=euclid.ss/1009212817 |title=Scientific Method, Statistical Method and the Speed of Light |journal=Statistical Science |year=2000 |volume=15 |pages=254\u2013278 |issue=3 |doi=10.1214/ss/1009212817 |mr=1847825|last1=Oldford |first1=R.

If R\u00f8mer had known the diameter of the Earth's orbit, he would have calculated a speed of 227,000,000&nbsp;m/s.\n\nAnother more accurate measurement of the speed of light was performed in Europe by [[Hippolyte Fizeau]] in 1849. Fizeau directed a beam of light at a mirror several kilometers away. A rotating [[cog wheel]] was placed in the path of the light beam as it traveled from the source, to the mirror and then returned to its origin.  Fizeau found that at a certain rate of rotation, the beam would pass through one gap in the wheel on the way out and the next gap on the way back. Knowing the distance to the mirror, the number of teeth on the wheel, and the rate of rotation, Fizeau was able to calculate the speed of light as 313,000,000&nbsp;m/s.\n\n[[L\u00e9on Foucault]] carried out an experiment which used rotating mirrors to obtain a value of 298,000,000&nbsp;m/s in 1862. [[Albert A. Michelson]] conducted experiments on the speed of light from 1877 until his death in 1931. He refined Foucault's methods in 1926 using improved rotating mirrors to measure the time it took light to make a round trip from [[Mount Wilson (California)|Mount Wilson]] to [[Mount San Antonio]] in California. The precise measurements yielded a speed of 299,796,000&nbsp;m/s.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Michelson |first=A.A. |title=Measurements of the velocity of light between Mount Wilson and Mount San Antonio |journal=Astrophysical Journal |date=January 1927 |volume=65 |pages=1 |doi=10.1086/143021 |bibcode=1927ApJ....65....1M}}</ref>\n\nThe effective velocity of light in various transparent substances containing ordinary [[matter]], is less than in vacuum. For example, the speed of light in water is about 3/4 of that in vacuum.\n\nTwo independent teams of physicists were said to bring light to a \"complete standstill\" by passing it through a [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate]] of the element [[rubidium]], one team at [[Harvard University]] and the [[Rowland Institute for Science]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the other at the [[Harvard\u2013Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]], also in Cambridge.<ref>{{cite web |author=Harvard News Office |url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2001/01.24/01-stoplight.html |title=Harvard Gazette: Researchers now able to stop, restart light |publisher=News.harvard.edu |date=24 January 2001 |accessdate=8 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028041346/http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2001/01.24/01-stoplight.html |archivedate=28 October 2011 }}</ref> However, the popular description of light being \"stopped\" in these experiments refers only to light being stored in the excited states of atoms, then re-emitted at an arbitrary later time, as stimulated by a second laser pulse. During the time it had \"stopped\" it had ceased to be light.\n\n==Optics==\n{{Main|Optics}}\n\nThe study of light and the interaction of light and [[matter]] is termed [[optics]]. The observation and study of [[optical phenomena]] such as [[rainbow]]s and the [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora borealis]] offer many clues as to the nature of light.\n\n===Refraction===\n{{Main|Refraction}}\n[[File:Refraction-with-soda-straw.jpg|thumb|250 px|An example of refraction of light. The straw appears bent, because of refraction of light as it enters liquid (the water, in this case) from air.]]\n[[File:Cloud in the sunlight.jpg|thumb|250px|A cloud illuminated by sunlight]]\n\nRefraction is the bending of light rays when passing through a surface between one transparent material and another. It is described by [[Snell's Law]]:\n\n:<math>n_1\\sin\\theta_1 = n_2\\sin\\theta_2\\ .</math>\n\nwhere \u03b8<sub>1</sub> is the angle between the ray and the surface [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] in the first medium, \u03b8<sub>2</sub> is the angle between the ray and the surface normal in the second medium, and n<sub>1</sub> and n<sub>2</sub> are the [[Index of refraction|indices of refraction]], ''n'' = 1 in a [[vacuum]] and ''n'' > 1 in a [[Transparency and translucency|transparent]] [[Chemical substance|substance]].\n\nWhen a beam of light crosses the boundary between a vacuum and another medium, or between two different media, the wavelength of the light changes, but the frequency remains constant. If the beam of light is not [[orthogonality|orthogonal]] (or rather normal) to the boundary, the change in wavelength results in a change in the direction of the beam. This change of direction is known as [[refraction]].\n\nThe refractive quality of [[lens (optics)|lenses]] is frequently used to manipulate light in order to change the apparent size of images. [[Magnifying glass]]es, [[Glasses|spectacles]], [[contact lens]]es, [[microscope]]s and [[refracting telescope]]s are all examples of this manipulation.\n\n==Light sources== <!-- This section is linked from [[Source]] -->\n{{Redirect|Lightsource|the solar energy developer named Lightsource|Lightsource Renewable Energy}}\n{{Further|List of light sources}}\nThere are many sources of light. A body at a given temperature emits a characteristic spectrum of [[black-body]] radiation. A simple thermal source is sunlight, the radiation emitted by the [[chromosphere]] of the [[Sun]] at around  {{convert|6000|K|C F|abbr=off}} peaks in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum when plotted in wavelength units<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thulescientific.com/LYNCH%20&%20Soffer%20OPN%201999.pdf |title=Spectrum and the Color Sensitivity of the Eye |website=Thulescientific.com |accessdate=29 August 2017}}</ref> and roughly 44% of sunlight energy that reaches the ground is visible.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/spectra/am1.5/ |title=Reference Solar Spectral Irradiance: Air Mass 1.5 |accessdate=12 November 2009}}</ref> Another example is [[incandescent light bulb]]s, which emit only around 10% of their energy as visible light and the remainder as infrared. A common thermal light source in history is the glowing solid particles in [[fire|flames]], but these also emit most of their radiation in the infrared, and only a fraction in the visible spectrum.\n\nThe peak of the black-body spectrum is in the deep infrared, at about 10 [[micrometre]] wavelength, for relatively cool objects like human beings. As the temperature increases, the peak shifts to shorter wavelengths, producing first a red glow, then a white one, and finally a blue-white color as the peak moves out of the visible part of the spectrum and into the ultraviolet. These colors can be seen when metal is heated to \"red hot\" or \"white hot\". Blue-white [[thermal emission]] is not often seen, except in stars (the commonly seen pure-blue color in a [[natural gas|gas]] flame or a [[welder]]'s torch is in fact due to molecular emission, notably by CH radicals (emitting a wavelength band around 425&nbsp;nm, and is not seen in stars or pure thermal radiation).\n\nAtoms emit and absorb light at characteristic energies. This produces \"[[emission line]]s\" in the spectrum of each atom. [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|Emission]] can be [[spontaneous emission|spontaneous]], as in [[light-emitting diode]]s, [[gas discharge]] lamps (such as [[neon lamp]]s and [[neon sign]]s, [[mercury-vapor lamp]]s, etc.), and flames (light from the hot gas itself\u2014so, for example, [[sodium]] in a gas flame emits characteristic yellow light). Emission can also be [[stimulated emission|stimulated]], as in a [[laser]] or a microwave [[maser]].\n\nDeceleration of a free charged particle, such as an [[electron]], can produce visible radiation: [[cyclotron radiation]], [[synchrotron radiation]], and [[bremsstrahlung]] radiation are all examples of this. Particles moving through a medium faster than the speed of light in that medium can produce visible [[Cherenkov radiation]]. Certain chemicals produce visible radiation by [[chemoluminescence]]. In living things, this process is called [[bioluminescence]]. For example, [[firefly|fireflies]] produce light by this means, and boats moving through water can disturb plankton which produce a glowing wake.\n\nCertain substances produce light when they are illuminated by more energetic radiation, a process known as [[fluorescence]]. Some substances emit light slowly after excitation by more energetic radiation. This is known as [[phosphorescence]]. Phosphorescent materials can also be excited by bombarding them with subatomic particles. [[Cathodoluminescence]] is one example. This mechanism is used in [[cathode ray tube]] [[television set]]s and [[computer monitor]]s.\n\n[[File:Colorful artificial lighting at night.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Hong Kong]] illuminated by colorful artificial [[lighting]].]]\n\nCertain other mechanisms can produce light:\n* [[Bioluminescence]]\n* [[Cherenkov radiation]]\n* [[Electroluminescence]]\n* [[Scintillation (physics)|Scintillation]]\n* [[Sonoluminescence]]\n* [[Triboluminescence]]\n\nWhen the concept of light is intended to include very-high-energy photons (gamma rays), additional generation mechanisms include:\n* Particle\u2013[[antiparticle]] annihilation\n* [[Radioactive decay]]\n\n==Units and measures==\n{{Main|Photometry (optics)|Radiometry}}\n\nLight is measured with two main alternative sets of units: [[radiometry]] consists of measurements of light power at all wavelengths, while [[photometry (optics)|photometry]] measures light with wavelength weighted with respect to a standardized model of human brightness perception.  Photometry is useful, for example, to quantify [[Illumination (lighting)]] intended for human use.  The SI units for both systems are summarized in the following tables.\n\n{{SI radiometry units|1|self|nb}}<!-- parameter 1 for table number, parameter 2 for compare destination page, parameter 3 for reference group -->\n{{SI light units|2|self|nb}}<!-- parameter 1 for table number, parameter 2 for compare destination page, parameter 3 for reference group -->\n\nThe photometry units are different from most systems of physical units in that they take into account how the human eye responds to light. The [[cone cell]]s in the human eye are of three types which respond differently across the visible spectrum, and the cumulative response peaks at a wavelength of around 555&nbsp;nm. Therefore, two sources of light which produce the same intensity (W/m<sup>2</sup>) of visible light do not necessarily appear equally bright. The photometry units are designed to take this into account, and therefore are a better representation of how \"bright\" a light appears to be than raw intensity. They relate to raw [[power (physics)|power]] by a quantity called [[luminous efficacy]], and are used for purposes like determining how to best achieve sufficient illumination for various tasks in indoor and outdoor settings. The illumination measured by a [[photocell]] sensor does not necessarily correspond to what is perceived by the human eye, and without filters which may be costly, photocells and [[charge-coupled device]]s (CCD) tend to respond to some [[infrared]], [[ultraviolet]] or both.\n\n==Light pressure==\n{{Main|Radiation pressure}}\nLight exerts physical pressure on objects in its path, a phenomenon which can be deduced by Maxwell's equations, but can be more easily explained by the particle nature of light: photons strike and transfer their momentum. Light pressure is equal to the power of the light beam divided by ''[[speed of light|c]]'', the speed of light.{{Spaces}} Due to the magnitude of ''c'', the effect of light pressure is negligible for everyday objects.{{Spaces}} For example, a one-milliwatt [[laser pointer]] exerts a force of about 3.3 [[newton (unit)|piconewtons]] on the object being illuminated; thus, one could lift a [[penny (United States coin)|U.S. penny]] with laser pointers, but doing so would require about 30 billion 1-mW laser pointers.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Tang |first=Hong |title=May The Force of Light Be With You |journal=IEEE Spectrum |date=1 October 2009 |volume=46 |issue=10 |pages=46\u201351 |doi=10.1109/MSPEC.2009.5268000}}</ref>{{Spaces}} However, in [[nanometre]]-scale applications such as [[nanoelectromechanical systems]] (|NEMS), the effect of light pressure is more significant, and exploiting light pressure to drive NEMS mechanisms and to flip nanometre-scale physical switches in integrated circuits is an active area of research.<ref>See, for example, [http://www.eng.yale.edu/tanglab/research.htm nano-opto-mechanical systems research at Yale University].</ref> At larger scales, light pressure can cause [[asteroid]]s to spin faster,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2004/feb/asteroids-get-spun-by-the-sun/ |title=Asteroids Get Spun By the Sun |author=Kathy A. |website=Discover Magazine |date=5 February 2004}}</ref> acting on their irregular shapes as on the vanes of a [[windmill]].{{Spaces}} The possibility of making [[solar sail]]s that would accelerate spaceships in space is also under investigation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/roboticexplorers/solar_sails.html |title=Solar Sails Could Send Spacecraft 'Sailing' Through Space |website=NASA |date=31 August 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/news/releases/2004/04-208.html |title=NASA team successfully deploys two solar sail systems |website=NASA |date=9 August 2004}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the motion of the [[Crookes radiometer]] was originally attributed to light pressure, this interpretation is incorrect; the characteristic Crookes rotation is the result of a partial vacuum.<ref>P.

He wrote, \"radiation will exert pressure on both sides of the plate. The forces of pressure exerted on the two sides are equal if the plate is at rest. However, if it is in motion, more radiation will be reflected on the surface that is ahead during the motion (front surface) than on the back surface. The backwardacting force of pressure exerted on the front surface is thus larger than the force of pressure acting on the back. Hence, as the resultant of the two forces, there remains a force that counteracts the motion of the plate and that increases with the velocity of the plate. We will call this resultant 'radiation friction' in brief.\"\n\nUsually light momentum is aligned with its direction of motion.

[[Isaac Newton]] studied Gassendi's work at an early age, and preferred his view to Descartes' theory of the ''plenum''. He stated in his ''Hypothesis of Light'' of 1675 that light was composed of [[Corpuscularianism|corpuscles]] (particles of matter) which were emitted in all directions from a source. One of Newton's arguments against the wave nature of light was that waves were known to bend around obstacles, while light travelled only in straight lines. He did, however, explain the phenomenon of the [[diffraction]] of light (which had been observed by [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi|Francesco Grimaldi]]) by allowing that a light particle could create a localised wave in the [[Aether (classical element)|aether]].\n\nNewton's theory could be used to predict the [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] of light, but could only explain [[refraction]] by incorrectly assuming that light accelerated upon entering a denser [[Medium (optics)|medium]] because the [[gravity|gravitational]] pull was greater. Newton published the final version of his theory in his ''[[Opticks]]'' of 1704. His reputation helped the [[particle theory of light]] to hold sway during the 18th century. The particle theory of light led [[Laplace]] to argue that a body could be so massive that light could not escape from it. In other words, it would become what is now called a [[black hole]]. Laplace withdrew his suggestion later, after a wave theory of light became firmly established as the model for light (as has been explained, neither a particle or wave theory is fully correct). A translation of Newton's essay on light appears in ''The large scale structure of space-time'', by [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[George F. R. Ellis]].\n\nThe fact that light could be [[polarized light|polarized]] was for the first time qualitatively explained by Newton using the particle theory. [[\u00c9tienne-Louis Malus]] in 1810 created a mathematical particle theory of polarization. [[Jean-Baptiste Biot]] in 1812 showed that this theory explained all known phenomena of light polarization. At that time the polarization was considered as the proof of the particle theory.\n\n=== Wave theory ===\nTo explain the origin of [[color]]s, [[Robert Hooke]] (1635\u20131703) developed a \"pulse theory\" and compared the spreading of light to that of waves in water in his 1665 work ''[[Micrographia]]'' (\"Observation IX\"). In 1672 Hooke suggested that light's vibrations could be [[perpendicular]] to the direction of propagation. [[Christiaan Huygens]] (1629\u20131695) worked out a mathematical wave theory of light in 1678, and published it in his ''[[Treatise on light]]'' in 1690. He proposed that light was emitted in all directions as a series of waves in a medium called the ''[[Luminiferous ether]]''.  As waves are not affected by gravity, it was assumed that they slowed down upon entering a denser medium.<ref>Fokko Jan Dijksterhuis, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cPFevyomPUIC Lenses and Waves: Christiaan Huygens and the Mathematical Science of Optics in the 17th Century], Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2004, {{ISBN|1-4020-2697-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Christiaan Huygens-painting.jpeg|thumb|200 px|[[Christiaan Huygens]].]]\n\n[[File:Young Diffraction.png|right|thumb|200px|[[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]]'s sketch of a [[double-slit experiment]] showing [[diffraction]]. Young's experiments supported the theory that light consists of waves.]]\n\nThe wave theory predicted that light waves could interfere with each other like sound waves (as noted around 1800 by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]]). Young showed by means of a [[double-slit experiment|diffraction experiment]] that light behaved as waves. He also proposed that different [[color]]s were caused by different [[wavelength]]s of light, and explained color vision in terms of three-colored receptors in the eye. Another supporter of the wave theory was [[Leonhard Euler]]. He argued in ''Nova theoria lucis et colorum'' (1746) that [[diffraction]] could more easily be explained by a wave theory. In 1816 [[Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re]] gave [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] an idea that the polarization of light can be explained by the wave theory if light were a [[transverse wave]].<ref>James R. Hofmann, ''Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re: Enlightenment and Electrodynamics'', Cambridge University Press, 1996, p. 222.</ref>\n\nLater, Fresnel independently worked out his own wave theory of light, and presented it to the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences]] in 1817. [[Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson]] added to Fresnel's mathematical work to produce a convincing argument in favor of the wave theory, helping to overturn Newton's corpuscular theory.{{dubious|date=June 2018}}<!-- [[Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson]] says he was an opponent of the theory --> By the year 1821, Fresnel was able to show via mathematical methods that polarization could be explained by the wave theory of light if and only if light was entirely transverse, with no longitudinal vibration whatsoever.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nThe weakness of the wave theory was that light waves, like sound waves, would need a medium for transmission. The existence of the hypothetical substance ''luminiferous aether'' proposed by Huygens in 1678 was cast into strong doubt in the late nineteenth century by the [[Michelson\u2013Morley experiment]].\n\nNewton's corpuscular theory implied that light would travel faster in a denser medium, while the wave theory of Huygens and others implied the opposite. At that time, the [[speed of light]] could not be measured accurately enough to decide which theory was correct. The first to make a sufficiently accurate measurement was [[L\u00e9on Foucault]], in 1850.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Understanding Physics |author1=David Cassidy |author2=Gerald Holton |author3=James Rutherford |publisher=Birkh\u00e4user |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-387-98756-9 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=rpQo7f9F1xUC&pg=PA382}}</ref> His result supported the wave theory, and the classical particle theory was finally abandoned, only to partly re-emerge in the 20th century.\n\n===Electromagnetic theory===\n{{Main|Electromagnetic radiation}}\n[[File:light-wave.svg|360px|thumb|A 3\u2013dimensional rendering of [[Polarization (waves)|linearly polarized]] light wave frozen in time and showing the two oscillating components of light; an [[electric field]] and a [[magnetic field]] perpendicular to each other and to the direction of motion (a [[transverse wave]]).]]\n\nIn 1845, [[Michael Faraday]] discovered that the plane of polarization of linearly polarized light is rotated when the light rays travel along the [[magnetic field]] direction in the presence of a transparent [[dielectric]], an effect now known as [[Faraday rotation]].<ref name=\"LongairMalcolm\">{{cite book |last=Longair |first=Malcolm |title=Theoretical Concepts in Physics |year=2003 |page=87}}</ref> This was the first evidence that light was related to [[electromagnetism]].

Maxwell discovered that self-propagating electromagnetic waves would travel through space at a constant speed, which happened to be equal to the previously measured speed of light. From this, Maxwell concluded that light was a form of electromagnetic radiation: he first stated this result in 1862 in ''On Physical Lines of Force''. In 1873, he published ''[[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]]'', which contained a full mathematical description of the behavior of electric and magnetic fields, still known as [[Maxwell's equations]]. Soon after, [[Heinrich Hertz]] confirmed Maxwell's theory experimentally by generating and detecting radio waves in the laboratory, and demonstrating that these waves behaved exactly like visible light, exhibiting properties such as reflection, refraction, diffraction, and interference. Maxwell's theory and Hertz's experiments led directly to the development of modern radio, radar, television, electromagnetic imaging, and wireless communications.\n\nIn the quantum theory, photons are seen as [[wave packet]]s of the waves described in the classical theory of Maxwell. The quantum theory was needed to explain effects even with visual light that Maxwell's classical theory could not (such as [[spectral line]]s).\n\n===Quantum theory===\nIn 1900 [[Max Planck]], attempting to explain [[black-body radiation]] suggested that although light was a wave, these waves could gain or lose energy only in finite amounts related to their frequency. Planck called these \"lumps\" of light energy \"[[quantum|quanta]]\" (from a Latin word for \"how much\"). In 1905, Albert Einstein used the idea of light quanta to explain the [[photoelectric effect]], and suggested that these light quanta had a \"real\" existence. In 1923 [[Arthur Holly Compton]] showed that the wavelength shift seen when low intensity X-rays scattered from electrons (so called [[Compton scattering]]) could be explained by a particle-theory of X-rays, but not a wave theory. In 1926 [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] named these light quanta particles [[photon]]s.<ref>{{Open access}} {{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/IntroductionToMolecularSpectroscopy |title=Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy |last=Barrow |first=Gordon M. |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1962 |format=Scanned PDF |lccn=62-12478}}</ref>\n\nEventually the modern theory of [[quantum mechanics]] came to picture light as (in some sense) ''both'' a particle and a wave, and (in another sense), as a phenomenon which is ''neither'' a particle nor a wave (which actually are macroscopic phenomena, such as baseballs or ocean waves). Instead, modern physics sees light as something that can be described sometimes with mathematics appropriate to one type of macroscopic metaphor (particles), and sometimes another macroscopic metaphor (water waves), but is actually something that cannot be fully imagined. As in the case for radio waves and the X-rays involved in Compton scattering, physicists have noted that electromagnetic radiation tends to behave more like a classical wave at lower frequencies, but more like a classical particle at higher frequencies, but never completely loses all qualities of one or the other. Visible light, which occupies a middle ground in frequency, can easily be shown in experiments to be describable using either a wave or particle model, or sometimes both.\n\nIn February 2018, scientists reported, for the first time, the discovery of a new form of light, which may involve [[polariton]]s, that could be useful in the development of [[quantum computer]]s.<ref name=\"NW-20180216\">{{cite web |last=Hignett |first=Katherine |title=Physics Creates New Form of Light That Could Drive The Quantum Computing Revolution |url=http://www.newsweek.com/photons-light-physics-808862 |date=16 February 2018 |website=Newsweek |accessdate=17 February 2018 }}</ref><ref name=\"SCI-20180216\">{{cite journal |author=Liang, Qi-Yu|display-authors=etal|title=Observation of three-photon bound states in a quantum nonlinear medium |date=16 February 2018 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=359 |issue=6377 |pages=783\u2013786 |doi=10.1126/science.aao7293 |pmid=29449489 |pmc=6467536|arxiv=1709.01478 |bibcode=2018Sci...359..783L }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Physics|Science}}\n{{div col|colwidth=13em}}\n* [[Automotive lighting]]\n* [[Ballistic photon]]\n* [[Black-body radiation]]\n* [[Color temperature]]\n* [[Fermat's principle]]\n* [[Huygens' principle]]\n* [[Incandescent light bulb]]\n* [[International Commission on Illumination]]\n* ''[[Journal of Luminescence]]''\n* [[Light art]]\n* [[Light beam]] \u2013 in particular about light beams visible from the side\n* [[Light Fantastic (TV series)]]\n* [[Light mill]]\n* [[Light painting]]\n* [[Light pollution]]\n* [[Light therapy]]\n* [[Lighting]]\n* [[List of light sources]]\n* ''[[Luminescence: The Journal of Biological and Chemical Luminescence]]''\n* [[Photic sneeze reflex]]\n* [[Photometry (optics)|Photometry]]\n* [[Photon]]\n* [[Right to light]]\n* [[Risks and benefits of sun exposure]]\n* [[Spectroscopy]]\n* [[Visible spectrum]]\n* [[Wave\u2013particle duality]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=nb}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Commons-inline|Light}}\n* {{Wiktionary-inline}}\n* {{Wikiquote-inline}}\n* {{Britannica|340440|Light (physics)}}\n* {{LEDV|27859}}\n{{Radiation}}\n{{Color topics}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2019}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Light| ]]\n[[Category:Radiation]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Electromagnetic radiation in or near visible spectrum}}\n{{Redirect|Visible light|light that cannot be seen with human eye|Electromagnetic radiation|other uses|Light (disambiguation)|and|Visible light (disambiguation)}}\n{{Pp|small=yes}}\n{{pp-move-indef}}\n[[File:Light dispersion conceptual waves.gif|thumb|upright=1.2|A triangular [[dispersive prism|prism]] [[dispersion (optics)|dispersing]] a beam of white light.

[[Sunlight]] provides the [[energy]] that [[green plants]] use to create [[sugars]] mostly in the form of [[starch]]es, which release energy into the living things that digest them. This process of [[photosynthesis]] provides virtually all the energy used by living things. Historically, another important source of light for humans has been [[fire]], from ancient campfires to modern [[kerosene lamp]]s. With the development of [[electric light]]s and [[history of electric power transmission|power systems]], electric lighting has effectively replaced firelight. Some species of animals generate their own light, a process called [[bioluminescence]]. For example, [[fireflies]] use light to locate mates, and [[vampire squid]]s use it to hide themselves from prey.\n\nThe primary properties of visible light are [[intensity (physics)|intensity]], propagation direction, frequency or wavelength [[spectrum]], and [[polarization (waves)|polarization]], while its [[speed of light|speed in a vacuum]], 299,792,458 meters per second, is one of the fundamental [[Mathematical constant|constants]] of nature.

Like all types of EM radiation, visible light propagates as waves. However, the energy imparted by the waves is absorbed at single locations the way particles are absorbed. The absorbed energy of the EM waves is called a photon, and represents the [[quantum|quanta]] of light. When a wave of light is transformed and absorbed as a photon, the energy of the wave instantly collapses to a single location, and this location is where the photon \"arrives.\" This is what is called the [[wave function collapse]]. This dual wave-like and particle-like nature of light is known as the [[wave\u2013particle duality]]. The study of light, known as [[optics]], is an important research area in modern physics.\n\n==Electromagnetic spectrum and visible light==\n[[File:EM spectrum.svg|thumb|380px|The [[electromagnetic spectrum]], with the [[visible spectrum|visible portion]] highlighted]]\n{{Main|Electromagnetic spectrum}}\n\nGenerally, EM radiation (the designation \"radiation\" excludes static electric, magnetic, and [[near and far field|near fields]]), or EMR, is classified by wavelength into [[radio wave]]s, [[microwave]]s, [[infrared]], the [[visible spectrum]] that we perceive as light, [[ultraviolet]], [[X-ray]]s, and [[gamma ray]]s.\n\nThe behavior of EMR depends on its wavelength. Higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths, and lower frequencies have longer wavelengths.  When EMR interacts with single atoms and molecules, its behavior depends on the amount of energy per quantum it carries.\n\nEMR in the visible light region consists of [[quantum|quanta]] (called [[photon]]s) that are at the lower end of the energies that are capable of causing electronic excitation within molecules, which leads to changes in the bonding or chemistry of the molecule. At the lower end of the visible light spectrum, EMR becomes invisible to humans (infrared) because its photons no longer have enough individual energy to cause a lasting molecular change (a change in conformation) in the visual molecule [[retinal]] in the human retina, which change triggers the sensation of vision.\n\nThere exist animals that are sensitive to various types of infrared, but not by means of quantum-absorption. [[Infrared sensing in snakes]] depends on a kind of natural [[thermal imaging]], in which tiny packets of cellular water are raised in temperature by the infrared radiation. EMR in this range causes molecular vibration and heating effects, which is how these animals detect it.\n\nAbove the range of visible light, ultraviolet light becomes invisible to humans, mostly because it is absorbed by the cornea below 360 [[nanometer|nm]] and the internal lens below 400&nbsp;nm. Furthermore, the [[rod cell|rods]] and [[cone cell|cones]] located in the [[retina]] of the human eye cannot detect the very short (below 360&nbsp;nm) ultraviolet wavelengths and are in fact damaged by ultraviolet. Many animals with eyes that do not require lenses (such as insects and shrimp) are able to detect ultraviolet, by quantum photon-absorption mechanisms, in much the same chemical way that humans detect visible light.\n\nVarious sources define visible light as narrowly as 420\u2013680&nbsp;nm<ref>{{cite book |last=Laufer |first=Gabriel |title=Introduction to Optics and Lasers in Engineering |journal=Introduction to Optics and Lasers in Engineering |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4MxLPYMS5TUC&pg=PA11 |accessdate=20 October 2013 |date=13 July 1996 |isbn=978-0-521-45233-5 |page=11|bibcode=1996iole.book.....L }}</ref><ref name=\"Bradt2004\">{{cite book |last=Bradt |first=Hale |title=Astronomy Methods: A Physical Approach to Astronomical Observations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hp7vyaGvhLMC&pg=PA26 |accessdate=20 October 2013 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-53551-9 |page=26}}</ref> to as broadly as 380\u2013800&nbsp;nm.<ref name=\"OhannesianStreeter2001\">{{cite book |last1=Ohannesian |first1=Lena |last2=Streeter |first2=Anthony |title=Handbook of Pharmaceutical Analysis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DwPb4wgqseYC&pg=PA187 |accessdate=20 October 2013 |date=9 November 2001 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0-8247-4194-5 |page=187}}</ref><ref name=\"AhluwaliaGoyal2000\">{{cite book |last1=Ahluwalia |first1=V.K. |last2=Goyal |first2=Madhuri |title=A Textbook of Organic Chemistry |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tJNJnn0M75MC&pg=PA110 |accessdate=20 October 2013 |date=1 January 2000 |publisher=Narosa |isbn=978-81-7319-159-6 |page=110}}</ref> Under ideal laboratory conditions, people can see infrared up to at least 1050&nbsp;nm;<ref name=\"Sliney1976\">{{cite journal |last1=Sliney |first1=David H. |last2=Wangemann |first2=Robert T. |last3=Franks |first3=James K. |last4=Wolbarsht |first4=Myron L. |year=1976 |title=Visual sensitivity of the eye to infrared laser radiation |journal=[[Journal of the Optical Society of America]] |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=339\u2013341 |doi=10.1364/JOSA.66.000339 |pmid=1262982 |quote=The foveal sensitivity to several near-infrared laser wavelengths was measured.

The fixed value of the speed of light in SI units results from the fact that the meter is now defined in terms of the speed of light. All forms of electromagnetic radiation move at exactly this same speed in vacuum.\n\nDifferent [[physicist]]s have attempted to measure the speed of light throughout history. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] attempted to measure the speed of light in the seventeenth century. An early experiment to measure the speed of light was conducted by [[Ole R\u00f8mer]], a Danish physicist, in 1676. Using a [[telescope]], R\u00f8mer observed the motions of [[Jupiter]] and one of its [[natural satellite|moons]], [[Io (moon)|Io]]. Noting discrepancies in the apparent period of Io's orbit, he calculated that light takes about 22 minutes to traverse the diameter of Earth's orbit.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS/Repository/1.0/Disseminate?view=body&id=pdf_1&handle=euclid.ss/1009212817 |title=Scientific Method, Statistical Method and the Speed of Light |journal=Statistical Science |year=2000 |volume=15 |pages=254\u2013278 |issue=3 |doi=10.1214/ss/1009212817 |mr=1847825|last1=Oldford |first1=R.

If R\u00f8mer had known the diameter of the Earth's orbit, he would have calculated a speed of 227,000,000&nbsp;m/s.\n\nAnother more accurate measurement of the speed of light was performed in Europe by [[Hippolyte Fizeau]] in 1849. Fizeau directed a beam of light at a mirror several kilometers away. A rotating [[cog wheel]] was placed in the path of the light beam as it traveled from the source, to the mirror and then returned to its origin.  Fizeau found that at a certain rate of rotation, the beam would pass through one gap in the wheel on the way out and the next gap on the way back. Knowing the distance to the mirror, the number of teeth on the wheel, and the rate of rotation, Fizeau was able to calculate the speed of light as 313,000,000&nbsp;m/s.\n\n[[L\u00e9on Foucault]] carried out an experiment which used rotating mirrors to obtain a value of 298,000,000&nbsp;m/s in 1862. [[Albert A. Michelson]] conducted experiments on the speed of light from 1877 until his death in 1931. He refined Foucault's methods in 1926 using improved rotating mirrors to measure the time it took light to make a round trip from [[Mount Wilson (California)|Mount Wilson]] to [[Mount San Antonio]] in California.

During the time it had \"stopped\" it had ceased to be light.\n\n==Optics==\n{{Main|Optics}}\n\nThe study of light and the interaction of light and [[matter]] is termed [[optics]]. The observation and study of [[optical phenomena]] such as [[rainbow]]s and the [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora borealis]] offer many clues as to the nature of light.\n\n===Refraction===\n{{Main|Refraction}}\n[[File:Refraction-with-soda-straw.jpg|thumb|250 px|An example of refraction of light. The straw appears bent, because of refraction of light as it enters liquid (the water, in this case) from air.]]\n[[File:Cloud in the sunlight.jpg|thumb|250px|A cloud illuminated by sunlight]]\n\nRefraction is the bending of light rays when passing through a surface between one transparent material and another. It is described by [[Snell's Law]]:\n\n:<math>n_1\\sin\\theta_1 = n_2\\sin\\theta_2\\ .</math>\n\nwhere \u03b8<sub>1</sub> is the angle between the ray and the surface [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] in the first medium, \u03b8<sub>2</sub> is the angle between the ray and the surface normal in the second medium, and n<sub>1</sub> and n<sub>2</sub> are the [[Index of refraction|indices of refraction]], ''n'' = 1 in a [[vacuum]] and ''n'' > 1 in a [[Transparency and translucency|transparent]] [[Chemical substance|substance]].\n\nWhen a beam of light crosses the boundary between a vacuum and another medium, or between two different media, the wavelength of the light changes, but the frequency remains constant. If the beam of light is not [[orthogonality|orthogonal]] (or rather normal) to the boundary, the change in wavelength results in a change in the direction of the beam. This change of direction is known as [[refraction]].\n\nThe refractive quality of [[lens (optics)|lenses]] is frequently used to manipulate light in order to change the apparent size of images. [[Magnifying glass]]es, [[Glasses|spectacles]], [[contact lens]]es, [[microscope]]s and [[refracting telescope]]s are all examples of this manipulation.\n\n==Light sources== <!-- This section is linked from [[Source]] -->\n{{Redirect|Lightsource|the solar energy developer named Lightsource|Lightsource Renewable Energy}}\n{{Further|List of light sources}}\nThere are many sources of light. A body at a given temperature emits a characteristic spectrum of [[black-body]] radiation. A simple thermal source is sunlight, the radiation emitted by the [[chromosphere]] of the [[Sun]] at around  {{convert|6000|K|C F|abbr=off}} peaks in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum when plotted in wavelength units<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thulescientific.com/LYNCH%20&%20Soffer%20OPN%201999.pdf |title=Spectrum and the Color Sensitivity of the Eye |website=Thulescientific.com |accessdate=29 August 2017}}</ref> and roughly 44% of sunlight energy that reaches the ground is visible.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/spectra/am1.5/ |title=Reference Solar Spectral Irradiance: Air Mass 1.5 |accessdate=12 November 2009}}</ref> Another example is [[incandescent light bulb]]s, which emit only around 10% of their energy as visible light and the remainder as infrared. A common thermal light source in history is the glowing solid particles in [[fire|flames]], but these also emit most of their radiation in the infrared, and only a fraction in the visible spectrum.\n\nThe peak of the black-body spectrum is in the deep infrared, at about 10 [[micrometer]] wavelength, for relatively cool objects like human beings. As the temperature increases, the peak shifts to shorter wavelengths, producing first a red glow, then a white one, and finally a blue-white color as the peak moves out of the visible part of the spectrum and into the ultraviolet. These colors can be seen when metal is heated to \"red hot\" or \"white hot\". Blue-white [[thermal emission]] is not often seen, except in stars (the commonly seen pure-blue color in a [[natural gas|gas]] flame or a [[welder]]'s torch is in fact due to molecular emission, notably by CH radicals (emitting a wavelength band around 425&nbsp;nm, and is not seen in stars or pure thermal radiation).\n\nAtoms emit and absorb light at characteristic energies. This produces \"[[emission line]]s\" in the spectrum of each atom. [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|Emission]] can be [[spontaneous emission|spontaneous]], as in [[light-emitting diode]]s, [[gas discharge]] lamps (such as [[neon lamp]]s and [[neon sign]]s, [[mercury-vapor lamp]]s, etc.), and flames (light from the hot gas itself\u2014so, for example, [[sodium]] in a gas flame emits characteristic yellow light). Emission can also be [[stimulated emission|stimulated]], as in a [[laser]] or a microwave [[maser]].\n\nDeceleration of a free charged particle, such as an [[electron]], can produce visible radiation: [[cyclotron radiation]], [[synchrotron radiation]], and [[bremsstrahlung]] radiation are all examples of this. Particles moving through a medium faster than the speed of light in that medium can produce visible [[Cherenkov radiation]]. Certain chemicals produce visible radiation by [[chemoluminescence]]. In living things, this process is called [[bioluminescence]]. For example, [[firefly|fireflies]] produce light by this means, and boats moving through water can disturb plankton which produce a glowing wake.\n\nCertain substances produce light when they are illuminated by more energetic radiation, a process known as [[fluorescence]]. Some substances emit light slowly after excitation by more energetic radiation. This is known as [[phosphorescence]]. Phosphorescent materials can also be excited by bombarding them with subatomic particles. [[Cathodoluminescence]] is one example. This mechanism is used in [[cathode ray tube]] [[television set]]s and [[computer monitor]]s.\n\n[[File:Colorful artificial lighting at night.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Hong Kong]] illuminated by colorful artificial [[lighting]].]]\n\nCertain other mechanisms can produce light:\n* [[Bioluminescence]]\n* [[Cherenkov radiation]]\n* [[Electroluminescence]]\n* [[Scintillation (physics)|Scintillation]]\n* [[Sonoluminescence]]\n* [[Triboluminescence]]\n\nWhen the concept of light is intended to include very-high-energy photons (gamma rays), additional generation mechanisms include:\n* Particle\u2013[[antiparticle]] annihilation\n* [[Radioactive decay]]\n\n==Units and measures==\n{{Main|Photometry (optics)|Radiometry}}\n\nLight is measured with two main alternative sets of units: [[radiometry]] consists of measurements of light power at all wavelengths, while [[photometry (optics)|photometry]] measures light with wavelength weighted with respect to a standardized model of human brightness perception.  Photometry is useful, for example, to quantify [[Illumination (lighting)]] intended for human use.  The SI units for both systems are summarized in the following tables.\n\n{{SI radiometry units|1|self|nb}}<!-- parameter 1 for table number, parameter 2 for compare destination page, parameter 3 for reference group -->\n{{SI light units|2|self|nb}}<!-- parameter 1 for table number, parameter 2 for compare destination page, parameter 3 for reference group -->\n\nThe photometry units are different from most systems of physical units in that they take into account how the human eye responds to light. The [[cone cell]]s in the human eye are of three types which respond differently across the visible spectrum, and the cumulative response peaks at a wavelength of around 555&nbsp;nm. Therefore, two sources of light which produce the same intensity (W/m<sup>2</sup>) of visible light do not necessarily appear equally bright. The photometry units are designed to take this into account, and therefore are a better representation of how \"bright\" a light appears to be than raw intensity. They relate to raw [[power (physics)|power]] by a quantity called [[luminous efficacy]], and are used for purposes like determining how to best achieve sufficient illumination for various tasks in indoor and outdoor settings. The illumination measured by a [[photocell]] sensor does not necessarily correspond to what is perceived by the human eye, and without filters which may be costly, photocells and [[charge-coupled device]]s (CCD) tend to respond to some [[infrared]], [[ultraviolet]] or both.\n\n==Light pressure==\n{{Main|Radiation pressure}}\nLight exerts physical pressure on objects in its path, a phenomenon which can be deduced by Maxwell's equations, but can be more easily explained by the particle nature of light: photons strike and transfer their momentum. Light pressure is equal to the power of the light beam divided by ''[[speed of light|c]]'', the speed of light.{{Spaces}} Due to the magnitude of ''c'', the effect of light pressure is negligible for everyday objects.{{Spaces}} For example, a one-milliwatt [[laser pointer]] exerts a force of about 3.3 [[newton (unit)|piconewtons]] on the object being illuminated; thus, one could lift a [[penny (United States coin)|U.S. penny]] with laser pointers, but doing so would require about 30 billion 1-mW laser pointers.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Tang |first=Hong |title=May The Force of Light Be With You |journal=IEEE Spectrum |date=1 October 2009 |volume=46 |issue=10 |pages=46\u201351 |doi=10.1109/MSPEC.2009.5268000}}</ref>{{Spaces}} However, in [[nanometre]]-scale applications such as [[nanoelectromechanical systems]] (|NEMS), the effect of light pressure is more significant, and exploiting light pressure to drive NEMS mechanisms and to flip nanometre-scale physical switches in integrated circuits is an active area of research.<ref>See, for example, [http://www.eng.yale.edu/tanglab/research.htm nano-opto-mechanical systems research at Yale University].</ref> At larger scales, light pressure can cause [[asteroid]]s to spin faster,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2004/feb/asteroids-get-spun-by-the-sun/ |title=Asteroids Get Spun By the Sun |author=Kathy A. |website=Discover Magazine |date=5 February 2004}}</ref> acting on their irregular shapes as on the vanes of a [[windmill]].{{Spaces}} The possibility of making [[solar sail]]s that would accelerate spaceships in space is also under investigation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/roboticexplorers/solar_sails.html |title=Solar Sails Could Send Spacecraft 'Sailing' Through Space |website=NASA |date=31 August 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/news/releases/2004/04-208.html |title=NASA team successfully deploys two solar sail systems |website=NASA |date=9 August 2004}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the motion of the [[Crookes radiometer]] was originally attributed to light pressure, this interpretation is incorrect; the characteristic Crookes rotation is the result of a partial vacuum.<ref>P.

He wrote, \"radiation will exert pressure on both sides of the plate. The forces of pressure exerted on the two sides are equal if the plate is at rest. However, if it is in motion, more radiation will be reflected on the surface that is ahead during the motion (front surface) than on the back surface. The backwardacting force of pressure exerted on the front surface is thus larger than the force of pressure acting on the back. Hence, as the resultant of the two forces, there remains a force that counteracts the motion of the plate and that increases with the velocity of the plate. We will call this resultant 'radiation friction' in brief.\"\n\nUsually light momentum is aligned with its direction of motion.

[[Isaac Newton]] studied Gassendi's work at an early age, and preferred his view to Descartes' theory of the ''plenum''. He stated in his ''Hypothesis of Light'' of 1675 that light was composed of [[Corpuscularianism|corpuscles]] (particles of matter) which were emitted in all directions from a source. One of Newton's arguments against the wave nature of light was that waves were known to bend around obstacles, while light travelled only in straight lines. He did, however, explain the phenomenon of the [[diffraction]] of light (which had been observed by [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi|Francesco Grimaldi]]) by allowing that a light particle could create a localised wave in the [[Aether (classical element)|aether]].\n\nNewton's theory could be used to predict the [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] of light, but could only explain [[refraction]] by incorrectly assuming that light accelerated upon entering a denser [[Medium (optics)|medium]] because the [[gravity|gravitational]] pull was greater. Newton published the final version of his theory in his ''[[Opticks]]'' of 1704. His reputation helped the [[particle theory of light]] to hold sway during the 18th century. The particle theory of light led [[Laplace]] to argue that a body could be so massive that light could not escape from it. In other words, it would become what is now called a [[black hole]]. Laplace withdrew his suggestion later, after a wave theory of light became firmly established as the model for light (as has been explained, neither a particle or wave theory is fully correct). A translation of Newton's essay on light appears in ''The large scale structure of space-time'', by [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[George F. R. Ellis]].\n\nThe fact that light could be [[polarized light|polarized]] was for the first time qualitatively explained by Newton using the particle theory. [[\u00c9tienne-Louis Malus]] in 1810 created a mathematical particle theory of polarization. [[Jean-Baptiste Biot]] in 1812 showed that this theory explained all known phenomena of light polarization. At that time the polarization was considered as the proof of the particle theory.\n\n=== Wave theory ===\nTo explain the origin of [[color]]s, [[Robert Hooke]] (1635\u20131703) developed a \"pulse theory\" and compared the spreading of light to that of waves in water in his 1665 work ''[[Micrographia]]'' (\"Observation IX\"). In 1672 Hooke suggested that light's vibrations could be [[perpendicular]] to the direction of propagation. [[Christiaan Huygens]] (1629\u20131695) worked out a mathematical wave theory of light in 1678, and published it in his ''[[Treatise on light]]'' in 1690. He proposed that light was emitted in all directions as a series of waves in a medium called the ''[[Luminiferous ether]]''.  As waves are not affected by gravity, it was assumed that they slowed down upon entering a denser medium.<ref>Fokko Jan Dijksterhuis, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cPFevyomPUIC Lenses and Waves: Christiaan Huygens and the Mathematical Science of Optics in the 17th Century], Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2004, {{ISBN|1-4020-2697-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Christiaan Huygens-painting.jpeg|thumb|200 px|[[Christiaan Huygens]].]]\n\n[[File:Young Diffraction.png|right|thumb|200px|[[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]]'s sketch of a [[double-slit experiment]] showing [[diffraction]]. Young's experiments supported the theory that light consists of waves.]]\n\nThe wave theory predicted that light waves could interfere with each other like sound waves (as noted around 1800 by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]]). Young showed by means of a [[double-slit experiment|diffraction experiment]] that light behaved as waves. He also proposed that different [[color]]s were caused by different [[wavelength]]s of light, and explained color vision in terms of three-colored receptors in the eye. Another supporter of the wave theory was [[Leonhard Euler]]. He argued in ''Nova theoria lucis et colorum'' (1746) that [[diffraction]] could more easily be explained by a wave theory. In 1816 [[Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re]] gave [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] an idea that the polarization of light can be explained by the wave theory if light were a [[transverse wave]].<ref>James R. Hofmann, ''Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re: Enlightenment and Electrodynamics'', Cambridge University Press, 1996, p. 222.</ref>\n\nLater, Fresnel independently worked out his own wave theory of light, and presented it to the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences]] in 1817. [[Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson]] added to Fresnel's mathematical work to produce a convincing argument in favor of the wave theory, helping to overturn Newton's corpuscular theory.{{dubious|date=June 2018}}<!-- [[Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson]] says he was an opponent of the theory --> By the year 1821, Fresnel was able to show via mathematical methods that polarization could be explained by the wave theory of light if and only if light was entirely transverse, with no longitudinal vibration whatsoever.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nThe weakness of the wave theory was that light waves, like sound waves, would need a medium for transmission. The existence of the hypothetical substance ''luminiferous aether'' proposed by Huygens in 1678 was cast into strong doubt in the late nineteenth century by the [[Michelson\u2013Morley experiment]].\n\nNewton's corpuscular theory implied that light would travel faster in a denser medium, while the wave theory of Huygens and others implied the opposite. At that time, the [[speed of light]] could not be measured accurately enough to decide which theory was correct. The first to make a sufficiently accurate measurement was [[L\u00e9on Foucault]], in 1850.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Understanding Physics |author1=David Cassidy |author2=Gerald Holton |author3=James Rutherford |publisher=Birkh\u00e4user |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-387-98756-9 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=rpQo7f9F1xUC&pg=PA382}}</ref> His result supported the wave theory, and the classical particle theory was finally abandoned, only to partly re-emerge in the 20th century.\n\n===Electromagnetic theory===\n{{Main|Electromagnetic radiation}}\n[[File:light-wave.svg|360px|thumb|A 3\u2013dimensional rendering of [[Polarization (waves)|linearly polarized]] light wave frozen in time and showing the two oscillating components of light; an [[electric field]] and a [[magnetic field]] perpendicular to each other and to the direction of motion (a [[transverse wave]]).]]\n\nIn 1845, [[Michael Faraday]] discovered that the plane of polarization of linearly polarized light is rotated when the light rays travel along the [[magnetic field]] direction in the presence of a transparent [[dielectric]], an effect now known as [[Faraday rotation]].<ref name=\"LongairMalcolm\">{{cite book |last=Longair |first=Malcolm |title=Theoretical Concepts in Physics |year=2003 |page=87}}</ref> This was the first evidence that light was related to [[electromagnetism]].

Maxwell discovered that self-propagating electromagnetic waves would travel through space at a constant speed, which happened to be equal to the previously measured speed of light. From this, Maxwell concluded that light was a form of electromagnetic radiation: he first stated this result in 1862 in ''On Physical Lines of Force''. In 1873, he published ''[[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]]'', which contained a full mathematical description of the behavior of electric and magnetic fields, still known as [[Maxwell's equations]]. Soon after, [[Heinrich Hertz]] confirmed Maxwell's theory experimentally by generating and detecting radio waves in the laboratory, and demonstrating that these waves behaved exactly like visible light, exhibiting properties such as reflection, refraction, diffraction, and interference. Maxwell's theory and Hertz's experiments led directly to the development of modern radio, radar, television, electromagnetic imaging, and wireless communications.\n\nIn the quantum theory, photons are seen as [[wave packet]]s of the waves described in the classical theory of Maxwell. The quantum theory was needed to explain effects even with visual light that Maxwell's classical theory could not (such as [[spectral line]]s).\n\n===Quantum theory===\nIn 1900 [[Max Planck]], attempting to explain [[black-body radiation]] suggested that although light was a wave, these waves could gain or lose energy only in finite amounts related to their frequency. Planck called these \"lumps\" of light energy \"[[quantum|quanta]]\" (from a Latin word for \"how much\"). In 1905, Albert Einstein used the idea of light quanta to explain the [[photoelectric effect]], and suggested that these light quanta had a \"real\" existence. In 1923 [[Arthur Holly Compton]] showed that the wavelength shift seen when low intensity X-rays scattered from electrons (so called [[Compton scattering]]) could be explained by a particle-theory of X-rays, but not a wave theory. In 1926 [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] named these light quanta particles [[photon]]s.<ref>{{Open access}} {{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/IntroductionToMolecularSpectroscopy |title=Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy |last=Barrow |first=Gordon M. |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1962 |format=Scanned PDF |lccn=62-12478}}</ref>\n\nEventually the modern theory of [[quantum mechanics]] came to picture light as (in some sense) ''both'' a particle and a wave, and (in another sense), as a phenomenon which is ''neither'' a particle nor a wave (which actually are macroscopic phenomena, such as baseballs or ocean waves). Instead, modern physics sees light as something that can be described sometimes with mathematics appropriate to one type of macroscopic metaphor (particles), and sometimes another macroscopic metaphor (water waves), but is actually something that cannot be fully imagined. As in the case for radio waves and the X-rays involved in Compton scattering, physicists have noted that electromagnetic radiation tends to behave more like a classical wave at lower frequencies, but more like a classical particle at higher frequencies, but never completely loses all qualities of one or the other. Visible light, which occupies a middle ground in frequency, can easily be shown in experiments to be describable using either a wave or particle model, or sometimes both.\n\nIn February 2018, scientists reported, for the first time, the discovery of a new form of light, which may involve [[polariton]]s, that could be useful in the development of [[quantum computer]]s.<ref name=\"NW-20180216\">{{cite web |last=Hignett |first=Katherine |title=Physics Creates New Form of Light That Could Drive The Quantum Computing Revolution |url=http://www.newsweek.com/photons-light-physics-808862 |date=16 February 2018 |website=Newsweek |accessdate=17 February 2018 }}</ref><ref name=\"SCI-20180216\">{{cite journal |author=Liang, Qi-Yu|display-authors=etal|title=Observation of three-photon bound states in a quantum nonlinear medium |date=16 February 2018 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=359 |issue=6377 |pages=783\u2013786 |doi=10.1126/science.aao7293 |pmid=29449489 |pmc=6467536|arxiv=1709.01478 |bibcode=2018Sci...359..783L }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Physics|Science}}\n{{div col|colwidth=13em}}\n* [[Automotive lighting]]\n* [[Ballistic photon]]\n* [[Black-body radiation]]\n* [[Color temperature]]\n* [[Fermat's principle]]\n* [[Huygens' principle]]\n* [[Incandescent light bulb]]\n* [[International Commission on Illumination]]\n* ''[[Journal of Luminescence]]''\n* [[Light art]]\n* [[Light beam]] \u2013 in particular about light beams visible from the side\n* [[Light Fantastic (TV series)]]\n* [[Light mill]]\n* [[Light painting]]\n* [[Light pollution]]\n* [[Light therapy]]\n* [[Lighting]]\n* [[List of light sources]]\n* ''[[Luminescence: The Journal of Biological and Chemical Luminescence]]''\n* [[Photic sneeze reflex]]\n* [[Photometry (optics)|Photometry]]\n* [[Photon]]\n* [[Right to light]]\n* [[Risks and benefits of sun exposure]]\n* [[Spectroscopy]]\n* [[Visible spectrum]]\n* [[Wave\u2013particle duality]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=nb}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Commons-inline|Light}}\n* {{Wiktionary-inline}}\n* {{Wikiquote-inline}}\n* {{Britannica|340440|Light (physics)}}\n* {{LEDV|27859}}\n{{Radiation}}\n{{Color topics}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2019}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Light| ]]\n[[Category:Radiation]]\n", "name_user": "Commuter3", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLight sources:Spelling", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"}
