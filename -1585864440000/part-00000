[[Japan]] and [[West Germany]] saw large economic growth during this decade. The [[AIDS epidemic]] became recognized in the 1980s and has since killed an estimated 39 million people ({{as of|2013|lc=y}}).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aids.gov/federal-resources/around-the-world/global-aids-overview/|title=Global HIV/AIDS Overview|author=|date=|work=aids.gov|accessdate=16 April 2016}}</ref> [[Global warming]] became well known to the scientific and political community in the 1980s.\n\nThe [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] moved closer to [[Supply-side economics|supply-side economic policies]] beginning a trend towards global instability of international trade that would pick up more steam in the [[1990s|following decade]] as the fall of the USSR made [[right wing]] economic policy more powerful.\n\nThe final decade of the Cold War opened with the US-Soviet confrontation continuing largely without any interruption. Superpower tensions escalated rapidly as President Reagan scrapped the policy of d\u00e9tente and adopted a new, much more aggressive stance on the Soviet Union. The world came perilously close to nuclear war for the first time since the Cuban Missile Crisis 20 years earlier, but the second half of the decade saw a dramatic easing of superpower tensions and ultimately the total collapse of Soviet communism.\n\nDeveloping countries across the world faced economic and social difficulties as they suffered from multiple debt crises in the 1980s, requiring many of these countries to apply for financial assistance from the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[World Bank]]. [[Ethiopia]] witnessed [[1984\u20131985 famine in Ethiopia|widespread famine in the mid-1980s]] during the corrupt rule of [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]], resulting in the country having to depend on foreign aid to provide food to its population and worldwide efforts to address and raise money to help Ethiopians, such as the [[Live Aid]] concert in 1985.\n\nMajor civil discontent and violence occurred in the Middle East, including the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]], the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]], the [[1982 Lebanon War]], the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]], the [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Bombing of Libya in 1986]], and the [[First Intifada]] in the [[Gaza Strip]] and the [[West Bank]]. [[Islamism]] became a powerful political force in the 1980s and many terrorist organizations, including [[Al Qaeda]], started.\n\nBy 1986, nationalism was making a comeback in the Eastern Bloc and desire for democracy in communist-led socialist states combined with economic recession resulted in [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s [[glasnost]] and [[perestroika]], which reduced Communist Party power, legalized dissent and sanctioned limited forms of capitalism such as [[joint venture]]s with Western firms. After newly heated tension for most of the decade, by 1988 relations between the West and East had improved significantly<ref>{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Flora|title=FOREIGN AFFAIRS; Cold War Recedes|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/29/opinion/foreign-affairs-cold-war-recedes.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=May 29, 1988}}</ref> and the Soviet Union was increasingly unwilling to defend its governments in satellite states.\n\n1989 brought the overthrow and attempted overthrow of a number of governments led by communist parties, such as in [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]], the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] in China, the [[Velvet Revolution|Czechoslovak \"Velvet Revolution\"]], [[Erich Honecker]]'s East German regime, Poland's Soviet-backed government, and [[Romanian Revolution|the violent overthrow]] of the [[Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu]] regime in [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]]. Destruction of the 155-km [[Berlin Wall]], at the end of the decade, signalled a seismic geopolitical shift. The [[Cold War]] ended in the early 1990s with the successful [[Reunification of Germany]] and the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|USSR's demise]] after the [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|August Coup]] of 1991.\n\nThe 1980s saw great advances in genetic and digital technology.

Population growth was particularly rapid in a number of African, Middle Eastern, and [[South Asia]]n countries during this decade, with rates of natural increase close to or exceeding 4% annually.\n\nThe 1980s saw the advent of the ongoing practice of [[sex-selective abortion]] in China and India as [[ultrasound]] technology permitted parents to selectively abort baby girls.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/about/journals/ipsrh/2011/09/sex-selective-abortions-during-past-three-decades-may-explain-absence|title=Sex-Selective Abortions During Past Three Decades May Explain Absence of Millions of Girls in India|date=29 September 2011 |publisher= |website=www.guttmacher.org}}</ref>\n\nThe global [[Internet]] took shape in academia by the second half of the 1980s as well as many other [[computer network]]s of both academic and commercial use such as [[USENET]], [[Fidonet]] and the [[Bulletin Board System]].

The attack was done by militants loyal to [[Abu Nidal]], backed by the government of [[Libya]].\n* The [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing]] \u2013 during the [[Lebanese Civil War]] two [[truck bomb]]s struck separate buildings housing United States and French military forces killing 299 American and French servicemen. The organization [[Islamic Jihad Organization|Islamic Jihad]] claimed responsibility for the bombing.\n* [[Air India Flight 182]] was destroyed on June 23, 1985, by Sikh-Canadian militants. It was the biggest mass murder involving Canadians in Canada's history.\n* On December 21, 1988, [[Pan Am Flight 103]] was blown up over the village of Lockerbie, Scotland, while en route from London's Heathrow Airport to New York's JFK. The bombing killed all 243 passengers, 16 crew members and 11 people on the ground, totaling 270 fatalities who were citizens of 21 nationalities. The bombing was and remains the worst terrorist attack on [[UK]] soil.\n\n===Wars===\n{{Main|List of wars 1945\u201389#1980\u20131989}}\nThe most prominent [[armed conflict]]s of the decade include:\n\n====International wars====\n[[File:US Army Rangers parachute into Grenada during Operation Urgent Fury.jpg|thumb|right|[[Invasion of Grenada]], October 1983]]\nThe most notable wars of the decade include:\n* The [[Cold War]] (1947\u20131991)\n** [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]] (1979\u20131989) \u2013 a war fought between the [[Soviet Union]] and the Islamist Mujahideen Resistance in Afghanistan. The mujahideen found other support from a variety of sources including the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] of the [[United States]] (see [[Operation Cyclone]]), as well as [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Pakistan]] and other Muslim nations through the context of the Cold War and the regional India\u2013Pakistan conflict.\n** [[Invasion of Grenada]] (1983) \u2013 a 1983 U.S.-led invasion of [[Grenada]], triggered by a [[military coup]] which ousted a brief [[revolution]]ary government. The successful invasion led to a change of government but was controversial due to charges of [[American imperialism]], [[Cold War]] politics, the involvement of [[Cuba]], the unstable state of the Grenadian government, and Grenada's status as a [[Commonwealth realm]].\n** [[Salvadoran Civil War]] (1980\u20131992) \u2013 part of the cold war conflicts, reached its peak in the 1980s, 70,000 Salvadorans died.\n* Argentina invaded the [[Falkland Islands]], sparking the [[Falklands War]]. It occurred from April 2 to July 14, 1982 between the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Argentina]] as British forces fought to recover the islands. Britain emerged victorious and its stance in international affairs and its long-decaying reputation as a [[Colonialism|colonial power]] received an unexpected boost. The [[military junta]] of Argentina, on the other hand, was left humiliated by the defeat; and its leader [[Leopoldo Galtieri]] was deposed three days after the end of the war. A military investigation known as the [[Rattenbach report]] even recommended his execution.\n* [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict]] (early 20th century \u2013 present)\n** [[1982 Lebanon War]] \u2013 the [[Politics of Israel|Government of Israel]] ordered the invasion as a response to the assassination attempt against Israel's ambassador to the United Kingdom, [[Shlomo Argov]], by the [[Abu Nidal Organization]] and due to the constant terror attacks on northern Israel made by the terrorist organizations which resided in Lebanon. After attacking the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]], as well as [[Syria]]n, leftist and [[Muslim]] [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] forces, Israel occupied southern Lebanon and eventually surrounded the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]] in west [[Beirut]] and subjected to heavy bombardment, they negotiated passage from Lebanon.\n** In October 1985 eight Israeli [[F-15 Eagles]] carried out [[Operation Wooden Leg]] intending to bomb the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]]'s new headquarters in [[Tunis]], [[Tunisia]], more than 2,000&nbsp;km from Israel. The attack cost 270 lives, most of them Tunisian civilians. The attack was later condemned by the [[United Nations Security Council]]. The United States is thought to have assisted or known of the attack.\n* The [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] took place from 1980 to 1988. [[Iraq]] was accused of using illegal [[chemical weapons]] to kill [[Iran]]ian forces and against its own dissident [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] populations. Both sides suffered enormous casualties, but the poorly equipped Iranian armies suffered worse for it, being forced to use soldiers as young as 15 in human-wave attacks. Iran finally agreed to an armistice in 1988.\n* The United States launched an [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|aerial bombardment of Libya]] in 1986 in retaliation for Libyan support of terrorism and attacks on US personnel in Germany and Turkey.\n* The [[South African Border War]] between South Africa and the alliance of [[Angola]], [[Namibia]] and [[Zambia]] ended in 1989, ending over thirty years of conflict.\n* The United States engaged in significant direct and indirect conflict in the decade via alliances with various groups in a number of Central and South American countries claiming that the U.S. was acting to oppose the spread of [[communism]] and end illicit drug trade. The U.S. government supported the government of [[Colombia]]'s attempts to destroy its large illicit [[cocaine]]-trafficking industry and provided support for right-wing military government in the [[Salvadoran civil war]] which became controversial after the [[El Mozote massacre]] on December 11, 1981, in which U.S.-trained Salvadoran paramilitaries killed 1000 Salvadoran civilians. The United States, along with members of the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]], [[Invasion of Grenada|invaded]] [[Grenada]] in 1983. The [[Iran\u2013Contra affair]] erupted which involved U.S. interventionism in [[Nicaragua]], resulting in members of the U.S. government being indicted in 1986. U.S. military action began against [[Panama]] in December 1989 to overthrow its dictator, [[Manuel Noriega]] resulting in 3,500 civilian casualties and the restoration of democratic rule.\n* [[Battle of Cuito Cuanavale]] took place as part of the [[Angolan civil war]] and [[South African Border War]] from 1987 to 1988. The battle involved the largest fighting in Africa since World War II between military forces from [[Angola]], [[Cuba]] (expeditionary forces) and [[Namibia]] versus military forces from South Africa and the dissident Angolan [[UNITA]] organization.\n* The [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] between [[Azerbaijan]] and the [[Armenia]] started in 1988 and lasted six years.\n\n====Civil wars and guerrilla wars====\nThe most notable internal conflicts of the decade include:\n* The [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] occurred in the People's Republic of China in 1989, in which pro-democracy protesters demanded political reform. The protests were crushed by the People's Liberation Army.\n* The [[First Intifada]] (First Uprising) in the [[Gaza Strip]] and [[West Bank]] began in 1987 when Palestinian Arabs mounted large-scale protests against the Israeli military presence in the Gaza Strip and West Bank, largely inhabited by Palestinians. The First Intifada would continue until peace negotiations began between the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] (PLO) and the Israeli government in 1993.\n* [[Lebanese Civil War]] (1975\u20131990) \u2013 Throughout the decade, Lebanon was engulfed in civil war between Islamic and Christian factions.\n* The [[Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front]] began a violent campaign for independence in [[New Caledonia]].\n* [[Greenpeace]]'s attempts to monitor [[French nuclear testing]] on [[Mururoa]] were halted by the sinking of the ''[[Rainbow Warrior (1978)|Rainbow Warrior]]''.\n* The [[Second Sudanese Civil War]] erupts in 1983 between the [[Muslim]] government of [[Sudan]] in the north and non-Muslim rebel secessionists in [[Southern Sudan]]. The conflict continues through the present day [[Darfur genocide]].\n* [[Internal conflict in Peru]]: The communist [[T\u00fapac Amaru Revolutionary Movement]] starts its fight against the Peruvian state in 1980, that would continue until the end of the 1990s.\n* [[Haiti]]an [[dictator]] [[Jean-Claude Duvalier]] was overthrown by a popular uprising on February 6, 1986.\n* [[The Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]] continued.\n\n===Coups===\n{{Main|List of coups d'\u00e9tat and coup attempts#1980 - 1989}}\nThe most prominent [[coups d'\u00e9tat]] of the decade include:\n* A [[1980 Surinamese coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup]] is launched in [[Suriname]] on February 25, 1980; the country's politics are dominated by the military until 1991.\n* [[Nigeria]] suffered multiple [[military coup]]s in 1983 and 1985.\n* [[Sitiveni Rabuka]] staged two [[1987 Fijian coups d'\u00e9tat|military coups in Fiji]] in 1987, and declared the country a [[republic]] the same year.\n* The \"[[Anti-Bureaucratic Revolution]]\" \u2013 a series of interconnected coups d'\u00e9tats \u2013 take place in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] from 1988 to 1989 through mass protests organized and committed by supporters of Serbian politician [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] overthrow the governments of Serbia's autonomous provinces of [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo|Kosovo]] and [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina|Vojvodina]], and the government of [[Socialist Republic of Montenegro|Montenegro]], and finally the main government of [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|Serbia]] with Milo\u0161evi\u0107 becoming [[President of Serbia]].\n\n===Nuclear threats===\n[[File:IAF F-16A Netz 243 CIAF 2004.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Israeli Air Force]] [[F-16A]] Netz '243' that was flown by Colonel [[Ilan Ramon]] during [[Operation Opera]] ]]\n* [[Operation Opera]] \u2013 a 1981 surprise [[Israel]]i [[air strike]] that destroyed the [[Iraq]]i [[nuclear reactor]] being constructed near [[Baghdad]]. Israeli [[military intelligence]] assumed this was for the purpose of [[plutonium]] production to further an Iraqi [[nuclear weapons]] program. Israeli intelligence also believed that the summer of 1981 would be the last chance to destroy the reactor before it would be loaded with [[nuclear fuel]].\n* US President Reagan's decision to station intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Western Europe provoked mass protests involving more than one million people.\n\n===Decolonization and independence===\n* In 1982, Canada gained official independence from the United Kingdom with the [[Canada Act 1982]], authorized by the signature by [[Elizabeth II]]. This act severed all political dependencies of the United Kingdom in Canada (although the Queen remained the head of state).\n* In 1986, Australia gained full independence from the United Kingdom with the [[Australia Act 1986]], which severed the last remaining powers of the British government over the Australian government, including the removal of the privy council as the highest court of appeal.  Australia retained the queen as head of state.\n* In 1986, New Zealand and the United Kingdom fully separated New Zealand's governments from the influence of the British Parliament, resulting in New Zealand's full independence with the [[Constitution Act 1986]] which also reorganised the [[government of New Zealand]].\n* Independence was granted to [[Vanuatu]] from the British/French condominium (1980), [[Kiribati]] from joint US-British government (1981) and [[Palau]] from the United States (1986).\n* [[Zimbabwe]] becomes independent from official colonial rule of the United Kingdom in 1980.\n* Independence was given to [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Belize]] (both 1981), and [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]] (1983) in the Caribbean; and [[Brunei]] in the Far East in 1984\n\n===Prominent political events===\n\n====Americas====\n[[File:Reagan and Gorbachev signing.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. President Reagan and Soviet General Secretary Gorbachev signing the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty|INF Treaty]], 1987]]\n* [[Ronald Reagan]] was elected U.S. President in 1980. In international affairs, Reagan pursued a hardline policy towards preventing the spread of communism, initiating a considerable buildup of U.S. military power to challenge the Soviet Union. He further directly challenged the [[Iron Curtain]] by demanding that the Soviet Union dismantle the [[Berlin Wall]].\n* The [[Reagan Administration]] accelerated the [[War on Drugs]], publicized through anti-drug campaigns including the [[Just Say No]] campaign of First Lady [[Nancy Reagan]]. Drugs gained attention in the US as a serious problem in the '80s. Cocaine was relatively popular among celebrities and affluent youth, while crack, a cheaper offshoot of the drug, was linked to high crime rates in inner cities during the [[American crack epidemic]]. {{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n* The [[Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (1968)]] (PATCO) declared a strike on August 3, 1981, seeking better working conditions, better pay, and a 32-hour workweek. The strike caused considerable disruption of the U.S. air transportation system. Resolution came when [[Ronald Reagan]] fired over 11,000 striking air traffic controllers who had ignored the order, banning them from federal service for life. After seeking appeals, many of the controllers were re-hired while the FAA attempted to replace much of their air traffic control staffing. The remainder continued to be banned until President Clinton lifted the final aspects in 1993. \n* Political unrest in the province of [[Quebec]], which, due to the many differences between the dominant francophone population and the anglophone minority, and also to francophone rights in the predominantly [[Canadian English|English]]-speaking Canada, came to a head in 1980 when the provincial government called a public [[1980 Quebec referendum|referendum]] on partial separation from the rest of Canada. The referendum ended with the \"no\" side winning majority (59.56% no, 40.44% yes).\n* [[Military dictatorship]]s give way to democracy in [[History of Argentina#The democratic transition (from 1983 to today)|Argentina]] (1983), [[History of Uruguay#20th century|Uruguay]] (1984\u201385), [[1980s in Brazil|Brazil]] (1985\u20131988) and [[Chile]] (1988\u201389).\n\n====Europe====\n[[File:BerlinWall-BrandenburgGate.jpg|thumb|right|The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 marked the beginning of German reunification]]\n* The [[European Community]]'s [[Enlargement of the European Union|enlargement]] continued with the accession of Greece in 1981 and Spain and Portugal in 1986.\n* In 1983, [[Bettino Craxi]] became the first [[socialist]] to hold the office of [[Prime Minister of Italy]]; he remained in power until 1987, becoming one of the longest-serving Prime Minister in the history of Italian Republic. At the end of his presidency the [[Mani pulite]] corruption scandal broke up, causing the collapse of the political system.\n* Significant political reforms occurred in a number of communist countries in eastern Europe as the populations of these countries grew increasingly hostile and politically active in opposing communist governments. These reforms included attempts to increase individual liberties and market liberalization, and promises of democratic renewal. The collapse of communism in eastern Europe was generally peaceful, the exception being Romania, whose leader [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]] tried to keep the people isolated from the events happening outside the country. While making a speech in Bucharest in December 1989, he was booed and shouted down by the crowd, and then tried to flee the city with his wife [[Elena Ceau\u0219escu|Elena]]. Two days later, they were captured, charged with genocide, and shot on Christmas.\n* In [[Yugoslavia]], following the death of communist leader [[Josip Broz Tito]] in May 1980, the trend of political reform of the communist system occurred along with a trend towards [[ethnic nationalism]] and inter-ethnic hostility, especially in Serbia, beginning with the 1986 [[Memorandum of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] followed by the agenda of Serbian communist leader [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] who aggressively pushed for increased political influence of Serbs in the late 1980s, condemning non-Serb Yugoslav politicians who challenged his agenda as being enemies of Serbs.\n* There was continuing civil strife in Northern Ireland, including the adoption of hunger strikes by Irish Republican Army prisoners seeking the reintroduction of political status.\n* [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] became leader of the Soviet Union in 1985, and initiated major reforms to the Soviet Union's government through increasing the rights of expressing political dissent and opening elections to opposition candidates (while maintaining legal dominance of the Communist Party). Gorbachev pursued negotiation with the United States to decrease tensions and eventually end the [[Cold War]].\n* At the end of the decade, the [[Fall of the Berlin Wall|fall]] of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989 would be followed in 1990 by the [[German reunification]]. During 1989, most of the communist governments in Eastern Europe collapsed.\n* The United Kingdom was governed by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] under Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], the first female leader of a Western country. Under her [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Premiership]], the party introduced widespread economic reforms including the [[privatisation]] of industries and the de-regulation of [[stock market]]s echoing similar reforms of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Ronald Reagan]]. She was also a staunch opponent of communism, earning her the nickname ''The Iron Lady''.\n* Poor industrial relations marked the beginning of the decade; the [[UK miners' strike (1984\u201385)]] was a major [[industrial action]] affecting the [[Coal mining in the United Kingdom|UK coal industry]]. The strike by the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] (NUM) was led by [[Arthur Scargill]], although some NUM members considered it to be unconstitutional and did not observe it. The [[BBC]] has referred to the strike as \"the most bitter industrial dispute in British history.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=1984: The beginning of the end for British coal |location=London |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/12/newsid_3503000/3503346.stm|accessdate=20 December 2014}}</ref> At its height, the strike involved 142,000 mineworkers, making it the biggest since the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|1926 General Strike]].<ref>{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Strikes Around the World, 1968\u20132005: Case-studies of 15 Countries |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YZ2ms23ZuVQC|location=Amsterdam |publisher=Amsterdam University Press |page=353 |date=2007 |isbn=978-90-5260-285-1}}</ref>\n* In November 1982, [[Leonid Brezhnev]], who had led the Soviet Union since 1964, died. He was followed in quick succession by [[Yuri Andropov]], the former KGB chief, and [[Konstantin Chernenko]], both of whom were in poor health during their short tenures in office.\n\n====Asia====\n* South Korean president [[Chun Doo Hwan]] came to power at the end of 1979 and ruled as a dictator until his presidential term expired in 1987. He was responsible for the [[Kwangju Massacre]] in May 1980 when police and soldiers battled armed protesters. Relations with North Korea showed little sign of improvement during the 1980s. In 1983, when Chun was in Burma, a bomb apparently planted by North Korean agents killed a number of South Korean government officials. After leaving office, he was succeeded by [[Roh Tae Woo]], the first democratic ruler of the country, which saw its international prestige greatly rise with hosting the Olympics in 1988. Roh pursued a policy of normalizing relations with China and the Soviet Union, but had to face militant left-wing student groups who demanded reunification with North Korea and the withdrawal of US troops.\n* In the Philippines, after almost 20 years of dictatorship, Philippine president [[Ferdinand Marcos]] left the presidency and was replaced by [[Corazon Aquino]] through the \"[[People Power Revolution]]\" from February 22 to 25, 1986. This has been considered by some a peaceful revolution despite the fact that the Armed Forces of the Philippines issued an order to disperse the crowds on [[EDSA (road)|EDSA]] (the main thoroughfare in Metro Manila).\n\n===Notable world leaders===\nThis is a list of leaders of states and notable organisations.

The cost of the damage totaled $13 billion (1989 [[United States dollar|USD]]).\n* The [[US Drought of 1988]] decimated the US with many parts of the country affected. This was the worst drought to hit the United States in many years. The drought caused $60 billion in damage (between $80 billion and $120 billion for 2008 [[United States dollar|USD]]). The concurrent [[heat wave]]s killed 5,800 to 17,000 people in the United States.\n* [[Hurricane Allen]] (1980), [[Hurricane Alicia]] (1983), [[Hurricane Gilbert]] (1988), [[Hurricane Joan-Miriam|Hurricane Joan]] (1988), and [[Hurricane Hugo]] (1989) were some notably destructive Atlantic hurricanes of the 1980s.\n* Other natural disasters of the 1980s include the 1982\u20131983 [[El Ni\u00f1o]] which brought destructive weather to most of the world; the 1985 Mexico earthquake, which registered 8.0 on the [[moment magnitude scale]] and devastated Mexico City and other areas throughout central Mexico; the 1985 [[Nevado del Ruiz]] [[lahar]] in [[Colombia]]; the 1986 [[Lake Nyos]] [[limnic eruption]] in [[Cameroon]]; and the [[1988 Armenian earthquake]], which rocked the [[Caucasus]] region of the [[USSR]].\n\n===Non-natural disasters===\n[[File:Challenger explosion.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Space Shuttle Challenger|space shuttle ''Challenger'']] disintegrates on January 28, 1986]]\n\n* On April 25, 1980, [[Dan-Air Flight 1008]] crashed on approach to [[Tenerife]] in the [[Canary Islands]].

This was the greatest act of terrorism until [[September 11 Attacks|9/11]].\n* [[Japan Airlines Flight 123]], carrying 524 people, crashed on August 12, 1985, while on a flight from Tokyo to Osaka killing 520 of the people on board, leaving four survivors. This was, and still is, the worst single-plane crash ever.\n* On December 12, 1985, [[Arrow Air Flight 1285]] crashed seconds after lifting off from [[Gander, Newfoundland]]. All 256 people on board, many of them U.S. servicemen returning home from duty overseas, perished.\n* On January 28, 1986, the NASA [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']] [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|disintegrated]] 73 seconds after launch, killing all of the crew on board. This was the first disaster involving the destruction of a NASA space shuttle. A faulty [[O-ring]] was the cause of the accident.\n* On April 26, 1986, the [[Chernobyl disaster]], a large-scale [[nuclear meltdown]] in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]], [[Soviet Union]], spread a large amount of radioactive material across Europe, killing 47 people, dooming countless others to future radiation-related cancer, and causing the displacement of 300,000 people.\n* On August 31, 1986, [[1986 Cerritos mid-air collision|Aerom\u00e9xico Flight 498]] crashed after colliding with a private [[Piper Cherokee]] over [[Cerritos, California]], killing everyone on both airplanes and several others on the ground.

All 159 aboard were killed.\n* On December 7, 1987, 43 people were killed when an irate former [[US Airways|USAir]] employee went on a rampage aboard [[Pacific Southwest Airlines Flight 1771|PSA Flight 1771]].\n* On December 20, 1987, the [[Philippines|Philippine]] passenger ferry [[MV Do\u00f1a Paz|MV ''Do\u00f1a Paz'']] burned and sank after colliding with the oil tanker [[MT Vector|MT ''Vector'']]. With an estimated death toll of over 4,000, this was and remains the world's deadliest peacetime maritime disaster.\n* On July 3, 1988, [[Iran Air Flight 655]] was shot down by the U.S. missile cruiser [[USS Vincennes (CG-49)|USS ''Vincennes'']] over the [[Strait of Hormuz]], killing all 290 people on the plane.

This was the worst terrorist attack occurred in British soil. \n* On March 24, 1989, the [[oil tanker]] [[Exxon Valdez]] ran aground on [[Bligh Reef]] in [[Alaska]]'s [[Prince William Sound]] spilling an estimated equivalent of 260,000 to 750,000 barrels of crude oil. Although not among the largest oil spills in history, its remote and sensitive location made it one of the most devastating ecological disasters ever. The after effects of the spill continue to be felt to this day.\n* On April 15, 1989, The [[Hillsborough disaster]] occurs during a [[FA Cup]] Semi-Final in [[Sheffield]], England fatally crushing 96 football fans and injuring nearly 1,000 more.\n* On July 19, 1989, [[United Airlines Flight 232]], carrying 296 people, suffered an in-flight engine failure and was forced to crash-land at [[Sioux City, Iowa]]. 185 survived, while 111 were killed when the plane burst into flames upon touchdown.\n\n==Assassinations and attempts==\nProminent assassinations, targeted killings, and assassination attempts include:\n\n* On April 12, 1980, [[William R. Tolbert, Jr.]], the President of [[Liberia]], is killed during a military coup. His death marks the end of [[Americo-Liberian]] rule in Liberia.\n* Musician and former member of [[The Beatles]] [[John Lennon]] was [[Death of John Lennon|assassinated]] in New York City on December 8, 1980.\n* Ronald Reagan was shot in Washington, D.C. on March 30, 1981, by [[John Hinckley]], a mentally disturbed young man who also stalked actress [[Jodie Foster]]. Reagan's press secretary [[James Brady]] was also shot, along with a police officer and a U.S. Secret Service agent. The latter two recovered, along with Reagan himself, but Brady used a wheelchair as a result of brain damage thereafter and would become an advocate of gun control.\n* In May 1981, there was an [[1981 Pope John Paul II assassination attempt|assassination attempt]] on [[Pope]] [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] in [[Saint Peter's Square]]. The would-be assassin was a Turkish man named [[Mehmet Ali Agca]], who was subsequently sentenced to life in prison, but would be pardoned in 2000. At the time, it was widely believed that he was an agent of the Soviet Union or [[Bulgaria]], due to the Pope's vocal anti-communist stance. Agca himself told dozens of conflicting stories over the years, and his motive remains unclear.\n* Egyptian president [[Anwar Sadat]] was [[Assassination of Anwar Sadat|assassinated]] at a military parade in [[Cairo]] on October 6, 1981.\n* Philippine Opposition Senator [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]] was [[Assassination of Benigno Aquino, Jr.|assassinated]] in [[Manila]] on August 21, 1983.\n* American singer-songwriter and musician [[Marvin Gaye]] was [[Death of Marvin Gaye|shot dead]] by his [[Marvin Gay, Sr.|father]] at his home in [[Los Angeles]] on April 1, 1984.\n* Indian prime minister [[Indira Gandhi]] was [[Assassination of Indira Gandhi|assassinated]] on October 31, 1984, by her own [[bodyguard]]s in response to the Indian Army's attack on Golden Temple to destroy [[Sikh]] Militant stronghold in Amritsar earlier in the decade.\n* In 1984, there was an [[Brighton Hotel Bombing|assassination attempt]] on the British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Margaret Thatcher]] and the Conservative Government by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]].\n* Swedish Prime Minister [[Olof Palme]] was [[Assassination of Olof Palme|assassinated]] in February 1986. The assassin has never been identified.\n* On October 15, 1987, the President of [[Burkina Faso]], [[Thomas Sankara]], was killed during a coup d'\u00e9tat organised by his former colleague, [[Blaise Compaor\u00e9]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n<gallery widths=\"180px\" heights=\"120px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Anwar as-Sadat.jpg|On October 6, 1981 Egyptian President [[Anwar Sadat]] was assassinated during an annual victory parade held in Cairo by members of the [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] who participated in the parade wearing military uniform\nFile:Reagan assassination attempt 4.jpg|The attempted assassination of US President [[Ronald Reagan]] on March 30, 1981\nFile:John_Lennon_portrait.jpg|On December 8, 1980 British musician [[John Lennon]] was murdered at front of his house in New York by lone gunman Mark David Chapman\n</gallery>\n\n==Technology==\n\n===Medicine and biology===\nThe 1980s had many fundamental advances in medicine and biology.

But a variety of factors, including a glut of low-quality games and the rise of home computers, caused a [[North American video game crash of 1983|tremendous crash]] in late 1983. For the next three years, the video game market practically ceased to exist in the US. But in the second half of the decade, it would be revived by [[Nintendo]], whose Famicom console and mascot [[Mario]] had been enjoying considerable success in Japan since 1983. Renamed the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], it would claim 90% of the American video game market by 1989. The 1980s are considered to be the decade when video games achieved massive popularity. In 1980, Pac-Man was introduced to the arcades, and became one of the most popular video games of all time. Also in 1980, [[Game & Watch]] was created; it was not one of the most well known game systems, but it facilitated mini-games and was concurrent with the NES. ''[[Donkey Kong]]'', released in 1981, was a smash arcade hit and market breakthrough for [[Nintendo]]. ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'', ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', and the ''[[Mega Man]]'' series would become major hits for the console.\n\n<gallery widths=\"190px\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:NES-Console-Set.jpg|The [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Nintendo Entertainment System's]] Control Deck.\nFile:Atari-7800-wControl-Pad-L.jpg|[[Atari 7800]] System (PAL system with Joypad controller).\nFile:Sega-Mega-Drive-JP-Mk1-Console-Set.jpg|[[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive]], known as the Genesis in North America, succeeded the [[Master System]].\n</gallery>\n\nThe [[personal computer]] experienced explosive growth in the 1980s, transitioning from a hobbyist's toy to a full-fledged consumer product.

[[MSX]] standard was the dominant computer platform in [[Japan]] and in most parts of [[Asia]].

Consumer [[Videocassette recorder|VCR]]s and video rental stores became commonplace as [[VHS]] won out over the competing [[Betamax]] standard. In addition, in the early 1980s various companies began selling compact, modestly priced [[synthesizer]]s to the public. This, along with the development of [[MIDI|Musical Instrument Digital Interface]] (MIDI), made it easier to integrate and synchronize synthesizers and other electronic instruments, like drum machines, for use in musical composition.\n\nHigh definition television (HDTV) of both the analog and digital variety were first developed in the 1980s though their use did not become widespread until the mid-2000s.\n\nIn 1981, [[Hayes Microcomputer Products]] started selling the Smartmodem. The Smartmodem paved the way for the modern modems that exists today, mainly because it was the first modem to transform what had previously required a two-stage process into a process involving only one stage. The Smartmodem contributed to the rise in popularity of [[Bulletin board system|BBS]] systems in the 80s and early 90s, which were the main way to connect to remote computers and perform various social and entertainment activities before the [[Internet]] and the [[World Wide Web]] finally became popular in the mid-90s.\n\n<gallery widths=\"190px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Motorola DynaTAC.jpg|In 1984, the Motorola DynaTAC 8000X becomes the first commercially available '''[[mobile phone]]''' model\nFile:PIC_0011_Samsung_SF100.jpg|During the decade the standardization of Group 3 facsimile terminals by the International Telecommunication Union contributed to the significant spread of the '''[[fax]]''' machine.\nFile:Betavhs2.jpg|[[VHS]] won out over the competing '''[[Betamax]]''' standard, becoming the leading standard in home video systems\nFile:Hayes 300 Baud Smartmodem 02.jpg|[[Hayes Microcomputer Products|Hayes]]'s '''Smartmodem'''\n</gallery>\n\n=== Information technology ===\n* During the decade [[Microsoft]] released the operating systems '''[[MS-DOS]]''' (1981), '''[[Windows 1.0]]''' (1985), and '''[[Windows 2.0]]''' (1987).\n* The '''[[CD]]''' - the most basic CD (\"Digital Audio Compact Disc\") was released in October 1982 for distribution and listening to [[digital audio]], and at the time contained up to 74 minutes of music.\n* '''[[TCP/IP]]''': [[ARPANET]] officially changed its main protocol from NCP to [[TCP/IP]] on January 1, 1983 when the new protocols were activated. The TCP/IP protocol will become the dominant communications protocol from then onwards, and would be used as the foundation on which the [[Internet]] would be based.\n* The '''[[GNU Project]]''' (1983). The '''[[Free Software Foundation]]''' (1985).\n* '''[[FidoNet]]''' - In 1984, FidoNet was launched, enabling [[Bulletin board system|BBS]] users to send private messages (e-mails) and public messages (in the forum) between all BBS systems that were connected to the FidoNet network, in addition to sending files to each other. The rise in popularity and availability of the Internet around the world around the mid-1990s eventually contributed to the irrelevance of FidoNet.\n* '''[[World Wide Web]]''' - In 1989, the British computer scientist [[Tim Berners-Lee]] first proposed a project to his employer [[CERN]], based on the concept of [[hypertext]], to facilitate sharing and updating information among researchers. In mid-November 1989 he would develop the first successful communication between a [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP) client and server via the [[internet]]. In the coming years Berners-Lee developed the system which would later became the foundation of the [[World Wide Web]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"190px\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:CD autolev crop new.jpg|The most basic [[CD]] was first introduced in October 1982 for the purpose of distribution and listening to digital audio\nFile:MS-Dos screenshot.png|In 1981, Microsoft introduced the [[MS-DOS]] operating system, which would become the world's most widely used [[operating system]] in the 1980s and first half of the 1990s.\nFile:Tim Berners-Lee.jpg|In 1989, the British computer scientist [[Tim Berners-Lee]] first proposed the [[World Wide Web]], which he would develop in the coming years\n</gallery>\n\n===Space exploration===\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching.jpg|thumb|The [[Space Shuttle Columbia|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'']] seconds after engine ignition, 1981]]\nAmerican interplanetary probes continued in the 1980s, the Voyager duo being the most known. After making a flyby of Jupiter in 1979, they went near Saturn in 1980\u20131981. Voyager 2 reached Uranus in 1986 (just a few days before the ''Challenger'' disaster), and Neptune in 1989 before the probes exited the solar system.\n\nNo American probes were launched to Mars in the 1980s, and the [[Viking program|Viking]] probes, launched there in 1975, completed their operations by 1982. The Soviets launched two Mars probes in 1988, but they failed.\n\nThe arrival of [[Halley's Comet]] in 1986 was met by a series of Soviet, Japanese and [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) probes, namely [[Halley Armada]].\n\nAfter a six-year hiatus, American space flights with astronauts resumed with the launch of the space shuttle Columbia in April 1981. The shuttle program progressed smoothly from there, with three more orbiters entering service in 1983\u20131985. But that all came to an end with the tragic loss of the [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']] ([[STS-51-L]]) on January 28, 1986, taking with it seven astronauts, including Christa McAuliffe, who was to have been the first teacher in space. In full view of the world, a faulty O-ring on the right solid rocket booster allowed hot gases to burn through the external fuel tank and cause it to explode, destroying the shuttle in the process. Extensive efforts were made to improve [[NASA]]'s increasingly careless management practices, and to make the shuttle safer. Flights resumed with the launch of [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] in September 1988.\n\nThe Soviet program with cosmonauts went well during the decade, experiencing only minor setbacks. The [[Salyut 6]] space station, launched in 1977, was replaced by [[Salyut 7]] in 1982. Then came ''[[Mir]]'' in 1986, which ended up operating for more than a decade, and was destined to be the last in the line of Soviet space stations that had begun in 1971. One of the Soviet Union's last \"superprojects\" was the [[Buran (spacecraft)|''Buran'' space shuttle]]; it was only used once, in 1988.\n\n===Automobiles===\nThe American auto industry began the 1980s in a thoroughly grim situation, faced with poor quality control, rising import competition, and a severe economic downturn.<ref>{{cite journal|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,924408-8,00.html |title=Detroit's Uphill Battle |journal=Time |date=1980-09-08 |first=Alexander |last=Taylor |first2=Christopher |last2=Redman |first3=Barrett |last3=Seaman |accessdate=2015-04-18}}</ref> [[Chrysler]] and [[American Motors]] (AMC) were near bankruptcy, and Ford was little better off.<ref>{{cite journal| first=Alexander |last=Taylor |first2=Christopher |last2=Redman |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,922223-2,00.html|title=Detroit's Road Is Still Rocky |journal=Time |date=1980-12-15 |accessdate=2015-04-18}}</ref> Only GM continued with business as usual. But the auto makers recovered with the economy by 1983, and in 1985 auto sales in the United States hit a new record. However, the Japanese were now a major presence, and would begin manufacturing cars in the US to get around tariffs. In 1986, Hyundai became the first Korean auto maker to enter the American market. In the same year, the Yugoslavian-built [[Zastava Koral|Yugo]] was brought to the US, but the car was so small and cheap, that it became the subject of jokes. It was sold up to 1991, when economic sanctions against Yugoslavia forced its withdrawal from the American market.\n\nAs the decade progressed, cars became smaller and more efficient in design. In 1983, Ford design teams began to incorporate aerodynamic styling to decrease drag while in motion. The Thunderbird was one of the first cars to receive these design changes. In 1985, Ford released the Taurus with a design that was revolutionary among domestic mass market automobiles.\n\nGeneral Motors began suffering significant losses in the late 1980s, partially the result of chairman Roger Smith's restructuring attempts, and partially because of increasingly dated cars. An example were customers who increasingly purchased European luxury cars rather than Cadillacs. In 1985, GM started [[Saturn Corporation|Saturn]] (the first new American make since the Edsel), with the goal of producing high-quality import fighters. Production would not begin until 1990.\n\nChrysler introduced its new compact, front-wheel drive [[Chrysler K platform|K-cars]] in 1981. Under the leadership of Lee Iacocca, the company turned a profit again the following year, and by 1983 paid off its government loans. A succession of models using this automobile platform followed. The most significant were the minivans in 1984. These proved a to be popular and they would dominate the van market for more than a decade. In 1987, Chrysler purchased the Italian makes of Lamborghini and Maserati. In the same year, Chrysler bought AMC from Renault laying to rest the last significant independent U.S. automaker, but acquiring the hugely profitable [[Jeep]] line and continuing the [[Eagle (automobile)|Eagle]] brand until the late 1990s.<ref>{{cite news|last=Holusha |first=John |title=Chrysler is Buying American Motors; Cost is $1.5&nbsp;billion |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/10/business/chrysler-is-buying-american-motors-cost-is-1.5-billion.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=1987-03-10 |accessdate=2015-04-18}}</ref>\n\nThe [[DMC DeLorean]] was the brainchild of [[John DeLorean]], a flamboyant former GM executive. Production of the gull-winged sports car began in Northern Ireland in 1981. John DeLorean was arrested in October 1982 in a sting operation where he was attempting to sell cocaine to save his struggling company. He was acquitted of all charges in 1984, but too late for the DeLorean Motor Company, which closed down in 1983. The DeLorean gained renewed fame afterward as the time machine in the [[Back to the Future (series)|''Back to the Future'' film trilogy]].\n\nThe imposition of CAFE fuel-mileage standards in 1979 spelled the end of big-block engines, but performance cars and convertibles reemerged in the 1980s. Turbochargers were widely used to boost the performance of small cars, and technology from [[fuel injection]] began to take over from the widely used application of [[carburetors]] by the late 1980s. Front-wheel drive also became dominant.\n\nThe Eighties marked the decline of European brands in North America by the end of the decade. [[Renault]], [[Citroen]], and [[Peugeot]] ceased importation by the end of the decade. [[Alfa Romeo]] would continue until 1993. [[Fiat Automobiles|Fiat]] also ceased imports to North America in the Eighties.\n\n==Economics==\n* The early 1980s was marked by a severe global [[Early 1980s recession|economic recession]] that affected much of the developed world.\n* Inflation peaked in the U.S. in April 1980 at 14.76% and subsequently fell to a low of 1.10% in December 1986 but then rebounded to 4.65% at the end of the decade. On the other hand, Finland's economy grew by almost the fastest pace in the world, which eventually culminated in the recession of the 1990s Finnish economy. In Finland, the 1980s were called the \"Nousukausi\", or \"economic upswing\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Inflation and CPI Consumer Price Index 1980\u20131989|url=http://inflationdata.com/articles/inflation-cpi-consumer-price-index-1980-1989/|website=InflationData.com|accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref>\n* International debt crisis in developing countries, reliance of these countries on aid from the [[International Monetary Fund]].\n* Revival of [[laissez-faire economics|laissez faire]]/[[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economics in the developed world led by the UK and US governments emphasising reduced government intervention, lower taxes and deregulation of the stock markets associated with an economic revival in the mid- to late '80s.

Economic problems worsened in 1985 by resignation of most officials of the Mexican government after a failed response of emergency aid in the Mexico City earthquake (September 19) just after the 175th anniversary of Independence holiday (September 16). In 1988, [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] won a controversial presidential election amid charges of voter fraud, bribery, corruption and other abuses of power.\n* Enactment of the [[Canada\u2013United States Free Trade Agreement]] in 1989 to further establish a strong economic bond between the two prosperous neighbor countries of North America.\n* In the [[Soviet Union]], the [[Eleventh Five-Year Plan (Soviet Union)|eleventh Five-Year Plan]] was initiated in 1981 during a [[Era of Stagnation|period of economic stagnation]] that began in the late 1970s. The Plan was a near failure, as most of the targets were not met. With the ascent of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] as [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]], the twelfth Five-Year Plan sought to [[Uskoreniye|accelerate]] and [[Perestroika|restructure]] the Soviet economy through reforms to decentralize production and distribution systems.\n* Under the leadership of [[Deng Xiaoping]], China embarked on extensive reforms in the 1980s, opening the country's economy to the West and allowing capitalist enterprises to operate in a [[Socialism with Chinese characteristics|market socialist system]]. The corruption of [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] leadership was met by dissent from students and workers in the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] which were suppressed by the [[People's Liberation Army]].\n* The [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity movement]] began in Poland in 1980, involving workers demanding political liberalization and democracy in Poland. Attempts by the Communist government to prevent the rise the Solidarity movement failed and negotiations between the movement and the government took place. Solidarity would be instrumental in encouraging people in other communist states to demand political reform.\n* The financial world and the stock market were glamorized in a way they had not been since the 1920s, and figures like [[Donald Trump]] and [[Michael Milken]] were widely seen as symbols of the decade.

Jackson's 1982 album ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' became\u2014and currently remains\u2014the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling album of all time]], with sales estimated by various sources as somewhere between 65 and 110 million copies worldwide. His 1987 album ''[[Bad (album)|Bad]]'' sold over 45 million copies and became the first album to have 5 number 1 singles chart on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Jackson had the most number-one singles throughout the decade (9), and spent the most weeks at #1 (27 weeks). His 1987 [[Bad (tour)|Bad World Tour]] grossed over $125 million worldwide, making it the highest grossing world tour by a solo artist during the decade. Jackson earned numerous awards and titles during the 1980s, the most notable of which were a record 8 [[Grammy Award]]s and 8 [[American Music Award]]s in 1984, and the honor of Artist of the Decade by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George H. W. Bush|George H.W.

His breakthrough album [[1999 (Prince album)|''1999'']], released in 1982, produced three top-ten hits and the album itself charted at No 9. on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. His sixth studio album [[Purple Rain (album)|''Purple Rain'']] was an international success, boosting Prince to superstardom and selling over 25 million copies worldwide. The album produced the US No 1. singles, \"[[When Doves Cry]]\" and \"[[Let's Go Crazy]]\" and sold 13 million copies in the United States as of 1996. Prince released an album every year for the rest of the decade, all charting within the Top 10, with the exception of [[Lovesexy]].

After the 1980s electronic instruments were no longer popular in rock but continued to be the main component of mainstream pop.\n\n[[Hard rock]], [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], and [[glam metal]] became some of the most dominant music genres of the decade, peaking with the arrival of such bands as [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]], [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Metallica]], [[Iron Maiden]], [[Bon Jovi]], [[Def Leppard]], [[Poison (American band)|Poison]], [[Europe (band)|Europe]], [[Megadeth]], [[Slayer]], [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], and [[virtuoso]] guitarists such as [[Joe Satriani]] and [[Yngwie Malmsteen]]. The scene also helped 1970s hard rock artists such as [[AC/DC]], [[Heart (band)|Heart]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[Deep Purple]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Van Halen]], [[Kiss (band)|KISS]], [[Ronnie James Dio]], and [[Judas Priest]] reach a new generation of fans.\n\nBy 1989, the [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] scene had evolved, gaining recognition and exhibiting a stronger influence on the music industry. This time period is also considered part of the [[golden age hip hop|golden age]] of hip hop. The [[Beastie Boys]], [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]], [[Run\u2013D.M.C.|Run-D.M.C.]], [[Grandmaster Flash]], the [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five|Furious Five]], [[Boogie Down Productions]], [[N.W.A]], [[LL Cool J]], [[De La Soul]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]], [[EPMD]], [[Eric B. & Rakim]], [[Ice-T]], [[DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince]], [[2 Live Crew]], [[Tone L\u014dc]], [[Biz Markie]], the [[Jungle Brothers]], [[The Sugar Hill Gang]] and others experienced success in this genre.\n\n[[Country music]] catapulted into a new realm of popularity with youth appeal and record-breaking marks. Groundbreaking artists such as [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]], [[Hank Williams, Jr.]], [[Reba McEntire]], [[George Strait]], [[Ricky Skaggs]], [[Janie Fricke]], [[The Judds]], and [[Randy Travis]] achieved multiple platinum and award status, foreshadowing the genre's popularity explosion in the 1990s. Country legends from prior decades, however; such as [[George Jones]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Conway Twitty]], the [[Oak Ridge Boys]], [[Kenny Rogers]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Merle Haggard]], [[Don Williams]], [[Crystal Gayle]], [[Ronnie Milsap]], [[Barbara Mandrell]], and the [[Statler Brothers]]; also continued to score hits throughout the decade.\n\nThe [[techno]] style of electronic dance music emerged in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], during the mid- to late 1980s. The [[house music]] style, another form of electronic dance music, emerged in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], in the early 1980s. It was initially popularized in mid-1980s discoth\u00e8ques catering to the African-American, Latino and gay communities, first in Chicago, then in New York City and Detroit. It eventually reached Europe before becoming infused in mainstream pop and dance music worldwide.\n\n[[Punk rock]] continued to make strides in the musical community. With bands leading the significance of this period such as [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], [[Bad Brains]], [[Minor Threat]], [[Suicidal Tendencies]], [[D.O.A. (band)|D.O.A.]], [[Bad Religion]], [[Minutemen (band)|Minutemen]], [[Social Distortion]], and [[Dead Kennedys]], it gave birth to many subgenres like [[Hardcore punk|hardcore]], which has continued to be moderately successful, giving birth in turn to a few counterculture movements, most notably the [[Straight Edge]] movement which began in the early era of this decade. [[College rock]] caught on in the underground scene of the 1980s in a nationwide movement with a distinct [[DIY ethic|D.I.Y]] approach. Bands like the [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]], [[R.E.M.]], [[The Replacements (band)|The Replacements]], [[Sonic Youth]], [[XTC]], [[The Smiths]], [[H\u00fcsker D\u00fc]], [[The Stone Roses]], [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]] etc. experienced success in this genre.

In the mid 1980s, a wave of British directors, including [[Ridley Scott]], [[Alan Parker]], [[Adrian Lyne]] and [[Tony Scott]] (with the latter directing a number of Don Simpson films) ushered in a new era of blockbusters using the crowd-pleasing skills they had honed in UK television commercials.<ref>{{cite news|first=Delaney|last=Sam|title=Jets, jeans and Hovis|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/aug/24/1|agency=''The Guardian''|date=August 24, 2007|access-date=March 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe '80s also saw the golden age of \"[[teen film|teen flicks]]\" and also spawned the [[Brat Pack (actors)|Brat Pack]] films, many of which were directed by [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]]. Films such as ''[[Class (film)|Class]]'', ''[[The Breakfast Club]]'', ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]'', ''[[Mannequin (1987 film)|Mannequin]]'', ''[[Porky's]]'', ''[[Pretty in Pink]]'', ''[[Sixteen Candles]]'', ''[[St. Elmo's Fire (film)|St. Elmo's Fire]]'', ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'', ''[[Weird Science (film)|Weird Science]]'', and ''[[Valley Girl (1983 film)|Valley Girl]]'' were popular teen comedies of the era and launched the careers of several major celebrities such as: [[Emilio Estevez]], [[Anthony Michael Hall]], [[Forest Whitaker]], [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]], [[Andrew McCarthy]], [[Judd Nelson]], [[Molly Ringwald]], [[Sean Penn]], [[Nicolas Cage]] and [[Michael J Fox]]. Other popular films included ''[[About Last Night...]]'', ''[[Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure]]'', ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'', ''[[Flashdance]]'', ''[[Footloose (1984 film)|Footloose]]'', ''[[Raging Bull]]'' and ''[[St. Elmo's Fire (film)|St. Elmo's Fire]]'' which also launched the careers of high-profile celebrities like [[Demi Moore]], [[Joe Pesci]], [[Keanu Reeves]], [[Kevin Bacon]], [[Rob Lowe]], [[Patrick Swayze]], and [[River Phoenix]].\n\nHorror films were a popular genre during the decade, with several notable horror franchises being born during the 1980s. Among the most popular were the ''[[Child's Play (film series)|Child's Play]]'', ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'', ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'', ''[[Hellraiser (franchise)|Hellraiser]]'', and ''[[Poltergeist (film series)|Poltergeist]]'' franchises. Aside from these films, the concept of the [[B movie|B horror film]] gave rise to a plethora of horror films that went on to earn a cult status. An example of such is the 1981 film ''[[The Evil Dead]]'', ''[[Pink Floyd \u2013 The Wall]]'' marked the directorial debut of [[Sam Raimi]]. Comedy horror films such as ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' and ''[[Gremlins]]'' also gained cult status.\n\nSeveral action film franchises were also launched during the 1980s. The most popular of these were the ''[[Beverly Hills Cop (film series)|Beverly Hills Cop]], [[Die Hard (franchise)|Die Hard]], [[Lethal Weapon (film series)|Lethal Weapon]]'', and ''[[Rambo (film series)|Rambo]]'' franchises. Other action films from the decade which are of notable status include ''[[The Terminator]]'', ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'', and ''[[RoboCop]]''. These films propelled the careers of modern celebrities such as [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Bruce Willis]], [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Mel Gibson]], [[Sylvester Stallone]] and   [[Chuck Norris]] to international recognition. On the other side of the globe, [[Hong Kong action cinema]] was being revolutionized by a new wave of inventive filmmakers that includes [[Jackie Chan]], [[Tsui Hark]], and [[John Woo]].\n\nFive more [[James bond films]] were released, with [[Roger Moore]] continuing in the role in ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'', ''[[Octopussy (film)|Octopussy]]'', and ''[[A View to a Kill (film)|A View To A Kill]]'', before handing over the role to [[Timothy Dalton]] who starred in ''[[The Living Daylights (film)|The Living Daylights]]'' and ''[[Licence to Kill (film)|Licence To Kill]]''.\n\nA significant development in the home media business is the establishment of [[The Criterion Collection]] in 1984, an American company \"dedicated to gathering the greatest films from around the world and publishing them in editions that offer the highest technical quality\". Through their releases, they were able to introduce what is now a standard to home video: [[Letterboxing (filming)|letterboxing]] to retain the original aspect ratio, [[Audio commentary|film commentaries]] and supplements/special features.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Criterion|url=https://www.criterion.com/about_us|website=The Criterion Collection|publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]]|accessdate=26 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author1=Wadham College|title=Frame by Frame|url=https://www.wadham.ox.ac.uk/news/2014/october/frame-by-frame|accessdate=27 February 2016|work=[[Wadham College, Oxford|Wadham College, University of Oxford]]|publisher=Wadham College, University of Oxford|date=28 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nAlthough [[animated feature films]] did not gained mainstream popularity until the mid-1990s due to public preference of TV animation, some imporant films were produced during the decade. Ater leaving [[Disney]] in 1979, [[Don Bluth]] formed [[Sullivan Bluth Studios|his own studio]] and went on direct ''[[The Secret of NIMH]]'', ''[[An American Tail]]'', ''[[The Land Before Time]]'' and ''[[All Dogs Go To Heaven]]''. At the same time, [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|the Disney studio]] wasn't having good times and almost bankrupted after ''[[The Black Cauldron (film)|The Black Cauldron]]'' bombed at the box office. However, in later years, they slowly recovered with the modest success of [[Ron Clements]] and [[John Musker]] directed ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]'' and eventually regained public confidence following the release of  ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]''. Other animated films from the decade also gained notable status: Films based on popular works include ''[[Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown (and Don't Come Back!!)]]'',  ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Mark Twain (1985 film)|The Adventures of Mark Twain]]'', ''[[The Care Bears Movie]]'', ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]'', ''[[The Chipmunk Adventure]]'' and ''[[Daffy Duck's Quackbusters]]''; while original films include ''[[The Last Unicorn (film)|The Last Unicorn]]'', ''[[The Plague Dogs (film)|The Plague Dogs]]'', ''[[Rock & Rule]]'', ''[[Fire and Ice (1983 film)|Fire and Ice]]'', ''[[The Brave Little Toaster]]'' and ''[[Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland]]''.\n\nThe '80s also saw a surge of [[Anime|Japanese anime films]]: [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s ''[[Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (film)|Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind]]'' was extremely successful enough to lead the foundation of [[Studio Ghibli]] which would then produce several successful films of the decade including ''[[Castle in the Sky]]'', ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]'', ''[[Grave of the Fireflies]]'' and ''[[Kiki's Delivery Service]]''. Other well-known anime films of that decade include ''[[Golgo 13: The Professional]]'', ''[[Macross: Do You Remember Love?]]'', ''[[Lensman (1984 film)|Lensman]]'', ''[[Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honneamise]]'', and ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]''. Additionally, the first-ever theatrical animated franchise: [[List of Doraemon films|the Doraemon film series]] (based on the [[Doraemon|anime and manga series of the same name]]) began in 1980 with the release of ''[[Doraemon: Nobita's Dinosaur]]''.\n\n=== Actors / Entertainers ===\n{{Div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Nancy Allen (actress)|Nancy Allen]]\n* [[Kirstie Alley]]\n* [[Harry Anderson]]\n* [[Julie Andrews]]\n* [[Alan Arkin]]\n* [[Rosanna Arquette]]\n* [[Bea Arthur]]\n* [[Dan Aykroyd]]\n* [[Amitabh Bachchan]]\n* [[Alec Baldwin]]\n* [[Kim Basinger]]\n* [[Meredith Baxter]]\n* [[Ned Beatty]]\n* [[Ed Begley Jr.]]\n* [[James Belushi]]\n* [[John Belushi]]\n* [[Tom Berenger]]\n* [[Sandahl Bergman]]\n* [[Michael Biehn]]\n* [[Linda Blair]]\n* [[Lisa Bonet]]\n* [[Ernest Borgnine]]\n* [[Eric Braeden]]\n* [[Jeff Bridges]]\n* [[Matthew Broderick]]\n* [[Pierce Brosnan]]\n* [[Clancy Brown]]\n* [[Delta Burke]]\n* [[Nicolas Cage]]\n* [[Michael Caine]]\n* [[Kirk Cameron]]\n* [[Bruce Campbell]]\n* [[John Candy]]\n* [[David Carradine]]\n* [[Dixie Carter]]\n* [[Jackie Chan]]\n* [[Chevy Chase]]\n* [[John Cleese]]\n* [[Glenn Close]]\n* [[James Coburn]]\n* [[Mindy Cohn]]\n* [[Joan Collins]]\n* [[Maria Conchita Alonso]]\n* [[Sean Connery]]\n* [[Bill Cosby]]\n* [[Kevin Costner]]\n* [[Ronny Cox]]\n* [[Tom Cruise]]\n* [[Billy Crystal]]\n* [[Jamie Lee Curtis]]\n* [[Tony Curtis]]\n* [[Willem Dafoe]]\n* [[William Daniels]]\n* [[Ted Danson]]\n* [[Tony Danza]]\n* [[Robert Davi]]\n* [[Geena Davis]]\n* [[Rae Dawn Chong]]\n* [[Daniel Day-Lewis]]\n* [[Dom DeLuise]]\n* [[Robert De Niro]]\n* [[Bruce Dern]]\n* [[Danny DeVito]]\n* [[Joyce DeWitt]]\n* [[Matt Dillon]]\n* [[Michael Douglas]]\n* [[Richard Dreyfuss]]\n* [[Fred Dryer]]\n* [[Patrick Duffy]]\n* [[Bill Duke]]\n* [[Robert Duvall]]\n* [[Clint Eastwood]]\n* [[Sam Elliott]]\n* [[R.

[[Cable television]] became more accessible and therefore, more popular. By the middle of the decade, almost 70% of the American population had cable television and over 85% were paying for cable services such as [[HBO]] or [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]].<ref>[http://eightiesclub.tripod.com/id13.htm The Politics and Pop Culture of the 1980s] The Eighties Club.

The Islanders also became the second [[NHL]] expansion team after the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] to win the Cup. Since their last Cup win in 1983, they were the third NHL team to win 4 consecutive championships and hold the NHL record for most consecutive playoff series' wins at 19 (stretching from the [[1980 Stanley Cup Playoffs|1980 Playoffs]] to the [[1984 Stanley Cup Finals|1984 Playoffs]]).\n* The [[Edmonton Eskimos]] of the [[Canadian Football League]] win the first three [[Grey Cup]] championships of the decade (having won the last two of the previous decade), adding one more in 1987.\n* The [[1983 Cricket World Cup]] was won by [[India]] while [[1987 Cricket World Cup]] was won by [[Australia]].\n* The [[1984 Winter Olympics]] were held in [[Sarajevo]], [[Yugoslavia]] (now Sarajevo, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]). Yugoslavia became the second communist country to host the [[Olympic Games]], but unlike the Soviet Union in 1980, there were no boycotts of the Games by Western countries.\n* The [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in Los Angeles were boycotted by the Soviet Union and most of the Communist world (China, Romania, and Yugoslavia participated in the games) in retaliation for the boycott of the 1980 Games in Moscow.\n* The [[Jamaica national bobsled team]] received major media attention and stunned the world at the [[1988 Winter Olympics]] in [[Calgary|Calgary, Alberta]], Canada for its unexpected good performance. The events surrounding the Jamaica bobsled team in 1988 would lead to the creation of the [[Disney]] movie ''[[Cool Runnings]]'' five years later.\n* The [[1988 Summer Olympics]] were held in [[Seoul]], South Korea. Attempts to include North Korea in the games were unsuccessful and it boycotted along with six other countries, but with 160 nations participating, it had the highest attendance of any Olympics to date.\n* [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] bans [[Group B]] [[rallying]] after a series of deaths and injuries take place in the 1986 season.\n* Canadian hockey player [[Wayne Gretzky]]'s rise to fame in the NHL coincided with the [[Edmonton Oilers]]' first 4 Stanley Cup championships ([[1984 Stanley Cup Finals|1984]], [[1985 Stanley Cup Finals|1985]], [[1987 Stanley Cup Finals|1987]], and [[1988 Stanley Cup Finals|1988]]) and becoming the second NHL [[dynasty (sports)|dynasty]] team of the 1980s.\n* On August 9, 1988, in what became the biggest trade in NHL history (also known as \"The Trade Of The Century\"), Wayne Gretzky was traded along with teammates [[Marty McSorley]] and [[Mike Krushelnyski]] from Edmonton to the [[Los Angeles Kings]] in exchange for [[Martin G\u00e9linas]], [[Jimmy Carson]], three first round draft picks, and US$15 million cash (approximately $18 million [[Canadian dollar|CAD]] in 1988).\n* American basketball player [[Michael Jordan]] burst onto the scene in the NBA during the 1980s, bringing a surge in popularity for the sport and becoming one of the most beloved sports icons in the United States.\n* On June 8, 1986, the [[Boston Celtics]] defeat the [[Houston Rockets]] in Game 6 of the [[1986 NBA Finals]] to capture a record 16th championship. [[Larry Bird]] is named [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|Finals MVP]].\n* On November 26, 1986, [[Mike Tyson]] became the youngest boxing Heavyweight Champion in history at age 20.\n* On March 31, 1985, the [[WWE|WWF]] presented the first [[WrestleMania]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]] with an attendance of 19,121.\n* On March 29, 1987, [[WrestleMania III]] had a record attendance of 93,173; the largest recorded attendance for a live indoor sporting event in North America until 2010. This also remained the WrestleMania attendance record until [[WrestleMania 32]] at [[AT&T Stadium]] on April 3, 2016, in Arlington, Texas\n* West Germany won the 1980 UEFA championship.\n* Italy won the 1982 FIFA World Cup in Spain.\n* France hosted and won the 1984 UEFA championship.\n* Argentina won the 1986 FIFA World Cup in Mexico.\n* The Netherlands won the 1988 UEFA championship.\n* [[Hawthorn Football Club]] dominated Australian football, reaching seven successive VFL Grand Finals and winning the premiership in 1983, 1986, 1988, and 1989\n* [[Liverpool F.C.]] were the most successful club side of the era, becoming English champions on six occasions (1980, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1986, and 1988) and winning two European Cups (1981, 1984). They also won the FA Cup in 1986, completing the first double in their history, and four consecutive [[League Cup]] titles from 1981 to 1984.\n* Other highly successful club sides of the 1980s include [[Juventus]] (7 major honours won), [[Real Madrid]] (10 major honors won), [[Bayern Munich]] (9 titles won) [[PSV Eindhoven]] (4 times Dutch champions and European Cup winners in 1988), and [[Clube de Regatas do Flamengo|Flamengo]] (4 times Brazilian champions, South American and International Cup winners in 1981).\n* In the [[NFL]], the [[San Francisco 49ers]] became the dynasty of the decade, winning four Super Bowls under the leadership of [[Joe Montana]]; the [[Chicago Bears]] won [[Super Bowl XX]] in January 1986, in which the team has been widely remembered for their [[1985 Chicago Bears season|defense]]; the [[Washington Redskins]] also enjoyed success throughout the decade, winning two of their three Super Bowls under the leadership of head coach [[Joe Gibbs]].\n* [[Magic Johnson]] and [[Larry Bird]] became the two most popular NBA players during the decade while even facing against each other in three [[NBA Finals]] ([[1984 NBA Finals|1984]], [[1985 NBA Finals|1985]], and [[1987 NBA Finals|1987]]) continuing the storied [[Celtics-Lakers rivalry]].\n* [[Major League Baseball]] experienced parity and tense championship moments during the decade as the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] won their first World Series championship in [[1980 World Series|1980]], the [[Kansas City Royals]] win their first World Series championship in dramatic fashion in [[1985 World Series|1985]], the [[New York Mets]] win their second World Series championship in [[1986 World Series|1986]] in dramatic fashion, the [[Minnesota Twins]] win their first World Series in [[1987 World Series|1987]], and both the [[1988 World Series|1988]] and [[1989 World Series]] be remembered as [[Kirk Gibson's 1988 World Series home run]], and the [[Loma Prieta Earthquake]] taking place occurring at 5:04 respectively.\n* [[Ultimate (sport)|Disc ultimate]] league play is introduced to Canada in 1980 by [[Ken Westerfield]] starting the first [[Ultimate Canada#History|disc ultimate league (TUC)]], in Toronto.\n\n=== Sports figures ===\n{{Div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]]\n* [[Marcus Allen]]\n* [[Franco Baresi]]\n* [[Boris Becker]]\n* [[Larry Bird]]\n* [[Wade Boggs]]\n* [[Mike Bossy]]\n* [[George Brett]]\n* [[Maurice Cheeks]]\n* [[Kenny Dalglish]]\n* [[Eric Dickerson]]\n* [[John Elway]]\n* [[Julius Erving]]\n* [[Chris Evert]]\n* [[Dan Fouts]]\n* [[Grant Fuhr]]\n* [[Steffi Graf]]\n* [[Wayne Gretzky]]\n* [[Ruud Gullit]]\n* [[Tony Gwynn]]\n* [[Rickey Henderson]]\n* [[Evander Holyfield]]\n* [[Bo Jackson]]\n* [[Magic Johnson]]\n* [[Michael Jordan]]\n* [[Florence Griffith Joyner]]\n* [[Jackie Joyner-Kersee]]\n* [[Ivan Lendl]]\n* [[Sugar Ray Leonard]]\n* [[Carl Lewis]]\n* [[Gary Lineker]]\n* [[Ronnie Lott]]\n* [[Moses Malone]]\n* [[Diego Maradona]]\n* [[Dan Marino]]\n* [[Lothar Matth\u00e4us]]\n* [[John McEnroe]]\n* [[Kevin McHale (basketball)|Kevin McHale]]\n* [[Mark Messier]]\n* [[Cheryl Miller]]\n* [[Joe Montana]]\n* [[Martina Navratilova]]\n* [[Robert Parish]]\n* [[Walter Payton]]\n* [[Michel Platini]]\n* [[Denis Potvin]]\n* [[Kirby Puckett]]\n* [[Mary Lou Retton]]\n* [[Jerry Rice]]\n* [[Frank Rijkaard]]\n* [[Cal Ripken Jr.]]\n* [[Bryan Robson]]\n* [[Paolo Rossi]]\n* [[Karl-Heinz Rummenigge]]\n* [[Nolan Ryan]]\n* [[Mike Schmidt]]\n* [[Peter Shilton]]\n* [[Mike Singletary]]\n* [[Ozzie Smith]]\n* [[Lawrence Taylor]]\n* [[Isiah Thomas]]\n* [[Bryan Trottier]]\n* [[Mike Tyson]]\n* [[Marco van Basten]]\n* [[Rudi V\u00f6ller]]\n* [[Dominique Wilkins]]\n* [[Kellen Winslow]]\n* [[James Worthy]]\n* [[Dino Zoff]]\n* [[Zico]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Video gaming===\n{{See also|1980s in video gaming}}\n[[File:NES-Console-Set.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) was released in the mid-1980s and became the [[List of best-selling game consoles|best-selling gaming console]] of its time]]\nPopular video games include: ''[[Pac-Man]]'', ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', ''[[Metroid]]'', ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', ''[[Frogger]]'', ''[[Digger (video game)|Digger]]'', ''[[Tetris]]'', and ''[[Golden Axe]]''.\n''[[Pac-Man]]'' (1980) was the first game to achieve widespread popularity in mainstream culture and the first game character to be popular in his own right.\nHandheld [[History of video games#Handheld LCD games|electronic LCD games]] was introduced into the youth market segment.\nThe primary gaming computers of the 1980s emerged in 1982: the [[Commodore 64]] and [[ZX Spectrum]].\n[[Nintendo]] finally decided in 1985 to release its Famicom (released in 1983 in Japan) in the United States under the name [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES). It was bundled with ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' and it suddenly became a success. The NES dominated the American and Japanese market until the rise of the next generation of consoles in the early 1990s, causing some to call this time the ''[[Nintendo era]]''.\n[[Sega]] released its 16-bit console, [[Mega Drive|Mega Drive/Genesis]], in 1988 in Japan and in North America in 1989.\nIn 1989, Nintendo released the [[Game Boy]], a monochrome handheld console.\n{{Clear}}\n\n<gallery widths=\"190\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Donkey Kong arcade - zapwizard 34102189 (cropped).jpg|The popular 1980s arcade game ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]''\nFile:Game_%26_Watch_WS-_Snoopy_Tennis.jpg|[[Game & Watch]] was the popular mobile game during the decade until it was replaced in the early 1990s with more advanced [[Game Boy]].\nFile:PacmanUserbox.gif|The game ''[[Pac-Man]]'' (1980) became immensely popular and an icon of 1980s popular culture\n</gallery>\n\n===Fashion===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2016}}\nThe beginning of the decade saw the continuation of the clothing styles of the [[1970s in fashion|late 1970s]] and evolved into [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] fashion by the end. However, it had a lot of changes considering that, this fashion became more and more extravagant during the 80s. The 80s included things like teased hair, ripped jeans, neon clothing and lots of colours and different designs which at first weren't accepted for a lot of people.\n\nSignificant hairstyle trends of the 1980s include the [[Perm (hairstyle)|perm]], the [[Mullet (haircut)|mullet]], the [[Jheri curl]], the [[hi-top fade]], and [[big hair]].\n\nSignificant clothing trends of the 1980s include [[Shoulder pads (fashion)#1980s|shoulder pads]], [[Denim|jean jackets]], [[leather]] pants, [[aviator jacket]]s, [[jumpsuit]]s, [[Members Only (fashion brand)|Members Only jackets]], [[Slim-fit pants#The 1980s|skin-tight acid-washed jeans]], Izod and \"Preppy\" polo shirts, [[leggings]] and [[leg warmer]]s (popularized in the film ''[[Flashdance]]''), off-the-shoulder shirts, and cut sweatshirts (again, popularized in the film ''[[Flashdance]]''). [[Miniskirt]]s made a dramatic comeback in the mid-1980s after a ten-year absence. Makeup on the 1980s was aggressive, shining and colorful. They gave big attention to their lips, eyebrows and cheeks. They used a lot of [[Rouge (cosmetics)|blush]] and a big [[Eye liner|eyeliner]] was always necessary.\n\nAdditional significant trends of the 1980s include [[headband]]s, [[Ray-Ban Aviator]] sunglasses (popularized in the film ''[[Top Gun]]''), [[Ray-Ban Wayfarer|Ray-Ban Wayfarer sunglasses]] (popularized in the films ''[[Risky Business]]'' and ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' and the TV series ''[[Miami Vice]]''), [[Swatch#A fashion statement|Swatch watches]], and the [[Rubik's Cube]] (became a popular fad throughout the decade).

[[Japan]] and [[West Germany]] saw large economic growth during this decade. The [[AIDS epidemic]] became recognized in the 1980s and has since killed an estimated 39 million people ({{as of|2013|lc=y}}).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aids.gov/federal-resources/around-the-world/global-aids-overview/|title=Global HIV/AIDS Overview|author=|date=|work=aids.gov|accessdate=16 April 2016}}</ref> [[Global warming]] became well known to the scientific and political community in the 1980s.\n\nThe [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] moved closer to [[Supply-side economics|supply-side economic policies]] beginning a trend towards global instability of international trade that would pick up more steam in the [[1990s|following decade]] as the fall of the USSR made [[right wing]] economic policy more powerful.\n\nThe final decade of the Cold War opened with the US-Soviet confrontation continuing largely without any interruption. Superpower tensions escalated rapidly as President Reagan scrapped the policy of d\u00e9tente and adopted a new, much more aggressive stance on the Soviet Union. The world came perilously close to nuclear war for the first time since the Cuban Missile Crisis 20 years earlier, but the second half of the decade saw a dramatic easing of superpower tensions and ultimately the total collapse of Soviet communism.\n\nDeveloping countries across the world faced economic and social difficulties as they suffered from multiple debt crises in the 1980s, requiring many of these countries to apply for financial assistance from the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[World Bank]].

[[Islamism]] became a powerful political force in the 1980s and many terrorist organizations, including [[Al Qaeda]], started.\n\nBy 1986, nationalism was making a comeback in the Eastern Bloc and desire for democracy in communist-led socialist states combined with economic recession resulted in [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s [[glasnost]] and [[perestroika]], which reduced Communist Party power, legalized dissent and sanctioned limited forms of capitalism such as [[joint venture]]s with Western firms.

Destruction of the 155-km [[Berlin Wall]], at the end of the decade, signalled a seismic geopolitical shift. The [[Cold War]] ended in the early 1990s with the successful [[Reunification of Germany]] and the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|USSR's demise]] after the [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|August Coup]] of 1991.\n\nThe 1980s saw great advances in genetic and digital technology.

Population growth was particularly rapid in a number of African, Middle Eastern, and [[South Asia]]n countries during this decade, with rates of natural increase close to or exceeding 4% annually.\n\nThe 1980s saw the advent of the ongoing practice of [[sex-selective abortion]] in China and India as [[ultrasound]] technology permitted parents to selectively abort baby girls.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/about/journals/ipsrh/2011/09/sex-selective-abortions-during-past-three-decades-may-explain-absence|title=Sex-Selective Abortions During Past Three Decades May Explain Absence of Millions of Girls in India|date=29 September 2011 |publisher= |website=www.guttmacher.org}}</ref>\n\nThe global [[Internet]] took shape in academia by the second half of the 1980s as well as many other [[computer network]]s of both academic and commercial use such as [[USENET]], [[Fidonet]] and the [[Bulletin Board System]].

The attack was done by militants loyal to [[Abu Nidal]], backed by the government of [[Libya]].\n* The [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing]] \u2013 during the [[Lebanese Civil War]] two [[truck bomb]]s struck separate buildings housing United States and French military forces killing 299 American and French servicemen. The organization [[Islamic Jihad Organization|Islamic Jihad]] claimed responsibility for the bombing.\n* [[Air India Flight 182]] was destroyed on June 23, 1985, by Sikh-Canadian militants. It was the biggest mass murder involving Canadians in Canada's history.\n* On December 21, 1988, [[Pan Am Flight 103]] was blown up over the village of Lockerbie, Scotland, while en route from London's Heathrow Airport to New York's JFK. The bombing killed all 243 passengers, 16 crew members and 11 people on the ground, totaling 270 fatalities who were citizens of 21 nationalities.

The mujahideen found other support from a variety of sources including the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] of the [[United States]] (see [[Operation Cyclone]]), as well as [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Pakistan]] and other Muslim nations through the context of the Cold War and the regional India\u2013Pakistan conflict.\n** [[Invasion of Grenada]] (1983) \u2013 a 1983 U.S.-led invasion of [[Grenada]], triggered by a [[military coup]] which ousted a brief [[revolution]]ary government. The successful invasion led to a change of government but was controversial due to charges of [[American imperialism]], [[Cold War]] politics, the involvement of [[Cuba]], the unstable state of the Grenadian government, and Grenada's status as a [[Commonwealth realm]].\n** [[Salvadoran Civil War]] (1980\u20131992) \u2013 part of the cold war conflicts, reached its peak in the 1980s, 70,000 Salvadorans died.\n* Argentina invaded the [[Falkland Islands]], sparking the [[Falklands War]]. It occurred from April 2 to July 14, 1982 between the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Argentina]] as British forces fought to recover the islands. Britain emerged victorious and its stance in international affairs and its long-decaying reputation as a [[Colonialism|colonial power]] received an unexpected boost. The [[military junta]] of Argentina, on the other hand, was left humiliated by the defeat; and its leader [[Leopoldo Galtieri]] was deposed three days after the end of the war. A military investigation known as the [[Rattenbach report]] even recommended his execution.\n* [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict]] (early 20th century \u2013 present)\n** [[1982 Lebanon War]] \u2013 the [[Politics of Israel|Government of Israel]] ordered the invasion as a response to the assassination attempt against Israel's ambassador to the United Kingdom, [[Shlomo Argov]], by the [[Abu Nidal Organization]] and due to the constant terror attacks on northern Israel made by the terrorist organizations which resided in Lebanon. After attacking the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]], as well as [[Syria]]n, leftist and [[Muslim]] [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] forces, Israel occupied southern Lebanon and eventually surrounded the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]] in west [[Beirut]] and subjected to heavy bombardment, they negotiated passage from Lebanon.\n** In October 1985 eight Israeli [[F-15 Eagles]] carried out [[Operation Wooden Leg]] intending to bomb the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]]'s new headquarters in [[Tunis]], [[Tunisia]], more than 2,000&nbsp;km from Israel. The attack cost 270 lives, most of them Tunisian civilians. The attack was later condemned by the [[United Nations Security Council]]. The United States is thought to have assisted or known of the attack.\n* The [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] took place from 1980 to 1988. [[Iraq]] was accused of using illegal [[chemical weapons]] to kill [[Iran]]ian forces and against its own dissident [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] populations. Both sides suffered enormous casualties, but the poorly equipped Iranian armies suffered worse for it, being forced to use soldiers as young as 15 in human-wave attacks. Iran finally agreed to an armistice in 1988.\n* The United States launched an [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|aerial bombardment of Libya]] in 1986 in retaliation for Libyan support of terrorism and attacks on US personnel in Germany and Turkey.\n* The [[South African Border War]] between South Africa and the alliance of [[Angola]], [[Namibia]] and [[Zambia]] ended in 1989, ending over thirty years of conflict.\n* The United States engaged in significant direct and indirect conflict in the decade via alliances with various groups in a number of Central and South American countries claiming that the U.S. was acting to oppose the spread of [[communism]] and end illicit drug trade. The U.S. government supported the government of [[Colombia]]'s attempts to destroy its large illicit [[cocaine]]-trafficking industry and provided support for right-wing military government in the [[Salvadoran civil war]] which became controversial after the [[El Mozote massacre]] on December 11, 1981, in which U.S.-trained Salvadoran paramilitaries killed 1000 Salvadoran civilians. The United States, along with members of the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]], [[Invasion of Grenada|invaded]] [[Grenada]] in 1983. The [[Iran\u2013Contra affair]] erupted which involved U.S. interventionism in [[Nicaragua]], resulting in members of the U.S. government being indicted in 1986. U.S. military action began against [[Panama]] in December 1989 to overthrow its dictator, [[Manuel Noriega]] resulting in 3,500 civilian casualties and the restoration of democratic rule.\n* [[Battle of Cuito Cuanavale]] took place as part of the [[Angolan civil war]] and [[South African Border War]] from 1987 to 1988. The battle involved the largest fighting in Africa since World War II between military forces from [[Angola]], [[Cuba]] (expeditionary forces) and [[Namibia]] versus military forces from South Africa and the dissident Angolan [[UNITA]] organization.\n* The [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] between [[Azerbaijan]] and the [[Armenia]] started in 1988 and lasted six years.\n\n====Civil wars and guerrilla wars====\nThe most notable internal conflicts of the decade include:\n* The [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] occurred in the People's Republic of China in 1989, in which pro-democracy protesters demanded political reform. The protests were crushed by the People's Liberation Army.\n* The [[First Intifada]] (First Uprising) in the [[Gaza Strip]] and [[West Bank]] began in 1987 when Palestinian Arabs mounted large-scale protests against the Israeli military presence in the Gaza Strip and West Bank, largely inhabited by Palestinians. The First Intifada would continue until peace negotiations began between the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] (PLO) and the Israeli government in 1993.\n* [[Lebanese Civil War]] (1975\u20131990) \u2013 Throughout the decade, Lebanon was engulfed in civil war between Islamic and Christian factions.\n* The [[Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front]] began a violent campaign for independence in [[New Caledonia]].\n* [[Greenpeace]]'s attempts to monitor [[French nuclear testing]] on [[Mururoa]] were halted by the sinking of the ''[[Rainbow Warrior (1978)|Rainbow Warrior]]''.\n* The [[Second Sudanese Civil War]] erupts in 1983 between the [[Muslim]] government of [[Sudan]] in the north and non-Muslim rebel secessionists in [[Southern Sudan]]. The conflict continues through the present day [[Darfur genocide]].\n* [[Internal conflict in Peru]]: The communist [[T\u00fapac Amaru Revolutionary Movement]] starts its fight against the Peruvian state in 1980, that would continue until the end of the 1990s.\n* [[Haiti]]an [[dictator]] [[Jean-Claude Duvalier]] was overthrown by a popular uprising on February 6, 1986.\n* [[The Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]] continued.\n\n===Coups===\n{{Main|List of coups d'\u00e9tat and coup attempts#1980 - 1989}}\nThe most prominent [[coups d'\u00e9tat]] of the decade include:\n* A [[1980 Surinamese coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup]] is launched in [[Suriname]] on February 25, 1980; the country's politics are dominated by the military until 1991.\n* [[Nigeria]] suffered multiple [[military coup]]s in 1983 and 1985.\n* [[Sitiveni Rabuka]] staged two [[1987 Fijian coups d'\u00e9tat|military coups in Fiji]] in 1987, and declared the country a [[republic]] the same year.\n* The \"[[Anti-Bureaucratic Revolution]]\" \u2013 a series of interconnected coups d'\u00e9tats \u2013 take place in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] from 1988 to 1989 through mass protests organized and committed by supporters of Serbian politician [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] overthrow the governments of Serbia's autonomous provinces of [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo|Kosovo]] and [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina|Vojvodina]], and the government of [[Socialist Republic of Montenegro|Montenegro]], and finally the main government of [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|Serbia]] with Milo\u0161evi\u0107 becoming [[President of Serbia]].\n\n===Nuclear threats===\n[[File:IAF F-16A Netz 243 CIAF 2004.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Israeli Air Force]] [[F-16A]] Netz '243' that was flown by Colonel [[Ilan Ramon]] during [[Operation Opera]] ]]\n* [[Operation Opera]] \u2013 a 1981 surprise [[Israel]]i [[air strike]] that destroyed the [[Iraq]]i [[nuclear reactor]] being constructed near [[Baghdad]]. Israeli [[military intelligence]] assumed this was for the purpose of [[plutonium]] production to further an Iraqi [[nuclear weapons]] program. Israeli intelligence also believed that the summer of 1981 would be the last chance to destroy the reactor before it would be loaded with [[nuclear fuel]].\n* US President Reagan's decision to station intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Western Europe provoked mass protests involving more than one million people.\n\n===Decolonization and independence===\n* In 1982, Canada gained official independence from the United Kingdom with the [[Canada Act 1982]], authorized by the signature by [[Elizabeth II]]. This act severed all political dependencies of the United Kingdom in Canada (although the Queen remained the head of state).\n* In 1986, Australia gained full independence from the United Kingdom with the [[Australia Act 1986]], which severed the last remaining powers of the British government over the Australian government, including the removal of the privy council as the highest court of appeal.  Australia retained the queen as head of state.\n* In 1986, New Zealand and the United Kingdom fully separated New Zealand's governments from the influence of the British Parliament, resulting in New Zealand's full independence with the [[Constitution Act 1986]] which also reorganised the [[government of New Zealand]].\n* Independence was granted to [[Vanuatu]] from the British/French condominium (1980), [[Kiribati]] from joint US-British government (1981) and [[Palau]] from the United States (1986).\n* [[Zimbabwe]] becomes independent from official colonial rule of the United Kingdom in 1980.\n* Independence was given to [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Belize]] (both 1981), and [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]] (1983) in the Caribbean; and [[Brunei]] in the Far East in 1984\n\n===Prominent political events===\n\n====Americas====\n[[File:Reagan and Gorbachev signing.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. President Reagan and Soviet General Secretary Gorbachev signing the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty|INF Treaty]], 1987]]\n* [[Ronald Reagan]] was elected U.S. President in 1980. In international affairs, Reagan pursued a hardline policy towards preventing the spread of communism, initiating a considerable buildup of U.S. military power to challenge the Soviet Union. He further directly challenged the [[Iron Curtain]] by demanding that the Soviet Union dismantle the [[Berlin Wall]].\n* The [[Reagan Administration]] accelerated the [[War on Drugs]], publicized through anti-drug campaigns including the [[Just Say No]] campaign of First Lady [[Nancy Reagan]]. Drugs gained attention in the US as a serious problem in the '80s. Cocaine was relatively popular among celebrities and affluent youth, while crack, a cheaper offshoot of the drug, was linked to high crime rates in inner cities during the [[American crack epidemic]]. {{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n* The [[Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (1968)]] (PATCO) declared a strike on August 3, 1981, seeking better working conditions, better pay, and a 32-hour workweek. The strike caused considerable disruption of the U.S. air transportation system. Resolution came when [[Ronald Reagan]] fired over 11,000 striking air traffic controllers who had ignored the order, banning them from federal service for life. After seeking appeals, many of the controllers were re-hired while the FAA attempted to replace much of their air traffic control staffing. The remainder continued to be banned until President Clinton lifted the final aspects in 1993. \n* Political unrest in the province of [[Quebec]], which, due to the many differences between the dominant francophone population and the anglophone minority, and also to francophone rights in the predominantly [[Canadian English|English]]-speaking Canada, came to a head in 1980 when the provincial government called a public [[1980 Quebec referendum|referendum]] on partial separation from the rest of Canada. The referendum ended with the \"no\" side winning majority (59.56% no, 40.44% yes).\n* [[Military dictatorship]]s give way to democracy in [[History of Argentina#The democratic transition (from 1983 to today)|Argentina]] (1983), [[History of Uruguay#20th century|Uruguay]] (1984\u201385), [[1980s in Brazil|Brazil]] (1985\u20131988) and [[Chile]] (1988\u201389).\n\n====Europe====\n[[File:BerlinWall-BrandenburgGate.jpg|thumb|right|The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 marked the beginning of German reunification]]\n* The [[European Community]]'s [[Enlargement of the European Union|enlargement]] continued with the accession of Greece in 1981 and Spain and Portugal in 1986.\n* In 1983, [[Bettino Craxi]] became the first [[socialist]] to hold the office of [[Prime Minister of Italy]]; he remained in power until 1987, becoming one of the longest-serving Prime Minister in the history of Italian Republic. At the end of his presidency the [[Mani pulite]] corruption scandal broke up, causing the collapse of the political system.\n* Significant political reforms occurred in a number of communist countries in eastern Europe as the populations of these countries grew increasingly hostile and politically active in opposing communist governments. These reforms included attempts to increase individual liberties and market liberalization, and promises of democratic renewal. The collapse of communism in eastern Europe was generally peaceful, the exception being Romania, whose leader [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]] tried to keep the people isolated from the events happening outside the country. While making a speech in Bucharest in December 1989, he was booed and shouted down by the crowd, and then tried to flee the city with his wife [[Elena Ceau\u0219escu|Elena]]. Two days later, they were captured, charged with genocide, and shot on Christmas.\n* In [[Yugoslavia]], following the death of communist leader [[Josip Broz Tito]] in May 1980, the trend of political reform of the communist system occurred along with a trend towards [[ethnic nationalism]] and inter-ethnic hostility, especially in Serbia, beginning with the 1986 [[Memorandum of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] followed by the agenda of Serbian communist leader [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] who aggressively pushed for increased political influence of Serbs in the late 1980s, condemning non-Serb Yugoslav politicians who challenged his agenda as being enemies of Serbs.\n* There was continuing civil strife in Northern Ireland, including the adoption of hunger strikes by Irish Republican Army prisoners seeking the reintroduction of political status.\n* [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] became leader of the Soviet Union in 1985, and initiated major reforms to the Soviet Union's government through increasing the rights of expressing political dissent and opening elections to opposition candidates (while maintaining legal dominance of the Communist Party). Gorbachev pursued negotiation with the United States to decrease tensions and eventually end the [[Cold War]].\n* At the end of the decade, the [[Fall of the Berlin Wall|fall]] of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989 would be followed in 1990 by the [[German reunification]]. During 1989, most of the communist governments in Eastern Europe collapsed.\n* The United Kingdom was governed by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] under Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], the first female leader of a Western country. Under her [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Premiership]], the party introduced widespread economic reforms including the [[privatisation]] of industries and the de-regulation of [[stock market]]s echoing similar reforms of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Ronald Reagan]]. She was also a staunch opponent of communism, earning her the nickname ''The Iron Lady''.\n* Poor industrial relations marked the beginning of the decade; the [[UK miners' strike (1984\u201385)]] was a major [[industrial action]] affecting the [[Coal mining in the United Kingdom|UK coal industry]]. The strike by the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] (NUM) was led by [[Arthur Scargill]], although some NUM members considered it to be unconstitutional and did not observe it. The [[BBC]] has referred to the strike as \"the most bitter industrial dispute in British history.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=1984: The beginning of the end for British coal |location=London |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/12/newsid_3503000/3503346.stm|accessdate=20 December 2014}}</ref> At its height, the strike involved 142,000 mineworkers, making it the biggest since the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|1926 General Strike]].<ref>{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Strikes Around the World, 1968\u20132005: Case-studies of 15 Countries |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YZ2ms23ZuVQC|location=Amsterdam |publisher=Amsterdam University Press |page=353 |date=2007 |isbn=978-90-5260-285-1}}</ref>\n* In November 1982, [[Leonid Brezhnev]], who had led the Soviet Union since 1964, died. He was followed in quick succession by [[Yuri Andropov]], the former KGB chief, and [[Konstantin Chernenko]], both of whom were in poor health during their short tenures in office.\n\n====Asia====\n* South Korean president [[Chun Doo Hwan]] came to power at the end of 1979 and ruled as a dictator until his presidential term expired in 1987. He was responsible for the [[Kwangju Massacre]] in May 1980 when police and soldiers battled armed protesters. Relations with North Korea showed little sign of improvement during the 1980s. In 1983, when Chun was in Burma, a bomb apparently planted by North Korean agents killed a number of South Korean government officials. After leaving office, he was succeeded by [[Roh Tae Woo]], the first democratic ruler of the country, which saw its international prestige greatly rise with hosting the Olympics in 1988. Roh pursued a policy of normalizing relations with China and the Soviet Union, but had to face militant left-wing student groups who demanded reunification with North Korea and the withdrawal of US troops.\n* In the Philippines, after almost 20 years of dictatorship, Philippine president [[Ferdinand Marcos]] left the presidency and was replaced by [[Corazon Aquino]] through the \"[[People Power Revolution]]\" from February 22 to 25, 1986. This has been considered by some a peaceful revolution despite the fact that the Armed Forces of the Philippines issued an order to disperse the crowds on [[EDSA (road)|EDSA]] (the main thoroughfare in Metro Manila).\n\n===Notable world leaders===\nThis is a list of leaders of states and notable organisations.

The cost of the damage totaled $13 billion (1989 [[United States dollar|USD]]).\n* The [[US Drought of 1988]] decimated the US with many parts of the country affected. This was the worst drought to hit the United States in many years. The drought caused $60 billion in damage (between $80 billion and $120 billion for 2008 [[United States dollar|USD]]). The concurrent [[heat wave]]s killed 5,800 to 17,000 people in the United States.\n* [[Hurricane Allen]] (1980), [[Hurricane Alicia]] (1983), [[Hurricane Gilbert]] (1988), [[Hurricane Joan-Miriam|Hurricane Joan]] (1988), and [[Hurricane Hugo]] (1989) were some notably destructive Atlantic hurricanes of the 1980s.\n* Other natural disasters of the 1980s include the 1982\u20131983 [[El Ni\u00f1o]] which brought destructive weather to most of the world; the 1985 Mexico earthquake, which registered 8.0 on the [[moment magnitude scale]] and devastated Mexico City and other areas throughout central Mexico; the 1985 [[Nevado del Ruiz]] [[lahar]] in [[Colombia]]; the 1986 [[Lake Nyos]] [[limnic eruption]] in [[Cameroon]]; and the [[1988 Armenian earthquake]], which rocked the [[Caucasus]] region of the [[USSR]].\n\n===Non-natural disasters===\n[[File:Challenger explosion.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Space Shuttle Challenger|space shuttle ''Challenger'']] disintegrates on January 28, 1986]]\n\n* On April 25, 1980, [[Dan-Air Flight 1008]] crashed on approach to [[Tenerife]] in the [[Canary Islands]].

This was the greatest act of terrorism until [[September 11 Attacks|9/11]].\n* [[Japan Airlines Flight 123]], carrying 524 people, crashed on August 12, 1985, while on a flight from Tokyo to Osaka killing 520 of the people on board, leaving four survivors. This was, and still is, the worst single-plane crash ever.\n* On December 12, 1985, [[Arrow Air Flight 1285]] crashed seconds after lifting off from [[Gander, Newfoundland]]. All 256 people on board, many of them U.S. servicemen returning home from duty overseas, perished.\n* On January 28, 1986, the NASA [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']] [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|disintegrated]] 73 seconds after launch, killing all of the crew on board. This was the first disaster involving the destruction of a NASA space shuttle. A faulty [[O-ring]] was the cause of the accident.\n* On April 26, 1986, the [[Chernobyl disaster]], a large-scale [[nuclear meltdown]] in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]], [[Soviet Union]], spread a large amount of radioactive material across Europe, killing 47 people, dooming countless others to future radiation-related cancer, and causing the displacement of 300,000 people.\n* On August 31, 1986, [[1986 Cerritos mid-air collision|Aerom\u00e9xico Flight 498]] crashed after colliding with a private [[Piper Cherokee]] over [[Cerritos, California]], killing everyone on both airplanes and several others on the ground.

All 159 aboard were killed.\n* On December 7, 1987, 43 people were killed when an irate former [[US Airways|USAir]] employee went on a rampage aboard [[Pacific Southwest Airlines Flight 1771|PSA Flight 1771]].\n* On December 20, 1987, the [[Philippines|Philippine]] passenger ferry [[MV Do\u00f1a Paz|MV ''Do\u00f1a Paz'']] burned and sank after colliding with the oil tanker [[MT Vector|MT ''Vector'']]. With an estimated death toll of over 4,000, this was and remains the world's deadliest peacetime maritime disaster.\n* On July 3, 1988, [[Iran Air Flight 655]] was shot down by the U.S. missile cruiser [[USS Vincennes (CG-49)|USS ''Vincennes'']] over the [[Strait of Hormuz]], killing all 290 people on the plane.

This was the worst terrorist attack occurred in British soil. \n* On March 24, 1989, the [[oil tanker]] [[Exxon Valdez]] ran aground on [[Bligh Reef]] in [[Alaska]]'s [[Prince William Sound]] spilling an estimated equivalent of 260,000 to 750,000 barrels of crude oil. Although not among the largest oil spills in history, its remote and sensitive location made it one of the most devastating ecological disasters ever. The after effects of the spill continue to be felt to this day.\n* On April 15, 1989, The [[Hillsborough disaster]] occurs during a [[FA Cup]] Semi-Final in [[Sheffield]], England fatally crushing 96 football fans and injuring nearly 1,000 more.\n* On July 19, 1989, [[United Airlines Flight 232]], carrying 296 people, suffered an in-flight engine failure and was forced to crash-land at [[Sioux City, Iowa]]. 185 survived, while 111 were killed when the plane burst into flames upon touchdown.\n\n==Assassinations and attempts==\nProminent assassinations, targeted killings, and assassination attempts include:\n\n* On April 12, 1980, [[William R. Tolbert, Jr.]], the President of [[Liberia]], is killed during a military coup. His death marks the end of [[Americo-Liberian]] rule in Liberia.\n* Musician and former member of [[The Beatles]] [[John Lennon]] was [[Death of John Lennon|assassinated]] in New York City on December 8, 1980.\n* Ronald Reagan was shot in Washington, D.C. on March 30, 1981, by [[John Hinckley]], a mentally disturbed young man who also stalked actress [[Jodie Foster]]. Reagan's press secretary [[James Brady]] was also shot, along with a police officer and a U.S. Secret Service agent. The latter two recovered, along with Reagan himself, but Brady used a wheelchair as a result of brain damage thereafter and would become an advocate of gun control.\n* In May 1981, there was an [[1981 Pope John Paul II assassination attempt|assassination attempt]] on [[Pope]] [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] in [[Saint Peter's Square]]. The would-be assassin was a Turkish man named [[Mehmet Ali Agca]], who was subsequently sentenced to life in prison, but would be pardoned in 2000. At the time, it was widely believed that he was an agent of the Soviet Union or [[Bulgaria]], due to the Pope's vocal anti-communist stance. Agca himself told dozens of conflicting stories over the years, and his motive remains unclear.\n* Egyptian president [[Anwar Sadat]] was [[Assassination of Anwar Sadat|assassinated]] at a military parade in [[Cairo]] on October 6, 1981.\n* Philippine Opposition Senator [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]] was [[Assassination of Benigno Aquino, Jr.|assassinated]] in [[Manila]] on August 21, 1983.\n* American singer-songwriter and musician [[Marvin Gaye]] was [[Death of Marvin Gaye|shot dead]] by his [[Marvin Gay, Sr.|father]] at his home in [[Los Angeles]] on April 1, 1984.\n* Indian prime minister [[Indira Gandhi]] was [[Assassination of Indira Gandhi|assassinated]] on October 31, 1984, by her own [[bodyguard]]s in response to the Indian Army's attack on Golden Temple to destroy [[Sikh]] Militant stronghold in Amritsar earlier in the decade.\n* In 1984, there was an [[Brighton Hotel Bombing|assassination attempt]] on the British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Margaret Thatcher]] and the Conservative Government by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]].\n* Swedish Prime Minister [[Olof Palme]] was [[Assassination of Olof Palme|assassinated]] in February 1986. The assassin has never been identified.\n* On October 15, 1987, the President of [[Burkina Faso]], [[Thomas Sankara]], was killed during a coup d'\u00e9tat organised by his former colleague, [[Blaise Compaor\u00e9]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n<gallery widths=\"180px\" heights=\"120px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Anwar as-Sadat.jpg|On October 6, 1981 Egyptian President [[Anwar Sadat]] was assassinated during an annual victory parade held in Cairo by members of the [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] who participated in the parade wearing military uniform\nFile:Reagan assassination attempt 4.jpg|The attempted assassination of US President [[Ronald Reagan]] on March 30, 1981\nFile:John_Lennon_portrait.jpg|On December 8, 1980 British musician [[John Lennon]] was murdered at front of his house in New York by lone gunman Mark David Chapman\n</gallery>\n\n==Technology==\n\n===Medicine and biology===\nThe 1980s had many fundamental advances in medicine and biology.

But a variety of factors, including a glut of low-quality games and the rise of home computers, caused a [[North American video game crash of 1983|tremendous crash]] in late 1983. For the next three years, the video game market practically ceased to exist in the US. But in the second half of the decade, it would be revived by [[Nintendo]], whose Famicom console and mascot [[Mario]] had been enjoying considerable success in Japan since 1983. Renamed the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], it would claim 90% of the American video game market by 1989. The 1980s are considered to be the decade when video games achieved massive popularity. In 1980, Pac-Man was introduced to the arcades, and became one of the most popular video games of all time. Also in 1980, [[Game & Watch]] was created; it was not one of the most well known game systems, but it facilitated mini-games and was concurrent with the NES. ''[[Donkey Kong]]'', released in 1981, was a smash arcade hit and market breakthrough for [[Nintendo]]. ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'', ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', and the ''[[Mega Man]]'' series would become major hits for the console.\n\n<gallery widths=\"190px\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:NES-Console-Set.jpg|The [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Nintendo Entertainment System's]] Control Deck.\nFile:Atari-7800-wControl-Pad-L.jpg|[[Atari 7800]] System (PAL system with Joypad controller).\nFile:Sega-Mega-Drive-JP-Mk1-Console-Set.jpg|[[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive]], known as the Genesis in North America, succeeded the [[Master System]].\n</gallery>\n\nThe [[personal computer]] experienced explosive growth in the 1980s, transitioning from a hobbyist's toy to a full-fledged consumer product.

[[MSX]] standard was the dominant computer platform in [[Japan]] and in most parts of [[Asia]].

Consumer [[Videocassette recorder|VCR]]s and video rental stores became commonplace as [[VHS]] won out over the competing [[Betamax]] standard. In addition, in the early 1980s various companies began selling compact, modestly priced [[synthesizer]]s to the public. This, along with the development of [[MIDI|Musical Instrument Digital Interface]] (MIDI), made it easier to integrate and synchronize synthesizers and other electronic instruments, like drum machines, for use in musical composition.\n\nHigh definition television (HDTV) of both the analog and digital variety were first developed in the 1980s though their use did not become widespread until the mid-2000s.\n\nIn 1981, [[Hayes Microcomputer Products]] started selling the Smartmodem. The Smartmodem paved the way for the modern modems that exists today, mainly because it was the first modem to transform what had previously required a two-stage process into a process involving only one stage. The Smartmodem contributed to the rise in popularity of [[Bulletin board system|BBS]] systems in the 80s and early 90s, which were the main way to connect to remote computers and perform various social and entertainment activities before the [[Internet]] and the [[World Wide Web]] finally became popular in the mid-90s.\n\n<gallery widths=\"190px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Motorola DynaTAC.jpg|In 1984, the Motorola DynaTAC 8000X becomes the first commercially available '''[[mobile phone]]''' model\nFile:PIC_0011_Samsung_SF100.jpg|During the decade the standardization of Group 3 facsimile terminals by the International Telecommunication Union contributed to the significant spread of the '''[[fax]]''' machine.\nFile:Betavhs2.jpg|[[VHS]] won out over the competing '''[[Betamax]]''' standard, becoming the leading standard in home video systems\nFile:Hayes 300 Baud Smartmodem 02.jpg|[[Hayes Microcomputer Products|Hayes]]'s '''Smartmodem'''\n</gallery>\n\n=== Information technology ===\n* During the decade [[Microsoft]] released the operating systems '''[[MS-DOS]]''' (1981), '''[[Windows 1.0]]''' (1985), and '''[[Windows 2.0]]''' (1987).\n* The '''[[CD]]''' - the most basic CD (\"Digital Audio Compact Disc\") was released in October 1982 for distribution and listening to [[digital audio]], and at the time contained up to 74 minutes of music.\n* '''[[TCP/IP]]''': [[ARPANET]] officially changed its main protocol from NCP to [[TCP/IP]] on January 1, 1983 when the new protocols were activated. The TCP/IP protocol will become the dominant communications protocol from then onwards, and would be used as the foundation on which the [[Internet]] would be based.\n* The '''[[GNU Project]]''' (1983). The '''[[Free Software Foundation]]''' (1985).\n* '''[[FidoNet]]''' - In 1984, FidoNet was launched, enabling [[Bulletin board system|BBS]] users to send private messages (e-mails) and public messages (in the forum) between all BBS systems that were connected to the FidoNet network, in addition to sending files to each other. The rise in popularity and availability of the Internet around the world around the mid-1990s eventually contributed to the irrelevance of FidoNet.\n* '''[[World Wide Web]]''' - In 1989, the British computer scientist [[Tim Berners-Lee]] first proposed a project to his employer [[CERN]], based on the concept of [[hypertext]], to facilitate sharing and updating information among researchers. In mid-November 1989 he would develop the first successful communication between a [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP) client and server via the [[internet]]. In the coming years Berners-Lee developed the system which would later became the foundation of the [[World Wide Web]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"190px\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:CD autolev crop new.jpg|The most basic [[CD]] was first introduced in October 1982 for the purpose of distribution and listening to digital audio\nFile:MS-Dos screenshot.png|In 1981, Microsoft introduced the [[MS-DOS]] operating system, which would become the world's most widely used [[operating system]] in the 1980s and first half of the 1990s.\nFile:Tim Berners-Lee.jpg|In 1989, the British computer scientist [[Tim Berners-Lee]] first proposed the [[World Wide Web]], which he would develop in the coming years\n</gallery>\n\n===Space exploration===\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching.jpg|thumb|The [[Space Shuttle Columbia|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'']] seconds after engine ignition, 1981]]\nAmerican interplanetary probes continued in the 1980s, the Voyager duo being the most known. After making a flyby of Jupiter in 1979, they went near Saturn in 1980\u20131981. Voyager 2 reached Uranus in 1986 (just a few days before the ''Challenger'' disaster), and Neptune in 1989 before the probes exited the solar system.\n\nNo American probes were launched to Mars in the 1980s, and the [[Viking program|Viking]] probes, launched there in 1975, completed their operations by 1982. The Soviets launched two Mars probes in 1988, but they failed.\n\nThe arrival of [[Halley's Comet]] in 1986 was met by a series of Soviet, Japanese and [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) probes, namely [[Halley Armada]].\n\nAfter a six-year hiatus, American space flights with astronauts resumed with the launch of the space shuttle Columbia in April 1981. The shuttle program progressed smoothly from there, with three more orbiters entering service in 1983\u20131985. But that all came to an end with the tragic loss of the [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']] ([[STS-51-L]]) on January 28, 1986, taking with it seven astronauts, including Christa McAuliffe, who was to have been the first teacher in space. In full view of the world, a faulty O-ring on the right solid rocket booster allowed hot gases to burn through the external fuel tank and cause it to explode, destroying the shuttle in the process. Extensive efforts were made to improve [[NASA]]'s increasingly careless management practices, and to make the shuttle safer. Flights resumed with the launch of [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] in September 1988.\n\nThe Soviet program with cosmonauts went well during the decade, experiencing only minor setbacks. The [[Salyut 6]] space station, launched in 1977, was replaced by [[Salyut 7]] in 1982. Then came ''[[Mir]]'' in 1986, which ended up operating for more than a decade, and was destined to be the last in the line of Soviet space stations that had begun in 1971. One of the Soviet Union's last \"superprojects\" was the [[Buran (spacecraft)|''Buran'' space shuttle]]; it was only used once, in 1988.\n\n===Automobiles===\nThe American auto industry began the 1980s in a thoroughly grim situation, faced with poor quality control, rising import competition, and a severe economic downturn.<ref>{{cite journal|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,924408-8,00.html |title=Detroit's Uphill Battle |journal=Time |date=1980-09-08 |first=Alexander |last=Taylor |first2=Christopher |last2=Redman |first3=Barrett |last3=Seaman |accessdate=2015-04-18}}</ref> [[Chrysler]] and [[American Motors]] (AMC) were near bankruptcy, and Ford was little better off.<ref>{{cite journal| first=Alexander |last=Taylor |first2=Christopher |last2=Redman |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,922223-2,00.html|title=Detroit's Road Is Still Rocky |journal=Time |date=1980-12-15 |accessdate=2015-04-18}}</ref> Only GM continued with business as usual. But the auto makers recovered with the economy by 1983, and in 1985 auto sales in the United States hit a new record. However, the Japanese were now a major presence, and would begin manufacturing cars in the US to get around tariffs. In 1986, Hyundai became the first Korean auto maker to enter the American market. In the same year, the Yugoslavian-built [[Zastava Koral|Yugo]] was brought to the US, but the car was so small and cheap, that it became the subject of jokes. It was sold up to 1991, when economic sanctions against Yugoslavia forced its withdrawal from the American market.\n\nAs the decade progressed, cars became smaller and more efficient in design. In 1983, Ford design teams began to incorporate aerodynamic styling to decrease drag while in motion. The Thunderbird was one of the first cars to receive these design changes. In 1985, Ford released the Taurus with a design that was revolutionary among domestic mass market automobiles.\n\nGeneral Motors began suffering significant losses in the late 1980s, partially the result of chairman Roger Smith's restructuring attempts, and partially because of increasingly dated cars. An example were customers who increasingly purchased European luxury cars rather than Cadillacs. In 1985, GM started [[Saturn Corporation|Saturn]] (the first new American make since the Edsel), with the goal of producing high-quality import fighters. Production would not begin until 1990.\n\nChrysler introduced its new compact, front-wheel drive [[Chrysler K platform|K-cars]] in 1981. Under the leadership of Lee Iacocca, the company turned a profit again the following year, and by 1983 paid off its government loans. A succession of models using this automobile platform followed. The most significant were the minivans in 1984. These proved a to be popular and they would dominate the van market for more than a decade. In 1987, Chrysler purchased the Italian makes of Lamborghini and Maserati. In the same year, Chrysler bought AMC from Renault laying to rest the last significant independent U.S. automaker, but acquiring the hugely profitable [[Jeep]] line and continuing the [[Eagle (automobile)|Eagle]] brand until the late 1990s.<ref>{{cite news|last=Holusha |first=John |title=Chrysler is Buying American Motors; Cost is $1.5&nbsp;billion |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/10/business/chrysler-is-buying-american-motors-cost-is-1.5-billion.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=1987-03-10 |accessdate=2015-04-18}}</ref>\n\nThe [[DMC DeLorean]] was the brainchild of [[John DeLorean]], a flamboyant former GM executive. Production of the gull-winged sports car began in Northern Ireland in 1981. John DeLorean was arrested in October 1982 in a sting operation where he was attempting to sell cocaine to save his struggling company. He was acquitted of all charges in 1984, but too late for the DeLorean Motor Company, which closed down in 1983. The DeLorean gained renewed fame afterward as the time machine in the [[Back to the Future (series)|''Back to the Future'' film trilogy]].\n\nThe imposition of CAFE fuel-mileage standards in 1979 spelled the end of big-block engines, but performance cars and convertibles reemerged in the 1980s. Turbochargers were widely used to boost the performance of small cars, and technology from [[fuel injection]] began to take over from the widely used application of [[carburetors]] by the late 1980s. Front-wheel drive also became dominant.\n\nThe Eighties marked the decline of European brands in North America by the end of the decade. [[Renault]], [[Citroen]], and [[Peugeot]] ceased importation by the end of the decade. [[Alfa Romeo]] would continue until 1993. [[Fiat Automobiles|Fiat]] also ceased imports to North America in the Eighties.\n\n==Economics==\n* The early 1980s was marked by a severe global [[Early 1980s recession|economic recession]] that affected much of the developed world.\n* Inflation peaked in the U.S. in April 1980 at 14.76% and subsequently fell to a low of 1.10% in December 1986 but then rebounded to 4.65% at the end of the decade. On the other hand, Finland's economy grew by almost the fastest pace in the world, which eventually culminated in the recession of the 1990s Finnish economy. In Finland, the 1980s were called the \"Nousukausi\", or \"economic upswing\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Inflation and CPI Consumer Price Index 1980\u20131989|url=http://inflationdata.com/articles/inflation-cpi-consumer-price-index-1980-1989/|website=InflationData.com|accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref>\n* International debt crisis in developing countries, reliance of these countries on aid from the [[International Monetary Fund]].\n* Revival of [[laissez-faire economics|laissez faire]]/[[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economics in the developed world led by the UK and US governments emphasising reduced government intervention, lower taxes and deregulation of the stock markets associated with an economic revival in the mid- to late '80s.

Economic problems worsened in 1985 by resignation of most officials of the Mexican government after a failed response of emergency aid in the Mexico City earthquake (September 19) just after the 175th anniversary of Independence holiday (September 16). In 1988, [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] won a controversial presidential election amid charges of voter fraud, bribery, corruption and other abuses of power.\n* Enactment of the [[Canada\u2013United States Free Trade Agreement]] in 1989 to further establish a strong economic bond between the two prosperous neighbor countries of North America.\n* In the [[Soviet Union]], the [[Eleventh Five-Year Plan (Soviet Union)|eleventh Five-Year Plan]] was initiated in 1981 during a [[Era of Stagnation|period of economic stagnation]] that began in the late 1970s. The Plan was a near failure, as most of the targets were not met. With the ascent of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] as [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]], the twelfth Five-Year Plan sought to [[Uskoreniye|accelerate]] and [[Perestroika|restructure]] the Soviet economy through reforms to decentralize production and distribution systems.\n* Under the leadership of [[Deng Xiaoping]], China embarked on extensive reforms in the 1980s, opening the country's economy to the West and allowing capitalist enterprises to operate in a [[Socialism with Chinese characteristics|market socialist system]]. The corruption of [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] leadership was met by dissent from students and workers in the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] which were suppressed by the [[People's Liberation Army]].\n* The [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity movement]] began in Poland in 1980, involving workers demanding political liberalization and democracy in Poland. Attempts by the Communist government to prevent the rise the Solidarity movement failed and negotiations between the movement and the government took place. Solidarity would be instrumental in encouraging people in other communist states to demand political reform.\n* The financial world and the stock market were glamorized in a way they had not been since the 1920s, and figures like [[Donald Trump]] and [[Michael Milken]] were widely seen as symbols of the decade.

Jackson's 1982 album ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' became\u2014and currently remains\u2014the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling album of all time]], with sales estimated by various sources as somewhere between 65 and 110 million copies worldwide. His 1987 album ''[[Bad (album)|Bad]]'' sold over 45 million copies and became the first album to have 5 number 1 singles chart on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Jackson had the most number-one singles throughout the decade (9), and spent the most weeks at #1 (27 weeks). His 1987 [[Bad (tour)|Bad World Tour]] grossed over $125 million worldwide, making it the highest grossing world tour by a solo artist during the decade. Jackson earned numerous awards and titles during the 1980s, the most notable of which were a record 8 [[Grammy Award]]s and 8 [[American Music Award]]s in 1984, and the honor of Artist of the Decade by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George H. W. Bush|George H.W.

His breakthrough album [[1999 (Prince album)|''1999'']], released in 1982, produced three top-ten hits and the album itself charted at No 9. on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. His sixth studio album [[Purple Rain (album)|''Purple Rain'']] was an international success, boosting Prince to superstardom and selling over 25 million copies worldwide. The album produced the US No 1. singles, \"[[When Doves Cry]]\" and \"[[Let's Go Crazy]]\" and sold 13 million copies in the United States as of 1996. Prince released an album every year for the rest of the decade, all charting within the Top 10, with the exception of [[Lovesexy]].

After the 1980s electronic instruments were no longer popular in rock but continued to be the main component of mainstream pop.\n\n[[Hard rock]], [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], and [[glam metal]] became some of the most dominant music genres of the decade, peaking with the arrival of such bands as [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]], [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Metallica]], [[Iron Maiden]], [[Bon Jovi]], [[Def Leppard]], [[Poison (American band)|Poison]], [[Europe (band)|Europe]], [[Megadeth]], [[Slayer]], [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], and [[virtuoso]] guitarists such as [[Joe Satriani]] and [[Yngwie Malmsteen]]. The scene also helped 1970s hard rock artists such as [[AC/DC]], [[Heart (band)|Heart]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[Deep Purple]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Van Halen]], [[Kiss (band)|KISS]], [[Ronnie James Dio]], and [[Judas Priest]] reach a new generation of fans.\n\nBy 1989, the [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] scene had evolved, gaining recognition and exhibiting a stronger influence on the music industry. This time period is also considered part of the [[golden age hip hop|golden age]] of hip hop. The [[Beastie Boys]], [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]], [[Run\u2013D.M.C.|Run-D.M.C.]], [[Grandmaster Flash]], the [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five|Furious Five]], [[Boogie Down Productions]], [[N.W.A]], [[LL Cool J]], [[De La Soul]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]], [[EPMD]], [[Eric B. & Rakim]], [[Ice-T]], [[DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince]], [[2 Live Crew]], [[Tone L\u014dc]], [[Biz Markie]], the [[Jungle Brothers]], [[The Sugar Hill Gang]] and others experienced success in this genre.\n\n[[Country music]] catapulted into a new realm of popularity with youth appeal and record-breaking marks. Groundbreaking artists such as [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]], [[Hank Williams, Jr.]], [[Reba McEntire]], [[George Strait]], [[Ricky Skaggs]], [[Janie Fricke]], [[The Judds]], and [[Randy Travis]] achieved multiple platinum and award status, foreshadowing the genre's popularity explosion in the 1990s. Country legends from prior decades, however; such as [[George Jones]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Conway Twitty]], the [[Oak Ridge Boys]], [[Kenny Rogers]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Merle Haggard]], [[Don Williams]], [[Crystal Gayle]], [[Ronnie Milsap]], [[Barbara Mandrell]], and the [[Statler Brothers]]; also continued to score hits throughout the decade.\n\nThe [[techno]] style of electronic dance music emerged in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], during the mid- to late 1980s. The [[house music]] style, another form of electronic dance music, emerged in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], in the early 1980s. It was initially popularized in mid-1980s discoth\u00e8ques catering to the African-American, Latino and gay communities, first in Chicago, then in New York City and Detroit. It eventually reached Europe before becoming infused in mainstream pop and dance music worldwide.\n\n[[Punk rock]] continued to make strides in the musical community. With bands leading the significance of this period such as [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], [[Bad Brains]], [[Minor Threat]], [[Suicidal Tendencies]], [[D.O.A. (band)|D.O.A.]], [[Bad Religion]], [[Minutemen (band)|Minutemen]], [[Social Distortion]], and [[Dead Kennedys]], it gave birth to many subgenres like [[Hardcore punk|hardcore]], which has continued to be moderately successful, giving birth in turn to a few counterculture movements, most notably the [[Straight Edge]] movement which began in the early era of this decade. [[College rock]] caught on in the underground scene of the 1980s in a nationwide movement with a distinct [[DIY ethic|D.I.Y]] approach. Bands like the [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]], [[R.E.M.]], [[The Replacements (band)|The Replacements]], [[Sonic Youth]], [[XTC]], [[The Smiths]], [[H\u00fcsker D\u00fc]], [[The Stone Roses]], [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]] etc. experienced success in this genre.

In the mid 1980s, a wave of British directors, including [[Ridley Scott]], [[Alan Parker]], [[Adrian Lyne]] and [[Tony Scott]] (with the latter directing a number of Don Simpson films) ushered in a new era of blockbusters using the crowd-pleasing skills they had honed in UK television commercials.<ref>{{cite news|first=Delaney|last=Sam|title=Jets, jeans and Hovis|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/aug/24/1|agency=''The Guardian''|date=August 24, 2007|access-date=March 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe '80s also saw the golden age of \"[[teen film|teen flicks]]\" and also spawned the [[Brat Pack (actors)|Brat Pack]] films, many of which were directed by [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]]. Films such as ''[[Class (film)|Class]]'', ''[[The Breakfast Club]]'', ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]'', ''[[Mannequin (1987 film)|Mannequin]]'', ''[[Porky's]]'', ''[[Pretty in Pink]]'', ''[[Sixteen Candles]]'', ''[[St. Elmo's Fire (film)|St. Elmo's Fire]]'', ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'', ''[[Weird Science (film)|Weird Science]]'', and ''[[Valley Girl (1983 film)|Valley Girl]]'' were popular teen comedies of the era and launched the careers of several major celebrities such as: [[Emilio Estevez]], [[Anthony Michael Hall]], [[Forest Whitaker]], [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]], [[Andrew McCarthy]], [[Judd Nelson]], [[Molly Ringwald]], [[Sean Penn]], [[Nicolas Cage]] and [[Michael J Fox]]. Other popular films included ''[[About Last Night...]]'', ''[[Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure]]'', ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'', ''[[Flashdance]]'', ''[[Footloose (1984 film)|Footloose]]'', ''[[Raging Bull]]'' and ''[[St. Elmo's Fire (film)|St. Elmo's Fire]]'' which also launched the careers of high-profile celebrities like [[Demi Moore]], [[Joe Pesci]], [[Keanu Reeves]], [[Kevin Bacon]], [[Rob Lowe]], [[Patrick Swayze]], and [[River Phoenix]].\n\nHorror films were a popular genre during the decade, with several notable horror franchises being born during the 1980s. Among the most popular were the ''[[Child's Play (film series)|Child's Play]]'', ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'', ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'', ''[[Hellraiser (franchise)|Hellraiser]]'', and ''[[Poltergeist (film series)|Poltergeist]]'' franchises. Aside from these films, the concept of the [[B movie|B horror film]] gave rise to a plethora of horror films that went on to earn a cult status. An example of such is the 1981 film ''[[The Evil Dead]]'', ''[[Pink Floyd \u2013 The Wall]]'' marked the directorial debut of [[Sam Raimi]]. Comedy horror films such as ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' and ''[[Gremlins]]'' also gained cult status.\n\nSeveral action film franchises were also launched during the 1980s. The most popular of these were the ''[[Beverly Hills Cop (film series)|Beverly Hills Cop]], [[Die Hard (franchise)|Die Hard]], [[Lethal Weapon (film series)|Lethal Weapon]]'', and ''[[Rambo (film series)|Rambo]]'' franchises. Other action films from the decade which are of notable status include ''[[The Terminator]]'', ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'', and ''[[RoboCop]]''. These films propelled the careers of modern celebrities such as [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Bruce Willis]], [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Mel Gibson]], [[Sylvester Stallone]] and   [[Chuck Norris]] to international recognition. On the other side of the globe, [[Hong Kong action cinema]] was being revolutionized by a new wave of inventive filmmakers that includes [[Jackie Chan]], [[Tsui Hark]], and [[John Woo]].\n\nFive more [[James bond films]] were released, with [[Roger Moore]] continuing in the role in ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'', ''[[Octopussy (film)|Octopussy]]'', and ''[[A View to a Kill (film)|A View To A Kill]]'', before handing over the role to [[Timothy Dalton]] who starred in ''[[The Living Daylights (film)|The Living Daylights]]'' and ''[[Licence to Kill (film)|Licence To Kill]]''.\n\nA significant development in the home media business is the establishment of [[The Criterion Collection]] in 1984, an American company \"dedicated to gathering the greatest films from around the world and publishing them in editions that offer the highest technical quality\". Through their releases, they were able to introduce what is now a standard to home video: [[Letterboxing (filming)|letterboxing]] to retain the original aspect ratio, [[Audio commentary|film commentaries]] and supplements/special features.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Criterion|url=https://www.criterion.com/about_us|website=The Criterion Collection|publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]]|accessdate=26 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author1=Wadham College|title=Frame by Frame|url=https://www.wadham.ox.ac.uk/news/2014/october/frame-by-frame|accessdate=27 February 2016|work=[[Wadham College, Oxford|Wadham College, University of Oxford]]|publisher=Wadham College, University of Oxford|date=28 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nAlthough [[animated feature films]] did not gained mainstream popularity until the mid-1990s due to public preference of TV animation, some imporant films were produced during the decade. Ater leaving [[Disney]] in 1979, [[Don Bluth]] formed [[Sullivan Bluth Studios|his own studio]] and went on direct ''[[The Secret of NIMH]]'', ''[[An American Tail]]'', ''[[The Land Before Time]]'' and ''[[All Dogs Go To Heaven]]''. At the same time, [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|the Disney studio]] wasn't having good times and almost bankrupted after ''[[The Black Cauldron (film)|The Black Cauldron]]'' bombed at the box office. However, in later years, they slowly recovered with the modest success of [[Ron Clements]] and [[John Musker]] directed ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]'' and eventually regained public confidence following the release of  ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]''. Other animated films from the decade also gained notable status: Films based on popular works include ''[[Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown (and Don't Come Back!!)]]'',  ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Mark Twain (1985 film)|The Adventures of Mark Twain]]'', ''[[The Care Bears Movie]]'', ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]'', ''[[The Chipmunk Adventure]]'' and ''[[Daffy Duck's Quackbusters]]''; while original films include ''[[The Last Unicorn (film)|The Last Unicorn]]'', ''[[The Plague Dogs (film)|The Plague Dogs]]'', ''[[Rock & Rule]]'', ''[[Fire and Ice (1983 film)|Fire and Ice]]'', ''[[The Brave Little Toaster]]'' and ''[[Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland]]''.\n\nThe '80s also saw a surge of [[Anime|Japanese anime films]]: [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s ''[[Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (film)|Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind]]'' was extremely successful enough to lead the foundation of [[Studio Ghibli]] which would then produce several successful films of the decade including ''[[Castle in the Sky]]'', ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]'', ''[[Grave of the Fireflies]]'' and ''[[Kiki's Delivery Service]]''. Other well-known anime films of that decade include ''[[Golgo 13: The Professional]]'', ''[[Macross: Do You Remember Love?]]'', ''[[Lensman (1984 film)|Lensman]]'', ''[[Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honneamise]]'', and ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]''. Additionally, the first-ever theatrical animated franchise: [[List of Doraemon films|the Doraemon film series]] (based on the [[Doraemon|anime and manga series of the same name]]) began in 1980 with the release of ''[[Doraemon: Nobita's Dinosaur]]''.\n\n=== Actors / Entertainers ===\n{{Div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Nancy Allen (actress)|Nancy Allen]]\n* [[Kirstie Alley]]\n* [[Harry Anderson]]\n* [[Julie Andrews]]\n* [[Alan Arkin]]\n* [[Rosanna Arquette]]\n* [[Bea Arthur]]\n* [[Dan Aykroyd]]\n* [[Amitabh Bachchan]]\n* [[Alec Baldwin]]\n* [[Kim Basinger]]\n* [[Meredith Baxter]]\n* [[Ned Beatty]]\n* [[Ed Begley Jr.]]\n* [[James Belushi]]\n* [[John Belushi]]\n* [[Tom Berenger]]\n* [[Sandahl Bergman]]\n* [[Michael Biehn]]\n* [[Linda Blair]]\n* [[Lisa Bonet]]\n* [[Ernest Borgnine]]\n* [[Eric Braeden]]\n* [[Jeff Bridges]]\n* [[Matthew Broderick]]\n* [[Pierce Brosnan]]\n* [[Clancy Brown]]\n* [[Delta Burke]]\n* [[Nicolas Cage]]\n* [[Michael Caine]]\n* [[Kirk Cameron]]\n* [[Bruce Campbell]]\n* [[John Candy]]\n* [[David Carradine]]\n* [[Dixie Carter]]\n* [[Jackie Chan]]\n* [[Chevy Chase]]\n* [[John Cleese]]\n* [[Glenn Close]]\n* [[James Coburn]]\n* [[Mindy Cohn]]\n* [[Joan Collins]]\n* [[Maria Conchita Alonso]]\n* [[Sean Connery]]\n* [[Bill Cosby]]\n* [[Kevin Costner]]\n* [[Ronny Cox]]\n* [[Tom Cruise]]\n* [[Billy Crystal]]\n* [[Jamie Lee Curtis]]\n* [[Tony Curtis]]\n* [[Willem Dafoe]]\n* [[William Daniels]]\n* [[Ted Danson]]\n* [[Tony Danza]]\n* [[Robert Davi]]\n* [[Geena Davis]]\n* [[Rae Dawn Chong]]\n* [[Daniel Day-Lewis]]\n* [[Dom DeLuise]]\n* [[Robert De Niro]]\n* [[Bruce Dern]]\n* [[Danny DeVito]]\n* [[Joyce DeWitt]]\n* [[Matt Dillon]]\n* [[Michael Douglas]]\n* [[Richard Dreyfuss]]\n* [[Fred Dryer]]\n* [[Patrick Duffy]]\n* [[Bill Duke]]\n* [[Robert Duvall]]\n* [[Clint Eastwood]]\n* [[Sam Elliott]]\n* [[R.

[[Cable television]] became more accessible and therefore, more popular. By the middle of the decade, almost 70% of the American population had cable television and over 85% were paying for cable services such as [[HBO]] or [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]].<ref>[http://eightiesclub.tripod.com/id13.htm The Politics and Pop Culture of the 1980s] The Eighties Club. Retrieved on 2010-03-08</ref> People who lived in rural areas where cable TV service was not available could still access cable channels through a large (and expensive) [[satellite dish]], which, by the mid-1990s, was phased out in favor of the small rooftop dishes that offer [[DirecTV]] and [[Dish Network]] services.\n\nThe 1980s also saw the debut of [[prime-time television|prime-time]] [[soap opera]]s such as ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', its spin-off ''[[Knots Landing]]'', ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'', ''[[Falcon Crest]]'', ''[[EastEnders]]'' and ''[[Neighbours]]''.\n\nIn 1985, both sitcoms debuted on the same day: ''[[The Golden Girls]]'', starring [[Bea Arthur]], [[Betty White]], [[Rue McClanahan]] and [[Estelle Getty]], where it lasted for 7 seasons, where it was also the first comedy ever to feature 4 older women in the title show, and ''[[227 (TV series)|227]]'', was originally the sitcom vehicle for [[Marla Gibbs]], who previously starred in ''[[The Jeffersons]]'', that also launched [[Jack\u00e9e Harry]]'s career.\n\n1986 was the year that marked the debut of the [[legal drama]], ''[[Matlock (TV series)|Matlock]]'', which was the comeback vehicle for [[Andy Griffith]], as the title character,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/article/2012/07/03/andy-griffith-dies|title=Andy Griffith dies|work=EW.com|date=July 3, 2012 |accessdate=May 7, 2018}}</ref> which also launched the careers of [[Nancy Stafford]], [[Clarence Gilyard Jr.]] and [[Daniel Roebuck]].\n\nTV talk shows expanded in popularity; ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' remained popular into its third decade, and some of the most viewed newer shows were hosted by [[Geraldo (TV series)|Geraldo Rivera]], [[Arsenio Hall]] and [[David Letterman]].<ref>[http://abc80s.com/sunshine80stv.htm An overview on 80s Television] Retrieved on 2010-03-08</ref>\n\nThe 1980s also was prominent for spawning several popular children's cartoons such as ''[[The Smurfs (1981 TV series)|The Smurfs]]'', ''[[ThunderCats (1985 TV series)|ThunderCats]]'', ''[[Voltron (1984 TV series)|Voltron]]'', ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'', ''[[Masters of the Universe]]'', ''[[G.I.

The Islanders also became the second [[NHL]] expansion team after the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] to win the Cup. Since their last Cup win in 1983, they were the third NHL team to win 4 consecutive championships and hold the NHL record for most consecutive playoff series' wins at 19 (stretching from the [[1980 Stanley Cup Playoffs|1980 Playoffs]] to the [[1984 Stanley Cup Finals|1984 Playoffs]]).\n* The [[Edmonton Eskimos]] of the [[Canadian Football League]] win the first three [[Grey Cup]] championships of the decade (having won the last two of the previous decade), adding one more in 1987.\n* The [[1983 Cricket World Cup]] was won by [[India]] while [[1987 Cricket World Cup]] was won by [[Australia]].\n* The [[1984 Winter Olympics]] were held in [[Sarajevo]], [[Yugoslavia]] (now Sarajevo, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]). Yugoslavia became the second communist country to host the [[Olympic Games]], but unlike the Soviet Union in 1980, there were no boycotts of the Games by Western countries.\n* The [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in Los Angeles were boycotted by the Soviet Union and most of the Communist world (China, Romania, and Yugoslavia participated in the games) in retaliation for the boycott of the 1980 Games in Moscow.\n* The [[Jamaica national bobsled team]] received major media attention and stunned the world at the [[1988 Winter Olympics]] in [[Calgary|Calgary, Alberta]], Canada for its unexpected good performance. The events surrounding the Jamaica bobsled team in 1988 would lead to the creation of the [[Disney]] movie ''[[Cool Runnings]]'' five years later.\n* The [[1988 Summer Olympics]] were held in [[Seoul]], South Korea. Attempts to include North Korea in the games were unsuccessful and it boycotted along with six other countries, but with 160 nations participating, it had the highest attendance of any Olympics to date.\n* [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] bans [[Group B]] [[rallying]] after a series of deaths and injuries take place in the 1986 season.\n* Canadian hockey player [[Wayne Gretzky]]'s rise to fame in the NHL coincided with the [[Edmonton Oilers]]' first 4 Stanley Cup championships ([[1984 Stanley Cup Finals|1984]], [[1985 Stanley Cup Finals|1985]], [[1987 Stanley Cup Finals|1987]], and [[1988 Stanley Cup Finals|1988]]) and becoming the second NHL [[dynasty (sports)|dynasty]] team of the 1980s.\n* On August 9, 1988, in what became the biggest trade in NHL history (also known as \"The Trade Of The Century\"), Wayne Gretzky was traded along with teammates [[Marty McSorley]] and [[Mike Krushelnyski]] from Edmonton to the [[Los Angeles Kings]] in exchange for [[Martin G\u00e9linas]], [[Jimmy Carson]], three first round draft picks, and US$15 million cash (approximately $18 million [[Canadian dollar|CAD]] in 1988).\n* American basketball player [[Michael Jordan]] burst onto the scene in the NBA during the 1980s, bringing a surge in popularity for the sport and becoming one of the most beloved sports icons in the United States.\n* On June 8, 1986, the [[Boston Celtics]] defeat the [[Houston Rockets]] in Game 6 of the [[1986 NBA Finals]] to capture a record 16th championship. [[Larry Bird]] is named [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|Finals MVP]].\n* On November 26, 1986, [[Mike Tyson]] became the youngest boxing Heavyweight Champion in history at age 20.\n* On March 31, 1985, the [[WWE|WWF]] presented the first [[WrestleMania]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]] with an attendance of 19,121.\n* On March 29, 1987, [[WrestleMania III]] had a record attendance of 93,173; the largest recorded attendance for a live indoor sporting event in North America until 2010. This also remained the WrestleMania attendance record until [[WrestleMania 32]] at [[AT&T Stadium]] on April 3, 2016, in Arlington, Texas\n* West Germany won the 1980 UEFA championship.\n* Italy won the 1982 FIFA World Cup in Spain.\n* France hosted and won the 1984 UEFA championship.\n* Argentina won the 1986 FIFA World Cup in Mexico.\n* The Netherlands won the 1988 UEFA championship.\n* [[Hawthorn Football Club]] dominated Australian football, reaching seven successive VFL Grand Finals and winning the premiership in 1983, 1986, 1988, and 1989\n* [[Liverpool F.C.]] were the most successful club side of the era, becoming English champions on six occasions (1980, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1986, and 1988) and winning two European Cups (1981, 1984). They also won the FA Cup in 1986, completing the first double in their history, and four consecutive [[League Cup]] titles from 1981 to 1984.\n* Other highly successful club sides of the 1980s include [[Juventus]] (7 major honours won), [[Real Madrid]] (10 major honors won), [[Bayern Munich]] (9 titles won) [[PSV Eindhoven]] (4 times Dutch champions and European Cup winners in 1988), and [[Clube de Regatas do Flamengo|Flamengo]] (4 times Brazilian champions, South American and International Cup winners in 1981).\n* In the [[NFL]], the [[San Francisco 49ers]] became the dynasty of the decade, winning four Super Bowls under the leadership of [[Joe Montana]]; the [[Chicago Bears]] won [[Super Bowl XX]] in January 1986, in which the team has been widely remembered for their [[1985 Chicago Bears season|defense]]; the [[Washington Redskins]] also enjoyed success throughout the decade, winning two of their three Super Bowls under the leadership of head coach [[Joe Gibbs]].\n* [[Magic Johnson]] and [[Larry Bird]] became the two most popular NBA players during the decade while even facing against each other in three [[NBA Finals]] ([[1984 NBA Finals|1984]], [[1985 NBA Finals|1985]], and [[1987 NBA Finals|1987]]) continuing the storied [[Celtics-Lakers rivalry]].\n* [[Major League Baseball]] experienced parity and tense championship moments during the decade as the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] won their first World Series championship in [[1980 World Series|1980]], the [[Kansas City Royals]] win their first World Series championship in dramatic fashion in [[1985 World Series|1985]], the [[New York Mets]] win their second World Series championship in [[1986 World Series|1986]] in dramatic fashion, the [[Minnesota Twins]] win their first World Series in [[1987 World Series|1987]], and both the [[1988 World Series|1988]] and [[1989 World Series]] be remembered as [[Kirk Gibson's 1988 World Series home run]], and the [[Loma Prieta Earthquake]] taking place occurring at 5:04 respectively.\n* [[Ultimate (sport)|Disc ultimate]] league play is introduced to Canada in 1980 by [[Ken Westerfield]] starting the first [[Ultimate Canada#History|disc ultimate league (TUC)]], in Toronto.\n\n=== Sports figures ===\n{{Div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]]\n* [[Marcus Allen]]\n* [[Franco Baresi]]\n* [[Boris Becker]]\n* [[Larry Bird]]\n* [[Wade Boggs]]\n* [[Mike Bossy]]\n* [[George Brett]]\n* [[Maurice Cheeks]]\n* [[Kenny Dalglish]]\n* [[Eric Dickerson]]\n* [[John Elway]]\n* [[Julius Erving]]\n* [[Chris Evert]]\n* [[Dan Fouts]]\n* [[Grant Fuhr]]\n* [[Steffi Graf]]\n* [[Wayne Gretzky]]\n* [[Ruud Gullit]]\n* [[Tony Gwynn]]\n* [[Rickey Henderson]]\n* [[Evander Holyfield]]\n* [[Bo Jackson]]\n* [[Magic Johnson]]\n* [[Michael Jordan]]\n* [[Florence Griffith Joyner]]\n* [[Jackie Joyner-Kersee]]\n* [[Ivan Lendl]]\n* [[Sugar Ray Leonard]]\n* [[Carl Lewis]]\n* [[Gary Lineker]]\n* [[Ronnie Lott]]\n* [[Moses Malone]]\n* [[Diego Maradona]]\n* [[Dan Marino]]\n* [[Lothar Matth\u00e4us]]\n* [[John McEnroe]]\n* [[Kevin McHale]]{{dn|date=April 2020}}\n* [[Mark Messier]]\n* [[Cheryl Miller]]\n* [[Joe Montana]]\n* [[Martina Navratilova]]\n* [[Robert Parish]]\n* [[Walter Payton]]\n* [[Michel Platini]]\n* [[Denis Potvin]]\n* [[Kirby Puckett]]\n* [[Mary Lou Retton]]\n* [[Jerry Rice]]\n* [[Frank Rijkaard]]\n* [[Cal Ripken Jr.]]\n* [[Bryan Robson]]\n* [[Paolo Rossi]]\n* [[Karl-Heinz Rummenigge]]\n* [[Nolan Ryan]]\n* [[Mike Schmidt]]\n* [[Peter Shilton]]\n* [[Mike Singletary]]\n* [[Ozzie Smith]]\n* [[Lawrence Taylor]]\n* [[Isiah Thomas]]\n* [[Bryan Trottier]]\n* [[Mike Tyson]]\n* [[Marco van Basten]]\n* [[Rudi V\u00f6ller]]\n* [[Dominique Wilkins]]\n* [[Kellen Winslow]]\n* [[James Worthy]]\n* [[Dino Zoff]]\n* [[Zico]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Video gaming===\n{{See also|1980s in video gaming}}\n[[File:NES-Console-Set.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) was released in the mid-1980s and became the [[List of best-selling game consoles|best-selling gaming console]] of its time]]\nPopular video games include: ''[[Pac-Man]]'', ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', ''[[Metroid]]'', ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', ''[[Frogger]]'', ''[[Digger (video game)|Digger]]'', ''[[Tetris]]'', and ''[[Golden Axe]]''.\n''[[Pac-Man]]'' (1980) was the first game to achieve widespread popularity in mainstream culture and the first game character to be popular in his own right.\nHandheld [[History of video games#Handheld LCD games|electronic LCD games]] was introduced into the youth market segment.\nThe primary gaming computers of the 1980s emerged in 1982: the [[Commodore 64]] and [[ZX Spectrum]].\n[[Nintendo]] finally decided in 1985 to release its Famicom (released in 1983 in Japan) in the United States under the name [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES). It was bundled with ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' and it suddenly became a success. The NES dominated the American and Japanese market until the rise of the next generation of consoles in the early 1990s, causing some to call this time the ''[[Nintendo era]]''.\n[[Sega]] released its 16-bit console, [[Mega Drive|Mega Drive/Genesis]], in 1988 in Japan and in North America in 1989.\nIn 1989, Nintendo released the [[Game Boy]], a monochrome handheld console.\n{{Clear}}\n\n<gallery widths=\"190\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Donkey Kong arcade - zapwizard 34102189 (cropped).jpg|The popular 1980s arcade game ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]''\nFile:Game_%26_Watch_WS-_Snoopy_Tennis.jpg|[[Game & Watch]] was the popular mobile game during the decade until it was replaced in the early 1990s with more advanced [[Game Boy]].\nFile:PacmanUserbox.gif|The game ''[[Pac-Man]]'' (1980) became immensely popular and an icon of 1980s popular culture\n</gallery>\n\n===Fashion===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2016}}\nThe beginning of the decade saw the continuation of the clothing styles of the [[1970s in fashion|late 1970s]] and evolved into [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] fashion by the end. However, it had a lot of changes considering that, this fashion became more and more extravagant during the 80s. The 80s included things like teased hair, ripped jeans, neon clothing and lots of colours and different designs which at first weren't accepted for a lot of people.\n\nSignificant hairstyle trends of the 1980s include the [[Perm (hairstyle)|perm]], the [[Mullet (haircut)|mullet]], the [[Jheri curl]], the [[hi-top fade]], and [[big hair]].\n\nSignificant clothing trends of the 1980s include [[Shoulder pads (fashion)#1980s|shoulder pads]], [[Denim|jean jackets]], [[leather]] pants, [[aviator jacket]]s, [[jumpsuit]]s, [[Members Only (fashion brand)|Members Only jackets]], [[Slim-fit pants#The 1980s|skin-tight acid-washed jeans]], Izod and \"Preppy\" polo shirts, [[leggings]] and [[leg warmer]]s (popularized in the film ''[[Flashdance]]''), off-the-shoulder shirts, and cut sweatshirts (again, popularized in the film ''[[Flashdance]]''). [[Miniskirt]]s made a dramatic comeback in the mid-1980s after a ten-year absence. Makeup on the 1980s was aggressive, shining and colorful. They gave big attention to their lips, eyebrows and cheeks. They used a lot of [[Rouge (cosmetics)|blush]] and a big [[Eye liner|eyeliner]] was always necessary.\n\nAdditional significant trends of the 1980s include [[headband]]s, [[Ray-Ban Aviator]] sunglasses (popularized in the film ''[[Top Gun]]''), [[Ray-Ban Wayfarer|Ray-Ban Wayfarer sunglasses]] (popularized in the films ''[[Risky Business]]'' and ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' and the TV series ''[[Miami Vice]]''), [[Swatch#A fashion statement|Swatch watches]], and the [[Rubik's Cube]] (became a popular fad throughout the decade).

It is located in a region to the east of the [[Lake Neusiedl]] (German: Neusiedlersee; Hungarian: Fert\u0151 t\u00f3) which is named the ''Seewinkel'' (lake corner).\n\n==Geography==\nIllmitz is in the Neusiedler See-Seewinkel National Park on the eastern shore of Lake Neusiedl. The town is at an elevation of 117 meters above sea level. Nearby, an area {{convert|114|m|0|abbr=on}} above sea level is the lowest elevation of Austria.  Characteristic of the area are wide open plains and salt marsh flora, with many small salt lakes around.

It is located in a region to the east of the [[Lake Neusiedl]] (German: Neusiedlersee; Hungarian: Fert\u0151 t\u00f3) which is named the ''Seewinkel'' (lake corner).\n\n==Geography==\nIllmitz is in the Neusiedler See-Seewinkel National Park on the eastern shore of Lake Neusiedl. The town is at an elevation of 117 meters above sea level. Nearby, an area {{convert|114|m|0|abbr=on}} above sea level is the lowest elevation of Austria.  Characteristic of the area are wide open plains and salt marsh flora, with many small salt lakes around. The Lange Lacke (Long Lake) is the largest of about forty such lakes nearby.\n\n==History==\nIn 1897, the [[Austrian Empire]] was dissolved, and [[Austria-Hungary]] was formed, with separate governments in Vienna and Budapest.\nAfter the [[First World War]], [[Burgenland]] was named Deutsch-Westungarn (German-West Hungary) in the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|1919 Treaty of St. Germain]] and the [[Treaty of Trianon]] and was awarded to Austria in 1919.
