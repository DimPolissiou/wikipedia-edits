The club play in the [[Albanian Superliga]], which is the top tier of football in the country.\n\nFounded in 1923, the club is one of the oldest in Albania, and it is also one of the most successful clubs, having won one [[Albanian Superliga]] title in 1991 four [[Albanian Cup]]s and two [[Albanian Supercup]]s. Flamurtari is also known for their European runs in the 1980s, where they famously reached the last sixteen in the [[1987\u201388 UEFA Cup]], where they beat Spanish giants [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in [[Vlor\u00eb]] but lost on aggregate.\n\n==History==\n===Foundation===\nKS Flamurtari Vlor\u00eb were founded on 23 March 1923 as ''Shoqeria Sportive Vlor\u00eb'' with Milto Kor\u00e7ari as the club's first ever President, while Malo Ismaili held the role of the secretary and Faslli Zoga that of the financier. The club was created to make sports and especially football more organized and more popular. Its financial needs were covered by donations from the members or from different activities organized in the city of [[Vlor\u00eb]]. Shoqeria Sportive played their first football match against Shoq\u00ebria Sportive Jeronim de Rada, a local team created from students from Vlor\u00eb. The match ended in a 2\u20132 draw. The goals for Shoqeria Sportive were scored by Adem Gavani and Hazbi Tepelena. During the 1920s the club played several friendlies with other Albanian and foreign teams. Interesting were the matches against Crnogorac Cetinje and the football team of the Livorno Naval Institute which the Red and Black Fleet both won 1\u20130 and 3\u20132 respectively. Shoqeria Sportive Vlor\u00eb were a founder member of the [[Albanian Football Association]] and participated in the first championship. Its first official match was against [[KF Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb|Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb]] in Vlor\u00eb and ended with a 2\u20130 win. The team's first captain in an official match was Jani Kosta. In the first championship Shoqeria Sportive finished bottom of the table with two wins (vs. Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb at home, 2\u20130, and vs. [[KF Elbasani|Urani Elbasan]] away, 2\u20131), two draws (vs. Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb away, 0\u20130, and vs. [[KS Vllaznia Shkod\u00ebr|Bashkimi Shkodran]] at home, 1\u20131) and six losses.\n\n===World War II===\nIn the [[1931 Albanian Superliga|1931]] championship Shoqeria Sportive played in [[1931 Albanian Superliga#Group A|Group A]] against [[KF Tirana|Tirana]] and [[KS Vllaznia Shkod\u00ebr|Bashkimi Shkodran]] collecting a win at home against Bashkimi Shkodran and three losses, with a negative goal difference of 4\u20139. Finishing last of the table meant that the team was relegated to the [[Albanian First Division|Kategoria e Dyte]]. Shoqeria Sportive was drawn to play for the next season in [[1932 Albanian First Division#Group C|Group C]] of the ''Kategoria e Dyte'' against [[SK P\u00ebrmeti|Leka i Madh Permet]], Narta and [[KS Luft\u00ebtari Gjirokast\u00ebr|Shqiponja Gjirokast\u00ebr]]. The championship ended with success as the team was crowned champions of Group C and thus qualified for the play-off final against the Group B champion, [[KS Besa Kavaj\u00eb|Sportklub Kavaj\u00eb]]. The one-legged tie ended 3\u20131 in favour of Sportklub Kavaj\u00eb, which meant that Shoqeria Sportive remained for another year in the Second Division. In the next championship [[KS Delvina|Nimet Abazi Delvin\u00eb]] and [[SK Himar\u00eb|Vet\u00ebtima Himar\u00eb]] entered the competition, while Sportklub Narta withdrew. The season proved once again the superiority of the Red and Black team against their Second Division opponents, by finishing once again top of the Group C and securing promotion. In the two-legged final against [[KF Elbasani|Sportklub Elbasan]], which determined the winner of the Second Division, Shoqeria Sportive lost 4\u20133 on aggregate, thus ending the season as runners-up.\n\nThe [[1934 Albanian Superliga|1934]] started with big problems for the team and ended in the worst ways possible, with the ''Kuqezinjte'' drawing one and losing the rest of their matches, closing with a \u221232 goal difference. A total revolution was needed and it came in 1935, when President of the club was chosen Kristaq Strati. He quickly organised the staff and made affiliations with the local amateur teams in Vlore, thus securing young talented players. The team changed the way of playing focusing more on technique and speed and creating its own style of play thanks to the job done by an early activist of the team, Besim Qorri. To complete the revolution on the team, the Board decided to change the team's name from ''Shoq\u00ebria Sportive Vlor\u00eb'' to ''Shoqata Sportive Ismail Qemali''. The next season proved to be more positive and Sh.S. Ismail Qemali finished seventh out of eight teams, but this time with three wins, three draws and eight losses with e goal difference of \u221221 (GF 14&nbsp;\u2013 GA 35). Even though the team had some great results during the season, the most memorable being the 0\u20132 away win against [[KF Elbasani|Bashkimi Elbasanas]], it still didn't avoid a record 11\u20130 defeat against rivals [[KF Tirana|Tirana]]. The [[1937 Albanian Superliga|1937 championship]] was almost the same with the previous season with the team finishing 9th out of ten teams, leaving behind only [[FK Tomori Berat|Tomori Berat]] thanks to a better goal difference.\n\nOn 7 April 1939, Albania was invaded by [[Italy]] and became an Italian protectorate. However, the invaders were careful to keep football going and thus the [[1939 Albanian Superliga|1939]] championship started on July 1, 1939. Eight teams were separated in groups of four and played in a knock-out system with two-legged matches to qualify to the semi-finals. ''Sh.S. Ismail Qemali'' was drawn to play against [[KS Teuta Durr\u00ebs|Teuta]]. The first match was played in Kavaj\u00eb on July 2 and ended in a 1\u20131 draw. The second was played in the ''Shallvare'' Ground in [[Tiran\u00eb]] on 6 August 1939 and ended 3\u20132 in favour of Teuta. This match was one of the earliest football matches to be transmitted on [[Radio Tirana]], by Albanian journalist Anton Mazreku. After the end of the game, ''Sh.S. Ismail Qemali'' appealed against the result, pretending that the last minutes of the game were played on total darkness and the result was affected by the lack of lighting. The Technical Commission decided that the game would be replayed. On 10 September 1939, once again at the ''Shallvare'' Ground the two teams tried to eliminate each other but [[KS Teuta Durr\u00ebs|Teuta]] was superior and won the match by three to one. This meant Sh.S. Ismail Qemali was knocked out of the tournament.\n\n===1945\u20131980===\nIn November 1944, Shoqata Sportive Ismail Qemali was re-opened. The championship began on 16 September 1945 and the club was playing against [[KS Vllaznia Shkod\u00ebr|Vllaznia]]. SH.S. Ismail Qemali lost 1\u20130. The 1945 season saw the team end in fourth place in a 6 team league. The next championship would be better for The Fleet. On 22 June 1946, the club renamed itself ''Klubi Sportiv Flamurtari Vlor\u00eb''. The 1946 season saw Flamurtari going to the championship final after winning First Division Group B. The final was played in two legs, one in [[Vlor\u00eb]] and one in [[Shkod\u00ebr]]. Flamurtari lost both matches with an aggregated score of 5\u20130. In 1948, Flamurtari played once again in the final, still losing to [[FK Partizani Tirana|Partizani Tirana]], 6\u20132 in [[Qemal Stafa]]. In 1951 the club changed its name to ''Puna Vlor\u00eb'', but in 1958 the club used once again the name ''Flamurtari''. In 1954 Flamurtari participated in the Spartak Cup and won the competition after beating [[KS Vllaznia Shkod\u00ebr|Vllaznia]] 6\u20130 and [[KS Teuta]] and [[KS Pogradeci|Ylli i Kuq Pogradec]] 2\u20130. After reaching twice the championship final, in 1960 made it to the [[Albanian Cup]] final. In the first round playing against [[KS Pogradeci|Ylli i Kuq Pogradec]] and beating them both at home and away matches. In the second round Flamurtari would play against [[Besa Kavaj\u00eb]]. The teams drew both matches and had to go on extra time. After 90 minutes played in [[Kavaje]] and 135 minutes played in [[Vlor\u00eb]] the two teams were still equal. Flamurtari passed the second round thanks to the corners rule: the team that had more corners would qualify. These were 8 to 5 for Flamurtari. In the third round Flamurtari played against [[KF Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb|Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb]]. The first match in [[Vlor\u00eb]] ended in a 3\u20130 win for the home side. In [[Korce]], in the 2nd leg match, [[KF Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb|Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb]] were leading 3\u20130 in half-time. In the second half Flamurtari made one of the greatest comebacks in the history of [[Football in Albania|Albanian football]] winning 4\u20133 in the end of the 90 minutes. In the final the team played against [[KS Dinamo Tirana|Dinamo Tirana]] and they lost 1\u20130 after a hard-fought match. The next years were almost same for the team, placed always in mid-table.\n\n===Golden years===\nIn the 1980s Flamurtari regained their former status as one of the big names in [[Football in Albania|Albanian football]]. Flamurtari finished in 8th place in the 1980\u201381 season, but in the following season rose to second, runners-up to [[SK Tirana]]. During the season Flamurtari remained unbeaten in all matches at home in all competitions. In 1981 Flamurtari would participate for the first time in an international cup, the [[Balkans Cup]]. They played [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]] but they lost 3\u20132 in the [[Olympic Stadium (Athens)|Olympic Stadium]] of [[Athens]]. They finished second in their group with two wins and two losses, achieving 7\u20138 goals in the process. In 1983\u201384 Flamurtari once again reached the Albanian Cup final but lost to Tirana. In the season after, Flamurtari won the Albanian Cup. They defeated [[KF Partizani Tirana|KF Partizani]] and thus claimed their first ever professional trophy.\n\nIn 1985\u201386, Flamurtari finished second in the championship losing the trophy only by goal difference to [[KS Dinamo Tirana|Dinamo Tirana]]. Finishing second in the championship, Flamurtari would play in the [[UEFA Cup]]. They were drawn against [[FC Barcelona]]. Flamurtari was eliminated after two draws (1\u20131 in [[Vlor\u00eb]], 0\u20130 in [[Barcelona]]) thanks to the away goal rule. Flamurtari showed their strength by drawing the first match in Barcelona and taking the lead in the 26th minute in Vlor\u00eb, but FC Barcelona scored a late away goal to deny the Fleet's triumph. In that season Flamurtari managed once again to finish in 2nd place and to reach the [[Albanian Cup]] final losing on aggregate, 4\u20133, to [[KS Vllaznia Shkod\u00ebr|Vllaznia]].\n\nAfter a perfect season they gained the right to play for the second consecutive year in the [[UEFA Cup]]. In the first round they had to play against [[Partizan Belgrade]]. After a 2\u20130 win in Vlor\u00eb, a result of a great Rrapo Taho and an own goal, Flamurtari were playing at [[Stadion Partizana|Narodna Armija Stadium]] on 30 September 1987. [[Partizan Belgrade|Partizan]] were leading 2\u20130 until the 76th minute when [[Sokol Kushta]] scored the goal that took Flamurtari in the next round.\n\nIn the second round Flamurtari were drawn against [[FC Erzgebirge Aue|Wismut Aue]]. In the first game in [[Aue]], Flamurtari lost 0\u20131 being denied many times by keeper Weisflog, however in the second leg there was nothing to do for Aue as Flamurtari defeated them, 2\u20130.\n\nIn the third round Flamurtari were drawn once again against [[FC Barcelona]]. First leg was played at [[Camp Nou]] in front of 35,000 spectators on 25 November. Flamurtari scored in the first half and the players went to the first half break with a score Barcelona-Flamurtari 0\u20131.\nHowever, in the second half Barcelona turned the situation in favour and won with scoreline 4\u20131. Flamurtari narrowly won the second leg, 1\u20130, which wasn't enough to secure the next round and was therefore eliminated from [[UEFA Cup]] after six played matches.\n\nIn the same season Flamurtari went all the way to win the [[Albanian Cup]], after beating [[KF Partizani Tirana|KF Partizani]], 1\u20130, and securing their second cup title. In 1989 Flamurtari played in the [[Cup Winners Cup]] against [[Lech Pozna\u0144]]. After two games Flamurtari was eliminated by losing both home and away matches, 4\u20132 on aggregate. In the [[Albanian Superliga|Kategoria Superiore]] the team finished in the third place. Just a year after Flamurtari lifted for the first time in their history the [[Albanian Superliga|Kategoria Superiore]] title. After some stunning results during the season (including beating runners-up Partizani 3\u20130 and third-place [[KS Vllaznia Shkod\u00ebr|Vllaznia]] 5\u20132), they won the championship with a six-point lead. In the same year they would win also the [[Albanian Supercup]].\n\n===The 1990s===\nAfter the fall of communism, Flamurtari had difficult moments. Many players left the club and went to play abroad. In the 1991\u201392 season the club started the championship with \u22126 points because of financial irregularities. Flamurtari finished the [[Albanian Superliga|Kategoria e Pare]] in sixth place. In the next season the club faced a huge crisis finishing the season 13th out of 16 teams. But the team improved a lot and many new players from the Youth Academy were brought in. The 1993\u201394 season saw Flamurtari finishing 2nd and making [[Stadiumi Flamurtari]] a fortress, winning nine and drawing four out of 13 matches played home, but away from home the team had some horrible results culminating with a 5\u20130 away defeat to [[KF La\u00e7i]]. The next two seasons Flamurtari would finish in fourth place. The 1996\u201397 would be the best season for Flamurtari after the fall of communism. The team had a great start in the season with eight wins in the first nine games. Finishing the 1st phase of the championship in the first place, Flamurtari started the second phase while [[Albania]] was suffering the 1997 riots. Flamurtari was leading until the week the championship was suspended and the Albanian Football Association decided to play all games after in [[Tirana]], something Flamurtari could not afford because of the danger. So, the Albanian Football Association decided that the championship would go to [[KF Tirana]] while Flamurtari finished in third place. The next seasons would be the worst for the team in the last 30 years with the team having its best placement in the 1998\u201399 season finishing 11th in a 16 team league.\n\n==Supporters==\nFlamurtari Vlor\u00eb fans are considered as the most passionate in [[Albania]]. They are, also, the vast majority of all Albania, with at least 20% of all Albanians. This is related with the fact that there has not been other football team in [[Vlor\u00eb]]. Usually, as mentioned in Petraq Hanxhari's book \"{{nowrap|{{lang|sq|Per ty, Flamurtar! (For you, Flamurtar!)}}}}\" from Monday to Thursday the fans used to talk in every pub about the team's last game and condition of the players. On Thursday, after the team's usual test match with any local side, the fans would talk about the next game. But nowadays, the support for Flamurtari has been going down. Even though the ticket sales and the number of season-ticket holders has increased rapidly since 1999 (the lowest average attendance in the entire Flamurtari's history), there are much fewer in comparison with the Communist era. The two fan clubs supporting Flamurtari are \"{{nowrap|{{lang|sq|Dragonjte Kuqezi (Red and Black Dragons)}}}}\" and \"{{nowrap|{{lang|sq|Flota Kuqezi (The Red and Black Fleet)}}}}\". The latter usually stay in the East Stand, commonly known as \"Tribuna C\".\n\n==Club rivalries==\nFlamurtari Vlor\u00eb's main rival is [[KF Tirana|Tirana]]. During the 1975s both clubs used to play the most beautiful football in [[Albania]] and the matches between them were the most attended from the supporters. The relations between the two clubs in and out of field were rude and supporters usually have had troubles and violence. Other rivals include the capital teams: [[KS Dinamo Tirana|Dinamo Tirana]] and [[FK Partizani Tirana|Partizani Tirana]]. The rivalry with the capital teams comes from the 1980s famous matches between the clubs and the fact that [[Vlor\u00eb]] was the first capital of Albania and later capital became [[Tirana]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}. There is a lesser rivalry with [[KS Apolonia Fier|Apolonia Fier]] and [[KS Teuta|Teuta]]. The matches against Teuta are called the \"coastal derbies\". At years 2011\u201313, Flamurtari Vlor\u00eb had some troubles against [[KF Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb|Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb]] because of fan's crash of each team but now everything it's OK.\n\n==Stadium==\n{{main|Flamurtari Stadium}}\n[[File:MainStandFlamurtariStadium.JPG|The main stand at the [[Flamurtari Stadium]]|thumb|250px|right]]\nBefore the construction of the stadium, the club played their home games on a field known as Varri i Halimit, which translates to Halimi's Tomb. The field was located near Uji i Ftoht\u00eb, which is where the club's training ground is located. The stadium was built in 1961 with an initial capacity of 6,500, and was expanded to 11,000 in 1975 following reconstruction. During the club's golden era the stadium would attract crowds of up to 15,000 spectators and in 1987 when the club faced [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in the [[UEFA Cup 1987\u201388|UEFA Cup]] there was a crowd of 18,500, making it the ground's record attendance. Between 2004 and 2012 the ground was under recurring development with the aid of the [[Albanian Football Association]] which saw the ground converted into an [[all-seater stadium]] with a capacity of 8,500. In addition to the construction of the stands and the installation of seats, a new parking lot was built and floodlights were installed for the first time.\n\n==Crest and colours==\n===Badges===\n[[File:Old Flamurtari.PNG|thumb|200px|right|Flamurtari's first crest.]]\nThe club's traditional colours are red and black, after the [[Albanian flag]] which was used by [[Ismail Qemali]] to declare [[Albania]]'s independence in [[Vlor\u00eb]] on 28 November 1912. When the club was founded, it was agreed that the colours of the club would match those of the flag, as it had a played a significant role in the city's history. Flamurtari's first crest was designed in 1930 ahead of the club's first competitive match in the inaugural [[Albanian Superliga|Albanian Football Championship]], and it was designed to resemble the Vlor\u00eb Municipality [[coat of arms]]. Following the [[World War II|Second World War]] the club changed its crest to the shape of a shield, with the initial F in black in the middle of the shield on a red background. In the 1980s the club's crest changed once again but the shape and style still remained, but the club still placed the initial F on the football kits rather than the full crest until 2000. On 3 August 2015 the club announced that the crest would be changed ahead of the 2015\u201316 campaign as part of rebranding strategy,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportekspres.com/flamurtari-ndryshon-stemen/|title=Flamurtari ndryshon stemen|trans-title=Flamurtari changes the crest|language=Albanian|publisher=[[Sport Ekspres]]|date=3 August 2015}}</ref> but they faced immediate pressure from fans as well as the local municipality who were unhappy at both the decision to change the crest and the new design.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.botasot.info/sporti/436518/tifozeve-nuk-iu-pelqen-logo-e-re-e-flamurtarit/|title=Tifoz\u00ebve nuk iu p\u00eblqen logo e re e Flamurtarit|trans-title=Fans do not like Flamurtari's new logo|language=Albanian|publisher=[[Bota Sot]]|date=4 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.panorama.com.al/sport/flamurtari-nderron-logon-bashkia-e-jashteligjshme/|title=Flamurtari nd\u00ebrron logon, Bashkia: E jasht\u00ebligjshme|trans-title=Flamurtari switches the logo, Municipality: Outlaw|language=Albanian|publisher=[[Panorama Sport]]|date=5 August 2015}}</ref> The shield shape was replaced by a circle with an F and half of a double headed eagle, as found on the Albanian flag.\n\n===Kits===\n[[File:Flamurtari Kit 1987-1988.PNG|thumb|200px|left|Flamurtari kits during 1987\u201388 season.]]\nA photograph of the first ever official championship game, taken in April 6, 1930, shows the players wearing a white jersey with a thick black horizontal stripe at the chest, black shorts and black socks. This design was common in [[England]] where post office worker and Flamurtari's president, Milto Korcari, ordered them from. Later, in 1937, the team adopted the vertical stripes and started playing in a red jersey with thin vertical black stripes, black shorts and black socks. In the first years of the team's history the kits featured even the team's emblem while later this was replaced with a golden \"F\" sewn in the middle of the chest.\n\nAfter [[World War II]], the team started using red kits, white shorts and red socks. In different championships the team used black shorts instead of white, similar to the design of the [[Albania national football team|Albanian national football team]]. The away kit was all white. This proved to be a popular design with the fans because it reminded them of the national team. In the 1960s however the primary kit was changed again and a new one was introduced. The new kit was white with three vertical stripes in the center (Red&nbsp;\u2013 Black&nbsp;\u2013 Red), black shorts and black socks. The red kit which earlier had been used as a home kit was now used as an away kit for the first team but it remained as a home kit for the youth team. In 1975 the club decided to reverse once again the kits and the red kit with white shorts and red socks became again the home kit. Away the team used its traditional white kit with the three central vertical stripes.\n\n1981 marked the start of a new era at the club. Apart from a new promising generation of footballers blooming from the youth setup and great results on the pitch, a new kit was introduced which remains until today, with minor changes, the club's home kit. The kit was similar to the one used in the late 1930s, red with thin vertical black stripes, red shorts and red socks while the away kit was still the same. The kit proved to be popular with the fans, primarily because of the colours, which are the Albanian [[national colours]], but also with the great achievements the team reached in this period.\n\nOver the years the home kit has not had major changes and the design has remained almost the same, with the change being on the primar colour of the team, sometimes red and sometimes black, and in the colour of the shorts and socks which have changed from red to black. The away kit has been for many years the same with the club using an all-white in only five seasons since 1981.\n\nA new third kit was introduced for the first time in 2005 to celebrate the team winning the [[Albanian First Division]] title. It was all red with red shirts, red shorts and red socks. The kit was used rarely and was dropped for the next season. In 2007 the numbers on the back were of golden colour for the first time in the club's history as the colour mainly used has been white. For the [[2011\u201312 Albanian Superliga]] the team used an outfit based mostly on black. The kit featured a black chevron and red and black stripes below it, black shorts and black socks. The away kit remained the traditional away kit.\n\nFor the [[2012\u201313 Albanian Superliga]]. Flamurtari will use a [[Legea]] design based primarily on red with black thick stripes, black shorts and black socks, while the club decided to drop the traditional away kit in favour of an all-white one.\n\n===Kit evolution===\n{|\n|{{Football kit box |align= left| pattern_la =_redborder |pattern_b = _blackstripes6 | pattern_ra = _redborder | leftarm =000000  | body = FF0000 | rightarm = 000000 | shorts = 000000 | socks = 000000 | title = 1937\u201345}}\n|{{Football kit box |align= left| pattern_la = _blackborder | pattern_ra = _blackborder | leftarm =FF0000  | body = FF0000 | rightarm = FF0000 | shorts = FFFFFF | socks = FF0000 | title = 1946\u201361, 1975\u201381}}\n|{{Football kit box |align= left| pattern_la =  | pattern_b =_vertical_redblackred_band | pattern_ra =  | leftarm =FFFFFF  | body = FFFFFF | rightarm = FFFFFF | shorts = 000000 | socks = 000000 | title = 1961\u201375}}\n|{{Football kit box |align= left| pattern_la =_redborder |pattern_b = _blackstripes6 | pattern_ra = _redborder | leftarm =FF0000  | body = FF0000 | rightarm = FF0000 | shorts = FF0000 | socks = FF0000 | title = 1975\u201390}}\n|{{Football kit box |align= left| pattern_la = |pattern_b = _blackredstripes2 | pattern_ra =  | leftarm =000000  | body = 000000 | rightarm = 000000 | shorts = 000000 | socks = 000000 | title = Late 90s\u2013present}}\n|}\n\n===Shirt sponsors===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Sponsor Type\n!Name\n|-\n|Main sponsor\n|{{flagicon|ALB}} [[Vlor\u00eb|Municipality of Vlor\u00eb]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Secondary sponsors\n|{{flagicon|ALB}} [[Air Albania]]\n|-\n|{{flagicon|TUR}} TRK\n|-\n|Official clothing provider\n|{{flagicon|ITA}} [[Kappa (brand)|Kappa]]\n|}\n\n==Honours==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100% style=\"text-align: center;font-size:100%;\"\n|+Flamurtari Vlor\u00eb honours\n!scope=col|Type\n!scope=col|Competition\n!scope=col|Titles\n!scope=col|Seasons/Years\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|'''Domestic'''\n!scope=col|[[Albanian Cup]]\n|align=\"center\"|'''4'''\n|[[1984\u201385 Albanian Cup|1984\u201385]], [[1987\u201388 Albanian Cup|1987\u201388]], [[2008\u201309 Albanian Cup|2008\u201309]], [[2013\u201314 Albanian Cup|2013\u201314]]\n|-\n!scope=col|[[Albanian Supercup]]\n|align=\"center\"|'''2'''\n|[[1990 Albanian Supercup|1990]], [[1991 Albanian Supercup|1991]]\n|-\n!scope=col|[[Albanian Superliga]]\n|align=\"center\"|'''1'''\n|[[1990\u201391 Albanian Superliga|1990\u201391]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|'''Minor'''\n!scope=col|[[Bashkimi (Democratic Front newspaper)|Bashkimi]] Cup of Journal\n|align=\"center\"|'''3'''\n|1962, 1963, 1987\n|-\n!scope=col|[[Trade Unions of Albania]] Cup\n|rowspan=\"3\"|'''1'''\n|1948\n|-\n!scope=col|[[Party of Labour of Albania]] Cup\n|1976\n|-\n!scope=col|Birra Norga Trophy\n|2007\n|}\n\n==Players==\n===Current squad===\n{{updated|7 January 2020}}\n<!----------------------------- READ THIS NOTICE FIRST BEFORE EDITING ----------------------------------\n \u2013 Do NOT add new players before their signing is officially announced by the club through their website, including medical and signing the contract.

the late 1980s, being one of the most successful Albanian team in the history of European Cups. In [[1986\u201387 UEFA Cup]] season they played against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]. The Spanish giants managed to knock them out only with the help of a late away goal as 1\u20131 in Vlor\u00eb and 0\u20130 in Barcelona. In the [[1987\u201388 UEFA Cup|next season]], Flamurtari managed to knock-out [[FK Partizan|Partizan]] as 2\u20130 in Vlor\u00eb and 1\u20132 in Belgrade and [[FC Erzgebirge Aue|Wismut Aue]] as 0\u20131 in Aue and 2\u20130 in Vlor\u00eb before losing again to [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] as 1\u20134 in Barcelona and 1\u20130 in Vlor\u00eb. In the [[2009\u201310 UEFA Europa League]] campaign they faced [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] from the [[Scottish Premier League]]. The team put in a strong performance despite playing against technically gifted opponents to record a 1\u20130 home victory. However, despite going to Scotland with confidence boosted, they were heavily and deservedly beaten 8\u20131.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Season\n!Competition\n!Round\n!Opponent\n!Home\n!Away\n|-\n|[[1985\u201386 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|1985\u201386]]\n|[[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]]\n|rowspan=\"3\"|1R\n|align=\"left\"|{{flagicon|FIN}} [[Helsingin Jalkapalloklubi|HJK Helsinki]]\n|1\u20132\n|2\u20133\n|-\n|[[1986\u201387 UEFA Cup|1986\u201387]]\n|rowspan=\"4\"|[[UEFA Cup]]\n|align=\"left\"|{{flagicon|ESP}} [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]\n|1\u20131\n|0\u20130\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|[[1987\u201388 UEFA Cup|1987\u201388]]\n|align=\"left\"|{{flagicon|YUG}} [[FK Partizan|Partizan]]\n|2\u20130\n|1\u20132\n|-\n|2R\n|align=\"left\"|{{flagicon|DDR}} [[FC Erzgebirge Aue|Wismut Aue]]\n|2\u20130\n|0\u20131\n|-\n|1/16\n|align=\"left\"|{{flagicon|ESP}} [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]\n|1\u20130\n|1\u20134\n|-\n|[[1988\u201389 European Cup Winners' Cup|1988\u201389]]\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]]\n|rowspan=\"3\"|1R\n|align=\"left\"|{{flagicon|POL}} [[Lech Poznan]]\n|2\u20133\n|0\u20131\n|-\n|[[1990\u201391 European Cup Winners' Cup|1990\u201391]]\n|align=\"left\"|{{flagicon|GRE}} [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]]\n|0\u20132\n|1\u20133\n|-\n|[[1991\u201392 European Cup|1991\u201392]]\n|[[UEFA European Cup]]\n|align=\"left\"|{{flagicon|SWE}} [[IFK G\u00f6teborg]]\n|1\u20131\n|0\u20130\n|-\n|[[1996\u201397 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|1996\u201397]]\n|[[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]]\n|QR\n|align=\"left\"|{{flagicon|SVK}} [[\u0160K Futura Humenn\u00e9|Humenn\u00e9]]\n|0\u20132\n|0\u20131\n|-\n|[[2009\u201310 UEFA Europa League|2009\u201310]]\n|rowspan=\"6\"|[[UEFA Europa League]]\n|[[2009\u201310 UEFA Europa League#Second qualifying round|2QR]]\n|align=\"left\"|{{flagicon|SCO}} [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]]\n|1\u20130\n|1\u20138\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[2011\u201312 UEFA Europa League|2011\u201312]]\n|[[2011\u201312 UEFA Europa League#First qualifying round|1QR]]\n|align=\"left\"|{{flagicon|MNE}} [[FK Buducnost Podgorica|Buducnost Podgorica]]\n|1\u20132\n|3\u20131\n|-\n|[[2011\u201312 UEFA Europa League#Second qualifying round|2QR]]\n|align=\"left\"|{{flagicon|CZE}} [[FK Jablonec|Baumit Jablonec]]\n|0\u20132\n|1\u20135\n|-\n|[[2012\u201313 UEFA Europa League|2012\u201313]]\n|[[2012\u201313 UEFA Europa League#First qualifying round|1QR]]\n|align=\"left\"|{{flagicon|HUN}} [[Budapest Honv\u00e9d FC|Budapest Honv\u00e9d]]\n|0\u20131\n|0\u20132\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| [[2014\u201315 UEFA Europa League|2014\u201315]]\n|[[2014\u201315 UEFA Europa League#First qualifying round|1QR]]\n|align=\"left\"|{{flagicon|GEO}} [[FC Sioni Bolnisi|Sioni Bolnisi]]\n|1\u20132\n|3\u20132\n|-\n|[[2014\u201315 UEFA Europa League#Second qualifying round|2QR]]\n|align=\"left\"|{{flagicon|ROU}} [[FC Petrolul Ploie\u0219ti|Petrolul Ploie\u0219ti]]\n|1\u20133\n|0\u20132\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|http://flamurtari.al/}}\n*[http://www.football-lineups.com/team/KS_Flamurtari_Vlore/ Flamurtari Vlor\u00eb] at Football-Lineups.com\n*[http://www.eufo.de/football/alb/flamlore.htm Flamurtari Vlor\u00eb] at EUFO.DE\n*[http://www.uefa.com/footballeurope/club=50070/domestic.html Flamurtari Vlor\u00eb] at [[UEFA]]\n\n{{Albanian Superliga teamlist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Flamurtari Vlore}}\n[[Category:Flamurtari Vlor\u00eb| ]]\n[[Category:1923 establishments in Albania]]\n[[Category:Association football clubs established in 1923]]\n[[Category:Football clubs in Albania]]\n[[Category:Sport in Vlor\u00eb]]\n", "text_old": "{{Dablink|\"FC Flamurtari\" redirects here.

The club play in the [[Albanian Superliga]], which is the top tier of football in the country.\n\nFounded in 1923, the club is one of the oldest in Albania, and it is also one of the most successful clubs, having won one [[Albanian Superliga]] title in 1991 four [[Albanian Cup]]s and two [[Albanian Supercup]]s. Flamurtari is also known for their European runs in the 1980s, where they famously reached the last sixteen in the [[1987\u201388 UEFA Cup]], where they beat Spanish giants [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in [[Vlor\u00eb]] but lost on aggregate.\n\n==History==\n===Foundation===\nKS Flamurtari Vlor\u00eb were founded on 23 March 1923 as ''Shoqeria Sportive Vlor\u00eb'' with Milto Kor\u00e7ari as the club's first ever President, while Malo Ismaili held the role of the secretary and Faslli Zoga that of the financier. The club was created to make sports and especially football more organized and more popular. Its financial needs were covered by donations from the members or from different activities organized in the city of [[Vlor\u00eb]]. Shoqeria Sportive played their first football match against Shoq\u00ebria Sportive Jeronim de Rada, a local team created from students from Vlor\u00eb. The match ended in a 2\u20132 draw. The goals for Shoqeria Sportive were scored by Adem Gavani and Hazbi Tepelena. During the 1920s the club played several friendlies with other Albanian and foreign teams. Interesting were the matches against Crnogorac Cetinje and the football team of the Livorno Naval Institute which the Red and Black Fleet both won 1\u20130 and 3\u20132 respectively. Shoqeria Sportive Vlor\u00eb were a founder member of the [[Albanian Football Association]] and participated in the first championship. Its first official match was against [[KF Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb|Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb]] in Vlor\u00eb and ended with a 2\u20130 win. The team's first captain in an official match was Jani Kosta. In the first championship Shoqeria Sportive finished bottom of the table with two wins (vs. Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb at home, 2\u20130, and vs. [[KF Elbasani|Urani Elbasan]] away, 2\u20131), two draws (vs. Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb away, 0\u20130, and vs. [[KS Vllaznia Shkod\u00ebr|Bashkimi Shkodran]] at home, 1\u20131) and six losses.\n\n===World War II===\nIn the [[1931 Albanian Superliga|1931]] championship Shoqeria Sportive played in [[1931 Albanian Superliga#Group A|Group A]] against [[KF Tirana|Tirana]] and [[KS Vllaznia Shkod\u00ebr|Bashkimi Shkodran]] collecting a win at home against Bashkimi Shkodran and three losses, with a negative goal difference of 4\u20139. Finishing last of the table meant that the team was relegated to the [[Albanian First Division|Kategoria e Dyte]]. Shoqeria Sportive was drawn to play for the next season in [[1932 Albanian First Division#Group C|Group C]] of the ''Kategoria e Dyte'' against [[SK P\u00ebrmeti|Leka i Madh Permet]], Narta and [[KS Luft\u00ebtari Gjirokast\u00ebr|Shqiponja Gjirokast\u00ebr]]. The championship ended with success as the team was crowned champions of Group C and thus qualified for the play-off final against the Group B champion, [[KS Besa Kavaj\u00eb|Sportklub Kavaj\u00eb]]. The one-legged tie ended 3\u20131 in favour of Sportklub Kavaj\u00eb, which meant that Shoqeria Sportive remained for another year in the Second Division. In the next championship [[KS Delvina|Nimet Abazi Delvin\u00eb]] and [[SK Himar\u00eb|Vet\u00ebtima Himar\u00eb]] entered the competition, while Sportklub Narta withdrew. The season proved once again the superiority of the Red and Black team against their Second Division opponents, by finishing once again top of the Group C and securing promotion. In the two-legged final against [[KF Elbasani|Sportklub Elbasan]], which determined the winner of the Second Division, Shoqeria Sportive lost 4\u20133 on aggregate, thus ending the season as runners-up.\n\nThe [[1934 Albanian Superliga|1934]] started with big problems for the team and ended in the worst ways possible, with the ''Kuqezinjte'' drawing one and losing the rest of their matches, closing with a \u221232 goal difference. A total revolution was needed and it came in 1935, when President of the club was chosen Kristaq Strati. He quickly organised the staff and made affiliations with the local amateur teams in Vlore, thus securing young talented players. The team changed the way of playing focusing more on technique and speed and creating its own style of play thanks to the job done by an early activist of the team, Besim Qorri. To complete the revolution on the team, the Board decided to change the team's name from ''Shoq\u00ebria Sportive Vlor\u00eb'' to ''Shoqata Sportive Ismail Qemali''. The next season proved to be more positive and Sh.S. Ismail Qemali finished seventh out of eight teams, but this time with three wins, three draws and eight losses with e goal difference of \u221221 (GF 14&nbsp;\u2013 GA 35). Even though the team had some great results during the season, the most memorable being the 0\u20132 away win against [[KF Elbasani|Bashkimi Elbasanas]], it still didn't avoid a record 11\u20130 defeat against rivals [[KF Tirana|Tirana]]. The [[1937 Albanian Superliga|1937 championship]] was almost the same with the previous season with the team finishing 9th out of ten teams, leaving behind only [[FK Tomori Berat|Tomori Berat]] thanks to a better goal difference.\n\nOn 7 April 1939, Albania was invaded by [[Italy]] and became an Italian protectorate. However, the invaders were careful to keep football going and thus the [[1939 Albanian Superliga|1939]] championship started on July 1, 1939. Eight teams were separated in groups of four and played in a knock-out system with two-legged matches to qualify to the semi-finals. ''Sh.S. Ismail Qemali'' was drawn to play against [[KS Teuta Durr\u00ebs|Teuta]]. The first match was played in Kavaj\u00eb on July 2 and ended in a 1\u20131 draw. The second was played in the ''Shallvare'' Ground in [[Tiran\u00eb]] on 6 August 1939 and ended 3\u20132 in favour of Teuta. This match was one of the earliest football matches to be transmitted on [[Radio Tirana]], by Albanian journalist Anton Mazreku. After the end of the game, ''Sh.S. Ismail Qemali'' appealed against the result, pretending that the last minutes of the game were played on total darkness and the result was affected by the lack of lighting. The Technical Commission decided that the game would be replayed. On 10 September 1939, once again at the ''Shallvare'' Ground the two teams tried to eliminate each other but [[KS Teuta Durr\u00ebs|Teuta]] was superior and won the match by three to one. This meant Sh.S. Ismail Qemali was knocked out of the tournament.\n\n===1945\u20131980===\nIn November 1944, Shoqata Sportive Ismail Qemali was re-opened. The championship began on 16 September 1945 and the club was playing against [[KS Vllaznia Shkod\u00ebr|Vllaznia]]. SH.S. Ismail Qemali lost 1\u20130. The 1945 season saw the team end in fourth place in a 6 team league. The next championship would be better for The Fleet. On 22 June 1946, the club renamed itself ''Klubi Sportiv Flamurtari Vlor\u00eb''. The 1946 season saw Flamurtari going to the championship final after winning First Division Group B. The final was played in two legs, one in [[Vlor\u00eb]] and one in [[Shkod\u00ebr]]. Flamurtari lost both matches with an aggregated score of 5\u20130. In 1948, Flamurtari played once again in the final, still losing to [[FK Partizani Tirana|Partizani Tirana]], 6\u20132 in [[Qemal Stafa]]. In 1951 the club changed its name to ''Puna Vlor\u00eb'', but in 1958 the club used once again the name ''Flamurtari''. In 1954 Flamurtari participated in the Spartak Cup and won the competition after beating [[KS Vllaznia Shkod\u00ebr|Vllaznia]] 6\u20130 and [[KS Teuta]] and [[KS Pogradeci|Ylli i Kuq Pogradec]] 2\u20130. After reaching twice the championship final, in 1960 made it to the [[Albanian Cup]] final. In the first round playing against [[KS Pogradeci|Ylli i Kuq Pogradec]] and beating them both at home and away matches. In the second round Flamurtari would play against [[Besa Kavaj\u00eb]]. The teams drew both matches and had to go on extra time. After 90 minutes played in [[Kavaje]] and 135 minutes played in [[Vlor\u00eb]] the two teams were still equal. Flamurtari passed the second round thanks to the corners rule: the team that had more corners would qualify. These were 8 to 5 for Flamurtari. In the third round Flamurtari played against [[KF Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb|Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb]]. The first match in [[Vlor\u00eb]] ended in a 3\u20130 win for the home side. In [[Korce]], in the 2nd leg match, [[KF Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb|Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb]] were leading 3\u20130 in half-time. In the second half Flamurtari made one of the greatest comebacks in the history of [[Football in Albania|Albanian football]] winning 4\u20133 in the end of the 90 minutes. In the final the team played against [[KS Dinamo Tirana|Dinamo Tirana]] and they lost 1\u20130 after a hard-fought match. The next years were almost same for the team, placed always in mid-table.\n\n===Golden years===\nIn the 1980s Flamurtari regained their former status as one of the big names in [[Football in Albania|Albanian football]]. Flamurtari finished in 8th place in the 1980\u201381 season, but in the following season rose to second, runners-up to [[SK Tirana]]. During the season Flamurtari remained unbeaten in all matches at home in all competitions. In 1981 Flamurtari would participate for the first time in an international cup, the [[Balkans Cup]]. They played [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]] but they lost 3\u20132 in the [[Olympic Stadium (Athens)|Olympic Stadium]] of [[Athens]]. They finished second in their group with two wins and two losses, achieving 7\u20138 goals in the process. In 1983\u201384 Flamurtari once again reached the Albanian Cup final but lost to Tirana. In the season after, Flamurtari won the Albanian Cup. They defeated [[KF Partizani Tirana|KF Partizani]] and thus claimed their first ever professional trophy.\n\nIn 1985\u201386, Flamurtari finished second in the championship losing the trophy only by goal difference to [[KS Dinamo Tirana|Dinamo Tirana]]. Finishing second in the championship, Flamurtari would play in the [[UEFA Cup]]. They were drawn against [[FC Barcelona]]. Flamurtari was eliminated after two draws (1\u20131 in [[Vlor\u00eb]], 0\u20130 in [[Barcelona]]) thanks to the away goal rule. Flamurtari showed their strength by drawing the first match in Barcelona and taking the lead in the 26th minute in Vlor\u00eb, but FC Barcelona scored a late away goal to deny the Fleet's triumph. In that season Flamurtari managed once again to finish in 2nd place and to reach the [[Albanian Cup]] final losing on aggregate, 4\u20133, to [[KS Vllaznia Shkod\u00ebr|Vllaznia]].\n\nAfter a perfect season they gained the right to play for the second consecutive year in the [[UEFA Cup]]. In the first round they had to play against [[Partizan Belgrade]]. After a 2\u20130 win in Vlor\u00eb, a result of a great Rrapo Taho and an own goal, Flamurtari were playing at [[Stadion Partizana|Narodna Armija Stadium]] on 30 September 1987. [[Partizan Belgrade|Partizan]] were leading 2\u20130 until the 76th minute when [[Sokol Kushta]] scored the goal that took Flamurtari in the next round.\n\nIn the second round Flamurtari were drawn against [[FC Erzgebirge Aue|Wismut Aue]]. In the first game in [[Aue]], Flamurtari lost 0\u20131 being denied many times by keeper Weisflog, however in the second leg there was nothing to do for Aue as Flamurtari defeated them, 2\u20130.\n\nIn the third round Flamurtari were drawn once again against [[FC Barcelona]]. First leg was played at [[Camp Nou]] in front of 35,000 spectators on 25 November. Flamurtari scored in the first half and the players went to the first half break with a score Barcelona-Flamurtari 0\u20131.\nHowever, in the second half Barcelona turned the situation in favour and won with scoreline 4\u20131. Flamurtari narrowly won the second leg, 1\u20130, which wasn't enough to secure the next round and was therefore eliminated from [[UEFA Cup]] after six played matches.\n\nIn the same season Flamurtari went all the way to win the [[Albanian Cup]], after beating [[KF Partizani Tirana|KF Partizani]], 1\u20130, and securing their second cup title. In 1989 Flamurtari played in the [[Cup Winners Cup]] against [[Lech Pozna\u0144]]. After two games Flamurtari was eliminated by losing both home and away matches, 4\u20132 on aggregate. In the [[Albanian Superliga|Kategoria Superiore]] the team finished in the third place. Just a year after Flamurtari lifted for the first time in their history the [[Albanian Superliga|Kategoria Superiore]] title. After some stunning results during the season (including beating runners-up Partizani 3\u20130 and third-place [[KS Vllaznia Shkod\u00ebr|Vllaznia]] 5\u20132), they won the championship with a six-point lead. In the same year they would win also the [[Albanian Supercup]].\n\n===The 1990s===\nAfter the fall of communism, Flamurtari had difficult moments. Many players left the club and went to play abroad. In the 1991\u201392 season the club started the championship with \u22126 points because of financial irregularities. Flamurtari finished the [[Albanian Superliga|Kategoria e Pare]] in sixth place. In the next season the club faced a huge crisis finishing the season 13th out of 16 teams. But the team improved a lot and many new players from the Youth Academy were brought in. The 1993\u201394 season saw Flamurtari finishing 2nd and making [[Stadiumi Flamurtari]] a fortress, winning nine and drawing four out of 13 matches played home, but away from home the team had some horrible results culminating with a 5\u20130 away defeat to [[KF La\u00e7i]]. The next two seasons Flamurtari would finish in fourth place. The 1996\u201397 would be the best season for Flamurtari after the fall of communism. The team had a great start in the season with eight wins in the first nine games. Finishing the 1st phase of the championship in the first place, Flamurtari started the second phase while [[Albania]] was suffering the 1997 riots. Flamurtari was leading until the week the championship was suspended and the Albanian Football Association decided to play all games after in [[Tirana]], something Flamurtari could not afford because of the danger. So, the Albanian Football Association decided that the championship would go to [[KF Tirana]] while Flamurtari finished in third place. The next seasons would be the worst for the team in the last 30 years with the team having its best placement in the 1998\u201399 season finishing 11th in a 16 team league.\n\n==Supporters==\nFlamurtari Vlor\u00eb fans are considered as the most passionate in [[Albania]]. They are, also, the vast majority of all Albania, with at least 20% of all Albanians. This is related with the fact that there has not been other football team in [[Vlor\u00eb]]. Usually, as mentioned in Petraq Hanxhari's book \"{{nowrap|{{lang|sq|Per ty, Flamurtar! (For you, Flamurtar!)}}}}\" from Monday to Thursday the fans used to talk in every pub about the team's last game and condition of the players. On Thursday, after the team's usual test match with any local side, the fans would talk about the next game. But nowadays, the support for Flamurtari has been going down. Even though the ticket sales and the number of season-ticket holders has increased rapidly since 1999 (the lowest average attendance in the entire Flamurtari's history), there are much fewer in comparison with the Communist era. The two fan clubs supporting Flamurtari are \"{{nowrap|{{lang|sq|Dragonjte Kuqezi (Red and Black Dragons)}}}}\" and \"{{nowrap|{{lang|sq|Flota Kuqezi (The Red and Black Fleet)}}}}\". The latter usually stay in the East Stand, commonly known as \"Tribuna C\".\n\n==Club rivalries==\nFlamurtari Vlor\u00eb's main rival is [[KF Tirana|Tirana]]. During the 1975s both clubs used to play the most beautiful football in [[Albania]] and the matches between them were the most attended from the supporters. The relations between the two clubs in and out of field were rude and supporters usually have had troubles and violence. Other rivals include the capital teams: [[KS Dinamo Tirana|Dinamo Tirana]] and [[FK Partizani Tirana|Partizani Tirana]]. The rivalry with the capital teams comes from the 1980s famous matches between the clubs and the fact that [[Vlor\u00eb]] was the first capital of Albania and later capital became [[Tirana]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}. There is a lesser rivalry with [[KS Apolonia Fier|Apolonia Fier]] and [[KS Teuta|Teuta]]. The matches against Teuta are called the \"coastal derbies\". At years 2011\u201313, Flamurtari Vlor\u00eb had some troubles against [[KF Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb|Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb]] because of fan's crash of each team but now everything it's OK.\n\n==Stadium==\n{{main|Flamurtari Stadium}}\n[[File:MainStandFlamurtariStadium.JPG|The main stand at the [[Flamurtari Stadium]]|thumb|250px|right]]\nBefore the construction of the stadium, the club played their home games on a field known as Varri i Halimit, which translates to Halimi's Tomb. The field was located near Uji i Ftoht\u00eb, which is where the club's training ground is located. The stadium was built in 1961 with an initial capacity of 6,500, and was expanded to 11,000 in 1975 following reconstruction. During the club's golden era the stadium would attract crowds of up to 15,000 spectators and in 1987 when the club faced [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in the [[UEFA Cup 1987\u201388|UEFA Cup]] there was a crowd of 18,500, making it the ground's record attendance. Between 2004 and 2012 the ground was under recurring development with the aid of the [[Albanian Football Association]] which saw the ground converted into an [[all-seater stadium]] with a capacity of 8,500. In addition to the construction of the stands and the installation of seats, a new parking lot was built and floodlights were installed for the first time.\n\n==Crest and colours==\n===Badges===\n[[File:Old Flamurtari.PNG|thumb|200px|right|Flamurtari's first crest.]]\nThe club's traditional colours are red and black, after the [[Albanian flag]] which was used by [[Ismail Qemali]] to declare [[Albania]]'s independence in [[Vlor\u00eb]] on 28 November 1912. When the club was founded, it was agreed that the colours of the club would match those of the flag, as it had a played a significant role in the city's history. Flamurtari's first crest was designed in 1930 ahead of the club's first competitive match in the inaugural [[Albanian Superliga|Albanian Football Championship]], and it was designed to resemble the Vlor\u00eb Municipality [[coat of arms]]. Following the [[World War II|Second World War]] the club changed its crest to the shape of a shield, with the initial F in black in the middle of the shield on a red background. In the 1980s the club's crest changed once again but the shape and style still remained, but the club still placed the initial F on the football kits rather than the full crest until 2000. On 3 August 2015 the club announced that the crest would be changed ahead of the 2015\u201316 campaign as part of rebranding strategy,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportekspres.com/flamurtari-ndryshon-stemen/|title=Flamurtari ndryshon stemen|trans-title=Flamurtari changes the crest|language=Albanian|publisher=[[Sport Ekspres]]|date=3 August 2015}}</ref> but they faced immediate pressure from fans as well as the local municipality who were unhappy at both the decision to change the crest and the new design.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.botasot.info/sporti/436518/tifozeve-nuk-iu-pelqen-logo-e-re-e-flamurtarit/|title=Tifoz\u00ebve nuk iu p\u00eblqen logo e re e Flamurtarit|trans-title=Fans do not like Flamurtari's new logo|language=Albanian|publisher=[[Bota Sot]]|date=4 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.panorama.com.al/sport/flamurtari-nderron-logon-bashkia-e-jashteligjshme/|title=Flamurtari nd\u00ebrron logon, Bashkia: E jasht\u00ebligjshme|trans-title=Flamurtari switches the logo, Municipality: Outlaw|language=Albanian|publisher=[[Panorama Sport]]|date=5 August 2015}}</ref> The shield shape was replaced by a circle with an F and half of a double headed eagle, as found on the Albanian flag.\n\n===Kits===\n[[File:Flamurtari Kit 1987-1988.PNG|thumb|200px|left|Flamurtari kits during 1987\u201388 season.]]\nA photograph of the first ever official championship game, taken in April 6, 1930, shows the players wearing a white jersey with a thick black horizontal stripe at the chest, black shorts and black socks. This design was common in [[England]] where post office worker and Flamurtari's President, Milto Korcari, ordered them from. Later, in 1937, the team adopted the vertical stripes and started playing in a red jersey with thin vertical black stripes, black shorts and black socks. In the first years of the team's history the kits featured even the team's emblem while later this was replaced with a golden \"F\" sewn in the middle of the chest.\n\nAfter [[World War II]], the team started using red kits, white shorts and red socks. In different championships the team used black shorts instead of white, similar to the design of the [[Albania national football team|Albanian national football team]]. The away kit was all white. This proved to be a popular design with the fans because it reminded them of the national team. In the 1960s however the primary kit was changed again and a new one was introduced. The new kit was white with three vertical stripes in the center (Red&nbsp;\u2013 Black&nbsp;\u2013 Red), black shorts and black socks. The red kit which earlier had been used as a home kit was now used as an away kit for the first team but it remained as a home kit for the youth team. In 1975 the club decided to reverse once again the kits and the red kit with white shorts and red socks became again the home kit. Away the team used its traditional white kit with the three central vertical stripes.\n\n1981 marked the start of a new era at the club. Apart from a new promising generation of footballers blooming from the youth setup and great results on the pitch, a new kit was introduced which remains until today, with minor changes, the club's home kit. The kit was similar to the one used in the late 1930s, red with thin vertical black stripes, red shorts and red socks while the away kit was still the same. The kit proved to be popular with the fans, primarily because of the colours, which are the Albanian [[national colours]], but also with the great achievements the team reached in this period.\n\nOver the years the home kit has not had major changes and the design has remained almost the same, with the change being on the primar colour of the team, sometimes red and sometimes black, and in the colour of the shorts and socks which have changed from red to black. The away kit has been for many years the same with the club using an all-white in only five seasons since 1981.\n\nA new third kit was introduced for the first time in 2005 to celebrate the team winning the [[Albanian First Division]] title. It was all red with red shirts, red shorts and red socks. The kit was used rarely and was dropped for the next season. In 2007 the numbers on the back were of golden colour for the first time in the club's history as the colour mainly used has been white. For the [[2011\u201312 Albanian Superliga]] the team used an outfit based mostly on black. The kit featured a black chevron and red and black stripes below it, black shorts and black socks. The away kit remained the traditional away kit.\n\nFor the [[2012\u201313 Albanian Superliga]]. Flamurtari will use a [[Legea]] design based primarily on red with black thick stripes, black shorts and black socks, while the club decided to drop the traditional away kit in favour of an all-white one.\n\n===Kit evolution===\n{|\n|{{Football kit box |align= left| pattern_la =_redborder |pattern_b = _blackstripes6 | pattern_ra = _redborder | leftarm =000000  | body = FF0000 | rightarm = 000000 | shorts = 000000 | socks = 000000 | title = 1937\u201345}}\n|{{Football kit box |align= left| pattern_la = _blackborder | pattern_ra = _blackborder | leftarm =FF0000  | body = FF0000 | rightarm = FF0000 | shorts = FFFFFF | socks = FF0000 | title = 1946\u201361, 1975\u201381}}\n|{{Football kit box |align= left| pattern_la =  | pattern_b =_vertical_redblackred_band | pattern_ra =  | leftarm =FFFFFF  | body = FFFFFF | rightarm = FFFFFF | shorts = 000000 | socks = 000000 | title = 1961\u201375}}\n|{{Football kit box |align= left| pattern_la =_redborder |pattern_b = _blackstripes6 | pattern_ra = _redborder | leftarm =FF0000  | body = FF0000 | rightarm = FF0000 | shorts = FF0000 | socks = FF0000 | title = 1975\u201390}}\n|{{Football kit box |align= left| pattern_la = |pattern_b = _blackredstripes2 | pattern_ra =  | leftarm =000000  | body = 000000 | rightarm = 000000 | shorts = 000000 | socks = 000000 | title = Late 90s\u2013present}}\n|}\n\n===Shirt sponsors===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Sponsor Type\n!Name\n|-\n|Main sponsor\n|{{flagicon|ALB}} [[Vlor\u00eb|Municipality of Vlor\u00eb]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Secondary sponsors\n|{{flagicon|ALB}} [[Air Albania]]\n|-\n|{{flagicon|TUR}} TRK\n|-\n|Official clothing provider\n|{{flagicon|ITA}} [[Kappa (brand)|Kappa]]\n|}\n\n==Honours==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100% style=\"text-align: center;font-size:100%;\"\n|+Flamurtari Vlor\u00eb honours\n!scope=col|Type\n!scope=col|Competition\n!scope=col|Titles\n!scope=col|Seasons/Years\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|'''Domestic'''\n!scope=col|[[Albanian Cup]]\n|align=\"center\"|'''4'''\n|[[1984\u201385 Albanian Cup|1984\u201385]], [[1987\u201388 Albanian Cup|1987\u201388]], [[2008\u201309 Albanian Cup|2008\u201309]], [[2013\u201314 Albanian Cup|2013\u201314]]\n|-\n!scope=col|[[Albanian Supercup]]\n|align=\"center\"|'''2'''\n|[[1990 Albanian Supercup|1990]], [[1991 Albanian Supercup|1991]]\n|-\n!scope=col|[[Albanian Superliga]]\n|align=\"center\"|'''1'''\n|[[1990\u201391 Albanian Superliga|1990\u201391]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|'''Minor'''\n!scope=col|[[Bashkimi (Democratic Front newspaper)|Bashkimi]] Cup of Journal\n|align=\"center\"|'''3'''\n|1962, 1963, 1987\n|-\n!scope=col|[[Trade Unions of Albania]] Cup\n|rowspan=\"3\"|'''1'''\n|1948\n|-\n!scope=col|[[Party of Labour of Albania]] Cup\n|1976\n|-\n!scope=col|Birra Norga Trophy\n|2007\n|}\n\n==Players==\n===Current squad===\n{{updated|7 January 2020}}\n<!----------------------------- READ THIS NOTICE FIRST BEFORE EDITING ----------------------------------\n \u2013 Do NOT add new players before their signing is officially announced by the club through their website, including medical and signing the contract.

the late 1980s, being one of the most successful Albanian team in the history of European Cups. In [[1986\u201387 UEFA Cup]] season they played against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]. The Spanish giants managed to knock them out only with the help of a late away goal as 1\u20131 in Vlor\u00eb and 0\u20130 in Barcelona. In the [[1987\u201388 UEFA Cup|next season]], Flamurtari managed to knock-out [[FK Partizan|Partizan]] as 2\u20130 in Vlor\u00eb and 1\u20132 in Belgrade and [[FC Erzgebirge Aue|Wismut Aue]] as 0\u20131 in Aue and 2\u20130 in Vlor\u00eb before losing again to [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] as 1\u20134 in Barcelona and 1\u20130 in Vlor\u00eb.

The legend claims that Nizam gave the gold to Prime Minister [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]] in 1965, when the latter visited Hyderabad during an India-wide tour to raise funds for the post-war economy. According to the story, Nizam asked only the boxes containing the gold to be returned.<ref name=\"SN_TH_2018\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/the-truth-about-the-nizam-and-his-gold/article25464770.ece |title=The truth about the Nizam and his gold |author=Serish Nanisetti |date=11 November 2018 }}</ref>{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn reality, the Nizam did not donate 5,000&nbsp;kg of gold, he invested 425&nbsp;kg of gold in the National Defence Gold Scheme.

The scheme included an amnesty clause: the gold acquired using income not disclosed to the income tax authorities was exempted from tax, if invested in the scheme. The Nizam indeed met Shastri in Hyderabad, and agreed to invest 425&nbsp;kg of old gold [[mohur]]s (coins), which were valued at {{INR}} 5 million at the time.

Towards this end, he kept up open negotiations with the Government of India regarding the modalities of a future relationship while opening covert negotiations with Pakistan in a similar vein.

The legend claims that Nizam gave the gold to Prime Minister [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]] in 1965, when the latter visited Hyderabad during an India-wide tour to raise funds for the post-war economy. According to the story, Nizam asked only the boxes containing the gold to be returned.<ref name=\"SN_TH_2018\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/the-truth-about-the-nizam-and-his-gold/article25464770.ece |title=The truth about the Nizam and his gold |author=Serish Nanisetti |date=11 November 2018 }}</ref>{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn reality, the Nizam did not donate 5,000&nbsp;kg of gold, he invested 425&nbsp;kg of gold in the National Defence Gold Scheme. The Scheme was floated by the government in October 1965 to deal with an economic crisis, and the investors were offered a 6.5% interest rate. The scheme included an amnesty clause: the gold acquired using income not disclosed to the income tax authorities was exempted from tax, if invested in the scheme. The Nizam indeed met Shastri in Hyderabad, and agreed to invest 425&nbsp;kg of old gold [[mohur]]s (coins), which were valued at {{INR}} 5 million at the time. Shastri later thanked the Nizam at a public meeting, stating that the government planned to send these gold coins to foreign countries, expecting to obtain {{INR}} 10 million in return.<ref name=\"SN_TH_2018\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/the-truth-about-the-nizam-and-his-gold/article25464770.ece |title=The truth about the Nizam and his gold |author=Serish Nanisetti |date=11 November 2018 }}</ref>\n\nIt is not clear who received the return on this investment. In 2018, the Nizam's grandson [[Mir Najaf Ali Khan]] stated that according to his knowledge, none of the 52 trusts created by the Nizam had received any money from this investment. English-language newspaper ''[[The Hindu]]'' submitted a [[Right to Information Act, 2005|Right to Information]] query to the [[Reserve Bank of India]] (RBI) in 2018 asking for information on the investment and the final beneficiary. However, the RBI refused to provide this information, citing \"unwarranted invasion of the privacy\" clause of the RTI law.<ref name=\"SN_TH_2018\"/>\n\n== Operation Polo and forced abdication ==\n\n[[File:OsmanNehruJN.jpg|thumb|175px|(From left to right): Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], the Nizam and Major [[Jayanto Nath Chaudhuri]] after Hyderabad's accession to India]]\n\n{{Main|Indian annexation of Hyderabad}}\n\nAfter Indian independence in 1947, the country was partitioned into [[India]] and Pakistan. The princely states were left free to make whatever arrangement they wished with either India or Pakistan. The Nizam ruled over more than 16 million people and {{convert|82698|sqmi|km2}} of territory when the British withdrew from the sub-continent in 1947. The Nizam refused to join either India or Pakistan, preferring to form a separate independent kingdom within the British [[Commonwealth of Nations]].\n\nThis proposal for independence was rejected by the British government, but the Nizam continued to explore it. Towards this end, he kept up open negotiations with the Government of India regarding the modalities of a future relationship while opening covert negotiations with Pakistan in a similar vein. The Nizam cited the [[Razakars (Hyderabad)|Razakars]] as evidence that the people of the state were opposed to any agreement with India.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nUltimately the new Indian government decided to invade and capture Hyderabad in 1948, in an operation code named [[Operation Polo]].

We need a [verified] name service for people. Governments will demand it.\" He also said that, \"If I look at enough of your messaging and your location, and use artificial intelligence, we can predict where you are going to go.

Google's privacy policy was changed to state it \"may\" combine web-browsing records obtained through [[DoubleClick]] with what the company learns from the use of other Google services. While new users were automatically opted-in, existing users were asked if they wanted to opt-in, and it remains possible to opt-out by going to the \"Activity controls\" in the \"My Account\" page of a Google account. ''[[ProPublica]]'' states that \"The practical result of the change is that the DoubleClick ads that follow people around on the web may now be customized to them based on your name and other information Google knows about you. It also means that Google could now, if it wished to, build a complete portrait of a user by name, based on everything they write in email, every website they visit and the searches they conduct.\" Google contacted ''ProPublica'' to correct the fact that it doesn't \"currently\" use Gmail keywords to target web ads.<ref name=\"2016 DoubleClick change\"/>\n\nShona Ghosh, a journalist for ''[[Business Insider]]'', noted that an increasing digital [[resistance movement]] against Google has grown.

This could enable Google to determine a user's route through the Internet by tracking the [[IP address]] being used through successive sites (cross-domain [[web tracking]]). Linked to other information made available through Google APIs, which are widely used, Google might be able to provide a quite complete web user profile linked to an IP address or user. This kind of data is invaluable for marketing agencies, and for Google itself to increase the efficiency of its own marketing and advertising activities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Andrienko|first=Gennady|last2=Gkoulalas-Divanis|first2=Aris|last3=Gruteser|first3=Marco|last4=Kopp|first4=Christine|last5=Liebig|first5=Thomas|last6=Rechert|first6=Klaus|date=2013-07-19|title=Report from Dagstuhl: the liberation of mobile location data and its implications for privacy research|journal=SIGMOBILE Mobile Computing and Communications Review|language=en|publisher=ACM|volume=17|issue=2|pages=7|doi=10.1145/2505395.2505398}}</ref>\n\nGoogle encourages developers to use their tools and to communicate end-user IP addresses to Google: \"Developers are also encouraged to make use of the userip parameter to supply the IP address of the end-user on whose behalf you are making the API request.

This allows Google to receive any cookies that they have already set for you, effectively bypassing restrictions on setting third party cookies and allowing traffic correlation with all of Google\u2019s other services, which most users use.

Critics pointed out that a new patent Google was granted in April 2011, for greatly enhanced user tracking through web advertising, will provide much more detailed information on user behavior and that ''do not track'' would hurt Google's ability to exploit this. Software reviewer Kurt Bakke of ''Conceivably Tech'' wrote:\n\n{{quote|Google said that it intends to charge advertisers based on click-through rates, certain user activities and a pay-for-performance model. The entire patent seems to fit Google's recent claims that Chrome is critical for Google to maintain search dominance through its Chrome web browser and Chrome OS and was described as a tool to lock users to Google's search engine and{{snd}} ultimately{{snd}} its advertising services. So, how likely is it that Google will follow the do-not-track trend? Not very likely.<ref name=\"Bakke18Apr11\" />}}\n\nMozilla developer Asa Dotzler noted: \"It seems pretty obvious to me that the Chrome team is bowing to pressure from Google's advertising business and that's a real shame.

The service was launched in 2003 by Google critic Daniel Brandt, who was concerned about Google collecting personal information on its users.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nScroogle offered a web interface and browser plugins for [[Firefox]], [[Google Chrome]], and [[Internet Explorer]] that allowed users to run Google searches anonymously.  The service [[Web scraping|scraped]] Google search results, removing ads and sponsored links.  Only the raw search results were returned, meaning features such as page preview were not available.  For added security, Scroogle gave users the option of having all communication between their computer and the search page be [[Transport Layer Security|SSL]] encrypted.\n\nAlthough Scroogle's activities technically violated Google's terms of service, Google generally tolerated its existence, [[whitelist]]ing the site on multiple occasions. After 2005, the service encountered rapid growth before running into a series of problems starting in 2010.

Critics pointed out that a new patent Google was granted in April 2011, for greatly enhanced user tracking through web advertising, will provide much more detailed information on user behavior and that ''do not track'' would hurt Google's ability to exploit this. Software reviewer Kurt Bakke of ''Conceivably Tech'' wrote:\n\n{{quote|Google said that it intends to charge advertisers based on click-through rates, certain user activities and a pay-for-performance model. The entire patent seems to fit Google's recent claims that Chrome is critical for Google to maintain search dominance through its Chrome web browser and Chrome OS and was described as a tool to lock users to Google's search engine and{{snd}} ultimately{{snd}} its advertising services. So, how likely is it that Google will follow the do-not-track trend? Not very likely.<ref name=\"Bakke18Apr11\" />}}\n\nMozilla developer Asa Dotzler noted: \"It seems pretty obvious to me that the Chrome team is bowing to pressure from Google's advertising business and that's a real shame.

The service was launched in 2003 by Google critic Daniel Brandt, who was concerned about Google collecting personal information on its users.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nScroogle offered a web interface and browser plugins for [[Firefox]], [[Google Chrome]], and [[Internet Explorer]] that allowed users to run Google searches anonymously.  The service [[Web scraping|scraped]] Google search results, removing ads and sponsored links.  Only the raw search results were returned, meaning features such as page preview were not available.  For added security, Scroogle gave users the option of having all communication between their computer and the search page be [[Transport Layer Security|SSL]] encrypted.\n\nAlthough Scroogle's activities technically violated Google's terms of service, Google generally tolerated its existence, [[whitelist]]ing the site on multiple occasions. After 2005, the service encountered rapid growth before running into a series of problems starting in 2010.
