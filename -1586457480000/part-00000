Ultimately, however, the rebellion is betrayed, and the farm ends up in a state as bad as it was before, under the dictatorship of a pig named [[Napoleon (Animal Farm)|Napoleon]].\n\nAccording to Orwell, the [[fable]] reflects events leading up to the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and then on into the [[History of the Soviet Union (1927\u201353)|Stalinist era]] of the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Gcse English Literature}}{{sfn|Meija|2002}}  Orwell, a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]],{{sfn|Orwell |2014 |p=23}} was a critic of [[Joseph Stalin]] and hostile to Moscow-directed [[Stalinism]], an attitude that was critically shaped by his experiences during the [[Spanish Civil War]].{{sfn|Bowker |2013|p=235}}{{efn| Orwell, writing in his review of [[Franz Borkenau]]'s ''The Spanish Cockpit'' in ''[[Time and Tide (magazine)|Time and Tide]]'', 31 July 1937, and \"Spilling the Spanish Beans\", ''New English Weekly'', 29 July 1937}} The Soviet Union, he believed, had become a brutal [[dictatorship]] built upon a [[cult of personality]] and enforced by [[great purge|a reign of terror]]. In a letter to Yvonne Davet, Orwell described ''Animal Farm'' as a [[satire|satirical]] tale against Stalin (\"''{{lang|fr|un conte satirique contre Staline}}''\"),{{sfn|Davison|2000|p=}} and in his essay \"[[Why I Write]]\" (1946), wrote that ''Animal Farm'' was the first book in which he tried, with full consciousness of what he was doing, \"to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole\".{{sfn|Orwell|2014|p=10}}\n\nThe original title was ''Animal Farm: A Fairy Story,'' but U.S. publishers dropped the subtitle when it was published in 1946, and only one of the translations during Orwell's lifetime kept it. Other titular variations include subtitles like \"A Satire\" and \"A Contemporary Satire\".{{sfn|Davison|2000|p=}} Orwell suggested the title ''{{lang|fr|Union des r\u00e9publiques socialistes animales}}'' for the French translation, which abbreviates to URSA, the [[Latin]] word for \"bear\", a [[Russian bear|symbol of Russia]]. It also played on the French name of the Soviet Union, ''{{lang|fr|Union des r\u00e9publiques socialistes sovi\u00e9tiques}}''.{{sfn|Davison|2000|p=}}\n\nOrwell wrote the book between November 1943 and February 1944, when the UK was in its [[Allies of World War II|wartime alliance]] with the Soviet Union against [[Nazi Germany]], and the British people and intelligentsia held Stalin in high esteem, a phenomenon Orwell hated.{{efn|[[Bradbury, Malcolm]], Introduction |p=vi, ''Animal Farm'', Penguin edition, 1989}} The manuscript was initially rejected by a number of British and American publishers,{{sfn|''Animal Farm'': Sixty}} including one of Orwell's own, [[Victor Gollancz]], which delayed its publication. It became a great commercial success when it did appear partly because international relations were transformed as the wartime alliance gave way to the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Dickstein |2007 |p= 134}}\n\n''Time'' magazine chose the book as one of the 100 best English-language novels (1923 to 2005);{{sfn|Grossman|Lacayo|2005|p=}} it also featured at number 31 on the [[Modern Library List of Best 20th-Century Novels]],{{Sfn|Modern Library|1998}} and number 46 on the [[BBC]]'s [[The Big Read]] poll.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/bigread/top100.shtml \"BBC&nbsp;\u2013 The Big Read\"].

One night, the exalted boar, [[Old Major]], organizes a meeting, at which he calls for the overthrow of humans and teaches the animals a revolutionary song called \"[[Beasts of England]]\". When Old Major dies, two young pigs, [[Snowball (Animal Farm)|Snowball]] and [[Napoleon (Animal Farm)|Napoleon]], assume command and stage a revolt, driving Mr. Jones off the farm and renaming the property \"Animal Farm\". They adopt the Seven Commandments of Animalism, the most important of which is, \"All animals are equal\". The decree is painted in large letters on one side of the barn. Snowball teaches the animals to read and write, while Napoleon educates young puppies on the principles of [[#Animalism|Animalism]]. Food is plentiful, and the farm runs smoothly. The pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership and set aside special food items, ostensibly for their personal health. Following an unsuccessful attempt by Mr. Jones and his associates to retake the farm (later dubbed the \"Battle of the Cowshed\"), Snowball announces his plans to modernize the farm by building a [[windmill]]. Napoleon argues against this idea, and matters come to head, which culminate in Napoleon's dogs chasing Snowball away and Napoleon declaring himself supreme commander.\n\nNapoleon enacts changes to the governance structure of the farm, replacing meetings with a committee of pigs who will run the farm. Through a young pig named [[Squealer (Animal Farm)|Squealer]], Napoleon claims credit for the windmill idea, claiming that Snowball actually was only trying to win animals to his side. The animals work harder with the promise of easier lives with the windmill. When the animals find the windmill collapsed after a violent storm, Napoleon and Squealer convince the animals that Snowball is trying to sabotage their project and begin to [[purge]] the farm of animals Napoleon accuses of consorting with his old rival. When some animals recall the Battle of the Cowshed, Napoleon (who was nowhere to be found during the battle) gradually smears Snowball to the point of saying he is a collaborator of Mr. Jones, even dismissing the fact that Snowball was given an award of courage while falsely representing himself as the main hero of the battle. \"Beasts of England\" is replaced with \"Animal Farm\", while an anthem glorifying Napoleon, who appears to be adopting the lifestyle of a man (\"Comrade Napoleon\"), is composed and sung. Many animals who later claim to be helping Snowball in plots are executed by Napoleon's dogs, which troubles the rest of the animals. Despite their hardships, the animals are easily placated by Napoleons retort that they are better off than they were under Mr. Jones, as well as by the sheeps\u2019 chant of \u201cfour legs good, two legs bad\u201d.\n\nMr. Frederick, a neighbouring farmer, attacks the farm, using [[Explosive material|blasting powder]] to blow up the restored windmill. Although the animals win the battle, they do so [[Pyrrhic victory|at great cost]], as many, including [[Boxer (Animal Farm)|Boxer the workhorse]], are wounded. Although he recovers from this, Boxer eventually collapses while working on the windmill (being almost 12 years old at that point). He is taken away in a [[knacker]]'s van, and a donkey called Benjamin alerts the animals of this, but Squealer quickly handwaves this by persuading the animals that the van had been purchased from the knacker by an animal hospital and that the previous owner's signboard had not been repainted. Squealer subsequently reports Boxer's death and martyrizes him with a festival the following day. (However, Napoleon had in fact engineered the sale of Boxer to the knacker, allowing him and his inner circle to acquire money to buy [[whisky]] for themselves.)\n\n{{anchor|moreEqual}}\nYears pass, the windmill is rebuilt, and another windmill is constructed, which makes the farm a good amount of income. However, the ideals that Snowball discussed, including stalls with electric lighting, heating, and running water, are forgotten, with Napoleon advocating that the happiest animals live simple lives. In addition to Boxer, many of the animals who participated in the rebellion are dead or old. Mr. Jones, having moved away after giving up on reclaiming his farm, has also died. The pigs start to resemble humans, as they walk upright, carry whips, drink alcohol, and wear clothes. The Seven Commandments are abridged to just one phrase: ''\"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.\"'' The maxim ''\"Four legs good, two legs bad\"'' is changed to ''\"Four legs good, two legs better.\"'' Napoleon holds a dinner party for the pigs and local farmers, with whom he celebrates a new alliance. He abolishes the practice of the revolutionary traditions and restores the name \"The Manor Farm\". The men and pigs start playing cards, flattering and praising each other while cheating at the game. Both Napoleon and Mr. Pilkington, one of the farmers, play the [[Ace of spades|Ace of Spades]] at the same time and both sides begin fighting loudly over who cheated first. When the animals outside look at the pigs and men, they can no longer distinguish between the two.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Pigs===\n* [[Old Major]] \u2013 An aged prize [[Middle White|Middle White boar]] provides the inspiration that fuels the rebellion. He is an allegorical combination of [[Karl Marx]], one of the creators of communism, and [[Vladimir Lenin]], the communist leader of the [[Russian Revolution]] and the early Soviet nation, in that he draws up the principles of the revolution. His skull being put on revered public display recalls Lenin, whose [[Lenin's Mausoleum|embalmed body was put on display]].{{sfn|Rodden|1999|pp=5ff}} By the end of the book, the skull is reburied.\n* [[Napoleon (Animal Farm)|Napoleon]] \u2013 \"A large, rather fierce-looking [[Berkshire pig|Berkshire]] boar, the only Berkshire on the farm, not much of a talker, but with a reputation for getting his own way\".{{sfn|Orwell|1979|loc=chapter II|p=15}} An allegory of [[Joseph Stalin]],{{sfn|Rodden|1999|pp=5ff}}  Napoleon is the main villain of ''Animal Farm''. \n* [[Snowball (Animal Farm)|Snowball]] \u2013 Napoleon's rival and original head of the farm after Jones' overthrow. His life parallels that of [[Leon Trotsky]],{{sfn|Rodden|1999|pp=5ff}}  but may also combine elements from Lenin.{{sfn|Hitchens|2008|pp=186ff}}{{efn|According to [[Christopher Hitchens]], \"the persons of Lenin and Trotsky are combined into one [i.e., Snowball], or, it might even be [...] to say, there is no Lenin at all.\"{{sfn|Hitchens|2008|pp=186ff}}}}\n* [[Squealer (Animal Farm)|Squealer]] \u2013 A small, white, fat porker who serves as Napoleon's second-in-command and minister of propaganda, holding a position similar to that of [[Vyacheslav Molotov]].{{sfn|Rodden|1999|pp=5ff}}\n* Minimus \u2013 A poetic pig who writes the second and third national anthems of Animal Farm after the singing of \"Beasts of England\" is banned. Rodden compares him to the poet [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]].{{sfn|Rodden|1999|p=11}}\n* The piglets \u2013 Hinted to be the children of Napoleon and are the first generation of animals subjugated to his idea of animal inequality.\n* The young pigs \u2013 Four pigs who complain about Napoleon's takeover of the farm but are quickly silenced and later executed, the first animals killed in Napoleon's farm purge. Likely based on the [[Great Purge]] of [[Grigori Zinoviev]], [[Lev Kamenev]], [[Nikolai Bukharin]], and [[Alexei Rykov]].\n* Pinkeye \u2013 A minor pig who is mentioned only once; he is the pig that tastes Napoleon's food to make sure it is not poisoned, in response to rumours about an assassination attempt on Napoleon.\n\n===Humans===\n* [[Jones (Animal Farm)|Mr. Jones]] \u2013 A heavy drinker who is the original owner of Manor Farm, a farm in disrepair with farmhands who often loaf on the job. He is an allegory of Russian [[Tsar Nicholas II]],{{sfn|Fall of Mister}} who abdicated following the [[February Revolution]] of 1917 and was murdered, along with the rest of his family, by the [[Bolsheviks]] on 17 July 1918. The animals revolt after Jones drinks so much he does not care for them.\n* Mr. Frederick \u2013 The tough owner of Pinchfield, a small but well-kept neighbouring farm, who briefly enters into an alliance with Napoleon.{{sfn|Sparknotes \" Literature}}{{sfn|Scheming Frederick how}}{{sfn|Meyers|1975 |p=141}}{{sfn|Bloom|2009}} Animal Farm shares land boundaries with Pinchfield on one side and Foxwood on another, making Animal Farm a \"buffer zone\" between the two bickering farmers. The animals of Animal Farm are terrified of Frederick, as rumours abound of him abusing his animals and entertaining himself with [[cockfighting]] (a likely allegory for the human rights abuses of [[Adolf Hitler]]). Napoleon enters into an alliance with Frederick in order to sell surplus timber that Pilkington also sought, but is enraged to learn Frederick paid him in counterfeit money. Shortly after the swindling, Frederick and his men invade Animal Farm, killing many animals and destroying the windmill. The brief alliance and subsequent invasion may allude to the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] and [[Operation Barbarossa]].{{sfn|Meyers|1975|p=141}}{{sfn| Firchow |2008 |p=102}}{{sfn| Davison |1996|p= 161}}\n* Mr. Pilkington \u2013 The easy-going but crafty and well-to-do owner of Foxwood, a large neighbouring farm overgrown with weeds. Unlike Frederick, Pilkington is wealthier and owns more land, but his farm is in need of care as opposed to Frederick's smaller but more efficiently-run farm. Although on bad terms with Frederick, Pilkington is also concerned about the animal revolution that deposed Jones and worried that this could also happen to him.\n* Mr. Whymper \u2013 A man hired by Napoleon to act as the liaison between Animal Farm and human society. At first, he is used to acquire necessities that cannot be produced on the farm, such as dog biscuits and [[paraffin wax]], but later he procures luxuries like alcohol for the pigs.\n\n===Equines===\n* [[Boxer (Animal Farm)|Boxer]] \u2013 A loyal, kind, dedicated, extremely strong, hard-working, and respectable cart-horse, although quite naive and gullible.<ref name=\":0\" /> Boxer does a large share of the physical labour on the farm. He is shown to hold the belief that \"Napoleon is always right.\" At one point, he had challenged Squealer's statement that Snowball was always against the welfare of the farm, earning him an attack from Napoleon's dogs. But Boxer's immense strength repels the attack, worrying the pigs that their authority can be challenged. Boxer has been compared to [[Alexey Stakhanov]], a diligent and enthusiastic role model of the [[Stakhanovite movement]].{{sfn|Rodden|1999|p=12}} He has been described as \"faithful and strong\";{{sfn|Sutherland|2005|pp=17\u201319}} he believes any problem can be solved if he works harder.{{sfn|Roper|1977|pp=11\u201363}} When Boxer is injured, Napoleon sells him to a local [[knacker]] to buy himself whisky, and Squealer gives a moving account, falsifying Boxer's death.\n* Mollie \u2013 A self-centred, self-indulgent, and vain young white mare who quickly leaves for another farm after the revolution, in a manner similar to those who left Russia after the fall of the Tsar.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/animalfarm/characters/|title=Animal Farm Characters|last=SparkNotes Editors.|date=2007|website=SparkNotes|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=December 7, 2019}}</ref> She is only once mentioned again.\n* Clover \u2013 A gentle, caring mare, who shows concern especially for Boxer, who often pushes himself too hard. Clover can read all the letters of the alphabet, but cannot \"put words together\". She seems to catch on to the sly tricks and schemes set up by Napoleon and Squealer.\n* [[Benjamin (Animal Farm)|Benjamin]] \u2013 A donkey, one of the oldest, wisest animals on the farm, and one of the few who can read properly. He is skeptical, temperamental, and cynical: his most frequent remark is, \"Life will go on as it has always gone on\u2014that is, badly.\"  The academic Morris Dickstein has suggested there is \"a touch of Orwell himself in this creature's timeless skepticism\"{{sfn|Dickstein |2007| |p=141}} and indeed, friends called Orwell \"Donkey George\", \"after his grumbling donkey Benjamin, in ''Animal Farm''.\"{{sfn|Orwell|2006 |p=236}}\n\n===Other animals===\n* Muriel \u2013 A wise old goat who is friends with all of the animals on the farm. Similarly to Benjamin, Muriel is one of the few animals on the farm who is not a pig but can read.\n* The puppies \u2013 Offspring of Jessie and Bluebell, the puppies were taken away at birth by Napoleon and raised by him to serve as his powerful security force.\n* Moses \u2013 The Raven, \"Mr. Jones's especial pet, was a spy and a tale-bearer, but he was also a clever talker.\"{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} Initially following Mrs. Jones into exile, he reappears several years later and resumes his role of talking but not working. He regales Animal Farm's denizens with tales of a wondrous place beyond the clouds called \"Sugarcandy Mountain, that happy country where we poor animals shall rest forever from our labours!\" Orwell portrays [[Religion and politics|established religion]] as \"the black raven of priestcraft\u2014promising pie in the sky when you die, and faithfully serving whoever happens to be in power.\" Napoleon brings the Raven back (Ch. IX), as Stalin brought back the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].{{sfn|Dickstein|2007|p= 141}}\n* The sheep \u2013 They show limited understanding of Animalism and the political atmosphere of the farm, yet nonetheless they are the voice of blind conformity{{sfn|Dickstein|2007|p=141}} as they bleat their support Napoleon's ideals with jingles during his speeches and meetings with Snowball. Their constant bleating of \"four legs good, two legs bad\" was used as a device to drown out any opposition or alternate views from Snowball, much as Stalin used hysterical crowds to drown out Trotsky.{{sfn|Meyers|1975|p=122}} Towards the latter section of the book, Squealer (the propagandist) trains the sheep to alter their slogan to \"four legs good, two legs better,\" which they dutifully do.\n* The hens \u2013 The hens are promised at the start of the revolution that they will get to keep their eggs, which are stolen from them under Mr. Jones. However, their eggs are soon taken from them under the premise of buying goods from outside Animal Farm. The hens are among the first to rebel, albeit unsuccessfully, against Napoleon.\n* The cows \u2013 The cows are enticed into the revolution by promises that their milk will not be stolen but can be used to raise their own calves. Their milk is then stolen by the pigs, who learn to milk them. The milk is stirred into the pigs' mash every day, while the other animals are denied such luxuries.\n* The cat \u2013 Never seen to carry out any work, the cat is absent for long periods and is forgiven because her excuses are so convincing and she \"purred so affectionately that it was impossible not to believe in her good intentions.\"{{sfn|Orwell|2009|p=52}}  She has no interest in the politics of the farm, and the only time she is recorded as having participated in an election, she is found to have actually \"voted on both sides.\"{{sfn|Orwell|2009|p=25}}\n\n== Genre/Style ==\nGeorge Orwell's ''Animal Farm'' is an example of a political satire that was intended to have a \"wider application,\" according to Orwell himself, in terms of its relevance.<ref name=\":22\">{{Cite journal|last=Dwan|first=David|date=2012|title=Orwell's Paradox: Equality in ''Animal Farm''|journal=ELH|volume=79|issue=3|pages=655\u201383|doi=10.1353/elh.2012.0025|issn=1080-6547}}</ref> Stylistically, the work shares many similarities with some of Orwell's other works, most notably ''1984,'' as both have been considered works of Swiftian Satire.<ref name=\":32\">{{Cite journal|last=Crick|first=Bernard|date=December 31, 1983|title=The real message of '1984': Orwell's Classic Re-assessed |url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/document-view?p=AWNB&docref=news/1139870DADC7F880|journal=Financial Times|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Furthermore, these two prominent works seem to suggest Orwell's bleak view of the future for humanity; he seems to stress the potential/current threat of dystopias similar to those in ''Animal Farm'' and ''1984''.<ref name=\":42\">{{Cite web|url=https://rosariomariocapalbo.wordpress.com/2011/04/10/george-orwell-dystopian-novel-1984-animal-farm/|title=George Orwell: Dystopian Novel \u2013 1984 \u2013 Animal Farm |last=rosariomario|date=2011-04-10|website=Spazio personale di mario aperto a tutti 24 ore su|language=en|access-date=2019-11-26}}</ref> In these kinds of works, Orwell distinctly references the disarray and traumatic conditions of Europe following the Second World War.<ref name=\":52\">{{Cite journal|last=Orwell|first=George|date=|title=Politics and the English Language|journal=Literary Cavalcade|volume=54|pages=20\u201326|id={{ProQuest|210475382}}}}</ref> Orwell's style and writing philosophy as a whole was very concerned with the pursuit of truth in writing.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=KnowledgeNotes|date=1996|title=Animal Farm|journal=Signet Classic|volume=|pages=|id={{ProQuest|2137893954}}}}</ref> Orwell was committed to communicating in a way that was straightforward, given the way that he felt words were commonly used in politics to deceive and confuse.<ref name=\":02\" /> For this reason, he is careful, in ''Animal Farm'', to make sure the narrator speaks in an unbiased and uncomplicated fashion.<ref name=\":02\" /> The difference is seen in the way that the animals speak and interact, as the generally moral animals seem to speak their minds clearly, while the wicked animals on the farm, such as Napoleon, twist language in such a way that it meets their own insidious desires.<ref name=\":02\" /> This style reflects Orwell's close proximation to the issues facing Europe at the time and his determination to comment critically on Stalin's Soviet Russia.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Origin ===\nGeorge Orwell wrote the manuscript in 1943 and 1944 after his experiences during the [[Spanish Civil War]], which he described in ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'' (1938). In the preface of a 1947 Ukrainian edition of ''Animal Farm'', he explained how escaping the communist purges in Spain taught him \"how easily totalitarian propaganda can control the opinion of enlightened people in democratic countries.\"{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} This motivated Orwell to expose and strongly condemn what he saw as the [[Stalinist]] corruption of the original socialist ideals.{{sfn|Orwell|1947|p=}} ''Homage to Catalonia'' sold poorly; after seeing [[Arthur Koestler]]'s best-selling, ''[[Darkness at Noon]],'' about the same war, Orwell decided that fiction was the best way to describe totalitarianism.{{r|dalrymple20190824}}\n\nImmediately prior to writing the book, Orwell had quit the [[BBC]]. He was also upset about a booklet for propagandists the Ministry of Information had put out. The booklet included instructions on how to quell ideological fears of the Soviet Union, such as directions to claim that the Red Terror was a figment of Nazi imagination.{{sfn|Overy |1997 |p=297}}\n\nIn the preface, Orwell described the source of the idea of setting the book on a farm:{{sfn|Orwell|1947|p=}}\n{{quote\n|...I saw a little boy, perhaps ten years old, driving a huge carthorse along a narrow path, whipping it whenever it tried to turn. It struck me that if only such animals became aware of their strength we should have no power over them, and that men exploit animals in much the same way as the rich exploit the proletariat.\n}}\n\n==Publication==\n\n===Publishing===\nOrwell initially encountered difficulty getting the manuscript published, largely due to fears that the book might upset the alliance between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Four publishers refused to publish ''Animal Farm'', yet one had initially accepted the work, but declined it after consulting the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]].{{sfn|Freedom of the Press}}{{efn|[[#GOIT|Orwell 1976 p. 25 ''La libert\u00e0 di stampa'']]}} Eventually, [[Secker and Warburg]] published the first edition in 1945.\n\nDuring the [[World War II|Second World War]], it became clear to Orwell that anti-Soviet literature was not something which most major publishing houses would touch\u2014including his regular publisher [[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz]]. He also submitted the manuscript to [[Faber and Faber]], where the poet [[T. S. Eliot]] (who was a director of the firm) rejected it; Eliot wrote back to Orwell praising the book's \"good writing\" and \"fundamental integrity\", but declared that they would only accept it for publication if they had some sympathy for the viewpoint \"which I take to be generally [[Deformed workers' state|Trotskyite]]\". Eliot said he found the view \"not convincing\", and contended that the pigs were made out to be the best to run the farm; he posited that someone might argue \"what was needed... was not more communism but more public-spirited pigs\".{{sfn|Eliot|1969}} Orwell let [[Andr\u00e9 Deutsch]], who was working for Nicholson & Watson in 1944, read the typescript, and Deutsch was convinced that Nicholson & Watson would want to publish it; however, they did not, and \"lectured Orwell on what they perceived to be errors in ''Animal Farm''.\"{{sfn|Orwell |2013|p= 231}} In his ''London Letter'' on 17 April 1944 for ''[[Partisan Review]]'', Orwell wrote that it was \"now next door to impossible to get anything overtly anti-Russian printed. Anti-Russian books do appear, but mostly from Catholic publishing firms and always from a religious or frankly reactionary angle.\"\n\nThe publisher [[Jonathan Cape]], who had initially accepted ''Animal Farm'', subsequently rejected the book after an official at the British Ministry of Information warned him off{{sfn|Whitewashing of Stalin |2008}}\u2014although the civil servant who it is assumed gave the order was later found to be a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spy.{{sfn|Taylor|2003|p=337}} Writing to [[Leonard Moore (literary agent)|Leonard Moore]], a partner in the literary agency of Christy & Moore, publisher Jonathan Cape explained that the decision had been taken on the advice of a senior official in the Ministry of Information. Such flagrant anti-Soviet bias was unacceptable, and the choice of pigs as the dominant class was thought to be especially offensive. It may reasonably be assumed that the \"important official\" was a man named [[Peter Smollett]], who was later unmasked as a Soviet agent.{{sfn| Leab  |2007 |p= 3}}  Orwell was suspicious of Smollett/Smolka, and he would be one of the names Orwell [[Orwell's list|included in his list]] of Crypto-Communists and Fellow-Travellers sent to the [[Information Research Department]] in 1949. The publisher wrote to Orwell, saying:{{sfn|Whitewashing of Stalin |2008}}\n{{quote |\nIf the fable were addressed generally to dictators and dictatorships at large then publication would be all right, but the fable does follow, as I see now, so completely the progress of the Russian Soviets and their two dictators [Lenin and Stalin], that it can apply only to Russia, to the exclusion of the other dictatorships.\n\nAnother thing: it would be less offensive if the predominant caste in the fable were not pigs. I think the choice of pigs as the ruling caste will no doubt give offence to many people, and particularly to anyone who is a bit touchy, as undoubtedly the Russians are.\n}}\n\n[[Frederic Warburg]] also faced pressures against publication, even from people in his own office and from his wife Pamela, who felt that it was not the moment for ingratitude towards Stalin and the heroic [[Red Army]],{{sfn|Fyvel|1982 |p=139}} which had [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|played a major part]] in defeating [[Adolf Hitler]]. A Russian translation was printed in the paper ''Posev'', and in giving permission for a Russian translation of ''Animal Farm'', Orwell refused in advance all royalties.

''Telling the Russians'', written for the Russian journal ''New Russian Wind'', reprinted in Remembering Orwell |pp=260\u201361}}\n\nIn October 1945, Orwell wrote to Frederic Warburg expressing interest in pursuing the possibility that the political cartoonist [[David Low (cartoonist)|David Low]] might illustrate ''Animal Farm''. Low had written a letter saying that he had had \"a good time with ''ANIMAL FARM''\u2014an excellent bit of satire\u2014it would illustrate perfectly.\" Nothing came of this, and a trial issue produced by Secker & Warburg in 1956 illustrated by John Driver was abandoned, but the [[Folio Society]] published an edition in 1984 illustrated by [[Quentin Blake]] and an edition illustrated by the cartoonist [[Ralph Steadman]] was published by Secker & Warburg in 1995 to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the first edition of ''Animal Farm''.{{sfn|Orwell|2001|p= 123 }}{{sfn|Orwell|2015|pp= 313\u201314}}\n\n===Preface===\nOrwell originally wrote a preface complaining about British [[self-censorship]] and how the British people were suppressing criticism of the USSR, their World War II ally:\n{{quote|The sinister fact about literary censorship in England is that it is largely voluntary.... Things are kept right out of the British press, not because the Government intervenes but because of a general tacit agreement that 'it wouldn't do' to mention that particular fact.}}\nAlthough the first edition allowed space for the preface, it was not included,{{sfn|Freedom of the Press}} and as of June 2009 most editions of the book have not included it.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nSecker and Warburg published the first edition of ''Animal Farm'' in 1945 without an introduction. However, the publisher had provided space for a preface in the author's proof composited from the manuscript. For reasons unknown, no preface was supplied, and the page numbers had to be renumbered at the last minute.{{sfn|Freedom of the Press}}\n\nIn 1972, [[Ian Angus (librarian)|Ian Angus]] found the original typescript titled \"The Freedom of the Press\", and [[Bernard Crick]] published it, together with his own introduction, in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' on 15 September 1972 as \"How the essay came to be written\".{{sfn|Freedom of the Press}}  Orwell's essay criticised British self-censorship by the press, specifically the suppression of unflattering descriptions of Stalin and the Soviet government.{{sfn|Freedom of the Press}} The same essay also appeared in the Italian 1976 edition of ''Animal Farm'' with another introduction by Crick, claiming to be the first edition with the preface. Other publishers were still declining to publish it.{{Clarify|date=March 2010|reason=more details needed, were some actively refusing, unaware of the preface?}}\n\n==Reception==\nContemporary reviews of the work were not universally positive. Writing in the American ''[[The New Republic|New Republic]]'' magazine, George Soule expressed his disappointment in the book, writing that it \"puzzled and saddened me. It seemed on the whole dull. The allegory turned out to be a creaking machine for saying in a clumsy way things that have been said better directly.\" Soule believed that the animals were not consistent enough with their real-world inspirations, and said, \"It seems to me that the failure of this book (commercially it is already assured of tremendous success) arises from the fact that the satire deals not with something the author has experienced, but rather with stereotyped ideas about a country which he probably does not know very well\".{{sfn|Soule|1946}}\n\n''[[The Guardian]]'' on 24 August 1945 called ''Animal Farm'' \"a delightfully humorous and caustic satire on the rule of the many by the few\".{{sfn|Books of day|1945}}  [[Tosco Fyvel]], writing in ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]'' on the same day, called the book \"a gentle satire on a certain State and on the illusions of an age which may already be behind us.\" [[Julian Symons]] responded, on 7 September, \"Should we not expect, in ''Tribune'' at least, acknowledgement of the fact that it is a satire not at all gentle upon a particular State\u2014Soviet Russia? It seems to me that a reviewer should have the courage to identify Napoleon with Stalin, and Snowball with Trotsky, and express an opinion favourable or unfavourable to the author, upon a political ground. In a hundred years time perhaps, ''Animal Farm'' may be simply a fairy story, today it is a political satire with a good deal of point.\" ''Animal Farm'' has been subject to much comment in the decades since these early remarks.{{sfn|Orwell | 2015|p= 253}}\n\nThe [[CIA]] from 1952 to 1957 in Operation Aedinosaur sent millions of balloons carrying copies of the novel into Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia, whose air forces tried to shoot the balloons down.<ref name=\"dalrymple20190824\">{{Cite magazine |last=Dalrymple |first=William |author-link=William Dalrymple (historian) |title=Novel explosives of the Cold War |url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2019/08/novel-explosives-of-the-cold-war/ |magazine=The Spectator |archive-url=https://outline.com/X9SnJv |archive-date=2019-08-26}}</ref>\n\n''Time'' magazine chose ''Animal Farm'' as one of the 100 best English-language novels (1923 to 2005);{{sfn|Grossman|Lacayo|2005|p=}} it also featured at number 31 on the [[Modern Library List of Best 20th-Century Novels]].{{Sfn|Modern Library|1998}} It won a [[Retro-Hugo|Retrospective Hugo Award]] in 1996 and is included in the [[Great Books of the Western World]] selection.<ref name=\"Western books\"/>\n\nPopular reading in schools, a 2016 UK poll saw ''Animal Farm'' ranked the nation's favourite book from school.<ref>{{cite news |title=George Orwell's Animal Farm tops list of the nation's favourite books from school |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/george-orwells-animal-farm-tops-list-of-the-nations-favourite-books-from-school-a6994351.html |accessdate=15 December 2019 |work=The Independent}}</ref>\n\n''Animal Farm'' has also faced an array of challenges in school settings around the US.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/advocacy/bbooks/frequentlychallengedbooks/classics|title=Banned & Challenged Classics|last=admin|date=2013-03-26|website=Advocacy, Legislation & Issues|language=en|access-date=2019-11-26}}</ref> The following are examples of this controversy that has existed around Orwell's work:\n* The [[John Birch Society]] in Wisconsin challenged the reading of ''Animal Farm'' in 1965 because of its reference to masses revolting.<ref name=\":1\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bannedlibrary.com/podcast/2017/1/22/animal-farm-and-other-books-not-meant-for-children|title=Animal Farm by George Orwell|website=Banned Library|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-15}}</ref>\n* New York State English Council's Committee on Defense Against Censorship found that in 1968 ''Animal Farm'' had been widely deemed a \"problem book.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n* A censorship survey conducted in DeKalb County, Georgia, regarding the years 1979\u20131982, revealed that many schools had attempted to limit access to ''Animal Farm'' due to its \"political theories.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Superintendent in Bay County, Florida, bans ''Animal Farm'' at the middle school and high school levels in 1987.<ref name=\":1\" />\n** The Board quickly brought back the book, however, after receiving complaints of the ban as \"unconstitutional\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n* ''Animal Farm'' was removed from a school district's curriculum in 2017 in Stonington, Connecticut.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=1991|title=Water availability and quality from the stratified drift in Anguilla Brook basin, Stonington and North Stonington, Connecticut|doi=10.3133/wri854276|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1908948ab340182a75e7d5d5e74e373ddff5c29a}}</ref>\n\n''Animal Farm'' has also faced similar forms of resistance in other countries.<ref name=\":1\"/> The ALA also mentions the way that the book was prevented from being featured at the International Book Fair in Moscow, Russia, in 1977 and banned from schools in the United Arab Emirates for references to practices or actions that defy Arab or Islamic beliefs, such as pigs or alcohol.<ref name=\":1\"/>  In the same manner, ''Animal Farm'' has also faced relatively recent issues in China.

Soon after, Napoleon and Squealer partake in activities associated with the humans (drinking alcohol, sleeping in beds, trading), which were explicitly prohibited by the Seven Commandments. Squealer is employed to alter the Seven Commandments to account for this humanisation, an [[allusion]] to the Soviet government's revising of history in order to exercise control of the people's beliefs about themselves and their society.{{sfn|Rodden|1999|pages=48\u201349}}\n[[File:Animal Farm artwork.jpg|thumb|Squealer sprawls at the foot of the end wall of the big barn where the Seven Commandments were written (ch. viii) \u2013 preliminary artwork for a 1950 strip cartoon by [[Norman Pett]] and Donald Freeman]]\n\nThe original commandments are:\n# Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.\n# Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend.\n# No animal shall wear clothes.\n# No animal shall sleep in a bed.\n# No animal shall drink alcohol.\n# No animal shall kill any other animal.\n# All animals are equal.\n\nThese commandments are also distilled into the maxim \"Four legs good, two legs bad!\" which is primarily used by the sheep on the farm, often to disrupt discussions and disagreements between animals on the nature of Animalism.\n\nLater, Napoleon and his pigs secretly revise some commandments to clear themselves of accusations of law-breaking. The changed commandments are as follows, with the changes bolded:\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>No animal shall sleep in a bed '''with sheets'''.</li>\n<li>No animal shall drink alcohol '''to excess'''.</li>\n<li>No animal shall kill any other animal '''without cause'''.</li>\n</ol>\nEventually, these are replaced with the maxims, \"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others\", and \"Four legs good, two legs better\" as the pigs become more human. This is an [[Irony|ironic]] twist to the original purpose of the Seven Commandments, which were supposed to keep order within Animal Farm by uniting the animals together against the humans and preventing animals from following the humans' evil habits. Through the revision of the commandments, Orwell demonstrates how simply political [[dogma]] can be turned into malleable [[propaganda]].{{sfn|Carr|2010|pp=78\u201379}}\n\n===Significance and allegory===\n[[File:Flag_of_the_Animal_Farm.svg|thumb|left|The Horn and Hoof flag described in the book appears to be based on the [[hammer and sickle]], the Communist symbol.

Czapski, a survivor of the [[Katyn Massacre]] and an opponent of the Soviet regime, told Orwell, as Orwell wrote to [[Arthur Koestler]], that it had been \"the character [and] greatness of Stalin\" that saved Russia from the German invasion.{{efn|A Note on the Text, Peter Davison, ''Animal Farm'', Penguin edition 1989 |p=xx}}\n\n[[File:15th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks).jpg|thumb|Front row (left to right): [[Alexey Rykov|Rykov]], [[Mykola Skrypnyk|Skrypnyk]], and [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] \u2013 'When Snowball comes to the crucial points in his speeches he is drowned out by the sheep (Ch.

Ultimately, however, the rebellion is betrayed and the farm ends up in a state as bad as it was before, under the dictatorship of a pig named [[Napoleon (Animal Farm)|Napoleon]].\n\nAccording to Orwell, the [[fable]] reflects events leading up to the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and then on into the [[History of the Soviet Union (1927\u201353)|Stalinist era]] of the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Gcse English Literature}}{{sfn|Meija|2002}}  Orwell, a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]],{{sfn|Orwell |2014 |p=23}} was a critic of [[Joseph Stalin]] and hostile to Moscow-directed [[Stalinism]], an attitude that was critically shaped by his experiences during the [[Spanish Civil War]].{{sfn|Bowker |2013|p=235}}{{efn| Orwell, writing in his review of [[Franz Borkenau]]'s ''The Spanish Cockpit'' in ''[[Time and Tide (magazine)|Time and Tide]]'', 31 July 1937, and \"Spilling the Spanish Beans\", ''New English Weekly'', 29 July 1937}} The Soviet Union, he believed, had become a brutal [[dictatorship]], built upon a [[cult of personality]] and enforced by [[great purge|a reign of terror]]. In a letter to Yvonne Davet, Orwell described ''Animal Farm'' as a [[satire|satirical]] tale against Stalin (\"''{{lang|fr|un conte satirique contre Staline}}''\"),{{sfn|Davison|2000|p=}} and in his essay \"[[Why I Write]]\" (1946), wrote that ''Animal Farm'' was the first book in which he tried, with full consciousness of what he was doing, \"to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole\".{{sfn|Orwell|2014|p=10}}\n\nThe original title was ''Animal Farm: A Fairy Story,'' but U.S. publishers dropped the subtitle when it was published in 1946, and only one of the translations during Orwell's lifetime kept it. Other titular variations include subtitles like \"A Satire\" and \"A Contemporary Satire\".{{sfn|Davison|2000|p=}} Orwell suggested the title ''{{lang|fr|Union des r\u00e9publiques socialistes animales}}'' for the French translation, which abbreviates to URSA, the [[Latin]] word for \"bear\", a [[Russian bear|symbol of Russia]]. It also played on the French name of the Soviet Union, ''{{lang|fr|Union des r\u00e9publiques socialistes sovi\u00e9tiques}}''.{{sfn|Davison|2000|p=}}\n\nOrwell wrote the book between November 1943 and February 1944, when the UK was in its [[Allies of World War II|wartime alliance]] with the Soviet Union against [[Nazi Germany]] and the British people and intelligentsia held Stalin in high esteem, a phenomenon Orwell hated.{{efn|[[Bradbury, Malcolm]], Introduction |p=vi, ''Animal Farm'', Penguin edition, 1989}} The manuscript was initially rejected by a number of British and American publishers,{{sfn|''Animal Farm'': Sixty}} including one of Orwell's own, [[Victor Gollancz]], which delayed its publication. It became a great commercial success when it did appear partly because international relations were transformed as the wartime alliance gave way to the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Dickstein |2007 |p= 134}}\n\n''Time'' magazine chose the book as one of the 100 best English-language novels (1923 to 2005);{{sfn|Grossman|Lacayo|2005|p=}} it also featured at number 31 on the [[Modern Library List of Best 20th-Century Novels]],{{Sfn|Modern Library|1998}} and number 46 on the [[BBC]]'s [[The Big Read]] poll.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/bigread/top100.shtml \"BBC&nbsp;\u2013 The Big Read\"].

One night, the exalted boar [[Old Major]] organizes a meeting, at which he calls for the overthrow of humans and teaches the animals a revolutionary song called \"[[Beasts of England]]\". When Old Major dies, two young pigs, [[Snowball (Animal Farm)|Snowball]] and [[Napoleon (Animal Farm)|Napoleon]], assume command and stage a revolt, driving Mr. Jones off the farm and renaming the property \"Animal Farm\". They adopt the Seven Commandments of Animalism, the most important of which is, \"All animals are equal\". The decree is painted in large letters on one side of the barn. Snowball teaches the animals to read and write, while Napoleon educates young puppies on the principles of [[#Animalism|Animalism]]. Food is plentiful, and the farm runs smoothly. The pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership and set aside special food items, ostensibly for their personal health. Following an unsuccessful attempt by Mr. Jones and his associates to retake the farm (later dubbed the \"Battle of the Cowshed\"), Snowball announces his plans to modernize the farm by building a [[windmill]]. Napoleon argues against this idea and matters come to head which culminates with his dogs chase Snowball away and he declaring himself supreme commander.\n\nNapoleon enacts changes to the governance structure of the farm, replacing meetings with a committee of pigs who will run the farm. Through a young pig named [[Squealer (Animal Farm)|Squealer]], Napoleon claims credit for the windmill idea, claiming that Snowball actually was only trying to win animals to his side. The animals work harder with the promise of easier lives with the windmill. When the animals find the windmill collapsed after a violent storm, Napoleon and Squealer convince the animals that Snowball is trying to sabotage their project, and begin to [[purge]] the farm of animals Napoleon accuses of consorting with his old rival. When some animals recall the Battle of the Cowshed, Napoleon (who was nowhere to be found during the battle) gradually smears Snowball to the point of saying he as a collaborator of Mr. Jones, even dismissing the fact that Snowball was given an award of courage while falsely representing himself as the main hero of the battle. \"Beasts of England\" is replaced with \"Animal Farm\", while an anthem glorifying Napoleon, who appears to be adopting the lifestyle of a man (\"Comrade Napoleon\"), is composed and sung. Many animals who later claim to be helping Snowball in plots are executed by Napoleon's dogs, which troubles the rest of the animals. Despite their hardships, the animals are easily placated by Napoleons retort that they are better off than they were under Mr. Jones, as well as by the sheeps\u2019 chant of \u201cfour legs good, two legs bad\u201d.\n\nMr. Frederick, a neighbouring farmer, attacks the farm, using [[Explosive material|blasting powder]] to blow up the restored windmill. Although the animals win the battle, they do so [[Pyrrhic victory|at great cost]], as many, including [[Boxer (Animal Farm)|Boxer the workhorse]], are wounded. Although he recovers from this, Boxer eventually collapses while working on the windmill (being almost 12 years old at that point). He is taken away in a [[knacker]]'s van, and a donkey called Benjamin alerts the animals of this, but Squealer quickly handwaves this by persuading the animals that the van had been purchased from the knacker by an animal hospital and that the previous owner's signboard had not been repainted. Squealer subsequently reports Boxer's death and martyrizes him with a festival the following day. (However, Napoleon had in fact engineered the sale of Boxer to the knacker, allowing him and his inner circle to acquire money to buy [[whisky]] for themselves.)\n\n{{anchor|moreEqual}}\nYears pass, the windmill is rebuilt, and another windmill is constructed, which makes the farm a good amount of income. However, the ideals which Snowball discussed, including stalls with electric lighting, heating, and running water, are forgotten, with Napoleon advocating that the happiest animals live simple lives. In addition to Boxer, many of the animals who participated in the rebellion are dead or old. Mr. Jones, having moved away after giving up on reclaiming his farm, has also died. The pigs start to resemble humans, as they walk upright, carry whips, drink alcohol and wear clothes. The Seven Commandments are abridged to just one phrase: ''\"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.\"'' and the maxim ''\"Four legs good, two legs bad.\"'' is changed to ''\"Four legs good, two legs better.\"'' Napoleon holds a dinner party for the pigs and local farmers, with whom he celebrates a new alliance. He abolishes the practice of the revolutionary traditions and restores the name \"The Manor Farm\". The men and pigs start playing cards, flattering and praising each other while cheating at the game. Both Napoleon and Mr. Pilkington, one of the farmers, play the [[Ace of spades|Ace of Spades]] at the same time and both sides begin fighting loudly over who cheated first. When the animals outside look at the pigs and men, they can no longer distinguish between the two.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Pigs===\n* [[Old Major]] \u2013 An aged prize [[Middle White|Middle White boar]] provides the inspiration that fuels the rebellion. He is an allegorical combination of [[Karl Marx]], one of the creators of communism, and [[Vladimir Lenin]], the communist leader of the [[Russian Revolution]] and the early Soviet nation, in that he draws up the principles of the revolution. His skull being put on revered public display recalls Lenin, whose [[Lenin's Mausoleum|embalmed body was put on display]].{{sfn|Rodden|1999|pp=5ff}} By the end of the book, the skull is reburied.\n* [[Napoleon (Animal Farm)|Napoleon]] \u2013 \"A large, rather fierce-looking [[Berkshire pig|Berkshire]] boar, the only Berkshire on the farm, not much of a talker, but with a reputation for getting his own way\".{{sfn|Orwell|1979|loc=chapter II|p=15}} An allegory of [[Joseph Stalin]],{{sfn|Rodden|1999|pp=5ff}}  Napoleon is the main villain of ''Animal Farm''. \n* [[Snowball (Animal Farm)|Snowball]] \u2013 Napoleon's rival and original head of the farm after Jones' overthrow. His life parallels that of [[Leon Trotsky]],{{sfn|Rodden|1999|pp=5ff}}  but may also combine elements from Lenin.{{sfn|Hitchens|2008|pp=186ff}}{{efn|According to [[Christopher Hitchens]], \"the persons of Lenin and Trotsky are combined into one [i.e., Snowball], or, it might even be [...] to say, there is no Lenin at all.\"{{sfn|Hitchens|2008|pp=186ff}}}}\n* [[Squealer (Animal Farm)|Squealer]] \u2013 A small, white, fat porker who serves as Napoleon's second-in-command and minister of propaganda, holding a position similar to that of [[Vyacheslav Molotov]].{{sfn|Rodden|1999|pp=5ff}}\n* Minimus \u2013 A poetic pig who writes the second and third national anthems of Animal Farm after the singing of \"Beasts of England\" is banned. Rodden compares him to the poet [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]].{{sfn|Rodden|1999|p=11}}\n* The piglets \u2013 Hinted to be the children of Napoleon and are the first generation of animals subjugated to his idea of animal inequality.\n* The young pigs \u2013 Four pigs who complain about Napoleon's takeover of the farm but are quickly silenced and later executed, the first animals killed in Napoleon's farm purge. Likely based on the [[Great Purge]] of [[Grigori Zinoviev]], [[Lev Kamenev]], [[Nikolai Bukharin]], and [[Alexei Rykov]].\n* Pinkeye \u2013 A minor pig who is mentioned only once; he is the pig that tastes Napoleon's food to make sure it is not poisoned, in response to rumours about an assassination attempt on Napoleon.\n\n===Humans===\n* [[Jones (Animal Farm)|Mr. Jones]] \u2013 A heavy drinker who is the original owner of Manor Farm, a farm in disrepair with farmhands who often loaf on the job. He is an allegory of Russian [[Tsar Nicholas II]],{{sfn|Fall of Mister}} who abdicated following the [[February Revolution]] of 1917 and was murdered, along with the rest of his family, by the [[Bolsheviks]] on 17 July 1918. The animals revolt after Jones drinks so much he does not care for them.\n* Mr. Frederick \u2013 The tough owner of Pinchfield, a small but well-kept neighbouring farm, who briefly enters into an alliance with Napoleon.{{sfn|Sparknotes \" Literature}}{{sfn|Scheming Frederick how}}{{sfn|Meyers|1975 |p=141}}{{sfn|Bloom|2009}} Animal Farm shares land boundaries with Pinchfield on one side and Foxwood on another, making Animal Farm a \"buffer zone\" between the two bickering farmers. The animals of Animal Farm are terrified of Frederick, as rumours abound of him abusing his animals and entertaining himself with [[cockfighting]] (a likely allegory for the human rights abuses of [[Adolf Hitler]]). Napoleon enters into an alliance with Frederick in order to sell surplus timber that Pilkington also sought, but is enraged to learn Frederick paid him in counterfeit money. Shortly after the swindling, Frederick and his men invade Animal Farm, killing many animals and destroying the windmill. The brief alliance and subsequent invasion may allude to the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] and [[Operation Barbarossa]].{{sfn|Meyers|1975|p=141}}{{sfn| Firchow |2008 |p=102}}{{sfn| Davison |1996|p= 161}}\n* Mr. Pilkington \u2013 The easy-going but crafty and well-to-do owner of Foxwood, a large neighbouring farm overgrown with weeds. Unlike Frederick, Pilkington is wealthier and owns more land, but his farm is in need of care as opposed to Frederick's smaller but more efficiently-run farm. Although on bad terms with Frederick, Pilkington is also concerned about the animal revolution that deposed Jones and worried that this could also happen to him.\n* Mr. Whymper \u2013 A man hired by Napoleon to act as the liaison between Animal Farm and human society. At first, he is used to acquire necessities that cannot be produced on the farm, such as dog biscuits and [[paraffin wax]], but later he procures luxuries like alcohol for the pigs.\n\n===Equines===\n* [[Boxer (Animal Farm)|Boxer]] \u2013 A loyal, kind, dedicated, extremely strong, hard-working, and respectable cart-horse, although quite naive and gullible.<ref name=\":0\" /> Boxer does a large share of the physical labour on the farm. He is shown to hold the belief that \"Napoleon is always right.\" At one point, he had challenged Squealer's statement that Snowball was always against the welfare of the farm, earning him an attack from Napoleon's dogs. But Boxer's immense strength repels the attack, worrying the pigs that their authority can be challenged. Boxer has been compared to [[Alexey Stakhanov]], a diligent and enthusiastic role model of the [[Stakhanovite movement]].{{sfn|Rodden|1999|p=12}} He has been described as \"faithful and strong\";{{sfn|Sutherland|2005|pp=17\u201319}} he believes any problem can be solved if he works harder.{{sfn|Roper|1977|pp=11\u201363}} When Boxer is injured, Napoleon sells him to a local [[knacker]] to buy himself whisky, and Squealer gives a moving account, falsifying Boxer's death.\n* Mollie \u2013 A self-centred, self-indulgent and vain young white mare who quickly leaves for another farm after the revolution, in a manner similar to those who left Russia after the fall of the Tsar.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/animalfarm/characters/|title=Animal Farm Characters|last=SparkNotes Editors.|date=2007|website=SparkNotes|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=December 7, 2019}}</ref> She is only once mentioned again.\n* Clover \u2013 A gentle, caring mare, who shows concern especially for Boxer, who often pushes himself too hard. Clover can read all the letters of the alphabet, but cannot \"put words together\". She seems to catch on to the sly tricks and schemes set up by Napoleon and Squealer.\n* [[Benjamin (Animal Farm)|Benjamin]] \u2013 A donkey, one of the oldest, wisest animals on the farm, and one of the few who can read properly. He is sceptical, temperamental and cynical: his most frequent remark is, \"Life will go on as it has always gone on\u2014that is, badly.\"  The academic Morris Dickstein has suggested there is \"a touch of Orwell himself in this creature's timeless scepticism\"{{sfn|Dickstein |2007| |p=141}} and indeed, friends called Orwell \"Donkey George\", \"after his grumbling donkey Benjamin, in ''Animal Farm''.\"{{sfn|Orwell|2006 |p=236}}\n\n===Other animals===\n* Muriel \u2013 A wise old goat who is friends with all of the animals on the farm. Similarly to Benjamin, Muriel is one of the few animals on the farm who is not a pig but can read.\n* The puppies \u2013 Offspring of Jessie and Bluebell, the puppies were taken away at birth by Napoleon and raised by him to serve as his powerful security force.\n* Moses \u2013 The Raven, \"Mr. Jones's especial pet, was a spy and a tale-bearer, but he was also a clever talker.\"{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} Initially following Mrs. Jones into exile, he reappears several years later and resumes his role of talking but not working. He regales Animal Farm's denizens with tales of a wondrous place beyond the clouds called \"Sugarcandy Mountain, that happy country where we poor animals shall rest forever from our labours!\" Orwell portrays [[Religion and politics|established religion]] as \"the black raven of priestcraft\u2014promising pie in the sky when you die, and faithfully serving whoever happens to be in power.\" Napoleon brings the Raven back (Ch. IX), as Stalin brought back the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].{{sfn|Dickstein|2007|p= 141}}\n* The sheep \u2013 They show limited understanding of Animalism and the political atmosphere of the farm, yet nonetheless they are the voice of blind conformity{{sfn|Dickstein|2007|p=141}} as they bleat their support Napoleon's ideals with jingles during his speeches and meetings with Snowball. Their constant bleating of \"four legs good, two legs bad\" was used as a device to drown out any opposition or alternate views from Snowball, much as Stalin used hysterical crowds to drown out Trotsky.{{sfn|Meyers|1975|p=122}} Towards the latter section of the book, Squealer (the propagandist) trains the sheep to alter their slogan to \"four legs good, two legs better,\" which they dutifully do.\n* The hens \u2013 The hens are promised at the start of the revolution that they will get to keep their eggs, which are stolen from them under Mr. Jones. However, their eggs are soon taken from them under the premise of buying goods from outside Animal Farm. The hens are among the first to rebel, albeit unsuccessfully, against Napoleon.\n* The cows \u2013 The cows are enticed into the revolution by promises that their milk will not be stolen, but can be used to raise their own calves. Their milk is then stolen by the pigs, who learn to milk them. The milk is stirred into the pigs' mash every day, while the other animals are denied such luxuries.\n* The cat \u2013 Never seen to carry out any work, the cat is absent for long periods and is forgiven because her excuses are so convincing and she \"purred so affectionately that it was impossible not to believe in her good intentions.\"{{sfn|Orwell|2009|p=52}}  She has no interest in the politics of the farm, and the only time she is recorded as having participated in an election, she is found to have actually \"voted on both sides.\"{{sfn|Orwell|2009|p=25}}\n\n== Genre/Style ==\nGeorge Orwell's ''Animal Farm'' is an example of a political satire that was intended to have a \"wider application,\" according to Orwell himself, in terms of its relevance.<ref name=\":22\">{{Cite journal|last=Dwan|first=David|date=2012|title=Orwell's Paradox: Equality in ''Animal Farm''|journal=ELH|volume=79|issue=3|pages=655\u201383|doi=10.1353/elh.2012.0025|issn=1080-6547}}</ref> Stylistically, the work shares many similarities with some of Orwell's other works, most notably ''1984,'' as both have been considered works of Swiftian Satire.<ref name=\":32\">{{Cite journal|last=Crick|first=Bernard|date=December 31, 1983|title=The real message of '1984': Orwell's Classic Re-assessed |url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/document-view?p=AWNB&docref=news/1139870DADC7F880|journal=Financial Times|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Furthermore, these two prominent works seem to suggest Orwell's bleak view of the future for humanity; he seems to stress the potential/current threat of dystopias similar to those in ''Animal Farm'' and ''1984''.<ref name=\":42\">{{Cite web|url=https://rosariomariocapalbo.wordpress.com/2011/04/10/george-orwell-dystopian-novel-1984-animal-farm/|title=George Orwell: Dystopian Novel \u2013 1984 \u2013 Animal Farm |last=rosariomario|date=2011-04-10|website=Spazio personale di mario aperto a tutti 24 ore su|language=en|access-date=2019-11-26}}</ref> In these kinds of works, Orwell distinctly references the disarray and traumatic conditions of Europe following the Second World War.<ref name=\":52\">{{Cite journal|last=Orwell|first=George|date=|title=Politics and the English Language|journal=Literary Cavalcade|volume=54|pages=20\u201326|id={{ProQuest|210475382}}}}</ref> Orwell's style and writing philosophy as a whole was very concerned with the pursuit of truth in writing.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=KnowledgeNotes|date=1996|title=Animal Farm|journal=Signet Classic|volume=|pages=|id={{ProQuest|2137893954}}}}</ref> Orwell was committed to communicating in a way that was straightforward, given the way that he felt words were commonly used in politics to deceive and confuse.<ref name=\":02\" /> For this reason, he is careful, in ''Animal Farm'', to make sure the narrator speaks in an unbiased and uncomplicated fashion.<ref name=\":02\" /> The difference is seen in the way that the animals speak and interact, as the generally moral animals seem to speak their minds clearly, while the wicked animals on the farm, such as Napoleon, twist language in such a way that it meets their own insidious desires.<ref name=\":02\" /> This style reflects Orwell's close proximation to the issues facing Europe at the time and his determination to comment critically on Stalin's Soviet Russia.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Origin ===\nGeorge Orwell wrote the manuscript in 1943 and 1944 after his experiences during the [[Spanish Civil War]], which he described in ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'' (1938). In the preface of a 1947 Ukrainian edition of ''Animal Farm'', he explained how escaping the communist purges in Spain taught him \"how easily totalitarian propaganda can control the opinion of enlightened people in democratic countries.\"{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} This motivated Orwell to expose and strongly condemn what he saw as the [[Stalinist]] corruption of the original socialist ideals.{{sfn|Orwell|1947|p=}} ''Homage to Catalonia'' sold poorly; after seeing [[Arthur Koestler]]'s best-selling, ''[[Darkness at Noon]],'' about the same war, Orwell decided that fiction was the best way to describe totalitarianism.{{r|dalrymple20190824}}\n\nImmediately prior to writing the book, Orwell had quit the [[BBC]]. He was also upset about a booklet for propagandists the Ministry of Information had put out. The booklet included instructions on how to quell ideological fears of the Soviet Union, such as directions to claim that the Red Terror was a figment of Nazi imagination.{{sfn|Overy |1997 |p=297}}\n\nIn the preface, Orwell described the source of the idea of setting the book on a farm:{{sfn|Orwell|1947|p=}}\n{{quote\n|...I saw a little boy, perhaps ten years old, driving a huge carthorse along a narrow path, whipping it whenever it tried to turn. It struck me that if only such animals became aware of their strength we should have no power over them, and that men exploit animals in much the same way as the rich exploit the proletariat.\n}}\n\n==Publication==\n\n===Publishing===\nOrwell initially encountered difficulty getting the manuscript published, largely due to fears that the book might upset the alliance between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Four publishers refused to publish ''Animal Farm'', yet one had initially accepted the work, but declined it after consulting the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]].{{sfn|Freedom of the Press}}{{efn|[[#GOIT|Orwell 1976 p. 25 ''La libert\u00e0 di stampa'']]}} Eventually, [[Secker and Warburg]] published the first edition in 1945.\n\nDuring the [[World War II|Second World War]], it became clear to Orwell that anti-Soviet literature was not something which most major publishing houses would touch\u2014including his regular publisher [[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz]]. He also submitted the manuscript to [[Faber and Faber]], where the poet [[T. S. Eliot]] (who was a director of the firm) rejected it; Eliot wrote back to Orwell praising the book's \"good writing\" and \"fundamental integrity\", but declared that they would only accept it for publication if they had some sympathy for the viewpoint \"which I take to be generally [[Deformed workers' state|Trotskyite]]\". Eliot said he found the view \"not convincing\", and contended that the pigs were made out to be the best to run the farm; he posited that someone might argue \"what was needed... was not more communism but more public-spirited pigs\".{{sfn|Eliot|1969}} Orwell let [[Andr\u00e9 Deutsch]], who was working for Nicholson & Watson in 1944, read the typescript, and Deutsch was convinced that Nicholson & Watson would want to publish it; however, they did not, and \"lectured Orwell on what they perceived to be errors in ''Animal Farm''.\"{{sfn|Orwell |2013|p= 231}} In his ''London Letter'' on 17 April 1944 for ''[[Partisan Review]]'', Orwell wrote that it was \"now next door to impossible to get anything overtly anti-Russian printed. Anti-Russian books do appear, but mostly from Catholic publishing firms and always from a religious or frankly reactionary angle.\"\n\nThe publisher [[Jonathan Cape]], who had initially accepted ''Animal Farm'', subsequently rejected the book after an official at the British Ministry of Information warned him off{{sfn|Whitewashing of Stalin |2008}}\u2014although the civil servant who it is assumed gave the order was later found to be a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spy.{{sfn|Taylor|2003|p=337}} Writing to [[Leonard Moore (literary agent)|Leonard Moore]], a partner in the literary agency of Christy & Moore, publisher Jonathan Cape explained that the decision had been taken on the advice of a senior official in the Ministry of Information. Such flagrant anti-Soviet bias was unacceptable, and the choice of pigs as the dominant class was thought to be especially offensive. It may reasonably be assumed that the \"important official\" was a man named [[Peter Smollett]], who was later unmasked as a Soviet agent.{{sfn| Leab  |2007 |p= 3}}  Orwell was suspicious of Smollett/Smolka, and he would be one of the names Orwell [[Orwell's list|included in his list]] of Crypto-Communists and Fellow-Travellers sent to the [[Information Research Department]] in 1949. The publisher wrote to Orwell, saying:{{sfn|Whitewashing of Stalin |2008}}\n{{quote |\nIf the fable were addressed generally to dictators and dictatorships at large then publication would be all right, but the fable does follow, as I see now, so completely the progress of the Russian Soviets and their two dictators [Lenin and Stalin], that it can apply only to Russia, to the exclusion of the other dictatorships.\n\nAnother thing: it would be less offensive if the predominant caste in the fable were not pigs. I think the choice of pigs as the ruling caste will no doubt give offence to many people, and particularly to anyone who is a bit touchy, as undoubtedly the Russians are.\n}}\n\n[[Frederic Warburg]] also faced pressures against publication, even from people in his own office and from his wife Pamela, who felt that it was not the moment for ingratitude towards Stalin and the heroic [[Red Army]],{{sfn|Fyvel|1982 |p=139}} which had [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|played a major part]] in defeating [[Adolf Hitler]]. A Russian translation was printed in the paper ''Posev'', and in giving permission for a Russian translation of ''Animal Farm'', Orwell refused in advance all royalties. A translation in Ukrainian, which was produced in Germany, was confiscated in large part by the American wartime authorities and handed over to the Soviet repatriation commission.{{efn|[[Struve, Gleb]]. ''Telling the Russians'', written for the Russian journal ''New Russian Wind'', reprinted in Remembering Orwell |pp=260\u201361}}\n\nIn October 1945, Orwell wrote to Frederic Warburg expressing interest in pursuing the possibility that the political cartoonist [[David Low (cartoonist)|David Low]] might illustrate ''Animal Farm''. Low had written a letter saying that he had had \"a good time with ''ANIMAL FARM''\u2014an excellent bit of satire\u2014it would illustrate perfectly.\" Nothing came of this, and a trial issue produced by Secker & Warburg in 1956 illustrated by John Driver was abandoned, but the [[Folio Society]] published an edition in 1984 illustrated by [[Quentin Blake]] and an edition illustrated by the cartoonist [[Ralph Steadman]] was published by Secker & Warburg in 1995 to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the first edition of ''Animal Farm''.{{sfn|Orwell|2001|p= 123 }}{{sfn|Orwell|2015|pp= 313\u201314}}\n\n===Preface===\nOrwell originally wrote a preface complaining about British [[self-censorship]] and how the British people were suppressing criticism of the USSR, their World War II ally:\n{{quote|The sinister fact about literary censorship in England is that it is largely voluntary.... Things are kept right out of the British press, not because the Government intervenes but because of a general tacit agreement that 'it wouldn't do' to mention that particular fact.}}\nAlthough the first edition allowed space for the preface, it was not included,{{sfn|Freedom of the Press}} and as of June 2009 most editions of the book have not included it.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nSecker and Warburg published the first edition of ''Animal Farm'' in 1945 without an introduction. However, the publisher had provided space for a preface in the author's proof composited from the manuscript. For reasons unknown, no preface was supplied, and the page numbers had to be renumbered at the last minute.{{sfn|Freedom of the Press}}\n\nIn 1972, [[Ian Angus (librarian)|Ian Angus]] found the original typescript titled \"The Freedom of the Press\", and [[Bernard Crick]] published it, together with his own introduction, in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' on 15 September 1972 as \"How the essay came to be written\".{{sfn|Freedom of the Press}}  Orwell's essay criticised British self-censorship by the press, specifically the suppression of unflattering descriptions of Stalin and the Soviet government.{{sfn|Freedom of the Press}} The same essay also appeared in the Italian 1976 edition of ''Animal Farm'' with another introduction by Crick, claiming to be the first edition with the preface. Other publishers were still declining to publish it.{{Clarify|date=March 2010|reason=more details needed, were some actively refusing, unaware of the preface?}}\n\n==Reception==\nContemporary reviews of the work were not universally positive. Writing in the American ''[[The New Republic|New Republic]]'' magazine, George Soule expressed his disappointment in the book, writing that it \"puzzled and saddened me. It seemed on the whole dull. The allegory turned out to be a creaking machine for saying in a clumsy way things that have been said better directly.\" Soule believed that the animals were not consistent enough with their real-world inspirations, and said, \"It seems to me that the failure of this book (commercially it is already assured of tremendous success) arises from the fact that the satire deals not with something the author has experienced, but rather with stereotyped ideas about a country which he probably does not know very well\".{{sfn|Soule|1946}}\n\n''[[The Guardian]]'' on 24 August 1945 called ''Animal Farm'' \"a delightfully humorous and caustic satire on the rule of the many by the few\".{{sfn|Books of day|1945}}  [[Tosco Fyvel]], writing in ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]'' on the same day, called the book \"a gentle satire on a certain State and on the illusions of an age which may already be behind us.\" [[Julian Symons]] responded, on 7 September, \"Should we not expect, in ''Tribune'' at least, acknowledgement of the fact that it is a satire not at all gentle upon a particular State\u2014Soviet Russia? It seems to me that a reviewer should have the courage to identify Napoleon with Stalin, and Snowball with Trotsky, and express an opinion favourable or unfavourable to the author, upon a political ground. In a hundred years time perhaps, ''Animal Farm'' may be simply a fairy story, today it is a political satire with a good deal of point.\" ''Animal Farm'' has been subject to much comment in the decades since these early remarks.{{sfn|Orwell | 2015|p= 253}}\n\nThe [[CIA]] from 1952 to 1957 in Operation Aedinosaur sent millions of balloons carrying copies of the novel into Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia, whose air forces tried to shoot the balloons down.<ref name=\"dalrymple20190824\">{{Cite magazine |last=Dalrymple |first=William |author-link=William Dalrymple (historian) |title=Novel explosives of the Cold War |url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2019/08/novel-explosives-of-the-cold-war/ |magazine=The Spectator |archive-url=https://outline.com/X9SnJv |archive-date=2019-08-26}}</ref>\n\n''Time'' magazine chose ''Animal Farm'' as one of the 100 best English-language novels (1923 to 2005);{{sfn|Grossman|Lacayo|2005|p=}} it also featured at number 31 on the [[Modern Library List of Best 20th-Century Novels]].{{Sfn|Modern Library|1998}} It won a [[Retro-Hugo|Retrospective Hugo Award]] in 1996 and is included in the [[Great Books of the Western World]] selection.<ref name=\"Western books\"/>\n\nPopular reading in schools, a 2016 UK poll saw ''Animal Farm'' ranked the nation's favourite book from school.<ref>{{cite news |title=George Orwell's Animal Farm tops list of the nation's favourite books from school |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/george-orwells-animal-farm-tops-list-of-the-nations-favourite-books-from-school-a6994351.html |accessdate=15 December 2019 |work=The Independent}}</ref>\n\n''Animal Farm'' has also faced an array of challenges in school settings around the US.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/advocacy/bbooks/frequentlychallengedbooks/classics|title=Banned & Challenged Classics|last=admin|date=2013-03-26|website=Advocacy, Legislation & Issues|language=en|access-date=2019-11-26}}</ref> The following are examples of this controversy that has existed around Orwell's work:\n* The [[John Birch Society]] in Wisconsin challenged the reading of ''Animal Farm'' in 1965 because of its reference to masses revolting.<ref name=\":1\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bannedlibrary.com/podcast/2017/1/22/animal-farm-and-other-books-not-meant-for-children|title=Animal Farm by George Orwell|website=Banned Library|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-15}}</ref>\n* New York State English Council's Committee on Defense Against Censorship found that in 1968 ''Animal Farm'' had been widely deemed a \"problem book.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n* A censorship survey conducted in DeKalb County, Georgia regarding the years 1979\u20131982, revealed that many schools had attempted to limit access to ''Animal Farm'' due to its \"political theories.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Superintendent in Bay County, Florida bans ''Animal Farm'' at the middle school and high school levels in 1987.<ref name=\":1\" />\n** The Board quickly brought back the book, however, after receiving complains of the ban as \"unconstitutional\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n* ''Animal Farm'' was removed from a school district's curriculum in 2017 in Stonington, Connecticut.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=1991|title=Water availability and quality from the stratified drift in Anguilla Brook basin, Stonington and North Stonington, Connecticut|doi=10.3133/wri854276|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1908948ab340182a75e7d5d5e74e373ddff5c29a}}</ref>\n\n''Animal Farm'' has also faced similar forms of resistance in other countries.<ref name=\":1\"/> The ALA also mentions the way that the book was prevented from being featured at the International Book Fair in Moscow, Russia, in 1977 and banned from schools in the United Arab Emirates for references to practices or actions that defy Arab or Islamic beliefs, such as pigs or alcohol.<ref name=\":1\"/>  In the same manner, ''Animal Farm'' has also faced relatively recent issues in China.

The changed commandments are as follows, with the changes bolded:\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>No animal shall sleep in a bed '''with sheets'''.</li>\n<li>No animal shall drink alcohol '''to excess'''.</li>\n<li>No animal shall kill any other animal '''without cause'''.</li>\n</ol>\nEventually, these are replaced with the maxims, \"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others\", and \"Four legs good, two legs better\" as the pigs become more human. This is an [[Irony|ironic]] twist to the original purpose of the Seven Commandments, which were supposed to keep order within Animal Farm by uniting the animals together against the humans and preventing animals from following the humans' evil habits. Through the revision of the commandments, Orwell demonstrates how simply political [[dogma]] can be turned into malleable [[propaganda]].{{sfn|Carr|2010|pp=78\u201379}}\n\n===Significance and allegory===\n[[File:Flag_of_the_Animal_Farm.svg|thumb|left|The Horn and Hoof flag described in the book appears to be based on the [[hammer and sickle]], the Communist symbol. By the end of the book, the Hoof and Horn is removed.]]\nOrwell biographer Jeffrey Meyers has written, \"virtually every detail has political significance in this allegory.\"{{sfn|Meyers|1975|p=249}} Orwell himself wrote in 1946, \"Of course I intended it primarily as a satire on the Russian revolution... [and] ''that kind'' of revolution (violent conspiratorial revolution, led by unconsciously power-hungry people) can only lead to a change of masters [-] revolutions only effect a radical improvement when the masses are alert.\"{{sfn|Orwell|2013|page=334}} In a preface for a 1947 Ukrainian edition, he stated, \"...&nbsp;for the past ten years I have been convinced that the destruction of the Soviet myth was essential if we wanted a revival of the socialist movement.

Orwell had the publisher alter this to \"All the animals except Napoleon\" in recognition of Stalin's decision to remain in Moscow during the German advance.{{sfn|Meyers| 1975 |p=142}} Orwell requested the change after he met Joseph Czapski in Paris in March 1945. Czapski, a survivor of the [[Katyn Massacre]] and an opponent of the Soviet regime, told Orwell, as Orwell wrote to [[Arthur Koestler]], that it had been \"the character [and] greatness of Stalin\" that saved Russia from the German invasion.{{efn|A Note on the Text, Peter Davison, ''Animal Farm'', Penguin edition 1989 |p=xx}}\n\n[[File:15th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks).jpg|thumb|Front row (left to right): [[Alexey Rykov|Rykov]], [[Mykola Skrypnyk|Skrypnyk]], and [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] \u2013 'When Snowball comes to the crucial points in his speeches he is drowned out by the sheep (Ch.

Seventy years ago, a child might have been told that masturbation would cause insanity, acne, sterility, or other such nonsense. \"Self-abuse,\" as it was then called, has enjoyed a long and unfortunate history of religious and medical disapproval (Caroll, 2013). The modern view is that masturbation is a normal sexual behavior (Hogarth & Ingham, 2009). Enlightened parents are well aware of this fact. Still, many children are punished or made to feel guilty for touching their genitals. This is unfortunate because masturbation itself is harmless. Typically, its only negative effects are feelings of fear, guilt, or anxiety that arise from learning to think of masturbation as \"bad\" or \"wrong.\" In an age when people are urged to practice \"[[safer sex]],\" masturbation remains the safest sex of all.}}</ref><ref name=\"Sigel2004\">{{cite journal|last=Sigel|first=Lisa Z.|date=Summer 2004|title=Masturbation: The History of the Great Terror by Jean Stengers; Ann Van Neck; Kathryn Hoffmann|journal=Journal of Social History|volume=37|series= |issue=4|pages=1065\u20131066|issn=0022-4529|accessdate=|quote=Stengers and Van Neck follow the illness to its fairly abrupt demise; they liken the shift to finally seeing the emperor without clothes as doctors began to doubt masturbation as a cause of illness at the turn of the twentieth century.

The implications were clear: if most people masturbated and did not experience insanity, debility, and early death, then masturbation could not be held accountable to the etiology that had been assigned it.

Seventy years ago, a child might have been told that masturbation would cause insanity, acne, sterility, or other such nonsense. \"Self-abuse,\" as it was then called, has enjoyed a long and unfortunate history of religious and medical disapproval (Caroll, 2013). The modern view is that masturbation is a normal sexual behavior (Hogarth & Ingham, 2009). Enlightened parents are well aware of this fact. Still, many children are punished or made to feel guilty for touching their genitals. This is unfortunate because masturbation itself is harmless. Typically, its only negative effects are feelings of fear, guilt, or anxiety that arise from learning to think of masturbation as \"bad\" or \"wrong.\" In an age when people are urged to practice \"[[safer sex]],\" masturbation remains the safest sex of all.}}</ref><ref name=\"Sigel2004\">{{cite journal|last=Sigel|first=Lisa Z.|date=Summer 2004|title=Masturbation: The History of the Great Terror by Jean Stengers; Ann Van Neck; Kathryn Hoffmann|journal=Journal of Social History|volume=37|series= |issue=4|pages=1065\u20131066|issn=0022-4529|accessdate=|quote=Stengers and Van Neck follow the illness to its fairly abrupt demise; they liken the shift to finally seeing the emperor without clothes as doctors began to doubt masturbation as a cause of illness at the turn of the twentieth century.

{"title_page": "List of goat breeds", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\nThis is a '''list of goat breeds'''. There are many recognized [[breed]]s of [[domestic goat]] ''(Capra aegagrus hircus)''. Goat breeds (especially [[dairy]] goats) are some of the oldest defined animal breeds for which [[breed standard]]s and production records have been kept. [[Selective breeding]] of goats generally focuses on improving production of [[fiber]], meat, dairy products or [[goatskin (material)|goatskin]]. Breeds are generally classified based on their primary use, though there are several breeds which are considered dual- or multi-purpose.\n\n==List==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"

The [[Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe]] and the [[Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head]] in [[Massachusetts]] are Federally recognized, and the Herring Pond Wampanoag Tribe, Namasket (or Nemasket) Pokanoket Band, and Pocasset Wampanoag Tribe (Pokonoket) are recognized by the State of Massachusetts.</ref> {{cite web |title=The Commonwealth of Massachusetts' Commission on Indian Affairs |They lived in southeastern Massachusetts and [[Rhode Island]] in the beginning of the 17th century, at the time of first contact with the English colonists, a territory that included the islands of [[Martha's Vineyard]] and [[Nantucket]]. Their population numbered in the thousands; 3,000 Wampanoag lived on Martha's Vineyard alone.\n\nFrom 1615 to 1619, the Wampanoag suffered an epidemic, long suspected to be [[smallpox]]. Modern research, however, has suggested that it may have been [[leptospirosis]], a bacterial infection which can develop into [[Weil's syndrome]]. It caused a high fatality rate and decimated the Wampanoag population. Researchers suggest that the losses from the epidemic were so large that colonists were able to establish their settlements in the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] more easily.<ref>[https://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/16/2/281.htm  Marr JS, Cathey JT. \"New hypothesis for cause of an epidemic among Native Americans, New England, 1616\u20131619\"], ''Emerging Infectious Diseases,'' Centers for Disease Control, 2010 Feb {{doi|10.3201/edi1602.090276}}</ref> More than 50 years later, [[King Philip's War]] (1675\u20131676) of Indian allies against the colonists resulted in the death of 40 percent of the surviving tribe. Many male Wampanoag were sold into slavery in [[Bermuda]] or the [[West Indies]], and some women and children were enslaved by colonists in [[New England]].\n\nThe tribe largely disappeared from historical records after the late 18th century, although its people and descendants persisted. Survivors continued to live in their traditional areas and maintained many aspects of their culture, while absorbing other peoples by marriage and adapting to changing economic and cultural needs in the larger society.

The women cultivated varieties of the \"[[Three Sisters (agriculture)|three sisters]]\" (maize, climbing beans, and squash) as the staples of their diet, supplemented by fish and game caught by the men.<ref name=\"hosm\" /> Each community had authority over a well-defined territory from which the people derived their livelihood through a seasonal round of fishing, planting, harvesting, and hunting. Southern New England was populated by various tribes, so hunting grounds had strictly defined boundaries.\n\nThe Wampanoag had a [[matrilineal]] system, like many [[indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands]], in which women controlled property, and hereditary status was passed through the maternal line. They were also [[matrifocal]]; when a young couple married, they lived with the woman's family. Women elders could approve selection of chiefs or sachems. Men acted in most of the political roles for relations with other bands and tribes, as well as warfare. Women passed plots of land to their female descendants, regardless of their marital status.<ref>Plane, Anne Marie. ''Colonial Intimacies: Indian Marriage in Early New England''. (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press), 2000: 20, 61.</ref>\n\nThe production of food among the Wampanoag was similar to that of many American Indian societies, and food habits were divided along gender lines. Men and women had specific tasks. Women played an active role in many of the stages of food production, so they had important socio-political, economic, and spiritual roles in their communities.<ref name=\"HNAI\">''Handbook of North American Indians.''</ref> Wampanoag men were mainly responsible for hunting and fishing, while women took care of farming and gathering wild fruits, nuts, berries, and shellfish.<ref>See Bragdon, Kathleen, \"Gender as a Social Category in Native Southern New England,\" ''Ethnohistory'' 43:4, 1996, p. 576, and Plane, ''Colonial Intimacies,'' p. 20.</ref> Women were responsible for up to 75 percent of all food production in Wampanoag societies.<ref>Plane, ''Colonial Intimacies,'' p. 20.</ref><ref name=\"hosm\" />\n\nThe Wampanoag were organized into a confederation where a head sachem presided over a number of other sachems. The colonists often referred to him as \"king\", but the position of a sachem differed in many ways from a king. They were selected by women elders and were bound to consult their own councilors within their tribe, as well as any of the \"petty sachems\" in the region.<ref>Plane, ''Colonial Intimacies,'' p. 23.</ref> They were also responsible for arranging trade privileges, as well as protecting their allies in exchange for material tribute.<ref>Salisbury, Neal.

Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution, pp. 171f</ref>\n\nPre-marital sexual experimentation was accepted, although the Wampanoag expected fidelity within unions after marriage. [[Roger Williams]] (1603\u20131683) stated that \"single fornication they count no sin, but after Marriage\u2026 they count it heinous for either of them to be false.\"<ref>Williams, Roger.

Some elite men could take several wives for political or social reasons, and multiple wives were a symbol of wealth because women were the producers and distributors of corn and other food products. Marriage and conjugal unions were not as important as ties of clan and kinship.\n\n==Language revival==\n[[File:Eliot Bible.jpg|200px|thumb|Title page of the first Bible printed in the United States, translated in the Massachusett language by [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]]]]\nThe Wampanoag originally spoke W\u00f4pan\u00e2ak, a dialect of the [[Massachusett language]] which belongs to the [[Algonquian languages]] family.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} The [[Mamusse Wunneetupantamwe Um Biblum God|first Bible published in America]] was a 1663 translation into Wampanoag by missionary [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]]. He created an orthography which he taught to the Wampanoag. Many became literate, using Wampanoag for letters, deeds, and historic documents.<ref name=\"Mifflin\"/>\n\nThe rapid decline of Wampanoag speakers began after the [[American Revolution]]. Neal Salisbury and Colin G. Calloway suggest that New England Indian communities suffered from gender imbalances at this time due to premature male deaths, especially due to warfare and their work in whaling and shipping. They posit that many Wampanoag women married outside their linguistic groups, making it difficult for them to maintain the various Wampanoag dialects.<ref>Salisbury, Neal and Colin G. Calloway, eds.

The ''W\u00f4pan\u00e2ak'' (Wampanoag) Language Reclamation Project is a collaboration of several tribes and bands led by [[Jessie Little Doe Baird]].

Captain Thomas Hunt captured several Wampanoag in 1614 and sold them in Spain as slaves. A [[Patuxet]] named [[Tisquantum]] (or [[Squanto]]) was bought by Spanish monks who attempted to convert him before setting him free. He accompanied an expedition to Newfoundland as an interpreter, then made his way back to his homeland in 1619\u2014only to discover that the entire Patuxet tribe had died in an epidemic.<ref name=\"DWI\">''Die Welt der Indianer.''</ref>\n\nIn 1620, the [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]] arrived in [[Plymouth, Massachusetts|Plymouth]], and Tisquantum and other Wampanoag taught them how to cultivate the varieties of corn, squash, and beans (the [[Three Sisters (agriculture)|Three Sisters]]) that flourished in New England, as well as how to catch and process fish and collect seafood. They enabled the Pilgrims to survive their first winters, and Squanto lived with them and acted as a middleman between them and ''[[Massasoit]]'', the Wampanoag [[sachem]].\n\nThe Wampanoag suffered from an epidemic between 1616 and 1619, long thought to be smallpox introduced by contact with Europeans. However, researchers published a study in 2010 suggesting that the epidemic was [[leptospirosis]], or 7-day fever.<ref name=\"Marr JS, Cathey JT 281\u20136\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Marr JS, Cathey JT |title=New hypothesis for cause of an epidemic among Native Americans, New England, 1616\u20131619 |journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases |volume=16 |issue=2 |date=February 2010 |doi=10.3201/eid1602.090276 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/16/2/281.htm |pages=281\u20136 |pmid=20113559 |pmc=2957993 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130082204/http://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/16/2/281.htm |archivedate=30 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The groups most devastated by the illness were those who had traded heavily with the French, leading to speculation that the disease was a [[virgin soil epidemic]].

In 1632, the [[Narragansett people|Narragansetts]] attacked Massasoit's village in ''[[Warren, Rhode Island|Sowam]]'', but the colonists helped the Wampanoag to drive them back.<ref name=\"DWI\" />\n\n[[File:Plymouthkolonie.jpg|thumb|Seal of Plymouth Colony]]\n\nAfter 1630, the members of Plymouth Colony became outnumbered by the growing number of Puritans settling around Boston. The colonists expanded westward into the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. In 1637, they destroyed the powerful [[Pequot]] Confederation. In 1643, the [[Mohegan]]s defeated the Narragansetts in a war with support from the colonists, and they became the dominant tribe in southern New England.<ref name=\"DWI\" />\n\n=== Conversion to Christianity ===\nAfter 1650, [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]] and other Puritan missionaries sought to convert Indians to Christianity, and the converted Indians settled in 14 \"praying towns.\" Eliot and his colleagues hoped that the Indians would adopt practices such as monogamous marriage, agriculture, and jurisprudence.<ref>Plane, ''Colonial Intimacies,'' pp. 47\u201348.</ref> The high levels of epidemics among the Indians may have motivated some conversions. Salisbury suggests that the survivors suffered a type of spiritual crisis because their medical and religious leaders had been unable to prevent the epidemic losses.<ref>Salisbury, ''Manitou and Providence,'' p. 106.</ref> By the latter half of the seventeenth century, alcoholism had become rampant among Indian men. Many turned for help to Christianity and Christian discipline systems. Christianity also became a refuge for women from drunkenness, with its insistence upon temperance and systems of retribution for drunkenness.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n[[File:Old Indian Meetinghouse.jpg|thumb|right|\"[[Old Indian Meeting House]]\" built in 1684 in [[Mashpee, Massachusetts]], the oldest Indian church building in the United States]]\n\nIndividual towns and regions had differing expectations for Indian conversions. In most of Eliot's mainland \"praying towns,\" religious converts were also expected to follow colonial laws and manners, and to adopt the material trappings of colonial life. Eliot and other ministers relied on praise and rewards for those who conformed, rather than punishing those who did not.<ref>Plane, ''Colonial Intimacies,'' p. 48.</ref> The Christian Indian settlements of [[Martha's Vineyard]] were noted for a great deal of sharing and mixing between Wampanoag and colonial ways of life. Wampanoag converts often continued their traditional practices in dress, hairstyle, and governance. The Martha's Vineyard converts were not required to attend church and they often maintained traditional cultural practices, such as mourning rituals.<ref>Ronda, James P. \"Generations of Faith: The Christian Indians of Martha\u2019s Vineyard\", ''William and Mary Quarterly 38'', 1981, p. 378.</ref>\n\nThe Wampanoag women were more likely to convert to Christianity than the men. [[Experience Mayhew]] said that \"it seems to be a Truth with respect to our Indians, so far as my knowledge of them extend, that there have been, and are a greater number of their Women appearing pious than of the men among them\" in his text \"Indian Converts\".<ref>Quoted from James Ronda, ''Generations of Faith,'' p. 384\u201388</ref> The frequency of female conversion created a problem for missionaries, who wanted to establish patriarchal family and societal structures among them. Women had control of property, and inheritance and descent passed through their line, including hereditary leadership for men. Wampanoag women on Martha's Vineyard were the spiritual leaders of their households. In general, English ministers agreed that it was preferable for women to subvert the patriarchal model and assume a dominant spiritual role than it was for their husbands to remain unconverted. Experience Mayhew asked, \"How can those Wives answer it unto God who do not Use their utmost Endeavors to Perswade and oblige their husbands to maintain Prayer in their families?\"<ref>Experience Mayhew, sermon, \"Family Religion Excited and Assisted,\" 1714\u201328, quoted from Plane, ''Colonial Intimacies,'' p. 114</ref> In some cases, Wampanoag women converts accepted changed gender roles under colonial custom, while others practiced their traditional roles of shared power as Christians.\n\n=== Metacomet (King Philip) ===\n\n[[File:Philip King of Mount Hope by Paul Revere.jpeg|thumb|right|''Philip, King of Mount Hope'', 1772, by [[Paul Revere]]]]\nMassasoit was among those Indians who adopted colonial customs. He asked the legislators in Plymouth near the end of his life to give both of his sons English names. The older son [[Wamsutta]] was given the name Alexander, and his younger brother [[Metacom]] was named Philip. After his father's death, Alexander became the sachem of the Wampanoag. The colonists invited him to Plymouth to talk, but Wamsutta became seriously ill on the way home and died shortly after. The Wampanoag were told that he died of fever, but many Indians thought that he had been poisoned. The following year, his brother Philip (Metacom) became sachem of the Wampanoag.<ref name=\"hist\">[http://www.tolatsga.org/wampa.html Wampanoag History]</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2018}}\n\nUnder Philip's leadership, the relationship changed dramatically between the Wampanoag and the colonists. Philip believed that the ever-increasing colonists would eventually take over everything\u2014not only land, but also their culture, their way of life, and their religion, and he decided to limit the further expansion of colonial settlements. The Wampanoag numbered only 1,000, and Philip began to visit other tribes to build alliances among those who also wanted to push out the colonists. At that time, the number of colonists in southern New England already numbered more than double that of the Indians\u201435,000 vs. 15,000. In 1671, Philip was called to [[Taunton, Massachusetts]] where he listened to the accusations of the colonists and signed an agreement that required the Wampanoag to give up their firearms. To be on the safe side, he did not take part in the subsequent dinner. His men never delivered their weapons.<ref name=\"hist\" />{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2018}}\n\nPhilip gradually gained the [[Nipmuck]], [[Pocomtuc]], and Narragansett as allies, and the beginning of the uprising was first planned for the spring of 1676. In March 1675, however, [[John Sassamon]] was murdered.<ref>For a much more detailed examination of John Sassamon, his murder, and its effects on King Philip's War, see Jill Lepore's ''The Name of War''.</ref> Sassamon was a Christian Indian raised in Natick, one of the \"praying towns.\" He was educated at [[Harvard College]] and had served as a scribe, interpreter, and counselor to Philip and the Wampanoag. But, a week before his death, Sassamon reported to Plymouth governor [[Josiah Winslow]] that Philip was planning a war against the colonists.\n\nSassamon was found dead under the ice of Assawompsett Pond a week later; three Wampanoag warriors were accused of his murder by a Christian Indian and taken captive by the colonists; they were hanged in June 1675 after a trial by a jury of 12 colonists and six Christian Indians. This execution was a catalyst for war, combined with rumors that the colonists wanted to capture Philip. Philip called a council of war on Mount Hope; most Wampanoag wanted to follow him, with the exception of the [[Nauset]] on [[Cape Cod]] and the small groups on the offshore islands. Allies included the Nipmuck, Pocomtuc, and some [[Pennacook]] and eastern [[Abenaki]] from farther north. The Narragansett remained neutral at the beginning of the war.<ref>Salisbury, Introduction to ''Mary Rowlandson,'' p. 21.</ref>\n\n=== King Philip's War ===\n{{Main|King Philip's War}}\nOn June 20, 1675, some Wampanoags attacked colonists in [[Swansea, Massachusetts]] and laid siege to the town; they destroyed it completely five days later, leading ultimately to [[King Philip's War]]. The united tribes in southern New England attacked 52 of 90 colonial settlements, and partially burned them down.<ref name=\"hist\" />\n\nAt the outbreak of the war, many Indians offered to fight with the colonists against King Philip and his allies, serving as warriors, scouts, advisers, and spies. Mistrust and hostility eventually caused the colonists to discontinue Indian assistance, even though they were invaluable in the war. The Massachusetts government moved many Christian Indians to [[Deer Island (Massachusetts)|Deer Island]] in [[Boston Harbor]], in part to protect the \"praying Indians\" from vigilantes, but also as a precautionary measure to prevent rebellion and sedition from them.<ref>Salisbury, Introduction to Mary Rowlandson, p. 23.</ref> [[Mary Rowlandson]]'s [[A Narrative of the Captivity and Restoration of Mrs. Mary Rowlandson|''The Sovereignty and Goodness of God'']] is an account of her months of captivity by the Wampanoag during King Philip's War in which she expressed shock at the cruelties from Christian Indians.<ref>See Mary Rowlandson, The Sovereignty and Goodness of God, pp. 75 and 98.</ref>\n\nFrom Massachusetts, the war spread to other parts of New England. The Kennebec, Pigwacket ([[Pequawket]]s), and [[Androscoggin people|Arosaguntacook]] from Maine joined in the war against the colonists. The Narragansetts of [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]] gave up their neutrality after the colonists attacked one of their fortified villages. The Narragansetts lost more than 600 people and 20 sachems in the battle which became known as the \"[[Great Swamp Massacre]]\". Their leader Canonchet was able to flee and led a large group of Narragansett warriors west to join King Philip's warriors.<ref name=\"hist\" />\n\nThe war turned against Philip in the spring of 1676, following a winter of hunger and deprivation. The colonial troops set out after him, and Canonchet was taken captive and executed by a firing squad. Canonchet's corpse was quartered, and his head was sent to [[Hartford, Connecticut]] to be put on public display.<ref name=\"hist\" />\n\nDuring the summer months, Philip escaped from his pursuers and went to a hideout on [[Mount Hope (Rhode Island)|Mount Hope]] in Rhode Island. Colonial forces attacked in August, killing and capturing 173 Wampanoags. Philip barely escaped capture, but his wife and their nine-year-old son were captured and put on a ship at Plymouth; they were then sold as slaves in the [[West Indies]]. On August 12, 1676, colonial troops surrounded Philip's camp, and soon shot and killed him.\n\n=== Consequences of the war ===\nWith the death of Philip and most of their leaders, the Wampanoags were nearly exterminated; only about 400 survived the war. The Narragansetts and [[Nipmuck]]s suffered similar rates of losses, and many small tribes in southern New England were finished. In addition, many Wampanoag were sold into slavery. Male captives were generally sold to slave traders and transported to the West Indies, [[Bermuda]], [[Virginia]], or the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. The colonists used the women and children as slaves or indentured servants in New England, depending on the colony. Massachusetts resettled the remaining Wampanoags in [[Natick]], Wamesit, Punkapoag, and Hassanamesit, four of the original 14 praying towns. These were the only ones to be resettled after the war.<ref>Salisbury, Introduction to Mary Rowlandson, p. 37.</ref> Overall, approximately 5,000 Indians (40 percent of their population) and 2,500 colonists (5 percent) were killed in King Philip's War.<ref>Salisbury, Introduction to Mary Rowlandson, p. 1.</ref>\n\n===18th to 20th century===\n\n==== Mashpee ====\nThe exception to relocation was the coastal islands' Wampanoag groups, who had stayed neutral through the war.  The colonists forced the Wampanoag of the mainland to resettle with the Saconnet (Sekonnet), or with the [[Nauset]] into the praying towns in [[Barnstable County, Massachusetts|Barnstable County]]. [[Mashpee, Massachusetts|Mashpee]] is the largest [[Indian reservation|reservation]] set aside in Massachusetts, and is located on [[Cape Cod]]. In 1660, the colonists allotted the Indians about {{convert|50|sqmi|km2}} there, and beginning in 1665 they had self-government, adopting an English-style court of law and trials. The area was integrated into the district of Mashpee in 1763.\n\nIn 1788 after the [[American Revolutionary War]], the state revoked the Wampanoag ability to self-govern, considering it a failure. It appointed a supervisory committee consisting of five European-American members, with no Wampanoag.  In 1834, the state returned a certain degree of self-government to the First Nations People, and although the First Nations People were far from autonomous, they continued in this manner.  To support assimilation, in 1842 the state violated the [[Nonintercourse Act]] when it illegally allocated plots from {{convert|2000|acre|km2}} of their communal {{convert|13000|acre|km2}}, to be distributed in {{convert|60|acre|m2|adj=on}} parcels to each household for subsistence farming, although New England communities were adopting other types of economies.  The state passed laws to try to control white encroachment on the reservation; some stole wood from its forests. A large region, once rich in wood, fish and game, it was considered highly desirable by the whites. With competition between whites and the Wampanoag, conflicts were more frequent than for more isolated Indian settlements elsewhere in the state.\n\n==== Wampanoag on Martha's Vineyard ====\nOn Martha's Vineyard in the 18th and 19th centuries, there were three reservations\u2014[[Chappaquiddick Island|Chappaquiddick]], Christiantown and [[Gay Head]]. The Chappaquiddick Reservation was part of a small island of the same name and was located on the eastern point of that island. As the result of the sale of land in 1789, the Indians lost valuable areas, and the remaining land was distributed among the Indian residents in 1810. In 1823 the laws were changed, in order to hinder those trying to get rid of the Indians and to implement a visible beginning of a civic organization. Around 1849, they owned {{convert|692|acre|km2}} of infertile land, and many of the residents moved to nearby [[Edgartown, Massachusetts|Edgartown]], so that they could practice a trade and obtain some civil rights.<ref name=\"HNAIff\">''Handbook of North American Indians.'' Chapter: Indians of Southern New England and Long Island, late period, pp. 178ff; [http://www.seaconkewampanoagtribe.org Seaconke Wampanoag Tribe webpage]; [http://mashpeewampanoagtribe.com/ Mashpee Wampanoag Nation webpage]; [http://www.wampanoagtribe.org Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head Aquinnah webpage]</ref>\n\nChristiantown was originally a \"praying town\" on the northwest side of Martha's Vineyard, northwest of [[Tisbury, Massachusetts|Tisbury]]. In 1849 the reservation still consisted of {{convert|390|acre|km2}}, of which all but 10 were distributed among the residents. The land, kept under community ownership, yielded very few crops and the tribe members left it to get paying jobs in the cities. Wampanoag [[oral history]] tells that Christiantown was wiped out in 1888 by a [[smallpox]] epidemic.<ref name=\"HNAIff\" />\n\nThe third reservation on Martha's Vineyard was constructed in 1711 by the [[New England Company]] (founded in 1649) to Christianize the Indians. They bought land for the Gay Head Indians who had lived there since before 1642. There was considerable dispute about how the land should be cultivated, as the colony had leased the better sections to the whites at low interest. The original goal of creating an undisturbed center for missionary work was quickly forgotten. The state finally created a reservation on a peninsula on the western point of Martha's Vineyard and named it Gay Head. This region was connected to the main island by an isthmus; it enabled the isolation desired by the Wampanoag. In 1849 they had {{convert|2400|acre|km2}} there, of which 500 acres were distributed among the tribe members. The rest was communal property. In contrast to the other reservation groups, the tribe had no guardian or headman. When they needed advice on legal questions, they asked the guardian of the Chappaquiddick Reservation, but other matters they handled themselves. The band used [[usufruct]] title, meaning that members had no legal claim to their land and allowed the tribal members free rein over their choice of land, as well as over cultivation and building, in order to make their ownership clear. They did not allow whites to settle on their land.  They made strict laws regulating membership in the tribe. As a result, they were able to strengthen the groups' ties to each other, and they did not lose their tribal identity until long after other groups had lost theirs.<ref name=\"HNAIff\" />\n\nThe Wampanoag on [[Nantucket Island]] were almost completely destroyed by an unknown [[plague (disease)|plague]] in 1763; the last Nantucket Wampanoag died in 1855.<ref name=\"HNAIff\" />\n\n==Current status==\n[[File:Plimoth Plantation Native American Wigwam.jpg|thumb|right|Wampanoag educator at [[Plimoth Plantation]]]]\nSlightly more than 2,000 Wampanoag are counted as enrolled members of the nation today (many have ancestry including other tribes and races), and many live near the [[Indian reservation|reservation]] (Watuppa Wampanoag Reservation) on Martha's Vineyard, in [[Dukes County, Massachusetts|Dukes County]]. It is located in the town of [[Aquinnah, Massachusetts|Aquinnah]] (formerly known as Gay Head), at the extreme western part of the island. It has a land area of {{convert|1.952|km2|acre}}, and a [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]] resident population of 91 persons.\n\nSeveral bands of the Wampanoag have organized governments: Aquinnah of Gay Head, Assonet, Herring Pond, Mashpee, Pocasset, Pokonoket and Seekonk. Only the Aquinnah and Mashpee bands have gained federal recognition, although the other bands are recognized by the state of Massachusetts and have also applied for federal recognition as tribes.\n\nSome genealogy experts testified that the tribes did not demonstrate the required continuity since historic times.  For instance, in his testimony to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the historian Francis Hutchins said that the Mashpee \"were not an Indian tribe in the years 1666, 1680, 1763, 1790, 1834, 1870, and 1970, or at any time between 1666 and 1970 (Day 36, 130\u2013140). In his opinion, an Indian tribe was \"an entity composed of persons of American Indian descent, which entity possesses distinct political, legal, cultural attributes, which attributes have descended directly from aboriginal precursors.\" (Day 36, 124). Without accounting for cultural change, adaptation, and the effects of non-Indian society, Hutchins argued the Mashpee were not an Indian tribe historically because they adopted Christianity and non-Indian forms of dress and appearance, and chose to remain in Massachusetts as \"second-class\" citizens rather than emigrating westward (note: to Indian Territory) to \"resume tribal existence.\" Hutchins also noted that they intermarried with non-Indians to create a \"non-white,\" or \"colored,\" community (Day 36, 130\u2013140). Hutchins appeared to require unchanged culture, including maintenance of a traditional religion and essentially total social autonomy from non-Indian society.\"<ref>[http://mashpeewampanoagtribe.com/mashpee_final_determination.pdf \"Testimony of Historian Francis Hutchins\"], ''Mashpee Wampanoag Final Determination,'' 2007.</ref>\n\n=== Wampanoag federally recognized tribes ===\n\n==== Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head (Aquinnah) ====\n{{Main|Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head}}\n[[File:WampanoagWhaler.jpg|thumb|right|Amos Hoskins, an Aquinnah Wampanoag Whaling Captain]]\nThe Aquinnah (''\"land under the hill\"''<ref>[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BG&p_theme=bg&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EADDCA7494773F9&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM ''Boston Globe'', May 15, 1997]</ref><ref>[http://www.cradleboard.org/cnat/profiles/wanpanoag.htm \"Wampanoag\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200624/http://www.cradleboard.org/cnat/profiles/wanpanoag.htm |date=October 29, 2013 }} ''[[Cradleboard Teaching Project]]''.

Their population numbered in the thousands; 3,000 Wampanoag lived on Martha's Vineyard alone.\n\nFrom 1615 to 1619, the Wampanoag suffered an epidemic, long suspected to be [[smallpox]]. Modern research, however, has suggested that it may have been [[leptospirosis]], a bacterial infection which can develop into [[Weil's syndrome]].

Survivors continued to live in their traditional areas and maintained many aspects of their culture, while absorbing other peoples by marriage and adapting to changing economic and cultural needs in the larger society.

They were also [[matrifocal]]; when a young couple married, they lived with the woman's family. Women elders could approve selection of chiefs or sachems. Men acted in most of the political roles for relations with other bands and tribes, as well as warfare. Women passed plots of land to their female descendants, regardless of their marital status.<ref>Plane, Anne Marie. ''Colonial Intimacies: Indian Marriage in Early New England''. (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press), 2000: 20, 61.</ref>\n\nThe production of food among the Wampanoag was similar to that of many American Indian societies, and food habits were divided along gender lines. Men and women had specific tasks. Women played an active role in many of the stages of food production, so they had important socio-political, economic, and spiritual roles in their communities.<ref name=\"HNAI\">''Handbook of North American Indians.''</ref> Wampanoag men were mainly responsible for hunting and fishing, while women took care of farming and gathering wild fruits, nuts, berries, and shellfish.<ref>See Bragdon, Kathleen, \"Gender as a Social Category in Native Southern New England,\" ''Ethnohistory'' 43:4, 1996, p. 576, and Plane, ''Colonial Intimacies,'' p. 20.</ref> Women were responsible for up to 75 percent of all food production in Wampanoag societies.<ref>Plane, ''Colonial Intimacies,'' p. 20.</ref><ref name=\"hosm\" />\n\nThe Wampanoag were organized into a confederation where a head sachem presided over a number of other sachems. The colonists often referred to him as \"king\", but the position of a sachem differed in many ways from a king. They were selected by women elders and were bound to consult their own councilors within their tribe, as well as any of the \"petty sachems\" in the region.<ref>Plane, ''Colonial Intimacies,'' p. 23.</ref> They were also responsible for arranging trade privileges, as well as protecting their allies in exchange for material tribute.<ref>Salisbury, Neal.

Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution, pp. 171f</ref>\n\nPre-marital sexual experimentation was accepted, although the Wampanoag expected fidelity within unions after marriage. [[Roger Williams]] (1603\u20131683) stated that \"single fornication they count no sin, but after Marriage\u2026 they count it heinous for either of them to be false.\"<ref>Williams, Roger.

Some elite men could take several wives for political or social reasons, and multiple wives were a symbol of wealth because women were the producers and distributors of corn and other food products. Marriage and conjugal unions were not as important as ties of clan and kinship.\n\n==Language revival==\n[[File:Eliot Bible.jpg|200px|thumb|Title page of the first Bible printed in the United States, translated in the Massachusett language by [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]]]]\nThe Wampanoag originally spoke W\u00f4pan\u00e2ak, a dialect of the [[Massachusett language]] which belongs to the [[Algonquian languages]] family.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} The [[Mamusse Wunneetupantamwe Um Biblum God|first Bible published in America]] was a 1663 translation into Wampanoag by missionary [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]].

Many became literate, using Wampanoag for letters, deeds, and historic documents.<ref name=\"Mifflin\"/>\n\nThe rapid decline of Wampanoag speakers began after the [[American Revolution]]. Neal Salisbury and Colin G. Calloway suggest that New England Indian communities suffered from gender imbalances at this time due to premature male deaths, especially due to warfare and their work in whaling and shipping. They posit that many Wampanoag women married outside their linguistic groups, making it difficult for them to maintain the various Wampanoag dialects.<ref>Salisbury, Neal and Colin G. Calloway, eds.

The ''W\u00f4pan\u00e2ak'' (Wampanoag) Language Reclamation Project is a collaboration of several tribes and bands led by [[Jessie Little Doe Baird]].

Captain Thomas Hunt captured several Wampanoag in 1614 and sold them in Spain as slaves. A [[Patuxet]] named [[Tisquantum]] (or [[Squanto]]) was bought by Spanish monks who attempted to convert him before setting him free. He accompanied an expedition to Newfoundland as an interpreter, then made his way back to his homeland in 1619\u2014only to discover that the entire Patuxet tribe had died in an epidemic.<ref name=\"DWI\">''Die Welt der Indianer.''</ref>\n\nIn 1620, the [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]] arrived in [[Plymouth, Massachusetts|Plymouth]], and Tisquantum and other Wampanoag taught them how to cultivate the varieties of corn, squash, and beans (the [[Three Sisters (agriculture)|Three Sisters]]) that flourished in New England, as well as how to catch and process fish and collect seafood. They enabled the Pilgrims to survive their first winters, and Squanto lived with them and acted as a middleman between them and ''[[Massasoit]]'', the Wampanoag [[sachem]].\n\nThe Wampanoag suffered from an epidemic between 1616 and 1619, long thought to be smallpox introduced by contact with Europeans. However, researchers published a study in 2010 suggesting that the epidemic was [[leptospirosis]], or 7-day fever.<ref name=\"Marr JS, Cathey JT 281\u20136\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Marr JS, Cathey JT |title=New hypothesis for cause of an epidemic among Native Americans, New England, 1616\u20131619 |journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases |volume=16 |issue=2 |date=February 2010 |doi=10.3201/eid1602.090276 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/16/2/281.htm |pages=281\u20136 |pmid=20113559 |pmc=2957993 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130082204/http://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/16/2/281.htm |archivedate=30 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The groups most devastated by the illness were those who had traded heavily with the French, leading to speculation that the disease was a [[virgin soil epidemic]].

Many American Indians argue against the romanticized story of the Wampanoag celebrating together with the colonists.

In 1632, the [[Narragansett people|Narragansetts]] attacked Massasoit's village in ''[[Warren, Rhode Island|Sowam]]'', but the colonists helped the Wampanoag to drive them back.<ref name=\"DWI\" />\n\n[[File:Plymouthkolonie.jpg|thumb|Seal of Plymouth Colony]]\n\nAfter 1630, the members of Plymouth Colony became outnumbered by the growing number of Puritans settling around Boston. The colonists expanded westward into the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. In 1637, they destroyed the powerful [[Pequot]] Confederation. In 1643, the [[Mohegan]]s defeated the Narragansetts in a war with support from the colonists, and they became the dominant tribe in southern New England.<ref name=\"DWI\" />\n\n=== Conversion to Christianity ===\nAfter 1650, [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]] and other Puritan missionaries sought to convert Indians to Christianity, and the converted Indians settled in 14 \"praying towns.\" Eliot and his colleagues hoped that the Indians would adopt practices such as monogamous marriage, agriculture, and jurisprudence.<ref>Plane, ''Colonial Intimacies,'' pp. 47\u201348.</ref> The high levels of epidemics among the Indians may have motivated some conversions. Salisbury suggests that the survivors suffered a type of spiritual crisis because their medical and religious leaders had been unable to prevent the epidemic losses.<ref>Salisbury, ''Manitou and Providence,'' p. 106.</ref> By the latter half of the seventeenth century, alcoholism had become rampant among Indian men. Many turned for help to Christianity and Christian discipline systems. Christianity also became a refuge for women from drunkenness, with its insistence upon temperance and systems of retribution for drunkenness.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n[[File:Old Indian Meetinghouse.jpg|thumb|right|\"[[Old Indian Meeting House]]\" built in 1684 in [[Mashpee, Massachusetts]], the oldest Indian church building in the United States]]\n\nIndividual towns and regions had differing expectations for Indian conversions. In most of Eliot's mainland \"praying towns,\" religious converts were also expected to follow colonial laws and manners, and to adopt the material trappings of colonial life. Eliot and other ministers relied on praise and rewards for those who conformed, rather than punishing those who did not.<ref>Plane, ''Colonial Intimacies,'' p. 48.</ref> The Christian Indian settlements of [[Martha's Vineyard]] were noted for a great deal of sharing and mixing between Wampanoag and colonial ways of life. Wampanoag converts often continued their traditional practices in dress, hairstyle, and governance. The Martha's Vineyard converts were not required to attend church and they often maintained traditional cultural practices, such as mourning rituals.<ref>Ronda, James P. \"Generations of Faith: The Christian Indians of Martha\u2019s Vineyard\", ''William and Mary Quarterly 38'', 1981, p. 378.</ref>\n\nThe Wampanoag women were more likely to convert to Christianity than the men. [[Experience Mayhew]] said that \"it seems to be a Truth with respect to our Indians, so far as my knowledge of them extend, that there have been, and are a greater number of their Women appearing pious than of the men among them\" in his text \"Indian Converts\".<ref>Quoted from James Ronda, ''Generations of Faith,'' p. 384\u201388</ref> The frequency of female conversion created a problem for missionaries, who wanted to establish patriarchal family and societal structures among them. Women had control of property, and inheritance and descent passed through their line, including hereditary leadership for men. Wampanoag women on Martha's Vineyard were the spiritual leaders of their households. In general, English ministers agreed that it was preferable for women to subvert the patriarchal model and assume a dominant spiritual role than it was for their husbands to remain unconverted. Experience Mayhew asked, \"How can those Wives answer it unto God who do not Use their utmost Endeavors to Perswade and oblige their husbands to maintain Prayer in their families?\"<ref>Experience Mayhew, sermon, \"Family Religion Excited and Assisted,\" 1714\u201328, quoted from Plane, ''Colonial Intimacies,'' p. 114</ref> In some cases, Wampanoag women converts accepted changed gender roles under colonial custom, while others practiced their traditional roles of shared power as Christians.\n\n=== Metacomet (King Philip) ===\n\n[[File:Philip King of Mount Hope by Paul Revere.jpeg|thumb|right|''Philip, King of Mount Hope'', 1772, by [[Paul Revere]]]]\nMassasoit was among those Indians who adopted colonial customs. He asked the legislators in Plymouth near the end of his life to give both of his sons English names. The older son [[Wamsutta]] was given the name Alexander, and his younger brother [[Metacom]] was named Philip. After his father's death, Alexander became the sachem of the Wampanoag. The colonists invited him to Plymouth to talk, but Wamsutta became seriously ill on the way home and died shortly after. The Wampanoag were told that he died of fever, but many Indians thought that he had been poisoned. The following year, his brother Philip (Metacom) became sachem of the Wampanoag.<ref name=\"hist\">[http://www.tolatsga.org/wampa.html Wampanoag History]</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2018}}\n\nUnder Philip's leadership, the relationship changed dramatically between the Wampanoag and the colonists. Philip believed that the ever-increasing colonists would eventually take over everything\u2014not only land, but also their culture, their way of life, and their religion, and he decided to limit the further expansion of colonial settlements. The Wampanoag numbered only 1,000, and Philip began to visit other tribes to build alliances among those who also wanted to push out the colonists. At that time, the number of colonists in southern New England already numbered more than double that of the Indians\u201435,000 vs. 15,000. In 1671, Philip was called to [[Taunton, Massachusetts]] where he listened to the accusations of the colonists and signed an agreement that required the Wampanoag to give up their firearms. To be on the safe side, he did not take part in the subsequent dinner. His men never delivered their weapons.<ref name=\"hist\" />{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2018}}\n\nPhilip gradually gained the [[Nipmuck]], [[Pocomtuc]], and Narragansett as allies, and the beginning of the uprising was first planned for the spring of 1676. In March 1675, however, [[John Sassamon]] was murdered.<ref>For a much more detailed examination of John Sassamon, his murder, and its effects on King Philip's War, see Jill Lepore's ''The Name of War''.</ref> Sassamon was a Christian Indian raised in Natick, one of the \"praying towns.\" He was educated at [[Harvard College]] and had served as a scribe, interpreter, and counselor to Philip and the Wampanoag. But, a week before his death, Sassamon reported to Plymouth governor [[Josiah Winslow]] that Philip was planning a war against the colonists.\n\nSassamon was found dead under the ice of Assawompsett Pond a week later; three Wampanoag warriors were accused of his murder by a Christian Indian and taken captive by the colonists; they were hanged in June 1675 after a trial by a jury of 12 colonists and six Christian Indians. This execution was a catalyst for war, combined with rumors that the colonists wanted to capture Philip. Philip called a council of war on Mount Hope; most Wampanoag wanted to follow him, with the exception of the [[Nauset]] on [[Cape Cod]] and the small groups on the offshore islands. Allies included the Nipmuck, Pocomtuc, and some [[Pennacook]] and eastern [[Abenaki]] from farther north. The Narragansett remained neutral at the beginning of the war.<ref>Salisbury, Introduction to ''Mary Rowlandson,'' p. 21.</ref>\n\n=== King Philip's War ===\n{{Main|King Philip's War}}\nOn June 20, 1675, some Wampanoags attacked colonists in [[Swansea, Massachusetts]] and laid siege to the town; they destroyed it completely five days later, leading ultimately to [[King Philip's War]]. The united tribes in southern New England attacked 52 of 90 colonial settlements, and partially burned them down.<ref name=\"hist\" />\n\nAt the outbreak of the war, many Indians offered to fight with the colonists against King Philip and his allies, serving as warriors, scouts, advisers, and spies. Mistrust and hostility eventually caused the colonists to discontinue Indian assistance, even though they were invaluable in the war. The Massachusetts government moved many Christian Indians to [[Deer Island (Massachusetts)|Deer Island]] in [[Boston Harbor]], in part to protect the \"praying Indians\" from vigilantes, but also as a precautionary measure to prevent rebellion and sedition from them.<ref>Salisbury, Introduction to Mary Rowlandson, p. 23.</ref> [[Mary Rowlandson]]'s [[A Narrative of the Captivity and Restoration of Mrs. Mary Rowlandson|''The Sovereignty and Goodness of God'']] is an account of her months of captivity by the Wampanoag during King Philip's War in which she expressed shock at the cruelties from Christian Indians.<ref>See Mary Rowlandson, The Sovereignty and Goodness of God, pp. 75 and 98.</ref>\n\nFrom Massachusetts, the war spread to other parts of New England. The Kennebec, Pigwacket ([[Pequawket]]s), and [[Androscoggin people|Arosaguntacook]] from Maine joined in the war against the colonists. The Narragansetts of [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]] gave up their neutrality after the colonists attacked one of their fortified villages. The Narragansetts lost more than 600 people and 20 sachems in the battle which became known as the \"[[Great Swamp Massacre]]\". Their leader Canonchet was able to flee and led a large group of Narragansett warriors west to join King Philip's warriors.<ref name=\"hist\" />\n\nThe war turned against Philip in the spring of 1676, following a winter of hunger and deprivation. The colonial troops set out after him, and Canonchet was taken captive and executed by a firing squad. Canonchet's corpse was quartered, and his head was sent to [[Hartford, Connecticut]] to be put on public display.<ref name=\"hist\" />\n\nDuring the summer months, Philip escaped from his pursuers and went to a hideout on [[Mount Hope (Rhode Island)|Mount Hope]] in Rhode Island. Colonial forces attacked in August, killing and capturing 173 Wampanoags. Philip barely escaped capture, but his wife and their nine-year-old son were captured and put on a ship at Plymouth; they were then sold as slaves in the [[West Indies]]. On August 12, 1676, colonial troops surrounded Philip's camp, and soon shot and killed him.\n\n=== Consequences of the war ===\nWith the death of Philip and most of their leaders, the Wampanoags were nearly exterminated; only about 400 survived the war. The Narragansetts and [[Nipmuck]]s suffered similar rates of losses, and many small tribes in southern New England were finished. In addition, many Wampanoag were sold into slavery. Male captives were generally sold to slave traders and transported to the West Indies, [[Bermuda]], [[Virginia]], or the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. The colonists used the women and children as slaves or indentured servants in New England, depending on the colony. Massachusetts resettled the remaining Wampanoags in [[Natick]], Wamesit, Punkapoag, and Hassanamesit, four of the original 14 praying towns. These were the only ones to be resettled after the war.<ref>Salisbury, Introduction to Mary Rowlandson, p. 37.</ref> Overall, approximately 5,000 Indians (40 percent of their population) and 2,500 colonists (5 percent) were killed in King Philip's War.<ref>Salisbury, Introduction to Mary Rowlandson, p. 1.</ref>\n\n===18th to 20th century===\n\n==== Mashpee ====\nThe exception to relocation was the coastal islands' Wampanoag groups, who had stayed neutral through the war.  The colonists forced the Wampanoag of the mainland to resettle with the Saconnet (Sekonnet), or with the [[Nauset]] into the praying towns in [[Barnstable County, Massachusetts|Barnstable County]]. [[Mashpee, Massachusetts|Mashpee]] is the largest [[Indian reservation|reservation]] set aside in Massachusetts, and is located on [[Cape Cod]]. In 1660, the colonists allotted the Indians about {{convert|50|sqmi|km2}} there, and beginning in 1665 they had self-government, adopting an English-style court of law and trials. The area was integrated into the district of Mashpee in 1763.\n\nIn 1788 after the [[American Revolutionary War]], the state revoked the Wampanoag ability to self-govern, considering it a failure. It appointed a supervisory committee consisting of five European-American members, with no Wampanoag.  In 1834, the state returned a certain degree of self-government to the First Nations People, and although the First Nations People were far from autonomous, they continued in this manner.  To support assimilation, in 1842 the state violated the [[Nonintercourse Act]] when it illegally allocated plots from {{convert|2000|acre|km2}} of their communal {{convert|13000|acre|km2}}, to be distributed in {{convert|60|acre|m2|adj=on}} parcels to each household for subsistence farming, although New England communities were adopting other types of economies.  The state passed laws to try to control white encroachment on the reservation; some stole wood from its forests. A large region, once rich in wood, fish and game, it was considered highly desirable by the whites. With competition between whites and the Wampanoag, conflicts were more frequent than for more isolated Indian settlements elsewhere in the state.\n\n==== Wampanoag on Martha's Vineyard ====\nOn Martha's Vineyard in the 18th and 19th centuries, there were three reservations\u2014[[Chappaquiddick Island|Chappaquiddick]], Christiantown and [[Gay Head]]. The Chappaquiddick Reservation was part of a small island of the same name and was located on the eastern point of that island. As the result of the sale of land in 1789, the Indians lost valuable areas, and the remaining land was distributed among the Indian residents in 1810. In 1823 the laws were changed, in order to hinder those trying to get rid of the Indians and to implement a visible beginning of a civic organization. Around 1849, they owned {{convert|692|acre|km2}} of infertile land, and many of the residents moved to nearby [[Edgartown, Massachusetts|Edgartown]], so that they could practice a trade and obtain some civil rights.<ref name=\"HNAIff\">''Handbook of North American Indians.'' Chapter: Indians of Southern New England and Long Island, late period, pp. 178ff; [http://www.seaconkewampanoagtribe.org Seaconke Wampanoag Tribe webpage]; [http://mashpeewampanoagtribe.com/ Mashpee Wampanoag Nation webpage]; [http://www.wampanoagtribe.org Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head Aquinnah webpage]</ref>\n\nChristiantown was originally a \"praying town\" on the northwest side of Martha's Vineyard, northwest of [[Tisbury, Massachusetts|Tisbury]]. In 1849 the reservation still consisted of {{convert|390|acre|km2}}, of which all but 10 were distributed among the residents. The land, kept under community ownership, yielded very few crops and the tribe members left it to get paying jobs in the cities. Wampanoag [[oral history]] tells that Christiantown was wiped out in 1888 by a [[smallpox]] epidemic.<ref name=\"HNAIff\" />\n\nThe third reservation on Martha's Vineyard was constructed in 1711 by the [[New England Company]] (founded in 1649) to Christianize the Indians. They bought land for the Gay Head Indians who had lived there since before 1642. There was considerable dispute about how the land should be cultivated, as the colony had leased the better sections to the whites at low interest. The original goal of creating an undisturbed center for missionary work was quickly forgotten. The state finally created a reservation on a peninsula on the western point of Martha's Vineyard and named it Gay Head. This region was connected to the main island by an isthmus; it enabled the isolation desired by the Wampanoag. In 1849 they had {{convert|2400|acre|km2}} there, of which 500 acres were distributed among the tribe members. The rest was communal property. In contrast to the other reservation groups, the tribe had no guardian or headman. When they needed advice on legal questions, they asked the guardian of the Chappaquiddick Reservation, but other matters they handled themselves. The band used [[usufruct]] title, meaning that members had no legal claim to their land and allowed the tribal members free rein over their choice of land, as well as over cultivation and building, in order to make their ownership clear. They did not allow whites to settle on their land.  They made strict laws regulating membership in the tribe. As a result, they were able to strengthen the groups' ties to each other, and they did not lose their tribal identity until long after other groups had lost theirs.<ref name=\"HNAIff\" />\n\nThe Wampanoag on [[Nantucket Island]] were almost completely destroyed by an unknown [[plague (disease)|plague]] in 1763; the last Nantucket Wampanoag died in 1855.<ref name=\"HNAIff\" />\n\n==Current status==\n[[File:Plimoth Plantation Native American Wigwam.jpg|thumb|right|Wampanoag educator at [[Plimoth Plantation]]]]\nSlightly more than 2,000 Wampanoag are counted as enrolled members of the nation today (many have ancestry including other tribes and races), and many live near the [[Indian reservation|reservation]] (Watuppa Wampanoag Reservation) on Martha's Vineyard, in [[Dukes County, Massachusetts|Dukes County]]. It is located in the town of [[Aquinnah, Massachusetts|Aquinnah]] (formerly known as Gay Head), at the extreme western part of the island. It has a land area of {{convert|1.952|km2|acre}}, and a [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]] resident population of 91 persons.\n\nSeveral bands of the Wampanoag have organized governments: Aquinnah of Gay Head, Assonet, Herring Pond, Mashpee, Pocasset, Pokonoket and Seekonk. Only the Aquinnah and Mashpee bands have gained federal recognition, although the other bands are recognized by the state of Massachusetts and have also applied for federal recognition as tribes.\n\nSome genealogy experts testified that the tribes did not demonstrate the required continuity since historic times.  For instance, in his testimony to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the historian Francis Hutchins said that the Mashpee \"were not an Indian tribe in the years 1666, 1680, 1763, 1790, 1834, 1870, and 1970, or at any time between 1666 and 1970 (Day 36, 130\u2013140). In his opinion, an Indian tribe was \"an entity composed of persons of American Indian descent, which entity possesses distinct political, legal, cultural attributes, which attributes have descended directly from aboriginal precursors.\" (Day 36, 124). Without accounting for cultural change, adaptation, and the effects of non-Indian society, Hutchins argued the Mashpee were not an Indian tribe historically because they adopted Christianity and non-Indian forms of dress and appearance, and chose to remain in Massachusetts as \"second-class\" citizens rather than emigrating westward (note: to Indian Territory) to \"resume tribal existence.\" Hutchins also noted that they intermarried with non-Indians to create a \"non-white,\" or \"colored,\" community (Day 36, 130\u2013140). Hutchins appeared to require unchanged culture, including maintenance of a traditional religion and essentially total social autonomy from non-Indian society.\"<ref>[http://mashpeewampanoagtribe.com/mashpee_final_determination.pdf \"Testimony of Historian Francis Hutchins\"], ''Mashpee Wampanoag Final Determination,'' 2007.</ref>\n\n=== Wampanoag federally recognized tribes ===\n\n==== Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head (Aquinnah) ====\n{{Main|Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head}}\n[[File:WampanoagWhaler.jpg|thumb|right|Amos Hoskins, an Aquinnah Wampanoag Whaling Captain]]\nThe Aquinnah (''\"land under the hill\"''<ref>[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BG&p_theme=bg&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EADDCA7494773F9&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM ''Boston Globe'', May 15, 1997]</ref><ref>[http://www.cradleboard.org/cnat/profiles/wanpanoag.htm \"Wampanoag\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200624/http://www.cradleboard.org/cnat/profiles/wanpanoag.htm |date=October 29, 2013 }} ''[[Cradleboard Teaching Project]]''.

He became notorious as \"Bloody Bonner\" for his role in the persecution of [[heresy|heretics]] under the Catholic government of [[Mary I of England]], and ended his life as a prisoner under [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]].\n\n==Early life==\nBonner was the son of Elizabeth Frodsham, who was married to Edmund Bonner, a [[Sawyer (occupation)|sawyer]] of [[Hanley, Worcestershire]]. [[John Strype]] printed an account, with many circumstantial details, stating that Bonner was the natural son of George Savage, [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of [[Davenham]], Cheshire, and that his mother married Bonner only after the future bishop's birth.<ref>J.

After the fall of Wolsey he remained faithful to him and was with him at the time of his arrest at [[Cawood]] and death at [[Leicester]] in 1530. Subsequently, he was transferred, perhaps through Cromwell's influence, to the service of the king, and in January 1532 he was sent to [[Rome]] as the king's agent when the question of the king's divorce was raised. There he sought to obstruct the judicial proceedings against Henry in the [[Roman Curia|papal curia]].{{sfn|Pollard|1911|p=210}}\n\nIn October 1533 he was entrusted with the task of suggesting to [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]] (while he was the guest of [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] at [[Marseille]]) Henry's appeal from the pope to a general council; but there seems to be no good authority for [[Gilbert Burnet]]'s story that Clement threatened to have him burnt alive. For these and other services Bonner had been rewarded by successive grants of the livings of Cherry Burton ([[Yorkshire|Yorks]]), Ripple ([[Worcestershire|Worcester]]), [[Blaydon]] ([[County Durham|Durham]]), and [[East Dereham]] ([[Norfolk]]). In 1535, he was made [[List of Archdeacons of Leicester|Archdeacon of Leicester]].{{sfn|Pollard|1911|p=210}}\n\nDuring the following years he was much employed on important embassies in the king's interests, first to the pope to appeal against the excommunication pronounced in July 1533, afterwards to the [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] to dissuade him from attending the general council which the pope wished to summon at [[Vicenza]]. Towards the end of 1535 he was sent to further what he called \"the cause of the Gospel\" (''Letters and Papers'', 1536, No. 469) in North [[Germany]]; and in 1536 he wrote a preface to [[Stephen Gardiner]]'s ''De vera Obedientia'', which asserted the royal and denied the papal  supremacy, and was received with delight by the [[Martin Luther|Lutherans]]. After a brief embassy to the Emperor in the spring of 1538, Bonner succeeded [[Stephen Gardiner|Gardiner]] as ambassador to the French Court in [[Paris]]. In this capacity he proved capable and successful, though irritation was frequently caused by his overbearing and dictatorial manner. He began his mission by sending Cromwell a long list of accusations against his predecessor. He was almost as bitter against [[Thomas Wyatt (poet)|Wyatt]] and Mason, whom he denounced as a \"papist\", and the violence of his conduct led [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] to threaten him with a hundred strokes of the halberd. He seems, however, to have pleased his patron, Cromwell, and perhaps Henry, by his energy in seeing the king's \"Great\" Bible in English through the press in Paris. He was already king's chaplain; his appointment at Paris had been accompanied by promotion to the [[See of Hereford]] (27 November 1538) but owing to his absence he could neither be consecrated nor take possession of his see, and he was still abroad when he was translated to the Bishopric of London (October 1539).{{sfn|Pollard|1911|p=210}} Bonner returned to England and was consecrated 4 April 1540.\n\nHitherto Bonner had had a reputation as a somewhat coarse and unscrupulous tool of Cromwell &ndash; a sort of ecclesiastical [[Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton|Wriothesley]], he is not known to have protested against any of the changes effected by his masters; he professed to be no theologian, and was in the habit, when asked technical questions, to refer his interrogators to the theologians. He had graduated in law, and not in theology. There was nothing in the Reformation to appeal to him, except the repudiation of papal control; and he was one of those numerous Englishmen whose views were faithfully reflected in Henry's Act of the [[Six Articles (1539)|Six Articles]].{{sfn|Pollard|1911|p=210}} Indeed, almost his first duty as Bishop of London was to try heretics under these articles; accusations of excessive cruelty and bias against the accused were spread broadcast by his enemies, and from the first he seems to have been unpopular in London. He became a staunch conservative. During the years 1542-43 he was again abroad in [[Spain]] and Germany as ambassador to the emperor, at the end of which time he returned to London.\n\nThe death of the king on 28 January 1547, proved the turning point in Bonner's career. Hitherto he had shown himself entirely subservient to the sovereign, supporting him in the matter of the divorce, approving of the suppression of the religious houses, taking the [[oath of Supremacy]] which [[John Fisher|Fisher]] and [[Thomas More|More]] refused at the cost of their lives. But while accepting the schism from Rome, he had always resisted the innovations of the Reformers, and held to the doctrines of the old religion.\n\nTherefore, from the first he put himself in opposition to the religious changes introduced by [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Protector Somerset]] and [[Thomas Cranmer|Archbishop Cranmer]]. Bonner began to doubt that supremacy when he saw to what uses it could be put by a Protestant council, and either he or Gardiner evolved the theory that the royal supremacy was in abeyance during a royal minority. The ground was skillfully chosen, but it was not legally nor constitutionally tenable. Both he and Gardiner had in fact sought fresh licences to exercise their ecclesiastical jurisdiction from the young king [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]; and, if he was supreme enough to confer jurisdiction, he was supreme enough to issue the injunctions and order the visitation to which Bonner objected. It was on this question that he came into conflict with Edward's government.{{sfn|Pollard|1911|p=210}}\n\n==Realignment with Catholicism==\n{{Marshalsea}}\n\n===Under Edward VI===\nBonner resisted the visitation of August 1547, and was committed to the [[Fleet Prison]]; but he withdrew his opposition, and was released in time to take an active part against the government in the parliament of November 1547. In the next session, November 1548-March 1549, he was a leading opponent of the first [[Act of Uniformity 1549|Act of Uniformity]] and [[Book of Common Prayer]]. When these became law, he neglected to enforce them, and on 1 September 1549 he was required by the council to maintain at [[St Paul's Cross]] that the royal authority was as great as if the king were forty years of age.{{sfn|Pollard|1911|p=210}}\n\nHe did so, but with such significant omissions in the matter which had been prescribed touching the king's authority, that after a seven days' trial he was deprived of his bishopric by an ecclesiastical court over which [[Thomas Cranmer|Cranmer]] presided, and sent as a prisoner to the [[Marshalsea]]. The fall of Somerset in the following month raised Bonner's hopes, and he appealed from Cranmer to the council. After a struggle the Protestant faction gained the upper hand, and on 7 February 1550 Bonner's deprivation was confirmed by the council sitting in the Star Chamber, and he was further condemned to perpetual imprisonment, where he remained until the accession of [[Mary I of England|Mary]] in 1553.{{sfn|Pollard|1911|p=210}}\n\n===Under Mary I===\nBonner was at once restored to his see, his deprivation being regarded as invalid and [[Nicholas Ridley (martyr)|Ridley]] as an intruder. He vigorously restored [[Roman Catholicism]] in his diocese, made no difficulty about submitting to the papal jurisdiction which he had foresworn.{{sfn|Pollard|1911|p=210}} During 1554 Bonner carried out a visitation of his diocese, restoring the Mass and the manifold practices and emblems of Catholic life, but the work was carried out slowly and with difficulty. To help in the work, Bonner published a list of thirty-seven \"Articles to be enquired of\", but these led to such disturbances that they were temporarily withdrawn.\n\nMary's administration thought that religious dissidents would best be dealt with by ecclesiastical tribunals rather than by the civil power. As Bonner was Bishop of London, the chief burden of stamping out religious dissent fell to him. Therefore, in 1555, he began the persecution to which he owes his notoriety among his detractors as \"Bloody Bonner.\" He was appointed to degrade Cranmer at [[Oxford]] in February 1556. The part he took in these affairs gave rise to intense hatred on the part of the rebels. [[John Foxe|Foxe]] in his ''Book of Martyrs'' summed up this view in two lines:\n\n:\"This cannibal in three years space three hundred martyrs slew\n:They were his food, he loved so blood, he spar\u00e8d none he knew.\"\n\nHis apologists, including defenders of Catholicism in England, claim his actions were merely \"official\", and that \"he had no control\" over the fate of the accused \"once they were declared to be irreclaimable heretics and handed over to the secular power; but he always strove by gentle suasion first to reconcile them to the Church\";  the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' estimates the number of persons executed as heretics in his jurisdiction as about 120, rather than 300. Many of his victims were forced upon him by the king and queen in Council, which at one point addressed a letter to Bonner on the express ground that he was not proceeding with sufficient severity. So completely had the state dominated the church that religious persecutions had become state persecutions, and Bonner was acting as an ecclesiastical sheriff in the most refractory district of the realm. Even [[John Foxe]] records instances in which Bonner failed to persecute those authorised for persecution.{{sfn|Pollard|1911|pp=210\u2013211}}\n[[File:Edmund Bonner punishing a heretic.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Bishop Bonner punishing a heretic from [[Foxe's Book of Martyrs]]  (1563)]]\nBonner's detractors, beginning with his Protestant contemporaries [[John Foxe]] and [[John Bale]] and continuing through most English historiography of the period, paint a different picture. Bonner, they point out, was one of those who brought it to pass that the condemnation of heretics to the fire should be part of his ordinary official duties, and he was represented as hounding men and women to death with merciless vindictiveness. Bale, formerly a friar and ex-[[Bishop of Ossory]], published from his place of exile at [[Basle]] in 1554 an attack on the bishop, in which he speaks of him as among other things, \"the bloody sheep-bite of London\" and \"bloody Bonner\".\n\nBonner's most important writings date from this time. They include ''Responsum et Exhortatio in laudem Sacerdotii'' (1553); ''Articles to be enquired of in the General Visitation of Edmund Bishop of London'' (1554); and ''{{Proper name|Homelies sette forth by Eddmune Byshop of London, ... to be read within his diocese of London of all Parsons, vycars and curates, unto their parishioners upon Sondayes and holy days}}'' (1555), as well as a [[catechism]], probably written by his chaplains, [[Nicholas Harpsfield]] and [[Henry Pendleton]], entitled \"A profitable and necessary doctrine\" (1554, 2d ed. 1555).\n\n==Under Elizabeth==\nAfter the death of Mary, [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] succeeded to the throne. The Council ordered him to resign the bishopric, which he refused to do, adding that he preferred death. He was sent again to the [[Marshalsea]] prison on 20 April 1560. During the next two years representatives of the Protestant party frequently clamored for the execution of Bonner and the other imprisoned bishops. When the Parliament of 1563 met, a new Act was passed by which the first refusal of the [[oath of royal supremacy]] was ''[[praemunire]]'', the second, [[high treason]]. The bishops had refused the oath once, so that by this Act, which became law on 10 April 1563, their next refusal of the oath might be followed by their death.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} Thanks to the intervention of the Spanish ambassador, action against the bishops was delayed; but a year later, on 29 April 1564, Bonner was indicted on a charge of ''[[praemunire]]'' on refusing the oath when tendered him by his diocesan, [[Robert Horne (bishop)|Bishop Horne of Winchester]]. He challenged the legality of Horne's consecration, and a special act of parliament was passed to meet the point, while the charge against Bonner was withdrawn.{{sfn|Pollard|1911|p=211}} Four times a year for three years he was forced to appear in the courts at Westminster only to be further remanded. The last of these appearances took place in the Michaelmas term of 1568, so the last year of the bishop's life was spent in prison. His demeanor during his long imprisonment was remarkable for his cheerfulness, and even [[John Jewel]], the [[Bishop of Salisbury]], describes him in a letter as \"a most courteous man and gentlemanly both in his manners and appearance\" (''Zurich Letters'', I, 34).\n\nBonner never tired of trying to convert others to Catholicism, and never expressed regret over his actions under Queen Mary. Bishop Jewel, in a letter to [[Peter Martyr Vermigli]], related that \"{{lang|en-emodeng|Being confined to the tower of London upon accession of Queen Elizabeth, the highest punishment inflicted, he went to visit some of the criminals kept in that prison, and wishing to encourage them, called them his friends and neighbors}}.\"\n\nUpon this, one of them is said to have answered, \"Go beast, into hell, and find your friends there, for we are none of them. I killed but one man upon a provocation, and do truly repent of it; but you have killed many persons of all sorts, without any provocation from them, and are hardened in your impenitence.\" Bonner died in the Marshalsea on 5 September 1569, and was buried in St George's, [[Southwark]], secretly at midnight to avoid the risk of a hostile demonstration.\n\n==Bonner in historical memory==\n{{one source|section|date=June 2017}}\nContemporary Catholic writers attributed to Bonner and the other bishops who died in prison the honour of martyrdom: ''in vinculis obierunt martyres''. On the walls of the [[English College, Rome]], an inscription recording the deaths of eleven bishops, but without naming them, found a place among the paintings of the martyrs. Bonner was attacked during life with a rare hatred which has followed him into the grave, so that in English history few names have been so execrated and vilified as his.\n\nA more charitable assessment of Bonner's character was made by an Anglican historian, [[S. R. Maitland]], who considers him,<blockquote>''\"... {{lang|en-emodeng|a man, straightforward and hearty, familiar and humorous, sometimes rough, perhaps coarse, naturally hot tempered, but obviously (by the testimony of his enemies) placable and easily entreated, capable of bearing most patiently much intemperate and insolent language, much reviling and low abuse directed against himself personally, against his order, and against those peculiar doctrines and practices of his church for maintaining which he had himself suffered the loss of all things, and borne long imprisonment. [...] In short, we can scarcely read with attention any one of the cases detailed by those who were no friends of Bonner, without seeing in him a judge who (even if we grant that he was dispensing bad laws badly) was obviously desirous to save the prisoner's life}}.\"''\n</blockquote>\n\nThis verdict was generally followed by later historians. [[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Lord Acton]] in the ''[[Cambridge Modern History]]'' (1904) argued: \"The number of those put to death in his diocese of London was undoubtedly disproportionately large, but this would seem to have been more the result of the strength of the reforming element in the capital and in Essex than of the employment of exceptional rigour;

He became notorious as \"Bloody Bonner\" for his role in the persecution of [[heresy|heretics]] under the Catholic government of [[Mary I of England]], and ended his life as a prisoner under [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]].\n\n==Early life==\nBonner was the son of Elizabeth Frodsham, who was married to Edmund Bonner, a [[Sawyer (occupation)|sawyer]] of [[Hanley, Worcestershire]]. [[John Strype]] printed an account, with many circumstantial details, stating that Bonner was the natural son of George Savage, [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of [[Davenham]], Cheshire, and that his mother married Bonner only after the future bishop's birth.<ref>J. Strype, ''Ecclesiastical Memorials Relating Chiefly to Religion, and the Reformation of it'' (Clarendon Press, Oxford 1822), Vol. III part 1, [https://archive.org/details/ecclesiasticalm06strygoog/page/n194 pp. 172-73] (Internet Archive).</ref> This account was disputed by Strype's contemporary, Sir Edmund Lechmere, who asserted that Bonner was of legitimate birth.<ref>J.

He was ordained about the same time and admitted doctor of civil law (DCL) in 1525.<ref>'Bonner (Bonar), Edmund', in J.

After the fall of Wolsey he remained faithful to him and was with him at the time of his arrest at [[Cawood]] and death at [[Leicester]] in 1530. Subsequently, he was transferred, perhaps through Cromwell's influence, to the service of the king, and in January 1532 he was sent to [[Rome]] as the king's agent when the question of the king's divorce was raised. There he sought to obstruct the judicial proceedings against Henry in the [[Roman Curia|papal curia]].{{sfn|Pollard|1911|p=210}}\n\nIn October 1533 he was entrusted with the task of suggesting to [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]] (while he was the guest of [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] at [[Marseille]]) Henry's appeal from the pope to a general council; but there seems to be no good authority for [[Gilbert Burnet]]'s story that Clement threatened to have him burnt alive. For these and other services Bonner had been rewarded by successive grants of the livings of Cherry Burton ([[Yorkshire|Yorks]]), Ripple ([[Worcestershire|Worcester]]), [[Blaydon]] ([[County Durham|Durham]]), and [[East Dereham]] ([[Norfolk]]). In 1535, he was made [[List of Archdeacons of Leicester|Archdeacon of Leicester]].{{sfn|Pollard|1911|p=210}}\n\nDuring the following years he was much employed on important embassies in the king's interests, first to the pope to appeal against the excommunication pronounced in July 1533, afterwards to the [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] to dissuade him from attending the general council which the pope wished to summon at [[Vicenza]]. Towards the end of 1535 he was sent to further what he called \"the cause of the Gospel\" (''Letters and Papers'', 1536, No. 469) in North [[Germany]]; and in 1536 he wrote a preface to [[Stephen Gardiner]]'s ''De vera Obedientia'', which asserted the royal and denied the papal  supremacy, and was received with delight by the [[Martin Luther|Lutherans]]. After a brief embassy to the Emperor in the spring of 1538, Bonner succeeded [[Stephen Gardiner|Gardiner]] as ambassador to the French Court in [[Paris]]. In this capacity he proved capable and successful, though irritation was frequently caused by his overbearing and dictatorial manner. He began his mission by sending Cromwell a long list of accusations against his predecessor. He was almost as bitter against [[Thomas Wyatt (poet)|Wyatt]] and Mason, whom he denounced as a \"papist\", and the violence of his conduct led [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] to threaten him with a hundred strokes of the halberd. He seems, however, to have pleased his patron, Cromwell, and perhaps Henry, by his energy in seeing the king's \"Great\" Bible in English through the press in Paris. He was already king's chaplain; his appointment at Paris had been accompanied by promotion to the [[See of Hereford]] (27 November 1538) but owing to his absence he could neither be consecrated nor take possession of his see, and he was still abroad when he was translated to the Bishopric of London (October 1539).{{sfn|Pollard|1911|p=210}} Bonner returned to England and was consecrated 4 April 1540.\n\nHitherto Bonner had had a reputation as a somewhat coarse and unscrupulous tool of Cromwell &ndash; a sort of ecclesiastical [[Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton|Wriothesley]], he is not known to have protested against any of the changes effected by his masters; he professed to be no theologian, and was in the habit, when asked technical questions, to refer his interrogators to the theologians. He had graduated in law, and not in theology. There was nothing in the Reformation to appeal to him, except the repudiation of papal control; and he was one of those numerous Englishmen whose views were faithfully reflected in Henry's Act of the [[Six Articles (1539)|Six Articles]].{{sfn|Pollard|1911|p=210}} Indeed, almost his first duty as Bishop of London was to try heretics under these articles; accusations of excessive cruelty and bias against the accused were spread broadcast by his enemies, and from the first he seems to have been unpopular in London. He became a staunch conservative. During the years 1542-43 he was again abroad in [[Spain]] and Germany as ambassador to the emperor, at the end of which time he returned to London.\n\nThe death of the king on 28 January 1547, proved the turning point in Bonner's career. Hitherto he had shown himself entirely subservient to the sovereign, supporting him in the matter of the divorce, approving of the suppression of the religious houses, taking the [[oath of Supremacy]] which [[John Fisher|Fisher]] and [[Thomas More|More]] refused at the cost of their lives. But while accepting the schism from Rome, he had always resisted the innovations of the Reformers, and held to the doctrines of the old religion.\n\nTherefore, from the first he put himself in opposition to the religious changes introduced by [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Protector Somerset]] and [[Thomas Cranmer|Archbishop Cranmer]]. Bonner began to doubt that supremacy when he saw to what uses it could be put by a Protestant council, and either he or Gardiner evolved the theory that the royal supremacy was in abeyance during a royal minority. The ground was skillfully chosen, but it was not legally nor constitutionally tenable. Both he and Gardiner had in fact sought fresh licences to exercise their ecclesiastical jurisdiction from the young king [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]; and, if he was supreme enough to confer jurisdiction, he was supreme enough to issue the injunctions and order the visitation to which Bonner objected. It was on this question that he came into conflict with Edward's government.{{sfn|Pollard|1911|p=210}}\n\n==Realignment with Catholicism==\n{{Marshalsea}}\n\n===Under Edward VI===\nBonner resisted the visitation of August 1547, and was committed to the [[Fleet Prison]]; but he withdrew his opposition, and was released in time to take an active part against the government in the parliament of November 1547. In the next session, November 1548-March 1549, he was a leading opponent of the first [[Act of Uniformity 1549|Act of Uniformity]] and [[Book of Common Prayer]]. When these became law, he neglected to enforce them, and on 1 September 1549 he was required by the council to maintain at [[St Paul's Cross]] that the royal authority was as great as if the king were forty years of age.{{sfn|Pollard|1911|p=210}}\n\nHe did so, but with such significant omissions in the matter which had been prescribed touching the king's authority, that after a seven days' trial he was deprived of his bishopric by an ecclesiastical court over which [[Thomas Cranmer|Cranmer]] presided, and sent as a prisoner to the [[Marshalsea]]. The fall of Somerset in the following month raised Bonner's hopes, and he appealed from Cranmer to the council. After a struggle the Protestant faction gained the upper hand, and on 7 February 1550 Bonner's deprivation was confirmed by the council sitting in the Star Chamber, and he was further condemned to perpetual imprisonment, where he remained until the accession of [[Mary I of England|Mary]] in 1553.{{sfn|Pollard|1911|p=210}}\n\n===Under Mary I===\nBonner was at once restored to his see, his deprivation being regarded as invalid and [[Nicholas Ridley (martyr)|Ridley]] as an intruder. He vigorously restored [[Roman Catholicism]] in his diocese, made no difficulty about submitting to the papal jurisdiction which he had foresworn.{{sfn|Pollard|1911|p=210}} During 1554 Bonner carried out a visitation of his diocese, restoring the Mass and the manifold practices and emblems of Catholic life, but the work was carried out slowly and with difficulty. To help in the work, Bonner published a list of thirty-seven \"Articles to be enquired of\", but these led to such disturbances that they were temporarily withdrawn.\n\nMary's administration thought that religious dissidents would best be dealt with by ecclesiastical tribunals rather than by the civil power. As Bonner was Bishop of London, the chief burden of stamping out religious dissent fell to him. Therefore, in 1555, he began the persecution to which he owes his notoriety among his detractors as \"Bloody Bonner.\" He was appointed to degrade Cranmer at [[Oxford]] in February 1556. The part he took in these affairs gave rise to intense hatred on the part of the rebels. [[John Foxe|Foxe]] in his ''Book of Martyrs'' summed up this view in two lines:\n\n:\"This cannibal in three years space three hundred martyrs slew\n:They were his food, he loved so blood, he spar\u00e8d none he knew.\"\n\nHis apologists, including defenders of Catholicism in England, claim his actions were merely \"official\", and that \"he had no control\" over the fate of the accused \"once they were declared to be irreclaimable heretics and handed over to the secular power; but he always strove by gentle suasion first to reconcile them to the Church\";  the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' estimates the number of persons executed as heretics in his jurisdiction as about 120, rather than 300. Many of his victims were forced upon him by the king and queen in Council, which at one point addressed a letter to Bonner on the express ground that he was not proceeding with sufficient severity. So completely had the state dominated the church that religious persecutions had become state persecutions, and Bonner was acting as an ecclesiastical sheriff in the most refractory district of the realm. Even [[John Foxe]] records instances in which Bonner failed to persecute those authorised for persecution.{{sfn|Pollard|1911|pp=210\u2013211}}\n[[File:Edmund Bonner punishing a heretic.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Bishop Bonner punishing a heretic from [[Foxe's Book of Martyrs]]  (1563)]]\nBonner's detractors, beginning with his Protestant contemporaries [[John Foxe]] and [[John Bale]] and continuing through most English historiography of the period, paint a different picture. Bonner, they point out, was one of those who brought it to pass that the condemnation of heretics to the fire should be part of his ordinary official duties, and he was represented as hounding men and women to death with merciless vindictiveness. Bale, formerly a friar and ex-[[Bishop of Ossory]], published from his place of exile at [[Basle]] in 1554 an attack on the bishop, in which he speaks of him as among other things, \"the bloody sheep-bite of London\" and \"bloody Bonner\".\n\nBonner's most important writings date from this time. They include ''Responsum et Exhortatio in laudem Sacerdotii'' (1553); ''Articles to be enquired of in the General Visitation of Edmund Bishop of London'' (1554); and ''{{Proper name|Homelies sette forth by Eddmune Byshop of London, ... to be read within his diocese of London of all Parsons, vycars and curates, unto their parishioners upon Sondayes and holy days}}'' (1555), as well as a [[catechism]], probably written by his chaplains, [[Nicholas Harpsfield]] and [[Henry Pendleton]], entitled \"A profitable and necessary doctrine\" (1554, 2d ed. 1555).\n\n==Under Elizabeth==\nAfter the death of Mary, [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] succeeded to the throne. The Council ordered him to resign the bishopric, which he refused to do, adding that he preferred death. He was sent again to the [[Marshalsea]] prison on 20 April 1560. During the next two years representatives of the Protestant party frequently clamored for the execution of Bonner and the other imprisoned bishops. When the Parliament of 1563 met, a new Act was passed by which the first refusal of the [[oath of royal supremacy]] was ''[[praemunire]]'', the second, [[high treason]]. The bishops had refused the oath once, so that by this Act, which became law on 10 April 1563, their next refusal of the oath might be followed by their death.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} Thanks to the intervention of the Spanish ambassador, action against the bishops was delayed; but a year later, on 29 April 1564, Bonner was indicted on a charge of ''[[praemunire]]'' on refusing the oath when tendered him by his diocesan, Bishop Horne of [[Winchester]]. He challenged the legality of Horne's consecration, and a special act of parliament was passed to meet the point, while the charge against Bonner was withdrawn.{{sfn|Pollard|1911|p=211}} Four times a year for three years he was forced to appear in the courts at Westminster only to be further remanded. The last of these appearances took place in the Michaelmas term of 1568, so the last year of the bishop's life was spent in prison. His demeanor during his long imprisonment was remarkable for his cheerfulness, and even [[John Jewel]], the [[Bishop of Salisbury]], describes him in a letter as \"a most courteous man and gentlemanly both in his manners and appearance\" (''Zurich Letters'', I, 34).\n\nBonner never tired of trying to convert others to Catholicism, and never expressed regret over his actions under Queen Mary. Bishop Jewel, in a letter to [[Peter Martyr Vermigli]], related that \"{{lang|en-emodeng|Being confined to the tower of London upon accession of Queen Elizabeth, the highest punishement inflicted, he went to visit some of the criminals kept in that prison, and wishing to encourage them, called them his friends and neighbors}}.\"\n\nUpon this, one of them is said to have answered, \"Go beast, into hell, and find your friends there, for we are none of them. I killed but one man upon a provocation, and do truly repent of it; but you have killed many persons of all sorts, without any provocation from them, and are hardened in your impenitence.\" Bonner died in the Marshalsea on 5 September 1569, and was buried in St George's, [[Southwark]], secretly at midnight to avoid the risk of a hostile demonstration.\n\n==Bonner in historical memory==\n{{one source|section|date=June 2017}}\nContemporary Catholic writers attributed to Bonner and the other bishops who died in prison the honour of martyrdom: ''in vinculis obierunt martyres''. On the walls of the [[English College, Rome]], an inscription recording the deaths of eleven bishops, but without naming them, found a place among the paintings of the martyrs. Bonner was attacked during life with a rare hatred which has followed him into the grave, so that in English history few names have been so execrated and vilified as his.\n\nA more charitable assessment of Bonner's character was made by an Anglican historian, [[S.

The 1652 Commonwealth Survey spells it as ''Nedd''. A 1661 Inquisition spells it as ''The Nedd''.\n\nFrom medieval times up to the early 1600s, the land belonged to the [[McKiernan Clan]]. About the year 1600 it was owned by Thomas McKiernan, along with the townlands of [[Bellaheady]], [[Greaghacholea]] or Coraghmuck and [[Doogary]], all in Tullyhunco Barony.

Webb]] of [[New York City|New York]] for the Merchants Steamship Company. One of [[Narragansett Bay]]'s so-called \"floating palaces\",<ref name=floatingpalaces/> the luxuriously outfitted ''Bristol'' and her sister ship [[Providence (1866)|''Providence'']], each of which could carry up to 1,200  passengers, were installed with the largest engines then built in the [[United States]], and were considered to be amongst the finest American-built vessels of their era.\n\nBoth ships would spend their entire careers steaming between New York and various destinations in and around Narragansett Bay, [[Rhode Island]]. ''Bristol'' was eventually destroyed by a fire while in port in 1888.\n\n==Development==\n\n''Bristol'' and ''Providence'' owed their existence to a short-lived company known as the Merchants Steamship Company, which placed the initial order for the vessels with the Webb shipyard in about 1865. Merchants Steamship was an amalgamation of three existing Narragansett Bay shipping lines, the Commercial Line, Neptune Line and Stonington Line. The Company intended to run the two steamers between New York and [[Bristol, Rhode Island]] in competition with the [[Fall River Line]], which ran a similar service from New York to [[Fall River, Massachusetts]] (both Lines then linking up to railway lines that continued on to [[Boston]]).<ref name=covell4>Covell, pp. 4-5.</ref>\n\n==Construction==\n[[ File:Casting a marine engine cylinder at the Etna Iron Works, 1866.jpg | thumb | left | Casting the mammoth cylinder of either ''Bristol'' or ''Providence''&mdash;probably ''Bristol''&mdash;at the [[Etna Iron Works]], February 3, 1866 ]] \nWork on both ''Bristol'' and ''Providence'' was delayed by a long strike, but ''Bristol'' was eventually launched on 4 April 1866,<ref name=nyt_5apr1866>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1866/04/05/90433484.pdf \"Launch of the Sound Steamer Bristol\"], ''The New York Times'', 1866-04-05.</ref> and ''Providence'' on July 28 of the same year.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1866/07/28/archives/local-intelligence-cholera-the-official-reportsthe-poison-in.html \"General City News\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 28, 1866.</ref> Between December 1865 and December 1866 however, the Merchants Steamship Company lost three of its existing ships, all of which were uninsured, thereby bankrupting the Company. ''Bristol'' and ''Providence'' remained in an uncompleted state at the shipyard until a new company, the Narragansett Steamship Company, which was partly owned by financier [[James Fisk (financier)|Jim Fisk]], bought the new vessels in early 1867 and paid for their completion.<ref name=covell11>Covell, p. 11.</ref>\n\n===Engines===\n\n''Bristol'' and ''Providence'' were both fitted with massive 110-inch-[[engine cylinder|cylinder]] (9 foot 2&nbsp;inch), 12-foot [[stroke (engine)|stroke]] walking beam engines, the largest engines ever fitted to American vessels up to that time - larger even than the 100-inch-cylinder engines for the mammoth ironclad {{USS|Dunderberg}} built at the Webb shipyard around the same time.<ref name=covell21/> The steamboats' engines, which operated at the stately pace of 19 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]], were designed by Erasmus W. Smith and built by the [[Etna Iron Works]], which had only recently installed a [[lathe]] capable of boring such huge cylinders. The lathe itself was one of the two largest machine tools in the United States, the other being a planer installed by the same company.<ref name=swann20>Swann, p. 20.</ref>\n\n==Description==\n\nWhen completed, ''Bristol'' and ''Providence'' were amongst the largest and most lavishly outfitted American vessels of their time. They were the largest wooden-hulled steamers ever built for service on [[Long Island Sound]] and the first to have two full passenger decks above the main deck.<ref>Dunbaugh: \"Long Island Sound nightboats in 1900.\"</ref>\n\nEach ship had 240 staterooms and over 300 berths, capable of accommodating 1,200 passengers, 840 of them in sleeping quarters. Their freight capacity was estimated at 40 railroad freight cars each. Their wooden hulls and paddle-boxes were strengthened with iron cross-bracings, while for safety they were installed with watertight compartments. The ships had gas lighting, and later on, steam heating and steam-powered steering. The decks, which were built of white oak, included an extra \"gallery tier\" deck from which passengers could view their surroundings.<ref name=covell2123>Covell, pp. 21-22.</ref>\n[[ File:PS Bristol saloon.jpg | thumb|Interior of ''Bristol''{{'}}s saloon, showing the lavish appointments]]  \nContemporary American observers gushed over the size and sophistication of the ships, lauding them as \"world renowned mammoth palace steamers\", \"so far in advance of the type of steamboats heretofore built that they were looked upon as marvels\" and \"the finest specimens of marine\narchitecture of their day.\"<ref name=covell2123/> One observer described the interiors thus:\n\n<blockquote> ... The painting, by George C. Barker & Son, and the decorating by Hayman, of this city, have been a source of enormous outlay, but the result is an equivalent to the cost, for the passenger, on arriving at the Quarter Deck and proceeding to the Grand Saloon, must certainly imagine that he is in the halls of enchantment, only read of in the Arabian Nights' Entertainments. In each panel of the quarter-deck is painted a piece of statuary, while every nook and corner is covered with paint of the most delicate hue and finished off with an abundance of gilt. The appearance of the main saloon is really charming. Here, there, and everywhere, are flowers and birds, the one, in some cases, just appearing to blossom and the other, apparently, just waiting to spring from a branch, whereon it is perched, so naturally is everything done. In the main saloon, ladies' saloon, and social hall, may be seen very delightful specimens of good taste in the selection of the new velvet carpets, rugs, mats, silk curtains, lace curtains, etc., all of which are of the very costliest kind. The whole of the furniture in the grand saloon and ladies' saloon is covered in plum colored velvet, while that of the social hall is done in velvet and rep, each having a very beautiful effect on the surroundings ...<ref name=floatingpalaces>\"The Floating Palaces, 'Providence' and 'Bristol'\", ''Newport Mercury'', April 28, 1877, quoted in Covell, pp. 23-24.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs a finishing touch, flamboyant owner Jim Fisk had 250 canaries in cages installed in each ship, each bird personally named by Fisk himself.<ref name=heritage/>\n\n''Bristol'' and ''Providence'' began a tradition of luxury travel on Narragansett Bay that would remain a popular attraction to travellers for the next fifty years. For a modest price, an ordinary working person could gain a glimpse of the opulent lifestyles of the wealthy just by taking a cruise on such a vessel.<ref>[http://xroads.virginia.edu/~MA01/davis/newport/leisure/fallriverline.html \"The Fall River Line and Other Steamers\"], by Kay Davis, University of Virginia.</ref>\n\n==Service history==\n[[File:Bristol (1865 steamboat).jpg | thumb|left | ''Bristol'' underway, illustration by Stanton]] \n[[File:1883_Frank_Leslie%27s_Illustrated_Newspaper_Brooklyn_Bridge_New_York_City.jpg| thumb | left |On the cover of [[Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper]], the ''Bristol'' is one of the ships shown passing under the newly-completed [[Brooklyn Bridge]] .]]\n''Bristol'' made her maiden voyage in June 1867, and for the next two years was to maintain the run from New York to Bristol, Rhode Island, as part of the Narragansett Steamship Company's Bristol Line. In 1869, the Narragansett Steamship Company merged with the Boston, Newport and New York Steamboat Company, and ''Bristol'' and her sister ship ''Providence'' thus joined the latter Company's Fall River Line. The two vessels began running from New York to Fall River, Massachusetts, with a stop at [[Newport, Rhode Island]], while the service to Bristol was discontinued. ''Bristol'' would subsequently maintain the New York-Fall River route to the end of her career.<ref name=covell21>Covell, p. 21.</ref>\n\n===Innovations in customer service===\n[[File:Bristol Providence ad.jpg|thumb|200px|An advertisement for ''Bristol'' and ''Providence'', emphasizing the onboard musical entertainment]]\nWhen first put into service, the owner of the Narragansett Steamship Company, Jim Fisk, would don an elaborate Admiral's uniform and greet every passenger boarding ''Bristol'' (or her sister ship ''Providence'') at the gangway. Right on schedule, Fisk would give the order to sail, and the ship would put to sea \"with the heavy load of passengers crowding her decks, music playing, flags flying, all her crew in uniform, each man having a badge on his cap showing his office and duty...\". Fisk would remain on board until the ship pulled well out into the bay, at which time the vessel would stop and he would transfer to a [[pilot boat]] which would take him back to the city, after which ''Bristol'' would continue on her way.<ref name=heritage>[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1954/1/1954_1_6.shtml \"The Old Fall River Line\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201202933/http://americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1954/1/1954_1_6.shtml |date=2008-12-01 }} by Oliver Jensen, ''American Heritage'' magazine, December 1954, Volume 6, Issue 1, as reproduced at americanheritage.com.</ref><ref name=covell2427/>\n\nThis elaborate sailing ceremony was soon discontinued, and Fisk contented himself with remaining on shore to salute the ship in his Admiral's uniform as she put out to sea. Two of Fisk's other innovations however, were to have a more lasting impact. These were, firstly, the supply of uniforms to the crews of his ships, an unusual practice at the time, but one which had an agreeable impact on customers, and secondly, the employment of a band of musicians on each vessel to entertain passengers on their journey. Both of these innovations would thenceforth become traditions on Fall River Line  steamers.<ref name=covell2427>Covell, pp. 24-27.</ref>\n\n===Collisions and other accidents===\n\nOver the course of her 21-year career, ''Bristol'' was involved in several collisions and other accidents, many of them occurring in conditions of heavy fog.<ref name=covell2728/> The more significant of these are listed below.\n\nIn July 1869, ''Bristol'' collided with and sank a bark near [[Sands Point, New York]]. Fortunately the crew of the latter was rescued. In October of the same year, ''Bristol'' ran ashore on Bishop's Rock, off Coddington Point, Newport, remaining there for a day before being removed safely and without damage.<ref name=covell2728/>\n\nOn 10 August 1872, ''Bristol'' ran into and sank the bark ''Bessie Rogers'', which was at anchor outside the Torpedo Station on [[Goat Island, Rhode Island]], in conditions of thick fog. ''Bessie Rogers'' was later salvaged and resumed service. ''Bristol'' was to run ashore in much the same area about eighteen months later, on April 12, 1874, but no damage was done and the ship was refloated three hours later with the assistance of the [[revenue cutter]] ''Samuel Dexter''. ''Bristol'' ran ashore again in thick fog on the mud flats near Newport Harbor on June 14, 1877, remaining there until floated off by the rising tide about four hours later.<ref name=covell2728>Covell, pp. 27-28.</ref>\n\n==Destruction==\n\n''Bristol'' departed New York on what was to become her final voyage on December 29, 1888, arriving at Newport Harbor around 3am on December 30.<ref name=covell28/>\n\nAround 6am, people on the wharf noticed flames breaking through the ship's upper deck near the engine. The flames spread so quickly that the last passengers had difficulty leaving the ship. Firemen arrived but were unable to contain the flames. After several hours, most of the ship except the hull and paddle-boxes, which were too saturated with salt water to burn, had been destroyed, and the ship subsequently sank.<ref name=covell28/>\n\nThe remains of the vessel were raised on January 25, 1889, towed to the south dock and sold. In March a wrecking schooner removed the ship's machinery, after which the hull was presumably scrapped.<ref name=covell28>Covell, p. 28.</ref>\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*Covell, William King: \"Steamboats on Narragansett Bay\", ''Bulletin of the Newport Historical Society, No. 90'', January 1934.\n*Swann, Leonard Alexander Jr. (1965): ''John Roach, Maritime Entrepreneur: the Years as Naval Contractor 1862&ndash;1886'' &mdash; United States Naval Institute, p.&nbsp;20 (reprinted 1980 by Ayer Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0-405-13078-6}}).\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bristol (1866)}}\n[[Category:1866 ships]]\n[[Category:Ships built by William H.

Webb]] of [[New York City|New York]] for the Merchants Steamship Company. One of [[Narragansett Bay]]'s so-called \"floating palaces\",<ref name=floatingpalaces/> the luxuriously outfitted ''Bristol'' and her sister ship [[Providence (1866)|''Providence'']], each of which could carry up to 1,200  passengers, were installed with the largest engines then built in the [[United States]], and were considered to be amongst the finest American-built vessels of their era.\n\nBoth ships would spend their entire careers steaming between New York and various destinations in and around Narragansett Bay, [[Rhode Island]]. ''Bristol'' was eventually destroyed by a fire while in port in 1888.\n\n==Development==\n\n''Bristol'' and ''Providence'' owed their existence to a short-lived company known as the Merchants Steamship Company, which placed the initial order for the vessels with the Webb shipyard in about 1865. Merchants Steamship was an amalgamation of three existing Narragansett Bay shipping lines, the Commercial Line, Neptune Line and Stonington Line. The Company intended to run the two steamers between New York and [[Bristol, Rhode Island]] in competition with the [[Fall River Line]], which ran a similar service from New York to [[Fall River, Massachusetts]] (both Lines then linking up to railway lines that continued on to [[Boston]]).<ref name=covell4>Covell, pp. 4-5.</ref>\n\n==Construction==\n[[ File:Casting a marine engine cylinder at the Etna Iron Works, 1866.jpg | thumb | left | Casting the mammoth cylinder of either ''Bristol'' or ''Providence''&mdash;probably ''Bristol''&mdash;at the [[Etna Iron Works]], February 3, 1866 ]] \nWork on both ''Bristol'' and ''Providence'' was delayed by a long strike, but ''Bristol'' was eventually launched on 4 April 1866,<ref name=nyt_5apr1866>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1866/04/05/90433484.pdf \"Launch of the Sound Steamer Bristol\"], ''The New York Times'', 1866-04-05.</ref> and ''Providence'' on July 28 of the same year.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1866/07/28/archives/local-intelligence-cholera-the-official-reportsthe-poison-in.html \"General City News\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 28, 1866.</ref> Between December 1865 and December 1866 however, the Merchants Steamship Company lost three of its existing ships, all of which were uninsured, thereby bankrupting the Company. ''Bristol'' and ''Providence'' remained in an uncompleted state at the shipyard until a new company, the Narragansett Steamship Company, which was partly owned by financier [[James Fisk (financier)|Jim Fisk]], bought the new vessels in early 1867 and paid for their completion.<ref name=covell11>Covell, p. 11.</ref>\n\n===Engines===\n\n''Bristol'' and ''Providence'' were both fitted with massive 110-inch-[[engine cylinder|cylinder]] (9 foot 2&nbsp;inch), 12-foot [[stroke (engine)|stroke]] walking beam engines, the largest engines ever fitted to American vessels up to that time - larger even than the 100-inch-cylinder engines for the mammoth ironclad {{USS|Dunderberg}} built at the Webb shipyard around the same time.<ref name=covell21/> The steamboats' engines, which operated at the stately pace of 19 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]], were designed by Erasmus W. Smith and built by the [[Etna Iron Works]], which had only recently installed a lathe capable of boring such huge cylinders. The lathe itself was one of the two largest machine tools in the United States, the other being a planer installed by the same company.<ref name=swann20>Swann, p. 20.</ref>\n\n==Description==\n\nWhen completed, ''Bristol'' and ''Providence'' were amongst the largest and most lavishly outfitted American vessels of their time. They were the largest wooden-hulled steamers ever built for service on [[Long Island Sound]] and the first to have two full passenger decks above the main deck.<ref>Dunbaugh: \"Long Island Sound nightboats in 1900.\"</ref>\n\nEach ship had 240 staterooms and over 300 berths, capable of accommodating 1,200 passengers, 840 of them in sleeping quarters. Their freight capacity was estimated at 40 railroad freight cars each. Their wooden hulls and paddle-boxes were strengthened with iron cross-bracings, while for safety they were installed with watertight compartments. The ships had gas lighting, and later on, steam heating and steam-powered steering. The decks, which were built of white oak, included an extra \"gallery tier\" deck from which passengers could view their surroundings.<ref name=covell2123>Covell, pp. 21-22.</ref>\n[[ File:PS Bristol saloon.jpg | thumb|Interior of ''Bristol''{{'}}s saloon, showing the lavish appointments]]  \nContemporary American observers gushed over the size and sophistication of the ships, lauding them as \"world renowned mammoth palace steamers\", \"so far in advance of the type of steamboats heretofore built that they were looked upon as marvels\" and \"the finest specimens of marine\narchitecture of their day.\"<ref name=covell2123/> One observer described the interiors thus:\n\n<blockquote> ... The painting, by George C. Barker & Son, and the decorating by Hayman, of this city, have been a source of enormous outlay, but the result is an equivalent to the cost, for the passenger, on arriving at the Quarter Deck and proceeding to the Grand Saloon, must certainly imagine that he is in the halls of enchantment, only read of in the Arabian Nights' Entertainments. In each panel of the quarter-deck is painted a piece of statuary, while every nook and corner is covered with paint of the most delicate hue and finished off with an abundance of gilt. The appearance of the main saloon is really charming. Here, there, and everywhere, are flowers and birds, the one, in some cases, just appearing to blossom and the other, apparently, just waiting to spring from a branch, whereon it is perched, so naturally is everything done. In the main saloon, ladies' saloon, and social hall, may be seen very delightful specimens of good taste in the selection of the new velvet carpets, rugs, mats, silk curtains, lace curtains, etc., all of which are of the very costliest kind. The whole of the furniture in the grand saloon and ladies' saloon is covered in plum colored velvet, while that of the social hall is done in velvet and rep, each having a very beautiful effect on the surroundings ...<ref name=floatingpalaces>\"The Floating Palaces, 'Providence' and 'Bristol'\", ''Newport Mercury'', April 28, 1877, quoted in Covell, pp. 23-24.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs a finishing touch, flamboyant owner Jim Fisk had 250 canaries in cages installed in each ship, each bird personally named by Fisk himself.<ref name=heritage/>\n\n''Bristol'' and ''Providence'' began a tradition of luxury travel on Narragansett Bay that would remain a popular attraction to travellers for the next fifty years. For a modest price, an ordinary working person could gain a glimpse of the opulent lifestyles of the wealthy just by taking a cruise on such a vessel.<ref>[http://xroads.virginia.edu/~MA01/davis/newport/leisure/fallriverline.html \"The Fall River Line and Other Steamers\"], by Kay Davis, University of Virginia.</ref>\n\n==Service history==\n[[File:Bristol (1865 steamboat).jpg | thumb|left | ''Bristol'' underway, illustration by Stanton]] \n[[File:1883_Frank_Leslie%27s_Illustrated_Newspaper_Brooklyn_Bridge_New_York_City.jpg| thumb | left |On the cover of [[Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper]], the ''Bristol'' is one of the ships shown passing under the newly-completed [[Brooklyn Bridge]] .]]\n''Bristol'' made her maiden voyage in June 1867, and for the next two years was to maintain the run from New York to Bristol, Rhode Island, as part of the Narragansett Steamship Company's Bristol Line. In 1869, the Narragansett Steamship Company merged with the Boston, Newport and New York Steamboat Company, and ''Bristol'' and her sister ship ''Providence'' thus joined the latter Company's Fall River Line. The two vessels began running from New York to Fall River, Massachusetts, with a stop at [[Newport, Rhode Island]], while the service to Bristol was discontinued. ''Bristol'' would subsequently maintain the New York-Fall River route to the end of her career.<ref name=covell21>Covell, p. 21.</ref>\n\n===Innovations in customer service===\n[[File:Bristol Providence ad.jpg|thumb|200px|An advertisement for ''Bristol'' and ''Providence'', emphasizing the onboard musical entertainment]]\nWhen first put into service, the owner of the Narragansett Steamship Company, Jim Fisk, would don an elaborate Admiral's uniform and greet every passenger boarding ''Bristol'' (or her sister ship ''Providence'') at the gangway. Right on schedule, Fisk would give the order to sail, and the ship would put to sea \"with the heavy load of passengers crowding her decks, music playing, flags flying, all her crew in uniform, each man having a badge on his cap showing his office and duty...\". Fisk would remain on board until the ship pulled well out into the bay, at which time the vessel would stop and he would transfer to a [[pilot boat]] which would take him back to the city, after which ''Bristol'' would continue on her way.<ref name=heritage>[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1954/1/1954_1_6.shtml \"The Old Fall River Line\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201202933/http://americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1954/1/1954_1_6.shtml |date=2008-12-01 }} by Oliver Jensen, ''American Heritage'' magazine, December 1954, Volume 6, Issue 1, as reproduced at americanheritage.com.</ref><ref name=covell2427/>\n\nThis elaborate sailing ceremony was soon discontinued, and Fisk contented himself with remaining on shore to salute the ship in his Admiral's uniform as she put out to sea. Two of Fisk's other innovations however, were to have a more lasting impact. These were, firstly, the supply of uniforms to the crews of his ships, an unusual practice at the time, but one which had an agreeable impact on customers, and secondly, the employment of a band of musicians on each vessel to entertain passengers on their journey. Both of these innovations would thenceforth become traditions on Fall River Line  steamers.<ref name=covell2427>Covell, pp. 24-27.</ref>\n\n===Collisions and other accidents===\n\nOver the course of her 21-year career, ''Bristol'' was involved in several collisions and other accidents, many of them occurring in conditions of heavy fog.<ref name=covell2728/> The more significant of these are listed below.\n\nIn July 1869, ''Bristol'' collided with and sank a bark near [[Sands Point, New York]]. Fortunately the crew of the latter was rescued. In October of the same year, ''Bristol'' ran ashore on Bishop's Rock, off Coddington Point, Newport, remaining there for a day before being removed safely and without damage.<ref name=covell2728/>\n\nOn 10 August 1872, ''Bristol'' ran into and sank the bark ''Bessie Rogers'', which was at anchor outside the Torpedo Station on [[Goat Island, Rhode Island]], in conditions of thick fog. ''Bessie Rogers'' was later salvaged and resumed service. ''Bristol'' was to run ashore in much the same area about eighteen months later, on April 12, 1874, but no damage was done and the ship was refloated three hours later with the assistance of the [[revenue cutter]] ''Samuel Dexter''. ''Bristol'' ran ashore again in thick fog on the mud flats near Newport Harbor on June 14, 1877, remaining there until floated off by the rising tide about four hours later.<ref name=covell2728>Covell, pp. 27-28.</ref>\n\n==Destruction==\n\n''Bristol'' departed New York on what was to become her final voyage on December 29, 1888, arriving at Newport Harbor around 3am on December 30.<ref name=covell28/>\n\nAround 6am, people on the wharf noticed flames breaking through the ship's upper deck near the engine. The flames spread so quickly that the last passengers had difficulty leaving the ship. Firemen arrived but were unable to contain the flames. After several hours, most of the ship except the hull and paddle-boxes, which were too saturated with salt water to burn, had been destroyed, and the ship subsequently sank.<ref name=covell28/>\n\nThe remains of the vessel were raised on January 25, 1889, towed to the south dock and sold. In March a wrecking schooner removed the ship's machinery, after which the hull was presumably scrapped.<ref name=covell28>Covell, p. 28.</ref>\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*Covell, William King: \"Steamboats on Narragansett Bay\", ''Bulletin of the Newport Historical Society, No. 90'', January 1934.\n*Swann, Leonard Alexander Jr. (1965): ''John Roach, Maritime Entrepreneur: the Years as Naval Contractor 1862&ndash;1886'' &mdash; United States Naval Institute, p.&nbsp;20 (reprinted 1980 by Ayer Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0-405-13078-6}}).\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bristol (1866)}}\n[[Category:1866 ships]]\n[[Category:Ships built by William H.
