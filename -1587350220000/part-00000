A government can declare such a state during a [[natural disaster]], [[civil unrest]], [[armed conflict]], medical [[pandemic]] or [[epidemic]] or other [[biosecurity]] risk. Such declarations alert citizens to change their normal behavior and orders government agencies to implement emergency plans. ''[[Justitium]]'' is its equivalent in Roman law&mdash;a concept in which the senate could put forward a final decree ([[senatus consultum ultimum]]) that was not subject to dispute.\n\nStates of emergency can also be used as a rationale or pretext for suspending rights and freedoms guaranteed under a country's [[constitution]] or [[basic law]], sometimes through [[martial law]] or revoking [[habeas corpus]]. The procedure for and legality of doing so vary by country.\n\n==Relationship with international law==\n\nUnder [[international law]], rights and freedoms may be suspended during a state of emergency; for example, a government can detain persons and hold them without trial. All rights that can be derogated from are listed in the [[ICCPR|International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights]]. Non-derogable rights cannot be suspended.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} D. Pr\u00e9mont, C. Stenersen, I. Oseredczuk, Bruylant, Brussels, ''Droits intangibles et \u00e9tats d'exception''[fr.] 1996, 644p., {{ISBN|2-8027-0766-3}}, \u00c9ditions ''Bruylant''</ref>  Non-derogable rights are listed in Article 4 of the ICCPR; they include [[right to life]], the rights to freedom from [[arbitrary detention|arbitrary deprivation of liberty]], [[slavery]], [[torture]], and [[cruel and unusual punishment|ill-treatment]].<ref>Article 4, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</ref>\n\nSome countries have made it illegal to modify emergency law or the constitution during the emergency; other countries have the freedom to change any legislation or rights based constitutional frameworks at any time that the legislative chooses to do so. Constitutions are contracts between the government and the private individuals of that country. The International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) is an international law document signed and ratified by states.  Therefore, the Covenant applies to only those persons acting in an [[official capacity]], not private individuals. However, States Parties to the Covenant are expected to integrate it into national legislation. The state of emergency (within the ICCPR framework) must be publicly declared and the Secretary-General of the [[United Nations]] and all other States Parties to the Covenant must be notified immediately, to declare the reason for the emergency, the date on which the emergency is to start, the derogations that may take place, with the timeframe of the emergency and the date in which the emergency is expected to finish. Although this is common protocol stipulated by the ICCPR, its monitoring Committee of experts has no sanction power and its recommendations are therefore not always strictly followed; enforcement is therefore better regulated by the American and European Conventions and Courts on human rights.<ref>{{in lang|it}} [https://www.academia.edu/12431137/stato_di_eccezione_ed_ordinamento_democratico {{lang|it|Declaratoria dello stato di emergenza e Consiglio supremo di difesa}} Nuovi studi politici, gennaio-giugno 2005, n. 1/2, p. 107].</ref>\n\n==Use and viewpoints==<!--Linked from 'Giorgio Agamben'-->\nThough fairly uncommon in democracies, [[dictatorship|dictatorial]] regimes often declare a state of emergency that is prolonged indefinitely for the life of the regime, or for extended periods of time so that derogations can be used to override human rights of their citizens usually protected by the International Covenant on Civil and political rights.<ref>See Judson, 2012, \"[http://otago.ourarchive.ac.nz/handle/10523/2279 Where is R2P grounded in international law]\".</ref> In some situations, [[martial law]] is also declared, allowing the [[military]] greater authority to act. In other situations, emergency is not declared and de facto measures taken or decree-law adopted by the government. Ms. [[Nicole Questiaux]] (France) and Mr. Leandro Despouy (Argentina), two consecutive [[United Nations Special Rapporteurs]], have recommended to the international community to adopt the following \"principles\" to be observed during a state or de facto situation of emergency : Principles of Legality, Proclamation, Notification, Time Limitation, Exceptional Threat, Proportionality, Non-Discrimination, Compatibility, Concordance and Complementarity of the Various Norms of International Law (cf. \"Question of Human Rights and State of Emergency\", E/CN.4/Sub.2/1997/19, at Chapter II; see also ''[[:fr:\u00e9tat d'exception|\u00e9tat d'exception]]'').\n\nArticle 4 to the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR), permits states to [[Derogation|derogate]] from certain rights guaranteed by the ICCPR in \"time of public emergency\". Any measures derogating from obligations under the Covenant, however, must be to only the extent required by the exigencies of the situation, and must be announced by the State Party to the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]]. The [[European Convention on Human Rights]]<ref>''[[European Convention on Human Rights]]'', Article 15</ref> and [[American Convention on Human Rights]]<ref>''[[American Convention on Human Rights]]'', Article 27</ref> have similar derogatory provisions. No derogation is permitted to the [[ILO Conventions|International Labour Conventions]].\n\nSome [[political theory|political theorists]], such as [[Carl Schmitt]], have argued that the [[Power (philosophy)|power]] to decide the initiation of the state of emergency defines [[sovereignty]] itself. In [[State of Exception (2005)|''State of Exception'' (2005)]], [[Giorgio Agamben]] criticized this idea, arguing that the mechanism of the state of emergency deprives certain people of their [[civil and political rights]], producing his interpretation of ''[[homo sacer]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Agamben|2005}}</ref>\n\n===Graduation===\nIn many [[democracy|democratic]] states there are a selection of [[constitutional law|legal]] definitions for specific states of emergency,<ref>[http://www.astho.org/Programs/Preparedness/Public-Health-Emergency-Law/Emergency-Authority-and-Immunity-Toolkit/Emergency-Declarations-and-Authorities-Fact-Sheet/ USA ASTHO Emergency toolkit fact sheet]</ref> when the [[constitution]] of the [[State (polity)|State]] is partially in abeyance depending on the nature of the perceived threat to the [[general public]]. In order of severity these may include:\n*[[Martial law]] when civil rights are severely restricted by the imposition of [[military force]] within a [[Sovereign state]], for example during a period of extreme threat of [[invasion]] or actual [[hostilities]] by foreign forces\n* [[state of siege]] when the civil rights of specified persons or groups such as [[activist|political activists]] are likely to be curtailed, for example to prevent an [[insurrection]] or organised acts of [[treason]] by suspected [[Agent provocateur|agents provocateurs]]\n* [[emergency|civil emergency]] dealing with [[disaster area]]s and requiring the deployment of extraordinary resources to contain dangerous situations such as [[natural disaster]]s or extensive [[Malice (law)|malicious]] [[property damage]] such as may occur during [[riot]]ing or by [[arson]]. As well as regular [[emergency service]]s sometimes [[military forces]] may be assigned to deliver aid under especially [[Emergency procedure#Escalating Situations|dangerous conditions]] or to prevent [[looting]]\n\n===Abuse===\nThe state of emergency can be [[abuse]]d by being invoked. An example would be to allow a state to suppress internal opposition without having to respect human rights. An example was the [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|August 1991 attempted coup]] in the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR) where the coup leaders invoked a state of emergency; the failure of the coup led to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].\n\nDerogations by states having ratified or acceded to binding international agreements such as the ICCPR, the American and European Conventions on Human Rights and the International Labour Conventions are monitored by independent expert committees, regional Courts and other State Parties.<ref name=BBC />\n\n==Law in selected countries==\n\n===Argentina===\nThe Constitution, which has been amended several times, has always allowed for a state of emergency (literally ''estado de sitio'', \"state of siege\"), to be declared if the constitution or the authorities it creates are endangered by internal unrest or foreign attack. This provision was much abused during dictatorships, with long-lasting states of siege giving the government a free hand to suppress opposition ({{As of|2010|lc=on}} a state of emergency had been declared 52 times by democratic and dictatorial governments, starting in 1854 shortly after the constitution came into force<ref>{{cite web|url=http://derecho.laguia2000.com/derecho-politico/estado-de-sitio |title=State of emergency in Argentina and other Spanish-speaking countries (in Spanish) |publisher=Derecho.laguia2000.com |date=22 February 1999 |accessdate=29 March 2011}}</ref>). The [[American Convention on Human Rights]] (Pacto de San Jos\u00e9 de Costa Rica), adopted in 1969 but ratified by Argentina only in 1984 immediately after the end of the [[National Reorganization Process]], restricts abuse of the state of emergency by requiring any signatory nation declaring such a state to inform the other signatories of its circumstances and duration, and what rights are affected.\n\n===Australia===\n{{also|Exceptional circumstances|Biosecurity in Australia|Biosecurity Act 2015}}\nState-of-emergency legislation differs in each state of Australia. With regard to emergency management, regions (usually on a [[local government area]] basis) that have been affected by a [[natural disaster]] are the responsibility of the state, until that state declares a State of Emergency where access to the Federal Emergency Fund becomes available to help respond to and recover from natural disasters. A State of Emergency does not apply to the whole state, but rather [[districts]] or [[shire]]s, where essential services may have been disrupted.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], the [[premier of Victoria|premier]] can declare a state of emergency if there is a threat to employment, safety or public order.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/03/victoria-fires-state-of-disaster-declared-as-evacuation-ordered-and-second-man-found-dead Victorian fires: state of disaster declared as evacuation ordered and 28 people missing]</ref> The declaration expires after 30 days, and a resolution of either the upper or lower House of Parliament may revoke it earlier.

Any violation of a constitutional right must be strictly required by the emergency. Emergency measures may not indemnify the government or individuals for illegal actions. They may impose criminal penalties, but not exceeding three years' imprisonment. They may not require military service beyond that required by the ordinary laws governing the defence force. An emergency measure may be disapproved by the National Assembly, in which case it lapses, and no emergency measure may interfere with the elections, powers or sittings of [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]] or the [[provincial legislature (South Africa)|provincial legislatures]].

A friend or family member of the detainee must be informed, and the name and place of detention must be published in the ''Government Gazette''. The detainee must have access to a doctor and a legal representative. He or she must be brought before a court within at most ten days, for the court to determine whether the detention is necessary, and if not released may demand repeated review every ten days. At the court review the detainee must be allowed legal representation and must be allowed to appear in person.

It allows the modification of [[primary legislation]] by emergency regulation, with the exception of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] and Part 2 of the Civil Contingencies Act 2004.\n\n===United States===\n{{Further|Senate Report 93-549|Insurrection Act|National Emergencies Act|List of national emergencies in the United States}}\nThe [[United States Constitution]] implicitly provides some emergency powers in the article about the executive power :\n* Congress may authorize the government to call forth the militia to execute the laws, suppress an insurrection or repel an invasion.\n* Congress may authorize the government to suspend consideration of writs of ''[[Habeas corpus in the United States|habeas corpus]]'' \"when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.\"\n* [[Felony]] charges may be brought without presentment or [[grand jury]] [[indictment]] in cases arising \"in the militia, when in actual service in time of war or public danger.\"\n* A state government may engage in war without Congress's approval if \"actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay.\"\n\nAside from these, many provisions of law exist in various jurisdictions, which take effect only upon an executive declaration of emergency; some 500 federal laws take effect upon a presidential declaration of emergency. The [[National Emergencies Act]] regulates this process at the federal level. It requires the President to specifically identify the provisions activated and to renew the declaration annually so as to prevent an arbitrarily broad or open-ended emergency.\nPresidents have occasionally taken action justified as necessary or prudent because of a state of emergency, only to have the action struck down in court as unconstitutional.<ref>''[[Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer]]'' (1953)</ref>\n\nA state [[Governor (United States)|governor]] or local [[mayor]] may declare a state of emergency within his or her [[jurisdiction]]. This is common at the state level in response to natural disasters. The [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] maintains a system of assets, personnel and training to respond to such incidents. For example, on 10 December 2015, [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state Governor [[Jay Inslee]] declared a state of emergency due to flooding and landslides caused by heavy rains.<ref>{{cite news|title=Washington gov. declares weather emergency|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/12/10/washington-gov-declares-weather-emergency/77081310/|accessdate=10 December 2015|work=USA Today|date=10 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe 1977 [[International Emergency Economic Powers Act]] allows the government to freeze assets, limit trade and confiscate property in response to an \"unusual and extraordinary threat\" to the United States that originates substantially outside of it. As of 2015 more than twenty emergencies under the IEEPA remain active regarding various subjects, the oldest of which was declared in 1979 with regard to the government of [[Iran]]. Another ongoing national emergency, declared after the [[September 11 attacks]], authorizes the president to retain or reactivate military personnel beyond their normal term of service.<ref>US Presidential Proclamation 7463</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n<!--\n    Natural disasters happen all the time.

A government can declare such a state during a [[natural disaster]], [[civil unrest]], [[armed conflict]], medical [[pandemic]] or [[epidemic]] or other [[biosecurity]] risk. Such declarations alert citizens to change their normal behavior and orders government agencies to implement emergency plans. ''[[Justitium]]'' is its equivalent in Roman law&mdash;a concept in which the senate could put forward a final decree ([[senatus consultum ultimum]]) that was not subject to dispute.\n\nStates of emergency can also be used as a rationale or pretext for suspending rights and freedoms guaranteed under a country's [[constitution]] or [[basic law]], sometimes through [[martial law]] or revoking [[habeas corpus]]. The procedure for and legality of doing so vary by country.\n\n==Relationship with international law==\n\nUnder [[international law]], rights and freedoms may be suspended during a state of emergency; for example, a government can detain persons and hold them without trial. All rights that can be derogated from are listed in the [[ICCPR|International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights]]. Non-derogable rights cannot be suspended.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} D. Pr\u00e9mont, C. Stenersen, I. Oseredczuk, Bruylant, Brussels, ''Droits intangibles et \u00e9tats d'exception''[fr.] 1996, 644p., {{ISBN|2-8027-0766-3}}, \u00c9ditions ''Bruylant''</ref>  Non-derogable rights are listed in Article 4 of the ICCPR; they include [[right to life]], the rights to freedom from [[arbitrary detention|arbitrary deprivation of liberty]], [[slavery]], [[torture]], and [[cruel and unusual punishment|ill-treatment]].<ref>Article 4, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</ref>\n\nSome countries have made it illegal to modify emergency law or the constitution during the emergency; other countries have the freedom to change any legislation or rights based constitutional frameworks at any time that the legislative chooses to do so. Constitutions are contracts between the government and the private individuals of that country. The International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) is an international law document signed and ratified by states.  Therefore, the Covenant applies to only those persons acting in an [[official capacity]], not private individuals. However, States Parties to the Covenant are expected to integrate it into national legislation. The state of emergency (within the ICCPR framework) must be publicly declared and the Secretary-General of the [[United Nations]] and all other States Parties to the Covenant must be notified immediately, to declare the reason for the emergency, the date on which the emergency is to start, the derogations that may take place, with the timeframe of the emergency and the date in which the emergency is expected to finish. Although this is common protocol stipulated by the ICCPR, its monitoring Committee of experts has no sanction power and its recommendations are therefore not always strictly followed; enforcement is therefore better regulated by the American and European Conventions and Courts on human rights.<ref>{{in lang|it}} [https://www.academia.edu/12431137/stato_di_eccezione_ed_ordinamento_democratico {{lang|it|Declaratoria dello stato di emergenza e Consiglio supremo di difesa}} Nuovi studi politici, gennaio-giugno 2005, n. 1/2, p. 107].</ref>\n\n==Use and viewpoints==<!--Linked from 'Giorgio Agamben'-->\nThough fairly uncommon in democracies, [[dictatorship|dictatorial]] regimes often declare a state of emergency that is prolonged indefinitely for the life of the regime, or for extended periods of time so that derogations can be used to override human rights of their citizens usually protected by the International Covenant on Civil and political rights.<ref>See Judson, 2012, \"[http://otago.ourarchive.ac.nz/handle/10523/2279 Where is R2P grounded in international law]\".</ref> In some situations, [[martial law]] is also declared, allowing the [[military]] greater authority to act. In other situations, emergency is not declared and de facto measures taken or decree-law adopted by the government. Ms. [[Nicole Questiaux]] (France) and Mr. Leandro Despouy (Argentina), two consecutive [[United Nations Special Rapporteurs]], have recommended to the international community to adopt the following \"principles\" to be observed during a state or de facto situation of emergency : Principles of Legality, Proclamation, Notification, Time Limitation, Exceptional Threat, Proportionality, Non-Discrimination, Compatibility, Concordance and Complementarity of the Various Norms of International Law (cf. \"Question of Human Rights and State of Emergency\", E/CN.4/Sub.2/1997/19, at Chapter II; see also ''[[:fr:\u00e9tat d'exception|\u00e9tat d'exception]]'').\n\nArticle 4 to the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR), permits states to [[Derogation|derogate]] from certain rights guaranteed by the ICCPR in \"time of public emergency\". Any measures derogating from obligations under the Covenant, however, must be to only the extent required by the exigencies of the situation, and must be announced by the State Party to the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]]. The [[European Convention on Human Rights]]<ref>''[[European Convention on Human Rights]]'', Article 15</ref> and [[American Convention on Human Rights]]<ref>''[[American Convention on Human Rights]]'', Article 27</ref> have similar derogatory provisions. No derogation is permitted to the [[ILO Conventions|International Labour Conventions]].\n\nSome [[political theory|political theorists]], such as [[Carl Schmitt]], have argued that the [[Power (philosophy)|power]] to decide the initiation of the state of emergency defines [[sovereignty]] itself. In [[State of Exception (2005)|''State of Exception'' (2005)]], [[Giorgio Agamben]] criticized this idea, arguing that the mechanism of the state of emergency deprives certain people of their [[civil and political rights]], producing his interpretation of ''[[homo sacer]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Agamben|2005}}</ref>\n\n===Graduation===\nIn many [[democracy|democratic]] states there are a selection of [[constitutional law|legal]] definitions for specific states of emergency,<ref>[http://www.astho.org/Programs/Preparedness/Public-Health-Emergency-Law/Emergency-Authority-and-Immunity-Toolkit/Emergency-Declarations-and-Authorities-Fact-Sheet/ USA ASTHO Emergency toolkit fact sheet]</ref> when the [[constitution]] of the [[State (polity)|State]] is partially in abeyance depending on the nature of the perceived threat to the [[general public]]. In order of severity these may include:\n*[[Martial law]] when civil rights are severely restricted by the imposition of [[military force]] within a [[Sovereign state]], for example during a period of extreme threat of [[invasion]] or actual [[hostilities]] by foreign forces\n* [[state of siege]] when the civil rights of specified persons or groups such as [[activist|political activists]] are likely to be curtailed, for example to prevent an [[insurrection]] or organised acts of [[treason]] by suspected [[Agent provocateur|agents provocateurs]]\n* [[emergency|civil emergency]] dealing with [[disaster area]]s and requiring the deployment of extraordinary resources to contain dangerous situations such as [[natural disaster]]s or extensive [[Malice (law)|malicious]] [[property damage]] such as may occur during [[riot]]ing or by [[arson]]. As well as regular [[emergency service]]s sometimes [[military forces]] may be assigned to deliver aid under especially [[Emergency procedure#Escalating Situations|dangerous conditions]] or to prevent [[looting]]\n\n===Abuse===\nSometimes, the state of emergency can be [[abuse]]d by being invoked. An example would be to allow a state to suppress internal opposition without having to respect human rights. An example was the [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|August 1991 attempted coup]] in the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR) where the coup leaders invoked a state of emergency; the failure of the coup led to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].\n\nDerogations by states having ratified or acceded to binding international agreements such as the ICCPR, the American and European Conventions on Human Rights and the International Labour Conventions are monitored by independent expert committees, regional Courts and other State Parties.<ref name=BBC />\n\n==Law in selected countries==\n\n===Argentina===\nThe Constitution, which has been amended several times, has always allowed for a state of emergency (literally ''estado de sitio'', \"state of siege\"), to be declared if the constitution or the authorities it creates are endangered by internal unrest or foreign attack. This provision was much abused during dictatorships, with long-lasting states of siege giving the government a free hand to suppress opposition ({{As of|2010|lc=on}} a state of emergency had been declared 52 times by democratic and dictatorial governments, starting in 1854 shortly after the constitution came into force<ref>{{cite web|url=http://derecho.laguia2000.com/derecho-politico/estado-de-sitio |title=State of emergency in Argentina and other Spanish-speaking countries (in Spanish) |publisher=Derecho.laguia2000.com |date=22 February 1999 |accessdate=29 March 2011}}</ref>). The [[American Convention on Human Rights]] (Pacto de San Jos\u00e9 de Costa Rica), adopted in 1969 but ratified by Argentina only in 1984 immediately after the end of the [[National Reorganization Process]], restricts abuse of the state of emergency by requiring any signatory nation declaring such a state to inform the other signatories of its circumstances and duration, and what rights are affected.\n\n===Australia===\n{{also|Exceptional circumstances|Biosecurity in Australia|Biosecurity Act 2015}}\nState-of-emergency legislation differs in each state of Australia. With regard to emergency management, regions (usually on a [[local government area]] basis) that have been affected by a [[natural disaster]] are the responsibility of the state, until that state declares a State of Emergency where access to the Federal Emergency Fund becomes available to help respond to and recover from natural disasters. A State of Emergency does not apply to the whole state, but rather [[districts]] or [[shire]]s, where essential services may have been disrupted.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], the [[premier of Victoria|premier]] can declare a state of emergency if there is a threat to employment, safety or public order.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/03/victoria-fires-state-of-disaster-declared-as-evacuation-ordered-and-second-man-found-dead Victorian fires: state of disaster declared as evacuation ordered and 28 people missing]</ref> The declaration expires after 30 days, and a resolution of either the upper or lower House of Parliament may revoke it earlier.

This situation can be enforced in case of [[natural disasters]] or [[civil unrest]].\n* State of emergency (''stare de urgent\u0103'' in Romanian): Can only be enforced by the [[President of Romania]] with approval from [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]].

The [[President of South Africa|President]] may declare a state of emergency only when \"the life of the nation is threatened by war, invasion, general insurrection, disorder, natural disaster or other public emergency\" and if the ordinary laws and government powers are not sufficient to restore peace and order. The declaration is made by [[proclamation]] in the ''[[Government Gazette of South Africa|Government Gazette]]'' and may only apply from the time of publication, not retroactively. It can only continue for 21 days unless the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]] grants an extension, which may be for at most three months at a time.

This power can be delegated to other authorities. Emergency measures can violate the [[Bill of Rights (South Africa)|Bill of Rights]], but only to a limited extent. Some rights are inviolable, including amongst others the rights to life and to human dignity; the prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of race, sex or religion; the prohibition of torture or inhuman punishment; and the right of accused people to a fair trial. Any violation of a constitutional right must be strictly required by the emergency. Emergency measures may not indemnify the government or individuals for illegal actions. They may impose criminal penalties, but not exceeding three years' imprisonment. They may not require military service beyond that required by the ordinary laws governing the defence force. An emergency measure may be disapproved by the National Assembly, in which case it lapses, and no emergency measure may interfere with the elections, powers or sittings of [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]] or the [[provincial legislature (South Africa)|provincial legislatures]]. The courts have the power to determine the validity of any emergency measure.\n\nThe constitution places strict limits on any [[detention without trial]] during a state of emergency. A friend or family member of the detainee must be informed, and the name and place of detention must be published in the ''Government Gazette''. The detainee must have access to a doctor and a legal representative. He or she must be brought before a court within at most ten days, for the court to determine whether the detention is necessary, and if not released may demand repeated review every ten days. At the court review the detainee must be allowed legal representation and must be allowed to appear in person. The provisions on detention without trial do not apply to [[prisoners of war]] in an international conflict; instead they must be treated in accordance with the [[Geneva Conventions]] and other international law.\n\n===Spain===\nIn Spain, there are three degrees of state of emergency (''estado de emergencia'' in Spanish): ''[[State of Alarm|alarma]]'' (alarm or alert), ''excepci\u00f3n'' (exception[al circumstance]) and ''sitio'' (siege).

A larger number of soldiers or of a longer duration is subject to [[Federal Assembly (Switzerland)|parliamentary]] decision. For deployments within Switzerland the principle of subsidiarity rules: as a first step, unrest has to be overcome with the aid of cantonal police units.\n\n===Syria===\nAn emergency prevailed in [[Syria]] from 1962 to 2011. Originally predicated on the [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict|conflict with Israel]], the emergency acted to centralize authority in the presidency and the national security apparatus while silencing public dissent. The emergency was terminated in response to protests that preceded the [[Syrian Civil War]]. Under the 2012 constitution, the president may pass an emergency decree with a 2/3 concurrence of his ministers, provided that he presents it to the legislature for constitutional review.\n\n===Trinidad and Tobago===\nA state of emergency was declared in 1970 during the [[Black Power Revolution]] by then Prime Minister [[Eric Williams]].

On 4 September the Parliament extended the state of emergency for a further 3 months. It ended in December 2011.\n\n===Turkey===\n{{Main|Martial law and state of emergency in Turkey}}\nSince the foundation of the Republic of Turkey in 1923 the [[Turkish Armed Forces|military]] conducted three [[coup d'\u00e9tat|''coups d'\u00e9tat'']] and announced [[martial law]]. Martial law between 1978 and 1983 was replaced by a state of emergency that lasted until November 2002.\nThe latest state of emergency was declared by [[Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan|President Erdo\u011fan]] on 20 July 2016 following a failed coup attempt on 15 July 2016 by a faction of the country's armed forces. It was lifted in 2018.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{main|Civil Contingencies Act 2004}}\nIn the United Kingdom, only the [[British Sovereign]],<ref>The sovereign of the UK always follows the advice of the Prime Minister on any action with constitutional significance</ref> on the advice of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]], or a [[Minister of the Crown]] in exceptional circumstances, has the power to introduce emergency regulations under the [[Civil Contingencies Act 2004]], in case of an emergency, broadly defined as war or attack by a foreign power, terrorism which poses a threat of serious damage to the security of the UK, or events which threaten serious damage to human welfare or the environment of a place in the UK. The duration of these regulations is limited to thirty days, but may be extended by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]].\nA state of emergency was last invoked in 1974 by Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]] in response to increasing [[industrial action]].\n\nThe act grants wide-ranging powers to central and local government in the event of an emergency. It allows the modification of [[primary legislation]] by emergency regulation, with the exception of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] and Part 2 of the Civil Contingencies Act 2004.\n\n===United States===\n{{Further|Senate Report 93-549|Insurrection Act|National Emergencies Act|List of national emergencies in the United States}}\nThe [[United States Constitution]] implicitly provides some emergency powers in the article about the executive power :\n* Congress may authorize the government to call forth the militia to execute the laws, suppress an insurrection or repel an invasion.\n* Congress may authorize the government to suspend consideration of writs of ''[[Habeas corpus in the United States|habeas corpus]]'' \"when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.\"\n* [[Felony]] charges may be brought without presentment or [[grand jury]] [[indictment]] in cases arising \"in the militia, when in actual service in time of war or public danger.\"\n* A state government may engage in war without Congress's approval if \"actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay.\"\n\nAside from these, many provisions of law exist in various jurisdictions, which take effect only upon an executive declaration of emergency; some 500 federal laws take effect upon a presidential declaration of emergency. The [[National Emergencies Act]] regulates this process at the federal level. It requires the President to specifically identify the provisions activated and to renew the declaration annually so as to prevent an arbitrarily broad or open-ended emergency.\nPresidents have occasionally taken action justified as necessary or prudent because of a state of emergency, only to have the action struck down in court as unconstitutional.<ref>''[[Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer]]'' (1953)</ref>\n\nA state [[Governor (United States)|governor]] or local [[mayor]] may declare a state of emergency within his or her [[jurisdiction]]. This is common at the state level in response to natural disasters. The [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] maintains a system of assets, personnel and training to respond to such incidents. For example, on 10 December 2015, [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state Governor [[Jay Inslee]] declared a state of emergency due to flooding and landslides caused by heavy rains.<ref>{{cite news|title=Washington gov. declares weather emergency|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/12/10/washington-gov-declares-weather-emergency/77081310/|accessdate=10 December 2015|work=USA Today|date=10 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe 1977 [[International Emergency Economic Powers Act]] allows the government to freeze assets, limit trade and confiscate property in response to an \"unusual and extraordinary threat\" to the United States that originates substantially outside of it. As of 2015 more than twenty emergencies under the IEEPA remain active regarding various subjects, the oldest of which was declared in 1979 with regard to the government of [[Iran]].

{"title_page": "Gender inequality in the United States", "text_new": "{{Use mdy dates|date=October 2019}}\n{{Feminism sidebar |expanded=Waves}}\n'''Gender inequality in the United States''' has been diminishing throughout its history and significant advancements towards equality have been made beginning mostly in the early 1900s. However, despite this progress, gender inequality in the United States continues to persist in many forms, including the disparity in women's political representation and participation, [[occupational segregation]], and the unequal distribution of [[Homemaking|household labor]]. The alleviation of gender inequality has been the goal of several major pieces of legislation since 1920 and continues to the present day. As of 2018, the [[World Economic Forum]] ranks the United States 51st in terms of [[gender equality]] out of 149 countries.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GGGR_2018.pdf|title=The Global Gender Gap Report 2018|website=[[World Economic Forum]]|isbn=978-2-940631-00-1|access-date=April 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the inequality faced by transgender women, inequality, prejudice, and violence against [[transgender]] men and women, as well as gender nonconforming individuals and [[non-binary gender|non-binary]] individuals, are also prevalent in the United States. Transgender individuals suffer from prejudices in the workforce and employment, higher levels of domestic violence, higher rates of hate crimes, especially murder, and higher levels of [[police brutality in the United States|police brutality]] when compared to the cisgender population.<ref name=\"lgbtdiscrim\"/><ref name=\"domestic\"/><ref name=\"NCAVP\"/>\n\n==Current issues for  women==\n\n===Social attitudes===\nMore recent research in 2011 has found that attitudes towards gender and societal roles have changed very little since the mid-1990s, with attitudes hovering at about sixty to seventy percent egalitarian. This study theorized that a \"egalitarian but traditional\" gender frame emerged in popular culture during this period, which supports each gender assuming their traditional roles without appearing sexist or discriminatory, and is responsible for this backlash.<ref name=\"The End of the Gender Revolution? Gender Role Attitudes from 1977 to 2008\"/>\n\n[[Benevolent sexism]], sometimes referred to as chivalry, which holds women as something to be protected, also has psychological effects. Women who hold these views are more likely to have less ambitious career goals and men who hold these views tend to have a polarized and stereotyped view of women, made up of both very favorable and very unfavorable traits.<ref name=\"An Ambivalent Alliance: Hostile and Benevolent Sexism as Complementary Justifications for Gender Inequality\"/><ref name=bsexism /> In such cases, the stereotyped view of women is \"favorable in content and yet prejudicial in [its] consequences,\" and attempts to provide justification for discriminatory behaviors presented as helpful or paternal.<ref name=\"bsexism\"/>\n\n====Sexual assault====\nResearch conducted at [[Lycoming College]] has found the enjoyment of sexist humor to be strongly correlated with sexual aggression towards women among male college students.<ref name=\"The Enjoyment of Sexist Humor, Rape Attitudes, and Relationship Aggression in College Students\"/>  In addition, studies have shown that exposure  to sexist humor, particularly humor related to sexual assault, can increase male aggression and their tendency to discriminate against women.<ref name=\"sexisthumor1\"/><ref name=\"sexisthumor2\"/>  One study also asserted that the attitudes behind such humor creates an environment where such discriminatory and possibly violent behavior is acceptable.<ref name=sexisthumor1 /> Men's tendency to self-report the likelihood that they would commit sexually violent acts has also been found to increase after exposure to sexist humor, as reported by researchers from the [[University of Kent]].<ref name=sexisthumor2 />\n\n===Political participation===\n[[File:1974-2018. Women running for US House and Senate. And results.gif|thumb|upright=1.7|Women running for Congress]]\nThe [[Eagleton Institute of Politics#The Center for American Women and Politics|Center for American Women and Politics]] reports that, as of 2013, 18.3% of congressional seats are held by women and 23% of statewide elective offices are held by women; while the percentage of Congress made up of women has steadily increased, statewide elective positions held by women have decreased from their peak of 27.6% in 2001. Women also make up, as of 2013, 24.2% of state legislators in the United States. Among the one hundred largest cities in the United States, ten had female mayors as of 2013.<ref name=\"Women in Elective Office 2013\"/>\n\nIn 1977, political science professor [[Susan Welch]] presented three possible explanations for this underrepresentation of women in politics: one, that women are socialized to avoid careers in politics; two, that women's responsibilities in the home keep them away out of both the work force and the political arena; and three, women are more often than men members of other demographic groups with low political participation rates.<ref name=\"Women as Political Animals? A Test of Some Explanations for Male-Female Political Participation Differences\"/> In 2001, M. Margaret Conway, political science professor at the [[University of Florida]], also presented three possible explanations for the continuation of this disparity: one, similar to Welch's first explanation, sociological and societal norm discourages women from running; two, women less frequently acquire the necessary skills to hold a political leadership position from nonpolitical activities; and three, gatekeeping in party politics prevents women from running.<ref name=\"Women and political participation\"/>\n\n===Workplace Inequality===\n\nThe United States is falling behind other [[Western world|Western]] countries in the percentage of women engaged in the workforce.<ref name=\"IWPR\"/> Researchers from the [[Institute for Women's Policy Research]] at the [[University of California]] [[Hastings College of Law]] argue that this growing gap is due to a lack of governmental, business and societal support for working women. They ranked the United States last out of 20 industrialized countries in an index that measured such programs as [[family leave]], [[flextime|alternative work arrangements]], part-time employment, and other means to make workplaces more flexible and family-friendly.<ref name=\"IWPR\"/> The United States is also the only industrialized nation that does not have a paid parental leave policy mandated by law, and is one of only four countries worldwide that does not; in addition, fully paid maternity leave is only offered by around 16 percent of employers in the United States.<ref name=\"paternalleave\"/>\n\n====Sex discrimination in employment====\nJane Wilke from the [[University of Connecticut]] found that men's support the idea that men should be the sole source of income in a married couple decreased from 32 to 21 percent from 1972 to 1989; in practice only 15 percent of households were supported by a male spouse's income alone at the time of the study.<ref name=\"CHANGES IN U.S. MEN'S ATTITUDES TOWARD THE FAMILY PROVIDER ROLE, 1972-1989\"/>\n\nWomen continuously are being mistreated and sexually discriminated against explicitly in the workplace today. This has been an ongoing issue and will continue until something changes in the occupational sphere. According to a study conducted by researchers at [[California State University, Northridge]], when an individual with a PhD applies for a position at a university, that individual is significantly more likely to be offered a higher level of appointment, receive an offer of an academic position leading to tenure, and be offered a full professorship if they are a man when compared to a woman of comparable qualifications.<ref name=\"Empirical verification of sex discrimination in hiring practices in psychology.\"/> However, these findings have been disputed, with multiple studies finding universities pushed to hire more women, resulting in females being given a 2:1 advantage over males in science, technology engineering and mathematics fields.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=Wendy M.|last2=Ceci|first2=Stephen J.|title=National hiring experiments reveal 2:1 faculty preference for women on STEM tenure track|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=April 28, 2015|volume=112|issue=17|pages=5360\u20135365|doi=10.1073/pnas.1418878112|pmid=25870272|language=en|issn=0027-8424|pmc=4418903|bibcode=2015PNAS..112.5360W}}</ref>\n\nAnother study found that women were significantly less likely to receive a job offer or an interview for a high-paying waiter position when compared to equally qualified men; this study also found that such hiring discrimination may be caused in part by customer's discrimination of preference for male wait staff, but that it could not be concluded, since the male/female gap could be explained by the fact that more female waiters than male, such that the preferred hiring of male waiters could actually help equality.<ref name=\"Sex Discrimination in Restaurant Hiring: An Audit Study\"/> Similarly, research conducted at the [[University of California, Davis]] focusing on academic dermatology revealed a significant downward trend in the number of women receiving funding from the National Institutes of Health, which the authors concluded was due to a lack of support for women scientists at their home institutions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cheng|first=Michelle A.|author2=Annie Sukhov |author3=Hawa Sultani |author4=Koungmi Kim |author5=Emanual Maverakis |title=Trends in National Institutes of Health Funding of Principal Investigators in Dermatology Research by Academic Degree and Sex|journal=JAMA Dermatology|volume=152|issue=8|pages=883\u2013888|date=May 2016|doi=10.1001/jamadermatol.2016.0271|pmid=27191545|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nResearch from [[Lawrence University]] has found that men were more likely to be hired in traditionally masculine jobs, such as sales management, and women were more likely to be hired in traditionally feminine jobs, such as receptionist or secretary. However, individuals of either gender with masculine personality traits were advantaged when applying for either masculine or feminine jobs, indicating a possibly valuing of stereotypically male traits above stereotypically female traits.<ref name=\"What mediates sex discrimination in hiring decisions?\"/>\n\n====Occupational segregation by gender====\n{{main|Occupational segregation}}\nOccupational gender segregation takes the form of both horizontal segregation (the unequal gender distribution across occupations) and vertical segregation (the overrepresentation of men in higher positions in both traditionally male and traditionally female fields).<ref name=\"sexsegregation\"/>\n\nAccording to [[Sandy Darity, Jr.|William A. Darity, Jr.]] and Patrick L. Mason, there is a strong horizontal occupational division in the United States on the basis of gender; in 1990, the index of occupational dissimilarity was 53%, meaning 53% of women or 47% of men would have to move to a different career field in order for all occupations to have equal gender composition.<ref name=\"darity\"/> While women have begun to more frequently enter traditionally male-dominated professions, there have been much fewer men entering female-dominated professions; professor of sociology Paula England cites this horizontal segregation of careers as a contributing factor to the gender pay gap.<ref name=\"Gender Inequality in Labor Markets: The Role of Motherhood and Segregation\"/>\n\n=====Housework=====\n[[File:Woman cleaning toilets.jpg|thumb|[[:File:Cleaning the Toilet (TESDA).webm|Cleaning a toilet]] in [[Sumas, Washington]].

Women are, on average, more concerned about undone housework, an attitude gap that has been attributed to [[socialization]] and societies that hold women responsible for the state of the home.

Another topic of discussion regarding the gender pay gap is the racial pay gap that exists in our country today. Not only are women discriminated against for their gender, but also women are discriminated against for their race. The racial pay gap in the workplace is just another aspect of the pay gap issue that our society needs to overcome as soon as possible. Overall, different groups of women experience distinct gaps in pay in the workplace due to solely their race.<ref name=\"aauw.org\"/>\n\n====== Asian ======\nGenerally, among women of all ethnicities and races, the hourly earnings of Asian and white women tend to be higher than African American and Hispanic women <ref name=\"Despite\">{{cite web |last1=Patten |first1=Eileen |title=Racial, gender wage gaps persist in U.S. despite some progress |url=https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/01/racial-gender-wage-gaps-persist-in-u-s-despite-some-progress/ |website=Pew Research Center |accessdate=April 7, 2019}}</ref> A 2016 study by the [[Pew Research Center]] reported that Asian women, on average, receive about 18 dollars an hour, while white women earn 17 dollars, African American women get 13 dollars, and Hispanic women receive 12 dollars.<ref name=\"Despite\"/> The study also found that in 2015 Asian women earned about 87 cents per dollar earned by white men in median hourly earnings.<ref name=\"Despite\"/>  About 45 percent of Asian American mothers provide nearly 40 percent of their families' income, making these households reliant on this income.<ref>{{cite web |title=Asian American and Pacific Island Women and the Wage Gap |url=http://www.nationalpartnership.org/our-work/resources/workplace/fair-pay/asian-women-and-the-wage-gap.pdf |website=National Partnership for Women and Families |accessdate=April 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====== Hispanic/Latino ======\nFemale Hispanic or Latino women earn wages far less than their women and male counterparts. According to the Institute for Women's Policy Research, in 2017, the median salary for a white male was $60,388, $46,513 for white women, and 32,002 for Latina women. They earn the lowest among all ethnicities including Asian and Black women workers. In 2017, for every 1 dollar a white male worker earns, a Hispanic woman earns 53 cents. Whereas, the white female employee makes 80.5 cents for each dollar a man makes. That is 47 per cent less than white males and 31 per cent less than white females.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hegewisch |first1=Ariane |title=The Gender Wage Gap: 2017; Earnings Differences by Gender, Race, and Ethnicity |url=https://iwpr.org/publications/gender-wage-gap-2017/ |website=Institute for Women's Policy Research |accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> The Institute for Women's Policy Research stated that in 2016, 31.2 per cent of Latina women were unmarried and the primary provider for their family and 21.3 per cent were married and still the families' primary source of income.

In sales, the median wage for white men is $20.12, whereas Latinas earn $11.44. In customer service, they earn $14.24, while their male counterparts earn $19.89.

However, the several subgroups that pertain to women show how race, alongside gender, cause innate disadvantages in the workplace for certain individuals. In general, a woman would have to work nearly four extra months per year in order to earn the same annual salary an average man receives. For Native American women specifically, equal pay would not be received for an extra nine months per year.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Connley |first1=Courtney |title=Reminder: Today isn't Equal Pay Day for all women |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/10/today-isnt-equal-pay-day-for-black-latina-or-native-american-women.html |website=CNBC |publisher=CNBC |accessdate=April 7, 2019}}</ref> This notion is supported by the fact that the average Native American female earns approximately $0.58 per every individual dollar a white male earns.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Business Staff |first1=Native |title=Today Marks Equal Pay Day \u2014 But Native American Women Still Earn 57 Cents on the Dollar |url=https://www.nativebusinessmag.com/today-marks-equal-pay-day-but-native-american-women-still-earn-57-cents-on-the-dollar/ |website=Native Business |accessdate=April 7, 2019}}</ref> In comparison, a white woman earns $0.77 per each dollar earned by a white male. Historical wage disparities that derived from the unequal treatment of races from years prior still persist. This is argued as dangerous because it can also stem from the unequal placement of racial groups in specific neighborhoods, thus resulting in inferior education. In turn, this can be one of the causes, alongside discrimination, for why Native American women experience a larger than normal wage disparity. As well, this continues neighborhood association causes a continuous cycle of a more impoverished lifestyle for Native Americans. The annual wage gap between a Native American woman and a white woman is approximately $24,443.<ref name=\"AmericaWomen\">{{cite web |title=America's Women and the Wage Gap |url=http://www.nationalpartnership.org/our-work/resources/workplace/fair-pay/americas-women-and-the-wage-gap.pdf |website=National Partnership for Woman and Families |publisher=National Partnership for Woman and Families}}</ref>\n\nGiven the fact that woman in general are already at an alarming wage gap compared to men, this large number indicates a serious disparity and large role race also plays in wage disparities within genders. As a benchmark, the median annual pay in the United States for a full-time, year round working Native American woman is $33,571.<ref name=\"AmericaWomen\"/> This, alongside the fact that 67% of Native American mothers are breadwinners, or in other words the person who's wages support the family, shows how the wage disparity has a direct effect on the impoverished lifestyle of certain racial groups.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Boushey |first1=Heather |title=Families Can't Afford the Gender Wage Gap |url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/news/2010/04/20/7707/families-cant-afford-the-gender-wage-gap/ |website=Center for American Progress |accessdate=April 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====== Caucasian ======\nThe pay gap between Caucasian women and Caucasian men is substantial. In 2018, the median weekly pay for all Caucasian women with full-time job was $789 while the median weekly pay for men was $973. These numbers depict that on average, white women make around 81% of what white men do. While these numbers clearly describe the inequality between white men and white women, the pay gap between them is much closer than other races including Hispanic, Native American, American Indian and Native Hawaiian.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Vagins |first1=Deborah |title=The Simple Truth about the Gender Pay Gap |url=https://www.aauw.org/research/the-simple-truth-about-the-gender-pay-gap/ |website=AAUW}}</ref> New awareness of gender inequality in the workplace has caused the annual earnings for women to increase by 1.6% from 2016\u20132017. While women's median annual earnings may not increase significantly every year, it is generally on an upward trend.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hegewisch |first1=Ariane |title=The Gender Wage Gap: 2017 Earnings Differences by Race and Ethnicity |url=https://iwpr.org/publications/gender-wage-gap-2017-race-ethnicity/ |website=Institute for Women's Policy Research}}</ref>\n\nOne of the biggest factors that leads to the gap between white men and women is parenting. While many white women are staying home to take care of their family, men are continuing to work and earn money. When white women eventually go back to work,  their average earnings decrease around 39% compared to women who were not parenting a child.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hayes |first1=Abby |title=OPINION: Gender Pay Gap \u2013 Statistics, Trends, Reasons and Solutions |url=https://www.doughroller.net/personal-finance/the-employment-battle-of-men-vs-women/ |website=DoughRoller}}</ref> If the government were to implement free child care services, women would have a greater opportunity to work.  Despite the gradual decrease in pay gap between men and women, the government needs to implement more laws so that this pay gap eventually disappears. A big difference in the salary earnings between Caucasian men and women is due to job titles and experience. Despite these differences, studies have shown that women will make $.98 to every man's $1 even if they have the same exact job title and experience.<ref>{{cite web |title=THE STATE OF THE GENDER PAY GAP 2019 |url=https://www.payscale.com/data/gender-pay-gap |website=PayScale}}</ref> This is a prime example of the inequalities Caucasian women face in the workforce. Despite all of these inequalities for Caucasian women in the workplace, there are many ways to reduce the pay gap. One way the government can help women even the playing field would be to add mentoring programs. These programs could help women negotiate their salaries and working conditions.<ref>{{cite web |title=How to Decrease Gender Pay Gap in 7 Steps |url=https://www.market-inspector.co.uk/blog/2017/06/decrease-gender-pay-gap |website=Market Inspector}}</ref>\n\n====== African American ======\nAs of 2017, African American women make 61 cents to the white man's dollar.<ref name=\"AAUW\">{{cite web |last1=Nelson |first1=Raina |title=Black Women and the Pay Gap |url=https://www.aauw.org/article/black-women-and-the-pay-gap/ |website=AAUW |publisher=AAUW |accessdate=April 7, 2019}}</ref> This is much lower than the earnings ratio for all women in this country, which is 80 cents to the white man's dollar.<ref name=\"AAUW\"/> According to data from the Economic Policy Institute, the median earnings of full-time, full- year workers for black men is about $5,000 higher than the earnings of Black women.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gould |first1=Elsie |title=Black workers have made no progress in closing earnings gaps with white men since 2000 |url=https://www.epi.org/blog/black-workers-have-made-no-progress-in-closing-earnings-gaps-with-white-men-since-2000/ |website=Economic Policy Institute |publisher=Economic Policy Institute |accessdate=April 7, 2019}}</ref> So even within their own race they also receive the lower end of the stick. In the top 25 states with the largest numbers of Black women working full-time, year-round, the pay compared to white men ranges from about 48 to 68 cents for every dollar. For example, in places like Washington, D.C. and Mississippi, Black women still only make 55 cents to the white man's dollar even though they have the highest share of full-time working black women.<ref name=\"BlackWomen\">{{cite web |title=Black Women and the Wage Gap |url=http://www.nationalpartnership.org/our-work/resources/workplace/fair-pay/african-american-women-wage-gap.pdf |website=National Partnership for Women and Families |publisher=National Partnership for Women and Families |accessdate=April 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Black female pay disparity is worth paying attention to because 80% of Black women are the sole source of income in their households. 4 million Black women are reported to be the heads of their households. Of this 4 million, 1.2 million are living below the poverty line.<ref name=\"BlackWomen\"/>\n\nThere are many reasons why these disparities exist. Black women are more likely to be found occupying lower paying service jobs than any other demographic, meaning that the chances of finding them in engineering or managerial positions, higher paying jobs, is very slim.<ref name=\"AAUW\"/> Only 2.2% of all board seats in Fortune 500 companies are held by Black women. Very few black women advance to executive leadership positions due to lack of finding other black women in those positions to be a mentor or to network with, which is something that their white counterparts have more access to.<ref name=\"Catalyst\">{{cite web |last1=Gordon |first1=Tia |title=No, Black Women Still Don't Earn The Same As Their White Peers.

When comparing average math test scores of boys and girls in kindergarten, they did not discover an average gender gap. However, when looking at data from students in second or third grade, the researchers discovered that boys perform better on the math tests (by a standard deviation of 0.25 average gender gap).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brown-center-chalkboard/2018/04/23/how-our-education-system-undermines-gender-equity/|title=How our education system undermines gender equity|last=Cimpian|first=Joseph|date=April 23, 2018|website=Brookings|language=en-US|access-date=April 7, 2019}}</ref> The researchers also found that when teachers were asked to compare a boy and a girl of the same socio-economic status and race who received the same scores on math tests and had similar behavioral records in school, teachers overwhelmingly stated that the boy had superior mathematical abilities, a finding replicated in a study over a decade later.<ref name=\":2\" /> It is therefore possible that the gender gap in mathematical abilities among kindergarteners could be much less apparent in the United States today if teachers exhibited less gender bias in evaluating students' abilities, as evidenced by these replicated studies that demonstrate a systematic undervaluing of girls\u2019 mathematical abilities by teachers, which has likely contributed to a false perception of girls\u2019 abilities as being lower than test scores would indicate.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nFrom kindergarten through college, girls on average spend more time studying and receive better grades than their boy peers. However, 95% of the executive directors and CEOs in the largest public companies in the United States remain men.<ref name=\":3\" /> Researchers believe that this stark gender disparity is due to a lack of confidence in girls rather than a lack of competence.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/opinion/sunday/girls-school-confidence.html|title=Opinion {{!}} Why Girls Beat Boys at School and Lose to Them at the Office|last=Damour|first=Lisa|date=February 7, 2019|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 7, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Most men, even those who may be underprepared or less qualified, never hesitate to pursue leadership roles or advancement in their careers. However, most women, even those who are overly qualified and overly prepared hold back from pursuing leadership roles or advancement. This lack of confidence in girls stems from their early years of education.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nStarting in elementary school, boys will often do the minimum amount of work needed to pass. When boys succeed in school by putting in a very small amount of effort, they become extremely confident in their abilities. During elementary, middle, and high school, boys continue to become more confident in their abilities and rely on their intelligence to succeed. However, girls slave over their homework, notes, and study materials until they are absolutely perfect. For example, girls will complete extra credit even when they have an A+ in the class. Especially as they enter middle and high school, girls become extremely anxious about their schoolwork and devote hours and hours to perfecting their assignments and acing their tests. Some stress is normal and healthy, however, being overly-stressed at all points of the day (as many young girls are) is not healthy. As adolescent girls work vigorously on their homework assignments, they develop competence but not confidence. Girls will attribute their success to external factors while boys will attribute their success to their own intelligence. In the workforce, confidence often goes farther than competence. When girls enter the workforce, they are competent in their field, but lack confidence to seek promotions or advancement. Thus, the lack of female leadership roles is partially due to the socialization of girls and boys beginning in elementary school.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nWhen favoritism occurs in the classroom, the majority of teachers declare they do not purposefully favor one gender over another. Research demonstrates that teachers end up silencing girls in their classes. Oftentimes, girls are rewarded in school for good behavior. Usually, this means sitting silently and attentively in class. However, these types of rewards can have very negative societal consequences. When girls are taught to be silent in class, they will often remain silent in the greater years of their life. The fact that young girls are commended to be silent may be the reason that they do not speak up when they are older, especially in serious cases such as sexual assault.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2018/10/10/teacher-year-how-schools-silence-girls-how-i-played-part/?noredirect=on|title=Teacher of the year: How schools silence girls \u2014 and how I played a part|last=Strauss|first=Valerie|date=October 10, 2018|website=Washington Post|access-date=April 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\nResearch also shows teachers divide time unequally between boys and girls. They ask boys more questions, provide them with more feedback, and allow them to speak out of turn more often. Conversely, teachers do not call on girls as much, which causes them to raise their hands less frequently. Research shows that teachers will spend 65% more of their time speaking with male students than female students. Additionally, they will allow boys to interrupt girls more often than they allow girls to interrupt boys. At the same time, girls are praised for being orderly and quiet in class. Research has also found that teachers give boys more chances to exhibit their knowledge to the class and they will often look at boys (instead of girls) after posing a question to the class. For female students of color (specifically African American female students), the problem is even worse. African American female students are 6 times more likely to be disciplined in school than white female students. They are often told that they are \u201cdefiant\u201d and \u201cdisobedient\u201d. These biases that girls face from such a young age engrain an understanding in their mind that gender inequality is normal.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nDuring a study of almost 20,000 young students, only 8% of females and 4% of males favored female leaders in politics. The results of this study demonstrate that from such a young age, girls are trained to believe that men are better leaders than they are. This knowledge never leaves them and hurts them as they enter the workforce. Additionally, dress code is a school policy that has very serious emotional consequences for young girls. They feel as though they are constantly being judged, especially by male faculty members. In this case, when boys watch girls receive praise for being silent, they begin to always expect silence from their female classmates. When boys speak up the most in class, they start to internalize the idea that their opinions are more important than their female classmates\u2019 opinions, and they begin to internalize the idea that it is okay to interrupt girls in class.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nSo often in our society, girls receive signals from an early age that they are not good at math, or that boys are simply better. This can occur at home, when wives ask their husbands for help when it comes to math. In 2013, women received 57% of all bachelor's degrees, however they only received 43% of math degrees, 19% of engineering degrees, and 18% of computer science degrees. At school and at home, many young girls receive the message that they either \u201chave the math gene or they do not.\u201d When a mother tells her daughter that she wasn't good at math in school, oftentimes, the daughter's mathematical achievement will decrease. Oftentimes, women do not realize they are sending these messages to their daughters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2016/10/12/health/female-scientists-engineers-math-gender-gap/index.html|title=How 'boys are better at math' mindset causes STEM gender gap|author=Kelly Wallace|website=CNN|access-date=April 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Gender differences in degree choices ====\nSpecific to university and college campuses, gender inequalities can be seen when looking into the demographics of particular majors. This initial entrance into a particular field of study is shaped by an individual's desires to take a certain set of classes, leading to somewhat specific career opportunities and subsequently, salaries. When exploring the depths of college majors, there is a tendency for each gender to cluster into certain majors. These stereotypical \u201cmasculine\u201d and \u201cfeminine\u201d degrees are key indicators to the inequalities women face in certain fields, specifically within the sciences and mathematics. Based on the Department of Education collections of data from the College Class of 2015, \u201cwomen earn the large majority of degrees in health professions, psychology, education, English and communication, while men earn the large majority of degrees in engineering, computer science, and theology.\u201d<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.aei.org/publication/table-of-the-day-bachelors-degrees-by-field-and-gender-for-the-class-of-2015/|title=Table of the day: Bachelor's degrees by field and gender for the Class of 2015|date=August 7, 2017|website=AEI|language=en-US|access-date=April 7, 2019}}</ref> These exact percentages can be seen in the table distributed by the Department of Education, exemplifying the overall majority men have in the STEM field.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAlthough not designated for specific genders, majors and minors at universities and colleges carry different stigmas for who should/shouldn't be part of the program. The results of Sylvia Beyer's 1995 study surveying 154 female and 111 male students from the University of Wisconsin-Parkside, to test the accuracy of gender stereotypes, conclude that students believe men and women are concentrated in different fields and that specific majors are deemed \u201cmasculine\u201d and \u201cfeminine.\u201d<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Beyer|first=Sylvia|date=1999|journal=Sex Roles|title=The Accuracy of Academic Gender Stereotypes|volume=40|issue=9/10|pages=787\u2013813|doi=10.1023/a:1018864803330|issn=0360-0025}}</ref> The participants categorized the masculine majors with computer science, chemistry, business, history, and mathematics, while they placed the feminine majors as psychology, communication, music, and art. These perceptions may not accurately describe the gender percentages in each field, but prove that men are more likely to be seen in STEM concentrations than women. Additionally, Yale researchers have published studies which prove that young male scientists are more likely to be favored than female scientists with the same candidacy. As of 2013, only \u2155 of Physics PHDs were awarded to women and only 14% of physics professors were female.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/06/magazine/why-are-there-still-so-few-women-in-science.html|title=Why Are There Still So Few Women in Science?|last=Pollack|first=Eileen|date=October 3, 2013|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 7, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> A large factor in the major and minor inequalities seen at the college level come from the encouragement of peers and educators to go forth in certain subjects. Ultimately, women are not receiving the same support and backing as their male counterparts, and thus, do not pursue STEM fields. Since a large sum of money lies in these occupations, women are not receiving an equal share, further perpetuating gendered salary inequalities.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Gender inequality in graduate school expectations ====\nAccording to researchers at the University of Mississippi, undergraduate women have higher rates of expected educational attainment than men at the bachelors, masters, professional, and PhD degree levels. Women also report higher rates of marriage, desire to be married, parenthood, and lower average age of expected marriage. The study links these higher rates of a desire to have children with higher expectations for educational attainment at the masters and professional degree levels for females. Respondents who indicate they are likely to stay at home to help care for their children are less likely to expect a master's degree, professional degree, or PhD compared to those expecting to solely acquire a bachelor's degree. The latter category of respondents contains higher rates of women than men (by a ratio greater than 10:1) due to societal norms in the United States for women to take care of children in the family.<ref name=\"GradSchool\">{{Cite journal|last=Allison|first=Rachel|last2=Ralston|first2=Margaret|date=2018|title=Gender, Anticipated Family Formation, and Graduate School Expectations Among Undergraduates|journal=Sociological Forum|language=en|volume=33|issue=1|pages=95\u2013117|doi=10.1111/socf.12400|issn=1573-7861}}</ref> Child-rearing may account for a contributing cause of inequality in educational outcomes among men and women in the United States.\n\nThe research shows negative associations between both marriage and expectations of achieving a master's degree or PhD, and having children and expectations of achieving professional degrees or PhDs for women, but not men. A larger positive association was found between anticipated age at parenthood and an expectation to achieve a graduate or professional degree for women than for men. The relationship between expected age of marriage and expectation to achieve a\u00a0PhD was also higher for women.<ref name=\"GradSchool\" /> While women earned a majority of total graduate school degrees in 2016 (57.5% female compared to 42.5% male), men still earned more graduate degrees among higher-paying disciplines, such as in business (54.9% male compared to 45.1% female), engineering, (75.3% male compared to 24.7% female) and mathematics and computer science (68.5% male compared to 31.5% female).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aei.org/publication/women-earned-majority-of-doctoral-degrees-in-2016-for-8th-straight-year-and-outnumber-men-in-grad-school-135-to-100/|title=Women earned majority of doctoral degrees in 2016 for 8th straight year and outnumber men in grad school 135 to 100|date=September 28, 2017|website=AEI|language=en-US|access-date=April 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Gender inequality in representation at elite institutions ====\nWomen have recently surpassed men in the ratio of students enrolled in colleges around the nation. In 2017, women were awarded a majority of doctoral degrees, at 53%, for the ninth year in a row.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=December 5, 2017|title=Annual income earned by men and women by country, 2015|journal=The Missing Entrepreneurs 2017|doi=10.1787/9789264283602-graph20-en|isbn=9789264283596|author1=Oecd|last2=Union|first2=European|series=The Missing Entrepreneurs|doi-access=free}}</ref> With striking progress from the late 1900s, gender inequality in higher education persists with the consideration of female representation at elite universities.\n\nThe higher representation of women is largely attributed to schools with \u201chigher acceptance rates, lower faculty/student ratios, lower standardized test scores, and lower fees\u201d; thus, underrepresentation still persists amongst the top schools in the nation. The effects of a less-notable degree proceed to play out in the workplace and job recruiting processes. Scholars have reasoned this inequality to be the effect of part-time enrollment and the advanced engineering characteristic of elite universities.<ref name=\"Gender Inequality and Higher Education\" /> With fewer females enrolling in STEM programs, they are less likely to attend universities notable for these programs. Other scholars argue that gender inequality at elite institutions is not an issue of access, accrediting the issue to decentralized school systems,<ref name=\"Gender Inequality and Higher Education\" /> such as the existence of female-only universities (which individually draw a large segment of women attending college).\n\n==== Gender inequality in faculty ====\nWomen in academia face many challenges in terms of pay, rank, and composition in faculty. Although female faculty members\u2019 salaries are gradually increasing, the pay gap continues to widen or remain unchanged. The reason for this lies in the fact that male faculty members already earn significantly more than their female counterparts. The wage gap is greatest in private independent colleges. The explanations that have been brought forward for this persistent disparity relate to women's positions in institutions and disciplines. Within doctoral-granting institutions, containing the highest salary scales, women are outnumbered two to one.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Renzulli |first1=Linda A. |last2=Grant |first2=Linda |last3=Kathuria |first3=Sheetija |title=Race, Gender, and the Wage Gap: Comparing Faculty Salaries in Predominately White and Historically Black Colleges and Universities |journal=Gender and Society |date=2006 |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=491\u2013510 |issn=0891-2432|jstor=27640906 |doi=10.1177/0891243206287130 }}</ref> Women are extremely underrepresented in high-paying academic disciplines, like science, business, and law, yet overrepresented in low-paying fields, such as English, romance languages, and education.

On top of receiving incorrect treatment, when seeking treatment for autoimmune disorders which affect more women than men. It takes an average of seeking care from five different doctors and a span of 4 years to receive a diagnosis (Miller). Women's health has come a long way and with help from the FDA and NIH making new policies to include more research gender specific for women, the gap is slowly closing.<ref>Miller, Kenneth. \u201cHow Health Care Fails Women.\u201d Prevention 70, no. 6, June 2018, p46- https://www.prevention.com/health/a22022580/how-health-care-fails-women/.

According to the [[National Center for Transgender Equality]], \"only one-fifth (21%) of transgender people who have transitioned in the National Transgender Discrimination Survey have been able to update all of their IDs and records with their new gender and one-third (33%) had updated none of their IDs or records.

transgender women, a considerable increase from the percentage of transgender women victims in 2011 at 40%.<ref name=\"NCAVP\"/> In addition, the report also found that, compared to cisgender people, transgender people were more than three times more likely to experience police violence.<ref name=\"NCAVP\"/>\n\nIn terms of mental health, transgender individuals have much higher rates of suicide attempts than cisgender individuals and it has been reported that between nineteen and twenty-five of the trans population have attempted suicide.<ref name=\"Suicide and suicide risk in lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender populations: review and recommendations.\"/>\n\n==Government policy==\nIn 1920, the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which insured women's suffrage (although some individual states allowed women the right to vote as early as 1869), was ratified. In addition, the Women's Bureau of the Department of Labor was created to monitor working conditions for women in the workforce.<ref name=\"Timeline1\"/>\n\nIn 1961, the [[President's Commission on the Status of Women]] was started, initially chaired by [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]. This commission found that women were suffering considerable workplace discrimination. In 1963, the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963|Equal Pay Act]] was passed, which made it illegal for a woman to be paid less than a man working in the same position. The [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] also made discriminatory hiring on the basis of gender illegal. The [[affirmative action]] policy of 1965 was expanded in 1967 to cover women as well as racial minorities. In 1973, women's right to safe and legal abortion was established by the Supreme Court's ruling in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''. In 1968, sex-segregated job advertisements were declared illegal by the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]], this decision was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1973; this allowed women to apply for higher-paying jobs formally restricted only to male applicants. In 1972, [[Title IX]] of the [[Education Amendments of 1972|Education Amendments]], which reads \"No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any educational program or activity receiving federal financial assistance,\" was passed.<ref name=\"timeline2\"/>\n\nIn 1986, in the decision of ''[[Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson]]'', sexual harassment was established as illegal and discriminatory.<ref name =timeline3 /> The [[Family Medical Leave Act]] of 1993 guarantees that new parents can retain their jobs for 12 weeks after the birth of the child; this unpaid leave is the only form of paternal leave protected by law in the United States.<ref name=paternalleave /> In 1994, the [[Violence Against Women Act]] provided legal protection, as well as funds and services, for rape victims and victims of domestic violence. ''[[United States v. Virginia]]'' established in 1996 that gender-based admission practices violated the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], and establishing a separate all-female school would not suffice as an alternative to integrating an all-male school. Most recently, in 2009 the [[Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009]] provides employees (usually female) who suffer from pay discrimination to file a complaint with the government.<ref name=\"timeline3\"/>\n\nThe [[Equal Rights Amendment]], which reads, \"Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex\", was first introduced to Congress in 1923 and successfully passed both houses of Congress in 1972. However, it failed to be ratified by an adequate number of states and died in 1982.<ref name=timeline2 /> The United States is one of only a few countries which have not [[ratified]] the UN [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] (US has only signed the treaty).<ref name=\"UNTC\"/>\n\n==Rankings==\nThe [[World Economic Forum]]'s [[Gender Gap Index]]  for 2012 ranked United States 22nd best out of 135 countries for [[gender equality]].<ref name=\"ggusa\"/><ref name=\"Global Gender Gap Report 2012: The Best And Worst Countries For Women\"/> The primary indicators for inequality were related to political empowerment, where the US was ranked 55th (32nd for women in ministerial position and 78th for women in parliament).<ref name=ggusa/> USA was ranked 33rd for health and survival, 8th for economic participation and opportunity, and tied for 1st (no inequality) in education.<ref name=ggusa/> Since the Gender Gap report was first published in 2006, the US position remains relatively stable in that index.<ref name=ggusa/> However, the United States' score decreased between 2011 and 2012.<ref name=ggusa/><ref name=\"businessinsider\"/>\n\n[[United Nation]]'s [[Gender Inequality Index]] (part of the [[Human Development Report]]) shows that the US scored 19% in gender inequality in 2017 ranking in the13th place out of 173 countries in terms of the Human Development Index.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/indicators/137506|title={{!}} Human Development Reports|website=hdr.undp.org|access-date=September 23, 2019}}</ref> In addition, the [[OECD]]'s Better Life Index discusses a number of differences, but does not stress any in particular when it comes to gender.<ref name=\"Gender and Inequality: How the U.S. Stacks Up Against Other OECD Countries\"/><ref name=\"United States \u2013 OECD Better Life Index\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Affirmative action]]\n* [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]]\n* [[Double burden]]\n* [[Education Amendments of 1972]], [[Title IX]]\n* [[Employment discrimination law in the United States]]\n* [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]]\n* [[Equal Rights Amendment]]\n* [[Gender inequality]] \n* [[Gender role]]\n* [[Lilly Ledbetter]]\n* [[Work-family balance in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"ATTITUDES TOWARD WOMEN'S FAMILIAL ROLES:: Changes in the United States, 1977-1985\">{{cite journal|last1=Mason|first1=K.

However, despite this progress, gender inequality in the United States continues to persist in many forms, including the disparity in women's political representation and participation, [[occupational segregation]], and the unequal distribution of [[Homemaking|household labor]]. The alleviation of gender inequality has been the goal of several major pieces of legislation since 1920 and continues to the present day. As of 2018, the [[World Economic Forum]] ranks the United States 51st in terms of [[gender equality]] out of 149 countries.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GGGR_2018.pdf|title=The Global Gender Gap Report 2018|website=[[World Economic Forum]]|isbn=978-2-940631-00-1|access-date=April 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the inequality faced by transgender women, inequality, prejudice, and violence against [[transgender]] men and women, as well as gender nonconforming individuals and [[non-binary gender|non-binary]] individuals, are also prevalent in the United States. Transgender individuals suffer from prejudices in the workforce and employment, higher levels of domestic violence, higher rates of hate crimes, especially murder, and higher levels of [[police brutality in the United States|police brutality]] when compared to the cisgender population.<ref name=\"lgbtdiscrim\"/><ref name=\"domestic\"/><ref name=\"NCAVP\"/>\n\n==Current issues for  women==\n\n===Social attitudes===\nMore recent research in 2011 has found that attitudes towards gender and societal roles have changed very little since the mid-1990s, with attitudes hovering at about sixty to seventy percent egalitarian. This study theorized that a \"egalitarian but traditional\" gender frame emerged in popular culture during this period, which supports each gender assuming their traditional roles without appearing sexist or discriminatory, and is responsible for this backlash.<ref name=\"The End of the Gender Revolution? Gender Role Attitudes from 1977 to 2008\"/>\n\n[[Benevolent sexism]], sometimes referred to as chivalry, which holds women as something to be protected, also has psychological effects. Women who hold these views are more likely to have less ambitious career goals and men who hold these views tend to have a polarized and stereotyped view of women, made up of both very favorable and very unfavorable traits.<ref name=\"An Ambivalent Alliance: Hostile and Benevolent Sexism as Complementary Justifications for Gender Inequality\"/><ref name=bsexism /> In such cases, the stereotyped view of women is \"favorable in content and yet prejudicial in [its] consequences,\" and attempts to provide justification for discriminatory behaviors presented as helpful or paternal.<ref name=\"bsexism\"/>\n\n====Sexual assault====\nResearch conducted at [[Lycoming College]] has found the enjoyment of sexist humor to be strongly correlated with sexual aggression towards women among male college students.<ref name=\"The Enjoyment of Sexist Humor, Rape Attitudes, and Relationship Aggression in College Students\"/>  In addition, studies have shown that exposure  to sexist humor, particularly humor related to sexual assault, can increase male aggression and their tendency to discriminate against women.<ref name=\"sexisthumor1\"/><ref name=\"sexisthumor2\"/>  One study also asserted that the attitudes behind such humor creates an environment where such discriminatory and possibly violent behavior is acceptable.<ref name=sexisthumor1 /> Men's tendency to self-report the likelihood that they would commit sexually violent acts has also been found to increase after exposure to sexist humor, as reported by researchers from the [[University of Kent]].<ref name=sexisthumor2 />\n\n===Political participation===\n[[File:1974-2018. Women running for US House and Senate. And results.gif|thumb|upright=1.7|Women running for Congress]]\nThe [[Eagleton Institute of Politics#The Center for American Women and Politics|Center for American Women and Politics]] reports that, as of 2013, 18.3% of congressional seats are held by women and 23% of statewide elective offices are held by women; while the percentage of Congress made up of women has steadily increased, statewide elective positions held by women have decreased from their peak of 27.6% in 2001. Women also make up, as of 2013, 24.2% of state legislators in the United States. Among the one hundred largest cities in the United States, ten had female mayors as of 2013.<ref name=\"Women in Elective Office 2013\"/>\n\nIn 1977, political science professor [[Susan Welch]] presented three possible explanations for this underrepresentation of women in politics: one, that women are socialized to avoid careers in politics; two, that women's responsibilities in the home keep them away out of both the work force and the political arena; and three, women are more often than men members of other demographic groups with low political participation rates.<ref name=\"Women as Political Animals? A Test of Some Explanations for Male-Female Political Participation Differences\"/> In 2001, M. Margaret Conway, political science professor at the [[University of Florida]], also presented three possible explanations for the continuation of this disparity: one, similar to Welch's first explanation, sociological and societal norm discourages women from running; two, women less frequently acquire the necessary skills to hold a political leadership position from nonpolitical activities; and three, gatekeeping in party politics prevents women from running.<ref name=\"Women and political participation\"/>\n\n===Workplace Inequality===\n\nThe United States is falling behind other [[Western world|Western]] countries in the percentage of women engaged in the workforce.<ref name=\"IWPR\"/> Researchers from the [[Institute for Women's Policy Research]] at the [[University of California]] [[Hastings College of Law]] argue that this growing gap is due to a lack of governmental, business and societal support for working women. They ranked the United States last out of 20 industrialized countries in an index that measured such programs as [[family leave]], [[flextime|alternative work arrangements]], part-time employment, and other means to make workplaces more flexible and family-friendly.<ref name=\"IWPR\"/> The United States is also the only industrialized nation that does not have a paid parental leave policy mandated by law, and is one of only four countries worldwide that does not; in addition, fully paid maternity leave is only offered by around 16 percent of employers in the United States.<ref name=\"paternalleave\"/>\n\n====Sex discrimination in employment====\nJane Wilke from the [[University of Connecticut]] found that men's support the idea that men should be the sole source of income in a married couple decreased from 32 to 21 percent from 1972 to 1989; in practice only 15 percent of households were supported by a male spouse's income alone at the time of the study.<ref name=\"CHANGES IN U.S. MEN'S ATTITUDES TOWARD THE FAMILY PROVIDER ROLE, 1972-1989\"/>\n\nWomen continuously are being mistreated and sexually discriminated against explicitly in the workplace today. This has been an ongoing issue and will continue until something changes in the occupational sphere. According to a study conducted by researchers at [[California State University, Northridge]], when an individual with a PhD applies for a position at a university, that individual is significantly more likely to be offered a higher level of appointment, receive an offer of an academic position leading to tenure, and be offered a full professorship if they are a man when compared to a woman of comparable qualifications.<ref name=\"Empirical verification of sex discrimination in hiring practices in psychology.\"/> However, these findings have been disputed, with multiple studies finding universities pushed to hire more women, resulting in females being given a 2:1 advantage over males in science, technology engineering and mathematics fields.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=Wendy M.|last2=Ceci|first2=Stephen J.|title=National hiring experiments reveal 2:1 faculty preference for women on STEM tenure track|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=April 28, 2015|volume=112|issue=17|pages=5360\u20135365|doi=10.1073/pnas.1418878112|pmid=25870272|language=en|issn=0027-8424|pmc=4418903|bibcode=2015PNAS..112.5360W}}</ref>\n\nAnother study found that women were significantly less likely to receive a job offer or an interview for a high-paying waiter position when compared to equally qualified men; this study also found that such hiring discrimination may be caused in part by customer's discrimination of preference for male wait staff, but that it could not be concluded, since the male/female gap could be explained by the fact that more female waiters than male, such that the preferred hiring of male waiters could actually help equality.<ref name=\"Sex Discrimination in Restaurant Hiring: An Audit Study\"/> Similarly, research conducted at the [[University of California, Davis]] focusing on academic dermatology revealed a significant downward trend in the number of women receiving funding from the National Institutes of Health, which the authors concluded was due to a lack of support for women scientists at their home institutions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cheng|first=Michelle A.|author2=Annie Sukhov |author3=Hawa Sultani |author4=Koungmi Kim |author5=Emanual Maverakis |title=Trends in National Institutes of Health Funding of Principal Investigators in Dermatology Research by Academic Degree and Sex|journal=JAMA Dermatology|volume=152|issue=8|pages=883\u2013888|date=May 2016|doi=10.1001/jamadermatol.2016.0271|pmid=27191545|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nResearch from [[Lawrence University]] has found that men were more likely to be hired in traditionally masculine jobs, such as sales management, and women were more likely to be hired in traditionally feminine jobs, such as receptionist or secretary. However, individuals of either gender with masculine personality traits were advantaged when applying for either masculine or feminine jobs, indicating a possibly valuing of stereotypically male traits above stereotypically female traits.<ref name=\"What mediates sex discrimination in hiring decisions?\"/>\n\n====Occupational segregation by gender====\n{{main|Occupational segregation}}\nOccupational gender segregation takes the form of both horizontal segregation (the unequal gender distribution across occupations) and vertical segregation (the overrepresentation of men in higher positions in both traditionally male and traditionally female fields).<ref name=\"sexsegregation\"/>\n\nAccording to [[Sandy Darity, Jr.|William A. Darity, Jr.]] and Patrick L. Mason, there is a strong horizontal occupational division in the United States on the basis of gender; in 1990, the index of occupational dissimilarity was 53%, meaning 53% of women or 47% of men would have to move to a different career field in order for all occupations to have equal gender composition.<ref name=\"darity\"/> While women have begun to more frequently enter traditionally male-dominated professions, there have been much fewer men entering female-dominated professions; professor of sociology Paula England cites this horizontal segregation of careers as a contributing factor to the gender pay gap.<ref name=\"Gender Inequality in Labor Markets: The Role of Motherhood and Segregation\"/>\n\n=====Housework=====\n[[File:Woman cleaning toilets.jpg|thumb|[[:File:Cleaning the Toilet (TESDA).webm|Cleaning a toilet]] in [[Sumas, Washington]].

Another topic of discussion regarding the gender pay gap is the racial pay gap that exists in our country today. Not only are women discriminated against for their gender, but also women are discriminated against for their race.

Overall, different groups of women experience distinct gaps in pay in the workplace due to solely their race.<ref name=\"aauw.org\"/>\n\n====== Asian ======\nGenerally, among women of all ethnicities and races, the hourly earnings of Asian and white women tend to be higher than African American and Hispanic women <ref name=\"Despite\">{{cite web |last1=Patten |first1=Eileen |title=Racial, gender wage gaps persist in U.S. despite some progress |url=https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/01/racial-gender-wage-gaps-persist-in-u-s-despite-some-progress/ |website=Pew Research Center |accessdate=April 7, 2019}}</ref> A 2016 study by the [[Pew Research Center]] reported that Asian women, on average, receive about 18 dollars an hour, while white women earn 17 dollars, African American women get 13 dollars, and Hispanic women receive 12 dollars.<ref name=\"Despite\"/> The study also found that in 2015 Asian women earned about 87 cents per dollar earned by white men in median hourly earnings.<ref name=\"Despite\"/>  About 45 percent of Asian American mothers provide nearly 40 percent of their families' income, making these households reliant on this income.<ref>{{cite web |title=Asian American and Pacific Island Women and the Wage Gap |url=http://www.nationalpartnership.org/our-work/resources/workplace/fair-pay/asian-women-and-the-wage-gap.pdf |website=National Partnership for Women and Families |accessdate=April 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====== Hispanic ======\nFemale Hispanic women earn wages far less than their women and male counterparts. According to the Institute for Women's Policy Research, in 2017, the median salary for a white male was $60,388, $46,513 for white women, and 32,002 for Latina women. They earn the lowest among all ethnicities including Asian and Black women workers. In 2017, for every 1 dollar a white male worker earns, a Hispanic woman earns 53 cents.

However, the several subgroups that pertain to women show how race, alongside gender, cause innate disadvantages in the workplace for certain individuals. In general, a woman would have to work nearly four extra months per year in order to earn the same annual salary an average man receives. For Native American women specifically, equal pay would not be received for an extra nine months per year.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Connley |first1=Courtney |title=Reminder: Today isn't Equal Pay Day for all women |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/10/today-isnt-equal-pay-day-for-black-latina-or-native-american-women.html |website=CNBC |publisher=CNBC |accessdate=April 7, 2019}}</ref> This notion is supported by the fact that the average Native American female earns approximately $0.58 per every individual dollar a white male earns.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Business Staff |first1=Native |title=Today Marks Equal Pay Day \u2014 But Native American Women Still Earn 57 Cents on the Dollar |url=https://www.nativebusinessmag.com/today-marks-equal-pay-day-but-native-american-women-still-earn-57-cents-on-the-dollar/ |website=Native Business |accessdate=April 7, 2019}}</ref> In comparison, a white woman earns $0.77 per each dollar earned by a white male. Historical wage disparities that derived from the unequal treatment of races from years prior still persist. This is argued as dangerous because it can also stem from the unequal placement of racial groups in specific neighborhoods, thus resulting in inferior education. In turn, this can be one of the causes, alongside discrimination, for why Native American women experience a larger than normal wage disparity. As well, this continues neighborhood association causes a continuous cycle of a more impoverished lifestyle for Native Americans. The annual wage gap between a Native American woman and a white woman is approximately $24,443.<ref name=\"AmericaWomen\">{{cite web |title=America's Women and the Wage Gap |url=http://www.nationalpartnership.org/our-work/resources/workplace/fair-pay/americas-women-and-the-wage-gap.pdf |website=National Partnership for Woman and Families |publisher=National Partnership for Woman and Families}}</ref>\n\nGiven the fact that woman in general are already at an alarming wage gap compared to men, this large number indicates a serious disparity and large role race also plays in wage disparities within genders. As a benchmark, the median annual pay in the United States for a full-time, year round working Native American woman is $33,571.<ref name=\"AmericaWomen\"/> This, alongside the fact that 67% of Native American mothers are breadwinners, or in other words the person who's wages support the family, shows how the wage disparity has a direct effect on the impoverished lifestyle of certain racial groups.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Boushey |first1=Heather |title=Families Can't Afford the Gender Wage Gap |url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/news/2010/04/20/7707/families-cant-afford-the-gender-wage-gap/ |website=Center for American Progress |accessdate=April 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====== Caucasian ======\nThe pay gap between Caucasian women and Caucasian men is substantial. In 2018, the median weekly pay for all Caucasian women with full-time job was $789 while the median weekly pay for men was $973. These numbers depict that on average, white women make around 81% of what white men do. While these numbers clearly describe the inequality between white men and white women, the pay gap between them is much closer than other races including Hispanic, Native American, American Indian and Native Hawaiian.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Vagins |first1=Deborah |title=The Simple Truth about the Gender Pay Gap |url=https://www.aauw.org/research/the-simple-truth-about-the-gender-pay-gap/ |website=AAUW}}</ref> New awareness of gender inequality in the workplace has caused the annual earnings for women to increase by 1.6% from 2016\u20132017. While women's median annual earnings may not increase significantly every year, it is generally on an upward trend.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hegewisch |first1=Ariane |title=The Gender Wage Gap: 2017 Earnings Differences by Race and Ethnicity |url=https://iwpr.org/publications/gender-wage-gap-2017-race-ethnicity/ |website=Institute for Women's Policy Research}}</ref>\n\nOne of the biggest factors that leads to the gap between white men and women is parenting. While many white women are staying home to take care of their family, men are continuing to work and earn money. When white women eventually go back to work,  their average earnings decrease around 39% compared to women who were not parenting a child.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hayes |first1=Abby |title=OPINION: Gender Pay Gap \u2013 Statistics, Trends, Reasons and Solutions |url=https://www.doughroller.net/personal-finance/the-employment-battle-of-men-vs-women/ |website=DoughRoller}}</ref> If the government were to implement free child care services, women would have a greater opportunity to work.  Despite the gradual decrease in pay gap between men and women, the government needs to implement more laws so that this pay gap eventually disappears. A big difference in the salary earnings between Caucasian men and women is due to job titles and experience. Despite these differences, studies have shown that women will make $.98 to every man's $1 even if they have the same exact job title and experience.<ref>{{cite web |title=THE STATE OF THE GENDER PAY GAP 2019 |url=https://www.payscale.com/data/gender-pay-gap |website=PayScale}}</ref> This is a prime example of the inequalities Caucasian women face in the workforce. Despite all of these inequalities for Caucasian women in the workplace, there are many ways to reduce the pay gap. One way the government can help women even the playing field would be to add mentoring programs. These programs could help women negotiate their salaries and working conditions.<ref>{{cite web |title=How to Decrease Gender Pay Gap in 7 Steps |url=https://www.market-inspector.co.uk/blog/2017/06/decrease-gender-pay-gap |website=Market Inspector}}</ref>\n\n====== African American ======\nAs of 2017, African American women make 61 cents to the white man's dollar.<ref name=\"AAUW\">{{cite web |last1=Nelson |first1=Raina |title=Black Women and the Pay Gap |url=https://www.aauw.org/article/black-women-and-the-pay-gap/ |website=AAUW |publisher=AAUW |accessdate=April 7, 2019}}</ref> This is much lower than the earnings ratio for all women in this country, which is 80 cents to the white man's dollar.<ref name=\"AAUW\"/> According to data from the Economic Policy Institute, the median earnings of full-time, full- year workers for black men is about $5,000 higher than the earnings of Black women.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gould |first1=Elsie |title=Black workers have made no progress in closing earnings gaps with white men since 2000 |url=https://www.epi.org/blog/black-workers-have-made-no-progress-in-closing-earnings-gaps-with-white-men-since-2000/ |website=Economic Policy Institute |publisher=Economic Policy Institute |accessdate=April 7, 2019}}</ref> So even within their own race they also receive the lower end of the stick. In the top 25 states with the largest numbers of Black women working full-time, year-round, the pay compared to white men ranges from about 48 to 68 cents for every dollar. For example, in places like Washington, D.C. and Mississippi, Black women still only make 55 cents to the white man's dollar even though they have the highest share of full-time working black women.<ref name=\"BlackWomen\">{{cite web |title=Black Women and the Wage Gap |url=http://www.nationalpartnership.org/our-work/resources/workplace/fair-pay/african-american-women-wage-gap.pdf |website=National Partnership for Women and Families |publisher=National Partnership for Women and Families |accessdate=April 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Black female pay disparity is worth paying attention to because 80% of Black women are the sole source of income in their households. 4 million Black women are reported to be the heads of their households. Of this 4 million, 1.2 million are living below the poverty line.<ref name=\"BlackWomen\"/>\n\nThere are many reasons why these disparities exist. Black women are more likely to be found occupying lower paying service jobs than any other demographic, meaning that the chances of finding them in engineering or managerial positions, higher paying jobs, is very slim.<ref name=\"AAUW\"/> Only 2.2% of all board seats in Fortune 500 companies are held by Black women. Very few black women advance to executive leadership positions due to lack of finding other black women in those positions to be a mentor or to network with, which is something that their white counterparts have more access to.<ref name=\"Catalyst\">{{cite web |last1=Gordon |first1=Tia |title=No, Black Women Still Don't Earn The Same As Their White Peers.

When comparing average math test scores of boys and girls in kindergarten, they did not discover an average gender gap. However, when looking at data from students in second or third grade, the researchers discovered that boys perform better on the math tests (by a standard deviation of 0.25 average gender gap).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brown-center-chalkboard/2018/04/23/how-our-education-system-undermines-gender-equity/|title=How our education system undermines gender equity|last=Cimpian|first=Joseph|date=April 23, 2018|website=Brookings|language=en-US|access-date=April 7, 2019}}</ref> The researchers also found that when teachers were asked to compare a boy and a girl of the same socio-economic status and race who received the same scores on math tests and had similar behavioral records in school, teachers overwhelmingly stated that the boy had superior mathematical abilities, a finding replicated in a study over a decade later.<ref name=\":2\" /> It is therefore possible that the gender gap in mathematical abilities among kindergarteners could be much less apparent in the United States today if teachers exhibited less gender bias in evaluating students' abilities, as evidenced by these replicated studies that demonstrate a systematic undervaluing of girls\u2019 mathematical abilities by teachers, which has likely contributed to a false perception of girls\u2019 abilities as being lower than test scores would indicate.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nFrom kindergarten through college, girls on average spend more time studying and receive better grades than their boy peers.

However, most women, even those who are overly qualified and overly prepared hold back from pursuing leadership roles or advancement. This lack of confidence in girls stems from their early years of education.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nStarting in elementary school, boys will often do the minimum amount of work needed to pass. When boys succeed in school by putting in a very small amount of effort, they become extremely confident in their abilities. During elementary, middle, and high school, boys continue to become more confident in their abilities and rely on their intelligence to succeed. However, girls slave over their homework, notes, and study materials until they are absolutely perfect. For example, girls will complete extra credit even when they have an A+ in the class. Especially as they enter middle and high school, girls become extremely anxious about their schoolwork and devote hours and hours to perfecting their assignments and acing their tests. Some stress is normal and healthy, however, being overly-stressed at all points of the day (as many young girls are) is not healthy. As adolescent girls work vigorously on their homework assignments, they develop competence but not confidence. Girls will attribute their success to external factors while boys will attribute their success to their own intelligence. In the workforce, confidence often goes farther than competence. When girls enter the workforce, they are competent in their field, but lack confidence to seek promotions or advancement. Thus, the lack of female leadership roles is partially due to the socialization of girls and boys beginning in elementary school.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nWhen favoritism occurs in the classroom, the majority of teachers declare they do not purposefully favor one gender over another. Research demonstrates that teachers end up silencing girls in their classes. Oftentimes, girls are rewarded in school for good behavior. Usually, this means sitting silently and attentively in class. However, these types of rewards can have very negative societal consequences. When girls are taught to be silent in class, they will often remain silent in the greater years of their life. The fact that young girls are commended to be silent may be the reason that they do not speak up when they are older, especially in serious cases such as sexual assault.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2018/10/10/teacher-year-how-schools-silence-girls-how-i-played-part/?noredirect=on|title=Teacher of the year: How schools silence girls \u2014 and how I played a part|last=Strauss|first=Valerie|date=October 10, 2018|website=Washington Post|access-date=April 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\nResearch also shows teachers divide time unequally between boys and girls. They ask boys more questions, provide them with more feedback, and allow them to speak out of turn more often. Conversely, teachers do not call on girls as much, which causes them to raise their hands less frequently. Research shows that teachers will spend 65% more of their time speaking with male students than female students. Additionally, they will allow boys to interrupt girls more often than they allow girls to interrupt boys. At the same time, girls are praised for being orderly and quiet in class. Research has also found that teachers give boys more chances to exhibit their knowledge to the class and they will often look at boys (instead of girls) after posing a question to the class. For female students of color (specifically African American female students), the problem is even worse. African American female students are 6 times more likely to be disciplined in school than white female students. They are often told that they are \u201cdefiant\u201d and \u201cdisobedient\u201d. These biases that girls face from such a young age engrain an understanding in their mind that gender inequality is normal.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nDuring a study of almost 20,000 young students, only 8% of females and 4% of males favored female leaders in politics. The results of this study demonstrate that from such a young age, girls are trained to believe that men are better leaders than they are. This knowledge never leaves them and hurts them as they enter the workforce. Additionally, dress code is a school policy that has very serious emotional consequences for young girls. They feel as though they are constantly being judged, especially by male faculty members. In this case, when boys watch girls receive praise for being silent, they begin to always expect silence from their female classmates. When boys speak up the most in class, they start to internalize the idea that their opinions are more important than their female classmates\u2019 opinions, and they begin to internalize the idea that it is okay to interrupt girls in class.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nSo often in our society, girls receive signals from an early age that they are not good at math, or that boys are simply better. This can occur at home, when wives ask their husbands for help when it comes to math. In 2013, women received 57% of all bachelor's degrees, however they only received 43% of math degrees, 19% of engineering degrees, and 18% of computer science degrees. At school and at home, many young girls receive the message that they either \u201chave the math gene or they do not.\u201d When a mother tells her daughter that she wasn't good at math in school, oftentimes, the daughter's mathematical achievement will decrease. Oftentimes, women do not realize they are sending these messages to their daughters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2016/10/12/health/female-scientists-engineers-math-gender-gap/index.html|title=How 'boys are better at math' mindset causes STEM gender gap|author=Kelly Wallace|website=CNN|access-date=April 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Gender differences in degree choices ====\nSpecific to university and college campuses, gender inequalities can be seen when looking into the demographics of particular majors. This initial entrance into a particular field of study is shaped by an individual's desires to take a certain set of classes, leading to somewhat specific career opportunities and subsequently, salaries. When exploring the depths of college majors, there is a tendency for each gender to cluster into certain majors. These stereotypical \u201cmasculine\u201d and \u201cfeminine\u201d degrees are key indicators to the inequalities women face in certain fields, specifically within the sciences and mathematics. Based on the Department of Education collections of data from the College Class of 2015, \u201cwomen earn the large majority of degrees in health professions, psychology, education, English and communication, while men earn the large majority of degrees in engineering, computer science, and theology.\u201d<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.aei.org/publication/table-of-the-day-bachelors-degrees-by-field-and-gender-for-the-class-of-2015/|title=Table of the day: Bachelor's degrees by field and gender for the Class of 2015|date=August 7, 2017|website=AEI|language=en-US|access-date=April 7, 2019}}</ref> These exact percentages can be seen in the table distributed by the Department of Education, exemplifying the overall majority men have in the STEM field.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAlthough not designated for specific genders, majors and minors at universities and colleges carry different stigmas for who should/shouldn't be part of the program. The results of Sylvia Beyer's 1995 study surveying 154 female and 111 male students from the University of Wisconsin-Parkside, to test the accuracy of gender stereotypes, conclude that students believe men and women are concentrated in different fields and that specific majors are deemed \u201cmasculine\u201d and \u201cfeminine.\u201d<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Beyer|first=Sylvia|date=1999|journal=Sex Roles|title=The Accuracy of Academic Gender Stereotypes|volume=40|issue=9/10|pages=787\u2013813|doi=10.1023/a:1018864803330|issn=0360-0025}}</ref> The participants categorized the masculine majors with computer science, chemistry, business, history, and mathematics, while they placed the feminine majors as psychology, communication, music, and art. These perceptions may not accurately describe the gender percentages in each field, but prove that men are more likely to be seen in STEM concentrations than women. Additionally, Yale researchers have published studies which prove that young male scientists are more likely to be favored than female scientists with the same candidacy. As of 2013, only \u2155 of Physics PHDs were awarded to women and only 14% of physics professors were female.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/06/magazine/why-are-there-still-so-few-women-in-science.html|title=Why Are There Still So Few Women in Science?|last=Pollack|first=Eileen|date=October 3, 2013|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 7, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> A large factor in the major and minor inequalities seen at the college level come from the encouragement of peers and educators to go forth in certain subjects. Ultimately, women are not receiving the same support and backing as their male counterparts, and thus, do not pursue STEM fields. Since a large sum of money lies in these occupations, women are not receiving an equal share, further perpetuating gendered salary inequalities.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Gender inequality in graduate school expectations ====\nAccording to researchers at the University of Mississippi, undergraduate women have higher rates of expected educational attainment than men at the bachelors, masters, professional, and PhD degree levels. Women also report higher rates of marriage, desire to be married, parenthood, and lower average age of expected marriage. The study links these higher rates of a desire to have children with higher expectations for educational attainment at the masters and professional degree levels for females. Respondents who indicate they are likely to stay at home to help care for their children are less likely to expect a master's degree, professional degree, or PhD compared to those expecting to solely acquire a bachelor's degree. The latter category of respondents contains higher rates of women than men (by a ratio greater than 10:1) due to societal norms in the United States for women to take care of children in the family.<ref name=\"GradSchool\">{{Cite journal|last=Allison|first=Rachel|last2=Ralston|first2=Margaret|date=2018|title=Gender, Anticipated Family Formation, and Graduate School Expectations Among Undergraduates|journal=Sociological Forum|language=en|volume=33|issue=1|pages=95\u2013117|doi=10.1111/socf.12400|issn=1573-7861}}</ref> Child-rearing may account for a contributing cause of inequality in educational outcomes among men and women in the United States.\n\nThe research shows negative associations between both marriage and expectations of achieving a master's degree or PhD, and having children and expectations of achieving professional degrees or PhDs for women, but not men. A larger positive association was found between anticipated age at parenthood and an expectation to achieve a graduate or professional degree for women than for men. The relationship between expected age of marriage and expectation to achieve a\u00a0PhD was also higher for women.<ref name=\"GradSchool\" /> While women earned a majority of total graduate school degrees in 2016 (57.5% female compared to 42.5% male), men still earned more graduate degrees among higher-paying disciplines, such as in business (54.9% male compared to 45.1% female), engineering, (75.3% male compared to 24.7% female) and mathematics and computer science (68.5% male compared to 31.5% female).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aei.org/publication/women-earned-majority-of-doctoral-degrees-in-2016-for-8th-straight-year-and-outnumber-men-in-grad-school-135-to-100/|title=Women earned majority of doctoral degrees in 2016 for 8th straight year and outnumber men in grad school 135 to 100|date=September 28, 2017|website=AEI|language=en-US|access-date=April 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Gender inequality in representation at elite institutions ====\nWomen have recently surpassed men in the ratio of students enrolled in colleges around the nation. In 2017, women were awarded a majority of doctoral degrees, at 53%, for the ninth year in a row.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=December 5, 2017|title=Annual income earned by men and women by country, 2015|journal=The Missing Entrepreneurs 2017|doi=10.1787/9789264283602-graph20-en|isbn=9789264283596|author1=Oecd|last2=Union|first2=European|series=The Missing Entrepreneurs|doi-access=free}}</ref> With striking progress from the late 1900s, gender inequality in higher education persists with the consideration of female representation at elite universities.\n\nThe higher representation of women is largely attributed to schools with \u201chigher acceptance rates, lower faculty/student ratios, lower standardized test scores, and lower fees\u201d; thus, underrepresentation still persists amongst the top schools in the nation. The effects of a less-notable degree proceed to play out in the workplace and job recruiting processes. Scholars have reasoned this inequality to be the effect of part-time enrollment and the advanced engineering characteristic of elite universities.<ref name=\"Gender Inequality and Higher Education\" /> With fewer females enrolling in STEM programs, they are less likely to attend universities notable for these programs. Other scholars argue that gender inequality at elite institutions is not an issue of access, accrediting the issue to decentralized school systems,<ref name=\"Gender Inequality and Higher Education\" /> such as the existence of female-only universities (which individually draw a large segment of women attending college).\n\n==== Gender inequality in faculty ====\nWomen in academia face many challenges in terms of pay, rank, and composition in faculty. Although female faculty members\u2019 salaries are gradually increasing, the pay gap continues to widen or remain unchanged. The reason for this lies in the fact that male faculty members already earn significantly more than their female counterparts. The wage gap is greatest in private independent colleges. The explanations that have been brought forward for this persistent disparity relate to women's positions in institutions and disciplines. Within doctoral-granting institutions, containing the highest salary scales, women are outnumbered two to one.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Renzulli |first1=Linda A. |last2=Grant |first2=Linda |last3=Kathuria |first3=Sheetija |title=Race, Gender, and the Wage Gap: Comparing Faculty Salaries in Predominately White and Historically Black Colleges and Universities |journal=Gender and Society |date=2006 |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=491\u2013510 |issn=0891-2432|jstor=27640906 |doi=10.1177/0891243206287130 }}</ref> Women are extremely underrepresented in high-paying academic disciplines, like science, business, and law, yet overrepresented in low-paying fields, such as English, romance languages, and education.

On top of receiving incorrect treatment, when seeking treatment for autoimmune disorders which affect more women than men. It takes an average of seeking care from five different doctors and a span of 4 years to receive a diagnosis (Miller). Women's health has come a long way and with help from the FDA and NIH making new policies to include more research gender specific for women, the gap is slowly closing.<ref>Miller, Kenneth. \u201cHow Health Care Fails Women.\u201d Prevention 70, no. 6, June 2018, p46- https://www.prevention.com/health/a22022580/how-health-care-fails-women/.

In the 1970s and 1980s, data showed girls trailing behind boys in a variety of academic performance measures, specifically in test scores in math and science.<ref name=kafir/>\n\nData in the last twenty years shows the general trend of girls outperforming boys in academic achievement in terms of class grades across all subjects and college graduation rates, but boys scoring higher on standardized tests and being better represented in the higher-paying and more prestigious STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and math).<ref name=kafir/>\n\n===Graduation rates===\n\nAccording to recent data (from 2007), 55 percent of college students are females and 45 percent are males.

According to the [[National Center for Transgender Equality]], \"only one-fifth (21%) of transgender people who have transitioned in the National Transgender Discrimination Survey have been able to update all of their IDs and records with their new gender and one-third (33%) had updated none of their IDs or records.

transgender.<ref name=\"iddocs\"/>\n\nSome state appellate courts- including Kansas, Ohio, Texas, Florida, and Illinois- have upheld that the gender an individual is assigned at birth is their legal gender for life, even if the individual has undergone [[sex reassignment surgery|gender reassignment surgery]] or similar treatments, and therefore refuse to acknowledge the gender that transgender

healthcare\"/>\n\nThe [[NCAVP]]'s 2012 Report on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and HIV-affected Hate Violence reported that over fifty percent of anti-LGBTQ homicide victims in 2012 were transgender women, a considerable increase from the percentage of transgender women victims in 2011 at 40%.<ref name=\"NCAVP\"/> In addition, the report also found that, compared to cisgender people, transgender people were more than three times more likely to experience police violence.<ref name=\"NCAVP\"/>\n\nIn terms of mental health, transgender individuals have much higher rates of suicide attempts than cisgender individuals and it has been reported that between nineteen and twenty-five of the trans population have attempted suicide.<ref name=\"Suicide and suicide risk in lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender populations: review and recommendations.\"/>\n\n==Government policy==\nIn 1920, the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which insured women's suffrage (although some individual states allowed women the right to vote as early as 1869), was ratified. In addition, the Women's Bureau of the Department of Labor was created to monitor working conditions for women in the workforce.<ref name=\"Timeline1\"/>\n\nIn 1961, the [[President's Commission on the Status of Women]] was started, initially chaired by [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]. This commission found that women were suffering considerable workplace discrimination. In 1963, the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963|Equal Pay Act]] was passed, which made it illegal for a woman to be paid less than a man working in the same position. The [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] also made discriminatory hiring on the basis of gender illegal. The [[affirmative action]] policy of 1965 was expanded in 1967 to cover women as well as racial minorities. In 1973, women's right to safe and legal abortion was established by the Supreme Court's ruling in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''. In 1968, sex-segregated job advertisements were declared illegal by the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]], this decision was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1973; this allowed women to apply for higher-paying jobs formally restricted only to male applicants. In 1972, [[Title IX]] of the [[Education Amendments of 1972|Education Amendments]], which reads \"No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any educational program or activity receiving federal financial assistance,\" was passed.<ref name=\"timeline2\"/>\n\nIn 1986, in the decision of ''[[Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson]]'', sexual harassment was established as illegal and discriminatory.<ref name =timeline3 /> The [[Family Medical Leave Act]] of 1993 guarantees that new parents can retain their jobs for 12 weeks after the birth of the child; this unpaid leave is the only form of paternal leave protected by law in the United States.<ref name=paternalleave /> In 1994, the [[Violence Against Women Act]] provided legal protection, as well as funds and services, for rape victims and victims of domestic violence. ''[[United States v. Virginia]]'' established in 1996 that gender-based admission practices violated the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], and establishing a separate all-female school would not suffice as an alternative to integrating an all-male school. Most recently, in 2009 the [[Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009]] provides employees (usually female) who suffer from pay discrimination to file a complaint with the government.<ref name=\"timeline3\"/>\n\nThe [[Equal Rights Amendment]], which reads, \"Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex\", was first introduced to Congress in 1923 and successfully passed both houses of Congress in 1972. However, it failed to be ratified by an adequate number of states and died in 1982.<ref name=timeline2 /> The United States is one of only a few countries which have not [[ratified]] the UN [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] (US has only signed the treaty).<ref name=\"UNTC\"/>\n\n==Rankings==\nThe [[World Economic Forum]]'s [[Gender Gap Index]]  for 2012 ranked United States 22nd best out of 135 countries for [[gender equality]].<ref name=\"ggusa\"/><ref name=\"Global Gender Gap Report 2012: The Best And Worst Countries For Women\"/> The primary indicators for inequality were related to political empowerment, where the US was ranked 55th (32nd for women in ministerial position and 78th for women in parliament).<ref name=ggusa/> USA was ranked 33rd for health and survival, 8th for economic participation and opportunity, and tied for 1st (no inequality) in education.<ref name=ggusa/> Since the Gender Gap report was first published in 2006, the US position remains relatively stable in that index.<ref name=ggusa/> However, the United States' score decreased between 2011 and 2012.<ref name=ggusa/><ref name=\"businessinsider\"/>\n\n[[United Nation]]'s [[Gender Inequality Index]] (part of the [[Human Development Report]]) shows that the US scored 19% in gender inequality in 2017 ranking in the13th place out of 173 countries in terms of the Human Development Index.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/indicators/137506|title={{!}} Human Development Reports|website=hdr.undp.org|access-date=September 23, 2019}}</ref> In addition, the [[OECD]]'s Better Life Index discusses a number of differences, but does not stress any in particular when it comes to gender.<ref name=\"Gender and Inequality: How the U.S. Stacks Up Against Other OECD Countries\"/><ref name=\"United States \u2013 OECD Better Life Index\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Affirmative action]]\n* [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]]\n* [[Double burden]]\n* [[Education Amendments of 1972]], [[Title IX]]\n* [[Employment discrimination law in the United States]]\n* [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]]\n* [[Equal Rights Amendment]]\n* [[Gender inequality]] \n* [[Gender role]]\n* [[Lilly Ledbetter]]\n* [[Work-family balance in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"ATTITUDES TOWARD WOMEN'S FAMILIAL ROLES:: Changes in the United States, 1977-1985\">{{cite journal|last1=Mason|first1=K.

It is located in the [[Chicago Loop|Loop]], across [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]] from [[Millennium Park]].  Originally the central library building, it was converted in 1977 to an arts and culture center at the instigation of Commissioner of Cultural Affairs [[Lois Weisberg]]. The city's central library is now housed across the Loop in the spacious, [[Postmodern architecture|postmodern]] [[Harold Washington Library Center]] opened in 1991.\n\nAs the nation's first free municipal cultural center, the Chicago Cultural Center is one of the city's most [[Tourism in Chicago|popular attractions]] and is considered one of the most comprehensive arts showcases in the [[United States]]. Each year, the Chicago Cultural Center features more than 1,000 programs and exhibitions covering a wide range of the performing, visual and literary arts. It also serves as headquarters for the [[Chicago Children's Choir]]. MB Real Estate provides events management for the center.\n\n==Architecture of the Chicago Cultural Center==\nThe building was designed by Boston architectural firm [[Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge]] for the city's central library, and [[Grand Army of the Republic]] (GAR) meeting hall and memorial in 1892.  The land was donated by the GAR and the building was completed in 1897 at a cost of nearly $2 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|2|1897|r=2}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}}). It is organized as a 4-story north wing (77 East Randolph entrance) and a 5-story south wing (78 East Washington entrance), 104 feet tall, with {{convert|3|ft|m|adj=mid|-thick}} masonry walls faced with [[Indiana Limestone|Bedford Blue Limestone]] on a granite base, and designed in a generally [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style with Italian Renaissance elements. It is capped with two stained-glass domes, set symmetrically atop the two wings. Key points of architectural interest are as follows:\n\n* Randolph Street entrance and stairway - Entrance with [[doric column]]s, mahogany doors, and entry hall with [[coffered ceiling]] and walls of green-veined [[Vermont]] marble. The curving stairway is faced with Knoxville pink marble, and features mosaics and ornate bronze balusters.\n* Washington Street entrance, lobby, and grand staircase - Arched portal, bronze-framed doors, and a 3-story, vaulted lobby with walls of white [[Carrara]] marble and mosaics. The staircase is also of white Carrara marble, set with medallions of green marble from [[Connemara]], [[Ireland]], and intricate mosaics of [[Favrile]] glass, stone, and mother of pearl. The stairway to the 5th floor was inspired by [[Venice]]'s [[Bridge of Sighs]].\n* [[Grand Army of the Republic]] Memorial - A large hall and rotunda in the north wing. The hall is faced with deep green [[Vermont]] marble, broken by a series of arches for windows and mahogany doors. The rotunda features 30-foot walls of Knoxville pink marble, mosaic floor, and a fine, stained-glass dome in [[Renaissance]] pattern by the firm of Healy and Millet.\n* Sidney R. Yates Gallery - replica of an assembly hall in the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace]], [[Venice]], with heavily ornamented [[pilaster]]s and coffered ceiling.\n* [[Preston Bradley]] Hall - A large, ornately patterned room of curving white Carrara marble, capped with an austere 38-foot [[Louis Comfort Tiffany|Tiffany]] glass dome designed by artist [[Jacob Adolphus Holzer|J. A. Holzer]]. The Cultural Center states this to be the largest Tiffany dome in the world.\n\n==Past exhibitions==\n''Crossroads: Modernism in Ukraine, 1910-1930'' was a display of art by Ukrainian artists, such as Sukher Ber Rybak, Vsevolod Maskymovych, and Oleksandr Bohomazov to name a few.  ''Crossroads'' was organized by the [[Foundation for International Arts and Education]] with the [[National Art Museum of Ukraine]].  It is presented by the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and the Kyiv Committee of the Chicago Sister Cities International Program.  The exhibition ran from July 22, 2006 - October 15, 2006.\n\n== \"Rush More\" ==\nIn 2017, [[Kerry James Marshall]] was commissioned to produce the inaugural mural entitled \u201cRush More\u201d. Located on the west fa\u00e7ade of the cultural center, the piece was intended to be an homage to women who have contributed to the culture of Chicago.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.peoriapublicradio.org/post/new-chicago-mural-honors-influential-women|title=New Chicago Mural Honors Influential Women|last=Press|first=Associated|website=www.peoriapublicradio.org|language=en|access-date=2019-04-18}}</ref>\n\nPortrayed are:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n* Cheryl Lynn Bruce\n* Jacqueline Russell\n* Maggie Daley\n* Margaret Burroughs\n* Monica Haslip\n* [[Oprah Winfrey]]\n* [[Gwendolyn Brooks]]\n* [[Lois Weisburg]]\n* [[Sandra Delgado]]\n* [[Achy Obejas]]\n* [[Abena Joan Brown]]\n* [[Harriet Monroe]]\n* Jackie Taylor\n* [[Barbara Gaines (director)|Barbara Gaines]]\n* Susanne Ghez\n* [[Joan Gray]]\n* [[Ruth Page (activist)|Ruth Page]]\n* [[Sandra Cisneros]]\n* [[Barbara Jones-Hogu]]\n* Jane Saks<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeout.com/chicago/news/take-a-look-at-kerry-james-marshalls-gigantic-new-mural-at-the-chicago-cultural-center-120417|title=Take a look at Kerry James Marshall\u2019s gigantic new mural at the Chicago Cultural Center|website=Time Out Chicago|language=en|access-date=2019-04-18}}</ref>\n}}\n\nWashington painted the mural on a scale rendering of the building.

Each year, the Chicago Cultural Center features more than 1,000 programs and exhibitions covering a wide range of the performing, visual and literary arts. It also serves as headquarters for the [[Chicago Children's Choir]]. MB Real Estate provides events management for the center. \n\n==Architecture of the Chicago Cultural Center==\nThe building was designed by Boston architectural firm [[Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge]] for the city's central library, and [[Grand Army of the Republic]] (GAR) meeting hall and memorial in 1892.  The land was donated by the GAR and the building was completed in 1897 at a cost of nearly $2 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|2|1897|r=2}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}}). It is organized as a 4-story north wing (77 East Randolph entrance) and a 5-story south wing (78 East Washington entrance), 104 feet tall, with {{convert|3|ft|m|adj=mid|-thick}} masonry walls faced with [[Indiana Limestone|Bedford Blue Limestone]] on a granite base, and designed in a generally [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style with Italian Renaissance elements. It is capped with two stained-glass domes, set symmetrically atop the two wings. Key points of architectural interest are as follows:\n\n* Randolph Street entrance and stairway - Entrance with [[doric column]]s, mahogany doors, and entry hall with [[coffered ceiling]] and walls of green-veined [[Vermont]] marble. The curving stairway is faced with Knoxville pink marble, and features mosaics and ornate bronze balusters.\n* Washington Street entrance, lobby, and grand staircase - Arched portal, bronze-framed doors, and a 3-story, vaulted lobby with walls of white [[Carrara]] marble and mosaics. The staircase is also of white Carrara marble, set with medallions of green marble from [[Connemara]], [[Ireland]], and intricate mosaics of [[Favrile]] glass, stone, and mother of pearl. The stairway to the 5th floor was inspired by [[Venice]]'s [[Bridge of Sighs]].\n* [[Grand Army of the Republic]] Memorial - A large hall and rotunda in the north wing. The hall is faced with deep green [[Vermont]] marble, broken by a series of arches for windows and mahogany doors. The rotunda features 30-foot walls of Knoxville pink marble, mosaic floor, and a fine, stained-glass dome in [[Renaissance]] pattern by the firm of Healy and Millet.\n* Sidney R. Yates Gallery - replica of an assembly hall in the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace]], [[Venice]], with heavily ornamented [[pilaster]]s and coffered ceiling.\n* [[Preston Bradley]] Hall - A large, ornately patterned room of curving white Carrara marble, capped with an austere 38-foot [[Louis Comfort Tiffany|Tiffany]] glass dome designed by artist [[Jacob Adolphus Holzer|J. A. Holzer]]. The Cultural Center states this to be the largest Tiffany dome in the world.\n\n==Past exhibitions==\n''Crossroads: Modernism in Ukraine, 1910-1930'' was a display of art by Ukrainian artists, such as Sukher Ber Rybak, Vsevolod Maskymovych, and Oleksandr Bohomazov to name a few.  ''Crossroads'' was organized by the [[Foundation for International Arts and Education]] with the [[National Art Museum of Ukraine]].  It is presented by the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and the Kyiv Committee of the Chicago Sister Cities International Program.  The exhibition ran from July 22, 2006 - October 15, 2006.\n\n== \"Rush More\" ==\nIn 2017, [[Kerry James Marshall]] was commissioned to produce the inaugural mural entitled \u201cRush More\u201d. Located on the west fa\u00e7ade of the cultural center, the piece was intended to be an homage to women who have contributed to the culture of Chicago.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.peoriapublicradio.org/post/new-chicago-mural-honors-influential-women|title=New Chicago Mural Honors Influential Women|last=Press|first=Associated|website=www.peoriapublicradio.org|language=en|access-date=2019-04-18}}</ref> \n\nPortrayed are:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n* Cheryl Lynn Bruce\n* Jacqueline Russell\n* Maggie Daley\n* Margaret Burroughs\n* Monica Haslip\n* [[Oprah Winfrey]]\n* [[Gwendolyn Brooks]]\n* [[Lois Weisburg]]\n* [[Sandra Delgado]]\n* [[Achy Obejas]]\n* [[Abena Joan Brown]]\n* [[Harriet Monroe]]\n* Jackie Taylor\n* [[Barbara Gaines (director)|Barbara Gaines]]\n* Susanne Ghez\n* [[Joan Gray]]\n* [[Ruth Page (activist)|Ruth Page]]\n* [[Sandra Cisneros]]\n* [[Barbara Jones-Hogu]]\n* Jane Saks<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeout.com/chicago/news/take-a-look-at-kerry-james-marshalls-gigantic-new-mural-at-the-chicago-cultural-center-120417|title=Take a look at Kerry James Marshall\u2019s gigantic new mural at the Chicago Cultural Center|website=Time Out Chicago|language=en|access-date=2019-04-18}}</ref>\n}}\n\nWashington painted the mural on a scale rendering of the building.
