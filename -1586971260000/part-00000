In response to pathogenic tissue damage, ILCs contribute to immunity via the secretion of [[Cytokine|signalling molecules]], and the regulation of both innate and adaptive immune cells.\n\nCharacteristics allowing their differentiation from other immune cells include the absence of regular [[Lymphocyte|lymphoid morphology]], rearranged antigen receptors found on [[T cell receptor|T cells]] and [[B cell receptor|B cells]] (due to the lack of the [[recombination-activating gene| RAG]] gene), and phenotypic markers usually present on [[Myelocyte|myeloid]] or [[dendritic cell]]s. <ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Spits | first1 = Hergen | last2 = Cupedo | first2 = Tom | year = 2012 | title = Innate lymphoid cells: emerging insights in development, lineage relationships, and function | url = | journal = Annual Review of Immunology | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 647\u2013675 | doi=10.1146/annurev-immunol-020711-075053 | pmid=22224763}}</ref>\n\nILCs are primarily tissue resident cells, found in both [[Lymphatic system|lymphoid]] (immune associated), and non- lymphoid tissues, and rarely in the peripheral blood. They are particularly abundant at mucosal surfaces, playing a key role in mucosal immunity and [[homeostasis]].\n\nBased on the difference in developmental pathways, phenotype, and signalling molecules produced, in 2013, ILCs were divided into three groups: 1, 2 and 3, however, after further investigation, we now appreciate five distinct subsets within these groups: [[natural killer cell|NK cells]], ILC1s, ILC2s, ILC3s, and LTi cells.<ref name=\"SpitsArtis2013\">{{cite journal|last1=Spits|first1=Hergen|last2=Artis|first2=David|last3=Colonna|first3=Marco|last4=Diefenbach|first4=Andreas|last5=Di Santo|first5=James P.|last6=Eberl|first6=Gerard|last7=Koyasu|first7=Shigeo|last8=Locksley|first8=Richard M.|last9=McKenzie|first9=Andrew N.

Once matured, the ILCs release cytokines.

Out of 89,000  [[Slovak Jews|Jews]] in the country in 1940, around 69,000 were murdered during the [[Holocaust]].\n\nIn 1938, Slovakia lost significant territory to Hungary according to the [[First Vienna Award]]; the following year, the ruling [[ethnonationalist]] [[Slovak People's Party]] declared independence from [[Second Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] with German protection. Slovak propaganda blamed the Jews for the territorial losses. Jews were targeted for discrimination and harassment, including the [[Aryanization in Slovakia|confiscation of property and businesses]]. The exclusion of Jews from the economy impoverished the community, which encouraged the government to conscript them for forced labor. \n\nIn 1941, the Slovak government negotiated with Nazi Germany for the mass deportation of Jews to [[German-occupied Poland]]. Between March and October 1942, [[List of Holocaust transports from Slovakia|58,000 Jews were deported]] to [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] and the [[Lublin District]] of the [[General Governorate]] in German-occupied Poland; only a few hundred survived. The Slovak government organized the transports and paid 500 [[Reichsmarks]] per Jew for the supposed cost of resettlement. The persecution of Jews resumed in August 1944, when [[German occupation of Slovakia|Germany invaded Slovakia]] and triggered the [[Slovak National Uprising]]. Another 13,500 Jews were deported and hundreds to thousands were murdered in Slovakia by [[Einsatzgruppe H]] and the [[Hlinka Guard Emergency Divisions]].\n\nSurvivors faced [[secondary antisemitism|renewed antisemitism]] and difficulty regaining stolen property; most emigrated. The [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|postwar Communist regime]] banned discussion of the Holocaust, the ban was only removed after the [[Velvet Revolution|fall of the Communist regime]] in 1989. The Slovak government's complicity in the Holocaust remains a contentious issue in the country.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Background ==\n{{further|History of the Jews in Slovakia}}\n\n[[File:Synagogue Zilina 1931.jpg|thumb|left|The [[New Synagogue (\u017dilina)|New Synagogue]] in [[\u017dilina]] shortly after completion, {{circa|1931}}]]\nBefore 1939, Slovakia had never been an independent country.

propaganda poster exhorts readers not to \"be a servant to the Jew\".|upright=1.2]]\n{{The Holocaust sidebar}}\n'''The Holocaust in Slovakia''' was the systematic dispossession, deportation, and murder of Jews in the [[Slovak State]], a [[client state]] of [[Nazi Germany]]. Out of 89,000  [[Slovak Jews|Jews]] in the country in 1940, around 69,000 were murdered during the [[Holocaust]].\n\nIn 1938, Slovakia lost significant territory to Hungary according to the [[First Vienna Award]]; the following year, the ruling [[ethnonationalist]] [[Slovak People's Party]] declared independence from [[Second Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] with German protection. Slovak propaganda blamed the Jews for the territorial losses. Jews were targeted for discrimination and harassment, including the [[Aryanization in Slovakia|confiscation of property and businesses]]. The exclusion of Jews from the economy impoverished the community, which encouraged the government to conscript them for forced labor. \n\nIn 1941, the Slovak government negotiated with Nazi Germany for the mass deportation of Jews to [[German-occupied Poland]]. Between March and October 1942, [[List of Holocaust transports from Slovakia|58,000 Jews were deported]] to [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] and the [[Lublin District]] of the [[General Governorate]] in German-occupied Poland; only a few hundred survived. The Slovak government organized the transports and paid 500 [[Reichsmarks]] per Jew for the supposed cost of resettlement. The persecution of Jews resumed in August 1944, when [[German occupation of Slovakia|Germany invaded Slovakia]] and triggered the [[Slovak National Uprising]]. Another 13,500 Jews were deported and hundreds to thousands were murdered in Slovakia by [[Einsatzgruppe H]] and the [[Hlinka Guard Emergency Divisions]].\n\nSurvivors faced [[secondary antisemitism|renewed antisemitism]] and difficulty regaining stolen property; most emigrated. The [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|postwar Communist regime]] banned discussion of the Holocaust, the ban was only removed after the [[Velvet Revolution|fall of the Communist regime]] in 1989.

But the [[woodcock]] refuses to attend, on the grounds that Solomon is inferior to the [[Queen of Sheba]] to King [[Solomon]]. Solomon sends for the Queen, and houses her in a room made of glass, through which he reveals that she has a hairy foot. She demands from him the answer to three riddles before she will pay homage:<ref name=\"Lassner1993\">Jacob Lassner, ''Demonizing the Queen of Sheba: Boundaries of Gender and Culture in Postbiblical Judaism and Medieval Islam''. University of Chicago Press, 1993, pp.14-17</ref>\n* A cistern of wood; buckets of water; they draw up stones; they cause water to flow. \u2014 A tube of cosmetic eye-paint.\n* What is the thing which comes as dust from the earth, easts dust, is poured out as water, and sticks to the house? \u2014 [[Naphtha]].\n* What is that which acts as an oracle (or as a storm), goes at the head of all, cries loudly and bitterly with its head bowed down like a rush, is a cause of praise to the free, of shame to the poor, of honour to the dead, of disgrace to the living, of joy to the birds, and of grief to the fish? \u2014 [[Flax]].\nSolomon solves the riddles, and the two exchange gifts. The riddles are noteworthy examples of [[Hebrew Riddles]].<ref>Christine Goldberg, ''Turandot's Sisters: A Study of the Folktale AT 851'', Garland Folklore Library, 7 (New York: Garland, 1993), pp. 22-23.</ref>\n\n== Date ==\nThere is controversy among scholars about the date of the Targum Sheni. Various 19th-century scholars dated it to the 4th century (S. Gelbhaus), 6th century (P. Cassel), or 11th century (L. Munk).<ref name=\"ej\">Encyclopaedia Judaica, [https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/targum-sheni Targum Sheni]</ref> The ''Encyclopaedia Judaica'' argued for a dating of the late 7th or early 8th century.<ref name=\"ej\"/> Linguistic features of the (Galilean) Aramaic text, including its many Greek loan words, are one of the stronger arguments in support of an earlier dating. More recently Allegra Iafrate (2015) argued for a date in the 10th century due to the fact that Targum Sheni shows dependency on and shares striking similarities with [[De Ceremoniis]], a work which itself was composed in the middle of the 10th century in the [[Byzantine Empire]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Iafrate|first=Allegra|title=The Wandering Throne of Solomon: Objects and Tales of Kingship in the Medieval Mediterranean (Mediterranean Art Histories: Studies in Visual Cultures, Late Antiquity to the Modern Period, Band 2)|publisher=Brill|year=2015|isbn=9004305181|location=|pages=147-151}}</ref>\n\nThere are a number of notable parallels between the ''Targum Sheni'' account and the [[Qur'an]]ic account of Solomon and the Queen in [[Sura]] 27 (and also some notable differences), and much of the controversy centers on whether these similarities support an earlier or later dating, that is, which composition exerted influence on the other. The ascribed date of 800 by the ''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]'' is post-Islamic so the ''Targum Sheni'' may have been influenced by the Qur'an. However, some scholars believe that the Qur'anic account islamicises pre-existing Jewish and [[folklore|folkloric]] traditions, perhaps including sixth-century Christian input, which were closer to those presented in the ''Targum Sheni''.<ref>cf Lassner, p. 227 n.2 and pp. 132 et seq</ref>\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==See also==\n*[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14248-targum#anchor12 Apocryphal Additions to Esther - Jewish Encyclopedia]\n*[https://archive.org/details/explanatorycomme00cassrich An explanatory commentary on Esther] tr. of Cassel, Paulus, Edinburgh 1888.

She demands from him the answer to three riddles before she will pay homage:<ref name=\"Lassner1993\">Jacob Lassner, ''Demonizing the Queen of Sheba: Boundaries of Gender and Culture in Postbiblical Judaism and Medieval Islam''. University of Chicago Press, 1993, pp.14-17</ref>\n* A cistern of wood; buckets of water; they draw up stones; they cause water to flow. \u2014 A tube of cosmetic eye-paint.\n* What is the thing which comes as dust from the earth, easts dust, is poured out as water, and sticks to the house? \u2014 [[Naphtha]].\n* What is that which acts as an oracle (or as a storm), goes at the head of all, cries loudly and bitterly with its head bowed down like a rush, is a cause of praise to the free, of shame to the poor, of honour to the dead, of disgrace to the living, of joy to the birds, and of grief to the fish? \u2014 [[Flax]].\nSolomon solves the riddles, and the two exchange gifts. The riddles are noteworthy examples of [[Hebrew Riddles]].<ref>Christine Goldberg, ''Turandot's Sisters: A Study of the Folktale AT 851'', Garland Folklore Library, 7 (New York: Garland, 1993), pp. 22-23.</ref>\n\n== Date ==\nThere is controversy among scholars about the date of the Targum Sheni. Various 19th-century scholars dated it to the 4th century (S. Gelbhaus), 6th century (P. Cassel), or 11th century (L. Munk).<ref name=\"ej\">Encyclopaedia Judaica, [https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/targum-sheni Targum Sheni]</ref> The ''Encyclopaedia Judaica'' argued for a dating of the late 7th or early 8th century.<ref name=\"ej\"/> Linguistic features of the (Galilean) Aramaic text, including its many Greek loan words, are one of the stronger arguments in support of an earlier dating. More recently Allegra Iafrate (2015) argued for a date in the 10th century due to the fact that the Targum Sheni shows dependency on and shares striking similarities with [[De Ceremoniis]], a work which itself was composed in the middle of the 10th century in the [[Byzantine Empire]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Iafrate|first=Allegra|title=The Wandering Throne of Solomon: Objects and Tales of Kingship in the Medieval Mediterranean (Mediterranean Art Histories: Studies in Visual Cultures, Late Antiquity to the Modern Period, Band 2)|publisher=Brill|year=2015|isbn=9004305181|location=|pages=147-151}}</ref>\n\nThere are a number of notable parallels between the ''Targum Sheni'' account and the [[Qur'an]]ic account of Solomon and the Queen in [[Sura]] 27 (and also some notable differences), and much of the controversy centers on whether these similarities support an earlier or later dating, that is, which composition exerted influence on the other. The ascribed date of 800 by the ''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]'' is post-Islamic so the ''Targum Sheni'' may have been influenced by the Qur'an. However, some scholars believe that the Qur'anic account islamicises pre-existing Jewish and [[folklore|folkloric]] traditions, perhaps including sixth-century Christian input, which were closer to those presented in the ''Targum Sheni''.<ref>cf Lassner, p. 227 n.2 and pp. 132 et seq</ref>\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==See also==\n*[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14248-targum#anchor12 Apocryphal Additions to Esther - Jewish Encyclopedia]\n*[https://archive.org/details/explanatorycomme00cassrich An explanatory commentary on Esther] tr. of Cassel, Paulus, Edinburgh 1888.

The owner of the Texas firm, Cherno Nije, was arrested at [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] and charged with violating the [[Neutrality Act of 1794]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/21/how-former-us-army-officer-launched-disastrous-coup-the-gambia|title = The reckless plot to overthrow Africa's most absurd dictator|last = Rice|first = Andrew|date = 21 July 2015|work = The Guardian|access-date = 21 July 2015|via = }}</ref> During the raid on Nije's home in Texas, the FBI found a manifesto entitled \u201cGambia Reborn: A Charter for Transition from Dictatorship to Democracy and Development,\u201d as well as a spreadsheet detailing the coup attempt's $221,000 budget funded by Nije, who was a millionaire.<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.buzzfeed.com/hayesbrown/meet-the-man-who-wanted-to-rule-the-gambia|title = Meet the Man Who Wanted to Rule the Gambia|last = Brown|first = Hayes|date = 6 January 2015|work = BuzzFeed|access-date = 21 July 2015|via = }}</ref> Faal was also charged and later pleaded guilty.<ref>{{Cite press release|title = Two Defendants Charged For Their Role In An Attempted Coup In The Gambia|date = 5 January 2015|publisher = U.S. Attorney's Office - District of Minnesota|url = http://www.justice.gov/usao-mn/pr/two-defendants-charged-their-role-attempted-coup-gambia|access-date = 21 July 2015}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/how-a-reviled-african-ruler-survived-a-coup-hatched-in-the-united-states/2015/05/31/a9fc1772-0485-11e5-8bda-c7b4e9a8f7ac_story.html|title = How a reviled African ruler survived a coup hatched in the United States|last = Whitlock|first = Craig|date = 31 May 2015|work = The Washington Post|access-date = 21 July 2015|via = |last2 = Goldman|first2 = Adam}}</ref> Two others, Alagie Barrow of Tennessee and Banka Manneh of Georgia, were also charged.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.voanews.com/content/us-man-pleads-guilty-in-gambia-coup-plot/2621051.html|title = Third American Citizen Charged in Gambia Coup Plot|last = |first = |date = 30 January 2015|work = Voice of America|access-date = 21 July 2015|via = }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.foroyaa.gm/archives/4373|title = Banka Manneh Charged In the US In Relation To State House Attack|last = Nyang|first = Modou|date = 23 March 2015|work = Foroyaa Newspaper|access-date = 21 July 2015|via = }}</ref> Both later pleaded guilty as well.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.foroyaa.gm/archives/5010|title = In U.S. Trial: Banka Manneh, Alagie Barrow to Plead Guilty|last = Nyang|first = Modou|date = 4 May 2015|work = Foroyaa Newspaper|access-date = 21 July 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150713065116/http://www.foroyaa.gm/archives/5010|archive-date = 13 July 2015|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Washington Post]]'' later revealed that the FBI had interviewed Sanneh at his home in Maryland and thereafter tipped off Senegalese officials about the plot through the [[United States Department of State|State Department]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIt was reported on 2 April 2017 that corpses of three alleged conspirators, Lamin Sanneh, Alagie Nyass and Njaga Jagne were discovered by the Gambian police, after the fall of the Jammeh regime.<ref>{{Cite news|url =http://www.africanews.com/2017/04/02/gambia-bodies-of-three-accused-coup-conspirators-in-2014-discovered/|title = Bodies of three accused coup conspirators in 2014 discovered|last =|first =|date = 2 April 2017|work = africanews.com|access-date = 13 April 2017|via = }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[1994 Gambian coup d'\u00e9tat]]\n*[[Dawda Jawara]]\n* [[History of the Gambia]]\n* [[LGBT rights in the Gambia]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Years in the Gambia}}\n{{African coups d'\u00c9tat}}\n{{Coup d'\u00e9tat}}\n{{Military History of The Gambia}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:2014 Gambian coup d'etat attempt}}\n[[Category:2010s coups d'\u00e9tat and coup attempts|Gambia]]\n[[Category:Attempted coups]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 2014]]\n[[Category:Politics of the Gambia]]\n[[Category:2014 in the Gambia]]\n[[Category:December 2014 events in Africa]]\n", "name_user": "Alaney2k", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEvents:the work's name is \"The New York Times\"", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gambian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat_attempt"}

All recipients of new or replacement British passports issued in Bermuda, prior to 2002, received this passport, whether they possessed Bermudian status or not. The citizenship of the holder was indicated by rubber stamp in the appropriate field inside the passport. Prior to 1983, the citizenship for British citizens from the United Kingdom or the colonies was ''Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies''. After 1983, when citizens in the United Kingdom became ''British Citizens'', colonials became ''British Dependent Territories Citizens'' (as this was purely to enable the British Governments immigration authorities to distinguish and discriminate against colonials, this type of British Citizenship did not entitle the holder to right of abode in any British Dependent Territory, including Bermuda. Bermudian status was indicated by the addition of ''(Bermuda)'' after ''British Dependent Territories Citizen'' on the rubber stamp), losing the right of abode in the United Kingdom unless already settled in the United Kingdom or having been born in, or having a parent who had been born in, the United Kingdom. Prior to 2002, it was not legal for a person to hold two British passports. A person who possessed both Bermudian status and right of abode (or ''settled'' status) in the United kingdom could have both indicated in the same passport. A ''British citizen'' who did not possess Bermudian status would receive the supposedly ''Bermudian passport'' if obtaining it in Bermuda, with the citizenship stamped as \"British Citizen\" only (unless the holder also possessed status in another territory or held yet another type of British Citizenship). Those who held neither Bermudian status nor the right of abode in the United Kingdom, but who were entitled to a British Passport would also receive the \"Bermudian\" Passport in Bermuda, with the appropriate citizenship stamped inside. Before 1983, a Bermudian ''Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies'', and, after 1983, a ''British Dependent Territories Citizen'' with Bermudian status who did not possess the right of abode in the United Kingdom, who obtained a British Passport in the United Kingdom, or at a United Kingdom Consulate in a foreign country, received a normal British Passport (not the ''Bermudian'' passport) with the appropriate citizenship rubber stamped inside.\n\nIn 1988, when the blue British Passports were replaced with a burgundy one of a common European Union pattern, the passports issued in the British Dependent Territories were changed accordingly (entitlement to free movement in the European Movement was indicated only on the passports on the United Kingdom type passports, with ''EUROPEAN UNION'' added above ''UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND'' on the outside of the front cover (where the ''Bermudian'' passport reads only ''BRITISH PASSPORT'').\n\nIn 2002, ''British Overseas Territories Citizenship'' was re-named ''British Overseas Territories Citizenship'', remaining as the default citizenship for British citizens born in what were at the same time re-designated the ''British Overseas Territories'', and the barriers that had been put in place in 1983 to end free movement of most colonials (excepting Falkland Islanders and later Gibraltarians) into the United Kingdom were removed. British Overseas Territories Citizens were also entitled to obtain ''British Citizenship'' by obtaining a normal British Passport with the citizenship stamped as ''British Citizen''. The restriction against holding more than one British passport was removed. The Department of Immigration was no longer permitted to issue new or replacement passports except for British Overseas Citizenship holders. The citizenship for these was entered only as ''British Overseas Territories Citizen''. Bermudian status was stamped in separately on one of the internal pages. Without the stamp indicating that the passport holder is registered as a Bermudian, a ''Bermudian'' Passport with the citizenship entered as ''British Overseas Territories Citizen'' is not sufficient to identify the holder as a Bermudian. The endorsement indicating the holder has Bermudian status can be stamped into any British Passport, with the citizenship entered as either 'British Overseas Territories Citizen'' or 'British Citizen''. As the ''Bermudian'' passport still lacked ''EUROPEAN UNION'' on the front cover, and used the country code ''BMU'' indicated inside instead of the ''GBR'' indicated in the British Citizen/United Kingdom passport, it is not necessarily accepted in other European Union countries as entitling the holder to free movement within the European Union. As a consequence, the only practical reason a Bermudian would obtain the ''Bermudian'' passport, whether in addition or in preference to the normal British passport with Bermudian status stamped inside, was for the purpose of entering the United States of America, which has lower entry restrictions on Bermudians than on other British nationals, but specifies they must present a British Passport with ''Government of Bermuda'' on the front, citizenship entered as either ''British Dependent Territories Citizen'' or ''British Overseas Territories Citizen'', and the endorsement stamped to show the holder has been registered as a Bermudian.\n\nSince the HM Passport Office in the UK became the sole issuer of all British passports in 2016, only the normal (UK-type) British Passport is issued, whatever the type of British Citizenship entered. Bermuda Immigration enters the Bermudian status stamp separately (passports applied for in Bermuda can be obtained by handing the application to the Department of Immigration in Bermuda, which forwards the it to HM Passport office and receives it back on behalf of the applicant).\n\n==Application==\n\nAdult applicants can apply for a standard Bermudian [[ePassport]] at a cost of US$160.

Lyonne explained to ''[[The New York Times]]'' that in choosing the song she was struck by the \"buoyant doomsday quality\" of Nilsson's life. Other contenders for the reset song included \"[[Not Tonight]]\" by [[Lil' Kim]], \"Crazy Feeling\" by [[Lou Reed]] and \"[[No Fun (song)|No Fun]]\" by [[The Stooges]]. Though Netflix finally obtained the usage rights to Nilsson's song, the cost of using it so many times took up a significant portion of the music budget. His estate also limited how many times the song could be used.

(see also [[International standard business attire]]) \n\nIn western countries these policies vary depending on the industry with [[lawyers]], [[bankers]], and [[Executive (management)|executives]] often wearing suit and tie. Some businesses observe that anti-discrimination laws restricts their determining what is appropriate and inappropriate workplace clothing. Requiring men and women to dress differently at the workplace can be challenged because the gender-specific dress codes would be based on one sex and could be considered stereotypical.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/tools-and-samples/toolkits/pages/employeedressandappearance.aspx|website=Society for Human Resource Management|accessdate=27 September 2017|title = Employee Dress and Appearance}}{{subscription required}}</ref> Most businesses have authority in determining and establishing what workplace clothes they can require of their workers.

Many [[information technology]] businesses in [[Silicon Valley]] were early adopters of this dress code. In contrast to formal business wear such as [[suit (clothing)|suit]]s and [[necktie]]s (the [[international standard business attire]]), the business casual dress code has no generally accepted definition; its interpretation differs widely among organizations and is often a cause of sartorial confusion among workers.\n\nThe [[job search engine]] [[Monster.com]] offers this definition, \"In general, business casual means dressing professionally, looking relaxed, yet neat and pulled together.\" A more pragmatic definition is that business casual dress is the mid ground between formal business clothes and street clothes. Generally, neckties are excluded from business casual dress, unless worn in nontraditional ways. The acceptability of blue [[jeans]] and denim cloth clothing varies \u2014 some businesses consider them to be sloppy and informal.\n\n==Education system ==\n{{Overly detailed|section|date=September 2019}}\nMany schools around the world implement dress codes in the school system to prevent students from wearing inappropriate clothing items to school and was thought to help influence a safer and more professional environment. \n\n=== United States education ===\nIn 1996, former U. S. President [[Bill Clinton]] announced his support for the idea of [[school uniform]]s by stating, \u201cSchool uniforms are one step that may help break the cycle of violence, truancy and disorder by helping young students understand what really counts is what kind of people they are.\u201d Many [[school district]]s in the United States took up the idea.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bowen|first=Sherry|title=Should Kids Wear School Uniforms?|url=http://www.eduguide.org/article/should-kids-wear-school-uniforms|publisher=EduGuide|accessdate=September 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\nEven though dress code was created to positively affect schools, a common held belief in the U.S. is that the rules actually impede on students' right to self-expression. There have been many court cases regarding school dress code, the first being the [[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District]]. The case was held because students wore black [[armband]]s to protest the Vietnam war.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://education.findlaw.com/student-rights/school-dress-codes.html|title=School Dress Codes - FindLaw|work=Findlaw|access-date=2017-12-08}}</ref>\n\n====Dress code violations====\nNon-communicative dress code violations in public schools are violations that are without implications of hate, gang-affiliation, etc.<ref name=\"Herbon, Beth 2000\">Herbon, Beth, and Jane E.

Some businesses observe that anti-discrimination laws restricts their determining what is appropriate and inappropriate workplace clothing. Requiring men and women to dress differently at the workplace can be challenged because the gender-specific dress codes would be based on one sex and could be considered stereotypical.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/tools-and-samples/toolkits/pages/employeedressandappearance.aspx|website=Society for Human Resource Management|accessdate=27 September 2017|title = Employee Dress and Appearance}}{{subscription required}}</ref> Most businesses have authority in determining and establishing what workplace clothes they can require of their workers. Generally, a carefully drafted dress code applied consistently does not violate anti-discrimination laws.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.ppspublishers.com/biz/dresscode.htm |title = Dress Code Legal Issues|website =  Personnel Policy Services Inc|last = Thomas|first = Robin|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160314064207/http://www.ppspublishers.com/biz/dresscode.htm|archivedate = 14 March 2016}}</ref> So long as the dress code does not favor one gender over the other it is usually acceptable by law for employers to have a private dress code.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.employmentlawfirms.com/resources/employment/discrimination/illegal-workplace-policy.htm|title=Illegal Workplace Policies: Appearance, Dress Codes, and Grooming Policies|website=www.employmentlawfirms.com|language=en|access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref>\n\n=== Formal wear ===\nIn western countries a \"formal\" or [[white tie]] dress code typically means tailcoats for men and full-length evening dresses for women. \"Semi-formal\" has a much less precise definition but typically means an evening jacket and tie for men (known as [[black tie]]) and a dress for women. \"Business casual\" typically means not wearing [[Necktie|neckties]] or [[Suit (clothing)|suits]], but wearing instead collared shirts, and trousers (not black, but more ''relaxed'', including things such as [[corduroy]]). \"Casual\" typically just means clothing for the torso, legs and shoes. \"Wedding Casual\" defines yet another mode of dress, where guests dress respectfully, but not necessarily fancily.\n\n=== Business casual ===\n{{Main|Business casual}}''Business casual'' dress is a popular workplace dress code that emerged in [[white-collar worker|white-collar]] workplaces in [[Western world|Western countries]] in the 1990s, especially in the United States and Canada. Many [[information technology]] businesses in [[Silicon Valley]] were early adopters of this dress code. In contrast to formal business wear such as [[suit (clothing)|suit]]s and [[necktie]]s (the [[international standard business attire]]), the business casual dress code has no generally accepted definition; its interpretation differs widely among organizations and is often a cause of sartorial confusion among workers.\n\nThe [[job search engine]] [[Monster.com]] offers this definition, \"In general, business casual means dressing professionally, looking relaxed, yet neat and pulled together.\" A more pragmatic definition is that business casual dress is the mid ground between formal business clothes and street clothes. Generally, neckties are excluded from business casual dress, unless worn in nontraditional ways. The acceptability of blue [[jeans]] and denim cloth clothing varies \u2014 some businesses consider them to be sloppy and informal.\n\n==Education system ==\n{{Overly detailed|section|date=September 2019}}\nMany schools around the world implement dress codes in the school system to prevent students from wearing inappropriate clothing items to school and was thought to help influence a safer and more professional environment. \n\n=== United States education ===\nIn 1996, former U. S. President [[Bill Clinton]] announced his support for the idea of [[school uniform]]s by stating, \u201cSchool uniforms are one step that may help break the cycle of violence, truancy and disorder by helping young students understand what really counts is what kind of people they are.\u201d Many [[school district]]s in the United States took up the idea.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bowen|first=Sherry|title=Should Kids Wear School Uniforms?|url=http://www.eduguide.org/article/should-kids-wear-school-uniforms|publisher=EduGuide|accessdate=September 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\nEven though dress code was created to positively affect schools, a common held belief in the U.S. is that the rules actually impede on students' right to self-expression. There have been many court cases regarding school dress code, the first being the [[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District]]. The case was held because students wore black [[armband]]s to protest the Vietnam war.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://education.findlaw.com/student-rights/school-dress-codes.html|title=School Dress Codes - FindLaw|work=Findlaw|access-date=2017-12-08}}</ref>\n\n====Dress code violations====\nNon-communicative dress code violations in public schools are violations that are without implications of hate, gang-affiliation, etc.<ref name=\"Herbon, Beth 2000\">Herbon, Beth, and Jane E.
