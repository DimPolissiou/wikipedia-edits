He served as leader of [[Reform Judaism]] in his native country and internationally, and later [[Reichsvertretung der Deutschen Juden|represented all German Jews]] during the Nazi era. After the [[Second World War]], he settled in [[London]], UK, where he served as the chairman of the [[World Union for Progressive Judaism]].\n[[File:Bust of Leo Baeck.jpg|thumb|Bust of Leo Baeck at the [[Wiener Library for the Study of the Holocaust and Genocide]] in London, UK]]\n\n== Early years ==\nBaeck was born in [[Leszno|Lissa]] (Leszno) (then in the German [[Province of Posen]], now in Poland), the son of Rabbi [[Samuel Baeck]], and began his education at the  [[Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau]] in 1894. He also studied [[philosophy]] in Berlin with [[Wilhelm Dilthey]], served as a rabbi in [[Opole|Oppeln]], [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], and Berlin, and taught at the [[Hochschule f\u00fcr die Wissenschaft des Judentums]] (Higher Institute for Jewish Studies). In 1905 Baeck published ''The Essence of Judaism'', in response to [[Adolf von Harnack]]'s ''What is Christianity?''. This book, which interpreted and valorized Judaism through a prism of [[neo-Kantianism]] tempered with religious existentialism, made him a famous proponent for the Jewish people and their faith. During [[World War I]], Baeck was a  [[chaplain]] in the [[German Imperial Army]].\n\n== Nazi persecution and deportation ==\nIn 1933, after the [[Nazis]] took power, Baeck worked to defend the Jewish community as president of the [[Reichsvertretung der Deutschen Juden]], an [[umbrella organization]] that united [[German Jewry]] from 1933 to 1938. After the Reichsvertretung was disbanded during [[Kristallnacht|the November Pogrom]], the Nazis reassembled the council's members under the government controlled [[Reichsvereinigung der Juden in Deutschland|Reichsvereinigung]].  Leo Baeck headed this organization as its president until his deportation. On 27 January 1943, he was deported to the [[Concentration camp Theresienstadt|Theresienstadt concentration camp]].\n\nLeo Baeck became the \"honorary head\" of the Council of Elders ([[Judenrat]]) in Theresienstadt.

{"title_page": "Computational electromagnetics", "text_new": "{{Use American English|date = April 2019}}\n{{Short description|branch of physics}}\n'''Computational electromagnetics''' ('''CEM'''), '''computational electrodynamics''' or '''electromagnetic modeling''' is the process of modeling the interaction of [[electromagnetic field]]s with physical objects and the environment.\n\nIt typically involves using computationally efficient approximations to [[Maxwell's equations]] and is used to calculate [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] performance, [[electromagnetic compatibility]], [[radar cross section]] and electromagnetic [[wave propagation]] when not in free space.\n\nA specific part of computational electromagnetics deals with [[electromagnetic radiation]] [[light scattering by particles|scattered and absorbed by small particles]].\n\n==Background==\n<!-- ''Why do electromagnetic modeling?   is being modeled?  What are the computational issues?''  {{Expand section|date=October 2008}} -->\nSeveral real-world electromagnetic problems like [[electromagnetic scattering]], [[electromagnetic radiation]], modeling of [[waveguide]]s etc., are not analytically calculable, for the multitude of irregular geometries found in actual devices. Computational numerical techniques can overcome the inability to derive closed form solutions of Maxwell's equations under various [[constitutive relation]]s of media, and [[boundary condition]]s. This makes ''computational electromagnetics'' (CEM) important to the design, and modeling of antenna, radar, [[communication satellite|satellite]] and other communication systems, [[nanophotonic]] devices and high speed [[silicon]] electronics, [[medical imaging]], cell-phone antenna design, among other applications.\n\nCEM typically solves the problem of computing the ''E'' (electric) and ''H'' (magnetic) fields across the problem domain (e.g., to calculate antenna [[radiation pattern]] for an arbitrarily shaped antenna structure). Also calculating power flow direction ([[Poynting vector]]), a waveguide's [[normal mode]]s, media-generated wave dispersion, and scattering can be computed from the ''E'' and ''H'' fields. CEM models may or may not assume [[symmetry]], simplifying real world structures to idealized [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]s, [[sphere]]s, and other regular geometrical objects. CEM models extensively make use of symmetry, and solve for reduced dimensionality from 3 spatial dimensions to 2D and even 1D.\n\nAn [[Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace|eigenvalue]] problem formulation of CEM allows us to calculate steady state normal modes in a structure. [[Transient response]] and impulse field effects are more accurately modeled by CEM in time domain, by [[FDTD]]. Curved geometrical objects are treated more accurately as finite elements [[Finite element method|FEM]], or non-orthogonal grids. [[Beam propagation method]] (BPM) can solve for the power flow in waveguides. CEM is application specific, even if different techniques converge to the same field and power distributions in the modeled domain.\n\n==Overview of methods==\nOne approach is to discretize the space in terms of grids (both orthogonal, and non-orthogonal) and solving Maxwell's equations at each point in the grid. Discretization consumes computer memory, and solving the equations takes significant time. Large-scale CEM problems face memory and CPU limitations. As of 2007, CEM problems require supercomputers,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} high performance clusters,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} vector processors and/or [[parallel computer|parallelism]]. Typical formulations involve either time-stepping through the equations over the whole domain for each time instant; or through banded [[matrix inversion]] to calculate the weights of basis functions, when modeled by finite element methods; or matrix products when using transfer matrix methods; or calculating [[integral]]s when using [[Boundary element method|method of moments]] (MoM); or using [[fast fourier transform]]s, and time iterations when calculating by the split-step method or by BPM.\n\n==Choice of methods==\nChoosing the right technique for solving a problem is important, as choosing the wrong one can either result in incorrect results, or results which take excessively long to compute. However, the name of a technique does not always tell one how it is implemented, especially for commercial tools, which will often have more than one solver.\n\nDavidson<ref name=\"davidson\" /> gives two tables comparing the FEM, MoM and FDTD techniques in the way they are normally implemented. One table is for both open region (radiation and scattering problems) and another table is for guided wave problems.\n\n==Maxwell's equations in hyperbolic PDE form==\nMaxwell's equations can be formulated as a [[hyperbolic system]] of [[partial differential equation]]s.  This gives access to powerful techniques for numerical solutions.\n\nIt is assumed that the waves propagate in the (''x'',''y'')-plane and restrict the direction of the magnetic field to be parallel to the ''z''-axis and thus the electric field to be parallel to the (''x'',''y'') plane. The wave is called a transverse magnetic (TM) wave.  In 2D and no polarization terms present, Maxwell's equations can then be formulated as:\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\bar{u} + A\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\bar{u} + B\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\bar{u} +C\\bar{u} = \\bar{g}</math>\n\nwhere ''u'', ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' are defined as\n\n:<math>\\bar{u}=\\left(\\begin{matrix} E_x \\\\ E_y \\\\ H_z \\end{matrix}\\right),</math>\n\n:<math>A=\\left(\\begin{matrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{\\mu} & 0 \\end{matrix}\\right),</math>\n\n:<math>B=\\left(\\begin{matrix} 0 & 0 & \\frac{-1}{\\epsilon} \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\frac{-1}{\\mu} & 0 & 0 \\end{matrix}\\right),</math>\n\n:<math>C=\\left(\\begin{matrix} \\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{matrix}\\right).</math>\n\nIn this representation, <math>\\bar{g}</math> is the [[forcing function (differential equations)|forcing function]], and is in the same space as <math>\\bar{u}</math>.  It can be used to express an externally applied field or to describe an optimization [[constraint (mathematics)|constraint]].  As formulated above:\n:<math>\\bar{g}=\\left(\\begin{matrix} E_{x, constraint} \\\\ E_{y, constraint} \\\\ H_{z, constraint} \\end{matrix}\\right).</math>\n\n<math>\\bar{g}</math> may also be explicitly defined equal to zero to simplify certain problems, or to find a [[Generalized eigenvector|characteristic solution]], which is often the first step in a method to find the particular inhomogeneous solution.\n\n==Integral equation solvers==\n\n===The discrete dipole approximation===\nThe [[discrete dipole approximation]] is a flexible technique for computing scattering and absorption by targets of arbitrary [[geometry]]. The formulation is based on integral form of Maxwell equations. The DDA is an approximation of the continuum target by a finite array of polarizable points. The points acquire [[Magnetic moment|dipole moment]]s in response to the local electric field. The dipoles of course interact with one another via their electric fields, so the DDA is also sometimes referred to as the coupled [[dipole]] approximation. The resulting linear system of equations is commonly solved using [[conjugate gradient]] iterations. The discretization matrix has symmetries (the integral form of Maxwell equations has form of convolution) enabling [[Fast Fourier Transform]] to multiply matrix times vector during conjugate gradient iterations.\n\n===Method of moments element method ===\nThe method of moments (MoM)<ref>Roger F. Harrington (1968). Field Computation by Moment Methods. Latest printing by IEEE Press in 1993, {{ISBN|0780310144}}.</ref> or [[boundary element method]] (BEM) is a numerical computational method of solving linear partial differential equations which have been formulated as [[integral equation]]s (i.e. in ''boundary integral'' form). It can be applied in many areas of engineering and science including [[fluid mechanics]], [[acoustics]], [[electromagnetics]], [[fracture mechanics]], and [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]].\n\nMoM has become more popular since the 1980s. Because it requires calculating only boundary values, rather than values throughout the space, it is significantly more efficient in terms of computational resources for problems with a small surface/volume ratio. Conceptually, it works by constructing a \"mesh\" over the modeled surface.  However, for many problems, BEM are significantly computationally less efficient than volume-discretization methods ([[finite element method]], [[finite difference method]], [[finite volume method]]).  Boundary element formulations typically give rise to fully populated matrices. This means that the storage requirements and computational time will tend to grow according to the square of the problem size.  By contrast, finite element matrices are typically banded (elements are only locally connected) and the storage requirements for the system matrices typically grow linearly with the problem size.  Compression techniques (''e.g.'' multipole expansions or adaptive cross approximation/hierarchical matrices) can be used to ameliorate these problems, though at the cost of added complexity and with a success-rate that depends heavily on the nature and geometry of the problem.\n\nBEM is applicable to problems for which [[Green's function]]s can be calculated.  These usually involve fields in [[linear]] [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]] media.  This places considerable restrictions on the range and generality of problems suitable for boundary elements.  Nonlinearities can be included in the formulation, although they generally introduce volume integrals which require the volume to be discretized before solution, removing an oft-cited advantage of BEM.\n\n===Fast multipole method ===\nThe [[fast multipole method]] (FMM) is an alternative to MoM or Ewald summation. It is an accurate simulation technique and requires less memory and processor power than MoM. The FMM was first introduced by [[Leslie Greengard|Greengard]] and [[Vladimir Rokhlin (American scientist)|Rokhlin]]<ref>Leslie Greengard and Vladimir Rokhlin (1987). \"[https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a169294.pdf A Fast Algorithm for Particle Simulations].\" J. Computational Physics Vol. 73, No. 2, pp 325\u2013348.</ref><ref>Vladimir Rokhlin (1985). \"Rapid Solution of Integral Equations of Classic Potential Theory.\" J. Computational Physics Vol. 60, pp. 187\u2013207.</ref> and is based on the [[multipole expansion]] technique. The first application of the FMM in computational electromagnetics was by Engheta et al.(1992).<ref>Nader Engheta, William D. Murphy, Vladimir Rokhlin, and Marius Vassiliou (1992), \"The Fast Multipole Method for Electromagnetic Scattering Computation,\" IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation 40, 634\u2013641.</ref>  FMM can also be used to accelerate MoM.\n\n===Plane wave time-domain ===\nWhile the fast multipole method is useful for accelerating MoM solutions of integral equations with static or frequency-domain oscillatory kernels, the '''plane wave time-domain (PWTD)''' algorithm employs similar ideas to accelerate the MoM solution of time-domain integral equations involving the [[retarded potential]]. The PWTD algorithm was introduced in 1998 by Ergin, Shanker, and Michielssen.<ref>Ergin, A. A., Shanker, B., & Michielssen, E. (1998). [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999198959083 Fast evaluation of three-dimensional transient wave fields using diagonal translation operators]. Journal of Computational Physics, 146(1), 157\u2013180.</ref>\n\n===Partial element equivalent circuit method===\nThe [[partial element equivalent circuit]] (PEEC) is a 3D full-wave modeling method suitable for combined [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] and [[Electronic circuit|circuit]] analysis. Unlike MoM, PEEC is a full [[spectrum]] method valid from [[Direct current|dc]] to the maximum [[frequency]] determined by the meshing. In the PEEC method, the [[integral equation]] is interpreted as [[Kirchhoff's voltage law]] applied to a basic PEEC cell which results in a complete circuit solution for 3D geometries. The equivalent circuit formulation allows for additional [[SPICE]] type circuit elements to be easily included. Further, the models and the analysis apply to both the time and the frequency domains. The circuit equations resulting from the PEEC model are easily constructed using a modified [[loop analysis]] (MLA) or [[modified nodal analysis]] (MNA) formulation. Besides providing a direct current solution, it has several other advantages over a MoM analysis for this class of problems since any type of circuit element can be included in a straightforward way with appropriate matrix stamps. The PEEC method has recently been extended to include nonorthogonal geometries.<ref>[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1200853 A. E. Ruehli, G. Antonini, J. Esch, J. Ekman, A. Mayo, A. Orlandi, \"Nonorthogonal PEEC formulation for time- and frequency-domain EM and circuit modeling,\" [[IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility|IEEE Trans. Electromagn. Compat.]], vol. 45, no. 2, pp. 167\u2013176, May 2003.]</ref> This model extension, which is consistent with the classical [[orthogonal]] formulation, includes the Manhattan representation of the geometries in addition to the more general [[quadrilateral]] and [[hexahedral]] elements. This helps in keeping the number of unknowns at a minimum and thus reduces computational time for nonorthogonal geometries.<ref>[http://www.sm.luth.se/~jekman/PEEC/Program/ Partial Element Equivalent Circuit (PEEC) homepage]</ref>\n\n==Differential equation solvers==\n\n===Finite-difference time-domain ===\n[[Finite-difference time-domain]] (FDTD) is a popular CEM technique. It is easy to understand. It has an exceptionally simple implementation for a full wave solver. It is at least an order of magnitude less work to implement a basic FDTD solver than either an FEM or MoM solver. FDTD is the only technique where one person can realistically implement oneself in a reasonable time frame, but even then, this will be for a quite specific problem.<ref name=\"davidson\">David B. Davidson, ''Computational Electromagnetics for RF and Microwave Engineering'', Second Edition, Cambridge University Press, 2010</ref> Since it is a time-domain method, solutions can cover a wide frequency range with a single simulation run, provided the time step is small enough to satisfy the [[Nyquist\u2013Shannon sampling theorem]] for the desired highest frequency.\n\nFDTD belongs in the general class of grid-based differential time-domain numerical modeling methods. [[Maxwell's equations]] (in [[Partial differential equation|partial differential]] form) are modified to central-difference equations, discretized, and implemented in software. The equations are solved in a cyclic manner:  the [[electric field]] is solved at a given instant in time, then the [[magnetic field]] is solved at the next instant in time, and the process is repeated over and over again.\n\nThe basic FDTD algorithm traces back to a seminal 1966 paper by Kane Yee in [[IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation]]. [[Allen Taflove]] originated the descriptor \"Finite-difference time-domain\" and its corresponding \"FDTD\" acronym in a 1980 paper in [[IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility|IEEE Trans. Electromagn. Compat.]]. Since about 1990, FDTD techniques have emerged as the primary means to model many scientific and engineering problems addressing electromagnetic wave interactions with material structures. An effective technique based on a time-domain finite-volume discretization procedure was introduced by Mohammadian et al. in 1991.<ref>Alireza H. Mohammadian, Vijaya Shankar, and William F. Hall (1991). \"[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001046559190199U Computation of Electromagnetic Scattering and Radiation Using a Time-Domain Finite-Volume Discretization Procedure]. Computer Physics Communications Vol. 68, No. 1, 175\u2013196.</ref>  Current FDTD modeling applications range from near-DC (ultralow-frequency geophysics involving the entire Earth-[[ionosphere]] waveguide) through [[microwave]]s (radar signature technology, antennas, wireless communications devices, digital interconnects, biomedical imaging/treatment) to visible light ([[photonic crystal]]s, nanoplasmonics, [[soliton]]s, and [[biophotonics]]).  Approximately 30 commercial and university-developed software suites are available.\n\n=== Discontinuous time-domain method ===\nAmong many time domain methods, discontinuous Galerkin time domain (DGTD) method has become popular recently since it integrates advantages of \u00a0both the finite volume time domain (FVTD) method and the finite element time domain (FETD) method. Like FVTD, the numerical flux is used to exchange information between neighboring elements, thus all operations of DGTD are local and easily parallelizable. Similar to FETD, DGTD employs unstructured mesh and capable of high-order accuracy if the high-order hierarchical basis function is adopted. With above merits, DGTD method is widely implemented for the transient analysis of multiscale problems involving large number of unknowns.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tob\u00f3n|first=Luis E.|last2=Ren|first2=Qiang|last3=Liu|first3=Qing Huo|date=February 2015|title=A new efficient 3D Discontinuous Galerkin Time Domain (DGTD) method for large and multiscale electromagnetic simulations|journal=Journal of Computational Physics|volume=283|pages=374\u2013387|doi=10.1016/j.jcp.2014.12.008|issn=0021-9991|bibcode=2015JCoPh.283..374T\n}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal\n  |last=Mai  |first=W.  |last2=Hu  |first2=J.  |last3=Li  |first3=P.  |last4=Zhao  |first4=H.\n  |date=October 2017\n  |title=An Efficient and Stable 2-D/3-D Hybrid Discontinuous Galerkin Time-Domain Analysis With Adaptive Criterion for Arbitrarily Shaped Antipads in Dispersive Parallel-Plate Pair\n  |journal=IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques\n  |volume=65  |issue=10\n  |pages=3671\u20133681\n  |doi=10.1109/TMTT.2017.2690286\n  |issn=0018-9480\n  |bibcode=2017ITMTT..65.3671M\n}}</ref>\n\n===Multiresolution time-domain===\nMRTD is an adaptive alternative to the finite difference time domain method (FDTD) based on [[wavelet]] analysis.\n\n===Finite element method ===\nThe [[finite element method]] (FEM) is used to find approximate solution of [[partial differential equation]]s (PDE) and [[integral equation]]s.  The solution approach is based either on eliminating the time derivatives completely (steady state problems), or rendering the PDE into an equivalent [[ordinary differential equation]], which is then solved using standard techniques such as [[finite difference]]s, etc.\n\nIn solving [[partial differential equation]]s, the primary challenge is to create an equation which approximates the equation to be studied, but which is [[numerically stable]], meaning that errors in the input data and intermediate calculations do not accumulate and destroy the meaning of the resulting output. There are many ways of doing this, with various advantages and disadvantages. The finite element method is a good choice for solving partial differential equations over complex domains or when the desired precision varies over the entire domain.\n\n===Pseudo-spectral time domain ===\nThis class of marching-in-time computational techniques for Maxwell's equations uses either discrete Fourier or [[discrete Chebyshev transform]]s to calculate the spatial derivatives of the electric and magnetic field vector components that are arranged in either a 2-D grid or 3-D lattice of unit cells. PSTD causes negligible numerical phase velocity anisotropy errors relative to FDTD, and therefore allows problems of much greater electrical size to be modeled.<ref>\nFor a recent comprehensive summary of PSTD techniques for Maxwell's equations, see Q. Liu and G. Zhao \"Advances in PSTD Techniques,\" Chapter 17 in Computational Electrodynamics: The Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method, A. Taflove and S. C. Hagness, eds., Boston: [[Artech House]], 2005.</ref>\n\n===Pseudo-spectral spatial domain ===\nPSSD solves Maxwell's equations by propagating them forward in a chosen spatial direction. The fields are therefore held as a function of time, and (possibly) any transverse spatial dimensions. The method is pseudo-spectral because temporal derivatives are calculated in the frequency domain with the aid of FFTs. Because the fields are held as functions of time, this enables arbitrary dispersion in the propagation medium to be rapidly and accurately modelled with minimal effort.<ref>\nJ.C.A. Tyrrell et al., [[Journal of Modern Optics]] 52, 973 (2005); {{doi|10.1080/09500340512331334086}}</ref> However, the choice to propagate forward in space (rather than in time) brings with it some subtleties, particularly if reflections are important.<ref>P. Kinsler, [[Phys. Rev. A]]81, 013819 (2010); {{doi|10.1103/PhysRevA.81.013819}}</ref>\n\n===Transmission line matrix ===\n[[Transmission line matrix method|Transmission line matrix]] (TLM) can be formulated in several means as a direct set of lumped elements solvable directly by a circuit solver (ala SPICE, [[HSPICE]], et al.), as a custom network of elements or via a [[scattering matrix]] approach.  TLM is a very flexible analysis strategy akin to FDTD in capabilities, though more codes tend to be available with FDTD engines.\n\n===Locally one-dimensional  ===\n\nThis is an implicit method. In this method, in two-dimensional case, Maxwell equations  are computed in two steps, whereas in three-dimensional case Maxwell equations are divided into three spatial coordinate directions. Stability and dispersion analysis of the three-dimensional LOD-FDTD method have been discussed in detail.<ref>I.Ahmed, E.K.Chua, E.P.Li, Z.Chen., [[IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation]] 56, 3596\u20133600 (2008)</ref><ref>I.Ahmed, E.K.Chua, E.P.Li., [[IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation]] 58, 3983\u20133989 (2010)</ref>\n\n==Other methods==\n\n===EigenMode expansion ===\n[[Eigenmode expansion]] (EME) is a rigorous bi-directional technique to simulate electromagnetic propagation which relies on the decomposition of the electromagnetic fields into a basis set of local eigenmodes. The eigenmodes are found by solving Maxwell's equations in each local cross-section. Eigenmode expansion can solve Maxwell's equations in 2D and 3D and can provide a fully vectorial solution provided that the mode solvers are vectorial. It offers very strong benefits compared with the FDTD method for the modelling of optical waveguides, and it is a popular tool for the modelling of [[fiber optics]] and [[silicon photonics]] devices.\n\n===Physical optics ===\n[[Physical optics]] (PO) is the name of a [[high frequency approximation]] (short-[[wavelength]] [[approximation]]) commonly used in optics, [[electrical engineering]] and [[applied physics]].  It is an intermediate method between geometric optics, which ignores [[wave]] effects, and full wave [[electromagnetism]], which is a precise [[theory]]. The word \"physical\" means that it is more physical than [[geometrical optics]] and not that it is an exact physical theory.\n\nThe approximation consists of using ray optics to estimate the field on a surface and then [[integral|integrating]] that field over the surface to calculate the transmitted or scattered field. This resembles the [[Born approximation]], in that the details of the problem are treated as a [[perturbation theory|perturbation]].\n\n===Uniform theory of diffraction ===\nThe [[uniform theory of diffraction]] (UTD) is a [[high frequency]] method for solving [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] [[scattering]] problems from electrically small discontinuities or discontinuities in more than one dimension at the same point.\n\nThe [[uniform theory of diffraction]] approximates [[near and far field|near field]] electromagnetic fields as quasi optical and uses ray diffraction to determine diffraction coefficients for each diffracting object-source combination. These coefficients are then used to calculate the field strength and [[phase (waves)|phase]] for each direction away from the diffracting point. These fields are then added to the incident fields and reflected fields to obtain a total solution.\n\n==Validation==\nValidation is one of the key issues facing electromagnetic simulation users. The user must understand and master the validity domain of its simulation. The measure is, \"how far from the reality are the results?\"\n\nAnswering  this question involves three steps: comparison between simulation results and analytical formulation, cross-comparison between codes, and comparison of simulation results with measurement.\n\n===Comparison between simulation results and analytical formulation===\nFor example, assessing the value of the [[radar cross section]] of a plate with the analytical formula:\n\n:: <math>\\text{RCS}_\\text{Plate} = \\frac{4 \\pi A^2}{\\lambda^2},</math>\n\n: where '''A''' is the surface of the plate and <math>\\lambda</math> is the wavelength. The next curve presenting the RCS of a plate computed at 35 [[GHz]] can be used as reference example.\n\n===Cross-comparison between codes===\nOne example is the cross comparison of results from method of moments and asymptotic methods in their validity domains.<ref>\nAs an illustration, the company [http://www.oktal-se.fr/ OKTAL-SE] made common development and cross comparison with the French research institute [http://www.onera.fr/ ONERA], comparing Method of Moment and Asymptotic methods. The cross comparison helped the validation process of the SE-RAY-EM code of OKTAL-SE. [http://www.oktal-se.fr/website/external/rcs_plate_35ghz.jpg Illustration]{{dead link|date=February 2017}} of the comparison between the SE-RAY-EM code and the ONERA reference code (right image).</ref>\n\n===Comparison of simulation results with measurement===\nThe final validation step is made by comparison between measurements and simulation. For example, the RCS calculation<ref>\n[http://www.oktal-se.fr/ SE-RAY-EM]</ref> and the measurement<ref>\n[http://www.fgan.de/ FGAN-FHR]</ref> of a complex metallic object at 35&nbsp;GHz.

What are the computational issues?''  {{Expand section|date=October 2008}} -->\nSeveral real-world electromagnetic problems like [[electromagnetic scattering]], [[electromagnetic radiation]], modeling of [[waveguide]]s etc., are not analytically calculable, for the multitude of irregular geometries found in actual devices. Computational numerical techniques can overcome the inability to derive closed form solutions of Maxwell's equations under various [[constitutive relation]]s of media, and [[boundary condition]]s. This makes ''computational electromagnetics'' (CEM) important to the design, and modeling of antenna, radar, [[communication satellite|satellite]] and other communication systems, [[nanophotonic]] devices and high speed [[silicon]] electronics, [[medical imaging]], cell-phone antenna design, among other applications.\n\nCEM typically solves the problem of computing the ''E'' (electric) and ''H'' (magnetic) fields across the problem domain (e.g., to calculate antenna [[radiation pattern]] for an arbitrarily shaped antenna structure). Also calculating power flow direction ([[Poynting vector]]), a waveguide's [[normal mode]]s, media-generated wave dispersion, and scattering can be computed from the ''E'' and ''H'' fields. CEM models may or may not assume [[symmetry]], simplifying real world structures to idealized [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]s, [[sphere]]s, and other regular geometrical objects. CEM models extensively make use of symmetry, and solve for reduced dimensionality from 3 spatial dimensions to 2D and even 1D.\n\nAn [[Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace|eigenvalue]] problem formulation of CEM allows us to calculate steady state normal modes in a structure. [[Transient response]] and impulse field effects are more accurately modeled by CEM in time domain, by [[FDTD]]. Curved geometrical objects are treated more accurately as finite elements [[Finite element method|FEM]], or non-orthogonal grids. [[Beam propagation method]] (BPM) can solve for the power flow in waveguides. CEM is application specific, even if different techniques converge to the same field and power distributions in the modeled domain.\n\n==Overview of methods==\nOne approach is to discretize the space in terms of grids (both orthogonal, and non-orthogonal) and solving Maxwell's equations at each point in the grid. Discretization consumes computer memory, and solving the equations takes significant time. Large-scale CEM problems face memory and CPU limitations. As of 2007, CEM problems require supercomputers,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} high performance clusters,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} vector processors and/or [[parallel computer|parallelism]]. Typical formulations involve either time-stepping through the equations over the whole domain for each time instant; or through banded [[matrix inversion]] to calculate the weights of basis functions, when modeled by finite element methods; or matrix products when using transfer matrix methods; or calculating [[integral]]s when using [[Boundary element method|method of moments]] (MoM); or using [[fast fourier transform]]s, and time iterations when calculating by the split-step method or by BPM.\n\n==Choice of methods==\nChoosing the right technique for solving a problem is important, as choosing the wrong one can either result in incorrect results, or results which take excessively long to compute. However, the name of a technique does not always tell one how it is implemented, especially for commercial tools, which will often have more than one solver.\n\nDavidson<ref name=\"davidson\" /> gives two tables comparing the FEM, MoM and FDTD techniques in the way they are normally implemented. One table is for both open region (radiation and scattering problems) and another table is for guided wave problems.\n\n==Maxwell's equations in hyperbolic PDE form==\nMaxwell's equations can be formulated as a [[hyperbolic system]] of [[partial differential equation]]s.  This gives access to powerful techniques for numerical solutions.\n\nIt is assumed that the waves propagate in the (''x'',''y'')-plane and restrict the direction of the magnetic field to be parallel to the ''z''-axis and thus the electric field to be parallel to the (''x'',''y'') plane. The wave is called a transverse magnetic (TM) wave.  In 2D and no polarization terms present, Maxwell's equations can then be formulated as:\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\bar{u} + A\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\bar{u} + B\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\bar{u} +C\\bar{u} = \\bar{g}</math>\n\nwhere ''u'', ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' are defined as\n\n:<math>\\bar{u}=\\left(\\begin{matrix} E_x \\\\ E_y \\\\ H_z \\end{matrix}\\right),</math>\n\n:<math>A=\\left(\\begin{matrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{\\mu} & 0 \\end{matrix}\\right),</math>\n\n:<math>B=\\left(\\begin{matrix} 0 & 0 & \\frac{-1}{\\epsilon} \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\frac{-1}{\\mu} & 0 & 0 \\end{matrix}\\right),</math>\n\n:<math>C=\\left(\\begin{matrix} \\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{matrix}\\right).</math>\n\nIn this representation, <math>\\bar{g}</math> is the [[forcing function (differential equations)|forcing function]], and is in the same space as <math>\\bar{u}</math>.  It can be used to express an externally applied field or to describe an optimization [[constraint (mathematics)|constraint]].  As formulated above:\n:<math>\\bar{g}=\\left(\\begin{matrix} E_{x, constraint} \\\\ E_{y, constraint} \\\\ H_{z, constraint} \\end{matrix}\\right).</math>\n\n<math>\\bar{g}</math> may also be explicitly defined equal to zero to simplify certain problems, or to find a [[Generalized eigenvector|characteristic solution]], which is often the first step in a method to find the particular inhomogeneous solution.\n\n==Integral equation solvers==\n\n===The discrete dipole approximation===\nThe [[discrete dipole approximation]] is a flexible technique for computing scattering and absorption by targets of arbitrary [[geometry]]. The formulation is based on integral form of Maxwell equations. The DDA is an approximation of the continuum target by a finite array of polarizable points. The points acquire [[Magnetic moment|dipole moment]]s in response to the local electric field. The dipoles of course interact with one another via their electric fields, so the DDA is also sometimes referred to as the coupled [[dipole]] approximation. The resulting linear system of equations is commonly solved using [[conjugate gradient]] iterations. The discretization matrix has symmetries (the integral form of Maxwell equations has form of convolution) enabling [[Fast Fourier Transform]] to multiply matrix times vector during conjugate gradient iterations.\n\n===Method of moments element method ===\nThe method of moments (MoM)<ref>Roger F. Harrington (1968). Field Computation by Moment Methods. Latest printing by IEEE Press in 1993, {{ISBN|0780310144}}.</ref> or [[boundary element method]] (BEM) is a numerical computational method of solving linear partial differential equations which have been formulated as [[integral equation]]s (i.e. in ''boundary integral'' form). It can be applied in many areas of engineering and science including [[fluid mechanics]], [[acoustics]], [[electromagnetics]], [[fracture mechanics]], and [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]].\n\nMoM has become more popular since the 1980s. Because it requires calculating only boundary values, rather than values throughout the space, it is significantly more efficient in terms of computational resources for problems with a small surface/volume ratio. Conceptually, it works by constructing a \"mesh\" over the modeled surface.  However, for many problems, BEM are significantly computationally less efficient than volume-discretization methods ([[finite element method]], [[finite difference method]], [[finite volume method]]).  Boundary element formulations typically give rise to fully populated matrices. This means that the storage requirements and computational time will tend to grow according to the square of the problem size.  By contrast, finite element matrices are typically banded (elements are only locally connected) and the storage requirements for the system matrices typically grow linearly with the problem size.  Compression techniques (''e.g.'' multipole expansions or adaptive cross approximation/hierarchical matrices) can be used to ameliorate these problems, though at the cost of added complexity and with a success-rate that depends heavily on the nature and geometry of the problem.\n\nBEM is applicable to problems for which [[Green's function]]s can be calculated.  These usually involve fields in [[linear]] [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]] media.  This places considerable restrictions on the range and generality of problems suitable for boundary elements.  Nonlinearities can be included in the formulation, although they generally introduce volume integrals which require the volume to be discretized before solution, removing an oft-cited advantage of BEM.\n\n===Fast multipole method ===\nThe [[fast multipole method]] (FMM) is an alternative to MoM or Ewald summation. It is an accurate simulation technique and requires less memory and processor power than MoM. The FMM was first introduced by [[Leslie Greengard|Greengard]] and [[Vladimir Rokhlin (American scientist)|Rokhlin]]<ref>Leslie Greengard and Vladimir Rokhlin (1987). \"[https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a169294.pdf A Fast Algorithm for Particle Simulations].\" J. Computational Physics Vol. 73, No. 2, pp 325\u2013348.</ref><ref>Vladimir Rokhlin (1985). \"Rapid Solution of Integral Equations of Classic Potential Theory.\" J. Computational Physics Vol. 60, pp. 187\u2013207.</ref> and is based on the [[multipole expansion]] technique. The first application of the FMM in computational electromagnetics was by Engheta et al.(1992).<ref>Nader Engheta, William D. Murphy, Vladimir Rokhlin, and Marius Vassiliou (1992), \"The Fast Multipole Method for Electromagnetic Scattering Computation,\" IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation 40, 634\u2013641.</ref>  FMM can also be used to accelerate MoM.\n\n===Plane wave time-domain ===\nWhile the fast multipole method is useful for accelerating MoM solutions of integral equations with static or frequency-domain oscillatory kernels, the '''plane wave time-domain (PWTD)''' algorithm employs similar ideas to accelerate the MoM solution of time-domain integral equations involving the [[retarded potential]]. The PWTD algorithm was introduced in 1998 by Ergin, Shanker, and Michielssen.<ref>Ergin, A. A., Shanker, B., & Michielssen, E. (1998).

Journal of Computational Physics, 146(1), 157\u2013180.</ref>\n\n===Partial element equivalent circuit method===\nThe [[partial element equivalent circuit]] (PEEC) is a 3D full-wave modeling method suitable for combined [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] and [[Electronic circuit|circuit]] analysis. Unlike MoM, PEEC is a full [[spectrum]] method valid from [[Direct current|dc]] to the maximum [[frequency]] determined by the meshing. In the PEEC method, the [[integral equation]] is interpreted as [[Kirchhoff's voltage law]] applied to a basic PEEC cell which results in a complete circuit solution for 3D geometries. The equivalent circuit formulation allows for additional [[SPICE]] type circuit elements to be easily included. Further, the models and the analysis apply to both the time and the frequency domains. The circuit equations resulting from the PEEC model are easily constructed using a modified [[loop analysis]] (MLA) or [[modified nodal analysis]] (MNA) formulation. Besides providing a direct current solution, it has several other advantages over a MoM analysis for this class of problems since any type of circuit element can be included in a straightforward way with appropriate matrix stamps. The PEEC method has recently been extended to include nonorthogonal geometries.<ref>[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1200853 A. E. Ruehli, G. Antonini, J. Esch, J. Ekman, A. Mayo, A. Orlandi, \"Nonorthogonal PEEC formulation for time- and frequency-domain EM and circuit modeling,\" [[IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility|IEEE Trans. Electromagn. Compat.]], vol. 45, no. 2, pp. 167\u2013176, May 2003.]</ref> This model extension, which is consistent with the classical [[orthogonal]] formulation, includes the Manhattan representation of the geometries in addition to the more general [[quadrilateral]] and [[hexahedral]] elements. This helps in keeping the number of unknowns at a minimum and thus reduces computational time for nonorthogonal geometries.<ref>[http://www.sm.luth.se/~jekman/PEEC/Program/ Partial Element Equivalent Circuit (PEEC) homepage]</ref>\n\n==Differential equation solvers==\n\n===Finite-difference time-domain ===\n[[Finite-difference time-domain]] (FDTD) is a popular CEM technique. It is easy to understand. It has an exceptionally simple implementation for a full wave solver. It is at least an order of magnitude less work to implement a basic FDTD solver than either an FEM or MoM solver. FDTD is the only technique where one person can realistically implement oneself in a reasonable time frame, but even then, this will be for a quite specific problem.<ref name=\"davidson\">David B. Davidson, ''Computational Electromagnetics for RF and Microwave Engineering'', Second Edition, Cambridge University Press, 2010</ref> Since it is a time-domain method, solutions can cover a wide frequency range with a single simulation run, provided the time step is small enough to satisfy the [[Nyquist\u2013Shannon sampling theorem]] for the desired highest frequency.\n\nFDTD belongs in the general class of grid-based differential time-domain numerical modeling methods. [[Maxwell's equations]] (in [[Partial differential equation|partial differential]] form) are modified to central-difference equations, discretized, and implemented in software. The equations are solved in a cyclic manner:  the [[electric field]] is solved at a given instant in time, then the [[magnetic field]] is solved at the next instant in time, and the process is repeated over and over again.\n\nThe basic FDTD algorithm traces back to a seminal 1966 paper by Kane Yee in [[IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation]]. [[Allen Taflove]] originated the descriptor \"Finite-difference time-domain\" and its corresponding \"FDTD\" acronym in a 1980 paper in [[IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility|IEEE Trans. Electromagn. Compat.]]. Since about 1990, FDTD techniques have emerged as the primary means to model many scientific and engineering problems addressing electromagnetic wave interactions with material structures. An effective technique based on a time-domain finite-volume discretization procedure was introduced by Mohammadian et al. in 1991.<ref>Alireza H. Mohammadian, Vijaya Shankar, and William F. Hall (1991). \"[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001046559190199U Computation of Electromagnetic Scattering and Radiation Using a Time-Domain Finite-Volume Discretization Procedure]. Computer Physics Communications Vol. 68, No. 1, 175\u2013196.</ref>  Current FDTD modeling applications range from near-DC (ultralow-frequency geophysics involving the entire Earth-[[ionosphere]] waveguide) through [[microwave]]s (radar signature technology, antennas, wireless communications devices, digital interconnects, biomedical imaging/treatment) to visible light ([[photonic crystal]]s, nanoplasmonics, [[soliton]]s, and [[biophotonics]]).  Approximately 30 commercial and university-developed software suites are available.\n\n=== Discontinuous time-domain method ===\nAmong many time domain methods, discontinuous Galerkin time domain (DGTD) method has become popular recently since it integrates advantages of \u00a0both the finite volume time domain (FVTD) method and the finite element time domain (FETD) method. Like FVTD, the numerical flux is used to exchange information between neighboring elements, thus all operations of DGTD are local and easily parallelizable. Similar to FETD, DGTD employs unstructured mesh and capable of high-order accuracy if the high-order hierarchical basis function is adopted. With above merits, DGTD method is widely implemented for the transient analysis of multiscale problems involving large number of unknowns.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tob\u00f3n|first=Luis E.|last2=Ren|first2=Qiang|last3=Liu|first3=Qing Huo|date=February 2015|title=A new efficient 3D Discontinuous Galerkin Time Domain (DGTD) method for large and multiscale electromagnetic simulations|journal=Journal of Computational Physics|volume=283|pages=374\u2013387|doi=10.1016/j.jcp.2014.12.008|issn=0021-9991|bibcode=2015JCoPh.283..374T\n}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal\n  |last=Mai  |first=W.  |last2=Hu  |first2=J.  |last3=Li  |first3=P.  |last4=Zhao  |first4=H.\n  |date=October 2017\n  |title=An Efficient and Stable 2-D/3-D Hybrid Discontinuous Galerkin Time-Domain Analysis With Adaptive Criterion for Arbitrarily Shaped Antipads in Dispersive Parallel-Plate Pair\n  |journal=IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques\n  |volume=65  |issue=10\n  |pages=3671\u20133681\n  |doi=10.1109/TMTT.2017.2690286\n  |issn=0018-9480\n  |bibcode=2017ITMTT..65.3671M\n}}</ref>\n\n===Multiresolution time-domain===\nMRTD is an adaptive alternative to the finite difference time domain method (FDTD) based on [[wavelet]] analysis.\n\n===Finite element method ===\nThe [[finite element method]] (FEM) is used to find approximate solution of [[partial differential equation]]s (PDE) and [[integral equation]]s.  The solution approach is based either on eliminating the time derivatives completely (steady state problems), or rendering the PDE into an equivalent [[ordinary differential equation]], which is then solved using standard techniques such as [[finite difference]]s, etc.\n\nIn solving [[partial differential equation]]s, the primary challenge is to create an equation which approximates the equation to be studied, but which is [[numerically stable]], meaning that errors in the input data and intermediate calculations do not accumulate and destroy the meaning of the resulting output. There are many ways of doing this, with various advantages and disadvantages. The finite element method is a good choice for solving partial differential equations over complex domains or when the desired precision varies over the entire domain.\n\n===Finite integration technique ===\nThe finite integration technique (FIT) is a spatial discretization scheme to numerically solve electromagnetic field problems in time and frequency domain. It preserves basic [[topological]] properties of the continuous equations such as conservation of charge and energy. FIT was proposed in 1977 by [[w:de:Thomas Weiland|Thomas Weiland]] and has been enhanced continually over the years.<ref>\nT. Weiland, A Discretization Method for the Solution of Maxwell's Equations for Six-Component Fields, Electronics and Communications AEUE, vol. 31, no. 3, pp. 116\u2013120, 1977.</ref> This method covers the full range of electromagnetics (from static up to high frequency) and optic applications and is the basis for commercial simulation tools.<ref>\nCST Studio Suite developed by [[Computer Simulation Technology]] (CST AG).</ref>{{failed verification|date=April 2013}}<ref>\nElectromagnetic Simulation solutions developed by [[Nimbic]].</ref>{{failed verification|date=April 2013}}\n\nThe basic idea of this approach is to apply the Maxwell equations in integral form to a set of staggered grids. This method stands out due to high flexibility in geometric modeling and boundary handling as well as incorporation of arbitrary material distributions and material properties such as [[anisotropy]], non-linearity and dispersion. Furthermore, the use of a consistent dual orthogonal grid (e.g. [[Cartesian grid]]) in conjunction with an explicit time integration scheme (e.g. leap-frog-scheme) leads to compute and memory-efficient algorithms, which are especially adapted for transient field analysis in [[radio frequency]] (RF) applications.\n\n===Pseudo-spectral time domain ===\nThis class of marching-in-time computational techniques for Maxwell's equations uses either discrete Fourier or [[discrete Chebyshev transform]]s to calculate the spatial derivatives of the electric and magnetic field vector components that are arranged in either a 2-D grid or 3-D lattice of unit cells. PSTD causes negligible numerical phase velocity anisotropy errors relative to FDTD, and therefore allows problems of much greater electrical size to be modeled.<ref>\nFor a recent comprehensive summary of PSTD techniques for Maxwell's equations, see Q. Liu and G. Zhao \"Advances in PSTD Techniques,\" Chapter 17 in Computational Electrodynamics: The Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method, A. Taflove and S. C. Hagness, eds., Boston: [[Artech House]], 2005.</ref>\n\n===Pseudo-spectral spatial domain ===\nPSSD solves Maxwell's equations by propagating them forward in a chosen spatial direction. The fields are therefore held as a function of time, and (possibly) any transverse spatial dimensions. The method is pseudo-spectral because temporal derivatives are calculated in the frequency domain with the aid of FFTs. Because the fields are held as functions of time, this enables arbitrary dispersion in the propagation medium to be rapidly and accurately modelled with minimal effort.<ref>\nJ.C.A. Tyrrell et al., [[Journal of Modern Optics]] 52, 973 (2005); {{doi|10.1080/09500340512331334086}}</ref> However, the choice to propagate forward in space (rather than in time) brings with it some subtleties, particularly if reflections are important.<ref>P. Kinsler, [[Phys. Rev. A]]81, 013819 (2010); {{doi|10.1103/PhysRevA.81.013819}}</ref>\n\n===Transmission line matrix ===\n[[Transmission line matrix method|Transmission line matrix]] (TLM) can be formulated in several means as a direct set of lumped elements solvable directly by a circuit solver (ala SPICE, [[HSPICE]], et al.), as a custom network of elements or via a [[scattering matrix]] approach.  TLM is a very flexible analysis strategy akin to FDTD in capabilities, though more codes tend to be available with FDTD engines.\n\n===Locally one-dimensional  ===\n\nThis is an implicit method. In this method, in two-dimensional case, Maxwell equations  are computed in two steps, whereas in three-dimensional case Maxwell equations are divided into three spatial coordinate directions. Stability and dispersion analysis of the three-dimensional LOD-FDTD method have been discussed in detail.<ref>I.Ahmed, E.K.Chua, E.P.Li, Z.Chen., [[IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation]] 56, 3596\u20133600 (2008)</ref><ref>I.Ahmed, E.K.Chua, E.P.Li., [[IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation]] 58, 3983\u20133989 (2010)</ref>\n\n==Other methods==\n\n===EigenMode expansion ===\n[[Eigenmode expansion]] (EME) is a rigorous bi-directional technique to simulate electromagnetic propagation which relies on the decomposition of the electromagnetic fields into a basis set of local eigenmodes. The eigenmodes are found by solving Maxwell's equations in each local cross-section. Eigenmode expansion can solve Maxwell's equations in 2D and 3D and can provide a fully vectorial solution provided that the mode solvers are vectorial. It offers very strong benefits compared with the FDTD method for the modelling of optical waveguides, and it is a popular tool for the modelling of [[fiber optics]] and [[silicon photonics]] devices.\n\n===Physical optics ===\n[[Physical optics]] (PO) is the name of a [[high frequency approximation]] (short-[[wavelength]] [[approximation]]) commonly used in optics, [[electrical engineering]] and [[applied physics]].  It is an intermediate method between geometric optics, which ignores [[wave]] effects, and full wave [[electromagnetism]], which is a precise [[theory]]. The word \"physical\" means that it is more physical than [[geometrical optics]] and not that it is an exact physical theory.\n\nThe approximation consists of using ray optics to estimate the field on a surface and then [[integral|integrating]] that field over the surface to calculate the transmitted or scattered field. This resembles the [[Born approximation]], in that the details of the problem are treated as a [[perturbation theory|perturbation]].\n\n===Uniform theory of diffraction ===\nThe [[uniform theory of diffraction]] (UTD) is a [[high frequency]] method for solving [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] [[scattering]] problems from electrically small discontinuities or discontinuities in more than one dimension at the same point.\n\nThe [[uniform theory of diffraction]] approximates [[near and far field|near field]] electromagnetic fields as quasi optical and uses ray diffraction to determine diffraction coefficients for each diffracting object-source combination. These coefficients are then used to calculate the field strength and [[phase (waves)|phase]] for each direction away from the diffracting point. These fields are then added to the incident fields and reflected fields to obtain a total solution.\n\n==Validation==\nValidation is one of the key issues facing electromagnetic simulation users. The user must understand and master the validity domain of its simulation. The measure is, \"how far from the reality are the results?\"\n\nAnswering  this question involves three steps: comparison between simulation results and analytical formulation, cross-comparison between codes, and comparison of simulation results with measurement.\n\n===Comparison between simulation results and analytical formulation===\nFor example, assessing the value of the [[radar cross section]] of a plate with the analytical formula:\n\n:: <math>\\text{RCS}_\\text{Plate} = \\frac{4 \\pi A^2}{\\lambda^2},</math>\n\n: where '''A''' is the surface of the plate and <math>\\lambda</math> is the wavelength. The next curve presenting the RCS of a plate computed at 35 [[GHz]] can be used as reference example.\n\n===Cross-comparison between codes===\nOne example is the cross comparison of results from method of moments and asymptotic methods in their validity domains.<ref>\nAs an illustration, the company [http://www.oktal-se.fr/ OKTAL-SE] made common development and cross comparison with the French research institute [http://www.onera.fr/ ONERA], comparing Method of Moment and Asymptotic methods. The cross comparison helped the validation process of the SE-RAY-EM code of OKTAL-SE.

For example, the RCS calculation<ref>\n[http://www.oktal-se.fr/ SE-RAY-EM]</ref> and the measurement<ref>\n[http://www.fgan.de/ FGAN-FHR]</ref> of a complex metallic object at 35&nbsp;GHz.

He is known as \"Bird\" or the \"Birdman\".\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Parents===\nEagle was born to entertainers [[Jack Eagle]] and Monica Maris. Jack, a former \"Catskills comedian\" and commercial actor, was best known for portraying \"Brother Dominic\" and \"Mr. Cholesterol\" in [[Xerox]] and [[Fleischmann's margarine]] television commercials respectively in the 1970s.

While at Syracuse, he was in the [[Alpha Epsilon Pi]] fraternity. Following his graduation in 1990, Eagle began working for [[WFAN]] Radio in New York City as a producer. In 1992, WFAN gave him his own show (Bagels and Baseball). In [[1993 NFL season|1993]], Eagle was given pregame and postgame duties for the Jets. [[1994\u201395 NBA season|1994]] saw Eagle's first year as a Nets [[play-by-play]] radio announcer. A year later, he was made a TV announcer for [[SportsChannel America|SportsChannel]], which later became [[Fox Sports Net|Fox Sports Net New York]] (now [[MSG Plus]]). In [[1997 NFL season|1997]], WFAN made Eagle play-by-play announcer for Jets games.\n\n===Later television and radio career===\nEagle joined CBS in 1998 doing announcing work for NFL and NCAA basketball. He continues to serve these roles today. In 2010, he joined [[Dan Fouts]] to make up the number three broadcast team for CBS' NFL coverage. The pair was elevated to the number two team behind [[Jim Nantz]] and [[Phil Simms]] in the 2014 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/24584815/cbs-sports-2014-booth-pairings-ian-eagle-dan-fouts-named-no-2-team|title=CBS Sports 2014 booth pairings: Ian Eagle, Dan Fouts named No. 2 team}}</ref> He and Fouts, still on the second team, call an AFC Divisional Playoff game every other year, most recently the 2019 AFC Divisional matchup between the Titans and the Ravens. Other CBS work includes [[boxing]], [[Pilot Pen Tennis|The Pilot Pen Tennis tournament]], the [[U.S. Open (tennis)|U.S. Open]] (both the late night show and daytime studio host for [[2008 U.S. Open (tennis)|2008 U.S. Open]] coverage), and the NCAA Track and Field Championships.\n\nPrior to joining the YES Network as Nets announcer in [[2002-03 NBA season|2002]], Ian Eagle served the same role for the Nets on the [[MSG (TV network)|MSG Network]] and [[Fox Sports Net New York]]. When [[Marv Albert]] joined the YES Network prior to the [[2005-06 NBA season]], the games were split between the two broadcasters, before Eagle again became the primary announcer for the Nets in the [[2011-12 NBA season]] upon Albert's departure.\n\nDuring the [[2010 NBA Playoffs]], Eagle called two games on [[NBA on TNT|TNT]], a likely move to promote him to calling national television broadcasts, similar to what Albert, former [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] play-by-play man [[Kevin Harlan]] and [[New York Knicks|Knicks]] play-by-play man [[Mike Breen]] experienced. He was again called up by TNT for the [[2011 NBA Playoffs]], pairing with his YES colleague Mike Fratello. He has since continued to cover the NBA Playoffs for TNT through the first 2 rounds, though the amount of games fluctuates on whether the Nets make the playoffs (in 2019, with the Nets making the playoffs, he instead covered the team locally on YES and missed the entire 1st round of TNT coverage, with [[Spero Dedes]] filling-in. He returned to cover part of the Toronto-76ers 2nd round series for TNT). He also does play-by-play for ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'' on [[Westwood One (1976\u20132011)|Westwood One]]. On Sirius, in addition to his daily talk show, Eagle did a weekly talk show, ''The Phil Jackson Show'', with [[Los Angeles Lakers]] coach [[Phil Jackson]]. And Eagle retains his roots to WFAN, occasionally serving as a fill-in talk show host on his old station.\n\nEagle also serves as the voice-over host of ''[[NBA Action]]'' and previously, ''[[NBA Jam (2010 video game)|NBA Jam]]''. In 2013, he called the international telecasts of the [[2013 NBA Finals]] alongside [[Jim Spanarkel]], his partner on Nets broadcasts on YES.\n\nPrior to the 2019-20 NBA season, it was announced that as a replacement to the recently eliminated \"Players Only\" broadcasts which occurred on Tuesday nights beginning during the 2nd half of the season, TNT would instate a more traditional broadcast format to their Tuesday Night slate of games. Eagle was announced to be one of the play-by-play announcers to the weekly scheduled doubleheader, along with Brewers announcer [[Brian Anderson (sportscaster)|Brian Anderson]]. Eagle will be partnered with either [[Stan Van Gundy]] or [[Jim Jackson (basketball)|Jim Jackson]].\n\nSince Eagle pronounces his first name \"EYE-un\" (instead of the more common \"EE-an\"), he has often admitted that life was easier prior to the 1986 release of the movie ''[[Iron Eagle]]''. In fact, many callers (including prominent sports figures) continue to call him \"Iron Eagle\"\u2014much to his chagrin.\n\n=== Notable Calls ===\n'''June 18, 2013''' \u2013 Eagle was the play-by-play announcer for the international telecasts of the [[2013 NBA Finals]].

He is known as \"Bird\" or the \"Birdman\".\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Parents===\nEagle was born to entertainers [[Jack Eagle]] and Monica Maris. Jack, a former \"Catskills comedian\" and commercial actor, was best known for portraying \"Brother Dominic\" and \"Mr. Cholesterol\" in [[Xerox]] and [[Fleischmann's margarine]] television commercials respectively in the 1970s.

While at Syracuse, he was in the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity. Following his graduation in 1990, Eagle began working for [[WFAN]] Radio in New York City as a producer. In 1992, WFAN gave him his own show (Bagels and Baseball). In [[1993 NFL season|1993]], Eagle was given pregame and postgame duties for the Jets. [[1994\u201395 NBA season|1994]] saw Eagle's first year as a Nets [[play-by-play]] radio announcer. A year later, he was made a TV announcer for [[SportsChannel America|SportsChannel]], which later became [[Fox Sports Net|Fox Sports Net New York]] (now [[MSG Plus]]). In [[1997 NFL season|1997]], WFAN made Eagle play-by-play announcer for Jets games.\n\n===Later television and radio career===\nEagle joined CBS in 1998 doing announcing work for NFL and NCAA basketball. He continues to serve these roles today. In 2010, he joined [[Dan Fouts]] to make up the number three broadcast team for CBS' NFL coverage. The pair was elevated to the number two team behind [[Jim Nantz]] and [[Phil Simms]] in the 2014 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/24584815/cbs-sports-2014-booth-pairings-ian-eagle-dan-fouts-named-no-2-team|title=CBS Sports 2014 booth pairings: Ian Eagle, Dan Fouts named No. 2 team}}</ref> He and Fouts, still on the second team, call an AFC Divisional Playoff game every other year, most recently the 2019 AFC Divisional matchup between the Titans and the Ravens. Other CBS work includes [[boxing]], [[Pilot Pen Tennis|The Pilot Pen Tennis tournament]], the [[U.S. Open (tennis)|U.S. Open]] (both the late night show and daytime studio host for [[2008 U.S. Open (tennis)|2008 U.S. Open]] coverage), and the NCAA Track and Field Championships.\n\nPrior to joining the YES Network as Nets announcer in [[2002-03 NBA season|2002]], Ian Eagle served the same role for the Nets on the [[MSG (TV network)|MSG Network]] and [[Fox Sports Net New York]]. When [[Marv Albert]] joined the YES Network prior to the [[2005-06 NBA season]], the games were split between the two broadcasters, before Eagle again became the primary announcer for the Nets in the [[2011-12 NBA season]] upon Albert's departure.\n\nDuring the [[2010 NBA Playoffs]], Eagle called two games on [[NBA on TNT|TNT]], a likely move to promote him to calling national television broadcasts, similar to what Albert, former [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] play-by-play man [[Kevin Harlan]] and [[New York Knicks|Knicks]] play-by-play man [[Mike Breen]] experienced. He was again called up by TNT for the [[2011 NBA Playoffs]], pairing with his YES colleague Mike Fratello. He has since continued to cover the NBA Playoffs for TNT through the first 2 rounds, though the amount of games fluctuates on whether the Nets make the playoffs (in 2019, with the Nets making the playoffs, he instead covered the team locally on YES and missed the entire 1st round of TNT coverage, with [[Spero Dedes]] filling-in. He returned to cover part of the Toronto-76ers 2nd round series for TNT). He also does play-by-play for ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'' on [[Westwood One (1976\u20132011)|Westwood One]]. On Sirius, in addition to his daily talk show, Eagle did a weekly talk show, ''The Phil Jackson Show'', with [[Los Angeles Lakers]] coach [[Phil Jackson]]. And Eagle retains his roots to WFAN, occasionally serving as a fill-in talk show host on his old station.\n\nEagle also serves as the voice-over host of ''[[NBA Action]]'' and previously, ''[[NBA Jam (2010 video game)|NBA Jam]]''. In 2013, he called the international telecasts of the [[2013 NBA Finals]] alongside [[Jim Spanarkel]], his partner on Nets broadcasts on YES.\n\nPrior to the 2019-20 NBA season, it was announced that as a replacement to the recently eliminated \"Players Only\" broadcasts which occurred on Tuesday nights beginning during the 2nd half of the season, TNT would instate a more traditional broadcast format to their Tuesday Night slate of games. Eagle was announced to be one of the play-by-play announcers to the weekly scheduled doubleheader, along with Brewers announcer [[Brian Anderson (sportscaster)|Brian Anderson]]. Eagle will be partnered with either [[Stan Van Gundy]] or [[Jim Jackson (basketball)|Jim Jackson]].\n\nSince Eagle pronounces his first name \"EYE-un\" (instead of the more common \"EE-an\"), he has often admitted that life was easier prior to the 1986 release of the movie ''[[Iron Eagle]]''. In fact, many callers (including prominent sports figures) continue to call him \"Iron Eagle\"\u2014much to his chagrin.\n\n=== Notable Calls ===\n'''June 18, 2013''' \u2013 Eagle was the play-by-play announcer for the international telecasts of the [[2013 NBA Finals]]. In Game 6, [[Ray Allen]] hit a 3 pointer to tie the game with 5.2 seconds left in the 4th quarter to keep Miami's championship hopes alive.<ref>{{Citation|last=Kietasss|title=Ray Allen AMAZING game-tying 3 vs Spurs (Ian Eagle call)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLLXM4UPfU8|access-date=2019-01-20}}</ref> Eagle's call of the play:\n<blockquote>\n15 seconds to play, [[Mario Chalmers|Chalmers]] has made big shots in his career.

It is an island nation that exists in Marvel's main [[shared universe]], known as \"Earth 616\" in the [[Marvel Universe]] and a prominent place in the [[X-Men]] chronology. The fictional nation served as an [[allegory]] for [[slavery]] and later for [[South Africa]]n [[apartheid]] before becoming a mutant [[homeland]] and subsequently a disaster zone.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} The island is located off the Southeastern African coast northwest from [[Seychelles]] and northeast of [[Madagascar]]. Its capital city was Hammer Bay.\n\n==Publication history==\nGenosha first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #235 (October 1988), and was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Rick Leonardi]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=148}}</ref>\n\nGenosha received an entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89]]'' #3.\n\n==Fictional country history==\n\n===Mutant apartheid===\nThe island is located off the east coast of [[Africa]], to the north of [[Madagascar]], and boasted a high standard of living, an excellent economy, and freedom from the political and racial turmoil that characterized neighboring nations. However, Genosha's prosperity was built upon the enslavement of its [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] population. Mutants in Genosha were the property of the state and children who were positively identified with the mutant gene were put through a process developed by [[David Moreau]], commonly known as the Genegineer, stripped of free will and made into \"mutates\" (a Marvel term for genetically modified individuals, as opposed to those who developed mutant powers naturally). The Genegineer was also capable of modifying certain mutant abilities in order to fulfill specific labor shortages. Citizenship in Genosha is permanent and the government does not recognize any emigration. Citizens who attempt to leave the country are tracked down and forcibly brought back to the island by the special force known as [[Press Gang (comics)|Press Gang]]. The Press Gang consisted of Hawkshaw, Pipeline, and Punchout, and were aided in their task by [[Wipeout (comics)|Wipeout]]. Mutant problems are handled by a special group known as the [[Magistrates (comics)|Magistrates]]. The foundations of Genoshan society has been upset in recent years due to the efforts of outside mutant interests. In the first storyline to feature the nation, some members of the [[X-Men]] ([[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], and their ally [[Madelyne Pryor]]) were kidnapped by Genoshan Magistrates, under the order of the Genegineer.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #235-238. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later, in the multi-issue, multi-title ''[[X-Tinction Agenda]]'' storyline, the X-Men and their allies rescued their teammates, [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Tabitha Smith|Meltdown]], [[Rictor]] and [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]], from Genoshan brainwashing, toppling the government after discovering their alliance with former [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] ally turned mutant hater, [[Cameron Hodge]], and that [[Havok (comics)|Havok]] was one of the Magistrates since having his memory wiped by the Siege Perilous. Havok himself, woken from his conditioning by his brother [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] dealt the killing blow to Cameron Hodge in the process.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men '' #270-272, ''New Mutants'' #95-97, ''X-Factor'' #60-62. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Conflict and Magneto's reign===\nA new Genoshan regime that promised better treatment of mutants was put in place after Hodge's destruction. A period of general turmoil and a number of attacks by superhumans, including [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]'s [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]] who were unwilling to forgive the former Genoshan government for its crimes against mutants, followed.{{Issue|date=September 2010}}\n\nA different version of X-Factor, including Wolfsbane, later returned to the island to help restore peace between its government and a rogue group of super-powered beings that had fled the island. The Genoshan government was shown with peaceful intentions, even trying to undo the ill effects visited upon Wolfsbane. Genosha was also shown to have typical suburban tract housing, like many small towns in America, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.<ref>\"X-Factor\" Vol. 1 #89. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAfter the \"[[Age of Apocalypse]]\" story arc, it was revealed and [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] that the mutate process formula was given to the Genegineer by [[Sugar Man]], a refugee of the ''Age of Apocalypse'' timeline.{{Issue|date=September 2010}}\n\nThe [[United Nations]] ceded the island nation to the powerful mutant [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], after he demanded an entire mutants-only nation.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #87 (Apr 1999)</ref><ref name=\"mnyc\">{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 49\u201351 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-4165-3141-6}}</ref> Magneto and his Acolytes managed to reestablish a modicum of peace and stability only briefly until civil war broke out between him and the remaining human population on the island led by the Magistrates. Magneto eventually defeated the Magistrates and restored order to most of the island, with hold-outs briefly remaining at Carrion Cove before being obliterated.\n\nThe elimination of the [[Legacy Virus]] gave Magneto a freshly healthy army, leading him to declare a campaign of global conquest.{{Issue|date=September 2010}} A small team of X-Men stopped this plan, badly injuring Magneto in the process<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #113, p.21. Marvel Comics.</ref> (the original issue presented him as being killed, but this was retconned in the ''[[New X-Men]]'' comic book series{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}).\n\nGenosha had a population of sixteen million mutants and a stable, advanced society.<ref>''New X-Men'' #115. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, the entire island was reduced to rubble and its mutant population was slain by [[Cassandra Nova]]'s Wild [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]]. There were few survivors, many evacuated, and the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] turned one of the Sentinels into a memorial statue.<ref>''New X-Men'' #132. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Xavier's leadership===\nMagneto and Xavier have since then joined forces to rebuild the island nation as detailed in the series ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' vol. 3 (2004). This goes badly as foreign military forces have thrown up a cordon around the island; no one is allowed to enter, and those trying to leave are fired upon.\n\nA few survivors and newly arriving mutants who wish to help with the rebuilding process remain on the island. Members of this volunteer 'army' include [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]], [[Freakshow (comics)|Freakshow]] and [[Wicked (comics)|Wicked]]. More are found in the surrounding countryside, some join with Xavier. There is a conflict with Magistrates, the island's former law enforcement. Though they are assisted by humanoid creatures they refer to as 'trolls', the Magistrates' forces are driven off. Some of the Magistrates are captured and kept in the island's makeshift jail.\n\nSome of the captured Magistrates agree to work with Xavier to rebuild the island. Throughout the entire series, [[Unus the Untouchable]] and his squadron of mutants remain a problem; they do not wish to be part of Xavier's group.<ref>''Excalibur'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===House of M===\n{{Main|House of M}}\nLater, Magneto learned of his daughter the Scarlet Witch's nervous break-down and her ever-growing powers to alter reality. Magneto snatched Wanda from her battle with her fellow Avengers and brought her to Genosha, where he asked Xavier to restore the Scarlet Witch\u2019s sanity - but to no avail. The telepath couldn\u2019t help her and, concerned of the threat to reality that Wanda posed, Xavier consulted the Avengers and the X-Men about what to do with her. Their decision was rendered moot, though, as by the time they reached Genosha reality altered around the heroes - changing into the world ruled by the \"[[House of M]]\".\n\nWhile conventional reality was eventually restored, it came at a high price, as thousands if not millions of Earth\u2019s mutant population lost their powers or died in the process, leaving only a few hundred mutants alive and powered. Just like most of his new Genoshan allies and enemies, Magneto was among the depowered people, remaining trapped on the island.\n\n===Son of M and the Collective Incident===\nIn the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] \"[[Son of M]],\" there is a battle between some of the remaining mutants and the [[Inhumans]].\n\nIn [[The New Avengers (comics)|''New Avengers'']] #19-20 it was stated that energy cannot be created nor destroyed, and the same held true for the energies of the numerous depowered mutants. Eventually, these energies gathered in the form of an unsuspecting energy-absorbing mutant named [[Michael Pointer (comics)|Michael Pointer]]. Dubbed \"the Collective\" by the Avengers, against whom he then fought, the Collective traveled to Genosha and reached out to the startled Magneto. The Collective, controlled by [[Xorn]], attempted to restore Magneto\u2019s powers and convince him to lead the remaining mutants into taking over the planet. To the Collective\u2019s surprise, Magneto resisted and allowed the Avengers to separate the energy from his body and send it into the sun. The comatose Magneto is also taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, but the helicopter that was supposed to transport him off Genosha explodes once it lifts off. Magneto\u2019s body is not found. It has since been revealed that he survived the explosion and remained depowered until the [[High Evolutionary]]'s dangerous experiment returned his magnetic abilities.<ref>''New Avengers'' #19-20. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Silent War===\n{{Main|Silent War}}\nTo date Genosha is now completely dead. Already in ruins before, the battle between the Inhumans and the O*N*E further destroyed the once-proud island nation.\n\nSince Magneto was the last person on Genosha, it seems that it\u2019s now totally uninhabited, which is corroborated by [[Wiccan (comics)|Wiccan]] and [[Speed (comics)|Speed]] when they began their search for their mother, the [[Scarlet Witch]]. They encountered Genosha an empty land filled with destroyed towers and empty streets.\n\n===Necrosha and beyond===\n{{Main|Necrosha}}\n[[Selene (comics)|Selene]] is seen traveling to the ruined island of Genosha with her followers who were resurrected by the Technarch transmode virus. Led there by [[Blink (comics)|Blink]] and [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]], who tells Selene he senses millions of dead mutants. They enter the ruins and Selene proclaims Hammer Bay, the devastated capital of the island nation Necrosha, the place where she will become a god.<ref>''X-Necrosha'' #1.

By the 1930s, Genosha Bay later became a United States extraterritorial prison which hold prisoners of the worse cases from around the world and was notorious for practicing [[inhumane punishment]]s on its prisoners ranging from sleep deprivations and water torture. Genosha Bay Prison caught the notice of the public and culminating in a Senate Judiciary Meeting on consider closing the prison.

Mutants were recently reduced to [[second-class citizen]]s after the murder of a government minister Lord Joseph Scheele by a mutant called [[Longshot (Marvel Comics)|Arthur Centino aka Longshot]] after an affair was revealed between Scheele and his girlfriend [[Spiral (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Spiral]].

However, as soon as mutants travel there, they are captured and fitted with power-negating collars placed around their necks; they are put to work building [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]] for the Genoshan government, under the direction of [[Bolivar Trask]], [[Cameron Hodge]], [[Henry Peter Gyrich]], and a government official known as \"the Leader.\" With the help of [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and a flood orchestrated by Storm, the X-Men simultaneously free the mutant slaves and destroy the Sentinels. Genosha continues to enslave mutants employing Sentinels and Magistrates, until they are rescued by Magneto and his Acolytes with the aid of many mutants (examples being [[Random (comics)|Random]], [[Arclight (comics)|Arclight]], [[Tar Baby (comics)|Tar Baby]], [[Blockbuster (Marvel Comics)|Blockbuster]], [[Peepers (Marvel Comics)|Peepers]], the second [[Randall Darby|Shocker]], and even [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]], the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] and [[Professor X]]). All Genoshan mutants leave for [[Asteroid M]]. Before long, the country is taken over by Magneto who is ready to declare war on humanity with the Genoshan mutants by his side, following an attack on Professor X during an anti-mutant summit. He never follows through with his plans though as he is called to a dying Xavier's side in the series' final episode.\n\n* In the ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' continuity, Genosha is a mutant paradise under Magneto's rule. Magneto offers the country as a sanctuary for other mutants around the world, promising peace and equality. Despite the facade of a mutant paradise, [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] (who intends on becoming a Genoshan resident) soon learns from [[Dust (comics)|Dust]] that Magneto is an oppressive ruler who [[incarceration|unfairly incarcerates]] Genosha mutants who do not abide by his rules. In \"Battle Lines,\" it is revealed that Senator Kelly gave Genosha to Magneto. In \"Aces and Eights\", Genosha has closed off its borders. This same episode continually present Genosha as a monarchy by depicted Magneto as a King. In the three-part episode \"Foresight,\" Magneto has Mystique pose as Senator Kelly and unleash the Sentinels on Genosha. This was part of Magneto's plan to reprogram them to attack humans only to face problems with the Phoenix Force. After the Phoenix Force is stopped, many of Magneto's followers have lost faith in his methods. Scarlet Witch and Polaris have Blink teleport Magneto and Quicksilver away from Genosha. Though Genosha is no longer Magneto's country, Scarlet Witch tells Quicksilver that he is always welcome to return.\n\n===Film===\nGenosha appears in both ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' and ''[[Dark Phoenix (film)|Dark Phoenix]]''. In ''X-Men'', it is an uncharted island serving as Magneto's Brotherhood base. In ''Dark Phoenix'', it is Magneto's safe haven for mutants (such as [[Red Lotus (comics)|Red Lotus/Ariki]] and [[Selene (comics)|Selene Gaillo]]) with no home to return to gifted to him by the [[U.S. Government]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/x-men-dark-phoenix-magneto-genosha/|title=How Magneto Fits Into X-Men: Dark Phoenix; Genosha Confirmed|last=Bacon|first=Thomas|website=Screen Rant|date=December 8, 2017|accessdate=January 14, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171209035925/https://screenrant.com/x-men-dark-phoenix-magneto-genosha/|archivedate=December 9, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Video games===\n* In the [[SNES]] game, [[Spider-Man and the X-Men in Arcade's Revenge]], Cyclops's levels are the Genosha Sentinel mines. \n* In the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] game, [[X-Men: Mutant Apocalypse]], Genosha serves as the primary setting of the game, as [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], [[Tusk (comics)|Tusk]], and the [[Brood (comics)|Broods]] take over said island to keep mutants in captivity.\n* Genosha is the Sentinel's stage in the arcade and console-imported game ''[[X-Men: Children of the Atom (arcade game)|X-Men: Children of the Atom]]''.

It is an island nation that exists in Marvel's main [[shared universe]], known as \"Earth 616\" in the [[Marvel Universe]] and a prominent place in the [[X-Men]] chronology. The fictional nation served as an [[allegory]] for [[slavery]] and later for [[South Africa]]n [[apartheid]] before becoming a mutant [[homeland]] and subsequently a disaster zone.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} The island is located off the Southeastern African coast northwest from [[Seychelles]] and northeast of [[Madagascar]]. Its capital city was Hammer Bay.\n\n==Publication history==\nGenosha first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #235 (October 1988), and was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Rick Leonardi]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=148}}</ref>\n\nGenosha received an entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89]]'' #3.\n\n==Fictional country history==\n\n===Mutant apartheid===\nThe island is located off the east coast of [[Africa]], to the north of [[Madagascar]], and boasted a high standard of living, an excellent economy, and freedom from the political and racial turmoil that characterized neighboring nations. However, Genosha's prosperity was built upon the enslavement of its [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] population. Mutants in Genosha were the property of the state and children who were positively identified with the mutant gene were put through a process developed by [[David Moreau]], commonly known as the Genegineer, stripped of free will and made into \"mutates\" (a Marvel term for genetically modified individuals, as opposed to those who developed mutant powers naturally). The Genegineer was also capable of modifying certain mutant abilities in order to fulfill specific labor shortages. Citizenship in Genosha is permanent and the government does not recognize any emigration. Citizens who attempt to leave the country are tracked down and forcibly brought back to the island by the special force known as [[Press Gang (comics)|Press Gang]]. The Press Gang consisted of Hawkshaw, Pipeline, and Punchout, and were aided in their task by [[Wipeout (comics)|Wipeout]]. Mutant problems are handled by a special group known as the [[Magistrates (comics)|Magistrates]]. The foundations of Genoshan society has been upset in recent years due to the efforts of outside mutant interests. In the first storyline to feature the nation, some members of the [[X-Men]] ([[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], and their ally [[Madelyne Pryor]]) were kidnapped by Genoshan Magistrates, under the order of the Genegineer.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #235-238. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later, in the multi-issue, multi-title ''[[X-Tinction Agenda]]'' storyline, the X-Men and their allies rescued their teammates, [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Tabitha Smith|Meltdown]], [[Rictor]] and [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]], from Genoshan brainwashing, toppling the government after discovering their alliance with former [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] ally turned mutant hater, [[Cameron Hodge]], and that [[Havok (comics)|Havok]] was one of the Magistrates since having his memory wiped by the Siege Perilous. Havok himself, woken from his conditioning by his brother [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] dealt the killing blow to Cameron Hodge in the process.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men '' #270-272, ''New Mutants'' #95-97, ''X-Factor'' #60-62. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Conflict and Magneto's reign===\nA new Genoshan regime that promised better treatment of mutants was put in place after Hodge's destruction. A period of general turmoil and a number of attacks by superhumans, including [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]'s [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]] who were unwilling to forgive the former Genoshan government for its crimes against mutants, followed.{{Issue|date=September 2010}}\n\nA different version of X-Factor, including Wolfsbane, later returned to the island to help restore peace between its government and a rogue group of super-powered beings that had fled the island. The Genoshan government was shown with peaceful intentions, even trying to undo the ill effects visited upon Wolfsbane. Genosha was also shown to have typical suburban tract housing, like many small towns in America, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.<ref>\"X-Factor\" Vol. 1 #89. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAfter the \"[[Age of Apocalypse]]\" story arc, it was revealed and [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] that the mutate process formula was given to the Genegineer by [[Sugar Man]], a refugee of the ''Age of Apocalypse'' timeline.{{Issue|date=September 2010}}\n\nThe [[United Nations]] ceded the island nation to the powerful mutant [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], after he demanded an entire mutants-only nation.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #87 (Apr 1999)</ref><ref name=\"mnyc\">{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 49\u201351 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-4165-3141-6}}</ref> Magneto and his Acolytes managed to reestablish a modicum of peace and stability only briefly until civil war broke out between him and the remaining human population on the island led by the Magistrates. Magneto eventually defeated the Magistrates and restored order to most of the island, with hold-outs briefly remaining at Carrion Cove before being obliterated.\n\nThe elimination of the [[Legacy Virus]] gave Magneto a freshly healthy army, leading him to declare a campaign of global conquest.{{Issue|date=September 2010}} A small team of X-Men stopped this plan, badly injuring Magneto in the process<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #113, p.21. Marvel Comics.</ref> (the original issue presented him as being killed, but this was retconned in the ''[[New X-Men]]'' comic book series{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}).\n\nGenosha had a population of sixteen million mutants and a stable, advanced society.<ref>''New X-Men'' #115. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, the entire island was reduced to rubble and its mutant population was slain by [[Cassandra Nova]]'s Wild [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]]. There were few survivors, many evacuated, and the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] turned one of the Sentinels into a memorial statue.<ref>''New X-Men'' #132. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Xavier's leadership===\nMagneto and Xavier have since then joined forces to rebuild the island nation as detailed in the series ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' vol. 3 (2004). This goes badly as foreign military forces have thrown up a cordon around the island; no one is allowed to enter, and those trying to leave are fired upon.\n\nA few survivors and newly arriving mutants who wish to help with the rebuilding process remain on the island. Members of this volunteer 'army' include [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]], [[Freakshow (comics)|Freakshow]] and [[Wicked (comics)|Wicked]]. More are found in the surrounding countryside, some join with Xavier. There is a conflict with Magistrates, the island's former law enforcement. Though they are assisted by humanoid creatures they refer to as 'trolls', the Magistrates' forces are driven off. Some of the Magistrates are captured and kept in the island's makeshift jail.\n\nSome of the captured Magistrates agree to work with Xavier to rebuild the island. Throughout the entire series, [[Unus the Untouchable]] and his squadron of mutants remain a problem; they do not wish to be part of Xavier's group.<ref>''Excalibur'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===House of M===\n{{Main|House of M}}\nLater, Magneto learned of his daughter the Scarlet Witch's nervous break-down and her ever-growing powers to alter reality. Magneto snatched Wanda from her battle with her fellow Avengers and brought her to Genosha, where he asked Xavier to restore the Scarlet Witch\u2019s sanity - but to no avail. The telepath couldn\u2019t help her and, concerned of the threat to reality that Wanda posed, Xavier consulted the Avengers and the X-Men about what to do with her. Their decision was rendered moot, though, as by the time they reached Genosha reality altered around the heroes - changing into the world ruled by the \"[[House of M]]\".\n\nWhile conventional reality was eventually restored, it came at a high price, as thousands if not millions of Earth\u2019s mutant population lost their powers or died in the process, leaving only a few hundred mutants alive and powered. Just like most of his new Genoshan allies and enemies, Magneto was among the depowered people, remaining trapped on the island.\n\n===Son of M and the Collective Incident===\nIn the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] \"[[Son of M]],\" there is a battle between some of the remaining mutants and the [[Inhumans]].\n\nIn [[The New Avengers (comics)|''New Avengers'']] #19-20 it was stated that energy cannot be created nor destroyed, and the same held true for the energies of the numerous depowered mutants. Eventually, these energies gathered in the form of an unsuspecting energy-absorbing mutant named [[Michael Pointer (comics)|Michael Pointer]]. Dubbed \"the Collective\" by the Avengers, against whom he then fought, the Collective traveled to Genosha and reached out to the startled Magneto. The Collective, controlled by [[Xorn]], attempted to restore Magneto\u2019s powers and convince him to lead the remaining mutants into taking over the planet. To the Collective\u2019s surprise, Magneto resisted and allowed the Avengers to separate the energy from his body and send it into the sun. The comatose Magneto is also taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, but the helicopter that was supposed to transport him off Genosha explodes once it lifts off. Magneto\u2019s body is not found. It has since been revealed that he survived the explosion and remained depowered until the [[High Evolutionary]]'s dangerous experiment returned his magnetic abilities.<ref>''New Avengers'' #19-20. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Silent War===\n{{Main|Silent War}}\nTo date Genosha is now completely dead. Already in ruins before, the battle between the Inhumans and the O*N*E further destroyed the once-proud island nation.\n\nSince Magneto was the last person on Genosha, it seems that it\u2019s now totally uninhabited, which is corroborated by [[Wiccan (comics)|Wiccan]] and [[Speed (comics)|Speed]] when they began their search for their mother, the [[Scarlet Witch]]. They encountered Genosha an empty land filled with destroyed towers and empty streets.\n\n===Necrosha and beyond===\n{{Main|Necrosha}}\n[[Selene (comics)|Selene]] is seen traveling to the ruined island of Genosha with her followers who were resurrected by the Technarch transmode virus. Led there by [[Blink (comics)|Blink]] and [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]], who tells Selene he senses millions of dead mutants.

Marvel Comics.</ref> and returning Genosha to an empty land. According to writer Chris Yost, Elixir is still on Necrosha.\n\nDuring a visit to Genosha by the students of Jean Grey's School for Gifted Youngsters' students organized by Beast and Kitty Pryde, Sabretooth and AOA Blob assaulted Kid Gladiator and Kid Omega in order to kidnap Genesis.

The island returns in an arc of ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' where the mutant killer [[Alternative_versions_of_Deadpool#Ultimate_Marvel|Deadpool]] and his [[Reavers (comics)|squad]] is hired by Adams. <ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' Vol 1 91-93</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* In the 1990s animated TV series ''[[X-Men (1992 TV series)|X-Men]]'', Genosha claims to be a mutant-friendly environment where those possessing the \"X-gene\" could live peacefully without fear of persecution. However, as soon as mutants travel there, they are captured and fitted with power-negating collars placed around their necks; they are put to work building [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]] for the Genoshan government, under the direction of [[Bolivar Trask]], [[Cameron Hodge]], [[Henry Peter Gyrich]], and a government official known as \"the Leader.\" With the help of [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and a flood orchestrated by Storm, the X-Men simultaneously free the mutant slaves and destroy the Sentinels. Genosha continues to enslave mutants employing Sentinels and Magistrates, until they are rescued by Magneto and his Acolytes with the aid of many mutants (examples being [[Random (comics)|Random]], [[Arclight (comics)|Arclight]], [[Tar Baby (comics)|Tar Baby]], [[Blockbuster (Marvel Comics)|Blockbuster]], [[Peepers (Marvel Comics)|Peepers]], the second [[Randall Darby|Shocker]], and even [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]], the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] and [[Professor X]]). All Genoshan mutants leave for [[Asteroid M]]. Before long, the country is taken over by Magneto who is ready to declare war on humanity with the Genoshan mutants by his side, following an attack on Professor X during an anti-mutant summit. He never follows through with his plans though as he is called to a dying Xavier's side in the series' final episode.\n\n* In the ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' continuity, Genosha is a mutant paradise under Magneto's rule. Magneto offers the country as a sanctuary for other mutants around the world, promising peace and equality. Despite the facade of a mutant paradise, [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] (who intends on becoming a Genoshan resident) soon learns from [[Dust (comics)|Dust]] that Magneto is an oppressive ruler who [[incarceration|unfairly incarcerates]] Genosha mutants who do not abide by his rules. In \"Battle Lines,\" it is revealed that Senator Kelly gave Genosha to Magneto. In \"Aces and Eights\", Genosha has closed off its borders. This same episode continually present Genosha as a monarchy by depicted Magneto as a King. In the three-part episode \"Foresight,\" Magneto has Mystique pose as Senator Kelly and unleash the Sentinels on Genosha. This was part of Magneto's plan to reprogram them to attack humans only to face problems with the Phoenix Force. After the Phoenix Force is stopped, many of Magneto's followers have lost faith in his methods. Scarlet Witch and Polaris have Blink teleport Magneto and Quicksilver away from Genosha. Though Genosha is no longer Magneto's country, Scarlet Witch tells Quicksilver that he is always welcome to return.\n\n===Film===\nGenosha appears in both ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' and ''[[Dark Phoenix (film)|Dark Phoenix]]''. In ''X-Men'', it is an uncharted island serving as Magneto's Brotherhood base. In ''Dark Phoenix'', it is Magneto's safe haven for mutants (such as [[Red Lotus (comics)|Red Lotus/Ariki]] and [[Selene (comics)|Selene Gaillo]]) with no home to return to gifted to him by the [[U.S. Government]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/x-men-dark-phoenix-magneto-genosha/|title=How Magneto Fits Into X-Men: Dark Phoenix; Genosha Confirmed|last=Bacon|first=Thomas|website=Screen Rant|date=December 8, 2017|accessdate=January 14, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171209035925/https://screenrant.com/x-men-dark-phoenix-magneto-genosha/|archivedate=December 9, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Video games===\n* In the [[SNES]] game, [[Spider-Man and the X-Men in Arcade's Revenge]], Cyclops's levels are the Genosha Sentinel mines. \n* In the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] game, [[X-Men: Mutant Apocalypse]], Genosha serves as the primary setting of the game, as [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], [[Tusk (comics)|Tusk]], and the [[Brood (comics)|Broods]] take over said island to keep mutants in captivity.\n* Genosha is the Sentinel's stage in the arcade and console-imported game ''[[X-Men: Children of the Atom (arcade game)|X-Men: Children of the Atom]]''.
