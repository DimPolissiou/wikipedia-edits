Fossils of ''Slimonia'' have been discovered in deposits of [[Silurian]] age in [[South America]] and [[Europe]]. Classified as part of the family [[Slimonidae]] alongside the related ''[[Salteropterus]]'', the genus contains three valid species, ''S. acuminata'' from [[Lesmahagow]], [[Scotland]], ''S. boliviana'' from [[Cochabamba]], [[Bolivia]] and ''S. dubia'' from the [[Pentland Hills]] of [[Scotland]] and one [[Nomen dubium|dubious]] species, ''S. stylops'', from [[Herefordshire]], [[England]]. The generic name is derived from and honors Robert Slimon, a fossil collector and surgeon from Lesmahagow.\n\nOut of the four described species of ''Slimonia'', three measured below or up to {{convert|20|cm|in}} in length. Only ''S. acuminata'' was larger, with the largest specimens measuring {{convert|100|cm|in}} in length. Though this is large for a predatory arthropod, ''Slimonia'' would be exceeded in length by later and more [[Derived trait|derived]] (more \"advanced\") members of the closely related [[Pterygotidae|pterygotid]] family of eurypterids, which would become the largest known arthropods to ever live.\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Slimonia_acuminata_reconstruction.jpg|left|thumb|Life restoration of ''S. acuminata'']]\n''Slimonia'' is in many ways similar to the more [[Derived trait|derived]] (more \"advanced\") eurypterids of its superfamily, the [[Pterygotioidea]]. In particular, the expanded and flattened telson (the most posterior segment of the body) of ''Slimonia'' is similar to that of the [[Pterygotidae|pterygotid]] eurypterids and is a feature that ''Slimonia'' and the pterygotids only share with some derived [[Hibbertopteridae|hibbertopterid]] eurypterids (where the feature convergently evolved).<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Plotnick|first=Roy E.|last2=Baumiller|first2=Tomasz K.|date=1988-01-01|title=The pterygotid telson as a biological rudder|journal=Lethaia|language=en|volume=21|issue=1|pages=13\u201327|doi=10.1111/j.1502-3931.1988.tb01746.x|issn=1502-3931}}</ref> The pterygotid telson was in general slightly larger than that of ''Slimonia'' and was more slender.

Named ''S. boliviana'', the [[holotype]] (BLV15, deposited at the [[National Museum of Natural History (France)|National Museum of Natural History of France]]) comprises a well-preserved telson typical of the genus, being laterally inflated and with a dagger-like terminal point. It was anteriorly covered with small scales semilunar to mucronitic (\"spined\") grouped into a single row of large marginal scales that form a linear serrated edge. A slight dorsal keel is present along the telson. There was a triangular area at the base of the telson which could have been a point of union with the muscles. ''S. boliviana'' differed from ''S. acuminata'' in having the keel much less developed, narrower and not reaching the terminal spike. The latter was wider, not as pointed and with less developed serrations. The telson itself was wider and shorter than in the type species.

The specimen might have experienced some disarticulation postmortem (or could represent a partial exuviae), but as there is no apparent disarticulation in the metasoma, it is likely that the articulation seen in the postabdominal segments would have been possible in life (which is also seen in some other eurypterid fossils, such as of ''[[Eurypterus]]'' and ''[[Alkenopterus]]'').<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nBiomechanical studies on the telsons and postabdominal segments of closely related eurypterids, particularly those of the family [[Pterygotidae]], has revealed that the body was very stiff, and that the flattened telson would likely have served a function as a rudder that would have allowed the animals to be agile and capable of quick turns when chasing after prey, contradicting previous hypotheses that they would have served a propulsive function.<ref name=\":1\" /> Whilst the postabdomen of ''Slimonia'' was likely similarly stiff and inflexible dorsally (up and down), the study of the specimen suggests that it was highly flexible laterally (side to side). As such, it has been theorised that the tail may have been used as a weapon. The telson spine, serrated along the sides and exceeding the flattened telson in length, ends in a sharp tip and it was proposed that it could have been capable of piercing prey.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/killer-tail-spine-likely-helped-ancient-sea-scorpion-subdue-its-prey|title=A killer tail spine likely helped this ancient sea scorpion subdue its prey|date=2017-04-17|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|access-date=2018-03-18|language=en}}</ref>\n\nHowever, this particularly theory was later criticized and disproved. Even though the original study claimed that the fossil didn't show any signs of disarticulation, this is likely not true. It can be clearly seen that both tergite 8 and 10 overlap the other tergites in an unnatural way. Furthermore, it was noted that the specimen was not a carcass, rather a molt. This would mean that the pose the fossil was in does not represent a possible life position. The telson of ''Slimonia'' also possesses a keel, which would have created significant drag while trying to stab its prey. Lastly, the serrations on the telson would most likely be attachment points for setae and would have aided the animal in sensing the water flow. This made steering much more easier.<ref name=\":23\" />\n\n[[Visual acuity]], the clarity of vision, can be determined in arthropods by determining number of lenses in their [[compound eyes]] and the interommatidial angle (shortened as IOA and referring to the angle between the optical axes of the adjacent lenses).

If the pustules had setae, the gracile second pair of appendages of ''S. acuminata'' may have functioned as tactile and sensory organs used for locating and identifying prey, together with the [[pedipalp]]s (the second pair of appendages).<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261064695|title=A collection of eurypterids from the Silurian of Lesmahagow collected pre 1900|journal=Geological Curator|last=Lomax|first=Dean|last2=Lamsdell|first2=James|last3=Ciurca|first3=Samuel|date=2011-01-01|volume=9|pages=331\u2013348}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Paleontology}}\n* [[List of eurypterid genera]]\n* [[Timeline of eurypterid research]]\n\n{{clearboth}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Eurypterida}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q1448323}}\n\n[[Category:Pterygotioidea]]\n[[Category:Silurian eurypterids]]\n[[Category:Silurian first appearances]]\n[[Category:Silurian extinctions]]\n[[Category:Eurypterids of Europe]]\n[[Category:Silurian United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Fossils of England]]\n[[Category:Fossils of Scotland]]\n[[Category:Eurypterids of South America]]\n[[Category:Silurian Bolivia]]\n[[Category:Fossils of Bolivia]]\n[[Category:Fossil taxa described in 1856]]\n", "text_old": "{{good article}}\n{{Italic title}}\n{{Automatic taxobox\n| display_parents = 2\n| taxon = Slimonia\n| authority = Page, 1856\n| fossil_range = [[Silurian]], {{Fossil range|436|420}}\n| image = Slimonia acuminata 1.jpg\n| image_caption = Fossil of ''S. acuminata'' housed at the [[Naturmuseum Senckenberg|Senckenberg Museum of Frankfurt]]\n| type_species = \u2020'''''Slimonia acuminata'''''\n| type_species_authority = Salter, 1856\n| subdivision_ranks = Species\n| subdivision = *\u2020'''''S. acuminata''''' <small>Salter, 1856</small>\n*\u2020'''''S. boliviana''''' <small>Kjellesvig-Waering, 1973</small>\n*\u2020'''''S. dubia''''' <small>Laurie, 1899</small>\n*\u2020?'''''S. stylops''''' <small>Salter, 1859</small>\n}}\n\n'''''Slimonia''''' is a genus of [[eurypterid]], an extinct group of aquatic [[arthropod]]s. Fossils of ''Slimonia'' have been discovered in deposits of [[Silurian]] age in [[South America]] and [[Europe]]. Classified as part of the family [[Slimonidae]] alongside the related ''[[Salteropterus]]'', the genus contains three valid species, ''S. acuminata'' from [[Lesmahagow]], [[Scotland]], ''S. boliviana'' from [[Cochabamba]], [[Bolivia]] and ''S. dubia'' from the [[Pentland Hills]] of [[Scotland]] and one [[Nomen dubium|dubious]] species, ''S. stylops'', from [[Herefordshire]], [[England]]. The generic name is derived from and honors Robert Slimon, a fossil collector and surgeon from Lesmahagow.\n\nOut of the four described species of ''Slimonia'', three measured below or up to {{convert|20|cm|in}} in length. Only ''S. acuminata'' was larger, with the largest specimens measuring {{convert|100|cm|in}} in length. Though this is large for a predatory arthropod, ''Slimonia'' would be exceeded in length by later and more [[Derived trait|derived]] (more \"advanced\") members of the closely related [[Pterygotidae|pterygotid]] family of eurypterids, which would become the largest known arthropods to ever live.\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Slimonia_acuminata_reconstruction.jpg|left|thumb|Life restoration of ''S. acuminata'']]\n''Slimonia'' is in many ways similar to the more [[Derived trait|derived]] (more \"advanced\") eurypterids of its superfamily, the [[Pterygotioidea]]. In particular, the expanded and flattened telson (the most posterior segment of the body) of ''Slimonia'' is similar to that of the [[Pterygotidae|pterygotid]] eurypterids and is a feature that ''Slimonia'' and the pterygotids only share with some derived [[Hibbertopteridae|hibbertopterid]] eurypterids (where the feature convergently evolved).<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Plotnick|first=Roy E.|last2=Baumiller|first2=Tomasz K.|date=1988-01-01|title=The pterygotid telson as a biological rudder|journal=Lethaia|language=en|volume=21|issue=1|pages=13\u201327|doi=10.1111/j.1502-3931.1988.tb01746.x|issn=1502-3931}}</ref> The pterygotid telson was in general slightly larger than that of ''Slimonia'' and was more slender.

Named ''S. boliviana'', the [[holotype]] (BLV15, deposited at the [[National Museum of Natural History (France)|National Museum of Natural History of France]]) comprises a well-preserved telson typical of the genus, being laterally inflated and with a dagger-like terminal point. It was anteriorly covered with small scales semilunar to mucronitic (\"spined\") grouped into a single row of large marginal scales that form a linear serrated edge. A slight dorsal keel is present along the telson. There was a triangular area at the base of the telson which could have been a point of union with the muscles. ''S. boliviana'' differed from ''S. acuminata'' in having the keel much less developed, narrower and not reaching the terminal spike. The latter was wider, not as pointed and with less developed serrations. The telson itself was wider and shorter than in the type species.

The specimen might have experienced some disarticulation postmortem (or could represent a partial exuviae), but as there is no apparent disarticulation in the metasoma, it is likely that the articulation seen in the postabdominal segments would have been possible in life (which is also seen in some other eurypterid fossils, such as of ''[[Eurypterus]]'' and ''[[Alkenopterus]]'').<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nBiomechanical studies on the telsons and postabdominal segments of closely related eurypterids, particularly those of the [[Pterygotidae]] family, has revealed that the body was very stiff, and that the flattened telson would likely have served a function as a rudder that would have allowed the animals to be agile and capable of quick turns when chasing after prey, contradicting previous hypotheses that they would have served a propulsive function.<ref name=\":1\" /> Whilst the postabdomen of ''Slimonia'' was likely similarly stiff and inflexible dorsally (up and down), the study of the specimen suggests that it was highly flexible laterally (side to side). As such, it has been theorised that the tail may have been used as a weapon. The telson spine, serrated along the sides and exceeding the flattened telson in length, ends in a sharp tip and it was proposed that it could have been capable of piercing prey.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/killer-tail-spine-likely-helped-ancient-sea-scorpion-subdue-its-prey|title=A killer tail spine likely helped this ancient sea scorpion subdue its prey|date=2017-04-17|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|access-date=2018-03-18|language=en}}</ref>\n\nHowever, this particularly theory was later criticized and disproved. Even though the original study claimed that the fossil didn't show any signs of disarticulation, this is likely not true. It can be clearly seen that both tergite 8 and 10 overlap the other tergites in an unnatural way. Furthermore, it was noted that the specimen was not a carcass, rather a molt. This would mean that the pose the fossil was in does not represent a possible life position. The telson of ''Slimonia'' also possesses a keel, which would have created significant drag while trying to stab its prey. Lastly, the serrations on the telson would most likely be attachment points for setae and would have aided the animal in sensing the water flow. This made steering much more easier.<ref name=\":23\" />\n\n[[Visual acuity]], the clarity of vision, can be determined in arthropods by determining number of lenses in their [[compound eyes]] and the interommatidial angle (shortened as IOA and referring to the angle between the optical axes of the adjacent lenses).

If the pustules had setae, the gracile second pair of appendages of ''S. acuminata'' may have functioned as tactile and sensory organs used for locating and identifying prey, together with the [[pedipalp]]s (the second pair of appendages).<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261064695|title=A collection of eurypterids from the Silurian of Lesmahagow collected pre 1900|journal=Geological Curator|last=Lomax|first=Dean|last2=Lamsdell|first2=James|last3=Ciurca|first3=Samuel|date=2011-01-01|volume=9|pages=331\u2013348}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Paleontology}}\n* [[List of eurypterid genera]]\n* [[Timeline of eurypterid research]]\n\n{{clearboth}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Eurypterida}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q1448323}}\n\n[[Category:Pterygotioidea]]\n[[Category:Silurian eurypterids]]\n[[Category:Silurian first appearances]]\n[[Category:Silurian extinctions]]\n[[Category:Eurypterids of Europe]]\n[[Category:Silurian United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Fossils of England]]\n[[Category:Fossils of Scotland]]\n[[Category:Eurypterids of South America]]\n[[Category:Silurian Bolivia]]\n[[Category:Fossils of Bolivia]]\n[[Category:Fossil taxa described in 1856]]\n", "name_user": "WolfmanSF", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slimonia"}

Ailbhe protected the wolf and thereafter fed her and her cubs every day from his hall.<ref name=thurston/>   Ailbe was discovered in the forest by visiting Britons: these British foster-parents were said to have planned to leave him in Ireland when they returned home but were constantly and miraculously unable to make the passage until they consented to take him with them.<ref name=answer/>  They then took Ailbe with them when they returned to Wales (''Vita Albei'' 2).\n\nA tradition also going back to the earliest ''Vita'' (''Vita Albei'' 9) held that he went to Rome and was ordained as a bishop by  [[Pope Hilary|Saint Hilary]] who was then [[list of popes|pope]]. Upon being ordained in Rome, he was said to have fed the people of the city for three days before returning home.<ref name=answer/> At the end of his life, a supernatural ship came and he boarded to learn the secret of his death.

The year of his death \u2013 528 - that is recorded in the  'Annals of Innisfallen' (compiled at Emly probably in 1092),<ref>Se\u00e1n Mac Airt, ed. & trans, \"The Annals of Inisfallen\", Dublin 1944   ('The Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies' 1951, reprinted  1988)</ref> is not, however, compatible with a 'pre-Patrician' career.

Thus the 16th c. ''Achau\u2019r Saint'' records \"''Eilvyw a Dirdan Saint Breudan''\" (variant : \"''Breudain''\") while a 16thc. Manuscript of  ''Bonedd y Saint''  records \"''Ailvyw vab Dirdan''\".

Amberley Publishing (Stroud), 2009.</ref> This genealogy is almost certainly fictitious but it may be significant that he was thought of as having a British origin, while the epithet ''Saint Breudan'' (if not for 'Brittany') might conceivably suggest some kind of special  symbolic link with 'Britain'.\n\nThat the connection with Saint David goes back a long way, in any case, is demonstrated by the fact that in the earliest Irish ''Vita'' (perhaps of the 8th c.)  an incident is described in which Ailbe prophesies that a pregnant woman will give birth to a famous bishop, David (''Vita Albei'' 21) That the links between Pembrokeshire and Ireland go back to the fifth century is well known, meanwhile. As Dagmar \u00d3 Riain-Raedel has noted, at that time \"the settlements of the ''D\u00e9isi'' and ''U\u00ed Liath\u00e1in'' of East Munster in South West Wales established an important link between Britain and Ireland\" and, one might add, specifically between Pembrokeshire (and so potentially 'Menevia' or Saint David's) and the Munster in which Emly may have been an early significant centre.\n\nAs noted above the earliest Irish Life records that Ailbe was taken by Britons from Ireland to Britain and could therefore be seen as coming (back) from there to Ireland before performing his missionary work.  Arguably this might have been a story invented to reconcile his Irish birth with an enduring tradition of his actual British origin\n\n==Possible pre-Christian origins==\nProfessor [[P\u00e1draig \u00d3 Riain]] suggests the cult of Saint Ailbe may have pre-Christian origins.<ref>Padraig O'Riain, s.v. Ailbe in \"Dictionary of Irish Biography\", Royal Irish Academy, Cambridge University Press\n[http://dib.cambridge.org/viewReadPage.do;jsessionid=E25DCB8854E9EEC37271373C13A8E36C?articleId=a0073]</ref>  The name ''Ailbe'' figures quite extensively in a context of Irish folk tale, with its likely origins mainly in pre-Christian pagan mythology. For instance ''Ailbe'' was the name of the 'divine hound'  in \"[[The Tale of Mac Da Th\u00f3's Pig]]\" <ref>trans. in Cross, T.P. and Slover, C.H. (1936) \"Ancient Irish Tales\", New York; pp. 68-76 in Koch, John T and Carey, John ed. 2003 \"The Celtic Heroic Age\", Celtic Studies Publications: Aberystwyth</ref> associated with the ''Mag Ailbe'' or 'plain of Ailbe',<ref>note 84 in Kenney J.F. (1929) \"Sources for the Early History of Ireland: Vol 1, Ecclesiastical\", Columbia (reprinted New York 1966)</ref> where stood a  ''Lia Ailbe'', or 'stone of Ailbe'.  The 'divine hound' ''Ailbe'' defended Leinster, the chief centre of which was ''Aillen'', whose female eponym, ''Aillen'', owned a marvellous lap dog ''Ailbe'', according to the  'Metrical [[Dindsenchas]]'.To these 'canine' associations one might compare the tradition which identified Ailbe\u2019s father as \u2018''Ol-chu''\u2019 (\u2018''Olcnais''\u2019 in ''Vita Albei'' 1), \u2018great-hound\u2019, as well as the (likely related) story of the infant Ailbe being cared for by a she-wolf\n\nAn \u2018''Ailbe Gr\u00faadbrecc''\u2019, meanwhile,was the daughter of ''[[Cormac mac Airt]]'' (premier mythical Irish king) and a wife (as her sister ''[[Gr\u00e1inne]]'') of ''Finn'' (= literally, \u2018white\u2019) or [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]] in the ''Tochmarc Ailbe'',<ref>p. 276 in O\u2019Rahilly, T,F.

An ''Ailbe'' was also daughter of ''[[Mider]]'', son of the ''[[Dagda]].'' <ref>Dooley, op.cit. p.15</ref>\n\n==The name \"Ailbe\"==\nThe name ''Ailbe'' was explained in the ''Vita Albei'' as derivative of ''ail'' 'a rock' and ''beo'', 'living'. In the words of Baring Gould and Fisher <ref>Baring-Gould and Fisher (1907), \"The Lives of the British Saints\" Vol I, p. 130 [https://archive.org/details/livesofbritishsa01bariuoft]</ref> this is \"a very doubtful  etymology\". It is clearly related to the story of his being exposed behind a rock after his birth, before being cared for by a wolf (''Vita Albei'' 2) <ref>Heist op.cit. 167-81; trans. De Paor op.cit pp. 227-43</ref>  and looks very much like a folk-etymology. \nNevertheless, we can note a sporadic association of Ailbe (as saint or mythological figure) with ' rocks' (Irish ''ail''). The ''Lia Ailbe'' (stone of Ailbe) on the ''Magh Ailbe'' (plain of Ailbe) may be in origin tautological, while a  ''Sliabh Ailbe'' was associated with a legendary figure ''Ailbe'' in ''Duanaire Finn''.<ref>II, 95, xlii in MacNeill, Eoin and Murphy, Gerard (1908-54) Duanaire Finn,  3 vols, Irish Texts Society 7, 28, 43.</ref>   The ''Inbher Ailbhine''   mentioned in Tirechan's ''Vita Patricii'' (''Tirechan'' 5.2)<ref>Bieler op.cit p. 127</ref>  may contain ''ail'', \u2018a rock\u2019, according to Watson.<ref>p. 469, note 1 in Watson, W.J.

This appears in Irish as ''Albe-'', ''Alpe-'' and ''Albu'', ''Alpu''.  There is, however, no obvious explanation for this name to appear in the form ''ailbe'' and the root  ''albi(i\u032d)o-'' would not take that form in Irish, according to the way that language normally developed.  The ''i'', in the  ''ai'' of ''Ailbe'', is not a full vowel but represents an audible \u2018glide\u2019 before a palatised ''l''.<ref>pp. 55-7, \u00a786 in Thurneysen, Rudolf (1946) \"A Grammar of Old Irish\", Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies</ref> This palatised ''l'', with ''i''-glide is not found in Irish ''Albu'', 'Britain'.\n\nAll of this renders the precise form of the name ''Ailbe'', in Irish, arguably, somewhat mysterious.\n\n==Interpretation as a localised version of the cult of Saint Alban==\nPhilip Thornhill <ref>Thornhill, Philip (2000) \"The Sub-Roman Cult of Saint Alban\" (\"St. Alban and the End of Roman Britain Part 1\")  in 'The Mankind Quarterly' 41, pp. 3-42. [http://www.unz.org/Pub/MankindQuarterly-2000q1-00003] (Revised Version [https://www.academia.edu/31861781/Saint_Alban_and_the_End_of_Roman_Britain_revised_version_])</ref> has argued that the Irish cult of Ailbe represents in origin a localised version of the cult of the British martyr [[Saint Alban]]. The latter is explained as being rooted  itself in pre-Christian religion or mythology but also as bearing some relation to [[Albion]] as the ancient name for Britain and  designed to serve as a symbol for the corporate identity of the Britons in the new Christian era. It will have been, according to this argument, to some extent a 're-invention' designed to serve a political purpose in unifying the Britons, probably under the dominance of ''[[Verulamium]]'' (the modern [[Saint Albans]]) where the cult of the martyr Alban was most probably based.\n\nCritical to the theory is the interpretation of the [[Elafius]] mentioned in the [[Vita Germani]], or Life of [[Germanus of Auxerre|Saint Germanus]], as a mis-hearing, in a garbled version of the story of Saint Germanus's visit to Britain, of the name ''Albios'' or ''Albius'', as an alternative name for ''Albanus'' \u2013 the latter possibly representing a later version of the name, perhaps introduced by Germanus. A Celtic ''Albios'' or vulgar Latin ''Albius'', pronounced in a British-Celtic way, would have given \u2013 so Thornhill argues \u2013 a name ''Ailbe'', if borrowed into Irish. The ''ei'' in the Welsh form (''Llan'')''eilfyw'' would be explained by the process of ''i''-assimilation, a feature of the development of the Brittonic Celtic languages  and a process which would have been underway by the 5th century.<ref>pp. in 260, 238-9, 247-8 Sims-Williams, Patrick (1990) \"Dating the Transition to Neo-Brittonic: Phonology and History, 400 to 600\" in  A Bammesberger, A. Wollman, ed., \"Britain 400 to 600: Language and History\",  Heidelberg: Winter; cf. pp. 558, 560-1 (lenition b to \u0180) & 579-618 (final i-affection) in  Jackson, Kenneth. H  (1953) \"Language and History in Early Britain\", Edinburgh.</ref> The change from ''a'' to ''ei'' by the effect of the following ''i'' (''i''-assimilation) would be typical of the North West (latterly Welsh) dialects of the ancient British language \u2013 and it is likely the cult would have spread from nearby Wales to Ireland. The ''l'' with ''i''-glide seen in Irish ''ailbe'' would have been the nearest Irish equivalent to the ''ei-'' in a Brittonic name  ''Eilbhios'' < ''Albios/us'' undergoing ''i''-assimilation.\n\nThornhill quotes [[Prosper of Aquitaine]]<ref>Prosper of Aquitaine, ''Prosperi Tironis Epitoma Chronicon'', in ''Monumenta Germaniae Historica'' (''MGH''), ''Chronica Minora'' vol 1, 1892,  Mommsen, Theodore, ed., Berlin: Weidemann pp. 385-485;  Migne, ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'' vol.51 [http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/30_10_0390-0463-_Prosperus_Aquitanus.html]; English trans. in \"From Roman to Merovingian Gaul: A Reader\" ed. & trans. A. C Murray (Ontario, 2003) pp. 62\u201376</ref> who reports the sending of Palladius (said in the ''Vita Albei'' to have baptised Ailbe) in 431, a few years after Germanus visited the cult centre of Saint Alban in Britain in 429.   \n \nFor the 'British connections' of the cult of saint Ailbe see above. It might be possible that the name was introduced by an actual (missionary) Briton named ''Albios/us'' but that would leave the occurrence of the name in early Irish literature and folk tale hard to explain. Thornhill argues that these medieval sources represent not only ancient pagan mythology but also syncretic influences that might have been at work from the 5th century onwards. The name Ailbe would have entered into the folk tradition through the displacement of an original pagan cult at Emly which it may have become identified with  and through the typical pagan-mythological, probably solar, associations of the root ''albho-'' which may have had their equivalent in Irish tradition. Thornhill points in particular to a likely assimilation to the pagan (probably solar) deity ''Aillil'' or ''Aillen'', connected  with the ''Ui Aillelo'' associated with the second saint 'Ailbe of Sencua', the warrior ''Aillil'' on whose chariot the head of the 'divine hound' ''Ailbhe'' ends up being impaled and  the female eponym of ''Aillen'', near the ''Mag Ailbhe'', whose marvellous lap-dog was called ''Ailbhe''. Thornhill suggests that a parallel assimilation occurred in Britain to the ''Al-'' of ''Alauna'' (a Celtic toponym and theonym) and related names, and that a typical outcome of this assimilation was  the element ''El-'' found in several Brittonic saints' names. He also compares the ''Navigatio'''s 'island of Ailbe' to the 'island of Britain' or ''Albion'' as (so he argues) associated with ''Albios/Albanus''.'Al = Rock[y]; Ban/Ben', 'means Mountain'\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:StAilbe'sCrossEmly.JPG|thumb|right|200px|St Ailbe's Cross in Emly.]]\nIn [[Emly]], there is a [[Catholic Church in Ireland|Catholic]] church dedicated to St Ailbe which dates to the late nineteenth century.

Amberley Publishing (Stroud), 2009.</ref> This genealogy is almost certainly fictitious but it may be significant that he was thought of as having a British origin, while the epithet ''Saint Breudan'' (if not for 'Brittany') might conceivably suggest some kind of special  symbolic link with 'Britain'.\n\nThat the connection with Saint David goes back a long way, in any case, is demonstrated by the fact that in the earliest Irish ''Vita'' (perhaps of the 8th c.)  an incident is described in which Ailbe prophesies that a pregnant woman will give birth to a famous bishop, David (''Vita Albei'' 21) That the links between Pembrokeshire and Ireland go back to the fifth century is well known, meanwhile. As Dagmar \u00d3 Riain-Raedel has noted, at that time \"the settlements of the ''D\u00e9isi'' and ''U\u00ed Liath\u00e1in'' of East Munster in South West Wales established an important link between Britain and Ireland\" and, one might add, specifically between Pembrokeshire (and so potentially 'Menevia' or Saint David's) and the Munster in which Emly may have been an early significant centre.\n\nAs noted above the earliest Irish Life records that Ailbe was taken by Britons from Ireland to Britain and could therefore be seen as coming (back) from there to Ireland before performing his missionary work.  Arguably this might have been a story invented to reconcile his Irish birth with an enduring tradition of his actual British origin\n\n==Possible pre-Christian origins==\nProfessor [[P\u00e1draig \u00d3 Riain]] suggests the cult of Saint Ailbe may have pre-Christian origins.<ref>Padraig O'Riain, s.v.

For instance ''Ailbe'' was the name of the 'divine hound'  in \"[[The Tale of Mac Da Th\u00f3's Pig]]\" <ref>trans. in Cross, T.P. and Slover, C.H. (1936) \"Ancient Irish Tales\", New York; pp. 68-76 in Koch, John T and Carey, John ed. 2003 \"The Celtic Heroic Age\", Celtic Studies Publications: Aberystwyth</ref> associated with the ''Mag Ailbe'' or 'plain of Ailbe',<ref>note 84 in Kenney J.F. (1929) \"Sources for the Early History of Ireland: Vol 1, Ecclesiastical\", Columbia (reprinted New York 1966)</ref> where stood a  ''Lia Ailbe'', or 'stone of Ailbe'.  The 'divine hound' ''Ailbe'' defended Leinster, the chief centre of which was ''Aillen'', whose female eponym, ''Aillen'', owned a marvellous lap dog ''Ailbe'', according to the  'Metrical [[Dindsenchas]]'.To these 'canine' associations one might compare the tradition which identified Ailbe\u2019s father as \u2018''Ol-chu''\u2019 (\u2018''Olcnais''\u2019 in ''Vita Albei'' 1), \u2018great-hound\u2019, as well as the (likely related) story of the infant Ailbe being cared for by a she-wolf\n\nAn \u2018''Ailbe Gr\u00faadbrecc''\u2019, meanwhile,was the daughter of ''[[Cormac mac Airt]]'' (premier mythical Irish king) and a wife (as her sister ''[[Gr\u00e1inne]]'') of ''Finn'' (= literally, \u2018white\u2019) or [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]] in the ''Tochmarc Ailbe'',<ref>p. 276 in O\u2019Rahilly, T,F.

An ''Ailbe'' was also daughter of ''[[Mider]]'', son of the ''[[Dagda]].'' <ref>Dooley, op.cit. p.15</ref>\n\n==The name \"Ailbe\"==\nThe name ''Ailbe'' was explained in the ''Vita Albei'' as derivative of ''ail'' 'a rock' and ''beo'', 'living'. In the words of Baring Gould and Fisher <ref>Baring-Gould and Fisher (1907), \"The Lives of the British Saints\" Vol I, p. 130 [https://archive.org/details/livesofbritishsa01bariuoft]</ref> this is \"a very doubtful  etymology\". It is clearly related to the story of his being exposed behind a rock after his birth, before being cared for by a wolf (''Vita Albei'' 2) <ref>Heist op.cit. 167-81; trans. De Paor op.cit pp. 227-43</ref>  and looks very much like a folk-etymology. \nNevertheless, we can note a sporadic association of Ailbe (as saint or mythological figure) with ' rocks' (Irish ''ail''). The ''Lia Ailbe'' (stone of Ailbe) on the ''Magh Ailbe'' (plain of Ailbe) may be in origin tautological, while a  ''Sliabh Ailbe'' was associated with a legendary figure ''Ailbe'' in ''Duanaire Finn''.<ref>II, 95, xlii in MacNeill, Eoin and Murphy, Gerard (1908-54) Duanaire Finn,  3 vols, Irish Texts Society 7, 28, 43.</ref>   The ''Inbher Ailbhine''   mentioned in Tirechan's ''Vita Patricii'' (''Tirechan'' 5.2)<ref>Bieler op.cit p. 127</ref>  may contain ''ail'', \u2018a rock\u2019, according to Watson.<ref>p. 469, note 1 in Watson, W.J.

There does, however, appear the root  ''albi(i\u032d)o-'', 'world' in the Brittonic Celtic languages: as seen for instance in Wesh ''elfydd'', 'world, land'.

This appears in Irish as ''Albe-'', ''Alpe-'' and ''Albu'', ''Alpu''.  There is, however, no obvious explanation for this name to appear in the form ''ailbe'' and the root  ''albi(i\u032d)o-'' would not take that form in Irish, according to the way that language normally developed.  The ''i'', in the  ''ai'' of ''Ailbe'', is not a full vowel but represents an audible \u2018glide\u2019 before a palatised ''l''.<ref>pp. 55-7, \u00a786 in Thurneysen, Rudolf (1946) \"A Grammar of Old Irish\", Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies</ref> This palatised ''l'', with ''i''-glide is not found in Irish ''Albu'', 'Britain'.\n\nAll of this renders the precise form of the name ''Ailbe'', in Irish, arguably, somewhat mysterious.\n\n==Interpretation as a localised version of the cult of Saint Alban==\nPhilip Thornhill <ref>Thornhill, Philip (2000) \"The Sub-Roman Cult of Saint Alban\" (\"St. Alban and the End of Roman Britain Part 1\")  in 'The Mankind Quarterly' 41, pp. 3-42. [http://www.unz.org/Pub/MankindQuarterly-2000q1-00003] (Revised Version [https://www.academia.edu/31861781/Saint_Alban_and_the_End_of_Roman_Britain_revised_version_])</ref> has argued that the Irish cult of Ailbe represents in origin a localised version of the cult of the British martyr [[Saint Alban]]. The latter is explained as being rooted  itself in pre-Christian religion or mythology but also as bearing some relation to [[Albion]] as the ancient name for Britain and  designed to serve as a symbol for the corporate identity of the Britons in the new Christian era. It will have been, according to this argument, to some extent a 're-invention' designed to serve a political purpose in unifying the Britons, probably under the dominance of ''[[Verulamium]]'' (the modern [[Saint Albans]]) where the cult of the martyr Alban was most probably based.\n\nCritical to the theory is the interpretation of the [[Elafius]] mentioned in the [[Vita Germani]], or Life of [[Germanus of Auxerre|Saint Germanus]], as a mis-hearing, in a garbled version of the story of Saint Germanus's visit to Britain, of the name ''Albios'' or ''Albius'', as an alternative name for ''Albanus'' \u2013 the latter possibly representing a later version of the name, perhaps introduced by Germanus. A Celtic ''Albios'' or vulgar Latin ''Albius'', pronounced in a British-Celtic way, would have given \u2013 so Thornhill argues \u2013 a name ''Ailbe'', if borrowed into Irish. The ''ei'' in the Welsh form (''Llan'')''eilfyw'' would be explained by the process of ''i''-assimilation, a feature of the development of the Brittonic Celtic languages  and a process which would have been underway by the 5th century.<ref>pp. in 260, 238-9, 247-8 Sims-Williams, Patrick (1990) \"Dating the Transition to Neo-Brittonic: Phonology and History, 400 to 600\" in  A Bammesberger, A. Wollman, ed., \"Britain 400 to 600: Language and History\",  Heidelberg: Winter; cf. pp. 558, 560-1 (lenition b to \u0180) & 579-618 (final i-affection) in  Jackson, Kenneth. H  (1953) \"Language and History in Early Britain\", Edinburgh.</ref> The change from ''a'' to ''ei'' by the effect of the following ''i'' (''i''-assimilation) would be typical of the North West (latterly Welsh) dialects of the ancient British language \u2013 and it is likely the cult would have spread from nearby Wales to Ireland. The ''l'' with ''i''-glide seen in Irish ''ailbe'' would have been the nearest Irish equivalent to the ''ei-'' in a Brittonic name  ''Eilbhios'' < ''Albios/us'' undergoing ''i''-assimilation.\n\nThornhill quotes [[Prosper of Aquitaine]]<ref>Prosper of Aquitaine, ''Prosperi Tironis Epitoma Chronicon'', in ''Monumenta Germaniae Historica'' (''MGH''), ''Chronica Minora'' vol 1, 1892,  Mommsen, Theodore, ed., Berlin: Weidemann pp. 385-485;  Migne, ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'' vol.51 [http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/30_10_0390-0463-_Prosperus_Aquitanus.html]; English trans. in \"From Roman to Merovingian Gaul: A Reader\" ed. & trans. A. C Murray (Ontario, 2003) pp. 62\u201376</ref> who reports the sending of Palladius (said in the ''Vita Albei'' to have baptised Ailbe) in 431, a few years after Germanus visited the cult centre of Saint Alban in Britain in 429.   \n \nFor the 'British connections' of the cult of saint Ailbe see above. It might be possible that the name was introduced by an actual (missionary) Briton named ''Albios/us'' but that would leave the occurrence of the name in early Irish literature and folk tale hard to explain. Thornhill argues that these medieval sources represent not only ancient pagan mythology but also syncretic influences that might have been at work from the 5th century onwards. The name Ailbe would have entered into the folk tradition through the displacement of an original pagan cult at Emly which it may have become identified with  and through the typical pagan-mythological, probably solar, associations of the root ''albho-'' which may have had their equivalent in Irish tradition. Thornhill points in particular to a likely assimilation to the pagan (probably solar) deity ''Aillil'' or ''Aillen'', connected  with the ''Ui Aillelo'' associated with the second saint 'Ailbe of Sencua', the warrior ''Aillil'' on whose chariot the head of the 'divine hound' ''Ailbhe'' ends up being impaled and  the female eponym of ''Aillen'', near the ''Mag Ailbhe'', whose marvellous lap-dog was called ''Ailbhe''. Thornhill suggests that a parallel assimilation occurred in Britain to the ''Al-'' of ''Alauna'' (a Celtic toponym and theonym) and related names, and that a typical outcome of this assimilation was  the element ''El-'' found in several Brittonic saints' names. He also compares the ''Navigatio'''s 'island of Ailbe' to the 'island of Britain' or ''Albion'' as (so he argues) associated with ''Albios/Albanus''.'Al = Rock[y]; Ban/Ben', 'means Mountain'\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:StAilbe'sCrossEmly.JPG|thumb|right|200px|St Ailbe's Cross in Emly.]]\nIn [[Emly]], there is a [[Catholic Church in Ireland|Catholic]] church dedicated to St Ailbe which dates to the late nineteenth century.

They have been extensively studied because of their medical, veterinary, and economic importances, because the flies can be raised in a laboratory, and because they  are relatively large, facilitating their analysis.\n\n===Morphology===\nTsetse flies can be seen as independent individuals in two forms: as third-[[instar]] larvae, and as adults.\n\nTsetse first become separate from their mothers during the third larval instar, during which they have the typical appearance of [[Fly#Maggots|maggots]]. However, this life stage is short, lasting at most a few hours, and is almost never observed outside of the laboratory.\n\nTsetse next develop a hard external case, the puparium, and become pupae&mdash;small, hard-shelled, oblongs with two distinctive, small, dark lobes at the tail (breathing) end. Tsetse pupae are under 1 cm long.<ref name=\"Jordan\">{{Cite book |author=A. M. Jordan |year=1986 |title=Trypanosomaisis control and African rural development |publisher=London and New York: [[Longman]]}}</ref> Within the puparial shell, tsetse complete the last two larval instars and the pupal stage.\n\nAt the end of the pupal stage, tsetse emerge as adult flies. The adults are relatively large flies, with lengths of 0.5-1.5&nbsp;cm,<ref name=\"Jordan\"/> and have a recognizable shape or [[bauplan]] which makes them easy to distinguish from other flies. Tsetse have large heads, distinctly separated eyes, and unusual antennae. The [[Thorax (insect anatomy)|thorax]] is quite large, while the abdomen is wide rather than elongated and shorter than the wings.\n\nFour characteristics definitively separate adult tsetse from other kinds of flies:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| '''Proboscis''' || Tsetse have a distinct proboscis, a long thin structure attached to the bottom of the head and pointing forward. || [[Image:tsetse head-proboscis.jpeg|center|70px|A photograph of the head of a tsetse illustrating the forward pointing proboscis]]\n|-\n| '''Folded wings''' || When at rest, tsetse fold their wings completely one on top of the other. || [[Image:tsetse foldedWings.jpeg|center|200px|A photograph of the whole body of a tsetse illustrating the folded wings when at rest]]\n|-\n| '''Hatchet cell''' || The discal medial (\"middle\") cell of the wing has a characteristic hatchet shape resembling a meat cleaver or a hatchet. || [[Image:tsetse hatchetCell.jpeg|center|140px|A photograph of the wing of a tsetse illustrating the hatchet shaped central cell]]\n|-\n| '''Branched arista hairs''' || The antennae have arista with hairs which are themselves branched. || [[Image:tsetse aristaHairs labeled.jpeg|center|140px|A photograph and diagram of the head of a tsetse illustrating the branched hairs of the antenna's arista]]\n|}\n\n===Anatomy===\nLike all other [[insect]]s, tsetse flies have an adult body comprising three visibly distinct parts: the head, the thorax and the abdomen.\n\nThe head has large eyes, distinctly separated on each side, and a distinct, forward-pointing proboscis attached underneath by a large bulb. The thorax is large, made of three fused segments. Three pairs of legs are attached to the thorax, as are two wings and two [[halteres]]. The abdomen is short but wide and changes dramatically in volume during feeding.\n\nThe internal anatomy of tsetse is fairly typical of the [[insect]]s. The [[crop (anatomy)|crop]] is large enough to accommodate a huge increase in size during the bloodmeal since tsetse can take a bloodmeal equal in weight to themselves. The reproductive tract of adult females includes a [[uterus]] which can become large enough to hold the third-instar [[larva]] at the end of each [[pregnancy]]. The article [[Parasitic flies of domestic animals]] has a diagram of anatomy of dipteran flies.\n\nMost tsetse flies are physically very tough. Houseflies are easily killed with a flyswatter, but a great deal of effort is needed to crush a tsetse fly.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n===Life cycle===\n[[File:glossina palpalis morsitans.jpg|300px|right|thumb|''Glossina palpalis'' and ''G. morsitans'' from a 1920 lexicon]]\n\nTsetse have an unusual [[Biological life cycle|lifecycle]] which may be due to the richness of their food source. A female fertilizes only one egg at a time and retains each egg within her uterus to have the offspring develop internally during the first three [[Instar|larval stages]], a method called [[adenotrophic viviparity]]. During this time, the female feeds the developing offspring with a milky substance secreted by a modified gland in the uterus.<ref>Geoffrey M. Attardoa, Claudia Lohs, Abdelaziz Heddi, Uzma H.

The newly independent tsetse larva crawls into the ground, and develops a hard outer shell called the puparial case, in which it completes its morphological transformation into an adult fly.\n\nThis lifestage has a variable duration, generally 20 to 30 days, and the larva must rely on stored resources during this time. The importance of the richness of blood to this development can be seen, since all tsetse development before it emerges from the puparial case as a full adult occurs without feeding, based only on nutritional resources provided by the female parent. The female must get enough energy for her needs, for the needs of her developing offspring, and for the stored resources which her offspring will require until it emerges as an adult.\n\nTechnically, these insects undergo the standard [[morphogenesis|development]] process of insects, which consists of [[oocyte]] formation, ovulation, fertilization, development of the egg, three [[larva]]l stages, a [[pupa]]l stage, and the emergence and maturation of the adult.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n===Genetics===\nThe genome of ''Glossina morsitans'' was sequenced in 2014.<ref>[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/344/6182/380 \"Genome sequence of the tsetse fly (Glossina morsitans): vector of African trypanosomiasis\"], Science. 2014 Apr 25; 344(6</ref>\n\n===Symbionts===\nTsetse flies have three known [[Endosymbiont|symbionts]].

They belong to the superfamily Hippoboscoidea, in which the tsetse's family, the Glossinidae, is one of four families of blood-feeding obligate parasites.\n\nUp to 34 species and subspecies of tsetse flies are recognized, depending on the particular classification used.\n\nAll current classifications place all the tsetse species in a single genus named ''Glossina''. Most classifications place this genus as the sole member of the family Glossinidae. The Glossinidae are generally placed within the superfamily [[Hippoboscoidea]], which contains other [[hematophagous]] families.\n\n===Species===\nThe tsetse genus is generally split into three groups of species based on a combination of distributional, behavioral, molecular and morphological characteristics.

In 1887, the rinderpest virus was accidentally imported in livestock brought by an Italian expeditionary force to Eritrea. It spread rapidly, reaching Ethiopia by 1888, the Atlantic coast by 1892 and South Africa by 1897. Rinderpest, a cattle plague from central Asia, killed over 90% of the cattle of the pastoral peoples such as the [[Maasai people|Masai]] of east Africa. With no native [[immunity (medical)|immunity]], most of the population \u2013 some 5.5 million cattle \u2013 died in southern Africa. Pastoralists were left with no animals - their source of income; and farmers were deprived of their working animals for ploughing and irrigation. The pandemic coincided with a period of drought, causing widespread famine. The starving human populations died of smallpox, cholera, typhoid and diseases imported from Europe. It's estimated that two-thirds of the Masai died in 1891. <ref name=Pearce2000>{{cite journal |last1=Pearce |first1=Fred |title=Inventing Africa |journal=New Scientist |date=12 August 2000 |volume=167 |issue=2251 |page=30 |url=http://www.faculty.umb.edu/pjt/pearce00.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe land was left emptied of its cattle and its people, enabling the colonial powers Germany and Britain to take over Tanzania and Kenya with little effort. With greatly reduced grazing, grassland turned rapidly to bush. The closely cropped grass sward was replaced in a few years by woody grassland and thornbush, ideal habitat for tsetse flies. Wild mammal populations increased rapidly, accompanied by the tsetse fly. [[Highland]] regions of east Africa which had been free of tsetse fly were colonised by the pest, accompanied by sleeping sickness, until then unknown in the area. Millions of people died of the disease in the early 20th century. <ref name=Pearce2000/>\n\n[[File:Masai Giraffe, Serengeti National Park, Tanzania (2010).jpg|thumb|[[Serengeti National Park]], Tanzania]]\n\nThe areas occupied by the tsetse fly were largely barred to [[animal husbandry]]. Sleeping sickness was dubbed \"the best game warden in Africa\" by conservationists, who assumed that the land, empty of people and full of game animals, had always been like that. [[Julian Huxley]] of the [[World Wildlife Fund]] called the plains of east Africa \"a surviving sector of the rich natural world as it was before the rise of modern man\". <ref name=Pearce2000/> They created numerous large reserves for hunting [[safari]]s. In 1909 the newly retired president [[Theodore Roosevelt]] went on a safari that brought over 10,000 animal carcasses to America. Later, much of the land was turned over to nature reserves and [[national parks]] such as the [[Serengeti]], [[Masai Mara]], [[Kruger Park|Kruger]] and [[Okavango Delta]]. The result, across eastern and southern Africa, is a modern landscape of manmade ecosystems: farmland and pastoral land largely free of bush and tsetse fly; and bush controlled by the tsetse fly. <ref name=Pearce2000/>\n\n===Situation===\n\nTsetse flies are regarded as a major cause of rural poverty in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] because they prevent mixed farming. The land infested with tsetse flies is often cultivated by people using hoes rather than more efficient draught animals because ''[[nagana]]'', the disease transmitted by tsetse, weakens and often kills these animals. Cattle that do survive produce little milk, pregnant cows often abort their calves, and manure is not available to fertilize the worn-out soils.\n[[File:Tsetse-BKF-2.jpg|right|thumb|Tsetse fly from Burkina Faso]]\n\nThe disease ''nagana'' or African [[animal trypanosomiasis]] (AAT) causes gradual health decline in infected livestock, reduces milk and meat production, and increases abortion rates.  Animals eventually succumb to the disease (annual cattle deaths caused by trypanosomiasis are estimated at 3 million). This has an enormous impact on the livelihood of farmers who live in tsetse-infested areas, as infected animals cannot be used to plough the land, and keeping cattle is only feasible when the animals are kept under constant [[prophylactic]] treatment with [[trypanocidal]] drugs, often with associated problems of drug resistance, counterfeited drugs, and suboptimal dosage. The overall annual direct lost potential in livestock and crop production was estimated at US$4.5 billion.<ref name=\"Budd, L 1999\">Budd, L. 1999.

Most of the 37 countries infested with tsetse are poor, debt-ridden and underdeveloped. Of the 39 tsetse-infested countries, 32 are [http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/lifdc/en/ low-income, food-deficit countries], 29 are [[least developed countries]], and 30 are among the 40 most [[heavily indebted poor countries]]. Eradicating the tsetse and trypanosomiasis (T&T) problem would allow rural Africans to use these areas for [[animal husbandry]] or the cultivation of crops and hence increase food production. Only 45 million cattle, of 172 million present in sub-Saharan Africa, are kept in tsetse-infested areas but are often forced into fragile ecosystems like highlands or the [[semiarid]] [[Sahel]] zone, which increases overgrazing and overuse of land for food production.\n\nIn addition to this direct impact, the presence of tsetse and trypanosomiasis discourages the use of more productive exotic and cross-bred cattle, depresses the growth and affects the distribution of livestock populations, reduces the potential opportunities for livestock and crop production (mixed farming) through less draught power to cultivate land and less manure to fertilize (in an environment-friendly way) soils for better crop production, and affects human settlements (people tend to avoid areas with tsetse flies).\n\nTsetse flies transmit a similar disease to humans, called [[African trypanosomiasis]] - human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) or sleeping sickness. An estimated 70 million people in 20 countries are at different levels of risk<ref>Simarro PP, Cecchi G, Franco JR, Paone M, Diarra A, Ruiz-Postigo JA, et al. (2012).

The [[DALY]] index (disability-adjusted life years), an indicator to quantify the burden of disease, includes the impact of both the duration of life lost due to premature death and the duration of life lived with a disability. The annual burden of sleeping sickness is estimated at 2 million DALYs. Since the disease tends to affect economically active adults, the total cost to a family with a patient is about 25% of a year's income.<ref>Shaw, A.P.M., 2004. Economics of African trypanosomiasis.

Some tsetse-transmitted trypanosome species cause [[trypanosomiasis]], an infectious disease. In humans, tsetse transmitted trypanosomiasis is called [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]]. In animals, tsetse-vectored trypanosomiases include ''nagana'', ''souma'', and ''[[surra]]'' according to the animal infected and the trypanosome species involved. The usage is not strict and while ''nagana'' generally refers to the disease in cattle and horses it is commonly used for any  of animal trypanosomiasis.\n\nTrypanosomes are animal [[parasite]]s, specifically [[protozoa]]ns of the genus ''Trypanosoma''. These organisms are about the size of red blood cells. Different species of trypanosomes infect different hosts. They range widely in their effects on the vertebrate hosts. Some species, such as ''T. theileri'', do not seem to cause any health problems except perhaps in animals that are already sick.<ref name=\"Hoare\">{{cite book |author=C. A.

The name 'mechanical' reflects the similarity of this mode of transmission to mechanical injection with a [[syringe]]. Mechanical transmission requires the tsetse to feed on an infected host and acquire trypanosomes in the blood meal, and then, within a relatively short period, to feed on an uninfected host and regurgitate some of the infected blood from the first blood meal into the tissue of the uninfected animal. This type of transmission occurs most frequently when tsetse are interrupted during a blood meal and attempt to satiate themselves with another meal. Other flies, such as [[horse-fly|horse-flies]], can also cause mechanical transmission of trypanosomes.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Seasonal prevalence of bovine trypanosomosis in a tsetse-infested zone and a tsetse-free zone of the Amhara Region, north-west Ethiopia |journal=[[Onderstepoort Journal of Veterinary Research]] |year=2004 |volume=71 |issue=4 |pages=307\u201312 |author1=T.

The term 'biological' is used because trypanosomes must reproduce through several generations inside the tsetse host during the period of incubation, which requires extreme [[Adaptation (biology)|adaptation]] of the trypanosomes to their tsetse host. In this mode of transmission, trypanosomes reproduce through several generations, changing in morphology at certain periods. This mode of transmission also includes the sexual phase of the trypanosomes. Tsetse are believed to be more likely to become infected by trypanosomes during their first few blood meals. Tsetse infected by trypanosomes are thought to remain infected for the remainder of their lives. Because of the adaptations required for biological transmission, trypanosomes transmitted biologically by tsetse cannot be transmitted in this manner by other insects.\n\nThe relative importance of these two modes of transmission for the propagation of tsetse-vectored trypanosomiases is not yet well understood. However, since the sexual phase of the trypanosome lifecycle occurs within the tsetse host, biological transmission is a required step in the lifecycle of the tsetse-vectored trypanosomes.\n\nThe cycle of biological transmission of trypanosomiasis involves two phases, one inside the tsetse host and the other inside the vertebrate host. Trypanosomes are not passed between a pregnant tsetse and her offspring, so all newly emerged tsetse adults are free of infection. An uninfected fly that feeds on an infected vertebrate animal may acquire trypanosomes in its proboscis or gut. These trypanosomes, depending on the species, may remain in place, move to a different part of the digestive tract, or migrate through the tsetse body into the salivary glands. When an infected tsetse bites a susceptible host, the fly may regurgitate part of a previous blood meal that contains trypanosomes, or may inject trypanosomes in its saliva. Inoculation must contain a minimum of 300 to 450 individual trypanosomes to be successful, and may contain up to 40,000 cells.<ref name=\"Hoare\"/>\n\nThe trypanosomes are injected into vertebrate muscle tissue,{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} but make their way, first into the [[lymphatic system]], then into the bloodstream, and eventually into the brain. The disease causes the swelling of the lymph glands, emaciation of the body, and eventually leads to death. Uninfected tsetse may bite the infected animal prior to its death and acquire the disease, thereby closing the transmission cycle.\n\n===Disease hosts and vectors===\n\nThe tsetse-vectored trypanosomiases affect various vertebrate species including humans, antelopes, bovine cattle, camels, horses, sheep, goats, and pigs. These diseases are caused by several different trypanosome species that may also survive in wild animals such as crocodiles and monitor lizards. The diseases have different distributions across the African continent, so are transmitted by different species. This table summarizes this information:<ref name=\"Hoare\"/><ref>{{cite web |author=R.

This disease is invariably fatal unless treated but can almost always be cured with current medicines, if the disease is diagnosed early enough.\n\nSleeping sickness begins with a tsetse bite leading to an inoculation in the subcutaneous tissue. The infection moves into the [[lymphatic system]], leading to a characteristic swelling of the lymph glands called ''Winterbottom's sign''.<ref>[http://pathmicro.med.sc.edu/lecture/wint_sign.jpg]</ref> The infection progresses into the blood stream and eventually crosses into the [[central nervous system]] and invades the [[brain]] leading to extreme [[lethargy]] and eventually to [[death]].\n\nThe species ''Trypanosoma brucei'', which causes the disease, has often been subdivided into three subspecies that were identified based either on the vertebrate hosts which the strain could infect or on the virulence of the disease in humans. The trypanosomes infectious to animals and not to humans were named ''Trypanosoma brucei brucei''. Strains that infected humans were divided into two subspecies based on their different virulences: ''Trypanosoma brucei gambiense'' was thought to have a slower onset and ''Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense'' refers to strains with a more rapid, virulent onset. This characterization has always been problematic but was the best that could be done given the knowledge of the time and the tools available for identification. A recent molecular study using [[restriction fragment length polymorphism]] analysis suggests that the three subspecies are [[polyphyletic]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=G. Hide |year=1999 |title=History of Sleeping Sickness in East Africa |journal=[[Clinical Microbiology Reviews]] |volume=12 |pages=112\u2013125|doi=10.1128/CMR.12.1.112 |doi-access=free }}</ref> so the elucidation of the strains of ''T. brucei'' infective to humans requires a more complex explanation. [[Procyclin]]s are [[protein]]s developed in the surface coating of trypanosomes whilst in their tsetse fly vector.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.98.4.1513|pmid=11171982|title=The surface coat of procyclic Trypanosoma brucei: Programmed expression and proteolytic cleavage of procyclin in the tsetse fly|year=2001|last1=Acosta-Serrano|first1=A.|last2=Vassella|first2=E.|last3=Liniger|first3=M.|last4=Renggli|first4=C.

The most notable is American trypanosomiasis, known as [[Chagas disease]], which occurs in [[South America]], caused by ''Trypanosoma cruzi'', and transmitted by certain insects of the [[Reduviidae]], members of the [[Hemiptera]].\n\n===In domestic animals===\n{{main article|Animal trypanosomiasis}}\nAnimal [[trypanosomiasis]], also called ''nagana'' when it occurs in [[cattle|bovine cattle]] or [[horse]]s or ''sura'' when it occurs in domestic [[pig]]s, is caused by several trypanosome species. These [[disease]]s reduce the growth rate, [[milk]] productivity, and strength of [[farm]] animals, generally leading to the eventual [[death]] of the infected animals. Certain species of cattle are called ''trypanotolerant'' because they can survive and grow even when infected with trypanosomes although they also have lower productivity rates when infected.\n\nThe course of the disease in animals is similar to the course of [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]] in humans.\n\n''Trypanosoma congolense'' and ''Trypanosoma vivax'' are the two most important species infecting bovine cattle in [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. ''Trypanosoma simiae'' causes a virulent disease in [[swine]].\n\nOther forms of animal trypanosomiasis are also known from other areas of the globe, caused by different species of trypanosomes and transmitted without the intervention of the tsetse fly.\n\nThe tsetse fly vector ranges mostly in the central part of Africa.\n\n[[Trypanosomiasis]] poses a considerable constraint on livestock agricultural development in Tsetse fly infested areas of sub Saharan Africa, especially in west and central Africa. International research conducted by [[ILRI]] in [[Nigeria]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[Kenya]] has shown that the [[N'Dama]] is the most resistant breed. \u00a0<ref>http://www.fao.org/3/y5832e/y5832e05.htm</ref> <ref>https://www.slideshare.net/mobile/ILRI/animal-genetic-resources-characterization-and-conservation-research-in-africa-an-overview</ref>\n\n==Control==\nThe conquest of [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]] and [[nagana]] would be of immense benefit to rural development and contribute to poverty alleviation and improved food security in sub-Saharan Africa. Human African trypanosomosis ('''HAT''') and animal African trypanosomosis ('''AAT''') are sufficiently important to make virtually any intervention against these diseases beneficial.<ref>FAO. 2003. Economic guidelines for strategic planning of tsetse and trypanosomiasis control in West Africa, by A.P.M. Shaw. PAAT Technical and Scientific Series No. 5. Rome.</ref>\n[[File:Tsetse-BKF-3.jpg|right|thumb|Tsetse fly from Burkina Faso]]\nThe disease can be managed by controlling the vector and thus reducing the incidence of the disease by disrupting the transmission cycle. Another tactic to manage the disease is to target the disease directly using surveillance and [[curative care|curative]] or [[prophylactic]] treatments to reduce the number of hosts that carry the disease.\n\nEconomic analysis indicates that the cost of managing [[trypanosomosis]] through the elimination of important populations of major tsetse vectors will be covered several times by the benefits of tsetse-free status.<ref name=\"Budd, L 1999\"/> Area-wide interventions against the tsetse and trypanosomosis problem appear more efficient and profitable if sufficiently large areas, with high numbers of cattle, can be covered.\n\nVector control strategies can aim at either continuous [[Pest control|suppression or eradication]] of target populations. Tsetse fly eradication programmes are complex and logistically demanding activities and usually involve the integration of different control tactics, such as [[trypanocidal]] drugs, [[impregnated treated targets]] (ITT), [[insecticide-treated cattle]] (ITC), [[aerial spraying]] ([[Sequential Aerosol Technique]] - SAT) and in some situations the release of sterile males ([[sterile insect technique]] \u2013 SIT). To ensure sustainability of the results, it is critical to apply the control tactics on an '''area-wide basis''', i.e. '''targeting an entire tsetse population''' that is preferably [[genetically isolated]].\n\n===Control techniques===\nMany techniques have reduced tsetse populations, with earlier, crude methods recently replaced by methods that are cheaper, more directed, and ecologically better.\n\n====Slaughter of wild animals====\nOne early technique involved slaughtering all the wild animals tsetse fed on. For example, the island of [[Principe]] off the west coast of Africa was entirely cleared of [[feral]] pigs in the 1930s, which led to the [[Local extinction|extirpation]] of the fly. While the fly eventually re-invaded in the 1950s, the new population of tsetse was free from the disease.'''\n\n====Land clearing====\nAnother early technique involved complete removal of brush and woody vegetation from an area. Tsetse tend to rest on the trunks of trees so removing woody vegetation made the area inhospitable to the flies. However, the technique was not widely used and has been abandoned. Preventing regrowth of woody vegetation requires continuous clearing efforts, which is only practical where large human populations are present. The clearing of woody vegetation has come to be seen as an environmental problem more than a benefit.\n\n====Pesticide campaigns====\n[[Pesticides]] have been used to control tsetse starting initially during the early part of the twentieth century in localized efforts using the inorganic metal-based pesticides, expanding after the Second World War into massive aerial- and ground-based campaigns with organochlorine pesticides such as [[DDT]] applied as [[aerosol]] sprays at [[Ultra-Low Volume]] rates.  Later, more targeted techniques used ''pour-on'' [[pesticide formulation|formulations]] in which advanced organic pesticides were applied directly to the backs of cattle.\n\n====Trapping====\n[[Image:TsetseTrap.jpg|right|thumb|Tsetse trap]]\nTsetse populations can be monitored and effectively controlled using simple, inexpensive traps. These often use electric blue cloth, since this color attracts the flies. Early traps mimicked the form of cattle but this seems unnecessary and recent traps are simple sheets or have a biconical form. The traps can kill by channeling the flies into a collection chamber or by exposing the flies to insecticide sprayed on the cloth. Tsetse are also attracted to large dark colors like the hides of cow and buffaloes. Some scientists put forward the idea that [[zebra]] have stripes, not as a camouflage in long grass, but because the black and white bands tend to confuse tsetse and prevent attack.<ref>{{cite news|last=Doyle-Burr|first=Nora|title=Scientists unravel mystery of zebra stripes|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2012/0209/Scientists-unravel-mystery-of-zebra-stripes|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=May 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1242/jeb.065540| title = Polarotactic tabanids find striped patterns with brightness and/or polarization modulation least attractive: An advantage of zebra stripes| journal = Journal of Experimental Biology| volume = 215| issue = 5| pages = 736\u2013745| year = 2012| last1 = Egri | first1 = A.| last2 = Blaho | first2 = M.| last3 = Kriska | first3 = G.| last4 = Farkas | first4 = R.| last5 = Gyurkovszky | first5 = M.| last6 = Akesson | first6 = S.| last7 = Horvath | first7 = G. | pmid=22323196| doi-access = free}}</ref>\n\nThe use of chemicals as attractants to lure tsetse to the traps has been studied extensively in the late 20th century, but this has mostly been of interest to scientists rather than as an economically reasonable solution. Attractants studied have been those tsetse might use to find food, like carbon dioxide, octenol, and acetone&mdash;which are given off in animals' breath and distributed downwind in an ''odor plume.'' Synthetic versions of these chemicals can create artificial odor plumes. A cheaper approach is to place cattle urine in a half gourd near the trap. For large trapping efforts, additional traps are generally cheaper than expensive artificial attractants.\n\nA special trapping method is applied in Ethiopia, where the BioFarm Consortium (ICIPE, BioVision Foundation, BEA, Helvetas, DLCO-EA, [[Praxis Ethiopia]]) applies the traps in a sustainable agriculture and rural development context (SARD). The traps are just the entry point, followed by improved farming, human health and marketing inputs. This method is in the final stage of testing (as per 2006).\n\n====Sterile insect technique====\nThe [[sterile insect technique]] ('''SIT''') is a form of pest control that uses [[ionizing radiation]] ([[gamma ray]] or [[X ray]]) to sterilize male flies that are mass-produced in special rearing facilities. The sterile males are released systematically from the ground or by air in tsetse-infested areas, where they mate with wild females, which do not produce offspring. As a result, this technique can eventually eradicate populations of wild flies. SIT is among the most [[environmentally friendly]] control tactics available, and is usually applied as the final component of an integrated campaign. It has been used to subdue the populations of many other fly species including the medfly, [[Ceratitis capitata|''Ceratitis Capitata'']].\n\nThe sustainable removal of the tsetse fly is in many cases the most cost-effective way of dealing with the T&T problem resulting in major economic benefits for subsistence farmers in rural areas. Insecticide-based methods are normally very ineffective in removing the last remnants of tsetse populations, while, on the contrary, sterile males are very effective in finding and mating the last remaining females. Therefore, the integration of the SIT as the last component of an area-wide integrated approach is essential in many situations to achieve complete eradication of the different tsetse populations, particularly in areas of more dense vegetation.\n\nA project that was implemented from 1994 to 1997 on the Island of [[Unguja]], [[Zanzibar]] (United Republic of [[Tanzania]]), demonstrated that, after suppression of the tsetse population with insecticides, SIT completely removed the ''[[Glossina austeni]]'' Newstead population from the Island (<ref>Vreysen, M.J.B., Saleh, K.M., Ali, M.Y., Abdulla, A.M., Zhu, Z.-R., Juma, K.G., Dyck, V.A., Msangi, A.R., Mkonyi, P.A., Feldmann, H.U., 2000. Glossina austeni (Diptera: Glossinidae ) eradicated on the island of Unguja, Zanzibar, using the sterile insect technique. J. Econ. Entomol. 93, 123\u2013135</ref>).  The eradication of the tsetse fly from Unguja Island in 1997 was followed by the disappearance of the AAT which enabled farmers to integrate livestock keeping with cropping in areas where this had been impossible before. The increased livestock and crop productivity and the possibility of using animals for transport and traction significantly contributed to an increase in the quality of people's lives (<ref>Tambi, E.N., Maina, O.W., Mukhebi, A.W. & Randolph, T.F. 1999.

Livestock and agriculture development in Zanzibar, post-tsetse eradication: a follow-up socio-economic study. Report prepared for the International Atomic Energy Agency. IAEA, Vienna, Austria.</ref>). A recent entomological survey (2015) jointly carried out by independent experts and the Department of Veterinary Services of Zanzibar has confirmed the tsetse-free status of the island, 18 years after eradication was declared.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nIn the [[Niayes]] region of [[Senegal]], a coastal area close to [[Dakar]], livestock keeping was difficult due to the presence of a population of ''[[Glossina palpalis gambiensis]]''. Feasibility studies indicated that the fly population was confined to very fragmented habitats and a population genetics study indicated that the population was genetically isolated from the main tsetse belt in the south eastern part of Senegal. After completion of the feasibility studies (2006\u20132010), an area-wide integrated eradication campaign that included an SIT component was started in 2011, and by 2015, the Niayes region had become almost tsetse fly free.<ref>IAEA 2015.

The prevalence of AAT has decreased from 40-50% before the project started to less than 10% to date in blocks 1 and 2. Although insecticides are being used for fly suppression, they are applied for short periods on traps, nets and livestock, and are not spread into the environment. After the suppression activities are completed, no more insecticide is applied in the area. The removal of trypanosomosis will eliminate the need for constant prophylactic treatments of the cattle with trypanocidal drugs, therefore reducing [[residue (chemistry)|residue]]s of these drugs in the [[Feces|dung]], meat and milk.\n\nThe main beneficiaries of the project are the many small holder farmers, the larger commercial farms and the consumers of meat and milk.

In addition, it is expected that the number of cattle will be reduced by 45%, which will result in reduced environmental impacts.\n\n==Effect on societal development==\n\nIn the literature of [[environmental determinism]], the tsetse has been linked to difficulties during early [[state formation]] for areas where the fly is prevalent. A 2012 study used population growth models, physiological data, and ethnographic data to examine pre-colonial agricultural practices and isolate the effects of the fly. A \"tsetse suitability index\" was developed from insect population growth, climate and geospatial data to simulate the fly's population steady state. An increase in the tsetse suitability index was associated with a statistically significant weakening of the agriculture, levels of urbanization, institutions and subsistence strategies. Results suggest that the tsetse decimated livestock populations, forcing early states to rely on slave labor to clear land for farming, and preventing farmers from taking advantage of natural animal fertilizers to increase crop production. These long-term effects may have kept population density low and discouraged cooperation between small-scale communities, thus preventing stronger nations from forming.\n\nThe authors also suggest that under a lower burden of tsetse, Africa would have developed differently. Agriculture (measured by the usage of large domesticated animals, intensive agriculture, plow use and female participation rate in agriculture) as well as institutions (measured by the appearance of indigenous slavery and levels of centralization) would have been more like those found in Eurasia. Qualitative support for this claim comes from archaeological findings; e.g., [[Great Zimbabwe]] is located in the African highlands where the fly does not occur, and represented the largest and technically most advanced precolonial structure in sub-Sahara Africa.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Alsan|first1=Marcella|title=The Effect of the Tsetse fly on African Development|journal=American Economic Review|date=January 2015|volume=105|issue=105|pages=382\u2013410|doi=10.1257/aer.20130604|url=http://healthpolicy.fsi.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/tsetse.pdf}}</ref>\n\nOther authors are more skeptical that the Tsetse fly had such an immense influence on African development. One conventional argument is that the Tsetse fly made it difficult to use draught animals. Hence, wheeled forms of transportations were not used as well. While this is certainly true for areas with high densities of the fly, similar cases outside tsetse-suitable areas exist. While the fly definitely had a relevant influence on the adaption of new technologies in Africa, it has been contested that it does not represent the single root cause.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chaves|first=Isa\u00edas|last2=Engerman|first2=Stanley|last3=Robinson|first3=James|date=2013|title=Reinventing the Wheel: The Economic Benefits of Wheeled Transportation in Early British Colonial West Africa|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w19673.pdf|language=en|location=Cambridge, MA|doi=10.3386/w19673}}</ref>\n\n==''T. brucei'' sexual cycle==\n\n[[Trypanosoma brucei|''T. brucei'']] are able to undergo meiotic [[sexual reproduction]].

They have been extensively studied because of their medical, veterinary, and economic importances, because the flies can be raised in a laboratory, and because they  are relatively large, facilitating their analysis.\n\n===Morphology===\nTsetse flies can be seen as independent individuals in two forms: as third-[[instar]] larvae, and as adults.\n\nTsetse first become separate from their mothers during the third larval instar, during which they have the typical appearance of [[Fly#Maggots|maggots]]. However, this life stage is short, lasting at most a few hours, and is almost never observed outside of the laboratory.\n\nTsetse next develop a hard external case, the puparium, and become pupae&mdash;small, hard-shelled, oblongs with two distinctive, small, dark lobes at the tail (breathing) end. Tsetse pupae are under 1 cm long.<ref name=\"Jordan\">{{Cite book |author=A. M. Jordan |year=1986 |title=Trypanosomaisis control and African rural development |publisher=London and New York: [[Longman]]}}</ref> Within the puparial shell, tsetse complete the last two larval instars and the pupal stage.\n\nAt the end of the pupal stage, tsetse emerge as adult flies. The adults are relatively large flies, with lengths of 0.5-1.5&nbsp;cm,<ref name=\"Jordan\"/> and have a recognizable shape or [[bauplan]] which makes them easy to distinguish from other flies. Tsetse have large heads, distinctly separated eyes, and unusual antennae. The [[Thorax (insect anatomy)|thorax]] is quite large, while the abdomen is wide rather than elongated and shorter than the wings.\n\nFour characteristics definitively separate adult tsetse from other kinds of flies:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| '''Proboscis''' || Tsetse have a distinct proboscis, a long thin structure attached to the bottom of the head and pointing forward. || [[Image:tsetse head-proboscis.jpeg|center|70px|A photograph of the head of a tsetse illustrating the forward pointing proboscis]]\n|-\n| '''Folded wings''' || When at rest, tsetse fold their wings completely one on top of the other. || [[Image:tsetse foldedWings.jpeg|center|200px|A photograph of the whole body of a tsetse illustrating the folded wings when at rest]]\n|-\n| '''Hatchet cell''' || The discal medial (\"middle\") cell of the wing has a characteristic hatchet shape resembling a meat cleaver or a hatchet. || [[Image:tsetse hatchetCell.jpeg|center|140px|A photograph of the wing of a tsetse illustrating the hatchet shaped central cell]]\n|-\n| '''Branched arista hairs''' || The antennae have arista with hairs which are themselves branched. || [[Image:tsetse aristaHairs labeled.jpeg|center|140px|A photograph and diagram of the head of a tsetse illustrating the branched hairs of the antenna's arista]]\n|}\n\n===Anatomy===\nLike all other [[insect]]s, tsetse flies have an adult body comprising three visibly distinct parts: the head, the thorax and the abdomen.\n\nThe head has large eyes, distinctly separated on each side, and a distinct, forward-pointing proboscis attached underneath by a large bulb. The thorax is large, made of three fused segments. Three pairs of legs are attached to the thorax, as are two wings and two [[halteres]]. The abdomen is short but wide and changes dramatically in volume during feeding.\n\nThe internal anatomy of tsetse is fairly typical of the [[insect]]s. The [[crop (anatomy)|crop]] is large enough to accommodate a huge increase in size during the bloodmeal since tsetse can take a bloodmeal equal in weight to themselves. The reproductive tract of adult females includes a [[uterus]] which can become large enough to hold the third-instar [[larva]] at the end of each [[pregnancy]]. The article [[Parasitic flies of domestic animals]] has a diagram of anatomy of dipteran flies.\n\nMost tsetse flies are physically very tough. Houseflies are easily killed with a flyswatter, but a great deal of effort is needed to crush a tsetse fly.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n===Life cycle===\n[[File:glossina palpalis morsitans.jpg|300px|right|thumb|''Glossina palpalis'' and ''G. morsitans'' from a 1920 lexicon]]\n\nTsetse have an unusual [[Biological life cycle|lifecycle]] which may be due to the richness of their food source. A female fertilizes only one egg at a time and retains each egg within her uterus to have the offspring develop internally during the first three [[Instar|larval stages]], a method called [[adenotrophic viviparity]]. During this time, the female feeds the developing offspring with a milky substance secreted by a modified gland in the uterus.<ref>Geoffrey M. Attardoa, Claudia Lohs, Abdelaziz Heddi, Uzma H. Alama, Suleyman Yildirim, SerapAksoy: [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022191008001212 Analysis of milk gland structure and function in ''Glossina morsitans'': Milk protein production, symbiont populations and fecundity], in: Journal of Insect Physiology, Band 54, Nr.&nbsp;8, August 2008, S.&nbsp;1236-1242, [[doi:10.1016/j.jinsphys.2008.06.008]]</ref>\nIn the third larval stage, the tsetse larva leaves the uterus and begins its independent life. The newly independent tsetse larva crawls into the ground, and develops a hard outer shell called the puparial case, in which it completes its morphological transformation into an adult fly.\n\nThis lifestage has a variable duration, generally 20 to 30 days, and the larva must rely on stored resources during this time. The importance of the richness of blood to this development can be seen, since all tsetse development before it emerges from the puparial case as a full adult occurs without feeding, based only on nutritional resources provided by the female parent. The female must get enough energy for her needs, for the needs of her developing offspring, and for the stored resources which her offspring will require until it emerges as an adult.\n\nTechnically, these insects undergo the standard [[morphogenesis|development]] process of insects, which consists of [[oocyte]] formation, ovulation, fertilization, development of the egg, three [[larva]]l stages, a [[pupa]]l stage, and the emergence and maturation of the adult.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n===Genetics===\nThe genome of ''Glossina morsitans'' was sequenced in 2014.<ref>[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/344/6182/380 \"Genome sequence of the tsetse fly (Glossina morsitans): vector of African trypanosomiasis\"], Science. 2014 Apr 25; 344(6</ref>\n\n===Symbionts===\nTsetse flies have three known [[Endosymbiont|symbionts]].

In 1887, the rinderpest virus was accidentally imported in livestock brought by an Italian expeditionary force to Eritrea. It spread rapidly, reaching Ethiopia by 1888, the Atlantic coast by 1892 and South Africa by 1897. Rinderpest, a cattle plague from central Asia, killed over 90% of the cattle of the pastoral peoples such as the [[Maasai people|Masai]] of east Africa. With no native [[immunity (medical)|immunity]], most of the population \u2013 some 5.5 million cattle \u2013 died in southern Africa. Pastoralists were left with no animals - their source of income; and farmers were deprived of their working animals for ploughing and irrigation. The pandemic coincided with a period of drought, causing widespread famine. The starving human populations died of smallpox, cholera, typhoid and diseases imported from Europe. It's estimated that two-thirds of the Masai died in 1891. <ref name=Pearce2000>{{cite journal |last1=Pearce |first1=Fred |title=Inventing Africa |journal=New Scientist |date=12 August 2000 |volume=167 |issue=2251 |page=30 |url=http://www.faculty.umb.edu/pjt/pearce00.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe land was left emptied of its cattle and its people, enabling the colonial powers Germany and Britain to take over Tanzania and Kenya with little effort. With greatly reduced grazing, grassland turned rapidly to bush. The closely cropped grass sward was replaced in a few years by woody grassland and thornbush, ideal habitat for tsetse flies. Wild mammal populations increased rapidly, accompanied by the tsetse fly. [[Highland]] regions of east Africa which had been free of tsetse fly were colonised by the pest, accompanied by sleeping sickness, until then unknown in the area. Millions of people died of the disease in the early 20th century. <ref name=Pearce2000/>\n\n[[File:Masai Giraffe, Serengeti National Park, Tanzania (2010).jpg|thumb|[[Serengeti National Park]], Tanzania]]\n\nThe areas occupied by the tsetse fly were largely barred to [[animal husbandry]]. Sleeping sickness was dubbed \"the best game warden in Africa\" by conservationists, who assumed that the land, empty of people and full of game animals, had always been like that. [[Julian Huxley]] of the [[World Wildlife Fund]] called the plains of east Africa \"a surviving sector of the rich natural world as it was before the rise of modern man\". <ref name=Pearce2000/> They created numerous large reserves for hunting [[safari]]s. In 1909 the newly retired president [[Theodore Roosevelt]] went on a safari that brought over 10,000 animal carcasses to America. Later, much of the land was turned over to nature reserves and [[national parks]] such as the [[Serengeti]], [[Masai Mara]], [[Kruger Park|Kruger]] and [[Okavango Delta]]. The result, across eastern and southern Africa, is a modern landscape of manmade ecosystems: farmland and pastoral land largely free of bush and tsetse fly; and bush controlled by the tsetse fly. <ref name=Pearce2000/>\n\n===Situation===\n\nTsetse flies are regarded as a major cause of rural poverty in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] because they prevent mixed farming. The land infested with tsetse flies is often cultivated by people using hoes rather than more efficient draught animals because ''[[nagana]]'', the disease transmitted by tsetse, weakens and often kills these animals. Cattle that do survive produce little milk, pregnant cows often abort their calves, and manure is not available to fertilize the worn-out soils.\n[[File:Tsetse-BKF-2.jpg|right|thumb|Tsetse fly from Burkina Faso]]\n\nThe disease ''nagana'' or African [[animal trypanosomiasis]] (AAT) causes gradual health decline in infected livestock, reduces milk and meat production, and increases abortion rates.  Animals eventually succumb to the disease (annual cattle deaths caused by trypanosomiasis are estimated at 3 million). This has an enormous impact on the livelihood of farmers who live in tsetse-infested areas, as infected animals cannot be used to plough the land, and keeping cattle is only feasible when the animals are kept under constant [[prophylactic]] treatment with [[trypanocidal]] drugs, often with associated problems of drug resistance, counterfeited drugs, and suboptimal dosage. The overall annual direct lost potential in livestock and crop production was estimated at US$4.5 billion.<ref name=\"Budd, L 1999\">Budd, L. 1999.

Most of the 37 countries infested with tsetse are poor, debt-ridden and underdeveloped. Of the 39 tsetse-infested countries, 32 are [http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/lifdc/en/ low-income, food-deficit countries], 29 are [[least developed countries]], and 30 are among the 40 most [[heavily indebted poor countries]]. Eradicating the tsetse and trypanosomiasis (T&T) problem would allow rural Africans to use these areas for [[animal husbandry]] or the cultivation of crops and hence increase food production. Only 45 million cattle, of 172 million present in sub-Saharan Africa, are kept in tsetse-infested areas but are often forced into fragile ecosystems like highlands or the [[semiarid]] [[Sahel]] zone, which increases overgrazing and overuse of land for food production.\n\nIn addition to this direct impact, the presence of tsetse and trypanosomiasis discourages the use of more productive exotic and cross-bred cattle, depresses the growth and affects the distribution of livestock populations, reduces the potential opportunities for livestock and crop production (mixed farming) through less draught power to cultivate land and less manure to fertilize (in an environment-friendly way) soils for better crop production, and affects human settlements (people tend to avoid areas with tsetse flies).\n\nTsetse flies transmit a similar disease to humans, called [[African trypanosomiasis]] - human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) or sleeping sickness.

The name 'mechanical' reflects the similarity of this mode of transmission to mechanical injection with a [[syringe]]. Mechanical transmission requires the tsetse to feed on an infected host and acquire trypanosomes in the blood meal, and then, within a relatively short period, to feed on an uninfected host and regurgitate some of the infected blood from the first blood meal into the tissue of the uninfected animal. This type of transmission occurs most frequently when tsetse are interrupted during a blood meal and attempt to satiate themselves with another meal. Other flies, such as [[horse-fly|horse-flies]], can also cause mechanical transmission of trypanosomes.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Seasonal prevalence of bovine trypanosomosis in a tsetse-infested zone and a tsetse-free zone of the Amhara Region, north-west Ethiopia |journal=[[Onderstepoort Journal of Veterinary Research]] |year=2004 |volume=71 |issue=4 |pages=307\u201312 |author1=T.

The term 'biological' is used because trypanosomes must reproduce through several generations inside the tsetse host during the period of incubation, which requires extreme [[Adaptation (biology)|adaptation]] of the trypanosomes to their tsetse host. In this mode of transmission, trypanosomes reproduce through several generations, changing in morphology at certain periods. This mode of transmission also includes the sexual phase of the trypanosomes. Tsetse are believed to be more likely to become infected by trypanosomes during their first few blood meals. Tsetse infected by trypanosomes are thought to remain infected for the remainder of their lives. Because of the adaptations required for biological transmission, trypanosomes transmitted biologically by tsetse cannot be transmitted in this manner by other insects.\n\nThe relative importance of these two modes of transmission for the propagation of tsetse-vectored trypanosomiases is not yet well understood. However, since the sexual phase of the trypanosome lifecycle occurs within the tsetse host, biological transmission is a required step in the lifecycle of the tsetse-vectored trypanosomes.\n\nThe cycle of biological transmission of trypanosomiasis involves two phases, one inside the tsetse host and the other inside the vertebrate host. Trypanosomes are not passed between a pregnant tsetse and her offspring, so all newly emerged tsetse adults are free of infection. An uninfected fly that feeds on an infected vertebrate animal may acquire trypanosomes in its proboscis or gut. These trypanosomes, depending on the species, may remain in place, move to a different part of the digestive tract, or migrate through the tsetse body into the salivary glands. When an infected tsetse bites a susceptible host, the fly may regurgitate part of a previous blood meal that contains trypanosomes, or may inject trypanosomes in its saliva. Inoculation must contain a minimum of 300 to 450 individual trypanosomes to be successful, and may contain up to 40,000 cells.<ref name=\"Hoare\"/>\n\nThe trypanosomes are injected into vertebrate muscle tissue,{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} but make their way, first into the [[lymphatic system]], then into the bloodstream, and eventually into the brain. The disease causes the swelling of the lymph glands, emaciation of the body, and eventually leads to death. Uninfected tsetse may bite the infected animal prior to its death and acquire the disease, thereby closing the transmission cycle.\n\n===Disease hosts and vectors===\n\nThe tsetse-vectored trypanosomiases affect various vertebrate species including humans, antelopes, bovine cattle, camels, horses, sheep, goats, and pigs. These diseases are caused by several different trypanosome species that may also survive in wild animals such as crocodiles and monitor lizards. The diseases have different distributions across the African continent, so are transmitted by different species. This table summarizes this information:<ref name=\"Hoare\"/><ref>{{cite web |author=R.

This disease is invariably fatal unless treated but can almost always be cured with current medicines, if the disease is diagnosed early enough.\n\nSleeping sickness begins with a tsetse bite leading to an inoculation in the subcutaneous tissue. The infection moves into the [[lymphatic system]], leading to a characteristic swelling of the lymph glands called ''Winterbottom's sign''.<ref>[http://pathmicro.med.sc.edu/lecture/wint_sign.jpg]</ref> The infection progresses into the blood stream and eventually crosses into the [[central nervous system]] and invades the [[brain]] leading to extreme [[lethargy]] and eventually to [[death]].\n\nThe species ''Trypanosoma brucei'', which causes the disease, has often been subdivided into three subspecies that were identified based either on the vertebrate hosts which the strain could infect or on the virulence of the disease in humans. The trypanosomes infectious to animals and not to humans were named ''Trypanosoma brucei brucei''. Strains that infected humans were divided into two subspecies based on their different virulences: ''Trypanosoma brucei gambiense'' was thought to have a slower onset and ''Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense'' refers to strains with a more rapid, virulent onset. This characterization has always been problematic but was the best that could be done given the knowledge of the time and the tools available for identification. A recent molecular study using [[restriction fragment length polymorphism]] analysis suggests that the three subspecies are [[polyphyletic]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=G. Hide |year=1999 |title=History of Sleeping Sickness in East Africa |journal=[[Clinical Microbiology Reviews]] |volume=12 |pages=112\u2013125|doi=10.1128/CMR.12.1.112 |doi-access=free }}</ref> so the elucidation of the strains of ''T. brucei'' infective to humans requires a more complex explanation. [[Procyclin]]s are [[protein]]s developed in the surface coating of trypanosomes whilst in their tsetse fly vector.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.98.4.1513|pmid=11171982|title=The surface coat of procyclic Trypanosoma brucei: Programmed expression and proteolytic cleavage of procyclin in the tsetse fly|year=2001|last1=Acosta-Serrano|first1=A.|last2=Vassella|first2=E.|last3=Liniger|first3=M.|last4=Renggli|first4=C.

The most notable is American trypanosomiasis, known as [[Chagas disease]], which occurs in [[South America]], caused by ''Trypanosoma cruzi'', and transmitted by certain insects of the [[Reduviidae]], members of the [[Hemiptera]].\n\n===In domestic animals===\n{{main article|Animal trypanosomiasis}}\nAnimal [[trypanosomiasis]], also called ''nagana'' when it occurs in [[cattle|bovine cattle]] or [[horse]]s or ''sura'' when it occurs in domestic [[pig]]s, is caused by several trypanosome species. These [[disease]]s reduce the growth rate, [[milk]] productivity, and strength of [[farm]] animals, generally leading to the eventual [[death]] of the infected animals. Certain species of cattle are called ''trypanotolerant'' because they can survive and grow even when infected with trypanosomes although they also have lower productivity rates when infected.\n\nThe course of the disease in animals is similar to the course of [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]] in humans.\n\n''Trypanosoma congolense'' and ''Trypanosoma vivax'' are the two most important species infecting bovine cattle in [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. ''Trypanosoma simiae'' causes a virulent disease in [[swine]].\n\nOther forms of animal trypanosomiasis are also known from other areas of the globe, caused by different species of trypanosomes and transmitted without the intervention of the tsetse fly.\n\nThe tsetse fly vector ranges mostly in the central part of Africa.\n\n[[Trypanosomiasis]] poses a considerable constraint on livestock agricultural development in Tsetse fly infested areas of sub Saharan Africa, especially in west and central Africa. International research conducted by [[ILRI]] in [[Nigeria]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[Kenya]] has shown that the [[N'Dama]] is the most resistant breed. \u00a0<ref>http://www.fao.org/3/y5832e/y5832e05.htm</ref> <ref>https://www.slideshare.net/mobile/ILRI/animal-genetic-resources-characterization-and-conservation-research-in-africa-an-overview</ref>\n\n==Control==\nThe conquest of [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]] and [[nagana]] would be of immense benefit to rural development and contribute to poverty alleviation and improved food security in sub-Saharan Africa. Human African trypanosomosis ('''HAT''') and animal African trypanosomosis ('''AAT''') are sufficiently important to make virtually any intervention against these diseases beneficial.<ref>FAO. 2003. Economic guidelines for strategic planning of tsetse and trypanosomiasis control in West Africa, by A.P.M. Shaw. PAAT Technical and Scientific Series No. 5. Rome.</ref>\n[[File:Tsetse-BKF-3.jpg|right|thumb|Tsetse fly from Burkina Faso]]\nThe disease can be managed by controlling the vector and thus reducing the incidence of the disease by disrupting the transmission cycle. Another tactic to manage the disease is to target the disease directly using surveillance and [[curative care|curative]] or [[prophylactic]] treatments to reduce the number of hosts that carry the disease.\n\nEconomic analysis indicates that the cost of managing [[trypanosomosis]] through the elimination of important populations of major tsetse vectors will be covered several times by the benefits of tsetse-free status.<ref name=\"Budd, L 1999\"/> Area-wide interventions against the tsetse and trypanosomosis problem appear more efficient and profitable if sufficiently large areas, with high numbers of cattle, can be covered.\n\nVector control strategies can aim at either continuous [[Pest control|suppression or eradication]] of target populations. Tsetse fly eradication programmes are complex and logistically demanding activities and usually involve the integration of different control tactics, such as [[trypanocidal]] drugs, [[impregnated treated targets]] (ITT), [[insecticide-treated cattle]] (ITC), [[aerial spraying]] ([[Sequential Aerosol Technique]] - SAT) and in some situations the release of sterile males ([[sterile insect technique]] \u2013 SIT). To ensure sustainability of the results, it is critical to apply the control tactics on an '''area-wide basis''', i.e. '''targeting an entire tsetse population''' that is preferably [[genetically isolated]].\n\n===Control techniques===\nMany techniques have reduced tsetse populations, with earlier, crude methods recently replaced by methods that are cheaper, more directed, and ecologically better.\n\n====Slaughter of wild animals====\nOne early technique involved slaughtering all the wild animals tsetse fed on. For example, the island of [[Principe]] off the west coast of Africa was entirely cleared of [[feral]] pigs in the 1930s, which led to the [[Local extinction|extirpation]] of the fly. While the fly eventually re-invaded in the 1950s, the new population of tsetse was free from the disease.'''\n\n====Land clearing====\nAnother early technique involved complete removal of brush and woody vegetation from an area. Tsetse tend to rest on the trunks of trees so removing woody vegetation made the area inhospitable to the flies. However, the technique was not widely used and has been abandoned. Preventing regrowth of woody vegetation requires continuous clearing efforts, which is only practical where large human populations are present. The clearing of woody vegetation has come to be seen as an environmental problem more than a benefit.\n\n====Pesticide campaigns====\n[[Pesticides]] have been used to control tsetse starting initially during the early part of the twentieth century in localized efforts using the inorganic metal-based pesticides, expanding after the Second World War into massive aerial- and ground-based campaigns with organochlorine pesticides such as [[DDT]] applied as [[aerosol]] sprays at [[Ultra-Low Volume]] rates.  Later, more targeted techniques used ''pour-on'' [[pesticide formulation|formulations]] in which advanced organic pesticides were applied directly to the backs of cattle.\n\n====Trapping====\n[[Image:TsetseTrap.jpg|right|thumb|Tsetse trap]]\nTsetse populations can be monitored and effectively controlled using simple, inexpensive traps. These often use electric blue cloth, since this color attracts the flies. Early traps mimicked the form of cattle but this seems unnecessary and recent traps are simple sheets or have a biconical form. The traps can kill by channeling the flies into a collection chamber or by exposing the flies to insecticide sprayed on the cloth. Tsetse are also attracted to large dark colors like the hides of cow and buffaloes. Some scientists put forward the idea that [[zebra]] have stripes, not as a camouflage in long grass, but because the black and white bands tend to confuse tsetse and prevent attack.<ref>{{cite news|last=Doyle-Burr|first=Nora|title=Scientists unravel mystery of zebra stripes|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2012/0209/Scientists-unravel-mystery-of-zebra-stripes|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=May 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1242/jeb.065540| title = Polarotactic tabanids find striped patterns with brightness and/or polarization modulation least attractive: An advantage of zebra stripes| journal = Journal of Experimental Biology| volume = 215| issue = 5| pages = 736\u2013745| year = 2012| last1 = Egri | first1 = A.| last2 = Blaho | first2 = M.| last3 = Kriska | first3 = G.| last4 = Farkas | first4 = R.| last5 = Gyurkovszky | first5 = M.| last6 = Akesson | first6 = S.| last7 = Horvath | first7 = G. | pmid=22323196| doi-access = free}}</ref>\n\nThe use of chemicals as attractants to lure tsetse to the traps has been studied extensively in the late 20th century, but this has mostly been of interest to scientists rather than as an economically reasonable solution. Attractants studied have been those tsetse might use to find food, like carbon dioxide, octenol, and acetone&mdash;which are given off in animals' breath and distributed downwind in an ''odor plume.'' Synthetic versions of these chemicals can create artificial odor plumes. A cheaper approach is to place cattle urine in a half gourd near the trap. For large trapping efforts, additional traps are generally cheaper than expensive artificial attractants.\n\nA special trapping method is applied in Ethiopia, where the BioFarm Consortium (ICIPE, BioVision Foundation, BEA, Helvetas, DLCO-EA, [[Praxis Ethiopia]]) applies the traps in a sustainable agriculture and rural development context (SARD). The traps are just the entry point, followed by improved farming, human health and marketing inputs. This method is in the final stage of testing (as per 2006).\n\n====Sterile insect technique====\nThe [[sterile insect technique]] ('''SIT''') is a form of pest control that uses [[ionizing radiation]] ([[gamma ray]] or [[X ray]]) to sterilize male flies that are mass-produced in special rearing facilities. The sterile males are released systematically from the ground or by air in tsetse-infested areas, where they mate with wild females, which do not produce offspring. As a result, this technique can eventually eradicate populations of wild flies. SIT is among the most [[environmentally friendly]] control tactics available, and is usually applied as the final component of an integrated campaign. It has been used to subdue the populations of many other fly species including the medfly, [[Ceratitis capitata|''Ceratitis Capitata'']].\n\nThe sustainable removal of the tsetse fly is in many cases the most cost-effective way of dealing with the T&T problem resulting in major economic benefits for subsistence farmers in rural areas. Insecticide-based methods are normally very ineffective in removing the last remnants of tsetse populations, while, on the contrary, sterile males are very effective in finding and mating the last remaining females. Therefore, the integration of the SIT as the last component of an area-wide integrated approach is essential in many situations to achieve complete eradication of the different tsetse populations, particularly in areas of more dense vegetation.\n\nA project that was implemented from 1994 to 1997 on the Island of [[Unguja]], [[Zanzibar]] (United Republic of [[Tanzania]]), demonstrated that, after suppression of the tsetse population with insecticides, SIT completely removed the ''[[Glossina austeni]]'' Newstead population from the Island (<ref>Vreysen, M.J.B., Saleh, K.M., Ali, M.Y., Abdulla, A.M., Zhu, Z.-R., Juma, K.G., Dyck, V.A., Msangi, A.R., Mkonyi, P.A., Feldmann, H.U., 2000. Glossina austeni (Diptera: Glossinidae ) eradicated on the island of Unguja, Zanzibar, using the sterile insect technique. J. Econ. Entomol. 93, 123\u2013135</ref>).  The eradication of the tsetse fly from Unguja Island in 1997 was followed by the disappearance of the AAT which enabled farmers to integrate livestock keeping with cropping in areas where this had been impossible before. The increased livestock and crop productivity and the possibility of using animals for transport and traction significantly contributed to an increase in the quality of people's lives (<ref>Tambi, E.N., Maina, O.W., Mukhebi, A.W. & Randolph, T.F. 1999.

Feasibility studies indicated that the fly population was confined to very fragmented habitats and a population genetics study indicated that the population was genetically isolated from the main tsetse belt in the south eastern part of Senegal. After completion of the feasibility studies (2006\u20132010), an area-wide integrated eradication campaign that included an SIT component was started in 2011, and by 2015, the Niayes region had become almost tsetse fly free.<ref>IAEA 2015.

The prevalence of AAT has decreased from 40-50% before the project started to less than 10% to date in blocks 1 and 2. Although insecticides are being used for fly suppression, they are applied for short periods on traps, nets and livestock, and are not spread into the environment. After the suppression activities are completed, no more insecticide is applied in the area. The removal of trypanosomosis will eliminate the need for constant prophylactic treatments of the cattle with trypanocidal drugs, therefore reducing [[residue (chemistry)|residue]]s of these drugs in the [[Feces|dung]], meat and milk.\n\nThe main beneficiaries of the project are the many small holder farmers, the larger commercial farms and the consumers of meat and milk.

In addition, it is expected that the number of cattle will be reduced by 45%, which will result in reduced environmental impacts.\n\n==Effect on societal development==\n\nIn the literature of [[environmental determinism]], the tsetse has been linked to difficulties during early [[state formation]] for areas where the fly is prevalent. A 2012 study used population growth models, physiological data, and ethnographic data to examine pre-colonial agricultural practices and isolate the effects of the fly. A \"tsetse suitability index\" was developed from insect population growth, climate and geospatial data to simulate the fly's population steady state. An increase in the tsetse suitability index was associated with a statistically significant weakening of the agriculture, levels of urbanization, institutions and subsistence strategies. Results suggest that the tsetse decimated livestock populations, forcing early states to rely on slave labor to clear land for farming, and preventing farmers from taking advantage of natural animal fertilizers to increase crop production. These long-term effects may have kept population density low and discouraged cooperation between small-scale communities, thus preventing stronger nations from forming.\n\nThe authors also suggest that under a lower burden of tsetse, Africa would have developed differently. Agriculture (measured by the usage of large domesticated animals, intensive agriculture, plow use and female participation rate in agriculture) as well as institutions (measured by the appearance of indigenous slavery and levels of centralization) would have been more like those found in Eurasia. Qualitative support for this claim comes from archaeological findings; e.g., [[Great Zimbabwe]] is located in the African highlands where the fly does not occur, and represented the largest and technically most advanced precolonial structure in sub-Sahara Africa.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Alsan|first1=Marcella|title=The Effect of the Tsetse fly on African Development|journal=American Economic Review|date=January 2015|volume=105|issue=105|pages=382\u2013410|doi=10.1257/aer.20130604|url=http://healthpolicy.fsi.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/tsetse.pdf}}</ref>\n\nOther authors are more skeptical that the Tsetse fly had such an immense influence on African development. One conventional argument is that the Tsetse fly made it difficult to use draught animals. Hence, wheeled forms of transportations were not used as well. While this is certainly true for areas with high densities of the fly, similar cases outside tsetse-suitable areas exist. While the fly definitely had a relevant influence on the adaption of new technologies in Africa, it has been contested that it does not represent the single root cause.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chaves|first=Isa\u00edas|last2=Engerman|first2=Stanley|last3=Robinson|first3=James|date=2013|title=Reinventing the Wheel: The Economic Benefits of Wheeled Transportation in Early British Colonial West Africa|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w19673.pdf|language=en|location=Cambridge, MA|doi=10.3386/w19673}}</ref>\n\n==''T. brucei'' sexual cycle==\n\n[[Trypanosoma brucei|''T. brucei'']] are able to undergo meiotic [[sexual reproduction]].

[[American Film Institute]]. Retrieved November 27, 2013.</ref>\n\nThe film was released on October 15, 1993, by [[TriStar Pictures]]. It stars [[Sean Astin]] as the title character, along with [[Ned Beatty]], [[Jason Miller (playwright)|Jason Miller]] and [[Charles S. Dutton]]. The Film had supporting roles from [[Jon Favreau]] and [[Vince Vaughn]]. The script was written by [[Angelo Pizzo]], who created ''[[Hoosiers (film)|Hoosiers]]'' (1986), which was also directed by Anspaugh. The film was shot in [[Illinois]] and [[Indiana]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn late 1960s [[Joliet, Illinois]], Daniel Eugene \"Rudy\" Ruettiger dreams of playing football at [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]], but lacks the grades and money to attend, and the talent and physical stature to play major [[college football]]. Following high school, he works at a steel mill with his father, a Notre Dame fan, and his older brothers. When his supportive best friend Pete is killed in a mill explosion, Rudy decides to follow his dream.\n\nIn 1972, Rudy visits Notre Dame but is not academically eligible to enroll. With the help of priest Father Cavanaugh, Rudy enrolls at nearby [[Holy Cross College (Indiana)|Holy Cross College]], hoping to transfer. He approaches Fortune, head groundskeeper at Notre Dame stadium, and is given a job. Homeless, Rudy sneaks into Fortune's office through a window to sleep on a cot; initially indifferent, Fortune later provides him with blankets and a key to the office. Rudy learns Fortune, despite working at the stadium for years, has never seen a Notre Dame football game.\n\nRudy befriends [[teaching assistant]] D-Bob, who has him tested; Rudy is diagnosed with [[dyslexia]], overcoming his disability to become a better student. At Christmas, Rudy returns home to his family's appreciation of his college academic achievements, but is still mocked for his attempts to play college football and loses his fianc\u00e9e to his older brother. It doesn't deter him. \n\nAfter two years at Holy Cross and three rejections from Notre Dame, Rudy is finally admitted and attends football tryouts in an attempt to make the team as a [[Walk-on (sports)|\"walk-on\"]]. Assistant coach Yonto warns the walk-ons that thirty-five scholarship players will not even make the \"dress roster\" of players who take the field during games, but notices Rudy\u2019s determination and gives him a spot on the daily practice squad. Rudy tells Fortune and persuades him to promise to see his first game. Competing well during practices, Rudy convinces head coach [[Ara Parseghian]] to let him suit up for one home game in his senior year, but Coach Parseghian retires following the [[1974 NCAA Division I football season|1974 season]] and is replaced by former [[National Football League|NFL]] coach [[Dan Devine]], who refuses to place Rudy on the game day roster. Frustrated that he is not on the dress list for the next-to-last home game, Rudy quits the team.\n\nFortune finds a distraught Rudy and reveals that he actually played for Notre Dame years earlier, but quit when he felt he was being kept from playing due to his skin color and has regretted it ever since. Reminded that he has nothing to prove to anyone but himself and will forever regret quitting, Rudy returns to the team. In a famous scene, each of his fellow seniors, led by [[Captain (sports)|team captain]] and [[All-America]]n Roland Steele, lines up to lay his jersey on Devine's desk and requests that Rudy be allowed to dress in his place for the season's final game. Devine lets Rudy suit up against [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]].\n\nWith Rudy's family and D-Bob in attendance, Steele invites Rudy to lead the team onto the field, and Fortune is there to see the game as promised. With Notre Dame leading 17\u20133, Devine sends all the seniors into the game except Rudy, despite Steele and the assistant coaches\u2019 urging. Fans are aware of Rudy\u2019s goal from a story in the student newspaper, and a \"Rudy!\" chant begins in the stadium. Hearing this, the Notre Dame offensive team, led by [[Halfback (American football)|tailback]] Jamie O'Hara, overrules Devine's call for [[Quarterback kneel|victory formation]] and scores a quick touchdown, providing defensive player Rudy a chance to get in the game and be entered onto the [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Fighting Irish]] roster.\n\nDevine finally lets Rudy play on the Notre Dame kickoff to Georgia Tech. Rudy stays in for the final play and sacks the Georgia Tech quarterback, and is carried on his teammates' shoulders to cheers from the stadium.\n\nAn epilogue states that after 1975, no other player for Notre Dame had been carried off the field to the time of the film's release in 1993.{{refn|name=Update|group=N|In 1995, fullback [[Marc Edwards (American football)|Marc Edwards]] became the second Notre Dame player carried off the field by his teammates following their upset win over the [[University of Southern California Trojans football|USC Trojans]].}} Rudy graduated in 1976 and all his younger brothers went on to earn college degrees.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Sean Astin]] as [[Daniel Ruettiger|Daniel Ruettiger]]\n*[[Jon Favreau]] as Dennis \"D-Bob\" McGowan\n*[[Ned Beatty]] as Daniel Ruettiger, Sr.\n*[[Charles S.

Rudy stays in for the final play and sacks the Georgia Tech quarterback, and is carried on his teammates' shoulders to cheers from the stadium.\n\nAn epilogue states that after 1975, no other player for Notre Dame had been carried off the field to the time of the film's release in 1993.{{refn|name=Update|group=N|In 1995, fullback [[Marc Edwards (American football)|Marc Edwards]] became the second Notre Dame player carried off the field by his teammates following their upset win over the [[University of Southern California Trojans football|USC Trojans]].}} Rudy graduated in 1976 and all his younger brothers went on to earn college degrees.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Sean Astin]] as [[Daniel Ruettiger|Daniel Ruettiger]]\n*[[Jon Favreau]] as Dennis \"D-Bob\" McGowan\n*[[Ned Beatty]] as Daniel Ruettiger, Sr.\n*[[Charles S.
