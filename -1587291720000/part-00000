This was planned as a quick commando raid to capture the top LTTE leadership and local commanders who, according to Indian intelligence, were supposed to be in the building at the time and was thus expected to cut short the battle for Jaffna.<ref name=BSJUHD>[http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/History/1987IPKF/Chapter3.html \"Descent Into Danger.

A second wave was to follow with a platoon (30 troops) from the 13th battalion of the Sikh Light Infantry. The heliborne troops were to link up with the 4th battalion of [[5 Gorkha Rifles (Frontier Force)]] of 72 Brigade and the Sikh Light Infantry troops advancing on the ground.<ref name=BSOPPAW/>\n\nThe operation ended in disaster as the LTTE, having intercepted IPKF radio transmissions, set up an ambush. The helidropped troops came under intense fire from LTTE positions, forcing the [[Mil Mi-8]] helicopters to abandon the insertion midway through the operation. During the ensuing battle, which lasted throughout the night, 29 of the 30 Sikh Light Infantry troops and 2 of the 17 commandos were killed before detachments of the [[65th Armoured Regiment (India)|65th Armoured Regiment]] were able to extract the commandos from their defensive positions.<ref name= BS/> After the Sikh Light Infantry platoon's [[signaller]] was shot by LTTE snipers early on in the battle, the unit lost contact with the Indian High Command at [[Palay Air Base]]. The sole survivor of the platoon, Sepoy Gora Singh, was taken prisoner by the LTTE under the command of Pawan Kashyap. It was not until his subsequent release during the conflict that the fate of the unit was known.<ref name=BS/>\n\n===Battle for Jaffna===\nAs the battle for Jaffna progressed, the IPKF advance came under intense and vicious opposition from the Tigers. Fighting in built-up and an as-yet unevacuated Jaffna, the Indian High Command insisted that the slow advance was, in addition to Tiger resistance, more a result of reluctance on the part of the IPKF to use heavy weaponry to clear LTTE defenses.<ref name=Dagmar/> Furthermore, all the approach roads had been laced with Claymore mines or explosives by the Tigers in its years of fighting with the Sri Lankan army.<ref name=BSOPPAW/> The Tigers also made extensive use of [[Improvised explosive device|IED]]s (improvised explosive devices)<ref name=BSOPPAW/> which could be remotely detonated from over a kilometer away. During this time Eastern Command of the [[Indian Navy]], supported by the [[Indian Coast Guard|Coast Guard]], was key in establishing a {{convert|300|mi|km}} long blockade around northern Sri Lanka from October 1987 to disrupt the Tigers' supply and communication routes.<ref name=Navy>{{cite web|url=http://indiannavy.nic.in/pawan.htm |accessdate=1 February 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051001130821/http://indiannavy.nic.in/pawan.htm |archivedate=1 October 2005 }}</ref> It was at about this time that the [[MARCOS]] forces (Marine Commandos) of the Indian Navy first went into action. Detachments of the IMSF (Indian Marine Special Forces, as the MARCOS was then known), along with a battalion of the 340th Independent Brigade of the [[Indian Army]], provided beach [[reconnaissance]] around Jaffna and [[Batticaloa]].\nThe 340th Brigade was one of the first IPKF units to be deployed, and served until operations in the [[Trincomalee]] area were complete. The IMSF, at this time, also provided security patrols along the coast road west of Jaffna until the 41st Brigade took charge in November.\n\nOn 15/16 October the IPKF stopped its advance to stabilize the front. Palay, the major operations headquarters for the [[54th Infantry Division (India)|54th Infantry Division]], was also secured from Tiger attacks. At this time the [[Indian Air Force]] undertook a massive airlift to reinforce the 91st with three brigades and heavy equipment, including [[T-72]] tanks and [[BMP-1|BMP-1 fighting vehicles]]. Air traffic controllers worked round the clock to fly in troops and equipment. [[Indian Airlines]] is said to have contributed to the airlift, using its [[Boeing 737]]s to deliver troops.<ref name=BSOPPAW/> This short interval also saw the introduction of [[Mil Mi-8|Mi-8]] medium helicopters and the first use of the [[Mi-25]] gunships of [[No. 125 Sqn]], along with [[HAL Cheetah]] light helicopters. By end of October the IAF had flown 2200 tactical transport and 800 helicopter sorties.<ref name=BSOPPAW/>\n\nNow reinforced, the IPKF resumed the battle for Jaffna. The tanks and armored fighting vehicles are said to have been effective protection against [[anti-personnel mine]]s.<ref name=BSOPPAW/> However, even with this defense the IPKF advance was torturous in the face of the Tigers' sniper fire. They would take up positions on rooftops, in trees and even in [[coconut]] [[Arecaceae|palm]]s. Equipped with powerful [[Telescopic sight|telescopic infra-red sight]]s, they were able to selectively take out officers and radiomen, inflicting a heavy toll and bringing the advance to a grinding halt. Helicopters flying below 2000 feet were also vulnerable, with at least five being shot at and damaged before the Mi-25s took up their offensive role. The IPKF adapted quickly, with its officers taking off the pips of their ranks, wearing [[slouch hat]]s and carrying oversize back packs. However, as the advance got bogged down, the battalions, instead of maneuvering around the defenders, were forced to commit more troops under orders from [[New Delhi]].<ref name=BSOPPAW/>  In addition, the LTTE increasingly began to deploy [[anti-tank mine]]s, taking a further heavy toll on IPKF forces. A frustrated IPKF cut off the power to Jaffna in an attempt to counter this.<ref name=BSOPPAW/> IPKF communication lines were extensively mined by the LTTE, which further compounded the sometimes perilous situations that the Indian troops faced. It was not before the IMSF commandos broke out of the besieged Jaffna port and cleared the heavily mined Navanturai Coastal Road that a crucial link-up between 1 [[Maratha Light Infantry]] in Jaffna fort and the advancing troops of 41st Brigade could be established that secured the Nallur area.<ref name=BSOPPAW/> On 21 October the commandos conducted a successful amphibious raid against an LTTE base at [[Guru Nagar]].<ref name=\"SpecOps\">[http://www.specialoperations.com/Foreign/India/MCF.htm India.

The IPKF also came face-to-face with [[child soldier]]s of the LTTE, something it had not expected.<ref name=BSOPPAW/>\n\nThis was only the beginning of the IPKF's three-year campaign to neutralize the LTTE. By the time Jaffna fell, the LTTE had merely exfiltrated out of the town, moving south to the jungles of [[Vavuniya]]. Its hardcore fighters moved to the safety of the jungle by skirting the Jaffna coast from Point Pedro to Elephant Pass, sheltered by the criss-cross of waterways in the impenetrable Nittkaikulam jungle. In the Jaffna sector, although the LTTE had shifted out of the town itself, it nevertheless harassed the 54th Division's efforts to consolidate its positions using IEDs and anti-personnel mines. In turn, the IPKF was able to disrupt the LTTE's activities with regular raids that led to the capture of large caches of rebel weaponry.<ref name=BSJUNG/> Brig. Manjit Singh was later replaced by Brig. J.S. Dhillon, under whom the 54th underwent considerable modifications of its operations routine. Small, highly mobile units became the staple of the 54th's operations.<ref name=BSJUNG/>\n\nThe IPKF at this point still consisted mostly of an overstretched 54th Division. Following the Jaffna operation, the 36th Infantry Division, along with two additional brigades, took over the [[Vavuniya]] sector and the [[Trincomalee]]-[[Batticaloa]] axis. This relieved the 54th Division which, led by Brig. Singh, could now focus on consolidating the Jaffna sector.<ref name=BSJUNG>[http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/LAND-FORCES/Army/History/1987/Chapter04.html \"Shifting to the Jungles\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207042557/http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/LAND-FORCES/Army/History/1987/Chapter04.html |date=2006-12-07 }} Bharat-rakshak.com</ref> The 4th Mountain Division and the 57th Infantry Division were deployed still later in February 1988 to take charge of [[Vanni (Sri Lanka)|Vanni]] and Batticaloa from the 36th.\n\n==Criticism==\nIndia's foreign intelligence agency [[Research and Analysis Wing]] trained the [[LTTE]] to keep a check on [[Sri Lanka]], which had helped Pakistan in the [[Indo-Pakistani wars and conflicts|Indo-Pak War]] by allowing Pakistani ships to refuel at Sri Lankan ports. When Prime Minister of India [[Rajiv Gandhi]] sent the [[Indian Peace Keeping Force]] (IPKF) in 1987 to restore normalcy in the region, the disastrous efforts of the IPKF was blamed on the lack of co-ordination between the IPKF and RAW. Its most obvious manifestation was the [[Jaffna University Helidrop|Heliborne assault on LTTE HQ]] in the [[Jaffna University]] campus in the opening stages of Operation Pawan. The site was chosen without any consultation with the RAW and the dropping [[paratroopers]] became easy targets for the LTTE, and a number of Indian soldiers were killed. The [[assassination of Rajiv Gandhi]] is also blamed as a fallout of operation Pawan in Sri Lanka.<ref>Sachi Sri Kantha.

This was planned as a quick commando raid to capture the top LTTE leadership and local commanders who, according to Indian intelligence, were supposed to be in the building at the time and was thus expected to cut short the battle for Jaffna.<ref name=BSJUHD>[http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/History/1987IPKF/Chapter3.html \"Descent Into Danger. The Jaffna University Helidrop\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609123127/http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/History/1987IPKF/Chapter3.html |date=2011-06-09 }} Bharat-rakshak.com</ref> The plan was to land 17 commandos from the 10th battalion of the [[Parachute Regiment (India)|Parachute Regiment]] to secure the football field. A second wave was to follow with a platoon (30 troops) from the 13th battalion of the Sikh Light Infantry. The heliborne troops were to link up with the 4th battalion of [[5 Gorkha Rifles (Frontier Force)]] of 72 Brigade and the Sikh Light Infantry troops advancing on the ground.<ref name=BSOPPAW/>\n\nThe operation ended in disaster as the LTTE, having intercepted IPKF radio transmissions, set up an ambush. The helidropped troops came under intense fire from LTTE positions, forcing the [[Mil Mi-8]] helicopters to abandon the insertion midway through the operation. During the ensuing battle, which lasted throughout the night, 29 of the 30 Sikh Light Infantry troops and 2 of the 17 commandos were killed before detachments of the [[65th Armoured Regiment (India)|65th Armoured Regiment]] were able to extract the commandos from their defensive positions.<ref name= BS/> After the Sikh Light Infantry platoon's [[signaller]] was shot by LTTE snipers early on in the battle, the unit lost contact with the Indian High Command at [[Palay Air Base]]. The sole survivor of the platoon, Sepoy Gora Singh, was taken prisoner by the LTTE under the command of Pawan Kashyap. It was not until his subsequent release during the conflict that the fate of the unit was known.<ref name=BS/>\n\n===Battle for Jaffna===\nAs the battle for Jaffna progressed, the IPKF advance came under intense and vicious opposition from the Tigers. Fighting in built-up and an as-yet unevacuated Jaffna, the Indian High Command insisted that the slow advance was, in addition to Tiger resistance, more a result of reluctance on the part of the IPKF to use heavy weaponry to clear LTTE defenses.<ref name=Dagmar/> Furthermore, all the approach roads had been laced with Claymore mines or explosives by the Tigers in its years of fighting with the Sri Lankan army.<ref name=BSOPPAW/> The Tigers also made extensive use of [[Improvised explosive device|IED]]s (improvised explosive devices)<ref name=BSOPPAW/> which could be remotely detonated from over a kilometer away. During this time Eastern Command of the [[Indian Navy]], supported by the [[Indian Coast Guard|Coast Guard]], was key in establishing a {{convert|300|mi|km}} long blockade around northern Sri Lanka from October 1987 to disrupt the Tigers' supply and communication routes.<ref name=Navy>{{cite web|url=http://indiannavy.nic.in/pawan.htm |accessdate=1 February 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051001130821/http://indiannavy.nic.in/pawan.htm |archivedate=1 October 2005 }}</ref> It was at about this time that the [[MARCOS]] forces (Marine Commandos) of the Indian Navy first went into action. Detachments of the IMSF (Indian Marine Special Forces, as the MARCOS was then known), along with a battalion of the 340th Independent Brigade of the [[Indian Army]], provided beach [[reconnaissance]] around Jaffna and [[Batticaloa]].\nThe 340th Brigade was one of the first IPKF units to be deployed, and served until operations in the [[Trincomalee]] area were complete. The IMSF, at this time, also provided security patrols along the coast road west of Jaffna until the 41st Brigade took charge in November.\n\nOn 15/16 October the IPKF stopped its advance to stabilize the front. Palay, the major operations headquarters for the [[54th Infantry Division (India)|54th Infantry Division]], was also secured from Tiger attacks. At this time the [[Indian Air Force]] undertook a massive airlift to reinforce the 91st with three brigades and heavy equipment, including [[T-72]] tanks and [[BMP-1|BMP-1 fighting vehicles]]. Air traffic controllers worked round the clock to fly in troops and equipment. [[Indian Airlines]] is said to have contributed to the airlift, using its [[Boeing 737]]s to deliver troops.<ref name=BSOPPAW/> This short interval also saw the introduction of [[Mil Mi-8|Mi-8]] medium helicopters and the first use of the [[Mi-25]] gunships of [[No. 125 Sqn]], along with [[HAL Cheetah]] light helicopters. By end of October the IAF had flown 2200 tactical transport and 800 helicopter sorties.<ref name=BSOPPAW/>\n\nNow reinforced, the IPKF resumed the battle for Jaffna. The tanks and armored fighting vehicles are said to have been effective protection against [[anti-personnel mine]]s.<ref name=BSOPPAW/> However, even with this defense the IPKF advance was torturous in the face of the Tigers' sniper fire. They would take up positions on rooftops, in trees and even in [[coconut]] [[Arecaceae|palm]]s. Equipped with powerful [[Telescopic sight|telescopic infra-red sight]]s, they were able to selectively take out officers and radiomen, inflicting a heavy toll and bringing the advance to a grinding halt. Helicopters flying below 2000 feet were also vulnerable, with at least five being shot at and damaged before the Mi-25s took up their offensive role. The IPKF adapted quickly, with its officers taking off the pips of their ranks, wearing [[slouch hat]]s and carrying oversize back packs. However, as the advance got bogged down, the battalions, instead of maneuvering around the defenders, were forced to commit more troops under orders from [[New Delhi]].<ref name=BSOPPAW/>  In addition, the LTTE increasingly began to deploy [[anti-tank mine]]s, taking a further heavy toll on IPKF forces. A frustrated IPKF cut off the power to Jaffna in an attempt to counter this.<ref name=BSOPPAW/> IPKF communication lines were extensively mined by the LTTE, which further compounded the sometimes perilous situations that the Indian troops faced. It was not before the IMSF commandos broke out of the besieged Jaffna port and cleared the heavily mined Navanturai Coastal Road that a crucial link-up between 1 [[Maratha Light Infantry]] in Jaffna fort and the advancing troops of 41st Brigade could be established that secured the Nallur area.<ref name=BSOPPAW/> On 21 October the commandos conducted a successful amphibious raid against an LTTE base at [[Guru Nagar]].<ref name=\"SpecOps\">[http://www.specialoperations.com/Foreign/India/MCF.htm India.

The IPKF also came face-to-face with [[child soldier]]s of the LTTE, something it had not expected.<ref name=BSOPPAW/>\n\nThis was only the beginning of the IPKF's three-year campaign to neutralize the LTTE. By the time Jaffna fell, the LTTE had merely exfiltrated out of the town, moving south to the jungles of [[Vavuniya]]. Its hardcore fighters moved to the safety of the jungle by skirting the Jaffna coast from Point Pedro to Elephant Pass, sheltered by the criss-cross of waterways in the impenetrable Nittkaikulam jungle. In the Jaffna sector, although the LTTE had shifted out of the town itself, it nevertheless harassed the 54th Division's efforts to consolidate its positions using IEDs and anti-personnel mines. In turn, the IPKF was able to disrupt the LTTE's activities with regular raids that led to the capture of large caches of rebel weaponry.<ref name=BSJUNG/> Brig. Manjit Singh was later replaced by Brig. J.S. Dhillon, under whom the 54th underwent considerable modifications of its operations routine. Small, highly mobile units became the staple of the 54th's operations.<ref name=BSJUNG/>\n\nThe IPKF at this point still consisted mostly of an overstretched 54th Division. Following the Jaffna operation, the 36th Infantry Division, along with two additional brigades, took over the [[Vavuniya]] sector and the [[Trincomalee]]-[[Batticaloa]] axis. This relieved the 54th Division which, led by Brig. Singh, could now focus on consolidating the Jaffna sector.<ref name=BSJUNG>[http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/LAND-FORCES/Army/History/1987/Chapter04.html \"Shifting to the Jungles\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207042557/http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/LAND-FORCES/Army/History/1987/Chapter04.html |date=2006-12-07 }} Bharat-rakshak.com</ref> The 4th Mountain Division and the 57th Infantry Division were deployed still later in February 1988 to take charge of [[Vanni (Sri Lanka)|Vanni]] and Batticaloa from the 36th.\n\n==Criticism==\nIndia's foreign intelligence agency [[Research and Analysis Wing]] trained the [[LTTE]] to keep a check on [[Sri Lanka]], which had helped Pakistan in the [[Indo-Pakistani wars and conflicts|Indo-Pak War]] by allowing Pakistani ships to refuel at Sri Lankan ports. When Prime Minister of India [[Rajiv Gandhi]] sent the [[Indian Peace Keeping Force]] (IPKF) in 1987 to restore normalcy in the region, the disastrous efforts of the IPKF was blamed on the lack of co-ordination between the IPKF and RAW. Its most obvious manifestation was the [[Jaffna University Helidrop|Heliborne assault on LTTE HQ]] in the [[Jaffna University]] campus in the opening stages of Operation Pawan. The site was chosen without any consultation with the RAW and the dropping [[paratroopers]] became easy targets for the LTTE, and a number of Indian soldiers were killed. The [[assassination of Rajiv Gandhi]] is also blamed as a fallout of operation Pawan in Sri Lanka.<ref>Sachi Sri Kantha.
