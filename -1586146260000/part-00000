They were inspired to lead a life of renunciation.\n\nBrahmacharini Asha had in 1946 written an article entitled, ''\u2018Hindu Women\u2019s Right to Sannyasa\u2019'' published in [[Udbodhan]] magazine, in which she expressed her strong desire for the life of renunciation.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.124</ref> It created interest among intellectual circles, especially in the circles of Ramakrishna followers.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.124</ref>\n\nFrom 1954 to 1958, Sri Sarada Math was a branch centre of the Ramakrishna Math at Belur.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.135</ref> The Trustees of [[Belur Math]] assumed the responsibility of its administration. However, only the inmates of the Sri Sarada Math conducted the day-to-day work of the Math. When necessity arose, they sought advice from the senior monks of Belur Math.After the inaugural of the Sri Sarada Math,Swami the Belur Math authorities instructed that monks would no longer visit it without proper reason or prior permission.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.134</ref>\n\nIn 1958, eight Brahmacharinis of the women's Math were tonsured and they performed the Shraddha ceremony. Then on 2 January 1959, in the Old Shrine of Belur Math, the President, [[Shankarananda_(Ramakrishna_monk)|Swami Shankarananda]] and other senior monks conducted the Viraja Homa, and the eight Brahmacharinis were ordained into formal Sannyasa. They were given the ochre robes and new names. Swami Madhavananda had compiled the names. They would be prefixed by \u2018Pravrajika\u2019 and ended with \u2018prana\u2019. So the names of the eight pioneer sannyasinis were [[Pravrajika Bharatiprana]],<ref>Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 1992),p.48</ref> [[Pravrajika Mokshaprana]], [[Pravrajika Muktiprana]], [[Pravrajika Dayaprana]], [[Pravrajika Vidyaprana]], [[Pravrajika Shraddhaprana]],<ref>Pravrajika Shraddhaprana (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 2009),p.20</ref> [[Pravrajika Bhaktiprana]], and [[Pravrajika Medhaprana]].\n\nOn 26 August 1959, the Sri Sarada Math were recognised as an independent organisation and the full administration were handed over to the nuns. Seven of its Sannyasinis were elected to be the Trustees. The Trust deed was registered on 9 September 1959. With this, the President of the Sri Sarada Math was also given the responsibilities to give spiritual initiation (Mantra Diksha), brahmacharya initiation and the conferring of [[Sannyasa]] to eligible women. Thus, an independent Order of Sannyasinis were created.<ref>Pravrajika Atmaprana, Monasticism for Indian Women, Monasticism Ideal and Traditions (Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai: Chennai1991), p.303</ref>\n\nSri [[Sankaracharya]] did not sanction [[sannyasa]] for women.<ref>Pravrajika Atmaprana, ''Monasticism for Indian Women, Monasticism Ideal and Traditions'' (Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai: Chennai1991), p.303</ref> But [[Swami Vivekananda]] laid the foundation to admit women into the Puri [[Sampradaya]], one of the ten Orders of the Dasanami [[Sampradaya]] started by [[Sankaracharya]].<ref>''Udbodhan'' (Phalgun issue B.S.1379)</ref> Not only this, the nuns were also given the right to confer Sannyasa upon other aspiring women. This honour was an epoch-making incident in the history of the Hindu religion.\n\nFrom the establishment of Sri Sarada Math in 1954 till it was legally independent in 1959, the total number of its members was 52. After that, many lay devotees of Ramakrishna came forward to help. In May 1960, the Trustees of the Sri Sarada Math established the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission. The function of the Math gives emphasis on spiritual development (Atmano Mokshartham) while the Mission's main aim is service to society (Jagad Hitaya). Women devotees with faith in this ideal can become members of the Mission.\n\nFollowing the legal establishment of Ramakrisna Sarada Mission, the two institutions run by the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] for women, the [[Matri Bhavan]] (maternity hospital) in south Kolkata and the Entally Ashrama, Women's Welfare Centre in central [[Kolkata]] were handed over to [[Ramakrishna Sarada Mission]] in 1961.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.138</ref>\n\nWith donation from a devotee, Sri Devendranath Bhattacharya, the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission Vidyabhavan, a degree college was started in 1961. Later, some girls who received education at this college, have joined Sri Sarada Math and became nuns.\n\nIn 1963, the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] authorities handed over the [[Sister Nivedita Girls' School]]<ref>http://www.sisterniveditagirlsschool.org/grandhistory.html</ref> to the [[Ramakrishna Sarada Mission]].<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.138</ref>\n\n== The Emblem and Motto ==\nThe emblem of the [[Ramakrishna Math]] designed by [[Swami Vivekananda]] was slightly modified to keep a separate identity. In Sri Sarada Math's emblem, the swan and snake are facing the opposite direction. Two small lotus buds were added to the blooming lotus.

[[Swami Vivekananda]] realized the dire necessity of women's Math which he expressed through his letters from 1894 to 1901.\n\n\u201cThere is no chance for the welfare of the world unless the condition of women is improved\u2026 Hence it is that my first endeavor is to start a Math for women.\u201d<ref>''Letters of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1993), p.201 \n</ref>\n\n\"Mother (Sri Sarada Devi) has been born to revive...[[Shakti]] in India; and making her the nucleus, once more will [[Gargi Vachaknavi|Gargis]] and [[Maitreyi]]s be born into the world... Hence it is her Math that I want first... Without the grace of [[Shakti]] nothing is to be accomplished.... Hence we must first build a Math for Mother.\u201d<ref>''Letters of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1993), p.181</ref>\n\n\u201cBrother, in this terrible winter I am lecturing from place to place and fighting against odds, so that funds may be collected for Mother\u2019s Math.\u201d<ref>''Letters of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1993), p.181</ref>\n\n\u201cWith the Holy Mother (Sri Sarada Devi) as the centre of inspiration, a Math is to be established on the eastern bank of the [[Ganga]].\u201d<ref>''Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1989), vol.7, p.214</ref>\n\n\u201cIn the Women's Math there shall be no connection with monks, and in the Math for Men no connection with nuns.\u201d<ref>''Rules and Regulations of the Ramakrishna Math'', Belur, (1967), p.2</ref>\n\n[[Swami Vivekananda]] wanted women to set right their own problems. He has witnessed some outstanding women of renunciation among the women disciples of [[Sri Ramakrishna]] such as [[Gauri Ma]], [[Yogin Ma]], and [[Golap Ma]]. He wanted them to spread the message of Sri Ramakrishna through an organisation.<ref>''Letters of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1993), p.112</ref>\n\nIncidently, [[Sri Sarada Devi]] too, cherished the dream to start a monastery for women. This came to light from the letters of [[Swami Saradananda]] written to [[Sara Bull]], '[[Sister Nivedita]] and myself have found out by talking to Mother that she would like to see a convent started in the fashion of the Math, Belur, for women. Miss Glen who was here to visit the Holy Mother... also had a talk with Mother about it, and is very sanguine about the work.'<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.126</ref>\n\n== Activities ==\n6 November 1981, the stone temple was consecrated as per the Hindu tradition.

To name a few, Pravrajika Ajayaprana Mataji, Pravrajika Divyanandaprana<ref>http://vedantadc.org/sri-ramakrishna-and-vedanta-pravrajika-divyanandaprana</ref>, are some well-known nuns of Sri Sarada Math.\n\n== Branch Centres ==\nSri Sarada Math has since its inception spread to several parts of the world. The nuns, though small in numbers have been contributing significantly through their selfless activities. \n\n=== Ramakrishna Sarada Vedanta Society of New South Wales ===\nA branch centre was opened in New South Wales, and Pravrajika Ajayaprana became its president from 1982 to 2011.<ref>https://saradavedanta.org/our-presidents/</ref>.

[[Swami Vivekananda]] realized the dire necessity of women's Math which he expressed through his letters from 1894 to 1901.\n\n\u201cThere is no chance for the welfare of the world unless the condition of women is improved\u2026 Hence it is that my first endeavor is to start a Math for women.\u201d<ref>''Letters of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1993), p.201 \n</ref>\n\n\"Mother (Sri Sarada Devi) has been born to revive...[[Shakti]] in India; and making her the nucleus, once more will [[Gargi Vachaknavi|Gargis]] and [[Maitreyi]]s be born into the world...

He wanted them to spread the message of Sri Ramakrishna through an organisation.<ref>''Letters of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1993), p.112</ref>\n\nIncidently, [[Sri Sarada Devi]] too, cherished the dream to start a monastery for women. This came to light from the letters of [[Swami Saradananda]] written to [[Sara Bull]], '[[Sister Nivedita]] and myself have found out by talking to Mother that she would like to see a convent started in the fashion of the Math, Belur, for women.

Francis is the first [[Jesuit]] pope, the first from the Americas, the first from the [[Southern Hemisphere]], and the first pope from outside Europe since the Syrian [[Pope Gregory III|Gregory III]], who reigned in the 8th century.\n\nBorn in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina, Bergoglio was ordained a [[Catholic priest]] in 1969, and from 1973 to 1979 was Argentina's [[provincial superior]] of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits). He became the [[archbishop of Buenos Aires]] in 1998 and was created a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] in 2001 by [[Pope John Paul II]]. He led the Argentine Church during the [[December 2001 riots in Argentina]]. The administrations of [[N\u00e9stor Kirchner]] and [[Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner]] considered him a political rival. Following the [[resignation of Pope Benedict XVI]] on 28 February 2013, [[2013 papal conclave|a papal conclave]] elected Bergoglio as his successor on 13 March. He chose Francis as his [[papal name]] in honor of [[Saint Francis of Assisi]].\n\nThroughout his public life, Pope Francis has been noted for his humility, emphasis on God's mercy, international visibility as pope, concern for the [[poor]] and commitment to [[interfaith dialogue]]. He is credited with having a less formal approach to the papacy than his predecessors, for instance choosing to reside in the [[Domus Sanctae Marthae]] guesthouse rather than in the [[papal apartments]] of the [[Apostolic Palace]] used by previous popes. He maintains that the Church should be more open and welcoming. He does not support unbridled [[capitalism]], [[Marxism]], or Marxist versions of [[liberation theology]]. Francis maintains the traditional views of the Church regarding [[Abortion and the Catholic Church|abortion]], [[Marriage in the Catholic Church|marriage]], [[Ordination of women and the Catholic Church|ordination of women]], and [[Clerical celibacy (Catholic Church)|clerical celibacy]]. He opposes [[consumerism]] and [[overdevelopment]], and supports taking action on [[climate change]], a focus of his papacy with the promulgation of ''[[Laudato si']]''. In international diplomacy, he helped to temporarily restore [[United States\u2013Cuban Thaw|full diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba]] and [[Theology of Pope Francis#Refugees and migrants|supported the cause of refugees]] during the [[European migrant crisis|European]] and [[Central American migrant caravans|Central American migrant]] crises. Since 2018, he has been a vocal opponent of [[neo-nationalism]]. Francis has faced increasingly open criticism, particularly from theological conservatives, on many questions, including the admission of civilly divorced and remarried Catholics to [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|Communion]] with the publication of ''[[Amoris laetitia]]'' and on the question of the alleged cover-up of [[Catholic Church sexual abuse cases|clergy sexual abuse]], against which he promulgated ''[[Vos estis lux mundi]]''.\n\n==Early years==\n[[File:Jorge Mario Bergoglio attended a salesian school between 1948 and 1949.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Jorge Mario Bergoglio (fourth boy from the left on the third row from the top) at age 12, while studying at the Salesian College (c. 1948-49)]]\nJorge Mario Bergoglio was born on 17 December 1936<ref name=\"directory\">{{cite web|title=Direttorju Ekklezjastiku 2016|url=http://ms.maltadiocese.org/WEBSITE/2016/DIRETTORJU2016.pdf|date=30 June 2016|publisher=The Church in Malta|language=Maltese, English|pages=1\u20132|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122212612/http://ms.maltadiocese.org/WEBSITE/2016/DIRETTORJU2016.pdf|archivedate=22 November 2016}}</ref> in [[Flores, Buenos Aires|Flores]],<ref name=Remeseira/> a [[Subdivisions of Buenos Aires|neighborhood]] of [[Buenos Aires]].<ref name=\"directory\"/> He was the eldest<ref name=Garrido/> of five children of Mario Jos\u00e9 Bergoglio (1908\u20131959) and Regina Mar\u00eda S\u00edvori (1911\u20131981).

It is taken from the homilies of the [[Bede|Venerable Bede]] on [[Gospel of Matthew|Saint Matthew's Gospel]] relating to his vocation: 'Jesus saw the tax collector and by having mercy chose him as an apostle saying to him: Follow me.'\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2013/03/18/pope_francis_:_miserando_atque_eligendo.../en1-674605 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130705010045/http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2013/03/18/pope_francis_%3A_miserando_atque_eligendo.../en1-674605 |archivedate= 5 July 2013 |title=Pope Francis: \"Miserando atque eligendo\"... |first=Veronica |last=Scarisbrick |date=18 March 2013 |website= |publisher=[[Vatican Radio]] |accessdate=19 March 2013 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>}}\n}}\n{{Infobox pope styles\n|image=Coat of arms of Franciscus.svg\n|image_size=200px\n|dipstyle=[[His Holiness]]\n|offstyle=Your Holiness\n|relstyle=Holy Father\n|deathstyle=\n}}\n{{Catholic Church sidebar}}\n'''Pope Francis''' ({{lang-la|Franciscus}}; {{lang-it|Francesco}}; {{lang-es|Francisco}}; born '''Jorge Mario Bergoglio''';{{efn|Pronunciation: {{IPA-es|\u02c8xo\u027exe \u02c8ma\u027ejo \u03b2e\u027e\u02c8\u0263o\u0263ljo|}} (Spanish), {{IPA-it|ber\u02c8\u0261\u0254\u028e\u028eo|}} (Italian)}} 17 December 1936) is the head of the [[Catholic Church]] and [[List of sovereigns of Vatican City State|sovereign]] of the [[Vatican City|Vatican City State]]. Francis is the first [[Jesuit]] pope, the first from the Americas, the first from the [[Southern Hemisphere]], and the first pope from outside Europe since the Syrian [[Pope Gregory III|Gregory III]], who reigned in the 8th century.\n\nBorn in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina, Bergoglio was ordained a [[Catholic priest]] in 1969, and from 1973 to 1979 was Argentina's [[provincial superior]] of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits). He became the [[archbishop of Buenos Aires]] in 1998 and was created a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] in 2001 by [[Pope John Paul II]]. He led the Argentine Church during the [[December 2001 riots in Argentina]]. The administrations of [[N\u00e9stor Kirchner]] and [[Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner]] considered him a political rival. Following the [[resignation of Pope Benedict XVI]] on 28 February 2013, [[2013 papal conclave|a papal conclave]] elected Bergoglio as his successor on 13 March. He chose Francis as his [[papal name]] in honor of [[Saint Francis of Assisi]].\n\nThroughout his public life, Pope Francis has been noted for his humility, emphasis on God's mercy, international visibility as pope, concern for the [[poor]] and commitment to [[interfaith dialogue]]. He is credited with having a less formal approach to the papacy than his predecessors, for instance choosing to reside in the [[Domus Sanctae Marthae]] guesthouse rather than in the [[papal apartments]] of the [[Apostolic Palace]] used by previous popes. He maintains that the Church should be more open and welcoming. He does not support unbridled [[capitalism]], [[Marxism]], or Marxist versions of [[liberation theology]]. Francis maintains the traditional views of the Church regarding [[Abortion and the Catholic Church|abortion]], [[Marriage in the Catholic Church|marriage]], [[Ordination of women and the Catholic Church|ordination of women]], and [[Clerical celibacy (Catholic Church)|clerical celibacy]]. He opposes [[consumerism]] and [[overdevelopment]], and supports taking action on [[climate change]], a focus of his papacy with the promulgation of ''[[Laudato si']]''. In international diplomacy, he helped to temporarily restore [[United States\u2013Cuban Thaw|full diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba]] and [[Theology of Pope Francis#Refugees and migrants|supported the cause of refugees]] during the [[European migrant crisis|European]] and [[Central American migrant caravans|Central American migrant]] crises. Since 2018, he has been a vocal opponent of [[neo-nationalism]]. Francis has faced increasingly open criticism, particularly from theological conservatives, on many questions, including the admission of civilly divorced and remarried Catholics to [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|Communion]] with the publication of ''[[Amoris laetitia]]'' and on the question of the alleged cover-up of [[Catholic Church sexual abuse cases|clergy sexual abuse]], against which he promulgated ''[[Vos estis lux mundi]]''.\n\n==Early years==\n[[File:Jorge Mario Bergoglio attended a salesian school between 1948 and 1949.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Jorge Mario Bergoglio (fourth boy from the left on the third row from the top) at age 12, while studying at the Salesian College (c. 1948-49)]]\nJorge Mario Bergoglio was born on 17 December 1936<ref name=\"directory\">{{cite web|title=Direttorju Ekklezjastiku 2016|url=http://ms.maltadiocese.org/WEBSITE/2016/DIRETTORJU2016.pdf|date=30 June 2016|publisher=The Church in Malta|language=Maltese, English|pages=1\u20132|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122212612/http://ms.maltadiocese.org/WEBSITE/2016/DIRETTORJU2016.pdf|archivedate=22 November 2016}}</ref> in [[Flores, Buenos Aires|Flores]],<ref name=Remeseira/> a [[Subdivisions of Buenos Aires|neighborhood]] of [[Buenos Aires]].<ref name=\"directory\"/> He was the eldest<ref name=Garrido/> of five children of Mario Jos\u00e9 Bergoglio (1908\u20131959) and Regina Mar\u00eda S\u00edvori (1911\u20131981).

1895 and 1945.\n\nTaiwan became a [[Dependent territory|dependency]] of Japan in 1895 when the [[Qing dynasty]] of China ceded [[Taiwan Province]] in the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] after Japanese victory in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]]. The short-lived [[Republic of Formosa]] resistance movement was [[Japanese invasion of Taiwan (1895)|suppressed by Japanese troops]] and quickly defeated in the [[Capitulation of Tainan (1895)|Capitulation  of Tainan]], ending organized resistance to Japanese occupation and inaugurated five decades of Japanese rule. Taiwan was Japan's first [[colony|overseas colony]] and can be viewed as the first steps in implementing their \"[[Nanshin-ron|Southern Expansion Doctrine]]\" of the late 19th century. Japanese intentions were to turn Taiwan into a showpiece \"model colony\" with much effort made to improve the island's economy, [[public works]], [[industry]], cultural [[Japanization]], and to support the necessities of Japanese military aggression in the [[Asia-Pacific]].<ref>{{cite journal | last= Pastreich |first=Emanuel | title = Sovereignty, Wealth, Culture, and Technology: Mainland China and Taiwan Grapple with the Parameters of \"Nation State\" in the 21st Century | publisher = Program in Arms Control, Disarmament, and International Security, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign | date = July 2003 |oclc=859917872 |url=http://historia-actual.org/Publicaciones/index.php/haol/article/view/96}}</ref> \n\nJapanese rule of Taiwan ended after the [[surrender of Japan]] concluded [[World War II]] in August 1945, and the territory was placed under the control of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] (ROC) with the issuing of [[General Order No. 1]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Chen|first1=C.

In 1609, the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]] sent [[Arima Harunobu ]] on an exploratory mission of the island. In 1616, [[Murayama Toan]] led an unsuccessful invasion of the island.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nIn November 1871, 69 people on board a vessel from the [[Ryukyu Kingdom|Kingdom of Ryukyu]] were forced to land near the southern tip of Taiwan by strong winds. They had a conflict with local [[Paiwan people|Paiwan]] aborigines and many were killed. In October 1872, Japan sought compensation from the Qing dynasty of China, claiming the Kingdom of [[Ryukyu]] was part of Japan. In May 1873, Japanese diplomats arrived in Beijing and put forward their claims, but the Qing government immediately rejected Japanese demands on the ground that the Kingdom of [[Ryukyu]] at that time was an independent state and had nothing to do with Japan. The Japanese refused to leave and asked if the Chinese government would punish those \"barbarians in Taiwan\".{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nThe Qing authorities explained that there were two kinds of aborigines on Taiwan: those directly governed by the Qing, and those unnaturalized \"raw barbarians... beyond the reach of Chinese culture. Thus could not be directly regulated.\" They indirectly hinted that foreigners traveling in those areas settled by indigenous people must exercise caution. The Qing dynasty made it clear to the Japanese that Taiwan was definitely within Qing jurisdiction, even though part of that island's aboriginal population was not yet under the influence of Chinese culture. The Qing also pointed to similar cases all over the world where an aboriginal population within a national boundary was not under the influence of the dominant culture of that country.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Zhao |first1=Jiaying |script-title=zh:\u4e2d\u56fd\u8fd1\u4ee3\u5916\u4ea4\u53f2 |date=1994 |publisher=\u5c71\u897f\u9ad8\u6821\u8054\u5408\u51fa\u7248\u793e |location=Taiyuan |isbn=9787810325776 |edition=1st |language=Chinese |trans-title=A Diplomatic History of China}}</ref>\n\nThe Japanese nevertheless launched an [[Taiwan expedition of 1874|expedition]] to Taiwan, with a force of 3,000 soldiers in April 1874. In May 1874, the Qing dynasty began to send in troops to reinforce the island. By the end of the year, the government of Japan decided to withdraw its forces after realizing Japan was still not ready for a war with China.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nThe number of casualties for the Paiwan was about 30, and that for the Japanese was 543 (12 Japanese soldiers were killed in battle and 531 by disease).{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}\n\n=== Cession of Taiwan (1895)===\n[[File:Japanese Soldier Entering Taipei(1895).jpg|thumb|Painting of Japanese soldiers entering the city of Taipeh (Taipei) in 1895 after the Treaty of Shimonoseki]]\n\nBy the 1890s, about 45 percent of Taiwan was under standard Chinese administration while the remaining lightly populated regions of the interior were under [[Taiwanese aborigine|aboriginal]] control.

Following its defeat, China ceded the islands of Taiwan and [[Pescadores|Penghu]] to Japan in the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]], signed on April 17, 1895. According to the terms of the treaty, Taiwan and Penghu (isles between 119\u02daE-120\u02daE and 23\u02daN-24\u02daN) were to be ceded to Japan in perpetuity. Both governments were to send representatives to Taiwan immediately after signing to begin the transition process, which was to be completed in no more than two months. Because Taiwan was ceded by treaty, the period that followed is referred to by some as the \"colonial period\", while others who focus on the fact that it was the culmination of a war refer to it as the \"occupation period\".  The cession ceremony took place on board a Japanese vessel because the Chinese delegate feared reprisal from the residents of Taiwan.{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|p=293}}\n\nThough the terms dictated by Japan were harsh, it is reported{{by whom|date=April 2016}} that Qing China's leading statesman, [[Li Hongzhang]], sought to assuage [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] by remarking: \"birds do not sing and flowers are not fragrant on the island of Taiwan.

During this period, popular resistance to Japanese rule was high, and the world questioned whether a non-Western nation such as Japan could effectively govern a colony of its own. An 1897 session of the [[Japanese Diet]] debated whether to sell Taiwan to France.<ref>{{cite book|author=Shaohua Hu|title=Foreign Policies toward Taiwan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TlsvDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT39&dq=In+1897,+the+Japanese+Diet+actually+considered+selling+Taiwan+to+France&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi0qM3Tie3iAhXtmOAKHTENC_8Q6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=In%201897%2C%20the%20Japanese%20Diet%20actually%20considered%20selling%20Taiwan%20to%20France&f=false|year=2018|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-138-06174-3|pages=161\u2013}}</ref> During these years, the post of [[Governor-General of Taiwan]] was held by a military general, as the emphasis was on suppression of the insurgency.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nIn 1898, the [[Meiji government]] of Japan appointed Count [[Kodama Gentar\u014d]] as the fourth Governor-General, with the talented civilian politician [[Got\u014d Shinpei]] as his Chief of Home Affairs, establishing the [[carrot and stick]] approach towards governance that would continue for several years.<ref name=gio7 /> This marked the beginning of a colonial government (formally known as the Office of the Governor-General) dominated by Japanese, but subject to colonial law.\n\nJapan's approach to ruling Taiwan could be roughly divided into two views. The first, supported by Got\u014d, held that from a biological perspective, the natives could not be completely assimilated. Thus, Japan would have to follow the British approach, and Taiwan would never be governed exactly the same way as the [[Japanese archipelago|Home Islands]] but would be governed under a whole new set of laws. The opposing viewpoint was held by future Prime Minister [[Hara Takashi]], who believed that the Taiwanese and Koreans were similar enough to the Japanese to be fully absorbed into Japanese society, and was thus in favor of using the same legal and governmental approaches on the colonies as those used in the Home Islands.\n\nColonial policy towards Taiwan mostly followed the approach championed by Got\u014d during his tenure as Chief of Home Affairs between March 1898 and November 1906, and this approach continued to be in effect until [[Hara Takashi]] became prime minister in 1918. During this period, the colonial government was authorized to pass special laws and edicts, while wielding complete executive, legislative, and military power. With this absolute power, the colonial government moved to maintain social stability, while suppressing dissent.\n\n===D\u014dka: \"Integration\" (1915\u20131937)===\n[[File:Xie Jieshi.JPG|thumb|130px|[[Xie Jishi]], [[Manchukuo]] [[Foreign Minister]]]]\n[[File:Koo Hsien-jung in 1914.JPG|thumb|130px|[[Koo Hsien-jung]], member of the [[House of Peers (Japan)|House of Peers]]]]\n\nThe second period of Japanese rule is generally classified as being between the end of the 1915 [[Ta-pa-ni Incident|Tapani Incident]], and the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] of 1937, which began Japan's involvement in what would become [[World War II]]. World events during this period, such as [[World War I]], would drastically alter the perception of [[colonialism]] in the Western world, and give rise to growing waves of nationalism amongst colonial natives, as well as the ideas of [[self determination]]. As a result, colonial governments throughout the world began to make greater concessions to natives, and colonial governance was gradually liberalized. Taiwan-born [[Xie Jishi]] became a first [[Foreign Minister]] of [[Manchukuo]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}{{relevance inline|date=February 2013}}\n\nThe political climate in Japan was also undergoing changes during this time. In the mid-1910s the Japanese government had gradually democratized in what is known as the [[Taish\u014d period]] (1912\u201325), where power was concentrated in the elected lower house of the [[Japanese Diet|Imperial Diet]], whose electorate was expanded to include all adult males by 1925. In 1919, [[Den Kenjir\u014d]] was appointed to be the first civilian Governor-General of Taiwan. Prior to his departure for Taiwan, he conferred with Prime Minister [[Hara Takashi]], where both men agreed to pursue a policy of {{Nihongo|[[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]]|\u540c\u5316|d\u014dka}}, where Taiwan would be viewed as an extension of the Home Islands, and the Taiwanese would be educated to understand their role and responsibilities as Japanese subjects. The new policy was formally announced in October 1919.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nThis policy was continued by the colonial government for the next 20 years. In the process, local governance was instituted, as well as an elected advisory committee which included locals (though strictly in an advisory capacity), and the establishment of a public school system. [[Caning]] was forbidden as a criminal punishment, and the use of the Japanese language was rewarded. This contrasted sharply with the mostly hands-off approach taken by previous administrations towards local affairs, where the only government concerns were \"railways, [[vaccinations]], and [[running water]]\".{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\n==== Chinese diplomacy ==== <!-- Anchor from redirected [Chinese Consulate-General, Taihoku] article; caution. -->\nThe Consulate-General of the Republic of China in [[Taihoku Prefecture|Taihoku]] (modern-day [[Taipei]]) was a diplomatic mission of the [[government of the Republic of China]] (ROC) that opened April 6, 1931, and closed in 1945 after the [[Taiwan Retrocession Day|handover]] of Taiwan to the ROC.

With the rise of [[Militarism-Socialism in Sh\u014dwa Japan|militarism in Japan]] in the mid-to-late 1930s, the office of Governor-General was again held by military officers, and Japan sought to use resources and material from Taiwan in the war effort. To this end, the cooperation of the Taiwanese would be essential, and the Taiwanese would have to be fully assimilated as members of Japanese society. As a result, earlier social movements were banned and the Colonial Government devoted its full efforts to the {{nihongo4|\"K\u014dminka movement\"|\u7687\u6c11\u5316\u904b\u52d5|k\u014dminka und\u014d}}, aimed at fully Japanizing Taiwanese society.<ref name=gio7 /> Between 1936 and 1940, the K\u014dminka movement sought to build {{nihongo4|\"Japanese spirit\"|\u5927\u548c\u9b42|[[Yamato-damashii|Yamatodamash\u012b]]}} and Japanese identity amongst the populace, while the later years from 1941 to 1945 focused on encouraging Taiwanese to participate in the war effort.\n[[File:Advertisement of congratulation towards the establishment of the new Nationalist government on Taiwan Nichi Nichi Shimp\u014d.jpg|thumb|Advertisement of congratulation towards the establishment of the [[Wang Jingwei regime]] on Taiwan Nichi Nichi Shimp\u014d]]\nAs part of the movement, the Colonial Government began to strongly encourage locals to speak the Japanese language, wear [[Japanese clothing]], live in Japanese-style houses, and convert to [[Shintoism]]. In 1940, laws were also passed advocating the adoption of Japanese names. With the expansion of the [[Pacific War]], the government also began encouraging Taiwanese to volunteer for the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Navy]] in 1942, and finally ordered a full scale draft in 1945. In the meantime, laws were made to grant Taiwanese membership in the Japanese Diet, which theoretically would qualify a Taiwanese person to become the premier of Japan eventually.\n[[File:Bombing campaign.

Power was highly centralized with the Governor-General wielding supreme executive, legislative, and judicial power, effectively making the government a dictatorship.<ref name=gio7 />\n\n===Development===\nIn its earliest incarnation, the Colonial Government was composed of three bureaus: Home Affairs, Army, and Navy. The Home Affairs Bureau was further divided into four offices: Internal Affairs, Agriculture, Finance, and Education. The Army and Navy bureaus were merged to form a single Military Affairs Bureau in 1896. Following reforms in 1898, 1901, and 1919 the Home Affairs Bureau gained three more offices: General Affairs, Judicial, and Communications. This configuration would continue until the end of colonial rule.\nThe Japanese colonial government was responsible for building harbors and hospitals as well as constructing infrastructure like railroads and roads. By 1935 the Japanese expanded the roads by 4,456 kilometers, in comparison with the 164 kilometers that existed before the Japanese occupation. The Japanese government invested a lot of money in the sanitation system of the island. These campaigns against rats and unclean water supplies, contributed to a decrease of diseases such as [[cholera]] and [[malaria]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Roy|first1=Denny|title=Taiwan : a political history|url=https://archive.org/details/taiwan00denn|url-access=registration|date=2003|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca|isbn=978-0-8014-8805-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/taiwan00denn/page/39 39]|edition=1. publ.}}</ref>\n\n=== Governors-General ===\n{{Main|Governor-General of Taiwan}}\n\nThroughout the period of Japanese rule, the Office of the Governor-General remained the de facto central authority in Taiwan. Formulation and development of governmental policy was primarily the role of the central or local bureaucracy.\n\nIn the 50 years of Japanese rule from 1895 to 1945, Tokyo dispatched nineteen Governors-General to Taiwan. On average, a Governor-General served about 2.5 years. The entire colonial period can be further divided into three periods based on the background of the Governor-General: the Early Military period, the Civilian period, and the Later Military period.\n\nGovernors-General from the Early Military period included [[Kabayama Sukenori]], [[Katsura Tar\u014d]], [[Nogi Maresuke]], [[Kodama Gentar\u014d]], [[Sakuma Samata]], [[Ando Sadami]], and [[Akashi Motojiro]]. Two of the pre-1919 Governors-General, Nogi Maresuke and Kodama Gentar\u014d, would become famous in the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. And\u014d Sadami and Akashi Motojir\u014d are generally acknowledged to have done the most for Taiwanese interests during their tenures, with Akashi Motojir\u014d actually requesting in his will that he be buried in Taiwan, [[Akashi Motojiro#Death and burial|which he indeed was]].\n\nThe Civilian period occurred at roughly the same time as the [[Taish\u014d period|Taish\u014d democracy]] in Japan, Governors-General from this period were mostly nominated by the [[Japanese Diet]] and included [[Den Kenjir\u014d]], [[Uchida Kakichi]], [[Izawa Takio]], [[Kamiyama Mitsunoshin]], [[Kawamura Takeji]], [[Ishizuka Eiz\u014d]], [[\u014cta Masahiro]], [[Minami Hiroshi]], and [[Nakagawa Kenz\u014d]]. During their tenures, the Colonial Government devoted most of its resources to economic and social development rather than military suppression.\n\nThe Governors-General of the Later Military period focused primarily on supporting the Japanese war effort and included [[Seiz\u014d Kobayashi]], [[Kiyoshi Hasegawa (admiral)|Kiyoshi Hasegawa]], and [[Rikichi Ando]].\n\n; List of Governors-General of Taiwan\n# [[Kabayama Sukenori]] (1895\u201396)\n# [[Katsura Tar\u014d]] (1896)\n# [[Nogi Maresuke]] (1896\u201398)\n# [[Kodama Gentar\u014d]] (1898\u20131906)\n# [[Sakuma Samata]] (1906\u201315)\n# [[And\u014d Teibi|And\u014d Sadami]] (1915\u201318)\n# [[Akashi Motojiro]] (1918\u201319)\n# [[Den Kenjir\u014d]] (1919\u201323)\n# [[Uchida Kakichi]] (1923\u201324)\n# [[Izawa Takio]] (1924\u201326)\n# [[Kamiyama Mitsunoshin]] (1926\u201328)\n# [[Kawamura Takeji]] (1928\u201329)\n# [[Ishizuka Eizo]] (1929\u201331)\n# [[Ota Masahiro]] (1931\u201332)\n# [[Hiroshi Minami (politician)|Hiroshi Minami]] (1932)\n# [[Kenzo Nakagawa]] (1932\u201336)\n# [[Seizo Kobayashi]] (1936\u201340)\n# [[Kiyoshi Hasegawa (admiral)|Kiyoshi Hasegawa]] (1940\u201344)\n# [[Rikichi And\u014d]] (1944\u201345)\n\n===Chief of Home Affairs===\nFormally known as the Director of the Home Affairs Bureau, the Chief of Home Affairs (\u7e3d\u52d9\u9577\u5b98) was the primary executor of colonial policy in Taiwan, and the second most powerful individual in the Colonial Government.\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n{{Main|Political divisions of Taiwan (1895\u20131945)}}\n\n[[File:Er nd 1020 Tainan.jpg|thumb|[[National Museum of Taiwan Literature|Government building]] of Tainan Prefecture]]\n\nBesides the Governor-General and the Chief of Home Affairs, the Office of the Governor-General was a strictly hierarchical bureaucracy including departments of law enforcement, agriculture, finance, education, mining, external affairs, and judicial affairs.

Instead, this action resulted from strategy during the war with China and from diplomacy carried out in the spring of 1895. Prime Minister Hirobumi's southern strategy, supportive of Japanese navy designs, paved the way for the occupation of [[Penghu Islands]] in late March as a prelude to the takeover of Taiwan. Soon after, while peace negotiations continued, Hirobumi and Mustsu Munemitsu, his minister of foreign affairs, stipulated that both Taiwan and Penghu were to be ceded by imperial China.<ref name=\"Edward I-te Chen\" >{{cite journal |last1=Chen |first1=Edward I-te |title=Japan's Decision to Annex Taiwan: A Study of Ito-Mutsu Diplomacy, 1894\u201395 |journal=The Journal of Asian Studies |date=November 1977 |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=66\u201367 |doi=10.2307/2053328 |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nLi Huang-chang, China's chief diplomat, was forced to accede to these conditions as well as to other Japanese demands, and the Treaty of Shimonoseki was signed on April 17, then duly ratified by the Qing court on 8 May.

Tokyo expected the large and productive island to furnish provisions and raw materials for Japan's expanding economy and to become a ready market for Japanese goods. Taiwan's strategic location was deemed advantageous as well. As envisioned by the navy, the island would form a southern bastion of defense from which to safeguard southernmost China and southeastern Asia.

This period of Han and aboriginal resistance is usually divided{{by whom|date=July 2012}} into three stages: the defense of the [[Republic of Formosa]]; guerilla warfare following the collapse of the Republic; and a final stage between the [[Beipu uprising]] of 1907, and the [[Tapani Incident]] of 1915. Afterwards, Han armed resistance was mostly replaced by peaceful forms of cultural and political activism, while the mountain aboriginals continued to carry out armed struggle such as in the [[Musha Incident]] in 1930.\n\n===Republic of Formosa===\n[[File:Flag of Formosa 1895.svg|thumb|left|The flag of the Republic of Formosa, 1895]]\n{{See also|Republic of Formosa|Japanese invasion of Taiwan (1895)}}\n\nThe decision by the Qing Chinese government to cede Taiwan to Japan with the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] caused a massive uproar in Taiwan. On 25 May 1895, a group of pro-Qing officials and local gentry declared independence from China, proclaiming a new [[Republic of Formosa]] with the goal of keeping Taiwan under Qing rule, choosing then Qing governor [[Tang Jingsong]] as their reluctant president. In response, Japanese forces [[Japanese Invasion of Taiwan (1895)|landed]] in [[Keelung]] on 29 May, taking the city on 3 June. President Tang and his Vice-President [[Qiu Fengjia]] fled the island for mainland China the following day. Later in the same month, remaining supporters of the new Republic gathered in [[Tainan]] and selected [[Liu Yongfu]] as the second president. The local Taiwanese Han militia units were mobilized to counter the Japanese occupation. After a series of bloody conflicts between the Japanese and local Taiwanese forces, the Japanese had successfully seized Tainan by late October, inflicting heavy casualties on the Taiwanese side. Shortly afterwards, President Liu fled Taiwan for mainland China, bringing the 184-day history of the Republic to an end.\n\n===Guerrillas===\n\n<blockquote>\n\"The cession of the island to Japan was received with such disfavour by the Chinese inhabitants that a large military force was required to effect its occupation. For nearly two years afterwards, a bitter guerrilla resistance was offered to the Japanese troops, and large forces \u2013 over 100,000 men, it was stated at the time \u2013 were required for its suppression. This was not accomplished without much cruelty on the part of the conquerors, who, in their march through the island, perpetrated all the worst excesses of war. They had, undoubtedly, considerable provocation. They were constantly attacked by ambushed enemies, and their losses from battle and disease far exceeded the entire loss of the whole Japanese army throughout the Manchurian campaign. But their revenge was often taken on innocent villagers. Men, women, and children were ruthlessly slaughtered or became the victims of unrestrained lust and rapine. The result was to drive from their homes thousands of industrious and peaceful peasants, who, long after the main resistance had been completely crushed, continued to wage a vendetta war, and to generate feelings of hatred which the succeeding years of conciliation and good government have not wholly eradicated.\" \u2013 ''[[The_Cambridge_Modern_History#XII._The_Latest_Age_(1910)|The Cambridge Modern History]]'', Volume 12<ref name=\"WardProthero1910\">{{cite book|author1=Sir [[Adolphus William Ward]]|author2=[[George Walter Prothero]]|author3=Sir [[Stanley Mordaunt Leathes]]|author4=[[Ernest Alfred Benians]]|title=The Cambridge Modern History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EMBBAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA573|year=1910|publisher=Macmillan|pages=573\u2013}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Republic of Formosa, the Japanese Governor-General [[Kabayama Sukenori]] reported to Tokyo that \"the island is secured\", and proceeded to begin the task of administration. However, in December a series of anti-Japanese uprisings occurred in northern Taiwan, and would continue to occur at a rate of roughly one per month. By 1902, however, most anti-Japanese activity amongst the ethnic Chinese population had died down. Along the way, 14,000 Taiwanese, or 0.5% of the population had been killed.<ref name = msu>{{cite web |title = Taiwan \u2013 History |website = Windows on Asia | publisher = [[Asian Studies Center, Michigan State University]] | url = http://asia.isp.msu.edu/wbwoa/east_asia/taiwan/history.htm |accessdate = 2014-12-22}}</ref>\nTaiwan would remain relatively calm until the Beipu Uprising in 1907.

On October 27, 1930, following escalation of an incident in which a Japanese police officer insulted a tribesman, over 300 [[Seediq people|Seediq]] [[Taiwanese aborigine|aborigines]] under Chief [[Mona Rudao]] attacked Japanese residents in the area. In the ensuing violence, 134 Japanese nationals and two ethnic Han Taiwanese were killed, and 215 Japanese nationals injured. The Han were mistaken for Japanese by the aboriginals since one of the victims, a Han girl, was wearing a Kimono. Many of the victims were attending an athletic festival at Musyaji Elementary School. In response, the colonial government ordered a military crackdown. In the two months that followed, most of the insurgents were either killed or committed suicide, along with their family members or fellow tribesmen. Several members of the government resigned over the incident, which proved to be the most violent of the uprisings during Japanese rule.\n\nLocal administration continued to be strict, however, and not all modifications in governance had liberal overtones. Special criminal statues relating to public order and peace preservation were introduced from Japan, for example.<ref name=\"Tay sheng Wang\"/> These severe enactments also included governmental responses to the peaceful resistance developed in the colony: in particular, to the new modes of protest{{which|date=July 2012}} staged by leaders{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} among the younger generation of Taiwanese.\n\n===Dafen incident===\nThe [[Bunun people|Bunun Aboriginals]] under Chief [[Raho Ari]] [[w:zh:\u62c9\u8377\u00b7\u963f\u96f7|\u62c9\u8377\u00b7\u963f\u96f7]] (l\u0101h\u00e8\u00b7 \u0101l\u00e9i) engaged in guerrilla warfare against the Japanese for twenty years. Raho Ari's revolt, called the Dafen incident [[w:zh:\u5927\u5206\u4e8b\u4ef6]] was sparked when the Japanese implemented a gun control policy in 1914 against the Aboriginals in which their rifles were impounded in police stations when hunting expeditions were over. The revolt began at Dafen when a police platoon was slaughtered by Raho Ari's clan in 1915. A settlement holding 266 people called Tamaho was created by Raho Ari and his followers near the source of the Laonong River and attracted more Bunun rebels to their cause. Raho Ari and his followers captured bullets and guns and slew Japanese in repeated hit and run raids against Japanese police stations by infiltrating over the Japanese \"guardline\" of electrified fences and police stations as they pleased.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=3YOoAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA16&lpg=PA16&dq=Raho+Ari&source=bl&ots=PTYSC8s1X1&sig=C1LuNrDq0TwO2poUsitZyo8vjvw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=gEG3VKV2g66CBMLDgrAB&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Raho%20Ari&f=false Crook 2014], p. 16.</ref>\n\n===Siaolin Incident===\nAs a resistance to the long-term oppression by the Japanese government, many [[Taivoan people]] from Jiaxian led the first local rebellion against Japan in July 1915, called the Jiaxian Incident (\u7532\u4ed9\u57d4\u4e8b\u4ef6). This was followed by a wider rebellion from [[Yuchin Basin]] in [[Tainan]] to [[Jiasian District|Jiasian]] in [[Kaohsiung]] in August 1915, known as the [[Tapani incident|Tapani Incident]] (\u564d\u5427\u54d6\u4e8b\u4ef6) in which more than 1,400 local people died or were killed by the Japanese government. Twenty-two years later, the Taivoan people struggled to carry on another rebellion; since most of the indigenous people were from [[Siaolin Village|Siaolin]], the resistance taking place in 1937 was named the Siaolin Incident (\u5c0f\u6797\u4e8b\u4ef6).<ref>{{Cite book|title=\u7a2e\u56de\u5c0f\u6797\u6751\u7684\u8a18\u61b6 : \u5927\u6b66\u58e0\u6c11\u65cf\u690d\u7269\u66a8\u90e8\u843d\u50b3\u627f400\u5e74\u4eba\u6587\u8a8c (A 400-Year Memory of Xiaolin Taivoan: Their Botany, Their History, and Their People)|last=|first=|publisher=\u9ad8\u96c4\u5e02\u6749\u6797\u5340\u65e5\u5149\u5c0f\u6797\u793e\u5340\u767c\u5c55\u5354\u6703 (Sunrise Xiaolin Community Development Association)|year=2017|isbn=978-986-95852-0-0|location=Kaohsiung City|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Economic and educational development==\n[[File:TaiwanShow1935-2.jpg|thumb|Poster for the 1935 Taiwan Exposition]]\n\nOne of the most notable features of Japanese rule in Taiwan was the \"top-down\" nature of social change. While local activism certainly played a role, most of the social, economic, and cultural changes during this period were driven by [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrats]] in the colonial government. With the Colonial Government as the primary driving force, as well as new immigrants from the Japanese [[Japanese archipelago|Home Islands]], Taiwanese society was sharply divided between the rulers and the ruled.\n\nUnder the constant control of the colonial government, aside from a few small incidents during the earlier years of Japanese rule, Taiwanese society was mostly very stable. While the tactics of repression used by the Colonial Government were often very heavy handed, locals who cooperated with the economic and educational policies of the Governor-General saw a significant improvement in their standard of living. As a result, the population and living standards of Taiwan during the 50 years of Japanese rule displayed significant growth.\n\n===Economic===\nTaiwan's economy during Japanese rule was, for the most part, a standard colonial economy. Namely, the human and natural resources of Taiwan were used to aid the development of Japan, a policy which began under Governor-General Kodama and reached its peak in 1943, in the middle of [[World War II]]. From 1900 to 1920, Taiwan's economy was dominated by the sugar industry, while from 1920 to 1930, rice was the primary export. During these two periods, the primary economic policy of the Colonial Government was \"industry for Japan, agriculture for Taiwan\". After 1930, due to war needs the Colonial Government began to pursue a policy of industrialization.<ref name=gio7 /> Under the 7th governor, Akashi Motojiro, a vast swamp in central Taiwan was transformed into a huge dam in order to build a hydraulic power plant for industrialization. The dam and its surrounding area, widely known as {{nihongo4|[[Sun Moon Lake]]|\u65e5\u6708\u6f6d|Nichigetsutan}} today, has become a must-see for foreign tourists visiting Taiwan.\n\nAlthough the main focus of each of these periods differed, the primary goal throughout the entire time was increasing Taiwan's productivity to satisfy demand within Japan, a goal which was successfully achieved. As part of this process, new ideas, concepts, and values were introduced to the Taiwanese; also, several public works projects, such as railways, public education, and telecommunications, were implemented. As the economy grew, society stabilized, politics was gradually liberalized, and popular support for the colonial government began to increase. Taiwan thus served as a showcase for Japan's propaganda on the colonial efforts throughout Asia, as displayed during the [[The Taiwan Exposition: In Commemoration of the First Forty Years of Colonial Rule|1935 Taiwan Exposition]].{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\n===Fiscal===\n[[File:Bank of Taiwan Head Office Building 1940.jpg|thumb|250px|Bank of Taiwan established in 1897 and headquartered in Taihoku (formerly Taipeh, modern-day Taipei)]]\n\nShortly after the cession of Taiwan to Japanese rule in September 1895, an [[Osaka]] bank opened a small office in Kirun ([[Keelung]]). By June of the following year the Governor-General had granted permission for the bank to establish the first Western-style banking system in Taiwan.\n\nIn March 1897, the [[Japanese Diet]] passed the \"Taiwan Bank Act\", establishing the [[Bank of Taiwan]], which began operations in 1899. In addition to normal banking duties, the Bank would also be responsible for minting the currency used in Taiwan throughout Japanese rule. The function of central bank was fulfilled by the Bank of Taiwan.<ref name=\"Metzler2006\">{{cite book|author=Mark Metzler|title=Lever of Empire: The International Gold Standard and the Crisis of Liberalism in Prewar Japan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NRHlkwQ0JH4C&pg=PA179&dq=japanese+machine+gun+taiwan&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjc6enkyd7TAhWJ6yYKHVnyBE4Q6AEIXzAJ#v=onepage&q=japanese%20machine%20gun%20taiwan&f=false|date=13 March 2006|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-93179-4|pages=179\u2013}}</ref>\n\nTo maintain fiscal stability, the Colonial Government proceeded to charter several other banks, [[credit unions]], and other financial organizations which helped to keep inflation in check.\n\n===Compulsory education===\nAs part of the colonial government's overall goal of keeping the anti-Japanese movement in check, [[public education]] became an important mechanism for facilitating both control and intercultural dialogue. While secondary education institutions were restricted mostly to Japanese nationals, the impact of compulsory primary education on the Taiwanese was immense.\n\nOn July 14, 1895, [[Isawa Sh\u016bji]] was appointed as the first Education Minister, and proposed that the Colonial Government implement a policy of compulsory primary education for children (a policy that had not even been implemented in Japan at the time). The Colonial Government established the first Western-style primary school in Taipei (the modern-day Shilin Elementary School) as an experiment. Satisfied with the results, the government ordered the establishment of fourteen language schools in 1896, which were later upgraded to become public schools. During this period, schools were segregated by ethnicity. {{nihongo3|public schools|{{linktext|\u516c\u5b78\u6821}}|K\u014dgakk\u014d}} were established for Taiwanese children, while {{nihongo3|elementary schools|{{linktext|\u5c0f\u5b78\u6821}}|sh\u014dgakk\u014d}} were restricted to the children of Japanese nationals. Schools for aborigines were also established in aboriginal areas. Criteria were established for teacher selection, and several teacher training schools such as [[National Taiwan Normal University|Taihoku Normal School]] were founded. Secondary and [[post-secondary education]]al institutions, such as [[Taihoku Imperial University]] were also established, but access was restricted primarily to Japanese nationals. The emphasis for locals was placed on [[vocational education]], to help increase productivity.\n\nThe education system was finally desegregated in March 1941, when all schools (except for a few aboriginal schools) were reclassified as {{nihongo3|National schools|\u570b\u6c11\u5b78\u6821|[[kokumin gakk\u014d]]}}, open to all students regardless of ethnicity. Education was compulsory for children between the ages of eight and fourteen. Subjects taught included {{nihongo4|Morals|\u4fee\u8eab|sh\u016bshin}}, {{nihongo4|Composition|\u4f5c\u6587|sakubun}}, {{nihongo4|Reading|\u8b80\u66f8|dokusho}}, {{nihongo4|Writing|\u7fd2\u5b57|sh\u016bji}}, {{nihongo4|Mathematics|\u7b97\u8853|sanjutsu}}, {{nihongo4|Singing|\u5531\u6b4c|sh\u014dka}}, and {{nihongo4|Physical Education|\u9ad4\u64cd|tais\u014d}}.\n\nBy 1944, there were 944 primary schools in Taiwan with total enrollment rates of 71.3% for Taiwanese children, 86.4% for aboriginal children, and 99.6% for Japanese children in Taiwan. As a result, primary school enrollment rates in Taiwan were among the highest in Asia, second only to Japan itself.<ref name=gio7 />\n\n===Population===\nAs part of the emphasis placed on governmental control, the Colonial Government performed detailed censuses of Taiwan every five years starting in 1905. Statistics showed a population growth rate of 0.988 to 2.835% per year throughout Japanese rule. In 1905, the population of Taiwan was roughly 3 million.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Takekoshi |first1=Yosabur\u014d |authorlink=Takekoshi Yosabur\u014d |title=Japanese rule in Formosa |date=1907 |publisher = Longmans, Green, and co. |publication-place = London, New York, Bombay and Calcutta |ol=6986981M |oclc=753129 |chapter=Chapter XIII: Population and future development of the island resources |chapterurl=https://archive.org/stream/japaneseruleinf01takegoog#page/n230/mode/1up |ref=harv}}</ref> By 1940 the population had grown to 5.87&nbsp;million, and by the end of [[World War II]] in 1946 it numbered 6.09&nbsp;million.\n\n==Transportation developments==\n[[File:The grand sight of Taichu Station.jpg|thumb|Taich\u016b Station (now \"Former [[Taichung TRA station|Taichung Station]]\"), constructed in 1917]]\n\nThe Office of the Governor-General also placed a strong emphasis on modernization of Taiwan's transportation systems, especially railways, and to a lesser extent, highways. As a result, reliable transit links were established between the northern and southern ends of the island, supporting the increasing population.\n\n===Railways===\n{{See also|Rail transport in Taiwan}}\n\nAfter Taiwan was ceded to Japan, the [[Taiwanese push car railways|push car railways]] were introduced in Taiwan. The push car railways were in general service from 1895 to the late 1940s.\n\nThe Railway Ministry (predecessor of the modern [[Taiwan Railway Administration]]) was established on November 8, 1899, beginning a period of rapid expansion of the island's rail network. Perhaps the greatest achievement of this era was the completion of the [[Western Line, Taiwan|Western Line]], linking the major cities along the western corridor in 1908, reducing the travel time between northern and southern Taiwan from several days to a single day.\n\n[[File:Railway Ministry Building, Taiwan.jpg|thumb|The Railway Ministry building]]\n\nAlso constructed during this time were the {{nihongo4|Tansui Line|\u6de1\u6c34\u7dda||modern-day [[Tamsui Line (TRTS)|Tamsui Line]], [[Taipei Metro]]}}, {{nihongo4|Giran Line|\u5b9c\u862d\u7dda||[[Yilan Line]]}}, {{nihongo4|Heit\u014d Line|\u5c4f\u6771\u7dda||[[Pingtung Line]]}}, and {{nihongo4|T\u014dk\u014d Line|\u6771\u6e2f\u7dda||[[Donggang Line]]}}. Several private rail lines were also incorporated into the state owned system. Industrial lines such as the [[Alishan Forest Railway]] were also built. Plans were also drawn up for the [[North-Link Line]], [[South-Link Line]], as well as a line running through the mountains of central Taiwan, but were never realized due to technical difficulties as well as the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Private railways such as the [[Taiwan Sugar Railways]] (built to support the [[sugarcane]] industry), were also built.\n\nLike many other government offices, the Railway Ministry was headed by [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrats]]. Many of the railways constructed during Japanese rule continue to be used today.\n\n===Highways===\nCompared to the rapid development of the rail system, the highway system saw much less attention. However, faced with increasing competition from motorcars, the Railway Ministry began purchasing and confiscating roads running parallel to railways.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}\n\nBus service was available in urban areas, but since the cities in Taiwan were quite small at the time, they remained secondary to rail service. Most bus routes of the time centered on local [[railway stations]].\n\n==Social policy==\n[[File:Pu-Zi-Temple-Beitou-Taipei-.jpg|thumb|The Old Puji Temple (\u666e\u6fdf\u5bfa) in Beitou, Taipei, constructed during Japanese rule]]\n\nWhile the idea of \"special governance\" promoted by Got\u014d dominated most policy decisions made by the colonial authorities, the ultimate goal remained modernization. Under these ideals, the colonial government, along with community groups, would gradually push to modernize Taiwanese society. The main thrust of these efforts targeted what were known as the \"Three Bad Habits\".\n\n===\"Three Vices\"===\nThe \"Three Vices\" ({{lang|zh-hant|\u4e09\u5927\u964b\u7fd2}}) considered by the Office of the Governor-General to be archaic and unhealthy were the use of [[opium]], [[foot binding]], and the wearing of [[Queue (hairstyle)|queues]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Wu |first=Wen-shing (\u5433\u6587\u661f) |title=\u8fd1\u4ee3\u53f0\u7063\u7684\u793e\u6703\u8b8a\u9077 |trans-title=Recent Changes in Taiwanese Society}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Wu |first=Mi-cha |title=\u53f0\u7063\u53f2\u5c0f\u4e8b\u5178 |trans-title=A Brief Timeline of Major Incidents in Taiwanese History |publisher=\u9060\u6d41\u51fa\u7248 |date=2000 |isbn=9789573241614}}</ref>  Much like mainland China in the late nineteenth century, opium addiction was a serious social problem in Taiwan, with some statistics suggesting that over half of the ethnic Chinese population of Taiwan were users of the drug.  The intentional disfigurement of female feet through binding was common to mainland Chinese and Taiwanese society at the time, and the queue hairstyle worn by the male population was forced upon [[Han Chinese]] by the [[Manchu]] rulers of the Qing dynasty ([[Queue (hairstyle)#Queue Order|Queue Order]]).\n\n====Opium====\nShortly after acquiring Taiwan in 1895, then Prime Minister [[It\u014d Hirobumi]] ordered that opium should be banned in Taiwan as soon as possible. However, due to the pervasiveness of opium addiction in Taiwanese society at the time, and the social and economic problems caused by complete prohibition, the initial hard line policy was relaxed in a few years. On January 21, 1897, the Colonial Government issued the Taiwan Opium Edict mandating a government monopoly of the opium trade, and restricting the sale of opium to those with government issued permits, with the ultimate goal of total abolition. The number of opium addicts in Taiwan quickly dropped from millions to 169,064 in 1900 (6.3% of the total population at the time), to 45,832 (1.3% of the population) by 1921. However, the numbers were still higher than those in nations where opium was completely prohibited. It was generally believed that one important factor behind the Colonial Government's reluctance to completely ban opium was the potential profit to be made through a state run [[narcotics]] monopoly.\n\nIn 1921, the [[Taiwanese People's Party]] accused colonial authorities before the [[League of Nations]] of being complacent in the addiction of over 40,000 people, while making a profit off opium sales. To avoid controversy, the Colonial Government issued the New Taiwan Opium Edict on December 28, and related details of the new policy on January 8 of the following year. Under the new laws, the number of opium permits issued was decreased, a [[drug rehab|rehabilitation clinic]] was opened in Taihoku, and a concerted anti-drug campaign launched.<ref>Government figures show 2,000 opium permits issued in 1945.</ref> Despite the directive, the government remained involved with the opium trade until June 1945.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Han Cheung|title=Taiwan in Time: The \u2018war\u2019 on opium|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2017/01/15/2003663122|accessdate=15 January 2017|work=Taipei Times|date=15 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Foot binding====\n[[Foot binding]] was a practice fashionable in [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty]] China. Young girls' feet, usually at age six but often earlier, were wrapped in tight bandages so they could not grow normally, would break and become deformed as they reached adulthood. The feet would remain small and dysfunctional, prone to infection, [[paralysis]], and muscular [[atrophy]]. While such feet were considered by some to be beautiful, others considered the practice to be archaic and barbaric. In concert with community leaders, the Colonial Government launched an anti-foot binding campaign in 1901. The practice was formally banned in 1915, with violators subject to heavy punishment. Foot binding in Taiwan died out quickly afterwards.\n\n====Queue====\nThe Colonial Government took comparatively less action on [[Queue (hairstyle)|queues]]. While social campaigns against wearing queues were launched, no edicts or laws were issued on the subject. With the fall of the [[Qing dynasty]] in 1911, the popularity of queues also decreased.\n\n===Urban planning===\nThe Colonial Government initially focused on pressing needs such as [[sanitation]] and military fortifications. Plans for [[urban development]] began to be issued in 1899, calling for a five-year development plan for most medium and large sized cities. The first phase of urban redevelopment focused on the construction and improvement of roads. In Taihoku (Taipei), the old [[city walls]] were demolished, and the new {{nihongo3||\u897f\u9580\u753a|Seimonch\u014d|modern-day [[Ximending]]}} area was developed for new Japanese immigrants.\n\nThe second phase of urban development began in 1901, focusing on the areas around the South and East Gates of Taihoku and the areas around the railway station in Taich\u016b (Taichung). Primary targets for improvement included roads and [[storm drain|drainage systems]], in preparation for the arrival of more Japanese immigrants.\n\nAnother phase began in August 1905 and also included Tainan. By 1917, urban redevelopment programs were in progress in over seventy cities and towns throughout Taiwan. Many of the urban plans laid out during these programs continue to be used in Taiwan today.\n\n===Public health===\nIn the early years of Japanese rule, the Colonial Government ordered the construction of public [[clinics]] throughout Taiwan and brought in doctors from Japan to halt the spread of [[infectious disease]]. The drive was successful in eliminating diseases such as [[malaria]], [[Bubonic plague|plague]], and [[tuberculosis]] from the island. The [[public health]] system throughout the years of Japanese rule was dominated primarily by small local clinics rather than large central hospitals, a situation which would remain constant in Taiwan until the 1980s.\n\nThe Colonial Government also expended a great deal of effort in developing an effective [[Sanitation|sanitation system]] for Taiwan. British experts were hired to design storm drains and [[sewage system]]s. The expansion of streets and sidewalks, as well as building codes calling for windows allowing for air flow, mandatory neighborhood cleanups, and [[quarantine]] of the ill also helped to improve public health.\n\nPublic health education also became important in schools as well as in law enforcement. The [[Taihoku Imperial University]] also established a Tropical Medicine Research Center, and formal training for [[nurses]].\n\n===Aborigines===\n{{See also|Taiwanese aborigines}}\n\nAccording to the 1905 census, the [[Taiwanese aborigines|aboriginal]] population included 45,000+ plains aborigines{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} who were almost completely assimilated into [[Han Chinese]] society, and 113,000+ mountain aborigines.<ref>{{cite web| title=\u53f0\u6e7e\u7dcf\u7763\u5e9c\u7d71\u8a08\u66f8. \u7b2c15\uff08\u660e\u6cbb44\u5e74\uff09|trans-title= Governor-General of Taiwan Statistic Yearbook 1911|publisher= Governor-General of Taiwan |year=1913 |url=http://kindai.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/974276|page=36}}</ref> Japanese aboriginal policy focused primarily on the unassimilated latter group, known in Japanese as {{nihongo||\u9ad8\u7802\u65cf|Takasago-zoku}}.\n\nThe aborigines were subject to modified versions of [[criminal law|criminal]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]]. As with the rest of the Taiwanese population, the ultimate goal of the Colonial Government was to assimilate the aborigines into Japanese society through a dual policy of suppression and education. This Japanese policy proved its worth during World War II, when aborigines called to service proved to be the most daring soldiers the empire had ever produced. Their legendary bravery is celebrated by Japanese veterans even today.  Many of them would say they owe their survival to the {{nihongo|||Takasago Hei|[[Takasago Volunteers]]}}.\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Ogon jinja.JPG|thumb|The modern remains of {{nihongo3|[[\u014cgon Shrine]]|\u9ec3\u91d1\u795e\u793e}}, a [[Shinto shrine]] located in [[Jinguashi]], [[New Taipei]]]]\n\nThroughout most of Japanese colonial rule, the Colonial Government chose to promote the existing [[Buddhist]] religion over [[Shintoism]] in Taiwan. It was believed that used properly, religion could accelerate the assimilation of the Taiwanese into Japanese society.\n\nUnder these circumstances, existing [[Buddhist temple]]s in Taiwan were expanded and modified to accommodate Japanese elements of the religion, such as worship of [[Ksitigarbha]] (popular in Japan but not Taiwan at the time). The Japanese also constructed several new Buddhist temples throughout Taiwan, many of which also ended up combining aspects of [[Daoism]] and [[Confucianism]], a mix which still persists in Taiwan today.\n\nIn 1937 with the beginning of the K\u014dminka movement, the government began the promotion of [[Shintoism]] and the limited restriction of other religions.\n\n===Military service===\n{{See also|Taiwanese Imperial Japan Serviceman}}\n\nFor most of the Japanese colonial period, the Taiwanese were banned from service in the military of Imperial Japan.  However, starting in 1937, Taiwanese were permitted to enlist, for support duties.  In 1942 the Imperial Army's and in 1943 the Imperial Navy's respective: ''Special Volunteers Acts'' allowed Taiwanese to volunteer for those services' combat arms.  In 1944 and 1945 respectively those programs were replaced in Taiwan with systematic conscription.  207,183 Taiwanese served in the military of Imperial Japan.  In addition, thousands of aboriginal men volunteered from 1937 onwards, eventually being taken out of support and placed in [[Takasago Volunteers|special commando type units]] due to their skills in jungle warfare.\n\nThe Japanese used Aboriginal and Han Taiwanese women as \"[[comfort women]]\" who served as sex slaves to Japanese troops, along with women from other countries under Japanese colonialism such as Korea and the Philippines.<ref name=\"LoganReeves2008\">{{cite book|author1=William Logan|author2=Keir Reeves|title=Places of Pain and Shame: Dealing with 'Difficult Heritage'|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zX58AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA124&dq=truku&hl=en&sa=X&ei=P0QfVbq1MomWsAXRt4SADA&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=truku&f=false|date=5 December 2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-05149-6|pages=124\u2013}}</ref>\n\nA total of 30,304 servicemen, or 15 percent of those recruited and conscripted from Taiwan, were killed or presumed killed in action. 2nd Lt. [[Lee Teng-hui]] of the Imperial Japanese Army later went on to become the [[Republic of China]]'s president. His elder brother, Lee Teng-Chin, was killed in the Philippines and is enshrined in death along with at least 26,000 other Taiwanese Imperial Japan servicemen and hundreds of [[Takasago Volunteers]], killed or presumed killed in action, in the [[Yasukuni Shrine]] in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]], where everyone who died fighting for modern Japan is honored.\n\n==Culture==\nAfter 1915, [[armed resistance]] against the Japanese colonial government nearly ceased. Instead, spontaneous [[social movements]] became popular. The Taiwanese people organized various modern political, cultural and social clubs, adopting political consciousness with clear intentions to unite people with sympathetic sensibilities. This motivated them to strive for the common targets set up by the social movements. These movements also encouraged improvements in social culture.\n\nBesides Taiwanese literature, which connected with the social movements of the time, the aspect of Western culture which Taiwan most successfully adopted was the [[arts]]. Many famous works of art came out during this time.\n\nPopular culture led by movies, [[popular music]] and puppet theater prevailed for the first time in Taiwan during this period.\n\n===Literature===\n[[File:Loa Ho 1919-20 E-mng.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Loa Ho]], father of the new literature in Taiwan]]\n\nThe period of the second half of the colonial period, 1895 to 1945, is highly remarked as political stability and economic growth which accelerated modernization in Taiwan. The competition between the Japanese colonial Government-General and the native Taiwanese elite in the course of its modernization drew many young Taiwanese dream of being artists in a way of provoking improvement of their social status or cultivation of new knowledge which is more suitable to a modern society. Therefore, due to the trend of the campaign for modernization in Taiwan, many young native Taiwanese students went to study abroad, mostly in Japan from the late 1910s and some went to Paris in the 1930s. And indeed they became the pioneers in the era of the flourish cultural movement in Taiwan. It is irrefutable that literature had extraordinary importance in a socio-political and cultural context in the period from the 1920s to around the 1930s with the growing stimulation between writers and painters through shared interest in learning about modernization.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Clark |first1=John |title=Modernity in Asian Art |date=1993 |publisher=Wild Peony |location=Broadway, NSW |isbn=9780646147734}}</ref> The group of artists, painters including some major artists Chen Qingfen, Yang Shilong, Yang Sanlang and [[Liu Chi-hsiang]], are characterized by westernized artistic expression and their own interpretation of time and place which represents a modern political and as well as cultural movement that were emerged by the landed-gentry who strongly resist against the Japanese colonial governors. One of the Japanese art critics recounts that the steady economic growth and great increase of public interest in art with numerous art exhibitions by single and group artists had attracted both Taiwanese and Taiwan-born Japanese artists return to Taiwan and share their works with audiences.<ref>J. Clark \"Taiwanese Painting Under the Japanese Occupation\", Journal of Oriental Studies, Vol. 25, No.1 (1987)</ref>\n\nTaiwanese students studying in Tokyo firstly restructured [[Enlightenment Society]] in 1918, later renamed the [[New People Society]] after 1920, and this was the manifestation for various upcoming political and social movements in Taiwan. Many new publications, such as \"Taiwanese Literature & Art\" (1934) and \"New Taiwanese Literature\" (1935), started shortly thereafter. These led to the onset of the vernacular movement in the society at large as the modern literary broke away from the classical forms of ancient poetry. In 1915, this group of people, led by [[Lin Hsien-tang]] made an initial and large financial contribution on establishing the [[Taichung Municipal Taichung First Senior High School|first middle school in Taichung]] for the aboriginals and Taiwanese<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lin|first1=Hsien-tang |date=1927 |script-title=zh:\u6797\u737b\u5802\u5148\u751f\u7d00\u5ff5\u96c6|language=Chinese |volume=1 |pages=17\u201322}}; {{cite book |last=Tai |first=Pao-tsun |year=1987 |script-title=zh:\u58eb\u7d33\u578b\u653f\u6cbb\u904b\u52d5\u9818\u5c0e\u8005\u2014\u6797\u737b\u5802 |language=zh |series=\u81fa\u7063\u8fd1\u4ee3\u540d\u4eba\u8a8c |volume=4 |pages=41\u201373 |oclc=18086252}}</ref> and furthermore, they actively engaged to proclaim modernization, the cultural enlightenment and welfare of the island. They were passionate in delivering their political perspective in all sorts of forum covering lectures, seminars, concerts and plays for the population, maybe focusing on enthusiastic younger art students, being held in each season in almost every year. But shortly after, the oversea students returned to the island and they vigorously started to spread the ideas of socialist and proletarian, hence the working class necessitated changes social conditions. In the book of Wenhua xiehui de chengi yu fenlie, Zhang states that in early 1927, the association was broken up and eventually taken over by aggressive proletarian fractions. Many scholars acknowledged possible connections of this movement with the [[May Fourth Movement]] in China.\n\nLiterature movements did not disappear even when they were under censorship by the colonial government-general. In the early 1930s, a famous debate on Taiwanese rural language unfolded formally. This event had numerous lasting effects on Taiwanese literature, language and racial consciousness. In 1930, Taiwanese-Japanese resident [[Huang Shihui]] started the debate on rural literature in Tokyo. He advocated that Taiwanese literature should be about Taiwan, have impact on a wide audience, and use [[Taiwanese Hokkien]]. In 1931, [[Koeh Chhiu-seng]], a resident of Taihoku (Taipei), prominently supported Huang's viewpoint. Koeh started the Taiwanese Rural Language Debate, which advocated literature published in Taiwanese. This was immediately supported by [[Loa Ho]] who is considered as the father of Taiwanese literature. After this, dispute as to whether the literature of Taiwan should use Taiwanese or [[Written vernacular Chinese|Chinese]], and whether the subject matter should concern Taiwan, became the focus of the New Taiwan Literature Movement. However, because of the upcoming war and the pervasive Japanese cultural education, these debates could not develop any further. They finally lost traction under the Japanization policy set by the government.<ref name = pol_movement>\n* {{cite book |last1=Lee |first1=Jim |script-title=zh:\u53f0\u7063\u2500\u6211\u7684\u9078\u64c7 |date=1995 |publisher=\u7389\u5c71\u793e |location=Taipei |isbn=9789579361071 |trans-chapter=National recognition of Taiwanese political movements in the past hundred years |chapter=\u4e00\u767e\u5e74\u4f86\u81fa\u7063\u653f\u6cbb\u904b\u52d5\u4e2d\u7684\u570b\u5bb6\u8a8d\u540c |language=Chinese |pages=73\u2013145}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Zhang |first1=De-shui |script-title=zh:\u6fc0\u52d5!\u81fa\u7063\u7684\u6b77\u53f2 : \u81fa\u7063\u4eba\u7684\u81ea\u570b\u8a8d\u8b58 |date=1992 |publisher=\u524d\u885b |location=Taipei |isbn=9789579512756 |language=Chinese |trans-title=Excitement!

This literature and art movement was political in its implications. Also many historians highlights developments in modern drama and literature with the intimate integration between the art worlds of Tokyo and Taipei in the 1930s. From 1935 literacy writers and visual artists began to closely stimulate each other and looked to society for support. Mostly the novels were renowned for its distinct nationalist and social realistic expression whilst painting haven't produced works that merely decorators of the colonial period.\n\nAfter the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] in 1937, the government of Taiwan immediately instituted \"National Spirit General Mobilization\", which formally commenced the Japanization policy.\n\nTaiwanese writers could then only rely on organizations dominated by Japanese writers, for example the \"Taiwanese Poet Association\" which was established in 1939, and the \"Association of Taiwanese Literature & Art\", expanded in 1940.<ref name= pol_movement /> This is because after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese war, re-introduction of military rule in 1937 terminated the development of art and cultural movement in Taiwan.\n\nThe movement of literature of modern Taiwan could be simplified by the two major trends; revitalized Chinese writing and modern literature in Japanese language.\n\nTaiwanese literature mainly focused on the Taiwanese spirit and the essence of Taiwanese culture. People in literature and the arts began to think about issues of Taiwanese culture, and attempted to establish a culture that truly belonged to Taiwan. The significant cultural movement throughout the colonial period were led by the young generation who were highly educated in formal Japanese schools. Education played such a key role in supporting the government and to a larger extent, developing economic growth of Taiwan. However, despite the government prime effort in elementary education and normal education, there was a limited number of middle schools, approximately 3 across the whole country, so the preferred choices for graduates were leaving for Tokyo or other cities to get an education. The foreign education of the young students was carried out solely by individuals' self-motivation and support from family. Education abroad got its popularity, particularly from Taichung county, with the endeavor for acquiring skills and knowledge of civilization even under the situation of neither the colonial government nor society being able to guarantee their bright future; with no job plan for these educated people after their return.<ref>{{cite book |oclc=673809296 |script-title=ja:\u53f0\u6e7e\u7dcf\u7763\u5e9c\u5b66\u4e8b\u5e74\u5831. \u7b2c\uff12\uff15\uff08\u662d\u548c\u5143\u5e74\u5ea6\uff09 |title=Taiwan s\u014dtokufu gakuji nenp\u014d |volume=25 |year=1927 |publisher=\u53f0\u6e7e\u7dcf\u7763\u5e9c\u6587\u6559\u5c40 |location=Taihoku/Taipei |language=Japanese |pages=50\u20131 |url=http://kindai.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/1447981/50}}; {{cite book |script-title=ja:\u53f0\u6e7e\u7dcf\u7763\u5e9c\u5b66\u4e8b\u5e74\u5831 |volume=28 |year=1930 |publisher=\u53f0\u6e7e\u7dcf\u7763\u5e9c\u6587\u6559\u5c40 |location=Taihoku/Taipei |language=Japanese |page=46}}</ref>\n\n===Western art===\n[[File:Chen 1927b Chiayi.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Outside of Chiayi Street/ Tan Ting-pho/ 1926/ Painting on canvas/ 64x53cm/ Selected as part of the 7th Imperial Japanese Exhibition]]\n\nDuring the [[Qing dynasty]], the concept of Western art did not exist in Taiwan. Painting was not a highly respected occupation, and even Chinese landscape painting was undeveloped. When the Japanese began their colonization of Taiwan in 1895, they brought in a new educational system which introduced Western and Japanese art education. This not only set the basis for the future development of art appreciation in Taiwan, it also produced various famous artists. Painter and instructor [[Ishikawa Kinichiro]] contributed immensely in planning the training of new art teachers. He personally instructed students and encouraged them to travel to Japan to learn the more sophisticated techniques of art.\n\nIn 1926, a Taiwanese student in Japan named [[Tan Ting-pho]] published a work titled ''Outside of Chiayi Street'' (see left). His work was selected for display in the seventh [[Imperial Japanese Exhibition]]. This was the first Western-style work by a Taiwanese artist to be included in a Japanese exhibition. Many other works were subsequently featured in the Imperial Japanese Exhibitions and other exhibitions. These successes made it easier for the arts to become widespread in Taiwan. Ironically, the Japanese-appreciated Chen was executed by the Chinese after World War II without trial for being a \"bandit\".\n\nWhat really established the arts in Taiwan was the introduction of official Japanese exhibitions in Taiwan. In 1927, the governor of Taiwan, along with artists Ishikawa Kinichiro, [[Shiotsuki Toho]] and [[Kinoshita Shizukishi]] established the [[Taiwanese Art Exhibition]].<ref>This exhibition was held ten times from 1927 to 1936. It did not occur in 1937, due to the Second Sino-Japanese War.  After 1938, the exhibition was held by the government of Taiwan, and was renamed \"Taiwan Government Art Exhibition\".</ref> This exhibition was held sixteen times from 1938 to 1945. It cultivated the first generation of Taiwanese western artists. The regional Taiwanese art style developed by the exhibition still affected various fields, e.g. art, art design, and engineering design, even after the war.\n\n===Cinema===\n[[File:\u838e\u52c7\u4e4b\u9418.jpg|200px|right|thumb|''Sayon's Bell'', a Japanese movie produced in Taiwan during this period]]\n\nFrom 1901 to 1937, [[Cinema of Taiwan|Taiwanese cinema]] was influenced immensely by [[Japanese cinema]]. Because of Taiwan's status as a Japanese colony, the traditions of Japanese movies were generally accepted by Taiwanese producers. For instance, the use of a ''[[benshi]]'' (narrator of silent films), which was a very important component of the film-going experience in Japan, was adopted and renamed ''piansu'' by the Taiwanese. This narrator was very different from its equivalent in the Western world. It rapidly evolved into a star system. In fact, people would go to see the very same film narrated by different benshi, to hear the other benshi's interpretation. A romance could become a comedy or a drama, depending on the narrator's style and skills.\n\nThe first Taiwan-made film was a documentary produced in February 1907 by [[Takamatsu Toyojiro]], with a group of photographers that traveled through various areas in Taiwan. Their production was called \"Description of Taiwan\", and it covered through subjects such as city construction, electricity, agriculture, industry, mining, railways, education, landscapes, traditions, and conquest of aborigines. The first movie drama produced by Taiwanese was called \"Whose Fault?\" in 1925, produced by the Association of Taiwanese Cinema Research. Other types of films including educational pieces, newsreels and propaganda also helped form the mainstream of local Taiwanese movie productions until the defeat of Japan in 1945. ''[[Sayon's Bell]]'', which depicted an aboriginal maid helping Japanese, was a symbolic production that represents these types of films.\n\nIn 1908, Takamatsu Toyojiro settled in Taiwan and began to construct theaters in the main cities. Takamatsu also signed with several Japanese and foreign movie companies and set up institutionalized movie publication. In 1924, theaters in Taiwan imported advanced [[intertitle]] technique from Japan, and the cinema in Taiwan grew more prominent. On October 1935, a celebration of the fortieth anniversary of annexation in Taiwan was held. The year after, Taipei and [[Fukuoka, Fukuoka|Fukuoka]] were connected by airway. These two events pushed the Taiwanese cinema into its golden age.\n\n===Popular music===\nPopular music in Taiwan was established in the 1930s. Although published [[gramophone record|records]] and [[popular songs]] already existed in Taiwan before the 1930s, the quality and popularity of most of them was very poor. This was mainly because popular songs at the time differed slightly from traditional music like [[Folk song|folk songs]] and [[Taiwanese opera]]. However, because of the rapid development of cinema and broadcasting during the 1930s, new [[popular songs]] that stepped away from traditional influences began to appear and become widespread in a short period of time.\n\nThe first accepted eminent popular song in Taiwan collocated with the [[Chinese movie]], ''[[The Peach Girl]]'' (Tao hua qi xie ji). Produced by [[Lianhua Film Company|Lianhua Productions]], ''The Peach Girl'', starring [[Ruan Lingyu]], screened in Taiwan theaters in 1932. Hoping to attract more Taiwanese viewers, the producers requested composers [[Zhan Tianma]] and [[Wang Yunfeng]] to compose a song with the same title. The song that came out was a major hit and achieved success in record sales. From this period on, Taiwanese popular music with the assistance of cinema began to rise.\n\n===Puppet theater===\n{{Main|Glove puppetry}}\n\nMany [[Hokkien]]-speaking immigrants entered Taiwan during the 1750s, and with them they brought puppet theatre. The stories were based mainly on classical books and stage dramas and were very refined. Artistry focused on the complexity of the puppet movements.  Musical accompaniment was generally [[Nanguan music|Nanguan]] and [[Beiguan music|Beiguan]] music. According to the ''Records of Taiwan Province'', Nanguan was the earliest form of puppet theatre in Taiwan. Although this kind of puppet theatre fell out of the mainstream, it can still be found in a few troupes around [[Taipei]] today.\n\n[[File:Taiwan-Puppet-Monkey-god2.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Puppet theatre, an important cultural entertainment during Japanese rule]]\n\nDuring the 1920s, [[wuxia]] puppet theatre (i.e. based on martial arts) gradually developed. The stories were the main difference between traditional and wuxia puppet theatre. Based on new, popular wuxia novels, performances focused on the display of unique martial arts by the puppets. The representative figures during this era were [[Huang Haidai]] of Wuzhouyuan and [[Zhong Renxiang]] of Xinyige. This puppet genre began its development in [[Yunlin]]'s [[Huwei]] and [[Xiluo]] towns, and was popularized in southern-central Taiwan. Huang Haidai's puppet theatre was narrated in Hokkien, and included poems, historical narrative, [[couplet]]s and riddles. Its performance blended Beiguan, Nanguan, Luantan, Zhengyin, Gezai and Chaodiao music.\n\nAfter the 1930s, the Japanization policy affected puppet theatre. The customary Chinese Beiguan was forbidden, and was replaced with Western music. The costumes and the puppets were a mixture of Japanese and Chinese style. The plays often included Japanese stories like [[Mitokomon]] and others, with the puppets dressed in Japanese clothing. Performances were presented in Japanese. These new linguistic and cultural barriers reduced public acceptance, but introduced techniques which subsequently influenced the future development of the [[Golden Light puppet theatre]], including music and stage settings.\n\nDuring this era, the world of puppet theatre in southern Taiwan had the '''Five Great Pillars''' and '''Four Great Celebrities'''. The \"Five Great Pillars\" referred to Huang Haidai, Zhong Renxiang, Huang Tianquan, Hu Jinzhu and Lu Chongyi; the \"Four Great Celebrities\" referred to Huang Tianchuan, Lu Chongyi, Li Tuyuan and Zheng Chuanming.\n\n===Baseball===\nThe Japanese also brought baseball to Taiwan. There were baseball teams in elementary schools as well as public schools, and the Japanese built baseball fields such as [[Tainan Stadium]]. It became such a widespread sport that, by the early 1930s, nearly all major secondary schools and many primary schools had established representative baseball teams. The development of the game in Taiwan culminated when a [[Kano Baseball Team|team from Kagi N\u014drin Gakk\u014d]], an agriculture and forestry high school, ranked second in Japan's \"K\u014dshien\" national high-school baseball tournament. One legacy of this era today are the careers of several professional baseball players, such as [[Chien-Ming Wang]], [[Hong-Chih Kuo]], [[Tzu-Wei Lin]], and [[Chien-Ming Chiang]].\n\n== Change of governing authority ==\n{{See also|Surrender of Japan|Political status of Taiwan}}\n\n[[File:Ando Rikichi surrender.jpg|thumb|right|[[Chen Yi (Kuomintang)|Chen Yi]] (right) accepting the receipt of Order No. 1 signed by [[Rikichi And\u014d]] (left), the last Japanese Governor-General of Taiwan, in [[Zhongshan Hall|Taipei City Hall]]]]\n\nWith the end of [[World War II]], Taiwan was placed under the administrative control of the [[Republic of China]] by the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] ([[UNRRA]]) after 50 years of colonial rule by Japan. [[Chen Yi (Kuomintang)|Chen Yi]], the ROC Chief Executive of Taiwan, arrived on October 24, 1945, and received the last Japanese Governor-General, [[And\u014d Rikichi]], who signed the document of surrender on the next day, which was proclaimed by Chen as \"[[Retrocession Day]]\". This turned out to be legally controversial since Japan did not renounce its sovereignty over Taiwan until April 28, 1952, with the coming into force of the [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]], which further complicated the [[political status of Taiwan]]. As a result, use of the term \"Retrocession of Taiwan\" ({{zh|t=\u81fa\u7063\u5149\u5fa9|p=T\u00e1iw\u0101n gu\u0101ngf\u00f9}}) is less common in modern Taiwan.\n\n===Background===\nAt the [[Cairo Conference (1943)|Cairo Conference]] of 1943, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] adopted a statement declaring that Japan will give up Taiwan at the end of the war. In April 1944, the ROC government at the wartime capital of [[Chongqing]] established the Taiwan Research Committee ({{zh|t=\u81fa\u7063\u8abf\u67e5\u59d4\u54e1\u6703|p=T\u00e1iw\u0101n di\u00e0och\u00e1 w\u011biyu\u00e1nhu\u00ec|labels=no}}) with [[Chen Yi (Kuomintang)|Chen Yi]] as chairman. Shortly afterwards, the committee reported its findings on the economy, politics, society, and military affairs of Taiwan to Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]].\n\nFollowing the war, opinion in the ROC government was split as to the administration of Taiwan. One faction supported treating Taiwan in the same way as other Chinese territories occupied by the Japanese during [[World War II]], creating a [[Taiwan Province]]. The other faction supported establishing a [[Special administrative regions of China#ROC special administrative regions|special administrative region]] in Taiwan with special military and police powers. In the end, Chiang Kai-shek chose to take Chen Yi's suggestion of creating a special 2000 man \"Office of the Chief Executive of Taiwan Province\" ({{zh |t = \u81fa\u7063\u7701\u884c\u653f\u9577\u5b98\u516c\u7f72 |p = T\u00e1iw\u0101n Sh\u011bng X\u00edngzh\u00e8ng Zh\u01cenggu\u0101n G\u014dngsh\u01d4 |labels = no }}) to handle the transfer.\n\nJapan formally [[Surrender of Japan|surrendered]] to the Allies on August 14, 1945. On August 29, Chiang Kai-shek appointed Chen Yi as Chief Executive of Taiwan Province, and announced the creation of the Office of the Chief Executive of Taiwan Province and [[Taiwan Garrison Command]] on September 1, with Chen Yi also as the commander of the latter body. After several days of preparation, an advance party moved into Taipei on October 5, with more personnel from Shanghai and Chungking arriving between October 5 and 24. By 1938 about 309,000 Japanese lived in [[Taiwan]].<ref>{{cite journal |title = Formosa (Taiwan) Under Japanese Rule |first=A.

1895 and 1945.\n\nTaiwan became a [[Dependent territory|dependency]] of Japan in 1895 when the [[Qing dynasty]] of China ceded [[Taiwan Province]] in the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] after Japanese

In 1609, the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]] sent [[Arima Harunobu ]] on an exploratory mission of the island. In 1616, [[Murayama Toan]] led an unsuccessful invasion of the island.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nIn November 1871, 69 people on board a vessel from the [[Ryukyu Kingdom|Kingdom of Ryukyu]] were forced to land near the southern tip of Taiwan by strong winds.

In October 1872, Japan sought compensation from the Qing dynasty of China, claiming the Kingdom of [[Ryukyu]] was part of Japan. In May 1873, Japanese diplomats arrived in Beijing and put forward their claims, but the Qing government immediately rejected Japanese demands on the ground that the Kingdom of [[Ryukyu]] at that time was an independent state and had nothing to do with Japan. The Japanese refused to leave and asked if the Chinese government would punish those \"barbarians in Taiwan\".{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nThe Qing authorities explained that there were two kinds of aborigines on Taiwan: those directly governed by the Qing, and those unnaturalized \"raw barbarians... beyond the reach of Chinese culture. Thus could not be directly regulated.\" They indirectly hinted that foreigners traveling in those areas settled by indigenous people must exercise caution. The Qing dynasty made it clear to the Japanese that Taiwan was definitely within Qing jurisdiction, even though part of that island's aboriginal population was not yet under the influence of Chinese culture. The Qing also pointed to similar cases all over the world where an aboriginal population within a national boundary was not under the influence of the dominant culture of that country.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Zhao |first1=Jiaying |script-title=zh:\u4e2d\u56fd\u8fd1\u4ee3\u5916\u4ea4\u53f2 |date=1994 |publisher=\u5c71\u897f\u9ad8\u6821\u8054\u5408\u51fa\u7248\u793e |location=Taiyuan |isbn=9787810325776 |edition=1st |language=Chinese |trans-title=A Diplomatic History of China}}</ref>\n\nThe Japanese nevertheless launched an [[Taiwan expedition of 1874|expedition]] to Taiwan, with a force of 3,000 soldiers in April 1874.

The [[First Sino-Japanese War]] broke out between [[Qing dynasty]] China and Japan in 1894 following a dispute over the sovereignty of [[Korea]]. Following its defeat, China ceded the islands of Taiwan and [[Pescadores|Penghu]] to Japan in the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]], signed on April 17, 1895. According to the terms of the treaty, Taiwan and Penghu (isles between 119\u02daE-120\u02daE and 23\u02daN-24\u02daN) were to be ceded to Japan in perpetuity. Both governments were to send representatives to Taiwan immediately after signing to begin the transition process, which was to be completed in no more than two months. Because Taiwan was ceded by treaty, the period that followed is referred to by some as the \"colonial period\", while others who focus on the fact that it was the culmination of a war refer to it as the \"occupation period\".  The cession ceremony took place on board a Japanese vessel because the Chinese delegate feared reprisal from the residents of Taiwan.{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|p=293}}\n\nThough the terms dictated by Japan were harsh, it is reported{{by whom|date=April 2016}} that Qing China's leading statesman, [[Li Hongzhang]], sought to assuage [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] by remarking: \"birds do not sing and flowers are not fragrant on the island of Taiwan.

During this period, popular resistance to Japanese rule was high, and the world questioned whether a non-Western nation such as Japan could effectively govern a colony of its own. An 1897 session of the [[Japanese Diet]] debated whether to sell Taiwan to France.<ref>{{cite book|author=Shaohua Hu|title=Foreign Policies toward Taiwan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TlsvDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT39&dq=In+1897,+the+Japanese+Diet+actually+considered+selling+Taiwan+to+France&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi0qM3Tie3iAhXtmOAKHTENC_8Q6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=In%201897%2C%20the%20Japanese%20Diet%20actually%20considered%20selling%20Taiwan%20to%20France&f=false|year=2018|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-138-06174-3|pages=161\u2013}}</ref> During these years, the post of [[Governor-General of Taiwan]] was held by a military general, as the emphasis was on suppression of the insurgency.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nIn 1898, the [[Meiji government]] of Japan appointed Count [[Kodama Gentar\u014d]] as the fourth Governor-General, with the talented civilian politician [[Got\u014d Shinpei]] as his Chief of Home Affairs, establishing the [[carrot and stick]] approach towards governance that would continue for several years.<ref name=gio7 /> This marked the beginning of a colonial government (formally known as the Office of the Governor-General) dominated by Japanese, but subject to colonial law.\n\nJapan's approach to ruling Taiwan could be roughly divided into two views. The first, supported by Got\u014d, held that from a biological perspective, the natives could not be completely assimilated. Thus, Japan would have to follow the British approach, and Taiwan would never be governed exactly the same way as the [[Japanese archipelago|Home Islands]] but would be governed under a whole new set of laws. The opposing viewpoint was held by future Prime Minister [[Hara Takashi]], who believed that the Taiwanese and Koreans were similar enough to the Japanese to be fully absorbed into Japanese society, and was thus in favor of using the same legal and governmental approaches on the colonies as those used in the Home Islands.\n\nColonial policy towards Taiwan mostly followed the approach championed by Got\u014d during his tenure as Chief of Home Affairs between March 1898 and November 1906, and this approach continued to be in effect until [[Hara Takashi]] became prime minister in 1918. During this period, the colonial government was authorized to pass special laws and edicts, while wielding complete executive, legislative, and military power. With this absolute power, the colonial government moved to maintain social stability, while suppressing dissent.\n\n===D\u014dka: \"Integration\" (1915\u20131937)===\n[[File:Xie Jieshi.JPG|thumb|130px|[[Xie Jishi]], [[Manchukuo]] [[Foreign Minister]]]]\n[[File:Koo Hsien-jung in 1914.JPG|thumb|130px|[[Koo Hsien-jung]], member of the [[House of Peers (Japan)|House of Peers]]]]\n\nThe second period of Japanese rule is generally classified as being between the end of the 1915 [[Ta-pa-ni Incident|Tapani Incident]], and the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] of 1937, which began Japan's involvement in what would become [[World War II]]. World events during this period, such as [[World War I]], would drastically alter the perception of [[colonialism]] in the Western world, and give rise to growing waves of nationalism amongst colonial natives, as well as the ideas of [[self determination]]. As a result, colonial governments throughout the world began to make greater concessions to natives, and colonial governance was gradually liberalized. Taiwan-born [[Xie Jishi]] became a first [[Foreign Minister]] of [[Manchukuo]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}{{relevance inline|date=February 2013}}\n\nThe political climate in Japan was also undergoing changes during this time. In the mid-1910s the Japanese government had gradually democratized in what is known as the [[Taish\u014d period]] (1912\u201325), where power was concentrated in the elected lower house of the [[Japanese Diet|Imperial Diet]], whose electorate was expanded to include all adult males by 1925. In 1919, [[Den Kenjir\u014d]] was appointed to be the first civilian Governor-General of Taiwan. Prior to his departure for Taiwan, he conferred with Prime Minister [[Hara Takashi]], where both men agreed to pursue a policy of {{Nihongo|[[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]]|\u540c\u5316|d\u014dka}}, where Taiwan would be viewed as an extension of the Home Islands, and the Taiwanese would be educated to understand their role and responsibilities as Japanese subjects. The new policy was formally announced in October 1919.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nThis policy was continued by the colonial government for the next 20 years. In the process, local governance was instituted, as well as an elected advisory committee which included locals (though strictly in an advisory capacity), and the establishment of a public school system. [[Caning]] was forbidden as a criminal punishment, and the use of the Japanese language was rewarded. This contrasted sharply with the mostly hands-off approach taken by previous administrations towards local affairs, where the only government concerns were \"railways, [[vaccinations]], and [[running water]]\".{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\n==== Chinese diplomacy ==== <!-- Anchor from redirected [Chinese Consulate-General, Taihoku] article; caution. -->\nThe Consulate-General of the Republic of China in [[Taihoku Prefecture|Taihoku]] (modern-day [[Taipei]]) was a diplomatic mission of the [[government of the Republic of China]] (ROC) that opened April 6, 1931, and closed in 1945 after the [[Taiwan Retrocession Day|handover]] of Taiwan to the ROC.

With the rise of [[Militarism-Socialism in Sh\u014dwa Japan|militarism in Japan]] in the mid-to-late 1930s, the office of Governor-General was again held by military officers, and Japan sought to use resources and material from Taiwan in the war effort. To this end, the cooperation of the Taiwanese would be essential, and the Taiwanese would have to be fully assimilated as members of Japanese society. As a result, earlier social movements were banned and the Colonial Government devoted its full efforts to the {{nihongo4|\"K\u014dminka movement\"|\u7687\u6c11\u5316\u904b\u52d5|k\u014dminka und\u014d}}, aimed at fully Japanizing Taiwanese society.<ref name=gio7 /> Between 1936 and 1940, the K\u014dminka movement sought to build {{nihongo4|\"Japanese spirit\"|\u5927\u548c\u9b42|[[Yamato-damashii|Yamatodamash\u012b]]}} and Japanese identity amongst the populace, while the later years from 1941 to 1945 focused on encouraging Taiwanese to participate in the war effort.\n[[File:Advertisement of congratulation towards the establishment of the new Nationalist government on Taiwan Nichi Nichi Shimp\u014d.jpg|thumb|Advertisement of congratulation towards the establishment of the [[Wang Jingwei regime]] on Taiwan Nichi Nichi Shimp\u014d]]\nAs part of the movement, the Colonial Government began to strongly encourage locals to speak the Japanese language, wear [[Japanese clothing]], live in Japanese-style houses, and convert to [[Shintoism]]. In 1940, laws were also passed advocating the adoption of Japanese names. With the expansion of the [[Pacific War]], the government also began encouraging Taiwanese to volunteer for the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Navy]] in 1942, and finally ordered a full scale draft in 1945. In the meantime, laws were made to grant Taiwanese membership in the Japanese Diet, which theoretically would qualify a Taiwanese person to become the premier of Japan eventually.\n[[File:Bombing campaign.

Power was highly centralized with the Governor-General wielding supreme executive, legislative, and judicial power, effectively making the government a dictatorship.<ref name=gio7 />\n\n===Development===\nIn its earliest incarnation, the Colonial Government was composed of three bureaus: Home Affairs, Army, and Navy. The Home Affairs Bureau was further divided into four offices: Internal Affairs, Agriculture, Finance, and Education. The Army and Navy bureaus were merged to form a single Military Affairs Bureau in 1896. Following reforms in 1898, 1901, and 1919 the Home Affairs Bureau gained three more offices: General Affairs, Judicial, and Communications. This configuration would continue until the end of colonial rule.\nThe Japanese colonial government was responsible for building harbors and hospitals as well as constructing infrastructure like railroads and roads. By 1935 the Japanese expanded the roads by 4,456 kilometers, in comparison with the 164 kilometers that existed before the Japanese occupation. The Japanese government invested a lot of money in the sanitation system of the island.

Formulation and development of governmental policy was primarily the role of the central or local bureaucracy.\n\nIn the 50 years of Japanese rule from 1895 to 1945, Tokyo dispatched nineteen Governors-General to Taiwan. On average, a Governor-General served about 2.5 years. The entire colonial period can be further divided into three periods based on the background of the Governor-General: the Early Military period, the Civilian period, and the Later Military period.\n\nGovernors-General from the Early Military period included [[Kabayama Sukenori]], [[Katsura Tar\u014d]], [[Nogi Maresuke]], [[Kodama Gentar\u014d]], [[Sakuma Samata]], [[Ando Sadami]], and [[Akashi Motojiro]]. Two of the pre-1919 Governors-General, Nogi Maresuke and Kodama Gentar\u014d, would become famous in the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. And\u014d Sadami and Akashi Motojir\u014d are generally acknowledged to have done the most for Taiwanese interests during their tenures, with Akashi Motojir\u014d actually requesting in his will that he be buried in Taiwan, [[Akashi Motojiro#Death and burial|which he indeed was]].\n\nThe Civilian period occurred at roughly the same time as the [[Taish\u014d period|Taish\u014d democracy]] in Japan, Governors-General from this period were mostly nominated by the [[Japanese Diet]] and included [[Den Kenjir\u014d]], [[Uchida Kakichi]], [[Izawa Takio]], [[Kamiyama Mitsunoshin]], [[Kawamura Takeji]], [[Ishizuka Eiz\u014d]], [[\u014cta Masahiro]], [[Minami Hiroshi]], and [[Nakagawa Kenz\u014d]].

Instead, this action resulted from strategy during the war with China and from diplomacy carried out in the spring of 1895. Prime Minister Hirobumi's southern strategy, supportive of Japanese navy designs, paved the way for the occupation of [[Penghu Islands]] in late March as a prelude to the takeover of Taiwan. Soon after, while peace negotiations continued, Hirobumi and Mustsu Munemitsu, his minister of foreign affairs, stipulated that both Taiwan and Penghu were to be ceded by imperial China.<ref name=\"Edward I-te Chen\" >{{cite journal |last1=Chen |first1=Edward I-te |title=Japan's Decision to Annex Taiwan: A Study of Ito-Mutsu Diplomacy, 1894\u201395 |journal=The Journal of Asian Studies |date=November 1977 |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=66\u201367 |doi=10.2307/2053328 |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nLi Huang-chang, China's chief diplomat, was forced to accede to these conditions as well as to other Japanese demands, and the Treaty of Shimonoseki was signed on April 17, then duly ratified by the Qing court on 8 May. The formal transference of Taiwan and Penghu took place on a ship off the Keelung coast on June 2. This formality was conducted by Li's adopted son, Li Ching-fang, and Admiral Kabayama Sukenori, a staunch advocate of annexation, whom It\u014d had appointed as governor-general of Taiwan.<ref>A detailed account of the transference of Taiwan, translated from the ''Japan Mail'', appears in {{harvp|Davidson|1903|pp=293\u2013295}}</ref>\n\nThe annexation of Taiwan was also based on practical considerations of benefit to Japan. Tokyo expected the large and productive island to furnish provisions and raw materials for Japan's expanding economy and to become a ready market for Japanese goods. Taiwan's strategic location was deemed advantageous as well. As envisioned by the navy, the island would form a southern bastion of defense from which to safeguard southernmost China and southeastern Asia. These considerations accurately forecast the major roles Taiwan would play in Japan's quest for power, wealth, and great empire.<ref name= Chen>{{harvp|Chen|1977|pp=71\u201372}} argues that It\u014d and Mutsu wanted Japan to gain equality with the Western powers. Japan's decision to annex Taiwan was not based on any long-range design for future aggression.</ref>\n\nMost armed resistance against Japanese rule occurred during the first 20 years of colonial rule. This period of Han and aboriginal resistance is usually divided{{by whom|date=July 2012}} into three stages: the defense of the [[Republic of Formosa]]; guerilla warfare following the collapse of the Republic; and a final stage between the [[Beipu uprising]] of 1907, and the [[Tapani Incident]] of 1915. Afterwards, Han armed resistance was mostly replaced by peaceful forms of cultural and political activism, while the mountain aboriginals continued to carry out armed struggle such as in the [[Musha incident]] in 1930.\n\n===Republic of Formosa===\n[[File:Flag of Formosa 1895.svg|thumb|left|The flag of the Republic of Formosa, 1895]]\n{{See also|Republic of Formosa|Japanese invasion of Taiwan (1895)}}\n\nThe decision by the Qing Chinese government to cede Taiwan to Japan with the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] caused a massive uproar in Taiwan. On 25 May 1895, a group of pro-Qing officials and local gentry declared independence from China, proclaiming a new [[Republic of Formosa]] with the goal of keeping Taiwan under Qing rule, choosing then Qing governor [[Tang Jingsong]] as their reluctant president. In response, Japanese forces [[Japanese Invasion of Taiwan (1895)|landed]] in [[Keelung]] on 29 May, taking the city on 3 June. President Tang and his Vice-President [[Qiu Fengjia]] fled the island for mainland China the following day. Later in the same month, remaining supporters of the new Republic gathered in [[Tainan]] and selected [[Liu Yongfu]] as the second president. The local Taiwanese Han militia units were mobilized to counter the Japanese occupation. After a series of bloody conflicts between the Japanese and local Taiwanese forces, the Japanese had successfully seized Tainan by late October, inflicting heavy casualties on the Taiwanese side. Shortly afterwards, President Liu fled Taiwan for mainland China, bringing the 184-day history of the Republic to an end.\n\n===Guerrillas===\n\n<blockquote>\n\"The cession of the island to Japan was received with such disfavour by the Chinese inhabitants that a large military force was required to effect its occupation. For nearly two years afterwards, a bitter guerrilla resistance was offered to the Japanese troops, and large forces \u2013 over 100,000 men, it was stated at the time \u2013 were required for its suppression. This was not accomplished without much cruelty on the part of the conquerors, who, in their march through the island, perpetrated all the worst excesses of war. They had, undoubtedly, considerable provocation. They were constantly attacked by ambushed enemies, and their losses from battle and disease far exceeded the entire loss of the whole Japanese army throughout the Manchurian campaign. But their revenge was often taken on innocent villagers. Men, women, and children were ruthlessly slaughtered or became the victims of unrestrained lust and rapine. The result was to drive from their homes thousands of industrious and peaceful peasants, who, long after the main resistance had been completely crushed, continued to wage a vendetta war, and to generate feelings of hatred which the succeeding years of conciliation and good government have not wholly eradicated.\" \u2013 ''[[The_Cambridge_Modern_History#XII._The_Latest_Age_(1910)|The Cambridge Modern History]]'', Volume 12<ref name=\"WardProthero1910\">{{cite book|author1=Sir [[Adolphus William Ward]]|author2=[[George Walter Prothero]]|author3=Sir [[Stanley Mordaunt Leathes]]|author4=[[Ernest Alfred Benians]]|title=The Cambridge Modern History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EMBBAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA573|year=1910|publisher=Macmillan|pages=573\u2013}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Republic of Formosa, the Japanese Governor-General [[Kabayama Sukenori]] reported to Tokyo that \"the island is secured\", and proceeded to begin the task of administration. However, in December a series of anti-Japanese uprisings occurred in northern Taiwan, and would continue to occur at a rate of roughly one per month. By 1902, however, most anti-Japanese activity amongst the ethnic Chinese population had died down. Along the way, 14,000 Taiwanese, or 0.5% of the population had been killed.<ref name = msu>{{cite web |title = Taiwan \u2013 History |website = Windows on Asia | publisher = [[Asian Studies Center, Michigan State University]] | url = http://asia.isp.msu.edu/wbwoa/east_asia/taiwan/history.htm |accessdate = 2014-12-22}}</ref>\nTaiwan would remain relatively calm until the Beipu Uprising in 1907.

On October 27, 1930, following escalation of an incident in which a Japanese police officer insulted a tribesman, over 300 [[Seediq people|Seediq]] [[Taiwanese aborigine|aborigines]] under Chief [[Mona Rudao]] attacked Japanese residents in the area. In the ensuing violence, 134 Japanese nationals and two ethnic Han Taiwanese were killed, and 215 Japanese nationals injured. The Han were mistaken for Japanese by the aboriginals since one of the victims, a Han girl, was wearing a Kimono. Many of the victims were attending an athletic festival at Musyaji Elementary School. In response, the colonial government ordered a military crackdown. In the two months that followed, most of the insurgents were either killed or committed suicide, along with their family members or fellow tribesmen. Several members of the government resigned over the incident, which proved to be the most violent of the uprisings during Japanese rule.\n\nLocal administration continued to be strict, however, and not all modifications in governance had liberal overtones. Special criminal statues relating to public order and peace preservation were introduced from Japan, for example.<ref name=\"Tay sheng Wang\"/> These severe enactments also included governmental responses to the peaceful resistance developed in the colony: in particular, to the new modes of protest{{which|date=July 2012}} staged by leaders{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} among the younger generation of Taiwanese.\n\n===Dafen incident===\nThe [[Bunun people|Bunun Aboriginals]] under Chief [[Raho Ari]] [[w:zh:\u62c9\u8377\u00b7\u963f\u96f7|\u62c9\u8377\u00b7\u963f\u96f7]] (l\u0101h\u00e8\u00b7 \u0101l\u00e9i) engaged in guerrilla warfare against the Japanese for twenty years. Raho Ari's revolt, called the Dafen incident [[w:zh:\u5927\u5206\u4e8b\u4ef6]] was sparked when the Japanese implemented a gun control policy in 1914 against the Aboriginals in which their rifles were impounded in police stations when hunting expeditions were over. The revolt began at Dafen when a police platoon was slaughtered by Raho Ari's clan in 1915. A settlement holding 266 people called Tamaho was created by Raho Ari and his followers near the source of the Laonong River and attracted more Bunun rebels to their cause. Raho Ari and his followers captured bullets and guns and slew Japanese in repeated hit and run raids against Japanese police stations by infiltrating over the Japanese \"guardline\" of electrified fences and police stations as they pleased.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=3YOoAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA16&lpg=PA16&dq=Raho+Ari&source=bl&ots=PTYSC8s1X1&sig=C1LuNrDq0TwO2poUsitZyo8vjvw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=gEG3VKV2g66CBMLDgrAB&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Raho%20Ari&f=false Crook 2014], p. 16.</ref>\n\n===Siaolin Incident===\nAs a resistance to the long-term oppression by the Japanese government, many [[Taivoan people]] from Jiaxian led the first local rebellion against Japan in July 1915, called the Jiaxian Incident (\u7532\u4ed9\u57d4\u4e8b\u4ef6). This was followed by a wider rebellion from [[Yuchin Basin]] in [[Tainan]] to [[Jiasian District|Jiasian]] in [[Kaohsiung]] in August 1915, known as the [[Tapani incident|Tapani Incident]] (\u564d\u5427\u54d6\u4e8b\u4ef6) in which more than 1,400 local people died or were killed by the Japanese government. Twenty-two years later, the Taivoan people struggled to carry on another rebellion; since most of the indigenous people were from [[Siaolin Village|Siaolin]], the resistance taking place in 1937 was named the Siaolin Incident (\u5c0f\u6797\u4e8b\u4ef6).<ref>{{Cite book|title=\u7a2e\u56de\u5c0f\u6797\u6751\u7684\u8a18\u61b6 : \u5927\u6b66\u58e0\u6c11\u65cf\u690d\u7269\u66a8\u90e8\u843d\u50b3\u627f400\u5e74\u4eba\u6587\u8a8c (A 400-Year Memory of Xiaolin Taivoan: Their Botany, Their History, and Their People)|last=|first=|publisher=\u9ad8\u96c4\u5e02\u6749\u6797\u5340\u65e5\u5149\u5c0f\u6797\u793e\u5340\u767c\u5c55\u5354\u6703 (Sunrise Xiaolin Community Development Association)|year=2017|isbn=978-986-95852-0-0|location=Kaohsiung City|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Economic and educational development==\n[[File:TaiwanShow1935-2.jpg|thumb|Poster for the 1935 Taiwan Exposition]]\n\nOne of the most notable features of Japanese rule in Taiwan was the \"top-down\" nature of social change. While local activism certainly played a role, most of the social, economic, and cultural changes during this period were driven by [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrats]] in the colonial government. With the Colonial Government as the primary driving force, as well as new immigrants from the Japanese [[Japanese archipelago|Home Islands]], Taiwanese society was sharply divided between the rulers and the ruled.\n\nUnder the constant control of the colonial government, aside from a few small incidents during the earlier years of Japanese rule, Taiwanese society was mostly very stable. While the tactics of repression used by the Colonial Government were often very heavy handed, locals who cooperated with the economic and educational policies of the Governor-General saw a significant improvement in their standard of living. As a result, the population and living standards of Taiwan during the 50 years of Japanese rule displayed significant growth.\n\n===Economic===\nTaiwan's economy during Japanese rule was, for the most part, a standard colonial economy. Namely, the human and natural resources of Taiwan were used to aid the development of Japan, a policy which began under Governor-General Kodama and reached its peak in 1943, in the middle of [[World War II]]. From 1900 to 1920, Taiwan's economy was dominated by the sugar industry, while from 1920 to 1930, rice was the primary export. During these two periods, the primary economic policy of the Colonial Government was \"industry for Japan, agriculture for Taiwan\". After 1930, due to war needs the Colonial Government began to pursue a policy of industrialization.<ref name=gio7 /> Under the 7th governor, Akashi Motojiro, a vast swamp in central Taiwan was transformed into a huge dam in order to build a hydraulic power plant for industrialization. The dam and its surrounding area, widely known as {{nihongo4|[[Sun Moon Lake]]|\u65e5\u6708\u6f6d|Nichigetsutan}} today, has become a must-see for foreign tourists visiting Taiwan.\n\nAlthough the main focus of each of these periods differed, the primary goal throughout the entire time was increasing Taiwan's productivity to satisfy demand within Japan, a goal which was successfully achieved. As part of this process, new ideas, concepts, and values were introduced to the Taiwanese; also, several public works projects, such as railways, public education, and telecommunications, were implemented. As the economy grew, society stabilized, politics was gradually liberalized, and popular support for the colonial government began to increase. Taiwan thus served as a showcase for Japan's propaganda on the colonial efforts throughout Asia, as displayed during the [[The Taiwan Exposition: In Commemoration of the First Forty Years of Colonial Rule|1935 Taiwan Exposition]].{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\n===Fiscal===\n[[File:Bank of Taiwan Head Office Building 1940.jpg|thumb|250px|Bank of Taiwan established in 1897 and headquartered in Taihoku (formerly Taipeh, modern-day Taipei)]]\n\nShortly after the cession of Taiwan to Japanese rule in September 1895, an [[Osaka]] bank opened a small office in Kirun ([[Keelung]]). By June of the following year the Governor-General had granted permission for the bank to establish the first Western-style banking system in Taiwan.\n\nIn March 1897, the [[Japanese Diet]] passed the \"Taiwan Bank Act\", establishing the [[Bank of Taiwan]], which began operations in 1899. In addition to normal banking duties, the Bank would also be responsible for minting the currency used in Taiwan throughout Japanese rule. The function of central bank was fulfilled by the Bank of Taiwan.<ref name=\"Metzler2006\">{{cite book|author=Mark Metzler|title=Lever of Empire: The International Gold Standard and the Crisis of Liberalism in Prewar Japan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NRHlkwQ0JH4C&pg=PA179&dq=japanese+machine+gun+taiwan&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjc6enkyd7TAhWJ6yYKHVnyBE4Q6AEIXzAJ#v=onepage&q=japanese%20machine%20gun%20taiwan&f=false|date=13 March 2006|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-93179-4|pages=179\u2013}}</ref>\n\nTo maintain fiscal stability, the Colonial Government proceeded to charter several other banks, [[credit unions]], and other financial organizations which helped to keep inflation in check.\n\n===Compulsory education===\nAs part of the colonial government's overall goal of keeping the anti-Japanese movement in check, [[public education]] became an important mechanism for facilitating both control and intercultural dialogue. While secondary education institutions were restricted mostly to Japanese nationals, the impact of compulsory primary education on the Taiwanese was immense.\n\nOn July 14, 1895, [[Isawa Sh\u016bji]] was appointed as the first Education Minister, and proposed that the Colonial Government implement a policy of compulsory primary education for children (a policy that had not even been implemented in Japan at the time). The Colonial Government established the first Western-style primary school in Taipei (the modern-day Shilin Elementary School) as an experiment. Satisfied with the results, the government ordered the establishment of fourteen language schools in 1896, which were later upgraded to become public schools. During this period, schools were segregated by ethnicity. {{nihongo3|public schools|{{linktext|\u516c\u5b78\u6821}}|K\u014dgakk\u014d}} were established for Taiwanese children, while {{nihongo3|elementary schools|{{linktext|\u5c0f\u5b78\u6821}}|sh\u014dgakk\u014d}} were restricted to the children of Japanese nationals. Schools for aborigines were also established in aboriginal areas. Criteria were established for teacher selection, and several teacher training schools such as [[National Taiwan Normal University|Taihoku Normal School]] were founded. Secondary and [[post-secondary education]]al institutions, such as [[Taihoku Imperial University]] were also established, but access was restricted primarily to Japanese nationals. The emphasis for locals was placed on [[vocational education]], to help increase productivity.\n\nThe education system was finally desegregated in March 1941, when all schools (except for a few aboriginal schools) were reclassified as {{nihongo3|National schools|\u570b\u6c11\u5b78\u6821|[[kokumin gakk\u014d]]}}, open to all students regardless of ethnicity. Education was compulsory for children between the ages of eight and fourteen. Subjects taught included {{nihongo4|Morals|\u4fee\u8eab|sh\u016bshin}}, {{nihongo4|Composition|\u4f5c\u6587|sakubun}}, {{nihongo4|Reading|\u8b80\u66f8|dokusho}}, {{nihongo4|Writing|\u7fd2\u5b57|sh\u016bji}}, {{nihongo4|Mathematics|\u7b97\u8853|sanjutsu}}, {{nihongo4|Singing|\u5531\u6b4c|sh\u014dka}}, and {{nihongo4|Physical Education|\u9ad4\u64cd|tais\u014d}}.\n\nBy 1944, there were 944 primary schools in Taiwan with total enrollment rates of 71.3% for Taiwanese children, 86.4% for aboriginal children, and 99.6% for Japanese children in Taiwan. As a result, primary school enrollment rates in Taiwan were among the highest in Asia, second only to Japan itself.<ref name=gio7 />\n\n===Population===\nAs part of the emphasis placed on governmental control, the Colonial Government performed detailed censuses of Taiwan every five years starting in 1905. Statistics showed a population growth rate of 0.988 to 2.835% per year throughout Japanese rule. In 1905, the population of Taiwan was roughly 3 million.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Takekoshi |first1=Yosabur\u014d |authorlink=Takekoshi Yosabur\u014d |title=Japanese rule in Formosa |date=1907 |publisher = Longmans, Green, and co. |publication-place = London, New York, Bombay and Calcutta |ol=6986981M |oclc=753129 |chapter=Chapter XIII: Population and future development of the island resources |chapterurl=https://archive.org/stream/japaneseruleinf01takegoog#page/n230/mode/1up |ref=harv}}</ref> By 1940 the population had grown to 5.87&nbsp;million, and by the end of [[World War II]] in 1946 it numbered 6.09&nbsp;million.\n\n==Transportation developments==\n[[File:The grand sight of Taichu Station.jpg|thumb|Taich\u016b Station (now \"Former [[Taichung TRA station|Taichung Station]]\"), constructed in 1917]]\n\nThe Office of the Governor-General also placed a strong emphasis on modernization of Taiwan's transportation systems, especially railways, and to a lesser extent, highways. As a result, reliable transit links were established between the northern and southern ends of the island, supporting the increasing population.\n\n===Railways===\n{{See also|Rail transport in Taiwan}}\n\nAfter Taiwan was ceded to Japan, the [[Taiwanese push car railways|push car railways]] were introduced in Taiwan. The push car railways were in general service from 1895 to the late 1940s.\n\nThe Railway Ministry (predecessor of the modern [[Taiwan Railway Administration]]) was established on November 8, 1899, beginning a period of rapid expansion of the island's rail network. Perhaps the greatest achievement of this era was the completion of the [[Western Line, Taiwan|Western Line]], linking the major cities along the western corridor in 1908, reducing the travel time between northern and southern Taiwan from several days to a single day.\n\n[[File:Railway Ministry Building, Taiwan.jpg|thumb|The Railway Ministry building]]\n\nAlso constructed during this time were the {{nihongo4|Tansui Line|\u6de1\u6c34\u7dda||modern-day [[Tamsui Line (TRTS)|Tamsui Line]], [[Taipei Metro]]}}, {{nihongo4|Giran Line|\u5b9c\u862d\u7dda||[[Yilan Line]]}}, {{nihongo4|Heit\u014d Line|\u5c4f\u6771\u7dda||[[Pingtung Line]]}}, and {{nihongo4|T\u014dk\u014d Line|\u6771\u6e2f\u7dda||[[Donggang Line]]}}. Several private rail lines were also incorporated into the state owned system. Industrial lines such as the [[Alishan Forest Railway]] were also built. Plans were also drawn up for the [[North-Link Line]], [[South-Link Line]], as well as a line running through the mountains of central Taiwan, but were never realized due to technical difficulties as well as the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Private railways such as the [[Taiwan Sugar Railways]] (built to support the [[sugarcane]] industry), were also built.\n\nLike many other government offices, the Railway Ministry was headed by [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrats]]. Many of the railways constructed during Japanese rule continue to be used today.\n\n===Highways===\nCompared to the rapid development of the rail system, the highway system saw much less attention. However, faced with increasing competition from motorcars, the Railway Ministry began purchasing and confiscating roads running parallel to railways.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}\n\nBus service was available in urban areas, but since the cities in Taiwan were quite small at the time, they remained secondary to rail service. Most bus routes of the time centered on local [[railway stations]].\n\n==Social policy==\n[[File:Pu-Zi-Temple-Beitou-Taipei-.jpg|thumb|The Old Puji Temple (\u666e\u6fdf\u5bfa) in Beitou, Taipei, constructed during Japanese rule]]\n\nWhile the idea of \"special governance\" promoted by Got\u014d dominated most policy decisions made by the colonial authorities, the ultimate goal remained modernization. Under these ideals, the colonial government, along with community groups, would gradually push to modernize Taiwanese society. The main thrust of these efforts targeted what were known as the \"Three Bad Habits\".\n\n===\"Three Vices\"===\nThe \"Three Vices\" ({{lang|zh-hant|\u4e09\u5927\u964b\u7fd2}}) considered by the Office of the Governor-General to be archaic and unhealthy were the use of [[opium]], [[foot binding]], and the wearing of [[Queue (hairstyle)|queues]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Wu |first=Wen-shing (\u5433\u6587\u661f) |title=\u8fd1\u4ee3\u53f0\u7063\u7684\u793e\u6703\u8b8a\u9077 |trans-title=Recent Changes in Taiwanese Society}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Wu |first=Mi-cha |title=\u53f0\u7063\u53f2\u5c0f\u4e8b\u5178 |trans-title=A Brief Timeline of Major Incidents in Taiwanese History |publisher=\u9060\u6d41\u51fa\u7248 |date=2000 |isbn=9789573241614}}</ref>  Much like mainland China in the late nineteenth century, opium addiction was a serious social problem in Taiwan, with some statistics suggesting that over half of the ethnic Chinese population of Taiwan were users of the drug.  The intentional disfigurement of female feet through binding was common to mainland Chinese and Taiwanese society at the time, and the queue hairstyle worn by the male population was forced upon [[Han Chinese]] by the [[Manchu]] rulers of the Qing dynasty ([[Queue (hairstyle)#Queue Order|Queue Order]]).\n\n====Opium====\nShortly after acquiring Taiwan in 1895, then Prime Minister [[It\u014d Hirobumi]] ordered that opium should be banned in Taiwan as soon as possible. However, due to the pervasiveness of opium addiction in Taiwanese society at the time, and the social and economic problems caused by complete prohibition, the initial hard line policy was relaxed in a few years. On January 21, 1897, the Colonial Government issued the Taiwan Opium Edict mandating a government monopoly of the opium trade, and restricting the sale of opium to those with government issued permits, with the ultimate goal of total abolition. The number of opium addicts in Taiwan quickly dropped from millions to 169,064 in 1900 (6.3% of the total population at the time), to 45,832 (1.3% of the population) by 1921. However, the numbers were still higher than those in nations where opium was completely prohibited. It was generally believed that one important factor behind the Colonial Government's reluctance to completely ban opium was the potential profit to be made through a state run [[narcotics]] monopoly.\n\nIn 1921, the [[Taiwanese People's Party]] accused colonial authorities before the [[League of Nations]] of being complacent in the addiction of over 40,000 people, while making a profit off opium sales. To avoid controversy, the Colonial Government issued the New Taiwan Opium Edict on December 28, and related details of the new policy on January 8 of the following year. Under the new laws, the number of opium permits issued was decreased, a [[drug rehab|rehabilitation clinic]] was opened in Taihoku, and a concerted anti-drug campaign launched.<ref>Government figures show 2,000 opium permits issued in 1945.</ref> Despite the directive, the government remained involved with the opium trade until June 1945.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Han Cheung|title=Taiwan in Time: The \u2018war\u2019 on opium|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2017/01/15/2003663122|accessdate=15 January 2017|work=Taipei Times|date=15 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Foot binding====\n[[Foot binding]] was a practice fashionable in [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty]] China. Young girls' feet, usually at age six but often earlier, were wrapped in tight bandages so they could not grow normally, would break and become deformed as they reached adulthood. The feet would remain small and dysfunctional, prone to infection, [[paralysis]], and muscular [[atrophy]]. While such feet were considered by some to be beautiful, others considered the practice to be archaic and barbaric. In concert with community leaders, the Colonial Government launched an anti-foot binding campaign in 1901. The practice was formally banned in 1915, with violators subject to heavy punishment. Foot binding in Taiwan died out quickly afterwards.\n\n====Queue====\nThe Colonial Government took comparatively less action on [[Queue (hairstyle)|queues]]. While social campaigns against wearing queues were launched, no edicts or laws were issued on the subject. With the fall of the [[Qing dynasty]] in 1911, the popularity of queues also decreased.\n\n===Urban planning===\nThe Colonial Government initially focused on pressing needs such as [[sanitation]] and military fortifications. Plans for [[urban development]] began to be issued in 1899, calling for a five-year development plan for most medium and large sized cities. The first phase of urban redevelopment focused on the construction and improvement of roads. In Taihoku (Taipei), the old [[city walls]] were demolished, and the new {{nihongo3||\u897f\u9580\u753a|Seimonch\u014d|modern-day [[Ximending]]}} area was developed for new Japanese immigrants.\n\nThe second phase of urban development began in 1901, focusing on the areas around the South and East Gates of Taihoku and the areas around the railway station in Taich\u016b (Taichung). Primary targets for improvement included roads and [[storm drain|drainage systems]], in preparation for the arrival of more Japanese immigrants.\n\nAnother phase began in August 1905 and also included Tainan. By 1917, urban redevelopment programs were in progress in over seventy cities and towns throughout Taiwan. Many of the urban plans laid out during these programs continue to be used in Taiwan today.\n\n===Public health===\nIn the early years of Japanese rule, the Colonial Government ordered the construction of public [[clinics]] throughout Taiwan and brought in doctors from Japan to halt the spread of [[infectious disease]]. The drive was successful in eliminating diseases such as [[malaria]], [[Bubonic plague|plague]], and [[tuberculosis]] from the island. The [[public health]] system throughout the years of Japanese rule was dominated primarily by small local clinics rather than large central hospitals, a situation which would remain constant in Taiwan until the 1980s.\n\nThe Colonial Government also expended a great deal of effort in developing an effective [[Sanitation|sanitation system]] for Taiwan. British experts were hired to design storm drains and [[sewage system]]s. The expansion of streets and sidewalks, as well as building codes calling for windows allowing for air flow, mandatory neighborhood cleanups, and [[quarantine]] of the ill also helped to improve public health.\n\nPublic health education also became important in schools as well as in law enforcement. The [[Taihoku Imperial University]] also established a Tropical Medicine Research Center, and formal training for [[nurses]].\n\n===Aborigines===\n{{See also|Taiwanese aborigines}}\n\nAccording to the 1905 census, the [[Taiwanese aborigines|aboriginal]] population included 45,000+ plains aborigines{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} who were almost completely assimilated into [[Han Chinese]] society, and 113,000+ mountain aborigines.<ref>{{cite web| title=\u53f0\u6e7e\u7dcf\u7763\u5e9c\u7d71\u8a08\u66f8. \u7b2c15\uff08\u660e\u6cbb44\u5e74\uff09|trans-title= Governor-General of Taiwan Statistic Yearbook 1911|publisher= Governor-General of Taiwan |year=1913 |url=http://kindai.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/974276|page=36}}</ref> Japanese aboriginal policy focused primarily on the unassimilated latter group, known in Japanese as {{nihongo||\u9ad8\u7802\u65cf|Takasago-zoku}}.\n\nThe aborigines were subject to modified versions of [[criminal law|criminal]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]]. As with the rest of the Taiwanese population, the ultimate goal of the Colonial Government was to assimilate the aborigines into Japanese society through a dual policy of suppression and education. This Japanese policy proved its worth during World War II, when aborigines called to service proved to be the most daring soldiers the empire had ever produced. Their legendary bravery is celebrated by Japanese veterans even today.  Many of them would say they owe their survival to the {{nihongo|||Takasago Hei|[[Takasago Volunteers]]}}.\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Ogon jinja.JPG|thumb|The modern remains of {{nihongo3|[[\u014cgon Shrine]]|\u9ec3\u91d1\u795e\u793e}}, a [[Shinto shrine]] located in [[Jinguashi]], [[New Taipei]]]]\n\nThroughout most of Japanese colonial rule, the Colonial Government chose to promote the existing [[Buddhist]] religion over [[Shintoism]] in Taiwan. It was believed that used properly, religion could accelerate the assimilation of the Taiwanese into Japanese society.\n\nUnder these circumstances, existing [[Buddhist temple]]s in Taiwan were expanded and modified to accommodate Japanese elements of the religion, such as worship of [[Ksitigarbha]] (popular in Japan but not Taiwan at the time). The Japanese also constructed several new Buddhist temples throughout Taiwan, many of which also ended up combining aspects of [[Daoism]] and [[Confucianism]], a mix which still persists in Taiwan today.\n\nIn 1937 with the beginning of the K\u014dminka movement, the government began the promotion of [[Shintoism]] and the limited restriction of other religions.\n\n===Military service===\n{{See also|Taiwanese Imperial Japan Serviceman}}\n\nFor most of the Japanese colonial period, the Taiwanese were banned from service in the military of Imperial Japan.  However, starting in 1937, Taiwanese were permitted to enlist, for support duties.  In 1942 the Imperial Army's and in 1943 the Imperial Navy's respective: ''Special Volunteers Acts'' allowed Taiwanese to volunteer for those services' combat arms.  In 1944 and 1945 respectively those programs were replaced in Taiwan with systematic conscription.  207,183 Taiwanese served in the military of Imperial Japan.  In addition, thousands of aboriginal men volunteered from 1937 onwards, eventually being taken out of support and placed in [[Takasago Volunteers|special commando type units]] due to their skills in jungle warfare.\n\nThe Japanese used Aboriginal and Han Taiwanese women as \"[[comfort women]]\" who served as sex slaves to Japanese troops, along with women from other countries under Japanese colonialism such as Korea and the Philippines.<ref name=\"LoganReeves2008\">{{cite book|author1=William Logan|author2=Keir Reeves|title=Places of Pain and Shame: Dealing with 'Difficult Heritage'|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zX58AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA124&dq=truku&hl=en&sa=X&ei=P0QfVbq1MomWsAXRt4SADA&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=truku&f=false|date=5 December 2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-05149-6|pages=124\u2013}}</ref>\n\nA total of 30,304 servicemen, or 15 percent of those recruited and conscripted from Taiwan, were killed or presumed killed in action. 2nd Lt. [[Lee Teng-hui]] of the Imperial Japanese Army later went on to become the [[Republic of China]]'s president. His elder brother, Lee Teng-Chin, was killed in the Philippines and is enshrined in death along with at least 26,000 other Taiwanese Imperial Japan servicemen and hundreds of [[Takasago Volunteers]], killed or presumed killed in action, in the [[Yasukuni Shrine]] in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]], where everyone who died fighting for modern Japan is honored.\n\n==Culture==\nAfter 1915, [[armed resistance]] against the Japanese colonial government nearly ceased. Instead, spontaneous [[social movements]] became popular. The Taiwanese people organized various modern political, cultural and social clubs, adopting political consciousness with clear intentions to unite people with sympathetic sensibilities. This motivated them to strive for the common targets set up by the social movements. These movements also encouraged improvements in social culture.\n\nBesides Taiwanese literature, which connected with the social movements of the time, the aspect of Western culture which Taiwan most successfully adopted was the [[arts]]. Many famous works of art came out during this time.\n\nPopular culture led by movies, [[popular music]] and puppet theater prevailed for the first time in Taiwan during this period.\n\n===Literature===\n[[File:Loa Ho 1919-20 E-mng.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Loa Ho]], father of the new literature in Taiwan]]\n\nThe period of the second half of the colonial period, 1895 to 1945, is highly remarked as political stability and economic growth which accelerated modernization in Taiwan. The competition between the Japanese colonial Government-General and the native Taiwanese elite in the course of its modernization drew many young Taiwanese dream of being artists in a way of provoking improvement of their social status or cultivation of new knowledge which is more suitable to a modern society. Therefore, due to the trend of the campaign for modernization in Taiwan, many young native Taiwanese students went to study abroad, mostly in Japan from the late 1910s and some went to Paris in the 1930s. And indeed they became the pioneers in the era of the flourish cultural movement in Taiwan. It is irrefutable that literature had extraordinary importance in a socio-political and cultural context in the period from the 1920s to around the 1930s with the growing stimulation between writers and painters through shared interest in learning about modernization.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Clark |first1=John |title=Modernity in Asian Art |date=1993 |publisher=Wild Peony |location=Broadway, NSW |isbn=9780646147734}}</ref> The group of artists, painters including some major artists Chen Qingfen, Yang Shilong, Yang Sanlang and [[Liu Chi-hsiang]], are characterized by westernized artistic expression and their own interpretation of time and place which represents a modern political and as well as cultural movement that were emerged by the landed-gentry who strongly resist against the Japanese colonial governors. One of the Japanese art critics recounts that the steady economic growth and great increase of public interest in art with numerous art exhibitions by single and group artists had attracted both Taiwanese and Taiwan-born Japanese artists return to Taiwan and share their works with audiences.<ref>J. Clark \"Taiwanese Painting Under the Japanese Occupation\", Journal of Oriental Studies, Vol. 25, No.1 (1987)</ref>\n\nTaiwanese students studying in Tokyo firstly restructured [[Enlightenment Society]] in 1918, later renamed the [[New People Society]] after 1920, and this was the manifestation for various upcoming political and social movements in Taiwan. Many new publications, such as \"Taiwanese Literature & Art\" (1934) and \"New Taiwanese Literature\" (1935), started shortly thereafter. These led to the onset of the vernacular movement in the society at large as the modern literary broke away from the classical forms of ancient poetry. In 1915, this group of people, led by [[Lin Hsien-tang]] made an initial and large financial contribution on establishing the [[Taichung Municipal Taichung First Senior High School|first middle school in Taichung]] for the aboriginals and Taiwanese<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lin|first1=Hsien-tang |date=1927 |script-title=zh:\u6797\u737b\u5802\u5148\u751f\u7d00\u5ff5\u96c6|language=Chinese |volume=1 |pages=17\u201322}}; {{cite book |last=Tai |first=Pao-tsun |year=1987 |script-title=zh:\u58eb\u7d33\u578b\u653f\u6cbb\u904b\u52d5\u9818\u5c0e\u8005\u2014\u6797\u737b\u5802 |language=zh |series=\u81fa\u7063\u8fd1\u4ee3\u540d\u4eba\u8a8c |volume=4 |pages=41\u201373 |oclc=18086252}}</ref> and furthermore, they actively engaged to proclaim modernization, the cultural enlightenment and welfare of the island. They were passionate in delivering their political perspective in all sorts of forum covering lectures, seminars, concerts and plays for the population, maybe focusing on enthusiastic younger art students, being held in each season in almost every year. But shortly after, the oversea students returned to the island and they vigorously started to spread the ideas of socialist and proletarian, hence the working class necessitated changes social conditions. In the book of Wenhua xiehui de chengi yu fenlie, Zhang states that in early 1927, the association was broken up and eventually taken over by aggressive proletarian fractions. Many scholars acknowledged possible connections of this movement with the [[May Fourth Movement]] in China.\n\nLiterature movements did not disappear even when they were under censorship by the colonial government-general. In the early 1930s, a famous debate on Taiwanese rural language unfolded formally. This event had numerous lasting effects on Taiwanese literature, language and racial consciousness. In 1930, Taiwanese-Japanese resident [[Huang Shihui]] started the debate on rural literature in Tokyo. He advocated that Taiwanese literature should be about Taiwan, have impact on a wide audience, and use [[Taiwanese Hokkien]]. In 1931, [[Koeh Chhiu-seng]], a resident of Taihoku (Taipei), prominently supported Huang's viewpoint. Koeh started the Taiwanese Rural Language Debate, which advocated literature published in Taiwanese. This was immediately supported by [[Loa Ho]] who is considered as the father of Taiwanese literature. After this, dispute as to whether the literature of Taiwan should use Taiwanese or [[Written vernacular Chinese|Chinese]], and whether the subject matter should concern Taiwan, became the focus of the New Taiwan Literature Movement. However, because of the upcoming war and the pervasive Japanese cultural education, these debates could not develop any further. They finally lost traction under the Japanization policy set by the government.<ref name = pol_movement>\n* {{cite book |last1=Lee |first1=Jim |script-title=zh:\u53f0\u7063\u2500\u6211\u7684\u9078\u64c7 |date=1995 |publisher=\u7389\u5c71\u793e |location=Taipei |isbn=9789579361071 |trans-chapter=National recognition of Taiwanese political movements in the past hundred years |chapter=\u4e00\u767e\u5e74\u4f86\u81fa\u7063\u653f\u6cbb\u904b\u52d5\u4e2d\u7684\u570b\u5bb6\u8a8d\u540c |language=Chinese |pages=73\u2013145}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Zhang |first1=De-shui |script-title=zh:\u6fc0\u52d5!\u81fa\u7063\u7684\u6b77\u53f2 : \u81fa\u7063\u4eba\u7684\u81ea\u570b\u8a8d\u8b58 |date=1992 |publisher=\u524d\u885b |location=Taipei |isbn=9789579512756 |language=Chinese |trans-title=Excitement!

This literature and art movement was political in its implications. Also many historians highlights developments in modern drama and literature with the intimate integration between the art worlds of Tokyo and Taipei in the 1930s. From 1935 literacy writers and visual artists began to closely stimulate each other and looked to society for support. Mostly the novels were renowned for its distinct nationalist and social realistic expression whilst painting haven't produced works that merely decorators of the colonial period.\n\nAfter the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] in 1937, the government of Taiwan immediately instituted \"National Spirit General Mobilization\", which formally commenced the Japanization policy.\n\nTaiwanese writers could then only rely on organizations dominated by Japanese writers, for example the \"Taiwanese Poet Association\" which was established in 1939, and the \"Association of Taiwanese Literature & Art\", expanded in 1940.<ref name= pol_movement /> This is because after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese war, re-introduction of military rule in 1937 terminated the development of art and cultural movement in Taiwan.\n\nThe movement of literature of modern Taiwan could be simplified by the two major trends; revitalized Chinese writing and modern literature in Japanese language.\n\nTaiwanese literature mainly focused on the Taiwanese spirit and the essence of Taiwanese culture. People in literature and the arts began to think about issues of Taiwanese culture, and attempted to establish a culture that truly belonged to Taiwan. The significant cultural movement throughout the colonial period were led by the young generation who were highly educated in formal Japanese schools. Education played such a key role in supporting the government and to a larger extent, developing economic growth of Taiwan. However, despite the government prime effort in elementary education and normal education, there was a limited number of middle schools, approximately 3 across the whole country, so the preferred choices for graduates were leaving for Tokyo or other cities to get an education. The foreign education of the young students was carried out solely by individuals' self-motivation and support from family. Education abroad got its popularity, particularly from Taichung county, with the endeavor for acquiring skills and knowledge of civilization even under the situation of neither the colonial government nor society being able to guarantee their bright future; with no job plan for these educated people after their return.<ref>{{cite book |oclc=673809296 |script-title=ja:\u53f0\u6e7e\u7dcf\u7763\u5e9c\u5b66\u4e8b\u5e74\u5831. \u7b2c\uff12\uff15\uff08\u662d\u548c\u5143\u5e74\u5ea6\uff09 |title=Taiwan s\u014dtokufu gakuji nenp\u014d |volume=25 |year=1927 |publisher=\u53f0\u6e7e\u7dcf\u7763\u5e9c\u6587\u6559\u5c40 |location=Taihoku/Taipei |language=Japanese |pages=50\u20131 |url=http://kindai.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/1447981/50}}; {{cite book |script-title=ja:\u53f0\u6e7e\u7dcf\u7763\u5e9c\u5b66\u4e8b\u5e74\u5831 |volume=28 |year=1930 |publisher=\u53f0\u6e7e\u7dcf\u7763\u5e9c\u6587\u6559\u5c40 |location=Taihoku/Taipei |language=Japanese |page=46}}</ref>\n\n===Western art===\n[[File:Chen 1927b Chiayi.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Outside of Chiayi Street/ Tan Ting-pho/ 1926/ Painting on canvas/ 64x53cm/ Selected as part of the 7th Imperial Japanese Exhibition]]\n\nDuring the [[Qing dynasty]], the concept of Western art did not exist in Taiwan. Painting was not a highly respected occupation, and even Chinese landscape painting was undeveloped. When the Japanese began their colonization of Taiwan in 1895, they brought in a new educational system which introduced Western and Japanese art education. This not only set the basis for the future development of art appreciation in Taiwan, it also produced various famous artists. Painter and instructor [[Ishikawa Kinichiro]] contributed immensely in planning the training of new art teachers. He personally instructed students and encouraged them to travel to Japan to learn the more sophisticated techniques of art.\n\nIn 1926, a Taiwanese student in Japan named [[Tan Ting-pho]] published a work titled ''Outside of Chiayi Street'' (see left). His work was selected for display in the seventh [[Imperial Japanese Exhibition]]. This was the first Western-style work by a Taiwanese artist to be included in a Japanese exhibition. Many other works were subsequently featured in the Imperial Japanese Exhibitions and other exhibitions. These successes made it easier for the arts to become widespread in Taiwan. Ironically, the Japanese-appreciated Chen was executed by the Chinese after World War II without trial for being a \"bandit\".\n\nWhat really established the arts in Taiwan was the introduction of official Japanese exhibitions in Taiwan. In 1927, the governor of Taiwan, along with artists Ishikawa Kinichiro, [[Shiotsuki Toho]] and [[Kinoshita Shizukishi]] established the [[Taiwanese Art Exhibition]].<ref>This exhibition was held ten times from 1927 to 1936. It did not occur in 1937, due to the Second Sino-Japanese War.  After 1938, the exhibition was held by the government of Taiwan, and was renamed \"Taiwan Government Art Exhibition\".</ref> This exhibition was held sixteen times from 1938 to 1945. It cultivated the first generation of Taiwanese western artists. The regional Taiwanese art style developed by the exhibition still affected various fields, e.g. art, art design, and engineering design, even after the war.\n\n===Cinema===\n[[File:\u838e\u52c7\u4e4b\u9418.jpg|200px|right|thumb|''Sayon's Bell'', a Japanese movie produced in Taiwan during this period]]\n\nFrom 1901 to 1937, [[Cinema of Taiwan|Taiwanese cinema]] was influenced immensely by [[Japanese cinema]]. Because of Taiwan's status as a Japanese colony, the traditions of Japanese movies were generally accepted by Taiwanese producers. For instance, the use of a ''[[benshi]]'' (narrator of silent films), which was a very important component of the film-going experience in Japan, was adopted and renamed ''piansu'' by the Taiwanese. This narrator was very different from its equivalent in the Western world. It rapidly evolved into a star system. In fact, people would go to see the very same film narrated by different benshi, to hear the other benshi's interpretation. A romance could become a comedy or a drama, depending on the narrator's style and skills.\n\nThe first Taiwan-made film was a documentary produced in February 1907 by [[Takamatsu Toyojiro]], with a group of photographers that traveled through various areas in Taiwan. Their production was called \"Description of Taiwan\", and it covered through subjects such as city construction, electricity, agriculture, industry, mining, railways, education, landscapes, traditions, and conquest of aborigines. The first movie drama produced by Taiwanese was called \"Whose Fault?\" in 1925, produced by the Association of Taiwanese Cinema Research. Other types of films including educational pieces, newsreels and propaganda also helped form the mainstream of local Taiwanese movie productions until the defeat of Japan in 1945. ''[[Sayon's Bell]]'', which depicted an aboriginal maid helping Japanese, was a symbolic production that represents these types of films.\n\nIn 1908, Takamatsu Toyojiro settled in Taiwan and began to construct theaters in the main cities. Takamatsu also signed with several Japanese and foreign movie companies and set up institutionalized movie publication. In 1924, theaters in Taiwan imported advanced [[intertitle]] technique from Japan, and the cinema in Taiwan grew more prominent. On October 1935, a celebration of the fortieth anniversary of annexation in Taiwan was held. The year after, Taipei and [[Fukuoka, Fukuoka|Fukuoka]] were connected by airway. These two events pushed the Taiwanese cinema into its golden age.\n\n===Popular music===\nPopular music in Taiwan was established in the 1930s. Although published [[gramophone record|records]] and [[popular songs]] already existed in Taiwan before the 1930s, the quality and popularity of most of them was very poor. This was mainly because popular songs at the time differed slightly from traditional music like [[Folk song|folk songs]] and [[Taiwanese opera]]. However, because of the rapid development of cinema and broadcasting during the 1930s, new [[popular songs]] that stepped away from traditional influences began to appear and become widespread in a short period of time.\n\nThe first accepted eminent popular song in Taiwan collocated with the [[Chinese movie]], ''[[The Peach Girl]]'' (Tao hua qi xie ji). Produced by [[Lianhua Film Company|Lianhua Productions]], ''The Peach Girl'', starring [[Ruan Lingyu]], screened in Taiwan theaters in 1932. Hoping to attract more Taiwanese viewers, the producers requested composers [[Zhan Tianma]] and [[Wang Yunfeng]] to compose a song with the same title. The song that came out was a major hit and achieved success in record sales. From this period on, Taiwanese popular music with the assistance of cinema began to rise.\n\n===Puppet theater===\n{{Main|Glove puppetry}}\n\nMany [[Hokkien]]-speaking immigrants entered Taiwan during the 1750s, and with them they brought puppet theatre. The stories were based mainly on classical books and stage dramas and were very refined. Artistry focused on the complexity of the puppet movements.  Musical accompaniment was generally [[Nanguan music|Nanguan]] and [[Beiguan music|Beiguan]] music. According to the ''Records of Taiwan Province'', Nanguan was the earliest form of puppet theatre in Taiwan. Although this kind of puppet theatre fell out of the mainstream, it can still be found in a few troupes around [[Taipei]] today.\n\n[[File:Taiwan-Puppet-Monkey-god2.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Puppet theatre, an important cultural entertainment during Japanese rule]]\n\nDuring the 1920s, [[wuxia]] puppet theatre (i.e. based on martial arts) gradually developed. The stories were the main difference between traditional and wuxia puppet theatre. Based on new, popular wuxia novels, performances focused on the display of unique martial arts by the puppets. The representative figures during this era were [[Huang Haidai]] of Wuzhouyuan and [[Zhong Renxiang]] of Xinyige. This puppet genre began its development in [[Yunlin]]'s [[Huwei]] and [[Xiluo]] towns, and was popularized in southern-central Taiwan. Huang Haidai's puppet theatre was narrated in Hokkien, and included poems, historical narrative, [[couplet]]s and riddles. Its performance blended Beiguan, Nanguan, Luantan, Zhengyin, Gezai and Chaodiao music.\n\nAfter the 1930s, the Japanization policy affected puppet theatre. The customary Chinese Beiguan was forbidden, and was replaced with Western music. The costumes and the puppets were a mixture of Japanese and Chinese style. The plays often included Japanese stories like [[Mitokomon]] and others, with the puppets dressed in Japanese clothing. Performances were presented in Japanese. These new linguistic and cultural barriers reduced public acceptance, but introduced techniques which subsequently influenced the future development of the [[Golden Light puppet theatre]], including music and stage settings.\n\nDuring this era, the world of puppet theatre in southern Taiwan had the '''Five Great Pillars''' and '''Four Great Celebrities'''. The \"Five Great Pillars\" referred to Huang Haidai, Zhong Renxiang, Huang Tianquan, Hu Jinzhu and Lu Chongyi; the \"Four Great Celebrities\" referred to Huang Tianchuan, Lu Chongyi, Li Tuyuan and Zheng Chuanming.\n\n===Baseball===\nThe Japanese also brought baseball to Taiwan. There were baseball teams in elementary schools as well as public schools, and the Japanese built baseball fields such as [[Tainan Stadium]]. It became such a widespread sport that, by the early 1930s, nearly all major secondary schools and many primary schools had established representative baseball teams. The development of the game in Taiwan culminated when a [[Kano Baseball Team|team from Kagi N\u014drin Gakk\u014d]], an agriculture and forestry high school, ranked second in Japan's \"K\u014dshien\" national high-school baseball tournament. One legacy of this era today are the careers of several professional baseball players, such as [[Chien-Ming Wang]], [[Hong-Chih Kuo]], [[Tzu-Wei Lin]], and [[Chien-Ming Chiang]].\n\n== Change of governing authority ==\n{{See also|Surrender of Japan|Political status of Taiwan}}\n\n[[File:Ando Rikichi surrender.jpg|thumb|right|[[Chen Yi (Kuomintang)|Chen Yi]] (right) accepting the receipt of Order No. 1 signed by [[Rikichi And\u014d]] (left), the last Japanese Governor-General of Taiwan, in [[Zhongshan Hall|Taipei City Hall]]]]\n\nWith the end of [[World War II]], Taiwan was placed under the administrative control of the [[Republic of China]] by the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] ([[UNRRA]]) after 50 years of colonial rule by Japan. [[Chen Yi (Kuomintang)|Chen Yi]], the ROC Chief Executive of Taiwan, arrived on October 24, 1945, and received the last Japanese Governor-General, [[And\u014d Rikichi]], who signed the document of surrender on the next day, which was proclaimed by Chen as \"[[Retrocession Day]]\". This turned out to be legally controversial since Japan did not renounce its sovereignty over Taiwan until April 28, 1952, with the coming into force of the [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]], which further complicated the [[political status of Taiwan]]. As a result, use of the term \"Retrocession of Taiwan\" ({{zh|t=\u81fa\u7063\u5149\u5fa9|p=T\u00e1iw\u0101n gu\u0101ngf\u00f9}}) is less common in modern Taiwan.\n\n===Background===\nAt the [[Cairo Conference (1943)|Cairo Conference]] of 1943, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] adopted a statement declaring that Japan will give up Taiwan at the end of the war. In April 1944, the ROC government at the wartime capital of [[Chongqing]] established the Taiwan Research Committee ({{zh|t=\u81fa\u7063\u8abf\u67e5\u59d4\u54e1\u6703|p=T\u00e1iw\u0101n di\u00e0och\u00e1 w\u011biyu\u00e1nhu\u00ec|labels=no}}) with [[Chen Yi (Kuomintang)|Chen Yi]] as chairman. Shortly afterwards, the committee reported its findings on the economy, politics, society, and military affairs of Taiwan to Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]].\n\nFollowing the war, opinion in the ROC government was split as to the administration of Taiwan. One faction supported treating Taiwan in the same way as other Chinese territories occupied by the Japanese during [[World War II]], creating a [[Taiwan Province]]. The other faction supported establishing a [[Special administrative regions of China#ROC special administrative regions|special administrative region]] in Taiwan with special military and police powers. In the end, Chiang Kai-shek chose to take Chen Yi's suggestion of creating a special 2000 man \"Office of the Chief Executive of Taiwan Province\" ({{zh |t = \u81fa\u7063\u7701\u884c\u653f\u9577\u5b98\u516c\u7f72 |p = T\u00e1iw\u0101n Sh\u011bng X\u00edngzh\u00e8ng Zh\u01cenggu\u0101n G\u014dngsh\u01d4 |labels = no }}) to handle the transfer.\n\nJapan formally [[Surrender of Japan|surrendered]] to the Allies on August 14, 1945. On August 29, Chiang Kai-shek appointed Chen Yi as Chief Executive of Taiwan Province, and announced the creation of the Office of the Chief Executive of Taiwan Province and [[Taiwan Garrison Command]] on September 1, with Chen Yi also as the commander of the latter body. After several days of preparation, an advance party moved into Taipei on October 5, with more personnel from Shanghai and Chungking arriving between October 5 and 24. By 1938 about 309,000 Japanese lived in [[Taiwan]].<ref>{{cite journal |title = Formosa (Taiwan) Under Japanese Rule |first=A.
