He worked with Professor {{ill|Aurel von Szily|de}} in [[M\u00fcnster]] during the 1930s and, with him, pioneered an electrical treatment for [[retinal detachment]].  Machemer suffered discrimination in Nazi German after his wife was deemed to be \"half-Jewish\".  He joined the German army at the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] in the hope of winning a first class [[Iron Cross]] bravery medal.  Machemer hoped this would allow his family to be reclassified as being of \"German-blood\".  He fought in France and Russia, was wounded in action and won both the first and second class Iron Cross.  Machemer was killed in action at the [[Second Battle of Kharkov]] on 18 May 1942, just four days after being notified of the first class award.  His wife and children were granted German-blood status in March 1943.  Machemer kept extensive written, photographic and film records of his wartime service and these have been published in a book and documentary film.\n\n== Early life and career  ==\nHelmut Machemer was born in 1902/03 and spent much of his early life in [[M\u00fcnster]].<ref name=spiegel/>  He received a doctorate from the [[University of M\u00fcnster]] and afterwards worked at an eye clinic in the city under Professor {{ill|Aurel von Szily|de}}, while studying medicine at the [[University of Kiel]].<ref name=spiegel/>  Machemer dated Erna from 1929 and in June 1932 became aware that she might have Jewish ancestry, which may have been an issue due to the rise of the anti-Semitic [[Nazi Party]].

Over half (46 of 75) of Toronto's subway stations are accessible. In 2014, the TTC began introducing new low-floor vehicles on its [[Toronto streetcar system|streetcar network]].

They have [[priority seat]]ing identified in blue, and flip-up benches at designated wheelchair locations in each car. The location of these can be found by an exterior accessible icon beside the door, or on the Toronto Rockets, an additional exterior blue light beside the door.\n\nThe T1 series subway cars were the first trains to have:\n* wider doorways, \n* no centre line vertical stanchion bars.\n\nAll trains offer automated audible-only station stop announcements, the [[Toronto Rocket (Toronto subway car)|Toronto Rocket]] subway cars have twice the accessible seating compared to the T1 subway cars.

In some cases, Wheel-Trans buses connect customers from their homes to accessible subway stations allowing the rider to use the conventional system for a portion of their journey. The service was created in 1975 as the challenges for people with accessibility needs became more public, and at a time where the entire surface system ran high-floor vehicles which were inaccessible, and subway stations did not have elevators.\n\n==Streetcars==\nAs a result of the [[Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2005|2005 Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act]], which requires all public transport services in Ontario to become accessible by 2025, the TTC began to make its streetcar system wheelchair accessible on August 31, 2014, when the first two new low-floor [[Flexity Outlook (Toronto streetcar)|Flexity Outlook]] streetcars entered service on the [[510 Spadina]] line. The new streetcars have also been used on the [[509 Harbourfront]] since March 29, 2015; on the [[514 Cherry]] (which operated along King street between Dufferin and Sumach streets) from June 19, 2016, until that route's decommissioning on October 7, 2018, and now operate on the main [[504 King]] line (which has been using the new streetcars since January 7, 2018 and as of October 2018, it operates in two branches, the 504A which operates between Dundas West station and the Distillery loop and the 504B which operates between Dufferin-Exhibition gate loop and Broadview station); they have also been in operation on the [[512 St. Clair]] since September 3, 2017, on [[501 Queen]] since January 6, 2019 on [[508 Lake Shore]] since September 3, 2019, [[506 Carlton]] on October 13, 2019, and [[505 Dundas]] on April 20, 2020.<ref> [http://www.ttc.ca/Service_Advisories/Service_changes/505-511_Service_Changes.jsp] 505 Dundas and 511 Bathurst service changes\nEffective April 20, 2020 www.ttc.ca, published April 16, 2020 </ref>\n\nWith the retirement of the last high-floor [[Canadian Light Rail Vehicle]] (CLRV) streetcars on December 29, 2019, the entire TTC streetcar fleet consisted of accessible Flexity Outlook vehicles.<ref name=\"byeCLRV\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ttc.ca/News/2019/November/21_11_19nr_CLRV_contest.jsp|title=TTC's legacy CLRV streetcars reach the end of the line on Dec 29|last=|first=|date=November 21, 2019|website=TTC|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191122222413/https://www.ttc.ca/News/2019/November/21_11_19nr_CLRV_contest.jsp|archive-date=November 22, 2019|access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref>\n\nFormer TTC manager David Gunn criticized the new streetcar order: \"[T]hey're not accessible.

Most of the [[Toronto subway]] system was built before [[wheelchair]] access was a requirement under the [[Ontarians with Disabilities Act]] (ODA). However, all subway stations built since 1996 are equipped with elevators, and elevators have been installed in 30 stations built before 1996, including 1 station that was expanded in 2002, {{ttcs|Sheppard\u2013Yonge}}). Over half (46 of 75) of Toronto's subway stations are accessible. In 2014, the TTC began introducing new low-floor vehicles on its [[Toronto streetcar system|streetcar network]]. These accessible vehicles ultimately replaced the ageing, non-accessible [[Canadian Light Rail Vehicle|Canadian and Articulated Light Rail Vehicle]] streetcars by December 29, 2019.<ref name=\"byeCLRV\" /> In December 2015, the TTC retired the last of its lift-equipped high-floor buses, which were introduced in 1996, making all 170 bus routes 100% low-floor accessible.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web |url=https://ttc.ca/News/2015/December/1203-last_orion.jsp |title=TTC All 170 TTC bus routes now 100% low-floor accessible |publisher=Toronto Transit Commission |date=December 5, 2015 |accessdate=December 4, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Subway==\n===Vehicles===\n[[Image:TTC ACTIVE ROUTE MAP SAMPLE.jpg|right|thumb|Sample active route map on display with the interior mockup of the new Toronto Rocket subway car]]\nAll subway cars, the [[T-series (Toronto subway car)|T1]], and [[Toronto Rocket]], offer level boarding for customers with wheelchairs and other accessibility needs. They have [[priority seat]]ing identified in blue, and flip-up benches at designated wheelchair locations in each car. The location of these can be found by an exterior accessible icon beside the door, or on the Toronto Rockets, an additional exterior blue light beside the door.\n\nThe T1 series subway cars were the first trains to have:\n* wider doorways, \n* no centre line vertical stanchion bars.\n\nAll trains offer automated audible-only station stop announcements, the [[Toronto Rocket (Toronto subway car)|Toronto Rocket]] subway cars have twice the accessible seating compared to the T1 subway cars. The Toronto Rockets have visual displays (showing the next stop along with arrows pointing to which side doors will open on at the next stop) and electronic route maps to assist customers who are hearing-impaired and also verbally announce the side doors will open on at the next stop.\n\n===Stations===\nAccessible stations are equipped with elevators, wide fare gates, and accessible doors.

In some cases, Wheel-Trans buses connect customers from their homes to accessible subway stations allowing the rider to use the conventional system for a portion of their journey. The service was created in 1975 as the challenges for people with accessibility needs became more public, and at a time where the entire surface system ran high-floor vehicles which were inaccessible, and subway stations did not have elevators.\n\n==Streetcars==\nAs a result of the [[Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2005|2005 Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act]], which requires all public transport services in Ontario to become accessible by 2025, the TTC began to make its streetcar system wheelchair accessible on August 31, 2014, when the first two new low-floor [[Flexity Outlook (Toronto streetcar)|Flexity Outlook]] streetcars entered service on the [[510 Spadina]] line. The new streetcars have also been used on the [[509 Harbourfront]] since March 29, 2015; on the [[514 Cherry]] (which operated along King street between Dufferin and Sumach streets) from June 19, 2016, until that route's decommissioning on October 7, 2018, and now operate on the main [[504 King]] line (which has been using the new streetcars since January 7, 2018 and as of October 2018, it operates in two branches, the 504A which operates between Dundas West station and the Distillery loop and the 504B which operates between Dufferin-Exhibition gate loop and Broadview station); they have also been in operation on the [[512 St. Clair]] since September 3, 2017, on [[501 Queen]] since January 6, 2019 on [[508 Lake Shore]] since September 3, 2019, [[506 Carlton]] on October 13, 2019, and [[505 Dundas]] on April 20, 2020.<ref> [http://www.ttc.ca/Service_Advisories/Service_changes/505-511_Service_Changes.jsp] 505 Dundas and 511 Bathurst service changes\nEffective April 20, 2020 www.ttc.ca, published April 16, 2020 </ref>\n\nWith the retirement of the last high-floor [[Canadian Light Rail Vehicle]] (CLRV) streetcars on December 29, 2019, the entire TTC streetcar fleet consisted of accessible Flexity Outlook vehicles.<ref name=\"byeCLRV\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ttc.ca/News/2019/November/21_11_19nr_CLRV_contest.jsp|title=TTC's legacy CLRV streetcars reach the end of the line on Dec 29|last=|first=|date=November 21, 2019|website=TTC|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191122222413/https://www.ttc.ca/News/2019/November/21_11_19nr_CLRV_contest.jsp|archive-date=November 22, 2019|access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref>\n\nFormer TTC manager David Gunn criticized the new streetcar order: \"[T]hey're not accessible.
