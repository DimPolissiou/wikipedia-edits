[[Software]] for wardriving is freely available on the [[internet]].\n\n'''Warbiking''', '''warcycling''', '''warwalking''' and similar use the same approach but with other modes of transportation.\n\n== Etymology ==\n''War driving'' originated from [[wardialing]], a method popularized by a character played by [[Matthew Broderick]] in the film ''[[WarGames]]'', and named after that film. War dialing consists of dialing every phone number in a specific sequence in search of modems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spamlaws.com/war-driving-attack.html|title=War Driving Attack}}</ref>\n\n==Variants==\n''Warbiking'' or ''warcycling'' is similar to wardriving, but is done from a moving [[bicycle]] or [[motorcycle]]. This practice is sometimes facilitated by mounting a Wi-Fi enabled device on the vehicle.\n\n''Warwalking'', or ''warjogging'', is similar to wardriving, but is done on foot rather than from a moving vehicle. The disadvantages of this method are slower speed of travel (but leading to discovery of more infrequently discovered networks) and the absence of a convenient computing environment. Consequently, handheld devices such as [[pocket computer]]s, which can perform such tasks while users are walking or standing, have dominated this practice. Technology advances and developments in the early 2000s expanded the extent of this practice. Advances include computers with integrated Wi-Fi, rather than [[CompactFlash]] (CF) or [[PC Card]] (PCMCIA) add-in cards in computers such as [[Dell Axim]], Compaq [[iPAQ]] and [[Toshiba]] pocket computers starting in 2002. More recently, the active [[Nintendo DS]] and [[PlayStation Portable|Sony PSP]] enthusiast communities gained Wi-Fi abilities on these devices. Further, many newer [[smartphone]]s integrate Wi-Fi and [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS).\n\n''Warrailing'', or ''Wartraining'', is similar to wardriving, but is done on a train or tram rather than from a slower more controllable vehicle. The disadvantages of this method are higher speed of travel (resulting in less discovery of more infrequently discovered networks) and often limited to major roads with a higher traffic.\n\n''Warkitting'' is a combination of wardriving and [[rootkit]]ting.<ref>{{cite web\n| last = Tsow\n| first = Alex\n| title = Warkitting: the Drive-by Subversion of Wireless Home Routers\n| url = http://www.indiana.edu/~phishing/papers/warkit.pdf\n}}</ref> In a warkitting attack, a hacker replaces the firmware of an attacked router.

This can be likened to listening to a radio station that happens to be broadcasting in the area or with other forms of [[DXing]].\n\nWith other types of software, such as [[NetStumbler]], the wardriver actively sends probe messages, and the access point responds per design. The legality of active wardriving is less certain, since the wardriver temporarily becomes \"associated\" with the network, even though no data is transferred. Most access points, when using default \"out of the box\" security settings, are intended to provide wireless access to all who request it. The war driver's liability may be reduced by setting the computer to a static IP, instead of using [[DHCP]], preventing the network from granting the computer an IP address or logging the connection.<ref>{{cite web\n |author       = Wei-Meng Lee\n |title        = Wireless Surveying on the Pocket PC\n |work         = O'Reilly Network\n |accessdate   = 1 September 2007\n |date         = 27 May 2004\n |url          = http://www.oreillynet.com/lpt/a/4876\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090619182138/http://www.oreillynet.com/lpt/a/4876\n |archive-date = 19 June 2009\n |url-status     = dead}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, the case that is usually referenced in determining whether a network has been \"accessed\" is ''[[State v.
