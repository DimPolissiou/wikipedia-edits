Although better known for his children's books and illustrations for Mark Twain and Lewis Carroll, he published two books of [[reversible figure|reversible illustrations]], in which the picture turns into a different image entirely when flipped upside down. The last page in his book ''Topsys & Turvys'' contains the phrase THE END, which, when inverted, reads PUZZLE. In ''Topsys & Turvys Number 2'' (1902), Newell ended with a variation on the ambigram in which THE END changes into PUZZLE 2.\n\nIn March 1904 [[Gustave Verbeek]] used ambigrams{{which|date=April 2020}} in three consecutive strips of \"The UpsideDowns of old man Muffaroo and little lady Lovekins\".{{dubious|date=April 2020}} {{citation needed|date=February 2020}} The format of that strip otherwise prevented the use of word balloons.{{explain|date=April 2020}} His comics were [[ambiguous image|ambiguous images]], made in such a way that one could read the 6 panel comic, flip the book and keep reading.   \n\nFrom June to September 1908, the British monthly ''The Strand'' published a series of ambigrams by different people in its \"Curiosities\" column.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite magazine|last=Newnes|first=George|date=1908|title=Curiosities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=45MkAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA359&lpg=PA359&dq=Possibly+B+is+the+only+letter+of+the+alphabet+that+will+produce+such+an+interesting+anomaly&source=bl&ots=ScGLkirrWp&sig=DY-p5rSxj-fKc1MoJv7_sruTSws&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjXm8vdxJXQAhVGyyYKHbjiCKMQ6AEIIzAB|magazine=The Strand Magazine|issue=36|page=359|doi=|pmid=|access-date=6 November 2016}}</ref> Of particular interest is the fact that all four of the people submitting ambigrams believed them to be a rare property of particular words.

Some ambigrams feature a relationship between their [[Visual appearance|form]] and their content. Ambigrams usually fall into one of several categories:\n\n; 3-Dimensional : A design where an object is presented that will appear to read several letters or words when viewed from different angles. Such designs can be generated using [[constructive solid geometry]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n; Chain :A design where a word (or sometimes words) are interlinked, forming a repeating chain. Letters are usually overlapped meaning that a word will start partway through another word.

For example, the words \"dollop\", \"suns\" and \"pod\" form natural rotational ambigrams. In Korean,  \uacf0 (bear) and \ubb38 (door) form a natural rotational ambigram. In some fonts, the word \"swims\" forms a natural rotational ambigram.

See the article ''[[transformation of text]]'' for a discussion of letter symmetry.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n;Perceptual Shift (Oscillation) :A design with no symmetry but can be read as two different words depending on how the curves of the letters are interpreted.<ref name=\"John Langdon\"/>\n\n; Rotational : A design that presents several instances of words when rotated through a fixed angle.  This is usually 180 degrees, but rotational ambigrams of other angles exist, for example 90 or 45 degrees.  The word spelled out from the alternative direction(s) is often the same, but may be a different word to the initially presented form.  A simple example is the lower-case abbreviation for \"Down\", ''dn'', which looks like the lower-case word ''up'' when rotated 180 degrees.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n; [[Strobogrammatic number|Strobogrammatic]]: A natural rotational ambigram consisting of numerical digits.\n\n; Space-Filling : Similar to chain ambigrams, but tile to fill the 2-dimensional plane.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n; Spinonym : An ambigram in which all the letters are made of the same glyph, possibly rotated and/or inverted.

Rather than going left-to-right as in modern European languages, or right-to-left as in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], \nalternate lines in boustrophedon must be read in opposite directions. Also, the individual characters are reversed, or mirrored. It was a common way of writing in stone in [[Ancient Greece]].\n\nMirror writing in [[Islamic calligraphy]] flourished during the early modern period, but its origins may stretch as far back as pre-Islamic mirror-image rock inscriptions in the [[Hejaz]]. \n\nThe earliest known non-natural [[Point reflection|rotational]] ambigram dates to [[1893]] by artist [[Peter Newell]]. Although better known for his children's books and illustrations for Mark Twain and Lewis Carroll, he published two books of reversible illustrations, in which the picture turns into a different image entirely when flipped upside down. The last page in his book ''Topsys & Turvys'' contains the phrase THE END, which, when inverted, reads PUZZLE. In ''Topsys & Turvys Number 2'' (1902), Newell ended with a variation on the ambigram in which THE END changes into PUZZLE 2.\n\nIn March 1904 [[Gustave Verbeek]] used ambigrams{{which|date=April 2020}} in three consecutive strips of \"The UpsideDowns of old man Muffaroo and little lady Lovekins\".{{dubious|date=April 2020}} {{citation needed|date=February 2020}} The format of that strip otherwise prevented the use of word balloons.{{explain|date=April 2020}} His comics were [[ambiguous image|ambiguous images]], made in such a way that one could read the 6 panel comic, flip the book and keep reading.   \n\nFrom June to September 1908, the British monthly ''The Strand'' published a series of ambigrams by different people in its \"Curiosities\" column.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite magazine|last=Newnes|first=George|date=1908|title=Curiosities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=45MkAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA359&lpg=PA359&dq=Possibly+B+is+the+only+letter+of+the+alphabet+that+will+produce+such+an+interesting+anomaly&source=bl&ots=ScGLkirrWp&sig=DY-p5rSxj-fKc1MoJv7_sruTSws&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjXm8vdxJXQAhVGyyYKHbjiCKMQ6AEIIzAB|magazine=The Strand Magazine|issue=36|page=359|doi=|pmid=|access-date=6 November 2016}}</ref> Of particular interest is the fact that all four of the people submitting ambigrams believed them to be a rare property of particular words.

Some ambigrams feature a relationship between their [[Visual appearance|form]] and their content. Ambigrams usually fall into one of several categories:\n\n; 3-Dimensional : A design where an object is presented that will appear to read several letters or words when viewed from different angles. Such designs can be generated using [[constructive solid geometry]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n; Chain :A design where a word (or sometimes words) are interlinked, forming a repeating chain. Letters are usually overlapped meaning that a word will start partway through another word.

Ambigrams that form different words when viewed in the mirror are also known as glass door ambigrams, because they can be printed on a glass door to be read differently when entering or exiting.<ref name=\"John Langdon\"/>\n\n; Multi-Lingual : An ambigram that can be read one way in one language and another way in a different language. Multi-lingual ambigrams can exist in all of the various styles of ambigrams, with multi-lingual perceptual shift ambigrams being particularly striking. The name '''sinosign''' has been proposed for the case of the shift being between [[Latin script]] and [[Hanzi|Chinese script]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n; Natural :A natural ambigram is a word that possesses one or more of the above symmetries when written in its natural state, requiring no typographic styling.  For example, the words \"dollop\", \"suns\" and \"pod\" form natural rotational ambigrams. In Korean,  \uacf0 (bear) and \ubb38 (door) form a natural rotational ambigram. In some fonts, the word \"swims\" forms a natural rotational ambigram.

The words \"CHOICE\" and \"OXIDE\", in all capitals, form natural mirror ambigrams when reflected over a horizontal axis.  The longest such word is CHECKBOOK. The word \"TOOTH\", in all capitals, forms a natural mirror ambigram when its letters are stacked vertically and reflected over a vertical axis.  See the article ''[[transformation of text]]'' for a discussion of letter symmetry.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n;Perceptual Shift (Oscillation) :A design with no symmetry but can be read as two different words depending on how the curves of the letters are interpreted.<ref name=\"John Langdon\"/>\n\n; Rotational : A design that presents several instances of words when rotated through a fixed angle.  This is usually 180 degrees, but rotational ambigrams of other angles exist, for example 90 or 45 degrees.  The word spelled out from the alternative direction(s) is often the same, but may be a different word to the initially presented form.  A simple example is the lower-case abbreviation for \"Down\", ''dn'', which looks like the lower-case word ''up'' when rotated 180 degrees.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n; [[Strobogrammatic number|Strobogrammatic]]: A natural rotational ambigram consisting of numerical digits.\n\n; Space-Filling : Similar to chain ambigrams, but tile to fill the 2-dimensional plane.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n; Spinonym : An ambigram in which all the letters are made of the same glyph, possibly rotated and/or inverted.

Thus, the generated ambigrams are in general of poor quality when compared to hand made ambigrams. \n\nMore sophisticated techniques employ databases of thousands of curves to create complex ambigrams.\n\nA few ambigram generators are [[Free software|free]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jeux-et-mathematiques.davalan.org/liens/liens_ambi.html|title=Davalan Ambigram Generator|website=Davalan.org|url-status=live|access-date=1 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://makeambigrams.com/ambigram-generator/|title=The Make Ambigrams Ambigram Generator|website=MakeAmbigrams.com|url-status=live|access-date=1 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://trulyscience.com/ambigram-generator/|title=Truly Science Free Ambigram Generator|website=trulyscience|access-date=2 April 2020}}</ref>, while others are run by [[privately held companies]].\n\n==Other names==\nAmbigrams have also been called, among other things:\n* vertical [[palindrome]]s (1965)<ref>{{cite book|last=Borgmann |first=Dmitri |authorlink=Dmitri Borgmann |title=[[Language on Vacation: An Olio of Orthographical Oddities]]  |publisher=Scribner |year=1965 |asin=B0007FH4IE|page=27}}</ref>\n* designatures (1979)<ref>OMNI magazine, September 1979, page 143, work of Scott Kim.</ref>\n* inversions (1980)<ref>{{cite book |last=Kim |first=Scott |title=Inversions: Catalogue of Calligraphic Cartwheels |publisher=McGraw-Hill Inc., US |year=1980 |isbn=0-07-034546-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/inversionscatalo00kims }}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Ambigram Say Yes radial pattern rainbow color - rotation animation.gif|Rotational ambigram, ''Say Yes''\nFile:Vegas ambigram.svg|Rotational ambigram, ''Vegas''\nFile:Ambigram-wiki.svg|Mirror-image ambigram, ''Wiki''\nFile:3d-ambigram.jpg|Three-dimensional ambigram, ''ABC''\nFile:Wave-particle.jpg|Perceptual shift ambigram, [[Wave-particle duality|''Wave'' and ''Particle'']]\nFile:Spinonym neun.JPG|Spinonym, ''[[9 (number)|neun]]'' (German for nine) 9\nFile:Ambigram Two in One.png|Rotational ambigram, ''Two in One''\nFile:Rainbow reflection ambigram.jpg|Mirror ambigrams reading ''Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet'', ''Doug'' (for Douglas Hofstadter, signature)\nFile:Ambigram-8-eight-math-2-1-5-rotation-mirror-basile-morin.gif|Mirror and rotational ambigram of an arithmetic operation illustrating the [[commutative property]], ''2+1+5=8''\nFile:Typism book one ambigram Love Song by Basile Morin.jpg|Mirror ambigram ''Love Song'' in a book\nFile:Ambigram tattoo Stay here written on feet.jpg|Ambigram [[tattoo]] ''Stay here'' written on feet\nFile:Ambigram_tattoo_Texas_Sexy.jpg| Ambigram [[tattoo]] ''[[:en:Texas#Arts|Texas]] / [[:en:Sexual attraction|Sexy]]''\nFile:Wikipedia ambigram font.svg| Ambigram ''Wikipedia''\nFile:ABBA-Logo.svg| Ambigram ''[[ABBA]]''\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Palindrome]]\n* [[Anagram]]\n* [[Mirror writing]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n<!-- Refs are in chronological order -->\n* [[Dmitri Borgmann|Borgmann, Dmitri A.]], ''[[Language on Vacation: An Olio of Orthographical Oddities]]'', Charles Scribner's Sons (1965)\n* [[Scott Kim|Kim, Scott]], ''Inversions: A Catalog of Calligraphic Cartwheels,'' Byte Books (1981, republished 1996)\n* [[Douglas R.

Most scholars generally identify him with [[Xerxes I]] of Persia, as did 19th-century Bible commentaries.<ref>\"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1454354 The Religious Policy of Xerxes and the 'Book of Esther']\", Littman, Robert J., ''The Jewish Quarterly Review'', 65.3, January 1975, p.145\u2013148.</ref> Three factors, among others, contribute to this identification:\n\n# It is agreed the Hebrew 'Ahasuerus' descended from the Persian names for Xerxes I. Additionally, the form of the king's name written in Esther 10:1, ''\u2019a\u1e25a\u0161\u0113r\u014d\u0161'' (Hebrew: {{Hebrew|\u05d0\u05b2\u05d7\u05b7\u05e9\u05b5\u05c1\u05e8\u05b9\u05e9\u05c1}}) bears much more resemblance to the original old Persian ''X\u0161ay\u0101r\u0161a'' than the standard Hebrew form which does not omit the word\u2019s [[waw (letter)|vavim]].\n# Historian [[Herodotus]] records Xerxes I having penchants for women and wine, as well as mentioning the king ruled from India to Ethiopia in a magnificent palace in Shusan ([[Susa]]), all of which the Book of Esther corroborates. Herodotus also mentions that Xerxes I sought comfort in his [[harem]] following his [[Battle of Salamis|defeat at Salamis]] in the tenth month of his seventh year as king,{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} which is strikingly similar to the date of Ahasuerus choosing beautiful women from his harem in the tenth month of his seventh year as king (Esther 2:16).\n# Annals from the reign of Xerxes I mention an otherwise unattested official by the name of \"Marduka\", which some have proposed refers to Mordecai, as both are mentioned serving in the king's court.\n\nHowever, the Septuagint, the Vulgate, the [[Midrash]] of ''Esther Rabbah, I, 3'' and the [[Josippon]] identify the king as [[Artaxerxes I]], and the historian [[Josephus]] relates that this was the name by which he was known to the Greeks.<ref>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=967&letter=A Ahasuerus] at the JewishEncyclopedia.com</ref> The [[Ethiopia|Ethiopic]] text calls him ''Ar\u0165eksis'', usually the Ethiopic equivalent of ''Artaxerxes''.\n\n{{Original research section|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[John of Ephesus]] and [[Bar-Hebraeus]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://syri.ac/bhchronicles|title=Chronicles of Bar Hebraeus {{!}} syri.ac|website=syri.ac|language=en|access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref> identified him as [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]], a view strongly supported by the 20th century scholar [[Jacob Hoschander]].<ref name=\"Hosch\">Jacob Hoschander, ''The Book of Esther in the Light of History'', Oxford University Press, 1923</ref>{{page number|date=December 2019}}{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} [[Masudi]] recorded the Persian view of events which affirms the identification and [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]] similarly placed the events during the time of Artaxerxes II despite being confused by the Hebrew name for the king. ''Esther Rabba'' and the Vulgate present \"Ahasuerus\" as a different name for the king to \"Artaxerxes\" rather than an equivalent in different languages, and the Septuagint distinguished between the two names using a Greek transliteration of Ahasuerus for occurrences outside the Book of Esther. Indeed, an inscription from the time of Artaxerxes II records that he was also known as ''Arshu'' understood to be a shortening of the Babylonian form ''Achshiyarshu'' derived from the Persian ''Khshayarsha'' (Xerxes). The Greek historians [[Ctesias]] and [[Deinon]] noted that Artaxerxes II was also called ''Arsicas'' or ''Oarses'' respectively similarly understood to be derived from ''Khshayarsha'', the former as the shortened form together with the Persian suffix ''-ke'' applied to such shortened names;<ref name=\"Hosch\" />{{page number|date=December 2019}}{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} whereas in reality the Greek ''Artaxerxes'' is for the [[Old Persian]] ''Artax\u0161a\u00e7a'' (with /''\u00e7''/ for non-Persian /''\u03b8r''/, that is, ''Artax\u0161a\u03b8ra'', [[New Persian]] ''Ardashir'' \u0627\u0631\u062f\u0634\u06cc\u0631) < ''arta-'' 'justice' and ''x\u0161a\u00e7a-'' 'kingdom,' 'Having a kingdom of justice.' As is evident, the two names have different etymologies.\nIn his ''Historia Scholastica'' [[Petrus Comestor]] similarly identified Ahasuerus of Esther as the predecessor of a king called Artaxerxes (usually translated into English as Ahasuerus) who was also called Ochus i.e. [[Artaxerxes III]] thus also identifying the former Ahasuerus as Artaxerxes II. Comestor notes that Ochus had reconquered Egypt after the Ahasuerus of the book of Esther had lost it to pharaoh [[Amyrtaeus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Historia_Scholastica/Esther#De_Ocho_seu_Artaxerxe.|title=Historia Scholastica/Esther - Wikisource|author=|date=|website=la.wikisource.org|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Book of Ezra===\n[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz van Rijn - Ahasuerus, Haman and Esther - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Ahasuerus and [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]] at [[Ahasuerus and Haman at the Feast of Esther|Esther's Feast]]'', by [[Rembrandt]]]]\nAhasuerus is also given as the name of a [[King of Persia]] in the [[Book of Ezra]].<ref>{{bibleref|Ezra|4:5-7}}</ref> Modern commentators associate him with [[Xerxes I]] who reigned from 486 BC until 465 BC.

Thus this Ahasuerus is commonly identified with Astyages. He is alternatively identified, together with the Ahasuerus of the Book of Tobit, as Cyaxares I, said to be the father of Astyages. Views differ on how to reconcile the sources in this case. One view is that the description of Ahasuerus as the \"father\" of Darius the Mede should be understood in the broader sense of \"forebear\" or \"ancestor.\" Another view notes that on the [[Behistun Inscription]], \"Cyaxares\" is a family name, and thus considers the description as literal, viewing Astyages as an intermediate ruler wrongly placed in the family line in the Greek sources.\n\n===Book of Tobit===\nIn some versions of the [[deuterocanon]]ical Book of Tobit, Ahasuerus is given as the name of an associate of [[Nebuchadrezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]], who together with him, destroyed [[Nineveh]] just before Tobit's death.<ref>Book of Tobit, 14:15.</ref>  A traditional [[Catholic]] view is that he is identical to the Ahasuerus of Daniel 9:1<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02005c.htm Maas, Anthony (1907).

Most scholars generally identify him with [[Xerxes I]] of Persia, as did 19th-century Bible commentaries.<ref>\"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1454354 The Religious Policy of Xerxes and the 'Book of Esther']\", Littman, Robert J., ''The Jewish Quarterly Review'', 65.3, January 1975, p.145\u2013148.</ref> Three factors, among others, contribute to this identification:\n\n# It is agreed the Hebrew 'Ahasuerus' descended from the Persian names for Xerxes I. Additionally, the form of the king's name written in Esther 10:1, ''\u2019a\u1e25a\u0161\u0113r\u014d\u0161'' (Hebrew: {{Hebrew|\u05d0\u05b2\u05d7\u05b7\u05e9\u05b5\u05c1\u05e8\u05b9\u05e9\u05c1}}) bears much more resemblance to the original old Persian ''X\u0161ay\u0101r\u0161a'' than the standard Hebrew form which does not omit the word\u2019s [[waw (letter)|vavim]].\n# Historian [[Herodotus]] records Xerxes I having penchants for women and wine, as well as mentioning the king ruled from India to Ethiopia in a magnificent palace in Shusan ([[Susa]]), all of which the Book of Esther corroborates. Herodotus also mentions that Xerxes I sought comfort in his [[harem]] following his [[Battle of Salamis|defeat at Salamis]] in the tenth month of his seventh year as king,{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} which is strikingly similar to the date of Ahasuerus choosing beautiful women from his harem in the tenth month of his seventh year as king (Esther 2:16).\n# Annals from the reign of Xerxes I mention an otherwise unattested official by the name of \"Marduka\", which some have proposed refers to Mordecai, as both are mentioned serving in the king's court.\n\nHowever, the Septuagint, the Vulgate, the [[Midrash]] of ''Esther Rabbah, I, 3'' and the [[Josippon]] identify the king as [[Artaxerxes I]], and the historian [[Josephus]] relates that this was the name by which he was known to the Greeks.<ref>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=967&letter=A Ahasuerus] at the JewishEncyclopedia.com</ref> The [[Ethiopia|Ethiopic]] text calls him ''Ar\u0165eksis'', usually the Ethiopic equivalent of ''Artaxerxes''.\n\n{{Original research section|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[John of Ephesus]] and [[Bar-Hebraeus]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://syri.ac/bhchronicles|title=Chronicles of Bar Hebraeus {{!}} syri.ac|website=syri.ac|language=en|access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref> identified him as [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]], a view strongly supported by the 20th century scholar [[Jacob Hoschander]].<ref name=\"Hosch\">Jacob Hoschander, ''The Book of Esther in the Light of History'', Oxford University Press, 1923</ref>{{page number|date=December 2019}}{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} [[Masudi]] recorded the Persian view of events which affirms the identification and [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]] similarly placed the events during the time of Artaxerxes II despite being confused by the Hebrew name for the king. ''Esther Rabba'' and the Vulgate present \"Ahasuerus\" as a different name for the king to \"Artaxerxes\" rather than an equivalent in different languages, and the Septuagint distinguished between the two names using a Greek transliteration of Ahasuerus for occurrences outside the Book of Esther. Indeed, an inscription from the time of Artaxerxes II records that he was also known as ''Arshu'' understood to be a shortening of the Babylonian form ''Achshiyarshu'' derived from the Persian ''Khshayarsha'' (Xerxes). The Greek historians [[Ctesias]] and [[Deinon]] noted that Artaxerxes II was also called ''Arsicas'' or ''Oarses'' respectively similarly understood to be derived from ''Khshayarsha'', the former as the shortened form together with the Persian suffix ''-ke'' applied to such shortened names;<ref name=\"Hosch\" />{{page number|date=December 2019}}{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} whereas in reality the Greek ''Artaxerxes'' is for the [[Old Persian]] ''Artax\u0161a\u00e7a'' (with /''\u00e7''/ for non-Persian /''\u03b8r''/, that is, ''Artax\u0161a\u03b8ra'', [[New Persian]] ''Ardashir'' \u0627\u0631\u062f\u0634\u06cc\u0631) < ''arta-'' 'justice' and ''x\u0161a\u00e7a-'' 'kingdom,' 'Having a kingdom of justice.' As is evident, the two names have different etymologies.\nIn his ''Historia Scholastica'' [[Petrus Comestor]] similarly identified Ahasuerus of Esther as the predecessor of a king called Artaxerxes (usually translated into English as Ahasuerus) who was also called Ochus i.e. [[Artaxerxes III]] thus also identifying the former Ahasuerus as Artaxerxes II. Comestor notes that Ochus had reconquered Egypt after the Ahasuerus of the book of Esther had lost it to pharaoh [[Amyrtaeus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Historia_Scholastica/Esther#De_Ocho_seu_Artaxerxe.|title=Historia Scholastica/Esther - Wikisource|author=|date=|website=la.wikisource.org|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Book of Ezra===\n[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz van Rijn - Ahasuerus, Haman and Esther - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Ahasuerus and [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]] at [[Ahasuerus and Haman at the Feast of Esther|Esther's Feast]]'', by [[Rembrandt]]]]\nAhasuerus is also given as the name of a [[King of Persia]] in the [[Book of Ezra]].<ref>{{bibleref|Ezra|4:5-7}}</ref> Modern commentators associate him with [[Xerxes I]] who reigned from 486 BC until 465 BC.

Thus this Ahasuerus is commonly identified with Astyages. He is alternatively identified, together with the Ahasuerus of the Book of Tobit, as Cyaxares I, said to be the father of Astyages. Views differ on how to reconcile the sources in this case. One view is that the description of Ahasuerus as the \"father\" of Darius the Mede should be understood in the broader sense of \"forebear\" or \"ancestor.\" Another view notes that on the [[Behistun Inscription]], \"Cyaxares\" is a family name, and thus considers the description as literal, viewing Astyages as an intermediate ruler wrongly placed in the family line in the Greek sources.\n\n===Book of Tobit===\nIn some versions of the [[deuterocanon]]ical Book of Tobit, Ahasuerus is given as the name of an associate of [[Nebuchadrezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]], who together with him, destroyed [[Nineveh]] just before Tobit's death.<ref>Book of Tobit, 14:15.</ref>  A traditional [[Catholic]] view is that he is identical to the Ahasuerus of Daniel 9:1<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02005c.htm Maas, Anthony (1907).
