The \u201cSzalma\u201d part of the village's name comes from the Pecheneg word for border guard. \u201cTercs\u201d is of [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] origin, possibly meaning target. A [[Papal]] [[tithing]] list from 1332-37 represents the first documentary evidence of the village. The inhabitants apparently moved to the site of the present village from a nearby valley.\n\nIn 1548, the two main local landowners were the infamous Ferenc Bebek and the famed defender of the Bussa ([[Bu\u0161ince]]) fortress Mih\u00e1ly Szalmatercsy. In the course of the second half of the 16th century, the region was captured and occupied by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces. Under Ottoman rule, the parish church of Szalmatercs was destroyed. (It was not until 2006 that a replacement [[Catholic]] church was built in the village.)\n\nIn 1598, the village came under the ownership of Mih\u00e1ly Tercsy. By this time, the village comprised two parts, separated by the M\u00e9nes stream ([[M\u00e9nes-patak]]). Little Szalmatercs (latterly Pusztatercs) was inhabited by the [[nobles]], while the local [[serfs]] lived in Great Szalmatercs, to the north of the stream.\n\nIn the first half of the 17th century, the village belonged to Ipolymagyari ([[Uhorsk\u00e9]]) and was owned by Anna Majt\u00e9nyi Kosztol\u00e1nyi. In 1670, the village was mentioned as the [[feudal]] estate of Istv\u00e1n Koh\u00e1ry, while in 1720 it was recorded as a noble parish. In the 18th century, a part of the village became a feudal parish once more. The other part constituted a separate village until 1864.\n\nLocal landowners included the Pongr\u00e1cz family, \u00c1brah\u00e1m Komj\u00e1thy, \u00c1d\u00e1m Szilassy, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Plachy and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Ruttkay. In the second half of the 18th century, K\u00e1roly Ruttkay built a [[mansion]] (''k\u00faria'') in the village, which still stands.<ref>Ferenc Szmorad and P\u00e9ter T\u0151zs\u00e9r, Fejezetek Szalmatercs k\u00f6zs\u00e9g t\u00f6rt\u00e9net\u00e9b\u0151l (Szalmatercs, 1999)</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n\nIn 1910, Szalmatercs had 450 inhabitants: 425 [[Roman Catholics]], 17 [[Lutherans]], and 8 people of [[Jewish religion]].

There is a Gothic window on the south side of the ship, a tombstone on the wall around 1630 and a pulpit in 1817. The Upper Sanctuary's Reformed Church was built in Baroque style, and was not acquired until the 19th century.

It was the scene of constant battles during the Hussite wars. It was inhabited only in the same state in 1726. The Reformed church was built around 1782\u20131786, and its population reached the village by way of settlement - 447 persons, mainly of the Reformed religion. 56, that is, 5-6 families usually lived in a house, and around 1830 a manor house was built, the landlord was the Tur\u00e1nszky family. In 869 it had 388 inhabitants and in 1920 it had 423 inhabitants, in 1878 flooding of the river Hern\u00e1d destroyed many houses in the village.

Eminent citizens such as [[C. V. Raman]], Lt. Col. [[R. B. Seymour Sewell|Seymour Sewell]] and [[J. C. Ghosh]] had proposed the creation of an advisory board of scientific research. [[Sir Richard Gregory, 1st Baronet|Sir Richard Gregory]], then editor of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', was among the first people who officially reported to the [[British Government]]. After visiting scientific departments and universities in India in 1933, Gregory submitted to [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Samuel Hoare]], [[Secretary of State for India]], regarding the need of scientific organisation similar to the [[Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (United Kingdom)|DSIR]] in Britain. Indian scientists at [[Calcutta]] and [[Bangalore]] initiated schemes to launch a National Institute of Sciences and an [[Indian Academy of Sciences]], respectively. At the Fifth Industries Conference in 1933, the Provincial Governments of [[Bombay]], [[Madras]], [[Bihar]] and [[Orissa, India|Orissa]] unanimously reiterated their demand for a co-ordinating forum for industrial research. Hoare advised the [[Viceroy of India|Viceroy]], [[Lord Willingdon]], to support the demand. However, in May 1934, Willingdon replied to Hoare saying, \"The creation of a Department of Scientific and Industrial Research in India to promote the application of research to natural resources does not appear to be necessary.\" While the Indian DSIR was rejected, the colonial government provided a small concession. It instead offered to create an Industrial Intelligence and Research Bureau, which came into operation in April 1935 under the Indian Stores Department. The Bureau's limited resources (with a budget of [[Indian rupee|INR]] 1.0 lakh per annum) made it impossible to initiate major research and industrial activities as had been hoped for; it was mainly concerned with testing and quality control.<ref name=vig>{{cite web |author=Vigyan Prasar Science Portal |title=Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar |url=http://www.vigyanprasar.gov.in/scientists/ssbhatnagar/shantiswarupbhatnagar.htm |publisher=[[Vigyan Prasar]] |accessdate=11 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018015234/http://www.vigyanprasar.gov.in/scientists/ssbhatnagar/ShantiSwarupBhatnagar.htm |archivedate=18 October 2013 }}</ref>\n\nAt the onset of [[World War II]] in 1939, the bureau was proposed to be abolished. Arguably, [[Arcot Ramaswamy Mudaliar]] became the most instrumental in the creation of CSIR in India.<ref name=siva>{{cite journal |author= Sivaram C |title= The genesis of CSIR |url= http://sap.csir.res.in/FoundationDay2012/files/Article_by_Dr_Sivaram.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150507071911/http://sap.csir.res.in/FoundationDay2012/files/Article_by_Dr_Sivaram.pdf |url-status= dead |archive-date= 2015-05-07 |journal= Resonance |volume= 7 |issue= 4 |pages= 98 |year= 2002 |doi= 10.1007/BF02836144 }}</ref> As a member of Viceroy's executive council, and also of Commerce, he recommended that the Bureau should be terminated, not as a measure of economy, but to make room for a Board of Scientific and Industrial Research, which should be endowed with greater resources and wider objectives. It was by this persistence that the Board of Scientific and Industrial Research (BSIR) was created on 1 April 1940 for a period of two years. Mudaliar became the chair of the board. It was at this point that Bhatnagar was appointed to pilot the board, as the Director. The BSIR was allocated an annual budget of INR 500,000 under the Department of Commerce. By the end of 1940, about 80 researchers were engaged, of whom one-quarter was directly employed. Major achievements of BSIR included development of the techniques for the purification of [[Baluchistan]] [[sulphur]] anti-gas cloth manufacture, vegetable oil blends as fuel and lubricants, plastic packing cases for army boots and ammunition, dyes for uniforms and the preparation of [[vitamins]], and the invention of a [[pyrethrum]] [[emulsifier]] and cream. In early 1941 Bhatnagar persuaded the government to set up an Industrial Research Utilisation Committee (IRUC) for translating results into application. The government then agreed to make a separate fund out of the [[royalties]] received from industry for further investment into industrial research. Mudaliar recommended that an Industrial Research Fund should be constituted, which would have an annual grant of INR 1,000,000 (one million) for a period of five years. This was accepted by the Central Assembly in [[Delhi]] at its session on 14 November 1941.\n\nThen the constitution of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) as an autonomous body was prepared under Mudaliar and Bhatnagar. Thus, CSIR came into operation on 26 September 1942. The BSIR and IRUC were incorporated into the advisory bodies to the governing body of the CSIR. In 1943 the governing body of CSIR approved the proposal of Bhatnagar, though the initiative of [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], to establish five national laboratories \u2014 the National Chemical Laboratory, the National Physical Laboratory, the Fuel Research Station, the Glass & Ceramics Research Institute and the [[National Metallurgical Laboratory]]. In 1944 in addition to its annual budget of INR 1 million, CSIR received a grant of INR 10 million for the establishment of these laboratories. The Tata Industrial House donated INR 2 million for the chemical, metallurgical and fuel research laboratories.<ref name=vig/> The foundation for the [[Central Glass and Ceramic Research Institute]] at [[Kolkata]] was the first to be laid, in December 1945; [[National Metallurgical Laboratory]] at [[Jamshedpur]] in November 1946; and that for the [[National Chemical Laboratory]] at [[Pune]] was the last, on 6 April 1947, four months before [[Partition of India|India became independent]].<ref>{{cite journal| author= Sivaram S| title= Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar: A Visionary Extraordinary| year= 2002| url= http://www.ias.ac.in/resonance/April2002/pdf/April2002p90-97.pdf| journal= [[Resonance (journal)|Resonance]]| volume= 7| issue= 4| pages= 90\u201397| doi= 10.1007/bf02836142| url-status= live| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160109214250/http://www.ias.ac.in/resonance/April2002/pdf/April2002p90-97.pdf| archivedate= 9 January 2016| df= dmy-all}}</ref> All the five establishments were completed by 1950.<ref name=siva/>\n\n== Organization Structure ==\n\n# '''President :''' [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] (Ex-Officio) <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.csir.res.in/about-us/organisational-structure|title=Organisational Structure {{!}} Council of Scientific & Industrial Research {{!}} GoI|website=www.csir.res.in|language=en|access-date=2018-09-04}}</ref>\n# '''Vice President :''' [[Minister of Science and Technology (India)|Minister of Science & Technology, India]] (Ex-Officio)\n# '''Governing Body :''' The Director General is the head of the governing body.

Eminent citizens such as [[C. V. Raman]], Lt. Col. [[R. B. Seymour Sewell|Seymour Sewell]] and [[J. C. Ghosh]] had proposed the creation of an advisory board of scientific research. [[Sir Richard Gregory, 1st Baronet|Sir Richard Gregory]], then editor of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', was among the first people who officially reported to the [[British Government]]. After visiting scientific departments and universities in India in 1933, Gregory submitted to [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Samuel Hoare]], [[Secretary of State for India]], regarding the need of scientific organisation similar to the [[Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (United Kingdom)|DSIR]] in Britain. Indian scientists at [[Calcutta]] and [[Bangalore]] initiated schemes to launch a National Institute of Sciences and an [[Indian Academy of Sciences]], respectively. At the Fifth Industries Conference in 1933, the Provincial Governments of [[Bombay]], [[Madras]], [[Bihar]] and [[Orissa, India|Orissa]] unanimously reiterated their demand for a co-ordinating forum for industrial research. Hoare advised the [[Viceroy of India|Viceroy]], [[Lord Willingdon]], to support the demand. However, in May 1934, Willingdon replied to Hoare saying, \"The creation of a Department of Scientific and Industrial Research in India to promote the application of research to natural resources does not appear to be necessary.\" While the Indian DSIR was rejected, the colonial government provided a small concession. It instead offered to create an Industrial Intelligence and Research Bureau, which came into operation in April 1935 under the Indian Stores Department. The Bureau's limited resources (with a budget of [[Indian rupee|INR]] 1.0 lakh per annum) made it impossible to initiate major research and industrial activities as had been hoped for; it was mainly concerned with testing and quality control.<ref name=vig>{{cite web |author=Vigyan Prasar Science Portal |title=Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar |url=http://www.vigyanprasar.gov.in/scientists/ssbhatnagar/shantiswarupbhatnagar.htm |publisher=[[Vigyan Prasar]] |accessdate=11 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018015234/http://www.vigyanprasar.gov.in/scientists/ssbhatnagar/ShantiSwarupBhatnagar.htm |archivedate=18 October 2013 }}</ref>\n\nAt the onset of [[World War II]] in 1939, the bureau was proposed to be abolished. Arguably, [[Arcot Ramaswamy Mudaliar]] became the most instrumental in the creation of CSIR in India.<ref name=siva>{{cite journal |author= Sivaram C |title= The genesis of CSIR |url= http://sap.csir.res.in/FoundationDay2012/files/Article_by_Dr_Sivaram.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150507071911/http://sap.csir.res.in/FoundationDay2012/files/Article_by_Dr_Sivaram.pdf |url-status= dead |archive-date= 2015-05-07 |journal= Resonance |volume= 7 |issue= 4 |pages= 98 |year= 2002 |doi= 10.1007/BF02836144 }}</ref> As a member of Viceroy's executive council, and also of Commerce, he recommended that the Bureau should be terminated, not as a measure of economy, but to make room for a Board of Scientific and Industrial Research, which should be endowed with greater resources and wider objectives. It was by this persistence that the Board of Scientific and Industrial Research (BSIR) was created on 1 April 1940 for a period of two years. Mudaliar became the chair of the board. It was at this point that Bhatnagar was appointed to pilot the board, as the Director. The BSIR was allocated an annual budget of INR 500,000 under the Department of Commerce. By the end of 1940, about 80 researchers were engaged, of whom one-quarter was directly employed. Major achievements of BSIR included development of the techniques for the purification of [[Baluchistan]] [[sulphur]] anti-gas cloth manufacture, vegetable oil blends as fuel and lubricants, plastic packing cases for army boots and ammunition, dyes for uniforms and the preparation of [[vitamins]], and the invention of a [[pyrethrum]] [[emulsifier]] and cream. In early 1941 Bhatnagar persuaded the government to set up an Industrial Research Utilisation Committee (IRUC) for translating results into application. The government then agreed to make a separate fund out of the [[royalties]] received from industry for further investment into industrial research. Mudaliar recommended that an Industrial Research Fund should be constituted, which would have an annual grant of INR 1,000,000 (one million) for a period of five years. This was accepted by the Central Assembly in [[Delhi]] at its session on 14 November 1941.\n\nThen the constitution of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) as an autonomous body was prepared under Mudaliar and Bhatnagar. Thus, CSIR came into operation on 26 September 1942. The BSIR and IRUC were incorporated into the advisory bodies to the governing body of the CSIR. In 1943 the governing body of CSIR approved the proposal of Bhatnagar, though the initiative of [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], to establish five national laboratories \u2014 the National Chemical Laboratory, the National Physical Laboratory, the Fuel Research Station, the Glass & Ceramics Research Institute and the [[National Metallurgical Laboratory]]. In 1944 in addition to its annual budget of INR 1 million, CSIR received a grant of INR 10 million for the establishment of these laboratories. The Tata Industrial House donated INR 2 million for the chemical, metallurgical and fuel research laboratories.<ref name=vig/> The foundation for the [[Central Glass and Ceramic Research Institute]] at [[Kolkata]] was the first to be laid, in December 1945; [[National Metallurgical Laboratory]] at [[Jamshedpur]] in November 1946; and that for the [[National Chemical Laboratory]] at [[Pune]] was the last, on 6 April 1947, four months before [[Partition of India|India became independent]].<ref>{{cite journal| author= Sivaram S| title= Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar: A Visionary Extraordinary| year= 2002| url= http://www.ias.ac.in/resonance/April2002/pdf/April2002p90-97.pdf| journal= [[Resonance (journal)|Resonance]]| volume= 7| issue= 4| pages= 90\u201397| doi= 10.1007/bf02836142| url-status= live| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160109214250/http://www.ias.ac.in/resonance/April2002/pdf/April2002p90-97.pdf| archivedate= 9 January 2016| df= dmy-all}}</ref> All the five establishments were completed by 1950.<ref name=siva/>\n\n== Organization Structure ==\n\n# '''President :''' [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] (Ex-Officio) <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.csir.res.in/about-us/organisational-structure|title=Organisational Structure {{!}} Council of Scientific & Industrial Research {{!}} GoI|website=www.csir.res.in|language=en|access-date=2018-09-04}}</ref>\n# '''Vice President :''' [[Minister of Science and Technology (India)|Minister of Science & Technology, India]] (Ex-Officio)\n# '''Governing Body :''' The Director General is the head of the governing body.

Tracing its history as far back as 1943, it came into operational service in 1961 and was still in use at the time of the [[Falklands War]].\n\nSeaslug was intended to engage high-flying targets such as reconnaissance aircraft or bombers before they could launch stand-off weapons. It was only fitted to the Royal Navy's eight [[County-class destroyer]]s which were designed around the missile system.  Later improvements meant that it could also be used against ships. Seaslug was only fired in anger once as an anti-aircraft missile, from {{HMS|Antrim|D18|6}} during the Falklands War, but missed its target. It was also used for surface bombardment.\n\nSeaslug's medium-range role was to be supplanted by a very long-range missile known as [[Blue Envoy]], but this was passed over in favour of a new medium-range system, [[Sea Dart]]. Sea Dart entered service in 1973 and replaced Seaslug through the 1980s as the {{sclass2-|County|destroyer}}s were removed from service.\n\n==Development==\n===Initial concept===\nIn 1943, the German ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' began the use of [[anti-shipping missile]]s and guided bombs in the Mediterranean Ocean during Allied operations against Italy. These weapons were released outside of [[anti-aircraft gun]] range, which meant that any operations lacking complete [[air superiority]] would be open to attack with little response by the ships.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=197}}\n\nThe [[Admiralty Signals and Radar Establishment|Admiralty Signals Establishment]] (ASE), in charge of the Navy's [[radar]] development, was working on new radars featuring [[radar lock-on]] that allowed them to accurately track aircraft at long range. This was part of the LRS.1 fire-control system that allowed large dual-purpose guns to attack bombers at long range.{{sfn|Harding|2005|p=254}}\n\nA contemporary project at Cossors, [[Brakemine]], was working on a system to allow a missile to keep itself centered within a radar beam, a concept known today as [[beam riding]]. The Navy decided to combine the two concepts, using the LRS.1's Type 909 radar with a new missile that differed from Brakemine primarily in requiring longer range and being more robust for shipborne use.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=197}}\n\n===LOPGAP===\nThe [[Fairey Aviation Company]] was at this time working on a missile project for the Ministry of Supply, [[Fairey Stooge|Stooge]]. Stooge was more like an armed drone aircraft than a missile, and its low speed and manual guidance meant it was not useful for interceptions outside the immediate area of the ship. Accordingly, Fairey was ordered to stop work on Stooge in favour of a much higher-performance radar-guided weapon,{{efn-lr|Existing Stooge airframes continued to be test-fired for a time.}} LOPGAP, short for \"Liquid Oxygen and Petrol Guided Anti-aircraft Projectile\", with the initial requirements released in December 1944.{{sfn|Twigge|1993|p=246}} LOPGAP soon moved from petrol to [[methanol]] which made the \"LOP\" inaccurate, and the name accordingly changed simply to GAP.{{sfn|Morton|1989|p=209}}\n\nA March 1945 report called for the first test launches of GAP from converted [[QF 3.7-inch AA gun|QF 3.7-inch air-aircraft gun]] mounts (the same were used for Stooge and Brakemine) within two months. They predicted the final system would be about {{convert|19|ft|abbr=on}} long and a twin-launcher would take up about the same room as a twin 5.25-inch gun turret. An April Staff Target called for the system to be able to engage an aircraft flying at {{convert|500|mph|abbr=on}} at altitudes up to {{convert|40,000|ft|abbr=on}} with a maximum weight of {{convert|500|lb|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=179}}\n\nIn a January 1947 Navy review, the program was given the name Seaslug. This called for a significantly larger weapon than initially envisioned in GAP, capable of single-stage vertical launch, a warhead (and guidance) of {{convert|200|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and an all-up weight of {{convert|1800|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Twigge|1993|p=28}} Development continued as before but was significantly hampered by the post-war exodus of engineering talent.{{sfn|Harding|2005|p=254}}\n\n===RTV===\nIn 1946, the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE) formed its Controlled Weapons Department, soon to become the Guided Weapons Department.{{sfn|Smith|1965|p=101}} They began considering the beam riding concept in partnership with the [[Telecommunications Research Establishment]] (TRE), the deliberately oddly-named department of the [[Air Ministry]] responsible for [[radar]] development. Over the next year, first Brakemine and then Stooge were moved to the RAE. Seaslug followed in 1947.{{sfn|Smith|1965|p=101}}\n\nTwo systems emerged from this centralization. The CTV.1 was a small unpowered Brakemine-like system devoted to the development of the guidance systems, launched using three [[RP-3]] rocket motors and controlled through the coast phase. A series of CTV designs followed, providing ever-increasing amounts of [[telemetry]] for the guidance and control systems work.{{sfn|Smith|1965|pp=104-105}} GAP became a purely research-oriented system, RTV.1 (rocket test vehicle), as opposed to a prototype missile design, and was used primarily as a platform for testing the rocket motors.{{sfn|Smith|1965|p=105}}{{sfn|Twigge|1993|p=247}}\n\nNoticing that the performance requirements outlined by the Navy, Army and Air Force were roughly the same, they proposed a two-stage development program, with Stage 1 delivering missiles in the mid-1950s with roughly {{convert|20|mi}} range with capability mostly against subsonic targets, and a Stage 2 of the early 1960s with greatly extended range on the order of {{convert|150|mi}} and able to attack supersonic aircraft. The GAP/RTV.1 efforts would be directed at the Stage 1 design, which would essentially be the Seaslug requirement.\n\nThe relatively small CTV could safely be launched at the Larkhill Range, part of the [[Royal School of Artillery]]. It was equipped with a parachute that allowed it to be recovered. This was not possible for the much longer-ranged RTV, which was fired from [[ParcAberporth|RAF Aberporth]] out over [[Cardigan Bay]] in Wales. The desire to reclaim the RTVs as well led to the opening of a parallel launch facility at the [[RAAF Woomera Range Complex]] and a program that led development of supersonic parachutes.{{sfn|Smith|1965|p=106}}\n\nAs RTV testing continued, the decision was made to build a larger version, RTV.2, which would be more typical of a production missile. During early testing, the design was further modified and renamed GPV, for General Purpose Test Vehicle. Several [[liquid rocket]] motors were tested as part of this program. Early tests demonstrated shifts in the [[center of gravity]] that required active damping, which in turn led to the lengthening of the overall fuselage to become the \"long round\". This version used forward-mounted boosters, which were mounted so their exhaust was just in front of the mid-mounted wings.{{sfn|Smith|1965|p=108}}\n\n===Project 502===\nAs work continued, it was recognized that development by the existing GAP participants would take too long and so a larger industry team was required. In 1949 this gave rise to the 'Project 502' group from industry, with [[Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft]] and [[Sperry Corporation#British Sperry|Sperry]] in March and [[General Electric Company|GEC]] in September.{{sfn|Twigge|1993|p=28}}\n\nThe 29 July 1949 update of the Staff Target called for a maximum range of {{convert|30000|yd|km|abbr=on}} and a minimum of {{convert|5000|yd|km|abbr=on}}. Maximum altitude should be 55,000&nbsp;ft, but 45,000 would be considered acceptable. A later updated pushed the range to {{convert|30000|-|60000|yd|km|abbr=on}} against a {{convert|600|kn|km/h|abbr=on}}, later {{convert|650|kn|km/h|abbr=on}}, target. It was assumed the targets would \"jink\" at 1G, so the missile needed to maneuver at 4G at sea level and 2.5G at 40,000&nbsp;ft. Additional requirements were the ability to switch between targets in 6 seconds.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=179}}\n\nThe designers ultimately selected a maximum range of 30,000&nbsp;yards, which included {{convert|6,000|yd|km|abbr=on}} of coasting after motor burn-out. This was about 50% better than the contemporary US [[RIM-2 Terrier|Terrier]] design. Hit probability was estimated to be 40% at maximum range, so salvos of three missiles would be fired at once, demanding a three-place launcher. This was later reduced back to a twin-launcher when it was realized accessing the missile in the middle launcher was difficult.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=179}}\n\n===Changing requirements===\nWhen the deployment of the Seaslug was first being considered, three classes of custom missile-firing ships were considered. The Task Force Ship would be capable of {{convert|30|kn|km/h|abbr=on}} and would tasked with fleet air defence. The Ocean Convoy Escort was a {{convert|17|kn|km/h|abbr=on}} vessel that would provide direct cover over seagoing convoys, while the {{convert|12|kn|km/h|abbr=on}} Coastal Convoy Escort would do the same closer to shore. At that time it was believed that [[aircraft carrier]]s would be able to provide adequate cover over the ocean, so attention turned to the Coastal Convoy Escort. Beginning in May 1953 a [[Beachy Head-class repair ship]] was converted into a prototype escort ship, {{HMS|Girdle Ness|}}, to test this fitting.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wise|first=Jon|title=RFA Girdle Ness: Sea Slug Missile Trials Ship|editor=John Jordan|publisher=Conway|location=London|year=2007|series=Warship 2007|pages=9\u201328|isbn=978-1-84486-041-8}}</ref>\n\nFor this role, the densest possible storage was required, so the initial design of a single booster rocket at the base end of the missile, as in most contemporary designs, was abandoned in favour of four smaller boosters wrapped around the fuselage, giving shorter overall length of about {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} without making the missile larger in diameter as the boosters fitted within the area of the control fins. If one of the boosters did not fire the thrust would be significantly off-axis, a possibility which was addressed by moving the boosters forward so their exhaust was near the centre of gravity of the missile, allowing the existing control surfaces to be effective. In contrast, the American Terrier missile was somewhat shorter at {{convert|13|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}}, but this required an additional tandem booster which took the overall length to {{convert|28|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=179}}\n\nIn 1954, during another review of the Navy's future operations, consideration turned from a \"hot war\" against the Soviets to a series of \"warm wars\" in the [[third world]]. Among other changes brought about by this review, including the cancellation of a future all-gun cruiser class and ending further conversion of WWII-era destroyers to [[Type 15 frigate]]s, the new environment meant that air cover by carriers could not be guaranteed, and the need for air defence for task-force sized units became the primary concern. A cut to carrier construction, capping the fleet at four, released funds for missile ship construction. In October 1954, a new design emerged that demanded the speed to keep up with a fleet in combat, have guns limited to self-defence, and carrying a single twin-missile launcher.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=181}}\n\nThe designs were continually modified in order to find a suitable arrangement. They started as early as 1953 with a mid-sized cruiser of {{convert|15000|LT|t|abbr=on}} carrying 60 to 90 missiles and a crew of 900. Admiral [[Ralph Edwards (Royal Navy officer)|Ralph Edwards]] pointed out it would be more useful to have a larger number of small ships with 10 to 20 missiles than one larger one, but attempts to design such a ship resulted in one with room for the weapons but not the crew needed to operate them. In May 1955 a wide variety of plans for designs between the two extremes were compared, ranging from 9,850 tons down to 4,550.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=182}} After continual comparison and revision, these plans finally gelled around what became the [[County-class destroyer]].{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=184}}\n\n===Testing===\nTest firings of the GAP-based examples, now known as Rocket Test Vehicle 1, or RTV.1, demonstrated beam riding in October 1956. The Navy had set a date of 1957 for a broad modernization of the fleet, so they desired Seaslug to be cleared for service in 1956. To this end, they accepted the use of liquid fuels in spite of the Navy's concerns with these fuels on ships. However, by 1956 a new [[solid fuel rocket]] had been developed by IMI Summerfield which provided the desired range.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=180}}\n\nContinual tests took place over the next four years using both the [[Clausen Rolling Platform]] at [[RAE Aberporth]] and the ''Girdle Ness''. A final series of tests at sea, which culminated in sixteen successful firings, finally cleared the missile for service in 1961.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=180}} After more than 250 launches, the Seaslug Mark 1, also known as Guided Weapon System 1, or GWS.1, finally entered service in 1962 on County-class, each fitted with a single twin missile launcher and a complete weapon system with one fire control set and 30 missiles. The Seaslug-armed cruisers were cancelled in 1957.{{sfn|Harding|2005|p=259}}\n\nSeaslug needed height, range and bearing information for targets. By 1955 the Royal Navy considered using the [[Type 984 radar]] on Seaslug-armed cruisers and destroyers to provide this. During development, the projected weight of the radar doubled, to the point where it could still potentially be mounted on cruisers, but was rejected for destroyers because it would have meant sacrificing their 4.5 in gun armament. The gun armament was regarded as essential for the navy's wider role outside the hot war mission. The solution adopted with the first batch of the County-class destroyers was to network them with ships carrying Type 984. The destroyers were given a reduced version of the [[Comprehensive Display System]] (CDS), which was fed by a [[Simplex communication|CDS-link receiver]] called DPD (Digital Picture Transmission or Translation).{{sfn|Harding|2005|p=259}}<ref name=Boslaugh66>{{cite book |title=When Computers Went to Sea: The Digitization of the United States Navy |first1= David L|last1=Boslaugh| page=66| url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Mi8MhzheOokC&q=Digital+Picture+Transmission+system#v=onepage&q=HMS%20Hermes&f=false|publisher=Matt Loeb|date=1999|isbn=0471472204}}</ref>\n\nThe final set for the County ships, actually more a cruiser type than a destroyer, was quite complex: a [[Type 965]] radar for early warning (P-band, 450 kW peak power, range over 175&nbsp;km), in the County Batch 2 the double antenna AKE-2 had two different frequency settings; a Type 992Q target indicator radar (3&nbsp;GHz, 1.75 MW peak power, 90&nbsp;km range); a Type 278 height finding set (80\u201390&nbsp;km); a Type 901 missile guidance radar (X band, 70&nbsp;km range), that in the Sea Slug Mk 2 had a continuous wave signal (but it was still a beam riding designation radar); a Type 904 fire control radar (used in the MRS-3 system, X-band, 50&nbsp;kW, 35&nbsp;km range) for surface targeting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littlewars.org.uk/Seaslug/radar.html|title=Seaslug|publisher=SR Jenkins}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nThe missile had four wrap-around booster motors that separated after launch. After separation, the main motor ignited to power the missile to the target. The booster motors were positioned at the side of the missile, but this unusual arrangement with the motor nozzles both angled outwards at 22.5\u00b0 and 22.5\u00b0 to the left, the missile entered a gentle roll at launch, evening out differences in the thrusts of the boosters. This meant that large stabilising fins as used on contemporary missiles in service with the [[Royal Air Force]] ([[Bristol Bloodhound]]) and the [[British Army]] ([[English Electric Thunderbird]]) were not required. Once the boosters were jettisoned the control surfaces became active.\n\nGuidance was by radar beam-riding, the beam to be provided by [[Type 901 radar|Type 901 fire-control radar]]. There were four flight modes:\n\n*LOSBR (Line Of Sight, Beam Riding), in which the missile flew up a beam that tracked the target\n*CASWTD (Constant Angle of Sight With Terminal Dive), with the missile climbing at a low angle and then diving onto a low-altitude target at 45\u00b0, used against low flying targets at over 12,000 yards away\n*MICAWBER (Missile In Constant Altitude While BEam Riding), used against low level target approaching at 500\u2013800 feet, it allows switching from CASWTD to LOSBR when the target is closing at the ship\n*Up and over: the standard surface attack mode, using the Type 901 radar slaved to the Type 903 in bearing; the missile is fired at high elevation and then depressed in order to strike the vessel with a steep dive, without arming the fuse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littlewars.org.uk/Seaslug/slugmode.html|title=Seaslug|publisher=SR Jenkins}}</ref>\n\nElectrical power when the missile was in flight was provided by a [[flux switching alternator]] with a six tooth rotor.  \"The 1.5 kVA Seaslug generator ran at 24,000 rev/min with a frequency of 2,400 Hz.\"<ref>''Guided Weapons'', by Geoffrey Lee, et al, pub Brassey's, 3rd edition, 1998, {{ISBN|1-85753-152-3}}, p59.</ref>\n\n==Service performance==\nSeaslug was a high-performance weapon in the 1960s, with a single-shot kill probability of 92%, although other sources give lower kill probabilities: 75% for the Mk 1 and 65% for the Mk 2.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littlewars.org.uk/Seaslug/seaslug03.html|title=Seaslug|publisher=SR Jenkins}}</ref> It was, however, limited by the complicated handling arrangements and since each County class ship carried only a single fire-control radar only one target could be engaged at once, though two missiles could be fired against it.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nThe cost of an individual Seaslug missile round in 1961 was approximately \u00a350,000.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nDuring the [[Falklands War]] Seaslug was only launched once against an aircraft target, by {{HMS|Antrim|D18|6}}, and did not hit. This is hardly surprising, as the Royal Navy considered the system to be obsolete and the low-level attacks experienced in the Falklands War were outside the missile's operational capacity. It was fired again in anger, this time against an Argentine radar at [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]] airfield that the [[Royal Air Force]] had been unable to destroy. During a shore bombardment {{HMS|Glamorgan|D19|6}} triangulated the last known position of the radar with her ESM and fired a Seaslug. She later fired several at the runway to cover it with debris which would have damaged any aircraft attempting to land or take off.  Results, if any, are unknown, but the spectacle of the launch sequence was something of a morale booster to the troops ashore.\n\nSeaslug was withdrawn as the County-class ships were decommissioned. {{HMS|Fife|D20|6}} was converted to a training ship, and had her Seaslug systems removed, freeing up large spaces for classrooms.\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Sea Slug trials.jpg|thumb|The firing of the first Seaslug test missile from [[HMS Girdle Ness (A387)|HMS ''Girdle Ness'' (A387)]].

It had a radio [[proximity fuze]] and {{convert|200|lb|abbr=on}} blast warhead.\n\nThe Mark 1 was a [[beam-riding guidance|beam rider]] missile, meaning the target had to be continually illuminated by the directing radar, so the system was limited to engaging only the number of targets that there were radars to track and lock on.\n\n*Particulars\n**Attack Velocity: {{convert|685|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}\n**Range: {{convert|30000|yd|m}}\n**Ceiling: {{convert|55000|ft|m}}\n\n===Mark 2 (GWS.2)===\nThe Seaslug Mark 2 was based on the aborted [[List of Rainbow Codes|Blue Slug]] programme to develop an anti-ship missile using the Seaslug missile and guidance system. The project was cancelled in favour of the [[Green Cheese (missile)|\"Green Cheese\" missile]], a tactical nuclear anti-ship weapon,  but other project developments were incorporated into what became the Mark 2. It had improved low altitude performance and a limited anti-ship capability and entered service in 1971. The Mark 2 utilized an improved [[beam-riding guidance]] system.<!-- {{efn-lr|Another common error is that the Mark-2 has semi-active guidance; actually, it was the same beam-rider than Mark-1 }} --> and solid-state electronics. It was powered by the ''Deerhound'' sustainer motor, with ''Retriever'' boosters. Control was by a modified Type 901M radar and it had an improved infra-red proximity fuze and a [[continuous-rod warhead]] with a smaller, {{convert|56|lb|abbr=on}}, explosive charge (RDX-TNT) and an unfold diameter of about 70 feet (10&nbsp;mm steel rods were used) \n\n*Attack velocity: {{convert|1370|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}\n*Range: {{convert|35000|yd|km|abbr=on}}\n*Ceiling: {{convert|65000|ft|m|abbr=on}}\n\nThe capabilities of the new Sea Slug Mk 2, an almost 2.5 ton missile, were much improved compared to the previous Mk 1. The boosters gave a total of about 60 tons-force, with {{convert|186|kg|abbr=on}} fuel for each one (145 kg in the Mk 1), accelerating it to over Mach 2. When they separated because the extreme drag made by the rings all around the missile, the solid fuel sustainer ''Deerhound'' started to burn its {{convert|440|kg|abbr=on}} of propellant (390 kg for the Mk 1) and gave about {{convert|1,820|kg/s|abbr=on}} for 38 seconds. The slender missile remained at over Mach 2-2.5 until the flameout. The missile was made fully controllable about ten seconds after firing, followed by a radio-beacon while it was centered in the radar beam; and armed the proxy fuse (infra-red) at about {{convert|1|km|yd|abbr=on}} from the target, if 'hot', while if 'cold' the missile was detonated by command sent from the ship. \nThe range could be even more than 35,000 yards, especially at high altitude, with head-on supersonic targets.

''Winkle'' was never built as it was quickly supplanted by ''Pixie'', a very small [[Nuclear weapon design|unboosted]] warhead with an all-plutonium fissile core [[British nuclear tests at Maralinga|tested]] at [[Maralinga, South Australia|Maralinga]], which was, in turn, replaced by ''Gwen'' \u2014 a British version of\nthe US [[W54]] ''Gnat'' unboosted warhead of approximate yield 1/2 - 2 [[Kiloton]] (kt). The final warhead choice was ''Tony'' - a UK version of the [[W44]] ''[[Tsetse primary|Tsetse]]'' [[Boosted fission weapon|boosted]] warhead, but all nuclear options for Seaslug were subsequently abandoned, and no nuclear-armed variant of Seaslug was ever deployed.\n\n==Operators==\n[[File:Sea Slug operators.png|thumb|400px|Map with Seaslug operators in blue]]\n\n===Royal Navy===\nThe County-class destroyers were specifically built to carry Seaslug and its associated control equipment.

The handling arrangements were designed with a nuclear-war environment in mind and were therefore entirely under cover.\n\n===Chilean Navy===\nSome of the County-class destroyers were sold to Chile for the [[Chilean Navy]].

Tracing its history as far back as 1943, it came into operational service in 1961 and was still in use at the time of the [[Falklands War]].\n\nSeaslug was intended to engage high-flying targets such as reconnaissance aircraft or bombers before they could launch stand-off weapons. It was only fitted to the Royal Navy's eight [[County-class destroyer]]s which were designed around the missile system.  Later improvements meant that it could also be used against ships. Seaslug was only fired in anger once as an anti-aircraft missile, from {{HMS|Antrim|D18|6}} during the Falklands War, but missed its target. It was also used for surface bombardment.\n\nSeaslug's medium-range role was to be supplanted by a very long-range missile known as [[Blue Envoy]], but this was passed over in favour of a new medium-range system, [[Sea Dart]]. Sea Dart entered service in 1973 and replaced Seaslug through the 1980s as the {{sclass2-|County|destroyer}}s were removed from service.\n\n==Development==\n===Initial concept===\nIn 1943, the German ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' began the use of [[anti-shipping missile]]s and guided bombs in the Mediterranean Ocean during Allied operations against Italy. These weapons were released outside of [[anti-aircraft gun]] range, which meant that any operations lacking complete [[air superiority]] would be open to attack with little response by the ships.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=197}}\n\nThe [[Admiralty Signals and Radar Establishment|Admiralty Signals Establishment]] (ASE), in charge of the Navy's [[radar]] development, was working on new radars featuring [[radar lock-on]] that allowed them to accurately track aircraft at long range. This was part of the LRS.1 fire-control system that allowed large dual-purpose guns to attack bombers at long range.{{sfn|Harding|2005|p=254}}\n\nA contemporary project at Cossors, [[Brakemine]], was working on a system to allow a missile to keep itself centered within a radar beam, a concept known today as [[beam riding]]. The Navy decided to combine the two concepts, using the LRS.1's Type 909 radar with a new missile that differed from Brakemine primarily in requiring longer range and being more robust for shipborne use.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=197}}\n\n===LOPGAP===\nThe [[Fairey Aviation Company]] was at this time working on a missile project for the Ministry of Supply, [[Fairey Stooge|Stooge]]. Stooge was more like an armed drone aircraft than a missile, and its low speed and manual guidance meant it was not useful for interceptions outside the immediate area of the ship. Accordingly, Fairey was ordered to stop work on Stooge in favour of a much higher-performance radar-guided weapon,{{efn-lr|Existing Stooge airframes continued to be test-fired for a time.}} LOPGAP, short for \"Liquid Oxygen and Petrol Guided Anti-aircraft Projectile\", with the initial requirements released in December 1944.{{sfn|Twigge|1993|p=246}} LOPGAP soon moved from petrol to [[methanol]] which made the \"LOP\" inaccurate, and the name accordingly changed simply to GAP.{{sfn|Morton|1989|p=209}}\n\nA March 1945 report called for the first test launches of GAP from converted [[QF 3.7-inch AA gun|QF 3.7-inch air-aircraft gun]] mounts (the same were used for Stooge and Brakemine) within two months. They predicted the final system would be about {{convert|19|ft|abbr=on}} long and a twin-launcher would take up about the same room as a twin 5.25-inch gun turret. An April Staff Target called for the system to be able to engage an aircraft flying at {{convert|500|mph|abbr=on}} at altitudes up to {{convert|40,000|ft|abbr=on}} with a maximum weight of {{convert|500|lb|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=179}}\n\nIn a January 1947 Navy review, the program was given the name Seaslug. This called for a significantly larger weapon than initially envisioned in GAP, capable of single-stage vertical launch, a warhead (and guidance) of {{convert|200|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and an all-up weight of {{convert|1800|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Twigge|1993|p=28}} Development continued as before but was significantly hampered by the post-war exodus of engineering talent.{{sfn|Harding|2005|p=254}}\n\n===RTV===\nIn 1946, the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE) formed its Controlled Weapons Department, soon to become the Guided Weapons Department.{{sfn|Smith|1965|p=101}} They began considering the beam riding concept in partnership with the [[Telecommunications Research Establishment]] (TRE), the deliberately oddly-named department of the [[Air Ministry]] responsible for [[radar]] development. Over the next year, first Brakemine and then Stooge were moved to the RAE. Seaslug followed in 1947.{{sfn|Smith|1965|p=101}}\n\nTwo systems emerged from this centralization. The CTV.1 was a small unpowered Brakemine-like system devoted to the development of the guidance systems, launched using three [[RP-3]] rocket motors and controlled through the coast phase. A series of CTV designs followed, providing ever-increasing amounts of [[telemetry]] for the guidance and control systems work.{{sfn|Smith|1965|pp=104-105}} GAP became a purely research-oriented system, RTV.1 (rocket test vehicle), as opposed to a prototype missile design, and was used primarily as a platform for testing the rocket motors.{{sfn|Smith|1965|p=105}}{{sfn|Twigge|1993|p=247}}\n\nNoticing that the performance requirements outlined by the Navy, Army and Air Force were roughly the same, they proposed a two-stage development program, with Stage 1 delivering missiles in the mid-1950s with roughly {{convert|20|mi}} range with capability mostly against subsonic targets, and a Stage 2 of the early 1960s with greatly extended range on the order of {{convert|150|mi}} and able to attack supersonic aircraft. The GAP/RTV.1 efforts would be directed at the Stage 1 design, which would essentially be the Seaslug requirement.\n\nThe relatively small CTV could safely be launched at the Larkhill Range, part of the [[Royal School of Artillery]]. It was equipped with a parachute that allowed it to be recovered. This was not possible for the much longer-ranged RTV, which was fired from [[ParcAberporth|RAF Aberporth]] out over [[Cardigan Bay]] in Wales. The desire to reclaim the RTVs as well led to the opening of a parallel launch facility at the [[RAAF Woomera Range Complex]] and a program that led development of supersonic parachutes.{{sfn|Smith|1965|p=106}}\n\nAs RTV testing continued, the decision was made to build a larger version, RTV.2, which would be more typical of a production missile. During early testing, the design was further modified and renamed GPV, for General Purpose Test Vehicle. Several [[liquid rocket]] motors were tested as part of this program. Early tests demonstrated shifts in the [[center of gravity]] that required active damping, which in turn led to the lengthening of the overall fuselage to become the \"long round\". This version used forward-mounted boosters, which were mounted so their exhaust was just in front of the mid-mounted wings.{{sfn|Smith|1965|p=108}}\n\n===Project 502===\nAs work continued, it was recognized that development by the existing GAP participants would take too long and so a larger industry team was required. In 1949 this gave rise to the 'Project 502' group from industry, with [[Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft]] and [[Sperry Corporation#British Sperry|Sperry]] in March and [[General Electric Company|GEC]] in September.{{sfn|Twigge|1993|p=28}}\n\nThe 29 July 1949 update of the Staff Target called for a maximum range of {{convert|30000|yd|km|abbr=on}} and a minimum of {{convert|5000|yd|km|abbr=on}}. Maximum altitude should be 55,000&nbsp;ft, but 45,000 would be considered acceptable. A later updated pushed the range to {{convert|30000|-|60000|yd|km|abbr=on}} against a {{convert|600|kn|km/h|abbr=on}}, later {{convert|650|kn|km/h|abbr=on}}, target. It was assumed the targets would \"jink\" at 1G, so the missile needed to maneuver at 4G at sea level and 2.5G at 40,000&nbsp;ft. Additional requirements were the ability to switch between targets in 6 seconds.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=179}}\n\nThe designers ultimately selected a maximum range of 30,000&nbsp;yards, which included {{convert|6,000|yd|km|abbr=on}} of coasting after motor burn-out. This was about 50% better than the contemporary US [[RIM-2 Terrier|Terrier]] design. Hit probability was estimated to be 40% at maximum range, so salvos of three missiles would be fired at once, demanding a three-place launcher. This was later reduced back to a twin-launcher when it was realized accessing the missile in the middle launcher was difficult.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=179}}\n\n===Changing requirements===\nWhen the deployment of the Seaslug was first being considered, three classes of custom missile-firing ships were considered. The Task Force Ship would be capable of {{convert|30|kn|km/h|abbr=on}} and would be carry out fleet air defence. The Ocean Convoy Escort was a {{convert|17|kn|km/h|abbr=on}} vessel that would provide direct cover over seagoing convoys, while the {{convert|12|kn|km/h|abbr=on}} Coastal Convoy Escort would do the same closer to shore. At that time it was believed that [[aircraft carrier]]s would be able to provide adequate cover over the ocean, so attention turned to the Coastal Convoy Escort. Beginning in May 1953 a [[Beachy Head-class repair ship]] was converted into a prototype escort ship, {{HMS|Girdle Ness|}}, to test this fitting.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wise|first=Jon|title=RFA Girdle Ness: Sea Slug Missile Trials Ship|editor=John Jordan|publisher=Conway|location=London|year=2007|series=Warship 2007|pages=9\u201328|isbn=978-1-84486-041-8}}</ref>\n\nFor this role, the densest possible storage was required, so the initial design of a single booster rocket at the base end of the missile, as in most contemporary designs, was abandoned in favour of four smaller boosters wrapped around the fuselage, giving shorter overall length of about {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} without making the missile larger in diameter as the boosters fitted within the area of the control fins. If one of the boosters did not fire the thrust would be significantly off-axis, a possibility which was addressed by moving the boosters forward so their exhaust was near the centre of gravity of the missile, allowing the existing control surfaces to be effective. In contrast, the American Terrier missile was somewhat shorter at {{convert|13|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}}, but this required an additional tandem booster which took the overall length to {{convert|28|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=179}}\n\nIn 1954, during another review of the Navy's future operations, consideration turned from a \"hot war\" against the Soviets to a series of \"warm wars\" in the [[third world]]. Among other changes brought about by this review, including the cancellation of a future all-gun cruiser class and ending further conversion of WWII-era destroyers to [[Type 15 frigate]]s, the new environment meant that air cover by carriers could not be guaranteed, and the need for air defence for task-force sized units became the primary concern. A cut to carrier construction, capping the fleet at four, released funds for missile ship construction. In October 1954, a new design emerged that demanded the speed to keep up with a fleet in combat, have guns limited to self-defence, and carrying a single twin-missile launcher.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=181}}\n\nThe designs were continually modified in order to find a suitable arrangement. They started as early as 1953 with a mid-sized cruiser of {{convert|15000|LT|t|abbr=on}} carrying 60 to 90 missiles and a crew of 900. Admiral [[Ralph Edwards (Royal Navy officer)|Ralph Edwards]] pointed out it would be more useful to have a larger number of small ships with 10 to 20 missiles than one larger one, but attempts to design such a ship resulted in one with room for the weapons but not the crew needed to operate them. In May 1955 a wide variety of plans for designs between the two extremes were compared, ranging from 9,850 tons down to 4,550.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=182}} After continual comparison and revision, these plans finally gelled around what became the [[County-class destroyer]].{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=184}}\n\n===Testing===\nTest firings of the GAP-based examples, now known as Rocket Test Vehicle 1, or RTV.1, demonstrated beam riding in October 1956. The Navy had set a date of 1957 for a broad modernization of the fleet, so they desired Seaslug to be cleared for service in 1956. To this end, they accepted the use of liquid fuels in spite of the Navy's concerns with these fuels on ships. However, by 1956 a new [[solid fuel rocket]] had been developed by IMI Summerfield which provided the desired range.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=180}}\n\nContinual tests took place over the next four years using both the [[Clausen Rolling Platform]] at [[RAE Aberporth]] and the ''Girdle Ness''. A final series of tests at sea, which culminated in sixteen successful firings, finally cleared the missile for service in 1961.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=180}} After more than 250 launches, the Seaslug Mark 1, also known as Guided Weapon System 1, or GWS.1, finally entered service in 1962 on County-class, each fitted with a single twin missile launcher and a complete weapon system with one fire control set and 30 missiles. The Seaslug-armed cruisers were cancelled in 1957.{{sfn|Harding|2005|p=259}}\n\nSeaslug needed height, range and bearing information for targets. By 1955 the Royal Navy considered using the [[Type 984 radar]] on Seaslug-armed cruisers and destroyers to provide this. During development, the projected weight of the radar doubled, to the point where it could still potentially be mounted on cruisers, but was rejected for destroyers because it would have meant sacrificing their 4.5 in gun armament. The gun armament was regarded as essential for the navy's wider role outside the hot war mission. The solution adopted with the first batch of the County-class destroyers was to network them with ships carrying Type 984. The destroyers were given a reduced version of the [[Comprehensive Display System]] (CDS), which was fed by a [[Simplex communication|CDS-link receiver]] called DPD (Digital Picture Transmission or Translation).{{sfn|Harding|2005|p=259}}<ref name=Boslaugh66>{{cite book |title=When Computers Went to Sea: The Digitization of the United States Navy |first1= David L|last1=Boslaugh| page=66| url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Mi8MhzheOokC&q=Digital+Picture+Transmission+system#v=onepage&q=HMS%20Hermes&f=false|publisher=Matt Loeb|date=1999|isbn=0471472204}}</ref>\n\nThe final set for the County ships, actually more a cruiser type than a destroyer, was quite complex: a [[Type 965]] radar for early warning (P-band, 450 kW peak power, range over 175&nbsp;km), in the County Batch 2 the double antenna AKE-2 had two different frequency settings; a Type 992Q target indicator radar (3&nbsp;GHz, 1.75 MW peak power, 90&nbsp;km range); a Type 278 height finding set (80\u201390&nbsp;km); a Type 901 missile guidance radar (X band, 70&nbsp;km range), that in the Sea Slug Mk 2 had a continuous wave signal (but it was still a beam riding designation radar); a Type 904 fire control radar (used in the MRS-3 system, X-band, 50&nbsp;kW, 35&nbsp;km range) for surface targeting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littlewars.org.uk/Seaslug/radar.html|title=Seaslug|publisher=SR Jenkins}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nThe missile had four wrap-around booster motors that separated after launch. After separation, the main motor ignited to power the missile to the target. The booster motors were positioned at the side of the missile, but this unusual arrangement with the motor nozzles both angled outwards at 22.5\u00b0 and 22.5\u00b0 to the left, the missile entered a gentle roll at launch, evening out differences in the thrusts of the boosters. This meant that large stabilising fins as used on contemporary missiles in service with the [[Royal Air Force]] ([[Bristol Bloodhound]]) and the [[British Army]] ([[English Electric Thunderbird]]) were not required. Once the boosters were jettisoned the control surfaces became active.\n\nGuidance was by radar beam-riding, the beam to be provided by [[Type 901 radar|Type 901 fire-control radar]]. There were four flight modes:\n\n*LOSBR (Line Of Sight, Beam Riding), in which the missile flew up a beam that tracked the target\n*CASWTD (Constant Angle of Sight With Terminal Dive), with the missile climbing at a low angle and then diving onto a low-altitude target at 45\u00b0, used against low flying targets at over 12,000 yards away\n*MICAWBER (Missile In Constant Altitude While BEam Riding), used against low level target approaching at 500\u2013800 feet, it allows switching from CASWTD to LOSBR when the target is closing at the ship\n*Up and over: the standard surface attack mode, using the Type 901 radar slaved to the Type 903 in bearing; the missile is fired at high elevation and then depressed in order to strike the vessel with a steep dive, without arming the fuse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littlewars.org.uk/Seaslug/slugmode.html|title=Seaslug|publisher=SR Jenkins}}</ref>\n\nElectrical power when the missile was in flight was provided by a [[flux switching alternator]] with a six tooth rotor.  \"The 1.5 kVA Seaslug generator ran at 24,000 rev/min with a frequency of 2,400 Hz.\"<ref>''Guided Weapons'', by Geoffrey Lee, et al, pub Brassey's, 3rd edition, 1998, {{ISBN|1-85753-152-3}}, p59.</ref>\n\n==Service performance==\nSeaslug was a high-performance weapon in the 1960s, with a single-shot kill probability of 92%, although other sources give lower kill probabilities: 75% for the Mk 1 and 65% for the Mk 2.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littlewars.org.uk/Seaslug/seaslug03.html|title=Seaslug|publisher=SR Jenkins}}</ref> It was, however, limited by the complicated handling arrangements and since each County class ship carried only a single fire-control radar only one target could be engaged at once, though two missiles could be fired against it.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nThe cost of an individual Seaslug missile round in 1961 was approximately \u00a350,000.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nDuring the [[Falklands War]] Seaslug was only launched once against an aircraft target, by {{HMS|Antrim|D18|6}}, and did not hit. This is hardly surprising, as the Royal Navy considered the system to be obsolete and the low-level attacks experienced in the Falklands War were outside the missile's operational capacity. It was fired again in anger, this time against an Argentine radar at [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]] airfield that the [[Royal Air Force]] had been unable to destroy. During a shore bombardment {{HMS|Glamorgan|D19|6}} triangulated the last known position of the radar with her ESM and fired a Seaslug. She later fired several at the runway to cover it with debris which would have damaged any aircraft attempting to land or take off.  Results, if any, are unknown, but the spectacle of the launch sequence was something of a morale booster to the troops ashore.\n\nSeaslug was withdrawn as the County-class ships were decommissioned. {{HMS|Fife|D20|6}} was converted to a training ship, and had her Seaslug systems removed, freeing up large spaces for classrooms.\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Sea Slug trials.jpg|thumb|The firing of the first Seaslug test missile from [[HMS Girdle Ness (A387)|HMS ''Girdle Ness'' (A387)]].

It had a radio [[proximity fuze]] and {{convert|200|lb|abbr=on}} blast warhead.\n\nThe Mark 1 was a [[beam-riding guidance|beam rider]] missile, meaning the target had to be continually illuminated by the directing radar, so the system was limited to engaging only the number of targets that there were radars to track and lock on.\n\n*Particulars\n**Attack Velocity: {{convert|685|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}\n**Range: {{convert|30000|yd|m}}\n**Ceiling: {{convert|55000|ft|m}}\n\n===Mark 2 (GWS.2)===\nThe Seaslug Mark 2 was based on the aborted [[List of Rainbow Codes|Blue Slug]] programme to develop an anti-ship missile using the Seaslug missile and guidance system. The project was cancelled in favour of the [[Green Cheese (missile)|\"Green Cheese\" missile]], a tactical nuclear anti-ship weapon,  but other project developments were incorporated into what became the Mark 2. It had improved low altitude performance and a limited anti-ship capability and entered service in 1971. The Mark 2 utilized an improved [[beam-riding guidance]] system.<!-- {{efn-lr|Another common error is that the Mark-2 has semi-active guidance; actually, it was the same beam-rider than Mark-1 }} --> and solid-state electronics. It was powered by the ''Deerhound'' sustainer motor, with ''Retriever'' boosters. Control was by a modified Type 901M radar and it had an improved infra-red proximity fuze and a [[continuous-rod warhead]] with a smaller, {{convert|56|lb|abbr=on}}, explosive charge (RDX-TNT) and an unfold diameter of about 70 feet (10&nbsp;mm steel rods were used) \n\n*Attack velocity: {{convert|1370|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}\n*Range: {{convert|35000|yd|km|abbr=on}}\n*Ceiling: {{convert|65000|ft|m|abbr=on}}\n\nThe capabilities of the new Sea Slug Mk 2, an almost 2.5 ton missile, were much improved compared to the previous Mk 1. The boosters gave a total of about 60 tons-force, with {{convert|186|kg|abbr=on}} fuel for each one (145 kg in the Mk 1), accelerating it to over Mach 2. When they separated because the extreme drag made by the rings all around the missile, the solid fuel sustainer ''Deerhound'' started to burn its {{convert|440|kg|abbr=on}} of propellant (390 kg for the Mk 1) and gave about {{convert|1,820|kg/s|abbr=on}} for 38 seconds. The slender missile remained at over Mach 2-2.5 until the flameout. The missile was made fully controllable about ten seconds after firing, followed by a radio-beacon while it was centered in the radar beam; and armed the proxy fuse (infra-red) at about {{convert|1|km|yd|abbr=on}} from the target, if 'hot', while if 'cold' the missile was detonated by command sent from the ship. \nThe range could be even more than 35,000 yards, especially at high altitude, with head-on supersonic targets. One of the longest shots recorded was made by HMS ''Antrim'' against a target over {{convert|58,000|yd|mi km|abbr=on}} away, with an impact at 34.500 with about 46 seconds flight time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littlewars.org.uk/Seaslug/firings.html|title=Seaslug firing reports |work=Littlewars|publisher=S R Jenkins |date=27 September 2016}}</ref> The missile was capable to reach potentially aven higher altitude and longer range than nominally assested: even after the engine flameout (over 40 seconds after launch), it retained very high speeds, and one of them even surpassed {{convert|85,000|ft|abbr=on}} before being self-destructed, about one minute after the firing <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littlewars.org.uk/Seaslug/whoops.html|title=Whoops -A firing that went slightly wrong! |date=6 June 2017 |work=Littlewars |publisher=S R Jenkins}}</ref>\n\nFor both Mark 1 and Mark 2 Sea Slug there were [[drill round]]s (painted blue) for the purpose of training and display rounds (painted red) which could be loaded onto the launcher for port visits and public relations.  \n\n\n===Nuclear variant (not built)===\nIn addition, a [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear-armed]] variant was planned using a low-yield [[Nuclear fission#Fission bombs|fission]] warhead code-named ''Winkle''. ''Winkle'' was never built as it was quickly supplanted by ''Pixie'', a very small [[Nuclear weapon design|unboosted]] warhead with an all-plutonium fissile core [[British nuclear tests at Maralinga|tested]] at [[Maralinga, South Australia|Maralinga]], which was, in turn, replaced by ''Gwen'' \u2014 a British version of\nthe US [[W54]] ''Gnat'' unboosted warhead of approximate yield 1/2 - 2 [[Kiloton]] (kt). The final warhead choice was ''Tony'' - a UK version of the [[W44]] ''[[Tsetse primary|Tsetse]]'' [[Boosted fission weapon|boosted]] warhead, but all nuclear options for Seaslug were subsequently abandoned, and no nuclear-armed variant of Seaslug was ever deployed.\n\n==Operators==\n[[File:Sea Slug operators.png|thumb|400px|Map with Seaslug operators in blue]]\n\n===Royal Navy===\nThe County-class destroyers were specifically built to carry Seaslug and its associated control equipment. The magazine was positioned amidships and missiles were assembled in a central gallery forward of the magazine before being passed to the launcher on the quarterdeck. The handling arrangements were designed with a nuclear-war environment in mind and were therefore entirely under cover.\n\n===Chilean Navy===\nSome of the County-class destroyers were sold to Chile for the [[Chilean Navy]]. The system was decommissioned after the rebuild of the four ships purchased by Chile in the early 1990s.\n\n===Former operators===\n* {{flag|Chile}}: [[Chilean Navy]]\n* {{UK}}: [[Royal Navy]]\n\n==Media appearance==\nA Seaslug system appears in the 1970 ''[[UFO (TV series)|UFO]]'' TV series episode [[Destruction (UFO)|\"Destruction\"]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist-lr}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book\n|title= British Destroyers & Frigates: The Second World War & After\n|first= Norman |last=Friedman\n|publisher= Seaforth Publishing |date=2012\n|ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|title=The Royal Navy, 1930-2000: Innovation and Defence\n|editor1-first=Richard \n|editor1-last=Harding \n|isbn=0714657107\n|date= 2005\n|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=bw46M1qI9gM\n|ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n |title= Fire across the desert: Woomera and the Anglo-Australian Joint Project, 1946-1980\n |date=1989\n |publisher= Australian Govt.

It has two churches (Catholic and Reformatory), a village house, a shop for basic necessities, a slow food restaurant, a bus and two flocks of sheep.\n\n== Landscape and environment ==\nSzak\u00e1csi is centrally located in the Csereh\u00e1t, an area in the shape of a V, bounded by the rivers Hern\u00e1d and Bodva and the border with Slovakia. The landscape is reminiscent of the Dordogne or Tuscany: hills with forest and agricultural areas, sleepy villages and rural scenery. The villages are generously scattered over the Csereh\u00e1t with a mutual distance of 2 to 5 kilometres.\n\nThe Csereh\u00e1t is a poor area. Some employment in Szak\u00e1csi is provided by two farmers, some in forestry and recently by a company that converts empty houses into holiday homes.\nThe Csereh\u00e1t is the fruit garden of Hungary, with an abundance of apricots, peaches, plums, apples and cherries. Many people bring their fruit to the local distillery to make Palinka (sometimes more than 40% alcohol). The woods around Szak\u00e1csi are also known for the porcini, chanterelles, and trompes de la mort. The villagers say that even white truffle can be found ...\n\nAlong Szak\u00e1csi there are two long-distance footpaths, the red Csereh\u00e1t route and Orsz\u00e1gos Kekt\u00fara, the blue route, part of the European network of long-distance footpaths.<ref>[http://www.kektura.click.hu/keret.cgi?/frame002.htm Blue trail], with walking descriptions and photos.</ref>\n\n== Name ==\nSzak\u00e1csi means \"village of chefs.\" The history of Szak\u00e1csi goes back to 1300.

It has two churches (Catholic and Reformatory), a village house, a shop for basic necessities, a slow food restaurant, a bus and two flocks of sheep.\n\n== Landscape and environment ==\nSzak\u00e1csi is centrally located in the Csereh\u00e1t, an area in the shape of a V, bounded by the rivers Hern\u00e1d and Bodva and the border with Slovakia. The landscape is reminiscent of the Dordogne or Tuscany: hills with forest and agricultural areas, sleepy villages and rural scenery. The villages are generously scattered over the Csereh\u00e1t with a mutual distance of 2 to 5 kilometres. \n\nThe Csereh\u00e1t is a poor area. Some employment in Szak\u00e1csi is provided by two farmers, some in forestry and recently by a company that converts empty houses into holiday homes.\nThe Csereh\u00e1t is the fruit garden of Hungary, with an abundance of apricots, peaches, plums, apples and cherries. Many people bring their fruit to the local distillery to make Palinka (sometimes more than 40% alcohol). The woods around Szak\u00e1csi are also known for the porcini, chanterelles, and trompes de la mort. The villagers say that even white truffle can be found ...\n\nAlong Szak\u00e1csi there are two long-distance footpaths, the red Csereh\u00e1t route and Orsz\u00e1gos Kekt\u00fara, the blue route, part of the European network of long-distance footpaths.<ref>[http://www.kektura.click.hu/keret.cgi?/frame002.htm Blue trail], with walking descriptions and photos.</ref>\n\n== Name ==\nSzak\u00e1csi means \"village of chefs.\" The history of Szak\u00e1csi goes back to 1300. The inhabitants probably paid 'tax' by cooking for the king. Some say that the chef of the king lived here. It seems therefore logically that cooking pots and butcher choppers adorn the coat of arms of Szak\u00e1csi.<ref>[http://www.nemzetijelkepek.hu/onkormanyzat-szakacsi_en.shtml Coat of arms of Szak\u00e1csi], in historic context.</ref>\n\n==References==\n\n<references />\n1. \n\n{{Borsod-Aba\u00faj-Zempl\u00e9n County}}\n\n{{coord|48|23|N|20|52|E|display=title|region:HU_type:city_source:GNS-enwiki}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Szakacsi}}\n[[Category:Populated places in Borsod-Aba\u00faj-Zempl\u00e9n County]]\n\n\n{{Borsod-geo-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szak%C3%A1csi"}
