The name Chagford is derived from the word ''chag'', meaning [[gorse]] or broom, and the ''[[Ford (crossing)|ford]]'' suffix indicates its importance as a crossing place on the [[River Teign]].

Two large hardware stores side by side in the town square were run by the same two families for over a century, but one of these closed in 2017. It is also known for its arts community, celebrated through Chagfilm (the autumn Chagford Film Festival), Chagword (the springtime literary festival, every two years), Chagstock (the summer music festival), Wonderworks (the annual crafts weekend) and other regular cultural events. There are several tea rooms and whole food caf\u00e9s, one Bangladeshi restaurant, and four pubs. There are numerous guest houses and hotels in the surrounding countryside. These provide accommodation for the large influx of visitors during the year.\n\nThe early 20th century [[Edwin Lutyens]] house [[Castle Drogo]] lies nearby in [[Drewsteignton]] parish, and overlooks Chagford.\n\n==Governance==\nThe town has a Parish Council.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.chagford-parish.co.uk/ |title=Welcome to Chagford |work=chagford-parish.co.uk |accessdate=4 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1976 Chagford was twinned with [[Bretteville-sur-Laize]], France. Regular twinning activity was sustained for over 20 years, but lapsed. Chagford retains its \"Bretteville Close\", and Bretteville its \"Rue de Chagford\".\n\n==Landmarks==\nA 16th century building called Endecott House, on the edge of the town square, was given this name in the early 1990s in acknowledgment of a 17th-century governor of [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]], [[John Endecott]], who is thought to have been born in or near Chagford. This building was possibly built as a \"church house\", and has certainly been in community use for many years, including use as a village school. It now serves as a meeting hall.\n\nOne of the social centres of Chagford is the [[village hall]], the Jubilee Hall, in the south-east corner of the town next to the public car park.  Built in 1936 by public subscription, it was significantly extended between 2016 and 2018 and also houses the library (which opens three part-days a week) and a local history resource centre. It provides a venue for the regular Friday morning [[flea market]]s as well as other activities such as [[badminton]], [[table tennis]], parties, [[disco]]s, comedy nights, [[kung fu]], [[Pilates]], etc.\n\n[[The Three Crowns Hotel]] dates to the 13th century and is reportedly haunted by the ghost of the cavalier poet, [[Sidney Godolphin (poet)|Sidney Godolphin]], who was fatally wounded there in the [[English Civil War]].\n\nEaston Court is the hotel in which [[Evelyn Waugh]]  wrote [[Brideshead Revisited]], the last line of which reads ''Chagford, February\u2013June, 1944''.{{cn|date=September 2016}}\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Chagford Church.jpg|thumb|left|[[St Michael the Archangel's Church, Chagford|The church of St Michael the Archangel]]]]\nThe Anglican [[parish church]] of St [[Michael (archangel)|Michael the Archangel]] was dedicated in 1261 (originally a Catholic church), although little remains from this period. The tower dates back to the 15th century. The [[listed building|Grade I listed building]] was restored in 1865 and extended during the 20th century. It features carved [[Boss (architecture)|roof bosses]], similar to those found at St. Pancras' church, [[Widecombe-in-the-Moor]], including the tin miners\u2019 emblem of [[three hares]].\n\nChagford forms part of a \"united benefice\" of seven ecclesiastical parishes, known as The Whiddon Parishes of Dartmoor, the others being [[Throwleigh]], [[Gidleigh]], [[Drewsteignton]], [[Spreyton]], [[Hittisleigh]] and [[South Tawton]].\n\nA [[Methodism|Wesleyan]] Chapel (est. 1834) was replaced by a Methodist church built in 1861; it closed in the 1990s and is now in secular use. [[Victorian era]] directories list a [[Baptist]] church (established 1829), but long since disappeared. However, the Bible Christian Chapel (est. 1844) continues to flourish as Chagford Gospel Church, and a purpose-built [[Roman Catholic]] church was founded in 1963.\n\n==The Legend of Mary Whiddon==\nSt Michael's church contains a memorial to Mary Whiddon, dated 11 October 1641, whose death is thought to have been one of the inspirations behind an episode in [[Richard Doddridge Blackmore|R.D. Blackmore]]\u2019s novel, ''[[Lorna Doone]]''. Although his novel is set on [[Exmoor]], the author may have been moved by a local legend about Mary who, it is claimed, was shot dead on her wedding day as she came out of church. The climax of Lorna Doone involves such a shooting, but in that case the heroine survives.\n\nWhether this actually happened is unclear. Mary's tomb records that she died \"a matron, yet a maid\" (\"a married woman, yet a virgin\"). On the other hand, \"maid\" is a common term in Devon for a \"girl\" and the inscription may just mean that Mary died young (\"although married, still just a girl\"). The church's Marriage and Burial registers for the Civil War period are lost, and the only contemporaneous record is Mary Whiddon's undated will. It mentions no husband, but as her maiden name is also thought to have been Whiddon (i.e. she married a cousin), it might have been written before her marriage.\n\nIn the 21st century, a tradition has developed whereby new brides at the church lay a bouquet of flowers on Mary's memorial. This ritual is aimed at bringing good luck in the forthcoming marriage.<ref>Codd, Daniel (2013). ''Paranormal Devon''. Amberley. p.76-77. {{ISBN|978-1848681668}}</ref>\n\nThe ghost of Mary Whiddon is said to haunt [[Whiddon, Chagford|Whiddon Park House]], 2 miles outside the town.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Dartmoor Legend of Mary Whiddon |url=http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/mary_whiddon.htm |publisher=Legendary Dartmoor |accessdate=22 July 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Sports==\nChagford's War Memorial Playing Fields were redeveloped in the late 1980s to provide a [[cricket]] ground to the south west of the town, overlooked by a modern clubhouse. In the winter, the ground provides two [[football (soccer)|football]] pitches for the football club. There are public tennis courts in the town, with an associated Tennis Club, and an open-air swimming pool. A popular local running race, the Two Hills race takes place in Chagford every May, a 5k race starting from the cricket club and going up and around Meldon and Nattadon Hills, which are to the North of Chagford.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|Chagford}}\n* [http://www.chagford-parish.co.uk Chagford parish web site]\n* [https://visitchagford.com Visit Chagford (destination site)]\n* [https://www.chagfilm.org Chagfilm (film festival)]\n* [https://www.chagword.co.uk Chagword (literary festival)]\n* [https://chagstock.info Chagstock (music festival)]\n* [https://www.wonderworkscontemporarycraft.com Wonderworks (contemporary craft fair)]\n* [http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/mary_whiddon.htm The Legend of Mary Whiddon]\n\n\n{{Devon}}\n{{Settlements of Dartmoor}}\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Market towns in Devon]]\n[[Category:Dartmoor]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2015}}\n{{Infobox UK place \n| static_image_name=        Chagford's famous ironmongery stores, Webbers and Bowdens.jpg\n| static_image_caption=     Chagford's ironmongery store, Bowden's, with Webber's (closed 2017) beyond.\n| country =                 England\n| official_name=            Chagford\n| coordinates = {{coord|50.6728|-3.8404|display=inline,title}}\n| area_total_sq_mi=         11.7\n| population_density=       {{convert|125.6|/sqmi|/km2|abbr=on}}\n| area_footnotes=           <ref>[http://genuki.cs.ncl.ac.uk/DEV/Chagford/ White's Devonshire Directory (1850)] Present day parish boundaries are essentially the same as the 1850 boundaries</ref>\n| population = 1,449\n| population_ref = ([[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 Census]])\n | civil_parish=             Chagford\n| shire_district=           [[West Devon]]      \n| shire_county=             [[Devon]]\n| region=                   South West England\n| london_distance=          {{convert|194|mi|km|sp=us}}\n| constituency_westminster= [[Central Devon (UK Parliament constituency)|Central Devon]]\n| post_town=                NEWTON ABBOT\n| postcode_area=            TQ\n| postcode_district =       TQ13\n| dial_code=                01647\n| os_grid_reference=        SX700876\n| website=                  http://www.chagford-parish.co.uk\n}}\n'''Chagford''' is a [[market town]]{{efn|Since before 1220 Chagford has had the right to hold a regular market,<ref name=GMF>{{cite web |url= http://www.history.ac.uk/cmh/gaz/devon.html#Cha |title=Devon \u2013 Chagford |work=Gazetteer of Markets and Fairs to 1516 |publisher=history.ac.uk |accessdate=4 January 2017}}</ref> making it a [[List of towns in England|market town]].

Two large hardware stores side-by-side in the town square were run by the same two families for over a century, but one of these closed in 2017. It is also known for its arts community, celebrated through Chagfilm (the autumn Chagford Film Festival), Chagword (the springtime literary festival, every two years), Chagstock (the summer music festival), Wonderworks (the annual crafts weekend) and other regular cultural events. There are several tea rooms and whole food caf\u00e9s, one Bangladeshi restaurant, and four pubs. There are numerous guest houses and hotels in the surrounding countryside. These provide accommodation for the large influx of visitors during the year.\n\nThe early 20th century [[Edwin Lutyens]] house [[Castle Drogo]] lies nearby in [[Drewsteignton]] parish, and overlooks Chagford.\n\n==Governance==\nThe town has a Parish Council.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.chagford-parish.co.uk/ |title=Welcome to Chagford |work=chagford-parish.co.uk |accessdate=4 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1976 Chagford was twinned with [[Bretteville-sur-Laize]], France. Regular twinning activity was sustained for over 20 years, but lapsed. Chagford retains its \"Bretteville Close\", and Bretteville its \"Rue de Chagford\".\n\n==Landmarks==\nA 16th century building called Endecott House, on the edge of the town square, was given this name in the early 1990s in acknowledgment of a 17th century governor of [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]], [[John Endecott]], who is thought to have been born in or near Chagford. This building was possibly built as a \"church house\", and has certainly been in community use for many years, including use as a village school. It now serves as a meeting hall.\n\nOne of the social centres of Chagford is the [[village hall]], the Jubilee Hall, in the south-east corner of the town next to the public car park.  Built in 1936 by public subscription, it was significantly extended between 2016 and 2018 and also houses the library (which opens three part-days a week) and a local history resource centre. It provides a venue for the regular Friday morning [[flea market]]s as well as other activities such as [[badminton]], [[table tennis]], parties, [[disco]]s, comedy nights, [[kung fu]], [[Pilates]], etc.\n\n[[The Three Crowns Hotel]] dates to the 13th century and is reportedly haunted by the ghost of the cavalier poet, [[Sidney Godolphin (poet)|Sidney Godolphin]], who was fatally wounded there in the [[English Civil War]].\n\nEaston Court is the hotel in which [[Evelyn Waugh]]  wrote [[Brideshead Revisited]], the last line of which reads ''Chagford, February\u2013June, 1944''.{{cn|date=September 2016}}\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Chagford Church.jpg|thumb|left|[[St Michael the Archangel's Church, Chagford|The church of St Michael the Archangel]]]]\nThe Anglican [[parish church]] of St [[Michael (archangel)|Michael the Archangel]] was dedicated in 1261 (originally a Catholic church), although little remains from this period. The tower dates back to the 15th century. The [[listed building|Grade I listed building]] was restored in 1865 and extended during the 20th century. It features carved [[Boss (architecture)|roof bosses]], similar to those found at St. Pancras' church, [[Widecombe-in-the-Moor]], including the tin miners\u2019 emblem of [[three hares]].\n\nChagford forms part of a \"united benefice\" of seven ecclesiastical parishes, known as The Whiddon Parishes of Dartmoor, the others being [[Throwleigh]], [[Gidleigh]], [[Drewsteignton]], [[Spreyton]], [[Hittisleigh]] and [[South Tawton]].\n\nA [[Methodism|Wesleyan]] Chapel (est. 1834) was replaced by a Methodist church built in 1861; it closed in the 1990s and is now in secular use. [[Victorian era]] directories list a [[Baptist]] church (established 1829), but long since disappeared. However, the Bible Christian Chapel (est. 1844) continues to flourish as Chagford Gospel Church, and a purpose-built [[Roman Catholic]] church was founded in 1963.\n\n==The Legend of Mary Whiddon==\nSt Michael's church contains a memorial to Mary Whiddon, dated 11 October 1641, whose death is thought to have been one of the inspirations behind an episode in [[Richard Doddridge Blackmore|R.D. Blackmore]]\u2019s novel, ''[[Lorna Doone]]''. Although his novel is set on [[Exmoor]], the author may have been moved by a local legend about Mary who, it is claimed, was shot dead on her wedding day as she came out of church. The climax of Lorna Doone involves such a shooting, but in that case the heroine survives.\n\nWhether this actually happened is unclear. Mary's tomb records that she died \"a matron, yet a maid\" (\"a married woman, yet a virgin\"). On the other hand, \"maid\" is a common term in Devon for a \"girl\" and the inscription may just mean that Mary died young (\"although married, still just a girl\"). The church's Marriage and Burial registers for the Civil War period are lost, and the only contemporaneous record is Mary Whiddon's undated will. It mentions no husband, but as her maiden name is also thought to have been Whiddon (i.e. she married a cousin), it might have been written before her marriage.\n\nIn the 21st century, a tradition has developed whereby new brides at the church lay a bouquet of flowers on Mary's memorial. This ritual is aimed at bringing good luck in the forthcoming marriage.<ref>Codd, Daniel (2013). ''Paranormal Devon''. Amberley. p.76-77. {{ISBN|978-1848681668}}</ref>\n\nThe ghost of Mary Whiddon is said to haunt [[Whiddon, Chagford|Whiddon Park House]], 2 miles outside the town.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Dartmoor Legend of Mary Whiddon |url=http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/mary_whiddon.htm |publisher=Legendary Dartmoor |accessdate=22 July 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Sports==\nChagford's War Memorial Playing Fields were redeveloped in the late 1980s to provide a [[cricket]] ground to the south west of the town, overlooked by a modern clubhouse. In the winter, the ground provides two [[football (soccer)|football]] pitches for the football club. There are public tennis courts in the town, with an associated Tennis Club, and an open-air swimming pool. A popular local running race, the Two Hills race takes place in Chagford every May, a 5k race starting from the cricket club and going up and around Meldon and Nattadon Hills, which are to the North of Chagford.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|Chagford}}\n* [http://www.chagford-parish.co.uk Chagford parish web site]\n* [https://visitchagford.com Visit Chagford (destination site)]\n* [https://www.chagfilm.org Chagfilm (film festival)]\n* [https://www.chagword.co.uk Chagword (literary festival)]\n* [https://chagstock.info Chagstock (music festival)]\n* [https://www.wonderworkscontemporarycraft.com Wonderworks (contemporary craft fair)]\n* [http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/mary_whiddon.htm The Legend of Mary Whiddon]\n\n\n{{Devon}}\n{{Settlements of Dartmoor}}\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Market towns in Devon]]\n[[Category:Dartmoor]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: side-by-side \u2192 side by side, a 17th century \u2192 a 17th-century", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chagford"}

Others argue{{who|date=August 2016}} that gambling is a type of [[regressive tax]] on the individuals in local economies where gambling venues are located.\n\n==Gambling revenues==\nAccording to the Center for Gaming Research University Libraries, legal gambling revenues for 2017 were as follows:<ref name=\"revenue\"/>\n* Commercial casinos: $41.2 billion\n*[[Native American gaming|Tribal casinos]]: $31.945 billion\n*[[Cardroom|Card rooms]]: $1.9 billion\n* Lotteries: $80.55 billion\n* Legal bookmaking: $248 million\n* [[Parimutuel betting|Pari-mutuel wagering]]: $295 million\n* Charitable games and bingo: $2.15 billion\n\nGrand total: $158.54 billion\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of gambling in the United States}}\n\n==Authorized types==\nMany levels of government have authorized multiple forms of gambling in an effort to raise money for needed services without raising direct taxes. These include everything from bingo games in church basements, to multimillion-dollar poker tournaments. Sometimes states advertise revenues from certain games to be devoted to particular needs, such as education.\n\nWhen New Hampshire authorized a state lottery in 1963, it represented a major shift in social policy. No state governments had previously directly run gambling operations to raise money. Other states followed suit, and now the majority of the states run some type of lottery to raise funds for state operations.  Some states restrict this revenue to specific forms of expenditures, usually oriented toward education, while others allow lottery revenues to be spent on general government.   This has brought about morally questionable issues, such as states' using marketing firms to increase their market share, or to develop new programs when old forms of gambling do not raise as much money.\n\nThe [[American Gaming Association]] breaks gambling down into the following categories:<ref name=\"revenue\"/>\n* [[Poker|Card Rooms]], both public and private\n* [[Casino|Commercial casinos]]\n* [[Charity gambling|Charitable games]] and [[Bingo (American version)|Bingo]]\n* [[Native American gaming|Tribal casinos]]\n* [[Sports betting|Legal bookmaking]]\n* [[Lottery|Lotteries]]\n* [[Parimutuel betting|Parimutuel wagering]]\n* [[Advance-deposit wagering]]\n\n==Legal issues==\nGambling is legal under U.S. federal law, although there are significant restrictions pertaining to interstate and online gambling. Each state is free to regulate or prohibit the practice within its borders. [[Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992]] effectively outlawed sports betting nationwide, excluding a few states. However, On May 14, 2018 the [[United States Supreme Court]] declared the entire law unconstitutional ([[Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association]]).\n\nIf state-run lotteries are included, almost every state can be said to allow some form of gambling. Only two states completely outlaw all forms of gambling, [[Hawaii]] and [[Utah]]. However, casino-style gambling is much less widespread. Federal law provides leeway for Native American Trust Land to be used for games of chance if an agreement is put in place between the State and the Tribal Government (e.g. A 'Compact' or 'Agreement')  under the [[Indian Gaming Regulatory Act]] of 1988.\n\n[[Nevada]] and [[Louisiana]] are the only two states in which casino-style gambling is legal statewide. Both state and local governments impose licensing and zoning restrictions. All other states that allow casino-style gambling restrict it to small geographic areas{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} (e.g., [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]] or [[Tunica, Mississippi]]), or to [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] [[Indian reservation|reservations]], some of which are located in or near large cities. As domestic dependent nations, American Indian tribes have used legal protection to open casinos, which has been a contentious political issue in [[California]] and other states. In some states, casinos are restricted to \"[[Riverboat casino|riverboats]]\", large multi-story barges that are, more often than not, permanently moored in a body of water.\n\n[[Online gambling]] has been more strictly regulated. The [[Federal Wire Act]] of 1961 outlawed interstate wagering on sports, but did not address other forms of gambling. It has been the subject of court cases. The [[Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006]] (UIGEA) did not specifically prohibit online gambling; instead, it outlawed financial transactions involving online gambling service providers. Some offshore gambling providers reacted by shutting down their services for US customers. Other operators, however, have continued to circumvent UIGEA and have continued to service US customers. For this reason, UIGEA has received criticism from notable figures within the gambling industry.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thepogg.com/thepogg-interviews-michael-shackleford-the-wizard-of-odds/ |title=ThePOGG Interviews \u2013 Michael Shackleford \u2013 The Wizard of Odds |date=1 November 2012  |author=ThePOGG }}</ref>\n\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+ Type of Legal Gambling in States and Territories (commercial, Indian, racetrack casinos, etc.)\n|-\n!\tState/district/territory\t!!

''The Praeger Handbook on Contemporary Issues in Native America'', Westport, CT: Praeger Publishers, 2007.</ref>  Prior to this, the native Americans had no previous experience with large-scale commercial gambling. Native Americans were familiar with the concept of small-scale gambling, such as placing bets on sporting contests. For example, the Iroquois, Ojibways, and Menominees would place bets on games of snow snake.<ref name=\"Praeger\"/> Within six years after commercial gambling among native Americans developed, seventy-five to eighty of the three hundred federally recognized tribes became involved. By 2006, about three hundred native American groups hosted some sort of gaming.<ref name=\"Praeger\"/>\n\nSome native American tribes operate casinos on tribal land to provide employment and revenue for their government and their tribe members. Tribal gaming is regulated on the tribal, state, and federal level. Native American tribes are required to use gambling revenue to provide for governmental operations, economic development, and the welfare of their members. Federal regulation of native American gaming was established under the [[Indian Gaming Regulatory Act]] of 1988. Under the provisions of that law, games are divided into three distinct categories:\n* Class I games are \"traditional\" games that involve little or no wagering.\n* Class II games include bingo, [[pull-tab]]s, and certain non-banked card games ([[poker]], [[cribbage]], [[contract bridge]], [[whist]], etc.).\n* Class III games include all casino games ([[craps]], [[roulette]], [[blackjack]], [[Baccarat (card game)|baccarat]], [[slot machine]]s, and other games where the player bets against the house) and games that do not properly fall into classes I or II.<ref name=\"tribal\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.indiangaming.org/library/indian-gaming-facts/ |title=Indian Gaming Facts |access-date=2006-04-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061105120523/http://www.indiangaming.org/library/indian-gaming-facts/ |archive-date=2006-11-05 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\nOf the 562 federally recognized tribes in 1988, 201 participated in class two or class III gaming by 2001.<ref name=\"Praeger\"/> Tribal gambling had revenues of $14.5 billion in 2002 from 354 casinos. Approximately forty percent of the 562 federally recognized tribes operate gaming establishments.<ref name=\"tribal\"/>\n\nLike other Americans, many indigenous Americans have dissension over the issue of casino gambling. Some tribes are too isolated geographically to make a casino successful, while some do not want non-native Americans on their land. Though casino gambling is controversial, it has proven economically successful for most tribes, and the [[impact of Native American gambling|impact of American Indian gambling]] has proven to be far-reaching.\n\nGaming creates many jobs, not only for native Americans, but also for non-native Americans, and in this way can positively affect relations with the non-native American community. On some reservations, the number of non-native American workers is larger than the number of Native American workers because of the scale of the casino resorts.<ref name=\"Political Issues\"/> Also, some tribes contribute a share of casino revenues to the state in which they are located, or to charitable and non-profit causes. For example, the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians of California gave 4 million dollars to the [[UCLA Law School]] to establish a center for American Indian Studies. The same tribe also gave $1 million to the state for disaster relief when the area was ravaged by wildfires in 2003.<ref name=\"Political Issues\"/>\n\nAlthough casinos have proven successful for both the tribes and the surrounding regions, state residents may oppose construction of native American casinos, especially if they have competing projects. For example, in November 2003, the state of [[Maine]] voted against a $650 million casino project proposed by the [[Penobscots]] and [[Passamaquoddy people|Passamaquoddies]]. The project's objective was to create jobs for the tribes' young people.  The same day the state voted against the Indian casino project, Maine voters approved a plan to add slot machines to the state's harness racing tracks.<ref name=\"Political Issues\"/>\n\nThe [[National Indian Gaming Commission]] oversees Native American gaming for the federal government. The National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) was established under the [[Indian Gaming Regulatory Act]] in 1988. Under the NIGC, Class I gaming is under the sole jurisdiction of the tribe. Class II gaming is governed by the tribe, but it is also subject to NIGC regulation. Class III gaming is under the jurisdiction of the states. For instance, in order for a tribe to build and operate a casino, the tribe must work and negotiate with the state in which it is located. These [[Tribal-State compacts]] determine how much revenue the states will obtain from the Indian casinos.<ref name=\"Political Issues\">Welch, Deborah. Contemporary Native American Issues: Political Issues. Chelsea House Publishers, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe Indian Gaming Regulatory Act requires that gaming revenues be used only for governmental or charitable purposes.<ref name=\"New Capitalists\">Darian-Smith, Eve. ''New Capitalists: Law, Politics, and Identity Surrounding Casino Gaming on Native American Land'', Wadsworth/Thomson Learning, 2004</ref> The tribal governments determine specifically how gaming revenues are spent.  Revenues have been used to build houses, schools, and roads; to fund health care and education; and to support community and economic development initiatives. Indian gaming is the first and essentially the only economic development tool available on Indian reservations. The National Gaming Impact Study Commission has stated that \"no...economic development other than gaming has been found\".<ref name=\"New Capitalists\"/> Tribal governments, though, use gaming revenues to develop other economic enterprises such as museums, malls, and cultural centers.\n\nThere are currently 30 states that have native American gaming: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.\n\n==Lotteries==\n{{Main|Lotteries in the United States}}\nThe classic lottery is a drawing in which each contestant buys a combination of numbers. Each combination of numbers, or \"play\", is usually priced at $1. Plays are usually non-exclusive, meaning that two or more ticket holders may buy the same combination. The lottery organization then draws the winning combination of 5-8 numbers, usually from 1 to 50, using a randomized, automatic ball tumbler machine.\n\nTo win, contestants match their combinations of numbers with the drawn combination. The combination may be in any order, except in some \"mega ball\" lotteries, where the \"mega\" number for the combination must match the ball designated as the \"mega ball\" in the winning combination. If there are multiple winners, they split the winnings, also known as the \"Jackpot\". Winnings are currently subject to federal income taxes as [[ordinary income]]. Winnings can be awarded as a yearly [[Annuity (US financial products)|annuity]] or as a [[present value|lump sum]], depending on lottery rules.\n\nMost states have state-sponsored and multi-state lotteries. There are only six states that do not sell lottery tickets: Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii, Mississippi, Nevada, and Utah. In some states, revenues from lotteries are designated for a specific budgetary purpose, such as education. Other states put lottery revenue into the general fund.\n\nMulti-jurisdictional lotteries generally have larger jackpots due to the greater number of tickets sold. The [[Mega Millions]] and [[Powerball]] games are the biggest of such lotteries in terms of numbers of participating states.\n\n===Scratchcard games===\nSome [[state lottery|state lotteries]] run games other than the lotteries. Usually, these are in the [[scratchcard]] format, although some states use [[pull-tab]] games. In either format, cards are sold that have opaque areas. In some games, all of the opaque material is removed to see if the contestant has won, and how much. In other scratchcard games, a contestant must pick which parts of a card to scratch, to match amounts or play another form of game.\nThese games are prone to forgeries both from card dealers (who can sell fake cards) and players (who can fake winning cards).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2006\\story_4-2-2006_pg7_27 |url-status=dead |title=Fake scratch cards causing quarrels and deaths |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514183037/http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2006%5C02%5C04%5Cstory_4-2-2006_pg7_27 |archive-date=May 14, 2006 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Recriminalization==\nOn July 1, 2000, a new law took effect in the [[U.S. state|state]] of [[South Carolina]], whereby the ownership, possession, or operation of a [[video poker]] machine, for either commercial or personal use, became illegal. Violators are subject to prosecution and substantial fines. Through at least 2007, the only type of legalized gambling in that state is the [[South Carolina Education Lottery]].<ref>[http://casinogambling.about.com/library/weekly/aa101899.htm About.com], accessed February 21, 2007</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading==\n* Abt, Vicki, James F.

Others argue{{who|date=August 2016}} that gambling is a type of [[regressive tax]] on the individuals in local economies where gambling venues are located.\n\n==Gambling revenues==\nAccording to the Center for Gaming Research University Libraries, legal gambling revenues for 2017 were as follows:<ref name=\"revenue\"/>\n* Commercial casinos: $41.2 billion\n* Tribal casinos: $31.945 billion\n* Card rooms: $1.9 billion\n* Lotteries: $80.55 billion\n* Legal bookmaking: $248 million\n* [[Parimutuel betting|Pari-mutuel wagering]]: $295 million\n* Charitable games and bingo: $2.15 billion\n\nGrand total: $158.54 billion\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of gambling in the United States}}\n\n==Authorized types==\nMany levels of government have authorized multiple forms of gambling in an effort to raise money for needed services without raising direct taxes. These include everything from bingo games in church basements, to multimillion-dollar poker tournaments. Sometimes states advertise revenues from certain games to be devoted to particular needs, such as education.\n\nWhen New Hampshire authorized a state lottery in 1963, it represented a major shift in social policy. No state governments had previously directly run gambling operations to raise money. Other states followed suit, and now the majority of the states run some type of lottery to raise funds for state operations.  Some states restrict this revenue to specific forms of expenditures, usually oriented toward education, while others allow lottery revenues to be spent on general government.   This has brought about morally questionable issues, such as states' using marketing firms to increase their market share, or to develop new programs when old forms of gambling do not raise as much money.\n\nThe [[American Gaming Association]] breaks gambling down into the following categories:<ref name=\"revenue\"/>\n* [[Poker|Card Rooms]], both public and private\n* [[Casino|Commercial casinos]]\n* [[Charity gambling|Charitable games]] and [[Bingo (American version)|Bingo]]\n* [[Native American gaming|Tribal casinos]]\n* [[Sports betting|Legal bookmaking]]\n* [[Lottery|Lotteries]]\n* [[Parimutuel betting|Parimutuel wagering]]\n* [[Advance-deposit wagering]]\n\n==Legal issues==\nGambling is legal under U.S. federal law, although there are significant restrictions pertaining to interstate and online gambling. Each state is free to regulate or prohibit the practice within its borders. [[Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992]] effectively outlawed sports betting nationwide, excluding a few states. However, On May 14, 2018 the [[United States Supreme Court]] declared the entire law unconstitutional ([[Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association]]).\n\nIf state-run lotteries are included, almost every state can be said to allow some form of gambling. Only two states completely outlaw all forms of gambling, [[Hawaii]] and [[Utah]]. However, casino-style gambling is much less widespread. Federal law provides leeway for Native American Trust Land to be used for games of chance if an agreement is put in place between the State and the Tribal Government (e.g. A 'Compact' or 'Agreement')  under the [[Indian Gaming Regulatory Act]] of 1988.\n\n[[Nevada]] and [[Louisiana]] are the only two states in which casino-style gambling is legal statewide. Both state and local governments impose licensing and zoning restrictions. All other states that allow casino-style gambling restrict it to small geographic areas{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} (e.g., [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]] or [[Tunica, Mississippi]]), or to [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] [[Indian reservation|reservations]], some of which are located in or near large cities. As domestic dependent nations, American Indian tribes have used legal protection to open casinos, which has been a contentious political issue in [[California]] and other states. In some states, casinos are restricted to \"[[Riverboat casino|riverboats]]\", large multi-story barges that are, more often than not, permanently moored in a body of water.\n\n[[Online gambling]] has been more strictly regulated. The [[Federal Wire Act]] of 1961 outlawed interstate wagering on sports, but did not address other forms of gambling. It has been the subject of court cases. The [[Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006]] (UIGEA) did not specifically prohibit online gambling; instead, it outlawed financial transactions involving online gambling service providers. Some offshore gambling providers reacted by shutting down their services for US customers. Other operators, however, have continued to circumvent UIGEA and have continued to service US customers. For this reason, UIGEA has received criticism from notable figures within the gambling industry.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thepogg.com/thepogg-interviews-michael-shackleford-the-wizard-of-odds/ |title=ThePOGG Interviews \u2013 Michael Shackleford \u2013 The Wizard of Odds |date=1 November 2012  |author=ThePOGG }}</ref>\n\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+ Type of Legal Gambling in States and Territories (commercial, Indian, racetrack casinos, etc.)\n|-\n!\tState/district/territory\t!!

''The Praeger Handbook on Contemporary Issues in Native America'', Westport, CT: Praeger Publishers, 2007.</ref>  Prior to this, the native Americans had no previous experience with large-scale commercial gambling. Native Americans were familiar with the concept of small-scale gambling, such as placing bets on sporting contests. For example, the Iroquois, Ojibways, and Menominees would place bets on games of snow snake.<ref name=\"Praeger\"/> Within six years after commercial gambling among native Americans developed, seventy-five to eighty of the three hundred federally recognized tribes became involved. By 2006, about three hundred native American groups hosted some sort of gaming.<ref name=\"Praeger\"/>\n\nSome native American tribes operate casinos on tribal land to provide employment and revenue for their government and their tribe members. Tribal gaming is regulated on the tribal, state, and federal level. Native American tribes are required to use gambling revenue to provide for governmental operations, economic development, and the welfare of their members. Federal regulation of native American gaming was established under the [[Indian Gaming Regulatory Act]] of 1988. Under the provisions of that law, games are divided into three distinct categories:\n* Class I games are \"traditional\" games that involve little or no wagering.\n* Class II games include bingo, [[pull-tab]]s, and certain non-banked card games ([[poker]], [[cribbage]], [[contract bridge]], [[whist]], etc.).\n* Class III games include all casino games ([[craps]], [[roulette]], [[blackjack]], [[Baccarat (card game)|baccarat]], [[slot machine]]s, and other games where the player bets against the house) and games that do not properly fall into classes I or II.<ref name=\"tribal\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.indiangaming.org/library/indian-gaming-facts/ |title=Indian Gaming Facts |access-date=2006-04-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061105120523/http://www.indiangaming.org/library/indian-gaming-facts/ |archive-date=2006-11-05 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\nOf the 562 federally recognized tribes in 1988, 201 participated in class two or class III gaming by 2001.<ref name=\"Praeger\"/> Tribal gambling had revenues of $14.5 billion in 2002 from 354 casinos. Approximately forty percent of the 562 federally recognized tribes operate gaming establishments.<ref name=\"tribal\"/>\n\nLike other Americans, many indigenous Americans have dissension over the issue of casino gambling. Some tribes are too isolated geographically to make a casino successful, while some do not want non-native Americans on their land. Though casino gambling is controversial, it has proven economically successful for most tribes, and the [[impact of Native American gambling|impact of American Indian gambling]] has proven to be far-reaching.\n\nGaming creates many jobs, not only for native Americans, but also for non-native Americans, and in this way can positively affect relations with the non-native American community. On some reservations, the number of non-native American workers is larger than the number of Native American workers because of the scale of the casino resorts.<ref name=\"Political Issues\"/> Also, some tribes contribute a share of casino revenues to the state in which they are located, or to charitable and non-profit causes. For example, the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians of California gave 4 million dollars to the [[UCLA Law School]] to establish a center for American Indian Studies. The same tribe also gave $1 million to the state for disaster relief when the area was ravaged by wildfires in 2003.<ref name=\"Political Issues\"/>\n\nAlthough casinos have proven successful for both the tribes and the surrounding regions, state residents may oppose construction of native American casinos, especially if they have competing projects. For example, in November 2003, the state of [[Maine]] voted against a $650 million casino project proposed by the [[Penobscots]] and [[Passamaquoddy people|Passamaquoddies]]. The project's objective was to create jobs for the tribes' young people.  The same day the state voted against the Indian casino project, Maine voters approved a plan to add slot machines to the state's harness racing tracks.<ref name=\"Political Issues\"/>\n\nThe [[National Indian Gaming Commission]] oversees Native American gaming for the federal government. The National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) was established under the [[Indian Gaming Regulatory Act]] in 1988. Under the NIGC, Class I gaming is under the sole jurisdiction of the tribe. Class II gaming is governed by the tribe, but it is also subject to NIGC regulation. Class III gaming is under the jurisdiction of the states. For instance, in order for a tribe to build and operate a casino, the tribe must work and negotiate with the state in which it is located. These [[Tribal-State compacts]] determine how much revenue the states will obtain from the Indian casinos.<ref name=\"Political Issues\">Welch, Deborah. Contemporary Native American Issues: Political Issues. Chelsea House Publishers, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe Indian Gaming Regulatory Act requires that gaming revenues be used only for governmental or charitable purposes.<ref name=\"New Capitalists\">Darian-Smith, Eve. ''New Capitalists: Law, Politics, and Identity Surrounding Casino Gaming on Native American Land'', Wadsworth/Thomson Learning, 2004</ref> The tribal governments determine specifically how gaming revenues are spent.  Revenues have been used to build houses, schools, and roads; to fund health care and education; and to support community and economic development initiatives. Indian gaming is the first and essentially the only economic development tool available on Indian reservations. The National Gaming Impact Study Commission has stated that \"no...economic development other than gaming has been found\".<ref name=\"New Capitalists\"/> Tribal governments, though, use gaming revenues to develop other economic enterprises such as museums, malls, and cultural centers.\n\nThere are currently 30 states that have native American gaming: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.\n\n==Lotteries==\n{{Main|Lotteries in the United States}}\nThe classic lottery is a drawing in which each contestant buys a combination of numbers. Each combination of numbers, or \"play\", is usually priced at $1. Plays are usually non-exclusive, meaning that two or more ticket holders may buy the same combination. The lottery organization then draws the winning combination of 5-8 numbers, usually from 1 to 50, using a randomized, automatic ball tumbler machine.\n\nTo win, contestants match their combinations of numbers with the drawn combination. The combination may be in any order, except in some \"mega ball\" lotteries, where the \"mega\" number for the combination must match the ball designated as the \"mega ball\" in the winning combination. If there are multiple winners, they split the winnings, also known as the \"Jackpot\". Winnings are currently subject to federal income taxes as [[ordinary income]]. Winnings can be awarded as a yearly [[Annuity (US financial products)|annuity]] or as a [[present value|lump sum]], depending on lottery rules.\n\nMost states have state-sponsored and multi-state lotteries. There are only six states that do not sell lottery tickets: Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii, Mississippi, Nevada, and Utah. In some states, revenues from lotteries are designated for a specific budgetary purpose, such as education. Other states put lottery revenue into the general fund.\n\nMulti-jurisdictional lotteries generally have larger jackpots due to the greater number of tickets sold. The [[Mega Millions]] and [[Powerball]] games are the biggest of such lotteries in terms of numbers of participating states.\n\n===Scratchcard games===\nSome [[state lottery|state lotteries]] run games other than the lotteries. Usually, these are in the [[scratchcard]] format, although some states use [[pull-tab]] games. In either format, cards are sold that have opaque areas. In some games, all of the opaque material is removed to see if the contestant has won, and how much. In other scratchcard games, a contestant must pick which parts of a card to scratch, to match amounts or play another form of game.\nThese games are prone to forgeries both from card dealers (who can sell fake cards) and players (who can fake winning cards).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2006\\story_4-2-2006_pg7_27 |url-status=dead |title=Fake scratch cards causing quarrels and deaths |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514183037/http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2006%5C02%5C04%5Cstory_4-2-2006_pg7_27 |archive-date=May 14, 2006 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Recriminalization==\nOn July 1, 2000, a new law took effect in the [[U.S. state|state]] of [[South Carolina]], whereby the ownership, possession, or operation of a [[video poker]] machine, for either commercial or personal use, became illegal. Violators are subject to prosecution and substantial fines. Through at least 2007, the only type of legalized gambling in that state is the [[South Carolina Education Lottery]].<ref>[http://casinogambling.about.com/library/weekly/aa101899.htm About.com], accessed February 21, 2007</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading==\n* Abt, Vicki, James F.

Examples of what would cause a child to be placed in orphanages are when the parents were deceased, the biological family was abusive to the child, there was substance abuse or mental illness in the biological home that was detrimental to the child, or the parents had to leave to work elsewhere and were unable or unwilling to take the child. The role of legal responsibility for the support of children whose parent(s) have died or are otherwise unable to provide care differs internationally.\n\nThe use of government-run orphanages has been phased out in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and in the European Union member-states during the latter half of the 20th century but continue to operate in many other regions internationally. While the term \"orphanage\" is no longer typically used in the United States, nearly every US state continues to operate residential group homes for children in need of a safe place to live and in which to be supported in their educational and life-skills pursuits. Homes like the [[Milton Hershey School]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mhskids.org/|title=Milton Hershey School Website|date=21 July 2018|website=|access-date=}}</ref> in [[Pennsylvania]], Mooseheart<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mooseheart.org/|title=Mooseheart|website=www.mooseheart.org}}</ref> in [[Illinois]] and the Crossnore School and Children's Home<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.crossnore.org/|title=Crossnore School & Children's Home - Foster Care - Clinical Services|website=Crossnore}}</ref> in [[North Carolina]] continue to provide care and support for children in need. While a place like the Milton Hershey School houses nearly 2,000 children, each child lives in a small group-home environment with \"house parents\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mhskids.org/careers/careers-houseparent/|title=Careers as Houseparents - Milton Hershey School|publisher=}}</ref> who often live many years in that home. Children who grow up in these residential homes have higher rates of high school and college graduation than those who spend equivalent numbers of years in the US Foster Care system, wherein only 44 to 66 percent of children graduate from high school.<ref>Conger, D.

In countries where orphanages are no longer in use, the long-term care of unwarded children by the state has been transitioned to a domestic environment, with an emphasis on replicating a family home. Many of these countries, such as the United States, utilize a system of monetary stipends paid to foster parents to incentivize and subsidize the care of state wards in private homes. A distinction must be made between foster care and adoption, as adoption would remove the child from the care of the state and transfer the legal responsibility for that child's care to the adoptive parent completely and irrevocably, whereas in the case of foster care, the child would remain a ward of the state with the foster parent acting only as caregiver.\n\nMost children who live in orphanages are not [[orphan]]s; four out of five children in orphanages have at least one living parent and most having some extended family.<ref>{{Cite report|author=Corinna Cs\u00e1ky|date=2009|title=Keeping Children Out of Harmful Institutions|url=http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/sites/default/files/docs/Keeping_Children_Out_of_Harmful_Institutions_Final_20.11.09_1.pdf|access-date=1 January 2019|publisher=Save the Children|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229215955/http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/sites/default/files/docs/Keeping_Children_Out_of_Harmful_Institutions_Final_20.11.09_1.pdf|archive-date=29 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Developing countries and their governments rely on kinship care to aid in the orphan crisis, because it is cheaper to financially help extended families in taking in an orphaned child than it is to institutionalize them.<ref>{{Cite journal|journal=Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development|volume=76|issue=4|pages=163\u2013189|language=en|jstor = 41408761|last1 = Groza|first1 = Victor K.|title=Vii.

Furthermore, orphans in developing nations are seen as a problem that needs to be solved, this also makes them vulnerable to exploitation or neglect. In Pakistan, alternative care for orphans often falls on to extended families and Pakistan society as the government feels puts the burden of caring for orphans on them. Although it is very common for Pakistan citizens to take in orphans because of their culture and religion, only orphans whose parents have died are taken in. This neglects a population of children who need alternative care, either due to abuse, or parents who are unable to care for their child because of poverty, mental, or physical issues.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fkn.org.il/webfiles/fck/files/Middle-East-and-Asia_Perspectives-ebook.pdf#page=151|website=www.fkn.org.il|access-date=2018-12-15}}</ref>\n\nA few large international charities continue to fund orphanages, but most are still commonly founded by smaller charities and religious groups.<ref name=\"spectator1\" /> Especially in [[developing countries]], orphanages may prey on vulnerable families at risk of breakdown and actively recruit children to ensure continued funding.

Plato (''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'', 927) says: \"Orphans should be placed under the care of public guardians. Men should have a fear of the loneliness of orphans and of the souls of their departed parents. A man should love the unfortunate orphan of whom he is guardian as if he were his own child. He should be as careful and as diligent in the management of the orphan's property as of his own or even more careful still.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11322b.htm| title=The Catholic Encyclopedia, Volume XI}}</ref> The care of orphans was referred to bishops and, during the [[Middle Ages]], to [[monastery|monasteries]].

At sixteen, girls were generally [[apprenticeship|apprenticed]] as [[maid|servants]] for four years; at fourteen, boys were apprenticed into variety of occupations, typically for seven years. There was a small benevolent fund for adults.\n\nIn 1756, the [[House of Commons of Great Britain|House of Commons]] resolved that all children offered should be received, that local receiving places should be appointed all over the country, and that the funds should be publicly guaranteed. A basket was accordingly hung outside the hospital; the maximum age for admission was raised from two months to twelve, and a flood of children poured in from [[Poor Law|country workhouses]]. Parliament soon came to the conclusion that the indiscriminate admission should be discontinued. The hospital adopted a system of receiving children only with considerable sums. This practice was finally stopped in 1801; and it henceforth became a fundamental rule that no money was to be received.<ref>{{cite book|author=Oliver, Christine and Peter Aggleton|title=Coram's Children: Growing Up in the Care of the Foundling Hospital: 1900-1955|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0953661318|publisher=Coram Family|year=2000|isbn=978-0-9536613-1-2}}</ref>\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Children at crumpsall workhouse circa 1895.jpg|right|thumb|A group of orphans at Crumpsall Workhouse in the 19th century]]\nBy the early nineteenth century, the problem of abandoned children in urban areas, especially [[London]], began to reach alarming proportions. The [[workhouse]] system, instituted in [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834|1834]], although often brutal, was an attempt at the time to house orphans as well as other vulnerable people in society who could not support themselves in exchange for work.\nConditions, especially for the women and children, were so bad as to cause an outcry among the [[social reform]]-minded [[middle-class]]; some of [[Charles Dickens]]' most famous novels, including ''[[Oliver Twist]]'', highlighted the plight of the vulnerable and the often abusive conditions that were prevalent in the London orphanages.\n\nClamour for change led to the birth of the orphanage movement. In England, the movement really took off in the mid-19th century although orphanages such as the Orphan Working Home in 1758 and the Bristol Asylum for Poor Orphan Girls in 1795, had been set up earlier. Private orphanages were founded by private benefactors; these often received [[patronage|royal patronage]] and government oversight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://histclo.com/insti/Orp/orp-eng.html|title=English Orphanages}}</ref> \n[[Ragged school]]s, founded by [[John Pounds]] and the [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]] were also set up to provide pauper children with basic education.\n\nOrphanages were also set up in the United States from the early 19th century; for example, in 1806, the first private orphanage in New York (the Orphan Asylum Society, now [[Graham Windham]]) was co-founded by [[Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton]], widow of [[Alexander Hamilton]], one of the [[founding fathers of the United States]].<ref name=segedin>{{cite journal |title=''Hamilton'' Boosts Orphanage's Story, History |first=Andy |last=Segedin |date=17 May 2016 |journal=The NonProfit Times |url=http://www.thenonprofittimes.com/news-articles/hamilton-boosts-orphanages-story-history/ |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161127025327/http://www.thenonprofittimes.com/news-articles/hamilton-boosts-orphanages-story-history/ |archivedate=2016-11-27 }}</ref> Under the influence of [[Charles Loring Brace]], [[foster care]] became a popular alternative from the mid-19th century.<ref>{{cite book|title=America Past and Present Online-Charles Loring Brace, The Life of The Street Rats|year=1872|url=http://occawlonline.pearsoned.com/bookbind/pubbooks/nash5e_awl/medialib/timeline/docs/sources/theme_primarysources_Labor_3.html|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527091631/http://occawlonline.pearsoned.com/bookbind/pubbooks/nash5e_awl/medialib/timeline/docs/sources/theme_primarysources_Labor_3.html|archivedate=27 May 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Later, the [[Social Security Act of 1935#History|Social Security Act of 1935]] improved conditions by authorizing [[Aid to Families with Dependent Children]] as a form of [[social security]].\n\n[[File:Drbarnardo.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Thomas John Barnardo]], the founder of the [[Barnardos|Barnardos Home]] for orphaned children.]]\nA very influential philanthropist of the era was [[Thomas John Barnardo]], the founder of the charity [[Barnardos]].

Deinstitutionalization of orphanages and children's homes program in the United States began in the 1950s, after a series of scandals involving the coercion of birth parents and abuse of orphans (notably at [[Georgia Tann]]'s [[Tennessee Children's Home Society]]). In Romania, a [[Decree 770|decree]] was established that aggressively promoted population growth, banning contraception and abortions for women with fewer than four children, despite the wretched poverty of most families.

Often protecting the children from trafficking/abuse is cited but the names and photographs of the children are published in marketing material to attract more funding.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oonsx28vcKk  |title=IHF Promotional Video - youtube }}</ref> The reality is that the safest environment for these children is almost always with their parents or in their villages with familial connections where strangers are rarely seen and immediately recognized. A very few of these orphanages, go so far as to abduct or forcibly remove children from their homes, often across the border in Myanmar. The parents in local hill tribes may be encouraged to \"buy a place\" in the orphanage for vast sums, being told their child will have a better future.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2418074/Fake-orphanages-Bogus-animal-sanctuaries-And-crooks-growing-rich-Western-gullibility--gooding-gap-year-holidays-horrifyingly-callous-con.html?ico=femail |title=Fake Orphanages - Dail Mail UK | location=London | work=Daily Mail |first=Chloe |last=Lambert |date=11 September 2013}}</ref> Some children's homes claim to always try to repatriate children with their families, but the local managers & director of the homes know of no such procedures or processes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ihfonline.org/annual_reports/IHF%20Annual%20Report%202010.pdf |title=CEO Annual Report - IHF }}</ref>\n\n==== South Korea ====\n\"There are now 17,000 children in public orphanages throughout the country and untold numbers at private institutions.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1999/mar/06/news/mn-14508 |title=S.

Examples of what would cause a child to be placed in orphanages are when the parents were deceased, the biological family was abusive to the child, there was substance abuse or mental illness in the biological home that was detrimental to the child, or the parents had to leave to work elsewhere and were unable or unwilling to take the child. The role of legal responsibility for the support of children whose parent(s) have died or are otherwise unable to provide care differs internationally.\n\nThe use of government-run orphanages has been phased out in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and in the European Union member-states during the latter half of the 20th century but continue to operate in many other regions internationally. While the term \"orphanage\" is no longer typically used in the United States, nearly every US state continues to operate residential group homes for children in need of a safe place to live and in which to be supported in their educational and life-skills pursuits. Homes like the [[Milton Hershey School]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mhskids.org/|title=Milton Hershey School Website|date=21 July 2018|website=|access-date=}}</ref> in [[Pennsylvania]], Mooseheart<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mooseheart.org/|title=Mooseheart|website=www.mooseheart.org}}</ref> in [[Illinois]] and the Crossnore School and Children's Home<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.crossnore.org/|title=Crossnore School & Children's Home - Foster Care - Clinical Services|website=Crossnore}}</ref> in [[North Carolina]] continue to provide care and support for children in need. While a place like the Milton Hershey School houses nearly 2,000 children, each child lives in a small group-home environment with \"house parents\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mhskids.org/careers/careers-houseparent/|title=Careers as Houseparents - Milton Hershey School|publisher=}}</ref> who often live many years in that home. Children who grow up in these residential homes have higher rates of high school and college graduation than those who spend equivalent numbers of years in the US Foster Care system, wherein only 44 to 66 percent of children graduate from high school.<ref>Conger, D.

In countries where orphanages are no longer in use, the long-term care of unwarded children by the state has been transitioned to a domestic environment, with an emphasis on replicating a family home. Many of these countries, such as the United States, utilize a system of monetary stipends paid to foster parents to incentivize and subsidize the care of state wards in private homes. A distinction must be made between foster care and adoption, as adoption would remove the child from the care of the state and transfer the legal responsibility for that child's care to the adoptive parent completely and irrevocably, whereas in the case of foster care, the child would remain a ward of the state with the foster parent acting only as caregiver.\n\nMost children who live in orphanages are not [[orphan]]s; four out of five children in orphanages have at least one living parent and most having some extended family.<ref>{{Cite report|author=Corinna Cs\u00e1ky|date=2009|title=Keeping Children Out of Harmful Institutions|url=http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/sites/default/files/docs/Keeping_Children_Out_of_Harmful_Institutions_Final_20.11.09_1.pdf|access-date=1 January 2019|publisher=Save the Children|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229215955/http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/sites/default/files/docs/Keeping_Children_Out_of_Harmful_Institutions_Final_20.11.09_1.pdf|archive-date=29 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Developing countries and their governments rely on kinship care to aid in the orphan crisis, because it is cheaper to financially help extended families in taking in an orphaned child than it is to institutionalize them.<ref>{{Cite journal|journal=Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development|volume=76|issue=4|pages=163\u2013189|language=en|jstor = 41408761|last1 = Groza|first1 = Victor K.|title=Vii.

Furthermore, orphans in developing nations are seen as a problem that needs to be solved, this also makes them vulnerable to exploitation or neglect. In Pakistan, alternative care for orphans often falls on to extended families and Pakistan society as the government feels puts the burden of caring for orphans on them. Although it is very common for Pakistan citizens to take in orphans because of their culture and religion, only orphans whose parents have died are taken in. This neglects a population of children who need alternative care, either due to abuse, or parents who are unable to care for their child because of poverty, mental, or physical issues.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fkn.org.il/webfiles/fck/files/Middle-East-and-Asia_Perspectives-ebook.pdf#page=151|website=www.fkn.org.il|access-date=2018-12-15}}</ref>\n\nA few large international charities continue to fund orphanages, but most are still commonly founded by smaller charities and religious groups.<ref name=\"spectator1\" /> Especially in [[developing countries]], orphanages may prey on vulnerable families at risk of breakdown and actively recruit children to ensure continued funding.

At sixteen, girls were generally [[apprenticeship|apprenticed]] as [[maid|servants]] for four years; at fourteen, boys were apprenticed into variety of occupations, typically for seven years. There was a small benevolent fund for adults.\n\nIn 1756, the [[House of Commons of Great Britain|House of Commons]] resolved that all children offered should be received, that local receiving places should be appointed all over the country, and that the funds should be publicly guaranteed. A basket was accordingly hung outside the hospital; the maximum age for admission was raised from two months to twelve, and a flood of children poured in from [[Poor Law|country workhouses]]. Parliament soon came to the conclusion that the indiscriminate admission should be discontinued. The hospital adopted a system of receiving children only with considerable sums. This practice was finally stopped in 1801; and it henceforth became a fundamental rule that no money was to be received.<ref>{{cite book|author=Oliver, Christine and Peter Aggleton|title=Coram's Children: Growing Up in the Care of the Foundling Hospital: 1900-1955|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0953661318|publisher=Coram Family|year=2000|isbn=978-0-9536613-1-2}}</ref>\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Children at crumpsall workhouse circa 1895.jpg|right|thumb|A group of orphans at Crumpsall Workhouse in the 19th century]]\nBy the early nineteenth century, the problem of abandoned children in urban areas, especially [[London]], began to reach alarming proportions. The [[workhouse]] system, instituted in [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834|1834]], although often brutal, was an attempt at the time to house orphans as well as other vulnerable people in society who could not support themselves in exchange for work.\nConditions, especially for the women and children, were so bad as to cause an outcry among the [[social reform]]-minded [[middle-class]]; some of [[Charles Dickens]]' most famous novels, including ''[[Oliver Twist]]'', highlighted the plight of the vulnerable and the often abusive conditions that were prevalent in the London orphanages.\n\nClamour for change led to the birth of the orphanage movement. In England, the movement really took off in the mid-19th century although orphanages such as the Orphan Working Home in 1758 and the Bristol Asylum for Poor Orphan Girls in 1795, had been set up earlier. Private orphanages were founded by private benefactors; these often received [[patronage|royal patronage]] and government oversight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://histclo.com/insti/Orp/orp-eng.html|title=English Orphanages}}</ref> \n[[Ragged school]]s, founded by [[John Pounds]] and the [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]] were also set up to provide pauper children with basic education.\n\nOrphanages were also set up in the United States from the early 19th century; for example, in 1806, the first private orphanage in New York (the Orphan Asylum Society, now [[Graham Windham]]) was co-founded by [[Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton]], widow of [[Alexander Hamilton]], one of the [[founding fathers of the United States]].<ref name=segedin>{{cite journal |title=''Hamilton'' Boosts Orphanage's Story, History |first=Andy |last=Segedin |date=17 May 2016 |journal=The NonProfit Times |url=http://www.thenonprofittimes.com/news-articles/hamilton-boosts-orphanages-story-history/ |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161127025327/http://www.thenonprofittimes.com/news-articles/hamilton-boosts-orphanages-story-history/ |archivedate=2016-11-27 }}</ref> Under the influence of [[Charles Loring Brace]], [[foster care]] became a popular alternative from the mid-19th century.<ref>{{cite book|title=America Past and Present Online-Charles Loring Brace, The Life of The Street Rats|year=1872|url=http://occawlonline.pearsoned.com/bookbind/pubbooks/nash5e_awl/medialib/timeline/docs/sources/theme_primarysources_Labor_3.html|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527091631/http://occawlonline.pearsoned.com/bookbind/pubbooks/nash5e_awl/medialib/timeline/docs/sources/theme_primarysources_Labor_3.html|archivedate=27 May 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Later, the [[Social Security Act of 1935#History|Social Security Act of 1935]] improved conditions by authorizing [[Aid to Families with Dependent Children]] as a form of [[social security]].\n\n[[File:Drbarnardo.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Thomas John Barnardo]], the founder of the [[Barnardos|Barnardos Home]] for orphaned children.]]\nA very influential philanthropist of the era was [[Thomas John Barnardo]], the founder of the charity [[Barnardos]].

By his death in 1905, he had established 112 district homes, which searched for and received waifs and strays, to feed, clothe and educate them.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} The system under which the institution was carried on is broadly as follows: the infants and younger girls and boys were chiefly \"boarded out\" in rural districts; girls above fourteen years of age were sent to the industrial training homes, to be taught useful domestic occupations; boys above seventeen years of age were first tested in labour homes and then placed in employment at home, sent to sea, or emigrated; boys of between thirteen and seventeen years of age were trained for the various trades for which they might be mentally or physically fitted{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n===Deinstitutionalization===\nEvidence from a variety of studies support the vital importance of attachment security and later development of children. Deinstitutionalization of orphanages and children's homes program in the United States began in the 1950s, after a series of scandals involving the coercion of birth parents and abuse of orphans (notably at [[Georgia Tann]]'s [[Tennessee Children's Home Society]]). In Romania, a [[Decree 770|decree]] was established that aggressively promoted population growth, banning contraception and abortions for women with fewer than four children, despite the wretched poverty of most families. After Ceausescu was overthrown, he left a society unable and unwilling to take care of its children. Researchers conducted a study to see  what the implications of this early childhood neglect were on development. Typically reared Romanian children showed high rates of secure attachment. Whereas the institutionally raised children showed huge rates of disorganized attachment.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dozier|first=Mary|date=2014-06-01|title=Romania's Abandoned Children: Deprivation, Brain Development, and the Struggle for Recovery|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=171|issue=6|pages=693\u2013694|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2014.14030320|issn=0002-953X}}</ref> Many countries accepted the need to de-institutionalize the care of vulnerable children\u2014that is, close down orphanages in favor of foster care and accelerated adoption.\n\nFoster care operates by taking in children from their homes due to the lack of care or abuse of their parents, where orphanages take in children with no parents or children whose parents have dropped them off for a better life, typically due to income.

While the 12-inch version included \"You & I, Part II\" from the ''[[Tango in the Night]]'' album, the 7-inch version included a non-album track, \"You & I, Part I\". A limited edition 12-inch picture disc was released in the UK, as well as a double 7-inch pack, which contained the \"Big Love\" single, and an exclusive 7-inch featuring \"The Chain\" as an A-side. \"Big Love\" became a standard of the [[Balearic beat]] dance sound,<ref>Alexis Patridis, [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/mar/23/fleetwood-mac-tango-in-the-night-reissue-review \"Fleetwood Mac: Tango in the Night review \u2013 timely reissue coasts from gloss to gloom\"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 23 March 2016.</ref><ref name=\"Stewart2003\">{{cite book|author=Iain Stewart|title=Ibiza and Formentera|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1o8cp-r6PwgC&pg=PA327|year=2003|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=978-1-84353-063-3|page=327}}</ref> and the object of an extended remix by [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]].<ref name=\"FrithGoodwin2006\">{{cite book|author1=Simon Frith|authorlink1=Simon Frith|author2=Andrew Goodwin|title=On Record: Rock, Pop and the Written Word|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xvmJAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT401|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-93950-3|page=401}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\"Big Love\" was written by [[Lindsey Buckingham]] for a third solo album that he began in 1985, which instead became ''Tango in the Night''. The song epitomised the album's stylised production, with its provocative \"oh\u2013ahh\" vocal exchange. Though many assumed the \"female\" \"ahh\" to be [[Stevie Nicks]], Buckingham performed both, his voice being sampled and altered to mimic that of a woman. \"It was odd,\" he said, \"that so many people wondered if it was Stevie on there with me.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Paul|last=Elliott|title=Eye of the hurricane|magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] #189|date=October 2013|p=59}}</ref> \n\n==Solo version==\nAfter Buckingham left Fleetwood Mac in 1987 (shortly after ''Tango in the Night'' was released), the band did not perform \"Big Love\" live until his return in 1997. It was in 1993, on his first solo tour, that Buckingham performed a guitar-only version of the song. When playing \"Big Love\" live, he uses a gutted [[Gibson Chet Atkins SST]] with a [[capo]] on the fourth fret and a synth [[pickup (music technology)|pickup]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.premierguitar.com/articles/Rig_Rundown_Lindsey_Buckingham|title=Rig Rundown - Lindsey Buckingham|last=October 10|first=Jason Shadrick|last2=2012|website=www.premierguitar.com|language=en|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref> In 1997, he performed it in the same style on Fleetwood Mac's live album and video ''[[The Dance (Fleetwood Mac album)|The Dance]]''. It also appeared on the second volume of [[Cameron Crowe]]'s [[Elizabethtown (soundtrack)|''Elizabethtown'' film soundtrack]].
