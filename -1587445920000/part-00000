This is aided by the fact that their Ro-ro vessels have large ramps that can support up to 420 tonnes cargo weight at a time. Together with its partners ([[EUKOR]] and [[Wallenius Lines]]), the group controls some 160 car and [[roll-on/roll-off]] carriers operating in a global network of trades.

This is aided by the fact that their Ro-ro vessels have large ramps that can support up to 420 tonnes cargo weight at a time. Together with its partners ([[EUKOR]] and [[Wallenius Lines]]), the group controls some 160 car and [[roll-on/roll-off]] carriers operating in a global network of trades. Its customers include manufacturers of cars{{which|date=April 2013}} as well as construction and [[agricultural machinery]].{{which|date=April 2013}} In the [[car carrier]] market, they are the third largest carrier tonnage wise after [[Mitsui O.S.K.

Its primary RCAF lodger unit is 8 Wing, commonly referred to as 8 Wing Trenton.  CFB Trenton is Canada's largest Air Force base.\n\nThe airport is classified as an [[airport of entry]] by [[Nav Canada]] and is staffed by the [[Canada Border Services Agency]].
