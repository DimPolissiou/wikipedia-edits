William Makepeace Thackeray was made the first Collector of Sylhet and he was followed by Mr Sumner. Sylhet was strategically important for the British in their pursuit of conquering [[Northeast India]] and [[Upper Burma]]. The British divided the region into four subdivisions further divided into collectory [[Zillah (country subdivision)|zila]]s and then [[pargana]]s. The Qanungohs were abolished for a time during British rule and Wahdadars replaced Choudhuries as local revenue collectors. [[Sylhet District|North Srihatta]] consisted of Parkul, Jaintiapur and Tajpur zilas. [[South Sylhet|South Srihatta]] was made up of Rajnagar, [[Kulaura|Hingazia]] and Noyakhali. [[Habiganj District|Habiganj]] was split into Nabiganj, Laskarpur and Shankarpasha. [[Sunamganj District|Sunamganj]] had one collectory zila at Ramulganj and [[Barak Valley|Karimganj]] at Latu.<ref name=\"purbangsho\"/> During this time, many Western European and [[Armenians|Armenian]] traders migrated to Sylhet and are buried in Sylhet Sadar.<ref name=heads/>\n\nMajor Henniker led the first expedition to Jaintia in 1774. In 1778, after a short term by Mr Holland, the next collector was [[Robert Lindsay (Sylhet)|Robert Lindsay]]. A year into his office, the [[Khasi people|Khasi]] attacked the merchants of Pandua, Bholaganj ([[Companiganj Upazila, Sylhet|Companiganj]]) who were going towards Calcutta after experiencing abuse from other 'Europeans'. Many merchants pleaded Lindsay to build a small brick fort to protect them from further attacks from the Khasi.<ref name=allen/> During the same year, an auction took place in which a purchaser won estates in Balishira ([[South Sylhet]]). With the former owner refusing to give the land, a havildar and ten sepoys were sent to the estate to allow the purchaser his land. The former owner killed two officers and injured many. He then plundered two government boats worth over 2,000 rupees. Reinforcements were sent from Sylhet to Balishira, eventually forcing the former owner to flee. The former owner later returned with a large group of men and attacked the resistance, keeping some as hostage. The former officer and some of his men were later arrested by the authorities in Dacca.<ref name=allen/>\n\nIn 1782, the first ever uprising in the [[Indian subcontinent]] which was against the British rule, the [[Muharram Rebellion]], took place in [[Sylhet Shahi Eidgah]] in which Lindsay killed two of the leaders of the rally, the Pirzada and Syed Muhammad Hadi, with his own pistol. The other leader, Syed Muhammad Mahdi was also killed in the conflict alongside other rebels.<ref name=autobio/> \n\nIn 1783, the headquarters of a [[thana]] was attacked by [[Khasi people|Khasis]] who were provoked by a certain [[havildar]]. The Khasi chiefs demanded the havildar's head which Lindsay refused to give. Many casualties and deaths occurred on both sides, Lindsay's [[Lime plaster|chunam works]] were plundered and his men were said to have been \"cut into pieces\".<ref name=autobio/><ref name=allen/>\n\nIn 1786, the [[Revolt of Radharam]] took place in the [[Pratapgarh Kingdom|Greater Pratapgarh]]. [[Zamindar]] Radha Ram plundered Chargola [[thana]] in Karimganj with the help of [[Kukis]] before escaping. Lindsay reacted by ordering for the burning of Radha Ram's village and the seizing of his cattle. It is said in another incident that the hill tribes attacked the Laur [[thana]], killing 20 people including the [[thana]]dar. In 1787, the Khasis of Laur also rebelled, plundering many [[pargana]]s, such as Atgram, Bangaikunda, Ramdiga, Betal and Selharas, and killing up to 800 people. Before Lindsay's troops could arrive, the Khasis retreated back to their mountains.<ref name=autobio>{{cite book|volume=4|title=Lives of the Lindsays, or, A memoir of the House of Crawford and Balcarres|chapter=Anecdotes of an Indian life: Chapter VII|author=[[Robert Lindsay (Sylhet)|Robert Lindsay]]|url=https://digital.nls.uk/95568541|website=National Library of Scotland}}</ref>\n\nHyndman succeeded Lindsay in late 1787 as the Collector of Sylhet but his term was extremely short and John Willes replaced him.<ref name=heads/> During Willes' office, the Khasi led by Ganga Singh plundered Ishamati thana and [[bazaar]] and killed a Bara-Chaudhri family. In 1789, Willes stationed many sepoys in Pandua (Companiganj). The Khasi however, continued their attacks, killing the thanadar and many sepoys. Two European merchants managed to escape and inform Willes of the incident, who passed it on to the Government at Calcutta. A force was then sent from there, to the village of Pandua although it lead to a bloodless end. Willes also told the government that he really had little control over northern Sylhet as the Khasi chiefs refused every order, would behead the messenger and then continue raiding Sylheti villages as they had done even during the Mughal period. Another Khasi raid took place in 1795 and many years went after that with the Khasis remaining in their hills and not troubling the plains.<ref name=allen/> Willes also changed the administration of Sylhet into ten [[Zillah (country subdivision)|zillahs]], further divided into 164 [[pargana]]s as well as [[Sylhet City|Kusbah Sylhet]]. Revenue was then collected by ten zillahdars assisted by the pargana patowaris. The currency of the Sylhet region was changed from [[Cowrie#Human use|cowries]] to silver coins. During his term, Laskarpur Pargana was also moved from Dacca to Sylhet. Courts were also being established in every zillah.<ref name=heads/>\n\nIn 1799, [[Agha Muhammad Reza]] invaded [[Kachari Kingdom|Cachar]]. With help of [[Naga people|Nagas]] and [[Kukis]], he was able to defeat the barqandaz sent by the Raja of the Kachari Kingdom, and expelled the Raja to the nearby hills. Reza also sent 1,200 men to attack the nearby [[thana]] of the [[East India Company]], administered by one havildar and eight sepoys. The [[Bodo-Kachari people|Kachari army]] then arrived with 300 men and two [[grasshopper cannon]]s but were defeated. During this time, the British were able to gain a reinforcement of 70 sepoys. The army ended up in a brawl between the Kacharis, and the British sepoys eventually drove both groups back leading to 90 deaths in the Kachari side. Reza was later arrested.<ref name=\"purbangsho\"/>\n\nA border dispute started in 1807 between the Khaspur Raja of Cachar, Krishnachandra Narayan, and the Amin Muluk Chand in Badarpur. The Amin would lay down a line, only to find that the Kacharis would fill the ditch up and take all the crops. The Kacharis would also raid Chapghat pargana. The British ordered Badarpur's officer to prevent the intruders from this but they found out that the land in fact belonged to the Raja and not the Amin.\n\nIn 1821, a group of Jaintias kidnapped British subjects attempting to sacrifice them to [[Kali]]. A culprit was then found by the British who admitted that it was an annual tradition which the Jaintias have been doing for 10 years. The priest would cut off the victim's throat and then the Jaintia princess would bathe in his blood. The Jaintia believed that this would bless the princess with offspring. Upon hearing this, the British threatened the Jaintia Raja that they would invade his territories if this does not stop. The Raja made an agreement in 1824 with David Scott that they will only negotiate with the British. A year later, the Jaintias attempted to continue their annual sacrifice which they had previously agreed with the British that they would stop. During the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]] in the same year, British troops based themselves at [[Badarpur, Assam|Badarpur]]. They then advanced to Bikrampur in Cachar where they were defeated. In 1826, the [[Kukis]] of [[Pratapgarh Kingdom|Pratapgarh King]] murdered a group of woodcutters and held three hostages after not receiving an annual gift from the Pratapgarh zamindars. The Kukis then sent one hostage to the British to tell them that they must pay a ransom to free the other two, in which the British agreed. \n\nWith the last Khasi raid taking place in 1795, the British experienced another attack in 1827 in Panduah leading to the death of a sepoy, postman and [[dhobi]]. The Agent to the [[Governor-General of India]], [[William Amherst, 1st Earl Amherst|William Amherst]], was absent and so the Collector of Sylhet ordered his officer to retaliate with the [[Sylhet Light Infantry]]. After the Nongkhlao massacre in Kanta Kal village two years later, Captain Lister and the Infantry defeated the Nongkhlao Khasis, causing them to retreat and never attack the British or raid villages again.\n\nThe Jaintias kidnapped four British men in 1832. Three were sacrificed in Great [[Hindu temple]] in [[Kanaighat|Faljur]], with one escaping and informing the British authorities of the atrocities.<ref name=heads/><ref>{{cite book|title=The Imperial Gazetteer of India|author=[[William Wilson Hunter]]|year=1886|page=164|publisher=Tr\u00fcbner & Company}}</ref> After the Jaintia Raja declined to find the culprits, the British finally conquered the Jaintia Kingdom and incorporated it into the Sylhet District in 1835.<ref name=allen/> Also in 1835, pargana patowaris were replaced by zillah patowaris and muhuris.<ref name=heads/>\n\nThe [[East India Company]] first initiated their trading of tea in the hills of Sylhet.<ref>Colleen Taylor Sen (2004).

Sylhet was strategically important for the British in their pursuit of conquering [[Northeast India]] and [[Upper Burma]]. The British divided the region into four subdivisions further divided into collectory [[Zillah (country subdivision)|zila]]s and then [[pargana]]s. The Qanungohs were abolished for a time during British rule and Wahdadars replaced Choudhuries as local revenue collectors. [[Sylhet District|North Srihatta]] consisted of Parkul, Jaintiapur and Tajpur zilas. [[South Sylhet|South Srihatta]] was made up of Rajnagar, [[Kulaura|Hingazia]] and Noyakhali.

Many merchants pleaded Lindsay to build a small brick fort to protect them from further attacks from the Khasi.<ref name=allen/> During the same year, an auction took place in which a purchaser won estates in Balishira ([[South Sylhet]]). With the former owner refusing to give the land, a havildar and ten sepoys were sent to the estate to allow the purchaser his land. The former owner killed two officers and injured many. He then plundered two government boats worth over 2,000 rupees. Reinforcements were sent from Sylhet to Balishira, eventually forcing the former owner to flee.

[[Zamindar]] Radha Ram plundered Chargola [[thana]] in Karimganj with the help of [[Kukis]] before escaping. Lindsay reacted by ordering for the burning of Radha Ram's village and the seizing of his cattle. It is said in another incident that the hill tribes attacked the Laur [[thana]], killing 20 people including the [[thana]]dar. In 1787, the Khasis of Laur also rebelled, plundering many [[pargana]]s, such as Atgram, Bangaikunda, Ramdiga, Betal and Selharas, and killing up to 800 people. Before Lindsay's troops could arrive, the Khasis retreated back to their mountains.<ref name=autobio>{{cite book|volume=4|title=Lives of the Lindsays, or, A memoir of the House of Crawford and Balcarres|chapter=Anecdotes of an Indian life: Chapter VII|author=[[Robert Lindsay (Sylhet)|Robert Lindsay]]|url=https://digital.nls.uk/95568541|website=National Library of Scotland}}</ref>\n\nHyndman succeeded Lindsay in late 1787 as the Collector of Sylhet but his term was extremely short and John Willes replaced him.<ref name=heads/> During Willes' office, the Khasi led by Ganga Singh plundered Ishamati thana and [[bazaar]] and killed a Bara-Chaudhri family. In 1789, Willes stationed many sepoys in Pandua (Companiganj). The Khasi however, continued their attacks, killing the thanadar and many sepoys. Two European merchants managed to escape and inform Willes of the incident, who passed it on to the Government at Calcutta. A force was then sent from there, to the village of Pandua although it lead to a bloodless end. Willes also told the government that he really had little control over northern Sylhet as the Khasi chiefs refused every order, would behead the messenger and then continue raiding Sylheti villages as they had done even during the Mughal period. Another Khasi raid took place in 1795 and many years went after that with the Khasis remaining in their hills and not troubling the plains.<ref name=allen/> Willes also changed the administration of Sylhet into ten [[Zillah (country subdivision)|zillahs]], further divided into 164 [[pargana]]s as well as [[Sylhet City|Kusbah Sylhet]]. Revenue was then collected by ten zillahdars assisted by the pargana patowaris. The currency of the Sylhet region was changed from [[Cowrie#Human use|cowries]] to silver coins. During his term, Laskarpur Pargana was also moved from Dacca to Sylhet. Courts were also being established in every zillah.<ref name=heads/>\n\nIn 1799, [[Agha Muhammad Reza]] invaded [[Kachari Kingdom|Cachar]]. With help of [[Naga people|Nagas]] and [[Kukis]], he was able to defeat the barqandaz sent by the Raja of the Kachari Kingdom, and expelled the Raja to the nearby hills. Reza also sent 1,200 men to attack the nearby [[thana]] of the [[East India Company]], administered by one havildar and eight sepoys. The [[Bodo-Kachari people|Kachari army]] then arrived with 300 men and two [[grasshopper cannon]]s but were defeated. During this time, the British were able to gain a reinforcement of 70 sepoys. The army ended up in a brawl between the Kacharis, and the British sepoys eventually drove both groups back leading to 90 deaths in the Kachari side. Reza was later arrested.<ref name=\"purbangsho\"/>\n\nA border dispute started in 1807 between the Khaspur Raja of Cachar, Krishnachandra Narayan, and the Amin Muluk Chand in Badarpur. The Amin would lay down a line, only to find that the Kacharis would fill the ditch up and take all the crops. The Kacharis would also raid Chapghat pargana. The British ordered Badarpur's officer to prevent the intruders from this but they found out that the land in fact belonged to the Raja and not the Amin.\n\nIn 1821, a group of Jaintias kidnapped British subjects attempting to sacrifice them to [[Kali]]. A culprit was then found by the British who admitted that it was an annual tradition which the Jaintias have been doing for 10 years. The priest would cut off the victim's throat and then the Jaintia princess would bathe in his blood. The Jaintia believed that this would bless the princess with offspring. Upon hearing this, the British threatened the Jaintia Raja that they would invade his territories if this does not stop. The Raja made an agreement in 1824 with David Scott that they will only negotiate with the British. A year later, the Jaintias attempted to continue their annual sacrifice which they had previously agreed with the British that they would stop. During the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]] in the same year, British troops based themselves at [[Badarpur, Assam|Badarpur]]. They then advanced to Bikrampur in Cachar where they were defeated. In 1826, the [[Kukis]] of [[Pratapgarh Kingdom|Pratapgarh King]] murdered a group of woodcutters and held three hostages after not receiving an annual gift from the Pratapgarh zamindars. The Kukis then sent one hostage to the British to tell them that they must pay a ransom to free the other two, in which the British agreed. \n\nWith the last Khasi raid taking place in 1795, the British experienced another attack in 1827 in Panduah leading to the death of a sepoy, postman and [[dhobi]].

Rutgers Law School has its roots in three law schools.  The first was founded October 5, 1908 as the New Jersey Law School, the second, the South Jersey Law School founded in 1926  by [[Collingswood, New Jersey]] mayor and businessmen Arthur E. Armitage, Sr. and the final was Mercer Beasley School of Law named for a former [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] Justice and founded in 1926 by several prominent Newark attorneys.\n\nThe New Jersey Law School was founded as a for-profit law school by Richard D. Currier, a New York lawyer and graduate of Yale and New York Law School. Currier was joined by Charles M. Mason, a New Jersey attorney, who served as dean until his death in 1928. The school originally had only three faculty members 30 students with classes on the 4th floor of the [[Prudential Headquarters|Prudential Insurance Home Office]] in Newark for their first classes. In December 1908, the school was moved to a large Victorian townhouse at 33 East Park Street also in Newark. From its founding, women were to be admitted on \"equal basis to men.\"\n[[File:RULawYard.JPG|thumb|right|Rear law school courtyard at the Camden campus]]\nAfter World War I, the New Jersey Law School saw increase in enrollment and by 1927, enrollment had peaked to more than 2,300 students, making it the second largest law school in the United States. In 1927 the school moved to the former Ballantine & Sons Ale Brewery at 40 Rector Street.\n\nIn 1934, Mercer Beasley School of Law and Newark Institute of Arts and Sciences merged to form the University of Newark and two years later, the New Jersey Law School joined establishing the University of Newark Law School.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lawwiki.rutgers.edu/yb/docs/his/1938history.pdf|title=History of the School of Law of the University of Newark|last=|first=|date=1938|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref> Combining the resources of the schools was designed created a stronger institution however the law school experienced a major decline in enrollment due to World War II and therefore was in a precarious financial condition.\n\nIn 1946, the University of Newark merged with [[Rutgers University]] and the law school was renamed the Rutgers University School of Law. In 1950, the South Jersey Law School in Camden, New Jersey,  merged with [[Rutgers University]]. The school was divided between the Newark Division and the South Jersey division based in Camden, with the dean and law school administration based in Newark. During the 1950s and 1960s the law school expanded in size creating the largest law library in New Jersey and its faculty tripled in size. In 1963, the now U.S. Supreme Court Justice, [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], was hired as a law professor and served on the faculty until 1972. Ginsburg developed some of the concepts that led to the founding of the Women's Rights Litigation Clinic by Professor Nadine H. Taub, who was its director for many years, and the [[Women's Rights Law Reporter]] the first American legal journal dedicated women's rights.\n\nIn 1967, the South Jersey Division was split and created as a separate unit, creating two law schools: ''Rutgers School of Law \u2013 Camden'' and ''Rutgers School of Law \u2013 Newark''. In 1968, following the Newark riots of 1967, the faculty created the Minority Students Program (MSP) one of the first law school affirmative action programs in the country, with the goal of increasing African American student enrollment. In 1978, the law faculty voted to admit students regardless of race and revamped the Minority Students Program to focus on socio-economically disadvantaged students<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/10/archives/law-school-acts-on-bakke-rule-action-called-proper-response.html|title=Law School Acts on \u2018Bakke Rule\u2019|last=Times|first=Alfonso A.

Bakke|Bakke]]. In ''Doherty V. Rutgers School Of Law-Newark''  the [[3rd Circuit Court of Appeals]] upheld the MSP in a lawsuit from a white student alleging discrimination. Throughout the 1970s the Newark campus was a center of activism and law students nicknamed it \"The People's Electric Law School.\"  Its graduates from this period include United States Senators [[Elizabeth Warren]] and [[Robert Menendez]].

Rutgers Law School has its roots in three law schools.  The first was founded October 5, 1908 as the New Jersey Law School, the second, the South Jersey Law School founded in 1926  by [[Collingswood, New Jersey]] mayor and businessmen Arthur E. Armitage, Sr. and the final was Mercer Beasley School of Law named for a former [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] Justice and founded in 1926 by several prominent Newark attorneys.\n\nThe New Jersey Law School was founded as a for-profit law school by Richard D. Currier, a New York lawyer and graduate of Yale and New York Law School. Currier was joined by Charles M. Mason, a New Jersey attorney, who served as dean until his death in 1928. The school originally had only three faculty members 30 students with classes on the 4th floor of the [[Prudential Headquarters|Prudential Insurance Home Office]] in Newark for their first classes. In December 1908, the school was moved to a large Victorian townhouse at 33 East Park Street also in Newark. From its founding, women were to be admitted on \"equal basis to men.\"\n[[File:RULawYard.JPG|thumb|right|Rear law school courtyard at the Camden campus]]\nAfter World War I, the New Jersey Law School saw increase in enrollment and by 1927, enrollment had peaked to more than 2,300 students, making it the second largest law school in the United States. In 1927 the school moved to the former Ballantine & Sons Ale Brewery at 40 Rector Street.\n\nIn 1934, Mercer Beasley School of Law and Newark Institute of Arts and Sciences merged to form the University of Newark and two years later, the New Jersey Law School joined establishing the University of Newark Law School.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lawwiki.rutgers.edu/yb/docs/his/1938history.pdf|title=History of the School of Law of the University of Newark|last=|first=|date=1938|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref> Combining the resources of the schools was designed created a stronger institution however the law school experienced a major decline in enrollment due to World War II and therefore was in a precarious financial condition.\n\nIn 1946, the University of Newark merged with [[Rutgers University]] and the law school was renamed the Rutgers University School of Law. In 1950, the South Jersey Law School in Camden, New Jersey,  merged with [[Rutgers University]]. The school was divided between the Newark Division and the South Jersey division based in Camden, with the dean and law school administration based in Newark. During the 1950s and 1960s the law school expanded in size creating the largest law library in New Jersey and its faculty tripled in size. In 1963, the now U.S. Supreme Court Justice, [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], was hired as a law professor and served on the faculty until 1972. Ginsburg developed some of the concepts that led to the founding of the Women's Rights Litigation Clinic by Professor Nadine H. Taub, who was its director for many years, and the [[Women's Rights Law Reporter]] the first American legal journal dedicated women's rights.\n\nIn 1967, the South Jersey Division was split and created as a separate unit, creating two law schools: ''Rutgers School of Law \u2013 Camden'' and ''Rutgers School of Law \u2013 Newark''. In 1968, following the Newark riots of 1967, the faculty created the Minority Students Program (MSP) one of the first law school affirmative action programs in the country, with the goal of increasing African American student enrollment. In 1978, the law faculty voted to admit students regardless of race and revamped the Minority Students Program to focus on socio-economically disadvantaged students<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/10/archives/law-school-acts-on-bakke-rule-action-called-proper-response.html|title=Law School Acts on \u2018Bakke Rule\u2019|last=Times|first=Alfonso A.

Bakke|Bakke]]. In ''Doherty V. Rutgers School Of Law-Newark''  the [[3rd Circuit Court of Appeals]] upheld the MSP in a lawsuit from a white student alleging discrimination. Throughout the 1970s the Newark campus was a center of activism and law students nicknamed it \"The People's Electric Law School.\"  Its graduates from this period include United States Senators [[Elizabeth Warren]] and [[Robert Menendez]].

It began instruction in 1847 as a modest effort consisting of three professors: [[Joseph Coerten Hornblower]], [[Richard Stockton Field]], and [[James S. Green (New Jersey lawyer)|James S. Green]]. Only seven students obtained a law degree before the school closed in 1852. The short-lived experiment was the furthest the university got in a recurring ambition, marked by varying levels of effort, to establish a [[law school]].  Previously, in the 1820s, an attempt was made to organize teaching in law, but this plan ended with the death of the designated professor.\n\nIn 1935, the university once again formed appreciable plans for the start of a law school but was unable to secure a faculty. The desire remained after these unsuccessful efforts but aspirations were relegated to thirsting words rather than material preparations. In 1974, then president of Princeton, [[William G. Bowen]], selected a committee to investigate and advise on the achievability of a law school. The committee recommended plans for a law school be deferred after citing high construction costs.

It began instruction in 1847 as a modest effort consisting of three professors: [[Joseph Coerten Hornblower]], [[Richard Stockton Field]], and [[James S. Green (New Jersey lawyer)|James S. Green]]. Only seven students obtained a law degree before the school closed in 1852. The short-lived experiment was the furthest the university got in a recurring ambition, marked by varying levels of effort, to establish a [[law school]].  Previously, in the 1820s, an attempt was made to organize teaching in law, but this plan ended with the death of the designated professor.\n\nIn 1935, the university once again formed appreciable plans for the start of a law school but was unable to secure a faculty. The desire remained after these unsuccessful efforts but aspirations were relegated to thirsting words rather than material preparations. In 1974, then president of Princeton, [[William G. Bowen]], selected a committee to investigate and advise on the achievability of a law school. The committee recommended plans for a law school be deferred after citing high construction costs. Princeton, [[Brown University|Brown]], and [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] are the only [[Ivy League]] schools to lack a law school, and all Princeton graduates who are lawyers will have received their legal training elsewhere.\n\n==Mistaken and fictional references==\nSince Princeton is a large university, many people and even lawyers may be surprised to learn that it does not have a law school.

Harrison earned an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in psychology and [[phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]] from New York City's [[New School for Social Research]] in 1962. He then went to live in Europe to write and direct for the theater.\n\nHarrison taught theater at [[Howard University]] from 1968 to 1970. His students included [[Phylicia Rashad]], [[Debbie Allen]], [[Linda Goss]], [[Pearl Cleage]] and Clinton Turner Davis.\n\nWhile teaching at California State University, Sacramento (1970\u20131972), Harrison conceived and directed Melvin Van Peebles' \"Ain't Supposed To Die a Natural Death\" prior to its Broadway production, and wrote his play ''The Great MacDaddy'' which was produced by the [[Negro Ensemble Company]] in 1973, and won an [[Obie Award]].\n\nHarrison taught at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] from 1972 to 1976 before moving on to Columbia College Chicago in 1976 to work as Chair, Professor, and Writer in Residence at the Theatre Department until his retirement in 2002.  He is currently Professor Emeritus.\n\n==Young Life==\nPaul Carter Harrison is an African American man born on March 1, 1936 to Thelma Inez and Paul Randolph Harrison whom were born in North and South Carolina but raised in New York City.  His brother, Kenneth Allen Harrison was the first black basketball player on scholarship at Villanova University.  Harrison attended Commerce High School and graduated in 1952. While attending New York University, Harrison was introduced to many writers and theater artists such as Lou Gossett, Jr., Billy Dee Williams, Amiri Baraka (LeRoi Jones), and Ted Joans. He transferred to Indiana University where he interacted with musicians such as Freddie Hubbard, Larry Ridley, and David Baker.\n\n==Europe==\nAfter graduating from the New School, Harrison went to Spain and the Netherlands for seven years where he worked on his writing and theatre skills. During his time out of the country he wrote a movie called \u201cStranger On The Square\u201d.  His first book of edited essays \"The Modern Drama Footnote\", was published in Amsterdam, as well as his plays, \"Pavane for a Deadpan Minstrel\" and \"Tophat\".  Other plays written, performed and directed in the Netherlands included, \"The Post Clerks\" and \u201cThe Experimental Leader\u201d, the latter becoming the center piece for his book commonly known as \u201cDialogue from the Opposition\u201d.\nHowever, since the English version of this work isn't available the title \"Dialogue from the Opposition\" seems to be a rather tame re-translation of its Dutch version's title. The Dutch publication is named \"Dialoog van het verzet\" which is more accurately translated as \"Dialogue of (the) resistance/rebellion\". The original English title as it was written by Harrison is noted in the book by Dutch translators (friend of Harrison: H.J.A. Hofland and, Carla van Splunteren) as \"A Rebel's Dialogue\".\nWhile living in Amsterdam, Harrison married the Dutch actress, Ria Vroemen who gave birth to his daughter, Fonteyn in 1963.\n\n==Accomplishments==\nOn August 6 of 1988, Paul Carter Harrison married his wife, Wanda Malone. Harrison's work as a playwright and theatre theorist has been published and produced in Europe and the United States, causing him to win awards for his work. His play, \u201cGreat Macdaddy\u201d won an Obie Award and \u201cTabernacle\u201d won the Audelco Award for Best Creative Musical. He also has written and edited many other plays, anthologies, and books that involved theatre and jazz performers. \u201cThe Drama of Nommo\u201d is a book he wrote, which is a collection of essays that identified African retentions in the aesthetic of African American culture and has helped many directors in the Black Theatre practice. Harrison is known for coming up with terms such as \u201cNommo\u201d and Mother/Word\u201d as constructive references for Black Theatre. His most recent book, \u201cBlack Theatre: Ritual Performance in the African Diaspora\u201d, was published  in the Spring of 2002. His most current task was writing the libretto for \"Doxology Opera: the Doxy Canticles\", a full-length opera composed by [[Wendell Logan]] which was premiered in a concert version at the Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art in 2002. He has also written the text for the operetta, \"Goree Crossing\" with music by Olu Dara that was also given a concert performance at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago.  As Dramaturg for the ETA Theatre in Chicago, Harrison developed Marcia Leslie's highly successful play, \"The Trial of One Short-sighte Black Woman vs Mammie Louise and Safreeta Mae\".  His most recent conceptualization and direction is \"Sweet Thunder: the Billie Strayhorn Story\" which has been performed at the Phoenix Black Theatre Troupe and the [[Kuntu Repertory Theatre]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]].
