Known as '''The Spark''' and as '''MC47''' from his initials and his jersey number, he is also half of \"The Fast and The Furious\", along with his backcourt partner, [[Jayjay Helterbrand]].\n\n==College career==\nCaguioa was born and raised in the Philippines and spent his adolescent years in [[Eagle Rock, Los Angeles]], California. He played collegiate basketball at [[Glendale Community College (California)|Glendale Community College]]. He was named to the First Team All-[[Western State Conference]] after the 1999\u20132000 season.\n\n==Barangay Ginebra (2001\u2013present)==\nIn 2001, Caguioa was drafted by the [[Barangay Ginebra San Miguel|Barangay Ginebra Kings]] as the third overall pick.<ref name=\"pba online\" /> Expectations were not high as Caguioa started as a role player and backup for superstar [[Vergel Meneses]]. However, after showing strong performances and helping to lead the Kings to the [[2001 PBA All-Filipino Cup Finals|2001 All-Filipino Cup Finals]], he became very popular. With his [[Crossover dribble|crossovers]], drives to the basket, and penchant for making clutch plays, Caguioa earned the respect and admiration of the Filipino basketball fans. His exciting brand of play earned him the moniker \"The Spark.\" At the end of his first season, Caguioa was the third Ginebra player, after [[Dondon Ampalayo]] in 1986 and [[Marlou Aquino]] in 1996, to win the [[Philippine Basketball Association Rookie of the Year award|Rookie of the Year]] award. For the 2011\u20132012 season, he won the Most Valuable Player award.<ref name=\"pba online\" />\n\n===\"The Fast and The Furious\"===\nIn the [[2004\u201305 PBA season|2004\u201305 season]], Caguioa, along with his backcourt partner [[Jayjay Helterbrand]], formed a strong tandem, which was dubbed as \"The Fast and The Furious\".<ref>[http://www.spin.ph/basketball/pba/news/mark-caguioa-turns-emotional-as-fast-and-furious-chase-pba-title-together-one-last-time- Mark Caguioa turns emotional as 'Fast and Furious' duo chase title together, perhaps for one last time], Gerry Ramos, spin.ph, October 4, 2016</ref> Their play enabled Ginebra to win back-to-back championships. Caguioa also set his then career high for points in a single game during that season, scoring 43 points (he later eclipsed this by scoring 45 points) in Game 4 of the Philippine Cup Finals against the [[Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters|Talk 'N Text Phone Pals]].\n\nIn the [[2006 PBA Philippine Cup|2006 Philippine Cup]], Caguioa earned \"Player of the Week\" honors three times. He led the league in scoring at 24 points per game, and broke his previous career high for points in a single game, scoring 45 points in a losing effort against [[Barako Bull Energy Boosters (2000\u201311)|Red Bull]] in the quarterfinals. He became the first guard to finish a single season as the league's leading scorer since [[Allan Caidic]] in 1995.\n\nIn the 2007 Philippine Cup, Caguioa averaged 24.7 points per game in the 23 games he played. He also led the league in statistical points for the Best Player of the Conference Award. Caguioa piloted Ginebra to their seventh championship in franchise history by besting the [[San Miguel Beermen]] in a best-of-seven finals. During their series against Talk 'N Text in the semifinals, Caguioa scored 34, 31, 26, 35, and 31 points in the five games. Caguioa won the 2007 PBA Best Player of the Conference.<ref name=\"pba online\" />\n\nCaguioa again helped his team during the [[2008 PBA Fiesta Conference]], culminating in the team's eighth championship. He also led the league in scoring.\n\nIn the 2008\u201309 season, Caguioa failed to suit up for Kings due to his therapy in the United States for [[tendinitis]] on both knees.\n\nCaguioa received the MVP award and back to back Best Player of the Conference awards in 2011 and 2012.<ref name=\"pba online\" />\n\nIn October 5, 2018 against [[NLEX Road Warriors]], Caguioa scores 16 points to join the PBA 10,000 points club.\n\n==International career==\nCaguioa was named in the [[Philippines men's national basketball team|RP Training Pool]] for future international competitions. He participated in several exhibition games against the [[Iran national basketball team|Iranian National Team]] and the NBL's [[Sydney Kings]] in mid-2005, where he impressed the latter team's coach by scoring 27 points. He has also played in the 2005 FIBA Asia Champions Cup held in the Philippines, in which his team finished fifth. He averaged 19.8 points and 3.4 rebounds per game in that tournament.\n\nHowever, Caguioa was eventually dropped from the team. National mentor [[Chot Reyes]] claimed that Caguioa had failed to appear for several practice sessions.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nIn 2007, he joined the national team that won the [[Southeast Asia Basketball Association|SEABA]] Championship with a perfect record and finished ninth place with a record of 5\u20132 in the [[2007 FIBA Asia Championship]].\n\n==PBA career

Association]] (PBA). Known as '''The Spark''' and as '''MC47''' from his initials and his jersey number, he is also half of \"The Fast and The Furious\", along with his backcourt partner, [[Jayjay Helterbrand]].\n\n==College career==\nCaguioa was born and raised in the Philippines and spent his adolescent years in [[Eagle Rock, Los Angeles]], California. He played collegiate basketball at [[Glendale Community College (California)|Glendale Community College]]. He was named to the First Team All-[[Western State Conference]] after the 1999\u20132000 season.\n\n==Barangay Ginebra (2001\u2013present)==\nIn 2001, Caguioa was drafted by the [[Barangay Ginebra San Miguel|Barangay Ginebra Kings]] as the third overall pick.<ref name=\"pba online\" /> Expectations were not high as Caguioa started as a role player and backup for superstar [[Vergel Meneses]]. However, after showing strong performances and helping to lead the Kings to the [[2001 PBA All-Filipino Cup Finals|2001 All-Filipino Cup Finals]], he became very popular. With his [[Crossover dribble|crossovers]], drives to the basket, and penchant for making clutch plays, Caguioa earned the respect and admiration of the Filipino basketball fans. His exciting brand of play earned him the moniker \"The Spark.\" At the end of his first season, Caguioa was the third Ginebra player, after [[Dondon Ampalayo]] in 1986 and [[Marlou Aquino]] in 1996, to win the [[Philippine Basketball Association Rookie of the Year award|Rookie of the Year]] award. For the 2011\u20132012 season, he won the Most Valuable Player award.<ref name=\"pba online\" />\n\n===\"The Fast and The Furious\"===\nIn the [[2004\u201305 PBA season|2004\u201305 season]], Caguioa, along with his backcourt partner [[Jayjay Helterbrand]], formed a strong tandem, which was dubbed as \"The Fast and The Furious\".<ref>[http://www.spin.ph/basketball/pba/news/mark-caguioa-turns-emotional-as-fast-and-furious-chase-pba-title-together-one-last-time- Mark Caguioa turns emotional as 'Fast and Furious' duo chase title together, perhaps for one last time], Gerry Ramos, spin.ph, October 4, 2016</ref> Their play enabled Ginebra to win back-to-back championships. Caguioa also set his then career high for points in a single game during that season, scoring 43 points (he later eclipsed this by scoring 45 points) in Game 4 of the Philippine Cup Finals against the [[Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters|Talk 'N Text Phone Pals]].\n\nIn the [[2006 PBA Philippine Cup|2006 Philippine Cup]], Caguioa earned \"Player of the Week\" honors three times. He led the league in scoring at 24 points per game, and broke his previous career high for points in a single game, scoring 45 points in a losing effort against [[Barako Bull Energy Boosters (2000\u201311)|Red Bull]] in the quarterfinals. He became the first guard to finish a single season as the league's leading scorer since [[Allan Caidic]] in 1995.\n\nIn the 2007 Philippine Cup, Caguioa averaged 24.7 points per game in the 23 games he played. He also led the league in statistical points for the Best Player of the Conference Award. Caguioa piloted Ginebra to their seventh championship in franchise history by besting the [[San Miguel Beermen]] in a best-of-seven finals. During their series against Talk 'N Text in the semifinals, Caguioa scored 34, 31, 26, 35, and 31 points in the five games. Caguioa won the 2007 PBA Best Player of the Conference.<ref name=\"pba online\" />\n\nCaguioa again helped his team during the [[2008 PBA Fiesta Conference]], culminating in the team's eighth championship. He also led the league in scoring.\n\nIn the 2008\u201309 season, Caguioa failed to suit up for Kings due to his therapy in the United States for [[tendinitis]] on both knees.\n\nCaguioa received the MVP award and back to back Best Player of the Conference awards in 2011 and 2012.<ref name=\"pba online\" />\n\nIn October 5, 2018 against [[NLEX Road Warriors]], Caguioa scores 16 points to join the PBA 10,000 points club.\n\n==International career==\nCaguioa was named in the [[Philippines men's national basketball team|RP Training Pool]] for future international competitions. He participated in several exhibition games against the [[Iran national basketball team|Iranian National Team]] and the NBL's [[Sydney Kings]] in mid-2005, where he impressed the latter team's coach by scoring 27 points. He has also played in the 2005 FIBA Asia Champions Cup held in the Philippines, in which his team finished fifth. He averaged 19.8 points and 3.4 rebounds per game in that tournament.\n\nHowever, Caguioa was eventually dropped from the team. National mentor [[Chot Reyes]] claimed that Caguioa had failed to appear for several practice sessions.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nIn 2007, he joined the national team that won the [[Southeast Asia Basketball Association|SEABA]] Championship with a perfect record and finished ninth place with a record of 5\u20132 in the [[2007 FIBA Asia Championship]].\n\n==PBA career statistics==\n{{PBA player statistics legend}}\n''Correct as of October 19, 2016''<ref name=\"pba online\">[http://www.pba-online.net/profile/Mark-Caguioa/84/ Player Profile] at PBA-Online!</ref>\n\n===Season-by-season averages===\n{{PBA player statistics start}}\n|-\n| align=left | {{pbay|2001}}\n| align=left | [[Barangay Ginebra San Miguel|Barangay Ginebra]]\n| 52 || 26.1 || .467 || '''.422''' || '''.870''' || 4.9 || 1.7 || '''1.0''' || .1 || 13.8\n|-\n| align=left | {{pbay|2002}}\n| align=left | Barangay Ginebra\n| 30 || 29.5 || .438 || .333 || .865 || 4.2 || 2.3 || .6 || .0 || 13.3\n|-\n| align=left | {{pbay|2003}}\n| align=left | Barangay Ginebra\n| 41 || 35.6 || .421 || .329 || .750 || 6.0 || 2.7 || '''1.0''' || .1 || 17.3\n|-\n| align=left | {{pbay|2004}}\n| align=left | Barangay Ginebra\n| '''78''' || 37.4 || '''.491''' || .331 || .799 || '''6.3''' || 3.1 || '''1.0''' || .1 || 18.7\n|-\n| align=left | {{pbay|2005}}\n| align=left | Barangay Ginebra\n| 48 || 37.7 || .418 || .258 || .741 || 5.8 || 2.5 || '''1.0''' || '''.2''' || 20.6\n|-\n| align=left | {{pbay|2006}}\n| align=left | Barangay Ginebra\n| 30 || '''38.7''' || .425 || .329 || .738 || 4.9 || '''4.4''' || .9 || '''.2''' || '''24.6'''\n|-\n| align=left | {{pbay|2007}}\n| align=left | Barangay Ginebra\n| 39 || 32.1 || .486 || .304 || .648 || 4.2 || 2.2 || .8 || .1 || 19.8\n|-\n| align=left | {{pbay|2009}}\n| align=left | Barangay Ginebra\n| 34 || 22.7 || .428 || .225 || .785 || 3.1 || 1.6 || .8 || .0 || 18.4\n|-\n| align=left | {{pbay|2010}}\n| align=left | Barangay Ginebra\n| 57 || 28.7 || .418 || .309 || .759 || 5.3 || 2.4 || .7 || .0 || 16.0\n|-\n| align=left | {{pbay|2011}}\n| align=left | Barangay Ginebra\n| 41 || 30.6 || .397 || .330 || .760 || 4.8 || 2.3 || .7 || .1 || 19.4\n|-\n| align=left | {{pbay|2012}}\n| align=left | Barangay Ginebra\n| 41 || 32.2 || .403 || .283 || .728 || 4.5 || 2.6 || .7 || .0 || 17.2\n|-\n| align=left | {{pbay|2013}}\n| align=left | Barangay Ginebra\n| 43 || 26.7 || .416 || .360 || .806 || 4.1 || 2.0 || .3 || '''.2''' || 10.6\n|-\n| align=left | {{pbay|2014}}\n| align=left | Barangay Ginebra\n| 33 || 25.8 || .411 || .217 || .863 || 3.8 || 1.9 || .6 || .1 || 9.9\n|-\n| align=left | {{pbay|2015}}\n| align=left | Barangay Ginebra\n| 49 || 21.9 || .392 || .102 || .800 || 3.3 || 1.8 || .6 || .1 || 7.0\n|-class=sortbottom\n| align=center colspan=2 | Career\n| 616 || 30.7 || .435 || .309 || .763 || 4.8 || 2.4 || .8 || .1 || 15.6\n{{s-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Barangay Ginebra San Miguel current roster}}\n{{navboxes\n|list=\n{{Philippines Squad 2007 William Jones Cup}}\n{{Philippines Squad 2007 FIBA Asia Championship}}\n{{Barangay Ginebra Kings 2004 PBA Fiesta Conference Champions}}\n{{Barangay Ginebra Kings 2004-05 PBA Philippine Cup Champions}}\n{{Barangay Ginebra Kings 2006\u201307 PBA Philippine Cup Champions}}\n{{Barangay Ginebra Kings 2008 PBA Fiesta Conference Champions}}\n{{Barangay Ginebra San Miguel 2016 PBA Governors' Cup Champions}}\n{{Barangay Ginebra San Miguel 2017 PBA Governors' Cup Champions}}\n{{Barangay Ginebra San Miguel 2018 PBA Commissioner's Cup Champions}}\n{{Barangay Ginebra San Miguel 2019 PBA Governors' Cup Champions}}\n{{PBA Rookies of the Year}}\n{{PBA Mr. Quality Minutes}}\n{{PBA BPCs}}\n{{PBA MVPs}}\n{{PBA Comeback Players of the Year}}\n{{PBA40}}\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Caguioa, Mark}}\n[[Category:1979 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Barangay Ginebra San Miguel players]]\n[[Category:Basketball players from Metro Manila]]\n[[Category:Filipino emigrants to the United States]]\n[[Category:Filipino men's basketball players]]\n[[Category:Glendale Community College (California) alumni]]\n[[Category:Junior college men's basketball players in the United States]]\n[[Category:People from San Juan, Metro Manila]]\n[[Category:Philippine Basketball Association All-Stars]]\n[[Category:Philippines men's national basketball team players]]\n[[Category:Shooting guards]]\n", "name_user": "Sadiel&Caramel", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Caguioa"}

It serves 26 stations between [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]] and Portland, running predominantly east\u2013west. An [[airport rail link]], the line connects central Beaverton, [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|Portland City Center]], and [[Neighborhoods of Portland, Oregon#Northeast|Northeast Portland]] to [[Portland International Airport]]. From [[Beaverton Transit Center]] to [[Gateway/Northeast 99th Avenue Transit Center]], the Red Line shares its route with the [[MAX Blue Line|Blue Line]] and the [[MAX Green Line|Green Line]]; it then splits to a {{convert|5.5|mi|km|1|adj=on}} segment to [[Portland International Airport station]], referred to as the '''Airport MAX''' extension. Service runs for 22 hours per day on a [[headway]] of at least 15 minutes daily. It is the second-busiest service in the MAX system, carrying an average of 22,530 passengers per weekday in September 2019.\n\nProposals for an airport light rail service surfaced in the mid-1980s and efforts were accelerated following Portland International Airport's rapid expansion in the 1990s. Conceived from an unsolicited proposal from engineering company [[Bechtel]] in 1997, the Airport MAX project was designed and built under a [[public\u2013private partnership]] between a [[consortium]] of Bechtel and [[Trammell Crow Company|Trammell Crow]], the [[Port of Portland (Oregon)|Port of Portland]], and local governments. The extension began construction in 1999 and was completed in just under two years due to local and private financing and the utilization of existing public [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]].

It serves 26 stations between [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]] and Portland, running predominantly east\u2013west. An [[airport rail link]], the line connects central Beaverton, [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|Portland City Center]], and [[Neighborhoods of Portland, Oregon#Northeast|Northeast Portland]] to [[Portland International Airport]]. From [[Beaverton Transit Center]] to [[Gateway/Northeast 99th Avenue Transit Center]], the Red Line shares its route with the [[MAX Blue Line|Blue Line]] and the [[MAX Green Line|Green Line]]; it then splits to a {{convert|5.5|mi|km|1|adj=on}} segment to [[Portland International Airport station]], referred to as the '''Airport MAX''' extension. Service runs for 22 hours per day on a [[headway]] of at least 15 minutes daily. It is the second-busiest service in the MAX system, carrying an average of 22,530 passengers per weekday in September 2019.\n\nProposals for an airport light rail service surfaced in the mid-1980s and efforts were accelerated following Portland International Airport's rapid expansion in the 1990s. Conceived from an unsolicited proposal from engineering company [[Bechtel]] in 1997, the Airport MAX project was designed and built under a [[public\u2013private partnership]] between a [[consortium]] of Bechtel and [[Trammell Crow Company|Trammell Crow]], the [[Port of Portland (Oregon)|Port of Portland]], and local governments. The extension began construction in 1999 and was completed in just under two years due to local and private financing and the utilization of existing public [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]]. The Red Line commenced service between downtown Portland and the airport on September&nbsp;10, 2001. Amid strong westside ridership on the Blue Line, Red Line service was extended west along existing tracks to Beaverton Transit Center in 2003. TriMet is planning several improvements for the line, including a further extension west to [[Fair Complex/Hillsboro Airport station]] in [[Hillsboro, Oregon|Hillsboro]] by 2024.\n\n==History==\n===Background and partnership agreement===\n[[File:Cascade Station shopping center entrance - Portland, Oregon.JPG|thumb|left|alt=a road entrance to Cascade Station facing Sports Authority|Cascade Station shopping center, which Bechtel developed in exchange for building the Airport MAX]]\n\nDuring the preliminary design phase of [[Interstate 205 (Oregon\u2013Washington)|Interstate 205]] (I-205) in 1975, Portland transportation planners recommended downsizing the freeway and including right-of-way reserved for future transit; this was later realized as the [[I-205 Transitway]].<ref name=\"Selinger-2015\">{{cite web |title=Making History: 45 Years of Transit in the Portland Region |last=Selinger |first=Philip |date=2015 |publisher=TriMet |url=https://trimet.org/pdfs/history/making-history.pdf |access-date=July 26, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509021212/https://trimet.org/pdfs/history/making-history.pdf |archive-date=May 9, 2018 |url-status=unfit}}</ref>{{rp|82}} In 1986, transit plans by [[Metro (Oregon regional government)|Metro]] regional government began calling for a light rail extension to [[Portland International Airport]],<ref>{{cite news |last=Kohler |first=Vince |title=Metro study group finds interest in light-rail line along I-205 |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=March 27, 1986 |page=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Bodine |first=Harry |title=Light rail expansion backed by officials |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=September 30, 1987 |page=B12}}</ref> which was then being served by TriMet buses,<ref name=\"Route switches\">{{cite news |last=Stewart |first=Bill |title=Most Tri-Met fares rise Saturday, while route switches start Sept. 9 |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=August 31, 2001 |page=B1}}</ref> with construction projected to begin around 2010.<ref name=\"max-red-line-factsheet-2016\"/> Original plans envisioned a line running from the airport to [[Clackamas County, Oregon|Clackamas County]] along the I-205 Transitway and connecting with MAX at [[Gateway/Northeast 99th Avenue Transit Center]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Mayer |first=James |title=Tri-Met looks to the future: The success of MAX sparks dreams of expanding |date=April 9, 1989 |newspaper=The Oregonian |page=A1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Briggs |first=Kara |title=Metro considers transit options along I-205 |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=July 24, 2002 |page=D2}}</ref> Later studies abandoned I-205 in favor of a route between [[Hazel Dell, Washington|Hazel Dell]] in [[Washington (State)|Washington]] and [[Clackamas Town Center]] via [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown Portland]].<ref>{{cite news |last=McCarthy |first=Dennis |title=Light-rail service?

Edmond's  father, [[Jacob Safra]], had opened the J. E. Safra Bank in 1920 in [[Beirut]]. By the time when he was sixteen, Edmond Safra was working at his father's bank in Beirut, Lebanon, and was engaged in the precious metals and foreign exchange aspects of the business.\n\nIn 1949, the family moved from Lebanon to Italy, where he worked for a trading company in [[Milan]]. The family moved again in 1952, this time to Brazil, where Edmond Safra and his father founded their first Brazilian financial institution in 1955.\n\nIn 1956, Edmond Safra settled in Geneva to set up a private bank, the [[Trade Development Bank]], which grew from an original US$1&nbsp;million to US$5&nbsp;billion during the 1980s. He extended his financial empire to satisfy his wealthy clients from around the world. He also founded the [[Republic New York|Republic National Bank of New York]] in 1966, and, later,  Republic National Bank of New York (Suisse) in Geneva. The Republic bank operated 80 branches in the New York area, making it the number three branch network in the metropolitan region behind Citigroup and Chase Manhattan.\n\nThe sale of Trade Development Bank to [[American Express]] for more than US$450&nbsp;million in 1983, turned into a legal battle between the two parties. The financier came out on top, winning a public apology from American Express for starting a smear campaign against him<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-04-28/business/fi-1108_1_american-express | work=The Los Angeles Times | title=Controversy at American Express | first=Victor F. | last=Zonana | date=April 28, 1992}}</ref> and US$8&nbsp;million in damages, all of which he donated to charities.\n\nIn 1988, he also founded Safra Republic Holdings S.A., a [[Luxembourg]] bank holding company.<ref>Business Week, March, 7th, 1994, \"The Mystery Man of Finance, Inside the World of Billionaire Banker Edmond Safra\".</ref>\n\nBy the early 1990s, Safra's fortune was an estimated at US$2.5&nbsp;billion. He was a major [[philanthropist]] during his lifetime, and he left his wealth to the Edmond J. Safra Philanthropic Foundation<ref name=\"edmondjsafra_2016-06-16\"/> which supports hundreds of projects in fifty countries around the world in the areas of education, science and medicine, religion, culture and humanitarian assistance.\n\nIn 1996 Safra co-founded [[Hermitage Capital Management]] with [[Beny Steinmetz]] and [[Bill Browder]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=|title=Red notice : a true story of high finance, murder, and one man's fight for justice|last=Browder|first=Bill|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=2015|isbn=9781476755717|location=New York|pages=84, 87|oclc=883146703}}</ref> The hedge fund became one of the most important investment companies in Russia and later became famous in connection with the [[Sergei Magnitsky]] affair.\n\nAs he approached his 60s, the financier divided his time between his homes in [[Monaco]], [[Geneva]], and New York City and the [[Villa Leopolda]] on the [[French Riviera]].

Safra Philanthropic Foundation]] carries on this work today in his memory.\n\nCommitted to his Jewish faith, he believed that constructing and renovating synagogues was important in places where there was a potential for a Jewish community to flourish, and synagogues around the world bearing his father's name testify to this commitment. Many of these were built in the world's major Jewish centers, but he also helped to build synagogues in more remote communities such as Manila and [[Kinshasa]].\n\n500 years after the last synagogue was built in [[Madrid]] he constructed a new one. He also helped to renovate and enlarge synagogues in [[Amsterdam]], [[Istanbul]], [[Naples]], [[Budapest]], [[Rhodes]], and [[Vienna]]. He saved the oldest synagogue in France, in [[Clermont-Ferrand]], from destruction by buying it for the community, and he contributed to the expansion of the [[Cannes]] synagogue and Synagogue Beth El in Paris.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bethel-net.org/|title=bethel online|website=www.bethel-net.org}}</ref> He also helped refurbish synagogues in many small French cities including [[\u00c9vian-les-Bains|\u00c9vian]], [[Annemasse]], and others. Among the synagogues is the [[Edmond J. Safra Synagogue]] in [[New York City]].\n\nIn addition to supporting a number of synagogues in [[Israel]], the tombs of [[Rabbi Meir|Rabbi Meir Baal Haness]] and [[Simeon bar Yochai|Rabbi Shimon Bar Yohai]] (2nd century CE) were especially important to him, and he was a generous supporter of these pilgrimage sites. For many years on [[Shavuot]] eve, the anniversary of his father's death, he would pray at the tomb of Rabbi Meir until dawn.\n\nDuring his lifetime Safra donated millions of dollars to provide treatment for the sick. Hospitals across the globe \u2013 the H\u00f4pital Cantonal de Gen\u00e8ve, the [[Assistance Publique \u2013 H\u00f4pitaux de Paris|H\u00f4pitaux de France]], and countless institutions in the United States, for example \u2013 benefited from his generosity. He was one of the founders of [[Albert Einstein Hospital]] in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], today one of [[South America]]\u2019s major medical centers. In [[Israel]], he initiated the construction of the Edmond and Lily Safra Children's Hospital at [[Tel Hashomer]].\n\nIn the area of medical research, he was a significant supporter of the [[Pasteur Institute|Institut Pasteur]] in Paris, the [[Weizmann Institute]] in Israel, the [[The Michael J. Fox Foundation|Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research]] and a number of different centers studying specific diseases in France, the United States, and elsewhere around the world. He created the Edmond and Lily Safra Chair in Breast Cancer Research at [[Tulane University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohr.tulane.edu/news/newwave/011508_cancer.cfm?RenderForPrint=1|title=Tulane University - Shedding New Light on Cancer Risk|website=www.ohr.tulane.edu}}</ref>\n\nSafra believed higher education was essential for every young person in the modern world, even though he himself never attended university. He provided university scholarship funds for tens of thousands of needy students through the International Sephardic Education Foundation (ISEF), an institution he and his wife established in 1977 to support deserving Israeli students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iseffoundation.org/programs/edmond-j-safra-scholarships/|title=Edmond J. Safra Scholars - ISEF Foundation - Israel Education - Israel Scholarships - Non-Profit - Israel and New York|website=iseffoundation.org}}</ref>\n\nSafra also helped universities directly, often through the support of chairs and particular programs (such as Judaic Studies). For example, at [[Harvard University]] he endowed the Jacob E. Safra Professorship of Jewish History and Sephardic Civilization, and the [[Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics]]; and he gave significant funds for the Robert F. Kennedy Visiting Professorship in Latin American Studies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ro.drclas.harvard.edu/pages/robert-f-kennedy-visiting-professorship-latin-american-studies|title=RFK Visiting Professorship in Latin American Studies|publisher=}}</ref> At the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, he created the Jacob E. Safra Professorship of International Banking and the Safra Business Research Center.\n\nHe was awarded Honorary Doctorates by the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] and [[Yeshiva University|Yeshiva University (New York)]] (where he established the Jacob E. Safra Institute of Sephardic Studies) for his ongoing support of those institutions.\n\nWith respect to younger children's education, he was especially devoted to schools in the cities where he lived \u2013 for example, he founded Ecole Girsa,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alliancegirsa.ch/notre-histoire/|title=Ecole Alliance Girsa - Ecole juive Gen\u00e8ve - Membre de l'Alliance Universelle Isra\u00e9lite|publisher=}}</ref> Geneva's first and largest Jewish school. He took great pride in founding the Beit Yaacov school in [[Bat Yam]]. He was also one of the world's most significant benefactors of yeshivot (religious schools training young men to be rabbis, Jewish teachers, and judges), assisting numerous institutions worldwide.<ref>''Aleppo: City of Scholars'', the Jack Adjmi edition, Rabbi David Sutton, 2005.</ref>\n\nIn France, the Edmond J.

Edmond's  father, [[Jacob Safra]], had opened the J. E. Safra Bank in 1920 in [[Beirut]]. By the time when he was sixteen, Edmond Safra was working at his father's bank in Beirut, Lebanon, and was engaged in the precious metals and foreign exchange aspects of the business.\n\nIn 1949, the family moved from Lebanon to Italy, where he worked for a trading company in [[Milan]]. The family moved again in 1952, this time to Brazil, where Edmond Safra and his father founded their first Brazilian financial institution in 1955.\n\nIn 1956, Edmond Safra settled in Geneva to set up a private bank, the [[Trade Development Bank]], which grew from an original US$1&nbsp;million to US$5&nbsp;billion during the 1980s. He extended his financial empire to satisfy his wealthy clients from around the world. He also founded the [[Republic New York|Republic National Bank of New York]] in 1966, and, later,  Republic National Bank of New York (Suisse) in Geneva. The Republic bank operated 80 branches in the New York area, making it the number three branch network in the metropolitan region behind Citigroup and Chase Manhattan.\n\nThe sale of Trade Development Bank to [[American Express]] for more than US$450&nbsp;million in 1983, turned into a legal battle between the two parties. The financier came out on top, winning a public apology from American Express for starting a smear campaign against him<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-04-28/business/fi-1108_1_american-express | work=The Los Angeles Times | title=Controversy at American Express | first=Victor F. | last=Zonana | date=April 28, 1992}}</ref> and US$8&nbsp;million in damages, all of which he donated to charities.\n\nIn 1988, he also founded Safra Republic Holdings S.A., a [[Luxembourg]] bank holding company.<ref>Business Week, March, 7th, 1994, \"The Mystery Man of Finance, Inside the World of Billionaire Banker Edmond Safra\".</ref>\n\nBy the early 1990s, Safra's fortune was an estimated at US$2.5&nbsp;billion. He was a major [[philanthropist]] during his lifetime, and he left his wealth to the Edmond J. Safra Philanthropic Foundation<ref name=\"edmondjsafra_2016-06-16\"/> which supports hundreds of projects in fifty countries around the world in the areas of education, science and medicine, religion, culture and humanitarian assistance.\n\nIn 1996 Safra co-founded [[Hermitage Capital Management]] with [[Beny Steinmetz]] and [[Bill Browder]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=|title=Red notice : a true story of high finance, murder, and one man's fight for justice|last=Browder|first=Bill|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=2015|isbn=9781476755717|location=New York|pages=84, 87|oclc=883146703}}</ref> The hedge fund became one of the most important investment companies in Russia and later became famous in connection with the [[Sergei Magnitsky]] affair.\n\nAs he approached his 60s, the financier divided his time between his homes in [[Monaco]], [[Geneva]], and New York City and the [[Villa Leopolda]] on the [[French Riviera]]. Weakened by [[Parkinson's disease]], he required nursing care.\n\n==Death==\nIn December 1999, Safra and nurse Vivian Torrente were suffocated by fumes in a fire deliberately lit at the billionaire's Monaco home,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/23767683 |title=Billionaire's mysterious death in Monte Carlo - Dateline NBC - International &#124; NBC News |publisher=NBC News |date=2008-03-23 |accessdate=2017-02-26 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/23767683/ns/dateline_nbc-international/t/billionaires-mysterious-death-monte-carlo/|title=Billionaire's mysterious death in Monte Carlo|date=2008-03-23|work=msnbc.com|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/23767683 The mystery of the billionaire banker], ''Dateline NBC'', March 23, 2008.</ref> where he apparently felt so safe that he did not have his bodyguards stay the night.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05E2DE113EF934A35751C1A96F958260 | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | first=Suzanne | last=Daley | title=Nurse Is Said to Admit Arson That Killed Banker in Monaco | date=7 December 1999}}</ref>\n\nAnother bodyguard and nurse, American [[Ted Maher]], who was sharing the night shift with Torrente at the time, was arrested<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/07/08/48hours/main562214.shtml |title=Murder In Monaco: An American On Trial |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date= |accessdate=2017-02-26}}</ref> under suspicion of starting the fire, and was convicted of the crime in 2002 by the Monaco Court.

Safra Philanthropic Foundation]] carries on this work today in his memory.\n\nCommitted to his Jewish faith, he believed that constructing and renovating synagogues was important in places where there was a potential for a Jewish community to flourish, and synagogues around the world bearing his father's name testify to this commitment. Many of these were built in the world's major Jewish centers, but he also helped to build synagogues in more remote communities such as Manila and [[Kinshasa]].\n\n500 years after the last synagogue was built in [[Madrid]] he constructed a new one. He also helped to renovate and enlarge synagogues in [[Amsterdam]], [[Istanbul]], [[Naples]], [[Budapest]], [[Rhodes]], and [[Vienna]]. He saved the oldest synagogue in France, in [[Clermont-Ferrand]], from destruction by buying it for the community, and he contributed to the expansion of the [[Cannes]] synagogue and Synagogue Beth El in Paris.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bethel-net.org/|title=bethel online|website=www.bethel-net.org}}</ref> He also helped refurbish synagogues in many small French cities including [[\u00c9vian-les-Bains|\u00c9vian]], [[Annemasse]], and others. Among the synagogues is the [[Edmond J. Safra Synagogue]] in [[New York City]].\n\nIn addition to supporting a number of synagogues in [[Israel]], the tombs of [[Rabbi Meir|Rabbi Meir Baal Haness]] and [[Simeon bar Yochai|Rabbi Shimon Bar Yohai]] (2nd century CE) were especially important to him, and he was a generous supporter of these pilgrimage sites. For many years on [[Shavuot]] eve, the anniversary of his father's death, he would pray at the tomb of Rabbi Meir until dawn.\n\nDuring his lifetime Safra donated millions of dollars to provide treatment for the sick. Hospitals across the globe \u2013 the H\u00f4pital Cantonal de Gen\u00e8ve, the [[Assistance Publique \u2013 H\u00f4pitaux de Paris|H\u00f4pitaux de France]], and countless institutions in the United States, for example \u2013 benefited from his generosity. He was one of the founders of [[Albert Einstein Hospital]] in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], today one of [[South America]]\u2019s major medical centers. In [[Israel]], he initiated the construction of the Edmond and Lily Safra Children's Hospital at [[Tel Hashomer]].\n\nIn the area of medical research, he was a significant supporter of the [[Pasteur Institute|Institut Pasteur]] in Paris, the [[Weizmann Institute]] in Israel, the [[The Michael J. Fox Foundation|Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research]] and a number of different centers studying specific diseases in France, the United States, and elsewhere around the world. He created the Edmond and Lily Safra Chair in Breast Cancer Research at [[Tulane University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohr.tulane.edu/news/newwave/011508_cancer.cfm?RenderForPrint=1|title=Tulane University - Shedding New Light on Cancer Risk|website=www.ohr.tulane.edu}}</ref>\n\nSafra believed higher education was essential for every young person in the modern world, even though he himself never attended university. He provided university scholarship funds for tens of thousands of needy students through the International Sephardic Education Foundation (ISEF), an institution he and his wife established in 1977 to support deserving Israeli students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iseffoundation.org/programs/edmond-j-safra-scholarships/|title=Edmond J. Safra Scholars - ISEF Foundation - Israel Education - Israel Scholarships - Non-Profit - Israel and New York|website=iseffoundation.org}}</ref>\n\nSafra also helped universities directly, often through the support of chairs and particular programs (such as Judaic Studies). For example, at [[Harvard University]] he endowed the Jacob E. Safra Professorship of Jewish History and Sephardic Civilization, and the [[Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics]]; and he gave significant funds for the Robert F. Kennedy Visiting Professorship in Latin American Studies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ro.drclas.harvard.edu/pages/robert-f-kennedy-visiting-professorship-latin-american-studies|title=RFK Visiting Professorship in Latin American Studies|publisher=}}</ref> At the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, he created the Jacob E. Safra Professorship of International Banking and the Safra Business Research Center.\n\nHe was awarded Honorary Doctorates by the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] and [[Yeshiva University|Yeshiva University (New York)]] (where he established the Jacob E. Safra Institute of Sephardic Studies) for his ongoing support of those institutions.\n\nWith respect to younger children's education, he was especially devoted to schools in the cities where he lived \u2013 for example, he founded Ecole Girsa,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alliancegirsa.ch/notre-histoire/|title=Ecole Alliance Girsa - Ecole juive Gen\u00e8ve - Membre de l'Alliance Universelle Isra\u00e9lite|publisher=}}</ref> Geneva's first and largest Jewish school. He took great pride in founding the Beit Yaacov school in [[Bat Yam]]. He was also one of the world's most significant benefactors of yeshivot (religious schools training young men to be rabbis, Jewish teachers, and judges), assisting numerous institutions worldwide.<ref>''Aleppo: City of Scholars'', the Jack Adjmi edition, Rabbi David Sutton, 2005.</ref>\n\nIn France, the Edmond J.

Kelso is part of the [[Longview, Washington]] [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which has a population of 102,410.  Kelso shares its long western border with Longview.  It is near [[Mount St. Helens]].\n\n==History==\nThe earliest known inhabitants of Kelso were [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] from the [[Cowlitz people|Cowlitz tribe]]. The Cowlitz people were separated into the Upper (or Taidnapam) and Lower (or Mountain) Cowlitz tribes, who were members of the [[Sahaptin]] and [[Salishan languages|Salish]] language families, respectively.  In 1855,  European explorers noted that there numbered over 6000 individuals of the Cowlitz Tribe.\n\nKelso was founded by [[Peter Crawford (land surveyor)|Peter W. Crawford]], a Scottish surveyor, who, in 1847, took up the first donation land claim on the Lower [[Cowlitz River]].  Crawford platted a townsite which he named after his home town of [[Kelso, Scottish Borders|Kelso]], [[Scotland]]. The original plat was dated and filed in October 1884.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Meany |first= Edmond S. |authorlink= Edmond S.

On weekends, trainloads of loggers would come into town from the surrounding region looking for women, liquor, gambling and fights. The [[FBI]] finally forced the mayor to shut them down in the 1950s with the last tavern/brothel closing in the mid-1960s.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.tdn.com/articles/2009/05/24/top_story/doc4a177571a2f4a525663283.txt| title=Four Things That Helped Define Kelso | newspaper=The Daily News | author=Amy Fischer | date=May 24, 2009|accessdate=November 2, 2009}}</ref>  The economy continues to be based largely on wood products.\n\nIn the late 19th century and into the first part of the 20th century, Kelso was the center for commercial [[Eulachon|smelt]] fishing on the Cowlitz River.

To practice as a registered dietitian within a province, a dietitian must register with the college and obtain a license. The activities of the college are governed by legislation passed by the provincial government. It is the presence of this regulatory body which distinguishes registered dietitians from [[nutritionist]]s in Canada, the regulations for which vary by province (Exceptions: Alberta where \"Registered Nutritionist\" is a protected title that can only be used by dietitians.

Besides academic education, dietitians must complete at least 1200 hours of practical, supervised experience through an accredited program before they can sit for the registration examination. In a coordinated program, students acquire internship hours concurrently with their coursework. In a didactic program, these hours are obtained through a dietetic [[internship]] that is completed after obtaining a degree.<ref>[http://www.eatright.org/BecomeanRDorDTR/content.aspx?id=8142 Become an RD or DTR.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709095600/http://www.eatright.org/BecomeanRDorDTR/content.aspx?id=8142 |date=2012-07-09 }} Accessed 12 July 2012.</ref> In both programs the student is required to complete several areas of competency including rotations in clinical, community, long-term care nutrition as well as food service, [[public health]] and a variety of other worksites.\n\nOnce the degree is earned, the internship completed, and registration examination passed, the individual can use the nationally recognized legal title, \"Registered Dietitian\", and is able to work in a variety of professional settings.
