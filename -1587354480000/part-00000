Kennedy]]'s \"Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country\" [[Inaugural]] Address in January 1961 and after Kennedy's death in November 1963, Kovic joined the [[United States Marine Corps]] after high school in September 1964. He was sent to the [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island]], [[South Carolina]], where, after twelve weeks of intensive [[recruit training]], he was promoted to the [[United States Marine Corps enlisted rank insignia|rank]] of [[Private First Class]] and became the [[push-up]] champion of his [[battalion]]. Kovic was then sent to the [[United States Marine Corps School of Infantry|Infantry Training Regiment]] (ITR) at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune|Camp Lejeune]], [[North Carolina]], for advanced combat training. He returned home to Massapequa in December, just before Christmas. After several weeks' leave, Kovic was assigned to the Marine Corps Barracks at [[Norfolk, Virginia]], where he attended radio school and learned communication skills, including [[International Morse Code|Morse code]]. He was then assigned to the Second Field Artillery Battalion, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.\n\n==Military service in Vietnam==\nKovic volunteered to serve in Vietnam, and was sent to South Vietnam in December 1965 as a member of H&S Company, [[3rd Battalion 7th Marines|3rd Battalion, 7th Marines]], [[1st Marine Division]].

After a 13-month tour of duty, he returned home on January 15, 1967. He was subsequently assigned to the [[2nd Marine Aircraft Wing]] at [[Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point|Cherry Point]], North Carolina. Several months later, he volunteered to return to Vietnam for a second tour of duty.<ref name=gay/>\n\nHe was assigned to H&S Company, [[1st Amphibian Tractor Battalion]], 3rd Marine Division in South Vietnam. In October 1967, according to Kovic's own account, he shot and killed another Marine by accident during an NVA (North Vietnamese Army) ambush near a village along the [[Cua Viet River]].\n\nOn January 20, 1968, while leading a reconnaissance force of battalion scouts<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amtrac.org/1atbn/Chronicles/amgrunts.asp|title=AmGrunts|publisher=|accessdate=September 1, 2016}}</ref> from the 1st Amtrac Battalion just north of the Cua Viet River in the vicinity of the village of My Loc, in the [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone|Demilitarized Zone]], Kovic's squad came into contact with the NVA 803rd Regiment and elements of a [[Viet Cong]] battalion that was besieging the village; he was shot by NVA soldiers while leading his rifle squad across an open area, attempting to aid the [[South Vietnamese Popular Force]] unit in the village.

He attended his first peace demonstration soon after the [[Kent State shootings]] in May 1970, and gave his first speech against the war at Levittown Memorial High School in [[Levittown, New York|Levittown]], [[Long Island]], New York that same spring. Kovic's speech that day was interrupted by a bomb threat and the auditorium was cleared.<ref name=\"Mogk2013\"/>\n\nUndeterred, Kovic continued speaking to students from the school's football grandstands. His first arrest was during an [[anti-Vietnam War]] demonstration at an [[Orange County, California]] draft board in the spring of 1971 when he refused to leave the office of the draft board explaining to a representative that, by sending young men to Vietnam, they were inadvertently \"condemning them to their death,\" or to be wounded and maimed like himself in a war that he had come to believe was, \"immoral and made no sense.\" He was told that, if he did not leave the draft board immediately, he would be arrested. Kovic refused to leave, and was taken away by police.<ref name=gay>{{cite book|last=Gay|first=Kathlyn|title=American Dissidents: An Encyclopedia of Activists, Subversives, and Prisoners of Conscience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzQVpPvlVMcC&pg=PA362|year=2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-764-2|pages=359\u2013362}}</ref>\n\nIn 1974, Kovic led a group of disabled Vietnam War veterans in wheelchairs on a 17-day [[hunger strike]] inside the Los Angeles office of Senator [[Alan Cranston]]. The veterans protested the \"poor treatment in America's Veterans Hospitals\" and demanded better treatment for returning veterans, a full investigation of all [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] (VA) facilities, and a face-to-face meeting with head of the VA, [[Donald E. Johnson]]. The strike continued to escalate until Johnson finally agreed to fly out from Washington, D.C., and meet with the veterans. The hunger strike ended soon after that. Several months later Johnson resigned. In late August 1974, Kovic traveled to Belfast, Northern Ireland, where he spent a week in the Catholic stronghold of \"Turf Lodge,\" interviewing both political activists and residents. In the spring of 1975 Kovic, author Richard Boyle, and photo journalist Loretta Smith traveled to cover the war in Cambodia for Pacific News Service.<ref name=gay/>\n\nKovic was a speaker at the [[1976 Democratic National Convention]], seconding the nomination of draft resister [[Fritz Efaw]] for Vice President of the United States. ''Time'' magazine described the scene as one of the few poignant moments of the convention and many in the audience were brought to tears. On July 12, 1977, Kovic was arrested with 191 students and supporters during the [[Tent_city#Kent_State_University|anti-Gymnasium protests]] at Kent State University. In 1979, Ron Kovic gave a speech at The Libertarian National Convention which nominated Ed Clark for President. In 1988, Kovic was a Jesse Jackson delegate to the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1983, he published Around the World in Eight Days, a short novel about a Vietnam War veteran who wagers that he can circle the globe in eight days without the benefit of aircraft. Writing in American Book Review, Edmund Cardoni called the book \"wildly imaginative\" and noted that compared to Born on the Fourth of July, Around the World in Eight Days is \"more patently literary in the tribute it pays to the transformative power of narrative art.\"\n\nFrom 1990 to 1991, Kovic took part in several [[anti-war]] demonstrations against the first [[Gulf War]], which occurred not long after the release of his biographical film in 1989.<ref name=gay/> In early May 1999, following the U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, Kovic met with China's ambassador to the United States Li Zhaoxing at the Chinese embassy in Washington D.C. to express his most sincere condolences and present the ambassador and his staff with two dozen red roses. He was an outspoken critic of the [[Iraq War]].<ref name=gay/>\n\n===Since 2000===\nIn November 2003, Kovic joined protests in London against the visit of [[George W. Bush]]. He was the guest of honor at a reception held at London's city hall by Mayor [[Ken Livingstone]]. The following day, he led a march of several hundred thousand demonstrators on [[Trafalgar Square]], where a huge rally was held protesting the visit of George W. Bush and the war in Iraq. Kovic attended the [[2008 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Denver]], Colorado. On Sunday, August 24, 2008, the day before the convention began, Kovic spoke, then led thousands in a march against the war which ended with him saying, \"In the city of Denver, we got welcomed home.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/politics/ci_10320524|title=Denverpost.com}}</ref>\n\nIn a new introduction to his book, ''[[Born on the Fourth of July]]'' (1976), written in March 2005, Kovic stated, \"I wanted people to understand. I wanted to share with them as nakedly and openly and intimately as possible what I had gone through, what I had endured. I wanted them to know what it really meant to be in a war, to be shot and wounded, to be fighting for my life on the intensive care ward, not the myth we had grown up believing. I wanted people to know about the hospitals and the enema room, about why I had become opposed to the war, why I had grown more and more committed to peace and nonviolence. I had been beaten by the police and arrested twelve times for protesting the war and I had spent many nights in jail in my wheelchair. I had been called a [[anticommunism|Communist]] and a traitor, simply for trying to tell the truth about what had happened in that war, but I refused to be intimidated.\" In 1989, Kovic presented actor [[Tom Cruise]] (born July 3, 1962) who portrayed him in the movie ''Born On The Fourth of July,'' on the last day of filming, the original Bronze Star Medal he had received,<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/17/movies/the-private-war-of-tom-cruise.html|title=The Private War of Tom Cruise|first=PAUL CHUTKOW; Paul Chutkow is a California-based|last=freelance|date=December 17, 1989|publisher=|accessdate=December 20, 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> explaining to Cruise that he was giving him the medal as a gift <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0468407/bio|title=Ron Kovic|website=IMDb|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}</ref> \"for his heroic performance.\"<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine reported that [[Oliver Stone]] said, \"He gave it to Tom for bravery for having gone through this experience in hell as much as any person can without actually having been there.\"\n\nIn March 2007, Kovic checked into the [[Ernest Bors]] Spinal Cord Injury ward of the Veterans Administration Hospital in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], California, for an undisclosed illness.\n\nOn January 20, 2008, Kovic observed his 40th anniversary of having been shot and paralyzed in the Vietnam War. Kovic, in March 2005, said: \"The scar will always be there, a living reminder of that war, but it has also become something beautiful now, something of faith and hope and love. I have been given the opportunity to move through that dark night of the soul to a new shore, to gain an understanding, a knowledge, and entirely different vision. I now believe I have suffered for a reason and in many ways I have found that reason in my commitment to peace and nonviolence. My life has been a blessing in disguise, even with the pain and great difficulty that my physical disability continues to bring. It is a blessing to speak on behalf of peace, to be able to reach such a great number of people.\"\n\nOn April 8, 2009, Kovic joined British MP [[George Galloway]] to launch Viva Palestina USA, an American branch of [[Viva Palestina]]. Kovic planned to co-lead with Galloway a humanitarian relief convoy to the Gaza Strip in early July 2009. On December 6, 2009 Kovic spoke honoring [[Bruce Springsteen]] at the 32nd annual [[Kennedy Center Honors]] in Washington, D.C. On December 22, 2009, Kovic, [[Oliver Stone]], and friends celebrated the 20th anniversary of the 1989 film release of ''Born on the Fourth of July'' at a dinner party in Torrance, California. In April 2010, Kovic traveled to Rome, Italy, as a member of the Council for Dignity, Forgiveness, and Reconciliation. Between April 19\u201326, he attended meetings at Rome's City Hall with other international peace activists, diplomats and academics, to discuss the need for conflict resolution and other more peaceful, nonviolent alternatives to war as a way of solving the world's many conflicts. On April 21, 2010, he spoke of his journey from war to peace, forgiveness, and reconciliation before Rome's mayor, [[Gianni Alemanno]], and other civic leaders at Rome's [[Ara Pacis]] (Altar of Augustan Peace), commissioned by the Roman Senate on July 4, 13 BC.\n\nOn July 4, 2016 [[Akashic Books]] published the 40th anniversary edition of ''Born on the Fourth of July'', with a foreword by [[Bruce Springsteen]], in conjunction with Kovic's latest book, ''Hurricane Street''. Naming it a Top 10 Pick for Spring 2016, [[Publishers Weekly]] reported, \"The author of the bestseller ''Born on the Fourth of July'' writes an impassioned and timely memoir about the 1974 American Veterans Movement that will strike a chord with veterans and their families today.\" Despite its creator's fatalism, \"Born On the Fourth of July\" has left ripples. Stone expressed great admiration for Kovic, praising him for affecting change in America's VA hospitals, and actively protesting both Gulf Wars. \"He's one of the strongest men I've ever met in my life,\" Stone said. \"I don't know how he's able to go through what he does every day.\" Born on the Fourth of July received a National Book Award nomination.\n\nKovic lives in [[Redondo Beach, California]], where he writes, paints, plays the piano, and gardens.

He was sent to the [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island]], [[South Carolina]], where, after twelve weeks of intensive [[recruit training]], he was promoted to the [[United States Marine Corps enlisted rank insignia|rank]] of [[Private First Class]] and became the [[push-up]] champion of his [[battalion]]. Kovic was then sent to the [[United States Marine Corps School of Infantry|Infantry Training Regiment]] (ITR) at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune|Camp Lejeune]], [[North Carolina]], for advanced combat training. He returned home to Massapequa in December, just before Christmas. After several weeks' leave, Kovic was assigned to the Marine Corps Barracks at [[Norfolk, Virginia]], where he attended radio school and learned communication skills, including [[International Morse Code|Morse code]]. He was then assigned to the Second Field Artillery Battalion, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.\n\n==Military service in Vietnam==\nKovic volunteered to serve in Vietnam, and was sent to South Vietnam in December 1965 as a member of H&S Company, [[3rd Battalion 7th Marines|3rd Battalion, 7th Marines]], [[1st Marine Division]]. In June 1966, he was transferred to Bravo Company, Second Platoon, [[1st Reconnaissance Battalion]], 1st Marine Division<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2209&dat=19900211&id=Po5KAAAAIBAJ&sjid=M5QMAAAAIBAJ&pg=6790,2162732&hl=en|title=The Telegraph - Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=September 1, 2016}}</ref> where he participated in 22 [[Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol]]s in enemy territory. After a 13-month tour of duty, he returned home on January 15, 1967. He was subsequently assigned to the [[2nd Marine Aircraft Wing]] at [[Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point|Cherry Point]], North Carolina. Several months later, he volunteered to return to Vietnam for a second tour of duty.<ref name=gay/>\n\nHe was assigned to H&S Company, [[1st Amphibian Tractor Battalion]], 3rd Marine Division in South Vietnam. In October 1967, according to Kovic's own account, he shot and killed another Marine by accident during an NVA (North Vietnamese Army) ambush near a village along the [[Cua Viet River]].\n\nOn January 20, 1968, while leading a reconnaissance force of battalion scouts<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amtrac.org/1atbn/Chronicles/amgrunts.asp|title=AmGrunts|publisher=|accessdate=September 1, 2016}}</ref> from the 1st Amtrac Battalion just north of the Cua Viet River in the vicinity of the village of My Loc, in the [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone|Demilitarized Zone]], Kovic's squad came into contact with the NVA 803rd Regiment and elements of a [[Viet Cong]] battalion that was besieging the village; he was shot by NVA soldiers while leading his rifle squad across an open area, attempting to aid the [[South Vietnamese Popular Force]] unit in the village.

Kovic then spent a week in an [[intensive care]] ward in [[Da Nang]]. As a result of his service and injuries in the conflict, Kovic was awarded the [[Bronze Star Medal]] with [[Combat \"V\"]] for heroism in battle and the [[Purple Heart Medal]].<ref name=\"Moss1994\">{{cite book|last=Moss|first=Nathaniel|title=Ron Kovic: Antiwar Activist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nhqcsFFSu3wC|year=1994|publisher=Chelsea House Publishers|isbn=978-0-7910-2076-0|page=55}}</ref>\n\n==Post-Vietnam activism==\n[[File:Ron Kovic and Vietnam Veteran protestors at the 1972 Republican National Convention - Miami, Florida (cropped1).jpg|thumb|right|Kovic protesting the [[1972 Republican National Convention]]]]\nBefore the end of the war in Vietnam was declared on April 30, 1975, Kovic became one of the best-known [[peace activist]]s among the Vietnam [[veteran]]s, and was arrested 12 times for political protesting. He attended his first peace demonstration soon after the [[Kent State shootings]] in May 1970, and gave his first speech against the war at Levittown Memorial High School in [[Levittown, New York|Levittown]], [[Long Island]], New York that same spring. Kovic's speech that day was interrupted by a bomb threat and the auditorium was cleared.<ref name=\"Mogk2013\"/>\n\nUndeterred, Kovic continued speaking to students from the school's football grandstands. His first arrest was during an [[anti-Vietnam War]] demonstration at an [[Orange County, California]] draft board in the spring of 1971 when he refused to leave the office of the draft board explaining to a representative that, by sending young men to Vietnam, they were inadvertently \"condemning them to their death,\" or to be wounded and maimed like himself in a war that he had come to believe was, \"immoral and made no sense.\" He was told that, if he did not leave the draft board immediately, he would be arrested. Kovic refused to leave, and was taken away by police.<ref name=gay>{{cite book|last=Gay|first=Kathlyn|title=American Dissidents: An Encyclopedia of Activists, Subversives, and Prisoners of Conscience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzQVpPvlVMcC&pg=PA362|year=2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-764-2|pages=359\u2013362}}</ref>\n\nIn 1974, Kovic led a group of disabled Vietnam War veterans in wheelchairs on a 17-day [[hunger strike]] inside the Los Angeles office of Senator [[Alan Cranston]]. The veterans protested the \"poor treatment in America's Veterans Hospitals\" and demanded better treatment for returning veterans, a full investigation of all [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] (VA) facilities, and a face-to-face meeting with head of the VA, [[Donald E. Johnson]]. The strike continued to escalate until Johnson finally agreed to fly out from Washington, D.C., and meet with the veterans. The hunger strike ended soon after that. Several months later Johnson resigned. In late August 1974, Kovic traveled to Belfast, Northern Ireland, where he spent a week in the Catholic stronghold of \"Turf Lodge,\" interviewing both political activists and residents. In the spring of 1975 Kovic, author Richard Boyle, and photo journalist Loretta Smith traveled to cover the war in Cambodia for Pacific News Service.<ref name=gay/>\n\nKovic was a speaker at the [[1976 Democratic National Convention]], seconding the nomination of draft resister [[Fritz Efaw]] for Vice President of the United States. ''Time'' magazine described the scene as one of the few poignant moments of the convention and many in the audience were brought to tears. On July 12, 1977, Kovic was arrested with 191 students and supporters during the [[Tent_city#Kent_State_University|anti-Gymnasium protests]] at Kent State University. In 1979, Ron Kovic gave a speech at The Libertarian National Convention which nominated Ed Clark for President. In 1988, Kovic was a Jesse Jackson delegate to the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1983, he published Around the World in Eight Days, a short novel about a Vietnam War veteran who wagers that he can circle the globe in eight days without the benefit of aircraft. Writing in American Book Review, Edmund Cardoni called the book \"wildly imaginative\" and noted that compared to Born on the Fourth of July, Around the World in Eight Days is \"more patently literary in the tribute it pays to the transformative power of narrative art.\"\n\nFrom 1990 to 1991, Kovic took part in several [[anti-war]] demonstrations against the first [[Gulf War]], which occurred not long after the release of his biographical film in 1989.<ref name=gay/> In early May 1999, following the U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, Kovic met with China's ambassador to the United States Li Zhaoxing at the Chinese embassy in Washington D.C. to express his most sincere condolences and present the ambassador and his staff with two dozen red roses. He was an outspoken critic of the [[Iraq War]].<ref name=gay/>\n\n===Since 2000===\nIn November 2003, Kovic joined protests in London against the visit of [[George W. Bush]]. He was the guest of honor at a reception held at London's city hall by Mayor [[Ken Livingstone]]. The following day, he led a march of several hundred thousand demonstrators on [[Trafalgar Square]], where a huge rally was held protesting the visit of George W. Bush and the war in Iraq. Kovic attended the [[2008 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Denver]], Colorado. On Sunday, August 24, 2008, the day before the convention began, Kovic spoke, then led thousands in a march against the war which ended with him saying, \"In the city of Denver, we got welcomed home.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/politics/ci_10320524|title=Denverpost.com}}</ref>\n\nIn a new introduction to his book, ''[[Born on the Fourth of July]]'' (1976), written in March 2005, Kovic stated, \"I wanted people to understand. I wanted to share with them as nakedly and openly and intimately as possible what I had gone through, what I had endured. I wanted them to know what it really meant to be in a war, to be shot and wounded, to be fighting for my life on the intensive care ward, not the myth we had grown up believing. I wanted people to know about the hospitals and the enema room, about why I had become opposed to the war, why I had grown more and more committed to peace and nonviolence. I had been beaten by the police and arrested twelve times for protesting the war and I had spent many nights in jail in my wheelchair. I had been called a [[anticommunism|Communist]] and a traitor, simply for trying to tell the truth about what had happened in that war, but I refused to be intimidated.\" In 1989, Kovic presented actor [[Tom Cruise]] (born July 3, 1962) who portrayed him in the movie ''Born On The Fourth of July,'' on the last day of filming, the original Bronze Star Medal he had received,<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/17/movies/the-private-war-of-tom-cruise.html|title=The Private War of Tom Cruise|first=PAUL CHUTKOW; Paul Chutkow is a California-based|last=freelance|date=December 17, 1989|publisher=|accessdate=December 20, 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> explaining to Cruise that he was giving him the medal as a gift <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0468407/bio|title=Ron Kovic|website=IMDb|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}</ref> \"for his heroic performance.\"<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine reported that [[Oliver Stone]] said, \"He gave it to Tom for bravery for having gone through this experience in hell as much as any person can without actually having been there.\"\n\nIn March 2007, Kovic checked into the [[Ernest Bors]] Spinal Cord Injury ward of the Veterans Administration Hospital in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], California, for an undisclosed illness.\n\nOn January 20, 2008, Kovic observed his 40th anniversary of having been shot and paralyzed in the Vietnam War. Kovic, in March 2005, said: \"The scar will always be there, a living reminder of that war, but it has also become something beautiful now, something of faith and hope and love. I have been given the opportunity to move through that dark night of the soul to a new shore, to gain an understanding, a knowledge, and entirely different vision. I now believe I have suffered for a reason and in many ways I have found that reason in my commitment to peace and nonviolence. My life has been a blessing in disguise, even with the pain and great difficulty that my physical disability continues to bring. It is a blessing to speak on behalf of peace, to be able to reach such a great number of people.\"\n\nOn April 8, 2009, Kovic joined British MP [[George Galloway]] to launch Viva Palestina USA, an American branch of [[Viva Palestina]]. Kovic planned to co-lead with Galloway a humanitarian relief convoy to the Gaza Strip in early July 2009. On December 6, 2009 Kovic spoke honoring [[Bruce Springsteen]] at the 32nd annual [[Kennedy Center Honors]] in Washington, D.C. On December 22, 2009, Kovic, [[Oliver Stone]], and friends celebrated the 20th anniversary of the 1989 film release of ''Born on the Fourth of July'' at a dinner party in Torrance, California. In April 2010, Kovic traveled to Rome, Italy, as a member of the Council for Dignity, Forgiveness, and Reconciliation. Between April 19\u201326, he attended meetings at Rome's City Hall with other international peace activists, diplomats and academics, to discuss the need for conflict resolution and other more peaceful, nonviolent alternatives to war as a way of solving the world's many conflicts. On April 21, 2010, he spoke of his journey from war to peace, forgiveness, and reconciliation before Rome's mayor, [[Gianni Alemanno]], and other civic leaders at Rome's [[Ara Pacis]] (Altar of Augustan Peace), commissioned by the Roman Senate on July 4, 13 BC.\n\nOn July 4, 2016 [[Akashic Books]] published the 40th anniversary edition of ''Born on the Fourth of July'', with a foreword by [[Bruce Springsteen]], in conjunction with Kovic's latest book, ''Hurricane Street''. Naming it a Top 10 Pick for Spring 2016, [[Publishers Weekly]] reported, \"The author of the bestseller ''Born on the Fourth of July'' writes an impassioned and timely memoir about the 1974 American Veterans Movement that will strike a chord with veterans and their families today.\" Despite its creator's fatalism, \"Born On the Fourth of July\" has left ripples. Stone expressed great admiration for Kovic, praising him for affecting change in America's VA hospitals, and actively protesting both Gulf Wars. \"He's one of the strongest men I've ever met in my life,\" Stone said. \"I don't know how he's able to go through what he does every day.\" Born on the Fourth of July received a National Book Award nomination.\n\nKovic lives in [[Redondo Beach, California]], where he writes, paints, plays the piano, and gardens. He has never married, although he did have a relationship with Connie Panzarino (author of ''The Me in the Mirror'').<ref name=\"People Magazine\">{{cite book|last=People|first=Magazine|title=Ron Kovic: A Crippled Vet Born on the Fourth of July Is a New Breed of Yankee Doodle Dandy|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20067273,00.html}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Bruce Springsteen]] wrote the song \"[[Shut Out the Light]]\" after reading Kovic's memoir and then meeting him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/bookmark/bruce-springsteen-gives-born-fourth-907432 |title= Bruce Springsteen Gives 'Born on the Fourth of July' New Foreword (Audio)|last1= Lewis|first1= Andy|date= July 1, 2016|website= www.HollywoodReporter.com|publisher= The Hollywood Reporter|access-date= October 25, 2016|quote=Springsteen and Kovic have been friendly for more than 30 years and the B-side song on the \"Born in the USA\" single, \"Shut Out the Light,\" was written by the Boss about Kovic.}}</ref> [[Tom Paxton]], the folk singer/political activist, wrote the song \"Born on the Fourth of July\", which is on his 1977 ''New Songs from the Briarpatch'' album, and met Kovic backstage at the Bottom Line Club in New York City the same year.\n\n==Personal life==\nKovic is the uncle of internet personality [[Adam Kovic]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Funhaus|title=Hottest Men In Hollywood - Dude Soup Podcast #219|date=2019-03-28|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jheil4TrKKE&t=107|access-date=2019-03-29}}</ref>\n\n==Films==\n[[File:Ron Kovic (2105823755).jpg|thumb|right|Kovic in 1990 at the [[62nd Academy Awards]]]]\n*1973 \u2013 ''Operation Last Patrol''.

As an apology, God allows him to be resurrected, but since he cannot send him back to his old world, he instead reincarnates him into a fantasy world along with a single special request. Touya uses his request in order to bring his smartphone into the new world with him, which God modifies. As such, while Touya cannot contact his old world with it, the phone can be easily recharged by magic and can otherwise function such as accessing data from the old world and can use relevant features for his new world such as the GPS function to locations which are comprehensively identified on it.\n\nGod also greatly amplifies Touya's physical, magical, and cognitive abilities to a certain degree as a further apology for the inconvenience of killing him.

As an apology, God allows him to be resurrected, but since he cannot send him back to his old world, he instead reincarnates him into a fantasy world along with a single special request. Touya uses his request in order to bring his smartphone into the new world with him, which God modifies. As such, while Touya cannot contact his old world with it, the phone can be easily recharged by magic and can otherwise function such as accessing data from the old world and can use relevant features for his new world such as the GPS function to locations which are comprehensively identified on it.\n\nGod also greatly amplifies Touya's physical, magical, and cognitive abilities to a certain degree as a further apology for the inconvenience of killing him. Taking full advantage of his second chance at life, Touya befriends many different people, mainly females and high-ranking people in the new world. He begins to travel from country to country, solving political disputes, minor quests, and nonchalantly enjoying himself with his newfound allies.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{Nihongo|Touya Mochizuki|\u671b\u6708\u51ac\u591c|Mochizuki T\u014dya}}\n:{{Voiced by|Katsumi Fukuhara<ref name=\"JulyPremiere\"/>|[[Josh Grelle]]<ref name=\"Dub cast\">{{cite web|url=https://www.funimation.com/blog/2017/07/13/summer-2017-simuldubs-funimationnow/|title=Summer 2017 SimulDubs on FunimationNow!|website=Funimation|date=July 13, 2017|accessdate=March 6, 2019}}</ref>}}\n:A fifteen-year-old from Earth, reborn by God into the other world as a way of apology for the latter's mistake of killing him.
