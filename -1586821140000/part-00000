{"title_page": "Charles Porter (Lord Chancellor of Ireland)", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=October 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\n'''Sir Charles Porter''' (6 September 1631 \u2013 8 December 1696<ref>{{ODNB |first=C. I. |last=McGrath |title=Porter, Sir Charles |id=22560}}</ref>), was a flamboyant and somewhat controversial English-born  politician and judge,  who  nonetheless enjoyed  a highly successful career.\n\nHe sat in the [[English House of Commons]], and was  twice [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]]. As Chancellor,  he  survived  an  attempt by his political enemies to impeach him, and      defeated attempts  to persuade the [[English Crown]]  to remove him from office. In the last months of his life he was effectively head of the Irish government. In  his  dealings with the Irish people  he  was noted for tolerance in religious matters.\n\nHe  was   a  heavy drinker  and  was chronically short of money. Nonetheless as  a lawyer he  was considered  to be entirely honest, and  he died  a poor man.  Although he had his critics, he was   described  by his friends as \"a man who had the good  fortune to be universally beloved\".\n\n== Early life ==\nPorter was born in [[Norwich]], a younger son of Edmund Porter, [[prebendary]] of Norwich and chaplain to [[Thomas Coventry, 1st Baron Coventry]].<ref>{{cite DNB |last==Bagwell |first=Richard  |title=Charles Porter |volume=46 |page=170}}</ref> Much of what we know of his early life comes from his own colourful later  account, given to his friend Roger North, which North believed to be  largely true.<ref>DNB</ref> During the [[Second English Civil War]],  while  he was an [[apprentice]], he took part on the [[Royalist]] side in the serious rioting in Norwich in 1648. He was pursued by a troop of Parliamentary  soldiers, and  escaped by seizing a child and pretending to carry it to safety. He fled to [[Great Yarmouth|Yarmouth]] and took ship for [[Amsterdam]]; there he first trained as a soldier, then ran a tavern.<ref>Ball, F. Elrington  ''The Judges in Ireland 1221\u20131921''  John Murray London 1926</ref> After about five years he judged it safe to return home.\n\nHe decided on a career in the law, entered [[Middle Temple]] in 1656 and was [[called to the Bar]] in 1663. His critics said that he was a poor lawyer, and his addiction to all forms of pleasure, especially drink, undoubtedly hampered  his practice.<ref>DNB</ref> On the other hand, he was a hard worker, had a good knowledge of  legal procedures and was a superb orator. Early in his career he acquired the reputation of a man who had \"the courage of his convictions\". As counsel in ''Crispe v Dalmahoy'' <ref>State Trials Vol. VII p.458</ref> (1675), one of several controversial cases on the claims of both [[Houses of Parliament]] to act as judges, Porter insisted on his right to argue against the  alleged judicial powers of the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]], even on pain of imprisonment for contempt of Parliament.<ref>O'Flanagan J. Roderick  ''Lives of the Lord Chancellors of Ireland''  London 1870</ref> He attracted the favourable notice of several judges, especially [[Francis North, 1st Baron Guildford]], who  became a close friend of Porter and described him as \"a man who had the good fortune to be universally loved\".<ref>See the sketch of Porter's character  in Lord Braybrooke's edition of the [[Diary of Samuel Pepys]]</ref> During the last years of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], with Guildford, now [[Lord Keeper of the Great Seal]],  at the head of the judiciary, Porter was at the height of his professional success, and entered Parliament as member for [[Tregony (UK Parliament constituency)|Tregony]] in 1685.\n\n== Lord Chancellor of Ireland ==\nEver since the [[Restoration of Charles II|Restoration of 1660]] there had been great difficulty in finding a suitable Irish Lord Chancellor: [[Michael Boyle (archbishop of Armagh)|Michael Boyle]], [[Archbishop of Armagh]], held the office for twenty years simply because no professional judge was prepared to do so. Boyle, despite his lack of legal training,  was a conscientious and incorruptible judge,  but in old age his mental and physical powers  undoubtedly declined.\nDespite the objections of the Lord Lieutenant, [[Henry Hyde, 2nd Earl of Clarendon]], who was  a good friend of Boyle,<ref>O'Flanagan  ''Lives of the Chancellors''</ref> it was decided to replace him with Porter, who was [[knighted]]  and appointed  Lord Chancellor in April 1686. Clarendon, despite his initial objections to his appointment,  quickly came to like and admire Porter, whom he described as that rarest of beings, an honest lawyer.\n\nPorter soon found himself in difficulty on the issue of religion: as his later career would show he was by no means  hostile to [[Roman Catholics]], and was indeed  in favour of a considerable degree of [[religious toleration]] for members of that faith. When the King first confided to  Porter  his plan to admit Catholics to public office, he did not  object  to the policy of allowing  the admission of a limited number of Catholics  into  the Government.<ref>Kenyon, J.P.  ''Robert Spencer, 1st Earl of Sunderland 1641\u20131702''  Longmans  Greene 1958 Reissued 1992 p.130</ref> Porter appears to have been the only member of the Dublin administration in whom the King confided, which suggests that James initially trusted him.<ref>Kenyon p.130</ref> However Porter   strongly objected to the policy of wholesale replacement of Protestant office-holders by Catholics, and  this rapidly undermined his credit with [[James II of England|James II]]. Porter   quarreled violently with  the [[Duke of Tyrconnel]],  the effective leader of the Irish Catholics, and soon to be [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]]. Tyrconnel,  true to his nickname of  \"Lying Dick Talbot\", falsely accused  him  taking bribes,<ref>Kenyon  p.136</ref> and  he was dismissed from office  early in 1687, much  to the regret of the Irish public.<ref>O'Flanagan</ref> He demanded an interview with the King, which James  grudgingly granted, and demanded to know the reason for his dismissal.  James would reply only that it was entirely his own fault.<ref>DNB</ref>\n\nHe returned to  his practice at the Bar  in England, but he did not flourish, and was said to have been reduced to  a condition of near poverty. His  fortunes were restored by the [[Glorious Revolution|Revolution of 1688]], of which he was an early and strong supporter. He was appointed [[King's Counsel]]; entered the House of Commons as member for [[Windsor (UK Parliament constituency)|Windsor]] in 1690, and late that year, after William III had overcome his opponents in Ireland,  was reappointed Lord Chancellor of Ireland.\n\n== Second term ==\nHis second term as Chancellor,  like his first,  was  plagued with political controversy; ironically, having been removed from office for  showing a lack of favour to  Roman Catholics, he was now accused of excessive sympathy to their cause. In his capacity as [[Lord Justice of Ireland]] he signed the [[Treaty of Limerick]], which gave  generous terms of surrender to the defeated Catholic supporters of James II, promising  them [[religious tolerance]], security of property and a general [[pardon]].  Porter was determined to secure  observance of the  terms of the Treaty, so far as possible. This brought him into conflict with most other members of the Dublin administration, although he had a strong  ally  in [[Sir Richard Cox, 1st Baronet|Sir Richard Cox]], himself a future Lord Chancellor.  The conflict intensified after the appointment of [[Henry Capel, 1st Baron Capel|Lord Capel]] as Lord Deputy. Porter's opponents were determined to have him removed, the  great difficulty being that King [[William III of England|William III]] thought well of him. In 1693 he was charged with maladministration before the English  House of Commons. Being still a member of the House, he attended the hearing  in person and secured a favourable verdict.<ref>Ball ''Judges in Ireland''</ref>\n\n== Impeachment ==\nHis enemies returned to the attack in 1695 when he was [[impeached]]   by the [[Irish House of Commons]] for [[high crimes and misdemeanours]]; the articles, while including a reference to [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] sympathies,  chiefly concerned his conduct as a judge and listed a series of alleged acts of [[corruption]]   and [[abuse of office]]. Porter was permitted to speak in his own defence.  His speech was generally  agreed to have been a masterpiece:  unfortunately no copy  of it survives. We  know that Porter, who prided himself on his magnanimity,  promised to bear no malice against his accusers.  The  House of Commons rejected the charges by a large majority.<ref>O'Flanagan</ref> Why the impeachment was brought in the first place remains something of a mystery. Suspicion naturally pointed to Capel, the Lord Deputy, who was certainly no friend of Porter's. Capel however denied that he had any part in it, and it has been argued in his defence that stirring up trouble in this way would have done him no favours with the King, who admired Porter.<ref>Hayton, David \"Ruling Ireland 1685\u20131742 Politics, Politicians and Parties\" Boydell Press 2004 p.57</ref>\n\n== Last years ==\nOn the night of his acquittal, Porter became involved in an  altercation with [[Robert Rochfort]], the Speaker of the House of Commons, a political opponent, who was evidently furious at the failure of the impeachment.  Seeing the Chancellor's coach trying to pull ahead of his own,  Rochfort,  who had a great sense of his own dignity, jumped down and tried to physically prevent Porter's  coachman from going ahead of him. Porter sensibly stayed out of this quarrel, but the following day at his request the Lords sent a protest to the Commons, who replied that no insult had been intended, and that indeed the night was so dark that Rochfort had not recognised Porter (the streets of Dublin  then were notoriously dark and badly lit).<ref>''Judges in Ireland''</ref>\n\nPorter tried so far as possible to counter what he regarded as Capel's aggressively [[Protestant]] policy. On the other hand, as regards appointments to high office,  there were arguments on both sides of the question, since it seems that Porter, no less than Capel, was  anxious to secure as many  important offices  as possible for his friends  and relatives.<ref>Hart, A.R.   ''History of the King's Serjeants-at-law in Ireland''  Four Courts Press   Dublin 2000</ref> In 1695 Porter told Capel that he \"could not bear it\" if [[ William Neave]],  the MP for [[Tulsk (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Tulsk]],  a  bitter political enemy who had been active in the impeachment proceedings,  were appointed Second [[Serjeant-at-law (Ireland)|Serjeant]]. Capel sharply retorted that he had allowed Porter to nominate his own protege, Sir [[Thomas Pakenham (Augher MP)|Thomas Pakenham]],  as Prime Serjeant, as well as allowing Porter's own brother William  to [[take silk]].  As regards Neave's role in  the impeachment, Capel urged Porter, normally a magnanimous man, to forgive and forget, as he had already promised to  do in his speech in his own defence.  Neave was duly appointed  Serjeant despite  Porter's protests.<ref>Hart  ''Irish Serjeants-at-law''</ref>\n\nOn Capel's death in the spring of 1696, Porter,  appointed again as Lord Justice, was briefly at the head of the Irish administration: but on 8 December 1696, on  returning to his chambers after  leaving Court, he  collapsed and died suddenly of a stroke.<ref>''Judges in Ireland''</ref>\n\n== Family ==\nPorter married twice, but almost nothing is known about either  of his wives. He  had three children:\n*Frederick, who married his cousin Mary Porter, but had no children.\n*Elizabeth, who married firstly Edward Devenish, and then Rev  John Moore, fourth  son of Henry, 3rd  [[Earl of Drogheda]] and had issue by both marriages.\n*Letitia, who married George Macartney; the celebrated statesman [[George Macartney, 1st Earl Macartney]], was their grandson.\n\nHis brother William followed him to Ireland, was called to the [[Irish Bar]]  and became [[King's Counsel]]  in 1695.<ref>Hart  ''Irish Serjeants-at-law''</ref> They had at least  one sister Elsie, who married John Miller. They were the ancestors of the [[Miller Baronets]]  of County Clare.<ref>''Burke's Peerage'' 5th Edition LOndon 1838</ref>\n\nFour years after Porter's death, Parliament passed a motion to protect the property rights of his children. This seems to confirm the general belief that Porter died in a condition of considerable poverty.<ref>''Journal of the House of Commons'' Volume 9</ref>\n\n== Character ==\nPorter's strong opinions and refusal to compromise on his principles  made him numerous  enemies in the political sphere; yet in private life, according to Lord Guildford,  he was universally loved  as a man who was witty, generous and magnanimous. His antipathy to William Neave caused some adverse  comment  on  a man normally very willing to forgive his  political enemies. His fondness for drink undoubtedly damaged his career. However, on the whole he was a success as  Lord Chancellor of Ireland - despite criticisms from his English counterpart, [[John Somers, 1st Baron Somers]], who wrote brutally that his death was a blessing for all concerned.<ref>DNB</ref> William III, who normally regarded his Ministers  with a  complete lack of human emotion, went so far as to say on Porter's death   that he \"was sorry for the loss of a good Chancellor\". Despite his  chronic need of money he prided himself on not taking bribes. The second Earl of Clarendon, who had a very  low opinion of the legal  profession in general,  said that Porter  and their mutual friend  [[Roger North (biographer)|Roger North]]  were  \"the only two honest lawyers I ever knew\".<ref>''Lives of the Chancellors''</ref> North himself praised Porter's many good qualities, including magnaminity, self-control and the cheerfulness with which he endured misfortune.<ref>DNB</ref>\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Michael Boyle (archbishop of Armagh)|Archbishop Michael Boyle]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]]|years=1686\u20131687}}\n{{s-aft|after= Sir [[Alexander Fitton]]}}\n{{s-bef|before=In commission\nTitle last held by Sir [[Alexander Fitton]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]]|years=1690\u20131696}}\n{{s-aft|after=In commission\nTitle next held by [[John Methuen (diplomat)|John Methuen]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Porter, Charles}}\n[[Category:Lord Chancellors of Ireland]]\n[[Category:1631 births]]\n[[Category:1696 deaths]]\n[[Category:Members of the Privy Council of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Members of the pre-1707 English Parliament for constituencies in Cornwall]]\n[[Category:English MPs 1685\u20131687]]\n[[Category:English MPs 1690\u20131695]]\n[[Category:Members of the Middle Temple]]\n[[Category:People from Norwich]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=October 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\n'''Sir Charles Porter''' (6 September 1631 \u2013 8 December 1696<ref>{{ODNB |first=C. I. |last=McGrath |title=Porter, Sir Charles |id=22560}}</ref>), was a flamboyant and somewhat controversial English-born  politician and judge,  who  nonetheless enjoyed  a highly successful career.\n\nHe sat in the [[English House of Commons]], and was  twice [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]]. As Chancellor,  he  survived  an  attempt by his political enemies to impeach him, and      defeated attempts  to persuade the [[English Crown]]  to remove him from office. In the last months of his life he was effectively head of the Irish government. In  his  dealings with the Irish people  he  was noted for tolerance in religious matters.\n\nHe  was   a  heavy drinker  and  was chronically short of money. Nonetheless as  a lawyer he  was considered  to be entirely honest, and  he died  a poor man.  Although he had his critics, he was   described  by his friends as \"a man who had the good  fortune to be universally beloved\".\n\n== Early life ==\nPorter was born in [[Norwich]], a younger son of Edmund Porter, [[prebendary]] of Norwich and chaplain to [[Thomas Coventry, 1st Baron Coventry]].<ref>{{cite DNB |last==Bagwell |first=Richard  |title=Charles Porter |volume=46 |page=170}}</ref> Much of what we know of his early life comes from his own colourful later  account, given to his friend Roger North, which North believed to be  largely true.<ref>DNB</ref> During the [[Second English Civil War]],  while  he was an [[apprentice]], he took part on the [[Royalist]] side in the serious rioting in Norwich in 1648. He was pursued by a troop of Parliamentary  soldiers, and  escaped by seizing a child and pretending to carry it to safety. He fled to [[Great Yarmouth|Yarmouth]] and took ship for [[Amsterdam]]; there he first trained as a soldier, then ran a tavern.<ref>Ball, F. Elrington  ''The Judges in Ireland 1221\u20131921''  John Murray London 1926</ref> After about five years he judged it safe to return home.\n\nHe decided on a career in the law, entered [[Middle Temple]] in 1656 and was [[called to the Bar]] in 1663. His critics said that he was a poor lawyer, and his addiction to all forms of pleasure, especially drink, undoubtedly hampered  his practice.<ref>DNB</ref> On the other hand, he was a hard worker, had a good knowledge of  legal procedures and was a superb orator. Early in his career he acquired the reputation of a man who had \"the courage of his convictions\". As counsel in ''Crispe v Dalmahoy'' <ref>State Trials Vol. VII p.458</ref> (1675), one of several controversial cases on the claims of both [[Houses of Parliament]] to act as judges, Porter insisted on his right to argue against the  alleged judicial powers of the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]], even on pain of imprisonment for contempt of Parliament.<ref>O'Flanagan J. Roderick  ''Lives of the Lord Chancellors of Ireland''  London 1870</ref> He attracted the favourable notice of several judges, especially [[Francis North, 1st Baron Guildford]], who  became a close friend of Porter and described him as \"a man who had the good fortune to be universally loved\".<ref>See the sketch of Porter's character  in Lord Braybrooke's edition of the [[Diary of Samuel Pepys]]</ref> During the last years of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], with Guildford, now [[Lord Keeper of the Great Seal]],  at the head of the judiciary, Porter was at the height of his professional success, and entered Parliament as member for [[Tregony (UK Parliament constituency)|Tregony]] in 1685.\n\n== Lord Chancellor of Ireland ==\nEver since the [[Restoration of Charles II|Restoration of 1660]] there had been great difficulty in finding a suitable Irish Lord Chancellor: [[Michael Boyle (archbishop of Armagh)|Michael Boyle]], [[Archbishop of Armagh]], held the office for twenty years simply because no professional judge was prepared to do so. Boyle, despite his lack of legal training,  was a conscientious and incorruptible judge,  but in old age his mental and physical powers  undoubtedly declined.\nDespite the objections of the Lord Lieutenant, [[Henry Hyde, 2nd Earl of Clarendon]], who was  a good friend of Boyle,<ref>O'Flanagan  ''Lives of the Chancellors''</ref> it was decided to replace him with Porter, who was [[knighted]]  and appointed  Lord Chancellor in April 1686. Clarendon, despite his initial objections to his appointment,  quickly came to like and admire Porter, whom he described as that rarest of beings, an honest lawyer.\n\nPorter soon found himself in difficulty on the issue of religion: as his later career would show he was by no means  hostile to [[Roman Catholics]], and was indeed  in favour of a considerable degree of [[religious toleration]] for members of that faith. When the King first confided to  Porter  his plan to admit Catholics to public office, he did not  object  to the policy of allowing  the admission of a limited number of Catholics  into  the Government.<ref>Kenyon, J.P.  ''Robert Spencer, 1st Earl of Sunderland 1641\u20131702''  Longmans  Greene 1958 Reissued 1992 p.130</ref> Porter appears to have been the only member of the Dublin administration in whom the King confided, which suggests that James initially trusted him.<ref>Kenyon p.130</ref> However Porter   strongly objected to the policy of wholesale replacement of Protestant office-holders by Catholics, and  this rapidly undermined his credit with [[James II of England|James II]]. Porter   quarreled violently with  the [[Duke of Tyrconnel]],  the effective leader of the Irish Catholics, and soon to be [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]]. Tyrconnel,  true to his nickname of  \"Lying Dick Talbot\", falsely accused  him  taking bribes,<ref>Kenyon  p.136</ref> and  he was dismissed from office  early in 1687, much  to the regret of the Irish public.<ref>O'Flanagan</ref> He demanded an interview with the King, which James  grudgingly granted, and demanded to know the reason for his dismissal.  James would reply only that it was entirely his own fault.<ref>DNB</ref>\n\nHe returned to  his practice at the Bar  in England, but he did not flourish, and was said to have been reduced to  a condition of near poverty. His  fortunes were restored by the [[Glorious Revolution|Revolution of 1688]], of which he was an early and strong supporter. He was appointed [[King's Counsel]]; entered the House of Commons as member for [[Windsor (UK Parliament constituency)|Windsor]] in 1690, and late that year, after William III had overcome his opponents in Ireland,  was reappointed Lord Chancellor of Ireland.\n\n== Second term ==\nHis second term as Chancellor,  like his first,  was  plagued with political controversy; ironically, having been removed from office for  showing a lack of favour to  Roman Catholics, he was now accused of excessive sympathy to their cause. In his capacity as [[Lord Justice of Ireland]] he signed the [[Treaty of Limerick]], which gave  generous terms of surrender to the defeated Catholic supporters of James II, promising  them [[religious tolerance]], security of property and a general [[pardon]].  Porter was determined to secure  observance of the  terms of the Treaty, so far as possible. This brought him into conflict with most other members of the Dublin administration, although he had a strong  ally  in [[Sir Richard Cox, 1st Baronet|Sir Richard Cox]], himself a future Lord Chancellor.  The conflict intensified after the appointment of [[Henry Capel, 1st Baron Capel|Lord Capel]] as Lord Deputy. Porter's opponents were determined to have him removed, the  great difficulty being that King [[William III of England|William III]] thought well of him. In 1693 he was charged with maladministration before the English  House of Commons. Being still a member of the House, he attended the hearing  in person and secured a favourable verdict.<ref>Ball ''Judges in Ireland''</ref>\n\n== Impeachment ==\nHis enemies returned to the attack in 1695 when he was [[impeached]]   by the [[Irish House of Commons]] for [[high crimes and misdemeanours]]; the articles, while including a reference to [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] sympathies,  chiefly concerned his conduct as a judge and listed a series of alleged acts of [[corruption]]   and [[abuse of office]]. Porter was permitted to speak in his own defence.  His speech was generally  agreed to have been a masterpiece:  unfortunately no copy  of it survives. We  know that Porter, who prided himself on his magnanimity,  promised to bear no malice against his accusers.  The  House of Commons rejected the charges by a large majority.<ref>O'Flanagan</ref> Why the impeachment was brought in the first place remains something of a mystery. Suspicion naturally pointed to Capel, the Lord Deputy, who was certainly no friend of Porter's.

[[AllMusic]] editor Andy Kellman said that despite the length of the record, he praised Musiq's growing musicianship to craft modern R&B tracks that don't carry gimmicks or personas that give his performances on them \"a sense of intimacy that many of his contemporaries lack.\" He concluded by calling it \"one of the finest contemporary R&B releases of 2003, with both style and substance in good supply.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/> Raymond Fiore from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said of Musiq being able to transcend his \"humble-pie persona\" amongst the other neo soul artists throughout the album: \"But while the former \u201dSoulchild\u201d is maddeningly predictable, the grooves on ''Soulstar'' prove surprisingly rewarding.

[[AllMusic]] editor Andy Kellman said that despite the length of the record, he praised Musiq's growing musicianship to craft modern R&B tracks that don't carry gimmicks or personas that give his performances on them \"a sense of intimacy that many of his contemporaries lack.\" He concluded by calling it \"one of the finest contemporary R&B releases of 2003, with both style and substance in good supply.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/> Raymond Fiore from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said of Musiq being able to transcend his \"humble-pie persona\" amongst the other neo soul artists throughout the album: \"But while the former \u201dSoulchild\u201d is maddeningly predictable, the grooves on ''Soulstar'' prove surprisingly rewarding.

A gridle-like tissue splits the valves.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThis specific type of chiton displays hundreds of shell eyes (< 100 \u00b5m) embedded in their dorsal shell. These eyes provide special vision, containing a retina, layer of screening pigment and a lens.<ref>Speiser, D., Demartini, D., & Oakley, T. (2014).

The RCMP provides law enforcement at the federal level. It also provides provincial policing in eight of Canada's provinces ([[Alberta]], [[British Columbia]], [[Manitoba]], [[New Brunswick]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Prince Edward Island]], and [[Saskatchewan]], i.e. all except Ontario and Quebec) and local policing on contract basis in the three territories ([[Northwest Territories]], [[Nunavut]], and [[Yukon]]) and more than 150 municipalities, 600 aboriginal communities, and three international airports. The RCMP does not provide active provincial or municipal policing in [[Ontario]] or [[Quebec]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/about-ausujet/index-eng.htm |title=About the RCMP |publisher=Royal Canadian Mounted Police |date=April 26, 2016 |accessdate=May 7, 2016}}</ref> However, all members of the RCMP have jurisdiction as a [[peace officer]] in [[Provinces and territories of Canada|all]] parts of [[Canada]], including [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act|publisher=RCMP|year=1985|isbn=|location=|pages=s. 11.1}}</ref>\n\nDespite the name, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police is no longer an actual [[mounted police]] force, with horses only being used at ceremonial events. The predecessor NWMP and RNWMP had relied on horses for transport for most of their history, though the RNWMP was switching to automobiles at the time of the merger.\n\nAs Canada's national police force, the RCMP is primarily responsible for enforcing federal laws throughout Canada while general law and order including the enforcement of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|criminal code]] and applicable provincial legislation is constitutionally the responsibility of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces and territories]]. Larger cities may form their own municipal police departments.\n\nThe two most populous provinces, [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]], maintain provincial forces: the [[Ontario Provincial Police]] and {{lang|fr|[[S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec]]}}. The other eight provinces contract policing responsibilities to the RCMP. The RCMP provides front-line policing in those provinces under the direction of the provincial governments. When [[Newfoundland]] joined the confederation in 1949, the RCMP entered the province and absorbed the then [[Newfoundland Ranger Force]], which patrolled most of Newfoundland's rural areas. The [[Royal Newfoundland Constabulary#Operations|Royal Newfoundland Constabulary]] patrols urban areas of the province. In the territories, the RCMP is the sole [[territorial police force]]. Many municipalities throughout Canada contract to the RCMP. Thus, the RCMP polices at the federal, provincial, and municipal level. In several areas of Canada, it is the only police force.\n\nThe RCMP is responsible for an unusually large breadth of duties. Under their federal mandate, the RCMP police throughout Canada, including Ontario and Quebec (albeit under smaller scales there). Federal operations include: enforcing federal laws including commercial crime, counterfeiting, drug trafficking, border integrity, organized crime, and other related matters; providing counter-terrorism and domestic security; providing [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police Protective Policing|protection services]] for the [[Monarchy of Canada|Canadian Monarch]], [[Governor General of Canada|governor general]], [[Prime Minister of Canada|prime minister]], their families and residences, and other [[Minister of the Crown|ministers of the Crown]], visiting dignitaries, and diplomatic missions; and participating in various international policing efforts.\n\nUnder provincial and municipal contracts the RCMP provides front-line policing in all areas outside of Ontario and Quebec that do not have an established local police force. There are detachments located in small villages in the [[Northern Canada|far north]], remote [[First Nations]] [[Indian reserve|reserves]], and rural towns, but also larger cities such as [[Surrey, British Columbia]] (population 468,251). There, support units investigate for their own detachments, and smaller municipal police forces. Investigations include major crimes, homicides, forensic identification, collision forensics, police dogs, emergency response teams, explosives disposal, and undercover operations. Under its National Police Services branch the RCMP supports all police forces in Canada via the [[Canadian Police Information Centre]], [[Criminal Intelligence Service Canada]], Forensic Science and Identification Services, [[Canadian Firearms Program]], and the [[Ontario Police College|Canadian Police College]].\n\nThe [[RCMP Security Service]] was a specialized political intelligence and counterintelligence branch with national security responsibilities, replaced by the [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]] in 1984, following revelations of illegal [[covert operation]]s relating to the [[Quebec sovereignty movement|Quebec separatist movement]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080425205414/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0004009 \"Inquiry Into Certain Activities of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Royal Commission of,\"] ''Canadian Encyclopedia.''

Macdonald]] first began planning a permanent force to patrol the [[North-West Territories]] after the Dominion of Canada purchased the territory from the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]. Reports from army officers surveying the territory led to the recommendation that a mounted force of between 100 to 150 mounted riflemen could maintain law and order. The Prime Minister first announced the force as the \"North West Mounted Rifles\". However, officials in the United States raised concerns that an armed force along the border was a prelude to a military buildup. Macdonald then renamed the force the [[North-West Mounted Police]] (NWMP) when formed in 1873.<ref>p.52 Sendzikas, Aldona ''Stanley Barracks: Toronto's Military Legacy'' Dundurn Press Ltd., 01/01/2011</ref>\n\nThe force added \"royal\" to its name in 1904. It merged with the Dominion Police, the main police force for all points east of Manitoba, in 1920 and was renamed the \"Royal Canadian Mounted Police\". The new organization was charged with federal law enforcement in all the provinces and territories, and immediately established its modern role as protector of Canadian national security, as well as assuming responsibility for national [[counterintelligence]].\n\nAs part of its national security and intelligence functions, the RCMP infiltrated ethnic or political groups considered to be dangerous to Canada. This included the [[Communist Party of Canada]], but also a variety of minority cultural and nationalist groups. The force was also deeply involved in immigration matters, and especially deportations of suspected radicals. They were especially concerned with [[Ukrainian Canadian|Ukrainian]] groups, both nationalist and socialist.<ref>Hewitt, Steve. \"Policing the Promised Land: The RCMP and Negative Nation-building in Alberta and Saskatchewan in the Interwar Period\", ''The Prairie West as Promised Land'' ed. R. Douglas Francis and Chris Kitzan (Calgary: University of Calgary Press, 2007), 318-320.</ref> The [[Chinese Canadian|Chinese community]] was also targeted because of disproportionate links to [[opium den]]s. Historians estimate fully two percent of the Chinese community was deported between 1923 and 1932, largely under the provisions of the ''Opium and Narcotics Drugs Act'' (ONDA).<ref>Hewitt, 322</ref> Besides the RCMP's new responsibilities in intelligence, drugs enforcement, and immigration, the force also assisted numerous other federal agencies with tasks such as enforcing the [[Canadian Indian residential school system|residential school]] system for [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal children]].\n[[File:RCMP 1935 postcard.jpg|thumb|upright|Mountie, c.1935]]\nIn 1935, the RCMP, collaborating with the [[Regina Police Service]], crushed the [[On-to-Ottawa Trek]] by sparking the Regina Riot, in which one city police officer and one protester were killed. The Trek, which had been organized to call attention to the abysmal conditions in relief camps, therefore failed to reach Ottawa, but nevertheless had profound political reverberations. The RCMP also lost four officers in Saskatchewan and Alberta that year in what became the [[1935 Royal Canadian Mounted Police Killings]].\n\nThe RCMP employed [[special constable]]s to assist with [[Strike action|strikebreaking]] in the interwar period. For a brief period in the late 1930s, a volunteer militia group, the [[Legion of Frontiersmen]], were affiliated with the RCMP. Many members of the RCMP belonged to this organization, which was prepared to serve as an auxiliary force. In later years, special constables performed duties such as policing airports and, in some Canadian provinces, the courthouses.\n\nIn 1932 saw the men, vehicles and vessels of the Customs Preventive Service, National Revenue, absorbed by the RCMP. This created the Marine Section and the Excise Section.<ref>McIntosh, Dave. ''The Collectors: A History of Canadian Customs and Excise'' (Published by NC Press in association with Revenue Canada, Customs and Excise, 1984)</ref> The acquisition of the RCMP [[schooner]] ''[[St. Roch (ship)|St. Roch]]'' facilitated the first effective patrol of Canada's [[Arctic]] territory. It was the first vessel to navigate the [[Northwest Passage]] from west to east (1940\u201342), the first to navigate the passage in one season (from Halifax to Vancouver in 1944), the first to sail either way through the passage in one season, and the first to circumnavigate North America (1950).<ref>Kelly, Nora and William.

This led to the [[Royal Commission of Inquiry into Certain Activities of the RCMP]], better known as the \"McDonald Commission\", named for the presiding judge, Justice David Cargill McDonald. The commission recommended that the force's intelligences duties be removed in favour of the creation of a separate intelligence agency, the [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]] (CSIS).\n\n===Modern era===\n[[File:Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Sunset Ceremony 2012.jpg|thumb|Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Sunset Ceremony 2012]]\nIn 1993, the [[Special Emergency Response Team]] (SERT), were transferred to the [[Canadian Forces]] (CF), creating a new unit called [[Joint Task Force 2]] (JTF2).

Today, RCMP personnel under the rank of inspector wear blue \"[[gorget]]\" patches on the collar, while officers from inspector to commissioner wear solid blue collars and blue pointed-sleeve cuffs.\n\nMembers once wore a white [[haversack]] on top of this jacket and white [[Gauntlet (glove)|gauntlets]],<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> which contrasted with the red tunic. The modern dress uniform replaces these easily dirtied items with brown leather riding gloves and carrying pouches on the belt.\n\n===Hat===\nAlthough the NWMP contingent at [[Queen Victoria]]'s [[Diamond Jubilee]] wore the campaign hat, it only became official in 1904.\n\nA campaign hat is a broad-brimmed [[felt]] or straw hat, with a high crown, pinched symmetrically at the four corners (Montana crown).\n\nThe hat is most commonly worn as part of a uniform by such agencies as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the [[New Zealand Army]], [[National Park Service|United States Park Rangers]], and Scouts. The RCMP did not adopt it until about 1904. The original primary summer headdress was the white British foreign service helmet, also known as a [[pith helmet]]. This was an impractical choice for the [[Western Canada|Canadian west]], and RCMP members wore a Stetson type hat on patrol and around camp. [[Sam Steele]] is often credited with introducing the Stetson-type hat, and when he left the force to command [[Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians)|Lord Strathcona's Horse]] in South Africa, his unit adopted the Stetson. During winter, members wore a [[Canadian military fur wedge cap]] or [[Busby (military headdress)|busby]]. In British Columbia, the hat features a black bearskin rim belt.\n\n===Breeches===\nThe NWMP wore [[buff (colour)|buff]] or steel grey breeches until they adopted dark blue breeches with yellow-gold strapping (stripes) in 1876.<ref>{{cite book|first=David|last=Ross|page=26|title=The Royal Canadian Mounted Police 1873-1987|isbn=0-85045-834-X|date=March 24, 1988}}</ref> Members often exchanged kit with U.S. cavalry units, and while some believe this was the source for the breeches, the NWMP considered adopting blue breeches with a white strap. Dark blue with yellow-gold strapping is a British cavalry tradition, and most cavalry (later armoured) regiments' dress uniforms feature yellow stripes.\n\n===Boots===\nBlack riding boots changed to the modern brown style called \"Strathcona boots\" or informally as \"high browns\" and the original crossbelts changed to the brown Sam Browne type. The brown colour of the boots and belt the RCMP wear with the Red Serge are from members who applied coats of polish, often during training at Depot Division.\n\n===Spurs===\nThe RCMP's original spurs, known as \"long shank spurs,\" were solid nickel. Their owners occasionally had their regimental number engraved on the inside, and some replaced the [[rowel]] with a US [[buffalo nickel]] {{citation needed|date=May 2016}} to complement the Mounted Police capbadge and avoid using a Canadian coin that would deface the monarch. The RCMP last issued long shank spurs in 1968.\n\nSidearms are standard now, but were often not worn in the early years.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n=== Operational uniform ===\n[[File:RCMP in regular uniform.jpg|thumb|right|upright|RCMP in everyday uniform]]\n[[File:RCMP shoulder flash.png|thumb|Closeup of shoulder flash on sleeve of operational uniform]]\nThe operational uniform is a grey shirt, dark blue trousers with gold stripping, regular patrol boots called \"[[ankle boots]]\", regular duty equipment, and a [[peaked cap|regular policeman's style cap]]. Members on operational duty wear a blue [[Gore-Tex]] open-collar jacket ([[patrol jacket]]), while [[Sergeant-major|sergeants major]] and certain [[non-commissioned officer]]s (NCOs) involved in recruit training or media relations wear a dark blue jacket (blue serge). Depending on their duties, officers wear white shirts and the patrol jacket or blue serge. During the summer, officers wear a short-sleeved shirt. Winter dress is a long-sleeved shirt. A tie is worn on occasion for events such as testifying in court. In colder weather, members may wear heavier boots, winter coats ([[storm coat]]s) and a fur cap or toque.\n\nIn 1990, Baltej Singh Dhillon became the RCMP's first [[Sikh]] officer to be allowed to wear a [[turban]] instead of the traditional [[Campaign hat#Royal Canadian Mounted Police|Stetson]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/1990-sikh-mounties-permitted-to-wear-turbans|title=1990: Sikh Mounties permitted to wear turbans|publisher=CBC Archives|accessdate=3 February 2017}}</ref> On March 15, the federal government, despite protests, decided they would allow Sikhs to wear [[Dastar|their religious headgear]] while on duty as RCMP officers, as had been the practice for Sikh members of [[Canadian Forces]] for decades.\n\nDespite ongoing pressure from groups such as the [[Association for the Protection of Fur-Bearing Animals]],<ref>[http://www.furbearerdefenders.com/index.php/campaigns/rcmp-hats RCMP Hats] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101045029/http://www.furbearerdefenders.com/index.php/campaigns/rcmp-hats |date=November 1, 2013 }}.

A clasp is awarded for each successive 5 years to 40 years. Members also receive a service badge star for each five years' service, which is worn on the left sleeve.  There are specialist insignia for positions such as first aid instructor and dog handler, and pilot's wings are worn by aviators.

The force raised the Canadian Mounted Rifles, mostly from NWMP members, for service in South Africa. For the CMR's distinguished service there, King Edward VII honoured the NWMP by changing the name to the \"Royal Northwest Mounted Police\" (RNWMP) on June 24, 1904.\n\nDuring the First World War, the Royal Northwest Mounted Police (RNWMP) conducted [[Border#Jurisdictional borders|border]] patrols, [[surveillance]] of enemy [[Alien (law)|alien]]s, and enforcement of [[national security]] regulations within Canada. However, RNWMP officers also served overseas. On August 6, 1914, a [[Squadron (army)|squadron]] of volunteers from the RNWMP was formed to serve with the Canadian Light Horse in France. In 1918, two more squadrons were raised, A Squadron for service in France and [[Flanders]] and B Squadron for service in the [[Canadian Siberian Expeditionary Force]].\n\nIn September 1939, at the outset of the Second World War, the Canadian Army had no military police. Five days after war was declared the Royal Canadian Mounted Police received permission to form a provost company of force volunteers. It was designated \"No. 1 Provost Company (RCMP)\", and became the [[Canadian Provost Corps]]. Six months after war was declared its members were overseas in Europe and served throughout the [[World War II|Second World War]] as [[Canadian Forces Military Police|military police]].\n\n===Honours===\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police were accorded the status of a regiment of dragoons in 1921.

They are the police officers of the RCMP and are responsible for investigating crime and have the authority to make arrests. RMs operate in over 750 detachments, including 200 municipalities and more than 600 Aboriginal communities. RMs are normally assigned to general policing duties at an RCMP detachment for a minimum of three years. These duties allow them to experience a broad range of assignments and experiences, such as responding to [[Emergency telephone number|emergency (9-1-1) calls]], foot patrol, bicycle patrol, traffic enforcement, collecting evidence at crime scenes, testifying in court, apprehending criminals and plain clothes duties. Regular members also serve in over 150 different types of operational and administrative opportunities available within the RCMP, these include: major crime investigations, emergency response, forensic identification, [[Vehicular accident reconstruction|forensic collision reconstruction]], international peacekeeping, bike or marine patrol, explosives disposal and police dog services. Also included are administrative roles including human resources, corporate planning, policy analysis and public affairs.\n\n===Auxiliary constables and other staff===\nBesides the regular RCMP officers, several types of designations exist which give them assorted powers and responsibilities over policing issues.\n\nCurrently, there are:\n* Community constables: Varies across Canada {{Citation needed|reason=Awaiting formal report for the RCMP.

However, they are given peace officer powers when on duty with a regular member (RM). Their duties consist mainly of assisting RMs in routine events, for example cordoning off crime scene areas, crowd control, participating in [[Neighborhood watch|community policing]], assistance during situations where regular members might be overwhelmed with their duties (e.g., keeping watch of a backseat detainee while RM interviews a victim). They are identified by the wording of \"RCMP Auxiliary\" on cars, jackets and shoulder flashes\n\n;[[Special Constable#Canada|Special constable]]s (S/Cst.): Employees of the RCMP have varied duties depending on where they are deployed, but are often given this designation because of an expertise they possess which needs to be applied in a certain area. For example, an Aboriginal person might be appointed a special constable in order to assist regular members as they police an Aboriginal community where English is not well understood, and where the special constable speaks the language well. They still perform this role today in many isolated northern communities and the RCMP has 122 special constables who are active in the RCMP today, and they are drawn almost entirely from the same Aboriginal communities that they serve.\n\n:From the early years of policing in northern Canada, and well into the 1950s, local aboriginal people were hired by the RCMP as special constables and were employed as guides and to obtain and care for sled dog teams. Many of these former special constables still reside in the north to this day and are still involved in regimental functions of the RCMP.\n\n;Civilian members of the RCMP: While not delegated the powers of police officers, they are instead hired for their specialized scientific, technological, communications and administrative skills. Since the RCMP is a multi-faceted law enforcement organization with responsibilities for federal, provincial and municipal policing duties, it offers employment opportunities for civilian members as professional partners within Canada's national police force.\n\nCivilian members represent approximately 14% of the total RCMP employee population, and are employed within RCMP establishments in most geographical areas of Canada. The following is a list of the most common categories of employment that may be available to interested and qualified individuals.\n\n*Operations\n** Telecommunications operator ([[dispatcher]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/recruiting-recrutement/cm-mc/teleops-opstele-eng.htm |title=Telecommunications Operators |publisher=rcmp-grc.gc.ca |date=July 30, 2010 |accessdate=September 1, 2010}}</ref>\n* Scientific\n** [[Toxicology]]\n** [[Chemistry]]\n** [[Biology]] \u2013 [[DNA]]\n** [[Law]]\n*Technical\n** Forensic identification services\n** Instrument technology\n** [[questioned document examination|Document examination]]\n** Counterfeit analysis\n** Firearms technology\n** Electronics technology\n** [[Information technology]]\n** [[Communication]]s\n** Computer systems development\n** [[Telecommunication]]s\n** Information services/public affairs\n* [[Administration of business|Administrative]]\n** Policy development and analysis\n** Staff development and training\n** [[Human resource management]]\n** [[Translation]]\n** Police Records Information Management Environment (PRIME-BC)\n\n;Public service employees: Also referred to as public servants, PSes or PSEs, they provide much of the administrative support for the RCMP in the form of detachment clerks and other administrative support at the headquarters level. They are not police officers, do not wear a uniform, have no police authority and are not bound by the ''RCMP Act''.\n\n;Municipal employees:\nAbbreviated as \"ME\" they are found in RCMP detachments where a contract exists with a municipality to provide front-line policing. MEs are not actually employees of the RCMP, but are instead employed by the local municipality to work in the RCMP detachment. They conduct the same duties that a PSE would and are required to meet the same reliability and security clearance to do so. Many detachment buildings house a combination of municipally and provincially funded detachments, and therefore there are often PSEs and MEs found working together in them.\n\n===Ranks===\nThe rank system of the RCMP is partly a result of their origin as a [[paramilitary]] force. Upon its founding, the RCMP adopted the rank insignia of the [[Canadian Army]] (which in turn came from the [[British Army]]), which is almost identical to that of the current Canadian Army. Like in a military, the RCMP also has a distinction between commissioned and non-commissioned officers. The non-commissioned ranks are mostly based on military ranks (apart from constable). Non-commissioned officer ranks above staff sergeant resemble those that formerly existed in the Canadian Army, but have since been replaced by [[warrant officer]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uniforminsignia.org/?option=com_insigniasearch&Itemid=53&result=552|title=Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP\u00a8) / Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) / Gendarmerie royale du Canada (GRC)|publisher=}}</ref> The commissioned officer ranks, by contrast, use a set of non-military titles that are often used in Commonwealth police services. The number of higher ranks like chief superintendent and deputy commissioner have been added on and increased since the formation of the force, while the lower commissioned rank of sub-inspector has been dropped.\n\nThe numbers are current as of April 1, 2019:<ref>{{cite web|last1=Government of Canada |first1=Royal Canadian Mounted Police|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/about-ausujet/organi-eng.htm|title=Organizational Structure |website=www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca |accessdate=17 May 2019 |date=1 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"6\" |Commissioned officers\n|-\n!Commissioner\n!Deputy commissioner\n!Assistant commissioner\n!Chief superintendent\n!Superintendent\n!Inspector\n|-\n!{{lang|fr|Commissaire}}\n!{{lang|fr|Sous-commissaire}}\n!{{lang|fr|Commissaire adjoint}}\n!{{lang|fr|Surintendant principal}}\n!{{lang|fr|Surintendant}}\n!{{lang|fr|Inspecteur}}\n|-\n!Commr.\n!D/Commr.\n!A/Commr.\n!C/Supt.\n!Supt.\n!Insp.\n|-\n!1\n!6\n!33\n!55\n!186\n!331\n|-\n|[[File:RCMP Commissioner.png|center|frameless|150x150px]]\n|[[File:RCMP Deputy Commissioner.png|center|frameless|150x150px]]\n|[[File:RCMP Assistant Commissioner.png|center|frameless|150x150px]]\n|[[File:RCMP Chief Superintendent.png|center|frameless|150x150px]]\n|[[File:RCMP Superintendent.png|center|frameless|150x150px]]\n|[[File:RCMP Inspector.png|center|frameless|150x150px]]\n|}\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/en/regular-member-annual-rates-pay|title=Regular Member - Annual Rates of Pay {{!}} Royal Canadian Mounted Police|last=Government of Canada|first=Royal Canadian Mounted Police|date=2012-09-14|website=www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca|access-date=2019-07-17}}</ref> these are the official abbreviations for the Commissioned Officers and also the Non-Commissioned officers in the RCMP.

Depending on the dress, badges are worn on the shoulder as slip-ons, on shoulder boards, or directly on the [[epaulette]]s. The lower ranks are non-commissioned officers and the insignia continues to be based on pre-1968 Canadian Army patterns. Since 1990, the non-commissioned officers' rank insignia has been embroidered on the epaulette slip-ons. Non-commissioned rank badges are worn on the right sleeve of the scarlet/blue tunic and blue jacket. The constables wear no rank insignia. There are also 122 special constables, as well as a varying number of reserve constables, auxiliary constables, and students who wear identifying insignia.\n\nThe [[Bath star|star]], or \"pip\", used in the insignia of commissioned officers represents the military Knight Grand Cross of the [[Order of the Bath]]. The Order's motto ({{lang|la|tria juncta in uno}}, \"three joined in one\", referring to the [[holy trinity]]) is inscribed in a band in the middle of it. The three crowns inset in the centre not only represent the Christian Trinity, but also the three former kingdoms that became the United Kingdom. The RCMP formerly had subaltern ([[junior officer]]) ranks that were indicated by one \"pip\" for a sub-inspector (equivalent to an army second lieutenant) to three \"pips\" for an inspector (equivalent to an army captain).<ref>p.38 Ross, David & May Robin ''The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (1873-1987)'' 1988 Osprey Publishing.</ref> A reorganization in 1960 changed the insignia to three \"pips\" for sub-inspectors<ref>pp.38-39 Ross, David & May, Robin ''The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (1873-1987)'' 1988 Osprey Publishing.</ref> and a crown for inspectors,<ref>pp.38-39 Ross, David & May, Robin ''The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (1873-1987)'' 1988 Osprey Publishing</ref> making the latter a [[field officer]] rank. The rank of sub-inspector was abolished in 1990, leaving the RCMP with no subaltern ranks.\n\nA royal crown is used in the regimental cap badge and the insignia of senior commissioned officers. In 1955 [[St. Edward's Crown]] replaced the [[Tudor Crown]]. Although Queen Elizabeth II had adopted the redesign of the heraldic crown in 1953, it took some time to design, approve, and manufacture the new insignia.\n\nThe crossed [[Mameluke]] [[Kilij|sabre]] and [[Baton (military)|baton]] is the insignia for [[general officer]]s. In the RCMP it designates the commissioner (equivalent to an Army general) and their subordinate deputy commissioners (equivalent to Army lieutenant-generals). The assistant commissioners use the crown-over-three-pips insignia of an Army [[Brigadier#British tradition|brigadier]].\n\nThe brass shoulder title pin on the epaulettes was changed from \"RCMP\" to \"GRC-RCMP\" in 1968. ({{lang|fr|GRC}} stands for {{lang|fr|Gendarmerie royale du Canada}}, the RCMP's French-language title). This was due to a 1968 ruling stating that all statutes had to be published bilingually in both English and French. As a law enforcement agency, the RCMP had to use ranks and titles in both languages. This was later reinforced by the [[Official Languages Act (Canada)|Official Languages Act of 1969]].\n\n==Equipment and vehicles==\n[[File:G20 Toronto - RCMP Truck.jpg|thumb|RCMP truck at the G20 summit in Toronto]]\n\n===Land fleet===\nThe RCMP Land Transport Fleet inventory includes:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/land-terre/index-eng.htm |title=Land Transport |publisher=Rcmp-grc.gc.ca |date=November 14, 2006 |accessdate=May 22, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620013431/http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/land-terre/index-eng.htm |archivedate=June 20, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n* [[Police car|Cars]]: 5,330\n* Unmarked vehicles: 2,811\n* Light [[Police truck|trucks]]: 2,090\n* Heavy trucks: 123 \n* SUVs: 616 \n* [[Police motorcycle|Motorcycles]]: 34\n* Small snowmobiles: 481\n* All-terrain vehicles: 181\n* Gas railway cars: 1\n* Tractors: 27\n* [[Police bus|Buses]]: 3\n* Total: 11,697\n\n===Marine craft===\n[[File:Toronto police boats on lake.JPG|thumb|RCMP-CCG vessel ''Simmonds'' with CCGS ''Cape Hurd'']]\nThe RCMP polices [[Canadian Internal Waters]], including the [[Territorial waters|territorial sea]] and contiguous zone as well as the [[Great Lakes]] and [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]]; such operations are provided by the RCMP's Federal Services Directorate and includes enforcing Canada's environment, fisheries, customs and immigration laws.

The Ross Mk I was issued from 1905 to 1907 and the improved Ross Mk II was in testing from 1909 to 1912.<ref name=\"calibremag.ca\"/> The Mk I design was accepted by the Canadian Militia in 1903. The NWMP looked at acquiring the Ross to replace the Winchester and Lee-Metford and ordered 1000. Production problems led to delays until 1904; the most glaring being that the finished product did not match their original specifications.<ref name=\"calibremag.ca\"/> The NWMP demanded their contract carbines use a different set of iron sight (which later became standard on the Mk II) which delayed production for a further year.<ref name=\"calibremag.ca\"/> The carbines received in 1905 were plagued with quality control problems that made them more fragile than the weapons they were to replace. After a constable suffered an eye injury in 1907 the Ross carbines were withdrawn.<ref name=\"calibremag.ca\"/> When the improved Ross Mk II rifles arrived in 1909 the wary NWMP decided to test fire all of them fully before issuing them.

Replaced by the Lee-Enfield Carbine.\n* [[Winchester Model 1876]] saddle [[carbine]]\u2014issued in [[.45-75 Winchester]].

Mounties fiction became a popular genre in both [[pulp magazine]]s and book form. Among the best-selling authors who specialized in tales of the Mounted Police were [[James Oliver Curwood]], [[Laurie York Erskine]], James B Hendryx, T Lund, Harwood Steele (the son of Sam Steele), and William Byron Mowery.\n\nIn other media, a famous example is the [[Radio drama|radio]] and [[Television program|television series]], ''[[Challenge of the Yukon|Sergeant Preston of the Yukon]].'' [[Dudley Do-Right]] (of ''[[The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show]]'') is a 1960s example of the comic aspect of the Mountie myth, as is [[Klondike Kat]], from [[Total Television]]. The [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical and Hollywood movie ''[[Rose Marie (1936 film)|Rose-Marie]]'' is a 1930s example of its romantic side. A successful combination were a series of ''[[Renfrew of the Royal Mounted]]'' boy's adventure novels written by Laurie York Erskine beginning in 1922 running to 1941. In the 1930s Erskine narrated a ''Sgt Renfrew of the Mounties'' radio show and a series of films with actor-singer James Newill playing Renfrew were released between 1937 and 1940. In 1953 portions of the films were mixed with new sequences of Newill for a ''Renfrew of the Mounted'' television series.\n\nBruce Carruthers  (b.1901\u2013d.1953), a former Mounted Police corporal (1919\u20131923), served as an unofficial [[technical advisor]] to Hollywood in many films with RCMP characters.<ref>Barr, William ''Red Serge and Polar Bear Pants\" The Biography of Harry Stallworthy, RCMP'' University of Alberta Press 2004</ref> They included ''Heart of the North'' (1938), ''Susannah of the Mounties'' (1939), ''Northern Pursuit'' (1943), ''Gene Autry and The Mounties'' (1951), ''The Wild North'' (1952), and ''The Pony Soldier'' (1952).\n\n===Modern culture===\nIn 1959, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] aired [[R.C.M.P. (TV series)|''R.C.M.P.'']], a half-hour dramatic series about an RCMP detachment keeping the peace and fighting crime. Filmed in black and white, in and around Ottawa by [[F. R. Crawley|Crawley Films]], the series was co-produced with the [[BBC]] and the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] and ran for 39 episodes. It was noted for its pairing of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois and Anglo officers.\n\nCanadians also poke fun at the RCMP with [[Dave Broadfoot|Sergeant Renfrew]] and his faithful dog Cuddles in various sketches produced by the ''[[Royal Canadian Air Farce]]'' comedy troupe. On ''[[That '70s Show]]'' Mounties were played by [[Second City Television|SCTV]] alumni [[Joe Flaherty]] and [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]]. The British have also exploited the myth: the BBC television series ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' featured a group of Mounties singing the chorus in ''[[The Lumberjack Song]]'' in the [[lumberjack]] sketch.\n\nThe 1972\u201390 CBC series ''[[The Beachcombers]]'' features a character named Constable John Constable who attempts to enforce the law in the town of [[Gibsons, British Columbia]].\n\nIn comic books, the [[Marvel Comics]] characters of [[Alpha Flight]] are described on several occasions as \"RCMP auxiliaries,\" and two of their members, [[Snowbird (comics)|Snowbird]] and the second [[Major Mapleleaf]] are depicted as serving members of the force. In the latter case, due to trademark issues, Major Mapleleaf is described as a \"Royal Canadian Mountie\" in the opening roll call pages of each issue of ''Alpha Flight'' he appears in.\n\n[[Charles Bronson]] and [[Lee Marvin]] starred in the 1981 movie ''[[Death Hunt]]'' that fictionalized the RCMP pursuit of [[Albert Johnson (criminal)|Albert Johnson]].\n\nIn the early 1990s, Canadian [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] [[Jacques Rougeau]] utilized the [[List of professional wrestling terms#G|gimmick]] of \"The Mountie\" while wrestling for the [[WWE|WWF]]. He typically wore the Red Serge to the ring, and carried a [[Cattle prod|shock stick]] as an illegal weapon. As his character was portrayed as an [[Heel (professional wrestling)|evil]] Mountie, the RCMP ultimately won an injunction preventing Rougeau from wrestling as this character in Canada, though he was not prevented from doing so outside the country. He briefly held the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]] in 1992.\n\nThe 1998 [[swan song]] of [[Nick Berry]]'s time on UK drama ''[[Heartbeat (UK TV series)|Heartbeat]]'' features his character, Sergeant Nick Rowan, transferring to Canada and taking the rank of constable in the Mounties. The special telemovie was titled ''Heartbeat: Changing Places.''\n\nThe 1994\u201398 TV series ''[[Due South]]'' pairs Mountie Constable Benton Fraser with streetwise American detective Ray Vecchio cleaning up the streets of Chicago. It mainly derives its entertainment from the [[stereotype|perceived differences]] in attitude and culture between these two countries' police forces. Fraser is depicted as honest and polite to a fault, even refusing to carry a loaded sidearm when \"assisting\" Detective Vecchio, but almost superhuman in his abilities for thwarting crime.\n\nA pair of Mounties staff the RCMP detachment in the fictional town of [[Lynx River]], Northwest Territories, in the CBC series ''[[North of 60]].'' The series, which aired from 1992 to 1998, is about events in the mostly indigenous community, but the Mounties feature prominently in each episode.\n\nAnother TV series from the 1990s, ''[[Bordertown (1989 TV series)|Bordertown]]'' features an NWMP corporal paired with a [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. marshal]] securing law and order on a frontier U.S.\u2013Canada border town. In the ABC TV mini-series ''[[Answered by Fire]],'' at least three mounties are featured. Mounties also appear in the TV series ''[[When Calls the Heart]]'' (Hallmark Channel).\n\nThe 1987 [[Brian De Palma]] film ''[[The Untouchables (film)|The Untouchables]]'' features cooperation between the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]] task force, led by [[Eliot Ness]], and the Mounties against liquor smuggling across the [[Canada\u2013United States border]].\n\nThe 1995 album ''[[C'est Cheese]]'' by Canadian musical comedy group [[The Arrogant Worms]] includes \"The Mountie Song\", which tells the story of a dissatisfied Mountie.\n\nIn his 1999, album ''[[Soiree]]'' Newfoundland musician A. Frank Willis included \"Savage Cop in Savage Cove\" which was based on a true story and went on to become a big hit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tidespoint.com/music/afrankwillis.shtml|title=Newfoundland music books food videos images arts crafts|access-date=October 25, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918111453/http://www.tidespoint.com/music/afrankwillis.shtml|archive-date=September 18, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nFrom 2011, the [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] fantasy drama series ''[[The Listener (TV series)|The Listener]]'' regularly features characters who work for the Integrated Investigative Bureau, a fictional division of the RCMP that brings together various specialists, officers and civilian consultants to work on high-profile or federal cases. Although characters in the employ of the IIB are rarely, if ever, depicted wearing uniform, they are often addressed by their ranks \u2013 two main characters are Sergeant Michelle McClusky and Corporal Dev Clark.\n\n===Mountie merchandise and trademark===\nThere are products and merchandise that are made in the image of the RCMP, like Mounties statues or hats. Before 1995, the RCMP had little control over these products.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police received an international licence on April 1, 1995, requiring those who use the RCMP to pay a licensing fee. Proceeds from the fees are used for community awareness programmes.<ref>{{cite news|last=Farnsworth |first=Clyde H. |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CEEDE133CF937A35751C0A963958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |title=For the Mounties, Justice Is Now a Licensing Fee\u2014New York Times |newspaper=New York Times |date=February 4, 1995 |accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref> Those that do not pay the licensing fee are legally unable to use the name of the RCMP or their correct uniforms, though a film such as ''[[Canadian Bacon]]'' used the name \"Royal Mounted Canadian Police\" and the character in the ''[[Dudley Do-Right (film)|Dudley Do-Right]]'' film did not wear accurate insignia.\n\nThrough a Master Licensing Agreement (MLA) with the RCMP, the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police Foundation|RCMP Foundation]] is responsible for managing the commercial use of the RCMP name, image, and protected marks.<ref>Royal Canadian Mounted Police, \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20071023111746/http://www.bookrags.com/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police]\", Retrieved July 28, 2011</ref> The foundation issues selected companies a royalty-based agreement allowing them to produce and market high-quality official RCMP merchandise.

In 2007, through a decree signed by Commissioner Beverley Busson, the operating name was changed to the \"Royal Canadian Mounted Police Foundation\".\n\nThe [[RCMP Heritage Centre]] is a multi-million dollar museum designed by [[Arthur Erickson]] that opened May 2007 in Regina, Saskatchewan, at the RCMP Academy, Depot Division. It replaced the old RCMP museum and is designed to celebrate the role of the force in Canada's history.\n\n===RCMP Bands===\n[[File:Cornemuse 2.jpg|thumb|Although the official band of the RCMP has disbanded, several small RCMP pipe bands such as this one still remain.]]\n[[File:Canada. Mounties Band, Yukon, 1901.jpg|thumb|A Mounties Band in [[Yukon]], 1901.]]\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police Band ({{Lang-fr|La Musique de la Gendarmerie royale du Canada}}) was considered one of the best professional bands assembled in Canada. Although it was an official regimental band, the members worked in the band as a secondary job. It is generally considered to have begun in 1938, though there were various police bands in the RCMP that flourished at the time, leading the [[Canadian government]] granting approval for the creation of a full-time central band in December 1958, with its headquarters in the capital of [[Ottawa]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Luscombe |first1=Stephen |title=Royal Canadian Mounted Police |url=https://www.britishempire.co.uk/forces/armyunits/canadiancavalry/rcmpbands.htm |website=www.britishempire.co.uk}}</ref><ref name=\"Altissimo\">{{cite web |title=The Royal Canadian Mounted Police Band |url=https://militarymusic.com/blogs/military-music/13516489-the-royal-canadian-mounted-police-band |website=Altissimo! |language=en}}</ref> Appearances made by the band included [[Expo 86]] and the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings|Commonwealth Conference]] in [[Vancouver]], the [[Calgary Winter Olympics]] in 1988, as well as the visits of [[Soviet President]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and Queen [[Elizabeth II]] in 1990.<ref name=Altissimo/><ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=https://rcmpband.ca/history/ |website=RCMP Band |language=en |date=26 April 2014}}</ref> It was dissolved in 1994 due to government budget cuts.\n\nIn its 55 year existence, it operated as a voluntary regimental band, with its members working with it as a secondary job apart from their other duties in the RCMP. Members of the band wore the RCMP's notable [[Red Serge]] as part of their [[full dress uniform]] and adopted drill seen in [[Canadian military bands]] and bands in the [[British Army]]. Its longest serving director was Superintendent Edwin Joseph Lydall who served from 1948 to 1968.<ref>http://canadianobits.com/ontario/webbbs_config.pl/noframes/read/427</ref> \n\nToday, instead of brass and reed bands, the RCMP sports eight regional pipe bands across the major cities of the 10 provinces.

The creation of the tartan was the result of a committee created in the early 1990s to create a tartan by its 125th anniversary. Upon approval from commissioner Phillip Murray, the tartan was registered with the [[Scottish Tartans Society]] and presented to the agency by [[Anne, Princess Royal|Anne the Princess Royal]] during her [[Royal tours of Canada by the Canadian Royal Family|royal visit to Canada]] in 1998. The tartan appeared for the first time by a RCMP pipe band at the [[Royal Nova Scotia International Tattoo]] in July and August of 1998.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/en/tartan |title=Tartan |publisher=Royal Canadian Mounted Police |accessdate=December 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Controversies and criticism==\n{{Further|List of controversies involving the Royal Canadian Mounted Police}}\nAmerican historian Andrew Graybill has argued that the Mounted Police historically resembled the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] in many ways.  He argues that each protected the established order by confining and removing Indians, by tightly controlling the mixed blood peoples (the African Americans in Texas and the M\u00e9tis in Canada), assisted the large-scale ranchers against the small-scale ranchers and farmers who fenced the land, and broke the power of labour unions that tried to organize the workers of industrial corporations.<ref>Andrew R.

The RCMP provides law enforcement at the federal level. It also provides provincial policing in eight of Canada's provinces ([[Alberta]], [[British Columbia]], [[Manitoba]], [[New Brunswick]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Prince Edward Island]], and [[Saskatchewan]], i.e. all except Ontario and Quebec) and local policing on contract basis in the three territories ([[Northwest Territories]], [[Nunavut]], and [[Yukon]]) and more than 150 municipalities, 600 aboriginal communities, and three international airports. The RCMP does not provide active provincial or municipal policing in [[Ontario]] or [[Quebec]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/about-ausujet/index-eng.htm |title=About the RCMP |publisher=Royal Canadian Mounted Police |date=April 26, 2016 |accessdate=May 7, 2016}}</ref> However, all members of the RCMP have jurisdiction as a [[peace officer]] in [[Provinces and territories of Canada|all]] parts of [[Canada]], including [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act|publisher=RCMP|year=1985|isbn=|location=|pages=s. 11.1}}</ref>\n\nDespite the name, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police is no longer an actual [[mounted police]] force, with horses only being used at ceremonial events. The predecessor NWMP and RNWMP had relied on horses for transport for most of their history, though the RNWMP was switching to automobiles at the time of the merger.\n\nAs Canada's national police force, the RCMP is primarily responsible for enforcing federal laws throughout Canada while general law and order including the enforcement of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|criminal code]] and applicable provincial legislation is constitutionally the responsibility of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces and territories]]. Larger cities may form their own municipal police departments.\n\nThe two most populous provinces, [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]], maintain provincial forces: the [[Ontario Provincial Police]] and {{lang|fr|[[S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec]]}}. The other eight provinces contract policing responsibilities to the RCMP. The RCMP provides front-line policing in those provinces under the direction of the provincial governments. When [[Newfoundland]] joined the confederation in 1949, the RCMP entered the province and absorbed the then [[Newfoundland Ranger Force]], which patrolled most of Newfoundland's rural areas. The [[Royal Newfoundland Constabulary#Operations|Royal Newfoundland Constabulary]] patrols urban areas of the province. In the territories, the RCMP is the sole [[territorial police force]]. Many municipalities throughout Canada contract to the RCMP. Thus, the RCMP polices at the federal, provincial, and municipal level. In several areas of Canada, it is the only police force.\n\nThe RCMP is responsible for an unusually large breadth of duties. Under their federal mandate, the RCMP police throughout Canada, including Ontario and Quebec (albeit under smaller scales there). Federal operations include: enforcing federal laws including commercial crime, counterfeiting, drug trafficking, border integrity, organized crime, and other related matters; providing counter-terrorism and domestic security; providing [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police Protective Policing|protection services]] for the [[Monarchy of Canada|Canadian Monarch]], [[Governor General of Canada|governor general]], [[Prime Minister of Canada|prime minister]], their families and residences, and other [[Minister of the Crown|ministers of the Crown]], visiting dignitaries, and diplomatic missions; and participating in various international policing efforts.\n\nUnder provincial and municipal contracts the RCMP provides front-line policing in all areas outside of Ontario and Quebec that do not have an established local police force. There are detachments located in small villages in the [[Northern Canada|far north]], remote [[First Nations]] [[Indian reserve|reserves]], and rural towns, but also larger cities such as [[Surrey, British Columbia]] (population 468,251). There, support units investigate for their own detachments, and smaller municipal police forces. Investigations include major crimes, homicides, forensic identification, collision forensics, police dogs, emergency response teams, explosives disposal, and undercover operations. Under its National Police Services branch the RCMP supports all police forces in Canada via the [[Canadian Police Information Centre]], [[Criminal Intelligence Service Canada]], Forensic Science and Identification Services, [[Canadian Firearms Program]], and the [[Ontario Police College|Canadian Police College]].\n\nThe [[RCMP Security Service]] was a specialized political intelligence and counterintelligence branch with national security responsibilities, replaced by the [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]] in 1984, following revelations of illegal [[covert operation]]s relating to the [[Quebec sovereignty movement|Quebec separatist movement]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080425205414/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0004009 \"Inquiry Into Certain Activities of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Royal Commission of,\"] ''Canadian Encyclopedia.''

Macdonald]] first began planning a permanent force to patrol the [[North-West Territories]] after the Dominion of Canada purchased the territory from the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]. Reports from army officers surveying the territory led to the recommendation that a mounted force of between 100 to 150 mounted riflemen could maintain law and order. The Prime Minister first announced the force as the \"North West Mounted Rifles\". However, officials in the United States raised concerns that an armed force along the border was a prelude to a military buildup. Macdonald then renamed the force the [[North-West Mounted Police]] (NWMP) when formed in 1873.<ref>p.52 Sendzikas, Aldona ''Stanley Barracks: Toronto's Military Legacy'' Dundurn Press Ltd., 01/01/2011</ref>\n\nThe force added \"royal\" to its name in 1904. It merged with the Dominion Police, the main police force for all points east of Manitoba, in 1920 and was renamed the \"Royal Canadian Mounted Police\". The new organization was charged with federal law enforcement in all the provinces and territories, and immediately established its modern role as protector of Canadian national security, as well as assuming responsibility for national [[counterintelligence]].\n\nAs part of its national security and intelligence functions, the RCMP infiltrated ethnic or political groups considered to be dangerous to Canada. This included the [[Communist Party of Canada]], but also a variety of minority cultural and nationalist groups. The force was also deeply involved in immigration matters, and especially deportations of suspected radicals. They were especially concerned with [[Ukrainian Canadian|Ukrainian]] groups, both nationalist and socialist.<ref>Hewitt, Steve. \"Policing the Promised Land: The RCMP and Negative Nation-building in Alberta and Saskatchewan in the Interwar Period\", ''The Prairie West as Promised Land'' ed. R. Douglas Francis and Chris Kitzan (Calgary: University of Calgary Press, 2007), 318-320.</ref> The [[Chinese Canadian|Chinese community]] was also targeted because of disproportionate links to [[opium den]]s. Historians estimate fully two percent of the Chinese community was deported between 1923 and 1932, largely under the provisions of the ''Opium and Narcotics Drugs Act'' (ONDA).<ref>Hewitt, 322</ref> Besides the RCMP's new responsibilities in intelligence, drugs enforcement, and immigration, the force also assisted numerous other federal agencies with tasks such as enforcing the [[Canadian Indian residential school system|residential school]] system for [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal children]].\n[[File:RCMP 1935 postcard.jpg|thumb|upright|Mountie, c.1935]]\nIn 1935, the RCMP, collaborating with the [[Regina Police Service]], crushed the [[On-to-Ottawa Trek]] by sparking the Regina Riot, in which one city police officer and one protester were killed. The Trek, which had been organized to call attention to the abysmal conditions in relief camps, therefore failed to reach Ottawa, but nevertheless had profound political reverberations. The RCMP also lost four officers in Saskatchewan and Alberta that year in what became the [[1935 Royal Canadian Mounted Police Killings]].\n\nThe RCMP employed [[special constable]]s to assist with [[Strike action|strikebreaking]] in the interwar period. For a brief period in the late 1930s, a volunteer militia group, the [[Legion of Frontiersmen]], were affiliated with the RCMP. Many members of the RCMP belonged to this organization, which was prepared to serve as an auxiliary force. In later years, special constables performed duties such as policing airports and, in some Canadian provinces, the courthouses.\n\nIn 1932 saw the men, vehicles and vessels of the Customs Preventive Service, National Revenue, absorbed by the RCMP. This created the Marine Section and the Excise Section.<ref>McIntosh, Dave.

This led to the [[Royal Commission of Inquiry into Certain Activities of the RCMP]], better known as the \"McDonald Commission\", named for the presiding judge, Justice David Cargill McDonald. The commission recommended that the force's intelligences duties be removed in favour of the creation of a separate intelligence agency, the [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]] (CSIS).\n\n===Modern era===\n[[File:Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Sunset Ceremony 2012.jpg|thumb|Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Sunset Ceremony 2012]]\nIn 1993, the [[Special Emergency Response Team]] (SERT), were transferred to the [[Canadian Forces]] (CF), creating a new unit called [[Joint Task Force 2]] (JTF2).

Members wear the review order during the [[Musical Ride]], an equestrian drill in which mounted members show their riding skills and handling of the cavalry lance. On normal duties, the RCMP uses standard police methods, equipment, and uniforms. The RCMP uses horses for ceremonial operations such as escorting the governor general's open [[landau (carriage)|landau]] to the opening of Parliament.\n\n===Tunic===\nThe [[red coat (military uniform)|Red Serge tunic]] that identified the NWMP and later the RNWMP and RCMP, is the standard British military pattern. In the original version, worn from 1873 to 1876, it was based on the civilian [[Norfolk jacket]]<ref>{{cite book|first=David|last=Ross|pages=21\u201322|title=The Royal Canadian Mounted Police 1873-1987|isbn=0-85045-834-X|date=March 24, 1988}}</ref>\n.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/hist/hnud-nhut/nwmp-pcno-uni-eng.htm North-West Mounted Police Uniform - Royal Canadian Mounted Police].

Retrieved on 2014-04-12.</ref> Originally kitted from [[militia]] stores, the NWMP later adopted a standard style that emphasized the force's British heritage and differentiated it from the blue American military uniforms. In 1904, dark blue shoulder straps and collars replaced the uniform's scarlet facings<ref>{{cite book|first=David|last=Ross|page=36|title=The Royal Canadian Mounted Police 1873\u20131987|isbn=-0-85045-834-X|date=March 24, 1988}}</ref> when King Edward VII granted the Force \"Royal\" status for its service in the [[Second Boer War]]. Today, RCMP personnel under the rank of inspector wear blue \"[[gorget]]\" patches on the collar, while officers from inspector to commissioner wear solid blue collars and blue pointed-sleeve cuffs.\n\nMembers once wore a white [[haversack]] on top of this jacket and white [[Gauntlet (glove)|gauntlets]],<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> which contrasted with the red tunic. The modern dress uniform replaces these easily dirtied items with brown leather riding gloves and carrying pouches on the belt.\n\n===Hat===\nAlthough the NWMP contingent at [[Queen Victoria]]'s [[Diamond Jubilee]] wore the campaign hat, it only became official in 1904.\n\nA campaign hat is a broad-brimmed [[felt]] or straw hat, with a high crown, pinched symmetrically at the four corners (Montana crown).\n\nThe hat is most commonly worn as part of a uniform by such agencies as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the [[New Zealand Army]], [[National Park Service|United States Park Rangers]], and Scouts. The RCMP did not adopt it until about 1904. The original primary summer headdress was the white British foreign service helmet, also known as a [[pith helmet]]. This was an impractical choice for the [[Western Canada|Canadian west]], and RCMP members wore a Stetson type hat on patrol and around camp. [[Sam Steele]] is often credited with introducing the Stetson-type hat, and when he left the force to command [[Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians)|Lord Strathcona's Horse]] in South Africa, his unit adopted the Stetson. During winter, members wore a [[Canadian military fur wedge cap]] or [[Busby (military headdress)|busby]]. In British Columbia, the hat features a black bearskin rim belt.\n\n===Breeches===\nThe NWMP wore [[buff (colour)|buff]] or steel grey breeches until they adopted dark blue breeches with yellow-gold strapping (stripes) in 1876.<ref>{{cite book|first=David|last=Ross|page=26|title=The Royal Canadian Mounted Police 1873-1987|isbn=0-85045-834-X|date=March 24, 1988}}</ref> Members often exchanged kit with U.S. cavalry units, and while some believe this was the source for the breeches, the NWMP considered adopting blue breeches with a white strap. Dark blue with yellow-gold strapping is a British cavalry tradition, and most cavalry (later armoured) regiments' dress uniforms feature yellow stripes.\n\n===Boots===\nBlack riding boots changed to the modern brown style called \"Strathcona boots\" or informally as \"high browns\" and the original crossbelts changed to the brown Sam Browne type. The brown colour of the boots and belt the RCMP wear with the Red Serge are from members who applied coats of polish, often during training at Depot Division.\n\n===Spurs===\nThe RCMP's original spurs, known as \"long shank spurs,\" were solid nickel. Their owners occasionally had their regimental number engraved on the inside, and some replaced the [[rowel]] with a US [[buffalo nickel]] {{citation needed|date=May 2016}} to complement the Mounted Police capbadge and avoid using a Canadian coin that would deface the monarch. The RCMP last issued long shank spurs in 1968.\n\nSidearms are standard now, but were often not worn in the early years.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n=== Operational uniform ===\n[[File:RCMP in regular uniform.jpg|thumb|right|upright|RCMP in everyday uniform]]\n[[File:RCMP shoulder flash.png|thumb|Closeup of shoulder flash on sleeve of operational uniform]]\nThe operational uniform is a grey shirt, dark blue trousers with gold stripping, regular patrol boots called \"[[ankle boots]]\", regular duty equipment, and a [[peaked cap|regular policeman's style cap]]. Members on operational duty wear a blue [[Gore-Tex]] open-collar jacket ([[patrol jacket]]), while [[Sergeant-major|sergeants major]] and certain [[non-commissioned officer]]s (NCOs) involved in recruit training or media relations wear a dark blue jacket (blue serge). Depending on their duties, officers wear white shirts and the patrol jacket or blue serge. During the summer, officers wear a short-sleeved shirt. Winter dress is a long-sleeved shirt. A tie is worn on occasion for events such as testifying in court. In colder weather, members may wear heavier boots, winter coats ([[storm coat]]s) and a fur cap or toque.\n\nIn 1990, Baltej Singh Dhillon became the RCMP's first [[Sikh]] officer to be allowed to wear a [[turban]] instead of the traditional [[Campaign hat#Royal Canadian Mounted Police|Stetson]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/1990-sikh-mounties-permitted-to-wear-turbans|title=1990: Sikh Mounties permitted to wear turbans|publisher=CBC Archives|accessdate=3 February 2017}}</ref> On March 15, the federal government, despite protests, decided they would allow Sikhs to wear [[Dastar|their religious headgear]] while on duty as RCMP officers, as had been the practice for Sikh members of [[Canadian Forces]] for decades.\n\nDespite ongoing pressure from groups such as the [[Association for the Protection of Fur-Bearing Animals]],<ref>[http://www.furbearerdefenders.com/index.php/campaigns/rcmp-hats RCMP Hats] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101045029/http://www.furbearerdefenders.com/index.php/campaigns/rcmp-hats |date=November 1, 2013 }}.

The force raised the Canadian Mounted Rifles, mostly from NWMP members, for service in South Africa. For the CMR's distinguished service there, King Edward VII honoured the NWMP by changing the name to the \"Royal Northwest Mounted Police\" (RNWMP) on June 24, 1904.\n\nDuring the First World War, the Royal Northwest Mounted Police (RNWMP) conducted [[Border#Jurisdictional borders|border]] patrols, [[surveillance]] of enemy [[Alien (law)|alien]]s, and enforcement of [[national security]] regulations within Canada. However, RNWMP officers also served overseas. On August 6, 1914, a [[Squadron (army)|squadron]] of volunteers from the RNWMP was formed to serve with the Canadian Light Horse in France. In 1918, two more squadrons were raised, A Squadron for service in France and [[Flanders]] and B Squadron for service in the [[Canadian Siberian Expeditionary Force]].\n\nIn September 1939, at the outset of the Second World War, the Canadian Army had no military police. Five days after war was declared the Royal Canadian Mounted Police received permission to form a provost company of force volunteers. It was designated \"No. 1 Provost Company (RCMP)\", and became the [[Canadian Provost Corps]]. Six months after war was declared its members were overseas in Europe and served throughout the [[World War II|Second World War]] as [[Canadian Forces Military Police|military police]].\n\n===Honours===\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police were accorded the status of a regiment of dragoons in 1921.

However, they are given peace officer powers when on duty with a regular member (RM). Their duties consist mainly of assisting RMs in routine events, for example cordoning off crime scene areas, crowd control, participating in [[Neighborhood watch|community policing]], assistance during situations where regular members might be overwhelmed with their duties (e.g., keeping watch of a backseat detainee while RM interviews a victim). They are identified by the wording of \"RCMP Auxiliary\" on cars, jackets and shoulder flashes\n\n;[[Special Constable#Canada|Special constable]]s (S/Cst.): Employees of the RCMP have varied duties depending on where they are deployed, but are often given this designation because of an expertise they possess which needs to be applied in a certain area. For example, an Aboriginal person might be appointed a special constable in order to assist regular members as they police an Aboriginal community where English is not well understood, and where the special constable speaks the language well. They still perform this role today in many isolated northern communities and the RCMP has 122 special constables who are active in the RCMP today, and they are drawn almost entirely from the same Aboriginal communities that they serve.\n\n:From the early years of policing in northern Canada, and well into the 1950s, local aboriginal people were hired by the RCMP as special constables and were employed as guides and to obtain and care for sled dog teams. Many of these former special constables still reside in the north to this day and are still involved in regimental functions of the RCMP.\n\n;Civilian members of the RCMP: While not delegated the powers of police officers, they are instead hired for their specialized scientific, technological, communications and administrative skills. Since the RCMP is a multi-faceted law enforcement organization with responsibilities for federal, provincial and municipal policing duties, it offers employment opportunities for civilian members as professional partners within Canada's national police force.\n\nCivilian members represent approximately 14% of the total RCMP employee population, and are employed within RCMP establishments in most geographical areas of Canada. The following is a list of the most common categories of employment that may be available to interested and qualified individuals.\n\n*Operations\n** Telecommunications operator ([[dispatcher]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/recruiting-recrutement/cm-mc/teleops-opstele-eng.htm |title=Telecommunications Operators |publisher=rcmp-grc.gc.ca |date=July 30, 2010 |accessdate=September 1, 2010}}</ref>\n* Scientific\n** [[Toxicology]]\n** [[Chemistry]]\n** [[Biology]] \u2013 [[DNA]]\n** [[Law]]\n*Technical\n** Forensic identification services\n** Instrument technology\n** [[questioned document examination|Document examination]]\n** Counterfeit analysis\n** Firearms technology\n** Electronics technology\n** [[Information technology]]\n** [[Communication]]s\n** Computer systems development\n** [[Telecommunication]]s\n** Information services/public affairs\n* [[Administration of business|Administrative]]\n** Policy development and analysis\n** Staff development and training\n** [[Human resource management]]\n** [[Translation]]\n** Police Records Information Management Environment (PRIME-BC)\n\n;Public service employees: Also referred to as public servants, PSes or PSEs, they provide much of the administrative support for the RCMP in the form of detachment clerks and other administrative support at the headquarters level. They are not police officers, do not wear a uniform, have no police authority and are not bound by the ''RCMP Act''.\n\n;Municipal employees:\nAbbreviated as \"ME\" they are found in RCMP detachments where a contract exists with a municipality to provide front-line policing. MEs are not actually employees of the RCMP, but are instead employed by the local municipality to work in the RCMP detachment. They conduct the same duties that a PSE would and are required to meet the same reliability and security clearance to do so. Many detachment buildings house a combination of municipally and provincially funded detachments, and therefore there are often PSEs and MEs found working together in them.\n\n===Ranks===\nThe rank system of the RCMP is partly a result of their origin as a [[paramilitary]] force. Upon its founding, the RCMP adopted the rank insignia of the [[Canadian Army]] (which in turn came from the [[British Army]]), which is almost identical to that of the current Canadian Army. Like in a military, the RCMP also has a distinction between commissioned and non-commissioned officers. The non-commissioned ranks are mostly based on military ranks (apart from constable). Non-commissioned officer ranks above staff sergeant resemble those that formerly existed in the Canadian Army, but have since been replaced by [[warrant officer]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uniforminsignia.org/?option=com_insigniasearch&Itemid=53&result=552|title=Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP\u00a8) / Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) / Gendarmerie royale du Canada (GRC)|publisher=}}</ref> The commissioned officer ranks, by contrast, use a set of non-military titles that are often used in Commonwealth police services. The number of higher ranks like chief superintendent and deputy commissioner have been added on and increased since the formation of the force, while the lower commissioned rank of sub-inspector has been dropped.\n\nThe numbers are current as of April 1, 2019:<ref>{{cite web|last1=Government of Canada |first1=Royal Canadian Mounted Police|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/about-ausujet/organi-eng.htm|title=Organizational Structure |website=www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca |accessdate=17 May 2019 |date=1 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"6\" |Commissioned officers\n|-\n!Commissioner\n!Deputy commissioner\n!Assistant commissioner\n!Chief superintendent\n!Superintendent\n!Inspector\n|-\n!{{lang|fr|Commissaire}}\n!{{lang|fr|Sous-commissaire}}\n!{{lang|fr|Commissaire adjoint}}\n!{{lang|fr|Surintendant principal}}\n!{{lang|fr|Surintendant}}\n!{{lang|fr|Inspecteur}}\n|-\n!Commr.\n!D/Commr.\n!A/Commr.\n!C/Supt.\n!Supt.\n!Insp.\n|-\n!1\n!6\n!33\n!55\n!186\n!331\n|-\n|[[File:RCMP Commissioner.png|center|frameless|150x150px]]\n|[[File:RCMP Deputy Commissioner.png|center|frameless|150x150px]]\n|[[File:RCMP Assistant Commissioner.png|center|frameless|150x150px]]\n|[[File:RCMP Chief Superintendent.png|center|frameless|150x150px]]\n|[[File:RCMP Superintendent.png|center|frameless|150x150px]]\n|[[File:RCMP Inspector.png|center|frameless|150x150px]]\n|}\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/en/regular-member-annual-rates-pay|title=Regular Member - Annual Rates of Pay {{!}} Royal Canadian Mounted Police|last=Government of Canada|first=Royal Canadian Mounted Police|date=2012-09-14|website=www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca|access-date=2019-07-17}}</ref> these are the official abbreviations for the Commissioned Officers and also the Non-Commissioned officers in the RCMP.

Depending on the dress, badges are worn on the shoulder as slip-ons, on shoulder boards, or directly on the [[epaulette]]s. The lower ranks are non-commissioned officers and the insignia continues to be based on pre-1968 Canadian Army patterns. Since 1990, the non-commissioned officers' rank insignia has been embroidered on the epaulette slip-ons. Non-commissioned rank badges are worn on the right sleeve of the scarlet/blue tunic and blue jacket. The constables wear no rank insignia. There are also 122 special constables, as well as a varying number of reserve constables, auxiliary constables, and students who wear identifying insignia.\n\nThe [[Bath star|star]], or \"pip\", used in the insignia of commissioned officers represents the military Knight Grand Cross of the [[Order of the Bath]]. The Order's motto ({{lang|la|tria juncta in uno}}, \"three joined in one\", referring to the [[holy trinity]]) is inscribed in a band in the middle of it. The three crowns inset in the centre not only represent the Christian Trinity, but also the three former kingdoms that became the United Kingdom. The RCMP formerly had subaltern ([[junior officer]]) ranks that were indicated by one \"pip\" for a sub-inspector (equivalent to an army second lieutenant) to three \"pips\" for an inspector (equivalent to an army captain).<ref>p.38 Ross, David & May Robin ''The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (1873-1987)'' 1988 Osprey Publishing.</ref> A reorganization in 1960 changed the insignia to three \"pips\" for sub-inspectors<ref>pp.38-39 Ross, David & May, Robin ''The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (1873-1987)'' 1988 Osprey Publishing.</ref> and a crown for inspectors,<ref>pp.38-39 Ross, David & May, Robin ''The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (1873-1987)'' 1988 Osprey Publishing</ref> making the latter a [[field officer]] rank. The rank of sub-inspector was abolished in 1990, leaving the RCMP with no subaltern ranks.\n\nA royal crown is used in the regimental cap badge and the insignia of senior commissioned officers. In 1955 [[St. Edward's Crown]] replaced the [[Tudor Crown]]. Although Queen Elizabeth II had adopted the redesign of the heraldic crown in 1953, it took some time to design, approve, and manufacture the new insignia.\n\nThe crossed [[Mameluke]] [[Kilij|sabre]] and [[Baton (military)|baton]] is the insignia for [[general officer]]s. In the RCMP it designates the commissioner (equivalent to an Army general) and their subordinate deputy commissioners (equivalent to Army lieutenant-generals). The assistant commissioners use the crown-over-three-pips insignia of an Army [[Brigadier#British tradition|brigadier]].\n\nThe brass shoulder title pin on the epaulettes was changed from \"RCMP\" to \"GRC-RCMP\" in 1968. ({{lang|fr|GRC}} stands for {{lang|fr|Gendarmerie royale du Canada}}, the RCMP's French-language title). This was due to a 1968 ruling stating that all statutes had to be published bilingually in both English and French. As a law enforcement agency, the RCMP had to use ranks and titles in both languages. This was later reinforced by the [[Official Languages Act (Canada)|Official Languages Act of 1969]].\n\n==Equipment and vehicles==\n[[File:G20 Toronto - RCMP Truck.jpg|thumb|RCMP truck at the G20 summit in Toronto]]\n\n===Land fleet===\nThe RCMP Land Transport Fleet inventory includes:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/land-terre/index-eng.htm |title=Land Transport |publisher=Rcmp-grc.gc.ca |date=November 14, 2006 |accessdate=May 22, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620013431/http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/land-terre/index-eng.htm |archivedate=June 20, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n* [[Police car|Cars]]: 5,330\n* Unmarked vehicles: 2,811\n* Light [[Police truck|trucks]]: 2,090\n* Heavy trucks: 123 \n* SUVs: 616 \n* [[Police motorcycle|Motorcycles]]: 34\n* Small snowmobiles: 481\n* All-terrain vehicles: 181\n* Gas railway cars: 1\n* Tractors: 27\n* [[Police bus|Buses]]: 3\n* Total: 11,697\n\n===Marine craft===\n[[File:Toronto police boats on lake.JPG|thumb|RCMP-CCG vessel ''Simmonds'' with CCGS ''Cape Hurd'']]\nThe RCMP polices [[Canadian Internal Waters]], including the [[Territorial waters|territorial sea]] and contiguous zone as well as the [[Great Lakes]] and [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]]; such operations are provided by the RCMP's Federal Services Directorate and includes enforcing Canada's environment, fisheries, customs and immigration laws.

The Ross Mk I was issued from 1905 to 1907 and the improved Ross Mk II was in testing from 1909 to 1912.<ref name=\"calibremag.ca\"/> The Mk I design was accepted by the Canadian Militia in 1903. The NWMP looked at acquiring the Ross to replace the Winchester and Lee-Metford and ordered 1000. Production problems led to delays until 1904; the most glaring being that the finished product did not match their original specifications.<ref name=\"calibremag.ca\"/> The NWMP demanded their contract carbines use a different set of iron sight (which later became standard on the Mk II) which delayed production for a further year.<ref name=\"calibremag.ca\"/> The carbines received in 1905 were plagued with quality control problems that made them more fragile than the weapons they were to replace.

Its small size made it a handy backup pistol. Most were originally procured to arm NWMP constables assigned to protecting mail cars on trains. The constables would sometimes \"absent-mindedly forget\" to hand the pistols back afterwards.\n\n;'''Sidearms'''\n* 1821 pattern Light Cavalry Sabre - Originally part of a trove of old swords given by the Canadian Militia to the NWMP as weapons.

None of these swords were ever used ceremonially, and were strictly collectibles.  Wilkinson Sword also made a commemorative centennial [[tomahawk (axe)|tomahawk]] and miniature \"letter opener\" models of their centennial swords.\n\nIn 1973, [[Winchester Repeating Arms Company]] produced an RCMP commemorative centennial version of their [[Winchester Model 1894|Model 94]] rifle in [[.30-30 Winchester]], with a {{convert|22|in|mm|abbr=on}} round barrel. The [[Receiver (firearms)|receiver]], buttplate, and [[Forend (firearms)|forend]] cap (on the musket-style forend) were plated in gold. Commemorative medallions were embedded in the right-hand side of the [[Stock (firearms)|stock]], with an \"MP\" engraving. There was engraving on the barrel and receiver indicating the rifle was a centennial commemorative edition. Sights were open notch rear, with a flip-up rear ladder, graduated to {{convert|2000|yd|m|abbr=on}}. Two versions were produced, 9500 with serial numbers beginning \"RCMP\" for commercial sale, 5000 with the prefix \"MP\" sold only to serving RCMP members. In addition, ten presentation models were produced, serialled RCMP1P to RCMP10P.

Coupled with the adage that the Mountie \"always gets his man,\" the image projects them as fearsome, incorruptible, dogged yet gentle champions of the law.

Mounties fiction became a popular genre in both [[pulp magazine]]s and book form. Among the best-selling authors who specialized in tales of the Mounted Police were [[James Oliver Curwood]], [[Laurie York Erskine]], James B Hendryx, T Lund, Harwood Steele (the son of Sam Steele), and William Byron Mowery.\n\nIn other media, a famous example is the [[Radio drama|radio]] and [[Television program|television series]], ''[[Challenge of the Yukon|Sergeant Preston of the Yukon]].'' [[Dudley Do-Right]] (of ''[[The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show]]'') is a 1960s example of the comic aspect of the Mountie myth, as is [[Klondike Kat]], from [[Total Television]]. The [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical and Hollywood movie ''[[Rose Marie (1936 film)|Rose-Marie]]'' is a 1930s example of its romantic side. A successful combination were a series of ''[[Renfrew of the Royal Mounted]]'' boy's adventure novels written by Laurie York Erskine beginning in 1922 running to 1941. In the 1930s Erskine narrated a ''Sgt Renfrew of the Mounties'' radio show and a series of films with actor-singer James Newill playing Renfrew were released between 1937 and 1940. In 1953 portions of the films were mixed with new sequences of Newill for a ''Renfrew of the Mounted'' television series.\n\nBruce Carruthers  (b.1901\u2013d.1953), a former Mounted Police corporal (1919\u20131923), served as an unofficial [[technical advisor]] to Hollywood in many films with RCMP characters.<ref>Barr, William ''Red Serge and Polar Bear Pants\" The Biography of Harry Stallworthy, RCMP'' University of Alberta Press 2004</ref> They included ''Heart of the North'' (1938), ''Susannah of the Mounties'' (1939), ''Northern Pursuit'' (1943), ''Gene Autry and The Mounties'' (1951), ''The Wild North'' (1952), and ''The Pony Soldier'' (1952).\n\n===Modern culture===\nIn 1959, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] aired [[R.C.M.P. (TV series)|''R.C.M.P.'']], a half-hour dramatic series about an RCMP detachment keeping the peace and fighting crime. Filmed in black and white, in and around Ottawa by [[F. R. Crawley|Crawley Films]], the series was co-produced with the [[BBC]] and the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] and ran for 39 episodes. It was noted for its pairing of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois and Anglo officers.\n\nCanadians also poke fun at the RCMP with [[Dave Broadfoot|Sergeant Renfrew]] and his faithful dog Cuddles in various sketches produced by the ''[[Royal Canadian Air Farce]]'' comedy troupe. On ''[[That '70s Show]]'' Mounties were played by [[Second City Television|SCTV]] alumni [[Joe Flaherty]] and [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]]. The British have also exploited the myth: the BBC television series ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' featured a group of Mounties singing the chorus in ''[[The Lumberjack Song]]'' in the [[lumberjack]] sketch.\n\nThe 1972\u201390 CBC series ''[[The Beachcombers]]'' features a character named Constable John Constable who attempts to enforce the law in the town of [[Gibsons, British Columbia]].\n\nIn comic books, the [[Marvel Comics]] characters of [[Alpha Flight]] are described on several occasions as \"RCMP auxiliaries,\" and two of their members, [[Snowbird (comics)|Snowbird]] and the second [[Major Mapleleaf]] are depicted as serving members of the force. In the latter case, due to trademark issues, Major Mapleleaf is described as a \"Royal Canadian Mountie\" in the opening roll call pages of each issue of ''Alpha Flight'' he appears in.\n\n[[Charles Bronson]] and [[Lee Marvin]] starred in the 1981 movie ''[[Death Hunt]]'' that fictionalized the RCMP pursuit of [[Albert Johnson (criminal)|Albert Johnson]].\n\nIn the early 1990s, Canadian [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] [[Jacques Rougeau]] utilized the [[List of professional wrestling terms#G|gimmick]] of \"The Mountie\" while wrestling for the [[WWE|WWF]]. He typically wore the Red Serge to the ring, and carried a [[Cattle prod|shock stick]] as an illegal weapon. As his character was portrayed as an [[Heel (professional wrestling)|evil]] Mountie, the RCMP ultimately won an injunction preventing Rougeau from wrestling as this character in Canada, though he was not prevented from doing so outside the country. He briefly held the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]] in 1992.\n\nThe 1998 [[swan song]] of [[Nick Berry]]'s time on UK drama ''[[Heartbeat (UK TV series)|Heartbeat]]'' features his character, Sergeant Nick Rowan, transferring to Canada and taking the rank of constable in the Mounties. The special telemovie was titled ''Heartbeat: Changing Places.''\n\nThe 1994\u201398 TV series ''[[Due South]]'' pairs Mountie Constable Benton Fraser with streetwise American detective Ray Vecchio cleaning up the streets of Chicago. It mainly derives its entertainment from the [[stereotype|perceived differences]] in attitude and culture between these two countries' police forces. Fraser is depicted as honest and polite to a fault, even refusing to carry a loaded sidearm when \"assisting\" Detective Vecchio, but almost superhuman in his abilities for thwarting crime.\n\nA pair of Mounties staff the RCMP detachment in the fictional town of [[Lynx River]], Northwest Territories, in the CBC series ''[[North of 60]].'' The series, which aired from 1992 to 1998, is about events in the mostly indigenous community, but the Mounties feature prominently in each episode.\n\nAnother TV series from the 1990s, ''[[Bordertown (1989 TV series)|Bordertown]]'' features an NWMP corporal paired with a [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. marshal]] securing law and order on a frontier U.S.\u2013Canada border town. In the ABC TV mini-series ''[[Answered by Fire]],'' at least three mounties are featured. Mounties also appear in the TV series ''[[When Calls the Heart]]'' (Hallmark Channel).\n\nThe 1987 [[Brian De Palma]] film ''[[The Untouchables (film)|The Untouchables]]'' features cooperation between the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]] task force, led by [[Eliot Ness]], and the Mounties against liquor smuggling across the [[Canada\u2013United States border]].\n\nThe 1995 album ''[[C'est Cheese]]'' by Canadian musical comedy group [[The Arrogant Worms]] includes \"The Mountie Song\", which tells the story of a dissatisfied Mountie.\n\nIn his 1999, album ''[[Soiree]]'' Newfoundland musician A. Frank Willis included \"Savage Cop in Savage Cove\" which was based on a true story and went on to become a big hit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tidespoint.com/music/afrankwillis.shtml|title=Newfoundland music books food videos images arts crafts|access-date=October 25, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918111453/http://www.tidespoint.com/music/afrankwillis.shtml|archive-date=September 18, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nFrom 2011, the [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] fantasy drama series ''[[The Listener (TV series)|The Listener]]'' regularly features characters who work for the Integrated Investigative Bureau, a fictional division of the RCMP that brings together various specialists, officers and civilian consultants to work on high-profile or federal cases. Although characters in the employ of the IIB are rarely, if ever, depicted wearing uniform, they are often addressed by their ranks \u2013 two main characters are Sergeant Michelle McClusky and Corporal Dev Clark.\n\n===Mountie merchandise and trademark===\nThere are products and merchandise that are made in the image of the RCMP, like Mounties statues or hats. Before 1995, the RCMP had little control over these products.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police received an international licence on April 1, 1995, requiring those who use the RCMP to pay a licensing fee. Proceeds from the fees are used for community awareness programmes.<ref>{{cite news|last=Farnsworth |first=Clyde H. |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CEEDE133CF937A35751C0A963958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |title=For the Mounties, Justice Is Now a Licensing Fee\u2014New York Times |newspaper=New York Times |date=February 4, 1995 |accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref> Those that do not pay the licensing fee are legally unable to use the name of the RCMP or their correct uniforms, though a film such as ''[[Canadian Bacon]]'' used the name \"Royal Mounted Canadian Police\" and the character in the ''[[Dudley Do-Right (film)|Dudley Do-Right]]'' film did not wear accurate insignia.\n\nThrough a Master Licensing Agreement (MLA) with the RCMP, the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police Foundation|RCMP Foundation]] is responsible for managing the commercial use of the RCMP name, image, and protected marks.<ref>Royal Canadian Mounted Police, \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20071023111746/http://www.bookrags.com/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police]\", Retrieved July 28, 2011</ref> The foundation issues selected companies a royalty-based agreement allowing them to produce and market high-quality official RCMP merchandise.

In 2007, through a decree signed by Commissioner Beverley Busson, the operating name was changed to the \"Royal Canadian Mounted Police Foundation\".\n\nThe [[RCMP Heritage Centre]] is a multi-million dollar museum designed by [[Arthur Erickson]] that opened May 2007 in Regina, Saskatchewan, at the RCMP Academy, Depot Division. It replaced the old RCMP museum and is designed to celebrate the role of the force in Canada's history.\n\n===RCMP Bands===\n[[File:Cornemuse 2.jpg|thumb|Although the official band of the RCMP has disbanded, several small RCMP pipe bands such as this one still remain.]]\n[[File:Canada. Mounties Band, Yukon, 1901.jpg|thumb|A Mounties Band in [[Yukon]], 1901.]]\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police Band ({{Lang-fr|La Musique de la Gendarmerie royale du Canada}}) was considered one of the best professional bands assembled in Canada. Although it was an official regimental band, the members worked in the band as a secondary job. It is generally considered to have begun in 1938, though there were various police bands in the RCMP that flourished at the time, leading the [[Canadian government]] granting approval for the creation of a full-time central band in December 1958, with its headquarters in the capital of [[Ottawa]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Luscombe |first1=Stephen |title=Royal Canadian Mounted Police |url=https://www.britishempire.co.uk/forces/armyunits/canadiancavalry/rcmpbands.htm |website=www.britishempire.co.uk}}</ref><ref name=\"Altissimo\">{{cite web |title=The Royal Canadian Mounted Police Band |url=https://militarymusic.com/blogs/military-music/13516489-the-royal-canadian-mounted-police-band |website=Altissimo! |language=en}}</ref> Appearances made by the band included [[Expo 86]] and the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings|Commonwealth Conference]] in [[Vancouver]], the [[Calgary Winter Olympics]] in 1988, as well as the visits of [[Soviet President]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and Queen [[Elizabeth II]] in 1990.<ref name=Altissimo/><ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=https://rcmpband.ca/history/ |website=RCMP Band |language=en |date=26 April 2014}}</ref> It was dissolved in 1994 due to government budget cuts.\n\nIn its 55 year existence, it operated as a voluntary regimental band, with its members working with it as a secondary job apart from their other duties in the RCMP. Members of the band wore the RCMP's notable [[Red Serge]] as part of their [[full dress uniform]] and adopted drill seen in [[Canadian military bands]] and bands in the [[British Army]]. Its longest serving director was Superintendent Edwin Joseph Lydall who served from 1948 to 1968.<ref>http://canadianobits.com/ontario/webbbs_config.pl/noframes/read/427</ref> \n\nToday, instead of brass and reed bands, the RCMP sports eight regional pipe bands across the major cities of the 10 provinces. The first of these bands were established in 1992 in [[Alberta]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/pd-ct/index-eng.htm |title=RCMP Community Bands of Pipes and Drums\n |publisher=RCMP |accessdate=December 7, 2019}}</ref> The following are the locations of the regional volunteer pipe bands:\n\n*[[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]]\n*[[Moncton]]\n*[[Montreal]] (part of [[The Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Quebec|\"C\" Division]])\n*[[Ottawa]]\n*[[Winnipeg]]\n*[[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]] (part of \"F\" Division)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rcmpregina.tripod.com/id12.html |title=Band Information: A Community Partnership |publisher=RCMP Regina Pipes and Drums|accessdate=December 7, 2019}}</ref>\n*[[Edmonton]]\n*[[Vancouver]] (part of [[RCMP \"E\" Division|\"E\" Division]])<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rcmppipeband.com/history_bc.htm |title=History \u2014 \"E\" Division |publisher=RCMP \"E\" Division Pipe Band (British Columbia)|accessdate=December 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThese bands act as \"garrison bands\" for the provincial division.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rcmppipeband.ca/ |title=Pipes, Drums and Dancers: Nova Scotia |accessdate=December 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===RCMP Tartan===\n[[File:RCMP Tartan.png|thumb|The RCMP Tartan]]\nThe RCMP has since 1998 had its own distinctive [[tartan]]. The creation of the tartan was the result of a committee created in the early 1990s to create a tartan by its 125th anniversary. Upon approval from commissioner Phillip Murray, the tartan was registered with the [[Scottish Tartans Society]] and presented to the agency by [[Anne, Princess Royal|Anne the Princess Royal]] during her [[Royal tours of Canada by the Canadian Royal Family|royal visit to Canada]] in 1998. The tartan appeared for the first time by a RCMP pipe band at the [[Royal Nova Scotia International Tattoo]] in July and August of 1998.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/en/tartan |title=Tartan |publisher=Royal Canadian Mounted Police |accessdate=December 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Controversies and criticism==\n{{Further|List of controversies involving the Royal Canadian Mounted Police}}\nAmerican historian Andrew Graybill has argued that the Mounted Police historically resembled the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] in many ways.  He argues that each protected the established order by confining and removing Indians, by tightly controlling the mixed blood peoples (the African Americans in Texas and the M\u00e9tis in Canada), assisted the large-scale ranchers against the small-scale ranchers and farmers who fenced the land, and broke the power of labour unions that tried to organize the workers of industrial corporations.<ref>Andrew R.

Some Canadian activist groups have called for an end to the RCMP training.<ref name=\"Haiti\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20041021054518/http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/news/cida_rcmp_e.htm RCMP Website] and [https://archive.today/20070802045522/http://www.rabble.ca/news_full_story.shtml?x=44206 \"Haiti Support Hits the Streets\"]</ref> The RCMP has also provided training overseas in [[Iraq]] and other peace-keeping missions.\n\nIn October 2016, the RCMP issued an apology for harassment, discrimination, and sexual abuse of female officers and civilian members. Additionally they set aside a $100 million fund to compensate these victims. Over 20,000 current and past female employees that were employed after 1974 are eligible.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=Kathleen|title=RCMP could pay up to $100M to female employees who were sexually harassed, abused|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/rcmp-paulson-compensation-harassment-1.3793785|website=CBC News|accessdate=6 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019 the [[The Guardian|Guardian]] made public, that RCMP planned to have \u201clethal overwatch\u201d while clearing protesters, to grant a gas company access to [[First Nations|First nation]] [[Wet\u02bcsuwet\u02bcen|Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en]] lands <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/20/canada-indigenous-land-defenders-police-documents|title=Exclusive: Canada police prepared to shoot Indigenous activists, documents show|last=Parrish|first=Jaskiran Dhillon Will|date=2019-12-20|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-12-22|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], the civilian complaints review body \n* ''[[Courage in Red]]'', a 13-part documentary about the RCMP\n* [[Emergency Response Team (RCMP)]]\n* [[List of Canadian organizations with royal patronage]]\n* [[RCMP Technical Security Branch]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website}}\n* [https://archives-manuscripts.dartmouth.edu/repositories/2/resources/1025 Royal Canadian Mounted Police Reports 1929-1948] at Dartmouth College Library\n\n{{Law enforcement agencies in Canada}}\n{{Government Departments of Canada}}\n{{Canadian Newsmaker of the Year}}\n{{Police}}\n{{Customs}}\n{{Subject bar |portal= |commons=yes |commons-search=Category:Royal Canadian Mounted Police |species= |species-search= |n=yes |n-search=Category:RCMP |wikt= |wikt-search= |b= |b-search= |q= |q-search= |s=yes |v= |v-search= |voy= |voy-search= |d=yes |d-search=Q335175}}\n{{Portal bar|Canada|Law}}\n{{Coord|45.42|-75.66|type:landmark_region:CA|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Royal Canadian Mounted Police| ]]\n[[Category:Canadian federal departments and agencies]]\n[[Category:Public Safety Canada]]\n[[Category:Canadian intelligence agencies]]\n[[Category:Government agencies established in 1920]]\n[[Category:Legal history of Canada]]\n[[Category:1920 establishments in Canada]]\n[[Category:Gendarmerie]]\n[[Category:Organizations based in Canada with royal patronage]]\n[[Category:Organizations based in Ottawa]]\n[[Category:Uniformed services of Canada]]\n[[Category:Federal law enforcement agencies of Canada]]\n[[Category:Nunavut law]]\n[[Category:Northwest Territories law]]\n[[Category:Yukon law]]\n[[Category:National symbols of Canada]]\n", "name_user": "2607:fea8:3ca0:c47:9525:2044:575c:d113", "label": "vandal", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eHistory)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police"}
