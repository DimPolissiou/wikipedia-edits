It has been the physically smallest Canadian coin since 1922, smaller even than the [[Canadian penny|penny]] despite its higher face value. According to the [[Royal Canadian Mint]], the official national term of the coin is the ''10-cent piece'', but in practice, the term ''dime'' predominates in English-speaking Canada. It is nearly identical in size to the [[Dime (United States coin)|American dime]], but unlike its counterpart, the Canadian dime is [[Ferromagnetism|magnetic]] due to a distinct metal composition: from 1968 to 1999 it was composed entirely of [[nickel]], and since 2000 it has been steel-plated with layers of nickel and copper.\n\nCurrently the dime has, as with all Canadian coins, a portrait of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] on the [[obverse]]. The reverse contains a representation of the ''[[Bluenose]]'', a famous Canadian [[schooner]].

On May 2, 1981, the station was sold by the Ankeny Broadcasting company to [[Fuller-Jeffrey Broadcasting]].  After Fuller-Jeffrey acquired the station, the [[call sign|call letters]] were changed to [[KJJY]] and the format to [[country music|country]].\n\nAs KJJY, the station slowly built a following taking on the market's current country giant [[KXNO (AM)|KSO]], which had been the market's country leader on the AM band since 1972.  KJJY also fended off a challenge from [[KIOA|KKXI]] in 1986, asserting its dominance in the FM country market. To better compete in the market, KJJY moved to 92.5 MHz in 1988 and received a power upgrade to 50,000 watts.

This incarnation was owned by Van Oort Communications, and was programmed with a [[beautiful music]]/[[easy listening]] format.  The station was not a huge success, but it maintained a loyal following of listeners.  On June 1, 1998, KMXD was acquired by Clear Channel Communications (now [[iHeartMedia]]); upon acquiring KMXD, the call letters were moved to its new sister station [[KDRB|KLYF]], which was known at the time as \"Mix 100\".  The 106.3 frequency received the new call letters KYSY, rebranded as \"Sunny 106\", and was reprogrammed as an [[adult contemporary music]] station.\n\nSunny 106 was never a top performer in the market, usually behind main rival [[KOEZ (FM)|KLTI]]. On October 1, 1999, the call sign changed to KLYF while keeping the adult contemporary format.  The thought was to bring back a historic name to the market in hopes of turning around the station's fortunes.  In the two years that the station was KLYF, it did quite a bit better than KYSY, but still never lived up to expectations.\n\nAfter the failure of two AC-formatted stations, Clear Channel decided to go in a totally different direction; on September 4, 2001, a new [[Smooth Jazz]] format debuted, marking the first such station in the market. The new call letters were KVJZ and the station was known as \"Smooth Jazz, V106.3.\"  Much like when the station was KMXD, this format never attracted huge numbers, but had a loyal following. \n\n===The Beat and The Bus===\nOn October 31, 2003, the format was changed once again to [[rhythmic contemporary]] and the station became known as KDRB, ''106.3 The Beat''. Although it was the most successful format on the 106.3 frequency since KJJY, it largely cannibalized the audience of sister [[Contemporary hit radio|Mainstream CHR]] station [[KKDM]] rather than attracting new listeners away from competitors.\n\nOn April 1, 2005, the station flipped to [[adult hits]] as ''106.3 The Bus''. The Bus did moderately well, picking up a very loyal fanbase while also maintaining decent ratings.  On May 25, 2006, sister station KMXD started [[simulcast]]ing The Bus.  For a few weeks, they became known as ''100.3 and 106.3 The Bus''.  This arrangement was short-lived, and at noon on June 12, 2006, the [[KDRB]] calls and ''The Bus'' format moved completely to 100.3, replacing KMXD.\n\n===Capital and Alt===\nOn June 12, 2006, the station re-launched as [[adult album alternative]] (AAA) ''Capital 106.3'', and adopted the calls KPTL. The flip marked the first AAA station in [[Des Moines]] since the demise of [[KAZR|KFMG]] in 1996 (KFMG was resurrected on a low-power FM station at 98.9 FM that signed on February 26, 2007; it also has an AAA format).\n\nBy 2011, KPTL shifted its direction from AAA to [[modern adult contemporary]], in an effort to compete with [[hot AC]] rival [[KSTZ]]. This move resulted in KPTL being moved from [[Mediabase]]'s AAA panel to the [[Adult Top 40]] panel. By 2012, KPTL shifted towards a mainstream [[Hot AC]] direction, competing against KSTZ.\n\n [[Image:KPTLlogo2013.png|thumb|Former logo as ''Alt 106.3'', used until 2017.]]\nOn November 1, 2013, the station did an early conversion to a [[Christmas music]] format for the remainder of the year as ''Capital Christmas 106.3''.  Following the holiday, it swapped formats with co-owned [[alternative rock]] station [[KCYZ|KCCQ]] and became ''Alt 106.3''.  On April 4, 2014, KPTL changed its call letters to KDXA.\n\n===KXNO-FM===\nOn January 16, 2020, it was announced that [[sports talk]] sister station [[KXNO (AM)|KXNO]] would add an FM simulcast on KDXA. The station had dismissed its morning and afternoon hosts, as well as several other staff members, as part of national layoffs by iHeartMedia resulting from corporate restructuring.

It tends to be open for special occasions, such as August thirteenth, the feast of St Kasijan.\n\nA small church from the seventeenth century rises on the graveyard. Fragments with \"pleter\" (interlacery ornaments) are incorporated in its door-posts and on the front.\n\nThe ruins of the fifteenth-century summer villa of the archbishops of Zadar can be seen on an islet in the bay.  The earth utilized to form the base of the villa was dredged from the neighborhood Punta, forming a festering tidal pool, known as Lake Suko\u0161an, or Suko\u0161an Jezero.\n\nThe ruins of the mediaeval fortress erected by the counts of Bribir rise on Cape Bribircina.\n\n==Economy==\nChief occupations include farming, viniculture, olive growing, fruit growing and tourism.\n\n==Food==\nIn Suko\u0161an, there is a large variety of restaurants.

The town itself offers nice walks through the traditional narrow alleys.\n\n==Culture==\nSuko\u0161an cherishes the old customs. They are linked to the feast of [[Cassian of Imola|St. Kasijan]], the patron saint of Sukosan (13 August). The Nights of Sukosan is another event offering entertainment. During the carnival season, \"luzari\", masques typical only of Sukosan, represent a special attraction.\n\nDue to its numerous restaurants and taverns, Suko\u0161an is known as a place of drinking wine and singing.\n\n==History==\nThe parish church of St. Kasijan, erected probably in the eleventh century (fragments with [[Croatian interlace|pleter]] motifs - interlacery ornamentation), assumed its present aspect in the seventeenth century. It tends to be open for special occasions, such as August thirteenth, the feast of St Kasijan.\n\nA small church from the seventeenth century rises on the graveyard. Fragments with \"pleter\" (interlacery ornaments) are incorporated in its door-posts and on the front.\n\nThe ruins of the fifteenth-century summer villa of the archbishops of Zadar can be seen on an islet in the bay.  The earth utilized to form the base of the villa was dredged from the neighborhood Punta, forming a festering tidal pool, known as Lake Suko\u0161an, or Suko\u0161an Jezero.\n\nThe ruins of the mediaeval fortress erected by the counts of Bribir rise on Cape Bribircina.\n\n==Economy==\nChief occupations include farming, viniculture, olive growing, fruit growing and tourism.\n\n==Food==\nIn Suko\u0161an, there is a large variety of restaurants. Seafood, such as [[fried calamari]] and [[mussels]], is one of the most common meals in the village.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.sukosan.hr/ Sukosan Tourist Office]\n* [http://www.sukosan.net/ Sukosan]\n* [http://www.gmm-sukosan.com/en/sukosan.php About Sukosan]\n\n{{Cities and Municipalities of Zadar county}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sukosan}}\n[[Category:Municipalities of Croatia]]\n[[Category:Populated coastal places in Croatia]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Zadar County]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suko%C5%A1an"}

Jason Black, the band's bassist did not participate in the writing/recording of the album due to obligations with [[Hot Water Music]], Zack Roach instead performed bass on the album. It is also the last album to feature long time drummer, Dan Trapp, as he parted ways with the band in late 2014.
