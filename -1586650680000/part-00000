Both forms have a single [[Body orifice|orifice]] and body cavity that are used for [[digestion]] and [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]]. Many cnidarian species produce [[Colony (biology)|colonies]] that are single organisms composed of medusa-like or [[polyp (zoology)|polyp]]-like zooids, or both (hence they are [[Trimorphism|trimorphic]]). Cnidarians' activities are coordinated by a decentralized [[nerve net]] and [[Sensory neuron|simple receptors]]. Several free-swimming species of [[Cubozoa]] and [[Scyphozoa]] possess balance-sensing [[statocyst]]s, and some have simple eyes. Not all cnidarians [[sexual reproduction|reproduce sexually]], with many species having complex life cycles of [[asexual reproduction|asexual]] polyp stages and sexual medusae. Some, however, omit either the polyp or the medusa stage.\n\nCnidarians were formerly grouped with [[ctenophore]]s in the phylum [[Coelenterata]], but increasing awareness of their differences caused them to be placed in separate phyla.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dunn|first1=Casey W.|last2=Leys|first2=Sally P.|last3=Haddock|first3=Steven H.D.|title=The hidden biology of sponges and ctenophores|journal=Trends in Ecology & Evolution|date=May 2015|volume=30|issue=5|pages=282\u2013291|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2015.03.003|pmid=25840473}}</ref> Cnidarians are classified into four main groups: the almost wholly [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] [[Anthozoa]] ([[sea anemone]]s, [[coral]]s, [[sea pen]]s); swimming [[Scyphozoa]] ([[jellyfish]]); [[Cubozoa]] (box jellies); and [[Hydrozoa]] (a diverse group that includes all the freshwater cnidarians as well as many marine forms, and has both sessile members, such as ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'', and colonial swimmers, such as the [[Portuguese Man o' War]]).

Since these animals have no heads, their ends are described as \"oral\" (nearest the mouth) and \"aboral\" (furthest from the mouth). \n\nMost have fringes of tentacles equipped with [[Cnidocyte|cnidocytes]] around their edges, and medusae generally have an inner ring of tentacles around the mouth. Some hydroids may consist of colonies of [[zooid]]s that serve different purposes, such as defense, reproduction and catching prey. The [[mesoglea]] of polyps is usually thin and often soft, but that of medusae is usually thick and springy, so that it returns to its original shape after muscles around the edge have contracted to squeeze water out, enabling medusae to swim by a sort of [[jet propulsion]].<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n===Skeletons===\nIn medusae the only supporting structure is the [[mesoglea]]. ''[[hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'' and most [[sea anemone]]s close their mouths when they are not feeding, and the water in the digestive cavity then acts as a [[hydrostatic skeleton]], rather like a water-filled balloon. Other polyps such as ''[[Tubularia]]'' use columns of water-filled cells for support. [[Sea pen]]s stiffen the mesoglea with [[calcium carbonate]] [[wikt:spicule|spicule]]s and tough fibrous [[protein]]s, rather like [[sponge]]s.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\nIn some colonial polyps, a [[chitin]]ous [[periderm]] gives support and some protection to the connecting sections and to the lower parts of individual polyps. [[Scleractinia|Stony coral]]s secrete massive calcium carbonate [[exoskeleton]]s. A few polyps collect materials such as sand grains and shell fragments, which they attach to their outsides. Some colonial sea anemones stiffen the mesoglea with [[sediment]] particles.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n===Main cell layers===\nCnidaria are [[diploblastic]] animals; in other words, they have two main cell layers, while more complex animals are [[triploblast]]s having three main layers. The two main cell layers of cnidarians form [[epithelia]] that are mostly one cell thick, and are attached to a fibrous [[basement membrane]], which they [[secrete]]. They also secrete the jelly-like [[mesoglea]] that separates the layers. The layer that faces outwards, known as the [[ectoderm]] (\"outside skin\"), generally contains the following types of cells:<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n*Epitheliomuscular cells whose bodies form part of the epithelium but whose bases extend to form [[muscle]] fibers in parallel rows.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004MuscleTissue\">{{cite book| author1=Ruppert, E.E.| author2=Fox, R.S.| author3=Barnes, R.D.| last-author-amp=yes| title=Invertebrate Zoology| publisher=Brooks / Cole| edition=7| isbn=978-0-03-025982-1| year=2004| pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780030259821/page/103 103\u2013104]| chapter=Introduction to Metazoa| url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780030259821/page/103}}</ref> The fibers of the outward-facing cell layer generally run at right angles to the fibers of the inward-facing one.

Spirocysts do not have cilia.\n*A tough capsule, the [[cnida]], which houses the thread, its payload and a mixture of chemicals that may include venom or [[adhesive]]s or both. (\"cnida\" is derived from the Greek word \u03ba\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b7, which means \"nettle\"<ref>{{Cite book\n| title=Shorter Oxford English Dictionary| contribution=Cnida\n|author1=Trumble, W. |author2=Brown, L.\n| publisher=Oxford University Press| year=2002\n}}</ref>)\n*A tube-like extension of the wall of the cnida that points into the cnida, like the finger of a rubber glove pushed inwards. When a cnidocyte fires, the finger pops out. If the cell is a venomous nematocyte, the \"finger\"'s tip reveals a set of barbs that anchor it in the prey.\n*The thread, which is an extension of the \"finger\" and coils round it until the cnidocyte fires. The thread is usually hollow and delivers chemicals from the cnida to the target.\n*An [[Operculum (animal)|operculum]] (lid) over the end of the cnida. The lid may be a single hinged flap or three flaps arranged like slices of pie.\n*The cell body, which produces all the other parts.\n\nIt is difficult to study the firing mechanisms of cnidocytes as these structures are small but very complex. At least four hypotheses have been proposed:<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n*Rapid contraction of fibers round the cnida may increase its internal pressure.\n*The thread may be like a coiled spring that extends rapidly when released.\n*In the case of ''[[Chironex]]'' (the \"sea wasp\"), chemical changes in the cnida's contents may cause them to expand rapidly by [[polymerization]].\n*Chemical changes in the liquid in the cnida make it a much more [[concentration|concentrated]] solution, so that [[osmotic pressure]] forces water in very rapidly to dilute it. This mechanism has been observed in nematocysts of the class [[Hydrozoa]], sometimes producing pressures as high as 140 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmospheres]], similar to that of [[Scuba set|scuba]] air tanks, and fully extending the thread in as little as 2&nbsp;milliseconds (0.002&nbsp;second).<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\nCnidocytes can only fire once, and about 25% of a hydra's nematocysts are lost from its tentacles when capturing a [[brine shrimp]]. Used cnidocytes have to be replaced, which takes about 48&nbsp;hours. To minimise wasteful firing, two types of stimulus are generally required to trigger cnidocytes: nearby [[sensory neuron|sensory]] cells detect chemicals in the water, and their cilia respond to contact. This combination prevents them from firing at distant or non-living objects. Groups of cnidocytes are usually connected by nerves and, if one fires, the rest of the group requires a weaker minimum stimulus than the cells that fire first.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /><ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n===Locomotion===\n[[File:Chrysaora quinquecirrha-Sea nettle (jellyfish).ogg|thumb| right| 200px| A swimming sea nettle known as the purple-striped jelly (''[[Chrysaora colorata]]'')]]\nMedusae swim by a form of jet propulsion: muscles, especially inside the rim of the bell, squeeze water out of the cavity inside the bell, and the springiness of the mesoglea powers the recovery stroke. Since the tissue layers are very thin, they provide too little power to swim against currents and just enough to control movement within currents.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n[[hydra (genus)|Hydra]]s and some [[sea anemone]]s can move slowly over rocks and sea or stream beds by various means: creeping like snails, crawling like [[Geometer moth|inchworm]]s, or by [[Cartwheel (gymnastics)|somersault]]ing. A few can swim clumsily by waggling their bases.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n===Nervous system and senses===\nCnidarians are generally thought to have no brains or even central nervous systems. However, they do have integrative areas of neural tissue that could be considered some form of centralization. Most of their bodies are innervated by decentralized nerve nets that control their swimming musculature and connect with sensory structures, though each clade has slightly different structures.<ref name=SatterlieCentral>{{Cite journal|last=Satterlie|first=Richard A.|date=15 April 2011|title=Do jellyfish have central nervous systems?|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|language=en|volume=214|issue=8|pages=1215\u20131223|doi=10.1242/jeb.043687|issn=0022-0949|pmid=21430196}}</ref> These sensory structures, usually called rhopalia, can generate signals in response to various types of stimuli such as light, pressure, and much more. Medusa usually have several of them around the margin of the bell that work together to control the motor nerve net, that directly innervates the swimming muscles. Most Cnidarians also have a parallel system. In scyphozoans, this takes the form of a diffuse nerve net, which has modulatory effects on the nervous system.<ref name=SatterlieControl>{{Cite journal|last=Satterlie|first=Richard A|date=2002-10-01|title=Neuronal control of swimming in jellyfish: a comparative story|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|volume=80|issue=10|pages=1654\u20131669|doi=10.1139/z02-132|issn=0008-4301|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/be8fbb5d133e10d7e2bdd85989085b73bbee2c7e}}</ref> As well as forming the \"signal cables\" between sensory neurons and motoneurons, intermediate neurons in the nerve net can also form ganglia that act as local coordination centers. Communication between nerve cells can occur by chemical synapses or gap junctions in hydrozoans, though gap junctions are not present in all groups. Cnidarians have many of the same neurotransmitters as many animals, including chemicals such as glutamate, GABA, and acetylcholine.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kass-Simon|first=G.|last2=Pierobon|first2=Paola|date=1 January 2007|title=Cnidarian chemical neurotransmission, an updated overview|journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A: Molecular & Integrative Physiology|volume=146|issue=1|pages=9\u201325|doi=10.1016/j.cbpa.2006.09.008|pmid=17101286}}</ref>\n\nThis structure ensures that the musculature is excited rapidly and simultaneously, and can be directly stimulated from any point on the body, and it also is better able to recover after injury.<ref name=SatterlieCentral/><ref name=SatterlieControl />\n\nMedusae and complex swimming colonies such as [[siphonophore]]s and [[chondrophore]]s sense tilt and acceleration by means of [[statocyst]]s, chambers lined with hairs which detect the movements of internal mineral grains called statoliths.

Most species have [[ocelli]] (\"simple eyes\"), which can detect sources of light.

Most obtain the majority of their food from predation but some, including the [[coral]]s ''[[Hetroxenia]]'' and ''[[Leptogorgia]]'', depend almost completely on their [[endosymbiont]]s and on absorbing dissolved nutrients.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /> Cnidaria give their symbiotic algae [[carbon dioxide]], some nutrients, a place in the sun and protection against predators.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\nPredatory species use their [[cnidocyte]]s to poison or entangle prey, and those with venomous [[nematocyst]]s may start digestion by injecting digestive [[enzyme]]s. The \"smell\" of fluids from wounded prey makes the tentacles fold inwards and wipe the prey off into the mouth. In medusae the tentacles round the edge of the bell are often short and most of the prey capture is done by \"oral arms\", which are extensions of the edge of the mouth and are often frilled and sometimes branched to increase their surface area. Medusae often trap prey or suspended food particles by swimming upwards, spreading their tentacles and oral arms and then sinking. In species for which suspended food particles are important, the tentacles and oral arms often have rows of [[cilia]] whose beating creates currents that flow towards the mouth, and some produce nets of [[mucus]] to trap particles.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /> Their digestion is both intra and extracellular.\n\nOnce the food is in the digestive cavity, [[gland]] cells in the [[gastrodermis|gastroderm]] release enzymes that reduce the prey to slurry, usually within a few hours. This circulates through the digestive cavity and, in colonial cnidarians, through the connecting tunnels, so that gastroderm cells can absorb the nutrients. Absorption may take a few hours, and digestion within the cells may take a few days. The circulation of nutrients is driven by water currents produced by cilia in the gastroderm or by muscular movements or both, so that nutrients reach all parts of the digestive cavity.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" /> Nutrients reach the outer cell layer by [[diffusion]] or, for animals or zooids such as medusae which have thick [[mesoglea]]s, are transported by mobile cells in the mesoglea.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n\nIndigestible remains of prey are expelled through the mouth. The main waste product of cells' internal processes is [[ammonia]], which is removed by the external and internal water currents.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n===Respiration===\nThere are no respiratory organs, and both cell layers absorb oxygen from and expel [[carbon dioxide]] into the surrounding water. When the water in the digestive cavity becomes stale it must be replaced, and nutrients that have not been absorbed will be expelled with it. Some [[Anthozoa]] have ciliated grooves on their tentacles, allowing them to pump water out of and into the digestive cavity without opening the mouth. This improves respiration after feeding and allows these animals, which use the cavity as a [[hydrostatic skeleton]], to control the water pressure in the cavity without expelling undigested food.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n\nCnidaria that carry [[photosynthetic]] [[symbiont]]s may have the opposite problem, an excess of oxygen, which may prove [[Oxygen toxicity|toxic]]. The animals produce large quantities of [[antioxidant]]s to neutralize the excess oxygen.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n\n===Regeneration===\nAll cnidarians can [[regeneration (biology)|regenerate]], allowing them to recover from injury and to reproduce [[asexual reproduction|asexually]]. Medusae have limited ability to regenerate, but polyps can do so from small pieces or even collections of separated cells. This enables corals to recover even after apparently being destroyed by predators.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n\n==Reproduction==\n{{Annotated image| float=right| caption=Life cycle of a [[jellyfish]]:<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /><ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" /><br>'''1\u20133''' Larva searches for site<br>'''4\u20138''' Polyp grows<br>'''9\u201311''' Polyp [[strobilation|strobilates]]<br>'''12\u201314''' Medusa grows| image=Schleiden-meduse-2.jpg| width=193| image-width=200| height=292| annot-font-weight=bold| annot-background-color=yellow| annot-font-size=10\n| annotations=\n{{Annotation|100|231|&nbsp;1&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|60|232|&nbsp;2&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|9|232|&nbsp;3&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|4|260|&nbsp;4&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|40|260|&nbsp;5&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|78|260|&nbsp;6&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|120|260|&nbsp;7&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|151|216|&nbsp;8&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|166|147|&nbsp;9&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|104|159|&nbsp;10&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|50|162|&nbsp;11&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|29|38|&nbsp;12&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|87|60|&nbsp;13&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|161|62|&nbsp;14&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n}}\n\n===Sexual===\n\nCnidarian [[sexual reproduction]] often involves a complex life cycle with both [[polyp (zoology)|polyp]] and [[Medusa (biology)|medusa]] stages. For example, in [[Scyphozoa]] (jellyfish) and [[Cubozoa]] (box jellies) a [[larva]] swims until it finds a good site, and then becomes a polyp. This grows normally but then absorbs its tentacles and splits horizontally into a series of disks that become juvenile medusae, a process called [[strobilation]]. The juveniles swim off and slowly grow to maturity, while the polyp re-grows and may continue strobilating periodically. The adults have [[gonad]]s in the [[gastrodermis|gastroderm]], and these release [[ovum|ova]] and [[sperm]] into the water in the breeding season.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /><ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\nThis phenomenon of succession of differently organized generations (one asexually reproducing, sessile polyp, followed by a [[free-swimming]] medusa or a sessile polyp that reproduces sexually)<ref>Vernon A. Harris (1990). \"Hydroids\". ''Sessile animals of the sea shore''.

[[Hydrozoa]] have a variety of life cycles. Some have no polyp stages and some (e.g. ''[[hydra (genus)|hydra]]'') have no medusae. In some species, the medusae remain attached to the polyp and are responsible for sexual reproduction; in extreme cases these reproductive zooids may not look much like medusae. Meanwhile, life cycle reversal, in which polyps are formed directly from medusae without the involvement of sexual reproduction process, was observed in both Hydrozoa (''Turritopsis dohrnii''<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.icm.csic.es/scimar/pdf/56/sm56n2137.pdf|title = Bi-directional conversion in Turritopsis nutricula (Hydrozoa)|last = Bavestrello|date = 1992|journal = Scientia Marina|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 2015-12-31|display-authors=etal}}</ref> and ''Laodicea undulata''<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Evidence of reverse development in Leptomedusae (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa): the case of Laodicea undulata (Forbes and Goodsir 1851)|last = De Vito|date = 2006|journal = Marine Biology|doi = 10.1007/s00227-005-0182-3|pmid = |display-authors=etal|volume=149|issue = 2|pages=339\u2013346}}</ref>) and Scyphozoa (''Aurelia'' sp.1<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Life Cycle Reversal in Aurelia sp.1 (Cnidaria, Scyphozoa)|last = He|date = 21 December 2015|journal = PLOS One|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0145314|pmid = 26690755|display-authors=etal|pmc=4687044|volume=10|issue = 12|pages=e0145314|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1045314H}}</ref>). [[Anthozoa]] have no medusa stage at all and the polyps are responsible for sexual reproduction.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n\nSpawning is generally driven by environmental factors such as changes in the water temperature, and their release is triggered by lighting conditions such as sunrise, sunset or the [[Lunar phase|phase of the moon]]. Many species of Cnidaria may spawn simultaneously in the same location, so that there are too many ova and sperm for predators to eat more than a tiny percentage&nbsp;\u2014 one famous example is the [[Great Barrier Reef]], where at least 110 [[coral]]s and a few non-cnidarian [[invertebrate]]s produce enough gametes to turn the water cloudy. These mass spawnings may produce [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]], some of which can settle and form polyps, but it is not known how long these can survive. In some species the ova release chemicals that attract sperm of the same species.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n\nThe fertilized eggs develop into larvae by dividing until there are enough cells to form a hollow sphere ([[blastula]]) and then a depression forms at one end ([[gastrulation]]) and eventually becomes the digestive cavity. However, in cnidarians the depression forms at the end further from the yolk (at the [[animal pole]]), while in [[bilaterian]]s it forms at the other end ([[vegetal pole]]).<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" /> The larvae, called [[planula]]e, swim or crawl by means of [[cilia]].<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /> They are cigar-shaped but slightly broader at the \"front\" end, which is the aboral, vegetal-pole end and eventually attaches to a substrate if the species has a polyp stage.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\nAnthozoan larvae either have large [[yolk]]s or are capable of feeding on [[plankton]], and some already have [[endosymbiotic]] [[algae]] that help to feed them. Since the parents are immobile, these feeding capabilities extend the larvae's range and avoid overcrowding of sites. Scyphozoan and hydrozoan larvae have little yolk and most lack endosymbiotic algae, and therefore have to settle quickly and [[metamorphose]] into polyps. Instead, these species rely on their medusae to extend their ranges.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n===Asexual===\nAll known cnidaria can reproduce [[asexual reproduction|asexually]] by various means, in addition to regenerating after being fragmented. [[Hydrozoa]]n polyps only bud, while the medusae of some hydrozoans can divide down the middle. [[Scyphozoa]]n polyps can both bud and split down the middle. In addition to both of these methods, [[Anthozoa]] can split horizontally just above the base. Asexual reproduction makes the daughter cnidarian a clone of the adult.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /><ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n==Classification==\nCnidarians were for a long time grouped with [[Ctenophore]]s in the phylum [[Coelenterata]], but increasing awareness of their differences caused them to be placed in separate phyla. Modern cnidarians are generally classified into four main [[class (biology)|classes]]:<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /> sessile [[Anthozoa]] ([[sea anemone]]s, [[coral]]s, [[sea pen]]s); swimming [[Scyphozoa]] (jellyfish) and [[Cubozoa]] (box jellies); and [[Hydrozoa]], a diverse group that includes all the freshwater cnidarians as well as many marine forms, and has both sessile members such as ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'' and colonial swimmers such as the [[Portuguese Man o' War]].

In 1881, it was proposed that Ctenophora and Bilateria were more closely related to each other, since they shared features that Cnidaria lack, for example muscles in the middle layer ([[mesoglea]] in Ctenophora, [[mesoderm]] in Bilateria). However more recent analyses indicate that these similarities are rather vague, and the current view, based on molecular phylogenetics, is that Cnidaria and Bilateria are more closely related to each other than either is to Ctenophora. This grouping of Cnidaria and Bilateria has been labelled \"[[Planulozoa]]\" because it suggests that the earliest Bilateria were similar to the [[planula]] larvae of Cnidaria.<ref name=\"Collins2002PhylogenyOfMedusozoa\">{{cite journal| author=Collins, A.G.| date=May 2002| title=Phylogeny of Medusozoa and the Evolution of Cnidarian Life Cycles| journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology| volume=15| issue=3| pages=418\u2013432| doi=10.1046/j.1420-9101.2002.00403.x| url=http://cima.uprm.edu/~n_schizas/CMOB_8676/Collins2002.pdf| accessdate=2008-11-27| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060922080742/http://cima.uprm.edu/~n_schizas/CMOB_8676/Collins2002.pdf| archive-date=2006-09-22| url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"WallbergEtAl2004PhylogeneticPositionOfCtenophora\">{{cite journal\n| author=Wallberg, A. | author2=Thollesson, M. | author3=Farris, J.S. | author4=Jondelius, U. |last-author-amp=yes\n| title=The phylogenetic position of the comb jellies (Ctenophora) and the importance of taxonomic sampling\n| journal=Cladistics| volume=20| year=2004| pages=558\u2013578\n| doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.2004.00041.x\n| issue=6\n}}</ref>\n\nWithin the Cnidaria, the Anthozoa (sea anemones and corals) are regarded as the sister-group of the rest, which suggests that the earliest cnidarians were [[sessility (zoology)|sessile]] polyps with no medusa stage. However, it is unclear how the other groups acquired the medusa stage, since [[Hydrozoa]] form medusae by budding from the side of the polyp while the other Medusozoa do so by splitting them off from the tip of the polyp. The traditional grouping of [[Scyphozoa]] included the [[Staurozoa]], but morphology and molecular phylogenetics indicate that Staurozoa are more closely related to [[Cubozoa]] (box jellies) than to other \"Scyphozoa\". Similarities in the double body walls of Staurozoa and the extinct [[Conulariida]] suggest that they are closely related. The position of Anthozoa nearest the beginning of the cnidarian family tree also implies that Anthozoa are the cnidarians most closely related to Bilateria, and this is supported by the fact that Anthozoa and Bilateria share some genes that determine the main [[Axis of symmetry|axes]] of the body.<ref name=\"Collins2002PhylogenyOfMedusozoa\" /><ref>{{cite journal\n|author1=Marques, A.C. |author2=Collins, A.G.| year=2004\n| title=Cladistic analysis of Medusozoa and cnidarian evolution\n| journal=Invertebrate Biology| volume=123| issue=1| pages=23\u201342| doi=10.1111/j.1744-7410.2004.tb00139.x\n| url=http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=sourceget&id=38492| accessdate=2008-11-27\n}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in 2005 Katja Seipel and Volker Schmid suggested that cnidarians and ctenophores are simplified descendants of [[triploblastic]] animals, since ctenophores and the medusa stage of some cnidarians have [[striated muscle]], which in bilaterians arises from the [[mesoderm]].

Since these animals have no heads, their ends are described as \"oral\" (nearest the mouth) and \"aboral\" (furthest from the mouth). \n\nMost have fringes of tentacles equipped with [[Cnidocyte|cnidocytes]] around their edges, and medusae generally have an inner ring of tentacles around the mouth. Some hydroids may consist of colonies of [[zooid]]s that serve different purposes, such as defense, reproduction and catching prey. The [[mesoglea]] of polyps is usually thin and often soft, but that of medusae is usually thick and springy, so that it returns to its original shape after muscles around the edge have contracted to squeeze water out, enabling medusae to swim by a sort of [[jet propulsion]].<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n===Skeletons===\nIn medusae the only supporting structure is the [[mesoglea]]. ''[[hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'' and most [[sea anemone]]s close their mouths when they are not feeding, and the water in the digestive cavity then acts as a [[hydrostatic skeleton]], rather like a water-filled balloon. Other polyps such as ''[[Tubularia]]'' use columns of water-filled cells for support. [[Sea pen]]s stiffen the mesoglea with [[calcium carbonate]] [[wikt:spicule|spicule]]s and tough fibrous [[protein]]s, rather like [[sponge]]s.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\nIn some colonial polyps, a [[chitin]]ous [[periderm]] gives support and some protection to the connecting sections and to the lower parts of individual polyps. [[Scleractinia|Stony coral]]s secrete massive calcium carbonate [[exoskeleton]]s. A few polyps collect materials such as sand grains and shell fragments, which they attach to their outsides. Some colonial sea anemones stiffen the mesoglea with [[sediment]] particles.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n===Main cell layers===\nCnidaria are [[diploblastic]] animals; in other words, they have two main cell layers, while more complex animals are [[triploblast]]s having three main layers. The two main cell layers of cnidarians form [[epithelia]] that are mostly one cell thick, and are attached to a fibrous [[basement membrane]], which they [[secrete]]. They also secrete the jelly-like [[mesoglea]] that separates the layers. The layer that faces outwards, known as the [[ectoderm]] (\"outside skin\"), generally contains the following types of cells:<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n*Epitheliomuscular cells whose bodies form part of the epithelium but whose bases extend to form [[muscle]] fibers in parallel rows.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004MuscleTissue\">{{cite book| author1=Ruppert, E.E.| author2=Fox, R.S.| author3=Barnes, R.D.| last-author-amp=yes| title=Invertebrate Zoology| publisher=Brooks / Cole| edition=7| isbn=978-0-03-025982-1| year=2004| pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780030259821/page/103 103\u2013104]| chapter=Introduction to Metazoa| url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780030259821/page/103}}</ref> The fibers of the outward-facing cell layer generally run at right angles to the fibers of the inward-facing one.

Spirocysts do not have cilia.\n*A tough capsule, the [[cnida]], which houses the thread, its payload and a mixture of chemicals that may include venom or [[adhesive]]s or both. (\"cnida\" is derived from the Greek word \u03ba\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b7, which means \"nettle\"<ref>{{Cite book\n| title=Shorter Oxford English Dictionary| contribution=Cnida\n|author1=Trumble, W. |author2=Brown, L.\n| publisher=Oxford University Press| year=2002\n}}</ref>)\n*A tube-like extension of the wall of the cnida that points into the cnida, like the finger of a rubber glove pushed inwards. When a cnidocyte fires, the finger pops out. If the cell is a venomous nematocyte, the \"finger\"'s tip reveals a set of barbs that anchor it in the prey.\n*The thread, which is an extension of the \"finger\" and coils round it until the cnidocyte fires. The thread is usually hollow and delivers chemicals from the cnida to the target.\n*An [[Operculum (animal)|operculum]] (lid) over the end of the cnida. The lid may be a single hinged flap or three flaps arranged like slices of pie.\n*The cell body, which produces all the other parts.\n\nIt is difficult to study the firing mechanisms of cnidocytes as these structures are small but very complex. At least four hypotheses have been proposed:<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n*Rapid contraction of fibers round the cnida may increase its internal pressure.\n*The thread may be like a coiled spring that extends rapidly when released.\n*In the case of ''[[Chironex]]'' (the \"sea wasp\"), chemical changes in the cnida's contents may cause them to expand rapidly by [[polymerization]].\n*Chemical changes in the liquid in the cnida make it a much more [[concentration|concentrated]] solution, so that [[osmotic pressure]] forces water in very rapidly to dilute it. This mechanism has been observed in nematocysts of the class [[Hydrozoa]], sometimes producing pressures as high as 140 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmospheres]], similar to that of [[Scuba set|scuba]] air tanks, and fully extending the thread in as little as 2&nbsp;milliseconds (0.002&nbsp;second).<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\nCnidocytes can only fire once, and about 25% of a hydra's nematocysts are lost from its tentacles when capturing a [[brine shrimp]]. Used cnidocytes have to be replaced, which takes about 48&nbsp;hours. To minimise wasteful firing, two types of stimulus are generally required to trigger cnidocytes: nearby [[sensory neuron|sensory]] cells detect chemicals in the water, and their cilia respond to contact. This combination prevents them from firing at distant or non-living objects. Groups of cnidocytes are usually connected by nerves and, if one fires, the rest of the group requires a weaker minimum stimulus than the cells that fire first.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /><ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n===Locomotion===\n[[File:Chrysaora quinquecirrha-Sea nettle (jellyfish).ogg|thumb| right| 200px| A swimming sea nettle known as the purple-striped jelly (''[[Chrysaora colorata]]'')]]\nMedusae swim by a form of jet propulsion: muscles, especially inside the rim of the bell, squeeze water out of the cavity inside the bell, and the springiness of the mesoglea powers the recovery stroke.

A few can swim clumsily by waggling their bases.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n===Nervous system and senses===\nCnidarians are generally thought to have no brains or even central nervous systems. However, they do have integrative areas of neural tissue that could be considered some form of centralization.

Most obtain the majority of their food from predation but some, including the [[coral]]s ''[[Hetroxenia]]'' and ''[[Leptogorgia]]'', depend almost completely on their [[endosymbiont]]s and on absorbing dissolved nutrients.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /> Cnidaria give their symbiotic algae [[carbon dioxide]], some nutrients, a place in the sun and protection against predators.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\nPredatory species use their [[cnidocyte]]s to poison or entangle prey, and those with venomous [[nematocyst]]s may start digestion by injecting digestive [[enzyme]]s. The \"smell\" of fluids from wounded prey makes the tentacles fold inwards and wipe the prey off into the mouth. In medusae the tentacles round the edge of the bell are often short and most of the prey capture is done by \"oral arms\", which are extensions of the edge of the mouth and are often frilled and sometimes branched to increase their surface area. Medusae often trap prey or suspended food particles by swimming upwards, spreading their tentacles and oral arms and then sinking. In species for which suspended food particles are important, the tentacles and oral arms often have rows of [[cilia]] whose beating creates currents that flow towards the mouth, and some produce nets of [[mucus]] to trap particles.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /> Their digestion is both intra and extracellular.\n\nOnce the food is in the digestive cavity, [[gland]] cells in the [[gastrodermis|gastroderm]] release enzymes that reduce the prey to slurry, usually within a few hours. This circulates through the digestive cavity and, in colonial cnidarians, through the connecting tunnels, so that gastroderm cells can absorb the nutrients. Absorption may take a few hours, and digestion within the cells may take a few days. The circulation of nutrients is driven by water currents produced by cilia in the gastroderm or by muscular movements or both, so that nutrients reach all parts of the digestive cavity.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" /> Nutrients reach the outer cell layer by [[diffusion]] or, for animals or zooids such as medusae which have thick [[mesoglea]]s, are transported by mobile cells in the mesoglea.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n\nIndigestible remains of prey are expelled through the mouth. The main waste product of cells' internal processes is [[ammonia]], which is removed by the external and internal water currents.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n===Respiration===\nThere are no respiratory organs, and both cell layers absorb oxygen from and expel [[carbon dioxide]] into the surrounding water. When the water in the digestive cavity becomes stale it must be replaced, and nutrients that have not been absorbed will be expelled with it. Some [[Anthozoa]] have ciliated grooves on their tentacles, allowing them to pump water out of and into the digestive cavity without opening the mouth. This improves respiration after feeding and allows these animals, which use the cavity as a [[hydrostatic skeleton]], to control the water pressure in the cavity without expelling undigested food.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n\nCnidaria that carry [[photosynthetic]] [[symbiont]]s may have the opposite problem, an excess of oxygen, which may prove [[Oxygen toxicity|toxic]]. The animals produce large quantities of [[antioxidant]]s to neutralize the excess oxygen.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n\n===Regeneration===\nAll cnidarians can [[regeneration (biology)|regenerate]], allowing them to recover from injury and to reproduce [[asexual reproduction|asexually]]. Medusae have limited ability to regenerate, but polyps can do so from small pieces or even collections of separated cells. This enables corals to recover even after apparently being destroyed by predators.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n\n==Reproduction==\n{{Annotated image| float=right| caption=Life cycle of a [[jellyfish]]:<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /><ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" /><br>'''1\u20133''' Larva searches for site<br>'''4\u20138''' Polyp grows<br>'''9\u201311''' Polyp [[strobilation|strobilates]]<br>'''12\u201314''' Medusa grows| image=Schleiden-meduse-2.jpg| width=193| image-width=200| height=292| annot-font-weight=bold| annot-background-color=yellow| annot-font-size=10\n| annotations=\n{{Annotation|100|231|&nbsp;1&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|60|232|&nbsp;2&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|9|232|&nbsp;3&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|4|260|&nbsp;4&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|40|260|&nbsp;5&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|78|260|&nbsp;6&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|120|260|&nbsp;7&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|151|216|&nbsp;8&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|166|147|&nbsp;9&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|104|159|&nbsp;10&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|50|162|&nbsp;11&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|29|38|&nbsp;12&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|87|60|&nbsp;13&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|161|62|&nbsp;14&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n}}\n\n===Sexual===\n\nCnidarian [[sexual reproduction]] often involves a complex life cycle with both [[polyp (zoology)|polyp]] and [[Medusa (biology)|medusa]] stages. For example, in [[Scyphozoa]] (jellyfish) and [[Cubozoa]] (box jellies) a [[larva]] swims until it finds a good site, and then becomes a polyp. This grows normally but then absorbs its tentacles and splits horizontally into a series of disks that become juvenile medusae, a process called [[strobilation]]. The juveniles swim off and slowly grow to maturity, while the polyp re-grows and may continue strobilating periodically. The adults have [[gonad]]s in the [[gastrodermis|gastroderm]], and these release [[ovum|ova]] and [[sperm]] into the water in the breeding season.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /><ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\nThis phenomenon of succession of differently organized generations (one asexually reproducing, sessile polyp, followed by a [[free-swimming]] medusa or a sessile polyp that reproduces sexually)<ref>Vernon A. Harris (1990). \"Hydroids\". ''Sessile animals of the sea shore''. Springer. p. 223, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DbaBQm_ZQkIC&lpg=PA223&dq=alternation%20of%20generations%20cnidaria&hl=pt-BR&pg=PA223#v=onepage&q=alternation%20of%20generation%20&f=false].</ref> is sometimes called \"alternation of asexual and sexual phases\" or \"metagenesis\", but should not be confused with the [[alternation of generations]] as found in plants.\n\nShortened forms of this life cycle are common, for example some oceanic scyphozoans omit the polyp stage completely, and cubozoan polyps produce only one medusa. [[Hydrozoa]] have a variety of life cycles. Some have no polyp stages and some (e.g. ''[[hydra (genus)|hydra]]'') have no medusae. In some species, the medusae remain attached to the polyp and are responsible for sexual reproduction; in extreme cases these reproductive zooids may not look much like medusae. Meanwhile, life cycle reversal, in which polyps are formed directly from medusae without the involvement of sexual reproduction process, was observed in both Hydrozoa (''Turritopsis dohrnii''<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.icm.csic.es/scimar/pdf/56/sm56n2137.pdf|title = Bi-directional conversion in Turritopsis nutricula (Hydrozoa)|last = Bavestrello|date = 1992|journal = Scientia Marina|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 2015-12-31|display-authors=etal}}</ref> and ''Laodicea undulata''<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Evidence of reverse development in Leptomedusae (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa): the case of Laodicea undulata (Forbes and Goodsir 1851)|last = De Vito|date = 2006|journal = Marine Biology|doi = 10.1007/s00227-005-0182-3|pmid = |display-authors=etal|volume=149|issue = 2|pages=339\u2013346}}</ref>) and Scyphozoa (''Aurelia'' sp.1<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Life Cycle Reversal in Aurelia sp.1 (Cnidaria, Scyphozoa)|last = He|date = 21 December 2015|journal = PLOS One|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0145314|pmid = 26690755|display-authors=etal|pmc=4687044|volume=10|issue = 12|pages=e0145314|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1045314H}}</ref>). [[Anthozoa]] have no medusa stage at all and the polyps are responsible for sexual reproduction.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n\nSpawning is generally driven by environmental factors such as changes in the water temperature, and their release is triggered by lighting conditions such as sunrise, sunset or the [[Lunar phase|phase of the moon]]. Many species of Cnidaria may spawn simultaneously in the same location, so that there are too many ova and sperm for predators to eat more than a tiny percentage&nbsp;\u2014 one famous example is the [[Great Barrier Reef]], where at least 110 [[coral]]s and a few non-cnidarian [[invertebrate]]s produce enough gametes to turn the water cloudy. These mass spawnings may produce [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]], some of which can settle and form polyps, but it is not known how long these can survive. In some species the ova release chemicals that attract sperm of the same species.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n\nThe fertilized eggs develop into larvae by dividing until there are enough cells to form a hollow sphere ([[blastula]]) and then a depression forms at one end ([[gastrulation]]) and eventually becomes the digestive cavity. However, in cnidarians the depression forms at the end further from the yolk (at the [[animal pole]]), while in [[bilaterian]]s it forms at the other end ([[vegetal pole]]).<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" /> The larvae, called [[planula]]e, swim or crawl by means of [[cilia]].<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /> They are cigar-shaped but slightly broader at the \"front\" end, which is the aboral, vegetal-pole end and eventually attaches to a substrate if the species has a polyp stage.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\nAnthozoan larvae either have large [[yolk]]s or are capable of feeding on [[plankton]], and some already have [[endosymbiotic]] [[algae]] that help to feed them. Since the parents are immobile, these feeding capabilities extend the larvae's range and avoid overcrowding of sites. Scyphozoan and hydrozoan larvae have little yolk and most lack endosymbiotic algae, and therefore have to settle quickly and [[metamorphose]] into polyps. Instead, these species rely on their medusae to extend their ranges.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n===Asexual===\nAll known cnidaria can reproduce [[asexual reproduction|asexually]] by various means, in addition to regenerating after being fragmented. [[Hydrozoa]]n polyps only bud, while the medusae of some hydrozoans can divide down the middle. [[Scyphozoa]]n polyps can both bud and split down the middle. In addition to both of these methods, [[Anthozoa]] can split horizontally just above the base. Asexual reproduction makes the daughter cnidarian a clone of the adult.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /><ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n==Classification==\nCnidarians were for a long time grouped with [[Ctenophore]]s in the phylum [[Coelenterata]], but increasing awareness of their differences caused them to be placed in separate phyla. Modern cnidarians are generally classified into four main [[class (biology)|classes]]:<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /> sessile [[Anthozoa]] ([[sea anemone]]s, [[coral]]s, [[sea pen]]s); swimming [[Scyphozoa]] (jellyfish) and [[Cubozoa]] (box jellies); and [[Hydrozoa]], a diverse group that includes all the freshwater cnidarians as well as many marine forms, and has both sessile members such as ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'' and colonial swimmers such as the [[Portuguese Man o' War]]. [[Staurozoa]] have recently been recognised as a [[class (biology)|class]] in their own right rather than a sub-group of Scyphozoa, and the parasitic [[Myxozoa]] and [[Polypodiozoa]] are now recognized as highly derived cnidarians rather than more closely related to the [[bilateria]]ns.<ref name=\"E.

In addition, reefs provide complex and varied habitats that support a wide range of other organisms.<ref name=\"BarnesMann1991AquaticEcology\">{{cite book\n| title=Fundamentals of Aquatic Ecology|author1=Barnes, R.S.K. |author2=Mann, K.H.\n| publisher=Blackwell Publishing| year=1991| isbn=978-0-632-02983-9| pages=217\u2013227\n| url=https://books.google.com/?id=mOZZlzgdTrwC&pg=PA227&dq=%22Coral+Reef%22+productivity| accessdate=2008-11-26\n}}</ref> [[Fringing reef]]s just below low-[[tide]] level also have a mutually beneficial relationship with [[mangrove]] forests at high-tide level and [[seagrass]] meadows in between: the reefs protect the mangroves and seagrass from strong currents and waves that would damage them or [[erosion|erode]] the sediments in which they are rooted, while the mangroves and seagrass protect the coral from large influxes of [[silt]], fresh water and [[pollution|pollutants]].

In 1881, it was proposed that Ctenophora and Bilateria were more closely related to each other, since they shared features that Cnidaria lack, for example muscles in the middle layer ([[mesoglea]] in Ctenophora, [[mesoderm]] in Bilateria). However more recent analyses indicate that these similarities are rather vague, and the current view, based on molecular phylogenetics, is that Cnidaria and Bilateria are more closely related to each other than either is to Ctenophora. This grouping of Cnidaria and Bilateria has been labelled \"[[Planulozoa]]\" because it suggests that the earliest Bilateria were similar to the [[planula]] larvae of Cnidaria.<ref name=\"Collins2002PhylogenyOfMedusozoa\">{{cite journal| author=Collins, A.G.| date=May 2002| title=Phylogeny of Medusozoa and the Evolution of Cnidarian Life Cycles| journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology| volume=15| issue=3| pages=418\u2013432| doi=10.1046/j.1420-9101.2002.00403.x| url=http://cima.uprm.edu/~n_schizas/CMOB_8676/Collins2002.pdf| accessdate=2008-11-27| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060922080742/http://cima.uprm.edu/~n_schizas/CMOB_8676/Collins2002.pdf| archive-date=2006-09-22| url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"WallbergEtAl2004PhylogeneticPositionOfCtenophora\">{{cite journal\n| author=Wallberg, A. | author2=Thollesson, M. | author3=Farris, J.S. | author4=Jondelius, U. |last-author-amp=yes\n| title=The phylogenetic position of the comb jellies (Ctenophora) and the importance of taxonomic sampling\n| journal=Cladistics| volume=20| year=2004| pages=558\u2013578\n| doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.2004.00041.x\n| issue=6\n}}</ref>\n\nWithin the Cnidaria, the Anthozoa (sea anemones and corals) are regarded as the sister-group of the rest, which suggests that the earliest cnidarians were [[sessility (zoology)|sessile]] polyps with no medusa stage. However, it is unclear how the other groups acquired the medusa stage, since [[Hydrozoa]] form medusae by budding from the side of the polyp while the other Medusozoa do so by splitting them off from the tip of the polyp. The traditional grouping of [[Scyphozoa]] included the [[Staurozoa]], but morphology and molecular phylogenetics indicate that Staurozoa are more closely related to [[Cubozoa]] (box jellies) than to other \"Scyphozoa\". Similarities in the double body walls of Staurozoa and the extinct [[Conulariida]] suggest that they are closely related. The position of Anthozoa nearest the beginning of the cnidarian family tree also implies that Anthozoa are the cnidarians most closely related to Bilateria, and this is supported by the fact that Anthozoa and Bilateria share some genes that determine the main [[Axis of symmetry|axes]] of the body.<ref name=\"Collins2002PhylogenyOfMedusozoa\" /><ref>{{cite journal\n|author1=Marques, A.C. |author2=Collins, A.G.| year=2004\n| title=Cladistic analysis of Medusozoa and cnidarian evolution\n| journal=Invertebrate Biology| volume=123| issue=1| pages=23\u201342| doi=10.1111/j.1744-7410.2004.tb00139.x\n| url=http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=sourceget&id=38492| accessdate=2008-11-27\n}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in 2005 Katja Seipel and Volker Schmid suggested that cnidarians and ctenophores are simplified descendants of [[triploblastic]] animals, since ctenophores and the medusa stage of some cnidarians have [[striated muscle]], which in bilaterians arises from the [[mesoderm]].

The field of players is smaller than those of the other major championships because it is an invitational event, held by the Augusta National Golf Club.\n\nThe tournament has a number of traditions. Since [[1949 Masters Tournament|1949]], a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket).<ref>{{cite web |first=Brent |last=Kelley |title=Do Masters Champions Get to Keep the Green Jacket? |url=http://golf.about.com/od/majorchampionships/f/keep_jacket.htm |publisher=About.com}}</ref> The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by [[Ben Hogan]] in [[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in [[1963 Masters Tournament|1963]], legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included [[Fred McLeod]], [[Jock Hutchinson]], [[Gene Sarazen]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Byron Nelson]], [[Arnold Palmer]], [[Jack Nicklaus]], and [[Gary Player]]. Since [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]], a [[Masters Tournament Par-3 contest|semi-social contest]] at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.\n\nNicklaus has the most Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. [[Tiger Woods]] has won five. Palmer has won four. Five have won three titles at Augusta: [[Jimmy Demaret]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Gary Player]], [[Nick Faldo]], and [[Phil Mickelson]]. Player, from [[South Africa]], was the first non-American player to win the tournament, in [[1961 Masters Tournament|1961]]; the second was [[Seve Ballesteros]] of [[Spain]], the champion in [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]] and [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]].\n\nThe Augusta National course first opened {{Years or months ago|1933}} in 1933 and has been modified many times by different architects. Among the changes: greens have been reshaped and, on occasion, entirely re-designed, bunkers have been added, water hazards have been extended, new tee boxes have been built, hundreds of trees have been planted, and several mounds have been installed.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\">{{cite book |title=The Making of the Masters: Clifford Roberts, Augusta National, and Golf's Most Prestigious Tournament |first=David |last=Owen |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-684-85729-9}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:AugustaNationalMastersLogoFlowers.jpg|thumb|<center>Masters logo<br>at the club entrance</center>]]\n\n===Augusta National Golf Club===\n{{main|Augusta National Golf Club}}\nThe idea for Augusta National originated with [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]], who wanted to build a golf course after his retirement from the game.

After making his final putt to win, he broke down sobbing at the hole and was consoled and embraced by his caddie.  In the post-tournament interview, Crenshaw said: \"I had a 15th club in my bag,\" a reference to Penick. (The \"15th club\" reference is based on the golf rule that limits a player to carrying 14 clubs during a round.)  Crenshaw first won at Augusta in 1984.\n\nIn 1997, 21 year-old [[Tiger Woods]] became the youngest champion in Masters history, winning by 12 shots with an 18-under par 270 which broke the 72-hole record that had stood for 32 years.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> In 2001 Woods completed his \"Tiger Slam\" by winning his fourth straight major championship at the Masters by two shots over [[David Duval]]. <ref name=past-results/> He won again the following year, making him only the third player in history (after Nicklaus and Faldo) to win the tournament in consecutive years,<ref name=past-results/> as well as in 2005 when he defeated [[Chris DiMarco]] in a playoff for his first major championship win in almost three years.<ref name=past-results/>\n\nThe club was targeted by [[Martha Burk]], who organized a failed protest at the 2003 Masters to pressure the club into accepting female members.

The green sport coat is the official attire worn by members of Augusta National while on the club grounds; each Masters winner becomes an honorary member of the club. The recipient of the green jacket has it presented to him inside the Butler Cabin soon after the end of the tournament in a televised ceremony, and the presentation is then repeated outside near the 18th green in front of the patrons. Winners keep their jacket for the year after their victory, then return it to the club to wear whenever they are present on the club grounds. [[Sam Snead]] was the first Masters champion to be awarded the green jacket after he took his first Masters title in 1949.\n\nThe green jacket is only allowed to be removed from the Augusta National grounds by the reigning champion, after which it must remain at the club. Exceptions to this rule include Gary Player, who in his joy of winning mistakenly took his jacket home to South Africa after his 1961 victory (although he has always followed the spirit of the rule and has never worn the jacket);<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lukas/070405 |title=The real story behind the green jacket |last=Lukas |first=Paul |work=ESPN |accessdate=November 18, 2008}}</ref> [[Seve Ballesteros]] who, in an interview with [[Peter Alliss]] from his home in Pedre\u00f1a, showed one of his two green jackets in his trophy room; and [[Henry Picard]], whose jacket was removed from the club before the tradition was well established, remained in his closet for a number of years, and is now on display at Canterbury Golf Club in [[Beachwood, Ohio]], where he was the club professional for many years.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1995/04/10/8093250/master-teacher-nearly-forgotten-now-teaching-pro-henry-picard-was-a-big-star-when-he-won-the-1938-masters |title=Master Teacher: Nearly forgotten now, teaching pro Henry Picard was a big star when he won the 1938 Masters |first=Rick |last=Lispey |magazine=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |date=April 10, 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiogolfandtravelguide.com/ohio/golf-news/michael-kernicki-hosts-major-championship-at-canterbury-golf-club.html |title=Michael Kernicki hosts Major Championship at Canterbury Golf Club |publisher=GolfGuide.com |accessdate=April 10, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111083303/http://www.ohiogolfandtravelguide.com/ohio/golf-news/michael-kernicki-hosts-major-championship-at-canterbury-golf-club.html |archivedate=November 11, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nBy tradition, the winner of the previous year's Masters Tournament puts the jacket on the current winner at the end of the tournament.

In 1997, 1979 champion [[Fuzzy Zoeller]] created a media storm when he suggested that Tiger Woods refrain from serving collard greens and fried chicken, dishes commonly associated with Afro-American culture, at the dinner.

Since [[1948 Masters Tournament|1948]], its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April, with several exceptions. It ended on the first Sunday four times ([[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], [[1958 Masters Tournament|1958]], [[1959 Masters Tournament|1959]]) and the [[1979 Masters Tournament|1979]] and [[1984 Masters Tournament|1984]] tournaments ended on April 15, the month's third Sunday.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> The first edition in [[1934 Masters Tournament|1934]] was held in late March and the next ten were in early April, with only the [[1942 Masters Tournament|1942]] event scheduled to end on the second Sunday.  The [[2020 Masters Tournament|2020]] event, postponed by the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, is slated to be held in the autumn, with it being the last major of the year.\n\nSimilar to the other majors, the tournament consists of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three for the first two rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time, such as the second round in 1983, fourth round in 2019, and is expected for all four rounds in 2020. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\" />\n\nOriginally, the Masters was the only tournament to use two-man pairings during the first two rounds. It was also the only event to re-pair based on the leaderboard before Friday's round, as most tournaments only do this on the weekend. This practice ended in the early 2000s, when the Masters switched to the more standard three-man groups and the groups are now kept intact on Friday, with players sharing the same playing partners in both of the first two rounds.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter 36 holes of play, a cut-off score is calculated to reduce the size of the field for the weekend rounds. To \"make the cut\", players must be either in the top 50 places (ties counting), or within 10 strokes of the leader's score. These criteria have applied since [[2013 Masters Tournament|2013]].<ref name=cut>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/masters13/story/_/id/9156060/fall-tour-event-winners-get-masters-spot |title=Masters tweaks qualifications |first=Bob |last=Harig |work=ESPN |date=April 10, 2013 |access-date=April 16, 2013}}</ref> From 1957 to 1960, the top 40 scores (including ties) and those within 10 strokes of the leader made the cut. From 1961 to 2012, it was the top 44 (and ties) or within 10 strokes of the lead.<ref name=cut/> Before [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], there was no 36-hole cut and all of the invitees played four rounds, if desired.<ref name=\"Cut\">{{cite web |url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |title=Cut Information |publisher=www.masters.org |access-date=January 21, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119025225/http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |archivedate=January 19, 2008}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the cut, an additional 36 holes are played over the final two days. Should the fourth round fail to produce a winner, all players tied for the lead enter a [[Sudden death (sport)#Golf|sudden-death]] playoff. Play begins on the 18th hole, followed by the adjacent 10th, repeating until one player remains.

[[Tiger Woods]] has won five. Palmer has won four. Five have won three titles at Augusta: [[Jimmy Demaret]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Gary Player]], [[Nick Faldo]], and [[Phil Mickelson]].

After making his final putt to win, he broke down sobbing at the hole and was consoled and embraced by his caddie.  In the post-tournament interview, Crenshaw said: \"I had a 15th club in my bag,\" a reference to Penick.

The first two rounds will be held at the Champion's Retreat club in [[Evans, Georgia]], with the final two rounds hosted by Augusta National (the final round will take place on the Saturday directly preceding the tournament). Ridley stated that holding such an event at Augusta National would have the \"greatest impact\" on women's golf. Although concerns were raised that the event would conflict with the [[LPGA Tour]]'s [[ANA Inspiration]] (which has invited top amateur players to compete), Ridley stated that he had discussed the event with commissioner [[Mike Whan]], and stated that he agreed on the notion that any move to bolster the prominence of women's golf would be a \"win\" for the LPGA over time.

It invites winners of the most prestigious amateur tournaments in the world. Also, the current [[U.S. Amateur]] champion always plays in the same group as the defending Masters champion for the first two days of the tournament.\n\nAmateurs in the field are welcome to stay in the \"Crow's Nest\" atop the Augusta National clubhouse during the tournament. The Crow's Nest is {{convert|1200|sqft|-1}} with lodging space for five during the competition.\n\n===Opening tee shot===\nSince 1963, the custom in most years has been to start the tournament with an honorary opening tee shot at the first hole, typically by one or more legendary players. The original honorary starters were [[Jock Hutchison]] and [[Fred McLeod]]; this twosome led off every tournament from 1963 until 1973, when poor health prevented Hutchison from swinging a club. McLeod continued on until his death in 1976. Byron Nelson and Gene Sarazen started in 1981, and were then joined by Sam Snead in 1984. This trio continued until 1999 when Sarazen died, while Nelson stopped in 2001. Snead hit his final opening tee shot in 2002, a little over a month before he died.\n\nIn 2007, Arnold Palmer took over as the honorary starter.

Frequently, Masters champions have served cuisine from their home regions prepared by the Masters chef. Notable examples have included [[haggis]], served by [[Scotland|Scotsman]] [[Sandy Lyle]] in 1989,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/course/landmarks.html#dinner |title=Masters Club |publisher=www.masters.org |accessdate=January 25, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109192302/http://www.masters.org/en_US/course/landmarks.html |archivedate=January 9, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and [[bobotie]], a South African dish, served at the behest of 2008 champion [[Trevor Immelman]]. Other examples include German Bernhard Langer's 1986 Wiener schnitzel, Britain's Nick Faldo's fish and chips, Canadian Mike Weir's elk and wild boar, and Vijay Singh's seafood tom kah and chicken panang curry. In 1997, 1979 champion [[Fuzzy Zoeller]] created a media storm when he suggested that Tiger Woods refrain from serving collard greens and fried chicken, dishes commonly associated with Afro-American culture, at the dinner. The 2011 dinner of [[Phil Mickelson]] was a Spanish-themed menu in hopes that [[Seve Ballesteros]] would attend, but he was too sick to attend and died  weeks later.<ref>[http://www.golf.com/tour-news/2017/03/15/masters-champions-dinner-everything-you-need-know Masters Champions Dinner: Everything you need to know]</ref>\n\n===Caddies===\nUntil [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]], all players in the Masters were required to use the services of an Augusta National Club [[caddie]],<ref name=trcdatag>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WFcaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yiQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6177%2C1789683 |newspaper=Times-News |location=Hendersonville, North Carolina |title=Tour caddies at Augusta? |date=November 12, 1982 |page=14}}</ref><ref name=alctrbgd>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3LUSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mvkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6774%2C1068214 |newspaper=Spokane Chronicle |location=Washington |last=Wade |first=Harless |title=Tradition bagged at Masters |date=April 6, 1983 |page=C1}}</ref><ref name=mcadcol>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xMksAAAAIBAJ&sjid=chMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6823%2C3348928 |newspaper=Sunday Star-News |location=Wilmington, North Carolina |last=Anderson |first=Dave |authorlink=Dave Anderson (sportswriter) |title=New Masters caddies collide |date=April 10, 1983 |page=6D}}</ref> who by club tradition was always an African American man.<ref name=\"nyt1990\"/> Indeed, club co-founder Clifford Roberts is reputed to have said, \"As long as I'm alive, golfers will be white, and caddies will be black.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Rick |last=Reilly |authorlink=Rick Reilly |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1997/04/21/225867/strokes-of-genius-overpowering-a-storied-course-and-a-stellar-field-tiger-woods-heralded-a-new-era-in-golf-with-an-awesome-12-shot-victory-in-the-masters |title=Strokes of Genius |date=April 21, 1997 |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |magazine=Sports Illustrated}}</ref> Since 1983\u2014six years after Roberts's death in 1977\u2014players have been allowed the option of bringing their own caddie to the tournament.\n\nThe Masters requires caddies to wear a uniform consisting of a white jumpsuit, a green Masters cap, and white tennis shoes.

Since [[1948 Masters Tournament|1948]], its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April, with several exceptions. It ended on the first Sunday four times ([[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], [[1958 Masters Tournament|1958]], [[1959 Masters Tournament|1959]]) and the [[1979 Masters Tournament|1979]] and [[1984 Masters Tournament|1984]] tournaments ended on April 15, the month's third Sunday.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> The first edition in [[1934 Masters Tournament|1934]] was held in late March and the next ten were in early April, with only the [[1942 Masters Tournament|1942]] event scheduled to end on the second Sunday.  The [[2020 Masters Tournament|2020]] event, postponed by the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, is slated to be held in the autumn, with it being the last major of the year.\n\nSimilar to the other majors, the tournament consists of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three for the first two rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time, such as the second round in 1983, fourth round in 2019, and is expected for all four rounds in 2020. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\" />\n\nOriginally, the Masters was the only tournament to use two-man pairings during the first two rounds. It was also the only event to re-pair based on the leaderboard before Friday's round, as most tournaments only do this on the weekend. This practice ended in the early 2000s, when the Masters switched to the more standard three-man groups and the groups are now kept intact on Friday, with players sharing the same playing partners in both of the first two rounds.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter 36 holes of play, a cut-off score is calculated to reduce the size of the field for the weekend rounds. To \"make the cut\", players must be either in the top 50 places (ties counting), or within 10 strokes of the leader's score. These criteria have applied since [[2013 Masters Tournament|2013]].<ref name=cut>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/masters13/story/_/id/9156060/fall-tour-event-winners-get-masters-spot |title=Masters tweaks qualifications |first=Bob |last=Harig |work=ESPN |date=April 10, 2013 |access-date=April 16, 2013}}</ref> From 1957 to 1960, the top 40 scores (including ties) and those within 10 strokes of the leader made the cut.

presenting an award, known as the Silver Cup, to the lowest-scoring amateur to make the cut. In 1954 they began presenting an amateur silver medal to the low amateur runner-up. There have been six players to win low amateur and then go on to win the Masters as a professional. These players are [[Cary Middlecoff]], [[Jack Nicklaus]], [[Ben Crenshaw]], [[Phil Mickelson]], [[Tiger Woods]] and [[Sergio Garc\u00eda]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable

The institute consists of three service divisions: the academic division - consisting of the colleges and a senior high school (all of which are only medicine and allied health-related courses), its [[Teaching hospital|teaching hospital]] - De La Salle University Medical Center, and a [[Research institute|research facility]] - Angelo King Medical Research Center. Located in [[Dasmari\u00f1as|Dasmari\u00f1as City]], [[Cavite]], it sits only 3 kilometers from [[De La Salle University-Dasmari\u00f1as]] where it is often mistaken as part of due to its proximity but is actually a separate De La Salle campus.\n\n==History==\n\nThe De La Salle Medical and Health Sciences Institute was started by a group of doctors from the College of Medicine of the [[University of the Philippines]] and the [[Philippine General Hospital]] who, in 1976, decided to establish a [[medical school]] to support the need for a well-trained staff for the newly inaugurated Medical Center Manila. Following the national government's policy of dispersing educational facilities outside the [[capital city]] and encouraging the establishment of medical schools in various regions of the country, they decided to establish a medical school in Dasmari\u00f1as City, Cavite. Originally named Emilio Aguinaldo College of Medicine, the school opened in 1979 under the management of the University Physician\u2019s Foundation, Inc. with the Jose P. Rizal National Medical Research Center as its initial [[teaching hospital]]. Then on July 31, 1982, the Foundation inaugurated a 4-storey 180-bed teaching hospital, the University Medical Center.\n\nIn June 1987, ownership and management were acquired by the De La Salle University Inc. In 1992, the college was renamed the De La Salle University College of Medicine and the hospital, the De La Salle University Medical Center. In June 1994, the management of the College of [[Physical Therapy]] which was then part of DLSU-Aguinaldo (now [[De La Salle University - Dasmari\u00f1as|DLSU-D]]) was turned over to the De La Salle University College of Medicine. By June 1995, the complex consisting of the College of Medicine, University Medical Center, College of Physical Therapy, and Research Services was named De La Salle University \u2013 Health Sciences Campus or DLSU-HSC under the ownership and administration of the St. Bro. Miguel Febres Cordero Medical Education Foundation.\n\nIn May 2000, the colleges under the administration of the DLSU-Health Sciences Campus increased with the transfer of the Colleges of [[Radiographer|Medical Radiation Technology]] and [[Nursing]] & [[Midwifery]] (formerly under DLSU-D). Eventually, the institution\u2019s name became De La Salle Health Sciences Institute upon approval of the Board of Trustees in September 2007.\n\nIn January 2018, the term \u201cMedical\u201d was included in the institution's name as granted by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.dlshsi.edu.ph/de-la-salle-medical-health-sciences-institute/history |accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2019, DLSMHSI became an official member of the [[ASEAN University Network]]-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) as confirmed by Banjong Ujjin, the Senior Programme Officer of the AUN Secretariat Team.<ref>{{cite web |title=AUN-QA ASSOCIATE MEMBERS |url=http://aun-qa.org/associate/current#4 |website=ASEAN University Network-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) |accessdate=12 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn October 25, 2019, the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]] (CHED), granted autonomous status to DLSMHSI through the CHED Memorandum Order No. 12, series of 2019. This means that the institution can enjoy a lot of benefits including being allowed to launch new courses/programs in the undergraduate and/or graduate levels including doctoral programs in areas of expertise without securing a permit/authority from CHED; only informing them of the programs to be offered.<ref>{{cite web |title=CMO No. 12, Series of 2019 \u2013 Grant of Autonomous and Deregulated Status to Private HEIs |url=https://ched.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/CMO-No-12-s-2019-Grant-of-Autonomous-and-Deregulated-Status-to-Private-HEIs.pdf |website=Commission on Higher Education |accessdate=26 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n===Programs and Accreditations===\nDLSMHSI offers academic programs through its seven colleges and a special health sciences senior high school.

The institute consists of three service divisions: the academic division - consisting of the colleges and a senior high school (all of which are only medicine and allied health-related courses), its [[Teaching hospital|teaching hospital]] - De La Salle University Medical Center, and a [[Research institute|research facility]] - Angelo King Medical Research Center. Located in [[Dasmari\u00f1as|Dasmari\u00f1as City]], [[Cavite]], it sits only 3 kilometers from [[De La Salle University-Dasmari\u00f1as]] where it is often mistaken as part of due to its proximity but is actually a separate De La Salle campus.\n\n==History==\n\nThe De La Salle Medical and Health Sciences Institute was started by a group of doctors from the College of Medicine of the [[University of the Philippines]] and the [[Philippine General Hospital]] who, in 1976, decided to establish a [[medical school]] to support the need for a well-trained staff for the newly inaugurated Medical Center Manila. Following the national government's policy of dispersing educational facilities outside the [[capital city]] and encouraging the establishment of medical schools in various regions of the country, they decided to establish a medical school in Dasmari\u00f1as City, Cavite. Originally named Emilio Aguinaldo College of Medicine, the school opened in 1979 under the management of the University Physician\u2019s Foundation, Inc. with the Jose P. Rizal National Medical Research Center as its initial [[teaching hospital]]. Then on July 31, 1982, the Foundation inaugurated a 4-storey 180-bed teaching hospital, the University Medical Center.\n\nIn June 1987, ownership and management were acquired by the De La Salle University Inc. In 1992, the college was renamed the De La Salle University College of Medicine and the hospital, the De La Salle University Medical Center. In June 1994, the management of the College of [[Physical Therapy]] which was then part of DLSU-Aguinaldo (now [[De La Salle University - Dasmari\u00f1as|DLSU-D]]) was turned over to the De La Salle University College of Medicine. By June 1995, the complex consisting of the College of Medicine, University Medical Center, College of Physical Therapy, and Research Services was named De La Salle University \u2013 Health Sciences Campus or DLSU-HSC under the ownership and administration of the St. Bro. Miguel Febres Cordero Medical Education Foundation.\n\nIn May 2000, the colleges under the administration of the DLSU-Health Sciences Campus increased with the transfer of the Colleges of [[Radiographer|Medical Radiation Technology]] and [[Nursing]] & [[Midwifery]] (formerly under DLSU-D). Eventually, the institution\u2019s name became De La Salle Health Sciences Institute upon approval of the Board of Trustees in September 2007.\n\nIn January 2018, the term \u201cMedical\u201d was included in the institution's name as granted by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.dlshsi.edu.ph/de-la-salle-medical-health-sciences-institute/history |accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2019, DLSMHSI became an official member of the [[ASEAN University Network]]-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) as confirmed by Banjong Ujjin, the Senior Programme Officer of the AUN Secretariat Team.<ref>{{cite web |title=AUN-QA ASSOCIATE MEMBERS |url=http://aun-qa.org/associate/current#4 |website=ASEAN University Network-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) |accessdate=12 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn October 25, 2019, the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]] (CHED), granted autonomous status to DLSMHSI through the CHED Memorandum Order No. 12, series of 2019.

The latter term is not to be confused with [[Idealism|metaphysical idealism]], a viewpoint about existence and [[rationality]] unrelated to the ethical concept.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe term \"ideal\" is applied not only to individuals but also to organizations large and small from [[church (congregation)|independent churches]] to [[Activism|social activist groups]] to [[Political party|political parties]] to [[nation state]]s and more. An entity's ideals usually function as a way to set firm guidelines for [[decision making]], with the possibility of having to sacrifice and undergo loss being in the background. While ideals constitute [[fuzzy concept]]s without that clear-cut a definition, they remain an influential part not just of personal choice but of larger, civilization-wide social direction. Ideals as a topic receive both scholarly and layman discussion within a variety of fields including [[philosophy]] both historically and more recently.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the broader context of [[ethics]], the very terms 'ethical' and 'ideal' are inherently tied. Philosopher [[Rushworth Kidder]] has stated that \"standard definitions of ethics have typically included such phrases as 'the science of the ideal human character'\".<ref name=kai>{{citebook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MeTEDwAAQBAJ|first=Kai|last=Cabrera|publisher=[[Scientific e-Resources]]|date=2018|title=Ethics for Governance|ISBN=9781839473906|pages=1-3}}</ref> Whether [[Ethics in religion|based in religious traditions]] or [[Secular ethics|fundamentally secular]], an entity's relative prioritization of ideals often serves to indicate the extent of that entity's moral dedication. For example, someone who espouses the ideal of [[honesty]] yet expresses the willingness to [[lie]] to protect a friend demonstrates not only devotion to the different ideal of [[friendship]] but also belief in that other ideal to supersede honesty in importance. A particular case of this, frequently known as 'the inquiring murderer', is well-known as an intellectual criticism of [[Kantianism]] and its [[categorical imperative]].{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nBroader philosophical schools with a strong emphasis on idealistic viewpoints include [[Christian ethics]], [[Jewish ethics]], and [[Platonist ethics]].<ref name=rorty/> The development of state-based and international ideals in terms of large-scale social policy has additionally been long studied by scholars, their analysis looking particularly at the [[Foresight (psychology)|psychological foresight]] and determination required to manage effective foreign policy. [[Democratic peace theory]] in [[international relations]] study is an example.{{fact|date=April 2020}} [[Idealism in international relations|Idealism in the context of foreign relations]] generally involves advocating for institutions that enact measures such as [[international law]] implementation in order to avoid [[warfare]].<ref name=global/>\n\nA variety of different issues in analyzing idealistic ethics exist. Specifically, scholars such as [[Terry Eagleton]] have opined that the practical plausibility of particular ideals winds up being inverse to their intellectual legitimacy. Thus, an idealist with values at odds with his or her actual behavior stands apart, in Eagleton's view, from one who sets forth his or her ethics based fundamentally on his or her pragmatic desires, the latter person's set of principles losing the philosophically appealing nature of the former person's views.<ref name=terry/> As well, thinkers such as [[Richard Rorty]] have criticized the very concept of unchanging ideals existing somewhat separately from [[human nature]] in the first place.<ref name=rorty/> In the [[Politics|political context]], scholars such as [[Gerald Gaus]] have argued that particular strains of idealism cause individuals to wish for impossible political perfection and thus lose their sense of what constituents practical policy advocacy, ideals getting in the way of incremental yet meaningful progress.<ref name=will/>\n\nHistorically, advocates for idealism in the context of the \"[[Age of Enlightenment]]\" include [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[John Locke]]. Their emphasis on rational thinking led them to develop theories of ideal [[morality]] based around [[reason]]. Works authored by the former on the topic include the initial publication ''[[The Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals]]'' followed by ''[[The Critique of Practical Reason]]'', ''[[The Metaphysics of Morals]]'', ''[[Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View]]'', and ''[[Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason]]'', the later commentaries developing the intellectual figure's thinking.<ref name=kant/> To Kant, no clear-cut divide exists between morality and the [[Nature|natural world]], with empirical analysis of human [[psychology]] dovetailing with ethical analysis.<ref name=frederick>{{citejournal|title=Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View|journal=Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews|accessdate=April 7, 2020|authorlink=Frederick Rauscher|first=Frederick|last=Rauscher|url=https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/anthropology-from-a-pragmatic-point-of-view/}}</ref>\n\nIn terms of demonstrated life experience and the proliferation of personal stories via [[mass media]], multiple idealistic individuals have received attention as [[moral example]]s for others to draw understanding from. For instance, [[United States]] leaders known for their idealism include [[President of the United States|presidents]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]],<ref name=hull/><ref name=lecture/> [[Ronald Reagan]],<ref name=diggins/><ref name=zaretsky/> and [[Barack Obama]],<ref name=outdated/><ref name=sarson/><ref name=union/> while [[Europe|European]] officials similarly known for such ethical attitudes include [[Charles de Gaulle]], [[Prime Minister of France]] and senior general,<ref name=zaretsky/> and [[Konrad Adenauer]], [[Prime Minister of Germany]].<ref name=craig/><ref name=global/><ref name=hans/> [[Juan Manuel Santos]] of [[Colombia]] has gained attention in terms of the [[Central America|central]] and [[South America|south Americas]].<ref name=jesse/><ref name=laboratory/> Private individuals known for their prominent ideals include [[Fred Rogers]], U.S. [[television personality]],<ref name=rogers/> and [[Terry Fox]], Canadian [[athlete]] and [[Charitable organization|charity]] advocate.<ref name=derringer/><ref name=hero/><ref name=mile/> Multiple idealistically optimistic characters have been featured in prominent creative media, the [[Star Trek|''Star Trek'' franchise]] centered around [[space exploration]] being a well-known instance of fictional idealism.<ref name=peter/><ref name=sopan/> In addition, Artists known for creating songs with an atmosphere of idealism include [[singer-songwriters]] [[David Bowie]],<ref name=bowie/> [[Curtis Mayfield]],<ref name=roots/> and [[Tom Paxton]],<ref name=weissman/> with [[Musical group|bands]] [[The Beatles]],<ref name=beatles/> [[Queen (band)|Queen]],<ref name=queen/> and [[Maze (band)|Maze]] being examples as well.<ref name=maze/>\n\n==Background and history==\n===Applications of different terminology===\nThe term \"idealism\" and the related labeling, whether self-applied or otherwise, of individuals and/or groups as being \"idealistic\" or against such viewpoints has a certain complexity to it. In the sense of [[Metaphysics|metaphysical thought]], \"[[idealism]]\" is generally described as centering around a particular view of objective reality versus the perception of reality; the question of whether or not potential [[knowledge]] exists independently to humanity or whether such knowledge is solely tied to experiences in the mind gets debated. Even within that particular intellectual sphere, the stamp of \"idealist\" as applied to particular [[Philosophy|philosophers]], with them often possessing rather nuanced views, attracts considerable controversy.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn [[Colloquialism|colloquial language]], the term \"ideal\" is often applied loosely, with varying circumstances getting described as such in highly different contexts. For instance, in [[cooking]] the descriptions of certain ingredient portions, heating temperatures, preparation times, and the like are often labeled as \"ideal\" or otherwise. Such uses of the term are also highly distinct from the historical and social concept of having an \"ethical ideal\" as such.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Definitions and justifications===\n[[File:Plato_Pio-Clementino_Inv305_n2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] philosopher [[Plato]] argued that ideals exist in a kind of independence from humanity such that [[reason]] discovers the principles rather than simply creates them.<ref name=nicholas/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[Untied States|American]] philosopher [[Ralph Barton Perry]] has defined idealistic [[morality]] as being the result of a particular viewpoint about knowledge itself, writing in his book ''The Moral Economy'',\n{{Quote|\"Moral idealism means to interpret life consistently with ethical, scientific, and metaphysical truth. It endeavors to justify the maximum of hope, without compromising or confusing any enlightenment judgement of truth. In this it is, I think, not only consistent with the spirit of a liberal and rational age but also with the primary motive of religion. There can be no religion... without an open and candid mind as well as an indomitable purpose.\"<ref name=perry/>}}\n\nSomewhat in contrast, American scholar [[Nicholas Rescher]] has stated that the metaphysical nature of ideals gives them a particular status as \"useful fictions\" in terms of their special existence, writing in his book ''Ethical Idealism: An Inquiry Into the Nature and Function of Ideals'',\n{{quote|\"The 'reality' of an ideal lies not in its substantive realization in some separate domain but in its formative impetus upon human thought and action in this imperfect world. The object at issue with an ideal does not, and cannot, ''exist'' as such. What does, however, exist is the idea of such an object. Existing, as it must, in thought alone (in the manner appropriate to ideas), it exerts a powerful[ly] organizing and motivating force on our thinking, providing at once a standard of appraisal and [also] a stimulus to action.\"<ref name=nicholas/>}}\n\nNonetheless, multiple thinkers have asserted that ideals as such constitute things that ought to be said to exist in the real world, having a substance partly to the same extent as flesh and blood people and similar concrete entities. A prominent example of this certain viewpoint is the iconic Greek philosopher [[Plato]]. To him, ideals represent self-contained objects existing in their own domain that humanity discovered through [[reason]] rather than invented out of whole cloth for narrow benefit. Thus, while existing in relation to the human mind, ideals still possess a certain kind of metaphysical independence according to Plato.<ref name=nicholas/>\n\n===Historical development and recent analysis===\n[[Image:Gerome - Diogenes.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ancient cynicism|Ancient cynics]] such as [[Diogenes]] dismissed [[Optimism|optimistic]] views of [[human nature]] as baseless given common brutality, with the moral ideals of the time receiving skepticism as he sought his own internal compass.<ref name=cynic/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the wider context of [[ethics]], the very terms 'ethical' and 'ideal' have been inherently tied. Philosopher [[Rushworth Kidder]] has stated that \"standard definitions of ethics have typically included such phrases as 'the science of the ideal human character'\".<ref name=kai/> Thus, ideals have been the topic of discussion and debate since the beginnings of organized human [[civilization]]. The types of ideals dealt with during the [[history of philosophy]] have varied widely over the many centuries, many conceptions existing of what moral idealism actually is and how it gets applied in actual life experiences.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nFrom [[Ancient history|the far distant history]] to today, multiple philosophers have remarked that human beings appear to, by instinct, behave in a matter with few if any ideals and even general morals of whatever kind. The works of [[United Kingdom|British]] thinker [[David Hume]], for instance, explicitly declared people to be inherent \"[[Slavery|slaves]]\" to their passions.<ref name=kant/> When articulating a particularly nuanced theory of morality, Hume's writings labeled it folly to emphasize what people hopefully wish to achieve and additionally argued that enforcing ideals without proper grounding in practical, already existing mores undermines society itself.<ref>{{citenews|journal=[[The Nation (journal)|The Nation]]|accessdate=April 7, 2020|title=Hume's Call to Action|authorlink=Richard Bourke (academic)|date=April 20, 2016|first=Richard|last=Bourke|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/humes-call-to-action/}}</ref>\n\n[[Ancient cynicism|Cynics of the ancient world]] frequently referred to humanity in general as not only not perfectible but fundamentally depraved. The historical [[Greece|Greek]] figure of [[Diogenes]], while arguing that some individuals could through great effort achieve some kind of a moral dignity, was a prominent example in his dismissal of the values common in his day. He sought his own path based on a particular set of ideals that involved begging on the streets, living in a barrel, and wearing rags.<ref name=cynic>{{citeweb|url=https://academyofideas.com/2013/05/diogenes-the-cynic/|title=Diogenes the Cynic|accessdate=April 6, 2020|date=May 26, 2013|website=[[AcademyofIdeas.com]]}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Sermon-on-the-mount-tiffany.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Sermon on the Mount]] has constituted a key moment in the development of [[Christian ethics]] and the sense of idealism embodied within that school of thought.{{fact|date=April 2020}}]]\n\nIn both [[Jewish ethics]] and later [[Christian ethics]], however, advocacy for a stridently idealistic view of the world, in which principles get held over personal convenience and even otherwise perfectly logical expectations, has attracted praise. [[Golden rule]] based moral standards have involved restrictions such as holding back the quest for [[Vengeance (concept)|vengeance]] by the wronged such that punishment only gets applied in a limited, specific fashion, this example being later evaluated as the [[tit-for-tat]] strategy in [[game theory]]. In terms of [[Christianity]], the teachings of the [[Gospels]] and particularly the setting forth of clear-cut principles on the [[Sermon on the Mount]] have constituted an extension of the golden rule; individuals, under [[Jesus Christ|Jesus']] exhortations, have gotten called to hold to the ideal of treating other people even better than they rationally expect to be treated back. Specific phrases such as \"[[turn the other cheek]]\" have come about in terms of moral instruction to effectively convey this idealism.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nWhile [[Western world|Western nations]] have widely retained these influences, in practical terms a great many powerful rulers and prominent thinkers since the [[fall of the Roman Empire]] have pushed back on higher notions of idealistic ethics. Many have done so based on little other than expediency. However, whether explicitly in words or implicitly through deeds, more cynical figures have counter-argued from points of view that can broadly be labeled as \"[[moral relativism]]\". As the arguments have gone, human beings have been little more than crude matter and cannot reasonably be held to act based in any sort of larger principle; survival has remained people's core instinct such that civilization, through relativist eyes, functions as a thin veneer over base instincts.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nMultiple philosophers have argued in favor of particular types of idealism as well for years. The course of the \"[[Age of Enlightenment]]\" from the 17th to the 19th centuries, being a movement that in large part centered around the application of rationality-based principles such as the [[scientific method]] upon [[human nature]], caused increased interest in ethical philosophy as a field of study. Notions of \"benevolence\" attracted widespread attention in terms of [[Government|governance]], with leaders exhorted to act based on idealistic principles and to particularly champion causes such as the facilitating of [[the arts]], increased [[Education|educational efforts]], effective stewardship of [[national resources]], and so on. This movement increased trends away from [[absolute monarchy]] and [[dictatorship]] towards that of [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[Republic|republican government]]. The scientifically based, forward thinking viewpoint about human nature when applied to socio-political organization became later known as \"[[classical liberalism]]\".{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[File:Locke-John-LOC.jpg|thumb|right|Philosopher [[John Locke]], a prominent figure of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment era]], articulated a vision of the individual and collective pursuit of ideals arising from the logical study and analysis of the state of nature.<ref name=kant/>]]\n\nIn terms of broader discussions on ethics, many classical Enlightenment thinkers such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[John Locke]] have famously argued that strong moral standards on individual choice exist based upon standards of [[rationality]] that can be found through [[Logic|logical analysis]] by reasonable observers. Specifically, instrumental principles based on satisfying one\u2019s desires made up the basis for morality through Hobbes' approach. External principles existing in the discoverable state of nature outside of human experience that became possible to tease out due to personal study constituted Locke's theoretical background for ideals and broader ethics.<ref name=kant>{{citeweb|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/|title=Kant\u2019s Moral Philosophy|accessdate=April 8, 2020|publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|date=July 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith respect to social order, Locke's highly influential writings applied rational principles to governance in support of the doctrine of [[social contract theory]], which permeated Enlightenment discussions about the best form of organizing a country. Locke's works such as the ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'' set forth an ethical framework in which rational individuals establish a government in order to guarantee their fundamental rights and possess the understanding that they not only can but should alter said government when rational application of the fair-minded \"[[rule of law]]\" has broken down, change taking place when [[liberty]] no longer receives protection. Locke criticized competing theories such as the [[divine right of kings]], which the thinker viewed as folly.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn terms of individual thinking on principles, Lockean morality has emphasized holding to prominent ideals about human behavior, a particular one being the power of education. Locke wrote of its importance in depth within the pages of ''[[Some Thoughts Concerning Education]]''. Outlining the best way to rear children in his eyes, Lockean arguments stressed that virtuous actions by adults arose as a direct result of the habits of body and mind taught during youth by forward thinking instructors.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nLocke wrote in his work ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' dividing rational understanding into three inherent areas of scope, the philosopher defining the second as \"practica\" and describing it as,\n{{quote|\"The skill of right applying our own powers and actions, for the attainment of things good and useful. The most considerable... is ethics, which is the seeking out those rules and measures of human actions, which lead to happiness, and the means to practise them. The end of this is not bare speculation and the knowledge of truth; but right, and a conduct suitable to it.\"<ref>John Locke. ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''. Chapter XXI. ''Of the Division of the Sciences''.</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Immanuel_Kant_3.jpg|thumb|right|Thinker [[Immanuel Kant]]'s views on idealistic morality aligned the human ethical experience with that of rationality and the greater world,<ref name=frederick/> the philosopher seeing the defiance of ideals such as his \"[[categorical imperative]]\" concept as not only being wrong on principle but also illogical.<ref name=kant/>]]\n\n[[Germany|German]] philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]'s particular view of [[human nature]] and intellectual inquiry, later summed up under the banner of \"[[Kantianism]]\", stressed the inherent power of logical thinking in terms of moral analysis. Kant's advocacy for the \"[[categorical imperative]]\", a doctrine through which every individual choice has to be made with the consideration of the decider that it ought to be a universally held maxim, took place in the broader context of his metaphysical views. In Kant's writings, defiance of higher idealistic principles was not only wrong in a practical sense but in a fundamentally rational and thus moral sense as well.<ref name=kant/>\n\nWorks authored by Kant on the topic include the initial publication ''[[The Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals]]'' followed by ''[[The Critique of Practical Reason]]'', ''[[The Metaphysics of Morals]]'', ''[[Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View]]'', ''[[Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason]]'', the latter commentaries developing the intellectual figure's thinking.<ref name=kant/> Within the pages of ''Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View'' in particular, the philosopher articulated a vision of people as by their very essence driven by meaningful ethics. Through the lens of Kant's doctrine, no ironclad divide has existed between morality and the [[Nature|natural world]], with empirical analysis of human [[psychology]] dovetailing with studies of people's ideals.<ref name=frederick/>\n\nSumming up Kant's views on ideals in context, scholar Frederick P. Van De Pitte has written,\n{{quote|\"Kant realized that man's rational capacity alone is not sufficient to constitute his dignity and elevate him above the brutes. If reason only enables him to do for himself what instinct does for the animal, then it would indicate for man no higher aim or destiny than that of the brute but only a different way of attaining the same end. However, reason is man's most essential attribute because it is the means by which a truly distinctive dimension is made possible for him. Reason, that is, reflective awareness, makes it possible to distinguish between good and bad, and thus morality can be made the ruling purpose of life. Because man can consider an array of possibilities, and which among them is the most desirable, he can strive to make himself and his world into a realization of his ideals.\"<ref name=anthropology/>}}\n\nModern Western philosophy in terms of its discussion of ideals largely takes place within the framework of Enlightenment thinking, with figures such as the aforementioned Hobbes, Kant, and Locke dominating debate. As per the [[United Nations Declaration of Human Rights]], itself an evolution from the earlier [[American Declaration of Independence]] and the [[Constitution of the United States]], many theorizing academics of the 19th century and the 20th century have set forth an [[Optimism|optimistic]] view of humanity. Through this moralistic lens, all individuals by nature of their mere existence have been thought to have been born inherently [[Good and evil|good]], inherently [[Social equality|equal]], and inherently [[Freedom|free]].{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nA defining inflection point of this trend has been the experience of [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]]. The historical memory has been argued to have created a sort of dualistic approach to [[ideology]] in which [[Capitalism|capitalistic]] [[democracy]], centered around classical liberalism, gets inherently pitted forever in struggle with [[Tyranny|tyrannies]], centered around the [[Social stratification|stratification of various groups over others]] and mass misery. In the aftermath of the end of the [[Cold War]], studies upon moral idealism have often asked if Enlightenment viewpoints face an inherent intellectual challenge that the doctrines cannot eventually overcome.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nWith the advent of the 21st century, philosophizers have debated the rapid evolution of different cultures, particularly given advancing technology, and the seeming acceptance of [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian values]] previously thought of as radical or undesirable by [[Center-left politics|center-left]], [[Political moderation|moderate]], and [[Center-right politics|center-right]] individuals. The conflict between these people, many of them belonging to younger generations such as the [[Millennials]], and those [[Political extremism|political extremists]] of the [[Far-right politics|global far-right movement]], the social trend often called \"[[Neo-nationalism|new nationalism]]\", has defined new distinctions between what it means to be a \"moral idealist\". As well, the question of the fundamental [[Biology|biological]] advancement of humanity itself has attracted much attention. What a [[transhuman]] or even [[posthuman]] individual would possess terms of ideals in contrast with regular human beings has remained an open question.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the broadest sense, the question of whether or not humanity as a whole has fundamentally progressed towards a set of moral ideals over time has never achieved any particular consensus. Examples of philosophers who argue partially in support of the notion include the American thinker [[Richard Rorty]], a figure who has criticized the very concept of unchanging ethical principles set forth in inherent nature while still lauding general social progress.<ref name=rorty/> In contrast, multiple scholars concerned with issues such as [[global climate change]] and potential use of [[weapons of mass destruction]] in future [[warfare]] have lamented particular [[Technology|technological advancements]] and related alterations in broader social culture, the thinkers arguing that fundamental moral progress has truly not occurred given forms of increasing danger to humanity.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nOne optimistic view arising in the 20th century and continuing to receive notice is that of prominent [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] figure [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]]. He famously predicted that humanity will eventually advance in terms of not just scientific development through natural and engineered [[biological evolution]] but also idealistic morality to a sort of final oneness regarded by him as the '[[Omega Point]]', a mode of existence taking place not only without hatred, pain, and misery but with perfect collective action and consciousness. Known as the \"Catholic Darwin\", his view of evolutionary advancement came out of a religious context through which he identified humanity's final state with Jesus Christ as the \"[[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]]\" or sacred \"Word\". To Chardin, the power of [[love]] has constituted a sort of elemental drive as strong as that of [[Combustion|fire]] and other natural forces.<ref name=allen/><ref name=langan>{{citenews|date=May 20, 2018|title=Commentary: The Royal Wedding and Jesuit Priest & Philosopher Teilard de Chardin|url=https://www.nbc-2.com/story/38232094/commentary-the-royal-wedding-and-jesuit-priest-philosopher-teilard-de-chardin|first=Michael D.|last=Langan|periodical=[[NBC-2.com]]|accessdate=April 9, 2020}}</ref><ref name=salem/> A [[Geology|geologist]], [[Palentology|paleontologist]], and [[Jesuit]] priest, Chardin was later described by a ''Cyclopedia of World Authors'' volume as having \"combined his scientific beliefs and Christian convictions in an idealistic [and] evolutionary vision of the universe.\"<ref name=salem>{{citebook|pages=1984|date=1997|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6moYAAAAIAAJ|title=Cyclopedia of World Authors, Volume 5|ISBN=9780893564346|publisher=[[Salem Press]]|editor=Magill, Frank N.}}</ref>\n\n[[Pope Benedict XVI]] notably made an approving reference to Chardin's views within a reflection on the [[Epistle to the Romans]] during a [[vespers]] service in [[Aosta Cathedral]], the Pope asserting before the audience,\n{{quote|\"It's the great vision that later Teilhard de Chardin... had: At the end we will have a true cosmic liturgy, where the cosmos becomes a living host.

In some theories of applied ethics, relative importance has gotten assigned to certain social preferences over others as a way to [[Dispute resolution|resolve disputes effectively]]. In analysis of [[legal theory]], for instance, [[judge]]s have been sometimes called on to resolve the balance between the ideal of [[truth]], which would likely advise hearing out all evidence, and the ideal of broader [[social equality]], which would likely advise seeking to restore goodwill between individuals regardless of specific findings during a particular case. Said judges have also been required to consider the principle of the [[right to a speedy trial]] as well, which places limits on the previous two ideals given the time involved in ferreting out details.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn an August 2005 address, philosopher [[Richard Rorty]] remarked upon the \"moral idealism common to Platonism, Judaism, and Christianity\" and the related notion of strictly specified principles through the lens of applied ethics, asserting to a group of business professionals,\n{{quote|\"[I]ndividuals become aware of more alternatives, and therefore wiser, as they grow older. The human race as a whole has become wiser as history has moved along. The source of these new alternatives is the human imagination.

Specifically, certain authors known as \"[[New atheism|new atheists]]\" such as [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Christopher Hitchens]] have argued that newly emerging forms of [[secular ethics]] constitute an approach of people treating each other that is more logical, just, and reasonable when seen as a rejoinder to previous forms of \"traditional values\". At the same time, multiple thinkers have advocated for moral relativism and a reduced or non-existent sense of holding to previously well-promoted ideals as a direct result of their wholesale rejection of religion. As well, scholars regardless of personal faith background have commented about the complex nature of ethics when taken from spiritual movements.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Idealistic appeals in practice==\n===In conceptual and historical politics===\n\n[[File:Pericles.jpg|thumb|right|Greek statesman [[Pericles]]' vision of [[Athenian democracy]] stressed a sense of what he saw as core ideals, particularly the intelligence and tolerance displayed by Athenians.<ref name=pericles/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nIdeals have played a role in [[politics]] for [[millennia]]. For example, iconic Greek statesman [[Pericles]] famously presented an ideal-based view of the [[Mediterranean]] world. In 431, shortly after the [[Peloponnesian War]] had started, Pericles' \"Funeral Oration\" made to commemorate fallen soldiers, described for posterity by the historian [[Thucydides]], presented a view of [[Athens]] and the city-state's broader civilization that emphasized a sense of cleverness and open-mindedness that Pericles believed gave it the strength to rise to different challenges.<ref name=pericles>{{citenews|journal=[[Pbs.org]]|url=https://www.pbs.org/empires/thegreeks/background/36.html|title=Pericles Funeral Oration in Depth|accessdate=April 5, 2020}}</ref> Other early historical figures known for appealing to ethical ideals in their [[Public speaking|oratory]] include Roman statesman [[Cato the Elder]], the figure's commentary on [[Hellenic Greece|Hellenized]] values leading to his moral appeal among supporters. In contrast to what he saw as [[decadence]] spreading into [[Rome]] and nearby areas from elsewhere, Cato articulated support for what he labeled as traditional Roman ethics.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nMost [[Revolution|political revolutions]] have drawn support from the mass appeal of a certain moral idealism in contrast to the doctrines of those holding [[Power (sociology)|power]], having the various grievances with the status quo created from real or perceived misrule spark ethical debate. During the [[French Revolution]], the rhetorical principles of ''\"[[Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9]]\"'' (English: ''\"Liberty, Equality, Brotherhood\"'') got raised to the status of clear-cut ideals; the new [[nation state]] constituted a sort of grand experiment in what became in de facto and later de jure a new religion. Many political movements in modern times have centered themselves upon multiple ideals found to be mutually reinforcing. Recent examples have included the [[peace movement]] and the broader opposition expressed worldwide to war in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]] as well as elsewhere.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn many cases current and historical, instances have popped up in which proclaimed ideals simply weren't lived up to by various figures while in office, despite claims made by the officials before taking power and since attaining it. In [[British English]], politicians openly changing their opinions in defiance of previous assertions about their ethics have been labeled as making a \"u-turn\". In [[American English]], similar individuals have been pejoratively called \"flip-floppers\". While different, the terms [[U-turn (politics)|have meant the same thing]].{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIdealism in the context of politics has attracted criticism from multiple fronts. For instance, U.S. philosopher [[Gerald Gaus]], the author of ''[[The Tyranny of the Ideal: Justice in a Diverse Society]]'', has prominently argued that an overriding emphasis on ideals causes individuals to wish for impossible political perfection and thus lose their sense of what constituents practical policy advocacy as well as logical choices during [[Election|elections]]. Gaus has made other warnings such as cautioning that people can lose their sense of how much has already been achieved and how well current situations have become in certain circumstances. In general, Gaus has advocated for [[compromise]] and incremental socio-political reform.<ref name=will>{{citenews|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/8/4/12376522/political-idealism-enemy|date=August 4, 2016|title=How political idealism leads us astray|accessdate=April 4, 2020|authorlink=Will Wilkinson|first=Will|last=Wilkinson|publisher=[[Vox.com]]}}</ref>\n\n===In traditional achievement===\n[[File:TerryFoxToronto19800712.JPG|thumb|right|[[Athlete]] [[Terry Fox]] helped redefine the cultural image of [[Disability (human beings)|disabled individuals]] in his native [[Canada]] and elsewhere, his [[Charitable organization|charity]] work and upbeat attitude creating a reputation as an idealist and humanitarian.<ref name=derringer/><ref name=hero/><ref name=mile/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn a less abstract sense, multiple famous private individuals have been thought to embody certain ideals due to multiple factors such as their [[courage]], [[intelligence]], [[personal endurance]], and so on.

[blazing] a trail that inspired millions to follow.\"<ref name=mile/>}}\n\nAs well, multiple figures with a sincerely revered or otherwise prominent status within religious and broadly spiritual beliefs have been seen by individuals within those movements as representative of an ethical idealism worth mimicking. In [[Islam]], for instance, the life of the prophet [[Muhammad]] has been held up as a comprehensive ideal for Muslims to study. However, all of his words and deeds must be interpreted for believers through the lens of his life's broader path and the larger religious context, according to Islamic scholars. Multiple other prophets exist in Islam and have been considered worth devoted study including [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]] and previous figures such as [[Abraham in Islam|Abraham]] and [[Moses in Islam|Moses]].{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the Jewish context, the term \"[[mensch]]\" has gotten frequently used to describe an individual of great worth due to his or her moral actions. Originally coming from [[Yiddish]], the labeling of idealistic people as such has since become co-opted into regular use within the [[English language]] in certain areas.{{fact|date=April 2020}} Different scholarly traditions within [[Judaism]] have articulated theories of promoting moral behavior as well as more generally seeking to improve both humanity and nature in order to meet higher ideals; the process has been known as \"[[tikkun olam]]\", a term often translated to mean \"repairing the world\". In 2013, the surveying analysis group [[Pew Research Center]] polled [[American Jews]] what specific traits were essential to Jewish identity and found that 56% said \"working for justice/equality\".<ref>{{citenews|accessdate=April 10, 2020|url=https://atlantajewishtimes.timesofisrael.com/tikkun-olam-different-strokes-for-different-folks2/|date=September 12, 2018|title=Tikkun Olam: Different Strokes For Different Folks|first=Dave|last=Schechter|periodical=[[The Atlanta Jewish Times]]}}</ref>\n\nChristian thinking has often encouraged regular people to highlight certain individuals as ethical examples. In both [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] and the traditions of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Saint|saints]] have received veneration due to their heroic deeds.

No consensus has emerged in any particular area, though much research has been done in the past several decades. Examples of studied categorizations include [[age]], [[ethnicity]], [[gender identity]], [[nationality]], and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]. The general field of [[anthropology]] has studied the evolution of differing societies and come to contradictory conclusions about whether or not certain ideals can be said to be innate to human existence and/or universal in terms of rational advocacy.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nEmpirical research has demonstrated differences between [[Man|men]] and [[Woman|women]] in terms of their relative approaches to idealistic morality. Specifically, a 2018 article published by the ''International Journal of Management Science and Business Administration'' stated that six scholarly studies published in the past had determined that women value ethical principles at a higher level than men in the context of [[business]] and [[economics]]. However, some of those had found only modest differences. As well, four published reports in the past had failed to detect any significant differences between the sexes.<ref name=poor>{{citejournal|title=Comparative Business Ethics \u2013 Idealism and Relativism in Light of Empirical Researches in Eight CEE Countries, Finland, and Turkey|journal=International Journal of Management Science and Business Administration|volume=4|issue=5|date=July 2018|pages=23-33|accessdate=April 11, 2020|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.18775/ijmsba.1849-5664-5419.2014.45.1003|author=Po\u00f3r, J\u00f3zsef|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nThe aforementioned article evaluated distinctions in [[nationality]] and determined that significant differences exist between the various peoples when it comes to idealism in the working environment. In depth, the analysis of eight different European nations, constituting of [[Croatia]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Hungary]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Poland]], appeared to the researchers to have illustrated the effects of contrasting social mores. For example, [[Culture of Croatia|Croatian culture]] faced the problem that \"[t]he significant majority of employees are satisfied with the minimum level of ethical behavior\" while the Finns were labeled as living in a \"traditionally seen... corruption-free or low-corruption and transparent country\".<ref name=poor/>\n\nIn contrast to only finding slight differences in terms of idealism by sex, the study concluded that particular gaps exist between [[Human generation|generations]]; broadly speaking, the older an individual was, the more importance they gave to idealistic ethics.<ref name=poor/>\n\n===Ideals versus absolute or conditional obligations===\n\n[[File:Blood test (1).jpg|thumb|right|Obligated social standards, such as the various [[Social norms|norms]] around the [[Doctor\u2013patient relationship|medical professional and patient relationship]], have been argued by thinkers as existing at a different plane than idealistic moral views.<ref name=norbert/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nPhilosopher [[Norbert Paulo]] has stated that, in common life, ideals as such appear to exist in relation to general social obligations. Many of the latter concepts have tended to appear, according to Paulo, absolute and essentially mandatory while also existing in highly particular circumstances. For instance, Paulo has written, [[Physician|physicians]] and [[Nursing|nurses]] face a variety of [[Doctor\u2013patient relationship|ethical obligations imposed on them when treating their patients]] that regular individuals encountering said patients randomly do not. He had added that a continuum exists between clear-cut, widely held obligations applied via [[Social norm|social norms]] and vague ones only partially behold to cultural sanction.<ref name=norbert/>\n\nPaulo's argument, thus, has concluded that idealist behavior takes place at a behavioral and mental level above and beyond mere social rules, such actions being \"warranted\" yet \"not strictly required\" either while their optional nature sets them up as being \"praiseworthy\". Ideals represent a method of putting into action an individual's [[personal character]] and its given traits such that, Paulo has argued, moral standards get fleshed out beyond the rigid framework of mere obligations. One person's altruistic caring for another generally has constituted a particular example.<ref name=norbert/>\n\n===Ideals versus virtues===\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe line between an ideal and a [[virtue]] has been difficult to access. Ideals have been argued to inherently involve aspirations while virtues function as direct guides for assigned conduct given social standards.<ref name=norbert/> Analysis has run into problems given that both entities are [[fuzzy concept]]s. In general, some philosophers have argued that an ideal usually constitutes something more inherent that one can make a [[Habituation|habit]] while virtues, instead, necessarily involve going above and beyond regular decision making in order to actively strive for something. Thus, these thinkers have stated, virtues inherently constitute a behavior that's by its very nature highly difficult to turn into a regular practice. Other philosophers have made the exact opposite argument and seen virtues as fundamentally philosophically weaker entities than ideals.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nGiven the complexity of putting ideals into practice, not to mention resolving conflicts between them, many individuals have chosen to narrowly pick a certain group of them and then harden them into absolute [[dogma]]. Political theorist [[Bernard Crick]] has stated that a way to solve this [[dilemma]] is to have ideals that themselves are descriptive of a generalized process rather than a specific outcome, particularly when the latter is hard to achieve.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nKant wrote in his work ''Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View'' pitting idealism against the enactment of personal [[vice]], the philospher arguing,\n{{quote|\"Young man! Deny yourself satisfaction (of amusement, of debauchery, of love, etc.), not with the Stoical intention of complete abstinence, but with the refined Epicurean intention of having in view an ever-growing pleasure. This stinginess with the cash of your vital urge makes you definitely richer through the postponement of pleasure, even if you should, for the most part, renounce the indulgence of it until the end of your life. The awareness of having pleasure under your control is, like everything idealistic, more fruitful and more abundant than everything that satisfies the sense through indulgence because it is thereby simultaneously consumed and consequently lost from the aggregate of totality.\"<ref name=anthropology>{{citebook|title=[[Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View]]|authorlink=Immanuel Kant|first=Immanuel|last=Kant|date=1996|translator=Victor Lyle Dowdell|publisher=[[Southern Illinois University Press]]|ISBN=9780809320608}}</ref>}}\n\n===Relative ideals===\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[Robert S. Hartman]] has contended that since, colloquially, labeling an entity as ideal means that something is the best member of the set of all things of that class, thus the term has particular implications when used in an ethical context. For example, he has stated, the ideal student constitutes the best member of the set of all students in exactly the same way that the ideal circle is the best circle that can be imagined of the class of all circles. Since one can define the properties that the ideal member of a class should have, according to Hartman, the value of any actual object can be empirically determined by comparing it to the ideal. The closer an object's actual properties match up to the properties of the ideal, the better the object is to Hartman. Thus, a bumpy circle drawn in the sand is worse than a very smooth one drawn with a compass' aid, but both are better than a regularly made square.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nFor Hartman, the world in general has presented a situation in which each particular entity ought usually to become more like its ideal if possible. This entails that, in [[ethics]], each individual should analogously to become more like the hypothetical ideal person, and a person's morality can actually be measured by examining how close they live up to their ideal self, in Hartman's view.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Totalizing ideals versus emergent ideals===\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\nThe question of to what extent one can hold to certain ideals practically and how facing resistance will shape them has attracted debate from multiple thinkers. The related issue of to what extent idealistic morality held by individuals reflects broader cultures has done so as well. The extent to which human beings think through their behavior irrationally or rationally has been a major issue in these such discussions.<ref name=kelly/><ref name=terry/>\n\nOne 21st century philosopher who has delved into the topics is [[Terry Eagleton]]. Writing in his book ''After Theory'', he has commented critically about the practicality of ethical idealism, Eagleton arguing,\n{{quote|\"Moral values which state what you ought to do are impressively idealistic, but too blatantly at odds with your behaviour. Moral values\nwhich reflect what you actually do are far more plausible, but only at the cost of no longer serving to legitimate your activity.\"<ref name=terry>{{citebook|date=2004|authorlink=Terry Eagleton||title=After Theory|publisher=[[Penguin Publishing]]|pages=151-152|ISBN=9780141927886|first=Terry|last=Eagleton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T3N6zL1qyHQC}}</ref>}}\n\nAnother 21st century philosopher who has questioned traditional understandings of idealistic morality is [[Kwame Anthony Appiah]]. In particular, his book ''As If: Idealization and Ideals'' examined the usefulness of the concepts and the processes through which they've been articulated. Appiah found fault in the general assumptions made by certain thinkers of human rationality and advocated for a larger understanding of the practical nature of the idealization process among scholars of multiple disciplines as well as laypeople.<ref name=kelly/>\n\nIn depth, Appiah's book presented a nuanced picture of ethical idealism in the context of cultural organization, the philosopher writing,\n{{quote|\"The history of our collective moral learning doesn't start with the growing acceptance of a picture of an ideal society. It starts with the rejection of some current practice or structure, which we come to see as wrong. You learn to be in favor of equality by noticing what is wrong with the unequal treatment of blacks, or women, or working-class or lower-caste people.\"<ref name=kelly>{{citejournal|url=https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/as-if-idealization-and-ideals/|title=As If: Idealization and Ideals|accessdate=April 11, 2020|journal=Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews|first=Thomas|last=Kelly}}</ref>}}\n\n==Instances of morally idealistic views in created media==\n===Idealism in film and television===\n[[File:Leonard Nimoy William Shatner Star Trek 1968.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Star Trek franchise|''Star Trek'' franchise]] has traditionally set forth an optimistic view of humanity, stressing the capacity for moral idealism amidst adversity.<ref name=peter/><ref name=sopan/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nMultiple forms of media in terms of [[Film|filmed]] and [[Television series|serially televised]] production have portrayed issues surrounding ideals and characters facing tests of their personal ethics.

The latter term is not to be confused with [[Idealism|metaphysical idealism]], a viewpoint about existence and [[rationality]] unrelated to the ethical concept.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe term \"ideal\" is applied not only to individuals but also to organizations large and small from [[church (congregation)|independent churches]] to [[Activism|social activist groups]] to [[Political party|political parties]] to [[nation state]]s and more. An entity's ideals usually function as a way to set firm guidelines for [[decision making]], with the possibility of having to sacrifice and undergo loss being in the background. While ideals constitute [[fuzzy concept]]s without that clear-cut a definition, they remain an influential part not just of personal choice but of larger, civilization-wide social direction. Ideals as a topic receive both scholarly and layman discussion within a variety of fields including [[philosophy]] both historically and more recently.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the broader context of [[ethics]], the very terms 'ethical' and 'ideal' are inherently tied. Philosopher [[Rushworth Kidder]] has stated that \"standard definitions of ethics have typically included such phrases as 'the science of the ideal human character'\".<ref name=kai>{{citebook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MeTEDwAAQBAJ|first=Kai|last=Cabrera|publisher=[[Scientific e-Resources]]|date=2018|title=Ethics for Governance|ISBN=9781839473906|pages=1-3}}</ref> Whether [[Ethics in religion|based in religious traditions]] or [[Secular ethics|fundamentally secular]], an entity's relative prioritization of ideals often serves to indicate the extent of that entity's moral dedication. For example, someone who espouses the ideal of [[honesty]] yet expresses the willingness to [[lie]] to protect a friend demonstrates not only devotion to the different ideal of [[friendship]] but also belief in that other ideal to supersede honesty in importance. A particular case of this, frequently known as 'the inquiring murderer', is well-known as an intellectual criticism of [[Kantianism]] and its [[categorical imperative]].{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nBroader philosophical schools with a strong emphasis on idealistic viewpoints include [[Christian ethics]], [[Jewish ethics]], and [[Platonist ethics]].<ref name=rorty/> The development of state-based and international ideals in terms of large-scale social policy has additionally been long studied by scholars, their analysis looking particularly at the [[Foresight (psychology)|psychological foresight]] and determination required to manage effective foreign policy. [[Democratic peace theory]] in [[international relations]] study is an example.{{fact|date=April 2020}} [[Idealism in international relations|Idealism in the context of foreign relations]] generally involves advocating for institutions that enact measures such as [[international law]] implementation in order to avoid [[warfare]].<ref name=global/>\n\nA variety of different issues in analyzing idealistic ethics exist. Specifically, scholars such as [[Terry Eagleton]] have opined that the practical plausibility of particular ideals winds up being inverse to their intellectual legitimacy. Thus, an idealist with values at odds with his or her actual behavior stands apart, in Eagleton's view, from one who sets forth his or her ethics based fundamentally on his or her pragmatic desires, the latter person's set of principles losing the philosophically appealing nature of the former person's views.<ref name=terry/> As well, thinkers such as [[Richard Rorty]] have criticized the very concept of unchanging ideals existing somewhat separately from [[human nature]] in the first place.<ref name=rorty/> In the [[Politics|political context]], scholars such as [[Gerald Gaus]] have argued that particular strains of idealism cause individuals to wish for impossible political perfection and thus lose their sense of what constituents practical policy advocacy, ideals getting in the way of incremental yet meaningful progress.<ref name=will/>\n\nHistorically, advocates for idealism in the context of the \"[[Age of Enlightenment]]\" include [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[John Locke]]. Their emphasis on rational thinking led them to develop theories of ideal [[morality]] based around [[reason]]. Works authored by the former on the topic include the initial publication ''[[The Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals]]'' followed by ''[[The Critique of Practical Reason]]'', ''[[The Metaphysics of Morals]]'', ''[[Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View]]'', and ''[[Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason]]'', the later commentaries developing the intellectual figure's thinking.<ref name=kant/> To Kant, no clear-cut divide exists between morality and the [[Nature|natural world]], with empirical analysis of human [[psychology]] dovetailing with ethical analysis.<ref name=frederick>{{citejournal|title=Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View|journal=Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews|accessdate=April 7, 2020|authorlink=Frederick Rauscher|first=Frederick|last=Rauscher|url=https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/anthropology-from-a-pragmatic-point-of-view/}}</ref>\n\nIn terms of demonstrated life experience and the proliferation of personal stories via [[mass media]], multiple idealistic individuals have received attention as [[moral example]]s for others to draw understanding from. For instance, [[United States]] leaders known for their idealism include [[President of the United States|presidents]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]],<ref name=hull/><ref name=lecture/> [[Ronald Reagan]],<ref name=diggins/><ref name=zaretsky/> and [[Barack Obama]],<ref name=outdated/><ref name=sarson/><ref name=union/> while [[Europe|European]] officials similarly known for such ethical attitudes include [[Charles de Gaulle]], [[Prime Minister of France]] and senior general,<ref name=zaretsky/> and [[Konrad Adenauer]], [[Prime Minister of Germany]].<ref name=craig/><ref name=global/><ref name=hans/> [[Juan Manuel Santos]] of [[Colombia]] has gained attention in terms of the [[Central America|central]] and [[South America|south Americas]].<ref name=jesse/><ref name=laboratory/> Private individuals known for their prominent ideals include [[Fred Rogers]], U.S. [[television personality]],<ref name=rogers/> and [[Terry Fox]], Canadian [[athlete]] and [[Charitable organization|charity]] advocate.<ref name=derringer/><ref name=hero/><ref name=mile/> Multiple idealistically optimistic characters have been featured in prominent creative media, the [[Star Trek|''Star Trek'' franchise]] centered around [[space exploration]] being a well-known instance of fictional idealism.<ref name=peter/><ref name=sopan/> In addition, Artists known for creating songs with an atmosphere of idealism include [[singer-songwriters]] [[David Bowie]],<ref name=bowie/> [[Curtis Mayfield]],<ref name=roots/> and [[Tom Paxton]],<ref name=weissman/> with [[Musical group|bands]] [[The Beatles]],<ref name=beatles/> [[Queen (band)|Queen]],<ref name=queen/> and [[Maze (band)|Maze]] being examples as well.<ref name=maze/>\n\n==Background and history==\n===Applications of different terminology===\nThe term \"idealism\" and the related labeling, whether self-applied or otherwise, of individuals and/or groups as being \"idealistic\" or against such viewpoints has a certain complexity to it. In the sense of [[Metaphysics|metaphysical thought]], \"[[idealism]]\" is generally described as centering around a particular view of objective reality versus the perception of reality; the question of whether or not potential [[knowledge]] exists independently to humanity or whether such knowledge is solely tied to experiences in the mind gets debated. Even within that particular intellectual sphere, the stamp of \"idealist\" as applied to particular [[Philosophy|philosophers]], with them often possessing rather nuanced views, attracts considerable controversy.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn [[Colloquialism|colloquial language]], the term \"ideal\" is often applied loosely, with varying circumstances getting described as such in highly different contexts. For instance, in [[cooking]] the descriptions of certain ingredient portions, heating temperatures, preparation times, and the like are often labeled as \"ideal\" or otherwise. Such uses of the term are also highly distinct from the historical and social concept of having an \"ethical ideal\" as such.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Definitions and justifications===\n[[File:Plato_Pio-Clementino_Inv305_n2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] philosopher [[Plato]] argued that ideals exist in a kind of independence from humanity such that [[reason]] discovers the principles rather than simply creates them.<ref name=nicholas/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[Untied States|American]] philosopher [[Ralph Barton Perry]] has defined idealistic [[morality]] as being the result of a particular viewpoint about knowledge itself, writing in his book ''The Moral Economy'',\n{{Quote|\"Moral idealism means to interpret life consistently with ethical, scientific, and metaphysical truth. It endeavors to justify the maximum of hope, without compromising or confusing any enlightenment judgement of truth. In this it is, I think, not only consistent with the spirit of a liberal and rational age but also with the primary motive of religion. There can be no religion... without an open and candid mind as well as an indomitable purpose.\"<ref name=perry/>}}\n\nSomewhat in contrast, American scholar [[Nicholas Rescher]] has stated that the metaphysical nature of ideals gives them a particular status as \"useful fictions\" in terms of their special existence, writing in his book ''Ethical Idealism: An Inquiry Into the Nature and Function of Ideals'',\n{{quote|\"The 'reality' of an ideal lies not in its substantive realization in some separate domain but in its formative impetus upon human thought and action in this imperfect world. The object at issue with an ideal does not, and cannot, ''exist'' as such. What does, however, exist is the idea of such an object. Existing, as it must, in thought alone (in the manner appropriate to ideas), it exerts a powerful[ly] organizing and motivating force on our thinking, providing at once a standard of appraisal and [also] a stimulus to action.\"<ref name=nicholas/>}}\n\nNonetheless, multiple thinkers have asserted that ideals as such constitute things that ought to be said to exist in the real world, having a substance partly to the same extent as flesh and blood people and similar concrete entities. A prominent example of this certain viewpoint is the iconic Greek philosopher [[Plato]]. To him, ideals represent self-contained objects existing in their own domain that humanity discovered through [[reason]] rather than invented out of whole cloth for narrow benefit. Thus, while existing in relation to the human mind, ideals still possess a certain kind of metaphysical independence according to Plato.<ref name=nicholas/>\n\n===Historical development and recent analysis===\n[[Image:Gerome - Diogenes.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ancient cynicism|Ancient cynics]] such as [[Diogenes]] dismissed [[Optimism|optimistic]] views of [[human nature]] as baseless given common brutality, with the moral ideals of the time receiving skepticism as he sought his own internal compass.<ref name=cynic/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the wider context of [[ethics]], the very terms 'ethical' and 'ideal' have been inherently tied. Philosopher [[Rushworth Kidder]] has stated that \"standard definitions of ethics have typically included such phrases as 'the science of the ideal human character'\".<ref name=kai/> Thus, ideals have been the topic of discussion and debate since the beginnings of organized human [[civilization]]. The types of ideals dealt with during the [[history of philosophy]] have varied widely over the many centuries, many conceptions existing of what moral idealism actually is and how it gets applied in actual life experiences.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nFrom [[Ancient history|the far distant history]] to today, multiple philosophers have remarked that human beings appear to, by instinct, behave in a matter with few if any ideals and even general morals of whatever kind. The works of [[United Kingdom|British]] thinker [[David Hume]], for instance, explicitly declared people to be inherent \"[[Slavery|slaves]]\" to their passions.<ref name=kant/> When articulating a particularly nuanced theory of morality, Hume's writings labeled it folly to emphasize what people hopefully wish to achieve and additionally argued that enforcing ideals without proper grounding in practical, already existing mores undermines society itself.<ref>{{citenews|journal=[[The Nation (journal)|The Nation]]|accessdate=April 7, 2020|title=Hume's Call to Action|authorlink=Richard Bourke (academic)|date=April 20, 2016|first=Richard|last=Bourke|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/humes-call-to-action/}}</ref>\n\n[[Ancient cynicism|Cynics of the ancient world]] frequently referred to humanity in general as not only not perfectible but fundamentally depraved. The historical [[Greece|Greek]] figure of [[Diogenes]], while arguing that some individuals could through great effort achieve some kind of a moral dignity, was a prominent example in his dismissal of the values common in his day. He sought his own path based on a particular set of ideals that involved begging on the streets, living in a barrel, and wearing rags.<ref name=cynic>{{citeweb|url=https://academyofideas.com/2013/05/diogenes-the-cynic/|title=Diogenes the Cynic|accessdate=April 6, 2020|date=May 26, 2013|website=[[AcademyofIdeas.com]]}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Sermon-on-the-mount-tiffany.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Sermon on the Mount]] has constituted a key moment in the development of [[Christian ethics]] and the sense of idealism embodied within that school of thought.{{fact|date=April 2020}}]]\n\nIn both [[Jewish ethics]] and later [[Christian ethics]], however, advocacy for a stridently idealistic view of the world, in which principles get held over personal convenience and even otherwise perfectly logical expectations, has attracted praise. [[Golden rule]] based moral standards have involved restrictions such as holding back the quest for [[Vengeance (concept)|vengeance]] by the wronged such that punishment only gets applied in a limited, specific fashion, this example being later evaluated as the [[tit-for-tat]] strategy in [[game theory]]. In terms of [[Christianity]], the teachings of the [[Gospels]] and particularly the setting forth of clear-cut principles on the [[Sermon on the Mount]] have constituted an extension of the golden rule; individuals, under [[Jesus Christ|Jesus']] exhortations, have gotten called to hold to the ideal of treating other people even better than they rationally expect to be treated back. Specific phrases such as \"[[turn the other cheek]]\" have come about in terms of moral instruction to effectively convey this idealism.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nWhile [[Western world|Western nations]] have widely retained these influences, in practical terms a great many powerful rulers and prominent thinkers since the [[fall of the Roman Empire]] have pushed back on higher notions of idealistic ethics. Many have done so based on little other than expediency. However, whether explicitly in words or implicitly through deeds, more cynical figures have counter-argued from points of view that can broadly be labeled as \"[[moral relativism]]\". As the arguments have gone, human beings have been little more than crude matter and cannot reasonably be held to act based in any sort of larger principle; survival has remained people's core instinct such that civilization, through relativist eyes, functions as a thin veneer over base instincts.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nMultiple philosophers have argued in favor of particular types of idealism as well for years. The course of the \"[[Age of Enlightenment]]\" from the 17th to the 19th centuries, being a movement that in large part centered around the application of rationality-based principles such as the [[scientific method]] upon [[human nature]], caused increased interest in ethical philosophy as a field of study. Notions of \"benevolence\" attracted widespread attention in terms of [[Government|governance]], with leaders exhorted to act based on idealistic principles and to particularly champion causes such as the facilitating of [[the arts]], increased [[Education|educational efforts]], effective stewardship of [[national resources]], and so on. This movement increased trends away from [[absolute monarchy]] and [[dictatorship]] towards that of [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[Republic|republican government]]. The scientifically based, forward thinking viewpoint about human nature when applied to socio-political organization became later known as \"[[classical liberalism]]\".{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[File:Locke-John-LOC.jpg|thumb|right|Philosopher [[John Locke]], a prominent figure of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment era]], articulated a vision of the individual and collective pursuit of ideals arising from the logical study and analysis of the state of nature.<ref name=kant/>]]\n\nIn terms of broader discussions on ethics, many classical Enlightenment thinkers such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[John Locke]] have famously argued that strong moral standards on individual choice exist based upon standards of [[rationality]] that can be found through [[Logic|logical analysis]] by reasonable observers. Specifically, instrumental principles based on satisfying one\u2019s desires made up the basis for morality through Hobbes' approach. External principles existing in the discoverable state of nature outside of human experience that became possible to tease out due to personal study constituted Locke's theoretical background for ideals and broader ethics.<ref name=kant>{{citeweb|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/|title=Kant\u2019s Moral Philosophy|accessdate=April 8, 2020|publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|date=July 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith respect to social order, Locke's highly influential writings applied rational principles to governance in support of the doctrine of [[social contract theory]], which permeated Enlightenment discussions about the best form of organizing a country. Locke's works such as the ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'' set forth an ethical framework in which rational individuals establish a government in order to guarantee their fundamental rights and possess the understanding that they not only can but should alter said government when rational application of the fair-minded \"[[rule of law]]\" has broken down, change taking place when [[liberty]] no longer receives protection. Locke criticized competing theories such as the [[divine right of kings]], which the thinker viewed as folly.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn terms of individual thinking on principles, Lockean morality has emphasized holding to prominent ideals about human behavior, a particular one being the power of education. Locke wrote of its importance in depth within the pages of ''[[Some Thoughts Concerning Education]]''. Outlining the best way to rear children in his eyes, Lockean arguments stressed that virtuous actions by adults arose as a direct result of the habits of body and mind taught during youth by forward thinking instructors.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nLocke wrote in his work ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' dividing rational understanding into three inherent areas of scope, the philosopher defining the second as \"practica\" and describing it as,\n{{quote|\"The skill of right applying our own powers and actions, for the attainment of things good and useful. The most considerable... is ethics, which is the seeking out those rules and measures of human actions, which lead to happiness, and the means to practise them. The end of this is not bare speculation and the knowledge of truth; but right, and a conduct suitable to it.\"<ref>John Locke. ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''. Chapter XXI. ''Of the Division of the Sciences''.</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Immanuel_Kant_3.jpg|thumb|right|Thinker [[Immanuel Kant]]'s views on idealistic morality aligned the human ethical experience with that of rationality and the greater world,<ref name=frederick/> the philosopher seeing the defiance of ideals such as his \"[[categorical imperative]]\" concept as not only being wrong on principle but also illogical.<ref name=kant/>]]\n\n[[Germany|German]] philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]'s particular view of [[human nature]] and intellectual inquiry, later summed up under the banner of \"[[Kantianism]]\", stressed the inherent power of logical thinking in terms of moral analysis. Kant's advocacy for the \"[[categorical imperative]]\", a doctrine through which every individual choice has to be made with the consideration of the decider that it ought to be a universally held maxim, took place in the broader context of his metaphysical views. In Kant's writings, defiance of higher idealistic principles was not only wrong in a practical sense but in a fundamentally rational and thus moral sense as well.<ref name=kant/>\n\nWorks authored by Kant on the topic include the initial publication ''[[The Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals]]'' followed by ''[[The Critique of Practical Reason]]'', ''[[The Metaphysics of Morals]]'', ''[[Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View]]'', ''[[Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason]]'', the latter commentaries developing the intellectual figure's thinking.<ref name=kant/> Within the pages of ''Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View'' in particular, the philosopher articulated a vision of people as by their very essence driven by meaningful ethics. Through the lens of Kant's doctrine, no ironclad divide has existed between morality and the [[Nature|natural world]], with empirical analysis of human [[psychology]] dovetailing with studies of people's ideals.<ref name=frederick/>\n\nSumming up Kant's views on ideals in context, scholar Frederick P. Van De Pitte has written,\n{{quote|\"Kant realized that man's rational capacity alone is not sufficient to constitute his dignity and elevate him above the brutes. If reason only enables him to do for himself what instinct does for the animal, then it would indicate for man no higher aim or destiny than that of the brute but only a different way of attaining the same end. However, reason is man's most essential attribute because it is the means by which a truly distinctive dimension is made possible for him. Reason, that is, reflective awareness, makes it possible to distinguish between good and bad, and thus morality can be made the ruling purpose of life. Because man can consider an array of possibilities, and which among them is the most desirable, he can strive to make himself and his world into a realization of his ideals.\"<ref name=anthropology/>}}\n\nModern Western philosophy in terms of its discussion of ideals largely takes place within the framework of Enlightenment thinking, with figures such as the aforementioned Hobbes, Kant, and Locke dominating debate. As per the [[United Nations Declaration of Human Rights]], itself an evolution from the earlier [[American Declaration of Independence]] and the [[Constitution of the United States]], many theorizing academics of the 19th century and the 20th century have set forth an [[Optimism|optimistic]] view of humanity. Through this moralistic lens, all individuals by nature of their mere existence have been thought to have been born inherently [[Good and evil|good]], inherently [[Social equality|equal]], and inherently [[Freedom|free]].{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nA defining inflection point of this trend has been the experience of [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]]. The historical memory has been argued to have created a sort of dualistic approach to [[ideology]] in which [[Capitalism|capitalistic]] [[democracy]], centered around classical liberalism, gets inherently pitted forever in struggle with [[Tyranny|tyrannies]], centered around the [[Social stratification|stratification of various groups over others]] and mass misery. In the aftermath of the end of the [[Cold War]], studies upon moral idealism have often asked if Enlightenment viewpoints face an inherent intellectual challenge that the doctrines cannot eventually overcome.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nWith the advent of the 21st century, philosophizers have debated the rapid evolution of different cultures, particularly given advancing technology, and the seeming acceptance of [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian values]] previously thought of as radical or undesirable by [[Center-left politics|center-left]], [[Political moderation|moderate]], and [[Center-right politics|center-right]] individuals. The conflict between these people, many of them belonging to younger generations such as the [[Millennials]], and those [[Political extremism|political extremists]] of the [[Far-right politics|global far-right movement]], the social trend often called \"[[Neo-nationalism|new nationalism]]\", has defined new distinctions between what it means to be a \"moral idealist\". As well, the question of the fundamental [[Biology|biological]] advancement of humanity itself has attracted much attention. What a [[transhuman]] or even [[posthuman]] individual would possess terms of ideals in contrast with regular human beings has remained an open question.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the broadest sense, the question of whether or not humanity as a whole has fundamentally progressed towards a set of moral ideals over time has never achieved any particular consensus. Examples of philosophers who argue partially in support of the notion include the American thinker [[Richard Rorty]], a figure who has criticized the very concept of unchanging ethical principles set forth in inherent nature while still lauding general social progress.<ref name=rorty/> In contrast, multiple scholars concerned with issues such as [[global climate change]] and potential use of [[weapons of mass destruction]] in future [[warfare]] have lamented particular [[Technology|technological advancements]] and related alterations in broader social culture, the thinkers arguing that fundamental moral progress has truly not occurred given forms of increasing danger to humanity.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nOne optimistic view arising in the 20th century and continuing to receive notice is that of prominent [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] figure [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]]. He famously predicted that humanity will eventually advance in terms of not just scientific development through natural and engineered [[biological evolution]] but also idealistic morality to a sort of final oneness regarded by him as the '[[Omega Point]]', a mode of existence taking place not only without hatred, pain, and misery but with perfect collective action and consciousness. Known as the \"Catholic Darwin\", his view of evolutionary advancement came out of a religious context through which he identified humanity's final state with Jesus Christ as the \"[[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]]\" or sacred \"Word\". To Chardin, the power of [[love]] has constituted a sort of elemental drive as strong as that of [[Combustion|fire]] and other natural forces.<ref name=allen/><ref name=langan>{{citenews|date=May 20, 2018|title=Commentary: The Royal Wedding and Jesuit Priest & Philosopher Teilard de Chardin|url=https://www.nbc-2.com/story/38232094/commentary-the-royal-wedding-and-jesuit-priest-philosopher-teilard-de-chardin|first=Michael D.|last=Langan|periodical=[[NBC-2.com]]|accessdate=April 9, 2020}}</ref><ref name=salem/> A [[Geology|geologist]], [[Palentology|paleontologist]], and [[Jesuit]] priest, Chardin was later described by a ''Cyclopedia of World Authors'' volume as having \"combined his scientific beliefs and Christian convictions in an idealistic [and] evolutionary vision of the universe.\"<ref name=salem>{{citebook|pages=1984|date=1997|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6moYAAAAIAAJ|title=Cyclopedia of World Authors, Volume 5|ISBN=9780893564346|publisher=[[Salem Press]]|editor=Magill, Frank N.}}</ref>\n\n[[Pope Benedict XVI]] notably made an approving reference to Chardin's views within a reflection on the [[Epistle to the Romans]] during a [[vespers]] service in [[Aosta Cathedral]], the Pope asserting before the audience,\n{{quote|\"It's the great vision that later Teilhard de Chardin... had: At the end we will have a true cosmic liturgy, where the cosmos becomes a living host.

In some theories of applied ethics, relative importance has gotten assigned to certain social preferences over others as a way to [[Dispute resolution|resolve disputes effectively]]. In analysis of [[legal theory]], for instance, [[judge]]s have been sometimes called on to resolve the balance between the ideal of [[truth]], which would likely advise hearing out all evidence, and the ideal of broader [[social equality]], which would likely advise seeking to restore goodwill between individuals regardless of specific findings during a particular case. Said judges have also been required to consider the principle of the [[right to a speedy trial]] as well, which places limits on the previous two ideals given the time involved in ferreting out details.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn an August 2005 address, philosopher [[Richard Rorty]] remarked upon the \"moral idealism common to Platonism, Judaism, and Christianity\" and the related notion of strictly specified principles through the lens of applied ethics, asserting to a group of business professionals,\n{{quote|\"[I]ndividuals become aware of more alternatives, and therefore wiser, as they grow older.

Specifically, certain authors known as \"[[New atheism|new atheists]]\" such as [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Christopher Hitchens]] have argued that newly emerging forms of [[secular ethics]] constitute an approach of people treating each other that is more logical, just, and reasonable when seen as a rejoinder to previous forms of \"traditional values\". At the same time, multiple thinkers have advocated for moral relativism and a reduced or non-existent sense of holding to previously well-promoted ideals as a direct result of their wholesale rejection of religion. As well, scholars regardless of personal faith background have commented about the complex nature of ethics when taken from spiritual movements.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Idealistic appeals in practice==\n===In conceptual and historical politics===\n\n[[File:Pericles.jpg|thumb|right|Greek statesman [[Pericles]]' vision of [[Athenian democracy]] stressed a sense of what he saw as core ideals, particularly the intelligence and tolerance displayed by Athenians.<ref name=pericles/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nIdeals have played a role in [[politics]] for [[millennia]]. For example, iconic Greek statesman [[Pericles]] famously presented an ideal-based view of the [[Mediterranean]] world. In 431, shortly after the [[Peloponnesian War]] had started, Pericles' \"Funeral Oration\" made to commemorate fallen soldiers, described for posterity by the historian [[Thucydides]], presented a view of [[Athens]] and the city-state's broader civilization that emphasized a sense of cleverness and open-mindedness that Pericles believed gave it the strength to rise to different challenges.<ref name=pericles>{{citenews|journal=[[Pbs.org]]|url=https://www.pbs.org/empires/thegreeks/background/36.html|title=Pericles Funeral Oration in Depth|accessdate=April 5, 2020}}</ref> Other early historical figures known for appealing to ethical ideals in their [[Public speaking|oratory]] include Roman statesman [[Cato the Elder]], the figure's commentary on [[Hellenic Greece|Hellenized]] values leading to his moral appeal among supporters. In contrast to what he saw as [[decadence]] spreading into [[Rome]] and nearby areas from elsewhere, Cato articulated support for what he labeled as traditional Roman ethics.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nMost [[Revolution|political revolutions]] have drawn support from the mass appeal of a certain moral idealism in contrast to the doctrines of those holding [[Power (sociology)|power]], having the various grievances with the status quo created from real or perceived misrule spark ethical debate. During the [[French Revolution]], the rhetorical principles of ''\"[[Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9]]\"'' (English: ''\"Liberty, Equality, Brotherhood\"'') got raised to the status of clear-cut ideals; the new [[nation state]] constituted a sort of grand experiment in what became in de facto and later de jure a new religion. Many political movements in modern times have centered themselves upon multiple ideals found to be mutually reinforcing. Recent examples have included the [[peace movement]] and the broader opposition expressed worldwide to war in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]] as well as elsewhere.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn many cases current and historical, instances have popped up in which proclaimed ideals simply weren't lived up to by various figures while in office, despite claims made by the officials before taking power and since attaining it. In [[British English]], politicians openly changing their opinions in defiance of previous assertions about their ethics have been labeled as making a \"u-turn\". In [[American English]], similar individuals have been pejoratively called \"flip-floppers\". While different, the terms [[U-turn (politics)|have meant the same thing]].{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIdealism in the context of politics has attracted criticism from multiple fronts. For instance, U.S. philosopher [[Gerald Gaus]], the author of ''[[The Tyranny of the Ideal: Justice in a Diverse Society]]'', has prominently argued that an overriding emphasis on ideals causes individuals to wish for impossible political perfection and thus lose their sense of what constituents practical policy advocacy as well as logical choices during [[Election|elections]]. Gaus has made other warnings such as cautioning that people can lose their sense of how much has already been achieved and how well current situations have become in certain circumstances.

In [[Islam]], for instance, the life of the prophet [[Muhammad]] has been held up as a comprehensive ideal for Muslims to study. However, all of his words and deeds must be interpreted for believers through the lens of his life's broader path and the larger religious context, according to Islamic scholars.

Examples of studied categorizations include [[age]], [[ethnicity]], [[gender identity]], [[nationality]], and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]].

Specifically, a 2018 article published by the ''International Journal of Management Science and Business Administration'' stated that six scholarly studies published in the past had determined that women value ethical principles at a higher level than men in the context of [[business]] and [[economics]]. However, some of those had found only modest differences. As well, four published reports in the past had failed to detect any significant differences between the sexes.<ref name=poor>{{citejournal|title=Comparative Business Ethics \u2013 Idealism and Relativism in Light of Empirical Researches in Eight CEE Countries, Finland, and Turkey|journal=International Journal of Management Science and Business Administration|volume=4|issue=5|date=July 2018|pages=23-33|accessdate=April 11, 2020|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.18775/ijmsba.1849-5664-5419.2014.45.1003|author=Po\u00f3r, J\u00f3zsef, et al.}}</ref>\n\nThe aforementioned article evaluated distinctions in [[nationality]] and determined that significant differences exist between the various peoples when it comes to idealism in the working environment. In depth, the analysis of eight different European nations, constituting of [[Croatia]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Hungary]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Poland]], appeared to the researchers to have illustrated the effects of contrasting social mores. For example, [[Culture of Croatia|Croatian culture]] faced the problem that \"[t]he significant majority of employees are satisfied with the minimum level of ethical behavior\" while the Finns were labeled as living in a \"traditionally seen... corruption-free or low-corruption and transparent country\".<ref name=poor/>\n\nIn contrast to only finding slight differences in terms of idealism by sex, the study concluded that particular gaps exist between [[Human generation|generations]]; broadly speaking, the older an individual was, the more importance they gave to idealistic ethics.<ref name=poor/>\n\n===Ideals versus absolute or conditional obligations===\n\n[[File:Blood test (1).jpg|thumb|right|Obligated social standards, such as the various [[Social norms|norms]] around the [[Doctor\u2013patient relationship|medical professional and patient relationship]], have been argued by thinkers as existing at a different plane than idealistic moral views.<ref name=norbert/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nPhilosopher [[Norbert Paulo]] has stated that, in common life, ideals as such appear to exist in relation to general social obligations. Many of the latter concepts have tended to appear, according to Paulo, absolute and essentially mandatory while also existing in highly particular circumstances. For instance, Paulo has written, [[Physician|physicians]] and [[Nursing|nurses]] face a variety of [[Doctor\u2013patient relationship|ethical obligations imposed on them when treating their patients]] that regular individuals encountering said patients randomly do not. He had added that a continuum exists between clear-cut, widely held obligations applied via [[Social norm|social norms]] and vague ones only partially behold to cultural sanction.<ref name=norbert/>\n\nPaulo's argument, thus, has concluded that idealist behavior takes place at a behavioral and mental level above and beyond mere social rules, such actions being \"warranted\" yet \"not strictly required\" either while their optional nature sets them up as being \"praiseworthy\". Ideals represent a method of putting into action an individual's [[personal character]] and its given traits such that, Paulo has argued, moral standards get fleshed out beyond the rigid framework of mere obligations. One person's altruistic caring for another generally has constituted a particular example.<ref name=norbert/>\n\n===Ideals versus virtues===\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe line between an ideal and a [[virtue]] has been difficult to access. Ideals have been argued to inherently involve aspirations while virtues function as direct guides for assigned conduct given social standards.<ref name=norbert/> Analysis has run into problems given that both entities are [[fuzzy concept]]s. In general, some philosophers have argued that an ideal usually constitutes something more inherent that one can make a [[Habituation|habit]] while virtues, instead, necessarily involve going above and beyond regular decision making in order to actively strive for something. Thus, these thinkers have stated, virtues inherently constitute a behavior that's by its very nature highly difficult to turn into a regular practice. Other philosophers have made the exact opposite argument and seen virtues as fundamentally philosophically weaker entities than ideals.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nGiven the complexity of putting ideals into practice, not to mention resolving conflicts between them, many individuals have chosen to narrowly pick a certain group of them and then harden them into absolute [[dogma]]. Political theorist [[Bernard Crick]] has stated that a way to solve this [[dilemma]] is to have ideals that themselves are descriptive of a generalized process rather than a specific outcome, particularly when the latter is hard to achieve.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nKant wrote in his work ''Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View'' pitting idealism against the enactment of personal [[vice]], the philospher arguing,\n{{quote|\"Young man! Deny yourself satisfaction (of amusement, of debauchery, of love, etc.), not with the Stoical intention of complete abstinence, but with the refined Epicurean intention of having in view an ever-growing pleasure. This stinginess with the cash of your vital urge makes you definitely richer through the postponement of pleasure, even if you should, for the most part, renounce the indulgence of it until the end of your life. The awareness of having pleasure under your control is, like everything idealistic, more fruitful and more abundant than everything that satisfies the sense through indulgence because it is thereby simultaneously consumed and consequently lost from the aggregate of totality.\"<ref name=anthropology>{{citebook|title=[[Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View]]|authorlink=Immanuel Kant|first=Immanuel|last=Kant|date=1996|translator=Victor Lyle Dowdell|publisher=[[Southern Illinois University Press]]|ISBN=9780809320608}}</ref>}}\n\n===Relative ideals===\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[Robert S. Hartman]] has contended that since, colloquially, labeling an entity as ideal means that something is the best member of the set of all things of that class, thus the term has particular implications when used in an ethical context. For example, he has stated, the ideal student constitutes the best member of the set of all students in exactly the same way that the ideal circle is the best circle that can be imagined of the class of all circles. Since one can define the properties that the ideal member of a class should have, according to Hartman, the value of any actual object can be empirically determined by comparing it to the ideal. The closer an object's actual properties match up to the properties of the ideal, the better the object is to Hartman. Thus, a bumpy circle drawn in the sand is worse than a very smooth one drawn with a compass' aid, but both are better than a regularly made square.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nFor Hartman, the world in general has presented a situation in which each particular entity ought usually to become more like its ideal if possible. This entails that, in [[ethics]], each individual should analogously to become more like the hypothetical ideal person, and a person's morality can actually be measured by examining how close they live up to their ideal self, in Hartman's view.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Totalizing ideals versus emergent ideals===\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\nThe question of to what extent one can hold to certain ideals practically and how facing resistance will shape them has attracted debate from multiple thinkers. The related issue of to what extent idealistic morality held by individuals reflects broader cultures has done so as well. The extent to which human beings think through their behavior irrationally or rationally has been a major issue in these such discussions.<ref name=kelly/><ref name=terry/>\n\nOne 21st century philosopher who has delved into the topics is [[Terry Eagleton]]. Writing in his book ''After Theory'', he has commented critically about the practicality of ethical idealism, Eagleton arguing,\n{{quote|\"Moral values which state what you ought to do are impressively idealistic, but too blatantly at odds with your behaviour. Moral values\nwhich reflect what you actually do are far more plausible, but only at the cost of no longer serving to legitimate your activity.\"<ref name=terry>{{citebook|date=2004|authorlink=Terry Eagleton||title=After Theory|publisher=[[Penguin Publishing]]|pages=151-152|ISBN=9780141927886|first=Terry|last=Eagleton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T3N6zL1qyHQC}}</ref>}}\n\nAnother 21st century philosopher who has questioned traditional understandings of idealistic morality is [[Kwame Anthony Appiah]]. In particular, his book ''As If: Idealization and Ideals'' examined the usefulness of the concepts and the processes through which they've been articulated. Appiah found fault in the general assumptions made by certain thinkers of human rationality and advocated for a larger understanding of the practical nature of the idealization process among scholars of multiple disciplines as well as laypeople.<ref name=kelly/>\n\nIn depth, Appiah's book presented a nuanced picture of ethical idealism in the context of cultural organization, the philosopher writing,\n{{quote|\"The history of our collective moral learning doesn't start with the growing acceptance of a picture of an ideal society. It starts with the rejection of some current practice or structure, which we come to see as wrong.
