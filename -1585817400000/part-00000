Immediately following the explosion of Gerboise Verte (which yielded <1 kiloton), soldiers were sent within a 1&nbsp;km radius of the explosion site, where they practiced combat exercises and drove tanks around the area.

In 2011, it was a part of the [[Intercontinental Le Mans Cup]].

The [[American Le Mans Series]] and Europe's [[Le Mans Series]] of multi-event sports car championships were spun off from 24 Hours of Le Mans regulations. Other races include the [[Le Mans Classic]], a race for historic Le Mans race cars from years past held on the Circuit de la Sarthe, a [[24 Hours of Le Mans (motorcycle race)|motorcycle version of the race]] which is held on the shortened Bugatti version of the same circuit, a kart race (24 Heures Karting), a truck race (24 Heures Camions), and a parody race [[24 Hours of LeMons]].\n\n==Purpose==\nLaunched when [[Grand Prix motor racing]] was the dominant form of motorsport throughout Europe, Le Mans was designed to present a different test. Instead of focusing on the ability of a car company to build the fastest machines, the 24 Hours of Le Mans would instead concentrate on the ability of manufacturers to build sporty yet reliable cars. This encouraged innovation in producing reliable and [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel-efficient vehicles]], because [[Endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance racing]] requires cars that last and spend as little time in the pits as possible.\n\nAt the same time, the layout of the track necessitated cars with better aerodynamics and stability at high speeds. While this was shared with Grand Prix racing, few tracks in Europe had straights of a length comparable to the [[Mulsanne Straight|Mulsanne]]. Additionally, because the road is public and thus not as meticulously maintained as permanent racing circuits, racing puts more strain on the parts, increasing the importance of reliability.\n\nThe [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]] in the early 1970s led organizers to adopt a fuel economy formula known as [[Group C]] that limited the amount of fuel each car was allowed. Although it was later abandoned, fuel economy remains important as new fuel sources reduce time spent during pit stops. Such technological innovations have had a trickle-down effect and can be incorporated into consumer cars. This has also led to faster and more exotic [[supercar]]s as manufacturers seek to develop faster road cars in order to develop them into even faster GT cars.\n\nAdditionally, in recent years hybrid systems (flywheel, super-capacitor, battery coupled with both gasoline and diesel) have been championed in the LMP category as rules have been changed to their benefit and to further push efficiency.\n\n==Race==\n[[File:Le Mans Race Control.jpg|thumb|The [[Pit stop|pits]] at day]]\nThe race is held in June, leading at times to very hot conditions for drivers, particularly in closed vehicles with poor ventilation; rain is commonly seen.

Current regulations mandate that three drivers share each competing vehicle.\n\nCompeting teams race in groups called \"classes\", or cars of similar specification, while also competing simultaneously for outright placing amongst all classes. Originally, the race showcased cars as they were sold to the general public, then called \"Sports Cars\", in contrast with the specialised [[race car|racing cars]] used in [[Grand Prix motor racing]]. Over time, the competing vehicles evolved away from their publicly available road car roots, and today the race is made of two overall classes: prototypes, and Grand Touring cars (similar to sports cars sold to the public).  These are further broken down into 2 sub-classes each,  constructors' prototypes, privateer prototypes and 2 subclasses of GT cars.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lemans.org/en/races/24h/discover-endurance/introduction.html | title=Two major car families | publisher=lemans.org | accessdate=22 April 2011 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807090320/http://www.lemans.org/en/races/24h/discover-endurance/introduction.html | archivedate=7 August 2011 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[Image:LeMans PitStop2.JPG|thumb|The pits at dawn|223x223px|alt=]]Competing teams have had a wide variety of organization, ranging from competition departments of road car manufacturers (eager to prove the supremacy of their products) to professional motor racing teams (representing their commercial backers, some of which are also car manufacturers who want to win without paying for their own teams) to amateur teams (racing as much to compete in the famous race as to claim victory for their commercial partners).\n[[File:Le Mans Pits at Night.jpg|thumb|The pits at night]]\nThe race has also spent long periods as a round of the [[World Sportscar Championship]], although Le Mans has always had a stronger reputation than the World Championship, and is a round of the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]]. The race is also known as a leg of the informal [[Triple Crown of Motorsport]] which links [[Formula One]], [[IndyCar]], and [[sports car racing]] to represent a career achievement for drivers. Additionally, it is seen as a leg of the [[Triple Crown (endurance racing)|Triple Crown of endurance racing]], which links the three largest sports car races together, with [[12 Hours of Sebring]] and [[24 Hours of Daytona]] forming the other legs.  Since 1998, the American Le Mans Series (now the [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]] [[United SportsCar Championship|Weathertech Sports Car Championship]]) holds an endurance race, along with the 12 hours of Sebring, every year called \"[[Petit Le Mans]]\", as a 10-hour American version. In 2014, the [[United SportsCar Championship|Weathertech Sports Car Championship]] (a merger of the races at Sebring; [[Petit Le Mans]] in [[Braselton]], Georgia; the [[6 Hours of Watkins Glen]] in [[Watkins Glen, New York|Watkins Glen]], New York; and the [[Rolex Sports Car Series]]' [[24 Hours of Daytona]]) held all four major American endurance classics in preparation for teams to race at [[Le Mans]].\n\n===Cars===\n[[File:GT's_Climbing_up_the_hill_to_the_Dunlop_Bridge_(48126931781).jpg|thumb|GT cars approaching Dunlop Bridge|alt=|left]]\nThe race has approximately 60 competitors. Each car was required to have at least two seats, but recently cars only need the ability to accommodate a second seat in the cockpit rather than the seat itself. No more than two doors are allowed; open cockpit cars do not require doors. Since 2014, all cars in the premier LMP1 category must have a roof due to safety concerns, with open-cockpit cars only permitted in the slightly slower LMP2 category. Since 2017, all prototype cars, LMP1 or LMP2, must have closed cockpits.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://auto-racing.speedtv.com/article/le-mans-inside-the-2014-lmp1-regulations/ |title=LE MANS: Inside The 2014 LMP1 Regulations |publisher=Auto-racing.speedtv.com |date=2012-11-27 |accessdate=2013-08-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130710021103/http://auto-racing.speedtv.com/article/le-mans-inside-the-2014-lmp1-regulations |archivedate=10 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAlthough all cars compete at the same time, there are separate classes. A prize is awarded to the winner of each class, and to the overall winner. The number of classes has varied over the years, but there are now four. Custom-built [[Le Mans Prototype]]s (LMP) are the top two classes, LMP1 and LMP2, divided by speed, weight, and power output. \n\nFor LMP2, teams are obliged to run one of four approved chassis \u2013 ORECA, Ligier, Dallara or Multimatic/Riley \u2013 mated with a standard 4.2-litre Gibson V8 engine. LMP1 teams are subject to no such restrictions, however, and their extra power, lower weight and more complex aerodynamics results in much quicker lap times; LMP1 cars are also permitted to use hybrid technology <ref>https://www.fiawec.com/en/news/differences-between-lmp1-and-lmp2/5907#:~:targetText=While%20LMP1%20is%20a%20category,teams%20with%20a%20lower%20budget.</ref>\n\nFrom 2011, the next two classes are production-based [[grand tourer]] (GT) classes, GT Endurance Pro and GT Endurance AM. Both of these classes use the [[LM GTE]], or \"Le Mans Grand Touring Endurance\" regulations. Although the top class is the most likely to be the overall winner, lower classes have won on occasion due to better reliability.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n===Drivers===\n[[File:United autosports le mans 2018 tuesday-01 (28896068288).jpg|thumb|left|Drivers photograph from 2018]]\nOriginally, there were no rules on the number of drivers of a car, or how long they could drive. Although almost all teams used two drivers in the early decades, some Le Mans drivers such as [[Pierre Levegh]] and [[E.R. Hall|Eddie Hall]] attempted to run the race solo, hoping to save time by not having to change drivers. This practice was later banned. Until the 1980s, there were teams in which only two drivers competed, but by the end of the decade, the rules were changed to stipulate that at least three drivers must drive each car.\n\nBy the 1990s, due to the speeds of the cars and the strain it puts on drivers, additional rules to reduce driver fatigue mandated that drivers could not drive for over 240 minutes over a 6-hour period, and that no one driver could run for over 14 hours total. With careful management of driver stints, this makes it possible to complete the race with only two drivers (as [[Jeroen Bleekemolen]] and Cooper MacNeil did in 2014), although the vast majority of teams still continue to use three drivers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.24h-lemans.com/en/race/historical_2_2_2501.html?recherche=1&annee=2014&nbparpage=9#topContent|title=ACO \u2013 Automobile Club de l'Ouest|website=www.24h-lemans.com|accessdate=8 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racer.com/wec-le-mans/item/104435-lm24-iron-man-rotation-for-macneil-and-bleekemolen|title=Iron Man Rotation for Macneil and Bleekemolen|work=www.racer.com|access-date=8 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617003459/http://www.racer.com/wec-le-mans/item/104435-lm24-iron-man-rotation-for-macneil-and-bleekemolen|archive-date=17 June 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, the driving time rules were further changed. If necessary, officials may require a drive time limit of 80 minutes of consecutive time behind the wheel, and a minimum 30 minute rest break.  The rule applies only if the air temperature is at least 32 Celsius (89.6 F).<ref>[https://www.fiawec.com/en/news/an-eye-on-the-clock/5136]</ref>\n\n===Traditions and unique rules===\n[[File:United-autosports-le-mans-2018-169 (41048826150).jpg|thumb|Fly-over with the tricolor]]\n[[File:Lemans-20100613-final.jpg|thumb|Marshals waving safety flags to congratulate Audi in 2010 race]]\nAlthough it has been a part of the [[World Sportscar Championship]] for most of its existence, the race has had different regulations for safety and competition reasons partly due to its length. For many decades, cars were required to run at least an hour into the race before they were allowed to refill fluids for the car, such as oil or coolant, with the exception of fuel. This was an attempt by the ACO to help increase efficiency and reliability. Cars which could not last the first hour without having to replace lost fluids were disqualified.\n\nAnother rule unique to Le Mans is that cars must be switched off while they are refuelled in the pits. Not only is this safer and less of a fire hazard, but it is also another test of reliability, as cars with the guaranteed ability to restart many times under race conditions are harder to make. Another element of this rule is that mechanics are not allowed to work on the car while it is being refuelled (other than helping a driver in or out of the car), which has led teams to adapt innovative ways in which to decrease the time of these lengthy pit stops. Drivers are allowed to get out of the car and be replaced by another driver during refuelling. Those rules are also in application in the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]].\n\nThere are various long-standing traditions at Le Mans, including the waving of the [[Flag of France|French tricolor]] to start the race. This is usually followed by a fly-over featuring jets trailing blue, white and red smoke. A similar flag tradition is the waving of safety flags during the final lap of the race by track marshals, congratulating the winners and other finishers.\n\nLe Mans was the venue for the first televised instance of a winning driver celebrating by spraying champagne instead of drinking it.<ref name=\"Miscellany pg 82\">G. Harding ''\"A Wine Miscellany\"'' pg 82, Clarkson Potter Publishing, New York 2005 {{ISBN|0-307-34635-8}}</ref> When [[Dan Gurney]] won the {{24hLM|1967}} race with co-driver [[A. J.

Looking down, he saw Ford CEO [[Henry Ford II]], team owner [[Carroll Shelby]] and their wives, as well as several journalists who had predicted disaster for the high-profile duo. Gurney shook the bottle and sprayed everyone nearby. Gurney autographed and gave the bottle of champagne to ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' photographer Flip Schulke, who used it as a lamp for years before returning it to Gurney.<ref name=\"champagne1\">{{cite journal |url=http://allamericanracers.com/images/pdf/Champagne-Story-Eoin-Young.pdf |title=Dan Gurney's 1967 Champagne Week |last=Young |first=Eoin |authorlink=Eoin Young |journal=Victory Lane |date=November 2013 |pages=42\u201344 |accessdate=21 June 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"champagne2\">{{cite web |url=http://allamericanracers.com/le-mans-champagne-story-dan-gurney/ |title=Spraying the Champagne |publisher=Dan Gurney's All-American Racing |accessdate=21 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Schedule====\n[[File:United-autosports-le-mans-2018-141 (41019577000).jpg|thumb|Driver parade in Le Mans in 2018]]\nThe first race was held on 26\u201327 May 1923 and has since been run annually in June with exceptions in 1956, when the race was held in July; 1968, when it was held in September due to nationwide [[May 1968 events in France|political turmoil in May]] & in 2020, when it was moved to 19\u201320 September due to the [[COVID-19]] outbreak. The race has been cancelled ten times\u2014in 1936 (a labour strike during the [[Great Depression]]) and between 1940 and 1948 (World War II).\n\nThe race usually takes place on the second weekend of June, with qualifying and practice taking place on the Wednesday and Thursday before the race, following a car inspection on Monday and Tuesday. Currently, these sessions are held in the evening, with two separate two-hour sessions held each night. Friday serves as a day of rest and a parade of all the drivers through [[Le Mans]] is held.\n\nTest days held at the end of April or beginning of May served as a pre-qualification weeding out the slowest cars. However, in 2005 the exorbitant cost of transporting cars to and from Le Mans led organizers to move the test day to the first weekend of June. In fact pre-qualification was eliminated in 2000, meaning that all competitors invited to the test would be allowed into the race.\n\nSince 2001 the [[Le Mans Legend]] races have also been part of the schedule, usually running exhibition races during qualifying days, a few hours prior to the sessions for the Le Mans entrants.\n\nUntil 2008, the race started at 16:00 on Saturday (though in 1968, the race started at 14:00 due to the lateness of the race on the calendar). In 1984 and 2007, the start time was moved ahead to 15:00 due to the conflicting [[2007 French presidential election|election]]). In 2006, the ACO scheduled a 17:00 start time on Saturday, 17 June in order to maximise television coverage in between the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] games. Since 2009, when the race took place from 13\u201314 June, it starts at 15:00 local time ([[Central European Summer Time|CEST]], 13:00 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UT]]).\n\n====Classification====\n[[File:Shelby GT40.jpg|thumb|Bruce McLaren and Ken Miles winning car from 1966|alt=|left]]\nOriginally, the car that covered the greatest distance from its starting position was the winner. This is known to have caught out the [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] team in {{24hLM|1966}}. With a dominant 1\u20132 lead, the two cars slowed to allow for a [[photo opportunity]] at the finish line, with [[Ken Miles]] slightly ahead of [[Bruce McLaren]]. However, since McLaren's car had actually started much farther back on the grid than Miles's, McLaren's car had actually covered the greatest distance over the 24 hours. With the margin of victory determined to be eight metres, McLaren and his co-driver, [[Chris Amon]], were declared the winners. The decision cost Miles and [[Denny Hulme]] a victory. Miles had already won the other two endurance races at Sebring and Daytona. With a win at Le Mans, he would have become not only the first man to win all three, but the first to win them all in the same year.\n\nThe \"greatest distance\" rule was modified with the introduction of a rolling start in 1971, and now the car that completes the greatest distance as of the completion of the final lap \u2013 where \"greatest distance\" is measured by the start/finish line for all competitors \u2013 wins. When two cars finish the same number of laps, their finishing order is determined by the faster overall completion time. This rule was used in the [[2011 24 Hours of Le Mans]] to determine the race winner, when the top two finishers both completed 355 laps, with only 13 seconds difference between them.<ref>{{Citation|last=Fredstar88|title=Final Lap of 24 Hours of Le Mans 2011|date=2011-06-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCs8Nvt65uU|accessdate=2016-07-02}}</ref>\n\nAlthough \"greatest distance run\" determines the provisional order of finishers, additional requirements must be met for a car to be classified.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.fiawec.com/presentation/regulation.html|title=Regulation {{!}} FIA World Endurance Championship|website=www.fiawec.com|access-date=2016-07-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702204225/http://www.fiawec.com/presentation/regulation.html|archive-date=2 July 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n* A car must complete the last lap of the race, and must complete the entire circuit faster than a prescribed maximum lap time.  Ambiguity in this classification requirement has led to dramatic scenes where damaged cars have waited in the pits or on the edge of the track close to the finish line, then restarted their engines and crawled across the line to be listed amongst classified finishers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The practice of intentionally \"waiting for the final lap\" in this manner has been prohibited by rule in recent years.\n* Cars must complete 70 percent of the distance covered by the overall winner to be classified. A car failing to complete this number of laps, even if it finishes the last lap of the race, is not deemed worthy of classification because of poor reliability or speed.\nAll classification requirements hold except in exceptional circumstances, as determined by the race stewards.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====Le Mans start====\n{{Further|Standing start}}\n[[Image:Lemans Circuit Bugatti.JPG|thumb|right|The permanent pits and pit straight for both the ''[[Circuit de la Sarthe]]'' and Bugatti Circuit]]\n\nThe race traditionally began with what became known as the ''Le Mans start'', in which cars were lined up along the length of the pits. Until 1962, cars were lined up in order of engine capacity, but beginning in 1963 qualifying times determined the lineup. The starting drivers stood on the opposite side of the front stretch. When the French flag dropped to signify the start, the drivers ran across the track, entered and started their cars without assistance, and drove away. This became a safety issue in the late 1960s when some drivers ignored their safety harnesses, then a recent invention. This led to drivers running the first few laps either improperly harnessed due to attempting to do it while driving or sometimes not even harnessed at all, leading to several deaths when cars were involved in accidents due to the bunched field at the start.\n\nThis starting method inspired [[Porsche]] to locate the ignition key switch to the left of the steering wheel. In a left-hand drive car, this allowed the driver to use his left hand to start the engine, and his right hand to put the [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] into gear, which in turn shaves off a few tenths of a second.[[Image:Le Mans 2008 Rolling start.jpg|thumb|Rolling start of the {{24hLM|2008}} race|alt=|left]]\n\nAnother method for speeding up the start was developed by [[Stirling Moss]]. His car was waiting with first gear already engaged. When he jumped in, he switched the starter on without depressing the clutch. The car was immediately jerked forward by the starter motor, but the engine did not start due to low RPM. After a few seconds of motion, he then pushed the clutch down, allowing the engine to speed up and start while the car was moving.\n\nFeeling this type of start was unsafe, in the {{24hLM|1969}} race, [[Jacky Ickx]] opposed it by walking across the track while his competitors ran. Although he was nearly hit by a faster competitor's car while walking, Ickx took the time to fasten his safety belts before pulling away. Privateer [[John Woolfe]] died in an accident on the first lap of that race; Ickx won.\n\nThe traditional Le Mans start was changed for {{24hLM|1970}}. Cars were still lined up along the pit wall, but the drivers were already inside and strapped in. At the dropping of the French tricolor, the drivers started their engines and drove away. Since 1971, when that method was done away with, a [[rolling start]] (sometimes known as an ''[[Indianapolis 500|Indianapolis]] start'') begins the race.<ref name=\"24 key dates for the 24 Hours\">{{cite web|title=24 key dates for the 24 Hours|url=http://www.lemans.org/en/news/24-key-dates-for-the-24-hours_6843.html|publisher=ACO|accessdate=20 April 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422191720/http://www.lemans.org/en/news/24-key-dates-for-the-24-hours_6843.html|archivedate=22 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Circuit==\n[[Image:Circuit de la Sarthe track map.svg|thumb|right|The [[Circuit de la Sarthe]] with the [[Bugatti Circuit]] (dashed line)]]\n{{Main|Circuit de la Sarthe}}\nThe circuit on which the 24 Hours of Le Mans is run is named the [[Circuit de la Sarthe]], after the [[Departments of France|department]] that Le Mans is within. It consists of both permanent track and public roads that are temporarily closed for the race. Since 1923, the track has been extensively modified, mostly for safety reasons, and now is {{convert|13.626|km|3|abbr=on}} in length. Although it initially entered the town of Le Mans, the track was cut short in order to better protect spectators. This led to the creation of the [[Dunlop Tyres|Dunlop]] Curve and Tertre Rouge corners before rejoining the old circuit on the [[Mulsanne]]. Another major change was on the Mulsanne itself in 1990, when the [[FIA]] decreed that it would no longer sanction any circuit that had a straight longer than {{convert|2|km|1|abbr=on}}. To comply with this, two [[chicanes]] were added to the {{convert|6|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} straight. The addition of the chicanes was further influenced by the fact that the speed of [[Welter Racing|WM P88]]-[[PNV engine|Peugeot]] French driver [[Roger Dorchy]] had been timed at {{convert|405|kph|0|abbr=on}} during the [[1988 24 Hours of Le Mans|1988]] race.\n\nDue to the shorter length of the straights, top speeds at Le Mans are now generally around {{convert|205|mph|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}.\n\nThe public sections of the track differ from the permanent circuit, especially in comparison with the [[Circuit de la Sarthe#Bugatti Circuit|Bugatti Circuit]] which is inside the Circuit de la Sarthe. Due to heavy traffic in the area, the public roads are not as smooth or well kept. They also offer less grip because of the lack of soft-tyre rubber laid down from racing cars, though this only affects the first few laps of the race. The roads are closed only within a few hours of the practice sessions and the race, before being opened again almost as soon as the race is finished. Workers have to assemble and dismantle safety barriers every year for the public sections.\n\n==History==\n:''For a list of individual race reports, see [[:Category:24 Hours of Le Mans races]].''\n\n===1923\u20131939===\n[[Image:1923Lemans.JPG|thumb|A poster for the [[1923 24 Hours of Le Mans]]]]\n\nThe 24 Hours of Le Mans was [[1923 24 Hours of Le Mans|first run on 26 and 27 May 1923]], through public roads around Le Mans. Originally planned to be a three-year event awarded the [[Rudge-Whitworth]] Triennial Cup, with a winner being declared by the car which could go the farthest distance over three consecutive 24-hour races, this idea was abandoned in 1928 and overall winners were declared for each single year depending on who covered the farthest distance by the time 24 hours were up. The early races were dominated by French, British, and Italian drivers, teams, and cars, with [[Bugatti]], [[Bentley]], and [[Alfa Romeo]] being the top brands. Innovations in car design began appearing at the track in the late 1930s, with Bugatti and Alfa Romeo running highly aerodynamic bodywork in order to run down the [[Mulsanne Straight]] at faster speeds. The race was cancelled in 1936 due to [[Matignon Agreements (1936)|general strikes in France]], and the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939 resulted in a ten-year hiatus.\n\n===1949\u20131969===\n[[File:Jaguar Heritage Racing (7151624983).jpg|thumb|left|Jaguar D-Type in 1956]]\nFollowing the reconstruction of circuit facilities, the race was resumed in 1949<ref name=\"24 key dates for the 24 Hours\" /> with renewed interest from major automobile manufacturers. 1949 was also [[Ferrari]]'s first victory, the [[Ferrari 166 S|166MM]] of [[Luigi Chinetti]] and [[Peter Mitchell-Thomson, 2nd Baron Selsdon|Peter Mitchell-Thomson]].<ref name=\"24 key dates for the 24 Hours\" /> After the formation of the [[World Sportscar Championship]] in 1953, of which Le Mans was a part, Ferrari, [[Aston Martin]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]] and many others began sending multiple cars backed by their respective factories to compete for overall wins against their competitors. This competitiveness sometimes resulted in tragedy, as in the [[1955 Le Mans disaster]] during the {{24hLM|1955}} race in which [[Pierre Levegh]]'s car crashed into a crowd of spectators, killing more than 80&nbsp;people. The incident led to the widespread introduction of safety measures, not only at the circuit, but elsewhere in the motorsport world. Following the accident, the entire pit complex was razed and rebuilt further back allowing the pit straight to be widened, although there was still no barrier between the track and the pit lane. Safety standards improved but the cars got faster, and the move from open-cockpit roadsters to closed-cockpit coup\u00e9s resulted in speeds of over {{convert|320|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} on the Mulsanne. Ford entered the picture with the [[Ford GT40|GT40]], finally ending Ferrari's dominance with four straight wins (1966\u20131969) before the 1960s ended and the cars, and the race, changed substantially.\n\n===1970\u20131980===\n[[Image:Renault Alpine A443 Donington 2007.jpg|thumb|right|[[Renault Alpine A443]] from 1978]]\nFor the new decade, the race took a turn towards more extreme speeds and automotive designs. These extreme speeds led to the replacement of the typical standing ''Le Mans start'' with a rolling ''Indianapolis start''. Although production-based cars still raced, they were now in the lower classes while purpose-built sportscars became the norm. The [[Porsche 917]], [[Porsche 935|935]], and [[Porsche 936|936]] were dominant throughout the decade, but a resurgence by French manufacturers [[Equipe Matra Sports|Matra]]-[[Simca]] and [[Renault]] saw the first victories for the nation since the 1950 race. This decade is also remembered for strong performances from many privateer constructors, with two scoring the only victories for a privateer, in the decade. [[John Wyer]]'s [[Mirage (race car)|Mirage]] won in {{24hLM|1975}}, while [[Jean Rondeau]]'s self-titled chassis took {{24hLM|1980}}.\n\n===1981\u20131993===\n[[Image:Porsche 962 1988 Le Mans at Silverstone 2007.JPG|thumb|[[Group C]] [[Porsche 962]] from 1988|alt=|left]]\nThe rest of the 1980s was known for the dominance by Porsche under the new [[Group C]] race car formula that encouraged fuel efficiency. Originally running the effective [[Porsche 956|956]], it was later replaced by the [[Porsche 962|962]]. Both chassis were affordable enough for privateers to purchase them en masse, leading to the two model types winning six years in a row. Jaguar and Mercedes-Benz returned to sports car racing, with Jaguar being the first to break Porsche's dominance with victories in 1988 and 1990 (with the [[XJR-9]] and [[Jaguar XJR-12]] respectively). Mercedes-Benz won in 1989, with what was seen as the latest incarnation of the elegant \"[[Silver Arrows]]\", the [[Sauber C9]], while an influx of Japanese manufacturer interest saw prototypes from [[Nissan]] and Toyota. In 1988 too, a [[Welter Racing|WM]] [[Peugeot]] set up a new record speeding at {{convert|405|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} in the ''Ligne Droite des Hunaudi\u00e8res'', famous for its {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}} long straight.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.24h-lemans.com/en/news/24-hours-of-mans-the-records-to-be-beaten_2_2_1746_11149.html | title=THE RECORDS TO BE BEATEN | publisher=24h-lemans.com | accessdate=11 June 2014 }}</ref> [[Mazda]] would be the first Japanese manufacturer to succeed, with their unique [[Wankel engine|rotary]]-powered [[Mazda 787B|787B]] winning in 1991.\n\n[[File:Peugeot905 evo1ter 1993.jpg|thumb|[[Peugeot 905]] from 1993]]\nIn 1992 and 1993, Peugeot dominated the race with its [[Peugeot 905]] as the Group C formula and [[World Sportscar Championship]] were fading in participation.\n\nThe circuit would also undergo one of its most notable changes in {{24hLM|1990}}, when the 5&nbsp;km long Mulsanne was modified<ref name=\"24 key dates for the 24 Hours\" /> to include two chicanes in order to stop speeds of more than {{Convert|400|km/h|mi/h|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} from being reached. This began a trend by the ACO to attempt to slow the cars on various portions of the track; although speeds over {{Convert|320|km/h|mi/h|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} are still regularly reached at various points on a lap.\n\n===1994\u20131999===\n[[File:Le mans F40 1.jpg|thumb|[[Ferrari F40]] in 1995 race|alt=|left]]\nFollowing the demise of the [[World Sportscar Championship]], Le Mans saw a resurgence of production-based [[grand tourer]] cars. Thanks to a loophole in the rules, Porsche succeeded in convincing the ACO that a [[Dauer 962 Le Mans]] supercar was a production car, allowing Porsche to race their [[Porsche 962]] for one final time, dominating the field. Although the ACO attempted to close the loop hole for 1995, newcomer [[McLaren Cars|McLaren]] would win the race in their supercar's first appearance thanks to the reliability of the BMW V12 powered F1 GTR, beating faster yet more trouble-prone prototypes. The trend would continue through the 1990s as more exotic supercars were built in order to skirt the ACO's rules regarding production-based race cars, leading to [[Porsche]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], Toyota, Nissan, [[Panoz]], and [[Lotus Cars|Lotus]] entering the GT categories. This culminated in the {{24hLM|1999}} event, in which these GT cars were faced with the [[Le Mans Prototype]]s of [[BMW]], [[Audi]], and [[Ferrari]]. BMW would survive with the victory, their first and only overall Le Mans win to date, while Mercedes left sportscar racing indefinitely following three catastrophic though non-fatal crashes stemming from severe aerodynamic flaws with their [[Mercedes-Benz CLR|CLR]].\n\nThis strong manufacturer influence led the ACO to lending the Le Mans name to a sports car series in the United States in 1999, known as the [[American Le Mans Series]], which ran until the end of the [[2013 American Le Mans Series season|2013]] season after which it merged with [[Grand-Am Road Racing|Grand-Am]] to form the [[United SportsCar Championship]].\n\n===2000\u20132005===\n[[File:Audi R8 LMP, Le Mans 2000 (museum mobile 2013-09-03).JPG|thumb|Audi R8]]\n[[File:2003 Bentley Speed 8.jpg|thumb|Bentley Speed 8|alt=|left]]\nMany major automobile manufacturers withdrew from sports car racing after 1999 due to the high cost. Only Cadillac and Audi remained, and Audi easily dominated with the [[Audi R8 (race car)|R8]]. Cadillac pulled out three years later, and attempts by Panoz, [[Chrysler]], and [[MG (car)|MG]] to beat Audi all fell short. After three victories in a row, Audi provided engine, team staff, and drivers to [[Bentley]], a corporate partner, which had returned in 2001, and in 2003 the factory [[Bentley Speed 8]]s beat privateer Audis. The Chevrolet Corvette Racing Team and their C5-R won several times in the GTS class, finishing 1st and 2nd in 2001, 2002, and 2004. They finished 2nd and 3rd in 2003 behind Ferrari.\n\n=== 2006\u20132013 ===\n[[Image:Audi R10 1.JPG|thumb|A [[diesel engine|diesel]]-powered Audi R10 TDI|alt=|left]]\n[[File:24 Hours of Le Mans 2010 - Audi Sport Team Joest 8.jpg|thumb|Audi R15 TDI|alt=|left]]\nAt the end of 2005, after five overall victories for the R8, and six to its V8 turbo engine, Audi took on a new challenge by introducing a [[diesel engine]]d prototype known as the [[Audi R10 TDI|R10 TDI]]. Although not the first diesel to race, it was the first to win at Le Mans. This era saw other alternative fuel sources being used, including [[bio-ethanol]], while Peugeot decided to follow Audi's lead and also pursue a diesel entry in 2007 with their [[Peugeot 908 HDi FAP|908 HDi FAP]].[[File:Peugeot 908 24 Hours Le Mans 2009.jpg|thumb|Peugeot 908 HDi FAP|alt=]]In the [[2008 24 Hours of Le Mans|2008 race]] between the [[Audi R10 TDI]] and the [[Peugeot 908 HDi FAP]], the Audi won by a margin of less than 10 minutes. For the [[2009 24 Hours of Le Mans]], Peugeot introduced a new energy-recovery system similar to the [[Kinetic energy recovery system|KERS]] used in [[Formula One]].<ref>{{cite news|title= 908 HY to close Le Mans Series in hybrid style|publisher=AutoBlog}}</ref> Aston Martin entered the [[LMP1]] category, but still raced in [[FIA GT1 World Championship|GT1]] with private teams. Audi returned with the new R15 TDI, but Peugeot prevailed in its first overall win since 1993.\n\nThe [[2010 24 Hours of Le Mans|2010]] running reaffirmed the race as a test of endurance and reliability. In adjusting their cars and engines to adhere to the 2010 regulations, Peugeot chose overall speed while Audi chose reliability. At the end of the race, all four Peugeots had retired, three due to engine failure, while Audi finished 1\u20132\u20133.\n\nThe [[2011 24 Hours of Le Mans|2011]] and [[2012 24 Hours of Le Mans|2012]] races were marred by a series of accidents. In 2011, in the first hour, the Audi driven by Allan McNish crashed heavily, barrel rolling into a tire wall shortly after the [[Dunlop Bridge]]. At night, the defending race-winning Audi driven by [[Mike Rockenfeller]] crashed in similar fashion between the Mulsanne and Indianapolis corners. Neither driver was injured, nor were any spectators. The third Audi entry driven by [[Marcel F\u00e4ssler (racing driver)|Marcel F\u00e4ssler]], [[Andr\u00e9 Lotterer]], and [[Beno\u00eet Tr\u00e9luyer]] won the race. The 2012 race saw two factory Toyotas replace Peugeot, which had withdrawn earlier, but one of them flipped at Mulsanne Corner. Driver [[Anthony Davidson]] suffered two broken vertebrae but was able to exit the car himself. The other Toyota retired with mechanical difficulties shortly after sunset, giving Audi another victory.\n\nIn 2011, the race became the premier round of the [[Intercontinental Le Mans Cup]], an attempt to make a world championship for endurance racing again. In [[2012 24 Hours of Le Mans|2012]], the race became the centerpiece of the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]], the successor to the ILMC. The 2012 event was the first time the race was won by a [[hybrid electric vehicle]], which was the [[Audi R18#R18 e-tron quattro|Audi R18 e-tron quattro]].\n\n=== Since 2014 ===\n[[File:Porsche 919 Hybrid - Audi R18 e-tron quattro (18866096545).jpg|thumb|[[Porsche 919 Hybrid]] in the front of [[Audi R18]] in 2015|alt=]]\nRegulations were changed for [[2014 24 Hours of Le Mans|2014]], notably with all LMP1 cars must be closed-cockpit, some changes to the hybrid system, and the introduction of the slow zone system.<ref name=\"Slow Zones\">{{cite news|url=http://sportscar365.com/wec/new-safety-car-procedure-slow-zones-for-le-mans-revealed/ |title=New Safety Car Procedure, Slow Zones for Le Mans Revealed |last=Dagys |first=John |date=20 December 2013 |work=SportsCar365 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714153147/http://sportscar365.com/lemans/wec/new-safety-car-procedure-slow-zones-for-le-mans-revealed/ |archive-date=14 July 2014 |accessdate=20 December 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nPorsche returned to Le Mans in 2014 with a new factory LMP1 program, and Nissan returned to run an LMP1 program in [[2015 24 Hours of Le Mans|2015]]. Audi withdrew from racing at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in [[2016 24 Hours of Le Mans|2016]] and Nissan after only one attempt in 2015.\n\nPorsche won the race in 2015, 2016 and [[2017 24 Hours of Le Mans|2017]] with its [[Hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid]] [[Porsche 919 Hybrid|919]], and remains the most successful manufacturer at Le Mans, with 19 overall victories, including seven straight from 1981 to 1987.\n\nIn 2017, all prototype cars must be closed-cockpit.\n\nIn [[2018 24 Hours of Le Mans|2018]], [[Toyota in motorsport|Toyota]] took their first Le Mans win with [[Fernando Alonso]], [[S\u00e9bastien Buemi]] and [[Kazuki Nakajima]] driving. Toyota won the race again in [[2019 24 Hours of Le Mans|2019]].\n\n==Innovations==\nLe Mans has seen many innovations in [[automotive design]] to counteract the circuit's difficulties. These have either been dictated by rules or have been attempts by manufacturers to outwit the competition. Some innovations were incorporated into the common automobile.\n\n===Aerodynamics===\n[[Image:Porsche 908 Langheck am 1981-08-15.jpg|thumb|right|A 1969 [[Porsche 908|Porsche 908 ''Langheck'']]]]\n[[File:1950 Cadillac \"Le Monstre\" (44400201204).jpg|thumb|The 1950 Cadillac ''Le Monstre'']]\nOne of the keys to Le Mans is top speed, caused by the long straights that dominate the circuit. This has meant cars have attempted to achieve the maximum speeds possible instead of relying on downforce for the turns. While early competitors' cars were street cars with their bodywork removed to reduce weight, innovators like [[Bugatti]] developed cars which saw the beginnings of aerodynamics. Nicknamed ''tanks'' due to their similarity to military tanks in World War I, these cars used simple curves to cover all the mechanical elements of the car and increase top speed. Once Le Mans returned after World War II, most manufacturers would adopt closed bodies which were streamlined for better aerodynamics. A notable example in the changes brought about by aerodynamics are the 1950 entries by [[Briggs Cunningham]]. Cunningham entered two 1950 [[Cadillac Coupe de Ville]]s, one nearly stock and the other completely rebodied in a streamlined aluminum shape developed by [[Grumman|Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation]] that looked so unusual that it was nicknamed \"Le Monstre\" by the French press. The smoothing of body shapes and fairing-in of various parts of the machine brought about by the continual search for reduction of [[aerodynamic drag]] led to a separation from [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]] cars, which rarely had large bodywork.\n\nAs the years went on, bodywork became all enveloping, while at the same time lighter. The larger bodywork with spoilers were able to provide more downforce for the turns without increasing the [[Drag (physics)|drag]], allowing cars to maintain high speeds. Extended bodywork would usually concentrate on the rear of the car, usually being termed ''long tail''. The bodywork also began to cover the cockpit for less drag, although open cockpits would come and go over the years as rules varied. Aerodynamics reached its peak in 1989, before the Mulsanne Straight was modified. During the {{24hLM|1988}} race, the crew of a [[PRV engine|Peugeot]] powered [[Welter Racing|WM]] prototype taped over the engine openings, allowing [[Roger Dorchy]] to set a recorded speed of {{Convert|405|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} down the Mulsanne in a publicity stunt, although the car was almost undrivable elsewhere on the circuit and the engine was soon destroyed from a lack of cooling.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} However, for the {{24hLM|1989}} event, the [[Sauber C9|Mercedes-Benz C9]] reached {{Convert|400|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} under qualifying conditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mulsannescorner.com/maxspeed.html|title=Mulsanne's Corner: Maximum Speeds at Le Mans, 1961\u20131989|website=www.mulsannescorner.com|accessdate=8 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\n[[Image:1929 Bentley front 34 left 2.jpg|thumb|left|A 1929 [[supercharging|supercharged]] [[Bentley]]]]\n[[File:Mazda-787B-No55-July2011.jpg|thumb|left|1991 Mazda 787B, the only Le Mans winner with Wankel engine]]\nA wide variety of engines have competed at Le Mans, in attempts to not only achieve greater speed but also to have better [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]], and spend less time in the pits. Engine sizes have also varied greatly, with the smallest engines being a mere 569 cc ([[Simca 5|Simca Cinq]]) and the largest upwards of 8,000 cc ([[SRT Viper]] GTS-R). [[Supercharging]] was an early innovation for increasing output, first being raced in {{24hLM|1929}}, while [[turbocharging]] would not appear until {{24hLM|1974}}.\n\nThe first car to enter without an engine run by pistons would be in {{24hLM|1963}}, when [[Rover (car)|Rover]] partnered with [[British Racing Motors]] to run a [[gas turbine]] with mixed success, repeating again in {{24hLM|1965}}. The American Howmet Corporation would attempt to run a turbine again in {{24hLM|1968}} with even less success. Although the engines offered great power, they were hot and fuel-inefficient.\n\nAnother non-piston engine that would appear would be a [[Wankel engine]], otherwise known as the rotary engine. Run entirely by [[Mazda]] since its introduction in 1970, the compact engine would also suffer from fuel economy problems like the turbine had, yet would see the success that the turbine lacked. After many years of development, Mazda finally succeeded in being the only winner of the race to not have a piston-powered engine, taking the {{24hLM|1991}} event with the [[Mazda 787B|787B]]. Rotary engines were banned by the ACO following Mazda's win.\n\nAlternative fuel sources would also play a part in more normal engine designs, with the first non-gasoline car appearing in {{24hLM|1949}}. The Delettrez Special would be powered by a [[diesel engine]], while a second diesel would appear in the form of the M.A.P. the following year. Although diesel would appear at other times over the race existence, it would not be until 2006 when a major manufacturer, Audi, would invest in diesels and finally succeed, with the [[Audi R10 TDI|R10 TDI]].\n\n[[Ethanol fuel]] appeared in 1980 in a modified [[Porsche 911]], leading to a class win. Alternative biological fuel sources returned again in {{24hLM|2004}} with Team Nasamax's DM139-[[Judd (engine)|Judd]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mulsannescorner.com/nasamaxdm139.html | title = Mulsannescorner.com, \"2004 Nasamax DM139\" | accessdate = 6 August 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080915211057/http://www.mulsannescorner.com/nasamaxdm139.html| archivedate= 15 September 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> In 2008, [[biofuels]] (10% [[ethanol]] for petrol engines and [[biodiesel]] for diesel engines) were allowed.

Since 2010, they were able to compete for points and the championship. In 2012 the first KERS-equipped car won; the [[Audi R18#R18 e-tron quattro|Audi R18 e-tron]] with a flywheel hybrid system by [[Williams Hybrid Power]] activated and drove the front wheels. This was only allowed in certain zones, after the car had accelerated to at least 120&nbsp;km/h, in order to cancel out the acceleration advantage that four-wheelers could gain out of corners. In the same year, Toyota also started with a hybrid car, the [[Toyota TS030 Hybrid|TS030]], which used KERS to power its rear wheels, meaning its usage was not restricted.\n\n===Brakes===\nWith increased speeds around the track, brakes become a key issue for teams attempting to safely bring their cars down to a slow enough speed to make the Mulsanne Corner turn. [[Disc brake]]s were first seen in 1953 when the [[Jaguar C-Type]] raced at Le Mans. In 1955 the [[Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR]] introduced the [[Air brake (aircraft)|air brake]] using a large opening hood on the rear of the car. [[Ford]] used a quick change brake rotor in 1966 to achieve their first victory at Le Mans<ref>{{cite web |title=The Le Mans Committee \u2013 Victory in 1966 |url=https://corporate.ford.com/articles/history/ford-gt40-origins-le-mans-committee-victory.html |website=Ford vs. Ferrari |publisher=Ford |accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref>.\n\nIn the 1980s, [[anti-lock braking system]]s became standard on most [[Group C]] cars as a safety measure, making it less likely that cars lose control at high speeds. By the late 1990s, [[reinforced carbon-carbon]] brakes were adopted for better stopping power.\n\n==Successful marques and drivers==\n:''For a list of winning drivers, teams, and cars, see [[List of 24 Hours of Le Mans winners]].''\n[[Image:Tom Kristensen 2014-06-10 001.jpg|thumb|The most successful participant of all time at Le Mans, Danish driver [[Tom Kristensen (racing driver)|Tom Kristensen]], has nine wins (7 with [[Audi]]), the latest in 2013.|328x328px|alt=|left]]\n[[File:Hall of fame Le Mans-winners 2013.JPG|thumb|Tom Kristensen in the Walk of fame [[Le Mans]]-Winners 2013]]\nOver the years, many manufacturers have managed to take the overall win, while even more have taken class wins.

Jaguar has seven wins, while [[Bentley]], [[Alfa Romeo]], and Ford all won four races in a row, with Bentley recording two additional victories in other years. In 2018, Toyota became only the second Japanese marque to win, following Mazda in 1991. Mazda is also the only company to win with a [[Wankel engine|rotary]] engine.\n\nThree drivers stand apart for their number of victories. Initially [[Jacky Ickx]] held the record at six, scoring victories between 1969 and {{24hLM|1982}}, earning him an honorary citizenship to the town of Le Mans. His frequent racing-partner, [[Derek Bell (racing driver)|Derek Bell]], trailing by a single win, with five. However, [[Denmark|Dane]] [[Tom Kristensen (racing driver)|Tom Kristensen]] has beaten this record with nine wins between {{24hLM|1997}} and 2013, including six in a row. Three-time winner [[Woolf Barnato]] ({{24hLM|1928}} to {{24hLM|1930}}), American racing legend [[AJ Foyt|A. J. Foyt]] (1967) and [[Fernando Alonso]] (2018-2019) are the only drivers to have won every Le Mans in which they participated.\n\n[[Henri Pescarolo]] won the race four times, and holds the record for the most Le Mans appearances at 33. Japan's [[Yojiro Terada]] was active as a driver until 2008, and holds the record for the most Le Mans starts without an overall win. [[Graham Hill]] is the only driver to win the so-called ''[[Triple Crown of Motorsport]]'', winning the [[Indianapolis 500]] (1966), [[Monaco Grand Prix]] (1963, 1964, 1965, 1968, 1969), and the 24 Hours of Le Mans (1972).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usgpindy.com/news/story.php?story_id=1417 |title=Points Race Stays Tight; Montoya Joins Elite Company With Victory |author=Dan Knutson |accessdate=3 December 2007 |date=3 June 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106023236/http://www.usgpindy.com/news/story.php?story_id=1417 |archivedate=6 November 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://intakeinfo.com/automotive/monaco-grand-prix-glitz-draws-rising-stars.html |title=Monaco Grand Prix Glitz Draws Rising Stars |author=Henri Boulanger |publisher=IntakeInfo.com |accessdate=5 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211040252/http://intakeinfo.com/automotive/monaco-grand-prix-glitz-draws-rising-stars.html |archivedate=11 December 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Accidents==\n{{See also|List of 24 Hours of Le Mans fatal accidents}}\nLe Mans has seen a number of fatal accidents, due in part to the very high speed nature of all variants of the track throughout history. The [[1955 Le Mans disaster|largest]] one was in [[1955 24 Hours of Le Mans|1955]], when more than 80 spectators and driver [[Pierre Levegh]] were killed. In the wake of the disaster, many races were cancelled, including the Grand Prix races in [[German Grand Prix|Germany]], [[Spanish Grand Prix|Spain]], and [[Swiss Grand Prix|Switzerland]] (the latter as a part of a blanket ban on motorsport round-track races that was maintained until 2018).<ref>Swiss Traffic Law (German)</ref> The accident led to safety regulations in all motorsports for both driver and spectator protection.\n\nAlmost all decades in which Le Mans has been run have seen their fair share of horrific accidents, such as in [[1972 24 Hours of Le Mans|1972]] when Swede [[Joakim Bonnier]] was catapulted into a forest surrounding the circuit after hitting a privately entered Ferrari near the Indianapolis section; Bonnier was killed instantly. The 1980s was a decade where some of the race's worst-ever accidents occurred. Although Armco barriers had been installed along the straight in 1969 there were still no chicanes on the Mulsanne Straight \u2013 the place where almost all of the worst accidents took place during that time. The prototypes, most of which were equipped with very powerful turbocharged engines in those days, were capable of doing more than {{convert|240|-|250|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} before reaching the kink and would still be doing the same kind of speeds at the end of the {{convert|3.6|mi|km|adj=on|order=flip}} straight \u2013 and even through the kink, which was a flat-out bend for all the cars on the track. In {{24hLM|1981}}, Belgian [[Thierry Boutsen]] crashed horrifically on the Mulsanne Straight in his WM-Peugeot, killing a marshal, and in the same race Frenchman Jean-Louis Lafosse was killed also on the Mulsanne Straight when his Rondeau suffered suspension failure and steered very suddenly to the right and slammed into the Armco barrier on the driver's side at extreme speeds. The [[1984 24 Hours of Le Mans|1984]] race saw British privateer John Sheldon crashing at more than {{convert|200|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} at the Mulsanne Kink; his [[Aston Martin]] [[V8 engine|V8]] powered [[Nimrod NRA/C2B|Nimrod]] tore through the Armco barriers into the trees. The resulting explosion was so violent that the woods next to the track caught fire. Although Sheldon survived with severe burns, a track marshal was killed; two others were also severely injured. Sheldon's own teammate, American Drake Olson in the second Nimrod-Aston Martin who was following him down the straight, crashed heavily after running over Sheldon's bodywork; he went into severe shock but survived with minor injuries. The field was under the safety car for over an hour while the crash site was cleared and the destroyed Armco barriers were replaced.\n\nIn [[1985 24 Hours of Le Mans|1985]] a similar accident befell Briton Dudley Wood in a Porsche 962 during practice. The impact of the car against the Armco, considering Wood was doing more than {{convert|230|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}}, was so hard that it cracked the engine block. Wood survived without injury. Also in 1985 John Nielsen flipped his Sauber-Mercedes while going over the Mulsanne hump at more than {{convert|220|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The car landed on its roof and was destroyed, but Nielsen escaped without injury. In {{24hLM|1986}}, [[Jo Gartner]] drove a Porsche 962C into the Mulsanne barriers and was killed instantly after the car rolled multiple times, vaulted some Armco barriers, and knocked down a telegraph pole. And in [[1987 24 Hours of Le Mans|1987]], American [[Price Cobb]] crashed a works Porsche 962C after slipping on oil during Wednesday practice. The fuel tank exploded and the car burned to the ground but Cobb escaped without injury.\n\nGartner's fatal accident remained the most recent death in the race until Allan Simonsen's crash in [[2013 24 Hours of Le Mans|2013]]. However, there was one fatality during a practice session in [[1997 24 Hours of Le Mans|1997]] ([[Sebastien Enjolras]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailysportscar.com/?p=9717 |title=Mark Cole's Le Mans 2013 |publisher=Dailysportscar.com |date=2013-07-15 |accessdate=2013-08-05}}</ref>\n\nIn [[1999 24 Hours of Le Mans|1999]] the [[Mercedes-Benz CLR]]s suffered from aerodynamic instability leading to airborne cars. After initially happening at the Le Mans test day, Mercedes claimed to have solved the problem, only to have it occur again at warmup. [[Mark Webber]] was the unlucky driver whose car flipped on both occasions. The final and most damaging accident occurred during the race itself when [[Peter Dumbreck]]'s CLR became airborne, flying over the safety fencing and landing in the woods several metres away. No drivers were badly hurt in any of the three accidents, but Mercedes-Benz withdrew its remaining entry and ended its entire sportscar programme.\n\nIn [[2011 24 Hours of Le Mans|2011]], two horrific accidents occurred to two of the three factory [[Audi]]s in the LMP1 class. Near the end of the first hour, the No. 3 car driven by [[Allan McNish]] collided with one of the Ferrari GT cars, resulting in McNish's car smashing into the tyre wall and being thrown into the air at the Dunlop chicanes, resulting in pieces of bodywork flying over and nearly hitting many photographers on the other side of the barrier. In the eleventh hour of the race, another accident occurred, this time to the No. 1 car driven by [[Mike Rockenfeller]], when he had contact with another Ferrari GT car. In the runup to Indianapolis corner, Rockenfeller's Audi was sent into the outside barrier at over {{convert|170|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}}. Only the main cockpit safety cell of the car remained along with major damage being done to the barriers that needed to be repaired before the race was resumed. Audi had switched to a closed-cockpit car starting in 2011, a decision credited for the fact that neither driver was injured. The 2014 regulations required all cars to be closed-cockpit as a direct result of the 2011 accident. \n                                                                     \nIn [[2012 24 Hours of Le Mans|2012]], [[Anthony Davidson]], driving for the returning Toyota team in a [[Toyota TS030 Hybrid]], collided with a [[Ferrari 458 Italia|Ferrari 458 GT2]] of Piergiuseppe Perazzini, and became airborne before crashing into the tyre barrier of the Mulsanne Corner at high speed. The Ferrari also ended up in the barrier, flipping and coming to a halt on its roof.

This was given a limited cinema release, but is now available on DVD.\n\nThe race became the center of a major motion picture in 1971 when [[Steve McQueen]] released his simply titled ''[[Le Mans (film)|Le Mans]]'', starring McQueen as Michael Delaney, a driver in the 1970 event for the [[Gulf Oil|Gulf]] Porsche team. Likened to other motorsports films such as ''[[Grand Prix (1966 film)|Grand Prix]]'' for Formula One racing and ''[[Winning (film)|Winning]]'' for the [[Indianapolis 500]], ''Le Mans'' is the best known film to center on sports car racing. It was filmed during the race using modified racing cars carrying cameras, as well as purchased [[Porsche 917]]s, [[Ferrari 512]]s and [[Lola T70]]s for action shots made after the race. The [[Porsche 908]] which served as a camera car in the race actually finished, yet was so far behind the winners due to lengthy reel changes during pit stops that it was not classified in the results.\n\n''[[Michel Valliant (film)|Michel Valliant]] ''was a 2003 French movie about a French comic book motorsports hero that featured events from the {{24hLM|2002}} race although it was not explicitly about Le Mans. Again using two camera cars to tape action during the race, the French film was not as widely accepted as ''Le Mans'' had been. The 1974 TV show ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]'' featured an episode entitled \"[[The Race (Goodies episode)|The Race]]\" involving a comedic trio attempting to run Le Mans.\n\nA documentary film called ''[[Truth in 24]]'' narrated by [[Jason Statham]] was about the Audi team's effort to win a fifth straight title in 2008 in which Le Mans was prominently featured. A sequel film about the Audi team's victory in the 2011 race, ''Truth in 24 II'', was released four years later in 2012, also narrated by Statham.\n \nThe Ford versus Ferrari rivalry at Le Mans, one of the most famous battles in racing history, has been featured in:\n* a documentary film called ''The 24 Hour War'' directed by [[Adam Carolla]] and Nate Adams, starring AJ Baime, [[Henry Ford III]], David Hobbs and [[Mario Andretti]]<ref name=\"IMDb\">{{cite web|title=The 24 Hour War (2016)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4875844/r|website=IMDb.com|accessdate=12 June 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Ford v Ferrari]], a biopic directed by James Mangold starring [[Matt Damon]] and [[Christian Bale]]\n\n<!-- The second half of the third book in Patrick O'Connor's Black Tiger series, \"The Black Tiger at Le Mans\", published in 1958, has his heroes Woody and Worm racing the Black Tiger Mark II and winning the 24 hours of Le Mans race.-->\nThe race has also been used for several video games over the years, some of which have allowed players to compete for the full 24 hours.\n\n===Coverage===\n[[File:Helicopter -A\u00e9rospatiale AS 355N Ecureuil 2 - F-GMBA (48207349146).jpg|thumb|left|A helicopter that provided aerial coverage for 2019 race]]\n[[File:24 Heures Le Mans 2016 (27767747536).jpg|thumb|An ACO host covering the 2016 race|alt=]]\n[[Motors TV]] covered the Le Mans 24 Hours in its entirety in 2006 and 2007, including coverage of the scrutineering, qualifying, driver parade, warmup, and race.

The races take place over a full 24-hour day/night cycle, with starts on set times allowing cars from the same era to compete at the same time. A team typically consists of a car in each class, and the team with the most points accumulated over five or six classes is declared the overall winner. The classes are based on the era in which the cars would have competed. The exact class requirements are re-evaluated for every event, since for each event, the age for the youngest entries is shifted by two years. In the first event, five classes ran more short races; later events have featured six classes running fewer but longer races. Drivers are required to have an FIA International Competition license. This event also includes a large Concours d'Elegance and auction.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books|Endurance motor racing}}\n*[[24 Hours of Le Mans (motorcycle race)]]\n*[[24 Hours of LeMons]]\n*[[Endurance racing (motorsport)|Endurance racing]]\n*[[Le Mans 24 Hours video games]]\n*[[List of 24 Hours of Le Mans winners]]\n*[[List of 24 hours of Le Mans records]]\n*[[Triple Crown of Motorsport]]\n*[[Radio Le Mans]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Additional references==\n* {{in lang|fr}} Le Mans 1965 in Automobile Historique n\u00b048 May 2005\n* {{in lang|fr}} 24 heures du Mans 1973 in Automobile Historique n\u00b049 June/July 2005\n\n==External links==\n{{commons|24 Heures du Mans}}\n* [http://www.24h-lemans.com/en/ Le Mans official website]\n* [http://www.racingsportscars.com/photo_lemans.html Racing Sports Cars] \u2013 historical photos and results\n* [http://www.lemans-history.com Le Mans History] \u2013 The History of Le Mans 24 Hours race\n* [http://www.les24heures.fr 24h of Le Mans History and database]\n\n{{24 Hours of Le Mans}}\n{{24 Hours of Le Mans winners}}\n{{FIA World Endurance Championship races}}\n{{Automobile endurance races}}\n{{Coord|47|56|30|N|0|13|30|E|region:FR-72_type:landmark|display=title}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2013}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:24 Hours Of Le Mans}}\n[[Category:24 Hours of Le Mans| ]]\n[[Category:Sarthe]]\n[[Category:Recurring events established in 1923]]\n[[Category:Group C]]\n[[Category:World Sportscar Championship races|Le Mans]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Sarthe]]\n[[Category:1923 establishments in France]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the sports car race|the motorcycle race|24 Hours of Le Mans (motorcycle race)|other uses|24 Hours of Le Mans (disambiguation)|the 2020 race|2020 24 Hours of Le Mans}}\n{{short description|Sports car race held in France}}\n{{Infobox motor race\n|Race title = 24 Hours of Le Mans\n|Logo = 24_hours_Le_mans_logo.png\n|Track map = Circuit de la Sarthe track map.svg\n|Image_size = 225px\n|Series long = [[FIA World Endurance Championship]]\n|Series short = WEC\n|Venue = [[Circuit de la Sarthe]]\n|Sponsor = \n|First race = {{24hLM|1923}}\n|First series race = \n|Last race = [[2019 24 Hours of Le Mans|2019]]\n|Distance = \n|Laps = \n|Duration = 24 hours\n|Previous names = \n|Most wins driver = [[Tom Kristensen (racing driver)|Tom Kristensen]] (9)\n|Most wins team = [[Joest Racing]] (13)\n|Most wins manufacturer = [[Porsche]] (19)\n}}The '''24 Hours of Le Mans''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|'''24 Heures du Mans'''}}) is the world's oldest active [[Sports car racing|sports car race]] in [[Endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance racing]], held annually since {{24hLM|1923}} near the town of [[Le Mans]], [[France]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/motoring/weekly-auto-agenda-le-mans-1997970.html | title=Weekly auto agenda: Le Mans | publisher=[[The Independent]] | date=11 June 2010 | accessdate=22 April 2011 }}</ref> It is considered one of the most prestigious automobile races in the world<ref>{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/travel/le-mans-24-hours-attend-style/|title=An insider's guide to the Le Mans 24hours: how to experience the ultimate endurance race in style|date=2019-06-14|first=Eilidh|last=Hargreaves|url-access=limited|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref> and has been called the \"Grand Prix of Endurance and Efficiency\".

In 2011, it was a part of the [[Intercontinental Le Mans Cup]]. Since 2012, the race has been a part of the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]].<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.fiawec.com/en/past-seasons/36| title=Past seasons| website=fiawec.com| accessdate=4 April 2019}}</ref> In World Endurance Championship's super-season of May 2018 to June 2019, the 24 Hours of Le Mans was both the second and the last round of the season.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.fiawec.com/en/calendar/80| title=Calendar| website=fiawec.com| accessdate=4 April 2019}}</ref> \n\nLe Mans inspired 24-hour races around the globe, including at [[24 Hours of Daytona|Daytona]], [[24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring|N\u00fcrburgring]], [[Spa 24 Hours|Spa-Francorchamps]], and [[Bathurst 24 Hour|Bathurst]]. The [[American Le Mans Series]] and Europe's [[Le Mans Series]] of multi-event sports car championships were spun off from 24 Hours of Le Mans regulations. Other races include the [[Le Mans Classic]], a race for historic Le Mans race cars from years past held on the Circuit de la Sarthe, a [[24 Hours of Le Mans (motorcycle race)|motorcycle version of the race]] which is held on the shortened Bugatti version of the same circuit, a kart race (24 Heures Karting), a truck race (24 Heures Camions), and a parody race [[24 Hours of LeMons]].\n\n==Purpose==\nLaunched when [[Grand Prix motor racing]] was the dominant form of motorsport throughout Europe, Le Mans was designed to present a different test. Instead of focusing on the ability of a car company to build the fastest machines, the 24 Hours of Le Mans would instead concentrate on the ability of manufacturers to build sporty yet reliable cars. This encouraged innovation in producing reliable and [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel-efficient vehicles]], because [[Endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance racing]] requires cars that last and spend as little time in the pits as possible.\n\nAt the same time, the layout of the track necessitated cars with better aerodynamics and stability at high speeds. While this was shared with Grand Prix racing, few tracks in Europe had straights of a length comparable to the [[Mulsanne Straight|Mulsanne]]. Additionally, because the road is public and thus not as meticulously maintained as permanent racing circuits, racing puts more strain on the parts, increasing the importance of reliability.\n\nThe [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]] in the early 1970s led organizers to adopt a fuel economy formula known as [[Group C]] that limited the amount of fuel each car was allowed. Although it was later abandoned, fuel economy remains important as new fuel sources reduce time spent during pit stops. Such technological innovations have had a trickle-down effect and can be incorporated into consumer cars. This has also led to faster and more exotic [[supercar]]s as manufacturers seek to develop faster road cars in order to develop them into even faster GT cars.\n\nAdditionally, in recent years hybrid systems (flywheel, super-capacitor, battery coupled with both gasoline and diesel) have been championed in the LMP category as rules have been changed to their benefit and to further push efficiency.\n\n==Race==\n[[File:Le Mans Race Control.jpg|thumb|The [[Pit stop|pits]] at day]]\nThe race is held in June, leading at times to very hot conditions for drivers, particularly in closed vehicles with poor ventilation; rain is commonly seen.

It also tests endurance, with drivers frequently racing for over two hours before a relief driver can take over during a pit stop while they eat and rest. Current regulations mandate that three drivers share each competing vehicle.\n\nCompeting teams race in groups called \"classes\", or cars of similar specification, while also competing simultaneously for outright placing amongst all classes. Originally, the race showcased cars as they were sold to the general public, then called \"Sports Cars\", in contrast with the specialised [[race car|racing cars]] used in [[Grand Prix motor racing]]. Over time, the competing vehicles evolved away from their publicly available road car roots, and today the race is made of two overall classes: prototypes, and Grand Touring cars (similar to sports cars sold to the public).  These are further broken down into 2 sub-classes each,  constructors' prototypes, privateer prototypes and 2 subclasses of GT cars.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lemans.org/en/races/24h/discover-endurance/introduction.html | title=Two major car families | publisher=lemans.org | accessdate=22 April 2011 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807090320/http://www.lemans.org/en/races/24h/discover-endurance/introduction.html | archivedate=7 August 2011 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[Image:LeMans PitStop2.JPG|thumb|The pits at dawn|223x223px|alt=]]Competing teams have had a wide variety of organization, ranging from competition departments of road car manufacturers (eager to prove the supremacy of their products) to professional motor racing teams (representing their commercial backers, some of which are also car manufacturers who want to win without paying for their own teams) to amateur teams (racing as much to compete in the famous race as to claim victory for their commercial partners).\n[[File:Le Mans Pits at Night.jpg|thumb|The pits at night]]\nThe race has also spent long periods as a round of the [[World Sportscar Championship]], although Le Mans has always had a stronger reputation than the World Championship, and is a round of the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]]. The race is also known as a leg of the informal [[Triple Crown of Motorsport]] which links [[Formula One]], [[IndyCar]], and [[sports car racing]] to represent a career achievement for drivers. Additionally, it is seen as a leg of the [[Triple Crown (endurance racing)|Triple Crown of endurance racing]], which links the three largest sports car races together, with [[12 Hours of Sebring]] and [[24 Hours of Daytona]] forming the other legs.  Since 1998, the American Le Mans Series (now the [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]] [[United SportsCar Championship|Weathertech Sports Car Championship]]) holds an endurance race, along with the 12 hours of Sebring, every year called \"[[Petit Le Mans]]\", as a 10-hour American version. In 2014, the [[United SportsCar Championship|Weathertech Sports Car Championship]] (a merger of the races at Sebring; [[Petit Le Mans]] in [[Braselton]], Georgia; the [[6 Hours of Watkins Glen]] in [[Watkins Glen, New York|Watkins Glen]], New York; and the [[Rolex Sports Car Series]]' [[24 Hours of Daytona]]) held all four major American endurance classics in preparation for teams to race at [[Le Mans]].\n\n===Cars===\n[[File:GT's_Climbing_up_the_hill_to_the_Dunlop_Bridge_(48126931781).jpg|thumb|GT cars approaching Dunlop Bridge|alt=|left]]\nThe race has approximately 60 competitors. Each car was required to have at least two seats, but recently cars only need the ability to accommodate a second seat in the cockpit rather than the seat itself. No more than two doors are allowed; open cockpit cars do not require doors. Since 2014, all cars in the premier LMP1 category must have a roof due to safety concerns, with open-cockpit cars only permitted in the slightly slower LMP2 category. Since 2017, all prototype cars, LMP1 or LMP2, must have closed cockpits.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://auto-racing.speedtv.com/article/le-mans-inside-the-2014-lmp1-regulations/ |title=LE MANS: Inside The 2014 LMP1 Regulations |publisher=Auto-racing.speedtv.com |date=2012-11-27 |accessdate=2013-08-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130710021103/http://auto-racing.speedtv.com/article/le-mans-inside-the-2014-lmp1-regulations |archivedate=10 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAlthough all cars compete at the same time, there are separate classes. A prize is awarded to the winner of each class, and to the overall winner. The number of classes has varied over the years, but there are now four. Custom-built [[Le Mans Prototype]]s (LMP) are the top two classes, LMP1 and LMP2, divided by speed, weight, and power output. \n\nFor LMP2, teams are obliged to run one of four approved chassis \u2013 ORECA, Ligier, Dallara or Multimatic/Riley \u2013 mated with a standard 4.2-litre Gibson V8 engine. LMP1 teams are subject to no such restrictions, however, and their extra power, lower weight and more complex aerodynamics results in much quicker lap times; LMP1 cars are also permitted to use hybrid technology <ref>https://www.fiawec.com/en/news/differences-between-lmp1-and-lmp2/5907#:~:targetText=While%20LMP1%20is%20a%20category,teams%20with%20a%20lower%20budget.</ref>\n\nFrom 2011, the next two classes are production-based [[grand tourer]] (GT) classes, GT Endurance Pro and GT Endurance AM. Both of these classes use the [[LM GTE]], or \"Le Mans Grand Touring Endurance\" regulations. Although the top class is the most likely to be the overall winner, lower classes have won on occasion due to better reliability.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n===Drivers===\n[[File:United autosports le mans 2018 tuesday-01 (28896068288).jpg|thumb|left|Drivers photograph from 2018]]\nOriginally, there were no rules on the number of drivers of a car, or how long they could drive. Although almost all teams used two drivers in the early decades, some Le Mans drivers such as [[Pierre Levegh]] and [[E.R. Hall|Eddie Hall]] attempted to run the race solo, hoping to save time by not having to change drivers. This practice was later banned. Until the 1980s, there were teams in which only two drivers competed, but by the end of the decade, the rules were changed to stipulate that at least three drivers must drive each car.\n\nBy the 1990s, due to the speeds of the cars and the strain it puts on drivers, additional rules to reduce driver fatigue mandated that drivers could not drive for over 240 minutes over a 6-hour period, and that no one driver could run for over 14 hours total. With careful management of driver stints, this makes it possible to complete the race with only two drivers (as [[Jeroen Bleekemolen]] and Cooper MacNeil did in 2014), although the vast majority of teams still continue to use three drivers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.24h-lemans.com/en/race/historical_2_2_2501.html?recherche=1&annee=2014&nbparpage=9#topContent|title=ACO \u2013 Automobile Club de l'Ouest|website=www.24h-lemans.com|accessdate=8 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racer.com/wec-le-mans/item/104435-lm24-iron-man-rotation-for-macneil-and-bleekemolen|title=Iron Man Rotation for Macneil and Bleekemolen|work=www.racer.com|access-date=8 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617003459/http://www.racer.com/wec-le-mans/item/104435-lm24-iron-man-rotation-for-macneil-and-bleekemolen|archive-date=17 June 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, the driving time rules were further changed. If necessary, officials may require a drive time limit of 80 minutes of consecutive time behind the wheel, and a minimum 30 minute rest break.  The rule applies only if the air temperature is at least 32 Celsius (89.6 F).<ref>[https://www.fiawec.com/en/news/an-eye-on-the-clock/5136]</ref>\n\n===Traditions and unique rules===\n[[File:United-autosports-le-mans-2018-169 (41048826150).jpg|thumb|Fly-over with the tricolor]]\n[[File:Lemans-20100613-final.jpg|thumb|Marshals waving safety flags to congratulate Audi in 2010 race]]\nAlthough it has been a part of the [[World Sportscar Championship]] for most of its existence, the race has had different regulations for safety and competition reasons partly due to its length. For many decades, cars were required to run at least an hour into the race before they were allowed to refill fluids for the car, such as oil or coolant, with the exception of fuel. This was an attempt by the ACO to help increase efficiency and reliability. Cars which could not last the first hour without having to replace lost fluids were disqualified.\n\nAnother rule unique to Le Mans is that cars must be switched off while they are refuelled in the pits. Not only is this safer and less of a fire hazard, but it is also another test of reliability, as cars with the guaranteed ability to restart many times under race conditions are harder to make. Another element of this rule is that mechanics are not allowed to work on the car while it is being refuelled (other than helping a driver in or out of the car), which has led teams to adapt innovative ways in which to decrease the time of these lengthy pit stops. Drivers are allowed to get out of the car and be replaced by another driver during refuelling. Those rules are also in application in the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]].\n\nThere are various long-standing traditions at Le Mans, including the waving of the [[Flag of France|French tricolor]] to start the race. This is usually followed by a fly-over featuring jets trailing blue, white and red smoke. A similar flag tradition is the waving of safety flags during the final lap of the race by track marshals, congratulating the winners and other finishers.\n\nLe Mans was the venue for the first televised instance of a winning driver celebrating by spraying champagne instead of drinking it.<ref name=\"Miscellany pg 82\">G. Harding ''\"A Wine Miscellany\"'' pg 82, Clarkson Potter Publishing, New York 2005 {{ISBN|0-307-34635-8}}</ref> When [[Dan Gurney]] won the {{24hLM|1967}} race with co-driver [[A. J. Foyt]], the two drivers mounted the victory podium and Gurney was handed a magnum of champagne. Looking down, he saw Ford CEO [[Henry Ford II]], team owner [[Carroll Shelby]] and their wives, as well as several journalists who had predicted disaster for the high-profile duo. Gurney shook the bottle and sprayed everyone nearby. Gurney autographed and gave the bottle of champagne to ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' photographer Flip Schulke, who used it as a lamp for years before returning it to Gurney.<ref name=\"champagne1\">{{cite journal |url=http://allamericanracers.com/images/pdf/Champagne-Story-Eoin-Young.pdf |title=Dan Gurney's 1967 Champagne Week |last=Young |first=Eoin |authorlink=Eoin Young |journal=Victory Lane |date=November 2013 |pages=42\u201344 |accessdate=21 June 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"champagne2\">{{cite web |url=http://allamericanracers.com/le-mans-champagne-story-dan-gurney/ |title=Spraying the Champagne |publisher=Dan Gurney's All-American Racing |accessdate=21 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Schedule====\n[[File:United-autosports-le-mans-2018-141 (41019577000).jpg|thumb|Driver parade in Le Mans in 2018]]\nThe first race was held on 26\u201327 May 1923 and has since been run annually in June with exceptions in 1956, when the race was held in July; 1968, when it was held in September due to nationwide [[May 1968 events in France|political turmoil in May]] & in 2020, when it was moved to 19\u201320 September due to the [[COVID-19]] outbreak. The race has been cancelled ten times\u2014in 1936 (a labour strike during the [[Great Depression]]) and between 1940 and 1948 (World War II).\n\nThe race usually takes place on the second weekend of June, with qualifying and practice taking place on the Wednesday and Thursday before the race, following a car inspection on Monday and Tuesday. Currently, these sessions are held in the evening, with two separate two-hour sessions held each night. Friday serves as a day of rest and a parade of all the drivers through [[Le Mans]] is held.\n\nTest days held at the end of April or beginning of May served as a pre-qualification weeding out the slowest cars. However, in 2005 the exorbitant cost of transporting cars to and from Le Mans led organizers to move the test day to the first weekend of June. In fact pre-qualification was eliminated in 2000, meaning that all competitors invited to the test would be allowed into the race.\n\nSince 2001 the [[Le Mans Legend]] races have also been part of the schedule, usually running exhibition races during qualifying days, a few hours prior to the sessions for the Le Mans entrants.\n\nUntil 2008, the race started at 16:00 on Saturday (though in 1968, the race started at 14:00 due to the lateness of the race on the calendar). In 1984 and 2007, the start time was moved ahead to 15:00 due to the conflicting [[2007 French presidential election|election]]). In 2006, the ACO scheduled a 17:00 start time on Saturday, 17 June in order to maximise television coverage in between the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] games. Since 2009, when the race took place from 13\u201314 June, it starts at 15:00 local time ([[Central European Summer Time|CEST]], 13:00 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UT]]).\n\n====Classification====\n[[File:Shelby GT40.jpg|thumb|Bruce McLaren and Ken Miles winning car from 1966|alt=|left]]\nOriginally, the car that covered the greatest distance from its starting position was the winner. This is known to have caught out the [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] team in {{24hLM|1966}}. With a dominant 1\u20132 lead, the two cars slowed to allow for a [[photo opportunity]] at the finish line, with [[Ken Miles]] slightly ahead of [[Bruce McLaren]]. However, since McLaren's car had actually started much farther back on the grid than Miles's, McLaren's car had actually covered the greatest distance over the 24 hours. With the margin of victory determined to be eight metres, McLaren and his co-driver, [[Chris Amon]], were declared the winners. The decision cost Miles and [[Denny Hulme]] a victory. Miles had already won the other two endurance races at Sebring and Daytona. With a win at Le Mans, he would have become not only the first man to win all three, but the first to win them all in the same year.\n\nThe \"greatest distance\" rule was modified with the introduction of a rolling start in 1971, and now the car that completes the greatest distance as of the completion of the final lap \u2013 where \"greatest distance\" is measured by the start/finish line for all competitors \u2013 wins. When two cars finish the same number of laps, their finishing order is determined by the faster overall completion time. This rule was used in the [[2011 24 Hours of Le Mans]] to determine the race winner, when the top two finishers both completed 355 laps, with only 13 seconds difference between them.<ref>{{Citation|last=Fredstar88|title=Final Lap of 24 Hours of Le Mans 2011|date=2011-06-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCs8Nvt65uU|accessdate=2016-07-02}}</ref>\n\nAlthough \"greatest distance run\" determines the provisional order of finishers, additional requirements must be met for a car to be classified.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.fiawec.com/presentation/regulation.html|title=Regulation {{!}} FIA World Endurance Championship|website=www.fiawec.com|access-date=2016-07-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702204225/http://www.fiawec.com/presentation/regulation.html|archive-date=2 July 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n* A car must complete the last lap of the race, and must complete the entire circuit faster than a prescribed maximum lap time.  Ambiguity in this classification requirement has led to dramatic scenes where damaged cars have waited in the pits or on the edge of the track close to the finish line, then restarted their engines and crawled across the line to be listed amongst classified finishers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The practice of intentionally \"waiting for the final lap\" in this manner has been prohibited by rule in recent years.\n* Cars must complete 70 percent of the distance covered by the overall winner to be classified. A car failing to complete this number of laps, even if it finishes the last lap of the race, is not deemed worthy of classification because of poor reliability or speed.\nAll classification requirements hold except in exceptional circumstances, as determined by the race stewards.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====Le Mans start====\n{{Further|Standing start}}\n[[Image:Lemans Circuit Bugatti.JPG|thumb|right|The permanent pits and pit straight for both the ''[[Circuit de la Sarthe]]'' and Bugatti Circuit]]\n\nThe race traditionally began with what became known as the ''Le Mans start'', in which cars were lined up along the length of the pits. Until 1962, cars were lined up in order of engine capacity, but beginning in 1963 qualifying times determined the lineup. The starting drivers stood on the opposite side of the front stretch. When the French flag dropped to signify the start, the drivers ran across the track, entered and started their cars without assistance, and drove away. This became a safety issue in the late 1960s when some drivers ignored their safety harnesses, then a recent invention. This led to drivers running the first few laps either improperly harnessed due to attempting to do it while driving or sometimes not even harnessed at all, leading to several deaths when cars were involved in accidents due to the bunched field at the start.\n\nThis starting method inspired [[Porsche]] to locate the ignition key switch to the left of the steering wheel. In a left-hand drive car, this allowed the driver to use his left hand to start the engine, and his right hand to put the [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] into gear, which in turn shaves off a few tenths of a second.[[Image:Le Mans 2008 Rolling start.jpg|thumb|Rolling start of the {{24hLM|2008}} race|alt=|left]]\n\nAnother method for speeding up the start was developed by [[Stirling Moss]]. His car was waiting with first gear already engaged. When he jumped in, he switched the starter on without depressing the clutch. The car was immediately jerked forward by the starter motor, but the engine did not start due to low RPM. After a few seconds of motion, he then pushed the clutch down, allowing the engine to speed up and start while the car was moving.\n\nFeeling this type of start was unsafe, in the {{24hLM|1969}} race, [[Jacky Ickx]] opposed it by walking across the track while his competitors ran. Although he was nearly hit by a faster competitor's car while walking, Ickx took the time to fasten his safety belts before pulling away. Privateer [[John Woolfe]] died in an accident on the first lap of that race; Ickx won.\n\nThe traditional Le Mans start was changed for {{24hLM|1970}}. Cars were still lined up along the pit wall, but the drivers were already inside and strapped in. At the dropping of the French tricolor, the drivers started their engines and drove away. Since 1971, when that method was done away with, a [[rolling start]] (sometimes known as an ''[[Indianapolis 500|Indianapolis]] start'') begins the race.<ref name=\"24 key dates for the 24 Hours\">{{cite web|title=24 key dates for the 24 Hours|url=http://www.lemans.org/en/news/24-key-dates-for-the-24-hours_6843.html|publisher=ACO|accessdate=20 April 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422191720/http://www.lemans.org/en/news/24-key-dates-for-the-24-hours_6843.html|archivedate=22 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Circuit==\n[[Image:Circuit de la Sarthe track map.svg|thumb|right|The [[Circuit de la Sarthe]] with the [[Bugatti Circuit]] (dashed line)]]\n{{Main|Circuit de la Sarthe}}\nThe circuit on which the 24 Hours of Le Mans is run is named the [[Circuit de la Sarthe]], after the [[Departments of France|department]] that Le Mans is within. It consists of both permanent track and public roads that are temporarily closed for the race. Since 1923, the track has been extensively modified, mostly for safety reasons, and now is {{convert|13.626|km|3|abbr=on}} in length. Although it initially entered the town of Le Mans, the track was cut short in order to better protect spectators. This led to the creation of the [[Dunlop Tyres|Dunlop]] Curve and Tertre Rouge corners before rejoining the old circuit on the [[Mulsanne]]. Another major change was on the Mulsanne itself in 1990, when the [[FIA]] decreed that it would no longer sanction any circuit that had a straight longer than {{convert|2|km|1|abbr=on}}. To comply with this, two [[chicanes]] were added to the {{convert|6|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} straight. The addition of the chicanes was further influenced by the fact that the speed of [[Welter Racing|WM P88]]-[[PNV engine|Peugeot]] French driver [[Roger Dorchy]] had been timed at {{convert|405|kph|0|abbr=on}} during the [[1988 24 Hours of Le Mans|1988]] race.\n\nDue to the shorter length of the straights, top speeds at Le Mans are now generally around {{convert|205|mph|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}.\n\nThe public sections of the track differ from the permanent circuit, especially in comparison with the [[Circuit de la Sarthe#Bugatti Circuit|Bugatti Circuit]] which is inside the Circuit de la Sarthe. Due to heavy traffic in the area, the public roads are not as smooth or well kept. They also offer less grip because of the lack of soft-tyre rubber laid down from racing cars, though this only affects the first few laps of the race. The roads are closed only within a few hours of the practice sessions and the race, before being opened again almost as soon as the race is finished. Workers have to assemble and dismantle safety barriers every year for the public sections.\n\n==History==\n:''For a list of individual race reports, see [[:Category:24 Hours of Le Mans races]].''\n\n===1923\u20131939===\n[[Image:1923Lemans.JPG|thumb|A poster for the [[1923 24 Hours of Le Mans]]]]\n\nThe 24 Hours of Le Mans was [[1923 24 Hours of Le Mans|first run on 26 and 27 May 1923]], through public roads around Le Mans. Originally planned to be a three-year event awarded the [[Rudge-Whitworth]] Triennial Cup, with a winner being declared by the car which could go the farthest distance over three consecutive 24-hour races, this idea was abandoned in 1928 and overall winners were declared for each single year depending on who covered the farthest distance by the time 24 hours were up. The early races were dominated by French, British, and Italian drivers, teams, and cars, with [[Bugatti]], [[Bentley]], and [[Alfa Romeo]] being the top brands. Innovations in car design began appearing at the track in the late 1930s, with Bugatti and Alfa Romeo running highly aerodynamic bodywork in order to run down the [[Mulsanne Straight]] at faster speeds. The race was cancelled in 1936 due to [[Matignon Agreements (1936)|general strikes in France]], and the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939 resulted in a ten-year hiatus.\n\n===1949\u20131969===\n[[File:Jaguar Heritage Racing (7151624983).jpg|thumb|left|Jaguar D-Type in 1956]]\nFollowing the reconstruction of circuit facilities, the race was resumed in 1949<ref name=\"24 key dates for the 24 Hours\" /> with renewed interest from major automobile manufacturers. 1949 was also [[Ferrari]]'s first victory, the [[Ferrari 166 S|166MM]] of [[Luigi Chinetti]] and [[Peter Mitchell-Thomson, 2nd Baron Selsdon|Peter Mitchell-Thomson]].<ref name=\"24 key dates for the 24 Hours\" /> After the formation of the [[World Sportscar Championship]] in 1953, of which Le Mans was a part, Ferrari, [[Aston Martin]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]] and many others began sending multiple cars backed by their respective factories to compete for overall wins against their competitors. This competitiveness sometimes resulted in tragedy, as in the [[1955 Le Mans disaster]] during the {{24hLM|1955}} race in which [[Pierre Levegh]]'s car crashed into a crowd of spectators, killing more than 80&nbsp;people. The incident led to the widespread introduction of safety measures, not only at the circuit, but elsewhere in the motorsport world. Following the accident, the entire pit complex was razed and rebuilt further back allowing the pit straight to be widened, although there was still no barrier between the track and the pit lane. Safety standards improved but the cars got faster, and the move from open-cockpit roadsters to closed-cockpit coup\u00e9s resulted in speeds of over {{convert|320|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} on the Mulsanne. Ford entered the picture with the [[Ford GT40|GT40]], finally ending Ferrari's dominance with four straight wins (1966\u20131969) before the 1960s ended and the cars, and the race, changed substantially.\n\n===1970\u20131980===\n[[Image:Renault Alpine A443 Donington 2007.jpg|thumb|right|[[Renault Alpine A443]] from 1978]]\nFor the new decade, the race took a turn towards more extreme speeds and automotive designs. These extreme speeds led to the replacement of the typical standing ''Le Mans start'' with a rolling ''Indianapolis start''. Although production-based cars still raced, they were now in the lower classes while purpose-built sportscars became the norm. The [[Porsche 917]], [[Porsche 935|935]], and [[Porsche 936|936]] were dominant throughout the decade, but a resurgence by French manufacturers [[Equipe Matra Sports|Matra]]-[[Simca]] and [[Renault]] saw the first victories for the nation since the 1950 race. This decade is also remembered for strong performances from many privateer constructors, with two scoring the only victories for a privateer, in the decade. [[John Wyer]]'s [[Mirage (race car)|Mirage]] won in {{24hLM|1975}}, while [[Jean Rondeau]]'s self-titled chassis took {{24hLM|1980}}.\n\n===1981\u20131993===\n[[Image:Porsche 962 1988 Le Mans at Silverstone 2007.JPG|thumb|[[Group C]] [[Porsche 962]] from 1988|alt=|left]]\nThe rest of the 1980s was known for the dominance by Porsche under the new [[Group C]] race car formula that encouraged fuel efficiency. Originally running the effective [[Porsche 956|956]], it was later replaced by the [[Porsche 962|962]]. Both chassis were affordable enough for privateers to purchase them en masse, leading to the two model types winning six years in a row. Jaguar and Mercedes-Benz returned to sports car racing, with Jaguar being the first to break Porsche's dominance with victories in 1988 and 1990 (with the [[XJR-9]] and [[Jaguar XJR-12]] respectively). Mercedes-Benz won in 1989, with what was seen as the latest incarnation of the elegant \"[[Silver Arrows]]\", the [[Sauber C9]], while an influx of Japanese manufacturer interest saw prototypes from [[Nissan]] and Toyota. In 1988 too, a [[Welter Racing|WM]] [[Peugeot]] set up a new record speeding at {{convert|405|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} in the ''Ligne Droite des Hunaudi\u00e8res'', famous for its {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}} long straight.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.24h-lemans.com/en/news/24-hours-of-mans-the-records-to-be-beaten_2_2_1746_11149.html | title=THE RECORDS TO BE BEATEN | publisher=24h-lemans.com | accessdate=11 June 2014 }}</ref> [[Mazda]] would be the first Japanese manufacturer to succeed, with their unique [[Wankel engine|rotary]]-powered [[Mazda 787B|787B]] winning in 1991.\n\n[[File:Peugeot905 evo1ter 1993.jpg|thumb|[[Peugeot 905]] from 1993]]\nIn 1992 and 1993, Peugeot dominated the race with its [[Peugeot 905]] as the Group C formula and [[World Sportscar Championship]] were fading in participation.\n\nThe circuit would also undergo one of its most notable changes in {{24hLM|1990}}, when the 5&nbsp;km long Mulsanne was modified<ref name=\"24 key dates for the 24 Hours\" /> to include two chicanes in order to stop speeds of more than {{Convert|400|km/h|mi/h|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} from being reached. This began a trend by the ACO to attempt to slow the cars on various portions of the track; although speeds over {{Convert|320|km/h|mi/h|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} are still regularly reached at various points on a lap.\n\n===1994\u20131999===\n[[File:Le mans F40 1.jpg|thumb|[[Ferrari F40]] in 1995 race|alt=|left]]\nFollowing the demise of the [[World Sportscar Championship]], Le Mans saw a resurgence of production-based [[grand tourer]] cars. Thanks to a loophole in the rules, Porsche succeeded in convincing the ACO that a [[Dauer 962 Le Mans]] supercar was a production car, allowing Porsche to race their [[Porsche 962]] for one final time, dominating the field. Although the ACO attempted to close the loop hole for 1995, newcomer [[McLaren Cars|McLaren]] would win the race in their supercar's first appearance thanks to the reliability of the BMW V12 powered F1 GTR, beating faster yet more trouble-prone prototypes. The trend would continue through the 1990s as more exotic supercars were built in order to skirt the ACO's rules regarding production-based race cars, leading to [[Porsche]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], Toyota, Nissan, [[Panoz]], and [[Lotus Cars|Lotus]] entering the GT categories. This culminated in the {{24hLM|1999}} event, in which these GT cars were faced with the [[Le Mans Prototype]]s of [[BMW]], [[Audi]], and [[Ferrari]]. BMW would survive with the victory, their first and only overall Le Mans win to date, while Mercedes left sportscar racing indefinitely following three catastrophic though non-fatal crashes stemming from severe aerodynamic flaws with their [[Mercedes-Benz CLR|CLR]].\n\nThis strong manufacturer influence led the ACO to lending the Le Mans name to a sports car series in the United States in 1999, known as the [[American Le Mans Series]], which ran until the end of the [[2013 American Le Mans Series season|2013]] season after which it merged with [[Grand-Am Road Racing|Grand-Am]] to form the [[United SportsCar Championship]].\n\n===2000\u20132005===\n[[File:Audi R8 LMP, Le Mans 2000 (museum mobile 2013-09-03).JPG|thumb|Audi R8]]\n[[File:2003 Bentley Speed 8.jpg|thumb|Bentley Speed 8|alt=|left]]\nMany major automobile manufacturers withdrew from sports car racing after 1999 due to the high cost. Only Cadillac and Audi remained, and Audi easily dominated with the [[Audi R8 (race car)|R8]]. Cadillac pulled out three years later, and attempts by Panoz, [[Chrysler]], and [[MG (car)|MG]] to beat Audi all fell short. After three victories in a row, Audi provided engine, team staff, and drivers to [[Bentley]], a corporate partner, which had returned in 2001, and in 2003 the factory [[Bentley Speed 8]]s beat privateer Audis. The Chevrolet Corvette Racing Team and their C5-R won several times in the GTS class, finishing 1st and 2nd in 2001, 2002, and 2004. They finished 2nd and 3rd in 2003 behind Ferrari.\n\n=== 2006\u20132013 ===\n[[Image:Audi R10 1.JPG|thumb|A [[diesel engine|diesel]]-powered Audi R10 TDI|alt=|left]]\n[[File:24 Hours of Le Mans 2010 - Audi Sport Team Joest 8.jpg|thumb|Audi R15 TDI|alt=|left]]\nAt the end of 2005, after five overall victories for the R8, and six to its V8 turbo engine, Audi took on a new challenge by introducing a [[diesel engine]]d prototype known as the [[Audi R10 TDI|R10 TDI]]. Although not the first diesel to race, it was the first to win at Le Mans. This era saw other alternative fuel sources being used, including [[bio-ethanol]], while Peugeot decided to follow Audi's lead and also pursue a diesel entry in 2007 with their [[Peugeot 908 HDi FAP|908 HDi FAP]].[[File:Peugeot 908 24 Hours Le Mans 2009.jpg|thumb|Peugeot 908 HDi FAP|alt=]]In the [[2008 24 Hours of Le Mans|2008 race]] between the [[Audi R10 TDI]] and the [[Peugeot 908 HDi FAP]], the Audi won by a margin of less than 10 minutes. For the [[2009 24 Hours of Le Mans]], Peugeot introduced a new energy-recovery system similar to the [[Kinetic energy recovery system|KERS]] used in [[Formula One]].<ref>{{cite news|title= 908 HY to close Le Mans Series in hybrid style|publisher=AutoBlog}}</ref> Aston Martin entered the [[LMP1]] category, but still raced in [[FIA GT1 World Championship|GT1]] with private teams. Audi returned with the new R15 TDI, but Peugeot prevailed in its first overall win since 1993.\n\nThe [[2010 24 Hours of Le Mans|2010]] running reaffirmed the race as a test of endurance and reliability. In adjusting their cars and engines to adhere to the 2010 regulations, Peugeot chose overall speed while Audi chose reliability. At the end of the race, all four Peugeots had retired, three due to engine failure, while Audi finished 1\u20132\u20133.\n\nThe [[2011 24 Hours of Le Mans|2011]] and [[2012 24 Hours of Le Mans|2012]] races were marred by a series of accidents. In 2011, in the first hour, the Audi driven by Allan McNish crashed heavily, barrel rolling into a tire wall shortly after the [[Dunlop Bridge]]. At night, the defending race-winning Audi driven by [[Mike Rockenfeller]] crashed in similar fashion between the Mulsanne and Indianapolis corners. Neither driver was injured, nor were any spectators. The third Audi entry driven by [[Marcel F\u00e4ssler (racing driver)|Marcel F\u00e4ssler]], [[Andr\u00e9 Lotterer]], and [[Beno\u00eet Tr\u00e9luyer]] won the race. The 2012 race saw two factory Toyotas replace Peugeot, which had withdrawn earlier, but one of them flipped at Mulsanne Corner. Driver [[Anthony Davidson]] suffered two broken vertebrae but was able to exit the car himself. The other Toyota retired with mechanical difficulties shortly after sunset, giving Audi another victory.\n\nIn 2011, the race became the premier round of the [[Intercontinental Le Mans Cup]], an attempt to make a world championship for endurance racing again. In [[2012 24 Hours of Le Mans|2012]], the race became the centerpiece of the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]], the successor to the ILMC. The 2012 event was the first time the race was won by a [[hybrid electric vehicle]], which was the [[Audi R18#R18 e-tron quattro|Audi R18 e-tron quattro]].\n\n=== Since 2014 ===\n[[File:Porsche 919 Hybrid - Audi R18 e-tron quattro (18866096545).jpg|thumb|[[Porsche 919 Hybrid]] in the front of [[Audi R18]] in 2015|alt=]]\nRegulations were changed for [[2014 24 Hours of Le Mans|2014]], notably with all LMP1 cars must be closed-cockpit, some changes to the hybrid system, and the introduction of slow zone system.<ref name=\"Slow Zones\">{{cite news|url=http://sportscar365.com/wec/new-safety-car-procedure-slow-zones-for-le-mans-revealed/ |title=New Safety Car Procedure, Slow Zones for Le Mans Revealed |last=Dagys |first=John |date=20 December 2013 |work=SportsCar365 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714153147/http://sportscar365.com/lemans/wec/new-safety-car-procedure-slow-zones-for-le-mans-revealed/ |archive-date=14 July 2014 |accessdate=20 December 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nPorsche returned to Le Mans in 2014 with a new factory LMP1 program, and Nissan returned to run an LMP1 program in [[2015 24 Hours of Le Mans|2015]]. Audi withdrew from racing at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in [[2016 24 Hours of Le Mans|2016]] and Nissan after only one attempt in 2015.\n\nPorsche won the race in 2015, 2016 and [[2017 24 Hours of Le Mans|2017]] with its [[Hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid]] [[Porsche 919 Hybrid|919]], and remains the most successful manufacturer at Le Mans, with 19 overall victories, including seven straight from 1981 to 1987.\n\nIn 2017, all prototype cars must be closed-cockpit.\n\nIn [[2018 24 Hours of Le Mans|2018]], [[Toyota in motorsport|Toyota]] took their first Le Mans win with [[Fernando Alonso]], [[S\u00e9bastien Buemi]] and [[Kazuki Nakajima]] driving. Toyota won the race again in [[2019 24 Hours of Le Mans|2019]].\n\n==Innovations==\nLe Mans has seen many innovations in [[automotive design]] to counteract the circuit's difficulties. These have either been dictated by rules or have been attempts by manufacturers to outwit the competition. Some innovations were incorporated into the common automobile.\n\n===Aerodynamics===\n[[Image:Porsche 908 Langheck am 1981-08-15.jpg|thumb|right|A 1969 [[Porsche 908|Porsche 908 ''Langheck'']]]]\n[[File:1950 Cadillac \"Le Monstre\" (44400201204).jpg|thumb|The 1950 Cadillac ''Le Monstre'']]\nOne of the keys to Le Mans is top speed, caused by the long straights that dominate the circuit. This has meant cars have attempted to achieve the maximum speeds possible instead of relying on downforce for the turns. While early competitors' cars were street cars with their bodywork removed to reduce weight, innovators like [[Bugatti]] developed cars which saw the beginnings of aerodynamics. Nicknamed ''tanks'' due to their similarity to military tanks in World War I, these cars used simple curves to cover all the mechanical elements of the car and increase top speed. Once Le Mans returned after World War II, most manufacturers would adopt closed bodies which were streamlined for better aerodynamics. A notable example in the changes brought about by aerodynamics are the 1950 entries by [[Briggs Cunningham]]. Cunningham entered two 1950 [[Cadillac Coupe de Ville]]s, one nearly stock and the other completely rebodied in a streamlined aluminum shape developed by [[Grumman|Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation]] that looked so unusual that it was nicknamed \"Le Monstre\" by the French press. The smoothing of body shapes and fairing-in of various parts of the machine brought about by the continual search for reduction of [[aerodynamic drag]] led to a separation from [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]] cars, which rarely had large bodywork.\n\nAs the years went on, bodywork became all enveloping, while at the same time lighter. The larger bodywork with spoilers were able to provide more downforce for the turns without increasing the [[Drag (physics)|drag]], allowing cars to maintain high speeds. Extended bodywork would usually concentrate on the rear of the car, usually being termed ''long tail''. The bodywork also began to cover the cockpit for less drag, although open cockpits would come and go over the years as rules varied. Aerodynamics reached its peak in 1989, before the Mulsanne Straight was modified. During the {{24hLM|1988}} race, the crew of a [[PRV engine|Peugeot]] powered [[Welter Racing|WM]] prototype taped over the engine openings, allowing [[Roger Dorchy]] to set a recorded speed of {{Convert|405|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} down the Mulsanne in a publicity stunt, although the car was almost undrivable elsewhere on the circuit and the engine was soon destroyed from a lack of cooling.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} However, for the {{24hLM|1989}} event, the [[Sauber C9|Mercedes-Benz C9]] reached {{Convert|400|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} under qualifying conditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mulsannescorner.com/maxspeed.html|title=Mulsanne's Corner: Maximum Speeds at Le Mans, 1961\u20131989|website=www.mulsannescorner.com|accessdate=8 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\n[[Image:1929 Bentley front 34 left 2.jpg|thumb|left|A 1929 [[supercharging|supercharged]] [[Bentley]]]]\n[[File:Mazda-787B-No55-July2011.jpg|thumb|left|1991 Mazda 787B, the only Le Mans winner with Wankel engine]]\nA wide variety of engines have competed at Le Mans, in attempts to not only achieve greater speed but also to have better [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]], and spend less time in the pits. Engine sizes have also varied greatly, with the smallest engines being a mere 569 cc ([[Simca 5|Simca Cinq]]) and the largest upwards of 8,000 cc ([[SRT Viper]] GTS-R). [[Supercharging]] was an early innovation for increasing output, first being raced in {{24hLM|1929}}, while [[turbocharging]] would not appear until {{24hLM|1974}}.\n\nThe first car to enter without an engine run by pistons would be in {{24hLM|1963}}, when [[Rover (car)|Rover]] partnered with [[British Racing Motors]] to run a [[gas turbine]] with mixed success, repeating again in {{24hLM|1965}}. The American Howmet Corporation would attempt to run a turbine again in {{24hLM|1968}} with even less success. Although the engines offered great power, they were hot and fuel-inefficient.\n\nAnother non-piston engine that would appear would be a [[Wankel engine]], otherwise known as the rotary engine. Run entirely by [[Mazda]] since its introduction in 1970, the compact engine would also suffer from fuel economy problems like the turbine had, yet would see the success that the turbine lacked. After many years of development, Mazda finally succeeded in being the only winner of the race to not have a piston-powered engine, taking the {{24hLM|1991}} event with the [[Mazda 787B|787B]]. Rotary engines were banned by the ACO following Mazda's win.\n\nAlternative fuel sources would also play a part in more normal engine designs, with the first non-gasoline car appearing in {{24hLM|1949}}. The Delettrez Special would be powered by a [[diesel engine]], while a second diesel would appear in the form of the M.A.P. the following year. Although diesel would appear at other times over the race existence, it would not be until 2006 when a major manufacturer, Audi, would invest in diesels and finally succeed, with the [[Audi R10 TDI|R10 TDI]].\n\n[[Ethanol fuel]] appeared in 1980 in a modified [[Porsche 911]], leading to a class win. Alternative biological fuel sources returned again in {{24hLM|2004}} with Team Nasamax's DM139-[[Judd (engine)|Judd]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mulsannescorner.com/nasamaxdm139.html | title = Mulsannescorner.com, \"2004 Nasamax DM139\" | accessdate = 6 August 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080915211057/http://www.mulsannescorner.com/nasamaxdm139.html| archivedate= 15 September 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> In 2008, [[biofuels]] (10% [[ethanol]] for petrol engines and [[biodiesel]] for diesel engines) were allowed.

Since 2010, they were able to compete for points and the championship. In 2012 the first KERS-equipped car won; the [[Audi R18#R18 e-tron quattro|Audi R18 e-tron]] with a flywheel hybrid system by [[Williams Hybrid Power]] activated and drove the front wheels. This was only allowed in certain zones, after the car had accelerated to at least 120&nbsp;km/h, in order to cancel out the acceleration advantage that four-wheelers could gain out of corners. In the same year, Toyota also started with a hybrid car, the [[Toyota TS030 Hybrid|TS030]], which used KERS to power its rear wheels, meaning its usage was not restricted.\n\n===Brakes===\nWith increased speeds around the track, brakes become a key issue for teams attempting to safely bring their cars down to a slow enough speed to make the Mulsanne Corner turn. [[Disc brake]]s were first seen in 1953 when the [[Jaguar C-Type]] raced at Le Mans. In 1955 the [[Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR]] introduced the [[Air brake (aircraft)|air brake]] using a large opening hood on the rear of the car. [[Ford]] used a quick change brake rotor in 1966 to achieve their first victory at Le Mans<ref>{{cite web |title=The Le Mans Committee \u2013 Victory in 1966 |url=https://corporate.ford.com/articles/history/ford-gt40-origins-le-mans-committee-victory.html |website=Ford vs. Ferrari |publisher=Ford |accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref>.\n\nIn the 1980s, [[anti-lock braking system]]s became standard on most [[Group C]] cars as a safety measure, making it less likely that cars lose control at high speeds.

[[Audi]] is next with thirteen wins,<ref>{{cite web|title=Audi wins 13th title at Le Mans|url=http://espn.go.com/racing/story/_/id/11086548/audi-trio-marcel-fassler-andre-lotterer-benoit-treluyer-claims-victory-24-hours-le-mans|website=ESPN|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=16 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Baldwin|first1=Alan|title=Audi win Le Mans for 13th time|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/06/15/uk-motor-racing-lemans-winner-idUKKBN0EQ0NT20140615|website=Reuters|publisher=Reuters UK|accessdate=16 June 2014}}</ref> and [[Ferrari]] follows with nine, also including six in a row from 1960 to 1965.

Jaguar has seven wins, while [[Bentley]], [[Alfa Romeo]], and Ford all won four races in a row, with Bentley recording two additional victories in other years. In 2018, Toyota became only the second Japanese marque to win, following Mazda in 1991. Mazda is also the only company to win with a [[Wankel engine|rotary]] engine.\n\nThree drivers stand apart for their number of victories. Initially [[Jacky Ickx]] held the record at six, scoring victories between 1969 and {{24hLM|1982}}, earning him an honorary citizenship to the town of Le Mans. His frequent racing-partner, [[Derek Bell (racing driver)|Derek Bell]], trailing by a single win, with five. However, [[Denmark|Dane]] [[Tom Kristensen (racing driver)|Tom Kristensen]] has beaten this record with nine wins between {{24hLM|1997}} and 2013, including six in a row. Three-time winner [[Woolf Barnato]] ({{24hLM|1928}} to {{24hLM|1930}}), American racing legend [[AJ Foyt|A. J. Foyt]] (1967) and [[Fernando Alonso]] (2018-2019) are the only drivers to have won every Le Mans in which they participated.\n\n[[Henri Pescarolo]] won the race four times, and holds the record for the most Le Mans appearances at 33. Japan's [[Yojiro Terada]] was active as a driver until 2008, and holds the record for the most Le Mans starts without an overall win. [[Graham Hill]] is the only driver to win the so-called ''[[Triple Crown of Motorsport]]'', winning the [[Indianapolis 500]] (1966), [[Monaco Grand Prix]] (1963, 1964, 1965, 1968, 1969), and the 24 Hours of Le Mans (1972).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usgpindy.com/news/story.php?story_id=1417 |title=Points Race Stays Tight; Montoya Joins Elite Company With Victory |author=Dan Knutson |accessdate=3 December 2007 |date=3 June 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106023236/http://www.usgpindy.com/news/story.php?story_id=1417 |archivedate=6 November 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://intakeinfo.com/automotive/monaco-grand-prix-glitz-draws-rising-stars.html |title=Monaco Grand Prix Glitz Draws Rising Stars |author=Henri Boulanger |publisher=IntakeInfo.com |accessdate=5 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211040252/http://intakeinfo.com/automotive/monaco-grand-prix-glitz-draws-rising-stars.html |archivedate=11 December 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Accidents==\n{{See also|List of 24 Hours of Le Mans fatal accidents}}\nLe Mans has seen a number of fatal accidents, due in part to the very high speed nature of all variants of the track throughout history. The [[1955 Le Mans disaster|largest]] one was in [[1955 24 Hours of Le Mans|1955]], when more than 80 spectators and driver [[Pierre Levegh]] were killed. In the wake of the disaster, many races were cancelled, including the Grand Prix races in [[German Grand Prix|Germany]], [[Spanish Grand Prix|Spain]], and [[Swiss Grand Prix|Switzerland]] (the latter as a part of a blanket ban on motorsport round-track races that was maintained until 2018).<ref>Swiss Traffic Law (German)</ref> The accident led to safety regulations in all motorsports for both driver and spectator protection.\n\nAlmost all decades in which Le Mans has been run have seen their fair share of horrific accidents, such as in [[1972 24 Hours of Le Mans|1972]] when Swede [[Joakim Bonnier]] was catapulted into a forest surrounding the circuit after hitting a privately entered Ferrari near the Indianapolis section; Bonnier was killed instantly. The 1980s was a decade where some of the race's worst-ever accidents occurred. Although Armco barriers had been installed along the straight in 1969 there were still no chicanes on the Mulsanne Straight \u2013 the place where almost all of the worst accidents took place during that time. The prototypes, most of which were equipped with very powerful turbocharged engines in those days, were capable of doing more than {{convert|240|-|250|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} before reaching the kink and would still be doing the same kind of speeds at the end of the {{convert|3.6|mi|km|adj=on|order=flip}} straight \u2013 and even through the kink, which was a flat-out bend for all the cars on the track. In {{24hLM|1981}}, Belgian [[Thierry Boutsen]] crashed horrifically on the Mulsanne Straight in his WM-Peugeot, killing a marshal, and in the same race Frenchman Jean-Louis Lafosse was killed also on the Mulsanne Straight when his Rondeau suffered suspension failure and steered very suddenly to the right and slammed into the Armco barrier on the driver's side at extreme speeds. The [[1984 24 Hours of Le Mans|1984]] race saw British privateer John Sheldon crashing at more than {{convert|200|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} at the Mulsanne Kink; his [[Aston Martin]] [[V8 engine|V8]] powered [[Nimrod NRA/C2B|Nimrod]] tore through the Armco barriers into the trees. The resulting explosion was so violent that the woods next to the track caught fire. Although Sheldon survived with severe burns, a track marshal was killed; two others were also severely injured. Sheldon's own teammate, American Drake Olson in the second Nimrod-Aston Martin who was following him down the straight, crashed heavily after running over Sheldon's bodywork; he went into severe shock but survived with minor injuries. The field was under the safety car for over an hour while the crash site was cleared and the destroyed Armco barriers were replaced.\n\nIn [[1985 24 Hours of Le Mans|1985]] a similar accident befell Briton Dudley Wood in a Porsche 962 during practice. The impact of the car against the Armco, considering Wood was doing more than {{convert|230|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}}, was so hard that it cracked the engine block. Wood survived without injury. Also in 1985 John Nielsen flipped his Sauber-Mercedes while going over the Mulsanne hump at more than {{convert|220|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The car landed on its roof and was destroyed, but Nielsen escaped without injury. In {{24hLM|1986}}, [[Jo Gartner]] drove a Porsche 962C into the Mulsanne barriers and was killed instantly after the car rolled multiple times, vaulted some Armco barriers, and knocked down a telegraph pole. And in [[1987 24 Hours of Le Mans|1987]], American [[Price Cobb]] crashed a works Porsche 962C after slipping on oil during Wednesday practice. The fuel tank exploded and the car burned to the ground but Cobb escaped without injury.\n\nGartner's fatal accident remained the most recent death in the race until Allan Simonsen's crash in [[2013 24 Hours of Le Mans|2013]]. However, there was one fatality during a practice session in [[1997 24 Hours of Le Mans|1997]] ([[Sebastien Enjolras]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailysportscar.com/?p=9717 |title=Mark Cole's Le Mans 2013 |publisher=Dailysportscar.com |date=2013-07-15 |accessdate=2013-08-05}}</ref>\n\nIn [[1999 24 Hours of Le Mans|1999]] the [[Mercedes-Benz CLR]]s suffered from aerodynamic instability leading to airborne cars. After initially happening at the Le Mans test day, Mercedes claimed to have solved the problem, only to have it occur again at warmup. [[Mark Webber]] was the unlucky driver whose car flipped on both occasions. The final and most damaging accident occurred during the race itself when [[Peter Dumbreck]]'s CLR became airborne, flying over the safety fencing and landing in the woods several metres away. No drivers were badly hurt in any of the three accidents, but Mercedes-Benz withdrew its remaining entry and ended its entire sportscar programme.\n\nIn [[2011 24 Hours of Le Mans|2011]], two horrific accidents occurred to two of the three factory [[Audi]]s in the LMP1 class. Near the end of the first hour, the No. 3 car driven by [[Allan McNish]] collided with one of the Ferrari GT cars, resulting in McNish's car smashing into the tyre wall and being thrown into the air at the Dunlop chicanes, resulting in pieces of bodywork flying over and nearly hitting many photographers on the other side of the barrier. In the eleventh hour of the race, another accident occurred, this time to the No. 1 car driven by [[Mike Rockenfeller]], when he had contact with another Ferrari GT car. In the runup to Indianapolis corner, Rockenfeller's Audi was sent into the outside barrier at over {{convert|170|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}}. Only the main cockpit safety cell of the car remained along with major damage being done to the barriers that needed to be repaired before the race was resumed. Audi had switched to a closed-cockpit car starting in 2011, a decision credited for the fact that neither driver was injured. The 2014 regulations required all cars to be closed-cockpit as a direct result of the 2011 accident. \n                                                                     \nIn [[2012 24 Hours of Le Mans|2012]], [[Anthony Davidson]], driving for the returning Toyota team in a [[Toyota TS030 Hybrid]], collided with a [[Ferrari 458 Italia|Ferrari 458 GT2]] of Piergiuseppe Perazzini, and became airborne before crashing into the tyre barrier of the Mulsanne Corner at high speed. The Ferrari also ended up in the barrier, flipping and coming to a halt on its roof.

This was given a limited cinema release, but is now available on DVD.\n\nThe race became the center of a major motion picture in 1971 when [[Steve McQueen]] released his simply titled ''[[Le Mans (film)|Le Mans]]'', starring McQueen as Michael Delaney, a driver in the 1970 event for the [[Gulf Oil|Gulf]] Porsche team. Likened to other motorsports films such as ''[[Grand Prix (1966 film)|Grand Prix]]'' for Formula One racing and ''[[Winning (film)|Winning]]'' for the [[Indianapolis 500]], ''Le Mans'' is the best known film to center on sports car racing. It was filmed during the race using modified racing cars carrying cameras, as well as purchased [[Porsche 917]]s, [[Ferrari 512]]s and [[Lola T70]]s for action shots made after the race. The [[Porsche 908]] which served as a camera car in the race actually finished, yet was so far behind the winners due to lengthy reel changes during pit stops that it was not classified in the results.\n\n''[[Michel Valliant (film)|Michel Valliant]] ''was a 2003 French movie about a French comic book motorsports hero that featured events from the {{24hLM|2002}} race although it was not explicitly about Le Mans. Again using two camera cars to tape action during the race, the French film was not as widely accepted as ''Le Mans'' had been. The 1974 TV show ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]'' featured an episode entitled \"[[The Race (Goodies episode)|The Race]]\" involving a comedic trio attempting to run Le Mans.\n\nA documentary film called ''[[Truth in 24]]'' narrated by [[Jason Statham]] was about the Audi team's effort to win a fifth straight title in 2008 in which Le Mans was prominently featured. A sequel film about the Audi team's victory in the 2011 race, ''Truth in 24 II'', was released four years later in 2012, also narrated by Statham.\n \nThe Ford versus Ferrari rivalry at Le Mans, one of the most famous battles in racing history, has been featured in:\n* a documentary film called ''The 24 Hour War'' directed by [[Adam Carolla]] and Nate Adams, starring AJ Baime, [[Henry Ford III]], David Hobbs and [[Mario Andretti]]<ref name=\"IMDb\">{{cite web|title=The 24 Hour War (2016)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4875844/r|website=IMDb.com|accessdate=12 June 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Ford v Ferrari]], a biopic directed by James Mangold starring [[Matt Damon]] and [[Christian Bale]]\n\n<!-- The second half of the third book in Patrick O'Connor's Black Tiger series, \"The Black Tiger at Le Mans\", published in 1958, has his heroes Woody and Worm racing the Black Tiger Mark II and winning the 24 hours of Le Mans race.-->\nThe race has also been used for several video games over the years, some of which have allowed players to compete for the full 24 hours.\n\n===Coverage===\n[[File:Helicopter -A\u00e9rospatiale AS 355N Ecureuil 2 - F-GMBA (48207349146).jpg|thumb|left|A helicopter that provided aerial coverage for 2019 race]]\n[[File:24 Heures Le Mans 2016 (27767747536).jpg|thumb|An ACO host covering the 2016 race|alt=]]\n[[Motors TV]] covered the Le Mans 24 Hours in its entirety in 2006 and 2007, including coverage of the scrutineering, qualifying, driver parade, warmup, and race. In the United States, FOX owned [[SPEED Channel]], followed by [[Fox Sports 1]] and [[Fox Sports 2]] aired complete race coverage live either on-air or online through a combination of coverage from the French host broadcaster and its own pit reporting crew for a number of years. That deal ended after the 2017 season.  A United States television deal was not done for the 2018\u201319 WEC Super Season because of a renegotiation of its European contract.\n\nIn 2008, [[Eurosport]] secured a multi-year deal to show the entire race, including the qualifying and the motorcycle race. Every hour of the 2008 race was broadcast in segments on the main channel and on [[Eurosport 2]], but in recent years, a couple of hours were missed due to scheduling clashes with other sporting events.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tv.eurosport.co.uk/tvschedule.shtml |title=Eurosport |accessdate=11 October 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101013122840/http://tv.eurosport.co.uk/tvschedule.shtml| archivedate= 13 October 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> In addition, Eurosport provided live streaming on its website to subscribers.

These exhibition races involve classic cars that had previously run at Le Mans or are similar to ones that had. Each year, a particular era of cars may participate, with the featured era changing from year to year. Though most drivers in this event are amateurs, some noted professional drivers have appeared to race cars they had previously run, such as [[Stirling Moss]] and [[Derek Bell (racing driver)|Derek Bell]].\n[[File:DSC03817-Le Mans Classic 2018.jpg|thumb|Le Mans Start at Le Mans Classic 2018]]\n{{Main|Le Mans Classic}}\nStarting in 2002, the \"[[Le Mans Classic]]\" has been held as a biennial event on the full {{convert|13|km|adj=on|abbr=on}} circuit in July. The races take place over a full 24-hour day/night cycle, with starts on set times allowing cars from the same era to compete at the same time. A team typically consists of a car in each class, and the team with the most points accumulated over five or six classes is declared the overall winner. The classes are based on the era in which the cars would have competed. The exact class requirements are re-evaluated for every event, since for each event, the age for the youngest entries is shifted by two years. In the first event, five classes ran more short races; later events have featured six classes running fewer but longer races. Drivers are required to have an FIA International Competition license. This event also includes a large Concours d'Elegance and auction.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books|Endurance motor racing}}\n*[[24 Hours of Le Mans (motorcycle race)]]\n*[[24 Hours of LeMons]]\n*[[Endurance racing (motorsport)|Endurance racing]]\n*[[Le Mans 24 Hours video games]]\n*[[List of 24 Hours of Le Mans winners]]\n*[[List of 24 hours of Le Mans records]]\n*[[Triple Crown of Motorsport]]\n*[[Radio Le Mans]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Additional references==\n* {{in lang|fr}} Le Mans 1965 in Automobile Historique n\u00b048 May 2005\n* {{in lang|fr}} 24 heures du Mans 1973 in Automobile Historique n\u00b049 June/July 2005\n\n==External links==\n{{commons|24 Heures du Mans}}\n* [http://www.24h-lemans.com/en/ Le Mans official website]\n* [http://www.racingsportscars.com/photo_lemans.html Racing Sports Cars] \u2013 historical photos and results\n* [http://www.lemans-history.com Le Mans History] \u2013 The History of Le Mans 24 Hours race\n* [http://www.les24heures.fr 24h of Le Mans History and database]\n\n{{24 Hours of Le Mans}}\n{{24 Hours of Le Mans winners}}\n{{FIA World Endurance Championship races}}\n{{Automobile endurance races}}\n{{Coord|47|56|30|N|0|13|30|E|region:FR-72_type:landmark|display=title}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2013}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:24 Hours Of Le Mans}}\n[[Category:24 Hours of Le Mans| ]]\n[[Category:Sarthe]]\n[[Category:Recurring events established in 1923]]\n[[Category:Group C]]\n[[Category:World Sportscar Championship races|Le Mans]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Sarthe]]\n[[Category:1923 establishments in France]]\n", "name_user": "Chingwakabungya", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSince 2014", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_Hours_of_Le_Mans"}

Competency-based programs measure acquired skills and learning rather than time on task. Students progress through courses as soon as they can prove they\u2019ve mastered the material, rather than advancing only when the semester or term ends. Competency-based programs allow students to demonstrate through multiple writing-based or test-based assessments that they have acquired the set of competencies (levels of knowledge, skill, or ability) required to pass specific course within their degree program.  Additionally, WGU competencies are geared toward understanding the course material at a level equivalent to a 3.0 (on a 4.0) scale. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Registration-Student-Records/Grading-System/ta-p/59 |website=wgu grading system}}</ref> In some ways this makes it more difficult than a traditional college, because most universities allow for passing a course and receiving credit with as little as a 2.0 GPA level of understanding. \n \nWGU was one of the first accredited schools to use the competency-based approach. Former [[United States Department of Education]] Secretary [[Arne Duncan]] has stated, \"While such programs [like WGU] are now the exception, I want them to be the norm.\".<ref>{{cite newspaper |last=Lewin |first=Tamar |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/30/education/duncan-calls-for-urgency-in-lowering-college-costs.html?_r=3& |title=Official Calls for Urgency on College Costs |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 29, 2011 |access-date=April 27, 2018}}</ref> Following WGU's approach, other universities have added there own competency based degree programs.  These include [[Brandman University]] (part of the Chapman University system)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://catalog.brandman.edu/academic-policies-procedures/graduate-competency-based-academic-policies-procedures/ |website=Brandman University Academic Catalog}}</ref> , [[Purdue University Global|Purdue Univesity Global Campus]] (part of the [[Purdue University System]]) <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.purdueglobal.edu/student-experience/personalized-learning/ |website=PG ExcelTrack}}</ref>and the [[University of Wisconsin System]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://flex.wisconsin.edu/ |website=UW Flexible Option}}</ref>\n\nAll aspects of learning (with the exception of demonstration teaching for teacher licensure programs and clinical experiences in the pre-licensure program for nurses) are completed entirely online. The university states that \"learning resources come in a variety of forms, including textbooks, web-based tutorials, simulations, [and] online classes.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wgu.edu/student-experience/life |title=Student Experience |website=WGU official website |date= |access-date=February 13, 2012}}</ref> The university provides all course materials and (online) textbooks through licensing agreements with major commercial providers such as [[Pearson plc|Pearson]] and [[McGraw-Hill]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Kolowich |first=Steve |title=Model of the Moment |url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/05/09/western_governors_university_and_online_competency_based_learning_model_gain_traction |work=[[Inside Higher Ed]] |date=May 9, 2011 |access-date=April 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Assessments====\n[[Image:WGUUtah.jpg|thumb|300px|Western Governors University Administration Building in May 2013]]\nThe university assesses students using '''performance-based''' and '''objective''' assessments.\n\n'''Performance-based assessments''' are normally completed by submitting written assignments. Submissions are checked for academic integrity using the online plagiarism checker [[Unicheck]] by comparing them to a database of other documents submitted to WGU and other universities and other resources available online. Students are graded on their level of competency by comparing the submitted work to a [[Rubric (academic)|rubric]] which describes the standards that the submitted work must meet.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Assessment-Services/Performance-Assessment-Scoring-Policy-and-Rubrics/ta-p/188 |date=February 15, 2016|title=Performance Assessment Scoring Policy and Rubrics |work=WGU official website |access-date=January 28, 2019}}</ref> A student can only pass a performance-based assessment by achieving a \"competent\" score on each rubric point.\n\n'''Objective assessments''' usually consist of exams created by the university which contain multiple-choice, multiple-answer, true-false and/or matching questions.<ref name=\"Objective Assessments - Definition\">{{cite web |url=https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Assessment-Services/WGU-Assessment-Policies/ta-p/133#oadefinition |date=February 15, 2016|title=Objective Assessments - Definition |work=WGU official website |access-date=January 28, 2019}}</ref> Exams are taken online and are monitored by an [[Proctor#Online Proctoring|online proctoring]] service such as ProctorU or Examity using a university-provided [[webcam]] and screen sharing software.

Competency-based programs measure acquired skills and learning rather than time on task. Students progress through courses as soon as they can prove they\u2019ve mastered the material, rather than advancing only when the semester or term ends. Competency-based programs allow students to demonstrate through multiple writing-based or test-based assessments that they have acquired the set of competencies (levels of knowledge, skill, or ability) required to pass specific course within their degree program.  Additionally, WGU competencies are geared toward understanding the course material at a level equivalent to a 3.0 (on a 4.0) scale. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Registration-Student-Records/Grading-System/ta-p/59 |website=wgu grading system}}</ref> In some ways this makes it more difficult than a traditional college.  Most universities allow for passing a course, and receiving credit with as little as a 2.0 GPA level of understanding. \n \nWGU was one of the first accredited schools to use the competency-based approach. Former [[United States Department of Education]] Secretary [[Arne Duncan]] has stated, \"While such programs [like WGU] are now the exception, I want them to be the norm.\".<ref>{{cite newspaper |last=Lewin |first=Tamar |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/30/education/duncan-calls-for-urgency-in-lowering-college-costs.html?_r=3& |title=Official Calls for Urgency on College Costs |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 29, 2011 |access-date=April 27, 2018}}</ref> Following WGU's approach, other universities have added there own competency based degree programs.  These include [[Brandman University]] (part of the Chapman University system)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://catalog.brandman.edu/academic-policies-procedures/graduate-competency-based-academic-policies-procedures/ |website=Brandman University Academic Catalog}}</ref> , [[Purdue University Global|Purdue Univesity Global Campus]] (part of the [[Purdue University System]]) <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.purdueglobal.edu/student-experience/personalized-learning/ |website=PG ExcelTrack}}</ref>and the [[University of Wisconsin System]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://flex.wisconsin.edu/ |website=UW Flexible Option}}</ref>\n\nAll aspects of learning (with the exception of demonstration teaching for teacher licensure programs and clinical experiences in the pre-licensure program for nurses) are completed entirely online. The university states that \"learning resources come in a variety of forms, including textbooks, web-based tutorials, simulations, [and] online classes.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wgu.edu/student-experience/life |title=Student Experience |website=WGU official website |date= |access-date=February 13, 2012}}</ref> The university provides all course materials and (online) textbooks through licensing agreements with major commercial providers such as [[Pearson plc|Pearson]] and [[McGraw-Hill]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Kolowich |first=Steve |title=Model of the Moment |url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/05/09/western_governors_university_and_online_competency_based_learning_model_gain_traction |work=[[Inside Higher Ed]] |date=May 9, 2011 |access-date=April 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Assessments====\n[[Image:WGUUtah.jpg|thumb|300px|Western Governors University Administration Building in May 2013]]\nThe university assesses students using '''performance-based''' and '''objective''' assessments.\n\n'''Performance-based assessments''' are normally completed by submitting written assignments. Submissions are checked for academic integrity using the online plagiarism checker [[Unicheck]] by comparing them to a database of other documents submitted to WGU and other universities and other resources available online. Students are graded on their level of competency by comparing the submitted work to a [[Rubric (academic)|rubric]] which describes the standards that the submitted work must meet.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Assessment-Services/Performance-Assessment-Scoring-Policy-and-Rubrics/ta-p/188 |date=February 15, 2016|title=Performance Assessment Scoring Policy and Rubrics |work=WGU official website |access-date=January 28, 2019}}</ref> A student can only pass a performance-based assessment by achieving a \"competent\" score on each rubric point.\n\n'''Objective assessments''' usually consist of exams created by the university which contain multiple-choice, multiple-answer, true-false and/or matching questions.<ref name=\"Objective Assessments - Definition\">{{cite web |url=https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Assessment-Services/WGU-Assessment-Policies/ta-p/133#oadefinition |date=February 15, 2016|title=Objective Assessments - Definition |work=WGU official website |access-date=January 28, 2019}}</ref> Exams are taken online and are monitored by an [[Proctor#Online Proctoring|online proctoring]] service such as ProctorU or Examity using a university-provided [[webcam]] and screen sharing software.

University-created exams can only be passed by achieving a minimum overall grade that demonstrates competency in the course,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Assessment-Services/WGU-Assessment-Policies/ta-p/133#oaresults |date=February 15, 2016|title=Objective Assessment Results Policy |work=WGU official website |access-date=January 28, 2019}}</ref> while professional certification exams have their own grading methodology and passing score set by their governing body.\n\nThere are no [[test (assessment)|open-book]] or unproctored exams.<ref name=\"Objective Assessments - Definition\"/>\n\n===Admissions===\nWGU has a multi-step admissions process.

The school does not require [[SAT]] or [[ACT (test)|ACT]] scores for undergraduate admission. Undergraduate programs require the student to possess a [[high school diploma]] or [[GED]] and pass the school's Collegiate Readiness Assessment, and admission into all programs requires an interview with a WGU enrollment counselor to determine whether the competency-based approach is appropriate for the student.<ref name=Admissions>{{cite web |url=https://www.wgu.edu/admissions.html |title=Admissions |date=November 12, 2008 |work=WGU official website |access-date=December 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Historical Enrollment===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| '''Enrollment by Year'''\n| '''Total Students<ref name=AnnualReport2018/>'''\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| 2018\n| 110,534\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| 2017\n| 91,436\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| 2016\n| 76,722\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| 2015\n| 63,964\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| 2014\n| 53,853\n|}\n\n===Graduation rate===\nThe U.S. Department of Education College Scorecard lists the graduation rate at WGU as 42% <ref>{{cite web |url=https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/search/?id=433387&name=Western%20Governors%20University&page=0&sort=completion_rate:desc |title=College Scorecard \u2013 Western Governors University |website=[[U.S. Dept of Education College Scorecard]] |access-date=March 8, 2020}</ref>.

It is headquartered in Melbourne. It has a growing e-commerce retail presence in Australia and is considered a multi-channel department store retailer.\n\nFounded in 1849, Harris Scarfe currently operates 66 retail stores nationally in two formats including \"Harris Scarfe\" [[department stores]] and \"Harris Scarfe Home\" homewares and kitchenware stores.\n\nIn December 2019, Harris Scarfe entered into voluntary administration after 170 years in operation. {{as of|2020|1}}, 21 of its 65 stores are set to close.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nHarris Scarfe traces its history to 10 February 1849, when the founding partners, George Peter Harris and John C. Lanyon, arrived in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]] on the ship, \"Candahar\", to establish a hardware and [[ironmonger]]y business. Lanyon left the partnership on 22 February 1855 and returned to London, where he subsequently opened up a buying house for Geo. P Harris and other businesses in South Australia. Additional partners, George Scarfe and Richard Smith, joined the business in 1866 and the business name \"Geo. P. Harris, Scarfe & Co.\" was adopted in December that year.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article207681585 |title=Advertising |newspaper=[[The Adelaide Express]] |volume=IV |issue=914 |location=South Australia |date=17 December 1866 |accessdate=22 October 2018 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nHarris Scarfe grew to become a major supplier of a broad range of household, agricultural and industrial items.  Besides conducting its retailing businesses, Harris Scarfe manufactured leather goods, including saddlery and luggage, as part of a wholesaling operation. Notably, during [[World War II]], when the [[Australian Government]] enforced price controls, it used the Harris Scarfe catalogue as the price guide.\n\n===1970s - 1980s===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\nIn 1971, Baradeen Quest Pty Limited, a subsidiary of Investment and Merchant Finance Corporation Limited (\"IMFC\") made a successful takeover bid for Harris Scarfe Limited, which was listed on the [[Australian Stock Exchange]] at the time.\n\n[[Charles Davis Limited]], a listed [[Tasmania]]n company controlled by [[Sir Donald Trescowthick]], acquired control of Harris Scarfe in 1976. Trescowthick focussed Harris Scarfe's activities on its retailing business, developing a full line department store model, while the industrial products outlet at [[Mile End, South Australia|Mile End]] evolved to become Harry's, a large hardware retailing business.\n\nThe success of Harry's led Harris Scarfe's parent company, Charles Davis Limited, to acquire other hardware retailers, including Lloyd's in South Australia, [[Campbell's]] in Queensland, and [[Bunnings Warehouse|McEwans]] in Victoria and New South Wales. In 1989, these hardware businesses were sold in a management buyout, and acquired by [[Bunnings]] in 1993.\n\n===1990s===\nIn the 1990s, Harris Scarfe entered an era of unprecedented national growth. It expanded beyond its large department store in Rundle Mall into smaller format suburban and regional shopping stores. Harris Scarfe also acquired full-line department store sites from other retailers who were rationalising their store networks including [[David Jones Limited|David Jones]], [[Myer]], John Martins, Stirling and Centre Fair. By 1995, Harris Scarfe had become Australia's third largest department store retailer, with 38 stores, and trading in all states of Australia.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe company ran into trouble during the late 1990s due to rising debts and management issues.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} In April 2001, the business was placed in receivership. Unsecured creditors were owed $93 million, and the company was $50 million in debt.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/former-harris-scarfe-executive-jailed-six-years-20020627-gduc7w.html|title=Former Harris Scarfe executive jailed six years|date=27 June 2002|work=[[The Age]]|access-date=29 December 2019|url-status=live|agency=[[Australian Associated Press]]}}</ref> In June 2002, the company's former chief financial officer, Alan Hodgson, was sentenced to six years in jail, on multiple counts that included giving false information to the [[Australian Securities Exchange|ASX]], and failing to act honestly as a company officer.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2001, Harris Scarfe listed on the [[Australian Securities Exchange]] (ASX). In the same year, the company fell $160 million into debt, resulting in the owners, the Trescowthick family, losing $31.5 million. The government initially considered pressing charges against chairman Adam Trescowthick, but later dropped the case.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn 2002, the company started a revitalisation program. The store network was remodelled with new products, layouts and new branding. As a result, Harris Scarfe soon began to enjoy record growth. By 2007, Sydney-based Momentum Private Equity acquired an $80&nbsp;million majority stake in the company. During 2012, Momentum Corporate ten sold the business to [[Pepkor]], a South African private equity firm.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nOver a six-month period at the end of 2003, Harris Scarfe made certain representations on a number of items in its catalogues in relation to pricing. Harris Scarfe admitted to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) that representations in its promotional advertising may have misled consumers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/harris-scarfe-admits-sale-prices-may-have-misled-issues-public-apology|title=Harris Scarfe admits sale prices may have misled, issues public apology|last=Commission|first=Australian Competition and Consumer|date=2013-02-23|website=Australian Competition and Consumer Commission|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> \n\nAgain in 2007 Harris Scarfe was investigated by the Australian consumer watchdog who sued the department store in the Australian Federal Court over allegedly false promotions for its sales in October 2006. The ACCC alleged that the advertising was misleading because Harris Scarfe was not offering what it advertised:\n\n# A discount off all goods in its stores.\n# A minimum of 20% off all goods in its stores.\n\nThe ACCC also alleged that the catalogue included images of products under banners stating a specific discount when some of those goods were not discounted by the stated percentage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smartcompany.com.au/marketing/advertising/accc-challenges-harris-scarfe-ads/|title=ACCC challenges Harris Scarfe ads|date=2007-10-12|website=SmartCompany|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, the Federal Court, Adelaide has declared that Harris Scarfe Australia Pty Ltd misled consumers by representing in a catalogue that certain advertised items were discounted by a specific amount when in fact they were discounted by less than that amount, or were not discounted at all.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/court-declares-harris-scarfe-misled-consumers|title=Court declares Harris Scarfe misled consumers|last=Commission|first=Australian Competition and Consumer|date=2013-02-23|website=Australian Competition and Consumer Commission|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2014, Greenlit Brands, formerly [[Steinhoff International|Steinhoff Asia Pacific]], acquired [[Pepkor]] and this included Harris Scarfe.

The collection comprises a range of contemporary women's fashion, accessories, bed and bath collections and home fragrances.\n\nHarris Scarfe's home brand 'Bulls Head' Jeans were found to have harmful Azo dyes, which expert authorities classify as carcinogens.

It is headquartered in Melbourne. It has a growing e-commerce retail presence in Australia and is considered a multi-channel department store retailer.\n\nFounded in 1849, Harris Scarfe currently operates 66 retail stores nationally in two formats including \"Harris Scarfe\" [[department stores]] and \"Harris Scarfe Home\" homewares and kitchenware stores.\n\nIn December 2019, Harris Scarfe entered into voluntary administration after 170 years in operation. {{as of|2020|1}}, 21 of its 65 stores are set to close.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nHarris Scarfe traces its history to 10 February 1849, when the founding partners, George Peter Harris and John C. Lanyon, arrived in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]] on the ship, \"Candahar\", to establish a hardware and [[ironmonger]]y business. Lanyon left the partnership on 22 February 1855 and returned to London, where he subsequently opened up a buying house for Geo. P Harris and other businesses in South Australia. Additional partners, George Scarfe and Richard Smith, joined the business in 1866 and the business name \"Geo. P. Harris, Scarfe & Co.\" was adopted in December that year.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article207681585 |title=Advertising |newspaper=[[The Adelaide Express]] |volume=IV |issue=914 |location=South Australia |date=17 December 1866 |accessdate=22 October 2018 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nHarris Scarfe grew to become a major supplier of a broad range of household, agricultural and industrial items.  Besides conducting its retailing businesses, Harris Scarfe manufactured leather goods, including saddlery and luggage, as part of a wholesaling operation. Notably, during [[World War II]], when the [[Australian Government]] enforced price controls, it used the Harris Scarfe catalogue as the price guide.\n\n===1970s - 1980s===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\nIn 1971, Baradeen Quest Pty Limited, a subsidiary of Investment and Merchant Finance Corporation Limited (\"IMFC\") made a successful takeover bid for Harris Scarfe Limited, which was listed on the [[Australian Stock Exchange]] at the time.\n\n[[Charles Davis Limited]], a listed [[Tasmania]]n company controlled by [[Sir Donald Trescowthick]], acquired control of Harris Scarfe in 1976. Trescowthick focussed Harris Scarfe's activities on its retailing business, developing a full line department store model, while the industrial products outlet at [[Mile End, South Australia|Mile End]] evolved to become Harry's, a large hardware retailing business.\n\nThe success of Harry's led Harris Scarfe's parent company, Charles Davis Limited, to acquire other hardware retailers, including Lloyd's in South Australia, [[Campbell's]] in Queensland, and [[Bunnings Warehouse|McEwans]] in Victoria and New South Wales. In 1989, these hardware businesses were sold in a management buyout, and acquired by [[Bunnings]] in 1993.\n\n===1990s===\nIn the 1990s, Harris Scarfe entered an era of unprecedented national growth. It expanded beyond its large department store in Rundle Mall into smaller format suburban and regional shopping stores. Harris Scarfe also acquired full-line department store sites from other retailers who were rationalising their store networks including [[David Jones Limited|David Jones]], [[Myer]], John Martins, Stirling and Centre Fair. By 1995, Harris Scarfe had become Australia's third largest department store retailer, with 38 stores, and trading in all states of Australia.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe company ran into trouble during the late 1990s due to rising debts and management issues.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} In April 2001, the business was placed in receivership.

In the same year, the company fell $160 million into debt, resulting in the owners, the Trescowthick family, losing $31.5 million. The government initially considered pressing charges against chairman Adam Trescowthick, but later dropped the case.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn 2002, the company started a revitalisation program. The store network was remodelled with new products, layouts and new branding. As a result, Harris Scarfe soon began to enjoy record growth. By 2007, Sydney-based Momentum Private Equity acquired an $80&nbsp;million majority stake in the company. During 2012, Momentum Corporate ten sold the business to [[Pepkor]], a South African private equity firm.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAs of 2014, Greenlit Brands, formerly [[Steinhoff International|Steinhoff Asia Pacific]], acquired [[Pepkor]] and this included Harris Scarfe.

In 1979-80, 5 million domestic and international passengers flew into and out of Santa Cruz compared with 3&nbsp;million at Delhi's Palam Airport. The airlines were constantly expanding their services but there was no corresponding increase in space at the terminal, making it the most congested airport in the country.

The Santa Cruz terminal was to be used for domestic traffic alone. The International Airport Authority of India (IAAI), which was set up in 1972, started planning the construction of a new terminal building for handling international passenger traffic, to be completed by 1981. Accordingly, construction of the new International terminal at Sahar to the north-east of Santacruz in Andheri was taken up at an estimated cost of {{INR}} 110&nbsp;million.\nConstruction of the new international terminal at Sahar began in November 1977, and the first phase took three years to build. Sahar Terminal 2A, the first phase of the three-part terminal, was opened on 5 December 1980.<ref name=\"ITA1\"/>\n\nAAI had been considering the modernisation of Mumbai airport in 1996 although the AAI board approved a modernisation proposal only in 2003. By then, Mumbai and Delhi airports were handling 38% of the country's aircraft movement and generating one-third of all revenues earned by AAI. At that time, the Mumbai airport handled 13.3&nbsp;million passengers, 60% of which were domestic travellers. The airport faced severe congestion for both aircraft and passengers as it was handling twice as many aircraft movements per day than it was originally designed for. The bidding process for its modernisation eventually began in May 2004 with the decision by the Empowered Group of Ministers (EGoM) was announced in January 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://115.111.81.83:8080/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/233/2007-05-01_RekhaJain.pdf |title=Airport Privatization in India: Lessons from the Bidding Process in Delhi and Mumbai |author1=Rekha Jain |author2=G.

In 1979-80, 5 million domestic and international passengers flew into and out of Santa Cruz compared with 3&nbsp;million at Delhi's Palam Airport. The airlines were constantly expanding their services but there was no corresponding increase in space at the terminal, making it the most congested airport in the country.

The Santa Cruz terminal was to be used for domestic traffic alone. The International Airport Authority of India (IAAI), which was set up in 1972, started planning the construction of a new terminal building for handling international passenger traffic, to be completed by 1981. Accordingly, construction of the new International terminal at Sahar to the north-east of Santacruz in Andheri was taken up at an estimated cost of {{INR}} 110&nbsp;million.\nConstruction of the new international terminal at Sahar began in November 1977, and the first phase took three years to build. Sahar Terminal 2A, the first phase of the three-part terminal, was opened on 5 December 1980.<ref name=\"ITA1\"/>\n\nAAI had been considering the modernisation of Mumbai airport in 1996 although the AAI board approved a modernisation proposal only in 2003. By then, Mumbai and Delhi airports were handling 38% of the country's aircraft movement and generating one-third of all revenues earned by AAI. At that time, the Mumbai airport handled 13.3&nbsp;million passengers, 60% of which were domestic travellers. The airport faced severe congestion for both aircraft and passengers as it was handling twice as many aircraft movements per day than it was originally designed for. The bidding process for its modernisation eventually began in May 2004 with the decision by the Empowered Group of Ministers (EGoM) was announced in January 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://115.111.81.83:8080/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/233/2007-05-01_RekhaJain.pdf |title=Airport Privatization in India: Lessons from the Bidding Process in Delhi and Mumbai |author1=Rekha Jain |author2=G.
