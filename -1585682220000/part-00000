The city's registered population was 26,468 in the 2011 census, with a total of 27,683 in the municipality.<ref name=\"census2011\"/>\n\n==Name==\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2011}}\nThe name ''Vukovar'' means 'town on the [[Vuka (river)|Vuka River]]' (''Vuko'' from the Vuka River, and ''v\u00e1r'' from the [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] word for 'fortress'). The river was called \"Ulca\" in antiquity, probably from an Illyrian language.

In other languages, the city in German is known as ''Wukowar'' and in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] as ''Vukov\u00e1r'' or ''Valk\u00f3v\u00e1r''. In the late 17th century, the medieval Croatian name Vukovo was supplanted by the Hungarian ''Vukov\u00e1r''.<ref>Treasures of Yugoslavia, p.249.</ref>\n\n==Municipal area==\n\nThe administrative municipal area of the city contains the following settlements:<ref name=\"census2011\"/>\n* [[Grabovo, Croatia|Grabovo]], population 47\n* [[Lipova\u010da, Vukovar-Syrmia County|Lipova\u010da]], population 386\n* [[Sotin]], population 782\n* Vukovar, population 26,468\n\nIn [[SFR Yugoslavia]], the municipalities were generally larger, and the Vukovar municipality spanned the region from [[Vera, Croatia|Vera]] and [[Borovo, Croatia|Borovo]] in the north, [[Ilok]] in the east and [[Tovarnik]] in the south, but it has since been divided into several municipalities.\n\nHistorically, Vukovar was divided into the Old Vukovar, New Vukovar and former workers' Bata village with [[Bata Shoes]] (now Borovo) factory, today known as the Vukovar suburb Borovo Naselje.\n[[File:ZGvucdove.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Vu\u010dedol Culture|Vu\u010dedol Dove, historical symbol of the Vukovar]].]]\n\n==Geography==\nVukovar is located in the Eastern part of the Republic of Croatia and is the centre of the [[Vukovar-Syrmia County]]. Its location places it at the border of historical provinces Eastern [[Slavonia]] and Western [[Syrmia]].\n \nThe city is positioned on important transport routes. Since time immemorial transport routes from the northwest to the southeast were active in the [[Danube]] Valley through the Vukovar area.\n\nAfter steam ships were introduced in the mid-19th century, and with the arrival of present-day tourist ships, Vukovar is connected with Budapest and [[Vienna]] upstream and all the way to [[Romania]] downstream. The Vukovar harbour is an important import and export station. The Danube has always been and remains the connection of the people of Vukovar with [[Europe]] and the world.\n\nVukovar is located {{convert|20|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Vinkovci]] and {{convert|36|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Osijek]], with an elevation of {{convert|108|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.

In the 11th\u201312th century, the region was part of the [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|Kingdom of Croatia]]; from the 13th to 16th century part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]; and between 1526-1687<ref>Treasures of Yugoslavia, published by Yugoslaviapublic, Beograd, available in English, German and Serbo-Croatian, 664 pages, 1980</ref> under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule.\n\nVukovar was mentioned first in the 13th century as ''Volko'', ''Walk'', ''Wolkov'' (original Croatian/Slavic name of the town was ''Vukovo''). In 1231, Vukovo obtained its first privileges and later the right to levy taxes on passages along the Danube and the Vuka.<ref>Treasures of Yugoslavia, p.249</ref> During administration of the medieval [[Kingdom of Hungary]], the town was a seat of Valk\u00f3 (Croatian: Vuka) county, which was located between the [[Drava]] and [[Sava]] rivers, while during Ottoman administration it was part of the [[Sanjak of Syrmia]]. At the end of the 17th century, the town's population numbered about 3,000 inhabitants.\n\n===Habsburg Monarchy and Yugoslavia===\n[[File:Pozdrav_iz_Vukovara_1912.jpg|thumb|left|Vukovar in the Early 20th century]]\nAfter the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] in 1699, Vukovar was part of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], [[Slavonia]] ([[Transleithania]] after the [[compromise of 1867]]), and soon after in the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]], created when the [[Kingdom of Slavonia]] and the Kingdom of Croatia were merged in 1868.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, Vukovar was the seat of [[Syrmia County]] of the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]].\n\nIn 1918, Vukovar became part of the newly formed [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]] ([[Yugoslavia]] in 1929). Between 1918 and 1922, Vukovar was the administrative seat of the county of Syrmia (Srijem), and between 1922 and 1929 it was the administrative seat of Syrmia oblast. After 1929, Vukovar was part of the [[Sava Banovina]], and beginning in 1939 it was part of the [[Banovina of Croatia]]. Between 1941 and 1944, Vukovar was part of the [[Independent State of Croatia]]. During [[World War II]] the city was bombed by the Allies. In 2008 an unexploded bomb was found in the city from this period.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vktel.com/v/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1363&Itemid=40 |title=Bombs from the II World War found in Vukovar |publisher=vktel.com |accessdate=18 November 2010 |language=hr |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129153637/http://www.vktel.com/v/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1363&Itemid=40 |archivedate=29 November 2010  }}</ref> From 1945, it was part of the People's Republic of Croatia within the new [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]].\nAfter the creation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and in the wake of communism gaining popularity throughout Europe, Vukovar became the location where in 1920 the Socialist Labor Party of Yugoslavia (Communists) (''Socijalisti\u010dka radni\u010dka partija Jugoslavije - komunista'') was renamed the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] (''Komunisti\u010dka partija Jugoslavije'').\n\n===Croatian War of Independence===\n{{Main|Battle of Vukovar|Vukovar massacre}}\n[[File:Vukovar.jpg|right|thumb|Vukovar in [[Austria-Hungary]], [[Franz Joseph I]] street]]\n\nVukovar was heavily damaged during the [[Croatian War of Independence]].

Vukovar's population was ethnically mixed and had 28 ethnic groups before the war. Since the boundaries of the municipality have changed a few times, there are significant differences in the population census between '61 and '71, and '91 and '01.\n\nParticularly since the war in Croatia, much of the native Croat population has moved to other areas of Croatia or emigrated to Western Europe (notably Germany or [[Austria]]) and many Serbs have either moved to [[Serbia]] or to Canada and Western Europe.\n\nFifteen years after the war, in 2006, the city's ethnic makeup showed equal percentages of Croat and Serb residents.<ref>[http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes-article.php?mm=11&dd=18&yyyy=2006 Vukovar: Day of remembrance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113011259/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes-article.php?mm=11&dd=18&yyyy=2006 |date=13 November 2010 }}, B92, 18 November 2006.

Filipa i Jakova u Vukovaru.jpg|thumb|left|Franciscan monastery with [[Church of Saints Philip and James, Vukovar|Church of Saints Philip and James]]]]\nAmong a number of attractive buildings, severely damaged in the recent war, the most interesting are the [[Eltz Manor]] of the [[Eltz]] noble family from the 18th century, [[Baroque]] buildings in the centre of the town, the [[Franciscan]] monastery with the [[Church of Saints Philip and James, Vukovar|parish church of Sts. Philip and James]], the [[Vukovar water tower|water tower]], the birth house of [[Nobel prize]] winner [[Lavoslav Ru\u017ei\u010dka]], the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] [[Church of St Nicholas, Vukovar|church of St Nicholas]], the [[palace of Syrmia County]] etc. Since the peaceful reintegration under Croatian control in 1998, many buildings have been rebuilt, but there are many ruins still in the town.\n\nOutside the town, on the banks of the [[Danube]] toward [[Ilok]], lies a notable archaeological site, [[Vucedol|Vu\u010dedol]]. The ritual vessel called the [[Vucedol Dove|Vu\u010dedol Dove]] (''vu\u010dedolska golubica'') is considered the symbol of Vukovar. Vu\u010dedol is also a well-known excursion destination, frequented by anglers and bathers, especially the beautiful sand beach on ''Orlov Otok'' (Eagle's Island).\n\n[[Vukovar Synagogue]] was built in 1889, and was devastated by the Nazis in 1941.

The museum started in the Coach Post Building in the old [[baroque]] centre, but was moved to [[Eltz Manor|Castle Eltz]] in 1966. Up until 1991 the museum had about 50 thousand exhibits in four separate divisions:\n\nThe Heritage Museum displayed the history of Vukovar from prehistory to modern times and some of its most important collections included the items excavated at the [[archaeological site]] Vu\u010dedol and the Culture and History Collection, which contained documents, furniture, and pieces of art, and provided an authentic display of the life of the citizens of Vukovar and the [[Eltz]] family.\n\nThe Bauer Collection contained the most complete overview of modern [[Croatia]]n art from the end of the 19th and the early 20th century with special emphasis on the period between the two world wars. Among more than one thousand pieces of art the Collection contained the works of [[Vlaho Bukovac]] , [[Mato Celestin Medovi\u0107]] , Ico Kr\u0161njavi, [[Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107]] , Fran Kr\u0161ini\u0107 , [[Emanuel Vidovi\u0107]] , and many others.\n\nMemorial Museum of the [[Lavoslav Ru\u017ei\u010dka|Nobel Prize Winner Lavoslav Ru\u017ei\u010dka]], located in the house where he was born, it displayed original documents and medals from the life and work of the famous Nobel Prize winner, who received this prestigious award in 1939 for [[chemistry]].\n\nMemorial Museum of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|2nd Congress of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] was located in the Workers' Hall building, former Grand Hotel, where the congress was held in 1920. The materials connected to the development of the [[labour movement]] and the founding of the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] was exhibited and presented here.\n[[File:Vucedol Culture Museum.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vu\u010dedol Culture Museum]].]]\n\nDuring [[Croatian War of Independence]], Castle [[Eltz]] suffered significant damage and the collections which were kept there were also damaged: some of the exhibits were completely destroyed, some have disappeared and cannot be recovered, and some of them were taken to [[Serbia]]. After years of effort and diplomatic activity by the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of [[Croatia]] that part of the collection was returned to Vukovar on 13 December 2001. In the period from 1991 to 1997 the Vukovar City Museum was operating in the [[Mimara Museum]] in [[Zagreb]].\n\nNear the end of 1992 a collection was founded with the name Vukovar Museum in Exile which began the creation of a collection of donations by Croatian, and soon after also European, artists for the City of Vukovar. To this day that collection has gathered over 1400 pieces of modern Croatian and [[Art of Europe|European art]]. This collection represented the beginning of the cultural restoration of Vukovar and it is displayed at the restored Castle [[Eltz]] today, along with other museum collections which are part of the permanent collection of the museum.\n\nNow that it is renovated, the Castle Eltz complex represents a unique museum and [[Art gallery|gallery]] , science, and [[multimedia]] centre, which preserves and presents [[cultural heritage]] as an element of [[national identity]] and the continuity of life in this area.\n\nIn 2013 the Vukovar City Museum won a prestigious Anton \u0160tifani\u0107 Award for special contributions to the development of tourism in the Republic of Croatia and in 2014 won the Simply the Best award.\n\n===Vu\u010dedol Culture Museum===\n[[File:Radni\u010dki dom u Vukovaru.JPG|thumb|right|Radnicki dom (The Workers' Hall) known originally as the Grand Hotel is one of Vukovar's most familiar architectural landmarks]]\n[[Vu\u010dedol Culture Museum]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waytocroatia.hr/en/component/k2/vukovar-home-of-the-vucedol-dove.html|title=Vukovar \u2013 Home of the Vu\u010dedol Dove \u2013 Way to Croatia|work=waytocroatia.hr}}</ref> is open on the tenth of June 2015.

In addition to the specificity and uniqueness which the museum is drawing from its contents, the attractiveness of the museum is guaranteed by its location and [[architectural design]].\n\nNamely, the museum is positioned on one side almost at the very [[Danube]] riverbank and on the other side, on four floors, in the hill, while its flat green roof is a [[promenade]] which leads to the archaeological site. As for the content, the permanent exhibition is displayed in 19 rooms on almost 1200 square metres. In addition to using state of the art technologies, multimedia and interactive content, the way of life on Vu\u010dedol culture localities, spreading through 12 European countries, is displayed.\n\n==Events==\n[[File:Vukovar-watertower-after-war.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vukovar water tower]], one of the national symbols of [[Croatian War of Independence]]]]\nIn Vukovar during the year there are many cultural events. Certainly the most important is the Danube region [[Vukovar Film Festival]].\n*The [[Vukovar Film Festival]] is unique due to many things. It is the only film festival of the community of [[Danube]] region countries and the only one held literally on the Danube. It is designed to promote and spread the creative development of [[filmmakers]] from the region and it is organised with the intent to contribute to cultural [[Building restoration|restoration]] in the city destroyed in the [[Croatian War of Independence|Homeland War]]. The theme of the festival, the films from the Danube region countries, is logically connected to Vukovar as a centre of the Croatian part of the community of the Danube region. Cultural influences have always spread along the Danube. Since the Vukovar film festival is the only film festival focused on this region, on the international level it seeks to connect filmmakers from the Danube region countries, whose film making industries are some of the most vital in the world.\n*The Vukovar [[Chamber music]] Festival is held in the first half of June at the area of Castle [[Eltz Manor|Eltz]], the Chapel of Saint Rok, and the [[Church of Saints Philip and James, Vukovar|Church of Saint Filip and Jakov in Vukovar]], and it traditionally starts with a concert by the [[Zagreb Philharmonic Orchestra]]. The guests of the festival are solo performers and [[chamber music|chamber]] ensembles from [[Croatia]] and Europe.\n*The [[Vukovar Puppet Spring Festival]] was founded in 1996 as a national theatre conference. There are around 15 puppet theatres performing every year and in the five days of the festival they give around 100 performances in the towns and municipalities of Vukovarsko-Srijemska County. The centre of the festival is the town of Vukovar where 16 performances are played and where various workshops and an awards ceremony are held (for the award for life achievement in contribution to Croatian puppetry). The festival is held at the same time every year, the week before the [[Holy Week]] before [[Easter]]. In 2011 there were 16 puppet theatres from [[Croatia]] and abroad ([[P\u00e9cs|Pecs]], [[Mostar]]) that participated the festival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.assitej-international.org/festival/vukovar-puppets-spring-2/|title=Vukovar puppets spring - Assitej International|website=www.assitej-international.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://vinkovci.com.hr/vinkovci/hrvatska/na-lutkarsko-proljece-dolaze-84-predstave|title=Na Lutkarsko prolje\u0107e dolaze 84 predstave, Vinkovci|website=Portal Vinkovci|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref>\n[[File:Vukovar_City_Centre.jpg|thumb|right|Old baroque city centre]]\n*[[Vincent of Saragossa|Saint Vinko's Day]] in Vu\u010dedol is an event held traditionally every year on 22 January at the Goldschmidt farm grounds. This event marks the beginning of the year's work in the [[vineyards]] and it starts with a blessing of the vineyards. Sausages and other cured meat products are hung on the vines, because of a tradition that by hanging large sausages on the vines, the grape vines will be more fruitful and the grape clusters will be large. The same legend claims that if on that day, before noon, icicles or snow melts and creates puddles in which a sparrow can bathe, the year will be fruitful and there will be so much wine that people can bathe in it. Along with an accompanying culture and art programme, this event represents a true vineyard experience, with mulled wine and delicacies that the [[Tourism|visitors]] may taste or prepare for themselves, on the fire.\n*Bonofest is held every year in the middle of May. It is a festival of [[Spiritual (music)|spiritual music]] held in the [[Church of Saints Philip and James, Vukovar|church of Saint Filip and Jakov]]. The two evenings of the festival feature famous musicians as well as lesser known young musicians who were selected by a committee of professionals. Aside from showing the beauty and richness of spiritual music it encourages lyricists and composers to write new material and carries the message about the beauty of faith and the human need for spirituality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turizamvukovar.hr/vukovar_eng.php?stranica=183|title=VUKOVAR TOURIST BOARD - Bonofest|work=turizamvukovar.hr}}</ref>\n*The Ethno fair is organised each year by the Vukovar City Tourist Board and takes place in September in the city centre in the \"Hotel Grand\" building. Various craftsmen, winemakers and other manufacturers sell their handmade products which represent the heritage of this part of Croatia.\n*The Vukovar Advent Festivities start four weeks during Advent during which a series of musical and performance events are organised. Each event is special as the traditional lighting of the candles is performed.\n*Silent night in Vukovar is a traditional Christmas concert of [[Croatian Radiotelevision|Croatian National Television]]. It is held during Vukovar's Advent Festivities in the [[Church of Saints Philip and James, Vukovar|Church of St. Philip and James]]\n*The Christmas Fair is held a couple of days before Christmas.\n\n==Institutions==\nVukovar is the seat of several local organisations and institutions such as [[Vukovar-Srijem County]], [[Polytechnic Lavoslav Ru\u017ei\u010dka Vukovar]], [[Gymnasium Vukovar]], etc. It is also the seat of several organisations and institutions of the Serb minority in Croatia such as the [[Joint Council of Municipalities]], the [[Association for Serbian language and literature in the Republic of Croatia]], the [[Independent Democratic Serb Party]], the [[Party of Danube Serbs]] as well as the seat of the [[Consulate General of Republic of Serbia in Vukovar]].\n[[File:Kompleks vlastelinstva Eltz, \u017dupanijska 03.jpg|thumb|right|\u017dupanija Palace, seat of the [[Vukovar-Srijem County]]]]\n\n==Economy==\n\nVukovar port is situated on {{convert|1335|km|abbr=off}} of the downstream flow of Danube river, on its right coast, and is the biggest official concessioner in the Vukovar region. The Company focuses its business on the transshipment of general and bulk cargo. The Port (850m long and 45m wide) is conveniently situated on the main current of the river, enabling navigation throughout the whole year regardless of water level.\nThe Port recorded productivity growth and increase in cargo transshipment from 123,570 tons in 2009 to 295,199 tons in 2011. The majority of transshipment was in the category of bulk cargo (237,119 tons in 2011), while packaged goods and heavy cargo accounted for a total of 58,080 tons.\n\nThe economy of Vukovar is based on [[agriculture]], [[trade]], [[viticulture]], [[food industry]], [[textile industry]], building materials industry, [[footwear]] industry and [[tourism]]. Vukovar is the largest Croatian town and river port on the [[Danube]]. Its economy is based on trade, farming, [[viticulture]], livestock breeding, textiles, the food-processing industry, the footwear industry and tourism.\n\nHowever, the port infrastructure in Vukovar, only partly reconstructed, still does not meet the requirements of the market. The layout of the port area, particularly the access to railway tracks and the quay operational area, are technologically inappropriate and not compatible with market standards. There is also a lack of warehouse capacity. Altogether, it affects the quality of the service provided in the Port and thus decreases the port competitiveness.<ref>http://www.aik-invest.hr/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/PortVukovarEN.pdf</ref>\n[[File:Borovo bata.jpg|thumb|left|Former industrial town called Bata \u2013 Ville, today's [[Borovo Naselje]]]]\n\nBorovo, a manufacturer of footwear located in Vukovar, ended up devastated and demolished in 1991 during the war.  In its prime it employed 24,000 employees and tried to break into foreign markets with innovations in the manufacture of footwear, but today there are fewer than 1000 employees.\n\nOn 7 June 1931, Borovo was founded by [[Czechs|Czech]] industrialist [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Ba\u0165a]]. Borovo Factory was one of the few famous Bata Shoes factories in the world. In 1933, the production of rubber and technical goods started, and Bata in the gum industry became one of the first companies in the then Kingdom of Yugoslavia.\n\nBetween 1947 and the end of the 1980s, Borovo grew into the largest and most economically most powerful company in the production and sale of footwear and rubber in this part of Europe. Borovo Facory produced more than 20 million pair of [[shoes]] a year, thousands of tons of auto-rubber and rubber-technical goods, 22,000 people were employed at today's factories with more than 600 stores across the country.

The ritual vessel called the [[Vucedol Dove|Vu\u010dedol Dove]] (''vu\u010dedolska golubica'') is considered the symbol of Vukovar. Vu\u010dedol is also a well-known excursion destination, frequented by anglers and bathers, especially the beautiful sand beach on ''Orlov Otok'' (Eagle's Island).\n\n[[Vukovar Synagogue]] was built in 1889, and was devastated by the Nazis in 1941.

The museum started in the Coach Post Building in the old [[baroque]] centre, but was moved to [[Eltz Manor|Castle Eltz]] in 1966. Up until 1991 the museum had about 50 thousand exhibits in four separate divisions:\n\nThe Heritage Museum displayed the history of Vukovar from prehistory to modern times and some of its most important collections included the items excavated at the [[archaeological site]] Vu\u010dedol and the Culture and History Collection, which contained documents, furniture, and pieces of art, and provided an authentic display of the life of the citizens of Vukovar and the [[Eltz]] family.\n\nThe Bauer Collection contained the most complete overview of modern [[Croatia]]n art from the end of the 19th and the early 20th century with special emphasis on the period between the two world wars. Among more than one thousand pieces of art the Collection contained the works of [[Vlaho Bukovac]] , [[Mato Celestin Medovi\u0107]] , Ico Kr\u0161njavi, [[Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107]] , Fran Kr\u0161ini\u0107 , [[Emanuel Vidovi\u0107]] , and many others.\n\nMemorial Museum of the [[Lavoslav Ru\u017ei\u010dka|Nobel Prize Winner Lavoslav Ru\u017ei\u010dka]], located in the house where he was born, it displayed original documents and medals from the life and work of the famous Nobel Prize winner, who received this prestigious award in 1939 for [[chemistry]].\n\nMemorial Museum of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|2nd Congress of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] was located in the Workers' Hall building, former Grand Hotel, where the congress was held in 1920. The materials connected to the development of the [[labour movement]] and the founding of the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] was exhibited and presented here.\n[[File:Vucedol Culture Museum.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vu\u010dedol Culture Museum]].]]\n\nDuring [[Croatian War of Independence]], Castle [[Eltz]] suffered significant damage and the collections which were kept there were also damaged: some of the exhibits were completely destroyed, some have disappeared and cannot be recovered, and some of them were taken to [[Serbia]]. After years of effort and diplomatic activity by the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of [[Croatia]] that part of the collection was returned to Vukovar on 13 December 2001. In the period from 1991 to 1997 the Vukovar City Museum was operating in the [[Mimara Museum]] in [[Zagreb]].\n\nNear the end of 1992 a collection was founded with the name Vukovar Museum in Exile which began the creation of a collection of donations by Croatian, and soon after also European, artists for the City of Vukovar. To this day that collection has gathered over 1400 pieces of modern Croatian and [[Art of Europe|European art]]. This collection represented the beginning of the cultural restoration of Vukovar and it is displayed at the restored Castle [[Eltz]] today, along with other museum collections which are part of the permanent collection of the museum.\n\nNow that it is renovated, the Castle Eltz complex represents a unique museum and [[Art gallery|gallery]] , science, and [[multimedia]] centre, which preserves and presents [[cultural heritage]] as an element of [[national identity]] and the continuity of life in this area.\n\nIn 2013 the Vukovar City Museum won a prestigious Anton \u0160tifani\u0107 Award for special contributions to the development of tourism in the Republic of Croatia and in 2014 won the Simply the Best award.\n\n===Vu\u010dedol Culture Museum===\n[[File:Radni\u010dki dom u Vukovaru.JPG|thumb|right|Radnicki dom (The Workers' Hall) known originally as the Grand Hotel is one of Vukovar's most familiar architectural landmarks]]\n[[Vu\u010dedol Culture Museum]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waytocroatia.hr/en/component/k2/vukovar-home-of-the-vucedol-dove.html|title=Vukovar \u2013 Home of the Vu\u010dedol Dove \u2013 Way to Croatia|work=waytocroatia.hr}}</ref> is open on the tenth of June 2015.

As for the content, the permanent exhibition is displayed in 19 rooms on almost 1200 square metres. In addition to using state of the art technologies, multimedia and interactive content, the way of life on Vu\u010dedol culture localities, spreading through 12 European countries, is displayed.\n\n==Events==\n[[File:Vukovar-watertower-after-war.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vukovar water tower]], one of the national symbols of [[Croatian War of Independence]]]]\nIn Vukovar during the year there are many cultural events. Certainly the most important is the Danube region [[Vukovar Film Festival]].\n*The [[Vukovar Film Festival]] is unique due to many things. It is the only film festival of the community of [[Danube]] region countries and the only one held literally on the Danube. It is designed to promote and spread the creative development of [[filmmakers]] from the region and it is organised with the intent to contribute to cultural [[Building restoration|restoration]] in the city destroyed in the [[Croatian War of Independence|Homeland War]]. The theme of the festival, the films from the Danube region countries, is logically connected to Vukovar as a centre of the Croatian part of the community of the Danube region. Cultural influences have always spread along the Danube. Since the Vukovar film festival is the only film festival focused on this region, on the international level it seeks to connect filmmakers from the Danube region countries, whose film making industries are some of the most vital in the world.\n*The Vukovar [[Chamber music]] Festival is held in the first half of June at the area of Castle [[Eltz Manor|Eltz]], the Chapel of Saint Rok, and the [[Church of Saints Philip and James, Vukovar|Church of Saint Filip and Jakov in Vukovar]], and it traditionally starts with a concert by the [[Zagreb Philharmonic Orchestra]]. The guests of the festival are solo performers and [[chamber music|chamber]] ensembles from [[Croatia]] and Europe.\n*The [[Vukovar Puppet Spring Festival]] was founded in 1996 as a national theatre conference. There are around 15 puppet theatres performing every year and in the five days of the festival they give around 100 performances in the towns and municipalities of Vukovarsko-Srijemska County. The centre of the festival is the town of Vukovar where 16 performances are played and where various workshops and an awards ceremony are held (for the award for life achievement in contribution to Croatian puppetry). The festival is held at the same time every year, the week before the [[Holy Week]] before [[Easter]]. In 2011 there were 16 puppet theatres from [[Croatia]] and abroad ([[P\u00e9cs|Pecs]], [[Mostar]]) that participated the festival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.assitej-international.org/festival/vukovar-puppets-spring-2/|title=Vukovar puppets spring - Assitej International|website=www.assitej-international.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://vinkovci.com.hr/vinkovci/hrvatska/na-lutkarsko-proljece-dolaze-84-predstave|title=Na Lutkarsko prolje\u0107e dolaze 84 predstave, Vinkovci|website=Portal Vinkovci|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref>\n[[File:Vukovar_City_Centre.jpg|thumb|right|Old baroque city centre]]\n*[[Vincent of Saragossa|Saint Vinko's Day]] in Vu\u010dedol is an event held traditionally every year on 22 January at the Goldschmidt farm grounds. This event marks the beginning of the year's work in the [[vineyards]] and it starts with a blessing of the vineyards. Sausages and other cured meat products are hung on the vines, because of a tradition that by hanging large sausages on the vines, the grape vines will be more fruitful and the grape clusters will be large. The same legend claims that if on that day, before noon, icicles or snow melts and creates puddles in which a sparrow can bathe, the year will be fruitful and there will be so much wine that people can bathe in it. Along with an accompanying culture and art programme, this event represents a true vineyard experience, with mulled wine and delicacies that the [[Tourism|visitors]] may taste or prepare for themselves, on the fire.\n*Bonofest is held every year in the middle of May. It is a festival of [[Spiritual (music)|spiritual music]] held in the [[Church of Saints Philip and James, Vukovar|church of Saint Filip and Jakov]]. The two evenings of the festival feature famous musicians as well as lesser known young musicians who were selected by a committee of professionals. Aside from showing the beauty and richness of spiritual music it encourages lyricists and composers to write new material and carries the message about the beauty of faith and the human need for spirituality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turizamvukovar.hr/vukovar_eng.php?stranica=183|title=VUKOVAR TOURIST BOARD - Bonofest|work=turizamvukovar.hr}}</ref>\n*The Ethno fair is organised each year by the Vukovar City Tourist Board and takes place in September in the city centre in the \"Hotel Grand\" building. Various craftsmen, winemakers and other manufacturers sell their handmade products which represent the heritage of this part of Croatia.\n*The Vukovar Advent Festivities start four weeks during Advent during which a series of musical and performance events are organised. Each event is special as the traditional lighting of the candles is performed.\n*Silent night in Vukovar is a traditional Christmas concert of [[Croatian Radiotelevision|Croatian National Television]]. It is held during Vukovar's Advent Festivities in the [[Church of Saints Philip and James, Vukovar|Church of St. Philip and James]]\n*The Christmas Fair is held a couple of days before Christmas.\n\n==Institutions==\nVukovar is the seat of several local organisations and institutions such as [[Vukovar-Srijem County]], [[Polytechnic Lavoslav Ru\u017ei\u010dka Vukovar]], [[Gymnasium Vukovar]], etc. It is also the seat of several organisations and institutions of the Serb minority in Croatia such as the [[Joint Council of Municipalities]], the [[Association for Serbian language and literature in the Republic of Croatia]], the [[Independent Democratic Serb Party]], the [[Party of Danube Serbs]] as well as the seat of the [[Consulate General of Republic of Serbia in Vukovar]].\n[[File:Kompleks vlastelinstva Eltz, \u017dupanijska 03.jpg|thumb|right|\u017dupanija Palace, seat of the [[Vukovar-Srijem County]]]]\n\n==Economy==\n\nVukovar port is situated on {{convert|1335|km|abbr=off}} of the downstream flow of Danube river, on its right coast, and is the biggest official concessioner in the Vukovar region. The Company focuses its business on the transshipment of general and bulk cargo. The Port (850m long and 45m wide) is conveniently situated on the main current of the river, enabling navigation throughout the whole year regardless of water level.\nThe Port recorded productivity growth and increase in cargo transshipment from 123,570 tons in 2009 to 295,199 tons in 2011. The majority of transshipment was in the category of bulk cargo (237,119 tons in 2011), while packaged goods and heavy cargo accounted for a total of 58,080 tons.\n\nThe economy of Vukovar is based on [[agriculture]], [[trade]], [[viticulture]], [[food industry]], [[textile industry]], building materials industry, [[footwear]] industry and [[tourism]]. Vukovar is the largest Croatian town and river port on the [[Danube]]. Its economy is based on trade, farming, [[viticulture]], livestock breeding, textiles, the food-processing industry, the footwear industry and tourism.\n\nHowever, the port infrastructure in Vukovar, only partly reconstructed, still does not meet the requirements of the market. The layout of the port area, particularly the access to railway tracks and the quay operational area, are technologically inappropriate and not compatible with market standards. There is also a lack of warehouse capacity. Altogether, it affects the quality of the service provided in the Port and thus decreases the port competitiveness.<ref>http://www.aik-invest.hr/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/PortVukovarEN.pdf</ref>\n[[File:Borovo bata.jpg|thumb|left|Former industrial town called Bata \u2013 Ville, today's [[Borovo Naselje]]]]\n\nBorovo, a manufacturer of footwear located in Vukovar, ended up devastated and demolished in 1991 during the war.  In its prime it employed 24,000 employees and tried to break into foreign markets with innovations in the manufacture of footwear, but today there are fewer than 1000 employees.\n\nOn 7 June 1931, Borovo was founded by [[Czechs|Czech]] industrialist [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Ba\u0165a]]. Borovo Factory was one of the few famous Bata Shoes factories in the world. In 1933, the production of rubber and technical goods started, and Bata in the gum industry became one of the first companies in the then Kingdom of Yugoslavia.\n\nBetween 1947 and the end of the 1980s, Borovo grew into the largest and most economically most powerful company in the production and sale of footwear and rubber in this part of Europe. Borovo Facory produced more than 20 million pair of [[shoes]] a year, thousands of tons of auto-rubber and rubber-technical goods, 22,000 people were employed at today's factories with more than 600 stores across the country. This time was marked by the significant export to [[Europe]]an and other countries.\n[[File:Danube port of Vukovar, Croatia (by de.user.Perun).jpg|thumb|right|Vukovar is [[Croatia]]'s biggest river port.]]\n\nThe Business Innovation Centre BIC-Vukovar is a rounded concept for the support of innovative, technologically-oriented entrepreneurship independent of the size or maturity of the company.

The only debate was over whether [[Cesc F\u00e0bregas]], a natural midfielder, would start up front (as he had against Italy and France), or if Del Bosque would pick one of [[Fernando Torres]] (who had started against [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] and [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]]), [[\u00c1lvaro Negredo]] (who played up front in the semi-final against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]]), [[Pedro (footballer, born 1987)|Pedro]] (a substitute against France and Portugal) or the as-yet unused [[Fernando Llorente]]. Spain's defence consisted largely of [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] players \u2013 [[Iker Casillas]] in goal, [[\u00c1lvaro Arbeloa]] on the right side of defence and [[Sergio Ramos]] in the centre. [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]'s [[Gerard Piqu\u00e9]] joined Ramos in the centre, and his new teammate, [[Jordi Alba]] \u2013 recently signed from [[Valencia CF|Valencia]] \u2013 played on the left.

However, after the first two group games, coach [[Cesare Prandelli]] appeared to develop a distinct preference for a [[Formation (association football)#4\u20131\u20133\u20132|4\u20131\u20133\u20132 formation]], with playmaker [[Andrea Pirlo]] occupying the deep midfield role. He also tended to favour a forward pairing of [[Antonio Cassano]] and [[Mario Balotelli]]. Midfielder [[Daniele De Rossi]] had occupied a [[sweeper (association football)|sweeper]] role in the first two group games, but was later used as a left-sided attacking midfielder. Goalkeeper [[Gianluigi Buffon]], left-back [[Giorgio Chiellini]], and centre-backs [[Andrea Barzagli]] and [[Leonardo Bonucci]] formed a strong [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] core to the defence, having gone the entire [[2011\u201312 Serie A]] season unbeaten. They were supported on the right by [[A.C. Milan|Milan]]'s [[Ignazio Abate]], who returned to the team after missing the semi-final through injury, replacing [[Federico Balzaretti]] of [[U.S. Citt\u00e0 di Palermo|Palermo]]. Andrea Pirlo, also of Juventus, again played the deep-lying playmaker role behind his club-mate [[Claudio Marchisio]] on the right wing, Milan's [[Riccardo Montolivo]] in the centre and Daniele De Rossi of [[A.S.

The only debate was over whether [[Cesc F\u00e0bregas]], a natural midfielder, would start up front (as he had against Italy and France), or if Del Bosque would pick one of [[Fernando Torres]] (who had started against [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] and [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]]), [[\u00c1lvaro Negredo]] (who played up front in the semi-final against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]]), [[Pedro (footballer, born 1987)|Pedro]] (a substitute against France and Portugal) or the as-yet unused [[Fernando Llorente]]. Spain's defence consisted largely of [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] players \u2013 [[Iker Casillas]] in goal, [[\u00c1lvaro Arbeloa]] on the right side of defence and [[Sergio Ramos]] in the centre. [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]'s [[Gerard Piqu\u00e9]] joined Ramos in the centre, and his new teammate, [[Jordi Alba]] \u2013 recently signed from [[Valencia CF|Valencia]] \u2013 played on the left. The central midfield featured [[Xavi]] and [[Sergio Busquets]] of Barcelona and Real Madrid's [[Xabi Alonso]], with the flanks patrolled by [[Andr\u00e9s Iniesta]] (also of Barcelona) on the left and [[David Silva]] of [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] \u2013 the only one of the starting line-up not to play for one of Spain's two biggest clubs \u2013 on the right.\n\nIn contrast with Spain's tactical stability, Italy had used a number of different line-ups throughout the tournament, brought about by both injury and suspension. However, after the first two group games, coach [[Cesare Prandelli]] appeared to develop a distinct preference for a [[Formation (association football)#4\u20131\u20133\u20132|4\u20131\u20133\u20132 formation]], with playmaker [[Andrea Pirlo]] occupying the deep midfield role. He also tended to favour a forward pairing of [[Antonio Cassano]] and [[Mario Balotelli]]. Midfielder [[Daniele De Rossi]] had occupied a [[sweeper (association football)|sweeper]] role in the first two group games, but was later used as a left-sided attacking midfielder. Goalkeeper [[Gianluigi Buffon]], left-back [[Giorgio Chiellini]], and centre-backs [[Andrea Barzagli]] and [[Leonardo Bonucci]] formed a strong [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] core to the defence, having gone the entire [[2011\u201312 Serie A]] season unbeaten. They were supported on the right by [[A.C. Milan|Milan]]'s [[Ignazio Abate]], who returned to the team after missing the semi-final through injury, replacing [[Federico Balzaretti]] of [[U.S. Citt\u00e0 di Palermo|Palermo]].

According to the [[Royal Spanish Academy]], \"espa\u00f1ol\" (Spanish) derives from the [[Proven\u00e7al dialect|Proven\u00e7al]] word ''espaignol'' and that, in turn, derives from the [[Medieval Latin]] word ''Hispaniolus'', which means \"from \u2014or pertaining to\u2014 [[Hispania]]\". The Latin form {{smallcaps|<small>H\u012cSP\u0100N\u012cOLUS</small>}} comes from the Latin name of the province of [[Hispania|<small>H\u012cSP\u0100N\u012cA</small>]] that included the current territory of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. In late Latin, the /<small>H</small>/ was silent and /<small>\u012c</small>/ evolved into a short /e/, resulting in the word <small>ESPA\u0147OL(U)</small>.\n\nThere are other hypotheses apart from the one suggested by the Royal Spanish Academy. Some [[Philology|philologists]] argue that \"espa\u00f1ol\" comes from [[Occitan language|Occitan]] ''Espaignon''. On the other hand, Spanish philologist [[Ram\u00f3n Men\u00e9ndez Pidal|Men\u00e9ndez Pidal]] suggested that the classic ''hispanus'' or ''hispanicus'' took the suffix ''-one'' from [[Vulgar Latin]], as it happened with other words such as bret\u00f3n (Breton) or saj\u00f3n (Saxon). The term ''hispanione'' evolved into the [[Old Spanish language|Old Spanish]] ''espa\u00f1\u00f3n'', which eventually, became ''espa\u00f1ol''.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of the Spanish language}}\n\n[[File:CartulariosValpuesta.jpg|right|thumb|The Visigothic [[Cartularies of Valpuesta]], written in a late form of Latin, were declared in 2010 by the Spanish Royal Academy as the record of the earliest words written in Castilian, predating those of the [[Glosas Emilianenses]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euskonews.com/udalak/valpuesta/cartularioshistoria.htm|title=cartularioshistoria|website=www.euskonews.com|access-date=22 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402124945/http://www.euskonews.com/udalak/valpuesta/cartularioshistoria.htm|archive-date=2 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>]]\n\nThe Spanish language evolved from [[Vulgar Latin]], which was brought to the [[Iberian Peninsula]] by the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] during the [[Second Punic War]], beginning in 210 BC. Previously, several pre-Roman languages (also called [[Paleohispanic languages]])\u2014some related to Latin via Indo-European, and some that are not related at all\u2014were spoken in the Iberian Peninsula. These languages included [[Basque language|Basque]] (still spoken today), [[Iberian language|Iberian]], [[Celtiberian language|Celtiberian]] and [[Gallaecian language|Gallaecian]].\n\nThe first documents to show traces of what is today regarded as the precursor of modern Spanish are from the 9th century. Throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and into the [[modern era]], the most important influences on the Spanish lexicon came from neighboring [[Romance languages]]\u2014[[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic]] ([[Andalusi Romance]]), [[Navarro-Aragonese]], [[Leonese language|Leonese]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]], and later, [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]. Spanish also borrowed a considerable number of words from [[Arabic language|Arabic]], as well as a minor influence from the Germanic [[Gothic language]] through the migration of tribes and a period of [[Visigoth]] rule in Iberia. In addition, many more words were borrowed from [[Latin language|Latin]] through the influence of written language and the liturgical language of the Church. The loanwords were taken from both [[Classical Latin]] and [[Renaissance Latin]], the form of Latin in use at that time.\n\nAccording to the theories of [[Ram\u00f3n Men\u00e9ndez Pidal]], local [[sociolect]]s of Vulgar Latin evolved into Spanish, in the north of Iberia, in an area centered in the city of [[Burgos]], and this dialect was later brought to the city of [[Toledo (Spain)|Toledo]], where the written standard of Spanish was first developed, in the 13th century.<ref name=Penny1>{{cite book |title= A History Of The Spanish Language|last=Penny|first= Ralph|authorlink= |year= 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press |edition= 2|pages= 20\u201321}}</ref> In this formative stage, Spanish developed a strongly differing variant from its close cousin, [[Leonese Language|Leonese]], and, according to some authors, was distinguished by a heavy Basque influence (see [[Iberian Romance languages]]). This distinctive dialect spread to southern Spain with the advance of the {{lang|es|[[Reconquista]]}}, and meanwhile gathered a sizable lexical influence from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] of [[Al-Andalus]], much of it indirectly, through the Romance [[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic dialects]] (some 4,000 [[Arabic language|Arabic]]-derived words, make up around 8% of the language today).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O29-SPANISH.html|title=Concise Oxford Companion to the English Language|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=|accessdate=24 July 2008}}</ref> The written standard for this new language was developed in the cities of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], in the 13th to 16th centuries, and [[Madrid]], from the 1570s.<ref name=Penny1 />\n\nThe development of the [[Spanish phonology|Spanish sound system]] from that of [[Vulgar Latin]] exhibits most of the changes that are typical of [[Western Romance languages]], including [[lenition]] of intervocalic consonants (thus Latin {{lang|la|{{smallcaps|v\u012bta}}}} > Spanish {{lang|es|vida}}).

For details on borrowed words and other external influences upon Spanish, see [[Influences on the Spanish language]].\n\n== Grammar ==\n{{Main|Spanish grammar}}\n[[File:Cervantes J\u00e1uregui.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Miguel de Cervantes]], considered by many the greatest author of Spanish literature, and author of ''[[Don Quixote]]'', widely considered the first modern European novel.]]\n\nMost of the grammatical and [[Linguistic typology|typological]] features of Spanish are shared with the other [[Romance languages]]. Spanish is a [[fusional language]]. The [[Spanish nouns|noun]] and [[Spanish adjectives|adjective]] systems exhibit two [[Grammatical gender|genders]] and two [[Grammatical number|numbers]]. In addition, articles and some [[Spanish pronouns|pronouns]] and [[Spanish determiners|determiners]] have a neuter gender in their singular form. There are about fifty [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] forms per [[verb]], with 3 tenses: past, present, future; 2 aspects for past: perfective, imperfective; 4 moods: indicative, subjunctive, conditional, imperative; 3 persons: first, second, third; 2 numbers: singular, plural; 3 [[verboid]] forms: infinitive, gerund, and past participle. Verbs express [[T-V distinction]] by using different persons for formal and informal addresses. (For a detailed overview of verbs, see [[Spanish verbs]] and [[Spanish irregular verbs]].)\n\nSpanish [[syntax]] is considered [[Branching (linguistics)|right-branching]], meaning that subordinate or [[Grammatical modifier|modifying]] [[Constituent (linguistics)|constituents]] tend to be placed after their head words. The language uses [[Preposition and postposition|prepositions]] (rather than postpositions or inflection of nouns for [[Grammatical case|case]]), and usually\u2014though not always\u2014places [[adjective]]s after [[noun]]s, as do most other Romance languages.\n\nThe language is classified as a [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] language; however, as in most Romance languages, constituent order is highly variable and governed mainly by [[topicalization]] and [[Focus (linguistics)|focus]] rather than by syntax. It is a \"[[Pro-drop language|pro-drop]]\", or \"[[Null-subject language|null-subject]]\" language\u2014that is, it allows the deletion of subject pronouns when they are [[Pragmatics|pragmatically]] unnecessary. Spanish is described as a \"[[Verb framing|verb-framed]]\" language, meaning that the ''direction'' of motion is expressed in the verb while the ''mode'' of locomotion is expressed adverbially (e.g. ''subir corriendo'' or ''salir volando''; the respective English equivalents of these examples\u2014'to run up' and 'to fly out'\u2014show that English is, by contrast, \"satellite-framed\", with mode of locomotion expressed in the verb and direction in an adverbial modifier).\n\nSubject/verb inversion is not required in questions, and thus the recognition of declarative or interrogative may depend entirely on intonation.\n\n== Phonology ==\n{{IPA notice}}\n[[File:Miguel Hache - voice.ogg|thumb|Spanish spoken in Spain]]\n{{Main|Spanish phonology}}\n\nThe Spanish phonemic system is originally descended from that of [[Vulgar Latin]]. Its development exhibits some traits in common with the neighboring dialects\u2014especially [[Leonese dialect|Leonese]] and [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]]\u2014as well as other traits unique to [[Castilian Spanish|Castilian]]. Castilian is unique among its neighbors in the aspiration and eventual loss of the Latin initial {{IPA|/f/}} sound (e.g. Cast. {{lang|es|harina}} vs. Leon. and Arag. {{lang|ast|farina}}).<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Zamora Vicente|1967|pp=117 and 222}}</ref> The Latin initial consonant sequences {{lang|la|pl-}}, {{lang|la|cl-}}, and {{lang|la|fl-}} in Spanish typically become {{lang|es|ll-}} (originally pronounced {{IPA|[\u028e]}}), while in Aragonese they are preserved, and in Leonese they present a variety of outcomes, including {{IPA|[t\u0283]}}, {{IPA|[\u0283]}}, and {{IPA|[\u028e]}}. Where Latin had {{lang|la|-li-}} before a vowel (e.g. {{lang|la|filius}}) or the ending {{lang|la|-iculus}}, {{lang|la|-icula}} (e.g. {{lang|la|auricula}}), Old Spanish produced {{IPA|[\u0292]}}, that in Modern Spanish became the velar fricative {{IPA|[x]}} ({{lang|es|hijo}}, {{lang|es|oreja}}, where neighboring languages have the palatal lateral {{IPA|[\u028e]}} (e.g. Portuguese {{lang|pt|filho}}, {{lang|pt|orelha}}; Catalan {{lang|ca|fill}}, {{lang|ca|orella}}).\n\n=== Segmental phonology ===\n[[File:Spanish vowel chart.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|Spanish vowel chart, from {{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Johnson|2010|p=227}}]]\nThe Spanish [[Phoneme|phonemic]] inventory consists of five vowel phonemes ({{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}) and 17 to 19 consonant phonemes (the exact number depending on the dialect<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Hualde|2014|p=39}}</ref>). The main [[Allophone|allophonic]] variation among vowels is the reduction of the high vowels {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} to glides\u2014{{IPA|[j]}} and {{IPA|[w]}} respectively\u2014when unstressed and adjacent to another vowel. Some instances of the mid vowels {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}}, determined lexically, alternate with the diphthongs {{IPA|/je/}} and {{IPA|/we/}} respectively when stressed, in a process that is better described as [[Morphophonology|morphophonemic]] rather than phonological, as it is not predictable from phonology alone.\n\nThe Spanish consonant system is characterized by (1) three [[nasal stop|nasal]] phonemes, and one or two (depending on the dialect) [[lateral consonant|lateral]] phoneme(s), which in syllable-final position [[Archiphonemic|lose their contrast]] and are subject to [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] to a following consonant; (2) three [[Voicelessness|voiceless]] [[Plosive|stops]] and the [[Affricate consonant|affricate]] {{IPA|/t\u0283/}}; (3) three or four (depending on the dialect) [[Voicelessness|voiceless]] [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]]; (4) a set of voiced [[obstruent]]s\u2014{{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, {{IPA|/\u0261/}}, and sometimes {{IPA|/\u029d/}}\u2014which alternate between [[Approximant consonant|approximant]] and [[plosive]] allophones depending on the environment; and (5) a phonemic distinction between the \"[[Flap consonant|tapped]]\" and \"[[Trill consonant|trilled]]\" ''r''-sounds (single {{angle bracket|r}} and double {{angle bracket|rr}} in orthography).\n\nIn the following table of consonant phonemes, {{IPA|/\u028e/}} is marked with an asterisk (*) to indicate that it is preserved only in some dialects. In most dialects it has been merged with {{IPA|/\u029d/}} in the merger called {{lang|es|[[ye\u00edsmo]]}}. Similarly, {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} is also marked with an asterisk to indicate that most dialects do not distinguish it from {{IPA|/s/}} (see {{lang|es|[[seseo]]}}), although this is not a true merger but an outcome of different evolution of sibilants in Southern Spain.\n\nThe phoneme {{IPA|/\u0283/}} is in parentheses () to indicate that it appears only in [[loanwords]]. Each of the voiced obstruent phonemes {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, {{IPA|/\u029d/}}, and {{IPA|/\u0261/}} appears to the right of a ''pair'' of voiceless phonemes, to indicate that, while the ''voiceless'' phonemes maintain a phonemic contrast between plosive (or affricate) and fricative, the ''voiced'' ones alternate [[Allophone|allophonically]] (i.e. without phonemic contrast) between plosive and approximant pronunciations.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; text-align: center;\"\n|+ Consonant phonemes<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Mart\u00ednez-Celdr\u00e1n|Fern\u00e1ndez-Planas|Carrera-Sabat\u00e9|2003|p=255}}</ref>\n|-\n!\n! colspan=2 | [[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n! colspan=2 | [[Dental consonant|Dental]]\n! colspan=2 | [[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! colspan=2 | [[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n! colspan=2 | [[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n|-\n!

The ''tendencies'' of stress assignment are as follows:<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Eddington|2000|p=96}}</ref>\n* In words that end with a vowel, stress most often falls on the penultimate syllable.\n* In words that end with a consonant, stress most often falls on the last syllable, with the following exceptions: The grammatical endings {{lang|es|-n}} (for third-person-plural of verbs) and {{lang|es|-s}} (whether for plural of nouns and adjectives or for second-person-singular of verbs) do not change the location of stress. Thus, regular ''verbs'' ending with {{lang|es|-n}} and the great majority of words ending with {{lang|es|-s}} are stressed on the penult. Although a significant number of nouns and adjectives ending with {{lang|es|-n}} are also stressed on the penult ({{lang|es|joven}}, {{lang|es|virgen}}, {{lang|es|mitin}}), the great majority of nouns and adjectives ending with {{lang|es|-n}} are stressed on their last syllable ({{lang|es|capit\u00e1n}}, {{lang|es|almac\u00e9n}}, {{lang|es|jard\u00edn}}, {{lang|es|coraz\u00f3n}}).\n* Preantepenultimate stress (stress on the fourth-to-last syllable) occurs rarely, only on verbs with [[clitic]] pronouns attached ({{lang|es|guard\u00e1ndoselos}} 'saving them for him/her/them/you').\n\nIn addition to the many exceptions to these tendencies, there are numerous [[minimal pair]]s that contrast solely on stress such as {{lang|es|s\u00e1bana}} ('sheet') and {{lang|es|sabana}} ('savannah'); {{lang|es|l\u00edmite}} ('boundary'), {{lang|es|limite}} ('[that] he/she limits') and {{lang|es|limit\u00e9}} ('I limited'); {{lang|es|l\u00edquido}} ('liquid'), {{lang|es|liquido}} ('I sell off') and {{lang|es|liquid\u00f3}} ('he/she sold off').\n\nThe orthographic system unambiguously reflects where the stress occurs: in the absence of an accent mark, the stress falls on the last syllable unless the last letter is {{angle bracket|n}}, {{angle bracket|s}}, or a vowel, in which cases the stress falls on the next-to-last (penultimate) syllable. Exceptions to those rules are indicated by an acute accent mark over the vowel of the stressed syllable.

The variant is very similar to Mexican Spanish, because of Mexican and Latin American emigration to the Spanish East Indies over the years. \nFrom 1565 to 1821, the Philippines, which were a part of the Spanish East Indies, were governed by the Captaincy General of the Philippines as a territory of the Viceroyalty of New Spain centered in Mexico. It was only administered directly from Spain in 1821 after Mexico gained its independence that same year. Since the Philippines was a former territory of the Viceroyalty of New Spain for most of the Spanish colonial period, Spanish as was spoken in the Philippines had a greater affinity to American Spanish rather than to Peninsular Spanish. \n\n====Chavacano====\n{{main article|Chavacano}}\nChavacano or Chabacano [t\u0283a\u03b2a\u02c8kano] is a group of Spanish-based creole language varieties spoken in the Philippines.

the main dialects of Spanish.]]\n{{Main|Spanish dialects and varieties}}\nThere are important variations ([[Phonology|phonological]], [[Grammar|grammatical]], and [[Lexicon|lexical]]) in the spoken Spanish of the various regions of Spain and throughout the Spanish-speaking areas of the Americas.\n\nThe variety with the most speakers is [[Mexican Spanish]]. It is spoken by more than twenty percent of the world's Spanish speakers (more than 112 million of the total of more than 500 million, according to the table above). One of its main features is the [[vowel reduction|reduction]] or loss of [[unstressed vowel]]s, mainly when they are in contact with the sound /s/.<ref>Eleanor Greet Cotton, John M. Sharp (1988) ''Spanish in the Americas, Volume 2'', pp.154\u2013155, [https://books.google.com/books?id=89KX2RC6Gx0C&pg=PA154&dq=Mexican+vowels&client=firefox-a#v=onepage&q=Mexican%20vowels&f=false URL]</ref><ref>Lope Blanch, Juan M.

Even so, the speech of Madrid, which has typically southern features such as [[ye\u00edsmo]] and s-aspiration, is the standard variety for use on radio and television.<ref>{{cite book |title=Random House Unabridged Dictionary |year=2006 |publisher= Random House Inc. }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |year=2006 |edition=4th |publisher= Houghton Mifflin Company }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary |year=1998 |publisher= MICRA, Inc. }}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861595345/Castilian.html |title=Encarta World English Dictionary |accessdate=5 August 2008 |year=2007 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing Plc. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831041048/http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861595345/Castilian.html |archivedate=31 August 2009 |df= }}</ref> However, the variety used in the media is that of Madrid's educated classes, where southern traits are less evident, in contrast with the variety spoken by working-class Madrid, where those traits are pervasive. The educated variety of Madrid is indicated by many as the one that has most influenced the written standard for Spanish.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Penny |first1=Ralph |title= Variation and Change in Spanish |year= 2000 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-78045-4 |page= 199 |quote= ''whatever might be claimed by other centres, such as Valladolid, it was educated varieties of Madrid Spanish that were mostly regularly reflected in the written standard.''}}</ref>\n\n=== Phonology ===\nThe four main phonological divisions are based respectively on (1) the phoneme [[Voiceless dental fricative|{{IPA|/\u03b8/}}]] (\"theta\"), (2) the [[debuccalization]] of syllable-final {{IPA|/s/}}, (3) the sound of the spelled {{angle bracket|s}}, (4) and the phoneme [[Palatal lateral approximant|{{IPA|/\u028e/}}]] (\"turned ''y''\"),<ref>The [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] symbol \"turned ''y''\" (\u028e), with its \"tail\" leaning to the right, resembles, but is technically different from, the Greek letter lambda (\u03bb), whose tail leans to the left.</ref>\n* The phoneme {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} (spelled {{lang|es|c}} before {{lang|es|e}} or {{lang|es|i}} and spelled {{angle bracket|z}} elsewhere), a [[voiceless dental fricative]] as in English '''''th'''ing'', is maintained by a majority of Spain's population, especially in the northern and central parts of the country. In other areas (some parts of southern Spain, the [[Canary Islands]], and the Americas), {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} doesn't exist and {{IPA|/s/}} occurs instead. The maintenance of phonemic contrast is called {{lang|es|[[distinci\u00f3n]]}} in Spanish, while the merger is generally called {{lang|es|[[seseo]]}} (in reference to the usual realization of the merged phoneme as {{IPA|[s]}}) or, occasionally, {{lang|es|[[ceceo]]}} (referring to its interdental realization, {{IPA|[\u03b8]}}, in some parts of southern Spain). In most of Hispanic America, the spelled {{angle bracket|c}} before {{angle bracket|e}} or {{angle bracket|i}}, and spelled {{angle bracket|z}} is always pronounced as a [[Voiceless alveolar sibilant#Dentalized laminal alveolar|voiceless dental sibilant]].\n* The debuccalization (pronunciation as {{IPA|[h]}}, or loss) of syllable-final {{IPA|/s/}} is associated with the southern half of Spain and lowland Americas: Central America (except central Costa Rica and Guatemala), the Caribbean, coastal areas of southern Mexico, and South America except Andean highlands. Debuccalization is frequently called \"aspiration\" in English, and {{lang|es|aspiraci\u00f3n}} in Spanish. When there is no debuccalization, the syllable-final {{IPA|/s/}} is pronounced as [[Voiceless alveolar sibilant#Retracted alveolar|voiceless \"apico-alveolar\" sibilant]] or as a [[Voiceless alveolar sibilant#Dentalized laminal alveolar|voiceless dental sibilant]] in the same fashion as in the next paragraph.\n* The sound that corresponds to the letter {{angle bracket|s}} is pronounced in northern and central Spain as a [[Voiceless alveolar sibilant#Retracted alveolar|voiceless \"apico-alveolar\" sibilant]] {{IPA|[s\u033a]}} (also described acoustically as \"[[Grave and acute|grave]]\" and articulatorily as \"retracted\"), with a weak \"hushing\" sound reminiscent of {{lcons|retroflex}} fricatives. In [[Andalusia]], [[Canary Islands]] and most of Hispanic America (except in the [[Colombian Spanish#Paisa dialect|Paisa region]] of Colombia) it is pronounced as a [[Voiceless alveolar sibilant#Dentalized laminal alveolar|voiceless dental sibilant]] {{IPA|[s]}}, much like the most frequent pronunciation of the /s/ of English. Because /s/ is one of the most frequent phonemes in Spanish, the difference of pronunciation is one of the first to be noted by a Spanish-speaking person to differentiate Spaniards from Spanish-speakers of the Americas.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n* The phoneme {{IPA|/\u028e/}} spelled {{angle bracket|ll}}, [[Palatal lateral approximant|palatal lateral]] consonant sometimes compared in sound to the sound of the {{angle bracket|lli}} of English ''million'', tends to be maintained in less-urbanized areas of northern Spain and in [[Andean Spanish|highland areas of South America]]. Meanwhile, in the speech of most other Spanish-speakers, it is merged with {{IPA|/\u029d/}} (\"curly-tail ''j''\"), a non-lateral, usually voiced, usually fricative, palatal consonant, sometimes compared to English {{IPA|/j/}} (''yod'') as in '''''y'''acht'' and spelled {{angle bracket|y}} in Spanish. As with other forms of allophony across world languages, the small difference of the spelled {{angle bracket|ll}} and the spelled {{angle bracket|y}} is usually not perceived (the difference is not heard) by people who do not produce them as different phonemes. Such a phonemic merger is called {{lang|es|[[ye\u00edsmo]]}} in Spanish. In [[Rioplatense Spanish]], the merged phoneme is generally pronounced as a postalveolar fricative, either voiced {{IPA|[\u0292]}} (as in English ''measure'' or the French {{angle bracket|j}}) in the central and western parts of the dialectal region ({{lang|es|zhe\u00edsmo}}), or voiceless {{IPA|[\u0283]}} (as in the French {{angle bracket|ch}} or Portuguese {{angle bracket|x}}) in and around Buenos Aires and Montevideo ({{lang|es|she\u00edsmo}}).<ref>Charles B.

The use of {{lang|es|vos}} (and/or its verb forms) is called {{lang|es|[[voseo]]}}. In a few dialects, all three pronouns are used, with {{lang|es|usted}}, {{lang|es|t\u00fa}}, and {{lang|es|vos}} denoting respectively formality, familiarity, and intimacy.<ref name=\"rae.es site\">{{cite web|url=http://buscon.rae.es/dpdI/ |title=Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola |language= es |publisher=Buscon.rae.es |date= |accessdate=21 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn {{lang|es|voseo}}, {{lang|es|vos}} is the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] form ({{lang|es|vos dec\u00eds}}, \"you say\") and the form for the object of a [[Preposition and postposition|preposition]] ({{lang|es|voy con vos}}, \"I am going with you\"), while the direct and indirect [[Object (grammar)|object]] forms, and the [[Possessive adjective|possessives]], are the same as those associated with {{lang|es|t\u00fa}}: {{lang|es|Vos sab\u00e9s que tus amigos te respetan}} (\"You know your friends respect you\").\n\nThe verb forms of ''general voseo'' are the same as those used with {{lang|es|t\u00fa}} except in the present [[grammatical tense|tense]] ([[indicative]] and [[imperative mood|imperative]]) verbs. The forms for {{lang|es|vos}} generally can be derived from those of {{lang|es|vosotros}} (the traditional second-person familiar ''plural'') by deleting the [[semivowel|glide]] {{IPA|[i\u032f]}}, or {{IPA|/d/}}, where it appears in the ending: {{lang|es|vosotros pens\u00e1'''i'''s}} > {{lang|es|vos pens\u00e1s}}; {{lang|es|vosotros volv\u00e9'''i'''s}} > {{lang|es|vos volv\u00e9s}}, {{lang|es|pensa'''d'''!}} ({{lang|es|vosotros}}) > {{lang|es|pens\u00e1!}} ({{lang|es|vos}}), {{lang|es|volve'''d'''!}} ({{lang|es|vosotros}}) > {{lang|es|volv\u00e9!}} ({{lang|es|vos}}) .\n{| cellpadding=\"5\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ General voseo <small>([[Rioplatense Spanish|River Plate Spanish]])</small>\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Indicative\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Subjunctive\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Imperative\n|-\n!

Generally, it can be said that there are zones of exclusive use of {{lang|es|tuteo}} (the use of {{lang|es|t\u00fa}}) in the following areas: almost all of [[Mexico]], the West Indies, [[Panama]], most of [[Colombia]], [[Peru]], [[Venezuela]] and coastal [[Ecuador]].\n\n{{lang|es|Tuteo}} as a cultured form alternates with {{lang|es|voseo}} as a popular or rural form in [[Bolivia]], in the north and south of Peru, in Andean Ecuador, in small zones of the Venezuelan Andes (and most notably in the Venezuelan state of [[Zulia]]), and in a large part of Colombia. Some researchers maintain that {{lang|es|voseo}} can be heard in some parts of eastern Cuba, and others assert that it is absent from the island.<ref>Katia Salamanca de Abreu, [http://cvc.cervantes.es/lengua/thesaurus/pdf/28/TH_28_001_138_0.pdf review of Humberto L\u00f3pez Morales, ''Estudios sobre el espa\u00f1ol de Cuba''] (New York: Editorial Las Am\u00e9ricas, 1970), in ''Thesaurus'', 28 (1973), 138\u2013146.</ref>\n\n{{lang|es|Tuteo}} exists as the second-person usage with an intermediate degree of formality alongside the more familiar {{lang|es|voseo}} in [[Chile]], in the Venezuelan state of [[Zulia]], on the Caribbean coast of [[Colombia]], in the [[Azuero Peninsula]] in Panama, in the Mexican state of [[Chiapas]], and in parts of Guatemala.\n\nAreas of generalized {{lang|es|voseo}} include [[Argentina]], [[Nicaragua]], eastern [[Bolivia]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Paraguay]], [[Uruguay]] and the Colombian departments of [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]], [[Caldas Department|Caldas]], [[Risaralda Department|Risaralda]], [[Quindio]] and [[Valle del Cauca]].<ref name=\"rae.es site\" />\n\n==== Ustedes ====\n{{lang|es|Ustedes}} functions as formal and informal second person plural in over 90% of the Spanish-speaking world, including all of Hispanic America, the [[Canary Islands]], and some regions of [[Andalusia]]. In [[Seville]], [[Huelva]], [[Cadiz]], and other parts of western [[Andalusia]], the familiar form is constructed as {{lang|es|ustedes vais}}, using the traditional second-person plural form of the verb. Most of Spain maintains the [[T-V distinction|formal/familiar distinction]] with {{lang|es|ustedes}} and {{lang|es|vosotros}} respectively.\n\n==== Usted ====\n{{lang|es|Usted}} is the usual second-person singular pronoun in a formal context, but it is used jointly with the third-person singular voice of the verb. It is used to convey respect toward someone who is a generation older or is of higher authority (\"you, sir\"/\"you, ma'am\"). It is also used in a ''familiar'' context by many speakers in Colombia and Costa Rica and in parts of Ecuador and Panama, to the exclusion of {{lang|es|t\u00fa}} or {{lang|es|vos}}. This usage is sometimes called {{lang|es|[[:es:Ustedeo|ustedeo]]}} in Spanish.\n\nIn Central America, especially in Honduras, {{lang|es|usted}} is often used as a formal pronoun to convey respect between the members of a romantic couple. {{lang|es|Usted}} is also used that way between parents and children in the Andean regions of Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela.\n\n==== Third-person object pronouns ====\nMost speakers use (and the {{lang|es|[[Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola]]}} prefers) the pronouns {{lang|es|lo}} and {{lang|es|la}} for [[Direct object#The object in linguistics|''direct'' objects]] (masculine and feminine respectively, regardless of [[animacy]], meaning \"him\", \"her\", or \"it\"), and {{lang|es|le}} for [[Direct object#The object in linguistics|''indirect'' objects]] (regardless of [[Grammatical gender|gender]] or [[animacy]], meaning \"to him\", \"to her\", or \"to it\"). The usage is sometimes called \"etymological\", as these direct and indirect object pronouns are a continuation, respectively, of the [[Accusative case|accusative]] and [[Dative case|dative]] pronouns of Latin, the ancestor language of Spanish.\n\nDeviations from this norm (more common in Spain than in the Americas) are called \"{{lang|es|[[le\u00edsmo]]}}\", \"{{lang|es|[[lo\u00edsmo]]}}\", or \"{{lang|es|[[la\u00edsmo]]}}\", according to which respective pronoun, {{lang|es|le}}, {{lang|es|lo}}, or {{lang|es|la}}, has expanded beyond the etymological usage ({{lang|es|le}} as a direct object, or {{lang|es|lo}} or {{lang|es|la}} as an indirect object).\n\n=== Vocabulary ===\nSome words can be significantly different in different Hispanophone countries. Most Spanish speakers can recognize other Spanish forms even in places where they are not commonly used, but Spaniards generally do not recognize specifically American usages. For example, Spanish {{lang|es|mantequilla}}, {{lang|es|aguacate}} and {{lang|es|albaricoque}} (respectively, 'butter', 'avocado', 'apricot') correspond to {{lang|es|manteca}} (word used for [[lard]] in [[Peninsular Spanish]]), {{lang|es|palta}}, and {{lang|es|damasco}}, respectively, in Argentina, Chile (except {{lang|es|manteca}}), Paraguay, Peru (except {{lang|es|manteca}} and {{lang|es|damasco}}), and Uruguay.\n\n== Relation to other languages ==\n{{further|Comparison of Portuguese and Spanish}}\nSpanish is closely related to the other [[West Iberian languages|West Iberian Romance languages]], including [[Asturian language|Asturian]], [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Ladino language|Ladino]], [[Leonese Language|Leonese]], [[Mirandese language|Mirandese]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].\n\nIt is generally acknowledged that Portuguese and Spanish speakers can communicate in written form, with varying degrees of mutual intelligibility.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Jensen|1989}}</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Penny|2000|p=14}}</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Dalby|1998|p=501}}</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Ginsburgh|Weber|2011|p=90}}</ref>\n[[Mutual intelligibility]] of the ''written'' Spanish and Portuguese languages is remarkably high, and the difficulties of the spoken forms are based more on phonology than on grammatical and lexical dissimilarities. ''[[Ethnologue]]'' gives estimates of the [[lexical similarity]] between related languages in terms of precise percentages. For Spanish and Portuguese, that figure is 89%. Italian, on the other hand its phonology similar to Spanish, but has a lower lexical similarity of 82%. Mutual intelligibility between Spanish and [[French language|French]] or between Spanish and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] is lower still, given lexical similarity ratings of 75% and 71% respectively.<ref name=\"ethnologue\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=spa|title=Spanish|work=Ethnologue}}</ref><ref name=\"ezglot\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ezglot.com/most-similar-languages.php?l=spa|title=Similar languages to Spanish|work=EZGlot}}</ref> And comprehension of Spanish by French speakers who have not studied the language is much lower, at an estimated 45%. In general, thanks to the common features of the writing systems of the Romance languages, interlingual comprehension of the written word is greater than that of oral communication.\n\nThe following table compares the forms of some common words in several Romance languages:\n<div style=\"overflow:auto;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Other theories suggest, on the basis of what is used to make cheese, a derivation from Latin ''brandeum'' (originally meaning a linen covering, later a thin cloth for relic storage) through an intermediate root *''brandea''. For the development of the meaning, cf. Spanish ''manteca'', Portuguese ''manteiga'', probably from Latin ''mantica'' ('sack'), Italian ''formaggio'' and French ''fromage'' from ''formaticus''.

Therefore, its relationship to Spanish is comparable with that of the [[Yiddish language]] to [[German language|German]]. Ladino speakers today are almost exclusively [[Sephardim|Sephardi]] Jews, with family roots in Turkey, Greece, or the Balkans, and living mostly in Israel, Turkey, and the United States, with a few communities in Hispanic America.<ref name=\"Ladino\" /> Judaeo-Spanish lacks the [[Amerindian languages|Native American vocabulary]] which was acquired by standard Spanish during the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonial period]], and it retains many archaic features which have since been lost in standard Spanish. It contains, however, other vocabulary which is not found in standard Spanish, including vocabulary from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], French, Greek and [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and other languages spoken where the Sephardim settled.\n\nJudaeo-Spanish is in serious danger of extinction because many native speakers today are elderly as well as elderly ''olim'' (immigrants to [[Israel]]) who have not transmitted the language to their children or grandchildren. However, it is experiencing a minor revival among Sephardi communities, especially in music. In the case of the Latin American communities, the danger of extinction is also due to the risk of assimilation by modern Castilian.\n\nA related dialect is [[Haketia]], the Judaeo-Spanish of northern Morocco. This too tended to assimilate with modern Spanish, during the Spanish occupation of the region.\n\n== Writing system ==\n{{Main|Spanish orthography}}\n{{Spanish language}}\nSpanish is written in the [[Latin script]], with the addition of the character {{angle bracket|[[\u00f1]]}} ({{lang|es|e\u00f1e}}, representing the phoneme {{IPA|/[[Palatal nasal|\u0272]]/}}, a letter distinct from {{angle bracket|n}}, although typographically composed of an {{angle bracket|n}} with a [[tilde]]). Formerly the [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] {{angle bracket|ch}} ({{lang|es|che}}, representing the phoneme {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0283/}}) and {{angle bracket|ll}} ({{lang|es|elle}}, representing the phoneme {{IPA|/[[Palatal lateral approximant|\u028e]]/}}), were also considered single letters. However, the digraph {{angle bracket|rr}} ({{lang|es|erre fuerte}}, 'strong r', {{lang|es|erre doble}}, 'double r', or simply {{lang|es|erre}}), which also represents a distinct phoneme {{IPA|/r/}}, was not similarly regarded as a single letter. Since 1994 {{angle bracket|ch}} and {{angle bracket|ll}} have been treated as letter pairs for [[collation]] purposes, though they remained a part of the alphabet until 2010. Words with {{angle bracket|ch}} are now alphabetically sorted between those with {{angle bracket|cg}} and {{angle bracket|ci}}, instead of following {{angle bracket|cz}} as they used to. The situation is similar for {{angle bracket|ll}}.<ref>[http://buscon.rae.es/dpdI/SrvltConsulta?lema=ch Diccionario Panhisp\u00e1nico de Dudas], 1st ed.</ref><ref>[http://www.rae.es/ Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola], [http://www.spanishpronto.com/spanishpronto/spanishalphabet.html Explanation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070906105503/https://www.spanishpronto.com/spanishpronto/spanishalphabet.html |date=6 September 2007 }} at [http://www.spanishpronto.com/ Spanish Pronto] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914002335/https://www.spanishpronto.com/ |date=14 September 2007 }} {{in lang|es|en}}</ref>\n\nThus, the Spanish alphabet has the following 27 letters:\n\n:{{lang|es|A, B, C,<!-- ch considered digraph - see next references. --> D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L,<!-- ll considered digraph - see next references. --> M, N, \u00d1, O, P, Q, R, <!-- but not rr See previous paragraph. --> S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.}}\n\nSince 2010, none of the digraphs ({{lang|es|ch, ll, rr, gu, qu}}) is considered a letter by the Spanish Royal Academy.<ref>[http://www.rae.es/consultas/exclusion-de-ch-y-ll-del-abecedario Exclusi\u00f3n de ch y ll del abecedario, RAE]</ref>\n\nThe letters {{lang|es|k}} and {{lang|es|w}} are used only in words and names coming from foreign languages ({{lang|es|kilo, folklore, whisky, kiwi}}, etc.).\n\nWith the exclusion of a very small number of regional terms such as {{lang|es|[[M\u00e9xico]]}} (see [[Toponymy of Mexico#Phonetic evolution|Toponymy of Mexico]]), pronunciation can be entirely determined from spelling. Under the orthographic conventions, a typical Spanish word is stressed on the [[syllable]] before the last if it ends with a vowel (not including {{angle bracket|y}}) or with a vowel followed by {{angle bracket|n}} or an {{angle bracket|s}}; it is stressed on the last syllable otherwise. Exceptions to this rule are indicated by placing an [[acute accent]] on the [[stress (linguistics)|stressed vowel]].\n\nThe acute accent is used, in addition, to distinguish between certain [[homophone]]s, especially when one of them is a stressed word and the other one is a [[clitic]]: compare {{lang|es|el}} ('the', masculine singular definite article) with {{lang|es|\u00e9l}} ('he' or 'it'), or {{lang|es|te}} ('you', object pronoun) with {{lang|es|t\u00e9}} ('tea'), {{lang|es|de}} (preposition 'of') versus {{lang|es|d\u00e9}} ('give' [formal imperative/third-person present subjunctive]), and {{lang|es|se}} (reflexive pronoun) versus {{lang|es|s\u00e9}} ('I know' or imperative 'be').\n\nThe interrogative pronouns ({{lang|es|qu\u00e9}}, {{lang|es|cu\u00e1l}}, {{lang|es|d\u00f3nde}}, {{lang|es|qui\u00e9n}}, etc.) also receive accents in direct or indirect questions, and some demonstratives ({{lang|es|\u00e9se}}, {{lang|es|\u00e9ste}}, {{lang|es|aqu\u00e9l}}, etc.) can be accented when used as pronouns. Accent marks used to be omitted on capital letters (a widespread practice in the days of [[typewriter]]s and the early days of computers when only lowercase vowels were available with accents), although the {{lang|es|Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola}} advises against this and the orthographic conventions taught at schools enforce the use of the accent.\n\nWhen {{lang|es|u}} is written between {{lang|es|g}} and a front vowel {{lang|es|e}} or {{lang|es|i}}, it indicates a \"[[Hard and soft G|hard g]]\" pronunciation. A [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] {{lang|es|\u00fc}} indicates that it is not silent as it normally would be (e.g., {{lang|es|cig\u00fce\u00f1a}}, 'stork', is pronounced {{IPA|[\u03b8i\u02c8\u0263we\u0272a]}}; if it were written *{{lang|es|cigue\u00f1a}}, it would be pronounced *{{IPA|[\u03b8i\u02c8\u0263e\u0272a]}}).\n\nInterrogative and exclamatory clauses are introduced with [[inverted question and exclamation marks]] ({{lang|es|\u00bf}} and {{lang|es|\u00a1}}, respectively).\n\n== Organizations ==\n[[File:Academia de la Lengua.jpg|thumb|The [[Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola|Royal Spanish Academy]] Headquarters in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]].]]\n\n=== Royal Spanish Academy ===\n{{main|Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola}}\n[[File:Coat of Arms of the Royal Spanish Academy.svg|left|thumb|upright=0.27|Arms of the Royal Spanish Academy]]\nThe {{lang|es|Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola}} (Royal Spanish Academy), founded in 1713,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.uwaterloo.ca/society/history/1713rae.html |title=Scholarly Societies Project |publisher=Lib.uwaterloo.ca |date= |accessdate=6 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923234545/http://www.lib.uwaterloo.ca/society/history/1713rae.html |archivedate=23 September 2010 }}</ref> together with the 21 other national ones (see [[Association of Spanish Language Academies]]), exercises a standardizing influence through its publication of dictionaries and widely respected grammar and style guides.<ref>{{cite book|last=Batchelor|first=Ronald Ernest|title=Using Spanish: a guide to contemporary usage|year=1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-26987-3|page=318|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eEWZL1j9ig8C&pg=PA4&dq=real+academia+espa%C3%B1ola+recognized#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\nBecause of influence and for other sociohistorical reasons, a standardized form of the language ([[Standard Spanish]]) is widely acknowledged for use in literature, academic contexts and the media.\n\n=== Association of Spanish Language Academies ===\n{{main|Association of Spanish Language Academies}}\n[[File:Pa\u00edses con academia de la lengua espa\u00f1ola.png|thumb|Countries members of the ASALE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asale.org/ASALE/asale.html |title=Association of Spanish Language Academies |language=Spanish |publisher=Asale |accessdate=5 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923155313/http://asale.org/ASALE/asale.html |archivedate=23 September 2010 }}</ref>]]\nThe Association of Spanish Language Academies ({{lang|es|Asociaci\u00f3n de Academias de la Lengua Espa\u00f1ola}}, or {{lang|es|ASALE}}) is the entity which regulates the Spanish language.

headquarters, [[Madrid]]]]\nThe {{lang|es|Instituto Cervantes}} (Cervantes Institute) is a worldwide nonprofit organization created by the Spanish government in 1991. This organization has branched out in over 20 different countries, with 75 centers devoted to the Spanish and Hispanic American cultures and Spanish language. The ultimate goals of the Institute are to promote universally the education, the study, and the use of Spanish as a second language, to support methods and activities that help the process of Spanish-language education, and to contribute to the advancement of the Spanish and Hispanic American cultures in non-Spanish-speaking countries. The Institute's 2015 report \"El espa\u00f1ol, una lengua viva\" (Spanish, a living language) estimated that there were 559 million Spanish speakers worldwide. Its latest annual report \"[https://www.cervantes.es/sobre_instituto_cervantes/prensa/2018/noticias/np_presentacion-anuario.htm El espa\u00f1ol en el mundo 2018]\" (Spanish in the world 2018) counts 577 million Spanish speakers worldwide. Among the sources cited in the report is the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], which estimates that the U.S. will have 138 million Spanish speakers by 2050, making it the biggest Spanish-speaking nation on earth, with Spanish the mother tongue of almost a third of its citizens.<ref>Stephen Burgen, [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/29/us-second-biggest-spanish-speaking-country US now has more Spanish speakers than Spain \u2013 only Mexico has more], US News, 29 June 2015.</ref>\n\n=== Official use by international organizations ===\n{{Main|List of countries where Spanish is an official language#International organizations where Spanish is official}}\n\nSpanish is one of the official languages of the [[United Nations]], the [[European Union]], the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[Organization of American States]], the [[Organization of Ibero-American States]], the [[African Union]], the [[Union of South American Nations]], the [[Antarctic Treaty Secretariat]], the [[Latin Union]], the [[Caricom]], the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], and numerous other international organizations.\n{{clear right}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Language}}\n{{col-start-fixed|width=calc(100% \u2013 256px)}}\n{{col-break}}\n* [[List of Spanish-language poets]]\n* [[Fund\u00e9u BBVA]]\n* [[Spanish as a second or foreign language]]\n\n; Spanish words and phrases\n* [[Longest word in Spanish]]\n* [[Most common words in Spanish]]\n* [[Spanish profanity]]\n* [[Spanish proverbs]]\n* [[List of English\u2013Spanish interlingual homographs]]\n* [[Cuento]]\n\n; [[Hispanosphere|Spanish-speaking world]]\n* [[List of countries where Spanish is an official language|Countries where Spanish is an official language]]\n* [[Hispanic culture]]\n* [[Hispanicization]]\n* [[Hispanidad]]\n* [[Hispanism]]\n* [[Hispanosphere]]\n* [[Panhispanism]]\n{{col-break}}\n; [[Influences on the Spanish language]]\n* [[Arabic influence on the Spanish language]]\n* [[List of Spanish words of Germanic origin]]\n* [[List of Spanish words of Nahuatl origin]]\n* [[List of Spanish words of Indigenous American Indian origin]]\n* [[List of Spanish words of Philippine origin]]\n; [[Spanish-based creole languages|Dialects and languages influenced by Spanish]]\n* [[Cal\u00f3 language|Cal\u00f3]]\n* [[Chamorro language|Chamorro]]\n* [[Chavacano]]\n* [[Frespa\u00f1ol]]\n* [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]]\n* [[Llanito]]\n* [[Palenquero]]\n* [[Papiamento]]\n* [[Philippine languages]]\n* [[Portu\u00f1ol]]\n* [[Spanglish]]\n* [[Spanish-based creole languages]]\n* [[List of English words of Spanish origin]]\n{{col-break}}\n; [[Spanish dialects and varieties]]\n* '''European Spanish'''\n** [[Peninsular Spanish]]\n*** [[Andalusian Spanish]]\n*** [[Castilian Spanish]]\n*** [[Castrapo]] (Galician Spanish)\n*** [[Cast\u00fao]] (Extremaduran Spanish)\n*** [[Murcian Spanish]]\n** Insular Spanish\n*** [[Canarian Spanish]]\n* '''[[Spanish language in the Americas|Spanish in the Americas]]'''\n** [[North American Spanish]]\n** [[Central American Spanish]]\n** [[Caribbean Spanish]]\n** [[Spanish language in South America|South American Spanish]]\n** [[Spanish language in the United States|Spanish in the United States]]\n* '''Spanish in Africa'''\n** [[Equatoguinean Spanish]]\n** [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]]\n* '''Spanish in Asia'''\n** [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish in the Philippines]]<ref>A First Spanish Reader, by Erwin W.

According to the [[Royal Spanish Academy]], \"espa\u00f1ol\" (Spanish) derives from the [[Proven\u00e7al dialect|Proven\u00e7al]] word ''espaignol'' and that, in turn, derives from the [[Medieval Latin]] word ''Hispaniolus'', which means \"from \u2014or pertaining to\u2014 [[Hispania]]\". The Latin form {{smallcaps|<small>H\u012cSP\u0100N\u012cOLUS</small>}} comes from the Latin name of the province of [[Hispania|<small>H\u012cSP\u0100N\u012cA</small>]] that included the current territory of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. In late Latin, the /<small>H</small>/ was silent and /<small>\u012c</small>/ evolved into a short /e/, resulting in the word <small>ESPA\u0147OL(U)</small>.\n\nThere are other hypotheses apart from the one suggested by the Royal Spanish Academy. Some [[Philology|philologists]] argue that \"espa\u00f1ol\" comes from [[Occitan language|Occitan]] ''Espaignon''. On the other hand, Spanish philologist [[Ram\u00f3n Men\u00e9ndez Pidal|Men\u00e9ndez Pidal]] suggested that the classic ''hispanus'' or ''hispanicus'' took the suffix ''-one'' from [[Vulgar Latin]], as it happened with other words such as bret\u00f3n (Breton) or saj\u00f3n (Saxon). The term ''hispanione'' evolved into the [[Old Spanish language|Old Spanish]] ''espa\u00f1\u00f3n'', which eventually, became ''espa\u00f1ol''.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of the Spanish language}}\n\n[[File:CartulariosValpuesta.jpg|right|thumb|The Visigothic [[Cartularies of Valpuesta]], written in a late form of Latin, were declared in 2010 by the Spanish Royal Academy as the record of the earliest words written in Castilian, predating those of the [[Glosas Emilianenses]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euskonews.com/udalak/valpuesta/cartularioshistoria.htm|title=cartularioshistoria|website=www.euskonews.com|access-date=22 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402124945/http://www.euskonews.com/udalak/valpuesta/cartularioshistoria.htm|archive-date=2 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>]]\n\nThe Spanish language evolved from [[Vulgar Latin]], which was brought to the [[Iberian Peninsula]] by the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] during the [[Second Punic War]], beginning in 210 BC. Previously, several pre-Roman languages (also called [[Paleohispanic languages]])\u2014some related to Latin via Indo-European, and some that are not related at all\u2014were spoken in the Iberian Peninsula. These languages included [[Basque language|Basque]] (still spoken today), [[Iberian language|Iberian]], [[Celtiberian language|Celtiberian]] and [[Gallaecian language|Gallaecian]].\n\nThe first documents to show traces of what is today regarded as the precursor of modern Spanish are from the 9th century. Throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and into the [[modern era]], the most important influences on the Spanish lexicon came from neighboring [[Romance languages]]\u2014[[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic]] ([[Andalusi Romance]]), [[Navarro-Aragonese]], [[Leonese language|Leonese]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]], and later, [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]. Spanish also borrowed a considerable number of words from [[Arabic language|Arabic]], as well as a minor influence from the Germanic [[Gothic language]] through the migration of tribes and a period of [[Visigoth]] rule in Iberia. In addition, many more words were borrowed from [[Latin language|Latin]] through the influence of written language and the liturgical language of the Church. The loanwords were taken from both [[Classical Latin]] and [[Renaissance Latin]], the form of Latin in use at that time.\n\nAccording to the theories of [[Ram\u00f3n Men\u00e9ndez Pidal]], local [[sociolect]]s of Vulgar Latin evolved into Spanish, in the north of Iberia, in an area centered in the city of [[Burgos]], and this dialect was later brought to the city of [[Toledo (Spain)|Toledo]], where the written standard of Spanish was first developed, in the 13th century.<ref name=Penny1>{{cite book |title= A History Of The Spanish Language|last=Penny|first= Ralph|authorlink= |year= 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press |edition= 2|pages= 20\u201321}}</ref> In this formative stage, Spanish developed a strongly differing variant from its close cousin, [[Leonese Language|Leonese]], and, according to some authors, was distinguished by a heavy Basque influence (see [[Iberian Romance languages]]). This distinctive dialect spread to southern Spain with the advance of the {{lang|es|[[Reconquista]]}}, and meanwhile gathered a sizable lexical influence from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] of [[Al-Andalus]], much of it indirectly, through the Romance [[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic dialects]] (some 4,000 [[Arabic language|Arabic]]-derived words, make up around 8% of the language today).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O29-SPANISH.html|title=Concise Oxford Companion to the English Language|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=|accessdate=24 July 2008}}</ref> The written standard for this new language was developed in the cities of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], in the 13th to 16th centuries, and [[Madrid]], from the 1570s.<ref name=Penny1 />\n\nThe development of the [[Spanish phonology|Spanish sound system]] from that of [[Vulgar Latin]] exhibits most of the changes that are typical of [[Western Romance languages]], including [[lenition]] of intervocalic consonants (thus Latin {{lang|la|{{smallcaps|v\u012bta}}}} > Spanish {{lang|es|vida}}).

For details on borrowed words and other external influences upon Spanish, see [[Influences on the Spanish language]].\n\n== Grammar ==\n{{Main|Spanish grammar}}\n[[File:Cervantes J\u00e1uregui.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Miguel de Cervantes]], considered by many the greatest author of Spanish literature, and author of ''[[Don Quixote]]'', widely considered the first modern European novel.]]\n\nMost of the grammatical and [[Linguistic typology|typological]] features of Spanish are shared with the other [[Romance languages]]. Spanish is a [[fusional language]]. The [[Spanish nouns|noun]] and [[Spanish adjectives|adjective]] systems exhibit two [[Grammatical gender|genders]] and two [[Grammatical number|numbers]]. In addition, articles and some [[Spanish pronouns|pronouns]] and [[Spanish determiners|determiners]] have a neuter gender in their singular form. There are about fifty [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] forms per [[verb]], with 3 tenses: past, present, future; 2 aspects for past: perfective, imperfective; 4 moods: indicative, subjunctive, conditional, imperative; 3 persons: first, second, third; 2 numbers: singular, plural; 3 [[verboid]] forms: infinitive, gerund, and past participle. Verbs express [[T-V distinction]] by using different persons for formal and informal addresses. (For a detailed overview of verbs, see [[Spanish verbs]] and [[Spanish irregular verbs]].)\n\nSpanish [[syntax]] is considered [[Branching (linguistics)|right-branching]], meaning that subordinate or [[Grammatical modifier|modifying]] [[Constituent (linguistics)|constituents]] tend to be placed after their head words. The language uses [[Preposition and postposition|prepositions]] (rather than postpositions or inflection of nouns for [[Grammatical case|case]]), and usually\u2014though not always\u2014places [[adjective]]s after [[noun]]s, as do most other Romance languages.\n\nThe language is classified as a [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] language; however, as in most Romance languages, constituent order is highly variable and governed mainly by [[topicalization]] and [[Focus (linguistics)|focus]] rather than by syntax. It is a \"[[Pro-drop language|pro-drop]]\", or \"[[Null-subject language|null-subject]]\" language\u2014that is, it allows the deletion of subject pronouns when they are [[Pragmatics|pragmatically]] unnecessary. Spanish is described as a \"[[Verb framing|verb-framed]]\" language, meaning that the ''direction'' of motion is expressed in the verb while the ''mode'' of locomotion is expressed adverbially (e.g. ''subir corriendo'' or ''salir volando''; the respective English equivalents of these examples\u2014'to run up' and 'to fly out'\u2014show that English is, by contrast, \"satellite-framed\", with mode of locomotion expressed in the verb and direction in an adverbial modifier).\n\nSubject/verb inversion is not required in questions, and thus the recognition of declarative or interrogative may depend entirely on intonation.\n\n== Phonology ==\n{{IPA notice}}\n[[File:Miguel Hache - voice.ogg|thumb|Spanish spoken in Spain]]\n{{Main|Spanish phonology}}\n\nThe Spanish phonemic system is originally descended from that of [[Vulgar Latin]]. Its development exhibits some traits in common with the neighboring dialects\u2014especially [[Leonese dialect|Leonese]] and [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]]\u2014as well as other traits unique to [[Castilian Spanish|Castilian]]. Castilian is unique among its neighbors in the aspiration and eventual loss of the Latin initial {{IPA|/f/}} sound (e.g. Cast. {{lang|es|harina}} vs. Leon. and Arag. {{lang|ast|farina}}).<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Zamora Vicente|1967|pp=117 and 222}}</ref> The Latin initial consonant sequences {{lang|la|pl-}}, {{lang|la|cl-}}, and {{lang|la|fl-}} in Spanish typically become {{lang|es|ll-}} (originally pronounced {{IPA|[\u028e]}}), while in Aragonese they are preserved, and in Leonese they present a variety of outcomes, including {{IPA|[t\u0283]}}, {{IPA|[\u0283]}}, and {{IPA|[\u028e]}}. Where Latin had {{lang|la|-li-}} before a vowel (e.g. {{lang|la|filius}}) or the ending {{lang|la|-iculus}}, {{lang|la|-icula}} (e.g. {{lang|la|auricula}}), Old Spanish produced {{IPA|[\u0292]}}, that in Modern Spanish became the velar fricative {{IPA|[x]}} ({{lang|es|hijo}}, {{lang|es|oreja}}, where neighboring languages have the palatal lateral {{IPA|[\u028e]}} (e.g. Portuguese {{lang|pt|filho}}, {{lang|pt|orelha}}; Catalan {{lang|ca|fill}}, {{lang|ca|orella}}).\n\n=== Segmental phonology ===\n[[File:Spanish vowel chart.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|Spanish vowel chart, from {{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Johnson|2010|p=227}}]]\nThe Spanish [[Phoneme|phonemic]] inventory consists of five vowel phonemes ({{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}) and 17 to 19 consonant phonemes (the exact number depending on the dialect<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Hualde|2014|p=39}}</ref>). The main [[Allophone|allophonic]] variation among vowels is the reduction of the high vowels {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} to glides\u2014{{IPA|[j]}} and {{IPA|[w]}} respectively\u2014when unstressed and adjacent to another vowel. Some instances of the mid vowels {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}}, determined lexically, alternate with the diphthongs {{IPA|/je/}} and {{IPA|/we/}} respectively when stressed, in a process that is better described as [[Morphophonology|morphophonemic]] rather than phonological, as it is not predictable from phonology alone.\n\nThe Spanish consonant system is characterized by (1) three [[nasal stop|nasal]] phonemes, and one or two (depending on the dialect) [[lateral consonant|lateral]] phoneme(s), which in syllable-final position [[Archiphonemic|lose their contrast]] and are subject to [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] to a following consonant; (2) three [[Voicelessness|voiceless]] [[Plosive|stops]] and the [[Affricate consonant|affricate]] {{IPA|/t\u0283/}}; (3) three or four (depending on the dialect) [[Voicelessness|voiceless]] [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]]; (4) a set of voiced [[obstruent]]s\u2014{{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, {{IPA|/\u0261/}}, and sometimes {{IPA|/\u029d/}}\u2014which alternate between [[Approximant consonant|approximant]] and [[plosive]] allophones depending on the environment; and (5) a phonemic distinction between the \"[[Flap consonant|tapped]]\" and \"[[Trill consonant|trilled]]\" ''r''-sounds (single {{angle bracket|r}} and double {{angle bracket|rr}} in orthography).\n\nIn the following table of consonant phonemes, {{IPA|/\u028e/}} is marked with an asterisk (*) to indicate that it is preserved only in some dialects. In most dialects it has been merged with {{IPA|/\u029d/}} in the merger called {{lang|es|[[ye\u00edsmo]]}}. Similarly, {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} is also marked with an asterisk to indicate that most dialects do not distinguish it from {{IPA|/s/}} (see {{lang|es|[[seseo]]}}), although this is not a true merger but an outcome of different evolution of sibilants in Southern Spain.\n\nThe phoneme {{IPA|/\u0283/}} is in parentheses () to indicate that it appears only in [[loanwords]]. Each of the voiced obstruent phonemes {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, {{IPA|/\u029d/}}, and {{IPA|/\u0261/}} appears to the right of a ''pair'' of voiceless phonemes, to indicate that, while the ''voiceless'' phonemes maintain a phonemic contrast between plosive (or affricate) and fricative, the ''voiced'' ones alternate [[Allophone|allophonically]] (i.e. without phonemic contrast) between plosive and approximant pronunciations.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; text-align: center;\"\n|+ Consonant phonemes<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Mart\u00ednez-Celdr\u00e1n|Fern\u00e1ndez-Planas|Carrera-Sabat\u00e9|2003|p=255}}</ref>\n|-\n!\n! colspan=2 | [[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n! colspan=2 | [[Dental consonant|Dental]]\n! colspan=2 | [[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! colspan=2 | [[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n! colspan=2 | [[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n|-\n!

The ''tendencies'' of stress assignment are as follows:<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Eddington|2000|p=96}}</ref>\n* In words that end with a vowel, stress most often falls on the penultimate syllable.\n* In words that end with a consonant, stress most often falls on the last syllable, with the following exceptions: The grammatical endings {{lang|es|-n}} (for third-person-plural of verbs) and {{lang|es|-s}} (whether for plural of nouns and adjectives or for second-person-singular of verbs) do not change the location of stress. Thus, regular ''verbs'' ending with {{lang|es|-n}} and the great majority of words ending with {{lang|es|-s}} are stressed on the penult. Although a significant number of nouns and adjectives ending with {{lang|es|-n}} are also stressed on the penult ({{lang|es|joven}}, {{lang|es|virgen}}, {{lang|es|mitin}}), the great majority of nouns and adjectives ending with {{lang|es|-n}} are stressed on their last syllable ({{lang|es|capit\u00e1n}}, {{lang|es|almac\u00e9n}}, {{lang|es|jard\u00edn}}, {{lang|es|coraz\u00f3n}}).\n* Preantepenultimate stress (stress on the fourth-to-last syllable) occurs rarely, only on verbs with [[clitic]] pronouns attached ({{lang|es|guard\u00e1ndoselos}} 'saving them for him/her/them/you').\n\nIn addition to the many exceptions to these tendencies, there are numerous [[minimal pair]]s that contrast solely on stress such as {{lang|es|s\u00e1bana}} ('sheet') and {{lang|es|sabana}} ('savannah'); {{lang|es|l\u00edmite}} ('boundary'), {{lang|es|limite}} ('[that] he/she limits') and {{lang|es|limit\u00e9}} ('I limited'); {{lang|es|l\u00edquido}} ('liquid'), {{lang|es|liquido}} ('I sell off') and {{lang|es|liquid\u00f3}} ('he/she sold off').\n\nThe orthographic system unambiguously reflects where the stress occurs: in the absence of an accent mark, the stress falls on the last syllable unless the last letter is {{angle bracket|n}}, {{angle bracket|s}}, or a vowel, in which cases the stress falls on the next-to-last (penultimate) syllable. Exceptions to those rules are indicated by an acute accent mark over the vowel of the stressed syllable.

The variant is very similar to Mexican Spanish, because of Mexican and Latin American emigration to the Spanish East Indies over the years. \nFrom 1565 to 1821, the Philippines, which were a part of the Spanish East Indies, were governed by the Captaincy General of the Philippines as a territory of the Viceroyalty of New Spain centered in Mexico. It was only administered directly from Spain in 1821 after Mexico gained its independence that same year. Since the Philippines was a former territory of the Viceroyalty of New Spain for most of the Spanish colonial period, Spanish as was spoken in the Philippines had a greater affinity to American Spanish rather than to Peninsular Spanish. \n\n====Chavacano====\n{{main article|Chavacano}}\nChavacano or Chabacano [t\u0283a\u03b2a\u02c8kano] is a group of Spanish-based creole language varieties spoken in the Philippines.

the main dialects of Spanish.]]\n{{Main|Spanish dialects and varieties}}\nThere are important variations ([[Phonology|phonological]], [[Grammar|grammatical]], and [[Lexicon|lexical]]) in the spoken Spanish of the various regions of Spain and throughout the Spanish-speaking areas of the Americas.\n\nThe variety with the most speakers is [[Mexican Spanish]]. It is spoken by more than twenty percent of the world's Spanish speakers (more than 112 million of the total of more than 500 million, according to the table above). One of its main features is the [[vowel reduction|reduction]] or loss of [[unstressed vowel]]s, mainly when they are in contact with the sound /s/.<ref>Eleanor Greet Cotton, John M. Sharp (1988) ''Spanish in the Americas, Volume 2'', pp.154\u2013155, [https://books.google.com/books?id=89KX2RC6Gx0C&pg=PA154&dq=Mexican+vowels&client=firefox-a#v=onepage&q=Mexican%20vowels&f=false URL]</ref><ref>Lope Blanch, Juan M.

Even so, the speech of Madrid, which has typically southern features such as [[ye\u00edsmo]] and s-aspiration, is the standard variety for use on radio and television.<ref>{{cite book |title=Random House Unabridged Dictionary |year=2006 |publisher= Random House Inc. }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |year=2006 |edition=4th |publisher= Houghton Mifflin Company }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary |year=1998 |publisher= MICRA, Inc. }}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861595345/Castilian.html |title=Encarta World English Dictionary |accessdate=5 August 2008 |year=2007 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing Plc. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831041048/http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861595345/Castilian.html |archivedate=31 August 2009 |df= }}</ref> However, the variety used in the media is that of Madrid's educated classes, where southern traits are less evident, in contrast with the variety spoken by working-class Madrid, where those traits are pervasive. The educated variety of Madrid is indicated by many as the one that has most influenced the written standard for Spanish.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Penny |first1=Ralph |title= Variation and Change in Spanish |year= 2000 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-78045-4 |page= 199 |quote= ''whatever might be claimed by other centres, such as Valladolid, it was educated varieties of Madrid Spanish that were mostly regularly reflected in the written standard.''}}</ref>\n\n=== Phonology ===\nThe four main phonological divisions are based respectively on (1) the phoneme [[Voiceless dental fricative|{{IPA|/\u03b8/}}]] (\"theta\"), (2) the [[debuccalization]] of syllable-final {{IPA|/s/}}, (3) the sound of the spelled {{angle bracket|s}}, (4) and the phoneme [[Palatal lateral approximant|{{IPA|/\u028e/}}]] (\"turned ''y''\"),<ref>The [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] symbol \"turned ''y''\" (\u028e), with its \"tail\" leaning to the right, resembles, but is technically different from, the Greek letter lambda (\u03bb), whose tail leans to the left.</ref>\n* The phoneme {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} (spelled {{lang|es|c}} before {{lang|es|e}} or {{lang|es|i}} and spelled {{angle bracket|z}} elsewhere), a [[voiceless dental fricative]] as in English '''''th'''ing'', is maintained by a majority of Spain's population, especially in the northern and central parts of the country. In other areas (some parts of southern Spain, the [[Canary Islands]], and the Americas), {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} doesn't exist and {{IPA|/s/}} occurs instead. The maintenance of phonemic contrast is called {{lang|es|[[distinci\u00f3n]]}} in Spanish, while the merger is generally called {{lang|es|[[seseo]]}} (in reference to the usual realization of the merged phoneme as {{IPA|[s]}}) or, occasionally, {{lang|es|[[ceceo]]}} (referring to its interdental realization, {{IPA|[\u03b8]}}, in some parts of southern Spain). In most of Hispanic America, the spelled {{angle bracket|c}} before {{angle bracket|e}} or {{angle bracket|i}}, and spelled {{angle bracket|z}} is always pronounced as a [[Voiceless alveolar sibilant#Dentalized laminal alveolar|voiceless dental sibilant]].\n* The debuccalization (pronunciation as {{IPA|[h]}}, or loss) of syllable-final {{IPA|/s/}} is associated with the southern half of Spain and lowland Americas: Central America (except central Costa Rica and Guatemala), the Caribbean, coastal areas of southern Mexico, and South America except Andean highlands. Debuccalization is frequently called \"aspiration\" in English, and {{lang|es|aspiraci\u00f3n}} in Spanish. When there is no debuccalization, the syllable-final {{IPA|/s/}} is pronounced as [[Voiceless alveolar sibilant#Retracted alveolar|voiceless \"apico-alveolar\" sibilant]] or as a [[Voiceless alveolar sibilant#Dentalized laminal alveolar|voiceless dental sibilant]] in the same fashion as in the next paragraph.\n* The sound that corresponds to the letter {{angle bracket|s}} is pronounced in northern and central Spain as a [[Voiceless alveolar sibilant#Retracted alveolar|voiceless \"apico-alveolar\" sibilant]] {{IPA|[s\u033a]}} (also described acoustically as \"[[Grave and acute|grave]]\" and articulatorily as \"retracted\"), with a weak \"hushing\" sound reminiscent of {{lcons|retroflex}} fricatives. In [[Andalusia]], [[Canary Islands]] and most of Hispanic America (except in the [[Colombian Spanish#Paisa dialect|Paisa region]] of Colombia) it is pronounced as a [[Voiceless alveolar sibilant#Dentalized laminal alveolar|voiceless dental sibilant]] {{IPA|[s]}}, much like the most frequent pronunciation of the /s/ of English. Because /s/ is one of the most frequent phonemes in Spanish, the difference of pronunciation is one of the first to be noted by a Spanish-speaking person to differentiate Spaniards from Spanish-speakers of the Americas.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n* The phoneme {{IPA|/\u028e/}} spelled {{angle bracket|ll}}, [[Palatal lateral approximant|palatal lateral]] consonant sometimes compared in sound to the sound of the {{angle bracket|lli}} of English ''million'', tends to be maintained in less-urbanized areas of northern Spain and in [[Andean Spanish|highland areas of South America]]. Meanwhile, in the speech of most other Spanish-speakers, it is merged with {{IPA|/\u029d/}} (\"curly-tail ''j''\"), a non-lateral, usually voiced, usually fricative, palatal consonant, sometimes compared to English {{IPA|/j/}} (''yod'') as in '''''y'''acht'' and spelled {{angle bracket|y}} in Spanish. As with other forms of allophony across world languages, the small difference of the spelled {{angle bracket|ll}} and the spelled {{angle bracket|y}} is usually not perceived (the difference is not heard) by people who do not produce them as different phonemes. Such a phonemic merger is called {{lang|es|[[ye\u00edsmo]]}} in Spanish. In [[Rioplatense Spanish]], the merged phoneme is generally pronounced as a postalveolar fricative, either voiced {{IPA|[\u0292]}} (as in English ''measure'' or the French {{angle bracket|j}}) in the central and western parts of the dialectal region ({{lang|es|zhe\u00edsmo}}), or voiceless {{IPA|[\u0283]}} (as in the French {{angle bracket|ch}} or Portuguese {{angle bracket|x}}) in and around Buenos Aires and Montevideo ({{lang|es|she\u00edsmo}}).<ref>Charles B.

The use of {{lang|es|vos}} (and/or its verb forms) is called {{lang|es|[[voseo]]}}. In a few dialects, all three pronouns are used, with {{lang|es|usted}}, {{lang|es|t\u00fa}}, and {{lang|es|vos}} denoting respectively formality, familiarity, and intimacy.<ref name=\"rae.es site\">{{cite web|url=http://buscon.rae.es/dpdI/ |title=Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola |language= es |publisher=Buscon.rae.es |date= |accessdate=21 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn {{lang|es|voseo}}, {{lang|es|vos}} is the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] form ({{lang|es|vos dec\u00eds}}, \"you say\") and the form for the object of a [[Preposition and postposition|preposition]] ({{lang|es|voy con vos}}, \"I am going with you\"), while the direct and indirect [[Object (grammar)|object]] forms, and the [[Possessive adjective|possessives]], are the same as those associated with {{lang|es|t\u00fa}}: {{lang|es|Vos sab\u00e9s que tus amigos te respetan}} (\"You know your friends respect you\").\n\nThe verb forms of ''general voseo'' are the same as those used with {{lang|es|t\u00fa}} except in the present [[grammatical tense|tense]] ([[indicative]] and [[imperative mood|imperative]]) verbs. The forms for {{lang|es|vos}} generally can be derived from those of {{lang|es|vosotros}} (the traditional second-person familiar ''plural'') by deleting the [[semivowel|glide]] {{IPA|[i\u032f]}}, or {{IPA|/d/}}, where it appears in the ending: {{lang|es|vosotros pens\u00e1'''i'''s}} > {{lang|es|vos pens\u00e1s}}; {{lang|es|vosotros volv\u00e9'''i'''s}} > {{lang|es|vos volv\u00e9s}}, {{lang|es|pensa'''d'''!}} ({{lang|es|vosotros}}) > {{lang|es|pens\u00e1!}} ({{lang|es|vos}}), {{lang|es|volve'''d'''!}} ({{lang|es|vosotros}}) > {{lang|es|volv\u00e9!}} ({{lang|es|vos}}) .\n{| cellpadding=\"5\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ General voseo <small>([[Rioplatense Spanish|River Plate Spanish]])</small>\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Indicative\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Subjunctive\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Imperative\n|-\n!

Generally, it can be said that there are zones of exclusive use of {{lang|es|tuteo}} (the use of {{lang|es|t\u00fa}}) in the following areas: almost all of [[Mexico]], the West Indies, [[Panama]], most of [[Colombia]], [[Peru]], [[Venezuela]] and coastal [[Ecuador]].\n\n{{lang|es|Tuteo}} as a cultured form alternates with {{lang|es|voseo}} as a popular or rural form in [[Bolivia]], in the north and south of Peru, in Andean Ecuador, in small zones of the Venezuelan Andes (and most notably in the Venezuelan state of [[Zulia]]), and in a large part of Colombia. Some researchers maintain that {{lang|es|voseo}} can be heard in some parts of eastern Cuba, and others assert that it is absent from the island.<ref>Katia Salamanca de Abreu, [http://cvc.cervantes.es/lengua/thesaurus/pdf/28/TH_28_001_138_0.pdf review of Humberto L\u00f3pez Morales, ''Estudios sobre el espa\u00f1ol de Cuba''] (New York: Editorial Las Am\u00e9ricas, 1970), in ''Thesaurus'', 28 (1973), 138\u2013146.</ref>\n\n{{lang|es|Tuteo}} exists as the second-person usage with an intermediate degree of formality alongside the more familiar {{lang|es|voseo}} in [[Chile]], in the Venezuelan state of [[Zulia]], on the Caribbean coast of [[Colombia]], in the [[Azuero Peninsula]] in Panama, in the Mexican state of [[Chiapas]], and in parts of Guatemala.\n\nAreas of generalized {{lang|es|voseo}} include [[Argentina]], [[Nicaragua]], eastern [[Bolivia]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Paraguay]], [[Uruguay]] and the Colombian departments of [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]], [[Caldas Department|Caldas]], [[Risaralda Department|Risaralda]], [[Quindio]] and [[Valle del Cauca]].<ref name=\"rae.es site\" />\n\n==== Ustedes ====\n{{lang|es|Ustedes}} functions as formal and informal second person plural in over 90% of the Spanish-speaking world, including all of Hispanic America, the [[Canary Islands]], and some regions of [[Andalusia]]. In [[Seville]], [[Huelva]], [[Cadiz]], and other parts of western [[Andalusia]], the familiar form is constructed as {{lang|es|ustedes vais}}, using the traditional second-person plural form of the verb. Most of Spain maintains the [[T-V distinction|formal/familiar distinction]] with {{lang|es|ustedes}} and {{lang|es|vosotros}} respectively.\n\n==== Usted ====\n{{lang|es|Usted}} is the usual second-person singular pronoun in a formal context, but it is used jointly with the third-person singular voice of the verb. It is used to convey respect toward someone who is a generation older or is of higher authority (\"you, sir\"/\"you, ma'am\"). It is also used in a ''familiar'' context by many speakers in Colombia and Costa Rica and in parts of Ecuador and Panama, to the exclusion of {{lang|es|t\u00fa}} or {{lang|es|vos}}. This usage is sometimes called {{lang|es|[[:es:Ustedeo|ustedeo]]}} in Spanish.\n\nIn Central America, especially in Honduras, {{lang|es|usted}} is often used as a formal pronoun to convey respect between the members of a romantic couple. {{lang|es|Usted}} is also used that way between parents and children in the Andean regions of Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela.\n\n==== Third-person object pronouns ====\nMost speakers use (and the {{lang|es|[[Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola]]}} prefers) the pronouns {{lang|es|lo}} and {{lang|es|la}} for [[Direct object#The object in linguistics|''direct'' objects]] (masculine and feminine respectively, regardless of [[animacy]], meaning \"him\", \"her\", or \"it\"), and {{lang|es|le}} for [[Direct object#The object in linguistics|''indirect'' objects]] (regardless of [[Grammatical gender|gender]] or [[animacy]], meaning \"to him\", \"to her\", or \"to it\"). The usage is sometimes called \"etymological\", as these direct and indirect object pronouns are a continuation, respectively, of the [[Accusative case|accusative]] and [[Dative case|dative]] pronouns of Latin, the ancestor language of Spanish.\n\nDeviations from this norm (more common in Spain than in the Americas) are called \"{{lang|es|[[le\u00edsmo]]}}\", \"{{lang|es|[[lo\u00edsmo]]}}\", or \"{{lang|es|[[la\u00edsmo]]}}\", according to which respective pronoun, {{lang|es|le}}, {{lang|es|lo}}, or {{lang|es|la}}, has expanded beyond the etymological usage ({{lang|es|le}} as a direct object, or {{lang|es|lo}} or {{lang|es|la}} as an indirect object).\n\n=== Vocabulary ===\nSome words can be significantly different in different Hispanophone countries. Most Spanish speakers can recognize other Spanish forms even in places where they are not commonly used, but Spaniards generally do not recognize specifically American usages. For example, Spanish {{lang|es|mantequilla}}, {{lang|es|aguacate}} and {{lang|es|albaricoque}} (respectively, 'butter', 'avocado', 'apricot') correspond to {{lang|es|manteca}} (word used for [[lard]] in [[Peninsular Spanish]]), {{lang|es|palta}}, and {{lang|es|damasco}}, respectively, in Argentina, Chile (except {{lang|es|manteca}}), Paraguay, Peru (except {{lang|es|manteca}} and {{lang|es|damasco}}), and Uruguay.\n\n== Relation to other languages ==\n{{further|Comparison of Portuguese and Spanish}}\nSpanish is closely related to the other [[West Iberian languages|West Iberian Romance languages]], including [[Asturian language|Asturian]], [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Ladino language|Ladino]], [[Leonese Language|Leonese]], [[Mirandese language|Mirandese]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].\n\nIt is generally acknowledged that Portuguese and Spanish speakers can communicate in written form, with varying degrees of mutual intelligibility.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Jensen|1989}}</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Penny|2000|p=14}}</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Dalby|1998|p=501}}</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Ginsburgh|Weber|2011|p=90}}</ref>\n[[Mutual intelligibility]] of the ''written'' Spanish and Portuguese languages is remarkably high, and the difficulties of the spoken forms are based more on phonology than on grammatical and lexical dissimilarities. ''[[Ethnologue]]'' gives estimates of the [[lexical similarity]] between related languages in terms of precise percentages. For Spanish and Portuguese, that figure is 89%. Italian, on the other hand its phonology similar to Spanish, but has a lower lexical similarity of 82%. Mutual intelligibility between Spanish and [[French language|French]] or between Spanish and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] is lower still, given lexical similarity ratings of 75% and 71% respectively.<ref name=\"ethnologue\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=spa|title=Spanish|work=Ethnologue}}</ref><ref name=\"ezglot\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ezglot.com/most-similar-languages.php?l=spa|title=Similar languages to Spanish|work=EZGlot}}</ref> And comprehension of Spanish by French speakers who have not studied the language is much lower, at an estimated 45%. In general, thanks to the common features of the writing systems of the Romance languages, interlingual comprehension of the written word is greater than that of oral communication.\n\nThe following table compares the forms of some common words in several Romance languages:\n<div style=\"overflow:auto;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Other theories suggest, on the basis of what is used to make cheese, a derivation from Latin ''brandeum'' (originally meaning a linen covering, later a thin cloth for relic storage) through an intermediate root *''brandea''. For the development of the meaning, cf. Spanish ''manteca'', Portuguese ''manteiga'', probably from Latin ''mantica'' ('sack'), Italian ''formaggio'' and French ''fromage'' from ''formaticus''.

Therefore, its relationship to Spanish is comparable with that of the [[Yiddish language]] to [[German language|German]]. Ladino speakers today are almost exclusively [[Sephardim|Sephardi]] Jews, with family roots in Turkey, Greece, or the Balkans, and living mostly in Israel, Turkey, and the United States, with a few communities in Hispanic America.<ref name=\"Ladino\" /> Judaeo-Spanish lacks the [[Amerindian languages|Native American vocabulary]] which was acquired by standard Spanish during the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonial period]], and it retains many archaic features which have since been lost in standard Spanish. It contains, however, other vocabulary which is not found in standard Spanish, including vocabulary from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], French, Greek and [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and other languages spoken where the Sephardim settled.\n\nJudaeo-Spanish is in serious danger of extinction because many native speakers today are elderly as well as elderly ''olim'' (immigrants to [[Israel]]) who have not transmitted the language to their children or grandchildren. However, it is experiencing a minor revival among Sephardi communities, especially in music. In the case of the Latin American communities, the danger of extinction is also due to the risk of assimilation by modern Castilian.\n\nA related dialect is [[Haketia]], the Judaeo-Spanish of northern Morocco. This too tended to assimilate with modern Spanish, during the Spanish occupation of the region.\n\n== Writing system ==\n{{Main|Spanish orthography}}\n{{Spanish language}}\nSpanish is written in the [[Latin script]], with the addition of the character {{angle bracket|[[\u00f1]]}} ({{lang|es|e\u00f1e}}, representing the phoneme {{IPA|/[[Palatal nasal|\u0272]]/}}, a letter distinct from {{angle bracket|n}}, although typographically composed of an {{angle bracket|n}} with a [[tilde]]). Formerly the [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] {{angle bracket|ch}} ({{lang|es|che}}, representing the phoneme {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0283/}}) and {{angle bracket|ll}} ({{lang|es|elle}}, representing the phoneme {{IPA|/[[Palatal lateral approximant|\u028e]]/}}), were also considered single letters. However, the digraph {{angle bracket|rr}} ({{lang|es|erre fuerte}}, 'strong r', {{lang|es|erre doble}}, 'double r', or simply {{lang|es|erre}}), which also represents a distinct phoneme {{IPA|/r/}}, was not similarly regarded as a single letter. Since 1994 {{angle bracket|ch}} and {{angle bracket|ll}} have been treated as letter pairs for [[collation]] purposes, though they remained a part of the alphabet until 2010. Words with {{angle bracket|ch}} are now alphabetically sorted between those with {{angle bracket|cg}} and {{angle bracket|ci}}, instead of following {{angle bracket|cz}} as they used to. The situation is similar for {{angle bracket|ll}}.<ref>[http://buscon.rae.es/dpdI/SrvltConsulta?lema=ch Diccionario Panhisp\u00e1nico de Dudas], 1st ed.</ref><ref>[http://www.rae.es/ Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola], [http://www.spanishpronto.com/spanishpronto/spanishalphabet.html Explanation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070906105503/https://www.spanishpronto.com/spanishpronto/spanishalphabet.html |date=6 September 2007 }} at [http://www.spanishpronto.com/ Spanish Pronto] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914002335/https://www.spanishpronto.com/ |date=14 September 2007 }} {{in lang|es|en}}</ref>\n\nThus, the Spanish alphabet has the following 27 letters:\n\n:{{lang|es|A, B, C,<!-- ch considered digraph - see next references. --> D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L,<!-- ll considered digraph - see next references. --> M, N, \u00d1, O, P, Q, R, <!-- but not rr See previous paragraph. --> S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.}}\n\nSince 2010, none of the digraphs ({{lang|es|ch, ll, rr, gu, qu}}) is considered a letter by the Spanish Royal Academy.<ref>[http://www.rae.es/consultas/exclusion-de-ch-y-ll-del-abecedario Exclusi\u00f3n de ch y ll del abecedario, RAE]</ref>\n\nThe letters {{lang|es|k}} and {{lang|es|w}} are used only in words and names coming from foreign languages ({{lang|es|kilo, folklore, whisky, kiwi}}, etc.).\n\nWith the exclusion of a very small number of regional terms such as {{lang|es|[[M\u00e9xico]]}} (see [[Toponymy of Mexico#Phonetic evolution|Toponymy of Mexico]]), pronunciation can be entirely determined from spelling. Under the orthographic conventions, a typical Spanish word is stressed on the [[syllable]] before the last if it ends with a vowel (not including {{angle bracket|y}}) or with a vowel followed by {{angle bracket|n}} or an {{angle bracket|s}}; it is stressed on the last syllable otherwise. Exceptions to this rule are indicated by placing an [[acute accent]] on the [[stress (linguistics)|stressed vowel]].\n\nThe acute accent is used, in addition, to distinguish between certain [[homophone]]s, especially when one of them is a stressed word and the other one is a [[clitic]]: compare {{lang|es|el}} ('the', masculine singular definite article) with {{lang|es|\u00e9l}} ('he' or 'it'), or {{lang|es|te}} ('you', object pronoun) with {{lang|es|t\u00e9}} ('tea'), {{lang|es|de}} (preposition 'of') versus {{lang|es|d\u00e9}} ('give' [formal imperative/third-person present subjunctive]), and {{lang|es|se}} (reflexive pronoun) versus {{lang|es|s\u00e9}} ('I know' or imperative 'be').\n\nThe interrogative pronouns ({{lang|es|qu\u00e9}}, {{lang|es|cu\u00e1l}}, {{lang|es|d\u00f3nde}}, {{lang|es|qui\u00e9n}}, etc.) also receive accents in direct or indirect questions, and some demonstratives ({{lang|es|\u00e9se}}, {{lang|es|\u00e9ste}}, {{lang|es|aqu\u00e9l}}, etc.) can be accented when used as pronouns. Accent marks used to be omitted on capital letters (a widespread practice in the days of [[typewriter]]s and the early days of computers when only lowercase vowels were available with accents), although the {{lang|es|Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola}} advises against this and the orthographic conventions taught at schools enforce the use of the accent.\n\nWhen {{lang|es|u}} is written between {{lang|es|g}} and a front vowel {{lang|es|e}} or {{lang|es|i}}, it indicates a \"[[Hard and soft G|hard g]]\" pronunciation. A [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] {{lang|es|\u00fc}} indicates that it is not silent as it normally would be (e.g., {{lang|es|cig\u00fce\u00f1a}}, 'stork', is pronounced {{IPA|[\u03b8i\u02c8\u0263we\u0272a]}}; if it were written *{{lang|es|cigue\u00f1a}}, it would be pronounced *{{IPA|[\u03b8i\u02c8\u0263e\u0272a]}}).\n\nInterrogative and exclamatory clauses are introduced with [[inverted question and exclamation marks]] ({{lang|es|\u00bf}} and {{lang|es|\u00a1}}, respectively).\n\n== Organizations ==\n[[File:Academia de la Lengua.jpg|thumb|The [[Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola|Royal Spanish Academy]] Headquarters in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]].]]\n\n=== Royal Spanish Academy ===\n{{main|Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola}}\n[[File:Coat of Arms of the Royal Spanish Academy.svg|left|thumb|upright=0.27|Arms of the Royal Spanish Academy]]\nThe {{lang|es|Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola}} (Royal Spanish Academy), founded in 1713,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.uwaterloo.ca/society/history/1713rae.html |title=Scholarly Societies Project |publisher=Lib.uwaterloo.ca |date= |accessdate=6 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923234545/http://www.lib.uwaterloo.ca/society/history/1713rae.html |archivedate=23 September 2010 }}</ref> together with the 21 other national ones (see [[Association of Spanish Language Academies]]), exercises a standardizing influence through its publication of dictionaries and widely respected grammar and style guides.<ref>{{cite book|last=Batchelor|first=Ronald Ernest|title=Using Spanish: a guide to contemporary usage|year=1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-26987-3|page=318|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eEWZL1j9ig8C&pg=PA4&dq=real+academia+espa%C3%B1ola+recognized#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\nBecause of influence and for other sociohistorical reasons, a standardized form of the language ([[Standard Spanish]]) is widely acknowledged for use in literature, academic contexts and the media.\n\n=== Association of Spanish Language Academies ===\n{{main|Association of Spanish Language Academies}}\n[[File:Pa\u00edses con academia de la lengua espa\u00f1ola.png|thumb|Countries members of the ASALE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asale.org/ASALE/asale.html |title=Association of Spanish Language Academies |language=Spanish |publisher=Asale |accessdate=5 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923155313/http://asale.org/ASALE/asale.html |archivedate=23 September 2010 }}</ref>]]\nThe Association of Spanish Language Academies ({{lang|es|Asociaci\u00f3n de Academias de la Lengua Espa\u00f1ola}}, or {{lang|es|ASALE}}) is the entity which regulates the Spanish language.

headquarters, [[Madrid]]]]\nThe {{lang|es|Instituto Cervantes}} (Cervantes Institute) is a worldwide nonprofit organization created by the Spanish government in 1991. This organization has branched out in over 20 different countries, with 75 centers devoted to the Spanish and Hispanic American cultures and Spanish language. The ultimate goals of the Institute are to promote universally the education, the study, and the use of Spanish as a second language, to support methods and activities that help the process of Spanish-language education, and to contribute to the advancement of the Spanish and Hispanic American cultures in non-Spanish-speaking countries. The Institute's 2015 report \"El espa\u00f1ol, una lengua viva\" (Spanish, a living language) estimated that there were 559 million Spanish speakers worldwide. Its latest annual report \"[https://www.cervantes.es/sobre_instituto_cervantes/prensa/2018/noticias/np_presentacion-anuario.htm El espa\u00f1ol en el mundo 2018]\" (Spanish in the world 2018) counts 577 million Spanish speakers worldwide. Among the sources cited in the report is the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], which estimates that the U.S. will have 138 million Spanish speakers by 2050, making it the biggest Spanish-speaking nation on earth, with Spanish the mother tongue of almost a third of its citizens.<ref>Stephen Burgen, [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/29/us-second-biggest-spanish-speaking-country US now has more Spanish speakers than Spain \u2013 only Mexico has more], US News, 29 June 2015.</ref>\n\n=== Official use by international organizations ===\n{{Main|List of countries where Spanish is an official language#International organizations where Spanish is official}}\n\nSpanish is one of the official languages of the [[United Nations]], the [[European Union]], the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[Organization of American States]], the [[Organization of Ibero-American States]], the [[African Union]], the [[Union of South American Nations]], the [[Antarctic Treaty Secretariat]], the [[Latin Union]], the [[Caricom]], the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], and numerous other international organizations.\n{{clear right}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Language}}\n{{col-start-fixed|width=calc(100% \u2013 256px)}}\n{{col-break}}\n* [[List of Spanish-language poets]]\n* [[Fund\u00e9u BBVA]]\n* [[Spanish as a second or foreign language]]\n\n; Spanish words and phrases\n* [[Longest word in Spanish]]\n* [[Most common words in Spanish]]\n* [[Spanish profanity]]\n* [[Spanish proverbs]]\n* [[List of English\u2013Spanish interlingual homographs]]\n* [[Cuento]]\n\n; [[Hispanosphere|Spanish-speaking world]]\n* [[List of countries where Spanish is an official language|Countries where Spanish is an official language]]\n* [[Hispanic culture]]\n* [[Hispanicization]]\n* [[Hispanidad]]\n* [[Hispanism]]\n* [[Hispanosphere]]\n* [[Panhispanism]]\n{{col-break}}\n; [[Influences on the Spanish language]]\n* [[Arabic influence on the Spanish language]]\n* [[List of Spanish words of Germanic origin]]\n* [[List of Spanish words of Nahuatl origin]]\n* [[List of Spanish words of Indigenous American Indian origin]]\n* [[List of Spanish words of Philippine origin]]\n; [[Spanish-based creole languages|Dialects and languages influenced by Spanish]]\n* [[Cal\u00f3 language|Cal\u00f3]]\n* [[Chamorro language|Chamorro]]\n* [[Chavacano]]\n* [[Frespa\u00f1ol]]\n* [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]]\n* [[Llanito]]\n* [[Palenquero]]\n* [[Papiamento]]\n* [[Philippine languages]]\n* [[Portu\u00f1ol]]\n* [[Spanglish]]\n* [[Spanish-based creole languages]]\n* [[List of English words of Spanish origin]]\n{{col-break}}\n; [[Spanish dialects and varieties]]\n* '''European Spanish'''\n** [[Peninsular Spanish]]\n*** [[Andalusian Spanish]]\n*** [[Castilian Spanish]]\n*** [[Castrapo]] (Galician Spanish)\n*** [[Cast\u00fao]] (Extremaduran Spanish)\n*** [[Murcian Spanish]]\n** Insular Spanish\n*** [[Canarian Spanish]]\n* '''[[Spanish language in the Americas|Spanish in the Americas]]'''\n** [[North American Spanish]]\n** [[Central American Spanish]]\n** [[Caribbean Spanish]]\n** [[Spanish language in South America|South American Spanish]]\n** [[Spanish language in the United States|Spanish in the United States]]\n* '''Spanish in Africa'''\n** [[Equatoguinean Spanish]]\n** [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]]\n* '''Spanish in Asia'''\n** [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish in the Philippines]]<ref>A First Spanish Reader, by Erwin W.

The club's form quickly improved, securing its continued Premier League status on the last day of the season.

The club's form quickly improved, securing its continued Premier League status on the last day of the season.
