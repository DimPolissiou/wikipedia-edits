His father was a [[stonemason]], which led to Connor's jobs in New York as a sign painter, stonecutter, bronze founder, and machinist. Inspired by his father's work and his own experience, Connor used to steal his father's chisels as a child and carve figures into rocks.\n\nIn 1899, he moved into the [[Roycroft Institution]] where he helped with [[blacksmithing]] and eventually began making [[terracotta]] busts and reliefs. During four years at Roycroft, he became well known as a sculptor, and was commissioned to create civic works in bronze for placement in Washington, D.C., [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], [[East Aurora, New York]], San Francisco, and Ireland.\n\nIn 1925, he moved back to Ireland and opened his own studio in [[Dublin]], but found few patrons and his work slowed.

The [[President of the Philippines|president]], [[Vice President of the Philippines|vice-president]], and the [[List of members of the 15th Congress of the Philippines#Senate|senators]] are elected for a six-year term, while the [[List of members of the 15th Congress of the Philippines#House of Representatives|members of the House of Representatives]], [[List of Governors in the Philippines|governors]], vice-governors, [[Sangguniang Panlalawigan|members of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan]] (provincial board members), [[mayor]]s, [[Deputy mayor|vice-mayors]], [[Sangguniang Panlungsod|members of the Sangguniang Panlungsod]]/[[Sangguniang Bayan|members of the Sangguniang Bayan]] (city/municipal councilors), [[barangay]] officials, and the [[Sangguniang Kabataan|members of the Sangguniang Kabataan]] (youth councilors) are elected to serve for a three-year term.\n\nThe [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] or ''Kongreso'' has [[Bicameralism|two chambers]]. The [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] or ''Kapulungan ng mga Kinatawan'' has 292 seats {{as of|2013|lc=yes}}, of which 80% are contested in single seat [[electoral district]]s and 20% are allotted to party-lists according to a modified [[Hare quota]] with remainders disregarded and a three-seat cap. These party list seats are only accessible to marginalized and under-represented groups and parties, local parties, and sectoral wings of major parties that represent the marginalized. The [[Constitution of the Philippines]] allows the House of Representatives to have more than 250 members by statute without a need for a [[constitutional amendment]]. The Senate or ''Senado'' has 24 members who are elected on a nationwide [[at-large]] basis; they do not represent any geographical district. Half of the Senate is renewed every three years.\n\nThe Philippines has a [[Multi-party system|multi-party]] system, with numerous [[Political party|parties]] in which no one party normally has a chance of gaining power alone, and parties must work with each other to form a [[coalition government]]. The [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] (COMELEC) is responsible for running the elections.\n\nUnder the Constitution, elections for the members of Congress and local positions (except barangay officials) occur every second [[Monday|Monday]] of [[May|May]] every third year after May [[1992|1992]], and presidential and vice presidential elections occur every second Monday of May every sixth year after May 1992. All elected officials, except those at the barangay level, start (and end) their terms of office on [[June|June]] 30 of the election year.\n\n==Voting==\n\n===Qualification===\nEvery citizen 18 years old or above on Election Day who has been a resident of the [[Philippines|Philippines]] for at least a year and for at least six months in the place where she or he is registered, and who is not otherwise disqualified by law, may vote. In order to actually vote, a citizen has to [[Voter registration in the Philippines|register]]. The COMELEC has a registration period of several months prior to the election. Those who are not registered do not appear on the voters' list and are ineligible to vote despite being otherwise qualified to do so.\n\nPeople aged 15 to 18 may vote in [[Sangguniang Kabataan]] elections. As with their adult counterparts, the COMELEC has a registration period a few months prior to the election.\n\n===Absentee voters===\n[[Absentee ballot|Absentee voters]] are divided into two types: the local absentee voters and the overseas absentee voters. Local absentee voters include people who are working during Election Day. These include soldiers, policemen, government employees and the like. Overseas absentee voters are [[Overseas Filipinos|Filipinos residing abroad]]. They are eligible to vote on national positions only (president, vice-president, senators and party-list representatives). Overseas absentee voters may vote in Philippine embassies and consulates, and voting begins as early as 4 months prior to the election. The voting can be as long as 6 months in a very few situations.\n\n===Process===\n[[File:Ballot boxes.jpg|thumb|[[Ballot boxes]] used for the [[2007 Philippine barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan elections|2007 Philippine Barangay Elections]] in [[Davao City|Davao]].]]\n{{main|Electoral process in the Philippines}}\nOnce a registered voter finds his/her name in the voters' list and locates the correct precinct, he may queue in line for the distribution of the ballot.\n\nPrior to the [[2010 Philippine general election|2010 elections]], voters have to write the names of the candidates next to the positions in which they are running. COMELEC-approved nicknames maybe used by the voters in writing the names. After the polling period ends, the Board of Election Inspectors (or the teachers manning the polling precinct) counts the ballots by hand. Once all the ballots are counted, the election returns will now be sent to the city or municipal Board of Canvassers, political parties and other groups.\n\nThe city or municipal Board of Canvassers canvasses the votes from all polling precincts within their jurisdiction and prepares two documents: a Statement of Votes (SOV) in which all votes from all candidates in all positions per precinct is listed; and a Certificate of Canvass (COC), a document showing the vote totals of all candidates within the Board of Canvassers' jurisdiction.\n\nIf the city or municipal Board of Canvassers' jurisdiction is an independent city with its own congressional district, they will send their SOV and COC to the national Board of Canvassers (the COMELEC for senate and party-list elections, [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] for presidential and vice presidential elections). If it is otherwise, they will send their SOV and COC to the provincial Board of Canvassers where the votes as stated from the city or municipal COC will be canvassed. The provincial Board of Canvassers sends their SOV and COC to the national Board of Canvassers once canvassing is done. The national Board of Canvassers then canvasses all COCs and declares the winners for national positions.\n\n===Election automation===\n{{main|Vote counting in the Philippines}}\nSince the 2010 elections, the voters have to shade the oval that was indicated before the candidate's name, and a [[voting machine]] manufactured by [[Smartmatic]] automatically counts each ballot as it is fed into it. The results are then printed as the election return and sent electronically to the city or municipal Board of Canvassers.\n\nIn 2016, for the third time in a row, the Philippines automated their elections using electronic vote counting machines. The deployment of 92,500 of these machines was the largest in the world. [[Brazil]] and [[India]], countries which also use technology to process their votes, employ e-voting instead of an automated count.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Inquirer|first1=News|title=\nSmartmatic: PH now world reference point for automated elections|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/785083/smartmatic-ph-now-world-reference-point-for-automated-elections|accessdate=10 May 2016|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=2016-05-10}}</ref>\n\nFor the 2019 elections, the COMELEC presented its source code for review by accredited U.S. software testing company Pro V&V in an effort to make the automated elections transparent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/12/06/18/2019-polls-source-code-passes-foreign-firm-review-comelec-spokesman|title=2019 polls source code passes foreign firm review: Comelec spokesman|last=News|first=Christian V.

The presidential and vice presidential elections are held every six years. Election Days in which the president and vice president and [[barangay]] officials are not elected are called \"[[midterm election]]s\"; Election Days in which the president and vice president are elected are called \"presidential elections\". Barangay-level officials, although are currently elected in the same year as the other officials, are elected separately the succeeding months (see below).\n\nFrom 1949 to 1971, election days are held every second Tuesday of November of every odd-numbered year with the presidential and vice presidential election held the every fourth year starting from 1951.\n\nBarangay-level elections, starting from 2007, are to be held every three years during the last Monday of October, although these elections are frequently postponed (and incumbents' terms are extended) as a cost-saving measure. Elections for the positions in the [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]] (ARMM), starting from 2011, are to be held every three years during the second Monday of May.\n\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!Position !! 2016 !! 2017 !! 2018 !! 2019 !! 2020 !! 2021 !! 2022\n|-\n!Type\n| Presidential (May)|| None || Barangay (May) || Midterm (May) ||colspan=2|None || Presidential (May) Barangay (December)\n|-\n!President and<br />vice president\n|'''President and vice president''' ||colspan=5|None ||'''President and vice president'''\n|-\n!Senate\n|'''Seats contested during even-numbered years (12 seats)''' ||colspan=2|None ||'''Seats contested during odd-numbered years (12 seats)''' ||colspan=2|None ||'''Seats contested during even-numbered years (12 seats)'''\n|-\n!House of Representatives\n|'''All seats''' ||colspan=2|None ||'''All seats''' ||colspan=2|None ||'''All seats'''\n|-\n!ARMM\n|'''All positions'''||colspan=2|None ||'''All positions''' ||colspan=2|None ||'''All positions'''\n|-\n!Provinces, cities and municipalities\n|'''All positions''' ||colspan=2|None ||'''All positions''' ||colspan=2|None ||'''All positions'''\n|-\n!Barangays\n|colspan=2|None ||'''All positions''' || None ||'''All positions'''||colspan=2|None\n|}\n\n===Inauguration===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!Position !! 2016 !! 2017 !! 2018 !! 2019 !! 2020 !! 2021 !! 2022\n|-\n!Type\n| Presidential (June)|| None || Barangay (June) || Midterm (June) ||colspan=2|None || Presidential (June)\n|-\n!President and<br />vice president\n|'''June 30''' ||colspan=5|None ||'''June 30'''\n|-\n!Senate\n|'''June 30''' ||colspan=2|None ||'''June 30''' ||colspan=2|None ||'''June 30'''\n|-\n!House\n|'''June 30''' ||colspan=2|None ||'''June 30''' ||colspan=2|None ||'''June 30'''\n|-\n!BARMM\n|'''June 30''' ||colspan=2|None ||'''June 30''' ||colspan=2|None ||'''June 30'''\n|-\n!Provinces, cities and municipalities\n|'''June 30''' ||colspan=2|None ||'''June 30''' ||colspan=2|None ||'''June 30'''\n|-\n!Barangays\n|colspan=2|None ||'''June 30''' ||None ||colspan=2|None ||'''TBA''' \n|}\n\n<!--\nVarious acts are allowed and disallowed during the election and campaigning period.

In ARMM elections, a voter may vote for five names, and in barangay elections, a voter may vote for eight names. A voter for the [[Sangguniang Kabataan]] (SK, youth council) may vote for eight names; currently, SK voters are aged 15 to 18 years old with only the SK voters aged 18 years old may vote for other barangay officials.\n\n===President and vice president===\n{{main|Philippine presidential election}}\nEach voter is entitled to one vote ''each'' for the duration of the election. The voter may split his or her ticket. The candidate with the [[First-past-the-post|most votes wins]] the position; there is no [[run-off election]], and the president and vice president may come from different parties. If two or more candidates emerge with an equal and highest number of votes, one of them will be elected by the Senate and the House of Representatives, voting separately.\n\nThe first presidential and vice presidential election in the Philippines was the [[Tejeros Convention]] of 1897; this was for the leadership of the Katipunan, where Aguinaldo was elected as leader. The first presidential election in which the presidency of the Philippines was at stake was in January 1, 1899, when the Malolos Congress of the [[First Philippine Republic]] elected Aguinaldo as president.\n\nThe first presidential election via a [[direct election]] was in [[1935 Philippine presidential election|September 16, 1935]] where Aguinaldo was defeated by [[Manuel L. Quezon]]. The first presidential election in the current constitution was in [[1992 Philippine presidential election|June 30, 1992]] where [[Fidel Ramos]] defeated six other candidates.\n\n===Congress===\n\n====Senators====\n{{main|Philippine senatorial elections}}\nThe Senate has 24 members, and 12 members are elected every election; hence, each voter is entitled to twelve votes for the [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] in every election. The voter may not complete the twelve votes for the Senate, but s/he must not surpass the twelve votes or else his/her ballot for that position will be [[null vote|nullified]]. With the entire country as one [[at-large]] district, the [[Plurality-at-large voting|twelve candidates with the most votes]] are elected. This is often not [[proportional representation|proportional]] to the results.\n\nFrom 1951 to 1971, instead of 12 senators elected every three years, the electorate voted for eight senators every two years in the same format. From 1941 to 1949, all elections to the senate were by block voting: the voters may write a name for every seat contested, or they can write the name of the party, which would then give [[general ticket|all of the voters' votes]] to that party's ticket. Compounded with the [[Nacionalista Party]]'s dominance, this caused a sweep of 24 seats for them in [[1941 Philippine Senate election|1941]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/columns/view/20061120-33603/Block_voting |title=Block voting |first=Manuel III |last=Quezon |authorlink=Manuel Quezon III |publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=2006-11-20 |accessdate=2010-12-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326173220/http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/columns/view/20061120-33603/Block_voting |archive-date=March 26, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> From 1916 to 1934, voting was via [[Senatorial districts of the Philippines|senatorial districts]]; voters vote for one candidate every three years, except for the first election in 1916 where they'd vote for two candidates; the second-placed candidate would only serve for three years.\n\n====House of Representatives====\nEach voter has two votes in the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]].\n\nA voter may [[single member constituency|elect a representative]] from the [[Legislative districts of the Philippines|congressional district]] of residence. The candidate with the highest number of votes in a district wins that district's seat.\n\nA voter may also elect a party-list organization. The voter [[closed list|votes for the party, not for the candidate]], and the voter is restricted to one vote. All votes are tallied in an [[at-large]] basis, and parties with at least 2% of the vote wins at least one seat in the House. A further two more seats will be granted if there are still spare seats (the party-list representatives comprise 20% of the House), and if there are still unfilled seats, the parties with less than 2% of the vote will get one seat each in descending order until all seats are filled. A party-list organization is limited to representing marginalized sectors of society such as youth, laborers, women, and the like.\n\nPreviously, the calculation for the winners in the party-list election was different: the winning parties should have 2% of the national vote and are awarded one seat; any additional 2% is given an additional seat until the maximum of three seats per party is filled up. Since only a few parties surpassed the 2% [[election threshold]], the number of party-list representatives was always less than 20% of the House's membership.\n\nThe party-list system was first used in 1998; from 1987 to 1995, the president with the concurrence of the [[Commission on Appointments (Philippines)|Commission on Appointments]], appointed the sectoral representatives. Sectoral representatives were first elected during [[1978 Philippine parliamentary sectoral election|1978]].\n\nThe first legislative election was the for the Malolos Congress in [[1898 Philippine Malolos Congress elections|June 23\u2013September 10, 1898]]. The first election for an entirely elected body was in [[1907 Philippine Assembly elections|July 30, 1907]]. This was also the first general election in the Philippines.\n\n===Local positions===\n{{main|Local government in the Philippines}}\nSynchronized with the national elections are the local elections. The voter may vote for any of the following:\n*Provincial-level:\n**One governor\n**One vice governor\n**One to seven [[Sangguniang Panlalawigan]] members (provincial board)\n*City- or municipal-level:\n**One mayor\n**One vice mayor\n**Four to twelve [[Sangguniang Panlungsod]]/[[Sangguniang Bayan]] members (city or municipal council, respectively)\nIf the city the voter is residing in a [[Cities of the Philippines#Classification|highly urbanized city or independent component city]], the voter can not vote for any of the provincial-level positions.\n\nThe [[Sangguniang Panlalawigan]] (provincial board), [[Sangguniang Panlungsod]] (city council) and [[Sangguniang Bayan]] (municipal council)'s manner of election is identical with that of the Senate. In some cities and provinces, they are split into districts (not necessarily the same as the congressional district) in which separate board members/council members are elected.\n\n[[Barangay elections]] are held every three years, although usually not in the same time as elections for other positions. Terms of incumbent barangay officials are often extended when Congress suspend the barangay elections as a cost-saving measure. The barangay-level positions are:\n*One [[Punong Barangay|punong barangay]] (barangay captain)\n*Seven [[Barangay Kagawad|barangay kagawads]] (councilors)\n*One [[Sangguniang Kabataan]] (SK) chairperson (youth council chairperson)\n*Seven SK kagawads (councilors)\n\nThe manner of election of the Sangguniang Kabataan in the barangay is identical to the one used in the Senate. Each barangay is entitled to one SK. The barangay SK chairpersons in a city or municipality elect amongst themselves a president that will sit as an ''[[ex officio]]'' member of the city or municipal council. The city (if applicable) and municipal SK presidents then elect amongst themselves a president that will sit in the provincial board as an ''ex officio'' member. Finally, provincial and city (which are not under the jurisdiction of a province) chairpersons elect amongst themselves the SK national federation president that will sit as an ''ex officio'' member of the [[National Youth Commission (Philippines)|National Youth Commission]].\n\nThe manner of representation of the different barangay chairmen in the municipal, city and provincial legislatures as ''ex officio'' members is identical with the way how the SK chairpersons are represented; the provincial and city (which are not under the jurisdiction of a province) chairpersons elect amongst themselves the president of the National League of the Barangays ([[Liga ng mga Barangay]]).\n\nDuring the Spanish era, there was no elected or appointed national legislature representing the Philippines. The natives were allowed to elect the [[cabeza de barangay]] or the [[barangay]] (village) chief, but the electorate was almost always from the [[principalia]] or the ruling class. Originally hereditary, the position become elective by 1768. In each town, a [[gobernadorcillo]] serves as the representative of the Spanish government. It is elected by the 12 most senior cabezas, and the outgoing gobernadorcillo. The position was made elective in 1786. This system of governance persisted until the enactment of the [[Maura Law]] in 1893. The first (and only) election under this new system was in [[1895 Philippine municipal elections|January 1, 1895]].\n\nWhen the Americans defeated the Spanish in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], and the Filipinos in the [[Philippine\u2013American War]], the Americans began holding elections in pacified areas. The first such elections, which are open to all males above 21 years of age, was held in [[1899 Philippine local elections|May 7, 1899]].\n\n==Other elections==\n\n===Referendums and plebiscites===\n[[Referendum|Referendums and plebiscites]] are conducted in order to pass certain laws. Any amendments or revision to the constitution, merging, creation and abolition of local government units and autonomous regions and the like are validated via plebiscites. In order for a referendum and plebiscite to pass, the votes in favor must be greater in number than those which are opposed; there is no requirement for how high the [[voter turnout]] should be in such referendums or plebiscites.\n\nThe terms \"referendum\" and \"plebiscite\" mean different things in the context of Philippine political discourse:\n*Referendum is the power of the electorate to approve or reject a legislation through an election called for the purpose.\n*Plebiscite is the electoral process by which an initiative on the Constitution is approved or rejected by the people.\n**It is also the term used in determining the creation of a [[barangay]] (village), municipalities, cities, provinces and autonomous regions.\n\nIn order to initiate a referendum, a total of 10% of all registered voters, plus 3% from every affected legislative district, must sign a petition. If the affected locality only has one legislative district, the 3% requirement falls to every municipality for a province-wide referendum, and for every barangay for citywide referendum. For barangay-level referendums, the requirement is 10% of all registered voters. For a constitutional plebiscite, 12% of all registered voters is needed, with 3% for all legislative districts, and that it could be exercised five years after its ratification on February 2, 1987, and once every five years after each plebiscite. A referendum is passed if it is approved by a majority of the votes cast; a defeat means the law sought to be rejected or amended remains to be in full effect.\n\nThere had been two \"waves\" of national referendums in the Philippines: the first was during the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Commonwealth period]], and the latter was during the [[History of the Philippines (1965-1986)|martial law period]]. Locally, the most common plebiscites are on creating new provinces and the upgrading of a municipality into a city.\n\nThe last provincial-level plebiscite was on 2019 for the for the [[Compostela Valley renaming plebiscite|renaming of Compostela Valley to \"Davao del Oro\"]] that was passed; the last national plebiscite was in 1987 for the [[1987 Philippine constitutional plebiscite|approval of the constitution]] endorsed by the 1986 Constitutional Commission.\n\n===Recall elections===\nElected local government officials may be [[Recall election|recalled]]. A recall election may be called if there is a petition of at least 25% of the registered voters in that LGU. An amendment to the law where a majority of all members of a preparatory recall assembly, composed of all elected local officials within a local government unit (LGU), endorse a recall, was repealed. The recalled official is not allowed to resign when facing a recall election, but may participate in it; the candidate with the highest number of votes wins the recall election.\n\nThe president, vice president, members of Congress cannot be removed via recall. The president and vice president can be removed by [[impeachment]], while members of Congress can be removed via expulsion within their ranks.\n\nThe last recall election above the [[barangay]] level was the [[2015 Puerto Princesa mayoral recall election]].\n\n===Initiatives===\n{{main|People's Initiative}}\n[[Initiative]]s (locally known as \"people's initiative\") to amend or revise the constitution or propose new laws are allowed if there is a petition of at least 12% of all registered voters in the country, with at least 3% in every [[legislative districts of the Philippines|legislative district]]. A plebiscite will be called it meets such requirements. A people's initiative has never made it past the stage verification of signatures.\n\n===Special elections===\n{{main|List of special elections to the Philippine Congress}}\nThe term \"special election\" in the Philippines may mean either of the following:\n*An election that was supposedly held with the general election but was delayed;\n*An election to elect a new official after the predecessor left office (known as \"[[by-election]]s\" elsewhere)\nMembers of the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] and of unaffiliated members of the upcoming [[Bangsamoro Parliament]] can be elected under the second type of special election whenever the predecessor leaves office, except when the next regularly scheduled election is less than a year away. A special election for president and vice president can only be called if both offices are vacant at the same time, and is outside the 18 months prior to the next regularly scheduled presidential election. Replacement of vacancies in legislatures governed by the Local Government Code is done via appointment, and not by special elections.\n\nThe last special election to elect a vacancy to the House of Representatives was [[2012 Negros Occidental's 5th legislative district special election|2012 for Negros Occidental's 5th legislative district]]. The last special election for the presidency was on [[1986 Philippine presidential election|1986]].\n\n===Primary elections===\n[[Primary election]]s do not currently exist in the Philippines. The leaders of the various political parties select the candidates themselves, and party membership is liquid. In some cases, if a politician is not chosen to be a candidate, he can join another party (such as [[Ferdinand Marcos]], a Liberal, jumped ship to the Nacionalistas in 1965 when the Liberals picked incumbent [[Diosdado Macapagal]] as their presidential candidate), or create their own party (such as [[Fidel Ramos]], when he created Lakas ng Tao (now [[Lakas Kampi CMD]]) after the [[Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino]] chose [[Ramon Mitra]] as their presidential candidate in 1992).\n\nPrimary elections did exist in the Third Republic era in the Liberal and Nacionalista parties.\n\n===Constitutional Conventions===\n{{main|Constitutional Convention (Philippines)}}\nCalling a [[Constitutional Convention (Philippines)|Constitutional Convention]] is one of the ways to amend or revise the [[constitution of the Philippines]]. While voting is expected to be via the existing [[legislative districts of the Philippines|legislative districts]], Congress decides on how many delegates would be elected, thus how many delegates would be distributed per district. The election is nonpartisan.\n\nDuring the 1970 Constitutional Convention election, each district had 2 to 16 delegates, elected via [[plurality-at-large voting]]. During the 1934 Constitutional Convention election, each district had 2 to 14 delegates, also elected via plurality-at-large-voting.\n\nThe body that proposed the current constitution, the [[Philippine Constitutional Commission of 1986]], was appointed by the President, [[Corazon Aquino]]. The [[Revolutionary Government of the Philippines|Malolos Congress]] was partly elected.\n\n==History==\nBeginning during the Spanish Colonial Period there were a few attempts nationally of electing local officials.  Once the Spanish colonial government was replaced by the American colonial [[Insular Government]]. following the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], and the [[First Philippine Republic]] defeated in the [[Philippine\u2013American War]], there were multiple elections held throughout peaceful areas of the country for provincial and local officials.\n\nDuring the [[First Philippine Republic]] an attempt was made to elect a national congress but the Republic did not control the Philippines and so no nationwide election could be held.  The first fully national election for a fully elected legislative body was in 1907 for the [[Philippine Assembly]], the elected half of the [[bicameral]] [[Philippine Legislature]] during the American Colonial Period.\n\n===List of elections===\nOnly elections national in scope are included.\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n!Year !!

The [[President of the Philippines|president]], [[Vice President of the Philippines|vice-president]], and the [[List of members of the 15th Congress of the Philippines#Senate|senators]] are elected for a six-year term, while the [[List of members of the 15th Congress of the Philippines#House of Representatives|members of the House of Representatives]], [[List of Governors in the Philippines|governors]], vice-governors, [[Sangguniang Panlalawigan|members of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan]] (provincial board members), [[mayor]]s, [[Deputy mayor|vice-mayors]], [[Sangguniang Panlungsod|members of the Sangguniang Panlungsod]]/[[Sangguniang Bayan|members of the Sangguniang Bayan]] (city/municipal councilors), [[barangay]] officials, and the [[Sangguniang Kabataan|members of the Sangguniang Kabataan]] (youth councilors) are elected to serve for a three-year term.\n\nThe [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] or ''Kongreso'' has [[Bicameralism|two chambers]]. The [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] or ''Kapulungan ng mga Kinatawan'' has 292 seats {{as of|2013|lc=yes}}, of which 80% are contested in single seat [[electoral district]]s and 20% are allotted to party-lists according to a modified [[Hare quota]] with remainders disregarded and a three-seat cap. These party list seats are only accessible to marginalized and under-represented groups and parties, local parties, and sectoral wings of major parties that represent the marginalized. The [[Constitution of the Philippines]] allows the House of Representatives to have more than 250 members by statute without a need for a [[constitutional amendment]]. The Senate or ''Senado'' has 24 members who are elected on a nationwide [[at-large]] basis; they do not represent any geographical district. Half of the Senate is renewed every three years.\n\nThe Philippines has a [[Multi-party system|multi-party]] system, with numerous [[Political party|parties]] in which no one party normally has a chance of gaining power alone, and parties must work with each other to form a [[coalition government]]. The [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] (COMELEC) is responsible for running the elections.\n\nUnder the Constitution, elections for the members of Congress and local positions (except barangay officials) occur every second [[Monday|Monday]] of [[May|May]] every third year after May [[1992|1992]], and presidential and vice presidential elections occur every second Monday of May every sixth year after May 1992. All elected officials, except those at the barangay level, start (and end) their terms of office on [[June|June]] 30 of the election year.\n\n==Voting==\n\n===Qualification===\nEvery citizen 18 years old or above on Election Day who has been a resident of the [[Philippines|Philippines]] for at least a year and for at least six months in the place where she or he is registered, and who is not otherwise disqualified by law, may vote. In order to actually vote, a citizen has to [[Voter registration in the Philippines|register]]. The COMELEC has a registration period of several months prior to the election. Those who are not registered do not appear on the voters' list and are ineligible to vote despite being otherwise qualified to do so.\n\nPeople aged 15 to 18 may vote in [[Sangguniang Kabataan]] elections. As with their adult counterparts, the COMELEC has a registration period a few months prior to the election.\n\n===Absentee voters===\n[[Absentee ballot|Absentee voters]] are divided into two types: the local absentee voters and the overseas absentee voters. Local absentee voters include people who are working during Election Day. These include soldiers, policemen, government employees and the like. Overseas absentee voters are [[Overseas Filipinos|Filipinos residing abroad]]. They are eligible to vote on national positions only (president, vice-president, senators and party-list representatives). Overseas absentee voters may vote in Philippine embassies and consulates, and voting begins as early as 4 months prior to the election. The voting can be as long as 6 months in a very few situations.\n\n===Process===\n[[File:Ballot boxes.jpg|thumb|[[Ballot boxes]] used for the [[2007 Philippine barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan elections|2007 Philippine Barangay Elections]] in [[Davao City|Davao]].]]\n{{main|Electoral process in the Philippines}}\nOnce a registered voter finds his/her name in the voters' list and locates the correct precinct, he may queue in line for the distribution of the ballot.\n\nPrior to the [[2010 Philippine general election|2010 elections]], voters have to write the names of the candidates next to the positions in which they are running. COMELEC-approved nicknames maybe used by the voters in writing the names. After the polling period ends, the Board of Election Inspectors (or the teachers manning the polling precinct) counts the ballots by hand. Once all the ballots are counted, the election returns will now be sent to the city or municipal Board of Canvassers, political parties and other groups.\n\nThe city or municipal Board of Canvassers canvasses the votes from all polling precincts within their jurisdiction and prepares two documents: a Statement of Votes (SOV) in which all votes from all candidates in all positions per precinct is listed; and a Certificate of Canvass (COC), a document showing the vote totals of all candidates within the Board of Canvassers' jurisdiction.\n\nIf the city or municipal Board of Canvassers' jurisdiction is an independent city with its own congressional district, they will send their SOV and COC to the national Board of Canvassers (the COMELEC for senate and party-list elections, [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] for presidential and vice presidential elections). If it is otherwise, they will send their SOV and COC to the provincial Board of Canvassers where the votes as stated from the city or municipal COC will be canvassed. The provincial Board of Canvassers sends their SOV and COC to the national Board of Canvassers once canvassing is done. The national Board of Canvassers then canvasses all COCs and declares the winners for national positions.\n\n===Election automation===\n{{main|Vote counting in the Philippines}}\nSince the 2010 elections, the voters have to shade the oval that was indicated before the candidate's name, and a [[voting machine]] manufactured by [[Smartmatic]] automatically counts each ballot as it is fed into it. The results are then printed as the election return and sent electronically to the city or municipal Board of Canvassers.\n\nIn 2016, for the third time in a row, the Philippines automated their elections using electronic vote counting machines. The deployment of 92,500 of these machines was the largest in the world. [[Brazil]] and [[India]], countries which also use technology to process their votes, employ e-voting instead of an automated count.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Inquirer|first1=News|title=\nSmartmatic: PH now world reference point for automated elections|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/785083/smartmatic-ph-now-world-reference-point-for-automated-elections|accessdate=10 May 2016|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=2016-05-10}}</ref>\n\nFor the 2019 elections, the COMELEC presented its source code for review by accredited U.S. software testing company Pro V&V in an effort to make the automated elections transparent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/12/06/18/2019-polls-source-code-passes-foreign-firm-review-comelec-spokesman|title=2019 polls source code passes foreign firm review: Comelec spokesman|last=News|first=Christian V.

The presidential and vice presidential elections are held every six years. Election Days in which the president and vice president and [[barangay]] officials are not elected are called \"[[midterm election]]s\"; Election Days in which the president and vice president are elected are called \"presidential elections\". Barangay-level officials, although are currently elected in the same year as the other officials, are elected separately the succeeding months (see below).\n\nFrom 1949 to 1971, election days are held every second Tuesday of November of every odd-numbered year with the presidential and vice presidential election held the every fourth year starting from 1951.\n\nBarangay-level elections, starting from 2007, are to be held every three years during the last Monday of October, although these elections are frequently postponed (and incumbents' terms are extended) as a cost-saving measure. Elections for the positions in the [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]] (ARMM), starting from 2011, are to be held every three years during the second Monday of May.\n\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!Position !! 2016 !! 2017 !! 2018 !! 2019 !! 2020 !! 2021 !! 2022\n|-\n!Type\n| Presidential (May)|| None || Barangay (May) || Midterm (May) ||colspan=2|None || Presidential (May) Barangay (December)\n|-\n!President and<br />vice president\n|'''President and vice president''' ||colspan=5|None ||'''President and vice president'''\n|-\n!Senate\n|'''Seats contested during even-numbered years (12 seats)''' ||colspan=2|None ||'''Seats contested during odd-numbered years (12 seats)''' ||colspan=2|None ||'''Seats contested during even-numbered years (12 seats)'''\n|-\n!House of Representatives\n|'''All seats''' ||colspan=2|None ||'''All seats''' ||colspan=2|None ||'''All seats'''\n|-\n!ARMM\n|'''All positions'''||colspan=2|None ||'''All positions''' ||colspan=2|None ||'''All positions'''\n|-\n!Provinces, cities and municipalities\n|'''All positions''' ||colspan=2|None ||'''All positions''' ||colspan=2|None ||'''All positions'''\n|-\n!Barangays\n|colspan=2|None ||'''All positions''' || None ||'''All positions'''||colspan=2|None\n|}\n\n===Inauguration===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!Position !! 2016 !! 2017 !! 2018 !! 2019 !! 2020 !! 2021 !! 2022\n|-\n!Type\n| Presidential (June)|| None || Barangay (June) || Midterm (June) ||colspan=2|None || Presidential (June)\n|-\n!President and<br />vice president\n|'''June 30''' ||colspan=5|None ||'''June 30'''\n|-\n!Senate\n|'''June 30''' ||colspan=2|None ||'''June 30''' ||colspan=2|None ||'''June 30'''\n|-\n!House\n|'''June 30''' ||colspan=2|None ||'''June 30''' ||colspan=2|None ||'''June 30'''\n|-\n!BARMM\n|'''June 30''' ||colspan=2|None ||'''June 30''' ||colspan=2|None ||'''June 30'''\n|-\n!Provinces, cities and municipalities\n|'''June 30''' ||colspan=2|None ||'''June 30''' ||colspan=2|None ||'''June 30'''\n|-\n!Barangays\n|colspan=2|None ||'''June 30''' ||None ||colspan=2|None ||'''TBA''' \n|}\n\n<!--\nVarious acts are allowed and disallowed during the election and campaigning period.

The candidate with the [[First-past-the-post|most votes wins]] the position; there is no [[run-off election]], and the president and vice president may come from different parties. If two or more candidates emerge with an equal and highest number of votes, one of them will be elected by the Senate and the House of Representatives, voting separately.\n\nThe first presidential and vice presidential election in the Philippines was the [[Tejeros Convention]] of 1897; this was for the leadership of the Katipunan, where Aguinaldo was elected as leader. The first presidential election in which the presidency of the Philippines was at stake was in January 1, 1899, when the Malolos Congress of the [[First Philippine Republic]] elected Aguinaldo as president.\n\nThe first presidential election via a [[direct election]] was in [[1935 Philippine presidential election|September 16, 1935]] where Aguinaldo was defeated by [[Manuel L. Quezon]]. The first presidential election in the current constitution was in [[1992 Philippine presidential election|June 30, 1992]] where [[Fidel Ramos]] defeated six other candidates.\n\n===Congress===\n\n====Senators====\n{{main|Philippine senatorial elections}}\nThe Senate has 24 members, and 12 members are elected every election; hence, each voter is entitled to twelve votes for the [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] in every election. The voter may not complete the twelve votes for the Senate, but s/he must not surpass the twelve votes or else his/her ballot for that position will be [[null vote|nullified]]. With the entire country as one [[at-large]] district, the [[Plurality-at-large voting|twelve candidates with the most votes]] are elected. This is often not [[proportional representation|proportional]] to the results.\n\nFrom 1951 to 1971, instead of 12 senators elected every three years, the electorate voted for eight senators every two years in the same format. From 1941 to 1949, all elections to the senate were by block voting: the voters may write a name for every seat contested, or they can write the name of the party, which would then give [[general ticket|all of the voters' votes]] to that party's ticket. Compounded with the [[Nacionalista Party]]'s dominance, this caused a sweep of 24 seats for them in [[1941 Philippine Senate election|1941]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/columns/view/20061120-33603/Block_voting |title=Block voting |first=Manuel III |last=Quezon |authorlink=Manuel Quezon III |publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=2006-11-20 |accessdate=2010-12-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326173220/http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/columns/view/20061120-33603/Block_voting |archive-date=March 26, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> From 1916 to 1934, voting was via [[Senatorial districts of the Philippines|senatorial districts]]; voters vote for one candidate every three years, except for the first election in 1916 where they'd vote for two candidates; the second-placed candidate would only serve for three years.\n\n====House of Representatives====\nEach voter has two votes in the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]].\n\nA voter may [[single member constituency|elect a representative]] from the [[Legislative districts of the Philippines|congressional district]] of residence. The candidate with the highest number of votes in a district wins that district's seat.\n\nA voter may also elect a party-list organization. The voter [[closed list|votes for the party, not for the candidate]], and the voter is restricted to one vote. All votes are tallied in an [[at-large]] basis, and parties with at least 2% of the vote wins at least one seat in the House. A further two more seats will be granted if there are still spare seats (the party-list representatives comprise 20% of the House), and if there are still unfilled seats, the parties with less than 2% of the vote will get one seat each in descending order until all seats are filled. A party-list organization is limited to representing marginalized sectors of society such as youth, laborers, women, and the like.\n\nPreviously, the calculation for the winners in the party-list election was different: the winning parties should have 2% of the national vote and are awarded one seat; any additional 2% is given an additional seat until the maximum of three seats per party is filled up. Since only a few parties surpassed the 2% [[election threshold]], the number of party-list representatives was always less than 20% of the House's membership.\n\nThe party-list system was first used in 1998; from 1987 to 1995, the president with the concurrence of the [[Commission on Appointments (Philippines)|Commission on Appointments]], appointed the sectoral representatives. Sectoral representatives were first elected during [[1978 Philippine parliamentary sectoral election|1978]].\n\nThe first legislative election was the for the Malolos Congress in [[1898 Philippine Malolos Congress elections|June 23\u2013September 10, 1898]]. The first election for an entirely elected body was in [[1907 Philippine Assembly elections|July 30, 1907]]. This was also the first general election in the Philippines.\n\n===Local positions===\n{{main|Local government in the Philippines}}\nSynchronized with the national elections are the local elections. The voter may vote for any of the following:\n*Provincial-level:\n**One governor\n**One vice governor\n**One to seven [[Sangguniang Panlalawigan]] members (provincial board)\n*City- or municipal-level:\n**One mayor\n**One vice mayor\n**Four to twelve [[Sangguniang Panlungsod]]/[[Sangguniang Bayan]] members (city or municipal council, respectively)\nIf the city the voter is residing in a [[Cities of the Philippines#Classification|highly urbanized city or independent component city]], the voter can not vote for any of the provincial-level positions.\n\nThe [[Sangguniang Panlalawigan]] (provincial board), [[Sangguniang Panlungsod]] (city council) and [[Sangguniang Bayan]] (municipal council)'s manner of election is identical with that of the Senate. In some cities and provinces, they are split into districts (not necessarily the same as the congressional district) in which separate board members/council members are elected.\n\n[[Barangay elections]] are held every three years, although usually not in the same time as elections for other positions. Terms of incumbent barangay officials are often extended when Congress suspend the barangay elections as a cost-saving measure. The barangay-level positions are:\n*One [[Punong Barangay|punong barangay]] (barangay captain)\n*Seven [[Barangay Kagawad|barangay kagawads]] (councilors)\n*One [[Sangguniang Kabataan]] (SK) chairperson (youth council chairperson)\n*Seven SK kagawads (councilors)\n\nThe manner of election of the Sangguniang Kabataan in the barangay is identical to the one used in the Senate. Each barangay is entitled to one SK. The barangay SK chairpersons in a city or municipality elect amongst themselves a president that will sit as an ''[[ex officio]]'' member of the city or municipal council. The city (if applicable) and municipal SK presidents then elect amongst themselves a president that will sit in the provincial board as an ''ex officio'' member. Finally, provincial and city (which are not under the jurisdiction of a province) chairpersons elect amongst themselves the SK national federation president that will sit as an ''ex officio'' member of the [[National Youth Commission (Philippines)|National Youth Commission]].\n\nThe manner of representation of the different barangay chairmen in the municipal, city and provincial legislatures as ''ex officio'' members is identical with the way how the SK chairpersons are represented; the provincial and city (which are not under the jurisdiction of a province) chairpersons elect amongst themselves the president of the National League of the Barangays ([[Liga ng mga Barangay]]).\n\nDuring the Spanish era, there was no elected or appointed national legislature representing the Philippines. The natives were allowed to elect the [[cabeza de barangay]] or the [[barangay]] (village) chief, but the electorate was almost always from the [[principalia]] or the ruling class. Originally hereditary, the position become elective by 1768. In each town, a [[gobernadorcillo]] serves as the representative of the Spanish government. It is elected by the 12 most senior cabezas, and the outgoing gobernadorcillo. The position was made elective in 1786. This system of governance persisted until the enactment of the [[Maura Law]] in 1893. The first (and only) election under this new system was in [[1895 Philippine municipal elections|January 1, 1895]].\n\nWhen the Americans defeated the Spanish in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], and the Filipinos in the [[Philippine\u2013American War]], the Americans began holding elections in pacified areas. The first such elections, which are open to all males above 21 years of age, was held in [[1899 Philippine local elections|May 7, 1899]].\n\n==Other elections==\n\n===Referendums and plebiscites===\n[[Referendum|Referendums and plebiscites]] are conducted in order to pass certain laws. Any amendments or revision to the constitution, merging, creation and abolition of local government units and autonomous regions and the like are validated via plebiscites. In order for a referendum and plebiscite to pass, the votes in favor must be greater in number than those which are opposed; there is no requirement for how high the [[voter turnout]] should be in such referendums or plebiscites.\n\nThe terms \"referendum\" and \"plebiscite\" mean different things in the context of Philippine political discourse:\n*Referendum is the power of the electorate to approve or reject a legislation through an election called for the purpose.\n*Plebiscite is the electoral process by which an initiative on the Constitution is approved or rejected by the people.\n**It is also the term used in determining the creation of a [[barangay]] (village), municipalities, cities, provinces and autonomous regions.\n\nIn order to initiate a referendum, a total of 10% of all registered voters, plus 3% from every affected legislative district, must sign a petition. If the affected locality only has one legislative district, the 3% requirement falls to every municipality for a province-wide referendum, and for every barangay for citywide referendum. For barangay-level referendums, the requirement is 10% of all registered voters. For a constitutional plebiscite, 12% of all registered voters is needed, with 3% for all legislative districts, and that it could be exercised five years after its ratification on February 2, 1987, and once every five years after each plebiscite. A referendum is passed if it is approved by a majority of the votes cast; a defeat means the law sought to be rejected or amended remains to be in full effect.\n\nThere had been two \"waves\" of national referendums in the Philippines: the first was during the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Commonwealth period]], and the latter was during the [[History of the Philippines (1965-1986)|martial law period]]. Locally, the most common plebiscites are on creating new provinces and the upgrading of a municipality into a city.\n\nThe last provincial-level plebiscite was on 2013 for the [[2013 Davao Occidental creation plebiscite|creation of a new province of Davao Occidental]] that was passed; the last national plebiscite was in 1987 for the [[1987 Philippine constitutional plebiscite|approval of the constitution]] endorsed by the 1986 Constitutional Commission.\n\n===Recall===\nElected local government officials may be [[Recall election|recalled]]. A recall election may be called if there is a petition of at least 25% of the registered voters in that LGU. An amendment to the law where a majority of all members of a preparatory recall assembly, composed of all elected local officials within a local government unit (LGU), endorse a recall, was repealed. The recalled official is not allowed to resign when facing a recall election, but may participate in it; the candidate with the highest number of votes wins the recall election.\n\nThe president, vice president, members of Congress cannot be removed via recall. The president and vice president can be removed by [[impeachment]], while members of Congress can be removed via expulsion within their ranks.\n\nThe last recall election above the [[barangay]] level was the [[2015 Puerto Princesa mayoral recall election]].\n\n===Initiatives===\n{{main|People's Initiative}}\n[[Initiative]]s (locally known as \"people's initiative\") to amend or revise the constitution or propose new laws are allowed if there is a petition of at least 12% of all registered voters in the country, with at least 3% in every [[legislative districts of the Philippines|legislative district]]. A plebiscite will be called it meets such requirements. A people's initiative has never made it past the stage verification of signatures.\n\n===Special election===\n{{main|List of special elections to the Philippine Congress}}\nThe term \"special election\" in the Philippines may mean either of the following:\n*An election that was supposedly held with the general election but was delayed;\n*An election to elect a new official after the predecessor left office (known as \"[[by-election]]s\" elsewhere)\nMembers of the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] and of the [[ARMM Regional Legislative Assembly]] can be elected under the second type of special election whenever the predecessor leaves office, except when the next regularly scheduled election is less than a year away. A special election for president and vice president can only be called if both offices are vacant at the same time, and is outside the 18 months prior to the next regularly scheduled presidential election.\n\nThe last special election to elect a vacancy to the House of Representatives was [[2012 Negros Occidental's 5th legislative district special election|2012 for Negros Occidental's 5th legislative district]]. The last special election for the presidency was on [[1986 Philippine presidential election|1986]].\n\n===Primary elections===\n[[Primary election]]s do not exist in the Philippines. The leaders of the various political parties select the candidates themselves, and party membership is liquid. In some cases, if a politician is not chosen to be a candidate, he can join another party (such as [[Ferdinand Marcos]], a Liberal, jumped ship to the Nacionalistas in 1965 when the Liberals picked incumbent [[Diosdado Macapagal]] as their presidential candidate), or create their own party (such as [[Fidel Ramos]], when he created Lakas ng Tao (now [[Lakas Kampi CMD]]) after the [[Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino]] chose [[Ramon Mitra]] as their presidential candidate in 1992).\n\n===Constitutional Conventions===\n{{main|Constitutional Convention (Philippines)}}\nCalling a [[Constitutional Convention (Philippines)|Constitutional Convention]] is one of the ways to amend or revise the [[constitution of the Philippines]]. While voting is expected to be via the existing [[legislative districts of the Philippines|legislative districts]], Congress decides on how many delegates would be elected, thus how many delegates would be distributed per district. The election is nonpartisan.\n\nDuring the 1970 Constitutional Convention election, each district had 2 to 16 delegates, elected via [[plurality-at-large voting]]. During the 1934 Constitutional Convention election, each district had 2 to 14 delegates, also elected via plurality-at-large-voting.\n\nThe body that proposed the current constitution, the [[Philippine Constitutional Commission of 1986]], was appointed by the President, [[Corazon Aquino]]. The [[Revolutionary Government of the Philippines|Malolos Congress]] was partly elected.\n\n==History==\nBeginning during the Spanish Colonial Period there were a few attempts nationally of electing local officials.  Once the Spanish colonial government was replaced by the American colonial [[Insular Government]]. following the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], and the [[First Philippine Republic]] defeated in the [[Philippine\u2013American War]], there were multiple elections held throughout peaceful areas of the country for provincial and local officials.\n\nDuring the [[First Philippine Republic]] an attempt was made to elect a national congress but the Republic did not control the Philippines and so no nationwide election could be held.  The first fully national election for a fully elected legislative body was in 1907 for the [[Philippine Assembly]], the elected half of the [[bicameral]] [[Philippine Legislature]] during the American Colonial Period.\n\n===List of elections===\nOnly elections national in scope are included.\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n!Year !!

Construction of the station began around 1929, and it was opened to service on April 9, 1936. Several of the station's entrances were closed in the late 20th century due to crime. In the 2010s and 2020s, the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (MTA) announced plans to make the station [[ADA-accessible]] and to reopen closed exits.\n\nNostrand Avenue has four tracks and four [[Side platform|side platforms]], with two platform levels. Express trains stop on the upper level while local trains stop on the lower level. This is because, in the original design for the station, the Nostrand Avenue station was slated to be a local station with only two platforms, and the current upper level was intended to be a mezzanine.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe Nostrand Avenue station was constructed as part of the IND Fulton Street Line, the main line of the city-owned [[Independent Subway System]] (IND)'s main line from [[Downtown Brooklyn]] to southern [[Queens]].<ref name=\"NYTimes-OurGreatSubway-IND2ndSystem-19292\">{{cite news|last1=Duffus|first1=R.L.|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1929/09/22/91938390.pdf|title=Our Great Subway Network Spreads Wider; New Plans of Board of Transportation Involve the Building of More Than One Hundred Miles of Additional Rapid Transit Routes for New York|date=September 22, 1929|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=August 19, 2015}}</ref> The groundbreaking for the line was held on April 16, 1929, at Fulton Street and Arlington Place, located at the site of the future station.<ref name=\"BklynEagle-INDFultonGbk-Ap1929\">{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/59879473/?terms=%22Crosstown%22%2B%22subway%22%2B%22schermerhorn%22|title=New Fulton Street Subway Officially Started as Byrne Turns Earth; Ground is Broken For Subway Line Along Fulton St.; Byrne Turns First Spade of Arlington Pl.

The report concluded that if additional capital funding was provided, or if the [[Federal Transit Administration]]'s interpretation of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] (ADA) reverted its original flexible approach, reopening the closed entrances at Nostrand Avenue would become more feasible.<ref name=\"MTA-ReviewAC-2015\" />{{rp|37\u201338}} The report stated that reopening the Bedford Avenue entrances would reduce congestion at the Nostrand Avenue entrance, would reduce uneven loading on A and C trains, and would cut the walking distance for riders going to and from areas west of Arlington Place, including bus riders. It also found that reopening the closed entrances at Fulton Street and Arlington Place to the northbound platform would provide similar benefits at a lower cost.<ref name=\"MTA-ReviewAC-2015\" />{{rp|73}}\n\nDespite overcrowding at the Nostrand Avenue station, the Bedford Avenue entrances remained for over 25 years.<ref name=\"Meyer 2020\"/><ref name=\":0\"/><ref name=\"Guse 2020\" /> In 2019, the MTA announced that this station would become ADA-accessible as part of the agency's 2020\u20132024 Capital Program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mta.info/press-release/mta-headquarters/mta-announces-20-additional-subway-stations-receive-accessibility|title=MTA Announces 20 Additional Subway Stations to Receive Accessibility Improvements Under Proposed 2020-2024 Capital Plan|date=December 19, 2019|website=mta.info|publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority|access-date=December 25, 2019}}</ref> On February 6, 2020, the MTA held a press conference in the closed Bedford Avenue mezzanine of the station and announced that the Bedford Avenue entrances to the station would be reopened by the end of the year.
