She is most notable for her [[glamour photography|glamour]] and [[cosplay]] [[Instagram model|modeling]] on [[Instagram]]. Her posts on the platform featured a risqu\u00e9 and self-proclaimed \"weird\" aesthetic, and were often influenced by popular [[Internet memes]] and trends. As a result of her online activity, she became an Internet meme in her own right.\n\nIn the summer of 2019, Kirschner registered a joke [[Pornhub]] account and began selling her \"GamerGirl Bath Water\" product through her online store, garnering her a great amount of media coverage online. Shortly after, her Instagram account was deleted due to community guideline violations. Media outlets have described Kirschner as a cross between an [[Internet troll]] and a performance artist, as well as an [[e-girls and e-boys|e-girl]]. Kirschner has also been cited as an influence on the e-girl aesthetic commonly adopted by [[TikTok]] users.\n\n==Life and career==\n===Early years and developing an aesthetic===\nKirschner was born on 23 October 1999 in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], and eventually moved to the [[United Kingdom]].<ref name=Sloan2019>{{cite web|last=Sloan|first=Elizabeth|url=https://heavy.com/entertainment/2019/07/belle-delphine/|title=Belle Delphine: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know|work=[[Heavy.com|Heavy]]|date=19 July 2019|accessdate=20 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190720020343/https://heavy.com/entertainment/2019/07/belle-delphine/|archive-date=20 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=PopBuzz2019>{{cite web|url=https://www.popbuzz.com/internet/youtubers/belle-delphine/real-name/|title=Belle Delphine: 12 Facts You (Probably) Didn't Know About The Online Star|work=[[Global (company)#Digital-only stations|PopBuzz]]|publisher=[[Global (company)|Global]]|date=2019|accessdate=31 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190831210349/https://www.popbuzz.com/internet/youtubers/belle-delphine/real-name/|archive-date=31 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=Aggeler2019>{{cite web|last=Aggeler|first=Madeleine|url=https://www.thecut.com/2019/07/belle-delphine-bath-water.html|title=Who Is Belle Delphine, the Gamer Girl Selling Her Bathwater?|work=[[The Cut (blog)|The Cut]]|publisher=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=19 July 2019|accessdate=20 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190713005639/https://www.thecut.com/2019/07/belle-delphine-bath-water.html|archive-date=13 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Kirschner has had an Instagram account since 2015,<ref name=Leskin2019-a>{{cite web|last=Leskin|first=Paige|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/belle-delphine-instagram-bathwater-pornhub-2019-7|title=Meet Belle Delphine, the Instagram star who sold her bathwater to 'thirsty gamer boys' and had her account shut down over a rules violation|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=10 September 2019|accessdate=7 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191008235928/https://www.businessinsider.com/belle-delphine-instagram-bathwater-pornhub-2019-7/|archive-date=8 October 2019|url-status=live}}\n*{{cite web|last=Leskin|first=Paige|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190720150013/https://www.businessinsider.com/belle-delphine-instagram-bathwater-pornhub-2019-7|title=Meet Belle Delphine, the Instagram star who sold her bathwater to 'thirsty gamer boys' and had her account shut down over a rules violation [19 July 2019 archive]|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=19 July 2019|accessdate=7 October 2019|archive-date=19 July 2019}}</ref> and in July 2016, she registered a [[YouTube]] account.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXvKUavCtDOlA8bT1i2tI3w/about|title=belle delphine \u2013 YouTube about page|work=belle delphine|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=28 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190729035941/https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXvKUavCtDOlA8bT1i2tI3w/about|archive-date=29 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> In August 2016, Kirschner uploaded a [[Beauty YouTuber|makeup tutorial video]], demonstrating how to do a [[eye shadow|cat-eye]].<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r0Xe7ESrBE|title=My everyday makeup! {{pipe}} Belle|work=belle delphine|publisher=YouTube|date=14 August 2016|accessdate=28 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190710011428/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r0Xe7ESrBE|archive-date=10 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=Dickson2019>{{cite web|last=Dickson|first=EJ|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/belle-delphine-bathwater-gamer-girl-troll-857192/|title=Is Belle Delphine, a.k.a.

Her posts on the platform featured a risqu\u00e9 and self-proclaimed \"weird\" aesthetic, and were often influenced by popular [[Internet memes]] and trends.

{"title_page": "US-1 Trucks", "text_new": "[[File:US1Introduction1981.jpg|thumb|1981 Tyco Catalog Introduction to US-1 Electric Trucking]]\n\n'''US-1 Electric Trucking''', produced by [[Tyco Toys]] from 1981 to 1986, is a line of [[HO scale]] slot car sets focused around trucks. It was similar to previous Tyco HO Scale racing sets; however the vehicles could be run in reverse due to having guide pins at the front and rear of the chassis. The line was unique because most of the vehicles were able to pick up and deliver loads from various \u2018Action Accessories\u2019 without intervention from the operator.\n\nOne of those involved in the development of US-1 was Derek A. Brand (1926 to 2012) who had designed the first HO slot system - [[mettoy|Playcraft]] Electric Highways, which was launched in 1959. He also laid down the geometric principles of HO slot car track systems that Tyco and many other manufacturers followed for many years. (The 9\" roadway straight was derived from Atlas HO model railroad 'Snap Track', to enable his model highways use with model railroad layouts).\n\nWhile only lasting six years, a number of sets were made, with one being based on the [[G.I. Joe]] franchise. Many trucks, trailers, and other vehicles were produced, such as dump trucks, a car hauler and a fire truck. It was marketed under the tagline of \"You Control The Action!\"\n\n== How it works ==\n[[File:Custom Track Layout.jpg|left|thumb|Basic, Custom Track Layout]]\n'''Electrical''': The system was originally designed to be operated from a 6v dc supply, this later increased to 9v dc. [[Transformer]]s were supplied with the sets, but the vehicles can be safely worked from most modern conventional model railroad transformer/controllers, if the original US-1 control gear is not used.\n\n'''Track''': The trucks run on a gray variant of the Tyco Quick Clik track that provides power to the vehicles through two thin metal strips in the track, which is similar to many other HO scale road and racing systems. The track was initially produced with yellow centre lines and some other markings, although this is less common and most track was supplied unmarked.\n\nTwo types of trailing turnouts were made that allowed the vehicles to pass through unimpeded and then, if required, reverse back into a siding to access an Action Accessory. These junctions consisted of a sprung copper tongue that extended across the slot, interacting with the front and rear guide pins. A switchable '''Hi Adventure''' junction was supplied in the GI Joe set, which would allow vehicles to travel in either direction without being automatically directed into a siding. Various combinations of track sections were supplied in the sets, except the 45 degree 12\" radius curves, which were only sold separately and are hard to find. Other rare track pieces include the 9\" double turnout that only appeared in two sets and the Railroad [[grade crossing]].\n\n'''Chassis''': Longitudinal copper pick-up shoes span almost the entire length of the chassis, which transfer the power to the [[Electric motor|motor]]. The pick-ups were held in by screws and could be replaced, although some later vehicles are known to have rivets instead of screws. The motor itself is a universal clip-in type that uses a worm screw to turn a [[worm wheel]] on the rear axle. These worms and gears were originally brown, but on most vehicles they are white.\n\nAt the front and back of the chassis, guide pins keep the truck on the track, allowing it to go in reverse. Guide pins were originally brown plastic blades mounted on a wedge-shaped base, but later and most commonly, round metal pins were used. On most chassis there are two raised angled strips molded on either side of the guide pin mount, which stopped the original plastic guide blades rotating. Comparatively few chassis are without these. The actual pin mounting never changed and either type of pin can be fitted to any vehicle.\n\nThe rear axle has removable [[Synthetic rubber|rubber]] [[tires]], that will get hard over time and consequently lose grip. These occasionally require replacing. However the front axle, the extra axle on the three six-wheeled vehicles, all the axles on the trailers (and even those on the dummy Firebird) had hard plastic tires which run freely and with hardly any drag. Only the higher Stomper chassis had rubber tires front and rear.\n\nEach vehicle carries two weights - a flat plate at the front and a block at the rear with a tunnel to clear the worm gear. The rear weights vary in size to suit the vehicle. On the [[Semi-trailer truck]] (or [[Tractor unit]]) the rear weight was black and [[Casting (metalworking)|cast]] in the  form of a [[Fifth-wheel coupling]] where the trailer was attached. These give the vehicle more traction and help it to pass through the sprung junctions, which can cause lighter (non US-1) vehicles to stall.\n\n'''Working Features''': The Wrecker and the Fire Truck both carried flashing lights, the latter carried a bell, too. These were [[Mechanism (engineering)|mechanically]] activated by a geared drive taken off the rear axle. Despite those features being added, the core chassis inside these two vehicles, were the same as all the others in the range except the Stompers, which used a bespoke deeper chassis [[Injection moulding|molding]] to accommodate the lower reach required by the pick ups, which was necessary because of the higher tires.\n\nOperation of the accessories is done automatically, usually by contact with the truck or trailer. However, in the case of the crane, bulldozer, and airport, the accessory is operated by the vehicle's drive wheels acting on a roller, (as it continues to be powered in reverse, whilst pushing against a stop block).\n\n'''Controllers''': Since this was a roadway system instead of a race track, the controllers were not hand-held, but were intended to resemble the [[dashboard]] of a truck. Originally separate and attached to the track via some wires, each controller had a [[steering wheel]] (to control the speed) and a switch mounted to the side (to control the direction).\n\nThe first type of controllers are known to exist both with and without the yellow lines on the road surface. The output from the transformer was plugged directly into the terminal rail attached to the two controllers.\n\nLater these individual units were simplified so the steering wheel did both speed and direction. By this time yellow markings had stopped being applied to the road surface.\n\nThe final type of controllers came as one twin unit in the form of a single box, attached to a molded base on the side of the track and these also only had two steering wheels, which were mounted side by side. The transformer connection now plugged directly into the control box instead of the track. \n\nControllers are usually red but some of the final version were molded in green for the G.I. Joe and Stomper sets. The green ones only exist in this final twin version.\n\n== Vehicles & Trucks ==\n[[File:4 US-1 Trucks.jpg|thumb|2 Dump Trucks, a Semi Truck, & Fire Truck]]\nThe core chassis of all vehicles are of the same basic design throughout the range, (with only the Stompers using a different chassis molding) but there were many body types and different colors.\n\nThere were two makes of '''[[Semi-trailer truck|Semi-Tractor]]''' trucks modeled: One a [[Peterbilt]] conventional, the other a [[Kenworth]] C.O.E. ([[cab over engine]]). Both types had four wheels and were made to pull [[Semi-trailers]] in box, tank, flatbed, auto transporter and hopper varieties, using their exposed metal rear chassis weight which was also the Fifth Wheel Coupling.\n\nAll other vehicles except the wrecker and fire truck had plain rear chassis weights, which were hidden by the vehicle body.\n\nThere were three '''six-wheeled Peterbilt trucks''': [[dump truck]] (or tipper), troop carrier and a [[Vehicle recovery|Wrecker]]. On these, the extra axle was mounted under the body assembly.\n\n'''Other vehicles''' included a [[Mack Trucks|Mack]] [[Fire Truck]], [[police car]], [[Taxicab|taxi]], [[Pickup truck]], [[Dodge]] [[Panel van|delivery van]], [[ambulance]], [[Jeep]], and a [[Pontiac Firebird]] [[Coup\u00e9]] - The Firebird appeared in both powered (black color with gold eagle) and unpowered (white with black eagle) form, the latter for towing by the wrecker. The dummy car had a plastic chassis with a metal clip to help engage the jib of the wrecker.\n\n'''Body Colors''' were generally molded in pre-colored plastic, although the earliest known version of the Green and the Red Tipper, the Yellow/Orange and Red/White Strip Peterbilt Semi-tractors were molded in white plastic and given a painted finish. The same is true of the Mack Fire Truck, Airport Taxi, [[Goodyear Tires]] pick-up truck, Black Firebird and even the Police car, which was painted all over white before the blue panels, etc. were added. After-market re-sprays of models are becoming more common, too, they are sometimes offered for sale on Internet auction sites.\n\n'''Lights''': As well as the Wrecker and Fire Truck mentioned earlier, a number of Peterbilt trucks were made with working lights. These had a small bulb soldered to the two motor contacts. This nested in a recess within a clear plastic molding that plugged into the front grill and some openings in the cab roof. This also served as glazing in the cab windows.\n\nThe clear plastic transmitted the light from the bulb to the two rectangular headlights either side of the grille, two round lights in the bumper and an array on the cab roof. These lit up when the vehicle was travelling.\n\nThe radiator molding used on lighted trucks differed from the unlit ones as the rectangular headlights were left open, where normally they would be solid and in chrome finish like the rest of it. A similar molding to the clear one, but in dark plastic was also used in some trucks without lights, which makes them look as though they have heavily tinted windows!\n\nLighted versions of the following trucks are known: ''Peterbilt Semi-Tractors'': Yellow with Orange and Black Stripes, Red with White Stripes, Black with Gold Stripes, Yellow with Red Stripes. ''Peterbilt Tippers'' were also advertised with lights in the common Green, White with Brown and Orange Stripes and \u2018Dept of Highways\u2019 in Red and Black, however others are known such as the all over Red (Painted finish), Blue cab with the Yellow bucket and Blue cab with Silver bucket.\n\nLighted trucks were only supplied in one set 'Night Haulers',  which contained a green tipper and a red semi with white stripes. Although two lighted Kenworth trucks were sold in the racing series, there were none in the US-1 series. See '''Body Shells - Before, After & Outside of US-1''' \n\n'''Variations''': Over the years, a number of changes were made to the Peterbilt tipper mouldings. Following the release of the initial painted versions, production switched to pre-coloured plastic and a small ridge appeared lengthways in the middle of the rear of the dump bed, where the tailgate rested when shut. This ridge did not last long and was removed by the time the tail gate gained a bottom lug and matching receptor in the bucket to aid more secure closing. At the same time the originally round hinges became oval to allow the extra travel needed to open/close it.\n\nThe final change to the tipper bucket was when the tail gate changed to a fat 'T' shape, with 'stubs' added at the top on either side and the hinges were enlarged again and made thinner to accommodate these. This makes them rather fragile too. It is quite common to find these later hinges broken and the tailgate missing, whereas the earlier thicker hinges normally survive.\n\nFrom around 1983, Peterbilt Semis and Tippers both acquired an oval 'Peterbilt' logo on the sides of the hood and the front of the [[Radiator]]. The name \"Peterbilt\" can be clearly seen with a magnifier. Finally, when the tipper chassis was adapted with extra slots to take the troop-carrier body for the GI Joe set in 1984, the opening above the motor was changed from a square to a T shape.\n\nAs of April 2020, none of the plain Green Tippers or the common Semi-Tractors in either yellow and orange (with black stripes) or red (with white stripes)-(Unlighted version), have been found with the Peterbilt logos. Nor have any green Tippers been found with the troop carrier modifications to the base or with the final 'T' shaped tailgate and thinner hinges on the bucket. \n\nAs these trucks appeared in several sets that were available until the end of the range, this remains an interesting and so far unexplained anomaly. From the examples seen it would appear that the same is true for the less common red tipper, although this is thought to have only ever been included in one set. However, the red Semi-tractor with white stripes (lighted version), can be found both with and without the Peterbilt logos.\n\nAlthough the Stomper [[Blazer|Blazer]] enjoyed a very short life, variations are known: Test-shot moldings exist that include a clear plastic light bar, although no light bar has ever been found fitted on production models in this series, nor was any US-1 Blazer ever fitted with lights. The headlights on the body shell are just open round holes. Early bodies were supplied fitted with a pair of thin weights, secured sandwich-like, at the rear of the body, by two plastic prongs, melted over to hold them in place. Most examples found seem not to have these.\n\n'''Trailers''' The flat bed trailer comes in two distinct variations. The rear panel is either completely smooth or has a 6mm long ridge across the bottom. All the different color versions of the flat bed can be found both with and without this feature. \nThe ridge appears to have been added later as it also appears on a small number of hopper trailers. \n\nAll post US-1 Box trailers have this too. So far no tank trailers are known with this. See the section '''US-1 Body Shells - Before, After & Outside of US-1''' for information about the non US-1 versions of the Box trailer.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+List of Vehicles, Trucks, & Trailers\n!Trucks\n!Trailers\n!Vehicles\n|-\n|'''Peterbilt Truck Cab'''\n'''(Red with White Stripes)'''\n\n(No.3903 - 1981-1983)\n|'''Box Trailer''' \n'''(Bekins)'''\n\n(No. 3928 - 1981, 1982)\n|'''Stomper Blazer'''\n'''(White and Blue with Red Stripe)'''\n\n(No.3962 - 1985)\n|-\n|'''Peterbilt Truck Cab'''\n'''(Orange and Yellow with Black Stripes)'''\n\n(No.3904 - 1981-1982)\n|'''Gravel Trailer'''\n'''(Gravel Supply Company)'''\n\n(No. 3925 - 1981, 1982)\n|'''Stomper Blazer'''\n'''(Yellow/Gray/White with Orange Stripe)'''\n\n(No.3963 - 1985)\n|-\n|'''Peterbilt Truck Cab'''\n'''(Tan with Initials \"PB\" on Doors)'''\n\n(No.3908 - 1984-1985)\n|'''Gravel Trailer'''\n'''(Highway Construction Company)'''\n\n(No. 3926 - 1981-1984)\n|'''Stomper Pick-Up'''\n'''(Green and White with Black Stripes)'''\n\n(No.3965 - 1985)\n|-\n|'''Kenworth Truck Cab'''\n'''(Black with Yellow/Tan/Orange Stripes)'''\n\n(No.3909 - 1982-1985)\n|'''Box Trailer''' \n'''(Navajo)'''\n\n(No. 3930 - 1981, 1982)\n|'''Stomper Pick-Up'''\n'''(Yellow with Black and White Stripes)'''\n\n(No.3966 - 1985)\n|-\n|'''Kenworth Truck Cab'''\n'''(Blue with White/Yellow/Orange Stripes)'''\n\n(No.3910 - 1982)\n|'''Box Trailer'''\n'''(Pacific Intermountain Express)'''\n\n(No. 3927 - 1981, 1982)\n|'''Pick-Up Truck'''\n'''(Smith's Tire Orange and Black)'''\n\n(No.3951 - 1981-1982)\n|-\n|'''Peterbilt Truck Cab''' \n'''(Coastal Trucking Blue with Gold Stripes)'''\n\n(No.3913 - 1983-1985)\n|'''Box Trailer''' \n'''(Smith Transfer)'''\n\n(No. 3929 - 1981, 1982)\n|Dodge '''Van''' \n'''(Federal Express)'''\n\n(No.3952 - 1981-1982)\n|-\n|'''Kenworth Cab Over Truck Cab''' \n'''(Red/White/Orange)'''\n\n(No.3914 - 1983-1985)\n|'''Flatbed Trailer''' \n'''(Red Line)'''\n\n(No. 3931 - 1982)\n|Dodge Charger '''Police Car''' \n'''(Blue and White)'''\n\n(No.3953 - 1981-1984)\n|-\n|'''Lighted Peterbilt Truck Cab'''\n'''(Tan)'''\n\n(No. 3935 - 1984, 1985)\n|'''Flatbed Trailer''' \n'''(Roadway Express)'''\n\n(No. 3932 - 1982, 1983)\n|Dodge '''Ambulance'''\n(No.3954 - 1981-1984)\n|-\n|'''Lighted Peterbilt Truck Cab''' \n'''(Black with Gold Stripes)'''\n\n(No. 3939 - 1984, 1985)\n|'''Flatbed Trailer with 3 Crates''' \n'''(Roadway Express)'''\n\n(No. 3932 - 1984)\n|Dodge Charger '''Airport Taxi''' \n'''(Blue)'''\n\n(No.3955 - 1981-1982)\n|-\n|'''Peterbilt Dump Truck''' \n'''(Green)'''\n\n(No.3901 - 1981)\n|'''Tank Trailer''' \n'''(Shell)'''\n\n(No. 3940 - 1982-1984)\n|'''Pontiac Firebird''' \n'''(Black)'''\n\n(No.3956 - 1981-1984)\n|-\n|'''Peterbilt Dump Truck''' \n'''(Red)'''\n\n(No.3902 - 1981 and 1983)\n|'''Tank Trailer''' \n'''(Exxon)'''\n\n(No. 3941 - 1982-1984)\n|'''Army Jeep'''\n(No.3957 - 1983-1984)\n|-\n|'''Peterbilt Dump Truck'''\n'''(Red and Tan with Black Stripes)'''\n\n(No.3905 - 1984-1985)\n|'''Tank Trailer''' \n'''(Dupont)'''\n\n(No. 3942 - 1982)\n|'''Fire Truck''' \n'''(Lights, Bell, & Working Ladder)'''\n\n(No. 3911 - 1983-1985)\n|-\n|'''Peterbilt Dump Truck''' \n'''(Blue and Silver)'''\n\n(No.3912 - 1983-1985)\n|'''Tank Trailer''' \n'''(Borden's)'''\n\n(No. 3943 - 1982)\n|'''Peterbilt Wrecker with Disabled Car''' \n'''(Lighted Black Peterbilt with Shell logo; White Firebird)'''\n\n(No. 3918 - 1984, 1985)\n|-\n|'''Lighted Peterbilt Dump Truck''' \n'''(Red and Black)'''\n\n(No. 3937 - 1984, 1985)\n|'''Auto Transport with 4 Cars'''\n(No. 3946 - 1983, 1984)\n|'''G.I.

Some were based on designs which were originally part of the Tyco model railroad range. A full list appears later, but they are each worth describing in detail.\n\n'''Gravel''' \u2013 There was a small brown '''Gravel Unloading''' bin designed to sit under a length of single track that had a small oblong opening and a flat [[billboard]] at the end, where a single green 'Gravel' sticker was applied facing the track. The rear side was heavily reinforced by two half round molded pillars. As the gravel trailer was reversed into this, a raised portion of the roadway engaged with and opened the shutter underneath the trailer, causing the gravel to fall through the opening and into the bin.\n\nThis special track was later modified, gaining a box with raised sides around the opening, presumably to prevent spillages. Meanwhile, two long slots were also added on the sides to enable it to lock over the front of the gravel hopper to form the '''Elevated Gravel Unloader''' (see below). At the same time the billboard at the end was made double sided, by removing the reinforcing ribs at the rear, so that it could now take a green and white 'Gravel' sticker on each face.\n\nThe brown gravel bin was originally supplied with a tan-painted floor, discontinuing that was probably an early cost-cutting measure.\n\nTo fill the gravel trailer, there was an orange '''Operating Overhead Gravel Hopper''' that stood on a gantry over another type of single-road section (this was also used under the '''Barrel Loader'''). As the gravel trailer was reversed under the hopper it opened a shutter and was filled with gravel, ready to be driven away. This hopper was supplied with a small billboard type 'Gravel' sign that attached to the front of the hopper by two prongs. These are quite vulnerable and today are nearly always found broken. Adhesive putty can be used to mount billboards with broken prongs on the frame of the orange hopper. This is where it was often shown on the set box illustrations - (See Tyco Truck Resource link below).\n\nThe same hopper could be used as part of the '''Elevated Gravel Unloader''' which consisted of a set of '''Elevated Piers''' and a later version of the section of track supplied with the '''Gravel Unloading''' bin. This time that unloading track was intended to be positioned above the hopper, making it possible to fill your gravel trailer, drive around the circuit and then put that same gravel back in the same hopper ready to do it all again! The included instruction sheet shows a track diagram of how to arrange the track to achieve this and details where to position all six graduated height Elevated Piers.\n\nThe '''Gravel Supply Terminal''' was a 'dock' where a gravel trailer could park. There was a small brown building with a black roof at the far end.  Although there was no loading or unloading here, a neat little mechanism allowed the Semi-Tractor to reverse in and automatically hitch or un-hitch the trailer as required.\n\nThe same dock molding was used for the '''Freight Terminal''' where one of the Box Trailers could be parked, which worked in the same way. This had an even smaller yellow hut with a gray roof at the far end. Usually the gravel terminal mechanism has fewer moving parts than that in the freight terminal, but on early examples the mechanisms were identical.\n\nOriginal US-1 gravel was made of small plastic pellets and was supplied in a sealed clear plastic packet, but is often lost. [[Mung bean|Mung Beans]] look similar and make a perfect replacement.\n\n'''Crates''' \u2013 These are sturdy looking objects which were set out on a gray platform outside a cream shed. This was the '''Crate Loader'''. As the flat trailer was reversed in, it pushed the platform back into the shed and the crates went onto the trailer.\n\nThe '''Crate Unloader''' is a light gray platform at one side of a single track with a small yard on the other. Access was through a tall dark gray hoop from which a hinged flap is hanging. The ominous yellow and black hatchings and the words \u2018Unload Here\u2019 are a clue to what happens \u2013 the trailer loaded with crates is reversed under the flap, which hinges open away from the main road, allowing the trailer and crates to pass beneath, but as the trailer is withdrawn, the flap locks vertical and rigid, then brutally tears the crates from the trailer onto the floor, irrespective of any \u2018Fragile\u2019, \u2018Handle With Care\u2019 or \u2018This Way Up\u2019 stickers that might be applied to them.\n\nIn the Army Transport set this Action Accessory became an '''Ammunition Dump''' with different stickers and the crates were a darker brown. Replica crates have been produced but were not widely available. If originals or replicas are unavailable, a 1\" Wooden Cube suffices. \n\n'''Car Loader''' \u2013 Similar in principle to the crate loader, a double-deck red hollow \u2018cartridge\u2019 is loaded up with the four brightly colored automobiles \u2013 two on each level. The yellow [[Car carrier trailer|car trailer]] reverses against the cartridge, moving it back against a tall red stop block. This causes the four cars to roll forward and fill the two decks of the trailer. The '''Car Unloader''' is a long roadway with an orange gantry leading to two ramps. As the Auto Transporter trailer reverses in, it engages with the gantry, causing the decks to rise up at the cab end, encouraging the cars to roll out of the trailer, onto the ramps and finally come to a rest, spread out on the black cardboard [[Parking Lot]] that is part of this item.\n\n'''Logs''' - These were brown-stained 9mm-diameter wood [[dowel]]s 1.5\u201d long and could be loaded into the dump truck by the '''Log Loader/Elevated Log Loader''', which held the loading device high on an orange girder gantry. It is designed to sit under a high-level roadway, so the loading rig is alongside. The actual loading part consisted of a sloping tray in which the logs are laid. This has a lever that is activated by the tipper truck reversing alongside. This released some of the logs into the truck. The loading portion could be removed from the girder base and clipped alongside track at ground level if desired. The actuating lever is quite fragile and many found today are broken. The lever tends to strike most larger passing vehicles when the loader is clipped in place.\n\n'''Operating Log-Loading Bulldozer''' - is a mechanical accessory of the type for which Tyco were famous. The bulldozer is activated by the motor of the truck that is being loaded. This is [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmitted]] to the mechanism by rollers. Once the truck was reversed in, it rested against a stop block. The power is kept on, causing the [[bulldozer]] to push the logs up a gentle slope and into the body of the truck. There is a driver wearing a blue uniform who sat in the controls of the bulldozer. He is prone to breakage or being lost, as are the exhaust pipes. Once the logs have been loaded and the truck has left, the bulldozer needs resetting by hand and the stock of logs, replenishing. Logs are often missing but dowelling of a suitable thickness (8mm-diameter adequately substitutes the original 9mm size) can be cut to length and stained in a commercial wood stain, or even tea or coffee, to look much the same as the originals.\n\n'''Boulders''' - There is an identical '''Boulder Loading Bulldozer''' which came with some boulders (these are actual small stones not imitations) instead of logs. This is much less common than the log-loading version and seems to have been introduced later. Today suitable replacement stones can be obtained from hobby stores. Tumbled and glazed ones reduce friction and avoid scuffing the surface of the accessory.\n\n'''Pipes''' - The '''Operating Crane Pipe Loader''' was another mechanically activated accessory borrowed from Tyco model railroads. The drive was the same as the bulldozer but activated a crane with a rigid wire hook in the shape of an 'L' to move in a back and forth, up and down movement. As it moved, it scooped up a pipe and deposited it in the rear of the waiting truck which supplied the power. It continued in the same movement while the power was applied. The pipes were 14mm-diameter wide white plastic tubular moulding, in 10mm lengths. These were held on edge in a narrow sloping trough, molded into the base, presenting their open side ready for the crane to engage. As one was taken, the next rolled into place ready for the crane to swing back. The crane did not need any manual intervention, other than more pipes being added when they ran out. Pipes, like logs and gravel are often missing but 15mm-diameter plastic water pipe cut into 10mm lengths makes a perfect substitute.\n\n'''Barrels''' - These are 13mm-diameter, 19mm long and have one end sealed. They are usually molded in off white plastic, but were dark butter yellow in the Army Transport set (with wrap around yellow 'Diesel' stickers) and white in the Stomper Set. The same barrel-molding was used as a load for a brown slat-sided semi-trailer in the TYCO TCR series, although in a luminous yellow plastic.\n\nThese were held in the '''Barrel Loader''' - a brown sloping rack mounted on a yellow girder frame. As the tipper truck reversed, it engaged with a lever that released some barrels, which rolled from the rack into the truck. A version with a blue sloping rack and the same yellow frame was shown in publicity material and on the carton of the Motor City set. All examples found have the same brown loader as all the others, but with '''Motor City Oil Co.''' stickers with blue writing on a white background. As yet, no substitute barrels have been found, but a 19mm-long, suitable-diameter pipe or dowel would probably suffice.\n\n'''Unloading Yards''' - There were two varieties, the more common '''Pipe and Log Unloading Yard''', which had a grey base and brown walls. This was sold separately, as well as being in most in most sets, and also appeared with blue walls in the 3209 Motor City Set. The blue unloading yard is labeled with Goodyear stickers and according to catalog illustrations was intended to receive tires, although a way of loading them was not devised. In the Army Transport Set, the standard brown-walled Unloading Yard became an '''Army Dump''' with different stickers.\n\nThe second smaller Unloading Yard arrived later and is much harder to find. It is on a 9\" 45 degree double turnout supplied in the 3213 Highways Wrecker Set and 3219 Night Haulers Set. Originally this track was just a double turnout, but a small unloading yard with brown walls was added on one side of the junction and most of these sections that are found have this.\n\nThe Unloading Yards worked by the lip at the entrance of the yard engaging with the 'steps' or 'mud flaps' on the rear of the reversing tipper's bucket. This causes it to rise, the tailgate to open and the goods to slide out into the yard. Logs, pipes, barrels, tires and presumably boulders could all be deposited in the unloading yards but not gravel, simply because the rear of the tipper was too large to go under the hopper.\n\n'''Airport''' - This mechanical accessory lacks any loading or unloading function. The rollers transmit the drive from the vehicle to the orange [[radar]] dish on a white cap, which rotates atop the terminal building. Attached to the inside of the cap is a long, rigid wire. On the far end of this is a small plastic plane. As the radar revolves in an [[Clockwise|anti-clockwise]] direction, the plane circulates the tower, soaring up and coming back down, over and over again, almost landing and then taking off. There is a cardboard mat supplied for the building to stand on which includes a short section of [[Runway|runway]].\n\nThis is popular at shows, causing gasps and wows as the plane appears to fly. There are two planes provided and they are both rather small for the scale of the trucks and the buildings. One of them is in [[FedEx]] livery, so a good vehicle to use with this would be the FedEx delivery van or the Airport Taxi, whilst the Semi-Tractor shown on the box looks rather out of place.\n\nThe radar dish is fragile and often broken or missing. The walls are blue and the windows lined in white with the word 'Airport' on the blue roof in big white letters. This was mainly sold as a separate item but appeared in one set (in this form), the 3225 Coast to Coast Set.\n\nThe Airport appeared again with brown walls and a gray roof, as the '''Forest Rescue''' centre in the very rare 3211 Stomper Set. This time the radar and cap were moulded in butter yellow and the plane has simpler decoration to allow for the application of the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] stickers and Forest Rescue markings.\n\n'''G. I. Joe Satellite Launcher''' - This consisted of a two-piece sculpted concrete effect [[launch pad]] area with a straight approach track at the centre of one side. The base unit for the pad was clearly derived from the 3440 Unloading Yard.\n\nThe pivoting launching [[Gantry (rocketry)|gantry]] folds down horizontally, in line with the roadway, in order to engage with a [[missile]] loaded on a flatbed trailer as it is reversed towards it. In this position the launch gantry engages with the hollow missile and as the trailer backs further the gantry pivots to bring the missile to the upright position.\n\nMissiles are normally white with a gray cap but a few rare examples are known to have red caps. The gantry is a very delicate white plastic molding and many found today have broken pivot arms. This accessory was exclusive to the GI Joe set and was never available separately.\n\n'''Garage Type Buildings''' - This basic structure appeared in different colours, with different signs to serve as three differently purposed buildings, all with road access:\n\n1/ '''Highway Wrecker Set with Lighted Wrecker, Tow Car & Garage''' - The building was yellow with an orange roof and petrol pump. There also a special piece of single straight track with switch that allowed the towed car, the White Firebird, to be unhitched as it was reversed in to the opening.\n\n2/ '''Fire Station with Switch Track & Storage Yard''' - was a red version of the building with a black roof. This came off a different track section that formed a tuning-fork shape. The Fire station stood over the right lane, whilst the left lane was open. As a vehicle drove in to one lane, the turnout automatically switched to the other, isolating the first vehicle. There was a representation of a [[Siren (alarm)|siren]] on the roof of this building, which looks a bit like chimney.\n\n3/ '''Garage with Switch Track & Truck Stop''' - This was similar to the fire station, but had white walls, a blue roof, red windows, etc. It had the same track section as the fire station and operated in the same way. There was no siren or petrol pump.\n\n'''Flashing Danger Track''' - came with a '''15\" Straight Squeeze Track''' where one lane moved towards the other to avoid a hazard. This made it impossible for two vehicles to pass simultaneously. There is a red beacon with a flashing yellow light that sits at the side of the road warning oncoming vehicles. This accessory needed two AA batteries.\n\n'''3673 Overhead Interstate Highway Signs''' were sold in packs. These contained six gray over-road lattice gantries that each had two blank sign panels and sheets of different stickers to apply to them. They were also supplied in every US-1 set, including the Stomper Set with some special labels, including one for a Stomper Garage.\n\nMost of the stickers provided relate to the various action stations: Log Loader 3 Miles Ahead, Dump Site, Motor City Car Lot, Freight Terminal, Gravel Terminal, Gravel Hopper, Oil Refinery, etc. (There was never an Oil Refinery Action Station). The stickers have a tendency to dry out and fall off over time and the gantries themselves are delicate and prone to breakage, deformation and yellowing.\n\nThe earlier gantries have a clearance height of 60mm from the ground and have 35mm long flat feet on either side intended to be tucked under the track. These are not very effective at standing up and are too low for the loaded car transporter to pass beneath.\n\nThe later type of gantries have a 70mm clearance from the ground and the feet are only 25mm long, but each has a wedge shape projecting against the side of the track. The newer design clips positively against the track and usually remains there.\n\nIn place, the gantries are scenic, but tend to obstruct the cleaning of contact rails or attending to a vehicle.\n\n'''3768 Overhead Highway Light''' is a neat little gray streetlamp, set on a huge base that housed an AA battery and was operated by a switch. The bulb is a Grain of Wheat type mounted in the head with a reflector behind. These are surprisingly effective when they work, but they often don't, due to failed bulbs, broken switches and corrosion from leaky batteries.\n\nAlthough never sold separately, the light gray '''US-1 Elevated Piers''' appeared in four of the trucking sets and were a key part of the '''3453 Elevated Gravel Unloader'''. A set of piers included two of each. Pier 1 is 19mm high, number 2 is 38mm and pier 3 reached a height of 57mm. In the top of each pier was a 11mm-diameter round hole that engaged with the corresponding round lugs on the underside of most lengths of US-1 Track.\n\nBesides the piers, elevated items in the US-1 series included the '''Elevated Gravel Unloader''' which required the track to be at 73mm from the base and the '''Elevated Log Loader''' which needed it to be at 76mm high. The US-1 piers are the same as those sold to use with Tyco Quick Clik racing track although these were often cream instead of light gray. The shape of the pillars (a gently tapered series of progressively smaller concentric oblongs), goes back to the Tyco Pro series of track, although the top fixings of those were not compatible with US-1 or Quick Clik.\n\n'''Working Height:''' Although sold for potential use with an HO-scale model railroad, the US-1 elevated track has a clearance of 57mm provided by the high level piers, which is insufficient to clear a train running below. This is made worse if a 'roadbed' type model railroad track is used, where the track sits on some imitation ballast, raising the height of the rails by several mm.\n\n57mm is also too low to allow a loaded car transporter pass underneath. However, as the elevated piers are hollow, it is possible to stack them upon each other, to give the extra height required, provided enough can be found.\n\nIt is still possible to get packs of brand new unused (old stock) Tyco piers from at least one supplier on the Internet. One layout that can be seen on a video app has a high level circuit supported by 87mm high pillars which have been created from 3 of the middle rise piers firmly stacked together. This height is enough to clear an HO Railroad on a roadbed type track, as well as any US-1 road circuit running a loaded car transporter.\n\nThere were also three [[Plastic model|Plastic Construction Kits]]: a '''[[Mobil Oil|Mobil Truck Station]]''', a '''[[Howard Johnson's|Howard Johnson's Truck Stop]]''', and a '''P.I.E. Freight Terminal''', each molded in several colors to be glued together. These were supplied by Pola, in what was then [[West Germany]] and were also sold for a time as part of the Tyco model railroad range, but in plain Tyco 'Brown Box' packaging and with slightly different names and in some cases different colourings or markings. The Truck station and Freight Terminal kits have appeared in other ranges over the years and are still available, but now as part of the [[Wm. K. Walthers|Walther's]] Trainline range and with different colourings and markings.\n\n=== Sets ===\nMost US-1 pieces came together in a series of sets, based on certain duties a truck would need to do. Numerous sets came out between 1981 and 1986, each with varied action accessories as described above. Some sets were themed, such as the 3235 Road & Rail set, with a complete railroad and two of the 3727 grade crossings, or the 3217 G.I. Joe High Adventure Set, based around soldiers and their equipment.\n\nThe vehicles supplied in the sets were however only a small selection of those available: The Peterbilt tipper appeared in most sets (except the G.I. Joe, Highway Wrecker and Stomper Sets) - Usually in the standard lime green, but was olive green especially for the army transport set and is believed to have been red in the rare Empire Set\n\nThe Peterbilt Semi-tractor was also included in most sets, (except Army Transport, Fire Alert and Stomper sets) the colors being red with white stripes or yellow with orange and black stripes (both are consequently common colors for this vehicle). It was in Army Green in the GI Joe set.\n\nThe Kenworth Semi-tractor was only sold in two sets - appearing in blue with stripes in the Fire Alert set, whilst the olive version was exclusive to the Army Transport set. In the Night Haulers set the Green tipper and the Red Peterbilt semi-tractor were both lighted versions\n\nOther vehicles featuring in sets are the Fire Truck, Wrecker, Dummy Firebird, Stomper Blazer, Stomper Pick Up and the Cobra Troop carrier which was only available in the G.I. Joe set\n\nThe G.I. Joe set also came with soldiers, tanks, jeeps, a helicopter, a boat, a bridge, paratroopers, a die-cut Secret Cobra Command Headquarters, a full-color G.I. Joe Action Battle Mat (with Mountain Backdrop) and a unique '''Satellite Launching Pad with Gantry''' Action Accessory.\n\nArguably, one of the rarest and most expensive sets has a [[Schaper Toys|Schaper]] Stompers theme. Only produced in 1985, complete examples are very rare. It contains a special version of the Airport in brown (3434), unique this set. A die-cut cardboard building can be folded to make a garage for the cars. The set sits on a Stompers-themed playmat, with a portion of the track supported by Elevated Piers.\n\nAnother rare set is the 3213 Highway Wrecker Set, released in 1984. This set contains a gravel loader, gravel unloader, garage, double turnout, special straight with [[Telephone booth|phone booth]], billboard sign. The phone booth straight and [[billboard]] sign were only available in this set and are extremely difficult to procure.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Set Ref.\n!1981\n!1982\n!1983\n!1984\n!1985\n!1986\n|-\n|3201\n|Big City Trucking\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n|3202\n!\n|City Hauler Starter\n!\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n|3203\n!\n!\n|Big Hauler\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n|3204\n!\n!\n|Army Transport\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n|3205\n|Cross Country Trucking\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n|3206\n!\n|Interstate Delivery\n!\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n|3208\n!\n!\n|Interstate Delivery\n|Interstate Delivery\n|Interstate Delivery\n|Interstate Delivery\n|-\n|3209\n!\n!\n|Motor City\n|Motor City\n|Motor City\n|Motor City\n|-\n|3210\n|Interstate Trucking\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n|3211\n!\n!\n!\n!\n|Stomper\nHigh Adventure\n!\n|-\n|3212\n!\n|Highway Construction\n!\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n|3213\n!\n!\n!\n|Highway Wrecker\n!\n!\n|-\n|3215\n|Long Haul Trucker\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n|3216\n!\n|Highway Overpass\n!\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n|3217\n!\n!\n!\n|G.I.

This is usually because most sections of US-1 track were just a gray variant of the Quick Clik black racing track. Some items can be found with a racing and US-1 reference underneath - the Squeeze track and the Lane changer for example, but even then the number molded is usually a part number rather than a catalogue number. For example the bespoke 9\" Junction carries the reference 3016 beneath but was listed as 3700. Most separate track appears to have been sold in pairs in carded blister packs except the 9\" junction and the railroad crossing which were individually sold in blister packs and the squeeze track which was sold with the flashing beacon in an illustrated box.\n\nWe have listed the special and rare 'set only' items of track in the table above by their molded numbers, to help identify them.\n\nThere were several different '''Assortment Packs''' advertised in the annual catalogs. These contained substantial quantities of track, and other items such as Street Lamps or Overhead Signs. The contents and reference numbers changed over time, but the packs always appeared to contain three transformers and three controllers, which seems rather odd. It is not known how these were packaged and they were never shown on retail price lists, so they may well have been aimed at dealers.\n\nBoulder Loading Bulldozer*  - Two reference numbers have come to light for this item: 3414 is shown on literature enclosed with the accessory, whilst 3470 appears in the 1984 and 1985 Tyco catalogs. Both are shown above. Anyone with access to a box for this please feel free to update!\n\n\n== TYCO US-1 Catalogues and literature  or  \"It Ain't Necessarily So\" ==\nThe US-1 range first appeared in the joint Tyco racing and model railroad catalogue in 1981 and was then shown every year until 1986. It featured in a number of other promotional leaflets too, as well as magazine adverts etc.\n\nOne big issue for the collector is the accuracy of how the range was represented in some of those illustrations and also the images on the various set and accessory boxes. The set boxes also carried large artist's renderings of other makes and types of trucks and trailers that didn't appear in the range. How things were illustrated was not necessarily how they actually appeared when sold.\n\nThe first example of this is the track with yellow centre lines. This was produced only briefly, but was still being illustrated in catalogues several years later. Some of the images of the assembled set contents showed yellow lines throughout their time in the range, although this wasn't the case.\n\nThe second issue is of prototype or pre-production models being shown instead of the final version. This is particularly true of the crate unloader, gravel hopper, gravel bin and pipe loading crane illustrations, some of which are clearly not the versions actually produced, all differing in several details.\n\nThe third example is the type of trucks shown in the various set content illustrations. If you see the section on lighted vehicles you will see that these were only supplied in one set. There were also clear differences between lighted vehicles and those without lights, most noticeably the two rectangular headlights either side of the grill were open instead of solid, with a clear plastic lens inside.\n\nIf you study various set illustrations you will see that many of the vehicles shown accompanying some of the sets are actually lighted ones, even though these were not supplied in that particular set. Conversely it appears that early some early lighted trucks were listed without them actually being identified as such. The lighted Semi-Tractor in Yellow with orange and black stripes appears to be one example of this.\n\nFinally, a few items are shown in a color finish the actual items never carried. For example the top section of the motor city barrel loader is shown as being blue, but was in reality just the normal brown version with Motor City Stickers. The US-1 Police car was a two door Dodge Charger but at least once it was shown as a four door Plymouth Satellite with a large blower.\n\nSo even though Tyco may have illustrated it, that does not mean that you can find it!\n\n==Body Shells - Before, After & Outside of US-1 ==\nThe Peterbilt Semi-Tractor had preceded the US-1 range, being introduced in 1979 on the lighted HP2 racing chassis and a slotless, lighted Command Control chassis. The latter was black with flames and no hole in the fifth wheel - or sometimes a hole, which was too small for the later trailers.\n\nCommand Control was Tyco\u2019s first attempt at slotless racing and a direct competitor to the original [[Ideal Toy Company|Ideal]] [[Total Control Racing]] or TCR. The same body was later used again in the Tyco version of the Slotless TCR system produced from 1991 to 1993\n\nBoth the Peterbilt and Kenworth Semi-tractor moldings were used in racing form, with a chromed plastic fifth wheel, which was initially attached by a rivet and two melted-over plastic side pegs to the platform behind the driver\u2019s cab. On later Peterbilts the rivet was deleted and the side pegs were considered enough, although the rivet hole remained. \n\nTwo versions of the Kenworth 'Cab over' Semis were available in racing form between 1983 and 1985 with HP7 chassis. One is mainly black with a red stripe that has white edges and the other mainly white with blue patches and orange stripes. \n\nMost of the racing and Slotless Semi-tractor bodies can be easily adapted to fit a US-1 chassis by drilling out the hollow rivet and pegs that hold the chromed plastic fifth wheel in place. Any vehicle so modified will have three evenly spaced tell-tale holes visible on the platform just behind the cab. On some early examples of the Peterbilt Semi-Tractor this rear platform is lower and consequently these bodies will not fit a US-1 chassis without further work.\n\nThe Peterbilt Semi bodies that won't fit on a US-1 chassis can be identified by their colors: Baby Blue with Black Stripes or White with Red Stripes. Also some in Yellow with fine Orange and Red Stripes or Black with Flames used the original version of the body as well as the later version that will fit. Some of these had gray grills and exhausts instead of Chrome.\n\nOf the many US-1 trailers, only the box type made it into the racing series, appearing in various color schemes. The later had a redesigned reversible bogie with a slot-guide plus a bar magnet to encourage it to stay on the track, although some are known to carry the US-1-type bogie. At the front end, these box trailers kept their US-1 style pivot, allowing them to be run with US-1 Semi-Tractors.\n\nThe Dodge Van can be found in various liveries in racing form and also in Tyco TCR form as the Blue and White \u2018Emergency\u2019 Jam Car. This featured the red light-bar that had been used on the US-1 Mack Fire Truck.\n\nPolice Cars: There is a US-1 publicity photo showing a four-door [[Plymouth Satellite]] in use as the US-1 Police Car: with roof lights, a large hood mounted blower and side pipes, but this was never released as part of the US-1 range. (See the Tyco Resource in the '''External Links''' section Below - Vehicles page)\n\nThe US-1 \u2018911\u2019 police car and Airport Taxi were based on the two-door [[Dodge Charger]] that had been introduced to the Tyco range back in 1977. This was done without \u2018door-netting\u2019 on the glazing and the body was modified to take the roof lights for the police car. The Charger remained in the Tyco racing range until 2005.\n\nOther US-1 vehicles that can be found with a racing chassis are the Jeep in civilian colors which was available from 1980 to 1983 and the Black and Gold Firebird which was sold from 1979 to 1983 but was to eventually reappear in 2005 and 2006 in two special sets.\n\nThere are eight non-US-1 versions of the Stomper Blazer, five of which were equipped with lights, that the US-1 version never carried. One was sold as part of the Faller AMS series. The three 'flame paint' versions had no lights\n\nThe Mack Fire Truck was also sold as part of the Faller AMS range, both individually (cat no. 5631) and in the 'Feuer Alarm' set (Cat no. 3907), which also contained a lighted blue and white racing version of the Pontiac Firebird. These were both introduced in 1983 and the truck was catalogued for at least two years. From two examples seen, it would appear to be the standard US-1 offering, with the same chassis, mechanical bell, lights and American markings. Even the molded 'Tyco H.K.'markings were underneath.\n\nUnusually, at this late stage, Faller AMS had extensive links to Aurora AFX. The Fire Truck appeared in the Faller range alongside some of the same Semi-Tractors and trailers which were also sold as part of the Aurora 'Big Ryder' series, (which was their answer to Tyco US-1), as well as other Tyco offerings.\n\n== Spare Parts, Running and Collecting ==\n'''Spare parts:''' Some parts, such as pick-ups, were originally available from the manufacturers, but today these are hard to find. Luckily a number of people have begun producing parts to keep US-1 vehicles running. Tires which fit all the standard vehicles are available from a number of vendors. Specially stamped and shaped replacement pick-ups can be obtained too, which fit all the vehicles in the series, (including the Stompers). Recently, batches of light bars for the wrecker and fire engine have been made, along with the unique tires for the Stomper and some US-1-type metal guide pins. Their availability can be seen on the Internet.\n\n'''Motor''': The motor used throughout US-1 was a standard [[Mabuchi Motor|Mabuchi]] item and can also be found fitted to other vehicles, including 'Ideal' Slot Cars, later some slotless Tyco TCR 'Jam Cars'. [[New old stock]] spares can sometimes be found and many similar, but not identical motors were made. When checking a Mabuchi motor to see if it will be a suitable replacement, the available length of the shaft to take the worm gear and the position of the contacts (which is on the side of US-1 motors) need to be considered.\n\n'''Customised items and Replicas:''' One vendor specialises in making double 90 degree turnouts out of two single ones, along with 9\" and 6\" single straights. All very handy when maximising layout space. Vendors offering trucks, trailers, loads and Action Accessories in custom finishes, such as FedEx, can often be found on a well known Internet auction site\n\n'''Running suggestions:''' To run US-1 (and not use the original control gear), wires can be carefully soldered to the underside of the two contact strips, but given the age and condition of the track, it is recommended that as the layout size increases, the number of 'feeds' to each circuit are increased to avoid voltage drop. US-1 track has not always aged well and much found will have discolored or had minor bits broken off at the joints. To obtain the best running results, use the best track available and clean it well: Wash and scrub with a good detergent and then dry it thoroughly. Give the contact strips a rub with an abrasive track-cleaning block, (like those used for model railroads) and pay particular attention to the areas where the metal contact strips join. Treatment of the metal strips with a non-damaging contact oil can be helpful, but try to avoid getting any on the road surface.\n\n'''Integration with Other Makes:''' US-1 vehicles will run on most other makes of HO slot car track, but the Action Accessories can only be connected to Tyco US-1 track via the special US-1 turnouts. US-1 track is a gray version of Tyco Quick Clik and this is compatible with the later Mattel track.  Adaptor sections to join Quick Clik to the older Tyco Pro and Life-Like Racing tracks have been made, but only the [[Round 2 (company)|Auto World]] 'Tyco Quick Clik to Tomy AFX' type appears to still be in production.\n\nVehicles from this range are relatively wide, so if two trucks are simultaneously run on an earlier, narrower slot-car track, like Playcraft Highways or [[Aurora Plastics Corporation|Aurora Model Motoring]], they will collide.\n\nNon US-1 vehicles can be run on Trucking layouts, but lighter types like Aurora [[Pancake (slot car)|TJets]] will get 'beached' on the sprung copper tongues at the junctions, wheras Magnetic slot cars will generally cope quite well as they usually have enough 'virtual' weight to pass through them.\n\n'''Control Gear:''' In the experience of this contributor, (from running various makes of model electric roadways for around 35 years), the best type of controller to use is a Model Railroad 'feedback' type. These give good speed control and steady constant speed running, (resistance types of many makes have been tried but can cause erratic running). Videos exist showing the trucks being successfully run with Model Railroad [[Digital Command Control]] 'electronic chips' fitted. This is not for the faint-hearted and can also be expensive.\n\n'''Servicing:''' Any vehicle obtained will need a good clean, and the tunnel weight temporarily removed by prising the side with a small flat screwdriver. This allows removal of fluff, which accumulates around the worm screw and rear axle. Lightly oil the motor bearings, axles and gears, replace the tires if they are hardened and the pick ups, too, if they are 'rutted'.\n\n'''Fitting Replacement Pick Ups:''' Do not pre-bend them, the cast plate that holds them into the chassis will automatically set them to correct angle as they are screwed into place. (Pre-bending them can exert to much force on the roadway, resulting in lost traction). However it is important to ensure that the folded 'retaining brackets' at the ends of the strips are free to travel up and down in their open mountings. On the Semi-Tractors ensure that the 'return' portion of these brackets does not rub against the Fifth Wheel weight, or it will stop it moving freely and may cause a short circuit.\n\n'''Videos:''' Although today models and sets are bought by collectors, many US-1 trucks are operated either at home or at public shows. Videos showing this can be found on some video apps. Some of the films show the various loading and unloading accessories in action and original commercials for the range can be found, too: Search for 'Tyco Trucking' or 'Tyco US-1'.\n\n==External links==\nUS-1 Trucking Resource [http://tycotrain.tripod.com/tycous1trucking/]\n\nDerek A Brand - Tribute Page = [http://www.daveshobby.net/derek-brand-tribute.html]\n\nHistory of HO Slot Car racing [http://www.hoslotcarracing.com/History.html]\n\nTyco Catalogs (Year by year, page by page) [https://www.hoseeker.org/tyco.htm]\n\n==See also==\n* [[U.S. 1 (comics)]], a [[Marvel Comics]] series licensed from this toyline, set in the [[Marvel Universe]].\n\n[[Category:Toy cars and trucks]]\n\n\n{{Toy-stub}}\n", "text_old": "[[File:US1Introduction1981.jpg|thumb|1981 Tyco Catalog Introduction to US-1 Electric Trucking]]\n\n'''US-1 Electric Trucking''', produced by [[Tyco Toys]] from 1981 to 1986, is a line of [[HO scale]] slot car sets focused around trucks. It was similar to previous Tyco HO Scale racing sets; however the vehicles could be run in reverse due to having guide pins at the front and rear of the chassis. The line was unique because most of the vehicles were able to pick up and deliver loads from various \u2018Action Accessories\u2019 without intervention from the operator.\n\nOne of those involved in the development of US-1 was Derek A. Brand (1926 to 2012) who had designed the first HO slot system - [[mettoy|Playcraft]] Electric Highways, which was launched in 1959. He also laid down the geometric principles of HO slot car track systems that Tyco and many other manufacturers followed for many years. (The 9\" roadway straight was derived from Atlas HO model railroad 'Snap Track', to enable his model highways use with model railroad layouts).\n\nWhile only lasting six years, a number of sets were made, with one being based on the [[G.I. Joe]] franchise. Many trucks, trailers, and other vehicles were produced, such as dump trucks, a car hauler and a fire truck. It was marketed under the tagline of \"You Control The Action!\"\n\n== How it works ==\n[[File:Custom Track Layout.jpg|left|thumb|Basic, Custom Track Layout]]\n'''Electrical''': The system was originally designed to be operated from a 6v dc supply, this later increased to 9v dc. [[Transformer]]s were supplied with the sets, but the vehicles can be safely worked from most modern conventional model railroad transformer/controllers, if the original US-1 control gear is not used.\n\n'''Track''': The trucks run on a gray variant of the Tyco Quick Clik track that provides power to the vehicles through two thin metal strips in the track, which is similar to many other HO scale road and racing systems. The track was initially produced with yellow centre lines and some other markings, although this is less common and most track was supplied unmarked.\n\nTwo types of trailing turnouts were made that allowed the vehicles to pass through unimpeded and then, if required, reverse back into a siding to access an Action Accessory. These junctions consisted of a sprung copper tongue that extended across the slot, interacting with the front and rear guide pins. A switchable '''Hi Adventure''' junction was supplied in the GI Joe set, which would allow vehicles to travel in either direction without being automatically directed into a siding. Various combinations of track sections were supplied in the sets, except the 45 degree 12\" radius curves, which were only sold separately and are hard to find. Other rare track pieces include the 9\" double turnout that only appeared in two sets and the Railroad [[grade crossing]].\n\n'''Chassis''': Longitudinal copper pick-up shoes span almost the entire length of the chassis, which transfer the power to the [[Electric motor|motor]]. The pick-ups were held in by screws and could be replaced, although some later vehicles are known to have rivets instead of screws. The motor itself is a universal clip-in type that uses a worm screw to turn a [[worm wheel]] on the rear axle. These worms and gears were originally brown, but on most vehicles they are white.\n\nAt the front and back of the chassis, guide pins keep the truck on the track, allowing it to go in reverse. Guide pins were originally brown plastic blades mounted on a wedge-shaped base, but later and most commonly, round metal pins were used. On most chassis there are two raised angled strips molded on either side of the guide pin mount, which stopped the original plastic guide blades rotating. Comparatively few chassis are without these. The actual pin mounting never changed and either type of pin can be fitted to any vehicle.\n\nThe rear axle has removable [[Synthetic rubber|rubber]] [[tires]], that will get hard over time and consequently lose grip. These occasionally require replacing. However the front axle, the extra axle on the three six-wheeled vehicles, all the axles on the trailers (and even those on the dummy Firebird) had hard plastic tires which run freely and with hardly any drag. Only the higher Stomper chassis had rubber tires front and rear.\n\nEach vehicle carries two weights - a flat plate at the front and a block at the rear with a tunnel to clear the worm gear. The rear weights vary in size to suit the vehicle. On the [[Semi-trailer truck]] (or [[Tractor unit]]) the rear weight was black and [[Casting (metalworking)|cast]] in the  form of a [[Fifth-wheel coupling]] where the trailer was attached. These give the vehicle more traction and help it to pass through the sprung junctions, which can cause lighter (non US-1) vehicles to stall.\n\n'''Working Features''': The Wrecker and the Fire Truck both carried flashing lights, the latter carried a bell, too. These were [[Mechanism (engineering)|mechanically]] activated by a geared drive taken off the rear axle. Despite those features being added, the core chassis inside these two vehicles, were the same as all the others in the range except the Stompers, which used a bespoke deeper chassis [[Injection moulding|molding]] to accommodate the lower reach required by the pick ups, which was necessary because of the higher tires.\n\nOperation of the accessories is done automatically, usually by contact with the truck or trailer. However, in the case of the crane, bulldozer, and airport, the accessory is operated by the vehicle's drive wheels acting on a roller, (as it continues to be powered in reverse, whilst pushing against a stop block).\n\n'''Controllers''': Since this was a roadway system instead of a race track, the controllers were not hand-held, but were intended to resemble the [[dashboard]] of a truck. Originally separate and attached to the track via some wires, each controller had a [[steering wheel]] (to control the speed) and a switch mounted to the side (to control the direction).\n\nThe first type of controllers are known to exist both with and without the yellow lines on the road surface. The output from the transformer was plugged directly into the terminal rail attached to the two controllers.\n\nLater these individual units were simplified so the steering wheel did both speed and direction. By this time yellow markings had stopped being applied to the road surface.\n\nThe final type of controllers came as one twin unit in the form of a single box, attached to a molded base on the side of the track and these also only had two steering wheels, which were mounted side by side. The transformer connection now plugged directly into the control box instead of the track. \n\nControllers are usually red but some of the final version were molded in green for the G.I. Joe and Stomper sets. The green ones only exist in this final twin version.\n\n== Vehicles & Trucks ==\n[[File:4 US-1 Trucks.jpg|thumb|2 Dump Trucks, a Semi Truck, & Fire Truck]]\nThe core chassis of all vehicles are of the same basic design throughout the range, (with only the Stompers using a different chassis molding) but there were many body types and different colors.\n\nThere were two makes of '''[[Semi-trailer truck|Semi-Tractor]]''' trucks modeled: One a [[Peterbilt]] conventional, the other a [[Kenworth]] C.O.E. ([[cab over engine]]). Both types had four wheels and were made to pull [[Semi-trailers]] in box, tank, flatbed, auto transporter and hopper varieties, using their exposed metal rear chassis weight which was also the Fifth Wheel Coupling.\n\nAll other vehicles except the wrecker and fire truck had plain rear chassis weights, which were hidden by the vehicle body.\n\nThere were three '''six-wheeled Peterbilt trucks''': [[dump truck]] (or tipper), troop carrier and a [[Vehicle recovery|Wrecker]]. On these, the extra axle was mounted under the body assembly.\n\n'''Other vehicles''' included a [[Mack Trucks|Mack]] [[Fire Truck]], [[police car]], [[Taxicab|taxi]], [[Pickup truck]], [[Dodge]] [[Panel van|delivery van]], [[ambulance]], [[Jeep]], and a [[Pontiac Firebird]] [[Coup\u00e9]] - The Firebird appeared in both powered (black color with gold eagle) and unpowered (white with black eagle) form, the latter for towing by the wrecker. The dummy car had a plastic chassis with a metal clip to help engage the jib of the wrecker.\n\n'''Body Colors''' were generally molded in pre-colored plastic, although the earliest known version of the Green and the Red Tipper, the Yellow/Orange and Red/White Strip Peterbilt Semi-tractors were molded in white plastic and given a painted finish. The same is true of the Mack Fire Truck, Airport Taxi, [[Goodyear Tires]] pick-up truck, Black Firebird and even the Police car, which was painted all over white before the blue panels, etc. were added. After-market re-sprays of models are becoming more common, too, they are sometimes offered for sale on Internet auction sites.\n\n'''Lights''': As well as the Wrecker and Fire Truck mentioned earlier, a number of Peterbilt trucks were made with working lights. These had a small bulb soldered to the two motor contacts. This nested in a recess within a clear plastic molding that plugged into the front grill and some openings in the cab roof. This also served as glazing in the cab windows.\n\nThe clear plastic transmitted the light from the bulb to the two rectangular headlights either side of the grille, two round lights in the bumper and an array on the cab roof. These lit up when the vehicle was travelling.\n\nThe radiator molding used on lighted trucks differed from the unlit ones as the rectangular headlights were left open, where normally they would be solid and in chrome finish like the rest of it. A similar molding to the clear one, but in dark plastic was also used in some trucks without lights, which makes them look as though they have heavily tinted windows!\n\nLighted versions of the following trucks are known: ''Peterbilt Semi-Tractors'': Yellow with Orange and Black Stripes, Red with White Stripes, Black with Gold Stripes, Yellow with Red Stripes. ''Peterbilt Tippers'' were also advertised with lights in the common Green, White with Brown and Orange Stripes and \u2018Dept of Highways\u2019 in Red and Black, however others are known such as the all over Red (Painted finish), Blue cab with the Yellow bucket and Blue cab with Silver bucket.\n\nLighted trucks were only supplied in one set 'Night Haulers',  which contained a green tipper and a red semi with white stripes. Although two lighted Kenworth trucks were sold in the racing series, there were none in the US-1 series. See '''Body Shells - Before, After & Outside of US-1''' \n\n'''Variations''': Over the years, a number of changes were made to the Peterbilt tipper mouldings. Following the release of the initial painted versions, production switched to pre-coloured plastic and a small ridge appeared lengthways in the middle of the rear of the dump bed, where the tailgate rested when shut. This ridge did not last long and was removed by the time the tail gate gained a bottom lug and matching receptor in the bucket to aid more secure closing. At the same time the originally round hinges became oval to allow the extra travel needed to open/close it.\n\nThe final change to the tipper bucket was when the tail gate changed to a fat 'T' shape, with 'stubs' added at the top on either side and the hinges were enlarged again and made thinner to accommodate these. This makes them rather fragile too. It is quite common to find these later hinges broken and the tailgate missing, whereas the earlier thicker hinges normally survive.\n\nFrom around 1983, Peterbilt Semis and Tippers both acquired an oval 'Peterbilt' logo on the sides of the hood and the front of the [[Radiator]]. The name \"Peterbilt\" can be clearly seen with a magnifier. Finally, when the tipper chassis was adapted with extra slots to take the troop-carrier body for the GI Joe set in 1984, the opening above the motor was changed from a square to a T shape.\n\nAs of April 2020, none of the plain Green Tippers or the common Semi-Tractors in either yellow and orange (with black stripes) or red (with white stripes)-(Unlighted version), have been found with the Peterbilt logos. Nor have any green Tippers been found with the troop carrier modifications to the base or with the final 'T' shaped tailgate and thinner hinges on the bucket. \n\nAs these trucks appeared in several sets that were available until the end of the range, this remains an interesting and so far unexplained anomaly. From the examples seen it would appear that the same is true for the less common red tipper, although this is thought to have only ever been included in one set. However, the red Semi-tractor with white stripes (lighted version), can be found both with and without the Peterbilt logos.\n\nAlthough the Stomper [[Blazer|Blazer]] enjoyed a very short life, variations are known: Test-shot moldings exist that include a clear plastic light bar, although no light bar has ever been found fitted on production models in this series, nor was any US-1 Blazer ever fitted with lights. The headlights on the body shell are just open round holes. Early bodies were supplied fitted with a pair of thin weights, secured sandwich-like, at the rear of the body, by two plastic prongs, melted over to hold them in place. Most examples found seem not to have these.\n\n'''Trailers''' The flat bed trailer comes in two distinct variations. The rear panel is either completely smooth or has a 6mm long ridge across the bottom. All the different color versions of the flat bed can be found both with and without this feature. \nThe ridge appears to have been added later as it also appears on a small number of hopper trailers. \n\nAll post US-1 Box trailers have this too. So far no tank trailers are known with this. See the section '''US-1 Body Shells - Before, After & Outside of US-1''' for information about the non US-1 versions of the Box trailer.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+List of Vehicles, Trucks, & Trailers\n!Trucks\n!Trailers\n!Vehicles\n|-\n|'''Peterbilt Truck Cab'''\n'''(Red with White Stripes)'''\n\n(No.3903 - 1981-1983)\n|'''Box Trailer''' \n'''(Bekins)'''\n\n(No. 3928 - 1981, 1982)\n|'''Stomper Blazer'''\n'''(White and Blue with Red Stripe)'''\n\n(No.3962 - 1985)\n|-\n|'''Peterbilt Truck Cab'''\n'''(Orange and Yellow with Black Stripes)'''\n\n(No.3904 - 1981-1982)\n|'''Gravel Trailer'''\n'''(Gravel Supply Company)'''\n\n(No. 3925 - 1981, 1982)\n|'''Stomper Blazer'''\n'''(Yellow/Gray/White with Orange Stripe)'''\n\n(No.3963 - 1985)\n|-\n|'''Peterbilt Truck Cab'''\n'''(Tan with Initials \"PB\" on Doors)'''\n\n(No.3908 - 1984-1985)\n|'''Gravel Trailer'''\n'''(Highway Construction Company)'''\n\n(No. 3926 - 1981-1984)\n|'''Stomper Pick-Up'''\n'''(Green and White with Black Stripes)'''\n\n(No.3965 - 1985)\n|-\n|'''Kenworth Truck Cab'''\n'''(Black with Yellow/Tan/Orange Stripes)'''\n\n(No.3909 - 1982-1985)\n|'''Box Trailer''' \n'''(Navajo)'''\n\n(No. 3930 - 1981, 1982)\n|'''Stomper Pick-Up'''\n'''(Yellow with Black and White Stripes)'''\n\n(No.3966 - 1985)\n|-\n|'''Kenworth Truck Cab'''\n'''(Blue with White/Yellow/Orange Stripes)'''\n\n(No.3910 - 1982)\n|'''Box Trailer'''\n'''(Pacific Intermountain Express)'''\n\n(No. 3927 - 1981, 1982)\n|'''Pick-Up Truck'''\n'''(Smith's Tire Orange and Black)'''\n\n(No.3951 - 1981-1982)\n|-\n|'''Peterbilt Truck Cab''' \n'''(Coastal Trucking Blue with Gold Stripes)'''\n\n(No.3913 - 1983-1985)\n|'''Box Trailer''' \n'''(Smith Transfer)'''\n\n(No. 3929 - 1981, 1982)\n|Dodge '''Van''' \n'''(Federal Express)'''\n\n(No.3952 - 1981-1982)\n|-\n|'''Kenworth Cab Over Truck Cab''' \n'''(Red/White/Orange)'''\n\n(No.3914 - 1983-1985)\n|'''Flatbed Trailer''' \n'''(Red Line)'''\n\n(No. 3931 - 1982)\n|Dodge Charger '''Police Car''' \n'''(Blue and White)'''\n\n(No.3953 - 1981-1984)\n|-\n|'''Lighted Peterbilt Truck Cab'''\n'''(Tan)'''\n\n(No. 3935 - 1984, 1985)\n|'''Flatbed Trailer''' \n'''(Roadway Express)'''\n\n(No. 3932 - 1982, 1983)\n|Dodge '''Ambulance'''\n(No.3954 - 1981-1984)\n|-\n|'''Lighted Peterbilt Truck Cab''' \n'''(Black with Gold Stripes)'''\n\n(No. 3939 - 1984, 1985)\n|'''Flatbed Trailer with 3 Crates''' \n'''(Roadway Express)'''\n\n(No. 3932 - 1984)\n|Dodge Charger '''Airport Taxi''' \n'''(Blue)'''\n\n(No.3955 - 1981-1982)\n|-\n|'''Peterbilt Dump Truck''' \n'''(Green)'''\n\n(No.3901 - 1981)\n|'''Tank Trailer''' \n'''(Shell)'''\n\n(No. 3940 - 1982-1984)\n|'''Pontiac Firebird''' \n'''(Black)'''\n\n(No.3956 - 1981-1984)\n|-\n|'''Peterbilt Dump Truck''' \n'''(Red)'''\n\n(No.3902 - 1981 and 1983)\n|'''Tank Trailer''' \n'''(Exxon)'''\n\n(No. 3941 - 1982-1984)\n|'''Army Jeep'''\n(No.3957 - 1983-1984)\n|-\n|'''Peterbilt Dump Truck'''\n'''(Red and Tan with Black Stripes)'''\n\n(No.3905 - 1984-1985)\n|'''Tank Trailer''' \n'''(Dupont)'''\n\n(No. 3942 - 1982)\n|'''Fire Truck''' \n'''(Lights, Bell, & Working Ladder)'''\n\n(No. 3911 - 1983-1985)\n|-\n|'''Peterbilt Dump Truck''' \n'''(Blue and Silver)'''\n\n(No.3912 - 1983-1985)\n|'''Tank Trailer''' \n'''(Borden's)'''\n\n(No. 3943 - 1982)\n|'''Peterbilt Wrecker with Disabled Car''' \n'''(Lighted Black Peterbilt with Shell logo; White Firebird)'''\n\n(No. 3918 - 1984, 1985)\n|-\n|'''Lighted Peterbilt Dump Truck''' \n'''(Red and Black)'''\n\n(No. 3937 - 1984, 1985)\n|'''Auto Transport with 4 Cars'''\n(No. 3946 - 1983, 1984)\n|'''G.I.

Some were based on designs which were originally part of the Tyco model railroad range. A full list appears later, but they are each worth describing in detail.\n\n'''Gravel''' \u2013 There was a small brown '''Gravel Unloading''' bin designed to sit under a length of single track that had a small oblong opening and a flat [[billboard]] at the end, where a single green 'Gravel' sticker was applied facing the track. The rear side was heavily reinforced by two half round molded pillars. As the gravel trailer was reversed into this, a raised portion of the roadway engaged with and opened the shutter underneath the trailer, causing the gravel to fall through the opening and into the bin.\n\nThis special track was later modified, gaining a box with raised sides around the opening, presumably to prevent spillages. Meanwhile, two long slots were also added on the sides to enable it to lock over the front of the gravel hopper to form the '''Elevated Gravel Unloader''' (see below). At the same time the billboard at the end was made double sided, by removing the reinforcing ribs at the rear, so that it could now take a green and white 'Gravel' sticker on each face.\n\nThe brown gravel bin was originally supplied with a tan-painted floor, discontinuing that was probably an early cost-cutting measure.\n\nTo fill the gravel trailer, there was an orange '''Operating Overhead Gravel Hopper''' that stood on a gantry over another type of single-road section (this was also used under the '''Barrel Loader'''). As the gravel trailer was reversed under the hopper it opened a shutter and was filled with gravel, ready to be driven away. This hopper was supplied with a small billboard type 'Gravel' sign that attached to the front of the hopper by two prongs. These are quite vulnerable and today are nearly always found broken. Adhesive putty can be used to mount billboards with broken prongs on the frame of the orange hopper. This is where it was often shown on the set box illustrations - (See Tyco Truck Resource link below).\n\nThe same hopper could be used as part of the '''Elevated Gravel Unloader''' which consisted of a set of '''Elevated Piers''' and a later version of the section of track supplied with the '''Gravel Unloading''' bin. This time that unloading track was intended to be positioned above the hopper, making it possible to fill your gravel trailer, drive around the circuit and then put that same gravel back in the same hopper ready to do it all again! The included instruction sheet shows a track diagram of how to arrange the track to achieve this and details where to position all six graduated height Elevated Piers.\n\nThe '''Gravel Supply Terminal''' was a 'dock' where a gravel trailer could park. There was a small brown building with a black roof at the far end.  Although there was no loading or unloading here, a neat little mechanism allowed the Semi-Tractor to reverse in and automatically hitch or un-hitch the trailer as required.\n\nThe same dock molding was used for the '''Freight Terminal''' where one of the Box Trailers could be parked, which worked in the same way. This had an even smaller yellow hut with a gray roof at the far end. Usually the gravel terminal mechanism has fewer moving parts than that in the freight terminal, but on early examples the mechanisms were identical.\n\nOriginal US-1 gravel was made of small plastic pellets and was supplied in a sealed clear plastic packet, but is often lost. [[Mung bean|Mung Beans]] look similar and make a perfect replacement.\n\n'''Crates''' \u2013 These are sturdy looking objects which were set out on a gray platform outside a cream shed. This was the '''Crate Loader'''. As the flat trailer was reversed in, it pushed the platform back into the shed and the crates went onto the trailer.\n\nThe '''Crate Unloader''' is a light gray platform at one side of a single track with a small yard on the other. Access was through a tall dark gray hoop from which a hinged flap is hanging. The ominous yellow and black hatchings and the words \u2018Unload Here\u2019 are a clue to what happens \u2013 the trailer loaded with crates is reversed under the flap, which hinges open away from the main road, allowing the trailer and crates to pass beneath, but as the trailer is withdrawn, the flap locks vertical and rigid, then brutally tears the crates from the trailer onto the floor, irrespective of any \u2018Fragile\u2019, \u2018Handle With Care\u2019 or \u2018This Way Up\u2019 stickers that might be applied to them.\n\nIn the Army Transport set this Action Accessory became an '''Ammunition Dump''' with different stickers and the crates were a darker brown. Replica crates have been produced but were not widely available. If originals or replicas are unavailable, a 1\" Wooden Cube suffices. \n\n'''Car Loader''' \u2013 Similar in principle to the crate loader, a double-deck red hollow \u2018cartridge\u2019 is loaded up with the four brightly colored automobiles \u2013 two on each level. The yellow [[Car carrier trailer|car trailer]] reverses against the cartridge, moving it back against a tall red stop block. This causes the four cars to roll forward and fill the two decks of the trailer. The '''Car Unloader''' is a long roadway with an orange gantry leading to two ramps. As the Auto Transporter trailer reverses in, it engages with the gantry, causing the decks to rise up at the cab end, encouraging the cars to roll out of the trailer, onto the ramps and finally come to a rest, spread out on the black cardboard [[Parking Lot]] that is part of this item.\n\n'''Logs''' - These were brown-stained 9mm-diameter wood [[dowel]]s 1.5\u201d long and could be loaded into the dump truck by the '''Log Loader/Elevated Log Loader''', which held the loading device high on an orange girder gantry. It is designed to sit under a high-level roadway, so the loading rig is alongside. The actual loading part consisted of a sloping tray in which the logs are laid. This has a lever that is activated by the tipper truck reversing alongside. This released some of the logs into the truck. The loading portion could be removed from the girder base and clipped alongside track at ground level if desired. The actuating lever is quite fragile and many found today are broken. The lever tends to strike most larger passing vehicles when the loader is clipped in place.\n\n'''Operating Log-Loading Bulldozer''' - is a mechanical accessory of the type for which Tyco were famous. The bulldozer is activated by the motor of the truck that is being loaded. This is [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmitted]] to the mechanism by rollers. Once the truck was reversed in, it rested against a stop block. The power is kept on, causing the [[bulldozer]] to push the logs up a gentle slope and into the body of the truck. There is a driver wearing a blue uniform who sat in the controls of the bulldozer. He is prone to breakage or being lost, as are the exhaust pipes. Once the logs have been loaded and the truck has left, the bulldozer needs resetting by hand and the stock of logs, replenishing. Logs are often missing but dowelling of a suitable thickness (8mm-diameter adequately substitutes the original 9mm size) can be cut to length and stained in a commercial wood stain, or even tea or coffee, to look much the same as the originals.\n\n'''Boulders''' - There is an identical '''Boulder Loading Bulldozer''' which came with some boulders (these are actual small stones not imitations) instead of logs. This is much less common than the log-loading version and seems to have been introduced later. Today suitable replacement stones can be obtained from hobby stores. Tumbled and glazed ones reduce friction and avoid scuffing the surface of the accessory.\n\n'''Pipes''' - The '''Operating Crane Pipe Loader''' was another mechanically activated accessory borrowed from Tyco model railroads. The drive was the same as the bulldozer but activated a crane with a rigid wire hook in the shape of an 'L' to move in a back and forth, up and down movement. As it moved, it scooped up a pipe and deposited it in the rear of the waiting truck which supplied the power. It continued in the same movement while the power was applied. The pipes were 14mm-diameter wide white plastic tubular moulding, in 10mm lengths. These were held on edge in a narrow sloping trough, molded into the base, presenting their open side ready for the crane to engage. As one was taken, the next rolled into place ready for the crane to swing back. The crane did not need any manual intervention, other than more pipes being added when they ran out. Pipes, like logs and gravel are often missing but 15mm-diameter plastic water pipe cut into 10mm lengths makes a perfect substitute.\n\n'''Barrels''' - These are 13mm-diameter, 19mm long and have one end sealed. They are usually molded in off white plastic, but were dark butter yellow in the Army Transport set (with wrap around yellow 'Diesel' stickers) and white in the Stomper Set. The same barrel-molding was used as a load for a brown slat-sided semi-trailer in the TYCO TCR series, although in a luminous yellow plastic.\n\nThese were held in the '''Barrel Loader''' - a brown sloping rack mounted on a yellow girder frame. As the tipper truck reversed, it engaged with a lever that released some barrels, which rolled from the rack into the truck. A version with a blue sloping rack and the same yellow frame was shown in publicity material and on the carton of the Motor City set. All examples found have the same brown loader as all the others, but with '''Motor City Oil Co.''' stickers with blue writing on a white background. As yet, no substitute barrels have been found, but a 19mm-long, suitable-diameter pipe or dowel would probably suffice.\n\n'''Unloading Yards''' - There were two varieties, the more common '''Pipe and Log Unloading Yard''', which had a grey base and brown walls. This was sold separately, as well as being in most in most sets, and also appeared with blue walls in the 3209 Motor City Set. The blue unloading yard is labeled with Goodyear stickers and according to catalog illustrations was intended to receive tires, although a way of loading them was not devised. In the Army Transport Set, the standard brown-walled Unloading Yard became an '''Army Dump''' with different stickers.\n\nThe second smaller Unloading Yard arrived later and is much harder to find. It is on a 9\" 45 degree double turnout supplied in the 3213 Highways Wrecker Set and 3219 Night Haulers Set. Originally this track was just a double turnout, but a small unloading yard with brown walls was added on one side of the junction and most of these sections that are found have this.\n\nThe Unloading Yards worked by the lip at the entrance of the yard engaging with the 'steps' or 'mud flaps' on the rear of the reversing tipper's bucket. This causes it to rise, the tailgate to open and the goods to slide out into the yard. Logs, pipes, barrels, tires and presumably boulders could all be deposited in the unloading yards but not gravel, simply because the rear of the tipper was too large to go under the hopper.\n\n'''Airport''' - This mechanical accessory lacks any loading or unloading function. The rollers transmit the drive from the vehicle to the orange [[radar]] dish on a white cap, which rotates atop the terminal building. Attached to the inside of the cap is a long, rigid wire. On the far end of this is a small plastic plane. As the radar revolves in an [[Clockwise|anti-clockwise]] direction, the plane circulates the tower, soaring up and coming back down, over and over again, almost landing and then taking off. There is a cardboard mat supplied for the building to stand on which includes a short section of [[Runway|runway]].\n\nThis is popular at shows, causing gasps and wows as the plane appears to fly. There are two planes provided and they are both rather small for the scale of the trucks and the buildings. One of them is in [[FedEx]] livery, so a good vehicle to use with this would be the FedEx delivery van or the Airport Taxi, whilst the Semi-Tractor shown on the box looks rather out of place.\n\nThe radar dish is fragile and often broken or missing. The walls are blue and the windows lined in white with the word 'Airport' on the blue roof in big white letters. This was mainly sold as a separate item but appeared in one set (in this form), the 3225 Coast to Coast Set.\n\nThe Airport appeared again with brown walls and a gray roof, as the '''Forest Rescue''' centre in the very rare 3211 Stomper Set. This time the radar and cap were moulded in butter yellow and the plane has simpler decoration to allow for the application of the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] stickers and Forest Rescue markings.\n\n'''G. I. Joe Satellite Launcher''' - This consisted of a two-piece sculpted concrete effect [[launch pad]] area with a straight approach track at the centre of one side. The base unit for the pad was clearly derived from the 3440 Unloading Yard.\n\nThe pivoting launching [[Gantry (rocketry)|gantry]] folds down horizontally, in line with the roadway, in order to engage with a [[missile]] loaded on a flatbed trailer as it is reversed towards it. In this position the launch gantry engages with the hollow missile and as the trailer backs further the gantry pivots to bring the missile to the upright position.\n\nMissiles are normally white with a gray cap but a few rare examples are known to have red caps. The gantry is a very delicate white plastic molding and many found today have broken pivot arms. This accessory was exclusive to the GI Joe set and was never available separately.\n\n'''Garage Type Buildings''' - This basic structure appeared in different colours, with different signs to serve as three differently purposed buildings, all with road access:\n\n1/ '''Highway Wrecker Set with Lighted Wrecker, Tow Car & Garage''' - The building was yellow with an orange roof and petrol pump. There also a special piece of single straight track with switch that allowed the towed car, the White Firebird, to be unhitched as it was reversed in to the opening.\n\n2/ '''Fire Station with Switch Track & Storage Yard''' - was a red version of the building with a black roof. This came off a different track section that formed a tuning-fork shape. The Fire station stood over the right lane, whilst the left lane was open. As a vehicle drove in to one lane, the turnout automatically switched to the other, isolating the first vehicle. There was a representation of a [[Siren (alarm)|siren]] on the roof of this building, which looks a bit like chimney.\n\n3/ '''Garage with Switch Track & Truck Stop''' - This was similar to the fire station, but had white walls, a blue roof, red windows, etc. It had the same track section as the fire station and operated in the same way. There was no siren or petrol pump.\n\n'''Flashing Danger Track''' - came with a '''15\" Straight Squeeze Track''' where one lane moved towards the other to avoid a hazard. This made it impossible for two vehicles to pass simultaneously. There is a red beacon with a flashing yellow light that sits at the side of the road warning oncoming vehicles. This accessory needed two AA batteries.\n\n'''3673 Overhead Interstate Highway Signs''' were sold in packs. These contained six gray over-road lattice gantries that each had two blank sign panels and sheets of different stickers to apply to them. They were also supplied in every US-1 set, including the Stomper Set with some special labels, including one for a Stomper Garage.\n\nMost of the stickers provided relate to the various action stations: Log Loader 3 Miles Ahead, Dump Site, Motor City Car Lot, Freight Terminal, Gravel Terminal, Gravel Hopper, Oil Refinery, etc. (There was never an Oil Refinery Action Station). The stickers have a tendency to dry out and fall off over time and the gantries themselves are delicate and prone to breakage, deformation and yellowing.\n\nThe earlier gantries have a clearance height of 60mm from the ground and have 35mm long flat feet on either side intended to be tucked under the track. These are not very effective at standing up and are too low for the loaded car transporter to pass beneath.\n\nThe later type of gantries have a 70mm clearance from the ground and the feet are only 25mm long, but each has a wedge shape projecting against the side of the track. The newer design clips positively against the track and usually remains there.\n\nIn place, the gantries are scenic, but tend to obstruct the cleaning of contact rails or attending to a vehicle.\n\n'''3768 Overhead Highway Light''' is a neat little gray streetlamp, set on a huge base that housed an AA battery and was operated by a switch. The bulb is a Grain of Wheat type mounted in the head with a reflector behind. These are surprisingly effective when they work, but they often don't, due to failed bulbs, broken switches and corrosion from leaky batteries.\n\nAlthough never sold separately, the light gray '''US-1 Elevated Piers''' appeared in four of the trucking sets and were a key part of the '''3453 Elevated Gravel Unloader'''. A set of piers included two of each. Pier 1 is 19mm high, number 2 is 38mm and pier 3 reached a height of 57mm. In the top of each pier was a 11mm-diameter round hole that engaged with the corresponding round lugs on the underside of most lengths of US-1 Track.\n\nBesides the piers, elevated items in the US-1 series included the '''Elevated Gravel Unloader''' which required the track to be at 73mm from the base and the '''Elevated Log Loader''' which needed it to be at 76mm high. The US-1 piers are the same as those sold to use with Tyco Quick Clik racing track although these were often cream instead of light gray. The shape of the pillars (a gently tapered series of progressively smaller concentric oblongs), goes back to the Tyco Pro series of track, although the top fixings of those were not compatible with US-1 or Quick Clik.\n\n'''Working Height:''' Although sold for potential use with an HO-scale model railroad, the US-1 elevated track has a clearance of 57mm provided by the high level piers, which is insufficient to clear a train running below. This is made worse if a 'roadbed' type model railroad track is used, where the track sits on some imitation ballast, raising the height of the rails by several mm.\n\n57mm is also too low to allow a loaded car transporter pass underneath. However, as the elevated piers are hollow, it is possible to stack them upon each other, to give the extra height required, provided enough can be found.\n\nIt is still possible to get packs of brand new unused (old stock) Tyco piers from at least one supplier on the Internet. One layout that can be seen on a video app has a high level circuit supported by 87mm high pillars which have been created from 3 of the middle rise piers firmly stacked together. This height is enough to clear an HO Railroad on a roadbed type track, as well as any US-1 road circuit running a loaded car transporter.\n\nThere were also three [[Plastic model|Plastic Construction Kits]]: a '''[[Mobil Oil|Mobil Truck Station]]''', a '''[[Howard Johnson's|Howard Johnson's Truck Stop]]''', and a '''P.I.E. Freight Terminal''', each molded in several colors to be glued together. These were supplied by Pola, in what was then [[West Germany]] and were also sold for a time as part of the Tyco model railroad range, but in plain Tyco 'Brown Box' packaging and with slightly different names and in some cases different colourings or markings. The Truck station and Freight Terminal kits have appeared in other ranges over the years and are still available, but now as part of the [[Wm. K. Walthers|Walther's]] Trainline range and with different colourings and markings.\n\n=== Sets ===\nMost US-1 pieces came together in a series of sets, based on certain duties a truck would need to do. Numerous sets came out between 1981 and 1986, each with varied action accessories as described above. Some sets were themed, such as the 3235 Road & Rail set, with a complete railroad and two of the 3727 grade crossings, or the 3217 G.I. Joe High Adventure Set, based around soldiers and their equipment.\n\nThe vehicles supplied in the sets were however only a small selection of those available: The Peterbilt tipper appeared in most sets (except the G.I. Joe, Highway Wrecker and Stomper Sets) - Usually in the standard lime green, but was olive green especially for the army transport set and is believed to have been red in the rare Empire Set\n\nThe Peterbilt Semi-tractor was also included in most sets, (except Army Transport, Fire Alert and Stomper sets) the colors being red with white stripes or yellow with orange and black stripes (both are consequently common colors for this vehicle). It was in Army Green in the GI Joe set.\n\nThe Kenworth Semi-tractor was only sold in two sets - appearing in blue with stripes in the Fire Alert set, whilst the olive version was exclusive to the Army Transport set. In the Night Haulers set the Green tipper and the Red Peterbilt semi-tractor were both lighted versions\n\nOther vehicles featuring in sets are the Fire Truck, Wrecker, Dummy Firebird, Stomper Blazer, Stomper Pick Up and the Cobra Troop carrier which was only available in the G.I. Joe set\n\nThe G.I. Joe set also came with soldiers, tanks, jeeps, a helicopter, a boat, a bridge, paratroopers, a die-cut Secret Cobra Command Headquarters, a full-color G.I. Joe Action Battle Mat (with Mountain Backdrop) and a unique '''Satellite Launching Pad with Gantry''' Action Accessory.\n\nArguably, one of the rarest and most expensive sets has a [[Schaper Toys|Schaper]] Stompers theme. Only produced in 1985, complete examples are very rare. It contains a special version of the Airport in brown (3434), unique this set. A die-cut cardboard building can be folded to make a garage for the cars. The set sits on a Stompers-themed playmat, with a portion of the track supported by Elevated Piers.\n\nAnother rare set is the 3213 Highway Wrecker Set, released in 1984. This set contains a gravel loader, gravel unloader, garage, double turnout, special straight with [[Telephone booth|phone booth]], billboard sign. The phone booth straight and [[billboard]] sign were only available in this set and are extremely difficult to procure.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Set Ref.\n!1981\n!1982\n!1983\n!1984\n!1985\n!1986\n|-\n|3201\n|Big City Trucking\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n|3202\n!\n|City Hauler Starter\n!\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n|3203\n!\n!\n|Big Hauler\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n|3204\n!\n!\n|Army Transport\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n|3205\n|Cross Country Trucking\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n|3206\n!\n|Interstate Delivery\n!\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n|3208\n!\n!\n|Interstate Delivery\n|Interstate Delivery\n|Interstate Delivery\n|Interstate Delivery\n|-\n|3209\n!\n!\n|Motor City\n|Motor City\n|Motor City\n|Motor City\n|-\n|3210\n|Interstate Trucking\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n|3211\n!\n!\n!\n!\n|Stomper\nHigh Adventure\n!\n|-\n|3212\n!\n|Highway Construction\n!\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n|3213\n!\n!\n!\n|Highway Wrecker\n!\n!\n|-\n|3215\n|Long Haul Trucker\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n|3216\n!\n|Highway Overpass\n!\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n|3217\n!\n!\n!\n|G.I.

This is usually because most sections of US-1 track were just a gray variant of the Quick Clik black racing track. Some items can be found with a racing and US-1 reference underneath - the Squeeze track and the Lane changer for example, but even then the number molded is usually a part number rather than a catalogue number. For example the bespoke 9\" Junction carries the reference 3016 beneath but was listed as 3700. Most separate track appears to have been sold in pairs in carded blister packs except the 9\" junction and the railroad crossing which were individually sold in blister packs and the squeeze track which was sold with the flashing beacon in an illustrated box.\n\nWe have listed the special and rare 'set only' items of track in the table above by their molded numbers, to help identify them.\n\nThere were several different '''Assortment Packs''' advertised in the annual catalogs. These contained substantial quantities of track, and other items such as Street Lamps or Overhead Signs. The contents and reference numbers changed over time, but the packs always appeared to contain three transformers and three controllers, which seems rather odd. It is not known how these were packaged and they were never shown on retail price lists, so they may well have been aimed at dealers.\n\nBoulder Loading Bulldozer*  - Two reference numbers have come to light for this item: 3414 is shown on literature enclosed with the accessory, whilst 3470 appears in the 1984 and 1985 Tyco catalogs. Both are shown above. Anyone with access to a box for this please feel free to update!\n\n\n== TYCO US-1 Catalogues and literature  or  \"It Ain't Necessarily So\" ==\nThe US-1 range first appeared in the joint Tyco racing and model railroad catalogue in 1981 and was then shown every year until 1986. It featured in a number of other promotional leaflets too, as well as magazine adverts etc.\n\nOne big issue for the collector is the accuracy of how the range was represented in some of those illustrations and also the images on the various set and accessory boxes. The set boxes also carried large artist's renderings of other makes and types of trucks and trailers that didn't appear in the range. How things were illustrated was not necessarily how they actually appeared when sold.\n\nThe first example of this is the track with yellow centre lines. This was produced only briefy, but was still being illustrated in catalogues several years later. Some of the images of the assembled set contents showed yellow lines throughout their time in the range.\n\nThe second issue is of prototype or pre-production models being shown instead of the final version. This is particularly true of the crate unloader, gravel hopper, gravel bin and pipe loading crane illustrations. Some of which are clearly not the versions actually produced, all differing in several details.\n\nThe third example is the type of trucks shown in the various set content illustrations. If you see the section on lighted vehicles you will see that these were only supplied in one set. There were also clear differences between lighted vehicles and those without lights, most noticeably the two rectangular headlights either side of the griile grill were open instead of solid, with a clear plastic lens inside.\n\nIf you study various set illustrations you will see that many of the vehicles shown accompanying some of the sets are actually lighted ones, even though these were not supplied in that particular set. Conversely it appears that early some lighted trucks were listed without them actually being identified as such. The lighted Semi-Tractor in Yellow with orange and black stripes appears to be one example of this.\n\nFinally, a few items are shown in a color finish the actual items never carried. For example the top section of the motor city barrel loader is shown as being blue, but was in reality just the normal brown version with Motor City Stickers. The US-1 Police car was a two door Dodge Charger but at least once it was shown as a four door Plymouth Satellite with a large blower.\n\nSo even though Tyco may have illustrated it, does not mean that you can find it!\n\n==Body Shells - Before, After & Outside of US-1 ==\nThe Peterbilt Semi-Tractor had preceded the US-1 range, being introduced in 1979 on the lighted HP2 racing chassis and a slotless, lighted Command Control chassis. The latter was black with flames and no hole in the fifth wheel - or sometimes a hole, which was too small for the later trailers.\n\nCommand Control was Tyco\u2019s first attempt at slotless racing and a direct competitor to the original [[Ideal Toy Company|Ideal]] [[Total Control Racing]] or TCR. The same body was later used again in the Tyco version of the Slotless TCR system produced from 1991 to 1993\n\nBoth the Peterbilt and Kenworth Semi-tractor moldings were used in racing form, with a chromed plastic fifth wheel, which was initially attached by a rivet and two melted-over plastic side pegs to the platform behind the driver\u2019s cab. On later Peterbilts the rivet was deleted and the side pegs were considered enough, although the rivet hole remained. \n\nTwo versions of the Kenworth 'Cab over' Semis were available in racing form between 1983 and 1985 with HP7 chassis. One is mainly black with a red stripe that has white edges and the other mainly white with blue patches and orange stripes. \n\nMost of the racing and Slotless Semi-tractor bodies can be easily adapted to fit a US-1 chassis by drilling out the hollow rivet and pegs that hold the chromed plastic fifth wheel in place. Any vehicle so modified will have three evenly spaced tell-tale holes visible on the platform just behind the cab. On some early examples of the Peterbilt Semi-Tractor this rear platform is lower and consequently these bodies will not fit a US-1 chassis without further work.\n\nThe Peterbilt Semi bodies that won't fit on a US-1 chassis can be identified by their colors: Baby Blue with Black Stripes or White with Red Stripes. Also some in Yellow with fine Orange and Red Stripes or Black with Flames used the original version of the body as well as the later version that will fit. Some of these had gray grills and exhausts instead of Chrome.\n\nOf the many US-1 trailers, only the box type made it into the racing series, appearing in various color schemes. The later had a redesigned reversible bogie with a slot-guide plus a bar magnet to encourage it to stay on the track, although some are known to carry the US-1-type bogie. At the front end, these box trailers kept their US-1 style pivot, allowing them to be run with US-1 Semi-Tractors.\n\nThe Dodge Van can be found in various liveries in racing form and also in Tyco TCR form as the Blue and White \u2018Emergency\u2019 Jam Car. This featured the red light-bar that had been used on the US-1 Mack Fire Truck.\n\nPolice Cars: There is a US-1 publicity photo showing a four-door [[Plymouth Satellite]] in use as the US-1 Police Car: with roof lights, a large hood mounted blower and side pipes, but this was never released as part of the US-1 range. (See the Tyco Resource in the '''External Links''' section Below - Vehicles page)\n\nThe US-1 \u2018911\u2019 police car and Airport Taxi were based on the two-door [[Dodge Charger]] that had been introduced to the Tyco range back in 1977. This was done without \u2018door-netting\u2019 on the glazing and the body was modified to take the roof lights for the police car. The Charger remained in the Tyco racing range until 2005.\n\nOther US-1 vehicles that can be found with a racing chassis are the Jeep in civilian colors which was available from 1980 to 1983 and the Black and Gold Firebird which was sold from 1979 to 1983 but was to eventually reappear in 2005 and 2006 in two special sets.\n\nThere are eight non-US-1 versions of the Stomper Blazer, five of which were equipped with lights, that the US-1 version never carried. One was sold as part of the Faller AMS series. The three 'flame paint' versions had no lights\n\nThe Mack Fire Truck was also sold as part of the Faller AMS range, both individually (cat no. 5631) and in the 'Feuer Alarm' set (Cat no. 3907), which also contained a lighted blue and white racing version of the Pontiac Firebird. These were both introduced in 1983 and the truck was catalogued for at least two years. From two examples seen, it would appear to be the standard US-1 offering, with the same chassis, mechanical bell, lights and American markings. Even the molded 'Tyco H.K.'markings were underneath.\n\nUnusually, at this late stage, Faller AMS had extensive links to Aurora AFX. The Fire Truck appeared in the Faller range alongside some of the same Semi-Tractors and trailers which were also sold as part of the Aurora 'Big Ryder' series, (which was their answer to Tyco US-1), as well as other Tyco offerings.\n\n== Spare Parts, Running and Collecting ==\n'''Spare parts:''' Some parts, such as pick-ups, were originally available from the manufacturers, but today these are hard to find. Luckily a number of people have begun producing parts to keep US-1 vehicles running. Tires which fit all the standard vehicles are available from a number of vendors. Specially stamped and shaped replacement pick-ups can be obtained too, which fit all the vehicles in the series, (including the Stompers). Recently, batches of light bars for the wrecker and fire engine have been made, along with the unique tires for the Stomper and some US-1-type metal guide pins. Their availability can be seen on the Internet.\n\n'''Motor''': The motor used throughout US-1 was a standard [[Mabuchi Motor|Mabuchi]] item and can also be found fitted to other vehicles, including 'Ideal' Slot Cars, later some slotless Tyco TCR 'Jam Cars'. [[New old stock]] spares can sometimes be found and many similar, but not identical motors were made. When checking a Mabuchi motor to see if it will be a suitable replacement, the available length of the shaft to take the worm gear and the position of the contacts (which is on the side of US-1 motors) need to be considered.\n\n'''Customised items and Replicas:''' One vendor specialises in making double 90 degree turnouts out of two single ones, along with 9\" and 6\" single straights. All very handy when maximising layout space. Vendors offering trucks, trailers, loads and Action Accessories in custom finishes, such as FedEx, can often be found on a well known Internet auction site\n\n'''Running suggestions:''' To run US-1 (and not use the original control gear), wires can be carefully soldered to the underside of the two contact strips, but given the age and condition of the track, it is recommended that as the layout size increases, the number of 'feeds' to each circuit are increased to avoid voltage drop. US-1 track has not always aged well and much found will have discolored or had minor bits broken off at the joints. To obtain the best running results, use the best track available and clean it well: Wash and scrub with a good detergent and then dry it thoroughly. Give the contact strips a rub with an abrasive track-cleaning block, (like those used for model railroads) and pay particular attention to the areas where the metal contact strips join. Treatment of the metal strips with a non-damaging contact oil can be helpful, but try to avoid getting any on the road surface.\n\n'''Integration with Other Makes:''' US-1 vehicles will run on most other makes of HO slot car track, but the Action Accessories can only be connected to Tyco US-1 track via the special US-1 turnouts. US-1 track is a gray version of Tyco Quick Clik and this is compatible with the later Mattel track.  Adaptor sections to join Quick Clik to the older Tyco Pro and Life-Like Racing tracks have been made, but only the [[Round 2 (company)|Auto World]] 'Tyco Quick Clik to Tomy AFX' type appears to still be in production.\n\nVehicles from this range are relatively wide, so if two trucks are simultaneously run on an earlier, narrower slot-car track, like Playcraft Highways or [[Aurora Plastics Corporation|Aurora Model Motoring]], they will collide.\n\nNon US-1 vehicles can be run on Trucking layouts, but lighter types like Aurora [[Pancake (slot car)|TJets]] will get 'beached' on the sprung copper tongues at the junctions, wheras Magnetic slot cars will generally cope quite well as they usually have enough 'virtual' weight to pass through them.\n\n'''Control Gear:''' In the experience of this contributor, (from running various makes of model electric roadways for around 35 years), the best type of controller to use is a Model Railroad 'feedback' type. These give good speed control and steady constant speed running, (resistance types of many makes have been tried but can cause erratic running). Videos exist showing the trucks being successfully run with Model Railroad [[Digital Command Control]] 'electronic chips' fitted. This is not for the faint-hearted and can also be expensive.\n\n'''Servicing:''' Any vehicle obtained will need a good clean, and the tunnel weight temporarily removed by prising the side with a small flat screwdriver. This allows removal of fluff, which accumulates around the worm screw and rear axle. Lightly oil the motor bearings, axles and gears, replace the tires if they are hardened and the pick ups, too, if they are 'rutted'.\n\n'''Fitting Replacement Pick Ups:''' Do not pre-bend them, the cast plate that holds them into the chassis will automatically set them to correct angle as they are screwed into place. (Pre-bending them can exert to much force on the roadway, resulting in lost traction). However it is important to ensure that the folded 'retaining brackets' at the ends of the strips are free to travel up and down in their open mountings. On the Semi-Tractors ensure that the 'return' portion of these brackets does not rub against the Fifth Wheel weight, or it will stop it moving freely and may cause a short circuit.\n\n'''Videos:''' Although today models and sets are bought by collectors, many US-1 trucks are operated either at home or at public shows. Videos showing this can be found on some video apps. Some of the films show the various loading and unloading accessories in action and original commercials for the range can be found, too: Search for 'Tyco Trucking' or 'Tyco US-1'.\n\n==External links==\nUS-1 Trucking Resource [http://tycotrain.tripod.com/tycous1trucking/]\n\nDerek A Brand - Tribute Page = [http://www.daveshobby.net/derek-brand-tribute.html]\n\nHistory of HO Slot Car racing [http://www.hoslotcarracing.com/History.html]\n\nTyco Catalogs (Year by year, page by page) [https://www.hoseeker.org/tyco.htm]\n\n==See also==\n* [[U.S. 1 (comics)]], a [[Marvel Comics]] series licensed from this toyline, set in the [[Marvel Universe]].\n\n[[Category:Toy cars and trucks]]\n\n\n{{Toy-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Highwayman97", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eTYCO US-1 Catalogues and literature  or  \"It Ain't Necessarily So\":tidy", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US-1_Trucks"}

Is it permissible to give a mother in extreme illness medicine to expel a fetus?  Reply. Firstly, it is certain that it is not permissible for a mother outside of danger of death to take medicine for expelling even an inanimate fetus, since directly impeding the life of a human being is a grave sin, and a still graver one if the fetus is animate. It is certain, secondly, that it is not permissible for a mother even in danger of death to take medicine for expelling an ensouled fetus directly, since this would be procuring the child's death directly. The question is rather whether it is permissible for a mother to take a medicine absolutely necessary to save her life when it involves danger of expulsion of the fetus. The reply is that, if the fetus is inanimate, the mother may certainly ensure her life, even though, unintentionally on her part, expulsion of the fetus results, an expulsion for which the mother is not responsible, since she is only using her natural right to preserve her life.

The Catholic Health Association of the United States, which issues guidelines for Catholic hospitals and health systems there, allows both procedures to be used. The argument that these methods amount to an indirect abortion revolves around the idea that the removal of the Fallopian tube or, in the case of methotrexate, the chemical destruction of the trophoblastic cells (those which go on to form the placenta), does not constitute a direct act upon the developing embryo. Individual hospitals and physicians, however, may choose to prohibit these procedures if they personally interpret these acts as a direct abortion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncbcenter.org/page.aspx?pid=940 |title=The National Catholic Bioethics Center \u2013 When Pregnancy Goes Awry |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613072915/http://www.ncbcenter.org/Page.aspx?pid=940 |archive-date=2013-06-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chausa.org/publications/health-progress/article/may-june-2014/early-pregnancy-complications-and-the-ethical-and-religious-directives|title=Early Pregnancy Complications and the Ethical and Religious Directives|website=www.chausa.org|access-date=2016-04-20}}</ref> Despite the lack of an official pronouncement by the Church on these treatments, in a 2012 survey of 1,800 Ob/Gyns who work in religious hospitals, only 2.9% of respondents reported feeling constrained in their treatment options by their employers, suggesting that in practice, physicians and healthcare institutions generally choose to treat ectopic pregnancies.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stulberg|first=Debra B.|last2=Dude|first2=Annie M.|last3=Dahlquist|first3=Irma|last4=Curlin|first4=Farr A.|date=2012-07-01|title=Obstetrician-gynecologists, religious institutions, and conflicts regarding patient-care policies|url= |journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|volume=207|issue=1|pages=73.e1\u201373.e5|doi=10.1016/j.ajog.2012.04.023|pmc=3383370|pmid=22609017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2012/05/08/152249843/when-religious-rules-and-womens-health-collide|title=When Religious Rules And Women's Health Collide|website=NPR.org|access-date=2016-04-20}}</ref>\n\n===Embryos===\n{{See also|Stem cell controversy}}\nThe Church considers the destruction of any embryo to be equivalent to abortion, and thus opposes [[embryonic stem cell research]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/about/pro-life-activities/respect-life-program/upload/On-Embryonic-Stem-Cell-Research.pdf|title=USCCB on embryonic stem cell research|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=July 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Sanctions===\nCatholics who procure a completed abortion are subject to a ''[[latae sententiae]]'' [[excommunication]].<ref name=\"Canon\"/> That means that the excommunication is not imposed by an authority or trial (as with a ''ferendae sententiae'' penalty); rather, being expressly established by [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]], it is incurred ''[[ipso facto]]'' when the delict is committed (a ''latae sententiae'' penalty).<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P4V.HTM#2G Code of Canon Law, canon 1314]</ref> Canon law states that in certain circumstances \"the accused is not bound by a ''latae sententiae'' penalty\"; among the ten circumstances listed are commission of a delict by someone not yet sixteen years old, or by someone who without [[negligence]] does not know of the existence of the penalty, or by someone \"who was coerced by grave fear, even if only relatively grave, or due to necessity or grave inconvenience.\"<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P4W.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1324] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224152526/https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P4W.HTM |date=December 24, 2007 }}</ref><ref>See also commentaries on the Code of Canon Law such as E.

Is it permissible to give a mother in extreme illness medicine to expel a fetus?  Reply. Firstly, it is certain that it is not permissible for a mother outside of danger of death to take medicine for expelling even an inanimate fetus, since directly impeding the life of a human being is a grave sin, and a still graver one if the fetus is animate. It is certain, secondly, that it is not permissible for a mother even in danger of death to take medicine for expelling an ensouled fetus directly, since this would be procuring the child's death directly. The question is rather whether it is permissible for a mother to take a medicine absolutely necessary to save her life when it involves danger of expulsion of the fetus. The reply is that, if the fetus is inanimate, the mother may certainly ensure her life, even though, unintentionally on her part, expulsion of the fetus results, an expulsion for which the mother is not responsible, since she is only using her natural right to preserve her life. If the fetus is animate, it is generally held that a mother may take a medicine whose direct purpose is to save her life when nothing else will save it; but it is different in the case of medicines that of themselves are directed to killing a fetus, which it is never permissible to take\" ([https://books.google.com/books?id=gN_dFQwcwSAC&pg=PA247#v=onepage&q&f=false Alphonsus Maria de Ligorio, ''Theologia Moralis'' (Bassano 1831), vol. 1, pp. 247-248);] cf.

In these cases, the intended effect is to save the woman's life, not to terminate the pregnancy, and the death of the embryo or fetus is a side effect. The death of the fetus is an undesirable but unavoidable consequence.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | title = Doctrine of Double Effect | url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/double-effect/ | editor = Edward N.

The Catholic Health Association of the United States, which issues guidelines for Catholic hospitals and health systems there, allows both procedures to be used. The argument that these methods amount to an indirect abortion revolves around the idea that the removal of the Fallopian tube or, in the case of methotrexate, the chemical destruction of the trophoblastic cells (those which go on to form the placenta), does not constitute a direct act upon the developing embryo.

While it considers that Catholics should not favour direct abortion in any field, according to Frank K.

It is a work of sharp social [[satire]], documenting the lives of [[Birmingham]] factory workers in the [[interwar]] boom years. It is considered a modern classic by scholars, and appears on many university syllabi. The language is notable for its deliberate lack of [[Conjunction (grammar)|conjunctive]]s to reflect a Birmingham accent. As well, very few [[Article (grammar)|articles]] are used, allegedly to mimic foreign languages (such as Arabic) that use them infrequently. It is considered a work of [[Modernist literature]].\n\nThe novel has been acclaimed for making Green \"an honorary member of a literary movement to which he never belonged\",<ref name=\"Ortega\">\"The Language of the Working-Class Novel\" by Ramon Lopez Ortega, in Gustav Klaus, H. (Ed.) ''The Socialist Novel in Britain'', Brighton:Harvester Press, 1982, p123-4</ref> i.e. the genre of [[proletarian literature]]. Despite his class origin and politics, the novel has been acclaimed as \"closer to the world of the [[working class]] than those of some [[socialism|socialist]] or worker-writers themselves\".<ref name =\"Ortega\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n''Living'' tells the story of several iron foundry workers in the West Midlands city of Birmingham, England in the 1920s.  It also follows, though in much less detail, the lives of the foundry's owners and, in particular, their social living.  The key narrative progressions centre on Lily Gates, the novel's female protagonist, and her courting with Bert Jones, one of the factory workers.  They seek an opportunity to escape the British working-class existence by travelling abroad.  Crucial to their attempted elopement is Lily's desire to work.  She is constantly stifled in this venture by the man she calls 'Grandad', Craigan, who is her father's best friend and with whom she lives.  Craigan tells Lily that ' \"[n]one o' the womanfolk go to work from the house I inhabit' \".<ref name=\"Green\"/>  This represents the male hierarchy's imposed ownership on everything physical and even metaphysical\u2014Lily's freedom\u2014in addition to the impossibility to seek an escape route.  This is the struggle that drives the novel, and is one of the reasons it is considered Modernist.\n\nWhile Bert and Lily's trajectory is away from Birmingham, Young 'Dick' Dupret's novelistic journey takes him toward Birmingham and the factory there.  His father falls ill during the novel and dies, leaving the business to his son.  There are many disputes between Dupret and Mr Bridges in particular, who is the factory's works manager and fulfils the day-to-day running duties of the factory.  Mr Bridges fears for his job as Dupret seeks to reorganise the factory and its workers.  Indeed, he retires the dozen or so workers who are within just a few months of the national pension age.  Again, the shifting world and entropic status of the factory and the workers places the novel in its Modernist category.\n\nOne of the competing story-lines between Dupret and Lily is their mutual attempts at finding partners for marriage.  Neither are successful, and their respective failures are indicative of the constraints that social norms and the ''status quo'' place upon people of both working and upper classes.\n\nWhen Lily and Bert finally elope, much to the chagrin of Craigan and Joe Gates\u2014Lily's father\u2014they get as far as Liverpool where Bert's parents live.  Lily and Bert, however, fail to find his parents and Bert abandons Lily, leaving her with her suitcase near to the tramline where she can hitch a ride back to the train station.  Her return home represents the impossibility of women's full emancipation in the ''de facto'' world, even though two Representation of the People acts had been passed since the Great War (in [[Representation of the People Act 1918|1918]] and [[Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928|1928]]) which enfranchised women with increasing levels of suffrage.\n\nLily returns ashamedly to her Birmingham home after the failed elopement, increasingly certain that a woman's role was in the domestic space at home.  However, Craigan's illness has made him realise that he needs her perhaps more than she needs him.  In this way, this Modernist text encapsulates the changing interwar world in Britain by demonstrating the problems encountered in the British class-system and in its ''[[de facto]]'' (if no longer ''[[de jure]]'') patriarchy; but it also offers an alternative and a sign of hope through it all.  Lily embodies that hope and that possibility of a different future, even if the steps to women's emancipation are incremental and not as large as the juridical changes had hoped.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Living (Novel)}}\n[[Category:1929 British novels]]\n[[Category:Novels by Henry Green]]\n[[Category:Modernist novels]]\n[[Category:Novels set in Birmingham, West Midlands]]\n[[Category:J.

It is considered a work of [[Modernist literature]].\n\nThe novel has been acclaimed for making Green \"an honorary member of a literary movement to which he never belonged\",<ref name=\"Ortega\">\"The Language of the Working-Class Novel\" by Ramon Lopez Ortega, in Gustav Klaus, H. (Ed.) ''The Socialist Novel in Britain'', Brighton:Harvester Press, 1982, p123-4</ref> i.e. the genre of [[proletarian literature]]. Despite his class origin and politics, the novel has been acclaimed as \"closer to the world of the [[working class]] than those of some [[socialism|socialist]] or worker-writers themselves\".<ref name =\"Ortega\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n''Living'' tells the story of several iron foundry workers in the West Midlands city of Birmingham, England in the 1920s.  It also follows, though in much less detail, the lives of the foundry's owners and, in particular, their social living.  The key narrative progressions centre on Lily Gates, the novel's female protagonist, and her courting with Bert Jones, one of the factory workers.  They seek an opportunity to escape the British working-class existence by travelling abroad.  Crucial to their attempted elopement is Lily's desire to work.  She is constantly stifled in this venture by the man she calls 'Grandad', Craigan, who is her father's best friend and with whom she lives.  Craigan tells Lily that ' \"[n]one o' the womanfolk go to work from the house I inhabit' \".<ref name=\"Green\"/>  This represents the male hierarchy's imposed ownership on everything physical and even metaphysical\u2014Lily's freedom\u2014in addition to the impossibility to seek an escape route.  This is the struggle that drives the novel, and is one of the reasons it is considered Modernist.\n\nWhile Bert and Lily's trajectory is away from Birmingham, Young 'Dick' Dupret's novelistic journey takes him toward Birmingham and the factory there.  His father falls ill during the novel and dies, leaving the business to his son.  There are many disputes between Dupret and Mr Bridges in particular, who is the factory's works manager and fulfils the day-to-day running duties of the factory.  Mr Bridges fears for his job as Dupret seeks to reorganise the factory and its workers.  Indeed, he retires the dozen or so workers who are within just a few months of the national pension age.  Again, the shifting world and entropic status of the factory and the workers places the novel in its Modernist category.\n\nOne of the competing story-lines between Dupret and Lily is their mutual attempts at finding partners for marriage.  Neither are successful, and their respective failures are indicative of the constraints that social norms and the ''status quo'' place upon people of both working and upper classes.\n\nWhen Lily and Bert finally elope, much to the chagrin of Craigan and Joe Gates\u2014Lily's father\u2014they get as far as Liverpool where Bert's parents live.  Lily and Bert, however, fail to find his parents and Bert abandons Lily, leaving her with her suitcase near to the tramline where she can hitch a ride back to the train station.  Her return home represents the impossibility of women's full emancipation in the ''de facto'' world, even though two Representation of the People acts had been passed since the Great War (in [[Representation of the People Act 1918|1918]] and [[Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928|1928]]) which enfranchised women with increasing levels of suffrage.\n\nLily returns ashamedly to her Birmingham home after the failed elopement, increasingly certain that a woman's role was in the domestic space at home.  However, Craigan's illness has made him realise that he needs her perhaps more than she needs him.  In this way, this Modernist text encapsulates the changing interwar world in Britain by demonstrating the problems encountered in the British class-system and in its ''[[de facto]]'' (if no longer ''[[de jure]]'') patriarchy; but it also offers an alternative and a sign of hope through it all.  Lily embodies that hope and that possibility of a different future, even if the steps to women's emancipation are incremental and not as large as the juridical changes had hoped.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Living (Novel)}}\n[[Category:1929 British novels]]\n[[Category:Novels by Henry Green]]\n[[Category:Modernist novels]]\n[[Category:Novels set in Birmingham, West Midlands]]\n[[Category:J.

Irish, Italian, Jewish, and Polish gangs smuggled in most of the illegal whiskey, and the oldest sections of the borough became poverty-stricken.\n\nBetween 1930 and 1960, moderate and upper income Bronxites (predominantly non-Hispanic Whites) began to relocate from the southwestern neighborhoods of the borough. This migration has left a mostly poor African American and Hispanic (largely [[Puerto Ricans in the United States|Puerto Rican]]) population in the West Bronx. One significant factor that shifted the racial and economic demographics was the construction of Co-op City, built with the intent of housing middle-class residents in family-sized apartments. The high-rise complex played a significant role in draining middle-class residents from older tenement buildings in the borough's southern and western fringes. Most predominantly non-Hispanic White communities today [[Demographics of the Bronx|are located in the eastern and northwestern sections of the borough]].\n\nFrom the early 1960s to the early 1980s, the [[quality of life]] changed for some Bronx residents. Historians and social scientists have suggested many factors, including the theory that [[Robert Moses]]' [[Cross Bronx Expressway]] destroyed existing residential neighborhoods and created instant slums, as put forward in [[Robert Caro]]'s biography ''[[The Power Broker]]''.<ref>{{Cite Power Broker}}</ref> Another factor in the Bronx's decline may have been the development of [[high-rise]] [[Public housing in the United States and Canada|housing projects]], particularly in the [[South Bronx]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://americanrealities.org/locations/south_bronx/ |title=The South Bronx |publisher=American Realities}}</ref> Yet another factor may have been a reduction in the real estate listings and property-related financial services offered in some areas of the Bronx, such as [[mortgage loan]]s or insurance policies\u2014a process known as [[redlining]]. Others have suggested a \"[[planned shrinkage]]\" of municipal services, such as fire-fighting.<ref>Roderick Wallace: \"A synergism of plagues: 'planned shrinkage,' contagious housing destruction, and AIDS in the Bronx.\" ''Environmental Research'', October 1988, Vol. 47, No. 1, pp. 1\u201333, and \"Urban desertification, public health and public order: 'planned shrinkage', violent death, substance abuse and AIDS in the Bronx\", ''Social Science & Medicine'', Vol. 37, No. 7 (1990) pp. 801\u2013813\u2014abstracts retrieved on July 5, 2008 from [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ PubMed].

Like the northernmost part of [[upper Manhattan]], the [[West Bronx]]'s hilly terrain leaves a relatively free-style street grid. Much of the West Bronx's street numbering carries over from upper Manhattan, but does not match it exactly; East 132nd Street is the lowest numbered street in the Bronx. This dates from the mid-19th century when the southwestern area of [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] west of the Bronx River, was incorporated into New York City and known as the Northside.\n\nThe [[East Bronx]] is considerably flatter, and the street layout tends to be more regular. Only the [[Wakefield, Bronx|Wakefield]] neighborhood picks up the street numbering, albeit at a misalignment due to Tremont Avenue's layout. At the same diagonal latitude, West 262nd Street in Riverdale matches East 237th Street in Wakefield.\n\nThree major north\u2013south thoroughfares run between Manhattan and the Bronx: [[Third Avenue]], [[Park Avenue]], and [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]]. Other major north\u2013south roads include the [[Grand Concourse (Bronx)|Grand Concourse]], [[Jerome Avenue]], [[Sedgwick Avenue]], [[Webster Avenue]], and [[White Plains Road]]. Major east-west thoroughfares include [[Mosholu Parkway]], [[Gun Hill Road (Bronx)|Gun Hill Road]], [[Fordham Road]], [[Pelham Parkway]], and Tremont Avenue.\n\nMost east\u2013west streets are prefixed with either ''East'' or ''West'', to indicate on which side of Jerome Avenue they lie (continuing the similar system in Manhattan, which uses [[Fifth Avenue]] as the dividing line).<ref>[http://www.thirteen.org/metrofocus/2012/02/unlock-the-grid-then-ditch-the-maps-and-apps/ \"Unlock the Grid, Then Ditch the Maps and Apps\"], [[WNET]], February 24, 2012.

It voted heavily for the winning Republican [[Warren G. Harding]] in [[United States presidential election in New York, 1920|1920]], but much more narrowly on a split vote for his victorious Republican successor [[Calvin Coolidge]] in [[United States presidential election in New York, 1924|1924]] (Coolidge 79,562; [[John W. Davis]], Dem., 72,834; [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.|Robert La Follette]], 62,202 equally divided between the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924)|Progressive]] and [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist]] lines).\n\nSince then, the Bronx has always supported the Democratic Party's nominee for President, starting with a vote of 2\u20131 for the unsuccessful [[Al Smith]] in 1928, followed by four 2\u20131 votes for the successful [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. (Both had been Governors of New York, but Republican former Gov. [[Thomas E. Dewey]] won only 28% of the Bronx's vote in 1948 against 55% for Pres. [[Harry Truman]], the winning Democrat, and 17% for [[Henry A. Wallace]] of the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressives]]. It was only 32 years earlier, by contrast, that another Republican former Governor who narrowly lost the Presidency, [[Charles Evans Hughes]], had won 42.6% of the Bronx's 1916 vote against Democratic President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s 49.8% and Socialist candidate [[Allan Benson]]'s 7.3%.)<ref>''[[The World Almanac and Book of Facts]]'' for 1929 & 1957; [http://ourcampaigns.com/ContainerHistory.html?ContainerID=9099 Our Campaigns (New York Counties Bronx President History)]; ''[[The Encyclopedia of New York City]]'', edited by [[Kenneth T.

The only Republican to carry the Bronx since 1914 was [[Fiorello La Guardia]] in 1933, 1937 and 1941 (and in the latter two elections, only because his 30% to 32% vote on the [[American Labor Party]] line was added to 22% to 23% as a Republican).<ref>(The Republican line exceeded the ALP's in every other borough)</ref> The Bronx was thus the only borough not carried by the successful Republican re-election campaigns of Mayors [[Rudolph Giuliani]] in 1997 and [[Michael Bloomberg]] in 2005. The anti-war [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist]] campaign of [[Morris Hillquit]] in the [[New York City mayoral election, 1917|1917 mayoral election]] won over 31% of the Bronx's vote, putting him second and well ahead of the 20% won by the incumbent pro-war Fusion Mayor [[John P. Mitchel]], who came in second (ahead of Hillquit) everywhere else and outpolled Hillquit citywide by 23.2% to 21.7%.<ref>To see a comparison of borough votes for Mayor, see [[New York City mayoral elections#How the boroughs voted]]</ref>\n\n{|border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin:auto; margin:1em 1em 1em 0; border:1px #aaa solid; border-collapse:collapse; font-size:100%;\"\n| colspan=\"8\" style=\"background:#d5d5d5;\"| {{center|'''The Bronx County vote for President and Mayor since 1952'''}}\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#ff7;\"|'''President and Vice President of the United States'''|| style=\"background:#ffd588;\" colspan=\"3\"|'''Mayor of the City of New York'''\n|- style=\"background:#ff7;\"\n!

The original [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] opened in 1923 on 161st Street and River Avenue, a year that saw the Yankees bring home their first of 27 [[World Series]] Championships. With the famous facade, the short right field porch and Monument Park, Yankee Stadium has been home to many of baseball's greatest players including [[Babe Ruth]], [[Lou Gehrig]], [[Joe DiMaggio]], [[Whitey Ford]], [[Yogi Berra]], [[Mickey Mantle]], [[Reggie Jackson]], [[Thurman Munson]], [[Don Mattingly]], [[Derek Jeter]] and [[Mariano Rivera]].\n\nThe original stadium was the scene of [[Lou Gehrig]]'s Farewell Speech in 1939, Don Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series, Roger Maris' record breaking 61st home run in 1961, and Reggie Jackson's 3 home runs to clinch Game 6 of the 1977 World Series. The Stadium was the former home of the [[New York Giants]] of the [[National Football League]] from 1956 to 1973.\n\nThe original Yankee Stadium closed in 2008 to make way for a new [[Yankee Stadium]] in which the team started play in 2009. It is located north-northeast of the 1923 Yankee Stadium, on the former site of Macombs Dam Park. The current Yankee Stadium is also the home of [[New York City FC]] of [[Major League Soccer]], who began play in 2015.\n\n===Off-Off-Broadway===\n{{Main|Off-Off-Broadway}}\nThe Bronx is home to several [[Off-Off-Broadway]] theaters, many staging new works by immigrant playwrights from Latin America and Africa. The [[Pregones Theater]], which produces Latin American work, opened a new 130-seat theater in 2005 on Walton Avenue in the South Bronx. Some artists from elsewhere in New York City have begun to converge on the area, and housing prices have nearly quadrupled in the area since 2002. However rising prices directly correlate to a housing shortage across the city and the entire metro area.\n\n===Arts===\nThe [[Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance]], founded in 1998 by [[Arthur Aviles]] and Charles Rice-Gonzalez, provides dance, theatre and art workshops, festivals and performances focusing on contemporary and modern art in relation to race, gender, and sexuality. It is home to the Arthur Aviles Typical Theatre, a contemporary dance company, and the Bronx Dance Coalition. The Academy was formerly in the [[American Bank Note Company Building]] before relocating to a venue on the grounds of St. Peter's Episcopal Church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baadbronx.org/about.html|title=About|website=BAAD!

Many of its exhibitions are on themes of special interest to the Bronx. Its permanent collection features more than 800 works of art, primarily by artists from Africa, Asia and Latin America, including paintings, photographs, prints, drawings, and mixed media. The museum was temporarily closed in 2006 while it underwent a major expansion designed by the architectural firm [[Arquitectonica]].\n\nThe Bronx has also become home to a peculiar poetic tribute in the form of the \"[[Heinrich Heine]] Memorial\", better known as the [[Lorelei Fountain]]. After Heine's German birthplace of [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] had rejected, allegedly for [[anti-Semitic]] motives, a centennial monument to the radical [[German-Jewish]] poet (1797\u20131856), his incensed [[German-American]] admirers, including [[Carl Schurz]], started a movement to place one instead in [[Midtown Manhattan]], at [[Fifth Avenue]] and 59th Street. However, this intention was thwarted by a combination of ethnic antagonism, aesthetic controversy and political struggles over the institutional control of public art.<ref name=\"GrayNYT2007\">Christopher Gray, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/27/realestate/27scap.html \"Sturm und Drang Over a Memorial to Heinrich Heine\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 27, 2007, retrieved on July 3, 2008.

The following year, at the height of the decade's civil unrest, the festival was extended to a one-week event.  In the 1980s the key event, the \"Bronx Ball,\" was launched.

The line entered the pop-consciousness with Game Two of the [[1977 World Series]], when a fire broke out near [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] as the team was playing the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. Numerous fires had previously broken out in the Bronx prior to this fire. As the fire was captured on live television, announcer [[Howard Cosell]] [[The Bronx Is Burning#Summary|is wrongly remembered to have said something like]], \"There it is, ladies and gentlemen: the Bronx is burning\".

They are set in the heart of the Bronx, showing apartment life and the then-landmark Krums ice cream parlor. In the 1979 film ''[[The Warriors (film)|The Warriors]]'', the eponymous gang go to a meeting in [[Van Cortlandt Park]] in the Bronx, and have to fight their way out of the borough and get back to [[Coney Island]] in [[Brooklyn]]. ''[[A Bronx Tale]]'' (1993) depicts gang activities in the [[Belmont, Bronx|Belmont]] \"Little Italy\" section of the Bronx. The 2005 video game adaptation features levels called Pelham, Tremont, and \"Gunhill\" (a play off the name [[Gun Hill Road (Bronx)|Gun Hill Road]]). This theme lends itself to the title of ''[[The Bronx Is Burning]]'', an eight-part [[ESPN]] TV mini-series (2007) about the [[New York Yankees]]' drive to winning baseball's [[1977 World Series]]. The TV series emphasizes the boisterous nature of the team, led by manager [[Billy Martin]], catcher [[Thurman Munson]] and outfielder [[Reggie Jackson]], as well as the malaise of the Bronx and New York City in general during that time, such as the blackout, the city's serious financial woes and near bankruptcy, the arson for insurance payments, and the election of [[Ed Koch]] as mayor.\n\nThe 1981 film ''[[Fort Apache, The Bronx]]'' is another film that used the Bronx's gritty image for its storyline. The movie's title is from the nickname for the 41st Police Precinct in the South Bronx which was nicknamed \"Fort Apache\". Also from 1981 is the horror film ''[[Wolfen (film)|Wolfen]]'' making use of the rubble of the Bronx as a home for werewolf type creatures. ''[[Knights of the South Bronx]]'', a true story of a teacher who worked with disadvantaged children, is another film also set in the Bronx released in 2005. The Bronx was the setting for the 1983 film ''[[Fuga dal Bronx]]'', also known as ''Bronx Warriors 2'' and ''Escape 2000'', an Italian B-movie best known for its appearance on the television series ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''. The plot revolves around a sinister construction corporation's plans to depopulate, destroy and redevelop the Bronx, and a band of rebels who are out to expose the corporation's murderous ways and save their homes. The film is memorable for its almost incessant use of the phrase, \"Leave the Bronx!\" Many of the movie's scenes were filmed in [[Queens]], substituting as the Bronx. ''[[Rumble in the Bronx]]'', filmed in Vancouver, was a 1995 [[Jackie Chan]] [[kung-fu]] film, another which popularized the Bronx to international audiences. ''[[Last Bronx]]'', a 1996 Sega game played on the bad reputation of the Bronx to lend its name to an alternate version of post-Japanese bubble Tokyo, where crime and gang warfare is rampant.\n\n===Literature===\n{{See also|List of books set in New York City}}\n\n====Books====\nThe Bronx has been featured significantly in fiction literature. All of the characters in [[Herman Wouk]]'s [[City Boy: The Adventures of Herbie Bookbinder]] (1948) live in the Bronx, and about half of the action is set there. [[Kate Simon]]'s ''Bronx Primitive: Portraits of a Childhood'' is directly autobiographical, a warm account of a Polish-Jewish girl in an immigrant family growing up before World War II, and living near [[Arthur Avenue]] and [[Tremont Avenue]].<ref>Kate Simon, ''Bronx Primitive: Portraits in a Childhood.'' New York: Harper Colophon, 1983.</ref> In Jacob M. Appel's short story, \"The Grand Concourse\" (2007),<ref>''[[The Threepenny Review]]'', [http://www.threepennyreview.com/tocs/109_sp07.html Volume 109, Spring 2007]</ref> a woman who grew up in the iconic [[Lewis Morris]] Building returns to the [[Morrisania]] neighborhood with her adult daughter. Similarly, in [[Avery Corman]]'s book ''The Old Neighborhood'' (1980),<ref>[[Avery Corman]], ''The Old Neighborhood'', [[Simon & Schuster]], 1980; {{ISBN|0-671-41475-5}}</ref> an upper-middle class white protagonist returns to his birth neighborhood ([[Fordham Road]] and the [[Grand Concourse (Bronx)|Grand Concourse]]), and learns that even though the folks are poor, Hispanic and African-American, they are good people.\n\nBy contrast, [[Tom Wolfe]]'s ''[[The Bonfire of the Vanities|Bonfire of the Vanities]]'' (1987)<ref>Tom Wolfe, ''The Bonfire of the Vanities'', [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] 1987 (hardback) {{ISBN|978-0-374-11535-7}}, Picador Books 2008 (paperback) {{ISBN|978-0-312-42757-3}}</ref> portrays a wealthy, white protagonist, Sherman McCoy, getting lost off the [[Bruckner Expressway]] in the [[South Bronx]] and having an altercation with locals. A substantial piece of the last part of the book is set in the resulting riotous trial at the Bronx County Courthouse. However, times change, and in 2007, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that \"the Bronx neighborhoods near the site of Sherman's accident are now dotted with townhouses and apartments.\" In the same article, the Reverend [[Al Sharpton]] (whose fictional analogue in the novel is \"Reverend Bacon\") asserts that \"twenty years later, the cynicism of ''The Bonfire of the Vanities'' is as out of style as [[Tom Wolfe]]'s wardrobe.\"<ref>Anne Barnard, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/10/nyregion/10bonfire.html Twenty Years After 'Bonfire,' A City No Longer in Flames], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 10, 2007, retrieved on July 1, 2008</ref>\n\n[[Don DeLillo]]'s ''[[Underworld (DeLillo novel)|Underworld]]'' (1997) is also set in the Bronx and offers a perspective on the decline of the area from the 1950s onwards.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n====Poetry====\nIn poetry, the Bronx has been immortalized by one of the world's shortest [[couplet]]s:\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">The Bronx\nNo Thonx\n: [[Ogden Nash]], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', 1931</poem>\n\nNash repented 33 years after his [[calumny]], penning in 1964 the following [[prose poem]] to the Dean of [[Bronx Community College]]:\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">I can't seem to escape\nthe sins of my smart-alec youth;\nHere are my amends.\nI wrote those lines, \"The Bronx?\nNo thonx\";\nI shudder to confess them.\nNow I'm an older, wiser man\nI cry, \"The Bronx?\nGod bless them!\"<ref name=\"thonx\" /></poem>\n\nIn 2016, W. R. Rodriguez published ''Bronx Trilogy''\u2014consisting of ''the shoe shine parlor poems et al'', ''concrete pastures of the beautiful bronx'', and ''from the banks of brook avenue''. The trilogy celebrates Bronx people, places, and events. [[DeWitt Clinton High School]], [[St. Mary's Park (Bronx)|St. Mary's Park]], and Brook Avenue are a few of the schools, parks, and streets Rodriguez uses as subjects for his poems.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/wr-rodriguez/banks-brook-avenue/|title=From the Banks of Brook Avenue by W.R.

The book, which includes the work of Yiddish poets, offers a selection from [[Allen Ginsberg]]'s ''[[Kaddish (poem)|Kaddish]]'', as his Aunt Elanor and his mother, Naomi, lived near Woodlawn Cemetery. Also featured is Ruth Lisa Schecther's poem, \"Bronx\", which is described as a celebration of the borough's landmarks.

Originally, the area was part of the [[Lenape]]'s [[Lenapehoking]] territory inhabited by [[Siwanoy]] of the [[Wappinger]] Confederacy. Over time, European colonists converted the borough into farmlands.\n\n===Before 1914===\n{{See also|List of former municipalities in New York City}}\nThe development of the Bronx is directly connected to its strategic location between [[New England]] and New York ([[Manhattan]]).

The [[Great Depression]] and post World War II years saw a slowing of growth leading into an eventual decline.

Irish, Italian, Jewish, and Polish gangs smuggled in most of the illegal whiskey, and the oldest sections of the borough became poverty-stricken.\n\nBetween 1930 and 1960, moderate and upper income Bronxites (predominantly non-Hispanic Whites) began to relocate from the southwestern neighborhoods of the borough. This migration has left a mostly poor African American and Hispanic (largely [[Puerto Ricans in the United States|Puerto Rican]]) population in the West Bronx. One significant factor that shifted the racial and economic demographics was the construction of Co-op City, built with the intent of housing middle-class residents in family-sized apartments. The high-rise complex played a significant role in draining middle-class residents from older tenement buildings in the borough's southern and western fringes. Most predominantly non-Hispanic White communities today [[Demographics of the Bronx|are located in the eastern and northwestern sections of the borough]].\n\nFrom the early 1960s to the early 1980s, the [[quality of life]] changed for some Bronx residents. Historians and social scientists have suggested many factors, including the theory that [[Robert Moses]]' [[Cross Bronx Expressway]] destroyed existing residential neighborhoods and created instant slums, as put forward in [[Robert Caro]]'s biography ''[[The Power Broker]]''.<ref>{{Cite Power Broker}}</ref> Another factor in the Bronx's decline may have been the development of [[high-rise]] [[Public housing in the United States and Canada|housing projects]], particularly in the [[South Bronx]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://americanrealities.org/locations/south_bronx/ |title=The South Bronx |publisher=American Realities}}</ref> Yet another factor may have been a reduction in the real estate listings and property-related financial services offered in some areas of the Bronx, such as [[mortgage loan]]s or insurance policies\u2014a process known as [[redlining]]. Others have suggested a \"[[planned shrinkage]]\" of municipal services, such as fire-fighting.<ref>Roderick Wallace: \"A synergism of plagues: 'planned shrinkage,' contagious housing destruction, and AIDS in the Bronx.\" ''Environmental Research'', October 1988, Vol. 47, No. 1, pp. 1\u201333, and \"Urban desertification, public health and public order: 'planned shrinkage', violent death, substance abuse and AIDS in the Bronx\", ''Social Science & Medicine'', Vol. 37, No. 7 (1990) pp. 801\u2013813\u2014abstracts retrieved on July 5, 2008 from [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ PubMed].

Like the northernmost part of [[upper Manhattan]], the [[West Bronx]]'s hilly terrain leaves a relatively free-style street grid. Much of the West Bronx's street numbering carries over from upper Manhattan, but does not match it exactly; East 132nd Street is the lowest numbered street in the Bronx. This dates from the mid-19th century when the southwestern area of [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] west of the Bronx River, was incorporated into New York City and known as the Northside.\n\nThe [[East Bronx]] is considerably flatter, and the street layout tends to be more regular. Only the [[Wakefield, Bronx|Wakefield]] neighborhood picks up the street numbering, albeit at a misalignment due to Tremont Avenue's layout. At the same diagonal latitude, West 262nd Street in Riverdale matches East 237th Street in Wakefield.\n\nThree major north\u2013south thoroughfares run between Manhattan and the Bronx: [[Third Avenue]], [[Park Avenue]], and [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]]. Other major north\u2013south roads include the [[Grand Concourse (Bronx)|Grand Concourse]], [[Jerome Avenue]], [[Sedgwick Avenue]], [[Webster Avenue]], and [[White Plains Road]]. Major east-west thoroughfares include [[Mosholu Parkway]], [[Gun Hill Road (Bronx)|Gun Hill Road]], [[Fordham Road]], [[Pelham Parkway]], and Tremont Avenue.\n\nMost east\u2013west streets are prefixed with either ''East'' or ''West'', to indicate on which side of Jerome Avenue they lie (continuing the similar system in Manhattan, which uses [[Fifth Avenue]] as the dividing line).<ref>[http://www.thirteen.org/metrofocus/2012/02/unlock-the-grid-then-ditch-the-maps-and-apps/ \"Unlock the Grid, Then Ditch the Maps and Apps\"], [[WNET]], February 24, 2012.

It voted heavily for the winning Republican [[Warren G. Harding]] in [[United States presidential election in New York, 1920|1920]], but much more narrowly on a split vote for his victorious Republican successor [[Calvin Coolidge]] in [[United States presidential election in New York, 1924|1924]] (Coolidge 79,562; [[John W. Davis]], Dem., 72,834; [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.|Robert La Follette]], 62,202 equally divided between the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924)|Progressive]] and [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist]] lines).\n\nSince then, the Bronx has always supported the Democratic Party's nominee for President, starting with a vote of 2\u20131 for the unsuccessful [[Al Smith]] in 1928, followed by four 2\u20131 votes for the successful [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. (Both had been Governors of New York, but Republican former Gov. [[Thomas E. Dewey]] won only 28% of the Bronx's vote in 1948 against 55% for Pres. [[Harry Truman]], the winning Democrat, and 17% for [[Henry A. Wallace]] of the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressives]]. It was only 32 years earlier, by contrast, that another Republican former Governor who narrowly lost the Presidency, [[Charles Evans Hughes]], had won 42.6% of the Bronx's 1916 vote against Democratic President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s 49.8% and Socialist candidate [[Allan Benson]]'s 7.3%.)<ref>''[[The World Almanac and Book of Facts]]'' for 1929 & 1957; [http://ourcampaigns.com/ContainerHistory.html?ContainerID=9099 Our Campaigns (New York Counties Bronx President History)]; ''[[The Encyclopedia of New York City]]'', edited by [[Kenneth T.

The only Republican to carry the Bronx since 1914 was [[Fiorello La Guardia]] in 1933, 1937 and 1941 (and in the latter two elections, only because his 30% to 32% vote on the [[American Labor Party]] line was added to 22% to 23% as a Republican).<ref>(The Republican line exceeded the ALP's in every other borough)</ref> The Bronx was thus the only borough not carried by the successful Republican re-election campaigns of Mayors [[Rudolph Giuliani]] in 1997 and [[Michael Bloomberg]] in 2005. The anti-war [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist]] campaign of [[Morris Hillquit]] in the [[New York City mayoral election, 1917|1917 mayoral election]] won over 31% of the Bronx's vote, putting him second and well ahead of the 20% won by the incumbent pro-war Fusion Mayor [[John P. Mitchel]], who came in second (ahead of Hillquit) everywhere else and outpolled Hillquit citywide by 23.2% to 21.7%.<ref>To see a comparison of borough votes for Mayor, see [[New York City mayoral elections#How the boroughs voted]]</ref>\n\n{|border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin:auto; margin:1em 1em 1em 0; border:1px #aaa solid; border-collapse:collapse; font-size:100%;\"\n| colspan=\"8\" style=\"background:#d5d5d5;\"| {{center|'''The Bronx County vote for President and Mayor since 1952'''}}\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#ff7;\"|'''President and Vice President of the United States'''|| style=\"background:#ffd588;\" colspan=\"3\"|'''Mayor of the City of New York'''\n|- style=\"background:#ff7;\"\n!

The original [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] opened in 1923 on 161st Street and River Avenue, a year that saw the Yankees bring home their first of 27 [[World Series]] Championships. With the famous facade, the short right field porch and Monument Park, Yankee Stadium has been home to many of baseball's greatest players including [[Babe Ruth]], [[Lou Gehrig]], [[Joe DiMaggio]], [[Whitey Ford]], [[Yogi Berra]], [[Mickey Mantle]], [[Reggie Jackson]], [[Thurman Munson]], [[Don Mattingly]], [[Derek Jeter]] and [[Mariano Rivera]].\n\nThe original stadium was the scene of [[Lou Gehrig]]'s Farewell Speech in 1939, Don Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series, Roger Maris' record breaking 61st home run in 1961, and Reggie Jackson's 3 home runs to clinch Game 6 of the 1977 World Series. The Stadium was the former home of the [[New York Giants]] of the [[National Football League]] from 1956 to 1973.\n\nThe original Yankee Stadium closed in 2008 to make way for a new [[Yankee Stadium]] in which the team started play in 2009. It is located north-northeast of the 1923 Yankee Stadium, on the former site of Macombs Dam Park. The current Yankee Stadium is also the home of [[New York City FC]] of [[Major League Soccer]], who began play in 2015.\n\n===Off-Off-Broadway===\n{{Main|Off-Off-Broadway}}\nThe Bronx is home to several [[Off-Off-Broadway]] theaters, many staging new works by immigrant playwrights from Latin America and Africa. The [[Pregones Theater]], which produces Latin American work, opened a new 130-seat theater in 2005 on Walton Avenue in the South Bronx. Some artists from elsewhere in New York City have begun to converge on the area, and housing prices have nearly quadrupled in the area since 2002. However rising prices directly correlate to a housing shortage across the city and the entire metro area.\n\n===Arts===\nThe [[Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance]], founded in 1998 by [[Arthur Aviles]] and Charles Rice-Gonzalez, provides dance, theatre and art workshops, festivals and performances focusing on contemporary and modern art in relation to race, gender, and sexuality. It is home to the Arthur Aviles Typical Theatre, a contemporary dance company, and the Bronx Dance Coalition. The Academy was formerly in the [[American Bank Note Company Building]] before relocating to a venue on the grounds of St. Peter's Episcopal Church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baadbronx.org/about.html|title=About|website=BAAD!

Many of its exhibitions are on themes of special interest to the Bronx. Its permanent collection features more than 800 works of art, primarily by artists from Africa, Asia and Latin America, including paintings, photographs, prints, drawings, and mixed media. The museum was temporarily closed in 2006 while it underwent a major expansion designed by the architectural firm [[Arquitectonica]].\n\nThe Bronx has also become home to a peculiar poetic tribute in the form of the \"[[Heinrich Heine]] Memorial\", better known as the [[Lorelei Fountain]]. After Heine's German birthplace of [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] had rejected, allegedly for [[anti-Semitic]] motives, a centennial monument to the radical [[German-Jewish]] poet (1797\u20131856), his incensed [[German-American]] admirers, including [[Carl Schurz]], started a movement to place one instead in [[Midtown Manhattan]], at [[Fifth Avenue]] and 59th Street. However, this intention was thwarted by a combination of ethnic antagonism, aesthetic controversy and political struggles over the institutional control of public art.<ref name=\"GrayNYT2007\">Christopher Gray, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/27/realestate/27scap.html \"Sturm und Drang Over a Memorial to Heinrich Heine\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 27, 2007, retrieved on July 3, 2008.

The following year, at the height of the decade's civil unrest, the festival was extended to a one-week event.  In the 1980s the key event, the \"Bronx Ball,\" was launched.

The line entered the pop-consciousness with Game Two of the [[1977 World Series]], when a fire broke out near [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] as the team was playing the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. Numerous fires had previously broken out in the Bronx prior to this fire. As the fire was captured on live television, announcer [[Howard Cosell]] [[The Bronx Is Burning#Summary|is wrongly remembered to have said something like]], \"There it is, ladies and gentlemen: the Bronx is burning\".

They are set in the heart of the Bronx, showing apartment life and the then-landmark Krums ice cream parlor. In the 1979 film ''[[The Warriors (film)|The Warriors]]'', the eponymous gang go to a meeting in [[Van Cortlandt Park]] in the Bronx, and have to fight their way out of the borough and get back to [[Coney Island]] in [[Brooklyn]]. ''[[A Bronx Tale]]'' (1993) depicts gang activities in the [[Belmont, Bronx|Belmont]] \"Little Italy\" section of the Bronx. The 2005 video game adaptation features levels called Pelham, Tremont, and \"Gunhill\" (a play off the name [[Gun Hill Road (Bronx)|Gun Hill Road]]). This theme lends itself to the title of ''[[The Bronx Is Burning]]'', an eight-part [[ESPN]] TV mini-series (2007) about the [[New York Yankees]]' drive to winning baseball's [[1977 World Series]]. The TV series emphasizes the boisterous nature of the team, led by manager [[Billy Martin]], catcher [[Thurman Munson]] and outfielder [[Reggie Jackson]], as well as the malaise of the Bronx and New York City in general during that time, such as the blackout, the city's serious financial woes and near bankruptcy, the arson for insurance payments, and the election of [[Ed Koch]] as mayor.\n\nThe 1981 film ''[[Fort Apache, The Bronx]]'' is another film that used the Bronx's gritty image for its storyline. The movie's title is from the nickname for the 41st Police Precinct in the South Bronx which was nicknamed \"Fort Apache\". Also from 1981 is the horror film ''[[Wolfen (film)|Wolfen]]'' making use of the rubble of the Bronx as a home for werewolf type creatures. ''[[Knights of the South Bronx]]'', a true story of a teacher who worked with disadvantaged children, is another film also set in the Bronx released in 2005. The Bronx was the setting for the 1983 film ''[[Fuga dal Bronx]]'', also known as ''Bronx Warriors 2'' and ''Escape 2000'', an Italian B-movie best known for its appearance on the television series ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''. The plot revolves around a sinister construction corporation's plans to depopulate, destroy and redevelop the Bronx, and a band of rebels who are out to expose the corporation's murderous ways and save their homes. The film is memorable for its almost incessant use of the phrase, \"Leave the Bronx!\" Many of the movie's scenes were filmed in [[Queens]], substituting as the Bronx. ''[[Rumble in the Bronx]]'', filmed in Vancouver, was a 1995 [[Jackie Chan]] [[kung-fu]] film, another which popularized the Bronx to international audiences. ''[[Last Bronx]]'', a 1996 Sega game played on the bad reputation of the Bronx to lend its name to an alternate version of post-Japanese bubble Tokyo, where crime and gang warfare is rampant.\n\n===Literature===\n{{See also|List of books set in New York City}}\n\n====Books====\nThe Bronx has been featured significantly in fiction literature. All of the characters in [[Herman Wouk]]'s [[City Boy: The Adventures of Herbie Bookbinder]] (1948) live in the Bronx, and about half of the action is set there. [[Kate Simon]]'s ''Bronx Primitive: Portraits of a Childhood'' is directly autobiographical, a warm account of a Polish-Jewish girl in an immigrant family growing up before World War II, and living near [[Arthur Avenue]] and [[Tremont Avenue]].<ref>Kate Simon, ''Bronx Primitive: Portraits in a Childhood.'' New York: Harper Colophon, 1983.</ref> In Jacob M. Appel's short story, \"The Grand Concourse\" (2007),<ref>''[[The Threepenny Review]]'', [http://www.threepennyreview.com/tocs/109_sp07.html Volume 109, Spring 2007]</ref> a woman who grew up in the iconic [[Lewis Morris]] Building returns to the [[Morrisania]] neighborhood with her adult daughter. Similarly, in [[Avery Corman]]'s book ''The Old Neighborhood'' (1980),<ref>[[Avery Corman]], ''The Old Neighborhood'', [[Simon & Schuster]], 1980; {{ISBN|0-671-41475-5}}</ref> an upper-middle class white protagonist returns to his birth neighborhood ([[Fordham Road]] and the [[Grand Concourse (Bronx)|Grand Concourse]]), and learns that even though the folks are poor, Hispanic and African-American, they are good people.\n\nBy contrast, [[Tom Wolfe]]'s ''[[The Bonfire of the Vanities|Bonfire of the Vanities]]'' (1987)<ref>Tom Wolfe, ''The Bonfire of the Vanities'', [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] 1987 (hardback) {{ISBN|978-0-374-11535-7}}, Picador Books 2008 (paperback) {{ISBN|978-0-312-42757-3}}</ref> portrays a wealthy, white protagonist, Sherman McCoy, getting lost off the [[Bruckner Expressway]] in the [[South Bronx]] and having an altercation with locals. A substantial piece of the last part of the book is set in the resulting riotous trial at the Bronx County Courthouse. However, times change, and in 2007, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that \"the Bronx neighborhoods near the site of Sherman's accident are now dotted with townhouses and apartments.\" In the same article, the Reverend [[Al Sharpton]] (whose fictional analogue in the novel is \"Reverend Bacon\") asserts that \"twenty years later, the cynicism of ''The Bonfire of the Vanities'' is as out of style as [[Tom Wolfe]]'s wardrobe.\"<ref>Anne Barnard, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/10/nyregion/10bonfire.html Twenty Years After 'Bonfire,' A City No Longer in Flames], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 10, 2007, retrieved on July 1, 2008</ref>\n\n[[Don DeLillo]]'s ''[[Underworld (DeLillo novel)|Underworld]]'' (1997) is also set in the Bronx and offers a perspective on the decline of the area from the 1950s onwards.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n====Poetry====\nIn poetry, the Bronx has been immortalized by one of the world's shortest [[couplet]]s:\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">The Bronx\nNo Thonx\n: [[Ogden Nash]], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', 1931</poem>\n\nNash repented 33 years after his [[calumny]], penning in 1964 the following [[prose poem]] to the Dean of [[Bronx Community College]]:\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">I can't seem to escape\nthe sins of my smart-alec youth;\nHere are my amends.\nI wrote those lines, \"The Bronx?\nNo thonx\";\nI shudder to confess them.\nNow I'm an older, wiser man\nI cry, \"The Bronx?\nGod bless them!\"<ref name=\"thonx\" /></poem>\n\nIn 2016, W. R. Rodriguez published ''Bronx Trilogy''\u2014consisting of ''the shoe shine parlor poems et al'', ''concrete pastures of the beautiful bronx'', and ''from the banks of brook avenue''. The trilogy celebrates Bronx people, places, and events. [[DeWitt Clinton High School]], [[St. Mary's Park (Bronx)|St. Mary's Park]], and Brook Avenue are a few of the schools, parks, and streets Rodriguez uses as subjects for his poems.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/wr-rodriguez/banks-brook-avenue/|title=From the Banks of Brook Avenue by W.R.

The book, which includes the work of Yiddish poets, offers a selection from [[Allen Ginsberg]]'s ''[[Kaddish (poem)|Kaddish]]'', as his Aunt Elanor and his mother, Naomi, lived near Woodlawn Cemetery. Also featured is Ruth Lisa Schecther's poem, \"Bronx\", which is described as a celebration of the borough's landmarks.
