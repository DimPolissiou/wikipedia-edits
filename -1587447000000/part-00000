From 1970 to 1977, it was known as ''Kommunistiska F\u00f6rbundet Marxist-Leninisterna (revolution\u00e4rerna)'', abbreviated KFML(r) (The Communist League Marxist\u2013Leninists (the revolutionaries) and from 1977 to 2004 it was named ''Kommunistiska Partiet Marxist-Leninisterna (revolution\u00e4rerna)'', abbreviated KPML(r) (The Communist Party Marxist\u2013Leninists (the revolutionaries). At the 14th Party Congress held in [[Gothenburg]] in January 2005, it was decided to change the name to ''Kommunistiska Partiet'' (K).\n\nKFML(r) was founded in 1970 by a splinter group from the pro-[[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] [[Communist Party of Sweden (1967)|KFML]], which in turn had split from the [[Eurocommunist]] [[Left Party (Sweden)|Left Party]] in 1967. \"The (r)s\" (''\"(r)-arna\"'') considered that KFML had approached reformism and was not a genuine workers' movement. In 1970, it began publishing the weekly ''[[Prolet\u00e4ren]]'' (''The Proletarian''). During the 1980s, KPML(r) achieved representation in some municipalities, including Gothenburg, Sweden's second-largest city. The Gothenburg region has always been the strongest area for the party, partly because the party was started there. During the period of 1970 to 1999, the party chairman was [[Frank Baude]]. Baude was succeeded by [[Anders Carlsson (politician)|Anders Carlsson]], who held the post as chairman between 1999 and 2014. Ulf Nilsson is the current party chairman as of September 2018, succeeding [[Robert Mathiasson (politician)|Robert Mathiasson]].<ref>[http://www.proletaren.se/inrikes-kommunisterna-i-politiken/vi-star-starka-infor-framtiden Prolet\u00e4ren 2014-01-09 \u201dVi st\u00e5r starka inf\u00f6r framtiden\u201d Robert Mathiasson nyvald partiordf\u00f6rande (in Swedish only)]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aktuelltfokus.se/ulf-nilsson-ny-partiordforande-for-k/|title=Ulf Nilsson ny partiordf\u00f6rande f\u00f6r K|last=Fokus|first=Aktuellt|website=Aktuellt FokusE|language=sv-SE|access-date=2019-12-19}}</ref>\n\nIts members and sympathisers includes, or included, several Swedish celebrities such as actors [[Sven Wollter]], [[Lasse Brandeby]] and [[Kent Andersson (playwright)|Kent Andersson]] and musicians [[Ken (artist)|Ken]], [[Totta N\u00e4slund]] and [[Fred \u00c5kerstr\u00f6m]], all of whom have participated in events and gatherings arranged by the party.\n\n==Youth organisations==\nIn the early days of the party, the pro-KFML(r) fractions of the [[United FNL Groups]] (DFFG) and of the [[Swedish Clart\u00e9 League]] broke away and set up the [[Solidarity Front for the People of Indochina]] and [[Clart\u00e9 (m-l)]] respectively. In 1972, these two structures were dissolved and merged into the [[Young Communist League of Sweden (Marxist-Leninists)]] (''Sveriges Kommunistiska Ungdomsf\u00f6rbund (marxist-leninisterna)'', SKU (ml)), the new KFML(r) youth wing. Later a new students organisation, [[SKS(ml)|SKS (ml)]], was formed. Both SKU (ml) and SKS (ml) were disbanded towards the end of the 1970s as the party itself consisted mainly of young people.\n\nIn 1994, the party again launched a youth organization, [[Revolutionary Communist Youth (Sweden)|Revolutionary Communist Youth]] (RKU).\n\n==International relations==\nThe party upholds close relations with the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]], the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]], the [[Workers' Party of Belgium]], the [[Communist Party of Greece]], the [[Polisario Front]] and others.\n\nDuring the [[North Korean famine]], the party participated in charity fundraising for the delivery of humanitarian aid to [[North Korea]].

However, in 2003 it was revealed that the [[Swedish Security Service]] (S\u00e4po) already in 1970 had been secretly instructed by the Swedish government to continue surveillance of \"key individuals\" in some twenty organisations on the [[Far-left politics|far-left]] and [[Far-right politics|far-right]] of Swedish politics in spite of that ban.

It does not participate in the national elections due to financial and tactical reasons whereas it advocates boycott of the European parliament elections. However, it does participate in the municipal elections in some Swedish municipalities. In 2010, the party participated in the elections in 18 municipalities, which is the largest number of municipalities so far. Its electoral results have fluctuated over time, with high results in various cities during the late 1990s (second-largest party in [[Karlshamn Municipality|Karlshamn]], for example). In the three most recent elections, the party has lost ground electorally.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! <u>Municipality</u>\n! <u>Votes

Partiet}}) is a [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] [[political party]] in [[Sweden]] started in 1970. From 1970 to 1977, it was known as ''Kommunistiska F\u00f6rbundet Marxist-Leninisterna (revolution\u00e4rerna)'', abbreviated KFML(r) (The Communist League Marxist\u2013Leninists (the revolutionaries) and from 1977 to 2004 it was named ''Kommunistiska Partiet Marxist-Leninisterna (revolution\u00e4rerna)'', abbreviated KPML(r) (The Communist Party Marxist\u2013Leninists (the revolutionaries). At the 14th Party Congress held in [[Gothenburg]] in January 2005, it was decided to change the name to ''Kommunistiska Partiet'' (K).\n\nKFML(r) was founded in 1970 by a splinter group from the pro-[[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] [[Communist Party of Sweden (1967)|KFML]], which in turn had split from the [[Eurocommunist]] [[Left Party (Sweden)|Left Party]] in 1967. \"The (r)s\" (''\"(r)-arna\"'') considered that KFML had approached reformism and was not a genuine workers' movement. In 1970, it began publishing the weekly ''[[Prolet\u00e4ren]]'' (''The Proletarian''). During the 1980s, KPML(r) achieved representation in some municipalities, including Gothenburg, Sweden's second-largest city. The Gothenburg region has always been the strongest area for the party, partly because the party was started there. During the period of 1970 to 1999, the party chairman was [[Frank Baude]]. Baude was succeeded by [[Anders Carlsson (politician)|Anders Carlsson]], who held the post as chairman between 1999 and 2014. Ulf Nilsson is the current party chairman as of September 2018, succeeding [[Robert Mathiasson (politician)|Robert Mathiasson]].<ref>[http://www.proletaren.se/inrikes-kommunisterna-i-politiken/vi-star-starka-infor-framtiden Prolet\u00e4ren 2014-01-09 \u201dVi st\u00e5r starka inf\u00f6r framtiden\u201d Robert Mathiasson nyvald partiordf\u00f6rande (in Swedish only)]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aktuelltfokus.se/ulf-nilsson-ny-partiordforande-for-k/|title=Ulf Nilsson ny partiordf\u00f6rande f\u00f6r K|last=Fokus|first=Aktuellt|website=Aktuellt FokusE|language=sv-SE|access-date=2019-12-19}}</ref>\n\nIts members and sympathisers includes, or included, several Swedish celebrities such as actors [[Sven Wollter]], [[Lasse Brandeby]] and [[Kent Andersson (playwright)|Kent Andersson]] and musicians [[Ken (artist)|Ken]], [[Totta N\u00e4slund]] and [[Fred \u00c5kerstr\u00f6m]], all of whom have participated in events and gatherings arranged by the party.\n\n==Youth organisations==\nIn the early days of the party, the pro-KFML(r) fractions of the [[United FNL Groups]] (DFFG) and of the [[Swedish Clart\u00e9 League]] broke away and set up the [[Solidarity Front for the People of Indochina]] and [[Clart\u00e9 (m-l)]] respectively. In 1972, these two structures were dissolved and merged into the [[Young Communist League of Sweden (Marxist-Leninists)]] (''Sveriges Kommunistiska Ungdomsf\u00f6rbund (marxist-leninisterna)'', SKU (ml)), the new KFML(r) youth wing. Later a new students organisation, [[SKS(ml)|SKS (ml)]], was formed. Both SKU (ml) and SKS (ml) were disbanded towards the end of the 1970s as the party itself consisted mainly of young people.\n\nIn 1994, the party again launched a youth organization, [[Revolutionary Communist Youth (Sweden)|Revolutionary Communist Youth]] (RKU).\n\n==International relations==\nThe party upholds close relations with the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]], the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]], the [[Workers' Party of Belgium]], the [[Communist Party of Greece]], the [[Polisario Front]] and others.\n\nDuring the [[North Korean famine]], the party participated in charity fundraising for the delivery of humanitarian aid to [[North Korea]]. As a result, the party developed a degree of collaboration with the [[Workers' Party of Korea]],<ref>[http://proletaren.se/sites/default/bilder-filer/proletaren-25ars-jubileum.pdf \u201dProlet\u00e4ren 1995, Jubileumsnumret\u201d] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208054422/http://proletaren.se/sites/default/bilder-filer/proletaren-25ars-jubileum.pdf |date=2011-12-08 }}. p. 24.</ref> although this cooperation did not persist to the present day.\n[[File:Swedish left groups.gif|thumb|223x223px|Factions within the Swedish left during the last century]]\n\n==Illegal surveillance by the Swedish Security Service==\n[[File:R\u00f6dastj\u00e4rnan.jpg|thumb|The party's book shop R\u00f6da Stj\u00e4rnan (Red Star) in the city of Karlshamn]]\nIn 1969, governmental registration of an individual's political affiliation was made illegal in Sweden. However, in 2003 it was revealed that the [[Swedish Security Service]] (S\u00e4po) already in 1970 had been secretly instructed by the Swedish government to continue surveillance of \"key individuals\" in some twenty organisations on the [[Far-left politics|far-left]] and [[Far-right politics|far-right]] of Swedish politics in spite of that ban. This surveillance continued until 1998.<ref>[http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/asiktsregistrering-pagick-till-1998 Dagens Nyheter 2003-01-29: \u00c5siktsregistrering p\u00e5gick till 1998 (in Swedish only)] Retrieved 2012-04-11</ref> KFML(r)/KPML(r) and its associated organisations were among those put under such surveillance. When the files were made public, they revealed that the number of surveilled individuals of the party ranged from 2,012 in 1985 to 1,346 in 1998, which meant that almost all party members had been under surveillance.<ref>[http://www.regeringen.se/content/1/c4/04/56/62852847.pdf SOU 2002:89 Politisk \u00f6vervakning och personalkontroll 1969-2002 - in Swedish only] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050829222810/http://www.regeringen.se/content/1/c4/04/56/62852847.pdf |date=2005-08-29 }} Retrieved 2012-04-11</ref>\n\n==Electoral results==\nThe party does not participate in elections to the [[Parliament of Sweden|national]] nor the [[European parliament]]s. It does not participate in the national elections due to financial and tactical reasons whereas it advocates boycott of the European parliament elections. However, it does participate in the municipal elections in some Swedish municipalities. In 2010, the party participated in the elections in 18 municipalities, which is the largest number of municipalities so far. Its electoral results have fluctuated over time, with high results in various cities during the late 1990s (second-largest party in [[Karlshamn Municipality|Karlshamn]], for example). In the three most recent elections, the party has lost ground electorally.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! <u>Municipality</u>\n! <u>Votes 2014</u><ref>[http://www.val.se/val/val2014/slutresultat/K/rike/index.html Valmyndigheten: Val till kommunfullm\u00e4ktige 2014] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924084004/http://www.val.se/val/val2014/slutresultat/K/rike/index.html |date=2014-09-24 }} Retrieved 2017-04-27</ref>\n!

The character is known for his \"Aye-yi-yi-yi-yi!\" catchphrase.\n\nAlpha 5 has been physically portrayed by multiple actors: Romy J.

In the 2017 reboot film,  Alpha 5 is a [[CGI]] character voiced by [[Bill Hader]]. Various merchandise for the character, as with other of the series' characters, has been released since the inception of the ''Power Rangers'' franchise.\n\n==Character overview==\nAlpha 5 appears as a recurring supporting character for the ''Power Rangers'' in the series. His role is to provide communications support for the Rangers on their missions and is responsible for maintenance of the Command Center. He also serves as the Rangers' technician, constructing weapons for them to use against their opponents.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> He is best known for his signature catchphrase, \"Aye-yi-yi-yi-yi!\", usually uttered by the character when he is distressed or excited.<ref name=EW/><ref name=Nerdist/><ref name=\"Meeting\"/> Alpha 5's original iteration is described by Nicholas Mojica of ''[[International Business Times]]'' as a \"vintage robot look\"<ref name=IBT/>; his head is shaped like a golden [[flying saucer]], adorned with a visor that flashes when he is speaking.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> Another one of the character's visual cues is an inverted yellow stylized lightning bolt similar to the Power Rangers' lightning bolt symbol on his chest.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/>  \n\nThe character is depicted as naive and childlike in temperament, and often behaves like a surrogate younger sibling to the Power Rangers wanting to spend time with them.<ref name=\"Hollywood\"/>\n\n==Creation and development==\nRichard Horvitz, credited as \"Richard Wood\" for the ''Power Rangers'' series, developed Alpha\u2019s catchphrase when the series was in development.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> Horvitz also voiced Alpha 5's future successor, Alpha 7, in the ''[[Power Rangers Wild Force]]'' episode [[Forever Red]].<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/>\n\nRomy J. Sharf physically portrayed Alpha 5 for 89 episodes of the  ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'' series as well as the ''Alpha\u2019s Magical Christmas'' holiday special.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> Sandi Sellner took over the role for 19 episodes when the Power Rangers gained ninja-themed powers in season 3.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> Donene Kistler, who also worked as a production assistant on the series, assumed the role for the remainder of Alpha 5's appearances in the series.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> Kistler would go on to portray Alpha 5's successor, Alpha 6, for ''Power Rangers Turbo'' and ''Power Rangers In Space''.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> \n\n==Appearances==\n===In ''Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers''===\n{{main|Mighty Morphin Power Rangers}}\nAlpha 5 debuted in the first episode of ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'' and provides a support role for the titular protagonists. Though he is a non-combatant, Alpha 5 has occasionally been involved in direct engagements with enemy forces. In one episode, Rita sent the brainwashed [[Tommy Oliver|Green Ranger]] to sabotage the Command Center; he slipped a compact disc into Alpha's inner workings, unleashing a virus which causes him to convulse violently. After Billy repaired his circuity and removed the virus, Alpha later captured the Green Ranger in a [[force field]], but Rita rescued him before Alpha could reveal his identity. In one episode, Alpha 5 left the Command Center on Zordon's instructions to retrieve a magical item known as the \"Singing Squash\" to undo a spell placed on [[Kimberly Hart|Kimberly]] and [[Billy Cranston|Billy]]. he encountered Rita's Putty Patrol, but manages to disabled his attackers with his internal defense and the magical squash.\n\nIn the second season of ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'', Alpha had three encounters with Lord Zedd's forces. In ''The Wannabe Ranger'', he attempted to assist a little boy lost in Angel Grove Park, but was attacked by the Primator, a shapeshifting gorilla monster who disguised himself as Billy and tried to trick Alpha into taking him to the Command Center. Alpha activated his self-destruct sequence to protect the Command Center, but seemed unable to deactivate it once the Primator left, and it was necessary for the Rangers do so. Later in the season, he would leave the Command Center to rescue the now-regressed Rangers, who had been trapped within a photograph by the Photomare monster after being regressed into children. In his attempt to capture the photo, Alpha was confronted by both Photomare and [[Goldar]], but he was able to freeze both villains with a device of his and escape. Near the end of the season, in ''The Wedding'', he was ambushed by [[Villains in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers#Finster|Finster]] and the Putties as he took a hike outside the Command Center. Just as the Green Ranger had, Finster inserted a disc into Alpha's circuits, but instead of delivering a virus, this CD warped Alpha's personality into an evil, obnoxious brat, who assisted Zedd and Rita by tricking the Rangers into an abandoned theater (which Finster proceeded to fill with monsters). Alpha also cut the Rangers off from Zordon and the Thunderzords. When Zordon's pleas for him to stop annoyed him, Alpha comically altered Zordon's image before shutting him off completely. Billy eventually removed the disc from Alpha, instantly returning him to normal.\n\nIn the third season, it was revealed that Alpha was constructed on the planet Edenoi, located in the [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda constellation]] by [[Masked Rider (TV series)#Supporting|King Lexian]], the grandfather of the [[Masked Rider (TV series)#Main|Masked Rider]]. The Power Rangers later team up with the Masked Rider against Count Dregon and his forces in a crossover episode.\n\n===In ''Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers''===\n{{main|Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers}}\nAlpha initially saved the Command Center from destruction by defusing an implosion generator planted there by [[Rito Revolto|Rito]] and Goldar, though the duo's second attempt was successful as they managed to infiltrate the Command Center's basement to place Lord Zedd's detonation device. They discovered the deactivated remains of Alpha 4, Alpha 5's obsolete predecessor. Subsequently, they placed one of the detonators on Alpha 4's body, and the Center was later destroyed in the explosion.\n\n===In ''Power Rangers Zeo''===\n{{main|Power Rangers Zeo}}\nAlpha 5 was later shown to have survived the events of ''Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers'', as he is discovered to be safe within the secondary base, the '''Power Chamber'''. Now assisted by Billy, Alpha 5 continued to serve the Rangers (now the [[Power Rangers Zeo]]) as they battled the Machine Empire.<ref name=\"Dorama\"/> A brief encounter with the Cogs resulted badly for Alpha, being short-circuited by an electric shock from one of their spears.\n\n===In ''Power Rangers Turbo''===\n{{main|Power Rangers Turbo}}\nWhen Zordon left for his home planet of Eltar (in ''Shift Into Turbo''), Alpha 5 went with him, saddened that he was leaving the Rangers behind. The two later briefly returned in ''[[List of Power Rangers Turbo episodes|Passing of the Torch]]'', in which [[Tommy Oliver|Tommy]], [[Adam Park|Adam]], [[Katherine Hillard|Kat]], and [[Tanya Sloan|Tanya]] retired from their Ranger duties. In this episode, Alpha 5 is shown in his original body. This episode would be his last appearance in the franchise, as his role in the ''Power Rangers'' series is replaced by Alpha 6. Alpha 5 was last mentioned in the franchise, as the creator of the robotic versions of the Turbo Rangers in the episode \"The Robot Ranger\". \n\n==Reception==\nAlpha 5 is noted as a \"beloved\" and \"lovable\" comic relief character of the ''Power Rangers'' franchise by various sources.<ref name=\"Hollywood\"/><ref name=\"Inverse\"/><ref name=\"Chatbot\"/> Joe Anderton from ''Digital Spy'' opined that while Alpha 5  looked like he was \"made out of whatever props they could find\", to him the character's \"goofy little walk and head tilt made him feel human and relatable, as if those blinking red lights were eyes\".<ref name=\"Different\"/> Jessica Lachenal from ''The Mary Sue'' thought Alpha 5's appearance, which resembled a [[Geordi La Forge]]-style visor which light up whenever he speaks, was \"adorable\" and \"endearing\".<ref name=\"MarySue\"/>\n\n==In other media==\n===Movies===\n====''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie'' ====\n{{main|Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie}}\nPeta-Maree Rixon physically portrayed Alpha 5 as the suit actor for ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie''. Like the film's other character costumes, the Alpha 5 suit Rixon donned was specifically designed for the movie.<ref name=Screenrant/> \n\n====''Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie''====\n{{main|Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie}}\nIn ''Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie'', Alpha gains a new, streamlined body. His plating appears to be more reflective, and his lightning bolt was now an arrow pointing straight down. \n\n====''Power Rangers (2017 film)''====\n{{main|Power Rangers (2017 film)}}\n[[File:Alpha52017.png|left|upright|thumb|Concept art of Alpha 5, released as a preview to promote the 2017 film ''[[Power Rangers (film)|Power Rangers]]''.]]\nIn the 2017 reboot film, Alpha 5 is a CGI character portrayed by [[Bill Hader]].<ref name=EW/> Hader acted out Alpha 5's movements in a motion-capture suit, and provides the voiced dialogue for the character in the recording booth.<ref name=Looper/> To promote the film, Lionsgate launched a \"chat bot\" app, which features a completely personalized, spontaneous chat with Alpha 5. The app was cross-platform, enabling app users to chat with Alpha 5 on either Facebook Messenger, Kik, or Twitter in the role of a potential Power Ranger candidate, and receive exclusive content for the film as reward for the interaction.  \n\nThe film's iteration of Alpha 5 has a bio-mechanical look that uses darker hues of the original design's red and blue colors, with a pair of eye stalks dangling from the saucer-shaped head as opposed to a visor.<ref name=\"IGN\"/> Like his original TV series iteration, Alpha 5 is an android aide of Zordon; however, he has a less convivial relationship with the teenagers and is skeptical of their competence as the new Power Rangers.<ref name=\"Look\"/><ref name=\"Meeting\"/> \n\nAlpha 5's drastically different design from the original iteration received a mixed response, with some journalists labeling it \"weird\",<ref name=\"Slash\"/><ref name=\"SC\"/><ref name=\"MarySue\"/> \"horrifying\",<ref name=\"Inverse\"/> or \"nightmarish\".<ref name=\"Indie\"/> The ''[[LA Times]]'' and ''[[International Business Times]]'' both reported on strong disapproval from series fans in response to the reveal of Alpha 5's redesign.<ref name=LATimes/> <ref name=IBT/> Phillip Martinez dissented and thought that the redesign, though jarring, matched the visual language of the film's Power Rangers iteration.<ref name=\"Player\"/>\n\nThe decision to cast Hader as Alpha 5 was mostly well received by journalists.<ref name=Nerdist/><ref name=\"Meeting\"/><ref name=\"Slash\"/><ref name=\"Inverse\"/><ref name=\"Chatbot\"/> Jacob Stolworthy from ''[[The Independent]]'' considered the casting to be \"odd\".<ref name=\"Indie\"/> Joshua Rivera from [[GQ Magazine]] expressed his concerns about the film's creation direction, and wondered if Hader would adopt Alpha 5's \"classic high-pitched fretting\", Alpha 6's \"weirdly nasal [[Long Island]] stylings\", or if he would approach the role as the \"latest [[Stefon]] joint\".<ref name=GQ/> Andy Webster, in a review of the 2017 film for the ''New York Times'', commented that \"Hader's dialed-down take\" of the character \"reflects the movie's tempered refinement of the original\".<ref name=\"NYT\"/>\n\n===''Alpha's Magical Christmas''===\nAlpha 5 is the main character of ''Alpha's Magical Christmas'', a [[direct-to-video]] musical [[List of Christmas television specials|Christmas special]] produced during Season 2 of ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers''. The Rangers are away at the [[North Pole]] assisting [[Santa Claus]] in preparation for the Christmas holidays, while Alpha remains with Zordon for Christmas at the Command Center. Despite Zordon's presence, Alpha feels miserable from his loneliness. Zordon cheers Alpha up by presenting a [[Christmas tree]] to him, then follows that up by teleporting a group of children to the Command Center to sing Christmas carols with Alpha. Together they sing such carols as \"[[Good King Wenceslas]]\", \"[[Deck the Halls]]\", \"[[Here We Come A-Wassailing|Here We Come A-Caroling]]\", \"[[Jingle Bells]]\" and \"[[Silent Night (song)|Silent Night]]\". After the children leave via the \"magical portal\", Tommy, Kimberly and Billy teleport to the Command Center in their ranger suits, and the cast perform \"[[We Wish You a Merry Christmas]]\" to end the special. \n\n===Comics===\nAlpha 5 appears as a recurring character in the ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'' comic series, published by [[Boom! Studios]]. It is a modern alternate retelling of the TV series of the same name, and has no connections to any past media or the 2017 reboot film.<ref name=Screenrant/>\n\n==Promotion and merchandise==\nLike many ''Power Rangers'' series characters, various merchandise has been made of Goldar since the inception of the franchise.

The character is known for his \"Aye-yi-yi-yi-yi!\" catchphrase.\n\nAlpha 5 has been physically portrayed by multiple actors: Romy J. Sharf, Sandi Sellner and Donene Kistler in the TV series, and by Peta-Maree Rixon in ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie]]''.

In the 2017 reboot film,  Alpha 5 is a [[CGI]] character voiced by [[Bill Hader]]. Various merchandise for the character, as with other of the series' characters, has been released since the inception of the ''Power Rangers'' franchise.\n\n==Character overview==\nAlpha 5 appears as a recurring supporting character for the ''Power Rangers'' in the series. His role is to provide communications support for the Rangers on their missions and is responsible for maintenance of the Command Center. He also serves as the Rangers' technician, constructing weapons for them to use against their opponents.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> He is best known for his signature catchphrase, \"Aye-yi-yi-yi-yi!\", usually uttered by the character when he is distressed or excited.<ref name=EW/><ref name=Nerdist/><ref name=\"Meeting\"/> Alpha 5's original iteration is described by Nicholas Mojica of ''[[International Business Times]]'' as a \"vintage robot look\"<ref name=IBT/>; his head is shaped like a golden [[flying saucer]], adorned with a visor that flashes when he is speaking.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> Another one of the character's visual cues is an inverted yellow stylized lightning bolt similar to the Power Rangers' lightning bolt symbol on his chest.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/>  \n\nThe character is naive and childlike in temperament, and often behaves like a surrogate younger sibling to the Power Rangers, wanting to spend time with them and learn things such as dancing from [[Zack Taylor|Zack]].<ref name=\"Hollywood\"/>\n\n==Creation and development==\nRichard Horvitz, credited as \"Richard Wood\" for the ''Power Rangers'' series, developed Alpha\u2019s catchphrase when the series was in development.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> Horvitz also voiced Alpha 5's future successor, Alpha 7, in the ''[[Power Rangers Wild Force]]'' episode [[Forever Red]].<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/>\n\nRomy J. Sharf physically portrayed Alpha 5 for 89 episodes of the  ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'' series as well as the ''Alpha\u2019s Magical Christmas'' holiday special.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> Sandi Sellner took over the role for 19 episodes when the Power Rangers gained ninja-themed powers in season 3.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> Donene Kistler, who also worked as a production assistant on the series, assumed the role for the remainder of Alpha 5's appearances in the series.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> Kistler would go on to portray Alpha 5's successor, Alpha 6, for ''Power Rangers Turbo'' and ''Power Rangers In Space''.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> \n\n==Appearances==\n===In ''Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers''===\n{{main|Mighty Morphin Power Rangers}}\nAlpha 5 debuted in the first episode of ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'' and provides a support role for the titular protagonists. Though he is a non-combatant, Alpha 5 has occasionally been involved in direct engagements with enemy forces. In one episode, Rita sent the brainwashed [[Tommy Oliver|Green Ranger]] to sabotage the Command Center; he slipped a compact disc into Alpha's inner workings, unleashing a virus which causes him to convulse violently. After Billy repaired his circuity and removed the virus, Alpha later captured the Green Ranger in a [[force field]], but Rita rescued him before Alpha could reveal his identity. In one episode, Alpha 5 left the Command Center on Zordon's instructions to retrieve a magical item known as the \"Singing Squash\" to undo a spell placed on [[Kimberly Hart|Kimberly]] and [[Billy Cranston|Billy]]. he encountered Rita's Putty Patrol, but manages to disabled his attackers with his internal defense and the magical squash.\n\nIn the second season of ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'', Alpha had three encounters with Lord Zedd's forces. In ''The Wannabe Ranger'', he attempted to assist a little boy lost in Angel Grove Park, but was attacked by the Primator, a shapeshifting gorilla monster who disguised himself as Billy and tried to trick Alpha into taking him to the Command Center. Alpha activated his self-destruct sequence to protect the Command Center, but seemed unable to deactivate it once the Primator left, and it was necessary for the Rangers do so. Later in the season, he would leave the Command Center to rescue the now-regressed Rangers, who had been trapped within a photograph by the Photomare monster after being regressed into children. In his attempt to capture the photo, Alpha was confronted by both Photomare and [[Goldar]], but he was able to freeze both villains with a device of his and escape. Near the end of the season, in ''The Wedding'', he was ambushed by [[Villains in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers#Finster|Finster]] and the Putties as he took a hike outside the Command Center. Just as the Green Ranger had, Finster inserted a disc into Alpha's circuits, but instead of delivering a virus, this CD warped Alpha's personality into an evil, obnoxious brat, who assisted Zedd and Rita by tricking the Rangers into an abandoned theater (which Finster proceeded to fill with monsters). Alpha also cut the Rangers off from Zordon and the Thunderzords. When Zordon's pleas for him to stop annoyed him, Alpha comically altered Zordon's image before shutting him off completely. Billy eventually removed the disc from Alpha, instantly returning him to normal.\n\nIn the third season, it was revealed that Alpha was constructed on the planet Edenoi, located in the [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda constellation]] by [[Masked Rider (TV series)#Supporting|King Lexian]], the grandfather of the [[Masked Rider (TV series)#Main|Masked Rider]]. The Power Rangers later team up with the Masked Rider against Count Dregon and his forces in a crossover episode.\n\n===In ''Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers''===\n{{main|Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers}}\nAlpha initially saved the Command Center from destruction by defusing an implosion generator planted there by [[Rito Revolto|Rito]] and Goldar, though the duo's second attempt was successful as they managed to infiltrate the Command Center's basement to place Lord Zedd's detonation device. They discovered the deactivated remains of Alpha 4, Alpha 5's obsolete predecessor. Subsequently, they placed one of the detonators on Alpha 4's body, and the Center was later destroyed in the explosion.\n\n===In ''Power Rangers Zeo''===\n{{main|Power Rangers Zeo}}\nAlpha 5 was later shown to have survived the events of ''Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers'', as he is discovered to be safe within the secondary base, the '''Power Chamber'''. Now assisted by Billy, Alpha 5 continued to serve the Rangers (now the [[Power Rangers Zeo]]) as they battled the Machine Empire.<ref name=\"Dorama\"/> A brief encounter with the Cogs resulted badly for Alpha, being short-circuited by an electric shock from one of their spears.\n\n===In ''Power Rangers Turbo''===\n{{main|Power Rangers Turbo}}\nWhen Zordon left for his home planet of Eltar (in ''Shift Into Turbo''), Alpha 5 went with him, saddened that he was leaving the Rangers behind. The two later briefly returned in ''[[List of Power Rangers Turbo episodes|Passing of the Torch]]'', in which [[Tommy Oliver|Tommy]], [[Adam Park|Adam]], [[Katherine Hillard|Kat]], and [[Tanya Sloan|Tanya]] retired from their Ranger duties. In this episode, Alpha 5 is shown in his original body. This episode would be his last appearance in the franchise, as his role in the ''Power Rangers'' series is replaced by Alpha 6. Alpha 5 was last mentioned in the franchise, as the creator of the robotic versions of the Turbo Rangers in the episode \"The Robot Ranger\". \n\n==Reception==\nAlpha 5 is noted as a \"beloved\" and \"lovable\" comic relief character of the ''Power Rangers'' franchise by various sources.<ref name=\"Hollywood\"/><ref name=\"Inverse\"/><ref name=\"Chatbot\"/> Joe Anderton from ''Digital Spy'' opined that while Alpha 5  looked like he was \"made out of whatever props they could find\", to him the character's \"goofy little walk and head tilt made him feel human and relatable, as if those blinking red lights were eyes\".<ref name=\"Different\"/> Jessica Lachenal from ''The Mary Sue'' thought Alpha 5's appearance, which resembled a [[Geordi La Forge]]-style visor which light up whenever he speaks, was \"adorable\" and \"endearing\".<ref name=\"MarySue\"/>\n\n==In other media==\n===Movies===\n====''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie'' ====\n{{main|Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie}}\nPeta-Maree Rixon physically portrayed Alpha 5 as the suit actor for ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie''. Like the film's other character costumes, the Alpha 5 suit Rixon donned was specifically designed for the movie.<ref name=Screenrant/> \n\n====''Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie''====\n{{main|Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie}}\nIn ''Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie'', Alpha gains a new, streamlined body. His plating appears to be more reflective, and his lightning bolt was now an arrow pointing straight down. \n\n====''Power Rangers (2017 film)''====\n{{main|Power Rangers (2017 film)}}\n[[File:Alpha52017.png|left|upright|thumb|Concept art of Alpha 5, released as a preview to promote the 2017 film ''[[Power Rangers (film)|Power Rangers]]''.]]\nIn the 2017 reboot film, Alpha 5 is a CGI character portrayed by [[Bill Hader]].<ref name=EW/> Hader acted out Alpha 5's movements in a motion-capture suit, and provides the voiced dialogue for the character in the recording booth.<ref name=Looper/> To promote the film, Lionsgate launched a \"chat bot\" app, which features a completely personalized, spontaneous chat with Alpha 5. The app was cross-platform, enabling app users to chat with Alpha 5 on either Facebook Messenger, Kik, or Twitter in the role of a potential Power Ranger candidate, and receive exclusive content for the film as reward for the interaction.  \n\nThe film's iteration of Alpha 5 has a bio-mechanical look that uses darker hues of the original design's red and blue colors, with a pair of eye stalks dangling from the saucer-shaped head as opposed to a visor.<ref name=\"IGN\"/> Like his original TV series iteration, Alpha 5 is an android aide of Zordon; however, Alpha 5 has a less convivial relationship with the teenagers and is skeptical of their competence as the new Power Rangers.<ref name=\"Look\"/><ref name=\"Meeting\"/> \n\nAlpha 5's drastically different design from the original iteration received a mixed response, with some journalists labeling it \"weird\",<ref name=\"Slash\"/><ref name=\"SC\"/><ref name=\"MarySue\"/> \"horrifying\",<ref name=\"Inverse\"/> or \"nightmarish\".<ref name=\"Indie\"/> The ''[[LA Times]]'' and ''[[International Business Times]]'' both reported on strong disapproval from series fans in response to the reveal of Alpha 5's redesign.<ref name=LATimes/> <ref name=IBT/> Phillip Martinez dissented and thought that the redesign, though jarring, matched the visual language of the film's Power Rangers iteration.<ref name=\"Player\"/>\n\nThe decision to cast Hader as Alpha 5 was mostly well received by journalists.<ref name=Nerdist/><ref name=\"Meeting\"/><ref name=\"Slash\"/><ref name=\"Inverse\"/><ref name=\"Chatbot\"/> Jacob Stolworthy from ''[[The Independent]]'' considered the casting to be \"odd\".<ref name=\"Indie\"/> Joshua Rivera from [[GQ Magazine]] expressed his concerns about the film's creation direction, and wondered if Hader would adopt Alpha 5's \"classic high-pitched fretting\", Alpha 6's \"weirdly nasal [[Long Island]] stylings\", or if he would approach the role as the \"latest [[Stefon]] joint\".<ref name=GQ/> Andy Webster, in a review of the 2017 film for the ''New York Times'', commented that \"Hader's dialed-down take\" of the character \"reflects the movie's tempered refinement of the original\".<ref name=\"NYT\"/>\n\n===''Alpha's Magical Christmas''===\nAlpha 5 is the main character of ''Alpha's Magical Christmas'', a [[direct-to-video]] musical [[List of Christmas television specials|Christmas special]] produced during Season 2 of ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers''. The Rangers are away at the [[North Pole]] assisting [[Santa Claus]] in preparation for the Christmas holidays, while Alpha remains with Zordon for Christmas at the Command Center. Despite Zordon's presence, Alpha feels miserable from his loneliness. Zordon cheers Alpha up by presenting a [[Christmas tree]] to him, then follows that up by teleporting a group of children to the Command Center to sing Christmas carols with Alpha. Together they sing such carols as \"[[Good King Wenceslas]]\", \"[[Deck the Halls]]\", \"[[Here We Come A-Wassailing|Here We Come A-Caroling]]\", \"[[Jingle Bells]]\" and \"[[Silent Night (song)|Silent Night]]\". After the children leave via the \"magical portal\", Tommy, Kimberly and Billy teleport to the Command Center in their ranger suits, and the cast perform \"[[We Wish You a Merry Christmas]]\" to end the special. \n\n===Comics===\nAlpha 5 appears as a recurring character in the ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'' comic series, published by [[Boom! Studios]]. It is a modern alternate retelling of the TV series of the same name, and has no connections to any past media or the 2017 reboot film.<ref name=Screenrant/>\n\n==Promotion and merchandise==\nLike many ''Power Rangers'' series characters, various merchandise has been made of Goldar since the inception of the franchise.

The kindergarten program includes specialist classes in music, physical education and library, as well as a \"Bush Kinder\" nature play program.\n\nChristian College students are from a number of different areas in Geelong, these areas include Torquay, Drysdale, Anglesea, Ocean Grove, Queenscliff and Winchelsea as well as a majority from Geelong itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christiancollege.vic.edu.au|title=Private Schools in Victoria \u2013 Christian College Geelong|accessdate=19 October 2014}}</ref> Notable people to have gone to Christian College Geelong include leading Urology researcher Adjunct Professor James Kelberg, AFL players [[Gary Ablett, Jr.]], [[Nathan Ablett]], [[Matt Maguire]], [[Taylor Adams]], [[Connor Idun]], netballer [[Tegan Philip]] (nee Caldwell), World Champion synchronised swimmers Paul Little and Jarrod Middleton, and Olympian [[Jakara Anthony]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\n== History ==\nThe college opened in 1980, in the suburb of [[Highton, Victoria|Highton]] and has grown from its original 40 students to over 1900 students in 2007. The Middle School is housed in the former building of St. Augustine's Orphanage, while the Junior School uses the former Glastonbury Orphanage. The Senior Campus is located at the former Highton campus of [[Geelong Grammar School]], which was purchased by Christian College in 1999 and opened to students in 2000. The Bellarine Campus is the former council offices for the [[Rural City of Bellarine]] which was amalgamated into the [[City of Greater Geelong]] in 1993. The school bought the property in 1995 and started classes in 1996 for students on the [[Bellarine Peninsula]], which removed the burden of travelling to Geelong.\n\n== Houses ==\nThere are four houses at Christian College into which students are split. They are Penman, Flynn, Taylor and Burrows. Burrows (previously known as Hume) is named after [[Eva Burrows]], Taylor after [[Hudson Taylor]], Penman (previously known as Cunningham) after [[David John Penman]] and Flynn after [[John Flynn (minister)|John Flynn]]. Burrows are the current holders of the school D.C. Riddle Cup (awarded at the Senior Campus). This cup is awarded to the house that earns the most points over the four major carnivals of Athletics, Cross Country, Swimming and House Music. There are also various lunch time activities that also earn points towards the D.C. Riddle Cup. These lunch time activities include Cricket, Basketball, Netball, AFL, Soccer, \"Letters and Numbers\" (maths and English) competition and Drama.\n\n== Music program ==\nChristian College has a music program for strings, wind, percussion, piano, brass and bass. The school also has bands, choirs, orchestras, and symphonies that compete every year. In the [[Melbourne School Bands Festival]] 2008, Christian College Geelong received a Gold Award in the Advanced Concert Band Section. Christian College also had a tour to Sydney where some of the Christian College Bands performed at the [[Sydney Opera House]]. The music department (in conjunction with the drama department) stages a bi-annual school musical, the most recent being ''Wizard of Oz'' in April 2013 with \"Seussical The Musical\" being May 2011.\n\nRecently the school also travelled to Hawaii to take part in the Annual Pacific Basin Music Festival, and received a gold award.\n\n== Controversy ==\nIn October 2015, at \"Celebration Day\" celebrations for the departure of Year 12s, three students arrived in an unauthorised helicopter, causing controversy inside and outside the school.\n\nThe incident was covered by the ''Geelong Advertiser'', ''The Age'' and Channel 9 News. The following year's \"Celebration Day\" for the departure of Year 12s was cancelled due to fear of a repeat event occurring. This caused for more controversy inside and outside the school, leading to the ''Geelong Advertiser'', ''The Age'' and ''Herald Sun'' covering the story.\n\nThe result of 2020 synchronised swimming caused quite a stir amongst the college community. Penman are the house that many believe to have won the competition. However, the winner Flynn won by one point and many believe this due to an external judge was biased toward the house. This caused a petition to be handed around the college senior campus to reward penman as champions however this was quickly shut down by campus leaders. Penman had the last laugh on the day eventually being rewarded swimming champions. Due to the [[Coronavirus disease 2019|Covid-19]] penman have place either 2<sup>nd</sup> or above in every event played this year. This would mean if no more events take place Penman would be rewarded the 2020 D.C. Riddle Cup only after Five events have taken place.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.christiancollege.vic.edu.au Official website]\n\n{{coord|38|11|17|S|144|18|12|E|region:AU-VIC_type:edu|display=title}} <!--Senior Campus, Waurn Ponds -->\n\n[[Category:Private secondary schools in Victoria (Australia)]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1980]]\n[[Category:Schools in Geelong]]\n[[Category:1980 establishments in Australia]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=February 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2019}}\n[[File:Christian College Geelong.jpg|thumb|250px|Middle School building in Highton, the former St. Augustine's Orphanage]]\n\n{{Refimprove|date=January 2018}}\n\n'''Christian College''' is a P-12 independent school located over five campuses in [[Geelong, Victoria|Geelong]], Victoria, Australia.<ref>[http://www.christiancollege.vic.edu.au/Main.asp?_=Christian%20Ethos Christian College \u2013 Christian Ethos<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719180845/http://www.christiancollege.vic.edu.au/Main.asp?_=Christian%20Ethos |date=19 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThree campuses are located in suburban Geelong:  the Senior Campus at [[Waurn Ponds, Victoria|Waurn Ponds]] (Year 10\u201312), the Middle School in [[Highton, Victoria|Highton]] (Year 5\u20139), and the Junior School in [[Belmont, Victoria|Belmont]] (Prep \u2013 Year 4).
