Imelda is the sixth of Vicente's eleven children, and Remedios's firstborn.{{sfn|Pedrosa|1969|page=61}}\n\nBorn into the Romu\u00e1ldez political dynasty from the [[Leyte|province of Leyte]], Imelda grew up in a wealthy clan of ''cat\u00f3licos cerrados'' (literally, \"Closed Catholics\"), a local term for strict and devout [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Latin-Rite Catholics]].{{sfn|Pedrosa|1987b}}{{page needed|date=November 2018}} For Imelda's birth, her father hired two physicians and reserved a suite at an extravagant rate of 25 [[Philippine peso|pesos]] per day. Vicente justified the high cost to relatives by saying, \"This child will be important.\"{{sfn|Pedrosa|1987|pp=16\u201317}} She was immediately baptized the day after her birth by [[Monsignor]] Juan Somera in the nearby [[San Miguel Church, Manila|San Miguel Church]]. Her grandmother, ''Do\u00f1a'' Trinidad L\u00f3pez de Romu\u00e1ldez, was the clan [[Matriarchy|matriarch]].\n\nSome other notable members of Imelda's family are her uncle [[Norberto Romualdez]], who was [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Philippine Supreme Court]] Associate Justice and the first of the Romualdezes to achieve national prominence,{{sfn|Pedrosa|1987b}}{{page needed|date=November 2018}} and her younger brother [[Benjamin Romualdez|Benjamin \"Kokoy\" Romualdez]], who served as the Governor of Leyte and also as an ambassador under the [[Ferdinand Marcos|Marcos]] regime.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n=== Early childhood ===\nAt the time of her birth, the Romualdezes had the comforts of material prosperity and had the reputation of wealthy Manilans. However, around 1931\u20131932, the financial conditions of Imelda's family began to decline.{{sfn|Pedrosa|1969}}{{page needed|date=November 2018}}<ref name=\"MartialLawChroniclesWoman\"/>\n\nImelda's parents were separated for a time, during which Remedios worked for the nuns at the [[Asilo de San Vicente de Paul]].{{sfn|Pedrosa|1969}}{{page needed|date=November 2018}} Vicente and Remedios eventually reconciled but to avoid further conflict, she and her children, including Imelda moved to their house's garage. In 1937 after Conchita's birth, Remedios's health began to fail and she died on 7 April 1938 due to [[double pneumonia]].{{sfn|Pedrosa|1969}}{{page needed|date=November 2018}}  In her ten years of marriage, Imelda had five siblings \u2013 Benjamin, Alita, Alfredo, Armando and Conchita.{{sfn|Polotan|1970}}{{page needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nOn the same year, 1938,{{sfn|Pedrosa|1969}}{{page needed|date=November 2018}} Imelda's father gave up Manila due to his declining fortunes in his law practice and returned to [[Tacloban]] where he could support his family with a simpler lifestyle. She speaks [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and English, the two [[official language]]s of the Philippines, as well as [[Waray language|Waray]], the regional language of Leyte.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n=== Education ===\n\n==== Elementary ====\nImelda finished grade one in the nearby [[College of the Holy Spirit Manila|Holy Ghost College]], where her older half-sisters also studied.\n\nShe continued her early studies at Holy Infant Academy, a convent school run by [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine Sisters]]. The old wooden structure of the school still stands today four blocks away from the Romualdez house. At school, Imelda had to face the fact of her family's humiliating poverty. She was frequently among the students who had to apologize for late payments.{{sfn|Pedrosa|1987b|p=54}}\n\n==== High school ====\nIn 1942, the Romualdezes returned to [[Tacloban]], and around that time, Imelda's father refused to let her go back to school.{{sfn|Polotan|1970|p=54}} When the Americans came, she lined up with a hundred other young girls in wooden clogs at the [[Leyte Progressive High School|Leyte High School]], eager to resume her studies. The year was 1944. She finished first year at the provincial high school where she was also chosen Miss I-A; then in her second year, she moved to Holy Infant and stayed there until she graduated.{{sfn|Polotan|1970|p=56}}\n\nImelda continued her higher studies at Holy Infant Academy from 1938 to 1948, the year she graduated from high school. As a student, her scholastic record shows that she had a general average of 80 per cent throughout her primary and high school.{{sfn|Pedrosa|1969}}{{page needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n==== College ====\nImelda ran for President of the student council at [[Divine Word University|St. Paul's College]] (now [[Divine Word University]]) in 1951, three years before her marriage to Marcos.{{sfn|Pedrosa|1987b}}{{page needed|date=November 2018}} At that time, she was about to graduate with a degree in Education.

The mere mention of Imelda attending a rally would make people attend the rally and scamper for a place near the stage, not to listen to the speeches, but rather just to see the lovely wife of Ferdinand Marcos.

One reason Marcos married Imelda, aside from her physical charms, was because she was a Romualdez\u2014an aristocrat. Imelda's beauty, as well as her background, was appreciated to a great extent by Marcos and Marcos believed she would not only add light to his daily life but also to his political career.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nImelda, coming from a family who practiced a simple lifestyle, had initial difficulties adjusting to her husband's extravagant lifestyle. She once complained that she was only earning a hundred and twenty pesos a month despite her hard labor. To this, Marcos laughed and said that it was her fault that she was working hard only for such an amount. This was a turning point for Imelda to no longer feel guilty about spending money. From then on, she pushed herself to extreme luxury.{{sfn|Pedrosa|1987b|p=88}}\n\nImelda was expected to be sophisticated, elegant, and well versed by her husband. Marcos knew that having a supportive wife, a trophy that he could be proud of, would gain him more supporters as well as votes. Imelda began dressing herself with expensive clothes and made every effort to become the person whom her husband wanted her to be.{{sfn|Pedrosa|1987b|p=90}}\n\nIn her efforts to be the perfect wife, she was often criticised for trying too hard, but at the same time, she became a subject of envy for fellow politicians' wives. Imelda learned how to get people's attention and to focus it on both her and her husband. She reached out to every single person who was seen as essential in Marcos's campaign. Her efforts were not original, but extraordinary. No other politicians' wives shook hands with all the delegates, visited their homes, genuinely understood their concerns, aside from Imelda. She bombarded them with gifts when necessary.{{sfn|Pedrosa|1987b|p=97}}\n\nNot only was Imelda good with people, she was also a skilled mediator who mended broken relationships that occurred with Marcos. During Marcos's presidency in the [[Nacionalista Party]], [[Fernando Lopez]], back then Marcos's vice presidential running mate, was unwilling to continue his political career. Marcos asked Imelda to help him mend ties with Lopez, and Imelda burst into tears in order to convince Lopez that he should run as the Nacionalista vice presidential candidate.{{sfn|Pedrosa|1987b|p=101}}\n\nBy the time Marcos was campaigning to become President, Imelda's influence in Marcos's political career was crucial. Her husband may have been a good tactician, but it was Imelda's determination and popularity that ensured votes for him. Marcos heavily relied on Imelda, and as time passed, Imelda was no longer a clone of Marcos.

It was also at this time that Dr. Daniel Vasquez and Maria Luisa opened a [[Citibank]] account. In November 1968, the couple added Fernanda Vazquez as a joint holder of the bank account.

Leavold at the time had sold the 2007 rough cut of his documentary [[The Search for Weng Weng|''The Search for Weng Weng'']] about [[Weng Weng]], the Philippines first international celebrity and the shortest leading man in film history who happens to be a remarkable [[stunt performer]] and [[Martial arts|martial artist]]. The film was turned into another documentary about the films made during the time of the Weng Weng's height called [[Machete Maidens Unleashed!|''Machete Maidens Unleashed!'']] (2010) directed by [[Mark Hartley]]. When Leavold interviewed Imelda Marcos for this new project, she was in complete denial about these films. Eventually, Leavold decided to asked her about Weng Weng. Marcos taken aback for an instant eventually said: The appearance of Weng Weng showed the great Filipino spirit. They can make a hero of a disabled, distorted guy. So everybody had a chance. They have such a democratic attitude. The Filipino have no prejudice. He entertained us. He was distorted but he could make us laugh and make us happy. What a talent, to have almost nothing and then to make people happy, I salute. Additionally, Marcos invited Leavold to her birthday and an additional day at [[Ferdinand Marcos]]' resting place.<ref name=\":02\">{{cite AV media|title=''The Search for Weng Weng''|date=|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|type=DVD|language=English|publisher=Wild Eye Releasing|location=USA|id=760137943594|}}</ref> The footage Leavold gathered with her allowed him to convince the production house who had originally bought ''The Search for Weng Weng'' to relaunch the project.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/09/23/19/the-anc-brief-no-country-an-island|title=The ANC Brief: No country an island|last=News|first=ABS-CBN|website=ABS-CBN News|language=en|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.manilatimes.net/2019/10/05/opinion/columnists/newly-discovered-bonifacio-movie/626513/|title=Newly discovered Bonifacio movie|website=The Manila Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/you-me-and-imelda-brisbane-filmmakers-unexpected-philippines-adventure-20120831-255or.html|title=You, me and Imelda: Brisbane filmmakers' unexpected Philippines adventure|last=Nancarrow|first=Dan|date=2012-08-31|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/in-search-of-weng-weng-the-pint-sized-james-bond-of-filipino-film-20140805-100lbw.html|title=In search of Weng Weng, the pint-sized James Bond of Filipino film|last=Wilson|first=Jake|date=2014-08-07|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref>\n\n''The Search for Weng Weng'' was completed in 2013, was well received, played in the festival circuits, and in some countries had a limited theatrical release is some countries.<ref>{{Citation|title=Machete Maidens Unleashed!

Imelda is the sixth of Vicente's eleven children, and Remedios's firstborn.{{sfn|Pedrosa|1969|page=61}}\n\nBorn into the Romu\u00e1ldez political dynasty from the [[Leyte|province of Leyte]], Imelda grew up in a wealthy clan of ''cat\u00f3licos cerrados'' (literally, \"Closed Catholics\"), a local term for strict and devout [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Latin-Rite Catholics]].{{sfn|Pedrosa|1987b}}{{page needed|date=November 2018}} For Imelda's birth, her father hired two physicians and reserved a suite at an extravagant rate of 25 [[Philippine peso|pesos]] per day.

The old wooden structure of the school still stands today four blocks away from the Romualdez house. At school, Imelda had to face the fact of her family's humiliating poverty. She was frequently among the students who had to apologize for late payments.{{sfn|Pedrosa|1987b|p=54}}\n\n==== High school ====\nIn 1942, the Romualdezes returned to [[Tacloban]], and around that time, Imelda's father refused to let her go back to school.{{sfn|Polotan|1970|p=54}} When the Americans came, she lined up with a hundred other young girls in wooden clogs at the [[Leyte Progressive High School|Leyte High School]], eager to resume her studies. The year was 1944. She finished first year at the provincial high school where she was also chosen Miss I-A; then in her second year, she moved to Holy Infant and stayed there until she graduated.{{sfn|Polotan|1970|p=56}}\n\nImelda continued her higher studies at Holy Infant Academy from 1938 to 1948, the year she graduated from high school.

She was put up as candidate for the Department of Education, which had an enrollment of 800 students. Even during the nomination, her victory was already a foregone conclusion, but the school authorities insisted that another candidate be put up to make the elections a democratic procedure.

Imelda's status in the house of Romualdez during this time has been described as \"higher than servants and lower than family members as a poor relative\". Imelda found work as a salesgirl in a store called P. E.

They were able to use her by attracting normal folk from their daily activities to attend a Marcos rally to see the \"beautiful wife of Marcos\" themselves. The mere mention of Imelda attending a rally would make people attend the rally and scamper for a place near the stage, not to listen to the speeches, but rather just to see the lovely wife of Ferdinand Marcos.

One reason Marcos married Imelda, aside from her physical charms, was because she was a Romualdez\u2014an aristocrat. Imelda's beauty, as well as her background, was appreciated to a great extent by Marcos and Marcos believed she would not only add light to his daily life but also to his political career.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nImelda, coming from a family who practiced a simple lifestyle, had initial difficulties adjusting to her husband's extravagant lifestyle. She once complained that she was only earning a hundred and twenty pesos a month despite her hard labor. To this, Marcos laughed and said that it was her fault that she was working hard only for such an amount. This was a turning point for Imelda to no longer feel guilty about spending money. From then on, she pushed herself to extreme luxury.{{sfn|Pedrosa|1987b|p=88}}\n\nImelda was expected to be sophisticated, elegant, and well versed by her husband. Marcos knew that having a supportive wife, a trophy that he could be proud of, would gain him more supporters as well as votes. Imelda began dressing herself with expensive clothes and made every effort to become the person whom her husband wanted her to be.{{sfn|Pedrosa|1987b|p=90}}\n\nIn her efforts to be the perfect wife, she was often criticised for trying too hard, but at the same time, she became a subject of envy for fellow politicians' wives. Imelda learned how to get people's attention and to focus it on both her and her husband. She reached out to every single person who was seen as essential in Marcos's campaign. Her efforts were not original, but extraordinary. No other politicians' wives shook hands with all the delegates, visited their homes, genuinely understood their concerns, aside from Imelda. She bombarded them with gifts when necessary.{{sfn|Pedrosa|1987b|p=97}}\n\nNot only was Imelda good with people, she was also a skilled mediator who mended broken relationships that occurred with Marcos. During Marcos's presidency in the [[Nacionalista Party]], [[Fernando Lopez]], back then Marcos's vice presidential running mate, was unwilling to continue his political career. Marcos asked Imelda to help him mend ties with Lopez, and Imelda burst into tears in order to convince Lopez that he should run as the Nacionalista vice presidential candidate.{{sfn|Pedrosa|1987b|p=101}}\n\nBy the time Marcos was campaigning to become President, Imelda's influence in Marcos's political career was crucial. Her husband may have been a good tactician, but it was Imelda's determination and popularity that ensured votes for him. Marcos heavily relied on Imelda, and as time passed, Imelda was no longer a clone of Marcos. Instead, she had become his political partner.{{sfn|Pedrosa|1987b|p=103}}\n\n=== The 1965 Inauguration ===\n[[File:Imelda Marcos at the Bataan Death March Memorial Plaque.jpg|thumb|309x309px|Imelda Marcos at the Bataan Death March Memorial]]\nFerdinand Marcos was [[1965 Philippine presidential election|elected]] as the [[List of Presidents of the Philippines|10th]] President of the Philippines on 9 November 1965.{{sfn|Ellison|1988|p=7\u201310}} When he was inaugurated on 30 December 1965, Imelda officially became the First Lady.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nThe Romualdez clan had been torn apart by the presidential campaign.

It was also at this time that Dr. Daniel Vasquez and Maria Luisa opened a [[Citibank]] account. In November 1968, the couple added Fernanda Vazquez as a joint holder of the bank account.

The film was turned into another documentary about the films made during the time of the Weng Weng's height called [[Machete Maidens Unleashed!|''Machete Maidens Unleashed!'']] (2010) directed by [[Mark Hartley]]. When Leavold interviewed Imelda Marcos for this new project, she was in complete denial about these films. Eventually, Leavold decided to asked her about Weng Weng. Marcos taken aback for an instant eventually said: The appearance of Weng Weng showed the great Filipino spirit. They can make a hero of a disabled, distorted guy. So everybody had a chance. They have such a democratic attitude. The Filipino have no prejudice. He entertained us. He was distorted but he could make us laugh and make us happy. What a talent, to have almost nothing and then to make people happy, I salute.

However, the head coach of Bra\u015fov Daniel Iseyle later stated that the transition of the Karmanyans was unlikely to be completed because of the complexity of the negotiations, which reached a standstill.<ref>{{cite web|script-title=ru:\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u044b \u0441 \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043c\u044f\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0448\u043b\u0438 \u0432 \u0442\u0443\u043f\u0438\u043a |url=http://www.armsport.am/ru/news/2/48/11376/ |publisher=armsport.am |accessdate=31 March 2013 |language=ru |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821234259/http://www.armsport.am/ru/news/2/48/11376/ |archivedate=21 August 2010 }}</ref> Talks were later made for the brothers to play for [[FC Astra Giurgiu|Astra Giurgiu]], coached by [[Mihai Stoichi\u021b\u0103]].

[[Armenia]]n [[association football|footballer]] and former international for the [[Armenia national football team|Armenian national team]].

While Arman left that season, Artavazd would remain in the club for a number of seasons.\n\n===Loans to Bra\u015fov and Gloria Bistri\u0163a===\nArman was loaned to other Liga I clubs [[FC Bra\u015fov|Bra\u015fov]] and [[ACF Gloria 1922 Bistri\u021ba|Gloria Bistri\u0163a]] for the 2005 season.\n\n===Second loan to Bra\u015fov===\nHe was loaned to [[FC Bra\u015fov|Bra\u015fov]] again at the start of the 2006 season.\n\n===Ceahl\u0103ul Piatra Neam\u0163===\nArman than officially signed with [[FC Ceahl\u0103ul Piatra Neam\u021b|Ceahl\u0103ul Piatra Neam\u0163]].\n\n===Politehnica Timi\u015foara===\nBoth Arman and Artavazd reunited in the club [[FC Politehnica Timi\u0219oara|Politehnica Timi\u015foara]] in 2007.

But the process of finding a new club was delayed. Later, it was reported that the brothers were in talks with [[FC Bra\u0219ov|Bra\u015fov]]. However, the head coach of Bra\u015fov Daniel Iseyle later stated that the transition of the Karmanyans was unlikely to be completed because of the complexity of the negotiations, which reached a standstill.<ref>{{cite web|script-title=ru:\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u044b \u0441 \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043c\u044f\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0448\u043b\u0438 \u0432 \u0442\u0443\u043f\u0438\u043a |url=http://www.armsport.am/ru/news/2/48/11376/ |publisher=armsport.am |accessdate=31 March 2013 |language=ru |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821234259/http://www.armsport.am/ru/news/2/48/11376/ |archivedate=21 August 2010 }}</ref> Talks were later made for the brothers to play for [[FC Astra Giurgiu|Astra Giurgiu]], coached by [[Mihai Stoichi\u021b\u0103]].

{"title_page": "William St Lawrence, 14th Baron Howth", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2019}}\n{{Use Irish English|date=November 2019}}\n'''William St Lawrence, 14th Baron Howth'''  (1688-1748) was an Irish peer and  politician, who enjoyed the friendship of [[Jonathan Swift]].\n\n==Early life==\n\nHe was the eldest of the five  sons of [[Thomas St Lawrence, 13th Baron Howth]] and his wife  Mary Barnewall, daughter of  Henry,  2nd  [[Viscount Barnewall of Kingsland]] and  his second wife Lady Mary Nugent.<ref>Pine, L.G.  ''The New Extinct Peerage''  London 1972 p.152</ref> He lived for part of each  year in [[Howth Castle]], but also spent much of his time at   [[Kilfane]]  House near [[Thomastown]], [[County Kilkenny]], where he could indulge his passion for sport .<ref>Ball, F. Elrington  ''History of Dublin'' Vol. 5  \"Howth and its Owners\"  University Press Dublin 1917  p. 135</ref>\n\nHe sat in the [[Irish House of Commons]] as MP  for [[Ratoath (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Ratoath]] between 1716 and 1727. He was regarded as a man of shrewd political judgement, and became a member of the [[Privy Council of Ireland]] in 1739.<ref>Pine p.152</ref>\n\n==Marriage and children==\n\nShortly after succeeding to the title  he married Lucy Gorges, fourth  daughter of  General Richard Gorges of Kilbrew, [[County Meath]], and  his first wife Nichola Sophia Hamilton.

The college was established in 1869 by [[Emily Davies]] and [[Barbara Bodichon]] as the first [[women's college]] in Cambridge. In 1948, it was granted full college status by the university, marking the official admittance of women to the university. In 1976, it was the first Cambridge women's college to become [[mixed-sex education|coeducational]].\n\nThe main College site, situated on the outskirts of the village of [[Girton, Cambridgeshire|Girton]], about 2.5&nbsp;miles (4&nbsp;km) northwest of the university town, comprises {{convert|33|acre|ha|1}} of land. In a typical [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] red brick design, most was built by architect [[Alfred Waterhouse]] between 1872 and 1887. It provides extensive sports facilities, an indoor swimming pool, an award-winning library and a chapel with two organs. There is an accommodation annexe, known as Swirles Court, situated in the Eddington neighborhood of the [[North West Cambridge development]]. Swirles opened in 2017 and provides up to 325 en-suite single rooms for graduates, and for second-year undergraduates and above.\n\nThe College has several equal-access admittance schemes. It has a reputation for musical talent. Several art collections are held on the main site, including ''People's Portraits'', the millennial exhibition of the [[Royal Society of Portrait Painters]], and an Egyptian collection containing the world's most reproduced [[Fayum mummy portraits|portrait mummy]].\n\nAmong Girton's notable alumni are Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark]], [[President of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|UK Supreme Court President]] [[Brenda Hale, Baroness Hale of Richmond|Lady Hale]], ''[[HuffPost]]'' co-founder [[Arianna Huffington]], the comedian/author [[Sandi Toksvig]], the comedian/broadcaster/GP [[Phil Hammond (comedian)|Phil Hammond]], the economist [[Joan Robinson]], and the anthropologist [[Marilyn Strathern]], also Mistress from 1998 to 2009.\n\nIts [[sister college]] is [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville College]], one of the first two women's colleges of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Cambridge - Girton College Main Gate - June 2018.jpg|thumb|Main gate with porter's lodge]]\n\n===1869 to 1976: Pioneering for women's education===\nThe early feminist movement began to argue for the improvement of women's education in the 1860s<!--Mary Lyon opened Mount Holyoke for that purpose in 1837-->: [[Emily Davies]] and [[Barbara Bodichon]] met through their activism at the [[Society for Promoting the Employment of Women|Society for the Employment of Women]] and the [[Englishwoman's Review]].<ref>Stephen 1933, p.6</ref> They shared the aim of securing women's admission to university.<ref>Stephen 1933, p.7</ref> In particular, they wanted to determine whether girls could be admitted at Oxford or Cambridge to sit the Senior and Junior Local Examinations.<ref>Megson and Lindsay 1961, pp.1\u20132</ref> Davies and Bodichon set up a committee to that effect in 1862. In 1865, with the help of Henry Tomkinson, [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] alumnus and owner of an insurance company with good contacts within the University,<ref>Bradbrook 1969, p.7</ref> 91 female students entered the Cambridge Local Examination.<ref>Megson and Lindsay 1961, p.2</ref> This first concession to women's educational rights met relatively little resistance, as admission to the examination did not imply residence of women at the university site.<ref>Stephen 1933, p.10</ref>\n\n[[File:Girton College Water Colour.jpg|thumb|Water colour by the architect of Girton College Alfred Waterhouse]]\nAt that time, students had the option of doing a Pass degree, which consisted of \"a disorderly collection of fragmented learning\",<ref>Brooke p.209</ref> or an [[Honours degree]], which at that time meant the Mathematics [[Tripos]], classics, natural or moral sciences. An Honours degree was considered more challenging than the Pass degree. In 1869, [[Henry Sidgwick]] helped institute the Examinations for Women, which was designed to be of intermediate difficulty.<ref>Winstanley 1977 p.154</ref> This idea was heavily opposed by Emily Davies, as she demanded admittance to the Tripos examinations.<ref>Stephen 1933, p.23</ref>\n\nThe college was established on 16 October 1869 under the name of the '''College for Women at Benslow House''' in [[Hitchin]], Hertfordshire, which was considered to be a convenient distance from Cambridge and London.<ref>Jones 1913, pp.16\u201317</ref> It was thought to be less \"risky\" and less controversial to locate the college away from Cambridge in the beginning.<ref>Stephen 1933, p.25</ref> The college was one of [[England]]'s first residential colleges for women. ([[Whitelands College]], now part of the [[University of Roehampton]], was established as a college of higher education for women earlier, in 1841.) They worked with Fanny Metcalfe to develop the curricula.<ref>{{cite book |last=Murray |first=J.

In 1884, Hospital Wing was completed, and Orchard Wing, Stanley Library and the Old Kitchens added. At that time, Girton had 80 students. By 1902, Tower Wing, Chapel Wing and Woodlands Wing as well as the Chapel and the Hall were finished, which allowed the college to accommodate 180 students.<ref name=\"Bradbrook 1969, p.161\" />\n\nIn 1921, a committee was appointed to draft a charter for the college. By summer 1923 the committee had completed the task, and on 21 August 1924 the [[George V of the United Kingdom|King]] granted the charter to \"the Mistress and Governors of Girton College\" as a [[Body corporate|Body Corporate]].<ref>Stephen 1933, 120\u2013121</ref> Girton was not officially a college yet, nor were its members part of the University. Girton and [[Newnham College, Cambridge|Newnham]] were classed as \"recognised institutions for the higher education for women\", not colleges of the university. On 27 April 1948, women were admitted to full membership of the University of Cambridge, and Girton College received the status of a college of the university.\n\n===1976 to present: Pioneering for sexual equality===\nSocial and cultural changes in the [[Aftermath of World War II|post-war period]] led to an increasing number of British universities to become co-educational. In Cambridge, [[Churchill College, Cambridge|Churchill College]], [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]] and [[Clare College, Cambridge|Clare College]] were the first men's colleges to admit women in 1972.<ref>Horsler and Strathern 2005, p.58</ref> Girton had already amended its statutes in 1971 in such a way as to allow the admission of men should the Governing Body vote in favour at an unspecified date in the future.<ref>Horsler and Strathern 2005, p.63</ref> The decision to become mixed came in November 1976, when the Governing Body voted to act upon the statute, which made Girton the first women's college to admit men.<ref>Horsler and Strathern 2005, p.17</ref> In January 1977, the first two male [[Fellow]]s, Frank Wilkinson and John Marks, arrived, followed by male graduate students in 1978, and, finally, undergraduates in October 1979.<ref>Horsler and Strathern 2005, p.19</ref> One reason for the change was that the first mixed colleges in Cambridge immediately shot to the top of the Tripos league tables, as they seemed to attract bright students, who preferred to stay in co-educational colleges.<ref>Horsler and Strathern 2005, p.80</ref>\n\nGirton became co-residential as well, which meant that male and female students shared the same facilities. Only one all-female corridor in which rooms were reserved exclusively for women remained. Upon the arrival of male undergraduates, [[Common Room (university)|JCR and MCR]] social facilities had to be enlarged. The college bar was opened in 1979 as well as rugby, cricket and soccer pitches provided from 1982 onwards.<ref>Horsler and Strathern 2005, p.73</ref><ref>Horsler and Strathern 2005, p.40</ref>\n\nIn the 22-year period from 1997 to 2019, the [[Tompkins Table]] annual ranking of Cambridge colleges by undergraduate academic performance ranked Girton College an average of 20 out of the 29 colleges researched.

The Lamb who may alone open the book sealed with seven seals is shown at the foot of the light, while the descent of the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove is shown at its apex.

The scenes are linked with a pattern of leaves. Palm is used for the Entry into Jerusalem, and among other plants represented are the Star of Bethlehem, the Passion Flower and the Thorn.

Recent Girton Balls have become much larger and more decadent than their earlier counterparts and the majority of the College site is now included in the Ball area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thetab.com/uk/cambridge/2014/03/17/girton-spring-ball-2014-review-34569 |title=Girton Spring Ball 2014 |author= Will Heilpern |year= 2014 |website= |publisher= The Tab |accessdate=18 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcs.cam.ac.uk/lifestyle/0032105-review-girton-spring-ball.html |title=Review: Girton Spring Ball |author= Emma Dixon |year= 2014 |website= |publisher= The Cambridge Student |accessdate=18 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.varsity.co.uk/reviews/7057 |title=Review: Girton Spring Ball |author= Louis Degenhardt and Laura Spence |year= 2014 |website= |publisher= Varsity |accessdate=18 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe 2016 Spring Ball, to feature headliners [[Tinchy Stryder]] and [[Bipolar Sunshine]], was anticipated to be the largest and greatest Girton Ball to date.

As [[Academic dress of the University of Cambridge|academic dress]], gowns were adopted with little changes (the sleeves had to be closed so that even in the summer, when women wear short-sleeved dresses their bare shoulders do not show), and square caps were chosen as head-dress. However, to remember the time when women were not allowed to obtain degrees of the University of Cambridge, no gowns are worn during the college feast, when students in their final year are celebrated.\n\n===Graces===\nGirton College has a traditional two-word grace and a more recent full grace, both in Latin.  On regular formal occasions, such as [[Formal (university)|Formal Halls]], the two-word graces are spoken, ''Benedictus benedicat'' (May the blessed one give blessing) at the start of the meal, and ''Benedictus benedicatur'' (May praise be given to the blessed one) at the end of the meal. There is evidence that the two-word grace was used in 1926, and it is thought the two-word grace <!-- is that grace, singular, or graces, plural? what exactly does Freeman refer to? --> was used from the foundation of the college onwards.<ref>{{cite book |title=Alma Mater: Memoirs of Girton College 1926\u20131929 |last=Freeman |first=Gwendolen |authorlink= |year=1993 |publisher=David and Charles |location=Devon |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate= |asin=}}</ref>\n\nThe words and the music of the full grace were composed in 1950 by Alison Duke and Jill Vlasto respectively.<ref name=\"Wheeler 2002\">{{cite journal | last = Wheeler| first = Graham| authorlink = | title = Dining graces at Cambridge colleges| journal =| volume = | issue = | pages =| publisher = paper presented to the Interdisciplinary Seminar, Faculty of Classics| location = Cambridge| year = 2002|url =| doi =}}</ref> The grace came after the admission of women to full membership of the university so as to bring Girton in line with the other colleges.<ref name=\"Wheeler 2002\"/> It is used on the most formal occasions, such as the Foundation Dinner, and it is sung once a year at the College Feast, which all final year students attend.\n\nFull grace (in Latin):\n\n<blockquote><poem>''Benedic Domine, nobis et omnibus huius collegii alumnis,\ndonisque tuis quae de munificentia tua sumus iam sumpturi;\net illis salubriter nutriti debitas tibi gratias pie reddamus.\nCustodi, quaesumus, Domine, filios et filias\net consule necessitatibus animarum et corporum,\nhoc ipso momento et in aeternum.''</poem></blockquote>\n\nFull grace (English translation):\n<blockquote><poem>Bless us, O Lord, and all members of this college,\nand also thy gifts, which of thy bounty we are about to receive;\nand having been wholesomely nourished by the same let us dutifully render to thee the thanks that are owed.\nProtect, we beseech thee, O Lord, thy sons and daughters and provide for the needs both of our souls and bodies,\nat this present time and for evermore.</poem></blockquote>\n\n===Songs===\n[[File:The Girton Pioneers.jpg|thumb|right|''The Girton Pioneers'' (tune of [[The British Grenadiers]]) honours the first three women to sit the [[Tripos|Tripos exams]]]]\nThe oldest college song, ''The Girton Pioneers'', was composed by several students in Hitchin in 1873.<ref name=\"College songs GC 2010\"/> Its purpose was to celebrate the first three students who sat the Tripos examinations in 1871.<ref name=\"Jones 1913 p.28f\">Jones 1913 p.28f.</ref> It is sung with the tune of ''[[The British Grenadiers]]''. This is the first stanza:\n\n<blockquote><poem>Some talk of Senior Wranglers,\nAnd some of Double Firsts,\nAnd truly of their species\nThese are not the worst;\nBut of all the Cambridge heroes\nThere\u2019s none that can compare\nWith Woodhead, Cook and Lumsden,\nThe Girton Pioneers.<ref name=\"Jones 1913 p.28f\"/></poem></blockquote>\n\nMore recently, Girtonians have become known for their chant of ''We are Girton \u2013 super Girton! No one likes us, but we don't care''!, in imitation of the [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] fans' famous song: ''[[No one likes us, we don't care]]''. The reference to ''no one likes us'' is supposedly due to the relative distance of Girton in comparison to many of the other colleges. In 2016 the Casual Choir performed ''Long Way to Girton College'', an adaptation of ''[[It's a Long Way to Tipperary]]'', written and arranged by two choir members.\n\nThe college song ''I love to go a-bicycling'', sung with the tune of'' I love to go a-wandering'' also alludes to Girton's 2.5 miles distance from the town centre. It has been sung since the 1960s.<ref name=\"College songs GC 2010\"/> For example, the second stanza reads:\n<blockquote><poem>But when I climb up Castle Hill\nIn the wind and squall\nA strong desire does then me fill\nTo be-e at [[Murray Edwards College, Cambridge|New Hall]].\n\n''Chorus:''\nFol-de-re, Fol-de-ra,\nFol-de-re, Fol-de-ra-a-a-a-\n.... To be-e at New Hall.<ref name=\"College songs GC 2010\"/></poem></blockquote>\n\nAnother song, composed in 1972 by [[Common Room (university)|JCR]] president Anna Cocconi,<ref name=\"College songs GC 2010\"/> is called ''Song to Wolfson Court''. The annexe of the college was opened in that year. Students often found fault with the modern architecture of the building, which was less spacious and elegant than the main site. The first two stanzas go as follows:\n<blockquote><poem> In a wheat field, west of Cambridge,\nOff a lane called Clarkson Road,\nWolfson Court is standing proudly;\nLet its story now be told\n\nHundred rooms with running water,\nCould you ever ask for more?\nNot unless you choose a boy-friend,\nMeas\u2019ring over five foot four!<ref name=\"College songs GC 2010\"/></poem></blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Girton College Boat Club]]\n* [[:Category:Alumni of Girton College, Cambridge]]\n* [[:Category:Fellows of Girton College, Cambridge]]\n\n===Eponymous institutions===\n*[[Girton Grammar School]], [[Bendigo, Victoria]], [[Australia]]\n*[[Girton Hall]], [[University of California, Berkeley]]\n\n===Official College Website===\n*[http://www.girton.cam.ac.uk/ Girton College]\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n; Books\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |title=Life at Girton College |last=a Girton student |author-link= |year=1882 |publisher=(no publisher) |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |access-date=}}\n*{{cite book |title = 'That Infidel Place'.

The college was established in 1869 by [[Emily Davies]] and [[Barbara Bodichon]] as the first [[women's college]] in Cambridge. In 1948, it was granted full college status by the university, marking the official admittance of women to the university. In 1976, it was the first Cambridge women's college to become [[mixed-sex education|coeducational]].\n\nThe main College site, situated on the outskirts of the village of [[Girton, Cambridgeshire|Girton]], about 2.5&nbsp;miles (4&nbsp;km) northwest of the university town, comprises {{convert|33|acre|ha|1}} of land. In a typical [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] red brick design, most was built by architect [[Alfred Waterhouse]] between 1872 and 1887. It provides extensive sports facilities, an indoor swimming pool, an award-winning library and a chapel with two organs. There is an accommodation annexe, known as Swirles Court, situated in the Eddington neighborhood of the [[North West Cambridge development]]. Swirles opened in 2017 and provides up to 325 en-suite single rooms for graduates, and for second-year undergraduates and above.\n\nThe College has several equal-access admittance schemes. It has a reputation for musical talent. Several art collections are held on the main site, including ''People's Portraits'', the millennial exhibition of the [[Royal Society of Portrait Painters]], and an Egyptian collection containing the world's most reproduced [[Fayum mummy portraits|portrait mummy]].\n\nAmong Girton's notable alumni are Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark]], [[President of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|UK Supreme Court President]] [[Brenda Hale, Baroness Hale of Richmond|Lady Hale]], ''[[HuffPost]]'' co-founder [[Arianna Huffington]], the comedian/author [[Sandi Toksvig]], the comedian/broadcaster/GP [[Phil Hammond (comedian)|Phil Hammond]], the economist [[Joan Robinson]], and the anthropologist [[Marilyn Strathern]], also Mistress from 1998 to 2009.\n\nIts [[sister college]] is [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville College]], one of the first two women's colleges of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Cambridge - Girton College Main Gate - June 2018.jpg|thumb|Main gate with porter's lodge]]\n\n===1869 to 1976: Pioneering for women's education===\nThe early feminist movement began to argue for the improvement of women's education in the 1860s<!--Mary Lyon opened Mount Holyoke for that purpose in 1837-->: [[Emily Davies]] and [[Barbara Bodichon]] met through their activism at the [[Society for Promoting the Employment of Women|Society for the Employment of Women]] and the [[Englishwoman's Review]].<ref>Stephen 1933, p.6</ref> They shared the aim of securing women's admission to university.<ref>Stephen 1933, p.7</ref> In particular, they wanted to determine whether girls could be admitted at Oxford or Cambridge to sit the Senior and Junior Local Examinations.<ref>Megson and Lindsay 1961, pp.1\u20132</ref> Davies and Bodichon set up a committee to that effect in 1862.

An Honours degree was considered more challenging than the Pass degree. In 1869, [[Henry Sidgwick]] helped institute the Examinations for Women, which was designed to be of intermediate difficulty.<ref>Winstanley 1977 p.154</ref> This idea was heavily opposed by Emily Davies, as she demanded admittance to the Tripos examinations.<ref>Stephen 1933, p.23</ref>\n\nThe college was established on 16 October 1869 under the name of the '''College for Women at Benslow House''' in [[Hitchin]], Hertfordshire, which was considered to be a convenient distance from Cambridge and London.<ref>Jones 1913, pp.16\u201317</ref> It was thought to be less \"risky\" and less controversial to locate the college away from Cambridge in the beginning.<ref>Stephen 1933, p.25</ref> The college was one of [[England]]'s first residential colleges for women.

Only one all-female corridor in which rooms were reserved exclusively for women remained. Upon the arrival of male undergraduates, [[Common Room (university)|JCR and MCR]] social facilities had to be enlarged.

No one likes us, but we don't care''!, in imitation of the [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] fans' famous song: ''[[No one likes us, we don't care]]''. The reference to ''no one likes us'' is supposedly due to the relative distance of Girton in comparison to many of the other colleges. In 2016 the Casual Choir performed ''Long Way to Girton College'', an adaptation of ''[[It's a Long Way to Tipperary]]'', written and arranged by two choir members.\n\nThe college song ''I love to go a-bicycling'', sung with the tune of'' I love to go a-wandering'' also alludes to Girton's 2.5 miles distance from the town centre. It has been sung since the 1960s.<ref name=\"College songs GC 2010\"/> For example, the second stanza reads:\n<blockquote><poem>But when I climb up Castle Hill\nIn the wind and squall\nA strong desire does then me fill\nTo be-e at [[Murray Edwards College, Cambridge|New Hall]].\n\n''Chorus:''\nFol-de-re, Fol-de-ra,\nFol-de-re, Fol-de-ra-a-a-a-\n.... To be-e at New Hall.<ref name=\"College songs GC 2010\"/></poem></blockquote>\n\nAnother song, composed in 1972 by [[Common Room (university)|JCR]] president Anna Cocconi,<ref name=\"College songs GC 2010\"/> is called ''Song to Wolfson Court''. The annexe of the college was opened in that year. Students often found fault with the modern architecture of the building, which was less spacious and elegant than the main site. The first two stanzas go as follows:\n<blockquote><poem> In a wheat field, west of Cambridge,\nOff a lane called Clarkson Road,\nWolfson Court is standing proudly;\nLet its story now be told\n\nHundred rooms with running water,\nCould you ever ask for more?\nNot unless you choose a boy-friend,\nMeas\u2019ring over five foot four!<ref name=\"College songs GC 2010\"/></poem></blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Girton College Boat Club]]\n* [[:Category:Alumni of Girton College, Cambridge]]\n* [[:Category:Fellows of Girton College, Cambridge]]\n\n===Eponymous institutions===\n*[[Girton Grammar School]], [[Bendigo, Victoria]], [[Australia]]\n*[[Girton Hall]], [[University of California, Berkeley]]\n\n===Official College Website===\n*[http://www.girton.cam.ac.uk/ Girton College]\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n; Books\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |title=Life at Girton College |last=a Girton student |author-link= |year=1882 |publisher=(no publisher) |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |access-date=}}\n*{{cite book |title = 'That Infidel Place'.
