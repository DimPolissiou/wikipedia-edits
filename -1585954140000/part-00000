Followers of these religions perceive behavior as being tightly connected with health; illnesses are often thought to be a result of moral failure or insufficiently honoring one's family in current or past life. Furthermore, an emphasis on social harmony may discourage people with mental illness from bringing attention to themselves and seeking help. They may also refuse to speak about their mental illness because of the shame it would bring upon themselves and their family members, who could also be held responsible and experience social isolation.\n\nAlso, reputation might be a factor that prevents individuals from seeking professional help.

In a Chinese household, every individual shares the responsibility of maintaining and raising the family's reputation. It is believed that mental health will hinder individuals from achieving the standards and goals- whether academic, social, career-based, or other- expected from parents. Without reaching the expectations, individuals are anticipated to bring shame to the family, which will affect the family's overall reputation. Therefore, mental health issues are seen as an unacceptable weakness. This perception of mental health disorders causes individuals to internalize their mental health problems, possibly worsening them, and making it difficult to seek treatment. Eventually, it becomes ignored and overlooked by families.\n\nIn addition, many of these philosophies teach followers to accept one's fate.<ref name=\":3\" /> Consequently, people with mental disorders may be less inclined to seek medical treatment because they believe they should not actively try to prevent any symptoms that may manifest.

For example, in the United States, it is estimated that about twenty-five percent of active military members suffer from a mental health problem, such as PTSD, Traumatic Brain Injury, and depression.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cox|first=Kenneth L.|last2=Ursano|first2=Robert J.|last3=Stein|first3=Murray B.|last4=Heeringa|first4=Steven G.|last5=Colpe|first5=Lisa J.|last6=Gilman|first6=Stephen E.|last7=Kessler|first7=Ronald C.|last8=Schoenbaum|first8=Michael|date=2014-05-01|title=Predictors of Suicide and Accident Death in the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS): Results From the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS)|journal=JAMA Psychiatry|language=en|volume=71|issue=5|pages=493\u2013503|doi=10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2013.4417|issn=2168-622X|pmc=4124912|pmid=24590048}}</ref> Currently, there are no clear initiatives from the government about mental health treatment towards military personnel in China.

''Acta Psychologica Sinica. 49(5),'' pp. 653-662</ref> The change of emphasis from physical health to mental health can be seen in China's four dominant military academic journals: First Military Journal Second Military Journal, Third Military Journal, and Fourth Military Journal. In the 1980s, researchers mostly focused on the physical health of soldiers, but as the troop's ability to perform their services declined, the government began looking toward on mental health to provide an explanation for this trend. In the 1990s, research on mental health increased with the hope that by improving the mental health of soldiers, combat effectiveness may also increase.<ref>Wang, X., He. X. (2015) Progress of Chinese Military Mental Health. ''J Third Mil Med Univ'', ''37(22)'' pp. 2213-2217   </ref>\n\nIn addition to impacting active military member's effectiveness in the army, mental health issues can create lasting effects affect them after they leave the military. Plateaus were an area of interest in this sense, because of the combination of harsh environmental conditions with low atmospheric pressure and intense UV radiation,<ref name=\":6\">Tan, Y., Li, Y., Wu, J., Chen, F., Lu, H., Lu, S., Yang, X., \u2026 Ma, X. (2018). Mental health of Automobile Transportation Troop personnel stationed in the Western Sichuan Plateau of China. ''Medicine'', ''97''(12),</ref> and the necessity of the work done there. It was critical to place the military there to stabilize the outskirts and protect the Chinese citizens who live nearby, thus making it one of the most important jobs in the army- and, subsequently, increasing the pressure on those who worked in the plateaus. The plateaus not only affect the body physically, like in the arteries, lungs, and back, but also caused high levels of depression in soldiers because of being from family members and with limited communication methods. Scientists found that this may impact their lives as they saw that this population had higher rates of divorce and lower rates of employment.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nComparatively, assessing the mental health status of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) is difficult, because military members work a diverse array of duties over a large landscape. In addition to combat, military members also play an active part in disaster relief, peacekeeping in foreign lands, protecting borders, and domestic riot control. In a study of 11,000 soldiers, researchers found that those who work as peacekeepers have higher levels of depression compared to those who work in the engineering and medical departments.<ref>Sun, X., Zhao, L., Chen, C., Cui, X., Guo, J., Zhang, L. (2014). Mental Health of Chinese Peacekeepers in Liberia''. Eur J. Psychiat  28, pg 77-85''   </ref> With such diverse military roles over an area of 3.25 million miles, it is difficult to gauge its impacts on soldiers\u2019 psyche and provide a single method to address mental health problems.\n\nAlthough researches have increased over the last two decades, the studies still lack a sense of comprehensiveness and reliability. Furthermore, in over 73 studies that together included 53,424 military members, some research shows that there is gradual improvement in mental health at high altitudes, such as mountain tops,<ref name=\":5\" /> but other researchers found that at higher altitudes, depressive symptoms can worsen.<ref>Feng Zhengzhi ,Qin, D.(2008) A Meta-Analysis Concerning the Mental Health Status of Members of the Chinese Army. ''Third Military Medical University. 40(03).'' pp. 358-367.</ref> These research studies demonstrate how difficult it is to assess and treat the mental illness that occurs in the army and how there are inconsistent results.  Furthermore, studies of the military population focus on the men of the military and exclude women in their studies, even though the number of women that are joining the military has increased in the last two decades.<ref name=\":7\">Chen H.H., Phillips, M.R., Cheng, H., Chen, Q.Q, Chen, X.D\u2026Bueber, M.

The study measured levels of anxious behaviors, symptoms of depression, sensitivity to traumatic events, resilience and emotional intelligence of existing personnel to aid the screening of new recruits.<ref name=\"Wang Y. 2012 pp. 420-4\"/> Similar research has been conducted into the external factors that impact a person's mental fortitude, including single-child status, urban or rural environment, and education level.<ref name=\":8\" /> Subsequently, the government has incorporated mental illness coping techniques into their training manual. In 2013 leak by the [[Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy|Tibetan Center for Human Rights]] of a small portion of the [[People's Liberation Army]] training manual from 2008, specifically concerned how military personnel could combat PTSD and depression while on peacekeeping missions in Tibet. The manual suggested that soldiers should: <blockquote>'''''\u201c...close [their] eyes and imagine zooming in on the scene like a camera [when experiencing PTSD]. It may feel uncomfortable. Then zoom all the way out until you cannot see anything. Then tell yourself the flashback is gone.\u201d'' <ref>Moore, M. (2013, May).

Without reaching the expectations, individuals are anticipated to bring shame to the family, which will affect the family's overall reputation. Therefore, mental health is an unacceptable weakness. This perception of mental health cause individuals to internalize their mental health problems. Eventually, it becomes ignored and overlooked by families.\n\nIn addition, many of these philosophies teach followers to accept one's fate.<ref name=\":3\" /> Consequently, people with mental disorders may be less inclined to seek medical treatment because they believe they should not actively try to prevent any symptoms that may manifest. They may also be less likely to question the stereotypes associated with people with mental illness, and instead agreeing with others that they deserve to be ostracized.\n\n===Lack of qualified staff===\nChina has 17,000 certified [[psychiatrist]]s, which is 10 percent of that of other developed countries per capita.<ref name=\"economist\">{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9657086|title=And now the 50-minute hour: Mental health in China|date=2007-08-18|accessdate=2007-08-18|newspaper=[[The Economist]]|pages=35}}</ref>  China averages one psychologist for every 83,000 people, and some of these psychologists are not board-licensed or certified to diagnose illnesses.

These doctors are one of the few modes of healthcare able to reach isolated parts of rural China, and are unable to obtain modern medical equipment, and therefore, reliable diagnoses for psychiatric illnesses. Furthermore, the nearest psychiatric clinic may be hundreds of kilometers away, and families may be unable to afford professional psychiatric treatment for the afflicted.\n\n=== Physical symptoms ===\nMultiple studies have found that Chinese patients with mental illness report more physical symptoms compared to Western patients, who tend to report more psychological symptoms.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Tsung-Yi|date=December 1983|title=Psychiatry and Chinese Culture|journal=Western Journal of Medicine|volume=139|issue=6|pages=862\u2013867|issn=0093-0415|pmc=1011017|pmid=6364576}}</ref> For example, Chinese patients with depression are more likely to report feelings of fatigue and muscle aches instead of feelings of depression.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ryder|first=Andrew|last2=Yang|first2=Jian|last3=Zhu|first3=Xiongzhao|last4=Yao|first4=Shuqiao|last5=Yi|first5=Jinyao|last6=Heine|first6=Steven|date=2008|title=The Cultural Shaping of Depression: Somatic Symptoms in China, Psychological Symptoms in North America?|series=|publisher=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|volume=117|pages=300\u201313|citeseerx=10.1.1.329.7641|doi=10.1037/0021-843x.117.2.300}}</ref> However, it is unclear whether this occurs because they feel more comfortable reporting physical symptoms or if depression manifests in a more physical way among Chinese people.\n\n== Chinese Military Mental Health ==\n\n=== Overview ===\nMilitary mental health has been an area of focus, particularly in Western countries. For example, in the United States, it is estimated that about twenty-five percent of active military members suffer from a mental health problem, such as PTSD, Traumatic Brain Injury and depression.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cox|first=Kenneth L.|last2=Ursano|first2=Robert J.|last3=Stein|first3=Murray B.|last4=Heeringa|first4=Steven G.|last5=Colpe|first5=Lisa J.|last6=Gilman|first6=Stephen E.|last7=Kessler|first7=Ronald C.|last8=Schoenbaum|first8=Michael|date=2014-05-01|title=Predictors of Suicide and Accident Death in the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS): Results From the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS)|journal=JAMA Psychiatry|language=en|volume=71|issue=5|pages=493\u2013503|doi=10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2013.4417|issn=2168-622X|pmc=4124912|pmid=24590048}}</ref> Although China's progress has been slow compared to their Western counterparts, the government has increased their efforts to address the mental health issues of their people.<ref name=\":4\">Xu, X., Li, X., Zhang, J., Wang, W., (2018) Mental Health-Related Stigma in China. ''Issues in Mental Health Nursing. 37(2)'' pp. 126-134</ref> China has also been focusing more resources on helping those with psychiatric problems, to promote both social order and harmony with the growing population and rising economy. Currently, there are no clear initiatives from the government about mental health treatment towards military personnel in China. Specifically, China has been investing in resources towards researching and understanding how the mental health needs of military members and producing policies to reinforce the research results.<ref name=\"Wang Y. 2012 pp. 420-4\">Wang Y., Zhang, L., Chen, C., Yao, G. (2012) Application of Chinese Military Health Scale in screening mental health of new recruits. ''Medical and Health Research Foundation of PLA.'' 37(5) pp. 420-4</ref>\n\n=== Background ===\n{{Copy edit section|date=February 2020}}\nResearch on the mental health status of active Chinese military men began in the 1980s, where psychologists began by investigating soldier's experiences out in the plateaus.<ref name=\":5\">Zhao, M., Feng, Z., Wang, F., Lai, W., Hu, F\u2026Xia, L. (2017). Chinese military mental health at high altitude, 1993-2013: A cross-temporal meta-analysis of SCL-90. ''Acta Psychologica Sinica. 49(5),'' pp. 653-662</ref> The change of emphasis from physical health to mental health can be seen in the four dominant military academic journals: First Military Journal, Second Military Journal, Third Military Journal, and Fourth Military Journal. In the 1980s, researchers mostly focused on the physical health of soldiers, but as the troop's ability to perform their services and the longevity of their services was declining, the government began looking toward on mental health to provide an explanation for this trend. In the 1990s, researches on mental health increased with the hope that by improving the mental health of soldiers, combat effectiveness may also increase.<ref>Wang, X., He. X. (2015) Progress of Chinese Military Mental Health. ''J Third Mil Med Univ'', ''37(22)'' pp. 2213-2217   </ref>\n\nIn addition, affecting active military member's work ethics, mental health can create lasting effects that continue to affect them after they leave the military. For example, researchers compiled all of the research articles from 1997 to 2007, with a sample size of 103,245 military members, about how working in the plateaus have affected soldiers when they resumed civilian life.<ref name=\":5\" /> Plateaus were an area of interest because the environmental conditions are harsh with low atmospheric pressure and intense UV radiation,<ref name=\":6\">Tan, Y., Li, Y., Wu, J., Chen, F., Lu, H., Lu, S., Yang, X., \u2026 Ma, X. (2018). Mental health of Automobile Transportation Troop personnel stationed in the Western Sichuan Plateau of China. ''Medicine'', ''97''(12),</ref> but it was critical to place the military there to stabilize the outskirts and protect the Chinese citizens who live near there. The plateaus not only affect the body physically, like in the arteries, lungs, and back, but also caused high levels of depression in soldiers because of being from family members and with limited communication methods. Scientists found that this may impact their lives as they saw that this population had higher rates of divorce and lower rates of employment.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nHowever, assessing the mental health status of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) is difficult because military members work a diverse array of duties over a large landscape. For example, in addition to combat, military members also play an active part in disaster relief, peacekeeping in foreign lands, protecting borders, domestic riot control, and more. In a study of 11,324 soldiers, researchers found that those who work as peacekeepers have higher levels of depression compared to those who work in the engineering and medical departments.<ref>Sun, X., Zhao, L., Chen, C., Cui, X., Guo, J., Zhang, L. (2014). Mental Health of Chinese Peacekeepers in Liberia''. Eur J. Psychiat  28, pg 77-85''   </ref> Environment also plays a factor in the manifestations of mental health symptoms. Most researches have concentrated mainly on plateaus, high altitudes, and other countries. With such diverse military roles over an area of 3.25 million miles, it is difficult to gauge its impacts on soldiers\u2019 psyche and provide a single method to address mental health problems.\n\nAlthough researches have increased over the last two decades, the studies still lack a sense of comprehensiveness and reliability. Furthermore, in over 73 studies that together included 53,424 military members, some research shows that there is gradual improvement in mental health at high altitudes, such as mountain tops,<ref name=\":5\" /> but other researchers found that at higher altitudes, depressive symptoms can worsen.<ref>Feng Zhengzhi ,Qin, D.(2008) A Meta-Analysis Concerning the Mental Health Status of Members of the Chinese Army. ''Third Military Medical University. 40(03).'' pp. 358-367.</ref> These research studies demonstrate how difficult it is to assess and treat the mental illness that occurs in the army and how there are inconsistent results.  Furthermore, studies of the military population focus on the men of the military and exclude women in their studies, even though the number of women that are joining the military has increased in the last two decades.<ref name=\":7\">Chen H.H., Phillips, M.R., Cheng, H., Chen, Q.Q, Chen, X.D\u2026Bueber, M.

The study measured levels of anxious behaviors, symptoms of depression, sensitivity to traumatic events, resilience and emotional intelligence of existing personnel to aid the screening of new recruits.<ref name=\"Wang Y. 2012 pp. 420-4\"/> Similar research has been conducted into the external factors that impact a person's mental fortitude, including single-child status, urban or rural environment, and education level.<ref name=\":8\" /> Subsequently, the government has incorporated mental illness coping techniques into their training manual. In 2013 leak by the [[Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy|Tibetan Center for Human Rights]] of a small portion of the [[People's Liberation Army]] training manual from 2008, specifically concerned how military personnel could combat PTSD and depression while on peacekeeping missions in Tibet. The manual suggested that soldiers should: <blockquote>'''''\u201c...close [their] eyes and imagine zooming in on the scene like a camera [when experiencing PTSD]. It may feel uncomfortable. Then zoom all the way out until you cannot see anything. Then tell yourself the flashback is gone.\u201d'' <ref>Moore, M. (2013, May). Chinese troops suffering post-traumatic stress disorder in Tibet. ''The Telegraph.'' Retrieved from <nowiki>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/tibet/10071121/Chinese-troops-suffering-post-traumatic-stress-disorder-in-Tibet.html</nowiki></ref>''' </blockquote>In 2012, the government specifically addressed military mental health in a legal document for the first time. In article 84 of the Mental Health Law of the People's Republic of China, it stated, \u201c''The State Council and the Central Military Committee will formulate regulations based on this law to manage mental health work in the military.''\"<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nBesides screening, assessments and an excerpt of the manual, not much is known about the services that are provided to active military members and veterans. Analysis of more than 45 different studies, moreover, has deemed that the level of anxiety in current and ex-military personnel has increased despite efforts of the People's Republic due to economic conditions, lack of social connects and the feeling of a threat to military livelihood.<ref name=\":9\">Yang, Z., Cao, F., Lu, H., Zhu, X., Miao, D.
