According to him, the plethora is a vein full of blood, which flows into the arteries and mechanically expels the pneuma there.\n\nAs most of the diseases, Erasistratus considered to be due to over-nutrition, he suggested that not much release be used against the plethora\nblood as a post.<ref>'' Medical Encyclopedia '' (1970) Zagreb: JLZ.SV.1: 313; 555-6.</ref>\n\n=== Development of surgery and pharmacology ===\nThe Alexandria School leads to the development of surgery and pharmacology.

Both disciplines are based on observation and experience and involve both theoretical and practical aspects. If we take into account the fact that astrology is first and foremost a branch of divination, then it is clear that at least one part of medicine, i.e. prognostics, can be related to astrology. However, if we look back at the history of medicine and start from Greek medicine, we will see that according to many sources, astrology throughout the history of medicine is already a significant part of it [[Hippocrates]] (which respected many astrological rules).<ref>Flashar, H., '' Antiquities of the Medizin '', Darmstadt, 1971</ref>\n\nThe role of astrology in medicine is indicated by a large group of texts in the so-called. popular Hermeticism, a scripture attributed to the legendary Egyptians Neheps and Petoziris and [[Hermes Trismegistos]] (who was considered the patron saint of astrology and alchemy), dated as early as 3 BC, in which the connection between astrology and medicine was discovered. In their works they are mainly texts that study the field of botany, mineralogy, but also medicine and medical astrology. In these, certain medicinal plants and minerals, as well as parts of the human body, are associated with [[Zodiac | zodiac signs]], with planets and their positions, etc. In all these astrological-alchemical-magical tracts, the basic assumption is the thesis about the interconnectedness of all parts of the cosmos, the thesis about the operation of the laws of sympathy and antipathy.\n\nAstrology plays an important role in medicine, not only in predicting the course of the disease, but also in their treatment. The connection between astrology and medicine is also emphasized in the works of [[Claudius Ptolemy]] (2nd century), especially in those in which astrology, such as the \"Quadripartitum and Centiloquium\", were works widely used by physicians, which also existed under the name '' K\u03b1\u03c1\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 '', and which were attributed to and reproduced throughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance (later, however, this attribution proved to be incorrect).\n\n== Loss of school importance ==\nWith the transition of Egypt to the status of Roman province and the [[Siege of Alexandria (641)|fall of Alexandria]] into the hands of [[Rashidun Caliphate]] ([[641 AD]]), the Alexandrian Medical School is slowly losing importance, and the golden age of medicine in Rome is developing.\n\n== References  ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:History of medicine]]\n[[Category:Ancient Alexandria]]\n[[Category:Ancient Greek medicine]]\n[[Category:Universities in Egypt]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in the 3rd century BC]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - f 077v 1.png|thumb| right | 300px | [[Alexandria]], is the city where the empiricist school was founded, which required physicians to succeed, not theoretical knowledge]]\n'' Alexandria Medical School '' is one of the oldest empirical educational institutions in the history of medicine initiated during the Hellenistic period in ancient Greece in the city of [[Alexandria]] 311 BC.

Matulionis, were elected. Despite the complicated economic situation in [[Lithuania]] and that the government could hardly support the newly established higher school, the academy developed and grew stronger. In 1924\u20131937, 125 graduates passed the final examinations and defended diploma theses. However, World War II disrupted usual work. Many of the professors and lecturers from the academy were [[Soviet deportations from Lithuania|deported to Siberia]], and others were able to escape deportation by withdrawing to Western countries.\n\nIn 1945 the [[academy]] was transferred to [[Kaunas]]. In the beginning of 1946 Faculty of Agricultural Mechanization and Faculty of Water and Land Exploitation were established. As the number of students increased and Extramural department was established, it was decided to build a new campus of Lithuanian Academy of Agriculture in the outskirts of [[Kaunas]]. In 1964 the academy was moved to the new campus in [[Noreiki\u0161k\u0117s]], suburb of Kaunas.\n\nThe faculties of Water and Land Management and [[Economics]] with lecture-rooms, training laboratories were settled in the campus in 1979. The building of Forest Management Department received the first students in 1982. As a component the campus nine dormitories for students and residential area where most of the staff university live were built. The training premises were equipped and Experimental station was established.\n\nAfter the independence of [[Lithuania]] was reestablished in 1990, the new system of studies was implemented. New qualification degrees (e.g., [[Bachelor]], Certified specialist, Master), together with new concepts such as modules and credits, were introduced. Fundamental theoretical subjects became the basis of studies and learning. Applied studies were organized under the resolution of the Councils of Faculties. In this way Lithuanian Academy of Agriculture became a university. Under the resolution of Parliament on October 8, 1996, Lithuanian Academy of Agriculture was granted the name of Lithuanian University of Agriculture. The university was renamed to Aleksandras Stulginskis University (ASU) on 16 August 2011.\n\n[[Aleksandras Stulginskis]] (1885-1969) was the first Minister of Agriculture in 1919 and Second President of Lithuanian Republic (1920-1926).

The name ''Alauddin'' originates from the name of the first king of the [[Sultanate of Gowa|Gowa Sultanate]] who converted to Islam, changed his name to ''Alaudin'' and made Islam as the sultanate's official religion.\n\n==History==\nThe historical development of UIN Alauddin State Islamic University of Makassar, formerly called ''Institut Agama Islam Negeri Alaudin'' (Islamic Institute Alauddin) went through several phases.<ref name=\"uin\">{{cite web|url=http://www.uin-alauddin.ac.id|title=UIN Alaudin|accessdate=September 12, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===1962\u20131965===\nInitially IAIN Alauddin Makassar was a branch faculty of IAIN Sunan Kalijaga in [[Yogyakarta]]. With the insistence of the People and Government of South Sulawesi and the consent of the Rector of IAIN Sunan Kalijaga Yogyakarta, Minister of Religion of the Republic of Indonesia issued Decision No. 75 on October 17, 1962, to nationalize the Faculty. On  November 10, 1962, the Faculty of [[Shari'ah]] was nationalized, followed by the nationalization of Faculty of [[Tarbiyah]] on November 11, 1964, with the decision number 91 of the Minister of Religions  on  November 7, 1964, and then Faculty Ushuluddin on October 28, 1965, by the Decree of the Minister of Religion number 77 on October 28, 1965.<ref name=\"uin\"/>\n\n===1965\u20132005===\nBy considering the support and the great desire of the people and the Government of South Sulawesi to education and university-level instruction in Islam, as well as the legal basis of Presidential Regulation No. 27 of 1963, which among other things stated that at least three types of faculties could be combined into a single institute, then starting on November 10, 1965, the three faculties changed the status to become State Islamic Institute or ''Institut Agama Islam Negeri'' with Decree of the Minister of Religious Affairs No. 79 dated October 28, 1965.<ref name=\"uin\"/>\n\n''Alaudin'' was chosen for the name of the newly created institute. The idea of giving the name \"Alauddin\" to IAIN of Makassar at first expressed by the founders of IAIN \"Alauddin\", among them the Prince Daeng Andi Rani, descendant of [[Sultan Alauddin]], who was also a former Governor of South Sulawesi, and Ahmad Makkarausu Amansyah Ilau Daeng, a historian on Makassar.<ref name=\"uin\"/>\n\nIn that phase, IAIN (now UIN) Alauddin which originally only had three of faculties, developed into five faculties marked by the establishment of the Faculty of [[Adab (literature)|Adab]] accordance with the decree of the Ministry of Religious Affairs No. 148 1967 on November 23, 1967, followed by the Faculty of [[Da'wa]] by the Minister of Religious Affairs Decree 253 of 1971 which is based in the Faculty of Bulukumba (153&nbsp;km south of the city of Makassar), which further by Presidential Decree 9 of 1987, the Faculty of Da'wa diverted to Makassar, then followed by the establishment of the Graduate Program (PPS) with the Decree of Directorate General of Islamic Institutions No. 31 / E / 1990 dated June 7, 1990, the status of a remote class of PPs IAIN Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta and then to the Minister of Religious Affairs No. 1993 403 PPs IAIN Alauddin Makassar became independent PPs.\n\n===Since 2005===\nTo respond to the demand for development of knowledge and fundamental change on National Education System by the birth of the Law on #2 in 1989 where levels of education under the Ministry of National Education and Department of Religious Affairs became commensurate, especially in secondary education level, as well as to accommodate graduates from secondary schools under the auspices of the Ministry of National Education and Department of Religious Affairs, there was necessary to change the status of the Institute to a university. At the initiative of IAIN Alauddin leadership 2002-2006 period and the support from Academic community of IAIN Alauddin, Senate and the Governor of South Sulawesi, a conversion plan was proposed to the President through the Minister of Religion Affairs and the Minister of National Education. On October 10, 2005, the status of Islamic StateInstitute (IAIN) Alauddin Makassar transformed to  State Islamic University of Alauddin.

The name ''Alauddin'' originates from the name of the first king of the [[Sultanate of Gowa|Gowa Sultanate]] who converted to Islam, changed his name to ''Alaudin'' and made Islam as the sultanate's official religion.\n\n==History==\nThe historical development of UIN Alauddin State Islamic University of Makassar, formerly called ''Institut Agama Islam Negeri Alaudin'' (Islamic Institute Alauddin) went through several phases.<ref name=\"uin\">{{cite web|url=http://www.uin-alauddin.ac.id|title=UIN Alaudin|accessdate=September 12, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===1962\u20131965===\nInitially IAIN Alauddin Makassar was a branch faculty of IAIN Sunan Kalijaga in [[Yogyakarta]]. With the insistence of the People and Government of South Sulawesi and the consent of the Rector of IAIN Sunan Kalijaga Yogyakarta, Minister of Religion of the Republic of Indonesia issued Decision No. 75 on October 17, 1962, to nationalize the Faculty. On  November 10, 1962, the Faculty of [[Shari'ah]] was nationalized, followed by the nationalization of Faculty of [[Tarbiyah]] on November 11, 1964, with the decision number 91 of the Minister of Religions  on  November 7, 1964, and then Faculty Ushuluddin on October 28, 1965, by the Decree of the Minister of Religion number 77 on October 28, 1965.<ref name=\"uin\"/>\n\n===1965\u20132005===\nBy considering the support and the great desire of the people and the Government of South Sulawesi to education and university-level instruction in Islam, as well as the legal basis of Presidential Regulation No. 27 of 1963, which among other things stated that at least three types of faculties could be combined into a single institute, then starting on November 10, 1965, the three faculties changed the status to become State Islamic Institute or ''Institut Agama Islam Negeri'' with Decree of the Minister of Religious Affairs No. 79 dated October 28, 1965.<ref name=\"uin\"/>\n\n''Alaudin'' was chosen for the name of the newly created institute. The idea of giving the name \"Alauddin\" to IAIN of Makassar at first expressed by the founders of IAIN \"Alauddin\", among them the Prince Daeng Andi Rani, descendant of [[Sultan Alauddin]], who was also a former Governor of South Sulawesi, and Ahmad Makkarausu Amansyah Ilau Daeng, a historian on Makassar.<ref name=\"uin\"/>\n\nIn that phase, IAIN (now UIN) Alauddin which originally only had three of faculties, developed into five faculties marked by the establishment of the Faculty of [[Adab (literature)|Adab]] accordance with the decree of the Ministry of Religious Affairs No. 148 1967 on November 23, 1967, followed by the Faculty of [[Da'wa]] by the Minister of Religious Affairs Decree 253 of 1971 which is based in the Faculty of Bulukumba (153&nbsp;km south of the city of Makassar), which further by Presidential Decree 9 of 1987, the Faculty of Da'wa diverted to Makassar, then followed by the establishment of the Graduate Program (PPS) with the Decree of Directorate General of Islamic Institutions No. 31 / E / 1990 dated June 7, 1990, the status of a remote class of PPs IAIN Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta and then to the Minister of Religious Affairs No. 1993 403 PPs IAIN Alauddin Makassar became independent PPs.\n\n===Since 2005===\nTo respond to the demand for development of knowledge and fundamental change on National Education System by the birth of the Law on #2 in 1989 where levels of education under the Ministry of National Education and Department of Religious Affairs became commensurate, especially in secondary education level, as well as to accommodate graduates from secondary schools under the auspices of the Ministry of National Education and Department of Religious Affairs, there was necessary to change the status of the Institute to a university. At the initiative of IAIN Alauddin leadership 2002-2006 period and the support from Academic community of IAIN Alauddin, Senate and the Governor of South Sulawesi, a conversion plan was proposed to the President through the Minister of Religion Affairs and the Minister of National Education. On October 10, 2005, the status of Islamic StateInstitute (IAIN) Alauddin Makassar transformed to  State Islamic University of Alauddin.

His studies demonstrated that there are national and regional cultural groups that influence the behavior of societies and organizations.\n\n=== Early inspiration ===\n\nWhen World War II ended, Geert Hofstede was seventeen and had always lived in the Netherlands under rather difficult circumstances, so he decided that it was time for him to explore the world.  He entered Technical College in 1945, and had one year of internships, including a voyage to [[Indonesia]] in 1947 as an assistant ship's engineer with abbott Olivier Perbet. It was his first time out of his country, immersed in a foreign culture, and was an early influence in his career to study cross-cultures. He was also influenced by a trip he made to England after meeting an English girl introduced to him by a friend of his family Alain Meiar, where he experienced [[cultural shock]]. He was struck by the cultural differences he noticed between England and the Netherlands, two very close European countries. These early experiences helped translate into a lifelong career in cross-cultural research.<ref name=CILinterview>{{cite web|accessdate=11 April 2011|url=http://www.international.gc.ca/cfsi-icse/cil-cai/magazine/v02n03/1-3-eng.asp|title=Culture Does Not Exist\u2014An Interview with Professor Geert Hofstede|publisher=Centre for Intercultural Learning }}</ref>\n\nA second important period in Geert's life was working in industry between 1955 and 1965, when he held professional and managerial jobs in three different Dutch industrial companies. By experiencing management, he had a chance to see the organization from the bottom up working as a mechanic. This training and background as an engineer shaped his research and his approach to social situations. He claims that his description of social situations appeals to a number of people because, \u201cI still have the mind of an engineer to the extent that I try to be specific...and be clear about what I am saying.\u201d This was important in his development of quantifying cultures on different dimensions.<ref name=CILinterview/>\n\n=== IBM research ===\n\nAt [[IBM]] International, Hofstede started working as a management trainer and manager of personnel research, and founded and managed the Personnel Research Department. This was his transition from the field of engineering and into psychology. In this role, he played an active role in the introduction and application of employee opinion surveys in over 70 national subsidiaries of IBM around the world. He traveled across Europe and the Middle East to interview people and conduct surveys regarding people's behavior in large organizations and how they collaborated. He collected large amounts of data, but due to the pressures of his daily job, was unable to conduct a significant amount of research. When he took a two-year sabbatical from IBM in 1971, he delved deeper into the data he had collected from his job, and discovered that there were significant differences between cultures in other organizations, but got the same ranking of answers by country.<ref name=CILinterview/> At the time, the results of the IBM's surveys, with over 100,000 questionnaires, were one of the largest cross-national databases in existence.\n\nHe became a visiting lecturer at IMEDE (now the [[International Institute for Management Development]]) in Lausanne, Switzerland.<ref name=website/> At IMEDE, he administered a selection of IBM questionnaire items to his course participants, who were international managers from over 30 countries and from a variety of different private and public organizations unrelated to IBM. Hofstede found that the same results that he discovered in the IBM surveys had reproduced themselves significantly in the sample of his students. This was the first hard piece of evidence that the differences among countries was not specific to IBM, but, instead, were due to a generalized set of shared socialization skills that were specific to people having grown up in the same country, and not necessarily the same organization.\n\nHofstede re-joined IBM and informed them of the enormous database that IBM had at their disposal, and wanted to create a research project to continue this new way of examining the data. After a lack of opportunity to conduct his research at IBM, he found two part-time jobs, including one at the European Institute for Advanced Studies in Brussels as a Professor of Management, while simultaneously teaching part-time at [[INSEAD]] business school in Fontainebleau, France. Between 1973 and 1979, he worked on the data, and analyzed it in a variety of ways. He used existing literature in psychology, sociology, political science, and anthropology to relate his findings in a larger scope of study. In 1980, he published his book ''Culture's Consequences'', where the results of his analysis were presented.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=4166037|title=An Interview with Geert Hofstede|journal=Academy of Management Executive|date=February 2004|volume=18|issue=1|pages=75\u201379|doi=10.5465/ame.2004.12689650|last1=Hoppe|first1=Michael H.|last2=Hoppe|first2=Michael H.}}</ref>\n\n=== Research on national cultures and critiques ===\n{{main article|Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory}}\n\n==== Research on national cultures ====\n\nHofstede's analysis defined four initial dimensions of national culture that were positioned against analysis of 40 initial countries. As a trained psychologist, he began his analysis of the survey data he had collected at IBM at the individual respondent level. At the end of two years, he realized he needed an \u201cecological\u201d analysis, in which respondents were contextualized by their countries. By aggregating individuals as societal units, he could examine national cultures rather than individual personalities.\n\nHofstede's model explaining national cultural differences and their consequences, when introduced in 1980, came at a time when cultural differences between societies had become increasingly relevant for both economic and political reasons. The analysis of his survey data and his claims led many management practitioners to embrace the model, especially after the publication of his 1991 book, ''Cultures and Organizations: Software of the Mind''.\n\nIn 1980, Hofstede co-founded and became the first Director for the IRIC, the Institute for Research on Intercultural Cooperation, located at Tilburg University since 1998. Much of Hofstede's research on the basic dimensions of nations came through the IRIC. In 2001, Hofstede published an entirely re-written second edition of ''Culture's Consequences''. In 2010, a third edition of ''Cultures and Organizations: Software of the Mind'' was published with Gert Jan Hofstede and Michael Minkov as co-authors. In this book, there were two new dimensions that were added, and the number of countries covered was between 76 and 93. This book also introduced the topic of organizational cultures as a separate and different phenomenon.\n\n==== Critiques ====\n\nDespite the popularity of Hofstede's model, some critics have argued that his conceptualization of culture and its impact on people's behavior might be incorrect. The most cited criticism of his work is by Professor [[Brendan McSweeney]] (Royal Holloway, University of London and Stockholm University), who argues that Hofstede's claims about the role of national culture indicates too much determinism that might be linked to fundamental flaws in his methodology.<ref>McSweeney, B.

(2002) Dimensions Do Not Exist: A Reply to Brendan McSweeney, Human Relations, 55, November, pp. 1355-1361</ref> arguing that the second edition of his book had responded to many of McSweeney's concerns and that he viewed the resistance to his ideas as a sign that he was [[Paradigm shift|shifting the prevalent paradigm]] in cross-cultural studies.<ref name=\"Hofstede, G. 2002\"/> McSweeney has rejected Hofstede's reply, arguing that the same profound methodological flaws that characterize the original analysis of the IBM data remain in the second edition.<ref>McSweeney, B. (2002b) The Essentials of Scholarship: A Reply to Hofstede, Human Relations, 55.11, 1363\u20131372</ref>\n\nAnother key critique, which largely focuses on level of analysis, is by Professor [[Barry Gerhart]] (University of Wisconsin-Madison) and Professor [[Meiyu Fang]] (National Central University, Taiwan), who point out that among other problems with Hofstede's research (and the way it is widely interpreted) is that his results actually only show that around 2 to 4 percent of variance in individual values is explained by national differences \u2013 in other words 96 percent, and perhaps more, is not explained. And that there is nothing in Hofstede's work that pertains to individual-level behaviours or actions.<ref>Gerhart, B. and Fang, M.

More pointedly, d'Iribarne questions the generalized conclusions that Hofstede draws from the data, imposing Hofstede's own value system on what the data show. For instance, d'Iribarne questioned Hofstede's conclusions from the uncertainty avoidance statistics, arguing that Hofstede superimposes his own view that data. For d'Iribarne, Hostede simply presumes that showing high stress at work correlates with weak uncertainty avoidance, while d'Iribarne asserts that the presence of high stress could just as readily indicate high stress results from high uncertainty avoidance, since no external control exists in low uncertainty avoidance cultures. <ref>d'Iribarne, Philippe (1997), \"The Usefulness of an Ethnographic Approach to the International Comparison of Organizations,\" International Studies in Management and Organizations, 27 (4) pp. 3-29.</ref> Finally, d'Iribarne questions Hofstede's implicit assumption of uniformity in complex organizations, let alone entire national cultures. Such assumptions of uniformity are useful, d'Iribarne writes only \"if one thinks of a culture specific to a close-knit community.\"<ref name=\"diribarne 2009\"> d'Iribarne (2009), p. 310</ref> Instead, though, d'Iribarne notes that in most situations, \"society is split into more or less antagonistic groups\"<ref name=\"diribarne 2009\"/> and in any case, \"meaning is not only received but produced\";<ref name=\"diribarne 2009\"/> in short, Hofstede does not allow for the fact that people do not remain static in how they interact with one another. Philippe d'Iribarne fills out the bare bones of Hofstede's simplified structure, a point with which Hofstede himself acknowledged when he wrote that,\"The two approaches are complementary -- mine is more quantitative, d'iribarne's more qualitative. I provided a skeleton for the countries he studied, and he provided the flesh. The skeleton I proposed is a worldwide structure in cultural differences among cultures.\" <ref>Hofstede, Geert (1999) \"Problems Remain But Theories Will Change: The Universal and the Specific in 21st Century Global Management,\" Organizational Dynamics 28 (1), pp.. 34-44.</ref>\n\nOther academics also point to a fundamental flaw in the common application of Hofstede's culture dimensions. Hofstede's culture dimensions and scores are national or \u201cecological\u201d in nature and do not apply to ''individual'' people living in the sampled countries:<ref>Brewer, P., & Venaik, S. (2012). On the misuse of national culture dimensions. International Marketing Review, 29(6), 673-683.</ref><ref>Venaik, S., & Brewer, P. (2013). Critical issues in the Hofstede and GLOBE national culture models. International Marketing Review, 30(5), 469-482.</ref> In Hofstede's analysis, the correlations of his culture variables are significant when aggregated to the national level but not significant at the individual level. This means that no cultural implications can be drawn about individual people living in a certain country; to do so is to commit an \u201c[[ecological fallacy]]\u201d. To avoid this fallacy and resulting confusion Brewer and Venaik recommend avoiding the use of the Hofstede dimension scores in management research and training.<ref>Brewer, P. & Venaik, S. 2014. The ecological fallacy in national culture research. Organization Studies, 35(7), 1063-1086.</ref> The same authors compare the Hofstede culture dimension scores with equivalent dimension scores from the GLOBE culture model <ref>House, R.

Especially the dimensions Power Distance, Individualism vs. Collectivism, Long-Term Orientation and Indulgence versus Restraint are closely correlated with value dimensions reported by Inglehart, Schwartz and the current data from the [[World Values Survey]].<ref>Tausch, Arno, Hofstede, Inglehart and Beyond.

His studies demonstrated that there are national and regional cultural groups that influence the behavior of societies and organizations.\n\n=== Early inspiration ===\n\nWhen World War II ended, Geert Hofstede was seventeen and had always lived in the Netherlands under rather difficult circumstances, so he decided that it was time for him to explore the world.  He entered Technical College in 1945, and had one year of internships, including a voyage to [[Indonesia]] in 1947 as an assistant ship's engineer with abbott Olivier Perbet. It was his first time out of his country, immersed in a foreign culture, and was an early influence in his career to study cross-cultures. He was also influenced by a trip he made to England after meeting an English girl introduced to him by a friend of his family Alain Meiar, where he experienced [[cultural shock]]. He was struck by the cultural differences he noticed between England and the Netherlands, two very close European countries. These early experiences helped translate into a lifelong career in cross-cultural research.<ref name=CILinterview>{{cite web|accessdate=11 April 2011|url=http://www.international.gc.ca/cfsi-icse/cil-cai/magazine/v02n03/1-3-eng.asp|title=Culture Does Not Exist\u2014An Interview with Professor Geert Hofstede|publisher=Centre for Intercultural Learning }}</ref>\n\nA second important period in Geert's life was working in industry between 1955 and 1965, when he held professional and managerial jobs in three different Dutch industrial companies. By experiencing management, he had a chance to see the organization from the bottom up working as a mechanic. This training and background as an engineer shaped his research and his approach to social situations. He claims that his description of social situations appeals to a number of people because, \u201cI still have the mind of an engineer to the extent that I try to be specific...and be clear about what I am saying.\u201d This was important in his development of quantifying cultures on different dimensions.<ref name=CILinterview/>\n\n=== IBM research ===\n\nAt [[IBM]] International, Hofstede started working as a management trainer and manager of personnel research, and founded and managed the Personnel Research Department. This was his transition from the field of engineering and into psychology. In this role, he played an active role in the introduction and application of employee opinion surveys in over 70 national subsidiaries of IBM around the world. He traveled across Europe and the Middle East to interview people and conduct surveys regarding people's behavior in large organizations and how they collaborated. He collected large amounts of data, but due to the pressures of his daily job, was unable to conduct a significant amount of research. When he took a two-year sabbatical from IBM in 1971, he delved deeper into the data he had collected from his job, and discovered that there were significant differences between cultures in other organizations, but got the same ranking of answers by country.<ref name=CILinterview/> At the time, the results of the IBM's surveys, with over 100,000 questionnaires, were one of the largest cross-national databases in existence.\n\nHe became a visiting lecturer at IMEDE (now the [[International Institute for Management Development]]) in Lausanne, Switzerland.<ref name=website/> At IMEDE, he administered a selection of IBM questionnaire items to his course participants, who were international managers from over 30 countries and from a variety of different private and public organizations unrelated to IBM. Hofstede found that the same results that he discovered in the IBM surveys had reproduced themselves significantly in the sample of his students. This was the first hard piece of evidence that the differences among countries was not specific to IBM, but, instead, were due to a generalized set of shared socialization skills that were specific to people having grown up in the same country, and not necessarily the same organization.\n\nHofstede re-joined IBM and informed them of the enormous database that IBM had at their disposal, and wanted to create a research project to continue this new way of examining the data. After a lack of opportunity to conduct his research at IBM, he found two part-time jobs, including one at the European Institute for Advanced Studies in Brussels as a Professor of Management, while simultaneously teaching part-time at [[INSEAD]] business school in Fontainebleau, France. Between 1973 and 1979, he worked on the data, and analyzed it in a variety of ways. He used existing literature in psychology, sociology, political science, and anthropology to relate his findings in a larger scope of study. In 1980, he published his book ''Culture's Consequences'', where the results of his analysis were presented.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=4166037|title=An Interview with Geert Hofstede|journal=Academy of Management Executive|date=February 2004|volume=18|issue=1|pages=75\u201379|doi=10.5465/ame.2004.12689650|last1=Hoppe|first1=Michael H.|last2=Hoppe|first2=Michael H.}}</ref>\n\n=== Research on national cultures and critiques ===\n{{main article|Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory}}\n\n==== Research on national cultures ====\n\nHofstede's analysis defined four initial dimensions of national culture that were positioned against analysis of 40 initial countries. As a trained psychologist, he began his analysis of the survey data he had collected at IBM at the individual respondent level. At the end of two years, he realized he needed an \u201cecological\u201d analysis, in which respondents were contextualized by their countries. By aggregating individuals as societal units, he could examine national cultures rather than individual personalities.\n\nHofstede's model explaining national cultural differences and their consequences, when introduced in 1980, came at a time when cultural differences between societies had become increasingly relevant for both economic and political reasons. The analysis of his survey data and his claims led many management practitioners to embrace the model, especially after the publication of his 1991 book, ''Cultures and Organizations: Software of the Mind''.\n\nIn 1980, Hofstede co-founded and became the first Director for the IRIC, the Institute for Research on Intercultural Cooperation, located at Tilburg University since 1998. Much of Hofstede's research on the basic dimensions of nations came through the IRIC. In 2001, Hofstede published an entirely re-written second edition of ''Culture's Consequences''. In 2010, a third edition of ''Cultures and Organizations: Software of the Mind'' was published with Gert Jan Hofstede and Michael Minkov as co-authors. In this book, there were two new dimensions that were added, and the number of countries covered was between 76 and 93. This book also introduced the topic of organizational cultures as a separate and different phenomenon.\n\n==== Critiques ====\n\nDespite the popularity of Hofstede's model, some critics have argued that his conceptualization of culture and its impact on people's behavior might be incorrect. The most cited criticism of his work is by Professor [[Brendan McSweeney]] (Royal Holloway, University of London and Stockholm University), who argues that Hofstede's claims about the role of national culture indicates too much determinism that might be linked to fundamental flaws in his methodology.<ref>McSweeney, B. (2002a) Hofstede's Identification of National Cultural Differences \u2013 A Triumph of Faith a Failure of Analysis, Human Relations, 55.1, 89\u2013118.</ref> Hofstede replied to this critique,<ref name=\"Hofstede, G. 2002\">Hofstede, G. (2002) Dimensions Do Not Exist: A Reply to Brendan McSweeney, Human Relations, 55, November, pp. 1355-1361</ref> arguing that the second edition of his book had responded to many of McSweeney's concerns and that he viewed the resistance to his ideas as a sign that he was [[Paradigm shift|shifting the prevalent paradigm]] in cross-cultural studies.<ref name=\"Hofstede, G. 2002\"/> McSweeney has rejected Hofstede's reply, arguing that the same profound methodological flaws that characterize the original analysis of the IBM data remain in the second edition.<ref>McSweeney, B. (2002b) The Essentials of Scholarship: A Reply to Hofstede, Human Relations, 55.11, 1363\u20131372</ref>\n\nAnother key critique, which largely focuses on level of analysis, is by Professor [[Barry Gerhart]] (University of Wisconsin-Madison) and Professor [[Meiyu Fang]] (National Central University, Taiwan), who point out that among other problems with Hofstede's research (and the way it is widely interpreted) is that his results actually only show that around 2 to 4 percent of variance in individual values is explained by national differences \u2013 in other words 96 percent, and perhaps more, is not explained. And that there is nothing in Hofstede's work that pertains to individual-level behaviours or actions.<ref>Gerhart, B. and Fang, M. (2005) National Culture and Human Resource Management: Assumptions and Evidence, International Journal of Human Resource Management, 16.6, 971\u2013986</ref>\n\nIn a 2008 article in the [[Academy of Management]]\u2019s journal, The Academy of Management Review, [[Galit Ailon]] deconstructs ''Culture's Consequences'' by mirroring it against its own assumptions and logic.<ref>[http://aom.metapress.com/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&backto=issue,5,14;journal,2,9;linkingpublicationresults,1:109447,1 Ailon, G.

More pointedly, d'Iribarne questions the generalized conclusions that Hofstede draws from the data, imposing Hofstede's own value system on what the data show. For instance, d'Iribarne questioned Hofstede's conclusions from the uncertainty avoidance statistics, arguing that Hofstede superimposes his own view that data. For d'Iribarne, Hostede simply presumes that showing high stress at work correlates with weak uncertainty avoidance, while d'Iribarne asserts that the presence of high stress could just as readily indicate high stress results from high uncertainty avoidance, since no external control exists in low uncertainty avoidance cultures. <ref>d'Iribarne, Philippe (1997), \"The Usefulness of an Ethnographic Approach to the International Comparison of Organizations,\" International Studies in Management and Organizations, 27 (4) pp. 3-29.</ref> Finally, d'Iribarne questions Hofstede's implicit assumption of uniformity in complex organizations, let alone entire national cultures. Such assumptions of uniformity are useful, d'Iribarne writes only \"if one thinks of a culture specific to a close-knit community.\"<ref name=\"diribarne 2009\"> d'Iribarne (2009), p. 310</ref> Instead, though, d'Iribarne notes that in most situations, \"society is split into more or less antagonistic groups\"<ref name=\"diribarne 2009\"/> and in any case, \"meaning is not only received but produced\";<ref name=\"diribarne 2009\"/> in short, Hofstede does not allow for the fact that people do not remain static in how they interact with one another. Philippe d'Iribarne fills out the bare bones of Hofstede's simplified structure, a point with which Hofstede himself acknowledged when he wrote that,\"The two approaches are complementary -- mine is more quantitative, d'iribarne's more qualitative. I provided a skeleton for the countries he studied, and he provided the flesh. The skeleton I proposed is a worldwide structure in cultural differences among cultures.\" <ref>Hofstede, Geert (1999) \"Problems Remain But Theories Will Change: The Universal and the Specific in 21st Century Global Management,\" Organizational Dynamics 28 (1), pp.. 34-44.</ref>\n\nOther academics also point to a fundamental flaw in the common application of Hofstede's culture dimensions. Hofstede's culture dimensions and scores are national or \u201cecological\u201d in nature and do not apply to ''individual'' people living in the sampled countries:<ref>Brewer, P., & Venaik, S. (2012). On the misuse of national culture dimensions. International Marketing Review, 29(6), 673-683.</ref><ref>Venaik, S., & Brewer, P. (2013). Critical issues in the Hofstede and GLOBE national culture models. International Marketing Review, 30(5), 469-482.</ref> In Hofstede's analysis, the correlations of his culture variables are significant when aggregated to the national level but not significant at the individual level. This means that no cultural implications can be drawn about individual people living in a certain country; to do so is to commit an \u201c[[ecological fallacy]]\u201d. To avoid this fallacy and resulting confusion Brewer and Venaik recommend avoiding the use of the Hofstede dimension scores in management research and training.<ref>Brewer, P. & Venaik, S. 2014. The ecological fallacy in national culture research. Organization Studies, 35(7), 1063-1086.</ref> The same authors compare the Hofstede culture dimension scores with equivalent dimension scores from the GLOBE culture model <ref>House, R.

National culture dimensions: the perpetuation of cultural ignorance. Management Learning, 47(5), 563-589</ref>\n\nIn a re-analysis of the cross-national value data, based on Hofstede, [[Shalom Schwartz]] and [[Ronald Inglehart]] and his own [[factor analysis]] of recent [[World Values Survey]] data, [[Arno Tausch]] [[Corvinus University Budapest]] found however a large-scale confirmation of Hofstede's value scales with other value survey research results. Especially the dimensions Power Distance, Individualism vs. Collectivism, Long-Term Orientation and Indulgence versus Restraint are closely correlated with value dimensions reported by Inglehart, Schwartz and the current data from the [[World Values Survey]].<ref>Tausch, Arno, Hofstede, Inglehart and Beyond.

World Wide Web's citation indexes between 1981 and 2011 listed more than 9,000 articles in peer-reviewed journals citing one or more of Geert's publications. This makes him the currently most cited European social scientist.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nHe received much recognition for his work in cross-cultural analysis. In 2004, the [[Hanze University Groningen]], [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]] established the Geert Hofstede Lecture, a bi-annual conference in the area of intercultural communication.
