The music was scored by [[G. V. Prakash Kumar]]. The film opened to mixed reviews, though performing averagely at the box office, and had a successful 100-day run. The film was later also screened at the [[2012 Cannes Film Festival]] in a non-award ceremony, winning acclaim.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpost.com/bollywood/kollywood-discovers-cannes-meets-up-with-bollywood-315193.html |title=Kollywood discovers Cannes, meets up with Bollywood |publisher=Firstpost |date=20 May 2012 |accessdate=24 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens with Ram ([[Atharvaa]]) fronting a car driven by two guys apparently drunk and rich and with their girl friend(s). He tries to kill them and eventually they escape in the car opening the title. Then it turns to be that Ram enjoys a successful career in information technology. He is hit on by Radhi ([[Sindhu Lokanath|Yashika]]) as office romance. He turns down her interest and reveals he is in love with a girl who resides in [[Bangalore]] and he is going to visit her. Ram drives to Bangalore and meets Charu ([[Amala Paul]]) in her apartment. While sleeping, Ram wakes up goes to the streets, search and kills a person (one of them in the car in first scene). Eventually it is revealed that Charu is in danger and Ram is safeguarding her by not letting her out of that apartment until he cleans up the city for her safety.\n\nRam's CEO Latha comes to India from the US and is also engaged to a guy named Vicky. Latha begins to ask her PA Chandru ([[Santhanam (actor)|Santhanam]]) to find out more about Ram. Latha then asks Chandru to convince Ram to give her lift home, which then Ram agrees to. As Ram and Latha are driving home, they are followed by a red lorry, which attempts to kill both Ram and Latha. Ram manages to push Latha off the car as well as saving himself. Ram is seriously hurt and is taken to the hospital by Latha. Latha then speaks to the doctor, her uncle ([[Jayaprakash]]). Latha explains the doctor that she knows Ram personally and doesn't understand why Ram doesn't recognize her. Ram being unconscious, begins to mutter Charu's name. While Ram and Latha's uncle are having a brief conversation, Latha listens in. It is revealed that Ram and Charu used to work together for a competition and Ram fell in love with Charu from the moment that he met her. It came to a situation where Charu goes to a club to meet a work friend after having found out that her laptop data had been corrupted and she is unable to reach her work. She goes to the club to get a USB backup of her laptop data, before having been teased by drunk guys. These two guys happen to be the two guys Ram tries to kill at the beginning of the film.\n\nCharu goes to the police station to report the two guys who teased her, however, the guys did not take this well and threaten Charu. Ram witnesses this and assumes that there is a problem, however, Charu ensures Ram that he has nothing to worry about and that everything has been sorted.\n\nOn the day of the competition, Ram and Charu go through their presentation, to make sure that they have got everything that they need. Ram looks behind him and notices that he has forgotten something. He explains to Charu that he needs to go back, but will be back in time for the competition. Charu being hesitant at first eventually agrees. Ram went back to get the gift that he has bought Charu, so that he can give to her when he proposes his love for her, after the competition.\n\nRam then manages to go the competition venue on time, however, sees the two guys who teased Charu inside the venue. Ram jumps to the conclusion that the guys have come after Charu and are here to kill her. Ram tries to find them however fails. Ram then reaches the balcony where he witnesses Charu being taken into a car by two guys, which he assumes are the two teasers. Ram then runs after the car but then loses the car and is pushed on the side of the road, where he becomes delusional. He then goes home, and waits for Charu without changing his clothes or having a shower. He sits in one position for two days.  Charu then comes home safe and sound, and is revealed to the doctor that him and Charu have been together ever since.\n\nThe doctor comes out of the room to see a shocked Latha. Latha then reveals to her uncle (the doctor) that her family know her as Latha, but she introduced herself to Ram as Charu, as her name was indeed Charulatha. Latha then reveals what actually happen; Ram went to get the present, while she was left to handle the presentation herself, and ends up winning the whole competition, Her father was a main judge on the competition and was also revealed that this competition was built to see how Charu can handle a whole business and would take over from her father. It was then revealed that Ram would not get a position in this company at all, and with Charu feeling guilty, she calls after Ram, which Ram hears and sees. She was taken into the car by her father which made it look like she was being kidnapped to Ram.\n\nThe doctor then persuades Latha to act like the Charu that she was while living with him. At first she disagrees, however, after Ram gains his consciousness, Ram receives a call from a so-called 'Charu'. Latha goes back to Bangalore, where she visits the woman who is acting as Charu to Ram over the phone.  It is revealed that a blind woman acts as Charu, only because Ram keeps calling her and asking about her and refuses to believe that this isn't Charu's number. Latha then breaks into her old Bangalore home, and spies on Ram, with her uncle assisting her. Ram comes home and hugs a so-called Charu. We then realise that it isn't actually Charu he is hugging, but he is hugging nothing but an empty space.\n\nLatha then asks her uncle what had happened to Ram. Ram is suffering from severe delusions and is imagining that Charu is still present with him, hence the reason why Ram didn't recognise her in the first place. The only way these delusions would go, is if Latha acts as if she was Charu, back in Bangalore.\n\nLatha then acts as Charu and begins falling in love with Ram. Ram then explains to her that they are going to get married soon. They then reach a temple, where Charu and Ram are meant to marry. Latha had planned with her uncle and Chandru a fake killing so that Ram's delusions can leave him, which fails. Latha is then genuinely kidnapped by two guys, who are her so known fianc\u00e9's friends. It is revealed that her fianc\u00e9 Vicky, is in fact gay and his friends can not accept Vicky marrying any girl who gets in his way which includes Latha. The two guys attempt on killing Latha but is defeated by Ram. Ram then attempts to save Latha by taking her to the hospital but is then hit on the head. Ram gains his consciousness and goes home and waits for Charu at home, sitting in a position for two days, waiting for Charu. The delusion he sees is Charu coming back to him, in tears and saying that she is alright. Ram bursts into tears and goes to have a shower so that he can relax and start over with Charu. Latha however is still in hospital with her father and uncle by her side. Her uncle reveals that it was him who hit Ram on the head, so that he can take Latha to the hospital to get her checked out, yet he explains to Charu that she better  of with Ram as he will keep her happy. Latha's father agrees and Latha insists that she goes to Ram.\n\nLatha then goes home to Ram, who still believes that Charu has come home long before. The film ends with Latha raising her arms asking for a hug from Ram, which Ram smiles and gives her.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Atharvaa]] as Ramachandran\n* [[Amala Paul]] as Charulatha alias Charu and Latha\n* [[Anupama Kumar]] as Meenakshi\n* [[Jayaprakash]] as Dr. Rudhran\n* [[Santhanam (actor)|Santhanam]] as Chandru\n* [[Sindhu Lokanath|Yashika]] as Radhi\n* [[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]] as Priest\n* [[Jagan]] \n* Ravi Prakash\n* [[Ashvin Raja]]\n* Niranjan Jayaprakash\n\n==Production==\n\n[[Simran (actress)|Simran]] was initially approached to play the role of Adharvaa's mother in the film, however she refused citing that she was unwilling to act as a mother at this stage in her career.

The music was scored by [[G. V. Prakash Kumar]]. The film opened to mixed reviews, though performing averagely at the box office, and had a successful 100-day run. The film was later also screened at the [[2012 Cannes Film Festival]] in a non-award ceremony, winning acclaim.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpost.com/bollywood/kollywood-discovers-cannes-meets-up-with-bollywood-315193.html |title=Kollywood discovers Cannes, meets up with Bollywood |publisher=Firstpost |date=20 May 2012 |accessdate=24 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens with Ram ([[Atharvaa]]) fronting a car driven by two guys apparently drunk and rich and with their girl friend(s). He tries to kill them and eventually they escape in the car opening the title. Then it turns to be that Ram enjoys a successful career in information technology. He is hit on by Radhi ([[Sindhu Lokanath|Yashika]]) as office romance. He turns down her interest and reveals he is in love with a girl who resides in [[Bangalore]] and he is going to visit her. Ram drives to Bangalore and meets Charu ([[Amala Paul]]) in her apartment. While sleeping, Ram wakes up goes to the streets, search and kills a person (one of them in the car in first scene). Eventually it is revealed that Charu is in danger and Ram is safeguarding her by not letting her out of that apartment until he cleans up the city for her safety.\n\nRam's CEO Latha comes to India from the US and is also engaged to a guy named Vicky. Latha begins to ask her PA Chandru ([[Santhanam (actor)|Santhanam]]) to find out more about Ram. Latha then asks Chandru to convince Ram to give her lift home, which then Ram agrees to. As Ram and Latha are driving home, they are followed by a red lorry, which attempts to kill both Ram and Latha. Ram manages to push Latha off the car as well as saving himself. Ram is seriously hurt and is taken to the hospital by Latha. Latha then speaks to the doctor, her uncle ([[Jayaprakash]]). Latha explains the doctor that she knows Ram personally and doesn't understand why Ram doesn't recognize her. Ram being unconscious, begins to mutter Charu's name. While Ram and Latha's uncle are having a brief conversation, Latha listens in. It is revealed that Ram and Charu used to work together for a competition and Ram fell in love with Charu from the moment that he met her. It came to a situation where Charu goes to a club to meet a work friend after having found out that her laptop data had been corrupted and she is unable to reach her work. She goes to the club to get a USB backup of her laptop data, before having been teased by drunk guys. These two guys happen to be the two guys Ram tries to kill at the beginning of the film.\n\nCharu goes to the police station to report the two guys who teased her, however, the guys did not take this well and threaten Charu. Ram witnesses this and assumes that there is a problem, however, Charu ensures Ram that he has nothing to worry about and that everything has been sorted.\n\nOn the day of the competition, Ram and Charu go through their presentation, to make sure that they have got everything that they need. Ram looks behind him and notices that he has forgotten something. He explains to Charu that he needs to go back, but will be back in time for the competition. Charu being hesitant at first eventually agrees. Ram went back to get the gift that he has bought Charu, so that he can give to her when he proposes his love for her, after the competition.\n\nRam then manages to go the competition venue on time, however, sees the two guys who teased Charu inside the venue. Ram jumps to the conclusion that the guys have come after Charu and are here to kill her. Ram tries to find them however fails. Ram then reaches the balcony where he witnesses Charu being taken into a car by two guys, which he assumes are the two teasers. Ram then runs after the car but then loses the car and is pushed on the side of the road, where he becomes delusional. He then goes home, and waits for Charu without changing his clothes or having a shower. He sits in one position for two days.  Charu then comes home safe and sound, and is revealed to the doctor that him and Charu have been together ever since.\n\nThe doctor comes out of the room to see a shocked Latha. Latha then reveals to her uncle (the doctor) that her family know her as Latha, but she introduced herself to Ram as Charu, as her name was indeed Charulatha. Latha then reveals what actually happen; Ram went to get the present, while she was left to handle the presentation herself, and ends up winning the whole competition, Her father was a main judge on the competition and was also revealed that this competition was built to see how Charu can handle a whole business and would take over from her father. It was then revealed that Ram would not get a position in this company at all, and with Charu feeling guilty, she calls after Ram, which Ram hears and sees. She was taken into the car by her father which made it look like she was being kidnapped to Ram.\n\nThe doctor then persuades Latha to act like the Charu that she was while living with him. At first she disagrees, however, after Ram gains his consciousness, Ram receives a call from a so-called 'Charu'. Latha goes back to Bangalore, where she visits the woman who is acting as Charu to Ram over the phone.  It is revealed that a blind woman acts as Charu, only because Ram keeps calling her and asking about her and refuses to believe that this isn't Charu's number. Latha then breaks into her old Bangalore home, and spies on Ram, with her uncle assisting her. Ram comes home and hugs a so-called Charu. We then realise that it isn't actually Charu he is hugging, but he is hugging nothing but an empty space.\n\nLatha then asks her uncle what had happened to Ram. Ram is suffering from severe delusions and is imagining that Charu is still present with him, hence the reason why Ram didn't recognise her in the first place. The only way these delusions would go, is if Latha acts as if she was Charu, back in Bangalore.\n\nLatha then acts as Charu and begins falling in love with Ram. Ram then explains to her that they are going to get married soon. They then reach a temple, where Charu and Ram are meant to marry. Latha had planned with her uncle and Chandru a fake killing so that Ram's delusions can leave him, which fails. Latha is then genuinely kidnapped by two guys, who are her so known fianc\u00e9's friends. It is revealed that her fianc\u00e9 Vicky, is in fact gay and his friends can not accept Vicky marrying any girl who gets in his way which includes Latha. The two guys attempt on killing Latha but is defeated by Ram. Ram then attempts to save Latha by taking her to the hospital but is then hit on the head. Ram gains his consciousness and goes home and waits for Charu at home, sitting in a position for two days, waiting for Charu. The delusion he sees is Charu coming back to him, in tears and saying that she is alright. Ram bursts into tears and goes to have a shower so that he can relax and start over with Charu. Latha however is still in hospital with her father and uncle by her side. Her uncle reveals that it was him who hit Ram on the head, so that he can take Latha to the hospital to get her checked out, yet he explains to Charu that she better  of with Ram as he will keep her happy. Latha's father agrees and Latha insists that she goes to Ram.\n\nLatha then goes home to Ram, who still believes that Charu has come home long before. The film ends with Latha raising her arms asking for a hug from Ram, which Ram smiles and gives her.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Atharvaa]] as Ramachandran\n* [[Amala Paul]] as Charulatha alias Charu and Latha\n* [[Anupama Kumar]] as Meenakshi\n* [[Jayaprakash]] as Dr. Rudhran\n* [[Santhanam (actor)|Santhanam]] as Chandru\n* [[Sindhu Lokanath|Yashika]] as Radhi\n* [[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]] as Priest\n* [[Jagan]] \n* Ravi Prakash\n* [[Ashvin Raja]]\n* Niranjan Jayaprakash\n\n==Production==\n\n[[Simran (actress)|Simran]] was initially approached to play the role of Adharvaa's mother in the film, however she refused citing that she was unwilling to act as a mother at this stage in her career.

The club's chairman was [[Karl Ibach (footballer)|Karl Ibach]] until 25 September 1913. From that date [[Carl Albert Hintermann]] took over until the AGM.

The other teams playing in the Central group were [[BSC Young Boys|Young Boys]], [[FC La Chaux-de-Fonds]], [[FC \u00c9toile-Sporting|\u00c9toile-Sporting FC La Chaux-de-Fonds]], [[FC Bern]] and [[FC Biel-Bienne|Biel-Bienne]]. Basel started well into the championship winning seven of the first eight games, the first four games straight off.

The club's chairman was [[Karl Ibach (footballer)|Karl Ibach]] until 25 September 1913. From that date [[Carl Albert Hintermann]] took over until the AGM. FC Basel played their home games in the [[Landhof]] in the district Basel-Wettstein in Kleinbasel, [[Basel]].\n\n== Overview ==\nIn the 1913\u201314 season Basel played 32 matches. 14 of these were in the domestic league and 18 were friendly matches. Of these friendlies 10 were won and 8 ended with a defeat. Six of these games were played in the [[Landhof]], one other home game on the Margarethenwiese in [[Basel]], five others were away games in Switzerland and five games were played abroad. In these 18 games Basel scored a total of 57 goals and conceded 47.\n\nThe [[1913\u201314 Swiss Serie A|Swiss Serie A 1913\u201314]] was divided into three regional groups, East, Central and West. Basel were allocated to the Central group together with local rivals [[BSC Old Boys|Old Boys]] and [[FC Nordstern Basel|Nordstern Basel]]. The other teams playing in the Central group were [[BSC Young Boys|Young Boys]], [[FC La Chaux-de-Fonds]], [[FC \u00c9toile-Sporting|\u00c9toile-Sporting FC La Chaux-de-Fonds]], [[FC Bern]] and [[FC Biel-Bienne|Biel-Bienne]]. Basel started well into the championship winning seven of the first eight games, the first four games straight off. After the new year break things turned against them and they were defeated three times. Basel lost contact to the Young Boys at the top of the table and ended the season in joint second position with FC Bern, they were three points behind the group winners. In there 14 games Basel scored 63 goals and conceded 33. The Young Boys continued to the finals against [[Cantonal Neuchatel]] and [[FC Aarau|Aarau]], who eventually won the championship in the Finals.\n\nThe Anglo-Cup was not played in this year and in fact was discontinued.<ref name=\"rsssf 1914\">{{cite web | first = Erik | last = Garin | authorlink = | year = | url = http://www.rsssf.com/tablesz/zwithist-reg.html#1913 | title = Switzerland 1913-1914 | format = | work = | publisher = rsssf.com | accessdate = 2018-11-16}}</ref> So Basel could not defend the titel that they had obtained the year before.\n\n== Players ==\n;Squad members\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat=SUI |pos=GK |name= [[Fridolin Wenger]] }}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat=SUI |pos=DF |name= [[Paul Bettex]] }}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat=SUI |pos=DF |name= [[Hermann Moll (footballer)|Hermann Moll]] }}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat=SUI |pos=DF |name= [[Peter Riesterer]] }}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat=SUI |pos=MF |name= [[Fritz Albicker]] (II) }} \n{{Fs player|no= |nat=SUI |pos=MF |name= [[Wilhelm 'Willy' Geisser]] }} \n{{Fs player|no= |nat=GER |pos=MF |name= [[Josef Goldschmidt]] }} \n{{Fs player|no= |nat=SUI |pos=MF |name= [[Ernst Gossweiler]] }}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat=SUI |pos=MF |name= [[Emil Hasler (footballer)|Emil Hasler]] }}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat=SUI |pos=MF |name= [[Ernst Kaltenbach]] }}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat=SUI |pos=MF |name= [[Otto Kuhn]] }}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat=SUI |pos=MF |name= [[Emil Schreyer]] }}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat=SUI |pos=FW |name= [[Fritz Aeppli]] }}\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat=SUI |pos=FW |name= [[Christian Albicker]] (I) }}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat= |pos=FW |name= [[Rudolf Bredschneider]] }}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat=ENG |pos=FW |name= [[Percy Humphreys]] }}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat= |pos=FW |name= [[Carl Schloz]] }}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat=SUI |pos=FW |name= [[Karl Wunderle]] }}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat= |pos= |name= [[Roger Breithaupt]] }}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat= |pos= |name= [[Walter Fl\u00fcck]] }}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat= |pos= |name= [[Max Glenck]] }}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat= |pos=GK |name= [[Emil Fehr]] }}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat= |pos=GK |name= [[Camillo Persenico]] }}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat= |pos=GK |name= Schaltenbrand }}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat= |pos= |name= ?

A spin-off of the video game ''[[Minecraft]]'', it was first announced in May 2019, and is available on [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[iOS]], and [[iPadOS]]. The game is [[free-to-play]], and was first released in [[early access]] in October 2019.Minecraft is a very good game which you can play. How ever minecraft is not free but minecraft earth is.\n\n==Gameplay==\nSimilar to ''Minecraft'', ''Minecraft Earth'' is centered around building structures, gathering resources, crafting, and exploration. The game utilizes the same [[Bedrock game engine]] as other versions of ''Minecraft''. In \"build mode\", players can build augmented reality structures on \"Buildplates\" in collaboration with other players, then explore them in full size with \"play mode\".

Over 10,000 people have been killed in Hindu-Muslim communal violence since 1950 in 6,933 instances of communal violence between 1954 and 1982.<ref name=\"Na\u02bb\u012bm2008\">{{cite book|author=\u02bbAbd All\u0101h A\u1e25mad Na\u02bb\u012bm|title=Islam and the Secular State: Negotiating the Future of Shari'a|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yk_CP3QiUl4C&pg=PA161|year=2008|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02776-3|pages=161}}</ref>\n\nThe causes of this [[violence against Muslims]] are varied. The roots are thought to lie in India's history&nbsp;\u2013 resentment toward the [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Islamic conquest]] of India during the [[Middle Ages]], policies established by the country's [[British Raj|British colonizers]], and the violent partition of India into an [[Islamic state]] of [[Pakistan]] and India with a Muslim minority.\nMany scholars believe that incidents of anti-Muslim violence are politically motivated and a part of the electoral strategy of mainstream political parties who are associated with [[Hindu nationalism]] like the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (political wing of  [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh|RSS]]). Other scholars believe that the violence is not widespread but that it is restricted to certain urban areas because of local socio-political conditions.<ref name=\"Atal2009\">{{cite book|author=Yogesh Atal|title=Sociology and Social Anthropology in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Z2E1q1JLVsC&pg=PA241|year=2009|publisher=Pearson Education India|isbn=978-81-317-2034-9|pages=250\u2013251}}</ref>\n\n==Manifestation==\nViolence against Muslims is frequently in the form of mob attacks on [[Muslim]]s by [[Hindu]]s.{{sfn|Brass|2003|p=65|quote=Deaths in Hindu-Muslim riots have three sources: \"Mob action\", \"police killings\" and \"isolated incidents\". \"Mob action\" may take the form of confrontations between gangs or crowds from different communities or segments of them, armed with sticks, knives, swords, and occasionally bombs and small weapons, and kerosene. It often involves armed gangs from one community seeking out defenseless persons or whole families in their homes, slashing and cutting up the male members and sometimes the female members, and raping the latter, and burning all alive including the children. A second source is police killings, which account for a large number of deaths in several major riots for which figures have been provided by inquiry commission reports, and which cannot be justified in terms of \"crowd control\". These killings are disproportionately of Muslims.}}{{sfn|Riaz|2008|p=165|ps=: \"Violence perpetrated against Muslims is now naturalized: riots are 'well-known and accepted transgression of routine political behavior in India.' ... 'Hindu-Muslim riots and anti-Muslim pogroms have been endemic in India since independence.'\"}} These attacks are referred to as [[Communal violence|communal riots]] in India and are seen to be part of a pattern of sporadic [[sectarian violence]] between the majority Hindu and minority Muslim communities, and have also been connected to a rise in [[Islamophobia]] throughout the 20th century.{{sfn|Herman|2006|p=65}} Most incidents have occurred in the northern and western states of India, whereas communalist sentiment in the south is less pronounced.{{sfn|Cohen|2013|p=66}} Among the largest incidents were [[Great Calcutta killings]] in 1946, [[Noakhali riots#Repercussions in Bihar|Bihar]] and Garmukhteshwar in 1946 after [[Noakhali riot]] in East Bengal, the massacre of Muslims in [[Jammu Division|Jammu]] in 1947, large-scale killing of Muslims following the [[Operation Polo]] in [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]], anti-Muslim riots in Kolkata in the aftermath of [[1950 Barisal Riots]] and [[1964 East-Pakistan riots]], [[1969 Gujarat riots]], [[1984 Bhiwandi riot]], [[1985 Gujarat riots]], [[1989 Bhagalpur riots]], [[Bombay riots]],  [[Nellie massacre|Nellie]] in 1983{{sfn|Ganguly|2007|p=135}} and [[2002 Gujarat violence|Gujarat riot]] in 2002 and [[2013 Muzaffarnagar riots]].\n\nThese patterns of violence have been well-established since partition, with dozens of studies documenting instances of mass violence against minority groups.{{sfn|Pennington|2012|p=32}} Over 10,000 people have been killed in Hindu-Muslim communal violence since 1950.{{sfn|Dhattiwala|2012|pp=483\u2013516}} According to official figures, there were 6,933 instances of communal violence between 1954 and 1982 and, between 1968 and 1980, there were 530 Hindus and 1,598 Muslims killed in a total of 3,949 instances of mass violence.{{sfn|Brass|2003|p=60}}\n\nIn 1989, there were incidents of mass violence throughout the north of India.{{sfn|Chandavarkar|2009|p=29}}  [[Praveen Swami]] believes these periodic acts of violence have \"scarred India's post independence history\" and have also hindered India's cause in [[Jammu and Kashmir]] with regard to the [[Kashmir conflict]].{{sfn|Swami|2006|p=217}}\n\nIn 2017, IndiaSpend reported that 84% of the victims of [[cow vigilante violence in India since 2014|cow vigilante violence in India]] from 2010 to 2017 were Muslims, and almost 97% of these attacks were reported after May 2014.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rao|first1=Ojaswi|last2=Abraham|first2=Delna|title=86% Dead In Cow-Related Violence Since 2010 Are Muslim; 97% Attacks After 2014|url=http://www.indiaspend.com/cover-story/86-dead-in-cow-related-violence-since-2010-are-muslim-97-attacks-after-2014-2014|website=IndiaSpend.com|accessdate=23 September 2017|date=28 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Wilkes \n|first1=Tommy|last2=Srivastava|first2=Roli|title=Protests held across India after attacks against Muslims|url=https://in.reuters.com/article/india-protests/protests-held-across-india-after-attacks-against-muslims-idINKBN19J2C3|website=Reuters|accessdate=11 March 2020|date=28 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Causes and effects==\n{{location map+|India|float=right|width=400|caption=Location of incidents.

In particular, scholars fault the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) and the [[Shiv Sena]] for complicity in these incidents of violence{{sfn|Brass|b}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2011|p=376}}{{sfn|Sarkur|2007|p=187}}{{sfn|Brekke|2012|pp=86\u201387}} and of using violence against Muslims as a part of a larger electoral strategy.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2011|p=376}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2011|p=382}} For example, research by Raheel Dhattiwala and Michael Biggs has stated that killings are far higher in areas where the BJP faces stiff electoral opposition than in areas in which it is already strong.{{sfn|Dhattiwala|2012|pp=483\u2013516}} In 1989, the north of India saw an increase in orchestrated attacks on Muslims, and the BJP had further success in the local and state elections.{{sfn|Chandavarkar|2009|p=114}} The [[social anthropologist]] [[Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah]] concludes that the violence in [[Bhagalpur]] in [[1989 Bhagalpur violence|1989]], Hashimpura in [[Hashimpura massacre|1987]] and in [[Moradabad]] [[1980 Moradabad riots|1980]] were organised killings.{{sfn|Tambiah|1997|p=321}} According to [[Ram Puniyani]], the Shiv Sena  were victorious in the elections due to the violence in the 1990s, and the BJP in Gujarat after the 2002 violence.{{sfn|Puniyan|2003|pp=12\u201313}} [[Gyan Prakash]], however, cautions that the BJP's actions in Gujarat do not equate to the entirety of India, and it remains to be seen if the [[Hindutva]] movement has been successful in the deployment of this strategy nationwide.{{sfn|Prakash|2007|pp=177\u2013179}}\n\n===Economic and cultural factors===\nHindu nationalists use the historical [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|subjugation]] of India by Muslims as an excuse for violence. They feel that, since the Partition, Indian Muslims are [[Pro-Pakistan sentiment|allied to Pakistan]] and are possibly radicalised  and, therefore, the Hindus must take defensive steps to avoid repeat of the past wrongs and reassert their pride.{{Original research inline|date=August 2015}}{{sfn|Etzion|2008|pp=123\u2013124}} The higher fertility rate among Muslims has been a recurring theme in the Hindu Right's rhetoric. They claim that the [[Islam in India#Population growth rate|higher]] birth rate among Muslims is part of a plan to turn the Hindus into a minority within their own country.{{Original research inline|date=August 2015}}{{sfn|Weigl|2012|p=19}}\n\nAnother reason given for these outbreaks of violence is the upward mobility of the [[Caste system in India|lower castes]] caused by the expansion of the economy. The violence has become a substitute for class tensions.  Nationalists, rather than deal with the claims from the lower class, instead view Muslims and Christians as not \"fully Indian\" due to their religion,{{sfn|Metcalf|2006|p=89}} and portray those who carry out these attacks as \"heroes\" that defended the majority from \"anti-nationals\".{{sfn|Puniyan|2003|pp=12\u201313}} Muslims are viewed as suspect and their loyalty to the state is questioned because of the ill-will still prevalent after the violence during [[Partition of India|partition]]. According to [[Omar Khalidi]]:\n\n<blockquote>Anti-Muslim violence is planned and executed to render Muslims economically and socially crippled and, as a final outcome of that economic and social backwardness, assimilating them into lower rungs of Hindu society.{{sfn|Puniyan|2003|p=153}}</blockquote>\n\n[[Cultural nationalism]] has also been given as a reason for instances of violence carried out by [[Shiv Sena]] which initially claimed to speak for the people of [[Maharashtra]], but quickly turned their [[rhetoric]] to inciting violence against Muslims. The Shiv Sena were complicit in the violence in 1984 in the town of [[Bhiwandi]], and again in the violence in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] in 1992 and 1993.{{sfn|Chandavarkar|2009|p=29}} Violence has been incited by Sena in 1971 and 1986.{{sfn|Kaur|2005|p=160}}{{sfn|Chandavarkar|2009|p=114}}  According to [[Sudipta Kaviraj]], the [[Vishva Hindu Parishad]] (VHP) are still engaged in the religious conflicts which began in the medieval times.{{sfn|Kaviraj|2010|p=245}}\n\nAnti-Muslim violence creates a security risk for Hindus residing outside of India. Since the 1950s, there have been retaliatory attacks on Hindus in Pakistan and [[Bangladesh]] in response to anti-Muslim violence in India. After the 1992 violence in Bombay, Hindu temples were attacked in [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Dubai]] and [[Thailand]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|2006|p=16}} This recurring violence has become a rigidly conventional pattern which has created a divide between the Muslim and Hindu communities.{{sfn|Shani|2007|p=187}}\n\n[[Jamaat-e-Islami Hind]] has spoken out against these communal clashes, as it believes that the violence not only impacts upon Muslims, but India as a whole, and that these riots are damaging to India's progress.{{sfn|Sikand|2004|p=86}} In Gujarat, the [[Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act]] (TADA) was used in incidents pertaining to communal violence in 1992 and 1993.  The majority of those arrested under the act were Muslim.  Conversely, TADA was not used after the violence carried out against Muslims during the [[Bombay riots]].{{sfn|Singh|2012|p=427}}\n\n===Demographics===\nThe BJP politicians, as well as those of other parties, argue that [[demographics]] play an essential role in Indian elections. The BJP believe that the higher the number of Muslims within a constituency, the higher are the chances of centrist parties  to acquiesce to minority groups' requests, which lowers the chances of Muslims \"building bridges\" with their Hindu neighbours.  As such, according to this argument \"Muslim appeasement\" is the root cause of communal violence.{{sfn|Varshney|2003|p=8}} Susanne and Lloyd Rudolph argue that the economic disparity is a reason for the aggression shown towards Muslims by Hindus. As India's economy expanded due to [[globalization]] and [[investment]] from overseas companies, the expectations of the Hindu population were not matched by the opportunities. Hindu nationalists then encouraged the perception of Muslims as the source of the Hindus' troubles.{{sfn|Price|2012|p=95}}\n\nThe actions of anti-Hindu and [[Insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir|anti-India militant groups]] in [[Kashmir conflict|Kashmir]] and Pakistan have reinforced anti-Muslim feelings in India, which has strengthened the Hindu Right. The [[Hindutva]] discourse portrays Muslims as traitors and state enemies, whose patriotism is suspected.{{sfn|Sikand|2006|p=88}} [[Sumit Ganguly]] argues that the rise in terrorism cannot only be attributed to [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] factors, but also to the violence perpetrated by Hindutva forces.{{sfn|Ganguly|2003|p=10}}\n\n==Major incidents==\n\n===1964 Kolkata===\nRiots between [[Hindu]]s and [[Muslim]]s had left over a hundred people dead, 438 people were injured. Over 7000 people were arrested. 70,000 Muslims have fled their homes and 55,000 were provided protection by the [[Indian army]]. Muslims in Kolkata became more ghettoized than ever before in the aftermath of this riot. The riot was believed to be instigated by violence against Hindus in [[East Pakistan]] (now Bangladesh) and the flow of refugees from there. Violence was also seen in rural [[West Bengal]].<ref>{{cite web|title=1964: Riots in Calcutta leave more than 100 dead|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/13/newsid_4098000/4098363.stm|website=news.bbc.co.uk|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=7 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n===1983 Nellie massacre===\nIn the state of [[Assam]] in 1983 the [[Nellie massacre]] occurred. Nearly 1,800 Muslims of Bengali origin were slaughtered by [[Lalung]] tribespeople (also known as Tiwa) at a village called Nellie.{{sfn|Hazarika|1984}}{{sfn|Kokrajhar|Dhubri|2012}} It has been described as one of the most severe massacres since [[World War II]] with the majority of victims being women and children, as a result of the actions of the [[Assam Movement]].{{sfn|Ghosh|2004|p=312}}{{sfn|Hussain|2009|p=261}}\n\nOne reason cited for this incident is that it resulted from a build-up of resentment over immigration.{{sfn|Datta|2012|p=183}} The Assam movement insisted on striking the names of [[Illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]] from the electoral register and their deportation from the state. There was widespread support for the movement, which tapered off between 1981 and 1982.{{sfn|Chatterji|2013|p=481}}\n\nThe movement demanded that anyone who had entered the state illegally since 1951 be deported.  The central government, however, insisted on a cutoff date of 1971. Towards the end of 1982, the central government called elections and the movement called for people to [[boycott]] it, which led to the widespread violence.{{sfn|Chatterji|2013|p=418}}\n\nThe official Tiwari Commission report on the Nellie massacre is still a closely guarded secret (only three copies exist).<ref name=\"AT\">{{cite web |url=http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/details.asp?id=feb1908/at02|title=83 polls were a mistake: KPS Gill|publisher=Assam Tribune|date= 18 February 2008|accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref> The 600-page report was submitted to the Assam Government in 1984 and the Congress Government (headed by [[Hiteswar Saikia]]) decided not to make it public, and subsequent Governments followed suit.<ref name=\"Tehelka\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tehelka.com/story_main19.asp?filename=Ne093006the_horrors.asp|title=An Untold Shame|last=Rehman|first=Teresa|publisher=Tehelka Magazine|accessdate=2011-12-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111192753/http://www.tehelka.com/story_main19.asp?filename=Ne093006the_horrors.asp|archive-date=11 November 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Assam United Democratic Front]] and others are making legal efforts to make Tiwari Commission report public, so that reasonable justice is delivered to victims, at least after 25 years after the incident.<ref>{{cite news | last =Reporter | first =Staff | title =Flashback to Nellie Horror:AUDF to move court for probe report | newspaper =The Telegraph | date =19 February 2008 | url =http://www.telegraphindia.com/1080219/jsp/guwahati/story_8920369.jsp |accessdate=10 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nSince, then there have been no instances of communal violence in [[Upper Assam Division|Upper Assam]].{{sfn|Saikia|2005|p=65}}\n\n===1969 to 1989===\nDuring the [[1969 Gujarat riots]], it is estimated that 630 people lost their lives.{{sfn|Khalidi|2009|p=180}} The [[1970 Bhiwandi Riots]] was an instance of anti-Muslim violence which occurred between 7 and 8 May in the Indian towns of Bhiwandi, Jalgaon and Mahad.

The official estimate is 400 and other observers estimate between 1,500 and 2,000.

It often involves armed gangs from one community seeking out defenseless persons or whole families in their homes, slashing and cutting up the male members and sometimes the female members, and raping the latter, and burning all alive including the children. A second source is police killings, which account for a large number of deaths in several major riots for which figures have been provided by inquiry commission reports, and which cannot be justified in terms of \"crowd control\". These killings are disproportionately of Muslims.}}{{sfn|Riaz|2008|p=165|ps=: \"Violence perpetrated against Muslims is now naturalized: riots are 'well-known and accepted transgression of routine political behavior in India.' ...

In particular, scholars fault the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) and the [[Shiv Sena]] for complicity in these incidents of violence{{sfn|Brass|b}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2011|p=376}}{{sfn|Sarkur|2007|p=187}}{{sfn|Brekke|2012|pp=86\u201387}} and of using violence against Muslims as a part of a larger electoral strategy.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2011|p=376}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2011|p=382}} For example, research by Raheel Dhattiwala and Michael Biggs has stated that killings are far higher in areas where the BJP faces stiff electoral opposition than in areas in which it is already strong.{{sfn|Dhattiwala|2012|pp=483\u2013516}} In 1989, the north of India saw an increase in orchestrated attacks on Muslims, and the BJP had further success in the local and state elections.{{sfn|Chandavarkar|2009|p=114}} The [[social anthropologist]] [[Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah]] concludes that the violence in [[Bhagalpur]] in [[1989 Bhagalpur violence|1989]], Hashimpura in [[Hashimpura massacre|1987]] and in [[Moradabad]] [[1980 Moradabad riots|1980]] were organised killings.{{sfn|Tambiah|1997|p=321}} According to [[Ram Puniyani]], the Shiv Sena  were victorious in the elections due to the violence in the 1990s, and the BJP in Gujarat after the 2002 violence.{{sfn|Puniyan|2003|pp=12\u201313}} [[Gyan Prakash]], however, cautions that the BJP's actions in Gujarat do not equate to the entirety of India, and it remains to be seen if the [[Hindutva]] movement has been successful in the deployment of this strategy nationwide.{{sfn|Prakash|2007|pp=177\u2013179}}\n\n===Economic and cultural factors===\nHindu nationalists use the historical [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|subjugation]] of India by Muslims as an excuse for violence. They feel that, since the Partition, Indian Muslims are [[Pro-Pakistan sentiment|allied to Pakistan]] and are possibly radicalised  and, therefore, the Hindus must take defensive steps to avoid repeat of the past wrongs and reassert their pride.{{Original research inline|date=August 2015}}{{sfn|Etzion|2008|pp=123\u2013124}} The higher fertility rate among Muslims has been a recurring theme in the Hindu Right's rhetoric. They claim that the [[Islam in India#Population growth rate|higher]] birth rate among Muslims is part of a plan to turn the Hindus into a minority within their own country.{{Original research inline|date=August 2015}}{{sfn|Weigl|2012|p=19}}\n\nAnother reason given for these outbreaks of violence is the upward mobility of the [[Caste system in India|lower castes]] caused by the expansion of the economy. The violence has become a substitute for class tensions.  Nationalists, rather than deal with the claims from the lower class, instead view Muslims and Christians as not \"fully Indian\" due to their religion,{{sfn|Metcalf|2006|p=89}} and portray those who carry out these attacks as \"heroes\" that defended the majority from \"anti-nationals\".{{sfn|Puniyan|2003|pp=12\u201313}} Muslims are viewed as suspect and their loyalty to the state is questioned because of the ill-will still prevalent after the violence during [[Partition of India|partition]]. According to [[Omar Khalidi]]:\n\n<blockquote>Anti-Muslim violence is planned and executed to render Muslims economically and socially crippled and, as a final outcome of that economic and social backwardness, assimilating them into lower rungs of Hindu society.{{sfn|Puniyan|2003|p=153}}</blockquote>\n\n[[Cultural nationalism]] has also been given as a reason for instances of violence carried out by [[Shiv Sena]] which initially claimed to speak for the people of [[Maharashtra]], but quickly turned their [[rhetoric]] to inciting violence against Muslims. The Shiv Sena were complicit in the violence in 1984 in the town of [[Bhiwandi]], and again in the violence in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] in 1992 and 1993.{{sfn|Chandavarkar|2009|p=29}} Violence has been incited by Sena in 1971 and 1986.{{sfn|Kaur|2005|p=160}}{{sfn|Chandavarkar|2009|p=114}}  According to [[Sudipta Kaviraj]], the [[Vishva Hindu Parishad]] (VHP) are still engaged in the religious conflicts which began in the medieval times.{{sfn|Kaviraj|2010|p=245}}\n\nAnti-Muslim violence creates a security risk for Hindus residing outside of India. Since the 1950s, there have been retaliatory attacks on Hindus in Pakistan and [[Bangladesh]] in response to anti-Muslim violence in India. After the 1992 violence in Bombay, Hindu temples were attacked in [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Dubai]] and [[Thailand]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|2006|p=16}} This recurring violence has become a rigidly conventional pattern which has created a divide between the Muslim and Hindu communities.{{sfn|Shani|2007|p=187}}\n\n[[Jamaat-e-Islami Hind]] has spoken out against these communal clashes, as it believes that the violence not only impacts upon Muslims, but India as a whole, and that these riots are damaging to India's progress.{{sfn|Sikand|2004|p=86}} In Gujarat, the [[Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act]] (TADA) was used in incidents pertaining to communal violence in 1992 and 1993.  The majority of those arrested under the act were Muslim.  Conversely, TADA was not used after the violence carried out against Muslims during the [[Bombay riots]].{{sfn|Singh|2012|p=427}}\n\n===Demographics===\nThe BJP politicians, as well as those of other parties, argue that [[demographics]] play an essential role in Indian elections. The BJP believe that the higher the number of Muslims within a constituency, the higher are the chances of centrist parties  to acquiesce to minority groups' requests, which lowers the chances of Muslims \"building bridges\" with their Hindu neighbours.  As such, according to this argument \"Muslim appeasement\" is the root cause of communal violence.{{sfn|Varshney|2003|p=8}} Susanne and Lloyd Rudolph argue that the economic disparity is a reason for the aggression shown towards Muslims by Hindus. As India's economy expanded due to [[globalization]] and [[investment]] from overseas companies, the expectations of the Hindu population were not matched by the opportunities. Hindu nationalists then encouraged the perception of Muslims as the source of the Hindus' troubles.{{sfn|Price|2012|p=95}}\n\nThe actions of anti-Hindu and [[Insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir|anti-India militant groups]] in [[Kashmir conflict|Kashmir]] and Pakistan have reinforced anti-Muslim feelings in India, which has strengthened the Hindu Right. The [[Hindutva]] discourse portrays Muslims as traitors and state enemies, whose patriotism is suspected.{{sfn|Sikand|2006|p=88}} [[Sumit Ganguly]] argues that the rise in terrorism cannot only be attributed to [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] factors, but also to the violence perpetrated by Hindutva forces.{{sfn|Ganguly|2003|p=10}}\n\n==Major incidents==\n\n===1964 Kolkata===\nRiots between [[Hindu]]s and [[Muslim]]s had left over a hundred people dead, 438 people were injured. Over 7000 people were arrested. 70,000 Muslims have fled their homes and 55,000 were provided protection by the [[Indian army]]. Muslims in Kolkata became more ghettoized than ever before in the aftermath of this riot. The riot was believed to be instigated by violence against Hindus in [[East Pakistan]] (now Bangladesh) and the flow of refugees from there. Violence was also seen in rural [[West Bengal]].<ref>{{cite web|title=1964: Riots in Calcutta leave more than 100 dead|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/13/newsid_4098000/4098363.stm|website=news.bbc.co.uk|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=7 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n===1983 Nellie massacre===\nIn the state of [[Assam]] in 1983 the [[Nellie massacre]] occurred. Nearly 1,800 Muslims of Bengali origin were slaughtered by [[Lalung]] tribespeople (also known as Tiwa) at a village called Nellie.{{sfn|Hazarika|1984}}{{sfn|Kokrajhar|Dhubri|2012}} It has been described as one of the most severe massacres since [[World War II]] with the majority of victims being women and children, as a result of the actions of the [[Assam Movement]].{{sfn|Ghosh|2004|p=312}}{{sfn|Hussain|2009|p=261}}\n\nOne reason cited for this incident is that it resulted from a build-up of resentment over immigration.{{sfn|Datta|2012|p=183}} The Assam movement insisted on striking the names of [[Illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]] from the electoral register and their deportation from the state.
