That evening, the crew of ''Asama Maru'' painted her funnels black and painted out the Japanese flags on her hull and deck.

In 1942 Hey joined the Army Operational Research Group (AORG) after a 6-week course at the Army Radio School. His task was to work on radar anti-jamming methods; for a year German jamming of Allied radar had been a problem and the [[Channel Dash|escape of three German warships]] through the English Channel, aided by enemy [[radar]] jamming from the French Coast, had highlighted the problem. In February 1942 Hey had reports of severe noise jamming of anti-aircraft radars in the 4\u20138 m range. Realizing that the direction of maximum interference seemed to follow the Sun, he checked with the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Observatory]] and found that a very active sunspot was traversing the solar disc. He concluded that a sunspot region, which was believed to emit streams of energetic ions and electrons in magnetic fields of around 100 G (gauss), could emit metre-wave radiation. In 1942, [[George Clark Southworth|G.C. Southworth]] in the USA also linked the Sun with radio noise, this time in the centimetre-wave region.\n\nLater, in 1945, Hey used radar to track the paths of [[V-2 rocket]]s approaching London at about 100 miles high. A problem here arose from spasmodic transient radar echoes at heights of about 60 miles, arriving at a rate of five to 10 per hour. When the V-2 attacks ceased, the echoes did not; Hey concluded that [[meteor]] trails were responsible and that radar could be used to track meteor streams, and could of course do so by day as well as by night.\n\nHey's results of 1942 could not be published until after the war.\n\nHey became Head of the AORG in 1949.

By the end of Lula's administration, entrepreneurs and industrialists began to question the sustainability of these policies. They criticized the shrinking participation of the national industry in the GDP.<ref name=\"book\" />\n\nIn a response to these concerns, Rousseff created the New Economic Matrix in an attempt to help the national industry become more competitive against foreign competition. These measures included tax exemptions and subsidies, which ultimately failed to stimulate industry. Productivity, which had grown by 2.7% in 2010, fell by 0.9% and 3.7% in the next two years, which decreased government revenues, and therefore, public investments.<ref name=\"book\" />\n\n=== Political instability ===\nIn the same year the crisis began, a major corruption scheme was discovered and was being investigated in the [[Operation Car Wash]], which involved top politicians and huge companies, such as the oil giant [[Petrobras]].

By the end of Lula's administration, entrepreneurs and industrialists began to question the sustainability of these policies. They criticized the shrinking participation of the national industry in the GDP.<ref name=\"book\" />\n\nIn a response to these concerns, Rousseff created the New Economic Matrix in an attempt to help the national industry become more competitive against foreign competition. These measures included tax exemptions and subsidies, which ultimately failed to stimulate industry.

Later, the 1989-1992 crisis lasted 11 trimesters and the recovery time was the same: seven trimesters. This crisis, however, had a lower intensity, with an accumulated decrease in the GDP of 7.7%.<ref name=\"book\" />\n\nIn turn, the GDP after the 2014 crisis will only reach its pre-crisis level in 2022, according to an optimistic estimate, with 20 trimesters of recovery in total.
