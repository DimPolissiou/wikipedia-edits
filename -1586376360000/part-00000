The squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012.\n\n=Squadron History=\n\n==1950s==\n\n===Roots===\n[[File:Consolidated PB4Y-2 Naval Aviation Museum.jpg|left|thumb|PB4Y-2 BuNo 66261 (marked as BuNo 66304) in the collection of the [[National Naval Aviation Museum]] at [[Naval Air Station Pensacola|NAS Pensacola]], [[Florida]].]]\nFleet Air Reconnaissance in the European Theater had been conducted since the start of the Cold War by detachments within patrol squadrons (VP) flying modified [[PB4Y-2 Privateer|PB4Y-2 Privateers]]<ref name=\"Donald\">Donald</ref> from [[Naval Air Station Port Lyautey|NAS Port Lyautey]] and conducting missions in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean, and North Seas. These missions occasionally provoked reactions, sometimes hostile, from behind the Iron Curtain. On April 8, 1950, Soviet [[Lavochkin La-11]] fighters shot down a Lyautey-based PB4Y-2 Privateer (BUNO 59645) over the Baltic Sea, off the coast of Liep\u0101ja, Latvia with the loss of all ten aircrew<ref name=\"StaHypo1\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines. Having lost an aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A. By mid-1954, four P4M-1Qs and one [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-2 Neptune]] were at Lyautey. The P2V-2, stripped of ASW equipment, served as a trainer and logistics aircraft<ref name=\"StaHypo2\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

Regular deployment sites were [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik]], [[RAF Mildenhall|Mildehnall], [[Schleswig Air Base|Schleswig], and [[RAF Hal Far|Malta]]<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|title = Cold War Museum|url = http://www.coldwar.org/histories/HistoryofUSNavyFleetAirReconnaissancePartTwo.asp|website = www.coldwar.org|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}</ref>.\n\n===Establishment===\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. At commissioning, Commander Morris L. Kalin led a total complement of 24 officers and 78 enlisted men<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant.]]\n[[File:P2V-5 NAS Jacksonville 1952.jpg|thumb|left|P2V-5 with nose turret in 1952. The Lyautey P2V-5Fs had additional turbojets mounted on nacelles where the rockets are in this photo.]]\nThe squadron continued using the six P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they obtained three Lockheed P2V-5Fs. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same dash speed capability as the P4Ms from two [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nTo give the squadron a ship-based capability allowing its assets to travel with the battle group, in September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron. The A3D-1Q was a reconfigured A3D-1 with the bombay closed and an electronic reconnaissance suite installed similar to those of the P4M-1Q and P2V-5F<ref name=\"Francillon\">Francillon</ref><ref name=\"Heinemann\">Heinemann</ref><ref name=\"Gunston\">Gunston</ref>. The Whale was carrier-capable and had a crew of four<ref name= \"Winchester\">Winchester 2006, p. 75.</ref>. The squadron also received an A3D-1 which it use like the P2V-3<ref name=\"East\" />. With the high tempo of operations and depot-level maintenance for the three models back in the continental United States (CONUS), it is unsurprising that on 1 June 1957, the command had three P4M-1Q,, two A3D-1Q, two P2V-5F, one A3D-1, and one P2V-3 reported in its table of organization (TOE)<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\nThe [[1958 Lebanon crisis|Lebanon Crisis in 1958]] on 15 July 1958, saw a p4M-1Q and aircrew shift south from Incirlik to fly out of Beirut while the US Marines and US Army were deployed there at the behest of [[Camille Chamoun]], the President. VQ-2 operated out of [[Beirut Airport]] through the remainder of the summer and into the fall, departing with the withdrawal of US forces after stabilization in October 1958.\n\n===Homeport Change===\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\nThe relocation of the squadron to Rota began in late 1958 into the first days of 1959. The shift of the squadron CO, XO, and department heads (DHs) was completed by 14 January 1959, but it would take another year to transfer all command assets to Rota<ref name=\"East\" />. All assets at Lyautey had to be surveyed, packed up, and moved. \n\nDuring this evolution, five seven-seat A3D-2Q aircraft arrived to replace the four-seat A3D-1Qs. These new aircraft had the bulkhead between the  cockpit and the bomb bay removed, the bomb bay sealed, and three more seats and equipment added in the former bay.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. This unarmed version (the tail gun had been removed<ref name=\"Francillon\" />) brought an increase in capability to the community.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the eleven aircrew fatalities and three aircraft in three mishaps:\n# On 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach. The aircraft crashed at at 22 St. and E. Ocean Ave., Norfolk, killing four crew and injuring three civilians.<ref name=\"Anderson\">\"Four Missing In Air Crash\", ''The Anderson Independent'', 7 January 1958</ref> Two aircrew were injured and one was uninjured.\n# On 16 October 1958, returning to Incirlik, A3D-1Q (BUNO 130356)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\">{{Cite web|title = All A-3 Skywarriors Produced by Douglas|url =https://www.a3skywarrior.com/ready-room/a-3-dispositions/a-3-production.html|website = www.a3skywarrior.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> crashed near the airfield. All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\n==1960s==\n\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. On 14 January 1960, with all equipment and personnel out of Lyautey, VQ-2 officially transferred to Naval Station. \n\nThe Navy had recognized that the maintenance costs of the aging, worn P4M-1Q and P2V-5F airframes were increasingly more expensive to maintain, and these planes needed replacement. Washington opted for a larger, more capable aircraft, the [[EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. The \"Willie Victors,\" unarmed like the A3D-2Qs<ref name=\":0\" />, could carry a crew of twenty-six. On 26 February 1960, the first two WV-2Q arrived. By the end of the first quarter in 1960, 31 March, VQ-2'aircraft inventory were five A3D-2Q, three P2V-5F, two P4M-1Q, and two WV-2Q. The P2V-5F and P4M-1Q aircraft were soon to be phased out as all hands quickly adapted to the A3D-2Q and WV-2Q airframes. Meanwhile, the\u00b7squadron continued its business of airborne electronic reconnaissance. By the summer of 1960, the Mercators and Neptunes were gone.\n\nOn 18 September 1962, the Department of Defense (DoD) initiated its Tri-Service Aircraft Designation System which replaced the 1922 USN Aircraft Designation System. The new unified system for designating all US military aircraft was a ''Type/Model/Series'' (T/M/S).<ref name=\"TMS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.info/usmilav/aircraft.html|title=Current Designations of U.S. Military Aircraft|website = www.designation-systems.info|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref>. With this change, the A3D-2Q became the EA-3B and the WV-2Q became the EC-121M<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\n===In Theater Operations===\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs with A3D-2Qs filling in as needed<ref name=\":0\" />. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nFollowing the Cuban Missile Crisis was [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. Afterwards, a series of eastern Mediterranean crises provided ample opportunities for VQ-2 to perform timely reconnaissance<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />. A major factor in the more direct tactical reconnaissance shipboard role was the rapidly growing and modernizing Soviet Navy that established a continuous presence in the Mediterranean, concurrent with the Cyprus Crisis. In response to these crises, VQ-2 started operating EA-3B detachments aboard a Mediterranean-based carriers like her sister squadron, VQ-1 did in the Pacific. In January of 1965, the first planes went aboard the [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS Saratoga (CVA-60)]]. Detachments aboardupport to the Mediterranean deployed carriers.\n\nWhile operating in Vietnam and the Philippines, the political tensions in the Middle East and North Africa were building. In June of 1967, armed conflict erupted into the [[Six-Day War]] where Israel defeated its enemies. The loss of the [[USS Liberty]] during the war at the hands of the IDF reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance<ref name=\"East\" />. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cessation of strife in Cyprus. The coup in Libya in 1969 combined with the ever increasing presence of the Soviet Navy to counter the presence of the NATO navies in the Mediterranean kept the command operating at a high tempo.\n\nAs the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe from various NATO bases, from US Sixth Fleet carriers, as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n===Cuban Missile Crisis===\n\nIn October 1962 the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in CONUS<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />, VQ-2 deployed a number of EA-3B and an EC-121M aircraft to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba. After this major superpower crisis was defused, the assets returned to Spain. The squadron's rapidity and flexibility demonstrated in Florida<ref name=\"VQH\" /> kept it very busy when it returned to Europe where it resumed missions in the Mediterranean, Baltic, and central Europe. \n===Vietnam===\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown by EA-3Bs and EC-121Ms into the theater to support US Navy combat operations in Vietnam. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam in 1966, VQ-2 EA-3Bs joined them operating almost exclusively from there as VQ-2 DET BRAVO<ref name=\"East\" />. From both locations, VQ-2 aircraft provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]<ref name=\"East\" />. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the fifty-two aircrew fatalities and five aircraft in seven mishaps.\n# Two days after the official move, on 16 January 1960, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124365) crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there<ref name=\":0\" />.

The aircraft iced up, the engines flamed out, and it stalled into a spin. The pilot ordered the crew to bail out. The four aircrew in the aft compartment bailed. Just as the crew chief was getting ready to go, the pilot got a restart and recovered out of the spin. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA. The other four perished with only one body recovered and the personal effects of the other three.<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /><ref name=\"StaHypo\" />\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> struck the water aft of the ship inbound to a night recovery on the [[USS Independence (CV-62)|USS Independence (CVA-62)]] in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]].

In rough weather in Tokyo Bay on 14 December 1968, the plane broke loose from its tie downs and was lost overboard.\n\n==1970s==\n[[File:EP-3E Orion of VQ-2 parked c1971.jpg|thumb|EP-3E Aries of VQ-2 parked in 1971]]\nOn 26 February 1970, an EA-3B (BUNO 144851)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from [[USS Franklin D.

Four of the crew members died in the accident<ref name=\":2\"/>\n\nVQ-2 continued to operate and maintain EC-121M aircraft into 1974. \n\nIn the second decade of the squadron's forward basing in Spain, the American presence in Rota saw the relocation of the destroyer squadron that had been based in Athens arrive just as the submarine squadron returned to CONUS. <ref name=\"East\"/> The greater availability of assignments at the Aviation Intermediate Maintenance Depot (AIMD) across the hangar fro the squadron saw an increase in \"homesteading\" (remaining at one location as long as one's career would allow) by enlisted personnel as the rate of intermarriage with Spanish host nationals increased.\n\nOn 31 July 1971, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s and the availability of parts.\n\nIncreasing terrorism related to strife in the Middle East and the increasing Libyan radicalization after the 1969 coup led to a continued high operational tempo. Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf.

These missions occasionally provoked reactions, sometimes hostile, from behind the Iron Curtain. On April 8, 1950, Soviet [[Lavochkin La-11]] fighters shot down a Lyautey-based PB4Y-2 Privateer (BUNO 59645) over the Baltic Sea, off the coast of Liep\u0101ja, Latvia with the loss of all ten aircrew<ref name=\"StaHypo1\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines. Having lost an aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A. By mid-1954, four P4M-1Qs and one [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-2 Neptune]] were at Lyautey. The P2V-2, stripped of ASW equipment, served as a trainer and logistics aircraft<ref name=\"StaHypo2\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

Regular deployment sites were [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik]], [[RAF Mildenhall|Mildehnall], [[Schleswig Air Base|Schleswig], and [[RAF Hal Far|Malta]]<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|title = Cold War Museum|url = http://www.coldwar.org/histories/HistoryofUSNavyFleetAirReconnaissancePartTwo.asp|website = www.coldwar.org|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}</ref>.\n\n===Establishment===\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. At commissioning, Commander Morris L. Kalin led a total complement of 24 officers and 78 enlisted men<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant.]]\n[[File:P2V-5 NAS Jacksonville 1952.jpg|thumb|left|P2V-5 with nose turret in 1952. The Lyautey P2V-5Fs had additional turbojets mounted on nacelles where the rockets are in this photo.]]\nThe squadron continued using the six P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they obtained three Lockheed P2V-5Fs. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same dash speed capability as the P4Ms from two [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nTo give the squadron a ship-based capability allowing its assets to travel with the battle group, in September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron. The A3D-1Q was a reconfigured A3D-1 with the bombay closed and an electronic reconnaissance suite installed similar to those of the P4M-1Q and P2V-5F<ref name=\"Francillon\">Francillon</ref><ref name=\"Heinemann\">Heinemann</ref>. The Whale was carrier-capable and had a crew of four<ref name= \"Winchester\">Winchester 2006, p. 75.</ref>. The squadron also received an A3D-1 which it use like the P2V-3<ref name=\"East\" />. With the high tempo of operations and depot-level maintenance for the three models back in the continental United States (CONUS), it is unsurprising that on 1 June 1957, the command had three P4M-1Q,, two A3D-1Q, two P2V-5F, one A3D-1, and one P2V-3 reported in its table of organization (TOE)<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\nThe [[1958 Lebanon crisis|Lebanon Crisis in 1958]] on 15 July 1958, saw a p4M-1Q and aircrew shift south from Incirlik to fly out of Beirut while the US Marines and US Army were deployed there at the behest of [[Camille Chamoun]], the President. VQ-2 operated out of [[Beirut Airport]] through the remainder of the summer and into the fall, departing with the withdrawal of US forces after stabilization in October 1958.\n\n===Homeport Change===\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\nThe relocation of the squadron to Rota began in late 1958 into the first days of 1959. The shift of the squadron CO, XO, and department heads (DHs) was completed by 14 January 1959, but it would take another year to transfer all command assets to Rota<ref name=\"East\" />. All assets at Lyautey had to be surveyed, packed up, and moved. \n\nDuring this evolution, five seven-seat A3D-2Q aircraft arrived to replace the four-seat A3D-1Qs. These new aircraft had the bulkhead between the  cockpit and the bomb bay removed, the bomb bay sealed, and three more seats and equipment added in the former bay.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. This unarmed version (the tail gun had been removed<ref name=\"Francillon\" />) brought an increase in capability to the community.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the eleven aircrew fatalities and three aircraft in three mishaps:\n# On 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\n==1960s==\n\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. On 14 January 1960, with all equipment and personnel out of Lyautey, VQ-2 officially transferred to Naval Station. \n\nThe Navy had recognized that the maintenance costs of the aging, worn P4M-1Q and P2V-5F airframes were increasingly more expensive to maintain, and these planes needed replacement. Washington opted for a larger, more capable aircraft, the [[EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. The \"Willie Victors,\" unarmed like the A3D-2Qs<ref name=\":0\" />, could carry a crew of twenty-six. On 26 February 1960, the first two WV-2Q arrived. By the end of the first quarter in 1960, 31 March, VQ-2'aircraft inventory were five A3D-2Q, three P2V-5F, two P4M-1Q, and two WV-2Q. The P2V-5F and P4M-1Q aircraft were soon to be phased out as all hands quickly adapted to the A3D-2Q and WV-2Q airframes. Meanwhile, the\u00b7squadron continued its business of airborne electronic reconnaissance. By the summer of 1960, the Mercators and Neptunes were gone.\n\nOn 18 September 1962, the Department of Defense (DoD) initiated its Tri-Service Aircraft Designation System which replaced the 1922 USN Aircraft Designation System. The new unified system for designating all US military aircraft was a ''Type/Model/Series'' (T/M/S).<ref name=\"TMS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.info/usmilav/aircraft.html|title=Current Designations of U.S. Military Aircraft|website = www.designation-systems.info|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref>. With this change, the A3D-2Q became the EA-3B and the WV-2Q became the EC-121M<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\n===In Theater Operations===\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs with A3D-2Qs filling in as needed<ref name=\":0\" />. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nFollowing the Cuban Missile Crisis was [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. Afterwards, a series of eastern Mediterranean crises provided ample opportunities for VQ-2 to perform timely reconnaissance<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />. A major factor in the more direct tactical reconnaissance shipboard role was the rapidly growing and modernizing Soviet Navy that established a continuous presence in the Mediterranean, concurrent with the Cyprus Crisis. In response to these crises, VQ-2 started operating EA-3B detachments aboard a Mediterranean-based carriers like her sister squadron, VQ-1 did in the Pacific. In January of 1965, the first planes went aboard the [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS Saratoga (CVA-60)]]. Detachments aboardupport to the Mediterranean deployed carriers.\n\nWhile operating in Vietnam and the Philippines, the political tensions in the Middle East and North Africa were building. In June of 1967, armed conflict erupted into the [[Six-Day War]] where Israel defeated its enemies. The loss of the [[USS Liberty]] during the war at the hands of the IDF reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance<ref name=\"East\" />. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cessation of strife in Cyprus. The coup in Libya in 1969 combined with the ever increasing presence of the Soviet Navy to counter the presence of the NATO navies in the Mediterranean kept the command operating at a high tempo.\n\nAs the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe from various NATO bases, from US Sixth Fleet carriers, as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n===Cuban Missile Crisis===\n\nIn October 1962 the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in CONUS<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />, VQ-2 deployed a number of EA-3B and an EC-121M aircraft to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba. After this major superpower crisis was defused, the assets returned to Spain. The squadron's rapidity and flexibility demonstrated in Florida<ref name=\"VQH\" /> kept it very busy when it returned to Europe where it resumed missions in the Mediterranean, Baltic, and central Europe. \n===Vietnam===\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown by EA-3Bs and EC-121Ms into the theater to support US Navy combat operations in Vietnam. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam in 1966, VQ-2 EA-3Bs joined them operating almost exclusively from there as VQ-2 DET BRAVO<ref name=\"East\" />. From both locations, VQ-2 aircraft provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]<ref name=\"East\" />. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the fifty-two aircrew fatalities and five aircraft in seven mishaps.\n# Two days after the official move, on 16 January 1960, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124365) crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there<ref name=\":0\" />.

It occurred in the [[Plaza de las Tres Culturas]] in the [[Tlatelolco, Mexico City|Tlatelolco]] section of [[Mexico City]]. The events are considered part of the [[Mexican Dirty War]], when the government used its forces to suppress political opposition.

It was a time of great hope, seemingly on the verge of transformation. Students were out in the streets, in the plazas, on the buses, forming brigades, \"going to the people.\" There were movement committees at each school and heady experiences of argument, exploration, and democratic practice. There was no central leader. Families were drawn in, whole apartment buildings and neighborhoods. A revolution was happening - not [[Che Guevara|Che]]'s revolution - but a revolution from within the system, nonviolent, driven by euphoria, conviction, and the excitement of experimentation on the ground.\n | source = \u2014 ''[[Dissent (American magazine)|Dissent Magazine]]''<ref>[http://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/?article=582 From Che to Marcos] by Jeffrey W.

September 23, 1968.</ref> Mexican President [[Gustavo D\u00edaz Ordaz]] struggled to maintain public order during a time of rising social tensions but suppressed movements by labor unions and farmers fighting to improve their lot. His administration suppressed independent labor unions, farmers, and was heavy-handed in trying to direct the economy. In 1958 under the previous administration of [[Adolfo L\u00f3pez Mateos]], when D\u00edaz Ordaz was Minister of the Interior, labor leader [[Demetrio Vallejo]] was arrested and peasant activist Rub\u00e9n Jaramillo was murdered.<ref name=\"Poniatowska 1991\">Poniatowska, Elena.

Lane Columbia: University of Missouri Press, 1991.</ref>\n\nArising from reaction to the government's violent repression of a July 1968 fight between rival ''porros'' (gangs), the student movement in Mexico City quickly grew to include large segments of the university students who were dissatisfied with the regime of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]], most especially at the [[Autonomous National University of Mexico]] (UNAM), and the [[National Polytechnic Institute]] (IPN) as well as other universities. After a fight by rival student groups in central Mexico City was broken up violently by a large contingent of police, university students formed a [[National Strike Council]] to organize protests and present demands to the government. Large-scale protests grew in size over the summer as the opening of the Olympic Games in mid October grew nearer.  Minister of the Interior [[Luis Echeverr\u00eda]] needed to keep public order. On October 2, 1968, a large peaceful march arrived at the Plaza of the Three Cultures for the usual speeches.  However, the D\u00edaz Ordaz government had had enough, and troops marched into the plaza and gunmen in surrounding buildings opened fire on the unarmed civilians in what is now known as the Tlatelolco massacre.\n\n==Massacre==\n[[File:14_primera_confer\u00e8ncia_de_premsa_despr\u00e9s_de_la_masacre_del_2_d'octubre,_5_d'octubre_de_1968.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Marcelino Perell\u00f3 leader of student groups at a Press Conference.

''Encyclopedia of Mexico: History, Society & Culture''. Vol. 2 Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, 1997.</ref> Many men and women not associated with the CNH gathered in the plaza to watch and listen; they included neighbors from the Residential complex, bystanders and children. The students had congregated outside the Chihuahua Building, a three-moduled thirteen-story apartment complex in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas. Among their chants were ''\u00a1No queremos olimpiadas, queremos revoluci\u00f3n!'' (\"We don't want Olympics, we want revolution!\"). Rally organizers did not try to call off the protest when they noticed an increased military presence in the area.\n\n[[File:Manifestaci\u00f3_27_d'agost.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Students' demonstration, Mexico City, August 27th, 1968.]]\nTwo helicopters, one from the police, and another one from the army, flew over the plaza. Around 5:55 P.M. red flares were shot from the nearby S.R.E. (Mexican Ministry of Foreign Relations) tower. Around 6:15 P.M. another two flares were shot, this time from a helicopter (one was green and another one was red) as 5,000 soldiers, 200 [[tankettes]]<ref name=\"Tlatelolco\">Canal 6 de Julio, Tlatelolco: Las Claves de la Masacre</ref> and trucks surrounded the plaza.<ref name=\"Werner, Michael S. 1997\"/> Much of what proceeded after the first shots were fired in the plaza remained ill-defined for decades after 1968. Records and information released by American and Mexican government sources since 2000 have enabled researchers to study the events and draw new conclusions.\n\nThe question of who fired first remained unresolved years after the massacre. The Mexican government said gunfire from the surrounding apartments prompted the army's attack. But the students said that the helicopters appeared to signal the army to fire into the crowd. Journalist [[Elena Poniatowska]] culled interviews from those present and described events in her book ''Massacre in Mexico'': \"Flares suddenly appeared in the sky overhead and everyone automatically looked up. The first shots were heard then. The crowd panicked\u2026[and] started running in all directions.\"<ref name=\"Poniatowska 1991\"/> Despite CNH efforts to restore order, the crowd on the plaza quickly fell into chaos.\n\nShortly thereafter, the Olympia Battalion, a secret government branch made for the security of the Olympic Games composed of soldiers, police officers, and federal security agents,<ref name=\"Tlatelolco\" /> were ordered to arrest the leaders of the CNH and advanced into the plaza. The Olympia Battalion members wore white gloves or white handkerchiefs tied to their left hands to distinguish themselves from the civilians and prevent the soldiers from shooting them.<ref name=\"Poniatowska 1991\"/> Captain Ernesto Morales Soto stated that \"immediately upon sighting a flare in the sky, the prearranged signal, we were to seal off the aforementioned two entrances and prevent anyone from entering or leaving.\"<ref name=\"Poniatowska 1991\"/>\n\nThe ensuing assault into the plaza left dozens dead and many more wounded in its aftermath.  The soldiers responded by firing into the nearby buildings and into the crowd, hitting not only the protesters, but also watchers and bystanders. Demonstrators and passersby alike, including students, journalists (one of which was Italian reporter [[Oriana Fallaci]]), and children, were hit by bullets, and mounds of bodies soon lay on the ground. Meanwhile, on the Chihuahua building, where the speakers stood, Olympia Battalion members pushed people and ordered them to lie on the ground near the elevator walls. People claim these men were the people who shot first at the soldiers and the crowd.<ref name=\"Tlatelolco\" />\n\n[[Image:Estudiantes sobre cammi\u00f3n quemado (A68).JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Students in a burned bus.]]\n\nVideo evidence also points out that at least two companies of the Olympia Battalion hid themselves in the nearby apartment buildings and set up a machine gun in an apartment on the Molino del Rey Building, where a sister-in-law of then-Secretary of State [[Luis Echeverr\u00eda]] lived; the church of Santiago de Tlatelolco, where snipers were positioned into the roof; the nearby convent and the Foreign Relations Tower, where there were many people involved including the ones who fired the first two flares; a machine gun on the 19th floor; and a video camera on the 17th floor. Video evidence shows 10 white-gloved men leaving the church and bumping into soldiers, who point their weapons at them. One of the men shows what appears to be an ID, and they are let go.<ref name=\"Tlatelolco\" />\n\n[[File:L'ex\u00e8rcit_al_carrer_30_de_juliol.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Mexican soldiers at the streets. the 30th july, 1968]]\n\nThe killing continued throughout the night, with soldiers and policemen operating on a house-to-house basis in the apartment buildings adjacent to the square. The Chihuahua Building as well as the rest of the neighborhood had its electricity and phones cut off. Witnesses to the event claim that the bodies were first removed in ambulances and later military officials came and piled up bodies, not knowing if they were dead or alive, into the military trucks, while some say that the bodies were piled up on garbage trucks and sent to unknown destinations. The soldiers rounded up the students onto the Chihuahua Building's elevator walls, stripped them, and beat them.\n\n3,000 attendees were taken to the convent next to the church and were left there until early in the morning, most of these being people that had little to nothing in common with the students and were only neighbors, bystanders, passersby and others who were on the plaza just to listen to the speech. Other witnesses claim that in the later days, Olympia Battalion members would disguise themselves as utilities employees and inspect the houses in search of students.\n\nThe official government explanation of the incident was that armed provocateurs among the demonstrators, stationed in buildings overlooking the crowd, had begun the firefight. Suddenly finding themselves sniper targets, the security forces had simply returned the shooting in self-defense. By the next morning, newspapers reported that 20 to 28 people had been killed, hundreds wounded, and hundreds more arrested.<ref name=\"Poniatowska 1991\"/>\n\nMost of the Mexican media reported that the students provoked the army's murderous response with sniper fire from the apartment buildings surrounding the plaza. ''El D\u00eda''{{'}}s morning headline on October 3, 1968, read as followed: \"Criminal Provocation at the Tlatelolco Meeting Causes Terrible Bloodshed.\" The government-controlled media reported the Mexican government's side of the events that night, but the truth eventually emerged: A 2001 investigation revealed documents showing that the snipers were members of the Presidential Guard, who were instructed to fire on the military forces [[Agent provocateur|in order to provoke them]].<ref name=\"npr1dec\">[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97546687 Mexico's 1968 Massacre: What Really Happened?] ''All Things Considered'', National Public Radio. 1 December 2008.

However, the PRI government continued its recalcitrance and did not release official government documents pertaining to the incident. In a 2002 ''All Things Considered'' radio interview with Kate Doyle, director of the Mexican Documentation Project for the US National Security Archive, she described the PRI government's investigations: \"I mean, there have been a number of investigations throughout the years. In fact, former [[Miguel de la Madrid|President Miguel de la Madrid]] was interviewed yesterday in the press, and said that he had asked the military and the interior secretary for documents and for photographs of the demonstrations, and was subjected to tremendous political pressure not to investigate. And when he continued to press, the military and the interior ministry claimed that their files were in disarray and they had nothing.\"<ref name=\"All Things Considered 2002\">''All Things Considered'', National Public Radio, February 14, 2002.</ref>\n\nEnduring questions remained after \"La Noche Triste\" (the Sad Night) that have taken the Mexican government over 30 years to answer. Eventually in 2001, President Vicente Fox, the president who ended the 70-year reign of the PRI, attempted to resolve the question of who had orchestrated the massacre.

Well, there's been pretty clear evidence now that there was a unit that was called the ''Brigada Ol\u00edmpica'', or the Olympic Brigade, that was made up of special forces of the presidential guard, who opened fire from the buildings that surrounded the square, and that that was the thing that provoked the massacre.<ref name=\"All Things Considered 2002\"/></blockquote>\n\nPresident Fox also appointed Ignacio Carrillo Prieto in 2002 to prosecute those responsible for ordering the massacre.<ref>Kevin Sullivan, \"Mexico to Seek Genocide Charges Against Officials in 1968 Massacre\", ''Washington Post'', January 14, 2005.</ref> In 2006, former President [[Luis Echeverr\u00eda]] was arrested on charges of genocide. However, in March 2009, after a convoluted appeal process, the genocide charges against Echeverria were dismissed.

Students were out in the streets, in the plazas, on the buses, forming brigades, \"going to the people.\" There were movement committees at each school and heady experiences of argument, exploration, and democratic practice. There was no central leader. Families were drawn in, whole apartment buildings and neighborhoods.

His administration suppressed independent labor unions, farmers, and was heavy-handed in trying to direct the economy. In 1958 under the previous administration of [[Adolfo L\u00f3pez Mateos]], when D\u00edaz Ordaz was Minister of the Interior, labor leader [[Demetrio Vallejo]] was arrested and peasant activist Rub\u00e9n Jaramillo was murdered.<ref name=\"Poniatowska 1991\">Poniatowska, Elena.

After a fight by rival student groups in central Mexico City was broken up violently by a large contingent of police, university students formed a [[National Strike Council]] to organize protests and present demands to the government. Large-scale protests on grew in size over the summer as the opening of the Olympic Games in mid October grew nearer.  Minister of the Interior [[Luis Echeverr\u00eda]] needed to keep public order. On October 2, 1968, a large peaceful march arrived at the Plaza of the Three Cultures for the usual speeches.  However, the D\u00edaz Ordaz government had had enough, and troops marched into the plaza and gunmen in surrounding buildings opened fire on the unarmed civilians in what is now known as the Tlatelolco massacre.\n\n==Massacre==\n[[File:14_primera_confer\u00e8ncia_de_premsa_despr\u00e9s_de_la_masacre_del_2_d'octubre,_5_d'octubre_de_1968.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Marcelino Perell\u00f3 leader of student groups at a Press Conference.

''Encyclopedia of Mexico: History, Society & Culture''. Vol. 2 Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, 1997.</ref> Many men and women not associated with the CNH gathered in the plaza to watch and listen; they included neighbors from the Residential complex, bystanders and children. The students had congregated outside the Chihuahua Building, a three-moduled thirteen-story apartment complex in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas. Among their chants were ''\u00a1No queremos olimpiadas, queremos revoluci\u00f3n!'' (\"We don't want Olympics, we want revolution!\"). Rally organizers did not try to call off the protest when they noticed an increased military presence in the area.\n\n[[File:Manifestaci\u00f3_27_d'agost.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Students' demonstration, Mexico City, August 27th, 1968.]]\nTwo helicopters, one from the police, and another one from the army, flew over the plaza. Around 5:55 P.M. red flares were shot from the nearby S.R.E. (Mexican Ministry of Foreign Relations) tower. Around 6:15 P.M. another two flares were shot, this time from a helicopter (one was green and another one was red) as 5,000 soldiers, 200 [[tankettes]]<ref name=\"Tlatelolco\">Canal 6 de Julio, Tlatelolco: Las Claves de la Masacre</ref> and trucks surrounded the plaza.<ref name=\"Werner, Michael S. 1997\"/> Much of what proceeded after the first shots were fired in the plaza remained ill-defined for decades after 1968. Records and information released by American and Mexican government sources since 2000 have enabled researchers to study the events and draw new conclusions.\n\nThe question of who fired first remained unresolved years after the massacre. The Mexican government said gunfire from the surrounding apartments prompted the army's attack. But the students said that the helicopters appeared to signal the army to fire into the crowd. Journalist [[Elena Poniatowska]] culled interviews from those present and described events in her book ''Massacre in Mexico'': \"Flares suddenly appeared in the sky overhead and everyone automatically looked up. The first shots were heard then. The crowd panicked\u2026[and] started running in all directions.\"<ref name=\"Poniatowska 1991\"/> Despite CNH efforts to restore order, the crowd on the plaza quickly fell into chaos.\n\nShortly thereafter, the Olympia Battalion, a secret government branch made for the security of the Olympic Games composed of soldiers, police officers, and federal security agents,<ref name=\"Tlatelolco\" /> were ordered to arrest the leaders of the CNH and advanced into the plaza. The Olympia Battalion members wore white gloves or white handkerchiefs tied to their left hands to distinguish themselves from the civilians and prevent the soldiers from shooting them.<ref name=\"Poniatowska 1991\"/> Captain Ernesto Morales Soto stated that \"immediately upon sighting a flare in the sky, the prearranged signal, we were to seal off the aforementioned two entrances and prevent anyone from entering or leaving.\"<ref name=\"Poniatowska 1991\"/>\n\nThe ensuing assault into the plaza left dozens dead and many more wounded in its aftermath.  The soldiers responded by firing into the nearby buildings and into the crowd, hitting not only the protesters, but also watchers and bystanders. Demonstrators and passersby alike, including students, journalists (one of which was Italian reporter [[Oriana Fallaci]]), and children, were hit by bullets, and mounds of bodies soon lay on the ground. Meanwhile, on the Chihuahua building, where the speakers stood, Olympia Battalion members pushed people and ordered them to lie on the ground near the elevator walls. People claim these men were the people who shot first at the soldiers and the crowd.<ref name=\"Tlatelolco\" />\n\n[[Image:Estudiantes sobre cammi\u00f3n quemado (A68).JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Students in a burned bus.]]\n\nVideo evidence also points out that at least two companies of the Olympia Battalion hid themselves in the nearby apartment buildings and set up a machine gun in an apartment on the Molino del Rey Building, where a sister-in-law of then-Secretary of State [[Luis Echeverr\u00eda]] lived; the church of Santiago de Tlatelolco, where snipers were positioned into the roof; the nearby convent and the Foreign Relations Tower, where there were many people involved including the ones who fired the first two flares; a machine gun on the 19th floor; and a video camera on the 17th floor. Video evidence shows 10 white-gloved men leaving the church and bumping into soldiers, who point their weapons at them. One of the men shows what appears to be an ID, and they are let go.<ref name=\"Tlatelolco\" />\n\n[[File:L'ex\u00e8rcit_al_carrer_30_de_juliol.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Mexican soldiers at the streets. the 30th july, 1968]]\n\nThe killing continued throughout the night, with soldiers and policemen operating on a house-to-house basis in the apartment buildings adjacent to the square. The Chihuahua Building as well as the rest of the neighborhood had its electricity and phones cut off. Witnesses to the event claim that the bodies were first removed in ambulances and later military officials came and piled up bodies, not knowing if they were dead or alive, into the military trucks, while some say that the bodies were piled up on garbage trucks and sent to unknown destinations. The soldiers rounded up the students onto the Chihuahua Building's elevator walls, stripped them, and beat them.\n\n3,000 attendees were taken to the convent next to the church and were left there until early in the morning, most of these being people that had little to nothing in common with the students and were only neighbors, bystanders, passersby and others who were on the plaza just to listen to the speech. Other witnesses claim that in the later days, Olympia Battalion members would disguise themselves as utilities employees and inspect the houses in search of students.\n\nThe official government explanation of the incident was that armed provocateurs among the demonstrators, stationed in buildings overlooking the crowd, had begun the firefight. Suddenly finding themselves sniper targets, the security forces had simply returned the shooting in self-defense.

However, the PRI government continued its recalcitrance and did not release official government documents pertaining to the incident. In a 2002 ''All Things Considered'' radio interview with Kate Doyle, director of the Mexican Documentation Project for the US National Security Archive, she described the PRI government's investigations: \"I mean, there have been a number of investigations throughout the years. In fact, former [[Miguel de la Madrid|President Miguel de la Madrid]] was interviewed yesterday in the press, and said that he had asked the military and the interior secretary for documents and for photographs of the demonstrations, and was subjected to tremendous political pressure not to investigate. And when he continued to press, the military and the interior ministry claimed that their files were in disarray and they had nothing.\"<ref name=\"All Things Considered 2002\">''All Things Considered'', National Public Radio, February 14, 2002.</ref>\n\nEnduring questions remained after \"La Noche Triste\" (the Sad Night) that have taken the Mexican government over 30 years to answer. Eventually in 2001, President Vicente Fox, the president who ended the 70-year reign of the PRI, attempted to resolve the question of who had orchestrated the massacre. President Fox ordered the release of previously classified documents concerning the 1968 massacre.<ref>Morning Edition, National Public Radio, April 22, 2002.</ref> The documents revealed that Elena Poniatowska's synthesis of the events that October night was accurate, as Kate Doyle uncovered, <blockquote>Thousands of students gathered in the square and, as you say, the government version is that the students opened fire. Well, there's been pretty clear evidence now that there was a unit that was called the ''Brigada Ol\u00edmpica'', or the Olympic Brigade, that was made up of special forces of the presidential guard, who opened fire from the buildings that surrounded the square, and that that was the thing that provoked the massacre.<ref name=\"All Things Considered 2002\"/></blockquote>\n\nPresident Fox also appointed Ignacio Carrillo Prieto in 2002 to prosecute those responsible for ordering the massacre.<ref>Kevin Sullivan, \"Mexico to Seek Genocide Charges Against Officials in 1968 Massacre\", ''Washington Post'', January 14, 2005.</ref> In 2006, former President [[Luis Echeverr\u00eda]] was arrested on charges of genocide. However, in March 2009, after a convoluted appeal process, the genocide charges against Echeverria were dismissed.

Six days before the massacre at Tlatelolco, both Echeverr\u00eda and head of Federal Security (DFS) [[Fernando Guti\u00e9rrez Barrios]] told the CIA that \"the situation will be under complete control very shortly\".\n* That the D\u00edaz Ordaz government \"arranged\" to have student leader S\u00f3crates Campos Lemus accuse dissident [[Partido Revolucionario Institucional|PRI]] politicians such as [[Carlos Madrazo]] of funding and orchestrating the student movement.\n\n== Remembrance ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}\n[[File:Marcha2oct2014 ohs27.jpg|thumb|Demonstration marking the Tlatelolco massacre, October 2, 2014]]\nIn 1993, in remembrance of the 25th anniversary of the events, a [[stele]] was dedicated with the names of a few of the students and persons who lost their lives during the event.

was a British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] statesman who served as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] from 1902 to 1905. As [[Foreign Secretary]] in the [[Lloyd George ministry]], he issued the [[Balfour Declaration]] in 1917 on behalf of the cabinet.\n\nEntering Parliament in [[1874 United Kingdom general election|1874]], Balfour achieved prominence as [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]], in which position he suppressed agrarian unrest whilst taking measures against absentee landlords. He opposed [[Irish Home Rule movement|Irish Home Rule]], saying there could be no half-way house between Ireland remaining within the United Kingdom or becoming independent. From 1891 he led the Conservative Party in the House of Commons, serving under his uncle, [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], whose government won large majorities in [[1895 United Kingdom general election|1895]] and [[1900 United Kingdom general election|1900]]. An esteemed debater, he was bored by the mundane tasks of party management.\n\nIn July 1902 he succeeded his uncle as Prime Minister. In domestic policy he passed the [[Irish Land Acts|Irish Land Act 1903]], which bought out most of the Anglo-Irish land owners. The [[Education Act 1902]] had a major long-term impact in modernising the school system in England and Wales and provided financial support for schools operated by the Church of England and by the Catholic Church. Nonconformists were outraged and mobilized their voters, but were unable to reverse it. In foreign and defence policy, he oversaw reform of British defence policy and supported [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Jackie Fisher]]'s naval innovations. He secured the [[Entente Cordiale]] with France, an alliance that isolated Germany. He cautiously embraced [[imperial preference]] as championed by [[Joseph Chamberlain]], but resignations from the Cabinet over the abandonment of free trade left his party divided. He also suffered from public anger at the later stages of the [[Boer war]] (counter-insurgency warfare characterized as \"methods of barbarism\") and the importation of Chinese labour to South Africa (\"Chinese slavery\"). He resigned as Prime Minister in December 1905 and the following month the Conservatives suffered a landslide defeat at the [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906 election]], in which he lost his own seat. He soon re-entered Parliament and continued to serve as Leader of the Opposition throughout the crisis over Lloyd George's [[People's Budget|1909 budget]], the narrow loss of two further General Elections in 1910, and the passage of the [[Parliament Act 1911]]. He resigned as party leader in 1911.\n\nBalfour returned as [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] in Asquith's Coalition Government (1915\u201316). In December 1916 he became Foreign Secretary in [[David Lloyd George]]'s coalition. He was frequently left out of the inner workings of foreign policy, although the [[Balfour Declaration]] on a Jewish homeland bore his name. He continued to serve in senior positions throughout the 1920s, and died on 19 March 1930 aged 81, having spent a vast inherited fortune. He never married. Balfour trained as a philosopher \u2013 he originated an argument against believing that human reason could determine truth \u2013 and was seen as having a detached attitude to life, epitomised by a remark attributed to him: \"Nothing matters very much and few things matter at all\".\n\n==Background and early life==\n[[File:Lord Balfour's childhood home.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Whittingehame House]]\nArthur Balfour was born at [[Whittingehame|Whittingehame House]], East Lothian, Scotland, the eldest son of [[James Maitland Balfour]] (1820\u20131856) and [[Lady Blanche Gascoyne-Cecil]] (1825\u20131872). His father was a Scottish MP, as was his grandfather [[James Balfour (died 1845)|James]]; his mother, a member of the [[Marquess of Salisbury|Cecil family]] descended from [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury]], was the daughter of the [[James Gascoyne-Cecil, 2nd Marquess of Salisbury|2nd Marquess of Salisbury]] and a sister to the [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|3rd Marquess]], the future Prime Minister.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=250}} His godfather was the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], after whom he was named.<ref name=Tuch46>{{cite book|author-link=Barbara Tuchman|first=Barbara |last=Tuchman |title=The Proud Tower|title-link=The Proud Tower| p= [https://archive.org/details/proudtowerportr00tuch/page/46 46]|date=1966|publisher=Macmillan}}</ref> He was the eldest son, third of eight children, and had four brothers and three sisters.

He then went up to the [[University of Cambridge]], where he read [[moral sciences]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] (1866\u20131869),<ref>{{acad|id=BLFR866AJ|name=Balfour, Arthur}}</ref> graduating with a [[British undergraduate degree classification|second-class honours]] degree.

After her two previous serious suitors had died, Balfour is said to have declared his love for her in December 1874. She died of [[typhus]] on Palm Sunday, March 1875; Balfour arranged for an emerald ring to be buried in her coffin. Lavinia Talbot, May's older sister, believed that an engagement had been imminent, but her recollections of Balfour's distress (he was \"staggered\") were not written down until thirty years later. The historian [[R. J. Q. Adams]] points out that May's letters discuss her love life in detail, but contain no evidence that she was in love with Balfour, nor that he had spoken to her of marriage. He visited her only once during her serious three-month illness, and was soon accepting social invitations again within a month of her death. Adams suggests that, although he may simply have been too shy to express his feelings fully, Balfour may also have encouraged tales of his youthful tragedy as a convenient cover for his disinclination to marry; the matter cannot be conclusively proven.<ref name=\"Adams2007\">{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Ralph James Q. |authorlink=R.

In spring 1878, he became [[Parliamentary Private Secretary|Private Secretary]] to his uncle, [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]. He accompanied Salisbury (then Foreign Secretary) to the [[Congress of Berlin]] and gained his first experience in international politics in connection with the settlement of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|Russo-Turkish conflict]]. At the same time he became known in the world of letters; the academic subtlety and literary achievement of his ''Defence of Philosophic Doubt'' (1879) suggested he might make a reputation as a philosopher.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=250\u2013251}}\n\nBalfour divided his time between politics and academic pursuits. Biographer Sydney Zebel suggested that Belfour continued to appear an amateur or dabbler in public affairs, devoid of ambition and indifferent to policy issues. However, in fact he actually made a dramatic transition to a deeply involved politician. His assets, according to Zebel, included a strong ambition that he kept hidden, shrewd political judgment, a knack for negotiation, a taste for intrigue, and care to avoid factionalism. Most importantly, he deepened his close ties with his uncle Lord Salisbury. He also maintained cordial relationships with Disraeli, Gladstone and other national leaders.<ref name=\"Zebel1973\">{{cite book|first=Sydney Henry |last=Zebel|title=Balfour: A Political Biography|url=https://archive.org/details/balfourpolitical00zebe|url-access=registration |year=1973|publisher=University Press|isbn=978-0-521-08536-6|location=Cambridge}}</ref>{{rp|27}}\n\nReleased from his duties as private secretary by the [[1880 United Kingdom general election|1880 general election]], he began to take more part in parliamentary affairs.

Balfour also helped the poor by creating the [[Congested Districts Board for Ireland]] in 1890. In 1886\u20131892 he became one of the most effective public speakers of the age. Impressive in matter rather than delivery, his speeches were logical and convincing, and delighted an ever-wider audience.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=251}}\n\nOn the death of [[William Henry Smith (1825\u20131891)|W. H. Smith]] in 1891, Balfour became [[First Lord of the Treasury]] \u2013 the last in British history not to have been concurrently Prime Minister as well \u2013 and [[Leader of the House of Commons]]. After the fall of the government in 1892 he spent three years in opposition. When the Conservatives returned to power, in coalition with the Liberal Unionists, in 1895, Balfour again became Leader of the House and First Lord of the Treasury. His management of the abortive education proposals of 1896 showed a disinclination for the drudgery of parliamentary management, yet he saw the passage of a bill providing Ireland with improved local government under the [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898]] and joined in debates on foreign and domestic questions between 1895 and 1900.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=251}}\n\nDuring the illness of Lord Salisbury in 1898, and again in Salisbury's absence abroad, Balfour was in charge of the [[Foreign Office]], and he conducted negotiations with Russia on the question of railways in North China. As a member of the cabinet responsible for the [[Second Boer War|Transvaal negotiations]] in 1899, he bore his share of controversy and, when the [[Second Boer War|war]] began disastrously, he was first to realise the need to use the country's full military strength. His leadership of the House was marked by firmness in the suppression of obstruction, yet there was a slight revival of the criticisms of 1896.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=251}}\n\n==Prime Minister==\n<!-- linked from redirects [[Premiership of Arthur Balfour]], [[Prime ministership of Arthur Balfour]] -->\n{{Further|Balfour ministry}}<!-- please do not change this link to [[Unionist government, 1895\u20131905]] -->\n[[File:Arthur-James-Balfour-1st-Earl-of-Balfour.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait by [[George Charles Beresford]], 1902]]\nWith Lord Salisbury's resignation on 11 July 1902, Balfour succeeded him as Prime Minister, with the approval of all the Unionist party. The new Prime Minister came into power practically at the same moment as the [[coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra]] and the end of the [[South African War]]. The Liberal party was still disorganised over the Boers.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=252}}\n\nIn foreign affairs, Balfour and his Foreign Secretary, [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne|Lord Lansdowne]], improved relations with France, culminating in the [[Entente Cordiale]] of 1904. The period also saw the [[Russo-Japanese War]], when Britain, an ally of the Japanese, came close to war with Russia after the [[Dogger Bank incident]]. On the whole, Balfour left the conduct of foreign policy to Lansdowne, being busy himself with domestic problems.<ref name=\"Zebel1973\" />\n\nBalfour, who had known Zionist leader [[Chaim Weizmann]] since 1906, opposed Russian mistreatment of Jews and increasingly supported Zionism as a programme for European Jews to settle in Palestine.<ref>{{cite book|first=Milton |last=Viorst|title=Zionism: The Birth and Transformation of an Ideal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=frLPCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA80|year=2016|page=80|isbn=9781466890329}}</ref> However, in 1905 he supported the [[Aliens Act 1905]], one of whose main objectives was to control and restrict Jewish immigration from Eastern Europe.<ref>{{cite book|first=Shlomo|last= Sand|title= The Invention of the Land of Israel: From Holy Land to Homeland|location=London|publisher= Verso|date= 2012|pp= 14\u201315}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Sabbagh | first=Karl | title=Palestine : a personal history | publisher=Atlantic | location=London | year=2006 | isbn=978-1-84354-344-2 | page= 103 | quote = Balfour warned the House of Commons in his speech of 'the undoubted evils that had fallen upon the country from an immigration which was largely Jewish'}}</ref>\n\nThe budget was certain to show a surplus and taxation could be remitted. Yet as events proved, it was the budget that would sow dissension, override other legislative concerns and signal a new political movement. [[Charles Thomson Ritchie]]'s remission of the shilling import-duty on corn led to [[Joseph Chamberlain]]'s crusade in favour of tariff reform. These were taxes on imported goods with [[trade preference]] given to the Empire, to protect British industry from competition, strengthen the Empire in the face of growing German and American economic power, and provide revenue, other than raising taxes, for the social welfare legislation. As the session proceeded, the rift grew in the Unionist ranks.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=252}} Tariff reform was popular with Unionist supporters, but the threat of higher prices for food imports made the policy an electoral albatross. Hoping to split the difference between the free traders and tariff reformers in his cabinet and party, Balfour favoured retaliatory tariffs to punish others who had tariffs against the British, in the hope of encouraging global free trade.\nThis was not sufficient for either the free traders or the extreme tariff reformers in government. With Balfour's agreement, Chamberlain resigned from the Cabinet in late 1903 to campaign for tariff reform. At the same time, Balfour tried to balance the two factions by accepting the resignation of three free-trading ministers, including Chancellor Ritchie, but the almost simultaneous resignation of the free-trader Duke of Devonshire (who as Lord Hartington had been the Liberal Unionist leader of the 1880s) left Balfour's Cabinet weak. By 1905 few Unionist MPs were still free traders (Winston Churchill crossed to the Liberals in 1904 when threatened with deselection at Oldham), but Balfour's act had drained his authority within the government.<ref name=\"Zebel1973\" />\n\nBalfour resigned as Prime Minister in December 1905, hoping the Liberal leader [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman|Campbell-Bannerman]] would be unable to form a strong government. This was dashed when Campbell-Bannerman faced down an attempt (\"[[The Relugas Compact]]\") to \"kick him upstairs\" to the House of Lords. The Conservatives were defeated by the Liberals at the general election the following January (in terms of MPs, a Liberal landslide), with Balfour losing his seat at [[Manchester East (UK Parliament constituency)|Manchester East]] to [[Thomas Gardner Horridge]], a solicitor and [[king's counsel]]. Only 157 Conservatives were returned to the Commons, at least two-thirds followers of Chamberlain, who chaired the Conservative MPs until Balfour won a safe seat in the [[City of London (UK Parliament constituency)|City of London]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=254}}\n\n===Achievements and mistakes===\nAccording to historian [[Robert Ensor]], writing in 1936, Balfour can be credited with achievement in five major areas:<ref name=\"Ensor1936\">{{cite book|first=R.

Ensor said the Act ranked:\n{{quote|among the two or three greatest constructive measures of the twentieth century....[He did not write it] but no statesman less dominated than Balfour was by the concept of national efficiency would have taken it up and carried it through, since its cost on the side of votes was obvious and deterrent....Public money was thus made available for the first time to ensure properly paid teachers and a standardized level of efficiency for all children alike [including the Anglican and Catholic schools].<ref name=\"Ensor1936\" />{{rp|355\u201356}}\n}}\n\nFor most of the 19th century, the very powerful political and economic position of the [[Church of Ireland]] (Anglican) landowners blocked the political aspirations of Irish nationalists, who by 1900 included both Catholic and Presbyterian elements. Balfour's solution was to buy them out, not by compulsion, but by offering the owners a full immediate payment and a 12% bonus on the sales price.  The British government purchased 13 million acres (53,000 km2) by 1920,  and sold farms to the tenants at low payments spread over seven decades. It would cost money, but all sides proved amenable.<ref name=\"Ensor1936\" />{{rp|358\u201360}}  Starting in 1923 the Irish government bought out most of the remaining landowners, and in 1933 diverted payments being made to the British treasury and used them for local improvements.<ref name=\"Lee1989\">{{cite book|first=J.

Chamberlain proposed to turn the Empire into a closed [[trade bloc]] protected by high tariffs against imports from Germany and the United States. He argued that tariff reform would revive a flagging British economy, strengthen imperial ties with the dominions and the colonies, and produce a positive programme that would facilitate reelection. He was vehemently opposed by Conservative free traders who denounced the proposal as economically fallacious, and open to the charge of raising food prices in Britain. Balfour tried to forestall disruption by removing key ministers on each side, and offering a much narrower tariff programme. It was ingenious, but both sides rejected any compromise, and his party's chances for reelection were ruined.<ref name=\"Goodlad2010\" /><ref name=\"PearceGoodlad2013\">{{cite book|first1=Robert|last1= Pearce |first2=Graham|last2= Goodlad|title=British Prime Ministers From Balfour to Brown|date=2013}}</ref>{{rp|4\u20136}}\n\nBalfour may have been personally sympathetic to extending suffrage, with his brother Gerald, Conservative MP for Leeds Central married to women's suffrage activist [[Lady Constance Bulwer-Lytton|Constance Lytton]]'s sister Betty.<ref name=\":0\" /> But he accepted the strength of the political opposition to women's suffrage, as shown in correspondence with [[Christabel Pankhurst]], a leader of the [[Women's Social and Political Union|WSPU]].

An early attempt to score a debating triumph over the government, made in Balfour's usual abstruse, theoretical style, saw Campbell-Bannerman respond with: \"Enough of this foolery,\" to the delight of his supporters. Balfour made the controversial decision, with [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne|Lord Lansdowne]], to use the heavily Unionist [[House of Lords]] as a check on the political programme and legislation of the Liberal party in the Commons. Legislation was vetoed or altered by amendments between 1906 and 1909, leading [[David Lloyd George]] to remark that the Lords was \"the right hon. Gentleman's poodle. It fetches and carries for him. It barks for him. It bites anybody that he sets it on to. And we are told that this is a great revising Chamber, the safeguard of liberty in the country.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1907/jun/26/house-of-lords#S4V0176P0_19070626_HOC_294|title=HC Deb 26 June 1907 vol 176 cc1408-523|work=Hansard|accessdate=12 May 2019}}</ref> The issue was forced by the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] with Lloyd George's [[People's Budget]], provoking the constitutional crisis that led to the [[Parliament Act 1911]], which limited the Lords to delaying bills for up to two years. After the Unionists lost the general elections of 1910 (despite softening the tariff reform policy with Balfour's promise of a referendum on food taxes), the Unionist peers split to allow the Parliament Act to pass the House of Lords, to prevent mass creation of Liberal peers by the new King, George V. The exhausted Balfour resigned as party leader after the crisis, and was succeeded in late 1911 by [[Bonar Law]].<ref name=\"Zebel1973\"/>\n\nBalfour remained important in the party, however, and when the Unionists joined [[H. H. Asquith|Asquith]]'s coalition government in May 1915, Balfour succeeded Churchill as [[List of the First Lords of the Admiralty|First Lord of the Admiralty]]. When Asquith's government collapsed in December 1916, Balfour, who seemed a potential successor to the premiership, became [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] in Lloyd George's new administration, but not in the small War Cabinet, and was frequently left out of inner workings of government. Balfour's service as Foreign Secretary was notable for the [[Balfour Mission]], a crucial alliance-building visit to the US in April 1917, and the [[Balfour Declaration, 1917|Balfour Declaration]] of 1917, a letter to [[Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild|Lord Rothschild]] affirming the government's support for the establishment of a [[Balfour Declaration, 1917|\"national home for the Jewish people\"]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], then part of the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Jonathan|last= Schneer|title=The Balfour Declaration: the origins of the Arab-Israeli conflict|publisher=Bond Street Books|date= 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Arthur James Balfour.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait by [[Walter Stoneman]], 1921]]\nBalfour resigned as Foreign Secretary following the [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles Conference]] in 1919, but continued in the government (and the Cabinet after normal peacetime political arrangements resumed) as [[Lord President of the Council]]. In 1921\u201322 he represented the British Empire at the [[Washington Naval Conference]] and during summer 1922 stood in for the Foreign Secretary, [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]], who was ill. He put forward a proposal for the international settlement of war debts and reparations (the [[Balfour Note]]), but it was not accepted.<ref name=\"Zebel1973\" />\n\nOn 5 May 1922, Balfour was created [[Earl of Balfour]] and Viscount Traprain, of\n[[Whittingehame]], in the [[county of Haddington]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=32691 |date=5 May 1922 |page=3512 }}</ref> In October 1922 he, with most of the Conservative leadership, resigned with Lloyd George's government following the [[Carlton Club meeting]], a Conservative back-bench revolt against continuance of the coalition. Bonar Law became Prime Minister.  Like many Coalition leaders, he did not hold office in the [[Conservative government, 1922&ndash;1924|Conservative governments of 1922\u20131924]], but as an elder statesman, he was consulted by the King in the choice of [[Stanley Baldwin]] as Bonar Law's successor as Conservative leader in May 1923. When asked whether \"dear George\" (the much more experienced Lord Curzon) would be chosen, he replied, referring to Curzon's wealthy wife Grace, \"No, dear, George will not but while he may have lost the hope of glory he still possesses the means of Grace.\"\n\nBalfour was not initially included in [[Second Baldwin ministry|Baldwin's second government]] in 1924, but in 1925, he returned to the Cabinet, in place of the late Lord Curzon as [[Lord President of the Council]], until the government ended in 1929. With 28 years of government service, Balfour had one of the longest ministerial careers in modern British politics, second only to Winston Churchill .<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22858351 | title=Chasing Churchill: Ken Clarke climbs ministerial long-service chart| work=BBC News| date=2013-06-13| last1=Parkinson| first1=Justin}}</ref>\n\n==Last years==\nBalfour had generally good health until 1928 and remained until then a regular tennis player. Four years previously he had been the first president of the International Lawn Tennis Club of Great Britain. At the end of 1928, most of his teeth were removed and he suffered the unremitting circulatory trouble which ended his life. Before that, he had suffered occasional [[phlebitis]] and, by late 1929, he was immobilised by it.  Balfour died at his brother Gerald's home, Fishers Hill House in Hook Heath, Woking, on 19 March 1930. At his request a public funeral was declined, and he was buried on 22 March beside members of his family at [[Whittingehame]] in a [[Church of Scotland]] service although he also belonged to the [[Church of England]]. By [[special remainder]], his title passed to his brother Gerald.\n\nHis obituaries in ''[[The Times]]'', ''[[The Guardian]]'' and the ''[[Daily Herald (UK newspaper)|Daily Herald]]'' did not mention the declaration for which he is most famous outside Britain.<ref>{{cite book|first=Shabtai |last=Teveth|title=Ben-Gurion and the Palestinian Arabs.

As Chief Secretary for Ireland from 1887 to 1891 he manifested an unflinching commitment to the maintenance of British authority in the face of popular protest.

was a British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] statesman who served as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] from 1902 to 1905. As [[Foreign Secretary]] in the [[Lloyd George ministry]], he issued the [[Balfour Declaration]] in 1917 on behalf of the cabinet.\n\nEntering Parliament in [[1874 United Kingdom general election|1874]], Balfour achieved prominence as [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]], in which position he suppressed agrarian unrest whilst taking measures against absentee landlords. He opposed [[Irish Home Rule movement|Irish Home Rule]], saying there could be no half-way house between Ireland remaining within the United Kingdom or becoming independent. From 1891 he led the Conservative Party in the House of Commons, serving under his uncle, [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], whose government won large majorities in [[1895 United Kingdom general election|1895]] and [[1900 United Kingdom general election|1900]]. An esteemed debater, he was bored by the mundane tasks of party management.\n\nIn July 1902 he succeeded his uncle as Prime Minister. In domestic policy he passed the [[Irish Land Acts|Irish Land Act 1903]], which bought out most of the Anglo-Irish land owners. The [[Education Act 1902]] had a major long-term impact in modernising the school system in England and Wales and provided financial support for schools operated by the Church of England and by the Catholic Church. Nonconformists were outraged and mobilized their voters, but were unable to reverse it. In foreign and defence policy, he oversaw reform of British defence policy and supported [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Jackie Fisher]]'s naval innovations. He secured the [[Entente Cordiale]] with France, an alliance that isolated Germany. He cautiously embraced [[imperial preference]] as championed by [[Joseph Chamberlain]], but resignations from the Cabinet over the abandonment of free trade left his party divided. He also suffered from public anger at the later stages of the [[Boer war]] (counter-insurgency warfare characterized as \"methods of barbarism\") and the importation of Chinese labour to South Africa (\"Chinese slavery\"). He resigned as Prime Minister in December 1905 and the following month the Conservatives suffered a landslide defeat at the [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906 election]], in which he lost his own seat. He soon re-entered Parliament and continued to serve as Leader of the Opposition throughout the crisis over Lloyd George's [[People's Budget|1909 budget]], the narrow loss of two further General Elections in 1910, and the passage of the [[Parliament Act 1911]]. He resigned as party leader in 1911.\n\nBalfour returned as [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] in Asquith's Coalition Government (1915\u201316). In December 1916 he became Foreign Secretary in [[David Lloyd George]]'s coalition. He was frequently left out of the inner workings of foreign policy, although the [[Balfour Declaration]] on a Jewish homeland bore his name. He continued to serve in senior positions throughout the 1920s, and died on 19 March 1930 aged 81, having spent a vast inherited fortune. He never married. Balfour trained as a philosopher \u2013 he originated an argument against believing that human reason could determine truth \u2013 and was seen as having a detached attitude to life, epitomised by a remark attributed to him: \"Nothing matters very much and few things matter at all\".\n\n==Background and early life==\n[[File:Lord Balfour's childhood home.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Whittingehame House]]\nArthur Balfour was born at [[Whittingehame|Whittingehame House]], East Lothian, Scotland, the eldest son of [[James Maitland Balfour]] (1820\u20131856) and [[Lady Blanche Gascoyne-Cecil]] (1825\u20131872). His father was a Scottish MP, as was his grandfather [[James Balfour (died 1845)|James]]; his mother, a member of the [[Marquess of Salisbury|Cecil family]] descended from [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury]], was the daughter of the [[James Gascoyne-Cecil, 2nd Marquess of Salisbury|2nd Marquess of Salisbury]] and a sister to the [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|3rd Marquess]], the future Prime Minister.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=250}} His godfather was the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], after whom he was named.<ref name=Tuch46>{{cite book|author-link=Barbara Tuchman|first=Barbara |last=Tuchman |title=The Proud Tower|title-link=The Proud Tower| p= [https://archive.org/details/proudtowerportr00tuch/page/46 46]|date=1966|publisher=Macmillan}}</ref> He was the eldest son, third of eight children, and had four brothers and three sisters. Arthur Balfour was educated at Grange Preparatory School at [[Hoddesdon]], [[Hertfordshire]] (1859\u20131861), and [[Eton College]] (1861\u20131866), where he studied with the influential master, [[William Johnson Cory]]. He then went up to the [[University of Cambridge]], where he read [[moral sciences]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] (1866\u20131869),<ref>{{acad|id=BLFR866AJ|name=Balfour, Arthur}}</ref> graduating with a [[British undergraduate degree classification|second-class honours]] degree. His younger brother was the Cambridge embryologist [[Francis Maitland Balfour]] (1851\u20131882).<ref>[http://www.burkespeerage.com/records.php www.burkespeerage.com]</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nBalfour met his cousin May Lyttelton in 1870 when she was 19. After her two previous serious suitors had died, Balfour is said to have declared his love for her in December 1874. She died of [[typhus]] on Palm Sunday, March 1875; Balfour arranged for an emerald ring to be buried in her coffin. Lavinia Talbot, May's older sister, believed that an engagement had been imminent, but her recollections of Balfour's distress (he was \"staggered\") were not written down until thirty years later. The historian [[R. J. Q. Adams]] points out that May's letters discuss her love life in detail, but contain no evidence that she was in love with Balfour, nor that he had spoken to her of marriage. He visited her only once during her serious three-month illness, and was soon accepting social invitations again within a month of her death. Adams suggests that, although he may simply have been too shy to express his feelings fully, Balfour may also have encouraged tales of his youthful tragedy as a convenient cover for his disinclination to marry; the matter cannot be conclusively proven.<ref name=\"Adams2007\">{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Ralph James Q. |authorlink=R.

In spring 1878, he became [[Parliamentary Private Secretary|Private Secretary]] to his uncle, [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]. He accompanied Salisbury (then Foreign Secretary) to the [[Congress of Berlin]] and gained his first experience in international politics in connection with the settlement of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|Russo-Turkish conflict]]. At the same time he became known in the world of letters; the academic subtlety and literary achievement of his ''Defence of Philosophic Doubt'' (1879) suggested he might make a reputation as a philosopher.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=250\u2013251}}\n\nBalfour divided his time between politics and academic pursuits. Biographer Sydney Zebel suggested that Belfour continued to appear an amateur or dabbler in public affairs, devoid of ambition and indifferent to policy issues. However, in fact he actually made a dramatic transition to a deeply involved politician. His assets, according to Zebel, included a strong ambition that he kept hidden, shrewd political judgment, a knack for negotiation, a taste for intrigue, and care to avoid factionalism. Most importantly, he deepened his close ties with his uncle Lord Salisbury. He also maintained cordial relationships with Disraeli, Gladstone and other national leaders.<ref name=\"Zebel1973\">{{cite book|first=Sydney Henry |last=Zebel|title=Balfour: A Political Biography|url=https://archive.org/details/balfourpolitical00zebe|url-access=registration |year=1973|publisher=University Press|isbn=978-0-521-08536-6|location=Cambridge}}</ref>{{rp|27}}\n\nReleased from his duties as private secretary by the [[1880 United Kingdom general election|1880 general election]], he began to take more part in parliamentary affairs. He was for a time politically associated with [[Lord Randolph Churchill]], [[Henry Drummond Wolff|Sir Henry Drummond Wolff]] and [[John Eldon Gorst|John Gorst]].

Impressive in matter rather than delivery, his speeches were logical and convincing, and delighted an ever-wider audience.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=251}}\n\nOn the death of [[William Henry Smith (1825\u20131891)|W. H. Smith]] in 1891, Balfour became [[First Lord of the Treasury]] \u2013 the last in British history not to have been concurrently Prime Minister as well \u2013 and [[Leader of the House of Commons]]. After the fall of the government in 1892 he spent three years in opposition. When the Conservatives returned to power, in coalition with the Liberal Unionists, in 1895, Balfour again became Leader of the House and First Lord of the Treasury. His management of the abortive education proposals of 1896 showed a disinclination for the drudgery of parliamentary management, yet he saw the passage of a bill providing Ireland with improved local government under the [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898]] and joined in debates on foreign and domestic questions between 1895 and 1900.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=251}}\n\nDuring the illness of Lord Salisbury in 1898, and again in Salisbury's absence abroad, Balfour was in charge of the [[Foreign Office]], and he conducted negotiations with Russia on the question of railways in North China. As a member of the cabinet responsible for the [[Second Boer War|Transvaal negotiations]] in 1899, he bore his share of controversy and, when the [[Second Boer War|war]] began disastrously, he was first to realise the need to use the country's full military strength. His leadership of the House was marked by firmness in the suppression of obstruction, yet there was a slight revival of the criticisms of 1896.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=251}}\n\n==Prime Minister==\n<!-- linked from redirects [[Premiership of Arthur Balfour]], [[Prime ministership of Arthur Balfour]] -->\n{{Further|Balfour ministry}}<!-- please do not change this link to [[Unionist government, 1895\u20131905]] -->\n[[File:Arthur-James-Balfour-1st-Earl-of-Balfour.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait by [[George Charles Beresford]], 1902]]\nWith Lord Salisbury's resignation on 11 July 1902, Balfour succeeded him as Prime Minister, with the approval of all the Unionist party. The new Prime Minister came into power practically at the same moment as the [[coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra]] and the end of the [[South African War]]. The Liberal party was still disorganised over the Boers.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=252}}\n\nIn foreign affairs, Balfour and his Foreign Secretary, [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne|Lord Lansdowne]], improved relations with France, culminating in the [[Entente Cordiale]] of 1904. The period also saw the [[Russo-Japanese War]], when Britain, an ally of the Japanese, came close to war with Russia after the [[Dogger Bank incident]]. On the whole, Balfour left the conduct of foreign policy to Lansdowne, being busy himself with domestic problems.<ref name=\"Zebel1973\" />\n\nBalfour, who had known Zionist leader [[Chaim Weizmann]] since 1906, opposed Russian mistreatment of Jews and increasingly supported Zionism as a programme for European Jews to settle in Palestine.<ref>{{cite book|first=Milton |last=Viorst|title=Zionism: The Birth and Transformation of an Ideal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=frLPCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA80|year=2016|page=80|isbn=9781466890329}}</ref> However, in 1905 he supported the [[Aliens Act 1905]], one of whose main objectives was to control and restrict Jewish immigration from Eastern Europe.<ref>{{cite book|first=Shlomo|last= Sand|title= The Invention of the Land of Israel: From Holy Land to Homeland|location=London|publisher= Verso|date= 2012|pp= 14\u201315}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Sabbagh | first=Karl | title=Palestine : a personal history | publisher=Atlantic | location=London | year=2006 | isbn=978-1-84354-344-2 | page= 103 | quote = Balfour warned the House of Commons in his speech of 'the undoubted evils that had fallen upon the country from an immigration which was largely Jewish'}}</ref>\n\nThe budget was certain to show a surplus and taxation could be remitted. Yet as events proved, it was the budget that would sow dissension, override other legislative concerns and signal a new political movement. [[Charles Thomson Ritchie]]'s remission of the shilling import-duty on corn led to [[Joseph Chamberlain]]'s crusade in favour of tariff reform. These were taxes on imported goods with [[trade preference]] given to the Empire, to protect British industry from competition, strengthen the Empire in the face of growing German and American economic power, and provide revenue, other than raising taxes, for the social welfare legislation. As the session proceeded, the rift grew in the Unionist ranks.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=252}} Tariff reform was popular with Unionist supporters, but the threat of higher prices for food imports made the policy an electoral albatross. Hoping to split the difference between the free traders and tariff reformers in his cabinet and party, Balfour favoured retaliatory tariffs to punish others who had tariffs against the British, in the hope of encouraging global free trade.\nThis was not sufficient for either the free traders or the extreme tariff reformers in government. With Balfour's agreement, Chamberlain resigned from the Cabinet in late 1903 to campaign for tariff reform. At the same time, Balfour tried to balance the two factions by accepting the resignation of three free-trading ministers, including Chancellor Ritchie, but the almost simultaneous resignation of the free-trader Duke of Devonshire (who as Lord Hartington had been the Liberal Unionist leader of the 1880s) left Balfour's Cabinet weak. By 1905 few Unionist MPs were still free traders (Winston Churchill crossed to the Liberals in 1904 when threatened with deselection at Oldham), but Balfour's act had drained his authority within the government.<ref name=\"Zebel1973\" />\n\nBalfour resigned as Prime Minister in December 1905, hoping the Liberal leader [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman|Campbell-Bannerman]] would be unable to form a strong government. This was dashed when Campbell-Bannerman faced down an attempt (\"[[The Relugas Compact]]\") to \"kick him upstairs\" to the House of Lords. The Conservatives were defeated by the Liberals at the general election the following January (in terms of MPs, a Liberal landslide), with Balfour losing his seat at [[Manchester East (UK Parliament constituency)|Manchester East]] to [[Thomas Gardner Horridge]], a solicitor and [[king's counsel]]. Only 157 Conservatives were returned to the Commons, at least two-thirds followers of Chamberlain, who chaired the Conservative MPs until Balfour won a safe seat in the [[City of London (UK Parliament constituency)|City of London]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=254}}\n\n===Achievements and mistakes===\nAccording to historian [[Robert Ensor]], writing in 1936, Balfour can be credited with achievement in five major areas:<ref name=\"Ensor1936\">{{cite book|first=R.

Ensor said the Act ranked:\n{{quote|among the two or three greatest constructive measures of the twentieth century....[He did not write it] but no statesman less dominated than Balfour was by the concept of national efficiency would have taken it up and carried it through, since its cost on the side of votes was obvious and deterrent....Public money was thus made available for the first time to ensure properly paid teachers and a standardized level of efficiency for all children alike [including the Anglican and Catholic schools].<ref name=\"Ensor1936\" />{{rp|355\u201356}}\n}}\n\nFor most of the 19th century, the very powerful political and economic position of the [[Church of Ireland]] (Anglican) landowners blocked the political aspirations of Irish nationalists, who by 1900 included both Catholic and Presbyterian elements. Balfour's solution was to buy them out, not by compulsion, but by offering the owners a full immediate payment and a 12% bonus on the sales price.  The British government purchased 13 million acres (53,000 km2) by 1920,  and sold farms to the tenants at low payments spread over seven decades. It would cost money, but all sides proved amenable.<ref name=\"Ensor1936\" />{{rp|358\u201360}}  Starting in 1923 the Irish government bought out most of the remaining landowners, and in 1933 diverted payments being made to the British treasury and used them for local improvements.<ref name=\"Lee1989\">{{cite book|first=J.

Chamberlain proposed to turn the Empire into a closed [[trade bloc]] protected by high tariffs against imports from Germany and the United States. He argued that tariff reform would revive a flagging British economy, strengthen imperial ties with the dominions and the colonies, and produce a positive programme that would facilitate reelection. He was vehemently opposed by Conservative free traders who denounced the proposal as economically fallacious, and open to the charge of raising food prices in Britain. Balfour tried to forestall disruption by removing key ministers on each side, and offering a much narrower tariff programme. It was ingenious, but both sides rejected any compromise, and his party's chances for reelection were ruined.<ref name=\"Goodlad2010\" /><ref name=\"PearceGoodlad2013\">{{cite book|first1=Robert|last1= Pearce |first2=Graham|last2= Goodlad|title=British Prime Ministers From Balfour to Brown|date=2013}}</ref>{{rp|4\u20136}}\n\nBalfour may have been personally sympathetic to extending suffrage, with his brother Gerald, Conservative MP for Leeds Central married to women's suffrage activist [[Lady Constance Bulwer-Lytton|Constance Lytton]]'s sister Betty.<ref name=\":0\" /> But he accepted the strength of the political opposition to women's suffrage, as shown in correspondence with [[Christabel Pankhurst]], a leader of the [[Women's Social and Political Union|WSPU]].

An early attempt to score a debating triumph over the government, made in Balfour's usual abstruse, theoretical style, saw Campbell-Bannerman respond with: \"Enough of this foolery,\" to the delight of his supporters.

Legislation was vetoed or altered by amendments between 1906 and 1909, leading [[David Lloyd George]] to remark that the Lords was \"the right hon. Gentleman's poodle. It fetches and carries for him.

After the Unionists lost the general elections of 1910 (despite softening the tariff reform policy with Balfour's promise of a referendum on food taxes), the Unionist peers split to allow the Parliament Act to pass the House of Lords, to prevent mass creation of Liberal peers by the new King, George V. The exhausted Balfour resigned as party leader after the crisis, and was succeeded in late 1911 by [[Bonar Law]].<ref name=\"Zebel1973\"/>\n\nBalfour remained important in the party, however, and when the Unionists joined [[H.

The Tequesta Indians fished, hunted, and gathered the fruit and roots of plants for food, but did not practice any form of agriculture. They buried the small bones of the deceased with the rest of the body, and put the larger bones in a box for the village people to see. The Tequesta are credited with making the [[Miami Circle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historymiami.org/visit/miami-circle/|title=Miami Circle to Brickell Avenue \u2013 From Native to NOW! \u2013 HistoryMiami Museum|website=www.historymiami.org}}</ref>\n\n===Founding of Broward===\nAlthough the area has been settled since about 1400 B.C., Broward County was founded on April 30, 1915.<ref name=\"Greater Fort Lauderdale\">{{cite web | title=broward county history | website=Greater Fort Lauderdale | url=http://www.sunny.org/history/ | accessdate=2015-10-02}}</ref> It was intended to be named Everglades County, but then-[[Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives]] [[Ion Farris]] amended the bill that established the county to name it in honor of [[Napoleon Bonaparte Broward]], governor of Florida from 1905 to 1909.<ref>{{cite news|last=Reese|first=J.

This opened up much of today's urban Broward County for development, first as agricultural land and later as residential. A year before Broward became governor, Dania became the first incorporated community of what is now Broward County, followed by Pompano in 1908, and Fort Lauderdale in 1911.\n\nIn 1915, [[Palm Beach County]] and [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Dade County]] contributed nearly equal portions of land to create Broward County.<ref name=\"Greater Fort Lauderdale\" /> Dixie Highway was also completed through Broward County in 1915. In 1916, the settlement of \"Zona\" was renamed [[Davie, Florida|Davie]] in recognition of Robert P. Davie, a land developer who purchased a great deal of reclaimed Everglades land.\n\nBroward County began a huge development boom after its incorporation, with the first \"tourist hotel\", in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]], opening in 1919. A year later, developers began dredging wetlands in the county to create island communities.<ref name=\"Greater Fort Lauderdale\" />\n\n===Land boom and rapid growth===\n1925 was considered the peak of the Florida land boom with Davie, [[Deerfield, Florida|Deerfield]], [[Oakland Park, Florida|Floranada]], and [[Hollywood, Florida|Hollywood]] all being incorporated. By 1925, the boom was considered to have reached its peak, but the [[1926 Miami hurricane]] caused economic depression in the county.<ref name=\"Greater Fort Lauderdale\" />  In 1926, the [[Hollywood Seminole Indian Reservation]] (formerly \"Dania Reservation\") was opened. In 1927, [[Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, Florida|Lauderdale-by-the-Sea]] was incorporated. In 1928, the Bay Mabel Harbor (now the [[Port Everglades]] channel) was opened. In 1929, Merle Fogg Airport (now site of [[Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport]]) was dedicated. In 1939, [[Hillsboro Beach, Florida|Hillsboro Beach]] was incorporated. [[Gulfstream Park]] also opened in [[Hallandale Beach, Florida|Hallandale]] in 1939.\n\nThe county saw another population and development boom [[Post\u2013World War II baby boom|post]]-[[World War II]] when the transformation from agricultural to urbanized residential area began. In 1947, Pompano merged with beach area to form the present day [[Pompano Beach, Florida|City of Pompano Beach]].\n\nThere was another boom between the 1950s and the late 1960s. In 1953, [[Plantation, Florida|Plantation]], [[Lazy Lake, Florida|Lazy Lake]], and [[Fern Crest Village, Florida|Fern Crest Village]] were incorporated. In 1955, [[Margate, Florida|Margate]] and [[Miramar, Florida|Miramar]] were incorporated. In 1956, [[Lighthouse Point, Florida|Lighthouse Point]] was incorporated and the [[Florida Turnpike]] was completed through Broward County. In 1957, [[Pembroke Park, Florida|Pembroke Park]] was incorporated. In 1959, [[Cooper City, Florida|Cooper City]], [[Lauderhill, Florida|Lauderhill]], and [[Sea Ranch Lakes, Florida|Sea Ranch Lakes]] were incorporated.\n\nIn 1946 Dr. [[Von D. Mizell]] and black business owners petitioned the County Commission to make a county beach available to African Americans; at the time the beaches in Broward County, as elsewhere in Florida, were for whites only. Eight years later a beach, today [[Dr. Von D. Mizell-Eula Johnson State Park]], in [[Dania Beach]], was made available, but there was no road to it until 1965. In the meantime, Mizell and [[Eula Johnson]], with supporters, deliberately violated the law on July 4, 1961, by wading into the water on Ft. Lauderdale beach. The legal process set in motion by this incident resulted in the desegregation of Broward County beaches in 1962.<ref>{{cite news\n|title=Wade in the Water\n|first=Robert\n|last=Beatty\n|date=April 10, 2008\n|newspaper=[[South Florida Times]]\n|url=http://www.sfltimes.com/uncategorized/wade-in-the-water\n|access-date=August 26, 2019\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190826110044/http://www.sfltimes.com/uncategorized/wade-in-the-water\n|archive-date=August 26, 2019\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1960, the [[Pembroke Pines, Florida|City of Pembroke Pines]] was incorporated.

The Board of County Commissioners is the legislative branch of Broward County Government. The County Commission is composed of nine members elected by district. Each Commissioner must be a resident of the district for which he or she seeks election. Each year the Commission elects a [[mayor]] and [[vice mayor]]. The mayor's functions include serving as presiding officer, and as the county's official representative. The Commission appoints the County Administrator, County Attorney and County Auditor. The Commission also appoints numerous advisory and regulatory boards.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.broward.org/Charter/Documents/BC-Charter.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2020-02-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200204211042/https://www.broward.org/Charter/Documents/BC-Charter.pdf |archive-date=2020-02-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe County Commission meets in formal session the first four Tuesdays of each month at 10:00&nbsp;a.m. in Room 422 of the Broward County Governmental Center.

It voted twice for [[Ronald Reagan]] (1980, 1984) and once for [[George H. W. Bush]] (1988). From 1916 to 1972 it voted Democratic six times and Republican in nine elections. In 2008 and 2012 approximately 67.07% of the electorate voted for Democrat [[Barack Obama]]. In 2016, Democrat [[Hillary Clinton]] won 66.08% of the vote.\n\n====Election history====\nFrom 1948 to 1988, the county went Republican in every election except for [[U.S. presidential election, 1976|1976]]. In the [[U.S. presidential election, 1964|1964 presidential election]], the county supported [[Barry Goldwater]] by a 56-44 margin even as he lost in a landslide nationwide, and in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1972|1972 presidential election]], Broward County voters strongly backed [[Richard Nixon]] over [[George McGovern]]. But since 1992, Broward County has supported the Democratic [[presidential nominee]] by increasing majorities.

The Tequesta Indians fished, hunted, and gathered the fruit and roots of plants for food, but did not practice any form of agriculture. They buried the small bones of the deceased with the rest of the body, and put the larger bones in a box for the village people to see. The Tequesta are credited with making the [[Miami Circle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historymiami.org/visit/miami-circle/|title=Miami Circle to Brickell Avenue \u2013 From Native to NOW! \u2013 HistoryMiami Museum|website=www.historymiami.org}}</ref>\n\n===Founding of Broward===\nAlthough the area has been settled since about 1400 B.C., Broward County was founded on April 30, 1915.<ref name=\"Greater Fort Lauderdale\">{{cite web | title=broward county history | website=Greater Fort Lauderdale | url=http://www.sunny.org/history/ | accessdate=2015-10-02}}</ref> It was intended to be named Everglades County, but then-[[Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives]] [[Ion Farris]] amended the bill that established the county to name it in honor of [[Napoleon Bonaparte Broward]], governor of Florida from 1905 to 1909.<ref>{{cite news|last=Reese|first=J.

This opened up much of today's urban Broward County for development, first as agricultural land and later as residential. A year before Broward became governor, Dania became the first incorporated community of what is now Broward County, followed by Pompano in 1908, and Fort Lauderdale in 1911.\n\nIn 1915, [[Palm Beach County]] and [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Dade County]] contributed nearly equal portions of land to create Broward County.<ref name=\"Greater Fort Lauderdale\" /> Dixie Highway was also completed through Broward County in 1915. In 1916, the settlement of \"Zona\" was renamed [[Davie, Florida|Davie]] in recognition of Robert P. Davie, a land developer who purchased a great deal of reclaimed Everglades land.\n\nBroward County began a huge development boom after its incorporation, with the first \"tourist hotel\", in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]], opening in 1919. A year later, developers began dredging wetlands in the county to create island communities.<ref name=\"Greater Fort Lauderdale\" />\n\n===Land boom and rapid growth===\n1925 was considered the peak of the Florida land boom with Davie, [[Deerfield, Florida|Deerfield]], [[Oakland Park, Florida|Floranada]], and [[Hollywood, Florida|Hollywood]] all being incorporated. By 1925, the boom was considered to have reached its peak, but the [[1926 Miami hurricane]] caused economic depression in the county.<ref name=\"Greater Fort Lauderdale\" />  In 1926, the [[Hollywood Seminole Indian Reservation]] (formerly \"Dania Reservation\") was opened. In 1927, [[Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, Florida|Lauderdale-by-the-Sea]] was incorporated. In 1928, the Bay Mabel Harbor (now the [[Port Everglades]] channel) was opened. In 1929, Merle Fogg Airport (now site of [[Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport]]) was dedicated. In 1939, [[Hillsboro Beach, Florida|Hillsboro Beach]] was incorporated. [[Gulfstream Park]] also opened in [[Hallandale Beach, Florida|Hallandale]] in 1939.\n\nThe county saw another population and development boom [[Post\u2013World War II baby boom|post]]-[[World War II]] when the transformation from agricultural to urbanized residential area began. In 1947, Pompano merged with beach area to form the present day [[Pompano Beach, Florida|City of Pompano Beach]].\n\nThere was another boom between the 1950s and the late 1960s. In 1953, [[Plantation, Florida|Plantation]], [[Lazy Lake, Florida|Lazy Lake]], and [[Fern Crest Village, Florida|Fern Crest Village]] were incorporated. In 1955, [[Margate, Florida|Margate]] and [[Miramar, Florida|Miramar]] were incorporated. In 1956, [[Lighthouse Point, Florida|Lighthouse Point]] was incorporated and the [[Florida Turnpike]] was completed through Broward County. In 1957, [[Pembroke Park, Florida|Pembroke Park]] was incorporated. In 1959, [[Cooper City, Florida|Cooper City]], [[Lauderhill, Florida|Lauderhill]], and [[Sea Ranch Lakes, Florida|Sea Ranch Lakes]] were incorporated.\n\nIn 1946 Dr. [[Von D. Mizell]] and black business owners petitioned the County Commission to make a county beach available to African Americans; at the time the beaches in Broward County, as elsewhere in Florida, were for whites only. Eight years later a beach, today [[Dr. Von D. Mizell-Eula Johnson State Park]], in [[Dania Beach]], was made available, but there was no road to it until 1965. In the meantime, Mizell and [[Eula Johnson]], with supporters, deliberately violated the law on July 4, 1961, by wading into the water on Ft. Lauderdale beach. The legal process set in motion by this incident resulted in the desegregation of Broward County beaches in 1962.<ref>{{cite news\n|title=Wade in the Water\n|first=Robert\n|last=Beatty\n|date=April 10, 2008\n|newspaper=[[South Florida Times]]\n|url=http://www.sfltimes.com/uncategorized/wade-in-the-water\n|access-date=August 26, 2019\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190826110044/http://www.sfltimes.com/uncategorized/wade-in-the-water\n|archive-date=August 26, 2019\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1960, the [[Pembroke Pines, Florida|City of Pembroke Pines]] was incorporated.

The Board of County Commissioners is the legislative branch of Broward County Government. The County Commission is composed of nine members elected by district. Each Commissioner must be a resident of the district for which he or she seeks election. Each year the Commission elects a [[mayor]] and [[vice mayor]]. The mayor's functions include serving as presiding officer, and as the county's official representative. The Commission appoints the County Administrator, County Attorney and County Auditor. The Commission also appoints numerous advisory and regulatory boards.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.broward.org/Charter/Documents/BC-Charter.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2020-02-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200204211042/https://www.broward.org/Charter/Documents/BC-Charter.pdf |archive-date=2020-02-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe County Commission meets in formal session the first four Tuesdays of each month at 10:00&nbsp;a.m. in Room 422 of the Broward County Governmental Center.

It voted twice for [[Ronald Reagan]] (1980, 1984) and once for [[George H. W. Bush]] (1988). From 1916 to 1972 it voted Democratic six times and Republican in nine elections. In 2008 and 2012 approximately 67.07% of the electorate voted for Democrat [[Barack Obama]]. In 2016, Democrat [[Hillary Clinton]] won 66.08% of the vote.\n\n====Election history====\nFrom 1948 to 1988, the county went Republican in every election except for [[U.S. presidential election, 1976|1976]]. In the [[U.S. presidential election, 1964|1964 presidential election]], the county supported [[Barry Goldwater]] by a 56-44 margin even as he lost in a landslide nationwide, and in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1972|1972 presidential election]], Broward County voters strongly backed [[Richard Nixon]] over [[George McGovern]]. But since 1992, Broward County has supported the Democratic [[presidential nominee]] by increasing majorities. It is now the most reliably Democratic county in the state,<ref name=\"Broward Power\">[http://www.sptimes.com/2002/04/28/news_pf/State/Broward_Power.shtml State:Broward Power].

The lore states a woman was unloved  by her husband and her husband loved their two sons instead of her. She caught her husband with another woman and drowned her sons in a river. Out of grief and anger she then drowned herself. She was refused entry to heaven until she found the souls of her two sons. She cries and wails and takes children and drowns them in the river she and her sons drowned in. The legend represents La Llorona as a person or ghost. She went to hell and came back alive from coming up the same river she and her sons died in. She hunts for her ex-husband as well as children.\n\nAngel she knew one of your ancestors\nThe legend described in this article is the Mexican version of this folktale. Other regional variations of the story exist.\n\nAccording to the legend, in a rural village in [[Mexico]], there lived a beautiful young woman named Mar\u00eda. She came from a poor family but was known around her village for her beauty and grace. One day, an extremely wealthy nobleman was riding through her village and stopped in his tracks. He had traveled all over the world and has never seen anyone as beautiful as Mar\u00eda. He was mesmerized by her. He knew that he had to win her heart. '''Mar\u00eda was easily charmed by him and he was charmed by her beauty, so when he proposed to her, she immediately accepted. Eventually, the two [[married]], and Mar\u00eda gave birth to two sons. Her husband was always traveling and he stopped spending time with his family.''' When he came home, he only paid attention to the children and as time passed Mar\u00eda could tell that her husband was falling out of love with her because she was getting old. One day he returned to the village with a younger woman, and bid his children farewell, ignoring Mar\u00eda.<ref name=\"literacynet1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.literacynet.org/lp/hperspectives/llorona.html|title=LA LLORONA - A HISPANIC LEGEND|website=www.literacynet.org|access-date=2016-12-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119025116/http://www.literacynet.org/lp/hperspectives/llorona.html|archive-date=2016-11-19|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nMar\u00eda, angry and hurt, took her children to a river and drowned them in a blind rage. She realized what she had done and searched for them, but the river had already carried them away. Days later, her husband came back and asked about the children, but Maria started weeping and said that she had drowned them. Her husband was furious and said that she could not be with him unless she found their children.\n\nNow she spends eternity looking for her lost children.

In one folk story of {{lang|es|La Malinche}}, she became Cort\u00e9s's mistress and bore him a child, only to be abandoned so that he could marry a Spanish lady (although no evidence exists that {{lang|es|La Malinche}} killed her children). Aztec pride drove {{lang|es|La Malinche}} to acts of vengeance. In this context, the tale compares the Spanish discovery of the [[New World]] and the demise of indigenous culture after the conquest with {{lang|es|La Llorona}}'s loss. Before the Spaniards arrival to Tenochtitlan, there were seven ugly omens, the sixth of those was a woman screaming during the nights crying : \"Where will I take you?,oh my children! [Miguel Le\u00f3n Portilla- Visi\u00f3n de los Vencidos, p. 21].\n\nStories of weeping female phantoms are common in the folklore of both [[Europe]]an and [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous American]] cultures. Scholars have pointed out similarities between {{lang|es|La Llorona}} and the {{lang|nah|[[Cihuac\u014d\u0101tl]]}} of [[Aztec mythology]],{{sfn|Werner|1997|p=753}} as well as [[Eve]] and [[Lilith]] of [[Old World]] mythology.{{sfn|Norget|2006|p=146}} Author [[Ben Radford]]'s investigation into the legend of {{lang|es|La Llorona}}, published in ''[[Mysterious New Mexico]]'', traced elements of the story back to a German folktale dating from 1486.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Radford|first1=Ben|title=Mysterious New Mexico|date=2014|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|location=Albuquerque|isbn=978-0-8263-5450-1|page=228|quote=While the classic image of {{lang|es|La Llorona}} was likely taken from an Aztec goddess named {{lang|nah|Cihuac\u014d\u0101tl}}, the narrative of her legend has other origins. As Bacil Kirtley (1960) wrote in Western Folklore, \"During the same decade that {{lang|es|La Llorona}} was first mentioned in Mexico, a story, seemingly already quite old, of '{{lang|de|Die Weisse Frau}}' ('The White Lady')\u2014which reproduces many of the features consistently recurring in the more developed versions of '{{lang|es|La Llorona}}', was recorded in Germany\"; references to {{lang|de|Die Weisse Frau}} date back as early as 1486. The story of the White Lady follows a virtually identical plot to the classical {{lang|es|La Llorona}} story.}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest published reference to {{lang|es|La Llorona}} occurred in a sonnet written by Mexican poet [[Manuel Carpio]] in the late 1800s. The poem makes no reference to infanticide, rather {{lang|es|La Llorona}} is identified as the ghost of a woman who was murdered by her husband.{{sfn|Werner|1997|p=753}}\n\n===Similar folktales===\nThe [[Chumash people|Chumash]] of Southern California have their own connection to {{lang|es|La Llorona}}.

[[Sarah Shahi]] portrayed Constance Welch, The Woman in White who, after discovering her husband's infidelity took the lives of her two children by drowning them in a bathtub at home and soon after, took her own by jumping off a bridge into a river. Her ghost was known to haunt the Centennial Highway, hitchhiking unknowing motorists, mostly men, and killing those whom she deemed unfaithful. Main character [[Sam Winchester]] destroyed her ghost by crashing his car into the house where she used to live. Finally facing the ghosts of her children, The Woman in White was destroyed by her own guilt from killing them.\n\nLa Llorona appears as the main antagonist of the Mexican animated film ''[[La Leyenda de la Llorona]]''. Here, La Llorona is portrayed as a more sympathetic character, with her children's deaths coming as an accident rather than at her own hands.\n\nIn 1995, Mexican playwright [[Josefina L\u00f3pez]] wrote \"Unconquered Spirits\", which uses the myth of La Llorona as a plot device. The play has two time periods, with Act One taking place in 16th Century Mexico after Spain occupied it. Here, Lopez takes inspiration from the \"La Malinche\" variation, with the heroine represented as a young Aztec girl who is brutally raped by a Spanish Friar. She gives birth to twin boys as a result, and drowns them in the river out of protection rather than spite. Act Two takes place in 1938 amidst the San Antonio Pecan Sheller's Strike. A widowed mother who works at the Pecan factory has an abortion after being raped by her white supervisor, resulting in a visit from La Llorona to give her the strength to fight back against her attacker.

The lore states a woman was unloved  by her husband and her husband loved their two sons instead of her. She caught her husband with another woman and drowned her sons in a river. Out of grief and anger she then drowned herself. She was refused entry to heaven until she found the souls of her two sons. She cries and wails and takes children and drowns them in the river she and her sons drowned in. The legend represents La Llorona as a person or ghost. She went to hell and came back alive from coming up the same river she and her sons died in. She hunts for her ex-husband as well as children.\n\nAngel she knew one of your ancestors\nThe legend described in this article is the Mexican version of this folktale. Other regional variations of the story exist.\n\nAccording to the legend, in a rural village in [[Mexico]], there lived a beautiful young woman named Mar\u00eda. She came from a poor family but was known around her village for her beauty and grace. One day, an extremely wealthy nobleman was riding through her village and stopped in his tracks. He had traveled all over the world and has never seen anyone as beautiful as Mar\u00eda. He was mesmerized by her. He knew that he had to win her heart. '''Mar\u00eda was easily charmed by him and he was charmed by her beauty, so when he proposed to her, she immediately accepted. Eventually, the two [[married]], and Mar\u00eda gave birth to two sons. Her husband was always traveling and he stopped spending time with his family.''' When he came home, he only paid attention to the children and as time passed Mar\u00eda could tell that her husband was falling out of love with her because she was getting old. One day he returned to the village with a younger woman, and bid his children farewell, ignoring Mar\u00eda.<ref name=\"literacynet1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.literacynet.org/lp/hperspectives/llorona.html|title=LA LLORONA - A HISPANIC LEGEND|website=www.literacynet.org|access-date=2016-12-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119025116/http://www.literacynet.org/lp/hperspectives/llorona.html|archive-date=2016-11-19|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nMar\u00eda, angry and hurt, took her children to a river and drowned them in a blind rage. She realized what she had done and searched for them, but the river had already carried them away. Days later, her husband came back and asked about the children, but Maria started weeping and said that she had drowned them. Her husband was furious and said that she could not be with him unless she found their children.\n\nNow she spends eternity looking for her lost children.

Aztec pride drove {{lang|es|La Malinche}} to acts of vengeance. In this context, the tale compares the Spanish discovery of the [[New World]] and the demise of indigenous culture after the conquest with {{lang|es|La Llorona}}'s loss. Before the Spaniards arrival to Tenochtitlan, there were seven ugly omens, the sixth of those was a woman screaming during the nights crying : \"Where will I take you?,oh my children!

As Bacil Kirtley (1960) wrote in Western Folklore, \"During the same decade that {{lang|es|La Llorona}} was first mentioned in Mexico, a story, seemingly already quite old, of '{{lang|de|Die Weisse Frau}}' ('The White Lady')\u2014which reproduces many of the features consistently recurring in the more developed versions of '{{lang|es|La Llorona}}', was recorded in Germany\"; references to {{lang|de|Die Weisse Frau}} date back as early as 1486.

[[Sarah Shahi]] portrayed Constance Welch, The Woman in White who, after discovering her husband's infidelity took the lives of her two children by drowning them in a bathtub at home and soon after, took her own by jumping off a bridge into a river. Her ghost was known to haunt the Centennial Highway, hitchhiking unknowing motorists, mostly men, and killing those whom she deemed unfaithful. Main character [[Sam Winchester]] destroyed her ghost by crashing his car into the house where she used to live. Finally facing the ghosts of her children, The Woman in White was destroyed by her own guilt from killing them.\n\nLa Llorona appears as the main antagonist of the Mexican animated film ''[[La Leyenda de la Llorona]]''. Here, La Llorona is portrayed as a more sympathetic character, with her children's deaths coming as an accident rather than at her own hands.\n\nIn 1995, Mexican playwright [[Josefina L\u00f3pez]] wrote \"Unconquered Spirits\", which uses the myth of La Llorona as a plot device. The play has two time periods, with Act One taking place in 16th Century Mexico after Spain occupied it. Here, Lopez takes inspiration from the \"La Malinche\" variation, with the heroine represented as a young Aztec girl who is brutally raped by a Spanish Friar. She gives birth to twin boys as a result, and drowns them in the river out of protection rather than spite. Act Two takes place in 1938 amidst the San Antonio Pecan Sheller's Strike. A widowed mother who works at the Pecan factory has an abortion after being raped by her white supervisor, resulting in a visit from La Llorona to give her the strength to fight back against her attacker. The play is well noted for its sympathetic portrayal of La Llorona as a victim of oppression.\n\nIn [[Nancy Farmer]]'s 2002 science fiction novel, ''[[The House of the Scorpion]]'', and its 2013 sequel book, ''[[The Lord of Opium]]'', the main character, Matt, makes several references to La Llorona, often when retelling the story to other main characters or during self-reflection.\n\nThe 2006 Mexican horror film ''[[Kilometer 31]]'' is inspired by the legend of La Llorona, and the main evil entity in the film is based on her and her story.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\nLa Llorona has also been the theme character of several of [[Universal Studios]]'s haunted houses during their annual Halloween event, [[Halloween Horror Nights]] (Both Hollywood and Orlando locations).<ref>{{cite web|title=La Llorona comes to \"Halloween Horror Nights\"|url=http://www.latimes.com/visuals/video/65277378-132.html|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=12 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2019, [[James Wan]], [[Gary Dauberman]] and Emilie Gladstone produced a film titled ''[[The Curse of La Llorona]]''.

The OPV is less expensive and easier to administer, and can spread immunity beyond the person vaccinated, creating [[contact immunity]]. It has been the predominant vaccine used.

The oral vaccine is a powerful tool in fighting polio in part because of its person-to-person transmission and resulting contact immunity.  However, under conditions of long-term circulation in under-vaccinated populations, the virus can accumulate mutations that reverse the attenuation and result in vaccine virus strains that themselves cause polio.  As a result of such circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) strains, polio outbreaks have periodically recurred in regions that have long been free of the wild virus, but where vaccination rates have fallen.  Oral vaccines can also give rise to persistent infection in immunodeficient individuals, with the virus eventually mutating into a more virulent immunodeficiency-associated vaccine-derived poliovirus (iVDPV).  In particular the type{{nbsp}}2 strain seems prone to reversions, so in 2016 the eradication effort abandoned the trivalent oral vaccine containing attenuated strains of all three virus types, and replaced it with a bivalent oral vaccine lacking the type{{nbsp}}2 virus.  Eradication efforts will eventually require all oral vaccination to be discontinued in favor of the use of injectable vaccines.  These vaccines are more expensive and harder to deliver, and they lack the ability to induce contact immunity because they contain only killed virus, but they likewise are incapable of giving rise to vaccine-derived viral strains.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vaccine-Derived Poliovirus|publisher=[[Global Polio Eradication Initiative]] (GPEI)|access-date=26 June 2018|url=http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-prevention/the-virus/vaccine-derived-polio-viruses/}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Duintjer Tebbens | first1=Duintjer Tebbens RJ, Thompson KM |title=Managing the risk of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus during the endgame: oral poliovirus vaccine needs|journal=BMC Infectious Diseases|volume=15|page=390|date=September 2015|doi=10.1186/s12879-015-1114-6| pmid=26404780 | pmc=4582727 }}</ref>\n\n=== Surveillance ===\nA global program of surveillance for the presence of polio and the poliovirus plays a critical role in assessment of eradication and in outbreak detection and response.

In 2018, the GPEI conducted environmental surveillance in 44 countries, 24 of which are in Africa.<ref name=\"surv\" />\n\n=== Obstacles ===\n\nAmong the greatest obstacles to global polio eradication are the lack of basic health infrastructure, which limits vaccine distribution and delivery, the crippling effects of civil war and internal strife, and the sometimes oppositional stance that marginalized communities take against what is perceived as a potentially hostile intervention by outsiders. Another challenge has been maintaining the [[Potency (pharmacology)|potency]] of live (attenuated) vaccines in extremely hot or remote areas. The oral polio vaccine must be kept at {{convert|2|to|8|C|F}} for vaccination to be successful.<ref name= Watch/>\n\nAn independent evaluation of obstacles to polio eradication requested by the WHO and conducted in 2009 considered the major obstacles in detail by country. In Afghanistan and Pakistan, they concluded that the most significant barrier was insecurity; but that managing human resources, political pressures, the movement of large populations between and within both countries, inadequately resourced health facilities, also posed problems, as well as technical issues with the vaccine. In [[India]], the major challenge appeared to be the high efficiency of transmission within the populations of [[Bihar]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]] states, set against the low (~80% after three doses against type{{nbsp}}1) [[seroconversion]] response seen from the vaccine. In Nigeria, meanwhile, the most critical barriers identified were management issues, in particular the highly variable importance ascribed to polio by different authorities at the local government level, although funding issues, community perceptions of vaccine safety, inadequate mobilisation of community groups, and issues with the cold chain also played a role. Finally, in those countries where international spread from endemic countries had resulted in transmission becoming re-established\u2014namely [[Angola]], [[Chad]], and [[South Sudan]], the key issues identified were underdeveloped health systems and low routine vaccine coverage, although low resources committed to Angola and South Sudan for the purpose of curtailing the spread of polio and climatic factors were also identified as playing a role.<ref name=evaluation>{{cite web|title=Polio Eradication Evaluation |url=http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/Polio_Evaluation_Report.asp |accessdate=19 February 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706172238/http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/Polio_Evaluation_Report.asp |archivedate=6 July 2010 }}</ref>\n\nTwo additional challenges are found in unobserved polio transmission and in vaccine-derived poliovirus.

Refusal of vaccination came to be viewed as resistance to western expansionism, and when the contamination rumours led the Nigerian Supreme Council for Sharia to call for a region-wide boycott of polio vaccination, polio cases in the country increased more than five-fold between 2002 and 2006, with the uncontrolled virus then spreading across Africa and globally.<ref name=Ghani>{{cite journal |last1=Ghani |first1=Isaac |last2=Willott |first2=Chris |last3=Dadari |first3=Ibrahim |last4=Larson |first4=Heidi J. |title=Listening to the rumours: What the northern Nigeria polio vaccine boycott can tell us ten years on |journal=Global Public Health |volume=8 |issue=10 |pages=1138\u20131150 |year=2013 |doi=10.1080/17441692.2013.859720|pmid=24294986 |pmc=4098042 }}</ref><ref name=Njeru >{{cite journal|title=Did the call for boycott by the Catholic bishops affect the polio vaccination coverage in Kenya in 2015?

The OPV is less expensive and easier to administer, and can spread immunity beyond the person vaccinated, creating [[contact immunity]]. It has been the predominant vaccine used. However, under conditions of long-term vaccine virus circulation in under-vaccinated populations, mutations can reactivate the virus to produce a polio-inducing strain, while the OPV can also, in rare circumstances, induce polio or persistent asymptomatic infection in vaccinated individuals, particularly those who are immunodeficient. Being inactivated, the IPV is free of these risks but does not induce contact immunity. IPV is more costly and the logistics of delivery are more challenging.\n\n<!-- Progress thus far. -->\nThe 175 diagnosed wild polio virus (WPV) cases worldwide in 2019{{Update after|2021|03}} represented the highest number of cases since 2014, but still a {{Percentage|{{#expr:719-175}}|719}} reduction from the 719 diagnosed cases in 2000 and a {{Percentage|{{#expr:350000-175}}|350000|2}} reduction from the estimated 350,000 cases when the eradication effort began in 1988.

The oral vaccine is a powerful tool in fighting polio in part because of its person-to-person transmission and resulting contact immunity.  However, under conditions of long-term circulation in under-vaccinated populations, the virus can accumulate mutations that reverse the attenuation and result in vaccine virus strains that themselves cause polio.  As a result of such circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) strains, polio outbreaks have periodically recurred in regions that have long been free of the wild virus, but where vaccination rates have fallen.  Oral vaccines can also give rise to persistent infection in immunodeficient individuals, with the virus eventually mutating into a more virulent immunodeficiency-associated vaccine-derived poliovirus (iVDPV).  In particular the type{{nbsp}}2 strain seems prone to reversions, so in 2016 the eradication effort abandoned the trivalent oral vaccine containing attenuated strains of all three virus types, and replaced it with a bivalent oral vaccine lacking the type{{nbsp}}2 virus.  Eradication efforts will eventually require all oral vaccination to be discontinued in favor of the use of injectable vaccines.  These vaccines are more expensive and harder to deliver, and they lack the ability to induce contact immunity because they contain only killed virus, but they likewise are incapable of giving rise to vaccine-derived viral strains.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vaccine-Derived Poliovirus|publisher=[[Global Polio Eradication Initiative]] (GPEI)|access-date=26 June 2018|url=http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-prevention/the-virus/vaccine-derived-polio-viruses/}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Duintjer Tebbens | first1=Duintjer Tebbens RJ, Thompson KM |title=Managing the risk of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus during the endgame: oral poliovirus vaccine needs|journal=BMC Infectious Diseases|volume=15|page=390|date=September 2015|doi=10.1186/s12879-015-1114-6| pmid=26404780 | pmc=4582727 }}</ref>\n\n=== Surveillance ===\nA global program of surveillance for the presence of polio and the poliovirus plays a critical role in assessment of eradication and in outbreak detection and response.  Two distinct methods are used in tandem: Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) surveillance and environmental surveillance.<ref name=\"surv\" />\n\nMonitoring for AFP aims at identifying outbreaks of polio by screening patients displaying symptoms consistent with but not exclusive to severe poliovirus infection. Stool samples are collected from children presenting with AFP and evaluated for the presence of poliovirus by accredited laboratories in the Global Polio Laboratory Network. Since rates of non-polio AFP are expected to be constant and large compared to polio cases, the frequency of non-polio AFP reported in a population is indicative of the effectiveness of surveillance, as is the proportion of AFP patients from whom high-quality stool samples are collected and tested, with a target of at least 80%.<ref name=\"surv\">{{cite journal|\nvauthors=Patel JC, Diop OM, Gardner T, Chavan S, Jorba J, Wassilak SG, Ahmed J, Snider CJ |title=Surveillance to Track Progress Toward Polio Eradication - Worldwide, 2017-2018| journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report| volume=68| number=13| pages=312\u2013318| date=April 2019| doi=10.15585/mmwr.mm6813a4| pmid=30946737 |pmc=6611474 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/pdfs/mm6813-H.pdf }}</ref>\n\nEnvironmental surveillance is used to supplement AFP surveillance. This entails the routine testing of sewage samples for the presence of virus. This not only allows the effectiveness of vaccination efforts to be evaluated in countries with active transmission, but also allows the detection of new outbreaks in countries without known transmission. In 2018, the GPEI conducted environmental surveillance in 44 countries, 24 of which are in Africa.<ref name=\"surv\" />\n\n=== Obstacles ===\n\nAmong the greatest obstacles to global polio eradication are the lack of basic health infrastructure, which limits vaccine distribution and delivery, the crippling effects of civil war and internal strife, and the sometimes oppositional stance that marginalized communities take against what is perceived as a potentially hostile intervention by outsiders. Another challenge has been maintaining the [[Potency (pharmacology)|potency]] of live (attenuated) vaccines in extremely hot or remote areas. The oral polio vaccine must be kept at {{convert|2|to|8|C|F}} for vaccination to be successful.<ref name= Watch/>\n\nAn independent evaluation of obstacles to polio eradication requested by the WHO and conducted in 2009 considered the major obstacles in detail by country. In Afghanistan and Pakistan, they concluded that the most significant barrier was insecurity; but that managing human resources, political pressures, the movement of large populations between and within both countries, inadequately resourced health facilities, also posed problems, as well as technical issues with the vaccine. In [[India]], the major challenge appeared to be the high efficiency of transmission within the populations of [[Bihar]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]] states, set against the low (~80% after three doses against type{{nbsp}}1) [[seroconversion]] response seen from the vaccine. In Nigeria, meanwhile, the most critical barriers identified were management issues, in particular the highly variable importance ascribed to polio by different authorities at the local government level, although funding issues, community perceptions of vaccine safety, inadequate mobilisation of community groups, and issues with the cold chain also played a role. Finally, in those countries where international spread from endemic countries had resulted in transmission becoming re-established\u2014namely [[Angola]], [[Chad]], and [[South Sudan]], the key issues identified were underdeveloped health systems and low routine vaccine coverage, although low resources committed to Angola and South Sudan for the purpose of curtailing the spread of polio and climatic factors were also identified as playing a role.<ref name=evaluation>{{cite web|title=Polio Eradication Evaluation |url=http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/Polio_Evaluation_Report.asp |accessdate=19 February 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706172238/http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/Polio_Evaluation_Report.asp |archivedate=6 July 2010 }}</ref>\n\nTwo additional challenges are found in unobserved polio transmission and in vaccine-derived poliovirus.
