Each individual bacterium is a rounded cylinder.]]\n\nCertain strains of ''E. coli'', such as [[Escherichia coli O157:H7|O157:H7]], [[Escherichia coli O104:H4|O104:H4]], [[Escherichia coli O121|O121]], [[Escherichia coli O26|O26]], [[Escherichia coli O103:|O103]], [[Escherichia coli O111|O111]], [[Escherichia coli O145|O145]], and [[Escherichia coli O104:H21|O104:H21]], produce potentially lethal [[toxin]]s. [[Food poisoning]] caused by ''E. coli'' can result from eating unwashed vegetables or poorly butchered and undercooked meat. O157:H7 is also notorious for causing serious and even life-threatening complications such as [[hemolytic-uremic syndrome]]. This particular strain is linked to the [[2006 United States E. coli outbreak|2006 United States ''E. coli'' outbreak]] due to fresh spinach. The [[Escherichia coli O104:H4|O104:H4]] strain is equally virulent. Antibiotic and supportive treatment protocols for it are not as well-developed (it has the ability to be very enterohemorrhagic like O157:H7, causing bloody diarrhea, but also is more enteroaggregative, meaning it adheres well and clumps to intestinal membranes). It is the strain behind the deadly June [[2011 E. coli outbreak]] in Europe. Severity of the illness varies considerably; it can be fatal, particularly to young children, the elderly or the immunocompromised, but is more often mild. Earlier, poor hygienic methods of preparing meat in Scotland killed seven people in 1996 due to ''E. coli'' poisoning, and left hundreds more infected. ''E. coli'' can harbour both [[heat-stable enterotoxin|heat-stable]] and [[heat-labile enterotoxin]]s. The latter, termed LT, contain one A subunit and five B subunits arranged into one holotoxin, and are highly similar in structure and function to [[cholera]] toxins. The B subunits assist in adherence and entry of the toxin into host intestinal cells, while the A subunit is cleaved and prevents cells from absorbing water, causing [[diarrhea]]. LT is secreted by the Type 2 secretion pathway.<ref>{{cite  journal  |vauthors=Tauschek M, Gorrell R, Robins-Browne RM |title=Identification of a protein secretory pathway for the secretion of heat-labile enterotoxin by an enterotoxigenic strain of Escherichia coli | journal=PNAS | volume=99 |pages=7066\u201371 | url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/99/10/7066 | pmid = 12011463  | doi = 10.1073/pnas.092152899 | issue=10 | pmc=124529 | year=2002}}</ref>\n\nIf ''E. coli'' bacteria escape the intestinal tract through a perforation (for example from an [[Peptic ulcer|ulcer]], a [[ruptured appendix]], or due to a [[surgical error]]) and enter the abdomen, they usually cause [[peritonitis]] that can be fatal without prompt treatment.

[[Food poisoning]] caused by ''E. coli'' can result from eating unwashed vegetables or poorly butchered and undercooked meat. O157:H7 is also notorious for causing serious and even life-threatening complications such as [[hemolytic-uremic syndrome]]. This particular strain is linked to the [[2006 United States E. coli outbreak|2006 United States ''E. coli'' outbreak]] due to fresh spinach. The [[Escherichia coli O104:H4|O104:H4]] strain is equally virulent. Antibiotic and supportive treatment protocols for it are not as well-developed (it has the ability to be very enterohemorrhagic like O157:H7, causing bloody diarrhea, but also is more enteroaggregative, meaning it adheres well and clumps to intestinal membranes). It is the strain behind the deadly June [[2011 E. coli outbreak]] in Europe. Severity of the illness varies considerably; it can be fatal, particularly to young children, the elderly or the immunocompromised, but is more often mild. Earlier, poor hygienic methods of preparing meat in Scotland killed seven people in 1996 due to ''E. coli'' poisoning, and left hundreds more infected. ''E. coli'' can harbour both [[heat-stable enterotoxin|heat-stable]] and [[heat-labile enterotoxin]]s. The latter, termed LT, contain one A subunit and five B subunits arranged into one holotoxin, and are highly similar in structure and function to [[cholera]] toxins. The B subunits assist in adherence and entry of the toxin into host intestinal cells, while the A subunit is cleaved and prevents cells from absorbing water, causing [[diarrhea]]. LT is secreted by the Type 2 secretion pathway.<ref>{{cite  journal  |vauthors=Tauschek M, Gorrell R, Robins-Browne RM |title=Identification of a protein secretory pathway for the secretion of heat-labile enterotoxin by an enterotoxigenic strain of Escherichia coli | journal=PNAS | volume=99 |pages=7066\u201371 | url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/99/10/7066 | pmid = 12011463  | doi = 10.1073/pnas.092152899 | issue=10 | pmc=124529 | year=2002}}</ref>\n\nIf ''E. coli'' bacteria escape the intestinal tract through a perforation (for example from an [[Peptic ulcer|ulcer]], a [[ruptured appendix]], or due to a [[surgical error]]) and enter the abdomen, they usually cause [[peritonitis]] that can be fatal without prompt treatment.

ETEC can produce two [[protein]]aceous [[enterotoxins]]:\n\n* The larger of the two proteins, '''[[LT enterotoxin]]''', is similar to [[cholera toxin]] in structure and function.\n* The smaller protein, '''[[ST enterotoxin]]''' causes [[Cyclic guanosine monophosphate|cGMP]] accumulation in the target cells and a subsequent secretion of fluid and electrolytes into the intestinal [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]].\n\nETEC strains are noninvasive, and they do not leave the intestinal lumen. ETEC is the leading bacterial cause of diarrhea in children in the developing world, as well as the most common cause of [[traveler's diarrhea]]. Each year, there are estimated to be 840 million cases of ETEC in developing countries. About 280 million of these cases, as well as 325,000 deaths, are in children under the age of five.<ref name=Croxen2013 />\n|-\n| '''Enteropathogenic ''E. coli''''' (EPEC)\n| causative agent of diarrhea in humans, rabbits, dogs, cats and horses\n|Watery\n| Like ETEC, EPEC also causes diarrhea, but the molecular mechanisms of colonization and aetiology are different. EPEC lack ST and LT toxins, but they use an [[Bacterial adhesin|adhesin]] known as [[intimin]] to bind host intestinal cells. This pathotype has an array of virulence factors that are similar to those found in ''[[Shigella]]''. Adherence to the intestinal mucosa causes a rearrangement of [[actin]] in the host cell, causing significant deformation. EPEC cells are moderately invasive (i.e. they enter host cells) and elicit an inflammatory response. Changes in intestinal cell ultrastructure due to \"attachment and effacement\" is likely the prime cause of diarrhea in those afflicted with EPEC.\n|-\n| '''[[Enteroinvasive Escherichia coli|Enteroinvasive<br>''E. coli]]''' (EIEC)\n| found only in humans\n|Bloody or nonbloody\n| EIEC infection causes a syndrome that is identical to [[shigellosis]], with profuse diarrhea and high fever.\n|-\n| '''[[Shiga-like toxin-producing Escherichia coli|Enterohemorrhagic<br>''E. coli'']]''' (EHEC)\n| found in humans, cattle, and goats\n|Bloody or nonbloody\n| The most infamous member of this pathotype is strain [[O157:H7]], which causes bloody diarrhea and no fever.

However, the antibiotic sensitivities of different strains of ''E. coli'' vary widely. As [[gram-negative]] organisms, ''E. coli'' are resistant to many antibiotics that are effective against [[gram-positive]] organisms. Antibiotics which may be used to treat ''E. coli'' infection include [[amoxicillin]], as well as other semisynthetic penicillins, many [[cephalosporin]]s, [[carbapenems]], [[aztreonam]],  [[trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole]], [[ciprofloxacin]], [[nitrofurantoin]] and the [[aminoglycoside]]s.\n\n[[Antibiotic resistance]] is a growing problem. Some of this is due to [[overuse of antibiotic]]s in humans, but some of it is probably due to the use of antibiotics as growth promoters in animal feeds.<ref name=Johnson_2006>{{cite  journal  |vauthors=Johnson J, Kuskowski M, Menard M, Gajewski A, Xercavins M, Garau J |title=Similarity between human and chicken Escherichia coli isolates in relation to ciprofloxacin resistance status |journal=J Infect Dis |volume=194 |issue=1 |pages=71\u20138 |year=2006 |url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/JID/journal/issues/v194n1/35787/35787.html | pmid=16741884 | doi = 10.1086/504921  }}</ref> A study published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in August 2007 found the rate of adaptative [[mutation]]s in ''E. coli'' is \"on the order of 10<sup>\u22125</sup> per [[genome]] per generation, which is 1,000 times as high as previous estimates,\" a finding which may have significance for the study and management of bacterial antibiotic resistance.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Perfeito |first=L\u00edlia |last2=Fernandes |first2=Lisete |last3=Mota |first3=Catarina |last4=Gordo |first4=Isabel |title=Adaptive Mutations in Bacteria: High Rate and Small Effects |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=317 |issue=5839 |pages=813\u2013815 |doi=10.1126/science.1142284 |pmid=17690297 |year=2007 |hdl=10400.21/3037 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c7cf6001c2cc6b87e80520c68ac52a862009a305 }}</ref>\n\nAntibiotic-resistant ''E. coli'' may also pass on the genes responsible for antibiotic resistance to other species of bacteria, such as ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', through a process called [[horizontal gene transfer]]. ''E. coli'' bacteria often carry [[multiple drug resistance]] plasmids, and under stress, readily transfer those plasmids to other species. Mixing of species in the intestines allows ''E. coli'' to accept and transfer [[plasmid]]s from and to other bacteria. Thus, ''E. coli'' and the other [[enterobacteriaceae|enterobacteria]] are important reservoirs of transferable antibiotic resistance.<ref>{{cite  journal  |vauthors=Salyers AA, Gupta A, Wang Y |title=Human intestinal bacteria as reservoirs for antibiotic resistance genes |journal=Trends Microbiol. |volume=12 |issue=9 |pages=412\u20136 |year=2004 |pmid=15337162 | doi = 10.1016/j.tim.2004.07.004  }}</ref>\n\n=== Beta-lactamase strains ===\nResistance to [[beta-lactam antibiotic]]s has become a particular problem in recent decades, as strains of bacteria that produce extended-spectrum [[beta-lactamase]]s have become more common.<ref>{{cite  journal  |vauthors=Paterson DL, Bonomo RA |title=Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases: a clinical update |journal=Clin.
