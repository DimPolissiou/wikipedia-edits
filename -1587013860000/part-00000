It was first [[Scientific description|described]] by British zoologist [[Oldfield Thomas]] in 1910, who procured four specimens from [[Nha Trang]] in [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]]. Sighted only thrice in the wild, little is known about the distribution and ecology of this mouse-deer. After 1910, the Vietnam mouse-deer was reported +next in 1990 near Dak Rong and Buon Luoi in the [[Gia Lai Province]]. With increasing hunting pressure, habitat loss due to deforestation and no more reports of the species in the wild, the mouse-deer was feared to have gone extinct. The [[IUCN]] listed the species as [[Data Deficient]] in 2008. In 2019, a study confirmed the existence of the Vietnam mouse-deer in dry low-lying forests of southern Vietnam with [[camera trap]] evidence. This mouse-deer is characterised by a rough coat with a strange double-tone coloration unseen in other chevrotains; the front part of the body is reddish brown and contrasts strongly with the greyish posterior. It has big reddish brown ears, white and dark reddish brown marks on the throat.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe Vietnam mouse-deer was first [[Scientific description|described]] by British zoologist [[Oldfield Thomas]] in 1910 by the [[Binomial nomenclature|name]] ''Tragulus versicolor''.<ref name=thomas>{{cite journal |last=Thomas |first=Oldfield |authorlink=Oldfield Thomas|year=1910 |journal=The Annals and Magazine of Natural History |series=8 |volume=5 |page=535 |issue=25\u201330 |title=''Tragulus versicolor'' |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/54587#page/571/mode/1up}}</ref><ref name=msw3>{{MSW3|page=650|id=14200183}}</ref> In the past this mouse-deer was generally treated as a [[subspecies]] of the [[greater mouse-deer]] (''T.&nbsp;napu''), though it more closely resembles the [[lesser mouse-deer]] (''T.&nbsp;kanchil''). In a taxonomic revision in 2004, the Vietnam mouse-deer was identified as an independent species in ''Tragulus''.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Erik |last1=Meijaard |first2=C.P. |last2=Groves |year=2004 |url=http://zmmu.msu.ru/rjt/articles/ther3_1%2009_13%20Kuznez_Borisenko.pdf |title=A taxonomic revision of the ''Tragulus'' mouse-deer (Artiodactyla) |journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=140 |issue=1 |pages=63\u2013102 |doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.2004.00091.x}}</ref>\n\n==Status and sightings==\nInformation on the distribution and ecology of this mouse-deer is scarce; it is [[endemic]] to Vietnam and has been sighted only thrice in the wild. The four specimens obtained by Thomas were from [[Nha Trang]] ({{Coord|12|15|N|109|10|E}}) in [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]] on the southern coast of Vietnam; this need not be the original location for the species, as the specimens could have been traded from elsewhere.<ref name=iucn/> The mouse-deer was not reported for another 80 years until a Vietnamese-Russian expedition procured an adult male specimen from local hunters near Dak Rong and Buon Luoi in the [[Gia Lai Province]]. This specimen, initially assumed to be a [[Java mouse-deer]] (''T. javanicus''), was deposited in the [[Zoological Museum of Moscow University]]. A reexamination in 2004 identified the specimen as a Vietnam mouse-deer, noting its strange coloration compared to other chevrotains.<ref name=new2004>{{cite journal |last1=Kuznetsov |first1=G.

It was first [[Scientific description|described]] by British zoologist [[Oldfield Thomas]] in 1910, who procured four specimens from [[Nha Trang]] in [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]]. Sighted only thrice in the wild, little is known about the distribution and ecology of this mouse-deer. After 1910, the Vietnam mouse-deer was reported +next in 1990 near Dak Rong and Buon Luoi in the [[Gia Lai Province]]. With increasing hunting pressure, habitat loss due to deforestation and no more reports of the species in the wild, the mouse-deer was feared to have gone extinct. The [[IUCN]] listed the species as [[Data Deficient]] in 2008. In 2019, a study confirmed the existence of the Vietnam mouse-deer in dry low-lying forests of southern Vietnam with [[camera trap]] evidence. This mouse-deer is characterised by a rough coat with a strange double-tone coloration unseen in other chevrotains; the front part of the body is reddish brown and contrasts strongly with the greyish posterior. It has big reddish brown ears, white and dark reddish brown marks on the throat.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe Vietnam mouse-deer was first [[Scientific description|described]] by British zoologist [[Oldfield Thomas]] in 1910 by the [[Binomial nomenclature|name]] ''Tragulus versicolor''.<ref name=thomas>{{cite journal |last=Thomas |first=Oldfield |authorlink=Oldfield Thomas|year=1910 |journal=The Annals and Magazine of Natural History |series=8 |volume=5 |page=535 |issue=25\u201330 |title=''Tragulus versicolor'' |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/54587#page/571/mode/1up}}</ref><ref name=msw3>{{MSW3|page=650|id=14200183}}</ref> In the past this mouse-deer was generally treated as a [[subspecies]] of the [[greater mouse-deer]] (''T.&nbsp;napu''), though it more closely resembles the [[lesser mouse-deer]] (''T.&nbsp;kanchil''). In a taxonomic revision in 2004, the Vietnam mouse-deer was identified as an independent species in ''Tragulus''.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Erik |last1=Meijaard |first2=C.P. |last2=Groves |year=2004 |url=http://zmmu.msu.ru/rjt/articles/ther3_1%2009_13%20Kuznez_Borisenko.pdf |title=A taxonomic revision of the ''Tragulus'' mouse-deer (Artiodactyla) |journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=140 |issue=1 |pages=63\u2013102 |doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.2004.00091.x}}</ref>\n\n==Status and sightings==\nInformation on the distribution and ecology of this mouse-deer is scarce; it is [[endemic]] to Vietnam and has been sighted only thrice in the wild. The four specimens obtained by Thomas were from [[Nha Trang]] ({{Coord|12|15|N|109|10|E}}) in [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]] on the southern coast of Vietnam; this need not be the original location for the species, as the specimens could have been traded from elsewhere.<ref name=iucn/> The mouse-deer was not reported for another 80 years until a Vietnamese-Russian expedition procured an adult male specimen from local hunters near Dak Rong and Buon Luoi in the [[Gia Lai Province]]. This specimen, initially assumed to be a [[Java mouse-deer]] (''T. javanicus''), was deposited in the [[Zoological Museum of Moscow University]]. A reexamination in 2004 identified the specimen as a Vietnam mouse-deer, noting its strange coloration compared to other chevrotains.<ref name=new2004>{{cite journal |last1=Kuznetsov |first1=G.
