He was also a [[biblical]] scholar, a [[classicism|classicist]], and a talented musician.\n\n==Life==\nGranville Sharp was the son of Judith Wheler (d. 1757) and [[Thomas Sharp (archdeacon)|Thomas Sharp]] (1693\u20131759), Archdeacon of Northumberland, prolific theological writer and biographer of his father, [[John Sharp (archbishop)|John Sharp]], [[Archbishop of York]]. Judith was the daughter of travel writer [[George Wheler (clergyman and scholar)|George Wheler]] and Grace n\u00e9e Higgons, who grew up in the political household of Sir [[Thomas Higgons]].\n\nSharp was born in [[Durham, England|Durham]] in 1735. He had eight older brothers and five younger sisters. Five of his brothers survived their infancy and by the time Sharp had reached his midteens the family funds set aside for their education had been all but depleted, so Sharp was educated at [[Durham School]]<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ditchfield |first= G.

Sharp loved to argue and debate, and his keen intellect found little outlet in the mundane work in which he was involved.  However, one of his fellow-apprentices was [[Socinianism|Socinian]] (a Unitarian sect that denied the divinity of Christ), and in order better to argue, Sharp taught himself [[Greek language|Greek]].  Another fellow apprentice was Jewish, and so Sharp learned [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] in order to be able to discuss theological matters with his colleague. Sharp also conducted genealogical research for one of his masters, [[Henry Willoughby, 13th Baron Willoughby of Parham|Henry Willoughby]], who had a claim to the barony of [[Baron Willoughby of Parham|Willoughby de Parham]], and it was through Sharp's work that Willoughby was able to take his place in the House of Lords.\n\nSharp's apprenticeship ended in 1757, and both his parents died soon after. That same year he accepted a position as Clerk in the Ordnance Office at the [[Tower of London]]. This civil service position allowed him plenty of free time to pursue his scholarly and intellectual pursuits.<ref name=Sheppard/> \n \n[[File:The Sharp Family by Johann Zoffany.jpg|thumb|left|''The Sharp Family'', by [[Johann Zoffany]], 1779\u201381, National Portrait Gallery, London. The family musical ensemble are pictured on their barge, ''Apollo'', with [[All Saints Church, Fulham]] in the background.  Granville Sharp is the seated male figure in the centre.]]\n\nSharp had a keen musical interest. Four of his siblings \u2013 [[William Sharp (surgeon)|William]], later to become surgeon to [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], James, Elizabeth and Judith \u2013 had also come to London, and they met every day.  They all played musical instruments as a family orchestra, giving concerts at William's house in [[Mincing Lane]] and later in the family sailing barge, ''Apollo'', which was moored at the Bishop of London's steps in [[Fulham]], near William's country home, [[Fulham House]].<ref>Fulham at the time was a village surrounded by countryside, not part of the Greater London conurbation as today.  The Sharps' Fulham House is not the house now known as Fulham House \u2013 the Sharps' Fulham House was demolished in the 1840s, and stood roughly where the Putney Travel Inn stands today.</ref> The fortnightly water-borne concerts took place from 1775\u20131783, the year his brother James died. Sharp had an excellent bass voice, described by George III as \"the best in Britain\", and he played the clarinet, oboe, flageolet, kettle drums, harp and a double-flute which he had made himself. He often signed his name in notes to friends as [[G\u266f (musical note)|G\u266f]].<ref name=Sheppard/> \n \nSharp died at Fulham House on 6 July 1813, and a memorial of him was erected in [[Westminster Abbey]].  He lived in [[Fulham]], London, and was buried in the churchyard of [[All Saints Church, Fulham]]. The vicar would not allow a funeral sermon to be preached in the church because Sharp had been involved with the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]], which was Nonconformist.<ref name=Sheppard/>\n\n==Abolitionism==\nSharp is best known for his untiring efforts for the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition of slavery]], although he was involved in many other causes, fired by a dislike of any social or legal injustice.\n\n===Sharp's first involvement: Jonathan Strong===\nSharp's brother William held a regular surgery for the local poor at his surgery at Mincing Lane, and one day in 1765 when Sharp was visiting, he met Jonathan Strong. Strong was a young black slave from Barbados who had been badly beaten by his master, David Lisle, a lawyer, with a pistol to the head. This left him close to blindness and as a result was cast out into the street as useless.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Ruth Anna|date=1943|title=Granville Sharp and Lord Mansfield|journal=The Journal of Negro History|volume=28|issue=4|pages=381\u2013389|doi=10.2307/2714946|jstor=2714946}}</ref> Sharp and his brother tended to his injuries and had him admitted to [[Barts Hospital]], where his injuries were so bad they necessitated a four-month stay.

Two slave catchers captured Strong with the intention to ship him to the Caribbean where he would work on Kerr's plantation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://abolition.e2bn.org/people_22.html |title=Granville Sharp (1735-1813): The Civil Servant |last= |first= |date= |website=The Abolition Project |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> Strong was able to get word to Sharp, who went directly to the Lord Mayor who in turn convened those laying claim to Jonathan Strong.[1] In court Mr. Macbean, Kerr's attorney, produced the bill of sales from when Lisle sold Strong to Kerr. That was not enough to convince the Lord Mayor because Strong was imprisoned without clear cause, and so he liberated Strong. Afterwards, a West India Captain named David Laird grabbed Jonathan Strong's arm and claimed he would take him as James Kerr's property. Sharp, at the suggestion of Thomas Beech, the Coroner of London, threatened to charge Laird with assault should he attempt to take Strong by force. Laird let go of Strong and everyone who had been summoned departed without further dispute.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAfterwards, David Laird instituted a court action against Sharp claiming \u00a3200 damages for taking their property, and Lisle challenged Sharp to a duel\u2014Sharp told Lisle that he could expect satisfaction from the law. Sharp consulted lawyers and found that as the law stood it favoured the master's rights to his slaves as property: that a slave remained in law the chattel of his master even on English soil. Sharp said \"he could not believe the law of England was really so injurious to [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]].\"  He spent the next two years in  study of English law, especially where it applied to the liberty of the individual.\n\nLisle disappeared from the records early, but Kerr persisted with his suit through eight legal terms before it was dismissed, and Kerr was ordered to pay substantial damages for wasting the court's time. Jonathan Strong was free, even if the law had not been changed, but he only lived for five years as a free man, dying at 25.<ref name=Sheppard/>\n\n===Increasing involvement===\n[[File:William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield]].]]\n\nThe Strong case made a name for Sharp as the \"protector of the Negro\"{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} and he was approached by two more slaves, although in both cases (''Hylas v Newton'' and ''[[Slavery at common law#R v Stapylton|R v Stapylton]]'') the results were unsatisfactory, and it became plain that the judiciary \u2013 and [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Lord Mansfield]], the Chief Justice of the King's Bench (the leading judge of the day) in particular \u2013 was trying very hard ''not'' to decide the issue. By this time, Great Britain was by far the largest trafficker in slaves, transporting more Africans across the Atlantic than all other nations put together, and the slave trade and slave labour were important to the British economy.\n\nIn 1769 Sharp published ''A Representation of the Injustice and Dangerous Tendency of Tolerating Slavery ...'', the first tract in England attacking slavery. Within it, he argues that \"the laws of nature\" grant equality to all humans regardless of any artificial laws imposed by society. He also condemns slave contracts because the liberty of a man cannot be matched in value by anything.<ref name=\":1\" /> Sharp's work attracted the attention of [[James Oglethorpe]], who had long been concerned with slavery as a moral issue. The two men remained close until Oglethorpe's death in 1785.<ref>Wilson, Thomas. ''The Oglethorpe Plan'' (Epilogue). Charlottesville, Va: University of Virginia Press, 2012.</ref>\n\n=== [[Somerset v Stewart]] ===\n(Also called [[Somersett's Case]].) On 13 January 1772, Sharp was visited and asked for help by James Somerset, an indigenous person of Africa who had been brought to America to be sold in the Colony of Virginia. He was then taken to England with his master Charles Stewart in 1769, where he was able to run away in October 1771. After evading slave hunters employed by Stewart for 56 days, Somerset had been caught and put in the slave ship Ann and Mary, to be taken to Jamaica and sold.<ref name=\":0\" /> This was the perfect case for Sharp because, unlike the previous cases, this was a question of lawful slavery rather of ownership. Three Londoners had applied to [[Lord Mansfield]] for a writ of [[habeas corpus]], which had been granted, with Somerset having to appear at a hearing on 24 January 1772. Members of the public responded to Somerset's plight by sending money to pay for his lawyers (who in the event all gave their services ''[[pro bono publico]]''), while Stewart's costs were met by the West Indian planters and merchants.\n\nHaving studied English law for several years now, Sharp called on his now-formidable knowledge of the law regarding individual liberty and briefed Somerset's lawyers.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1980|title=Robert E.

It was a clear victory for Somerset, Sharp and the lawyers who acted for Somerset. Mansfield acknowledged that English law did not allow slavery, and only a new Act of Parliament (\"[[positive law]]\") could bring it into legality.  However, the verdict in the case is often misunderstood to mean the end of slavery in England. It was no such thing: it dealt only with the question of the forcible sending of someone overseas into bondage; a slave becomes free the moment he sets foot on English territory. It was one of the most significant achievements in the campaign to abolish slavery throughout the world, more for its effect than for its actual legal weight.<ref name=Sheppard/>\n\n===The ''Zong'' Massacre===\nIn 1781 the crew of the over-capacity slaver ship ''[[Zong Massacre|Zong]]'' massacred an estimated 132<ref>The exact number of deaths is unknown, but First Mate James Kelsall later said that \"the outside number of drowned amounted to 142 in the whole\" {{Cite journal | last1 = Lewis | first1 = Andrew | title = Martin Dockray and the ''Zong'': A Tribute in the Form of a Chronology | doi = 10.1080/01440360701698551 | journal = Journal of Legal History | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 357\u2013370| year = 2007}}</ref> slaves by tossing them overboard; an additional ten slaves threw themselves overboard in defiance or despair and over sixty people had perished through neglect, injuries, disease and overcrowding.\n\nThe ''Zong'''s crew had mis-navigated her course and underestimated water supplies; according to the [[maritime law]] notion of [[general average]], cargo purposely jettisoned at sea to save the remainder was eligible for insurance compensation. It was reasoned that as the slaves were cargo, the ship's owners would be entitled to the \u00a330 a head compensation for their loss if thrown overboard: were the slaves to die on land or at sea of so-called \"natural\" causes, no compensation would be forthcoming.<ref name=Sheppard/>\n\nThe ship's owners, a syndicate of merchants based in [[Liverpool]], filed their insurance claim; the insurers disputed it. In this first case the court found for the owners. The insurers appealed.\n\nSharp was visited on 19 March 1783 by [[Olaudah Equiano]], a famous freed slave and later to be the author of a successful autobiography, who told him of the horrific events aboard the ''Zong''. Sharp immediately became involved in the court case, facing his old adversary over slave trade matters, the [[Solicitor General for England and Wales]], [[John Lee (Attorney-General)|Mr. John Lee]]. Lee notoriously declared that \"the case was the same as if assets had been thrown overboard\", and that a master could drown slaves without \"a surmise of impropriety\".\n\nThe judge ruled that the ''Zong'''s owners could not claim insurance on the slaves: the lack of sufficient water demonstrated that the cargo had been badly managed. However, no officers or crew were charged or prosecuted for the deliberate killing of the slaves, and Sharp's attempts to mount a prosecution for murder never got off the ground.<ref name=Sheppard/>\n\n===The Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade===\n[[File:Benjamin Rush.png|thumb|Founding Father Benjamin Rush]]\nSharp was not completely alone at the beginning of the struggle: the Quakers, especially in America, were committed abolitionists. Sharp had a long and fruitful correspondence with [[Anthony Benezet]], a Quaker abolitionist in [[Pennsylvania]]. However, the Quakers were a marginal group in England, and were debarred from standing for Parliament, and they had no doubt as to who should be the chairman of the new society they were founding, The [[Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade]]. On 22 May 1787, at the inaugural meeting of the committee \u2013 nine Quakers and three Anglicans (who strengthened the committee's likelihood of influencing Parliament) \u2013 Sharp's position was unanimously agreed. In the 20 years of the society's existence, during which Sharp was ever-present at committee meetings, such was Sharp's modesty that he would never take the chair, always contriving to arrive just after the meeting had started to avoid any chance of having to take the meeting. While the committee felt it sensible to concentrate on the slave trade, Sharp felt strongly that the target should be slavery itself. On this he was out-voted, but he worked tirelessly for the Society nevertheless.<ref name=\"Sheppard\"/>\n\n===Correspondence with Benjamin Rush===\nThe correspondence between Granville Sharp and Anthony Benezet inspired [[Benjamin Rush]], a physician in Philadelphia who would later become one of the founding fathers, to contact Sharp as well. This led to a connection by letter between the two that lasted 36 years. In the first letter, written May 1, 1773, Rush attests to the increasing compassion within the colonies towards the suffering of the slaves. He makes mention of the clergy publicly arguing that slavery is a violation of both \"the laws of nature\" and Christian belief.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Woods|first=John A.|last2=Rush|first2=Benjamin|last3=Sharp|first3=Granville|date=1967|title=The Correspondence of Benjamin Rush and Granville Sharp 1773\u20141809|journal=Journal of American Studies|volume=1|issue=1|pages=1\u201338|jstor=27552761|doi=10.1017/S0021875800005946}}</ref> This detail is noteworthy because Sharp was of the belief that laws should follow both \"the laws of nature\" and that which is given in Judeo-Christian scripture.<ref name=\":2\" /> Another letter, written February 21, 1774, has Sharp providing Rush with several pamphlets, written by himself and his brothers William and James, to be shared with friends and eventually to Lord Dartmouth. Many similar exchanges of pamphlets occur throughout their correspondence, which allowed them to inspire one another and refine their arguments against slavery. The final letter of their correspondence was written June 20, 1809, four years prior to the death of both figures in 1813.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Abolition===\nWhen Sharp heard that the [[Slave Trade Act 1807|Act of Abolition]] had at last been passed by both Houses of Parliament and given Royal Assent on 25 March 1807, he fell to his knees and offered a prayer of thanksgiving.  He was now 71, and had outlived almost all of the allies and opponents of his early campaigns. He was regarded as the grand old man of the abolition struggle, and although a driving force in its early days, his place had later been taken by others such as [[Thomas Clarkson]], [[William Wilberforce]] and the [[Clapham Sect]]. Sharp, however, did not see the final abolition as he died on 6 July 1813.<ref name=Sheppard/>\n\n==The Province of Freedom==\n[[File:Province of Freedom.jpg|thumb|200px|right|View from Granville Town looking north to Bullom Shore from ''Voyages to the River Sierra Leone'' by John Matthews, 1788]]\n\nAlthough no reliable figures exist, it is thought that in the early 1780s there were around 15,000 black people in Britain, most of them without employment. Ideas were formulated for a settlement in Africa where they could return \"home\". [[Henry Smeathman]], a plant collector and [[entomologist]] who had visited Sierra Leone, propounded to the [[Committee for the Relief of the Black Poor]] that the country would be an excellent location.  Worried black people came to see Sharp, concerned that they might be re-enslaved in such a place.<ref>Michael Siva, ''Why did Black Londoners not join the Sierra Leone Resettlement Scheme 1783-1815?'' (London: Open University, 2014), p. 20-4.</ref><ref>Simon Schama, ''Rough Crossings'' (London: BBC Books, 2005), pp. 183-5.</ref>\n\nSharp took to the idea with alacrity: he saw it as a perfect opportunity to create a new model society from scratch. He drew up plans and regulations, and persuaded the Treasury to finance the ships and pay \u00a312 a head to each embarking settler. He named the new, egalitarian, peaceful Christian society-to-be \"[[Cline Town, Sierra Leone|The Province of Freedom]]\".<ref>Simon Schama, ''Rough Crossings'' (London: BBC Books, 2005), pp. 185-194</ref>\n\nThe utopian ideal quickly went sour in the face of tremendous logistical difficulties; fire broke out even before the ships had left London. Sharp's friend, [[Olaudah Equiano]], highlighted corruption in the process of stocking the ships, and was dismissed as a result; 411 people sailed for Africa, including some 60 white women without Sharp's knowledge, married to the male settlers. It is unclear how many were previously betrothed and how many married in preparation for the journey; traditionally these women have been characterized as prostitutes from Deptford. However, historians have since dismissed that description as false.<ref name=\"Simon Schama 2005 pp. 200-16\">Simon Schama, ''Rough Crossings'' (London: BBC Books, 2005), pp. 200-16.</ref><ref>Michael Siva, ''Why did Black Londoners not join the Sierra Leone Resettlement Scheme 1783-1815?'' (London: Open University, 2014), p. 28-33, 40-3.</ref> The settlers arrived in May 1787, at the onset of the five-month rainy season, and a settlement of sorts was built, named Granville Town. The commander of the naval escort that had brought the settlers concluded that they were unfit for the complex challenge of founding a new settlement in a potentially hostile environment.<ref name=\"Simon Schama 2005 pp. 200-16\"/> One of the settlers whom Granville had rescued from a slave ship left the settlement to work in the slave trade, much to Sharp's despair. By the end of 1788 Sharp had poured \u00a31,735 18s 8d of his own money into the settlement. In 1789 Granville Town was burned to the ground by a local [[Temne people|Temne]] chief; this may have been in retaliation for the burning of a Temne by a slave-trader.<ref name=Sheppard/>\n\nThrough The Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade, in 1790 Granville came into contact with [[Thomas Peters (black leader)|Thomas Peters]], a former American slave who fought with the British during revolution in return for freedom. Sharp was instrumental in helping Peters to establish [[Freetown]], Sierra Leone. Sharp is considered to be one of the founders of Sierra Leone alongside Thomas Peters and the Clarkson brothers ([[Thomas Clarkson]] and [[John Clarkson (abolitionist)|John Clarkson]]).\n\n==Other activism==\n[[File:Granville Sharp medallion.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A white glass medallion of Granville Sharp by [[Catherine Andras]], made on 2 April 1809.]]\n\nSharp ardently sympathized with the revolt of the [[American Revolution|American colonists]]. He believed in peace in America, but he also believed they were entitled to \"Equitable Representation\", an idea repeated in the famous phrase \"[[No taxation without representation]]\". When he realised his job in the Ordnance Office meant sending equipment to British forces fighting the colonists, he took leave of absence. As the war continued, he wrote to his employers \"I cannot return to my ordnance duty whilst a bloody war is carried on, unjustly, against my fellow-subjects.\" Eventually in 1776 he resigned, never to have paid employment again and supported willingly by his brothers, who were happy to see him dedicate his time to his various causes.<ref name=Sheppard/>\n\nSharp also advocated parliamentary reform and the legislative independence of [[Ireland]], and agitated against the [[impressment]] of sailors for the [[Royal Navy|Navy]]. It was through his efforts that bishops for the [[United States|United States of America]] were consecrated by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in 1787.  He also argued for the reform of Parliament based on [[Magna Carta]] and to back this up he devised the doctrine of accumulative authority. This doctrine stated that because almost innumerable parliaments had approved Magna Carta it would take the same number of Parliaments to repeal it. Like many others, Sharp accepted the supremacy of Parliament as an institution, but did not believe that this power was without restraint, and thought that Parliament could not repeal Magna Carta.\n\nSharp was also one of the founders and the first President of the British and Foreign Bible Society and of the Society for the Conversion of the Jews.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Classical grammarian==\nOne of Granville's letters written in 1778 (published in 1798), propounded what has come to be known as '''The Granville Sharp Rule''' (in actuality only the first of six principles that Sharp articulated involving the Greek article):\n\n:\u201cWhen the copulative ''kai'' connects two [[noun]]s of the same [[case (linguistics)|case]], if the article ''ho'', or any of its cases, precedes the first of the said nouns or participles, and is not repeated before the second noun or participle, the latter always relates to the same person that is expressed or described by the first noun or participle ...\u201d<ref name=Sharp>{{cite book | last = Sharp | first =  Granville | authorlink = | title = Remarks on the Uses of the Definitive Article in the Greek Text of the New Testament, Containing Many New Proofs of the Divinity of Christ, from Passages Which Are Wrongly Translated in the Common English Version | publisher = | year = 1798| location = London | page = 8 | url = http://www.theologue.org/downloads/sharp.pdf | isbn = }}</ref>\n\nThis rule, if true, has a profound bearing on Unitarian doctrine, which led to a \u2018celebrated controversy\u2019, in which many leading divines took part, including [[Christopher Wordsworth]].\n\nFor a full discussion of Sharp's Rule and its application to passages in the New Testament which teach the deity of Christ, see the series \"The Greek Article and the Doctrine of Christ's Deity,\" by Clifford Kuehne. This series appeared in several issues of the ''Journal of Theology'' of the Church of the Lutheran Confession, and it is available for reading at the following web site: http://jot.clclutheran.org/christs-deity/ This series also discusses the application of Colwell's Rule to John 1:1.\n\nDaniel B. Wallace says about Sharp:\n\n:\u201cHis strong belief in Christ\u2019s deity led him to study the Scriptures in the original in order to defend more ably that precious truth ... As he studied the Scriptures in the original, he noticed a certain pattern, namely, when the construction article-noun-\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9-noun involved personal nouns which were singular and not proper names, they always referred to the same person. He noticed further that this rule applied in several texts to the deity of Jesus Christ.\u201d<ref name=Wallace1983>{{cite journal | last = Wallace | first = Daniel B. | authorlink = | title = The Semantic Range of the Article-Noun-Kai'-Noun Plural Construction in the New Testament | journal = [[Grace Theological Journal]] | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | page = 61 | year = 1983 | url = http://faculty.gordon.edu/hu/bi/ted_hildebrandt/New_Testament_Greek/Text/Wallace-ArticleNoun-GTJ.pdf | doi =  | accessdate = 2008-12-19}}</ref>\n\nBut Wallace claims that this rule is often too broadly applied. \u201cSharp\u2019s rule Number 1\u201d does not always work with plural forms of personal titles. Instead, a phrase that follows the form article-noun-\u201cand\u201d-noun, when the nouns involved are plurals, can involve two entirely distinct groups, two overlapping groups, two groups of which is one a subset of the other, or two identical groups.<ref>Wallace 1983, pp. 72\u201378</ref> In other words, the rule is of very specific and limited application.\n\nOf Granville Sharp's most successful critic, Calvin Winstanley, Wallace says:\n\n:\"Winstanley conceded 'There are, you say, no exceptions, in the New Testament, to your rule; that is, I suppose, unless these particular texts [i.e. the ones Sharp used to adduce Christ's deity] be such ... it is nothing surprising to find all these particular texts in question appearing as the exceptions to your rule, and the sole exceptions ... in the New Testament'<ref name=Winstanley>{{cite book | last = Winstanley | first =  Calvin | authorlink = | title = A Vindication of Certain Passages in the Common English Version of the New Testament: Addressed to Granville Sharp, Esq | publisher = | year = 1819|edition=2nd | location =  | pages = 39\u201340 | url = | isbn = }}</ref> \u2013 an obvious concession that he could find no exceptions save for the ones he supposed exist in the christologically pregnant texts.\"<ref name=Wallace1997>{{cite book | last = Wallace | first =  Daniel B. | authorlink = | title = Greek Grammar Beyond the Basics: An Exegetical Syntax of the New Testament | publisher = | year = 1997 | location =  | page = 273, n.50 | url = | isbn = }}</ref>\n\nWhat Wallace neglects by use of ellipses (...) is the flow of Winstanley's argument as well as the character of his theology.<ref>Winstanley ''passim''</ref>  Winstanley's quote argued that one could not apply Sharp's rule to the possible exceptions unless it could be shown that extra-biblical literature also followed Sharp's rule. Through multiple examples Winstanley showed that in classical Greek and in patristic Greek \u2013 all the literature surrounding the New Testament, the rule simply did not apply consistently. Wallace's quote comes from the end of Winstanley's argument in which he clearly is not conceding the point. To complete Winstanley's argument:\n\n:\"There are, you say, no exceptions, in the New Testament, to your rule; that is, I suppose, unless these particular texts be such; which you think utterly improbable.  You would argue, then, that if these texts were exceptions, there would be more.  I do not perceive any great weight in this hypothetical reasoning.  But, however plausible it may appear, the reply is at hand.  There are no other words so likely to yield exceptions; because there are no other words, between which the insertion of the copulative, would effect so remarkable a deviation from the established form of constructing them to express one person; and of course, would so pointedly suggest a difference of signification.\"<ref>Winstanley, p. 39</ref>\n\nWinstanley was Trinitarian, but cautioned that a rule that held true only in the New Testament in all but the disputed cases was too flimsy a ground on which to try to prove the divinity of Christ to the Socinians (Unitarians). Instead he said, \"[I think] there are much more cogent arguments in reserve, when [Sharp's] rule of interpretation shall be abandoned.\"<ref>Winstanley, p. 42</ref> His biggest criticisms of Sharp's rule rest in the fact that 1) the early church fathers do not follow it and 2) the early church father's never invoked this rule to prove the divinity of Christ (though it would have been an obvious tool against such heresy).  He concludes, \"Hence it may be presumed that the doctrine then rested on other grounds.\"<ref>Winstanley, p. 43</ref>\n\nHowever, just because Wallace exaggerates Winstanley's concession does not mean that he has no evidence to refute Winstanley. Wallace argues that, for various reasons, the only two passages from Granville's eight that truly follow Sharp's rule (for textual reasons, among others) are Titus 2:13 and 2 Peter 1:1.<ref name=\"Wallace\">[http://bible.org/article/sharp-redivivus-reexamination-granville-sharp-rule ''Sharp Redivivus'' by Wallace]</ref> Wallace interacts in depth with Winstanley's critiques of Sharp and shows from grammatical, textual, linguistic, and Patristic evidence that Sharp's rule is truly valid across Classical, Biblical, Papyrological, and Patristic Greek \u2013 with some slight modification to the rules.<ref name=\"Wallace\"/> Here is how Wallace restates the issue:\n\n\"In native Greek constructions (i.e., not translation Greek), when a single article modifies two substantives connected by \u03ba\u03b1\u03af (thus, article-substantive-\u03ba\u03b1\u03af-substantive), when both substantives are (1) singular (both grammatically and semantically), (2) personal, (3) and common nouns (not proper names or ordinals), they have the same referent.\"<ref name=\"Wallace\"/><ref>This essay by Wallace is a summary of his dissertation and he has developed it further by publishing the argument as a book: ''Granville Sharp's Canon and its Kin''</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Granville Sharp's tomb.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Granville Sharp's tomb at [[All Saints Church, Fulham|All Saints', Fulham]], after restoration.]]\n\n[[File:Granville Sharp's tomb inscription.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Inscription on Granville Sharp's tomb.]]\n\nAfter his death on 6 July 1813, Granville Sharp was buried at [[All Saints Church, Fulham|All Saints' Church, Fulham]], beside his brother [[William Sharp (surgeon)|William Sharp]] and sister Elizabeth Prouse.

He also involved himself in trying to correct other social injustices. Sharp formulated the plan to settle black people in [[Sierra Leone]], and founded the [[St. George's Bay Company]], a forerunner of the [[Sierra Leone Company]]. His efforts led to both the founding of the [[Province of Freedom]], and later on [[Freetown, Sierra Leone]], and so he is considered to be one of the founding fathers of Sierra Leone. He was also a [[biblical]] scholar, a [[classicism|classicist]], and a talented musician.\n\n==Life==\nGranville Sharp was the son of Judith Wheler (d. 1757) and [[Thomas Sharp (archdeacon)|Thomas Sharp]] (1693\u20131759), Archdeacon of Northumberland, prolific theological writer and biographer of his father, [[John Sharp (archbishop)|John Sharp]], [[Archbishop of York]]. Judith was the daughter of travel writer [[George Wheler (clergyman and scholar)|George Wheler]] and Grace n\u00e9e Higgons, who grew up in the political household of Sir [[Thomas Higgons]].\n\nSharp was born in [[Durham, England|Durham]] in 1735. He had eight older brothers and five younger sisters. Five of his brothers survived their infancy and by the time Sharp had reached his midteens the family funds set aside for their education had been all but depleted, so Sharp was educated at [[Durham School]]<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ditchfield |first= G.

Sharp loved to argue and debate, and his keen intellect found little outlet in the mundane work in which he was involved.  However, one of his fellow-apprentices was [[Socinianism|Socinian]] (a Unitarian sect that denied the divinity of Christ), and in order better to argue, Sharp taught himself [[Greek language|Greek]].  Another fellow apprentice was Jewish, and so Sharp learned [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] in order to be able to discuss theological matters with his colleague. Sharp also conducted genealogical research for one of his masters, [[Henry Willoughby, 13th Baron Willoughby of Parham|Henry Willoughby]], who had a claim to the barony of [[Baron Willoughby of Parham|Willoughby de Parham]], and it was through Sharp's work that Willoughby was able to take his place in the House of Lords.\n\nSharp's apprenticeship ended in 1757, and both his parents died soon after. That same year he accepted a position as Clerk in the Ordnance Office at the [[Tower of London]]. This civil service position allowed him plenty of free time to pursue his scholarly and intellectual pursuits.<ref name=Sheppard/> \n \n[[File:The Sharp Family by Johann Zoffany.jpg|thumb|left|''The Sharp Family'', by [[Johann Zoffany]], 1779\u201381, National Portrait Gallery, London.

Granville Sharp is the seated male figure in the centre.]]\n\nSharp had a keen musical interest. Four of his siblings \u2013 [[William Sharp (surgeon)|William]], later to become surgeon to [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], James, Elizabeth and Judith \u2013 had also come to London, and they met every day.  They all played musical instruments as a family orchestra, giving concerts at William's house in [[Mincing Lane]] and later in the family sailing barge, ''Apollo'', which was moored at the Bishop of London's steps in [[Fulham]], near William's country home, [[Fulham House]].<ref>Fulham at the time was a village surrounded by countryside, not part of the Greater London conurbation as today.  The Sharps' Fulham House is not the house now known as Fulham House \u2013 the Sharps' Fulham House was demolished in the 1840s, and stood roughly where the Putney Travel Inn stands today.</ref> The fortnightly water-borne concerts took place from 1775\u20131783, the year his brother James died. Sharp had an excellent bass voice, described by George III as \"the best in Britain\", and he played the clarinet, oboe, flageolet, kettle drums, harp and a double-flute which he had made himself. He often signed his name in notes to friends as [[G\u266f (musical note)|G\u266f]].<ref name=Sheppard/> \n \nSharp died at Fulham House on 6 July 1813, and a memorial of him was erected in [[Westminster Abbey]].  He lived in [[Fulham]], London, and was buried in the churchyard of [[All Saints Church, Fulham]]. The vicar would not allow a funeral sermon to be preached in the church because Sharp had been involved with the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]], which was Nonconformist.<ref name=Sheppard/>\n\n==Abolitionism==\nSharp is best known for his untiring efforts for the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition of slavery]], although he was involved in many other causes, fired by a dislike of any social or legal injustice.\n\n===Sharp's first involvement: Jonathan Strong===\nSharp's brother William held a regular surgery for the local poor at his surgery at Mincing Lane, and one day in 1765 when Sharp was visiting, he met Jonathan Strong. Strong was a young black slave from Barbados who had been badly beaten by his master, David Lisle, a lawyer, with a pistol to the head. This left him close to blindness and as a result was cast out into the street as useless.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Ruth Anna|date=1943|title=Granville Sharp and Lord Mansfield|journal=The Journal of Negro History|volume=28|issue=4|pages=381\u2013389|doi=10.2307/2714946|jstor=2714946}}</ref> Sharp and his brother tended to his injuries and had him admitted to [[Barts Hospital]], where his injuries were so bad they necessitated a four-month stay.

Two slave catchers captured Strong with the intention to ship him to the Caribbean where he would work on Kerr's plantation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://abolition.e2bn.org/people_22.html |title=Granville Sharp (1735-1813): The Civil Servant |last= |first= |date= |website=The Abolition Project |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> Strong was able to get word to Sharp, who went directly to the Lord Mayor who in turn convened those laying claim to Jonathan Strong.[1] In court Mr. Macbean, Kerr's attorney, produced the bill of sales from when Lisle sold Strong to Kerr. That was not enough to convince the Lord Mayor because Strong was imprisoned without clear cause, and so he liberated Strong. Afterwards, a West India Captain named David Laird grabbed Jonathan Strong's arm and claimed he would take him as James Kerr's property. Sharp, at the suggestion of Thomas Beech, the Coroner of London, threatened to charge Laird with assault should he attempt to take Strong by force. Laird let go of Strong and everyone who had been summoned departed without further dispute.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAfterwards, David Laird instituted a court action against Sharp claiming \u00a3200 damages for taking their property, and Lisle challenged Sharp to a duel\u2014Sharp told Lisle that he could expect satisfaction from the law. Sharp consulted lawyers and found that as the law stood it favoured the master's rights to his slaves as property: that a slave remained in law the chattel of his master even on English soil. Sharp said \"he could not believe the law of England was really so injurious to [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]].\"  He spent the next two years in  study of English law, especially where it applied to the liberty of the individual.\n\nLisle disappeared from the records early, but Kerr persisted with his suit through eight legal terms before it was dismissed, and Kerr was ordered to pay substantial damages for wasting the court's time. Jonathan Strong was free, even if the law had not been changed, but he only lived for five years as a free man, dying at 25.<ref name=Sheppard/>\n\n===Increasing involvement===\n[[File:William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield]].]]\n\nThe Strong case made a name for Sharp as the \"protector of the Negro\"{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} and he was approached by two more slaves, although in both cases (''Hylas v Newton'' and ''[[Slavery at common law#R v Stapylton|R v Stapylton]]'') the results were unsatisfactory, and it became plain that the judiciary \u2013 and [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Lord Mansfield]], the Chief Justice of the King's Bench (the leading judge of the day) in particular \u2013 was trying very hard ''not'' to decide the issue. By this time, Great Britain was by far the largest trafficker in slaves, transporting more Africans across the Atlantic than all other nations put together, and the slave trade and slave labour were important to the British economy.\n\nIn 1769 Sharp published ''A Representation of the Injustice and Dangerous Tendency of Tolerating Slavery ...'', the first tract in England attacking slavery. Within it, he argues that \"the laws of nature\" grant equality to all humans regardless of any artificial laws imposed by society. He also condemns slave contracts because the liberty of a man cannot be matched in value by anything.<ref name=\":1\" /> Sharp's work attracted the attention of [[James Oglethorpe]], who had long been concerned with slavery as a moral issue. The two men remained close until Oglethorpe's death in 1785.<ref>Wilson, Thomas. ''The Oglethorpe Plan'' (Epilogue). Charlottesville, Va: University of Virginia Press, 2012.</ref>\n\n=== [[Somerset v Stewart]] ===\n(Also called [[Somersett's Case]].) On 13 January 1772, Sharp was visited and asked for help by James Somerset, an indigenous person of Africa who had been brought to America to be sold in the Colony of Virginia. He was then taken to England with his master Charles Stewart in 1769, where he was able to run away in October 1771. After evading slave hunters employed by Stewart for 56 days, Somerset had been caught and put in the slave ship Ann and Mary, to be taken to Jamaica and sold.<ref name=\":0\" /> This was the perfect case for Sharp because, unlike the previous cases, this was a question of lawful slavery rather of ownership. Three Londoners had applied to [[Lord Mansfield]] for a writ of [[habeas corpus]], which had been granted, with Somerset having to appear at a hearing on 24 January 1772. Members of the public responded to Somerset's plight by sending money to pay for his lawyers (who in the event all gave their services ''[[pro bono publico]]''), while Stewart's costs were met by the West Indian planters and merchants.\n\nHaving studied English law for several years now, Sharp called on his now-formidable knowledge of the law regarding individual liberty and briefed Somerset's lawyers.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1980|title=Robert E.

It was a clear victory for Somerset, Sharp and the lawyers who acted for Somerset. Mansfield acknowledged that English law did not allow slavery, and only a new Act of Parliament (\"[[positive law]]\") could bring it into legality.  However, the verdict in the case is often misunderstood to mean the end of slavery in England. It was no such thing: it dealt only with the question of the forcible sending of someone overseas into bondage; a slave becomes free the moment he sets foot on English territory. It was one of the most significant achievements in the campaign to abolish slavery throughout the world, more for its effect than for its actual legal weight.<ref name=Sheppard/>\n\n===The ''Zong'' Massacre===\nIn 1781 the crew of the over-capacity slaver ship ''[[Zong Massacre|Zong]]'' massacred an estimated 132<ref>The exact number of deaths is unknown, but First Mate James Kelsall later said that \"the outside number of drowned amounted to 142 in the whole\" {{Cite journal | last1 = Lewis | first1 = Andrew | title = Martin Dockray and the ''Zong'': A Tribute in the Form of a Chronology | doi = 10.1080/01440360701698551 | journal = Journal of Legal History | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 357\u2013370| year = 2007}}</ref> slaves by tossing them overboard; an additional ten slaves threw themselves overboard in defiance or despair and over sixty people had perished through neglect, injuries, disease and overcrowding.\n\nThe ''Zong'''s crew had mis-navigated her course and underestimated water supplies; according to the [[maritime law]] notion of [[general average]], cargo purposely jettisoned at sea to save the remainder was eligible for insurance compensation. It was reasoned that as the slaves were cargo, the ship's owners would be entitled to the \u00a330 a head compensation for their loss if thrown overboard: were the slaves to die on land or at sea of so-called \"natural\" causes, no compensation would be forthcoming.<ref name=Sheppard/>\n\nThe ship's owners, a syndicate of merchants based in [[Liverpool]], filed their insurance claim; the insurers disputed it. In this first case the court found for the owners. The insurers appealed.\n\nSharp was visited on 19 March 1783 by [[Olaudah Equiano]], a famous freed slave and later to be the author of a successful autobiography, who told him of the horrific events aboard the ''Zong''. Sharp immediately became involved in the court case, facing his old adversary over slave trade matters, the [[Solicitor General for England and Wales]], [[John Lee (Attorney-General)|Mr. John Lee]]. Lee notoriously declared that \"the case was the same as if assets had been thrown overboard\", and that a master could drown slaves without \"a surmise of impropriety\".\n\nThe judge ruled that the ''Zong'''s owners could not claim insurance on the slaves: the lack of sufficient water demonstrated that the cargo had been badly managed. However, no officers or crew were charged or prosecuted for the deliberate killing of the slaves, and Sharp's attempts to mount a prosecution for murder never got off the ground.<ref name=Sheppard/>\n\n===The Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade===\n[[File:Benjamin Rush.png|thumb|Founding Father Benjamin Rush]]\nSharp was not completely alone at the beginning of the struggle: the Quakers, especially in America, were committed abolitionists. Sharp had a long and fruitful correspondence with [[Anthony Benezet]], a Quaker abolitionist in [[Pennsylvania]]. However, the Quakers were a marginal group in England, and were debarred from standing for Parliament, and they had no doubt as to who should be the chairman of the new society they were founding, The [[Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade]]. On 22 May 1787, at the inaugural meeting of the committee \u2013 nine Quakers and three Anglicans (who strengthened the committee's likelihood of influencing Parliament) \u2013 Sharp's position was unanimously agreed. In the 20 years of the society's existence, during which Sharp was ever-present at committee meetings, such was Sharp's modesty that he would never take the chair, always contriving to arrive just after the meeting had started to avoid any chance of having to take the meeting. While the committee felt it sensible to concentrate on the slave trade, Sharp felt strongly that the target should be slavery itself. On this he was out-voted, but he worked tirelessly for the Society nevertheless.<ref name=\"Sheppard\"/>\n\n===Correspondence with Benjamin Rush===\nThe correspondence between Granville Sharp and Anthony Benezet inspired [[Benjamin Rush]], a physician in Philadelphia who would later become one of the founding fathers, to contact Sharp as well. This led to a connection by letter between the two that lasted 36 years. In the first letter, written May 1, 1773, Rush attests to the increasing compassion within the colonies towards the suffering of the slaves. He makes mention of the clergy publicly arguing that slavery is a violation of both \"the laws of nature\" and Christian belief.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Woods|first=John A.|last2=Rush|first2=Benjamin|last3=Sharp|first3=Granville|date=1967|title=The Correspondence of Benjamin Rush and Granville Sharp 1773\u20141809|journal=Journal of American Studies|volume=1|issue=1|pages=1\u201338|jstor=27552761|doi=10.1017/S0021875800005946}}</ref> This detail is noteworthy because Sharp was of the belief that laws should follow both \"the laws of nature\" and that which is given in Judeo-Christian scripture.<ref name=\":2\" /> Another letter, written February 21, 1774, has Sharp providing Rush with several pamphlets, written by himself and his brothers William and James, to be shared with friends and eventually to Lord Dartmouth. Many similar exchanges of pamphlets occur throughout their correspondence, which allowed them to inspire one another and refine their arguments against slavery. The final letter of their correspondence was written June 20, 1809, four years prior to the death of both figures in 1813.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Abolition===\nWhen Sharp heard that the [[Slave Trade Act 1807|Act of Abolition]] had at last been passed by both Houses of Parliament and given Royal Assent on 25 March 1807, he fell to his knees and offered a prayer of thanksgiving.  He was now 71, and had outlived almost all of the allies and opponents of his early campaigns. He was regarded as the grand old man of the abolition struggle, and although a driving force in its early days, his place had later been taken by others such as [[Thomas Clarkson]], [[William Wilberforce]] and the [[Clapham Sect]]. Sharp, however, did not see the final abolition as he died on 6 July 1813.<ref name=Sheppard/>\n\n==The Province of Freedom==\n[[File:Province of Freedom.jpg|thumb|200px|right|View from Granville Town looking north to Bullom Shore from ''Voyages to the River Sierra Leone'' by John Matthews, 1788]]\n\nAlthough no reliable figures exist, it is thought that in the early 1780s there were around 15,000 black people in Britain, most of them without employment. Ideas were formulated for a settlement in Africa where they could return \"home\". [[Henry Smeathman]], a plant collector and [[entomologist]] who had visited Sierra Leone, propounded to the [[Committee for the Relief of the Black Poor]] that the country would be an excellent location.  Worried black people came to see Sharp, concerned that they might be re-enslaved in such a place.<ref>Michael Siva, ''Why did Black Londoners not join the Sierra Leone Resettlement Scheme 1783-1815?'' (London: Open University, 2014), p. 20-4.</ref><ref>Simon Schama, ''Rough Crossings'' (London: BBC Books, 2005), pp. 183-5.</ref>\n\nSharp took to the idea with alacrity: he saw it as a perfect opportunity to create a new model society from scratch. He drew up plans and regulations, and persuaded the Treasury to finance the ships and pay \u00a312 a head to each embarking settler. He named the new, egalitarian, peaceful Christian society-to-be \"[[Cline Town, Sierra Leone|The Province of Freedom]]\".<ref>Simon Schama, ''Rough Crossings'' (London: BBC Books, 2005), pp. 185-194</ref>\n\nThe utopian ideal quickly went sour in the face of tremendous logistical difficulties; fire broke out even before the ships had left London. Sharp's friend, [[Olaudah Equiano]], highlighted corruption in the process of stocking the ships, and was dismissed as a result; 411 people sailed for Africa, including some 60 white women without Sharp's knowledge, married to the male settlers. It is unclear how many were previously betrothed and how many married in preparation for the journey; traditionally these women have been characterized as prostitutes from Deptford. However, historians have since dismissed that description as false.<ref name=\"Simon Schama 2005 pp. 200-16\">Simon Schama, ''Rough Crossings'' (London: BBC Books, 2005), pp. 200-16.</ref><ref>Michael Siva, ''Why did Black Londoners not join the Sierra Leone Resettlement Scheme 1783-1815?'' (London: Open University, 2014), p. 28-33, 40-3.</ref> The settlers arrived in May 1787, at the onset of the five-month rainy season, and a settlement of sorts was built, named Granville Town. The commander of the naval escort that had brought the settlers concluded that they were unfit for the complex challenge of founding a new settlement in a potentially hostile environment.<ref name=\"Simon Schama 2005 pp. 200-16\"/> One of the settlers whom Granville had rescued from a slave ship left the settlement to work in the slave trade, much to Sharp's despair. By the end of 1788 Sharp had poured \u00a31,735 18s 8d of his own money into the settlement. In 1789 Granville Town was burned to the ground by a local [[Temne people|Temne]] chief; this may have been in retaliation for the burning of a Temne by a slave-trader.<ref name=Sheppard/>\n\nThrough The Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade, in 1790 Granville came into contact with [[Thomas Peters (black leader)|Thomas Peters]], a former American slave who fought with the British during revolution in return for freedom. Sharp was instrumental in helping Peters to establish [[Freetown]], Sierra Leone. Sharp is considered to be one of the founders of Sierra Leone alongside Thomas Peters and the Clarkson brothers ([[Thomas Clarkson]] and [[John Clarkson (abolitionist)|John Clarkson]]).\n\n==Other activism==\n[[File:Granville Sharp medallion.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A white glass medallion of Granville Sharp by [[Catherine Andras]], made on 2 April 1809.]]\n\nSharp ardently sympathized with the revolt of the [[American Revolution|American colonists]]. He believed in peace in America, but he also believed they were entitled to \"Equitable Representation\", an idea repeated in the famous phrase \"[[No taxation without representation]]\". When he realised his job in the Ordnance Office meant sending equipment to British forces fighting the colonists, he took leave of absence. As the war continued, he wrote to his employers \"I cannot return to my ordnance duty whilst a bloody war is carried on, unjustly, against my fellow-subjects.\" Eventually in 1776 he resigned, never to have paid employment again and supported willingly by his brothers, who were happy to see him dedicate his time to his various causes.<ref name=Sheppard/>\n\nSharp also advocated parliamentary reform and the legislative independence of [[Ireland]], and agitated against the [[impressment]] of sailors for the [[Royal Navy|Navy]]. It was through his efforts that bishops for the [[United States|United States of America]] were consecrated by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in 1787.  He also argued for the reform of Parliament based on [[Magna Carta]] and to back this up he devised the doctrine of accumulative authority. This doctrine stated that because almost innumerable parliaments had approved Magna Carta it would take the same number of Parliaments to repeal it. Like many others, Sharp accepted the supremacy of Parliament as an institution, but did not believe that this power was without restraint, and thought that Parliament could not repeal Magna Carta.\n\nSharp was also one of the founders and the first President of the British and Foreign Bible Society and of the Society for the Conversion of the Jews.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Classical grammarian==\nOne of Granville's letters written in 1778 (published in 1798), propounded what has come to be known as '''The Granville Sharp Rule''' (in actuality only the first of six principles that Sharp articulated involving the Greek article):\n\n:\u201cWhen the copulative ''kai'' connects two [[noun]]s of the same [[case (linguistics)|case]], if the article ''ho'', or any of its cases, precedes the first of the said nouns or participles, and is not repeated before the second noun or participle, the latter always relates to the same person that is expressed or described by the first noun or participle ...\u201d<ref name=Sharp>{{cite book | last = Sharp | first =  Granville | authorlink = | title = Remarks on the Uses of the Definitive Article in the Greek Text of the New Testament, Containing Many New Proofs of the Divinity of Christ, from Passages Which Are Wrongly Translated in the Common English Version | publisher = | year = 1798| location = London | page = 8 | url = http://www.theologue.org/downloads/sharp.pdf | isbn = }}</ref>\n\nThis rule, if true, has a profound bearing on Unitarian doctrine, which led to a \u2018celebrated controversy\u2019, in which many leading divines took part, including [[Christopher Wordsworth]].\n\nFor a full discussion of Sharp's Rule and its application to passages in the New Testament which teach the deity of Christ, see the series \"The Greek Article and the Doctrine of Christ's Deity,\" by Clifford Kuehne. This series appeared in several issues of the ''Journal of Theology'' of the Church of the Lutheran Confession, and it is available for reading at the following web site: http://jot.clclutheran.org/christs-deity/ This series also discusses the application of Colwell's Rule to John 1:1.\n\nDaniel B. Wallace says about Sharp:\n\n:\u201cHis strong belief in Christ\u2019s deity led him to study the Scriptures in the original in order to defend more ably that precious truth ... As he studied the Scriptures in the original, he noticed a certain pattern, namely, when the construction article-noun-\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9-noun involved personal nouns which were singular and not proper names, they always referred to the same person. He noticed further that this rule applied in several texts to the deity of Jesus Christ.\u201d<ref name=Wallace1983>{{cite journal | last = Wallace | first = Daniel B. | authorlink = | title = The Semantic Range of the Article-Noun-Kai'-Noun Plural Construction in the New Testament | journal = [[Grace Theological Journal]] | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | page = 61 | year = 1983 | url = http://faculty.gordon.edu/hu/bi/ted_hildebrandt/New_Testament_Greek/Text/Wallace-ArticleNoun-GTJ.pdf | doi =  | accessdate = 2008-12-19}}</ref>\n\nBut Wallace claims that this rule is often too broadly applied. \u201cSharp\u2019s rule Number 1\u201d does not always work with plural forms of personal titles. Instead, a phrase that follows the form article-noun-\u201cand\u201d-noun, when the nouns involved are plurals, can involve two entirely distinct groups, two overlapping groups, two groups of which is one a subset of the other, or two identical groups.<ref>Wallace 1983, pp. 72\u201378</ref> In other words, the rule is of very specific and limited application.\n\nOf Granville Sharp's most successful critic, Calvin Winstanley, Wallace says:\n\n:\"Winstanley conceded 'There are, you say, no exceptions, in the New Testament, to your rule; that is, I suppose, unless these particular texts [i.e. the ones Sharp used to adduce Christ's deity] be such ... it is nothing surprising to find all these particular texts in question appearing as the exceptions to your rule, and the sole exceptions ... in the New Testament'<ref name=Winstanley>{{cite book | last = Winstanley | first =  Calvin | authorlink = | title = A Vindication of Certain Passages in the Common English Version of the New Testament: Addressed to Granville Sharp, Esq | publisher = | year = 1819|edition=2nd | location =  | pages = 39\u201340 | url = | isbn = }}</ref> \u2013 an obvious concession that he could find no exceptions save for the ones he supposed exist in the christologically pregnant texts.\"<ref name=Wallace1997>{{cite book | last = Wallace | first =  Daniel B. | authorlink = | title = Greek Grammar Beyond the Basics: An Exegetical Syntax of the New Testament | publisher = | year = 1997 | location =  | page = 273, n.50 | url = | isbn = }}</ref>\n\nWhat Wallace neglects by use of ellipses (...) is the flow of Winstanley's argument as well as the character of his theology.<ref>Winstanley ''passim''</ref>  Winstanley's quote argued that one could not apply Sharp's rule to the possible exceptions unless it could be shown that extra-biblical literature also followed Sharp's rule. Through multiple examples Winstanley showed that in classical Greek and in patristic Greek \u2013 all the literature surrounding the New Testament, the rule simply did not apply consistently. Wallace's quote comes from the end of Winstanley's argument in which he clearly is not conceding the point. To complete Winstanley's argument:\n\n:\"There are, you say, no exceptions, in the New Testament, to your rule; that is, I suppose, unless these particular texts be such; which you think utterly improbable.  You would argue, then, that if these texts were exceptions, there would be more.  I do not perceive any great weight in this hypothetical reasoning.  But, however plausible it may appear, the reply is at hand.  There are no other words so likely to yield exceptions; because there are no other words, between which the insertion of the copulative, would effect so remarkable a deviation from the established form of constructing them to express one person; and of course, would so pointedly suggest a difference of signification.\"<ref>Winstanley, p. 39</ref>\n\nWinstanley was Trinitarian, but cautioned that a rule that held true only in the New Testament in all but the disputed cases was too flimsy a ground on which to try to prove the divinity of Christ to the Socinians (Unitarians). Instead he said, \"[I think] there are much more cogent arguments in reserve, when [Sharp's] rule of interpretation shall be abandoned.\"<ref>Winstanley, p. 42</ref> His biggest criticisms of Sharp's rule rest in the fact that 1) the early church fathers do not follow it and 2) the early church father's never invoked this rule to prove the divinity of Christ (though it would have been an obvious tool against such heresy).  He concludes, \"Hence it may be presumed that the doctrine then rested on other grounds.\"<ref>Winstanley, p. 43</ref>\n\nHowever, just because Wallace exaggerates Winstanley's concession does not mean that he has no evidence to refute Winstanley. Wallace argues that, for various reasons, the only two passages from Granville's eight that truly follow Sharp's rule (for textual reasons, among others) are Titus 2:13 and 2 Peter 1:1.<ref name=\"Wallace\">[http://bible.org/article/sharp-redivivus-reexamination-granville-sharp-rule ''Sharp Redivivus'' by Wallace]</ref> Wallace interacts in depth with Winstanley's critiques of Sharp and shows from grammatical, textual, linguistic, and Patristic evidence that Sharp's rule is truly valid across Classical, Biblical, Papyrological, and Patristic Greek \u2013 with some slight modification to the rules.<ref name=\"Wallace\"/> Here is how Wallace restates the issue:\n\n\"In native Greek constructions (i.e., not translation Greek), when a single article modifies two substantives connected by \u03ba\u03b1\u03af (thus, article-substantive-\u03ba\u03b1\u03af-substantive), when both substantives are (1) singular (both grammatically and semantically), (2) personal, (3) and common nouns (not proper names or ordinals), they have the same referent.\"<ref name=\"Wallace\"/><ref>This essay by Wallace is a summary of his dissertation and he has developed it further by publishing the argument as a book: ''Granville Sharp's Canon and its Kin''</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Granville Sharp's tomb.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Granville Sharp's tomb at [[All Saints Church, Fulham|All Saints', Fulham]], after restoration.]]\n\n[[File:Granville Sharp's tomb inscription.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Inscription on Granville Sharp's tomb.]]\n\nAfter his death on 6 July 1813, Granville Sharp was buried at [[All Saints Church, Fulham|All Saints' Church, Fulham]], beside his brother [[William Sharp (surgeon)|William Sharp]] and sister Elizabeth Prouse.

The original story was by [[Hiroyuki Kawasaki]]. It was directed by [[Tsutomu Yabuki]] and produced by [[Studio Hibari]] and [[Trinet Entertainment]].\n\n==Overview==\nThe [[protagonist]] of the series, Amano Sakogami, is a happy but unlucky girl. She has a dream about being attacked by a woman in a purple kimono. She is rescued by a boy in this dream, who causes her to forget the dream. It is only when she is recruited by a club at her school that she remembers. This club is called the ''Kaiun Kenkyukai'' (Better Fortune Research Organization), a cover for the Happy Seven, seven girls who each have a different power of the Shichifukujin, the [[Seven Lucky Gods]]. There are two other female members of the club, a dog-girl and a girl with pigtails and glasses. Amano recognizes the lone male member of the club as the boy who rescued her in her dreams. When she realizes this, she appoints herself their manager, hoping that this will allow her to get closer to him. She realizes that the student council president is Happy Seven's adversary, working with the woman in the purple kimono she saw in her dream. He is one of the reasons that Magatsugami, monsters that feed on negative emotions, are being released onto the world. It is the Happy Seven's job to fight them and find people with incredibly bad luck (such as Amano) and help them improve their fortune, through praying for their problems to be solved at a stone in a forest. By praying like this, they rid the person of the Magatsugami feeding on their sadness and therefore causing their misfortune. Normally, the memory of the person with the Magatsugami would be erased so that the identities of the Seven are not revealed, but this does not work for Amano. In episode 10, Amano and her childhood friends Nene and Mimi transform into Lucky Three (three transforming [[magical girls]] similar to the Happy Seven) but Mimi and Nene's memories are erased by Kikunosuke.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Better Fortune Research Organization===\n*'''Amano Sakogami (voiced by [[Yuuna Inamura]]):''' The [[protagonist]] of the story who had been possessed by a Magatsugami from the time when she was very young until she met the Better Fortune Research Organization who used their powers to defeat it. The Magatsugami gave her extremely bad luck, causing things to happen to her ranging from tripping and falling down staircases or stepping on and break her brand-new cell phone to having heavy objects fall on her or getting hit by a volleyball in gym class. After the Magatsugami was defeated, Amano's luck became far better but her clumsiness remained. She has a crush on Kikunosuke, but does not know the rule that the other female members of the club have: even though they all like him, they are not allowed to go out with him. After discovering the secret of the club, she asks to join and is unanimously rejected by all of the female members, but when she offers to be the manager Kikunosuke agrees while all of the others were discussing the idea.She is one of the Lucky Three and the leader.\n*'''Kikunosuke Kagawa (voiced by [[Jun Fukuyama]]):''' The only male club member and Amano's upperclassman who she has a crush on. He can transform into one of the Seven, but his god is not readily revealed. When Amano asks for details about the Happy Seven and he is explaining how each member represents a god, he only has the chance to tell her that his role was more complicated than the others. His eyes always appear to be closed except for when he transforms.\n*'''Kuriya Kuroda (voiced by [[Houko Kuwashima]]):''' She represents [[Daikoku-ten]] and carries a hammer as a weapon. She seems to be some sort of leader among the Happy Seven.\n*'''Tamon Kitayama (voiced by [[Chiemi Chiba]]):''' Tamon represents [[Vai\u015brava\u1e47a#In Japan|Bishamon-ten]], and her power is ''Jarei-mekkyaku raiko sange''. She is one of the Happy Seven that undertake a major personality change after the appearance shift, going from shy, and timid to slightly aggressive and sure of her power.\n*'''Sarasugawa Kiku (voiced by [[Mai Nakahara]]):''' Also said as Okiku. She represents [[Benzaiten|Benzai-ten]]. She is outgoing and cocky about her talents, but she can easily back her boasts up. She constantly calls Amano \"Ribbon Girl\" and puts on the outside appearance that she doesn't like her.\n*'''Mahiru Oki (voiced by [[Yu Kobayashi]]):''' Mahiru represents [[Ebisu (mythology)|Ebisu]] and tends to carry around a fish with her. Even her weapon when she transforms is something like a fishing pole with a fish on the end. She is the only university student in the club.\n*'''Miku Munakata (voiced by [[Yuuko Sumitomo]]):''' She represents [[Budai|Hotei-sama]] and is a doctor. She is the eldest member of the club (she works as the school's nurse) and has the power to predict the future when she transforms and appears to have some minor premonitions when not transformed as seen in Episode 9.\n*'''Mina and Nami Kotobuki (voiced by [[Omi Minami]]):''' Mina and Nami are twins and the youngest members of the club, as the only elementary students. They have a tendency to fall over and go to sleep if they expend even the smallest amount of energy, which they seem to lack, except when they transform in which case they are full of energy. Mina represents [[Fukurokuju]] and Nami represents [[Juroujin]] (twin gods of luck and fortune based on [[Fu Lu Shou#Shou star|Shou]], the god of the [[Argo Navis|South Pole Star]] in Taoist astrology). Because they represent a binary god, they are almost the same person. Details about the twins' relationship are in episode 6.\n*'''Kuan Kitayama (voiced by [[Eri Sendai]]):''' She is one of the few club members who is not a part of the Happy Seven and is Tamon's younger sister. She is shown as being good with computers and machinery, and helps the Happy Seven by using her computer to get information on Magatsugami and using various gizmos to stun, trap, or otherwise hinder them.\n*'''Shouko Shouda (voiced by [[Tomoko Kaneda]]):''' Also called Shoujou, she has dog ears and can transform into a small dog. She is one of the members who cannot transform, but acts as a sort of familiar for the others. Every time some one refers to her as a dog, she sharply denies being one, which is often disproved by one of the members issuing a command such as \"shake\" and her automatically complying.\n\n===Enemies===\n*'''Kokuanten (Japanese voiced by [[Kikuko Inoue]], English voiced by [[Cindy Robinson]]) :''' An Evil Goddess whose power was some how taken away, her goal is to use the \"Red Star\" to return herself to full strength, she also has some measure of control over the Magatsugami and \"Tainted Ones.\"\n*'''Tomoya Kuki (Voiced by [[Kumi Sakuma]]):''' He is the student council president at the school and appears henchman of sorts to Kokuanten, but is later revealed to be using her for his own end.\n*'''Magatsugami:''' Monsters that possess people and cause misfortune, then feeding on their unhappiness. Kokuanten and Tomoya manipulate them so that they can be used against the Happy Seven, whose job it is to defeat them. When they are killed, they turn into good luck charms.\n\n===Supporting Characters===\n*'''Mimi Masuko (voiced by [[Nanako Inoue]]):''' She is Amano and Nene's childhood friend and a member of Lucky Three representing the Ears, though her memory was erased after she transformed.\n*'''Nene Tokuda (voiced by [[Erika Nakai]]):''' Amano and Mimi's childhood friend and a member of Lucky Three representing the Eyes, though she, like Mimi, had her memory of the incident erased.\n*'''Chazawa:''' Teacher who isn't married and dreams of it. But eventually marries one of his former students.\n*'''Kaoru Sajime:''' A student at the school who dressed like a boy because she was possessed by a Magatsugami. The club solved her problem after discovering that her reason for being unhappy was her parent's disapproval of her hobby, which is building models, because it isn't \"feminine\". After defeating the Magatsugami, her parents saw reason and allowed her to return to the plastic model club, which they had forced her to quit along with her hobby. She is the only girl in that club and the male members have a rule similar to the Better Fortune Research Organization's, which only the male members know about, which is that none of them are allowed to date her.\n*'''Tomomi Sasaki (Saki Fujita):''' Appeared in episode 10. A friend of Mimi's that had a confusing life and didn't believe in anything.\n\n==Episode list==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"98%\"\n! width=\"2%\" | No. !! Title !!

While the senior members of the group are away, Amano's home class teacher asks for help with his love life, and is revealed to be possessed. After not being able to remove the monster from praying at the prayer stone, due to his lack of belief, the group head to his home, and attempt to make him as happy as possible.

The original story was by [[Hiroyuki Kawasaki]]. It was directed by [[Tsutomu Yabuki]] and produced by [[Studio Hibari]] and [[Trinet Entertainment]].\n\n==Overview==\nThe [[protagonist]] of the series, Amano Sakogami, is a happy but unlucky girl. She has a dream about being attacked by a woman in a purple kimono. She is rescued by a boy in this dream, who causes her to forget the dream. It is only when she is recruited by a club at her school that she remembers. This club is called the ''Kaiun Kenkyukai'' (Better Fortune Research Organization), a cover for the Happy Seven, seven girls who each have a different power of the Shichifukujin, the [[Seven Lucky Gods]]. There are two other female members of the club, a dog-girl and a girl with pigtails and glasses. Amano recognizes the lone male member of the club as the boy who rescued her in her dreams. When she realizes this, she appoints herself their manager, hoping that this will allow her to get closer to him. She realizes that the student council president is Happy Seven's adversary, working with the woman in the purple kimono she saw in her dream. He is one of the reasons that Magatsugami, monsters that feed on negative emotions, are being released onto the world. It is the Happy Seven's job to fight them and find people with incredibly bad luck (such as Amano) and help them improve their fortune, through praying for their problems to be solved at a stone in a forest. By praying like this, they rid the person of the Magatsugami feeding on their sadness and therefore causing their misfortune. Normally, the memory of the person with the Magatsugami would be erased so that the identities of the Seven are not revealed, but this does not work for Amano. In episode 10, Amano and her childhood friends Nene and Mimi transform into Lucky Three (three transforming [[magical girls]] similar to the Happy Seven) but Mimi and Nene's memories are erased by Kikunosuke.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Better Fortune Research Organization===\n*'''Amano Sakogami (voiced by [[Yuuna Inamura]]):''' The [[protagonist]] of the story who had been possessed by a Magatsugami from the time when she was very young until she met the Better Fortune Research Organization who used their powers to defeat it. The Magatsugami gave her extremely bad luck, causing things to happen to her ranging from tripping and falling down staircases or stepping on and break her brand-new cell phone to having heavy objects fall on her or getting hit by a volleyball in gym class. After the Magatsugami was defeated, Amano's luck became far better but her clumsiness remained. She has a crush on Kikunosuke, but does not know the rule that the other female members of the club have: even though they all like him, they are not allowed to go out with him. After discovering the secret of the club, she asks to join and is unanimously rejected by all of the female members, but when she offers to be the manager Kikunosuke agrees while all of the others were discussing the idea.She is one of the Lucky Three and the leader.\n*'''Kikunosuke Kagawa (voiced by [[Jun Fukuyama]]):''' The only male club member and Amano's upperclassman who she has a crush on. He can transform into one of the Seven, but his god is not readily revealed. When Amano asks for details about the Happy Seven and he is explaining how each member represents a god, he only has the chance to tell her that his role was more complicated than the others. His eyes always appear to be closed except for when he transforms.\n*'''Kuriya Kuroda (voiced by [[Houko Kuwashima]]):''' She represents [[Daikoku-ten]] and carries a hammer as a weapon. She seems to be some sort of leader among the Happy Seven.\n*'''Tamon Kitayama (voiced by [[Chiemi Chiba]]):''' Tamon represents [[Vai\u015brava\u1e47a#In Japan|Bishamon-ten]], and her power is ''Jarei-mekkyaku raiko sange''. She is one of the Happy Seven that undertake a major personality change after the appearance shift, going from shy, and timid to slightly aggressive and sure of her power.\n*'''Sarasugawa Kiku (voiced by [[Mai Nakahara]]):''' Also said as Okiku. She represents [[Benzaiten|Benzai-ten]]. She is outgoing and cocky about her talents, but she can easily back her boasts up. She constantly calls Amano \"Ribbon Girl\" and puts on the outside appearance that she doesn't like her.\n*'''Mahiru Oki (voiced by [[Yu Kobayashi]]):''' Mahiru represents [[Ebisu (mythology)|Ebisu]] and tends to carry around a fish with her. Even her weapon when she transforms is something like a fishing pole with a fish on the end. She is the only university student in the club.\n*'''Miku Munakata (voiced by [[Yuuko Sumitomo]]):''' She represents [[Budai|Hotei-sama]] and is a doctor. She is the eldest member of the club (she works as the school's nurse) and has the power to predict the future when she transforms and appears to have some minor premonitions when not transformed as seen in Episode 9.\n*'''Mina and Nami Kotobuki (voiced by [[Omi Minami]]):''' Mina and Nami are twins and the youngest members of the club, as the only elementary students. They have a tendency to fall over and go to sleep if they expend even the smallest amount of energy, which they seem to lack, except when they transform in which case they are full of energy. Mina represents [[Fukurokuju]] and Nami represents [[Juroujin]] (twin gods of luck and fortune based on [[Fu Lu Shou#Shou star|Shou]], the god of the [[Argo Navis|South Pole Star]] in Taoist astrology). Because they represent a binary god, they are almost the same person. Details about the twins' relationship are in episode 6.\n*'''Kuan Kitayama (voiced by [[Eri Sendai]]):''' She is one of the few club members who is not a part of the Happy Seven and is Tamon's younger sister. She is shown as being good with computers and machinery, and helps the Happy Seven by using her computer to get information on Magatsugami and using various gizmos to stun, trap, or otherwise hinder them.\n*'''Shouko Shouda (voiced by [[Tomoko Kaneda]]):''' Also called Shoujou, she has dog ears and can transform into a small dog. She is one of the members who cannot transform, but acts as a sort of familiar for the others. Every time some one refers to her as a dog, she sharply denies being one, which is often disproved by one of the members issuing a command such as \"shake\" and her automatically complying.\n\n===Enemies===\n*'''Kokuanten (Japanese voiced by [[Kikuko Inoue]], English voiced by [[Cindy Robinson]]) :''' An Evil Goddess whose power was some how taken away, her goal is to use the \"Red Star\" to return herself to full strength, she also has some measure of control over the Magatsugami and \"Tainted Ones.\"\n*'''Tomoya Kuki (Voiced by [[Kumi Sakuma]]):''' He is the student council president at the school and appears henchman of sorts to Kokuanten, but is later revealed to be using her for his own end.\n*'''Magatsugami:''' Monsters that possess people and cause misfortune, then feeding on their unhappiness. Kokuanten and Tomoya manipulate them so that they can be used against the Happy Seven, whose job it is to defeat them. When they are killed, they turn into good luck charms.\n\n===Supporting Characters===\n*'''Mimi Masuko (voiced by [[Nanako Inoue]]):''' She is Amano and Nene's childhood friend and a member of Lucky Three representing the Ears, though her memory was erased after she transformed.\n*'''Nene Tokuda (voiced by [[Erika Nakai]]):''' Amano and Mimi's childhood friend and a member of Lucky Three representing the Eyes, though she, like Mimi, had her memory of the incident erased.\n*'''Chazawa:''' Teacher who isn't married and dreams of it. But eventually gets married to one of his former students.\n*'''Kaoru Sajime:''' A student at the school who dressed like a boy because she was possessed by a Magatsugami. The club solved her problem after discovering that her reason for being unhappy was her parent's disapproval of her hobby, which is building models, because it isn't \"feminine\". After defeating the Magatsugami, her parents saw reason and allowed her to return to the plastic model club, which they had forced her to quit along with her hobby. She is the only girl in that club and the male members have a rule similar to the Better Fortune Research Organization's, which only the male members know about, which is that none of them are allowed to date her.\n*'''Tomomi Sasaki (Saki Fujita):''' Appeared in episode 10. A friend of Mimi's that had a confusing life and didn't believe in anything.\n\n==Episode list==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"98%\"\n! width=\"2%\" | No. !! Title !!

Bryan chose [[Kalisto (wrestler)|Kalisto]] and revealed that if Kalisto would win the title, the entire [[Cruiserweight (professional wrestling)|cruiserweight division]] would come to SmackDown.<ref name=\"Smackdown11082016\"/> On the November 14 episode of ''Raw'', Kendrick addressed the cruiserweights, and assured them that he would defeat Kalisto and keep the division on Raw.

Immediately before the match, SmackDown's captain Nikki Bella was attacked backstage, leaving her unable to compete, and team coach Natalya replaced her. Alicia [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinned]] Carmella after a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Scissors kick|scissors kick]] but was herself pinned by Alexa Bliss after \"[[Moonsault#Rounding moonsault|Twisted Bliss]]\". Naomi was [[Professional wrestling#Countout|counted out]] after Nia Jax attacked her. Natalya pinned Sasha with a [[Pin (professional wrestling)#Roll-up|roll-up]] but was pinned by Charlotte after a \"[[Professional wrestling attacks#Big boot|Queen's Boot]]\".

After the match, Charlotte attacked Bayley.<ref name=\"SSeries2016\"/>\n\nNext, The Miz defended the Intercontinental Championship against Sami Zayn. In the end, Zayn applied the [[Professional wrestling holds#Figure-four leglock|Figure-four leglock]] on Miz; as Miz was about to submit, Miz's [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] Maryse rang the ring bell. Zayn released the hold, thinking he had won, but Miz pinned him with a roll-up to retain the title.<ref name=\"SSeries2016\"/>\n\nAfter this, Team Raw (Raw Tag Team Champions The New Day (Big E and Kofi Kingston), Cesaro and Sheamus, Enzo Amore and Big Cass, The Shining Stars, and Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson) faced Team SmackDown (SmackDown Tag Team Champions Heath Slater and Rhyno, The Hype Bros, American Alpha, Breezango, and The Usos) in the tag team's Survivor Series match. Breezango, in their new fashion police attire, began by handing out tickets to everyone but were quickly eliminated by The New Day after the \"Midnight Hour\" (a \"[[cutter (professional wrestling)#Over the shoulder cutter|Big Ending]]\" and [[DDT (professional wrestling)#Diving DDT|diving DDT]] combination) on [[Fandango (wrestler)|Fandango]]. Immediately after, [[The Usos|Jimmy Uso]] executed a [[superkick]] on Kingston for a pinfall to eliminate New Day. Gallows and Anderson performed a \"[[Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers#Aided whiplash|Magic Killer]]\" on [[Zack Ryder]], eliminating The Hype Bros. American Alpha executed an [[Doomsday Device (wrestling)#Elevated diving bulldog|electric chair/diving bulldog combination]] on [[Primo (wrestler)|Primo]], eliminating The Shining Stars.

In the end, Cesaro applied the [[Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)|Sharpshooter]] on [[The Usos|Jey Uso]] while Sheamus performed a \"[[Professional wrestling attacks#Bicycle kick|Brogue Kick]]\" on Jimmy. Jey submitted, leaving Cesaro and Sheamus as the sole survivors for Team Raw.<ref name=\"SSeries2016\"/>\n\nIn the fourth match, The Brian Kendrick defended the WWE Cruiserweight Championship against Kalisto. Kendrick won by [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualification]] after Baron Corbin attacked Kendrick and then Kalisto, meaning Kendrick retained the title and the cruiserweight division remained on Raw. Backstage, Daniel Bryan confronted Corbin, who explained that he acted out of revenge on Kalisto to prevent more cruiserweights from appearing on SmackDown.<ref name=\"SSeries2016\"/>\n\nThe next match was the men's Survivor Series elimination match pitting Team Raw (WWE Universal Champion Kevin Owens, Chris Jericho, Braun Strowman, United States Champion Roman Reigns, and Seth Rollins) against Team SmackDown (WWE World Champion AJ Styles, Dean Ambrose, Bray Wyatt, Randy Orton, and Shane McMahon), who were accompanied by their mascot, James Ellsworth. Early in the match, Ambrose and Styles got into a heated argument. Ambrose attacked Styles, but was surprised by Strowman, who scored a pinfall after a [[Powerslam#front powerslam|running powerslam]]; Styles did not attempt to break the pin. Afterwards outside the ring, Orton executed an \"[[Cutter (professional wrestling)#Jumping cutter|RKO]]\" on Strowman onto a broadcast table. McMahon put Strowman through the table with a \"[[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Diving elbow drop|Leap of Faith]]\". Strowman was counted out when Ellsworth, who hid under the ring, held Strowman's legs to prevent him from returning to the ring. Strowman then chased Ellsworth up the entrance ramp and threw him off the stage. Later, Styles attempted the \"[[Facebuster#Belly-to-back inverted mat slam|Styles Clash]]\" on Jericho but Owens attacked Styles with the \"[[Chris Jericho#Alliance and feud with Kevin Owens (2016\u2013present)|List of Jericho]]\" and was disqualified. Jericho was distraught by his list being ripped apart. This allowed Orton to pin him after an \"RKO\". McMahon then attempted a \"[[Dropkick#Corner-to-corner missile dropkick|Coast to Coast]]\" but Reigns caught him mid-air with a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Spear|spear]]. The referee ruled the apparently unconscious Shane unfit to continue, eliminating him from the match. Ambrose, who had already been eliminated, returned to attack Styles and helped his former [[The Shield (professional wrestling)|Shield]] bretheren Rollins and Reigns perform a [[Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers#Aided powerbomb|triple powerbomb]] on Styles through a broadcast table. Rollins rolled Styles back in the ring for the pinfall. As Rollins attempted a Frog Splash on Wyatt, Orton quickly performed an \"RKO\" on Rollins, allowing Wyatt to score a pinfall. Reigns, Team Raw's final member, attempted a spear on Wyatt but hit Orton instead, who had pushed Wyatt out of the way. Wyatt then performed \"[[Facebuster#Swinging reverse STO|Sister Abigail]]\" on Reigns for the pin, leaving Wyatt and Orton as the survivors for Team SmackDown.<ref name=\"SSeries2016\"/>\n\n=== Main event ===\nIn the main event, Goldberg faced Brock Lesnar. Lesnar tackled Goldberg into the corner, only for Goldberg to shove Lesnar to the mat. As Lesnar stood up, Goldberg hit him with a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Spear|spear]].

Jericho blamed Owens for using \"The List of Jericho\" as a weapon, whereas Owens explained that he tried to save Jericho from being eliminated. The two finally agreed that Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins were at fault for Team Raw's loss. Rollins then demanded a title shot for Owens's WWE Universal Championship, as he was guaranteed a match for being part of Team Raw. Mick Foley then scheduled Owens to defend the title in the main event against Rollins in a no disqualification match, with Reigns and Jericho banned from ringside. The match ended when Jericho, disguised as a masked fan, interfered, allowing Owens to capitalize and retain the championship.<ref name=\"Raw11212016\"/> The following week, the friendship between Owens and Jericho was strained further, when Owens stated he did not need Jericho's help against the challenge of Roman Reigns.

After the match, Corbin attacked Kalisto with the ''End of Days'', while Miz's celebration was cut short by Dolph Ziggler with a Superkick.

Subsequently, the 2016 event, which was the thirtieth event in the Survivor Series chronology, featured several interpromotional matches to determine which was the better brand. \n\nOn the October 11 episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown Live]]'', SmackDown's Commissioner [[Shane McMahon]] and General Manager [[Daniel Bryan]] challenged Raw to three traditional Survivor Series elimination matches, involving each brand's best five male wrestlers, best five female wrestlers, and best five tag teams, respectively\u2014with the latter having a total of 10 wrestlers per team, but with the stipulation being that if one member of a tag team was eliminated, both members of that particular tag team were eliminated (this was the first Survivor Series since the [[Survivor Series (1988)|1988 event]] to have teams of five tag teams going against each other).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Clapp|first1=John|title=SmackDown LIVE issues huge Survivor Series challenge to Raw|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/2016/article/smackdown-live-issues-survivor-series-challenge-to-raw|publisher=WWE|date=October 11, 2016|accessdate=October 13, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Smackdown10112016\">{{cite web|last=Parks|first=Greg|title=10/11 WWE Smackdown LIVE \u2013 Parks's Complete, Real-Time Report|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/site/2016/10/11/1011-wwe-smackdown-live-parkss-ongoing-real-time-report/|work=Pro Wrestling Torch|date=October 11, 2016|accessdate=October 17, 2016}}</ref> The following week on ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'', Raw Commissioner [[Stephanie McMahon]] accepted the challenge to determine the better brand; this would be the genesis for the theme of the following years' events.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Clapp|first1=John|title=Raw accepts SmackDown LIVE's Survivor Series challenge|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/2016/article/raw-accepts-smackdown-live-survivor-series-challenge|work=WWE|accessdate=October 17, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Smackdown10182016\">{{cite web|last=Parks|first=Greg|title=10/18 WWE Smackdown LIVE \u2013 Parks's Ongoing, Real-Time Report|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/site/2016/10/18/1018-wwe-smackdown-live-parkss-ongoing-real-time-report-2/|work=Pro Wrestling Torch|date=October 18, 2016|accessdate=October 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Storylines ===\n<!-- DO NOT ADD WEEK-BY-WEEK EVENTS, RUMORS OR SPECULATION.

Immediately before the match, SmackDown's captain Nikki Bella was attacked backstage, leaving her unable to compete, and team coach Natalya replaced her. Alicia [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinned]] Carmella after a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Scissors kick|scissors kick]] but was herself pinned by Alexa Bliss after \"[[Moonsault#Rounding moonsault|Twisted Bliss]]\". Naomi was [[Professional wrestling#Countout|counted out]] after Nia Jax attacked her. Natalya pinned Sasha with a [[Pin (professional wrestling)#Roll-up|roll-up]] but was pinned by Charlotte after a \"[[Professional wrestling attacks#Big boot|Queen's Boot]]\". Becky Lynch forced Nia Jax [[Professional wrestling#Submission|submit]] to the \"[[Professional wrestling holds#Seated fujiwara armbar|Dis-arm-her]]\", eliminating Jax. Charlotte pinned Alexa after a \"Queen's Boot\". Bayley pinned Lynch after a \"[[Suplex#Belly-to-belly suplex|Bayley-to-Belly Suplex]]\", leaving Bayley and Charlotte as the survivors for Team Raw. After the match, Charlotte attacked Bayley.<ref name=\"SSeries2016\"/>\n\nNext, The Miz defended the Intercontinental Championship against Sami Zayn. In the end, Zayn applied the [[Professional wrestling holds#Figure-four leglock|Figure-four leglock]] on Miz; as Miz was about to submit, Miz's [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] Maryse rang the ring bell. Zayn released the hold, thinking he had won, but Miz pinned him with a roll-up to retain the title.<ref name=\"SSeries2016\"/>\n\nAfter this, Team Raw (Raw Tag Team Champions The New Day (Big E and Kofi Kingston), Cesaro and Sheamus, Enzo Amore and Big Cass, The Shining Stars, and Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson) faced Team SmackDown (SmackDown Tag Team Champions Heath Slater and Rhyno, The Hype Bros, American Alpha, Breezango, and The Usos) in the tag team's Survivor Series match. Breezango, in their new fashion police attire, began by handing out tickets to everyone but were quickly eliminated by The New Day after the \"Midnight Hour\" (a \"[[cutter (professional wrestling)#Over the shoulder cutter|Big Ending]]\" and [[DDT (professional wrestling)#Diving DDT|diving DDT]] combination) on [[Fandango (wrestler)|Fandango]]. Immediately after, [[The Usos|Jimmy Uso]] executed a [[superkick]] on Kingston for a pinfall to eliminate New Day. Gallows and Anderson performed a \"[[Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers#Aided whiplash|Magic Killer]]\" on [[Zack Ryder]], eliminating The Hype Bros. American Alpha executed an [[Doomsday Device (wrestling)#Elevated diving bulldog|electric chair/diving bulldog combination]] on [[Primo (wrestler)|Primo]], eliminating The Shining Stars. Gallows and Anderson eliminated American Alpha with a \"Magic Killer\" on [[Jason Jordan]], but were eliminated by Rhyno and Heath Slater after Rhyno performed a \"[[Professional wrestling attacks#striking spear|Gore]]\" on Gallows. [[Enzo Amore]] [[Enzo and Cass|and]] [[Big Cass]] then performed a \"[[Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers#Rocket Launcher|Bada Boom Shakalaka]]\" on Rhyno, eliminating him and Heath Slater. The Usos eliminated Enzo and Cass after a \"[[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Splash|Samoan Splash]]\" on Enzo. In the end, Cesaro applied the [[Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)|Sharpshooter]] on [[The Usos|Jey Uso]] while Sheamus performed a \"[[Professional wrestling attacks#Bicycle kick|Brogue Kick]]\" on Jimmy. Jey submitted, leaving Cesaro and Sheamus as the sole survivors for Team Raw.<ref name=\"SSeries2016\"/>\n\nIn the fourth match, The Brian Kendrick defended the WWE Cruiserweight Championship against Kalisto. Kendrick won by [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualification]] after Baron Corbin attacked Kendrick and then Kalisto, meaning Kendrick retained the title and the cruiserweight division remained on Raw. Backstage, Daniel Bryan confronted Corbin, who explained that he acted out of revenge on Kalisto to prevent more cruiserweights from appearing on SmackDown.<ref name=\"SSeries2016\"/>\n\nThe next match was the men's Survivor Series elimination match pitting Team Raw (WWE Universal Champion Kevin Owens, Chris Jericho, Braun Strowman, United States Champion Roman Reigns, and Seth Rollins) against Team SmackDown (WWE World Champion AJ Styles, Dean Ambrose, Bray Wyatt, Randy Orton, and Shane McMahon), who were accompanied by their mascot, James Ellsworth. Early in the match, Ambrose and Styles got into a heated argument. Ambrose attacked Styles, but was surprised by Strowman, who scored a pinfall after a [[Powerslam#front powerslam|running powerslam]]; Styles did not attempt to break the pin. Afterwards outside the ring, Orton executed an \"[[Cutter (professional wrestling)#Jumping cutter|RKO]]\" on Strowman onto a broadcast table. McMahon put Strowman through the table with a \"[[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Diving elbow drop|Leap of Faith]]\". Strowman was counted out when Ellsworth, who hid under the ring, held Strowman's legs to prevent him from returning to the ring. Strowman then chased Ellsworth up the entrance ramp and threw him off the stage. Later, Styles attempted the \"[[Facebuster#Belly-to-back inverted mat slam|Styles Clash]]\" on Jericho but Owens attacked Styles with the \"[[Chris Jericho#Alliance and feud with Kevin Owens (2016\u2013present)|List of Jericho]]\" and was disqualified. Jericho was distraught by his list being ripped apart. This allowed Orton to pin him after an \"RKO\". McMahon then attempted a \"[[Dropkick#Corner-to-corner missile dropkick|Coast to Coast]]\" but Reigns caught him mid-air with a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Spear|spear]]. The referee ruled the apparently unconscious Shane unfit to continue, eliminating him from the match. Ambrose, who had already been eliminated, returned to attack Styles and helped his former [[The Shield (professional wrestling)|Shield]] bretheren Rollins and Reigns perform a [[Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers#Aided powerbomb|triple powerbomb]] on Styles through a broadcast table. Rollins rolled Styles back in the ring for the pinfall. As Rollins attempted a Frog Splash on Wyatt, Orton quickly performed an \"RKO\" on Rollins, allowing Wyatt to score a pinfall. Reigns, Team Raw's final member, attempted a spear on Wyatt but hit Orton instead, who had pushed Wyatt out of the way. Wyatt then performed \"[[Facebuster#Swinging reverse STO|Sister Abigail]]\" on Reigns for the pin, leaving Wyatt and Orton as the survivors for Team SmackDown.<ref name=\"SSeries2016\"/>\n\n=== Main event ===\nIn the main event, Goldberg faced Brock Lesnar. Lesnar tackled Goldberg into the corner, only for Goldberg to shove Lesnar to the mat. As Lesnar stood up, Goldberg hit him with a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Spear|spear]]. Goldberg then executed another spear and a \"[[Powerslam#Vertical suplex powerslam|Jackhammer]]\" on Lesnar to win the match.<ref name=\"SSeries2016\"/>\n\n== Aftermath ==\n<!-- DO NOT ADD WEEK-BY-WEEK EVENTS, RUMORS OR SPECULATION.

Strowman brutalized Zayn until he was no longer able to compete and Mick Foley stopped the match, giving the win to Strowman.<ref name=\"Raw11212016\"/>\n\nAfter winning the elimination tag team match for Raw, Cesaro and Sheamus were granted a title shot for the Raw Tag Team Championship against The New Day the next night on ''Raw''. However, The New Day retained their championship.<ref name=\"Raw11212016\"/>\n\nOn the ''Highlight Reel'' during ''Raw'', Chris Jericho got into a heated argument with his best friend Kevin Owens. Jericho blamed Owens for using \"The List of Jericho\" as a weapon, whereas Owens explained that he tried to save Jericho from being eliminated. The two finally agreed that Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins were at fault for Team Raw's loss. Rollins then demanded a title shot for Owens's WWE Universal Championship, as he was guaranteed a match for being part of Team Raw. Mick Foley then scheduled Owens to defend the title in the main event against Rollins in a no disqualification match, with Reigns and Jericho banned from ringside. The match ended when Jericho, disguised as a masked fan, interfered, allowing Owens to capitalize and retain the championship.<ref name=\"Raw11212016\"/> The following week, the friendship between Owens and Jericho was strained further, when Owens stated he did not need Jericho's help against the challenge of Roman Reigns. Reigns then defeated Owens to earn a title match for the Universal Championship at [[Roadblock: End of the Line|Roadblock]].<ref name=\"Raw11282016\"/>\n\nAlso on ''Raw'', Charlotte justified her attack on Bayley, stating she no longer had to be her teammate after the match. She was then confronted by Sasha Banks, who invoked her championship rematch clause. Charlotte agreed, but insisted that the match would take place the following week, in her own hometown.<ref name=\"Raw11212016\"/> The next week, Sasha defeated Charlotte in a falls-count-anywhere match for her third Raw Women's Championship.<ref name=\"Raw11282016\"/>\n\nRich Swann defeated TJ Perkins and Noam Dar in a triple threat match to become the number one contender for the Cruiserweight Championship.<ref name=\"Raw11212016\"/> On the premiere of the cruiserweight's new exclusive show, ''[[WWE 205 Live|205 Live]]'', Swann defeated Kendrick for the championship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/site/2016/11/30/1129-wwe-205-live-review-2nd-report-premiere-episode-including-kendrick-vs-rich-swann-title-gallagher-vs-daivari-gulak-nese-vs-bollywood/|title=11/29 WWE \"205 Live\" Review (2nd Report): Premiere episode including Kendrick vs. Rich Swann for title, Gallagher vs. Daivari, Gulak & Nese vs. Bollywood|date=November 29, 2016|last=DeAngelo|first=Dominic|work=Pro Wrestling Torch|accessdate=November 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== SmackDown === \nThe following ''SmackDown'', Shane McMahon granted James Ellsworth a SmackDown contract for his dedication to the SmackDown brand. AJ Styles criticized this decision, arguing that Ellsworth should earn his contract in a ladder match. Ellsworth accepted the challenge, with both his new contract and a future opportunity at the WWE World Championship on the line. Dean Ambrose, who had been repeatedly sent out of the arena, returned during the match and helped Ellsworth defeat Styles.<ref name=\"Smackdown11222016\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/site/2016/11/22/kellers-wwe-smackdown-report-1122-full-coverage-fallout-survivor-series-shane-speech-miz-vs-kalisto-styles-vs-ellsworth-ladder-match/|title=KELLER\u2019S WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT 11/22: Full coverage of fallout from Survivor Series, Shane speech, Miz vs. Kalisto, Styles vs. Ellsworth ladder match|date=November 22, 2016|last=Keller|first=Wade|work=Pro Wrestling Torch|accessdate=November 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe Miz confronted Daniel Bryan about retaining the Intercontinental Championship and gloated over Kalisto not winning his match. Bryan responded that the way Miz won his match humiliated SmackDown and then scheduled Miz to immediately defend the title against Kalisto. Miz won the match when Corbin distracted Kalisto. After the match, Corbin attacked Kalisto with the ''End of Days'', while Miz's celebration was cut short by Dolph Ziggler with a Superkick. Bryan later scheduled The Miz to defend the Intercontinental Championship against Ziggler at [[TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs (2016)|TLC]] in a [[ladder match]].<ref name=\"Smackdown11222016\"/> As punishment for costing Kalisto two title opportunities and SmackDown the cruiserwight division, Bryan put Baron Corbin in a match against Kane.

After Natalya blamed Becky for her team's loss at Survivor Series, Shane blamed the entire team, especially the absence of Nikki Bella, and scheduled a match between Natalya and Becky. Becky won the match but was attacked afterwards by Alexa.<ref name=\"Smackdown11222016\"/> The following week, during the contract signing, Becky attacked Alexa but was eventually put through a table by Alexa. The match between the two was made a [[Professional wrestling match types#Tables match|tables match]].<ref name=\"Smackdown11292016\"/> Also backstage, Nikki Bella accused Carmella of being the one that attacked her at Survivor Series, which Carmella denied.
