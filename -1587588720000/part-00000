The region lies within the [[Tropoj\u00eb District]] and is part of a wider area between Albania and Kosovo that is historically known as ''Mal\u00ebsia e Gjakov\u00ebs'' (Highlands of [[Gjakova]]). Krasniqi stretches from the [[Valbon\u00eb (river)|Valbon\u00eb river]] in the north to [[Lake Fierza]] in the south and includes the town [[Bajram Curri (town)|Bajram Curri]].

According to this account, the first direct male ancestor of the Krasniqi was ''Kast\u00ebr Keqi'', son of a Catholic Albanian named ''Keq'' who fleeing from Ottoman conquest settled in the Slavic-speaking area that would become the historical [[Piperi (tribe)|Piperi]] tribal region in what is now Montenegro.

Formerly a marketing gimmick of Electronic Arts, in which they tried to imitate real-life sports networks by calling themselves the \"EA Sports Network\" (EASN) with pictures or endorsements with real commentators such as [[John Madden]], it soon grew up to become a sub-label on its own, releasing game series such as ''[[FIFA (video game series)|FIFA]]'', ''[[NHL (video game series)|NHL]]'', ''[[NBA Live (video game series)|NBA Live]]'' and ''[[Madden NFL]]''.\n\nMost games under this brand are developed by [[EA Vancouver]], the studio of Electronic Arts in [[Burnaby]], [[British Columbia]] as well as [[EA Tiburon]] in [[Maitland, Florida]]. The main rival to EA Sports is [[2K Sports]]. Notably, both companies compete over the realm of NBA games, with 2K releasing the ''[[NBA 2K]]'' series. [[Konami]] is its rival in association football games with their own series, ''[[Pro Evolution Soccer]]''.\n\nUnlike some other sports game companies, EA Sports has no special ties to a single platform, which means that all games are released for the bestselling active platforms, sometimes long after most of the other companies abandon them. For example, ''[[FIFA: Road to World Cup 98|FIFA 98]]'', ''[[Madden NFL 98]]'', ''[[NBA Live 98]]'', and ''[[NHL 98]]'' were released for the [[Sega Genesis]] and the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] throughout 1997; ''[[Madden NFL 2005]]'' and ''[[FIFA Football 2005|FIFA 2005]]'' had [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] releases in 2004 (''FIFA 2005'' and ''Madden NFL 2005'' were also the last two PlayStation titles to be released); and ''[[NCAA Football 08]]'' had an [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] release in 2007. ''[[Madden NFL 08]]'' also had [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and Nintendo [[GameCube]] releases in 2007, and was the final title released for the GameCube, with ''[[Madden NFL 09]]'' following as the final Xbox title. Additionally, ''[[NASCAR Thunder 2003]]'' and ''[[NASCAR Thunder 2004]]'' were released not only for the [[PlayStation 2]], but for the original [[PlayStation]] as well. EA Sports brand name is used to sponsor English [[Football League Two]] team [[Swindon Town F.C.]] from the 2009\u201310 season onward and the [[EA Sports Cup]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Daryl Holt, Gamelab 2018 (42322570894).jpg|thumb|left|250px|COO and VP Daryl Holt in 2018]]\n\n=== Exclusivity deals ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}\nIn 2002, EA purchased the license to [[NASCAR]] for six years, ending competition from [[Papyrus Design Group|Papyrus]] and [[Infogrames]]. They lost the NASCAR license in 2009 and the NASCAR license would be owned by [[Polyphony Digital]] for the [[Gran Turismo (series)|''Gran Turismo'' series]] starting with ''[[Gran Turismo 5]]'', and also [[Eutechnyx]] for [[NASCAR The Game (series)|''NASCAR The Game'' series]] until its inception in 2015.\n\nOn December 13, 2004, EA Sports signed an exclusive deal with the [[National Football League]] (NFL) and its Players' Union for five years. On February 12, 2008, EA Sports announced the extension of its exclusive deal until the [[2012 NFL season]].\n\nLess than a month after the NFL Exclusive deal, EA Sports signed a four-year exclusive deal with the [[Arena Football League (1987\u20132008)|Arena Football League]] (AFL).\n\nOn April 11, 2005, the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) and EA Sports signed a deal to grant EA Sports the sole rights to produce college football games for six years.\n\nEA lost the rights for [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) games to [[2K Sports]] in 2005, ending EA's MVP series; however, EA made [[NCAA Baseball]] games in 2006 and 2007 after losing the MLB license.\n\nIn January 2008, EA Sports decided not to renew their NCAA College Baseball license while they evaluate the status of their MVP game engine.\n\nIn 2005, EA Sports and [[ESPN]] signed a massive 15-year deal for ESPN to be integrated into EA Sports video games from [[2K Sports]] and [[Sega]]. EA's use of the ESPN license has steadily increased over the early life of the deal. EA's early usage of the ESPN license began with ESPN Radio and a sports ticker in titles like Madden NFL, NBA Live, Tiger Woods PGA Tour, and NCAA Baseball and Football. The ESPN integration now includes streaming podcasts, text articles (including content only available previously to ESPN Insider subscribers), and ESPN Motion video (including such programs as ''[[Pardon the Interruption]]'').\n\nIn 2012, EA signs a \"multi-year, multi-product\" partnership with the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]], taking over from [[THQ]].\n\nFollowing the release of ''[[Rory McIlroy PGA Tour]]'' in 2015, EA Sports announced that they will end its [[PGA Tour (video game series)|PGA Tour]] series after 25 years, with the said game was pulled from digital storefronts in May 2018. [[2K Sports]] announced that they will assumed their licensing agreement with the [[PGA Tour]] beginning with the release of ''[[The Golf Glub 2019 featuring the PGA Tour]]'' in 2018.\n\n=== PC games ===\nIn June 2009, EA Sports announced that for 2010, the games ''[[Madden NFL]]'', ''[[NCAA Football series|NCAA Football]]'', ''[[EA Sports NASCAR series|NASCAR]]'', ''[[NHL (video game series)|NHL]]'', ''[[NBA Live (video game series)|NBA Live]]'', and ''[[Tiger Woods PGA Tour]]'' would not be shipped for PC platforms.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=192214 |title=PC News: Peter Moore comes clean on EA SPORTS PC |magazine=[[ComputerAndVideoGames.com]] |access-date=May 29, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704130006/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=192214 |archive-date=July 4, 2008 |date=3 July 2008 |first=Andy |last=Robinson |publisher=[[Future Publishing Limited]]}}</ref> The NCAA Football series had not been released on the PC since 1998, The Tiger Woods series' last PC game was [[Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08]], the NASCAR series had not had a PC version since ''[[NASCAR SimRacing]]'' in 2005, and the last Madden series' to be released on PC was ''[[Madden NFL 08]]''. The NHL series' last PC game was ''[[NHL 09]]''.

Formerly a marketing gimmick of Electronic Arts, in which they tried to imitate real-life sports networks by calling themselves the \"EA Sports Network\" (EASN) with pictures or endorsements with real commentators such as [[John Madden]], it soon grew up to become a sub-label on its own, releasing game series such as ''[[FIFA (video game series)|FIFA]]'', ''[[NHL (video game series)|NHL]]'', ''[[NBA Live (video game series)|NBA Live]]'' and ''[[Madden NFL]]''.\n\nMost games under this brand are developed by [[EA Vancouver]], the studio of Electronic Arts in [[Burnaby]], [[British Columbia]] as well as [[EA Tiburon]] in [[Maitland, Florida]]. The main rival to EA Sports is [[2K Sports]]. Notably, both companies compete over the realm of NBA games, with 2K releasing the ''[[NBA 2K]]'' series. [[Konami]] is its rival in association football games with their own series, ''[[Pro Evolution Soccer]]''.\n\nUnlike some other sports game companies, EA Sports has no special ties to a single platform, which means that all games are released for the bestselling active platforms, sometimes long after most of the other companies abandon them. For example, ''[[FIFA: Road to World Cup 98|FIFA 98]]'', ''[[Madden NFL 98]]'', ''[[NBA Live 98]]'', and ''[[NHL 98]]'' were released for the [[Sega Genesis]] and the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] throughout 1997; ''[[Madden NFL 2005]]'' and ''[[FIFA Football 2005|FIFA 2005]]'' had [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] releases in 2004 (''FIFA 2005'' and ''Madden NFL 2005'' were also the last two PlayStation titles to be released); and ''[[NCAA Football 08]]'' had an [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] release in 2007. ''[[Madden NFL 08]]'' also had [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and Nintendo [[GameCube]] releases in 2007, and was the final title released for the GameCube, with ''[[Madden NFL 09]]'' following as the final Xbox title. Additionally, ''[[NASCAR Thunder 2003]]'' and ''[[NASCAR Thunder 2004]]'' were released not only for the [[PlayStation 2]], but for the original [[PlayStation]] as well. EA Sports brand name is used to sponsor English [[Football League Two]] team [[Swindon Town F.C.]] from the 2009\u201310 season onward and the [[EA Sports Cup]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Daryl Holt, Gamelab 2018 (42322570894).jpg|thumb|left|250px|COO and VP Daryl Holt in 2018]]\n\n=== Exclusivity deals ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}\nIn 2002, EA purchased the license to [[NASCAR]] for six years, ending competition from [[Papyrus Design Group|Papyrus]] and [[Infogrames]]. They lost the NASCAR license in 2009 and the NASCAR license would be owned by [[Polyphony Digital]] for the [[Gran Turismo (series)|''Gran Turismo'' series]] starting with ''[[Gran Turismo 5]]'', and also [[Eutechnyx]] for [[NASCAR The Game (series)|''NASCAR The Game'' series]] until its inception in 2015.\n\nOn December 13, 2004, EA Sports signed an exclusive deal with the [[National Football League]] (NFL) and its Players' Union for five years. On February 12, 2008, EA Sports announced the extension of its exclusive deal until the [[2012 NFL season]].\n\nLess than a month after the NFL Exclusive deal, EA Sports signed a four-year exclusive deal with the [[Arena Football League (1987\u20132008)|Arena Football League]] (AFL).\n\nOn April 11, 2005, the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) and EA Sports signed a deal to grant EA Sports the sole rights to produce college football games for six years.\n\nEA lost the rights for [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) games to [[2K Sports]] in 2005, ending EA's MVP series; however, EA made [[NCAA Baseball]] games in 2006 and 2007 after losing the MLB license.\n\nIn January 2008, EA Sports decided not to renew their NCAA College Baseball license while they evaluate the status of their MVP game engine.\n\nIn 2005, EA Sports and [[ESPN]] signed a massive 15-year deal for ESPN to be integrated into EA Sports video games from [[2K Sports]] and [[Sega]]. EA's use of the ESPN license has steadily increased over the early life of the deal. EA's early usage of the ESPN license began with ESPN Radio and a sports ticker in titles like Madden NFL, NBA Live, Tiger Woods PGA Tour, and NCAA Baseball and Football. The ESPN integration now includes streaming podcasts, text articles (including content only available previously to ESPN Insider subscribers), and ESPN Motion video (including such programs as ''[[Pardon the Interruption]]'').\n\nIn 2012, EA signs a \"multi-year, multi-product\" partnership with the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]], taking over from [[THQ]].\n\nFollowing the release of ''[[Rory McIlroy PGA Tour]]'' in 2015, EA Sports announced that they will end its [[PGA Tour (video game series)|PGA Tour]] series after 25 years, with the said game was pulled from digital storefronts in May 2018. [[2K Sports]] announced that they will assumed their licensing agreement with the [[PGA Tour]] beginning with the release of ''[[The Golf Glub 2019 featuring the PGA Tour]]'' in 2018.\n\n=== PC games ===\nIn June 2009, EA Sports announced that for 2010, the games ''[[Madden NFL]]'', ''[[NCAA Football series|NCAA Football]]'', ''[[EA Sports NASCAR series|NASCAR]]'', ''[[NHL (video game series)|NHL]]'', ''[[NBA Live (video game series)|NBA Live]]'', and ''[[Tiger Woods PGA Tour]]'' would not be shipped for PC platforms.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=192214 |title=PC News: Peter Moore comes clean on EA SPORTS PC |magazine=[[ComputerAndVideoGames.com]] |access-date=May 29, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704130006/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=192214 |archive-date=July 4, 2008 |date=3 July 2008 |first=Andy |last=Robinson |publisher=[[Future Publishing Limited]]}}</ref> The NCAA Football series had not been released on the PC since 1998, The Tiger Woods series' last PC game was [[Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08]], the NASCAR series had not had a PC version since ''[[NASCAR SimRacing]]'' in 2005, and the last Madden series' to be released on PC was ''[[Madden NFL 08]]''.

{"title_page": "Paik system", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=September 2014}}\nThe '''''Paik'' system''' was a type of [[corvee]] labour system on which the economy of the [[Ahom kingdom]] of medieval [[Assam]] depended, and it is believed that the system is based on the [[South-Eastern Asia]]n legacy the [[Ahom people|Ahoms]] brought with them in 1228. In this system, adult and able males were obligated to render service to the state and form its militia, and in return for which they received a piece of land for cultivation. The mature structure was designed by Momai Tamuli Borbarua in 1608, and extensively and exhaustively implemented by 1658 during the reign of [[Sutamla]] Jayadhwaj Singha.<ref>{{harvcol|Sharma|1996|p=34}}</ref> The system continued to evolve over time to meet the needs of the Ahom state and in time began to accumulate contradictions.  By the end of the [[Moamoria rebellion]] (1769\u20131805) the Paik system had collapsed.<ref>{{harvcol|Sharma|1996|p=51}}</ref>\n\n==''Paik'' system==\nEvery male in the Ahom kingdom between the ages of sixteen and fifty who was not a noble, a priest, a high caste or a slave was a ''paik''.<ref>{{harvcol|Sharma|1996|p=34}}</ref> The paiks were organized into four-member groups called ''got''s.<ref>{{harvcol|Sharma|1996|p=34}}</ref> Each ''got'' had to send one member by rotation for public works. During the absence of a paik the other members of the ''got'' took care of his lands and family. In times of war, the paiks formed the militia. All lands under rice cultivation belonged to the state. Originally, the paiks were organized into ''phoid''s (clans), but by the 17th century the paiks were re-grouped into divisions called ''khel''s.  According to Guha (1991), about 90% of the population belonged to this class at the time of [[Rudra Singha]], around 1714.  The top [[landed nobility|landed aristocracy]] was about 1% and the rest constituted the servile class.\n\n===Land holdings===\nThe duty of a ''paik'' was to render service to the Ahom state in exchange for which he was granted 2 ''puras'' (2.66 acres) of [[usufruct]] cultivable land (''gaa mati''), which was neither hereditary nor transferable.<ref>{{harvcol|Sharma|1996|p=35}}</ref>  In addition he could maintain his tax-free ancestral homestead and garden (''basti'' and ''bari'' respectively).  The nobility maintained personal estates called ''khats''.\n\nCultivable land called ''roopeet'' was held communally that was distributed among the ''paiks'' (called ''gaa mati'').  Wastelands reclaimed by ''paiks'' or non-''paiks'' not covered by a royal grant are subject to inclusion in the ''roopeet'' category to be distributed as ''gaa mati'' in the next ''paik'' survey. Surplus cultivable land was distributed as ''ubar mati'' among the ''paiks''.\n\n===Royal service===\nThe royal services that the ''paiks'' tended to were defense (the Ahom kingdom did not have a standing army till the beginning of 19th century and its army consisted of the [[militia]] formed of ''paiks''), civil construction (embankments, roads, bridges, tanks, etc.), military production (boats, arrows, muskets), etc. There were two major classes of ''paiks'': ''kanri paik'' (archer) who rendered his service as a soldier or as a laborer and ''chamua paik'' who rendered non-manual service and had a higher social standing.  Some other minor classes were: ''bilatiyas'' (tenants at the estates of nobles), ''dewaliyas'' (attached to temples and [[sattra]]s) and ''bahatiyas'' (attached to hill masters).  ''Kanri paiks'' could move up to ''chamua''.  Most of the lower paik officers&mdash;Bora, Saikia, Hazarika, Tamuli, Pachani&mdash;belonged to the ''chamua'' class.<ref>{{harv|Baruah|1993|p=17}}</ref>   \n \nAfter the first major survey recorded in the [[Buranji]]s which was taken in 1510 under [[Suhungmung]], the ''paiks'' were organized according to families and lineage called ''phoids'' and resettled according to their skills. The number of ''paiks'' rendering royal service at any time followed the principle of ''ghar muri e-powa'' or one-fourth the number of ''paiks'' in a household.  The ''paik'' rendering service was rotated and the other ''paiks'' in his household tended to his ''gaa mati'' during his absence.\n\nIn the 1609 restructuring by Momai Tamuli Borbarua the ''phoid'' organization was replaced by the ''got''.  A ''got'' consisted of four ''paiks'' who lived close together.  The ''paiks'' in a ''got'' were numbered ''mul'' (first), ''duwal'' (second), ''tewal'' (third), etc.  In times of peace, generally one of the ''paiks'' in a ''got'' rendered royal service at any given time. In times of war, a second or even a third ''paik'' from a ''got'' could be asked to render service simultaneously. As before, the ''gaa mati'' was tended to by the remaining ''paiks'' of the ''got''. This ensured that economic production did not suffer when a large section of the population was not involved in it and contributed to the resilience of the Ahom kingdom in the 16th to 18th century.\n\nDuring the time of [[Rajeswar Singha]] (1752\u20131789), as the pressure on the ''paik'' system increased, the number of ''paiks'' in each ''got'' was decreased from four to three.\n\n===Organization of the ''paiks''===\nThe ''paiks'' in their ''phoids'' were organized under ''khels'' according to the locality in which they belonged.  Momai Tamuli Borbarua reorganized many such ''khels'' functionally according to the specific service the ''paiks'' in the khel rendered.  Some of the ''khels'' were thus similar to professional or trade guilds.  The organization of the ''khel'' was extended later by his son [[Lachit Borphukan]] into self contained ones by incorporating ''paiks'' of different professions into each ''khel''.\n\n''Khels'' were further organized under a ''mel'' or a ''dagi''.  A group of such divisions was attached to  each of the three great Gohains, which is then called the ''hatimur'' of the particular ''Gohain''.  A second group of divisions was placed under the ''khel'' officers (''Phukan'', ''Rajkhowa'' and ''Barua'') that rendered service to members of the royal family.  The third and the largest group of ''dagis'', organized under ''khel'' officers, rendered service to the king or the state.\n\n===''Paik'' officials===\nThe ''paiks'' in a ''khel'' were organized under a gradation of officials who commanded a set number of them.  They were ''Bora'' (20 ''paiks''), ''Saikia'' (100) and ''Hazarika'' (1000).  More important ''khels'' were commanded by a ''Phukan'' (6000), a ''Rajkhowa'' (a governor of a territory), or a ''Barua'' (a superintending officer) each of whom could command between 2000 and 3000 ''paiks''.\n\nThe ''Phukans'', ''Rajkhowas'', ''Baruas'' and ''Hazarikas'' were nominated by the king and appointed in concurrence with the three great ''Gohains'' ([[Burhagohain]], [[Borgohain]] and [[Borpatrogohain]]). The ''Boras'' and ''Saikias'' were appointed by their respective ''Phukans'' and ''Rajkhowas''. The ''paiks'' had the right to reject a ''Bora'' or a ''Saikia'' and request another officer of their choice.\n\n''Kanri paiks'' could rise to become ''chamua paiks'' and then to higher ''paik'' officials.  Appointments were made irrespective of the ''paik'''s religion or ethnicity.\n\n===Ahom justice===\nThe Ahom justice system was also based on the ''Paik'' system.  Each ''Paik'' official offered justice to the ''paiks'' and each appeal was heard by the next higher officer in the ''khel'' system.  The system of appeals could go right up to the ''Nyayxodha Phukan''.\n\n==Challenges to the ''Paik'' system==\nThe ''Paik'' system was a method by which the Ahom king obtained service from the people and also provided service back to the people.  By the 17th century it had evolved into a robust system that gave the [[Ahom kingdom]] a resilience in the face of a long protracted war against the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]].  But soon it met challenges.\n\nOver time, the nobles began to appropriate the services of ''kanri paik'', who as a ''likchou'' began to work for these high officials instead of the king.  After the end of [[Ahom-Mughal conflicts]], the [[Ahom kingdom]] extended the ''Paik'' system to the regions earlier held by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] but where the royal service  was now payable in cash, following the ''[[pargana]]'' system that was left behind.   The increased production of ''paiks'' and the growth of an internal market over time in the entire kingdom demanded a monetization of the economy, which the ''Paik'' system was unable to handle.  This gave rise to the ''apaikan chamua'' a class of ''paik''s who were released from their ''khels'' and who paid a cash tax in lieu of the service to the king.  The satras too attracted ''paiks'' who wanted to escape the compulsory service.  The satras, in addition, came into competition with the [[Ahom kingdom]] by expanding into new social groups that the [[Ahom kingdom]] would have expanded into otherwise and providing an alternative economic production process.  This conflict with the satras led to the [[Moamoria rebellion]] which further weakened the [[Ahom kingdom]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Citation| last=Baruah | given=S.
