In it, the male narrator describes his attempts to forget about a lover who has left him, by destroying anything that reminds him of her and drinking heavily. Despite his attempts to forget her, he still finds himself attempting to call her on the telephone, and tries to stay awake so as not to dream of her. He states that since he still thinks of her, she is \"more than a memory,\" even though he has been told by others that he will forget about her.\n\n==Chart performance==\nBy debuting at #1 on [[Hot Country Songs]], \"More Than a Memory\" set a new record for the highest debut on that chart, beating the previous record set only one week earlier by [[Kenny Chesney]]'s \"[[Don't Blink]]\", which debuted at #16.<ref name=Cranks>{{cite news | first = Jonathan | last = Cohen | title = Soulja Boy 'Cranks' Hot 100 No. 1 With Debut Single | url = http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1049494/soulja-boy-cranks-hot-100-no-1-with-debut-single | work = | publisher = Billboard magazine | date = 2007-09-06 | accessdate = 2007-09-06 | language = | quote = }}</ref><ref>[http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_headlines/article/0,,GAC_26063_5690035,00.html \"Garth Brooks Back on Top\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709193012/http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_headlines/article/0,,GAC_26063_5690035,00.html |date=2011-07-09 }}, Great American Country, September 5, 2007.</ref><ref>[http://www.cmt.com/news/articles/1568955/20070905/brooks_garth.jhtml \"Garth Brooks Makes History at Country Radio\"], CMT.com, September 5, 2007.</ref> Its chart debut was described by ''Billboard'' as \"almost impossible\", since most #1 debuts on other singles charts (such as the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]) are tabulated by sales, and not on radio airplay alone.

Constitutionally, the position is attached to the office of [[Chairman of the State Affairs Commission|Chairman]] of the [[State Affairs Commission of North Korea|State Affairs Commission]].<ref name=\"CIC\"/>\n\n== History ==\n[[Kim Il-sung]] was the first Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army upon the founding of North Korea in 1948 after he was selected to be the [[List of leaders of North Korea|leader of the country]]. He, upon assumption of power, organized the KPA and had the [[Soviet Union]] equip it with modern weapons, tanks, planes, artillery and ships deemed unusable by the Soviets and communist China. During the [[Korean War]], Kim Il-sung, then the [[General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea|General Secretary]] of the [[Workers' Party of Korea]] (WPK) as well as the [[Premier of North Korea|premier]] of the government and KPA Supreme Commander, took care of the military operations only to be deprived of command by [[China]] in the latter stages. {{clarify|date=May 2017}}. After the war, he resumed command of the KPA even after his election as President of North Korea in 1972. In the 1990s, since he was aged, Kim handed over the post of Supreme Commander of the KPA as well as the chairmanship of the country's [[National Defence Commission]] that supervises military matters to his son and designated heir as the next leader of North Korea, [[Kim Jong-il]] one year before [[Death and state funeral of Kim Il-sung|his death]] in 1994. The elder Kim remained as the President of North Korea, General-Secretary of WPK and Chairman of the party's Central Military Commission, a party organ propagating politics in military affairs. After Kim Il-sung's death in 1994, Kim Jong-il, being the new leader of the country and the KPA Supreme Commander, imposed a ''[[Songun]]'' policy that prioritized the military affairs of the country before anything else. Kim Jong-il on [[Death and state funeral of Kim Jong-il|his death]] in 2011 was succeeded by his son [[Kim Jong-un]], who replaced him as the new leader of the country and military. Kim Jong-un was publicly declared as the new Supreme Commander by the ''[[Rodong Sinmun]]'', on 24 December 2011 and officially appointed to the position on 30 December 2011.<ref name=AFP2011>{{cite news |title=N.Korea declares Kim Jong-Un commander of military |url=//www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jJYCeXinUm40ybUlJzb4_aOAiSAQ?docId=CNG.abd2d9a288a1831892829dfc484f077e.6a1 |accessdate=3 March 2016 |newspaper=Agence France-Presse |date=30 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224223520/http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jJYCeXinUm40ybUlJzb4_aOAiSAQ?docId=CNG.abd2d9a288a1831892829dfc484f077e.6a1 |archivedate=February 24, 2014 }}</ref><ref name=BBC2011>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16325390|title=North Korea: Kim Jong-un hailed 'supreme commander'|date=24 December 2011|accessdate=3 March 2016|publisher=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n== List of officeholders ==\n{{Officeholder table start\n| showorder          = y\n| showimage          = y\n| image_title        = Portrait\n| officeholder_title = Name\n| showtermlenght     = y\n| party_col          = 1\n| showdefencebranch  = n\n| showref            = n\n}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

He, upon assumption of power, organized the KPA and had the [[Soviet Union]] equip it with modern weapons, tanks, planes, artillery and ships deemed unusable by the Soviets and communist China. During the [[Korean War]], Kim Il-sung, then the [[General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea|General Secretary]] of the [[Workers' Party of Korea]] (WPK) as well as the [[Premier of North Korea|premier]] of the government and KPA Supreme Commander, took care of the military operations only to be deprived of command by [[China]] in the latter stages. {{clarify|date=May 2017}}. After the war, he resumed command of the KPA even after his election as President of North Korea in 1972. In the 1990s, since he was aged, Kim handed over the post of Supreme Commander of the KPA as well as the chairmanship of the country's [[National Defence Commission]] that supervises military matters to his son and designated heir as the next leader of North Korea, [[Kim Jong-il]] one year before [[Death and state funeral of Kim Il-sung|his death]] in 1994. The elder Kim remained as the President of North Korea, General-Secretary of WPK and Chairman of the party's Central Military Commission, a party organ propagating politics in military affairs. After Kim Il-sung's death in 1994, Kim Jong-il, being the new leader of the country and the KPA Supreme Commander, imposed a ''[[Songun]]'' policy that prioritized the military affairs of the country before anything else. Kim Jong-il on [[Death and state funeral of Kim Jong-il|his death]] in 2011 was succeeded by his son [[Kim Jong-un]], who replaced him as the new leader of the country and military. Kim Jong-un was publicly declared as the new Supreme Commander by the ''[[Rodong Sinmun]]'', on 24 December 2011 and officially appointed to the position on 30 December 2011.<ref name=AFP2011>{{cite news |title=N.Korea declares Kim Jong-Un commander of military |url=//www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jJYCeXinUm40ybUlJzb4_aOAiSAQ?docId=CNG.abd2d9a288a1831892829dfc484f077e.6a1 |accessdate=3 March 2016 |newspaper=Agence France-Presse |date=30 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224223520/http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jJYCeXinUm40ybUlJzb4_aOAiSAQ?docId=CNG.abd2d9a288a1831892829dfc484f077e.6a1 |archivedate=February 24, 2014 }}</ref><ref name=BBC2011>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16325390|title=North Korea: Kim Jong-un hailed 'supreme commander'|date=24 December 2011|accessdate=3 March 2016|publisher=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n== List of officeholders ==\n{{Officeholder table start\n| showorder          = y\n| showimage          = y\n| image_title        = Portrait\n| officeholder_title = Name\n| showtermlenght     = y\n| party_col          = 1\n| showdefencebranch  = n\n| showref            = n\n}}\n{{Officeholder table\n| order2            = 1\n| image             = Choe Yong-gon.jpg\n| military_rank     = [[File:Vice-Marshal of the DPRK rank insignia.jpg|35px|link=]]<br>[[Chasu|Vice Marshal]]\n| officeholder      = [[Choe Yong-gon (army commander)|Choe Yong-gon]]<br>{{nobold|\uae40\uc77c\uc131}}\n| officeholder_note = \n| born_year         = 1900\n| died_year         = 1976\n| term_start        = 2 September 1948\n| term_end          = 4 July 1950\n| timeinoffice      = {{ayd|1948|09|02|1950|07|04}}\n| alt_party         = Workers' Party of Korea\n}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n!
