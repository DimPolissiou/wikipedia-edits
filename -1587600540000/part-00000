It is Alberta's third-largest city by both population and land area after [[Calgary]] and [[Edmonton]] and the largest city in [[southern Alberta]]. The nearby  [[Canadian Rockies|Canadian Rocky Mountains]] contribute to the city's warm summers, mild winters, and [[Chinook wind|windy climate]]. Lethbridge lies southeast of Calgary on the [[Oldman River]].\n\nLethbridge is the commercial, financial, transportation and industrial centre of southern Alberta. The city's economy developed from [[drift mining]] for coal in the late 19th century and [[agriculture]] in the early 20th century. Half of the workforce is employed in the health, education, retail and hospitality sectors, and the top five employers are government-based. The only university in Alberta south of Calgary is in Lethbridge, and two of the three colleges in southern Alberta have campuses in the city. Cultural venues in the city include performing art theatres, museums and sports centres.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Lethbridge}}\n[[Image:Part of Round Street, Lethbridge, AB.jpg|thumb|left|Round Street in 1911]]\nBefore the 19th century, the Lethbridge area was populated by several [[First Nations]] at various times.

It is Alberta's third-largest city by both population and land area after [[Calgary]] and [[Edmonton]] and the largest city in [[southern Alberta]]. The nearby  [[Canadian Rockies|Canadian Rocky Mountains]] contribute to the city's warm summers, mild winters, and [[Chinook wind|windy climate]]. Lethbridge lies southeast of Calgary on the [[Oldman River]].\n\nLethbridge is the commercial, financial, transportation and industrial centre of southern Alberta. The city's economy developed from [[drift mining]] for coal in the late 19th century and [[agriculture]] in the early 20th century. Half of the workforce is employed in the health, education, retail and hospitality sectors, and the top five employers are government-based. The only university in Alberta south of Calgary is in Lethbridge, and two of the three colleges in southern Alberta have campuses in the city. Cultural venues in the city include performing art theatres, museums and sports centres.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Lethbridge}}\n[[Image:Part of Round Street, Lethbridge, AB.jpg|thumb|left|Round Street in 1911]]\nBefore the 19th century, the Lethbridge area was populated by several [[First Nations]] at various times.

It was nominated for ten [[81st Academy Awards|Academy Awards in 2009]] and won eight{{mdash}}the most for any 2008 film{{mdash}}including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and [[Academy Award for Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. It won seven [[62nd British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Awards]] including [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Film]], five [[14th Critics' Choice Awards|Critics' Choice Awards]] and four [[66th Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globes]].\n\n==Plot==\nEighteen-year-old [[Jamal Malik (character)|Jamal Malik]], an Indian Muslim from the [[Dharavi]] [[slum]], is a contestant on the [[Kaun Banega Crorepati|Indian version of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]], and is one question away from the grand prize. However, before the {{INR|20 million|link=yes}} question, he is detained and tortured by the police, who suspect him of cheating. Through a series of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]], Jamal recounts the incidents in his life that provided him with each answer.\n\nJamal's flashbacks begin when he is five years old. He manages to obtain the autograph of [[Bollywood]] star [[Amitabh Bachchan]] after jumping into an outhouse cesspit. Jamal's older brother Salim later sells the autograph. The incident is followed immediately by the death of the siblings' mother during the [[Bombay riots]]. As the brothers flee the riot they meet Latika, a girl from their slum. Salim is reluctant to take her in, but Jamal suggests that she could be their \"third musketeer\", a reference to the [[Alexandre Dumas]] novel ''[[The Three Musketeers]]''. Although the brothers had read the novel in school, albeit not diligently, and referred to themselves as [[Athos (character)|Athos]] and [[Porthos]], it is revealed that they do not know the third musketeer's name. Latika ultimately joins the group despite Salim's initial refusal.\n\nThe three are found by Maman{{mdash}}a [[Organised crime in India|gangster]] who [[Child trafficking in India|trains street children]] to become beggars. When Salim learns that Maman is blinding the children to make them more effective beggars, he escapes with Jamal and Latika to a departing train. The brothers successfully board the moving train, but Latika is unable to keep up. Salim grabs her hand, but purposefully lets go, leaving her to be recaptured by Maman. For the next few years, Salim and Jamal travel around on top of trains, making a living by selling goods, [[Pickpocketing|picking pockets]], washing dishes, and pretending to be tour guides at the [[Taj Mahal]]. At Jamal's insistence, they return to Mumbai to find Latika, where they discover that she is being raised by Maman to be a prostitute. The brothers rescue her, shooting Maman dead in the process. Salim gets a job with Javed{{mdash}}a rival crime lord. Back at their room, Salim orders Jamal to leave him alone with Latika. When Jamal refuses, Salim draws a gun on him and Latika persuades Jamal to leave.\n\nYears later, Jamal, now a [[Chaiwala]] in an Indian [[call centre]], searches the centre's database for Salim and Latika. Although he fails to find Latika, he learns that Salim is a high-ranking lieutenant in Javed's crime organization.  Jamal confronts Salim, who pleads for forgiveness and offers to let Jamal stay in his luxurious apartment. Jamal lies his way into Javed's residence in order to reunite with Latika. Although he professes his love for her, she tells him to forget about her. Despite the refusal, Jamal promises that he will wait for her every day at five o'clock at the [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus|VT]] station. Latika attempts to meet him there, but she is captured by Javed's men, led by Salim. Jamal loses contact with Latika. In a final attempt to reach her, he decides to become a contestant on ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'', because he knows she watches the show regularly.\n\nJamal is extremely successful on the show, answering every question correctly. He becomes popular across India, much to the dismay of the show's host, Prem Kumar. During a break, Kumar attempts to trick Jamal by feeding him the wrong answer to the penultimate question. When the question is asked, Jamal uses his [[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?#Lifelines|50/50 lifeline]], leaving Kumar's answer and the correct one. Jamal answers correctly, raising immediate suspicion that he is cheating.\n\nWhen the episode ends, Kumar leads Jamal out of the studio and he is forced into a police van. After an initial [[Battery (crime)|beating]], the police inspector listens to Jamal's explanation of how he knew each answer. Finding all of Jamal's stories \"bizarrely plausible\", the officer allows him to return to the show. At Javed's [[Safe house|safehouse]], Latika sees Jamal on the news. In an effort to make amends for his past behavior, Salim gives Latika his mobile phone and car keys. He asks her to forgive him and tells her to find Jamal. Latika is fearful and reluctant, but agrees and escapes. Salim fills a bathtub with money and sits in it, waiting for Javed and his men to realize that Latika is free.\n\nFor the final question, Jamal is asked the name of the third musketeer. He uses his \"Phone-A-Friend\" lifeline to call Salim, because it is the only phone number that Jamal knows. Latika answers and tells Jamal that she is safe, although she does not know the answer to the question. Relieved, Jamal arbitrarily picks the first answer, [[Aramis]]. He is correct and wins the grand prize. Javed hears Latika on the show and realizes that Salim has betrayed him. He and his men break down the bathroom door. Salim kills Javed before he is shot and killed himself. Elsewhere, Jamal and Latika meet on the platform at the train station and kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Dev Patel]] as [[Jamal Malik (character)|Jamal Malik]], a boy born and raised in the poverty of Bombay/Mumbai.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/arts/reviews/film/slumdog_millionaire_boyle |title=Slumdog Millionaire: The Film File: The New Yorker |first1=Anthony |last1=Lane |authorlink=Anthony Lane |date=1 December 2008 |website=The New Yorker |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217071203/https://www.newyorker.com/arts/reviews/film/slumdog_millionaire_boyle |archive-date=2008-12-17 |access-date=24 May 2009}}</ref> Boyle considered hundreds of young male actors, and he found that [[Bollywood]] leads were generally \"strong, handsome hero-types\".

Mitu Sengupta (2009 and 2010) raises substantial doubts about both the realism of the film's portrayal of urban [[poverty in India]] and whether the film will assist those arguing for the poor. Rather, Sengupta argues the film's \"reductive view\" of such slums is likely to reinforce negative attitudes to those who live there. The film is therefore likely to support policies that have tended to further dispossess the slum dwellers in terms of material goods, power and dignity. The film, it is also suggested, celebrates characters and places that might be seen as symbolic of Western culture and models of development.<ref name=\"pmid20607903\">{{cite journal |last1=Sengupta |first1=Mitu |title=A million dollar exit from the anarchic slum-world: Slumdog Millionaire's hollow idioms of social justice |journal=[[Third World Quarterly]] |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=599\u2013616 |date=2010 |pmid=20607903 |doi=10.1080/01436591003701117 }}</ref><ref name=\"Frontline-20090327\">{{Cite magazine |last1=Sengupta |first1=Mitu |date=27 March 2009 |title=Hollow message |magazine=Frontline |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=14\u201327 |url-access=subscription |url=https://frontline.thehindu.com/other/article30186255.ece }}</ref> Ana Cristina Mendes (2010) places Boyle's film in the context of the aestheticising and showcasing of poverty in India for artistic (and commercial) purposes, and proceeds to examine \"the modes of circulation of these representations in the field of cultural production, as well as their role in enhancing the processes of ever-increasing consumption of India-related images.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mendes|first=Ana Cristina|date=July 2010|title=Showcasing India Unshining: Film Tourism in Danny Boyle'sSlumdog Millionaire|journal=Third Text|volume=24|issue=4|pages=471\u2013479|doi=10.1080/09528822.2010.491379|issn=0952-8822}}</ref>\n\nHowever, there are others who point to the changing urban aspirations and prospects for mobility that can be seen in Indian cities such as Mumbai in which the film is set.

Parthasarathy (2009) argues for a better understanding of issues of [[dignity of labour]] and that the film should be interpreted in a more nuanced way as reflecting the role of market forces and India's new service economy in transforming the caste and status determined opportunity structure in urban India.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Parthasarathy|first=D.|date=30 September 2009|title=Of Slumdogs, Doxosophers, and the (In)Dignity of Labour(ers)|journal=SSRN|pages=14|ssrn=2096954}}</ref>\n\nAcademic criticism has also been extended to the underlying philosophy of the film, with its apparent [[Ends justify means|ends-justify-means]] message.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://thegemsbok.com/art-reviews-and-articles/movie-reviews-thursday-theater-slumdog-millionaire-danny-boyle/|title=All's Unwell that Only Ends Well: The Inconsistent Meaning of Life in ''Slumdog Millionaire''|last=Podgorski|first=Daniel|date=17 September 2015|website=The Gemsbok|access-date=16 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180217194649/http://thegemsbok.com/art-reviews-and-articles/movie-reviews-thursday-theater-slumdog-millionaire-danny-boyle|archive-date=17 February 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Many elements of the film, including the apparent redemption of Salim at the end of his life and the film's subjugation of the suffering of peripheral characters to the romantic aspirations of Jamal, are characteristic, say such critics, of a na\u00efve, [[Divine providence|Providence]]-based vision of reality.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Controversies ==\n{{Main|Controversial issues surrounding Slumdog Millionaire}}\n\n''Slumdog Millionaire'' has stirred [[Controversial issues surrounding Slumdog Millionaire|controversy]] on a few issues, including the welfare and [[Illegal housing in India|illegal housing]] of its child actors and its portrayals of Indian communities.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Main|Slumdog Millionaire: Music from the Motion Picture}}\n\nThe ''Slumdog Millionaire'' soundtrack was composed by [[A.

It won seven [[62nd British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Awards]] including [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Film]], five [[14th Critics' Choice Awards|Critics' Choice Awards]] and four [[66th Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globes]].\n\n==Plot==\nEighteen-year-old [[Jamal Malik (character)|Jamal Malik]], an Indian Muslim from the [[Dharavi]] [[slum]], is a contestant on the [[Kaun Banega Crorepati|Indian version of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]], and is one question away from the grand prize. However, before the {{INR|20 million|link=yes}} question, he is detained and tortured by the police, who suspect him of cheating. Through a series of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]], Jamal recounts the incidents in his life that provided him with each answer.\n\nJamal's flashbacks begin when he is five years old. He manages to obtain the autograph of [[Bollywood]] star [[Amitabh Bachchan]] after jumping into an outhouse cesspit. Jamal's older brother Salim later sells the autograph. The incident is followed immediately by the death of the siblings' mother during the [[Bombay riots]]. As the brothers flee the riot they meet Latika, a girl from their slum. Salim is reluctant to take her in, but Jamal suggests that she could be their \"third musketeer\", a reference to the [[Alexandre Dumas]] novel ''[[The Three Musketeers]]''. Although the brothers had read the novel in school, albeit not diligently, and referred to themselves as [[Athos (character)|Athos]] and [[Porthos]], it is revealed that they do not know the third musketeer's name. Latika ultimately joins the group despite Salim's initial refusal.\n\nThe three are found by Maman{{mdash}}a [[Organised crime in India|gangster]] who [[Child trafficking in India|trains street children]] to become beggars. When Salim learns that Maman is blinding the children to make them more effective beggars, he escapes with Jamal and Latika to a departing train. The brothers successfully board the moving train, but Latika is unable to keep up. Salim grabs her hand, but purposefully lets go, leaving her to be recaptured by Maman. For the next few years, Salim and Jamal travel around on top of trains, making a living by selling goods, [[Pickpocketing|picking pockets]], washing dishes, and pretending to be tour guides at the [[Taj Mahal]]. At Jamal's insistence, they return to Mumbai to find Latika, where they discover that she is being raised by Maman to be a prostitute. The brothers rescue her, shooting Maman dead in the process. Salim gets a job with Javed{{mdash}}a rival crime lord. Back at their room, Salim orders Jamal to leave him alone with Latika. When Jamal refuses, Salim draws a gun on him and Latika persuades Jamal to leave.\n\nYears later, Jamal, now a [[Chaiwala]] in an Indian [[call centre]], searches the centre's database for Salim and Latika. Although he fails to find Latika, he learns that Salim is a high-ranking lieutenant in Javed's crime organization.  Jamal confronts Salim, who pleads for forgiveness and offers to let Jamal stay in his luxurious apartment. Jamal lies his way into Javed's residence in order to reunite with Latika. Although he professes his love for her, she tells him to forget about her. Despite the refusal, Jamal promises that he will wait for her every day at five o'clock at the [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus|VT]] station. Latika attempts to meet him there, but she is captured by Javed's men, led by Salim. Jamal loses contact with Latika. In a final attempt to reach her, he decides to become a contestant on ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'', because he knows she watches the show regularly.\n\nJamal is extremely successful on the show, answering every question correctly. He becomes popular across India, much to the dismay of the show's host, Prem Kumar. During a break, Kumar attempts to trick Jamal by feeding him the wrong answer to the penultimate question. When the question is asked, Jamal uses his [[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?#Lifelines|50/50 lifeline]], leaving Kumar's answer and the correct one. Jamal answers correctly, raising immediate suspicion that he is cheating.\n\nWhen the episode ends, Kumar leads Jamal out of the studio and he is forced into a police van. After an initial [[Battery (crime)|beating]], the police inspector listens to Jamal's explanation of how he knew each answer. Finding all of Jamal's stories \"bizarrely plausible\", the officer allows him to return to the show. At Javed's [[Safe house|safehouse]], Latika sees Jamal on the news. In an effort to make amends for his past behavior, Salim gives Latika his mobile phone and car keys. He asks her to forgive him and tells her to find Jamal. Latika is fearful and reluctant, but agrees and escapes. Salim fills a bathtub with money and sits in it, waiting for Javed and his men to realize that Latika is free.\n\nFor the final question, Jamal is asked the name of the third musketeer. He uses his \"Phone-A-Friend\" lifeline to call Salim, because it is the only phone number that Jamal knows. Latika answers and tells Jamal that she is safe, although she does not know the answer to the question. Relieved, Jamal arbitrarily picks the first answer, [[Aramis]]. He is correct and wins the grand prize. Javed hears Latika on the show and realizes that Salim has betrayed him. He and his men break down the bathroom door. Salim kills Javed before he is shot and killed himself. Elsewhere, Jamal and Latika meet on the platform at the train station and kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Dev Patel]] as [[Jamal Malik (character)|Jamal Malik]], a boy born and raised in the poverty of Bombay/Mumbai.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/arts/reviews/film/slumdog_millionaire_boyle |title=Slumdog Millionaire: The Film File: The New Yorker |first1=Anthony |last1=Lane |authorlink=Anthony Lane |date=1 December 2008 |website=The New Yorker |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217071203/https://www.newyorker.com/arts/reviews/film/slumdog_millionaire_boyle |archive-date=2008-12-17 |access-date=24 May 2009}}</ref> Boyle considered hundreds of young male actors, and he found that [[Bollywood]] leads were generally \"strong, handsome hero-types\".

Mitu Sengupta (2009 and 2010) raises substantial doubts about both the realism of the film's portrayal of urban [[poverty in India]] and whether the film will assist those arguing for the poor. Rather, Sengupta argues the film's \"reductive view\" of such slums is likely to reinforce negative attitudes to those who live there. The film is therefore likely to support policies that have tended to further dispossess the slum dwellers in terms of material goods, power and dignity. The film, it is also suggested, celebrates characters and places that might be seen as symbolic of Western culture and models of development.<ref name=\"pmid20607903\">{{cite journal |last1=Sengupta |first1=Mitu |title=A million dollar exit from the anarchic slum-world: Slumdog Millionaire's hollow idioms of social justice |journal=[[Third World Quarterly]] |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=599\u2013616 |date=2010 |pmid=20607903 |doi=10.1080/01436591003701117 }}</ref><ref name=\"Frontline-20090327\">{{Cite magazine |last1=Sengupta |first1=Mitu |date=27 March 2009 |title=Hollow message |magazine=Frontline |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=14\u201327 |url-access=subscription |url=https://frontline.thehindu.com/other/article30186255.ece }}</ref> Ana Cristina Mendes (2010) places Boyle's film in the context of the aestheticising and showcasing of poverty in India for artistic (and commercial) purposes, and proceeds to examine \"the modes of circulation of these representations in the field of cultural production, as well as their role in enhancing the processes of ever-increasing consumption of India-related images.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mendes|first=Ana Cristina|date=July 2010|title=Showcasing India Unshining: Film Tourism in Danny Boyle'sSlumdog Millionaire|journal=Third Text|volume=24|issue=4|pages=471\u2013479|doi=10.1080/09528822.2010.491379|issn=0952-8822}}</ref>\n\nHowever, there are others who point to the changing urban aspirations and prospects for mobility that can be seen in Indian cities such as Mumbai in which the film is set.
