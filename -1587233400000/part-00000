It began on 13 July 2014 as part of a series of operations dubbed \"[[Libya Dawn]]\" or \" [[:ar:\u0641\u062c\u0631 \u0644\u064a\u0628\u064a\u0627|\u0641\u062c\u0631 \u0644\u064a\u0628\u064a\u0627]]\" by a coalition of islamist militias whom led a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] operation against the [[House of Representatives (Libya)]] due to the [[2014 Libyan parliamentary election]] and a series of operations to recapture the Airport and political institutions to wrest control over the capital of Tripoli. The battle ended in August 2014 with the capture of the Airport and ultimately its destruction. The battle was fought between a [[Islamist]] [[New General National Congress]] and the [[Zintan Brigade|Zintani brigades]].\n\n==Background==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[File:Tripoli (June 15 2014).png|thumb|left|Situation in Tripoli mid June 2014; airport is further south]]\nThe Zintani Brigades had provided security for Tripoli International Airport since the 2011 War which overthrew [[Gadhafi]].\n\nAfter the defeat of Islamist politicians in the [[2014 Libyan parliamentary election]], the [[Libya Revolutionaries Operations Room]] and [[Misrata Brigades]] were faced with a largely anti-Islamist [[House of Representatives (Libya)|parliament]]. Their most powerful political ally, [[Nouri Abusahmain]], was faced with an imminent loss of power, and they were likely to lose funding from the [[General National Congress]]. The anti-Islamist politicians who won the 2014 elections had previously tried to disband the Libya Revolutionaries Operations Room due to its attempted coup in 2013, and were able to do so after the election results.\n\n==Combatants==\nThe New General National Congress coalition, dubbed operation [[Libya Dawn]] was composed of the [[Libya Revolutionaries Operations Room]] included the following groups:\n*[[Misrata battalion|Misrata's]] Al Somood batallion led by Salah Badi<ref>{{cite web |title=Libya airport takeover widens political split |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/08/libya-airport-takeover-tripoli-political-split-20148249154577648.html |website=Aljazeera English |publisher=Aljazeera English News - 24 Aug 2014 |accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Military leader that burned Tripoli airport of the capital of Libya to cleanse it from \"Corruption\". |url=https://elqalamcenter.com/2018/08/29/\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0626\u062f-\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0633\u0643\u0631\u064a-\u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a-\u0623\u062d\u0631\u0642-\u0645\u0637\u0627\u0631-\u0637\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0644\u0633-\u064a/ |website=Al-Qalam Center for Research and Studies |publisher=Al-Qalam Center for Research and Studies |accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Tripoli is Again Without an Airport Since Salah Badi\u2019s 2014 Attack |url=https://almarsad.co/en/2019/09/02/tripoli-is-again-without-an-airport-since-salah-badis-2014-attack/ |website=Almarsad.co |publisher=Almarsad news |accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref>\n*[[Ghnewa battalion]] led by Abdul Ghani Al-Kikli<ref>{{cite web |last1=Arfaoui |first1=Jamel |title=Who is Abdulghani Al Kikli? |url=https://tunisie-telegraph.com/2014/07/29/\u062a\u0648\u0631\u0637-\u0641\u064a-\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0642-\u0637\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0644\u0633-\u0648\u062c\u0627\u0621-\u0644\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0627\u062c-\u0641\u064a-\u062a\u0648\u0646\u0633-4434 |website=Tunisie Telegraph (Tunisian Telegraph) |publisher=Tunisie Telegraph 29-07-2014 |accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=5 points of information you didnt know about Ghnewa Al Kikli |url=https://www.afrigatenews.net/article/5-\u0645\u0639\u0644\u0648\u0645\u0627\u062a-\u0642\u062f-\u0644\u0627-\u062a\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0647\u0627-\u0639\u0646-\u063a\u0646\u064a\u0648\u0629-\u0627\u0644\u0643\u0643\u0644\u064a/ |website=Afrigatenews.net |publisher=Afrigatenews.net |accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=All you need to know about \"Operation Dawn of Libya\" |url=https://www.afrigatenews.net/article/\u0643\u0644-\u0645\u0627-\u062a\u0631\u064a\u062f-\u0623\u0646-\u062a\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0647-\u0639\u0646-\u0639\u0645\u0644\u064a\u0629-\u0641\u062c\u0631-\u0644\u064a\u0628\u064a\u0627/ |website=AfrigateNews.net - Africa news portal |publisher=Afrigatenews.net |accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref>, \n*Al-Qabra battalion led by Suleiman Al Shatwan.<ref>{{cite web |title=All you need to know about \"Operation Dawn of Libya\" |url=https://www.afrigatenews.net/article/\u0643\u0644-\u0645\u0627-\u062a\u0631\u064a\u062f-\u0623\u0646-\u062a\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0647-\u0639\u0646-\u0639\u0645\u0644\u064a\u0629-\u0641\u062c\u0631-\u0644\u064a\u0628\u064a\u0627/ |website=Afrigate News |publisher=Afrigatenews.net |accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Misrata leader in the Misrata battalion killed in Tripoli airport clashes |url=https://www.afrigatenews.net/article/\u0645\u0642\u062a\u0644-\u0642\u064a\u0627\u062f\u064a-\u0641\u064a-\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0626\u0628-\u0645\u0635\u0631\u0627\u062a\u0629-\u0641\u064a-\u0627\u0634\u062a\u0628\u0627\u0643\u0627\u062a-\u0645\u0637\u0627\u0631-\u0637\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0644\u0633/ |website=AfrigateNews.net |publisher=Afrigatenews.net |accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref>\n*Supported by Qatari and Turkish military training, Intelligence and arms support<ref>{{cite web |title=Turkey, Qatar accused of delivering weapons to Libyan militants |url=https://www.egypttoday.com/Article/2/7972/Turkey-Qatar-accused-of-delivering-weapons-to-Libyan-militants |website=Egypt Today |publisher=Egypt Today, Sat, Jun. 17, 2017 |accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=United nations Security council report S/2014/106 |journal=UN Security Council report S/2014/106 |date=19 February 2014 |issue=S/2014/106 |pages=20/97  (67.) |url=https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/s_2014_106.pdf |accessdate=27 March 2020 |ref=67.

Early motor cycles were affectionately known as ' Franny B'. Motorcycles were produced for enthusiasts and was reasonably affordable for citizens for use as general transport. The majority of the lighter motorcycles used [[Villiers Engineering|Villiers]] and later [[Two-stroke engine]] and later [[Associated Motor Cycles]] AMC engines. During the 1930s the 250cc Cruiser model {{convert|250|cc|abbr=on}} was developed with a faired engine that protected those riding from any oil or dirt \u2013 one of the first of its kind to do so. AMC took over Francis & Barnett Limited in 1947 combining this with the James motorcycle models in 1957.

He overcame cost factors by first looking at the problem of frequent fractures of the motorcycles frames and evolved a six straight tubular frame with one of the pairs specially formed. The hub of the rear wheel up to the saddle and footrest formed a triangle and the frame below the tank an inverted triangle. The tank itself was held in position by similarly formed tubes. The frame could be bolted together with basic tools. In 1923 he exhibited a machine with this type of frame at Olympia.<ref>http://www.francis-barnett.co.uk/?page_id=27| FB History</ref><ref name=\"Tragatsch\">{{cite book|last=Tragatsch|first=Erwin|title=The New Illustrated Encyclopedia of Motorcycles|year=2000|publisher=Quantum Publishing|location=London|isbn=978-1861603425|pages=560}}</ref> Riders like Tom Meeten took part at Brooklands and Scottish 6-Day Trials and stunts such as riding up Snowdon.<ref>https://speedtracktales.com/folks-n-motors/tommy-meeten-and-the-francis-barnett/</ref> On 12 July 1928 a trio of riders started at the foot of Snowdon at Llandberg Base Station.

The 147cc Villiers two-stroke engine with [[flywheel]] [[magneto]] was light with a two speed Albion gearbox, a three speed was an option, and very easily reassembled and at a very low cost. The construction came with a no breakage forever guarantee. Other 250cc and 350cc machines were also produced with a [[sidecars]] as an option. The Pullman model followed in 1928 with a 344cc vertical in-line two-stroke Villiers engine. From 1928 to 1930 the black motorcycles followed the fashion and were coloured cream. They reverted to black in 1931 and to Arden Green around 1947.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/Q/Francis_barnett_motorcycle|title=Francis barnett motorcycle|website=Answers.com}}</ref> [[File:2015-03-07 - Thinktank - Sasha Taylor - 328.JPG|thumb|]]\n[[File:SLNSW 11535 Fred Loudons motorcycle shop with FrancisBarnett motorcycles corner Elizabeth and Goulburn Street.jpg|thumb|SLNSW 11535 Fred Loudons motorcycle shop with FrancisBarnett motorcycles corner Elizabeth and Goulburn Street]]\n\nIn 1937 Arthur Barnett died aged 74 and his son, Eric took over his fathers position at the company as sales director.

During the air raids over Coventry in 1940 the Frances Barnett Factory was completely destroyed. The company continued making parts during the war at an alternative location. It was not until 1945 that production resumed back at Lower Ford Street with the 98cc Powerbike and then the 125cc Merlin. The Plover, Falcon and Kestrel machines followed.\n\nFrancis Barnett was amalgamated with Associated Motor Cycles in 1947. About that time Francis Barnett brought back the Cruiser names with a 171cc AMC engined Light Cruiser.<ref name=\"britishclassicmotorcycles.com\"/> The motorcycles Plover, Falcon and Cruiser were successful right into the 1950s as good light machines in Arden Green rather than the black finish of earlier days. James vehicles were in maroon. AMC considered Wolverhampton based Villiers to be dictatorial and they commissioned Italian designer Vincenzo Piatti to design a new engine to replace the Villier' engine. The Villiers engine was discontinued in new models in favour of AMC's Piatti designed unit. Unfortunately this did not work well due to cost and unreliability of the AMC manufactured engine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motorcycle-usa.com/2008/10/article/memorable-moto-francis-barnett-cruiser/|title=Memorable Moto Francis Barnett Cruiser - Motorcycle USA|publisher=}}</ref> AMC reverted Francis Barnett bikes back to a Villiers engine again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.workingatamc.london/two_stroke.html|title=Working at AMC - Two Stroke Shop|first=Peter Attwood and Bill|last=Cakebread|website=www.workingatamc.london}}</ref> The Falcon 87 with a 199cc single cylinder two stroke AMC engine was introduced and remained in production until 1966. Also that year the Cruiser 84 with a fully enclosed rear wheel and leg shields as standard equipment was available. The first Cruiser was made in 1932 and is a quiet machine made for riders where special wet proof clothing was not required. The engine being enclosed with good leg-shield and mudguard protection. The Cruiser is displayed at Lord Montague's [[National Motor Museum, Beaulieu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yesterdays.nl/product/francis-barnett-1940/|title=Francis Barnett 1940 - Yesterdays|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalmotormuseum.org.uk/The_Motor_Cycle|title=The National Motor Museum Trust|website=www.nationalmotormuseum.org.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to break away from Villiers\u2019 monopoly supply of engines, AMC commissioned Italian designer Vincenzo Piatti to design all-new two-stroke engines. Piatti was already known to AMC management through his novel, but breathtakingly ugly, Piatti scooters, but the project was a total mess from start to finish. First of all, Piatti's design \u2013 constrained by AMC's demands for cost cutting rather than quality \u2013 was very conservative. Second, it was poorly made by AMC and soon gained a strong reputation for unreliability. Added to this was an all-enveloping dullness which reflected a tired management, distant from its customer base.\n\nIn the early 1960s changes in the marketplace caused a transfer of production to Greet in Birmingham in 1962 to join James motorcycles. The Lower Ford Rd, Coventry Factory was closed down and some staff moved to James. The James and Francis Barnett bikes became virtually the same apart from cosmetic changes of colours and badges.

Early motor cycles were affectionately known as ' Franny B'. Motorcycles were produced for enthusiasts and was reasonably affordable for citizens for use as general transport. The majority of the lighter motorcycles used [[Villiers Engineering|Villiers]] and later [[Two-stroke engine]] and later [[Associated Motor Cycles]] AMC engines. During the 1930s the 250cc Cruiser model {{convert|250|cc|abbr=on}} was developed with a faired engine that protected those riding from any oil or dirt \u2013 one of the first of its kind to do so. AMC took over Francis & Barnett Limited in 1947 combining this with the James motorcycle models in 1957.

He overcame cost factors by first looking at the problem of frequent fractures of the motorcycles frames and evolved a six straight tubular frame with one of the pairs specially formed. The hub of the rear wheel up to the saddle and footrest formed a triangle and the frame below the tank an inverted triangle. The tank itself was held in position by similarly formed tubes. The frame could be bolted together with basic tools. In 1923 he exhibited a machine with this type of frame at Olympia.<ref>http://www.francis-barnett.co.uk/?page_id=27| FB History</ref><ref name=\"Tragatsch\">{{cite book|last=Tragatsch|first=Erwin|title=The New Illustrated Encyclopedia of Motorcycles|year=2000|publisher=Quantum Publishing|location=London|isbn=978-1861603425|pages=560}}</ref> Riders like Tom Meeten took part at Brooklands and Scottish 6-Day Trials and stunts such as riding up Snowdon.<ref>https://speedtracktales.com/folks-n-motors/tommy-meeten-and-the-francis-barnett/</ref> On 12 July 1928 a trio of riders started at the foot of Snowdon at Llandberg Base Station.

The 147cc Villiers two-stroke engine with [[flywheel]] [[magneto]] was light with a two speed Albion gearbox, a three speed was an option, and very easily reassembled and at a very low cost. The construction came with a no breakage forever guarantee. Other 250cc and 350cc machines were also produced with a [[sidecars]] as an option. The Pullman model followed in 1928 with a 344cc vertical in-line two-stroke Villiers engine. From 1928 to 1930 the black motorcycles followed the fashion and were coloured cream. They reverted to black in 1931 and to Arden Green around 1947.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/Q/Francis_barnett_motorcycle|title=Francis barnett motorcycle|website=Answers.com}}</ref> [[File:2015-03-07 - Thinktank - Sasha Taylor - 328.JPG|thumb|]]\n[[File:SLNSW 11535 Fred Loudons motorcycle shop with FrancisBarnett motorcycles corner Elizabeth and Goulburn Street.jpg|thumb|SLNSW 11535 Fred Loudons motorcycle shop with FrancisBarnett motorcycles corner Elizabeth and Goulburn Street]]\n\nIn 1937 Arthur Barnett died aged 74 and his son, Eric took over his fathers position at the company as sales director.

Barnett|website=www.gracesguide.co.uk}}</ref> From 1938 a new 98cc Powerbike was made alongside the 125cc Snipe and these were intended for the military soon after the outbreak of World War Two. During the air raids over Coventry in 1940 the Frances Barnett Factory was completely destroyed. The company continued making parts during the war at an alternative location. It was not until 1945 that production resumed back at Lower Ford Street with the 98cc Powerbike and then the 125cc Merlin. The Plover, Falcon and Kestrel machines followed.\n\nFrancis Barnett was amalgamated with Associated Motor Cycles in 1947. About that time Francis Barnett brought back the Cruiser names with a 171cc AMC engined Light Cruiser.<ref name=\"britishclassicmotorcycles.com\"/> The motorcycles Plover, Falcon and Cruiser were successful right into the 1950s as good light machines in Arden Green rather than the black finish of earlier days. James vehicles were in maroon. AMC considered Wolverhampton based Villiers to be dictatorial and they commissioned Italian designer Vincenzo Piatti to design a new engine to replace the Villier' engine. The Villiers engine was discontinued in new models in favour of AMC's Piatti designed unit. Unfortunately this did not work well due to cost and unreliability of the AMC manufactured engine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motorcycle-usa.com/2008/10/article/memorable-moto-francis-barnett-cruiser/|title=Memorable Moto Francis Barnett Cruiser - Motorcycle USA|publisher=}}</ref> AMC reverted Francis Barnett bikes back to a Villiers engine again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.workingatamc.london/two_stroke.html|title=Working at AMC - Two Stroke Shop|first=Peter Attwood and Bill|last=Cakebread|website=www.workingatamc.london}}</ref> The Falcon 87 with a 199cc single cylinder two stroke AMC engine was introduced and remained in production until 1966. Also that year the Cruiser 84 with a fully enclosed rear wheel and leg shields as standard equipment was available. The first Cruiser was made in 1932 and is a quiet machine made for riders where special wet proof clothing was not required. The engine being enclosed with good leg-shield and mudguard protection. The Cruiser is displayed at Lord Montague's [[National Motor Museum, Beaulieu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yesterdays.nl/product/francis-barnett-1940/|title=Francis Barnett 1940 - Yesterdays|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalmotormuseum.org.uk/The_Motor_Cycle|title=The National Motor Museum Trust|website=www.nationalmotormuseum.org.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to break away from Villiers\u2019 monopoly supply of engines, AMC commissioned Italian designer Vincenzo Piatti to design all-new two-stroke engines. Piatti was already known to AMC management through his novel, but breathtakingly ugly, Piatti scooters, but the project was a total mess from start to finish. First of all, Piatti's design \u2013 constrained by AMC's demands for cost cutting rather than quality \u2013 was very conservative. Second, it was poorly made by AMC and soon gained a strong reputation for unreliability. Added to this was an all-enveloping dullness which reflected a tired management, distant from its customer base.\n\nIn the early 1960s changes in the marketplace caused a transfer of production to Greet in Birmingham in 1962 to join James motorcycles. The Lower Ford Rd, Coventry Factory was closed down and some staff moved to James. The James and Francis Barnett bikes became virtually the same apart from cosmetic changes of colours and badges. The last new model was produced in 1962, the newly designed Fulmar with a spine frame, pressed steel bodywork, leading link forks and 149cc AMC engine. Production of Francis Barnett motorcycles continued until 4 August 1966 when the AMC Empire was taken over by Manganese Bronze. Both Francis Barnett and James ceased to exist from October of that year.<ref>https://cybermotorcycle.com/marques/francis-barnett/</ref><ref name=\"britishclassicmotorcycles.com\"/>\n[[File:Francis-Barnett 175 cc JAP side valve 1926.jpg|thumb|Francis-Barnett 175 cc JAP side valve 1926]]\n[[File:Francis Barnett K 39 Cruiser.jpg|thumb|Francis Barnett K 39 Cruiser]]\n[[File:Francis Barnett Falcon Model 81 200cc (1959).jpg|thumb|Francis Barnett Falcon Model 81 200cc (1959)]]\n[[File:Francis Barnett Plover 150cc (1959) - 14709399311.jpg|thumb|Francis Barnett Plover 150cc (1959) \u2013 14709399311]]\n[[File:Villiers 10D Engine - 8335802962.jpg|thumb|Villiers 10D Engine \u2013 8335802962]]\n[[File:Villiers 10D Engine.jpg|thumb|Villiers 10D Engine]]\n[[File:Francis Barnett Fulmar 88 (1964).jpg|thumb|Francis Barnett Fulmar 88 (1964)]]\n\n==Francis-Barnett Powerbike and Motorcycle Models 1919\u20131966==\nList of models:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cybermotorcycle.com/euro/brands/francis-barnett.htm|title=Francis-Barnett Motorcycles|last=ManxNorton.com|website=Classic Motorcycles by Sheldon's Emu}}</ref>\n\n* 1919/1925 \u2013 Francis Barnet badged Invicta  269cc 4-stroke Villiers engine, 346cc 4-stroke engine, 678cc sv J.A.P chain driven 4-stroke engine and 499cc Abingdon 4-stroke engine, [[Abingdon Motorcycles]]: A Francis Barnett badged Invicta took part in the Isle of Man TT in 1922 but failed to finish.

It is a notorious counterexample in analysis, because it challenges naive intuitions about continuity, derivative, and measure. Though it is continuous everywhere and has zero derivative almost everywhere, its value still goes from 0 to 1 as its argument reaches from 0 to 1. Thus, in one sense the function seems very much like a constant one which cannot grow, and in another, it does indeed monotonously grow, by construction.\n\nIt is also referred to as the '''Cantor ternary function''', the '''Lebesgue function''',<ref>{{harvnb|Vestrup|2003|loc=Section 4.6.}}</ref> '''Lebesgue's singular function''', the '''Cantor\u2013Vitali function''', the '''Devil's staircase''',<ref>{{harvnb|Thomson|Bruckner|Bruckner|2008|p=252}}.</ref> the '''Cantor staircase function''',<ref>http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CantorStaircaseFunction.html</ref> and the '''Cantor\u2013Lebesgue function'''.<ref>{{harvnb|Bass|2013|p=28}}.</ref> {{harvs|txt|first=Georg |last=Cantor|authorlink=Georg Cantor|year=1884}} introduced the Cantor function and mentioned that Scheeffer pointed out that it was a [[counterexample]] to an extension of the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] claimed by [[Carl Gustav Axel Harnack|Harnack]]. The Cantor function was discussed and popularized by {{harvtxt|Scheeffer|1884}}, {{harvtxt|Lebesgue|1904}} and {{harvtxt|Vitali|1905}}.\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:Cantor function.gif|300px|right]]\n\nSee figure. To formally define the Cantor function ''c'' : [0,1] \u2192 [0,1], let ''x'' be in [0,1] and obtain ''c''(''x'') by the following steps:\n\n#Express ''x'' in base 3.  \n#If ''x'' contains a 1, replace every digit strictly after the first 1 by 0.\n#Replace any remaining 2s with 1s.\n#Interpret the result as a binary number. The result is ''c''(''x'').\n\nFor example:\n* 1/4 is 0.02020202... in base 3. There are no 1s so the next stage is still 0.02020202... This is rewritten as 0.01010101... When read in base 2, this corresponds to 1/3, so ''c''(1/4) = 1/3.\n* 1/5 is 0.01210121... in base 3. The digits after the first 1 are replaced by 0s to produce 0.01000000... This is not rewritten since there are no 2s. When read in base 2, this corresponds to 1/4, so ''c''(1/5) = 1/4.\n* 200/243 is 0.21102 (or 0.211012222...) in base 3. The digits after the first 1 are replaced by 0s to produce 0.21. This is rewritten as 0.11. When read in base 2, this corresponds to 3/4, so ''c''(200/243) = 3/4.\n\nEquivalently, if <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> is the [[Cantor set]] on [0,1], then the Cantor function ''c''<nowiki> : [0,1] \u2192 [0,1] can be defined as</nowiki>\n\n:<math>c(x) =\\begin{cases} \n \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{a_n}{2^n}, & x = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \n\\frac{2a_n}{3^n}\\in\\mathcal{C}\\ \\mathrm{for}\\ a_n\\in\\{0,1\\};\n\\\\   \\sup_{y\\leq x,\\, y\\in\\mathcal{C}} c(y), & x\\in [0,1]\\setminus \\mathcal{C}.\\\\ \\end{cases}\n</math>\n\nThis formula is well-defined, since every member of the Cantor set has a ''unique'' base 3 representation that only contains the digits 0 or 2. (For some members of <math>\\mathcal{C}</math>, the ternary expansion is repeating with trailing 2's and there is an alternative non-repeating expansion ending in 1. For example, 1/3 = 0.1<sub>3</sub> = 0.02222...<sub>3</sub> is a member of the Cantor set).  Since ''c''(0) = 0 and ''c''(1) = 1, and ''c'' is monotonic on <math>\\mathcal{C}</math>, it is clear that 0 \u2264 ''c''(''x'') \u2264 1 also holds for all <math>x\\in[0,1]\\setminus\\mathcal{C}</math>. \n\n==Properties==\nThe Cantor function challenges naive intuitions about [[continuous function|continuity]] and [[measure (mathematics)|measure]]; though it is continuous everywhere and has zero derivative [[almost everywhere]], <math display=\"inline\">c(x)</math> goes from 0 to 1 as <math display=\"inline>x</math> goes from 0 to 1, and takes on every value in between.  The Cantor function is the most frequently cited example of a real function that is [[uniformly continuous]] (precisely, it is [[H\u00f6lder continuous]] of  exponent  ''\u03b1''&nbsp;=&nbsp;log&nbsp;2/log&nbsp;3) but not [[absolute continuity|absolutely continuous]]. It is constant on intervals of the form (0.''x''<sub>1</sub>''x''<sub>2</sub>''x''<sub>3</sub>...''x''<sub>n</sub>022222..., 0.''x''<sub>1</sub>''x''<sub>2</sub>''x''<sub>3</sub>...''x''<sub>n</sub>200000...), and every point not in the Cantor set is in one of these intervals, so its derivative is 0 outside of the Cantor set. On the other hand, it has no [[derivative]] at any point in an [[uncountable]] subset of the [[Cantor set]] containing the interval endpoints described above.\n\nThe Cantor function can also be seen as the [[cumulative distribution function|cumulative probability distribution function]] of the 1/2-1/2 [[Bernoulli scheme|Bernoulli measure]] ''\u03bc'' supported on the Cantor set: <math display=\"inline\">c(x)=\\mu([0,x])</math>. This probability distribution, called the [[Cantor distribution]], has no discrete part. That is, the corresponding measure is [[Atom (measure theory)|atomless]]. This is why there are no jump discontinuities in the function; any such jump would correspond to an atom in the measure.\n\nHowever, no non-constant part of the Cantor function can be represented as an integral of a [[probability density function]]; integrating any putative [[probability density function]] that is not [[almost everywhere]] zero over any interval will give positive probability to some interval to which this distribution assigns probability zero. In particular, as {{harvtxt|Vitali|1905}} pointed out, the function is not the integral of its derivative even though the derivative exists almost everywhere.\n\nThe Cantor function is the standard example of a [[singular function]].\n\nThe Cantor function is non-decreasing, and so in particular its graph defines a [[rectifiable curve]].  {{harvtxt|Scheeffer|1884}} showed that the arc length of its graph is 2.\n\n===Lack of absolute continuity===\nBecause the [[Lebesgue measure]] of the [[Uncountable set|uncountably infinite]] [[Cantor set]] is 0, for any positive ''\u03b5''&nbsp;<&nbsp;1 and ''\u03b4'', there exists a finite sequence of [[pairwise disjoint]] sub-intervals with total length <&nbsp;''\u03b4'' over which the Cantor function cumulatively rises more than&nbsp;''\u03b5''.\n\nIn fact, to every ''\u03b4''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0 there are finitely many pairwise disjoint intervals (''x<SUB>k</SUB>'',''y<SUB>k</SUB>'') (1&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''k''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''M'') with <math>\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^M (y_k-x_k)<\\delta</math> and <math>\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^M (c(y_k)-c(x_k))=1</math>.\n\n== Alternative definitions ==\n\n=== Iterative construction ===\n[[File:Cantor function sequence.png|250px|right]]\n\nBelow we define a sequence {''f''<sub>''n''</sub>} of functions on the unit interval that converges to the Cantor function.\n\nLet ''f''<sub>0</sub>(''x'') = ''x''.\n\nThen, for every integer {{nowrap|''n'' &ge; 0}}, the next function ''f''<sub>''n''+1</sub>(''x'') will be defined in terms of ''f''<sub>''n''</sub>(''x'') as follows:\n\nLet ''f''<sub>''n''+1</sub>(''x'')&nbsp;= {{nowrap|1/2 &times; ''f''<sub>''n''</sub>(3''x'')}},&nbsp; when {{nowrap|0 \u2264 ''x'' \u2264 1/3&thinsp;}};\n\nLet ''f''<sub>''n''+1</sub>(''x'')&nbsp;= 1/2,&nbsp; when {{nowrap|1/3 \u2264 ''x'' \u2264 2/3&thinsp;}};\n\nLet ''f''<sub>''n''+1</sub>(''x'')&nbsp;= {{nowrap|1/2 + 1/2  &times; ''f''<sub>''n''</sub>(3&thinsp;''x'' &minus; 2)}},&nbsp; when {{nowrap|2/3 \u2264 ''x'' \u2264 1}}.\n\nThe three definitions are compatible at the end-points 1/3 and 2/3, because ''f''<sub>''n''</sub>(0)&nbsp;= 0 and ''f''<sub>''n''</sub>(1)&nbsp;= 1 for every&nbsp;''n'', by induction.  One may check that ''f''<sub>''n''</sub> converges pointwise to the Cantor function defined above.  Furthermore, the convergence is uniform.  Indeed, separating into three cases, according to the definition of ''f''<sub>''n''+1</sub>, one sees that\n\n:<math>\\max_{x \\in [0, 1]} |f_{n+1}(x) - f_n(x)| \\le \\frac 1 2 \\, \\max_{x \\in [0, 1]} |f_{n}(x) - f_{n-1}(x)|, \\quad n \\ge 1.</math>\n\nIf ''f'' denotes the limit function, it follows that, for every ''n''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;0,\n\n:<math>\\max_{x \\in [0, 1]} |f(x) - f_n(x)| \\le 2^{-n+1} \\, \\max_{x \\in [0, 1]} |f_1(x) - f_0(x)|.</math>\n\nAlso the choice of starting function does not really matter, provided ''f''<sub>0</sub>(0)&nbsp;= 0, ''f''<sub>0</sub>(1)&nbsp;= 1 and ''f''<sub>0</sub> is [[Bounded function|bounded]]{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}.\n\n=== Fractal volume ===\nThe Cantor function is closely related to the [[Cantor set]]. The Cantor set ''C'' can be defined as the set of those numbers in the interval [0,&nbsp;1] that do not contain the digit 1 in their [[base (exponentiation)|base-3 (triadic) expansion]], except if the 1 is followed by zeros only (in which case the tail 1000<math>\\ldots</math> can be replaced by 0222<math>\\ldots</math> to get rid of any 1). It turns out that the Cantor set is a [[fractal]] with (uncountably) infinitely many points (zero-dimensional volume), but zero length (one-dimensional volume).  Only the ''D''-dimensional volume <math> H_D </math> (in the sense of a [[Hausdorff dimension|Hausdorff-measure]]) takes a finite value, where <math> D = \\log(2)/\\log(3) </math> is the fractal dimension of ''C''.  We may define the Cantor function alternatively as the ''D''-dimensional volume of sections of the Cantor set\n\n: <math>\nf(x)=H_D(C \\cap (0,x)). \n</math>\n\n== Generalizations ==\nLet\n\n: <math>y=\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty b_k 2^{-k}</math>\n\nbe the [[dyadic rational|dyadic]] (binary) expansion of the real number 0 \u2264 ''y'' \u2264 1 in terms of binary digits ''b''<sub>''k''</sub> &isin; {0,1}. Then consider the function\n\n: <math>C_z(y)=\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty b_k z^{k}.</math>\n\nFor ''z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1/3, the inverse of the function ''x'' = 2&nbsp;''C''<sub>1/3</sub>(''y'') is the Cantor function.  That is, ''y''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''y''(''x'') is the Cantor function. In general, for any ''z''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;1/2, ''C''<sub>''z''</sub>(''y'') looks like the Cantor function turned on its side, with the width of the steps getting wider as ''z'' approaches zero.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Cantor function is also the cumulative distribution function of a measure on the Cantor set. Different Cantor functions, or Devil's Staircases, can be obtained by considering different atom-less probability measures supported on the Cantor set or other fractals. While the Cantor function has derivative 0 almost everywhere, current research focusses on the question of the size of the set of points where the upper right derivative is distinct from the lower right derivative, causing the derivative to not exist. This analysis of differentiability is usually given in terms of [[fractal dimension]], with the Hausdorff dimension the most popular choice. This line of research was started in the 1990s by Darst,<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The Hausdorff Dimension of the Nondifferentiability Set of the Cantor Function is [ ln(2)/ln(3) ]2|jstor = 2159830|journal = Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society|date = 1993-09-01|pages = 105\u2013108|volume = 119|issue = 1|doi = 10.2307/2159830|first = Richard|last = Darst}}</ref> who showed that the Hausdorff dimension of the set of non-differentiability of the Cantor function is the square of the dimension of the Cantor set, <math>(\\log2/\\log3)^2</math>.

The question mark function has the interesting property of having vanishing derivatives at all rational numbers.\n\n==Notes==\n<references />\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|first1=Richard Franklin|last1=Bass|author1-link=Richard F.

Thus, in one sense the function seems very much like a constant one which cannot grow, and in another, it does indeed monotonously grow, by construction.\n\nIt is also referred to as the '''Cantor ternary function''', the '''Lebesgue function''',<ref>{{harvnb|Vestrup|2003|loc=Section 4.6.}}</ref> '''Lebesgue's singular function''', the '''Cantor\u2013Vitali function''', the '''Devil's staircase''',<ref>{{harvnb|Thomson|Bruckner|Bruckner|2008|p=252}}.</ref> the '''Cantor staircase function''',<ref>http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CantorStaircaseFunction.html</ref> and the '''Cantor\u2013Lebesgue function'''.<ref>{{harvnb|Bass|2013|p=28}}.</ref> {{harvs|txt|first=Georg |last=Cantor|authorlink=Georg Cantor|year=1884}} introduced the Cantor function and mentioned that Scheeffer pointed out that it was a [[counterexample]] to an extension of the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] claimed by [[Carl Gustav Axel Harnack|Harnack]]. The Cantor function was discussed and popularized by {{harvtxt|Scheeffer|1884}}, {{harvtxt|Lebesgue|1904}} and {{harvtxt|Vitali|1905}}.\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:Cantor function.gif|300px|right]]\n\nSee figure. To formally define the Cantor function ''c'' : [0,1] \u2192 [0,1], let ''x'' be in [0,1] and obtain ''c''(''x'') by the following steps:\n\n#Express ''x'' in base 3.  \n#If ''x'' contains a 1, replace every digit strictly after the first 1 by 0.\n#Replace any remaining 2s with 1s.\n#Interpret the result as a binary number. The result is ''c''(''x'').\n\nFor example:\n* 1/4 is 0.02020202... in base 3. There are no 1s so the next stage is still 0.02020202... This is rewritten as 0.01010101... When read in base 2, this corresponds to 1/3, so ''c''(1/4) = 1/3.\n* 1/5 is 0.01210121... in base 3. The digits after the first 1 are replaced by 0s to produce 0.01000000... This is not rewritten since there are no 2s. When read in base 2, this corresponds to 1/4, so ''c''(1/5) = 1/4.\n* 200/243 is 0.21102 (or 0.211012222...) in base 3. The digits after the first 1 are replaced by 0s to produce 0.21. This is rewritten as 0.11. When read in base 2, this corresponds to 3/4, so ''c''(200/243) = 3/4.\n\nEquivalently, if <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> is the [[Cantor set]] on [0,1], then the Cantor function ''c''<nowiki> : [0,1] \u2192 [0,1] can be defined as</nowiki>\n\n:<math>c(x) =\\begin{cases} \n \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{a_n}{2^n}, & x = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \n\\frac{2a_n}{3^n}\\in\\mathcal{C}\\ \\mathrm{for}\\ a_n\\in\\{0,1\\};\n\\\\   \\sup_{y\\leq x,\\, y\\in\\mathcal{C}} c(y), & x\\in [0,1]\\setminus \\mathcal{C}.\\\\ \\end{cases}\n</math>\n\nThis formula is well-defined, since every member of the Cantor set has a ''unique'' base 3 representation that only contains the digits 0 or 2. (For some members of <math>\\mathcal{C}</math>, the ternary expansion is repeating with trailing 2's and there is an alternative non-repeating expansion ending in 1. For example, 1/3 = 0.1<sub>3</sub> = 0.02222...<sub>3</sub> is a member of the Cantor set).  Since ''c''(0) = 0 and ''c''(1) = 1, and ''c'' is monotonic on <math>\\mathcal{C}</math>, it is clear that 0 \u2264 ''c''(''x'') \u2264 1 also holds for all <math>x\\in[0,1]\\setminus\\mathcal{C}</math>. \n\n==Properties==\nThe Cantor function challenges naive intuitions about [[continuous function|continuity]] and [[measure (mathematics)|measure]]; though it is continuous everywhere and has zero derivative [[almost everywhere]], <math display=\"inline\">c(x)</math> goes from 0 to 1 as <math display=\"inline>x</math> goes from 0 to 1, and takes on every value in between.  The Cantor function is the most frequently cited example of a real function that is [[uniformly continuous]] (precisely, it is [[H\u00f6lder continuous]] of  exponent  ''\u03b1''&nbsp;=&nbsp;log&nbsp;2/log&nbsp;3) but not [[absolute continuity|absolutely continuous]]. It is constant on intervals of the form (0.''x''<sub>1</sub>''x''<sub>2</sub>''x''<sub>3</sub>...''x''<sub>n</sub>022222..., 0.''x''<sub>1</sub>''x''<sub>2</sub>''x''<sub>3</sub>...''x''<sub>n</sub>200000...), and every point not in the Cantor set is in one of these intervals, so its derivative is 0 outside of the Cantor set. On the other hand, it has no [[derivative]] at any point in an [[uncountable]] subset of the [[Cantor set]] containing the interval endpoints described above.\n\nThe Cantor function can also be seen as the [[cumulative distribution function|cumulative probability distribution function]] of the 1/2-1/2 [[Bernoulli scheme|Bernoulli measure]] ''\u03bc'' supported on the Cantor set: <math display=\"inline\">c(x)=\\mu([0,x])</math>. This probability distribution, called the [[Cantor distribution]], has no discrete part. That is, the corresponding measure is [[Atom (measure theory)|atomless]]. This is why there are no jump discontinuities in the function; any such jump would correspond to an atom in the measure.\n\nHowever, no non-constant part of the Cantor function can be represented as an integral of a [[probability density function]]; integrating any putative [[probability density function]] that is not [[almost everywhere]] zero over any interval will give positive probability to some interval to which this distribution assigns probability zero. In particular, as {{harvtxt|Vitali|1905}} pointed out, the function is not the integral of its derivative even though the derivative exists almost everywhere.\n\nThe Cantor function is the standard example of a [[singular function]].\n\nThe Cantor function is non-decreasing, and so in particular its graph defines a [[rectifiable curve]].  {{harvtxt|Scheeffer|1884}} showed that the arc length of its graph is 2.\n\n===Lack of absolute continuity===\nBecause the [[Lebesgue measure]] of the [[Uncountable set|uncountably infinite]] [[Cantor set]] is 0, for any positive ''\u03b5''&nbsp;<&nbsp;1 and ''\u03b4'', there exists a finite sequence of [[pairwise disjoint]] sub-intervals with total length <&nbsp;''\u03b4'' over which the Cantor function cumulatively rises more than&nbsp;''\u03b5''.\n\nIn fact, to every ''\u03b4''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0 there are finitely many pairwise disjoint intervals (''x<SUB>k</SUB>'',''y<SUB>k</SUB>'') (1&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''k''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''M'') with <math>\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^M (y_k-x_k)<\\delta</math> and <math>\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^M (c(y_k)-c(x_k))=1</math>.\n\n== Alternative definitions ==\n\n=== Iterative construction ===\n[[File:Cantor function sequence.png|250px|right]]\n\nBelow we define a sequence {''&fnof;''<sub>''n''</sub>} of functions on the unit interval that converges to the Cantor function.\n\nLet ''&fnof;''<sub>0</sub>(''x'') = ''x''.\n\nThen, for every integer {{nowrap|''n'' &ge; 0}}, the next function ''&fnof;''<sub>''n''+1</sub>(''x'') will be defined in terms of ''&fnof;''<sub>''n''</sub>(''x'') as follows:\n\nLet ''&fnof;''<sub>''n''+1</sub>(''x'')&nbsp;= {{nowrap|1/2 &times; ''&fnof;''<sub>''n''</sub>(3''x'')}},&nbsp; when {{nowrap|0 \u2264 ''x'' \u2264 1/3&thinsp;}};\n\nLet ''&fnof;''<sub>''n''+1</sub>(''x'')&nbsp;= 1/2,&nbsp; when {{nowrap|1/3 \u2264 ''x'' \u2264 2/3&thinsp;}};\n\nLet ''&fnof;''<sub>''n''+1</sub>(''x'')&nbsp;= {{nowrap|1/2 + 1/2  &times; ''&fnof;''<sub>''n''</sub>(3&thinsp;''x'' &minus; 2)}},&nbsp; when {{nowrap|2/3 \u2264 ''x'' \u2264 1}}.\n\nThe three definitions are compatible at the end-points 1/3 and 2/3, because ''&fnof;''<sub>''n''</sub>(0)&nbsp;= 0 and ''&fnof;''<sub>''n''</sub>(1)&nbsp;= 1 for every&nbsp;''n'', by induction.  One may check that ''&fnof;''<sub>''n''</sub> converges pointwise to the Cantor function defined above.  Furthermore, the convergence is uniform.  Indeed, separating into three cases, according to the definition of ''&fnof;''<sub>''n''+1</sub>, one sees that\n\n:<math>\\max_{x \\in [0, 1]} |f_{n+1}(x) - f_n(x)| \\le \\frac 1 2 \\, \\max_{x \\in [0, 1]} |f_{n}(x) - f_{n-1}(x)|, \\quad n \\ge 1.</math>\n\nIf ''&fnof;'' denotes the limit function, it follows that, for every ''n''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;0,\n\n:<math>\\max_{x \\in [0, 1]} |f(x) - f_n(x)| \\le 2^{-n+1} \\, \\max_{x \\in [0, 1]} |f_1(x) - f_0(x)|.</math>\n\nAlso the choice of starting function does not really matter, provided ''&fnof;''<sub>0</sub>(0)&nbsp;= 0, ''&fnof;''<sub>0</sub>(1)&nbsp;= 1 and ''&fnof;''<sub>0</sub> is [[Bounded function|bounded]]{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}.\n\n=== Fractal volume ===\nThe Cantor function is closely related to the [[Cantor set]]. The Cantor set ''C'' can be defined as the set of those numbers in the interval [0,&nbsp;1] that do not contain the digit 1 in their [[base (exponentiation)|base-3 (triadic) expansion]], except if the 1 is followed by zeros only (in which case the tail 1000<math>\\ldots</math> can be replaced by 0222<math>\\ldots</math> to get rid of any 1). It turns out that the Cantor set is a [[fractal]] with (uncountably) infinitely many points (zero-dimensional volume), but zero length (one-dimensional volume).  Only the ''D''-dimensional volume <math> H_D </math> (in the sense of a [[Hausdorff dimension|Hausdorff-measure]]) takes a finite value, where <math> D = \\log(2)/\\log(3) </math> is the fractal dimension of ''C''.  We may define the Cantor function alternatively as the ''D''-dimensional volume of sections of the Cantor set\n\n: <math>\nf(x)=H_D(C \\cap (0,x)). \n</math>\n\n== Generalizations ==\nLet\n\n: <math>y=\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty b_k 2^{-k}</math>\n\nbe the [[dyadic rational|dyadic]] (binary) expansion of the real number 0 \u2264 ''y'' \u2264 1 in terms of binary digits ''b''<sub>''k''</sub> &isin; {0,1}. Then consider the function\n\n: <math>C_z(y)=\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty b_k z^{k}.</math>\n\nFor ''z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1/3, the inverse of the function ''x'' = 2&nbsp;''C''<sub>1/3</sub>(''y'') is the Cantor function.  That is, ''y''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''y''(''x'') is the Cantor function. In general, for any ''z''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;1/2, ''C''<sub>''z''</sub>(''y'') looks like the Cantor function turned on its side, with the width of the steps getting wider as ''z'' approaches zero.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Cantor function is also the cumulative distribution function of a measure on the Cantor set. Different Cantor functions, or Devil's Staircases, can be obtained by considering different atom-less probability measures supported on the Cantor set or other fractals. While the Cantor function has derivative 0 almost everywhere, current research focusses on the question of the size of the set of points where the upper right derivative is distinct from the lower right derivative, causing the derivative to not exist. This analysis of differentiability is usually given in terms of [[fractal dimension]], with the Hausdorff dimension the most popular choice. This line of research was started in the 1990s by Darst,<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The Hausdorff Dimension of the Nondifferentiability Set of the Cantor Function is [ ln(2)/ln(3) ]2|jstor = 2159830|journal = Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society|date = 1993-09-01|pages = 105\u2013108|volume = 119|issue = 1|doi = 10.2307/2159830|first = Richard|last = Darst}}</ref> who showed that the Hausdorff dimension of the set of non-differentiability of the Cantor function is the square of the dimension of the Cantor set, <math>(\\log2/\\log3)^2</math>.

The question mark function has the interesting property of having vanishing derivatives at all rational numbers.\n\n==Notes==\n<references />\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|first1=Richard Franklin|last1=Bass|author1-link=Richard F.

It is a [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]]-style church, with stained glass windows, a handcarved main altar, and a striking {{Convert|200|ft|m|adj=on}} spire The parish, part of the [[Archdiocese of Dubuque]], is partnered with [[Saints Peter and Paul Church (Petersburg, Iowa)|Ss. Peter and Paul Parish]], [[Petersburg, Delaware County, Iowa|Petersburg, Iowa]] - the two parishes share a pastor.\n\n==History==\nThe history of the parish can be traced back to the 1840s when a number of [[German American]] families came to the area from [[Ohio]] in search of farmland.  On January 6, 1846, [[Bishop Mathias Loras]] of Dubuque celebrated Mass at the home of Hermann Wiechmann, the first Mass celebrated in the New Vienna area.  For the next two years, Mass was celebrated at the Wiechmann home.\n\nIn 1848, the first permanent structure was built.  This wood building measured {{Convert|24|ft|m}} by {{Convert|30|ft|m}} and had walls that were {{Convert|10|ft|m}} high.\n\nBy 1853, the population had increased to the point that a new structure was needed.  Construction of this new church was completed in 1855.  The church was 64 by {{Convert|100|ft|m}} with {{Convert|22|ft|m|adj=on}}-high walls.  A local resident, William Steffen Sr., was sent with two teams of horses to get three bells for the church.  He arrived back in New Vienna just before [[Easter]]; the bells were raised in time to chime for the first time on Easter Sunday.  This second structure was used until 1887.\n\nIn 1887, the third and present building was completed.  This building is {{Convert|172|ft|m}} long by {{Convert|62|ft|m}} wide.  The walls are {{Convert|35|ft|m}} high.  The stained glass windows are {{Convert|14|ft|m}} wide by {{Convert|30|ft|m}} high.  The steeple is {{Convert|200|ft|m}} high.\n\nThe church has five altars made of carved wood which are still present in the church today.  The old high altar was built by E. Hackner of [[La Crosse, Wisconsin]].  This altar cost $5,000.\n\nThe organ was built in 1891 by the [[Schuelke Organ Company]].  The organ at St. Boniface is one of the few intact Schuelke organs that still exist today.  Aside from regular maintenance, the organ has remained basically unaltered over the years.  One of the few alterations made to the organ was the addition of an electric blower in the 20th century.\n\n[[Image:WSteffenGraveStBonifaceNewVienna.jpg|thumb|left|275px|The final resting place of William Steffen Sr.  As with many of the stones from that time period in the cemetery, the inscription on his monument is in [[German language|German]].]]\n\nIn 2010 workers began constructing a new entryway on the north side of the church when a sinkhole that was 12 feet wide and 8 feet deep was discovered in the basement.  It is not known when the sinkhole formed, but if it had taken out a nearby pillar it could have caused the church building to collapse.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.thonline.com/article.cfm?id=296075 |archive-url= https://archive.is/20120912101049/http://www.thonline.com/article.cfm?id=296075 |url-status= dead |archive-date= 2012-09-12 |title= The 'hole' story: Ground under St. Boniface Catholic Church gives way, but the 1884 edifice does not collapse. |author= Nevans-Pederson, Mary |date= 2010-09-18 |work= Dubuque Telegraph Herald |publisher= Woodward Communications |location= Dubuque, Iowa |access-date= 2010-09-18 }}</ref>\n\n==School==\nSaint Boniface previously had its own parish school, Saint Boniface School, which started operations in 1847.

However, all examples of Dirac matter are unified by similarities within the algebraic structure of an effective theory describing them.\n\n=== General ===\n\nThe general definition of Dirac matter is a condensed matter system where the [[quasi-particle]] excitations can be described in curved spacetime by the generalised Dirac equation:\n:<math>\n \\left[i \\hbar v_D \\gamma^a e_a^\\mu d_\\mu(p) - m v_D^2\\right]\\Psi = 0.\n</math>\nIn the above definition <math>d_\\mu</math> denotes a [[covariant vector]] depending on the <math>(d+1)</math>-dimensional momentum <math>p</math> (<math>d</math> space <math>+ 1</math> time dimension), <math>e_a^\\mu</math> is the [[vierbein]] describing the curvature of the space, <math>m</math> the [[quasi-particle]] mass and <math>v_D</math> the Dirac velocity. Note that since in Dirac matter the Dirac equation gives the effective theory of the quasiparticles, the energy from the mass term is <math>m v_D^2</math>, not the rest mass <math>m c^2</math> of a massive particle. <math>\\gamma^\\mu</math> refers to a set of [[Dirac matrices]], where the defining for the construction is given by the anticommutation relation,\n:<math>\n  \\left\\{\\gamma^\\mu,\\gamma^\\nu \\right\\} = \\gamma^\\mu\\gamma^\\nu + \\gamma^\\nu\\gamma^\\mu = \\eta^{\\mu\\nu} I_d.\n</math>\n<math>\\eta^{\\mu\\nu}</math> is the [[Minkowski metric]] with signature (+ - - -) and <math>I_d</math> is the <math>d\\times d</math>-dimensional unit matrix.\nIn all equations, implicit summation over <math>a</math> and <math>\\mu</math> is used ([[Einstein convention]]). Furthermore, <math>\\Psi</math> is the [[wavefunction]]. The unifying feature of all Dirac matter is the matrix structure of the equation describing the quasi-particle excitations.\n\nIn the limit where <math>d_\\mu(p) = D_\\mu</math>, i.e. the [[covariant derivative]], conventional Dirac matter is obtained. However, this general definition allows the description of matter with higher order dispersion relations and in curved spacetime as long as the effective [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] exhibits the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] structure specific to the [[Dirac equation]].\n\n=== Common (conventional) ===\n\nThe majority of experimental realisations of Dirac matter to date are in the limit of <math>d_\\mu (p) = D_\\mu</math> which therefore defines conventional Dirac matter in which the quasiparticles are described by the [[Dirac equation in curved spacetime|Dirac equation in curved space-time]],\n:<math>\n \\left[i \\hbar v_D \\gamma^a e_a^\\mu D_\\mu - m v_D^2\\right]\\Psi = 0.\n</math>\nHere, <math>D_\\mu</math> denotes the [[covariant derivative]]. As an example, for the flat metric, the energy of a free Dirac particle differs significantly from the classical kinetic energy where energy is proportional to momentum squared:\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathrm{Free~Dirac~particle: \\;} E &= \\pm \\sqrt{\\hbar^2 v_D^2\\mathbf{k}^2+m^2c^4} \\\\\n\\mathrm{Kinetic\\; energy: \\;} E &= \\frac{m |\\mathbf{v}|^2}{2} = \\frac{|\\mathbf{k}|^2}{2m}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nThe Dirac velocity <math>v_D</math> gives the gradient of the <math>E-k</math> dispersion at large momenta <math>k</math>, <math>m</math> is the mass of particle or object. In the case of massless Dirac matter, such as the fermionic quasiparticles in [[graphene]] or [[Weyl semimetal]]s, the energy-momentum relation is linear,\n:<math>\n E(\\mathbf{k}) = \\hbar v_D |\\mathbf{k}|\n</math>\n\nTherefore, conventional Dirac matter includes all systems that have a linear crossing or linear behavior in some region of the energy-momentum relation. They are characterised by features that resemble an 'X', sometimes tilted or skewed and sometimes with a gap between the upper <math>\\vee</math> and lower <math>\\wedge</math> parts (the turning points of which become rounded if the origin of the gap is a mass term).\n\nThe general features and some specific examples of conventional Dirac matter are discussed in the following sections.\n\n== General properties of Dirac matter ==\n\n=== Technological relevance and tuning of Dirac matter ===\n\n[[File:Tuning of Dirac matter.png|thumb|Tuning of Dirac matter: As the density of states is well defined, the density of states at the Fermi level (for fermionic Dirac matter) can be nicely tuned by shifting the chemical potential <math>\\mu</math>. Additionally, introducing a mass term <math>m</math> leads to a gap between the two cones and the dispersion becomes quadratic near <math>k=0</math>.]]\n\nDirac matter, especially fermionic Dirac matter has much potential for technological applications. For example, 2010's [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] was awarded to [[Andre Geim]] and [[Konstantin Novoselov]] \"for groundbreaking experiments regarding the material graphene\". Within the official press release of the [[Swedish Royal Academy of Science]] it is stated that<ref name=\"nobelprize\">[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2010/press.pdf The Nobel Prize in Physics 2010]</ref>\n{{Quote\n|text=\n[...] a vast variety of practical applications now appear possible including the creation of new materials and the manufacture of innovative electronics. Graphene transistors are predicted to be substantially faster than today\u2019s silicon transistors and result in more efficient computers.\n|author=Swedish Royal Academy of Science\n}}\n\nIn general, the properties of massless fermionic Dirac matter can be controlled by shifting the [[chemical potential]] by means of [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]] or within a [[field effect (semiconductor)|field effect]] setup. By tuning the [[chemical potential]], it is possible to have a precise control of the number of states present, since the [[density of states]] varies in a well-defined way with energy.\n\nAdditionally, depending on the specific realization of the Dirac material, it may be possible to introduce a mass term <math>m</math> that opens a gap in the spectrum - a [[band gap]]. In general, the mass term is the result of breaking a specific symmetry of the system. The size of the [[band gap]] can be controlled precisely by controlling the strength of the mass term.\n\n=== Density of states ===\nThe [[density of states]] of <math>d</math>-dimensional Dirac matter near the Dirac point scales as <math>N(\\epsilon)\\propto |\\epsilon|^{d-1}</math> where <math>\\epsilon</math> is the particle energy.<ref name=\"wehling2014dirac\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00018732.2014.927109|title=Dirac materials|journal=Advances in Physics|volume=63|issue=1|page=1|year=2014|last1=Wehling|first1=T.O|last2=Black-Schaffer|first2=A.M|last3=Balatsky|first3=A.V|arxiv=1405.5774}}</ref> The vanishing density of states for quasiparticles in Dirac matter mimics [[semimetal]] physics for physical dimension <math>d>1</math>.

The low-temperature electronic [[specific heat]] of Dirac matter is <math>C(T\\to 0)\\sim T^d</math> which is different from <math>C(T\\to 0)\\sim T</math> encountered for normal metals.<ref name=\"wehling2014dirac\"/> Therefore, for systems whose physical dimension is greater than 1, the specific heat can provide a clear signature of the underlying Dirac nature of the quasiparticles.\n\n=== Landau quantization ===\n[[Landau quantization]] refers to the quantization of the cyclotron orbits of charged particles in magnetic fields. As a result, the charged particles can only occupy orbits with discrete energy values, called Landau levels. For 2-dimensional systems with a perpendicular magnetic field, the energy for Landau-levels for ordinary matter described the Schr\u00f6dinger equation and Dirac matter are given by<ref name=\"wehling2014dirac\"/>\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathrm{Ordinary\\;matter: \\;} E &= \\hbar \\omega_c \\left(n+\\frac{1}{2} \\right), \\\\\n\\mathrm{Dirac\\;Matter: \\;} E &= \\hbar \\omega_c \\sqrt{|n|}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nHere, <math>\\omega_c</math> is the [[cyclotron frequency]] which is linearly dependent of the applied magnetic field and the charge of the particle. There are two distinct features between the Landau level quantization for 2D Schr\u00f6dinger fermions (ordinary matter) and 2D Dirac fermions. First, the energy for Schr\u00f6dinger fermions is linearly dependent with respect to the integer quantum number <math>n</math>, whereas it exhibits a square-root dependence for the Dirac fermions. This key difference plays an important role in the experimental verification of Dirac matter.<ref name=\"novoselov2005two\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature04233|pmid=16281030|title=Two-dimensional gas of massless Dirac fermions in graphene|journal=Nature|volume=438|issue=7065|pages=197\u2013200|year=2005|last1=Novoselov|first1=K.

This property represents a non-trivial, symmetry protected [[topological order]]. As a consequence, electrons in topological insulators can only move along the [[Interface (matter)|surface]] of the material. In the bulk of a non-interacting topological insulator, the [[Fermi level]] is positioned within the gap between the [[valence and conduction bands|conduction and valence bands]].

This has led to recent development of the concept of bosonic Dirac matter.\n\nIn the case of [[bosons]], there is no [[Pauli exclusion principle]] to confine excitations close to the [[chemical potential]] (Fermi energy for fermions) so the entire [[Brillouin zone]] must be included. At low temperatures, the bosons will collect at the lowest energy point, the <math>\\Gamma</math>-point of the lower band. Energy must be added to excite the quasiparticles to the vicinity of the linear crossing point.\n\nSeveral examples of Dirac matter with fermionic quasi-particles occur in systems where there is a hexagonal crystal lattice; so bosonic quasiparticles on an hexagonal lattice are the natural candidates for bosonic Dirac matter. In fact, the underlying symmetry of a crystal structure strongly constrains and protects the emergence of linear band crossings.

An [[anyon]] is a type of quasiparticle that can only occur in two-dimensional systems. Considering [[bosons]] and [[fermions]], the interchange of two particles contributes a factor of 1 or -1 to the wave function. In contrast, the operation of exchanging two identical anyons causes a global phase shift. Anyons are generally classified as ''abelian'' or ''non-abelian,'' according to whether the elementary excitations of the theory transform under an [[abelian group|abelian]] [[group representation|representation]] of the [[braid group]] or a non-abelian one.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0550-3213(91)90407-O |url=http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~gmoore/MooreReadNonabelions.pdf |title=Nonabelions in the fractional quantum hall effect |date=19 Aug 1991 |last1=Moore |first1=Gregory |authorlink1=Greg Moore (physicist) |last2=Read |first2=Nicholas |authorlink2=Nicholas Read |journal=Nuclear Physics B |volume=360 |issue=2\u20133 |pages=362\u2013396 |bibcode=1991NuPhB.360..362M }}</ref> Abelian anyons have been detected in connection to the [[fractional quantum Hall effect]]. The possible construction of anyonic Dirac matter relies on the symmetry protection of crossings of anyonic energy bands. In comparison to bosons and fermions the situation gets more complicated as translations in space do not necessarily commute. Additionally, for given spatial symmetries, the group structure describing the anyon strongly depends on the specific phase of the anyon interchange. For example, for bosons, a rotation of a particle about 2{{pi}} i.e., 360<math>^\\circ</math>, will not change its wave function. For fermions, a rotation of a particle about 2{{pi}}, will contribute a factor of <math>-1</math> to its wave function, whereas a 4{{pi}} rotation, i.e., a rotation about 720<math>^\\circ</math>, will give the same wave function as before. For anyons, an even higher degree of rotation can be necessary, e.g., 6{{pi}}, 8{{pi}}, etc., to leave the wave function invariant.\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{Cite journal|last1=Novoselov|first1=K.S. |last2=Geim |first2=A.K.|date=2007|title=The rise of graphene|journal=Nature Materials|language=|volume=6||pages=183-191}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Hasan |first1=M.

The effective theory of such systems is classified by a specific choice of the [[Dirac mass]], the Dirac velocity, the [[Dirac matrices]] and the [[space-time curvature]]. The universal treatment of the class of Dirac matter in terms of an effective theory leads to a common features with respect to the [[density of states]], the [[heat capacity]] and impurity scattering.\n\n== Definition ==\nMembers of the class of Dirac matter differ significantly in nature. However, all examples of Dirac matter are unified by similarities within the algebraic structure of an effective theory describing them.\n\n=== General ===\n\nThe general definition of Dirac matter is a condensed matter system where the [[quasi-particle]] excitations can be described in curved spacetime by the generalised Dirac equation:\n:<math>\n \\left[i \\hbar v_D \\gamma^a e_a^\\mu d_\\mu(p) - m v_D^2\\right]\\Psi = 0.\n</math>\nIn the above definition <math>d_\\mu</math> denotes a [[covariant vector]] depending on the <math>(d+1)</math>-dimensional momentum <math>p</math> (<math>d</math> space <math>+ 1</math> time dimension), <math>e_a^\\mu</math> is the [[vierbein]] describing the curvature of the space, <math>m</math> the [[quasi-particle]] mass and <math>v_D</math> the Dirac velocity. Note that since in Dirac matter the Dirac equation gives the effective theory of the quasiparticles, the energy from the mass term is <math>m v_D^2</math>, not the rest mass <math>m c^2</math> of a massive particle. <math>\\gamma^\\mu</math> refers to a set of [[Dirac matrices]], where the defining for the construction is given by the anticommutation relation,\n:<math>\n  \\left\\{\\gamma^\\mu,\\gamma^\\nu \\right\\} = \\gamma^\\mu\\gamma^\\nu + \\gamma^\\nu\\gamma^\\mu = \\eta^{\\mu\\nu} I_d.\n</math>\n<math>\\eta^{\\mu\\nu}</math> is the [[Minkowski metric]] with signature (+ - - -) and <math>I_d</math> is the <math>d\\times d</math>-dimensional unit matrix.\nIn all equations, implicit summation over <math>a</math> and <math>\\mu</math> is used ([[Einstein convention]]). Furthermore, <math>\\Psi</math> is the [[wavefunction]]. The unifying feature of all Dirac matter is the matrix structure of the equation describing the quasi-particle excitations.\n\nIn the limit where <math>d_\\mu(p) = D_\\mu</math>, i.e. the [[covariant derivative]], conventional Dirac matter is obtained. However, this general definition allows the description of matter with higher order dispersion relations and in curved spacetime as long as the effective [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] exhibits the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] structure specific to the [[Dirac equation]].\n\n=== Common (conventional) ===\n\nThe majority of experimental realisations of Dirac matter to date are in the limit of <math>d_\\mu (p) = D_\\mu</math> which therefore defines conventional Dirac matter in which the quasiparticles are described by the [[Dirac equation in curved spacetime|Dirac equation in curved space-time]],\n:<math>\n \\left[i \\hbar v_D \\gamma^a e_a^\\mu D_\\mu - m v_D^2\\right]\\Psi = 0.\n</math>\nHere, <math>D_\\mu</math> denotes the [[covariant derivative]]. As an example, for the flat metric, the energy of a free Dirac particle differs significantly from the classical kinetic energy where energy is proportional to momentum squared:\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathrm{Free~Dirac~particle: \\;} E &= \\pm \\sqrt{\\hbar^2 v_D^2\\mathbf{k}^2+m^2c^4} \\\\\n\\mathrm{Kinetic\\; energy: \\;} E &= \\frac{m |\\mathbf{v}|^2}{2} = \\frac{|\\mathbf{k}|^2}{2m}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nThe Dirac velocity <math>v_D</math> gives the gradient of the <math>E-k</math> dispersion at large momenta <math>k</math>, <math>m</math> is the mass of particle or object. In the case of massless Dirac matter, such as the fermionic quasiparticles in [[graphene]] or [[Weyl semimetal]]s, the energy-momentum relation is linear,\n:<math>\n E(\\mathbf{k}) = \\hbar v_D |\\mathbf{k}|\n</math>\n\nTherefore, conventional Dirac matter includes all systems that have a linear crossing or linear behavior in some region of the energy-momentum relation. They are characterised by features that resemble an 'X', sometimes tilted or skewed and sometimes with a gap between the upper <math>\\vee</math> and lower <math>\\wedge</math> parts (the turning points of which become rounded if the origin of the gap is a mass term).\n\nThe general features and some specific examples of conventional Dirac matter are discussed in the following sections.\n\n== General properties of Dirac matter ==\n\n=== Technological relevance and tuning of Dirac matter ===\n\n[[File:Tuning of Dirac matter.png|thumb|Tuning of Dirac matter: As the density of states is well defined, the density of states at the Fermi level (for fermionic Dirac matter) can be nicely tuned by shifting the chemical potential <math>\\mu</math>. Additionally, introducing a mass term <math>m</math> leads to a gap between the two cones and the dispersion becomes quadratic near <math>k=0</math>.]]\n\nDirac matter, especially fermionic Dirac matter has much potential for technological applications. For example, 2010's [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] was awarded to [[Andre Geim]] and [[Konstantin Novoselov]] \"for groundbreaking experiments regarding the material graphene\". Within the official press release of the [[Swedish Royal Academy of Science]] it is stated that<ref name=\"nobelprize\">[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2010/press.pdf The Nobel Prize in Physics 2010]</ref>\n{{Quote\n|text=\n[...] a vast variety of practical applications now appear possible including the creation of new materials and the manufacture of innovative electronics. Graphene transistors are predicted to be substantially faster than today\u2019s silicon transistors and result in more efficient computers.\n|author=Swedish Royal Academy of Science\n}}\n\nIn general, the properties of massless fermionic Dirac matter can be controlled by shifting the [[chemical potential]] by means of [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]] or within a [[field effect (semiconductor)|field effect]] setup. By tuning the [[chemical potential]], it is possible to have a precise control of the number of states present, since the [[density of states]] varies in a well-defined way with energy.\n\nAdditionally, depending on the specific realization of the Dirac material, it may be possible to introduce a mass term <math>m</math> that opens a gap in the spectrum - a [[band gap]]. In general, the mass term is the result of breaking a specific symmetry of the system. The size of the [[band gap]] can be controlled precisely by controlling the strength of the mass term.\n\n=== Density of states ===\nThe [[density of states]] of <math>d</math>-dimensional Dirac matter near the Dirac point scales as <math>N(\\epsilon)\\propto |\\epsilon|^{d-1}</math> where <math>\\epsilon</math> is the particle energy.<ref name=\"wehling2014dirac\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00018732.2014.927109|title=Dirac materials|journal=Advances in Physics|volume=63|issue=1|page=1|year=2014|last1=Wehling|first1=T.O|last2=Black-Schaffer|first2=A.M|last3=Balatsky|first3=A.V|arxiv=1405.5774}}</ref> The vanishing density of states for quasiparticles in Dirac matter mimics [[semimetal]] physics for physical dimension <math>d>1</math>.

The low-temperature electronic [[specific heat]] of Dirac matter is <math>C(T\\to 0)\\sim T^d</math> which is different from <math>C(T\\to 0)\\sim T</math> encountered for normal metals.<ref name=\"wehling2014dirac\"/> Therefore, for systems whose physical dimension is greater than 1, the specific heat can provide a clear signature of the underlying Dirac nature of the quasiparticles.\n\n=== Landau quantization ===\n[[Landau quantization]] refers to the quantization of the cyclotron orbits of charged particles in magnetic fields. As a result, the charged particles can only occupy orbits with discrete energy values, called Landau levels. For 2-dimensional systems with a perpendicular magnetic field, the energy for Landau-levels for ordinary matter described the Schr\u00f6dinger equation and Dirac matter are given by<ref name=\"wehling2014dirac\"/>\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathrm{Ordinary\\;matter: \\;} E &= \\hbar \\omega_c \\left(n+\\frac{1}{2} \\right), \\\\\n\\mathrm{Dirac\\;Matter: \\;} E &= \\hbar \\omega_c \\sqrt{|n|}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nHere, <math>\\omega_c</math> is the [[cyclotron frequency]] which is linearly dependent of the applied magnetic field and the charge of the particle. There are two distinct features between the Landau level quantization for 2D Schr\u00f6dinger fermions (ordinary matter) and 2D Dirac fermions. First, the energy for Schr\u00f6dinger fermions is linearly dependent with respect to the integer quantum number <math>n</math>, whereas it exhibits a square-root dependence for the Dirac fermions. This key difference plays an important role in the experimental verification of Dirac matter.<ref name=\"novoselov2005two\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature04233|pmid=16281030|title=Two-dimensional gas of massless Dirac fermions in graphene|journal=Nature|volume=438|issue=7065|pages=197\u2013200|year=2005|last1=Novoselov|first1=K.

This property represents a non-trivial, symmetry protected [[topological order]]. As a consequence, electrons in topological insulators can only move along the [[Interface (matter)|surface]] of the material. In the bulk of a non-interacting topological insulator, the [[Fermi level]] is positioned within the gap between the [[valence and conduction bands|conduction and valence bands]]. On the surface, there are special states within the bulk [[energy gap]] which can be effectively described by a Dirac Hamiltonian: \n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n{\\cal H} = \\hbar v_{D} (\\mathbf{k}\\times \\mathbf{\\sigma})\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nwhere <math>\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}</math> is normal to the surface and <math>{\\mathbf{\\sigma}}</math> is in the real [[spin (physics)|spin]] basis.

In contrast to the fermionic case where Pauli exclusion confines excitations close to the Fermi energy, the description of boson requires the entire Brillioun zone.]]\nWhile historic interest focussed on fermionic quasiparticles that have potential for technological applications, particularly in electronics, the mathematical structure of the [[Dirac equation]] is not restricted to the [[Particle statistics|statistics of the particles]]. This has led to recent development of the concept of bosonic Dirac matter.\n\nIn the case of [[bosons]], there is no [[Pauli exclusion principle]] to confine excitations close to the [[chemical potential]] (Fermi energy for fermions) so the entire [[Brillouin zone]] must be included. At low temperatures, the bosons will collect at the lowest energy point, the <math>\\Gamma</math>-point of the lower band. Energy must be added to excite the quasiparticles to the vicinity of the linear crossing point.\n\nSeveral examples of Dirac matter with fermionic quasi-particles occur in systems where there is a hexagonal crystal lattice; so bosonic quasiparticles on an hexagonal lattice are the natural candidates for bosonic Dirac matter. In fact, the underlying symmetry of a crystal structure strongly constrains and protects the emergence of linear band crossings. Typical bosonic [[quasiparticles]] in [[condensed matter]] are [[magnon]]s, [[phonons]], [[polaritons]] and [[plasmons]].\n\nExisting examples of bosonic Dirac matter include transition metal [[halides]] such as CrX<math>_3</math> (X= Cl, Br, I), where the [[magnon]] spectrum exhibits linear crossings,<ref name=\"pershoguba2018dirac\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevX.8.011010|title=Dirac Magnons in Honeycomb Ferromagnets|journal=Physical Review X|volume=8|issue=1|pages=011010|year=2018|last1=Pershoguba|first1=Sergey S|last2=Banerjee|first2=Saikat|last3=Lashley|first3=J.\u2009C|last4=Park|first4=Jihwey|last5=\u00c5gren|first5=Hans|last6=Aeppli|first6=Gabriel|last7=Balatsky|first7=Alexander V|arxiv=1706.03384|bibcode=2018PhRvX...8a1010P}}</ref> granular [[superconductors]] in a [[honeycomb lattice]] <ref name=\"Banerjee\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.93.134502|title=Granular superconductor in a honeycomb lattice as a realization of bosonic Dirac material|journal=Physical Review B|volume=93|issue=13|pages=134502|year=2016|last1=Banerjee|first1=S|last2=Fransson|first2=J|last3=Black-Schaffer|first3=A.

An [[anyon]] is a type of quasiparticle that can only occur in two-dimensional systems. Considering [[bosons]] and [[fermions]], the interchange of two particles contributes a factor of 1 or -1 to the wave function. In contrast, the operation of exchanging two identical anyons causes a global phase shift. Anyons are generally classified as ''abelian'' or ''non-abelian,'' according to whether the elementary excitations of the theory transform under an [[abelian group|abelian]] [[group representation|representation]] of the [[braid group]] or a non-abelian one.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0550-3213(91)90407-O |url=http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~gmoore/MooreReadNonabelions.pdf |title=Nonabelions in the fractional quantum hall effect |date=19 Aug 1991 |last1=Moore |first1=Gregory |authorlink1=Greg Moore (physicist) |last2=Read |first2=Nicholas |authorlink2=Nicholas Read |journal=Nuclear Physics B |volume=360 |issue=2\u20133 |pages=362\u2013396 |bibcode=1991NuPhB.360..362M }}</ref> Abelian anyons have been detected in connection to the [[fractional quantum Hall effect]]. The possible construction of anyonic Dirac matter relies on the symmetry protection of crossings of anyonic energy bands. In comparison to bosons and fermions the situation gets more complicated as translations in space do not necessarily commute. Additionally, for given spatial symmetries, the group structure describing the anyon strongly depends on the specific phase of the anyon interchange. For example, for bosons, a rotation of a particle about 2{{pi}} i.e., 360<math>^\\circ</math>, will not change its wave function. For fermions, a rotation of a particle about 2{{pi}}, will contribute a factor of <math>-1</math> to its wave function, whereas a 4{{pi}} rotation, i.e., a rotation about 720<math>^\\circ</math>, will give the same wave function as before. For anyons, an even higher degree of rotation can be necessary, e.g., 6{{pi}}, 8{{pi}}, etc., to leave the wave function invariant.\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{Cite journal|last1=Novoselov|first1=K.S. |last2=Geim |first2=A.K.|date=2007|title=The rise of graphene|journal=Nature Materials|language=|volume=6||pages=183-191}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Hasan |first1=M.

He appeared in the [[Marx Brothers]]' 1929 film debut ''[[The Cocoanuts]]''. MacLane made his first credited film appearance in the 1931 romantic drama ''[[His Woman]]''. The following year, he wrote the play ''Rendezvous'', which he sold to [[Arthur Hopkins]]. The play was performed on Broadway, with MacLane in a featured role.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0533692/bio|title=Barton Maclane Biography|website=IMDB}}</ref>\n\n===Film work: 1930s-1950s===\n[[File:Barton MacLane in Smart Blonde trailer.jpg|thumb|MacLane in ''[[Smart Blonde]]'' (1937)]]\n[[File:Maltese-Falcon-Tell-the-Truth-1941.jpg|thumb|right|[[Humphrey Bogart]], [[Mary Astor]], MacLane, [[Peter Lorre]] and [[Ward Bond]] in ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' (1941)]]\nThe success of ''Rendezvous'' landed MacLane a contract with [[Warner Bros.]] and brought him to the attention of several renowned film directors, including [[Fritz Lang]], [[Michael Curtiz]], and [[William Keighley]]. As a result, throughout the remainder of the 1930s, MacLane was highly active in film, with major supporting roles in such productions as ''[[The Case of the Curious Bride]]'', ''[[G Men]]'', ''[[The Prince and the Pauper (1937 film)|The Prince and the Pauper]]'', and Lang's ''[[You Only Live Once (1937 film)|You Only Live Once]]'' and ''[[You and Me (1938 film)|You and Me]]''. He also played the role of detective Steve McBride, opposite [[Glenda Farrell]] in seven of the nine films featuring the fictional newspaper reporter [[Torchy Blane]].\n\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, MacLane worked alongside [[Humphrey Bogart]] in several films. He played Lieutenant Dundy opposite Bogart's [[Sam Spade]] in ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'', writer/director [[John Huston]]'s acclaimed [[film noir]] based upon [[Dashiell Hammett]]'s [[The Maltese Falcon (novel)|novel]]. MacLane again collaborated with both Bogart and Huston on the Academy Award-winning 1948 adventure film ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]''.\n\nMacLane's many other film credits during the 1940s include ''[[The Big Street]]'', [[Victor Fleming]]'s ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1941 film)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'', Fritz Lang's ''[[Western Union (film)|Western Union]]'', [[Reginald Le Borg]]'s ''[[The Mummy's Ghost]]'', and [[Frank Borzage]]'s ''[[The Spanish Main]]''. He also appeared in two ''[[Tarzan]]'' films starring [[Johnny Weissmuller]], ''[[Tarzan and the Amazons]]'' and ''[[Tarzan and the Huntress]]''. Some of MacLane's films during the 1950s include ''[[Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye (film)|Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye]]'', ''[[The Glenn Miller Story]]'', and ''[[Three Violent People]]''. In 1955 MacLane appeared as Jim Mablett in the movie ''[[Foxfire (1955 film)|Foxfire]]'' co-starring ''[[Jane Russell]]''.\n\nAs he was the regular heavy and bad guy, juveniles started using the term \"Don't give me that Barton MacLane\", if they felt justly or unjustly being turned off by adults or authorities, e.g. cops, teachers and so on.\n\n===Television and final films===\nIn the 1950s, MacLane began to appear regularly on television. Between 1953 and 1967, he guest starred on such programs as ''[[Conflict (TV series)|Conflict]]'', ''[[Lux Video Theatre]]'', ''[[Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse]]'', ''[[Laramie (TV series)|Laramie]]'', ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]'', and ''[[Gunsmoke]]''.  In 1958 he played Sen. Harriman Baylor in the ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' episode, \"The Case of the Foot-Loose Doll\".  In 1960 he played Eugene Norris, Perry's friend and small-town sheriff, in \"The Case of the Violent Village\".  In 1964 he played Archer Osmond in \"The Case of the Ruinous Road\".\n\nDuring the 1960-1961 [[television season]], MacLane was a series regular on twenty-seven episodes of NBC's  [[Western (genre)|western]], ''Outlaws'', in which he played Marshal Frank Caine.{{r|etvs|page1=802}} His last feature film was ''[[Buckskin (film)|Buckskin]]'' (1968).\n\nIn 1965, MacLane was cast in the recurring role of General Martin Peterson on ''I Dream of Jeannie''. He appeared in 35 episodes of the series between 1965 and 1969. Three of MacLane's episodes were aired after his death in January 1969. His character was replaced on later episodes of the series by General Winfield Schaeffer, portrayed by [[Vinton Hayworth]], until his death in 1970. Coincidentally, Hayworth also died before all episodes featuring his character were broadcast.\n\n==Personal life==\nMaclane played several musical instruments, including the violin, piano, and guitar. In 1939, MacLane married actress [[Charlotte Wynters]]. From the 1940s until his death, he maintained a cattle [[ranch]] in eastern [[Madera County, California|Madera County]], California, where he made his home when he was not acting.

As a result, throughout the remainder of the 1930s, MacLane was highly active in film, with major supporting roles in such productions as ''[[The Case of the Curious Bride]]'', ''[[G Men]]'', ''[[The Prince and the Pauper (1937 film)|The Prince and the Pauper]]'', and Lang's ''[[You Only Live Once (1937 film)|You Only Live Once]]'' and ''[[You and Me (1938 film)|You and Me]]''. He also played the role of detective Steve McBride, opposite [[Glenda Farrell]] in seven of the nine films featuring the fictional newspaper reporter [[Torchy Blane]].\n\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, MacLane worked alongside [[Humphrey Bogart]] in several films. He played Lieutenant Dundy opposite Bogart's [[Sam Spade]] in ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'', writer/director [[John Huston]]'s acclaimed [[film noir]] based upon [[Dashiell Hammett]]'s [[The Maltese Falcon (novel)|novel]].

Some of MacLane's films during the 1950s include ''[[Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye (film)|Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye]]'', ''[[The Glenn Miller Story]]'', and ''[[Three Violent People]]''. In 1955 MacLane appeared as Jim Mablett in the movie ''[[Foxfire (1955 film)|Foxfire]]'' co-starring ''[[Jane Russell]]''.\n\nAs he was the regular heavy and bad guy, juveniles started using the term \"Don't give me that Barton MacLane\", if they felt justly or unjustly being turned off by adults or authorities, e.g. cops, teachers and so on.\n\n===Television and final films===\nIn the 1950s, MacLane began to appear regularly on television. Between 1953 and 1967, he guest starred on such programs as ''[[Conflict (TV series)|Conflict]]'', ''[[Lux Video Theatre]]'', ''[[Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse]]'', ''[[Laramie (TV series)|Laramie]]'', ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]'', and ''[[Gunsmoke]]''.  In 1958 he played Sen. Harriman Baylor in the ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' episode, \"The Case of the Foot-Loose Doll\".  In 1960 he played Eugene Norris, Perry's friend and small-town sheriff, in \"The Case of the Violent Village\".  In 1964 he played Archer Osmond in \"The Case of the Ruinous Road\".\n\nDuring the 1960-1961 [[television season]], MacLane was a series regular on twenty-seven episodes of NBC's  [[Western (genre)|western]], ''Outlaws'', in which he played Marshal Frank Caine.{{r|etvs|page1=802}} His last feature film was ''[[Buckskin (film)|Buckskin]]'' (1968).\n\nIn 1965, MacLane was cast in the recurring role of General Martin Peterson on ''I Dream of Jeannie''. He appeared in 35 episodes of the series between 1965 and 1969. Three of MacLane's episodes were aired after his death in January 1969. His character was replaced on later episodes of the series by General Winfield Schaeffer, portrayed by [[Vinton Hayworth]], until his death in 1970. Coincidentally, Hayworth also died before all episodes featuring his character were broadcast.\n\n==Personal life==\nMaclane played several musical instruments, including the violin, piano, and guitar. In 1939, MacLane married actress [[Charlotte Wynters]]. From the 1940s until his death, he maintained a cattle [[ranch]] in eastern [[Madera County, California|Madera County]], California, where he made his home when he was not acting.

The film is the [[directorial debut]] of [[Rupert Sanders]], with a screenplay by [[Evan Daugherty]], [[John Lee Hancock]] and [[Hossein Amini]], from a screen story by Daugherty. The cast includes [[Kristen Stewart]], [[Charlize Theron]], [[Chris Hemsworth]], [[Sam Claflin]], and [[Bob Hoskins]] in his final film performance. In the film's retelling of the tale, Snow White grows up imprisoned by her evil stepmother, [[Queen (Snow White)|Queen Ravenna]], a powerful sorceress. After Snow White escapes into the forest, Ravenna tells [[Huntsman (Snow White)|Eric, the Huntsman]] that she will bring back his dead wife if he captures Snow White.\n\n''Snow White and the Huntsman'' was theatrically released in the United Kingdom on May 30, 2012 and in the United States on June 1, 2012, by [[Universal Pictures]]. It was a success at the box office, earning $396.6 million worldwide against a $170 million budget. Although critics praised the production design, visual effects, Theron and Hemsworth's performances, musical score, and action sequences; Stewart and Claflin's performances received mixed reviews, and the screenplay was heavily criticized. The film received two [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]] and [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]] at the [[85th Academy Awards]].\n\nA [[prequel]]/[[sequel]], titled ''[[The Huntsman: Winter's War]]'', directed by the first film's visual effects supervisor [[Cedric Nicolas-Troyan]], was released on April 22, 2016. Hemsworth, Theron, Claflin and [[Nick Frost]] reprised their roles and new characters were played by [[Emily Blunt]] and [[Jessica Chastain]]. Stewart did not reprise her role, but appeared in [[archive footage]].\n\n==Plot==\nWhile admiring a rose blooming in the winter, Queen Eleanor of the kingdom of Tabor pricks her finger on one of its thorns. Drops of blood fall onto the snow, and she wishes for a daughter as white as the snow, with lips as red as the blood, hair as black as a raven's wings and heart as strong as the rose. She gives birth to a daughter, [[Snow White]], but falls ill and dies several years later. After her death, Snow White's father, [[King (Snow White)|King Magnus]], and his army battle an invading dark army of demonic glass soldiers. Upon rescuing their prisoner Ravenna, the King becomes enchanted with her beauty and marries her.\n\n[[Queen (Snow White)|Ravenna]] is in fact a powerful sorceress and the Dark Army's master. On their wedding night, Ravenna confesses there was a king much like Magnus that hurt her. She declares she cannot be a weak queen and kills Magnus before taking over the kingdom. Snow White's childhood friend William and his father, Duke Hammond, escape the castle but are unable to rescue her, and she is captured and locked away in a tower for many years.\n\nTabor is ruined under Queen Ravenna's rule. She periodically drains the youth from the kingdom's young women in order to maintain a spell cast over her as a child by her mother, which allows her to keep her youthful beauty. When her stepdaughter Snow White comes of age, she learns from her [[Magic Mirror (Snow White)|Magic Mirror]] that Snow White is destined to destroy her unless she consumes the girl's heart, which will make her immortal. Ravenna orders her brother Finn to bring her Snow White's heart, but Snow White escapes into the Dark Forest, where Ravenna has no power. Ravenna makes a bargain with [[Huntsman (Snow White)|Eric the Huntsman]], a widower and drunkard, to capture Snow White, promising to bring his wife back to life in exchange. The Huntsman tracks down Snow White, but when Finn reveals that Ravenna does not actually have the power to revive the dead, the Huntsman helps Snow White escape. Finn gathers a band of men to find her, and the Duke and William learn that she is alive. William leaves the castle to find her, joining Finn's band as a [[Archery|bowman]].\n\nThe Huntsman and Snow White leave the Dark Forest, where she saves his life by charming a huge troll that attacks them. They make their way to a fishing village populated by women who have disfigured themselves to make themselves useless to the Queen. The Huntsman learns Snow White's true identity, and leaves her in the care of the women. He returns when he sees the village being burned down by Finn's men. Snow White and the Huntsman evade them and meet a band of [[Seven Dwarfs|eight dwarves]]. The blind dwarf Muir perceives that Snow White is the only person who can defeat Ravenna and end her reign.\n\nAs they travel through a fairy sanctuary, they are attacked by Finn and his men. A battle ensues during which Finn, his men, and one of the dwarfs are killed, while William reveals himself and joins the group on their journey to Hammond's castle. Halfway there, Ravenna disguises herself as William and tempts Snow White into eating a poisoned apple. She flees when the Huntsman and William discover her. William kisses Snow White but she does not wake up (though no one notices the tear that comes from one of her eyes). Her body is taken to Hammond's castle. The Huntsman professes his regret for not being there to save her, as her heart and strength remind him of his late wife, Sara. He kisses her and does not notice a second tear fall from one of her eyes, as his kiss was second of true love needed. Snow White awakens and rallies the Duke's army to mount a siege against Ravenna.\n\nThe dwarves infiltrate the castle through the sewers and open the gates, allowing the Duke's army inside. Snow White confronts Ravenna, but is overpowered. Ravenna is about to kill her when Snow White uses a move the Huntsman taught her and mortally wounds Ravenna, defeating her for good.

Huntsman''''' is a 2012 American [[dark fantasy|dark fantasy film]] based on the German fairy tale \"[[Snow White]]\" compiled by the [[Brothers Grimm]]. The film is the [[directorial debut]] of [[Rupert Sanders]], with a screenplay by [[Evan Daugherty]], [[John Lee Hancock]] and [[Hossein Amini]], from a screen story by Daugherty. The cast includes [[Kristen Stewart]], [[Charlize Theron]], [[Chris Hemsworth]], [[Sam Claflin]], and [[Bob Hoskins]] in his final film performance. In the film's retelling of the tale, Snow White grows up imprisoned by her evil stepmother, [[Queen (Snow White)|Queen Ravenna]], a powerful sorceress. After Snow White escapes into the forest, Ravenna tells [[Huntsman (Snow White)|Eric, the Huntsman]] that she will bring back his dead wife if he captures Snow White.\n\n''Snow White and the Huntsman'' was theatrically released in the United Kingdom on May 30, 2012 and in the United States on June 1, 2012, by [[Universal Pictures]]. It was a success at the box office, earning $396.6 million worldwide against a $170 million budget. Although critics praised the production design, visual effects, Theron and Hemsworth's performances, musical score, and action sequences; Stewart and Claflin's performances received mixed reviews, and the screenplay was heavily criticized. The film received two [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]] and [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]] at the [[85th Academy Awards]].\n\nA [[prequel]]/[[sequel]], titled ''[[The Huntsman: Winter's War]]'', directed by the first film's visual effects supervisor [[Cedric Nicolas-Troyan]], was released on April 22, 2016. Hemsworth, Theron, Claflin and [[Nick Frost]] reprised their roles and new characters were played by [[Emily Blunt]] and [[Jessica Chastain]]. Stewart did not reprise her role, but appeared in [[archive footage]].\n\n==Plot==\nWhile admiring a rose blooming in the winter, Queen Eleanor of the kingdom of Tabor pricks her finger on one of its thorns. Drops of blood fall onto the snow, and she wishes for a daughter as white as the snow, with lips as red as the blood, hair as black as a raven's wings and heart as strong as the rose. She gives birth to a daughter, [[Snow White]], but falls ill and dies several years later. After her death, Snow White's father, [[King (Snow White)|King Magnus]], and his army battle an invading dark army of demonic glass soldiers. Upon rescuing their prisoner Ravenna, the King becomes enchanted with her beauty and marries her.\n\n[[Queen (Snow White)|Ravenna]] is in fact a powerful sorceress and the Dark Army's master. On their wedding night, Ravenna confesses there was a king much like Magnus that hurt her. She declares she cannot be a weak queen and kills Magnus before taking over the kingdom. Snow White's childhood friend William and his father, Duke Hammond, escape the castle but are unable to rescue her, and she is captured and locked away in a tower for many years.\n\nTabor is ruined under Queen Ravenna's rule. She periodically drains the youth from the kingdom's young women in order to maintain a spell cast over her as a child by her mother, which allows her to keep her youthful beauty. When her stepdaughter Snow White comes of age, she learns from her [[Magic Mirror (Snow White)|Magic Mirror]] that Snow White is destined to destroy her unless she consumes the girl's heart, which will make her immortal. Ravenna orders her brother Finn to bring her Snow White's heart, but Snow White escapes into the Dark Forest, where Ravenna has no power. Ravenna makes a bargain with [[Huntsman (Snow White)|Eric the Huntsman]], a widower and drunkard, to capture Snow White, promising to bring his wife back to life in exchange. The Huntsman tracks down Snow White, but when Finn reveals that Ravenna does not actually have the power to revive the dead, the Huntsman helps Snow White escape. Finn gathers a band of men to find her, and the Duke and William learn that she is alive. William leaves the castle to find her, joining Finn's band as a [[Archery|bowman]].\n\nThe Huntsman and Snow White leave the Dark Forest, where she saves his life by charming a huge troll that attacks them. They make their way to a fishing village populated by women who have disfigured themselves to make themselves useless to the Queen. The Huntsman learns Snow White's true identity, and leaves her in the care of the women. He returns when he sees the village being burned down by Finn's men. Snow White and the Huntsman evade them and meet a band of [[Seven Dwarfs|eight dwarves]]. The blind dwarf Muir perceives that Snow White is the only person who can defeat Ravenna and end her reign.\n\nAs they travel through a fairy sanctuary, they are attacked by Finn and his men. A battle ensues during which Finn, his men, and one of the dwarfs are killed, while William reveals himself and joins the group on their journey to Hammond's castle. Halfway there, Ravenna disguises herself as William and tempts Snow White into eating a poisoned apple. She flees when the Huntsman and William discover her. William kisses Snow White but she does not wake up (though no one notices the tear that comes from one of her eyes). Her body is taken to Hammond's castle. The Huntsman professes his regret for not being there to save her, as her heart and strength remind him of his late wife, Sara. He kisses her and does not notice a second tear fall from one of her eyes, as his kiss was second of true love needed. Snow White awakens and rallies the Duke's army to mount a siege against Ravenna.\n\nThe dwarves infiltrate the castle through the sewers and open the gates, allowing the Duke's army inside. Snow White confronts Ravenna, but is overpowered. Ravenna is about to kill her when Snow White uses a move the Huntsman taught her and mortally wounds Ravenna, defeating her for good. The kingdom once again enjoys peace and harmony as Snow White is crowned queen.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kristen Stewart]] as [[Snow White]]<ref name=\"TwitterMainCast\">{{cite web|work=[[Twitter]]|url=https://www.twitter.com/universaluk/status/70136430101405697|title=We are pleased to confirm the Snow White and the Huntsman cast will be Kristen Stewart, Charlize Theron, Chris Hemsworth and Sam Claflin|accessdate=July 25, 2011}}</ref>\n** [[Raffey Cassidy]] as young [[Snow White]]\n* [[Chris Hemsworth]] as [[Huntsman (Snow White)|Eric the Huntsman]]\n* [[Charlize Theron]] as [[Queen (Snow White)|Queen Ravenna]], Snow White's evil stepmother\n** [[Izzy Meikle-Small]] as young [[Queen (Snow White)|Ravenna]]\n* [[Sam Claflin]] as [[Prince Charming|William]], son of Duke Hammond\n** Xavier Atkins as young [[Prince Charming|William]]\n* [[Sam Spruell]] as Finn, Ravenna's brother and enforcer\n** Elliot Reeve as young Finn\n* [[Vincent Regan]] as Duke Hammond, William's father\n* [[Lily Cole]] as Greta, a young girl who befriends Snow White\n* [[Noah Huntley]] as [[King (Snow White)|King Magnus]], Snow White's father\n* [[Liberty Ross]] as Queen Eleanor, Snow White's mother\n* [[Chris Obi]] as the voice of [[Magic Mirror (Snow White)|Mirror Man]], the physical form of the Magic Mirror\n* [[Rachael Stirling]] as Anna\n* Hattie Gotobed as Lily\n* [[Greg Hicks]] as Black Knight General\n* [[Peter Ferdinando]] as Black Knight\n* [[Anastasia Hille]] as Ravenna's Mother\n\n===[[Seven Dwarfs|The Dwarfs]]===\nThe Dwarfs were played by actors of average height who had their faces digitally transmuted onto small bodies.
