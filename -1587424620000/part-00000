Some also provide economic local transport. For rail museums, see ''[[List of British railway museums]]''.\n\nMany of the [[standard-gauge]] [[rail transport|railways]] listed, including former branch lines and ex-mainline routes, were closed by [[British Rail]]ways under the [[Beeching Axe]] of the 1960s. Most have been restored and operate as [[Heritage railway|heritage lines]].  A smaller number of lines were formerly [[Industrial railway|industrial]] or colliery railways.\n\nMany of these preserved railways are mentioned in national and international tour guides, and visits may form part of a [[school curriculum]] or feature in other studies, including civil engineering, mechanics, social, economic and political history, visual arts and drama.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n{{TOC

[[Crown dependencies]] whether operational or closed, that are operated for charitable purposes or shareholder profit. Some also provide economic local transport. For rail museums, see ''[[List of British railway museums]]''.\n\nMany of the [[standard-gauge]] [[rail transport|railways]] listed, including former branch lines and ex-mainline routes, were closed by [[British Rail]]ways under the [[Beeching Axe]] of the 1960s. Most have been restored and operate as [[Heritage railway|heritage lines]].  A smaller number of lines were formerly [[Industrial railway|industrial]] or colliery railways.\n\nMany of these preserved railways are mentioned in national and international tour guides, and visits may form part of a [[school curriculum]] or feature in other studies, including civil engineering, mechanics, social, economic and political history, visual arts and drama.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n{{TOC

It was released on his 1975 album ''[[Young Americans]]'' and was later issued as the album's second [[Single (music)|single]] by [[RCA Records]] in July 1975. Written by Bowie, [[Carlos Alomar]] and [[John Lennon]], \nthe song was a major commercial success in North America, becoming Bowie's first number 1 single on both the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and the [[Canadian Singles Chart]]. The song was one of the more successful singles of the year, ranking at number 7 on the [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1975|''Billboard'' Year-End Hot 100]]. However, it was less successful in Europe, reaching number 17 in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. In 1990, Bowie remixed the song under the title \"Fame '90\" to coincide with his [[Sound+Vision Tour]]. \"Fame\" has since appeared on many [[compilation album]]s, and was remastered in 2016 as part of the ''[[Who Can I Be Now? (1974\u20131976)]]'' box set.\n\nThe song is one of four of Bowie's songs to be included in [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll]].\n\n==Background==\nWith the release of his 1972 album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'', Bowie achieved stardom.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=616}} On that album, Bowie presented his aspirations to become famous in \"Star\", which also encapsulated the fantasies of \"every adolescent dreamer miming into a hairbrush in a suburban bedroom\", on top of Bowie's own frustration with not having fulfilled his potential.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=778}} By the beginning of 1975, \"fame\" meant a couple of different things to Bowie. It meant not only his stardom, but also impending lawsuits that were the result of the ending of Bowie's relationship with his manager [[Tony Defries]].{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=276}} It also meant an expensive musical theatre project concocted by Defries, titled ''Fame'', that was financed through MainMan, a company that was built around Bowie's fame; the show was an examination of [[Marilyn Monroe]] that closed after one night on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and after already flopping off-Broadway.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=276}} The failure of ''Fame'' almost ruined MainMan and was traumatic on Bowie and Defries' relationship.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=276}} \n\nBowie would later describe \"Fame\" as \"nasty, angry\", and fully admitted that it was written \"with a degree of malice\" aimed at the MainMan. This is supported by biographer [[Peter Doggett]], who writes: \"every time in \"Fame\" that Bowie snapped back with a cynical retort about its pitfalls, he had [Defries] and [Defries's] epic folly in mind,\" and noted the lyric \"bully for you, chilly for me\" as the striking example.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=276}} In 1990, Bowie recalled the song as his \"least favourite track on the album\"{{Sfn|Pegg|2016|p=257}} and reflected: \"I'd had very upsetting management problems and a lot of that was built into the song. I've left all that behind me, now... I think fame itself is not a rewarding thing.

There, [[Carlos Alomar]] had developed a guitar riff for Bowie's cover of \"Footstompin'\" by [[the Flairs]], which Bowie thought was \"a waste\" to give to a [[cover version|cover]]. Lennon, who was in the studio with them, came up with the hook when he started to sing \"aim\" over the riff, which Bowie turned into \"Fame\" and thereafter, according to [[Marc Spitz]], wrote the rest of the lyrics to the song with Lennon.<ref name=TWRS>{{cite AV media | date=20 May 1990 | title=Timothy White's Rock Stars: Hearing Pictures: David Bowie's Sound + Vision|type=radio interview}}</ref>{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=249}} However, according to Doggett, Lennon made the \"briefest lyrical contributions\" that was \"enough\" to give him co-writing credit.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=275}} Bowie would later say that Lennon was the \"energy\" and the \"inspiration\" for \"Fame\", and that's why he received a co-writing credit.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=256}} Lennon would later contradict this story in a 1980 interview where he said: \"We took some [[Stevie Wonder]] middle eight and did it backwards, you know, and we made a record out of it!\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=275}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=256}} After the group solidified the riff, they emerged with something that was in the hand of \"black American music\" at the start of 1975: a \"cousin\" of \"[[Hollywood Swinging]]\" by [[Kool & the Gang]], \"[[The Payback (song)|The Payback]]\" by [[James Brown]], and \"[[Do It ('Til You're Satisfied)]]\" by [[B. T. Express]].{{sfn|Doggett|2012|pp=275\u2013276}} Doggett writes that other potential influences were the 1972 song \"Jungle Walk\" by [[the Rascals]] and the 1974 songs \"[[Pick Up the Pieces (Average White Band song)|Pick Up the Pieces]]\" by the [[Average White Band]] and \"Brighter Day\" by [[Keith Christmas]], a friend of Bowie's.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=276}} Overall, Doggett believes \"Fame\" resembled \"[[Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)]]\" by [[Sly and the Family Stone]] which, like \"Fame\", is in the funk style with \"viciously pointed\" lyrics.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=277}}\n\n\"Fame\" is a [[funk rock]] song<ref name=\"funk rock\" /> that represents Bowie's (and Lennon's) dissatisfaction with the troubles of fame and stardom, including \"money-grabbing managers, mindless adulation, unwanted entourages and the hollow vacuity of the limousine lifestyle\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=256\u2013257}} Lennon's voice is heard interjecting the falsetto \"Fame\" throughout the song. Doggett found it \"striking\" that the falsetto expanded three octaves, from \"[[Yoko Ono]] soprano\" to \"[[Johnny Cash]] basso profundo\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=277}} Along with \"Fame\", Bowie worked with Lennon again when he decided to record a cover of Lennon's [[The Beatles|Beatles]] song \"[[Across the Universe]]\"; Lennon played rhythm guitar on the cover.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=249}} According to Spitz, \"Fame\" and \"Across the Universe\" were both last-minute additions to ''Young Americans''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=249}} Although ''Young Americans'' was mostly co-produced by [[Tony Visconti]], he was not present at the sessions for \"Fame\";{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=249}} instead, both songs were co-produced by engineer [[Harry Maslin]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Visconti |first=Tony |title=Tony Visconti: the Autobiography: Bowie, Bolan and the Brooklyn Boy |year=2007 |publisher=Harper |pages=222\u2013224}}</ref> In the song, Bowie sings \"What you need, you have to borrow\" with, according to Spitz, the same \"venom\" that [[Jimi Hendrix]] sang, \"Businessmen they drink my wine,\" on his cover of [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[All Along the Watchtower]]\".{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=247}}\n\n==Release and reception==\n\"Fame\" was released on 7 March 1975 as the final track on Bowie's ninth studio album ''[[Young Americans]]''.<ref name=\"UK single liner notes\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=Young Americans|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1975|publisher=[[RCA Records]]|location=US|type=liner notes|id=APK1-0998}}</ref><ref name=\"Erlewine allmusic\">{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title=''Young Americans'' \u2013 David Bowie|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/young-americans-mw0000098919|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=3 February 2020}}</ref> It was subsequently released by RCA Records (as PB 10320) as the second single to the album on 25 July 1975 with fellow album track \"[[Right (David Bowie song)|Right]]\" as the B-side.<ref name=\"UK single liner notes\" /> \"Fame\" became Bowie's biggest hit to that point in the US.

English singer-songwriter [[David Bowie]]. It was released on his 1975 album ''[[Young Americans]]'' and was later issued as the album's second [[Single (music)|single]] by [[RCA Records]] in July 1975. Written by Bowie, [[Carlos Alomar]] and [[John Lennon]], \nthe song was a major commercial success in North America, becoming Bowie's first number 1 single on both the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and the [[Canadian Singles Chart]]. The song was one of the more successful singles of the year, ranking at number 7 on the [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1975|''Billboard'' Year-End Hot 100]]. However, it was less successful in Europe, reaching number 17 in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. In 1990, Bowie remixed the song under the title \"Fame '90\" to coincide with his [[Sound+Vision Tour]]. \"Fame\" has since appeared on many [[compilation album]]s, and was remastered in 2016 as part of the ''[[Who Can I Be Now? (1974\u20131976)]]'' box set.\n\nThe song is one of four of Bowie's songs to be included in [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rockhall.com/exhibits/500-songs-that-shaped-rock-and/ |title=The Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll| website=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|access-date=12 January 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317150057/http://rockhall.com/exhibits/500-songs-that-shaped-rock-and/ |archive-date=17 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nWith the release of his 1972 album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'', Bowie achieved stardom.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=616}} On that album, Bowie presented his aspirations to become famous in \"Star\", which also encapsulated the fantasies of \"every adolescent dreamer miming into a hairbrush in a suburban bedroom\", on top of Bowie's own frustration with not having fulfilled his potential.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=778}} By the beginning of 1975, \"fame\" meant a couple of different things to Bowie. It meant not only his stardom, but also impending lawsuits that were the result of the ending of Bowie's relationship with his manager [[Tony Defries]].{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=276}} It also meant an expensive musical theatre project concocted by Defries, titled ''Fame'', that was financed through MainMan, a company that was built around Bowie's fame; the show was an examination of [[Marilyn Monroe]] that closed after one night on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and after already flopping off-Broadway.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=276}} The failure of ''Fame'' almost ruined MainMan and was traumatic on Bowie and Defries' relationship.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=276}} \n\nBowie would later describe \"Fame\" as \"nasty, angry\", and fully admitted that it was written \"with a degree of malice\" aimed at the MainMan. This is supported by biographer [[Peter Doggett]], who writes: \"every time in \"Fame\" that Bowie snapped back with a cynical retort about its pitfalls, he had [Defries] and [Defries's] epic folly in mind,\" and noted the lyric \"bully for you, chilly for me\" as the striking example.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=276}} In 1990, Bowie recalled the song as his \"least favourite track on the album\"{{Sfn|Pegg|2016|p=257}} and reflected: \"I'd had very upsetting management problems and a lot of that was built into the song. I've left all that behind me, now... I think fame itself is not a rewarding thing. The most you can say is that it gets you a seat in restaurants.\"<ref name=Q90>{{Cite journal| title=David Bowie Interview| journal=[[Q magazine]] |date=April 1990 | pages=60\u201370}}</ref>\n\n==Composition and recording==\n[[File:John Lennon last television interview Tomorrow show 1975 (34 cropped).JPG|thumb|left|150px|alt=John Lennon in 1975|Bowie wrote \"Fame\" with former Beatle [[John Lennon]], who also contributes backing vocals and guitar.]]\nWith the ''[[Young Americans]]'' sessions mostly concluded by late 1974, the material was delayed while Bowie extricated himself from Defries. Sources differ on how \"Fame\" came to be in the studio, but both Doggett and [[Nicholas Pegg]] write that it was the product of \"happy\" accidents.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=275}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=256}} By late 1974, Bowie was staying in [[New York City]], where he met [[John Lennon]], who was in his [[John Lennon#1973\u20131975: \"Lost weekend\"|\"Lost weekend\"]] period of estrangement from his wife [[Yoko Ono]].{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=247}} The pair [[Jam session|jammed]] together, leading to a one-day session at [[Electric Lady Studios]] in January 1975. There, [[Carlos Alomar]] had developed a guitar riff for Bowie's cover of \"Footstompin'\" by [[the Flairs]], which Bowie thought was \"a waste\" to give to a [[cover version|cover]]. Lennon, who was in the studio with them, came up with the hook when he started to sing \"aim\" over the riff, which Bowie turned into \"Fame\" and thereafter, according to [[Marc Spitz]], wrote the rest of the lyrics to the song with Lennon.<ref name=TWRS>{{cite AV media | date=20 May 1990 | title=Timothy White's Rock Stars: Hearing Pictures: David Bowie's Sound + Vision|type=radio interview}}</ref>{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=249}} However, according to Doggett, Lennon made the \"briefest lyrical contributions\" that was \"enough\" to give him co-writing credit.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=275}} Bowie would later say that Lennon was the \"energy\" and the \"inspiration\" for \"Fame\", and that's why he received a co-writing credit.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=256}} Lennon would later contradict this story in a 1980 interview where he said: \"We took some [[Stevie Wonder]] middle eight and did it backwards, you know, and we made a record out of it!\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=275}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=256}} After the group solidified the riff, they emerged with something that was in the hand of \"black American music\" at the start of 1975: a \"cousin\" of \"[[Hollywood Swinging]]\" by [[Kool & the Gang]], \"[[The Payback (song)|The Payback]]\" by [[James Brown]], and \"[[Do It ('Til You're Satisfied)]]\" by [[B. T. Express]].{{sfn|Doggett|2012|pp=275\u2013276}} Doggett writes that other potential influences were the 1972 song \"Jungle Walk\" by [[the Rascals]] and the 1974 songs \"[[Pick Up the Pieces (Average White Band song)|Pick Up the Pieces]]\" by the [[Average White Band]] and \"Brighter Day\" by [[Keith Christmas]], a friend of Bowie's.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=276}} Overall, Doggett believes \"Fame\" resembled \"[[Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)]]\" by [[Sly and the Family Stone]] which, like \"Fame\", is in the funk style with \"viciously pointed\" lyrics.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=277}}\n\n\"Fame\" is a [[funk rock]] song<ref name=\"funk rock\" /> that represents Bowie's (and Lennon's) dissatisfaction with the troubles of fame and stardom, including \"money-grabbing managers, mindless adulation, unwanted entourages and the hollow vacuity of the limousine lifestyle\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=256\u2013257}} Lennon's voice is heard interjecting the falsetto \"Fame\" throughout the song. Doggett found it \"striking\" that the falsetto expanded three octaves, from \"[[Yoko Ono]] soprano\" to \"[[Johnny Cash]] basso profundo\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=277}} Along with \"Fame\", Bowie worked with Lennon again when he decided to record a cover of Lennon's [[The Beatles|Beatles]] song \"[[Across the Universe]]\"; Lennon played rhythm guitar on the cover.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=249}} According to Spitz, \"Fame\" and \"Across the Universe\" were both last-minute additions to ''Young Americans''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=249}} Although ''Young Americans'' was mostly co-produced by [[Tony Visconti]], he was not present at the sessions for \"Fame\";{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=249}} instead, both songs were co-produced by engineer [[Harry Maslin]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Visconti |first=Tony |title=Tony Visconti: the Autobiography: Bowie, Bolan and the Brooklyn Boy |year=2007 |publisher=Harper |pages=222\u2013224}}</ref> In the song, Bowie sings \"What you need, you have to borrow\" with, according to Spitz, the same \"venom\" that [[Jimi Hendrix]] sang, \"Businessmen they drink my wine,\" on his cover of [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[All Along the Watchtower]]\".{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=247}}\n\n==Release and reception==\n\"Fame\" was released on 7 March 1975 as the final track on Bowie's ninth studio album ''[[Young Americans]]''.<ref name=\"UK single liner notes\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=Young Americans|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1975|publisher=[[RCA Records]]|location=US|type=liner notes|id=APK1-0998}}</ref><ref name=\"Erlewine allmusic\">{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title=''Young Americans'' \u2013 David Bowie|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/young-americans-mw0000098919|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=3 February 2020}}</ref> It was subsequently released by RCA Records (as PB 10320) as the second single to the album on 25 July 1975 with fellow album track \"[[Right (David Bowie song)|Right]]\" as the B-side.<ref name=\"UK single liner notes\" /> \"Fame\" became Bowie's biggest hit to that point in the US. It was his first number one hit on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, as well as his first to break the top 10, but would only reach number 17 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].

The division, which was activated on 1 October 1941 in Hawaii, conducts military operations primarily in the [[Asia-Pacific]] region. Its present deployment is composed of [[Stryker]], light infantry, airborne, and aviation units. Tropic Lightning Soldiers serve as the premier Army response force for the U.S. Pacific Command, and regularly train with other U.S. military branches to practice and maintain joint operations capabilities. The climate and terrain of the Pacific region demands Tropic Lightning Soldiers be able to operate in physically demanding and harsh environments. In 2014, the division opened the Jungle Operations Training Center\u2014the first such school in the Army since the closing of the old Jungle Warfare School at Fort Sherman, Panama Canal Zone. Joint operations and training with partner states herald a new chapter in the history of Tropic Lightning\u2014America's Pacific Division.\n\nThe division was originally activated from Hawaii garrison units during [[World War II]], slightly more than a month before the Japanese [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]] began the [[Pacific War]]. After spending almost a year training, it fought in the Allied counteroffensive during the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]] from December 1942, helping to end organized Japanese resistance on that island by early February 1943. The 25th spent a period garrisoning the island, then moved on to fight in the [[New Georgia Campaign]] in July. After the Japanese defeat in the latter it was sent to New Zealand later that year for rest and training, before moving to New Caledonia for further training. The division returned to combat in the January 1945 [[Battle of Luzon|Invasion of Luzon]], reducing Japanese resistance on the island until late June, after which it was pulled out of the line for training. The division then served in the [[Occupation of Japan]] after the surrender of the latter from September 1945.\n\nWhen the [[Korean War]] began in June 1950, the division was deployed to Korea, where it fought in the defense of and the breakout from the [[Battle of Pusan Perimeter|Pusan Perimeter]] in mid-1950, with elements advancing as far as the [[Yalu River]] in November. After being thrown back by the Chinese Communist intervention in the war, the division eventually took up positions south of [[Osan]]. It participated in a series of United Nations counteroffensives in early 1951, then fought in a [[Korean War#Stalemate (July 1951 \u2013 July 1953)|stalemate]] close to the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]] from the middle of the year. The division defended Seoul against Chinese Communist attack from May 1953 to the July [[Korean Armistice Agreement|armistice]], returning to Hawaii in late 1954.\n\nAfter undergoing major reorganizations in 1957 and 1963 to adapt to changing tactics, the division deployed to [[South Vietnam]] to fight in the [[Vietnam War]] between late 1965 and early 1966. The 25th served in Vietnam until its withdrawal back to Hawaii in 1970\u20131971, participating in [[Operation Attleboro]], [[Operation Cedar Falls]], [[Operation Junction City]], the [[Battle of Saigon (1968)|Battle of Saigon]] during the North Vietnamese [[Tet Offensive]], and the [[Cambodian Incursion]]. It was reorganized as a [[light infantry]] division in 1985, and elements have participated in the [[Iraq War]] and the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Lineage===\nSources:<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/lineages/branches/div/025idhqbn.htm |title=Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion, 25th Infantry Division; Lineage and Honors |publisher=U.S. Army Center of Military History |date=26 August 2014 |accessdate=26 January 2015}}</ref>\n<ref name=Wilson1999>{{cite book\n |last=Wilson|first=John B.\n |title=Armies, Corps, Divisions, and Separate Brigades\n |publisher=[[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]] |page=295\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tGAarOMP5VMC&pg=PA295&dq=25th+Infantry+Division+1+april+1960&hl=en&sa=X&ei=n96NUIvCBa2v0AHgt4CQCg&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=25th%20Infantry%20Division%201%20april%201960&f=false\n  |accessdate=29 October 2012 |date=25 August 1999 |series=Army Lineage Series |lccn=98-52151\n  |isbn=0-16-049992-5}}</ref>\n\n* Constituted 26 August 1941 in the [[Army of the United States]] as Headquarters, 25th Infantry Division, based on a [[En cadre|Cadre]] Force from the former [[Hawaiian Division]].\n* Activated 1 October 1941 at [[Schofield Barracks]], Hawaii\n* Allotted 27 June 1949 to the [[Regular Army (United States)|Regular Army]]\n* Division headquarters reorganized and redesignated 1 April 1960 as [[Headquarters and Headquarters Company]], 25th Infantry Division\n* Reorganized and redesignated 16 November 2005 as Headquarters and Tactical Command Posts, 25th Infantry Division\n* Reorganized and redesignated 16 January 2010 as Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion, 25th Infantry Division\n\nThe 25th Division was formed from the [[27th Infantry Regiment (United States)|27th]] and [[35th Infantry Regiment (United States)|35th Infantry regiment]]s of the original [[Hawaiian Division (United States)|Hawaiian Division]]\u2212 a pre\u2013[[World War II]] composed of two brigades with four infantry regiments. The remaining units of the Hawaiian Division were reorganized as the [[US 24th Infantry Division|24th Infantry Division]]. These steps, part of the [[Triangular division]] organization, were undertaken to provide more flexibility with direct division control of three regiments.\n\n===Pacific War===\n[[File:UPushuMaru.jpg|thumb|left|225px|U.S. Army soldiers push supplies up the Matanikau River to support the 25th Infantry Division's offensive on [[Guadalcanal]] in January 1943.]]\nAfter the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese air attack]] on [[Schofield Barracks]] on 7 December 1941, the 25th Infantry Division moved to beach positions for the defense of [[Honolulu]] and [[Ewa Point]].\nFollowing intensive training, the 25th began moving to [[Guadalcanal]], 25 November 1942, to relieve Marines near [[Henderson Field (Guadalcanal)|Henderson Field]]. First elements landed near the [[Tenaru River]], 17 December 1942, and entered combat, 10 January 1943, participating in the seizure of [[Kokumbona]] and the reduction of the [[Battle of Mount Austen, the Galloping Horse, and the Sea Horse|Mount Austen Pocket]] in some of the bitterest fighting of the Pacific campaign. The threat of large enemy attacks caused a temporary withdrawal, but Division elements under [[XIV Corps (United States)|XIV Corps]] control relieved the [[147th Infantry Regiment (United States)|147th Infantry]] and took over the advance on [[Cape Esperance]]. The junction of these elements with [[Americal Division]] forces near the cape, 5 February 1943, ended organized enemy resistance.\n\nA period of garrison duty followed, ending 21 July: On that date, advance elements debarked on [[Munda (Solomon Islands)|Munda]], [[New Georgia]]. The 25th Infantry, under the Northern Landing Force, took part in the capture of [[Vella Lavella]], 15 August to 15 September 1943. Meanwhile, other elements landed on [[New Georgia]], took [[Zieta]], marched through jungle mud for 19 days, and captured [[Bairoko Harbor]], winning the island. Elements cleared [[Arundel Island]], 24 September 1943, and [[Kolombangara]] island with its important [[Vila, Solomon Islands|Vila Airport]], 6 October. Organized resistance on [[New Georgia]] ended, 25 August, and the division moved to New Zealand for rest and training, last elements arriving on 5 December. The 25th was transferred to [[New Caledonia]], 3 February-14 March 1944, for continued training.\n\nThe division landed in the [[San Fabian]] area of [[Luzon]] on 11 January 1945 to enter the struggle for the liberation of the [[Philippines]]. It drove across the [[Luzon Central Plain]], meeting the enemy at [[Binalonan]], 17 January. Moving through the rice paddies, the 25th occupied [[Umingan]], [[Lupao]], and [[San Jose City, Nueva Ecija|San Jose]] and destroyed a great part of the Japanese armor on Luzon. On 21 February, the division began operations in the [[Caraballo Mountains]]. It fought its way along Highway No. 5, taking [[Digdig]], [[Putlan]], and [[Kapintalan]] against fierce Japanese counterattacks and took [[Balete Pass]], 13 May, and opened the gateway to the [[Cagayan Valley]], 27 May, with the capture of Santa Fe. Until 30 June, when the division was relieved, it carried out mopping-up activities. On 1 July, the division moved to [[Tarlac]] for training, leaving for Japan, 20 September.\n\n{{Infobox command structure\n|name=25th Infantry Division\n|date=1942-1945\n|parent=[[United States Army Pacific]] \n|subordinate=\n* Headquarters, 25th Infantry Division\n* [[27th Infantry Regiment (United States)|27th Infantry Regiment]]\n* [[35th Infantry Regiment (United States)|35th Infantry Regiment]]\n* [[161st Infantry Regiment (United States)|161st Infantry Regiment]]\n* 65th Engineer Combat Battalion\n* 25th Medical Battalion\n* 25th Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop (Mechanized)\n* Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 25th Infantry Division Artillery\n** [[8th Field Artillery Regiment|8th Field Artillery Battalion]] ([[M101 howitzer|105 mm]])\n** 64th Field Artillery Battalion (105 mm)\n** 89th Field Artillery Battalion (105 mm)\n** 90th Field Artillery Battalion ([[M114 155 mm howitzer|155 mm]])\n* Headquarters, Special Troops, 25th Infantry Division\n** 25th Signal Company\n** 725th Ordnance Light Maintenance Company\n** 25th Quartermaster Company\n** Military Police Platoon\n** Band\n* 25th Counterintelligence Corps Detachment\n}}\n\n====Casualties====\n\n*'''Total battle casualties:''' 5,432<ref name=\"Adjutant General 1953\">Army Battle Casualties and Nonbattle Deaths, Final Report (Statistical and Accounting Branch\nOffice of the Adjutant General, 1 June 1953)</ref>\n\n*'''Killed in action:''' 1,236<ref name=\"Adjutant General 1953\"/>\n*'''Wounded in action:''' 4,190<ref name=\"Adjutant General 1953\"/>\n*'''Missing in action:''' 4<ref name=\"Adjutant General 1953\"/>\n*'''Prisoner of war:''' 2<ref name=\"Adjutant General 1953\"/>\nThe division's rapid movements during its campaigns led to the adoption of the nickname \"Tropic Lightning\".

Acting under [[United Nations Command (Korea)|United Nations]] (UN) orders, the Division moved from its base in Japan to Korea between 5\u201318 July 1950 to join the [[Eighth United States Army]]. The division, then under the command of Major General [[William B. Kean]], successfully completed its first mission by blocking the approaches to the port city [[Pusan]]. For this action, the Division received its first [[Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation]]. The division participated in the [[Pusan Perimeter Offensive|breakout from the Pusan perimeter]] commencing on 16 September and Eighth Army then [[UN September 1950 counteroffensive|began a general offensive northward]] against crumbling KPA opposition to establish contact with forces of the [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th Infantry Division]] driving southward from the [[Battle of Inchon|Inchon beachhead]]. Major elements of the KPA were destroyed and cut off in this aggressive penetration; the link-up was effected south of [[Suwon]] on 26 September. On 23 September the Division was assigned to the newly activated US [[IX Corps (United States)|IX Corps]]. The UN offensive was continued northwards, past [[Seoul]], and across the 38th Parallel [[UN offensive into North Korea|into North Korea]] on 1 October. The momentum of the attack was maintained, and the race to the North Korean capital, [[Pyongyang]], ended on 19 October when elements of the [[Republic of Korea Army]] (ROK) [[1st Infantry Division (South Korea)|1st Infantry Division]] and US [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]] [[Battle of Pyongyang (1950)|captured the city]]. The advance continued, but against unexpectedly stiffening resistance. The Chinese [[People's Volunteer Army]] (PVA) entered the war on the side of North Korea, making their [[UN offensive into North Korea#Chinese First Phase Campaign (25 October-6 November)|first attacks]] in late October. The UN forces renewed their offensive on 24 November before being stopped by the PVA [[Second Phase Offensive]] starting on 25 November. The division was forced to carry out a systematic withdrawal and ordered to take up defensive positions on the south bank of the [[Chongchon River]] on 30 November 1950. Eventually, these lines failed and Eighth Army suffering heavy casualties, ordered a [[UN retreat from North Korea|complete withdrawal]] to the [[Imjin River]], near the 38th Parallel.\n\nAfter a month and a half of planning and reorganization, a [[Operation Thunderbolt (1951)|new offensive]] was launched on 25 January 1951, and succeeded in recapturing [[Inchon]] and [[Gimpo International Airport|Kimpo Air Base]]. This was the first of several successful assaults on the PVA/KPA. The division next participated in [[Operation Ripper]], during which it drove the PVA across the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]]. Success continued with Operations [[Operation Dauntless|Dauntless]] and [[UN May\u2013June 1951 counteroffensive#Operation Piledriver|Piledriver]] in early 1951. These offensives secured part of the [[Iron Triangle (Korea)|Iron Triangle]] which enhanced the UN's bargaining position. With leaders of four nations now at the negotiating tables in the summer of 1951, Division activity slowed to patrol and defensive actions to maintain the line of resistance. This type of action continued into the winter of 1952. In January 1953 the Division was transferred from IX Corps to [[I Corps (United States)|I Corps]] and assumed the responsibility of guarding the approaches of Seoul on 5 May 1953. 23 days later, when ceasefire negotiations at Panmunjom stalled, a heavy PVA assault hit the [[Battle of the Nevada Complex|Nevada Complex]], the Division held its ground; the brunt of the attack was absorbed by the attached [[Turkish Brigade]] and the [[14th Infantry Regiment (United States)|14th Infantry Regiment]]. By successfully defending Seoul from continued attack from May to July 1953, the division earned its second Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation. Again negotiators moved toward peace. In July, the division again moved to reserve status at [[Camp Casey, South Korea|Camp Casey]] where it remained through the signing of the armistice 27 July 1953. Fourteen division soldiers were awarded Medals of Honor during the Korean War, making the division one of the most decorated US Army divisions of that war.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nThe division's 14th Infantry Regiment had three recipients of the [[Medal of Honor]], [[Donn F. Porter]], [[Ernest E. West]] and [[Bryant E. Womack]]. The [[24th Infantry Regiment (United States)|24th Infantry Regiment]] had two recipients, [[Cornelius H. Charlton]] and [[William Thompson (Medal of Honor, 1950)|William Thompson]]. The [[35th Infantry Regiment (United States)|35th Infantry Regiment]] had three recipients, [[William R. Jecelin]], [[Billie G. Kanell]] and [[Donald R. Moyer]]. Finally, the [[27th Infantry Regiment (United States)|27th Infantry Regiment]] had five recipients, [[John W. Collier]], [[Reginald B. Desiderio]], [[Benito Martinez (Medal of Honor)|Benito Martinez]], [[Lewis L. Millett]] and [[Jerome A. Sudut]]. The divisions patch is sometimes referred to as the \"Electric Strawberry\".\n\nThe division remained in Korea until 1954 and returned to Hawaii from September through October of that year. After a 12-year absence, the 25th Infantry Division had finally returned home.\n\n{{Infobox command structure\n|name=25th Infantry Division\n|date=1955\n|parent=[[United States Army Pacific]] \n|subordinate=\n* 14th Infantry Regiment\n*27th Infantry Regiment\n*35th Infantry Regiment\n**(each regiment had:\n**three Infantry Battalions, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd\n**Service Company\n**Medical Company\n**Heavy Mortar Company\n**Tank Company)\n* Division Artillery\n**8th Artillery Battalion (105T)\n**64th Artillery Battalion (105T)\n**69th Artillery Battalion (105T)\n**90th Artillery Battalion (155T)\n* Division Trains\n**25th Quartermaster Company\n**25th Medical Battalion\n**725th Ordnance Battalion\n* Division Troops\n**25th Aviation Company\n**25th Reconnaissance Company\n**89th Tank Battalion\n** 65th Engineer Battalion\n** 125th Signal Company\n** 25th Military Intelligence Company\n** 25th Replacement Company\n** 25th Finance Company\n** 25th Military Police Company\n**25th Inf Div Band\n}}\nOn 1 February 1957, the division was reorganized as a [[Pentomic]] Division.  The division's three infantry regiments (the [[14th Infantry Regiment (United States)|14th]], [[27th Infantry Regiment (United States)|27th]] and [[35th Infantry Regiment (United States)|35th]]) were inactivated, with their elements reorganized into five infantry battle groups (the [[14th Infantry Regiment (United States)|1-14 IN]], [[27th Infantry Regiment (United States)|1-27 IN]], [[35th Infantry Regiment (United States)|1-35 IN]], [[19th Infantry Regiment (United States)|2-19 IN]] and the [[21st Infantry Regiment (United States)|2-21 IN]]).\n\nIn August 1963, the division was reorganized as a [[Reorganization Objective Army Division]] (ROAD).  Three Brigade Headquarters were activated and Infantry units were reorganized into battalions.\n\n===Vietnam War===\n[[File:Tank-saigon.gif|thumb|225px|Tank from 1st Battalion, 69th Armor, 25th Infantry Division, moves through Saigon shortly after disembarking from LST at Saigon Harbor, 12 March 1966]]\nIn response to a request from the U.S. Military Assistance Command in [[Vietnam]], the division sent 100 helicopter [[door-gunner]]s to [[South Vietnam]] in early 1963. By August 1965, further division involvement in the coming Vietnam War included the deployment of Company C, [[65th Engineer Battalion]], to South Vietnam to assist in the construction of port facilities at [[Cam Ranh Bay]]. By mid-1965, 2,200 men of the Tropic Lightning Division were involved in Vietnam. The division was again ordered to contribute combat forces in December of that year. Its resupply regiment, the 467th, was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel George S Dotson through the end of the war.\n\nIn response to a [[MACV]] request, the division deployed the 3rd Brigade, a Reinforced Task Force, with 5,150 infantrymen and 9,000 tons of equipment from Hawaii in 25 days to the Northwest sector of South Vietnam to firmly establish a fortified enclave from which the division could operate. [[Operation Blue Light]] was the largest and longest airlift of personnel and cargo into a combat zone in military history before [[Operation Desert Shield]]. The brigade deployed its first soldiers from [[Hickam Air Force Base]], Honolulu, to the central highlands at [[Pleiku]]. These men arrived in Vietnam 24 December 1965. By mid-January, the deployment operation was complete&nbsp;\u2014 giving combat planners in Vietnam a favorable balance of power. The 25th Infantry Division had its headquarters at [[C\u1ee7 Chi Base Camp]], near the [[Iron Triangle (Vietnam)|Iron Triangle]] from January 1966 until February 1970. The division was heavily engaged from April 1966 until 1972 throughout the area of operations in Southeast Asia. During this period, Tropic Lightning soldiers fought in some of the toughest battles of the war including [[Operation Junction City]].\n\nDuring the [[Tet offensive]]s of 1968 and [[Tet 1969|1969]], Tropic Lightning soldiers were instrumental in defending the besieged city of [[Saigon]].  From May through June 1970, division soldiers participated in Allied thrusts deep into enemy sanctuaries located in [[Cambodia]]. In these [[Cambodian Incursion|Incursion]] operations, the division units confiscated thousands of tons of supplies and hundreds of weapons. This operation crippled the Cambodian-based efforts against American units. Following its return from Cambodia to South Vietnam, the division resumed its place in the [[Vietnamization]] Program. The war was winding down. By late December 1970, elements of the 25th Infantry Division were able to begin redeployment to [[Schofield Barracks]]. Second Brigade was the last element of the division to depart Vietnam. It arrived at Ft Lewis, Washington in the early days of May 1971. Some elements in the 2nd Brigade were originally assigned to the 4th Infantry Division when they arrived in Vietnam. During the war in Vietnam, 22 [[Medal of Honor|Medals of Honor]] were awarded to Tropic Lightning soldiers.\n\n===Reorganization and light infantry status===\nAfter its return to Schofield Barracks, the 25th Infantry Division remained the only Army division to have never been stationed in the continental United States. In a time of overall military downsizing, it was reduced to a single brigade numbering 4,000 men. The division was reactivated in March 1972. It was reorganized to include as a \"roundout\" brigade the [[29th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (United States)|29th Infantry Brigade]] of the [[Hawaii Army National Guard]] which included: the [[299th Infantry Regiment (United States)|2nd Battalion, 299th Infantry]], Hawaii Army National Guard; [[100th Infantry Battalion (United States)|100th Battalion]], [[442nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|442d Infantry]], US Army Reserve; and the 1st Battalion, [[184th Infantry Regiment (United States)|184th Infantry]] [[California Army National Guard]]. Now reorganized, the 25th Infantry Division trained for the next eight years throughout the Pacific Theater and continued to improve its combat capabilities with troop deployment varying in size from squads, who participated in training missions with Fijian forces, to exercises as large as [[Team Spirit]], where more than 5,000 divisional troops and 1,700 pieces of equipment were airlifted to South Korea for this annual exercise.\n\n[[File:25th US Infantry Division 1989.png|thumb|480px|25th US Infantry Division 1989]]\nIn 1985, the division began its reorganization from a conventional infantry division to a [[light infantry]] division. The four primary characteristics of this new light infantry division were to be: mission flexibility, rapid deployment and combat readiness at 100 percent strength with a Pacific Basin orientation. Major configuration changes included the addition of a third infantry brigade, an additional direct-support artillery battalion and the expansion of the combat aviation battalion to a brigade-sized unit. With the transfer of large quantities of heavy equipment, the 25th Infantry Division earned the designation \"light\"&nbsp;\u2014 the reorganization was completed by 1 October 1986. Training became more sophisticated and more intense. In 1988, the division's first battalions participated in rotations at the [[Fort Chaffee|Joint Readiness Training Center]], [[Fort Chaffee]], Arkansas. This training center provides the most realistic training available to light forces in the Army. Coupled with joint/combined training exercises [[Cobra Gold]] in Thailand, [[Exercise Kangaroo|Kangaroo]] in Australia and [[Orient Shield]] in Japan, the division's demanding exercise schedule significantly increased the division's fighting capabilities. Until 1993 Operation Team Spirit in Korea remained the division's largest annual maneuver exercise, involving more than half of the division's strength.\n\n===Desert Storm and the Post-Cold War era===\nNot many of the division's units participated in [[Operation Desert Storm]], due to the division being earmarked for Pacific contingencies, such as a renewal of hostilities in Korea. However, during the [[Gulf War]], one platoon each from Companies A, B and C, 4th Battalion, 27th Infantry, deployed to [[Saudi Arabia]] in January 1991. These Tropic Lightning soldiers were scheduled to be replacement squads in the ground campaign; however, after observing their performance in desert warfare training, the Assistant Commander of Third U.S. Army asked for them to become the security force for the Army's forward headquarters. In that role, the Wolfhound platoons were alerted and attached to Third Army (Forward) into [[Kuwait City]] 26 February, where they secured the headquarters area and conducted mop-up operations in the city and its adjacent mine fields. Company A's platoon was separated from the other Wolfhounds following that battle to accompany General [[Norman Schwarzkopf, Jr.|H. Norman Schwarzkopf]] into Iraq 1 March 1991 to provide security at the truce signing. The three platoons returned to Schofield Barracks without casualties on 20 March 1991.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\nIn 1995, the division underwent another reorganization and reduction as a part of the Army's downsizing. First Brigade and its direct support units were inactivated and moved to [[Fort Lewis]], Washington, where they were again reactivated as a detached brigade of the 25th Infantry Division (Light). In early 2005, an airborne brigade was created at [[Fort Richardson (Alaska)|Fort Richardson]], Alaska and added to the 25th. Today the division is composed of the 1st and 2nd Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (based in [[Fort Wainwright]], Alaska and [[Schofield Barracks]], Hawaii, respectively), the 3rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team (Schofield Barracks) and The 4th Airborne Brigade Combat Team (based at Fort Richardson, Alaska), in addition to the [[Combat Aviation Brigade]], a division support command and a complement of separate battalions. As a major ground reserve force for the U.S. Pacific Command, the \"Tropic Lightning\" Division routinely deploys from Schofield Barracks to participate in exercises in Japan, [[Korea]], Thailand, the [[Philippines]], Australia and the Big Island of Hawaii.\n\n===Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan===\n[[File:DA-SD-06-03422.JPG|thumb|left|220px|A sniper from the 25th Infantry Division on patrol in Mosul, Iraq.]]\n\nThe division did not take part in the fighting in [[Afghanistan]] and Iraq from 2001\u20132003. However, in early 2004, units from the division deployed to Iraq to take part in the combat operations of that country. The 2d Brigade deployed in January 2004 to Iraq and returned to Schofield Barracks in February of the following year. The 3d Brigade, 25th Infantry Division began deploying to Afghanistan in March 2004. The first element to deploy was 2d Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment (\"Wolfhounds\"). They were accompanied by Battery B, 3d Battalion, [[7th Field Artillery Regiment (United States)|7th Field Artillery Regiment]]. The Wolfhounds operated in the volatile Paktika Province on the border with Pakistan in the Waziristan region. The 25th Infantry Division redeployed to Schofield Barracks Hawaii in April 2005.\n[[File:Army Spc Richard Burton 25th CAB.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Army Spc. Richard Burton, crew chief with the 25th Infantry Division, provides security in a Black Hawk helicopter during a flight mission over Afghanistan's Kandahar province, 26 Nov. 2012.]]\nThe 25th Infantry Division is recognized for the first successful free democratic elections in Afghanistan on 9 October 2004. One of the missions of the 25th Infantry Division was to track down insurgent Taliban and Al-Qaeda members in the mountainous terrain of Afghanistan. In July 2005, a 4th Brigade was added to the 25th Infantry Division as an airborne brigade stationed in Fort Richardson, Alaska. It deployed in October 2006 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The 2d Brigade began its transformation as a [[Stryker]] [[Brigade combat team|Brigade Combat Team]] while the 3d Brigade began its transformation as a unit of action (UA) in the same year. The (Light) status was dropped from the division name in January 2006. On 15 December 2006 the [[172nd Infantry Brigade (United States)|172d Infantry Brigade]] was reflagged as the 1st BCT, 25th Infantry Division; concurrently, the former 1st BCT (Stryker) at Fort Lewis, Washington was reflagged as the 2d Cavalry Regiment (Stryker) and moved to Vilseck, Germany.\n\nFrom 2007 through 2009 elements of the 25th, including the 1/21 \"Gimlets\" from Schofield served in Iraq in the vicinity of Baghdad, serving proudly and at great cost. Beginning in 2005 the 2nd Brigade including the 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry underwent reorganization from light to a Stryker brigade combat team. The brigade arrived in Iraq for a fifteen-month tour of duty in November 2007 and was based at Camp Taji northwest of Baghdad. Serving with the Multi-National Division-Baghdad, the brigade was responsible for the rural areas northwest and west of Baghdad with the 1st Battalion operating near Abu Ghuraib. The 1st Battalion, working closely with their Iraqi counterparts, was especially successful in eliminating terrorist cells and uncovering and destroying multiple weapons caches. Select elements of 1st Battalion 21st Infantry, including Alpha Company, participated in the Battle of Sadr City in March 2008. The 1st Battalion returned to Schofield Barracks in February 2009.\n\nAs of March 2009, the 1st BCT, 2d BCT, and 3d BCT were deployed to [[Iraq]] in support of [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] while the 4th BCT deployed to [[Afghanistan]] in support of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]].\n\nIn June\u2013August 2009, elements of the 25th Division participated in [[Operation Champion Sword]].<ref>\n[http://www.usarak.army.mil/alaskapost/Archives2009/090807/Aug07Story17.asp Operation Champion Sword] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922021449/http://www.usarak.army.mil/alaskapost/Archives2009/090807/Aug07Story17.asp |date=22 September 2015 }} {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922021449/http://www.usarak.army.mil/alaskapost/Archives2009/090807/Aug07Story17.asp |date=22 September 2015 }}, ''Alaska Post'', Volume 16, Number 31, 7 August 2009.

On 18 December 2011 the Division Headquarters completed its retrograde, training and security mission and redeployed back to Schofield Barracks Hawaii.\n\nIn April 2011, the 25th's 3d Brigade Combat Team assumed control of the most hostile area of Afghanistan, Regional Command East. A few months later the 1st Brigade deployed to RC-South. 4ABCT followed, deploying in late 2011 for a 12-month deployment.

The division, which was activated on 1 October 1941 in Hawaii, conducts military operations primarily in the [[Asia-Pacific]] region. Its present deployment is composed of [[Stryker]], light infantry, airborne, and aviation units. Tropic Lightning Soldiers serve as the premier Army response force for the U.S. Pacific Command, and regularly train with other U.S. military branches to practice and maintain joint operations capabilities. The climate and terrain of the Pacific region demands Tropic Lightning Soldiers be able to operate in physically demanding and harsh environments. In 2014, the division opened the Jungle Operations Training Center\u2014the first such school in the Army since the closing of the old Jungle Warfare School at Fort Sherman, Panama Canal Zone. Joint operations and training with partner states herald a new chapter in the history of Tropic Lightning\u2014America's Pacific Division.\n\nThe division was originally activated from Hawaii garrison units during [[World War II]], slightly more than a month before the Japanese [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]] began the [[Pacific War]]. After spending almost a year training, it fought in the Allied counteroffensive during the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]] from December 1942, helping to end organized Japanese resistance on that island by early February 1943. The 25th spent a period garrisoning the island, then moved on to fight in the [[New Georgia Campaign]] in July. After the Japanese defeat in the latter it was sent to New Zealand later that year for rest and training, before moving to New Caledonia for further training. The division returned to combat in the January 1945 [[Battle of Luzon|Invasion of Luzon]], reducing Japanese resistance on the island until late June, after which it was pulled out of the line for training. The division then served in the [[Occupation of Japan]] after the surrender of the latter from September 1945.\n\nWhen the [[Korean War]] began in June 1950, the division was deployed to Korea, where it fought in the defense of and the breakout from the [[Battle of Pusan Perimeter|Pusan Perimeter]] in mid-1950, with elements advancing as far as the [[Yalu River]] in November. After being thrown back by the Chinese Communist intervention in the war, the division eventually took up positions south of [[Osan]]. It participated in a series of United Nations counteroffensives in early 1951, then fought in a [[Korean War#Stalemate (July 1951 \u2013 July 1953)|stalemate]] close to the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]] from the middle of the year. The division defended Seoul against Chinese Communist attack from May 1953 to the July [[Korean Armistice Agreement|armistice]], returning to Hawaii in late 1954.\n\nAfter undergoing major reorganizations in 1957 and 1963 to adapt to changing tactics, the division deployed to [[South Vietnam]] to fight in the [[Vietnam War]] between late 1965 and early 1966. The 25th served in Vietnam until its withdrawal back to Hawaii in 1970\u20131971, participating in [[Operation Attleboro]], [[Operation Cedar Falls]], [[Operation Junction City]], the [[Battle of Saigon (1968)|Battle of Saigon]] during the North Vietnamese [[Tet Offensive]], and the [[Cambodian Incursion]]. It was reorganized as a [[light infantry]] division in 1985, and elements have participated in the [[Iraq War]] and the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Lineage===\nSources:<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/lineages/branches/div/025idhqbn.htm |title=Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion, 25th Infantry Division; Lineage and Honors |publisher=U.S. Army Center of Military History |date=26 August 2014 |accessdate=26 January 2015}}</ref>\n<ref name=Wilson1999>{{cite book\n |last=Wilson|first=John B.\n |title=Armies, Corps, Divisions, and Separate Brigades\n |publisher=[[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]] |page=295\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tGAarOMP5VMC&pg=PA295&dq=25th+Infantry+Division+1+april+1960&hl=en&sa=X&ei=n96NUIvCBa2v0AHgt4CQCg&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=25th%20Infantry%20Division%201%20april%201960&f=false\n  |accessdate=29 October 2012 |date=25 August 1999 |series=Army Lineage Series |lccn=98-52151\n  |isbn=0-16-049992-5}}</ref>\n\n* Constituted 26 August 1941 in the [[Army of the United States]] as Headquarters, 25th Infantry Division, based on a [[En cadre|Cadre]] Force from the former [[Hawaiian Division]].\n* Activated 1 October 1941 at [[Schofield Barracks]], Hawaii\n* Allotted 27 June 1949 to the [[Regular Army (United States)|Regular Army]]\n* Division headquarters reorganized and redesignated 1 April 1960 as [[Headquarters and Headquarters Company]], 25th Infantry Division\n* Reorganized and redesignated 16 November 2005 as Headquarters and Tactical Command Posts, 25th Infantry Division\n* Reorganized and redesignated 16 January 2010 as Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion, 25th Infantry Division\n\nThe 25th Division was formed from the [[27th Infantry Regiment (United States)|27th]] and [[35th Infantry Regiment (United States)|35th Infantry regiment]]s of the original [[Hawaiian Division (United States)|Hawaiian Division]]\u2212 a pre\u2013[[World War II]] composed of two brigades with four infantry regiments. The remaining units of the Hawaiian Division were reorganized as the [[US 24th Infantry Division|24th Infantry Division]]. These steps, part of the [[Triangular division]] organization, were undertaken to provide more flexibility with direct division control of three regiments.\n\n===Pacific War===\n[[File:UPushuMaru.jpg|thumb|left|225px|U.S. Army soldiers push supplies up the Matanikau River to support the 25th Infantry Division's offensive on [[Guadalcanal]] in January 1943.]]\nAfter the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese air attack]] on [[Schofield Barracks]] on 7 December 1941, the 25th Infantry Division moved to beach positions for the defense of [[Honolulu]] and [[Ewa Point]].\nFollowing intensive training, the 25th began moving to [[Guadalcanal]], 25 November 1942, to relieve Marines near [[Henderson Field (Guadalcanal)|Henderson Field]]. First elements landed near the [[Tenaru River]], 17 December 1942, and entered combat, 10 January 1943, participating in the seizure of [[Kokumbona]] and the reduction of the [[Battle of Mount Austen, the Galloping Horse, and the Sea Horse|Mount Austen Pocket]] in some of the bitterest fighting of the Pacific campaign. The threat of large enemy attacks caused a temporary withdrawal, but Division elements under [[XIV Corps (United States)|XIV Corps]] control relieved the [[147th Infantry Regiment (United States)|147th Infantry]] and took over the advance on [[Cape Esperance]]. The junction of these elements with [[Americal Division]] forces near the cape, 5 February 1943, ended organized enemy resistance.\n\nA period of garrison duty followed, ending 21 July: On that date, advance elements debarked on [[Munda (Solomon Islands)|Munda]], [[New Georgia]]. The 25th Infantry, under the Northern Landing Force, took part in the capture of [[Vella Lavella]], 15 August to 15 September 1943. Meanwhile, other elements landed on [[New Georgia]], took [[Zieta]], marched through jungle mud for 19 days, and captured [[Bairoko Harbor]], winning the island. Elements cleared [[Arundel Island]], 24 September 1943, and [[Kolombangara]] island with its important [[Vila, Solomon Islands|Vila Airport]], 6 October. Organized resistance on [[New Georgia]] ended, 25 August, and the division moved to New Zealand for rest and training, last elements arriving on 5 December. The 25th was transferred to [[New Caledonia]], 3 February-14 March 1944, for continued training.\n\nThe division landed in the [[San Fabian]] area of [[Luzon]] on 11 January 1945 to enter the struggle for the liberation of the [[Philippines]]. It drove across the [[Luzon Central Plain]], meeting the enemy at [[Binalonan]], 17 January. Moving through the rice paddies, the 25th occupied [[Umingan]], [[Lupao]], and [[San Jose City, Nueva Ecija|San Jose]] and destroyed a great part of the Japanese armor on Luzon. On 21 February, the division began operations in the [[Caraballo Mountains]]. It fought its way along Highway No. 5, taking [[Digdig]], [[Putlan]], and [[Kapintalan]] against fierce Japanese counterattacks and took [[Balete Pass]], 13 May, and opened the gateway to the [[Cagayan Valley]], 27 May, with the capture of Santa Fe. Until 30 June, when the division was relieved, it carried out mopping-up activities. On 1 July, the division moved to [[Tarlac]] for training, leaving for Japan, 20 September.\n\n{{Infobox command structure\n|name=25th Infantry Division\n|date=1942-1945\n|parent=[[United States Army Pacific]] \n|subordinate=\n* Headquarters, 25th Infantry Division\n* [[27th Infantry Regiment (United States)|27th Infantry Regiment]]\n* [[35th Infantry Regiment (United States)|35th Infantry Regiment]]\n* [[161st Infantry Regiment (United States)|161st Infantry Regiment]]\n* 65th Engineer Combat Battalion\n* 25th Medical Battalion\n* 25th Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop (Mechanized)\n* Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 25th Infantry Division Artillery\n** [[8th Field Artillery Regiment|8th Field Artillery Battalion]] ([[M101 howitzer|105 mm]])\n** 64th Field Artillery Battalion (105 mm)\n** 89th Field Artillery Battalion (105 mm)\n** 90th Field Artillery Battalion ([[M114 155 mm howitzer|155 mm]])\n* Headquarters, Special Troops, 25th Infantry Division\n** 25th Signal Company\n** 725th Ordnance Light Maintenance Company\n** 25th Quartermaster Company\n** Military Police Platoon\n** Band\n* 25th Counterintelligence Corps Detachment\n}}\n\n====Casualties====\n\n*'''Total battle casualties:''' 5,432<ref name=\"Adjutant General 1953\">Army Battle Casualties and Nonbattle Deaths, Final Report (Statistical and Accounting Branch\nOffice of the Adjutant General, 1 June 1953)</ref>\n\n*'''Killed in action:''' 1,236<ref name=\"Adjutant General 1953\"/>\n*'''Wounded in action:''' 4,190<ref name=\"Adjutant General 1953\"/>\n*'''Missing in action:''' 4<ref name=\"Adjutant General 1953\"/>\n*'''Prisoner of war:''' 2<ref name=\"Adjutant General 1953\"/>\nThe division's rapid movements during its campaigns led to the adoption of the nickname \"Tropic Lightning\".

Acting under [[United Nations Command (Korea)|United Nations]] (UN) orders, the Division moved from its base in Japan to Korea between 5\u201318 July 1950 to join the [[Eighth United States Army]]. The division, then under the command of Major General [[William B. Kean]], successfully completed its first mission by blocking the approaches to the port city [[Pusan]]. For this action, the Division received its first [[Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation]]. The division participated in the [[Pusan Perimeter Offensive|breakout from the Pusan perimeter]] commencing on 16 September and Eighth Army then [[UN September 1950 counteroffensive|began a general offensive northward]] against crumbling KPA opposition to establish contact with forces of the [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th Infantry Division]] driving southward from the [[Battle of Inchon|Inchon beachhead]]. Major elements of the KPA were destroyed and cut off in this aggressive penetration; the link-up was effected south of [[Suwon]] on 26 September. On 23 September the Division was assigned to the newly activated US [[IX Corps (United States)|IX Corps]]. The UN offensive was continued northwards, past [[Seoul]], and across the 38th Parallel [[UN offensive into North Korea|into North Korea]] on 1 October. The momentum of the attack was maintained, and the race to the North Korean capital, [[Pyongyang]], ended on 19 October when elements of the [[Republic of Korea Army]] (ROK) [[1st Infantry Division (South Korea)|1st Infantry Division]] and US [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]] [[Battle of Pyongyang (1950)|captured the city]]. The advance continued, but against unexpectedly stiffening resistance. The Chinese [[People's Volunteer Army]] (PVA) entered the war on the side of North Korea, making their [[UN offensive into North Korea#Chinese First Phase Campaign (25 October-6 November)|first attacks]] in late October. The UN forces renewed their offensive on 24 November before being stopped by the PVA [[Second Phase Offensive]] starting on 25 November. The division was forced to carry out a systematic withdrawal and ordered to take up defensive positions on the south bank of the [[Chongchon River]] on 30 November 1950. Eventually, these lines failed and Eighth Army suffering heavy casualties, ordered a [[UN retreat from North Korea|complete withdrawal]] to the [[Imjin River]], near the 38th Parallel.\n\nAfter a month and a half of planning and reorganization, a [[Operation Thunderbolt (1951)|new offensive]] was launched on 25 January 1951, and succeeded in recapturing [[Inchon]] and [[Gimpo International Airport|Kimpo Air Base]]. This was the first of several successful assaults on the PVA/KPA. The division next participated in [[Operation Ripper]], during which it drove the PVA across the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]]. Success continued with Operations [[Operation Dauntless|Dauntless]] and [[UN May\u2013June 1951 counteroffensive#Operation Piledriver|Piledriver]] in early 1951. These offensives secured part of the [[Iron Triangle (Korea)|Iron Triangle]] which enhanced the UN's bargaining position. With leaders of four nations now at the negotiating tables in the summer of 1951, Division activity slowed to patrol and defensive actions to maintain the line of resistance. This type of action continued into the winter of 1952. In January 1953 the Division was transferred from IX Corps to [[I Corps (United States)|I Corps]] and assumed the responsibility of guarding the approaches of Seoul on 5 May 1953. 23 days later, when ceasefire negotiations at Panmunjom stalled, a heavy PVA assault hit the [[Battle of the Nevada Complex|Nevada Complex]], the Division held its ground; the brunt of the attack was absorbed by the attached [[Turkish Brigade]] and the [[14th Infantry Regiment (United States)|14th Infantry Regiment]]. By successfully defending Seoul from continued attack from May to July 1953, the division earned its second Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation. Again negotiators moved toward peace. In July, the division again moved to reserve status at [[Camp Casey, South Korea|Camp Casey]] where it remained through the signing of the armistice 27 July 1953. Fourteen division soldiers were awarded Medals of Honor during the Korean War, making the division one of the most decorated US Army divisions of that war.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nThe division's 14th Infantry Regiment had three recipients of the [[Medal of Honor]], [[Donn F. Porter]], [[Ernest E. West]] and [[Bryant E. Womack]]. The [[24th Infantry Regiment (United States)|24th Infantry Regiment]] had two recipients, [[Cornelius H. Charlton]] and [[William Thompson (Medal of Honor, 1950)|William Thompson]]. The [[35th Infantry Regiment (United States)|35th Infantry Regiment]] had three recipients, [[William R.

Desiderio]], [[Benito Martinez (Medal of Honor)|Benito Martinez]], [[Lewis L. Millett]] and [[Jerome A. Sudut]]. The divisions patch is sometimes referred to as the \"Electric Strawberry\".\n\nThe division remained in Korea until 1954 and returned to Hawaii from September through October of that year. After a 12-year absence, the 25th Infantry Division had finally returned home.\n\n{{Infobox command structure\n|name=25th Infantry Division\n|date=1955\n|parent=[[United States Army Pacific]] \n|subordinate=\n* 14th Infantry Regiment\n*27th Infantry Regiment\n*35th Infantry Regiment\n**(each regiment had:\n**three Infantry Battalions, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd\n**Service Company\n**Medical Company\n**Heavy Mortar Company\n**Tank Company)\n* Division Artillery\n**8th Artillery Battalion (105T)\n**64th Artillery Battalion (105T)\n**69th Artillery Battalion (105T)\n**90th Artillery Battalion (155T)\n* Division Trains\n**25th Quartermaster Company\n**25th Medical Battalion\n**725th Ordnance Battalion\n* Division Troops\n**25th Aviation Company\n**25th Reconnaissance Company\n**89th Tank Battalion\n** 65th Engineer Battalion\n** 125th Signal Company\n** 25th Military Intelligence Company\n** 25th Replacement Company\n** 25th Finance Company\n** 25th Military Police Company\n**25th Inf Div Band\n}}\nOn 1 February 1957, the division was reorganized as a [[Pentomic]] Division.  The division's three infantry regiments (the [[14th Infantry Regiment (United States)|14th]], [[27th Infantry Regiment (United States)|27th]] and [[35th Infantry Regiment (United States)|35th]]) were inactivated, with their elements reorganized into five infantry battle groups (the [[14th Infantry Regiment (United States)|1-14 IN]], [[27th Infantry Regiment (United States)|1-27 IN]], [[35th Infantry Regiment (United States)|1-35 IN]], [[19th Infantry Regiment (United States)|2-19 IN]] and the [[21st Infantry Regiment (United States)|2-21 IN]]).\n\nIn August 1963, the division was reorganized as a [[Reorganization Objective Army Division]] (ROAD).  Three Brigade Headquarters were activated and Infantry units were reorganized into battalions.\n\n===Vietnam War===\n[[File:Tank-saigon.gif|thumb|225px|Tank from 1st Battalion, 69th Armor, 25th Infantry Division, moves through Saigon shortly after disembarking from LST at Saigon Harbor, 12 March 1966]]\nIn response to a request from the U.S. Military Assistance Command in [[Vietnam]], the division sent 100 helicopter [[door-gunner]]s to [[South Vietnam]] in early 1963. By August 1965, further division involvement in the coming Vietnam War included the deployment of Company C, [[65th Engineer Battalion]], to South Vietnam to assist in the construction of port facilities at [[Cam Ranh Bay]]. By mid-1965, 2,200 men of the Tropic Lightning Division were involved in Vietnam. The division was again ordered to contribute combat forces in December of that year. Its resupply regiment, the 467th, was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel George S Dotson through the end of the war.\n\nIn response to a [[MACV]] request, the division deployed the 3rd Brigade, a Reinforced Task Force, with 5,150 infantrymen and 9,000 tons of equipment from Hawaii in 25 days to the Northwest sector of South Vietnam to firmly establish a fortified enclave from which the division could operate. [[Operation Blue Light]] was the largest and longest airlift of personnel and cargo into a combat zone in military history before [[Operation Desert Shield]]. The brigade deployed its first soldiers from [[Hickam Air Force Base]], Honolulu, to the central highlands at [[Pleiku]]. These men arrived in Vietnam 24 December 1965. By mid-January, the deployment operation was complete&nbsp;\u2014 giving combat planners in Vietnam a favorable balance of power. The 25th Infantry Division had its headquarters at [[C\u1ee7 Chi Base Camp]], near the [[Iron Triangle (Vietnam)|Iron Triangle]] from January 1966 until February 1970. The division was heavily engaged from April 1966 until 1972 throughout the area of operations in Southeast Asia. During this period, Tropic Lightning soldiers fought in some of the toughest battles of the war including [[Operation Junction City]].\n\nDuring the [[Tet offensive]]s of 1968 and [[Tet 1969|1969]], Tropic Lightning soldiers were instrumental in defending the besieged city of [[Saigon]].  From May through June 1970, division soldiers participated in Allied thrusts deep into enemy sanctuaries located in [[Cambodia]]. In these [[Cambodian Incursion|Incursion]] operations, the division units confiscated thousands of tons of supplies and hundreds of weapons. This operation crippled the Cambodian-based efforts against American units. Following its return from Cambodia to South Vietnam, the division resumed its place in the [[Vietnamization]] Program. The war was winding down. By late December 1970, elements of the 25th Infantry Division were able to begin redeployment to [[Schofield Barracks]]. Second Brigade was the last element of the division to depart Vietnam. It arrived at Ft Lewis, Washington in the early days of May 1971. Some elements in the 2nd Brigade were originally assigned to the 4th Infantry Division when they arrived in Vietnam. During the war in Vietnam, 22 [[Medal of Honor|Medals of Honor]] were awarded to Tropic Lightning soldiers.\n\n===Reorganization and light infantry status===\nAfter its return to Schofield Barracks, the 25th Infantry Division remained the only Army division to have never been stationed in the continental United States. In a time of overall military downsizing, it was reduced to a single brigade numbering 4,000 men. The division was reactivated in March 1972. It was reorganized to include as a \"roundout\" brigade the [[29th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (United States)|29th Infantry Brigade]] of the [[Hawaii Army National Guard]] which included: the [[299th Infantry Regiment (United States)|2nd Battalion, 299th Infantry]], Hawaii Army National Guard; [[100th Infantry Battalion (United States)|100th Battalion]], [[442nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|442d Infantry]], US Army Reserve; and the 1st Battalion, [[184th Infantry Regiment (United States)|184th Infantry]] [[California Army National Guard]]. Now reorganized, the 25th Infantry Division trained for the next eight years throughout the Pacific Theater and continued to improve its combat capabilities with troop deployment varying in size from squads, who participated in training missions with Fijian forces, to exercises as large as [[Team Spirit]], where more than 5,000 divisional troops and 1,700 pieces of equipment were airlifted to South Korea for this annual exercise.\n\n[[File:25th US Infantry Division 1989.png|thumb|480px|25th US Infantry Division 1989]]\nIn 1985, the division began its reorganization from a conventional infantry division to a [[light infantry]] division. The four primary characteristics of this new light infantry division were to be: mission flexibility, rapid deployment and combat readiness at 100 percent strength with a Pacific Basin orientation. Major configuration changes included the addition of a third infantry brigade, an additional direct-support artillery battalion and the expansion of the combat aviation battalion to a brigade-sized unit. With the transfer of large quantities of heavy equipment, the 25th Infantry Division earned the designation \"light\"&nbsp;\u2014 the reorganization was completed by 1 October 1986. Training became more sophisticated and more intense. In 1988, the division's first battalions participated in rotations at the [[Fort Chaffee|Joint Readiness Training Center]], [[Fort Chaffee]], Arkansas. This training center provides the most realistic training available to light forces in the Army. Coupled with joint/combined training exercises [[Cobra Gold]] in Thailand, [[Exercise Kangaroo|Kangaroo]] in Australia and [[Orient Shield]] in Japan, the division's demanding exercise schedule significantly increased the division's fighting capabilities. Until 1993 Operation Team Spirit in Korea remained the division's largest annual maneuver exercise, involving more than half of the division's strength.\n\n===Desert Storm and the Post-Cold War era===\nNot many of the division's units participated in [[Operation Desert Storm]], due to the division being earmarked for Pacific contingencies, such as a renewal of hostilities in Korea. However, during the [[Gulf War]], one platoon each from Companies A, B and C, 4th Battalion, 27th Infantry, deployed to [[Saudi Arabia]] in January 1991. These Tropic Lightning soldiers were scheduled to be replacement squads in the ground campaign; however, after observing their performance in desert warfare training, the Assistant Commander of Third U.S. Army asked for them to become the security force for the Army's forward headquarters. In that role, the Wolfhound platoons were alerted and attached to Third Army (Forward) into [[Kuwait City]] 26 February, where they secured the headquarters area and conducted mop-up operations in the city and its adjacent mine fields. Company A's platoon was separated from the other Wolfhounds following that battle to accompany General [[Norman Schwarzkopf, Jr.|H. Norman Schwarzkopf]] into Iraq 1 March 1991 to provide security at the truce signing. The three platoons returned to Schofield Barracks without casualties on 20 March 1991.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\nIn 1995, the division underwent another reorganization and reduction as a part of the Army's downsizing. First Brigade and its direct support units were inactivated and moved to [[Fort Lewis]], Washington, where they were again reactivated as a detached brigade of the 25th Infantry Division (Light). In early 2005, an airborne brigade was created at [[Fort Richardson (Alaska)|Fort Richardson]], Alaska and added to the 25th. Today the division is composed of the 1st and 2nd Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (based in [[Fort Wainwright]], Alaska and [[Schofield Barracks]], Hawaii, respectively), the 3rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team (Schofield Barracks) and The 4th Airborne Brigade Combat Team (based at Fort Richardson, Alaska), in addition to the [[Combat Aviation Brigade]], a division support command and a complement of separate battalions. As a major ground reserve force for the U.S. Pacific Command, the \"Tropic Lightning\" Division routinely deploys from Schofield Barracks to participate in exercises in Japan, [[Korea]], Thailand, the [[Philippines]], Australia and the Big Island of Hawaii.\n\n===Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan===\n[[File:DA-SD-06-03422.JPG|thumb|left|220px|A sniper from the 25th Infantry Division on patrol in Mosul, Iraq.]]\n\nThe division did not take part in the fighting in [[Afghanistan]] and Iraq from 2001\u20132003. However, in early 2004, units from the division deployed to Iraq to take part in the combat operations of that country. The 2d Brigade deployed in January 2004 to Iraq and returned to Schofield Barracks in February of the following year. The 3d Brigade, 25th Infantry Division began deploying to Afghanistan in March 2004. The first element to deploy was 2d Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment (\"Wolfhounds\"). They were accompanied by Battery B, 3d Battalion, [[7th Field Artillery Regiment (United States)|7th Field Artillery Regiment]]. The Wolfhounds operated in the volatile Paktika Province on the border with Pakistan in the Waziristan region. The 25th Infantry Division redeployed to Schofield Barracks Hawaii in April 2005.\n[[File:Army Spc Richard Burton 25th CAB.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Army Spc. Richard Burton, crew chief with the 25th Infantry Division, provides security in a Black Hawk helicopter during a flight mission over Afghanistan's Kandahar province, 26 Nov. 2012.]]\nThe 25th Infantry Division is recognized for the first successful free democratic elections in Afghanistan on 9 October 2004. One of the missions of the 25th Infantry Division was to track down insurgent Taliban and Al-Qaeda members in the mountainous terrain of Afghanistan. In July 2005, a 4th Brigade was added to the 25th Infantry Division as an airborne brigade stationed in Fort Richardson, Alaska. It deployed in October 2006 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The 2d Brigade began its transformation as a [[Stryker]] [[Brigade combat team|Brigade Combat Team]] while the 3d Brigade began its transformation as a unit of action (UA) in the same year. The (Light) status was dropped from the division name in January 2006. On 15 December 2006 the [[172nd Infantry Brigade (United States)|172d Infantry Brigade]] was reflagged as the 1st BCT, 25th Infantry Division; concurrently, the former 1st BCT (Stryker) at Fort Lewis, Washington was reflagged as the 2d Cavalry Regiment (Stryker) and moved to Vilseck, Germany.\n\nFrom 2007 through 2009 elements of the 25th, including the 1/21 \"Gimlets\" from Schofield served in Iraq in the vicinity of Baghdad, serving proudly and at great cost. Beginning in 2005 the 2nd Brigade including the 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry underwent reorganization from light to a Stryker brigade combat team. The brigade arrived in Iraq for a fifteen-month tour of duty in November 2007 and was based at Camp Taji northwest of Baghdad. Serving with the Multi-National Division-Baghdad, the brigade was responsible for the rural areas northwest and west of Baghdad with the 1st Battalion operating near Abu Ghuraib. The 1st Battalion, working closely with their Iraqi counterparts, was especially successful in eliminating terrorist cells and uncovering and destroying multiple weapons caches. Select elements of 1st Battalion 21st Infantry, including Alpha Company, participated in the Battle of Sadr City in March 2008. The 1st Battalion returned to Schofield Barracks in February 2009.\n\nAs of March 2009, the 1st BCT, 2d BCT, and 3d BCT were deployed to [[Iraq]] in support of [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] while the 4th BCT deployed to [[Afghanistan]] in support of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]].\n\nIn June\u2013August 2009, elements of the 25th Division participated in [[Operation Champion Sword]].<ref>\n[http://www.usarak.army.mil/alaskapost/Archives2009/090807/Aug07Story17.asp Operation Champion Sword] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922021449/http://www.usarak.army.mil/alaskapost/Archives2009/090807/Aug07Story17.asp |date=22 September 2015 }} {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922021449/http://www.usarak.army.mil/alaskapost/Archives2009/090807/Aug07Story17.asp |date=22 September 2015 }}, ''Alaska Post'', Volume 16, Number 31, 7 August 2009.

On 18 December 2011 the Division Headquarters completed its retrograde, training and security mission and redeployed back to Schofield Barracks Hawaii.\n\nIn April 2011, the 25th's 3d Brigade Combat Team assumed control of the most hostile area of Afghanistan, Regional Command East. A few months later the 1st Brigade deployed to RC-South. 4ABCT followed, deploying in late 2011 for a 12-month deployment. This is 4th Brigade's second deployment to Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.jber.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123281931 |title=3,500 Soldiers of 4th Brigade Combat Team (Airborne), 25th Infantry Division, deploy for year in Afghanistan |first=Matthew |last=Winstead  |work=Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson |date=1 December 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Combat Aviation Brigade, 25th Infantry Division was also in Afghanistan, from 1 January 2012 to 1 January 2013.

Formed in 2014, the group features lead vocalist Will Gould, guitarists Ian Miles and Oliver Burdett (who replaced Sina Nemati in 2015), keyboardist and second vocalist Hannah Greenwood, bassist Sean Scott and drummer Dan Bratton. Creeper released their self-titled debut [[extended play]] (EP) ''[[Creeper (EP)|Creeper]]'' in 2014, which was followed by ''[[The Callous Heart]]'' and ''[[The Stranger (EP)|The Stranger]]'' on [[Roadrunner Records]] in 2015 and 2016, respectively. They released their debut full-length album ''[[Eternity, in Your Arms]]'' in 2017, which debuted at number 18 on the [[UK Albums Chart]].\n\nFormed through their mutual involvement in [[hardcore punk]] and [[post-hardcore]] groups in the Southampton area, Creeper are musically and stylistically influenced by fellow \"goth punk\" groups including [[AFI (band)|AFI]] and [[Alkaline Trio]], as well as more traditional [[punk rock]] acts like [[The Bouncing Souls]] and [[glam rock]] artists such as [[David Bowie]]. The band's songwriting is typically led by Gould and Miles, although Nemati also co-wrote many of their early songs. Creeper were hailed by critics as one of the best new rock bands shortly after their formation, winning a [[Kerrang! Awards|Kerrang! Award]] and a [[Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards|''Metal Hammer'' Golden Gods Award]] in 2016.\n\nAfter releasing and touring in promotion of ''Eternity, in Your Arms'' throughout the year, Creeper announced their disbandment after a show on 1 November 2018. The event was reminiscent of the end of Bowie's [[David Bowie#1972\u20131974: Ziggy Stardust|Ziggy Stardust]] character in 1973, which led many commentators to believe that the band had not in fact broken up, although no official news statement was released to either effect. Exactly one year later, the group returned under with a show in London, and subsequently are set to release their second album ''Sex, Death & the Infinite Void'' in May 2020.\n\n==History==\n===2014\u20132016: Formation and early years===\nCreeper were formed in [[Southampton]] in 2014 by lead vocalist Will Gould and guitarist and backing vocalist Ian Miles, who had

Formed in 2014, the group features lead vocalist Will Gould, guitarists Ian Miles and Oliver Burdett (who replaced Sina Nemati in 2015), keyboardist and second vocalist Hannah Greenwood, bassist Sean Scott and drummer Dan Bratton. Creeper released their self-titled debut [[extended play]] (EP) ''[[Creeper (EP)|Creeper]]'' in 2014, which was followed by ''[[The Callous Heart]]'' and ''[[The Stranger (EP)|The Stranger]]'' on [[Roadrunner Records]] in 2015 and 2016, respectively. They released their debut full-length album ''[[Eternity, in Your Arms]]'' in 2017, which debuted at number 18 on the [[UK Albums Chart]].\n\nFormed through their mutual involvement in [[hardcore punk]] and [[post-hardcore]] groups in the Southampton area, Creeper are musically and stylistically influenced by fellow \"goth punk\" groups including [[AFI (band)|AFI]] and [[Alkaline Trio]], as well as more traditional [[punk rock]] acts like [[The Bouncing Souls]] and [[glam rock]] artists such as [[David Bowie]]. The band's songwriting is typically led by Gould and Miles, although Nemati also co-wrote many of their early songs. Creeper were hailed by critics as one of the best new rock bands shortly after their formation, winning a [[Kerrang! Awards|Kerrang! Award]] and a [[Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards|''Metal Hammer'' Golden Gods Award]] in 2016.\n\nAfter releasing and touring in promotion of ''Eternity, in Your Arms'' throughout the year, Creeper announced their disbandment after a show on 1 November 2018. The event was reminiscent of the end of Bowie's [[David Bowie#1972\u20131974: Ziggy Stardust|Ziggy Stardust]] character in 1973, which led many commentators to believe that the band had not in fact broken up, although no official news statement was released to either effect. Exactly one year later, the group returned under with a show in London, and subsequently are set to release their second album ''Sex, Death & the Infinite Void'' in May 2020.\n\n==History==\n===2014\u20132016: Formation and early years===\nCreeper were formed in [[Southampton]] in 2014 by lead vocalist Will Gould and guitarist and backing vocalist Ian Miles, who had previously worked together as members of [[punk rock]] band [[Our Time Down Here]], along with second guitarist Sina Nemati, bassist and backing vocalist Sean Scott, and drummer Dan Bratton.<ref

Beginning in 1890, the university's first Bucky Badger was a live, temperamental and unruly [[badger]] who was quickly retired. Although the nickname of the Wisconsin teams remained the \"Badgers\", it was not until Art Evans drew the early caricature version of Bucky in 1940 that today's recognizable image of Bucky was adopted. In 1949, a contest was held to name the mascot, but no consensus was reached after only a few entries were received. In reaction, the contest committee chose the name Buckingham U. Badger, or \"Bucky\", for short.\n\nAt Wisconsin football games in the 1920s live mascots were used to inspire fans. The animals used included a black bear, a bonnet monkey, and live badgers. 1949 was the first year a student sporting a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 badger head appeared; this subsequently replaced the use of live badgers.<ref>Arthur Hove.

Beginning in 1890, the university's first Bucky Badger was a live, temperamental and unruly [[badger]] who was quickly retired. Although the nickname of the Wisconsin teams remained the \"Badgers\", it was not until Art Evans drew the early caricature version of Bucky in 1940 that today's recognizable image of Bucky was adopted. In 1949, a contest was held to name the mascot, but no consensus was reached after only a few entries were received. In reaction, the contest committee chose the name Buckingham U. Badger, or \"Bucky\", for short.\n\nAt Wisconsin football games in the 1920s live mascots were used to inspire fans. The animals used included a black bear, a bonnet monkey, and live badgers. 1949 was the first year a student sporting a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 badger head appeared; this subsequently replaced the use of live badgers.<ref>Arthur Hove.

The current radio station, WSUM, began in 1997 in a [[webcast]] only format because of the prolonged battle to get an FCC license and construct a tower. This lasted five years until February 22, 2002, when the station started broadcasting over [[frequency modulation|FM]] airwaves at 91.7 from its tower in [[Montrose, Wisconsin]]. The radio station currently has around 200 volunteer DJs and eight paid managers. All UW\u2013Madison students, as well as a limited number of community members, are eligible to participate in running the station. WSUM remains entirely free format, which means that the on-air personnel can showcase a large variety of music and talk programming at their discretion with few limitations.
