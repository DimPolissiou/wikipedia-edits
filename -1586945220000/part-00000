Contrasting fabrics, slashes, [[embroidery]], applied trims, and other forms of surface ornamentation became prominent. The tall, narrow lines of the late [[Medieval]] period were replaced with a wide silhouette, conical for women with breadth at the hips and broadly square for men with width at the shoulders. Sleeves were a center of attention, and were puffed, slashed, cuffed, and turned back to reveal contrasting [[lining (sewing)|linings]].\n\n[[Henry VIII of England]] (ruled 1509\u20131547) and [[Francis I of France]] (ruled 1515\u20131547) strove to host the most glittering [[renaissance]] court, culminating in the festivities around the [[Field of Cloth of Gold]] (1520).<ref>Ashelford, Jane: ''Visual History of Dress in the Sixteenth Century'', introduction</ref> But the rising power was [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], king of [[Spain]], [[Naples]], and [[Sicily]] from 1516, heir to the style as well as the riches of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]], and [[Holy Roman Emperor]] from 1520.  The inflow of gold and silver from the [[New World]] into recently united Spain changed the dynamics of trade throughout Western Europe, ushering in a period of increased opulence in clothing that was tempered by the Spanish taste for sombre richness of dress that would dominate the second half of the century.<ref>Boucher, Fran\u00e7ois: ''20,000 Years of Fashion''</ref><ref>Ashelford, Jane: ''The Art of Dress: Clothing and Society 1500\u20131914'', Abrams, 1996.</ref> This widespread adaptation of Hispanic court attire in Europe was seen as a sign of allegiance to the empire of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cox- Rearick|first=Janet|title=Power-Dressing at the Courts of Cosimo de' Medici and Fran\u00e7ois I: The \"moda alla spagnola\" of Spanish Consorts El\u00e9onore d'Autriche and Eleonora di Toledo|journal=Artibus et Historiae|year=2009|volume=30|issue=60|pages=39\u201369|series=60|jstor=25702881}}</ref>\n\nRegional variations in fashionable clothing that arose in the 15th century became more pronounced in the sixteenth. In particular, the clothing of the Low Countries, German states, and [[Scandinavia]] developed in a different direction than that of [[England]], [[France]], and [[Italy]], although all acknowledged the sobering and formal influence of Spanish dress after the mid-1520s.<ref>Boucher, Fran\u00e7ois: ''20,000 Years of Fashion'', pp. 219 and 244</ref>\n\n[[Linen]] [[shirt]]s and [[chemise]]s or smocks had full sleeves and often full bodies, pleated or gathered closely at neck and wrist.  The resulting small frill gradually became a wide ruffle, presaging the [[ruff (clothing)|ruff]] of the latter half of the century.  These garments were often decorated with [[embroidery]] in black or red silk, and occasionally with gold metal threads if the garment was meant to be flashier of ones wealth.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rublack|first=Ulinka|title=Dressing Up: Cultural Identity in Renaissance Europe|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-964518-3|page=11}}</ref>  The bodice was boned and stiffened to create a more structured form, and often a busk was inserted to emphasize the flattening and elongation of the torso.<ref>Lester, Katherine and Rose Kerr, \"Historic Costume\" Chas. A. Bennett Co., Inc.

The turned-back cuffs are lined with fur.<ref>The fur is probably [[lynx]], and the skirt of the dress also appears to be fur-lined; see Janet Arnold, ''Queen Elizabeth's Wardrobe Unlock'd'', p. 125</ref>]]\n\nWomen's fashions of the early 16th century consisted of a long gown, usually with sleeves, worn over a ''kirtle'' or undergown, with a linen [[chemise|chemise or smock]] worn next to the skin.\n\nThe high-waisted gown of the late [[medieval]] period evolved in several directions in different parts of Europe.  In the German states and [[Bohemia]], gowns remained short-waisted, tight-laced but without [[corset]]s. The open-fronted gown laced over the kirtle or a [[stomacher|stomacher or plackard]].  Sleeves were puffed and slashed, or elaborately cuffed.\n\nIn France, England, and Flanders, the high waistline gradually descended to the natural waist in front (following Spanish fashion) and then to a V-shaped point.   Cuffs grew larger and were elaborately trimmed.\n\nHoop skirts or [[farthingale]]s had appeared in Spain at the very end of the 15th century, and spread to England and France over the next few decades.   [[Corset]]s also appeared during this period.\n\nA variety of [[hat]]s, [[cap]]s, hoods, hair nets, and other headresses were worn, with strong regional variations.\n\nShoes were flat, with broad square toes.\n\n=== German fashion ===\n\nIn the first half of the 16th century, German dress varied widely from the costume worn in other parts of Europe.  Skirts were cut separately from bodices, though often sewn together, and the open-fronted gown laced over a kirtle with a wide band of rich fabric, often jeweled and embroidered, across the bust.  [[Partlet]]s (called in German ''gollers'' or collars) were worn with the low-cut bodice to cover the neck and shoulders, and were made in a variety of styles.  The most popular goller was a round shoulder-capelet, frequently of black velvet lined in silk or fur, with a standing neckband; this goller would remain in use in some parts of Germany into the 17th century and became part of [[national dress]] in some areas.<ref>K\u00f5hler,''History of Costume'', \"Sixteenth Century\"</ref>\n\nNarrow sleeves were worn in the earliest years of the century, and were later decorated with bands of contrasting fabric and rows of small panes or strips over puffed linings.  Skirts were trimmed with bands of contrasting fabric, but were closed all around.  They would be worn draped up to display an underskirt.\n\nFrom 1530, elements of Spanish dress were rapidly adopted in fashionable Germany under the influence of the imperial court of Charles V.<ref>K\u00f5hler, ''History of Costume'', \"Sixteenth Century\"</ref>\n\n=== Gowns ===\n\n[[Image:Anne boleyn.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Portrait of [[Anne Boleyn]], wife of Henry VIII of England, depicting Anne in c.1533, wearing a French hood trimmed with pearls, and a square-necked black velvet gown decorated with the same pearls and embroidery, and furred sleeves.]]\n\nDress in Holland, Belgium, and Flanders, now part of the Empire, retained a high, belted waistline longest.  Italian gowns were fitted to the waist, with full skirts below.\n\nThe French gown of the first part of the century was loosely fitted to the body and flared from the hips, with a [[train (clothing)|train]].  The neckline was square and might reveal the kirtle and chemise beneath.  Cuffed sleeves were wide at the wrist and grew wider, displaying a decorated undersleeve attached to the kirtle.  The gown fastened in front early, sometimes lacing over the kirtle or a stomacher, and the skirt might be slit in front or the train tucked up in back to display the skirt of the kirtle.\n\nAs a fitted style emerged under Spanish influence, the gown was made as a separate [[bodice]] and skirt; this bodice usually fastened at the side or the side-back with hooks and eyes or lacing.\n\nFrom the 1530s, French and English fashions featured an open, square-necked gown with long sleeves fitted smoothly over a tight [[corset]] or ''[[bodice|pair of bodies]]'' and a farthingale.  With the smooth, conical line of the skirt, the front of the kirtle or petticoat was displayed, and a decorated panel called a ''forepart'', heavily embroidered and sometimes jeweled, was pinned to the petticoat or directly to the farthingale.\n\nThe earlier cuffed sleeves evolved into ''trumpet sleeves'', tight on the upper arm and flared below, with wide, turned back cuffs (often lined with fur) worn over full undersleeves that might match the decorated forepart.  At the very end of the period, full ''round sleeves'' (perhaps derived from Italian fashions) began to replace the flaring trumpet sleeves, which disappeared by the later 1550s.\n\nFabric or chain ''girdles'' were worn at the waist and hung down to roughly knee length; a tassel or small prayer book or purse might be suspended from the girdle.\n\nThe low neckline of the dress could be filled with a [[partlet]].  Black velvet partlets lined in white with a high, flared neckline were worn pinned over the gown.  Partlets of the same rich fabric as the bodice of the gown give the appearance of a high-necked gown.  Sheer or opaque linen partlets were worn over the chemise or smock, and high-necked smocks began to appear; toward 1550 these might have a small standing collar with a ruffle, which would become the pleated [[ruff (clothing)|ruff]] of the next [[1550\u20131600 in fashion|period]].\n\n=== Hats and headgear ===\n\nIn France, England, and the Low Countries, black hoods with veils at the back were worn over linen undercaps that allowed the front hair (parted in the middle) to show.  These hoods became more complex and structured over time.\n\nUnique to England was the [[gable hood]], a wired headdress shaped like the gable of a house.  In the 16th century gable headdress had long embroidered lappets framing the face and a loose veil behind; later the gable hood would be worn over several layers that completely concealed the hair, and the lappets and veil would be pinned up in a variety of ways.\n\n<!-- [[Image:Gerard David 006 detail1.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Flemish hood c. 1500 is worn over an undercap with a fluted (finely [[pleat]]ed) frill -->\n\n[[Image:Albrecht D\u00fcrer 092.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]'s ''Young Woman'' of 1507 wears hat called a ''barett'', popular in the German states.]]\n\nA simple rounded hood of the early years of the century evolved into the [[French hood]], popular in both France and England; its arched shape sat further back on the head and displayed the front hair which was parted in the center and pinned up in braids or twists under the veil.\n\nGerman women adopted hats like fashionable men's ''baretts'' early in the century; these were worn over caps or cauls (''colettes'') made of netted cord over a silk lining.<ref>K\u00f5hler, ''History of Costume''</ref> Hats became fashionable in England as an alternative to the hood toward the 1540s. Close fitting caps of fur were worn in cold climates.\n\nLinen caps called [[coif]]s were worn under the fur cap, hood or hat.\n\nIn warmer climates including Italy and Spain, hair was more often worn uncovered, braided or twisted with ribbons and pinned up, or confined in a net.  A Spanish style of the later 15th century was still worn in this period: the hair was puffed over the ears before being drawn back at chin level into a braid or wrapped twist at the nape.\n\nFirst-time brides wore their hair loose, in token of virginity, and a wreath or chaplet of orange blossoms was traditional. A jeweled wreath with [[Vitreous enamel|enameled]] \"orange blossoms\" was sometimes worn.\n\n=== Jewelry and accessories ===\n\nWomen of wealth wore gold chains and other precious jewelry; collar-like [[necklace]]s called ''carcanets'', [[earring]]s, [[bracelet]]s, [[Ring (finger)|rings]], and jeweled pins.  Bands of jeweler's work were worn as trim by the nobility, and would be moved from dress to dress and reused.  Large brooches were worn to pin overpartlets to the dress beneath.\n\n[[Dress hook]]s, of [[silver gilt]] for the wealthy and of [[base metal]] for the lower classes, were worn to loop up skirts.<ref name=\"AJ\">{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1017/S0003581500073777| issn = 0003-5815| volume = 82| pages = 157\u2013196| last1 = Gaimster| first1 = David| last2 = Hayward| first2 = Maria| last3 = Mitchell| first3 = David| last4 = Parker| first4 = Karen| title = Tudor Silver-Gilt Dress-hooks: A New Class of Treasure Find in England| journal = The Antiquaries Journal| date = 2002| url = https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquaries-journal/article/div-classtitletudor-silver-gilt-dress-hooks-a-new-class-of-treasure-find-in-englanddiv/45C2FC277BA5F34DB28D3E87BF56AE0A}}</ref><ref name=\"Johnson\">{{cite book| publisher = Fat Goose Press Ltd| isbn = 9780956267412| last = Johnson| first = Caroline| others = Jane Malcolm-Davies, Ninya Mikhaila (eds.)| title = The Queen's Servants: Gentlewomen's Dress at the Accession of Henry VIII| location = Lightwater, Surrey England| date = 2011-12-01 |page=32}}</ref>\n\nA fashionable accessory was the ''[[zibellino]]'', the [[Fur|pelt]] of a [[sable]] or [[marten]] worn draped at the neck or hanging at the waist; some costume historians call these \"flea furs\".

The newly wealthy merchant classes who were not aristocrats could not wear jewelry on their clothing or fabrics restricted to nobles.\n\n[[Gloves]] of soft leather had short, sometimes slashed, cuffs and were perfumed.\n\n===Beauty Ideals===\n\n[[File:Venus and Mars National Gallery.jpg|thumb|500px|''Venus and Mars'', c 1483.

However, these products, such as ceruse, a lead derivative severely irritated the skin, leaving women's faces blemished and burned.  Although safer alternatives existed, women preferred the consistency and coverage offered by ceruse.   Not all cosmetics were dangerous, many women relied on lotions and balms containing almonds, olive oil, lemon juice, bread crumbs, eggs, honey, rosewater and snake fat to clarify and cleanse the skin.   Red lips and rosy cheeks were achieved primarily through the application of [[vermilion]]; ceruse mixed with organic dyes such as [[henna]] and [[cochineal]] (a powder made from the ground exoskeleton of insects).   In Italy especially, women sought to achieve the light tresses that were viewed as the ideal.  Women applied mixtures of lemon juice, alum and white wine and sat in the sun to lighten their hair.  In order to produce loose curls, women wrapped hair saturated in [[gum arabic]] or beer around clay curlers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ribeiro|first=Aileen|title=Facing Beauty: Painted Women & Cosmetic Art|date=2011|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven and London|pages=60\u2013124}}</ref>  Finally, the appearance of a high forehead was achieved by plucking hairs along the hairline, and severely arching or removing the eyebrows altogether.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hunt|first=Kenneth|title=Cultural and Social Influences on the Perception of Beauty: A Case Analysis of the Cosmetics Industry|journal=Journal of Business Case Studies|date=2011|volume=7|issue=1|pages=1\u201310}}</ref>  Although at this time, women could not cosmetologically alter the symmetry of their face, or the structure of their nose in order to obtain the ideal, the products available allowed them to come close.\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Style gallery \u2013 German States and the Low Countries 1500s\u20131520s ===\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\" perrow=\"4\">\nImage:Lucas Cranach d. \u00c4. 036.jpg|1 \u2013 1502\u201303\nImage:Lucas Cranach d.

The neckline was gathered into a narrow band or adjusted by means of a [[drawstring]]; the tiny ruffle formed by pulling up the drawstring became wider over time, and then evolved into the [[ruff (clothing)|ruff]] of the next period.\n* A [[doublet (clothing)|doublet]] with matching sleeves, often slashed or cut to allow the fabric of the shirt beneath to show through.\n* A [[jerkin (garment)|jerkin]], usually cut low to the waist in front to reveal the doublet beneath, with full skirts to the knee.\n* [[Hose (clothing)|Hose]], now usually ending above the knee, with a prominent [[codpiece]] (both sometimes hidden under the skirts of the jerkin).\n* Separate ''nether-hose'' or stockings held up with garters.\n* A front-opening overgown, often fur-lined for warmth and slashed, with sleeves.  The overgown was ankle length early in the period, but knee-length overgowns were fashionable in the 1530s and 1540s.  Scholars, judges, doctors, and other professionals retained the ankle length gown throughout the period.\n\nFrom the 1530s, a narrower silhouette became popular under Spanish influence. Collars were higher and tighter.  Shoulders lost their padding and developed a slight slope. Doublet sleeves became fuller rather than tight. Jerkins closed to the neck; their skirts were shorter and slightly flared rather than full, and they displayed more of the hose.  Overall the fashion was more rigid and restrained.<ref>Kybalov\u00e1, et al.: ''Pictorial Encyclopedia of Fashion''</ref>\n\nLower-class men wore a one-piece garment called a [[cotte]] in English, tight to the waist with knee-length skirts and long sleeves over their hose.\n\nBright colors (reds, yellows, purples, pinks, and greens) were popular.\n\n[[Matth\u00e4us Schwarz]] compiled a ''Klaidungsb\u00fcchlein'' or ''Trachtenbuch'' (usually translated as \"Book of Clothes\"), a book cataloguing the clothing that he wore between 1520 and 1560.<ref>{{cite book |last=Fink |first=August |year=1963 |title=Die Schwarz'schen Trachtenb\u00fccher |url= |location=Berlin |publisher= |isbn= |accessdate= }}</ref>  The book contains color illustrations focused on Schwarz's individual clothing history.<ref>{{cite book|last=Burman|first=Barbara|title=Material Strategies: Dress and Gender in Historical Perspective|year=2003|publisher=Blackwell|location=Malden, MA, USA|isbn=1405109068|page=12}}</ref>\n\n=== Hairstyles and headgear ===\n\nA variety of hats were worn in the period.  The German '''barett'', with its turned-up brim, was fashionable throughout the period, and a similar hat with a turned-up round or \"halo\" brim was popular in the court of Henry VIII.  The ''flat hat'' combined a low, gathered crown with a circular brim and was worn in mid-century.\n\n=== Style gallery 1500\u20131510 ===\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\" perrow=\"3\">\nImage:Arthur Prince of Wales c 1500.jpg|1 \u2013 c. 1500\nImage:Henry Seven England.jpg|2 \u2013 c. 1500\nImage:Giorgione 011.jpg|3 \u2013 1500\u20131510\nImage:LucasCranachtheElderCuspinian.jpg|4 \u2013 1502\u201303\nImage:Raffael 037.jpg|5 \u2013 1506\nImage:HenryVIII 1509.jpg|6 \u2013 1509\n</gallery>\n\n# [[:Image:Arthur Prince of Wales c 1500.jpg|Arthur, Prince of Wales]] wears a red hat with two gold buttons and a badge.

Contrasting fabrics, slashes, [[embroidery]], applied trims, and other forms of surface ornamentation became prominent. The tall, narrow lines of the late [[Medieval]] period were replaced with a wide silhouette, conical for women with breadth at the hips and broadly square for men with width at the shoulders. Sleeves were a center of attention, and were puffed, slashed, cuffed, and turned back to reveal contrasting [[lining (sewing)|linings]].\n\n[[Henry VIII of England]] (ruled 1509\u20131547) and [[Francis I of France]] (ruled 1515\u20131547) strove to host the most glittering [[renaissance]] court, culminating in the festivities around the [[Field of Cloth of Gold]] (1520).<ref>Ashelford, Jane: ''Visual History of Dress in the Sixteenth Century'', introduction</ref> But the rising power was [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], king of [[Spain]], [[Naples]], and [[Sicily]] from 1516, heir to the style as well as the riches of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]], and [[Holy Roman Emperor]] from 1520.  The inflow of gold and silver from the [[New World]] into recently united Spain changed the dynamics of trade throughout Western Europe, ushering in a period of increased opulence in clothing that was tempered by the Spanish taste for sombre richness of dress that would dominate the second half of the century.<ref>Boucher, Fran\u00e7ois: ''20,000 Years of Fashion''</ref><ref>Ashelford, Jane: ''The Art of Dress: Clothing and Society 1500\u20131914'', Abrams, 1996.</ref> This widespread adaptation of Hispanic court attire in Europe was seen as a sign of allegiance to the empire of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cox- Rearick|first=Janet|title=Power-Dressing at the Courts of Cosimo de' Medici and Fran\u00e7ois I: The \"moda alla spagnola\" of Spanish Consorts El\u00e9onore d'Autriche and Eleonora di Toledo|journal=Artibus et Historiae|year=2009|volume=30|issue=60|pages=39\u201369|series=60|jstor=25702881}}</ref>\n\nRegional variations in fashionable clothing that arose in the 15th century became more pronounced in the sixteenth. In particular, the clothing of the Low Countries, German states, and [[Scandinavia]] developed in a different direction than that of [[England]], [[France]], and [[Italy]], although all acknowledged the sobering and formal influence of Spanish dress after the mid-1520s.<ref>Boucher, Fran\u00e7ois: ''20,000 Years of Fashion'', pp. 219 and 244</ref>\n\n[[Linen]] [[shirt]]s and [[chemise]]s or smocks had full sleeves and often full bodies, pleated or gathered closely at neck and wrist.  The resulting small frill gradually became a wide ruffle, presaging the [[ruff (clothing)|ruff]] of the latter half of the century.  These garments were often decorated with [[embroidery]] in black or red silk, and occasionally with gold metal threads if the garment was meant to be flashier of ones wealth.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rublack|first=Ulinka|title=Dressing Up: Cultural Identity in Renaissance Europe|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-964518-3|page=11}}</ref>  The bodice was boned and stiffened to create a more structured form, and often a busk was inserted to emphasize the flattening and elongation of the torso.<ref>Lester, Katherine and Rose Kerr, \"Historic Costume\" Chas.

The turned-back cuffs are lined with fur.<ref>The fur is probably [[lynx]], and the skirt of the dress also appears to be fur-lined; see Janet Arnold, ''Queen Elizabeth's Wardrobe Unlock'd'', p. 125</ref>]]\n\nWomen's fashions of the early 16th century consisted of a long gown, usually with sleeves, worn over a ''kirtle'' or undergown, with a linen [[chemise|chemise or smock]] worn next to the skin.\n\nThe high-waisted gown of the late [[medieval]] period evolved in several directions in different parts of Europe.  In the German states and [[Bohemia]], gowns remained short-waisted, tight-laced but without [[corset]]s. The open-fronted gown laced over the kirtle or a [[stomacher|stomacher or plackard]].  Sleeves were puffed and slashed, or elaborately cuffed.\n\nIn France, England, and Flanders, the high waistline gradually descended to the natural waist in front (following Spanish fashion) and then to a V-shaped point.   Cuffs grew larger and were elaborately trimmed.\n\nHoop skirts or [[farthingale]]s had appeared in Spain at the very end of the 15th century, and spread to England and France over the next few decades.   [[Corset]]s also appeared during this period.\n\nA variety of [[hat]]s, [[cap]]s, hoods, hair nets, and other headresses were worn, with strong regional variations.\n\nShoes were flat, with broad square toes.\n\n=== German fashion ===\n\nIn the first half of the 16th century, German dress varied widely from the costume worn in other parts of Europe.  Skirts were cut separately from bodices, though often sewn together, and the open-fronted gown laced over a kirtle with a wide band of rich fabric, often jeweled and embroidered, across the bust.  [[Partlet]]s (called in German ''gollers'' or collars) were worn with the low-cut bodice to cover the neck and shoulders, and were made in a variety of styles.  The most popular goller was a round shoulder-capelet, frequently of black velvet lined in silk or fur, with a standing neckband; this goller would remain in use in some parts of Germany into the 17th century and became part of [[national dress]] in some areas.<ref>K\u00f5hler,''History of Costume'', \"Sixteenth Century\"</ref>\n\nNarrow sleeves were worn in the earliest years of the century, and were later decorated with bands of contrasting fabric and rows of small panes or strips over puffed linings.  Skirts were trimmed with bands of contrasting fabric, but were closed all around.  They would be worn draped up to display an underskirt.\n\nFrom 1530, elements of Spanish dress were rapidly adopted in fashionable Germany under the influence of the imperial court of Charles V.<ref>K\u00f5hler, ''History of Costume'', \"Sixteenth Century\"</ref>\n\n=== Gowns ===\n\n[[Image:Anne boleyn.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Portrait of [[Anne Boleyn]], wife of Henry VIII of England, depicting Anne in c.1533, wearing a French hood trimmed with pearls, and a square-necked black velvet gown decorated with the same pearls and embroidery, and furred sleeves.]]\n\nDress in Holland, Belgium, and Flanders, now part of the Empire, retained a high, belted waistline longest.  Italian gowns were fitted to the waist, with full skirts below.\n\nThe French gown of the first part of the century was loosely fitted to the body and flared from the hips, with a [[train (clothing)|train]].  The neckline was square and might reveal the kirtle and chemise beneath.  Cuffed sleeves were wide at the wrist and grew wider, displaying a decorated undersleeve attached to the kirtle.  The gown fastened in front early, sometimes lacing over the kirtle or a stomacher, and the skirt might be slit in front or the train tucked up in back to display the skirt of the kirtle.\n\nAs a fitted style emerged under Spanish influence, the gown was made as a separate [[bodice]] and skirt; this bodice usually fastened at the side or the side-back with hooks and eyes or lacing.\n\nFrom the 1530s, French and English fashions featured an open, square-necked gown with long sleeves fitted smoothly over a tight [[corset]] or ''[[bodice|pair of bodies]]'' and a farthingale.  With the smooth, conical line of the skirt, the front of the kirtle or petticoat was displayed, and a decorated panel called a ''forepart'', heavily embroidered and sometimes jeweled, was pinned to the petticoat or directly to the farthingale.\n\nThe earlier cuffed sleeves evolved into ''trumpet sleeves'', tight on the upper arm and flared below, with wide, turned back cuffs (often lined with fur) worn over full undersleeves that might match the decorated forepart.  At the very end of the period, full ''round sleeves'' (perhaps derived from Italian fashions) began to replace the flaring trumpet sleeves, which disappeared by the later 1550s.\n\nFabric or chain ''girdles'' were worn at the waist and hung down to roughly knee length; a tassel or small prayer book or purse might be suspended from the girdle.\n\nThe low neckline of the dress could be filled with a [[partlet]].  Black velvet partlets lined in white with a high, flared neckline were worn pinned over the gown.  Partlets of the same rich fabric as the bodice of the gown give the appearance of a high-necked gown.  Sheer or opaque linen partlets were worn over the chemise or smock, and high-necked smocks began to appear; toward 1550 these might have a small standing collar with a ruffle, which would become the pleated [[ruff (clothing)|ruff]] of the next [[1550\u20131600 in fashion|period]].\n\n=== Hats and headgear ===\n\nIn France, England, and the Low Countries, black hoods with veils at the back were worn over linen undercaps that allowed the front hair (parted in the middle) to show.  These hoods became more complex and structured over time.\n\nUnique to England was the [[gable hood]], a wired headdress shaped like the gable of a house.  In the 16th century gable headdress had long embroidered lappets framing the face and a loose veil behind; later the gable hood would be worn over several layers that completely concealed the hair, and the lappets and veil would be pinned up in a variety of ways.\n\n<!-- [[Image:Gerard David 006 detail1.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Flemish hood c. 1500 is worn over an undercap with a fluted (finely [[pleat]]ed) frill -->\n\n[[Image:Albrecht D\u00fcrer 092.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]'s ''Young Woman'' of 1507 wears hat called a ''barett'', popular in the German states.]]\n\nA simple rounded hood of the early years of the century evolved into the [[French hood]], popular in both France and England; its arched shape sat further back on the head and displayed the front hair which was parted in the center and pinned up in braids or twists under the veil.\n\nGerman women adopted hats like fashionable men's ''baretts'' early in the century; these were worn over caps or cauls (''colettes'') made of netted cord over a silk lining.<ref>K\u00f5hler, ''History of Costume''</ref> Hats became fashionable in England as an alternative to the hood toward the 1540s. Close fitting caps of fur were worn in cold climates.\n\nLinen caps called [[coif]]s were worn under the fur cap, hood or hat.\n\nIn warmer climates including Italy and Spain, hair was more often worn uncovered, braided or twisted with ribbons and pinned up, or confined in a net.  A Spanish style of the later 15th century was still worn in this period: the hair was puffed over the ears before being drawn back at chin level into a braid or wrapped twist at the nape.\n\nFirst-time brides wore their hair loose, in token of virginity, and a wreath or chaplet of orange blossoms was traditional. A jeweled wreath with [[Vitreous enamel|enameled]] \"orange blossoms\" was sometimes worn.\n\n=== Jewelry and accessories ===\n\nWomen of wealth wore gold chains and other precious jewelry; collar-like [[necklace]]s called ''carcanets'', [[earring]]s, [[bracelet]]s, [[Ring (finger)|rings]], and jeweled pins.  Bands of jeweler's work were worn as trim by the nobility, and would be moved from dress to dress and reused.  Large brooches were worn to pin overpartlets to the dress beneath.\n\n[[Dress hook]]s, of [[silver gilt]] for the wealthy and of [[base metal]] for the lower classes, were worn to loop up skirts.<ref name=\"AJ\">{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1017/S0003581500073777| issn = 0003-5815| volume = 82| pages = 157\u2013196| last1 = Gaimster| first1 = David| last2 = Hayward| first2 = Maria| last3 = Mitchell| first3 = David| last4 = Parker| first4 = Karen| title = Tudor Silver-Gilt Dress-hooks: A New Class of Treasure Find in England| journal = The Antiquaries Journal| date = 2002| url = https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquaries-journal/article/div-classtitletudor-silver-gilt-dress-hooks-a-new-class-of-treasure-find-in-englanddiv/45C2FC277BA5F34DB28D3E87BF56AE0A}}</ref><ref name=\"Johnson\">{{cite book| publisher = Fat Goose Press Ltd| isbn = 9780956267412| last = Johnson| first = Caroline| others = Jane Malcolm-Davies, Ninya Mikhaila (eds.)| title = The Queen's Servants: Gentlewomen's Dress at the Accession of Henry VIII| location = Lightwater, Surrey England| date = 2011-12-01 |page=32}}</ref>\n\nA fashionable accessory was the ''[[zibellino]]'', the [[Fur|pelt]] of a [[sable]] or [[marten]] worn draped at the neck or hanging at the waist; some costume historians call these \"flea furs\".

The newly wealthy merchant classes who were not aristocrats could not wear jewelry on their clothing or fabrics restricted to nobles.\n\n[[Gloves]] of soft leather had short, sometimes slashed, cuffs and were perfumed.\n\n===Beauty Ideals===\n\n[[File:Venus and Mars National Gallery.jpg|thumb|500px|''Venus and Mars'', c 1483.

However, these products, such as ceruse, a lead derivative severely irritated the skin, leaving women's faces blemished and burned.  Although safer alternatives existed, women preferred the consistency and coverage offered by ceruse.   Not all cosmetics were dangerous, many women relied on lotions and balms containing almonds, olive oil, lemon juice, bread crumbs, eggs, honey, rosewater and snake fat to clarify and cleanse the skin.   Red lips and rosy cheeks were achieved primarily through the application of [[vermilion]]; ceruse mixed with organic dyes such as [[henna]] and [[cochineal]] (a powder made from the ground exoskeleton of insects).   In Italy especially, women sought to achieve the light tresses that were viewed as the ideal.  Women applied mixtures of lemon juice, alum and white wine and sat in the sun to lighten their hair.  In order to produce loose curls, women wrapped hair saturated in [[gum arabic]] or beer around clay curlers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ribeiro|first=Aileen|title=Facing Beauty: Painted Women & Cosmetic Art|date=2011|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven and London|pages=60\u2013124}}</ref>  Finally, the appearance of a high forehead was achieved by plucking hairs along the hairline, and severely arching or removing the eyebrows altogether.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hunt|first=Kenneth|title=Cultural and Social Influences on the Perception of Beauty: A Case Analysis of the Cosmetics Industry|journal=Journal of Business Case Studies|date=2011|volume=7|issue=1|pages=1\u201310}}</ref>  Although at this time, women could not cosmetologically alter the symmetry of their face, or the structure of their nose in order to obtain the ideal, the products available allowed them to come close.\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Style gallery \u2013 German States and the Low Countries 1500s\u20131520s ===\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\" perrow=\"4\">\nImage:Lucas Cranach d. \u00c4. 036.jpg|1 \u2013 1502\u201303\nImage:Lucas Cranach d.

The neckline was gathered into a narrow band or adjusted by means of a [[drawstring]]; the tiny ruffle formed by pulling up the drawstring became wider over time, and then evolved into the [[ruff (clothing)|ruff]] of the next period.\n* A [[doublet (clothing)|doublet]] with matching sleeves, often slashed or cut to allow the fabric of the shirt beneath to show through.\n* A [[jerkin (garment)|jerkin]], usually cut low to the waist in front to reveal the doublet beneath, with full skirts to the knee.\n* [[Hose (clothing)|Hose]], now usually ending above the knee, with a prominent [[codpiece]] (both sometimes hidden under the skirts of the jerkin).\n* Separate ''nether-hose'' or stockings held up with garters.\n* A front-opening overgown, often fur-lined for warmth and slashed, with sleeves.  The overgown was ankle length early in the period, but knee-length overgowns were fashionable in the 1530s and 1540s.  Scholars, judges, doctors, and other professionals retained the ankle length gown throughout the period.\n\nFrom the 1530s, a narrower silhouette became popular under Spanish influence. Collars were higher and tighter.  Shoulders lost their padding and developed a slight slope. Doublet sleeves became fuller rather than tight. Jerkins closed to the neck; their skirts were shorter and slightly flared rather than full, and they displayed more of the hose.  Overall the fashion was more rigid and restrained.<ref>Kybalov\u00e1, et al.: ''Pictorial Encyclopedia of Fashion''</ref>\n\nLower-class men wore a one-piece garment called a [[cotte]] in English, tight to the waist with knee-length skirts and long sleeves over their hose.\n\nBright colors (reds, yellows, purples, pinks, and greens) were popular.\n\n[[Matth\u00e4us Schwarz]] compiled a ''Klaidungsb\u00fcchlein'' or ''Trachtenbuch'' (usually translated as \"Book of Clothes\"), a book cataloguing the clothing that he wore between 1520 and 1560.<ref>{{cite book |last=Fink |first=August |year=1963 |title=Die Schwarz'schen Trachtenb\u00fccher |url= |location=Berlin |publisher= |isbn= |accessdate= }}</ref>  The book contains color illustrations focused on Schwarz's individual clothing history.<ref>{{cite book|last=Burman|first=Barbara|title=Material Strategies: Dress and Gender in Historical Perspective|year=2003|publisher=Blackwell|location=Malden, MA, USA|isbn=1405109068|page=12}}</ref>\n\n=== Hairstyles and headgear ===\n\nA variety of hats were worn in the period.  The German '''barett'', with its turned-up brim, was fashionable throughout the period, and a similar hat with a turned-up round or \"halo\" brim was popular in the court of Henry VIII.  The ''flat hat'' combined a low, gathered crown with a circular brim and was worn in mid-century.\n\n=== Style gallery 1500\u20131510 ===\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\" perrow=\"3\">\nImage:Arthur Prince of Wales c 1500.jpg|1 \u2013 c. 1500\nImage:Henry Seven England.jpg|2 \u2013 c. 1500\nImage:Giorgione 011.jpg|3 \u2013 1500\u20131510\nImage:LucasCranachtheElderCuspinian.jpg|4 \u2013 1502\u201303\nImage:Raffael 037.jpg|5 \u2013 1506\nImage:HenryVIII 1509.jpg|6 \u2013 1509\n</gallery>\n\n# [[:Image:Arthur Prince of Wales c 1500.jpg|Arthur, Prince of Wales]] wears a red hat with two gold buttons and a badge.

Toward the middle of the century, shoes became narrower and were shaped naturally to the foot.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kohler|first=Carl|title=A History of Costume|year=1963|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York, NY|pages=227\u2013274}}</ref>   Soft boots for riding fitted to mid-calf.\n<gallery mode=packed>\nFile:Jan Gossaert 001 detail highres.jpg|German bear-claw shoe, c. 1505\nFile:Jan Gossaert boots (cropped).jpg|Boots from the same painting\nFile:B\u00e4renklauen WK1890.jpg|German bear-claw shoe, 1800s illustration\nFile:Chausse et pied gauche de Sainte Marie-Madeleine, Belles du Nord, restauration PBALille 26 juillet 2016 Lamiot d 03.jpg|French [[duckbill shoe]], circa 1520\nFile:Anonymous Shoes of Sigismund Augustus.jpg|Polish boy's duckbill platform shoes, 1530\nFile:Shoes MET 29.158.889.jpg|English commoner's duckbill shoe, 1500s\nFile:BugenhagenCranach1546 (cropped).JPG|Duck-bill shoes of a [[Wittenberg]] pastor, 1546\n</gallery>\n\n== Children's fashion ==\n\nAs shown in the images below, children's clothing was mostly smaller versions of adult clothing, complete with low necklines and cumbersome underthings.

Contrasting fabrics, slashes, [[embroidery]], applied trims, and other forms of surface ornamentation remained prominent. The wide silhouette, conical for women with breadth at the hips and broadly square for men with width at the shoulders had reached its peak in the 1530s, and by mid-century a tall, narrow line with a V-lined waist was back in fashion.  Sleeves and women's skirts then began to widen again, with emphasis at the shoulder that would continue into the next century.  The characteristic garment of the period was the [[ruff (clothing)|ruff]], which began as a modest ruffle attached to the neckband of a shirt or smock and grew into a separate garment of fine linen, trimmed with lace, [[cutwork]] or embroidery, and shaped into crisp, precise folds with starch and heated irons.\n\n==General trends==\n[[File:Selskab i det frie.

As the Queen was always required to have a pure image, and although women's fashion became increasingly seductive, the idea of the perfect [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] women was never forgotten.<ref name=\"ELIZABETHAN ERA\">{{Cite web|title = ELIZABETHAN ERA|url = http://www.elizabethan-era.org.uk/|website = www.elizabethan-era.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}</ref>\n\n[[Elizabethan era]] had its own customs and social rules that were reflected in their fashion. Style would depend usually of social status and Elizabethans were bound to obey The Elizabethan Sumptuary Laws, which oversaw the style and materials worn.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Daily Life - Renaissance and Reformation Reference Library {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3426300034/daily-life.html|website = www.encyclopedia.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}</ref>\n\nElizabethan Sumptuary Laws were used to control behavior and to ensure that a specific structure was maintained. These set of rules were well known by all the English people and penalties for violating these Sumptuary Laws were harsh - fines, and most of the time ended in the loss of property, title and even life.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Putting on an Elizabethan Outfit|url = http://www.elizabethancostume.net/overview.html|website = www.elizabethancostume.net|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}</ref>\n\nRegarding to fabrics and materials for the clothes construction, only Royalty were permitted to wear [[Stoat|ermine]]. Other nobles (lesser ones) were allowed only to wear foxes and otters. Clothes worn during this era were mostly inspired by geometric shapes, probably derived from the high interest in science and mathematics from that era.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Copy of Everyday City Life in London, England During the Renaissance|url = https://prezi.com/cxbzy2uogx1p/copy-of-everyday-city-life-in-london-england-during-the-renaissance/|website = prezi.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}</ref> \"Padding and quilting together with the use of whalebone or [[Allium ursinum|buckram]] for stiffening purposes were used to gain geometric effect with emphasis on giving the illusion of a small waist\".<ref name=\"ELIZABETHAN ERA\"/>\n\nThe upper classes, too, were restricted.

The Low Countries, [[Germany|German states]], [[Scandinavia]], England, France, and Italy all absorbed the sobering and formal influence of Spanish dress after the mid-1520s. Fine textiles could be dyed \"in the grain\" (with the expensive [[kermes (dye)|kermes]]), alone or as an over-dye with woad, to produce a wide range colors from blacks and grays through browns, murreys, purples, and sanguines.<ref>Munro, John H. \"Medieval Woollens: Textiles, Technology, and Organisation\".

This distinction would carry over well into the [[1600\u20131650 in fashion|seventeenth century]].\n\n==Women's fashion==\n[[File:Elizabeth.of.Valois.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Spanish fashion: Elizabeth of Valois, Queen of Spain, wears a black gown with floor-length sleeves lined in white, with the cone-shaped skirts created by the Spanish farthingale, 1565.]]\n[[File:Nicholas Hilliard (called) - Portrait of Queen Elizabeth I - Google Art Project.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Elizabeth I wears padded shoulder rolls and an embroidered partlet and sleeves.

An alternative to the gown was a short jacket or a doublet cut with a high neckline.  The narrow-shouldered, wide-cuffed \"trumpet\" sleeves characteristic of the 1540s and 1550s in France and England disappeared in the 1560s, in favor of French and Spanish styles with narrower sleeves.  Overall, the silhouette was narrow through the 1560s and gradually widened, with emphasis as the shoulder and hip.  The slashing technique, seen in Italian dress in the 1560s, evolved into single or double rows of loops at the shoulder with contrasting linings.

Italian fashion uniquely featured a broad U-shape rather than a V.<ref name=\"Patterns\" /> Spanish women also wore boned, heavy corsets known as \"Spanish bodies\" that compressed the torso into a smaller but equally geometric cone.<ref>Kemper, Rachel H: \"Costume\", 1992, pp. 82</ref> Bodices could be high-necked or have a broad, low, square neckline, often with a slight arch at the front early in the period. They fastened with hooks in front or were laced at the side-back seam. High-necked bodices styled like men's doublets might fasten with hooks or buttons. Italian and German fashion retained the front-laced bodice of the previous period, with the ties laced in parallel rows.\n\n===Underwear===\n[[File:Elizabeth Vernon big.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Elizabeth Vernon at her dressing table wears an embroidered linen jacket over her rose-pink corset, 1590s.]]\n\nDuring this period, women's [[underwear]] consisted of a washable [[linen]] [[chemise|chemise or smock]]. This was the only article of clothing that was worn by every woman, regardless of class. Wealthy women's smocks were embroidered and trimmed with narrow [[lace]].  Smocks were made of rectangular lengths of linen; in northern Europe the smock skimmed the body and was widened with triangular gores, while in Mediterranean countries smocks were cut fuller in the body and sleeves.  High-necked smocks were worn under high-necked fashions, to protect the expensive outer garments from body oils and dirt.

The fashion spread from there to Italy, and then to France and (eventually) England, where it was called a ''pair of bodies'', being made in two parts which laced back and front.  The corset was restricted to aristocratic fashion, and was a fitted bodice stiffened with reeds called ''bents'', wood, or whalebone.<ref name=\"Tudor20\" /><ref name=\"Corset\">{{cite book|last=Steele|first=Valerie|title=The Corset: A Cultural History|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2001|isbn=978-030009071-0|pages=6\u201312}}</ref>\n\nSkirts were held in the proper shape by a [[farthingale]] or [[hoop skirt]]. In Spain, the cone-shaped ''Spanish farthingale'' remained in fashion into the early 17th century. It was only briefly fashionable in France, where a padded roll or ''French farthingale'' (called in England a ''bum roll'') held the skirts out in a rounded shape at the waist, falling in soft folds to the floor. In England, the Spanish farthingale was worn through the 1570s, and was gradually replaced by the French farthingale. By the 1590s, skirts were pinned to wide wheel farthingales to achieve a drum shape.<ref name=\"Patterns\" /><ref name=\"Tortora164\" /><ref name=\"Tudor21\">Mikhaila (2006), p. 21.</ref>\n\n===Partlet===\n{{main|Partlet}}\n\nA low neckline might be filled with an infill (called in English a ''partlet''). Partlets worn over the smock but under the kirtle and gown were typically made of [[lawn (textile)|lawn]] (a fine linen).  Partlets were also worn over the kirtle and gown. The colours of \"over-parlets\" varied, but white and black were the most common.

[[Hooded cloaks]] were worn overall in bad weather.  One description mentions strings being attached to the stirrup or foot to hold the skirts in place when riding.

Its name implies some military ideals and has been used since the beginning of the 16th century and therefore has many forms. The [[cloak]] is identified by its flaring out at the shoulders and the intricacy of decoration. The cloak was worn to the ankle, waist or fork. It also had specific measurements of 3/4 cut. The longer lengths were more popular for travel and came with many variations. These include: taller collars than normal, upturned collar or no collar at all and sleeves. The French cloak was quite the opposite of the Dutch and was worn anywhere from the knees to the ankle. It was typically worn over the left shoulder and included a cape that came to the elbow. It was a highly decorated cloak. The Spanish cloak or cape was well known to be stiff, have a very decorated hood and was worn to the hip or waist. The over-gown for women was very plain and worn loosely to the floor or ankle length. The Juppe had a relation to the safeguard and they would usually be worn together. The Juppe replaced the Dutch Cloak and was most likely a loose form of the doublet.<ref name=\"employees1\"/><ref>{{Cite book|title = Fashion and Fancy: Dress and Meaning in Rembrandt's Paintings|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WEQy3xkbU9cC|publisher = Amsterdam University Press|date = 2006-01-01|isbn = 9789053569177|first = Marieke de|last = Winkel}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA328908635&v=2.1&it=r&p=AONE&sw=w&asid=3d8aa28402007d8a834c302544b19127|title = Irish mantles, English nationalism: apparel and national identity in early modern English and Irish texts|last = Zeigler|first = John R.|date = 2013|journal = Journal for Early Modern Cultural Studies|volume = 13|pages = 73\u201395|doi = 10.1353/jem.2013.0001|pmid = |access-date = 23 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Accessories===\nThe fashion for wearing or carrying the [[Fur|pelt]] of a [[sable]] or [[marten]] spread from continental Europe into England in this period; costume historians call these accessories ''[[zibellino|zibellini]]'' or \"flea furs\". The most expensive zibellini had faces and paws of goldsmith's work with jewelled eyes. [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] received one as a New Years gift in 1584.<ref name=\"Med2\">Sherrill, Tawny: \"Fleas, Furs, and Fashions: ''Zibellini'' as Luxury Accessories of the Renaissance\", in Robin Netherton and Gale R. Owen-Crocker, editors, ''Medieval Clothing and Textiles'', Volume 2, pp. 121\u2013150</ref> Gloves of perfumed leather featured embroidered cuffs. Folding fans appeared late in the period, replacing flat fans of ostrich feathers.<ref name=\"QE\" />\n\nJewelry was also popular among those that could afford it. Necklaces were beaded gold or silver chains and worn in [[concentric]] circles reaching as far down as the waist. Ruffs also had a jewelry attachment such as glass beads, embroidery, gems, brooches or flowers. Belts were a surprising necessity: used either for fashion or more practical purposes. Lower classes wore them almost as tool belts with the upper classes using them as another place to add jewels and gems alike. Scarves, although not often mentioned, had a significant impact on the Elizabethan style by being a multipurpose piece of clothing. They could be worn on the head to protect desirable pale skin from the sun, warm the neck on a colder day, and accentuate the colour scheme of a gown or whole outfit. The upper class had silken scarves of every color to brighten up an outfit with the gold thread and tassels hanging off of it.\n\nWhile travelling, noblewomen would wear oval masks of black velvet called [[visard]]s to protect their faces from the sun.\n\n===Hairstyles and headgear===\n[[File:Circle of benson st cecilia detail.jpg|right|thumb|180px|In a typical hairstyle of the period, front hair is curled and back hair is worn long, twisted and wound with ribbons and then coiled and pinned up.]]\n[[File:Catherine de Medicis.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[Catherine de' Medici]] in a widow's black hood and veil, after 1559.]]\nMarried and grown women covered their hair, as they had in previous periods.<ref name=\"Tortora 1994, p. 167\">Tortora (1994), p. 167</ref> Early in the period, hair was parted in the center and fluffed over the temples. Later, front hair was curled and puffed high over the forehead. [[Wigs]] and false hairpieces were used to extend the hair.\n\nA close-fitting linen cap called a [[coif]] or ''biggins'' was worn, alone or under other hats or hoods, especially in the Netherlands and England. Many embroidered and bobbin-lace-trimmed English coifs survive from this period.<ref name=\"Digby\" /> \nThe [[French hood]] was worn throughout the period in both France and England. Another fashionable headdress was a [[caul (headgear)|caul]], or cap, of net-work lined in silk attached to a band, which covered the pinned up hair. This style of headdress had also been seen in Germany in the first half of the century.<ref>K\u00f6hler, ''History of Costume''</ref> Widows in [[mourning]] wore black hoods with sheer black veils.\n\n=== Makeup ===\n\nThe ideal standard of beauty for women in the Elizabethan era was to have light or naturally red hair, a pale complexion, and red cheeks and lips. Pale, white skin was desired because Queen Elizabeth was in reign and she had the naturally red hair, pale complexion, and red cheeks and lips. Also, it was to look very English since the main enemy of England was Spain, and in Spain darker hair was dominant.<ref name=\"The Painted Lady\">{{cite web|title=The Painted Lady-Tudor Portraits at the Ferens|url=http://www.mylearning.org/the-painted-lady--tudor-portraits-at-the-ferens/p-2281/|website=MyLearning|accessdate=12 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Beautiful With Brains\">{{cite web|title=Beauty History: The Elizabethan Era|url=http://beautifulwithbrains.com/2010/05/20/beauty-history-the-elizabethan-era/|website=Beautiful With Brains|accessdate=12 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213015209/http://beautifulwithbrains.com/2010/05/20/beauty-history-the-elizabethan-era/|archive-date=13 February 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nTo further enhance the desired pale complexion, women layered white make-up on their faces. This make-up, called [[Venetian Ceruse|Ceruse]], was made up of [[White Lead|white lead]] and vinegar. Women wearing ceruse achieved the white face, however, the white lead that was used to make it is poisonous. Women in this time often contracted [[Lead Poisoning|lead poisoning]] which resulted in deaths before the age of 50. Other ingredients used as make-up were sulfur, alum, and tin ash. In addition to using make-up to achieve the pale complexion, women in this era were bled to take the color out of their faces.<ref name=\"The Painted Lady\" /><ref name=\"Beautiful With Brains\" />\n\nFor the red cheeks and lips, dyes were sometimes used. [[Cochineal]], [[Rose madder|madder]] and [[vermilion]] were used as dyes to achieve the bright red effects on the face. Not only were the cheeks and lips emphasized; [[Kohl (cosmetics)|Kohl]] was used to darken the eyelashes and enhance the size and appearance of the eyes. <ref name=\"Beautiful With Brains\" />\n\n===Style gallery 1550s===\n<gallery>\nImage:Angelo Bronzino 060.jpg|1 \u2013 1550\u201355\nImage:Anthonis Mor 002.jpg|2 \u2013 1554\nImage:Mary1 by Eworth 2.jpg|3 \u2013 1554\nImage:Tizian 072.jpg|4 \u2013 1555\nImage:KatharinavonMedici.jpg|5 \u2013 c. 1555\n\nImage:Hans Eworth Unknown Woman 1557.jpg|6 \u2013 1557\nImage:Portrait of Bianca Ponzoni Anguissola, by Sofonisba Anguissola.jpg|7 \u2013 1557\nImage:Hans Eworth called Mary Fitzalan Duchess of Norfolk.jpg|8 - 1557\nImage:LadyDacre.jpg|9 \u2013 1555\u201358\n\n</gallery>\n# [[:Image:Angelo Bronzino 060.jpg|Florentine fashion]] of the early 1550s features a loose gown of light-weight silk over a bodice and skirt (or kirtle) and an open-necked partlet.\n# [[:Image:Anthonis Mor 002.jpg|Dutch fashion]] of 1554: A black gown with high puffed upper sleeves is worn over a black bodice and a gray skirt with black trim.

Long cloaks were worn in cold and wet weather. [[Gown]]s were increasingly old-fashioned, and were worn by older men for warmth indoors and out. In this period robes began their transition from general garments to traditional clothing of specific occupations, such as scholars (see [[Academic dress]]).\n\n===Hairstyles and headgear===\nHair was generally worn short, brushed back from the forehead. Longer styles were popular in the 1580s. In the 1590s, young men of fashion wore a ''[[lovelock (hair)|lovelock]]'', a long section of hair hanging over one shoulder.\n\nThrough the 1570s, a soft fabric [[hat]] with a gathered crown was worn. These derived from the ''flat hat'' of the previous period, and over time the hat was stiffened and the crown became taller and far from flat. Later, a conical felt hat with a rounded crown called a ''capotain'' or ''copotain'' became fashionable. These became very tall toward the end of century. Hats were decorated with a jewel or [[feather]], and were worn indoors and out.<ref name=\"Tortora 1994, p. 167\"/>\n\nClose-fitting caps covering the ears and tied under the chin called [[coif]]s continued to be worn by children and older men under their hats or alone indoors; men's coifs were usually black.\n\nA conical cap of linen with a turned up brim called a ''nightcap'' was worn informally indoors; these were often embroidered.<ref name=\"Digby\" />\n\n===Beards===\nAlthough beards were worn by many men prior to the mid-16th century, it was at this time when grooming and styling facial hair  gained social significance.  These styles would change very frequently, from pointed whiskers to round trims, throughout these few decades.

It resembles a large and discussed growth upon the chin.  \n*The ''Goat Beard'' resembles a [[goatee]].  It is also very similar to the'' 'Pick-a-devant ''and the ''Barbula'' style of beards. '' ''\n*The ''Peak'' was, at the time, a common name for the beard, but it referred specifically to a mustache finely groomed to a pointed tip.  \n*The ''Pencil Beard'' is a small portion of the beard easing to a point around the centre of the chin. \n*The ''Stiletto Beard'' is shaped similarly to the [[Stiletto|dagger]] in which it obtained its name.  \n*The ''Round Beard'', just as its name suggests, is trimmed to add emphasis to the roundness of the male cheekbones.  Another common name for this style was the ''Bush Beard''.\n*The ''Spade Beard'' derives from the design of a [[Spades (suit)|spade]] which belongs in a deck of playing cards.  The beard is broad on the higher part of the cheeks which then curves at each side to meet at the tip of the chin.  This style was thought to give a martial appearance and was favoured by soldiers.  \n*The ''Marquisetto''; a very sleek trim of the beard in which is cuts close to the chin.\n*The ''Swallow's Tail Beard'' is unique in a sense that it entails the groomer to take the hairs from the centre of the chin and separate the hairs toward opposite directions.  This is very common variation of the ''forked beard'', although it is greater in length and it is more noticeably spread apart.\n\n===Accessories===\nA baldrick or \"corse\" was a belt commonly worn diagonally across the chest or around the waist for holding items such swords, daggers, bugles, and horns.<ref name=\"cunnington2\">{{cite book|last=Cunnington|first=C.

Shoes and boots became narrower, followed the contours of the foot, and covered more of the foot, in some cases up to the ankle, than they had previously. As in the first half of the century, shoes were made from soft leather, velvet, or silk. In Spain, Italy, and Germany the slashing of shoes also persisted into the latter half of the century. In France however, slashing slowly went out of fashion and coloring the soles of footwear red began.

[[Shirt]]s and [[chemise]]s were [[embroider]]ed with [[blackwork]] and edged in [[lace]]. Heavy cut [[velvet]]s and [[brocade]]s were further ornamented with applied [[bobbin lace]], [[gold]] and [[silver]] embroidery, and [[Gemstone|jewels]].<ref name=\"Patterns\">Arnold, Janet: ''Patterns of Fashion: the cut and construction of clothes for men and women 1560\u20131620'', Macmillan 1985.

The Low Countries, [[Germany|German states]], [[Scandinavia]], England, France, and Italy all absorbed the sobering and formal influence of Spanish dress after the mid-1520s. Fine textiles could be dyed \"in the grain\" (with the expensive [[kermes (dye)|kermes]]), alone or as an over-dye with woad, to produce a wide range colors from blacks and grays through browns, murreys, purples, and sanguines.<ref>Munro, John H. \"Medieval Woollens: Textiles, Technology, and Organisation\".

This distinction would carry over well into the [[1600\u20131650 in fashion|seventeenth century]].\n\n==Women's fashion==\n[[File:Elizabeth.of.Valois.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Spanish fashion: Elizabeth of Valois, Queen of Spain, wears a black gown with floor-length sleeves lined in white, with the cone-shaped skirts created by the Spanish farthingale, 1565.]]\n[[File:Nicholas Hilliard (called) - Portrait of Queen Elizabeth I - Google Art Project.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Elizabeth I wears padded shoulder rolls and an embroidered partlet and sleeves.

An alternative to the gown was a short jacket or a doublet cut with a high neckline.  The narrow-shouldered, wide-cuffed \"trumpet\" sleeves characteristic of the 1540s and 1550s in France and England disappeared in the 1560s, in favor of French and Spanish styles with narrower sleeves.  Overall, the silhouette was narrow through the 1560s and gradually widened, with emphasis as the shoulder and hip.  The slashing technique, seen in Italian dress in the 1560s, evolved into single or double rows of loops at the shoulder with contrasting linings. By the 1580s these had been adapted in England as padded and jeweled ''shoulder rolls''.<ref name=\"QE\" /><ref name=\"Patterns\" /><ref name=\"Visual\">Ashelford, Jane: ''The Visual History of Costume: The Sixteenth Century'', 1983 edition ({{ISBN|0-89676-076-6}}), 1994 reprint ({{ISBN|0-7134-6828-9}})</ref><ref name=\"Tudor20\">{{cite book | last1 = Mikhaila | first1 = Ninya |last2 = Malcolm-Davies| first2 = Jane| title = The Tudor tailor: Reconstructing 16th-century dress | publisher = Batsford | location = London | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0713489859 |page=20}}</ref><ref name=\"Tortora164\">Tortora, Phyllis: ''A survey of historic costume: A history of Western dress'', New York: Fairchild Publications, 1994, {{ISBN|1563670038}}, pages 164\u2013165.</ref>\n\n===Gown, kirtle, and petticoat===\n\nThe common upper garment was a gown, called in Spanish ''ropa'', in French ''robe'', and in English either ''gown'' or ''frock''.  Gowns were made in a variety of styles: Loose or fitted (called in England a ''French gown''); with short ''half sleeves'' or long sleeves; and floor length (a ''round gowns'') or with a trailing [[train (clothing)]].<ref name=\"Tudor20\" /><ref name=\"Tortora164\" />\n\nThe gown was worn over a [[kirtle]] or [[petticoat]] (or both, for warmth). Prior to 1545, the kirtle consisted of a fitted one-piece garment.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ashelford|first=Jane|title=The Art of Dress Clothes and Society 1500-1915|year=1996|publisher=National Trust Enterprises Limited|location=Great Britain|isbn=978-0-8109-6317-7|pages=20}}</ref>   After that date, either kirtles or petticoats might have attached [[bodice]]s or ''bodies'' that fastened with lacing or [[hook and eye|hooks and eyes]] and most had sleeves that were pinned or laced in place. The parts of the kirtle or petticoat that showed beneath the gown were usually made of richer fabrics, especially the front panel ''forepart'' of the skirts.<ref name=\"Tudor20\" /><ref name=\"Tortora164\" />\n\nThe [[bodice]]s of French, Spanish, and English styles were stiffened into a cone or flattened, triangular shape ending in a V at the front of the woman's waist. Italian fashion uniquely featured a broad U-shape rather than a V.<ref name=\"Patterns\" /> Spanish women also wore boned, heavy corsets known as \"Spanish bodies\" that compressed the torso into a smaller but equally geometric cone.<ref>Kemper, Rachel H: \"Costume\", 1992, pp. 82</ref> Bodices could be high-necked or have a broad, low, square neckline, often with a slight arch at the front early in the period. They fastened with hooks in front or were laced at the side-back seam. High-necked bodices styled like men's doublets might fasten with hooks or buttons. Italian and German fashion retained the front-laced bodice of the previous period, with the ties laced in parallel rows.\n\n===Underwear===\n[[File:Elizabeth Vernon big.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Elizabeth Vernon at her dressing table wears an embroidered linen jacket over her rose-pink corset, 1590s.]]\n\nDuring this period, women's [[underwear]] consisted of a washable [[linen]] [[chemise|chemise or smock]]. This was the only article of clothing that was worn by every woman, regardless of class. Wealthy women's smocks were embroidered and trimmed with narrow [[lace]].  Smocks were made of rectangular lengths of linen; in northern Europe the smock skimmed the body and was widened with triangular gores, while in Mediterranean countries smocks were cut fuller in the body and sleeves.  High-necked smocks were worn under high-necked fashions, to protect the expensive outer garments from body oils and dirt.

The fashion spread from there to Italy, and then to France and (eventually) England, where it was called a ''pair of bodies'', being made in two parts which laced back and front.  The corset was restricted to aristocratic fashion, and was a fitted bodice stiffened with reeds called ''bents'', wood, or whalebone.<ref name=\"Tudor20\" /><ref name=\"Corset\">{{cite book|last=Steele|first=Valerie|title=The Corset: A Cultural History|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2001|isbn=978-030009071-0|pages=6\u201312}}</ref>\n\nSkirts were held in the proper shape by a [[farthingale]] or [[hoop skirt]]. In Spain, the cone-shaped ''Spanish farthingale'' remained in fashion into the early 17th century. It was only briefly fashionable in France, where a padded roll or ''French farthingale'' (called in England a ''bum roll'') held the skirts out in a rounded shape at the waist, falling in soft folds to the floor. In England, the Spanish farthingale was worn through the 1570s, and was gradually replaced by the French farthingale. By the 1590s, skirts were pinned to wide wheel farthingales to achieve a drum shape.<ref name=\"Patterns\" /><ref name=\"Tortora164\" /><ref name=\"Tudor21\">Mikhaila (2006), p. 21.</ref>\n\n===Partlet===\n{{main|Partlet}}\n\nA low neckline might be filled with an infill (called in English a ''partlet''). Partlets worn over the smock but under the kirtle and gown were typically made of [[lawn (textile)|lawn]] (a fine linen).  Partlets were also worn over the kirtle and gown. The colours of \"over-parlets\" varied, but white and black were the most common. The partlet might be made of the same material as the kirtle and richly decorated with lace detailing to complement it.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tammie L.

[[Hooded cloaks]] were worn overall in bad weather.  One description mentions strings being attached to the stirrup or foot to hold the skirts in place when riding. Mantles were also popular and described as modern day bench warmers: a square blanket or rug that is attached to the shoulder, worn around the body, or on the knees for extra warmth.<ref name=\"employees1\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.employees.org/~cathy/cote_body.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=27 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508135155/http://www.employees.org/~cathy/cote_body.html |archive-date=8 May 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA328908635&v=2.1&it=r&p=AONE&sw=w&asid=3d8aa28402007d8a834c302544b19127|title = Irish mantles, English nationalism: apparel and national identity in early modern English and Irish texts|last = Zeigler|first = John R.|date = 2013|journal = Journal for Early Modern Cultural Studies |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=73\u201395 |doi = 10.1353/jem.2013.0001|pmid = |access-date = 23 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nBesides keeping warm, Elizabethans cloaks were useful for any type of weather;\nthe [[Cassock]], commonly known as the Dutch cloak, was another kind of cloak. Its name implies some military ideals and has been used since the beginning of the 16th century and therefore has many forms. The [[cloak]] is identified by its flaring out at the shoulders and the intricacy of decoration. The cloak was worn to the ankle, waist or fork. It also had specific measurements of 3/4 cut. The longer lengths were more popular for travel and came with many variations. These include: taller collars than normal, upturned collar or no collar at all and sleeves. The French cloak was quite the opposite of the Dutch and was worn anywhere from the knees to the ankle. It was typically worn over the left shoulder and included a cape that came to the elbow. It was a highly decorated cloak. The Spanish cloak or cape was well known to be stiff, have a very decorated hood and was worn to the hip or waist. The over-gown for women was very plain and worn loosely to the floor or ankle length. The Juppe had a relation to the safeguard and they would usually be worn together. The Juppe replaced the Dutch Cloak and was most likely a loose form of the doublet.<ref name=\"employees1\"/><ref>{{Cite book|title = Fashion and Fancy: Dress and Meaning in Rembrandt's Paintings|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WEQy3xkbU9cC|publisher = Amsterdam University Press|date = 2006-01-01|isbn = 9789053569177|first = Marieke de|last = Winkel}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA328908635&v=2.1&it=r&p=AONE&sw=w&asid=3d8aa28402007d8a834c302544b19127|title = Irish mantles, English nationalism: apparel and national identity in early modern English and Irish texts|last = Zeigler|first = John R.|date = 2013|journal = Journal for Early Modern Cultural Studies|volume = 13|pages = 73\u201395|doi = 10.1353/jem.2013.0001|pmid = |access-date = 23 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Accessories===\nThe fashion for wearing or carrying the [[Fur|pelt]] of a [[sable]] or [[marten]] spread from continental Europe into England in this period; costume historians call these accessories ''[[zibellino|zibellini]]'' or \"flea furs\". The most expensive zibellini had faces and paws of goldsmith's work with jewelled eyes. [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] received one as a New Years gift in 1584.<ref name=\"Med2\">Sherrill, Tawny: \"Fleas, Furs, and Fashions: ''Zibellini'' as Luxury Accessories of the Renaissance\", in Robin Netherton and Gale R.

Folding fans appeared late in the period, replacing flat fans of ostrich feathers.<ref name=\"QE\" />\n\nJewelry was also popular among those that could afford it. Necklaces were beaded gold or silver chains and worn in [[concentric]] circles reaching as far down as the waist. Ruffs also had a jewelry attachment such as glass beads, embroidery, gems, brooches or flowers. Belts were a surprising necessity: used either for fashion or more practical purposes. Lower classes wore them almost as tool belts with the upper classes using them as another place to add jewels and gems alike. Scarves, although not often mentioned, had a significant impact on the Elizabethan style by being a multipurpose piece of clothing. They could be worn on the head to protect desirable pale skin from the sun, warm the neck on a colder day, and accentuate the colour scheme of a gown or whole outfit. The upper class had silken scarves of every color to brighten up an outfit with the gold thread and tassels hanging off of it.\n\nWhile travelling, noblewomen would wear oval masks of black velvet called [[visard]]s to protect their faces from the sun.\n\n===Hairstyles and headgear===\n[[File:Circle of benson st cecilia detail.jpg|right|thumb|180px|In a typical hairstyle of the period, front hair is curled and back hair is worn long, twisted and wound with ribbons and then coiled and pinned up.]]\n[[File:Catherine de Medicis.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[Catherine de' Medici]] in a widow's black hood and veil, after 1559.]]\nMarried and grown women covered their hair, as they had in previous periods.<ref name=\"Tortora 1994, p. 167\">Tortora (1994), p. 167</ref> Early in the period, hair was parted in the center and fluffed over the temples. Later, front hair was curled and puffed high over the forehead. [[Wigs]] and false hairpieces were used to extend the hair.\n\nA close-fitting linen cap called a [[coif]] or ''biggins'' was worn, alone or under other hats or hoods, especially in the Netherlands and England. Many embroidered and bobbin-lace-trimmed English coifs survive from this period.<ref name=\"Digby\" /> \nThe [[French hood]] was worn throughout the period in both France and England. Another fashionable headdress was a [[caul (headgear)|caul]], or cap, of net-work lined in silk attached to a band, which covered the pinned up hair. This style of headdress had also been seen in Germany in the first half of the century.<ref>K\u00f6hler, ''History of Costume''</ref> Widows in [[mourning]] wore black hoods with sheer black veils.\n\n=== Makeup ===\n\nThe ideal standard of beauty for women in the Elizabethan era was to have light or naturally red hair, a pale complexion, and red cheeks and lips. Pale, white skin was desired because Queen Elizabeth was in reign and she had the naturally red hair, pale complexion, and red cheeks and lips. Also, it was to look very English since the main enemy of England was Spain, and in Spain darker hair was dominant.<ref name=\"The Painted Lady\">{{cite web|title=The Painted Lady-Tudor Portraits at the Ferens|url=http://www.mylearning.org/the-painted-lady--tudor-portraits-at-the-ferens/p-2281/|website=MyLearning|accessdate=12 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Beautiful With Brains\">{{cite web|title=Beauty History: The Elizabethan Era|url=http://beautifulwithbrains.com/2010/05/20/beauty-history-the-elizabethan-era/|website=Beautiful With Brains|accessdate=12 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213015209/http://beautifulwithbrains.com/2010/05/20/beauty-history-the-elizabethan-era/|archive-date=13 February 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nTo further enhance the desired pale complexion, women layered white make-up on their faces. This make-up, called [[Venetian Ceruse|Ceruse]], was made up of [[White Lead|white lead]] and vinegar. Women wearing ceruse achieved the white face, however, the white lead that was used to make it is poisonous. Women in this time often contracted [[Lead Poisoning|lead poisoning]] which resulted in deaths before the age of 50. Other ingredients used as make-up were sulfur, alum, and tin ash. In addition to using make-up to achieve the pale complexion, women in this era were bled to take the color out of their faces.<ref name=\"The Painted Lady\" /><ref name=\"Beautiful With Brains\" />\n\nFor the red cheeks and lips, dyes were sometimes used. [[Cochineal]], [[Rose madder|madder]] and [[vermilion]] were used as dyes to achieve the bright red effects on the face.

''Trunk hose'' or ''round hose'' were short padded hose. Very short trunk hose were worn over ''cannions'', fitted hose that ended above the knee. Trunk hose could be ''paned'' or ''pansied'', with strips of fabric (''panes'') over a full inner layer or lining.  ''Slops'' or ''galligaskins'' were loose hose reaching just below the knee. Slops could also be ''pansied.''<ref name=\"Patterns\" /><ref name=\"Visual\" /><ref name=\"Tortora158\">Tortora (1994), pp. 158160.</ref>\n\n''Pluderhosen'' were a [[Northern Europe]]an form of pansied slops with a very full inner layer pulled out between the panes and hanging below the knee.<ref>Arnold, ''Patterns of Fashion...1560\u20131620'', pp. 16\u201318.</ref>\n\n''Venetians'' were semi-fitted hose reaching just below the knee.<ref name=\"Tortora158\" />\n\nMen wore [[stockings]] or ''netherstocks'' and flat [[shoes]] with rounded toes, with slashes early in the period and ties over the instep later. Boots were worn for riding.\n\n===Outerwear===\nShort [[cloak]]s or [[cape]]s, usually hip-length, often with [[sleeve]]s, or a military [[jacket]] like a [[mandilion]], were fashionable. Long cloaks were worn in cold and wet weather. [[Gown]]s were increasingly old-fashioned, and were worn by older men for warmth indoors and out. In this period robes began their transition from general garments to traditional clothing of specific occupations, such as scholars (see [[Academic dress]]).\n\n===Hairstyles and headgear===\nHair was generally worn short, brushed back from the forehead. Longer styles were popular in the 1580s. In the 1590s, young men of fashion wore a ''[[lovelock (hair)|lovelock]]'', a long section of hair hanging over one shoulder.\n\nThrough the 1570s, a soft fabric [[hat]] with a gathered crown was worn. These derived from the ''flat hat'' of the previous period, and over time the hat was stiffened and the crown became taller and far from flat. Later, a conical felt hat with a rounded crown called a ''capotain'' or ''copotain'' became fashionable. These became very tall toward the end of century. Hats were decorated with a jewel or [[feather]], and were worn indoors and out.<ref name=\"Tortora 1994, p. 167\"/>\n\nClose-fitting caps covering the ears and tied under the chin called [[coif]]s continued to be worn by children and older men under their hats or alone indoors; men's coifs were usually black.\n\nA conical cap of linen with a turned up brim called a ''nightcap'' was worn informally indoors; these were often embroidered.<ref name=\"Digby\" />\n\n===Beards===\nAlthough beards were worn by many men prior to the mid-16th century, it was at this time when grooming and styling facial hair  gained social significance.  These styles would change very frequently, from pointed whiskers to round trims, throughout these few decades.  The easiest way men were able to maintain the style of their beards was to apply starch onto their groomed faces.  The most popular styles of beards at this time include:<ref name=\"cunnington1960\">{{cite book|last=Cunnington|first=C.

It resembles a large and discussed growth upon the chin.  \n*The ''Goat Beard'' resembles a [[goatee]].  It is also very similar to the'' 'Pick-a-devant ''and the ''Barbula'' style of beards. '' ''\n*The ''Peak'' was, at the time, a common name for the beard, but it referred specifically to a mustache finely groomed to a pointed tip.  \n*The ''Pencil Beard'' is a small portion of the beard easing to a point around the centre of the chin. \n*The ''Stiletto Beard'' is shaped similarly to the [[Stiletto|dagger]] in which it obtained its name.  \n*The ''Round Beard'', just as its name suggests, is trimmed to add emphasis to the roundness of the male cheekbones.  Another common name for this style was the ''Bush Beard''.\n*The ''Spade Beard'' derives from the design of a [[Spades (suit)|spade]] which belongs in a deck of playing cards.  The beard is broad on the higher part of the cheeks which then curves at each side to meet at the tip of the chin.  This style was thought to give a martial appearance and was favoured by soldiers.  \n*The ''Marquisetto''; a very sleek trim of the beard in which is cuts close to the chin.\n*The ''Swallow's Tail Beard'' is unique in a sense that it entails the groomer to take the hairs from the centre of the chin and separate the hairs toward opposite directions.  This is very common variation of the ''forked beard'', although it is greater in length and it is more noticeably spread apart.\n\n===Accessories===\nA baldrick or \"corse\" was a belt commonly worn diagonally across the chest or around the waist for holding items such swords, daggers, bugles, and horns.<ref name=\"cunnington2\">{{cite book|last=Cunnington|first=C.

Shoes and boots became narrower, followed the contours of the foot, and covered more of the foot, in some cases up to the ankle, than they had previously. As in the first half of the century, shoes were made from soft leather, velvet, or silk. In Spain, Italy, and Germany the slashing of shoes also persisted into the latter half of the century.

[[Hat]]s, [[Chaperon (headgear)|hoods]], and other [[headdress]]es assumed increasing importance, and were draped, jewelled, and [[feather]]ed.\n\nAs Europe continued to grow more prosperous, the urban middle classes, skilled workers, began to wear more complex clothes that followed, at a distance, the fashions set by the elites. It is in this time period that we begin to see fashion take on a temporal aspect. People could now be dated by their clothes, and being in \"out of date\" clothing became a new social concern.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Elizabeth|title=Adorned in Dreams|year=1985|publisher=I.B.

Having added Holland and [[Flanders]] to their dominion, the Dukes of Burgundy had access to the latest [[fabrics]] of Italy and the East and to English wool exports through the great trading cities of [[Bruges]] and [[Antwerp]].<ref>Parry, ''History of Costume'', p. 199</ref>  Purchases of fabrics through Italian merchants like the two cousins [[Giovanni Arnolfini]] amounted to a noticeable proportion of all government expenditure.<ref>2% to the elder Giovanni alone, in 1444\u201346, p. 195 National Gallery Catalogues, The Fifteenth Century Netherlandish Paintings, Lorne Campbell, 1998, {{ISBN|1-85709-171-X}}</ref>  Especially in Florence, where [[sumptuary law]]s prevented the citizens from wearing the most luxurious cloths on which the city's fortunes were built, the materials of men's clothing in particular often appear plain in paintings, but contemporaries who understood the difference in grades of cloth very well would have appreciated the beauty and great expense of a very fine grade.<ref name=\"frick\">Frick, Carole Collier.

Stately floral designs featuring a [[pomegranate]] or [[artichoke]] motif had reached Europe from China in the 14th century and became a dominant design in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] silk-producing cities of Istanbul and [[Bursa]], and spread to silk weavers in [[Florence]], [[Genoa]], [[Venice]], [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] and [[Seville]] in this period.<ref name=\"Koslin\" /><ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_Of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=20&item=12%2E49%2E8&viewMode=0&section=description Late 15th century Italian (Venice) Velvet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art]</ref>\n\nFur was worn, mostly as a [[lining (sewing)|lining]] layer, by those who could afford it.  The grey and white squirrel furs of the Middle Ages, [[vair]] and [[miniver]], went out of style except at court, first for men and then for women; the new fashionable furs were dark brown [[sable]] and [[marten]].

In reality, images appear of sleeves with a single slashed opening as early as mid-15th century, although the German fashion for \"many small all-over slits\" may have begun here.<ref>Payne, op cit p. 241.</ref> Whatever its origin, the fad for multiple slashings spread to German [[Landsknechts]] and thence to France, Italy, and England, where it was to remain a potent current in fashionable attire into the mid-[[1600\u20131650 in fashion|17th century]].\n\nA second result of the defeat at Grandson was the decline of Burgundy as a fount of culture and fashion.  The heiress [[Mary of Burgundy]] married [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]] but died young.  In the last decade of the 15th century, [[Charles VIII of France]] [[Italian Wars|invaded Italy]] and was briefly declared [[Kingdom of Naples|King of Naples]].  As a result, the French nobility were introduced to the fabrics and styles of Italy, which would combine with German influence to become mainstream fashion of the nobility in France (and later spread to England) in the [[1500\u20131550 in fashion|first half of the 16th century]].<ref>Laver, ''Concise History of Costume and Fashion'', chapters 3 and 4 ''passim''</ref>\n\n==Women's fashion==\n\n===Dress, kirtle, and chemise===\n[[Image:Petrus Christus 004 detail.jpg|thumb|Fur-trimmed [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundia]]n gown of mid-15th century has a [[Shirt#Neck|V-neck]] that displays the black kirtle and a band of the chemise.

The sleeves were made detachable and were heavily ornamented.<ref>{{cite book|last=Laver|first=James|title=The Concise History of Costume and Fashion|publisher=Harry N. Abrams, Inc.|location=New York|page=74}}</ref>  The long-waisted silhouette of the [[1300\u20131400 in fashion|previous period]] was replaced by a high-waisted style with fullness over the belly, often confined by a belt.  The wide, shallow scooped neckline was replaced by a V-neck, often cut low enough to reveal the decorated front of the kirtle beneath.\n\nVarious styles of overdresses were worn. The ''[[:File:Plaid cotehardie.jpg|cotehardie]]'' fitted smoothly from the shoulders to the hips and then flared by means of inserted triangular gores.  It featured sleeves tight to the elbow with hanging streamers or ''tippets''. The tight fit was achieved with lacing or [[Button (clothing)|button]]s. This style faded rapidly from fashion in favor of the houppelande, a full robe with a high collar and wide sleeves that had become fashionable around 1380 and remained so to mid-15th century.<ref name=\"Payne\">Payne, Blanche: ''History of Costume from the Ancient Egyptians to the Twentieth Century'', Harper & Row, 1965.</ref> The later houppelande had sleeves that were snug at the wrist, making a full \"bag\" sleeve.  The bag sleeve was sometimes slashed in the front to allow the lower arm to reach through.\n\nAround 1450, the dress of northern Europe developed a low V-neck that showed a glimpse of the square-necked kirtle.  The neckline could be filled in with a sheer linen [[partlet]].  Wide turn-backs like revers displayed a contrasting lining, frequently of fur or black velvet, and the sleeves might be cuffed to match.  Sleeves were very long, covering half of the hand, and often highly decorated with embroidery.  Fine sleeves were often transferred from one dress to another.  The term ''robe d\u00e9guis\u00e9e'' was coined in the mid-1400s to describe garments reflecting the very latest fashions, a term which endured into the 16th century.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cosman|first=Madeleine Pelner|title=Handbook to Life in the Medieval World, 3-Volume Set|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1438109077|pages=868|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-Jf5t1vFw1QC&pg=PA868}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Lewandowski|first=Elizabeth J.|title=The complete costume dictionary|year=2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press, Inc.|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=978-0810877856|pages=251|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gbIsJ2tZJS4C&pg=PA251}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Cressot|first=Marcel|title=Vocabulaire des Quinze joyes de mariage: d'apr\u00e8s le texte de la seconde \u00e9dition de la Biblioth\u00e8que elz\u00e9virienne de 1857|year=1939|publisher=Slatkine|pages=42|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eZ4W11DIzJIC&pg=PA42}}</ref>\n\nIn Italy, the low scoop-neck of the early decades gave way to a neckline that was high in front with a lower V-neck at the back at mid-15th century.  This was followed by a V-neckline that displayed the kirtle or ''gamurra'' (sometimes spelled ''camorra'').  Sleeveless overdresses such as the ''cioppa'' were popular, and the gamurra sleeves displayed were often of rich figured silks.  The ''{{vanchor|cotta}}'' was a lighter-weight underdress for summerwear.  A sideless overdress called the ''giornea'' was worn with the gamurra or cotta.  Toward the end of the period, sleeves were made in sections or panels and slashed, allowing the full chemise sleeves below to be pulled through in puffs along the arm, at the shoulder, and at the elbow.  This was the beginning of the fashion for puffed and slashed sleeves that would last for two centuries.<ref name=\"Payne\" /><ref>Condra 2008, p. 22</ref>\n\nThe ''partlet'', a separate item to fill in a low neckline, appeared in this period, usually of sheer fabric (linen or possibly silk) with an open V-neckline. Some partlets have a collar and a back similar to the upper part of a shirt.  Burgundian partlets are usually depicted worn under the dress (but over the kirtle); in Italy the partlet seems to have been worn over the dress and could be pointed or cut straight across at the lower front.\n\nTwo uniquely Spanish fashions appear from the 1470s. The ''{{lang|es|verdugada}}'' or ''{{lang|es|verdugado}}'' was a gown with a bell-shaped [[hoop skirt]] with visible casings stiffened with reeds, which would become the [[farthingale]].  The earliest depictions of this garment come from [[Catalonia]], where it is worn with pieced or slashed sleeves and the second new style, a chemise with trumpet sleeves, open and very wide at the wrist.<ref name=\"Boucher\" />\n\nThe sideless surcoat of the [[1300\u20131400 in fashion|14th century]] became fossilized as a ceremonial costume for royalty, usually with an ermine front panel (called a ''plackard'' or ''placket'') and a mantle draped from the shoulders; it can be seen in variety of royal portraits and as \"shorthand\" to identify queens in illuminated manuscripts of the period.\n\n===Hairstyles and headdresses===\n\nA variety of hats and headdresses were worn in Europe in the 15th century. The ''crespine'' of Northern Europe, originally a thick hairnet or [[snood (headgear)|snood]], had evolved into a mesh of jeweler's work that confined the hair on the sides of the head by the end of the 14th century.  Gradually the fullness at the sides of head was pulled up to the temples and became pointed, like horns (''\u00e0 corn\u00e9'').<ref name=\"Payne\" /> By mid-15th century, the hair was pulled back from the forehead, and the crespine, now usually called a ''caul'', sat on the back of the head.  Very fashionable women shaved their foreheads and eyebrows. Any of these styles could be topped by a padded roll, sometimes arranged in a heart-shape, or a veil, or both. [[Veil]]s were supported by wire frames that exaggerated the shape and were variously draped from the back of the headdress or covered the forehead.\n\nWomen also wore the [[Chaperon (headgear)|chaperon]], a draped hat based on the [[hood (headgear)|hood]] and [[liripipe]], and a variety of related draped and wrapped [[turban]]s.\n\nThe most extravagant headdress of Burgundian fashion is the [[hennin]], a cone or truncated-cone shaped cap with a wire frame covered in fabric and topped by a floating veil.  Later hennins feature a turned-back brim, or are worn over a hood with a turned-back brim.<ref>M.

Payne, \"Women's Costume of the Fifteenth Century\", History of Costume: From the Ancient Egyptians to the Twentieth Century (1965)</ref> Towards the end of the 15th century women's head-dresses became smaller, more convenient, and less picturesque.

McBride & Company|location=New York|page=83}}</ref>\n\nWomen of the merchant classes in Northern Europe wore modified versions of courtly hairstyles, with coifs or caps, veils, and [[wimple]]s of crisp linen (often with visible creases from ironing and folding). A brief fashion added rows of gathered frills to the coif or veil; this style is sometimes known by the German name ''{{lang|de|kruseler}}''.<ref name=\"Kohler\">K\u00f5hler, ''History of Costume''</ref>\n\nThe general European convention of completely covering married women's hair was not accepted in warmer Italy.<ref name=\"Payne\" />  Italian women wore their hair very long, wound with ribbons or braided, and twisted up into knots of various shapes with the ends hanging free.  The hair was then covered with sheer veils or small caps.  Toward the 1480s women wore chin-length sections of hair in loose waves or ripples over the ears (a style that would inspire \"vintage\" hair fashions in the [[1600\u20131650 in fashion|1620s and '30s]] and again in the [[1840s in fashion|1840s]] and [[1850s in fashion|1850s]]).  Blond hair was considered desirable (by [[Botticelli]] for one), and visitors to Venice reported that ladies sat out in the sun on their terraces with their hair spread out around large circular disks worn like hats, attempting to bleach it in the sun.  Chemical methods were also used.<ref>For the fashion of bleached blond hair in Venice, see Tortora and Eubanks 1994, p. 146</ref>\n\n===Women's footwear===\nWomen from the 14th century wore laced ankle-boots, which were often lined with fur.

Italy, 1495]]\n\n===Shirt, doublet, and hose===\nThe basic costume of men in this period consisted of a shirt, doublet, and hose, with some sort of overrobe (robe worn over clothing).\n\nLinen shirts were worn next to the skin.  Toward the end of the period, shirts (French ''[[chemise]]'', Italian ''camicia'', Spanish ''camisa'') began to be full through the body and sleeves with wide, low necklines; the sleeves were pulled through the slashings or piecing of the doublet sleeves to make puffs, especially at the elbow and the back of the arm.  As the cut of doublets revealed more fabric, wealthy men's shirts were often decorated with [[embroidery]] or applied braid.\n\nOver the shirt was worn a [[Doublet (clothing)|doublet]].  From around the mid-15th century very tight-fitting doublets, belted or tailored to be tight at the waist, giving in effect a short skirt below, were fashionable, at least for the young. Sleeves were generally full, even puffy, and when worn with a large chaperon, the look was extremely stylish, but very top-heavy.  Very tight hose, and long pointed shoes or thigh-boots gave a long attenuated appearance below the waist, and a chunky, solid one above.  The doublet was often elaborately pleated, especially at the back, the pleats being achieved by various means.  In Italy both shirt and doublet were often high, tight and collarless at the front of the neck; sometimes they are shown higher at the front than the back.\n\nMen of all classes wore short ''braies'' or [[Breeches#Etymology|breeches]], a loose undergarment, usually made of linen, which was held up by a belt.  [[Hose (clothing)|Hose]] or [[chausses]] made out of wool were used to cover the legs, and were generally brightly colored.  Early hose sometimes had leather soles and were worn without shoes or boots.  Hose were generally tied to the breech belt, or to the breeches themselves, or to a doublet.\n\nAs doublets became shorter, hose reached to the waist rather than the hips, and were sewn together into a single garment with a pouch or flap to cover the front opening; this evolved into the [[codpiece]].\n\nThe hose exposed by short tops were, especially in Italy late in the 15th century, often strikingly patterned, parti-coloured (different colours for each leg, or vertically divided), or embroidered. Hose were cut on the [[bias (textile)|cross-grain or bias]] for stretch.<ref name=\"Kohler\" />\n\n===Overrobes and outerwear===\nThe [[Houppelande]], in Italy called the ''{{lang|it|cioppa}}'', is the characteristic overgarment of the wealthy in the first half of the 15th century.<ref name=\"Laver\">Laver, ''Concise History of Costume and Fashion''</ref>  It was essentially a robe with fullness falling from the shoulders in organ pleats<ref>Parry, ''History of Costume''</ref> and very full sleeves often reaching to the floor with, at the start of the 16th century, a high collar.  The houppelande could be lined in fur, and the hem and sleeves might be dagged or cut into scallops.  It was initially often worn belted, but later mostly hanging straight.  The length of the garment shortened from around the ankle to above the knee over this period.  The floor-length sleeves were later wrist-length but very full, forming a bag or sack sleeve, or were worn off the arm, hanging ornamentally behind.\n\nA sideless tunic or [[tabard]], called a ''giornea'' in Italy and a ''[[journade]]'' in France,<ref>Boucher, Fran\u00e7ois: ''20,000 Years of Fashion'', p, 197</ref> was popular.  It was usually pleated and was worn hanging loose or belted.  Young men wore them short and older men wore them calf- or ankle-length.\n\nThe middle of the 15th century in Burgundy saw what seems to have been the earliest occurrence of the male fashion for dressing all in black, which was to reappear so strongly in the \"Spanish\" style of the mid-16th\u201317th century and again in the 19th\u201320th centuries.  This was apparently begun by Duke [[Philip the Good]].<ref>Anne Hollander, ''Seeing through Clothes'',1978, The Viking Press, {{ISBN|0-380-48777-2}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Venice]], the patrician class, after the age of joining the [[Senate of Venice|Great Council]], wore their long red robes as a uniform virtually unchanged throughout the 15th century.  In contrast, the young men and the famous [[courtesan]]s of the city dressed very extravagantly.\n\nIn the last decades of the 15th century, a new style of overgown appeared; this was of various lengths, generally worn unbelted, and featured wide turned back revers and collar.<ref>Parry, ''History of Costume'', pp. 219\u201320</ref>\n\nShort or long [[cloak]]s or mantles were worn overall for ceremonial occasions and in bad weather; these typically fastened on one shoulder.\n\n===Headgear===\n[[Image:Italienischer Meister des 15.

In Germany, and briefly in Venice, a wide shock of frizzy blond hair was often seen on images of lovers (and angels) in the later part of the 15th century\u2014less often in portraits.   By the end of the 15th century, shoulder-length hair became fashionable, a trend that would continue into the [[1500\u20131550 in fashion|early 16th century]].\n{{clear}}\n\n===Style gallery 1400\u20131450===\n<gallery>\nImage:Livre de Chasse 51v.jpg|1 \u2013 1405\u201310\nImage:John the Fearless D of Burgundy.jpg|2 \u2013 1400\u201319\nImage:Masaccio 032.jpg|3 \u2013 c. 1425\nImage:Jan van Eyck 091.jpg|4 \u2013 1433\nImage:Anoniem_-_Koning_Johan_I_van_Portugal_(1450-1500)_-_Lissabon_Museu_Nacional_de_Arte_Antiga_19-10-2010_16-12-61.jpg|5 \u2013 c.1435\nImage:Chancellor_Rolin_detail.jpg|6 \u2013 c.1435\nImage:Chausses 1440 Cleeves.jpg|7 \u2013 1440\nImage:Pellegrinaio Santa Maria della Scala n4 detail.jpg|8 \u2013 1442\nImage:Van der weyden miniature detail Philip.jpg|9 \u2013 1447\u20138\n</gallery>\n#[[:Image:Livre de Chasse 51v.jpg|The lord]] on the left wears a long figured houppelande with full sleeves lined in fur, while the men of his household wear short solid-coloured overrobes with parti-coloured or matching hose.

[[Hat]]s, [[Chaperon (headgear)|hoods]], and other [[headdress]]es assumed increasing importance, and were draped, jewelled, and [[feather]]ed.\n\nAs Europe continued to grow more prosperous, the urban middle classes, skilled workers, began to wear more complex clothes that followed, at a distance, the fashions set by the elites. It is in this time period that we begin to see fashion take on a temporal aspect. People could now be dated by their clothes, and being in \"out of date\" clothing became a new social concern.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Elizabeth|title=Adorned in Dreams|year=1985|publisher=I.B.

Having added Holland and [[Flanders]] to their dominion, the Dukes of Burgundy had access to the latest [[fabrics]] of Italy and the East and to English wool exports through the great trading cities of [[Bruges]] and [[Antwerp]].<ref>Parry, ''History of Costume'', p. 199</ref>  Purchases of fabrics through Italian merchants like the two cousins [[Giovanni Arnolfini]] amounted to a noticeable proportion of all government expenditure.<ref>2% to the elder Giovanni alone, in 1444\u201346, p. 195 National Gallery Catalogues, The Fifteenth Century Netherlandish Paintings, Lorne Campbell, 1998, {{ISBN|1-85709-171-X}}</ref>  Especially in Florence, where [[sumptuary law]]s prevented the citizens from wearing the most luxurious cloths on which the city's fortunes were built, the materials of men's clothing in particular often appear plain in paintings, but contemporaries who understood the difference in grades of cloth very well would have appreciated the beauty and great expense of a very fine grade.<ref name=\"frick\">Frick, Carole Collier.

Stately floral designs featuring a [[pomegranate]] or [[artichoke]] motif had reached Europe from China in the 14th century and became a dominant design in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] silk-producing cities of Istanbul and [[Bursa]], and spread to silk weavers in [[Florence]], [[Genoa]], [[Venice]], [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] and [[Seville]] in this period.<ref name=\"Koslin\" /><ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_Of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=20&item=12%2E49%2E8&viewMode=0&section=description Late 15th century Italian (Venice) Velvet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art]</ref>\n\nFur was worn, mostly as a [[lining (sewing)|lining]] layer, by those who could afford it.  The grey and white squirrel furs of the Middle Ages, [[vair]] and [[miniver]], went out of style except at court, first for men and then for women; the new fashionable furs were dark brown [[sable]] and [[marten]].

In reality, images appear of sleeves with a single slashed opening as early as mid-15th century, although the German fashion for \"many small all-over slits\" may have begun here.<ref>Payne, op cit p. 241.</ref> Whatever its origin, the fad for multiple slashings spread to German [[Landsknechts]] and thence to France, Italy, and England, where it was to remain a potent current in fashionable attire into the mid-[[1600\u20131650 in fashion|17th century]].\n\nA second result of the defeat at Grandson was the decline of Burgundy as a fount of culture and fashion.  The heiress [[Mary of Burgundy]] married [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]] but died young.  In the last decade of the 15th century, [[Charles VIII of France]] [[Italian Wars|invaded Italy]] and was briefly declared [[Kingdom of Naples|King of Naples]].  As a result, the French nobility were introduced to the fabrics and styles of Italy, which would combine with German influence to become mainstream fashion of the nobility in France (and later spread to England) in the [[1500\u20131550 in fashion|first half of the 16th century]].<ref>Laver, ''Concise History of Costume and Fashion'', chapters 3 and 4 ''passim''</ref>\n\n==Women's fashion==\n\n===Dress, kirtle, and chemise===\n[[Image:Petrus Christus 004 detail.jpg|thumb|Fur-trimmed [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundia]]n gown of mid-15th century has a [[Shirt#Neck|V-neck]] that displays the black kirtle and a band of the chemise.

The sleeves were made detachable and were heavily ornamented.<ref>{{cite book|last=Laver|first=James|title=The Concise History of Costume and Fashion|publisher=Harry N. Abrams, Inc.|location=New York|page=74}}</ref>  The long-waisted silhouette of the [[1300\u20131400 in fashion|previous period]] was replaced by a high-waisted style with fullness over the belly, often confined by a belt.  The wide, shallow scooped neckline was replaced by a V-neck, often cut low enough to reveal the decorated front of the kirtle beneath.\n\nVarious styles of overdresses were worn. The ''[[:File:Plaid cotehardie.jpg|cotehardie]]'' fitted smoothly from the shoulders to the hips and then flared by means of inserted triangular gores.  It featured sleeves tight to the elbow with hanging streamers or ''tippets''. The tight fit was achieved with lacing or [[Button (clothing)|button]]s. This style faded rapidly from fashion in favor of the houppelande, a full robe with a high collar and wide sleeves that had become fashionable around 1380 and remained so to mid-15th century.<ref name=\"Payne\">Payne, Blanche: ''History of Costume from the Ancient Egyptians to the Twentieth Century'', Harper & Row, 1965.</ref> The later houppelande had sleeves that were snug at the wrist, making a full \"bag\" sleeve.  The bag sleeve was sometimes slashed in the front to allow the lower arm to reach through.\n\nAround 1450, the dress of northern Europe developed a low V-neck that showed a glimpse of the square-necked kirtle.  The neckline could be filled in with a sheer linen [[partlet]].  Wide turn-backs like revers displayed a contrasting lining, frequently of fur or black velvet, and the sleeves might be cuffed to match.  Sleeves were very long, covering half of the hand, and often highly decorated with embroidery.  Fine sleeves were often transferred from one dress to another.  The term ''robe d\u00e9guis\u00e9e'' was coined in the mid-1400s to describe garments reflecting the very latest fashions, a term which endured into the 16th century.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cosman|first=Madeleine Pelner|title=Handbook to Life in the Medieval World, 3-Volume Set|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1438109077|pages=868|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-Jf5t1vFw1QC&pg=PA868}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Lewandowski|first=Elizabeth J.|title=The complete costume dictionary|year=2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press, Inc.|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=978-0810877856|pages=251|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gbIsJ2tZJS4C&pg=PA251}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Cressot|first=Marcel|title=Vocabulaire des Quinze joyes de mariage: d'apr\u00e8s le texte de la seconde \u00e9dition de la Biblioth\u00e8que elz\u00e9virienne de 1857|year=1939|publisher=Slatkine|pages=42|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eZ4W11DIzJIC&pg=PA42}}</ref>\n\nIn Italy, the low scoop-neck of the early decades gave way to a neckline that was high in front with a lower V-neck at the back at mid-15th century.  This was followed by a V-neckline that displayed the kirtle or ''gamurra'' (sometimes spelled ''camorra'').  Sleeveless overdresses such as the ''cioppa'' were popular, and the gamurra sleeves displayed were often of rich figured silks.  The ''{{vanchor|cotta}}'' was a lighter-weight underdress for summerwear.  A sideless overdress called the ''giornea'' was worn with the gamurra or cotta.  Toward the end of the period, sleeves were made in sections or panels and slashed, allowing the full chemise sleeves below to be pulled through in puffs along the arm, at the shoulder, and at the elbow.  This was the beginning of the fashion for puffed and slashed sleeves that would last for two centuries.<ref name=\"Payne\" /><ref>Condra 2008, p. 22</ref>\n\nThe ''partlet'', a separate item to fill in a low neckline, appeared in this period, usually of sheer fabric (linen or possibly silk) with an open V-neckline. Some partlets have a collar and a back similar to the upper part of a shirt.  Burgundian partlets are usually depicted worn under the dress (but over the kirtle); in Italy the partlet seems to have been worn over the dress and could be pointed or cut straight across at the lower front.\n\nTwo uniquely Spanish fashions appear from the 1470s. The ''{{lang|es|verdugada}}'' or ''{{lang|es|verdugado}}'' was a gown with a bell-shaped [[hoop skirt]] with visible casings stiffened with reeds, which would become the [[farthingale]].  The earliest depictions of this garment come from [[Catalonia]], where it is worn with pieced or slashed sleeves and the second new style, a chemise with trumpet sleeves, open and very wide at the wrist.<ref name=\"Boucher\" />\n\nThe sideless surcoat of the [[1300\u20131400 in fashion|14th century]] became fossilized as a ceremonial costume for royalty, usually with an ermine front panel (called a ''plackard'' or ''placket'') and a mantle draped from the shoulders; it can be seen in variety of royal portraits and as \"shorthand\" to identify queens in illuminated manuscripts of the period.\n\n===Hairstyles and headdresses===\n\nA variety of hats and headdresses were worn in Europe in the 15th century. The ''crespine'' of Northern Europe, originally a thick hairnet or [[snood (headgear)|snood]], had evolved into a mesh of jeweler's work that confined the hair on the sides of the head by the end of the 14th century.  Gradually the fullness at the sides of head was pulled up to the temples and became pointed, like horns (''\u00e0 corn\u00e9'').<ref name=\"Payne\" /> By mid-15th century, the hair was pulled back from the forehead, and the crespine, now usually called a ''caul'', sat on the back of the head.  Very fashionable women shaved their foreheads and eyebrows. Any of these styles could be topped by a padded roll, sometimes arranged in a heart-shape, or a veil, or both. [[Veil]]s were supported by wire frames that exaggerated the shape and were variously draped from the back of the headdress or covered the forehead.\n\nWomen also wore the [[Chaperon (headgear)|chaperon]], a draped hat based on the [[hood (headgear)|hood]] and [[liripipe]], and a variety of related draped and wrapped [[turban]]s.\n\nThe most extravagant headdress of Burgundian fashion is the [[hennin]], a cone or truncated-cone shaped cap with a wire frame covered in fabric and topped by a floating veil.  Later hennins feature a turned-back brim, or are worn over a hood with a turned-back brim.<ref>M.

A brief fashion added rows of gathered frills to the coif or veil; this style is sometimes known by the German name ''{{lang|de|kruseler}}''.<ref name=\"Kohler\">K\u00f5hler, ''History of Costume''</ref>\n\nThe general European convention of completely covering married women's hair was not accepted in warmer Italy.<ref name=\"Payne\" />  Italian women wore their hair very long, wound with ribbons or braided, and twisted up into knots of various shapes with the ends hanging free.  The hair was then covered with sheer veils or small caps.  Toward the 1480s women wore chin-length sections of hair in loose waves or ripples over the ears (a style that would inspire \"vintage\" hair fashions in the [[1600\u20131650 in fashion|1620s and '30s]] and again in the [[1840s in fashion|1840s]] and [[1850s in fashion|1850s]]).  Blond hair was considered desirable (by [[Botticelli]] for one), and visitors to Venice reported that ladies sat out in the sun on their terraces with their hair spread out around large circular disks worn like hats, attempting to bleach it in the sun.  Chemical methods were also used.<ref>For the fashion of bleached blond hair in Venice, see Tortora and Eubanks 1994, p. 146</ref>\n\n===Women's footwear===\nWomen from the 14th century wore laced ankle-boots, which were often lined with fur. Later in the 15th century, women also wore \"poulaines\".

Italy, 1495]]\n\n===Shirt, doublet, and hose===\nThe basic costume of men in this period consisted of a shirt, doublet, and hose, with some sort of overrobe (robe worn over clothing).\n\nLinen shirts were worn next to the skin.  Toward the end of the period, shirts (French ''[[chemise]]'', Italian ''camicia'', Spanish ''camisa'') began to be full through the body and sleeves with wide, low necklines; the sleeves were pulled through the slashings or piecing of the doublet sleeves to make puffs, especially at the elbow and the back of the arm.  As the cut of doublets revealed more fabric, wealthy men's shirts were often decorated with [[embroidery]] or applied braid.\n\nOver the shirt was worn a [[Doublet (clothing)|doublet]].  From around the mid-15th century very tight-fitting doublets, belted or tailored to be tight at the waist, giving in effect a short skirt below, were fashionable, at least for the young. Sleeves were generally full, even puffy, and when worn with a large chaperon, the look was extremely stylish, but very top-heavy.  Very tight hose, and long pointed shoes or thigh-boots gave a long attenuated appearance below the waist, and a chunky, solid one above.  The doublet was often elaborately pleated, especially at the back, the pleats being achieved by various means.  In Italy both shirt and doublet were often high, tight and collarless at the front of the neck; sometimes they are shown higher at the front than the back.\n\nMen of all classes wore short ''braies'' or [[Breeches#Etymology|breeches]], a loose undergarment, usually made of linen, which was held up by a belt.  [[Hose (clothing)|Hose]] or [[chausses]] made out of wool were used to cover the legs, and were generally brightly colored.  Early hose sometimes had leather soles and were worn without shoes or boots.  Hose were generally tied to the breech belt, or to the breeches themselves, or to a doublet.\n\nAs doublets became shorter, hose reached to the waist rather than the hips, and were sewn together into a single garment with a pouch or flap to cover the front opening; this evolved into the [[codpiece]].\n\nThe hose exposed by short tops were, especially in Italy late in the 15th century, often strikingly patterned, parti-coloured (different colours for each leg, or vertically divided), or embroidered. Hose were cut on the [[bias (textile)|cross-grain or bias]] for stretch.<ref name=\"Kohler\" />\n\n===Overrobes and outerwear===\nThe [[Houppelande]], in Italy called the ''{{lang|it|cioppa}}'', is the characteristic overgarment of the wealthy in the first half of the 15th century.<ref name=\"Laver\">Laver, ''Concise History of Costume and Fashion''</ref>  It was essentially a robe with fullness falling from the shoulders in organ pleats<ref>Parry, ''History of Costume''</ref> and very full sleeves often reaching to the floor with, at the start of the 16th century, a high collar.  The houppelande could be lined in fur, and the hem and sleeves might be dagged or cut into scallops.  It was initially often worn belted, but later mostly hanging straight.  The length of the garment shortened from around the ankle to above the knee over this period.  The floor-length sleeves were later wrist-length but very full, forming a bag or sack sleeve, or were worn off the arm, hanging ornamentally behind.\n\nA sideless tunic or [[tabard]], called a ''giornea'' in Italy and a ''[[journade]]'' in France,<ref>Boucher, Fran\u00e7ois: ''20,000 Years of Fashion'', p, 197</ref> was popular.  It was usually pleated and was worn hanging loose or belted.  Young men wore them short and older men wore them calf- or ankle-length.\n\nThe middle of the 15th century in Burgundy saw what seems to have been the earliest occurrence of the male fashion for dressing all in black, which was to reappear so strongly in the \"Spanish\" style of the mid-16th\u201317th century and again in the 19th\u201320th centuries.  This was apparently begun by Duke [[Philip the Good]].<ref>Anne Hollander, ''Seeing through Clothes'',1978, The Viking Press, {{ISBN|0-380-48777-2}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Venice]], the patrician class, after the age of joining the [[Senate of Venice|Great Council]], wore their long red robes as a uniform virtually unchanged throughout the 15th century.  In contrast, the young men and the famous [[courtesan]]s of the city dressed very extravagantly.\n\nIn the last decades of the 15th century, a new style of overgown appeared; this was of various lengths, generally worn unbelted, and featured wide turned back revers and collar.<ref>Parry, ''History of Costume'', pp. 219\u201320</ref>\n\nShort or long [[cloak]]s or mantles were worn overall for ceremonial occasions and in bad weather; these typically fastened on one shoulder.\n\n===Headgear===\n[[Image:Italienischer Meister des 15.

In Germany, and briefly in Venice, a wide shock of frizzy blond hair was often seen on images of lovers (and angels) in the later part of the 15th century\u2014less often in portraits.   By the end of the 15th century, shoulder-length hair became fashionable, a trend that would continue into the [[1500\u20131550 in fashion|early 16th century]].\n{{clear}}\n\n===Style gallery 1400\u20131450===\n<gallery>\nImage:Livre de Chasse 51v.jpg|1 \u2013 1405\u201310\nImage:John the Fearless D of Burgundy.jpg|2 \u2013 1400\u201319\nImage:Masaccio 032.jpg|3 \u2013 c. 1425\nImage:Jan van Eyck 091.jpg|4 \u2013 1433\nImage:Anoniem_-_Koning_Johan_I_van_Portugal_(1450-1500)_-_Lissabon_Museu_Nacional_de_Arte_Antiga_19-10-2010_16-12-61.jpg|5 \u2013 c.1435\nImage:Chancellor_Rolin_detail.jpg|6 \u2013 c.1435\nImage:Chausses 1440 Cleeves.jpg|7 \u2013 1440\nImage:Pellegrinaio Santa Maria della Scala n4 detail.jpg|8 \u2013 1442\nImage:Van der weyden miniature detail Philip.jpg|9 \u2013 1447\u20138\n</gallery>\n#[[:Image:Livre de Chasse 51v.jpg|The lord]] on the left wears a long figured houppelande with full sleeves lined in fur, while the men of his household wear short solid-coloured overrobes with parti-coloured or matching hose.

Waistlines rose through the period for both men and women. Other notable fashions included full, slashed [[sleeve]]s and tall or broad [[hat]]s with brims. For men, [[hose (clothing)|hose]] disappeared in favour of [[breeches]].\n\n[[File:Rubens isabella brant c1610.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The artist [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] with his first wife c. 1610. Her long, rounded stomacher and jacket-like bodice are characteristic [[Netherlands|Dutch]] fashions]]\nThe silhouette, which was essentially close to the body with tight [[sleeve]]s and a low, pointed waist to around 1615, gradually softened and broadened. Sleeves became very full, and in the 1620s and 1630s were often paned or slashed to show the voluminous sleeves of the [[shirt]] or [[chemise]] beneath.\n\n[[Spain|Spanish]] fashions remained very conservative. The ruff lingered longest in Spain and the [[Netherlands]], but disappeared first for men and later for women in [[France]] and [[England]].\n\nThe social tensions leading to the [[English Civil War]] were reflected in English fashion, with the elaborate French styles popular at the courts of [[James I of England|James I]] and his son [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] contrasting with the sober styles in [[sadd colors|sadd colours]] favoured by [[Puritan]]s and exported to the early settlements of [[New England]] ([[#Puritan dress|see below]]).\n\nIn the early decades of the century, a trend among poets and artists to adopt a fashionable pose of [[melancholia]] is reflected in fashion, where the characteristic touches are dark colours, open collars, unbuttoned robes or [[doublet (clothing)|doublets]], and a generally disheveled appearance, accompanied in portraits by world-weary poses and sad expressions.\n\n==Fashions influenced by royal courts==\n\n===Fabric and patterns===\n[[File:Larkin cary detail.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Scrolling floral embroidery decorates this Englishwoman's dress, petticoat, and linen jacket, accented with blue-tinted reticella collar, cuffs, and headdress, c. 1614\u201318.]]\nFigured silks with elaborate [[pomegranate]] or [[artichoke]] patterns are still seen in this period, especially in Spain, but a lighter style of scrolling floral motifs, woven or [[embroidery|embroidered]], was popular, especially in England.\n\nThe great flowering of [[needlelace]] occurred in this period. Geometric [[reticella]] deriving from cutwork was elaborated into true needlelace or ''punto in aria'' (called in England \"point lace\"), which also reflected the popular scrolling floral designs.{{sfn|Berry|2004}}<ref>\nKliot, Jules and Kaethe: ''The Needle-Made Lace of Reticella''.</ref><ref>Montupet, Janine, and Ghislaine Schoeller: ''Lace: The Elegant Web''</ref>\n\nIn [[England]], embroidered linen silk jackets fastened with ribbon ties were fashionable for both men and women from c. 1600\u20131620, as was reticella tinted with yellow starch. Overgowns with split sleeves (often trimmed with horizontal rows of braid) were worn by both men and women.\n\nFrom the 1620s, surface ornament fell out of fashion in favour of solid-colour [[satin]]s, and functional [[ribbon]] bows or points became elaborate masses of rosettes and looped [[trim (sewing)|trim]].\n\n===Portraiture and fantasy===\n\nIn England from the 1630s, under the influence of literature and especially court [[masque]]s, [[Anthony van Dyck]] and his followers created a fashion for having one's portrait painted in exotic, historical or [[pastoral]] dress, or in simplified contemporary fashion with various scarves, cloaks, mantles, and jewels added to evoke a classic or romantic mood, and also to prevent the portrait appearing dated within a few years. These paintings are the progenitors of the fashion of the [[1650\u20131700 in fashion|later 17th century]] for having one's portrait painted in ''undress'', and do not necessarily reflect clothing as it was actually worn.<ref>See {{harvnb|Gordenker|2001|p={{Page needed|date=March 2012}}}} and {{harvnb|Winkel|2007|pp=70, 71}}</ref>\n\n==Women's fashions==\n[[File:Elizabeth Poulett by Robert Peake.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Elizabeth Poulett wears a low rounded neckline and a small ruff with paired with a winged collar.

Separate closed cartwheel ruffs were sometimes worn, with the standing collar, supported by a small wire frame or ''[[supportasse]]'' used for more casual wear and becoming more common later. Long sleeves were worn with deep cuffs to match the ruff. The cartwheel ruff disappeared in fashionable England by 1613.<ref>See [http://www.bergercollection.org/artwork_detail.php?i=35 Costume notes to portrait of Mary Radclyffe, Denver Museum of Art] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211194649/http://www.bergercollection.org/artwork_detail.php?i=35 |date=11 February 2006 }}</ref>\n\nBy the mid-1620s, styles were relaxing. Ruffs were discarded in favor of wired collars which were called ''rebatos'' in continental Europe and, later, wide, flat collars. By the 1630s and 1640s, collars were accompanied by [[kerchief]]s similar to the linen kerchiefs worn by middle-class women in the previous century; often the collar and kerchief were trimmed with matching lace.\n\nBodices were long-waisted at the beginning of the century, but waistlines rose steadily to the mid-1630s before beginning to drop again. In the second decade of the 17th century, short tabs developed attached to the bottom of the bodice covering the ''bum-roll'' which supported the skirts. These tabs grew longer during the 1620s and were worn with a [[stomacher]] which filled the gap between the two front edges of the bodice. By 1640, the long tabs had almost disappeared and a longer, smoother figure became fashionable: The waist returned to normal height at the back and sides with a low point at the front.\n\nThe long, tight sleeves of the early 17th century grew shorter, fuller, and looser. A common style of the 1620s and 1630s was the [[virago sleeve]], a full, slashed sleeve gathered into two puffs by a ribbon or other trim above the elbow.\n\nIn France and England, lightweight bright or pastel-coloured satins replaced dark, heavy fabrics. As in other periods, painters tended to avoid the difficulty of painting striped fabrics; it is clear from inventories that these were common.<ref>Marieke de Winkel in:Rudi Ekkart and Quentin Buvelot (eds), ''Dutch Portraits, The Age of Rembrandt and Frans Hals'', Mauritshuis/National Gallery/Waanders Publishers, Zwolle, p.73, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-85709-362-9}}</ref>\nShort strings of pearls were fashionable.\n\nUnfitted [[gown]]s (called ''nightgowns'' in England) with long hanging sleeves, short open sleeves, or no sleeves at all were worn over the bodice and skirt and tied with a ribbon sash at the waist. In England of the 1610s and 1620s, a loose nightgown was often worn over an embroidered jacket called a ''waistcoat'' and a contrasting embroidered [[petticoat]], without a [[farthingale]].<ref name=\"multiref1\">See Aileen Ribeiro, ''Fashion and Fiction: Dress in Art and Literature in Stuart England''</ref> Black gowns were worn for the most formal occasions; they fell out of fashion in England in the 1630s in favour of gowns to match the bodice and petticoat, but remained an important item of clothing on the Continent.\n\nAt least in the [[Netherlands]] the open-fronted overgown or ''vlieger'' was strictly reserved for married women. Before marriage the ''bouwen'', \"a dress with a fitted bodice and a skirt that was closed all round\" was worn instead; it was known in England as a \"Dutch\" or \"round gown\".<ref>Marieke de Winkel in:Rudi Ekkart and Quentin Buvelot (eds), ''Dutch Portraits, The Age of Rembrandt and Frans Hals'', Mauritshuis/National Gallery/Waanders Publishers, Zwolle, p.67, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-85709-362-9}}</ref>\n\n[[Skirt]]s might be open in front to reveal an underskirt or petticoat until about 1630, or closed all around; closed skirts were sometimes carried or worn looped up to reveal a petticoat.\n\n[[Corset]]s were shorter to suit the new bodices, and might have a very stiff ''busk'' in the center front extending to the depth of the [[stomacher]]. Skirts were held in the proper shape by a padded roll or ''French farthingale'' holding the skirts out in a rounded shape at the waist, falling in soft folds to the floor. The drum or wheel farthingale was worn at the English court until the death of [[Anne of Denmark]] in 1619.\n\n===Hairstyles and headdresses===\n\nTo about 1613, [[hair]] was worn feathered high over the forehead. Married women wore their hair in a linen [[coif]] or cap, often with lace trim. Tall hats like those worn by men were adopted for outdoor wear.\n\nIn a characteristic style of 1625\u20131650, hair was worn in loose waves to the shoulders on the sides, with the rest of the hair gathered or braided into a high [[Bun (hairstyle)|bun]] at the back of the head. A short [[Bangs (hair)|fringe or bangs]] might be worn with this style. Very fashionable married women abandoned the linen cap and wore their hair uncovered or with a hat.\n\n===Style gallery 1600\u20131620===\n<gallery>\nImage:Nicholas Hilliard 012.jpg|1 \u2013 1602\nImage:Anne of Denmark-1605.jpg|2 \u2013 1605\nImage:Isabella Rubens.jpg|3 \u2013 1609\nImage:Mary Radclyffe by William Larkin.jpg|4 \u2013 1610s\nImage:Anne of Denmark in mourning.jpg|5 \u2013 1612\nImage:Larkin cary.jpg|6 \u2013 1614\u201318\nImage:Frans Hals 045.jpg|7 \u2013 1618\u201320\nImage:Elizabeth style 1620.jpg|8 c. 1620\n</gallery>\n# [[:Image:Nicholas Hilliard 012.jpg|Hilliard's Unknown Woman]] of 1602 wears typical Puritan fashion of the early years of the century.

His hair falls in loose curls to his collar. C. 1625]]\n\n[[Linen]] [[shirt]]s had deep [[cuff]]s. Shirt sleeves became fuller throughout the period. To the 1620s, a collar wired to stick out horizontally, called a ''whisk'', was popular. Other styles included an unstarched ruff-like collar and, later, a rectangular ''falling band'' lying on the shoulders. Pointed Van Dyke beards, named after the painter [[Anthony van Dyck]], were fashionable, and men often grew a large, wide moustache, as well.\n[[doublet (clothing)|Doublets]] were pointed and fitted close to the body, with tight sleeves, to about 1615. Gradually waistlines rose and sleeves became fuller, and both body and upper sleeves might be slashed to show the shirt beneath. By 1640, doublets were full and unfitted, and might be open at the front below the high waist to show the shirt.\n\nSleeveless leather [[jerkin (garment)|jerkins]] were worn by soldiers and are seen in portraits, but otherwise the jerkin rapidly fell out of fashion for indoor wear.\n\n===Hose and breeches===\nG\n''Paned'' or ''pansied'' ''trunk hose'' or ''round hose'', padded hose with strips of fabric (''panes'') over a full inner layer or [[lining (sewing)|lining]], were worn early in the period, over ''cannions'', fitted hose that\nended above the knee. Trunk hose were longer than in the [[1550\u20131600 in fashion|previous period]], and were pear-shaped, with less fullness at the waist and more at mid-thigh.\n\n''Slops'' or ''galligaskins'', loose hose reaching just below the knee, replaced all other styles of hose by the 1620s, and were now generally called [[breeches]]. Breeches might be fastened up the outer leg with buttons or buckles over a full lining.\n\nFrom 1600 to c. 1630, hose or breeches were fastened to doublets by means of ties or ''points'', short laces or ribbons pulled through matching sets of worked [[eyelet]]s. Points were tied in bows at the waist and became more elaborate until they disappeared with the very short waisted doublets of the late 1630s. Decorated metal tips on points were called [[aiguillette]]s or aiglets, and those of the wealthy were made of precious metals set with [[pearl]]s and other [[gemstone]]s.<ref name=\"Jewel\">Scarisbrick, Diana, ''Tudor and Jacobean Jewellery'', pp. 99\u2013100</ref>\n\n[[Spanish breeches]], rather stiff ungathered breeches, were also popular throughout the era.\n\n===Outerwear===\n\n[[Gown]]s were worn early in the period, but fell out of fashion in the 1620s.\n\nShort [[cloak]]s or [[cape]]s, usually hip-length, often with [[sleeve]]s, were worn by fashionable men, usually slung artistically over the left shoulder, even indoors; a fashion of the 1630s matched the cape fabric to the breeches and its lining to the doublet. Long cloaks were worn for inclement weather.\n\n===Hairstyles and Headgear===\n\nEarly in the period, hair was worn collar-length and brushed back from the forehead; very fashionable men wore a single long strand of hair called a [[lovelock (hairstyle)|lovelock]] over one shoulder. Hairstyles grew longer through the period, and long curls were fashionable by the late 1630s and 1640s, pointing toward the ascendance of the [[Wig (hair)|wig]] in the [[1650\u20131700 in fashion|1660s]].\n\nPointed [[beard]]s and wide [[mustache]]s were fashionable.\n\nTo about 1620, the fashionable [[hat]] was the [[capotain]], with a tall conical crown rounded at the top and a narrow brim. By the 1630s, the crown was shorter and the brim was wider, often worn ''cocked'' or pinned up on one side and decorated with a mass of [[ostrich]] [[feather|plumes]].\n\nClose-fitting caps called [[coif]]s or ''biggins'' were worn only by young children and old men under their hats or alone indoors.\n\n===Style gallery 1600s\u20131620s===\n<gallery>\nImage:JamesIEngland.jpg|1 \u2013 1603-10\nImage:Henry prince of wales.jpg|2 \u2013 1606\u201309\nImage:Peter saltonstall 1610.jpg |3 \u2013 c. 1610\nImage:RSackville.jpg|4 \u2013 1613\nFile:Nathan Field.JPG|5 - 1615\nFile:Dani\u00ebl Mijtens - Portrait of James Hamilton, Earl of Arran, Later 3rd Marquis and 1st Duke of Hamilton, Aged 17 - Google Art Project.jpg|6 \u2013 1623\nImage:Carlos de Austria, infante de Espa\u00f1a.jpg|7 \u2013 1628\nImage:Charles 1 Mijtens.jpg|8 \u2013 1629\nImage:Gustav II Adolf portr\u00e4tterad av Jakob Elbfas ca 1630.jpg|9 - 1630\n</gallery>\n\n# [[:Image:JamesIEngland.jpg|James VI and I]], 1603\u20131610, wears a satin doublet, wired whisk, short cape, and hose over cannions.

Gowns with low necklines were filled in with high-necked smocks and wide collars. Married women covered their hair with a linen cap, over which they might wear a tall black hat. Men and women avoided bright colours, shiny fabrics and over-ornamentation.\n\nContrary to popular belief, most Puritans and [[Calvinist]]s did not wear black for everyday, especially in [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[colonial America]]. Black dye was expensive, faded quickly and black clothing was reserved for the most formal occasions (including having one's portrait painted), for elders in a community and for those of higher rank. Richer puritans, like their Dutch [[Calvinist]] contemporaries, probably did wear it often but in silk, often patterned. Typical colours for most were [[brown]], [[murrey]] ([[mulberry]], a brownish-maroon), dull greens and tawny colours. Wool and linen were preferred over silks and satins, though Puritan women of rank wore modest amounts of lace and embroidery as appropriate to their station, believing that the various ranks of society were divinely ordained and should be reflected even in the most modest dress. [[William Perkins (Puritan)|William Perkins]] wrote \"...that apparel is necessary for Scholar, the Tradesman, the Countryman, the Gentleman; which serveth not only to defend their bodies from cold, but which belongs also to the place, degree, calling, and condition of them all\" (''Cases of Conscience'', 1616).<ref>See [http://www.covenanter.org/Attire/perkinsapparel.htm ''Cases of Conscience'', 1616] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716153809/http://www.covenanter.org/Attire/perkinsapparel.htm |date=16 July 2006 }}</ref>\n\nSome Puritans rejected the long, curled hair as effeminate and favoured a shorter fashion which led to the nickname [[Roundhead]]s for adherents of the English Parliamentary party but the taste for lavish or simple dress cut across both parties in the [[English Civil War]].<ref name=\"Ribeiro\">Ribeiro, Aileen: ''Dress and Morality'', Berg Publishers 2003, {{ISBN|1-85973-782-X}}, pp. 12\u201316</ref>\n\n==Working class clothing==\n<gallery>\nImage:Pieter Bruegel d.

Waistlines rose through the period for both men and women. Other notable fashions included full, slashed [[sleeve]]s and tall or broad [[hat]]s with brims. For men, [[hose (clothing)|hose]] disappeared in favour of [[breeches]].\n\n[[File:Rubens isabella brant c1610.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The artist [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] with his first wife c. 1610. Her long, rounded stomacher and jacket-like bodice are characteristic [[Netherlands|Dutch]] fashions]]\nThe silhouette, which was essentially close to the body with tight [[sleeve]]s and a low, pointed waist to around 1615, gradually softened and broadened. Sleeves became very full, and in the 1620s and 1630s were often paned or slashed to show the voluminous sleeves of the [[shirt]] or [[chemise]] beneath.\n\n[[Spain|Spanish]] fashions remained very conservative. The ruff lingered longest in Spain and the [[Netherlands]], but disappeared first for men and later for women in [[France]] and [[England]].\n\nThe social tensions leading to the [[English Civil War]] were reflected in English fashion, with the elaborate French styles popular at the courts of [[James I of England|James I]] and his son [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] contrasting with the sober styles in [[sadd colors|sadd colours]] favoured by [[Puritan]]s and exported to the early settlements of [[New England]] ([[#Puritan dress|see below]]).\n\nIn the early decades of the century, a trend among poets and artists to adopt a fashionable pose of [[melancholia]] is reflected in fashion, where the characteristic touches are dark colours, open collars, unbuttoned robes or [[doublet (clothing)|doublets]], and a generally disheveled appearance, accompanied in portraits by world-weary poses and sad expressions.\n\n==Fashions influenced by royal courts==\n\n===Fabric and patterns===\n[[File:Larkin cary detail.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Scrolling floral embroidery decorates this Englishwoman's dress, petticoat, and linen jacket, accented with blue-tinted reticella collar, cuffs, and headdress, c. 1614\u201318.]]\nFigured silks with elaborate [[pomegranate]] or [[artichoke]] patterns are still seen in this period, especially in Spain, but a lighter style of scrolling floral motifs, woven or [[embroidery|embroidered]], was popular, especially in England.\n\nThe great flowering of [[needlelace]] occurred in this period. Geometric [[reticella]] deriving from cutwork was elaborated into true needlelace or ''punto in aria'' (called in England \"point lace\"), which also reflected the popular scrolling floral designs.{{sfn|Berry|2004}}<ref>\nKliot, Jules and Kaethe: ''The Needle-Made Lace of Reticella''.</ref><ref>Montupet, Janine, and Ghislaine Schoeller: ''Lace: The Elegant Web''</ref>\n\nIn [[England]], embroidered linen silk jackets fastened with ribbon ties were fashionable for both men and women from c. 1600\u20131620, as was reticella tinted with yellow starch. Overgowns with split sleeves (often trimmed with horizontal rows of braid) were worn by both men and women.\n\nFrom the 1620s, surface ornament fell out of fashion in favour of solid-colour [[satin]]s, and functional [[ribbon]] bows or points became elaborate masses of rosettes and looped [[trim (sewing)|trim]].\n\n===Portraiture and fantasy===\n\nIn England from the 1630s, under the influence of literature and especially court [[masque]]s, [[Anthony van Dyck]] and his followers created a fashion for having one's portrait painted in exotic, historical or [[pastoral]] dress, or in simplified contemporary fashion with various scarves, cloaks, mantles, and jewels added to evoke a classic or romantic mood, and also to prevent the portrait appearing dated within a few years. These paintings are the progenitors of the fashion of the [[1650\u20131700 in fashion|later 17th century]] for having one's portrait painted in ''undress'', and do not necessarily reflect clothing as it was actually worn.<ref>See {{harvnb|Gordenker|2001|p={{Page needed|date=March 2012}}}} and {{harvnb|Winkel|2007|pp=70, 71}}</ref>\n\n==Women's fashions==\n[[File:Elizabeth Poulett by Robert Peake.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Elizabeth Poulett wears a low rounded neckline and a small ruff with paired with a winged collar.

Separate closed cartwheel ruffs were sometimes worn, with the standing collar, supported by a small wire frame or ''[[supportasse]]'' used for more casual wear and becoming more common later. Long sleeves were worn with deep cuffs to match the ruff. The cartwheel ruff disappeared in fashionable England by 1613.<ref>See [http://www.bergercollection.org/artwork_detail.php?i=35 Costume notes to portrait of Mary Radclyffe, Denver Museum of Art] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211194649/http://www.bergercollection.org/artwork_detail.php?i=35 |date=11 February 2006 }}</ref>\n\nBy the mid-1620s, styles were relaxing. Ruffs were discarded in favor of wired collars which were called ''rebatos'' in continental Europe and, later, wide, flat collars. By the 1630s and 1640s, collars were accompanied by [[kerchief]]s similar to the linen kerchiefs worn by middle-class women in the previous century; often the collar and kerchief were trimmed with matching lace.\n\nBodices were long-waisted at the beginning of the century, but waistlines rose steadily to the mid-1630s before beginning to drop again. In the second decade of the 17th century, short tabs developed attached to the bottom of the bodice covering the ''bum-roll'' which supported the skirts. These tabs grew longer during the 1620s and were worn with a [[stomacher]] which filled the gap between the two front edges of the bodice. By 1640, the long tabs had almost disappeared and a longer, smoother figure became fashionable: The waist returned to normal height at the back and sides with a low point at the front.\n\nThe long, tight sleeves of the early 17th century grew shorter, fuller, and looser. A common style of the 1620s and 1630s was the [[virago sleeve]], a full, slashed sleeve gathered into two puffs by a ribbon or other trim above the elbow.\n\nIn France and England, lightweight bright or pastel-coloured satins replaced dark, heavy fabrics. As in other periods, painters tended to avoid the difficulty of painting striped fabrics; it is clear from inventories that these were common.<ref>Marieke de Winkel in:Rudi Ekkart and Quentin Buvelot (eds), ''Dutch Portraits, The Age of Rembrandt and Frans Hals'', Mauritshuis/National Gallery/Waanders Publishers, Zwolle, p.73, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-85709-362-9}}</ref>\nShort strings of pearls were fashionable.\n\nUnfitted [[gown]]s (called ''nightgowns'' in England) with long hanging sleeves, short open sleeves, or no sleeves at all were worn over the bodice and skirt and tied with a ribbon sash at the waist. In England of the 1610s and 1620s, a loose nightgown was often worn over an embroidered jacket called a ''waistcoat'' and a contrasting embroidered [[petticoat]], without a [[farthingale]].<ref name=\"multiref1\">See Aileen Ribeiro, ''Fashion and Fiction: Dress in Art and Literature in Stuart England''</ref> Black gowns were worn for the most formal occasions; they fell out of fashion in England in the 1630s in favour of gowns to match the bodice and petticoat, but remained an important item of clothing on the Continent.\n\nAt least in the [[Netherlands]] the open-fronted overgown or ''vlieger'' was strictly reserved for married women. Before marriage the ''bouwen'', \"a dress with a fitted bodice and a skirt that was closed all round\" was worn instead; it was known in England as a \"Dutch\" or \"round gown\".<ref>Marieke de Winkel in:Rudi Ekkart and Quentin Buvelot (eds), ''Dutch Portraits, The Age of Rembrandt and Frans Hals'', Mauritshuis/National Gallery/Waanders Publishers, Zwolle, p.67, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-85709-362-9}}</ref>\n\n[[Skirt]]s might be open in front to reveal an underskirt or petticoat until about 1630, or closed all around; closed skirts were sometimes carried or worn looped up to reveal a petticoat.\n\n[[Corset]]s were shorter to suit the new bodices, and might have a very stiff ''busk'' in the center front extending to the depth of the [[stomacher]]. Skirts were held in the proper shape by a padded roll or ''French farthingale'' holding the skirts out in a rounded shape at the waist, falling in soft folds to the floor. The drum or wheel farthingale was worn at the English court until the death of [[Anne of Denmark]] in 1619.\n\n===Hairstyles and headdresses===\n\nTo about 1613, [[hair]] was worn feathered high over the forehead. Married women wore their hair in a linen [[coif]] or cap, often with lace trim. Tall hats like those worn by men were adopted for outdoor wear.\n\nIn a characteristic style of 1625\u20131650, hair was worn in loose waves to the shoulders on the sides, with the rest of the hair gathered or braided into a high [[Bun (hairstyle)|bun]] at the back of the head. A short [[Bangs (hair)|fringe or bangs]] might be worn with this style. Very fashionable married women abandoned the linen cap and wore their hair uncovered or with a hat.\n\n===Style gallery 1600\u20131620===\n<gallery>\nImage:Nicholas Hilliard 012.jpg|1 \u2013 1602\nImage:Anne of Denmark-1605.jpg|2 \u2013 1605\nImage:Isabella Rubens.jpg|3 \u2013 1609\nImage:Mary Radclyffe by William Larkin.jpg|4 \u2013 1610s\nImage:Anne of Denmark in mourning.jpg|5 \u2013 1612\nImage:Larkin cary.jpg|6 \u2013 1614\u201318\nImage:Frans Hals 045.jpg|7 \u2013 1618\u201320\nImage:Elizabeth style 1620.jpg|8 c. 1620\n</gallery>\n# [[:Image:Nicholas Hilliard 012.jpg|Hilliard's Unknown Woman]] of 1602 wears typical Puritan fashion of the early years of the century.

His hair falls in loose curls to his collar. C. 1625]]\n\n[[Linen]] [[shirt]]s had deep [[cuff]]s. Shirt sleeves became fuller throughout the period. To the 1620s, a collar wired to stick out horizontally, called a ''whisk'', was popular. Other styles included an unstarched ruff-like collar and, later, a rectangular ''falling band'' lying on the shoulders. Pointed Van Dyke beards, named after the painter [[Anthony van Dyck]], were fashionable, and men often grew a large, wide moustache, as well.\n[[doublet (clothing)|Doublets]] were pointed and fitted close to the body, with tight sleeves, to about 1615. Gradually waistlines rose and sleeves became fuller, and both body and upper sleeves might be slashed to show the shirt beneath. By 1640, doublets were full and unfitted, and might be open at the front below the high waist to show the shirt.\n\nSleeveless leather [[jerkin (garment)|jerkins]] were worn by soldiers and are seen in portraits, but otherwise the jerkin rapidly fell out of fashion for indoor wear.\n\n===Hose and breeches===\nG\n''Paned'' or ''pansied'' ''trunk hose'' or ''round hose'', padded hose with strips of fabric (''panes'') over a full inner layer or [[lining (sewing)|lining]], were worn early in the period, over ''cannions'', fitted hose that\nended above the knee. Trunk hose were longer than in the [[1550\u20131600 in fashion|previous period]], and were pear-shaped, with less fullness at the waist and more at mid-thigh.\n\n''Slops'' or ''galligaskins'', loose hose reaching just below the knee, replaced all other styles of hose by the 1620s, and were now generally called [[breeches]]. Breeches might be fastened up the outer leg with buttons or buckles over a full lining.\n\nFrom 1600 to c. 1630, hose or breeches were fastened to doublets by means of ties or ''points'', short laces or ribbons pulled through matching sets of worked [[eyelet]]s. Points were tied in bows at the waist and became more elaborate until they disappeared with the very short waisted doublets of the late 1630s. Decorated metal tips on points were called [[aiguillette]]s or aiglets, and those of the wealthy were made of precious metals set with [[pearl]]s and other [[gemstone]]s.<ref name=\"Jewel\">Scarisbrick, Diana, ''Tudor and Jacobean Jewellery'', pp. 99\u2013100</ref>\n\n[[Spanish breeches]], rather stiff ungathered breeches, were also popular throughout the era.\n\n===Outerwear===\n\n[[Gown]]s were worn early in the period, but fell out of fashion in the 1620s.\n\nShort [[cloak]]s or [[cape]]s, usually hip-length, often with [[sleeve]]s, were worn by fashionable men, usually slung artistically over the left shoulder, even indoors; a fashion of the 1630s matched the cape fabric to the breeches and its lining to the doublet. Long cloaks were worn for inclement weather.\n\n===Hairstyles and Headgear===\n\nEarly in the period, hair was worn collar-length and brushed back from the forehead; very fashionable men wore a single long strand of hair called a [[lovelock (hairstyle)|lovelock]] over one shoulder. Hairstyles grew longer through the period, and long curls were fashionable by the late 1630s and 1640s, pointing toward the ascendance of the [[Wig (hair)|wig]] in the [[1650\u20131700 in fashion|1660s]].\n\nPointed [[beard]]s and wide [[mustache]]s were fashionable.\n\nTo about 1620, the fashionable [[hat]] was the [[capotain]], with a tall conical crown rounded at the top and a narrow brim. By the 1630s, the crown was shorter and the brim was wider, often worn ''cocked'' or pinned up on one side and decorated with a mass of [[ostrich]] [[feather|plumes]].\n\nClose-fitting caps called [[coif]]s or ''biggins'' were worn only by young children and old men under their hats or alone indoors.\n\n===Style gallery 1600s\u20131620s===\n<gallery>\nImage:JamesIEngland.jpg|1 \u2013 1603-10\nImage:Henry prince of wales.jpg|2 \u2013 1606\u201309\nImage:Peter saltonstall 1610.jpg |3 \u2013 c. 1610\nImage:RSackville.jpg|4 \u2013 1613\nFile:Nathan Field.JPG|5 - 1615\nFile:Dani\u00ebl Mijtens - Portrait of James Hamilton, Earl of Arran, Later 3rd Marquis and 1st Duke of Hamilton, Aged 17 - Google Art Project.jpg|6 \u2013 1623\nImage:Carlos de Austria, infante de Espa\u00f1a.jpg|7 \u2013 1628\nImage:Charles 1 Mijtens.jpg|8 \u2013 1629\nImage:Gustav II Adolf portr\u00e4tterad av Jakob Elbfas ca 1630.jpg|9 - 1630\n</gallery>\n\n# [[:Image:JamesIEngland.jpg|James VI and I]], 1603\u20131610, wears a satin doublet, wired whisk, short cape, and hose over cannions.

Gowns with low necklines were filled in with high-necked smocks and wide collars. Married women covered their hair with a linen cap, over which they might wear a tall black hat. Men and women avoided bright colours, shiny fabrics and over-ornamentation.\n\nContrary to popular belief, most Puritans and [[Calvinist]]s did not wear black for everyday, especially in [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[colonial America]]. Black dye was expensive, faded quickly and black clothing was reserved for the most formal occasions (including having one's portrait painted), for elders in a community and for those of higher rank. Richer puritans, like their Dutch [[Calvinist]] contemporaries, probably did wear it often but in silk, often patterned. Typical colours for most were [[brown]], [[murrey]] ([[mulberry]], a brownish-maroon), dull greens and tawny colours. Wool and linen were preferred over silks and satins, though Puritan women of rank wore modest amounts of lace and embroidery as appropriate to their station, believing that the various ranks of society were divinely ordained and should be reflected even in the most modest dress. [[William Perkins (Puritan)|William Perkins]] wrote \"...that apparel is necessary for Scholar, the Tradesman, the Countryman, the Gentleman; which serveth not only to defend their bodies from cold, but which belongs also to the place, degree, calling, and condition of them all\" (''Cases of Conscience'', 1616).<ref>See [http://www.covenanter.org/Attire/perkinsapparel.htm ''Cases of Conscience'', 1616] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716153809/http://www.covenanter.org/Attire/perkinsapparel.htm |date=16 July 2006 }}</ref>\n\nSome Puritans rejected the long, curled hair as effeminate and favoured a shorter fashion which led to the nickname [[Roundhead]]s for adherents of the English Parliamentary party but the taste for lavish or simple dress cut across both parties in the [[English Civil War]].<ref name=\"Ribeiro\">Ribeiro, Aileen: ''Dress and Morality'', Berg Publishers 2003, {{ISBN|1-85973-782-X}}, pp. 12\u201316</ref>\n\n==Working class clothing==\n<gallery>\nImage:Pieter Bruegel d.

The style of this era is known as Baroque. Following the end of the [[Thirty Years' War]] and the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of [[England's]] [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], military influences in men's clothing were replaced by a brief period of decorative exuberance which then sobered into the [[coat (clothing)|coat]], [[waistcoat]] and [[breeches]] costume that would reign for the next century and a half. In the normal cycle of fashion, the broad, high-waisted silhouette of the [[1600\u20131650 in fashion|previous period]] was replaced by a long, lean line with a low waist for both men and women. This period also marked the rise of the [[Wig (hair)|periwig]] as an essential item of men's fashion.\n\n== Women's fashion ==\n[[File:Portrait of Suzanna Doublet-Huygens by Caspar Netscher.jpg|thumb|right|Susanna Huygens wore a long, tight white satin bodice with paned sleeves lined in pink and a matching petticoat.

The body was tightly [[corset]]ed, with a low, broad neckline and dropped shoulder. In later decades, the [[overskirt]] was drawn back and pinned up to display the [[petticoat]], which was heavily decorated.\n\nSpanish court fashion remained out of step with the fashions that arose in France and England, and prosperous [[Holland]] also retained its own modest fashions, especially in headdress and hairstyles, as it had retained the [[ruff (clothing)|ruff]] in the previous period.\n\n=== Romantic negligence ===\nA daring new fashion arose for having one's portrait painted in ''undress'', wearing a loosely fastened [[gown]] called a ''nightgown'' over a voluminous [[chemise]], with tousled curls. The style is epitomized by the portraits of [[Peter Lely]], which derive from the romanticized style originated by [[Anthony van Dyck]] in the 1630s. The clothing in these portraits is not representative of what was worn on the street or at court.<ref>Gordenker, ''Van Dyck and the Representation of Dress in Seventeenth-Century Portraiture''</ref><ref>de Marly, \"Undress in the \u0152uvre of Lely\"</ref>\n\n=== Mantua ===\nThe ''[[mantua (clothing)|mantua]]'' or ''manteau'' was a new fashion that arose in the 1680s. Instead of a bodice and skirt cut separately, the mantua hung from the shoulders to the floor (in the manner of dresses of earlier periods) started off as the female version of the men's [[Banyan (clothing)|Banyan]], worn for 'undress' wear. Gradually it developed into a draped and pleated dress and eventually evolved into a dress worn looped and draped up over a contrasting petticoat and a stomacher. The mantua-and-stomacher resulted in a high, square neckline in contrast to the broad, off-the-shoulder neckline previously in fashion. The new look was both more modest and covered-up than previous fashions and decidedly fussy, with bows, frills, ribbons, and other trim, but the short string of pearls and pearl earrings or ''eardrops'' worn since the 1630s remained popular.\n\nThe mantua, made from a single length of fabric pleated to fit with a long train, was ideal for showing the designs of the new elaborately patterned silks that replaced the solid-colored satins popular in mid-century.<ref>Ribeiro, Aileen, on the origins of the mantua in the late 17th century, in ''Dress in Eighteenth Century Europe 1715\u20131789''; Ashelford, Jane, ''The Art of Dress''</ref>\n\n=== Hunting and riding dress ===\n\nIn a June 1666 diary entry, [[Samuel Pepys]] describes the Maids of Honour in their [[riding habit]]s of mannish coats, doublets, hats, and periwigs, \"so that, only for a long petticoat dragging under their men's coats, nobody could take them for women in any point whatever\". For riding [[Sidesaddle|side-saddle]], the costume had a long, trailing petticoat or skirt. This would be looped up or replaced by an ankle-length skirt for shooting or walking.\n\n=== Hairstyles and headgear ===\nEarly in the period, hair was worn in a bun at the back of the head with a cluster of curls framing the face. The curls grew more elaborate through the 1650s, then longer, until curls were hanging gracefully on the shoulder. In the 1680s hair was parted in the center with height over the temples, and by the 1690s hair was unparted, with rows of curls stacked\nhigh over the forehead.\n\nThis hairstyle was often topped with a ''[[fontange]]'', a frilly cap of lace wired to stand in vertical tiers with streamers to either side, named for [[Ang\u00e9lique de Fontanges|a mistress of the French King]]. This was popular from the 1690s to the first few years of the 18th century.\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Style gallery 1650s ===\n<gallery>\nFile:Charlotte von Hessen-Kassel um 1650.jpg|1 \u2013 1650\nFile:Honthorst Roodere detail.jpg|2 \u2013 1652\nFile:Maria Stuart als weduwe van Willem II Rijksmuseum SK-A-142.jpeg|3 \u2013 1652\nFile:Diego Vel\u00e1zquez 030.jpg|4 \u2013 1653\nFile:Gerard ter Borch d.

His blue waistcoat has wide buttonholes, and he wears his own hair for outdoor activity. Self-portrait, 1699.]]\nWith the end of the [[Thirty Years' War]], the fashions of the 1650s and early 1660s imitated the new peaceful and more relaxed feeling in Europe. The military [[boot]]s gave way to shoes, and a mania for baggy breeches, short coats, and hundreds of yards of ribbon set the style. The breeches (see [[Petticoat breeches]]) became so baggy that [[Samuel Pepys]] wrote in his diary: \"And among other things, met with Mr. Townsend, who told of his mistake the other day to put both his legs through one of his Knees of his breeches, and so went all day.\" (April 1661) The wide breeches that made such an error possible were soon being gathered at the knee: Pepys noted, 19 April 1663 \"this day put on my close-kneed coloured suit, which, with new stockings of the colour, with belt, and new gilt-handled sword, is very handsome.\" This era was also one of great variation and transition.\n\nIn 1666, [[Charles II of England, Scotland and Ireland]], following the earlier example of [[Louis XIV of France]], decreed that at court, men were to wear a long coat, a [[waistcoat|vest or waistcoat]] (originally called a ''petticoat'', a term which later became applied solely to women's dress), a [[necktie|cravat]], a [[wig (hair)|periwig or wig]], and [[breeches]] gathered at the knee, as well as a [[hat]] for outdoor wear. By 1680, this more sober uniform-like outfit of coat, waistcoat, and breeches became the norm for formal dress.\n\n=== Coat and waistcoat ===\nThe unfitted looser fit of the [[1600\u20131650 in fashion|1640s]] continued into the 1650s. In the 1650s, [[sleeve]]s ranged from above to below the elbow. The sleeves could be slashed, unslashed, or dividing into two parts and buttoned together. The length of the coat reached the waist but by the late 1650s and early 1660s, the coat became very short, only reaching the bottom of the rib cage, much like a bolero jacket. During the 1660s, the sleeves varied a lot from elbow length to no sleeves at all. The coat could be worn opened or buttoned in the front. One common factor were many yards of ribbon loops arranged on the shoulders and the lower parts of the sleeves.\n\nA longer and rather baggy coat (still with sleeves rarely going below the elbow) made an appearance in the early 1660s and as the decade progressed became the most popular coat. By the late 1660s, an upturned cuff became popular although the sleeves had still remained above the elbows. By the 1670s, a vest or waistcoat was worn under the coat. It was usually made of contrasting, often luxurious, fabric, and might have a plain back since that was not seen under the coat. It was a long garment which by the 1680s reached just above the knees. With the end of the 1670s the sleeves became longer and the coat more fitted. The 1680s saw larger upturned cuffs and the waist of the coat became much wider. The coat could have lapels or none. This coat is known as the ''[[justacorps]]''. The pockets on both sides of the coats were arranged horizontally or vertically (especially the mid to late 1680s) until the 1690s when the pockets were usually always arranged horizontally. The waistcoat could be sleeveless or have long sleeves. Typically, a long-sleeved waistcoat was worn in winter for added warmth. By the mid-1680s, ribbons were reduced to one side of the shoulder until by the 1690s, they were gone.\n\n=== Shirt, collar and cravat ===\nThe ruffled long-sleeved white [[shirt]] remained the only constant throughout the period, although less of it was seen with the advent of the waistcoat.\n\nDuring the early to mid-1650s, a rather small falling [[collar (clothing)|collar]] was in fashion. This increased in size and encompassed much of the shoulders by 1660. [[Cravat]]s and [[Jabot (neckwear)|jabots]] around the neck started to be worn during the early 1660s (initially with the falling collar). By the mid-1660s, the collar had disappeared with just the cravat remaining, sometimes tied with a small bow of ribbon. Red was the most common color for the bow, although pink, blue, and other colors were also used. By the 1670s, the bow of ribbons had increased in size and in the 1680s, the bow of ribbons became very large and intricate with many loops of ribbon. By the mid-1690s, the very large bow of ribbons was discarded. Also, a new style of cravat made its appearance in the 1690s, the ''Steinkerk'' (named after the [[Steenkerque|Battle of Steenkerque]] in 1692). Before, the cravat was always worn flowing down the chest; the Steinkerk cravat looped through a buttonhole of the coat.\n\n=== Breeches and stockings ===\nThe previous decade saw [[Spanish breeches]] as the most popular. These were stiff breeches which fell above or just below the knee and were rather moderately fitted. By the mid-1650s, in Western Europe, much looser, uncollected breeches, called [[petticoat breeches]] became the most popular. As the 1650s progressed, they became larger and looser, very much giving the impression of a lady's [[petticoat]]. They were usually decorated with many yards of ribbon around the waist and around the ungathered knee on the outside of the leg. Alongside the petticoat breeches, a collected but still loose fitted breeches called [[rhinegraves]], were also worn. By the early 1660s, their popularity surpassed petticoat breeches. They were usually worn with an overskirt over them. The overskirt was heavily decorated with ribbon on the waist and the bottom of the skirt. Its length was usually just above the knee, but could also extend past the knee so that the rhinegraves underneath could not be seen and only the bottom of the stocking-tops was visible.\n\nWith the rising popularity of the longer coat and waistcoat, the large collected rhinegraves and overskirt were abandoned in favor of more close fitting breeches. By the late 1670s, close fitted breeches were worn with the stockings worn over them and on or above the knee, often being gartered with a garter below the knee. With the long waistcoat and stockings worn over the knee, very little of the breeches could be seen. A possible reason that the stockings were worn over the knee, was to give the impression of longer legs since the waist coat fell very low, just above the knee. The breeches tended to be of the same material as the coat. The stockings varied in color.\n\n=== Footwear and accessories ===\nShoes again became the most popular footwear during the 1650s, although boots remained in use for riding and outdoor pursuits. ''[[Boothose]]'', originally of linen with lace cuffs and worn over the fine silk stockings to protect them from wear, remained in fashion even when boots lost their popularity. Boothose lasted well in the mid-1660s, attached right under where the rhinegraves were gathered below the knee, or fashionably slouched and unfastened. Shoes from the 1650s through the 1670s tended to be square toed and slightly long in appearance. Usually the shoes were tied with ribbon and decorated with bows. By the 1680s, the shoe became a bit more fitted; the heel increased in height (with red heels being very popular, especially for attendance at Court), and only a small ribbon if any remained.\n\nThe [[baldric]] (a sword hanger worn across one shoulder) was worn until the mid-1680s, when it was replaced by the sword belt (a sword hanger worn across the hips).\n\n=== Hairstyles ===\n[[File:Ex-voto a sainte-genevieve -Detail-Largilliere.jpg|right|thumb|The elaborate wig of the 1690s]]\nThroughout the period, men wore their hair long with curls well past the shoulders. The bangs (fringe) were usually combed forward and allowed to flow over the forehead a bit. Although men had worn wigs for years to cover up thinning hair or baldness, the popularity of the wig or periwig as standard wardrobe is usually credited to King Louis XIV of France. Louis started to go bald at a relatively young age and had to cover up his baldness with wigs. His early wigs very much imitated what were the hairstyles of the day, but they gave a thicker and fuller appearance than natural hair. Due to the success of the wigs, other men started to wear wigs as well. By 1680, a part in the middle of the wig became the norm. The hair on either side of the part continued to grow in the 1680s until by the 1690s two very high pronounced points developed on the forehead. As well, during the 1680s, the wig was divided into three parts: the front including the center part and the long curls which fell well past the shoulders, the back of the head which was combed rather close to the head, and a mass of curls which flowed down the shoulders and back. The curls of the wig throughout the 1660s until 1700 were rather loose. Tighter curls would not make their appearance until after 1700. Every natural color of wig was possible. Louis XIV tended to favor a brown wig. His son, [[Louis, the Grand Dauphin|Monseigneur]] was well known for wearing blond wigs. Facial hair declined in popularity during this period although thin moustaches remained popular up until the 1680s.\n\n=== Hats and headgear ===\n[[Hat]]s vary greatly during this period. Hats with very tall crowns, derived from the earlier [[capotain]] but with flat crowns, were popular until the end of the 1650s. The brims varied as well. Hats were decorated with feathers. By the 1660s, a very small hat with a very low crown, little brim, and large amount of feathers was popular among the French courtiers. Later in the 1660s, very large brims and moderate crowns became popular. Sometimes one side of the brim would be turned up. These continued fashionable well into the 1680s. From the 1680s until 1700, various styles and combinations of upturned brims were in fashion, from one brim upturned to three brims upturned (the ''tricorne''). Even the angle at which the brims were situated on the head varied. Sometimes with a tricorne, the point would meet over the forehead or it would be set at a 45 degree angle from the forehead.\n\n=== Style gallery 1650s ===\n<gallery>\nFile:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 097.jpg|1 \u2013 1654\nFile:Dr\u00e4kt fr\u00e5n 1654 - Livrustkammaren - 30283.tif|2 \u2013 1654\nFile:Emanuel De Geer, 1624-1692 (Bartholomeus van der Helst) - Nationalmuseum - 77290.tif|3 \u2013 1656 \nFile:Dutch1658.JPG|4 \u2013 1658\n</gallery>\n# [[:File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 097.jpg|Coat]] of 1654 has many tiny buttons on the front and sleeves, which are left unfastened below the chest and upper arm.

The style of this era is known as Baroque. Following the end of the [[Thirty Years' War]] and the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of [[England's]] [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], military influences in men's clothing were replaced by a brief period of decorative exuberance which then sobered into the [[coat (clothing)|coat]], [[waistcoat]] and [[breeches]] costume that would reign for the next century and a half. In the normal cycle of fashion, the broad, high-waisted silhouette of the [[1600\u20131650 in fashion|previous period]] was replaced by a long, lean line with a low waist for both men and women. This period also marked the rise of the [[Wig (hair)|periwig]] as an essential item of men's fashion.\n\n== Women's fashion ==\n[[File:Portrait of Suzanna Doublet-Huygens by Caspar Netscher.jpg|thumb|right|Susanna Huygens wore a long, tight white satin bodice with paned sleeves lined in pink and a matching petticoat. Her hair is worn in a mass of tight curls, and she wears pearl eardrops and a pearl necklace. 1667\u201369.]]\n[[File:Barbara Palmer (n\u00e9e Villiers), Duchess of Cleveland by John Michael Wright.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of [[Barbara Palmer, 1st Duchess of Cleveland|Barbara Viliers]], mistress of King Charles II, painted by [[John Michael Wright]] c. 1670 in the romantic style.]]\n\n=== Overview ===\nThe wide, high-waisted look of the [[1600\u20131650 in fashion|previous period]] was gradually superseded by a long vertical line, with horizontal emphasis at the shoulder. Full, loose [[sleeve]]s ended just below the elbow at mid century and became longer and tighter in keeping with the new trend. The body was tightly [[corset]]ed, with a low, broad neckline and dropped shoulder. In later decades, the [[overskirt]] was drawn back and pinned up to display the [[petticoat]], which was heavily decorated.\n\nSpanish court fashion remained out of step with the fashions that arose in France and England, and prosperous [[Holland]] also retained its own modest fashions, especially in headdress and hairstyles, as it had retained the [[ruff (clothing)|ruff]] in the previous period.\n\n=== Romantic negligence ===\nA daring new fashion arose for having one's portrait painted in ''undress'', wearing a loosely fastened [[gown]] called a ''nightgown'' over a voluminous [[chemise]], with tousled curls. The style is epitomized by the portraits of [[Peter Lely]], which derive from the romanticized style originated by [[Anthony van Dyck]] in the 1630s. The clothing in these portraits is not representative of what was worn on the street or at court.<ref>Gordenker, ''Van Dyck and the Representation of Dress in Seventeenth-Century Portraiture''</ref><ref>de Marly, \"Undress in the \u0152uvre of Lely\"</ref>\n\n=== Mantua ===\nThe ''[[mantua (clothing)|mantua]]'' or ''manteau'' was a new fashion that arose in the 1680s. Instead of a bodice and skirt cut separately, the mantua hung from the shoulders to the floor (in the manner of dresses of earlier periods) started off as the female version of the men's [[Banyan (clothing)|Banyan]], worn for 'undress' wear. Gradually it developed into a draped and pleated dress and eventually evolved into a dress worn looped and draped up over a contrasting petticoat and a stomacher. The mantua-and-stomacher resulted in a high, square neckline in contrast to the broad, off-the-shoulder neckline previously in fashion. The new look was both more modest and covered-up than previous fashions and decidedly fussy, with bows, frills, ribbons, and other trim, but the short string of pearls and pearl earrings or ''eardrops'' worn since the 1630s remained popular.\n\nThe mantua, made from a single length of fabric pleated to fit with a long train, was ideal for showing the designs of the new elaborately patterned silks that replaced the solid-colored satins popular in mid-century.<ref>Ribeiro, Aileen, on the origins of the mantua in the late 17th century, in ''Dress in Eighteenth Century Europe 1715\u20131789''; Ashelford, Jane, ''The Art of Dress''</ref>\n\n=== Hunting and riding dress ===\n\nIn a June 1666 diary entry, [[Samuel Pepys]] describes the Maids of Honour in their [[riding habit]]s of mannish coats, doublets, hats, and periwigs, \"so that, only for a long petticoat dragging under their men's coats, nobody could take them for women in any point whatever\". For riding [[Sidesaddle|side-saddle]], the costume had a long, trailing petticoat or skirt. This would be looped up or replaced by an ankle-length skirt for shooting or walking.\n\n=== Hairstyles and headgear ===\nEarly in the period, hair was worn in a bun at the back of the head with a cluster of curls framing the face. The curls grew more elaborate through the 1650s, then longer, until curls were hanging gracefully on the shoulder. In the 1680s hair was parted in the center with height over the temples, and by the 1690s hair was unparted, with rows of curls stacked\nhigh over the forehead.\n\nThis hairstyle was often topped with a ''[[fontange]]'', a frilly cap of lace wired to stand in vertical tiers with streamers to either side, named for [[Ang\u00e9lique de Fontanges|a mistress of the French King]]. This was popular from the 1690s to the first few years of the 18th century.\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Style gallery 1650s ===\n<gallery>\nFile:Charlotte von Hessen-Kassel um 1650.jpg|1 \u2013 1650\nFile:Honthorst Roodere detail.jpg|2 \u2013 1652\nFile:Maria Stuart als weduwe van Willem II Rijksmuseum SK-A-142.jpeg|3 \u2013 1652\nFile:Diego Vel\u00e1zquez 030.jpg|4 \u2013 1653\nFile:Gerard ter Borch d.

His blue waistcoat has wide buttonholes, and he wears his own hair for outdoor activity. Self-portrait, 1699.]]\nWith the end of the [[Thirty Years' War]], the fashions of the 1650s and early 1660s imitated the new peaceful and more relaxed feeling in Europe. The military [[boot]]s gave way to shoes, and a mania for baggy breeches, short coats, and hundreds of yards of ribbon set the style. The breeches (see [[Petticoat breeches]]) became so baggy that [[Samuel Pepys]] wrote in his diary: \"And among other things, met with Mr. Townsend, who told of his mistake the other day to put both his legs through one of his Knees of his breeches, and so went all day.\" (April 1661) The wide breeches that made such an error possible were soon being gathered at the knee: Pepys noted, 19 April 1663 \"this day put on my close-kneed coloured suit, which, with new stockings of the colour, with belt, and new gilt-handled sword, is very handsome.\" This era was also one of great variation and transition.\n\nIn 1666, [[Charles II of England, Scotland and Ireland]], following the earlier example of [[Louis XIV of France]], decreed that at court, men were to wear a long coat, a [[waistcoat|vest or waistcoat]] (originally called a ''petticoat'', a term which later became applied solely to women's dress), a [[necktie|cravat]], a [[wig (hair)|periwig or wig]], and [[breeches]] gathered at the knee, as well as a [[hat]] for outdoor wear. By 1680, this more sober uniform-like outfit of coat, waistcoat, and breeches became the norm for formal dress.\n\n=== Coat and waistcoat ===\nThe unfitted looser fit of the [[1600\u20131650 in fashion|1640s]] continued into the 1650s. In the 1650s, [[sleeve]]s ranged from above to below the elbow. The sleeves could be slashed, unslashed, or dividing into two parts and buttoned together. The length of the coat reached the waist but by the late 1650s and early 1660s, the coat became very short, only reaching the bottom of the rib cage, much like a bolero jacket. During the 1660s, the sleeves varied a lot from elbow length to no sleeves at all. The coat could be worn opened or buttoned in the front. One common factor were many yards of ribbon loops arranged on the shoulders and the lower parts of the sleeves.\n\nA longer and rather baggy coat (still with sleeves rarely going below the elbow) made an appearance in the early 1660s and as the decade progressed became the most popular coat. By the late 1660s, an upturned cuff became popular although the sleeves had still remained above the elbows. By the 1670s, a vest or waistcoat was worn under the coat. It was usually made of contrasting, often luxurious, fabric, and might have a plain back since that was not seen under the coat. It was a long garment which by the 1680s reached just above the knees. With the end of the 1670s the sleeves became longer and the coat more fitted. The 1680s saw larger upturned cuffs and the waist of the coat became much wider. The coat could have lapels or none. This coat is known as the ''[[justacorps]]''. The pockets on both sides of the coats were arranged horizontally or vertically (especially the mid to late 1680s) until the 1690s when the pockets were usually always arranged horizontally. The waistcoat could be sleeveless or have long sleeves. Typically, a long-sleeved waistcoat was worn in winter for added warmth. By the mid-1680s, ribbons were reduced to one side of the shoulder until by the 1690s, they were gone.\n\n=== Shirt, collar and cravat ===\nThe ruffled long-sleeved white [[shirt]] remained the only constant throughout the period, although less of it was seen with the advent of the waistcoat.\n\nDuring the early to mid-1650s, a rather small falling [[collar (clothing)|collar]] was in fashion. This increased in size and encompassed much of the shoulders by 1660. [[Cravat]]s and [[Jabot (neckwear)|jabots]] around the neck started to be worn during the early 1660s (initially with the falling collar). By the mid-1660s, the collar had disappeared with just the cravat remaining, sometimes tied with a small bow of ribbon. Red was the most common color for the bow, although pink, blue, and other colors were also used. By the 1670s, the bow of ribbons had increased in size and in the 1680s, the bow of ribbons became very large and intricate with many loops of ribbon. By the mid-1690s, the very large bow of ribbons was discarded. Also, a new style of cravat made its appearance in the 1690s, the ''Steinkerk'' (named after the [[Steenkerque|Battle of Steenkerque]] in 1692). Before, the cravat was always worn flowing down the chest; the Steinkerk cravat looped through a buttonhole of the coat.\n\n=== Breeches and stockings ===\nThe previous decade saw [[Spanish breeches]] as the most popular. These were stiff breeches which fell above or just below the knee and were rather moderately fitted. By the mid-1650s, in Western Europe, much looser, uncollected breeches, called [[petticoat breeches]] became the most popular. As the 1650s progressed, they became larger and looser, very much giving the impression of a lady's [[petticoat]]. They were usually decorated with many yards of ribbon around the waist and around the ungathered knee on the outside of the leg. Alongside the petticoat breeches, a collected but still loose fitted breeches called [[rhinegraves]], were also worn. By the early 1660s, their popularity surpassed petticoat breeches. They were usually worn with an overskirt over them. The overskirt was heavily decorated with ribbon on the waist and the bottom of the skirt. Its length was usually just above the knee, but could also extend past the knee so that the rhinegraves underneath could not be seen and only the bottom of the stocking-tops was visible.\n\nWith the rising popularity of the longer coat and waistcoat, the large collected rhinegraves and overskirt were abandoned in favor of more close fitting breeches. By the late 1670s, close fitted breeches were worn with the stockings worn over them and on or above the knee, often being gartered with a garter below the knee. With the long waistcoat and stockings worn over the knee, very little of the breeches could be seen. A possible reason that the stockings were worn over the knee, was to give the impression of longer legs since the waist coat fell very low, just above the knee. The breeches tended to be of the same material as the coat. The stockings varied in color.\n\n=== Footwear and accessories ===\nShoes again became the most popular footwear during the 1650s, although boots remained in use for riding and outdoor pursuits. ''[[Boothose]]'', originally of linen with lace cuffs and worn over the fine silk stockings to protect them from wear, remained in fashion even when boots lost their popularity. Boothose lasted well in the mid-1660s, attached right under where the rhinegraves were gathered below the knee, or fashionably slouched and unfastened. Shoes from the 1650s through the 1670s tended to be square toed and slightly long in appearance. Usually the shoes were tied with ribbon and decorated with bows. By the 1680s, the shoe became a bit more fitted; the heel increased in height (with red heels being very popular, especially for attendance at Court), and only a small ribbon if any remained.\n\nThe [[baldric]] (a sword hanger worn across one shoulder) was worn until the mid-1680s, when it was replaced by the sword belt (a sword hanger worn across the hips).\n\n=== Hairstyles ===\n[[File:Ex-voto a sainte-genevieve -Detail-Largilliere.jpg|right|thumb|The elaborate wig of the 1690s]]\nThroughout the period, men wore their hair long with curls well past the shoulders. The bangs (fringe) were usually combed forward and allowed to flow over the forehead a bit. Although men had worn wigs for years to cover up thinning hair or baldness, the popularity of the wig or periwig as standard wardrobe is usually credited to King Louis XIV of France. Louis started to go bald at a relatively young age and had to cover up his baldness with wigs. His early wigs very much imitated what were the hairstyles of the day, but they gave a thicker and fuller appearance than natural hair. Due to the success of the wigs, other men started to wear wigs as well. By 1680, a part in the middle of the wig became the norm. The hair on either side of the part continued to grow in the 1680s until by the 1690s two very high pronounced points developed on the forehead. As well, during the 1680s, the wig was divided into three parts: the front including the center part and the long curls which fell well past the shoulders, the back of the head which was combed rather close to the head, and a mass of curls which flowed down the shoulders and back. The curls of the wig throughout the 1660s until 1700 were rather loose. Tighter curls would not make their appearance until after 1700. Every natural color of wig was possible. Louis XIV tended to favor a brown wig. His son, [[Louis, the Grand Dauphin|Monseigneur]] was well known for wearing blond wigs. Facial hair declined in popularity during this period although thin moustaches remained popular up until the 1680s.\n\n=== Hats and headgear ===\n[[Hat]]s vary greatly during this period. Hats with very tall crowns, derived from the earlier [[capotain]] but with flat crowns, were popular until the end of the 1650s. The brims varied as well. Hats were decorated with feathers. By the 1660s, a very small hat with a very low crown, little brim, and large amount of feathers was popular among the French courtiers. Later in the 1660s, very large brims and moderate crowns became popular. Sometimes one side of the brim would be turned up. These continued fashionable well into the 1680s. From the 1680s until 1700, various styles and combinations of upturned brims were in fashion, from one brim upturned to three brims upturned (the ''tricorne''). Even the angle at which the brims were situated on the head varied. Sometimes with a tricorne, the point would meet over the forehead or it would be set at a 45 degree angle from the forehead.\n\n=== Style gallery 1650s ===\n<gallery>\nFile:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 097.jpg|1 \u2013 1654\nFile:Dr\u00e4kt fr\u00e5n 1654 - Livrustkammaren - 30283.tif|2 \u2013 1654\nFile:Emanuel De Geer, 1624-1692 (Bartholomeus van der Helst) - Nationalmuseum - 77290.tif|3 \u2013 1656 \nFile:Dutch1658.JPG|4 \u2013 1658\n</gallery>\n# [[:File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 097.jpg|Coat]] of 1654 has many tiny buttons on the front and sleeves, which are left unfastened below the chest and upper arm.

The men's long, narrow coats are trimmed with gold braid. c.1730\u20131740]]\n'''Fashion in the period 1700\u20131750''' in [[Europe]]an and European-influenced countries is characterized by a widening silhouette for both men and women following the tall, narrow look of the [[1650\u20131700 in fashion|1680s and 90s]]. This era is defined as late Baroque/Rococo style. The new fashion trends introduced during this era had a greater impact on society, affecting not only royalty and aristocrats, but also middle and even lower classes. Clothing during this time can be characterized by soft pastels, light, airy, and asymmetrical designs, and playful styles. Wigs remained essential for men and women of substance, and were often white; natural hair was powdered to achieve the fashionable look. The costume of the eighteenth century, if lacking in the refinement and grace of earlier times, was distinctly quaint and picturesque <ref>George Clinch, ''English Costume from Prehistoric Times to the End of the Eighteenth Century'' (London: Forgotten Books, 2015), p.115.</ref>\n\nDistinction was made in this period between ''full dress'' worn at court and for formal occasions, and ''undress'' or everyday, daytime clothes. As the decades progressed, fewer and fewer occasions called for full dress, which had all but disappeared by the end of the century.\n\nFashion designers became more recognizable during this period, as men and women were eager to be dressed in the latest trends and styles. Fashion magazines emerged during this era, originally aimed at intelligent readers, but quickly capturing the attention of lower classes with their colorful illustrations and up-to-date fashion news.\n\n==Women's fashion==\n\n===Gowns and dresses===<!-- This section is linked from [[Antoine Watteau]] --> \n[[File:Phillips Tea Party.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A rigid, upright posture with a sharp \"break\" at the bust is characteristic of the stiffly boned stays of the 1730s. These English ladies wear formal mantuas for tea.]]\n[[File:Elisabeth Christine of Braunschweig Wolfenbuettel.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Empress Elisabeth Christine in riding costume.]]\nIn the early decades of the new century, formal dress consisted of the stiff-bodiced [[Mantua (clothing)|mantua]]. A closed (or \"round\") [[petticoat]], sometimes worn with an apron, replaced the open draped mantua skirt of the [[1650\u20131700 in fashion|previous period]].  This formal style then gave way to more relaxed fashions.\n\nThe ''robe \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise'' or [[sack-back gown]] had a tight bodice with a low-cut square neckline, usually with large ribbon bows down the front, wide panniers, and was lavishly trimmed with all manner of lace, ribbon, and flowers. With flowing pleats from the shoulders was originally an undress fashion. At its most informal, this gown was unfitted both front and back and called a ''sacque''. With a more relaxed style came a shift away from heavy fabrics, such as satin and velvet, to Indian cotton, silks and damasks. Also, these gowns were often made in lighter pastel shades that gave off a warm, graceful and childlike appearance.<ref>Kemper, Rachel H., \"Costume,\" pg. 105 (1992)</ref>  Later, for formal wear, the front was fitted to the body by means of a tightly-laced underbodice, while the back fell in loose box pleats called \"Watteau pleats\" from their appearance in the paintings of [[Antoine Watteau]].\n\nThe less formal ''robe \u00e0 l'anglaise'', [[Close-bodied gown]] or \"nightgown\" also had a pleated back, but the pleats were sewn down to fit the bodice to the body to the waist. It featured a snug bodice with a full skirt worn without panniers, usually cut a bit longer in the back to form a small train, and often some type of lace kerchief was worn around the neckline.\n\nEither gown could be closed in front (a \"round gown\") or open to reveal a matching or contrasting [[petticoat]].\nOpen-fronted bodices could be filled in with a decorative [[stomacher]], and toward the end of the period a lace or linen kerchief called a ''fichu'' could be worn to fill in the low neckline.\n\nSleeves were bell- or trumpet-shaped, and caught up at the elbow to show the frilled or lace-trimmed sleeves of the [[shift (clothing)|shift]] ([[chemise]]) beneath. Sleeves became narrower as the period progressed, with a frill at the elbow, and elaborate separate ruffles called [[engageante]]s were [[tack (sewing)|tacked]] to the shift sleeves, in a fashion that would persist into the [[1750\u20131795 in fashion|1770s]].\n\nNecklines on dresses became more open as time went on allowing for greater display of ornamentation of the neck area. A thick band of lace was often sewed onto the neckline of a gown with ribbons, flowers, and/or jewels adorning the lace. Jewelry such as strings of [[pearl]]s, ribbons, or lace frills were tied high on the neck. Finally, one other large element of 18th century women's dress wear became the addition of the frilled neckband, a separate piece from the rest of the dress. This ornament was popularized sometime around 1730 .<ref>B. Payne, \"Women's Costume of the Fifteenth Century\", History of Costume: From the Ancient Egyptians to the Twentieth Century (1965)</ref>\n\n===Underwear===\nThe ''stays'' or [[corset]] of the early 18th century were long-waisting and cut with a narrow back, wide front, and shoulder straps; the most fashionable stays pulled the shoulders back until the shoulder blades almost touched.  The resulting  silhouette, with shoulders thrown back, very erect posture and a high, full bosom, is characteristic of this period and no other.\n\nSkirts were worn over small, domed [[hoop skirt|hoops]], called panniers, in the 1730s and early 1740s. Depending on the occasion, these panniers varied in size. Smaller hoops were worn in everyday settings and larger hoops for more formal occasions, which later widened to as much as three feet to either side at the French court of [[Marie Antoinette]].\n\nThe shift ([[chemise]]) or smock had full sleeves early in the period and tight, elbow-length sleeves in the 1740s as the sleeves of the gown narrowed.\n\nSome women wore drawers (underpants) in England. For instance, as early as 1676 inventory of Hillard Veren had \"3 pair of women drawers\". Although, they are not common in English or New England inventories during the 17th and 18th century. Clothing Through American History: The British Colonial Era, by Kathleen A. Staples, Madelyn C. Shaw page 245\n\nWoolen waistcoats were worn over the corset and under the gown for warmth, as were petticoats quilted with wool batting.\n\n[[Handbag|Free-hanging pockets]] were tied around the waist and were accessed through ''pocket slits'' in the gown or petticoat.\n\nLoose gowns, sometimes with a wrapped or surplice front closure, were worn over the shift ([[chemise]]), petticoat and stays (corset) for at-home wear, and it was fashionable to have one's portrait painted wearing these fashions.\n\n===Outerwear===\n[[Riding habit]]s consisted of a fitted, thigh- or knee-length coat similar to those worn by men, usually with a matching petticoat. Ladies wore masculine-inspired shirts and tricorne hats for riding and hunting.\n\nWhen outdoors, ladies also wore elbow-length capes, often lined with fur for warmth.\n\n===Fabrics and colors===\n\nIn the early years of this period, pastel silk hoods and light colors became fashionable at the French court for mature women, under the influence of [[Madame de Maintenon]]. Younger women also wore light or bright colors, but the preference was for solid-colored or floral silks with ornamentation.\n\nGradually, trim in the form of applied lace and fabric ''robings'' (strips of ruched, gathered or pleated fabric) replaced the plain style.  Ribbon bows, lacing, and rosettes became popular, as did boldly patterned fabrics. Silk gowns and [[stomacher]]s were often intricately embroidered in floral and life motifs, demonstrating great attention to detail and care for an accurate portrayal of nature.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ashelford|first=Jane|title=The Art of Dress Clothes and Society 1500-1914|year=1996|publisher=National Trust Enterprises Limited|location=Great Britain|isbn=0-8109-6317-5|page=128}}</ref>   A mid-century vogue for striped fabrics had the stripes running different directions on the trim and the body of the gown.\n\n[[Chintz]], Indian cotton fabric with block-printed imaging on a white base, was wildly fashionable.  Bans against their importation to protect the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[silk]], [[linen]] and [[wool]]en industries did nothing to reduce their desirability.  Brocaded silks and woolens had similar colorful floral patterns on light-colored grounds.  Blends of wool and silk or wool and linen ([[linsey-woolsey]]) were popular. Until the 1730s, European textiles were of inferior quality that could not match the complex fashionable designs of [[Calico (textile)|Indian calicoes]]. Europe was able to produce high quality petit teints (colors that faded with light and washing), but they were unable to produce grand teints (permanent colors resistant to light and wear).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lemire|first=Beverly|last2=Reillo|first2=Giorgie|title=East & West: Textiles and Fashion in Early Modern Europe|journal=Journal of Social History|year=2008|volume=41|issue=4|series=4|pages=887\u2013916|doi=10.1353/jsh.0.0019|url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/190/1/WRAP_Riello_Final_Article.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Footwear and accessories===\n[[File:18th century shoes mules.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Shoes of 1742 (left) and 1731 (right).]]\nThe '''[[shoe]]''' of the [[1650\u20131700 in fashion|previous period]] with its curved heel, squarish toe, and tie over the instep gave way in the second decade of the 18th century to a shoe with a high, curved heel.

This was overlaid with white powder (typically potato or rice powder), rouge, and deep red or cherry lip color.\n\nTiny pieces of fabric, known as patches, in the shapes of dots, hearts, stars, etc. were applied to the face with adhesive. The fashion is thought to have originated as a way of disguising pox scars and other blemishes, but gradually developed coded meanings.

This was a long, straight, close-fitting type of coat which his courtiers described as 'oriental'. It had pockets but no collar and it buttoned from neck to hem<ref>(Byrde 1979)</ref>\n\n====Coat====\nWhen the coat began to be worn in the 1600s, it was cut with little shaping to the figure and hung loosely from the shoulders to just below the knee. There were long vents from waist to hem at the sides and center-back, generally edged with buttons and buttonholes. During the 1670s and 1680s, the coat became closer-fitting with a slight shaping at the waist to produce a longer, narrower, more severe line. Sleeves were worn longer and tighter but still with cuffs. The slim, straight line was emphasized by low-set vertical pockets, but in the late 1680s, these were largely replaced by horizontal pockets which were later given flaps.<ref>(Byrde 1979)</ref>\n\n====Breeches====\nKnee-breeches had a center-front opening, fastened at the waist, and were worn without other support. The legs were gathered into a band above or below the knee, closing with ties, buttons or a buckle or strap. Stockings were drawn up over the knees and covered the lower edge of the breeches.<ref>(Byrde 1979)</ref>\n\n===Footwear===\n\nIn the early 18th century, men's shoes continued to have a squared toe, but the heels were not as high. From 1720-1730, the heels became even smaller, and the shoes became more comfortable, no longer containing a block toe. The shoes from the first half of the century often contained an oblong buckle usually embedded with stones.<ref>{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Geoffrey|title=Fashion Accessories Since 1500|url=https://archive.org/details/fashionaccessori00warr|url-access=registration|year=1987|publisher=Drama Book Publishers|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/fashionaccessori00warr/page/62 62], 67}}</ref>\n\n=== Accessories===\n\nUpper-class men often wore a cane as part of their outfits, suspending it by a loop from one of their [[waistcoat]] buttons to allow their hands to properly hold snuff-boxes or handkerchiefs.

During this time various colors were worn, but white was becoming more popular and the curls were getting tighter. The cadogan style of men's hair developed and became popular during this period, with horizontal rolls of hair over the ears. Later, wigs or the natural hair were worn long, brushed back from the forehead and ''clubbed'' or tied back at the nape of the neck with a black ribbon. From about 1720, a bag wig gathered the back hair in a black silk bag. Black ribbons attached to the bag were brought to the front and tied in a bow in a style called a \"solitaire\".\n\nWide-brimmed [[hat]]s with brims turned up on three sides into [[tricorne]]s were worn throughout the era. They were an essential element to the \"domino\", a stylish costume for masquerade balls, which became an increasingly popular mode of entertainment. The \"domino\" style consisted of a mask, a long cape, and a [[tricorne]] [[hat]], all usually constructed of dark colors.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ribiero|first=Aileen|title=The Dress Worn at Masquerades in England 1730 to 1790|year=1984|publisher=Garland|location=New York, NY|pages=3}}</ref>\n\n===Style gallery===\n====1700s\u20131720s====\n<gallery>\nImage:James Thornhill Portrait of Sir Isaac Newton.jpg|1 \u2013 c. 1710\nImage:Louis XIV in1711.PNG|2 \u2013 1711\nImage:114Friedrich Ludwig.jpg|3 \u2013 1716\nImage:Watteau ensign detail.jpg|4 \u2013 1721\n</gallery>\n#[[:Image:James Thornhill Portrait of Sir Isaac Newton.jpg|Sir Isaac Newton]] in old age, 1709\u20131712.

''[[Leading strings]]''\u2014narrow straps of fabric attached to the gown at the shoulder\u2014functioned as a sort of leash to keep the child from straying too far or falling as they learned to walk.\n\nChildren older than toddlers continued to wear clothing which was in many respects simply a smaller version of adult clothing.  Although it is often said that children wore miniature versions of adult clothing, this is something of a myth.  Girls wore back-fastening gowns, trimmed much more simply than women's. The skirt of a girl's gown was not split down the front, as women's typically were.<ref name=\"Art\">Ashelford, Jane, ''The Art of Dress''</ref>  Girls did not wear jackets or bedgowns.  Boys wore shirts, breeches, waistcoats and coats a man would, but often wore their necks open, and the coat was fitted and trimmed differently from a man's, and boys often went bareheaded.  During some decades of the 18th Century, boys' shirts and coats had different collars and cuffs than a man's.  Even if the size is not apparent, it is usually possible to tell a child's garment from an adult's.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Eleonor Darnhall by Justus Engelhardt K\u00fchn.jpg|1 \u2013 1710\nImage:Watteau the dance.jpg|2 \u2013 1718\nImage:Balthasar Denner 001.jpg|3 \u2013 1724\nImage:Andreas_Moeller_-_Erzherzogin_Maria_Theresia_-_Kunsthistorisches_Museum.jpg|4 \u2013 1727\nImage:William Hogarth 060.jpg|5 \u2013 1731\u201332\nFile:Henry Benedict Maria Clement Stuart, Cardinal York by Louis Gabriel Blanchet.jpg|6 \u2013 1738\nImage:Jean-Baptiste_Sim\u00e9on_Chardin_002.jpg|7 \u2013 1740\nImage:William Hogarth 047.jpg|8 \u2013 1745\n</gallery>\n\n1.A simple trimmed lace and cloth dress English/French cut.

The men's long, narrow coats are trimmed with gold braid. c.1730\u20131740]]\n'''Fashion in the period 1700\u20131750''' in [[Europe]]an and European-influenced countries is characterized by a widening silhouette for both men and women following the tall, narrow look of the [[1650\u20131700 in fashion|1680s and 90s]]. This era is defined as late Baroque/Rococo style. The new fashion trends introduced during this era had a greater impact on society, affecting not only royalty and aristocrats, but also middle and even lower classes. Clothing during this time can be characterized by soft pastels, light, airy, and asymmetrical designs, and playful styles. Wigs remained essential for men and women of substance, and were often white; natural hair was powdered to achieve the fashionable look. The costume of the eighteenth century, if lacking in the refinement and grace of earlier times, was distinctly quaint and picturesque <ref>George Clinch, ''English Costume from Prehistoric Times to the End of the Eighteenth Century'' (London: Forgotten Books, 2015), p.115.</ref>\n\nDistinction was made in this period between ''full dress'' worn at court and for formal occasions, and ''undress'' or everyday, daytime clothes. As the decades progressed, fewer and fewer occasions called for full dress, which had all but disappeared by the end of the century.\n\nFashion designers became more recognizable during this period, as men and women were eager to be dressed in the latest trends and styles. Fashion magazines emerged during this era, originally aimed at intelligent readers, but quickly capturing the attention of lower classes with their colorful illustrations and up-to-date fashion news.\n\n==Women's fashion==\n\n===Gowns and dresses===<!-- This section is linked from [[Antoine Watteau]] --> \n[[File:Phillips Tea Party.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A rigid, upright posture with a sharp \"break\" at the bust is characteristic of the stiffly boned stays of the 1730s. These English ladies wear formal mantuas for tea.]]\n[[File:Elisabeth Christine of Braunschweig Wolfenbuettel.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Empress Elisabeth Christine in riding costume.]]\nIn the early decades of the new century, formal dress consisted of the stiff-bodiced [[Mantua (clothing)|mantua]]. A closed (or \"round\") [[petticoat]], sometimes worn with an apron, replaced the open draped mantua skirt of the [[1650\u20131700 in fashion|previous period]].  This formal style then gave way to more relaxed fashions.\n\nThe ''robe \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise'' or [[sack-back gown]] had a tight bodice with a low-cut square neckline, usually with large ribbon bows down the front, wide panniers, and was lavishly trimmed with all manner of lace, ribbon, and flowers. With flowing pleats from the shoulders was originally an undress fashion. At its most informal, this gown was unfitted both front and back and called a ''sacque''. With a more relaxed style came a shift away from heavy fabrics, such as satin and velvet, to Indian cotton, silks and damasks. Also, these gowns were often made in lighter pastel shades that gave off a warm, graceful and childlike appearance.<ref>Kemper, Rachel H., \"Costume,\" pg. 105 (1992)</ref>  Later, for formal wear, the front was fitted to the body by means of a tightly-laced underbodice, while the back fell in loose box pleats called \"Watteau pleats\" from their appearance in the paintings of [[Antoine Watteau]].\n\nThe less formal ''robe \u00e0 l'anglaise'', [[Close-bodied gown]] or \"nightgown\" also had a pleated back, but the pleats were sewn down to fit the bodice to the body to the waist. It featured a snug bodice with a full skirt worn without panniers, usually cut a bit longer in the back to form a small train, and often some type of lace kerchief was worn around the neckline.\n\nEither gown could be closed in front (a \"round gown\") or open to reveal a matching or contrasting [[petticoat]].\nOpen-fronted bodices could be filled in with a decorative [[stomacher]], and toward the end of the period a lace or linen kerchief called a ''fichu'' could be worn to fill in the low neckline.\n\nSleeves were bell- or trumpet-shaped, and caught up at the elbow to show the frilled or lace-trimmed sleeves of the [[shift (clothing)|shift]] ([[chemise]]) beneath. Sleeves became narrower as the period progressed, with a frill at the elbow, and elaborate separate ruffles called [[engageante]]s were [[tack (sewing)|tacked]] to the shift sleeves, in a fashion that would persist into the [[1750\u20131795 in fashion|1770s]].\n\nNecklines on dresses became more open as time went on allowing for greater display of ornamentation of the neck area. A thick band of lace was often sewed onto the neckline of a gown with ribbons, flowers, and/or jewels adorning the lace. Jewelry such as strings of [[pearl]]s, ribbons, or lace frills were tied high on the neck. Finally, one other large element of 18th century women's dress wear became the addition of the frilled neckband, a separate piece from the rest of the dress. This ornament was popularized sometime around 1730 .<ref>B. Payne, \"Women's Costume of the Fifteenth Century\", History of Costume: From the Ancient Egyptians to the Twentieth Century (1965)</ref>\n\n===Underwear===\nThe ''stays'' or [[corset]] of the early 18th century were long-waisting and cut with a narrow back, wide front, and shoulder straps; the most fashionable stays pulled the shoulders back until the shoulder blades almost touched.  The resulting  silhouette, with shoulders thrown back, very erect posture and a high, full bosom, is characteristic of this period and no other.\n\nSkirts were worn over small, domed [[hoop skirt|hoops]], called panniers, in the 1730s and early 1740s. Depending on the occasion, these panniers varied in size. Smaller hoops were worn in everyday settings and larger hoops for more formal occasions, which later widened to as much as three feet to either side at the French court of [[Marie Antoinette]].\n\nThe shift ([[chemise]]) or smock had full sleeves early in the period and tight, elbow-length sleeves in the 1740s as the sleeves of the gown narrowed.\n\nSome women wore drawers (underpants) in England. For instance, as early as 1676 inventory of Hillard Veren had \"3 pair of women drawers\". Although, they are not common in English or New England inventories during the 17th and 18th century. Clothing Through American History: The British Colonial Era, by Kathleen A. Staples, Madelyn C. Shaw page 245\n\nWoolen waistcoats were worn over the corset and under the gown for warmth, as were petticoats quilted with wool batting.\n\n[[Handbag|Free-hanging pockets]] were tied around the waist and were accessed through ''pocket slits'' in the gown or petticoat.\n\nLoose gowns, sometimes with a wrapped or surplice front closure, were worn over the shift ([[chemise]]), petticoat and stays (corset) for at-home wear, and it was fashionable to have one's portrait painted wearing these fashions.\n\n===Outerwear===\n[[Riding habit]]s consisted of a fitted, thigh- or knee-length coat similar to those worn by men, usually with a matching petticoat. Ladies wore masculine-inspired shirts and tricorne hats for riding and hunting.\n\nWhen outdoors, ladies also wore elbow-length capes, often lined with fur for warmth.\n\n===Fabrics and colors===\n\nIn the early years of this period, pastel silk hoods and light colors became fashionable at the French court for mature women, under the influence of [[Madame de Maintenon]]. Younger women also wore light or bright colors, but the preference was for solid-colored or floral silks with ornamentation.\n\nGradually, trim in the form of applied lace and fabric ''robings'' (strips of ruched, gathered or pleated fabric) replaced the plain style.  Ribbon bows, lacing, and rosettes became popular, as did boldly patterned fabrics. Silk gowns and [[stomacher]]s were often intricately embroidered in floral and life motifs, demonstrating great attention to detail and care for an accurate portrayal of nature.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ashelford|first=Jane|title=The Art of Dress Clothes and Society 1500-1914|year=1996|publisher=National Trust Enterprises Limited|location=Great Britain|isbn=0-8109-6317-5|page=128}}</ref>   A mid-century vogue for striped fabrics had the stripes running different directions on the trim and the body of the gown.\n\n[[Chintz]], Indian cotton fabric with block-printed imaging on a white base, was wildly fashionable.  Bans against their importation to protect the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[silk]], [[linen]] and [[wool]]en industries did nothing to reduce their desirability.  Brocaded silks and woolens had similar colorful floral patterns on light-colored grounds.  Blends of wool and silk or wool and linen ([[linsey-woolsey]]) were popular. Until the 1730s, European textiles were of inferior quality that could not match the complex fashionable designs of [[Calico (textile)|Indian calicoes]]. Europe was able to produce high quality petit teints (colors that faded with light and washing), but they were unable to produce grand teints (permanent colors resistant to light and wear).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lemire|first=Beverly|last2=Reillo|first2=Giorgie|title=East & West: Textiles and Fashion in Early Modern Europe|journal=Journal of Social History|year=2008|volume=41|issue=4|series=4|pages=887\u2013916|doi=10.1353/jsh.0.0019|url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/190/1/WRAP_Riello_Final_Article.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Footwear and accessories===\n[[File:18th century shoes mules.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Shoes of 1742 (left) and 1731 (right).]]\nThe '''[[shoe]]''' of the [[1650\u20131700 in fashion|previous period]] with its curved heel, squarish toe, and tie over the instep gave way in the second decade of the 18th century to a shoe with a high, curved heel.

This was overlaid with white powder (typically potato or rice powder), rouge, and deep red or cherry lip color.\n\nTiny pieces of fabric, known as patches, in the shapes of dots, hearts, stars, etc. were applied to the face with adhesive. The fashion is thought to have originated as a way of disguising pox scars and other blemishes, but gradually developed coded meanings.

This was a long, straight, close-fitting type of coat which his courtiers described as 'oriental'. It had pockets but no collar and it buttoned from neck to hem<ref>(Byrde 1979)</ref>\n\n====Coat====\nWhen the coat began to be worn in the 1600s, it was cut with little shaping to the figure and hung loosely from the shoulders to just below the knee. There were long vents from waist to hem at the sides and center-back, generally edged with buttons and buttonholes. During the 1670s and 1680s, the coat became closer-fitting with a slight shaping at the waist to produce a longer, narrower, more severe line. Sleeves were worn longer and tighter but still with cuffs. The slim, straight line was emphasized by low-set vertical pockets, but in the late 1680s, these were largely replaced by horizontal pockets which were later given flaps.<ref>(Byrde 1979)</ref>\n\n====Breeches====\nKnee-breeches had a center-front opening, fastened at the waist, and were worn without other support. The legs were gathered into a band above or below the knee, closing with ties, buttons or a buckle or strap. Stockings were drawn up over the knees and covered the lower edge of the breeches.<ref>(Byrde 1979)</ref>\n\n===Footwear===\n\nIn the early 18th century, men's shoes continued to have a squared toe, but the heels were not as high. From 1720-1730, the heels became even smaller, and the shoes became more comfortable, no longer containing a block toe. The shoes from the first half of the century often contained an oblong buckle usually embedded with stones.<ref>{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Geoffrey|title=Fashion Accessories Since 1500|url=https://archive.org/details/fashionaccessori00warr|url-access=registration|year=1987|publisher=Drama Book Publishers|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/fashionaccessori00warr/page/62 62], 67}}</ref>\n\n=== Accessories===\n\nUpper-class men often wore a cane as part of their outfits, suspending it by a loop from one of their [[waistcoat]] buttons to allow their hands to properly hold snuff-boxes or handkerchiefs.

During this time various colors were worn, but white was becoming more popular and the curls were getting tighter. The cadogan style of men's hair developed and became popular during this period, with horizontal rolls of hair over the ears. Later, wigs or the natural hair were worn long, brushed back from the forehead and ''clubbed'' or tied back at the nape of the neck with a black ribbon. From about 1720, a bag wig gathered the back hair in a black silk bag. Black ribbons attached to the bag were brought to the front and tied in a bow in a style called a \"solitaire\".\n\nWide-brimmed [[hat]]s with brims turned up on three sides into [[tricorne]]s were worn throughout the era. They were an essential element to the \"domino\", a stylish costume for masquerade balls, which became an increasingly popular mode of entertainment. The \"domino\" style consisted of a mask, a long cape, and a [[tricorne]] [[hat]], all usually constructed of dark colors.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ribiero|first=Aileen|title=The Dress Worn at Masquerades in England 1730 to 1790|year=1984|publisher=Garland|location=New York, NY|pages=3}}</ref>\n\n===Style gallery===\n====1700s\u20131720s====\n<gallery>\nImage:James Thornhill Portrait of Sir Isaac Newton.jpg|1 \u2013 c. 1710\nImage:Louis XIV in1711.PNG|2 \u2013 1711\nImage:114Friedrich Ludwig.jpg|3 \u2013 1716\nImage:Watteau ensign detail.jpg|4 \u2013 1721\n</gallery>\n#[[:Image:James Thornhill Portrait of Sir Isaac Newton.jpg|Sir Isaac Newton]] in old age, 1709\u20131712.

Although it is often said that children wore miniature versions of adult clothing, this is something of a myth.  Girls wore back-fastening gowns, trimmed much more simply than women's. The skirt of a girl's gown was not split down the front, as women's typically were.<ref name=\"Art\">Ashelford, Jane, ''The Art of Dress''</ref>  Girls did not wear jackets or bedgowns.  Boys wore shirts, breeches, waistcoats and coats a man would, but often wore their necks open, and the coat was fitted and trimmed differently from a man's, and boys often went bareheaded.  During some decades of the 18th Century, boys' shirts and coats had different collars and cuffs than a man's.  Even if the size is not apparent, it is usually possible to tell a child's garment from an adult's.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Eleonor Darnhall by Justus Engelhardt K\u00fchn.jpg|1 \u2013 1710\nImage:Watteau the dance.jpg|2 \u2013 1718\nImage:Balthasar Denner 001.jpg|3 \u2013 1724\nImage:Andreas_Moeller_-_Erzherzogin_Maria_Theresia_-_Kunsthistorisches_Museum.jpg|4 \u2013 1727\nImage:William Hogarth 060.jpg|5 \u2013 1731\u201332\nFile:Henry Benedict Maria Clement Stuart, Cardinal York by Louis Gabriel Blanchet.jpg|6 \u2013 1738\nImage:Jean-Baptiste_Sim\u00e9on_Chardin_002.jpg|7 \u2013 1740\nImage:William Hogarth 047.jpg|8 \u2013 1745\n</gallery>\n\n1.A simple trimmed lace and cloth dress English/French cut.

Costume historian [[James Laver]] suggests that the mid-14th century marks the emergence of recognizable \"[[fashion]]\" in clothing,<ref>Laver, James: ''The Concise History of Costume and Fashion'', Abrams, 1979, p. 62</ref> in which [[Fernand Braudel]] concurs.<ref>Fernand Braudel, ''Civilization and Capitalism, 15th-18th Centuries, Vol 1: The Structures of Everyday Life,\" p. 317, William Collins & Sons, London 1981</ref> The draped garments and straight seams of previous centuries were replaced by curved seams and the beginnings of [[tailor]]ing, which allowed clothing to more closely fit the human form. Also, the use of lacing and buttons allowed a more snug fit to clothing.<ref>Singman, Jeffrey L. and Will McLean: ''Daily Life in Chaucer's England'', page 93. Greenwood Press, London, 2005 {{ISBN|0-313-29375-9}}</ref>\n\nIn the course of the century the length of female hem-lines progressively reduced, and by the end of the century it was fashionable for men to omit the long loose over-garment of previous centuries (whether called tunic, kirtle, or other names)  altogether, putting the emphasis on a tailored top that fell a little below the waist\u2014a silhouette that is still reflected in men's costume today.<ref>See discussion in Laver: ''The Concise History of Costume and Fashion''</ref>\n\n==Fabrics and furs==\n[[Image:The Wilton Diptych (left).jpg|thumb|left|The young [[Richard II of England]], kneeling, wears a [[houppelande]] of silk brocade with the badge of his [[livery]].

Trade in textiles continued to grow throughout the century and formed an important part of the economy for many areas from England to Italy. Clothes were very expensive, and employees, even high-ranking officials, were usually supplied with, typically, one outfit per year, as part of their remuneration.\n\n[[Image:Psalter of Mary de Bohun and Henry Bolingbroke 1380-85 Abigail.jpg|thumb|Mary de Bohun wears an ermine-lined mantle tied with red strings.

[[Embroidery]] in wool, and silk or gold thread for the rich were used for decoration. [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] established an embroidery workshop in the [[Tower of London]], which presumably produced the robes he and his Queen wore in 1351 of red velvet \"embroidered with clouds of silver and eagles of pearl and gold, under each alternate cloud an eagle of pearl, and under each of the other clouds a golden eagle, every eagle having in its beak a Garter with the motto ''[[Order of the Garter|hony soyt qui mal y pense]]'' embroidered thereon.\"<ref>Donald King in Jonathan Alexander & Paul Binski (eds), op cit, p 160</ref>\n\n[[Silk]] was the finest fabric of all.

Anderson, and Madge Garland: ''A History of Fashion'', 1975, {{ISBN|0-688-02893-4}}, p. 122</ref> and was especially popular at the English court.  Sometimes just the hose would be different colours on each leg.\n\nCheckered and plaid fabrics were occasionally seen; a parti-coloured [[Kirtle|cotehardie]] depicted on the St. Vincent altarpiece in Catalonia is reddish-brown on one side and plaid on the other, and remains of plaid and checkered wool fabrics dating to the 14th century have also been discovered in London.<ref>Crowfoot, Elizabeth, Frances Pruchard and Kay Staniland, ''Textiles and Clothing c. 1150 \u2013 c. 1450'', Museum of London, 1992, {{ISBN|0-11-290445-9}},</ref>\n\n[[Fur]] was mostly worn as an inner [[lining (sewing)|lining]] for warmth; inventories from [[Burgundy|Burgundian]] villages show that even there a fur-lined coat (rabbit, or the more expensive cat) was one of the most common garments.<ref>[[Georges Duby]] ed.,''A History of Private Life, Vol 2 Revelations of the Medieval World'', 1988 (English translation), p.571, Belknap Press, Harvard U</ref> [[Vair]], the fur of the squirrel, white on the belly and grey on the back, was particularly popular through most of the century and can be seen in many [[illuminated manuscript]] illustrations, where it is shown as a white and blue-grey softly striped or checkered pattern lining cloaks and other outer garments; the white belly fur with the merest edging of grey was called miniver.<ref name=\"Med1\">Netherton, Robin, \"The Tippet: Accessory after Fact?\", in Robin Netherton and Gale R.

Hose were generally tied to the breech belt, or to the breeches themselves, or to a [[Doublet (clothing)|doublet]].<ref name=\"McLean page 101\"/>\n\nA doublet was a buttoned jacket that was generally of hip length. Similar garments were called [[cotehardie]], ''pourpoint'', ''jaqueta'' or ''jub\u00f3n''.<ref>There is a famous surviving example in the Textile Museum at [[Lyon]], called the \"Pourpoint of Charles of Blois\".

However, the trend during the century was for hem-lengths to shorten for all classes.\n\nHowever, in the second half of the century, courtiers are often shown, if they have the figure for it, wearing nothing over their closely tailored cotehardie.  A French [[chronicle]] records: \"Around that year (1350), men, in particular, noblemen and their squires, took to wearing tunics so short and tight that they revealed what modesty bids us hide.  This was a most astonishing thing for the people\".<ref>Continuation of a chronicle of [[Guillaume de Nangis]], Archives Nationales, Paris.  Quoted in: Fernand Braudel, ''Civilization and Capitalism, 15th-18th Centuries, Vol 1: The Structures of Everyday Life,\" p. 317, William Collins & Sons, London 1981</ref>\nThis fashion may well have derived from military clothing, where long loose robes were naturally not worn in action. At this period, the most dignified figures, like King Charles in the illustration, continue to wear long robes\u2014although as the Royal Chamberlain, de Vaudetar was himself a person of very high rank.  This abandonment of the robe to emphasize a tight top over the torso, with breeches or trousers below, was to become the distinctive feature of European men's fashion for centuries to come. Men had carried purses up to this time because tunics did not provide pockets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ashevillelist.com/history/medieval-clothing.htm |title=Medieval Clothing Facts and information - Medieval clothing history, fashions |publisher=Ashevillelist.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-12}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:BookoftheduchessIIIcchaucer.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chaucer]] reading his work to the court of Richard II, c. 1400]]\nThe funeral effigy and \"achievements\" of [[Edward, the Black Prince]] in [[Canterbury Cathedral]], who died in 1376, show the military version of the same outline.  Over [[Plate armour|armour]] he is shown wearing a short fitted ''arming-coat'' or ''jupon'' or ''gipon'', the original of which was hung above and still survives. This has the quartered arms of England and France, with a rather similar effect to a parti-coloured jacket.  The \"charges\" (figures) of the arms are embroidered in gold on linen pieces, [[appliqu\u00e9]]d onto coloured silk velvet fields.  It is vertically quilted, with wool stuffing and a silk satin lining.  This type of coat, originally worn out of sight under armour, was in fashion as an outer garment from about 1360 until early the next century.  Only this and a child's version (Chartres Cathedral) survive.<ref>[[Claude Blair]] in Jonathan Alexander & Paul Binski (eds), ''Age of Chivalry, Art in Plantagenet England, 1200\u20131400'', Royal Academy/Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London 1987, p 480.[http://www.forest.gen.nz/Medieval/articles/garments/blackprince/blackprince.html The effigy and arming-coat of the Black Prince]</ref>  As an indication of the rapid spread of fashion between the courts of Europe, a manuscript chronicle illuminated in Hungary by 1360 shows very [[Chronicon Pictum|similar styles]] to Edward's English version.\n\nEdward's son, King [[Richard II of England]], led a court that, like many in Europe late in the century, was extremely refined and fashion-conscious.  He himself is credited with having invented the [[handkerchief]]; \"little pieces [of cloth] for the lord King to wipe and clean his nose,\" appear in the Household Rolls (accounts), which is the first documentation of their use.  He distributed jeweled [[livery]] badges with his personal emblem of the white [[Deer|hart]] (deer) to his friends, like the one he himself wears in the [[Wilton Diptych]] (above).  In the miniature (left) of Chaucer reading to his court both men and women wear very high collars and quantities of jewelry.  The King (standing to the left of Chaucer; his face has been defaced) wears a patterned gold-coloured costume with matching hat.  Most of the men wear [[Chaperon (headgear)|chaperon]] hats, and the women have their hair elaborately dressed.  Male courtiers enjoyed wearing fancy-dress for festivities; the disastrous [[Charles VI of France#Bal des Ardents|Bal des Ardents]] in 1393 in Paris is the most famous example. Men, as well as women, wore decorated and jewelled clothes; for the entry of the [[Isabeau of Bavaria|Queen of France]] into Paris in 1389, the [[Philip II, Duke of Burgundy|Duke of Burgundy]] wore a velvet doublet embroidered with forty sheep and forty swans, each with a pearl bell around its neck.<ref>Barbara Tuchman;A Distant Mirror, 1978, Alfred A Knopf Ltd, p456, quoting Vaughan's biography of Philip.</ref>\n\nA new garment, the [[houppelande]], appeared around 1380 and was to remain fashionable well into the next century.<ref>Laver, ''Concise History of Costume and Fashion''</ref>  It was essentially a robe with fullness falling from the shoulders, very full trailing sleeves, and the high collar favored at the English court.  The extravagance of the sleeves was criticized by moralists.\n\n===Headgear and accessories===\n[[Image:20-alimenti vino rosso Taccuino Sanitatis Casanatense 4182 detail chaperon.jpg|thumb|Man wearing a chaperon, Italy, late 14th century]]\nDuring this century, the [[Chaperon (headgear)|chaperon]] made a transformation from being a utilitarian hood with a small cape to becoming a complicated and fashionable hat worn by the wealthy in town settings.  This came when they began to be worn with the opening for the face placed instead on the top of the head.\n\nBelts were worn below waist at all times, and very low on the hips with the tightly fitted fashions of the latter half of the century.  Belt pouches or purses were used, and long daggers, usually hanging diagonally to the front.\n\nIn armour, the century saw increases in the amount of [[plate armour]] worn, and by the end of the century the full suit had been developed, although mixtures of [[chain mail]] and plate remained more common.  The visored [[bascinet]] helmet was a new development in this century.  Ordinary soldiers were lucky to have a mail [[hauberk]], and perhaps some ''[[Boiled leather|cuir bouilli]]'' (\"boiled leather\") knee or shin pieces.<ref>Claude Blair, in Alexander & Binski, op cit pp 169\u201370</ref>\n\n===Style gallery===\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Braies 14th century.jpg|1 \u2013 Braies\nImage:3-piantagione Taccuino Sanitatis Casanatense 4182 shirt..jpg|2 \u2013 Shirt and braies\nImage:Luttrell servant.jpg|3 \u2013 Servant\nImage:Bologna marriage men.jpg|4 \u2013 Cotehardie and hood\nImage:Plaid cotehardie.jpg|5 \u2013 Cotehardie\nImage:37-svaghi cacciaTaccuino Sanitatis Casanatense 4182 cacciatore..jpg|6 \u2013 Huntsman\nImage:33-vento orientale Taccuino Sanitatis Casanatense 4182 detail..jpg|7 \u2013 Walking\nImage:46-aspetti di vita quotidiana discrezione Taccuino Sanitatis detail2..jpg|8 \u2013 Men's gowns\n</gallery>\n\n#[[:Image:Braies 14th century.jpg|Braies]] are worn rolled over a belt at the waist.

Many in the lower classes wore their undergarments to bed because of the cold weather at night time and since their beds usually consisted of a straw mattress and a few sheets, the undergarment would act as another layer.\n\n===Dresses and outerwear===\nOver the chemise, women wore a loose or fitted dress called a ''cotte'' or [[kirtle]], usually ankle or floor-length, and with [[train (clothing)|trains]] for formal occasions.  Fitted kirtles had wide skirts made by adding triangular gores to widen the hem without adding bulk at the waist.  Kirtles also had long, fitted sleeves that sometimes reached down to cover the knuckles.\n\nVarious sorts of robes were worn over the kirtle, and are called by different names by costume historians. When fitted, this garment is often called a [[cotehardie]] (although this usage of the word has been heavily criticized<ref>[http://www.cottesimple.com/ La Cotte Simple]</ref>) and might have hanging sleeves and sometimes worn with a jeweled or metalworked belt.  Over time, the hanging part of the sleeve became longer and narrower until it was the merest streamer, called a ''tippet'', then gaining the floral or leaflike daggings in the end of the century.<ref name=payne>Payne, Blanche: ''History of Costume from the Ancient Egyptians to the Twentieth Century'', Harper & Row, 1965</ref>\n\nSleeveless dresses or [[tabard]]s derive from the [[Cyclas (garment)|cyclas]], an unfitted rectangle of cloth with an opening for the head that was worn in the 13th century.  By the early 14th century, the sides began to be sewn together, creating a sleeveless overdress or surcoat.<ref name=payne/>\n\nOutdoors, women wore [[cloak]]s or [[mantle (clothing)|mantle]]s, often lined in fur.  The [[houppelande]] was also adopted by women late in the century.  Women invariably wore their houppelandes floor-length, the waistline rising up to right underneath the bust, sleeves very wide and hanging, like [[angel sleeves]].\n\n===Headdresses===\n\nAs one might imagine, a woman's outfit was not complete without some kind of headwear. As with today, a medieval woman had many options- from straw hats, to hoods to elaborate headpieces. A woman's activity and occasion would dictate what she wore on her head.\n\nThe Middle Ages, particularly the 14th and 15th centuries, were home to some of the most outstanding and gravity-defying headwear in history.\n\nBefore the [[hennin]] rocketed skywards, padded rolls and truncated and reticulated headdresses graced the heads of fashionable ladies everywhere in Europe and England. [[Caul (headgear)|Cauls]], the cylindrical cages worn at the side of the head and temples, added to the richness of dress of the fashionable and the well-to-do. Other more simple forms of headdress included the [[coronet]] or simple [[circlet]] of flowers.\n\n====Northern and western Europe====\nMarried women in Northern and Western Europe wore some type of headcovering.  The ''barbet'' was a band of linen that passed under the chin and was pinned on top of the head; it descended from the earlier [[wimple]] (in French, ''barbe''), which was now worn only by older women, widows, and [[nun]]s.  The barbet was worn with a linen [[Fillet (clothing)|fillet]] or headband, or with a linen cap called a [[coif]], with or without a ''couvrechef'' ([[kerchief]]) or [[Veil#History|veil]] overall.<ref>Laver, James: ''The Concise History of Costume and Fashion'', Abrams, 1979;</ref> It passed out of fashion by mid-century. Unmarried girls simply braided the hair to keep the dirt out.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Isabeau of Bavaria statue.jpg|thumb|A crespine worn by [[Isabeau of Bavaria]], Queen of France{{deletable image-caption|Monday, 26 November 2012}}]] -->\nThe barbet and fillet or barbet and veil could also be worn over the ''crespine'', a thick hairnet or [[snood (headgear)|snood]].  Over time, the crespine evolved into a mesh of jeweler's work that confined the hair on the sides of the head, and even later, at the back.  This metal crespine was also called a ''caul'', and remained stylish long after the barbet had fallen out of fashion.<ref>Payne, ''History of Costume''</ref> For example, it was used in [[Hungary]] until the beginning of the second half of the 15th century, as it was used by the Hungarian queen consort [[Barbara of Celje]] around 1440.\n\n====Italy====\nUncovered hair was acceptable for women in the Italian states.  Many women twisted their long hair with cords or ribbons and wrapped the twists around their heads, often without any cap or veil.  Hair was also worn braided.  Older women and widows wore a veil and wimple, and a simple knotted kerchief was worn while working. In the image at right, one woman wears a red hood draped over her twisted and bound hair.\n\n===Style gallery===\n<gallery>\nImage:Giotto joachim detail.jpg|1 \u2013 Italian gowns\nImage:Codex Manesse Ulrich von Singenberg detail.jpg|2 \u2013 Barbet and fillet\nImage:Luttrell women.jpg|3 \u2013 Women dining\nImage:Luttrell1 detail woman.jpg|4 \u2013 In a garden\nImage:Romance of alexander.jpg|5 \u2013 Hood\nImage:Ambrogio Lorenzetti 003.jpg|6 \u2013 Italian fashion\nImage:Bologna marriage women.jpg|7 \u2013 Bride and ladies\nImage:46-aspetti di vita quotidiana discrezione Taccuino Sanitatis detail..jpg|8 \u2013 Houppelande\nImage:El\u017cbieta \u0141okietk\u00f3wna z dzie\u0107mi.JPG|9 - Hungarian fashion ([[Elizabeth of Poland, Queen of Hungary]] and her children.

Greenwood Press, London, 2005 {{ISBN|0-313-29375-9}}</ref>\n\nIn the course of the century the length of female hem-lines progressively reduced, and by the end of the century it was fashionable for men to omit the long loose over-garment of previous centuries (whether called tunic, kirtle, or other names)  altogether, putting the emphasis on a tailored top that fell a little below the waist\u2014a silhouette that is still reflected in men's costume today.<ref>See discussion in Laver: ''The Concise History of Costume and Fashion''</ref>\n\n==Fabrics and furs==\n[[Image:The Wilton Diptych (left).jpg|thumb|left|The young [[Richard II of England]], kneeling, wears a [[houppelande]] of silk brocade with the badge of his [[livery]].

[[Embroidery]] in wool, and silk or gold thread for the rich were used for decoration. [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] established an embroidery workshop in the [[Tower of London]], which presumably produced the robes he and his Queen wore in 1351 of red velvet \"embroidered with clouds of silver and eagles of pearl and gold, under each alternate cloud an eagle of pearl, and under each of the other clouds a golden eagle, every eagle having in its beak a Garter with the motto ''[[Order of the Garter|hony soyt qui mal y pense]]'' embroidered thereon.\"<ref>Donald King in Jonathan Alexander & Paul Binski (eds), op cit, p 160</ref>\n\n[[Silk]] was the finest fabric of all.

However, the trend during the century was for hem-lengths to shorten for all classes.\n\nHowever, in the second half of the century, courtiers are often shown, if they have the figure for it, wearing nothing over their closely tailored cotehardie.  A French [[chronicle]] records: \"Around that year (1350), men, in particular, noblemen and their squires, took to wearing tunics so short and tight that they revealed what modesty bids us hide.  This was a most astonishing thing for the people\".<ref>Continuation of a chronicle of [[Guillaume de Nangis]], Archives Nationales, Paris.  Quoted in: Fernand Braudel, ''Civilization and Capitalism, 15th-18th Centuries, Vol 1: The Structures of Everyday Life,\" p. 317, William Collins & Sons, London 1981</ref>\nThis fashion may well have derived from military clothing, where long loose robes were naturally not worn in action. At this period, the most dignified figures, like King Charles in the illustration, continue to wear long robes\u2014although as the Royal Chamberlain, de Vaudetar was himself a person of very high rank.  This abandonment of the robe to emphasize a tight top over the torso, with breeches or trousers below, was to become the distinctive feature of European men's fashion for centuries to come. Men had carried purses up to this time because tunics did not provide pockets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ashevillelist.com/history/medieval-clothing.htm |title=Medieval Clothing Facts and information - Medieval clothing history, fashions |publisher=Ashevillelist.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-12}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:BookoftheduchessIIIcchaucer.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chaucer]] reading his work to the court of Richard II, c. 1400]]\nThe funeral effigy and \"achievements\" of [[Edward, the Black Prince]] in [[Canterbury Cathedral]], who died in 1376, show the military version of the same outline.  Over [[Plate armour|armour]] he is shown wearing a short fitted ''arming-coat'' or ''jupon'' or ''gipon'', the original of which was hung above and still survives. This has the quartered arms of England and France, with a rather similar effect to a parti-coloured jacket.  The \"charges\" (figures) of the arms are embroidered in gold on linen pieces, [[appliqu\u00e9]]d onto coloured silk velvet fields.  It is vertically quilted, with wool stuffing and a silk satin lining.  This type of coat, originally worn out of sight under armour, was in fashion as an outer garment from about 1360 until early the next century.  Only this and a child's version (Chartres Cathedral) survive.<ref>[[Claude Blair]] in Jonathan Alexander & Paul Binski (eds), ''Age of Chivalry, Art in Plantagenet England, 1200\u20131400'', Royal Academy/Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London 1987, p 480.[http://www.forest.gen.nz/Medieval/articles/garments/blackprince/blackprince.html The effigy and arming-coat of the Black Prince]</ref>  As an indication of the rapid spread of fashion between the courts of Europe, a manuscript chronicle illuminated in Hungary by 1360 shows very [[Chronicon Pictum|similar styles]] to Edward's English version.\n\nEdward's son, King [[Richard II of England]], led a court that, like many in Europe late in the century, was extremely refined and fashion-conscious.  He himself is credited with having invented the [[handkerchief]]; \"little pieces [of cloth] for the lord King to wipe and clean his nose,\" appear in the Household Rolls (accounts), which is the first documentation of their use.  He distributed jeweled [[livery]] badges with his personal emblem of the white [[Deer|hart]] (deer) to his friends, like the one he himself wears in the [[Wilton Diptych]] (above).  In the miniature (left) of Chaucer reading to his court both men and women wear very high collars and quantities of jewelry.  The King (standing to the left of Chaucer; his face has been defaced) wears a patterned gold-coloured costume with matching hat.  Most of the men wear [[Chaperon (headgear)|chaperon]] hats, and the women have their hair elaborately dressed.  Male courtiers enjoyed wearing fancy-dress for festivities; the disastrous [[Charles VI of France#Bal des Ardents|Bal des Ardents]] in 1393 in Paris is the most famous example. Men, as well as women, wore decorated and jewelled clothes; for the entry of the [[Isabeau of Bavaria|Queen of France]] into Paris in 1389, the [[Philip II, Duke of Burgundy|Duke of Burgundy]] wore a velvet doublet embroidered with forty sheep and forty swans, each with a pearl bell around its neck.<ref>Barbara Tuchman;A Distant Mirror, 1978, Alfred A Knopf Ltd, p456, quoting Vaughan's biography of Philip.</ref>\n\nA new garment, the [[houppelande]], appeared around 1380 and was to remain fashionable well into the next century.<ref>Laver, ''Concise History of Costume and Fashion''</ref>  It was essentially a robe with fullness falling from the shoulders, very full trailing sleeves, and the high collar favored at the English court.  The extravagance of the sleeves was criticized by moralists.\n\n===Headgear and accessories===\n[[Image:20-alimenti vino rosso Taccuino Sanitatis Casanatense 4182 detail chaperon.jpg|thumb|Man wearing a chaperon, Italy, late 14th century]]\nDuring this century, the [[Chaperon (headgear)|chaperon]] made a transformation from being a utilitarian hood with a small cape to becoming a complicated and fashionable hat worn by the wealthy in town settings.  This came when they began to be worn with the opening for the face placed instead on the top of the head.\n\nBelts were worn below waist at all times, and very low on the hips with the tightly fitted fashions of the latter half of the century.  Belt pouches or purses were used, and long daggers, usually hanging diagonally to the front.\n\nIn armour, the century saw increases in the amount of [[plate armour]] worn, and by the end of the century the full suit had been developed, although mixtures of [[chain mail]] and plate remained more common.  The visored [[bascinet]] helmet was a new development in this century.  Ordinary soldiers were lucky to have a mail [[hauberk]], and perhaps some ''[[Boiled leather|cuir bouilli]]'' (\"boiled leather\") knee or shin pieces.<ref>Claude Blair, in Alexander & Binski, op cit pp 169\u201370</ref>\n\n===Style gallery===\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Braies 14th century.jpg|1 \u2013 Braies\nImage:3-piantagione Taccuino Sanitatis Casanatense 4182 shirt..jpg|2 \u2013 Shirt and braies\nImage:Luttrell servant.jpg|3 \u2013 Servant\nImage:Bologna marriage men.jpg|4 \u2013 Cotehardie and hood\nImage:Plaid cotehardie.jpg|5 \u2013 Cotehardie\nImage:37-svaghi cacciaTaccuino Sanitatis Casanatense 4182 cacciatore..jpg|6 \u2013 Huntsman\nImage:33-vento orientale Taccuino Sanitatis Casanatense 4182 detail..jpg|7 \u2013 Walking\nImage:46-aspetti di vita quotidiana discrezione Taccuino Sanitatis detail2..jpg|8 \u2013 Men's gowns\n</gallery>\n\n#[[:Image:Braies 14th century.jpg|Braies]] are worn rolled over a belt at the waist.

Many in the lower classes wore their undergarments to bed because of the cold weather at night time and since their beds usually consisted of a straw mattress and a few sheets, the undergarment would act as another layer.\n\n===Dresses and outerwear===\nOver the chemise, women wore a loose or fitted dress called a ''cotte'' or [[kirtle]], usually ankle or floor-length, and with [[train (clothing)|trains]] for formal occasions.  Fitted kirtles had wide skirts made by adding triangular gores to widen the hem without adding bulk at the waist.  Kirtles also had long, fitted sleeves that sometimes reached down to cover the knuckles.\n\nVarious sorts of robes were worn over the kirtle, and are called by different names by costume historians. When fitted, this garment is often called a [[cotehardie]] (although this usage of the word has been heavily criticized<ref>[http://www.cottesimple.com/ La Cotte Simple]</ref>) and might have hanging sleeves and sometimes worn with a jeweled or metalworked belt.  Over time, the hanging part of the sleeve became longer and narrower until it was the merest streamer, called a ''tippet'', then gaining the floral or leaflike daggings in the end of the century.<ref name=payne>Payne, Blanche: ''History of Costume from the Ancient Egyptians to the Twentieth Century'', Harper & Row, 1965</ref>\n\nSleeveless dresses or [[tabard]]s derive from the [[Cyclas (garment)|cyclas]], an unfitted rectangle of cloth with an opening for the head that was worn in the 13th century.  By the early 14th century, the sides began to be sewn together, creating a sleeveless overdress or surcoat.<ref name=payne/>\n\nOutdoors, women wore [[cloak]]s or [[mantle (clothing)|mantle]]s, often lined in fur.  The [[houppelande]] was also adopted by women late in the century.  Women invariably wore their houppelandes floor-length, the waistline rising up to right underneath the bust, sleeves very wide and hanging, like [[angel sleeves]].\n\n===Headdresses===\n\nAs one might imagine, a woman's outfit was not complete without some kind of headwear. As with today, a medieval woman had many options- from straw hats, to hoods to elaborate headpieces. A woman's activity and occasion would dictate what she wore on her head.\n\nThe Middle Ages, particularly the 14th and 15th centuries, were home to some of the most outstanding and gravity-defying headwear in history.\n\nBefore the [[hennin]] rocketed skywards, padded rolls and truncated and reticulated headdresses graced the heads of fashionable ladies everywhere in Europe and England. [[Caul (headgear)|Cauls]], the cylindrical cages worn at the side of the head and temples, added to the richness of dress of the fashionable and the well-to-do. Other more simple forms of headdress included the [[coronet]] or simple [[circlet]] of flowers.\n\n====Northern and western Europe====\nMarried women in Northern and Western Europe wore some type of headcovering.  The ''barbet'' was a band of linen that passed under the chin and was pinned on top of the head; it descended from the earlier [[wimple]] (in French, ''barbe''), which was now worn only by older women, widows, and [[nun]]s.  The barbet was worn with a linen [[Fillet (clothing)|fillet]] or headband, or with a linen cap called a [[coif]], with or without a ''couvrechef'' ([[kerchief]]) or [[Veil#History|veil]] overall.<ref>Laver, James: ''The Concise History of Costume and Fashion'', Abrams, 1979;</ref> It passed out of fashion by mid-century. Unmarried girls simply braided the hair to keep the dirt out.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Isabeau of Bavaria statue.jpg|thumb|A crespine worn by [[Isabeau of Bavaria]], Queen of France{{deletable image-caption|Monday, 26 November 2012}}]] -->\nThe barbet and fillet or barbet and veil could also be worn over the ''crespine'', a thick hairnet or [[snood (headgear)|snood]].  Over time, the crespine evolved into a mesh of jeweler's work that confined the hair on the sides of the head, and even later, at the back.  This metal crespine was also called a ''caul'', and remained stylish long after the barbet had fallen out of fashion.<ref>Payne, ''History of Costume''</ref> For example, it was used in [[Hungary]] until the beginning of the second half of the 15th century, as it was used by the Hungarian queen consort [[Barbara of Celje]] around 1440.\n\n====Italy====\nUncovered hair was acceptable for women in the Italian states.  Many women twisted their long hair with cords or ribbons and wrapped the twists around their heads, often without any cap or veil.  Hair was also worn braided.  Older women and widows wore a veil and wimple, and a simple knotted kerchief was worn while working. In the image at right, one woman wears a red hood draped over her twisted and bound hair.\n\n===Style gallery===\n<gallery>\nImage:Giotto joachim detail.jpg|1 \u2013 Italian gowns\nImage:Codex Manesse Ulrich von Singenberg detail.jpg|2 \u2013 Barbet and fillet\nImage:Luttrell women.jpg|3 \u2013 Women dining\nImage:Luttrell1 detail woman.jpg|4 \u2013 In a garden\nImage:Romance of alexander.jpg|5 \u2013 Hood\nImage:Ambrogio Lorenzetti 003.jpg|6 \u2013 Italian fashion\nImage:Bologna marriage women.jpg|7 \u2013 Bride and ladies\nImage:46-aspetti di vita quotidiana discrezione Taccuino Sanitatis detail..jpg|8 \u2013 Houppelande\nImage:El\u017cbieta \u0141okietk\u00f3wna z dzie\u0107mi.JPG|9 - Hungarian fashion ([[Elizabeth of Poland, Queen of Hungary]] and her children.

The countess wears a linen veil draped over her hair.]]\n'''Twelfth century European fashion''' was simple and differed only in details from the clothing of the [[Early medieval European dress|preceding centuries]].  Men wore knee-length [[tunics]] for most activities, and men of the upper classes wore long tunics, with [[hose (clothing)|hose]] and \n[[Mantle (clothing)|mantle]] or [[cloaks]].  Women wore long tunics or [[gowns|dresses]].  A close fit to the body, full [[skirts]], and long flaring [[sleeves]] were characteristic of upper-class fashion for both men and women.\n\n==General trends==\n[[Image:Moralia in Job MS dragonslayer detail.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Warrior wears a ''bliaut'' or form-fitting outer tunic with full skirts and wide sleeves over long blue hose. The garment worn underneath the bliaut has striped sleeves. His belt wraps around the waist and is knotted in front.]]\n\n===Overview===\nAs in the previous centuries, two styles of dress existed side-by-side for men: a short (knee-length) costume deriving from a melding of the everyday dress of the later [[Roman Empire]] and the short tunics worn by the [[Barbarian invasions|invading barbarians]], and a long (ankle-length) costume descended from the clothing of the Roman upper classes and influenced by [[Byzantine dress]].<ref name=\"Boucher\">Boucher, Fran\u00e7ois: ''20,000 Years of Fashion'', Harry Abrams, 1966, pp. 164\u2013172</ref>\n\n===Fabrics and furs===\n[[Wool]] remained the primary fabric for clothing of all classes, while [[linen]] undergarments, which were more comfortable against the skin and could be washed and then bleached in the sun, were increasingly worn.  Silk, although extremely expensive, was readily available to wealthy people of consequence. [[Silk]]s from [[Byzantium]] were traded in [[Pavia]] by way of [[Venice]], and silks from [[Andalusia]] reached [[France]] via [[Spain]].  In the last decade of the previous century, the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Norman conquest of Sicily]] and the [[First Crusade]] had opened additional routes for Eastern fabrics and style influences into Europe.<ref name=\"Boucher\" />\n\nFur was worn as an inside [[lining (sewing)|lining]] for warmth. [[Vair]], the fur of the squirrel, was particularly popular and can be seen in many [[illuminated manuscript]] illustrations, where it is shown as a white and blue-grey softly striped or checkered pattern lining the mantles of the wealthy.\n\n===The bliaut===\nA new French fashion for both men and women was the ''[[bliaut]]'' or ''bliaud'', a long outer tunic with full skirts from the hip and sleeves that fitted tightly to the elbow and then flared into a trumpet shape.  Early bliauts were moderately fitted and bloused slightly over the belt at the waist.  Later the bliaut was fitted tightly to the body from shoulder to hip, and the belt, or girdle was wrapped twice around the waist and knotted in front of the abdomen.<ref name=\"Boucher\" />\n\n==Men's clothing==\n[[Image:Hunterian Psalter c. 1170 Gemini.jpg|right|thumb|200px|\"Gemini\" from the ''[[Hunterian Psalter]]'' shows the twins in knee-length tunics over chausses and shoes with pointed toes.  England, c. 1170]]\n\n===Shirt, braies, and chausses===\nUnderclothes consisted of an inner tunic (French ''chainse'') or shirt with long, tight sleeves, and drawers or ''braies'', usually of linen. Tailored cloth [[leggings]] called ''chausses'' or [[Hose (clothing)|hose]], made as separate garments for each leg, were often worn with the tunic; striped hose were popular.<ref name=\"Boucher\" />\n\nDuring this period, beginning with the middle and upper classes, hose became longer and more fitting, and they reached above the knees. Previously, they were looser and worn with drawers that ranged from knee- to ankle-length. The new type of hose were worn with drawers that reached the knees or above, and they were wide enough at the top to allow the drawers to be tucked into them. They were held up in place by being attached to the girdle of the drawers.<ref name=\"multiref1\">Bradfield, 19.</ref>\n\nThe better fit and girdle attachment of these new hose eliminated the need for the leg bands often worn with earlier hose. In England, however, leg bands continued to be worn by some people, both rich and poor, right up to the reign of [[Richard I]].<ref>Bradfield, 23.</ref> After 1200, they were largely abandoned.<ref>Bradfield, 27.</ref>\n\n===Outer tunics and doublets===\nOver the undertunic and hose, men wore an outer tunic that reached to the knees or ankles, and that was fastened at the waist with a belt.  Fitted bliauts, of wool or, increasingly, silk, had sleeves that were cut wide at the wrist and gored skirts.  Men wore bliauts open to the waist front and back or at the side seams.<ref name=\"Boucher\" /><ref name=\"Payne\" />\n\nNewly fashionable were short, fitted garments for the upper body, worn under the tunic: the [[doublet (clothing)|doublet]], made of two layers of linen, and an early form of quilted and padded ''jupe'' or ''gipon''.<ref name=\"Boucher\" />\n\nThe sleeveless [[surcoat]] or ''cyclas'' was introduced during this period as protective covering for armour (especially against the sun) during the [[Crusades]].<ref>\"Dress and Adornment\", 489.</ref> By the [[1200\u20131300 in fashion|next century]], it would become widely adopted as civilian dress.<ref name=\"Payne\" />\n\nRectangular and circular cloaks were worn over the tunic.<ref name=\"Boucher\" />  These fastened on the right shoulder or at the center front.\n\n===Headgear===\nMen of the upper classes often went hatless.  The [[Chaperon (headgear)|chaperon]] in the form of hood and attached shoulder-length cape was worn during this period, especially by the rural lower classes, and the fitted linen [[coif]] tied under the chin appeared very late in the century. Small round or slightly conical caps with rolled brims were worn, and straw hats were worn for outdoor work in summer.<ref name=\"multiref1\" /><ref name=\"Payne\" />\n{{clear}}\n\n===Style gallery===\n<gallery>\nImage:Hortus Deliciarum - Antichrist.jpg|1 \u2013 Tunics\nImage:Richard coeurdelion g.jpg|2 \u2013 Richard I of England\nImage:Hunterian Psalter c. 1170 feasting.jpg|3 \u2013 Feasting\nImage:Geoffrey of Anjou Monument.jpg|4 \u2013 Geoffrey of Anjou\n</gallery>\n#[[:Image:Hortus Deliciarum - Antichrist.jpg|Illustration]] of the [[Anti-christ]] shows long and short tunics and hose or leggings.

The Emperor and the countess wear robes and mantles trimmed with bands of gold embroidery. The countess wears a linen veil draped over her hair.]]\n'''Twelfth century European fashion''' was simple and differed only in details from the clothing of the [[Early medieval European dress|preceding centuries]].  Men wore knee-length [[tunics]] for most activities, and men of the upper classes wore long tunics, with [[hose (clothing)|hose]] and \n[[Mantle (clothing)|mantle]] or [[cloaks]].  Women wore long tunics or [[gowns|dresses]].  A close fit to the body, full [[skirts]], and long flaring [[sleeves]] were characteristic of upper-class fashion for both men and women.\n\n==General trends==\n[[Image:Moralia in Job MS dragonslayer detail.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Warrior wears a ''bliaut'' or form-fitting outer tunic with full skirts and wide sleeves over long blue hose. The garment worn underneath the bliaut has striped sleeves. His belt wraps around the waist and is knotted in front.]]\n\n===Overview===\nAs in the previous centuries, two styles of dress existed side-by-side for men: a short (knee-length) costume deriving from a melding of the everyday dress of the later [[Roman Empire]] and the short tunics worn by the [[Barbarian invasions|invading barbarians]], and a long (ankle-length) costume descended from the clothing of the Roman upper classes and influenced by [[Byzantine dress]].<ref name=\"Boucher\">Boucher, Fran\u00e7ois: ''20,000 Years of Fashion'', Harry Abrams, 1966, pp. 164\u2013172</ref>\n\n===Fabrics and furs===\n[[Wool]] remained the primary fabric for clothing of all classes, while [[linen]] undergarments, which were more comfortable against the skin and could be washed and then bleached in the sun, were increasingly worn.  Silk, although extremely expensive, was readily available to wealthy people of consequence. [[Silk]]s from [[Byzantium]] were traded in [[Pavia]] by way of [[Venice]], and silks from [[Andalusia]] reached [[France]] via [[Spain]].  In the last decade of the previous century, the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Norman conquest of Sicily]] and the [[First Crusade]] had opened additional routes for Eastern fabrics and style influences into Europe.<ref name=\"Boucher\" />\n\nFur was worn as an inside [[lining (sewing)|lining]] for warmth. [[Vair]], the fur of the squirrel, was particularly popular and can be seen in many [[illuminated manuscript]] illustrations, where it is shown as a white and blue-grey softly striped or checkered pattern lining the mantles of the wealthy.\n\n===The bliaut===\nA new French fashion for both men and women was the ''[[bliaut]]'' or ''bliaud'', a long outer tunic with full skirts from the hip and sleeves that fitted tightly to the elbow and then flared into a trumpet shape.  Early bliauts were moderately fitted and bloused slightly over the belt at the waist.  Later the bliaut was fitted tightly to the body from shoulder to hip, and the belt, or girdle was wrapped twice around the waist and knotted in front of the abdomen.<ref name=\"Boucher\" />\n\n==Men's clothing==\n[[Image:Hunterian Psalter c. 1170 Gemini.jpg|right|thumb|200px|\"Gemini\" from the ''[[Hunterian Psalter]]'' shows the twins in knee-length tunics over chausses and shoes with pointed toes.  England, c. 1170]]\n\n===Shirt, braies, and chausses===\nUnderclothes consisted of an inner tunic (French ''chainse'') or shirt with long, tight sleeves, and drawers or ''braies'', usually of linen. Tailored cloth [[leggings]] called ''chausses'' or [[Hose (clothing)|hose]], made as separate garments for each leg, were often worn with the tunic; striped hose were popular.<ref name=\"Boucher\" />\n\nDuring this period, beginning with the middle and upper classes, hose became longer and more fitting, and they reached above the knees. Previously, they were looser and worn with drawers that ranged from knee- to ankle-length. The new type of hose were worn with drawers that reached the knees or above, and they were wide enough at the top to allow the drawers to be tucked into them. They were held up in place by being attached to the girdle of the drawers.<ref name=\"multiref1\">Bradfield, 19.</ref>\n\nThe better fit and girdle attachment of these new hose eliminated the need for the leg bands often worn with earlier hose. In England, however, leg bands continued to be worn by some people, both rich and poor, right up to the reign of [[Richard I]].<ref>Bradfield, 23.</ref> After 1200, they were largely abandoned.<ref>Bradfield, 27.</ref>\n\n===Outer tunics and doublets===\nOver the undertunic and hose, men wore an outer tunic that reached to the knees or ankles, and that was fastened at the waist with a belt.  Fitted bliauts, of wool or, increasingly, silk, had sleeves that were cut wide at the wrist and gored skirts.  Men wore bliauts open to the waist front and back or at the side seams.<ref name=\"Boucher\" /><ref name=\"Payne\" />\n\nNewly fashionable were short, fitted garments for the upper body, worn under the tunic: the [[doublet (clothing)|doublet]], made of two layers of linen, and an early form of quilted and padded ''jupe'' or ''gipon''.<ref name=\"Boucher\" />\n\nThe sleeveless [[surcoat]] or ''cyclas'' was introduced during this period as protective covering for armour (especially against the sun) during the [[Crusades]].<ref>\"Dress and Adornment\", 489.</ref> By the [[1200\u20131300 in fashion|next century]], it would become widely adopted as civilian dress.<ref name=\"Payne\" />\n\nRectangular and circular cloaks were worn over the tunic.<ref name=\"Boucher\" />  These fastened on the right shoulder or at the center front.\n\n===Headgear===\nMen of the upper classes often went hatless.  The [[Chaperon (headgear)|chaperon]] in the form of hood and attached shoulder-length cape was worn during this period, especially by the rural lower classes, and the fitted linen [[coif]] tied under the chin appeared very late in the century. Small round or slightly conical caps with rolled brims were worn, and straw hats were worn for outdoor work in summer.<ref name=\"multiref1\" /><ref name=\"Payne\" />\n{{clear}}\n\n===Style gallery===\n<gallery>\nImage:Hortus Deliciarum - Antichrist.jpg|1 \u2013 Tunics\nImage:Richard coeurdelion g.jpg|2 \u2013 Richard I of England\nImage:Hunterian Psalter c. 1170 feasting.jpg|3 \u2013 Feasting\nImage:Geoffrey of Anjou Monument.jpg|4 \u2013 Geoffrey of Anjou\n</gallery>\n#[[:Image:Hortus Deliciarum - Antichrist.jpg|Illustration]] of the [[Anti-christ]] shows long and short tunics and hose or leggings.

The [[bliaut]] had a flaring skirt and sleeves tight to the elbow and then widening to wrist in a trumpet shape.  A bliaut apparently cut in one piece from neckline to hem depicted on a column figure of a woman at the Cathedral of St. Maurice at [[Angers]] has visible side-lacing and is belted at the natural waistline.<ref name=\"Snyder\" />  A new fashion, the ''bliaut giron\u00e9'', arose in mid-century: this dress is cut in two pieces, a fitted upper portion with a finely [[pleat]]ed skirt attached to a low waistband.<ref name=\"Snyder\" />\n\nThe fitted bliaut was sometimes worn with a long belt or cincture (in French, ''ceinture'') that looped around a slightly raised waist and was knotted over the abdomen; the cincture could have decorative [[tassel]]s or metal tags at the ends.<ref name=\"Snyder\" />\n\nIn England, the fashionable dress was wide at the wrist but without the trumpet-shaped flare from the elbow seen in France.<ref name=\"Payne\" />\n\n===Hairstyles and headdresses===\nMarried women, in keeping with Christian custom, wore veils over their hair, which was often parted in the center and hung down in long braids that might be extended with false hair or purchased hair from the dead, a habit decried by moralists.<ref name=\"Snyder\" />\n\nDuring the Middle Ages hair was charged with cultural meaning.

Women wore [[linen]] headdresses or [[wimple]]s and veils, c. 1250]]\n'''Costume during the thirteenth century''' in Europe was very simple for both men and women, and quite uniform across the continent.  Male and female clothing were relatively similar, and changed very slowly, if at all.  Most clothing, especially outside the wealthier classes, remained little changed from three or four centuries earlier.<ref>Fran\u00e7oise Piponnier and Perrine Mane; Dress in the Middle Ages; p. 39; Yale UP, 1997; {{ISBN|0-300-06906-5}}</ref>  The century saw great progress in the dyeing and working of wool, which was by far the most important material for outerwear.  For the rich, colour and rare fabrics such as silk from the [[Bombyx mori|silkworm]] was very important.  Blue was introduced and became very fashionable, being adopted by the [[Kings of France]] as their heraldic colour.<ref>Piponnier & Mane, op cit, p. 60</ref>\n\n==Men's clothing==\nMen wore a [[tunic]], ''cote'' or ''cotte'' with a [[surcoat]] over a linen [[shirt]]. One of these surcoats was the cyclas, which began as a rectangular piece of cloth with a hole in it for the head. Over time the sides were sewn together to make a long, sleeveless tunic. When sleeves and sometimes a hood were added, the cyclas became a ganache (a cap-sleeved surcoat, usually shown with hood of matching color) or a gardcorps (a long, generous-sleeved traveling robe, somewhat resembling a modern academic robe). A [[Mantle (clothing)|mantle]] was worn as a formal wrap. Men also wore hose, [[shoes]], and headdress. The clothing of [[royal family|royalty]] was set apart by its rich fabric and luxurious furs. Hair and beard were moderate in length, and men generally wore their hair in a \"[[pageboy]]\" style, curling under at necklength. Shoes were slightly pointed, and embroidered for royalty and higher [[clergy]].<ref name=\"Payne\">Payne, Blanche: ''History of Costume from the Ancient Egyptians to the Twentieth Century'', Harper & Row, 1965</ref>\n\n===Working men's clothing===\nWorking men wore a short coat, or [[tunic]], with a belt. It was slit up the center of the front so that they could tuck the corners into their belt to create more freedom of movement. They wore long [[braies]] or leggings with legs of varying length, often visible as they worked with their cotte tucked into their belt.  Hose could be worn over this, attached to the drawstring or belt at the waist. Hats included a round cap with a slight brim, the [[beret]] (just like modern French ones, complete with a little tab at the top), the [[coif]] (a little tight white hood with strings that tied under the chin), the straw hat (in widespread use among farmworkers), and the [[chaperon (headgear)|chaperon]], then still a hood that came round the neck and over the shoulders.  Apart from aprons for trades like smithing, and crude clothes tied round the neck to hold seed for sowing, special clothes were not worn for working.<ref>Piponnier and Mane, op cit pp. 49\u201352</ref>\n\n===Style gallery===\n<gallery>\nImage:Braies.jpg|1 \u2013 Work clothes\nImage:Man in shirt and coif.jpg|2 \u2013 Shirt\nFile:Falconry Book of Frederick II 1240s detail falconers.jpg|3 - Tunics\nImage:Cotton Claudius B VII f.224 Merlin Vortigern.jpg|4 \u2013 Tunics and mantles\nImage:Maciejowski Bible cappa.png|5 \u2013 ''Cappa'' or ''[[Chaperon (headgear)|chaperon]]''\nFile:Symphonia Cantigas Sta Mar\u00eda 160.jpg|6 - Tunics\nFile:CantigasDeSantaMariaPanPipes.jpg|7 - Tunics with hanging sleeves\n\n</gallery>\n#[[:Image:Braies.jpg|Men working]] in linen braies, tunics, and coifs, from the [[Maciejowski Bible]], c. 1250.

Sketch by [[Villard de Honnecourt]], c.1230]]\n\n===Overview===\nDress for women was modest and restrained, and a narrow [[belt (clothing)|belt]] was uniform. Over it was worn the 'cyclas' or sleeveless [[surcoat]] also worn by men. More wealthy women wore more [[embroidery]] and their [[Mantle (clothing)|mantle]], held in place by a cord across the chest, might be lined with fur. Women, like men, wore hose and leather shoes.<ref name=\"Payne\" />\n\n===Headdresses and hairstyles===\nIndividuality in women's costume was expressed through their hair and headdress. One distinctive feature of women's headwear was the [[Barbette (headdress)|barbette]], a chin band to which a hat or various other headdresses might be attached. This hat might be a \"woman's coif\", which more nearly resembled a [[pillbox hat]], severely plain or fluted. The hair was often confined by a net called a [[crespine]] or [[crespinette]], visible only at the back. Later in the century the barbette and coif were reduced to narrow strips of cloth, and the entire hairdress might be covered with the crespine, the hair fashionable bulky over the ears. Coif and barbettes were white, while the crespine might be colored or gold. The [[wimple]] and [[veil]] of the [[1100-1200 in fashion|12th century]] still seen on [[nuns]] today was still worn, mainly by older women and [[widow]]s.<ref name=\"Payne\" />\nWomen also wore long tunics that went down to their ankles. This was worn over a shirt.\n\n===Wealthier Women's Jewelry===\nWealthy women often wore clothes lined with fur. They wore jewelry and jewels such to make them look rich and wealthy. However, rings and brooches were not worn as gemstone cutting was only invented in the 15th century.\n\n===Style gallery===\n<gallery>\nImage:Maciejowski Bible Woman.jpg|1 \u2013 From the [[Morgan Bible]], c. 1250: [[Wife of Manoah|the wife]] of [[Manoah]] wears a [[veil]] and [[wimple]]. Note striped hose.\n</gallery>\n\n==Sumptuary laws==\nThe [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] of 1215 ruled that Jews and Muslims must be distinguishable by their dress, beginning the process that transformed the conical or pointed [[Jewish hat]] from something worn as a voluntary mark of difference to an enforced one. Previously it had been worn but had been regarded by European Jews as \"an element of traditional garb, rather than an imposed discrimination\".<ref>Fran\u00e7oise Piponnier and Perrine Mane; ''Dress in the Middle Ages''; p. 138, Yale UP, 1997; {{ISBN|0-300-06906-5}}. Seals from Norman Roth, op cit. Also Schreckenburg p. 15 & passim.</ref>  A law in [[Breslau]] in 1267 said that since Jews had stopped wearing the pointed hats they used to wear, this would be made compulsory.<ref>[http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history_community/Medieval/MedievalSocialTO/Clothing/JewishHat.htm Medieval Jewish History: An Encyclopedia.

Over time these tended to be reduced to distinctive bands of fabric attached to the arm or shoulder, or tassels on the arm.<ref>Piponnier and Mane:139\u2013141</ref>\n\nThese probably reflected both a growing concern for control over the increasing urban populations, and the increasing effectiveness of the Church's control over social issues across the continent.\n\n==Footwear==\nShoes began to develop a pointed toe at this time however, they were much more restrained than they were in the 14th century. The usual shoe for men opened at the front, from the instep to the toe. Commoners also wore stockings with leather sewn to the sole, and wooden clogs. Woollen garters were also worn by commoners.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hughes|first=Talbot|title=Dress design: An Account of Costume for Artists & Dressmakers|year=1920|publisher=PITMAN & SONS|location=LONDON|pages=80\u201382|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/34903/34903-h/34903-h.htm#III_TENTH_FIFTEENTH_MALE}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:13th century shoes.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Shoes with an ankle strap and open instep, c. 1250]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{commons category|13th-century fashion}}\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Further reading===\n*Black, J.

Women wore [[linen]] headdresses or [[wimple]]s and veils, c. 1250]]\n'''Costume during the thirteenth century''' in Europe was very simple for both men and women, and quite uniform across the continent.  Male and female clothing were relatively similar, and changed very slowly, if at all.  Most clothing, especially outside the wealthier classes, remained little changed from three or four centuries earlier.<ref>Fran\u00e7oise Piponnier and Perrine Mane; Dress in the Middle Ages; p. 39; Yale UP, 1997; {{ISBN|0-300-06906-5}}</ref>  The century saw great progress in the dyeing and working of wool, which was by far the most important material for outerwear.  For the rich, colour and rare fabrics such as silk from the [[Bombyx mori|silkworm]] was very important.  Blue was introduced and became very fashionable, being adopted by the [[Kings of France]] as their heraldic colour.<ref>Piponnier & Mane, op cit, p. 60</ref>\n\n==Men's clothing==\nMen wore a [[tunic]], ''cote'' or ''cotte'' with a [[surcoat]] over a linen [[shirt]]. One of these surcoats was the cyclas, which began as a rectangular piece of cloth with a hole in it for the head. Over time the sides were sewn together to make a long, sleeveless tunic. When sleeves and sometimes a hood were added, the cyclas became a ganache (a cap-sleeved surcoat, usually shown with hood of matching color) or a gardcorps (a long, generous-sleeved traveling robe, somewhat resembling a modern academic robe). A [[Mantle (clothing)|mantle]] was worn as a formal wrap. Men also wore hose, [[shoes]], and headdress. The clothing of [[royal family|royalty]] was set apart by its rich fabric and luxurious furs. Hair and beard were moderate in length, and men generally wore their hair in a \"[[pageboy]]\" style, curling under at necklength. Shoes were slightly pointed, and embroidered for royalty and higher [[clergy]].<ref name=\"Payne\">Payne, Blanche: ''History of Costume from the Ancient Egyptians to the Twentieth Century'', Harper & Row, 1965</ref>\n\n===Working men's clothing===\nWorking men wore a short coat, or [[tunic]], with a belt. It was slit up the center of the front so that they could tuck the corners into their belt to create more freedom of movement. They wore long [[braies]] or leggings with legs of varying length, often visible as they worked with their cotte tucked into their belt.  Hose could be worn over this, attached to the drawstring or belt at the waist. Hats included a round cap with a slight brim, the [[beret]] (just like modern French ones, complete with a little tab at the top), the [[coif]] (a little tight white hood with strings that tied under the chin), the straw hat (in widespread use among farmworkers), and the [[chaperon (headgear)|chaperon]], then still a hood that came round the neck and over the shoulders.  Apart from aprons for trades like smithing, and crude clothes tied round the neck to hold seed for sowing, special clothes were not worn for working.<ref>Piponnier and Mane, op cit pp. 49\u201352</ref>\n\n===Style gallery===\n<gallery>\nImage:Braies.jpg|1 \u2013 Work clothes\nImage:Man in shirt and coif.jpg|2 \u2013 Shirt\nFile:Falconry Book of Frederick II 1240s detail falconers.jpg|3 - Tunics\nImage:Cotton Claudius B VII f.224 Merlin Vortigern.jpg|4 \u2013 Tunics and mantles\nImage:Maciejowski Bible cappa.png|5 \u2013 ''Cappa'' or ''[[Chaperon (headgear)|chaperon]]''\nFile:Symphonia Cantigas Sta Mar\u00eda 160.jpg|6 - Tunics\nFile:CantigasDeSantaMariaPanPipes.jpg|7 - Tunics with hanging sleeves\n\n</gallery>\n#[[:Image:Braies.jpg|Men working]] in linen braies, tunics, and coifs, from the [[Maciejowski Bible]], c. 1250.

Sketch by [[Villard de Honnecourt]], c.1230]]\n\n===Overview===\nDress for women was modest and restrained, and a narrow [[belt (clothing)|belt]] was uniform. Over it was worn the 'cyclas' or sleeveless [[surcoat]] also worn by men. More wealthy women wore more [[embroidery]] and their [[Mantle (clothing)|mantle]], held in place by a cord across the chest, might be lined with fur. Women, like men, wore hose and leather shoes.<ref name=\"Payne\" />\n\n===Headdresses and hairstyles===\nIndividuality in women's costume was expressed through their hair and headdress. One distinctive feature of women's headwear was the [[Barbette (headdress)|barbette]], a chin band to which a hat or various other headdresses might be attached. This hat might be a \"woman's coif\", which more nearly resembled a [[pillbox hat]], severely plain or fluted. The hair was often confined by a net called a [[crespine]] or [[crespinette]], visible only at the back. Later in the century the barbette and coif were reduced to narrow strips of cloth, and the entire hairdress might be covered with the crespine, the hair fashionable bulky over the ears. Coif and barbettes were white, while the crespine might be colored or gold. The [[wimple]] and [[veil]] of the [[1100-1200 in fashion|12th century]] still seen on [[nuns]] today was still worn, mainly by older women and [[widow]]s.<ref name=\"Payne\" />\nWomen also wore long tunics that went down to their ankles. This was worn over a shirt.\n\n===Wealthier Women's Jewelry===\nWealthy women often wore clothes lined with fur. They wore jewelry and jewels such to make them look rich and wealthy. However, rings and brooches were not worn as gemstone cutting was only invented in the 15th century.\n\n===Style gallery===\n<gallery>\nImage:Maciejowski Bible Woman.jpg|1 \u2013 From the [[Morgan Bible]], c. 1250: [[Wife of Manoah|the wife]] of [[Manoah]] wears a [[veil]] and [[wimple]]. Note striped hose.\n</gallery>\n\n==Sumptuary laws==\nThe [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] of 1215 ruled that Jews and Muslims must be distinguishable by their dress, beginning the process that transformed the conical or pointed [[Jewish hat]] from something worn as a voluntary mark of difference to an enforced one. Previously it had been worn but had been regarded by European Jews as \"an element of traditional garb, rather than an imposed discrimination\".<ref>Fran\u00e7oise Piponnier and Perrine Mane; ''Dress in the Middle Ages''; p. 138, Yale UP, 1997; {{ISBN|0-300-06906-5}}. Seals from Norman Roth, op cit. Also Schreckenburg p. 15 & passim.</ref>  A law in [[Breslau]] in 1267 said that since Jews had stopped wearing the pointed hats they used to wear, this would be made compulsory.<ref>[http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history_community/Medieval/MedievalSocialTO/Clothing/JewishHat.htm Medieval Jewish History: An Encyclopedia. Edited by Norman Roth, Routledge] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225013546/http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history_community/Medieval/MedievalSocialTO/Clothing/JewishHat.htm |date=2008-02-25 }}</ref>  The [[Yellow badge]] also dates from this century, although the hat seems to have been much more widely worn.\n\n[[Sumptuary law]]s covering prostitutes were introduced (following Ancient Roman precedent) in the 13th century: in [[Marseilles]] a striped cloak, in England a striped hood, and so on.  Over time these tended to be reduced to distinctive bands of fabric attached to the arm or shoulder, or tassels on the arm.<ref>Piponnier and Mane:139\u2013141</ref>\n\nThese probably reflected both a growing concern for control over the increasing urban populations, and the increasing effectiveness of the Church's control over social issues across the continent.\n\n==Footwear==\nShoes began to develop a pointed toe at this time however, they were much more restrained than they were in the 14th century. The usual shoe for men opened at the front, from the instep to the toe. Commoners also wore stockings with leather sewn to the sole, and wooden clogs. Woollen garters were also worn by commoners.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hughes|first=Talbot|title=Dress design: An Account of Costume for Artists & Dressmakers|year=1920|publisher=PITMAN & SONS|location=LONDON|pages=80\u201382|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/34903/34903-h/34903-h.htm#III_TENTH_FIFTEENTH_MALE}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:13th century shoes.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Shoes with an ankle strap and open instep, c. 1250]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{commons category|13th-century fashion}}\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Further reading===\n*Black, J.
