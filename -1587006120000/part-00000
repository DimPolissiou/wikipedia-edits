Mickey neglects his wife, Janice, who once had been a \"Miss Luxemberg\" in a successful ad campaign featuring various attractive models.\n\nJanice has just discovered she is expecting a baby, but is unable to inform Mickey, who is too distracted by work. Even when they find time to go to a movie, [[John Wayne]] is on screen, being considerate to his screen wife ([[Angie Dickinson]]), which makes Janice weepy but Mickey finds unrealistic.\n\nIt does give Mickey an idea, however, for a campaign in which \"Miss Luxemberg\" is now \"Mrs. Luxemberg\", enjoying family bliss. Sutton loves it, then rejects all the applicants until he decides that Janice herself must return to be \"Mrs. Luxemberg\".

After the brief [[Kingdom of Tungning]] in parts of the southern and western areas of the island, the island [[Taiwan under Qing rule|was annexed in 1683]] by the [[Qing dynasty]] of China, and [[Treaty of Shimonoseki|ceded]] to the [[Empire of Japan]] in 1895.

[[List of islands of Taiwan|Smaller islands]] include a number in the Taiwan Strait including the [[Penghu]] archipelago, the [[Kinmen]] and [[Matsu Islands]] near the Chinese coast, and some of the [[South China Sea Islands]].\n\nThe main island is a tilted [[fault block]], characterized by the contrast between the eastern two-thirds, consisting mostly of five rugged mountain ranges parallel to the east coast, and the flat to gently rolling plains of the western third, where the majority of Taiwan's population reside. There are several peaks over 3,500&nbsp;m, the highest being [[Yu Shan]] at {{cvt|3952|m|ft}}, making Taiwan the world's [[List of islands by highest point|fourth-highest island]]. The tectonic boundary that formed these ranges is still active, and the island experiences many earthquakes, a few of them highly destructive.

The upper part of the crust on the island is primarily made up of a series of [[terrane]]s, mostly old [[island arc]]s which have been forced together by the collision of the forerunners of the [[Eurasian Plate]] and the [[Philippine Sea Plate]].

This process of amendment continues. In 2000, the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) won the [[President of the Republic of China|presidency]], ending KMT's continuous control of the government. In May 2005, a new National Assembly was elected to reduce the number of parliamentary seats and implement several constitutional reforms. These reforms have been passed; the National Assembly has essentially voted to abolish itself and transfer the power of constitutional reform to the popular ballot.<ref>{{cite news|title=Taiwan assembly passes changes |date=7 June 2005 |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4616043.stm}}</ref>\n[[File:Presidential Building, Taiwan (0747).JPG|thumb|Taiwan's popularly elected president resides in the [[Presidential Office Building, Taipei]], originally built in the Japanese era for colonial governors.]]\nThe [[head of state]] and commander-in-chief of the [[Republic of China Armed Forces|armed forces]] is the [[President of the Republic of China|president]], who is elected by popular vote for a maximum of 2 four-year terms on the same ticket as the vice-president.

The shared cultural origin combined with several hundred years of geographical separation, some hundred years of political separation and foreign influences, as well as hostility between the rival ROC and PRC have resulted in national identity being a contentious issue with political overtones. Since democratic reforms and the lifting of martial law, a distinct Taiwanese identity (as opposed to Taiwanese identity as a subset of a Chinese identity) is often at the heart of political debates. Its acceptance makes the island distinct from mainland China, and therefore may be seen as a step towards forming a consensus for ''de jure'' Taiwan independence.<ref name=\"power-shift\">{{Cite book|last=Shambaugh|first=David L.|title=Power shift|publisher=University of California Press|year=2006|pages=179\u2013183 |isbn=978-0-520-24570-9}}</ref> The [[pan-green]] camp supports a distinct Taiwanese identity, while the [[pan-blue]] camp supports a Chinese identity only.<ref name=\"panblue-reunif-chineseid\" /> The KMT has downplayed this stance in the recent years and now supports a Taiwanese identity as part of a Chinese identity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/eo20081230ho.html|title=No sign of a 'peace agreement'|last=Okazaki|first=Hisahiko|date=30 December 2008|newspaper=Japan Times|accessdate=15 July 2009|quote=For one thing, I believe there is recognition that the awareness of Taiwanese identity is now irreversible.

Local governments are responsible or partially responsible for social services, education, urban planning, public construction, water management, environmental protection, transport and public safety.\n\nThere are three types of subnational divisions: special municipalities, cities and counties. Special municipalities and cities are further divided into districts for local administration. Counties are further divided into townships and county-administered cities which have government offices with elected leaders and local councils, which share responsibilities with the county. Some divisions are indigenous divisions which have different degrees of autonomy to standard ones.

It was later reformed into the Republic of China Army. Units which surrendered and remained in mainland China were either disbanded or incorporated into the People's Liberation Army.\n\nToday, Taiwan maintains a large and technologically advanced military, mainly as a defence to the constant threat of invasion by the [[People's Liberation Army]] using the [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China]] as a pretext.

In recent years, the concept of Taiwanese [[multiculturalism]] has been proposed as a relatively apolitical alternative view, which has allowed for the inclusion of mainlanders and other minority groups into the continuing re-definition of Taiwanese culture as collectively held systems of meaning and customary patterns of thought and behaviour shared by the people of Taiwan.<ref>{{harvnb|Hsiau|2005|pp=125\u2013129}}; {{harvnb|Winckler|1994|pp=23\u201341}}</ref> [[Identity politics]], along with the over one hundred years of political separation from mainland China, has led to distinct traditions in many areas, including [[Taiwanese cuisine|cuisine]] and [[Music of Taiwan|music]].\n\n[[File:2008TIBE Day1 Hall1 Opening TouhWang.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Wang Tuoh]], a Taiwanese writer, literary critic and politician]]\nOne of Taiwan's greatest attractions is the [[National Palace Museum]], which houses more than 650,000 pieces of Chinese bronze, jade, calligraphy, painting, and porcelain and is considered one of the greatest collections of Chinese art and objects in the world.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761557357_9/Museum.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028163715/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761557357_9/Museum.html|title=Museum|archivedate=28 October 2009|work=archive.org}}</ref> The KMT moved this collection from the [[Forbidden City]] in Beijing in 1933 and part of the collection was eventually transported to Taiwan during the Chinese Civil War.

[[Karaoke]], drawn from contemporary Japanese culture, is extremely popular in Taiwan, where it is known as KTV. KTV businesses operate in a hotel-like style, renting out small rooms and ballrooms according to the number of guests in a group. Many KTV establishments partner with restaurants and buffets to form all-encompassing and elaborate evening affairs for families, friends, or businessmen. Tour buses that travel around Taiwan have several TV's, equipped not for watching movies, but primarily for singing Karaoke. The entertainment counterpart of a KTV is an MTV, being found much less frequently out of the city. There, movies out on DVD can be selected and played in a private theatre room. However, MTV, more so than KTV, has a growing reputation for being a place that young couples will go to be alone and intimate.\n\nTaiwan has a high density of 24-hour convenience stores, which, in addition to the usual services, provide services on behalf of financial institutions or government agencies such as collection of parking fees, utility bills, traffic violation fines, and credit card payments.<ref>{{cite journal|author=American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei |authorlink=American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei |title=Convenience Stores Aim at Differentiation |journal=Taiwan Business Topics |volume=34 |issue=11 |url=http://www.amcham.com.tw/publication_topics_view.php?volume=34&vol_num=11&topics_id=558 |format=\u2013 <sup>[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=intitle%3AConvenience+Stores+Aim+at+Differentiation&as_publication=Taiwan+Business+TOPICS&as_ylo=&as_yhi=&btnG=Search Scholar search]</sup> |ref=harv |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516161020/http://www.amcham.com.tw/publication_topics_view.php?volume=34&vol_num=11&topics_id=558 |archivedate=16 May 2008 }}</ref> They also provide a service for mailing packages.\n\nTaiwanese culture has also influenced other cultures.

After the brief [[Kingdom of Tungning]] in parts of the southern and western areas of the island, the island [[Taiwan under Qing rule|was annexed in 1683]] by the [[Qing dynasty]] of China, and [[Treaty of Shimonoseki|ceded]] to the [[Empire of Japan]] in 1895.

As early as 1636, a Dutch missionary referred to this group as Taiouwang. From the name of the tribe, the Portuguese called the area around Ping'an as Tayowan, Taiyowan, Tyovon, Teijoan, Toyouan, and so forth.

[[List of islands of Taiwan|Smaller islands]] include a number in the Taiwan Strait including the [[Penghu]] archipelago, the [[Kinmen]] and [[Matsu Islands]] near the Chinese coast, and some of the [[South China Sea Islands]].\n\nThe main island is a tilted [[fault block]], characterized by the contrast between the eastern two-thirds, consisting mostly of five rugged mountain ranges parallel to the east coast, and the flat to gently rolling plains of the western third, where the majority of Taiwan's population reside. There are several peaks over 3,500&nbsp;m, the highest being [[Yu Shan]] at {{cvt|3952|m|ft}}, making Taiwan the world's [[List of islands by highest point|fourth-highest island]]. The tectonic boundary that formed these ranges is still active, and the island experiences many earthquakes, a few of them highly destructive.

The upper part of the crust on the island is primarily made up of a series of [[terrane]]s, mostly old [[island arc]]s which have been forced together by the collision of the forerunners of the [[Eurasian Plate]] and the [[Philippine Sea Plate]].

This process of amendment continues. In 2000, the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) won the [[President of the Republic of China|presidency]], ending KMT's continuous control of the government. In May 2005, a new National Assembly was elected to reduce the number of parliamentary seats and implement several constitutional reforms. These reforms have been passed; the National Assembly has essentially voted to abolish itself and transfer the power of constitutional reform to the popular ballot.<ref>{{cite news|title=Taiwan assembly passes changes |date=7 June 2005 |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4616043.stm}}</ref>\n[[File:Presidential Building, Taiwan (0747).JPG|thumb|Taiwan's popularly elected president resides in the [[Presidential Office Building, Taipei]], originally built in the Japanese era for colonial governors.]]\nThe [[head of state]] and commander-in-chief of the [[Republic of China Armed Forces|armed forces]] is the [[President of the Republic of China|president]], who is elected by popular vote for a maximum of 2 four-year terms on the same ticket as the vice-president.

The shared cultural origin combined with several hundred years of geographical separation, some hundred years of political separation and foreign influences, as well as hostility between the rival ROC and PRC have resulted in national identity being a contentious issue with political overtones. Since democratic reforms and the lifting of martial law, a distinct Taiwanese identity (as opposed to Taiwanese identity as a subset of a Chinese identity) is often at the heart of political debates. Its acceptance makes the island distinct from mainland China, and therefore may be seen as a step towards forming a consensus for ''de jure'' Taiwan independence.<ref name=\"power-shift\">{{Cite book|last=Shambaugh|first=David L.|title=Power shift|publisher=University of California Press|year=2006|pages=179\u2013183 |isbn=978-0-520-24570-9}}</ref> The [[pan-green]] camp supports a distinct Taiwanese identity, while the [[pan-blue]] camp supports a Chinese identity only.<ref name=\"panblue-reunif-chineseid\" /> The KMT has downplayed this stance in the recent years and now supports a Taiwanese identity as part of a Chinese identity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/eo20081230ho.html|title=No sign of a 'peace agreement'|last=Okazaki|first=Hisahiko|date=30 December 2008|newspaper=Japan Times|accessdate=15 July 2009|quote=For one thing, I believe there is recognition that the awareness of Taiwanese identity is now irreversible.

Local governments are responsible or partially responsible for social services, education, urban planning, public construction, water management, environmental protection, transport and public safety.\n\nThere are three types of subnational divisions: special municipalities, cities and counties. Special municipalities and cities are further divided into districts for local administration. Counties are further divided into townships and county-administered cities which have government offices with elected leaders and local councils, which share responsibilities with the county. Some divisions are indigenous divisions which have different degrees of autonomy to standard ones.

It was later reformed into the Republic of China Army. Units which surrendered and remained in mainland China were either disbanded or incorporated into the People's Liberation Army.\n\nToday, Taiwan maintains a large and technologically advanced military, mainly as a defence to the constant threat of invasion by the [[People's Liberation Army]] using the [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China]] as a pretext.

In recent years, the concept of Taiwanese [[multiculturalism]] has been proposed as a relatively apolitical alternative view, which has allowed for the inclusion of mainlanders and other minority groups into the continuing re-definition of Taiwanese culture as collectively held systems of meaning and customary patterns of thought and behaviour shared by the people of Taiwan.<ref>{{harvnb|Hsiau|2005|pp=125\u2013129}}; {{harvnb|Winckler|1994|pp=23\u201341}}</ref> [[Identity politics]], along with the over one hundred years of political separation from mainland China, has led to distinct traditions in many areas, including [[Taiwanese cuisine|cuisine]] and [[Music of Taiwan|music]].\n\n[[File:2008TIBE Day1 Hall1 Opening TouhWang.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Wang Tuoh]], a Taiwanese writer, literary critic and politician]]\nOne of Taiwan's greatest attractions is the [[National Palace Museum]], which houses more than 650,000 pieces of Chinese bronze, jade, calligraphy, painting, and porcelain and is considered one of the greatest collections of Chinese art and objects in the world.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761557357_9/Museum.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028163715/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761557357_9/Museum.html|title=Museum|archivedate=28 October 2009|work=archive.org}}</ref> The KMT moved this collection from the [[Forbidden City]] in Beijing in 1933 and part of the collection was eventually transported to Taiwan during the Chinese Civil War.

[[Karaoke]], drawn from contemporary Japanese culture, is extremely popular in Taiwan, where it is known as KTV. KTV businesses operate in a hotel-like style, renting out small rooms and ballrooms according to the number of guests in a group. Many KTV establishments partner with restaurants and buffets to form all-encompassing and elaborate evening affairs for families, friends, or businessmen. Tour buses that travel around Taiwan have several TV's, equipped not for watching movies, but primarily for singing Karaoke. The entertainment counterpart of a KTV is an MTV, being found much less frequently out of the city. There, movies out on DVD can be selected and played in a private theatre room. However, MTV, more so than KTV, has a growing reputation for being a place that young couples will go to be alone and intimate.\n\nTaiwan has a high density of 24-hour convenience stores, which, in addition to the usual services, provide services on behalf of financial institutions or government agencies such as collection of parking fees, utility bills, traffic violation fines, and credit card payments.<ref>{{cite journal|author=American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei |authorlink=American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei |title=Convenience Stores Aim at Differentiation |journal=Taiwan Business Topics |volume=34 |issue=11 |url=http://www.amcham.com.tw/publication_topics_view.php?volume=34&vol_num=11&topics_id=558 |format=\u2013 <sup>[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=intitle%3AConvenience+Stores+Aim+at+Differentiation&as_publication=Taiwan+Business+TOPICS&as_ylo=&as_yhi=&btnG=Search Scholar search]</sup> |ref=harv |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516161020/http://www.amcham.com.tw/publication_topics_view.php?volume=34&vol_num=11&topics_id=558 |archivedate=16 May 2008 }}</ref> They also provide a service for mailing packages.\n\nTaiwanese culture has also influenced other cultures.

{"title_page": "Suplex", "text_new": "{{short description|Wrestling maneuver}}\n{{More citations needed|date=January 2007}}\n\nA '''suplex''' is an [[Offense (sports)|offensive]] move used in  [[professional wrestling]]. It is a throw that involves lifting the opponent and [[Bridge (grappling)|bridging]] or rolling to slam the opponent on their back.\n\nProfessional wrestling features many different varieties of suplexes. The following are among the most common, but many more exist, particularly as the signature techniques of individual wrestlers.\n\n==Front facelock variants==\nIn these suplexes, the wrestlers begin by facing each other, the attacking wrestler then applies a [[Professional wrestling holds#Front facelock|front facelock]] to the opponent before executing a throw. In most cases, the opponent is suspended upside-down during part of the move. The most common front facelock suplex is the [[#Vertical suplex|vertical suplex]].\n\n===Fisherman suplex{{anchor|Fisherman's suplex}}===\nAlso known as a fisherman's suplex and also known as a leg hook suplex. With their opponent in a [[professional wrestling holds#Front facelock|front facelock]] with the near arm draped over the attacker's shoulder, the wrestler hooks the opponent's near leg behind the opponent's knee with their free arm and falls backwards, flipping the opponent onto their back. In most cases the attacking wrestler will keep the leg hooked and bridge to pin the opponent in a cradle-like position, as in the case of [[Curt Hennig]] and [[Curtis Axel|Joe Hennig]]'s ''Perfect-plex''.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/classics/classic-lists/the-50-coolest-maneuvers-of-all-time/page-45|title=the 50 coolest maneuvers of all time - Perfect-plex|date=2014-02-21|accessdate=2014-05-04|publisher=WWE}}</ref> Other times the wrestler will apply a [[Professional wrestling holds#Leg locks|leglock submission hold]] to the hooked leg.\n\n====Swinging fisherman suplex====\nMore commonly referred to as swinging fisherman neckbreaker. A swinging variation of the standard fisherman suplex, this move sees a wrestler, with their opponent in a front facelock with the near arm draped over their shoulder, hook the opponent's near leg with their free arm and roll over to the same side of the arm being used to hook the opponent's leg, flipping the opponent over onto their back.\n\n===Hammerlock suplex===\nIn this variation of the suplex, the attacker applies a [[Professional wrestling holds#Hammerlock|hammerlock]] on his opponent before applying a front facelock and positioning the opponent's free arm over the attacker's head. The attacker then lifts up the opponent and falls backwards, dropping the opponent down back first, landing with their trapped arm bent behind their back.\n\n===Slingshot suplex===\nThe attacker faces a standing opponent with one side of the ring immediately behind the opponent. The attacker applies a front facelock to the opponent, takes hold of the opponent with their free hand, then lifts the opponent until he/she is nearly vertical. The attacker then falls forward so that the torso of the opponent bounces off the top ring rope, and uses this momentum to quickly lift the opponent overhead once more and falls backwards, driving the back and shoulders of the opponent into the ground.\n\n===Suplex slam===\nThis move is similar to most suplexes and starts with the attacker applying a front face lock to their opponent and draping the opponent's near arm over their shoulder, then lifting him/her up and holding the opponent in the vertical position. This is where the move differs from most of its counterparts with the attacker not falling with the opponent, but rather shifting themselves slightly and throwing their opponent to the mat on his back. Sometimes this involves the wrestler turning the opponent in midair and slamming the opponent down to the mat ''in front'' of him/her onto their back, similar to a high-angled [[Professional wrestling throws#Body slam|body slam]]. The suplex slam can also be used for other suplexes such as the [[Suplex#Fisherman suplex|fisherman suplex]] or [[Suplex#Gutwrench suplex|gutwrench suplex]].\n\nThere is also a sitout version. Also called a suplex [[Professional wrestling throws#Driver|driver]], this sees an attacker apply a [[professional wrestling holds#Front facelock|front facelock]] to the opponent and drapes the opponent's near arm over their shoulder. The attacker then takes hold of the opponent's torso with their free arm and lifts the opponent to a vertical position. The facelock is loosened so the opponent can be twisted slightly, then the attacker falls to a sitting position and the victim's back and shoulders are driven into the mat. The opponent lands between the attacker's legs with their head toward them.\n\nAnother variation sees the wrestler perform a [[#Vertical suplex|vertical suplex]], but instead of twisting the upside down opponent to face them, the wrestler turns 180\u00b0 to face the opponent before sitting down and driving them back first between their legs.\n\n====Reverse suplex slam{{anchor|Inverted suplex slam|Front suplex|Gourdbuster}}====\nAlso called a front suplex or a gourdbuster, this move sees the attacker apply a front face lock to the opponent and drape the opponent's near arm over their shoulder. The attacker then lifts the opponent into a vertical position, then he falls or kneels forward, driving the opponents face into the ground. A standing version also exists. It was invented by [[Arn Anderson]]\n\nIn the sitout version, the attacker applies a front face lock to the opponent and drapes the opponent's near arm over their shoulder. The attacker then lifts the opponent into a vertical position, and falls into a sit-out position, driving the face of the opponent into the ground. In another variation, the wrestler releases the hold just prior to the sitout position letting his opponents own momentum to force them down head first.\n\n===Superplex===\n[[File:Cesaro superplex.jpg|thumb|[[Cesaro (wrestler)|Cesaro]] performing a superplex on [[Jack Swagger]]]]\nA superplex (a portmanteau of \"[[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Super|super]]\" and \"suplex\") refers to any suplex performed by an attacker standing on the second or third rope against an opponent sitting on the top rope or top turnbuckle. The most common suplex used for this top rope move is the standard [[#Vertical suplex|vertical suplex]] variation (known as the suicide-plex), in which the attackers apply a front face lock to the opponent, draping the opponent's near arm over their respective shoulders, at this point the wrestler falls backwards and flips the opponent over them so they both land on their backs.\n\n===Tornado suplex===\nIn a set-up similar to a [[DDT (professional wrestling)#Tornado DDT|tornado DDT]], a wrestler goes to the top rope and applies a front facelock on their opponent from an elevated position, draping the opponent's near arm over their shoulder. The wrestler then jumps forward and swings around, but lands on their feet and performs a suplex on their opponent.\n\n===Vertical suplex===\n[[File:Ryze suplex on Hooker.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A wrestler performing a vertical suplex on an opponent]]In a set-up similar to a snap suplex, the attacking wrestler applies a front face lock to the opponent, draping the opponent's near arm over their shoulder, when the opponent is in position they are lifted to an upside-down position before the attacking wrestler falls backwards slamming the opponent's back into the mat.\n\nThe delayed variation of a vertical suplex, also known as the hanging suplex, standing suplex or stalling suplex, sees the attacking wrestler holds an opponent in the upside-down position at the peak of the arc for several seconds before completing the maneuver, thereby (in [[kayfabe]]) causing blood to pool into the head of the opponent. This move is a staple of larger and powerful wrestlers as it gives an aura of dominance over their opponents who can do nothing but wait to drop in the suplex.\n\nThe rotating variation of a vertical suplex, also sometimes known as the rotation suplex, rotary suplex, or twisting suplex, sees the attacking wrestler lift the opponent as in a normal vertical suplex, but turn around as he or she falls back to twist the opponent into the mat.\n\n====Drop suplex====\nThis variation of a [[#Vertical suplex|vertical suplex]] sees the attacking wrestler lift the opponent as in a normal vertical suplex, but then simply drop them flat to the mat instead of falling backwards with them. The move was first popularized in WCW by [[Kevin Nash]], who began to use it instead of a standard suplex to avoid aggravating a back injury.\n\n====Rolling release suplex====\nThis variation of a [[#Vertical suplex|vertical suplex]], also known as the ''[[EZ Money#In wrestling|Crash Landing]]'', sees the attacker lift his opponent up with the standard suplex lift but instead of falling backwards and having the opponent drop down onto his shoulders and back, the attacker turns the opponent and releases them from the [[Professional wrestling holds#Front facelock|front facelock]] at the apex of the lift. Both the attacker and the opponent fall forward, with the opponent landing on his neck, shoulders and back.\n\n====Rolling non-release suplex====\nAlso known as triple rolling verticals, or triple rolling vertical suplexes, this variation of a [[#Vertical suplex|vertical suplex]] sees the attacking wrestler perform a single vertical or [[#Snap suplex|snap]] suplex to the opponent, but the attacking wrestler doesn't release the hold, instead rolling his legs and body into a standing position to execute a second suplex, then repeats the process for a third suplex. This was popularized by [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] Hall of Famer [[Eduardo Gory Guerrero Llanes|Eddie Guerrero]] used this move calling it the ''Three Amigos''. Many other WWE superstars used this move to pay tribute to him such as  [[Chavo Guerrero Jr.|Chavo]] and [[Tyler Black|Seth Rollins]].\n\n====Running suplex====\nThis variation is similar to a classic suplex including the attacking wrestlers begins with a standard [[Professional wrestling holds#Front facelock|front facelock]] and then when he starts lifting opponent, he makes a few running steps forward while continue the suplex rotation, slamming the opponent back-first onto the mat.\n\n====Snap suplex====\n[[File:Brie Bella Suplex.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Brie Bella]] setting up a snap suplex on [[Aksana (wrestler)|Aksana]] at [[WrestleMania XXX]]]]\nThis move sees the attacker apply a front face lock to their opponent, draping the opponent's near arm over their shoulder, the attacker stomps down hard and suplexes the opponent stiffly, resulting in a quicker throw.\n\n===Toss suplex===\nThis variation of [[#Vertical suplex|vertical suplex]] sees the attacking wrestler lift the opponent as in a normal vertical suplex, but then simply toss them across the mat instead of falling backwards with them.\n\n=== Jumping suplex ===\nInstead of just falling down onto his/her own back, the attacking wrestler jumps up and uses his momentum to drive the opponent down to the mat back first.\n\n===Underhook suplex{{anchor|Half hatch suplex|Half-hatch suplex}}===\nAlso known as a half-hatch suplex. It is performed in similar fashion to a [[Suplex#Snap suplex|snap suplex]]. The wrestler applies a [[Professional wrestling holds#Front facelock|front facelock]] with one arm but instead of draping the arm over their shoulders as seen in most suplexes, the attacker [[underhook]]s one of the opponent's arms with their other, placing their hand palm down on the back of the opponent. The wrestler then lifts the opponent up while bridging backwards, bringing the opponent overhead and onto their back. This can be performed with or without a pinning combination in which the wrestler bridges their back and legs to hold the opponent's shoulders against the mat. It can also be done with a kick for an added snap effect.\n\n==Belly-to-back variants==\nIn these variants, the attacker stands behind his opponent and applies a hold before falling backwards, dropping the opponent on his or her upper back. The most common belly-to-back variants are the [[#German suplex|German suplex]] and the [[#Belly-to-back suplex|back suplex]].\n\n===Belly-to-back suplex{{anchor|Belly to back suplex|Back suplex}}===\n[[File:Pepper Parks belly-to-back suplex.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|[[Pepper Parks]] (bottom) performing a belly-to-back suplex on RJ City.]]\nFor the belly-to-back suplex, the wrestler stands behind his opponent and puts his head under the arm of the opponent. The wrestler then lifts the opponent up grabbing the waist and thigh of the opponent, so the opponent is on the attacker's shoulder. The attacker finally falls backwards, dropping the opponent flat on his back.<ref name=toa>[http://www.otherarena.com/nCo/finish/finish.html Finishing move list, from TheOtherArena.com]</ref><ref name=bbowm>[http://www.deathvalleydriver.com/bbbowm/part1.htm Big Book of Wrestling Moves, from DeathValleyDriver.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506000024/http://www.deathvalleydriver.com/bbbowm/part1.htm |date=2013-05-06 }}</ref>\n\nSome wrestlers perform the back suplex into a bridging position, simultaneously arching their own back and legs to elevate themselves, gaining leverage and [[Pinfall (professional wrestling)|pinning]] their opponent. Very popular in [[Mexico]]'s [[Lucha Libre]], where this bridging version is known as a '''Puente Griego''' or Greek Bridge in [[English language|English]]. In 2018, the Colombian referee [[Wilmar Roldan]] announced a campaign to introduce this variant of the suplex to international soccer.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=\nSpostamento di wrestling da introdurre nel calcio internazionale? |trans-title=Wrestling move to be introduced to international soccer? |newspaper=Gazzetta Dello Sport|location=Milan |date=2018-01-22}}</ref>\n\nSince the wrestler taking the move is falling backwards, the potential for injury is significant if it is not performed properly. Japanese wrestler [[Mitsuharu Misawa]] suffered a spinal injury which triggered a fatal cardiac arrest during his last match in 2009 after [[Akitoshi Saito]] gave him the belly to back suplex.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.f4wonline.com/content/view/9617/|title=Misawa Passes Away After Backdrop In Hiroshima Match|publisher=Wrestling Observer/Figure Four Online|date=2009-06-13|accessdate=2009-08-08}}</ref><ref name=\"Slam\">{{Cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2009/06/13/9788666.html|title=Japanese legend Mitsuharu Misawa dies in the ring|author=Schramm, Chris|work=Slam! Wrestling|publisher=Canadian Online Explorer|date=2009-06-13|accessdate=2009-06-13}}</ref>\n\n====High-angle belly-to-back suplex====\nAlso known as a backdrop driver, the attacking wrestler stands behind his opponent and puts his head under the arm of the opponent. He then lifts the opponent up using both of his arms wrapped around the torso of the opponent. The attacker finally falls backwards to drive the opponent to the mat on their neck and shoulders.\n\n====Leg hook belly-to-back suplex====\nSometimes referred to as a leg lift back suplex or leg lift backdrop, it is applied just as a back suplex would be, except that the wrestler wraps only the near arm or no arm around the torso of their opponent. With the free arm(s), the wrestler then hoists their opponent's knees or thighs and throws them backwards in that manner.\n\n====Cobra clutch suplex====\nThe attacker places the opponent in a [[professional wrestling holds#Cobra clutch|cobra clutch hold]]. They then proceed to lift the opponent up and fall backwards, driving the opponent to the mat on their head.\n\n====Crossface chickenwing suplex====\nThe wrestler stands behind the opponent. He locks one of the opponent's arms in a [[Professional wrestling holds#Chickenwing|chickenwing]], and [[professional wrestling holds#Crossface|wraps his other arm around the opponent's head]]. He then lifts the opponent up and falls backwards, driving the opponent on to the top of their head, down to the mat.\n\n====Crotch clutch suplex====\nThis move involves the attacking wrestler approaching an opponent from behind, reaching down and grasping his crotch with both forearms, with hands together and facing upwards into his groin, and lifting him overhead into a belly-to-back release suplex. The opponent reacts to both the suplex and being grabbed and lifted by his crotch, to humorous effect. The move was popularized by [[Joey Ryan (wrestler)|Joey Ryan]], who dubs it the \"[[YouPorn]] Plex\".<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-sports/youporn-signs-joey-ryan-wrestlings-king-of-dong-style-40940/|title=YouPorn Signs Joey Ryan, Wrestling\u2019s 'King of Dong Style'|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|first=James|last=Montgomery|date=December 18, 2015|accessdate=January 26, 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Dragon suplex{{anchor|Full nelson suplex}}====\nThis belly-to-back suplex variation sees the wrestler apply a [[nelson hold#Full nelson|full nelson]] and then bridge his back, lifting the opponent over him and onto their shoulders down to the mat. The wrestler keeps his back arched and the hold applied, [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinning]] the opponent's shoulders down to the mat. The wrestler may also release the opponent mid-arch, throwing them down to the mat shoulders and neck first, in a variation known as release dragon suplex.\n\n====Electric chair suplex====\nAlso known as an [[Professional wrestling throws#Electric chair drop|electric chair slam]]. The wrestler lifts the opponent on their shoulders in an [[Professional wrestling holds#Electric chair|electric chair]] sitting position and then bridges his back, slamming the opponent down to the mat shoulder and upper back first.\n\n====German suplex====\nThe wrestler stands behind the opponent, grabs them around their waist, lifts them up, and falls backwards while bridging his back and legs, slamming the opponent down to the mat shoulder and upper back first. The wrestler keeps the waistlock and continues bridging with their back and legs, pinning the opponent's shoulders down against the mat. The regular pinning variation can be referred to as the German suplex pin. The wrestler can also release the opponent in mid arch, which is referred to as a release German suplex. Sometimes, rather than bridging for a pin, the wrestler may roll himself into another position to perform the move again, often referred to as multiple, rolling, or non-release German suplexes, in which the attacking wrestler performs a German suplex, then rolls his legs to get back into a standing position, but does ''not'' let the opponent go to do so. The attacking wrestler then repeats this numerous times, most commonly three, but sometimes up to eight or more. The most common WWE superstar that uses the manoeuvre is [[Brock Lesnar]].\n\n====Straight jacket suplex{{anchor|X-Plex|X-plex}}====\n[[File:Adam Cole straightjacket german suplex.jpg|thumb|[[Adam Cole]] performing straight jacket suplex on [[Kevin Owens|Kevin Steen]]]]\nThe [[Professional wrestling holds#Straight jacket|straight jacket]] suplex or package German suplex has the attacker trapping the opponent's arms while performing a German suplex. Variants such as the cross-arm suplex or X-Plex see the opponent's arms crossed across their chest and held by the attacker. The wrestler then uses the crossed arms as leverage to aid in lifting the opponent up while falling backwards to throw the opponent as in a German suplex.\n\n====Half and half suplex====\nThis is a suplex variation in which the wrestler, while standing behind the opponent, places one arm in a [[nelson hold#Half nelson|half nelson]] and the other arm in a [[Professional wrestling holds#Chickenwing|chickenwing]]. The wrestler then proceeds to fall backwards while lifting the opponent overhead in the hold and driving them into the mat behind them. This move is referred to as a half and half suplex as it is a combination of a [[#Half nelson suplex|half nelson suplex]] and a [[#Tiger suplex|tiger suplex]]. The move can be either released or brought into a pin.\n\n====Half nelson suplex====\nThis is a version of a [[#German suplex|German suplex]] where the attacker stands behind the opponent, facing the same direction. The attacker uses one hand to apply a [[nelson hold#Half nelson|half nelson]] hold and wraps the other hand around the opponent's waist. The attacker then lifts the opponent up and falls backwards, dropping the opponent on their head, neck, or shoulders. The move can be either released or brought into a pin.\n\n====Pumphandle suplex====\nThe wrestler stands behind the opponent and bends him forward. One of the opponent's arms is pulled back between his legs and held, while the opponent's other arm is hooked by the attacker maneuvering his arm around in front of the opponent's shoulder (as in a [[professional wrestling holds#Pumphandle|pumphandle]]) and securing it behind the head (a [[nelson hold#Quarter nelson|quarter-nelson]]). The attacker then lifts his opponent up over his head and falls backwards to slam the opponent against the mat back-first.\n\nThere are many variations of the pumphandle suplex, including the maintaining of the grip in order to land the opponent on the mat face-first, or inverting the opponent's body position and securing the opponent's free arm using a [[nelson hold#Quarter nelson|half-nelson grip]] instead of the normal quarter-nelson.\n\n====Sleeper suplex====\nThe attacker places the opponent in a [[Professional wrestling holds#Sleeper hold|sleeper hold]] and then hooks one of the opponents arms with his free arm. The attacker then lifts the opponent up and falls backwards, driving the opponent on their head. A slight variation sees the attacker apply a [[kata ha jime|half nelson choke]] instead of the sleeper hold before performing the suplex.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/classics/classic-lists/the-50-coolest-maneuvers-of-all-time/page-16 |title=the 50 coolest maneuvers of all time|date=2014-02-21|accessdate=2014-03-13|publisher=WWE}}</ref>\n\n==== Katahajime suplex ====\nThe attacker stands behind the opponent, facing the same direction. The wrestler puts one arm in a half nelson and the other hand around the neck in front of the opponent, like in a sleeper. The hand in front of the neck is locked with the other hand at the wrist. With the grip secure, the attacker then lifts the opponent up and falls backwards, dropping the opponent on their head, neck, or shoulders. The move can end in a release or bridging position.\n\n'''Three-quarter nelson suplex'''\n\nThe attacker places their opponent in three-quarter nelson before lifting them and falling backwards, dropping them on their head or neck.\n\n====Tiger suplex {{anchor|Double chickenwing suplex}}====\n[[File:Tiger suplex by Tsukushi.JPG|thumb|220px|[[Tsukushi (wrestler)|Tsukushi]] performing a tiger suplex on [[Sendai Sachiko]].]]\nInnovated by [[Alfonso Dant\u00e9s]] and popularized by the original [[Tiger Mask (professional wrestling)|Tiger Mask]] ([[Satoru Sayama]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2008/07/30/6312326.html|title=Mexican great Alfonso Dant\u00e9s dies|author=Schramm, Chris|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=2010-02-21|date=July 31, 2008}}</ref> this move sees the wrestler standing behind their opponent, [[Professional wrestling holds#Double chickenwing|hooks both of the opponent's arms from the sides]], and places their hands palm down flat against the opponent's upper back. The wrestler then lifts the opponent up and falls backwards, arching their back and legs and then slamming the opponent down to the mat shoulder and neck first. Like other suplex variations, this move can either end in a bridging pin or be released upon execution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://headlockbackdrop.wordpress.com/2010/12/15/12-tiger-suplex/|title=Tiger suplex|accessdate=2013-06-06|publisher=Headlocks&Backdrops}}</ref>\n\n====Wheelbarrow suplex====\nThis move is performed when a wrestler wraps a forward-facing opponent's legs around their waist, in a [[Professional wrestling holds#Wheelbarrow|wheelbarrow hold]], from either standing behind an opponent who is laying face-first on the mat or by catching a charging opponent before then applying a waistlock to lift the opponent up off the ground into the air, then the attacking wrestler would continue lifting the opponent over their while falling backwards to hit belly-to-back suplex.\n\n==Belly-to-belly variants==\nIn these suplexes, the wrestlers begin by facing each other. The attacker then applies a bodylock before falling backwards and flipping the opponent onto his back and down on the mat.\n\n===Belly-to-belly suplex{{anchor|Belly to belly suplex}}===\n[[File:Bayley performing a Bayley-to-belly suplex on Alexa Bliss.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bayley (wrestler)|Bayley]] performs a Bayley-to-belly suplex (belly-to-belly suplex) on [[Alexa Bliss]]]]\nThe wrestler wraps their arms around the opponent in a waistlock or a bodylock position and flips them over by violently bridging their own body so the opponent lands on their back. This can be done either overhead or to the side. For a side belly-to-belly suplex, the attacker usually holds on to the opponent for the duration of the move, but for the overhead belly-to-belly suplex, the attacker usually executes an overhead throw and lets go of the opponent. It can also be performed in a \"snap\" fashion, where the attacker stomps down hard and suplexes the opponent stiffly, resulting in a quicker throw.\n\n====Capture suplex====\nThe attacker stands facing a standing opponent. The attacker then catches one leg of the opponent and pulls the opponent towards them so that they are face-to-face, with the attacker reaching under the opponent's leg and hooking it. The attacker then uses their free arm to reach behind the neck of the opponent and take hold of them. The attacker then quickly bridges backwards and releases the opponent, throwing them overhead, or turns 180\u00b0 while slamming the opponent down to the mat. This move can be used to counter a kick. The move is also known as the head and leg suplex, and can be seen as a variation of the head and arm suplex.\n\n====Double underhook suplex{{anchor|Double arm suplex|Butterfly suplex}}====\nAlso known as a double arm suplex, reverse nelson suplex, double axe handle suplex, and a butterfly suplex, the wrestler and opponent face each other, the opponent bent forward. The wrestler hooks the opponent's arms back in a [[Professional wrestling holds#Butterfly|reverse nelson]], placing his forearms in the crooks of the opponent's elbows, with his hands on top of the opponent's back in a butcher's grip. The wrestler then lifts the opponent into an upside-down vertical position and falls back, shifting the opponent to one side as the opponent flips over. The wrestler executing the suplex may release the reverse nelson hold during the throw, or can maintain the grip and attempt a bridging pin or submission hold transition upon impact.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wrestling.wonderhowto.com/how-to/do-butterfly-suplex-315172/|title=Double underhook suplex|accessdate=2013-06-06|publisher=WonderHowTo}}</ref>\n\n====Exploder suplex====\n[[File:Shelton Benjamin - T-Bone Suplex.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shelton Benjamin]] hits a variant of the T-Bone suplex, with a powerslam pin, on [[Carly Col\u00f3n|Carlito]].]]\nThe attacker stands facing his opponent and positions himself under one of the opponent's arms and wraps his arm around the opponent's neck and back (this position is similar to that of a [[Powerslam|side slam]]) and then grabs the leg of the opponent and tosses him backwards, over the attacker's head. Several other variations exist, such as the wrist-clutch exploder suplex (often called '''Exploder '98''') and the bridging exploder suplex (also called '''Blizzard Suplex''').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://headlockbackdrop.wordpress.com/2010/12/20/17-exploder-suplex/|title=Exploder suplex|accessdate=2013-06-06|publisher=Headlocks&Backdrops}}</ref>\n\n====Head-and-arm suplex====\nAlso called a gargoyle suplex, the move is a variation of the traditional overhead belly-to-belly suplex in which the wrestler, standing face-to-face with his opponent, clutches his hands together having firmly encircled the opponent's head and one arm.  This grip, as opposed to the waistlock of a normal belly-to-belly, is then used to hoist the opponent in the overhead arching throw.\n\n====Northern Lights suplex{{anchor|Northern lights suplex}}====\n[[File:Alicia Fox Northern lights suplex on Dana Brooke.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alicia Fox]] performs a Northern Lights suplex w/ bridge on [[Dana Brooke]]]]\nFounder\u3000: Hiroshi Hase(Japanese Minister).The attacking wrestler puts his head under the arm of the opponent, wraps his arms around the waist of the opponent and flips him/her backwards. This suplex can either be released or bridged into a pin. The wrestler can also float over into another Northern Lights suplex.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wrestling.wonderhowto.com/how-to/do-northern-lights-suplex-pro-wrestling-move-417507/|title=Northern Lights suplex|accessdate=2013-06-06|publisher=WonderHowTo}}</ref>\n\n====Table top suplex====\n{{see also|[[Professional wrestling throws#Fallaway slam|Fallaway slam]]}}\nAlso known as a fallaway slam, the wrestler lifts the opponent up so the opponent is horizontal across the wrestler's body then falls backward, throwing the opponent over their head down to the mat back-first. This slam can be either bridged into a pin, or the wrestler can float over into another fallaway slam. This move is sometimes used as a continuation move from catching the opponent's high-cross body, to emphasize the wrestler's strength.\n\n====Trapping suplex====\nThis is when a wrestler holds both the opponent's arms under his own (known as ''overhooks'' in mixed martial arts and amateur wrestling, as the arms loop under the opponent's arms from above) with the hands connected below the opponent's triceps, from here the opponent is left secure and unable to counter or move away from the attacker while he/she delivers a belly-to-belly throw flipping the opponent overhead in the normal belly-to-belly motion. In amateur wrestling and other contact-sports, the trapping suplex is called the suicide throw. It is done slightly differently, usually the opponent is tossed to the side and lands on their back.\n\nThis move consists of one wrestler picking up his or her opponent off the ground (or mat) and then using a large portion of his or her own body weight to drive the opponent down on the mat. He or she begins face-to-face, then the attacker forces the opponent's head down and locks the opponent's arm around it.\n\n==Side variants==\nIn the side variants the attacker stands to the side of his or her opponent and applies a hold before falling backwards to slam the opponent to the mat. The most common is the [[#Saito suplex|Saito suplex]].\n\n===Gutwrench suplex===\nThis throw involves a wrestler standing on one side of a prone opponent locking both arms around the opponent's waist [[Professional wrestling holds#Gutwrench|near arm in front of the opponent and far arm behind]], and lifting him/her up to slam him/her over back-first down to the mat. An inverted version also exists.\n\n===Saito suplex===\nThe attacker stands either facing directly one of their opponent's sides or slightly behind in an angle. He places the opponent's near arm over his shoulder, grabs a waistlock, and then lifts the opponent up while falling backwards, causing the opponent to land on their neck and shoulders.\n\n[[File:Allysin Kay Cut-Throat.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Allysin Kay]] performing a Leg-hook Saito suplex]]\nThere is also a leg-hook variation where the attacker stands behind and to one side of the opponent. The attacker wraps one arm around the waist of the opponent and grabs the back of the opponent's near leg with their other arm. The attacker then lifts the opponent on to their shoulder and then falls backwards, driving the opponent into the mat at a high angle.\n\n===Side suplex===\n:''See [[Powerslam#Uranage|Ura-nage]] or [[Professional wrestling throws#Russian legsweep|Russian legsweep]].''\nThis move is also known as a sambo suplex or side suplex. To perform it, the wrestler stands face-to-face with the opponent, slightly to their side. The wrestler either reaches across the opponent's chest and around their neck with their near arm and locks both hands behind the opponent's shoulders or just locks both hands behind the opponent's waist. The wrestler then simultaneously lifts the opponent up, twists 180\u00b0 and falls backwards, bringing the opponent over them and slamming the opponent back-first on the mat.\n\nThe name ura-nage (or uranage) comes from a Judo throw which translated directly from Japanese, means \"throw to behind/back\" and is commonly (albeit incorrectly) used to refer to a regular side slam in pro wrestling. The Judo ura-nage throw more closely resembles a saito suplex in execution.\n\n====Cravate suplex====\nThis sees a wrestler lock their opponent in a [[Professional wrestling holds#Three-quarter facelock|cravate]] and pull down with their arms so that the opponent is forced to bend over. The wrestler then positions the opponent so that they are facing across the body of the wrestler and with their head in front of the wrestlers chest while stil standing. The wrestler then falls backwards, pulling upwards with the cravate and forcing the opponent off their feet into the air and over the wrestler, landing on their neck and shoulders.\n\n==Inverted facelock variants==\nIn these suplexes, an attacker begins by facing the back of an opponent and applying an [[Professional wrestling holds#Inverted facelock|inverted facelock]] before executing a throw. In most, the opponent is suspended upside-down during part of the move.\n\n=inverse Suplex\nAlso known as a reverse suplex, this move sees the attacker stands behind an opponent and applies an inverted facelock with one arm, and uses the other arm to aid in elevating the opponent so that he/she is lifted up and held upside-down before the attacker falls to his back driving the opponent down to the mat face first, behind the attacker.\n\n==In other sports==\nSuplex tackles in [[gridiron football]] are not allowed and may be subject to penalties or even fines.<ref name=\"Moddejonge\">{{cite news|last1=Moddejonge|first1=Gerry|title=Back-to-back interceptions avoid CFL version of Montreal Screwjob|url=http://www.edmontonsun.com/2016/08/12/back-to-back-interceptions-avoid-cfl-version-of-montreal-screwjob|accessdate=13 August 2016|work=Edmonton Sun|date=13 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Professional wrestling throws]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20121028142636/http://www.deathvalleydriver.com/bbbowm/part3.htm \"Professional Wrestling Moves: Part 3\"] Death Valley Driver.com\n*''The Professional Wrestlers' Workout & Instructional Guide'' - [[Harley Race]], [[Ricky Steamboat]], [[Les Thatcher]], and [[Alex Marvez]] pg. 80-84\n{{Wrestling Moves}}\n\n[[Category:Wrestling]]\n[[Category:Professional wrestling moves]]\n\n[[de:Liste der Wrestling-Kampftechniken#Suplessen]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wrestling maneuver}}\n{{More citations needed|date=January 2007}}\n\nA '''suplex''' is an [[Offense (sports)|offensive]] move used in  [[professional wrestling]]. It is a throw that involves lifting the opponent and [[Bridge (grappling)|bridging]] or rolling to slam the opponent on their back.\n\nProfessional wrestling features many different varieties of suplexes. The following are among the most common, but many more exist, particularly as the signature techniques of individual wrestlers.\n\n==Front facelock variants==\nIn these suplexes, the wrestlers begin by facing each other, the attacking wrestler then applies a [[Professional wrestling holds#Front facelock|front facelock]] to the opponent before executing a throw. In most cases, the opponent is suspended upside-down during part of the move. The most common front facelock suplex is the [[#Vertical suplex|vertical suplex]].\n\n===Fisherman suplex{{anchor|Fisherman's suplex}}===\nAlso known as a fisherman's suplex and also known as a leg hook suplex. With their opponent in a [[professional wrestling holds#Front facelock|front facelock]] with the near arm draped over the attacker's shoulder, the wrestler hooks the opponent's near leg behind the opponent's knee with their free arm and falls backwards, flipping the opponent onto their back. In most cases the attacking wrestler will keep the leg hooked and bridge to pin the opponent in a cradle-like position, as in the case of [[Curt Hennig]] and [[Curtis Axel|Joe Hennig]]'s ''Perfect-plex''.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/classics/classic-lists/the-50-coolest-maneuvers-of-all-time/page-45|title=the 50 coolest maneuvers of all time - Perfect-plex|date=2014-02-21|accessdate=2014-05-04|publisher=WWE}}</ref> Other times the wrestler will apply a [[Professional wrestling holds#Leg locks|leglock submission hold]] to the hooked leg.\n\n====Swinging fisherman suplex====\nMore commonly referred to as swinging fisherman neckbreaker. A swinging variation of the standard fisherman suplex, this move sees a wrestler, with their opponent in a front facelock with the near arm draped over their shoulder, hook the opponent's near leg with their free arm and roll over to the same side of the arm being used to hook the opponent's leg, flipping the opponent over onto their back.\n\n===Hammerlock suplex===\nIn this variation of the suplex, the attacker applies a [[Professional wrestling holds#Hammerlock|hammerlock]] on his opponent before applying a front facelock and positioning the opponent's free arm over the attacker's head. The attacker then lifts up the opponent and falls backwards, dropping the opponent down back first, landing with their trapped arm bent behind their back.\n\n===Slingshot suplex===\nThe attacker faces a standing opponent with one side of the ring immediately behind the opponent. The attacker applies a front facelock to the opponent, takes hold of the opponent with their free hand, then lifts the opponent until he/she is nearly vertical. The attacker then falls forward so that the torso of the opponent bounces off the top ring rope, and uses this momentum to quickly lift the opponent overhead once more and falls backwards, driving the back and shoulders of the opponent into the ground.\n\n===Suplex slam===\nThis move is similar to most suplexes and starts with the attacker applying a front face lock to their opponent and draping the opponent's near arm over their shoulder, then lifting him/her up and holding the opponent in the vertical position. This is where the move differs from most of its counterparts with the attacker not falling with the opponent, but rather shifting themselves slightly and throwing their opponent to the mat on his back. Sometimes this involves the wrestler turning the opponent in midair and slamming the opponent down to the mat ''in front'' of him/her onto their back, similar to a high-angled [[Professional wrestling throws#Body slam|body slam]]. The suplex slam can also be used for other suplexes such as the [[Suplex#Fisherman suplex|fisherman suplex]] or [[Suplex#Gutwrench suplex|gutwrench suplex]].\n\nThere is also a sitout version. Also called a suplex [[Professional wrestling throws#Driver|driver]], this sees an attacker apply a [[professional wrestling holds#Front facelock|front facelock]] to the opponent and drapes the opponent's near arm over their shoulder. The attacker then takes hold of the opponent's torso with their free arm and lifts the opponent to a vertical position. The facelock is loosened so the opponent can be twisted slightly, then the attacker falls to a sitting position and the victim's back and shoulders are driven into the mat. The opponent lands between the attacker's legs with their head toward them.\n\nAnother variation sees the wrestler perform a [[#Vertical suplex|vertical suplex]], but instead of twisting the upside down opponent to face them, the wrestler turns 180\u00b0 to face the opponent before sitting down and driving them back first between their legs.\n\n====Reverse suplex slam{{anchor|Inverted suplex slam|Front suplex|Gourdbuster}}====\nAlso called a front suplex or a gourdbuster, this move sees the attacker apply a front face lock to the opponent and drape the opponent's near arm over their shoulder. The attacker then lifts the opponent into a vertical position, then he falls or kneels forward, driving the opponents face into the ground. A standing version also exists. It was invented by [[Arn Anderson]]\n\nIn the sitout version, the attacker applies a front face lock to the opponent and drapes the opponent's near arm over their shoulder. The attacker then lifts the opponent into a vertical position, and falls into a sit-out position, driving the face of the opponent into the ground. In another variation, the wrestler releases the hold just prior to the sitout position letting his opponents own momentum to force them down head first.\n\n===Superplex===\n[[File:Cesaro superplex.jpg|thumb|[[Cesaro (wrestler)|Cesaro]] performing a superplex on [[Jack Swagger]]]]\nA superplex (a portmanteau of \"[[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Super|super]]\" and \"suplex\") refers to any suplex performed by an attacker standing on the second or third rope against an opponent sitting on the top rope or top turnbuckle. The most common suplex used for this top rope move is the standard [[#Vertical suplex|vertical suplex]] variation (known as the suicide-plex), in which the attackers apply a front face lock to the opponent, draping the opponent's near arm over their respective shoulders, at this point the wrestler falls backwards and flips the opponent over them so they both land on their backs.\n\n===Tornado suplex===\nIn a set-up similar to a [[DDT (professional wrestling)#Tornado DDT|tornado DDT]], a wrestler goes to the top rope and applies a front facelock on their opponent from an elevated position, draping the opponent's near arm over their shoulder. The wrestler then jumps forward and swings around, but lands on their feet and performs a suplex on their opponent.\n\n===Vertical suplex===\n[[File:Ryze suplex on Hooker.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A wrestler performing a vertical suplex on an opponent]]In a set-up similar to a snap suplex, the attacking wrestler applies a front face lock to the opponent, draping the opponent's near arm over their shoulder, when the opponent is in position they are lifted to an upside-down position before the attacking wrestler falls backwards slamming the opponent's back into the mat.\n\nThe delayed variation of a vertical suplex, also known as the hanging suplex, standing suplex or stalling suplex, sees the attacking wrestler holds an opponent in the upside-down position at the peak of the arc for several seconds before completing the maneuver, thereby (in [[kayfabe]]) causing blood to pool into the head of the opponent. This move is a staple of larger and powerful wrestlers as it gives an aura of dominance over their opponents who can do nothing but wait to drop in the suplex.\n\nThe rotating variation of a vertical suplex, also sometimes known as the rotation suplex, rotary suplex, or twisting suplex, sees the attacking wrestler lift the opponent as in a normal vertical suplex, but turn around as he or she falls back to twist the opponent into the mat.\n\n====Drop suplex====\nThis variation of a [[#Vertical suplex|vertical suplex]] sees the attacking wrestler lift the opponent as in a normal vertical suplex, but then simply drop them flat to the mat instead of falling backwards with them. The move was first popularized in WCW by [[Kevin Nash]], who began to use it instead of a standard suplex to avoid aggravating a back injury.\n\n====Rolling release suplex====\nThis variation of a [[#Vertical suplex|vertical suplex]], also known as the ''[[EZ Money#In wrestling|Crash Landing]]'', sees the attacker lift his opponent up with the standard suplex lift but instead of falling backwards and having the opponent drop down onto his shoulders and back, the attacker turns the opponent and releases them from the [[Professional wrestling holds#Front facelock|front facelock]] at the apex of the lift. Both the attacker and the opponent fall forward, with the opponent landing on his neck, shoulders and back.\n\n====Rolling non-release suplex====\nAlso known as triple rolling verticals, or triple rolling vertical suplexes, this variation of a [[#Vertical suplex|vertical suplex]] sees the attacking wrestler perform a single vertical or [[#Snap suplex|snap]] suplex to the opponent, but the attacking wrestler doesn't release the hold, instead rolling his legs and body into a standing position to execute a second suplex, then repeats the process for a third suplex. This was popularized by [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] Hall of Famer [[Eduardo Gory Guerrero Llanes|Eddie Guerrero]] used this move calling it the ''Three Amigos''. Many other WWE superstars used this move to pay tribute to him such as  [[Chavo Guerrero Jr.|Chavo]] and [[Tyler Black|Seth Rollins]].\n\n====Running suplex====\nThis variation is similar to a classic suplex including the attacking wrestlers begins with a standard [[Professional wrestling holds#Front facelock|front facelock]] and then when he starts lifting opponent, he makes a few running steps forward while continue the suplex rotation, slamming the opponent back-first onto the mat.\n\n====Snap suplex====\n[[File:Brie Bella Suplex.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Brie Bella]] setting up a snap suplex on [[Aksana (wrestler)|Aksana]] at [[WrestleMania XXX]]]]\nThis move sees the attacker apply a front face lock to their opponent, draping the opponent's near arm over their shoulder, the attacker stomps down hard and suplexes the opponent stiffly, resulting in a quicker throw.\n\n===Toss suplex===\nThis variation of [[#Vertical suplex|vertical suplex]] sees the attacking wrestler lift the opponent as in a normal vertical suplex, but then simply toss them across the mat instead of falling backwards with them.\n\n=== Jumping suplex ===\nInstead of just falling down onto his/her own back, the attacking wrestler jumps up and uses his momentum to drive the opponent down to the mat back first.\n\n===Underhook suplex{{anchor|Half hatch suplex|Half-hatch suplex}}===\nAlso known as a half-hatch suplex. It is performed in similar fashion to a [[Suplex#Snap suplex|snap suplex]]. The wrestler applies a [[Professional wrestling holds#Front facelock|front facelock]] with one arm but instead of draping the arm over their shoulders as seen in most suplexes, the attacker [[underhook]]s one of the opponent's arms with their other, placing their hand palm down on the back of the opponent. The wrestler then lifts the opponent up while bridging backwards, bringing the opponent overhead and onto their back. This can be performed with or without a pinning combination in which the wrestler bridges their back and legs to hold the opponent's shoulders against the mat. It can also be done with a kick for an added snap effect.\n\n==Belly-to-back variants==\nIn these variants, the attacker stands behind his opponent and applies a hold before falling backwards, dropping the opponent on his or her upper back. The most common belly-to-back variants are the [[#German suplex|German suplex]] and the [[#Belly-to-back suplex|back suplex]].\n\n===Belly-to-back suplex{{anchor|Belly to back suplex|Back suplex}}===\n[[File:Pepper Parks belly-to-back suplex.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|[[Pepper Parks]] (bottom) performing a belly-to-back suplex on RJ City.]]\nFor the belly-to-back suplex, the wrestler stands behind his opponent and puts his head under the arm of the opponent. The wrestler then lifts the opponent up grabbing the waist and thigh of the opponent, so the opponent is on the attacker's shoulder. The attacker finally falls backwards, dropping the opponent flat on his back.<ref name=toa>[http://www.otherarena.com/nCo/finish/finish.html Finishing move list, from TheOtherArena.com]</ref><ref name=bbowm>[http://www.deathvalleydriver.com/bbbowm/part1.htm Big Book of Wrestling Moves, from DeathValleyDriver.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506000024/http://www.deathvalleydriver.com/bbbowm/part1.htm |date=2013-05-06 }}</ref>\n\nSome wrestlers perform the back suplex into a bridging position, simultaneously arching their own back and legs to elevate themselves, gaining leverage and [[Pinfall (professional wrestling)|pinning]] their opponent. Very popular in [[Mexico]]'s [[Lucha Libre]], where this bridging version is known as a '''Puente Griego''' or Greek Bridge in [[English language|English]]. In 2018, the Colombian referee [[Wilmar Roldan]] announced a campaign to introduce this variant of the suplex to international soccer.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=\nSpostamento di wrestling da introdurre nel calcio internazionale? |trans-title=Wrestling move to be introduced to international soccer? |newspaper=Gazzetta Dello Sport|location=Milan |date=2018-01-22}}</ref>\n\nSince the wrestler taking the move is falling backwards, the potential for injury is significant if it is not performed properly. Japanese wrestler [[Mitsuharu Misawa]] suffered a spinal injury which triggered a fatal cardiac arrest during his last match in 2009 after [[Akitoshi Saito]] gave him the belly to back suplex.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.f4wonline.com/content/view/9617/|title=Misawa Passes Away After Backdrop In Hiroshima Match|publisher=Wrestling Observer/Figure Four Online|date=2009-06-13|accessdate=2009-08-08}}</ref><ref name=\"Slam\">{{Cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2009/06/13/9788666.html|title=Japanese legend Mitsuharu Misawa dies in the ring|author=Schramm, Chris|work=Slam!

He then lifts the opponent up using both of his arms wrapped around the torso of the opponent. The attacker finally falls backwards to drive the opponent to the mat on their neck and shoulders.\n\n====Leg hook belly-to-back suplex====\nSometimes referred to as a leg lift back suplex or leg lift backdrop, it is applied just as a back suplex would be, except that the wrestler wraps only the near arm or no arm around the torso of their opponent. With the free arm(s), the wrestler then hoists their opponent's knees or thighs and throws them backwards in that manner.\n\n====Cobra clutch suplex====\nThe attacker places the opponent in a [[professional wrestling holds#Cobra clutch|cobra clutch hold]]. They then proceed to lift the opponent up and fall backwards, driving the opponent to the mat on their head.\n\n====Crossface chickenwing suplex====\nThe wrestler stands behind the opponent. He locks one of the opponent's arms in a [[Professional wrestling holds#Chickenwing|chickenwing]], and [[professional wrestling holds#Crossface|wraps his other arm around the opponent's head]]. He then lifts the opponent up and falls backwards, driving the opponent on to the top of their head, down to the mat.\n\n====Crotch clutch suplex====\nThis move involves the attacking wrestler approaching an opponent from behind, reaching down and grasping his crotch with both forearms, with hands together and facing upwards into his groin, and lifting him overhead into a belly-to-back release suplex. The opponent reacts to both the suplex and being grabbed and lifted by his crotch, to humorous effect. The move was popularized by [[Joey Ryan (wrestler)|Joey Ryan]], who dubs it the \"[[YouPorn]] Plex\".<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-sports/youporn-signs-joey-ryan-wrestlings-king-of-dong-style-40940/|title=YouPorn Signs Joey Ryan, Wrestling\u2019s 'King of Dong Style'|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|first=James|last=Montgomery|date=December 18, 2015|accessdate=January 26, 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Dragon suplex{{anchor|Full nelson suplex}}====\nThis belly-to-back suplex variation sees the wrestler apply a [[nelson hold#Full nelson|full nelson]] and then bridge his back, lifting the opponent over him and onto their shoulders down to the mat. The wrestler keeps his back arched and the hold applied, [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinning]] the opponent's shoulders down to the mat. The wrestler may also release the opponent mid-arch, throwing them down to the mat shoulders and neck first, in a variation known as release dragon suplex.\n\n====Electric chair suplex====\nAlso known as an [[Professional wrestling throws#Electric chair drop|electric chair slam]]. The wrestler lifts the opponent on their shoulders in an [[Professional wrestling holds#Electric chair|electric chair]] sitting position and then bridges his back, slamming the opponent down to the mat shoulder and upper back first.\n\n====German suplex====\nThe wrestler stands behind the opponent, grabs them around their waist, lifts them up, and falls backwards while bridging his back and legs, slamming the opponent down to the mat shoulder and upper back first. The wrestler keeps the waistlock and continues bridging with their back and legs, pinning the opponent's shoulders down against the mat. The regular pinning variation can be referred to as the German suplex pin. The wrestler can also release the opponent in mid arch, which is referred to as a release German suplex. Sometimes, rather than bridging for a pin, the wrestler may roll himself into another position to perform the move again, often referred to as multiple, rolling, or non-release German suplexes, in which the attacking wrestler performs a German suplex, then rolls his legs to get back into a standing position, but does ''not'' let the opponent go to do so. The attacking wrestler then repeats this numerous times, most commonly three, but sometimes up to eight or more. The most common WWE superstar that uses the manoeuvre is Brock Lesnar.\n\n====Straight jacket suplex{{anchor|X-Plex|X-plex}}====\n[[File:Adam Cole straightjacket german suplex.jpg|thumb|[[Adam Cole]] performing straight jacket suplex on [[Kevin Owens|Kevin Steen]]]]\nThe [[Professional wrestling holds#Straight jacket|straight jacket]] suplex or package German suplex has the attacker trapping the opponent's arms while performing a German suplex. Variants such as the cross-arm suplex or X-Plex see the opponent's arms crossed across their chest and held by the attacker. The wrestler then uses the crossed arms as leverage to aid in lifting the opponent up while falling backwards to throw the opponent as in a German suplex.\n\n====Half and half suplex====\nThis is a suplex variation in which the wrestler, while standing behind the opponent, places one arm in a [[nelson hold#Half nelson|half nelson]] and the other arm in a [[Professional wrestling holds#Chickenwing|chickenwing]]. The wrestler then proceeds to fall backwards while lifting the opponent overhead in the hold and driving them into the mat behind them. This move is referred to as a half and half suplex as it is a combination of a [[#Half nelson suplex|half nelson suplex]] and a [[#Tiger suplex|tiger suplex]]. The move can be either released or brought into a pin.\n\n====Half nelson suplex====\nThis is a version of a [[#German suplex|German suplex]] where the attacker stands behind the opponent, facing the same direction. The attacker uses one hand to apply a [[nelson hold#Half nelson|half nelson]] hold and wraps the other hand around the opponent's waist. The attacker then lifts the opponent up and falls backwards, dropping the opponent on their head, neck, or shoulders. The move can be either released or brought into a pin.\n\n====Pumphandle suplex====\nThe wrestler stands behind the opponent and bends him forward. One of the opponent's arms is pulled back between his legs and held, while the opponent's other arm is hooked by the attacker maneuvering his arm around in front of the opponent's shoulder (as in a [[professional wrestling holds#Pumphandle|pumphandle]]) and securing it behind the head (a [[nelson hold#Quarter nelson|quarter-nelson]]). The attacker then lifts his opponent up over his head and falls backwards to slam the opponent against the mat back-first.\n\nThere are many variations of the pumphandle suplex, including the maintaining of the grip in order to land the opponent on the mat face-first, or inverting the opponent's body position and securing the opponent's free arm using a [[nelson hold#Quarter nelson|half-nelson grip]] instead of the normal quarter-nelson.\n\n====Sleeper suplex====\nThe attacker places the opponent in a [[Professional wrestling holds#Sleeper hold|sleeper hold]] and then hooks one of the opponents arms with his free arm. The attacker then lifts the opponent up and falls backwards, driving the opponent on their head. A slight variation sees the attacker apply a [[kata ha jime|half nelson choke]] instead of the sleeper hold before performing the suplex.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/classics/classic-lists/the-50-coolest-maneuvers-of-all-time/page-16 |title=the 50 coolest maneuvers of all time|date=2014-02-21|accessdate=2014-03-13|publisher=WWE}}</ref>\n\n==== Katahajime suplex ====\nThe attacker stands behind the opponent, facing the same direction. The wrestler puts one arm in a half nelson and the other hand around the neck in front of the opponent, like in a sleeper. The hand in front of the neck is locked with the other hand at the wrist. With the grip secure, the attacker then lifts the opponent up and falls backwards, dropping the opponent on their head, neck, or shoulders. The move can end in a release or bridging position.\n\n'''Three-quarter nelson suplex'''\n\nThe attacker places their opponent in three-quarter nelson before lifting them and falling backwards, dropping them on their head or neck.\n\n====Tiger suplex {{anchor|Double chickenwing suplex}}====\n[[File:Tiger suplex by Tsukushi.JPG|thumb|220px|[[Tsukushi (wrestler)|Tsukushi]] performing a tiger suplex on [[Sendai Sachiko]].]]\nInnovated by [[Alfonso Dant\u00e9s]] and popularized by the original [[Tiger Mask (professional wrestling)|Tiger Mask]] ([[Satoru Sayama]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2008/07/30/6312326.html|title=Mexican great Alfonso Dant\u00e9s dies|author=Schramm, Chris|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=2010-02-21|date=July 31, 2008}}</ref> this move sees the wrestler standing behind their opponent, [[Professional wrestling holds#Double chickenwing|hooks both of the opponent's arms from the sides]], and places their hands palm down flat against the opponent's upper back. The wrestler then lifts the opponent up and falls backwards, arching their back and legs and then slamming the opponent down to the mat shoulder and neck first. Like other suplex variations, this move can either end in a bridging pin or be released upon execution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://headlockbackdrop.wordpress.com/2010/12/15/12-tiger-suplex/|title=Tiger suplex|accessdate=2013-06-06|publisher=Headlocks&Backdrops}}</ref>\n\n====Wheelbarrow suplex====\nThis move is performed when a wrestler wraps a forward-facing opponent's legs around their waist, in a [[Professional wrestling holds#Wheelbarrow|wheelbarrow hold]], from either standing behind an opponent who is laying face-first on the mat or by catching a charging opponent before then applying a waistlock to lift the opponent up off the ground into the air, then the attacking wrestler would continue lifting the opponent over their while falling backwards to hit belly-to-back suplex.\n\n==Belly-to-belly variants==\nIn these suplexes, the wrestlers begin by facing each other. The attacker then applies a bodylock before falling backwards and flipping the opponent onto his back and down on the mat.\n\n===Belly-to-belly suplex{{anchor|Belly to belly suplex}}===\n[[File:Bayley performing a Bayley-to-belly suplex on Alexa Bliss.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bayley (wrestler)|Bayley]] performs a Bayley-to-belly suplex (belly-to-belly suplex) on [[Alexa Bliss]]]]\nThe wrestler wraps their arms around the opponent in a waistlock or a bodylock position and flips them over by violently bridging their own body so the opponent lands on their back. This can be done either overhead or to the side. For a side belly-to-belly suplex, the attacker usually holds on to the opponent for the duration of the move, but for the overhead belly-to-belly suplex, the attacker usually executes an overhead throw and lets go of the opponent. It can also be performed in a \"snap\" fashion, where the attacker stomps down hard and suplexes the opponent stiffly, resulting in a quicker throw.\n\n====Capture suplex====\nThe attacker stands facing a standing opponent. The attacker then catches one leg of the opponent and pulls the opponent towards them so that they are face-to-face, with the attacker reaching under the opponent's leg and hooking it. The attacker then uses their free arm to reach behind the neck of the opponent and take hold of them. The attacker then quickly bridges backwards and releases the opponent, throwing them overhead, or turns 180\u00b0 while slamming the opponent down to the mat. This move can be used to counter a kick. The move is also known as the head and leg suplex, and can be seen as a variation of the head and arm suplex.\n\n====Double underhook suplex{{anchor|Double arm suplex|Butterfly suplex}}====\nAlso known as a double arm suplex, reverse nelson suplex, double axe handle suplex, and a butterfly suplex, the wrestler and opponent face each other, the opponent bent forward. The wrestler hooks the opponent's arms back in a [[Professional wrestling holds#Butterfly|reverse nelson]], placing his forearms in the crooks of the opponent's elbows, with his hands on top of the opponent's back in a butcher's grip. The wrestler then lifts the opponent into an upside-down vertical position and falls back, shifting the opponent to one side as the opponent flips over. The wrestler executing the suplex may release the reverse nelson hold during the throw, or can maintain the grip and attempt a bridging pin or submission hold transition upon impact.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wrestling.wonderhowto.com/how-to/do-butterfly-suplex-315172/|title=Double underhook suplex|accessdate=2013-06-06|publisher=WonderHowTo}}</ref>\n\n====Exploder suplex====\n[[File:Shelton Benjamin - T-Bone Suplex.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shelton Benjamin]] hits a variant of the T-Bone suplex, with a powerslam pin, on [[Carly Col\u00f3n|Carlito]].]]\nThe attacker stands facing his opponent and positions himself under one of the opponent's arms and wraps his arm around the opponent's neck and back (this position is similar to that of a [[Powerslam|side slam]]) and then grabs the leg of the opponent and tosses him backwards, over the attacker's head. Several other variations exist, such as the wrist-clutch exploder suplex (often called '''Exploder '98''') and the bridging exploder suplex (also called '''Blizzard Suplex''').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://headlockbackdrop.wordpress.com/2010/12/20/17-exploder-suplex/|title=Exploder suplex|accessdate=2013-06-06|publisher=Headlocks&Backdrops}}</ref>\n\n====Head-and-arm suplex====\nAlso called a gargoyle suplex, the move is a variation of the traditional overhead belly-to-belly suplex in which the wrestler, standing face-to-face with his opponent, clutches his hands together having firmly encircled the opponent's head and one arm.  This grip, as opposed to the waistlock of a normal belly-to-belly, is then used to hoist the opponent in the overhead arching throw.\n\n====Northern Lights suplex{{anchor|Northern lights suplex}}====\n[[File:Alicia Fox Northern lights suplex on Dana Brooke.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alicia Fox]] performs a Northern Lights suplex w/ bridge on [[Dana Brooke]]]]\nFounder\u3000: Hiroshi Hase(Japanese Minister).The attacking wrestler puts his head under the arm of the opponent, wraps his arms around the waist of the opponent and flips him/her backwards. This suplex can either be released or bridged into a pin. The wrestler can also float over into another Northern Lights suplex.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wrestling.wonderhowto.com/how-to/do-northern-lights-suplex-pro-wrestling-move-417507/|title=Northern Lights suplex|accessdate=2013-06-06|publisher=WonderHowTo}}</ref>\n\n====Table top suplex====\n{{see also|[[Professional wrestling throws#Fallaway slam|Fallaway slam]]}}\nAlso known as a fallaway slam, the wrestler lifts the opponent up so the opponent is horizontal across the wrestler's body then falls backward, throwing the opponent over their head down to the mat back-first. This slam can be either bridged into a pin, or the wrestler can float over into another fallaway slam. This move is sometimes used as a continuation move from catching the opponent's high-cross body, to emphasize the wrestler's strength.\n\n====Trapping suplex====\nThis is when a wrestler holds both the opponent's arms under his own (known as ''overhooks'' in mixed martial arts and amateur wrestling, as the arms loop under the opponent's arms from above) with the hands connected below the opponent's triceps, from here the opponent is left secure and unable to counter or move away from the attacker while he/she delivers a belly-to-belly throw flipping the opponent overhead in the normal belly-to-belly motion. In amateur wrestling and other contact-sports, the trapping suplex is called the suicide throw. It is done slightly differently, usually the opponent is tossed to the side and lands on their back.\n\nThis move consists of one wrestler picking up his or her opponent off the ground (or mat) and then using a large portion of his or her own body weight to drive the opponent down on the mat. He or she begins face-to-face, then the attacker forces the opponent's head down and locks the opponent's arm around it.\n\n==Side variants==\nIn the side variants the attacker stands to the side of his or her opponent and applies a hold before falling backwards to slam the opponent to the mat. The most common is the [[#Saito suplex|Saito suplex]].\n\n===Gutwrench suplex===\nThis throw involves a wrestler standing on one side of a prone opponent locking both arms around the opponent's waist [[Professional wrestling holds#Gutwrench|near arm in front of the opponent and far arm behind]], and lifting him/her up to slam him/her over back-first down to the mat. An inverted version also exists.\n\n===Saito suplex===\nThe attacker stands either facing directly one of their opponent's sides or slightly behind in an angle. He places the opponent's near arm over his shoulder, grabs a waistlock, and then lifts the opponent up while falling backwards, causing the opponent to land on their neck and shoulders.\n\n[[File:Allysin Kay Cut-Throat.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Allysin Kay]] performing a Leg-hook Saito suplex]]\nThere is also a leg-hook variation where the attacker stands behind and to one side of the opponent. The attacker wraps one arm around the waist of the opponent and grabs the back of the opponent's near leg with their other arm. The attacker then lifts the opponent on to their shoulder and then falls backwards, driving the opponent into the mat at a high angle.\n\n===Side suplex===\n:''See [[Powerslam#Uranage|Ura-nage]] or [[Professional wrestling throws#Russian legsweep|Russian legsweep]].''\nThis move is also known as a sambo suplex or side suplex. To perform it, the wrestler stands face-to-face with the opponent, slightly to their side. The wrestler either reaches across the opponent's chest and around their neck with their near arm and locks both hands behind the opponent's shoulders or just locks both hands behind the opponent's waist. The wrestler then simultaneously lifts the opponent up, twists 180\u00b0 and falls backwards, bringing the opponent over them and slamming the opponent back-first on the mat.\n\nThe name ura-nage (or uranage) comes from a Judo throw which translated directly from Japanese, means \"throw to behind/back\" and is commonly (albeit incorrectly) used to refer to a regular side slam in pro wrestling. The Judo ura-nage throw more closely resembles a saito suplex in execution.\n\n====Cravate suplex====\nThis sees a wrestler lock their opponent in a [[Professional wrestling holds#Three-quarter facelock|cravate]] and pull down with their arms so that the opponent is forced to bend over. The wrestler then positions the opponent so that they are facing across the body of the wrestler and with their head in front of the wrestlers chest while stil standing. The wrestler then falls backwards, pulling upwards with the cravate and forcing the opponent off their feet into the air and over the wrestler, landing on their neck and shoulders.\n\n==Inverted facelock variants==\nIn these suplexes, an attacker begins by facing the back of an opponent and applying an [[Professional wrestling holds#Inverted facelock|inverted facelock]] before executing a throw. In most, the opponent is suspended upside-down during part of the move.\n\n=inverse Suplex\nAlso known as a reverse suplex, this move sees the attacker stands behind an opponent and applies an inverted facelock with one arm, and uses the other arm to aid in elevating the opponent so that he/she is lifted up and held upside-down before the attacker falls to his back driving the opponent down to the mat face first, behind the attacker.\n\n==In other sports==\nSuplex tackles in [[gridiron football]] are not allowed and may be subject to penalties or even fines.<ref name=\"Moddejonge\">{{cite news|last1=Moddejonge|first1=Gerry|title=Back-to-back interceptions avoid CFL version of Montreal Screwjob|url=http://www.edmontonsun.com/2016/08/12/back-to-back-interceptions-avoid-cfl-version-of-montreal-screwjob|accessdate=13 August 2016|work=Edmonton Sun|date=13 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Professional wrestling throws]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20121028142636/http://www.deathvalleydriver.com/bbbowm/part3.htm \"Professional Wrestling Moves: Part 3\"] Death Valley Driver.com\n*''The Professional Wrestlers' Workout & Instructional Guide'' - [[Harley Race]], [[Ricky Steamboat]], [[Les Thatcher]], and [[Alex Marvez]] pg. 80-84\n{{Wrestling Moves}}\n\n[[Category:Wrestling]]\n[[Category:Professional wrestling moves]]\n\n[[de:Liste der Wrestling-Kampftechniken#Suplessen]]\n", "name_user": "Josstiyn", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eGerman suplex", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suplex"}

Although she had no references, Mary Stace Willis, the wife of the then extremely popular author [[Nathaniel Parker Willis]], accepted to hire Jacobs as the nanny of her baby daughter Imogen. The two women agreed on a trial period of one week, not suspecting that the relationship between the two families would last into the next generation, until the death of Louisa Matilda Jacobs at the home of Edith Willis Grinnell, the daughter of Nathaniel Willis and his second wife, in 1917.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.''

She asked Mary Willis for a leave of two weeks and went to her brother John in [[Boston]]. John Jacobs, in his capacity as personal servant, had accompanied his owner Sawyer on his marriage trip through the North in 1838. He had gained his freedom by leaving his master in New York. After that he had gone [[whaling]] and had been absent for more than three years. From Boston, Harriet Jacobs wrote to her grandmother asking her to send Joseph there, so that he could live there with his uncle John. After Joseph's arrival, she returned to her work as Imogen Willis's nanny.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;72.</ref>\nHer work with the Willis family came to an abrupt end in October 1843, when Jacobs learned that her whereabouts had been betrayed to Norcom. Again, she had to flee to Boston, which where the strength of the [[Abolitionism|abolitionist movement]] guaranteed a certain level of security.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;74.</ref> Moving to Boston also gave her the opportunity to take her daughter Louisa Matilda from the house of Sawyer's cousin in Brooklyn, where she had been treated not much better than a slave.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.''

Nathaniel Willis took his daughter Imogen on a ten-month visit to the family of his deceased wife in England. For the journey, Jacobs resumed her job as nanny. In her autobiography, she reflects on the experiences made during the journey: She didn't notice any sign of racism, which often embittered her life in the USA. In consequence of this, she gained a new access to her Christian faith. At home, Christian ministers treating blacks with contempt or even buying and selling slaves had been an obstacle to her spiritual life.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;83\u201387.</ref>\n\n== The Autobiography ''Incidents in the Life of A Slave Girl''  ==\n''This section is about the genesis of Jacobs's autobiography, seen as part of the story of her life. For the content and an analysis of the autobiography, see the article [[Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl]]''.\n\n==== Background: Abolitionism and early feminism ====\n\n[[File:William Lloyd Garrison, abolitionist, journalist, and editor of The Liberator LCCN2017660623 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|William Lloyd Garrison]]\nJohn S. Jacobs got more and more involved with abolitionism, i.&nbsp;e. the anti-slavery movement led by [[William Lloyd Garrison]]. He undertook several lecture tours, either alone or with fellow abolistionists, among them [[Frederick Douglass]], three years his junior.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;98.</ref> In 1849, John S. Jacobs took responsibility for the ''Anti-Slavery Office and Reading Room'' in [[Rochester, New York]]. His sister Harriet supported him, having been relieved of the daily care for her children (Joseph had left the Boston print shop where his mother had apprenticed him after suffering from racist abuse and had gone on a whaling voyage while his mother had been in England, and Louisa had been sent to a boarding school).<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;102-103.</ref>\n\nThe former \u201eslave girl\u201c who had never been to school, and whose life had mostly been confined by the struggle for her own survival in dignity and that of her children, now found herself in circles that were about to change America through their - by the standards of the time - radical set of ideas. The ''Reading Room'' was in the same building as the newspaper ''[[The North Star (anti-slavery newspaper)|The North Star]]'', run by Frederick Douglass, who today is considered the most influential African American of his century. Jacobs lived at the house of the white couple [[Amy and Isaac Post]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rrlc.org/winningthevote/biographies/amy-post/ |title=Amy Post |publisher=Rochester Regional Library Council |accessdate=December 6, 2019}}</ref> Douglass and the Posts were staunch enimies of slavery and racism, and supporters of [[women's suffrage]]. The year before, Douglass and Amy Post had attended the [[Seneca Falls Convention]], the world's first convention on women's rights, and had signed the [[Declaration of Sentiments]], which demanded equal rights for women.\n\n===== Obtaining legal freedom =====\n\nIn 1850, Jacobs paid a visit to Nathaniel Parker Willis in New York, wanting to see the now eight-years old Imogen again. Willis's second wife, Cornelia Grinnell Willis, who had not recovered well after the birth of her second child, prevailed upon Jacobs once again to become the nanny of the Willis children. Knowing that this involved a considerable risk for Jacobs, especially since the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850]] had made it much easier for slaveholders to reclaim their fugitive \"chattels\", she gave her word to John S. Jacobs that she would not let his sister fall into the hands of her persecutors.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;108\u2013110.</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1851, Jacobs was again informed that she was in danger of being recaptured. Cornelia Willis sent Jacobs together with her (Willis's) one-year old daughter Lilian to Massachusetts which was comparatively safe. Jacobs, in whose autobiography the constant danger for herself and other slave mothers of being separated from their children is an important theme, spoke to her employer of the sacrifice that letting go of her baby daughter meant to her. Cornelia Willis answered by explaining that the slave catchers would have to return the baby to the mother, if Jacobs should be caught. She would then try to rescue Jacobs.<ref>{{citation|title=Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl. Written by Herself |date= |pages=291 |language=en |url=http://docsouth.unc.edu/fpn/jacobs/jacobs.html#jac291 |access-date=September 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1852, Jacobs read in the newspaper that her legal owner, the daughter of the recently deceased Dr. Norcom, had arrived at a New York Hotel together with her husband, obviously intending to re-claim their fugitive slave. Again, Cornelia Willis sent Jacobs to Massachusetts together with Lilian. Some days later, she wrote a letter to Jacobs informing her of her intention to buy Jacobs's freedom. Jacobs replied that she preferred to join her brother who had gone to California. Regardless, Cornelia Willis bought her freedom for $300. In her autobiography, Jacobs describes her mixed feelings: Bitterness at the thought that \"a human being [was] ''sold'' in the free city of New York\", happiness at the thought that her freedom was secured, and \"love\" and \"gratitude\" for Cornelia Willis.<ref>{{citation|title=Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.

Soon, she developed enough trust in Amy Post to be able to tell her her story which she had kept secret for so long. Post later described how difficult it was for Jacobs to tell of her traumatic experiences: \"Though impelled by a natural craving for human sympathy, she passed through a baptism of suffering, even in recounting her trials to me. ... The burden of these memories lay heavily on her spirit\".<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;104.</ref>\n\nIn late 1852 or early 1853, Amy Post suggested that Jacobs should write her life story. Jacobs's brother had for some time been urging her to do so, and she felt a moral obligation to tell her story to help build public support for the antislavery cause and thus save others from suffering a similar fate.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;118-119.</ref>\n\nStill, Jacobs had acted against moral ideas commonly shared in her time, shared including by herself, by consenting to a sexual relationship with Sawyer. The shame caused by this memory and the resulting fear of having to tell her story had been the reason for her initially avoiding contact with the abolitionist movement her brother John had joined in the 1840s.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;78.</ref> Finally, Jacobs overcame her trauma and feeling of shame, and she consented to publish her story. Her reply to Post describing her internal struggle has survived.<ref>Transcribed in the appendix to Harriet Jacobs: Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl: Written by Herself. Cambridge 2000, p.&nbsp;253\u2013255. Summarized in Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;118-119.</ref>\n\n==== Writing of the manuscript ====\nAt first, Jacobs didn't feel that she was up to writing a book. She wrote a short outline of her story and asked Amy Post to send it to [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]], proposing to tell her story to Stowe so that Stowe could transform it into a book. Before Stowe's answer arrived, Jacobs read in the papers that the famous author, whose [[Uncle Tom's Cabin]], published in 1852, had become an instant bestseller, was going to England. Jacobs then asked Cornelia Willis to propose to Stowe that Jacobs's daughter Louisa accompany her to England and tell the story during the journey. In reply, Stowe forwarded the story outline to Willis and declined to let Louisa join her, citing the possibility of Louisa being spoiled by too much sympathy shown to her in England. Jacobs felt betrayed because her employer thus came to know about the parentage of her children, which was the cause for Jacobs feeling ashamed. In a letter to Post, she analyzed the racist thinking behind Stowe's remark on Louisa with bitter irony: \"what a pity we poor blacks can[']t have the firmness and stability of character that you white people have.\" In consequence, Jacobs gave up the idea of enlisting Stowe's help.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;119\u2013121; Harriet Jacobs: Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl: Written by Herself.

Written by [[Julia Tyler]], wife of former president [[John Tyler]], the text claimed that the household slaves were \"well clothed and happy\". Jacobs spent the whole night writing a reply, which she sent to the ''[[New York Tribune]]''. Her letter,<ref>{{citation|title=LETTER FROM A FUGITIVE SLAVE. Slaves Sold under Peculiar Circumstances |date= |language=en |url=http://docsouth.unc.edu/fpn/jacobs/support16.html |access-date=December 7, 2019}}</ref> signed \"A Fugitive Slave\", published on June 21, was her first text to be printed. Her biographer, [[Jean Fagan Yellin]], comments, \"When the letter was printed ..., an author was born.\".<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;122-123.</ref>\n\nIn October 1853, she wrote to Amy Post that she had decided to become the author of her own story. In the same letter, only a few lines earlier, she had informed Post of her grandmother's death.<ref>The date of Molly Horniblow's burial in Edenton was September 4, 1853, Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, note to p.124 on p.306.</ref> Yellin concludes that the \"death of her revered grandmother\" made it possible for Jacobs to \"reveal her troubled sexual history\" which she could never have done \"while her proud, judgmental grandmother lived.\"<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;124\u2013126.</ref>\n\nWhile using the little spare time a children's nurse had to write her story, Jacobs lived with the Willis family at Idlewild, their new country residence. With N.P.Willis being largely forgotten today,<ref>\"... when N.P.Willis is mentioned today it is generally as a footnote to some else's story.\"; Baker, Thomas N. Sentiment and Celebrity: Nathaniel Parker Willis and the Trials of Literary Fame. New York, Oxford University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-19-512073-6}}, p.&nbsp;4.</ref> Yellin comments on the irony of the situation: \"Idlewild had been conceived as a famous writer's retreat, but its owner never imagined that it was his children's nurse who would create an American classic there\".<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;126.</ref>\n\nBy mid-1857 her work was finally nearing completion and she asked Amy Post for a preface. Even in this letter she mentions the shame that made writing her story difficult for herself: \"as much pleasure as it would afford me and as great an honor as I would deem it to have your name associated with my Book \u2013Yet believe me dear friend[,] there are many painful things in it \u2013 that make me shrink from asking the sacrifice from one so good and pure as your self\u2013.\"<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;135.</ref>\n\n==== Searching for a publisher ====\n[[File:John Brown. Meeting the slave-mother and her child on the steps of Charlestown jail on his way to execution LCCN2003674588.jpg|251x251px|thumb|left|Abolitionist drawing of a scene that probably never happened: John Brown meets a slave mother and her child while being led to execution]]\nIn May 1858, Harriet Jacobs sailed to England, hoping to find a publisher there. She carried good letters of introduction, but wasn't able to get her manuscript into print. The reasons for her failure are not clear. Yellin supposes that her contacts among the British abolitionists feared that the story of her liaison with Sawyer would be too much for Victorian Britain's prudery. Disheartened, Jacobs returned to her work at Idlewild and made no further efforts to publish her book until the fall of 1859.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;136\u2013140.</ref>\n\nOn October 16, 1859 the anti-slavery activist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] tried to incite a slave rebellion at [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry|Harper's Ferry]]. Brown, who was executed in December, was considered a martyr and hero by many abolitionists, among them Harriet Jacobs, who added a tribute to Brown as the final chapter to her manuscript. She then sent the manuscript to publishers Phillips and Samson in Boston. They were ready to publish it under the condition that either Nathaniel Parker Willis or Harriet Beecher Stowe would supply a preface. Jacobs was unwilling to ask Willis, who held pro-slavery views, but she asked Stowe, who declined. Soon after, the publishers failed, thus frustrating Jacobs's second attempt to get her story printed.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;140.</ref>\n\n==== Lydia Maria Child as the book's editor ====\nJacobs now contacted [[Thayer and Eldridge]], who had recently published a sympathizing biography of John Brown.<ref>The Public Life of Capt. John Brown by James Redpath.</ref> Thayer and Eldridge demanded a preface by [[Lydia Maria Child]]. Jacobs confessed to Amy Post, that after suffering another rejection from Stowe, she could hardly bring herself to asking another famous writer, but she \"resolved to make my last effort\".<ref>Jacobs to Post, October 8, 1860, cf. Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;140 and note on p.314.</ref>\n\nJacobs met Child in Boston, and Child not only agreed to write a preface, but also to become the editor of the book. Child then re-arranged the material according to a more chronological order. She also suggested to drop the final chapter on Brown, and to add more information on the anti-black violence which occurred in Edenton after [[Nat Turner|Nat Turner's 1831 rebellion]]. During this work she kept contact with Jacobs via mail, but the two women failed to meet a second time during the editing process, because with Cornelia Willis passing through a dangerous pregnancy and premature birth Jacobs was not able to leave Idlewild.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;140-142.</ref>\n\nAfter the book had been [[Stereotype (printing)|stereotyped]], Thayer and Eldridge, too, failed. Jacobs succeeded in buying the stereotype plates and to get the book printed and bound.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;142-143.</ref>\n\nIn January 1861, nearly four years after she had finished the manuscript, Jacobs's ''Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl'' finally appeared before the public. The next month, her brother John S. published his own, much shorter memoir, entitled ''A True Tale of Slavery'', in London. Both siblings relate in their respective narratives their own experiences, experiences made together, and episodes in the life of the other sibling.\n\nIn her book, Harriet Jacobs doesn't mention the town or even the state, where she was held as a slave, and changes all personal names, given names as well as family names, with the only exception of the Post couple, whose names are given correctly. However, John Jacobs (called \"William\" in his sister's book) mentions Edenton as his birth place and uses the correct given names, but abbreviates most family names. So Dr. Norcom is \"Dr. Flint\" in Harriet's book, but \"Dr. N-\" in John's. An author's name is not given on the title page, but the \"Preface by the author\" is signed \"Linda Brent\" and the narrator is called by that name throughout the story.\n\n==== Reception of the book ====\nThe book was promoted via the abolitionist networks and was well received by the critics. Jacobs arranged for a publication in Great Britain, which was published in the first months of 1862, soon followed by a pirated edition.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;151-152.</ref>\n\nThe publication did not cause contempt as Jacobs had feared. On the contrary, Jacobs gained respect. Although she had used a pseudonym, in abolitionist circles she was regularly introduced with words like \"Mrs. Jacobs, the author of Linda\", thereby conceding her the honorific \"Mrs.\" which normally was reserved for married women.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;161.</ref> The ''[[The Daily News (UK)|London Daily News]]'' wrote in 1862, that Linda Brent was a true \"heroine\", giving an example \"of endurance and persistency in the struggle for liberty\" and \"moral rectitude\".<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;152.</ref>\n\n== Civil War and Reconstruction Work ==\n==== Relief work and politics ====\n[[File:The Old Flag Never Touched the Ground.jpg|thumb|right|Heroicized painting of the famous assault on [[Fort Wagner]] by the 54th Massachusetts, July 1863.]]\n[[File:Slave pen. Interior view01468v.jpg|thumb|left|Slave pen of an unnamed trader in Alexandria, Virginia. Photograph from the 1860s. Jacobs describes her visit to Birch's (formerly [[Franklin and Armfield Office|Franklin and Armfield's]]) slave pen in her report ''Life among the Contrabands''.]]\nAfter the [[1860 United States presidential election|election]] of president [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] in November 1860, the slavery question caused first the secession of most slave states and then the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Thousands of African Americans, having escaped from slavery in the South, gathered just north of the front. Since Lincoln's administration continued to regard them as their masters' property, these refugees were in most cases declared \"contraband of war\" and simply called \"[[Contraband (American Civil War)|Contrabands]]\". Many of them found refuge in makeshift camps, suffering and dying from want of the most basic necessities. Originally, Jacobs had planned to follow the example her brother John S. had set nearly two decades ago and become an abolitionist speaker, but now she saw that helping the ''Contrabands'' would mean rendering her race a service more urgently needed.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;157.</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1862, Harriet Jacobs went to [[Washington, D.C.]] and neighboring [[Alexandria, Virginia]]. She summarized her experiences during the first months in a report entitled ''Life among the Contrabands'', published in September in Garrison's ''[[The Liberator (newspaper)|The Liberator]]''. The author was featured as \"Mrs. Jacobs, the author of 'Linda'\". This report is a description of the fugitives' misery designed to appeal to donors, but it is also a political denunciation of slavery. Jacobs emphasizes her conviction that the [[freedman|freedmen]] will be able to build self-determined lives, if they get the necessary support.<ref>{{citation|title=Life among the Contrabands|language=en|url=https://docsouth.unc.edu/fpn/jacobs/support5.html|access-date=December 22, 2019\n}}. Summary of the report in: Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;159\u2013161.</ref>\n\nDuring the fall of 1862, she traveled through the North using her popularity as author of ''Incidents'' to build up a network to support her relief work.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;161-162.</ref> The ''New York Friends'' (i.e. the [[Quakers]]) gave her credentials as a relief agent.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;164.</ref>\n\nFrom January 1863, she made Alexandria the center of her activity. Together with Quaker [[Julia Wilbur]], the teacher, feminist and abolitionist, whom she had already known in Rochester, she was distributing clothes and blankets and at the same time struggling with incompetent, corrupt, or openly racist authorities.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;164\u2013174.</ref>\n\nWhile doing relief work in Alexandria, Jacobs was also involved in the political world. In May 1863 she attended the yearly conference of the New England Anti-Slavery Society in Boston. Together with the other participants she watched the parade of the newly created [[54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment]],<ref>For the symbolic and political value of this regiment cf. David W. Blight, Frederick Douglass. Prophet of Freedom. New York 2018, pp.&nbsp;388\u2013402, especially p.&nbsp;398.</ref> consisting of black soldiers led by white officers. Since the Lincoln administration had declined to use African American soldiers only a few months past, this was a highly symbolic event. Jacobs expressed her joy and pride in a letter to Lydia Maria Child: \"How my heart swelled with the thought that my poor oppressed race were to strike a blow for freedom !\" <ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;168\u2013169.</ref>\n\n==== The Jacobs School ====\n[[File:Jacobs School 1864.jpg|thumb|left|Harriet and Louisa Matilda Jacobs and their students in front of the Jacobs School, Alexandria, Virginia, 1864]]\nIn most slave states, teaching slaves to read and write had been forbidden. Virginia had even prohibited teaching these skills to free blacks. After Union troops occupied Alexandria in 1861, some schools for blacks emerged, but there was not a single free school under African American control. Jacobs supported a project conceived by the black community in 1863 to found a new school. In the fall of 1863 her daughter Louisa Matilda who had been trained as a teacher, came to Alexandria in the company of Virginia Lawton, a black friend of the Jacobs family. After some struggle with white missionaries from the North who wanted to take control of the school, the ''Jacobs School'' opened in January 1864 under Louisa Matilda's leadership. In the ''National Anti-Slavery Standard'', Harriet Jacobs explained that it was not disapproval of white teachers that made her fight for the school being controlled by the black community. But she wanted to help the former slaves, who had been raised \"to look upon the white race as their natural superiors and masters\", to develop \"respect for their race\".<ref>H.Jacobs to L.M.Child, published in ''National Anti-Slavery Standard'', entitled {{citation|title=Letter from Teachers of the Freedmen|date=April 16, 1864|language=en|url=https://docsouth.unc.edu/fpn/jacobs/support4.html|access-date=December 31, 2019\n}}; cf.

For the context, pp.&nbsp;176-178.</ref>\n\nJacobs's work in Alexandria was recognized on the local as well as on the national level, especially in abolitionist circles. In the spring of 1864 she was elected to the executive committee of the ''[[Women's Loyal National League]]'', a women's organization founded in 1863 in response to an appeal by [[Susan B. Anthony]] which aimed at collecting signatures for a [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|constitutional amendment]] to abolish slavery.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;175\u2013176.</ref> On August 1, 1864 she delivered the speech on occasion of the celebration of the [[Emancipation of the British West Indies|British West Indian Emancipation]]<ref>A celebration introduced by the abolitionists in order to demonstrate the backwardness of the US in comparison with the British colonies.</ref> in front of the African American soldiers of a military hospital in Alexandria. Many abolitionists, among them Frederick Douglass,<ref>David W. Blight, Frederick Douglass. Prophet of Freedom. New York 2018, p.&nbsp;418. This is the only time Jacobs is mentioned in this book, while Douglass is mentioned on 30 different pages in Yellin, Harriet Jacobs (according to the index).</ref> stopped over in Alexandria while touring the South in order to see Jacobs and her work.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;181\u2013183.</ref> On a personal level, she found her labors highly rewarding. Already in December 1862 she had written to Amy Post that the preceding six months had been the happiest in her whole life.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;162, cf. p.&nbsp;167.</ref>\n\n==== Relief work with freedmen in Savannah ====\n[[File:Nast on Andrew Johnson.jpg|thumb|left|Cartoon of [[Andrew Johnson]], depicting the President disbanding the [[Freedmen's Bureau]].]]\n[[File:Visit of the Ku-Klux 1872.jpg|thumb|right|Terror by the Ku-Klux-Klan, engraving published in [[Harper's Weekly]], February 1872]]\nMother and daughter Jacobs continued their relief work in Alexandria until after the victory of the Union. Convinced that the freedmen in Alexandria were able to care for themselves,<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;186.</ref> they followed the call of the ''New England Freedmen's Aid Society'' for teachers to help instruct the freedmen in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. They arrived in [[Savannah, Georgia]] in November 1865, only 11 months after the slaves there had been freed by [[Sherman's March to the Sea]]. During the following months they distributed clothes, opened a school and were planning to start an orphanage and an asylum for old people.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;190\u2013194.</ref>\n\nBut the political situation had changed: Lincoln had been assassinated and his successor [[Andrew Johnson]] was a Southerner and former slaveholder. He ordered the removal of many freedmen from the land which had been allotted to them by the army just one year before. The land question together with the unjust labor contracts forced on the former slaves by the former masters with the help of the army, are an important subject in Jacobs's reports from Georgia.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;191\u2013195.</ref>\n\nAlready in July 1866, mother and daughter Jacobs left Savannah which was more and more suffering from anti-black violence. Once again, Harriet Jacobs went to Idlewild, to assist Cornelia Willis in caring for her dying husband until his death in January 1867.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;200\u2013202.</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1867, she visited the widow of her uncle Mark who was the only survivor of the family still living in Edenton. At the end of the year she untertook her last journey to Great Britain in order to collect money for the projected orphanage and asylum in Savannah. But after her return she had to realize that the anti-black terror in Georgia by the [[Ku-Klux-Klan]] and other groups rendered these projects impossible. The money collected was given to the asylum fund of the ''New York Friends''.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;210-211, 217 and note on p.&nbsp;345.</ref>\n\nIn the 1860s a personal tragedy occurred: In the early 1850s, her son Joseph had gone to California to [[California Gold Rush|search for gold]] together with his uncle John. Later the two had continued on to Australia. John S. Jacobs later went to England, while Joseph stayed in Australia. Some time later, no more letters reached Jacobs from Australia. Using her connections to Australian clergymen, Child had an appeal on behalf of her friend read in Australian churches, but to no avail. Jacobs never again heard of her son.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;224-225.</ref>\n\n===Later years and death===\n[[File:HarrietJacobsGrave.jpg|thumb|right|Grave of Harriet Jacobs]]\nAfter her return from England, Jacobs retired to private life. In [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], she kept a [[boarding house]] together with her daughter. Among her boarders were faculty members of nearby [[Harvard University]]. In 1873, her brother John S. returned to the U.S. together with his English wife, their son Joseph and two stepchildren to live close to his sister in Cambridge. He died in December of the same year, 1873. In 1877 Harriet and Louisa Jacobs moved to Washington, D.C., where Louisa hoped to get work as a teacher. However, she found work only for short periods. Mother and daughter again took to keeping a boarding house, until in 1887/88 Harriet Jacobs became too sick to continue with the boarding house. Mother and daughter took on odd jobs and were supported by friends, among them Cornelia Willis. Harriet Jacobs died on March 7, 1897 in Washington, D.C., and was buried at [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]] in Cambridge next to her brother. Her tombstone reads, \"Patient in tribulation, fervent in spirit serving the Lord\". (Cf. [[Epistle to the Romans]], 12:11-12)<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;217\u2013261.</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nPrior to [[Jean Fagan Yellin]]'s research in the 1980s, the accepted academic opinion, voiced by such historians as [[John Blassingame]], was that ''[[Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl]]'' was a fictional novel written by [[Lydia Maria Child]]. However, Yellin found and used a variety of historical documents, including from the [[Amy Post]] papers at the University of Rochester, state and local historical societies, and the Horniblow and Norcom papers at the North Carolina state archives, to establish both that Harriet Jacobs was the true author of ''Incidents,'' and that the narrative was her autobiography, not a work of fiction. Her edition of ''Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl'' was published in 1987 with the endorsement of Professor John Blassingame.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin, Harriet Jacobs: A Life. New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;xv-xx; Yellin, Jean Fagan and others, eds., The Harriet Jacobs Family Papers, 2 vols. (Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 2008), p.&nbsp;xxiii.</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Yellin published an exhaustive biography (394 pages) entitled ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life''. Yellin also conceived of the idea of the Harriet Jacobs Papers Project. In 2000, an advisory board for the project was established, and after funding was awarded, the project began on a full-time basis in September 2002. Of the approximately 900 documents by, to, and about Harriet Jacobs, her brother John S. Jacobs, and her daughter Louisa Matilda Jacobs amassed by the Project, over 300 were published in 2008 in a two volume edition entitled ''The Harriet Jacobs Family Papers''.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin, Harriet Jacobs: A Life.

Reynolds]] states that ''Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl'' \"and ''Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave'' are commonly viewed as the two most important slave narratives.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/11/books/to-be-a-slave.html| title=To Be a Slave| work=the New York Times| author= David S.

However, the trader was secretly in league with Sawyer, to whom he sold all three of them, thus frustrating Norcom's plan on revenge.

After Sawyer married in 1838, Jacobs asked her grandmother to remind him of his promise.

Although she had no references, Mary Stace Willis, the wife of the then extremely popular author [[Nathaniel Parker Willis]], accepted to hire Jacobs as the nanny of her baby daughter Imogen. The two women agreed on a trial period of one week, not suspecting that the relationship between the two families would last into the next generation, until the death of Louisa Matilda Jacobs at the home of Edith Willis Grinnell, the daughter of Nathaniel Willis and his second wife, in 1917.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.''

She asked Mary Willis for a leave of two weeks and went to her brother John in [[Boston]]. John Jacobs, in his capacity as personal servant, had accompanied his owner Sawyer on his marriage trip through the North in 1838. He had gained his freedom by leaving his master in New York. After that he had gone [[whaling]] and had been absent for more than three years. From Boston, Harriet Jacobs wrote to her grandmother asking her to send Joseph there, so that he could live there with his uncle John. After Joseph's arrival, she returned to her work as Imogen Willis's nanny.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;72.</ref>\nHer work with the Willis family came to an abrupt end in October 1843, when Jacobs learned that her whereabouts had been betrayed to Norcom. Again, she had to flee to Boston, which where the strength of the [[Abolitionism|abolitionist movement]] guaranteed a certain level of security.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;74.</ref> Moving to Boston also gave her the opportunity to take her daughter Louisa Matilda from the house of Sawyer's cousin in Brooklyn, where she had been treated not much better than a slave.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;68-69, 74.</ref>\n\nIn Boston Jacobs took on odd jobs.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;77-78, 87.</ref> Her stay there was interrupted by the death of Mary Stace Willis in March 1845. Nathaniel Willis took his daughter Imogen on a ten-month visit to the family of his deceased wife in England. For the journey, Jacobs resumed her job as nanny. In her autobiography, she reflects on the experiences made during the journey: She didn't notice any sign of racism, which often embittered her life in the USA. In consequence of this, she gained a new access to her Christian faith. At home, Christian ministers treating blacks with contempt or even buying and selling slaves had been an obstacle to her spiritual life.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;83\u201387.</ref>\n\n== The Autobiography ''Incidents in the Life of A Slave Girl''  ==\n''This section is about the genesis of Jacobs's autobiography, seen as part of the story of her life. For the content and an analysis of the autobiography, see the article [[Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl]]''.\n\n==== Background: Abolitionism and early feminism ====\n\n[[File:William Lloyd Garrison, abolitionist, journalist, and editor of The Liberator LCCN2017660623 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|William Lloyd Garrison]]\nJohn S. Jacobs got more and more involved with abolitionism, i.&nbsp;e. the anti-slavery movement led by [[William Lloyd Garrison]]. He undertook several lecture tours, either alone or with fellow abolistionists, among them [[Frederick Douglass]], three years his junior.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;98.</ref> In 1849, John S. Jacobs took responsibility for the ''Anti-Slavery Office and Reading Room'' in [[Rochester, New York]]. His sister Harriet supported him, having been relieved of the daily care for her children (Joseph had left the Boston print shop where his mother had apprenticed him after suffering from racist abuse and had gone on a whaling voyage while his mother had been in England, and Louisa had been sent to a boarding school).<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;102-103.</ref>\n\nThe former \u201eslave girl\u201c who had never been to school, and whose life had mostly been confined by the struggle for her own survival in dignity and that of her children, now found herself in circles that were about to change America through their - by the standards of the time - radical set of ideas. The ''Reading Room'' was in the same building as the newspaper ''[[The North Star (anti-slavery newspaper)|The North Star]]'', run by Frederick Douglass, who today is considered the most influential African American of his century. Jacobs lived at the house of the white couple [[Amy and Isaac Post]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rrlc.org/winningthevote/biographies/amy-post/ |title=Amy Post |publisher=Rochester Regional Library Council |accessdate=December 6, 2019}}</ref> Douglass and the Posts were staunch enimies of slavery and racism, and supporters of [[women's suffrage]]. The year before, Douglass and Amy Post had attended the [[Seneca Falls Convention]], the world's first convention on women's rights, and had signed the [[Declaration of Sentiments]], which demanded equal rights for women.\n\n===== Obtaining legal freedom =====\n\nIn 1850, Jacobs paid a visit to Nathaniel Parker Willis in New York, wanting to see the now eight-years old Imogen again. Willis's second wife, Cornelia Grinnell Willis, who had not recovered well after the birth of her second child, prevailed upon Jacobs once again to become the nanny of the Willis children. Knowing that this involved a considerable risk for Jacobs, especially since the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850]] had made it much easier for slaveholders to reclaim their fugitive \"chattels\", she gave her word to John S. Jacobs that she would not let his sister fall into the hands of her persecutors.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;108\u2013110.</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1851, Jacobs was again informed that she was in danger of being recaptured. Cornelia Willis sent Jacobs together with her (Willis's) one-year old daughter Lilian to Massachusetts which was comparatively safe. Jacobs, in whose autobiography the constant danger for herself and other slave mothers of being separated from their children is an important theme, spoke to her employer of the sacrifice that letting go of her baby daughter meant to her. Cornelia Willis answered by explaining that the slave catchers would have to return the baby to the mother, if Jacobs should be caught. She would then try to rescue Jacobs.<ref>{{citation|title=Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl. Written by Herself |date= |pages=291 |language=en |url=http://docsouth.unc.edu/fpn/jacobs/jacobs.html#jac291 |access-date=September 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1852, Jacobs read in the newspaper that her legal owner, the daughter of the recently deceased Dr. Norcom, had arrived at a New York Hotel together with her husband, obviously intending to re-claim their fugitive slave. Again, Cornelia Willis sent Jacobs to Massachusetts together with Lilian. Some days later, she wrote a letter to Jacobs informing her of her intention to buy Jacobs's freedom. Jacobs replied that she preferred to join her brother who had gone to California. Regardless, Cornelia Willis bought her freedom for $300. In her autobiography, Jacobs describes her mixed feelings: Bitterness at the thought that \"a human being [was] ''sold'' in the free city of New York\", happiness at the thought that her freedom was secured, and \"love\" and \"gratitude\" for Cornelia Willis.<ref>{{citation|title=Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.

Soon, she developed enough trust in Amy Post to be able to tell her her story which she had kept secret for so long. Post later described how difficult it was for Jacobs to tell of her traumatic experiences: \"Though impelled by a natural craving for human sympathy, she passed through a baptism of suffering, even in recounting her trials to me. ... The burden of these memories lay heavily on her spirit\".<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;104.</ref>\n\nIn late 1852 or early 1853, Amy Post suggested that Jacobs should write her life story. Jacobs's brother had for some time been urging her to do so, and she felt a moral obligation to tell her story to help build public support for the antislavery cause and thus save others from suffering a similar fate.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;118-119.</ref>\n\nStill, Jacobs had acted against moral ideas commonly shared in her time, shared including by herself, by consenting to a sexual relationship with Sawyer. The shame caused by this memory and the resulting fear of having to tell her story had been the reason for her initially avoiding contact with the abolitionist movement her brother John had joined in the 1840s.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;78.</ref> Finally, Jacobs overcame her trauma and feeling of shame, and she consented to publish her story. Her reply to Post describing her internal struggle has survived.<ref>Transcribed in the appendix to Harriet Jacobs: Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl: Written by Herself. Cambridge 2000, p.&nbsp;253\u2013255. Summarized in Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;118-119.</ref>\n\n==== Writing of the manuscript ====\nAt first, Jacobs didn't feel that she was up to writing a book. She wrote a short outline of her story and asked Amy Post to send it to [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]], proposing to tell her story to Stowe so that Stowe could transform it into a book. Before Stowe's answer arrived, Jacobs read in the papers that the famous author, whose [[Uncle Tom's Cabin]], published in 1852, had become an instant bestseller, was going to England. Jacobs then asked Cornelia Willis to propose to Stowe that Jacobs's daughter Louisa accompany her to England and tell the story during the journey. In reply, Stowe forwarded the story outline to Willis and declined to let Louisa join her, citing the possibility of Louisa being spoiled by too much sympathy shown to her in England. Jacobs felt betrayed because her employer thus came to know about the parentage of her children, which was the cause for Jacobs feeling ashamed. In a letter to Post, she analyzed the racist thinking behind Stowe's remark on Louisa with bitter irony: \"what a pity we poor blacks can[']t have the firmness and stability of character that you white people have.\" In consequence, Jacobs gave up the idea of enlisting Stowe's help.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.''

Written by [[Julia Tyler]], wife of former president [[John Tyler]], the text claimed that the household slaves were \"well clothed and happy\". Jacobs spent the whole night writing a reply, which she sent to the ''[[New York Tribune]]''. Her letter,<ref>{{citation|title=LETTER FROM A FUGITIVE SLAVE.

New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;122-123.</ref>\n\nIn October 1853, she wrote to Amy Post that she had decided to become the author of her own story. In the same letter, only a few lines earlier, she had informed Post of her grandmother's death.<ref>The date of Molly Horniblow's burial in Edenton was September 4, 1853, Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, note to p.124 on p.306.</ref> Yellin concludes that the \"death of her revered grandmother\" made it possible for Jacobs to \"reveal her troubled sexual history\" which she could never have done \"while her proud, judgmental grandmother lived.\"<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;124\u2013126.</ref>\n\nWhile using the little spare time a children's nurse had to write her story, Jacobs lived with the Willis family at Idlewild, their new country residence. With N.P.Willis being largely forgotten today,<ref>\"... when N.P.Willis is mentioned today it is generally as a footnote to some else's story.\"; Baker, Thomas N. Sentiment and Celebrity: Nathaniel Parker Willis and the Trials of Literary Fame.

New York 2004, p.&nbsp;126.</ref>\n\nBy mid-1857 her work was finally nearing completion and she asked Amy Post for a preface. Even in this letter she mentions the shame that made writing her story difficult for herself: \"as much pleasure as it would afford me and as great an honor as I would deem it to have your name associated with my Book \u2013Yet believe me dear friend[,] there are many painful things in it \u2013 that make me shrink from asking the sacrifice from one so good and pure as your self\u2013.\"<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.''

She carried good letters of introduction, but wasn't able to get her manuscript into print. The reasons for her failure are not clear. Yellin supposes that her contacts among the British abolitionists feared that the story of her liaison with Sawyer would be too much for Victorian Britain's prudery. Disheartened, Jacobs returned to her work at Idlewild and made no further efforts to publish her book until the fall of 1859.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;136\u2013140.</ref>\n\nOn October 16, 1859 the anti-slavery activist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] tried to incite a slave rebellion at [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry|Harper's Ferry]]. Brown, who was executed in December, was considered a martyr and hero by many abolitionists, among them Harriet Jacobs, who added a tribute to Brown as the final chapter to her manuscript. She then sent the manuscript to publishers Phillips and Samson in Boston. They were ready to publish it under the condition that either Nathaniel Parker Willis or Harriet Beecher Stowe would supply a preface. Jacobs was unwilling to ask Willis, who held pro-slavery views, but she asked Stowe, who declined. Soon after, the publishers failed, thus frustrating Jacobs's second attempt to get her story printed.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;140.</ref>\n\n==== Lydia Maria Child as the book's editor ====\nJacobs now contacted [[Thayer and Eldridge]], who had recently published a sympathizing biography of John Brown.<ref>The Public Life of Capt. John Brown by James Redpath.</ref> Thayer and Eldridge demanded a preface by [[Lydia Maria Child]]. Jacobs confessed to Amy Post, that after suffering another rejection from Stowe, she could hardly bring herself to asking another famous writer, but she \"resolved to make my last effort\".<ref>Jacobs to Post, October 8, 1860, cf. Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;140 and note on p.314.</ref>\n\nJacobs met Child in Boston, and Child not only agreed to write a preface, but also to become the editor of the book. Child then re-arranged the material according to a more chronological order. She also suggested to drop the final chapter on Brown, and to add more information on the anti-black violence which occurred in Edenton after [[Nat Turner|Nat Turner's 1831 rebellion]]. During this work she kept contact with Jacobs via mail, but the two women failed to meet a second time during the editing process, because with Cornelia Willis passing through a dangerous pregnancy and premature birth Jacobs was not able to leave Idlewild.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;140-142.</ref>\n\nAfter the book had been [[Stereotype (printing)|stereotyped]], Thayer and Eldridge, too, failed. Jacobs succeeded in buying the stereotype plates and to get the book printed and bound.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;142-143.</ref>\n\nIn January 1861, nearly four years after she had finished the manuscript, Jacobs's ''Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl'' finally appeared before the public. The next month, her brother John S. published his own, much shorter memoir, entitled ''A True Tale of Slavery'', in London. Both siblings relate in their respective narratives their own experiences, experiences made together, and episodes in the life of the other sibling.\n\nIn her book, Harriet Jacobs doesn't mention the town or even the state, where she was held as a slave, and changes all personal names, given names as well as family names, with the only exception of the Post couple, whose names are given correctly. However, John Jacobs (called \"William\" in his sister's book) mentions Edenton as his birth place and uses the correct given names, but abbreviates most family names. So Dr. Norcom is \"Dr. Flint\" in Harriet's book, but \"Dr. N-\" in John's. An author's name is not given on the title page, but the \"Preface by the author\" is signed \"Linda Brent\" and the narrator is called by that name throughout the story.\n\n==== Reception of the book ====\nThe book was promoted via the abolitionist networks and was well received by the critics. Jacobs arranged for a publication in Great Britain, which was published in the first months of 1862, soon followed by a pirated edition.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;151-152.</ref>\n\nThe publication did not cause contempt as Jacobs had feared. On the contrary, Jacobs gained respect. Although she had used a pseudonym, in abolitionist circles she was regularly introduced with words like \"Mrs. Jacobs, the author of Linda\", thereby conceding her the honorific \"Mrs.\" which normally was reserved for married women.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;161.</ref> The ''[[The Daily News (UK)|London Daily News]]'' wrote in 1862, that Linda Brent was a true \"heroine\", giving an example \"of endurance and persistency in the struggle for liberty\" and \"moral rectitude\".<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;152.</ref>\n\n== Civil War and Reconstruction Work ==\n==== Relief work and politics ====\n[[File:The Old Flag Never Touched the Ground.jpg|thumb|right|Heroicized painting of the famous assault on [[Fort Wagner]] by the 54th Massachusetts, July 1863.]]\n[[File:Slave pen. Interior view01468v.jpg|thumb|left|Slave pen of an unnamed trader in Alexandria, Virginia. Photograph from the 1860s. Jacobs describes her visit to Birch's (formerly [[Franklin and Armfield Office|Franklin and Armfield's]]) slave pen in her report ''Life among the Contrabands''.]]\nAfter the [[1860 United States presidential election|election]] of president [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] in November 1860, the slavery question caused first the secession of most slave states and then the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Thousands of African Americans, having escaped from slavery in the South, gathered just north of the front. Since Lincoln's administration continued to regard them as their masters' property, these refugees were in most cases declared \"contraband of war\" and simply called \"[[Contraband (American Civil War)|Contrabands]]\". Many of them found refuge in makeshift camps, suffering and dying from want of the most basic necessities. Originally, Jacobs had planned to follow the example her brother John S. had set nearly two decades ago and become an abolitionist speaker, but now she saw that helping the ''Contrabands'' would mean rendering her race a service more urgently needed.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;157.</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1862, Harriet Jacobs went to [[Washington, D.C.]] and neighboring [[Alexandria, Virginia]]. She summarized her experiences during the first months in a report entitled ''Life among the Contrabands'', published in September in Garrison's ''[[The Liberator (newspaper)|The Liberator]]''. The author was featured as \"Mrs. Jacobs, the author of 'Linda'\". This report is a description of the fugitives' misery designed to appeal to donors, but it is also a political denunciation of slavery. Jacobs emphasizes her conviction that the [[freedman|freedmen]] will be able to build self-determined lives, if they get the necessary support.<ref>{{citation|title=Life among the Contrabands|language=en|url=https://docsouth.unc.edu/fpn/jacobs/support5.html|access-date=December 22, 2019\n}}. Summary of the report in: Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;159\u2013161.</ref>\n\nDuring the fall of 1862, she traveled through the North using her popularity as author of ''Incidents'' to build up a network to support her relief work.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;161-162.</ref> The ''New York Friends'' (i.e. the [[Quakers]]) gave her credentials as a relief agent.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;164.</ref>\n\nFrom January 1863, she made Alexandria the center of her activity. Together with Quaker [[Julia Wilbur]], the teacher, feminist and abolitionist, whom she had already known in Rochester, she was distributing clothes and blankets and at the same time struggling with incompetent, corrupt, or openly racist authorities.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;164\u2013174.</ref>\n\nWhile doing relief work in Alexandria, Jacobs was also involved in the political world. In May 1863 she attended the yearly conference of the New England Anti-Slavery Society in Boston. Together with the other participants she watched the parade of the newly created [[54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment]],<ref>For the symbolic and political value of this regiment cf. David W. Blight, Frederick Douglass. Prophet of Freedom. New York 2018, pp.&nbsp;388\u2013402, especially p.&nbsp;398.</ref> consisting of black soldiers led by white officers. Since the Lincoln administration had declined to use African American soldiers only a few months past, this was a highly symbolic event. Jacobs expressed her joy and pride in a letter to Lydia Maria Child: \"How my heart swelled with the thought that my poor oppressed race were to strike a blow for freedom !\" <ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;168\u2013169.</ref>\n\n==== The Jacobs School ====\n[[File:Jacobs School 1864.jpg|thumb|left|Harriet and Louisa Matilda Jacobs and their students in front of the Jacobs School, Alexandria, Virginia, 1864]]\nIn most slave states, teaching slaves to read and write had been forbidden. Virginia had even prohibited teaching these skills to free blacks. After Union troops occupied Alexandria in 1861, some schools for blacks emerged, but there was not a single free school under African American control. Jacobs supported a project conceived by the black community in 1863 to found a new school. In the fall of 1863 her daughter Louisa Matilda who had been trained as a teacher, came to Alexandria in the company of Virginia Lawton, a black friend of the Jacobs family. After some struggle with white missionaries from the North who wanted to take control of the school, the ''Jacobs School'' opened in January 1864 under Louisa Matilda's leadership. In the ''National Anti-Slavery Standard'', Harriet Jacobs explained that it was not disapproval of white teachers that made her fight for the school being controlled by the black community. But she wanted to help the former slaves, who had been raised \"to look upon the white race as their natural superiors and masters\", to develop \"respect for their race\".<ref>H.Jacobs to L.M.Child, published in ''National Anti-Slavery Standard'', entitled {{citation|title=Letter from Teachers of the Freedmen|date=April 16, 1864|language=en|url=https://docsouth.unc.edu/fpn/jacobs/support4.html|access-date=December 31, 2019\n}}; cf. Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;177. For the context, pp.&nbsp;176-178.</ref>\n\nJacobs's work in Alexandria was recognized on the local as well as on the national level, especially in abolitionist circles. In the spring of 1864 she was elected to the executive committee of the ''[[Women's Loyal National League]]'', a women's organization founded in 1863 in response to an appeal by [[Susan B. Anthony]] which aimed at collecting signatures for a [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|constitutional amendment]] to abolish slavery.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;175\u2013176.</ref> On August 1, 1864 she delivered the speech on occasion of the celebration of the [[Emancipation of the British West Indies|British West Indian Emancipation]]<ref>A celebration introduced by the abolitionists in order to demonstrate the backwardness of the US in comparison with the British colonies.</ref> in front of the African American soldiers of a military hospital in Alexandria. Many abolitionists, among them Frederick Douglass,<ref>David W. Blight, Frederick Douglass. Prophet of Freedom. New York 2018, p.&nbsp;418. This is the only time Jacobs is mentioned in this book, while Douglass is mentioned on 30 different pages in Yellin, Harriet Jacobs (according to the index).</ref> stopped over in Alexandria while touring the South in order to see Jacobs and her work.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;181\u2013183.</ref> On a personal level, she found her labors highly rewarding. Already in December 1862 she had written to Amy Post that the preceding six months had been the happiest in her whole life.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;162, cf. p.&nbsp;167.</ref>\n\n==== Relief work with freedmen in Savannah ====\n[[File:Nast on Andrew Johnson.jpg|thumb|left|Cartoon of [[Andrew Johnson]], depicting the President disbanding the [[Freedmen's Bureau]].]]\n[[File:Visit of the Ku-Klux 1872.jpg|thumb|right|Terror by the Ku-Klux-Klan, engraving published in [[Harper's Weekly]], February 1872]]\nMother and daughter Jacobs continued their relief work in Alexandria until after the victory of the Union. Convinced that the freedmen in Alexandria were able to care for themselves,<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;186.</ref> they followed the call of the ''New England Freedmen's Aid Society'' for teachers to help instruct the freedmen in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. They arrived in [[Savannah, Georgia]] in November 1865, only 11 months after the slaves there had been freed by [[Sherman's March to the Sea]]. During the following months they distributed clothes, opened a school and were planning to start an orphanage and an asylum for old people.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;190\u2013194.</ref>\n\nBut the political situation had changed: Lincoln had been assassinated and his successor [[Andrew Johnson]] was a Southerner and former slaveholder. He ordered the removal of many freedmen from the land which had been allotted to them by the army just one year before. The land question together with the unjust labor contracts forced on the former slaves by the former masters with the help of the army, are an important subject in Jacobs's reports from Georgia.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;191\u2013195.</ref>\n\nAlready in July 1866, mother and daughter Jacobs left Savannah which was more and more suffering from anti-black violence. Once again, Harriet Jacobs went to Idlewild, to assist Cornelia Willis in caring for her dying husband until his death in January 1867.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;200\u2013202.</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1867, she visited the widow of her uncle Mark who was the only survivor of the family still living in Edenton. At the end of the year she untertook her last journey to Great Britain in order to collect money for the projected orphanage and asylum in Savannah. But after her return she had to realize that the anti-black terror in Georgia by the [[Ku-Klux-Klan]] and other groups rendered these projects impossible. The money collected was given to the asylum fund of the ''New York Friends''.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;210-211, 217 and note on p.&nbsp;345.</ref>\n\nIn the 1860s a personal tragedy occurred: In the early 1850s, her son Joseph had gone to California to [[California Gold Rush|search for gold]] together with his uncle John. Later the two had continued on to Australia. John S. Jacobs later went to England, while Joseph stayed in Australia. Some time later, no more letters reached Jacobs from Australia. Using her connections to Australian clergymen, Child had an appeal on behalf of her friend read in Australian churches, but to no avail. Jacobs never again heard of her son.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;224-225.</ref>\n\n===Later years and death===\n[[File:HarrietJacobsGrave.jpg|thumb|right|Grave of Harriet Jacobs]]\nAfter her return from England, Jacobs retired to private life. In [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], she kept a [[boarding house]] together with her daughter. Among her boarders were faculty members of nearby [[Harvard University]]. In 1873, her brother John S. returned to the U.S. together with his English wife, their son Joseph and two stepchildren to live close to his sister in Cambridge. He died in December of the same year, 1873. In 1877 Harriet and Louisa Jacobs moved to Washington, D.C., where Louisa hoped to get work as a teacher. However, she found work only for short periods. Mother and daughter again took to keeping a boarding house, until in 1887/88 Harriet Jacobs became too sick to continue with the boarding house. Mother and daughter took on odd jobs and were supported by friends, among them Cornelia Willis. Harriet Jacobs died on March 7, 1897 in Washington, D.C., and was buried at [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]] in Cambridge next to her brother. Her tombstone reads, \"Patient in tribulation, fervent in spirit serving the Lord\". (Cf. [[Epistle to the Romans]], 12:11-12)<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;217\u2013261.</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nPrior to [[Jean Fagan Yellin]]'s research in the 1980s, the accepted academic opinion, voiced by such historians as [[John Blassingame]], was that ''[[Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl]]'' was a fictional novel written by [[Lydia Maria Child]]. However, Yellin found and used a variety of historical documents, including from the [[Amy Post]] papers at the University of Rochester, state and local historical societies, and the Horniblow and Norcom papers at the North Carolina state archives, to establish both that Harriet Jacobs was the true author of ''Incidents,'' and that the narrative was her autobiography, not a work of fiction. Her edition of ''Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl'' was published in 1987 with the endorsement of Professor John Blassingame.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin, Harriet Jacobs: A Life. New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;xv-xx; Yellin, Jean Fagan and others, eds., The Harriet Jacobs Family Papers, 2 vols. (Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 2008), p.&nbsp;xxiii.</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Yellin published an exhaustive biography (394 pages) entitled ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life''. Yellin also conceived of the idea of the Harriet Jacobs Papers Project. In 2000, an advisory board for the project was established, and after funding was awarded, the project began on a full-time basis in September 2002. Of the approximately 900 documents by, to, and about Harriet Jacobs, her brother John S. Jacobs, and her daughter Louisa Matilda Jacobs amassed by the Project, over 300 were published in 2008 in a two volume edition entitled ''The Harriet Jacobs Family Papers''.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin, Harriet Jacobs: A Life.

Reynolds]] states that ''Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl'' \"and ''Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave'' are commonly viewed as the two most important slave narratives.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/11/books/to-be-a-slave.html| title=To Be a Slave| work=the New York Times| author= David S.

In the inter-war years, these nationalist movements grew and often clashed with the colonial authorities when they demanded [[self-determination]].\n\n== 20th-century Southeast Asia ==\n\n=== Japanese invasion and occupations ===\n{{Further |Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere|List of territories occupied by Imperial Japan|South-East Asian theatre of World War II|Pacific War}}\n[[File:Japanese light tanks moving toward Manila.jpg|thumb|right|Japanese imperial army entering [[Manila]], January 1942.]]\nIn September 1940, following the [[Fall of France]] and pursuant to the Pacific war goals of [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]], the [[Japanese Imperial Army]]  invaded [[Japanese invasion of French Indochina|Vichy French Indochina]], which ended in the abortive [[Japanese coup de main in French Indochina]] of 9 March 1945. On 5 January 1941, Thailand launched the [[Franco-Thai War]], ended on 9 May 1941 by a Japanese-imposed treaty signed in Tokyo.<ref>[http://www.ww2f.com/topic/12620-vichy-versus-asia-the-franco-siamese-war-of-1941/ Vichy versus Asia: The Franco-Siamese War of 1941]</ref> On 7/8 December, Japan's entry into [[World War II]] began with the [[Thailand in World War II|invasion of Thailand]], the only invaded country to maintain nominal independence, due to her political and military alliance with the Japanese\u2014on 10 May 1942, her northwestern [[Phayap Army|Payap Army]] invaded Burma during the [[Burma Campaign]]. From 1941 until war's end, Japanese [[Japanese occupation of Cambodia|occupied Cambodia]], [[Japanese occupation of Malaya|Malaya]], and the Philippines, which ended in independence movements. [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines#The occupation|Japanese occupation of the Philippines]] led to the forming of the [[Second Philippine Republic]], formally dissolved in Tokyo on 17 August 1945. Also on 17 August, a [[proclamation of Indonesian Independence]] was read at the conclusion of [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies]] since March 1942.\n\n===Post-war decolonisation===\n[[File:Bruce Crandall's UH-1D.jpg|thumb|right|Combat operations at Ia Drang Valley, during [[Vietnam War]], November 1965.]]\n\nWith the rejuvenated nationalist movements in wait, the Europeans returned to a very different Southeast Asia after [[World War II]]. [[Indonesia]] [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|declared independence]] on 17 August 1945 and subsequently [[Indonesian National Revolution|fought a bitter war]] against the returning Dutch; the Philippines was granted independence by the United States in 1946; Burma secured their independence from Britain in 1948, and the [[France|French]] were driven from [[Indochina]] in 1954 after a bitterly fought war (the [[Indochina War]]) against the Vietnamese nationalists. The [[United Nations]] provided a forum for nationalism, post-independent self-definition, nation-building and the acquisition of territorial integrity for many newly independent nations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://projectsoutheastasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/SEAS2012_OpeningPanel-Papers.pdf |title=Some reflections on Southeast Asia and its position in academia  |publisher=Project Southeast Asia |date=  |author=Tom G.

After suppressing the communist insurrection during the [[Malayan Emergency]] from 1948 to 1960, Britain granted independence to [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]] and later, [[Singapore]], [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] in 1957 and 1963 respectively within the framework of the [[Malaysia|Federation of Malaysia]]. In one of the most bloody single incidents of violence in Cold War Southeast Asia, General Suharto [[Overthrow of Sukarno|seized power in Indonesia]] in 1965 and initiated [[Indonesian mass killings of 1965\u20131966|a massacre]] of approximately 500,000 alleged members of the [[Communist Party of Indonesia]] (PKI).\n\nFollowing the independence of the [[Indochina]] states with the [[battle of Dien Bien Phu]], [[North Vietnam]]ese attempts to conquer [[South Vietnam]] resulted in the [[Vietnam War]]. The conflict spread to [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]] and heavy intervention from the [[United States]]. By the war's end in 1975, all these countries were controlled by communist parties. After the communist victory, two wars between communist states\u2014the [[Cambodian\u2013Vietnamese War]] of 1975\u201389 and the [[Sino-Vietnamese War]] of 1979\u2014were fought in the region. The victory of the [[Khmer Rouge]] in Cambodia resulted in the [[Cambodian genocide]].<ref>Frey, Rebecca Joyce (2009).

Malden, Massachusetts: Blackwell Publishing</ref>\n\nIn 1975, Portuguese rule ended in East Timor. However, independence was short-lived as Indonesia [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|annexed the territory]] soon after. However, after more than [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|20 years of fighting Indonesia]], East Timor won its independence and was recognised by the UN in 2002. Finally, Britain ended its protectorate of the Sultanate of [[Brunei]] in 1984, marking the end of European rule in Southeast Asia.\n\n==Contemporary Southeast Asia==\n[[File:ASEAN Nations Flags in Jakarta 3.jpg|thumb|right|[[ASEAN]] members' flags in [[Jakarta]].]]\nModern Southeast Asia has been characterised by high economic growth by most countries and closer regional integration. [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]], [[Singapore]] and [[Thailand]] have traditionally experienced high growth and are commonly recognised as the more developed countries of the region. As of late, [[Vietnam]] too had been experiencing an economic boom. However, [[Myanmar]], [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]] and the newly independent [[East Timor]] are still lagging economically.\n\nOn 8 August 1967, the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) was founded by Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines. Since Cambodian admission into the union in 1999, East Timor is the only Southeast Asian country that is not part of ASEAN, although plans are under way for eventual membership. The association aims to enhance co-operation among Southeast Asian community. [[ASEAN Free Trade Area]] has been established to encourage greater trade among ASEAN members. ASEAN has also been a front runner in greater integration of Asia-Pacific region through [[East Asia Summit]]s.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Buddhism in Southeast Asia]]\n* [[Hinduism in Southeast Asia]]\n* [[Islam in Southeast Asia]]\n* [[Greater India]]\n* [[Two Layer hypothesis]]\n* [[History of Brunei]]\n* [[History of Cambodia]]\n* [[History of East Timor]]\n* [[History of Indonesia]]\n* [[History of Laos]]\n* [[History of Malaysia]]\n* [[History of Myanmar]]\n* [[History of the Philippines]]\n* [[History of Singapore]]\n* [[History of Thailand]]\n* [[History of Vietnam]]\n* [[History of Asia]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book|authorlink=Robin Dennell|last=Dennell|first=Robin|year=2010|chapter='Out of Africa I': Current Problems and Future Prospects|title=Out of Africa I: The First Hominin Colonization of Eurasia|series=Vertebrate Paleobiology and Paleoanthropology Series|editor-first=John G.|editor-last=Fleagle|display-editors=etal|location=Dordrecht|pages=247\u201374|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-90-481-9036-2|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal|authorlink=Mike Morwood|last=Morwood|first=M.
