{"title_page": "Deaths in 2020", "text_new": "{{pp-vandalism|small=yes}}\n{{Short description|List of notable individuals who died in 2020}}\nThe following deaths of notable individuals occurred in 2020. Names are reported under the date of death, in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\nA typical entry reports information in the following sequence:\n\n* Name, age, country of citizenship at birth, subsequent [[nationality]] (if applicable), what subject was noted for, cause of death (if known), and reference.\n\n<!--\n* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines below when adding a name to this article. * * * * * * *\n\nA typical entry reports information in the following sequence: Name, age, country of citizenship at birth or nationality if the subject is not eligible (for example, in the case of animals), subsequent nationality (if applicable), what subject was noted for, cause of death (if known), and reference. Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death. Names under each date are reported in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\n(1) Please add only those meeting Wikipedia notability guidelines. Include a reference to a reliable source.[a] [b] If a Wikipedia article for the dead does not yet exist, reconsider whether the subject is actually notable. If so, consider writing an article yourself. Those without a Wikipedia article are removed after one month.\n\n(2) Please understand that the intent of this article is to report notable deaths. Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily render the dead \"notable\". If you report the death of a notable subject that does not already have a Wikipedia article, consider starting one. Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\". Thank you.\n\n(4) References should be in <ref>[url & title]</ref> format, as full citations make the page too slow to load, and too big to edit.\n\n--Notes--\n[a] See [[WP:RS]] for definition of reliable source, and [[WP:BLPSOURCE]] for living and recently deceased persons.\n[b] For information on using information from Ancestry.com, Find-a-grave, or IMDb, please see [[WP:ELPEREN]].\n* * * *

As the name implies, many of the concepts, data structures, and algorithms are directly analogous to [[signal processing]] and [[image processing]]. For example, where [[image smoothing]] might convolve an intensity signal with a blur kernel formed using the [[Laplace operator]], [[Laplacian smoothing|geometric smoothing]] might be achieved by convolving a [[Surface (mathematics)|surface]] geometry with a blur kernel formed using the [[Laplace-Beltrami operator]].\n\nApplications of geometry processing algorithms already cover a wide range of areas from [[multimedia]], [[entertainment]] and classical [[computer-aided design]], to biomedical computing, [[reverse engineering]], and [[scientific computing]].<ref name=PMP2010>\n{{cite book |last=Botsch |first=Mario|last2= Kobbelt |first2=Leif |last3= Pauly |first3=Mark |last4= Alliez |first4=Pierre |date=2010 |title=Polygon Mesh Processing |url= |location= |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |page= |isbn=9781568814261 |author-link= }}</ref>\n\nGeometry processing is a common research topic at [[SIGGRAPH]], the premier [[computer graphics]] academic conference, and the main topic of the annual [[Symposium on Geometry Processing]].\n\n== Geometry processing as a life cycle ==\n[[File:Cactus Gaussian Curvature.png|thumb|A mesh of a cactus showing the Gaussian Curvature at each vertex, using the angle defect method.]]\n\nGeometry processing involves working with a [[shape]], usually in 2D or 3D, although the shape can live in a space of arbitrary dimensions. The processing of a shape involves three stages, which is known as its life cycle. At its \"birth,\" a shape can be instantiated through one of three methods: a [[3D modeling|model]], a [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical representation]], or a [[3D scanner|scan]]. After a shape is born, it can be analyzed and edited repeatedly in a cycle. This usually involves acquiring different measurements, such as the distances between the points of the shape, the smoothness of the shape, or its [[Euler characteristic]]. Editing may involve denoising, deforming, or performing [[rigid transformation]]s. At the final stage of the shape's \"life,\" it is consumed. This can mean it is consumed by a viewer as a rendered asset in a game or movie, for instance. The end of a shape's life can also be defined by a decision about the shape, like whether or not it satisfies some criteria. Or it can even be [[Digital modeling and fabrication|fabricated]] in the real world, through a method such as 3D printing or laser cutting.\n\n== Discrete Representation of a Shape ==\nLike any other shape, the shapes used in geometry processing have properties pertaining to their [[geometry]] and [[topology]]. The geometry of a shape concerns the position of the shape's [[Euclidean space|points in space]], [[tangent]]s, [[Normal (geometry)|normals]], and [[curvature]]. It also includes the dimension in which the shape lives (ex. <math>R^2</math> or <math>R^3</math>). The [[topology]] of a shape is a collection of properties that do not change even after smooth transformations have been applied to the shape. It concerns dimensions such as the number of [[Holes (topology)|holes]] and [[Boundary (topology)|boundaries]], as well as the [[orientability]] of the shape. One example of a non-orientable shape is the [[M\u00f6bius strip|Mobius strip]].\n\nIn computers, everything must be discretized. Shapes in geometry processing are usually represented as [[triangle mesh]]es, which can be seen as a [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]. Each node in the graph is a vertex (usually in <math>R^3</math>), which has a position. This encodes the geometry of the shape. Directed edges connect these vertices into triangles, which by the right hand rule, then have a direction called the normal. Each triangle forms a face of the mesh. These are combinatoric in nature and encode the topology of the shape. In addition to triangles, a more general class of [[polygon mesh]]es can also be used to represent a shape. More advanced representations like [[progressive meshes]] encode a coarse representation along with a sequence of transformations, which produce a fine or high resolution representation of the shape once applied. These meshes are useful in a variety of applications, including geomorphs, progressive transmission, mesh compression, and selective refinement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hhoppe.com/pm.pdf|title=Progressive Meshes|author=Hugues Hoppe}}</ref>\n[[File:Mesh bunny.png|left|thumb|274x274px|A mesh of the famous Stanford bunny. Shapes are usually represented as a mesh, a collection of polygons that delineate the contours of the shape.]]\n\n=== Properties of a shape ===\n==== Euler Characteristic ====\nOne particularly important property of a 3D shape is its [[Euler characteristic]], which can alternatively be defined in terms of its [[Genus (mathematics)|genus]]. The formula for this in the continuous sense is <math>\\chi= 2c - 2h - b</math>, where <math>c</math> is the number of connected components, <math>h</math> is number of holes (as in donut holes, see [[torus]]), and <math>b</math> is the number of connected components of the boundary of the surface. A concrete example of this is a mesh of a pair of [[Pair of pants (mathematics)|pants]]. There is one connected component, 0 holes, and 3 connected components of the boundary (the waist and two leg holes). So in this case, the Euler characteristic is -1. To bring this into the discrete world, the Euler characteristic of a mesh is computed in terms of its vertices, edges, and faces. <math>\\chi = |V| - |E| + |F|</math>.\n\n[[File:Pants mesh.png|thumb|This image shows a mesh of a pair of pants, with Euler characteristic -1. This is explained by the equation to compute the characteristic: 2c - 2h - b. The mesh has 1 connected component, 0 topological holes, and 3 boundaries (the waist hole and each leg hole): 2 - 0 - 3 = -1.]]\n\n== Surface reconstruction ==\n=== Poisson reconstruction from surface points to mesh ===\n[[File:Mesh reconstruction.gif|thumb|339x339px|A triangle mesh is constructed out of a [[point cloud]]. Sometimes shapes are initialized only as \"point clouds,\" a collection of sampled points from the shape's surface. Often, these point clouds need to be converted to meshes.|left]]\nDepending on how a shape is initialized or \"birthed,\" the shape might exist only as a nebula of sampled points that represent its surface in space. To transform the surface points into a mesh, the Poisson reconstruction<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://hhoppe.com/proj/poissonrecon/|title=Poisson surface reconstruction|website=hhoppe.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-01-26}}</ref> strategy can be employed. This method states that the [[indicator function]], a function that determines which points in space belong to the surface of the shape, can actually be computed from the sampled points. The key concept is that gradient of the indicator function is ''0'' everywhere, except at the sampled points, where it is equal to the inward surface normal. More formally, suppose the collection of sampled points from the surface is denoted by <math>S</math>, each point in the space by <math>p_i</math>, and the corresponding normal at that point by <math>n_i</math>. Then the gradient of the indicator function is defined as:\n\n<math>\\triangledown g = \\begin{cases} \\textbf{n}_i, & \\forall p_i \\in S \\\\ 0, & \\text{otherwise}\\end{cases}</math>\n\nThe task of reconstruction then becomes a [[Calculus of variations|variational]] problem. To find the indicator function of the surface, we must find a function <math>\\chi</math> such that <math>\\lVert \\triangledown \\chi - \\textbf{V} \\rVert</math> is minimized, where <math>\\textbf{V}</math> is the vector field defined by the samples. As a variational problem, one can view the minimizer <math>\\chi </math>as a solution of [[Poisson's equation]].<ref name=\":0\" /> After obtaining a good approximation for <math>\\chi </math> and a value <math>\\sigma</math>  for which the points <math>(x,y,z)</math> with <math>\\chi(x,y,z)= \\sigma</math> lie on the surface to be reconstructed, the [[marching cubes]] algorithm can be used to construct a [[triangle mesh]] from the function  <math>\\chi </math> , which can then be applied in subsequent computer graphics applications.\n\n== Registration ==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width = \n| image1 = Point-to-point-registration.gif\n | alt1 = Point to point registration\n | caption1 = An animation depicting registration of a partial mesh onto a complete mesh, with piecewise constant approximation of the projection function.\n | image2 = Point-to-Plane Registration.gif\n | alt2 = Point to plane registration\n | caption2 = An animation depicting the same registration procedure as above, but with piecewise linear approximation of the projection function. Note that it converges much faster.\n}}\n\nOne common problem encountered in geometry processing is how to merge multiple views of a single object captured from different angles or positions. This problem is known as [[Point set registration|registration]]. In registration, we wish to find an optimal [[rigid transformation]] that will align surface <math>X</math> with surface <math>Y</math>. More formally, if <math>P_Y(x)</math> is the projection of a point ''x'' from surface <math>X</math> onto surface <math>Y</math>, we want to find the optimal rotation matrix <math>R</math> and translation vector <math>t</math> that minimize the following objective function:\n\n<math>\\int_{x \\in X}||Rx + t - P_Y(x)|| dx</math>\n\nWhile rotations are non-linear in general, small rotations can be linearized as skew-symmetric matrices. Moreover, the distance function <math>x - P_Y(x)</math> is non-linear, but is amenable to linear approximations if the change in <math>X</math> is small. An iterative solution such as [[Iterative closest point|Iterative Closest Point (ICP)]] is therefore employed to solve for small transformations iteratively, instead of solving for the potentially large transformation in one go. In ICP, ''n'' random sample points from <math>X</math> are chosen and projected onto <math>Y</math>. In order to sample points uniformly at random across the surface of the triangle mesh, the random sampling is broken into two stages: uniformly sampling points within a triangle; and non-uniformly sampling triangles, such that each triangle's associated probability is proportional to its surface area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcl-users.org/file/n4037867/Rusinkiewicz_Effcient_Variants_of_ICP.pdf|title=Efficient Variants of the ICP Algorithm|author=Szymon Rusinkiewicz, Marc Levoy}}</ref> Thereafter, the optimal transformation is calculated based on the difference between each <math>x</math> and its projection. In the following iteration, the projections are calculated based on the result of applying the previous transformation on the samples. The process is repeated until convergence.\n\n== Smoothing ==\nWhen shapes are defined or scanned, there may be accompanying noise, either to a signal acting upon the surface or to the actual surface geometry. Reducing noise on the former is known as [[Noise reduction|data denoising]], while noise reduction on the latter is known as [[surface fairing]]. The task of geometric smoothing is analogous to signal noise reduction, and consequently employs similar approaches.\n\nThe pertinent Lagrangian to be minimized is derived by recording the conformity to the initial signal <math>\\bar f</math> and the smoothness of the resulting signal, which approximated by the magnitude of the gradient with a weight <math>\\lambda</math>:\n\n<math>\\mathcal{L}(f) = \\int_{\\Omega}\\|f - \\bar f\\|^2 + \\lambda \\|\\nabla f\\|^2 dx</math>.\n\nTaking a variation <math>\\delta f</math> on <math>\\mathcal{L}</math> emits the necessary condition\n\n<math>0 = \\delta\\mathcal{L}(f) = \\int_{\\Omega}\\delta f(\\mathbf{I} + \\lambda \\nabla^2) f - \\delta f \\bar f dx</math>.\n\nBy discretizing this onto piecewise-constant elements with our signal on the vertices we obtain\n\n<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\sum_{i} M_i \\delta f_i \\bar f_i &=  \\sum_i M_i\\delta f_i \\sum_j (\\mathbf{I} + \\lambda \\nabla^2) f_j =  \\sum_i \\delta f_i \\sum_j (M + \\lambda M\\nabla^2) f_j,\n\\end{align}\n</math>[[File:Noisy sphere.gif|thumb|A noisy sphere being iteratively smoothed.|273x273px|left]]where our choice of <math>\\nabla^2</math> is chosen to be <math>M^{-1}\\mathbf{L}</math> for the cotangent Laplacian <math>\\mathbf{L}</math> and the <math>M^{-1}</math> term is to map the image of the Laplacian from areas to points.

This process is known as [[Mesh parameterization|parameterization]]. The goal is to find coordinates ''u'' and ''v'' onto which we can map the surface so that distortions are minimized. In this manner, parameterization can be seen as an optimization problem. One of the major applications of mesh parameterization is [[texture mapping]].\n\n=== Mass springs method ===\n[[File:Tutte Embedding on Beetle.gif|thumb|378x378px|The Tutte Embedding shows non-smooth parameterizations on the side of the beetle.]]\nOne way to measure the distortion accrued in the mapping process is to measure how much the length of the edges on the 2D mapping differs from their lengths in the original 3D surface. In more formal terms, the objective function can be written as:\n\n<math>\\underset{U}{\\text{min}} \\sum_{ij \\in E} ||u_i - u_j||^2</math>\n\nWhere <math>E</math> is the set of mesh edges and <math>U</math> is the set of vertices. However, optimizing this objective function would result in a solution that maps all of the vertices to a single vertex in the ''uv''-coordinates. Borrowing an idea from graph theory, we apply the [[Tutte embedding|Tutte Mapping]] and restrict the boundary vertices of the mesh onto a unit circle or other [[convex polygon]]. Doing so prevents the vertices from collapsing into a single vertex when the mapping is applied. The non-boundary vertices are then positioned at the [[Barycentric coordinate system|barycentric interpolation]] of their neighbours. The Tutte Mapping, however, still suffers from severe distortions as it attempts to make the edge lengths equal, and hence does not correctly account for the triangle sizes on the actual surface mesh.\n\n=== Least-squares conformal mappings ===\n[[File:Tutte Vs LSCM .gif|left|thumb|394x394px|A comparison of the Tutte Embedding and Least-Squares-Conformal-Mapping parameterization. Notice how the LSCM parameterization is smooth on the side of the beetle.]]\nAnother way to measure the distortion is to consider the [[Differential calculus|variations]] on the ''u'' and ''v'' coordinate functions. The wobbliness and distortion apparent in the mass springs methods are due to high variations in the ''u'' and ''v'' coordinate functions. With this approach, the objective function becomes the [[Dirichlet's energy|Dirichlet energy]] on ''u'' and ''v:''\n\n<math>\\underset{u,v}{\\text{min}} \\int_S ||\\nabla u||^2 + ||\\nabla v||^2 dA</math>\n\nThere are a few other things to consider. We would like to minimize the angle distortion to [[Conformal map|preserve orthogonality]]. That means we would like <math>\\nabla u = \\nabla v^{\\perp}</math>. In addition, we would also like the mapping to have proportionally similar sized regions as the original. This results to setting the Jacobian of the ''u'' and ''v'' coordinate functions to 1.\n\n<math>\\begin{bmatrix}\n  \\dfrac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} & \\dfrac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\\\[1em]\n  \\dfrac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} & \\dfrac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} \\end{bmatrix}\n= 1</math>\n\nPutting these requirements together, we can augment the Dirichlet energy so that our objective function becomes:<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Desbrun|first=Mathieu|year=2002|title=Intrinsic Parameterizations of Surface Meshes|url=http://www.geometry.caltech.edu/pubs/DMA02.pdf|journal=Eurographics|volume=21|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Levy|first=Bruno|year=2002|title=Least squares conformal maps for automatic texture atlas generation|url=https://members.loria.fr/Bruno.Levy/papers/LSCM_SIGGRAPH_2002.pdf|journal=ACM Transactions on Graphics |volume=21|issue=3|pages=362\u2013371|via=|doi=10.1145/566654.566590}}</ref>\n\n<math>\\underset{u,v}{\\text{min}} \\int_S \\frac{1}{2} ||\\nabla u||^2 + \\frac{1}{2} ||\\nabla v||^2 - \\nabla u \\cdot \\nabla v^{\\perp} </math>\n\nTo avoid the problem of having all the vertices mapped to a single point, we also require that the solution to the optimization problem must have a non-zero norm and that it is orthogonal to the trivial solution.\n\n== Deformation ==\n[[File:Asrigidaspossible-man.gif|thumb|394x394px|An example of as-rigid-as-possible deformation.]]\nDeformation is concerned with transforming some rest shape to a new shape. Typically, these transformations are continuous and do not alter the topology of the shape. Modern mesh-based shape deformation methods satisfy user deformation constraints at handles (selected vertices or regions on the mesh) and propagate these handle deformations to the rest of shape smoothly and without removing or distorting details. Some common forms of interactive deformations are point-based, skeleton-based, and cage-based.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Jacobson|first1=Alec|last2=Baran|first2=Ilya|last3=Popovi\u0107|first3=Jovan|last4=[[Olga_Sorkine-Hornung|Sorkine]]|first4=Olga|year=2011|title=Bounded Biharmonic Weights for Real-Time Deformation|url=https://igl.ethz.ch/projects/bbw/bounded-biharmonic-weights-siggraph-2011-jacobson-et-al.pdf|journal=ACM Transactions on Graphics|volume=30|issue=4|pages=1|doi=10.1145/2010324.1964973}}</ref> In point-based deformation, a user can apply transformations to small set of points, called handles, on the shape. Skeleton-based deformation defines a [[skeleton]] for the shape, which allows a user to move the bones and rotate the joints. Cage-based deformation requires a cage to be drawn around all or part of a shape so that, when the user manipulates points on the cage, the volume it encloses changes accordingly.\n\n=== Point-based deformation ===\nHandles provide a sparse set of constraints for the deformation: as the user moves one point, the others must stay in place.\n\nA rest surface <math>\\hat{S}</math> [[Immersion (mathematics)|immersed]] in <math>\\R^3</math> can be described with a mapping <math>\\hat{x} : \\Omega \\rightarrow \\R^3</math>, where <math>\\Omega</math> is a 2D parametric domain. The same can be done with another mapping <math>x</math> for the transformed surface <math>S</math>. Ideally, the transformed shape adds as little distortion as possible to the original. One way to model this distortion is in terms of displacements <math>d = x - \\hat{x}</math> with a Laplacian-based energy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Marc|first=Alexa|year=2003|title=Differential coordinates for local mesh morphing and deformation|journal=The Visual Computer|volume=19|pages=105\u2013114}}</ref> Applying the Laplace operator to these mappings allows us to measure how the position of a point changes relative to its neighborhood, which keeps the handles smooth. Thus, the energy we would like to minimize can be written as:\n\n<math>\\min_{\\textbf{d}} \\int_{\\Omega} || \\Delta \\textbf{d} ||^2 dA</math>.\n\nWhile this method is translation invariant, it is unable to account for rotations. The As-Rigid-As-Possible deformation scheme<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=[[Olga_Sorkine-Hornung|Sorkine]]|first1=Olga|last2=Alexa|first2=Marc|year=2007|title=As-Rigid-As-Possible Surface Modeling|url=https://www.igl.ethz.ch/projects/ARAP/arap_web.pdf|journal=Proceedings of EUROGRAPHICS/ACM SIGGRAPH Symposium on Geometry Processing|pages=109\u2013116}}</ref> applies a rigid transformation <math>x_i = R\\hat{x_i} + t</math> to each handle i, where <math>R \\in SO(3) \\subset \\R^3</math> is a rotation matrix and <math>t \\in \\R^3</math> is a translation vector. Unfortunately, there's no way to know the rotations in advance, so instead we pick a \u201cbest\u201d rotation that minimizes displacements. To achieve local rotation invariance, however, requires a function <math>\\textbf{R} : \\Omega \\rightarrow SO(3)</math> which outputs the best rotation for every point on the surface. The resulting energy, then, must optimize over both <math>\\textbf{x}</math> and <math>\\textbf{R}</math>:\n\n<math>\\min_{\\textbf{x,R} \\in SO(3)} \\int_{\\Omega} || \\nabla \\textbf{x} - \\textbf{R} \\nabla \\hat{\\textbf{x}} ||^2 dA</math>\n\nNote that the translation vector is not present in the final objective function because translations have constant gradient.\n\n== Inside-Outside Segmentation ==\nWhile seemingly trivial, in many cases, determining the inside from the outside of a triangle mesh is not an easy problem. In general, given a surface <math>S</math> we pose this problem as determining a function <math>isInside(q)</math> which will return <math>1</math> if the point <math>q</math> is inside <math>S</math>, and <math>0</math> otherwise.\n\nIn the simplest case, the shape is closed. In this case, to determine if a point <math>q</math> is inside or outside the surface, we can cast a ray <math>r</math> in any direction from a query point, and count the number of times <math>count_r</math> it passes through the surface. If <math>q</math> was outside <math>S</math> then the ray must either not pass through <math>S</math> (in which case <math>count_r = 0</math>) or, each time it enters <math>S</math> it must pass through twice, because S is bounded, so any ray entering it must exit. So if <math>q</math> is outside, <math>count_r</math> is even. Likewise if <math>q</math> is inside, the same logic applies to the previous case, but the ray must intersect <math>S</math> one extra time for the first time it leaves <math>S</math>. So:\n\n<math>\nisInside_r(q) = \\left\\{\n        \\begin{array}{ll}\n            1 & count_r \\ is \\ odd \\\\\n            0 & count_r \\ is \\ even\\\\\n        \\end{array}\n    \\right.\n</math>\n\nNow, oftentimes we cannot guarantee that the <math>S</math> is closed. Take the pair of pants example from the top of this article. This mesh clearly has a semantic inside-and-outside, despite there being holes at the waist and the legs.\n\n[[File:Point shooting.gif|thumb|Approximating inside-outside segmentation by shooting rays from a query point for varying number of rays.]]\n\nThe naive attempt to solve this problem is to shoot many rays in random directions, and classify <math>q</math> as being inside if and only if most of the rays intersected <math>S</math> an odd number of times. To quantify this, let us say we cast <math>k</math> rays, <math>r_1,r_2,\\dots,r_k</math>. We associate a number <math>rayTest(q) = \\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{i=1}^{k} isInside_{r_i}(q)</math> which is the average value of <math>isInside_r</math> from each ray. Therefore:\n\n<math>\nisInside(q) = \\left\\{\n        \\begin{array}{ll}\n            1 & rayTest(q) \\geq 0.5 \\\\\n            0 & rayTest(q) < 0.5\\\\\n        \\end{array}\n    \\right.\n</math>\n\nIn the limit of shooting many, many rays, this method handles open meshes, however it in order to become accurate, far too many rays are required for this method to be computationally ideal. Instead, a more robust approach is the Generalized Winding Number.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Jacobson|first1=Alec|last2=Ladislav|first2=Kavan|last3=[[Olga_Sorkine-Hornung|Sorkine-Hornung]]|first3=Olga|year=2013|title=Robust Inside-Outside Segmentation using Generalized Winding Numbers|url=http://igl.ethz.ch/projects/winding-number/robust-inside-outside-segmentation-using-generalized-winding-numbers-siggraph-2013-jacobson-et-al.pdf|journal=ACM Transactions on Graphics |volume=32|issue=4|pages=1|via=|doi=10.1145/2461912.2461916}}</ref> Inspired by the 2D [[winding number]], this approach uses the [[solid angle]] at <math>q</math> of each triangle in the mesh to determine if <math>q</math> is inside or outside. The value of the Generalized Winding Number at <math>q</math>, <math>wn(q)</math> is proportional to the sum of the solid angle contribution from each triangle in the mesh:\n\n<math>wn(q) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\sum_{t \\in F} solidAngle(t)</math>\n\nFor a closed mesh, <math>wn(q)</math> is equivalent to the characteristic function for the volume represented by <math>S</math>. Therefore, we say:\n\n<math>\nisInside(q) = \\left\\{\n        \\begin{array}{ll}\n            1 & wn(q) \\geq 0.5 \\\\\n            0 & wn(q) < 0.5 \\\\\n        \\end{array}\n    \\right.\n</math>\n\nBecause <math>wn(q)</math> is a [[harmonic function]], it degrades gracefully, meaning the inside-outside segmentation would not change much if we poked holes in a closed mesh. For this reason, the Generalized Winding Number handles open meshes robustly. The boundary between inside and outside smoothly passes over holes in the mesh. In fact, in the limit, the Generalized Winding Number is equivalent to the ray-casting method as the number of rays goes to infinity.\n\n== Applications ==\n* [[Computer-aided design]] (CAD)\n* 3D [[#Surface reconstruction|Surface Reconstruction]], ''e.g.'' range scanners in airport security, autonomous vehicles, medical scanner data reconstruction\n* Image-to-world Registration, ''e.g.'' [[Image-guided surgery]]\n* [[Architecture]], ''e.g.'' creating, [[reverse engineering]]\n* Physics simulations\n* Computer games ''e.g.'' [[collision detection]]\n* [[Geologic modelling]]\n* [[Visualization (graphics)]] ''e.g.'' [[Information visualization]]s, [[mathematical visualization]]s\n* [[Texture mapping]]\n* [[Modelling biological systems]] ''e.g.'' muscle and bone modelling, real-time hand tracking\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Computer graphics]]\n* [[Computer-aided design]] (CAD)\n* [[Industrial CT scanning]]\n* [[List of interactive geometry software]]\n* [[Digital image processing]]\n* [[Signal processing]]\n* [[Discrete differential geometry]]\n* [[Glossary of differential geometry and topology]]\n* [[Topology]]\n* [[Calculus of variations]]\n* [[MeshLab]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.geometryprocessing.org/ Symposium on Geometry Processing]\n* [http://www.multires.caltech.edu/ Multi-Res Modeling Group], [[Caltech]] \n* [http://geom.mi.fu-berlin.de/index.html Mathematical Geometry Processing Group], [[Free University of Berlin]]\n* [http://www.graphics.rwth-aachen.de Computer Graphics Group], [[RWTH Aachen University]]\n* [http://www.pmp-book.org/ Polygon Mesh Processing Book]\n* [https://www.pmp-library.org/ Polygon Mesh Processing Library]\n* [https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/DGPDEC/ Discrete Differential Geometry: An Applied Introduction], course notes by Keenan Crane et al.\n* [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOp-ngXvomHArqntgLVNzuJNdzNx3rDjZ Video tutorials] from [[Symposium on Geometry Processing|SGP 2017]] grad school\n* [https://libigl.github.io/ libigl] geometry processing library\n\n[[Category:Geometry processing]]\n[[Category:3D imaging]]\n[[Category:3D computer graphics]]\n[[Category:Geometry]]\n[[Category:Computational geometry]]\n[[Category:Differential geometry]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Polygon_Mesh_Processing_Book_Cover.jpg|thumb|right| ''Polygon Mesh Processing'' by Mario Botsch et al. is a textbook on the topic of Geometry Processing.<ref name=PMP2010/>]]\n\n'''Geometry processing''', or [[polygon mesh|mesh]] processing, is an area of research that uses concepts from [[applied mathematics]], [[computer science]] and [[engineering]] to design efficient [[algorithm]]s for the acquisition, [[3D reconstruction|reconstruction]], analysis, manipulation, simulation and transmission of complex 3D models.  As the name implies, many of the concepts, data structures, and algorithms are directly analogous to [[signal processing]] and [[image processing]]. For example, where [[image smoothing]] might convolve an intensity signal with a blur kernel formed using the [[Laplace operator]], [[Laplacian smoothing|geometric smoothing]] might be achieved by convolving a [[Surface (mathematics)|surface]] geometry with a blur kernel formed using the [[Laplace-Beltrami operator]].\n\nApplications of geometry processing algorithms already cover a wide range of areas from [[multimedia]], [[entertainment]] and classical [[computer-aided design]], to biomedical computing, [[reverse engineering]], and [[scientific computing]].<ref name=PMP2010>\n{{cite book |last=Botsch |first=Mario|last2= Kobbelt |first2=Leif |last3= Pauly |first3=Mark |last4= Alliez |first4=Pierre |date=2010 |title=Polygon Mesh Processing |url= |location= |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |page= |isbn=9781568814261 |author-link= }}</ref>\n\nGeometry processing is a common research topic at [[SIGGRAPH]], the premier [[computer graphics]] academic conference, and the main topic of the annual [[Symposium on Geometry Processing]].\n\n== Geometry processing as a life cycle ==\n[[File:Cactus Gaussian Curvature.png|thumb|A mesh of a cactus showing the Gaussian Curvature at each vertex, using the angle defect method.]]\n\nGeometry processing involves working with a [[shape]], usually in 2D or 3D, although the shape can live in a space of arbitrary dimensions. The processing of a shape involves three stages, which is known as its life cycle. At its \"birth,\" a shape can be instantiated through one of three methods: a [[3D modeling|model]], a [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical representation]], or a [[3D scanner|scan]]. After a shape is born, it can be analyzed and edited repeatedly in a cycle. This usually involves acquiring different measurements, such as the distances between the points of the shape, the smoothness of the shape, or its [[Euler characteristic]]. Editing may involve denoising, deforming, or performing [[rigid transformation]]s. At the final stage of the shape's \"life,\" it is consumed. This can mean it is consumed by a viewer as a rendered asset in a game or movie, for instance. The end of a shape's life can also be defined by a decision about the shape, like whether or not it satisfies some criteria. Or it can even be [[Digital modeling and fabrication|fabricated]] in the real world, through a method such as 3D printing or laser cutting.\n\n== Discrete Representation of a Shape ==\nLike any other shape, the shapes used in geometry processing have properties pertaining to their [[geometry]] and [[topology]]. The geometry of a shape concerns the position of the shape's [[Euclidean space|points in space]], [[tangent]]s, [[Normal (geometry)|normals]], and [[curvature]]. It also includes the dimension in which the shape lives (ex. <math>R^2</math> or <math>R^3</math>). The [[topology]] of a shape is a collection of properties that do not change even after smooth transformations have been applied to the shape. It concerns dimensions such as the number of [[Holes (topology)|holes]] and [[Boundary (topology)|boundaries]], as well as the [[orientability]] of the shape. One example of a non-orientable shape is the [[M\u00f6bius strip|Mobius strip]].\n\nIn computers, everything must be discretized. Shapes in geometry processing are usually represented as [[triangle mesh]]es, which can be seen as a [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]. Each node in the graph is a vertex (usually in <math>R^3</math>), which has a position. This encodes the geometry of the shape. Directed edges connect these vertices into triangles, which by the right hand rule, then have a direction called the normal. Each triangle forms a face of the mesh. These are combinatoric in nature and encode the topology of the shape. In addition to triangles, a more general class of [[polygon mesh]]es can also be used to represent a shape. More advanced representations like [[progressive meshes]] encode a coarse representation along with a sequence of transformations, which produce a fine or high resolution representation of the shape once applied. These meshes are useful in a variety of applications, including geomorphs, progressive transmission, mesh compression, and selective refinement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hhoppe.com/pm.pdf|title=Progressive Meshes|author=Hugues Hoppe}}</ref>\n[[File:Mesh bunny.png|left|thumb|274x274px|A mesh of the famous Stanford bunny. Shapes are usually represented as a mesh, a collection of polygons that delineate the contours of the shape.]]\n\n=== Properties of a shape ===\n==== Euler Characteristic ====\nOne particularly important property of a 3D shape is its [[Euler characteristic]], which can alternatively be defined in terms of its [[Genus (mathematics)|genus]]. The formula for this in the continuous sense is <math>\\chi= 2c - 2h - b</math>, where <math>c</math> is the number of connected components, <math>h</math> is number of holes (as in donut holes, see [[torus]]), and <math>b</math> is the number of connected components of the boundary of the surface. A concrete example of this is a mesh of a pair of [[Pair of pants (mathematics)|pants]]. There is one connected component, 0 holes, and 3 connected components of the boundary (the waist and two leg holes). So in this case, the Euler characteristic is -1. To bring this into the discrete world, the Euler characteristic of a mesh is computed in terms of its vertices, edges, and faces. <math>\\chi = |V| - |E| + |F|</math>.\n\n[[File:Pants mesh.png|thumb|This image shows a mesh of a pair of pants, with Euler characteristic -1. This is explained by the equation to compute the characteristic: 2c - 2h - b. The mesh has 1 connected component, 0 topological holes, and 3 boundaries (the waist hole and each leg hole): 2 - 0 - 3 = -1.]]\n\n== Surface reconstruction ==\n=== Poisson reconstruction from surface points to mesh ===\n[[File:Mesh reconstruction.gif|thumb|339x339px|A triangle mesh is constructed out of a [[point cloud]]. Sometimes shapes are initialized only as \"point clouds,\" a collection of sampled points from the shape's surface. Often, these point clouds need to be converted to meshes.|left]]\nDepending on how a shape is initialized or \"birthed,\" the shape might exist only as a nebula of sampled points that represent its surface in space. To transform the surface points into a mesh, the Poisson reconstruction<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://hhoppe.com/proj/poissonrecon/|title=Poisson surface reconstruction|website=hhoppe.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-01-26}}</ref> strategy can be employed. This method states that the [[indicator function]], a function that determines which points in space belong to the surface of the shape, can actually be computed from the sampled points. The key concept is that gradient of the indicator function is ''0'' everywhere, except at the sampled points, where it is equal to the inward surface normal. More formally, suppose the collection of sampled points from the surface is denoted by <math>S</math>, each point in the space by <math>p_i</math>, and the corresponding normal at that point by <math>n_i</math>. Then the gradient of the indicator function is defined as:\n\n<math>\\triangledown g = \\begin{cases} \\textbf{n}_i, & \\forall p_i \\in S \\\\ 0, & \\text{otherwise}\\end{cases}</math>\n\nThe task of reconstruction then becomes a [[Calculus of variations|variational]] problem. To find the indicator function of the surface, we must find a function <math>\\chi</math> such that <math>\\lVert \\triangledown \\chi - \\textbf{V} \\rVert</math> is minimized, where <math>\\textbf{V}</math> is the vector field defined by the samples. As a variational problem, one can view the minimizer <math>\\chi </math>as a solution of [[Poisson's equation]].<ref name=\":0\" /> After obtaining a good approximation for <math>\\chi </math> and a value <math>\\sigma</math>  for which the points <math>(x,y,z)</math> with <math>\\chi(x,y,z)= \\sigma</math> lie on the surface to be reconstructed, the [[marching cubes]] algorithm can be used to construct a [[triangle mesh]] from the function  <math>\\chi </math> , which then be can applied in subsequent computer graphics applications.\n\n== Registration ==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width = \n| image1 = Point-to-point-registration.gif\n | alt1 = Point to point registration\n | caption1 = An animation depicting registration of a partial mesh onto a complete mesh, with piecewise constant approximation of the projection function.\n | image2 = Point-to-Plane Registration.gif\n | alt2 = Point to plane registration\n | caption2 = An animation depicting the same registration procedure as above, but with piecewise linear approximation of the projection function. Note that it converges much faster.\n}}\n\nOne common problem encountered in geometry processing is how to merge multiple views of a single object captured from different angles or positions. This problem is known as [[Point set registration|registration]]. In registration, we wish to find an optimal [[rigid transformation]] that will align surface <math>X</math> with surface <math>Y</math>. More formally, if <math>P_Y(x)</math> is the projection of a point ''x'' from surface <math>X</math> onto surface <math>Y</math>, we want to find the optimal rotation matrix <math>R</math> and translation vector <math>t</math> that minimize the following objective function:\n\n<math>\\int_{x \\in X}||Rx + t - P_Y(x)|| dx</math>\n\nWhile rotations are non-linear in general, small rotations can be linearized as skew-symmetric matrices. Moreover, the distance function <math>x - P_Y(x)</math> is non-linear, but is amenable to linear approximations if the change in <math>X</math> is small. An iterative solution such as [[Iterative closest point|Iterative Closest Point (ICP)]] is therefore employed to solve for small transformations iteratively, instead of solving for the potentially large transformation in one go. In ICP, ''n'' random sample points from <math>X</math> are chosen and projected onto <math>Y</math>. In order to sample points uniformly at random across the surface of the triangle mesh, the random sampling is broken into two stages: uniformly sampling points within a triangle; and non-uniformly sampling triangles, such that each triangle's associated probability is proportional to its surface area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcl-users.org/file/n4037867/Rusinkiewicz_Effcient_Variants_of_ICP.pdf|title=Efficient Variants of the ICP Algorithm|author=Szymon Rusinkiewicz, Marc Levoy}}</ref> Thereafter, the optimal transformation is calculated based on the difference between each <math>x</math> and its projection. In the following iteration, the projections are calculated based on the result of applying the previous transformation on the samples. The process is repeated until convergence.\n\n== Smoothing ==\nWhen shapes are defined or scanned, there may be accompanying noise, either to a signal acting upon the surface or to the actual surface geometry. Reducing noise on the former is known as [[Noise reduction|data denoising]], while noise reduction on the latter is known as [[surface fairing]]. The task of geometric smoothing is analogous to signal noise reduction, and consequently employs similar approaches.\n\nThe pertinent Lagrangian to be minimized is derived by recording the conformity to the initial signal <math>\\bar f</math> and the smoothness of the resulting signal, which approximated by the magnitude of the gradient with a weight <math>\\lambda</math>:\n\n<math>\\mathcal{L}(f) = \\int_{\\Omega}\\|f - \\bar f\\|^2 + \\lambda \\|\\nabla f\\|^2 dx</math>.\n\nTaking a variation <math>\\delta f</math> on <math>\\mathcal{L}</math> emits the necessary condition\n\n<math>0 = \\delta\\mathcal{L}(f) = \\int_{\\Omega}\\delta f(\\mathbf{I} + \\lambda \\nabla^2) f - \\delta f \\bar f dx</math>.\n\nBy discretizing this onto piecewise-constant elements with our signal on the vertices we obtain\n\n<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\sum_{i} M_i \\delta f_i \\bar f_i &=  \\sum_i M_i\\delta f_i \\sum_j (\\mathbf{I} + \\lambda \\nabla^2) f_j =  \\sum_i \\delta f_i \\sum_j (M + \\lambda M\\nabla^2) f_j,\n\\end{align}\n</math>[[File:Noisy sphere.gif|thumb|A noisy sphere being iteratively smoothed.|273x273px|left]]where our choice of <math>\\nabla^2</math> is chosen to be <math>M^{-1}\\mathbf{L}</math> for the cotangent Laplacian <math>\\mathbf{L}</math> and the <math>M^{-1}</math> term is to map the image of the Laplacian from areas to points.

This process is known as [[Mesh parameterization|parameterization]]. The goal is to find coordinates ''u'' and ''v'' onto which we can map the surface so that distortions are minimized. In this manner, parameterization can be seen as an optimization problem. One of the major applications of mesh parameterization is [[texture mapping]].\n\n=== Mass springs method ===\n[[File:Tutte Embedding on Beetle.gif|thumb|378x378px|The Tutte Embedding shows non-smooth parameterizations on the side of the beetle.]]\nOne way to measure the distortion accrued in the mapping process is to measure how much the length of the edges on the 2D mapping differs from their lengths in the original 3D surface. In more formal terms, the objective function can be written as:\n\n<math>\\underset{U}{\\text{min}} \\sum_{ij \\in E} ||u_i - u_j||^2</math>\n\nWhere <math>E</math> is the set of mesh edges and <math>U</math> is the set of vertices. However, optimizing this objective function would result in a solution that maps all of the vertices to a single vertex in the ''uv''-coordinates. Borrowing an idea from graph theory, we apply the [[Tutte embedding|Tutte Mapping]] and restrict the boundary vertices of the mesh onto a unit circle or other [[convex polygon]]. Doing so prevents the vertices from collapsing into a single vertex when the mapping is applied. The non-boundary vertices are then positioned at the [[Barycentric coordinate system|barycentric interpolation]] of their neighbours. The Tutte Mapping, however, still suffers from severe distortions as it attempts to make the edge lengths equal, and hence does not correctly account for the triangle sizes on the actual surface mesh.\n\n=== Least-squares conformal mappings ===\n[[File:Tutte Vs LSCM .gif|left|thumb|394x394px|A comparison of the Tutte Embedding and Least-Squares-Conformal-Mapping parameterization. Notice how the LSCM parameterization is smooth on the side of the beetle.]]\nAnother way to measure the distortion is to consider the [[Differential calculus|variations]] on the ''u'' and ''v'' coordinate functions. The wobbliness and distortion apparent in the mass springs methods are due to high variations in the ''u'' and ''v'' coordinate functions. With this approach, the objective function becomes the [[Dirichlet's energy|Dirichlet energy]] on ''u'' and ''v:''\n\n<math>\\underset{u,v}{\\text{min}} \\int_S ||\\nabla u||^2 + ||\\nabla v||^2 dA</math>\n\nThere are a few other things to consider. We would like to minimize the angle distortion to [[Conformal map|preserve orthogonality]]. That means we would like <math>\\nabla u = \\nabla v^{\\perp}</math>. In addition, we would also like the mapping to have proportionally similar sized regions as the original. This results to setting the Jacobian of the ''u'' and ''v'' coordinate functions to 1.\n\n<math>\\begin{bmatrix}\n  \\dfrac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} & \\dfrac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\\\[1em]\n  \\dfrac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} & \\dfrac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} \\end{bmatrix}\n= 1</math>\n\nPutting these requirements together, we can augment the Dirichlet energy so that our objective function becomes:<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Desbrun|first=Mathieu|year=2002|title=Intrinsic Parameterizations of Surface Meshes|url=http://www.geometry.caltech.edu/pubs/DMA02.pdf|journal=Eurographics|volume=21|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Levy|first=Bruno|year=2002|title=Least squares conformal maps for automatic texture atlas generation|url=https://members.loria.fr/Bruno.Levy/papers/LSCM_SIGGRAPH_2002.pdf|journal=ACM Transactions on Graphics |volume=21|issue=3|pages=362\u2013371|via=|doi=10.1145/566654.566590}}</ref>\n\n<math>\\underset{u,v}{\\text{min}} \\int_S \\frac{1}{2} ||\\nabla u||^2 + \\frac{1}{2} ||\\nabla v||^2 - \\nabla u \\cdot \\nabla v^{\\perp} </math>\n\nTo avoid the problem of having all the vertices mapped to a single point, we also require that the solution to the optimization problem must have a non-zero norm and that it is orthogonal to the trivial solution.\n\n== Deformation ==\n[[File:Asrigidaspossible-man.gif|thumb|394x394px|An example of as-rigid-as-possible deformation.]]\nDeformation is concerned with transforming some rest shape to a new shape. Typically, these transformations are continuous and do not alter the topology of the shape. Modern mesh-based shape deformation methods satisfy user deformation constraints at handles (selected vertices or regions on the mesh) and propagate these handle deformations to the rest of shape smoothly and without removing or distorting details. Some common forms of interactive deformations are point-based, skeleton-based, and cage-based.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Jacobson|first1=Alec|last2=Baran|first2=Ilya|last3=Popovi\u0107|first3=Jovan|last4=[[Olga_Sorkine-Hornung|Sorkine]]|first4=Olga|year=2011|title=Bounded Biharmonic Weights for Real-Time Deformation|url=https://igl.ethz.ch/projects/bbw/bounded-biharmonic-weights-siggraph-2011-jacobson-et-al.pdf|journal=ACM Transactions on Graphics|volume=30|issue=4|pages=1|doi=10.1145/2010324.1964973}}</ref> In point-based deformation, a user can apply transformations to small set of points, called handles, on the shape. Skeleton-based deformation defines a [[skeleton]] for the shape, which allows a user to move the bones and rotate the joints. Cage-based deformation requires a cage to be drawn around all or part of a shape so that, when the user manipulates points on the cage, the volume it encloses changes accordingly.\n\n=== Point-based deformation ===\nHandles provide a sparse set of constraints for the deformation: as the user moves one point, the others must stay in place.\n\nA rest surface <math>\\hat{S}</math> [[Immersion (mathematics)|immersed]] in <math>\\R^3</math> can be described with a mapping <math>\\hat{x} : \\Omega \\rightarrow \\R^3</math>, where <math>\\Omega</math> is a 2D parametric domain. The same can be done with another mapping <math>x</math> for the transformed surface <math>S</math>. Ideally, the transformed shape adds as little distortion as possible to the original. One way to model this distortion is in terms of displacements <math>d = x - \\hat{x}</math> with a Laplacian-based energy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Marc|first=Alexa|year=2003|title=Differential coordinates for local mesh morphing and deformation|journal=The Visual Computer|volume=19|pages=105\u2013114}}</ref> Applying the Laplace operator to these mappings allows us to measure how the position of a point changes relative to its neighborhood, which keeps the handles smooth. Thus, the energy we would like to minimize can be written as:\n\n<math>\\min_{\\textbf{d}} \\int_{\\Omega} || \\Delta \\textbf{d} ||^2 dA</math>.\n\nWhile this method is translation invariant, it is unable to account for rotations. The As-Rigid-As-Possible deformation scheme<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=[[Olga_Sorkine-Hornung|Sorkine]]|first1=Olga|last2=Alexa|first2=Marc|year=2007|title=As-Rigid-As-Possible Surface Modeling|url=https://www.igl.ethz.ch/projects/ARAP/arap_web.pdf|journal=Proceedings of EUROGRAPHICS/ACM SIGGRAPH Symposium on Geometry Processing|pages=109\u2013116}}</ref> applies a rigid transformation <math>x_i = R\\hat{x_i} + t</math> to each handle i, where <math>R \\in SO(3) \\subset \\R^3</math> is a rotation matrix and <math>t \\in \\R^3</math> is a translation vector. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no way to know the rotations in advance, so instead we pick a \u201cbest\u201d rotation that minimizes displacements. To achieve local rotation invariance, however, requires a function <math>\\textbf{R} : \\Omega \\rightarrow SO(3)</math> which outputs the best rotation for every point on the surface. The resulting energy, then, must optimize over both <math>\\textbf{x}</math> and <math>\\textbf{R}</math>:\n\n<math>\\min_{\\textbf{x,R} \\in SO(3)} \\int_{\\Omega} || \\nabla \\textbf{x} - \\textbf{R} \\nabla \\hat{\\textbf{x}} ||^2 dA</math>\n\nNote that the translation vector is not present in the final objective function because translations have constant gradient.\n\n== Inside-Outside Segmentation ==\nWhile seemingly trivial, in many cases, determining the inside from the outside of a triangle mesh is not an easy problem. In general, given a surface <math>S</math> we pose this problem as determining a function <math>isInside(q)</math> which will return <math>1</math> if the point <math>q</math> is inside <math>S</math>, and <math>0</math> otherwise.\n\nIn the simplest case, the shape is closed. In this case, to determine if a point <math>q</math> is inside or outside the surface, we can cast a ray <math>r</math> in any direction from a query point, and count the number of times <math>count_r</math> it passes through the surface. If <math>q</math> was outside <math>S</math> then the ray must either not pass through <math>S</math> (in which case <math>count_r = 0</math>) or, each time it enters <math>S</math> it must pass through twice, because S is bounded, so any ray entering it must exit. So if <math>q</math> is outside, <math>count_r</math> is even. Likewise if <math>q</math> is inside, the same logic applies to the previous case, but the ray must intersect <math>S</math> one extra time for the first time it leaves <math>S</math>. So:\n\n<math>\nisInside_r(q) = \\left\\{\n        \\begin{array}{ll}\n            1 & count_r \\ is \\ odd \\\\\n            0 & count_r \\ is \\ even\\\\\n        \\end{array}\n    \\right.\n</math>\n\nNow, often times we cannot guarantee that the <math>S</math> is closed. Take the pair of pants example from the top of this article. This mesh clearly has a semantic inside-and-outside, despite there being holes at the waist and the legs.\n\n[[File:Point shooting.gif|thumb|Approximating inside-outside segmentation by shooting rays from a query point for varying number of rays.]]\n\nThe naive attempt to solve this problem is to shoot many rays in random directions, and classify <math>q</math> as being inside if and only if most of the rays intersected <math>S</math> an odd number of times. To quantify this, let us say we cast <math>k</math> rays, <math>r_1,r_2,\\dots,r_k</math>. We associate a number <math>rayTest(q) = \\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{i=1}^{k} isInside_{r_i}(q)</math> which is the average value of <math>isInside_r</math> from each ray. Therefore:\n\n<math>\nisInside(q) = \\left\\{\n        \\begin{array}{ll}\n            1 & rayTest(q) \\geq 0.5 \\\\\n            0 & rayTest(q) < 0.5\\\\\n        \\end{array}\n    \\right.\n</math>\n\nIn the limit of shooting many, many rays, this method handles open meshes, however it in order to become accurate, far too many rays are required for this method to be computationally ideal. Instead, a more robust approach is the Generalized Winding Number.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Jacobson|first1=Alec|last2=Ladislav|first2=Kavan|last3=[[Olga_Sorkine-Hornung|Sorkine-Hornung]]|first3=Olga|year=2013|title=Robust Inside-Outside Segmentation using Generalized Winding Numbers|url=http://igl.ethz.ch/projects/winding-number/robust-inside-outside-segmentation-using-generalized-winding-numbers-siggraph-2013-jacobson-et-al.pdf|journal=ACM Transactions on Graphics |volume=32|issue=4|pages=1|via=|doi=10.1145/2461912.2461916}}</ref> Inspired by the 2D [[winding number]], this approach uses the [[solid angle]] at <math>q</math> of each triangle in the mesh to determine if <math>q</math> is inside or outside. The value of the Generalized Winding Number at <math>q</math>, <math>wn(q)</math> is proportional to the sum of the solid angle contribution from each triangle in the mesh:\n\n<math>wn(q) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\sum_{t \\in F} solidAngle(t)</math>\n\nFor a closed mesh, <math>wn(q)</math> is equivalent to the characteristic function for the volume represented by <math>S</math>. Therefore, we say:\n\n<math>\nisInside(q) = \\left\\{\n        \\begin{array}{ll}\n            1 & wn(q) \\geq 0.5 \\\\\n            0 & wn(q) < 0.5 \\\\\n        \\end{array}\n    \\right.\n</math>\n\nBecause <math>wn(q)</math> is a [[harmonic function]], it degrades gracefully, meaning the inside-outside segmentation would not change much if we poked holes in a closed mesh. For this reason, the Generalized Winding Number handles open meshes robustly. The boundary between inside and outside smoothly passes over holes in the mesh. In fact, in the limit, the Generalized Winding Number is equivalent to the ray-casting method as the number of rays goes to infinity.\n\n== Applications ==\n* [[Computer-aided design]] (CAD)\n* 3D [[#Surface reconstruction|Surface Reconstruction]], ''e.g.'' range scanners in airport security, autonomous vehicles, medical scanner data reconstruction\n* Image-to-world Registration, ''e.g.'' [[Image-guided surgery]]\n* [[Architecture]], ''e.g.'' creating, [[reverse engineering]]\n* Physics simulations\n* Computer games ''e.g.'' [[collision detection]]\n* [[Geologic modelling]]\n* [[Visualization (graphics)]] ''e.g.'' [[Information visualization]]s, [[mathematical visualization]]s\n* [[Texture mapping]]\n* [[Modelling biological systems]] ''e.g.'' muscle and bone modelling, real-time hand tracking\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Computer graphics]]\n* [[Computer-aided design]] (CAD)\n* [[Industrial CT scanning]]\n* [[List of interactive geometry software]]\n* [[Digital image processing]]\n* [[Signal processing]]\n* [[Discrete differential geometry]]\n* [[Glossary of differential geometry and topology]]\n* [[Topology]]\n* [[Calculus of variations]]\n* [[MeshLab]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.geometryprocessing.org/ Symposium on Geometry Processing]\n* [http://www.multires.caltech.edu/ Multi-Res Modeling Group], [[Caltech]] \n* [http://geom.mi.fu-berlin.de/index.html Mathematical Geometry Processing Group], [[Free University of Berlin]]\n* [http://www.graphics.rwth-aachen.de Computer Graphics Group], [[RWTH Aachen University]]\n* [http://www.pmp-book.org/ Polygon Mesh Processing Book]\n* [https://www.pmp-library.org/ Polygon Mesh Processing Library]\n* [https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/DGPDEC/ Discrete Differential Geometry: An Applied Introduction], course notes by Keenan Crane et al.\n* [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOp-ngXvomHArqntgLVNzuJNdzNx3rDjZ Video tutorials] from [[Symposium on Geometry Processing|SGP 2017]] grad school\n* [https://libigl.github.io/ libigl] geometry processing library\n\n[[Category:Geometry processing]]\n[[Category:3D imaging]]\n[[Category:3D computer graphics]]\n[[Category:Geometry]]\n[[Category:Computational geometry]]\n[[Category:Differential geometry]]\n", "name_user": "WereSpielChequers", "label": "safe", "comment": "Typo fixing, replaced: be can  \u2192  can be,typo(s) fixed: there\u2019s \u2192 there's, often times \u2192 oftentimes", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry_processing"}

Chellappa is a smart college student from a poor family, he lives with his widow mother Thangamma (Vaani). Saroja is the daughter of the village chief ([[S. S. Chandran]]) and arrogant Rasathi ([[Srividya]]). Sudalamani is Saroja's relative and a womanizer who teases the village girls. He wants to marry Saroja to gain her property. One day, Chellappa beats up Sudalamani and they land at Saroja's house. At the village court, Chellappa remains silent. Irritated by his reaction, she gets him suspended from the college. She later comes to know that Chellappa saved a blind girl from the pervert Sudalamani, but Chellappa remains silent at the village court to protect the blind girl's privacy.\n\nSaroja wrongly accuses Chellappa of kidnapping her and holding her for a day. Chellappa accepts the blame and he says he did much worse. The villagers advise her to marry Chellappa. The shrewish Rasathi refuses and tries to find a bribe for her daughter, but nobody wanted to marry an unchaste woman. Only Sudalamani accepts for marriage and they arrange their wedding. The day before their wedding, the villagers force Chellappa to marry Saroja. What transpires next forms the rest of the story.\n\n==Cast==\n\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Saravanan (actor)|Saravanan]] as Chellappa\n*[[Ahana (actress)|Ahana]] as Saroja\n*[[S. S.

Chellappa is a smart college student from a poor family, he lives with his widow mother Thangamma (Vaani). Saroja is the daughter of the village chief ([[S. S. Chandran]]) and arrogant Rasathi ([[Srividya]]). Sudalamani is Saroja's relative and a womanizer who teases the village girls. He wants to get married to Saroja to gain her property. One day, Chellappa beats up Sudalamani and they land at Saroja's house. At the village court, Chellappa remains silent. Irritated by his reaction, she gets him suspended from the college. She later comes to know that Chellappa saved a blind girl from the pervert Sudalamani, but Chellappa remains silent at the village court to protect the blind girl's privacy.\n\nSaroja wrongly accuses Chellappa of kidnapping her and holding her for a day. Chellappa accepts the blame and he says he did much worse. The villagers advise her to get married to Chellappa. The shrewish Rasathi refuses and tries to find a bribe for her daughter, but nobody was ready to get married to an unchaste woman. Only Sudalamani accepts for marriage and they arrange their wedding. The day before their wedding, the villagers force Chellappa to get married to Saroja. What transpires next forms the rest of the story.\n\n==Cast==\n\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Saravanan (actor)|Saravanan]] as Chellappa\n*[[Ahana (actress)|Ahana]] as Saroja\n*[[S. S.

He was schooled initially at the small border village of [[More, Shropshire]] by a Mr Perkin, a close relative of his mother. [[Samuel Clarke (minister)|Samuel Clarke]], whose 1651 account is the basis for all later biographers, thought that it was from Perkin at More that Herring \"learned the Principles of Religion.\"<ref name=clarke462/> Clarke describes Perkin as a minister at ''More-chappel'' and these details have generally been accepted at face value.<ref name=odnb/> However, the [[Clergy of the Church of England database]] lists More as a [[parish church]] within the [[Diocese of Hereford]], not as a chapelry.<ref>[http://db.theclergydatabase.org.uk/jsp/locations/index.jsp?locKey=3295 CCEd Location ID: 3295.]</ref> [[Robert William Eyton|Eyton]], the pioneering historian of Shropshire, considered that More probably began as a chapelry of [[Lydbury North]] but \"became independent, at a period which the earliest Records fail to reach.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/antiquitiesshro11eytogoog#page/n320/mode/2up Eyton, p. 290.]</ref> CCEd does list some clergy at More in the 1580s and Perkin is not among them, although the database cannot be exhaustive. It does not note any parish school at More but there was one at nearby Lydbury, although records of staff seem to start only with the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]].<ref>[http://db.theclergydatabase.org.uk/jsp/locations/index.jsp?locKey=239242 CCEd Location ID: 239242.]</ref> The older [[Dictionary of National Biography]] avers that Perkin was a minister at ''Morechurch'':<ref name=dnb/> there is a Churchmoor, further east, in Lydbury North parish, but it is a hamlet with no chapel.\n\nHerring then moved to the family home at Coventry, where he attended the [[King Henry VIII School, Coventry|Free Grammar School]]. Clarke credits his academic progress there to the then headmaster, whom he names as Reverend Master Tovey.<ref name=clarke462/> Even as a schoolboy he was noted for his piety. Clarke credits him with an early interest and delight in the [[Bible]] passages that deal with faith and repentance \u2013 themes typically of great concern to [[Protestant]]s. On play days, he and a few friends engaged in prayer and religious exercises before going out.\n\nIn May 1600 Herring was admitted as a scholar to [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge]],<ref name=venn/> then a new, specifically Protestant institution. University records show he graduated [[Bachelor of Arts#United Kingdom and Ireland|BA]] in the academic year 1603-4: Clarke thought Herring returned to Coventry as a [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]].<ref name=clarke462/> There he studied [[Divinity (academic discipline)|Divinity]] with the encouragement of [[Humphrey Fenn]], a noted advocate of Presbyterianism and formerly a client of [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester]].<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=9280|title=Fenn, Humphrey|first=Jan|last=Broadway}}</ref> Fenn had been suspended from his ministry since 1590 for his activities within a Warwickshire [[classis (ecclesiastical)|classis]] within the Church of England and had not regained his vicarage of [[Holy Trinity Church, Coventry]]. Herring, however, seems to have found opportunities to preach, winning considerable approval.<ref name=brook489/><ref name=clarke462/>\n\n==Calke==\n\nHerring was approaching the age to take up a parish ministry of his own, but this required [[Holy orders#Anglicanism|ordination]]. Number 36 of the [[Canon law (Church of England)|Book of Canons]], confirmed by the [[Convocations of Canterbury and York]] in 1604 and 1606 respectively, demanded that all candidates for ordination take a three-fold oath, accepting the royal supremacy, the [[Book of Common Prayer]] and the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anglican.net/doctrines/1604-canon-law/#p1-3 |title=Constitutions and Canons Ecclesiastical, p. 3. |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=1603|website=Anglican.net |access-date= 11 January 2016 |quote=}}</ref> The subscription book of the [[Diocese of Coventry and Lichfield]], which covered the area in Herring both lived and sought a living, summarised the oath as:\n\n<blockquote>The king is the only supreme governor under God of all things spiritual as well as temporal: the Book of Common Prayer, with the ordering of bishops priests and deacons, contains nothing contrary to the word of God: the Articles of Religion (1562) are agreeable to the word of God.<ref>Coulton, p. 74.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHerring circumvented the requirement by securing ordination from an Irish bishop then visiting London. He was accompanied in this by other young Puritan men, including [[John Ball (Puritan)|John Ball]], a friend who was tutor to the children of Catherine and [[Robert Cholmondeley, 1st Earl of Leinster|Robert Cholmondley]].<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n495/mode/2up Clarke, p.441-2.]</ref> Only after the ordination were the pair able to take up their first ecclesiastical appointments: Ball as curate of [[Whitmore, Staffordshire|Whitmore]] in [[Staffordshire]]; Herring as preacher at [[Calke]] in Derbyshire.\n\n[[File:Arthur Hildersham-Samuel Clarke.jpg|thumb|left|Arthur Hildersham, Puritan preacher, from Samuel Clarke's ''Generall Martyrologie'', 1651. Woodcut, artist unknown.]]\nHerring was recommended for the post at Calke by [[Arthur Hildersham]], the vicar of [[Ashby-de-la-Zouch]], which was close by, although in [[Leicestershire]].<ref name=clarke463>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n517/mode/2up Clarke, p. 463.]</ref> In his early years he was both friend and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Hildersham,<ref>[http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/2794/1/WRAP_THESIS_Rowe_2009.pdf#235 Rowe, p. 227.]</ref> part of a generation of younger disciples that included [[Simeon Ashe]] and Hildersham's own son, Samuel.<ref>[http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/2794/1/WRAP_THESIS_Rowe_2009.pdf#162 Rowe, p. 154.]</ref> Herring was not the first member of Hilderham's circle appointed to Calke: Robert Bainbridge, the patron, had earlier installed George More, a close associate of Hildersham and of [[John Darrell]]. During the 1590s More took part in the religious exercises of the Hildersham circle, which included fasting, prayer, lectures and fellowship,<ref>[http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/2794/1/WRAP_THESIS_Rowe_2009.pdf#169 Rowe, p. 161.]</ref> and supported Darrell in the highly controversial work of [[Exorcism in Christianity|exorcism]].<ref>[http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/2794/1/WRAP_THESIS_Rowe_2009.pdf#282 Rowe, p. 274.]</ref>\n{{Wiktionary pipe|donative#English|donative}}\n\nClarke considered Calke a relatively secure base for Herring because it was a [[Royal peculiar|peculiar jurisdiction]] exempt from episcopal authority, as well as bringing the support of a sympathetic patron. CCEd, citing a 1772 reference, makes clear that Calke was a donative, rather than a peculiar.<ref>[http://db.theclergydatabase.org.uk/jsp/locations/index.jsp?locKey=233327 CCEd Location ID: 233327.]</ref> ''[[Magna Britannia]]'', published in 1817, numbered Calke among nine Derbyshire parishes that were donatives<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/magna-britannia/vol5/xi-xvii Lysons and Lysons, p. xi-xvii.]</ref> before the Victorian abolition of these institutions. In a donative the [[advowson|patron]] had the right to make an appointment to the [[benefice#Church of England|benefice]] without reference to the [[Ordinary (officer)|ordinary]]<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/ecclesiasticalla01phil#page/252/mode/2up Phillimore, p. 252-3.]</ref> \u2013 in this case the local [[diocesan bishop]]. The church and the incumbent were exempt from ordinary jurisdiction:<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/ecclesiasticalla01phil#page/254/mode/2up Phillimore, p. 254.]</ref> in a peculiar there is an ordinary jurisdiction but it does not belong to the local bishop. Calke church was part of Calke [[manorial system|manor]] \u2013 a former monastic estate that passed into lay hands through the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]]. Although later named [[Calke Abbey]], it had actually been a very small [[Augustinian]] priory, which was absorbed as a mere cell into its own daughter house, [[Repton Priory]]: under the founder's terms, the church had been given to the canons on condition they supply it with a priest.<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/derbs/vol2/pp58-63 Page, pp. 58-63.]</ref> Robert Bainbridge bought the Calke estate in 1582<ref name=bainbridge>M.

He was a militant Protestant, three times MP for [[Derby (UK Parliament constituency)|Derby]], who was imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]] during March 1587 after he had demanded the execution of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] and supported [[Sir Anthony Cope, 1st Baronet|Anthony Cope's]] proposal for a radical reform of Church government: he and his friends made the mistake of continuing to argue outside the chamber of the House of Commons, where they were not protected by [[Parliamentary privilege in the United Kingdom|parliamentary privilege]].<ref name=bainbridge/>\n[[File:Simeon Ashe.jpg|thumb|Simeon Ashe]]\nAlthough Calke was a very small settlement, then as now, it seems to have formed an ideal base for Herring's ministry, which was primarily one of [[preaching]]. Clarke remarks that \"God was pleased to set a broad scale to his Ministry.\"<ref name=clarke463/> A clear and powerful preacher, he drew an audience from up to twenty towns and villages, with Sunday congregations in good weather so large that many were forced to cluster around the windows to hear him. Some brought picnics and made a day of it, while others bought refreshments from the \"threepenny ordinary\" provided for strangers. The impact of his preaching on the region was increased by the practice of returning home in groups, singing [[psalm]]s and discussing the [[sermon]]. Clarke thought that the effectiveness of Herring's preaching as part of the Hildersham circle was proved by the very high retention of Puritan converts in the region, who remained with the cause through the \"broken dividing times\" that followed: presumably meaning the period of [[Thorough]] or [[absolute monarchy]], the [[English Civil War]] and the [[Regicide#The regicide of Charles I of England|Regicide]]. Herring seems to have had a profound influence over Simeon Ashe, later a moderate Presbyterian preacher and an intimate of important parliamentarian leaders, including [[Robert Greville, 2nd Baron Brooke]] and [[Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester]]. Herring took the opportunity of a relatively stable period in his life to marry and start a family. His wife was Christian<ref name=odnb/> Gellibrand. The match was remembered in Puritan hagiography as a particularly happy and mutually-supportive.<ref name=clarke463/><ref>[https://archive.org/stream/livespuritansco01broogoog#page/n500/mode/2up Brook, p. 490.]</ref>\n\nHerring's ministry at Calke seems to have lasted until 1618. Clarke thought he was \"forced from thence for Nonconformity by the Prelatical power, being informed against by ill-affected men.\"<ref name=clarke463/> He gives no details of how Herring could be removed from a donative. Barbara Coulton, a recent historian of Shrewsbury during this the period, gives 1617 as the year Herring was recruited by William Rowley of Shrewsbury,<ref name=coulton75>Coulton, p. 75.</ref> suggesting that he was attracted by a more influential post rather than driven out of Calke. This is supported by the baptism of Christian, a daughter of Herring, at [[St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury]] as early as 1 February 1618.<ref>Coulton, p. 76.</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/stream/shropshireparish15lichshro#page/4/mode/2up ''St Chad's parish register'', Volume 1, p. 4.]</ref> Herring's patron Bainbridge must by this time have been elderly, as he first sat in the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] in 1571.<ref name=bainbridge/> He may have been in financial difficulties: although he had a vault prepared for his burial at Calke, he sold the estate only three years after Herring's departure and died before July 1623.\n\n==Shrewsbury==\n\nIn 1618 Herring took up residence in Shrewsbury, at the invitation of the corporation, as lecturer at St Alkmund's Church. This was not an incumbency: the vicar of St Alkmund's throughout Herring's time in Shrewsbury was Thomas Lloyd, who had been appointed in 1607.<ref name=ob279>[https://archive.org/stream/historyofshrewsb02owen#page/278/mode/2up Owen and Blakeway, p. 279.]</ref> Lloyd was held in no great regard as a preacher and was paid \u00a35 to read [[Morning Prayer (Anglican)|Morning Prayer]].<ref name=coulton78>Coulton, p. 78.</ref> Herring's lectureship did not require an oath before the bishop, as it was privately funded by a \u00a320 annuity. This was provided by [[Rowland Heylyn]], a merchant of Welsh ancestry, educated at [[Shrewsbury School]] and a former parishioner of St Alkmund's, who had become immensely wealthy and powerful in the [[Worshipful Company of Ironmongers]] in London.<ref name=coulton75/> Heylyn had two sisters living in Shrewsbury, Ann and Eleanor, who were married respectively to John Nicholls and Richard Hunt, powerful local politicians who were associates of William Rowley, described by Clarke as \"a wise religious man.\"<ref name=clarke464>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n519/mode/2up Clarke, p. 464.]</ref> It was Rowley who made the initial approach to Herring and acted throughout as his \"faithful friend.\" It seems that he initially accommodated the Herring family in his own mansion.<ref name=coulton78/> Rowley was a member of Shrewsbury's powerful [[Shrewsbury Drapers Company|Drapers' Company]] and Hunt was its warden.<ref name=coulton79>Coulton, p. 79.</ref> The company's hall was vacant and it was probably they who prevailed on the members to lease it to Herring for \u00a34 annually, the company reserving the right to use it for meetings but agreeing to pay for repairs.<ref name=ob279n4>[https://archive.org/stream/historyofshrewsb02owen#page/278/mode/2up Owen and Blakeway, p. 279-80, note 4.]</ref>\n\nHerring was obliged to preach twice weekly: on Tuesday morning and at 1 pm on Sunday. This was to avoid offending the other clergy in the town by poaching their congregations.<ref name=clarke464/> In addition, he repeated the Sunday sermon that evening, alternating between the houses of three powerful Puritan merchants: Edward Jones, George Wright and Rowley. A specimen of his preaching, showing his [[hermeneutic]] method at the service of his Puritan audience, runs:\n:{{Bibleverse|1 Corinthians|3:22b|KJV}}: ''All are yours.''\n\n<blockquote>Yours! Whose meaneth the apostle by ''yours''? The Christian Corinths, to whome this epistle was directed, and those words. And what meaneth hee by the word ''all''. The verse itself shewes you. \"Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, \u2013 or life, or death, or things present, or things to come, ''All are yours.''\" And the expression is of a further latitude, v. 21. for all ''things'' are yours. All things therefore are the true Christian's. This is the truth that I am to teach you. Therefore, without any further coherence of these words with the former, or resolving the text into parts, (which is the ordinarie course of ministers,)  I must fall upon this; \u2013 all things are the true Christian's.<ref name=ob279n4/></blockquote>\n\n[[File:ThomasMorton.jpg|thumb|Thomas Morton]]\n\nHerring was subject to attack and controversy on both sides, conservative and radical, during his preaching ministry at Shrewsbury. As early as 1620, just after [[Thomas Morton (bishop)|Thomas Morton]] became Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, Herring was reported to the authorities for failure to use the prayer book and to receive or administer the sacraments.<ref name=odnb/> Morton had clashed with Puritan clergy in his former [[Diocese of Chester]] over ceremonial practices and the [[Declaration of Sports]]. His response had been [[eirenic]] in spirit,<ref name=coulton79/> if sometimes exacting and abrasive in person: he had, for example, given [[Thomas Paget (Puritan minister)|Thomas Paget]], a leading Lancashire Puritan minister, 10 shillings towards his legal expenses after compelling him to appear with a list of written arguments against signing with the cross in [[Infant baptism|baptism]].<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/defenceofchurchg00page#page/n13/mode/2up Thomas Paget, ''An Humble Advertisment (sic) to the high Court of Parliament'' p. 8. in John Paget: ''A Defence Of Church-Government, Exercised in Presbyteriall, Classicall, & Synodall Assemblies''.]</ref> Morton referred Herring to two neighbouring ministers for satisfaction and he made a written statement of his reservations. The two ministers supported Herring with a certificate to the bishop and he pronounced himself satisfied with Herring's integrity. However, the incident opened up a series of suspensions and reinstatements.<ref name=clarke465>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n519/mode/2up Clarke p. 465.]</ref> It seems that he continued to conduct private fasts and Bible expositions even during periods when his public ministry was made impossible. These would have been held in Draper's Hall, which was his own home.<ref name=coulton82>Coulton, p. 82.</ref>\n\nOpposition to Herring coalesced around Peter Studley, who was incumbent or [[curate]] of St Chad's from 1622<ref>Coulton, p. 80.</ref> and also took responsibility for St Julian's, which was very close.<ref name=coulton82/> His appointment seems to reflect the emergence on the corporation of a conservative opposition, which was able to appoint a second lecturer to St Alkmund's: Samuel Greaves, the [[rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] of [[Berrington, Shropshire|Berrington]], who preached on Wednesday mornings for \u00a310 a year.<ref name=coulton83>Coulton, p. 83.</ref> An [[canonical visitation|episcopal visitation]] of 1626, possibly attended by Morton himself, found Studley at loggerheads with the town's Puritans and many of the complaints and counter-claims were directly related to Herring's preaching ministry. The congregation of St Julian's were up in arms because, they alleged, Studley deliberately timed services to prevent them attending preaching elsewhere, but refrained from preaching himself. Studley reported Rowley and Wright for holding preaching and prayer meetings in their homes on Sunday evenings, suggesting that the episcopal court should judge whether or not these constituted [[conventicle]]s.<ref name=coulton82/> However, Studley was also meeting fierce opposition from a more radical group of poorer parishioners, of whom the most prominent were [[Katherine Chidley]] and her family.<ref name=coulton83/> Chidley had led a group of women in refusing to take part in the [[churching of women]], which some Puritans found offensive and for which Studley demanded a fee. She arrived through her experiences at separatist conclusions and was later to write in justification of [[Independent (religion)|Independent]] or [[Congregationalist polity|Congregationalist]] tendency within Puritanism. Herring was opposed to this group, and Clarke reports his frequent observation:\n\n<blockquote>It is a sin of an high nature to unchurch a Nation at once, and that this would become the spring of many other fearful errours, for separation will eat like a Gangrene into the heart of Godlinesse. And he did pray, that they who would un-church others, might not be un-christianed themselves.<ref name=clarke465/></blockquote>\n\nHerring's opposition to separatism was also made manifest by his attendance at his local parish church, even though he had an appointment in a neighbouring parish. He attended the [[Eucharist|Lord's Supper]] at [[St Mary's Church, Shrewsbury|St Mary's]], a royal peculiar<ref name=coulton82/> that was effectively controlled by the corporation. The vicar on Herring's arrival was William Bright, a nominee of the Puritan divine [[Laurence Chaderton]],<ref>Coulton, p. 77.</ref> and congenial to Herring. However, Bright died in October 1618 and was buried on the 29th of that month.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/shropshireparish12lichshro#page/56/mode/2up St Mary's parish register, p. 56.]</ref> He was replaced, on Chaderton's recommendation,<ref name=coulton79/> with [[Samuel Browne (divine)|Samuel Browne]], a more moderate figure who nevertheless stoutly defended his church against episcopal interference.<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=3696|title=Browne, Samuel|first=Elizabeth|last=Allen}}</ref> On 19 January 1620, the St Mary's parish register records the burial of \"A sonn, being not baptized, of Mr. Hearing, a Mynester of God's word.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/shropshireparish12lichshro#page/58/mode/2up St Mary's parish register, p. 58.]</ref>  Later in the same year, on 17 December, the register records a baptism: \"Samuell, s. of Mr. Hearing, preacher of the Word.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/shropshireparish12lichshro#page/58/mode/2up St Mary's parish register, p. 59.]</ref> These descriptions suggest concord between Browne and Herring.<ref name=coulton79/> Moreover, for the baptism of Dorcas on 30 January 1623 Herring is again described as a preacher of the Word,<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/shropshireparish12lichshro#page/62/mode/2up St Mary's parish register, p. 63.]</ref> and for Mary's on 6 February 1625 as \"Mynester,\" while Browne himself is described in the entry for his own daughter's baptism as \"publique preacher.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/shropshireparish12lichshro#page/66/mode/2up St Mary's parish register, p. 67.]</ref> This suggests a looseness of terminology and a sense of equality and respect between the two clerics. The baptisms of two more children chart Herring's residence in the parish: for Joanna's on 19 August 1627 he is simply \"Mr. Jolynus Hearing.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/shropshireparish12lichshro#page/72/mode/2up St Mary's parish register, p. 72.]</ref> However, after Browne's death in 1632 and the appointment of the Puritan James Betton to St Mary's,<ref name=coulton86/> the entry for Herring's son Theophilus on 5 September 1633 again uses the title \"Minister\".<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/shropshireparish12lichshro#page/82/mode/2up St Mary's parish register, p. 82.]</ref> As he continued a valued parishioner of St Mary's, Herring's position at St Alkmund's also became more secure. Heylyn operated through a group of Puritan ministers and businessmen who had established a body known as the [[Feoffees for Impropriations]]s, sometimes known as the Collectors of [[St Antholin, Budge Row|St Antholin]],<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/historyofshrewsb02owen#page/270/mode/2up Owen and Blakeway, p. 271-2.]</ref> to channel funds into Puritan preaching. Heylyn became a feoffee in 1626 and two years later oversaw the acquisition of the [[advowson]] of St Alkmund's and a lease on the tithes of St Mary's.<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=13172|title=Heylyn, Rowland|first=Marc L.|last=Schwarz}}</ref> His distance from any radicalism strengthened his position, so that it was admitted even by his enemies:\n\n<blockquote>Though he be scrupulous in matter of ceremony, yet he is a loyal subject unto the King, and a true friend unto the state.<ref name=clarke464/></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Worfield - Margaret Bromley 01.JPG|thumb|Effigy of Lady Margaret Bromley, [[Worfield]].]]\n\nHerring continued to make and maintain links with moderate Presbyterian preachers in the region and beyond, gaining recognition for Shrewsbury as the centre of a Puritan network.<ref name=odnb/> He brought his brother-in-law, Robert Nicolls of [[Wrenbury]], and Thomas Pierson of [[Brampton Bryan]] to preach in the town.<ref name=clarke464/> It is possible that Samuel Clarke, Herring's biographer, also visited Shrewsbury.<ref>Coulton p. 84.</ref> Along with John Ball, Pierson, Nicolls and Herring were part of a group who met for religious exercises in [[Sheriffhales]] at the home of Lady [[Margaret Bromley]],<ref name=clarke469>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n523/mode/2up Clarke, p. 469.]</ref> widow from 1626 of the noted judge [[Edward Bromley|Sir Edward Bromley]].<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/TheVisitationOfShropshireV.28/VisitationshrophshiretAken1623_treswellVol28P1#page/n131/mode/2up ''Visitation of Shropshire'', p. 78.]</ref>\n[[File:William Laud.jpg|thumb|left|William Laud]]\nDuring the 1630s the bitterness of religious conflict at Shrewsbury intensified to a pitch that brought national attention and made Herring's position precarious. [[Robert Wright (bishop)|Bishop Wright's]] visitation of the town provided Studley with an opportunity for a triumphal reading  of ordinances on the decoration of churches, but also for a denunciation of his opponents that revealed the depth of opposition. Herring's supporters, Rowley and Wright, were now joined by [[Humphrey Mackworth (Parliamentarian)|Humphrey Mackworth]] as leaders of a group that refused to bow at the Name of Jesus and to kneel for communion, and so were counted as refusers of the Eucharist.<ref>Coulton, p. 85.</ref> Studley went on to write a savage denunciation of Puritanism, ''The Looking-Glass of Schisme'', claiming that religious nonconformity had influenced the commission of sensational murders at Clun.<ref name=coulton86>Coulton, p. 86.</ref> The furore in Shrewsbury attracted the attention of [[William Laud]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] himself. Laud Proposed to use negotiations over the renewal of the town's charter to prize the town's main churches free of the corporation's control.<ref>Coulton, p. 87.</ref> He acknowledged Herring's role in the town's opposition with the comment: \"I will pickle up that Herring of Shrewsbury.\" Herring's response is reported as:\n\n<blockquote>If he will abuse his power, let it teach Christians the more to use their prayers. And be then prayed that the Non-conformists enemies might by observation that they have a good God to trust unto, when trampled upon by ill-despised men.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n521/mode/2up Clarke, p. 466.]</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nLaud instituted a visitation of the entire [[Province of Canterbury]] in 1635, with [[Nathaniel Brent]] conducting enquiries in the Lichfield diocese. Brent suspended Puritans at [[St Peter's Collegiate Church]] in Wolverhampton, before moving on to Shrewsbury, where he also came into conflict with local clergy.<ref name=coulton88>Coulton, p. 88.</ref> At some point in the early part of 1635 Herring and his family left Shrewsbury.\n\n==Wrenbury==\n[[File:St Margarets Wrenbury.jpg|thumb|St Margaret's Church Wrenbury, where Nicolls and Peartree were incumbents.]]\nHerring sought a home first in [[Wrenbury]], [[Cheshire]], where his wife's sister lived: Robert Nicolls, her husband and Herring's friend, had died at Sheriffhales in 1630.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/livespuritansco01broogoog#page/n386/mode/2up Brook, p. 375.]</ref> Wrenbury had originally been part of the parish of [[St Mary's Church, Acton]], and its church was still in the gift of the vicar of Acton.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/historicalsketch00urwi#page/138/mode/2up Urwick, p. 138.]</ref> The incumbent was William Peartree of [[Bury St Edmunds]], who had been suspended by Brent.<ref name=coulton88/> Herring had no formal appointment but lived privately as a parishioner, offering pastoral support by \"comforting afflicted consciences.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n521/mode/2up Clarke, p. 467.]</ref> Clarke claimed that Herring only moved to Wrenbury after despairing of his future in Shrewsbury, but it seems that he had not taken steps formally to terminate his lectureship or even his tenancy. On 14 April 1635 the Drapers' Company resolved to write to Herring about rent arrears of \u00a34 and to enquire whether he proposed to take up residence and preach before [[Midsummer]], after which time they would let his house to \"some brother of the company.\" It was duly leased on 17 September to John Betton, a draper.<ref name=ob279n4/>\n\n==Amsterdam==\n[[File:Tekening van kerk en begijnhof - Amsterdam - 20407839 - RCE.jpg|thumb|17th century print of the exterior of the English Reformed Church, from ''Beschrijvinge van Amsterdam'' by Tobias van Domselaer (1611-85).]]\nThis was a time of indecision for Herring. He received invitations to leave for [[New England]] but felt it was not for him.<ref name=clarke468>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n523/mode/2up Clake, p. 468.]</ref> His reservations may have been connected with a letter Herring and thirteen other Puritan clerics sent in 1637 to ministers in New England, which raised the alarm about separatism among them.<ref name=odnb/> However, towards the end of 1636, some friends put forward his name to John Rulice or Rulitius, then a pastor<ref name=steven279>[https://archive.org/stream/historyscottish00stevgoog#page/n310/mode/2up Steven, p. 279.]</ref> of the [[English Reformed Church, Amsterdam]]. Rulice had been sent to London to find someone who might take over the responsibilities of [[John Paget (Puritan minister)|John Paget]],<ref name=clarke468/> the church's first pastor, now [[emeritus]]. The opportunity faced Herring with numerous issues and conflicts. Not only was he concerned to be leaving family and friends: he had a vast library of records, that might incriminate them, but were of great personal and religious value to himself and his cause. After much deliberation, he burnt most of this collection, fearing a search of his person ''en route'' or of his home after he had left. This he described as that \"Lesser martyrdom, wherein many of the best thoughts of his dearest friends were committed to flames.\" He was then forced to plan a secret journey, as Laud had forbidden clergy to travel abroad without a licence.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n523/mode/2up Clarke, pp. 469-70.]</ref> After arranging a passage from [[Great Yarmouth|Yarmouth]], he made a will on 24 August 1637, leaving bequests for his wife and eight children. He then visited his sisters and set off for the coast with a brother-in-law, Oliver Bowles of [[Sutton, Bedfordshire]]. He avoided interception, reaching [[Rotterdam]] on 20 September and taking a wagon to Amsterdam the following day.<ref name=clarke470>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n525/mode/2up Clarke, p. 470.]</ref> He moved in with a friend, Whittaker, pending the arrival of his family and his remaining property.\n\nHerring delivered his first sermon on {{Bibleverse|Psalms|24:1|KJV}}: \"The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.\" This met with great approval, securing his acceptance by the congregation. This paved the way for ratification by the Consistory of [[Holland]] and the [[Classis (ecclesiastical)|Classis]] of Amsterdam. From the outset, he took a full part in the liturgy and culture of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], keeping the fast decreed by the [[States General of the Netherlands]] for the success of the army at the [[Siege of Breda (1637)|Siege of Breda]]. The arrival of his family the following day was a further relief, allowing him to commit himself to the post. He was joined after a couple of years by Thomas Paget, John's brother, who also took preaching and pastoral responsibilities at the English Reformed Church.\n\nAmsterdam, then central to the wealth and culture of the [[Dutch Golden Age]] and a Protestant stronghold forged and tested in the [[Dutch Revolt]] and [[Thirty Years' war]], gave Herring at last an unrivalled platform. He was now part of a functioning presbyterian system,<ref name=odnb/> complete with a collegial ministry, much as he and moderate Puritans, like himself and the Pagets, had demanded for England. He was able to pronounce more or less freely on the situation at home, where [[Charles I of Scotland|Charles I's]] absolute monarchy ran into the crisis of the [[Bishops' War]], a prelude to the civil war in England. He prayed and spoke out for the establishment of a Presbyterian polity in England. He made a sharp distinction between the persons of the bishops, to whom he had no enmity, and their \"Pride and Prelatical rule.\"<ref name=clarke471>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n525/mode/2up Clarke, p. 471.]</ref> He continued to stress a middle position, troubled by the many fissile Independent and [[Baptist]] sects among the English exile community<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/historyscottish00stevgoog#page/n300/mode/2up Steven, pp. 269-272.]</ref> in the Netherlands. When one of his sons returned to England, presumably around 1643, he warned him not to take part in any subversion of Presbyterian polity, saying \"I am sure it is the Government of Jesus Christ.\"<ref name=clarke471/>\n[[File:Passage of Newburn Ford.jpg|thumb|Victorian impression of the 1640 Scottish incursion into England.]]\nIn 1640 he welcomed the invasion of northern England by a Scottish [[Covenanter]] army expressing the hope that the Scots \"might be instruments of much good, but of no blood nor division between the two Nations.\" Clarke describes him as \"one of God's special Remembrancers, in behalf of England, begging fervently that the Lords and Commons in Parliament, might be preserved from the two destructive rocks of pride and self-interest.\" In May 1642, Lloyd died, leaving a vacancy at St Alkmund's. The Puritan party in Shrewsbury, headed by Rowley and Mackworth, invited Herring back to resume his ministry but he probably declined.<ref>Coulton, p. 90.</ref> In the event, the corporation proved supine at the commencement of hostilities and a [[Cavalier|royalist]] ''coup'' led by [[Francis Ottley]] allowed the king's field army to occupy Shrewsbury on 20 September.<ref>Coulton, p. 91-2.</ref> The next stage of campaigning led to the major but indecisive [[Battle of Edgehill]], which Herring greeted with the prayer:\n\n<blockquote>Oh Lord wilt thou write Englands Reformation in red letters of her own blood; yet preserve thine own People, and maintaine thine own cause for Iesus Christs sake.<ref name=clarke471/></blockquote>\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Samuel Clarke (minister).jpg|thumb|right|Samuel Clarke, biographer: a 1650 engraving attributed to [[Thomas Cross (engraver)|Thomas Cross]].]]\nHerring seems to have entered into a long illness and he was clearly troubled by periods of doubt as well as suffering, in the language of the time assaults by Satan.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n527/mode/2up Clarke, p. 472.]</ref> His last reported words, after such a period of uncertainty, were: \"He is overcome, overcome, through the strength of my Lord and only Saviour Iesus, unto whom I am now going to keep a Sabbath in glory.\" He died the following morning, given by Clarke as Sunday 28 March 1644. The date is widely<ref name=odnb/><ref name=dnb/><ref>[https://archive.org/stream/livespuritansco01broogoog#page/n502/mode/2up Brook, p. 492.]</ref> but not universally accepted. William Steven in 1833 calculated Herring's ministry as lasting eight years from 1637, which implies he died in 1645.<ref name=steven279/> Coulton in 2010 noted that the corporation of Shrewsbury wrote to Herring again asking him to return, apparently in 1645, some months after the town fell to [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] forces.<ref>Coulton, p. 105.</ref> The corporation's invitation seems inconsistent with a death in 1644. Coulton is noncommital about the actual date, but points out that the register of the English Reformed Church shows he was certainly dead by 18 May 1645. The parishioners of Chad's parish in Shrewsbury subsequently switched their attention to Thomas Paget, Herring's co-pastor at Amsterdam, and in 1646 elected him their minister.<ref>Coulton, p. 106.</ref> Herring's will was proved by Christian, his widow on 26 March 1646.<ref name=odnb/>\n\nSamuel Clarke's biography of Herring, part of a set of Puritan studies appended to his ''Generall Martyrologie'', appeared as early as 1651, under the [[Commonwealth of England]], and is informed by many who knew Herring.\n\n==Marriage and family==\n\nHerring married Christian Gellibrand during the time he was preaching at Calke.  She was the third daughter of an English preacher who had served at [[Vlissingen]], and a granddaughter of John Oxenbridge, a celebrated Warwickshire Puritan minister:<ref name=clarke463/> hence she was a cousin of the [[John Oxenbridge]] who was a notable minister at [[Boston]], Massachusetts.  Christian outlived her husband by some years and was still alive and evidently in good standing with the Reformed community in 1651, when Clarke published his biography. One of her sisters married Robert Nicolls, minister at Wrenbury, another married Oliver Bowles of Sutton, Bedfordshire, and a third married one Barry of [[Cottesmore, Rutland]]. These all formed part of the Puritan network which helped sustain Herring's ministry.\n\nJulines and Christian Herring had 13 children,<ref name=clarke464/> although some are known to have died and only eight are mentioned in Juline's will. A son, Jonathan, seems to have preceded the children born at Shrewsbury: it may have been he who reached the Netherlands with or earlier than his father, as Herring had a son with him before the rest of the family arrived.<ref name=clarke470/> Clarke considered it a mark of enlightened and loving upbringing that, before disciplining his children, Herring explained to them the nature of any wrong they had done.\n\n==Mapping Julines Herring's life==\n\n<div style=\"clear: both;

Ejected from his positions for nonconformity, he became a minister serving the English-speaking community in the Netherlands. He was a staunch proponent of [[Presbyterian polity|Presbyterianism]] and an opponent of separatism.\n\n==Origins==\n\nHerring was born at [[Llanbrynmair]],<ref name=odnb>{{cite ODNB|id=13097|title=Herring, Julines|first=Jacqueline|last=Eales}}</ref> then part of [[Montgomeryshire]] and now part of [[Powys]], often rendered in older sources in Anglicised forms, e.g. ''Flamber-Mayre'',<ref name=brook489>[https://archive.org/stream/livespuritansco01broogoog#page/n498/mode/2up Brook, p. 489.]</ref> or ''Flambere-Mayre''.<ref name=dnb>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Herring, Julines|title=|url=|last=Bickley|first=Augustus Charles|authorlink=|volume=26|pages=|quote=|accessdate=6 January 2016|vb=|supplement=|no-icon=}}</ref> He was a son of Richard Herring,<ref name=venn>{{VennAC |name=Herring, Julines |part=1 |volume=2 |page=358 |ref=}}</ref> a prominent local politician of [[Coventry]], who served at various times as [[mayor]] and [[sheriff]].<ref name=clarke462>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n517/mode/2up Clarke, p. 462.]</ref> The Herring family had branches in Shropshire and the 1623 [[heraldic visitation]] of Shropshire named the parent Warwickshire branch as being \"of Owsley iuxta Couentry\" in [[Warwickshire]],<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/TheVisitationOfShropshireV.28/VisitationshrophshiretAken1623_treswellVol28P1#page/n285/mode/2up ''Visitation of Shropshire'', p. 232.]</ref> which seems to be the modern [[Allesley]], a parish that was broken into smaller parts in Victorian times.

He was schooled initially at the small border village of [[More, Shropshire]] by a Mr Perkin, a close relative of his mother. [[Samuel Clarke (minister)|Samuel Clarke]], whose 1651 account is the basis for all later biographers, thought that it was from Perkin at More that Herring \"learned the Principles of Religion.\"<ref name=clarke462/> Clarke describes Perkin as a minister at ''More-chappel'' and these details have generally been accepted at face value.<ref name=odnb/> However, the [[Clergy of the Church of England database]] lists More as a [[parish church]] within the [[Diocese of Hereford]], not as a chapelry.<ref>[http://db.theclergydatabase.org.uk/jsp/locations/index.jsp?locKey=3295 CCEd Location ID: 3295.]</ref> [[Robert William Eyton|Eyton]], the pioneering historian of Shropshire, considered that More probably began as a chapelry of [[Lydbury North]] but \"became independent, at a period which the earliest Records fail to reach.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/antiquitiesshro11eytogoog#page/n320/mode/2up Eyton, p. 290.]</ref> CCEd does list some clergy at More in the 1580s and Perkin is not among them, although the database cannot be exhaustive. It does not note any parish school at More but there was one at nearby Lydbury, although records of staff seem to start only with the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]].<ref>[http://db.theclergydatabase.org.uk/jsp/locations/index.jsp?locKey=239242 CCEd Location ID: 239242.]</ref> The older [[Dictionary of National Biography]] avers that Perkin was a minister at ''Morechurch'':<ref name=dnb/> there is a Churchmoor, further east, in Lydbury North parish, but it is a hamlet with no chapel.\n\nHerring then moved to the family home at Coventry, where he attended the [[King Henry VIII School, Coventry|Free Grammar School]]. Clarke credits his academic progress there to the then headmaster, whom he names as Reverend Master Tovey.<ref name=clarke462/> Even as a schoolboy he was noted for his piety. Clarke credits him with an early interest and delight in the [[Bible]] passages that deal with faith and repentance \u2013 themes typically of great concern to [[Protestant]]s. On play days, he and a few friends engaged in prayer and religious exercises before going out.\n\nIn May 1600 Herring was admitted as a scholar to [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge]],<ref name=venn/> then a new, specifically Protestant institution. University records show he graduated [[Bachelor of Arts#United Kingdom and Ireland|BA]] in the academic year 1603-4: Clarke thought Herring returned to Coventry as a [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]].<ref name=clarke462/> There he studied [[Divinity (academic discipline)|Divinity]] with the encouragement of [[Humphrey Fenn]], a noted advocate of Presbyterianism and formerly a client of [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester]].<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=9280|title=Fenn, Humphrey|first=Jan|last=Broadway}}</ref> Fenn had been suspended from his ministry since 1590 for his activities within a Warwickshire [[classis (ecclesiastical)|classis]] within the Church of England and had not regained his vicarage of [[Holy Trinity Church, Coventry]]. Herring, however, seems to have found opportunities to preach, winning considerable approval.<ref name=brook489/><ref name=clarke462/>\n\n==Calke==\n\nHerring was approaching the age to take up a parish ministry of his own, but this required [[Holy orders#Anglicanism|ordination]]. Number 36 of the [[Canon law (Church of England)|Book of Canons]], confirmed by the [[Convocations of Canterbury and York]] in 1604 and 1606 respectively, demanded that all candidates for ordination take a three-fold oath, accepting the royal supremacy, the [[Book of Common Prayer]] and the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anglican.net/doctrines/1604-canon-law/#p1-3 |title=Constitutions and Canons Ecclesiastical, p. 3. |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=1603|website=Anglican.net |access-date= 11 January 2016 |quote=}}</ref> The subscription book of the [[Diocese of Coventry and Lichfield]], which covered the area in Herring both lived and sought a living, summarised the oath as:\n\n<blockquote>The king is the only supreme governor under God of all things spiritual as well as temporal: the Book of Common Prayer, with the ordering of bishops priests and deacons, contains nothing contrary to the word of God: the Articles of Religion (1562) are agreeable to the word of God.<ref>Coulton, p. 74.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHerring circumvented the requirement by securing ordination from an Irish bishop then visiting London. He was accompanied in this by other young Puritan men, including [[John Ball (Puritan)|John Ball]], a friend who was tutor to the children of Catherine and [[Robert Cholmondeley, 1st Earl of Leinster|Robert Cholmondley]].<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n495/mode/2up Clarke, p.441-2.]</ref> Only after the ordination were the pair able to take up their first ecclesiastical appointments: Ball as curate of [[Whitmore, Staffordshire|Whitmore]] in [[Staffordshire]]; Herring as preacher at [[Calke]] in Derbyshire.\n\n[[File:Arthur Hildersham-Samuel Clarke.jpg|thumb|left|Arthur Hildersham, Puritan preacher, from Samuel Clarke's ''Generall Martyrologie'', 1651. Woodcut, artist unknown.]]\nHerring was recommended for the post at Calke by [[Arthur Hildersham]], the vicar of [[Ashby-de-la-Zouch]], which was close by, although in [[Leicestershire]].<ref name=clarke463>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n517/mode/2up Clarke, p. 463.]</ref> In his early years he was both friend and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Hildersham,<ref>[http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/2794/1/WRAP_THESIS_Rowe_2009.pdf#235 Rowe, p. 227.]</ref> part of a generation of younger disciples that included [[Simeon Ashe]] and Hildersham's own son, Samuel.<ref>[http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/2794/1/WRAP_THESIS_Rowe_2009.pdf#162 Rowe, p. 154.]</ref> Herring was not the first member of Hilderham's circle appointed to Calke: Robert Bainbridge, the patron, had earlier installed George More, a close associate of Hildersham and of [[John Darrell]]. During the 1590s More took part in the religious exercises of the Hildersham circle, which included fasting, prayer, lectures and fellowship,<ref>[http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/2794/1/WRAP_THESIS_Rowe_2009.pdf#169 Rowe, p. 161.]</ref> and supported Darrell in the highly controversial work of [[Exorcism in Christianity|exorcism]].<ref>[http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/2794/1/WRAP_THESIS_Rowe_2009.pdf#282 Rowe, p. 274.]</ref>\n{{Wiktionary pipe|donative#English|donative}}\n\nClarke considered that Calke a relatively secure base for Herring because it was a [[Royal peculiar|peculiar jurisdiction]] exempt from episcopal authority, as well as bringing the support of a sympathetic patron. CCEd, citing a 1772 reference, makes clear that Calke was a donative, rather than a peculiar.<ref>[http://db.theclergydatabase.org.uk/jsp/locations/index.jsp?locKey=233327 CCEd Location ID: 233327.]</ref> ''[[Magna Britannia]]'', published in 1817, numbered Calke among nine Derbyshire parishes that were donatives<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/magna-britannia/vol5/xi-xvii Lysons and Lysons, p. xi-xvii.]</ref> before the Victorian abolition of these institutions. In a donative the [[advowson|patron]] had the right to make an appointment to the [[benefice#Church of England|benefice]] without reference to the [[Ordinary (officer)|ordinary]]<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/ecclesiasticalla01phil#page/252/mode/2up Phillimore, p. 252-3.]</ref> \u2013 in this case the local [[diocesan bishop]]. The church and the incumbent were exempt from ordinary jurisdiction:<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/ecclesiasticalla01phil#page/254/mode/2up Phillimore, p. 254.]</ref> in a peculiar there is an ordinary jurisdiction but it does not belong to the local bishop. Calke church was part of Calke [[manorial system|manor]] \u2013 a former monastic estate that passed into lay hands through the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]]. Although later named [[Calke Abbey]], it had actually been a very small [[Augustinian]] priory, which was absorbed as a mere cell into its own daughter house, [[Repton Priory]]: under the founder's terms, the church had been given to the canons on condition they supply it with a priest.<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/derbs/vol2/pp58-63 Page, pp. 58-63.]</ref> Robert Bainbridge bought the Calke estate in 1582<ref name=bainbridge>M.

He was a militant Protestant, three times MP for [[Derby (UK Parliament constituency)|Derby]], who was imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]] during March 1587 after he had demanded the execution of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] and supported [[Sir Anthony Cope, 1st Baronet|Anthony Cope's]] proposal for a radical reform of Church government: he and his friends made the mistake of continuing to argue outside the chamber of the House of Commons, where they were not protected by [[Parliamentary privilege in the United Kingdom|parliamentary privilege]].<ref name=bainbridge/>\n[[File:Simeon Ashe.jpg|thumb|Simeon Ashe]]\nAlthough Calke was a very small settlement, then as now, it seems to have formed an ideal base for Herring's ministry, which was primarily one of [[preaching]]. Clarke remarks that \"God was pleased to set a broad scale to his Ministry.\"<ref name=clarke463/> A clear and powerful preacher, he drew an audience from up to twenty towns and villages, with Sunday congregations in good weather so large that many were forced to cluster around the windows to hear him. Some brought picnics and made a day of it, while others bought refreshments from the \"threepenny ordinary\" provided for strangers. The impact of his preaching on the region was increased by the practice of returning home in groups, singing [[psalm]]s and discussing the [[sermon]]. Clarke thought that the effectiveness of Herring's preaching as part of the Hildersham circle was proved by the very high retention of Puritan converts in the region, who remained with the cause through the \"broken dividing times\" that followed: presumably meaning the period of [[Thorough]] or [[absolute monarchy]], the [[English Civil War]] and the [[Regicide#The regicide of Charles I of England|Regicide]]. Herring seems to have had a profound influence over Simeon Ashe, later a moderate Presbyterian preacher and an intimate of important parliamentarian leaders, including [[Robert Greville, 2nd Baron Brooke]] and [[Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester]]. Herring took the opportunity of a relatively stable period in his life to marry and start a family. His wife was Christian<ref name=odnb/> Gellibrand. The match was remembered in Puritan hagiography as a particularly happy and mutually-supportive.<ref name=clarke463/><ref>[https://archive.org/stream/livespuritansco01broogoog#page/n500/mode/2up Brook, p. 490.]</ref>\n\nHerring's ministry at Calke seems to have lasted until 1618. Clarke thought he was \"forced from thence for Nonconformity by the Prelatical power, being informed against by ill-affected men.\"<ref name=clarke463/> He gives no details of how Herring could be removed from a donative. Barbara Coulton, a recent historian of Shrewsbury during this the period, gives 1617 as the year Herring was recruited by William Rowley of Shrewsbury,<ref name=coulton75>Coulton, p. 75.</ref> suggesting that he was attracted by a more influential post rather than driven out of Calke. This is supported by the baptism of Christian, a daughter of Herring, at [[St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury]] as early as 1 February 1618.<ref>Coulton, p. 76.</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/stream/shropshireparish15lichshro#page/4/mode/2up ''St Chad's parish register'', Volume 1, p. 4.]</ref> Herring's patron Bainbridge must by this time have been elderly, as he first sat in the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] in 1571.<ref name=bainbridge/> He may have been in financial difficulties: although he had a vault prepared for his burial at Calke, he sold the estate only three years after Herring's departure and died before July 1623.\n\n==Shrewsbury==\n\nIn 1618 Herring took up residence in Shrewsbury, at the invitation of the corporation, as lecturer at St Alkmund's Church. This was not an incumbency: the vicar of St Alkmund's throughout Herring's time in Shrewsbury was Thomas Lloyd, who had been appointed in 1607.<ref name=ob279>[https://archive.org/stream/historyofshrewsb02owen#page/278/mode/2up Owen and Blakeway, p. 279.]</ref> Lloyd was held in no great regard as a preacher and was paid \u00a35 to read [[Morning Prayer (Anglican)|Morning Prayer]].<ref name=coulton78>Coulton, p. 78.</ref> Herring's lectureship did not require an oath before the bishop, as it was privately funded by a \u00a320 annuity. This was provided by [[Rowland Heylyn]], a merchant of Welsh ancestry, educated at [[Shrewsbury School]] and a former parishioner of St Alkmund's, who had become immensely wealthy and powerful in the [[Worshipful Company of Ironmongers]] in London.<ref name=coulton75/> Heylyn had two sisters living in Shrewsbury, Ann and Eleanor, who were married respectively to John Nicholls and Richard Hunt, powerful local politicians who were associates of William Rowley, described by Clarke as \"a wise religious man.\"<ref name=clarke464>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n519/mode/2up Clarke, p. 464.]</ref> It was Rowley who made the initial approach to Herring and acted throughout as his \"faithful friend.\" It seems that he initially accommodated the Herring family in his own mansion.<ref name=coulton78/> Rowley was a member of Shrewsbury's powerful [[Shrewsbury Drapers Company|Drapers' Company]] and Hunt was its warden.<ref name=coulton79>Coulton, p. 79.</ref> The company's hall was vacant and it was probably they who prevailed on the members to lease it to Herring for \u00a34 annually, the company reserving the right to use it for meetings but agreeing to pay for repairs.<ref name=ob279n4>[https://archive.org/stream/historyofshrewsb02owen#page/278/mode/2up Owen and Blakeway, p. 279-80, note 4.]</ref>\n\nHerring was obliged to preach twice weekly: on Tuesday morning and at 1 pm on Sunday. This was to avoid offending the other clergy in the town by poaching their congregations.<ref name=clarke464/> In addition, he repeated the Sunday sermon that evening, alternating between the houses of three powerful Puritan merchants: Edward Jones, George Wright and Rowley. A specimen of his preaching, showing his [[hermeneutic]] method at the service of his Puritan audience, runs:\n:{{Bibleverse|1 Corinthians|3:22b|KJV}}: ''All are yours.''\n\n<blockquote>Yours! Whose meaneth the apostle by ''yours''? The Christian Corinths, to whome this epistle was directed, and those words. And what meaneth hee by the word ''all''. The verse itself shewes you. \"Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, \u2013 or life, or death, or things present, or things to come, ''All are yours.''\" And the expression is of a further latitude, v. 21. for all ''things'' are yours. All things therefore are the true Christian's. This is the truth that I am to teach you. Therefore, without any further coherence of these words with the former, or resolving the text into parts, (which is the ordinarie course of ministers,)  I must fall upon this; \u2013 all things are the true Christian's.<ref name=ob279n4/></blockquote>\n\n[[File:ThomasMorton.jpg|thumb|Thomas Morton]]\n\nHerring was subject to attack and controversy on both sides, conservative and radical, during his preaching ministry at Shrewsbury. As early as 1620, just after [[Thomas Morton (bishop)|Thomas Morton]] became Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, Herring was reported to the authorities for failure to use the prayer book and to receive or administer the sacraments.<ref name=odnb/> Morton had clashed with Puritan clergy in his former [[Diocese of Chester]] over ceremonial practices and the [[Declaration of Sports]]. His response had been [[eirenic]] in spirit,<ref name=coulton79/> if sometimes exacting and abrasive in person: he had, for example, given [[Thomas Paget (Puritan minister)|Thomas Paget]], a leading Lancashire Puritan minister, 10 shillings towards his legal expenses after compelling him to appear with a list of written arguments against signing with the cross in [[Infant baptism|baptism]].<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/defenceofchurchg00page#page/n13/mode/2up Thomas Paget, ''An Humble Advertisment (sic) to the high Court of Parliament'' p. 8. in John Paget: ''A Defence Of Church-Government, Exercised in Presbyteriall, Classicall, & Synodall Assemblies''.]</ref> Morton referred Herring to two neighbouring ministers for satisfaction and he made a written statement of his reservations. The two ministers supported Herring with a certificate to the bishop and he pronounced himself satisfied with Herring's integrity. However, the incident opened up a series of suspensions and reinstatements.<ref name=clarke465>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n519/mode/2up Clarke p. 465.]</ref> It seems that he continued to conduct private fasts and Bible expositions even during periods when his public ministry was made impossible. These would have been held in Draper's Hall, which was his own home.<ref name=coulton82>Coulton, p. 82.</ref>\n\nOpposition to Herring coalesced around Peter Studley, who was incumbent or [[curate]] of St Chad's from 1622<ref>Coulton, p. 80.</ref> and also took responsibility for St Julian's, which was very close.<ref name=coulton82/> His appointment seems to reflect the emergence on the corporation of a conservative opposition, which was able to appoint a second lecturer to St Alkmund's: Samuel Greaves, the [[rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] of [[Berrington, Shropshire|Berrington]], who preached on Wednesday mornings for \u00a310 a year.<ref name=coulton83>Coulton, p. 83.</ref> An [[canonical visitation|episcopal visitation]] of 1626, possibly attended by Morton himself, found Studley at loggerheads with the town's Puritans and many of the complaints and counter-claims were directly related to Herring's preaching ministry. The congregation of St Julian's were up in arms because, they alleged, Studley deliberately timed services to prevent them attending preaching elsewhere, but refrained from preaching himself. Studley reported Rowley and Wright for holding preaching and prayer meetings in their homes on Sunday evenings, suggesting that the episcopal court should judge whether or not these constituted [[conventicle]]s.<ref name=coulton82/> However, Studley was also meeting fierce opposition from a more radical group of poorer parishioners, of whom the most prominent were [[Katherine Chidley]] and her family.<ref name=coulton83/> Chidley had led a group of women in refusing to take part in the [[churching of women]], which some Puritans found offensive and for which Studley demanded a fee. She arrived through her experiences at separatist conclusions and was later to write in justification of [[Independent (religion)|Independent]] or [[Congregationalist polity|Congregationalist]] tendency within Puritanism. Herring was opposed to this group, and Clarke reports his frequent observation:\n\n<blockquote>It is a sin of an high nature to unchurch a Nation at once, and that this would become the spring of many other fearful errours, for separation will eat like a Gangrene into the heart of Godlinesse. And he did pray, that they who would un-church others, might not be un-christianed themselves.<ref name=clarke465/></blockquote>\n\nHerring's opposition to separatism was also made manifest by his attendance at his local parish church, even though he had an appointment in a neighbouring parish. He attended the [[Eucharist|Lord's Supper]] at [[St Mary's Church, Shrewsbury|St Mary's]], a royal peculiar<ref name=coulton82/> that was effectively controlled by the corporation. The vicar on Herring's arrival was William Bright, a nominee of the Puritan divine [[Laurence Chaderton]],<ref>Coulton, p. 77.</ref> and congenial to Herring. However, Bright died in October 1618 and was buried on the 29th of that month.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/shropshireparish12lichshro#page/56/mode/2up St Mary's parish register, p. 56.]</ref> He was replaced, on Chaderton's recommendation,<ref name=coulton79/> with [[Samuel Browne (divine)|Samuel Browne]], a more moderate figure who nevertheless stoutly defended his church against episcopal interference.<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=3696|title=Browne, Samuel|first=Elizabeth|last=Allen}}</ref> On 19 January 1620, the St Mary's parish register records the burial of \"A sonn, being not baptized, of Mr. Hearing, a Mynester of God's word.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/shropshireparish12lichshro#page/58/mode/2up St Mary's parish register, p. 58.]</ref>  Later in the same year, on 17 December, the register records a baptism: \"Samuell, s. of Mr. Hearing, preacher of the Word.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/shropshireparish12lichshro#page/58/mode/2up St Mary's parish register, p. 59.]</ref> These descriptions suggest concord between Browne and Herring.<ref name=coulton79/> Moreover, for the baptism of Dorcas on 30 January 1623 Herring is again described as a preacher of the Word,<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/shropshireparish12lichshro#page/62/mode/2up St Mary's parish register, p. 63.]</ref> and for Mary's on 6 February 1625 as \"Mynester,\" while Browne himself is described in the entry for his own daughter's baptism as \"publique preacher.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/shropshireparish12lichshro#page/66/mode/2up St Mary's parish register, p. 67.]</ref> This suggests a looseness of terminology and a sense of equality and respect between the two clerics. The baptisms of two more children chart Herring's residence in the parish: for Joanna's on 19 August 1627 he is simply \"Mr. Jolynus Hearing.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/shropshireparish12lichshro#page/72/mode/2up St Mary's parish register, p. 72.]</ref> However, after Browne's death in 1632 and the appointment of the Puritan James Betton to St Mary's,<ref name=coulton86/> the entry for Herring's son Theophilus on 5 September 1633 again uses the title \"Minister\".<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/shropshireparish12lichshro#page/82/mode/2up St Mary's parish register, p. 82.]</ref> As he continued a valued parishioner of St Mary's, Herring's position at St Alkmund's also became more secure. Heylyn operated through a group of Puritan ministers and businessmen who had established a body known as the [[Feoffees for Impropriations]]s, sometimes known as the Collectors of [[St Antholin, Budge Row|St Antholin]],<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/historyofshrewsb02owen#page/270/mode/2up Owen and Blakeway, p. 271-2.]</ref> to channel funds into Puritan preaching. Heylyn became a feoffee in 1626 and two years later oversaw the acquisition of the [[advowson]] of St Alkmund's and a lease on the tithes of St Mary's.<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=13172|title=Heylyn, Rowland|first=Marc L.|last=Schwarz}}</ref> His distance from any radicalism strengthened his position, so that it was admitted even by his enemies:\n\n<blockquote>Though he be scrupulous in matter of ceremony, yet he is a loyal subject unto the King, and a true friend unto the state.<ref name=clarke464/></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Worfield - Margaret Bromley 01.JPG|thumb|Effigy of Lady Margaret Bromley, [[Worfield]].]]\n\nHerring continued to make and maintain links with moderate Presbyterian preachers in the region and beyond, gaining recognition for Shrewsbury as the centre of a Puritan network.<ref name=odnb/> He brought his brother-in-law, Robert Nicolls of [[Wrenbury]], and Thomas Pierson of [[Brampton Bryan]] to preach in the town.<ref name=clarke464/> It is possible that Samuel Clarke, Herring's biographer, also visited Shrewsbury.<ref>Coulton p. 84.</ref> Along with John Ball, Pierson, Nicolls and Herring were part of a group who met for religious exercises in [[Sheriffhales]] at the home of Lady [[Margaret Bromley]],<ref name=clarke469>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n523/mode/2up Clarke, p. 469.]</ref> widow from 1626 of the noted judge [[Edward Bromley|Sir Edward Bromley]].<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/TheVisitationOfShropshireV.28/VisitationshrophshiretAken1623_treswellVol28P1#page/n131/mode/2up ''Visitation of Shropshire'', p. 78.]</ref>\n[[File:William Laud.jpg|thumb|left|William Laud]]\nDuring the 1630s the bitterness of religious conflict at Shrewsbury intensified to a pitch that brought national attention and made Herring's position precarious. [[Robert Wright (bishop)|Bishop Wright's]] visitation of the town provided Studley with an opportunity for a triumphal reading  of ordinances on the decoration of churches, but also for a denunciation of his opponents that revealed the depth of opposition. Herring's supporters, Rowley and Wright, were now joined by [[Humphrey Mackworth (Parliamentarian)|Humphrey Mackworth]] as leaders of a group that refused to bow at the Name of Jesus and to kneel for communion, and so were counted as refusers of the Eucharist.<ref>Coulton, p. 85.</ref> Studley went on to write a savage denunciation of Puritanism, ''The Looking-Glass of Schisme'', claiming that religious nonconformity had influenced the commission of sensational murders at Clun.<ref name=coulton86>Coulton, p. 86.</ref> The furore in Shrewsbury attracted the attention of [[William Laud]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] himself. Laud Proposed to use negotiations over the renewal of the town's charter to prize the town's main churches free of the corporation's control.<ref>Coulton, p. 87.</ref> He acknowledged Herring's role in the town's opposition with the comment: \"I will pickle up that Herring of Shrewsbury.\" Herring's response is reported as:\n\n<blockquote>If he will abuse his power, let it teach Christians the more to use their prayers. And be then prayed that the Non-conformists enemies might by observation that they have a good God to trust unto, when trampled upon by ill-despised men.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n521/mode/2up Clarke, p. 466.]</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nLaud instituted a visitation of the entire [[Province of Canterbury]] in 1635, with [[Nathaniel Brent]] conducting enquiries in the Lichfield diocese. Brent suspended Puritans at [[St Peter's Collegiate Church]] in Wolverhampton, before moving on to Shrewsbury, where he also came into conflict with local clergy.<ref name=coulton88>Coulton, p. 88.</ref> At some point in the early part of 1635 Herring and his family left Shrewsbury.\n\n==Wrenbury==\n[[File:St Margarets Wrenbury.jpg|thumb|St Margaret's Church Wrenbury, where Nicolls and Peartree were incumbents.]]\nHerring sought a home first in [[Wrenbury]], [[Cheshire]], where his wife's sister lived: Robert Nicolls, her husband and Herring's friend, had died at Sheriffhales in 1630.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/livespuritansco01broogoog#page/n386/mode/2up Brook, p. 375.]</ref> Wrenbury had originally been part of the parish of [[St Mary's Church, Acton]], and its church was still in the gift of the vicar of Acton.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/historicalsketch00urwi#page/138/mode/2up Urwick, p. 138.]</ref> The incumbent was William Peartree of [[Bury St Edmunds]], who had been suspended by Brent.<ref name=coulton88/> Herring had no formal appointment but lived privately as a parishioner, offering pastoral support by \"comforting afflicted consciences.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n521/mode/2up Clarke, p. 467.]</ref> Clarke claimed that Herring only moved to Wrenbury after despairing of his future in Shrewsbury, but it seems that he had not taken steps formally to terminate his lectureship or even his tenancy. On 14 April 1635 the Drapers' Company resolved to write to Herring about rent arrears of \u00a34 and to enquire whether he proposed to take up residence and preach before [[Midsummer]], after which time they would let his house to \"some brother of the company.\" It was duly leased on 17 September to John Betton, a draper.<ref name=ob279n4/>\n\n==Amsterdam==\n[[File:Tekening van kerk en begijnhof - Amsterdam - 20407839 - RCE.jpg|thumb|17th century print of the exterior of the English Reformed Church, from ''Beschrijvinge van Amsterdam'' by Tobias van Domselaer (1611-85).]]\nThis was a time of indecision for Herring. He received invitations to leave for [[New England]] but felt it was not for him.<ref name=clarke468>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n523/mode/2up Clake, p. 468.]</ref> His reservations may have been connected with a letter Herring and thirteen other Puritan clerics sent in 1637 to ministers in New England, which raised the alarm about separatism among them.<ref name=odnb/> However, towards the end of 1636, some friends put forward his name to John Rulice or Rulitius, then a pastor<ref name=steven279>[https://archive.org/stream/historyscottish00stevgoog#page/n310/mode/2up Steven, p. 279.]</ref> of the [[English Reformed Church, Amsterdam]]. Rulice had been sent to London to find someone who might take over the responsibilities of [[John Paget (Puritan minister)|John Paget]],<ref name=clarke468/> the church's first pastor, now [[emeritus]]. The opportunity faced Herring with numerous issues and conflicts. Not only was he concerned to be leaving family and friends: he had a vast library of records, that might incriminate them, but were of great personal and religious value to himself and his cause. After much deliberation, he burnt most of this collection, fearing a search of his person ''en route'' or of his home after he had left. This he described as that \"Lesser martyrdom, wherein many of the best thoughts of his dearest friends were committed to flames.\" He was then forced to plan a secret journey, as Laud had forbidden clergy to travel abroad without a licence.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n523/mode/2up Clarke, pp. 469-70.]</ref> After arranging a passage from [[Great Yarmouth|Yarmouth]], he made a will on 24 August 1637, leaving bequests for his wife and eight children. He then visited his sisters and set off for the coast with a brother-in-law, Oliver Bowles of [[Sutton, Bedfordshire]]. He avoided interception, reaching [[Rotterdam]] on 20 September and taking a wagon to Amsterdam the following day.<ref name=clarke470>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n525/mode/2up Clarke, p. 470.]</ref> He moved in with a friend, Whittaker, pending the arrival of his family and his remaining property.\n\nHerring delivered his first sermon on {{Bibleverse|Psalms|24:1|KJV}}: \"The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.\" This met with great approval, securing his acceptance by the congregation. This paved the way for ratification by the Consistory of [[Holland]] and the [[Classis (ecclesiastical)|Classis]] of Amsterdam. From the outset, he took a full part in the liturgy and culture of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], keeping the fast decreed by the [[States General of the Netherlands]] for the success of the army at the [[Siege of Breda (1637)|Siege of Breda]]. The arrival of his family the following day was a further relief, allowing him to commit himself to the post. He was joined after a couple of years by Thomas Paget, John's brother, who also took preaching and pastoral responsibilities at the English Reformed Church.\n\nAmsterdam, then central to the wealth and culture of the [[Dutch Golden Age]] and a Protestant stronghold forged and tested in the [[Dutch Revolt]] and [[Thirty Years' war]], gave Herring at last an unrivalled platform. He was now part of a functioning presbyterian system,<ref name=odnb/> complete with a collegial ministry, much as he and moderate Puritans, like himself and the Pagets, had demanded for England. He was able to pronounce more or less freely on the situation at home, where [[Charles I of Scotland|Charles I's]] absolute monarchy ran into the crisis of the [[Bishops' War]], a prelude to the civil war in England. He prayed and spoke out for the establishment of a Presbyterian polity in England. He made a sharp distinction between the persons of the bishops, to whom he had no enmity, and their \"Pride and Prelatical rule.\"<ref name=clarke471>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n525/mode/2up Clarke, p. 471.]</ref> He continued to stress a middle position, troubled by the many fissile Independent and [[Baptist]] sects among the English exile community<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/historyscottish00stevgoog#page/n300/mode/2up Steven, pp. 269-272.]</ref> in the Netherlands. When one of his sons returned to England, presumably around 1643, he warned him not to take part in any subversion of Presbyterian polity, saying \"I am sure it is the Government of Jesus Christ.\"<ref name=clarke471/>\n[[File:Passage of Newburn Ford.jpg|thumb|Victorian impression of the 1640 Scottish incursion into England.]]\nIn 1640 he welcomed the invasion of northern England by a Scottish [[Covenanter]] army expressing the hope that the Scots \"might be instruments of much good, but of no blood nor division between the two Nations.\" Clarke describes him as \"one of God's special Remembrancers, in behalf of England, begging fervently that the Lords and Commons in Parliament, might be preserved from the two destructive rocks of pride and self-interest.\" In May 1642, Lloyd died, leaving a vacancy at St Alkmund's. The Puritan party in Shrewsbury, headed by Rowley and Mackworth, invited Herring back to resume his ministry but he probably declined.<ref>Coulton, p. 90.</ref> In the event, the corporation proved supine at the commencement of hostilities and a [[Cavalier|royalist]] ''coup'' led by [[Francis Ottley]] allowed the king's field army to occupy Shrewsbury on 20 September.<ref>Coulton, p. 91-2.</ref> The next stage of campaigning led to the major but indecisive [[Battle of Edgehill]], which Herring greeted with the prayer:\n\n<blockquote>Oh Lord wilt thou write Englands Reformation in red letters of her own blood; yet preserve thine own People, and maintaine thine own cause for Iesus Christs sake.<ref name=clarke471/></blockquote>\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Samuel Clarke (minister).jpg|thumb|right|Samuel Clarke, biographer: a 1650 engraving attributed to [[Thomas Cross (engraver)|Thomas Cross]].]]\nHerring seems to have entered into a long illness and he was clearly troubled by periods of doubt as well as suffering, in the language of the time assaults by Satan.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/ageneralmartyro00clargoog#page/n527/mode/2up Clarke, p. 472.]</ref> His last reported words, after such a period of uncertainty, were: \"He is overcome, overcome, through the strength of my Lord and only Saviour Iesus, unto whom I am now going to keep a Sabbath in glory.\" He died the following morning, given by Clarke as Sunday 28 March 1644. The date is widely<ref name=odnb/><ref name=dnb/><ref>[https://archive.org/stream/livespuritansco01broogoog#page/n502/mode/2up Brook, p. 492.]</ref> but not universally accepted. William Steven in 1833 calculated Herring's ministry as lasting eight years from 1637, which implies he died in 1645.<ref name=steven279/> Coulton in 2010 noted that the corporation of Shrewsbury wrote to Herring again asking him to return, apparently in 1645, some months after the town fell to [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] forces.<ref>Coulton, p. 105.</ref> The corporation's invitation seems inconsistent with a death in 1644. Coulton is noncommital about the actual date, but points out that the register of the English Reformed Church shows he was certainly dead by 18 May 1645. The parishioners of Chad's parish in Shrewsbury subsequently switched their attention to Thomas Paget, Herring's co-pastor at Amsterdam, and in 1646 elected him their minister.<ref>Coulton, p. 106.</ref> Herring's will was proved by Christian, his widow on 26 March 1646.<ref name=odnb/>\n\nSamuel Clarke's biography of Herring, part of a set of Puritan studies appended to his ''Generall Martyrologie'', appeared as early as 1651, under the [[Commonwealth of England]], and is informed by many who knew Herring.\n\n==Marriage and family==\n\nHerring married Christian Gellibrand during the time he was preaching at Calke.  She was the third daughter of an English preacher who had served at [[Vlissingen]], and a granddaughter of John Oxenbridge, a celebrated Warwickshire Puritan minister:<ref name=clarke463/> hence she was a cousin of the [[John Oxenbridge]] who was a notable minister at [[Boston]], Massachusetts.  Christian outlived her husband by some years and was still alive and evidently in good standing with the Reformed community in 1651, when Clarke published his biography. One of her sisters married Robert Nicolls, minister at Wrenbury, another married Oliver Bowles of Sutton, Bedfordshire, and a third married one Barry of [[Cottesmore, Rutland]]. These all formed part of the Puritan network which helped sustain Herring's ministry.\n\nJulines and Christian Herring had 13 children,<ref name=clarke464/> although some are known to have died and only eight are mentioned in Juline's will. A son, Jonathan, seems to have preceded the children born at Shrewsbury: it may have been he who reached the Netherlands with or earlier than his father, as Herring had a son with him before the rest of the family arrived.<ref name=clarke470/> Clarke considered it a mark of enlightened and loving upbringing that, before disciplining his children, Herring explained to them the nature of any wrong they had done.\n\n==Mapping Julines Herring's life==\n\n<div style=\"clear: both;

Since 1870, the Church of Ireland has designated St Patrick's as the national cathedral for the whole of Ireland, drawing chapter members from each of the twelve [[List of Church of Ireland dioceses|dioceses]] of the Church of Ireland. The [[Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|dean]] is the [[Ordinary (officer)|ordinary]] for the cathedral; this office has existed since 1219. The most famous office holder was [[Jonathan Swift]].\n\n===Status===\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2012}}\n\n[[File:presidentspew.jpg|thumb|250px|State pew of the [[President of Ireland]], still retains a British Standard carving on the front]]\nThere is almost no precedent for a two-cathedral city, and some believe it was intended that St Patrick's, a secular (diocesan clergy who are not members of a religious order, i.e. under a rule and, therefore, \"regular\") cathedral, would replace Christ Church, a cathedral managed by an order.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nA confrontational situation persisted, with considerable tension, over the decades after the establishment of St Patrick's, and was eventually settled, more-or-less, by the signing of a six-point agreement of 1300, ''Pacis Compositio''. Still extant, and in force until 1870, it provided that:\n* The consecration and enthronement of the Archbishop of Dublin was to take place at Christ Church \u2013 records show that this provision was not always followed, with many archbishops enthroned in both, and at least two in Saint Patrick's only\n* Christ Church had formal precedence, as the mother and senior cathedral of the diocese\n* Christ Church was to retain the cross, mitre and ring of each deceased Archbishop of Dublin\n* Deceased Archbishops of Dublin were to be buried alternately in each of the two cathedrals, unless they personally willed otherwise\n* The annual consecration of chrism oil for the diocese was to take place at Christ Church\n* The two cathedrals were to act as one, and shared equally in their freedoms.\n\nOver the following centuries, the two cathedrals functioned together in the diocese, until in the period of disestablishment of the Church of Ireland, the current designation of one as the ''cathedral of Dublin and Glendalough'', and one as the ''National Cathedral'', was developed.\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-Reformation period===\n[[File:St Patrick's Cathedral Choir, Dublin, Ireland - Diliff.jpg |thumb|right|The choir of St Patrick's Cathedral]]\n\nIn 1192, [[John Comyn (archbishop)|John Comyn]], first Anglo-Norman [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Archbishop of Dublin]], elevated one of the four Dublin Celtic parish churches, this one dedicated to [[Saint Patrick]], beside a holy well of the same name and on an island between two branches of the [[River Poddle]], to the status of a collegiate church, i.e., a church with a body of clergy devoted to both worship and learning. The new collegiate church fell outside the City boundaries, and this move created two new civic territories, one under the Archbishop's temporal jurisdiction. The church was dedicated to \"God, our Blessed Lady Mary and St Patrick\" on 17 March 1191.<ref>Bernard, 1924: p. 8</ref>\n\nComyn's charter of 1191 or 1192, which allowed for a chapter of thirteen canons, of which three held special dignities (as Chancellor, Precentor and Treasurer), was confirmed by a [[Papal Bull]] (of [[Pope Celestine III]]) within a year. The thirteen [[prebendaries]] attached to the church were provided with archepiscopal lands.\n\nOver time, a whole complex of buildings arose in the vicinity of the cathedral, including the Palace of the St Sepulchre (seat of the Archbishop), and legal jurisdiction was divided between a Liberty controlled by the Dean, around the cathedral, and a larger one belonging to the Archbishop, adjacent.\n\nWhile it is not clear when precisely the church was further raised to the status of cathedral, a unique move in a city with an existing cathedral, it was probably after 1192, and Comyn's successor as Archbishop, [[Henry de Loundres]], was elected in 1212 by the chapters of both Christ Church and St Patrick's, this election being recognised by [[Pope Innocent III]]. See below for more on the question of status. Henry granted a number of further charters to the Cathedral and Chapter between 1218 and 1220, and one of these in 1220 created the office of Dean to head the Cathedral,<ref>Bernard, 1924: p. 9</ref> the right of election being allocated solely to the canons of the Chapter.\n\nThe basis of the present building, as noted, the largest church in Ireland, was built between 1191 and 1270, though little now remains of the earliest work beyond the Baptistry. Much of the work was overseen by the previously mentioned Henry of London, a friend of the King of England and signatory of the [[Magna Carta]], who was also involved in the construction of Dublin's city walls, and [[Dublin Castle]].\n\nAn order from [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]] in 1225 allowed the collection of donations from across the island for reconstruction for a period of four years, and the work, in the Early English [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style, lasted at least until rededication in 1254. The [[Lady Chapel]] was added around 1270.<ref>Bernard, 1924: pp. 9\u201310</ref>\n\nIn 1300, [[Richard de Ferings|Archbishop Ferings]] of Dublin arranged an agreement between the two cathedrals, the ''Pacis Compositio'', which acknowledged both as cathedrals and made some provision to accommodate their shared status.<ref>Bernard, 1924: pp. 73\u201374</ref> For more, see ''Status'' below.\n\nIn 1311 the [[Medieval University of Dublin]] was founded here with [[William de Rodyard]], Dean of St Patrick's, as its first Chancellor, and the Canons as its members. It never flourished, and was suppressed at the [[Reformation]].\n\nFrom the mid-14th century, and for over 500 years, the north [[transept]] of the building was used as the parish church of [[Church of St Nicholas Without, (Church of Ireland)|St Nicholas Without]] (i.e. the part of the Parish of St Nicholas outside the city proper).\n\nThe tower (Minot's Tower) and west [[nave]] were rebuilt between 1362 and 1370, following a fire. The name commemorates [[Thomas Minot]], [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Archbishop of Dublin]] 1363\u201375, who oversaw the rebuilding.\n\nFrom the very earliest years there were problems with seepage of water, with a number of floods, especially in the later years of the 18th century, caused by the surrounding branches of the River Poddle \u2013 even in the 20th century, it is reported that the water table was within 2.3 metres (7.5&nbsp;feet) of the floor.<ref>Bernard, 1924: p. 10, note 3</ref> This situation ensured there would never be a crypt or basement area.<ref>Bernard, 1924: p. 10</ref>\n\n===Reformation period===\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2012|reason=Only one citation and that appears only to support a single clause of text about the 1555 charter}}\n[[File:St. Patrick's Jones memorial.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Memorial to [[Thomas Jones (Archbishop)|Thomas Jones]], Dean of St Patrick's from 1581 to 1585]]\n\nAfter the [[English Reformation]] (an uneven process between 1536 and 1564 but at St Patrick's, effective from about 1537), St Patrick's became an [[Anglican]] [[Church of Ireland]] church. Most Dubliners followed the same line. In the 1530s some images within the cathedral were defaced by soldiers under [[Thomas Cromwell]],{{clarify|date=October 2016}} and neglect led to collapse of the nave in 1544. The conventionally-flexible style of the Archbishop of Dublin [[Hugh Curwen]] is instructive; he was a follower firstly of Henry's non-Reformed church in the 1530s, then of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI's]] full-blown Protestantism c.1550, then accepting his appointment as archbishop during [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary's]] reversion of the church to [[Roman Catholicism]] in 1555, and continued to serve as the archbishop, using the Anglican rite from 1559, under [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] until 1567.\n\nUnder [[King Edward VI]], St Patrick's Cathedral was formally suppressed, and the building demoted back to the status of parish church. On 25 April 1547, a pension of 200 marks sterling was assigned to \"Sir Edward Basnet\", the Dean, followed, some months later, by pensions of \u00a360 each to Chancellor Alien and Precentor Humphrey, and \u00a340 to Archdeacon Power. The silver, jewels, and ornaments were transferred to the Dean and Chapter of Christ Church. The King designated part of the building for use as a court house, the Cathedral Grammar School was established in the then vicar's hall and the deanery given to the archbishop, following the transfer of the Archbishop's Palace to the Lord Deputy of Ireland. In 1549, it was further ordered that the walls be repainted and inscribed with passages from the scriptures.\n\nIn 1555 a charter of the joint monarchs [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]] and [[Mary I of England|Mary]] restored the cathedral's privileges<ref>Bernard, 1924: p. 13</ref> and initiated restoration and a late document of Queen Mary's reign, a deed dated 27 April 1558, comprises a release or receipt by Thomas Leverous, the new Dean, and the Chapter of St Patrick's, of the \"goods, chattels, musical instruments, etc.\", belonging to the Cathedral, and which had been in the possession of the Dean and Chapter of Christ Church. It was during this reign that the patronal festival of the Blessed Virgin Mary was last celebrated (in 1558).\n\nFollowing the ejection of the Catholic chapter of canons in 1559, the Catholic community continued in the 1560s\u20131570s at least to go on nominating canons and the principal dignitaries to St Patrick's.\n\nIn 1560, one of Dublin's first public clocks was erected in \"St Patrick's Steeple\".\n\n===17th century===\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2012}}\n[[File:St Patrick's Cathedral Lady Chapel, Dublin, Ireland - Diliff.jpg|thumb|Lady Chapel in Saint Patrick's Cathedral today.]]\nBy the early 17th century, the Lady Chapel was said to have been in ruins, and the arch at the east end of the choir was closed off by a lath and plaster partition wall. There was also routine flooding and a series of galleries was added to accommodate large congregations. In 1620 the English-born judge [[Luke Gernon]]  referred to the Cathedral's poor state of repair.<ref>Gernon, Luke  ''A Discourse of Ireland'' 1620 edited by C.S Falkiner 1904</ref>\n\nDuring the stay of [[Oliver Cromwell]] in Dublin, during his [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|conquest of Ireland]] the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]]'s [[Lord Protector]] stabled his horses in the nave of the cathedral. This was intended to demonstrate Cromwell's disrespect for the [[Anglican]] religion, which he associated with [[Roman Catholicism]] and political [[Cavalier|Royalism]].\n\nAfter the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, repairs to the building were begun.\n\nIn 1666, the Cathedral Chapter offered the Lady Chapel for the use of French-speaking [[Huguenots]] who had fled to Ireland, and after some repair and preparation works, it became known as ''L'Eglise Fran\u00e7aise de St Patrick''. A lease was signed on 23 December 1665 and was renewed from time to time until the special services ceased in 1816, by which time the Huguenots had been fully assimilated into the city population.\n\nIn 1668 the roof, in danger of collapsing, was taken down, a new roof being completed by 1671. Buttresses were erected and the west window was replaced with a perpendicular window. Then, in the 1680s, the choir was reformed. In 1688\u201390, during the [[Williamite War in Ireland]], [[James II of England|James II]] and his fellow [[Roman Catholic|Catholics]] briefly repossessed St Patrick's. James attended [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] services there with his [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] supporters for a time.{{clarify|date=July 2017}} However, the victory of the Protestant Williamites in this war meant that the cathedral was restored to Anglican ownership in 1690 when James abandoned Dublin after his defeat at the [[Battle of the Boyne]].\n\n===18th century===\n[[File:St. Patrick's Cathedral Swift bust.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Bust of [[Jonathan Swift]]]]\n[[File:Dublin, St.Patrick's Cathedral plan.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Mid 18th century floor plan]]\nThroughout its long history the cathedral has contributed much to Irish life, and one key aspect of this relates to the writer and satirist [[Jonathan Swift]], author of ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', who was [[Dean (Christianity)|Dean]] of the cathedral from 1713 to 1745. Many of his famous sermons and \"Irish tracts\" (such as the ''[[Drapier's Letters]]'') were given during his stay as Dean.<ref>''History of St Patrick's Cathedral'' by Monck Mason</ref>\n\nHis grave and [[epitaph]] can be seen in the cathedral, along with those of his friend Stella. Swift took a great interest in the building, its services and music and in what would now be called social welfare, funding an almshouse for poor women and Saint Patrick's Hospital.\n\nThe Choir School, which had been founded in 1432, supplied many of its members to take part in the very first performance of [[Handel]]'s [[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]] in 1742.\n\nIn 1749, the cathedral spire was added by [[George Semple]]; it remains one of Dublin's landmarks.\n\nIn 1792, divine service was temporarily suspended due to the poor condition of the south wall, then 60 centimetres (2&nbsp;feet) out of perpendicular, and of parts of the roof.\n\n====Chivalric chapels====\n* Knights of St Patrick. From 1783 until 1871 the cathedral served as the Chapel of the Most Illustrious [[Order of Saint Patrick]], members of which were the Knights of St Patrick. With the dis-establishment of the Church of Ireland in 1871 the installation ceremony moved to [[St. Patrick's Hall (Dublin)|St Patrick's Hall]], [[Dublin Castle]]. The heraldic banners of the knights at the time of the change still hang over the choir stalls to this day.\n* ''Paris-Malta obedience'' of the [[Order of Saint Lazarus (statuted 1910)]]. The Cathedral contains the so-called ''Dunsany''{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Chapel which is the spiritual home of the order in Ireland. The decoration of the chapel was provided for by Randall Plunkett, 19th [[Baron of Dunsany|Lord Dunsany]], who established the order in Ireland in 1962. The cathedral is used for its [[investiture]] ceremonies and the Dean of the Cathedral is an Ecclesiastical [[Commander (order)|Commander]] of the order.\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:St. Patrick's Cathedral stones.jpg|thumb|left|Celtic cross discovered near the church in the 19th century.]]\n[[File:Dublin St. Patrick's Cathedral Statue of Sir Benjamin Lee Guinness 2012 09 26.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Bronze statue of Sir Benjamin Lee Guinness by John Henry Foley, erected in 1875.<ref>{{cite book |last=Casey |first=Christine |title=The Buildings of Ireland: Dublin |isbn=978-0-300-10923-8 |page=606 |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2005}}</ref>]]\nBy 1805, the north transept was in ruins and the south transept was in a poor condition; urgent work was carried out to the nave roof, held up by scaffolding.\n\nIn 1846, the post of Dean of Saint Patrick's was united with that of Dean of Christ Church, a situation which lasted in law until 1872.\n\nAn attempt at major restoration began under the direction of Dean Pakenham (Dean, 1843\u20131864), limited by poor economic circumstances. The Lady Chapel was restored, the floor (then raised several metres) reduced to its original level and other urgent matters were at least partly addressed.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, a Celtic cross was found buried near the cathedral. This has been preserved and it is thought it may have marked the site of the former holy well.\n\nThe major reconstruction, paid for by [[Benjamin Guinness]], in 1860\u201365, and inspired by the fear that the cathedral was in imminent danger of collapse, means that much of the current building and decoration dates from the [[Victorian era]]; medieval [[Chantry|chantries]] were removed among other actions, and few records of the work survive today.\n\nThough the rebuilding ensured the survival of the Cathedral, the failure to preserve records of the scale of the rebuild means that little is known as to how much of the current building is genuinely [[medi\u00e6val]] and how much is Victorian pastiche. Sir Benjamin's statue by [[John Henry Foley|JH Foley]] is outside the south door. His son [[Arthur Guinness, 1st Baron Ardilaun|Arthur]] (also a brewer) came in for humorous but gentle criticism when he donated a stained glass window of '[[Rebecca]] at the well'; its motto read: 'I was thirsty and ye gave me drink'. In 1901 his son [[Edward Cecil Guinness, 1st Earl of Iveagh|Edward]] created the adjacent \"St Patrick's Park\" from an area of decrepit housing, and donated a new set of bells to the cathedral.\n\nThe other great change for the cathedral occurred in 1871 when, following disestablishment of the Church of Ireland, the newly independent church at its general synod finally resolved the \"two cathedral\" issue, making Christ Church the sole and undisputed cathedral of the Dublin diocese and St Patrick's the national cathedral.\n\n==Present==\n[[File:St Patrick's Cathedral Nave 2, Dublin, Ireland - Diliff.jpg|thumb|right|The nave as viewed from the western end]]\n\nThe cathedral plays host to a number of public national ceremonies. Ireland's [[Remembrance Day]] ceremonies, hosted by the [[Royal British Legion]] and attended by the President of Ireland, take place there every November. Its carol service (the Service of Nine Lessons and Carols), celebrated twice in December, including every 24 December, is a colourful feature of Dublin life.\n\nOn Saturdays in autumn the cathedral hosts the graduation ceremonies of [[Technological University Dublin]].\n\nThe funerals of two Irish presidents, [[Douglas Hyde]] and [[Erskine Hamilton Childers|Erskine Childers]], took place there in 1949<ref>[http://www.stpatrickscathedral.ie/Irish-Presidents.aspx The State Pew at St Patrick's Cathedral]</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft2w1004tq&chunk.id=d0e7854&toc.depth=1&toc.id=&brand=ucpress |author1=Dunleavy, Janet Egleson |author2=Gareth W.

At President Hyde's funeral, the whole of the Irish government and opposition contingent, but for Childers and [[Noel Browne]], stayed in the foyer of the church. This was because, at the time of the funeral, the [[Holy See]] forbade Roman Catholics from entering the churches of other Christian traditions.{{clarify|date=May 2016}} Because President Childers died in office, his [[List of Irish state funerals|state funeral]] was a major state occasion. The attendance included foreign dignitaries King [[Baudouin I of Belgium|Baudouin of the Belgians]], the [[Vice-President of the United States]] ([[Spiro T. Agnew]] representing [[Richard Nixon|President Nixon]]), [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Earl Mountbatten of Burma]] (representing [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth]]), [[British Prime Minister]] [[Harold Wilson]] and former British prime minister [[Edward Heath]].\n\nIn 2006, the cathedral's national prominence was used by a group of 18 Afghan migrants seeking asylum, who occupied it for several days before being persuaded to leave without trouble.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Walsh |first1=Anne-Marie |title=Timeline: how tense drama at St Patrick's unfolded |url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/timeline-how-tense-drama-at-st-patricks-unfolded-26385590.html |website=Independent.ie |publisher=Irish Independent |accessdate=1 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\n\n===Dean and chapter===\n[[File:Saint patrick floor.jpg|thumb|250px|Floor of the cathedral]]\nThe cathedral is headed by the [[Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|Dean]] and governed by the entire chapter, originally 13 in number and having been as many as 30, now numbering up to 28, whose foundation and members' rights derive from the charter of 1191 as approved by Pope Celestine in 1192.\n\nAccording to the Constitution of the Church of Ireland, the dean is the \"immediate ordinary of the cathedral for the purpose of directing the clergy and official and ordering the services\". However, \"All other matters relating to the cathedral and not otherwise provided for shall be determined in chapter\".<ref>[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/letters/2011/1028/1224306622399.html \"An ecumenical matter for St Patrick's'', ''The Irish Times'', 28 October 2011.]</ref>\nThe members of the chapter, which today represents in part the whole Church of Ireland, hold one of four ''dignities'' or special offices, or one of 24 prebends (22 regular, 2 ecumenical as noted below). One prebend is reserved for the Archbishop of Dublin, an unusual arrangement which is only actively used for elections of the dean.\n\nOf the 13 original prebends, several were later reallocated, new ones created to replace them, and later, yet further prebends were designated. For many years, the chapter comprised the four dignities, the archdeacons of Dublin and Glendalough and 24 prebendaries, but the archdeacons ceased to be members based on those offices in the late 19th century.\n\n===Cathedral group of parishes (1970 to 2012)===\nAs part of a reorganisation of city-based parishes (many with long histories), several were attached to each of the Dublin cathedrals. The Saint Patrick's Cathedral Group of Parishes which dated as a group from 1970 ceased to exist on the retirement of Dean Robert MacCarthy on 25 January 2012.\n\nA new parish, called the Parish of St Catherine and St James with St Audoen, was created by an act of the General Synod of the Church of Ireland.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://ireland.anglican.org/cmsfiles/pdf/Synod/2010/statutes/statute_ch_ii.pdf|title = Statute, Chapter II of 2010|date = 2010|accessdate = 2015-12-27|website = |publisher = |last = The Church of Ireland|first = General Synod of}}</ref> This new parish is made up of each of the parishes of St Peter, St Matthias and St Audoen; St Catherine and St James; and St Luke and St Kevin.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Our New Parish|url = http://cja.dublin.anglican.org/history/our-new-parish/|website = St Catherine and St James with St Audoen|accessdate = 2015-12-27|language = en-US}}</ref> The rector is the Revd Canon M. D. Gardner, Prebendary of Maynooth.\n\n===Current offices===\n* Dean: from 1220 to 2007, the dean held the prebend of [[Clondalkin]] (a prebend since 1191), and churches at Kilberry, Clonwanwyr (Cloney) and Clonardmacgory (Tullaghgory), all later in the Parish of Kilberry. In 1228, the Church of [[Tallaght]] was attached to the Deanery. The current dean is the Very Revd William Morton, one time Dean of [[St Columb's Cathedral]], Londonderry.\n* Precentor: the precentor was given the prebend of a portion of [[Lusk, County Dublin|Lusk]] in 1191, and in 1218 the churches of St Andrew in Dublin and Ardree. After several changes, a portion of Lusk was left. The current precentor is the Revd Peter Campion.\n* Chancellor: from 1218 to 2007, the chancellor held the prebend of [[Finglas]] (from the 1191 charter) and the churches of St Martin's (Dublin) and Killachegar, though the latter ceased by 1280. By 1280, St Martin's also no longer provided revenue but St Werburgh's replaced it. The current chancellor is the Revd [[Niall Sloane]].\n* Treasurer: this office originally held the church of Clonkene and the prebend of [[St. Audoen's Church, Dublin (Church of Ireland)|St Audoen's]] (Dublin), as well as the rectory of St Mary's near Dublin Castle. Ballymore-Eustace later replaced Clonkene, and part of Lusk, St Audoen's. The current treasurer is H. E. Finlay, Canon of Windsor (Royal Peculiar, UK).\n* [[Taney Parish|Taney]]: this prebend, relating to an ancient rural diocese, originated with the 1191 charter, was given to the Archdeacon of Dublin about 1275 and became independent in 1883 when the office of Archdeacon of Dublin ceased to hold a place in the chapter. The current Prebendary of Taney is the Venerable R. W. Carney, Archdeacon of Killaloe and Clonfert.\n* [[Newcastle, County Dublin]]: this is a prebend since at least 1227 and was held by the Archdeacon of Glendalough from 1467 to 1872, when that archdeacon ceased to be a member of the chapter. The current Prebendary of Newcastle is the Revd I. M. Ellis, Rector of Newcastle (Dromore).\n* Kilmactalway: this was made a prebend circa 1366 and was attached to the office of precentor for a time before becoming independent in 1467. The current Prebendary of Kilmactalway is the Venerable G. L. Hastings, Archdeacon of Tuam.\n* Swords: [[Swords, Dublin|Swords]] has been a prebend since the original charter of 1191. As at September 2011, the Prebendary of Swords is the Very Revd G. J. O. Dunstan, Dean of Armagh.\n* Yagoe: this has been a prebend since 1191, and was for over 600 years in the patronage of senior Irish aristocrats. The Prebendary of Yagoe at September 2011 is the Revd T. S. Forster (Armagh).\n* St Audoen: after over 200 years as an adjunct to the Treasury, this became an independent prebend in 1467.

McDowell, Rector of Ballywillan (Connor).\n* [[Wicklow]]: attached to the Archdiaconate of [[Glendalough]] from the early 14th century to 1467, this has since been independent. Prebendary of Wicklow as at September 2011 is the Revd S. E. Doogan, Incumbent of Ballyholme (Down).\n* Tymothan: a manor estate, rather than a church, was attached to the Archbishopric until 1247, and has since been independent, though until Disestablishment, often vacant. As of September 2014, the Prebendary of Tymothan is Canon Paul Willoughby, Rector of the Kilmocomoge Union of Parishes (Cork).\n* Mulhuddart: [[Mulhuddart]] has a history intertwined with the prebend of [[Castleknock]], the two having been designated from at least 1230. The Revd J.M. Catterall, Mostrim (Ardagh), is Prebendary of Mulhuddart as at September 2011.\n* [[Castleknock]]: with a history intertwined with the prebend of Mulhuddart, this has been designated since at least 1230.

Prebendary of [[Maynooth]] as at September 2011 is the Revd M. D. Gardner, Rector of St Catherine and St James with St Audoen (Dublin).\n* Howth: [[Howth]] was one of the founding prebends, and at any early stage, the Archbishops removed the prebendal church from [[Ireland's Eye]] to Howth village. The Prebendary of Howth as of January 2018 is Revd. Canon David Crooks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stpatrickscathedral.ie/installation-canon-david-crooks-prebendary-howth/|title=Installation of Canon David Crooks as Prebendary of Howth|date=2017-01-13|website=St Patrick's Cathedral|language=en|access-date=2019-02-09}}</ref>\n* [[Rathmichael]]: this has been a prebend since 1227 at latest. At July 2013, Prebendary of [[Rathmichael]] is the Revd C. W. Mullen, dean's vicar .\n* Monmohenock: originally part of the \"Economy Estate\" which supported cathedral operations, this became a lay-appointed prebend but was a regular prebend by circa 1227.

Harvey, Rector of Abbeyleix (Leighlin).\n* Cualaun: after the impedance of the Prebend of Tymothan, and following a gap, from 1317, this prebend without a church provided a seat for the Archbishop of Dublin at the Chapter, used only at the election of a dean. The Prebendary of Cualan as at September 2011 is the Archbishop of Dublin, the Most Revd M. G. St A. Jackson.\n* [[Clondalkin]]: transferred from the dean in 2007, as one of two newly authorised posts of ecumenical canon, this is now held by the Revd Heather Morris, President of the Methodist Church in Ireland\n* [[Finglas]]: transferred from the chancellor in 2007, as one of two newly authorised posts of ecumenical canon, this is now held by the Revd Kiaran O'Mahony OSA.\n\n===Ecumenical canons===\nAs noted above, in late June and early July 2007, Saint Patrick's appointed two ecumenical canons, one Presbyterian and one Roman Catholic, who can be invited by the dean to say Morning or Evening Prayer in the cathedral, read holy scripture and assist at baptisms, marriages, funerals or celebration of Holy Communion as well as participating in the meetings and decisions of the chapter.\n\n==Notable features==\n[[File:Doorreconciliation.jpg|thumb|The Door of Reconciliation, through a hole in which the earls of Kildare and Ormond shook hands in 1492.]]\nThe cathedral, which generally receives no State funding, welcomes all, with a chapel for those who come simply to pray and a small fee for those who wish to sight-see.<ref name=\"opening-times\">{{cite web | url=http://www.stpatrickscathedral.ie/Opening_Times.aspx | title=St Patrick's Cathedral \u2013 Opening Times and Prices | publisher=St Patrick's Cathedral | accessdate=20 January 2015}}</ref> The Cathedral website mentioned in 2006 that visitor numbers had reached around 300,000 a year.\n\nLegend has it that Saint Patrick's was the place where the expression \"[[chancing your arm]]\" (meaning to take a risk) originated, when [[Gerald M\u00f3r FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare]], cut a hole in a door there, still to be seen, and thrust his arm through it to shake hands in friendship, in an effort to call a truce in the [[Butler\u2013FitzGerald dispute]] with James, Earl of Ormond in 1492.\n\nIt was outside St Patrick's that the troops of the Jacob's Garrison assembled after the [[Easter Rising]] to march to [[Richmond Barracks]] where their leader [[Thomas MacDonagh]] and his sub-officers [[John MacBride]] and [[Michael O'Hanrahan]] were condemned to death and moved to [[Kilmainham Gaol]] to be shot.\n\n===Burials===\nOver 500 people are buried on the site, both under the cathedral's floor and in the graveyard outside. \nSome notable individuals include:\n[[File:The Wheatly Tomb, St. Patricks Cathedral, Dublin.jpg|thumb|The Wheatly Tomb, St. Patricks Cathedral, Dublin]]\n*[[Richard Northalis]], [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Catholic Archbishop of Dublin]]\n*[[John de Sandford]], [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Catholic Archbishop of Dublin]]\n* [[Hugh Inge]], [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Catholic Archbishop of Dublin]]\n*[[Marcus Beresford (bishop)|Marcus Beresford]]\n* Sir [[John Blennerhassett (judge)|John Blennerhassett]] and his wife\n*[[Thomas Jones (archbishop)|Thomas Jones]] as well as his wife\n*[[Michael Boyle (the younger)|Michael Boyle]]\n*[[Richard Meredith (bishop)|Richard Meredith]]\n*[[Michael Tregury]], Archbishop of Dublin (1450\u20131471)\n*[[Adam Loftus (archbishop)|Adam Loftus]], also the first [[Provost (education)|Provost]] of [[Trinity College, Dublin]] \u2013 in a family vault also containing his wife and two of their children\n*[[John Cradock]], Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin (1772\u20131778)\n* [[Frederick Schomberg]], 1st Duke of Schomberg (1615/6-1690)\n*[[Jonathan Swift]], author and dean of the cathedral and [[Esther Johnson]] (\"Stella\") his companion of many years.\n*Sir [[Jerome Alexander]] (died 1670), a notoriously severe judge\n*[[Thomas Cromwell, 3rd Earl of Ardglass]]\n*[[Lennox Robinson]], Playwright and Director\n\n===Choir school and grammar school===\n[[File:Yoke.JPG|thumb|right|The current [[organ console]]]]\n\nThe choir school continues and although originally all-male, now also admits girls; a Cathedral Girls' Choir was founded in 2000 and sings once or twice a week. The girls are mostly drawn from either the choir school or St Patrick's Grammar School, which provides a secondary education. It is no longer compulsory for grammar school pupils to be in the choirs, although many of the girls are, and a few boys; many of the boys leave when their voice breaks. Choirboys are considered professional singers and are paid monthly for their services. The girls are not. The choir also sings very occasionally at weddings and receive payment for this. Until 1998 they received a large discount on their education; they are still offered free music lessons. While non-choirboy students had two months' holidays during the summer, half of the boys were on duty every day during the summer and had to attend choir practice and two services each weekday, one service on Saturday and two on Sunday. This arrangement was also changed in 1998.\n\n===Organ===\nThe organ of St Patrick's Cathedral is one of the largest in Ireland with over 4,000 pipes.

Since 1870, the Church of Ireland has designated St Patrick's as the national cathedral for the whole of Ireland, drawing chapter members from each of the twelve [[List of Church of Ireland dioceses|dioceses]] of the Church of Ireland. The [[Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|dean]] is the [[Ordinary (officer)|ordinary]] for the cathedral; this office has existed since 1219. The most famous office holder was [[Jonathan Swift]].\n\n===Status===\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2012}}\n\n[[File:presidentspew.jpg|thumb|250px|State pew of the [[President of Ireland]], still retains a British Standard carving on the front]]\nThere is almost no precedent for a two-cathedral city, and some believe it was intended that St Patrick's, a secular (diocesan clergy who are not members of a religious order, i.e. under a rule and, therefore, \"regular\") cathedral, would replace Christ Church, a cathedral managed by an order.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nA confrontational situation persisted, with considerable tension, over the decades after the establishment of St Patrick's, and was eventually settled, more-or-less, by the signing of a six-point agreement of 1300, ''Pacis Compositio''. Still extant, and in force until 1870, it provided that:\n* The consecration and enthronement of the Archbishop of Dublin was to take place at Christ Church \u2013 records show that this provision was not always followed, with many archbishops enthroned in both, and at least two in Saint Patrick's only\n* Christ Church had formal precedence, as the mother and senior cathedral of the diocese\n* Christ Church was to retain the cross, mitre and ring of each deceased Archbishop of Dublin\n* Deceased Archbishops of Dublin were to be buried alternately in each of the two cathedrals, unless they personally willed otherwise\n* The annual consecration of chrism oil for the diocese was to take place at Christ Church\n* The two cathedrals were to act as one, and shared equally in their freedoms.\n\nOver the following centuries, the two cathedrals functioned together in the diocese, until in the period of disestablishment of the Church of Ireland, the current designation of one as the ''cathedral of Dublin and Glendalough'', and one as the ''National Cathedral'', was developed.\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-Reformation period===\n[[File:St Patrick's Cathedral Choir, Dublin, Ireland - Diliff.jpg |thumb|right|The choir of St Patrick's Cathedral]]\n\nIn 1192, [[John Comyn (archbishop)|John Comyn]], first Anglo-Norman [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Archbishop of Dublin]], elevated one of the four Dublin Celtic parish churches, this one dedicated to [[Saint Patrick]], beside a holy well of the same name and on an island between two branches of the [[River Poddle]], to the status of a collegiate church, i.e., a church with a body of clergy devoted to both worship and learning. The new collegiate church fell outside the City boundaries, and this move created two new civic territories, one under the Archbishop's temporal jurisdiction. The church was dedicated to \"God, our Blessed Lady Mary and St Patrick\" on 17 March 1191.<ref>Bernard, 1924: p. 8</ref>\n\nComyn's charter of 1191 or 1192, which allowed for a chapter of thirteen canons, of which three held special dignities (as Chancellor, Precentor and Treasurer), was confirmed by a [[Papal Bull]] (of [[Pope Celestine III]]) within a year. The thirteen [[prebendaries]] attached to the church were provided with archepiscopal lands.\n\nOver time, a whole complex of buildings arose in the vicinity of the cathedral, including the Palace of the St Sepulchre (seat of the Archbishop), and legal jurisdiction was divided between a Liberty controlled by the Dean, around the cathedral, and a larger one belonging to the Archbishop, adjacent.\n\nWhile it is not clear when precisely the church was further raised to the status of cathedral, a unique move in a city with an existing cathedral, it was probably after 1192, and Comyn's successor as Archbishop, [[Henry de Loundres]], was elected in 1212 by the chapters of both Christ Church and St Patrick's, this election being recognised by [[Pope Innocent III]]. See below for more on the question of status. Henry granted a number of further charters to the Cathedral and Chapter between 1218 and 1220, and one of these in 1220 created the office of Dean to head the Cathedral,<ref>Bernard, 1924: p. 9</ref> the right of election being allocated solely to the canons of the Chapter.\n\nThe basis of the present building, as noted, the largest church in Ireland, was built between 1191 and 1270, though little now remains of the earliest work beyond the Baptistry. Much of the work was overseen by the previously mentioned Henry of London, a friend of the King of England and signatory of the [[Magna Carta]], who was also involved in the construction of Dublin's city walls, and [[Dublin Castle]].\n\nAn order from [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]] in 1225 allowed the collection of donations from across the island for reconstruction for a period of four years, and the work, in the Early English [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style, lasted at least until rededication in 1254. The [[Lady Chapel]] was added around 1270.<ref>Bernard, 1924: pp. 9\u201310</ref>\n\nIn 1300, [[Richard de Ferings|Archbishop Ferings]] of Dublin arranged an agreement between the two cathedrals, the ''Pacis Compositio'', which acknowledged both as cathedrals and made some provision to accommodate their shared status.<ref>Bernard, 1924: pp. 73\u201374</ref> For more, see ''Status'' below.\n\nIn 1311 the [[Medieval University of Dublin]] was founded here with [[William de Rodyard]], Dean of St Patrick's, as its first Chancellor, and the Canons as its members. It never flourished, and was suppressed at the [[Reformation]].\n\nFrom the mid-14th century, and for over 500 years, the north [[transept]] of the building was used as the parish church of [[Church of St Nicholas Without, (Church of Ireland)|St Nicholas Without]] (i.e. the part of the Parish of St Nicholas outside the city proper).\n\nThe tower (Minot's Tower) and west [[nave]] were rebuilt between 1362 and 1370, following a fire. The name commemorates [[Thomas Minot]], [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Archbishop of Dublin]] 1363\u201375, who oversaw the rebuilding.\n\nFrom the very earliest years there were problems with seepage of water, with a number of floods, especially in the later years of the 18th century, caused by the surrounding branches of the River Poddle \u2013 even in the 20th century, it is reported that the water table was within 2.3 metres (7.5&nbsp;feet) of the floor.<ref>Bernard, 1924: p. 10, note 3</ref> This situation ensured there would never be a crypt or basement area.<ref>Bernard, 1924: p. 10</ref>\n\n===Reformation period===\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2012|reason=Only one citation and that appears only to support a single clause of text about the 1555 charter}}\n[[File:St. Patrick's Jones memorial.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Memorial to [[Thomas Jones (Archbishop)|Thomas Jones]], Dean of St Patrick's from 1581 to 1585]]\n\nAfter the [[English Reformation]] (an uneven process between 1536 and 1564 but at St Patrick's, effective from about 1537), St Patrick's became an [[Anglican]] [[Church of Ireland]] church. Most Dubliners followed the same line. In the 1530s some images within the cathedral were defaced by soldiers under [[Thomas Cromwell]],{{clarify|date=October 2016}} and neglect led to collapse of the nave in 1544. The conventionally-flexible style of the Archbishop of Dublin [[Hugh Curwen]] is instructive; he was a follower firstly of Henry's non-Reformed church in the 1530s, then of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI's]] full-blown Protestantism c.1550, then accepting his appointment as archbishop during [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary's]] reversion of the church to [[Roman Catholicism]] in 1555, and continued to serve as the archbishop, using the Anglican rite from 1559, under [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] until 1567.\n\nUnder [[King Edward VI]], St Patrick's Cathedral was formally suppressed, and the building demoted back to the status of parish church. On 25 April 1547, a pension of 200 marks sterling was assigned to \"Sir Edward Basnet\", the Dean, followed, some months later, by pensions of \u00a360 each to Chancellor Alien and Precentor Humphrey, and \u00a340 to Archdeacon Power. The silver, jewels, and ornaments were transferred to the Dean and Chapter of Christ Church. The King designated part of the building for use as a court house, the Cathedral Grammar School was established in the then vicar's hall and the deanery given to the archbishop, following the transfer of the Archbishop's Palace to the Lord Deputy of Ireland. In 1549, it was further ordered that the walls be repainted and inscribed with passages from the scriptures.\n\nIn 1555 a charter of the joint monarchs [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]] and [[Mary I of England|Mary]] restored the cathedral's privileges<ref>Bernard, 1924: p. 13</ref> and initiated restoration and a late document of Queen Mary's reign, a deed dated 27 April 1558, comprises a release or receipt by Thomas Leverous, the new Dean, and the Chapter of St Patrick's, of the \"goods, chattels, musical instruments, etc.\", belonging to the Cathedral, and which had been in the possession of the Dean and Chapter of Christ Church. It was during this reign that the patronal festival of the Blessed Virgin Mary was last celebrated (in 1558).\n\nFollowing the ejection of the Catholic chapter of canons in 1559, the Catholic community continued in the 1560s\u20131570s at least to go on nominating canons and the principal dignitaries to St Patrick's.\n\nIn 1560, one of Dublin's first public clocks was erected in \"St Patrick's Steeple\".\n\n===17th century===\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2012}}\n[[File:St Patrick's Cathedral Lady Chapel, Dublin, Ireland - Diliff.jpg|thumb|Lady Chapel in Saint Patrick's Cathedral today.]]\nBy the early 17th century, the Lady Chapel was said to have been in ruins, and the arch at the east end of the choir was closed off by a lath and plaster partition wall. There was also routine flooding and a series of galleries was added to accommodate large congregations. In 1620 the English-born judge [[Luke Gernon]]  referred to the Cathedral's poor state of repair.<ref>Gernon, Luke  ''A Discourse of Ireland'' 1620 edited by C.S Falkiner 1904</ref>\n\nDuring the stay of [[Oliver Cromwell]] in Dublin, during his [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|conquest of Ireland]] the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]]'s [[Lord Protector]] stabled his horses in the nave of the cathedral. This was intended to demonstrate Cromwell's disrespect for the [[Anglican]] religion, which he associated with [[Roman Catholicism]] and political [[Cavalier|Royalism]].\n\nAfter the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, repairs to the building were begun.\n\nIn 1666, the Cathedral Chapter offered the Lady Chapel for the use of French-speaking [[Huguenots]] who had fled to Ireland, and after some repair and preparation works, it became known as ''L'Eglise Fran\u00e7aise de St Patrick''. A lease was signed on 23 December 1665 and was renewed from time to time until the special services ceased in 1816, by which time the Huguenots had been fully assimilated into the city population.\n\nIn 1668 the roof, in danger of collapsing, was taken down, a new roof being completed by 1671. Buttresses were erected and the west window was replaced with a perpendicular window. Then, in the 1680s, the choir was reformed. In 1688\u201390, during the [[Williamite War in Ireland]], [[James II of England|James II]] and his fellow [[Roman Catholic|Catholics]] briefly repossessed St Patrick's. James attended [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] services there with his [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] supporters for a time.{{clarify|date=July 2017}} However, the victory of the Protestant Williamites in this war meant that the cathedral was restored to Anglican ownership in 1690 when James abandoned Dublin after his defeat at the [[Battle of the Boyne]].\n\n===18th century===\n[[File:St. Patrick's Cathedral Swift bust.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Bust of [[Jonathan Swift]]]]\n[[File:Dublin, St.Patrick's Cathedral plan.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Mid 18th century floor plan]]\nThroughout its long history the cathedral has contributed much to Irish life, and one key aspect of this relates to the writer and satirist [[Jonathan Swift]], author of ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', who was [[Dean (Christianity)|Dean]] of the cathedral from 1713 to 1745. Many of his famous sermons and \"Irish tracts\" (such as the ''[[Drapier's Letters]]'') were given during his stay as Dean.<ref>''History of St Patrick's Cathedral'' by Monck Mason</ref>\n\nHis grave and [[epitaph]] can be seen in the cathedral, along with those of his friend Stella. Swift took a great interest in the building, its services and music and in what would now be called social welfare, funding an almshouse for poor women and Saint Patrick's Hospital.\n\nThe Choir School, which had been founded in 1432, supplied many of its members to take part in the very first performance of [[Handel]]'s [[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]] in 1742.\n\nIn 1749, the cathedral spire was added by [[George Semple]]; it remains one of Dublin's landmarks.\n\nIn 1792, divine service was temporarily suspended due to the poor condition of the south wall, then 60 centimetres (2&nbsp;feet) out of perpendicular, and of parts of the roof.\n\n====Chivalric chapels====\n* Knights of St Patrick. From 1783 until 1871 the cathedral served as the Chapel of the Most Illustrious [[Order of Saint Patrick]], members of which were the Knights of St Patrick. With the dis-establishment of the Church of Ireland in 1871 the installation ceremony moved to [[St. Patrick's Hall (Dublin)|St Patrick's Hall]], [[Dublin Castle]]. The heraldic banners of the knights at the time of the change still hang over the choir stalls to this day.\n* ''Paris-Malta obedience'' of the [[Order of Saint Lazarus (statuted 1910)]]. The Cathedral contains the so-called ''Dunsany''{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Chapel which is the spiritual home of the order in Ireland. The decoration of the chapel was provided for by Randall Plunkett, 19th [[Baron of Dunsany|Lord Dunsany]], who established the order in Ireland in 1962. The cathedral is used for its [[investiture]] ceremonies and the Dean of the Cathedral is an Ecclesiastical [[Commander (order)|Commander]] of the order.\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:St. Patrick's Cathedral stones.jpg|thumb|left|Celtic cross discovered near the church in the 19th century.]]\n[[File:Dublin St. Patrick's Cathedral Statue of Sir Benjamin Lee Guinness 2012 09 26.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Bronze statue of Sir Benjamin Lee Guinness by John Henry Foley, erected in 1875.<ref>{{cite book |last=Casey |first=Christine |title=The Buildings of Ireland: Dublin |isbn=978-0-300-10923-8 |page=606 |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2005}}</ref>]]\nBy 1805, the north transept was in ruins and the south transept was in a poor condition; urgent work was carried out to the nave roof, held up by scaffolding.\n\nIn 1846, the post of Dean of Saint Patrick's was united with that of Dean of Christ Church, a situation which lasted in law until 1872.\n\nAn attempt at major restoration began under the direction of Dean Pakenham (Dean, 1843\u20131864), limited by poor economic circumstances. The Lady Chapel was restored, the floor (then raised several metres) reduced to its original level and other urgent matters were at least partly addressed.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, a Celtic cross was found buried near the cathedral. This has been preserved and it is thought it may have marked the site of the former holy well.\n\nThe major reconstruction, paid for by [[Benjamin Guinness]], in 1860\u201365, and inspired by the fear that the cathedral was in imminent danger of collapse, means that much of the current building and decoration dates from the [[Victorian era]]; medieval [[Chantry|chantries]] were removed among other actions, and few records of the work survive today.\n\nThough the rebuilding ensured the survival of the Cathedral, the failure to preserve records of the scale of the rebuild means that little is known as to how much of the current building is genuinely [[medi\u00e6val]] and how much is Victorian pastiche. Sir Benjamin's statue by [[John Henry Foley|JH Foley]] is outside the south door. His son [[Arthur Guinness, 1st Baron Ardilaun|Arthur]] (also a brewer) came in for humorous but gentle criticism when he donated a stained glass window of '[[Rebecca]] at the well'; its motto read: 'I was thirsty and ye gave me drink'. In 1901 his son [[Edward Cecil Guinness, 1st Earl of Iveagh|Edward]] created the adjacent \"St Patrick's Park\" from an area of decrepit housing, and donated a new set of bells to the cathedral.\n\nThe other great change for the cathedral occurred in 1871 when, following disestablishment of the Church of Ireland, the newly independent church at its general synod finally resolved the \"two cathedral\" issue, making Christ Church the sole and undisputed cathedral of the Dublin diocese and St Patrick's the national cathedral.\n\n==Present==\n[[File:St Patrick's Cathedral Nave 2, Dublin, Ireland - Diliff.jpg|thumb|right|The nave as viewed from the western end]]\n\nThe cathedral plays host to a number of public national ceremonies. Ireland's [[Remembrance Day]] ceremonies, hosted by the [[Royal British Legion]] and attended by the President of Ireland, take place there every November. Its carol service (the Service of Nine Lessons and Carols), celebrated twice in December, including every 24 December, is a colourful feature of Dublin life.\n\nOn Saturdays in autumn the cathedral hosts the graduation ceremonies of [[Technological University Dublin]].\n\nThe funerals of two Irish presidents, [[Douglas Hyde]] and [[Erskine Hamilton Childers|Erskine Childers]], took place there in 1949<ref>[http://www.stpatrickscathedral.ie/Irish-Presidents.aspx The State Pew at St Patrick's Cathedral]</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft2w1004tq&chunk.id=d0e7854&toc.depth=1&toc.id=&brand=ucpress |author1=Dunleavy, Janet Egleson |author2=Gareth W.

At President Hyde's funeral, the whole of the Irish government and opposition contingent, but for Childers and [[Noel Browne]], stayed in the foyer of the church. This was because, at the time of the funeral, the [[Holy See]] forbade Roman Catholics from entering the churches of other Christian traditions.{{clarify|date=May 2016}} Because President Childers died in office, his [[List of Irish state funerals|state funeral]] was a major state occasion. The attendance included foreign dignitaries King [[Baudouin I of Belgium|Baudouin of the Belgians]], the [[Vice-President of the United States]] ([[Spiro T. Agnew]] representing [[Richard Nixon|President Nixon]]), [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Earl Mountbatten of Burma]] (representing [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth]]), [[British Prime Minister]] [[Harold Wilson]] and former British prime minister [[Edward Heath]].\n\nIn 2006, the cathedral's national prominence was used by a group of 18 Afghan migrants seeking asylum, who occupied it for several days before being persuaded to leave without trouble.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Walsh |first1=Anne-Marie |title=Timeline: how tense drama at St Patrick's unfolded |url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/timeline-how-tense-drama-at-st-patricks-unfolded-26385590.html |website=Independent.ie |publisher=Irish Independent |accessdate=1 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\n\n===Dean and chapter===\n[[File:Saint patrick floor.jpg|thumb|250px|Floor of the cathedral]]\nThe cathedral is headed by the [[Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|Dean]] and governed by the entire chapter, originally 13 in number and having been as many as 30, now numbering up to 28, whose foundation and members' rights derive from the charter of 1191 as approved by Pope Celestine in 1192.\n\nAccording to the Constitution of the Church of Ireland, the dean is the \"immediate ordinary of the cathedral for the purpose of directing the clergy and official and ordering the services\". However, \"All other matters relating to the cathedral and not otherwise provided for shall be determined in chapter\".<ref>[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/letters/2011/1028/1224306622399.html \"An ecumenical matter for St Patrick's'', ''The Irish Times'', 28 October 2011.]</ref>\nThe members of the chapter, which today represents in part the whole Church of Ireland, hold one of four ''dignities'' or special offices, or one of 24 prebends (22 regular, 2 ecumenical as noted below). One prebend is reserved for the Archbishop of Dublin, an unusual arrangement which is only actively used for elections of the dean.\n\nOf the 13 original prebends, several were later reallocated, new ones created to replace them, and later, yet further prebends were designated. For many years, the chapter comprised the four dignities, the archdeacons of Dublin and Glendalough and 24 prebendaries, but the archdeacons ceased to be members based on those offices in the late 19th century.\n\n===Cathedral group of parishes (1970 to 2012)===\nAs part of a reorganisation of city-based parishes (many with long histories), several were attached to each of the Dublin cathedrals. The Saint Patrick's Cathedral Group of Parishes which dated as a group from 1970 ceased to exist on the retirement of Dean Robert MacCarthy on 25 January 2012.\n\nA new parish, called the Parish of St Catherine and St James with St Audoen, was created by an act of the General Synod of the Church of Ireland.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://ireland.anglican.org/cmsfiles/pdf/Synod/2010/statutes/statute_ch_ii.pdf|title = Statute, Chapter II of 2010|date = 2010|accessdate = 2015-12-27|website = |publisher = |last = The Church of Ireland|first = General Synod of}}</ref> This new parish is made up of each of the parishes of St Peter, St Matthias and St Audoen; St Catherine and St James; and St Luke and St Kevin.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Our New Parish|url = http://cja.dublin.anglican.org/history/our-new-parish/|website = St Catherine and St James with St Audoen|accessdate = 2015-12-27|language = en-US}}</ref> The rector is the Revd Canon M.

The Prebendary of Howth as of January 2018 is Revd. Canon David Crooks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stpatrickscathedral.ie/installation-canon-david-crooks-prebendary-howth/|title=Installation of Canon David Crooks as Prebendary of Howth|date=2017-01-13|website=St Patrick's Cathedral|language=en|access-date=2019-02-09}}</ref>\n* [[Rathmichael]]: this has been a prebend since 1227 at latest.

Harvey, Rector of Abbeyleix (Leighlin).\n* Cualaun: after the impedance of the Prebend of Tymothan, and following a gap, from 1317, this prebend without a church provided a seat for the Archbishop of Dublin at the Chapter, used only at the election of a dean. The Prebendary of Cualan as at September 2011 is the Archbishop of Dublin, the Most Revd M. G. St A. Jackson.\n* [[Clondalkin]]: transferred from the dean in 2007, as one of two newly authorised posts of ecumenical canon, this is now held by the Revd Heather Morris, President of the Methodist Church in Ireland\n* [[Finglas]]: transferred from the chancellor in 2007, as one of two newly authorised posts of ecumenical canon, this is now held by the Revd Kiaran O'Mahony OSA.\n\n===Ecumenical canons===\nAs noted above, in late June and early July 2007, Saint Patrick's appointed two ecumenical canons, one Presbyterian and one Roman Catholic, who can be invited by the dean to say Morning or Evening Prayer in the cathedral, read holy scripture and assist at baptisms, marriages, funerals or celebration of Holy Communion as well as participating in the meetings and decisions of the chapter.\n\n==Notable features==\n[[File:Doorreconciliation.jpg|thumb|The Door of Reconciliation, through a hole in which the earls of Kildare and Ormond shook hands in 1492.]]\nThe cathedral, which generally receives no State funding, welcomes all, with a chapel for those who come simply to pray and a small fee for those who wish to sight-see.<ref name=\"opening-times\">{{cite web | url=http://www.stpatrickscathedral.ie/Opening_Times.aspx | title=St Patrick's Cathedral \u2013 Opening Times and Prices | publisher=St Patrick's Cathedral | accessdate=20 January 2015}}</ref> The Cathedral website mentioned in 2006 that visitor numbers had reached around 300,000 a year.\n\nLegend has it that Saint Patrick's was the place where the expression \"[[chancing your arm]]\" (meaning to take a risk) originated, when [[Gerald M\u00f3r FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare]], cut a hole in a door there, still to be seen, and thrust his arm through it to shake hands in friendship, in an effort to call a truce in the [[Butler\u2013FitzGerald dispute]] with James, Earl of Ormond in 1492.\n\nIt was outside St Patrick's that the troops of the Jacob's Garrison assembled after the [[Easter Rising]] to march to [[Richmond Barracks]] where their leader [[Thomas MacDonagh]] and his sub-officers [[John MacBride]] and [[Michael O'Hanrahan]] were condemned to death and moved to [[Kilmainham Gaol]] to be shot.\n\n===Burials===\nOver 500 people are buried on the site, both under the cathedral's floor and in the graveyard outside. \nSome notable individuals include:\n[[File:The Wheatly Tomb, St. Patricks Cathedral, Dublin.jpg|thumb|The Wheatly Tomb, St. Patricks Cathedral, Dublin]]\n*[[Richard Northalis]], [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Catholic Archbishop of Dublin]]\n*[[John de Sandford]], [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Catholic Archbishop of Dublin]]\n* [[Hugh Inge]], [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Catholic Archbishop of Dublin]]\n*[[Marcus Beresford (bishop)|Marcus Beresford]]\n* Sir [[John Blennerhassett (judge)|John Blennerhassett]] and his wife\n*[[Thomas Jones (archbishop)|Thomas Jones]] as well as his wife\n*[[Michael Boyle (the younger)|Michael Boyle]]\n*[[Richard Meredith (bishop)|Richard Meredith]]\n*[[Michael Tregury]], Archbishop of Dublin (1450\u20131471)\n*[[Adam Loftus (archbishop)|Adam Loftus]], also the first [[Provost (education)|Provost]] of [[Trinity College, Dublin]] \u2013 in a family vault also containing his wife and two of their children\n*[[John Cradock]], Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin (1772\u20131778)\n* [[Frederick Schomberg]], 1st Duke of Schomberg (1615/6-1690)\n*[[Jonathan Swift]], author and dean of the cathedral and [[Esther Johnson]] (\"Stella\") his companion of many years.\n*Sir [[Jerome Alexander]] (died 1670), a notoriously severe judge\n*[[Thomas Cromwell, 3rd Earl of Ardglass]]\n*[[Lennox Robinson]], Playwright and Director\n\n===Choir school and grammar school===\n[[File:Yoke.JPG|thumb|right|The current [[organ console]]]]\n\nThe choir school continues and although originally all-male, now also admits girls; a Cathedral Girls' Choir was founded in 2000 and sings once or twice a week. The girls are mostly drawn from either the choir school or St Patrick's Grammar School, which provides a secondary education. It is no longer compulsory for grammar school pupils to be in the choirs, although many of the girls are, and a few boys; many of the boys leave when their voice breaks. Choirboys are considered professional singers and are paid monthly for their services. The girls are not. The choir also sings very occasionally at weddings and receive payment for this. Until 1998 they received a large discount on their education; they are still offered free music lessons. While non-choirboy students had two months' holidays during the summer, half of the boys were on duty every day during the summer and had to attend choir practice and two services each weekday, one service on Saturday and two on Sunday. This arrangement was also changed in 1998.\n\n===Organ===\nThe organ of St Patrick's Cathedral is one of the largest in Ireland with over 4,000 pipes. Parts of it date from a [[Renatus Harris]] instrument of 1695.<ref>\"The Cathedrals of the [[Church of Ireland]]\" [[John Godfrey FitzMaurice Day|Day, J.G.F./]] [[Henry Edmund Patton|Patton, H.E.]] p79: [[London]], [[SPCK|S.P.C.K.]], [[1932]]</ref> The organ was rebuilt in the 1890s by Henry Willis and Son, in consultation with Sir George Martin.
