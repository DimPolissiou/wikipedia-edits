Frederick]], collapsed 1892 during construction of the Howard Street Tunnel by the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]].]]\n\nPublic pressure and increasing needs of the trade and commercial classes induced several political leaders to introduce resolutions into the old City Hall calling for the creation of a high school \"in which the higher branches of English and classical literature should be taught exclusively\". The resolution was unanimously passed by the [[Baltimore City Council]] on March 7, 1839, and signed by the tenth [[List of mayors of Baltimore|Mayor]], Shepard C. Leakin.<ref>Steiner (1894), p. 207.</ref>\n\nAccordingly, the Board of School Commissioners rented a townhouse structure 2 blocks northwest of the [[Baltimore City Circuit Courthouses|Baltimore City/County Courthouse]] on a small narrow by-way of what was then called Courtland Street (now on the east side of [[St. Paul Street (Baltimore)|Saint Paul Street/Place]].\n\n\"The High School\", as it was first called, opened its doors on October 20, 1839, with 46 students and one teacher/professor, [[Nathan C. Brooks]] (1809\u20131898), a renowned local Classics literature scholar, who also served as first principal.\n\nThe school moved several times at its beginnings and was housed in three different locations in its first three years before returning again to the original townhouse building on Courtland Street. Finally, in 1843, the City Council allocated $23,000 to acquire the vacant old landmark \"Assembly Rooms\" structure at the northeastern corner of East Fayette and Holliday Streets for the new school. The famous Assembly Rooms was operated by the old Baltimore Dancing Assembly and were the site of social functions for the upcoming middle class who did not yet have fine drawing rooms and mansions for throwing parties. \nIn  1850, the [[Baltimore City Council|City Council]] granted the Board of School Commissioners the right to confer graduates of the decade old high school with certificates of graduation, and the following year in the  old Front Street Theatre, along the [[Jones Falls]] stream (between East Fayette and Lexington Streets)  the high school held its first [[Graduation|commencement]] ceremony under the name of the \"Central High School of Baltimore\" with well-known influential civic citizen and lawyer [[Severn Teackle Wallis]]  (1816-1894), as its first speaker.<ref>Steiner (1894), p. 209.</ref>\n\nIn 1865, in accordance with a recommendation from the Board of Commissioners of the [[Baltimore City Public Schools]], the school began offering a five-year track,<ref name=\"37th Report\">{{cite book | last = Board of Commissioners of Public Schools | title =37th Annual Report of the Board of Commissioners of Public Schools to the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore | publisher = James Young | year = 1866 | location = Baltimore | pages = 105\u2013106 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=BSwTAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA29&dq=%22Central+High+School%22+report+1866#PPA1,M1 | accessdate=August 6, 2007}}</ref> as part of a process aimed at elevating the school to the status of a college so that it could grant its graduates baccalaureate degrees. The following year, on October 9, 1866, the school was renamed \"The Baltimore City College\" (BCC) by the Baltimore City Council. The Council failed to take any further action, and although the school changed nominally, it was never granted the power to confer Bachelor of Arts degrees.<ref>Steiner (1894), p. 218.</ref>\n\nIn 1873, when a fire spread from the [[Holliday Street Theater]] to the \"Assembly Rooms\", the City Council dedicated new resources to erect a new building especially for the City College. A lot was acquired on North Howard Street opposite West Centre Street and the Council allocated $150,000 for the construction of the new building designed by Baltimore architect [[Edmund G. Lind]] and municipal architect [[George A. Frederick|George C. Frederick]], who among his many city projects was completing construction of the massive new domed [[Baltimore City Hall]], then rising in the block across Holliday Street from old burnt City College / Central High and its Assembly Rooms structure.<ref>Steiner (1894), p. 220.</ref> The new English [[Gothic revival]]-styled building faced east on Howard Street and was adjacent to the magnificent Academy of Music (a Victorian decorative styled music hall and auditorium also constructed at the same time to the south - site of presidential inaugural festivities for the newly opened [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1876, also used for the opening of the [[Enoch Pratt Free Library]] in 1882 / 1886). The new Baltimore City College, now finally in a home especially built for its educational mission after 36 years, was dedicated on February 1, 1875. The school moved in the following week.<ref>Steiner (1894), p. 221.</ref>\n\nThe Tudor Gothic building which housed the school after only 17 years of use was undermined in 1892 by the construction of the [[Baltimore & Ohio Railroad]] tunnel running north under Howard Street from [[Camden Station|Camden Street Station]] to the newly constructed [[Mount Royal Station]] and the City College collapsed, damaging several buildings around it j\nincluding several theaters and the Academy of Music.<ref>{{cite journal | title = A ninety-six ton electric locomotive | journal = Scientific American | date =August 10, 1895 | url = http://www.catskillarchive.com/rrextra/stbando.Html | accessdate =July 13, 2007 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070607192655/http://www.catskillarchive.com/rrextra/stbando.Html| archivedate= June 7, 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> After a long municipal political controversy for three years, by 1895, a new larger structure, designed in the [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]] style by the noted local architects [[Baldwin & Pennington]], was erected on the same site, only turned to be facing the Centre Street northern side. This new building quickly became overcrowded and an annex was established on 26th Street. The addition did not help with the increase in school-aged youth beginning to attend City College by [[World War&nbsp;I]] (1914-1918). During the 1920s, alumni began organizing a campaign to provide the school with a more suitable building with campus grounds and, in 1926, ground was broken for a massive [[Collegiate Gothic in North America|Collegiate Gothic]] stone castle designed by the architectural partnership of Buckler and Fenhagen on renamed \"Collegian Hill\" southwest of newly laid out 33rd Street and The Alameda boulevards in the newly developing northeast section of the city. This new structure cost almost $3&nbsp;million and one of the \nmost expensive public school projects at that time in America, and officially opened April 10, 1928.<ref>Leonhart (1939), p. 20.</ref>\n\nThe school began preparing for admitting African American students following the landmark ruling ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' in May 1954, two years after athletic and academic rival [[Baltimore Polytechnic Institute]] admitted its first then called Negro students in 1952 with little controversy. In that following September 1954, {{nowrap|10 African-American students}} enrolled quietly and peacefully at the City College and were welcomed by Principal Chester A. Katzenkamp, faculty and student body, unlike some disturbances and protest demonstrations at a few other city high schools such as [[Southern High School (Baltimore)|Southern]] and [[Patterson High School (Baltimore)|Patterson Park]].<ref>{{Cite book | author = Hlubb, Julius G. | title = An Analysis of Student Enrollment at the Baltimore City College | publisher = Diss.

One year was spent at the Calvert Educational Center on North Avenue and North Calvert Street during 1978-1979. The second academic year saw the school housed on the basement level of neighboring all-female [[Eastern High School (Baltimore, Maryland)|Eastern High School]].  When the B.C.C. campus reopened, the school welcomed women for the first time. The 140 years all-male tradition did not end easily; alumni and some faculty had argued for the uniqueness of a single-sex educational system. However, the Baltimore Board of School Commissioners ultimately voted to admit women citing [[U.S. Constitution|constitutional]] concerns.<ref>Daneker (1988), p. 58.</ref>\n\n== Campus ==\n[[File:BaltimoreCityCollege-winter.jpg|right|thumb|\"The Castle on the Hill\", Baltimore City College, winter 2009-10]]\nBaltimore City College stands on an expansive, tree-shaded 38-acre (153,781&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>) hill-top campus in northeast Baltimore at the intersection of 33rd Street and the Alameda.<ref name=\"Leonhart 1939, p. 120\"/> The campus consists of two&nbsp;buildings: the Gothic-style edifice known locally as the \"Castle on the Hill\" which sits in the center of the campus, and the power plant building east of the castle.

Brooks]], who also served as [[Principal (school)|principal]].<ref name=\"Steiner207\"/> To accommodate the two tracks, Brooks split the school day into two sections: one in the morning from 9&nbsp;am to 12&nbsp;am, and another in the afternoon from 2&nbsp;pm to 5&nbsp;pm. During the morning session, students studied either classics or English; however, the afternoon was devoted to English.<ref name=\"Steiner207\"/> In 1849, after a decade of service, Prof. [[Nathan C. Brooks|Brooks]] resigned as principal of the school, which had now grown to include 232 students and 7 teachers, excluding Brooks.\n\nRev. Dr. [[Francis G. Waters]], who had been the president of the [[Washington College]], succeeded Brooks. The following year the city council renamed the school \"The Central High School of Baltimore\" and granted the commissioners of the public schools the right to confer certificates to the high school's graduates, a practice still in place today.<ref name=\"Steiner_209\"/> By 1850, growing enrollment necessitated a reorganization of the school. Under the direction of Waters, the school day was divided into eight periods lasting forty-five minutes: four sessions were held in the morning and four in the afternoon. In addition to reorganizing the schedule, he divided the courses into seven different departments: [[Belles-Lettres|Belles-letters]] and history, [[mathematics]], [[natural sciences]], [[moral philosophy|moral]], [[mental philosophy|mental]], and [[political science]], [[Classical antiquity|ancient languages]], [[modern language]]s and music. Each of the seven instructors was assigned to a distinct department and received the title of \"professor\".<ref name=\"Steiner210-211\">Steiner (1894), pp. 210\u2013211.</ref>\n\nIn 1850, the [[Baltimore City Council]] granted the school the authority to present its graduates with certificates of completion.<ref name=\"Steiner_209\">Steiner (1894), p. 209</ref> An effort to expand that academic power and allow the then-named \"Central High School of Baltimore\" to confer Bachelor of Arts degrees began in 1865, and continued the following year with the renaming of the institution as \"The Baltimore City College\" the retitling of its chief academic officer from \"[[principal (academia)|principal]]\" to \"[[college president|president]]\", along with an increase in the number of years of its course of study and the expansion of its courses. However, despite this early elevation effort, it ended unsuccessfully in 1869, although Baltimore City College continued for a number of years as a hybrid public high school and early form of [[junior college]] (later known as [[community college]]) which did not fully appear in America until the beginning of the 20th century. As the importance of college education increased toward the end of the 19th century, the school's priorities shifted to preparing students for college.<ref name=\"BCPSS1902p79\">Board of Commissioners of Public Schools (1902), p. 79.</ref>\n\n===20th-century curriculum: the A/B course era===\n\nIn 1901, the course of study at Baltimore City College went through a series of further changes.

As a result, the [[City of Baltimore]] announced its plan to advance funds to complete a $9 million renovation of the school's main building and earmarked funding for a comprehensive, two-year study (1977\u201379).<ref name=\"Leonhart_139\">Leonhart (1939), p. 139.</ref> Subject matter experts in education and pedagogy, school faculty, parents, alumni, and other members of the school community formed the \"New City College Task Force\".

The speech and debate teams are formally referred to as the [[Bancroft Literary Association and Carrollton-Wight Literary Society|Bancroft and Carrollton-Wight Literary Societies]]. The school's first formal debate team within a literary society was established in 1876 as the Bancroft Literary Association.<ref name=\"Leonhart_233\">Leonhart (1939), p. 233.</ref> In 1878, a second competing society, the Carrollton Literary Society, was formed, named for Maryland's famous longest-living signer of the [[Declaration of Independence]], the only [[Roman Catholic]] member, [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton]] (1737\u20131832).<ref name=\"Leonhart_233\"/> That society was later renamed the \"Carrollton-Wight Literary Society\", in honor of the program's first advisor, Charles Wight, a celebrated faculty member during the 1870s.\n\nToday, the speech and debate team competes in various speech events, Student Congress, Mock Trial, Lincoln-Douglas debate, and Policy Debate against teams throughout [[Maryland]] and routinely travels around the United States to compete on the national circuit.

At the time, the instrumental music program consisted of the orchestra, [[concert band]] and [[marching band]]. The director who brought the band to prominence was Dr. Donald Norton. In 1954, while on sabbatical, he was replaced by Professor Charles M. Stengstacke. The 65 member concert band doubled as a marching band in the fall. During halftime performances at home the band would form the shape of a heart or a car, but always ending the performance by forming the letters C-I-T-Y.<ref>Sirota (1954), p. 63.</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, under James Russell Perkins, these groups grew in size and changed styles, adding \"soulful\" dance steps. Perkins's groups toured and traveled the east coast. They received superior ratings at district and state festivals. Perkins is responsible for the creation of the City College Jazz Band, the \"Knights of Jazz\". In 1994, Alvin T. Wallace became Band Director. During his tenure, a wind ensemble was added and the marching band grew to include over 150&nbsp;members. In 1999, the band swept the top categories in the [[Disney World]] high school band competition.<ref name=\"2000 report\">{{cite web | title = The Baltimore City Public School System 2000 Annual Report | publisher =Baltimore City Public School System| year = 2000 | format=PDF | url = http://www.bcps.k12.md.us/About/PDF/2000_AR_p1.pdf | accessdate =July 16, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061009162641/http://www.bcps.k12.md.us/About/PDF/2000_AR_p1.pdf |archivedate = October 9, 2006}}</ref> In 2006, the wind ensemble received a grade of superior at the district adjudication festival and marched in the Baltimore Mayor's Christmas Day Parade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayorschristmasparade.com/baltimore/christmas_parade_floats.html |title=The Mayor's Annual Christmas Day Parade |accessdate=August 11, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807212148/http://www.mayorschristmasparade.com/baltimore/christmas_parade_floats.html |archivedate=August 7, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Choirs ===\n[[File:Choir, Baltimore City College (2007).jpg|thumb|left|yupright|The choir performing the \"[[Battle Hymn of the Republic]]\" at the school's 2006 Hall of Fame Assembly]]\nThe Baltimore City College [[choir]] was founded in 1950 by Professor Donald Regier.

Published continuously since 1896, it is the oldest publication still in existence at the school and is one of the oldest high school or college yearbooks in America.<ref>Leonhart (1939), p. 237.</ref> G. Warfield Hobbs Jr. (later an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] priest), president of the 1896 senior class and first editor-in-chief of ''The Green Bag'', gave the publication its name in recognition of the role of City College graduates in political leadership. Historically, the famous green \"[[carpet bag]]\" in the 19th century containing the lists of political appointees (also known as \"[[patronage]]\") of the [[Governor of Maryland]] to be approved by the [[Maryland General Assembly|General Assembly of Maryland]] has long been known as the \"green bag\", though the derivation of the term is unknown. The term became synonymous with \"good news\" and \"glad tidings\", such as could be applied to the feelings that recent graduates felt when seeing and reading their new yearbooks published soon after their graduations.<ref>{{cite web | title= The History of Maryland's Green Bag | publisher=Maryland State Archives | year=2003 | url=http://speccol.mdarchives.state.md.us/msa/speccol/catalog/topics/html/green_bag.html |accessdate=August 1, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070624132741/http://speccol.mdarchives.state.md.us/msa/speccol/catalog/topics/html/green_bag.html| archivedate= June 24, 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nThe first yearbooks contained sketches of faculty and seniors, and included recollections, anecdotes, stories, and quotes significant to the student body. Underclassmen were included for the first time with individual portraits in the growing student body in 1948. In 2007, ''The Green Bag'' released its first full-color edition, one of the most colorful since color printing of photographs was first introduced in ''The Bag'' in 1963 and again in 1967. For many years the annual was printed by the local well-known printer/publisher of H.G. Roebuck and Son, owned by a City alumnus up to 1970<ref>{{cite book | last = Baltimore City College | title = The 2007 Green Bag v. 111 | year = 2006 | page = 3}}</ref> The most controversial issue of ''The Green Bag'' was published in 1900 when members of the senior class used the annual to make fun of their professors. The Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners attempted to censor the edition by requiring ''The Green Bag'' to be reviewed by Principal Francis A. Soper. The yearbook had already been printed, and in defiance of the school board, the editors refused to have the edition censored and reprinted. The School Board responded by withholding the diplomas of six of the editors and the business manager and by preventing the school from holding a public commencement ceremony. One of the boys expelled, Clarence Keating Bowie, became a member of the School Board himself in 1926. The infamous cartoon was later printed for the first time in a ''\"Bag\"'' in an opening segment on school history in 1972.<ref>Leonhart (1939), p. 77.</ref>\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:The Collegian (Baltimore City College newspaper - front page, vol. 77 no. 1).jpg|thumb|left|''The Collegian'', Vol. 77.1]] -->\n\n=== ''The Collegian'' ===\n''The Collegian'' has been the school student newspaper of record at Baltimore City College since it was first published as a bi-weekly newspaper in 1929.<ref name=\"leonhart126\">Leonhart (1939), p. 126.</ref> There have been other similar publications, such as ''The Oriole'', the student magazine which started printing in 1912, however ''The Collegian'' is oldest, continuous student-run publication.

The resolution was unanimously passed by the [[Baltimore City Council]] on March 7, 1839, and signed by the tenth [[List of mayors of Baltimore|Mayor]], Shepard C. Leakin.<ref>Steiner (1894), p. 207.</ref>\n\nAccordingly, the Board of School Commissioners rented a townhouse structure 2 blocks northwest of the [[Baltimore City Circuit Courthouses|Baltimore City/County Courthouse]] on a small narrow by-way of what was then called Courtland Street (now on the east side of [[St. Paul Street (Baltimore)|Saint Paul Street/Place]].\n\n\"The High School\", as it was first called, opened its doors on October 20, 1839, with 46 students and one teacher/professor, [[Nathan C. Brooks]] (1809\u20131898), a renowned local Classics literature scholar, who also served as first principal.\n\nThe school moved several times at its beginnings and was housed in three different locations in its first three years before returning again to the original townhouse building on Courtland Street. Finally, in 1843, the City Council allocated $23,000 to acquire the vacant old landmark \"Assembly Rooms\" structure at the northeastern corner of East Fayette and Holliday Streets for the new school. The famous Assembly Rooms was operated by the old Baltimore Dancing Assembly and were the site of social functions for the upcoming middle class who did not yet have fine drawing rooms and mansions for throwing parties. \nIn  1850, the [[Baltimore City Council|City Council]] granted the Board of School Commissioners the right to confer graduates of the decade old high school with certificates of graduation, and the following year in the  old Front Street Theatre, along the [[Jones Falls]] stream (between East Fayette and Lexington Streets)  the high school held its first [[Graduation|commencement]] ceremony under the name of the \"Central High School of Baltimore\" with well-known influential civic citizen and lawyer [[Severn Teackle Wallis]]  (1816-1894), as its first speaker.<ref>Steiner (1894), p. 209.</ref>\n\nIn 1865, in accordance with a recommendation from the Board of Commissioners of the [[Baltimore City Public Schools]], the school began offering a five-year track,<ref name=\"37th Report\">{{cite book | last = Board of Commissioners of Public Schools | title =37th Annual Report of the Board of Commissioners of Public Schools to the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore | publisher = James Young | year = 1866 | location = Baltimore | pages = 105\u2013106 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=BSwTAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA29&dq=%22Central+High+School%22+report+1866#PPA1,M1 | accessdate=August 6, 2007}}</ref> as part of a process aimed at elevating the school to the status of a college so that it could grant its graduates baccalaureate degrees. The following year, on October 9, 1866, the school was renamed \"The Baltimore City College\" (BCC) by the Baltimore City Council. The Council failed to take any further action, and although the school changed nominally, it was never granted the power to confer Bachelor of Arts degrees.<ref>Steiner (1894), p. 218.</ref>\n\nIn 1873, when a fire spread from the [[Holliday Street Theater]] to the \"Assembly Rooms\", the City Council dedicated new resources to erect a new building especially for the City College. A lot was acquired on North Howard Street opposite West Centre Street and the Council allocated $150,000 for the construction of the new building designed by Baltimore architect [[Edmund G. Lind]] and municipal architect [[George A. Frederick|George C.

The school moved in the following week.<ref>Steiner (1894), p. 221.</ref>\n\nThe Tudor Gothic building which housed the school after only 17 years of use was undermined in 1892 by the construction of the [[Baltimore & Ohio Railroad]] tunnel running north under Howard Street from [[Camden Station|Camden Street Station]] to the newly constructed [[Mount Royal Station]] and the City College collapsed, damaging several buildings around it j\nincluding several theaters and the Academy of Music.<ref>{{cite journal | title = A ninety-six ton electric locomotive | journal = Scientific American | date =August 10, 1895 | url = http://www.catskillarchive.com/rrextra/stbando.Html | accessdate =July 13, 2007 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070607192655/http://www.catskillarchive.com/rrextra/stbando.Html| archivedate= June 7, 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> After a long municipal political controversy for three years, by 1895, a new larger structure, designed in the [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]] style by the noted local architects [[Baldwin & Pennington]], was erected on the same site, only turned to be facing the Centre Street northern side. This new building quickly became overcrowded and an annex was established on 26th Street. The addition did not help with the increase in school-aged youth beginning to attend City College by [[World War&nbsp;I]] (1914-1918). During the 1920s, alumni began organizing a campaign to provide the school with a more suitable building with campus grounds and, in 1926, ground was broken for a massive [[Collegiate Gothic in North America|Collegiate Gothic]] stone castle designed by the architectural partnership of Buckler and Fenhagen on renamed \"Collegian Hill\" southwest of newly laid out 33rd Street and The Alameda boulevards in the newly developing northeast section of the city.

In that following September 1954, {{nowrap|10 African-American students}} enrolled quietly and peacefully at the City College and were welcomed by Principal Chester A. Katzenkamp, faculty and student body, unlike some disturbances and protest demonstrations at a few other city high schools such as [[Southern High School (Baltimore)|Southern]] and [[Patterson High School (Baltimore)|Patterson Park]].<ref>{{Cite book | author = Hlubb, Julius G. | title = An Analysis of Student Enrollment at the Baltimore City College | publisher = Diss.

One year was spent at the Calvert Educational Center on North Avenue and North Calvert Street during 1978-1979. The second academic year saw the school housed on the basement level of neighboring all-female [[Eastern High School (Baltimore, Maryland)|Eastern High School]].  When the B.C.C. campus reopened, the school welcomed women for the first time. The 140 years all-male tradition did not end easily; alumni and some faculty had argued for the uniqueness of a single-sex educational system. However, the Baltimore Board of School Commissioners ultimately voted to admit women citing [[U.S. Constitution|constitutional]] concerns.<ref>Daneker (1988), p. 58.</ref>\n\n== Campus ==\n[[File:BaltimoreCityCollege-winter.jpg|right|thumb|\"The Castle on the Hill\", Baltimore City College, winter 2009-10]]\nBaltimore City College stands on an expansive, tree-shaded 38-acre (153,781&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>) hill-top campus in northeast Baltimore at the intersection of 33rd Street and the Alameda.<ref name=\"Leonhart 1939, p. 120\"/> The campus consists of two&nbsp;buildings: the Gothic-style edifice known locally as the \"Castle on the Hill\" which sits in the center of the campus, and the power plant building east of the castle.

During the morning session, students studied either classics or English; however, the afternoon was devoted to English.<ref name=\"Steiner207\"/> In 1849, after a decade of service, Prof. [[Nathan C.

Under the direction of Waters, the school day was divided into eight periods lasting forty-five minutes: four sessions were held in the morning and four in the afternoon. In addition to reorganizing the schedule, he divided the courses into seven different departments: [[Belles-Lettres|Belles-letters]] and history, [[mathematics]], [[natural sciences]], [[moral philosophy|moral]], [[mental philosophy|mental]], and [[political science]], [[Classical antiquity|ancient languages]], [[modern language]]s and music.

At the time, the instrumental music program consisted of the orchestra, [[concert band]] and [[marching band]]. The director who brought the band to prominence was Dr. Donald Norton. In 1954, while on sabbatical, he was replaced by Professor Charles M. Stengstacke. The 65 member concert band doubled as a marching band in the fall. During halftime performances at home the band would form the shape of a heart or a car, but always ending the performance by forming the letters C-I-T-Y.<ref>Sirota (1954), p. 63.</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, under James Russell Perkins, these groups grew in size and changed styles, adding \"soulful\" dance steps. Perkins's groups toured and traveled the east coast. They received superior ratings at district and state festivals. Perkins is responsible for the creation of the City College Jazz Band, the \"Knights of Jazz\". In 1994, Alvin T. Wallace became Band Director. During his tenure, a wind ensemble was added and the marching band grew to include over 150&nbsp;members. In 1999, the band swept the top categories in the [[Disney World]] high school band competition.<ref name=\"2000 report\">{{cite web | title = The Baltimore City Public School System 2000 Annual Report | publisher =Baltimore City Public School System| year = 2000 | format=PDF | url = http://www.bcps.k12.md.us/About/PDF/2000_AR_p1.pdf | accessdate =July 16, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061009162641/http://www.bcps.k12.md.us/About/PDF/2000_AR_p1.pdf |archivedate = October 9, 2006}}</ref> In 2006, the wind ensemble received a grade of superior at the district adjudication festival and marched in the Baltimore Mayor's Christmas Day Parade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayorschristmasparade.com/baltimore/christmas_parade_floats.html |title=The Mayor's Annual Christmas Day Parade |accessdate=August 11, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807212148/http://www.mayorschristmasparade.com/baltimore/christmas_parade_floats.html |archivedate=August 7, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Choirs ===\n[[File:Choir, Baltimore City College (2007).jpg|thumb|left|yupright|The choir performing the \"[[Battle Hymn of the Republic]]\" at the school's 2006 Hall of Fame Assembly]]\nThe Baltimore City College [[choir]] was founded in 1950 by Professor Donald Regier.

Published continuously since 1896, it is the oldest publication still in existence at the school and is one of the oldest high school or college yearbooks in America.<ref>Leonhart (1939), p. 237.</ref> G. Warfield Hobbs Jr. (later an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] priest), president of the 1896 senior class and first editor-in-chief of ''The Green Bag'', gave the publication its name in recognition of the role of City College graduates in political leadership. Historically, the famous green \"[[carpet bag]]\" in the 19th century containing the lists of political appointees (also known as \"[[patronage]]\") of the [[Governor of Maryland]] to be approved by the [[Maryland General Assembly|General Assembly of Maryland]] has long been known as the \"green bag\", though the derivation of the term is unknown. The term became synonymous with \"good news\" and \"glad tidings\", such as could be applied to the feelings that recent graduates felt when seeing and reading their new yearbooks published soon after their graduations.<ref>{{cite web | title= The History of Maryland's Green Bag | publisher=Maryland State Archives | year=2003 | url=http://speccol.mdarchives.state.md.us/msa/speccol/catalog/topics/html/green_bag.html |accessdate=August 1, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070624132741/http://speccol.mdarchives.state.md.us/msa/speccol/catalog/topics/html/green_bag.html| archivedate= June 24, 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nThe first yearbooks contained sketches of faculty and seniors, and included recollections, anecdotes, stories, and quotes significant to the student body. Underclassmen were included for the first time with individual portraits in the growing student body in 1948. In 2007, ''The Green Bag'' released its first full-color edition, one of the most colorful since color printing of photographs was first introduced in ''The Bag'' in 1963 and again in 1967. For many years the annual was printed by the local well-known printer/publisher of H.G. Roebuck and Son, owned by a City alumnus up to 1970<ref>{{cite book | last = Baltimore City College | title = The 2007 Green Bag v. 111 | year = 2006 | page = 3}}</ref> The most controversial issue of ''The Green Bag'' was published in 1900 when members of the senior class used the annual to make fun of their professors. The Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners attempted to censor the edition by requiring ''The Green Bag'' to be reviewed by Principal Francis A. Soper. The yearbook had already been printed, and in defiance of the school board, the editors refused to have the edition censored and reprinted. The School Board responded by withholding the diplomas of six of the editors and the business manager and by preventing the school from holding a public commencement ceremony. One of the boys expelled, Clarence Keating Bowie, became a member of the School Board himself in 1926. The infamous cartoon was later printed for the first time in a ''\"Bag\"'' in an opening segment on school history in 1972.<ref>Leonhart (1939), p. 77.</ref>\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:The Collegian (Baltimore City College newspaper - front page, vol. 77 no. 1).jpg|thumb|left|''The Collegian'', Vol. 77.1]] -->\n\n=== ''The Collegian'' ===\n''The Collegian'' has been the school student newspaper of record at Baltimore City College since it was first published as a bi-weekly newspaper in 1929.<ref name=\"leonhart126\">Leonhart (1939), p. 126.</ref> There have been other similar publications, such as ''The Oriole'', the student magazine which started printing in 1912, however ''The Collegian'' is oldest, continuous student-run publication.

The screenplay is by [[Gilbert Adair]], based on his own novel ''[[The Holy Innocents (Adair novel)|The Holy Innocents]]''. An [[international co-production]] by companies from France, the United Kingdom, and Italy, the film tells the story of an American university student in Paris who, after meeting a peculiar brother and sister who are fellow film enthusiasts, becomes entangled in an [[Love triangle|erotic triangle]]. It is set against the backdrop of the [[May 1968 in France|1968 Paris student riots]]. The film makes several references to various movies of [[classical Hollywood|classical]] and [[French New Wave|New Wave]] cinema, incorporating clips from films that are often imitated by the actors in particular scenes.\n\nThere are two versions: an uncut [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#MPAA film ratings|NC-17]]-rated version, and an R-rated version that is about three minutes shorter.\n\n==Plot==\nMatthew is an American [[Student exchange program|exchange student]] who has come to [[Paris]] to study French. While at the [[Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise]] protesting the firing of [[Henri Langlois]], he meets the free-spirited twins Th\u00e9o and Isabelle. The three bond over a shared love of film.\n\nAfter dinner with their parents, Th\u00e9o and Isabelle offer Matthew the chance to stay with them while their parents are on a trip. Matthew accepts, considering them his first French friends.\n\nMatthew becomes suspicious of their relationship after seeing them sleeping nude together; he soon discovers that they accept nudity and sexuality liberally. After Th\u00e9o loses at a trivia game, Isabelle sentences him to masturbate to a [[Marlene Dietrich]] poster in front of them. After Matthew loses at another game, he is seduced to take Isabelle's virginity. The two then become lovers.\n\nMatthew begins to accept Th\u00e9o and Isabelle's sexuality and his time living with them soon becomes idyllic. The three re-enact a [[Bande \u00e0 part (film)#Famous scenes|famous scene from ''Bande \u00e0 part'']] by \"breaking the world record for running through the Louvre\", and Matthew and Th\u00e9o engage in playful arguments about [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Buster Keaton]], [[Eric Clapton]] and [[Jimi Hendrix]], as well as the subject of [[Maoism]], which Th\u00e9o fervently believes in. \n\nDuring this time Matthew begins to pursue a relationship with Isabelle, separate from Th\u00e9o. Matthew and Isabelle leave the house and go on a regular date, which she has not experienced before. Th\u00e9o retaliates by inviting a companion up to his room, upsetting Isabelle. She distances herself from both Th\u00e9o and Matthew, only to find them next to each other on Th\u00e9o's bed when an argument between the two turns erotic. She then surprises them with a makeshift fort and they fall asleep in each other's arms.\n\nOne morning Th\u00e9o and Isabelle's parents arrive home and find the trio naked in bed together. They are startled by what they find, but leave them be, departing after leaving a cheque. After they leave, Isabelle wakes up and discovers the cheque, realising that their parents have found them. Wordlessly, she attaches a hose to the gas outlet and lies back down with Th\u00e9o and Matthew, attempting to commit suicide. After a few moments, however, they are woken by a brick being hurled through the window; they discover [[May 1968 events in France|hundreds of students rioting in the streets]]. \n\nAll three of them are overjoyed and proceed to join the protesters. Later on, Th\u00e9o joins a small team of protesters preparing molotov cocktails. Matthew tries to stop Th\u00e9o by kissing him, arguing against violence, but he is shunned by both Th\u00e9o and Isabelle.\n\nAs Matthew walks away through the chaos, Th\u00e9o takes Isabelle's hand and hurls a [[molotov cocktail]] at a line of police. The police charge the crowd.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Please do not add any more cast names, this is the full cast list from IMDb -->\n{{div col}}\n* [[Michael Pitt]] as Matthew\n* [[Eva Green]] as Isabelle\n* [[Louis Garrel]] as Th\u00e9o\n* [[Anna Chancellor]] as Mother\n* [[Robin Renucci]] as Father\n* [[Jean-Pierre Kalfon]] as Himself\n* [[Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud]] as Himself\n* Florian Cadiou as Patrick\n* Pierre Hancisse as First buff\n* Valentin Merlet as Second buff\n* Lola Peploe as The Usherette\n* Ingy Fillion as Th\u00e9o's girlfriend\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe first draft of the screenplay was a more straight-forward adaptation by [[Gilbert Adair]] of his own novel, ''[[The Holy Innocents (Adair novel)|The Holy Innocents]]''.

The screenplay is by [[Gilbert Adair]], based on his own novel ''[[The Holy Innocents (Adair novel)|The Holy Innocents]]''. An [[international co-production]] by companies from France, the United Kingdom, and Italy, the film tells the story of an American university student in Paris who, after meeting a peculiar brother and sister who are fellow film enthusiasts, becomes entangled in an [[Love triangle|erotic triangle]]. It is set against the backdrop of the [[May 1968 in France|1968 Paris student riots]]. The film makes several references to various movies of [[classical Hollywood|classical]] and [[French New Wave|New Wave]] cinema, incorporating clips from films that are often imitated by the actors in particular scenes.\n\nThere are two versions: an uncut [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#MPAA film ratings|NC-17]]-rated version, and an R-rated version that is about three minutes shorter.\n\n==Plot==\nMatthew is an American [[Student exchange program|exchange student]] who has come to [[Paris]] to study French. While at the [[Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise]] protesting the firing of [[Henri Langlois]], he meets the free-spirited twins Th\u00e9o and Isabelle. The three bond over a shared love of film.\n\nAfter dinner with their parents, Th\u00e9o and Isabelle offer Matthew the chance to stay with them while their parents are on a trip. Matthew accepts, considering them his first French friends.\n\nMatthew becomes suspicious of their relationship after seeing them sleeping nude together; he soon discovers that they accept nudity and sexuality liberally. After Th\u00e9o loses at a trivia game, Isabelle sentences him to masturbate to a [[Marlene Dietrich]] poster in front of them. After Matthew loses at another game, he is seduced to take Isabelle's virginity. The two then become lovers.\n\nMatthew begins to accept Th\u00e9o and Isabelle's sexuality and his time living with them soon becomes idyllic. The three re-enact a [[Bande \u00e0 part (film)#Famous scenes|famous scene from ''Bande \u00e0 part'']] by \"breaking the world record for running through the Louvre\", and Matthew and Th\u00e9o engage in playful arguments about [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Buster Keaton]], [[Eric Clapton]] and [[Jimi Hendrix]], as well as the subject of [[Maoism]], which Th\u00e9o fervently believes in. \n\nDuring this time Matthew begins to pursue a relationship with Isabelle, separate from Th\u00e9o. Matthew and Isabelle leave the house and go on a regular date, which she has not experienced before. Th\u00e9o retaliates by inviting a companion up to his room, upsetting Isabelle. She distances herself from both Th\u00e9o and Matthew, only to find them next to each other on Th\u00e9o's bed when an argument between the two turns erotic. She then surprises them with a makeshift fort and they fall asleep in each other's arms.\n\nOne morning Th\u00e9o and Isabelle's parents arrive home and find the trio naked in bed together. They are startled by what they find, but leave them be, departing after leaving a cheque. After they leave, Isabelle wakes up and discovers the cheque, realising that their parents have found them. Wordlessly, she attaches a hose to the gas outlet and lies back down with Th\u00e9o and Matthew, attempting to commit suicide. After a few moments, however, they are woken by a brick being hurled through the window; they discover [[May 1968 events in France|hundreds of students rioting in the streets]]. \n\nAll three of them are overjoyed and proceed to join the protesters. Later on, Th\u00e9o joins a small team of protesters preparing molotov cocktails. Matthew tries to stop Th\u00e9o by kissing him, arguing against violence, but he is shunned by both Th\u00e9o and Isabelle.\n\nAs Matthew walks away through the chaos, Th\u00e9o takes Isabelle's hand and hurls a [[molotov cocktail]] at a line of police. The police charge the crowd.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Please do not add any more cast names, this is the full cast list from IMDb -->\n{{div col}}\n* [[Michael Pitt]] as Matthew\n* [[Eva Green]] as Isabelle\n* [[Louis Garrel]] as Th\u00e9o\n* [[Anna Chancellor]] as Mother\n* [[Robin Renucci]] as Father\n* [[Jean-Pierre Kalfon]] as Himself\n* [[Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud]] as Himself\n* Florian Cadiou as Patrick\n* Pierre Hancisse as First buff\n* Valentin Merlet as Second buff\n* Lola Peploe as The Usherette\n* Ingy Fillion as Th\u00e9o's girlfriend\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe first draft of the screenplay was an adaptation by [[Gilbert Adair]] of his own novel, ''[[The Holy Innocents (Adair novel)|The Holy Innocents]]''. During [[pre-production]], Bertolucci made changes to it: he \"peppered the narrative with clips from the films he loves\" and dropped homosexual content \u2013 including scenes from the novel that depict Matthew and Th\u00e9o having sex \u2013 which he felt was \"just too much.\" After the film was released, he said that it was \"faithful to the spirit of the book but not the letter.\"<ref name=\"guard\">[http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,6737,1141677,00.html Stealing beauty], a February 2004 article from ''[[The Guardian]]''</ref>\n\n[[Eva Green]] told ''[[The Guardian]]'' that her agent and her parents begged her not to take the role of Isabelle, concerned that the film \u2013 which features full [[frontal nudity]] and graphic sex scenes \u2013 would cause her career to \"have the same destiny as [[Maria Schneider (actress)|Maria Schneider]].\"<ref name=\"guard\"/>\n\nWhen Green saw a [[rough cut]] of the film, she said she was \"quite shocked\" and had to look away during the sex scenes; she later told an interviewer that for her, \"it was as though I was wearing a costume while we were making the film. It was as if I had another story in my mind. So I was left speechless.\"<ref name=\"guard\" />\n\n===Rating===\n[[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] gave the uncut version a [[Limited release|limited theatrical release]] in the United States in 2004; it played in 116 theaters at its peak.<ref name=\"lat\"/> In the United States, the film was released theatrically with an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#MPAA film ratings|NC-17]] rating<ref name=\"lat\">[http://articles.latimes.com/2004/apr/20/entertainment/et-dutka20 NC-17 comes out from hiding], an April 2004 article from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''</ref> whereas in Italy the same film was rated [[Motion picture rating system#Italy|VM14]].

All of the songs used in the film were from the album ''[[Live at Winterland '68]]''. [[Bob Dylan]]'s song \"[[Queen Jane Approximately]]\", from the album ''[[Highway 61 Revisited]]'', is also used in the film but is not included on the soundtrack.

In the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], I-95 extends {{convert|23.50|mi|2}} from the [[George Washington Bridge]] in [[New York City]] to the [[Connecticut]] state line at [[Port Chester, New York|Port Chester]]. From the George Washington Bridge, which carries I-95 across the [[Hudson River]] from [[New Jersey]] into [[New York City]], it runs across [[upper Manhattan]] on the [[Trans-Manhattan Expressway]] and continues east across the [[Harlem River]] on the [[Alexander Hamilton Bridge]] and onto the [[Cross Bronx Expressway]]. In [[the Bronx]], I-95 leaves the Cross Bronx at the [[Bruckner Interchange]], joining the [[Bruckner Expressway]] to its end. North of the interchange with [[Pelham Parkway]], it then continues northeast via the '''New England Thruway''' (which is part of the [[New York State Thruway]] system) out of New York City into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and to the Connecticut state line, where I-95 continues on the [[Connecticut Turnpike]].\n\n==Route description==\n\n===Manhattan===\n{{main|Trans-Manhattan Expressway}}\nI-95 enters [[New York (state)|New York]] from [[New Jersey]] on the [[George Washington Bridge]] on a concurrency with [[U.S. Route 1 in New York|U.S. Route&nbsp;1]] (US&nbsp;1) and [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|US&nbsp;9]]. As the bridge's eastern approach enters [[Fort Washington Park (Manhattan)|Fort Washington Park]], I-95 enters exit&nbsp;1, which services [[New York State Route 9A]] (NY&nbsp;9A, the [[Henry Hudson Parkway]]). Access is also provided to [[181st Street (Manhattan)|181st Street]]. After crossing [[Fort Washington Avenue]], the interstate goes underground, providing a ramp to [[178th Street (Manhattan)|178th Street]], which is where US&nbsp;9 forks to [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]]. I-95 continues east under [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], entering an interchange with the [[Harlem River Drive]] along with [[Tenth Avenue (Manhattan)|Amsterdam Avenue]].<ref name=\"bing\">{{bing maps|url=http://binged.it/1b6Ecrl|title=overview map of Interstate 95|accessdate=September 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===The Bronx===\n{{see also|Cross Bronx Expressway|Bruckner Expressway}}\nAfter exit&nbsp;2, I-95 crosses over the [[Harlem River]] and enters [[the Bronx]], entering an interchange with the [[Major Deegan Expressway]] ([[Interstate 87 (New York)|I-87]]), which is marked both exit&nbsp;1C (following with the Cross Bronx Expressway) and exit&nbsp;3A&nbsp;B (matching with the Trans-Manhattan Expressway). Now the Cross-Bronx Expressway, I-95 and US&nbsp;1 continue east over University Avenue and enter exit&nbsp;2A, which serves [[Jerome Avenue]]. Crossing over the [[Grand Concourse (Bronx)|Grand Concourse]], the six-lane expressway crosses into exit&nbsp;2B, which is for [[Webster Avenue]]. This interchange also marks the eastern end of the I-95/US&nbsp;1 [[Concurrency (road)|concurrency]].

After Castle Hill Avenue, the route enters exit&nbsp;6A, which reaches the [[Hutchinson River Parkway]] at the [[Bruckner Interchange]]. Changing to the [[Bruckner Expressway]], which runs to the northeast, I-95 enters the Bruckner Interchange with the northern termini of [[Interstate 678|I-678]] and [[Interstate 278|I-278]]; the Cross Bronx Expressway Extension turns southeast along [[Interstate 295 (New York)|I-295]] at the same interchange.<ref name=\"bing\" />\n\nAfter the Bruckner Interchange, I-95 crosses Tremont Avenue before crossing over [[Interstate 695 (New York)|I-695]] (the Throgs Neck Expressway). Southbound, exit&nbsp;7A serves I-695, while northbound the two interstates merge. Continuing north, the Bruckner Expressway and I-95 parallel Bruckner Boulevard and run along the western edge of [[Pelham Bay Park]]. Entering exit&nbsp;8A southbound services Westchester Avenue while northbound, exits&nbsp;8B and 8C serve the [[Pelham Parkway (road)|Pelham Parkway]] and Shore Road through the park, which marks the northern end of the Bruckner Expressway. Now known as the New England Thruway, I-95 leaves Pelham Bay Park and enters exit&nbsp;9, a junction with the Hutchinson River Parkway.

The road turns east, crossing over [[New York State Route 127|NY&nbsp;127]] (Harrison Avenue), and enters exit&nbsp;19, the western terminus of the [[Playland Parkway]], which connects the expressway to [[Rye Playland]] as the road enters [[Rye, New York|Rye]]. The route crosses through the Rye Village area, entering exit&nbsp;20, which connects to US&nbsp;1 ([[Boston Post Road]]) and the village. Almost immediately after exit&nbsp;20, exit&nbsp;21 marks the eastern end of the [[Cross-Westchester Expressway]] ([[Interstate 287|I-287]]). Proceeding westbound, exit&nbsp;21 and nearby exit&nbsp;22 (Midland Avenue and [[Port Chester, New York|Port Chester]]) are merged, but are separate exits going eastbound.

More specifically, exit 9 on the Cross Bronx Expressway was followed immediately by exit 2 on the New England Thruway. As a result, because exit numbers on I-95 repeated themselves in close succession, the old exit numbering system frequently caused confusion.<ref>{{cite web | title=New England Thruway to Get New Exit Numbers; Last Exit to New York | website=The New York Times | date=February 17, 1980 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1980/02/17/archives/new-england-thruway-to-get-new-exit-numbers-last-exit-to-new-york.html | access-date=September 13, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAs part of an experiment, I-95 was one of the few roads in New York to receive mileage-based exit numbers. This was implemented over both the Port Authority section and the NYSDOT section of the highway (Exits 1A through 8C). The Thruway section (which had originally carried its own sequential exit numbers) was then renumbered by the Thruway Authority to a system of sequential numbers starting from 9 (where the mileage-based system left off). This led to a situation in which Exits 1 through 8 were mileage based (all but one of which contained lettered suffixes as a result) and Exits 9 through 22 were sequential.\n\nAround 2005, NYSDOT began a project to renumber I-95 with sequential numbers throughout. However the idea never fully got traction with all three agencies. The Port Authority did complete the renumbering on its section of the road. NYSDOT itself renumbered only one section of the road in Parkchester. Meanwhile, the Thruway Authority did not renumber any of the exits on its stretch of the road. This led to a situation from 2005 through 2012 in which some exits were signed with two different numbers, while some numbers were repeated twice, but only on some of the signs.\n\nFinally, in 2012, NYSDOT restored the mileage-based numbers to its portion of the highway, which once again line up with the Thruway portion. This has eliminated all of the exit number conflicts, with one exception. The exception exists because the Port Authority has not changed the numbers back on its portion of the road creating a confusing situation at the Amsterdam Avenue exit, which is maintained by NYSDOT southbound but the Port Authority northbound. The exit is signed as Exit 1B southbound (which is the proper number within the mileage-based), but as Exit 2 northbound (a holdover from the failed renumbering project).\n\n==Exit list==\nExit numbers on the New England Thruway (north of exit 8C) are sequential, but exit numbers on the remaining section are mileage-based.\n{{NYinttop|old|length_ref=<br><ref name=\"2014tdr\">{{cite web |url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/hds-respository/NYSDOT_Traffic_Data_Report_2014.pdf |title=2014 Traffic Data Report for New York State |date=July 22, 2016 |format=PDF |page=79 |publisher=[[New York State Department of Transportation]] |accessdate=September 19, 2016}}</ref><ref name=inventory>{{cite web |url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/hds-respository/HighwayInventory-NewYorkCounty-2016.zip |title=New York County Inventory Listing |date=August 7, 2015 |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |format=CSV |accessdate=January 24, 2020 |url-status=live}}\n*{{cite web |url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/hds-respository/HighwayInventory-BronxCounty-2016.zip |title=Bronx County Inventory Listing |date=August 7, 2015 |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |format=CSV |accessdate=January 24, 2020 |url-status=live}}\n*{{cite web |url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/hds-respository/HighwayInventory-WestchesterCounty-2016.zip |title=Westchester County Inventory Listing |date=August 7, 2015 |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |format=CSV |accessdate=January 24, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=google>{{google maps |url=https://goo.gl/maps/wv2qcLjgZ9r |title=Interstate 95 |accessdate=January 24, 2020}}</ref>}}\n{{Jctint|old\n|river=[[Hudson River]]\n|lspan=2\n|mile=0.00\n|exit=\u2013\n|road={{jct|state=NJ|I|95|dir1=south|US|1|US|9|dir2=south|dir3=south|US|46|dir4=west|name4=[[George Washington Bridge]]}}\n|notes=Continuation into [[New Jersey]] at the river's center; eastern terminus of US&nbsp;46\n}}\n{{Jctbridge|old\n|mile=0.00\n|mile2=0.43\n|type=toll\n|bridge=[[George Washington Bridge]] (northbound toll plaza in New Jersey)\n}}\n{{NYCint|old\n|county=New York\n|cspan=2\n|location=Manhattan\n|borough=Washington Heights\n|lspan=2\n|mile=0.43\n|exit=1\n|type=concur\n|road={{jct|state=NY|NY|9A|Parkway|Henry Hudson|US|9|dir3=north|name3=[[178th Street (Manhattan)|West 178th Street]]/West 181st Street}}\n|notes=Northern terminus of US 9 [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]]; southbound access via Lower Level lanes; exit 14 on NY 9A&nbsp;/ H.H.

[[Interstate Highway System]] that runs from [[Miami]], [[Florida]], to the [[Canada\u2013United States border]] near [[Houlton, Maine]]. In the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], I-95 extends {{convert|23.50|mi|2}} from the [[George Washington Bridge]] in [[New York City]] to the [[Connecticut]] state line at [[Port Chester, New York|Port Chester]]. From the George Washington Bridge, which carries I-95 across the [[Hudson River]] from [[New Jersey]] into [[New York City]], it runs across [[upper Manhattan]] on the [[Trans-Manhattan Expressway]] and continues east across the [[Harlem River]] on the [[Alexander Hamilton Bridge]] and onto the [[Cross Bronx Expressway]]. In [[the Bronx]], I-95 leaves the Cross Bronx at the [[Bruckner Interchange]], joining the [[Bruckner Expressway]] to its end. North of the interchange with [[Pelham Parkway]], it then continues northeast via the '''New England Thruway''' (which is part of the [[New York State Thruway]] system) out of New York City into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and to the Connecticut state line, where I-95 continues on the [[Connecticut Turnpike]].\n\n==Route description==\n\n===Manhattan===\n{{main|Trans-Manhattan Expressway}}\nI-95 enters [[New York (state)|New York]] from [[New Jersey]] on the [[George Washington Bridge]] on a concurrency with [[U.S. Route 1 in New York|U.S. Route&nbsp;1]] (US&nbsp;1) and [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|US&nbsp;9]]. As the bridge's eastern approach enters [[Fort Washington Park (Manhattan)|Fort Washington Park]], I-95 enters exit&nbsp;1, which services [[New York State Route 9A]] (NY&nbsp;9A, the [[Henry Hudson Parkway]]). Access is also provided to [[181st Street (Manhattan)|181st Street]]. After crossing [[Fort Washington Avenue]], the interstate goes underground, providing a ramp to [[178th Street (Manhattan)|178th Street]], which is where US&nbsp;9 forks to [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]]. I-95 continues east under [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], entering an interchange with the [[Harlem River Drive]] along with [[Tenth Avenue (Manhattan)|Amsterdam Avenue]].<ref name=\"bing\">{{bing maps|url=http://binged.it/1b6Ecrl|title=overview map of Interstate 95|accessdate=September 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===The Bronx===\n{{see also|Cross Bronx Expressway|Bruckner Expressway}}\nAfter exit&nbsp;2, I-95 crosses over the [[Harlem River]] and enters [[the Bronx]], entering an interchange with the [[Major Deegan Expressway]] ([[Interstate 87 (New York)|I-87]]), which is marked both exit&nbsp;1C (following with the Cross Bronx Expressway) and exit&nbsp;3A&nbsp;B (matching with the Trans-Manhattan Expressway). Now the Cross-Bronx Expressway, I-95 and US&nbsp;1 continue east over University Avenue and enter exit&nbsp;2A, which serves [[Jerome Avenue]]. Crossing over the [[Grand Concourse (Bronx)|Grand Concourse]], the six-lane expressway crosses into exit&nbsp;2B, which is for [[Webster Avenue]]. This interchange also marks the eastern end of the I-95/US&nbsp;1 [[Concurrency (road)|concurrency]]. Passing south of [[Tremont Park]], the Cross Bronx westbound serves exit&nbsp;3, which serves [[Third Avenue (Bronx)|Third Avenue]].<ref name=\"bing\" />\n[[File:Cross Bronx Expressway.jpg|thumb|left|Congestion on the Cross Bronx Expressway westbound approaching exit&nbsp;4B]]\nAt East 176th Street, the Cross Bronx Expressway turns southeast, entering exit&nbsp;4A eastbound, which marks the northern terminus of [[New York State Route 895|NY 895]] (Sheridan Boulevard).

Continuing southeast, the roadway enters exit&nbsp;5B, Castle Hill Avenue, which is an eastbound-only exit. After Castle Hill Avenue, the route enters exit&nbsp;6A, which reaches the [[Hutchinson River Parkway]] at the [[Bruckner Interchange]]. Changing to the [[Bruckner Expressway]], which runs to the northeast, I-95 enters the Bruckner Interchange with the northern termini of [[Interstate 678|I-678]] and [[Interstate 278|I-278]]; the Cross Bronx Expressway Extension turns southeast along [[Interstate 295 (New York)|I-295]] at the same interchange.<ref name=\"bing\" />\n\nAfter the Bruckner Interchange, I-95 crosses Tremont Avenue before crossing over [[Interstate 695 (New York)|I-695]] (the Throgs Neck Expressway). Southbound, exit&nbsp;7A serves I-695, while northbound the two interstates merge. Continuing north, the Bruckner Expressway and I-95 parallel Bruckner Boulevard and run along the western edge of [[Pelham Bay Park]]. Entering exit&nbsp;8A southbound services Westchester Avenue while northbound, exits&nbsp;8B and 8C serve the [[Pelham Parkway (road)|Pelham Parkway]] and Shore Road through the park, which marks the northern end of the Bruckner Expressway. Now known as the New England Thruway, I-95 leaves Pelham Bay Park and enters exit&nbsp;9, a junction with the Hutchinson River Parkway. In the middle of the interchange with the Hutchinson River, exit&nbsp;10 forks to the left, reaching [[Gun Hill Road (Bronx)|Gun Hill Road]].<ref name=\"bing\" />\n\nNow paralleling Baychester Avenue, which also services exit&nbsp;11 and Bartow Avenue, the New England Thruway continues north and enters exit&nbsp;12 which connects to [[Baychester, Bronx|Baychester]]. Conner Street is connected to via exit&nbsp;13 before I-95 turns east and crosses over the [[Hutchinson River]]. After crossing the river, the route enters an interchange once again with the Hutchinson River Parkway (exit&nbsp;14) but this time westbound only.<ref name=\"bing\" />\n\n===Westchester===\n[[File:NewEngThruway.svg|75px|thumb|Shield for the New England Thruway used between 1958 and 1970.]]\nCrossing through the northern reaches of Pelham Bay Park, I-95 turns more northeast and enters [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. Now in [[Pelham Manor, New York|Pelham Manor]], the route crosses through [[Pelham Country Club]], entering exit&nbsp;15, which connects to US&nbsp;1 (Main Street). After US&nbsp;1, the route crosses out of the Pelham Country Club, entering [[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]].<ref name=\"bing\" />\n\nCrossing over [[Metro-North Railroad]] tracks, the interstate turns northeast and crossing through downtown New Rochelle, reaching exit&nbsp;16, serving several local streets including Cross Avenue, Cedar Street and Garden Street. North of exit&nbsp;16, the New England Thruway enters its lone [[open road tolling|toll gantry]] along the alignment, serving the northbound direction only.

More specifically, exit 9 on the Cross Bronx Expressway was followed immediately by exit 2 on the New England Thruway. As a result, because exit numbers on I-95 repeated themselves in close succession, the old exit numbering system frequently caused confusion.<ref>{{cite web | title=New England Thruway to Get New Exit Numbers; Last Exit to New York | website=The New York Times | date=February 17, 1980 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1980/02/17/archives/new-england-thruway-to-get-new-exit-numbers-last-exit-to-new-york.html | access-date=September 13, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAs part of an experiment, I-95 was one of the few roads in New York to receive mileage-based exit numbers. This was implemented over both the Port Authority section and the NYSDOT section of the highway (Exits 1A through 8C). The Thruway section (which had originally carried its own sequential exit numbers) was then renumbered by the Thruway Authority to a system of sequential numbers starting from 9 (where the mileage-based system left off). This led to a situation in which Exits 1 through 8 were mileage based (all but one of which contained lettered suffixes as a result) and Exits 9 through 22 were sequential.\n\nAround 2005, NYSDOT began a project to renumber I-95 with sequential numbers throughout. However the idea never fully got traction with all three agencies. The Port Authority did complete the renumbering on its section of the road. NYSDOT itself renumbered only one section of the road in Parkchester. Meanwhile, the Thruway Authority did not renumber any of the exits on its stretch of the road. This led to a situation from 2005 through 2012 in which some exits were signed with two different numbers, while some numbers were repeated twice, but only on some of the signs.\n\nFinally, in 2012, NYSDOT restored the mileage-based numbers to its portion of the highway, which once again line up with the Thruway portion. This has eliminated all of the exit number conflicts, with one exception. The exception exists because the Port Authority has not changed the numbers back on its portion of the road creating a confusing situation at the Amsterdam Avenue exit, which is maintained by NYSDOT southbound but the Port Authority northbound. The exit is signed as Exit 1B southbound (which is the proper number within the mileage-based), but as Exit 2 northbound (a holdover from the failed renumbering project).\n\n==Exit list==\nExit numbers on the New England Thruway (north of exit 8C) are sequential, but exit numbers on the remaining section are mileage-based.\n{{NYinttop|old|length_ref=<br><ref name=\"2014tdr\">{{cite web |url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/hds-respository/NYSDOT_Traffic_Data_Report_2014.pdf |title=2014 Traffic Data Report for New York State |date=July 22, 2016 |format=PDF |page=79 |publisher=[[New York State Department of Transportation]] |accessdate=September 19, 2016}}</ref><ref name=inventory>{{cite web |url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/hds-respository/HighwayInventory-NewYorkCounty-2016.zip |title=New York County Inventory Listing |date=August 7, 2015 |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |format=CSV |accessdate=January 24, 2020 |url-status=live}}\n*{{cite web |url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/hds-respository/HighwayInventory-BronxCounty-2016.zip |title=Bronx County Inventory Listing |date=August 7, 2015 |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |format=CSV |accessdate=January 24, 2020 |url-status=live}}\n*{{cite web |url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/hds-respository/HighwayInventory-WestchesterCounty-2016.zip |title=Westchester County Inventory Listing |date=August 7, 2015 |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |format=CSV |accessdate=January 24, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=google>{{google maps |url=https://goo.gl/maps/wv2qcLjgZ9r |title=Interstate 95 |accessdate=January 24, 2020}}</ref>}}\n{{Jctint|old\n|river=[[Hudson River]]\n|lspan=2\n|mile=0.00\n|exit=\u2013\n|road={{jct|state=NJ|I|95|dir1=south|US|1|US|9|dir2=south|dir3=south|US|46|dir4=west|name4=[[George Washington Bridge]]}}\n|notes=Continuation into [[New Jersey]] at the river's center; eastern terminus of US&nbsp;46\n}}\n{{Jctbridge|old\n|mile=0.00\n|mile2=0.43\n|type=toll\n|bridge=[[George Washington Bridge]] (northbound toll plaza in New Jersey)\n}}\n{{NYCint|old\n|county=New York\n|cspan=2\n|location=Manhattan\n|borough=Washington Heights\n|lspan=2\n|mile=0.43\n|exit=1\n|type=concur\n|road={{jct|state=NY|NY|9A|Parkway|Henry Hudson|US|9|dir3=north|name3=[[178th Street (Manhattan)|West 178th Street]]/[[West 181st Street (Manhattan)|West 181st Street]]}}\n|notes=Northern terminus of US 9 [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]]; southbound access via Lower Level lanes; exit 14 on NY 9A&nbsp;/ H.H.
