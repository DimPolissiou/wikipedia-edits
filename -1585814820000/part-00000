Stiglitz and Rothschild showed three plausible definitions of a variable X being 'more variable' than a variable Y were all equivalent - Y being equal to X plus noise, every risk averse agent preferring Y to X, and Y having more weight in its tails, and that none of these were always consistent with X having a higher statistical variance than Y - a commonly used definition at the time. In a second paper, they analyzed the theoretical consequences of risk aversion in various circumstances,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Stiglitz | first1 = Joseph E. | last2 = Rothschild | first2 = Michael | year = | title = Increasing Risk II. Its economic consequences | url = | journal = Journal of Economic Theory | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 66\u201384 }}</ref> such as an individual's savings decisions and a firm's production decisions.\n\n===Henry George theorem===\nStiglitz made early contributions to a theory of public finance stating that an optimal supply of local [[public goods]] can be funded entirely through [[value capture|capture]] of the [[land (economics)|land]] [[economic rent|rents]] generated by those goods (when population distributions are optimal). Stiglitz dubbed this the '[[Henry George theorem]]' in reference to the radical [[classical economist]] [[Henry George]] who famously advocated for [[land value tax]]. The explanation behind Stiglitz's finding is that rivalry for public goods takes place geographically, so competition for access to any beneficial public good will increase land values by at least as much as its outlay cost. Furthermore, Stiglitz shows that a [[Georgism|single tax on rents]] is necessary to provide the optimal supply of local public investment. Stiglitz also shows how the theorem could be used to find the optimal size of a city or firm.<ref>Richard J. Arnott & Joseph E.

It was for this contribution to the theory of [[information asymmetry]] that he shared the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics<ref name=NOBEL1 /> in 2001 \"for laying the foundations for [[information asymmetry|the theory of markets with asymmetric information]]\" with [[George A. Akerlof]] and [[A. Michael Spence]].\n\nMuch of Stiglitz' work on [[Information economics]] demonstrates situations in which incomplete information prevents markets from achieving social efficiency. His paper with [[Andrew Weiss (economist)|Andrew Weiss]] showed that if banks use interest rates to infer information about borrowers' types (adverse selection effect) or to encourage their actions following borrowing (incentive effect), then credit will be rationed below the optimal level, even in a competitive market.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stiglitz|first=Joseph|last2=Weiss|first2=Andrew|date=February 1987|title=Macro-Economic Equilibrium and Credit Rationing|location=Cambridge, MA|doi=10.3386/w2164}}</ref> Stiglitz and [[Michael Rothschild|Rothschild]]  showed that in an insurance market, firms have an incentive to undermine a 'pooling equilibrium', where all agents are offered the same full-insurance policy, by offering cheaper partial insurance that would only attractive to the low-risk types, meaning that a competitive market can only achieve partial coverage of agents.<ref>{{Citation|last=Rothschild|first=Michael|title=Equilibrium in Competitive Insurance Markets: An Essay on the Economics of Imperfect Information|date=1976|work=Foundations of Insurance Economics|pages=355\u2013375|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789048157891|last2=Stiglitz|first2=Joseph|doi=10.1007/978-94-015-7957-5_18}}</ref> Stiglitz and [[Sanford J.

If the demand for labour falls, this lowers wages. But because wages have fallen, the probability of 'shirking' (workers not exerting effort) has risen. If employment levels are to be maintained, through a sufficient lowering of wages, workers will be less productive than before through the shirking effect. As a consequence, in the model, wages do not fall enough to maintain employment levels at the previous state, because firms want to avoid excessive shirking by their workers. So, unemployment must rise during recessions, because wages are kept 'too high'.\n# Possible corollary: Wage sluggishness. Moving from one private cost of hiring (w\u2217) to another private cost of hiring (w\u2217\u2217) will require each firm to repeatedly re-optimize wages in response to shifting unemployment rate. Firms cannot cut wages until unemployment rises sufficiently (a coordination problem).\n\nThe outcome is never Pareto efficient.\n\n# Each firm employs too few workers because it faces private cost of hiring rather than the social cost{{snd}} which is equal to and in all cases.{{Clarify|date=January 2014}}  This means that firms do not \"internalize\" the \"external\" cost of unemployment{{snd}} they do not factor how large-scale unemployment harms society when assessing their own costs.  This leads to a negative externality as marginal social cost exceeds the firm's marginal cost (MSC = Firm's Private Marginal Cost + Marginal External Cost of increased social unemployment){{Clarify|date=January 2010}}\n# There are also positive externalities: each firm increases the asset value of unemployment for all other firms when they hire during recessions.  By creating hypercompetitive labor markets, all firms (the winners when laborers compete) experience an increase in value.  However, this effect of increased valuation is very unapparent, because the first problem (the negative externality of sub-optimal hiring) clearly dominates since the 'natural rate of unemployment' is always too high.\n\n===Practical implications of Stiglitz' theories===\nThe practical implications of Stiglitz' work in [[political economy]] and their [[economic policy]] implications have been subject to debate.<ref name=DISENSUS>{{cite web|url=http://www.developmentinpractice.org/apc_ap-v14n3x525073q.html |title=Consensus, dissensus, confusion: the 'Stiglitz Debate' in perspective |accessdate=2007-08-03 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070422032304/http://www.developmentinpractice.org/apc_ap-v14n3x525073q.html |archivedate=2007-04-22 }}</ref> Stiglitz himself has evolved his political-economic discourse over time.<ref name=DEBATE2>{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/15630 |author=Friedman, Benjamin M. |title= Globalization: Stiglitz's Case. |publisher=The New York Review of Books, Volume 49, Number 13  |website=Nybooks.com |date=August 15, 2002 |accessdate=October 29, 2013}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Once incomplete and imperfect information are introduced, Chicago-school defenders of the market system cannot sustain descriptive claims of the Pareto efficiency of the real world.

He believes that China should \"react with strength and intelligence\" and hit the United States \"where it hurts economically and politically\" if the United States tries to protect its industry and rebalance its trade account through tariffs, saying: \"For example, cutbacks in purchases by China will lead to more unemployment in congressional districts that are vulnerable, influential, or both\".<ref name=\":1\" /> ...

And it is not the level of exports that matters but rather the trade balance (gap between imports and exports). Regarding the United States, he writes the opposite: \"Walking away from globalization may reduce our imports, but it will also reduce exports in tandem. And, almost surely, jobs will be destroyed faster than they will be created: there may even be fewer net manufacturing jobs\". If the United States tries to control the movement of goods, \"they surely will lose\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn early 2017, he wrote that \"the American middle class is indeed the loser of globalization\" and \"China, with its large emerging middle class, is among the big beneficiaries of globalization\". \"Thanks to globalisation, in terms of purchasing-power parity, China actually  has already become the largest economy in the world in September 2015\".<ref name=\":1\" /> However, he then changed his mind and argued that the fall in wages and the disappearance of well-paid jobs in the United States, are not due to globalization, but are only inevitable collateral damage to the march of economic progress and technological innovation: \"The United States can only push for advanced manufacturing, which requires higher skill sets and employs fewer people. Rising inequality, meanwhile, will continue ...\".<ref name=\":2\"/> Finally, he changed his mind again in late 2017 and wrote that the drop in wages in the United States, is not a normal process and is solely due to the actions of multinational companies, not to the trade account imbalances between countries caused by free trade: \"It was an agenda written by and for large multinational companies, at the expense of workers\". So it is no longer the surplus countries that have benefited from free trade, but only companies.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nIn 2016, he said he believes that the economic situation of the United States is critical: \"As the economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton showed in their study published in December 2015, life expectancy among middle-age white Americans is declining, as rates of suicides, drug use, and alcoholism increase. A year later, the National Center for Health Statistics reported that life expectancy for the country as a whole has declined for the first time in more than 20 years.\"<ref name=\":2\"/> ... With the incomes of the bottom 90% having stagnated for close to a third of a century (and declining for a significant proportion), the health data simply confirmed that things were not going well for swaths of the country\".<ref name=\":3\" /> However, he changed his mind again in 2017 and now thinks that the effect of globalization on the American economy is not so serious today: \"Yes, America faces a variety of problems\u2014it always has, and what nation doesn't?\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Books==\nAlong with his technical economic publications (he has published over 300 technical articles), Stiglitz is the author of books on issues from patent law to abuses in international trade.\n\n===''Whither Socialism?'' (1994) ===\n''[[Whither Socialism?]]'' is based on Stiglitz's Wicksell Lectures, presented at the [[Stockholm School of Economics]] in 1990 and presents a summary of [[information economics]] and the theory of markets with imperfect information and imperfect competition, as well as being a critique of both free market and market socialist approaches (see Roemer critique, op. cit.).  Stiglitz explains how the [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical]], or [[Walrasian model]] (\"Walrasian economics\" refers to the result of the process which has given birth to a formal representation of [[Adam Smith]]'s notion of the \"invisible hand\", along the lines put forward by [[L\u00e9on Walras]] and encapsulated in the general equilibrium model of [[Arrow\u2013Debreu model|Arrow\u2013Debreu]]), may have wrongly encouraged the belief that [[market socialism]] could work. Stiglitz proposes an alternative model, based on the [[information economics]] established by the Greenwald\u2013Stiglitz theorems.\n\nOne of the reasons Stiglitz sees for the critical failing in the standard [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical model]], on which [[market socialism]] was built, is its failure to consider the problems that arise from lack of perfect information and from the costs of acquiring information. He also identifies problems arising from its assumptions concerning completeness.<ref name=ZAPIA>{{cite web|url=http://www.econ-pol.unisi.it/pubdocenti/HEI99.pdf |author=Zapia, Carlo |title=The economics of information, market socialism and Hayek's legacy |publisher=Dipartimento di Economia Politica, Universit\u00e0 di Siena |accessdate=October 29, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614110711/http://www.econ-pol.unisi.it/pubdocenti/HEI99.pdf |archivedate=June 14, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===''Globalization and Its Discontents'' (2002)===\nIn ''[[Globalization and Its Discontents]]'', Stiglitz argues that what are often called \"developing economies\" are, in fact, not developing at all, and puts much of the blame on the IMF.\n\nStiglitz bases his argument on the themes that his decades of theoretical work have emphasized: namely, what happens when people lack the key information that bears on the decisions they have to make, or when markets for important kinds of transactions are inadequate or don't exist, or when other institutions that standard economic thinking takes for granted are absent or flawed. Stiglitz stresses the point: \"Recent advances in economic theory\" (in part referring to his own work) \"have shown that whenever information is imperfect and markets incomplete, which is to say always, and especially in developing countries, then the invisible hand works most imperfectly.\" As a result, Stiglitz continues, governments can improve the outcome by well-chosen interventions. Stiglitz argues that when families and firms seek to buy too little compared to what the economy can produce, governments can fight recessions and depressions by using expansionary monetary and fiscal policies to spur the demand for goods and services. At the microeconomic level, governments can regulate banks and other financial institutions to keep them sound. They can also use tax policy to steer investment into more productive industries and trade policies to allow new industries to mature to the point at which they can survive foreign competition. And governments can use a variety of devices, ranging from job creation to manpower training to welfare assistance, to put unemployed labor back to work and cushion human hardship.\n\nStiglitz complains bitterly that the IMF has done great damage through the economic policies it has prescribed that countries must follow in order to qualify for IMF loans, or for loans from banks and other private-sector lenders that look to the IMF to indicate whether a borrower is creditworthy. The organization and its officials, he argues, have ignored the implications of incomplete information, inadequate markets, and unworkable institutions{{snd}} all of which are especially characteristic of newly developing countries. As a result, Stiglitz argues, the IMF has often called for policies that conform to textbook economics but do not make sense for the countries to which the IMF is recommending them. Stiglitz seeks to show that these policies have been disastrous for the countries that have followed them.\n\n===''The Roaring Nineties'' (2003)===\n''The Roaring Nineties'' is Stiglitz' analysis of the boom and bust of the 1990s. Presented from an insider's point of view, firstly as chair of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisors, and later as chief economist of the World Bank, it continues his argument on how misplaced faith in free-market ideology led to the global economic issues of today, with a perceptive focus on US policies.\n\n===''New Paradigm for Monetary Economics'' (2003)===\n{{Expand section|date=August 2019}}\n\n===''Fair Trade for All'' (2005)===\nIn ''Fair Trade for All'', authors Stiglitz and Andrew Charlton argue that it is important to make the trading world more development friendly.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Blandford | first1 = David | year = | title = review of ''Fair Trade for All'', by J.E.

Dr. Stiglitz argues that through tariffs, subsidies, an over-complex patent system and pollution, the world is being both economically and politically destabilised. Stiglitz argues that strong, transparent institutions are needed to address these problems. He shows how an examination of incomplete markets can make corrective government policies desirable.\n\nStiglitz is an exception to the general pro-globalisation view of professional economists, according to economist [[Martin Wolf]].<ref name=preface>\"Why Globalization Works\" (Yale University Press 2004) {{ISBN|978-0-300-10252-9}}, p. 8. Also Wolf criticizes World Bank heavily (pp. xiii\u2013xv).</ref> Stiglitz argues that economic opportunities are not widely enough available, that financial crises are too costly and too frequent, and that the rich countries have done too little to address these problems. ''Making Globalization Work''<ref>see {{YouTube|UzhD7KVs-R4|Stiglitz discuss his book}}</ref> has sold more than two million copies.\n\n===''Stability with Growth'' (2006)===\nIn ''[[Stability with Growth: Macroeconomics, Liberalization and Development]]'', Stiglitz, [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Ocampo]] (United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, until 2007), Shari Spiegel (Managing Director, Initiative for Policy Dialogue{{snd}} IPD), Ricardo Ffrench-Davis (Main Adviser, Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean{{snd}} [[ECLAC]]) and [[Deepak Nayyar]] (Vice Chancellor, University of Delhi) discuss the current debates on macroeconomics, capital market liberalization and development, and develop a new framework within which one can assess alternative policies. They explain their belief that the [[Washington Consensus]] has advocated narrow goals for development (with a focus on price stability) and prescribed too few policy instruments (emphasizing monetary and fiscal policies), and places unwarranted faith in the role of markets. The new framework focuses on real stability and long-term sustainable and equitable growth, offers a variety of non-standard ways to stabilize the economy and promote growth, and accepts that market imperfections necessitate government interventions. Policy-makers have pursued stabilization goals with little concern for growth consequences, while trying to increase growth through structural reforms focused on improving economic efficiency. Moreover, structural policies, such as capital market liberalization, have had major consequences for economic stability. This book challenges these policies by arguing that stabilization policy has important consequences for long-term growth and has often been implemented with adverse consequences. The first part of the book introduces the key questions and looks at the objectives of economic policy from different perspectives. The third part presents a similar analysis for capital market liberalization.\n\n===''The Three Trillion Dollar War'' (2008)===\n''[[The Three Trillion Dollar War]]'' (co-authored with [[Linda Bilmes]]) examines the full cost of the Iraq War, including many hidden costs. The book also discusses the extent to which these costs will be imposed for many years to come, paying special attention to the enormous expenditures that will be required to care for very large numbers of wounded veterans. Stiglitz was openly critical of George W. Bush at the time the book was released.<ref>{{cite news |first=Kevin|last=Perry |title=Joseph Stiglitz interview about ''The Three Trillion Dollar War'' |url=http://kevinegperry.com/2008/03/04/joseph-stiglitz-interview-the-3-trillion-war/ |publisher=[[The Beaver (newspaper)|The Beaver]] |date=March 4, 2008 |accessdate=September 29, 2010 | location=London}}</ref>\n\n===''Freefall'' (2010)===\n{{Main|Freefall: America, Free Markets, and the Sinking of the World Economy}}\n\nIn ''Freefall: America, Free Markets, and the Sinking of the World Economy'', Stiglitz discusses the causes of the 2008 recession/depression and goes on to propose reforms needed to avoid a repetition of a similar crisis, advocating government intervention and regulation in a number of areas. Among the policy-makers he criticises are George W. Bush, Larry Summers, and Barack Obama.<ref>{{cite news |first=Joel|last=Krupa |title=Guiding the Invisible Hand |url=http://www.oxonianreview.org/wp/guiding-the-invisible-hand/ |date=June 7, 2010 |accessdate=December 28, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===''The Price of Inequality'' (2012)===\nFrom the jacket: As those at the top continue to enjoy the best health care, education, and benefits of wealth, they often fail to realize that, as Joseph E. Stiglitz highlights, \"their fate is bound up with how the other 99 percent live ... It does not have to be this way.  In ''[[The Price of Inequality]]'' Stiglitz lays out a comprehensive agenda to create a more dynamic economy and fairer and more equal society\"\n\nThe book received the [[Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights]] 2013 Book Award, given annually to the book that \"most faithfully and forcefully reflects Robert Kennedy's purposes{{snd}} his concern for the poor and the powerless, his struggle for honest and even-handed justice, his conviction that a decent society must assure all young people a fair chance, and his faith that a free democracy can act to remedy disparities of power and opportunity.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Book Award |url=http://rfkcenter.org/book-award?lang=en |publisher=RFKcenter.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619072045/http://rfkcenter.org/book-award?lang=en |archivedate=2015-06-19 }}</ref>\n\n===''Creating a Learning Society: A New Approach to Growth, Development, and Social Progress'' (2014)===\nCreating a Learning Society, (co authored with Bruce C. Greenwald), cast light on the significance of this insight for economic theory and policy. Taking as a starting point Kenneth J. Arrow's 1962 paper \"Learning by Doing\", they explain why the production of knowledge differs from that of other goods and why market economies alone typically do not produce and transmit knowledge efficiently. Closing knowledge gaps and helping laggards learn are central to growth and development. But creating a learning society is equally crucial if we are to sustain improved living standards in advanced countries.\n\n===''The Great Divide: Unequal Societies and What We Can Do About Them'' (2015)===\nFrom the jacket: In ''The Great Divide'', Joseph E. Stiglitz expands on the diagnosis he offered in his best-selling book ''The Price of Inequality'' and suggests ways to counter America's growing problem. Stiglitz argues that inequality is a choice{{snd}} the cumulative result of unjust policies and misguided priorities.\n\n===''The Euro: How a Common Currency Threatens the Future of Europe'' (2016)===\n{{Expand section|date=August 2019}}\n\n===''People, Power and Profits: Progressive Capitalism for an Age of Discontent'' (2019)===\n{{Expand section|date=August 2019}}\n\n===''Measuring What Counts; The Global Movement for Well-Being'' (2019)===\nStiglitz and his coauthors point out that the interrelated crises of environmental degradation and human suffering of our current age demonstrate that \"something is fundamentally wrong with the way we assess economic performance and social progress.\" They argue that using GDP as the chief measure of our economic health does not provide an accurate assessment of the economy or the state of the world and the people living in it.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Queally |first1=Jon |title='Everything Is Not Fine': Nobel Economist Calls on Humanity to End Obsession With GDP |url=https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/11/25/everything-not-fine-nobel-economist-calls-humanity-end-obsession-gdp |website=Common Dreams |accessdate=10 December 2019 |date=25 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Stiglitz |first1=Joseph |title=It's time to retire metrics like GDP.

As the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers during the first term of the Clinton Administration and former chief economist at the [[World Bank]], Stiglitz was able to put some of his views into action. For example, he was an outspoken critic of quickly opening up financial markets in developing countries. These markets rely on access to good financial data and sound bankruptcy laws, but he argued that many of these countries didn't have the regulatory institutions needed to ensure that the markets would operate soundly.\n\n==Awards and honors==\nIn addition to being awarded the Nobel Memorial prize, Stiglitz has over 40 honorary doctorates and at least eight honorary professorships as well as an honorary deanship.<ref name=\"cv\">[http://www2.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty/jstiglitz/download/Stiglitz_CV.pdf Curriculum Vitae] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513134138/http://www2.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty/jstiglitz/download/Stiglitz_CV.pdf |date=2011-05-13 }}, Joseph E.

Stiglitz and Rothschild showed three plausible definitions of a variable X being 'more variable' than a variable Y were all equivalent - Y being equal to X plus noise, every risk averse agent preferring Y to X, and Y having more weight in its tails, and that none of these were always consistent with X having a higher statistical variance than Y - a commonly used definition at the time. In a second paper, they analyzed the theoretical consequences of risk aversion in various circumstances,<ref>Stiglitz, Joseph E. and Michael Rothschild. \"Increasing Risk II. Its economic consequences.\" Journal of Economic Theory, Vol. 3, No. 1, March 1971, pp. 66-84.

Stiglitz dubbed this the '[[Henry George theorem]]' in reference to the radical [[classical economist]] [[Henry George]] who famously advocated for [[land value tax]]. The explanation behind Stiglitz's finding is that rivalry for public goods takes place geographically, so competition for access to any beneficial public good will increase land values by at least as much as its outlay cost. Furthermore, Stiglitz shows that a [[Georgism|single tax on rents]] is necessary to provide the optimal supply of local public investment. Stiglitz also shows how the theorem could be used to find the optimal size of a city or firm.<ref>Richard J. Arnott & Joseph E.

It was for this contribution to the theory of [[information asymmetry]] that he shared the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics<ref name=NOBEL1 /> in 2001 \"for laying the foundations for [[information asymmetry|the theory of markets with asymmetric information]]\" with [[George A. Akerlof]] and [[A. Michael Spence]].\n\nMuch of Stiglitz' work on [[Information economics]] demonstrates situations in which incomplete information prevents markets from achieving social efficiency. His paper with [[Andrew Weiss (economist)|Andrew Weiss]] showed that if banks use interest rates to infer information about borrowers' types (adverse selection effect) or to encourage their actions following borrowing (incentive effect), then credit will be rationed below the optimal level, even in a competitive market.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stiglitz|first=Joseph|last2=Weiss|first2=Andrew|date=February 1987|title=Macro-Economic Equilibrium and Credit Rationing|location=Cambridge, MA|doi=10.3386/w2164}}</ref> Stiglitz and [[Michael Rothschild|Rothschild]]  showed that in an insurance market, firms have an incentive to undermine a 'pooling equilibrium', where all agents are offered the same full-insurance policy, by offering cheaper partial insurance that would only attractive to the low-risk types, meaning that a competitive market can only achieve partial coverage of agents.<ref>{{Citation|last=Rothschild|first=Michael|title=Equilibrium in Competitive Insurance Markets: An Essay on the Economics of Imperfect Information|date=1976|work=Foundations of Insurance Economics|pages=355\u2013375|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789048157891|last2=Stiglitz|first2=Joseph|doi=10.1007/978-94-015-7957-5_18}}</ref> Stiglitz and [[Sanford J.

Because of this, the curve for the no-shirking condition (labeled NSC) goes to infinity at full employment.]]\n\nStiglitz also did research on [[efficiency wages]], and helped create what became known as the \"Shapiro\u2013Stiglitz model\" to explain why there is unemployment even in equilibrium, why wages are not bid down sufficiently by job seekers (in the absence of minimum wages) so that everyone who wants a job finds one, and to question whether the [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical paradigm]] could explain [[involuntary unemployment]].<ref name = SHAPIROSTGLTZARTCL/>  An answer to these puzzles was proposed by [[Carl Shapiro|Shapiro]] and Stiglitz in 1984: \"Unemployment is driven by the information structure of employment\".<ref name=SHAPIROSTGLTZARTCL>{{cite journal | last1 = Stiglitz | first1 = Joseph E. | last2 = Shapiro | first2 = Carl | title = Equilibrium unemployment as a worker discipline device | journal = [[The American Economic Review]] | volume = 74 | issue = 3 | pages = 433\u201344 | publisher = [[American Economic Association]] via [[JSTOR]] | date = June 1984 | jstor = 1804018 | ref = harv }}</ref> Two basic observations undergird their analysis:\n\n# Unlike other forms of capital, humans can choose their level of effort.\n# It is costly for firms to determine how much effort workers are exerting.\n\nA full description of this model can be found at the links provided.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://coin.wne.uw.edu.pl/lwincenciak/docs/lecture_4.pdf|title=Lecture 4|date=May 22, 2007|website=coin.wne.uw.edu.pl|access-date=March 16, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715112948/http://coin.wne.uw.edu.pl/lwincenciak/docs/lecture_4.pdf|archive-date=July 15, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=SHAPIROSTGLTZMATH>{{cite web |url=http://coin.wne.uw.edu.pl/lwincenciak/docs/lecture_4.pdf |title=Efficiency wages, the Shapiro-Stiglitz Model |date= |accessdate=October 29, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715112948/http://coin.wne.uw.edu.pl/lwincenciak/docs/lecture_4.pdf |archive-date=July 15, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Some key implications of this model are:\n\n# Wages do not fall enough during recessions to prevent unemployment from rising. If the demand for labour falls, this lowers wages. But because wages have fallen, the probability of 'shirking' (workers not exerting effort) has risen. If employment levels are to be maintained, through a sufficient lowering of wages, workers will be less productive than before through the shirking effect. As a consequence, in the model, wages do not fall enough to maintain employment levels at the previous state, because firms want to avoid excessive shirking by their workers. So, unemployment must rise during recessions, because wages are kept 'too high'.\n# Possible corollary: Wage sluggishness. Moving from one private cost of hiring (w\u2217) to another private cost of hiring (w\u2217\u2217) will require each firm to repeatedly re-optimize wages in response to shifting unemployment rate. Firms cannot cut wages until unemployment rises sufficiently (a coordination problem).\n\nThe outcome is never Pareto efficient.\n\n# Each firm employs too few workers because it faces private cost of hiring rather than the social cost{{snd}} which is equal to and in all cases.{{Clarify|date=January 2014}}  This means that firms do not \"internalize\" the \"external\" cost of unemployment{{snd}} they do not factor how large-scale unemployment harms society when assessing their own costs.  This leads to a negative externality as marginal social cost exceeds the firm's marginal cost (MSC = Firm's Private Marginal Cost + Marginal External Cost of increased social unemployment){{Clarify|date=January 2010}}\n# There are also positive externalities: each firm increases the asset value of unemployment for all other firms when they hire during recessions.  By creating hypercompetitive labor markets, all firms (the winners when laborers compete) experience an increase in value.  However, this effect of increased valuation is very unapparent, because the first problem (the negative externality of sub-optimal hiring) clearly dominates since the 'natural rate of unemployment' is always too high.\n\n===Practical implications of Stiglitz' theories===\nThe practical implications of Stiglitz' work in [[political economy]] and their [[economic policy]] implications have been subject to debate.<ref name=DISENSUS>{{cite web|url=http://www.developmentinpractice.org/apc_ap-v14n3x525073q.html |title=Consensus, dissensus, confusion: the 'Stiglitz Debate' in perspective |accessdate=2007-08-03 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070422032304/http://www.developmentinpractice.org/apc_ap-v14n3x525073q.html |archivedate=2007-04-22 }}</ref> Stiglitz himself has evolved his political-economic discourse over time.<ref name=DEBATE2>{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/15630 |author=Friedman, Benjamin M. |title= Globalization: Stiglitz's Case. |publisher=The New York Review of Books, Volume 49, Number 13  |website=Nybooks.com |date=August 15, 2002 |accessdate=October 29, 2013}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Once incomplete and imperfect information are introduced, Chicago-school defenders of the market system cannot sustain descriptive claims of the Pareto efficiency of the real world.

He became deeply involved in environmental issues, which included serving on the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], and helping draft a new law for toxic wastes (which was never passed).\n\nStiglitz's most important contribution in this period was helping define a new economic philosophy, a \"third way\", which postulated the important, but limited, role of government, that unfettered markets often did not work well, but that government was not always able to correct the limitations of markets. The academic research that he had been conducting over the preceding 25 years provided the intellectual foundations for this \"third way\".\n\nWhen President [[Bill Clinton]] was re-elected, he asked Stiglitz to continue to serve as Chairman of the [[Council of Economic Advisers]] for another term.

And it is not the level of exports that matters but rather the trade balance (gap between imports and exports). Regarding the United States, he writes the opposite: \"Walking away from globalization may reduce our imports, but it will also reduce exports in tandem. And, almost surely, jobs will be destroyed faster than they will be created: there may even be fewer net manufacturing jobs\". If the United States tries to control the movement of goods, \"they surely will lose\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn early 2017, he wrote that \"the American middle class is indeed the loser of globalization\" and \"China, with its large emerging middle class, is among the big beneficiaries of globalization\". \"Thanks to globalisation, in terms of purchasing-power parity, China actually  has already become the largest economy in the world in September 2015\".<ref name=\":1\" /> However, he then changed his mind and argued that the fall in wages and the disappearance of well-paid jobs in the United States, are not due to globalization, but are only inevitable collateral damage to the march of economic progress and technological innovation: \"The United States can only push for advanced manufacturing, which requires higher skill sets and employs fewer people. Rising inequality, meanwhile, will continue ...\".<ref name=\":2\"/> Finally, he changed his mind again in late 2017 and wrote that the drop in wages in the United States, is not a normal process and is solely due to the actions of multinational companies, not to the trade account imbalances between countries caused by free trade: \"It was an agenda written by and for large multinational companies, at the expense of workers\". So it is no longer the surplus countries that have benefited from free trade, but only companies.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nIn 2016, he said he believes that the economic situation of the United States is critical: \"As the economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton showed in their study published in December 2015, life expectancy among middle-age white Americans is declining, as rates of suicides, drug use, and alcoholism increase. A year later, the National Center for Health Statistics reported that life expectancy for the country as a whole has declined for the first time in more than 20 years.\"<ref name=\":2\"/> ... With the incomes of the bottom 90% having stagnated for close to a third of a century (and declining for a significant proportion), the health data simply confirmed that things were not going well for swaths of the country\".<ref name=\":3\" /> However, he changed his mind again in 2017 and now thinks that the effect of globalization on the American economy is not so serious today: \"Yes, America faces a variety of problems\u2014it always has, and what nation doesn't?\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Books==\nAlong with his technical economic publications (he has published over 300 technical articles), Stiglitz is the author of books on issues from patent law to abuses in international trade.\n\n===''Whither Socialism?'' (1994) ===\n''[[Whither Socialism?]]'' is based on Stiglitz's Wicksell Lectures, presented at the [[Stockholm School of Economics]] in 1990 and presents a summary of [[information economics]] and the theory of markets with imperfect information and imperfect competition, as well as being a critique of both free market and market socialist approaches (see Roemer critique, op. cit.).  Stiglitz explains how the [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical]], or [[Walrasian model]] (\"Walrasian economics\" refers to the result of the process which has given birth to a formal representation of [[Adam Smith]]'s notion of the \"invisible hand\", along the lines put forward by [[L\u00e9on Walras]] and encapsulated in the general equilibrium model of [[Arrow\u2013Debreu model|Arrow\u2013Debreu]]), may have wrongly encouraged the belief that [[market socialism]] could work. Stiglitz proposes an alternative model, based on the [[information economics]] established by the Greenwald\u2013Stiglitz theorems.\n\nOne of the reasons Stiglitz sees for the critical failing in the standard [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical model]], on which [[market socialism]] was built, is its failure to consider the problems that arise from lack of perfect information and from the costs of acquiring information. He also identifies problems arising from its assumptions concerning completeness.<ref name=ZAPIA>{{cite web|url=http://www.econ-pol.unisi.it/pubdocenti/HEI99.pdf |author=Zapia, Carlo |title=The economics of information, market socialism and Hayek's legacy |publisher=Dipartimento di Economia Politica, Universit\u00e0 di Siena |accessdate=October 29, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614110711/http://www.econ-pol.unisi.it/pubdocenti/HEI99.pdf |archivedate=June 14, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===''Globalization and Its Discontents'' (2002)===\nIn ''[[Globalization and Its Discontents]]'', Stiglitz argues that what are often called \"developing economies\" are, in fact, not developing at all, and puts much of the blame on the IMF.\n\nStiglitz bases his argument on the themes that his decades of theoretical work have emphasized: namely, what happens when people lack the key information that bears on the decisions they have to make, or when markets for important kinds of transactions are inadequate or don't exist, or when other institutions that standard economic thinking takes for granted are absent or flawed. Stiglitz stresses the point: \"Recent advances in economic theory\" (in part referring to his own work) \"have shown that whenever information is imperfect and markets incomplete, which is to say always, and especially in developing countries, then the invisible hand works most imperfectly.\" As a result, Stiglitz continues, governments can improve the outcome by well-chosen interventions. Stiglitz argues that when families and firms seek to buy too little compared to what the economy can produce, governments can fight recessions and depressions by using expansionary monetary and fiscal policies to spur the demand for goods and services. At the microeconomic level, governments can regulate banks and other financial institutions to keep them sound. They can also use tax policy to steer investment into more productive industries and trade policies to allow new industries to mature to the point at which they can survive foreign competition. And governments can use a variety of devices, ranging from job creation to manpower training to welfare assistance, to put unemployed labor back to work and cushion human hardship.\n\nStiglitz complains bitterly that the IMF has done great damage through the economic policies it has prescribed that countries must follow in order to qualify for IMF loans, or for loans from banks and other private-sector lenders that look to the IMF to indicate whether a borrower is creditworthy. The organization and its officials, he argues, have ignored the implications of incomplete information, inadequate markets, and unworkable institutions{{snd}} all of which are especially characteristic of newly developing countries. As a result, Stiglitz argues, the IMF has often called for policies that conform to textbook economics but do not make sense for the countries to which the IMF is recommending them. Stiglitz seeks to show that these policies have been disastrous for the countries that have followed them.\n\n===''The Roaring Nineties'' (2003)===\n''The Roaring Nineties'' is Stiglitz' analysis of the boom and bust of the 1990s. Presented from an insider's point of view, firstly as chair of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisors, and later as chief economist of the World Bank, it continues his argument on how misplaced faith in free-market ideology led to the global economic issues of today, with a perceptive focus on US policies.\n\n===''New Paradigm for Monetary Economics'' (2003)===\n{{Expand section|date=August 2019}}\n\n===''Fair Trade for All'' (2005)===\nIn ''Fair Trade for All'', authors Stiglitz and Andrew Charlton argue that it is important to make the trading world more development friendly.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Blandford | first1 = David | year = | title = review of ''Fair Trade for All'', by J.E.

Dr. Stiglitz argues that through tariffs, subsidies, an over-complex patent system and pollution, the world is being both economically and politically destabilised. Stiglitz argues that strong, transparent institutions are needed to address these problems. He shows how an examination of incomplete markets can make corrective government policies desirable.\n\nStiglitz is an exception to the general pro-globalisation view of professional economists, according to economist [[Martin Wolf]].<ref name=preface>\"Why Globalization Works\" (Yale University Press 2004) {{ISBN|978-0-300-10252-9}}, p. 8. Also Wolf criticizes World Bank heavily (pp. xiii\u2013xv).</ref> Stiglitz argues that economic opportunities are not widely enough available, that financial crises are too costly and too frequent, and that the rich countries have done too little to address these problems. ''Making Globalization Work''<ref>see {{YouTube|UzhD7KVs-R4|Stiglitz discuss his book}}</ref> has sold more than two million copies.\n\n===''Stability with Growth'' (2006)===\nIn ''[[Stability with Growth: Macroeconomics, Liberalization and Development]]'', Stiglitz, [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Ocampo]] (United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, until 2007), Shari Spiegel (Managing Director, Initiative for Policy Dialogue{{snd}} IPD), Ricardo Ffrench-Davis (Main Adviser, Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean{{snd}} [[ECLAC]]) and [[Deepak Nayyar]] (Vice Chancellor, University of Delhi) discuss the current debates on macroeconomics, capital market liberalization and development, and develop a new framework within which one can assess alternative policies. They explain their belief that the [[Washington Consensus]] has advocated narrow goals for development (with a focus on price stability) and prescribed too few policy instruments (emphasizing monetary and fiscal policies), and places unwarranted faith in the role of markets. The new framework focuses on real stability and long-term sustainable and equitable growth, offers a variety of non-standard ways to stabilize the economy and promote growth, and accepts that market imperfections necessitate government interventions. Policy-makers have pursued stabilization goals with little concern for growth consequences, while trying to increase growth through structural reforms focused on improving economic efficiency. Moreover, structural policies, such as capital market liberalization, have had major consequences for economic stability. This book challenges these policies by arguing that stabilization policy has important consequences for long-term growth and has often been implemented with adverse consequences. The first part of the book introduces the key questions and looks at the objectives of economic policy from different perspectives. The third part presents a similar analysis for capital market liberalization.\n\n===''The Three Trillion Dollar War'' (2008)===\n''[[The Three Trillion Dollar War]]'' (co-authored with [[Linda Bilmes]]) examines the full cost of the Iraq War, including many hidden costs. The book also discusses the extent to which these costs will be imposed for many years to come, paying special attention to the enormous expenditures that will be required to care for very large numbers of wounded veterans. Stiglitz was openly critical of George W. Bush at the time the book was released.<ref>{{cite news |first=Kevin|last=Perry |title=Joseph Stiglitz interview about ''The Three Trillion Dollar War'' |url=http://kevinegperry.com/2008/03/04/joseph-stiglitz-interview-the-3-trillion-war/ |publisher=[[The Beaver (newspaper)|The Beaver]] |date=March 4, 2008 |accessdate=September 29, 2010 | location=London}}</ref>\n\n===''Freefall'' (2010)===\n{{Main|Freefall: America, Free Markets, and the Sinking of the World Economy}}\n\nIn ''Freefall: America, Free Markets, and the Sinking of the World Economy'', Stiglitz discusses the causes of the 2008 recession/depression and goes on to propose reforms needed to avoid a repetition of a similar crisis, advocating government intervention and regulation in a number of areas. Among the policy-makers he criticises are George W. Bush, Larry Summers, and Barack Obama.<ref>{{cite news |first=Joel|last=Krupa |title=Guiding the Invisible Hand |url=http://www.oxonianreview.org/wp/guiding-the-invisible-hand/ |date=June 7, 2010 |accessdate=December 28, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===''The Price of Inequality'' (2012)===\nFrom the jacket: As those at the top continue to enjoy the best health care, education, and benefits of wealth, they often fail to realize that, as Joseph E. Stiglitz highlights, \"their fate is bound up with how the other 99 percent live ... It does not have to be this way.  In ''[[The Price of Inequality]]'' Stiglitz lays out a comprehensive agenda to create a more dynamic economy and fairer and more equal society\"\n\nThe book received the [[Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights]] 2013 Book Award, given annually to the book that \"most faithfully and forcefully reflects Robert Kennedy's purposes{{snd}} his concern for the poor and the powerless, his struggle for honest and even-handed justice, his conviction that a decent society must assure all young people a fair chance, and his faith that a free democracy can act to remedy disparities of power and opportunity.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Book Award |url=http://rfkcenter.org/book-award?lang=en |publisher=RFKcenter.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619072045/http://rfkcenter.org/book-award?lang=en |archivedate=2015-06-19 }}</ref>\n\n===''Creating a Learning Society: A New Approach to Growth, Development, and Social Progress'' (2014)===\nCreating a Learning Society, (co authored with Bruce C. Greenwald), cast light on the significance of this insight for economic theory and policy. Taking as a starting point Kenneth J. Arrow's 1962 paper \"Learning by Doing\", they explain why the production of knowledge differs from that of other goods and why market economies alone typically do not produce and transmit knowledge efficiently. Closing knowledge gaps and helping laggards learn are central to growth and development. But creating a learning society is equally crucial if we are to sustain improved living standards in advanced countries.\n\n===''The Great Divide: Unequal Societies and What We Can Do About Them'' (2015)===\nFrom the jacket: In ''The Great Divide'', Joseph E. Stiglitz expands on the diagnosis he offered in his best-selling book ''The Price of Inequality'' and suggests ways to counter America's growing problem. Stiglitz argues that inequality is a choice{{snd}} the cumulative result of unjust policies and misguided priorities.\n\n===''The Euro: How a Common Currency Threatens the Future of Europe'' (2016)===\n{{Expand section|date=August 2019}}\n\n===''People, Power and Profits: Progressive Capitalism for an Age of Discontent'' (2019)===\n{{Expand section|date=August 2019}}\n\n===''Measuring What Counts; The Global Movement for Well-Being'' (2019)===\nStiglitz and his coauthors point out that the interrelated crises of environmental degradation and human suffering of our current age demonstrate that \"something is fundamentally wrong with the way we assess economic performance and social progress.\" They argue that using GDP as the chief measure of our economic health does not provide an accurate assessment of the economy or the state of the world and the people living in it.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Queally |first1=Jon |title='Everything Is Not Fine': Nobel Economist Calls on Humanity to End Obsession With GDP |url=https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/11/25/everything-not-fine-nobel-economist-calls-humanity-end-obsession-gdp |website=Common Dreams |accessdate=10 December 2019 |date=25 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Stiglitz |first1=Joseph |title=It's time to retire metrics like GDP.

As the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers during the first term of the Clinton Administration and former chief economist at the [[World Bank]], Stiglitz was able to put some of his views into action. For example, he was an outspoken critic of quickly opening up financial markets in developing countries. These markets rely on access to good financial data and sound bankruptcy laws, but he argued that many of these countries didn't have the regulatory institutions needed to ensure that the markets would operate soundly.\n\n==Awards and honors==\nIn addition to being awarded the Nobel Memorial prize, Stiglitz has over 40 honorary doctorates and at least eight honorary professorships as well as an honorary deanship.<ref name=\"cv\">[http://www2.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty/jstiglitz/download/Stiglitz_CV.pdf Curriculum Vitae] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513134138/http://www2.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty/jstiglitz/download/Stiglitz_CV.pdf |date=2011-05-13 }}, Joseph E.

It is less popular in [[New South Wales]], the [[Australian Capital Territory]] and [[Queensland]], although there has traditionally been support for the code in regions within those states, such as parts of southern New South Wales including the [[Riverina]] and parts of Queensland such as [[Cairns]] and the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]]. The AFL teams from Brisbane and Sydney attracted a strong increase in crowds and television audiences when they won four premierships between them from 2001&ndash;2005 (and appeared in Grand Finals between 2001 and 2006 inclusive), though crowds and TV ratings have both declined as both teams' performances (in particular the [[Brisbane Lions]] who have suffered a decline since losing the [[2004 AFL Grand Final]]) in subsequent years dropped. Demographic and migration trends have affected all football codes in recent years, but most significantly Australian football in Queensland.\n\nIt is particularly popular amongst [[indigenous Australian]] communities. Indigenous Australians are well represented in professional AFL players: while only 2.4% of the population is of indigenous origin, 10% of AFL players identify themselves this way.\n\nAustralian rules is the national sport of [[Nauru]].\n\n===Attendance===\n{{see also|Australian rules football attendance records}}\n[[File:As-east.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A capacity crowd at an AFL game at [[AAMI Stadium]] in Adelaide.]]\nAustralian rules football is the most highly attended spectator sport in Australia: government figures show that more than 2.5 million people attended games in 2005-06.<ref>[http://www.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs@.nsf/e8ae5488b598839cca25682000131612/1f8fac9c2c7b1623ca2568a900139417!OpenDocument Sports Attendance], Australian Bureau of Statistics, January 2007.</ref> In 2007 (including finals matches), a cumulative 7,049,945 people attended [[Australian Football League]] premiership matches, a record for the competition.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/10/26/2071193.htm |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=2007-10-26|title=AFL to start over Easter weekend}}</ref> In 2005, a further 307,181 attended [[NAB Cup]] pre-season matches and 117,552 attended Regional Challenge pre-season practice matches around the country.\n\nAs of 2005 the AFL is one of only five professional sports leagues in the world with an average [[Sports attendance|attendance]] above thirty thousand (the others are the [[NFL]] in the United States and [[Major League Baseball]] in the U.S. and Canada, and the top division soccer leagues in [[Bundesliga (football)|Germany]] and [[Premier League|England]]). In 2007, the average attendance of 38,113 made the AFL the second best attended domestic club league in the world, after only the NFL in the United States.\n\nThe [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] is the largest stadium used for Australian rules football and the permanent home of the [[AFL Grand Final]].  It is one of the [[List of stadiums by capacity|largest sporting stadiums in the world]] and was the venue for the record Australian rules football attendance of 121,696 at the [[1970 VFL Grand Final]], between [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] and [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] - which game was also historic, in that it heralded the dawning of a new style of football - still largely in use today, wherein handballing was introduced more to commence the attack from the back line. Redevelopment since then to a mainly seated stadium has reduced the current capacity to approximately 100,000.\n\nIn addition to the national AFL competition, some semi-professional local leagues also draw significant crowds. Although crowds for state leagues have suffered in recent years, they continue to draw support, particularly for finals matches. The South Australian [[South Australian National Football League|SANFL]] drew an attendance of 309,874 in 2006 and the Western Australian [[West Australian Football League|WAFL]] drew an official attendance of 207,154. Other leagues, such as the Victorian [[Victorian Football League|VFL]] [[Northern Territory Football League]] and the popular country league [[Ovens & Murray Football League|Ovens & Murray]] also charge admission and draw notable crowds (but with no available attendance figures).\n\nOutside of Australia, the game has drawn notable attendances only for occasional carnival type events, such as International tests and [[Australian rules football exhibition matches|exhibition match]]es.\n\n===Television===\n[[File:Afl grand final.jpg|thumb|300px|Part of the [[2006 AFL Grand Final]] pre-match entertainment.

Guernseys are similar to [[basketball]] shirts, but of a more robust design and tight fit. In the early period of the game's development players often wore sleeveless lace-up tops which gradually disappeared between the 1960s and early 1980s. A few players choose to wear a long sleeved variation of the modern guernsey design. Players wore full length pants, before adopting shorts in the 1920s. Tight-fitting shorts were a notable fashion trend in most leagues in the 1980s and some players began to wear [[hamstring]] warmers. A brief experiment with [[lycra]] by the AFL in the State of Origin series was quickly abandoned for more traditional wear3. Long socks (football socks) are compulsory and boots with moulded cleats or studs for gripping the ground are worn (screw-ins have been banned from most leagues since the 1990s).  Some players wear [[headband]]s or [[hair tie]]s to keep the hair out of their faces when playing, though this is rare.  Players will sometimes wear arm bands around their mid [[biceps]] and [[triceps]], typically of [[electrical tape]], in honour or in memoriam of someone related to the player or their club who recently died.\n\nTraditionally, umpires have worn white and were sometimes referred to as \"white maggots\"<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,21638833-421,00.html Footy moots 'white maggot' ban] from news.com.au</ref> amongst supporters. AFL umpires now wear bright colours to also avoid clashes with the player guernseys and AFL goal umpires now wear t-shirts and caps, rather than the traditional white coat and [[Trilby|broad brimmed hat]] (similar to what was worn by many cricket umpires) which they wore before the 1990s.\n\n[[File:Richmond Cheer Squad Rd 21 2006 copy.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Cheersquads at Australian rules football matches behind the goals wave giant Pom-pons or floggers to signify a goal]]\n[[File:Four'N Twenty Pie at the AFL.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Meat pies are a tradition at Australian football games.]]\nTypical supporter wear includes the team [[scarf]] and sometimes [[Knit cap|beanie]] (particularly in cooler climates) in the colours of the team. Team guernseys are also worn by supporters.  Team flags are sometimes flown by supporters at the start of a game, when a goal is scored, and when their team wins.\n\n===Gameday and crowd===\nBefore AFL matches, it is traditional for teams to run through a [[cr\u00eape paper]] [[Banner (Australian rules football)|banner]] constructed by the cheersquads of each team.  These often feature messages and slogans for the team in the context of the match, such as congratulating a player on a landmark number of games and more recently also sponsorship messages.  The banners and sometimes also streamers are used in important local football matches such as finals. Some players are [[superstitious]] about running through the banner.  As players run through the banners, the team's club song is always played.  The winning clubs song is also played at the end of each match.\n\nAustralian rules supporters are said to \"barrack\" for their team.  Though other cultures have had an influence at various points in its history, Australian football tends to have different atmosphere to sports like soccer and American football.  Partly due to Australian culture, Australian rules spectators are generally more solitary animals. Despite loud shouting and arguing, crowd violence is rare.  With the exception of small official cheersquads, spectators at Aussie Rules matches will rarely engage in support for their teams with organised chants, and there is often no segregation between fans. Instead, each individual spectator will most often shout their own support using the nickname of their team i.e. \"Carn the Crows !\" or \"Carn the Maggies\", or after goals perform simple chants such as \"Ess-en-don! (clap-clap-clap)\" or \"Freo! Freo!\".  In contrast, cheersquads are highly organised, have their own rituals and almost always congregate behind the goals during games. The nature of the sport reflects this method of supporting. While some sports such as English or American football may involve lull periods where large chants reverberate around the ground, Australian rules football is played at a constant, frenetic pace, often leaving the crowd too immersed to take part in 'soccer style' chants.  Most professional clubs have official cheersquads which will sometimes wave enormous coloured [[Pompon|pompom]]s known as ''floggers'' after the umpire has signalled a goal.  American style [[cheerleading]] is very rare.<ref>Fanfare: Spectator culture and Australian Rules Football edited by Matthew Nicholson. ASSH Studies, 15. Melbourne: Australian Society for Sports History, 2005, pp. 140, A$25.00, paperback, {{ISBN|0-9757616-2-5}}</ref>\n\n[[Australian meat pie|Meat pies]], [[beer]] and [[chiko rolls]] are popular consumables (sometimes noted as a tradition) for supporters at Australian rules matches. At AFL matches mobile vendors walk around the ground selling such pies, yelling out the well-known call of \"hot pies, cold drinks!\"\n\nAt [[AAMI Stadium]] in [[Adelaide]]; it is tradition to have a barbecue outside the stadium, in the carpark. Many families will bring their barbecues with them. This is particularly popular during the Sunday afternoon matches.\n\nAt the end of the match, it is traditional for a ''[[pitch invasion]]'' to occur. Supporters run onto the field to celebrate the game and play games of [[kick-to-kick]] with their families. In many suburban and country games, this also happens during quarter and half-time breaks. In the AFL in recent years, this tradition has been more strictly controlled with [[security guards]] to ensure that players and officials can safely leave the ground. At the largest AFL grounds, this tradition has been banned completely, to protect the surface, much to the discontent of fans. But most smaller regional & interstate grounds ([[Simonds Stadium]] & [[Sydney Showground Stadium]], for example) still allow fans onto the field after the game. Sometimes a mid-game ''pitch invasion'' is expected for various highly anticipated landmark achievements (such as a player kicking a record number of goals).\n\nReading the [[AFL Record]] and recording the goals kicked by players alongside the team lists is also commonly done by spectators.\n\n==Injuries and prevention==\n{{Further|Australian rules football injuries}}\nAustralian rules football is known for its high level of physical body contact compared to other sports such as [[soccer]] and [[basketball]].  High impact collisions can occur from any direction.  Unlike [[gridiron football|gridiron]], padding is not mandatory and is rarely worn.  Combined with the range of activity including jumping, running, kicking, twisting and turning this means that injury rates are relatively high in comparison to other sports.\n\nSome ruckmen wear shin pads and thigh pads and players with head injuries sometimes wear soft helmets. Mouthguards are worn by most players but are only compulsory in some leagues.\n\n[[Soft tissue]] injuries are the most frequent, including injuries to the [[thigh]]s, [[hamstring]] and [[calf muscle]]s.  Pre-game warm-up and [[stretching]] exercises are a focus of the standard preparation routine for clubs at all levels to minimise these injuries.  [[Osteitis pubis]] is a condition which particularly affects Australian rules footballers.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/07/24/1058853197167.html Research finds cause of osteitis pubis]</ref>  Injuries to the knee, ankle and shoulders are also common.  Hospital treated injuries, particularly for broken bones, account for 40 percent of all Australian rules football injuries.<ref>[http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/BHCV2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Australian_rules_football_preventing_injury?open Australian rules football - preventing injury]</ref>\n\n[[Knee reconstruction]]s are among the most commonly incurred career threatening injuries for both professional and amateur players, although professional players frequently continue to play after rehabilitation.  Recently some professional players have undergone an innovative surgery that inserts a synthetic ligament in the knee which reduces the time out of football from twelve to three months.<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/perthnow/story/0,21598,23968725-5005401,00.html Luke Webster's radical knee surgery put to test in WAFL]</ref>\n\nPlayers can suffer [[head injury|head injuries]],<ref>[http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/314/7075/171 Retrospective study of concussive convulsions in elite Australian rules and rugby league footballers: phenomenology, aetiology, and outcome]</ref> however spinal injuries are extremely uncommon and comparatively much lower than [[rugby football]].<ref>[http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/182_11_060605/car10658_fm.html Spinal cord injuries in Australian footballers 1997\u20132002]</ref><ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/health/thepulse/s1388068.htm A neck breaking game]</ref>\n\nIn cases of injury, players are able to be treated whilst on the ground and umpires generally only stop the play when players are removed from the ground on a [[stretcher]].  Most leagues have implemented a [[blood rule]] which forces players with bleeding wounds to leave the field for treatment until the bleeding is stopped to prevent the transmission of [[blood-borne disease]].\n\nAustralian rules football does not have the range or severity of [[Health issues in American football|health issues of American football]] however players have been known to die whilst playing Aussie Rules, though the most common cause is [[heart failure]].  The Victorian State Coroner reported five sudden deaths in that state among Australian rules footballers aged under 38 years between 1990-1997. Three of these deaths were attributed to [[Ischaemic heart disease]] (mean age, 31.7 years), and the other two to [[physical trauma]].<ref>[http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/may3/young/young.html Sudden death due to ischaemic heart disease in young Aboriginal sportsmen in the Northern Territory, 1982-1996]</ref>\n\nIn a study conducted recently of retired VFL/AFL footballers found that the most common problems amongst the group in old age included [[arthritis]], [[hip replacement]]s and significantly reduced capacity to participate in athletic activity.<ref>[http://www.injuryupdate.com.au/issues/life_after_football.php Life After Football]</ref><ref>{{cite journal| pmid=9066547 | volume=166 | title=Osteoarthritis of the knee in retired, elite Australian Rules footballers | year=1997 | journal=Med J Aust | pages=187\u201390 | last1 = Deacon | first1 = A | last2 = Bennell | first2 = K | last3 = Kiss | first3 = ZS | last4 = Crossley | first4 = K | last5 = Brukner | first5 = P}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years the AFL has commissioned official studies as well as introduced new rules and precautions aimed at reducing the number and severity of injuries in the sport,<ref>[http://www.afl.com.au/Portals/0/afl_docs/injury07.pdf AFL Injury Report]</ref> and there are variation games which significantly reduce the contact and risk of injury to players and allow players of any age to continue to participate.\n\n==Women==\n{{main|Women's Australian rules football}}\n[[File:Women's marking contest mark.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A [[Women's Australian rules football]] Match between the [[Melbourne University Mugars]] and the [[Darebin Falcons]].]]\n   \nWomen have been involved in Australian football since its inception, with many early match reports remarking on the equal representation of both sexes in the crowds.<ref>Daffey, Paul (2 May 2004).

The play was adapted as a film, directed by [[Bruce Beresford]] and starring [[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]] and [[Graham Kennedy]], in 1980.\n\nMany songs inspired by the game have become popular, none more so than the 1979 hit \"[[Up There Cazaly]]\", by [[Mike Brady (musician)|Mike Brady]]. Brady followed the hit up with \"[[One Day in September (song)|One Day in September]]\" in 1987. Both are frequently used in Grand Final celebrations.\n\n==AFL players and the media==\nFootballers' off-field behaviour is as highly scrutinised as their on-field behaviour.  Footballers are held by many in Australia to be [[role model]]s.\n\n==Betting==\n\n\"Footy tipping\" is the term for [[office pool]]s where players nominate which teams will win that week. It is part of the staple office environment in Australia.\n\nTraditionally [[office pool]]s are done with footy tipping posters, however with the modern age these private competitions can be managed by PC or mobile apps.\n\nBetting on the AFL is very popular.\n\n==Violence==\n\n===Player violence===\nOn-field [[assault]] has historically been socially tolerated in Australia, but, in recent years, this has changed with some players being charged by police for their on-field actions, including a recent jailing in Victoria<ref>[http://news.smh.com.au/national/footballer-jailed-for-onfield-assault-20080703-312s.html Footballer jailed for on-field assault]</ref> and the much publicized case involving VFL player [[Leigh Matthews]] which ended the public perception that on-field football assaults are somehow legal.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/09/15/1031608345061.html Memories are made of this]</ref>  League penalties for such actions have also generally increased in recent years<ref>[http://www.realfooty.com.au/news/news/even-in-battle-players-must-aim-higher/2008/07/05/1214951115549.html Even in battle, players must aim higher]</ref> and overall violence has decreased over time.<ref>[http://www.aic.gov.au/conferences/ncv2/warren.pdf Violence in Sport: Some Theoretical and Practical Issues in the Australian Context] from the Australian Institute of Criminology</ref>\n\nViolence has also affected the [[International Rules Series]], with the Irish team objecting to the level of violence tolerated by Australia.\n\n===Supporter violence===\n{{Further|List of violent spectator incidents in sports}}\n\n==Multiculturalism==\n{{further|List of overseas-born AFL players}}\n{{further|List of VFL/AFL players by ethnicity}}\nAustralian rules football has involved a diverse section of society and the AFL has multicultural programs to engage people from different backgrounds.\n\n==Racial vilification==\n{{further|Racism in sport in Australia}}\nThe [[Australian Football League]]'s [[racial vilification]] code is an effort to stamp out racism in the sport and it has worked well, however there has been a history of well publicised incidents in the sport.\n\n;1993\n* [[Nicky Winmar]] reacted to overt racism from the crowd at [[Victoria Park, Melbourne]], turning to face the offending segments of the crowd, lifted his Guernsey and defiantly pointed to his skin (at the end of a game between [[St Kilda Football Club]] and [[Collingwood Football Club]]).

Indigenous Australians are well represented in professional AFL players: while only 2.4% of the population is of indigenous origin, 10% of AFL players identify themselves this way.\n\nAustralian rules is the national sport of [[Nauru]].\n\n===Attendance===\n{{see also|Australian rules football attendance records}}\n[[File:As-east.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A capacity crowd at an AFL game at [[AAMI Stadium]] in Adelaide.]]\nAustralian rules football is the most highly attended spectator sport in Australia: government figures show that more than 2.5 million people attended games in 2005-06.<ref>[http://www.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs@.nsf/e8ae5488b598839cca25682000131612/1f8fac9c2c7b1623ca2568a900139417!OpenDocument Sports Attendance], Australian Bureau of Statistics, January 2007.</ref> In 2007 (including finals matches), a cumulative 7,049,945 people attended [[Australian Football League]] premiership matches, a record for the competition.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/10/26/2071193.htm |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=2007-10-26|title=AFL to start over Easter weekend}}</ref> In 2005, a further 307,181 attended [[NAB Cup]] pre-season matches and 117,552 attended Regional Challenge pre-season practice matches around the country.\n\nAs of 2005 the AFL is one of only five professional sports leagues in the world with an average [[Sports attendance|attendance]] above thirty thousand (the others are the [[NFL]] in the United States and [[Major League Baseball]] in the U.S. and Canada, and the top division soccer leagues in [[Bundesliga (football)|Germany]] and [[Premier League|England]]). In 2007, the average attendance of 38,113 made the AFL the second best attended domestic club league in the world, after only the NFL in the United States.\n\nThe [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] is the largest stadium used for Australian rules football and the permanent home of the [[AFL Grand Final]].  It is one of the [[List of stadiums by capacity|largest sporting stadiums in the world]] and was the venue for the record Australian rules football attendance of 121,696 at the [[1970 VFL Grand Final]], between [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] and [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] - which game was also historic, in that it heralded the dawning of a new style of football - still largely in use today, wherein handballing was introduced more to commence the attack from the back line. Redevelopment since then to a mainly seated stadium has reduced the current capacity to approximately 100,000.\n\nIn addition to the national AFL competition, some semi-professional local leagues also draw significant crowds. Although crowds for state leagues have suffered in recent years, they continue to draw support, particularly for finals matches. The South Australian [[South Australian National Football League|SANFL]] drew an attendance of 309,874 in 2006 and the Western Australian [[West Australian Football League|WAFL]] drew an official attendance of 207,154. Other leagues, such as the Victorian [[Victorian Football League|VFL]] [[Northern Territory Football League]] and the popular country league [[Ovens & Murray Football League|Ovens & Murray]] also charge admission and draw notable crowds (but with no available attendance figures).\n\nOutside of Australia, the game has drawn notable attendances only for occasional carnival type events, such as International tests and [[Australian rules football exhibition matches|exhibition match]]es.\n\n===Television===\n[[File:Afl grand final.jpg|thumb|300px|Part of the [[2006 AFL Grand Final]] pre-match entertainment.  The AFL Grand Final is one of the most watched sporting events on television in Australia.]]\n\nThe national AFL is the main league which is shown on television in Australia.\n\nThe 2005 [[AFL Grand Final]] was watched by a record [[television]] audience of more than 3.3 million people across Australia's five most populous cities&mdash;the [[Australian capital cities|five mainland state capitals]]&mdash;including 1.2 million in [[Melbourne]] and 991,000 in [[Sydney]].<ref>[http://www.oztam.com.au/documents/2005/E_20050918.pdf Top 20 Programs - Ranking Report (E)] 18\u201324 September, OzTam.</ref> In 2006, the national audience was 3.145 million, including 1.182 million in Melbourne and 759,000 in Sydney.<ref>[http://www.oztam.com.au/documents%5C2006%5CE_20060924.pdf Top 20 Programs - Ranking Report (E) 24 September - 30 September 2006]</ref>\n\nAccording to [[OzTAM]], in recent years, the AFL Grand Final has reached the top five programs across the five biggest cities in [[List of Australian television ratings for 2002|2002]], [[List of Australian television ratings for 2003|2003]], [[List of Australian television ratings for 2004|2004]], [[List of Australian television ratings for 2005|2005]] and [[List of Australian television ratings for 2006|2006]]. In [[List of Australian television ratings for 2007|2007]], it was #1 in metropolitan markets.  Australian rules football has achieved a #1 rating in the sports category in both [[List of Australian television ratings for 2004|2004]] and [[List of Australian television ratings for 2005|2005]].\n\nSome of the more popular regional leagues in Australia have the \"match of the week\" televised locally and free-to-air on [[ABC Television (Australia)|ABC Television]]'s respective state networks.  The SANFL is the most popular of these regional competitions measuring a total of 1,415,000 television viewers in 2007.<ref>[http://www.sanfl.com.au/news/sanfl_news/147/ SANFL Website<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nSome of these regional leagues also attracted a national audience through free-to-air broadcasting on television networks such as [[ABC2]]. OzTAM began measuring these audiences in 2006.  Despite a large number of complaints, ABC2 withdrew all of these broadcasts in early 2008.<ref>[http://www.aboriginalfootball.com.au/feb08.html ABC 'blackout' on Tiwi footy]</ref><ref>[http://www.aboriginalfootball.com.au/feb08.html ABC responds to tidal wave of protest]</ref> However in 2010 the ABC began replaying these matches nationwide, online via the new ABC iView catch-up TV service.

Since 2005, some AFL matches have been shown in the pacific rim region for the first time through the [[Australia Network]]. The AFL Grand Final is broadcast to many countries and attracts many million viewers worldwide. This audience has grown to approximately 30 million viewers from 72 countries.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2007/09/22/1189881828861.html Grand final's free kick to economy a tough call]</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Roy Morgan Research]], more Americans watch Australian Rules Football than Australians. A poll taken between April 2002 and March 2004 showed that 7,496,000 North Americans compared to 7,004,000 Australians watch Australian Rules Football at least occasionally on television.<ref>[http://www.roymorgan.com/resources/pdf/papers/20041201.pdf Globalisation of Sport Report 2005] from roymorgan.com (Roy Morgan Single Source USA March 2003-Feb2004)</ref>\n\n===New media===\n{{see also|List of Australian rules football computer games}}\nThe AFL website was the #1 most popular [[Hitwise]] Australian sports website in 2004, increasing in market share by 9.86% over that year.<ref>[http://www.hitwise.co.uk/press-center/hitwiseHS2004/asiapac-awards-022805.php Most Popular Australian websites for 2004 revealed] from Hitwise</ref>  In 2006, other consistently high traffic websites in the Australian Top 20 included AFL Dream Team, (Trading Post) AFL Footy Tipping, BigFooty.com and Bomberland.<ref>[http://www.hitwise.com/news/au200604.html Fast Mover - Kellogg's Nutri-Grain Dream Team]</ref>  In 2006, the search term 'afl' represented the highest number of search terms (2.48%) that delivered users to Hitwise sports category listed websites.<ref>[http://www.hitwise.com/news/au200607.html Search Terms - Industry Search Term Report for Sports]</ref> Statistics show that Victorians consist of 43% of all visits to the AFL football category.<ref>[http://weblogs.hitwise.com/sandra-hanchard/2006/09/victorians_still_afls_biggest.html Victorians Still AFL's Biggest Fans Online]</ref>\n\n==Team rivalries==\n{{further|AFL team rivalries}}\nRivalries are one of the main drivers in generating passionate supporter bases.  \nIn almost every league, there is a team which everyone loves to hate, like Collingwood, Port Adelaide and even the Southport Sharks.\nThe AFL in particular encourages the building of such rivalries, as a method of increasing publicity for the league, to the point of designating one round each year as ''Rivalry Round'' where many of these match-ups are held on the one weekend.<ref name=\"ABC\">Lonergan, Dan; [http://www.abc.net.au/sport/columns/200704/s1896078.htm?afl  AFL arch rivals - a thing of the past]; 2007-04-13</ref>  Whilst some rivalries, such as between teams from adjacent areas are still strong, the designation of an entire round of fixtures as Rivalry Round is often criticised due to some arbitrary matchups, or ignoring stronger, more recent rivalries.<ref name=\"baum\">Baum, G;[http://www.realfooty.com.au/news/news/footys-drowning-in-a-sea-of-medals/2008/04/11/1207856837505.html Footy's drowning in a sea of medals]; The Age; 2008-04-12</ref>\n\n==Traditions of the game==\n[[File:Fremantle dockers.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Before the start of each AFL games, players run through a banner constructed by supporters.]]\n\n===Clothing===\nAs part of their uniform, players wear shirts called [[Guernsey (clothing)|guernsey]]s, often referred to colloquially as ''''jumpers'''.  Guernseys are similar to [[basketball]] shirts, but of a more robust design and tight fit. In the early period of the game's development players often wore sleeveless lace-up tops which gradually disappeared between the 1960s and early 1980s. A few players choose to wear a long sleeved variation of the modern guernsey design. Players wore full length pants, before adopting shorts in the 1920s. Tight-fitting shorts were a notable fashion trend in most leagues in the 1980s and some players began to wear [[hamstring]] warmers. A brief experiment with [[lycra]] by the AFL in the State of Origin series was quickly abandoned for more traditional wear3. Long socks (football socks) are compulsory and boots with moulded cleats or studs for gripping the ground are worn (screw-ins have been banned from most leagues since the 1990s).  Some players wear [[headband]]s or [[hair tie]]s to keep the hair out of their faces when playing, though this is rare.  Players will sometimes wear arm bands around their mid [[biceps]] and [[triceps]], typically of [[electrical tape]], in honour or in memoriam of someone related to the player or their club who recently died.\n\nTraditionally, umpires have worn white and were sometimes referred to as \"white maggots\"<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,21638833-421,00.html Footy moots 'white maggot' ban] from news.com.au</ref> amongst supporters. AFL umpires now wear bright colours to also avoid clashes with the player guernseys and AFL goal umpires now wear t-shirts and caps, rather than the traditional white coat and [[Trilby|broad brimmed hat]] (similar to what was worn by many cricket umpires) which they wore before the 1990s.\n\n[[File:Richmond Cheer Squad Rd 21 2006 copy.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Cheersquads at Australian rules football matches behind the goals wave giant Pom-pons or floggers to signify a goal]]\n[[File:Four'N Twenty Pie at the AFL.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Meat pies are a tradition at Australian football games.]]\nTypical supporter wear includes the team [[scarf]] and sometimes [[Knit cap|beanie]] (particularly in cooler climates) in the colours of the team. Team guernseys are also worn by supporters.  Team flags are sometimes flown by supporters at the start of a game, when a goal is scored, and when their team wins.\n\n===Gameday and crowd===\nBefore AFL matches, it is traditional for teams to run through a [[cr\u00eape paper]] [[Banner (Australian rules football)|banner]] constructed by the cheersquads of each team.  These often feature messages and slogans for the team in the context of the match, such as congratulating a player on a landmark number of games and more recently also sponsorship messages.  The banners and sometimes also streamers are used in important local football matches such as finals. Some players are [[superstitious]] about running through the banner.  As players run through the banners, the team's club song is always played.  The winning clubs song is also played at the end of each match.\n\nAustralian rules supporters are said to \"barrack\" for their team.  Though other cultures have had an influence at various points in its history, Australian football tends to have different atmosphere to sports like soccer and American football.  Partly due to Australian culture, Australian rules spectators are generally more solitary animals. Despite loud shouting and arguing, crowd violence is rare.  With the exception of small official cheersquads, spectators at Aussie Rules matches will rarely engage in support for their teams with organised chants, and there is often no segregation between fans. Instead, each individual spectator will most often shout their own support using the nickname of their team i.e. \"Carn the Crows !\" or \"Carn the Maggies\", or after goals perform simple chants such as \"Ess-en-don! (clap-clap-clap)\" or \"Freo! Freo!\".  In contrast, cheersquads are highly organised, have their own rituals and almost always congregate behind the goals during games. The nature of the sport reflects this method of supporting. While some sports such as English or American football may involve lull periods where large chants reverberate around the ground, Australian rules football is played at a constant, frenetic pace, often leaving the crowd too immersed to take part in 'soccer style' chants.  Most professional clubs have official cheersquads which will sometimes wave enormous coloured [[Pompon|pompom]]s known as ''floggers'' after the umpire has signalled a goal.  American style [[cheerleading]] is very rare.<ref>Fanfare: Spectator culture and Australian Rules Football edited by Matthew Nicholson. ASSH Studies, 15. Melbourne: Australian Society for Sports History, 2005, pp. 140, A$25.00, paperback, {{ISBN|0-9757616-2-5}}</ref>\n\n[[Australian meat pie|Meat pies]], [[beer]] and [[chiko rolls]] are popular consumables (sometimes noted as a tradition) for supporters at Australian rules matches. At AFL matches mobile vendors walk around the ground selling such pies, yelling out the well-known call of \"hot pies, cold drinks!\"\n\nAt [[AAMI Stadium]] in [[Adelaide]]; it is tradition to have a barbecue outside the stadium, in the carpark. Many families will bring their barbecues with them. This is particularly popular during the Sunday afternoon matches.\n\nAt the end of the match, it is traditional for a ''[[pitch invasion]]'' to occur. Supporters run onto the field to celebrate the game and play games of [[kick-to-kick]] with their families. In many suburban and country games, this also happens during quarter and half-time breaks. In the AFL in recent years, this tradition has been more strictly controlled with [[security guards]] to ensure that players and officials can safely leave the ground. At the largest AFL grounds, this tradition has been banned completely, to protect the surface, much to the discontent of fans. But most smaller regional & interstate grounds ([[Simonds Stadium]] & [[Sydney Showground Stadium]], for example) still allow fans onto the field after the game. Sometimes a mid-game ''pitch invasion'' is expected for various highly anticipated landmark achievements (such as a player kicking a record number of goals).\n\nReading the [[AFL Record]] and recording the goals kicked by players alongside the team lists is also commonly done by spectators.\n\n==Injuries and prevention==\n{{Further|Australian rules football injuries}}\nAustralian rules football is known for its high level of physical body contact compared to other sports such as [[soccer]] and [[basketball]].  High impact collisions can occur from any direction.  Unlike [[gridiron football|gridiron]], padding is not mandatory and is rarely worn.  Combined with the range of activity including jumping, running, kicking, twisting and turning this means that injury rates are relatively high in comparison to other sports.\n\nSome ruckmen wear shin pads and thigh pads and players with head injuries sometimes wear soft helmets. Mouthguards are worn by most players but are only compulsory in some leagues.\n\n[[Soft tissue]] injuries are the most frequent, including injuries to the [[thigh]]s, [[hamstring]] and [[calf muscle]]s.  Pre-game warm-up and [[stretching]] exercises are a focus of the standard preparation routine for clubs at all levels to minimise these injuries.  [[Osteitis pubis]] is a condition which particularly affects Australian rules footballers.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/07/24/1058853197167.html Research finds cause of osteitis pubis]</ref>  Injuries to the knee, ankle and shoulders are also common.  Hospital treated injuries, particularly for broken bones, account for 40 percent of all Australian rules football injuries.<ref>[http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/BHCV2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Australian_rules_football_preventing_injury?open Australian rules football - preventing injury]</ref>\n\n[[Knee reconstruction]]s are among the most commonly incurred career threatening injuries for both professional and amateur players, although professional players frequently continue to play after rehabilitation.  Recently some professional players have undergone an innovative surgery that inserts a synthetic ligament in the knee which reduces the time out of football from twelve to three months.<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/perthnow/story/0,21598,23968725-5005401,00.html Luke Webster's radical knee surgery put to test in WAFL]</ref>\n\nPlayers can suffer [[head injury|head injuries]],<ref>[http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/314/7075/171 Retrospective study of concussive convulsions in elite Australian rules and rugby league footballers: phenomenology, aetiology, and outcome]</ref> however spinal injuries are extremely uncommon and comparatively much lower than [[rugby football]].<ref>[http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/182_11_060605/car10658_fm.html Spinal cord injuries in Australian footballers 1997\u20132002]</ref><ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/health/thepulse/s1388068.htm A neck breaking game]</ref>\n\nIn cases of injury, players are able to be treated whilst on the ground and umpires generally only stop the play when players are removed from the ground on a [[stretcher]].  Most leagues have implemented a [[blood rule]] which forces players with bleeding wounds to leave the field for treatment until the bleeding is stopped to prevent the transmission of [[blood-borne disease]].\n\nAustralian rules football does not have the range or severity of [[Health issues in American football|health issues of American football]] however players have been known to die whilst playing Aussie Rules, though the most common cause is [[heart failure]].  The Victorian State Coroner reported five sudden deaths in that state among Australian rules footballers aged under 38 years between 1990-1997. Three of these deaths were attributed to [[Ischaemic heart disease]] (mean age, 31.7 years), and the other two to [[physical trauma]].<ref>[http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/may3/young/young.html Sudden death due to ischaemic heart disease in young Aboriginal sportsmen in the Northern Territory, 1982-1996]</ref>\n\nIn a study conducted recently of retired VFL/AFL footballers found that the most common problems amongst the group in old age included [[arthritis]], [[hip replacement]]s and significantly reduced capacity to participate in athletic activity.<ref>[http://www.injuryupdate.com.au/issues/life_after_football.php Life After Football]</ref><ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9066547?dopt=Abstract Osteoarthritis of the knee in retired, elite Australian Rules footballers]</ref>\n\nIn recent years the AFL has commissioned official studies as well as introduced new rules and precautions aimed at reducing the number and severity of injuries in the sport,<ref>[http://www.afl.com.au/Portals/0/afl_docs/injury07.pdf AFL Injury Report]</ref> and there are variation games which significantly reduce the contact and risk of injury to players and allow players of any age to continue to participate.\n\n==Women==\n{{main|Women's Australian rules football}}\n[[File:Women's marking contest mark.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A [[Women's Australian rules football]] Match between the [[Melbourne University Mugars]] and the [[Darebin Falcons]].]]\n   \nWomen have been involved in Australian football since its inception, with many early match reports remarking on the equal representation of both sexes in the crowds.<ref>Daffey, Paul (2 May 2004).

The play was adapted as a film, directed by [[Bruce Beresford]] and starring [[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]] and [[Graham Kennedy]], in 1980.\n\nMany songs inspired by the game have become popular, none more so than the 1979 hit \"[[Up There Cazaly]]\", by [[Mike Brady (musician)|Mike Brady]]. Brady followed the hit up with \"[[One Day in September (song)|One Day in September]]\" in 1987. Both are frequently used in Grand Final celebrations.\n\n==AFL players and the media==\nFootballers' off-field behaviour is as highly scrutinised as their on-field behaviour.  Footballers are held by many in Australia to be [[role model]]s.\n\n==Betting==\n\n\"Footy tipping\" is the term for [[office pool]]s where players nominate which teams will win that week. It is part of the staple office environment in Australia.\n\nTraditionally [[office pool]]s are done with footy tipping posters, however with the modern age these private competitions can be managed by PC or mobile apps.\n\nBetting on the AFL is very popular.\n\n==Violence==\n\n===Player violence===\nOn-field [[assault]] has historically been socially tolerated in Australia, but, in recent years, this has changed with some players being charged by police for their on-field actions, including a recent jailing in Victoria<ref>[http://news.smh.com.au/national/footballer-jailed-for-onfield-assault-20080703-312s.html Footballer jailed for on-field assault]</ref> and the much publicized case involving VFL player [[Leigh Matthews]] which ended the public perception that on-field football assaults are somehow legal.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/09/15/1031608345061.html Memories are made of this]</ref>  League penalties for such actions have also generally increased in recent years<ref>[http://www.realfooty.com.au/news/news/even-in-battle-players-must-aim-higher/2008/07/05/1214951115549.html Even in battle, players must aim higher]</ref> and overall violence has decreased over time.<ref>[http://www.aic.gov.au/conferences/ncv2/warren.pdf Violence in Sport: Some Theoretical and Practical Issues in the Australian Context] from the Australian Institute of Criminology</ref>\n\nViolence has also affected the [[International Rules Series]], with the Irish team objecting to the level of violence tolerated by Australia.\n\n===Supporter violence===\n{{Further|List of violent spectator incidents in sports}}\n\n==Multiculturalism==\n{{further|List of overseas-born AFL players}}\n{{further|List of VFL/AFL players by ethnicity}}\nAustralian rules football has involved a diverse section of society and the AFL has multicultural programs to engage people from different backgrounds.\n\n==Racial vilification==\n{{further|Racism in sport in Australia}}\nThe [[Australian Football League]]'s [[racial vilification]] code is an effort to stamp out racism in the sport and it has worked well, however there has been a history of well publicised incidents in the sport.\n\n;1993\n* [[Nicky Winmar]] reacted to overt racism from the crowd at [[Victoria Park, Melbourne]], turning to face the offending segments of the crowd, lifted his Guernsey and defiantly pointed to his skin (at the end of a game between [[St Kilda Football Club]] and [[Collingwood Football Club]]).
