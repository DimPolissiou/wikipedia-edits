Fur colouring, in particular the facial mask, bears some similarity to [[raccoon]]s and a number of [[civet]]s. Behavior also: Raccoon dogs are nocturnal, yet adjust their daily schedule and habits in response to local availability of food, similar to [[viverrids]], [[ferret]]s, [[weasel]]s, raccoons, and [[red panda]]s, to which raccoon dogs are not closely related.<ref>{{cite book |last=Zeveloff |first=S.I. |year=2002 |title=Raccoons: a natural history |chapter=10 |publisher=UBC Press}}</ref>\n\n==Ecology==\n===Diet===\nRaccoon dogs are [[omnivore]]s that feed on [[insect]]s, [[rodent]]s, [[amphibian]]s, [[bird]]s, [[fish]], [[reptile]]s, [[mollusks]], [[carrion]], and [[insectivore]]s, as well as fruits, nuts, and berries.<ref>Sutor, A., Kauhala, K., & Ansorge, H.

[[Frog]]s are the most commonly taken amphibians; in the [[Voronezh]] region, they frequently eat [[fire-bellied toad]]s, while [[European spadefoot toad]]s are usually taken in Ukraine. Raccoon dogs are able to eat toads that have toxic skin secretions by producing copious amounts of saliva to dilute the toxins.<ref>Alderton, David. (1998). ''Foxes, Wolves, and Wild Dogs of the World'', p. 119. London: Blandford.</ref> They prey on [[waterfowl]], [[passerine]]s, and [[migrating bird]]s. [[Grouse]] are commonly hunted in their introduced range, and many instances of [[pheasant]] predation are recorded in the [[Ussuri]] territory.\n\nRaccoon dogs eat beached fish and fish trapped in small water bodies. They rarely catch fish during the spawning season, but eat many during the spring thaw. In their southern range, they eat young [[tortoise]]s and their eggs. Insectivorous mammals hunted by raccoon dogs include [[shrew]]s and [[hedgehog]]s, and on rare occasions, [[mole (animal)|mole]]s and [[desman]]s. In the Ussuri territory, [[large mole]]s are their primary source of food. Plant food is highly variable, and includes [[bulb]]s, [[rhizome]]s, [[oat]]s, [[millet]]s, [[maize]], [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s, [[fruit]]s, [[berries]], [[grape]]s, [[melon]]s, [[watermelon]]s, [[pumpkin]]s, and [[tomato]]es.<ref name=\"soviet\"/> In Japan, they have been observed to climb trees to forage for fruits and berries,<ref name=canids /><ref name=\"Ikeda, Hiroshi p40,44\"/> using their curved claws to climb.<ref name=\"waza.org\"/>\n\nRaccoon dogs adapt their diets to the season; in late autumn and winter, they feed mostly on rodents, carrion, and feces, while fruit, insects, and amphibians predominate in spring. In summer, they eat fewer rodents, and mainly target nesting birds and fruits, grains, and vegetables.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\n===Predators===\n[[Wolf|Wolves]] are the main predators of raccoon dogs, killing large numbers of them in spring and summer, though attacks have been reported in autumn, too. In [[Tatarstan]], wolf predation can account for 55.6% of raccoon dog deaths, while in northwestern Russia, it amounts to 64%. [[Red fox]]es kill raccoon dog pups, and have been known to bite adults to death.\n\nBoth foxes and [[Eurasian badger]]s compete with raccoon dogs for food, and have been known to kill them if raccoon dogs enter their burrows. [[Eurasian lynx]]es rarely attack them. [[Birds of prey]] known to take raccoon dogs include [[golden eagle]]s, [[white-tailed eagle]]s, [[Accipitridae|goshawk]]s, and [[eagle owl]]s.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\n==Behavior==\n===Reproduction and development===\nThe [[mating season]] begins from early February to late April, depending on location. Raccoon dogs are [[monogamy|monogamous]] animals, with pair formations usually occurring in autumn. Captive males, however, have been known to mate with four or five females. Males will fight briefly, but not fatally, for mates.<ref name=\"soviet\"/> Copulation occurs during the night or dawn and typically will last 6\u20139 minutes.<ref>Valtonen, Maija H., E. J. Rajakoski, and J. I. M\u00e4kel\u00e4. \"[http://www.reproduction-online.org/content/51/2/517.full.pdf Reproductive features in the female raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides)].\" Journal of Reproduction and Fertility 51.2 (1977): 517-NP.</ref> [[Estrus]] lasts from a few hours to six days, during which females may mate up to five times. Females enter estrus again after 20\u201324&nbsp;days, even when pregnant.\n\nThe [[gestation period]] lasts 61\u201370&nbsp;days, with pups being born in April\u2013May. Litter sizes typically consist of 6&ndash;8&nbsp;pups, though 15\u201316&nbsp;pups can be born in exceptional cases. First-time mothers typically give birth to fewer pups than older ones. Males take an active role in raising the pups.<ref name=\"soviet\"/> This male role is very significant, as demonstrated by early releases in 1928 of pregnant females without males, resulting in very limited success at introduction, while later releases of pairs from 1929 until the 1960s resulted in the raccoon dog's now-extensive introduced European range.<ref>Alderton, David. Foxes, Wolves, and Wild Dogs of the World. London: Blandford, 1998. p121.</ref>\n\n[[File:Streifzug Marderhundwelpe Pforzheim.JPG|thumb|left|Raccoon dog pup]]\n\nAt birth, pups weigh 60\u2013110&nbsp;g, and are blind and covered in short, dense, soft wool lacking [[guard hairs]]. Their eyes open after 9\u201310&nbsp;days, with the teeth erupting after 14\u201316&nbsp;days. Guard hairs begin to grow after 10&nbsp;days, and first appear on the hips and shoulders. After two weeks, they lighten in colour, with black tones remaining only around the eyes. [[Lactation]] lasts for 45\u201360&nbsp;days, though pups begin eating food brought to them as early as the age of three weeks to one month. They reach their full size at the age of 4.5&nbsp;months. Pups leave their parents in late August\u2013September. By October, the pups, which by then resemble adults, unite in pairs. [[Sexual maturity]] is reached at 8\u201310&nbsp;months. Their [[longevity]] is largely unknown; animals 6\u20137&nbsp;years of age have been encountered in the wild, while captive specimens have been known to live for 11 years.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\n===Hibernation===\nRaccoon dogs are the only canids known to [[hibernation|hibernate]]. In early winter, they increase their subcutaneous fat by 18\u201323% and their internal fat by 3\u20135%. Animals failing to reach these fat levels usually do not survive the winter. During their hibernation, their metabolism decreases by 25%. In areas such as [[Primorsky Krai]] and their introduced range, raccoon dogs hibernate only during severe snowstorms. In December, their physical activity decreases once snow depth reaches 15\u201320&nbsp;cm, and limit the range from their burrows to no more than 150\u2013200 m. Their daily activities increase during February when the females become receptive and when food is more available.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\n===Vocalizations===\nLike foxes, they do not bark, uttering instead a growl, followed by a long-drawn, melancholy whine. Captive specimens have been known to utter daily a very different kind of sound when hungry, described as a sort of mewing plaint.<ref name=\"smith\">{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/naturalhistoryof139smit |format=PDF|title=''The natural history of dogs : canidae or genus canis of authors ; including also the genera hyaena and proteles'' |date=1839|author1=Charles Hamilton Smith  |author2=William Jardine |lastauthoramp=yes |location=Edinburgh|publisher=W.H.

[[Primorsky Krai|Primor'e]] in the [[Russian Far East]] was the first region to be colonised, with individuals being transplanted from islands in the [[Sea of Japan]]. By 1934, raccoon dogs were introduced into [[Altai Krai|Altai]], the northern [[Caucasus]], [[Armenia]], [[Kirgizia]], [[Tatarstan]], [[Tver Oblast|Kalinin]], [[Penza Oblast|Penza]], and [[Orenburg Oblast|Orenburg]] regions. In the following year, they were further introduced into [[Leningradsky District, Krasnodar Krai|Leningradsky]], [[Murmansk Oblast|Murmansk]], [[Novosibirsk Oblast|Novosibirsk]], and [[Bashkortostan]].\n\nRaccoon dogs in [[Irkutsk Oblast|Irkutsk]], Novosibirsk, [[Zabaykalsky Krai|Trans-Baikaliya]], and [[Altai Krai|Altai]] did not fare well, due to harsh winters and scarce food. Raccoon dogs also fared badly in the mountainous regions of the Caucasus, [[Central Asia]], and Moldova. However, successful introductions occurred in the [[Baltic States|Baltic states]], European Russia (particularly in [[Tver Oblast|Kalinin]], [[Novgorod Oblast|Novgorod]], [[Pskov Oblast|Pskov]], and [[Smolensk Oblast|Smolensk]] regions), in central Russia ([[Moscow Oblast|Moscow]], [[Yaroslavl Oblast|Yaroslavl]], [[Vologda Oblast|Vologda]], [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast|Gorkiy]], [[Vladimir Oblast|Vladimir]], [[Ryazan Oblast|Ryazan]] Oblasts, etc.) as well as in the [[Chernozem|black soil]] belt ([[Voronezh Oblast|Voronezh]], [[Tambov Oblast|Tambov]] and [[Kursk Oblast|Kursk]]), the lower [[Volga Region]] and the level parts of the northern Caucasus and [[Dagestan]].

Birds amount to 15\u201320% of their diets in Lithuania, 46% on the [[Oka River]] floodlands, and 48.6% in the Voronezh Reserve.

In Ukraine, raccoon dogs are harmful to [[kitchen garden]]s, [[melon]] cultivations, [[vineyard]]s, and [[corn]] seedlings.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\n===Hunting===\nRaccoon dogs are typically hunted from November until the snow deepens. In the [[Far East]], they are hunted at night using [[Laika (dog breed)|Laika]]s and mongrels. In the 19th&nbsp;century, the [[Goldi]] and [[Oroch people]] fastened bells to the collars of their raccoon dog hounds. In their introduced range, raccoon dogs are usually caught incidentally during hunts for other species. [[Fox hunting|Hunting with dogs]] is the most efficient method in raccoon dog hunts, having success rates of 80\u201390%, as opposed to 8\u201310% with guns and 5\u20137% with traps. Unless they retreat in their burrows, hunted raccoon dogs can be quickly strangled by hunting dogs. Traps are usually set at their burrows, along the shores of water bodies, and around marshes and ponds.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\nIn Finland, 60,000\u201370,000 raccoon dogs were hunted in 2000, increasing to 170,000 in 2009 and 164,000 in 2010. Hunting of raccoon dogs in Hungary began in 1997, with an annual catch of one to nine animals. In Poland, 6,200 were shot in 2002\u20132003. Annual Swedish and Danish raccoon dog hunts usually result in the capture of two to seven individuals. Between 18,000 and 70,000&nbsp;Japanese raccoon dogs were killed in Japan from the post-WWII period to 1982. Japan intensified its raccoon dog culling starting in the 1970s, averaging 4,529&nbsp;kills annually between 1990 and 1998. The numbers killed have since decreased.<ref name=canids />\n\n===Fur use===\n[[File:Raccoon_dog_12.jpg|right|thumb|A caged raccoon dog]]\n[[File:Chinese raccoon fur skins.jpg|right|thumb|Chinese raccoon dog pelts on sale in [[Milan]], Italy]]\n\nWhen used on clothing, the fur of the raccoon dog is called \"murmansky\" fur.

Small raccoon dog pelts with silky fur command higher prices than large, coarse-furred ones. Due to their long and coarse guard hairs and their woolly fur fibre, which has a tendency to felt or mat, raccoon dog pelts are used almost exclusively for fur trimmings. Japanese raccoon dog pelts, though smaller than other geographic variants, are the most valued variety, with specimens from [[Amur Oblast|Amur]] and [[Heilongjiang]] coming close behind, while Korean and southern Chinese are the least valued.<ref name=\"fur\">Bachrach, Max.

The world trade of raccoon dog pelts during 1907\u20131910 amounted to 260,000\u2013300,000, of which an estimated 20,000 (5\u20138%) came from Russia, though more recent figures estimate a lesser number of 5,000\u20136,000; 12,000 raccoon dogs were caught in the 1930s. In their introduced range, licensed trade of raccoon dogs began in 1948\u20131950, with restrictions being removed in 1953\u20131955.\n\nAfter the trade began, the number of catches increased sharply; from 1953\u20131961, it fluctuated between 30,000 and 70,000. In the latter year, about 10,000 were taken from their natural range in the Far East, while 56,000 were taken in their introduced range. Of the 56,000, 6,500 came from Belarus, 5,000 in Ukraine, 4,000 each for Latvia, Lithuania, and [[Krasnodar]], 3,700 in Kalinin, 2,700 in Pskov, and 2,300 in Astrakhan, while 1,000\u20132,000 pelts each were produced in Vologod, Moscow, Leningrad, [[Novogrod]], Smolensk, [[Yaroslavl]], Azerbaijan, Estonia, and [[Dagestan]]. Fewer than 1,000 pelts were produced in all remaining republics and districts. Successful raccoon dog introductions in Kalinin resulted in animals with denser and softer fur: The length of guard and top hairs increased by 7.96%, that of the underfur increased by 5.3%. The thickness of the guard and top hairs decreased by 3.41%. The density of the fur increased by 11.3%. They also became darker in colour, with black-brown pelts occurring in 8% of specimens, as opposed to 3% in their homeland.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\nCaptive breeding of raccoon dogs was initiated in 1928 in the [[Far East]], with 15&nbsp;state farms keeping them in 1934. Raccoon dogs were the principal furbearers farmed during the early years of collective farms, particularly in Ukraine. By the 1940s, this practice lessened in popularity, as the raccoon dogs required almost the same types of food as [[Silver fox (animal)|silver fox]]es, which were more valuable.<ref name=\"soviet\"/> An investigation by three animal protection groups into the Chinese fur trade in 2004 and part of 2005 asserts approximately 1.5&nbsp;million raccoon dogs are raised for fur in China.<ref>Hsieh-Yi, Yi-Chiao, Yu Fu, Mark Rissi and Dr Barbara Maas [http://www.careforthewild.com/files/Furreport05.pdf Fun Fur?

Fur colouring, in particular the facial mask, bears some similarity to [[raccoon]]s and a number of [[civet]]s. Behavior also: Raccoon dogs are nocturnal, yet adjust their daily schedule and habits in response to local availability of food, similar to [[viverrids]], [[ferret]]s, [[weasel]]s, raccoons, and [[red panda]]s, to which raccoon dogs are not closely related.<ref>{{cite book |last=Zeveloff |first=S.I. |year=2002 |title=Raccoons: a natural history |chapter=10 |publisher=UBC Press}}</ref>\n\n==Ecology==\n===Diet===\nRaccoon dogs are [[omnivore]]s that feed on [[insect]]s, [[rodent]]s, [[amphibian]]s, [[bird]]s, [[fish]], [[reptile]]s, [[mollusks]], [[carrion]], and [[insectivore]]s, as well as fruits, nuts, and berries.<ref>Sutor, A., Kauhala, K., & Ansorge, H.

[[Frog]]s are the most commonly taken amphibians; in the [[Voronezh]] region, they frequently eat [[fire-bellied toad]]s, while [[European spadefoot toad]]s are usually taken in Ukraine. Raccoon dogs are able to eat toads that have toxic skin secretions by producing copious amounts of saliva to dilute the toxins.<ref>Alderton, David. (1998). ''Foxes, Wolves, and Wild Dogs of the World'', p. 119. London: Blandford.</ref> They prey on [[waterfowl]], [[passerine]]s, and [[migrating bird]]s. [[Grouse]] are commonly hunted in their introduced range, and many instances of [[pheasant]] predation are recorded in the [[Ussuri]] territory.\n\nRaccoon dogs eat beached fish and fish trapped in small water bodies. They rarely catch fish during the spawning season, but eat many during the spring thaw. In their southern range, they eat young [[tortoise]]s and their eggs. Insectivorous mammals hunted by raccoon dogs include [[shrew]]s and [[hedgehog]]s, and on rare occasions, [[mole (animal)|mole]]s and [[desman]]s. In the Ussuri territory, [[large mole]]s are their primary source of food. Plant food is highly variable, and includes [[bulb]]s, [[rhizome]]s, [[oat]]s, [[millet]]s, [[maize]], [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s, [[fruit]]s, [[berries]], [[grape]]s, [[melon]]s, [[watermelon]]s, [[pumpkin]]s, and [[tomato]]es.<ref name=\"soviet\"/> In Japan, they have been observed to climb trees to forage for fruits and berries,<ref name=canids /><ref name=\"Ikeda, Hiroshi p40,44\"/> using their curved claws to climb.<ref name=\"waza.org\"/>\n\nRaccoon dogs adapt their diets to the season; in late autumn and winter, they feed mostly on rodents, carrion, and feces, while fruit, insects, and amphibians predominate in spring. In summer, they eat fewer rodents, and mainly target nesting birds and fruits, grains, and vegetables.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\n===Predators===\n[[Wolf|Wolves]] are the main predators of raccoon dogs, killing large numbers of them in spring and summer, though attacks have been reported in autumn, too. In [[Tatarstan]], wolf predation can account for 55.6% of raccoon dog deaths, while in northwestern Russia, it amounts to 64%. [[Red fox]]es kill raccoon dog pups, and have been known to bite adults to death.\n\nBoth foxes and [[Eurasian badger]]s compete with raccoon dogs for food, and have been known to kill them if raccoon dogs enter their burrows. [[Eurasian lynx]]es rarely attack them. [[Birds of prey]] known to take raccoon dogs include [[golden eagle]]s, [[white-tailed eagle]]s, [[Accipitridae|goshawk]]s, and [[eagle owl]]s.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\n==Behavior==\n===Reproduction and development===\nThe [[mating season]] begins from early February to late April, depending on location. Raccoon dogs are [[monogamy|monogamous]] animals, with pair formations usually occurring in autumn. Captive males, however, have been known to mate with four or five females. Males will fight briefly, but not fatally, for mates.<ref name=\"soviet\"/> Copulation occurs during the night or dawn and typically will last 6\u20139 minutes.<ref>Valtonen, Maija H., E. J. Rajakoski, and J. I. M\u00e4kel\u00e4. \"[http://www.reproduction-online.org/content/51/2/517.full.pdf Reproductive features in the female raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides)].\" Journal of Reproduction and Fertility 51.2 (1977): 517-NP.</ref> [[Estrus]] lasts from a few hours to six days, during which females may mate up to five times. Females enter estrus again after 20\u201324&nbsp;days, even when pregnant.\n\nThe [[gestation period]] lasts 61\u201370&nbsp;days, with pups being born in April\u2013May. Litter sizes typically consist of 6&ndash;8&nbsp;pups, though 15\u201316&nbsp;pups can be born in exceptional cases. First-time mothers typically give birth to fewer pups than older ones. Males take an active role in raising the pups.<ref name=\"soviet\"/> This male role is very significant, as demonstrated by early releases in 1928 of pregnant females without males, resulting in very limited success at introduction, while later releases of pairs from 1929 until the 1960s resulted in the raccoon dog's now-extensive introduced European range.<ref>Alderton, David. Foxes, Wolves, and Wild Dogs of the World. London: Blandford, 1998. p121.</ref>\n\n[[File:Streifzug Marderhundwelpe Pforzheim.JPG|thumb|left|Raccoon dog pup]]\n\nAt birth, pups weigh 60\u2013110&nbsp;g, and are blind and covered in short, dense, soft wool lacking [[guard hairs]]. Their eyes open after 9\u201310&nbsp;days, with the teeth erupting after 14\u201316&nbsp;days. Guard hairs begin to grow after 10&nbsp;days, and first appear on the hips and shoulders. After two weeks, they lighten in colour, with black tones remaining only around the eyes. [[Lactation]] lasts for 45\u201360&nbsp;days, though pups begin eating food brought to them as early as the age of three weeks to one month. They reach their full size at the age of 4.5&nbsp;months. Pups leave their parents in late August\u2013September. By October, the pups, which by then resemble adults, unite in pairs. [[Sexual maturity]] is reached at 8\u201310&nbsp;months. Their [[longevity]] is largely unknown; animals 6\u20137&nbsp;years of age have been encountered in the wild, while captive specimens have been known to live for 11 years.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\n===Hibernation===\nRaccoon dogs are the only canids known to [[hibernation|hibernate]]. In early winter, they increase their subcutaneous fat by 18\u201323% and their internal fat by 3\u20135%. Animals failing to reach these fat levels usually do not survive the winter. During their hibernation, their metabolism decreases by 25%. In areas such as [[Primorsky Krai]] and their introduced range, raccoon dogs hibernate only during severe snowstorms. In December, their physical activity decreases once snow depth reaches 15\u201320&nbsp;cm, and limit the range from their burrows to no more than 150\u2013200 m. Their daily activities increase during February when the females become receptive and when food is more available.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\n===Vocalizations===\nLike foxes, they do not bark, uttering instead a growl, followed by a long-drawn, melancholy whine. Captive specimens have been known to utter daily a very different kind of sound when hungry, described as a sort of mewing plaint.<ref name=\"smith\">{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/naturalhistoryof139smit |format=PDF|title=''The natural history of dogs : canidae or genus canis of authors ; including also the genera hyaena and proteles'' |date=1839|author1=Charles Hamilton Smith  |author2=William Jardine |lastauthoramp=yes |location=Edinburgh|publisher=W.H.

[[Primorsky Krai|Primor'e]] in the [[Russian Far East]] was the first region to be colonised, with individuals being transplanted from islands in the [[Sea of Japan]]. By 1934, raccoon dogs were introduced into [[Altai Krai|Altai]], the northern [[Caucasus]], [[Armenia]], [[Kirgizia]], [[Tatarstan]], [[Tver Oblast|Kalinin]], [[Penza Oblast|Penza]], and [[Orenburg Oblast|Orenburg]] regions. In the following year, they were further introduced into [[Leningradsky District, Krasnodar Krai|Leningradsky]], [[Murmansk Oblast|Murmansk]], [[Novosibirsk Oblast|Novosibirsk]], and [[Bashkortostan]].\n\nRaccoon dogs in [[Irkutsk Oblast|Irkutsk]], Novosibirsk, [[Zabaykalsky Krai|Trans-Baikaliya]], and [[Altai Krai|Altai]] did not fare well, due to harsh winters and scarce food. Raccoon dogs also fared badly in the mountainous regions of the Caucasus, [[Central Asia]], and Moldova. However, successful introductions occurred in the [[Baltic States|Baltic states]], European Russia (particularly in [[Tver Oblast|Kalinin]], [[Novgorod Oblast|Novgorod]], [[Pskov Oblast|Pskov]], and [[Smolensk Oblast|Smolensk]] regions), in central Russia ([[Moscow Oblast|Moscow]], [[Yaroslavl Oblast|Yaroslavl]], [[Vologda Oblast|Vologda]], [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast|Gorkiy]], [[Vladimir Oblast|Vladimir]], [[Ryazan Oblast|Ryazan]] Oblasts, etc.) as well as in the [[Chernozem|black soil]] belt ([[Voronezh Oblast|Voronezh]], [[Tambov Oblast|Tambov]] and [[Kursk Oblast|Kursk]]), the lower [[Volga Region]] and the level parts of the northern Caucasus and [[Dagestan]]. In Ukraine, the greatest numbers of raccoon dogs were established in [[Poltava Oblast|Poltava]], [[Kherson Oblast|Kherson]], and [[Luhansk Oblast|Lugansk]].<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\nIn 1948, 35&nbsp;raccoon dogs were introduced into Latvia.

However genetic analysis has since convinced most experts that bats are the natural hosts.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Paules |first1=Catherine I. |last2=Marston |first2=Hillary D. |last3=Fauci |first3=Anthony S. |title=Coronavirus Infections -- More than Just the Common Cold |journal=JAMA |volume=323 |issue=8 |date=January 23, 2020 |doi=10.1001/jama.2020.0757 |pmid=31971553 |doi-access=free }}</ref> Racoon dogs were most likely only transient accidental [[Host (biology)|hosts]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chan |first1=P.K. |last2=Chan |first2=M.C. |title=Tracing the SARS-coronavirus |journal=J Thorac Dis |volume=5 Suppl 2 |pages=S118-21 |date=August 5, 2013 |doi=10.3978/j.issn.2072-1439.2013.06.19 |pmid=23977431 |pmc=3747522 }}</ref>\n\n==Relationships with humans==\n\n===Game and crop damage===\nRaccoon dogs are harmful to [[game bird]] populations, particularly in [[floodplain|floodland]]s and the shorelines of [[estuaries]], where they feed almost exclusively on eggs and chicks during the spring period. Birds amount to 15\u201320% of their diets in Lithuania, 46% on the [[Oka River]] floodlands, and 48.6% in the Voronezh Reserve. They are also harmful to the [[muskrat]] trade, destroying their nests and eating their young. In Ukraine, raccoon dogs are harmful to [[kitchen garden]]s, [[melon]] cultivations, [[vineyard]]s, and [[corn]] seedlings.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\n===Hunting===\nRaccoon dogs are typically hunted from November until the snow deepens. In the [[Far East]], they are hunted at night using [[Laika (dog breed)|Laika]]s and mongrels. In the 19th&nbsp;century, the [[Goldi]] and [[Oroch people]] fastened bells to the collars of their raccoon dog hounds. In their introduced range, raccoon dogs are usually caught incidentally during hunts for other species. [[Fox hunting|Hunting with dogs]] is the most efficient method in raccoon dog hunts, having success rates of 80\u201390%, as opposed to 8\u201310% with guns and 5\u20137% with traps. Unless they retreat in their burrows, hunted raccoon dogs can be quickly strangled by hunting dogs. Traps are usually set at their burrows, along the shores of water bodies, and around marshes and ponds.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\nIn Finland, 60,000\u201370,000 raccoon dogs were hunted in 2000, increasing to 170,000 in 2009 and 164,000 in 2010. Hunting of raccoon dogs in Hungary began in 1997, with an annual catch of one to nine animals. In Poland, 6,200 were shot in 2002\u20132003. Annual Swedish and Danish raccoon dog hunts usually result in the capture of two to seven individuals. Between 18,000 and 70,000&nbsp;Japanese raccoon dogs were killed in Japan from the post-WWII period to 1982. Japan intensified its raccoon dog culling starting in the 1970s, averaging 4,529&nbsp;kills annually between 1990 and 1998. The numbers killed have since decreased.<ref name=canids />\n\n===Fur use===\n[[File:Raccoon_dog_12.jpg|right|thumb|A caged raccoon dog]]\n[[File:Chinese raccoon fur skins.jpg|right|thumb|Chinese raccoon dog pelts on sale in [[Milan]], Italy]]\n\nWhen used on clothing, the fur of the raccoon dog is called \"murmansky\" fur. In the United States, it is marketed as \"Asiatic raccoon\", and in Northern Europe as \"Finn raccoon\".<ref name=furtypes>{{cite web|url=http://www.furcommission.com/farming/mink-biology/furtypes/|title=Fur Types in Brief|work=Furcommission.com|accessdate=2015-04-09}}</ref> Generally, the quality of the pelt is based on the silkiness of the fur, as its physical appeal depends upon the guard hairs being erect, which is only possible in silkier furs. Small raccoon dog pelts with silky fur command higher prices than large, coarse-furred ones. Due to their long and coarse guard hairs and their woolly fur fibre, which has a tendency to felt or mat, raccoon dog pelts are used almost exclusively for fur trimmings. Japanese raccoon dog pelts, though smaller than other geographic variants, are the most valued variety, with specimens from [[Amur Oblast|Amur]] and [[Heilongjiang]] coming close behind, while Korean and southern Chinese are the least valued.<ref name=\"fur\">Bachrach, Max. (1953). ''Fur: a practical treatise'', 3rd ed. New York: Prentice-Hall.</ref> When raised in captivity, raccoon dogs can produce 100&nbsp;g of wool of slightly lesser quality than that of [[goat]]s.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\nIn the Japanese islands, the natives employed raccoon dog skin to make bellows, to decorate their drums, and for winter headgear.<ref name=\"smith\"/> Russian trade in raccoon dogs was quite developed in the Primorye and Ussuri areas in the 1880s. The world trade of raccoon dog pelts during 1907\u20131910 amounted to 260,000\u2013300,000, of which an estimated 20,000 (5\u20138%) came from Russia, though more recent figures estimate a lesser number of 5,000\u20136,000; 12,000 raccoon dogs were caught in the 1930s. In their introduced range, licensed trade of raccoon dogs began in 1948\u20131950, with restrictions being removed in 1953\u20131955.\n\nAfter the trade began, the number of catches increased sharply; from 1953\u20131961, it fluctuated between 30,000 and 70,000. In the latter year, about 10,000 were taken from their natural range in the Far East, while 56,000 were taken in their introduced range. Of the 56,000, 6,500 came from Belarus, 5,000 in Ukraine, 4,000 each for Latvia, Lithuania, and [[Krasnodar]], 3,700 in Kalinin, 2,700 in Pskov, and 2,300 in Astrakhan, while 1,000\u20132,000 pelts each were produced in Vologod, Moscow, Leningrad, [[Novogrod]], Smolensk, [[Yaroslavl]], Azerbaijan, Estonia, and [[Dagestan]]. Fewer than 1,000 pelts were produced in all remaining republics and districts. Successful raccoon dog introductions in Kalinin resulted in animals with denser and softer fur: The length of guard and top hairs increased by 7.96%, that of the underfur increased by 5.3%. The thickness of the guard and top hairs decreased by 3.41%. The density of the fur increased by 11.3%. They also became darker in colour, with black-brown pelts occurring in 8% of specimens, as opposed to 3% in their homeland.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\nCaptive breeding of raccoon dogs was initiated in 1928 in the [[Far East]], with 15&nbsp;state farms keeping them in 1934. Raccoon dogs were the principal furbearers farmed during the early years of collective farms, particularly in Ukraine. By the 1940s, this practice lessened in popularity, as the raccoon dogs required almost the same types of food as [[Silver fox (animal)|silver fox]]es, which were more valuable.<ref name=\"soviet\"/> An investigation by three animal protection groups into the Chinese fur trade in 2004 and part of 2005 asserts approximately 1.5&nbsp;million raccoon dogs are raised for fur in China.<ref>Hsieh-Yi, Yi-Chiao, Yu Fu, Mark Rissi and Dr Barbara Maas [http://www.careforthewild.com/files/Furreport05.pdf Fun Fur?

The Chinese official death toll is usually of the order of few casualties, whereas some estimates place the number of people dead to a few hundred (see [[Intelsat 708]]).\n\nThe participation of [[Space Systems/Loral]] in the accident investigation caused great political controversy in the United States since the information provided during the accident investigation would help China improve its rockets and ballistic missiles.

The satellite was able to make up the performance shortfall using its own engine and reach geosynchronous orbit, but with its lifetime shortened to 10.5 years from the originally projected 15-16 years. The investigation found that the failure was due to burn-through of the engine's gas generator, and that \"the most likely cause of the burn-through was a foreign matter or humidity-caused icing in the engine's liquid-hydrogen injectors\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=de Selding|first1=Peter B.|title=Burn-through Blamed in China Long March Mishap|url=http://spacenews.com/burn-through-blamed-china-long-march-mishap/|publisher=SpaceNews|date=19 November 2009 |accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== ChinaSat-9A partial launch failure ===\nOn 19 June 2017, a Long March 3B/E mission carrying [[ChinaSat_9A|ChinaSat-9A]] ended in partial failure.

The failure in the rocket's third stage left the payload in a lower than intended orbit, and the payload was forced to spend two weeks reaching its intended orbit under its own power.<ref>http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Chinese_satellite_Zhongxing_9A_enters_preset_orbit_999.html</ref>\n\n=== Palapa-N1 (Nusantara Dua) launch failure ===\nOn 9 April 2020, a Long March 3B launcher failed after lifting off from the [[Xichang Satellite Launch Center]] in the southwestern [[Sichuan]] province at 11:46 UTC during the launch of an Indonesian communications satellite, [[Nusantara Satu|Palapa-N1 (Nusantara Dua)]] of a mass of 5500 kg and was expected to enter service in geostationary orbit at 113\u00b0 East, replacing the [[Palapa-D]] satellite. But one of the two [[YF-75]] third stage engines appeared failed to ignite, preventing the Palapa-N1 (Nusantara Dua) satellite to reach orbit.<ref>https://kumparan.com/kumparantech/satelit-nusantara-dua-gagal-mengorbit-siaran-tv-dan-radio-terancam-bermasalah-1tCCDi3iDLY</ref> Wreckage from the third stage and the Palapa-N1 spacecraft re-entered the atmosphere, leading to sightings of fiery debris in the skies over Guam. With the Long March 3B failure, Chinese rockets have faltered on two missions in less than a month. A [[Long_March_7#CZ-7A_variant|Long March 7A]] rocket failed to place a satellite in orbit on 16 March 2020 after taking off from the [[Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site]] on [[Hainan Island]], located

Long March 3B with [[Intelsat 708]] failed just after liftoff when the launch vehicle veered off course and exploded when it hit the ground at T+23 seconds. One person on the ground was killed by the explosion (the total number of casualties is unknown). The cause of the accident was traced to short-circuiting of the vehicle's guidance platform at liftoff.<ref name=\"cnn1999\">{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/resources/1999/coxreport/satellite/pg1.html|title=Satellite Launches in the PRC: Loral|work=CNN|accessdate= 8 August 2018|date=25 May 1999}}</ref> The number of casualties is debated and unclear even decades after the accident. The Chinese official death toll is usually of the order of few casualties, whereas some estimates place the number of people dead to a few hundred (see [[Intelsat 708]]).\n\nThe participation of [[Space Systems/Loral]] in the accident investigation caused great political controversy in the United States since the information provided during the accident investigation would help China improve its rockets and ballistic missiles. The U.S. Congress reclassified satellite technology as a [[Ammunition|munition]] and placed it back under the restrictive [[International Traffic in Arms Regulations]] in 1998.<ref name=\"zenio2006\">{{cite news|last1=Zelnio|first1=Ryan|title=A short history of export control policy|url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/528/1|work=The Space Review |date=January 9, 2006}}</ref> No license to launch U.S. spacecraft on Chinese rockets has been approved by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] since then, and an official at the [[Bureau of Industry and Security]] emphasized in 2016 that \"no U.S.-origin content, regardless of significance, regardless of whether it's incorporated into a foreign-made item, can go to China\".<ref name=\"selding2016\">{{cite news|last1=de Selding|first1=Peter B.|title=U.S. ITAR satellite export regime's effects still strong in Europe|url=http://spacenews.com/u-s-itar-satellite-export-regimes-effects-still-strong-in-europe/|work=SpaceNews|date=April 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Palapa-D partial launch failure ===\nOn 31 August 2009, during the launch of [[Palapa-D]], the third stage engine under-performed and placed the satellite into a lower than planned orbit. The satellite was able to make up the performance shortfall using its own engine and reach geosynchronous orbit, but with its lifetime shortened to 10.5 years from the originally projected 15-16 years. The investigation found that the failure was due to burn-through of the engine's gas generator, and that \"the most likely cause of the burn-through was a foreign matter or humidity-caused icing in the engine's liquid-hydrogen injectors\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=de Selding|first1=Peter B.|title=Burn-through Blamed in China Long March Mishap|url=http://spacenews.com/burn-through-blamed-china-long-march-mishap/|publisher=SpaceNews|date=19 November 2009 |accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== ChinaSat-9A partial launch failure ===\nOn 19 June 2017, a Long March 3B/E mission carrying [[ChinaSat_9A|ChinaSat-9A]] ended in partial failure. Officials did not release details regarding the status of the mission for at least 4 hours after liftoff.<ref>http://spaceflight101.com/long-march-3b-zhongxing-9a-launch/</ref> Two weeks later, on 7 July 2017, officials confirmed that the mission had been anomalous, with Space Daily reporting that \"an anomaly was found on the carrier rocket's rolling control thruster, part of the attitude control engine, during the third gliding phase\". The failure in the rocket's third stage left the payload in a lower than intended orbit, and the payload was forced to spend two weeks reaching its intended orbit under its own power.<ref>http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Chinese_satellite_Zhongxing_9A_enters_preset_orbit_999.html</ref>\n\n=== Palapa-N1 (Nusantara Dua) launch failure ===\nOn 9 April 2020, a Long March 3B launcher failed after lifting off from the [[Xichang Satellite Launch Center]] in the southwestern [[Sichuan]] province at 11:46 UTC during the launch of an Indonesian communications satellite, [[Nusantara Satu|Palapa-N1 (Nusantara Dua)]] of a mass of 5500 kg and was expected to enter service in geostationary orbit at 113\u00b0 East, replacing the [[Palapa-D]] satellite. But one of the two [[YF-75]] third stage engines appeared failed to ignite, preventing the Palapa-N1 (Nusantara Dua) satellite to reach orbit.<ref>https://kumparan.com/kumparantech/satelit-nusantara-dua-gagal-mengorbit-siaran-tv-dan-radio-terancam-bermasalah-1tCCDi3iDLY</ref> Wreckage from the third stage and the Palapa-N1 spacecraft re-entered the atmosphere, leading to sightings of fiery debris in the skies over Guam.

On 28 March 2020, he suffered severe symptoms of nausea and was admitted to Kyaukme Township Hospital as a monitored patient. His analytical sample was tested and found positive.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://facebook.com/MinistryOfHealthAndSportsMyanmar/posts/3288465921182690|title=COVID-19 \u101b\u1031\u102c\u1002\u102b \u1005\u1031\u102c\u1004\u1037\u103a\u1000\u103c\u1015\u103a\u1000\u103c\u100a\u1037\u103a\u101b\u103e\u102f\u1019\u103e\u102f\u1014\u103e\u1004\u1037\u103a\u1015\u1010\u103a\u101e\u1000\u103a\u104d \u101e\u1010\u1004\u103a\u1038\u1011\u102f\u1010\u103a\u1015\u103c\u1014\u103a\u1001\u103c\u1004\u103a\u1038 (30-3-2020, 07:30 PM)|website=[[Ministry of Health and Sports (Myanmar)]]|date=30 March 2020|accessdate=30 March 2020|language=my}}</ref>\n\nOn 31 March, Ministry of Health and Sports confirmed one more case in Yangon.

Hanley Sch.JPG|thumb|left|Slocum's childhood school, now the [[Mount Hanley Schoolhouse Museum]]]]\nJoshua Slocum was born in the family's farm house in [[Mount Hanley, Nova Scotia|Mount Hanley]] and learned to read and write at the nearby [[Mount Hanley Schoolhouse Museum|Mount Hanley School]]. His earliest ventures on the water were made on coastal schooners operating out of the small ports such as Port George and Cottage Cove near Mount Hanley along the [[Bay of Fundy]].\n\nWhen Joshua was eight years old, the Slocombe family moved from Mount Hanley to [[Brier Island]] in [[Digby County]], at the mouth of the Bay of Fundy. Slocum's maternal grandfather was the keeper of the [[lighthouse]] at Southwest Point there. His father, a stern man and strict disciplinarian, took up making leather boots for the local fishermen, and Joshua helped in the shop. However, the boy found the scent of salt air much more alluring than the smell of shoe leather. He yearned for a life of adventure at sea, away from his demanding father and his increasingly chaotic life at home among so many brothers and sisters.\n\nHe made several attempts to run away from home, finally succeeding, at age fourteen, by hiring on as a [[cabin boy]] and cook on a fishing [[schooner]], but he soon returned home. In 1860, after the birth of the eleventh Slocombe (Joshua changed the spelling of his last name later in his life)<ref name=\"GeoffreyWolff\">Geoffrey Wolff, ''The Hard Way Around: The Passages of Joshua Slocum'')</ref> child and the subsequent death of his kindly mother, Joshua, then sixteen, left home for good. He and a friend signed on at [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] as ordinary seamen on a merchant ship bound for [[Dublin]], Ireland.\n\n==Early life at sea==\nFrom Dublin, he crossed to [[Liverpool]] to become an ordinary seaman on the British [[merchant ship]] ''Tangier'' (also recorded as ''Tanjore''), bound for China. During two years as a seaman, he rounded [[Cape Horn]] twice, landed at [[Jakarta|Batavia]] (now Jakarta) in the [[Dutch East Indies]], and visited the [[Maluku Islands]], [[Manila]], Hong Kong, [[Saigon]], Singapore, and San Francisco. While at sea, he studied for the [[Board of Trade]] examination, and, at the age of eighteen, he received his certificate as a fully qualified [[Second Mate]]. Slocum quickly rose through the ranks to become a [[Chief Mate]] on British ships transporting coal and grain between the British Isles and San Francisco.\n\nIn 1865, he settled in San Francisco, became an American citizen, and, after a period of [[salmon]] fishing and [[fur trading]] in the [[Oregon Territory]] of the northwest, he returned to the sea to pilot a schooner in the coastal trade between San Francisco and [[Seattle]]. His first blue-water command, in 1869, was the [[barque]] ''Washington'', which he took across the Pacific, from San Francisco to Australia, and home via [[Alaska]].\n\nHe sailed for thirteen years out of the port of San Francisco, transporting mixed cargo to China, Australia, the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]], and Japan. Between 1869 and 1889, he was the master of eight vessels, the first four of which (the ''Washington'', the ''Constitution'', the ''Benjamin Aymar'' and the ''Amethyst'') he commanded in the employ of others. Later, there would be four others that he himself owned, in whole or in part.\n\n==Family at sea==\nShortly before Christmas 1870, Slocum and the ''Washington'' put in at Sydney. There, in about a month's time, he met, courted, and married a young woman named Virginia Albertina Walker. Their marriage took place on January 31, 1871. Miss Walker, quite coincidentally, was an American whose New York family had migrated west to California at the time of the [[California gold rush|1849 gold rush]] and eventually continued on, by ship, to settle in Australia. She sailed with Slocum, and, over the next thirteen years, the couple had seven children, all born at sea or foreign ports. Four children, sons Victor, Benjamin Aymar, and James Garfield, and daughter Jessie, survived to adulthood.\n\nIn Alaska, the ''Washington'' was [[shipwreck|wrecked]] when she dragged her anchor during a gale, ran ashore, and broke up. Slocum, however, at considerable risk to himself, managed to save his wife, the crew, and much of the cargo, bringing all back to port safely in the ship's open boats. The owners of the shipping company that had employed Slocum were so impressed by this feat of ingenuity and leadership, they gave him the command of the ''Constitution'' which he sailed to Hawaii and the west coast of [[Mexico]].\n\nHis next command was the ''Benjamin Aymar'', a merchant vessel in the [[Pacific Ocean|South Seas]] trade. However, the owner, strapped for cash, sold the vessel out from under Slocum, and he and Virginia found themselves stranded in the [[Philippines]] without a ship.\n\n=== The ''Pato'' ===\nWhile in the Philippines, in 1874, under a commission from a British architect, Slocum organized native workers to build a 150-ton [[Steamboat|steamer]] in the shipyard at [[Subic Bay]]. In partial payment for the work, he was given the ninety-ton schooner, ''Pato'' (Spanish for \"Duck\"), the first ship he could call his own.\n\nOwnership of the ''Pato'' afforded Slocum the kind of freedom and autonomy he had never experienced before. Hiring a crew, he contracted to deliver a cargo to [[Vancouver]] in British Columbia. Thereafter, he used the ''Pato'' as a general freight carrier along the west coast of North America and in voyages back and forth between San Francisco and Hawaii. During this period, Slocum also fulfilled a long-held ambition to become a writer; he became a temporary correspondent for the ''San Francisco Bee''.\n\nThe Slocums sold the ''Pato'' in Honolulu in the spring of 1878. Returning to San Francisco, they purchased the ''Amethyst.'' He worked this ship until June 23, 1881.<ref>Geoffrey Wolff, ''The Hard Way Around: The Passages of Joshua Slocum, pgs. 70\u201375''</ref>\n \nThe Slocums next bought a third share in the ''Northern Light 2''. This large clipper was 233 feet in length, 44 feet beam, 28 feet in the hold. It was capable of carrying 2000 tons on three decks. Although Joshua Slocum called this ship \"my best command\", it was a command plagued with mutinies and mechanical problems. Under troubling legal circumstances (caused by his alleged treatment of the chief mutineer) he sold his share in the ''Northern Light 2'' in 1883.<ref>Geoffrey Wolff, ''The Hard Way Around: The Passages of Joshua Slocum, pgs. 76\u2013111''</ref>\n\n===The ''Aquidneck''===\nThe Slocum family continued on their next ship, the 326-ton ''Aquidneck''.  In 1884, Slocum's wife Virginia became ill aboard the ''Aquidneck'' in [[Buenos Aires]] and died.  After sailing to Massachusetts, Slocum left his three youngest children, Benjamin Aymar, Jessie, and Garfield in the care of his sisters; his oldest son Victor continued as his first mate.<ref>Berthold pg xix</ref>\n\nIn 1886, at age 42, Slocum married his 24-year-old cousin, Henrietta \"Hettie\" Elliott. The Slocum family, with the exception of Jessie and Benjamin Aymar, again took to the sea aboard the ''Aquidneck'', bound for [[Montevideo]], Uruguay.  Slocum's second wife would find life at sea much less appealing than his first.  A few days into Henrietta's first voyage, the ''Aquidneck'' sailed through a hurricane.  By the end of this first year, the crew had contracted [[cholera]], and they were quarantined for six months.<ref name=BertholdXX>Berthold pg xx</ref> Later, Slocum was forced to defend his ship from pirates, one of whom he shot and killed; he was tried and acquitted of murder.  Next, the ''Aquidneck'' was infected with [[smallpox]], leading to the death of three of the crew.  Disinfecting of the ship was performed at considerable cost. Shortly afterward, near the end of 1887, the unlucky ''Aquidneck'' was wrecked in southern Brazil.<ref name=BertholdXX/><ref name=VoyageLiberdade/>\n\n===The ''Liberdade''===\nAfter being stranded in Brazil with his wife and sons Garfield and Victor, he started building a boat that could sail them home. He used local materials, salvaged materials from the ''Aquidneck'' and worked with local workers. The boat was launched on May 13, 1888, the very day slavery was [[Slavery in Brazil#Steps towards freedom#Princess Isabel|abolished in Brazil]], and therefore the ship was given the Portuguese name ''Liberdade''.\nIt was an unusual {{convert|35|ft|m|adj=on}} [[junk rig|junk]]-rigged design which he described as \"half [[Cape Ann dory]] and half Japanese [[sampan]]\".<ref name=VoyageLiberdade>Slocum (1890), ''Voyage of the Liberdade''</ref> He and his family began their voyage back to the United States, his son Victor (15) being the mate.\n\nAfter fifty-five days at sea and 5510 miles,<ref>Victor Slocum (1950), p. 193</ref> the Slocums reached Cape Roman, [[South Carolina]]<ref>Cape Roman {{Coord|33|3|48|N|79|20|43|W|display=inline|name=Cape Roman}}</ref> and continued inland to Washington D.C. for winter and finally reaching Boston via New York in 1889.<ref name=VoyageLiberdade/> This was the last time Henrietta sailed with the family. In 1890, Slocum published the accounts of these adventures in ''Voyage of the Liberdade''.<ref name=VoyageLiberdade/><ref>Berthold pg xxi\u2013xxii</ref>\n\n==Voyage of the ''Destroyer''==\nIn the northern winter of 1893/94, Slocum undertook what he described as, at that time, being \"the hardest voyage that I have ever made, without any exception at all.\"<ref name=\"Eldritch Press: Voyage of the Detroyer\">{{cite web|last1=Slocum|first1=Joshua|title=Voyage of the Destroyer  from  New York to Brazil|url=http://www.eldritchpress.org/js/destroyer.htm|publisher=Eldritch Press|date=1894|accessdate=13 September 2016}}</ref> It involved delivering the steam-powered torpedo boat ''Destroyer'' from the east coast of the United States to Brazil.\n\n''Destroyer'' was a ship 130 feet in length, conceived by the Swedish-American inventor and mechanical engineer [[John Ericsson]], and intended for the defence of harbours and coastal waters. Equipped in the early 1880s with sloping armour plate and a bow-mounted submarine gun it was an evolution of the [[Monitor (warship)|Monitor warship type]] of the American Civil War. ''Destroyer'' was intended to fire an early form of torpedo at an opposing ship from a range of 300 feet, and was a \"vessel of war partially armored to attack bows-on at short range\".<ref name=\"Archive.org: Ericsson's Destroyer and Submarine Gun\">{{cite web|last1=Jaques|first1=William H.|title=Ericsson's Destroyer and Submarine Gun|url=https://archive.org/stream/ericssonsdestro00jaqugoog#page/n4/mode/2up|website=Archive.org|publisher=GP Putnam|accessdate=13 September 2016|date=1885}}</ref>\n\nDespite the loss of the ''Aquidneck'' and the privations of his family's voyage in the self-built ''Liberdade'', Slocum retained a fondness for Brazil. During 1893, Brazil was faced with a political crisis in Rio Grande do Sul and an attempt at civil war that was intensified by the revolt of the country's navy in September.<ref name=\"Stanford University Press: A Modern History of Brazil\">{{cite web|last1=Bello|first1=Jos\u00e9 Maria|title=A Modern History of Brazil: 1889-1964|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O26rAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA134|publisher=Stanford University Press|accessdate=13 September 2016|date=1966}}</ref>\n\nSlocum agreed to a request by the Brazilian government to deliver the ''Destroyer'' to Pernambuco, Brazil. His motive was also financial. As Slocum describes, his contract with the commander of government forces at Pernambuco was, \"to go against the rebel fleet, and sink them all, if we could find them \u2013 big and little \u2013 for a handsome sum of gold \u2026\" In addition, Slocum saw the possibility of getting even with the \"arch rebel\" Admiral Melo (whom he writes as \"Mello\"): \"Confidentially: I was burning to get a rake at Mello and his ''Aquideban''. He it was, who in that ship expelled my bark, the ''Aquidneck'', from lIha Grand some years ago, under the cowardly pretext that we might have sickness on board. But that story has been told. I was burning to let him know and palpably feel that this time I had in dynamite instead of hay\".\n\nTowed by the ''Santuit'', Slocum and a small crew aboard the ''Destroyer'' left Sandy Hook, New Jersey, on 7 December 1893. The following day the ship was already taking on water: \"A calamity has overtaken us. The ship's top seams are opening and one of the new sponsons, the starboard one, is already waterlogged\". Despite all hands pumping and bailing, by midnight the seas were extinguishing the fires in the boilers which were kept alight only by throwing on rounds of pork fat and tables and chairs from the vessel.\n\nWith a storm continuing to blow on the 9th, the crew was able to lower the level of water in the hold and plug some of the holes and leaks. Bailing out water using a large improvised canvas bag continued from the 9th to the 13th and succeeded in maintaining the level of water in the hold below three feet. On the 13th they were again hit by a storm and cross seas and had to bail all night. On the 14th, heavy seas disabled the rudder. By the afternoon of 15 December, the ''Destroyer'' was to the southwest of Puerto Rico, heading for Martinique, and still weathering storms.\n\nBy this time, with the fires in the boilers extinguished, all hands were bailing for their lives: \"The main hull of the ''Destroyer'' is already a foot under water, and going on down\". The crew had no other option than to keep bailing and try to keep the ship afloat, as the vessel \"could not be insured for the voyage; nor would any company insure a life on board\". By the morning of the 16th the storm had abated, allowing the ''Destroyer'' to anchor to the south of Puerto Rico.\n\nAlthough the ship's best steam pump had been put out of action on 19 December, more favourable seas allowed the crew to reach Martinique, where repairs were made before again setting sail on 5 January 1894. On 18 January the ''Destroyer'' arrived at Fernando de Noronha, an island some 175 miles from the coast of Brazil, before finally reaching Recife, Pernambuco, on the 20th.\n\nSlocum wrote: \"My voyage home from Brazil in the canoe ''Liberdade'', with my family for crew and companions, some years ago, although a much longer voyage was not of the same irksome nature\".\n\nAt Pernambuco, the ''Destroyer'' joined up with the Brazilian navy and the crew was again engaged in repairs as the long tow in heavy seaways had severed rivets at the bow, resulting in leaks.\n\nWet powder led to a failed test firing of the submarine gun and the ship was grounded to remove the projectile. But the strain of the swell led to a further leak. Following further repairs the ''Destroyer'' made for Bahia with replenishments of powder for the Brazilian fleet, arriving on 13 February. Once there, however, Admiral Goncalves of the Brazilian navy seized the ship. At the Arsenal at Bahia, an apparently incompetent alternative crew grounded the ''Destroyer'' on a rock in the basin. The vessel was holed and subsequently abandoned.\n\n==The ''Spray'': First solo circumnavigation of the earth==\n[[Image:Spray.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Spray (sailing vessel)|''Spray'']]]]\nIn [[Fairhaven, Massachusetts]], he rebuilt the {{convert|36|ft|9|in|abbr=on}} [[gaff rigged]] [[sloop]] oyster boat named ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]''.\n\nOn April 24, 1895, he set sail from [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. In his famous book, ''[[Sailing Alone Around the World]]'',<ref name=SailingAlone>Slocum (1899), ''Sailing Alone Around the World''</ref> now considered a classic of [[travel literature]], he described his departure in the following manner:\n\n{{quote|style=font-size: 85%; |text=I had resolved on a voyage around the world, and as the wind on the morning of April 24, 1895 was fair, at noon I weighed anchor, set sail, and filled away from Boston, where the ''Spray'' had been moored snugly all winter. The twelve o'clock whistles were blowing just as the sloop shot ahead under full sail. A short board was made up the harbor on the port tack, then coming about she stood to seaward, with her boom well off to port, and swung past the ferries with lively heels. A photographer on the outer pier of East Boston got a picture of her as she swept by, her flag at the peak throwing her folds clear. A thrilling pulse beat high in me. My step was light on deck in the crisp air. I felt there could be no turning back, and that I was engaging in an adventure the meaning of which I thoroughly understood.}}\n\nAfter an extended visit to his boyhood home at [[Brier Island, Nova Scotia|Brier Island]] and visiting old haunts on the coast of Nova Scotia, Slocum departed North America at [[Sambro Island Lighthouse]] near Halifax, Nova Scotia on July 3, 1895.\n\nSlocum intended to sail eastward around the world, using the [[Suez Canal]], but when he got near [[Gibraltar]] he realized that sailing through the southern Mediterranean would be too dangerous for a lone sailor because of the piracy that still went on there at that time. So he decided to sail westward, in the southern hemisphere. He headed to Brazil, and then the [[Straits of Magellan]]. At that point he was unable to start across the Pacific for forty days because of a storm. Eventually he made his way to Australia, sailed north along the east coast, crossed the Indian Ocean, rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]], and then headed back to North America.\n\nSlocum navigated without a [[Marine chronometer|chronometer]], instead relying on the traditional method of [[dead reckoning]] for longitude, which required only a cheap tin clock for approximate time, and noon-sun sights for latitude. On one long passage in the Pacific, Slocum also famously shot a [[Lunar distance (navigation)|lunar distance]] observation, decades after these observations had ceased to be commonly employed, which allowed him to check his longitude independently. However, Slocum's primary method for finding longitude was still dead reckoning; he recorded only one lunar observation during the entire circumnavigation.\n\nSlocum normally sailed the ''Spray'' without touching the helm. Due to the length of the sail plan relative to the hull, and the long keel, the ''Spray'' was capable of self-steering (unlike faster modern craft), and he balanced it stably on any course relative to the wind by adjusting or reefing the sails and by lashing the [[Steering wheel (ship)|helm]] fast. He sailed {{convert|2000|mi|km}} west across the Indian Ocean without once touching the helm.<ref name=SailingAlone/>\n\nMore than three years later, on June 27, 1898, he returned to [[Newport, Rhode Island]], having [[circumnavigation|circumnavigated]] the world, a distance of more than 46,000 miles (74,000&nbsp;km). Slocum's return went almost unnoticed. The [[Spanish\u2013American War]], which had begun two months earlier, dominated the headlines. After the end of major hostilities, many American newspapers published articles describing Slocum's amazing adventure.\n\n===''Sailing Alone Around the World''===\n[[Image:Sailing-Alone-Around-the-World-cover.jpg|thumb|left|Original cover 1900.]]\n[[File:Spray1901ErieCanal.jpg|thumb|right|Spray being hauled up the Erie Canal to the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo 1901.]]\nIn 1899 he published his account of the epic voyage in ''[[Sailing Alone Around the World]]'', first serialized in ''The Century Magazine'' and then in several book-length editions. Reviewers received the slightly anachronistic [[Age of Sail|age-of-sail]] adventure story enthusiastically. [[Arthur Ransome]] went so far as to declare, \"Boys who do not like this book ought to be drowned at once.\"<ref>[http://www.mywire.com/a/Oxford-Companion-World-Exploration/Slocum-Joshua/9516558 Arthur Ransome on ''Sailing Alone Around the World'']</ref> In his review, Sir [[Edwin Arnold]] wrote, \"I do not hesitate to call it the most extraordinary book ever published.\"\n\nSlocum's book deal was an integral part of his journey: his publisher had provided Slocum with an extensive on-board library, and Slocum wrote several letters to his editor from distant points around the globe.\n\nSlocum's ''Sailing Alone'' won him widespread fame in the English-speaking world. He was one of eight invited speakers at a dinner in honor of [[Mark Twain]] in December 1900. Slocum hauled the ''Spray'' up the Erie Canal to Buffalo, New York for the [[Pan-American Exposition]] in the summer of 1901, and he was well compensated for participating in the fair.\n\n==Later life==\nIn 1901, Slocum's book revenues and income from public lectures provided him enough financial security to purchase a small farm in [[West Tisbury, Massachusetts|West Tisbury]], on the island of [[Martha's Vineyard]], in Massachusetts. After a year and a half, he found he could not adapt to a settled life and Slocum sailed the ''Spray'' from port to port in the northeastern US during the summer and the [[West Indies]] during the winter, lecturing and selling books wherever he could. Slocum spent little time with his wife on the Vineyard and preferred life aboard the ''Spray'', usually wintering in the Caribbean.\n\nSlocum and the ''Spray'' visited [[Sagamore Hill]], the estate of US President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] on the north shore of Long Island, New York. Roosevelt and his family were interested in the tales of Slocum's solo [[circumnavigation]]. The President's young son, [[Archibald Roosevelt|Archie]], along with a guardian, spent the next few days sailing with Slocum up to Newport aboard the ''Spray'', which, by then, was a decrepit, weather-worn vessel. Slocum again met with President Roosevelt in May 1907, this time at the [[White House]] in Washington. Supposedly, Roosevelt said to him, \"Captain, our adventures have been a little different.\" Slocum answered, \"That is true, Mr. President, but I see you got here first.\"<ref name=\"Teller\">{{Cite book|title=Joshua Slocum|author=Teller, Walter Magnes|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|year=1971|isbn=0-8135-0700-6|location=New Brunswick, N.J|pages=|doi=|oclc=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/joshuaslocum00tell}}</ref>\n\nBy 1909, Slocum's funds were running low; book revenues had tailed off.

The name ''Spray'' has become a choice for cruising yachts ever since the publication of Slocum's account of his [[circumnavigation]].  Over the years, many versions of ''Spray'' have been built from the plans in Slocum's book, more or less reconstructing the sloop with various degrees of success.\n\nSimilarly, the French long-distance sailor [[Bernard Moitessier]] christened his {{convert|39|ft|m|adj=on}} [[ketch]]-rigged boat ''Joshua'' in honor of Slocum. It was this boat that Moitessier sailed from Tahiti to France, and he also sailed ''Joshua'' in the 1968 [[Sunday Times Golden Globe Race]] around the world, making great time, only to abandon the race near the end and sail on to the Polynesian Islands.\n\nFerries named in Slocum's honour (''Joshua Slocum'' and ''Spray'') served the two [[Digby Neck]] runs in Nova Scotia between 1973 and 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.valleyweb.com/westport/tsdbrier.html|title= valleyweb Resources and Information.|website=valleyweb.com}}</ref> The ''Joshua Slocum'' was featured in the film version of ''[[Dolores Claiborne (film)|Dolores Claiborne]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newscotland1398.net/digbyco/slocumjmem.html|title=Joshua Slocum Memorial|first=Ivan|last=Smith|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAn [[underwater glider]]\u2014an [[autonomous underwater vehicle]] (AUV), designed by the [[Scripps Institute of Oceanography]], was named after Slocum's ship ''Spray''.

Hanley Sch.JPG|thumb|left|Slocum's childhood school, now the [[Mount Hanley Schoolhouse Museum]]]]\nJoshua Slocum was born in the family's farm house in [[Mount Hanley, Nova Scotia|Mount Hanley]] and learned to read and write at the nearby [[Mount Hanley Schoolhouse Museum|Mount Hanley School]]. His earliest ventures on the water were made on coastal schooners operating out of the small ports such as Port George and Cottage Cove near Mount Hanley along the [[Bay of Fundy]].\n\nWhen Joshua was eight years old, the Slocombe family moved from Mount Hanley to [[Brier Island]] in [[Digby County]], at the mouth of the Bay of Fundy. Slocum's maternal grandfather was the keeper of the [[lighthouse]] at Southwest Point there. His father, a stern man and strict disciplinarian, took up making leather boots for the local fishermen, and Joshua helped in the shop. However, the boy found the scent of salt air much more alluring than the smell of shoe leather. He yearned for a life of adventure at sea, away from his demanding father and his increasingly chaotic life at home among so many brothers and sisters.\n\nHe made several attempts to run away from home, finally succeeding, at age fourteen, by hiring on as a [[cabin boy]] and cook on a fishing [[schooner]], but he soon returned home. In 1860, after the birth of the eleventh Slocombe (Joshua changed the spelling of his last name later in his life)<ref name=\"GeoffreyWolff\">Geoffrey Wolff, ''The Hard Way Around: The Passages of Joshua Slocum'')</ref> child and the subsequent death of his kindly mother, Joshua, then sixteen, left home for good. He and a friend signed on at [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] as ordinary seamen on a merchant ship bound for [[Dublin]], Ireland.\n\n==Early life at sea==\nFrom Dublin, he crossed to [[Liverpool]] to become an ordinary seaman on the British [[merchant ship]] ''Tangier'' (also recorded as ''Tanjore''), bound for China. During two years as a seaman, he rounded [[Cape Horn]] twice, landed at [[Jakarta|Batavia]] (now Jakarta) in the [[Dutch East Indies]], and visited the [[Maluku Islands]], [[Manila]], Hong Kong, [[Saigon]], Singapore, and San Francisco. While at sea, he studied for the [[Board of Trade]] examination, and, at the age of eighteen, he received his certificate as a fully qualified [[Second Mate]]. Slocum quickly rose through the ranks to become a [[Chief Mate]] on British ships transporting coal and grain between the British Isles and San Francisco.\n\nIn 1865, he settled in San Francisco, became an American citizen, and, after a period of [[salmon]] fishing and [[fur trading]] in the [[Oregon Territory]] of the northwest, he returned to the sea to pilot a schooner in the coastal trade between San Francisco and [[Seattle]]. His first blue-water command, in 1869, was the [[barque]] ''Washington'', which he took across the Pacific, from San Francisco to Australia, and home via [[Alaska]].\n\nHe sailed for thirteen years out of the port of San Francisco, transporting mixed cargo to China, Australia, the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]], and Japan. Between 1869 and 1889, he was the master of eight vessels, the first four of which (the ''Washington'', the ''Constitution'', the ''Benjamin Aymar'' and the ''Amethyst'') he commanded in the employ of others. Later, there would be four others that he himself owned, in whole or in part.\n\n==Family at sea==\nShortly before Christmas 1870, Slocum and the ''Washington'' put in at Sydney. There, in about a month's time, he met, courted, and married a young woman named Virginia Albertina Walker. Their marriage took place on January 31, 1871. Miss Walker, quite coincidentally, was an American whose New York family had migrated west to California at the time of the [[California gold rush|1849 gold rush]] and eventually continued on, by ship, to settle in Australia. She sailed with Slocum, and, over the next thirteen years, the couple had seven children, all born at sea or foreign ports. Four children, sons Victor, Benjamin Aymar, and James Garfield, and daughter Jessie, survived to adulthood.\n\nIn Alaska, the ''Washington'' was [[shipwreck|wrecked]] when she dragged her anchor during a gale, ran ashore, and broke up. Slocum, however, at considerable risk to himself, managed to save his wife, the crew, and much of the cargo, bringing all back to port safely in the ship's open boats. The owners of the shipping company that had employed Slocum were so impressed by this feat of ingenuity and leadership, they gave him the command of the ''Constitution'' which he sailed to Hawaii and the west coast of [[Mexico]].\n\nHis next command was the ''Benjamin Aymar'', a merchant vessel in the [[Pacific Ocean|South Seas]] trade. However, the owner, strapped for cash, sold the vessel out from under Slocum, and he and Virginia found themselves stranded in the [[Philippines]] without a ship.\n\n=== The ''Pato'' ===\nWhile in the Philippines, in 1874, under a commission from a British architect, Slocum organized native workers to build a 150-ton [[Steamboat|steamer]] in the shipyard at [[Subic Bay]]. In partial payment for the work, he was given the ninety-ton schooner, ''Pato'' (Spanish for \"Duck\"), the first ship he could call his own.\n\nOwnership of the ''Pato'' afforded Slocum the kind of freedom and autonomy he had never experienced before. Hiring a crew, he contracted to deliver a cargo to [[Vancouver]] in British Columbia. Thereafter, he used the ''Pato'' as a general freight carrier along the west coast of North America and in voyages back and forth between San Francisco and Hawaii. During this period, Slocum also fulfilled a long-held ambition to become a writer; he became a temporary correspondent for the ''San Francisco Bee''.\n\nThe Slocums sold the ''Pato'' in Honolulu in the spring of 1878. Returning to San Francisco, they purchased the ''Amethyst.'' He worked this ship until June 23, 1881.<ref>Geoffrey Wolff, ''The Hard Way Around: The Passages of Joshua Slocum, pgs. 70\u201375''</ref>\n \nThe Slocums next bought a third share in the ''Northern Light 2''. This large clipper was 233 feet in length, 44 feet beam, 28 feet in the hold. It was capable of carrying 2000 tons on three decks. Although Joshua Slocum called this ship \"my best command\", it was a command plagued with mutinies and mechanical problems. Under troubling legal circumstances (caused by his alleged treatment of the chief mutineer) he sold his share in the ''Northern Light 2'' in 1883.<ref>Geoffrey Wolff, ''The Hard Way Around: The Passages of Joshua Slocum, pgs. 76\u2013111''</ref>\n\n===The ''Aquidneck''===\nThe Slocum family continued on their next ship, the 326-ton ''Aquidneck''.  In 1884, Slocum's wife Virginia became ill aboard the ''Aquidneck'' in [[Buenos Aires]] and died.  After sailing to Massachusetts, Slocum left his three youngest children, Benjamin Aymar, Jessie, and Garfield in the care of his sisters; his oldest son Victor continued as his first mate.<ref>Berthold pg xix</ref>\n\nIn 1886, at age 42, Slocum married his 24-year-old cousin, Henrietta \"Hettie\" Elliott. The Slocum family, with the exception of Jessie and Benjamin Aymar, again took to the sea aboard the ''Aquidneck'', bound for [[Montevideo]], Uruguay.  Slocum's second wife would find life at sea much less appealing than his first.  A few days into Henrietta's first voyage, the ''Aquidneck'' sailed through a hurricane.  By the end of this first year, the crew had contracted [[cholera]], and they were quarantined for six months.<ref name=BertholdXX>Berthold pg xx</ref> Later, Slocum was forced to defend his ship from pirates, one of whom he shot and killed; he was tried and acquitted of murder.  Next, the ''Aquidneck'' was infected with [[smallpox]], leading to the death of three of the crew.  Disinfecting of the ship was performed at considerable cost. Shortly afterward, near the end of 1887, the unlucky ''Aquidneck'' was wrecked in southern Brazil.<ref name=BertholdXX/><ref name=VoyageLiberdade/>\n\n===The ''Liberdade''===\nAfter being stranded in Brazil with his wife and sons Garfield and Victor, he started building a boat that could sail them home. He used local materials, salvaged materials from the ''Aquidneck'' and worked with local workers. The boat was launched on May 13, 1888, the very day slavery was [[Slavery in Brazil#Steps towards freedom#Princess Isabel|abolished in Brazil]], and therefore the ship was given the Portuguese name ''Liberdade''.\nIt was an unusual {{convert|35|ft|m|adj=on}} [[junk rig|junk]]-rigged design which he described as \"half [[Cape Ann dory]] and half Japanese [[sampan]]\".<ref name=VoyageLiberdade>Slocum (1890), ''Voyage of the Liberdade''</ref> He and his family began their voyage back to the United States, his son Victor (15) being the mate.\n\nAfter fifty-five days at sea and 5510 miles,<ref>Victor Slocum (1950), p. 193</ref> the Slocums reached Cape Roman, [[South Carolina]]<ref>Cape Roman {{Coord|33|3|48|N|79|20|43|W|display=inline|name=Cape Roman}}</ref> and continued inland to Washington D.C. for winter and finally reaching Boston via New York in 1889.<ref name=VoyageLiberdade/> This was the last time Henrietta sailed with the family. In 1890, Slocum published the accounts of these adventures in ''Voyage of the Liberdade''.<ref name=VoyageLiberdade/><ref>Berthold pg xxi\u2013xxii</ref>\n\n==Voyage of the ''Destroyer''==\nIn the northern winter of 1893/94, Slocum undertook what he described as, at that time, being \"the hardest voyage that I have ever made, without any exception at all.\"<ref name=\"Eldritch Press: Voyage of the Detroyer\">{{cite web|last1=Slocum|first1=Joshua|title=Voyage of the Destroyer  from  New York to Brazil|url=http://www.eldritchpress.org/js/destroyer.htm|publisher=Eldritch Press|date=1894|accessdate=13 September 2016}}</ref> It involved delivering the steam-powered torpedo boat ''Destroyer'' from the east coast of the United States to Brazil.\n\n''Destroyer'' was a ship 130 feet in length, conceived by the Swedish-American inventor and mechanical engineer [[John Ericsson]], and intended for the defence of harbours and coastal waters. Equipped in the early 1880s with sloping armour plate and a bow-mounted submarine gun it was an evolution of the [[Monitor (warship)|Monitor warship type]] of the American Civil War. ''Destroyer'' was intended to fire an early form of torpedo at an opposing ship from a range of 300 feet, and was a \"vessel of war partially armored to attack bows-on at short range\".<ref name=\"Archive.org: Ericsson's Destroyer and Submarine Gun\">{{cite web|last1=Jaques|first1=William H.|title=Ericsson's Destroyer and Submarine Gun|url=https://archive.org/stream/ericssonsdestro00jaqugoog#page/n4/mode/2up|website=Archive.org|publisher=GP Putnam|accessdate=13 September 2016|date=1885}}</ref>\n\nDespite the loss of the ''Aquidneck'' and the privations of his family's voyage in the self-built ''Liberdade'', Slocum retained a fondness for Brazil. During 1893, Brazil was faced with a political crisis in Rio Grande do Sul and an attempt at civil war that was intensified by the revolt of the country's navy in September.<ref name=\"Stanford University Press: A Modern History of Brazil\">{{cite web|last1=Bello|first1=Jos\u00e9 Maria|title=A Modern History of Brazil: 1889-1964|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O26rAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA134|publisher=Stanford University Press|accessdate=13 September 2016|date=1966}}</ref>\n\nSlocum agreed to a request by the Brazilian government to deliver the ''Destroyer'' to Pernambuco, Brazil. His motive was also financial. As Slocum describes, his contract with the commander of government forces at Pernambuco was, \"to go against the rebel fleet, and sink them all, if we could find them \u2013 big and little \u2013 for a handsome sum of gold \u2026\" In addition, Slocum saw the possibility of getting even with the \"arch rebel\" Admiral Melo (whom he writes as \"Mello\"): \"Confidentially: I was burning to get a rake at Mello and his ''Aquideban''. He it was, who in that ship expelled my bark, the ''Aquidneck'', from lIha Grand some years ago, under the cowardly pretext that we might have sickness on board. But that story has been told. I was burning to let him know and palpably feel that this time I had in dynamite instead of hay\".\n\nTowed by the ''Santuit'', Slocum and a small crew aboard the ''Destroyer'' left Sandy Hook, New Jersey, on 7 December 1893. The following day the ship was already taking on water: \"A calamity has overtaken us. The ship's top seams are opening and one of the new sponsons, the starboard one, is already waterlogged\". Despite all hands pumping and bailing, by midnight the seas were extinguishing the fires in the boilers which were kept alight only by throwing on rounds of pork fat and tables and chairs from the vessel.\n\nWith a storm continuing to blow on the 9th, the crew was able to lower the level of water in the hold and plug some of the holes and leaks. Bailing out water using a large improvised canvas bag continued from the 9th to the 13th and succeeded in maintaining the level of water in the hold below three feet. On the 13th they were again hit by a storm and cross seas and had to bail all night. On the 14th, heavy seas disabled the rudder. By the afternoon of 15 December, the ''Destroyer'' was to the southwest of Puerto Rico, heading for Martinique, and still weathering storms.\n\nBy this time, with the fires in the boilers extinguished, all hands were bailing for their lives: \"The main hull of the ''Destroyer'' is already a foot under water, and going on down\". The crew had no other option than to keep bailing and try to keep the ship afloat, as the vessel \"could not be insured for the voyage; nor would any company insure a life on board\". By the morning of the 16th the storm had abated, allowing the ''Destroyer'' to anchor to the south of Puerto Rico.\n\nAlthough the ship's best steam pump had been put out of action on 19 December, more favourable seas allowed the crew to reach Martinique, where repairs were made before again setting sail on 5 January 1894. On 18 January the ''Destroyer'' arrived at Fernando de Noronha, an island some 175 miles from the coast of Brazil, before finally reaching Recife, Pernambuco, on the 20th.\n\nSlocum wrote: \"My voyage home from Brazil in the canoe ''Liberdade'', with my family for crew and companions, some years ago, although a much longer voyage was not of the same irksome nature\".\n\nAt Pernambuco, the ''Destroyer'' joined up with the Brazilian navy and the crew was again engaged in repairs as the long tow in heavy seaways had severed rivets at the bow, resulting in leaks.\n\nWet powder led to a failed test firing of the submarine gun and the ship was grounded to remove the projectile. But the strain of the swell led to a further leak. Following further repairs the ''Destroyer'' made for Bahia with replenishments of powder for the Brazilian fleet, arriving on 13 February. Once there, however, Admiral Goncalves of the Brazilian navy seized the ship. At the Arsenal at Bahia, an apparently incompetent alternative crew grounded the ''Destroyer'' on a rock in the basin. The vessel was holed and subsequently abandoned.\n\n==The ''Spray'': First solo circumnavigation of the earth==\n[[Image:Spray.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Spray (sailing vessel)|''Spray'']]]]\nIn [[Fairhaven, Massachusetts]], he rebuilt the {{convert|36|ft|9|in|abbr=on}} [[gaff rigged]] [[sloop]] oyster boat named ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]''.\n\nOn April 24, 1895, he set sail from [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. In his famous book, ''[[Sailing Alone Around the World]]'',<ref name=SailingAlone>Slocum (1899), ''Sailing Alone Around the World''</ref> now considered a classic of [[travel literature]], he described his departure in the following manner:\n\n{{quote|style=font-size: 85%; |text=I had resolved on a voyage around the world, and as the wind on the morning of April 24, 1895 was fair, at noon I weighed anchor, set sail, and filled away from Boston, where the ''Spray'' had been moored snugly all winter. The twelve o'clock whistles were blowing just as the sloop shot ahead under full sail. A short board was made up the harbor on the port tack, then coming about she stood to seaward, with her boom well off to port, and swung past the ferries with lively heels. A photographer on the outer pier of East Boston got a picture of her as she swept by, her flag at the peak throwing her folds clear. A thrilling pulse beat high in me. My step was light on deck in the crisp air. I felt there could be no turning back, and that I was engaging in an adventure the meaning of which I thoroughly understood.}}\n\nAfter an extended visit to his boyhood home at [[Brier Island, Nova Scotia|Brier Island]] and visiting old haunts on the coast of Nova Scotia, Slocum departed North America at [[Sambro Island Lighthouse]] near Halifax, Nova Scotia on July 3, 1895.\n\nSlocum intended to sail eastward around the world, using the [[Suez Canal]], but when he got near [[Gibraltar]] he realized that sailing through the southern Mediterranean would be too dangerous for a lone sailor because of the piracy that still went on there at that time. So he decided to sail westward, in the southern hemisphere. He headed to Brazil, and then the [[Straits of Magellan]]. At that point he was unable to start across the Pacific for forty days because of a storm. Eventually he made his way to Australia, sailed north along the east coast, crossed the Indian Ocean, rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]], and then headed back to North America.\n\nSlocum navigated without a [[Marine chronometer|chronometer]], instead relying on the traditional method of [[dead reckoning]] for longitude, which required only a cheap tin clock for approximate time, and noon-sun sights for latitude. On one long passage in the Pacific, Slocum also famously shot a [[Lunar distance (navigation)|lunar distance]] observation, decades after these observations had ceased to be commonly employed, which allowed him to check his longitude independently. However, Slocum's primary method for finding longitude was still dead reckoning; he recorded only one lunar observation during the entire circumnavigation.\n\nSlocum normally sailed the ''Spray'' without touching the helm. Due to the length of the sail plan relative to the hull, and the long keel, the ''Spray'' was capable of self-steering (unlike faster modern craft), and he balanced it stably on any course relative to the wind by adjusting or reefing the sails and by lashing the [[Steering wheel (ship)|helm]] fast. He sailed {{convert|2000|mi|km}} west across the Indian Ocean without once touching the helm.<ref name=SailingAlone/>\n\nMore than three years later, on June 27, 1898, he returned to [[Newport, Rhode Island]], having [[circumnavigation|circumnavigated]] the world, a distance of more than 46,000 miles (74,000&nbsp;km). Slocum's return went almost unnoticed. The [[Spanish\u2013American War]], which had begun two months earlier, dominated the headlines. After the end of major hostilities, many American newspapers published articles describing Slocum's amazing adventure.\n\n===''Sailing Alone Around the World''===\n[[Image:Sailing-Alone-Around-the-World-cover.jpg|thumb|left|Original cover 1900.]]\n[[File:Spray1901ErieCanal.jpg|thumb|right|Spray being hauled up the Erie Canal to the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo 1901.]]\nIn 1899 he published his account of the epic voyage in ''[[Sailing Alone Around the World]]'', first serialized in ''The Century Magazine'' and then in several book-length editions. Reviewers received the slightly anachronistic [[Age of Sail|age-of-sail]] adventure story enthusiastically. [[Arthur Ransome]] went so far as to declare, \"Boys who do not like this book ought to be drowned at once.\"<ref>[http://www.mywire.com/a/Oxford-Companion-World-Exploration/Slocum-Joshua/9516558 Arthur Ransome on ''Sailing Alone Around the World'']</ref> In his review, Sir [[Edwin Arnold]] wrote, \"I do not hesitate to call it the most extraordinary book ever published.\"\n\nSlocum's book deal was an integral part of his journey: his publisher had provided Slocum with an extensive on-board library, and Slocum wrote several letters to his editor from distant points around the globe.\n\nSlocum's ''Sailing Alone'' won him widespread fame in the English-speaking world. He was one of eight invited speakers at a dinner in honor of [[Mark Twain]] in December 1900. Slocum hauled the ''Spray'' up the Erie Canal to Buffalo, New York for the [[Pan-American Exposition]] in the summer of 1901, and he was well compensated for participating in the fair.\n\n==Later life==\nIn 1901, Slocum's book revenues and income from public lectures provided him enough financial security to purchase a small farm in [[West Tisbury, Massachusetts|West Tisbury]], on the island of [[Martha's Vineyard]], in Massachusetts. After a year and a half, he found he could not adapt to a settled life and Slocum sailed the ''Spray'' from port to port in the northeastern US during the summer and the [[West Indies]] during the winter, lecturing and selling books wherever he could. Slocum spent little time with his wife on the Vineyard and preferred life aboard the ''Spray'', usually wintering in the Caribbean.\n\nSlocum and the ''Spray'' visited [[Sagamore Hill]], the estate of US President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] on the north shore of Long Island, New York. Roosevelt and his family were interested in the tales of Slocum's solo [[circumnavigation]]. The President's young son, [[Archibald Roosevelt|Archie]], along with a guardian, spent the next few days sailing with Slocum up to Newport aboard the ''Spray'', which, by then, was a decrepit, weather-worn vessel. Slocum again met with President Roosevelt in May 1907, this time at the [[White House]] in Washington. Supposedly, Roosevelt said to him, \"Captain, our adventures have been a little different.\" Slocum answered, \"That is true, Mr. President, but I see you got here first.\"<ref name=\"Teller\">{{Cite book|title=Joshua Slocum|author=Teller, Walter Magnes|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|year=1971|isbn=0-8135-0700-6|location=New Brunswick, N.J|pages=|doi=|oclc=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/joshuaslocum00tell}}</ref>\n\nBy 1909, Slocum's funds were running low; book revenues had tailed off.

In July 1910, his wife informed the newspapers that she believed he was lost at sea.\n\nAt the time, most who knew Slocum believed that the ''Spray'' had been run down by a steamer<ref>This was the theory of [[Edward Rowe Snow]]; see [https://books.google.com/books?id=OCuUrlhaP68C&pg=PT142#v=onepage&q=Edward%20Rowe%20Snow%20theory%20on%20Joshua%20Slocum Ann Spencer's \"Alone At Sea: The Adventures of Joshua Slocum\"]</ref> or struck by a whale, the ''Spray'' being too sound a craft and Slocum too experienced a mariner for any other cause to be considered likely.<ref name=\"spencer\">{{cite book |last=Spencer |first=Ann |date=1998 |title=Alone At Sea: The Adventures of Joshua Slocum |url= |location= |publisher=Doubleday Canada |page= |isbn=0385257201 }}</ref>\n\nDespite being an experienced mariner, Slocum never learned to swim<ref name=\"spencer\"/> and considered learning to swim to be useless.\n\nIn 1924, Joshua Slocum was declared legally dead.<ref name=\"spencer\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n\nJoshua Slocum's achievements have been well publicised and honoured. The name ''Spray'' has become a choice for cruising yachts ever since the publication of Slocum's account of his [[circumnavigation]].  Over the years, many versions of ''Spray'' have been built from the plans in Slocum's book, more or less reconstructing the sloop with various degrees of success.\n\nSimilarly, the French long-distance sailor [[Bernard Moitessier]] christened his {{convert|39|ft|m|adj=on}} [[ketch]]-rigged boat ''Joshua'' in honor of Slocum. It was this boat that Moitessier sailed from Tahiti to France, and he also sailed ''Joshua'' in the 1968 [[Sunday Times Golden Globe Race]] around the world, making great time, only to abandon the race near the end and sail on to the Polynesian Islands.\n\nFerries named in Slocum's honour (''Joshua Slocum'' and ''Spray'') served the two [[Digby Neck]] runs in Nova Scotia between 1973 and 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.valleyweb.com/westport/tsdbrier.html|title= valleyweb Resources and Information.|website=valleyweb.com}}</ref> The ''Joshua Slocum'' was featured in the film version of ''[[Dolores Claiborne (film)|Dolores Claiborne]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newscotland1398.net/digbyco/slocumjmem.html|title=Joshua Slocum Memorial|first=Ivan|last=Smith|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAn [[underwater glider]]\u2014an [[autonomous underwater vehicle]] (AUV), designed by the [[Scripps Institute of Oceanography]], was named after Slocum's ship ''Spray''. It became the first AUV to cross the Gulf Stream, while operated by the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://spray.ucsd.edu/|publisher=UC San Diego|title=Spray AUV}}</ref> Another AUV has been named after Slocum himself: the Slocum Electric Glider, designed by Douglas Webb of Webb Research (since 2008, [[Teledyne Technologies#Companies|Teledyne Webb Research]]).\n\nIn 2009, a [[Slocum glider]], modified by Rutgers University, crossed the Atlantic in 221 days.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://rucool.marine.rutgers.edu/atlantic/status_updates.html| title=Flight Across the Atlantic - RU27 - RU17| website=marine.rutgers.edu}}</ref> The RU27 traveled from Tuckerton, New Jersey, to [[Baiona, Pontevedra]], Spain \u2014 the port where [[Christopher Columbus]] landed on his return from his first voyage to the New World. Like Slocum himself, the Slocum glider is capable of traveling over thousands of kilometers. These gliders continue to be used by various research institutions, including Texas A&M University's Department of Oceanography and Geochemical and Environmental Research Group (GERG), to explore the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and other [[bodies of water]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://today.tamu.edu/2013/07/31/gliders-give-key-ocean-data-from-gulf/|publisher=Texas A&M University|title=Gliders give key ocean data from gulf}}</ref>\n\nA monument to Slocum exists on [[Brier Island, Nova Scotia]], not far from his family's boot shop. Slocum is commemorated in museum exhibits at the [[New Bedford Whaling Museum]] in Massachusetts, the [[Maritime Museum of the Atlantic]] in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and the [[Mount Hanley Schoolhouse Museum]] near his birthplace.  Several biographies about Slocum are published.\n\nThe Slocum River in [[Dartmouth, Massachusetts]] was named for him, as was a newly discovered plant in [[Mauritius]] while he was there: \"Returning to the ''Spray'' by way of the great flower conservatory near Moka, the proprietor, having only that morning discovered a new and hardy plant, to my great honor named it 'Slocum'\".<ref>Slocum, J (1899), Chapter XVII</ref> Slocum himself discovered an island by accident, and named it ''Alan Erric Island''.<ref>Slocum, J (1899), chapter X</ref>\n\nSlocum was inducted into the [[National Sailing Hall of Fame]] in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nshof.org/inductees/reynolds-mark/|title=Joshua Slocum 2011 Inductee |publisher=Nshof.org |date= |accessdate=April 12, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography}}\n*[[Harry Pidgeon]], first to solo circumnavigate via the Panama Canal\n*[[List of people who disappeared at sea]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{Cite book|contribution=Introduction |title=Sailing Alone Around the World |editor-last=Berthold |editor-first=Dennis A. |publisher=[[Barnes & Noble]]|location=New York |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-59308-303-8 |pages=xiii\u2013xxxvi |nopp=true |author-mask=Joshua |postscript=<!--None--> |author-link=Slocum}}\n* {{Cite book|title=[[Sailing Alone Around the World]] |authorlink=Joshua Slocum |first=Joshua |last=Slocum |publisher=[[Barnes & Noble]] |location=New York |origyear=1899 |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-59308-303-8}}\n* {{Cite book|title=Voyage of the Liberdade |authorlink=Joshua Slocum |first=Joshua |last=Slocum |publisher=[[Robinson & Stephenson]] |location=Boston |origyear=1890 |year=1890 }}\n* {{Cite book|title=Capt.

The Anglia was a simple vehicle aimed at the cheap end of the market, with few features. Most were painted Ford black. Styling was typically late-1930s, with an upright radiator. There were standard and deluxe models, the latter having better instrumentation and, on pre-war models, running boards. Both front and rear suspensions used transverse leaf springs, and the brakes were mechanical.\n\nThe two-door Anglia is similar to the longer, four-door, E93A Ford Prefect. A bulge at the back enabled a spare wheel to be removed from its vertical outside stowage on the back of the car and stowed flat on the boot floor, which usefully increased luggage space. Some back seat leg room was sacrificed to the luggage space, being reduced from 43\u00be inches in the [[Ford 7Y]] to 38\u00bd inches in the Anglia.<ref name=Autocar1971/> The Anglia replaced the 7Y saloon, but the van version of the earlier model continued to be built until 1946, after which some very minor changes sufficed to rebaptize the van the \"E04C\".<ref name=Ballard48>[[#BBsmall|Ballard]], p. 48</ref>\n\nThe domestic market engine was the {{convert|933|cc|cid|abbr=on}} [[Inline-four engine|straight-four]] side-valve engine familiar to drivers of [[Ford Model Y|predecessor models]] since 1933.<ref name=Autocar1971/> The 1172&nbsp;cc straight-four engine from the [[Ford Model C Ten|Ford Ten]] was fitted for some export markets, including North America, where imports began for model year 1948; these cars used the slightly more aerodynamic \"three-hole\" grille from the 1937-38 [[Ford 7W|Ford Ten 7W]], prefacing the 1949 E494A facelift. They also had sealed beam headlights and small, separate parking lights mounted underneath, as well as dual tail lights, into which flashing turn signals could be added without adding additional lights. A minor styling change was made in December 1947, with the name \"Anglia\" now incorporated in the top of the grille surround.<ref name=Ballard_E04A/>\n\nThe car retained a vacuum-powered wiper with its tendency to slow down or stop above about 40&nbsp;mph (64&nbsp;km/h), the point at which the [[Manifold vacuum|suction effect from the induction manifold]] disappeared; however, the Anglia's wipers were supported by a vacuum reservoir, which partially addressed the propensity to stop entirely when the car was accelerated.<ref name=Autocar1971/>\n\nA contemporary road test commended the Anglia's ability to pull away from 5 or 6&nbsp;mph (8 or 10&nbsp;km/h) in top gear.<ref name=Autocar1971/> Compulsory driving tests had only recently been introduced in the UK. Most potential buyers would approach the vehicle without the benefit of formal driving tuition.

It was a completely new car, its style following the example of the larger [[Ford Consul]] introduced two years earlier and of its German counterpart, the [[Ford Taunus P1]], by featuring a modern [[Three-box styling|three-box design]]. The 100E was available as a two-door Anglia and a four-door Prefect. During this period, the old Anglia was available as the 103E Popular, touted as the cheapest car in the world.\n\nInternally there were individual front seats trimmed in PVC, hinged to allow access to the rear.  The instruments (speedometer, fuel gauge and ammeter) were placed in a cluster around the steering column and the gear change was floor mounted. A heater and radio were optional extras. The dashboard was revised twice; the binnacle surrounding the steering column was replaced by a central panel with twin dials towards the driver's side in 1956; the last from 1959 had twin dials in a binnacle in front of the driver and 'magic ribbon' AC speedo similar to the 1957 E-series Vauxhall Velox/Cresta and '58/'59 PA models, and included a [[glovebox]].\n\nUnder the bonnet the 100E still housed an antiquated, but actually new, {{Convert|36|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} side-valve engine sharing the bore and stroke of the old unit but now with larger bearings and inlet valves and pump-assisted cooling. The three-speed gearbox was retained. Some models were fitted with a semi-automatic \"Manumatic\" gearbox.  A second wind-screen wiper was now included at no extra cost,<ref name=Autocar1971/> although the wipers' vacuum-powered operation was also retained: by now this was seen as seriously old-fashioned and the wipers were notorious for slowing down when driving up steep hills, or coming to a complete rest when trying to overtake. The separate chassis construction of the previous models was replaced by unitary construction and the front suspension used \"hydraulic telescopic dampers and coil springs\"<ref name=\"Autocar1953\">{{cite journal |title=Ford Anglia Saloon (road test) |journal=[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]] |date=2 October 1952}}</ref> \u2013 now called [[MacPherson strut]]s, a term that had not yet entered the public lexicon \u2013 with anti-roll bar and semi-elliptic leaf springs at the rear.

There were from 1955 two [[estate car]] versions, similar to the [[Thames 300E]] vans but fitted with side windows, folding rear seats and a horizontally split tailgate. This necessitated moving the fuel tank. These were the basic Escort and better appointed [[Ford Squire|Squire]], which sported wood trim down the sides. This feature has become a common feature of some Ford estates/station wagons ever since.

The base model was the Standard, and this sported no chromework, painted rear light surrounds, steel slatted grille and limited interior trim. The deluxe had a chrome side strip, chrome rear lights, glovebox lid, sun visor and full width chrome radiator grille. The top of the range was the Super, which had twin chrome side strips, contrasting coloured roof and side flash, plusher interior trim, together with the 1198 cc engine and a gearbox with synchromesh on first gear.\n\nOptional extras were the mechanical upgrade of a Deluxe to a Super, retaining the Deluxe trim, or the upgrade of a Deluxe to a Super trim, but retaining the 997 cc engine, an option rarely taken up.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Ford Anglia Sportsman - Charleroi 2019 - 07.jpg|Ford Anglia Sportsman (1965)\n</gallery>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==In popular culture==\n\n*BBC Television's popular ''[[Z-Cars]]'' serial mimicked real life police forces' adoption of small patrol cars, known as [[Panda Car]]s due to their 'duck egg blue' paintwork, with a broad vertical white stripe running right over the doors and roof.

The Anglia was a simple vehicle aimed at the cheap end of the market, with few features. Most were painted Ford black. Styling was typically late-1930s, with an upright radiator. There were standard and deluxe models, the latter having better instrumentation and, on pre-war models, running boards. Both front and rear suspensions used transverse leaf springs, and the brakes were mechanical.\n\nThe two-door Anglia is similar to the longer, four-door, E93A Ford Prefect. A bulge at the back enabled a spare wheel to be removed from its vertical outside stowage on the back of the car and stowed flat on the boot floor, which usefully increased luggage space. Some back seat leg room was sacrificed to the luggage space, being reduced from 43\u00be inches in the [[Ford 7Y]] to 38\u00bd inches in the Anglia.<ref name=Autocar1971/> The Anglia replaced the 7Y saloon, but the van version of the earlier model continued to be built until 1946, after which some very minor changes sufficed to rebaptize the van the \"E04C\".<ref name=Ballard48>[[#BBsmall|Ballard]], p. 48</ref>\n\nThe domestic market engine was the {{convert|933|cc|cid|abbr=on}} [[Inline-four engine|straight-four]] side-valve engine familiar to drivers of [[Ford Model Y|predecessor models]] since 1933.<ref name=Autocar1971/> The 1172&nbsp;cc straight-four engine from the [[Ford Model C Ten|Ford Ten]] was fitted for some export markets, including North America, where imports began for model year 1948; these cars used the slightly more aerodynamic \"three-hole\" grille from the 1937-38 [[Ford 7W|Ford Ten 7W]], prefacing the 1949 E494A facelift. They also had sealed beam headlights and small, separate parking lights mounted underneath, as well as dual tail lights, into which flashing turn signals could be added without adding additional lights. A minor styling change was made in December 1947, with the name \"Anglia\" now incorporated in the top of the grille surround.<ref name=Ballard_E04A/>\n\nThe car retained a vacuum-powered wiper with its tendency to slow down or stop above about 40&nbsp;mph (64&nbsp;km/h), the point at which the [[Manifold vacuum|suction effect from the induction manifold]] disappeared; however, the Anglia's wipers were supported by a vacuum reservoir, which partially addressed the propensity to stop entirely when the car was accelerated.<ref name=Autocar1971/>\n\nA contemporary road test commended the Anglia's ability to pull away from 5 or 6&nbsp;mph (8 or 10&nbsp;km/h) in top gear.<ref name=Autocar1971/> Compulsory driving tests had only recently been introduced in the UK. Most potential buyers would approach the vehicle without the benefit of formal driving tuition.  The cars did have synchromesh between second and top gears, but not between first and second,<ref name=Autocar1971/> so many would have sought, wherever possible, to avoid en route changes down to first.\n\nProduction, hindered by the diversion of Ford's factory to military production during the Second World War, ceased in 1948 after 55,807 had been built. Initial sales in Britain actually began in early 1940. Production was suspended in early 1942, and resumed in mid-1945.\n\nThe E04A was also built in Australia from 1940 to 1945 and was produced in [[tourer]] and [[Roadster (automobile)|roadster]] body styles.<ref name=Ballard_E04A/> The former had a rear seat and the latter was a two-seater convertible.<ref name=Ballard_E04A/>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n{{anchor|A54A}}\n\n==Anglia A54A (Australia: 1946\u201348)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Ford Anglia A54A\n| image        = Ford Anglia 4-Door Sedan 1948.JPG\n| caption       =1948 Ford Anglia A54A 4-Door Sedan\n| production   = 1946\u201348<ref name=Ballard_A54A>[[#BBsmall|Ballard]], p. 62</ref>\n| assembly  = Australia<ref name=Ballard_A54A/>\n| engine       = {{convert|933|cc|cid|abbr=on}} [[Straight-4|I4]]<ref name=Ballard_A54A/>\n| body_style   = 4-door [[Sedan (car)|sedan]]<ref name=Ballard_A54A/> <br /> 2-door [[tourer]]<ref name=Ballard_A54A/> <br /> 2-door [[coupe utility]]<ref name=Ballard_A54A/> <br /> 2-door [[panel van]]\n| related      = \n}}\nThe Australian-built Anglia A54A used the chassis and front panels of the British E04A and was offered in 4-door [[Sedan (car)|sedan]], [[tourer]], [[coupe utility]] and [[panel van]] body styles.<ref name=Ballard_A54A/> The 8HP 933cc engine was used and all models featured running boards.<ref name=Ballard_A54A/>\n\nThree different types of radiator grille were fitted to A54A models.<ref name=Ballard_A54A/> Both the original and the revised E04A grilles were used and a third style, unique to the A54A, was introduced in 1948.<ref name=Ballard_A54A/> This featured a centrally placed vertical chrome strip.<ref name=Ballard_A54A/>\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Wuppertaler Geschichtsfest 2012 16.JPG|1947 Ford Anglia A54A Tourer\nFile:1948 Ford Anglia A54A Tourer.jpg|1948 Ford Anglia A54A Tourer (showing the third and final A54A grille style)\nFile:1942 Ford Anglia A54A Coupe Utility (8705965336).jpg|Ford Anglia A54A Coupe Utility\n</gallery>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n{{anchor|E494A}}\n\n==Anglia E494A (1949\u201353)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Ford Anglia E494A\n| image        = 1953 Ford Anglia E494A 930cc.jpg\n| caption      = 1953 Ford Anglia E494A\n| production   = 1949\u201353<br />108,878 units<ref name=AZ1945/>\n| engine       = {{convert|933|cc|cid|abbr=on}} [[Straight-4|I4]]\n|transmission  = 3 speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]\n| body_style   = 2-door saloon<br />2-door [[panel van]]\n| related      =\n| height       = {{convert|63|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=Motor1948/>\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|90|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=Motor1948/>\n| length       = {{convert|154|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=Motor1948/>\n| width        = {{convert|57|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=Motor1948/>\n}}\n\nThe 1949 model, code E494A, was a makeover of the previous model with a rather more 1940s style front-end, including the sloped, twin-lobed radiator grille.

It was a completely new car, its style following the example of the larger [[Ford Consul]] introduced two years earlier and of its German counterpart, the [[Ford Taunus P1]], by featuring a modern [[Three-box styling|three-box design]]. The 100E was available as a two-door Anglia and a four-door Prefect. During this period, the old Anglia was available as the 103E Popular, touted as the cheapest car in the world.\n\nInternally there were individual front seats trimmed in PVC, hinged to allow access to the rear.  The instruments (speedometer, fuel gauge and ammeter) were placed in a cluster around the steering column and the gear change was floor mounted. A heater and radio were optional extras. The dashboard was revised twice; the binnacle surrounding the steering column was replaced by a central panel with twin dials towards the driver's side in 1956; the last from 1959 had twin dials in a binnacle in front of the driver and 'magic ribbon' AC speedo similar to the 1957 E-series Vauxhall Velox/Cresta and '58/'59 PA models, and included a [[glovebox]].\n\nUnder the bonnet the 100E still housed an antiquated, but actually new, {{Convert|36|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} side-valve engine sharing the bore and stroke of the old unit but now with larger bearings and inlet valves and pump-assisted cooling. The three-speed gearbox was retained. Some models were fitted with a semi-automatic \"Manumatic\" gearbox.  A second wind-screen wiper was now included at no extra cost,<ref name=Autocar1971/> although the wipers' vacuum-powered operation was also retained: by now this was seen as seriously old-fashioned and the wipers were notorious for slowing down when driving up steep hills, or coming to a complete rest when trying to overtake. The separate chassis construction of the previous models was replaced by unitary construction and the front suspension used \"hydraulic telescopic dampers and coil springs\"<ref name=\"Autocar1953\">{{cite journal |title=Ford Anglia Saloon (road test) |journal=[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]] |date=2 October 1952}}</ref> \u2013 now called [[MacPherson strut]]s, a term that had not yet entered the public lexicon \u2013 with anti-roll bar and semi-elliptic leaf springs at the rear.

There were from 1955 two [[estate car]] versions, similar to the [[Thames 300E]] vans but fitted with side windows, folding rear seats and a horizontally split tailgate. This necessitated moving the fuel tank. These were the basic Escort and better appointed [[Ford Squire|Squire]], which sported wood trim down the sides. This feature has become a common feature of some Ford estates/station wagons ever since. The basic van variant was badged as a [[Thames 300E|Thames]] product, as were all Ford commercials following the dropping of the Fordson badge.\n\nAn Anglia saloon tested by the British ''Motor'' magazine in 1954 had a top speed of {{convert|70.2|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and could accelerate from 0-{{convert|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in 29.4 seconds.

Its American-influenced styling included a sweeping nose line, and on deluxe versions, a full-width slanted chrome grille in between prominent \"eye\" headlamps. (Basic Anglias featured a narrower, painted grille.<ref name=Drive198503/>) Its smoothly sloped line there looked more like a 1950s [[Studebaker]] (or even early [[Ford Thunderbird]]) than the more aggressive-looking late-'50s American Fords, possibly because its British designers used wind-tunnel testing and streamlining{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}.

In fact, this look was imported from the 1958 [[Lincoln Continental#Third generation (1958\u201360)|Lincoln Continental]],<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/classiccars/8217595/Classic-Ford-Anglia-105E.html |title=Classic Ford Anglia 105E |newspaper=Telegraph |date=4 January 2011 |accessdate=20 November 2011}}</ref> where it had been the accidental result of a design specification for an electrically opening (breezeway) rear window. It had muted tailfins, much toned-down from its American counterparts. An estate car joined the saloon in the line-up in September 1961.

Acceleration from rest was still sluggish, but it was much improved from earlier cars. Also new for British Fords was a four-speed manual gearbox with synchromesh on the top three forward ratios: this was replaced by an all-synchromesh box in September 1962 (on 1198 powered cars).<ref name=Drive198503>{{cite journal |last=Mullins |first=John |authorlink= |title=Time Machines: Little belter: Ford Anglia 1959\u20131967 |journal=Drive (Magazine of the British [[The Automobile Association|Automobile Association]]) |volume= 116 |pages=18\u201319 |date=March 1985}}</ref>  The notoriously feeble vacuum-powered windscreen wipers of earlier Anglias were replaced with more conventional windscreen wipers powered by their own electric motor.<ref name=Drive198503/> The Macpherson strut independent front suspension used on the 100E was retained.\n\nIn October 1962, 24-year-old twins Tony and Michael Brookes<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Francis, V.
