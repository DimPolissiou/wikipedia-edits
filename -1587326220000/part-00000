Evidence from the geological record is consistent with the physics that shows that adding large amounts of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere warms the world and may lead to: higher sea levels and flooding of low-lying coasts; greatly changed patterns of rainfall; increased acidity of the oceans; and decreased oxygen levels in seawater.\n\nThere is now widespread concern that the Earth's climate will warm further, not only because of the lingering effects of the added carbon already in the system, but also because of further additions as human population continues to grow. Life on Earth has survived large climate changes in the past, but extinctions and major redistribution of species have been associated with many of them. When the human population was small and nomadic, a rise in sea level of a few metres would have had very little effect on Homo sapiens. With the current and growing global population, much of which is concentrated in coastal cities, such a rise in sea level would have a drastic effect on our complex society, especially if the climate were to change as suddenly as it has at times in the past. Equally, it seems likely that as warming continues some areas may experience less precipitation leading to drought.

The dominant cause of the warming since the 1950s is human activities. This scientific finding is based on a large and persuasive body of research. The observed warming will be irreversible for many years into the future, and even larger temperature increases will occur as greenhouse gases continue to accumulate in the atmosphere. Avoiding this future warming will require a large and rapid reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions. The ongoing warming will increase risks and stresses to human societies, economies, ecosystems, and wildlife through the 21st century and beyond, making it imperative that society respond to a changing climate. To inform decisions on adaptation and mitigation, it is critical that we improve our understanding of the global climate system and our ability to project future climate through continued and improved monitoring and research. This is especially true for smaller (seasonal and regional) scales and weather and climate extremes, and for important hydroclimatic variables such as precipitation and water availability.\n\nTechnological, economic, and policy choices in the near future will determine the extent of future impacts of climate change. Science-based decisions are seldom made in a context of absolute certainty. National and international policy discussions should include consideration of the best ways to both adapt to and mitigate climate change. Mitigation will reduce the amount of future climate change and the risk of impacts that are potentially large and dangerous.

They have concluded that the majority of scientists support the idea of anthropogenic climate change.\n\nIn 2004, the geologist and historian of science [[Naomi Oreskes]] summarized a study of the scientific literature on climate change.<ref name=\"Beyond the Ivory Tower: The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change\"/> She analyzed 928 [[abstract (summary)|abstracts]] of papers from refereed scientific journals between 1993 and 2003 and concluded that there is a scientific consensus on the reality of [[anthropogenic climate change]].\n\nOreskes divided the abstracts into six categories: explicit endorsement of the consensus position, evaluation of impacts, mitigation proposals, methods, [[Paleoclimatology|paleoclimate]] analysis, and rejection of the consensus position. Seventy-five per cent of the abstracts were placed in the first three categories (either explicitly or implicitly accepting the consensus view); 25% dealt with methods or paleoclimate, thus taking no position on current anthropogenic climate change. None of the abstracts disagreed with the consensus position, which the author found to be \"remarkable\". According to the report, \"authors evaluating impacts, developing methods, or studying paleoclimatic change might believe that current climate change is natural. However, none of these papers argued that point.\"\n\nIn 2007, [[Harris Insights & Analytics|Harris Interactive]] surveyed 489 randomly selected members of either the [[American Meteorological Society]] or the [[American Geophysical Union]] for the [[Statistical Assessment Service]] (STATS) at [[George Mason University]]. 97% of the scientists surveyed agreed that global temperatures had increased during the past 100 years; 84% said they personally believed human-induced warming was occurring, and 74% agreed that \"currently available scientific evidence\" substantiated its occurrence. Catastrophic effects in 50\u2013100 years would likely be observed according to 41%, while 44% thought the effects would be moderate and about 13 percent saw relatively little danger. 5% said they thought human activity did not contribute to greenhouse warming.<ref name=\"Survey Tracks Scientists' Growing Climate Concern\"/><ref name=\"Climate Scientists Agree on Warming, Disagree on Dangers, and Don't Trust the Media's Coverage of Climate Change\">{{cite web |last=Lichter |first=S.

A total of 373 responses were received giving an overall response rate of 18.2%. No paper on climate change consensus based on this survey has been published yet (February 2010), but one on another subject has been published based on the survey.<ref name=\"Prediction' or 'Projection; The nomenclature of climate science\"/>\n\nThe survey was made up of 76 questions split into a number of sections.\nThere were sections on the demographics of the respondents, their assessment of the state of climate science, how good the science is, climate change impacts, adaptation and mitigation, their opinion of the IPCC, and how well climate science was being communicated to the public.\nMost of the answers were on a scale from 1 to 7 from \"not at all\" to \"very much\".\n\nTo the question \"How convinced are you that climate change, whether natural or anthropogenic, is occurring now?\", 67.1% said they very much agreed, 26.7% agreed to some large extent, 6.2% said to they agreed to some small extent (2\u20134), none said they did not agree at all. To the question \"How convinced are you that most of recent or near future climate change is, or will\nbe, a result of anthropogenic causes?\" the responses were 34.6% very much agree, 48.9% agreeing to a large extent, 15.1% to a small extent, and 1.35% not agreeing at all.\n\nA poll performed by [[Peter Doran]] and Maggie Kendall Zimmerman at [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] received replies from 3,146 of the 10,257 polled Earth scientists. Results were analyzed globally and by specialization. 76 out of 79 [[climatologists]] who \"listed climate science as their area of expertise and who also have published more than 50% of their recent peer-reviewed papers on the subject of climate change\" believed that mean global temperatures had risen compared to pre-1800s levels. Seventy-five of 77 believed that human activity is a significant factor in changing mean global temperatures. Among all respondents, 90% agreed that temperatures have risen compared to pre-1800 levels, and 82% agreed that humans significantly influence the global temperature. [[Economic geologist]]s and [[meteorologist]]s were among the biggest doubters, with only 47 percent and 64 percent, respectively, believing in significant human involvement. The authors summarised the findings:\n\n{{quote|It seems that the debate on the authenticity of global warming and the role played by human activity is largely nonexistent among those who understand the nuances and scientific basis of long-term climate processes.<ref name=\"DZ_EOS_2009\"/>}}\n\nA 2010 paper in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States'']] (PNAS) reviewed publication and citation data for 1,372 climate researchers and drew the following two conclusions:\n\n<blockquote>(i) 97\u201398% of the climate researchers most actively publishing in the field support the tenets of ACC (Anthropogenic Climate Change) outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and (ii) the relative climate expertise and scientific prominence of the researchers unconvinced of ACC are substantially below that of the convinced researchers.<ref name=\"Expert credibility in climate change\"/></blockquote>\n\nA 2013 paper in [[Environmental Research Letters]] reviewed 11,944 abstracts of scientific papers matching \"global warming\" or \"global climate change\".

The world's most important greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide, a by-product of the burning of fossil fuels. Since the time of the Industrial Revolution about 200 years ago, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased from about 280 parts per million to 370 parts per million, an increase of around 30%.  On the basis of available data, climate scientists are now projecting an average global temperature rise over this century of 2.0 to 4.5\u00b0C. This compared with 0.6\u00b0C over the previous century \u2013 about a 500% increase... This could lead to changing, and for all emissions scenarios more unpredictable, weather patterns around the world, less frost days, more extreme events (droughts and storm or flood disasters), and warmer sea temperatures and melting glaciers causing sea levels to rise.  ... Professional engineers commonly deal with risk, and frequently have to make judgments based on incomplete data. The available evidence suggests very strongly that human activities have already begun to make significant changes to the earth's climate, and that the long-term risk of delaying action is greater than the cost of avoiding/minimising the risk.\"</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Letter to US Senators\">{{citation |url=http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2009/media/1021climate_letter.pdf |title=Letter to US Senators |date=October 2009}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"journalistsresource\">{{cite news|url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/environment/climate-change/structure-scientific-opinion-climate-change/|title=\"Structure of Scientific Opinion on Climate Change\" at Journalist's Resource.org}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"nagt\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nagt.org/index.html|title=NAGT|website=NAGT}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"nagt11\">{{cite web|url=https://nagt.org/nagt/policy/ps-climate.html|title=Position Statement - Teaching Climate Change|website=NAGT|accessdate=2019-11-28}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"nationalacademies\">[http://www.nationalacademies.org/onpi/06072005.pdf Joint science academies\u2019 statement: Global response to climate change], 2005</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"nas\">\n{{cite book\n | year=2008\n | title=Understanding and Responding to Climate Change.

The global warming observed over the past 50 years is due primarily to human-induced emissions of heat-trapping gases. These emissions come mainly from the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas), with important contributions from the clearing of forests, agricultural practices, and other activities.}}\n\nThe 2009 report, which is about the effects that climate change is having in the United States, also said:\n\n{{quote|Climate-related changes have already been observed globally and in the United States. These include increases in air and water temperatures, reduced frost days, increased frequency and intensity of heavy downpours, a rise in sea level, and reduced snow cover, glaciers, permafrost, and sea ice. A longer ice-free period on lakes and rivers, lengthening of the growing season, and increased [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere have also been observed.

The statement, printed in an editorial in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' on May 18, 2001,<ref name=\"Editorial: The Science of Climate Change\"/> was signed by the science academies of Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, the Caribbean, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Malaysia, New Zealand, Sweden, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"The Science of Climate Change\"/>\n* 2005 The national science academies of the [[G8]] nations, plus Brazil, China and India, three of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases in the developing world, signed a statement on the global response to climate change. The statement stresses that the scientific understanding of climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify nations taking prompt action, and explicitly endorsed the IPCC consensus.

Evidence from the geological record is consistent with the physics that shows that adding large amounts of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere warms the world and may lead to: higher sea levels and flooding of low-lying coasts; greatly changed patterns of rainfall; increased acidity of the oceans; and decreased oxygen levels in seawater.\n\nThere is now widespread concern that the Earth's climate will warm further, not only because of the lingering effects of the added carbon already in the system, but also because of further additions as human population continues to grow. Life on Earth has survived large climate changes in the past, but extinctions and major redistribution of species have been associated with many of them. When the human population was small and nomadic, a rise in sea level of a few metres would have had very little effect on Homo sapiens. With the current and growing global population, much of which is concentrated in coastal cities, such a rise in sea level would have a drastic effect on our complex society, especially if the climate were to change as suddenly as it has at times in the past.

The dominant cause of the warming since the 1950s is human activities. This scientific finding is based on a large and persuasive body of research. The observed warming will be irreversible for many years into the future, and even larger temperature increases will occur as greenhouse gases continue to accumulate in the atmosphere. Avoiding this future warming will require a large and rapid reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions. The ongoing warming will increase risks and stresses to human societies, economies, ecosystems, and wildlife through the 21st century and beyond, making it imperative that society respond to a changing climate. To inform decisions on adaptation and mitigation, it is critical that we improve our understanding of the global climate system and our ability to project future climate through continued and improved monitoring and research. This is especially true for smaller (seasonal and regional) scales and weather and climate extremes, and for important hydroclimatic variables such as precipitation and water availability.\n\nTechnological, economic, and policy choices in the near future will determine the extent of future impacts of climate change. Science-based decisions are seldom made in a context of absolute certainty. National and international policy discussions should include consideration of the best ways to both adapt to and mitigate climate change. Mitigation will reduce the amount of future climate change and the risk of impacts that are potentially large and dangerous. At the same time, some continued climate change is inevitable, and policy responses should include adaptation to climate change. Prudence dictates extreme care in accounting for our relationship with the only planet known to be capable of sustaining human life.<ref name=\"ametsoc\"/>}}\n\nA 2016 survey found that two-thirds of AMS members think that all or most of climate change is caused by human activity.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Maibach\n | first =Edward\n | title =A 2016 National Survey of American Meteorological Society Member Views on Climate Change: Initial Findings\n | publisher =George Mason University\n | date =March 2016\n | pages =25\n | url =https://gmuchss.az1.qualtrics.com/CP/File.php?F=F_cRR9lW0HjZaiVV3 }}</ref>\n\n===== Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society =====\nThe [[Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society]] has issued a ''Statement on Climate Change'', wherein they conclude:\n\n{{quote|Global climate change and global warming are real and observable ...

They have concluded that the majority of scientists support the idea of anthropogenic climate change.\n\nIn 2004, the geologist and historian of science [[Naomi Oreskes]] summarized a study of the scientific literature on climate change.<ref name=\"Beyond the Ivory Tower: The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change\"/> She analyzed 928 [[abstract (summary)|abstracts]] of papers from refereed scientific journals between 1993 and 2003 and concluded that there is a scientific consensus on the reality of [[anthropogenic climate change]].\n\nOreskes divided the abstracts into six categories: explicit endorsement of the consensus position, evaluation of impacts, mitigation proposals, methods, [[Paleoclimatology|paleoclimate]] analysis, and rejection of the consensus position. Seventy-five per cent of the abstracts were placed in the first three categories (either explicitly or implicitly accepting the consensus view); 25% dealt with methods or paleoclimate, thus taking no position on current anthropogenic climate change. None of the abstracts disagreed with the consensus position, which the author found to be \"remarkable\". According to the report, \"authors evaluating impacts, developing methods, or studying paleoclimatic change might believe that current climate change is natural. However, none of these papers argued that point.\"\n\nIn 2007, [[Harris Insights & Analytics|Harris Interactive]] surveyed 489 randomly selected members of either the [[American Meteorological Society]] or the [[American Geophysical Union]] for the [[Statistical Assessment Service]] (STATS) at [[George Mason University]]. 97% of the scientists surveyed agreed that global temperatures had increased during the past 100 years; 84% said they personally believed human-induced warming was occurring, and 74% agreed that \"currently available scientific evidence\" substantiated its occurrence. Catastrophic effects in 50\u2013100 years would likely be observed according to 41%, while 44% thought the effects would be moderate and about 13 percent saw relatively little danger. 5% said they thought human activity did not contribute to greenhouse warming.<ref name=\"Survey Tracks Scientists' Growing Climate Concern\"/><ref name=\"Climate Scientists Agree on Warming, Disagree on Dangers, and Don't Trust the Media's Coverage of Climate Change\">{{cite web |last=Lichter |first=S.

To the question \"How convinced are you that most of recent or near future climate change is, or will\nbe, a result of anthropogenic causes?\" the responses were 34.6% very much agree, 48.9% agreeing to a large extent, 15.1% to a small extent, and 1.35% not agreeing at all.\n\nA poll performed by [[Peter Doran]] and Maggie Kendall Zimmerman at [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] received replies from 3,146 of the 10,257 polled Earth scientists. Results were analyzed globally and by specialization. 76 out of 79 [[climatologists]] who \"listed climate science as their area of expertise and who also have published more than 50% of their recent peer-reviewed papers on the subject of climate change\" believed that mean global temperatures had risen compared to pre-1800s levels.

The world's most important greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide, a by-product of the burning of fossil fuels. Since the time of the Industrial Revolution about 200 years ago, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased from about 280 parts per million to 370 parts per million, an increase of around 30%.  On the basis of available data, climate scientists are now projecting an average global temperature rise over this century of 2.0 to 4.5\u00b0C.

The race has been run every year since its inception with the exception of 1936, where the race was not run due to [[Great Depression in France#From depression to war|worker strikes]], and 1940 to 1948, due to [[World War II]].  Records for wins are also listed. Lower class wins are not included.\n\nAfter the first 44 events had two drivers per winning entry, the winning entry used three drivers in 1977, which became the winning norm from 1985 onwards. With multiple drivers per winning entry, tempered by some drivers winning more than once, a total of 136 different drivers have won in the [[2019 24 Hours of Le Mans|86 runnings]] of the race.\n\n==Winners==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

The race has been run every year since its inception with the exception of 1936, where the race was not run due to [[Great Depression in France#From depression to war|worker strikes]], and 1940 to 1948, due to [[World War II]].  Records for wins are also listed. Lower class wins are not included.\n\nAfter the first 44 events had two drivers per winning entry, the winning entry used three drivers in 1977, which became the winning norm from 1985 onwards. With multiple drivers per winning entry, tempered by some drivers winning more than once, a total of 136 different drivers have won in the [[2019 24 Hours of Le Mans|86 runnings]] of the race.\n\n==Winners==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

Netherton also neighbours [[Sefton, Merseyside|Sefton Village]].\n\nNetherton is a mostly residential area, comprising the semi-rural '''Netherton Village,''' (which consists of privately owned houses set around the old Village Green) and the large [[council estate]] built by the former Bootle Borough Council on the other side of the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]].\n\nThe estate is unusual in the fact that many of the houses are still occupied by the same residents who moved in as young couples with families when the houses were brand new.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} The social profile of the first resident population does not comply to modern notions of council estate dwellers.  Many of these people were hard working people with middle class aspirations, whose lives and careers were interrupted and often changed forever by the Second World War.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} However, the demographics of the Netherton area have changed significantly over time. A large number of the male residents moved in from all parts of the country to be key skilled workers at the English Electric factory heavy engineering works on Dunnings Bridge Road.\n\nThe main estate, centred on '''Marian Square,''' was built in the mid 1950s to alleviate housing shortages in Bootle after the heavy bombing the town suffered during the Second World War.  Historical records show that of about 18,000 houses in Bootle, only about 1,000 survived the German bombings completely intact. A remaining 16,000 houses were partially damaged and over a thousand completely destroyed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n'''The Sefton Estate''' (which includes Stonyfield, Waterside, Harrops Croft and Higher End Park) was built by Lancashire County Council some ten years after the Netherton estate in the mid 1960s and were the first council houses in the area to have [[central heating]].\n\nMarian Square is opposite the health centre in Magdalene Square (the two squares are divided by Glovers Lane, and should not be confused). The first shops (approximately five, including a health clinic and opticians) were built on Magdalene Square and were later demolished when the new shops and first new post office on Marian Square were opened. The original plans for the redevelopment for Magdalene Square, which were on view as a model in Bootle Town Hall in 1965, were for a 22 storey tower block and a leisure complex including swimming pool, neither of which were built (probably due to a lack of further investment in the area).\n\nThere were also plans for a large ring road to link the motorways at Switch Island, running across fields to the north of the Sefton estate with the centre of Bootle and the landward side of [[Crosby, Merseyside|Crosby]], along a corridor of land which included the Rimrose Valley.  The council purchased land along this corridor but the road was never built.  There is a large mound of earth next to the small church near the Cabbage Inn (near the present fire station); which shows the start of the earthworks for the flyover linking the proposed ring road to the goods depot on the railway line near the Girobank building on Netherton Way. The proposed ring road is shown on some old Liverpool A to Z street plans.\n\nThe unused land in the Rimrose Valley was made into an area of parkland, and new houses are being built on the old allotments at the other end of the Rimrose Valley in Litherland.\n\nNotable firms which hold, or once held, premises in Netherton include:- Braby's; English Electric; Forticrete; Metal Box; Movie (cleaning products); National Girobank; Peerless Refining Co.; North West Timber; Porter Chadburn; Post Office Telecommunications (British Telecom.); Scott's Bakery (now part of Allied Bakeries) and now the site of a large trading estate including cinema, Matalan store and a pub called the Bakers Dozen; Wimpey and to [[Alliance and Leicester]].\n\nNetherton was formerly the home of the [[Everton F.C.]] youth academy, which has now been relocated to [[Finch Farm]]. The land was previously a fire station (the old brick building on the site) and the grounds of Littlewoods Social Club. This area has now been turned into a Goals football centre.\n\nOn 19 August 2015 the Thornton to Switch Island link road ([[A5758 road|A5758]]) was opened.<ref>{{cite web|url=\nhttps://www.sefton.gov.uk/parking,-roads-travel/broom%E2%80%99s-cross-road-%28thornton-to-switch-island-link%29.aspx|title=Broom\u2019s Cross Road (Thornton to Switch Island Link)|publisher=Sefton Council|accessdate=18 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History & local government==\nNetherton was anciently a [[township (England)|township]] associated with the [[parish]] of Sefton, becoming an independent [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] in 1866.  It became part of [[Sefton Rural District]] under the [[Local Government Act 1894]], and then [[West Lancashire Rural District]] in 1932.<ref>Youngs, Guide to the Local Administrative Units of England, Volume 2.</ref>\n\nNetherton parish lost areas to the [[county borough]] of [[Bootle]] in 1940, 1951 and 1968 (reducing the parish from {{convert|1124|acre|km2|0}} in 1931 to {{convert|469|acre|km2|1}} in 1951).  The residual parish no longer exists, forming part of [[Sefton, Merseyside|Sefton]] parish.\n\nThe area has been a part of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Sefton]] since local government reorganisation on 1 April 1974.\n\nFor [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliamentary elections]] Netherton is within the [[Bootle (UK Parliament constituency)|Bootle]] constituency represented by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] MP [[Peter Dowd]].\n\nFor elections to [[Sefton Metropolitan Borough Council|Sefton Council]] Netherton is split between the [[Ward (country subdivision)|electoral wards]] of [[Netherton and Orrell (ward)|Netherton and Orrell]], whose three representatives are [http://modgov.sefton.gov.uk/moderngov/mgUserInfo.asp?UID=605 Susan Ellen Bradshaw], [http://modgov.sefton.gov.uk/moderngov/mgUserInfo.asp?UID=162 Robert John Brennan], and [http://modgov.sefton.gov.uk/moderngov/mgUserInfo.asp?UID=218 Ian Ralph Maher], and [[St. Oswald (ward)|St. Oswald]], whose three representatives are [http://modgov.sefton.gov.uk/moderngov/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=184 Paula Spencer], [http://modgov.sefton.gov.uk/moderngov/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=185 Carla Thomas] and [http://modgov.sefton.gov.uk/moderngov/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=219 Linda Cluskey]. All six councillors who represent the Netherton area are members of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].\n\n==Architecture==\nThe oldest houses are to be found at the heart of the old hamlet of Netherton, clustered around the green in what is now known as Netherton Village, just north of the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]]. The old catholic [[St Benet's Chapel, Netherton|church of St. Benet]] nearby was built in 1793.<ref>[[Nikolaus Pevsner|Pevsner]], Nikolaus - The Buildings of England: South Lancashire, 1969.</ref> Unusually it appears as an ordinary house from the road with the church backing onto what was once open fields. A modern church was built over the road in the 1970s.\n\nNowadays, Netherton is formed with many modern housing, the most recent being the [[George Wimpey]] estate, completed in 2000, built just {{convert|100|yd|m|-2}} from Netherton Village green.  Housing in this part of Netherton is considered rather desirable, unlike the council-owned housing closer to the town's shopping amenities.\n\n==Education==\nNetherton is home to one secondary school, [[Savio High School]]. Formerly there was St Ambrose Barlow High School, Bootle Grammar School and Warwick Bolam County Secondary School as well as a Girl's County Secondary School. In August 2009, [[Bootle High School]] closed its doors for the last time as students transferred to [[Litherland High School]].  In December 2009, works started to demolish the school on Browns Lane.\nNow however the properties on the council estate are mostly privately owned and were bought under the [[right to buy scheme]] brought in by the conservative government under Margaret Thatcher. St Ambrose Barlow was formerly St. Catherine's Roman Catholic High School and was for girls only, also closed on 11 November 2016. The corresponding boy's school was St. Thomas Aquinas Roman Catholic High School, situated approximately on mile away on the other side of the canal.\n\n==Transport==\nNetherton is served by two railway-stations: [[Aintree railway station|Aintree]] and [[Old Roan railway station|Old Roan]], on the [[Northern Line (Merseyrail)|Northern Line]] of the [[Merseyrail]] network. The Old Roan station is technically in Aintree, but is on the border between the two areas. Old Roan bus station is next to the railway-station. Buses run from here and Magdalene Square into central [[Liverpool]] (those from Magdalene Square also serve parts of [[Bootle]]) as well as North to [[Maghull]], [[Ormskirk]] and [[Southport]].\n\nThe area is situated close to the major interchange, [[Switch Island]], at the end of the [[M57 motorway|M57]] and [[M58 motorway|M58]] motorways.\n\nThe [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]] flows through Netherton and whilst this provides a local amenity, there is very little boat traffic on this stretch of its course.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Netherton, Merseyside}}\n*[http://liverpoolstreetgallery.com/thumbnails.php?album=32 Liverpool Street Gallery - Liverpool 30]\n*[http://www.emmanuelnetherton.org Netherton Baptist Church]\n*[http://www.seftonarts.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/ Netherton Arts Centre]\n*[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit_page.jsp?u_id=10373864 Netherton on a Vision of Britain website]\n*[https://www.sefton.gov.uk/parking,-roads-travel/broom%E2%80%99s-cross-road-%28thornton-to-switch-island-link%29.aspx ]\n{{Metropolitan Borough of Sefton}}\n\n[[Category:Towns and villages in the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\n{{More citations needed|date=October 2008}}\n{{Infobox UK place\n|country = England\n|coordinates = {{coord|53.4938|-2.9677|display=inline,title}}\n|official_name = Netherton\n|label_position = left\n|population =   \n|population_ref =    \n|metropolitan_borough = [[Metropolitan Borough of Sefton|Sefton]]\n|metropolitan_county = [[Merseyside]]\n|region = North West England\n|constituency_westminster = [[Bootle (UK Parliament constituency)|Bootle]]\n|post_town = BOOTLE\n|postcode_district = L30\n|postcode_area = L   \n|dial_code = 0151\n|os_grid_reference = SJ352997\n|map_type = Merseyside\n|static_image_name = Netherton Village.JPG\n|static_image_caption = Netherton Village\n}}\n'''Netherton''' is an area of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Sefton]], on [[Merseyside]], [[England]] but historically in [[Lancashire]].\n\n==Description==\nSituated in the southern part of the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton, north east of the centre of [[Bootle]], Netherton is also north of [[Litherland]] and to the west of [[Aintree]].

A large number of the male residents moved in from all parts of the country to be key skilled workers at the English Electric factory heavy engineering works on Dunnings Bridge Road.\n\nThe main estate, centred on '''Marian Square,''' was built in the mid 1950s to alleviate housing shortages in Bootle after the heavy bombing the town suffered during the Second World War.  Historical records show that of about 18,000 houses in Bootle, only about 1,000 survived the German bombings completely intact. A remaining 16,000 houses were partially damaged and over a thousand completely destroyed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n'''The Sefton Estate''' (which includes Stonyfield, Waterside, Harrops Croft and Higher End Park) was built by Lancashire County Council some ten years after the Netherton estate in the mid 1960s and were the first council houses in the area to have [[central heating]].\n\nMarian Square is opposite the health centre in Magdalene Square (the two squares are divided by Glovers Lane, and should not be confused). The first shops (approximately five, including a health clinic and opticians) were built on Magdalene Square and were later demolished when the new shops and first new post office on Marian Square were opened. The original plans for the redevelopment for Magdalene Square, which were on view as a model in Bootle Town Hall in 1965, were for a 22 storey tower block and a leisure complex including swimming pool, neither of which were built (probably due to a lack of further investment in the area).\n\nThere were also plans for a large ring road to link the motorways at Switch Island, running across fields to the north of the Sefton estate with the centre of Bootle and the landward side of [[Crosby, Merseyside|Crosby]], along a corridor of land which included the Rimrose Valley.  The council purchased land along this corridor but the road was never built.  There is a large mound of earth next to the small church near the Cabbage Inn (near the present fire station); which shows the start of the earthworks for the flyover linking the proposed ring road to the goods depot on the railway line near the Girobank building on Netherton Way. The proposed ring road is shown on some old Liverpool A to Z street plans.\n\nThe unused land in the Rimrose Valley was made into an area of parkland, and new houses are being built on the old allotments at the other end of the Rimrose Valley in Litherland.\n\nNotable firms which hold, or once held, premises in Netherton include:- Braby's; English Electric; Forticrete; Metal Box; Movie (cleaning products); National Girobank; Peerless Refining Co.; North West Timber; Porter Chadburn; Post Office Telecommunications (British Telecom.); Scott's Bakery (now part of Allied Bakeries) and now the site of a large trading estate including cinema, Matalan store and a pub called the Bakers Dozen; Wimpey and to [[Alliance and Leicester]].\n\nNetherton was formerly the home of the [[Everton F.C.]] youth academy, which has now been relocated to [[Finch Farm]]. The land was previously a fire station (the old brick building on the site) and the grounds of Littlewoods Social Club. This area has now been turned into a Goals football centre.\n\nOn 19 August 2015 the Thornton to Switch Island link road ([[A5758 road|A5758]]) was opened.<ref>{{cite web|url=\nhttps://www.sefton.gov.uk/parking,-roads-travel/broom%E2%80%99s-cross-road-%28thornton-to-switch-island-link%29.aspx|title=Broom\u2019s Cross Road (Thornton to Switch Island Link)|publisher=Sefton Council|accessdate=18 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History & local government==\nNetherton was anciently a [[township (England)|township]] associated with the [[parish]] of Sefton, becoming an independent [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] in 1866.  It became part of [[Sefton Rural District]] under the [[Local Government Act 1894]], and then [[West Lancashire Rural District]] in 1932.<ref>Youngs, Guide to the Local Administrative Units of England, Volume 2.</ref>\n\nNetherton parish lost areas to the [[county borough]] of [[Bootle]] in 1940, 1951 and 1968 (reducing the parish from {{convert|1124|acre|km2|0}} in 1931 to {{convert|469|acre|km2|1}} in 1951).  The residual parish no longer exists, forming part of [[Sefton, Merseyside|Sefton]] parish.\n\nThe area has been a part of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Sefton]] since local government reorganisation on 1 April 1974.\n\nFor [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliamentary elections]] Netherton is within the [[Bootle (UK Parliament constituency)|Bootle]] constituency represented by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] MP [[Peter Dowd]].\n\nFor elections to [[Sefton Metropolitan Borough Council|Sefton Council]] Netherton is split between the [[Ward (country subdivision)|electoral wards]] of [[Netherton and Orrell (ward)|Netherton and Orrell]], whose three representatives are [http://modgov.sefton.gov.uk/moderngov/mgUserInfo.asp?UID=605 Susan Ellen Bradshaw], [http://modgov.sefton.gov.uk/moderngov/mgUserInfo.asp?UID=162 Robert John Brennan], and [http://modgov.sefton.gov.uk/moderngov/mgUserInfo.asp?UID=218 Ian Ralph Maher], and [[St. Oswald (ward)|St. Oswald]], whose three representatives are [http://modgov.sefton.gov.uk/moderngov/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=184 Paula Spencer], [http://modgov.sefton.gov.uk/moderngov/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=185 Carla Thomas] and [http://modgov.sefton.gov.uk/moderngov/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=219 Linda Cluskey]. All six councillors who represent the Netherton area are members of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].\n\n==Architecture==\nThe oldest houses are to be found at the heart of the old hamlet of Netherton, clustered around the green in what is now known as Netherton Village, just north of the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]]. The old catholic [[St Benet's Chapel, Netherton|church of St. Benet]] nearby was built in 1793.<ref>[[Nikolaus Pevsner|Pevsner]], Nikolaus - The Buildings of England: South Lancashire, 1969.</ref> Unusually it appears as an ordinary house from the road with the church backing onto what was once open fields. A modern church was built over the road in the 1970s.\n\nNowadays, Netherton is formed with many modern housing, the most recent being the [[George Wimpey]] estate, completed in 2000, built just {{convert|100|yd|m|-2}} from Netherton Village green.  Housing in this part of Netherton is considered rather desirable, unlike the council-owned housing closer to the town's shopping amenities.\n\n==Education==\nNetherton is home to one secondary school, [[Savio High School]]. Formerly there was St Ambrose Barlow High School, Bootle Grammar School and Warwick Bolam County Secondary School as well as a Girl's County Secondary School. In August 2009, [[Bootle High School]] closed its doors for the last time as students transferred to [[Litherland High School]].  In December 2009, works started to demolish the school on Browns Lane.\nNow however the properties on the council estate are mostly privately owned and were bought under the [[right to buy scheme]] brought in by the conservative government under Margaret Thatcher. St Ambrose Barlow was formerly St. Catherine's Roman Catholic High School and was for girls only, also closed on 11 November 2016. The corresponding boy's school was St. Thomas Aquinas Roman Catholic High School, situated approximately on mile away on the other side of the canal.\n\n==Transport==\nNetherton is served by two railway-stations: [[Aintree railway station|Aintree]] and [[Old Roan railway station|Old Roan]], on the [[Northern Line (Merseyrail)|Northern Line]] of the [[Merseyrail]] network. The Old Roan station is technically in Aintree, but is on the border between the two areas. Old Roan bus station is next to the railway-station. Buses run from here and Magdalene Square into central [[Liverpool]] (those from Magdalene Square also serve parts of [[Bootle]]) as well as North to [[Maghull]], [[Ormskirk]] and [[Southport]].\n\nThe area is situated close to the major interchange, [[Switch Island]], at the end of the [[M57 motorway|M57]] and [[M58 motorway|M58]] motorways.\n\nThe [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]] flows through Netherton and whilst this provides a local amenity, there is very little boat traffic on this stretch of its course.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Netherton, Merseyside}}\n*[http://liverpoolstreetgallery.com/thumbnails.php?album=32 Liverpool Street Gallery - Liverpool 30]\n*[http://www.emmanuelnetherton.org Netherton Baptist Church]\n*[http://www.seftonarts.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/ Netherton Arts Centre]\n*[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit_page.jsp?u_id=10373864 Netherton on a Vision of Britain website]\n*[https://www.sefton.gov.uk/parking,-roads-travel/broom%E2%80%99s-cross-road-%28thornton-to-switch-island-link%29.aspx ]\n{{Metropolitan Borough of Sefton}}\n\n[[Category:Towns and villages in the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton]]\n", "name_user": "Babydoll9799", "label": "safe", "comment": "in Merseyside", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherton,_Merseyside"}

During the 12th century a charter was granted allowing a market, and the building of [[St. Mary's Church, Watford|St Mary's Church]] began. The town grew partly due to travellers going to [[Berkhamsted Castle]] and the royal palace at [[Kings Langley]]. A [[mansion]] was built at [[Cassiobury House|Cassiobury]] in the 16th century. This was partly rebuilt in the 17th century and another [[country house]] was built at [[The Grove, Watford|The Grove]].\n\nThe [[Grand Junction Canal]] in 1798 and the [[London and Birmingham Railway]] in 1837 resulted in Watford's rapid growth, with paper-making mills such as [[John Dickinson Stationery|John Dickinson]] at Croxley, influencing the development of printing in the town. Two brewers, [[Benskins]] and [[Sedgwicks Brewery|Sedgwicks]], amalgamated and flourished in the town until their closure in the late 20th century. [[Hertfordshire County Council]] designates Watford to be a major sub-regional centre. Several head offices  are based in Watford. Both the 2006 [[World Golf Championship]] and the [[2013 Bilderberg Conference]] took place at [[The Grove, Watford|The Grove]].<ref name=\"guardian.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/02/week-ahead-bilderberg-2013-watford|title=The week ahead: Bilderberg 2013 comes to&nbsp;... the Grove hotel, Watford|author=Charlie Skelton|work=the Guardian}}</ref>\n\nWatford became an [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]] under the [[Local Government Act 1894]] and a [[municipal borough]] by grant of a charter in 1922. The borough, which had 90,301 inhabitants at the time of the 2011 census, is separated from [[Greater London]] to the south by the parish of [[Watford Rural]] in the [[Three Rivers (district)|Three Rivers District]]. [[Watford Borough Council]] is the [[local authority]] with the [[Mayor of Watford]] as its head \u2013 one of only 18 [[directly elected mayors in England and Wales]]. Watford elects one [[Member of parliament|MP]] for the [[Watford (UK Parliament constituency)|Watford constituency]].

In the 12th century the Abbey was granted a charter allowing it to hold a market here and the building of St Mary's Church began. The settlement's location helped it to grow, since as well as trade along this north-south through route it possessed good communications into the vale of [[St Albans]] to the east and into the Chiltern Hills along the valley of the [[River Chess]] to the west. The town grew modestly, assisted by travellers passing through to [[Berkhamsted Castle]] and the royal palace at [[Kings Langley]]. A big house was built at [[Cassiobury House|Cassiobury]] in the 16th century.

The [[Industrial Revolution]] brought the [[Grand Junction Canal]] (now [[Grand Union Canal]]) from 1798 and the [[London and Birmingham Railway]] from 1837, both located here for the same reasons the road had followed centuries before, seeking an easy gradient over the Chiltern Hills. The land-owning interests permitted the canal to follow closely by the river Gade, but the prospect of smoke-emitting [[steam train]]s drove them to ensure the railway gave a wide berth to the Cassiobury and Grove estates. Consequently, although the road and canal follow the easier valley route, the railway company was forced to build an expensive tunnel under [[Leavesden, Hertfordshire|Leavesden]] to the north of the town.\n[[File:Watford, The old railway station house - geograph.org.uk - 981561.jpg|thumb|left|St Albans Road railway station  (1837)]]\n[[Watford railway station (1837-1858)|Watford's original railway station]] opened in 1837 on the west side of St Albans Road, a small, single-storey red-brick building.

The biggest printers in the town were Sun Printers Ltd and [[Odhams Press]]. Watford was the biggest printing centre in the world and many advances in printing were made in Watford.

Albans Abbey]] until the 16th century. During the 12th century a charter was granted allowing a market, and the building of [[St. Mary's Church, Watford|St Mary's Church]] began. The town grew partly due to travellers going to [[Berkhamsted Castle]] and the royal palace at [[Kings Langley]]. A [[mansion]] was built at [[Cassiobury House|Cassiobury]] in the 16th century. This was partly rebuilt in the 17th century and another [[country house]] was built at [[The Grove, Watford|The Grove]].\n\nThe [[Grand Junction Canal]] in 1798 and the [[London and Birmingham Railway]] in 1837 resulted in Watford's rapid growth, with paper-making mills such as [[John Dickinson Stationery|John Dickinson]] at Croxley, influencing the development of printing in the town. Two brewers, [[Benskins]] and [[Sedgwicks Brewery|Sedgwicks]], amalgamated and flourished in the town until their closure in the late 20th century. [[Hertfordshire County Council]] designates Watford to be a major sub-regional centre. Several head offices  are based in Watford.

In this clock, each column of LEDs shows a binary-coded decimal numeral of the traditional [[sexagesimal]] time.]]\n\nIn [[computing]] and [[electronics|electronic]] systems, '''binary-coded decimal''' ('''BCD''') is a class of [[Binary numeral system|binary]] encodings of [[decimal]] numbers where each decimal [[numerical digit|digit]] is represented by a fixed number of [[bit]]s, usually four or eight. Special bit patterns are sometimes used for a [[Sign (mathematics)|sign]] or for other indications (e.g., error or overflow).\n\nIn byte-oriented systems (i.e. most modern computers), the term ''unpacked'' BCD<ref name=\"Intel_IA32\"/> usually implies a full [[byte]] for each digit (often including a sign), whereas ''packed'' BCD typically encodes two decimal digits within a single byte by taking advantage of the fact that four bits are enough to represent the range 0 to 9. The precise 4-bit encoding may vary however, for technical reasons, see [[Excess-3]] for instance.\n\n{{anchor|Pseudo-tetrade}}The ten states representing a BCD decimal digit are sometimes called ''tetrades''<ref name=\"Klar_1970\"/><ref name=\"Klar_1989\"/> (for the [[nibble]] typically needed to hold them also known as [[tetrade (computing)|tetrade]]) with those [[don't care]]-states unused named {{Interlanguage link multi|pseudo-tetrade|de|3=Pseudotetrade|lt=''pseudo-tetrad(e)s''}},<ref name=\"Schneider_1986\"/><ref name=\"Tafel_1971\"/><ref name=\"Steinbuch-Weber_1974\"/><ref name=\"Tietze-Schenk_2013\"/><ref name=\"Kowalski_1070\"/> ''pseudo-decimals''<ref name=\"Klar_1989\"/> or ''pseudo-decimal digit''.<ref name=\"Ferretti_2013\"/><ref name=\"Speiser_1965\"/><ref group=\"nb\" name=\"Pseudo-tetrades\"/>\n\nBCD's main virtue is its more accurate representation and rounding of decimal quantities as well as an ease of conversion into human-readable representations, in comparison to binary [[positional system]]s. BCD's principal drawbacks are a small increase in the complexity of the circuits needed to implement basic arithmetic and a slightly less dense storage.\n\nBCD was used in many early [[decimal computer]]s, and is implemented in the instruction set of machines such as the [[IBM System/360]] series and its descendants, [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]'s [[VAX]], the [[Burroughs B1700]], and the Motorola [[68000]]-series processors. Although BCD ''per se'' is not as widely used as in the past and is no longer implemented in newer computers' instruction sets (such as [[ARM architecture|ARM]]; [[x86]] does not support [[Intel BCD opcode|its BCD instruction]]s in [[long mode]] any more), decimal [[Fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]] and [[floating-point]] formats are still important and continue to be used in financial, commercial, and industrial computing, where subtle conversion and [[fraction (mathematics)|fractional]] [[rounding]] [[round-off error|errors]] that are inherent in floating point binary representations cannot be tolerated.<ref name=\"Cowlishaw_GDA\"/>\n\n=={{anchor|Unpacked BCD|NBCD|8-4-2-1}}Basics==\nBCD takes advantage of the fact that any one decimal numeral can be represented by a four bit pattern. The most obvious way of encoding digits is \"natural BCD\" (NBCD), where each decimal digit is represented by its corresponding four-bit binary value, as shown in the following table. This is also called \"8421\" encoding.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Decimal digit\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"4\" | BCD\n|-\n! 8 !! 4 !! 2 !! 1\n|-\n| 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0\n|-\n| 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1\n|-\n| 2 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0\n|-\n| 3 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 1\n|-\n| 4 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0\n|-\n| 5 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 1\n|-\n| 6 || 0 || 1 || 1 || 0\n|-\n| 7 || 0 || 1 || 1 || 1\n|-\n| 8 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0\n|-\n| 9 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 1\n|}\n\nOther encodings are also used, including so-called \"4221\" and \"7421\"\u2014named after the weighting used for the bits\u2014and \"[[Excess-3]]\".<ref>{{cite book |author-last=Parag K. |author-first=Lala |title=Principles of Modern Digital Design |date=2007 |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] |isbn=978-0-470-07296-7 |pages=20\u201325 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=doNGOrHUyCoC&lpg=PA20}}</ref> For example, the BCD digit 6, '0110'b in 8421 notation, is '1100'b in 4221 (two encodings are possible), '0110'b in 7421, and '1001'b (6+3=9) in excess-3.\n\nAs most computers deal with data in 8-bit [[byte]]s, it is possible to use one of the following methods to encode a BCD number:\n* '''Unpacked''': Each decimal digit is encoded into one byte, with four bits representing the number and the remaining bits having no significance.\n* '''Packed''': Two decimal digits are encoded into a single byte, with one digit in the least significant [[nibble]] ([[Bit numbering#Most- vs least-significant bit first|bits 0 through 3]]) and the other numeral in the most significant nibble (bits 4 through 7).\n\nAs an example, encoding the decimal number <tt>'''91'''</tt> using unpacked BCD results in the following binary pattern of two bytes:\n Decimal:         9         1\n Binary : 0000 1001 0000 0001\n\nIn packed BCD, the same number would fit into a single byte:\n Decimal:    9    1\n Binary : 1001 0001\n\nHence the numerical range for one unpacked BCD byte is zero through nine inclusive, whereas the range for one packed BCD byte is zero through ninety-nine inclusive.\n\nTo represent numbers larger than the range of a single byte any number of contiguous bytes may be used. For example, to represent the decimal number <tt>'''12345'''</tt> in packed BCD, using [[big-endian]] format, a program would encode as follows:\n Decimal:    0    1    2    3    4    5\n Binary : 0000 0001 0010 0011 0100 0101\n\nHere, the most significant nibble of the most significant byte has been encoded as zero, so the number is stored as <tt>'''012345'''</tt> (but formatting routines might replace or remove leading zeros). Packed BCD is more efficient in storage usage than unpacked BCD; encoding the same number (with the leading zero) in unpacked format would consume twice the storage.\n\n[[logical shift|Shifting]] and [[mask (computing)|masking]] operations are used to pack or unpack a packed BCD digit. Other [[bitwise operation]]s are used to convert a numeral to its equivalent bit pattern or reverse the process.\n\n==BCD in electronics==\n{{Multiple issues|section=true|{{More citations needed section|date=January 2018}}{{Primary sources|section|date=January 2018}}}}\n\nBCD is very common in electronic systems where a numeric value is to be displayed, especially in systems consisting solely of digital logic, and not containing a microprocessor. By employing BCD, the manipulation of numerical data for display can be greatly simplified by treating each digit as a separate single sub-circuit. This matches much more closely the physical reality of display hardware\u2014a designer might choose to use a series of separate identical [[seven-segment display]]s to build a metering circuit, for example. If the numeric quantity were stored and manipulated as pure binary, interfacing to such a display would require complex circuitry. Therefore, in cases where the calculations are relatively simple, working throughout with BCD can lead to a simpler overall system than converting to and from binary. Most pocket calculators do all their calculations in BCD.\n\nThe same argument applies when hardware of this type uses an embedded microcontroller or other small processor. Often, smaller code results when representing numbers internally in BCD format, since a conversion from or to binary representation can be expensive on such limited processors. For these applications, some small processors feature BCD arithmetic modes, which assist when writing routines that manipulate BCD quantities.<ref>{{cite web |author=University of Alicante |title=A Cordic-based Architecture for High Performance Decimal Calculations |url=http://rua.ua.es/dspace/bitstream/10045/11826/1/VF-016519.pdf |publisher=[[IEEE]] |access-date=2015-08-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Decimal CORDIC Rotation based on Selection by Rounding: Algorithm and Architecture |url=http://faculties.sbu.ac.ir/~jaberipur/Papers/Journals/19.pdf |publisher=[[British Computer Society]] |access-date=2015-08-14}}</ref>\n\n==Packed BCD==\n<!-- Section header used in redirects -->\nIn '''packed BCD''' (or simply '''packed decimal'''), each of the two [[nibble]]s of each byte represent a decimal digit. Packed BCD has been in use since at least the 1960s and is implemented in all IBM mainframe hardware since then. Most implementations are [[big endian]], i.e. with the more significant digit in the upper half of each byte, and with the leftmost byte (residing at the lowest memory address) containing the most significant digits of the packed decimal value. The lower nibble of the rightmost byte is usually used as the sign flag, although some unsigned representations lack a sign flag. As an example, a 4-byte value consists of 8 nibbles, wherein the upper 7 nibbles store the digits of a 7-digit decimal value and the lowest nibble indicates the sign of the decimal integer value.\n\nStandard sign values are 1100 ([[hexadecimal|hex]] C) for positive (+) and 1101 (D) for negative (\u2212). This convention comes from the zone field for [[EBCDIC]] characters and the [[signed overpunch]] representation. Other allowed signs are 1010 (A) and 1110 (E) for positive and 1011 (B) for negative. IBM System/360 processors will use the 1010 (A) and 1011 (B) signs if the A bit is set in the PSW, for the ASCII-8 standard that never passed. Most implementations also provide unsigned BCD values with a sign nibble of 1111 (F).<ref name=\"IBM_POP\">{{citation |title=IBM System/370 Principles of Operation |chapter=Chapter 8: Decimal Instructions |publisher=[[IBM]] |date=March 1980 }}</ref><ref name=\"DEC_PDP11\">{{citation |title=PDP-11 Architecture Handbook |chapter=Chapter 3: Data Representation |publisher=[[Digital Equipment Corporation]] |year=1983}}</ref><ref name=\"DEC_VAX11\">{{citation |title=VAX-11 Architecture Handbook |publisher=[[Digital Equipment Corporation]] |year=1985}}</ref> ILE RPG uses 1111 (F) for positive and 1101 (D) for negative.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/iseries/v5r2/ic2924/books/c0925083170.htm |title=ILE RPG Reference}}</ref> These match the EBCDIC zone for digits without a sign overpunch. In packed BCD, the number 127 is represented by 0001 0010 0111 1100 (127C) and \u2212127 is represented by 0001 0010 0111 1101 (127D). Burroughs systems used 1101 (D) for negative, and any other value is considered a positive sign value (the processors will normalize a positive sign to 1100 (C)).\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; width:40%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e0e0e0; width:20%;\"|Sign<br>Digit\n! style=\"background:#e0e0e0; width:20%;\"|BCD<br>8&nbsp;4&nbsp;2&nbsp;1\n! style=\"background:#e0e0e0; width:20%;\"|Sign\n! style=\"background:#e0e0e0; width:40%;\"|Notes\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|A\n| 1&nbsp;0&nbsp;1&nbsp;0\n| '''+'''\n| &nbsp;\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|B\n| 1&nbsp;0&nbsp;1&nbsp;1\n| '''\u2212'''\n| &nbsp;\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|C\n| 1&nbsp;1&nbsp;0&nbsp;0\n| '''+'''\n| Preferred\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|D\n| 1&nbsp;1&nbsp;0&nbsp;1\n| '''\u2212'''\n| Preferred\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|E\n| 1&nbsp;1&nbsp;1&nbsp;0\n| '''+'''\n| &nbsp;\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|F\n| 1&nbsp;1&nbsp;1&nbsp;1\n| '''+'''\n| Unsigned\n|}\n\nNo matter how many bytes wide a [[Word (data type)|word]] is, there are always an even number of nibbles because each byte has two of them. Therefore, a word of ''n'' bytes can contain up to (2''n'')\u22121 decimal digits, which is always an odd number of digits. A decimal number with ''d'' digits requires {{sfrac|1|2}}(''d''+1) bytes of storage space.\n\nFor example, a 4-byte (32-bit) word can hold seven decimal digits plus a sign, and can represent values ranging from \u00b19,999,999. Thus the number \u22121,234,567 is 7 digits wide and is encoded as:\n 0001 0010 0011 0100 0101 0110 0111 1101\n ''1 2 3 4 5 6 7 \u2212''\n\nLike character strings, the first byte of the packed decimal{{snd}} that with the most significant two digits{{snd}} is usually stored in the lowest address in memory, independent of the [[endianness]] of the machine.\n\nIn contrast, a 4-byte binary [[two's complement]] integer can represent values from \u22122,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647.\n\nWhile packed BCD does not make optimal use of storage (about one-sixth of the memory used is wasted), conversion to [[ASCII]], [[EBCDIC]], or the various encodings of [[Unicode]] is still trivial, as no arithmetic operations are required. The extra storage requirements are usually offset by the need for the accuracy and compatibility with calculator or hand calculation that fixed-point decimal arithmetic provides. Denser packings of [[BCD (character encoding)|BCD]] exist which avoid the storage penalty and also need no arithmetic operations for common conversions.\n\nPacked BCD is supported in the [[COBOL]] programming language as the \"COMPUTATIONAL-3\" (an IBM extension adopted by many other compiler vendors) or \"PACKED-DECIMAL\" (part of the 1985 COBOL standard) data type. It is supported in [[PL/I]] as \"FIXED DECIMAL\". Besides the IBM System/360 and later compatible mainframes, packed BCD is implemented in the native instruction set of the original [[VAX]] processors from [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] and some models of the [[SDS Sigma series]] mainframes, and is the native format for the [[Burroughs Corporation]] Medium Systems line of mainframes (descended from the 1950s [[Burroughs 205|Electrodata 200 series]]).\n\n[[Ten's complement]] representations for negative numbers offer an alternative approach to encoding the sign of packed (and other) BCD numbers. In this case, positive numbers always have a most significant digit between 0 and 4 (inclusive), while negative numbers are represented by the 10's complement of the corresponding positive number. As a result, this system allows for 32-bit packed BCD numbers to range from \u221250,000,000 to +49,999,999, and \u22121 is represented as 99999999. (As with [[two's complement]] binary numbers, the range is not symmetric about zero.)\n\n===Fixed-point packed decimal===\n[[Fixed-point arithmetic|Fixed-point]] decimal numbers are supported by some programming languages (such as [[COBOL]], [[PL/I]] and [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]]). These languages allow the programmer to specify an implicit decimal point in front of one of the digits. For example, a packed decimal value encoded with the bytes 12 34 56 7C represents the fixed-point value +1,234.567 when the implied decimal point is located between the 4th and 5th digits:\n 12 34 56 7C\n ''12 34.56 7+''\n\nThe decimal point is not actually stored in memory, as the packed BCD storage format does not provide for it. Its location is simply known to the compiler and the generated code acts accordingly for the various arithmetic operations.\n\n===Higher-density encodings===\nIf a decimal digit requires four bits, then three decimal digits require 12 bits. However, since 2<sup>10</sup> (1,024) is greater than 10<sup>3</sup> (1,000), if three decimal digits are encoded together, only 10 bits are needed. Two such encodings are ''[[Chen\u2013Ho encoding]]'' and ''[[densely packed decimal]]'' (DPD). The latter has the advantage that subsets of the encoding encode two digits in the optimal seven bits and one digit in four bits, as in regular BCD.\n\n=={{anchor|Zoned BCD}}Zoned decimal==\nSome implementations, for example [[IBM]] mainframe systems, support '''zoned decimal''' numeric representations. Each decimal digit is stored in one byte, with the lower four bits encoding the digit in BCD form. The upper four bits, called the \"zone\" bits, are usually set to a fixed value so that the byte holds a character value corresponding to the digit. EBCDIC systems use a zone value of 1111 (hex F); this yields bytes in the range F0 to F9 (hex), which are the [[EBCDIC]] codes for the characters \"0\" through \"9\". Similarly, [[ASCII]] systems use a zone value of 0011 (hex 3), giving character codes 30 to 39 (hex).\n\nFor signed zoned decimal values, the rightmost (least significant) zone nibble holds the sign digit, which is the same set of values that are used for signed packed decimal numbers (see above). Thus a zoned decimal value encoded as the hex bytes F1 F2 D3 represents the signed decimal value \u2212123:\n F1 F2 D3\n '' 1 2 \u22123''\n\n===EBCDIC zoned decimal conversion table===\n<!-- Note that this table should also include codes A0-A9, B0-B9, and E0-E9 for completeness. -->\n{| style=\"margin:auto;

For example, given a six-byte signed zoned decimal value with an implied decimal point to the right of the fourth digit, the hex bytes F1 F2 F7 F9 F5 C0 represent the value +1,279.50:\n F1 F2 F7 F9 F5 C0\n '' 1 2 7 9. 5 +0''\n\n{{Anchor|IBMBCD}}<!--- keep anchor with following section, \"IBM and BCD\" --->\n\n==IBM and BCD==\n{{Main|BCDIC}}\n[[IBM]] used the terms ''[[Binary-Coded Decimal Interchange Code]]'' (BCDIC, sometimes just called BCD), for 6-bit ''[[alphanumeric]]'' codes that represented numbers, upper-case letters and special characters. Some variation of BCDIC ''alphamerics'' is used in most early IBM computers, including the [[IBM 1620]], [[IBM 1400 series]], and non-[[IBM 700/7000 series#Decimal architecture (7070/7072/7074)|Decimal Architecture]] members of the [[IBM 700/7000 series]].\n\nThe [[IBM 1400 series]] are character-addressable machines, each location being six bits labeled ''B, A, 8, 4, 2'' and ''1,'' plus an odd parity check bit (''C'') and a word mark bit (''M''). For encoding digits ''1'' through ''9'', ''B'' and ''A'' are zero and the digit value represented by standard 4-bit BCD in bits ''8'' through ''1''. For most other characters bits ''B'' and ''A'' are derived simply from the \"12\", \"11\", and \"0\" \"zone punches\" in the punched card character code, and bits ''8'' through ''1'' from the ''1'' through ''9'' punches. A \"12 zone\" punch set both ''B'' and ''A'', an \"11 zone\" set ''B'', and a \"0 zone\" (a 0 punch combined with any others) set ''A''. Thus the letter '''A''', which is ''(12,1)'' in the punched card format, is encoded ''(B,A,1)''. The currency symbol '''$''', ''(11,8,3)'' in the punched card, was encoded in memory as ''(B,8,2,1)''. This allows the circuitry to convert between the punched card format and the internal storage format to be very simple with only a few special cases. One important special case is digit ''0'', represented by a lone ''0'' punch in the card, and ''(8,2)'' in core memory.<ref>[http://ed-thelen.org/1401Project/Van1401-CodeChart.pdf IBM BM 1401/1440/1460/1410/7010 Character Code Chart in BCD Order]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe memory of the [[IBM 1620]] is organized into 6-bit addressable digits, the usual ''8, 4, 2, 1'' plus ''F'', used as a flag bit and ''C'', an odd parity check bit. BCD ''alphamerics'' are encoded using digit pairs, with the \"zone\" in the even-addressed digit and the \"digit\" in the odd-addressed digit, the \"zone\" being related to the ''12'', ''11'', and ''0'' \"zone punches\" as in the 1400 series. Input/Output translation hardware converted between the internal digit pairs and the external standard 6-bit BCD codes.\n\nIn the Decimal Architecture [[IBM 7070]], [[IBM 7072]], and [[IBM 7074]] ''alphamerics'' are encoded using digit pairs (using [[two-out-of-five code]] in the digits, '''not''' BCD) of the 10-digit word, with the \"zone\" in the left digit and the \"digit\" in the right digit. Input/Output translation hardware converted between the internal digit pairs and the external standard 6-bit BCD codes.\n\nWith the introduction of [[System/360]], IBM expanded 6-bit BCD ''alphamerics'' to 8-bit [[EBCDIC]], allowing the addition of many more characters (e.g., lowercase letters). A variable length Packed BCD ''numeric'' data type is also implemented, providing machine instructions that perform arithmetic directly on packed decimal data.\n\nOn the [[IBM 1130]] and [[IBM 1800|1800]], packed BCD is supported in software by IBM's Commercial Subroutine Package.\n\nToday, BCD data is still heavily used in IBM processors and databases, such as [[IBM DB2]], mainframes, and [[Power6]]. In these products, the BCD is usually zoned BCD (as in EBCDIC or ASCII), Packed BCD (two decimal digits per [[byte]]), or \"pure\" BCD encoding (one decimal digit stored as BCD in the low four bits of each byte). All of these are used within hardware registers and processing units, and in software. To convert packed decimals in EBCDIC table unloads to readable numbers, you can use the OUTREC FIELDS mask of the JCL utility DFSORT.<ref>http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/zos/v1r12/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.zos.r12.iceg200%2Fenf.htm{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Other computers and BCD==\nThe [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] [[VAX|VAX-11]] series includes [[Instruction set|instructions]] that can perform arithmetic directly on packed BCD data and convert between packed BCD data and other integer representations.<ref name=\"DEC_VAX11\"/> The VAX's packed BCD format is compatible with that on IBM System/360 and IBM's later compatible processors. The MicroVAX and later VAX implementations dropped this ability from the CPU but retained code compatibility with earlier machines by implementing the missing instructions in an operating system-supplied software library. This is invoked automatically via exception handling when the no longer implemented instructions are encountered, so that programs using them can execute without modification on the newer machines.\n\nThe [[Intel]] [[x86]] architecture supports a [[Intel BCD opcode|unique 18-digit (ten-byte) BCD format]] that can be loaded into and stored from the floating point registers, and computations can be performed there.<ref>{{cite book|title=Intel\u00ae 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volume 1: Basic Architecture|pages=4\u20139|date=December 2016|publisher=Intel Corporation|url=http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/architectures-software-developer-manuals.html}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Motorola 68000 series]] had BCD instructions.<ref name=\"m68k\">url=http://www.tigernt.com/onlineDoc/68000.pdf</ref>\n\nIn more recent computers such capabilities are almost always implemented in software rather than the CPU's instruction set, but BCD numeric data is still extremely common in commercial and financial applications.

Conversion of the simple sum of two digits can be done by adding 6 (that is, 16 \u2013 10) when the five-bit result of adding a pair of digits has a value greater than 9. For example:\n 1001 + 1000 = 10001\n 9 + 8 = 17\n\n10001 is the binary, not decimal, representation of the desired result, but the most-significant 1 (the \"carry\") cannot fit in a 4-bit binary number. In BCD as in decimal, there cannot exist a value greater than 9 (1001) per digit. To correct this, 6 (0110) is added to the total and then the result is treated as two [[nibble]]s:\n\n 10001 + 0110 = 00010111 => 0001 0111\n 17 + 6 = 23 1 7\n\nThe two nibbles of the result, 0001 and 0111, correspond to the digits \"1\" and \"7\". This yields \"17\" in BCD, which is the correct result.\n\nThis technique can be extended to adding multiple digits by adding in groups from right to left, propagating the second digit as a carry, always comparing the 5-bit result of each digit-pair sum to 9. Some CPUs provide a [[half-carry flag]] to facilitate BCD arithmetic adjustments following binary addition and subtraction operations.\n\n==Subtraction with BCD==\nSubtraction is done by adding the [[ten's complement]] of the [[subtrahend]] to the [[minuend]]. To represent the sign of a number in BCD, the number 0000 is used to represent a [[positive number]], and 1001 is used to represent a [[negative number]]. The remaining 14 combinations are invalid signs. To illustrate signed BCD subtraction, consider the following problem: 357 \u2212 432.\n\nIn signed BCD, 357 is 0000 0011 0101 0111. The [[ten's complement]] of 432 can be obtained by taking the [[nine's complement]] of 432, and then adding one. So, 999 \u2212 432 = 567, and 567 + 1 = 568. By preceding 568 in BCD by the negative sign code, the number \u2212432 can be represented. So, \u2212432 in signed BCD is 1001 0101 0110 1000.\n\nNow that both numbers are represented in signed BCD, they can be added together:\n 0000 0011 0101 0111\n 0 3 5 7\n + 1001 0101 0110 1000\n <u> 9 5 6 8</u>\n = 1001 1000 1011 1111\n 9 8 11 15\n\nSince BCD is a form of decimal representation, several of the digit sums above are invalid. In the event that an invalid entry (any BCD digit greater than 1001) exists, 6 is added to generate a carry bit and cause the sum to become a valid entry. The reason for adding 6 is that there are 16 possible 4-bit BCD values (since 2<sup>4</sup> = 16), but only 10 values are valid (0000 through 1001). So adding 6 to the invalid entries results in the following:\n 1001 1000 1011 1111\n 9 8 11 15\n + 0000 0000 0110 0110\n <u> 0 0 6 6</u>\n = 1001 1001 0010 0101\n 9 9 2 5\n\nThus the result of the subtraction is 1001 1001 0010 0101 (\u2212925). To confirm the result, note that the first digit is 9, which means negative. This seems to be correct, since 357 \u2212 432 should result in a negative number. The remaining nibbles are BCD, so 1001 0010 0101 is 925. The [[ten's complement]] of 925 is 1000 \u2212 925 = 75, so the calculated answer is \u221275.\n\nIf there are a different number of nibbles being added together (such as 1053 \u2212 2), the number with the fewer digits must first be prefixed with zeros before taking the [[ten's complement]] or subtracting. So, with 1053 \u2212 2, 2 would have to first be represented as 0002 in BCD, and the [[ten's complement]] of 0002 would have to be calculated.\n\n==Background==\nThe binary-coded decimal scheme described in this article is the most common encoding, but there are many others. The method here can be referred to as ''Simple Binary-Coded Decimal'' (''SBCD'') or ''BCD&nbsp;8421''.\n<!-- It is also sometimes named ''NBCD'' (''Naturally Binary-Coded Decimal'').

This was an important case in determining the patentability of software and algorithms.\n\n==Comparison with pure binary==\n<!-- not at all clear why this needs to be here at all, shouldn't the article just describe BCD? (mfc)-->\n<!--as an alternative number system for computing and electronics imo a comparison to the standard one is justified (plugwash)-->\n\n===Advantages===\n* Many non-integral values, such as decimal 0.2, have an infinite place-value representation in binary (.001100110011...) but have a finite place-value in binary-coded decimal (0.0010). Consequently, a system based on binary-coded decimal representations of decimal fractions avoids errors representing and calculating such values. This is useful in financial calculations.\n* Scaling by a power of 10 is simple.\n* [[Rounding]] at a decimal digit boundary is simpler. Addition and subtraction in decimal does not require rounding.\n* Alignment of two decimal numbers (for example 1.3 + 27.08) is a simple, exact, shift.\n* Conversion to a character form or for display (e.g., to a text-based format such as [[XML]], or to drive signals for a [[seven-segment display]]) is a simple per-digit mapping, and can be done in linear ([[Big-O notation|O]](''n'')) time. Conversion from pure [[binary numeral system|binary]] involves relatively complex logic that spans digits, and for large numbers no linear-time conversion algorithm is known (see {{see section|Binary numeral system|Conversion to and from other numeral systems}}).\n\n===Disadvantages===\n* Some operations are more complex to implement. [[Adder (electronics)|Adder]]s require extra logic to cause them to wrap and generate a carry early. 15 to 20 percent more circuitry is needed for BCD add compared to pure binary.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Multiplication requires the use of algorithms that are somewhat more complex than shift-mask-add (a [[Binary numeral system#Multiplication|binary multiplication]], requiring binary shifts and adds or the equivalent, per-digit or group of digits is required)\n* Standard BCD requires four bits per digit, roughly 20 percent more space than a binary encoding (the ratio of 4 bits to log<sub>2</sub>10 bits is 1.204). When packed so that three digits are encoded in ten bits, the storage overhead is greatly reduced, at the expense of an encoding that is unaligned with the 8-bit byte boundaries common on existing hardware, resulting in slower implementations on these systems.<!-- Could add: encoding or decoding is trivial in software using a table lookup, and fast using direct logic otherwise. In hardware it requires no more than three gate delays. -->\n* Practical existing implementations of BCD are typically slower than operations on binary representations, especially on embedded systems, due to limited processor support for native BCD operations.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mathur|first=A.

This form is easily converted into ASCII for display.<ref>http://www.se.ecu.edu.au/units/ens1242/lectures/ens_Notes_08.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><!-- also see MC6818 datasheet -->\n\nThe [[Atari 8-bit family]] of computers used BCD to implement floating-point algorithms. The [[MOS Technology 6502|MOS 6502]] processor has a BCD mode that affects the addition and subtraction instructions. The [[Psion Organiser|Psion Organiser 1]] handheld computer's manufacturer-supplied software also used entirely BCD to implement floating point; later Psion models used binary exclusively.\n\nEarly models of the [[PlayStation 3]] store the date and time in BCD. This led to a worldwide outage of the console on 1 March 2010. The last two digits of the year stored as BCD [[time formatting and storage bugs|were misinterpreted]] as 16 causing an error in the unit's date, rendering most functions inoperable. This has been referred to as the [[Year 2010 problem|Year 2010 Problem]].\n\n==Representational variations==\nVarious BCD implementations exist that employ other representations for numbers. [[Programmable calculator]]s manufactured by [[Texas Instruments]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], and others typically employ a [[floating-point]] BCD format, typically with two or three digits for the (decimal) exponent. The extra bits of the sign digit may be used to indicate special numeric values, such as [[infinity]], [[arithmetic underflow|underflow]]/[[arithmetic overflow|overflow]], and [[Defined and undefined|error]] (a blinking display).\n\n===Signed variations===\nSigned decimal values may be represented in several ways. The [[COBOL]] programming language, for example, supports a total of five zoned decimal formats, each one encoding the numeric sign in a different way:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#D0E0FF; width:25%\"| Type\n! style=\"background:#D0E0FF; width:55%\"| Description\n! style=\"background:#D0E0FF; width:20%\"| Example\n|-\n| Unsigned\n| No sign nibble\n| <code>F1 F2 <u>F</u>3</code>\n|-\n| Signed trailing ''(canonical format)''\n| Sign nibble in the last (least significant) byte\n| <code>F1 F2 <u>C</u>3</code>\n|-\n| Signed leading ''(overpunch)''\n| Sign nibble in the first (most significant) byte\n| <code><u>C</u>1 F2 F3</code>\n|-\n| Signed trailing separate\n| Separate sign character byte (<code>'+'</code> or <code>'\u2212'</code>) following the digit bytes\n| <code>F1 F2 F3 <u>2B</u></code>\n|-\n| Signed leading separate\n| Separate sign character byte (<code>'+'</code> or <code>'\u2212'</code>) preceding the digit bytes\n| <code><u>2B</u> F1 F2 F3</code>\n|}\n\n==={{anchor|TBCD}}Telephony Binary Coded Decimal (TBCD)===\n[[3GPP]] developed '''TBCD''',<ref>{{cite techreport |title=3GPP TS 29.002: Mobile Application Part (MAP) specification |at=sec. 17.7.8 Common data types |year=2013 |url=http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/29002.htm}}</ref> an expansion to BCD where the remaining (unused) bit combinations are used to add specific [[telephony]] characters,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_etr/001_099/060/02_60/etr_060e02p.pdf |title=Signalling Protocols and Switching (SPS) Guidelines for using Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) in telecommunication application protocols |page=15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.openss7.org/specs/xmap.pdf |title=XOM Mobile Application Part (XMAP) Specification |page=93 |access-date=27 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221103429/http://www.openss7.org/specs/xmap.pdf |archive-date=21 February 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> with digits similar to those found in [[Dual-tone multi-frequency signaling|telephone keypads]] original design.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:30%; text-align:center\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#E0E0E0; width:50%\" |Decimal<br/>Digit\n! style=\"background:#E0E0E0; width:50%\" |TBCD<br/>8 4 2 1\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F0F0F0\" |*\n| 1 0 1 0\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F0F0F0\" |#\n| 1 0 1 1\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F0F0F0\" |a\n| 1 1 0 0\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F0F0F0\" |b\n| 1 1 0 1\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F0F0F0\" |c\n| 1 1 1 0\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F0F0F0\" |Used as filler when there is an odd number of digits\n| 1 1 1 1\n|}\n\nThe mentioned 3GPP document defines '''TBCD-STRING''' with swapped nibbles in each byte.

For example, 0.2 can be represented as 2{{e|-1}}.\n\nThis representation allows rapid multiplication and division, but may require shifting by a power of 10 during addition and subtraction to align the decimal points. It is appropriate for applications with a fixed number of decimal places that do not then require this adjustment\u2014particularly financial applications where 2 or 4 digits after the decimal point are usually enough. Indeed, this is almost a form of [[fixed point arithmetic]] since the position of the [[radix point]] is implied.\n\n[[Chen\u2013Ho encoding]] provides a boolean transformation for converting groups of three BCD-encoded digits to and from 10-bit values that can be efficiently encoded in hardware with only 2 or 3 gate delays. [[Densely packed decimal]] (DPD) is a similar scheme that is used for most of the [[significand]], except the lead digit, for one of the two alternative decimal encodings specified in the [[IEEE 754-2008]] standard.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bi-quinary coded decimal]]\n* [[Binary integer decimal]] (BID)\n* [[Chen\u2013Ho encoding]]\n* [[Densely packed decimal]] (DPD)\n* [[Double dabble]], an algorithm for converting binary numbers to BCD\n* [[Gray code]]\n* [[Year 2000 problem]]\n* [[Decimal computer]]\n* [[Binary-coded ternary]] (BCT)\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=\"nb\"|refs=\n<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"Pseudo-tetrades\">That is, in a standard packed 4-bit representation, there are 16 states (four bits for each digit) with 10 tetrades and 6 pseudo-tetrades, whereas in more densely packed schemes such as [[Chen\u2013Ho encoding|Chen\u2013Ho]] or [[densely packed decimal|DPD]] coding there are fewer--e.g., only 24 pseudo-tetrades in 1024 states (10 bits for three digits).</ref>\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Intel_IA32\">{{cite web |author=Intel |title=ia32 architecture manual |url=http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developers-manual.pdf |publisher=[[Intel]] |access-date=2015-07-01}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Schneider_1986\">{{cite book |title=Lexikon der Informatik und Datenverarbeitung |language=German |author-first=Hans-Jochen |author-last=Schneider |date=1986 |edition=2 |publisher=R.

In this clock, each column of LEDs shows a binary-coded decimal numeral of the traditional [[sexagesimal]] time.]]\n\nIn [[computing]] and [[electronics|electronic]] systems, '''binary-coded decimal''' ('''BCD''') is a class of [[Binary numeral system|binary]] encodings of [[decimal]] numbers where each decimal [[numerical digit|digit]] is represented by a fixed number of [[bit]]s, usually four or eight. Special bit patterns are sometimes used for a [[Sign (mathematics)|sign]] or for other indications (e.g., error or overflow).\n\nIn byte-oriented systems (i.e. most modern computers), the term ''unpacked'' BCD<ref name=\"Intel_IA32\"/> usually implies a full [[byte]] for each digit (often including a sign), whereas ''packed'' BCD typically encodes two decimal digits within a single byte by taking advantage of the fact that four bits are enough to represent the range 0 to 9. The precise 4-bit encoding may vary however, for technical reasons, see [[Excess-3]] for instance.\n\n{{anchor|Pseudo-tetrade}}The ten states representing a BCD decimal digit are sometimes called ''tetrades''<ref name=\"Klar_1970\"/><ref name=\"Klar_1989\"/> (for the [[nibble]] typically needed to hold them also known as [[tetrade (computing)|tetrade]]) with those [[don't care]]-states unused named {{Interlanguage link multi|pseudo-tetrade|de|3=Pseudotetrade|lt=''pseudo-tetrad(e)s''}}<ref name=\"Schneider_1986\"/><ref name=\"Tafel_1971\"/><ref name=\"Steinbuch-Weber_1974\"/><ref name=\"Tietze-Schenk_2013\"/><ref name=\"Kowalski_1070\"/>, ''pseudo-decimals''<ref name=\"Klar_1989\"/> or ''pseudo-decimal digit''.<ref name=\"Ferretti_2013\"/><ref name=\"Speiser_1965\"/><ref group=\"nb\" name=\"Pseudo-tetrades\"/>\n\nBCD's main virtue is its more accurate representation and rounding of decimal quantities as well as an ease of conversion into human-readable representations, in comparison to binary [[positional system]]s. BCD's principal drawbacks are a small increase in the complexity of the circuits needed to implement basic arithmetic and a slightly less dense storage.\n\nBCD was used in many early [[decimal computer]]s, and is implemented in the instruction set of machines such as the [[IBM System/360]] series and its descendants, [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]'s [[VAX]], the [[Burroughs B1700]], and the Motorola [[68000]]-series processors. Although BCD ''per se'' is not as widely used as in the past and is no longer implemented in newer computers' instruction sets (such as [[ARM architecture|ARM]]; [[x86]] does not support [[Intel BCD opcode|its BCD instruction]]s in [[long mode]] any more), decimal [[Fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]] and [[floating-point]] formats are still important and continue to be used in financial, commercial, and industrial computing, where subtle conversion and [[fraction (mathematics)|fractional]] [[rounding]] [[round-off error|errors]] that are inherent in floating point binary representations cannot be tolerated.<ref name=\"Cowlishaw_GDA\"/>\n\n=={{anchor|Unpacked BCD|NBCD|8-4-2-1}}Basics==\nBCD takes advantage of the fact that any one decimal numeral can be represented by a four bit pattern. The most obvious way of encoding digits is \"natural BCD\" (NBCD), where each decimal digit is represented by its corresponding four-bit binary value, as shown in the following table. This is also called \"8421\" encoding.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Decimal digit\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"4\" | BCD\n|-\n! 8 !! 4 !! 2 !! 1\n|-\n| 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0\n|-\n| 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1\n|-\n| 2 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0\n|-\n| 3 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 1\n|-\n| 4 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0\n|-\n| 5 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 1\n|-\n| 6 || 0 || 1 || 1 || 0\n|-\n| 7 || 0 || 1 || 1 || 1\n|-\n| 8 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0\n|-\n| 9 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 1\n|}\n\nOther encodings are also used, including so-called \"4221\" and \"7421\"\u2014named after the weighting used for the bits\u2014and \"[[Excess-3]]\".<ref>{{cite book |author-last=Parag K. |author-first=Lala |title=Principles of Modern Digital Design |date=2007 |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] |isbn=978-0-470-07296-7 |pages=20\u201325 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=doNGOrHUyCoC&lpg=PA20}}</ref> For example, the BCD digit 6, '0110'b in 8421 notation, is '1100'b in 4221 (two encodings are possible), '0110'b in 7421, and '1001'b (6+3=9) in excess-3.\n\nAs most computers deal with data in 8-bit [[byte]]s, it is possible to use one of the following methods to encode a BCD number:\n* '''Unpacked''': Each decimal digit is encoded into one byte, with four bits representing the number and the remaining bits having no significance.\n* '''Packed''': Two decimal digits are encoded into a single byte, with one digit in the least significant [[nibble]] ([[Bit numbering#Most- vs least-significant bit first|bits 0 through 3]]) and the other numeral in the most significant nibble (bits 4 through 7).\n\nAs an example, encoding the decimal number <tt>'''91'''</tt> using unpacked BCD results in the following binary pattern of two bytes:\n Decimal:         9         1\n Binary : 0000 1001 0000 0001\n\nIn packed BCD, the same number would fit into a single byte:\n Decimal:    9    1\n Binary : 1001 0001\n\nHence the numerical range for one unpacked BCD byte is zero through nine inclusive, whereas the range for one packed BCD byte is zero through ninety-nine inclusive.\n\nTo represent numbers larger than the range of a single byte any number of contiguous bytes may be used. For example, to represent the decimal number <tt>'''12345'''</tt> in packed BCD, using [[big-endian]] format, a program would encode as follows:\n Decimal:    0    1    2    3    4    5\n Binary : 0000 0001 0010 0011 0100 0101\n\nHere, the most significant nibble of the most significant byte has been encoded as zero, so the number is stored as <tt>'''012345'''</tt> (but formatting routines might replace or remove leading zeros). Packed BCD is more efficient in storage usage than unpacked BCD; encoding the same number (with the leading zero) in unpacked format would consume twice the storage.\n\n[[logical shift|Shifting]] and [[mask (computing)|masking]] operations are used to pack or unpack a packed BCD digit. Other [[bitwise operation]]s are used to convert a numeral to its equivalent bit pattern or reverse the process.\n\n==BCD in electronics==\n{{Multiple issues|section=true|{{More citations needed section|date=January 2018}}{{Primary sources|section|date=January 2018}}}}\n\nBCD is very common in electronic systems where a numeric value is to be displayed, especially in systems consisting solely of digital logic, and not containing a microprocessor. By employing BCD, the manipulation of numerical data for display can be greatly simplified by treating each digit as a separate single sub-circuit. This matches much more closely the physical reality of display hardware\u2014a designer might choose to use a series of separate identical [[seven-segment display]]s to build a metering circuit, for example. If the numeric quantity were stored and manipulated as pure binary, interfacing to such a display would require complex circuitry. Therefore, in cases where the calculations are relatively simple, working throughout with BCD can lead to a simpler overall system than converting to and from binary. Most pocket calculators do all their calculations in BCD.\n\nThe same argument applies when hardware of this type uses an embedded microcontroller or other small processor. Often, smaller code results when representing numbers internally in BCD format, since a conversion from or to binary representation can be expensive on such limited processors. For these applications, some small processors feature BCD arithmetic modes, which assist when writing routines that manipulate BCD quantities.<ref>{{cite web |author=University of Alicante |title=A Cordic-based Architecture for High Performance Decimal Calculations |url=http://rua.ua.es/dspace/bitstream/10045/11826/1/VF-016519.pdf |publisher=[[IEEE]] |access-date=2015-08-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Decimal CORDIC Rotation based on Selection by Rounding: Algorithm and Architecture |url=http://faculties.sbu.ac.ir/~jaberipur/Papers/Journals/19.pdf |publisher=[[British Computer Society]] |access-date=2015-08-14}}</ref>\n\n==Packed BCD==\n<!-- Section header used in redirects -->\nIn '''packed BCD''' (or simply '''packed decimal'''), each of the two [[nibble]]s of each byte represent a decimal digit. Packed BCD has been in use since at least the 1960s and is implemented in all IBM mainframe hardware since then. Most implementations are [[big endian]], i.e. with the more significant digit in the upper half of each byte, and with the leftmost byte (residing at the lowest memory address) containing the most significant digits of the packed decimal value. The lower nibble of the rightmost byte is usually used as the sign flag, although some unsigned representations lack a sign flag. As an example, a 4-byte value consists of 8 nibbles, wherein the upper 7 nibbles store the digits of a 7-digit decimal value and the lowest nibble indicates the sign of the decimal integer value.\n\nStandard sign values are 1100 ([[hexadecimal|hex]] C) for positive (+) and 1101 (D) for negative (\u2212). This convention comes from the zone field for [[EBCDIC]] characters and the [[signed overpunch]] representation. Other allowed signs are 1010 (A) and 1110 (E) for positive and 1011 (B) for negative. IBM System/360 processors will use the 1010 (A) and 1011 (B) signs if the A bit is set in the PSW, for the ASCII-8 standard that never passed. Most implementations also provide unsigned BCD values with a sign nibble of 1111 (F).<ref name=\"IBM_POP\">{{citation |title=IBM System/370 Principles of Operation |chapter=Chapter 8: Decimal Instructions |publisher=[[IBM]] |date=March 1980 }}</ref><ref name=\"DEC_PDP11\">{{citation |title=PDP-11 Architecture Handbook |chapter=Chapter 3: Data Representation |publisher=[[Digital Equipment Corporation]] |year=1983}}</ref><ref name=\"DEC_VAX11\">{{citation |title=VAX-11 Architecture Handbook |publisher=[[Digital Equipment Corporation]] |year=1985}}</ref> ILE RPG uses 1111 (F) for positive and 1101 (D) for negative.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/iseries/v5r2/ic2924/books/c0925083170.htm |title=ILE RPG Reference}}</ref> These match the EBCDIC zone for digits without a sign overpunch. In packed BCD, the number 127 is represented by 0001 0010 0111 1100 (127C) and \u2212127 is represented by 0001 0010 0111 1101 (127D). Burroughs systems used 1101 (D) for negative, and any other value is considered a positive sign value (the processors will normalize a positive sign to 1100 (C)).\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; width:40%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e0e0e0; width:20%;\"|Sign<br>Digit\n! style=\"background:#e0e0e0; width:20%;\"|BCD<br>8&nbsp;4&nbsp;2&nbsp;1\n! style=\"background:#e0e0e0; width:20%;\"|Sign\n! style=\"background:#e0e0e0; width:40%;\"|Notes\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|A\n| 1&nbsp;0&nbsp;1&nbsp;0\n| '''+'''\n| &nbsp;\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|B\n| 1&nbsp;0&nbsp;1&nbsp;1\n| '''\u2212'''\n| &nbsp;\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|C\n| 1&nbsp;1&nbsp;0&nbsp;0\n| '''+'''\n| Preferred\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|D\n| 1&nbsp;1&nbsp;0&nbsp;1\n| '''\u2212'''\n| Preferred\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|E\n| 1&nbsp;1&nbsp;1&nbsp;0\n| '''+'''\n| &nbsp;\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|F\n| 1&nbsp;1&nbsp;1&nbsp;1\n| '''+'''\n| Unsigned\n|}\n\nNo matter how many bytes wide a [[Word (data type)|word]] is, there are always an even number of nibbles because each byte has two of them. Therefore, a word of ''n'' bytes can contain up to (2''n'')\u22121 decimal digits, which is always an odd number of digits. A decimal number with ''d'' digits requires {{sfrac|1|2}}(''d''+1) bytes of storage space.\n\nFor example, a 4-byte (32-bit) word can hold seven decimal digits plus a sign, and can represent values ranging from \u00b19,999,999. Thus the number \u22121,234,567 is 7 digits wide and is encoded as:\n 0001 0010 0011 0100 0101 0110 0111 1101\n ''1 2 3 4 5 6 7 \u2212''\n\nLike character strings, the first byte of the packed decimal{{snd}} that with the most significant two digits{{snd}} is usually stored in the lowest address in memory, independent of the [[endianness]] of the machine.\n\nIn contrast, a 4-byte binary [[two's complement]] integer can represent values from \u22122,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647.\n\nWhile packed BCD does not make optimal use of storage (about one-sixth of the memory used is wasted), conversion to [[ASCII]], [[EBCDIC]], or the various encodings of [[Unicode]] is still trivial, as no arithmetic operations are required. The extra storage requirements are usually offset by the need for the accuracy and compatibility with calculator or hand calculation that fixed-point decimal arithmetic provides. Denser packings of [[BCD (character encoding)|BCD]] exist which avoid the storage penalty and also need no arithmetic operations for common conversions.\n\nPacked BCD is supported in the [[COBOL]] programming language as the \"COMPUTATIONAL-3\" (an IBM extension adopted by many other compiler vendors) or \"PACKED-DECIMAL\" (part of the 1985 COBOL standard) data type. It is supported in [[PL/I]] as \"FIXED DECIMAL\". Besides the IBM System/360 and later compatible mainframes, packed BCD is implemented in the native instruction set of the original [[VAX]] processors from [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] and some models of the [[SDS Sigma series]] mainframes, and is the native format for the [[Burroughs Corporation]] Medium Systems line of mainframes (descended from the 1950s [[Burroughs 205|Electrodata 200 series]]).\n\n[[Ten's complement]] representations for negative numbers offer an alternative approach to encoding the sign of packed (and other) BCD numbers. In this case, positive numbers always have a most significant digit between 0 and 4 (inclusive), while negative numbers are represented by the 10's complement of the corresponding positive number. As a result, this system allows for 32-bit packed BCD numbers to range from \u221250,000,000 to +49,999,999, and \u22121 is represented as 99999999. (As with [[two's complement]] binary numbers, the range is not symmetric about zero.)\n\n===Fixed-point packed decimal===\n[[Fixed-point arithmetic|Fixed-point]] decimal numbers are supported by some programming languages (such as [[COBOL]], [[PL/I]] and [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]]). These languages allow the programmer to specify an implicit decimal point in front of one of the digits. For example, a packed decimal value encoded with the bytes 12 34 56 7C represents the fixed-point value +1,234.567 when the implied decimal point is located between the 4th and 5th digits:\n 12 34 56 7C\n ''12 34.56 7+''\n\nThe decimal point is not actually stored in memory, as the packed BCD storage format does not provide for it. Its location is simply known to the compiler and the generated code acts accordingly for the various arithmetic operations.\n\n===Higher-density encodings===\nIf a decimal digit requires four bits, then three decimal digits require 12 bits. However, since 2<sup>10</sup> (1,024) is greater than 10<sup>3</sup> (1,000), if three decimal digits are encoded together, only 10 bits are needed. Two such encodings are ''[[Chen\u2013Ho encoding]]'' and ''[[densely packed decimal]]'' (DPD). The latter has the advantage that subsets of the encoding encode two digits in the optimal seven bits and one digit in four bits, as in regular BCD.\n\n=={{anchor|Zoned BCD}}Zoned decimal==\nSome implementations, for example [[IBM]] mainframe systems, support '''zoned decimal''' numeric representations. Each decimal digit is stored in one byte, with the lower four bits encoding the digit in BCD form. The upper four bits, called the \"zone\" bits, are usually set to a fixed value so that the byte holds a character value corresponding to the digit. EBCDIC systems use a zone value of 1111 (hex F); this yields bytes in the range F0 to F9 (hex), which are the [[EBCDIC]] codes for the characters \"0\" through \"9\". Similarly, [[ASCII]] systems use a zone value of 0011 (hex 3), giving character codes 30 to 39 (hex).\n\nFor signed zoned decimal values, the rightmost (least significant) zone nibble holds the sign digit, which is the same set of values that are used for signed packed decimal numbers (see above). Thus a zoned decimal value encoded as the hex bytes F1 F2 D3 represents the signed decimal value \u2212123:\n F1 F2 D3\n '' 1 2 \u22123''\n\n===EBCDIC zoned decimal conversion table===\n<!-- Note that this table should also include codes A0-A9, B0-B9, and E0-E9 for completeness. -->\n{| style=\"margin:auto;

For example, given a six-byte signed zoned decimal value with an implied decimal point to the right of the fourth digit, the hex bytes F1 F2 F7 F9 F5 C0 represent the value +1,279.50:\n F1 F2 F7 F9 F5 C0\n '' 1 2 7 9. 5 +0''\n\n{{Anchor|IBMBCD}}<!--- keep anchor with following section, \"IBM and BCD\" --->\n\n==IBM and BCD==\n{{Main|BCDIC}}\n[[IBM]] used the terms ''[[Binary-Coded Decimal Interchange Code]]'' (BCDIC, sometimes just called BCD), for 6-bit ''[[alphanumeric]]'' codes that represented numbers, upper-case letters and special characters. Some variation of BCDIC ''alphamerics'' is used in most early IBM computers, including the [[IBM 1620]], [[IBM 1400 series]], and non-[[IBM 700/7000 series#Decimal architecture (7070/7072/7074)|Decimal Architecture]] members of the [[IBM 700/7000 series]].\n\nThe [[IBM 1400 series]] are character-addressable machines, each location being six bits labeled ''B, A, 8, 4, 2'' and ''1,'' plus an odd parity check bit (''C'') and a word mark bit (''M''). For encoding digits ''1'' through ''9'', ''B'' and ''A'' are zero and the digit value represented by standard 4-bit BCD in bits ''8'' through ''1''. For most other characters bits ''B'' and ''A'' are derived simply from the \"12\", \"11\", and \"0\" \"zone punches\" in the punched card character code, and bits ''8'' through ''1'' from the ''1'' through ''9'' punches. A \"12 zone\" punch set both ''B'' and ''A'', an \"11 zone\" set ''B'', and a \"0 zone\" (a 0 punch combined with any others) set ''A''. Thus the letter '''A''', which is ''(12,1)'' in the punched card format, is encoded ''(B,A,1)''. The currency symbol '''$''', ''(11,8,3)'' in the punched card, was encoded in memory as ''(B,8,2,1)''. This allows the circuitry to convert between the punched card format and the internal storage format to be very simple with only a few special cases. One important special case is digit ''0'', represented by a lone ''0'' punch in the card, and ''(8,2)'' in core memory.<ref>[http://ed-thelen.org/1401Project/Van1401-CodeChart.pdf IBM BM 1401/1440/1460/1410/7010 Character Code Chart in BCD Order]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe memory of the [[IBM 1620]] is organized into 6-bit addressable digits, the usual ''8, 4, 2, 1'' plus ''F'', used as a flag bit and ''C'', an odd parity check bit. BCD ''alphamerics'' are encoded using digit pairs, with the \"zone\" in the even-addressed digit and the \"digit\" in the odd-addressed digit, the \"zone\" being related to the ''12'', ''11'', and ''0'' \"zone punches\" as in the 1400 series. Input/Output translation hardware converted between the internal digit pairs and the external standard 6-bit BCD codes.\n\nIn the Decimal Architecture [[IBM 7070]], [[IBM 7072]], and [[IBM 7074]] ''alphamerics'' are encoded using digit pairs (using [[two-out-of-five code]] in the digits, '''not''' BCD) of the 10-digit word, with the \"zone\" in the left digit and the \"digit\" in the right digit. Input/Output translation hardware converted between the internal digit pairs and the external standard 6-bit BCD codes.\n\nWith the introduction of [[System/360]], IBM expanded 6-bit BCD ''alphamerics'' to 8-bit [[EBCDIC]], allowing the addition of many more characters (e.g., lowercase letters). A variable length Packed BCD ''numeric'' data type is also implemented, providing machine instructions that perform arithmetic directly on packed decimal data.\n\nOn the [[IBM 1130]] and [[IBM 1800|1800]], packed BCD is supported in software by IBM's Commercial Subroutine Package.\n\nToday, BCD data is still heavily used in IBM processors and databases, such as [[IBM DB2]], mainframes, and [[Power6]]. In these products, the BCD is usually zoned BCD (as in EBCDIC or ASCII), Packed BCD (two decimal digits per [[byte]]), or \"pure\" BCD encoding (one decimal digit stored as BCD in the low four bits of each byte). All of these are used within hardware registers and processing units, and in software. To convert packed decimals in EBCDIC table unloads to readable numbers, you can use the OUTREC FIELDS mask of the JCL utility DFSORT.<ref>http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/zos/v1r12/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.zos.r12.iceg200%2Fenf.htm{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Other computers and BCD==\nThe [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] [[VAX|VAX-11]] series includes [[Instruction set|instructions]] that can perform arithmetic directly on packed BCD data and convert between packed BCD data and other integer representations.<ref name=\"DEC_VAX11\"/> The VAX's packed BCD format is compatible with that on IBM System/360 and IBM's later compatible processors. The MicroVAX and later VAX implementations dropped this ability from the CPU but retained code compatibility with earlier machines by implementing the missing instructions in an operating system-supplied software library. This is invoked automatically via exception handling when the no longer implemented instructions are encountered, so that programs using them can execute without modification on the newer machines.\n\nThe [[Intel]] [[x86]] architecture supports a [[Intel BCD opcode|unique 18-digit (ten-byte) BCD format]] that can be loaded into and stored from the floating point registers, and computations can be performed there.<ref>{{cite book|title=Intel\u00ae 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volume 1: Basic Architecture|pages=4\u20139|date=December 2016|publisher=Intel Corporation|url=http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/architectures-software-developer-manuals.html}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Motorola 68000 series]] had BCD instructions.<ref name=\"m68k\">url=http://www.tigernt.com/onlineDoc/68000.pdf</ref>\n\nIn more recent computers such capabilities are almost always implemented in software rather than the CPU's instruction set, but BCD numeric data is still extremely common in commercial and financial applications. There are tricks for implementing packed BCD and zoned decimal add or subtract operations using short but difficult to understand sequences of word-parallel logic and binary arithmetic operations.<ref name=\"Jones_AT\">{{cite web |title=BCD Arithmetic, a tutorial |work=Arithmetic Tutorials |author-first=Douglas W. |author-last=Jones |author-link=Douglas W.

Conversion of the simple sum of two digits can be done by adding 6 (that is, 16 \u2013 10) when the five-bit result of adding a pair of digits has a value greater than 9. For example:\n 1001 + 1000 = 10001\n 9 + 8 = 17\n\n10001 is the binary, not decimal, representation of the desired result, but the most-significant 1 (the \"carry\") cannot fit in a 4-bit binary number. In BCD as in decimal, there cannot exist a value greater than 9 (1001) per digit. To correct this, 6 (0110) is added to the total and then the result is treated as two [[nibble]]s:\n\n 10001 + 0110 = 00010111 => 0001 0111\n 17 + 6 = 23 1 7\n\nThe two nibbles of the result, 0001 and 0111, correspond to the digits \"1\" and \"7\". This yields \"17\" in BCD, which is the correct result.\n\nThis technique can be extended to adding multiple digits by adding in groups from right to left, propagating the second digit as a carry, always comparing the 5-bit result of each digit-pair sum to 9. Some CPUs provide a [[half-carry flag]] to facilitate BCD arithmetic adjustments following binary addition and subtraction operations.\n\n==Subtraction with BCD==\nSubtraction is done by adding the [[ten's complement]] of the [[subtrahend]] to the [[minuend]]. To represent the sign of a number in BCD, the number 0000 is used to represent a [[positive number]], and 1001 is used to represent a [[negative number]]. The remaining 14 combinations are invalid signs. To illustrate signed BCD subtraction, consider the following problem: 357 \u2212 432.\n\nIn signed BCD, 357 is 0000 0011 0101 0111. The [[ten's complement]] of 432 can be obtained by taking the [[nine's complement]] of 432, and then adding one. So, 999 \u2212 432 = 567, and 567 + 1 = 568. By preceding 568 in BCD by the negative sign code, the number \u2212432 can be represented. So, \u2212432 in signed BCD is 1001 0101 0110 1000.\n\nNow that both numbers are represented in signed BCD, they can be added together:\n 0000 0011 0101 0111\n 0 3 5 7\n + 1001 0101 0110 1000\n <u> 9 5 6 8</u>\n = 1001 1000 1011 1111\n 9 8 11 15\n\nSince BCD is a form of decimal representation, several of the digit sums above are invalid. In the event that an invalid entry (any BCD digit greater than 1001) exists, 6 is added to generate a carry bit and cause the sum to become a valid entry. The reason for adding 6 is that there are 16 possible 4-bit BCD values (since 2<sup>4</sup> = 16), but only 10 values are valid (0000 through 1001). So adding 6 to the invalid entries results in the following:\n 1001 1000 1011 1111\n 9 8 11 15\n + 0000 0000 0110 0110\n <u> 0 0 6 6</u>\n = 1001 1001 0010 0101\n 9 9 2 5\n\nThus the result of the subtraction is 1001 1001 0010 0101 (\u2212925). To confirm the result, note that the first digit is 9, which means negative. This seems to be correct, since 357 \u2212 432 should result in a negative number. The remaining nibbles are BCD, so 1001 0010 0101 is 925. The [[ten's complement]] of 925 is 1000 \u2212 925 = 75, so the calculated answer is \u221275.\n\nIf there are a different number of nibbles being added together (such as 1053 \u2212 2), the number with the fewer digits must first be prefixed with zeros before taking the [[ten's complement]] or subtracting. So, with 1053 \u2212 2, 2 would have to first be represented as 0002 in BCD, and the [[ten's complement]] of 0002 would have to be calculated.\n\n==Background==\nThe binary-coded decimal scheme described in this article is the most common encoding, but there are many others. The method here can be referred to as ''Simple Binary-Coded Decimal'' (''SBCD'') or ''BCD&nbsp;8421''.\n<!-- It is also sometimes named ''NBCD'' (''Naturally Binary-Coded Decimal''). (where?) -->\nThe following table represents [[decimal]] digits from 0 to 9 in various BCD systems. \nIn the headers to the table, the '{{code|8 4 2 1}}', indicates the weight of each bit shown; in the fifth column, \"BCD&nbsp;8&nbsp;4&nbsp;\u22122&nbsp;\u22121\", two of the weights are negative. Both ASCII and EBCDIC character codes for the digits are examples of zoned BCD, and are also shown in the table.\n\n:\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\"| &nbsp;<br />Digit\n! style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\"| BCD<br />8&nbsp;4&nbsp;2&nbsp;1\n! style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\"| [[George Stibitz|Stibitz]]&nbsp;Code or [[Excess-3]]\n! style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\"| [[Aiken-Code]] or BCD<br />2&nbsp;4&nbsp;2&nbsp;1\n! style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\"| BCD<br />8&nbsp;4&nbsp;\u22122&nbsp;\u22121\n! style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\"| {{nowrap| [[IBM 702]], }} {{nowrap| [[IBM 705]], }} {{nowrap| [[IBM 7080]], }} {{nowrap| [[IBM 1401]] }} 8&nbsp;4&nbsp;2&nbsp;1\n! style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\"| [[ASCII]] 0000&nbsp;8421\n! style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\"| [[EBCDIC]] 0000&nbsp;8421\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|0\n| 0000\n| 0011\n| 0000\n| 0000\n| 1010\n| 0011&nbsp;0000\n| 1111&nbsp;0000\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|1\n| 0001\n| 0100\n| 0001\n| 0111\n| 0001\n| 0011&nbsp;0001\n| 1111&nbsp;0001\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|2\n| 0010\n| 0101\n| 0010\n| 0110\n| 0010\n| 0011&nbsp;0010\n| 1111&nbsp;0010\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|3\n| 0011\n| 0110\n| 0011\n| 0101\n| 0011\n| 0011&nbsp;0011\n| 1111&nbsp;0011\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|4\n| 0100\n| 0111\n| 0100\n| 0100\n| 0100\n| 0011&nbsp;0100\n| 1111&nbsp;0100\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|5\n| 0101\n| 1000\n| 1011\n| 1011\n| 0101\n| 0011&nbsp;0101\n| 1111&nbsp;0101\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|6\n| 0110\n| 1001\n| 1100\n| 1010\n| 0110\n| 0011 0110\n| 1111 0110\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|7\n| 0111\n| 1010\n| 1101\n| 1001\n| 0111\n| 0011&nbsp;0111\n| 1111&nbsp;0111\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|8\n| 1000\n| 1011\n| 1110\n| 1000\n| 1000\n| 0011&nbsp;1000\n| 1111&nbsp;1000\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|9\n| 1001\n| 1100\n| 1111\n| 1111\n| 1001\n| 0011&nbsp;1001\n| 1111&nbsp;1001\n|}\n\n==Legal history==\nIn the 1972 case ''[[Gottschalk v. Benson]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a lower court decision which had allowed a patent for converting BCD encoded numbers to binary on a computer. This was an important case in determining the patentability of software and algorithms.\n\n==Comparison with pure binary==\n<!-- not at all clear why this needs to be here at all, shouldn't the article just describe BCD? (mfc)-->\n<!--as an alternative number system for computing and electronics imo a comparison to the standard one is justified (plugwash)-->\n\n===Advantages===\n* Many non-integral values, such as decimal 0.2, have an infinite place-value representation in binary (.001100110011...) but have a finite place-value in binary-coded decimal (0.0010). Consequently, a system based on binary-coded decimal representations of decimal fractions avoids errors representing and calculating such values. This is useful in financial calculations.\n* Scaling by a power of 10 is simple.\n* [[Rounding]] at a decimal digit boundary is simpler. Addition and subtraction in decimal does not require rounding.\n* Alignment of two decimal numbers (for example 1.3 + 27.08) is a simple, exact, shift.\n* Conversion to a character form or for display (e.g., to a text-based format such as [[XML]], or to drive signals for a [[seven-segment display]]) is a simple per-digit mapping, and can be done in linear ([[Big-O notation|O]](''n'')) time. Conversion from pure [[binary numeral system|binary]] involves relatively complex logic that spans digits, and for large numbers no linear-time conversion algorithm is known (see {{see section|Binary numeral system|Conversion to and from other numeral systems}}).\n\n===Disadvantages===\n* Some operations are more complex to implement. [[Adder (electronics)|Adder]]s require extra logic to cause them to wrap and generate a carry early. 15 to 20 percent more circuitry is needed for BCD add compared to pure binary.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Multiplication requires the use of algorithms that are somewhat more complex than shift-mask-add (a [[Binary numeral system#Multiplication|binary multiplication]], requiring binary shifts and adds or the equivalent, per-digit or group of digits is required)\n* Standard BCD requires four bits per digit, roughly 20 percent more space than a binary encoding (the ratio of 4 bits to log<sub>2</sub>10 bits is 1.204). When packed so that three digits are encoded in ten bits, the storage overhead is greatly reduced, at the expense of an encoding that is unaligned with the 8-bit byte boundaries common on existing hardware, resulting in slower implementations on these systems.<!-- Could add: encoding or decoding is trivial in software using a table lookup, and fast using direct logic otherwise. In hardware it requires no more than three gate delays. -->\n* Practical existing implementations of BCD are typically slower than operations on binary representations, especially on embedded systems, due to limited processor support for native BCD operations.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mathur|first=A.

This form is easily converted into ASCII for display.<ref>http://www.se.ecu.edu.au/units/ens1242/lectures/ens_Notes_08.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><!-- also see MC6818 datasheet -->\n\nThe [[Atari 8-bit family]] of computers used BCD to implement floating-point algorithms. The [[MOS Technology 6502|MOS 6502]] processor has a BCD mode that affects the addition and subtraction instructions. The [[Psion Organiser|Psion Organiser 1]] handheld computer's manufacturer-supplied software also used entirely BCD to implement floating point; later Psion models used binary exclusively.\n\nEarly models of the [[PlayStation 3]] store the date and time in BCD. This led to a worldwide outage of the console on 1 March 2010. The last two digits of the year stored as BCD [[time formatting and storage bugs|were misinterpreted]] as 16 causing an error in the unit's date, rendering most functions inoperable. This has been referred to as the [[Year 2010 problem|Year 2010 Problem]].\n\n==Representational variations==\nVarious BCD implementations exist that employ other representations for numbers. [[Programmable calculator]]s manufactured by [[Texas Instruments]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], and others typically employ a [[floating-point]] BCD format, typically with two or three digits for the (decimal) exponent. The extra bits of the sign digit may be used to indicate special numeric values, such as [[infinity]], [[arithmetic underflow|underflow]]/[[arithmetic overflow|overflow]], and [[Defined and undefined|error]] (a blinking display).\n\n===Signed variations===\nSigned decimal values may be represented in several ways. The [[COBOL]] programming language, for example, supports a total of five zoned decimal formats, each one encoding the numeric sign in a different way:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#D0E0FF; width:25%\"| Type\n! style=\"background:#D0E0FF; width:55%\"| Description\n! style=\"background:#D0E0FF; width:20%\"| Example\n|-\n| Unsigned\n| No sign nibble\n| <code>F1 F2 <u>F</u>3</code>\n|-\n| Signed trailing ''(canonical format)''\n| Sign nibble in the last (least significant) byte\n| <code>F1 F2 <u>C</u>3</code>\n|-\n| Signed leading ''(overpunch)''\n| Sign nibble in the first (most significant) byte\n| <code><u>C</u>1 F2 F3</code>\n|-\n| Signed trailing separate\n| Separate sign character byte (<code>'+'</code> or <code>'\u2212'</code>) following the digit bytes\n| <code>F1 F2 F3 <u>2B</u></code>\n|-\n| Signed leading separate\n| Separate sign character byte (<code>'+'</code> or <code>'\u2212'</code>) preceding the digit bytes\n| <code><u>2B</u> F1 F2 F3</code>\n|}\n\n==={{anchor|TBCD}}Telephony Binary Coded Decimal (TBCD)===\n[[3GPP]] developed '''TBCD''',<ref>{{cite techreport |title=3GPP TS 29.002: Mobile Application Part (MAP) specification |at=sec. 17.7.8 Common data types |year=2013 |url=http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/29002.htm}}</ref> an expansion to BCD where the remaining (unused) bit combinations are used to add specific [[telephony]] characters,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_etr/001_099/060/02_60/etr_060e02p.pdf |title=Signalling Protocols and Switching (SPS) Guidelines for using Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) in telecommunication application protocols |page=15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.openss7.org/specs/xmap.pdf |title=XOM Mobile Application Part (XMAP) Specification |page=93 |access-date=27 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221103429/http://www.openss7.org/specs/xmap.pdf |archive-date=21 February 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> with digits similar to those found in [[Dual-tone multi-frequency signaling|telephone keypads]] original design.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:30%; text-align:center\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#E0E0E0; width:50%\" |Decimal<br/>Digit\n! style=\"background:#E0E0E0; width:50%\" |TBCD<br/>8 4 2 1\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F0F0F0\" |*\n| 1 0 1 0\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F0F0F0\" |#\n| 1 0 1 1\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F0F0F0\" |a\n| 1 1 0 0\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F0F0F0\" |b\n| 1 1 0 1\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F0F0F0\" |c\n| 1 1 1 0\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F0F0F0\" |Used as filler when there is an odd number of digits\n| 1 1 1 1\n|}\n\nThe mentioned 3GPP document defines '''TBCD-STRING''' with swapped nibbles in each byte.

For example, 0.2 can be represented as 2{{e|-1}}.\n\nThis representation allows rapid multiplication and division, but may require shifting by a power of 10 during addition and subtraction to align the decimal points. It is appropriate for applications with a fixed number of decimal places that do not then require this adjustment\u2014particularly financial applications where 2 or 4 digits after the decimal point are usually enough. Indeed, this is almost a form of [[fixed point arithmetic]] since the position of the [[radix point]] is implied.\n\n[[Chen\u2013Ho encoding]] provides a boolean transformation for converting groups of three BCD-encoded digits to and from 10-bit values that can be efficiently encoded in hardware with only 2 or 3 gate delays.

It has been serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Champion]]'' since September 8, 2016, with the chapters collected into 18 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes as of April 8, 2020. The story takes place in a world of modern, civilized, [[anthropomorphic]] animals with a cultural divide between the [[carnivore]]s and [[herbivore]]s. The series takes its name from the in-universe rank of Beastar, an individual of great talent, service, and notoriety.\n\nAn [[anime]] television series adaptation by [[Orange (animation studio)|Orange]] aired from October 8 to December 26, 2019 on [[Fuji TV]]'s [[+Ultra]] programming block. A second season is scheduled for release in 2021. ''Beastars'' has won multiple awards, including being the first [[Akita Shoten]] title to take home the [[Manga Taish\u014d]] Award. The manga is licensed for English release in North America by [[Viz Media]], while the anime is licensed by [[Netflix]].\n\n==Plot==\nLegoshi, a large gray [[wolf]], is a timid and quiet student of Cherryton Academy where he lives in a dorm with several other carnivorous students including his outgoing [[Labrador Retriever|Labrador]] friend, Jack. As a member of the school's drama club, Legoshi works as a stagehand and supports the actors of the club headed by the star pupil Louis, a [[red deer]]. \n\nOut of nowhere, Tem the [[alpaca]] is brutally murdered and devoured in the night, setting off a wave of unease and distrust between the herbivore and carnivore students. At the same time, Legoshi has a fateful encounter with Haru, a small [[dwarf rabbit]], and begins developing complex feelings for her.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Nihongo|'''Legoshi'''|\u30ec\u30b4\u30b7|Regoshi}}\n:{{Voiced by|Chikahiro Kobayashi<ref name=\"cast\">{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2019-07-07/chikahiro-kobayashi-sayaka-senbongi-star-in-beastars-anime/.148771|title=Chikahiro Kobayashi, Sayaka Senbongi Star in BEASTARS Anime|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=July 8, 2019|accessdate=July 8, 2019}}</ref>|Jonah Scott<ref name=\"Beastars ENG Cast\">{{cite web |last1=Mateo |first1=Alex |title=BEASTARS Anime Reveals English Dub Cast|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-02-20/beastars-anime-reveals-english-dub-cast/.156674 |website=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=February 20, 2020 |date=February 20, 2020}}</ref>}}\n:Legoshi, 17 years old at the start of the story,<ref name=Vol1ENVizp204>{{cite book|author=Itagaki, Paru|translator=Tomoko Kimura|title=Beastars|language=en|publisher=[[VIZ Media]]|date=July 2019|volume=1|page=204}} - First printing, and Annette Roman did the adaptation.</ref> is a towering gray [[wolf]] with a quiet personality contrasting his appearance.

Legoshi saves a young wolf girl named Juno from a couple of bullies, winning her affection. Later, he, Aoba and a group of their peers go downtown to city hall to collect information for the Meteorite Festival. Then, after spending the day in the city, they get lost and stray into a district called the Black Market, where Legoshi is horrified to see herbivores selling their own body parts to passing carnivores. While running away through the market, Legoshi is overcome by the scent of meat and passes out in a back alley. There he is picked up by the Black Market's psychotherapist and guardian, who explains to Legoshi that his feelings for Haru are actually his predatory instincts disguised as romantic feelings. When Legoshi explains to him that he has no prior experience with love, he gives him a rabbit-themed erotic magazine to test whether those feelings are based on love or predatory instincts. On his way back to school, Legoshi runs into Aoba, who was likewise disgusted by the Black Market, and the two reconcile.

It is the highest charting song by Nine Inch Nails on all charts except for U.S. [[Modern Rock Tracks]], where it stayed at number one for five weeks, because the single that followed, \"[[Only (Nine Inch Nails song)|Only]]\", stayed at number one for two more weeks (non-consecutively), and the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] peaking at number 31, bested only by the group's 1999 single \"[[The Day the World Went Away]]\", which peaked at number 17 but did not chart anywhere else in the U.S. and never had any popular success{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}, making it one of their less popular singles. It is, to date, Nine Inch Nails' only single to hit the top 10 of the [[UK Singles Chart]], as well as their highest-charting single on the U.S. [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart, peaking at number two. It was also a crossover hit, crossing over to [[Contemporary hit radio|pop radio]] as their first top 40 radio hit since \"[[Closer (Nine Inch Nails song)|Closer]]\" and \"[[Hurt (Nine Inch Nails song)|Hurt]]\" in 1994 and 1995, respectively, peaking at number 31 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\n==Background==\nThough several stations played a leaked copy of \"The Hand That Feeds\" in February, official radio play of the song began on March 14, 2005.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}  \"The Hand That Feeds\" was released for sale on both [[iTunes]] and [[Napster]] on March 22, 2005.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nA [[music video]] was made for this song.  It was directed by [[Rob Sheridan]] and was released on March 17, 2005 on the [http://www.nin.com NIN official website].  A second video for this song was directed by [[Ian Inaba]], but was shelved and was never completed.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nThe April 15, 2005, update to the NIN website included a link to a multi-track [[GarageBand]] file of the song.  This file allows anyone with the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] program GarageBand to remix the song.\n\nNIN was due to play this song at the [[2005 MTV Movie Awards]], but dropped out due to conflicts between Trent Reznor and MTV concerning the band's plan to incorporate an image of [[George W. Bush]] into the performance. An announcement made by Trent Reznor on the [http://www.nin.com NIN website] on May 26 stated:\n<blockquote>\"Nine Inch Nails will not be performing at the MTV Movie Awards as previously announced. We were set to perform 'The Hand That Feeds' with an unmolested, straightforward image of George W. Bush as the backdrop. Apparently, the image of our president is as offensive to MTV as it is to me. See you on tour this fall when we return to play in America.\"</blockquote> The following day, MTV stated, <blockquote>\"While we respect Nine Inch Nails' point of view, we were uncomfortable with their performance being built around a partisan political statement. When we discussed our discomfort with the band, their choice was to unfortunately pull out of the Movie Awards.\"</blockquote> Nine Inch Nails was eventually replaced by [[Foo Fighters]] at the ceremony on June 9.\n\nDuring the performance of The Hand That Feeds in Jacksonville, Florida on October 29, 2008, a photo of George W. Bush was displayed behind the band, and as the band played the photo gradually morphed into [[John McCain]], the Republican candidate for the 2008 presidential election.\n\nThe song was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance|Best Hard Rock Performance]] for the 48th Annual [[Grammy Awards]] in 2006.<ref>{{cite web\n  | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/08/arts/09gram-list.html\n  | work=[[The New York Times]]\n  | accessdate = 2008-04-13\n  | title = The Complete List of Grammy Nominations\n  | date = 2005-12-08}}</ref>\n\nThe song is included in the videogames ''[[Rock Band (video game)|Rock Band]]'', ''[[Midnight Club 3]]'' and as downloadable content in ''[[Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock]]'' and ''[[Rock Band 4]]''. The song also appears in the trailer to ''[[Red Riding Hood (2011 film)|Red Riding Hood]]'' and in the TV spot for ''[[Underworld: Evolution]]''. In 2009, it ranked at number 406 in [[Pitchfork Media]]'s list of The Top 500 Tracks of the 2000s.<ref>http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/7685-the-top-500-tracks-of-the-2000s-500-201/</ref>\n\n==Music video==\nThe music video for the song was directed by Trent Reznor and [[Rob Sheridan]] and debuted on the official Nine Inch Nails website.  The video features the [[Nine Inch Nails live performances|live band]], featuring [[Aaron North]], [[Jeordie White]], [[Jerome Dillon]], and [[Alessandro Cortini]], performing the song in close quarters. The video features the use of the [[pan and scan]] technique, resulting in video distortion such as pixelization and interlacing. During the final chorus, the band members become intentionally more distorted by additional interlacing.\n\n==The single==\nThe single for \"The Hand That Feeds\" was only given a wide release in Europe.  The European releases include a 3-track limited edition CD, a 2-track standard CD, a 9-inch vinyl and a DVD single.\n\nIn the United States, \"The Hand That Feeds\" was released on various [[gramophone record|vinyl]] formats.

It is the highest charting song by Nine Inch Nails on all charts except for U.S. [[Modern Rock Tracks]], where it stayed at number one for five weeks, because the single that followed, \"[[Only (Nine Inch Nails song)|Only]]\", stayed at number one for two more weeks (non-consecutively), and the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] peaking at number 31, bested only by the group's 1999 single \"[[The Day the World Went Away]]\", which peaked at number 17 but did not chart anywhere else in the U.S. and never had any popular success{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}, making it one of their less popular singles. It is, to date, Nine Inch Nails' only single to hit the top 10 of the [[UK Singles Chart]], as well as their highest-charting single on the U.S. [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart, peaking at number two. It was also a crossover hit, crossing over to [[Contemporary hit radio|pop radio]] as their first top 40 radio hit since \"[[Closer (Nine Inch Nails song)|Closer]]\" and \"[[Hurt (Nine Inch Nails song)|Hurt]]\" in 1994 and 1995, respectively, peaking at number 31 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\n==Background==\nThough several stations played a leaked copy of \"The Hand That Feeds\" in February, official radio play of the song began on March 14, 2005.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}  \"The Hand That Feeds\" was released for sale on both [[iTunes]] and [[Napster]] on March 22, 2005.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nA [[music video]] was made for this song.  It was directed by [[Rob Sheridan]] and was released on March 17, 2005 on the [http://www.nin.com NIN official website].  A second video for this song was directed by [[Ian Inaba]], but was shelved and was never completed.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nThe April 15, 2005, update to the NIN website included a link to a multi-track [[GarageBand]] file of the song.  This file allows anyone with the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] program GarageBand to remix the song.\n\nNIN was due to play this song at the [[2005 MTV Movie Awards]], but dropped out due to conflicts between Trent Reznor and MTV concerning the band's plan to incorporate an image of [[George W. Bush]] into the performance. An announcement made by Trent Reznor on the [http://www.nin.com NIN website] on May 26 stated:\n<blockquote>\"Nine Inch Nails will not be performing at the MTV Movie Awards as previously announced. We were set to perform 'The Hand That Feeds' with an unmolested, straightforward image of George W. Bush as the backdrop. Apparently, the image of our president is as offensive to MTV as it is to me. See you on tour this fall when we return to play in America.\"</blockquote> The following day, MTV stated, <blockquote>\"While we respect Nine Inch Nails' point of view, we were uncomfortable with their performance being built around a partisan political statement. When we discussed our discomfort with the band, their choice was to unfortunately pull out of the Movie Awards.\"</blockquote> Nine Inch Nails was eventually replaced by [[Foo Fighters]] at the ceremony on June 9.\n\nDuring the performance of The Hand That Feeds in Jacksonville, Florida on October 29, 2008, a photo of George W. Bush was displayed behind the band, and as the band played the photo gradually morphed into [[John McCain]], the Republican candidate for the 2008 presidential election.\n\nThe song was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance|Best Hard Rock Performance]] for the 48th Annual [[Grammy Awards]] in 2006.<ref>{{cite web\n  | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/08/arts/09gram-list.html\n  | work=[[The New York Times]]\n  | accessdate = 2008-04-13\n  | title = The Complete List of Grammy Nominations\n  | date = 2005-12-08}}</ref>\n\nThe song is included in the videogames ''[[Rock Band (video game)|Rock Band]]'', ''[[Midnight Club 3]]'' and as downloadable content in ''[[Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock]]'' and ''[[Rock Band 4]]''. The song also appears in the trailer to ''[[Red Riding Hood (2011 film)|Red Riding Hood]]'' and in the TV spot for ''[[Underworld: Evolution]]''. In 2009, it ranked at number 406 in [[Pitchfork Media]]'s list of The Top 500 Tracks of the 2000s.<ref>http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/7685-the-top-500-tracks-of-the-2000s-500-201/</ref>\n\n==Music video==\nThe music video for the song was directed by Trent Reznor and [[Rob Sheridan]] and debuted on the official Nine Inch Nails website.  The video features the [[Nine Inch Nails live performances|live band]], featuring [[Aaron North]], [[Jeordie White]], [[Jerome Dillon]], and [[Alessandro Cortini]], performing the song in close quarters. The video features the use of the [[pan and scan]] technique, resulting in video distortion such as pixelization and interlacing. During the final chorus, the band members become intentionally more distorted by additional interlacing.\n\n==The single==\nThe single for \"The Hand That Feeds\" was only given a wide release in Europe.  The European releases include a 3-track limited edition CD, a 2-track standard CD, a 9-inch vinyl and a DVD single.\n\nIn the United States, \"The Hand That Feeds\" was released on various [[gramophone record|vinyl]] formats.  A [[Special edition|limited edition]] 10-inch [[Unusual types of gramophone records#Picture discs|picture disc]] and a 7-inch promotional disc (the latter available at ''[[With Teeth]]'' listening parties) contained the title track and the [[b-side]] \"Home.\"  Additional 12-inch remix records, containing mixes by [[Photek]] and [[DFA Records|DFA]] were also available.\n\n===Releases===\n* [[Island Records]] CID888 - CD\n* Island Records CIDV888 - DVD\n* Island Records 9IS888 - 9-inch vinyl\n* [[Interscope Records]] HALO_18 V2 - 10-inch picture disc (limited edition)\n* Interscope Records INTR-11401-7 - 7-inch vinyl (promo)\n* Interscope Records B0005127-11 - 12-inch vinyl, Photek remixes\n* Interscope Records B0005129-11 - 12-inch vinyl, DFA remixes\n\n===Track listing===\n\n{{tracklist\n|headline= CD (Available as 2-track standard release and 3-track limited edition digipack)\n|title1= The Hand That Feeds\n|length1= 3:38\n|title2= The Hand That Feeds (Straight mix)\n|length2= 7:46\n|title3= The Hand That Feeds (Dub mix)\n|note3= limited edition only\n|length3= 7:52\n}}\n\n{{tracklist\n|headline = DVD (includes poster)\n|title1= The Hand That Feeds (Video)\n|title2= The Hand That Feeds\n|title3= The Hand That Feeds (Straight Mix)\n}}\n\n{{tracklist\n|headline= 9-inch vinyl\n|title1= The Hand That Feeds\n|title2= The Hand That Feeds (Dub Mix)\n}}\n\n{{tracklist\n|headline = 10-inch picture disc and 7-inch promotional vinyl\n|title1= The Hand That Feeds\n|title2= Home\n|length2= 3:12\n}}\n\n{{tracklist\n|headline= 12-inch Photek remixes\n|title1= The Hand That Feeds (Straight Mix)\n|title2= The Hand That Feeds (Ruff Mix)\n|length2= 3:58\n|title3= The Hand That Feeds (Dub Instrumental)\n|length3= 7:51\n|title4= The Hand That Feeds\n}}\n\n{{tracklist\n|headline= 12-inch DFA remixes\n|title1= The Hand That Feeds (DFA Remix)\n|length1= 9:02\n|title2= The Hand That Feeds (DFA Remix Instrumental)\n|length2= 9:01\n|title3= The Hand That Feeds (DFA Version I)\n|length3= 14:12\n}}\n\n==Charts==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!
