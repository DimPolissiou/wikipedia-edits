Other users will be \"situationally impaired\" (e.g. wearing gloves in a very noisy environment, driving, or needing to enter a credit card number in a public place) and will simply use the appropriate modalities as desired. On the other hand, a multimodal application that requires users to be able to operate all modalities is very poorly designed.\n\nThe most common form of input multimodality in the market makes use of the [[XHTML+Voice]] (aka X+V) Web markup language, an open [[specification]] developed by [[IBM]], [[Motorola]], and [[Opera Software]]. [[XHTML+Voice|X+V]] is currently under consideration by the [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] and combines several [[W3C Recommendation]]s including [[Extensible HyperText Markup Language|XHTML]] for visual markup, [[VoiceXML]] for voice markup, and [[XML Events]], a standard for integrating [[Extensible Markup Language|XML]] languages.  [[Multimodal browser]]s supporting [[XHTML+Voice|X+V]] include IBM WebSphere Everyplace Multimodal Environment, [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] for [[embedded system|Embedded]] [[Linux]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], and [[ACCESS Systems]] [[NetFront]] for [[Windows Mobile]]. To develop multimodal applications, [[software developer]]s may use a [[software development kit]], such as IBM WebSphere Multimodal Toolkit, based on the [[open source]] [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] [[Software framework|framework]], which includes an [[XHTML+Voice|X+V]] [[debugger]], [[source code editor|editor]], and [[simulator]].\n\n== Multimodal output ==\nThe second group of multimodal systems presents users with multimedia displays and multimodal output, primarily in the form of visual and auditory cues. Interface designers have also started to make use of other modalities, such as touch and olfaction. Proposed benefits of multimodal output system include synergy and redundancy. The information that is presented via several modalities is merged and refers to various aspects of the same process. The use of several modalities for processing exactly the same information provides an increased bandwidth of information transfer \n.<ref>{{Citation |first=S. |last=Oviatt |contribution=Multimodal interfaces |editor1-first=J. |editor1-last=Jacko |editor2-first=A |editor2-last=Sears |title=The Human-Computer Interaction Handbook |year=2002 |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum |url=https://www.cogsci.msu.edu/DSS/2004-2005/Oviatt/Multimodel%20Interfaces.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite conference |first1=C. |last1=Bauckhage |first2=J. |last2=Fritsch |first3=K.J. |last3=Rohlfing |first4=S. |last4=Wachsmuth |first5=G. |last5=Sagerer |title=Evaluating integrated speech-and image understanding |booktitle=Int.

The auditory channel differs from vision in several aspects. It is omnidirectional, transient and is always reserved.<ref name=sarter/> Speech output, one form of auditory information, received considerable attention. Several guidelines have been developed for the use of speech. Michaelis and Wiggins (1982) suggested that speech output should be used for simple short messages that will not be referred to later. It was also recommended that speech should be generated in time and require an immediate response.\n\nThe sense of touch was first utilized as a medium for communication in the late 1950s.<ref>{{cite journal|first=F.A |last=Geldar |title=Adventures in tactile literacy |journal=American Psychologist |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=115\u2013124 |year=1957 |doi=10.1037/h0040416}}</ref> It is not only a promising but also a unique communication channel. In contrast to vision and hearing, the two traditional senses employed in HCI, the sense of touch is proximal: it senses objects that are in contact with the body, and it is bidirectional in that it supports both perception and acting on the environment.\n\nExamples of auditory feedback include auditory icons in computer operating systems indicating users' actions (e.g. deleting a file, open a folder, error), speech output for presenting navigational guidance in vehicles, and speech output for warning pilots on modern airplane cockpits. Examples of tactile signals include vibrations of the turn-signal lever to warn drivers of a car in their blind spot, the vibration of auto seat as a warning to drivers, and the [[stick shaker]] on modern aircraft alerting pilots to an impending stall.<ref name=sarter/>\n\nInvisible interface spaces became available using sensor technology.

An ambiguity arises when more than one interpretation of input is possible. A multimodal ambiguity<ref name=Caschera5 />  arises both, if an element, which is provided by one modality, has more than one interpretation (i.e. ambiguities are propagated at the multimodal level), and/or if elements, connected with each modality, are univocally interpreted, but information referred to different modalities are incoherent at the syntactic or the semantic level (i.e. a multimodal sentence having different meanings or different  syntactic structure).\n\nIn \"The Management of Ambiguities\",<ref name=\"Caschera3\" /> the methods for solving ambiguities and for providing the correct interpretation of the user's input are organized in three main classes: prevention, a-posterior resolution and approximation resolution methods.<ref name=\"Caschera2\" /><ref name=\"Chai\" />\n\nPrevention methods impose users to follow predefined interaction behaviour according to a set of transitions between different allowed states of the interaction process.

However other modalities, such as pen-based input or [[Haptic technology|haptic]] input/output may be used. Multimodal user interfaces are a research area in [[human-computer interaction]] (HCI).\n\nThe advantage of multiple input [[Modality (human-computer interaction)|modalities]] is increased [[usability]]: the weaknesses of one modality are offset by the strengths of another. On a mobile device with a small visual interface and keypad, a word may be quite difficult to type but very easy to say (e.g. [[Poughkeepsie, New York|Poughkeepsie]]).  Consider how you would access and search through [[digital media]] catalogs from these same devices or set top boxes. And in one real-world example, patient information in an operating room environment is accessed verbally by members of the surgical team to maintain an antiseptic environment, and presented in near realtime aurally and visually to maximize comprehension.\n\nMultimodal input user interfaces have implications for [[accessibility]].<ref>{{cite conference |first1=H.S. |last1=Vitense |first2=J.A. |last2=Jacko |first3=V.K. |last3=Emery |title=Multimodal feedback: establishing a performance baseline for improved access by individuals with visual impairments |booktitle=ACM Conf. on Assistive Technologies |year=2002}}</ref> A well-designed multimodal application can be used by people with a wide variety of impairments. Visually impaired users rely on the voice modality with some keypad input.  Hearing-impaired users rely on the visual modality with some speech input. Other users will be \"situationally impaired\" (e.g. wearing gloves in a very noisy environment, driving, or needing to enter a credit card number in a public place) and will simply use the appropriate modalities as desired. On the other hand, a multimodal application that requires users to be able to operate all modalities is very poorly designed.\n\nThe most common form of input multimodality in the market makes use of the [[XHTML+Voice]] (aka X+V) Web markup language, an open [[specification]] developed by [[IBM]], [[Motorola]], and [[Opera Software]]. [[XHTML+Voice|X+V]] is currently under consideration by the [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] and combines several [[W3C Recommendation]]s including [[Extensible HyperText Markup Language|XHTML]] for visual markup, [[VoiceXML]] for voice markup, and [[XML Events]], a standard for integrating [[Extensible Markup Language|XML]] languages.  [[Multimodal browser]]s supporting [[XHTML+Voice|X+V]] include IBM WebSphere Everyplace Multimodal Environment, [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] for [[embedded system|Embedded]] [[Linux]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], and [[ACCESS Systems]] [[NetFront]] for [[Windows Mobile]]. To develop multimodal applications, [[software developer]]s may use a [[software development kit]], such as IBM WebSphere Multimodal Toolkit, based on the [[open source]] [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] [[Software framework|framework]], which includes an [[XHTML+Voice|X+V]] [[debugger]], [[source code editor|editor]], and [[simulator]].\n\n== Multimodal output ==\nThe second group of multimodal systems presents users with multimedia displays and multimodal output, primarily in the form of visual and auditory cues. Interface designers have also started to make use of other modalities, such as touch and olfaction. Proposed benefits of multimodal output system include synergy and redundancy. The information that is presented via several modalities is merged and refers to various aspects of the same process. The use of several modalities for processing exactly the same information provides an increased bandwidth of information transfer \n.<ref>{{Citation |first=S. |last=Oviatt |contribution=Multimodal interfaces |editor1-first=J. |editor1-last=Jacko |editor2-first=A |editor2-last=Sears |title=The Human-Computer Interaction Handbook |year=2002 |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum |url=https://www.cogsci.msu.edu/DSS/2004-2005/Oviatt/Multimodel%20Interfaces.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite conference |first1=C. |last1=Bauckhage |first2=J. |last2=Fritsch |first3=K.J. |last3=Rohlfing |first4=S. |last4=Wachsmuth |first5=G. |last5=Sagerer |title=Evaluating integrated speech-and image understanding |booktitle=Int.

The auditory channel differs from vision in several aspects. It is omnidirectional, transient and is always reserved.<ref name=sarter/> Speech output, one form of auditory information, received considerable attention. Several guidelines have been developed for the use of speech. Michaelis and Wiggins (1982) suggested that speech output should be used for simple short messages that will not be referred to later. It was also recommended that speech should be generated in time and require an immediate response.\n\nThe sense of touch was first utilized as a medium for communication in the late 1950s.<ref>{{cite journal|first=F.A |last=Geldar |title=Adventures in tactile literacy |journal=American Psychologist |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=115\u2013124 |year=1957 |doi=10.1037/h0040416}}</ref> It is not only a promising but also a unique communication channel. In contrast to vision and hearing, the two traditional senses employed in HCI, the sense of touch is proximal: it senses objects that are in contact with the body, and it is bidirectional in that it supports both perception and acting on the environment.\n\nExamples of auditory feedback include auditory icons in computer operating systems indicating users' actions (e.g. deleting a file, open a folder, error), speech output for presenting navigational guidance in vehicles, and speech output for warning pilots on modern airplane cockpits. Examples of tactile signals include vibrations of the turn-signal lever to warn drivers of a car in their blind spot, the vibration of auto seat as a warning to drivers, and the [[stick shaker]] on modern aircraft alerting pilots to an impending stall.<ref name=sarter/>\n\nInvisible interface spaces became available using sensor technology. Infrared, ultrasound and cameras are all now commonly used.<ref>{{cite conference |first1=A. |last1=Brooks |first2=E. |last2=Petersson |title=SoundScapes: non-formal learning potentials from interactive VEs |booktitle=SIGGRAPH |year=2007 |doi=10.1145/1282040.1282059 |url=http://vbn.aau.dk/ws/files/13321650/pdf }}</ref> Transparency of interfacing with content is enhanced providing an immediate and direct link via meaningful mapping is in place, thus the user has direct and immediate feedback to input and content response becomes interface affordance (Gibson 1979).\n\n==Multimodal fusion==\nThe process of integrating information from various input modalities and combining them into a complete command is referred as multimodal fusion.<ref name=Dulizia1 /> In literature, three main approaches to the fusion process have been proposed, according to the main architectural levels (recognition and decision) at which the fusion of the input signals can be performed: recognition-based,<ref name=Pavlovic /><ref name=Andre /><ref name=\"Vo2\">Vo, M.T.

An ambiguity arises when more than one interpretation of input is possible. A multimodal ambiguity<ref name=Caschera5 />  arises both, if an element, which is provided by one modality, has more than one interpretation (i.e. ambiguities are propagated at the multimodal level), and/or if elements, connected with each modality, are univocally interpreted, but information referred to different modalities are incoherent at the syntactic or the semantic level (i.e. a multimodal sentence having different meanings or different  syntactic structure).\n\nIn \"The Management of Ambiguities\",<ref name=\"Caschera3\" /> the methods for solving ambiguities and for providing the correct interpretation of the user's input are organized in three main classes: prevention, a-posterior resolution and approximation resolution methods.<ref name=\"Caschera2\" /><ref name=\"Chai\" />\n\nPrevention methods impose users to follow predefined interaction behaviour according to a set of transitions between different allowed states of the interaction process.

It is around five miles ({{convert|5|mi|abbr=out|disp=output only|0}}) south of [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]].<ref name=Pastscape>{{cite PastScape|mnumber=80206 |mname= Star Carr|accessdate=15 January 2008}}</ref>\nIt is generally regarded as the most important and informative Mesolithic site in [[Great Britain]]. It is as important to the Mesolithic period as [[Stonehenge]] is to the [[Neolithic]] period or [[Scandinavian York]] is to understanding [[Viking Age]] Britain.\n\nThe site was occupied during the early Mesolithic archaeological period, which coincided with the [[preboreal]] and [[boreal (period)|boreal]] climatic periods. Though the [[Last Glacial Period|ice age]] had ended and temperatures were close to modern averages, sea levels had not yet risen sufficiently to separate Britain from continental [[Europe]]. Highlights among the finds include Britain\u2019s oldest structure, 21 [[red deer]] stag skull-caps that may have been headdresses and nearly 200 projectile, or harpoon, points made of red deer [[antler]]. These organic materials were preserved due to having been buried in waterlogged [[peat]]. Normally all that remains on Mesolithic sites are [[stone tool]]s.\n\nExcavation of the site began in 1948, a year after artefacts were first noticed by an amateur archaeologist. The site is most famous for some of the extremely rare [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] discovered during the original excavations but its importance has been reinforced by new understandings of the nature and extent of the Mesolithic archaeology in the area and reinterpretations of the original material.\n\n==General information==\n\n===Environmental context===\nStar Carr now lies under farmland at the eastern end of the [[Vale of Pickering]]. During the Mesolithic the site was near the outflow at the western end of a palaeolake, known as [[Lake Flixton]].{{Sfn|Mellars|Dark|1998|pp=4,13}} At the end of the last ice age, a combination of glacial and post-glacial [[geomorphology]] caused the area to drain to the west (away from the shortest-distance to the [[North Sea]] at [[Filey]]). The basin filled by Lake Flixton was probably created by glacial 'scarring'.\n\nThe site is preserved due to Lake Flixton having been in-filled with peat during the course of the Mesolithic. Waterlogged peat prevents organic finds from oxidizing and has led to some of the best preservation conditions possible (such conditions have preserved the famous [[bog bodies]] found in other parts of northern Europe).\nAs a result of such good conditions, archaeologists were able to recover bone, antler, and wood in addition to the flints that are normally all that is left on sites from this period.\n\nDuring the period of Mesolithic occupation the area surrounding the lake would have been a mixed forest of [[birch]], [[aspen]] and [[willow]].{{Sfn|Mellars|Dark|1998|pp=147\u2013161}} The lake edge and shallows would have been full of reeds, water lily and other aquatic plants and lake levels would have changed dynamically in response to rainfall or snow-melt.\n\nThese and many other plants would have formed the base of a complex [[food web]]. The [[mammal]]s that we have evidence for include [[herbivore]]s such as [[beaver]], red deer, [[roe deer]], [[moose|elk]] \n, [[aurochs]], [[wild boar]], [[hare]] and [[carnivore]]s such as [[wolf]], [[lynx]], [[bear]], [[fox]], [[pine marten]], [[badger]] and [[hedgehog]].{{Sfn|Milner|2006|p=72}}\n\n===Key artefacts===\nAlong with the flints that are characteristic of [[Mesolithic]] sites, there were a large number of objects made of red deer and elk antler, elk bone, aurochs bone and one piece of bird bone.{{sfn|Clark|1954|pp=115\u2013164}} Rarer objects included worked [[amber]], [[shale]], [[haematite]], [[iron pyrites]], a decorated [[pendant]], thought to be the oldest known Mesolithic art in Britain <ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.11141/ia.40.8 | issue=40 | title=A Unique Engraved Shale Pendant from the Site of Star Carr: the oldest Mesolithic art in Britain | year=2016 | journal=Internet Archaeology | last1 = Milner | first1 = Nicky| doi-access=free }}</ref> and tightly-rolled pieces of birch-bark and pieces of birch-resin pitch or tar and worked wood.\nThe flint found at Star Carr came from nearby beaches, which at time of occupation would have been about {{convert|10|to|20|km|0|abbr=on}} distant, and also from the [[Yorkshire Wolds]] immediately to the south of the site.\n\nThe two most outstanding categories of finds are the 'barbed points' and 'antler frontlets'. The barbed points are made of the antler of red deer stags. They are between {{convert|8|cm|in}} and {{convert|38|cm|in}} in length{{sfn|Clark|1954|p=123}} and the 195 examples found at Star Carr account for more than 95% of the total number from the British Mesolithic. Many of the barbed points and antler frontlets appear to be deliberately broken. The antler frontlets are made from red deer stag (male) skulls with the antlers still attached. The 21 antler frontlets are sufficiently complete to see how they have been manufactured: two holes were perforated through the skull with a [[flint]] tool and the inside of the skull cap was smoothed. The antlers on each frontlet has been carefully trimmed maybe to reduce weight. It seems very likely that these modifications are designed to allow the frontlets to be used as headgear. Finds from the site are now divided between four institutions: The [[British Museum]], the [[Yorkshire Museum]] in York, the University [[Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Cambridge|Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]] at Cambridge and the [[Rotunda Museum|Scarborough Museum]].<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=5702&plaA=5702-3-1 British Museum Collection]</ref><ref name=\"sc2017\">{{cite web|title=Exhibitions|url=http://www.starcarr.com/exhibitions.html|website=Star Carr Archaeology Project|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Star Carr headdress cropped.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Red Deer Stag skull with holes]]\n[[File:Star Carr spear tips 01.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Barbed points]]\n\n===Evidence of structures===\nPost holes, a sunken area and concentrations of flints, burning and other artefacts indicate the presence of a structure approximately {{convert|3.5|m|ft}} wide. The posts were almost certainly made of wood and roughly {{convert|20|cm|in}} in diameter there may have been as many as 18 of them and the holes indicated that several may have been replaced over the course of the structure's use.\nIt is impossible to know the form or materials from which the walls and/or roof would have been made. They may have used [[Hide (skin)|hides]], [[thatch]], [[Peat|turf]] or [[Bark (botany)|bark]] on a conical ([[teepee]]-like) or rounded ([[wigwam]]-like) frame. There is no reason to suppose that the same materials and form would have been used for the structure's entire life-span. There was evidence that the floor was covered with a layer of moss, reeds and other soft plant materials {{convert|20|cm|in}}\u2013{{convert|30|cm|in}} deep.\n[[Radiocarbon]] dates indicated a use-life of between 200 and 500&nbsp;years.\nThe structure has been compared to the Mesolithic structure found at [[Howick, Northumberland|Howick]], Northumberland and British [[Iron Age]] [[Roundhouse (dwelling)|roundhouses]].\n\nA large wooden platform has been discovered nearby on the shore of the former lake \u2013 the earliest known example of carpentry in Europe, though its purpose is as yet unknown. Timbers of Aspen and Willow were split along the grain using wedges (probably made of wood and antler); these were then laid in the boggy areas at the lake shore, presumably to provide firm footing.\nThe extent of the wooden platform is not known but it may be a significantly larger and more complex undertaking than the house-like structure.\n\n===Chronology===\nCurrent [[radiocarbon]] dates from the site indicate occupation first commenced between 9335\u20139275&nbsp;BC, lasting for a period of around 800 years until 8525\u20138440&nbsp;BC.{{sfn|Milner, Conneller and Taylor|2018|pp=225\u2013244}} However, such occupations may have been episodic in nature, varying in intensity between different periods.{{sfn|Milner, Conneller and Taylor|2018|pp=225\u2013244}}\n\n==History of investigations==\n\n===Discovery and initial excavations===\nStar Carr was discovered in 1947 when John Moore, an amateur archaeologist, noticed flints in the exposed soil of several recently dredged ditches in the eastern Vale of Pickering. One of these sites, bordering on the [[River Derwent, Yorkshire#Course and character of the Derwent catchment area|New Hertford River]] was to the south of Star Carr Farm. Moore decided to excavate a small trench at Star Carr in 1948 as part of a series of investigations. On the discovery of intact organic remains Moore contacted Professor [[Grahame Clark]] of the [[University of Cambridge]] via [[Harry Godwin]] and the curator of the [[Rotunda Museum|Scarborough Museum]], [[Arthur Roy Clapham]].{{Sfn|Clark|1954|pp=xvii\u2013xviii}}<ref>{{cite news|last=Alleyne |first=Richard |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/7937240/Oldest-house-in-Britain-discovered-to-be-11500-years-old.html |title=Oldest house in Britain discovered to be 11,500 years old |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=10 August 2010 |accessdate=15 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nClark began his investigation with the explicit aim of building a more detailed picture of the Mesolithic environment and the ways in which people used it.<ref>Clark 1972, p. 7{{Full citation needed|date=October 2012}}</ref> The organic preservation enabled the recovery of the plant and animal remains necessary for this. Clark excavated from 1949 to 1951. Clark's 1954 publication of these excavations is a seminal text in the study of the British Mesolithic and prehistory generally.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nClark believed he had uncovered the entirety of the site and believed Star Carr could be used as a [[type-site]] for the British Mesolithic. He drew parallels between the finds at Star Carr and the site of [[Maglemosian|Maglemose]] in Denmark. It is now recognised that many of Clark\u2019s inferences were incorrect but the excavation remains one of the most important in the study of British prehistory ever undertaken.\n\n===Further investigations: The Lake Flixton Landscape===\nIn 1977 archaeologists excavated [[Iron Age]], [[Bronze Age]] and Mesolithic material from [[Seamer, Scarborough|Seamer]] Carr, just to the north of Star Carr. These excavations were conducted in advance of the Seamer Carr landfill site. The discovery of Mesolithic material led to a new series of investigations around Lake Flixton directed by [[Tim Schadla-Hall]] (currently [[University College London]]). This team returned to Star Carr in 1985 and 1989.<ref>{{harvnb|Mellars|Dark|1998|pp=}}{{page needed|date=August 2014}}</ref>\n\nThis project investigated the archaeology and ecology of the wider landscape around Lake Flixton and found several more Mesolithic sites but none with as many of the unusual artefacts (such as barbed points and antler frontlets) discovered at Star Carr.\n\n===The latest investigations===\nIn the 2000s new excavations began at Star Carr. This reinvestigation is being directed by [[Nicky Milner]] ([[Department of Archaeology at the University of York|University of York]]), Chantal Conneller ([[University of Manchester]]) and Barry Taylor ([[University of Chester]]). This ongoing project has reinvestigated Clark's excavations and also excavated the dry-land, discovering the structure.\n\n[[File:Star Carr Engraved Pendant.gif|thumb|right|Animated image showing the sequence of engravings on a pendant excavated from the Mesolithic archaeological site of Starr Carr in 2015 <ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Morgan | first1 = C. | last2 = Scholma-Mason | first2 = N. | year = 2017 | title = Animated GIFs as Expressive Visual Narratives and Expository Devices in Archaeology | url = | journal = Internet Archaeology | volume = | issue = 44| page = | doi = 10.11141/ia.44.11 | doi-access = free }}</ref>]]\n\nMost significantly, recent [[geochemical]] investigations have demonstrated that the preservation conditions have deteriorated. The result of this is that any remaining organic artefacts will be far less informative than those discovered by previous excavation projects. Though the reasons for this remain somewhat unclear, it appears that the acidity of the groundwater has massively increased in the last few years.\n\nA decorated pendant (the [[Star Carr Pendant]]), thought to be the oldest known Mesolithic art in Britain, was found at the site in 2015.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.11141/ia.40.8 | issue=40 | title=A Unique Engraved Shale Pendant from the Site of Star Carr: the oldest Mesolithic art in Britain | year=2016 | journal=Internet Archaeology | last1 = Milner | first1 = Nicky| doi-access=free }}</ref>  The 11,000 year old object has been on display at the [[Yorkshire Museum]] with other finds from the site since 2016.<ref>{{cite news | title = Yorkshire Stone Age pendant goes on display | publisher = [[BBC News Online]] | date = 26 February 2016 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-york-north-yorkshire-35669267 | accessdate = 26 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Interpretive debates==\nClark, the original excavator, believed the Mesolithic people would have lived on a brushwood platform on the edge of the former Lake Flixton.{{sfn|Clark|1954|p=xvii}} Recent excavations have revealed that people lived on the dry land upslope of the lake and various activities were carried out at the lake edge.\n\nThere is much debate about the time of year the site was occupied. Mesolithic people hunted a number of animals including red and roe deer, elk, aurochs and wild boar but there are various seasonal assessments and as the site was occupied over several hundred years it is likely that seasonal practices varied over time.{{sfn|Scarre|2005|p=397}}\n\nIt has been suggested that the antler frontlets were used as a hunting disguise, or in some form of [[ritual]] practice. Recent work suggests that these, along with other objects made from red deer antler, appear to have been respectfully deposited at the lake edge due to the spiritual significance of red deer to the people who occupied the site.\n\nAnthony Legge and Peter Rowley-Conway re-examined the animal bones located at the site. They found strong evidence to suggest that the site was used only in late spring and summer; evidence that the cull of red and roe deer was biased towards three- and one-year-old animals respectively; revision of available meat; reduction in scale of occupation; no bias towards hunting of male red deer, and tentatively suggested that the site was used as a hunting camp.<ref>Star Carr Revisited</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{cite journal|last1=Boreham|first1=S|last2=Conneller|first2=C|last3=Milner|first3=N|last4=Needham|first4=A|last5=Boreham|first5=J|last6=Rolfe|first6=CJ|title=Geochemical indicators of preservation status and site deterioration at Star Carr|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|date=2011|volume=30|issue=10|pages=2833\u20132857|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2011.01.016}}\n*{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/excavationsatsta0000clar |url-access=registration |quote=moore. |title=Excavations at Star Carr: An Early Mesolithic Site at Seamer Near Scarborough, Yorkshire |first=Grahame |last=Clark |authorlink=Grahame Clark |publisher=[[CUP Archive]] |date=1954 |accessdate=15 August 2014 |pp=xvii\u2013xviii |isbn=9780521083942|ref=harv}}\n*Conneller, C., 2004.

It is around five miles ({{convert|5|mi|abbr=out|disp=output only|0}}) south of [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]].<ref name=Pastscape>{{cite PastScape|mnumber=80206 |mname= Star Carr|accessdate=15 January 2008}}</ref>\nIt is generally regarded as the most important and informative Mesolithic site in [[Great Britain]]. It is as important to the Mesolithic period as [[Stonehenge]] is to the [[Neolithic]] period or [[Scandinavian York]] is to understanding [[Viking Age]] Britain.\n\nThe site was occupied during the early Mesolithic archaeological period, which coincided with the [[preboreal]] and [[boreal (period)|boreal]] climatic periods. Though the [[Last Glacial Period|ice age]] had ended and temperatures were close to modern averages, sea levels had not yet risen sufficiently to separate Britain from continental [[Europe]]. Highlights among the finds include Britain\u2019s oldest structure, 21 [[red deer]] stag skull-caps that may have been headdresses and nearly 200 projectile, or harpoon, points made of red deer [[antler]]. These organic materials were preserved due to having been buried in waterlogged [[peat]]. Normally all that remains on Mesolithic sites are [[stone tool]]s.\n\nExcavation of the site began in 1948, a year after artefacts were first noticed by an amateur archaeologist. The site is most famous for some of the extremely rare [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] discovered during the original excavations but its importance has been reinforced by new understandings of the nature and extent of the Mesolithic archaeology in the area and reinterpretations of the original material.\n\n==General information==\n\n===Environmental context===\nStar Carr now lies under farmland at the eastern end of the [[Vale of Pickering]]. During the Mesolithic the site was near the outflow at the western end of a palaeolake, known as [[Lake Flixton]].{{Sfn|Mellars|Dark|1998|pp=4,13}} At the end of the last ice age a combination of glacial and post-glacial [[geomorphology]] caused the area to drain to the west (away from the shortest-distance to the [[North Sea]] at [[Filey]]). The basin filled by Lake Flixton was probably created by glacial 'scarring'.\n\nThe site is preserved due to Lake Flixton having been in-filled with peat during the course of the Mesolithic. Waterlogged peat prevents organic finds from oxidising and has led to some of the best preservation conditions possible (such conditions have preserved the famous [[bog bodies]] found in other parts of northern Europe).\nAs a result of such good conditions archaeologists were able to recover bone, antler and wood in addition to the flints that are normally all that is left on sites from this period.\n\nDuring the period of Mesolithic occupation the area surrounding the lake would have been a mixed forest of [[birch]], [[aspen]] and [[willow]].{{Sfn|Mellars|Dark|1998|pp=147\u2013161}} The lake edge and shallows would have been full of reeds, water lily and other aquatic plants and lake levels would have changed dynamically in response to rainfall or snow-melt.\n\nThese and many other plants would have formed the base of a complex [[food web]]. The [[mammal]]s that we have evidence for include [[herbivore]]s such as [[beaver]], red deer, [[roe deer]], [[moose|elk]] \n, [[aurochs]], [[wild boar]], [[hare]] and [[carnivore]]s such as [[wolf]], [[lynx]], [[bear]], [[fox]], [[pine marten]], [[badger]] and [[hedgehog]].{{Sfn|Milner|2006|p=72}}\n\n===Key artefacts===\nAlong with the flints that are characteristic of [[Mesolithic]] sites, there were a large number of objects made of red deer and elk antler, elk bone, aurochs bone and one piece of bird bone.{{sfn|Clark|1954|pp=115\u2013164}} Rarer objects included worked [[amber]], [[shale]], [[haematite]], [[iron pyrites]], a decorated [[pendant]], thought to be the oldest known Mesolithic art in Britain <ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.11141/ia.40.8 | issue=40 | title=A Unique Engraved Shale Pendant from the Site of Star Carr: the oldest Mesolithic art in Britain | year=2016 | journal=Internet Archaeology | last1 = Milner | first1 = Nicky| doi-access=free }}</ref> and tightly-rolled pieces of birch-bark and pieces of birch-resin pitch or tar and worked wood.\nThe flint found at Star Carr came from nearby beaches, which at time of occupation would have been about {{convert|10|to|20|km|0|abbr=on}} distant, and also from the [[Yorkshire Wolds]] immediately to the south of the site.\n\nThe two most outstanding categories of finds are the 'barbed points' and 'antler frontlets'. The barbed points are made of the antler of red deer stags. They are between {{convert|8|cm|in}} and {{convert|38|cm|in}} in length{{sfn|Clark|1954|p=123}} and the 195 examples found at Star Carr account for more than 95% of the total number from the British Mesolithic. Many of the barbed points and antler frontlets appear to be deliberately broken. The antler frontlets are made from red deer stag (male) skulls with the antlers still attached. The 21 antler frontlets are sufficiently complete to see how they have been manufactured: two holes were perforated through the skull with a [[flint]] tool and the inside of the skull cap was smoothed. The antlers on each frontlet has been carefully trimmed maybe to reduce weight. It seems very likely that these modifications are designed to allow the frontlets to be used as headgear. Finds from the site are now divided between four institutions: The [[British Museum]], the [[Yorkshire Museum]] in York, the University [[Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Cambridge|Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]] at Cambridge and the [[Rotunda Museum|Scarborough Museum]].<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=5702&plaA=5702-3-1 British Museum Collection]</ref><ref name=\"sc2017\">{{cite web|title=Exhibitions|url=http://www.starcarr.com/exhibitions.html|website=Star Carr Archaeology Project|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Star Carr headdress cropped.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Red Deer Stag skull with holes]]\n[[File:Star Carr spear tips 01.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Barbed points]]\n\n===Evidence of structures===\nPost holes, a sunken area and concentrations of flints, burning and other artefacts indicate the presence of a structure approximately {{convert|3.5|m|ft}} wide. The posts were almost certainly made of wood and roughly {{convert|20|cm|in}} in diameter there may have been as many as 18 of them and the holes indicated that several may have been replaced over the course of the structure's use.\nIt is impossible to know the form or materials from which the walls and/or roof would have been made. They may have used [[Hide (skin)|hides]], [[thatch]], [[Peat|turf]] or [[Bark (botany)|bark]] on a conical ([[teepee]]-like) or rounded ([[wigwam]]-like) frame. There is no reason to suppose that the same materials and form would have been used for the structure's entire life-span. There was evidence that the floor was covered with a layer of moss, reeds and other soft plant materials {{convert|20|cm|in}}\u2013{{convert|30|cm|in}} deep.\n[[Radiocarbon]] dates indicated a use-life of between 200 and 500&nbsp;years.\nThe structure has been compared to the Mesolithic structure found at [[Howick, Northumberland|Howick]], Northumberland and British [[Iron Age]] [[Roundhouse (dwelling)|roundhouses]].\n\nA large wooden platform has been discovered nearby on the shore of the former lake \u2013 the earliest known example of carpentry in Europe, though its purpose is as yet unknown. Timbers of Aspen and Willow were split along the grain using wedges (probably made of wood and antler); these were then laid in the boggy areas at the lake shore, presumably to provide firm footing.\nThe extent of the wooden platform is not known but it may be a significantly larger and more complex undertaking than the house-like structure.\n\n===Chronology===\nCurrent [[radiocarbon]] dates from the site indicate occupation first commenced between 9335\u20139275&nbsp;BC, lasting for a period of around 800 years until 8525\u20138440&nbsp;BC.{{sfn|Milner, Conneller and Taylor|2018|pp=225\u2013244}} However, such occupations may have been episodic in nature, varying in intensity between different periods.{{sfn|Milner, Conneller and Taylor|2018|pp=225\u2013244}}\n\n==History of investigations==\n\n===Discovery and initial excavations===\nStar Carr was discovered in 1947 when John Moore, an amateur archaeologist, noticed flints in the exposed soil of several recently dredged ditches in the eastern Vale of Pickering. One of these sites, bordering on the [[River Derwent, Yorkshire#Course and character of the Derwent catchment area|New Hertford River]] was to the south of Star Carr Farm. Moore decided to excavate a small trench at Star Carr in 1948 as part of a series of investigations. On the discovery of intact organic remains Moore contacted Professor [[Grahame Clark]] of the [[University of Cambridge]] via [[Harry Godwin]] and the curator of the [[Rotunda Museum|Scarborough Museum]], [[Arthur Roy Clapham]].{{Sfn|Clark|1954|pp=xvii\u2013xviii}}<ref>{{cite news|last=Alleyne |first=Richard |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/7937240/Oldest-house-in-Britain-discovered-to-be-11500-years-old.html |title=Oldest house in Britain discovered to be 11,500 years old |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=10 August 2010 |accessdate=15 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nClark began his investigation with the explicit aim of building a more detailed picture of the Mesolithic environment and the ways in which people used it.<ref>Clark 1972, p. 7{{Full citation needed|date=October 2012}}</ref> The organic preservation enabled the recovery of the plant and animal remains necessary for this. Clark excavated from 1949 to 1951. Clark's 1954 publication of these excavations is a seminal text in the study of the British Mesolithic and prehistory generally.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nClark believed he had uncovered the entirety of the site and believed Star Carr could be used as a [[type-site]] for the British Mesolithic. He drew parallels between the finds at Star Carr and the site of [[Maglemosian|Maglemose]] in Denmark. It is now recognised that many of Clark\u2019s inferences were incorrect but the excavation remains one of the most important in the study of British prehistory ever undertaken.\n\n===Further investigations: The Lake Flixton Landscape===\nIn 1977 archaeologists excavated [[Iron Age]], [[Bronze Age]] and Mesolithic material from [[Seamer, Scarborough|Seamer]] Carr, just to the north of Star Carr. These excavations were conducted in advance of the Seamer Carr landfill site. The discovery of Mesolithic material led to a new series of investigations around Lake Flixton directed by [[Tim Schadla-Hall]] (currently [[University College London]]). This team returned to Star Carr in 1985 and 1989.<ref>{{harvnb|Mellars|Dark|1998|pp=}}{{page needed|date=August 2014}}</ref>\n\nThis project investigated the archaeology and ecology of the wider landscape around Lake Flixton and found several more Mesolithic sites but none with as many of the unusual artefacts (such as barbed points and antler frontlets) discovered at Star Carr.\n\n===The latest investigations===\nIn the 2000s new excavations began at Star Carr. This reinvestigation is being directed by [[Nicky Milner]] ([[Department of Archaeology at the University of York|University of York]]), Chantal Conneller ([[University of Manchester]]) and Barry Taylor ([[University of Chester]]). This ongoing project has reinvestigated Clark's excavations and also excavated the dry-land, discovering the structure.\n\n[[File:Star Carr Engraved Pendant.gif|thumb|right|Animated image showing the sequence of engravings on a pendant excavated from the Mesolithic archaeological site of Starr Carr in 2015 <ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Morgan | first1 = C. | last2 = Scholma-Mason | first2 = N. | year = 2017 | title = Animated GIFs as Expressive Visual Narratives and Expository Devices in Archaeology | url = | journal = Internet Archaeology | volume = | issue = 44| page = | doi = 10.11141/ia.44.11 | doi-access = free }}</ref>]]\n\nMost significantly, recent [[geochemical]] investigations have demonstrated that the preservation conditions have deteriorated. The result of this is that any remaining organic artefacts will be far less informative than those discovered by previous excavation projects. Though the reasons for this remain somewhat unclear, it appears that the acidity of the groundwater has massively increased in the last few years.\n\nA decorated pendant (the [[Star Carr Pendant]]), thought to be the oldest known Mesolithic art in Britain, was found at the site in 2015.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.11141/ia.40.8 | issue=40 | title=A Unique Engraved Shale Pendant from the Site of Star Carr: the oldest Mesolithic art in Britain | year=2016 | journal=Internet Archaeology | last1 = Milner | first1 = Nicky| doi-access=free }}</ref>  The 11,000 year old object has been on display at the [[Yorkshire Museum]] with other finds from the site since 2016.<ref>{{cite news | title = Yorkshire Stone Age pendant goes on display | publisher = [[BBC News Online]] | date = 26 February 2016 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-york-north-yorkshire-35669267 | accessdate = 26 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Interpretive debates==\nClark, the original excavator, believed the Mesolithic people would have lived on a brushwood platform on the edge of the former Lake Flixton.{{sfn|Clark|1954|p=xvii}} Recent excavations have revealed that people lived on the dry land upslope of the lake and various activities were carried out at the lake edge.\n\nThere is much debate about the time of year the site was occupied. Mesolithic people hunted a number of animals including red and roe deer, elk, aurochs and wild boar but there are various seasonal assessments and as the site was occupied over several hundred years it is likely that seasonal practices varied over time.{{sfn|Scarre|2005|p=397}}\n\nIt has been suggested that the antler frontlets were used as a hunting disguise, or in some form of [[ritual]] practice. Recent work suggests that these, along with other objects made from red deer antler, appear to have been respectfully deposited at the lake edge due to the spiritual significance of red deer to the people who occupied the site.\n\nAnthony Legge and Peter Rowley-Conway re-examined the animal bones located at the site. They found strong evidence to suggest that the site was used only in late spring and summer; evidence that the cull of red and roe deer was biased towards three- and one-year-old animals respectively; revision of available meat; reduction in scale of occupation; no bias towards hunting of male red deer, and tentatively suggested that the site was used as a hunting camp.<ref>Star Carr Revisited</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{cite journal|last1=Boreham|first1=S|last2=Conneller|first2=C|last3=Milner|first3=N|last4=Needham|first4=A|last5=Boreham|first5=J|last6=Rolfe|first6=CJ|title=Geochemical indicators of preservation status and site deterioration at Star Carr|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|date=2011|volume=30|issue=10|pages=2833\u20132857|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2011.01.016}}\n*{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/excavationsatsta0000clar |url-access=registration |quote=moore. |title=Excavations at Star Carr: An Early Mesolithic Site at Seamer Near Scarborough, Yorkshire |first=Grahame |last=Clark |authorlink=Grahame Clark |publisher=[[CUP Archive]] |date=1954 |accessdate=15 August 2014 |pp=xvii\u2013xviii |isbn=9780521083942|ref=harv}}\n*Conneller, C., 2004.
