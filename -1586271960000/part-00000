The first lineup of the band also featured Lazar Male\u0161evi\u0107 (bass guitar) and Sini\u0161a Lu\u010di\u0107 (drums). In the beginning, the band had several lineup changes, before the first consistent lineup was formed. It featured Mumin, Medan, Vladimir Jovanov (also known as Menadner Protector, a former Necrophobic member, bass guitar), Mario Kalin (guitar), and Robert Radi\u0107 (a former [[Kontraritam]], [[La Strada (band)|La Strada]] and [[Obojeni Program]] member, drums).\n\nInitially, the band was [[punk blues]]-oriented. As the band's songs featured [[English language]] lyrics, and as their first releases were released through [[independent record label]]s, the band initially did not manage to break through mainstream media. They released their debut [[audio cassette]] entitled ''There no Centuries'' in 1988 through Mr Montenegro Records. In 1993, they released their second album ''Everclassic'' through Music Yuser,<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/Love-Hunters-Everclassic/release/1185055 ''Everclassic'' at Discogs]</ref> and, in 1995, ''Oh, Evolution'' through the same record label. After these three releases the band gained a cult status in Novi Sad.\n\nDuring the spring of 1996 the band released the album ''Donau'' (through Music Yuser) which featured almost all songs from the previous two albums.<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/Love-Hunters-Donau/release/1083619 ''Donau'' at Discogs]</ref> At the same time, the album ''Total Rickvertzzo'', which featured demo recordings made during the 1987-1991 period, was released.<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/Love-Hunters-Total-Rickverzzo/release/1033859 ''Total Rickvertzzo'' at Discogs]</ref> The various artists live album ''\u010cetiri godine na Golom otoku'' (trans. ''Four Years at [[Goli otok]]'') featured recordings of their songs \"Kamikaze\" and \"There's Something in the Dark\", recorded at the concert in Klub Studenata Tehnike on December 9, 1995. At the beginning of May 1996, the band, alongside [[Goblini]], [[Svarog (band)|Svarog]] and [[Ni\u0161ta Ali Logopedi]], performed in [[Slovenia]] as a part of the action entitled Srpski rock 'n' roll udarac (''Serbian Rock 'n' Roll Strike''). On June 29, the band performed as the opening band on [[Partibrejkers]] comeback concert held at [[Ta\u0161majdan Sports Centre|Ta\u0161majdan Stadium]].\n\nOn September 21, 1996 the band held a concert in [[Belgrade]]'s [[Studentski Kulturni Centar|SKC]]. The band, under the name Live Hunters, released thirteen songs recorded on this concert and on a concert held in [[Zrenjanin]] on the live album ''Out Of Tune'', through [[Komuna Belgrade]] at the end of 1996.<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/Live-Hunters-Out-Of-Tune/release/1083572 ''Out Of Tune'' at Discogs]</ref> During the April 1997, in [[Netherlands]], the band recorded the album ''Azimuth'', released by Komuna Belgrade during the same year.<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/Love-Hunters-Azimuth/release/1083580 ''Azimuth'' at Discogs]</ref> The album featured rerecorded track \"Goodbye Love\".

As the band's songs featured [[English language]] lyrics, and as their first releases were released through [[independent record label]]s, the band initially did not manage to break through mainstream media.

''Four Years at [[Goli otok]]'') featured recordings of their songs \"Kamikaze\" and \"There's Something in the Dark\", recorded at the concert in Klub Studenata Tehnike on December 9, 1995. At the beginning of May 1996, the band, alongside [[Goblini]], [[Svarog (band)|Svarog]] and [[Ni\u0161ta Ali Logopedi]], performed in [[Slovenia]] as a part of the action entitled Srpski rock 'n' roll udarac (''Serbian Rock 'n' Roll Strike'').

For most of 2003, Howard Dean had been the apparent front-runner for the nomination, performing strongly in most polls and leading the pack in fund-raising. However, Kerry won the [[Iowa caucus]]es and [[New Hampshire primary]], which gave him enough momentum to carry the majority of the rest of the states.\n\n===Election issues===\nAccording to exit polls taking during the [[Iowa Democratic caucuses, 2008|Iowa Caucuses]], the top 4 issues were ranked as follows:<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/primaries/pages/epolls/IA/index.html| title = CNN.com 2004 Primaries | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\n# Economy/Jobs (29% of Respondents)\n# Health Care/Medicine (28% of Respondents)\n# The war in Iraq (14% of Respondents)\n# Education (14% of Respondents)\n\n====Economy====\nDespite being characterized by many as an election on [[Iraq]], the economy and jobs were repeatedly cited as voters' top or one of top three concerns during the course of the primary season. In [[Iowa]], of those who cited the [[economy]] as their most important issue, 34% supported Kerry, while 33% supported Edwards, with Dean trailing at 16% and Gephardt at 12%.\n\nEventual nominee [[John Kerry]], much like other Democrats adopted policy stances of tax-cuts for the middle class, increased spending for Social Security, and assisting small businesses.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/special/president/issues/index.kerry.html| title = CNN.com Specials | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref> On the aspect of job creation, Kerry strongly supported the creation and safety of infrastructure-related jobs, like those in the railroad industry. During the course of the primary Kerry continued to advocate positions such as fiscal responsibility and end state fiscal crises by giving states increased fiscal aid.\n\nRunner up [[John Edwards]] ran a position of support for the [[middle class]] as well as [[budget]] caps and enforcement.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/special/president/issues/index.edwards.html| title = CNN.com Specials | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref> Strongly opposing Social Security privatization, and interested in middle class tax cuts, Edwards's main economic theme was support for the middle class touting his own struggle, growing up the son of a poor mill worker in [[South Carolina]]. Another major component of Edwards's message was to be able to reinstate fiscal responsibility.\n\n[[Howard Dean]], despite taking many of the same positions of his rivals including Edwards and Kerry, had a starkly different approach on the issue of Social Security and tax cuts.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/special/president/issues/index.dean.html| title = CNN.com Specials | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref> On taxes, Dean favored repealing the [[Bush Tax cuts]] not only for the wealthiest of Americans as Senator Edwards and Senator Kerry proposed, but for all, including middle and lower classes.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/12/us/tax-cuts-split-the-democratic-presidential-field.html |title=Tax Cuts Split the Democratic Presidential Field |last=Rosenbaum |first=David E. |date=2003-09-12 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2017-12-09 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n==== Iraq War ====\nAfter the 9/11 attacks, the Bush administration argued that the need to remove [[Saddam Hussein]] from power in [[Iraq]] had now become urgent. Over the course of several months, Bush presented several premises for war, but the turning point was that Saddam's regime had tried to acquire [[nuclear material]] and had not properly accounted for [[biological weapons|biological]] and [[chemical weapons|chemical]] material it was known to have possessed, potential [[weapons of mass destruction]] (WMD) in violation of [[Iraq sanctions|U.N. sanctions]].  This\nsituation escalated to the point that the United States assembled a group of about forty nations, including the [[United Kingdom]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]], and [[Poland]], which Bush called the \"[[coalition of the willing]]\", to invade Iraq.\n\nThe coalition invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003.  Most contenders for the nomination were supportive of the effort.  Only Dean and Kucinich firmly questioned the aims and tactics of the administration, setting themselves apart in the eyes of war protesters.  However, speaking before an audience in [[Peterborough, New Hampshire]], John Kerry said, \"We need a regime change not just in Iraq. We need a regime change here in the United States.\"<ref>{{cite news | last=Poor | first=Eric | title=Kerry calls for new U.S. leadership |date=2003-04-03 | publisher=Monadnock Ledger | url=http://www.mledger.com/2003/archives/1_news_040303.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040917004530/http://www.mledger.com/2003/archives/1_news_040303.shtml | archivedate=2004-09-17}}</ref>  Republicans criticized Kerry for speaking out against a wartime president.<ref>{{cite news | last=Pickler | first=Nedra | title=POLITICAL NOTEBOOK: Hastert, Delay assail Kerry speech; Edwards chats with Bush; Dean writing a book | date=2003-04-03 | agency=Associated Press | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/news/archive/2003/04/03/national1601EST0726.DTL | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030624183241/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fnews%2Farchive%2F2003%2F04%2F03%2Fnational1601EST0726.DTL | archivedate=2003-06-24 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe invasion was swift, with the collapse of the Iraq government and the [[military of Iraq]] in about three weeks. The oil infrastructure of Iraq was rapidly secured with limited damage in that time. On May 1, [[George W. Bush]] landed on the aircraft carrier [[USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72)|USS ''Abraham Lincoln'']] in a [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed]] [[S-3 Viking]], where he gave a speech announcing the end of major combat in the Iraq war. Clearly visible in the background was a banner stating \"Mission Accomplished\". Bush's landing was criticized by opponents as being overly theatrical and expensive. The banner, made by [[White House]] personnel (according to a [[CNN]] story:<ref>{{cite news | last=Bash | first=Dana  | title=White House pressed on 'mission accomplished' sign |date=2003-10-29 | publisher=CNN | url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/10/28/mission.accomplished/}}\n</ref>) and placed there by the U.S. Navy, was criticized as premature. Nonetheless, Bush's approval rating in the month of May rode at 66%, according to a CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll.<ref>{{cite news | title=Bush Jumpstarts '04 Fundraising |date=2003-05-24 | agency=Associated Press | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/05/24/politics/main555427.shtml | work=CBS News}}</ref>\n\nOn May 3, 2003, Democrats met at the [[University of South Carolina Columbia|University of South Carolina]] in the first formal debate between the nine challengers for the nomination. The candidates disagreed on the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|war against Iraq]], health insurance, and even President Bush's tax cuts, but united in criticizing Bush's handling of the economy.\n\n=== Dean emerges as front-runner ===\n{{main|John Kerry 2004 presidential campaign| John Edwards 2004 presidential campaign| Howard Dean 2004 presidential campaign| Wesley Clark 2004 presidential campaign}}\n[[Image:Howard Dean declaration of candidacy June 2003.jpg|thumb|300px|Howard Dean declared his candidacy on June 23, 2003, winning the MoveOn \"primary\" days later. His campaign would go on to lead most polls and raise the most money in the latter part of 2003.]]\n\nOn May 31, 2002, [[Vermont]] Governor [[Howard Dean]] formed a presidential exploratory committee.  Though this was almost two years before the Iowa Caucus, Dean hoped the early start would give him some much needed name recognition.  As a governor of a small state, Dean was not well known outside of New England.\n\nIn December of that year, [[John Kerry|John F. Kerry]], [[United States Senate|U.S. senator]] from [[Massachusetts]], announced on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Meet the Press]]'' his plans to form an exploratory committee for a possible 2004 presidential run, anticipating a formal announcement \"down the road some months\".  Kerry's experience as a decorated [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] veteran generated some excitement among Democrats tired of being on the defensive about their candidates' suitability in the role of \"commander in chief\".\n\nTwo weeks later, former [[Vice President of the United States of America|Vice President]] and [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential candidate]] [[Al Gore]] announced on the [[CBS]] program ''[[60 Minutes]]'' that he would not seek election to the presidency in 2004. Gore had recently wrapped up a nationwide book tour and had been widely expected to run.\n\nOther potential candidates were likely waiting to see what Gore's plans were, and thus the floodgates opened in January 2003. Senator [[Joe Lieberman|Joseph Lieberman]], Gore's 2000 vice presidential running mate,  had previously promised not to run should Gore seek their party's nomination. Freed from that obligation, Lieberman announced his intention to run.  Additionally, many other candidates announced their intention to form committees (a formality usually indicating an official run): U.S. Sen. [[John Edwards|John R. Edwards]] of [[North Carolina]], U.S. Rep. [[Dick Gephardt|Richard A. \"Dick\" Gephardt]] of [[Missouri]], and Reverend [[Al Sharpton]] of [[New York (state)|New York]].  In February, more candidates announced their intentions: former Senator from [[Illinois]] [[Carol Moseley Braun]], U.S. Representative from [[Ohio]] [[Dennis Kucinich]], and [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Bob Graham]] of [[Florida]].\n\nThere were other potential candidates for whom some speculation was buzzing about a potential run. These candidates felt it necessary to officially state that they would not seek the party nomination. These included [[United States Senate]] Minority Leader [[Tom Daschle]], U.S. Senator [[Christopher Dodd]] of [[Connecticut]], and former U.S. Senator [[Gary Hart]] from [[Colorado]].\n\nIn April, Democratic fund-raising totals for the first quarter of 2003 were reported. John Edwards raised $7.4 million, John Kerry raised $7.0 million, Dick Gephardt raised $3.5 million, Joe Lieberman raised $3.0 million, Howard Dean raised $2.6 million, Bob Graham raised $1.1 million, and Dennis Kucinich and Carol Moseley Braun raised less than $1 million each.\n\nIn June 2003, [[Howard Dean]] aired the first [[television]] advertising of the 2004 campaign, spending more than $300,000.  During that time, he formally announced his run for president, filing to form a presidential election campaign with the FEC.  Later that month, liberal advocacy website [[MoveOn]] held the first ever online Democratic \"primary\", which lasted just over 48 hours. It was an unofficial and nonbinding affair, but with important symbolic and financial value.  Of 317,647 votes, [[Howard Dean]] received 44%, [[Dennis Kucinich]] 24%, and [[John Kerry]] 16%.  Had any candidate received 50% of the vote, the candidate would have received MoveOn's endorsement and financial support.  Instead, MoveOn supported all the candidates.<ref>{{cite web | title=Report on the 2003 MoveOn.org Political Action Primary | work=MoveOn.org | url=http://moveon.org/pac/primary/report.html | accessdate=September 28, 2005 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050929062844/http://moveon.org/pac/primary/report.html | archivedate=September 29, 2005 }}</ref>\n\nIn July, the Democratic fund-raising numbers for the second quarter of 2003 were reported and announced.  Howard Dean surprised many raising $7.5 million, John Kerry raised $6 million, while John Edwards and Joseph Lieberman raised roughly $5 million each.  Dean's strength as a fund-raiser was attributed mainly to his innovative embrace of the Internet for campaigning.  The majority of his donations came from individual Dean supporters, who came to be known as ''Deanites'', or, more commonly, ''[[Deaniac]]s''.  His campaign's innovative use of the [[Internet]] helped to build a strongly supportive [[grassroots]] constituency, much of which remained intensely loyal to him long after the end of his candidacy.\n\nBy autumn of 2003, Dean had become the apparent front-runner for the Democratic nomination, performing strongly in most polls.  Generally regarded as a pragmatic [[centrist]] during his time as governor, Dean emerged during his presidential campaign as something of a [[populism|populist]], denouncing the policies of the Bush administration (especially the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]) as well as fellow Democrats, who, in his view, failed to strongly oppose them.\n\nDuring his presidential campaign, critics on the right labeled Dean's political views as those of an extreme [[Liberalism|liberal]]; however, in liberal [[Vermont]], Dean, long known as a staunch advocate of fiscal restraint, was regarded as a moderate. Many critics on the left, who supported fellow Democrat [[Dennis Kucinich]] or independent [[Ralph Nader]], charged that, at heart, Dean was a \"[[Rockefeller Republican]]\"&mdash;socially liberal, while fiscally conservative.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jan/17/politics |title=Howard Dean: 'the flip flop candidate' |last=Raban |first=Jonathan |date=2004-01-17 |work=The Guardian |access-date=2017-12-09 |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n=== Wesley Clark enters ===\nOver the summer of 2003, several organized groups began a [[United States|nationwide]] campaign to \"[[Political draft|draft]]\" retired [[general|four-star general]] [[Wesley Clark]] for the Democratic Party's nomination for the 2004 presidential election. CNN on August 13 showed a [[Television commercial|commercial]] by one of these groups and interviewed Clark. He disavowed any connection with the \"draft Clark\" groups, but said he had been considering his position and that within a few weeks he would likely make public his decision on whether to\nrun. He also fueled speculation with a television interview in which he first declared himself a Democrat.\n\nOn September 17, 2003, in Little Rock, Arkansas, Clark announced his intention to run in the [[U.S. Democratic Party Presidential Primary, 2004|presidential primary election]] for the Democratic Party nomination, becoming the tenth and last Democrat to do so (coming many months after the others): \"My name is Wes Clark.  I am from Little Rock, Arkansas, and I am here to announce that I intend to seek the presidency of the United States of America.\"  He said, \"We're going to run a campaign that will move this country forward, not back.\"\n\nHis campaign focused on themes of leadership and patriotism; early campaign ads relied heavily on biography. His late start left him with relatively few detailed policy proposals. This weakness was apparent in his first few debates, although he soon presented a range of position papers, including a major tax-relief plan. Nevertheless, many Democrats flocked to his campaign.  They were drawn by his military background, and saw such foreign policy credentials as a valuable asset in challenging [[George W. Bush]] post-[[September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attacks|September 11]]. Advisors and supporters portrayed him as more electable than [[Howard Dean]], who was still the front-runner for the party's nomination.  Despite the burst of enthusiasm for Clark in late 2003, Dean maintained a strong lead in the polls for the latter half of the year.  Clark won the Democratic Presidential Primary in [[Oklahoma]], the only state carried by Clark in the primary election.\n\nCriticism of Clark began almost the moment he entered the race. Originally heralded as an antiwar general, he stumbled in the first few days of his candidacy. He was perceived as changing his answer on how he would have voted on the Iraq war resolution.  His supporters argued that his perceived indecision was due to lack of experience with the media and their insistence on short \"sound bite\" answers.\n\n=== Iowa and New Hampshire ===\nThroughout the early campaigning season, the [[Iowa Democratic caucuses, 2004|Iowa caucuses]] appeared to be a two-way contest between former [[Vermont]] Governor [[Howard Dean]] and [[Missouri]] Congressman [[Richard Gephardt]]. Dean, the national front runner, had been able to pour money into [[Iowa]] and [[New Hampshire]].

This, along with the resurgence of John Kerry and the emergence of John Edwards as major contenders in Iowa, put the Gephardt and Dean campaigns on edge.\n\nA poll released by the ''[[Des Moines Register]]'' days before the caucus was held showed Dean and Gephardt had lost all of their lead in Iowa. In the poll, Kerry led with 26% of those surveyed, Edwards came in second with 23%, Dean came in third with 20%, and Gephardt came in fourth with 18%.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/primaries/pages/misc/iowa.recap.html| title = CNN.com 2004 Primaries | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn caucus night, as results were being tallied, it became evident that Kerry and Edwards were in a battle for first and Dean and Gephardt were in a battle for third.\n[[File:Iowa Democratic presidential caucuses, 2004.svg|thumb|Iowa results by county{{legend|#2A7FFF|John Kerry}}{{legend|#ff7f2a|John Edwards}}{{legend|#00ff66|Howard Dean}}{{legend|#666666|Tie}}\n]]\n<nowiki> </nowiki>After all votes were tallied, John Kerry received 38% of the delegates, John Edwards received 32%, Howard Dean received 18%, and Richard Gephardt received 11%.\n\nAfter his poor showing, Gephardt dropped out of the race.<ref>{{ cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/01/19/elec04.prez.gephardt/index.html| title = Gephardt to drop out of race | work=CNN | date=January 18, 2004 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref> Kerry and Edwards claimed newfound momentum, while Dean attempted to downplay the results.\n\nIn the [[2004 New Hampshire Democratic primary|New Hampshire primary]], Kerry was able to defeat Howard Dean once again, beating him 38%-26%.

He finished with 12% in the [[New Hampshire primary]] one week later, essentially tied for third-place position with retired general [[Wesley Clark]]. The following week, Edwards won in [[South Carolina]] and nearly beat Clark in [[Oklahoma]].\n\n[[Image:John-Edwards-Shakes-Hands.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Edwards on the campaign trail in 2004.]]\nAfter Dean's withdrawal from the contest, Edwards became the only major challenger to Kerry for the nomination. However, Kerry continued to dominate, taking in wins in [[Michigan]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Maine]], [[Tennessee]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Nevada]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Utah]], [[Hawaii]], and [[Idaho]]. Remarking on an unexpectedly strong finish in [[Wisconsin]] on February 17, Edwards humorously cautioned Kerry: \"Objects in your mirror may be closer than they appear.\" Many other candidates dropped out during this time, leaving only Kerry, Edwards, Sharpton and Kucinich in the running. Dean, while not officially running, did not release his delegates, and still put in a strong showing considering that he was no longer mounting an official campaign.\n\nEdwards maintained a positive campaign and largely avoided attacking Kerry until a February 29, 2004, debate in [[New York City]], where he attempted to put Kerry on the defensive by characterizing the front-runner as a \"Washington insider\" and by mocking Kerry's plan to form a committee to examine trade agreements.\n\nIn [[Super Tuesday]], March 2, Kerry won decisive victories in the [[California]], [[Connecticut]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Maryland]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Ohio]], and [[Rhode Island]] primaries and the [[Minnesota]] caucuses. Dean, despite having withdrawn from the race two weeks earlier, won his home state of Vermont. Edwards finished only slightly behind Kerry in Georgia but, failing to win a single state, chose to withdraw, making Kerry the [[presumptive nominee]]. President [[George W. Bush|Bush]] called Senator Kerry to congratulate him that evening.\n\nOn March 11, after meetings with Democratic [[superdelegate]]s in [[Washington, D.C.]], and former [[primary election]] opponents, Kerry accumulated the 2,162 delegates required to clinch the nomination. The [[Democratic National Committee|DNC's]] website acknowledged him as the party's nominee at that time, four and a half months prior to the [[2004 Democratic National Convention|Convention]].\n\n''See also the [[John Kerry 2004 presidential campaign]]''\n\n=== Nomination ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:KerryatDNC.jpg|thumb|238px|Kerry gave a salute and proclaimed, \"I'm John Kerry and I'm reporting for duty.\"|{{deletable image-caption|1=Tuesday, 19 August 2008}}]] -->\n{{details|2004 Democratic National Convention}}\n\nOn July 6, John Kerry selected John Edwards as his running mate shortly before the 2004 Democratic National Convention in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], held later that month.  Senators Kerry and Edwards were formally nominated by the Democratic Party at the convention.  The Kerry/Edwards ticket was on the ballot in all 50 states, plus the District of Columbia.  In [[New York (state)|New York]], the ticket was also on the ballot as candidates of the [[Working Families Party]].\n\n[[Governor of New Mexico|New Mexico Governor]] [[Bill Richardson (politician)|Bill Richardson]] served as chairman of the convention while former presidential advisor to [[Bill Clinton]], [[Lottie Shackelford]],  served as vice chairman.  Defining moments of the 2004 Democratic National Convention included the featured [[keynote speech]] of [[Barack Obama]], a [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]] native and candidate for the [[United States Senate]] from [[Illinois]], [[Bill Clinton]]'s opening night speech and the confirmation of the [[Democratic Party presidential nomination, 2004|nomination]] of [[John Kerry]] as the candidate for president and of [[John Edwards]] as the candidate for [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]].  Kerry made his [[Vietnam War]] experience a prominent theme.  In accepting the nomination, he began his speech with \"I'm John Kerry and I'm reporting for duty.\"\n\nKerry and Edwards faced incumbents [[George W. Bush]] and [[Dick Cheney]] of the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] in the [[2004 U.S. presidential election|2004 presidential election]].  Following his official nomination at the Convention, Kerry received only a small [[convention bounce|bounce]] in the polls and remained \"neck and neck\" with Bush.  This was the first time in recent political history that a candidate failed to receive a substantial boost in post-convention poll numbers. Some political pundits attributed this small boost to the unusually small number of undecided voters as compared with previous presidential elections.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Inskeep |first1=Steve |title=Polls: Kerry Got Little Bounce from Boston |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=3809479 |website=NPR |accessdate=28 January 2019 |language=en |date=2 August 2004}}</ref>\n\nThe general election was won by Bush, who defeated Kerry.  The election was fought primarily on the issue of the conduct of the [[War on Terrorism|War on Terror]].  Bush defended the actions of his administration, while Kerry contended that the war had been fought incompetently, and that the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq War]] was a distraction from the War on Terror, not a part of it.\n\n== Overview ==\n{| style=\"margin:auto\"\n|{{#tag:timeline|ImageSize=width:800 height:auto barincrement:20\nPlotArea = top:10 bottom:25 right:10 left:10\nAlignBars =

For most of 2003, Howard Dean had been the apparent front-runner for the nomination, performing strongly in most polls and leading the pack in fund-raising. However, Kerry won the [[Iowa caucus]]es and [[New Hampshire primary]], which gave him enough momentum to carry the majority of the rest of the states.\n\n===Election issues===\nAccording to exit polls taking during the [[Iowa Democratic caucuses, 2008|Iowa Caucuses]], the top 4 issues were ranked as follows:<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/primaries/pages/epolls/IA/index.html| title = CNN.com 2004 Primaries | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\n# Economy/Jobs (29% of Respondents)\n# Health Care/Medicine (28% of Respondents)\n# The war in Iraq (14% of Respondents)\n# Education (14% of Respondents)\n\n====Economy====\nDespite being characterized by many as an election on [[Iraq]], the economy and jobs were repeatedly cited as voters' top or one of top three concerns during the course of the primary season. In [[Iowa]], of those who cited the [[economy]] as their most important issue, 34% supported Kerry, while 33% supported Edwards, with Dean trailing at 16% and Gephardt at 12%.\n\nEventual nominee [[John Kerry]], much like other Democrats adopted policy stances of tax-cuts for the middle class, increased spending for Social Security, and assisting small businesses.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/special/president/issues/index.kerry.html| title = CNN.com Specials | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref> On the aspect of job creation, Kerry strongly supported the creation and safety of infrastructure-related jobs, like those in the railroad industry. During the course of the primary Kerry continued to advocate positions such as fiscal responsibility and end state fiscal crises by giving states increased fiscal aid.\n\nRunner up [[John Edwards]] ran a position of support for the [[middle class]] as well as [[budget]] caps and enforcement.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/special/president/issues/index.edwards.html| title = CNN.com Specials | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref> Strongly opposing Social Security privatization, and interested in middle class tax cuts, Edwards's main economic theme was support for the middle class touting his own struggle, growing up the son of a poor mill worker in [[South Carolina]]. Another major component of Edwards's message was to be able to reinstate fiscal responsibility.\n\n[[Howard Dean]], despite taking many of the same positions of his rivals including Edwards and Kerry, had a starkly different approach on the issue of Social Security and tax cuts.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/special/president/issues/index.dean.html| title = CNN.com Specials | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref> On taxes, Dean favored repealing the [[Bush Tax cuts]] not only for the wealthiest of Americans as Senator Edwards and Senator Kerry proposed, but for all, including middle and lower classes.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/12/us/tax-cuts-split-the-democratic-presidential-field.html |title=Tax Cuts Split the Democratic Presidential Field |last=Rosenbaum |first=David E. |date=2003-09-12 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2017-12-09 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n==== Iraq War ====\nAfter the 9/11 attacks, the Bush administration argued that the need to remove [[Saddam Hussein]] from power in [[Iraq]] had now become urgent. Over the course of several months, Bush presented several premises for war, but the turning point was that Saddam's regime had tried to acquire [[nuclear material]] and had not properly accounted for [[biological weapons|biological]] and [[chemical weapons|chemical]] material it was known to have possessed, potential [[weapons of mass destruction]] (WMD) in violation of [[Iraq sanctions|U.N. sanctions]].  This\nsituation escalated to the point that the United States assembled a group of about forty nations, including the [[United Kingdom]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]], and [[Poland]], which Bush called the \"[[coalition of the willing]]\", to invade Iraq.\n\nThe coalition invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003.  Most contenders for the nomination were supportive of the effort.  Only Dean and Kucinich firmly questioned the aims and tactics of the administration, setting themselves apart in the eyes of war protesters.  However, speaking before an audience in [[Peterborough, New Hampshire]], John Kerry said, \"We need a regime change not just in Iraq. We need a regime change here in the United States.\"<ref>{{cite news | last=Poor | first=Eric | title=Kerry calls for new U.S. leadership |date=2003-04-03 | publisher=Monadnock Ledger | url=http://www.mledger.com/2003/archives/1_news_040303.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040917004530/http://www.mledger.com/2003/archives/1_news_040303.shtml | archivedate=2004-09-17}}</ref>  Republicans criticized Kerry for speaking out against a wartime president.<ref>{{cite news | last=Pickler | first=Nedra | title=POLITICAL NOTEBOOK: Hastert, Delay assail Kerry speech; Edwards chats with Bush; Dean writing a book | date=2003-04-03 | agency=Associated Press | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/news/archive/2003/04/03/national1601EST0726.DTL | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030624183241/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fnews%2Farchive%2F2003%2F04%2F03%2Fnational1601EST0726.DTL | archivedate=2003-06-24 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe invasion was swift, with the collapse of the Iraq government and the [[military of Iraq]] in about three weeks. The oil infrastructure of Iraq was rapidly secured with limited damage in that time. On May 1, [[George W. Bush]] landed on the aircraft carrier [[USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72)|USS ''Abraham Lincoln'']] in a [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed]] [[S-3 Viking]], where he gave a speech announcing the end of major combat in the Iraq war. Clearly visible in the background was a banner stating \"Mission Accomplished\". Bush's landing was criticized by opponents as being overly theatrical and expensive. The banner, made by [[White House]] personnel (according to a [[CNN]] story:<ref>{{cite news | last=Bash | first=Dana  | title=White House pressed on 'mission accomplished' sign |date=2003-10-29 | publisher=CNN | url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/10/28/mission.accomplished/}}\n</ref>) and placed there by the U.S. Navy, was criticized as premature. Nonetheless, Bush's approval rating in the month of May rode at 66%, according to a CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll.<ref>{{cite news | title=Bush Jumpstarts '04 Fundraising |date=2003-05-24 | agency=Associated Press | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/05/24/politics/main555427.shtml | work=CBS News}}</ref>\n\nOn May 3, 2003, Democrats met at the [[University of South Carolina Columbia|University of South Carolina]] in the first formal debate between the nine challengers for the nomination. The candidates disagreed on the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|war against Iraq]], health insurance, and even President Bush's tax cuts, but united in criticizing Bush's handling of the economy.\n\n=== Dean emerges as front-runner ===\n{{main|John Kerry 2004 presidential campaign| John Edwards 2004 presidential campaign| Howard Dean 2004 presidential campaign| Wesley Clark 2004 presidential campaign}}\n[[Image:Howard Dean declaration of candidacy June 2003.jpg|thumb|300px|Howard Dean declared his candidacy on June 23, 2003, winning the MoveOn \"primary\" days later. His campaign would go on to lead most polls and raise the most money in the latter part of 2003.]]\n\nOn May 31, 2002, [[Vermont]] Governor [[Howard Dean]] formed a presidential exploratory committee.  Though this was almost two years before the Iowa Caucus, Dean hoped the early start would give him some much needed name recognition.  As a governor of a small state, Dean was not well known outside of New England.\n\nIn December of that year, [[John Kerry|John F. Kerry]], [[United States Senate|U.S. senator]] from [[Massachusetts]], announced on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Meet the Press]]'' his plans to form an exploratory committee for a possible 2004 presidential run, anticipating a formal announcement \"down the road some months\".  Kerry's experience as a decorated [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] veteran generated some excitement among Democrats tired of being on the defensive about their candidates' suitability in the role of \"commander in chief\".\n\nTwo weeks later, former [[Vice President of the United States of America|Vice President]] and [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential candidate]] [[Al Gore]] announced on the [[CBS]] program ''[[60 Minutes]]'' that he would not seek election to the presidency in 2004. Gore had recently wrapped up a nationwide book tour and had been widely expected to run.\n\nOther potential candidates were likely waiting to see what Gore's plans were, and thus the floodgates opened in January 2003. Senator [[Joe Lieberman|Joseph Lieberman]], Gore's 2000 vice presidential running mate,  had previously promised not to run should Gore seek their party's nomination. Freed from that obligation, Lieberman announced his intention to run.  Additionally, many other candidates announced their intention to form committees (a formality usually indicating an official run): U.S. Sen. [[John Edwards|John R. Edwards]] of [[North Carolina]], U.S. Rep. [[Dick Gephardt|Richard A. \"Dick\" Gephardt]] of [[Missouri]], and Reverend [[Al Sharpton]] of [[New York (state)|New York]].  In February, more candidates announced their intentions: former Senator from [[Illinois]] [[Carol Moseley Braun]], U.S. Representative from [[Ohio]] [[Dennis Kucinich]], and [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Bob Graham]] of [[Florida]].\n\nThere were other potential candidates for whom some speculation was buzzing about a potential run. These candidates felt it necessary to officially state that they would not seek the party nomination. These included [[United States Senate]] Minority Leader [[Tom Daschle]], U.S. Senator [[Christopher Dodd]] of [[Connecticut]], and former U.S. Senator [[Gary Hart]] from [[Colorado]].\n\nIn April, Democratic fund-raising totals for the first quarter of 2003 were reported. John Edwards raised $7.4 million, John Kerry raised $7.0 million, Dick Gephardt raised $3.5 million, Joe Lieberman raised $3.0 million, Howard Dean raised $2.6 million, Bob Graham raised $1.1 million, and Dennis Kucinich and Carol Moseley Braun raised less than $1 million each.\n\nIn June 2003, [[Howard Dean]] aired the first [[television]] advertising of the 2004 campaign, spending more than $300,000.  During that time, he formally announced his run for president, filing to form a presidential election campaign with the FEC.  Later that month, liberal advocacy website [[MoveOn]] held the first ever online Democratic \"primary\", which lasted just over 48 hours. It was an unofficial and nonbinding affair, but with important symbolic and financial value.  Of 317,647 votes, [[Howard Dean]] received 44%, [[Dennis Kucinich]] 24%, and [[John Kerry]] 16%.  Had any candidate received 50% of the vote, the candidate would have received MoveOn's endorsement and financial support.  Instead, MoveOn supported all the candidates.<ref>{{cite web | title=Report on the 2003 MoveOn.org Political Action Primary | work=MoveOn.org | url=http://moveon.org/pac/primary/report.html | accessdate=September 28, 2005 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050929062844/http://moveon.org/pac/primary/report.html | archivedate=September 29, 2005 }}</ref>\n\nIn July, the Democratic fund-raising numbers for the second quarter of 2003 were reported and announced.  Howard Dean surprised many raising $7.5 million, John Kerry raised $6 million, while John Edwards and Joseph Lieberman raised roughly $5 million each.  Dean's strength as a fund-raiser was attributed mainly to his innovative embrace of the Internet for campaigning.  The majority of his donations came from individual Dean supporters, who came to be known as ''Deanites'', or, more commonly, ''[[Deaniac]]s''.  His campaign's innovative use of the [[Internet]] helped to build a strongly supportive [[grassroots]] constituency, much of which remained intensely loyal to him long after the end of his candidacy.\n\nBy autumn of 2003, Dean had become the apparent front-runner for the Democratic nomination, performing strongly in most polls.  Generally regarded as a pragmatic [[centrist]] during his time as governor, Dean emerged during his presidential campaign as something of a [[populism|populist]], denouncing the policies of the Bush administration (especially the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]) as well as fellow Democrats, who, in his view, failed to strongly oppose them.\n\nDuring his presidential campaign, critics on the right labeled Dean's political views as those of an extreme [[Liberalism|liberal]]; however, in liberal [[Vermont]], Dean, long known as a staunch advocate of fiscal restraint, was regarded as a moderate. Many critics on the left, who supported fellow Democrat [[Dennis Kucinich]] or independent [[Ralph Nader]], charged that, at heart, Dean was a \"[[Rockefeller Republican]]\"&mdash;socially liberal, while fiscally conservative.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jan/17/politics |title=Howard Dean: 'the flip flop candidate' |last=Raban |first=Jonathan |date=2004-01-17 |work=The Guardian |access-date=2017-12-09 |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n=== Wesley Clark enters ===\nOver the summer of 2003, several organized groups began a [[United States|nationwide]] campaign to \"[[Political draft|draft]]\" retired [[general|four-star general]] [[Wesley Clark]] for the Democratic Party's nomination for the 2004 presidential election. CNN on August 13 showed a [[Television commercial|commercial]] by one of these groups and interviewed Clark. He disavowed any connection with the \"draft Clark\" groups, but said he had been considering his position and that within a few weeks he would likely make public his decision on whether to\nrun. He also fueled speculation with a television interview in which he first declared himself a Democrat.\n\nOn September 17, 2003, in Little Rock, Arkansas, Clark announced his intention to run in the [[U.S. Democratic Party Presidential Primary, 2004|presidential primary election]] for the Democratic Party nomination, becoming the tenth and last Democrat to do so (coming many months after the others): \"My name is Wes Clark.  I am from Little Rock, Arkansas, and I am here to announce that I intend to seek the presidency of the United States of America.\"  He said, \"We're going to run a campaign that will move this country forward, not back.\"\n\nHis campaign focused on themes of leadership and patriotism; early campaign ads relied heavily on biography. His late start left him with relatively few detailed policy proposals. This weakness was apparent in his first few debates, although he soon presented a range of position papers, including a major tax-relief plan. Nevertheless, many Democrats flocked to his campaign.  They were drawn by his military background, and saw such foreign policy credentials as a valuable asset in challenging [[George W. Bush]] post-[[September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attacks|September 11]]. Advisors and supporters portrayed him as more electable than [[Howard Dean]], who was still the front-runner for the party's nomination.  Despite the burst of enthusiasm for Clark in late 2003, Dean maintained a strong lead in the polls for the latter half of the year.  Clark won the Democratic Presidential Primary in [[Oklahoma]], the only state carried by Clark in the primary election.\n\nCriticism of Clark began almost the moment he entered the race. Originally heralded as an antiwar general, he stumbled in the first few days of his candidacy. He was perceived as changing his answer on how he would have voted on the Iraq war resolution.  His supporters argued that his perceived indecision was due to lack of experience with the media and their insistence on short \"sound bite\" answers.\n\n=== Iowa and New Hampshire ===\nThroughout the early campaigning season, the [[Iowa Democratic caucuses, 2004|Iowa caucuses]] appeared to be a two-way contest between former [[Vermont]] Governor [[Howard Dean]] and [[Missouri]] Congressman [[Richard Gephardt]]. Dean, the national front runner, had been able to pour money into [[Iowa]] and [[New Hampshire]]. In total, Dean spent nearly $40 million in the two states.<ref>{{Cite news| url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E1DF1038F93AA15752C0A9629C8B63| title =  THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE FORMER GOVERNOR; IN SHAKE-UP, DEAN NAMES GORE ALLY TO RUN CAMPAIGN | work=The New York Times | first1=Jodi| last1=Wilgoren| first2=Glen| last2=Justice| date=January 29, 2004}}</ref> Gephardt, coming from neighboring Missouri, won the state's caucus in 1988 when he first ran for the party nomination.\n\nHowever, days before the Iowa caucuses were held, negative campaigning by Dean and Gephardt took a late toll on the two campaigns in Iowa as well as nationally. This, along with the resurgence of John Kerry and the emergence of John Edwards as major contenders in Iowa, put the Gephardt and Dean campaigns on edge.\n\nA poll released by the ''[[Des Moines Register]]'' days before the caucus was held showed Dean and Gephardt had lost all of their lead in Iowa. In the poll, Kerry led with 26% of those surveyed, Edwards came in second with 23%, Dean came in third with 20%, and Gephardt came in fourth with 18%.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/primaries/pages/misc/iowa.recap.html| title = CNN.com 2004 Primaries | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn caucus night, as results were being tallied, it became evident that Kerry and Edwards were in a battle for first and Dean and Gephardt were in a battle for third.\n[[File:Iowa Democratic presidential caucuses, 2004.svg|thumb|Iowa results by county{{legend|#2A7FFF|John Kerry}}{{legend|#ff7f2a|John Edwards}}{{legend|#00ff66|Howard Dean}}{{legend|#666666|Tie}}\n]]\n<nowiki> </nowiki>After all votes were tallied, John Kerry received 38% of the delegates, John Edwards received 32%, Howard Dean received 18%, and Richard Gephardt received 11%.\n\nAfter his poor showing, Gephardt dropped out of the race.<ref>{{ cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/01/19/elec04.prez.gephardt/index.html| title = Gephardt to drop out of race | work=CNN | date=January 18, 2004 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref> Kerry and Edwards claimed newfound momentum, while Dean attempted to downplay the results.\n\nIn the [[2004 New Hampshire Democratic primary|New Hampshire primary]], Kerry was able to defeat Howard Dean once again, beating him 38%-26%.

He finished with 12% in the [[New Hampshire primary]] one week later, essentially tied for third-place position with retired general [[Wesley Clark]]. The following week, Edwards won in [[South Carolina]] and nearly beat Clark in [[Oklahoma]].\n\n[[Image:John-Edwards-Shakes-Hands.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Edwards on the campaign trail in 2004.]]\nAfter Dean's withdrawal from the contest, Edwards became the only major challenger to Kerry for the nomination. However, Kerry continued to dominate, taking in wins in [[Michigan]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Maine]], [[Tennessee]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Nevada]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Utah]], [[Hawaii]], and [[Idaho]]. Remarking on an unexpectedly strong finish in [[Wisconsin]] on February 17, Edwards humorously cautioned Kerry: \"Objects in your mirror may be closer than they appear.\" Many other candidates dropped out during this time, leaving only Kerry, Edwards, Sharpton and Kucinich in the running. Dean, while not officially running, did not release his delegates, and still put in a strong showing considering that he was no longer mounting an official campaign.\n\nEdwards maintained a positive campaign and largely avoided attacking Kerry until a February 29, 2004, debate in [[New York City]], where he attempted to put Kerry on the defensive by characterizing the front-runner as a \"Washington insider\" and by mocking Kerry's plan to form a committee to examine trade agreements.\n\nIn [[Super Tuesday]], March 2, Kerry won decisive victories in the [[California]], [[Connecticut]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Maryland]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Ohio]], and [[Rhode Island]] primaries and the [[Minnesota]] caucuses. Dean, despite having withdrawn from the race two weeks earlier, won his home state of Vermont. Edwards finished only slightly behind Kerry in Georgia but, failing to win a single state, chose to withdraw, making Kerry the [[presumptive nominee]]. President [[George W. Bush|Bush]] called Senator Kerry to congratulate him that evening.\n\nOn March 11, after meetings with Democratic [[superdelegate]]s in [[Washington, D.C.]], and former [[primary election]] opponents, Kerry accumulated the 2,162 delegates required to clinch the nomination. The [[Democratic National Committee|DNC's]] website acknowledged him as the party's nominee at that time, four and a half months prior to the [[2004 Democratic National Convention|Convention]].\n\n''See also the [[John Kerry 2004 presidential campaign]]''\n\n=== Nomination ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:KerryatDNC.jpg|thumb|238px|Kerry gave a salute and proclaimed, \"I'm John Kerry and I'm reporting for duty.\"|{{deletable image-caption|1=Tuesday, 19 August 2008}}]] -->\n{{details|2004 Democratic National Convention}}\n\nOn July 6, John Kerry selected John Edwards as his running mate shortly before the 2004 Democratic National Convention in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], held later that month.  Senators Kerry and Edwards were formally nominated by the Democratic Party at the convention.  The Kerry/Edwards ticket was on the ballot in all 50 states, plus the District of Columbia.  In [[New York (state)|New York]], the ticket was also on the ballot as candidates of the [[Working Families Party]].\n\n[[Governor of New Mexico|New Mexico Governor]] [[Bill Richardson (politician)|Bill Richardson]] served as chairman of the convention while former presidential advisor to [[Bill Clinton]], [[Lottie Shackelford]],  served as vice chairman.  Defining moments of the 2004 Democratic National Convention included the featured [[keynote speech]] of [[Barack Obama]], a [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]] native and candidate for the [[United States Senate]] from [[Illinois]], [[Bill Clinton]]'s opening night speech and the confirmation of the [[Democratic Party presidential nomination, 2004|nomination]] of [[John Kerry]] as the candidate for president and of [[John Edwards]] as the candidate for [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]].  Kerry made his [[Vietnam War]] experience a prominent theme.  In accepting the nomination, he began his speech with \"I'm John Kerry and I'm reporting for duty.\"\n\nKerry and Edwards faced incumbents [[George W. Bush]] and [[Dick Cheney]] of the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] in the [[2004 U.S. presidential election|2004 presidential election]].  Following his official nomination at the Convention, Kerry received only a small [[convention bounce|bounce]] in the polls and remained \"neck and neck\" with Bush.  This was the first time in recent political history that a candidate failed to receive a substantial boost in post-convention poll numbers. Some political pundits attributed this small boost to the unusually small number of undecided voters as compared with previous presidential elections.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Inskeep |first1=Steve |title=Polls: Kerry Got Little Bounce from Boston |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=3809479 |website=NPR |accessdate=28 January 2019 |language=en |date=2 August 2004}}</ref>\n\nThe general election was won by Bush, who defeated Kerry.  The election was fought primarily on the issue of the conduct of the [[War on Terrorism|War on Terror]].  Bush defended the actions of his administration, while Kerry contended that the war had been fought incompetently, and that the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq War]] was a distraction from the War on Terror, not a part of it.\n\n== Overview ==\n{| style=\"margin:auto\"\n|{{#tag:timeline|ImageSize=width:800 height:auto barincrement:20\nPlotArea = top:10 bottom:25 right:10 left:10\nAlignBars =

During the [[Partitions of Poland]] from 1772 to 1795, minor szlachta began to lose these legal privileges and social status, while elites became part of the nobility of partitioning countries.\n\nAlthough szlachta members had greatly unequal status due to wealth and political influence, few official distinctions existed between elites and common nobility. Because of the juridic principle of szlachta equality, and a disdain for distinction by way of titles, the relatively few hereditary [[Noble title|titles]] in the Kingdom of Poland were bestowed by foreign monarchs, including personal hereditary titles granted by the [[Papal nobility|Pope]] &mdash; see [[Feliks Soba\u0144ski]]. In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Ruthenia, and Samogitia princely titles were mostly inherited by descendants of Old Lithuanian-Ruthenian [[Rurik dynasty|Rurikid]] and [[Family of Gediminas|Gediminids]] princely families, or by princely dynasties of Tatar origin settled there.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe Polish term ''szlachta'' is derived from the [[Old High German]] word ''slahta''. In modern German ''Geschlecht'' - which originally came from the [[Proto-Germanic]] *''slagiz'', \"blow\", \"strike\", and shares the [[Anglo-Saxon]] root for \"slaughter\" or the verb \"to slug\" \u2013 means \"breeding\" or gender. Like many other Polish words pertaining to nobility, it derives from Germanic words: the Polish for a \"knight\" is \"''rycerz''\", a [[cognate]] of the German \"''Ritter''\".

The Polish tribes were internalized and organized around a unifying religious cult, governed by the ''[[Veche|wiec]]'', an assembly of free tribesmen. Later, when safety required power to be consolidated, an elected prince was chosen to govern. The election privilege was usually limited to elites.<ref name=\"bardach202627\" />\n\nThe tribes were ruled by clans ([[:pl:R\u00f3d|''r\u00f3d'']]) consisting of people related by blood or marriage and theoretically descending from a common ancestor,<ref name=\"radwan-family-line\" /> giving the r\u00f3d/clan a highly developed sense of solidarity. (See ''[[gens]]''.) The ''[[starosta]]'' (or ''starszyna'') had judicial and military power over the r\u00f3d/clan, although this power was often exercised with an assembly of elders. Strongholds called ''[[Gord (Slavic settlement)|gr\u03ccd]]'' were built where the religious cult was powerful, where trials were conducted, and where clans gathered in the face of danger. The ''opole'' was the territory occupied by a single tribe. {{Harv|Manteuffel|1982|p=44}} The family unit of a tribe is called the ''rodzina'', while a collection of tribes is a [[:pl:Plemi\u0119|''plemi\u0119'']].\n\n[[Mieszko I of Poland]] (c. 935 \u2013 25 May 992) established an elite knightly retinue from within his army, which he depended upon for success in uniting the [[Lechites|Lekhitic]] tribes and preserving the unity of his state. Documented proof exists of Mieszko I's successors utilizing such a retinue, as well.\n\nAnother class of knights were granted land by the prince, allowing them the economic ability to serve the prince militarily. A Polish nobleman living at the time prior to the 15th century was referred to as a \"rycerz\", very roughly equivalent to the English \"knight,\" the critical difference being the status of \"rycerz\" was almost strictly hereditary;<ref name=\"szacki--inherited--1995\" /><ref name=\"topor-jakubowski--1998\" /> the class of all such individuals was known as the \"rycerstwo\".<ref name=\"topor-jakubowski--1998\" /> Representing the wealthier families of Poland and itinerant knights from abroad seeking their fortunes, this other class of rycerstwo, which became the szlachta/nobility (\"szlachta\" becomes the proper term for Polish nobility beginning about the 15th century), gradually formed apart from Mieszko I's and his successors' elite retinues. This rycerstwo/nobility obtained more privileges granting them favored status. They were absolved from particular burdens and obligations under ducal law, resulting in the belief only rycerstwo (those combining military prowess with high/noble birth) could serve as officials in state administration.\n\nSelect rycerstwo were distinguished above the other rycerstwo, because they descended from past tribal dynasties, or because early [[Piast dynasty|Piasts']] endowments made them select beneficiaries. These rycerstwo of great wealth were called mo\u017cni (Magnates). Socially they were not a distinct class from the rycerstwo from which they all originated<ref name=\"dmowski-magnates-szlachta\">{{cite book\n | last = Dmowski\n | first = Roman Stanis\u0142aw\n | authorlink = Roman Dmowski\n | editor-last = Duff\n | editor-first = James Duff\n | editor-link = James Duff Duff\n | chapter-url = https://archive.org/details/RussianRealitiesAndProblems\n | title = RUSSIAN REALITIES & PROBLEMS\n | year = 1917\n | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]\n | location = Cambridge, East of England, ENGLAND, UNITED KINGDOM\n | page = 94\n | chapter = Poland, Old And New\n | quote = But between the gentry and the magnates there was only a difference of wealth and culture.

The prior social structure was one of Polish tribes united into the historic Polish nation under a state ruled by the [[Piast dynasty]], this dynasty appearing circa 850 A.D.\n\nSome mo\u017cni (Magnates) descending from past tribal dynasties regarded themselves as co-proprietors of Piast realms, even though the Piasts attempted to deprive them of their independence. These mo\u017cni (Magnates) constantly sought to undermine princely authority.<ref name=\"davies--norman\" />{{rp|75, 76}} In [[Gallus Anonymus|Gall Anonym's]] chronicle, there is noted the nobility's alarm when the [[Count palatine|Palatine]] [[Sieciech]] \"elevated those of a lower class over those who were noble born\" entrusting them with state offices. {{Harv|Manteuffel|1982|p=149}}\n\n==== Lithuania ====\n{{Main|Lithuanian nobility}}\n[[File:Jogaila (W\u0142adys\u0142aw II).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jogaila (W\u0142adys\u0142aw II)]]]]\nIn [[Lithuania Propria]] and in [[Samogitia]], prior to the creation of the [[Kingdom of Lithuania]] by [[Mindaugas]], nobles were called ''die beste leuten'' in [[German language|German]] sources. In Lithuanian, nobles were named ''ponai''. The higher nobility were named ''kunigai'' or ''kunigaik\u0161\u010diai'' (dukes) \u2014 a loanword from Scandinavian ''[[konung]]''. They were the established local leaders and warlords. During the development of the state, they gradually became subordinated to higher dukes, and later to the [[King of Lithuania]]. Because of Lithuanian expansion into the lands of [[Ruthenia]] in the middle of the 14th century, a new term for nobility appeared \u2014 ''bajorai'', from [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] ''\u0431\u043e\u044f\u0440\u0435''. This word is used to this day in Lithuania to refer to nobility in general, including those from abroad.\n\nAfter the [[Union of Horod\u0142o]], the Lithuanian nobility acquired equal status with its Polish counterparts. Over time they became increasingly [[polonized]], although they did preserve their [[nation]]al consciousness, and in most cases recognition of their Lithuanian family roots. In the 16th century, some of the Lithuanian nobility claimed that they were descended from the Romans, and that the [[Lithuanian language]] was derived from Latin. This led to a conundrum: Polish nobility claimed its own ancestry from [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] tribes, but Sarmatians were considered enemies of the Romans. Thus, a new Roman-Sarmatian theory was created. Strong cultural ties with Polish nobility led to a new term for Lithuanian nobility appearing in the 16th century \u2014 ''\u0161l\u0117kta'', a direct loanword from Polish ''szlachta''. Recently, Lithuanian linguists advocated dropping the usage of this Polish loanword.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kiaupien\u0117 |first=J\u016brat\u0117 |author-link=J\u016brat\u0117 Kiaupien\u0117 |year=2003 |title=\"Mes, Lietuva\": Lietuvos Did\u017eiosios Kunigaik\u0161tyst\u0117s bajorija XVI a. |trans-title=\"We the Lithuania\": nobility of Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 16th c. |language=Lithuanian |publisher=Kronta |isbn=9955-595-08-6 |page=64}}</ref>\n\nThe process of [[polonization]] took place over a lengthy period. At first only the leading members of the nobility were involved. Gradually the wider population became affected. Major effects on the lesser Lithuanian nobility occurred after various sanctions were imposed by the [[Russian Empire]], such as removing ''Lithuania'' from the names of the ''Gubernyas'' shortly after the [[November Uprising]].<ref name=\"Ochma\u0144ski\">{{cite book |last=Ochma\u0144ski |first=Jerzy |title=The National Idea in Lithuania from the 16th to the First Half of the 19th Century: The Problem of Cultural-Linguistic Differentiation |publisher=Mickiewicz University |year=1986 |location=Pozna\u0144}}</ref> After the [[January Uprising]] the sanctions went further, and Russian officials announced that \"Lithuanians were actually Russians seduced by Poles and Catholicism\" and began to intensify [[Lithuanian press ban#Origins and legal basis|russification]], and to [[Lithuanian press ban|ban]] the printing of books in Lithuanian.\n\n==== Ruthenia ====\n{{Main|Ruthenian nobility}}\nAfter the principalities of [[Halych]] and [[Volhynia]] became integrated with the Grand Duchy, [[Ruthenia]]'s nobility gradually rendered loyalty to the multilingual and cultural [[melting pot]] that was the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. Many noble Ruthenian families intermarried with Lithuanians.\n\nThe rights of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] nobles were nominally equal to those enjoyed by the Polish and Lithuanian nobility, but they were put under cultural pressure to convert to Catholicism. It was a policy that was greatly eased in 1596 by the [[Union of Brest]].

Initially, this privilege could be granted by the monarch, but from 1641 onward, this right was reserved for the [[sejm]]. Most often the individual being ennobled would join an existing noble szlachta clan and assume the undifferentiated [[Polish heraldry|coat of arms]] of that clan.\n\nAccording to [[heraldic]] sources, the total number of legal ennoblements issued between the 14th century and the mid-18th century is estimated at approximately 800.<ref name=\"czajkowski\" /><ref name=\"pudlowski\" /> This is an average of only about two ennoblements per year, or only 0.000,000,14 \u2013 0.000,001 of the historical population.

This can most readily be explained in terms of the ongoing decline and eventual collapse of the Commonwealth and the resulting need for soldiers and other military leaders (see: [[Partitions of Poland]], King [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]]).\n\n==== Estimated number of ennoblements ====\n[[File:Stanis\u0142aw Szcz\u0119sny Potocki.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''Count [[Stanis\u0142aw Szcz\u0119sny Potocki]] with children'', by [[Johann Baptist von Lampi the Elder]].]]\nAccording to [[heraldic]]<ref name=\"czajkowski\" /><ref name=\"pudlowski\" /> sources 1,600 is the total estimated number of all legal ennoblements throughout the history of Kingdom of Poland and Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth from the 14th century onward (half of which were performed in the final years of the late 18th century).\n\nTypes of ennoblement:\n* [[Adopcja herbowa]] \u2013 The \"old way\" of ennoblement, popular in the 15th century, connected with adoption into an existing noble clan by a powerful lord, but abolished in the 17th century.\n* [[Skartabellat]] \u2013 Introduced by [[Pacta conventa (Poland)|pacta conventa]] of the 17th century, this was ennoblement into a sort of \"conditional\" or \"graduated nobility\" status. Skartabels could not hold public offices or be members of the Sejm, but after three generations, the descendants of these families would \"mature\" to full szlachta status.\n* [[Indygenat]] \u2013 from the Latin expression, ''indigenatus'', recognition of foreign noble status. A foreign noble, after acquiring indygenat status, received all privileges of a Polish szlachcic. In Polish history, 413 foreign noble families were recognized. Prior to the 17th century this was done by the King and [[Sejm]], after the 17th century it was done only by the Sejm.\n* \"secret ennoblement\" \u2013 This was of questionable legal status and was often not recognized by many szlachta members. It was typically granted by the elected monarch without the required legal approval of the Sejm.\n\n=== In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania ===\nIn the late 14th century, in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], [[Vytautas the Great]] reformed the Grand Duchy's army: instead of calling all men to arms, he created forces comprising professional warriors\u2014''[[bajorai]]'' (\"nobles\"; see the [[cognate]] \"''[[boyar]]''\"). As there were not enough nobles, Vytautas trained suitable men, relieving them of labor on the land and of other duties; for their [[military service]] to the Grand Duke, they were granted land that was worked by hired men ([[veldamas|veldam]]s). The newly formed noble families generally took up, as their [[family name]]s, the [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] pagan [[given name]]s of their ennobled ancestors; this was the case with the [[Go\u0161tautai]], [[Radvilos]], [[Astikai]], [[K\u0119sgailos]] and others. These families were granted their [[coats of arms]] under the [[Union of Horodlo]] (1413).\n\nIn 1506, King [[Sigismund I the Old]] confirmed the position of the [[Lithuanian Council of Lords]] in state politics and limited entry into the [[nobility]].\n\n== Privileges ==\n{{main|Szlachta's privileges}}\n\nSpecific rights of the szlachta included:\n[[File:Bellotto Election of Stanislas Augustus.jpg|thumb|Election of [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]] in 1764]]\n# The right to hold outright ownership of land ([[Allod]]) -- not as a fief, conditional upon service to the liege Lord, but absolutely in perpetuity unless sold.

Many nobles were, in fact, usurpers who were commoners that had moved to another part of the country and falsely claimed noble status.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} Hundreds of such \"false nobles\" were denounced by Hieronim Nekanda Trepka in his ''\"Liber generationis plebeanorum\"'', or ''\"Liber chamorum\"'', in the first half of the 16th century. The law forbade non-nobles to own ''folwarks'' and promised such estates as a reward to denouncers. Trepka was himself an impoverished nobleman who lived a town dweller's life and documented hundreds of such false claims hoping to take over one of the usurped estates. He does not seem to have succeeded in his quest despite his employment as the king's secretary.<ref>Leszczy\u0144ski, R.

It is unknown what percentage of the Polish nobility came from the 'lower orders' of society, but most historians agree nobles of such base origins formed a 'significant' element of the szlachta. {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nSelf-promotion and aggrandizement were not confined to commoners. Often, members of the lower szlachta sought further ennoblement from foreign, therefore less verifiable, sources. That is, they might acquire by legitimate means or otherwise, such as by purchase, one of a selection of foreign titles ranging from [[Baron]], [[Marchese]], [[Freiherr]] to [[Count|Comte]], all readily translatable into the Polish ''[[Hrabia]]''. Alternatively, they would simply appropriate a title by conferring it upon themselves. An example of this is cited in the case of the last descendant of the [[Andrzej Ciechanowiecki|Ciechanowiecki family]], who managed to restore a genuinely old [[Comital]] title, but whose actual origins are shrouded in 18th-century mystery.<ref>{{cite journal|author= Andrzej Rachuba, \"Panowie z Ciechanowa\"|title= Kronika Zamkowa 1-2/59-60|page=33|date = 2010|url=http://mazowsze.hist.pl/16/Kronika_Zamkowa/356/2010/12307/ }} In Polish with an English summary.

[retrieved 2018.11.30.]</ref>\n\n=== Accretion of sovereignty to the szlachta ===\nPolish nobility enjoyed many rights that were not available to their equivalents in other countries. Over time, each new monarch ceded to them further privileges. Those privileges became the basis of the ''[[Golden Liberty]]'' in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. Despite having a king, Poland was considered the 'nobility's [[Rzeczpospolita|Commonwealth]]' because [[Royal elections in Poland]] were in the hands of members of a hereditary class. Poland was therefore the domain of this class, and not that of the king or the ruling [[dynasty]]. This arose in part because of the extinction of male heirs in the original royal dynasties: first, the [[Piasts]], then the [[Jagiellons]]. As a result, the nobility took it upon itself to choose \"the Polish king\" from among the dynasties' [[Matrilineality|matrilinial]] descendants.\n\nPoland's successive kings granted privileges to the nobility upon their election to the throne - the privileges having been specified in the king-elect's [[Pacta conventa (Poland)|Pacta conventa]] - and at other times, in exchange for ''[[ad hoc]]'' leave to raise an extraordinary tax or a ''[[pospolite ruszenie]]'', a military call up. Poland's nobility thus accumulated a growing array of privileges and immunities.\n\nIn 1355 in [[Buda]] King [[Casimir III of Poland|Casimir III the Great]]<!--or Louis the Hungarian? sources vary! needs verification!--> issued the first country-wide privilege for the nobility, in exchange for their agreeing that if Casimir had no male heirs, the throne would pass to his nephew, [[Louis I of Hungary]]. Casimir further decreed that the nobility would no longer be subject to 'extraordinary' taxes or have to use their own funds for foreign military expeditions. Casimir also promised that when the royal court toured, the king and the court would cover all expenses, instead of requiring facilities to be provided by the local nobility.\n\n==== The Privilege of Koszyce and others ====\nIn 1374 [[Louis I of Hungary|King Louis of Hungary]] approved the [[Privilege of Koszyce]] (''przywilej koszycki'') to guarantee the Polish throne for his daughter, [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]]. He broadened the definition of membership of the nobility and exempted the entire class from all but one tax (''\u0142anowy'') a limit of 2 [[grosz]]es per ''\u0142an'' of land, [[Old Polish units of measurement]]. In addition, the King's right to raise taxes was effectively abolished: no new taxes would be levied without the agreement of the nobility. Henceforth, [[Offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth#District offices|district offices]] were also reserved exclusively for local nobility, as the Privilege of Koszyce forbade the king to grant official posts and major Polish castles to foreign knights. Finally, the privilege obliged the king to pay [[indemnity|indemnities]] to nobles injured or taken captive during a war outside Polish borders.\n\nIn 1422 [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o|King W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o]] was constrained by the Privilege of Czerwi\u0144sk (''przywilej czerwi\u0144ski''), which established the inviolability of nobles' property. Their estates could not be confiscated except upon the verdict of a court. It also made him cede some jurisdiction over [[fiscal policy]] to the [[Privy council|Royal Council]], later, the [[Senate of Poland]], including the right to [[mint (coin)|mint coinage]].\n\nIn 1430, with the Privileges of [[Jedlnia]], confirmed at [[Krak\u00f3w]] in 1433, Polish: ''przywileje jedlne\u0144sko-krakowskie'', based partially on his earlier [[Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski]] privilege (April 25, 1425), King W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o granted the nobility a guarantee against arbitrary arrest, similar to the English [[Magna Carta]]'s [[habeas corpus]], known from its own Latin name as \"[[neminem captivabimus]] nisi jure victum\". Henceforth, no member of the nobility could be imprisoned without a [[arrest warrant|warrant]] from a court of justice. The king could neither punish nor imprison any noble on a whim. King W\u0142adys\u0142aw's ''[[quid pro quo]]'' for the [[easement]] was the nobles' guarantee that the throne would be inherited by one of his sons, who would be bound to honour the privileges granted earlier to the nobility. On May 2, 1447 the same king issued the ''[[Wilno Pact]], or Wilno Privilege'', which gave the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuanian]] [[boyar]]s the same rights as those already secured by the Polish ''szlachta''.\n[[File:Rembrandt. A Polish Nobleman. 1637.PNG|right|thumb|upright|''[[A Polish Nobleman]]''. [[Rembrandt]], 1637]]\n\nIn 1454, [[Kazimierz IV Jagiellon|King Casimir IV]] granted the [[Nieszawa Statutes]] - Polish: ''statuty cerkwicko-nieszawskie'', clarifying the legal basis of [[voivodship]] [[sejmik]]s - local parliaments. The king could [[promulgation|promulgate]] new laws, raise taxes, or call for a mass military call up ''pospolite ruszenie'', only with the consent of the sejmiks, and the nobility were protected from judicial abuses. The Nieszawa Statutes also curbed the power of the magnates, as the Sejm, the national parliament, had the right to elect many officials, including judges, [[Voivode|voivods]] and [[castellan]]s. These privileges were demanded by the ''szlachta'' in exchange for their participation in the [[Thirteen Years' War (1454\u201366)|Thirteen Years' War]].\n\n==== First Royal Election ====\nThe first \"[[Royal elections in Poland|free election]]\" (Polish: ''wolna elekcja'') of a king took place in 1492. In fact, some earlier Polish kings had been elected with help from assemblies such as those that put [[Casimir II of Poland|Casimir II]] on the throne, thereby setting a precedent for free elections. Only [[senator]]s voted in the 1492 free election, which was won by [[John I Albert]]. For the duration of the [[Jagiellonian Dynasty]], only members of that royal family were considered for election. Later, there would be no restrictions on the choice of candidates.\n\nIn 1493 the Sejm, began meeting every two years at [[Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski|Piotrk\u00f3w]]. It comprised two chambers:\n* a [[Senat]]e of 81 [[bishop]]s and [[Offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth#Senatorial offices|other dignitaries]] \n* a Chamber of Deputies of 54 deputies representing their respective domains.\nThe numbers of senators and deputies later increased.\n\nOn April 26, 1496 King [[John I Albert]] granted the [[Privilege of Piotrk\u00f3w]]. The [[Statutes of Piotrk\u00f3w]] increased the nobility's [[feudal]] power over [[serfs]]. It bound the peasant to the land, and only one son though not the eldest, was permitted to leave the village. Townsfolk ''mieszcza\u0144stwo'' were prohibited from owning land. Positions in the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] hierarchy were restricted to nobles.\n\nOn 23 October 1501, the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian union]] was reformed by the [[Union of Mielnik]]. It was there that the tradition of a [[coronation Sejm]] was founded. Here again, the lesser nobility, lesser in wealth only - not in rank - attempted to reduce the power of the Magnates with a law that made them [[impeachment|impeachable]] before the Senate for [[malfeasance]]. However, the [[Act of Mielnik]] of 25 October did more to strengthen the Magnate-dominated [[Senate of Poland]] than the lesser nobility. Nobles as a whole were given the right to disobey the King or his representatives \u2014 ''non praestanda oboedientia'', and to form [[konfederacja|confederations]], armed opposition against the king or state officials if the nobles found that the law or their legitimate privileges were being infringed.\n[[File:Pot\u0119ga Rzeczypospolitej u zenitu. Z\u0142ota wolno\u015b\u0107. Elekcja R.P. 1573.jpg|thumb|right|''The Commonwealth's Power at Its Zenith, [[Golden Liberty]], the [[Royal elections in Poland|Election]] of 1573''. Painting by [[Jan Matejko]]]]\n\nOn 3 May 1505 King [[Alexander I Jagiellon]] granted the Act of ''[[Nihil novi]] nisi commune consensu'' - \"I accept nothing new except by common consent\". This forbade the king to pass new laws without the consent of the representatives of the nobility in the assembled Sejm, thus greatly strengthening the nobility's powers. Essentially, this act marked the transfer of legislative power from the king to the Sejm. It also marks the beginning of the [[First Rzeczpospolita]], the period of a ''szlachta''-run \"Commonwealth\".\n\nIn 1520 the Act of Bydgoszcz granted the Sejm the right to convene every four years, with or without the king's permission. At about that time the ''Executionist Movement'', seeking to oversee law enforcement, began to take shape. Its members sought to curb the power of the Magnates at the Sejm and to strengthen the power of the monarch. In 1562 at the Sejm in Piotrk\u00f3w they forced the Magnates to return many leased [[Krolewszczyzna|crown lands]] to the king, and the king to create a standing army [[wojsko kwarciane]]. One of the most famous members of this movement was [[Jan Zamoyski]].\n\n==== End of the Jagiellonian dynasty ====\n[[File:Anjou 1570louvre.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Henry III of France|Henry of Valois]], first elected monarch of Poland-Lithuania]]\nUntil the death of [[Sigismund II Augustus]], the last king of the [[Jagiellonian]] dynasty, all monarchs had to be elected from within the royal family. However, from 1573, practically any Polish noble or foreigner of royal blood could potentially become a [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish\u2013Lithuanian]] monarch. Every newly elected king was supposed to sign two documents: the ''[[Pacta conventa (Poland)|Pacta conventa]]'', the king's \"pre-election pact\", and the ''[[Henrican articles]]'', named after the first freely elected king, [[Henry III of France|Henry of Valois]]. The latter document was a virtual ''Polish constitution'' and contained the basic laws of the Commonwealth:\n* Free election of kings\n* [[Religious freedom in Poland|Religious tolerance]]\n* The Sejm to meet every two years\n* Foreign policy controlled by the Sejm\n* A royal advisory council chosen by the Sejm\n* Official posts restricted to Polish and Lithuanian nobles\n* Taxes and monopolies set up by the Sejm only\n* Nobles' right to disobey the Monarch should s/he break any of these laws.\n\nIn 1578 king, [[Stefan Batory]], created the [[Crown Tribunal]] to reduce the enormous pressure on the [[Court (royal)|Royal Court]]. This placed much of the monarch's juridical power in the hands of the elected szlachta deputies, further strengthening the nobility as a class. In 1581 the Crown Tribunal was joined by a counterpart in Lithuania, the [[Lithuanian Tribunal]].\n\n=== Transformation into aristocracy ===\n[[File:Posiadlosci magnaterii w XVI-XVII w.svg|thumb|right|[[Ownership|Possession]]s of major magnate families in 16th\u201317th century.]]\n{{main|Magnates of Poland and Lithuania}}\nFor many centuries, wealthy and powerful members of the szlachta sought to gain legal privileges over their peers. Few szlachta were wealthy enough to be known as Magnates, ''karmazyni'', the \"[[Crimson]]s\" - from the crimson colour of their boots. A true Magnate had to be able to trace his ancestry for many generations and own at least 20 villages or estates. He also had to hold high [[offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|office in the Commonwealth]].\n\n{{Citation needed|Some historians estimate the number of Magnates as 1% of the szlachta's total|date=November 2018}}. Thus, out of about one million szlachta, only 200\u2013300 persons could be classed as great Magnates with country-wide possessions and influence. Of these some 30\u201340 were considered as having significant impact on Poland's politics. Magnates often received gifts from monarchs, which greatly increased their wealth. Although such gifts were only temporary [[lease]]s, often the Magnates never returned them. This gave rise in the 16th century, to a self-policing trend by the szlachta, known as the ''ruch egzekucji praw'' \u2014 movement for the enforcement of the law - against usurping Magnates to force them to return leased lands back to their rightful owner, the monarch.\n\nOne of the most important victories of the Magnates was the late 16th century right to create ''[[Ordynacja]]s'', similar to [[Fee tail]]s under English law, which ensured that a family which gained landed wealth could more easily preserve it. The ''Ordynacjas'' that belonged to families such as the [[Radziwi\u0142\u0142]], [[Zamoyski]], [[Potocki]] or [[Lubomirski]]s often rivalled the estates of the king and were important power bases for them.\n\nVery high offices of the Polish crown were [[de facto]] \"hereditary\" and guarded by the [[magnate]]ria of Poland, leaving the lower offices below for \"middling\" nobility ([[Baron|\"'''the baronage'''\"]] -- '''SEE:''' '''[[Offices in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]''' for a sense of the hierarchy). The prestige of lower offices depended on the wealth of the region. The [[Masovia]] region of Poland had a long-standing reputation of being rather poor due to the condition of the soil.\n\nThe difference between the ''magnateria'' and the rest of the szlachta was primarily one of wealth and life-style, as both belonged to the same legally defined class being members of the same clans. Consequently, any power wrested from the king by the magnates was consequently trickled down to the entirety of the szlachta. This often meant the rest of the szlachta tended to cooperate with the magnates rather than struggle against them.<ref name=\"dmowski-magnates-szlachta\" />\n\n=== The szlachta's loss of influence ===\n[[File:Galician slaughter in 1846.PNG|thumb|right|[[Galician slaughter|The Peasant Uprising of 1846]], the largest [[peasant uprising]] against ''szlachta'' rulership on Polish lands in the 19th century.]]The notion of the szlachta's accrued sovereignty ended in 1795 with the final [[Partitions of Poland]], and until 1918 their legal status was dependent on the policies of the [[Russian Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] or the [[Habsburg Monarchy]].

All land taken from Polish peasants since 1846 was to be returned to them without redemption payments. The ex-serfs could only sell land to other peasants, not szlachta. 90% of the ex-serfs in the empire who actually gained land after 1861 lived in the 8 western provinces. Along with [[Romania]], Polish landless or domestic serfs were the only ones to be given land after serfdom was abolished.<ref>The End of the Old Order in Rural Europe, Jerome Blum, page 391.</ref> All this was to punish the szlachta's role in the uprisings of 1830 and 1863.\nBy 1864 80% of szlachta were ''d\u00e9class\u00e9'' - downward social mobility.

From the 13th century on the king would appoint a high-ranking courtier to the role of Master of the Hunt, ''[[\u0141owczy]]''. In time, the penalties for poaching were commuted to fines and from around the 14th century, landowners acquired the right to hunt on their land. Small game, foxes, hare, badger and stoat etc. were 'fair game' to all comers. Hunting became one of the most popular social activities of the szlachta until the partitions, when different sets of restrictions in the three territories were introduced. This was with a view to curbing social interaction among the subject Poles.<ref>Cheda, Jacek. (2010) \u0141owiectwo i jego rola w \u017cyciu spo\u0142ecznym Wielkiej Brytanii i Polski.

Since then their legitimacy and fate depended on the legislation and policies of the [[Russian Empire]], [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. Their privileges became increasingly limited, and were ultimately dissolved by the [[March Constitution (Poland)|March Constitution of Poland]] in 1921.\n\nThere were a number of avenues to upward social mobility and the attainment of nobility. The szlachta was not rigidly exclusive or closed as a class, but according to [[heraldic]] sources, the total number of legal ennoblements issued between the 14th and mid-18th century, is estimated at approximately 800.<ref name=\"czajkowski\" /><ref name=\"pudlowski\" /> This is an average of about two ennoblements per year, or 0.000,000,14 \u2013 0.000,001 of the historical population.\n\nAccording to two English journalists [[Richard Holt Hutton]] and [[Walter Bagehot]] writing on the subject in 1864,\n\n{{quote|text=The condition of the country at the present day shows that the population consisted of two different peoples, between whom there was an impassable barrier.

A noble woman married to a commoner could not transmit her nobility to her husband and their children. Any individual could attain ennoblement (''{{lang|pl|nobilitacja}}'') for special services to the state. A foreign noble might be naturalized as a Polish noble through the mechanism called the ''[[Indygenat]]'', certified by the king. Later, from 1641, it could only be done by a [[general sejm]]. By the eighteenth century all these trends contributed to the great increase in the proportion of szlachta in the total population.\n\nIn theory all szlachta members were social equals and were formally legal peers. Those who held civic appointments were more privileged but their roles were not hereditary. Those who held honorary appointments were superior in the hierarchy but these positions were only granted for a lifetime. Some tenancies became hereditary and went with both privilege and title. Nobles who were not direct [[Lessee]]s of the Crown but held land from other lords were only peers \"de iure\". The poorest enjoyed the same rights as the wealthiest magnate. The exceptions were a few symbolically privileged families such as the Radziwi\u0142\u0142, Lubomirski and [[Czartoryski]], who held honorary aristocratic titles bestowed by foreign courts and recognised in Poland which granted them use of titles such as \"Prince\" or \"[[Count]]\". See also [[The Princely Houses of Poland]]. All other szlachta simply addressed each other by their given name or as \"Brother, Sir\" ''Panie bracie'' or the feminine equivalent. The other forms of address would be \"Illustrious and Magnificent Lord\", \"Magnificent Lord\", \"Generous Lord\" or \"Noble Lord\" in descending order, or simply \"His/Her Grace Lord/Lady\".\n\nThe notion that all Polish nobles were social equals, regardless of their financial status or offices held, is enshrined in a traditional Polish [[adage]]:\n\n{{poemquote|''Szlachcic na zagrodzie''\n''r\u00f3wny wojewodzie.''}}\nequivalent to:\n{{poemquote|''The noble on the [[croft (land)|croft]] Is the [[voivode]]'s equal.''}}\n\n=== Szlachta hierarchy ===\nAccording to their wealth, the nobility were divided into:\n* [[Magnates of Poland and Lithuania|magnates]], the wealthiest class: owners of vast lands, towns, many villages, and thousands of peasants\n[[File:150913_Garden_of_the_Branicki_Palace_in_Bia\u0142ystok_-_02.jpg|thumb|left|702px|Magnate palace: [[Branicki Palace, Bia\u0142ystok|Branicki herbu (coat of arms) Gryf family palace]] in [[Bia\u0142ystok|Bia\u0142ystok, Podlaskie province, POLAND.]]]]{{clear}}\n* middle nobility (''\u015brednia szlachta''): owners of one or more villages, often having some official titles, or Envoys from the local Land Assemblies to the General Assembly\n[[File:\u017b\u0105d\u0142o-D\u0105browski_z_D\u0105br\u00f3wki_Herbu_(Coat_of_Arms)_Radwan_Family_Manor_in_Micha\u0142owice_Village,_POLAND.jpg|thumb|left|245px|Middle nobility manor house ([[Manor houses of Polish nobility|dw\u00f3r]]): [[D\u0105browski Manor in Micha\u0142owice|\u017b\u0105d\u0142o-D\u0105browski z D\u0105br\u00f3wki herbu (coat of arms) Radwan family manor]] in [[Micha\u0142owice, Lesser Poland Voivodeship|Micha\u0142owice village]], Micha\u0142owice rural administrative district, Krak\u00f3w county, Lesser Poland province, POLAND.]]{{clear}}\n[[File:Gerson Before the manor.jpg|thumb|right|225px|\"In Front of the Manor House\" by [[Wojciech Gerson]]; Year: 1856 - painting of a lesser szlachta/nobility homestead ([[Manor houses of Polish nobility|dw\u00f3r]])]]\n* [[petty nobility]] (''drobna szlachta''): owners of part of a village or owning no land at all, often referred to by a variety of colourful Polish terms such as:\n**''{{ill|szlachta za\u015bciankowa|pl}}'' \u2013 from ''za\u015bcianek'' (backwater/boondocks/the sticks), poorer members of the szlachta settled together in related families in one village, ''neighborhood/village nobility''. \n**''szaraczkowa'' \u2013 ''grey nobility'', from their grey, [[wool]]len, undyed [[\u017cupan]]s\n**''okoliczna'' \u2013 ''local nobility'', similar to ''za\u015bciankowa''\n**''zagrodowa'' \u2013 from ''zagroda'', a farm, often little different than a peasant's dwelling\n**''zagonowa'' \u2013 from ''zagon'', a small unit of land measure, ''hide nobility''\n**''cz\u0105stkowa'' \u2013 ''partial'', owners of only part of a single village\n**''panek'' \u2013 little ''pan'' (i.e., lordling), term used in [[Kashubia|Kaszuby]], the Kashubian region, also one of the legal terms for legally separated lower nobility in late medieval and early modern Poland\n**''hreczkosiej'' \u2013 ''[[buckwheat]] sowers'' <!--more or less--> \u2013 those who had to work their fields themselves because they had no peasants.\n**''brukowa'' \u2013 ''[[cobblestone|cobble]] nobility'', for those living in towns like townsfolk\n**''go\u0142ota'' \u2013 ''naked nobility'', i.e., the landless; the poorest szlachta considered the \"lowest of the high.\" They were later stripped of voting rights.\n**''p\u00f3\u0142panek'' (\"half-lord\"); also podpanek/pidpanek (\"sub-lord\") in [[Podolia]] and Ukrainian accent<ref>[http://ebuw.uw.edu.pl/dlibra/plain-content?id=7352 Lw\u00f3w i Wilno / &#91;publ. by J.

Its heraldic system evolved together with neighbouring states in [[Central Europe]], while differing in many ways from the heraldry of other European countries. Polish Knighthood had its counterparts, links and roots in [[Moravia]], e.g. [[Poraj coat of arms]] and in [[Germany]], e.g. [[Junosza coat of arms]].\n\nFamilies who had a common origin would also share a coat of arms. They would also share their crest with families adopted into the clan. Sometimes unrelated families would be falsely attributed to a clan on the basis of similarity of crests. Some noble families inaccurately claimed clan membership. The number of coats of arms in this system was comparatively low and did not exceed 200 in the late Middle Ages. There were 40,000 in the late 18th century.\n\nAt the [[Union of Horod\u0142o]], forty-seven families of Catholic Lithuanian lords and boyars were adopted by Polish szlachta families and allowed to use Polish coats of arms.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Frost|first1=Robert I.|title=The Oxford History of Poland-Lithuania: The Making of the Polish-Lithuanian Union, 1385-1569|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=115}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Marian|first1=Biskup|chapter=Polish Diplomacy during the Angewin and Jagiellonian Era (1370-1572): X-XX C|title=The History of Polish Diplomacy: X-XX C|date=2005|publisher=Sejm Publishing Office|page=79}}</ref>\n\n==== Heritability ====\nThe tradition of differentiating between a coat of arms and a [[Lozenge (heraldry)|lozenge]] granted to women, did not develop in Poland. By the 17th century, invariably, men and women inherited a coat of arms from their father. When mixed marriages developed after the partitions, that is between commoners and members of the nobility, as a courtesy, children could claim a coat of arms from their [[distaff]] side, but this was only tolerated and could not be passed on into the next generation. The [[brisure]] was rarely used. All children would inherit the coat of arms and title of their father. This partly accounts for the relatively large proportion of Polish families who had claim to a coat of arms by the 18th century. Another factor was the arrival of titled foreign settlers, especially from the German lands and the Habsburg Empire.\n\nIllegitimate children could adopt the mother's surname and title by the consent of the mother's father, but would sometimes be adopted and raised by the natural father's family, thereby acquiring the father's surname, though not the title or arms.\n\n=== Sarmatism ===\n[[File:Jan Zamoyski.PNG|thumb|right|upright|[[Hetman]] [[Jan Zamoyski]], as a representative of [[Sarmatism]].]]\nThe ''szlachta''{{'}}s prevalent [[ideology]], especially in the 17th and 18th centuries, was manifested in its adoption of \"[[Sarmatism]]\", a word derived from the [[legend]] that its origins reached back to the ancient tribe of an Iranic people, the [[Sarmatians]]. This nostalgic belief system embracing chivalry and courtliness, became an important part of ''szlachta'' culture and affected all aspects of their lives. It was popularized by poets who exalted traditional village life, peace and pacifism. It was also manifested in oriental-style apparel, the ''[[\u017cupan]]'', ''[[kontusz]]'', ''[[sukmana]]'', ''[[pas kontuszowy]]'', ''[[Delia (clothing)|delia]]'' and made the [[scimitar]]-like ''[[szabla]]'' a near-obligatory item of everyday ''szlachta'' apparel. Sarmatism served to integrate a nobility of disparate provenance, as it sought to create a sense of [[nationalism|national]] unity and pride in the szlachta's \"[[Golden Liberty]]\" ''z\u0142ota wolno\u015b\u0107''. It was marked furthermore by a linguistic affectation among the ''szlachta'' of mixing Polish and Latin vocabulary, producing a form of Polish [[Dog Latin]] peppered with \"[[Macaronic language|macaronism]]s\" in everyday conversation.<ref>Wasko, Andrzej.

[[Jan \u0141aski]] or ''Johannes Alasco'' (1499-1560) was a cleric, whose uncle, the eponymous [[Jan \u0141aski (1456-1531)]] was [[Grand Chancellor of the Crown]], Archbishop of Gniezno and [[Primate of Poland]]. His nephew was an early convert to [[Calvinism]] and had a hand in implementing (c. 1543\u20131555) [[English Reformation|Reformation]] in England where he is known as ''John Laski''.\n\nAfter the [[Counter-Reformation]], when the Roman Catholic Church regained power in [[Poland]], the nobility became almost exclusively Catholic. Approximately 45% of the population were Roman Catholic or members of Protestant denominations, 36% were Greek Catholic, 4% Orthodox, of whom some were members of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic]] or the [[Armenian Catholic Church]]es and the [[Georgian Orthodox Church]].

During the [[Partitions of Poland]] from 1772 to 1795, minor szlachta began to lose these legal privileges and social status, while elites became part of the nobility of partitioning countries.\n\nAlthough szlachta members had greatly unequal status due to wealth and political influence, few official distinctions existed between elites and common nobility. Because of the juridic principle of szlachta equality, and a disdain for distinction by way of titles, the relatively few hereditary [[Noble title|titles]] in the Kingdom of Poland were bestowed by foreign monarchs, including personal hereditary titles granted by the [[Papal nobility|Pope]] &mdash; see [[Feliks Soba\u0144ski]]. In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Ruthenia, and Samogitia princely titles were mostly inherited by descendants of Old Lithuanian-Ruthenian [[Rurik dynasty|Rurikid]] and [[Family of Gediminas|Gediminids]] princely families, or by princely dynasties of Tatar origin settled there.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe Polish term ''szlachta'' is derived from the [[Old High German]] word ''slahta''. In modern German ''Geschlecht'' - which originally came from the [[Proto-Germanic]] *''slagiz'', \"blow\", \"strike\", and shares the [[Anglo-Saxon]] root for \"slaughter\" or the verb \"to slug\" \u2013 means \"breeding\" or gender. Like many other Polish words pertaining to nobility, it derives from Germanic words: the Polish for a \"knight\" is \"''rycerz''\", a [[cognate]] of the German \"''Ritter''\". The Polish word for \"coat of arms\" is \"''herb''\" from the German \"''Erbe''\" or \"heritage\".\n17th century Poles assumed \"''szlachta''\" came from the German \"''schlachten''\" \"to slaughter\" or \"to butcher\", and was therefore related to the German word for battle, \"''Schlacht''\". Some early Polish historians thought the term might have derived from the name of the legendary proto-Polish chief, [[Lech, Czech and Rus|Lech]], mentioned in Polish and Czech writings. In [[Gaels|Gaelic]] society, large landholders with hereditary tenures formed the principal lineages of their own \"clans\" or \"[[sept]]s,\" and they were traced to a ''[[Sept|sliocht]]'', or branch, of the ruling families.<ref>{{cite journal\n| last = McInerney\n| first = Luke\n| date = 2018\n| title = A List of Freeholders of Kilfenora Diocese in 1601\n| jstor = 26605109\n| journal = Eolas: The Journal of the American Society of Irish Medieval Studies\n| location = [[Maple Grove, Minnesota|Maple Grove]], [[Hennepin County|Hennepin county]], [[Minnesota|MINNESOTA]], U.S.A.\n| publisher = American Society of Irish Medieval Studies\n| volume = 11\n| pages = 60\u2013103\n| quote = This stratum of landholders were usually large freeholders with hereditary tenures.

The Polish tribes were internalized and organized around a unifying religious cult, governed by the ''[[Veche|wiec]]'', an assembly of free tribesmen. Later, when safety required power to be consolidated, an elected prince was chosen to govern. The election privilege was usually limited to elites.<ref name=\"bardach202627\" />\n\nThe tribes were ruled by clans ([[:pl:R\u00f3d|''r\u00f3d'']]) consisting of people related by blood or marriage and theoretically descending from a common ancestor,<ref name=\"radwan-family-line\" /> giving the r\u00f3d/clan a highly developed sense of solidarity. (See ''[[gens]]''.) The ''[[starosta]]'' (or ''starszyna'') had judicial and military power over the r\u00f3d/clan, although this power was often exercised with an assembly of elders. Strongholds called ''[[Gord (Slavic settlement)|gr\u03ccd]]'' were built where the religious cult was powerful, where trials were conducted, and where clans gathered in the face of danger. The ''opole'' was the territory occupied by a single tribe. {{Harv|Manteuffel|1982|p=44}} The family unit of a tribe is called the ''rodzina'', while a collection of tribes is a [[:pl:Plemi\u0119|''plemi\u0119'']].\n\n[[Mieszko I of Poland]] (c. 935 \u2013 25 May 992) established an elite knightly retinue from within his army, which he depended upon for success in uniting the [[Lechites|Lekhitic]] tribes and preserving the unity of his state. Documented proof exists of Mieszko I's successors utilizing such a retinue, as well.\n\nAnother class of knights were granted land by the prince, allowing them the economic ability to serve the prince militarily. A Polish nobleman living at the time prior to the 15th century was referred to as a \"rycerz\", very roughly equivalent to the English \"knight,\" the critical difference being the status of \"rycerz\" was almost strictly hereditary;<ref name=\"szacki--inherited--1995\" /><ref name=\"topor-jakubowski--1998\" /> the class of all such individuals was known as the \"rycerstwo\".<ref name=\"topor-jakubowski--1998\" /> Representing the wealthier families of Poland and itinerant knights from abroad seeking their fortunes, this other class of rycerstwo, which became the szlachta/nobility (\"szlachta\" becomes the proper term for Polish nobility beginning about the 15th century), gradually formed apart from Mieszko I's and his successors' elite retinues. This rycerstwo/nobility obtained more privileges granting them favored status. They were absolved from particular burdens and obligations under ducal law, resulting in the belief only rycerstwo (those combining military prowess with high/noble birth) could serve as officials in state administration.\n\nSelect rycerstwo were distinguished above the other rycerstwo, because they descended from past tribal dynasties, or because early [[Piast dynasty|Piasts']] endowments made them select beneficiaries. These rycerstwo of great wealth were called mo\u017cni (Magnates).

The prior social structure was one of Polish tribes united into the historic Polish nation under a state ruled by the [[Piast dynasty]], this dynasty appearing circa 850 A.D.\n\nSome mo\u017cni (Magnates) descending from past tribal dynasties regarded themselves as co-proprietors of Piast realms, even though the Piasts attempted to deprive them of their independence.

In Lithuanian, nobles were named ''ponai''. The higher nobility were named ''kunigai'' or ''kunigaik\u0161\u010diai'' (dukes) \u2014 a loanword from Scandinavian ''[[konung]]''. They were the established local leaders and warlords. During the development of the state, they gradually became subordinated to higher dukes, and later to the [[King of Lithuania]]. Because of Lithuanian expansion into the lands of [[Ruthenia]] in the middle of the 14th century, a new term for nobility appeared \u2014 ''bajorai'', from [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] ''\u0431\u043e\u044f\u0440\u0435''. This word is used to this day in Lithuania to refer to nobility in general, including those from abroad.\n\nAfter the [[Union of Horod\u0142o]], the Lithuanian nobility acquired equal status with its Polish counterparts. Over time they became increasingly [[polonized]], although they did preserve their [[nation]]al consciousness, and in most cases recognition of their Lithuanian family roots. In the 16th century, some of the Lithuanian nobility claimed that they were descended from the Romans, and that the [[Lithuanian language]] was derived from Latin. This led to a conundrum: Polish nobility claimed its own ancestry from [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] tribes, but Sarmatians were considered enemies of the Romans. Thus, a new Roman-Sarmatian theory was created. Strong cultural ties with Polish nobility led to a new term for Lithuanian nobility appearing in the 16th century \u2014 ''\u0161l\u0117kta'', a direct loanword from Polish ''szlachta''. Recently, Lithuanian linguists advocated dropping the usage of this Polish loanword.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kiaupien\u0117 |first=J\u016brat\u0117 |author-link=J\u016brat\u0117 Kiaupien\u0117 |year=2003 |title=\"Mes, Lietuva\": Lietuvos Did\u017eiosios Kunigaik\u0161tyst\u0117s bajorija XVI a. |trans-title=\"We the Lithuania\": nobility of Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 16th c. |language=Lithuanian |publisher=Kronta |isbn=9955-595-08-6 |page=64}}</ref>\n\nThe process of [[polonization]] took place over a lengthy period. At first only the leading members of the nobility were involved. Gradually the wider population became affected.

Many noble Ruthenian families intermarried with Lithuanians.\n\nThe rights of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] nobles were nominally equal to those enjoyed by the Polish and Lithuanian nobility, but they were put under cultural pressure to convert to Catholicism. It was a policy that was greatly eased in 1596 by the [[Union of Brest]].

Initially, this privilege could be granted by the monarch, but from 1641 onward, this right was reserved for the [[sejm]]. Most often the individual being ennobled would join an existing noble szlachta clan and assume the undifferentiated [[Polish heraldry|coat of arms]] of that clan.\n\nAccording to [[heraldic]] sources, the total number of legal ennoblements issued between the 14th century and the mid-18th century is estimated at approximately 800.<ref name=\"czajkowski\" /><ref name=\"pudlowski\" /> This is an average of only about two ennoblements per year, or only 0.000,000,14 \u2013 0.000,001 of the historical population.

This can most readily be explained in terms of the ongoing decline and eventual collapse of the Commonwealth and the resulting need for soldiers and other military leaders (see: [[Partitions of Poland]], King [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]]).\n\n==== Estimated number of ennoblements ====\n[[File:Stanis\u0142aw Szcz\u0119sny Potocki.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''Count [[Stanis\u0142aw Szcz\u0119sny Potocki]] with children'', by [[Johann Baptist von Lampi the Elder]].]]\nAccording to [[heraldic]]<ref name=\"czajkowski\" /><ref name=\"pudlowski\" /> sources 1,600 is the total estimated number of all legal ennoblements throughout the history of Kingdom of Poland and Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth from the 14th century onward (half of which were performed in the final years of the late 18th century).\n\nTypes of ennoblement:\n* [[Adopcja herbowa]] \u2013 The \"old way\" of ennoblement, popular in the 15th century, connected with adoption into an existing noble clan by a powerful lord, but abolished in the 17th century.\n* [[Skartabellat]] \u2013 Introduced by [[Pacta conventa (Poland)|pacta conventa]] of the 17th century, this was ennoblement into a sort of \"conditional\" or \"graduated nobility\" status. Skartabels could not hold public offices or be members of the Sejm, but after three generations, the descendants of these families would \"mature\" to full szlachta status.\n* [[Indygenat]] \u2013 from the Latin expression, ''indigenatus'', recognition of foreign noble status. A foreign noble, after acquiring indygenat status, received all privileges of a Polish szlachcic. In Polish history, 413 foreign noble families were recognized. Prior to the 17th century this was done by the King and [[Sejm]], after the 17th century it was done only by the Sejm.\n* \"secret ennoblement\" \u2013 This was of questionable legal status and was often not recognized by many szlachta members. It was typically granted by the elected monarch without the required legal approval of the Sejm.\n\n=== In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania ===\nIn the late 14th century, in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], [[Vytautas the Great]] reformed the Grand Duchy's army: instead of calling all men to arms, he created forces comprising professional warriors\u2014''[[bajorai]]'' (\"nobles\"; see the [[cognate]] \"''[[boyar]]''\"). As there were not enough nobles, Vytautas trained suitable men, relieving them of labor on the land and of other duties; for their [[military service]] to the Grand Duke, they were granted land that was worked by hired men ([[veldamas|veldam]]s). The newly formed noble families generally took up, as their [[family name]]s, the [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] pagan [[given name]]s of their ennobled ancestors; this was the case with the [[Go\u0161tautai]], [[Radvilos]], [[Astikai]], [[K\u0119sgailos]] and others. These families were granted their [[coats of arms]] under the [[Union of Horodlo]] (1413).\n\nIn 1506, King [[Sigismund I the Old]] confirmed the position of the [[Lithuanian Council of Lords]] in state politics and limited entry into the [[nobility]].\n\n== Privileges ==\n{{main|Szlachta's privileges}}\n\nSpecific rights of the szlachta included:\n[[File:Bellotto Election of Stanislas Augustus.jpg|thumb|Election of [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]] in 1764]]\n# The right to hold outright ownership of land ([[Allod]]) -- not as a fief, conditional upon service to the liege Lord, but absolutely in perpetuity unless sold.

Many nobles were, in fact, usurpers who were commoners that had moved to another part of the country and falsely claimed noble status.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} Hundreds of such \"false nobles\" were denounced by Hieronim Nekanda Trepka in his ''\"Liber generationis plebeanorum\"'', or ''\"Liber chamorum\"'', in the first half of the 16th century. The law forbade non-nobles to own ''folwarks'' and promised such estates as a reward to denouncers.

Often, members of the lower szlachta sought further ennoblement from foreign, therefore less verifiable, sources. That is, they might acquire by legitimate means or otherwise, such as by purchase, one of a selection of foreign titles ranging from [[Baron]], [[Marchese]], [[Freiherr]] to [[Count|Comte]], all readily translatable into the Polish ''[[Hrabia]]''. Alternatively, they would simply appropriate a title by conferring it upon themselves. An example of this is cited in the case of the last descendant of the [[Andrzej Ciechanowiecki|Ciechanowiecki family]], who managed to restore a genuinely old [[Comital]] title, but whose actual origins are shrouded in 18th-century mystery.<ref>{{cite journal|author= Andrzej Rachuba, \"Panowie z Ciechanowa\"|title= Kronika Zamkowa 1-2/59-60|page=33|date = 2010|url=http://mazowsze.hist.pl/16/Kronika_Zamkowa/356/2010/12307/ }} In Polish with an English summary.

Over time, each new monarch ceded to them further privileges. Those privileges became the basis of the ''[[Golden Liberty]]'' in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. Despite having a king, Poland was considered the 'nobility's [[Rzeczpospolita|Commonwealth]]' because [[Royal elections in Poland]] were in the hands of members of a hereditary class. Poland was therefore the domain of this class, and not that of the king or the ruling [[dynasty]]. This arose in part because of the extinction of male heirs in the original royal dynasties: first, the [[Piasts]], then the [[Jagiellons]]. As a result, the nobility took it upon itself to choose \"the Polish king\" from among the dynasties' [[Matrilineality|matrilinial]] descendants.\n\nPoland's successive kings granted privileges to the nobility upon their election to the throne - the privileges having been specified in the king-elect's [[Pacta conventa (Poland)|Pacta conventa]] - and at other times, in exchange for ''[[ad hoc]]'' leave to raise an extraordinary tax or a ''[[pospolite ruszenie]]'', a military call up. Poland's nobility thus accumulated a growing array of privileges and immunities.\n\nIn 1355 in [[Buda]] King [[Casimir III of Poland|Casimir III the Great]]<!--or Louis the Hungarian? sources vary! needs verification!--> issued the first country-wide privilege for the nobility, in exchange for their agreeing that if Casimir had no male heirs, the throne would pass to his nephew, [[Louis I of Hungary]]. Casimir further decreed that the nobility would no longer be subject to 'extraordinary' taxes or have to use their own funds for foreign military expeditions. Casimir also promised that when the royal court toured, the king and the court would cover all expenses, instead of requiring facilities to be provided by the local nobility.\n\n==== The Privilege of Koszyce and others ====\nIn 1374 [[Louis I of Hungary|King Louis of Hungary]] approved the [[Privilege of Koszyce]] (''przywilej koszycki'') to guarantee the Polish throne for his daughter, [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]]. He broadened the definition of membership of the nobility and exempted the entire class from all but one tax (''\u0142anowy'') a limit of 2 [[grosz]]es per ''\u0142an'' of land, [[Old Polish units of measurement]]. In addition, the King's right to raise taxes was effectively abolished: no new taxes would be levied without the agreement of the nobility. Henceforth, [[Offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth#District offices|district offices]] were also reserved exclusively for local nobility, as the Privilege of Koszyce forbade the king to grant official posts and major Polish castles to foreign knights. Finally, the privilege obliged the king to pay [[indemnity|indemnities]] to nobles injured or taken captive during a war outside Polish borders.\n\nIn 1422 [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o|King W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o]] was constrained by the Privilege of Czerwi\u0144sk (''przywilej czerwi\u0144ski''), which established the inviolability of nobles' property. Their estates could not be confiscated except upon the verdict of a court. It also made him cede some jurisdiction over [[fiscal policy]] to the [[Privy council|Royal Council]], later, the [[Senate of Poland]], including the right to [[mint (coin)|mint coinage]].\n\nIn 1430, with the Privileges of [[Jedlnia]], confirmed at [[Krak\u00f3w]] in 1433, Polish: ''przywileje jedlne\u0144sko-krakowskie'', based partially on his earlier [[Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski]] privilege (April 25, 1425), King W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o granted the nobility a guarantee against arbitrary arrest, similar to the English [[Magna Carta]]'s [[habeas corpus]], known from its own Latin name as \"[[neminem captivabimus]] nisi jure victum\". Henceforth, no member of the nobility could be imprisoned without a [[arrest warrant|warrant]] from a court of justice. The king could neither punish nor imprison any noble on a whim. King W\u0142adys\u0142aw's ''[[quid pro quo]]'' for the [[easement]] was the nobles' guarantee that the throne would be inherited by one of his sons, who would be bound to honour the privileges granted earlier to the nobility. On May 2, 1447 the same king issued the ''[[Wilno Pact]], or Wilno Privilege'', which gave the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuanian]] [[boyar]]s the same rights as those already secured by the Polish ''szlachta''.\n[[File:Rembrandt. A Polish Nobleman. 1637.PNG|right|thumb|upright|''[[A Polish Nobleman]]''. [[Rembrandt]], 1637]]\n\nIn 1454, [[Kazimierz IV Jagiellon|King Casimir IV]] granted the [[Nieszawa Statutes]] - Polish: ''statuty cerkwicko-nieszawskie'', clarifying the legal basis of [[voivodship]] [[sejmik]]s - local parliaments. The king could [[promulgation|promulgate]] new laws, raise taxes, or call for a mass military call up ''pospolite ruszenie'', only with the consent of the sejmiks, and the nobility were protected from judicial abuses. The Nieszawa Statutes also curbed the power of the magnates, as the Sejm, the national parliament, had the right to elect many officials, including judges, [[Voivode|voivods]] and [[castellan]]s. These privileges were demanded by the ''szlachta'' in exchange for their participation in the [[Thirteen Years' War (1454\u201366)|Thirteen Years' War]].\n\n==== First Royal Election ====\nThe first \"[[Royal elections in Poland|free election]]\" (Polish: ''wolna elekcja'') of a king took place in 1492. In fact, some earlier Polish kings had been elected with help from assemblies such as those that put [[Casimir II of Poland|Casimir II]] on the throne, thereby setting a precedent for free elections. Only [[senator]]s voted in the 1492 free election, which was won by [[John I Albert]]. For the duration of the [[Jagiellonian Dynasty]], only members of that royal family were considered for election. Later, there would be no restrictions on the choice of candidates.\n\nIn 1493 the Sejm, began meeting every two years at [[Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski|Piotrk\u00f3w]]. It comprised two chambers:\n* a [[Senat]]e of 81 [[bishop]]s and [[Offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth#Senatorial offices|other dignitaries]] \n* a Chamber of Deputies of 54 deputies representing their respective domains.\nThe numbers of senators and deputies later increased.\n\nOn April 26, 1496 King [[John I Albert]] granted the [[Privilege of Piotrk\u00f3w]]. The [[Statutes of Piotrk\u00f3w]] increased the nobility's [[feudal]] power over [[serfs]]. It bound the peasant to the land, and only one son though not the eldest, was permitted to leave the village. Townsfolk ''mieszcza\u0144stwo'' were prohibited from owning land. Positions in the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] hierarchy were restricted to nobles.\n\nOn 23 October 1501, the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian union]] was reformed by the [[Union of Mielnik]]. It was there that the tradition of a [[coronation Sejm]] was founded. Here again, the lesser nobility, lesser in wealth only - not in rank - attempted to reduce the power of the Magnates with a law that made them [[impeachment|impeachable]] before the Senate for [[malfeasance]]. However, the [[Act of Mielnik]] of 25 October did more to strengthen the Magnate-dominated [[Senate of Poland]] than the lesser nobility. Nobles as a whole were given the right to disobey the King or his representatives \u2014 ''non praestanda oboedientia'', and to form [[konfederacja|confederations]], armed opposition against the king or state officials if the nobles found that the law or their legitimate privileges were being infringed.\n[[File:Pot\u0119ga Rzeczypospolitej u zenitu. Z\u0142ota wolno\u015b\u0107. Elekcja R.P. 1573.jpg|thumb|right|''The Commonwealth's Power at Its Zenith, [[Golden Liberty]], the [[Royal elections in Poland|Election]] of 1573''. Painting by [[Jan Matejko]]]]\n\nOn 3 May 1505 King [[Alexander I Jagiellon]] granted the Act of ''[[Nihil novi]] nisi commune consensu'' - \"I accept nothing new except by common consent\". This forbade the king to pass new laws without the consent of the representatives of the nobility in the assembled Sejm, thus greatly strengthening the nobility's powers. Essentially, this act marked the transfer of legislative power from the king to the Sejm. It also marks the beginning of the [[First Rzeczpospolita]], the period of a ''szlachta''-run \"Commonwealth\".\n\nIn 1520 the Act of Bydgoszcz granted the Sejm the right to convene every four years, with or without the king's permission. At about that time the ''Executionist Movement'', seeking to oversee law enforcement, began to take shape. Its members sought to curb the power of the Magnates at the Sejm and to strengthen the power of the monarch. In 1562 at the Sejm in Piotrk\u00f3w they forced the Magnates to return many leased [[Krolewszczyzna|crown lands]] to the king, and the king to create a standing army [[wojsko kwarciane]]. One of the most famous members of this movement was [[Jan Zamoyski]].\n\n==== End of the Jagiellonian dynasty ====\n[[File:Anjou 1570louvre.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Henry III of France|Henry of Valois]], first elected monarch of Poland-Lithuania]]\nUntil the death of [[Sigismund II Augustus]], the last king of the [[Jagiellonian]] dynasty, all monarchs had to be elected from within the royal family. However, from 1573, practically any Polish noble or foreigner of royal blood could potentially become a [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish\u2013Lithuanian]] monarch. Every newly elected king was supposed to sign two documents: the ''[[Pacta conventa (Poland)|Pacta conventa]]'', the king's \"pre-election pact\", and the ''[[Henrican articles]]'', named after the first freely elected king, [[Henry III of France|Henry of Valois]]. The latter document was a virtual ''Polish constitution'' and contained the basic laws of the Commonwealth:\n* Free election of kings\n* [[Religious freedom in Poland|Religious tolerance]]\n* The Sejm to meet every two years\n* Foreign policy controlled by the Sejm\n* A royal advisory council chosen by the Sejm\n* Official posts restricted to Polish and Lithuanian nobles\n* Taxes and monopolies set up by the Sejm only\n* Nobles' right to disobey the Monarch should s/he break any of these laws.\n\nIn 1578 king, [[Stefan Batory]], created the [[Crown Tribunal]] to reduce the enormous pressure on the [[Court (royal)|Royal Court]]. This placed much of the monarch's juridical power in the hands of the elected szlachta deputies, further strengthening the nobility as a class. In 1581 the Crown Tribunal was joined by a counterpart in Lithuania, the [[Lithuanian Tribunal]].\n\n=== Transformation into aristocracy ===\n[[File:Posiadlosci magnaterii w XVI-XVII w.svg|thumb|right|[[Ownership|Possession]]s of major magnate families in 16th\u201317th century.]]\n{{main|Magnates of Poland and Lithuania}}\nFor many centuries, wealthy and powerful members of the szlachta sought to gain legal privileges over their peers. Few szlachta were wealthy enough to be known as Magnates, ''karmazyni'', the \"[[Crimson]]s\" - from the crimson colour of their boots. A true Magnate had to be able to trace his ancestry for many generations and own at least 20 villages or estates. He also had to hold high [[offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|office in the Commonwealth]].\n\n{{Citation needed|Some historians estimate the number of Magnates as 1% of the szlachta's total|date=November 2018}}. Thus, out of about one million szlachta, only 200\u2013300 persons could be classed as great Magnates with country-wide possessions and influence. Of these some 30\u201340 were considered as having significant impact on Poland's politics. Magnates often received gifts from monarchs, which greatly increased their wealth. Although such gifts were only temporary [[lease]]s, often the Magnates never returned them. This gave rise in the 16th century, to a self-policing trend by the szlachta, known as the ''ruch egzekucji praw'' \u2014 movement for the enforcement of the law - against usurping Magnates to force them to return leased lands back to their rightful owner, the monarch.\n\nOne of the most important victories of the Magnates was the late 16th century right to create ''[[Ordynacja]]s'', similar to [[Fee tail]]s under English law, which ensured that a family which gained landed wealth could more easily preserve it. The ''Ordynacjas'' that belonged to families such as the [[Radziwi\u0142\u0142]], [[Zamoyski]], [[Potocki]] or [[Lubomirski]]s often rivalled the estates of the king and were important power bases for them.\n\nVery high offices of the Polish crown were [[de facto]] \"hereditary\" and guarded by the [[magnate]]ria of Poland, leaving the lower offices below for \"middling\" nobility ([[Baron|\"'''the baronage'''\"]] -- '''SEE:''' '''[[Offices in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]''' for a sense of the hierarchy). The prestige of lower offices depended on the wealth of the region. The [[Masovia]] region of Poland had a long-standing reputation of being rather poor due to the condition of the soil.\n\nThe difference between the ''magnateria'' and the rest of the szlachta was primarily one of wealth and life-style, as both belonged to the same legally defined class being members of the same clans. Consequently, any power wrested from the king by the magnates was consequently trickled down to the entirety of the szlachta. This often meant the rest of the szlachta tended to cooperate with the magnates rather than struggle against them.<ref name=\"dmowski-magnates-szlachta\" />\n\n=== The szlachta's loss of influence ===\n[[File:Galician slaughter in 1846.PNG|thumb|right|[[Galician slaughter|The Peasant Uprising of 1846]], the largest [[peasant uprising]] against ''szlachta'' rulership on Polish lands in the 19th century.]]The notion of the szlachta's accrued sovereignty ended in 1795 with the final [[Partitions of Poland]], and until 1918 their legal status was dependent on the policies of the [[Russian Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] or the [[Habsburg Monarchy]].

All land taken from Polish peasants since 1846 was to be returned to them without redemption payments. The ex-serfs could only sell land to other peasants, not szlachta. 90% of the ex-serfs in the empire who actually gained land after 1861 lived in the 8 western provinces. Along with [[Romania]], Polish landless or domestic serfs were the only ones to be given land after serfdom was abolished.<ref>The End of the Old Order in Rural Europe, Jerome Blum, page 391.</ref> All this was to punish the szlachta's role in the uprisings of 1830 and 1863.\nBy 1864 80% of szlachta were ''d\u00e9class\u00e9'' - downward social mobility.

From the 13th century on the king would appoint a high-ranking courtier to the role of Master of the Hunt, ''[[\u0141owczy]]''. In time, the penalties for poaching were commuted to fines and from around the 14th century, landowners acquired the right to hunt on their land. Small game, foxes, hare, badger and stoat etc. were 'fair game' to all comers. Hunting became one of the most popular social activities of the szlachta until the partitions, when different sets of restrictions in the three territories were introduced. This was with a view to curbing social interaction among the subject Poles.<ref>Cheda, Jacek. (2010) \u0141owiectwo i jego rola w \u017cyciu spo\u0142ecznym Wielkiej Brytanii i Polski.

A noble woman married to a commoner could not transmit her nobility to her husband and their children. Any individual could attain ennoblement (''{{lang|pl|nobilitacja}}'') for special services to the state. A foreign noble might be naturalized as a Polish noble through the mechanism called the ''[[Indygenat]]'', certified by the king. Later, from 1641, it could only be done by a [[general sejm]]. By the eighteenth century all these trends contributed to the great increase in the proportion of szlachta in the total population.\n\nIn theory all szlachta members were social equals and were formally legal peers. Those who held civic appointments were more privileged but their roles were not hereditary. Those who held honorary appointments were superior in the hierarchy but these positions were only granted for a lifetime. Some tenancies became hereditary and went with both privilege and title. Nobles who were not direct [[Lessee]]s of the Crown but held land from other lords were only peers \"de iure\". The poorest enjoyed the same rights as the wealthiest magnate. The exceptions were a few symbolically privileged families such as the Radziwi\u0142\u0142, Lubomirski and [[Czartoryski]], who held honorary aristocratic titles bestowed by foreign courts and recognised in Poland which granted them use of titles such as \"Prince\" or \"[[Count]]\". See also [[The Princely Houses of Poland]]. All other szlachta simply addressed each other by their given name or as \"Brother, Sir\" ''Panie bracie'' or the feminine equivalent. The other forms of address would be \"Illustrious and Magnificent Lord\", \"Magnificent Lord\", \"Generous Lord\" or \"Noble Lord\" in descending order, or simply \"His/Her Grace Lord/Lady\".\n\nThe notion that all Polish nobles were social equals, regardless of their financial status or offices held, is enshrined in a traditional Polish [[adage]]:\n\n{{poemquote|''Szlachcic na zagrodzie''\n''r\u00f3wny wojewodzie.''}}\nequivalent to:\n{{poemquote|''The noble on the [[croft (land)|croft]] Is the [[voivode]]'s equal.''}}\n\n=== Szlachta hierarchy ===\nAccording to their wealth, the nobility were divided into:\n* [[Magnates of Poland and Lithuania|magnates]], the wealthiest class: owners of vast lands, towns, many villages, and thousands of peasants\n[[File:150913_Garden_of_the_Branicki_Palace_in_Bia\u0142ystok_-_02.jpg|thumb|left|702px|Magnate palace: [[Branicki Palace, Bia\u0142ystok|Branicki herbu (coat of arms) Gryf family palace]] in [[Bia\u0142ystok|Bia\u0142ystok, Podlaskie province, POLAND.]]]]{{clear}}\n* middle nobility (''\u015brednia szlachta''): owners of one or more villages, often having some official titles, or Envoys from the local Land Assemblies to the General Assembly\n[[File:\u017b\u0105d\u0142o-D\u0105browski_z_D\u0105br\u00f3wki_Herbu_(Coat_of_Arms)_Radwan_Family_Manor_in_Micha\u0142owice_Village,_POLAND.jpg|thumb|left|245px|Middle nobility manor house ([[Manor houses of Polish nobility|dw\u00f3r]]): [[D\u0105browski Manor in Micha\u0142owice|\u017b\u0105d\u0142o-D\u0105browski z D\u0105br\u00f3wki herbu (coat of arms) Radwan family manor]] in [[Micha\u0142owice, Lesser Poland Voivodeship|Micha\u0142owice village]], Micha\u0142owice rural administrative district, Krak\u00f3w county, Lesser Poland province, POLAND.]]{{clear}}\n[[File:Gerson Before the manor.jpg|thumb|right|180px|\"In Front of the Manor House\" by [[Wojciech Gerson]]; Year: 1856 - painting of a lesser szlachta/nobility homestead ([[Manor houses of Polish nobility|dw\u00f3r]])]]\n* [[petty nobility]] (''drobna szlachta''): owners of part of a village or owning no land at all, often referred to by a variety of colourful Polish terms such as:\n**''{{ill|szlachta za\u015bciankowa|pl}}'' \u2013 from ''za\u015bcianek'' (backwater/boondocks/the sticks), poorer members of the szlachta settled together in related families in one village, ''neighborhood/village nobility''. \n**''szaraczkowa'' \u2013 ''grey nobility'', from their grey, [[wool]]len, undyed [[\u017cupan]]s\n**''okoliczna'' \u2013 ''local nobility'', similar to ''za\u015bciankowa''\n**''zagrodowa'' \u2013 from ''zagroda'', a farm, often little different than a peasant's dwelling\n**''zagonowa'' \u2013 from ''zagon'', a small unit of land measure, ''hide nobility''\n**''cz\u0105stkowa'' \u2013 ''partial'', owners of only part of a single village\n**''panek'' \u2013 little ''pan'' (i.e., lordling), term used in [[Kashubia|Kaszuby]], the Kashubian region, also one of the legal terms for legally separated lower nobility in late medieval and early modern Poland\n**''hreczkosiej'' \u2013 ''[[buckwheat]] sowers'' <!--more or less--> \u2013 those who had to work their fields themselves because they had no peasants.\n**''brukowa'' \u2013 ''[[cobblestone|cobble]] nobility'', for those living in towns like townsfolk\n**''go\u0142ota'' \u2013 ''naked nobility'', i.e., the landless; the poorest szlachta considered the \"lowest of the high.\" They were later stripped of voting rights.\n**''p\u00f3\u0142panek'' (\"half-lord\"); also podpanek/pidpanek (\"sub-lord\") in [[Podolia]] and Ukrainian accent<ref>[http://ebuw.uw.edu.pl/dlibra/plain-content?id=7352 Lw\u00f3w i Wilno / &#91;publ. by J.

Its heraldic system evolved together with neighbouring states in [[Central Europe]], while differing in many ways from the heraldry of other European countries. Polish Knighthood had its counterparts, links and roots in [[Moravia]], e.g. [[Poraj coat of arms]] and in [[Germany]], e.g. [[Junosza coat of arms]].\n\nFamilies who had a common origin would also share a coat of arms. They would also share their crest with families adopted into the clan. Sometimes unrelated families would be falsely attributed to a clan on the basis of similarity of crests. Some noble families inaccurately claimed clan membership. The number of coats of arms in this system was comparatively low and did not exceed 200 in the late Middle Ages. There were 40,000 in the late 18th century.\n\nAt the [[Union of Horod\u0142o]], forty-seven families of Catholic Lithuanian lords and boyars were adopted by Polish szlachta families and allowed to use Polish coats of arms.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Frost|first1=Robert I.|title=The Oxford History of Poland-Lithuania: The Making of the Polish-Lithuanian Union, 1385-1569|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=115}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Marian|first1=Biskup|chapter=Polish Diplomacy during the Angewin and Jagiellonian Era (1370-1572): X-XX C|title=The History of Polish Diplomacy: X-XX C|date=2005|publisher=Sejm Publishing Office|page=79}}</ref>\n\n==== Heritability ====\nThe tradition of differentiating between a coat of arms and a [[Lozenge (heraldry)|lozenge]] granted to women, did not develop in Poland. By the 17th century, invariably, men and women inherited a coat of arms from their father. When mixed marriages developed after the partitions, that is between commoners and members of the nobility, as a courtesy, children could claim a coat of arms from their [[distaff]] side, but this was only tolerated and could not be passed on into the next generation. The [[brisure]] was rarely used. All children would inherit the coat of arms and title of their father. This partly accounts for the relatively large proportion of Polish families who had claim to a coat of arms by the 18th century. Another factor was the arrival of titled foreign settlers, especially from the German lands and the Habsburg Empire.\n\nIllegitimate children could adopt the mother's surname and title by the consent of the mother's father, but would sometimes be adopted and raised by the natural father's family, thereby acquiring the father's surname, though not the title or arms.\n\n=== Sarmatism ===\n[[File:Jan Zamoyski.PNG|thumb|right|upright|[[Hetman]] [[Jan Zamoyski]], as a representative of [[Sarmatism]].]]\nThe ''szlachta''{{'}}s prevalent [[ideology]], especially in the 17th and 18th centuries, was manifested in its adoption of \"[[Sarmatism]]\", a word derived from the [[legend]] that its origins reached back to the ancient tribe of an Iranic people, the [[Sarmatians]]. This nostalgic belief system embracing chivalry and courtliness, became an important part of ''szlachta'' culture and affected all aspects of their lives. It was popularized by poets who exalted traditional village life, peace and pacifism. It was also manifested in oriental-style apparel, the ''[[\u017cupan]]'', ''[[kontusz]]'', ''[[sukmana]]'', ''[[pas kontuszowy]]'', ''[[Delia (clothing)|delia]]'' and made the [[scimitar]]-like ''[[szabla]]'' a near-obligatory item of everyday ''szlachta'' apparel. Sarmatism served to integrate a nobility of disparate provenance, as it sought to create a sense of [[nationalism|national]] unity and pride in the szlachta's \"[[Golden Liberty]]\" ''z\u0142ota wolno\u015b\u0107''. It was marked furthermore by a linguistic affectation among the ''szlachta'' of mixing Polish and Latin vocabulary, producing a form of Polish [[Dog Latin]] peppered with \"[[Macaronic language|macaronism]]s\" in everyday conversation.<ref>Wasko, Andrzej.

His nephew was an early convert to [[Calvinism]] and had a hand in implementing (c. 1543\u20131555) [[English Reformation|Reformation]] in England where he is known as ''John Laski''.\n\nAfter the [[Counter-Reformation]], when the Roman Catholic Church regained power in [[Poland]], the nobility became almost exclusively Catholic.

The three ships\u2014{{HMS|Furious|47|2}}, {{HMS|Courageous|50|2}} and {{HMS|Glorious||2}}\u2014were originally laid down as [[Courageous-class battlecruiser]]s as part of the [[Baltic Project]] during the [[Naval warfare of World War I|First World War]]. While very fast, their minimal armour and few guns limited their long-term utility in the post-war Royal Navy, and they were [[Reserve Fleet (United Kingdom)|laid up]] after the war. They were considered [[capital ship]]s by the terms of the 1922 [[Washington Naval Treaty]] and were included in the total amount of tonnage allowed to the Royal Navy. Rather than [[ship breaking|scrap]] them, the Navy decided to convert them to aircraft carriers as permitted under the Treaty.\n\n''Furious'', already partially converted during the war, began her reconstruction in 1921, before the Treaty came into effect. In an attempt to minimise air turbulence, she was given no [[superstructure]] or [[Glossary of nautical terms#I|island]]. This was not entirely satisfactory, and a small island was added in 1939. Another problem was that she lacked a standard [[funnel (ship)|funnel]]; instead, her [[boiler]] uptakes ran along the sides of the ship and exhausted out of gratings on the rear of the [[flight deck]], or at the sides of the ship if landing operations were in progress. The long ducts reduced her aircraft capacity, and the exhaust gases were as much of a problem for landing aircraft as the turbulence would have been. Her [[sister ship|half-sisters]], ''Courageous'' and ''Glorious'', began their conversions to aircraft carriers as ''Furious'' neared completion. They drew upon the experience gained by the Royal Navy since ''Furious'' had been designed and incorporated an island with a funnel, increasing their aircraft capacity by one-third and making it safer to land.\n\nAs the first large carrier completed by the Royal Navy, ''Furious'' was extensively used to evaluate aircraft handling and landing procedures, including the first-ever carrier night landing in 1926. ''Courageous'' became the first warship lost by the Royal Navy in the Second World War when she was [[torpedo]]ed in September 1939 by a German [[U-boat|submarine]]. ''Glorious'' participated in the [[Norwegian campaign]] in 1940, but she was sunk by two German [[battleship]]s in June as she sailed home with a minimal escort. ''Furious'' participated in many major operations during the war, including the Norwegian campaign in 1940, the [[Malta Convoys]] and ''[[Operation Torch]]'' in 1942, and airstrikes on the {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz}} and other targets in Norway in 1944. The ship was worn out by 1944 and was placed in [[Reserve fleet|reserve]] status in September 1944 before being [[Ship commissioning#Ship decommissioning|paid off]] in 1945 and sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] in 1948.\n\n== Careers as battlecruisers ==\n{{Main|Courageous-class battlecruiser}}\n\n[[File:HMS Glorious (1917) profile drawing.png|thumb|left|''Glorious'' as a battlecruiser]]\nThe first two ships of the class, ''Courageous'' and ''Glorious'', spent the First World War on [[North Sea]] patrols, climaxing in the [[Second Battle of Heligoland Bight]] in November 1917. Their half-sister ''Furious'' was designed with a pair of {{convert|18|in|0|adj=on}} guns\u2014as opposed to four {{convert|15|in|0|adj=on}}\u2014but was modified while being built to hold a flying-off deck and [[hangar]] in lieu of her forward [[gun turret|turret]] and [[barbette]]. She made some patrols in the North Sea before her rear turret was removed and another flight deck added. Her aircraft attacked [[Zeppelin]] sheds during the [[Tondern raid]] in July 1918.<ref>Roberts, p. 123</ref>\n\nAll three ships were reduced to reserve after the war. The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 limited the signatory nations to a set amount of capital ship tonnage; all ships in excess of this figure had to be scrapped. Up to {{convert|66000|LT|t|lk=on}} of existing ships could be converted into aircraft carriers, and the Royal Navy decided to use the ''Courageous''-class ships due to their high speed. Each ship was reconstructed with a flight deck during the 1920s.<ref>Friedman, p. 97</ref>\n\n== Conversions ==\n[[File:HMS Furious-2.jpg|thumb|left|''Furious'' as she was during the First World War with separate take-off and landing decks and superstructure in between]]\n[[File:Dunning Landing-on Furious In Pup.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Sopwith Pup]] unsuccessfully attempting to land on ''Furious''{{'}}s forward flight deck, 7 August 1917]]\n{{HMS|Furious|47|2}} had been fitted during the First World War with a flying-off and landing deck, but the latter proved largely unusable because of the strong air currents around the superstructure and exhaust gases from the funnel. She was laid up after the war, but was converted to an aircraft carrier between June 1921 and September 1925. Her design was based on the very limited experience gained with the first two British carriers: {{HMS|Argus|I49|2}}, less than three years old, and {{HMS|Eagle|1918|2}}, which had carried out only 143 deck landings during preliminary [[sea trial]]s in 1920.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 263\u2013267</ref><ref>Burt 2012, p. 252</ref><ref>Brown, p. 252</ref>\n\n''Furious''{{'}}s superstructure, masts, funnel and landing deck were removed and she was given a {{convert|576|by|92|ft|m|1|adj=on}} flight deck that extended over three-quarters of her length. This flight deck was not level; it sloped upwards about three-quarters of the way from the stern to help slow down landing aircraft, which had no brakes at the time it was designed. That era's fore-and-aft [[arresting gear]], initially {{convert|320|ft|1}} long on ''Furious'', was not intended to stop landing aircraft\u2014the landing speeds of the time were low enough that this was unnecessary given a good headwind\u2014but rather to prevent aircraft from veering off to one side and potentially falling off the flight deck. Various designs for the flight deck were tested in a wind tunnel by the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] which showed that the distinctive elliptical shape and rounded edges minimised turbulence. To minimise any turbulence over the flight deck, ''Furious'' was flush-decked and lacked an island, like ''Argus''; instead she was provided with a retractable [[Glossary of nautical terms#C|charthouse]] at the forward end of the flight deck.<ref>Friedman, pp. 93\u201395</ref>\n\nA two-[[storey]] hangar was built under the flight deck, each level being {{convert|15|ft|1|abbr=on}} high. The lower hangar was {{convert|550|ft|1|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|35|-|50|ft|1|abbr=on}} wide and the upper was {{convert|520|by|50|ft|1|abbr=on}}. Each hangar could be sectioned off by electrically operated steel shutters on rollers. Her boilers were ducted down the side of the ship to exhaust either out of gratings at the rear of the flight deck, or, when landing operations were in progress, out of the side of the lower hangar at the rear of the ship. This solution proved to be very unsatisfactory as it consumed valuable space, made parts of the lower hangar unbearable and interfered with landing operations to a greater or lesser degree. Her original flying-off deck remained in place for use by small aircraft like [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] so that the ship could simultaneously land aircraft on the main flight deck while fighters were taking off on the lower deck and could speedily launch her aircraft from both decks. Doors at the forward end of the upper hangar opened onto the lower flying deck.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 264\u2013265</ref> Two {{convert|47|by|46|ft|m|adj=on|1}} lifts (elevators) were installed to transfer aircraft between the flight deck and hangars. Two {{convert|600|impgal|l USgal|adj=on}} ready-use [[petrol]] tanks were provided for aircraft and the ship's boats on the upper deck. An additional {{convert|20000|impgal|l USgal}} of petrol were in bulk storage. The longitudinal arresting gear proved unpopular in service and it was ordered removed in 1927 after tests aboard ''Furious'' in 1926 had shown that deck-edge palisades were effective in reducing cross-deck gusts that could blow aircraft over the side.<ref>Friedman, pp. 94\u201395</ref> ''Furious''{{'}}s long exhaust ducting hampered landing operations, and restricted the size of the hangars and thus the number of aircraft that she could carry.<ref name=\"Friedmanpp\">Friedman, pp. 103, 105\u2013106</ref>\n\n''Glorious'' and ''Courageous'' were converted to aircraft carriers after ''Furious'' began her reconstruction, ''Courageous'' at [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport]] starting on 29 June 1924, and ''Glorious'' at [[Rosyth]] on 14 February 1924. The latter was moved to Devonport to complete the conversion after ''Furious'' was finished. Their design was based on ''Furious'' with a few improvements based on experience gained since she was designed. All superstructure, guns, and fittings down to the main deck were removed. A two-storey hangar, each level {{convert|16|ft|1|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|550|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} long, was built on top of the remaining hull; the upper hangar level opened onto a short flying-off deck, below and forward of the main flight deck. Two slightly larger {{convert|46|by|48|ft|m|adj=on|1}} lifts were installed fore and aft in the flight deck. An island was added on the starboard side with the bridge, flying control station, and funnel, as an island did not create as much turbulence as had been earlier feared. By 1939 both ships could carry {{convert|34500|impgal|l USgal}} of petrol.<ref name=\"Friedmanpp\" />\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:HMS Glorious underway 1936.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of ''Glorious'', 1936]]\nThe ''Courageous''-class ships had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|786|ft|9|in|m|1|abbr=on}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|90|ft|6|in|m|1|abbr=on}}, and a [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|28|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} at [[deep load]]. These were increases of {{convert|9|ft|6|in|m|1|abbr=on}} in beam and over {{convert|2|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} in draught compared to their earlier incarnations as battlecruisers. They displaced {{convert|24210|LT|t|lk=on}} at normal load and {{convert|26990|LT|t|abbr=on}} at deep load, increases of over {{convert|3000|LT|t}}.

She displaced {{convert|22500|LT|t}} at normal load and {{convert|26500|LT|t|abbr=on}} at deep load, over 3,000 long tons more than her previous displacement of {{convert|19513|LT|t}} at load and {{convert|22890|LT|t}} at deep load. ''Furious''{{'}}s metacentric height was {{convert|3.6|ft|1|abbr=on}} at deep load, a reduction of {{convert|1.48|ft|1|abbr=on}} after her conversion.<ref name=r65 /> In 1932, ''Furious'' had a complement of 738 officers and ratings, plus 468 men in her air group.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 266, 273</ref>\n\n=== Propulsion ===\nThe ''Courageous''-class ships were the first large warships in the Royal Navy to have geared [[steam turbine]]s. Arranged in two engine rooms, each of the turbines drove one of the four [[propeller shaft]]s. ''Furious''{{'}}s propellers were {{convert|11|ft|6|in|m|1|abbr=on}} in diameter. The turbines were powered by 18 [[Yarrow Shipbuilders|Yarrow]] small-tube boilers equally divided among three boiler rooms. The turbines were designed to produce a total of {{convert|90000|shp|lk=on}} at a working pressure of {{convert|235|psi|kPa kg/cm2|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}.<ref>Roberts, pp. 71, 76</ref> No significant changes to the machinery were made during the conversion process to any of the three ships, but their increased displacement reduced their speed to approximately {{convert|30|kn|lk=in}}.<ref name=f5>Friedman, p. 95</ref>\n\n''Furious''{{'}}s fuel capacity was increased by {{convert|700|LT|t}} during her reconstruction, which increased her range to {{convert|7480|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}.<ref name=f3 /> The maximum fuel capacity of ''Courageous'' and ''Glorious'' was increased during the conversion to {{convert|3800|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]],<ref name=b83>Burt 2012, p. 283</ref> giving them an endurance of {{convert|6630|nmi|abbr=on}} at 10 kn.<ref name=f3>Friedman, p. 363</ref>\n\n=== Armament ===\n[[File:British gun, skansin (Faroe Islands).jpg|thumb|left|300px|One of the 5.5-inch guns from ''Furious'', redeployed in the Faeroes]]\n''Furious'' retained ten of her original eleven [[breech-loading]] [[BL 5.5 inch Mark I naval gun|BL 5.5-inch Mk I]] guns, five on each side, for self-defence from enemy warships.<ref name=b69 /> They fired {{convert|82|lb|kg|adj=on}} projectiles at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|2790|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. Their maximum range was {{convert|16000|yd|m}} at their maximum elevation of 25\u00b0, and the rate of fire was 12 rounds per minute.<ref>Campbell, p. 40</ref>\n\nHalf a dozen [[QF 4 inch Mk V naval gun|QF 4-inch Mark V]] guns replaced her original [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] guns. Four were mounted on the sides of the flying-off deck and two on the [[quarterdeck]].<ref>Burt 2012, p. 267</ref> They had a maximum depression of \u22125\u00b0 and a maximum elevation of 80\u00b0. The guns fired a {{convert|31|lb|kg|adj=on}} [[Explosive material#High explosives|high explosive]] (HE) shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2387|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} at a rate of 10 to 15 rounds per minute. The guns had a maximum ceiling of {{convert|31000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, but an effective range of much less.<ref>Campbell, p. 58</ref> The four guns on the flying-off deck were removed during trials of the lower flight deck in 1926\u20131927, but only two were replaced when the trials were concluded.<ref name=f9>Friedman, p. 109</ref>\n\nFour single [[QF 2 pounder naval gun|QF 2-pounder ''pom-poms'']] were installed by 1927.<ref name=f9 /> During ''Furious''{{'}}s September 1930 \u2013 February 1932 refit, her anti-aircraft outfit was changed by the substitution of two 8-barrel 2-pounder ''pom-pom'' mounts for the forward 4-inch guns on the flying-off deck removed earlier.<ref name=b69>Burt 2012, p. 276</ref> The Mark V mount could depress to \u221210\u00b0 and elevate to a maximum of 80\u00b0. The Mark VIII 2-pounder gun fired a {{convert|40|mm|adj=on|order=flip}} {{convert|0.91|lb|kg|adj=on}} shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|1920|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} to a distance of {{convert|3800|yd|m}}. The gun's rate of fire was approximately 96\u201398 rounds per minute.<ref>Campbell, pp. 71\u201374</ref>\n\nThe {{convert|5.5|in|adj=on}} and {{convert|4|in|adj=on|0}} guns were replaced during ''Furious''{{'}}s refit in early 1939 by a dozen [[QF 4 inch Mk XVI naval gun|QF 4-inch Mk XVI guns]] in twin [[dual purpose gun|dual-purpose]] Mark XIX mounts. One mount each was on the former flying-off deck and the quarterdeck while the other four were mounted two per side.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 268\u201369, 276</ref> The Mark XIX mount could depress to \u221210\u00b0 and elevate to a maximum of 80\u00b0. The Mark XVI gun fired  fifteen to twenty {{convert|35|lb|kg|adj=on}} HE shells per minute at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2660|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. Against surface targets it had a range of {{convert|19850|yd|m|abbr=on}} and a maximum ceiling of {{convert|31000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, but an effective anti-aircraft range of much less.<ref>Campbell, p. 56</ref> Two more Mark V 2-pounder mounts were added fore and aft of the newly added island at the same time.<ref name=b69 />\n\nDuring the Second World War, ''Furious'', the only surviving ship of the three, received an eventual total of 22 manually operated automatic [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|20&nbsp;mm Oerlikon]] light anti-aircraft (AA) guns, which replaced the single quadruple Vickers 0.50-calibre machine gun mount.<ref name=f9 /> The Oerlikon fired a {{convert|0.272|lb|adj=on}} HE shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2750|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. The maximum ceiling was 10,000 ft and the maximum range was {{convert|4800|yd|abbr=on}} although the effective range was under {{convert|1000|yd|abbr=on}}. The cyclic rate of fire was 450 rounds per minute, but the practical rate was between 250 and 320 rounds per minute owing to the need to reload [[magazine (firearms)|magazines]].<ref>Campbell, pp. 75\u201376</ref>\n\nA mix of single-purpose anti-surface and anti-aircraft guns in various sizes was considered for ''Courageous'' and ''Glorious'' by the [[Admiralty]], but was ultimately rejected for a dual-purpose armament of sixteen [[QF 4.7 inch Mk VIII naval gun|QF 4.7-inch Mark VIII]] guns in single high-angle mounts. One mount was on each side of the lower flight deck and a pair were on the quarterdeck. The remaining twelve mounts were distributed along the sides of each ship.<ref name=b83 /> These mounts could depress to \u22125\u00b0 and elevate to a maximum of 90\u00b0. The Mark VIII guns fired a {{convert|50|lb|kg|adj=on}} HE shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2457|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} at a rate of 8\u201312 rounds per minute. The guns had a maximum ceiling of {{convert|32000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, but an effective range of much less. They had a maximum range of {{convert|16160|yd|m|abbr=on}} against surface targets.<ref>Campbell, p. 51</ref>\n\nDuring refits in the mid-1930s, both ships received multiple 2-pounder ''pom-pom'' mounts. ''Courageous'' received three quadruple Mark VII mounts, one on each side of the flying-off deck, forward of the 4.7-inch guns, and one behind the island on the flight deck (two of these were transferred from the battleship {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|05|2}}). ''Glorious'' received three octuple Mark VI mounts in the same locations. Both ships received four water-cooled [[Vickers .50 machine gun|0.50-calibre Mark III]] [[machine gun]]s in a single quadruple mounting.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 157, 286</ref> This mount could depress to \u221210\u00b0 and elevate to a maximum of 70\u00b0. The machine guns fired a {{convert|1.326|oz|adj=on}} bullet at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2520|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. This gave the gun a maximum range of about {{convert|5000|yd|m|abbr=on}}, although its effective range was only {{convert|800|yd|m|abbr=on}}.<ref>Campbell, p. 78</ref> Neither ship had any further guns added before they were sunk early in the war,<ref name=f9 /> in 1939 and 1940, respectively.\n\n=== Fire control and radar ===\nTo assist its weapon systems in hitting their target, ''Furious'' was completed with one [[fire-control system]] for each side, with separate [[Fire-control system#Naval fire control|directors]] for low-angle and high-angle guns. The 5.5-inch guns were centrally controlled by a [[Frederic Charles Dreyer#Dreyer Fire Control Table|Dreyer Fire-Control Table]] on the lower deck while the 4-inch guns had their mechanical computers next to their directors.<ref name=f5 /> The existing fire-control directors were removed when ''Furious'' received her new dual-purpose 4-inch mountings in 1939. New high-angle directors, including two for the ''pom-poms'', were mounted on top of the new island and on the former lower flight deck. Over the course of the war [[Type 285 radar|Type 285]] gunnery [[radar]]s were mounted on top of the high-angle directors. She also received a [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 290|Type 290]] air-search radar.<ref name=f9 />\n\n''Courageous'' was initially fitted only with low-angle directors for her guns, but these were replaced by dual-purpose directors when she was refitted in 1930. (''Glorious'', completed later, had hers from the beginning.) Neither ship was fitted with radar before its early loss.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 285\u201386</ref>\n\n=== Protection ===\nLittle armour other than that of the [[barbette]]s was removed during their conversion to aircraft carriers. The transverse bulkheads were carried through the locations of the former barbettes. The flight deck was {{convert|0.625|in|mm}} in thickness.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 273, 282</ref>\n\nUnlike other British battlecruisers, the bulk of the armour of the ''Courageous''-class ships was made from [[Ultimate tensile strength|high-tensile]] steel (HTS), a type of steel used structurally in other ships. Their waterline [[Belt armor|belt]] consisted of {{convert|2|in|0}} of HTS covered by a {{convert|1|in|0|adj=on}} thick mild steel skin. It protected roughly the middle two-thirds of the ship with a one-inch extension forward to the two-inch forward transverse [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]] well short of the bow. The belt had a height of {{convert|23|ft|m|0}}, of which {{convert|18|in|m|1}} was below the designed waterline. From the former forward barbette, a 3-inch bulkhead extended out to the ship's side between the upper and lower decks and a comparable bulkhead was in place at the former location of the rear barbette as well. Four decks were armoured with thicknesses varying from {{convert|0.75|\u2013|3|in}}, thickest over the magazines and the steering gear. After the [[Battle of Jutland]], {{convert|110|LT|t}} of extra protection was added to the deck around the magazines.<ref>Burt 1986, pp. 308, 313</ref>\n\nThe [[torpedo bulkhead]]s were increased during building from 0.75\u2013{{convert|1.5|in|abbr=on}} in thickness.<ref>Roberts, pp. 54, 106, 113</ref> All three ships were fitted with a shallow [[anti-torpedo bulge]] integral to the hull, which was intended to detonate the torpedo before it hit the hull proper and deflect the underwater explosion to the surface, away from the ship. Later testing proved that it was not deep enough to accomplish its task and that it lacked the layers of empty and full compartments that were necessary to absorb the force of the explosion.<ref>Roberts, p. 111</ref>\n\n=== Air groups ===\n[[File:HMS Furious-15.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Furious'' in the mid-1930s with a flight of [[Blackburn Baffin]] torpedo bombers overhead]]\nNormally, ''Furious'' could carry only about 36 aircraft. In the 1920s this commonly meant one flight (squadrons after 1932) of fighters ([[Fairey Flycatcher]]), two of spotters ([[Blackburn Blackburn]] or [[Avro Bison]]), one spotter reconnaissance ([[Fairey III]]D) and two flights of torpedo bombers ([[Blackburn Dart]]). In 1935 there was one squadron of fighters with [[Hawker Nimrod]]s and [[Hawker Osprey]]s, one squadron of [[Blackburn Baffin]] torpedo bombers and one squadron of Fairey IIIF spotters. During the Second World War, the carrier typically carried a single fighter squadron and two of strike aircraft of various types, although the mix was often adjusted for specific missions.<ref name=b69 />\n\n''Courageous'' and ''Glorious'' were generally similar except that they carried a total of 48 aircraft. They commonly flew the same types of aircraft as ''Furious'', although they are also known to have flown the [[Fairey Seal]], the [[Blackburn Shark]], and the [[Blackburn Ripon]].<ref>Burt 2012, p. 284</ref>\n\n== Pre-war service ==\n''Furious'' was assigned to the [[Atlantic Fleet (United Kingdom)|Atlantic Fleet]] after commissioning in 1925, although she spent much of the next several years conducting trials for practically every aircraft in the [[Fleet Air Arm]] (FAA) inventory. These included landing and flying-off tests of Fairey IIID and Fairey Flycatcher [[floatplane]]s, with and without wheels, to compare various designs of wooden and metal floats. The lower flight deck was greased to allow them to take off with a minimum of difficulty. A Flycatcher fitted with wooden skids was also tested and behaved perfectly satisfactorily.<ref name=f9 /><ref>Burt 2012, pp. 270\u2013272</ref> The arresting gear was barely used during these trials and it was removed shortly afterwards. Deck-edge [[palisade]]s ([[windbreak]]s) were installed in 1927 to keep aircraft from blowing over the side in rough weather.<ref name=f5 /><ref>Jenkins, p. 271</ref> The first carrier night-landing was made by a Blackburn Dart on 6 May 1926 aboard ''Furious''.<ref>Jenkins, p. 274</ref>\n\nThe ship was reduced to reserve status on 1 July 1930 in preparation for a lengthy overhaul at Devonport from September 1930 to February 1932, focused on refitting her machinery and re-tubing her boilers.<ref name=b0>Burt 2012, p. 270</ref> In addition her quarterdeck was raised by one deck, the AA armament was revised and water spraying facilities were fitted in the hangars.<ref>Jenkins, pp. 275\u2013276</ref> Upon completion she ran a full-power trial on 16 February 1932 where her maximum speed was {{convert|28.8|kn|abbr=on}} from a total of {{convert|89754|shp|abbr=on}}.<ref name=b0 />\n\n''Furious'' was recommissioned in May 1932 as part of the Home Fleet with a reduced crew before being brought up to full complement in November.<ref name=j6>Jenkins, p. 276</ref> Transverse arresting gear was fitted sometime during the mid-1930s. She was detached to the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] from May to October 1934. ''Furious'' was present at the Coronation [[Fleet Review]] at [[Spithead]] on 20 May 1937 for King [[George VI]]. She became a deck-landing training carrier in 1937, although she was refitted between December 1937 and May 1938 in Devonport, where the forward end of her lower flight deck was raised to make her less wet forward. During the [[Munich Crisis]] in September 1938, she embarked Nos. [[801 Naval Air Squadron|801]], [[821 Naval Air Squadron|821]] and [[822 Naval Air Squadron|822 Squadrons]] and joined the fleet at [[Scapa Flow]], before resuming her training duties after the peaceful conclusion of the affair.<ref name=\"b69\" /><ref name=j6 />\n\nShe was given a more extensive refit from January to May 1939 that removed her 5.5-inch guns and palisades, mounted AA guns on her flying-off deck, plated in the doors at the forward end of the upper hangar, and gave her a small island on the starboard side. ''Furious'' resumed her training duties after the completion of the refit and continued them until October 1939.<ref>Jenkins, pp. 277\u2013278</ref>\n\n[[File:HMS Courageous (50).jpg|thumb|left|''Courageous'' at anchor ({{circa|1935}})]]\n''Courageous'' was recommissioned on 21 February 1928 and assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet from May 1928 to June 1930. She was relieved by ''Glorious'' and refitted from June to August 1930. The ship was assigned to the Atlantic and Home Fleets from 12 August 1930 to December 1938 aside from a temporary attachment to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1936. In the early 1930s, transverse arresting gear was installed and she received two hydraulic [[aircraft catapult|catapults]] on the upper flight deck before March 1934. ''Courageous'' was refitted again between October 1935 and June 1936 and received her ''pom-pom'' mounts. She was also present at the 1937 Coronation Fleet Review. She became a training carrier in December 1938 when {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|2}} joined the Home Fleet and continued on that duty until the start of the Second World War.<ref name=b15>Burt 2012, pp. 285\u2013286, 290</ref>\n\n[[File:HMS Glorious anchored.jpg|thumb|right|''Glorious'' at anchor (circa 1934)]]\n''Glorious'' was recommissioned on 24 February 1930 for service with the Mediterranean Fleet, but was attached to the Home Fleet from March to June 1930. She relieved ''Courageous'' in the Mediterranean Fleet in June 1930 and remained there until October 1939. In a fog on 1 April 1931 ''Glorious'' rammed SS ''Florida'' amidships while steaming at {{convert|16|knots|abbr=on}}. The impact crumpled {{convert|60|ft|1|abbr=on}} of the flying-off deck and forced ''Glorious'' to put into [[Gibdock|Gibraltar]] for temporary repairs. She had to sail to [[Malta Dockyard|Malta]] for permanent repairs which lasted until September 1931. Sometime in the early 1930s, transverse arresting gear was installed. She was refitted at Devonport from July 1934 to July 1935 where she received two catapults, her flight deck was extended to the rear, her quarterdeck was raised one deck and she received her multiple ''pom-pom'' mounts. ''Glorious'' also participated in the 1937 Coronation Fleet Review before returning to the Mediterranean.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 285\u2013288</ref>\n\n== Second World War ==\n=== ''Courageous'' ===\n[[File:HMS Courageous sinking.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Courageous'' sinking]]\nIn the early days of the war, [[Hunter-killer Group|hunter-killer groups]] were formed around the fleet aircraft carriers to find and destroy U-boats. On 17 September 1939, two torpedoes from {{GS|U-29|1936|2}} turned the tables, and ''Courageous'' became the first British warship sunk in the Second World War. As ''Ark Royal'' had been surprised by a near-miss seven days earlier, the fleet carriers were withdrawn from this duty.<ref>Rohwer, pp. 1\u20133</ref>\n\n=== ''Glorious'' ===\nForce J, including ''Glorious'', was organised to hunt for the {{ship|German pocket battleship|Admiral Graf Spee}} in the Indian Ocean. They were not successful, and ''Glorious'' remained in the Indian Ocean until December when she was transferred to the Mediterranean.\n\n''Glorious'' was recalled to the Home Fleet in April 1940 to provide air cover for British forces landing in [[Norwegian Campaign|Norway]].<ref>Burt 2012, p. 285</ref> [[Gloster Gladiators]] of [[No. 263 Squadron RAF]] were flown aboard to be transferred to Norwegian airbases. ''Glorious'' and ''Ark Royal'' arrived off central Norway on 24 April where 263 Squadron was flown off and their organic aircraft attacked targets in the [[Trondheim]] area before ''Glorious'' had to return to Scapa Flow on 27 April to refuel and embark new aircraft. She returned on 1 May, after failing to load new aircraft because of poor weather. The task force was under heavy air attack by the [[Luftwaffe]] all day and was withdrawn that evening.<ref>Haarr, pp. 143\u2013154</ref>\n\n''Glorious'' returned on 18 May with six [[Supermarine Walrus]] [[Amphibious aircraft|amphibious]] [[flying boat]]s of [[701 Naval Air Squadron|701 Squadron]] and 18 [[Hawker Hurricane]]s of [[No. 46 Squadron RAF]]. The Walruses were flown off to [[Harstad]], but the airfield at [[Sk\u00e5nland]] was not yet ready for the Hurricanes and they were still aboard when ''Glorious'' returned to Scapa on 21 May. ''Glorious'' came back to the [[Narvik]] area on 26 May and the Hurricanes were flown off.<ref>Haarr, pp. 261\u2013262</ref>\n\nBritish forces were ordered withdrawn a few days later. The evacuation (''[[Operation Alphabet]]'') began in the north on the night of 3/4 June, and ''Glorious'' arrived off the coast on 2 June to provide support. She carried only nine Sea Gladiators of [[802 Naval Air Squadron|802 Squadron]] and six Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers of [[823 Naval Air Squadron|823 Squadron]] for self-defence, as it was hoped to evacuate the RAF fighters if possible. Ten Gladiators of 263 Squadron were flown aboard during the afternoon of 7 June and the Hurricanes of 46 Squadron were also flown aboard without any significant problems in the early evening despite having a much higher landing speed than the biplanes.<ref>Haarr, pp. 308\u2013310</ref> This was the first time that high performance monoplanes without [[tailhook]]s had been landed on an aircraft carrier.<ref name=h61>Howland, p. 61</ref>\n\nCaptain [[Guy D'Oyly-Hughes]] requested and was granted permission to proceed independently to Scapa Flow in the early hours of 8 June. On the way back across the [[North Sea]], ''Glorious'' and her two escorting destroyers, {{HMS|Acasta|H09|2}} and {{HMS|Ardent|H41|2}}, were found by the two German battleships {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}}.<ref>Haarr, pp. 329\u2013330</ref> No [[combat air patrol]] was being flown, no aircraft were spotted on the deck for quick take off and there was no lookout in the [[crow's nest]].<ref>Howland, p. 52</ref> The German heavy ships sank all three British vessels with most of their crews, although ''Acasta'' managed to torpedo ''Scharnhorst'' before she was sunk. Only 43 men from ''Glorious'' survived.<ref>Rohwer, p. 26</ref>\n\n=== ''Furious'' ===\nUntil 2 October 1939, ''Furious'' remained on training duties, combined with anti-submarine sweeps off the east coast of Scotland.<ref>Jenkins, p. 277</ref> She was then assigned to the Home Fleet to replace the sunken ''Courageous'' and sortied on 8 October with the fleet to hunt unsuccessfully for the ''Gneisenau'' and escorting ships which had been spotted off southern Norway. ''Furious'' departed her berth adjacent to the battleship {{HMS|Royal Oak|08|2}} in Scapa Flow for more futile searches for German ships on 13 October, the day before ''Royal Oak'' was sunk by {{GS|U-47|1938|2}} in Scapa Flow. ''Furious'' served as the flagship for the convoy bringing most of the [[1st Canadian Infantry Division]] to Britain in mid-December 1939.<ref>Jenkins, p. 279</ref>\n\n''Furious'' joined the Home Fleet off the coast of Norway on 10 April 1940 and her Swordfish made several attacks on German ships in Narvik on the following days. She refuelled at [[Troms\u00f8]] on the 14th and remained behind after the bulk of the Home Fleet departed on 15 April, her aircraft flying reconnaissance missions until ordered home on 25 April. Her port inner turbine had been damaged by the shock wave from a near miss on 18 April, and the damage was more serious than initially thought. After quick repairs, ''Furious'' returned on 18 May carrying the Gladiators of a reformed 263 Squadron; they were flown off on 21 May once their base at [[Bardufoss Air Station|Bardufoss]] was ready. She sailed to Scapa Flow once all the Gladiators had been flown off.<ref>Haarr, pp. 139\u2013141, 261</ref>\n\nOn 14 June, carrying only half of [[816 Naval Air Squadron|816 Squadron]] for her own protection, ''Furious'' sailed unescorted for [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]] carrying \u00a318,000,000 in gold [[bullion]]. On 1 July she escorted a convoy of Canadian troops bound for [[Iceland]] from Halifax and ferried over almost 50 aircraft, spare parts and munitions. On his own initiative, Captain [[Thomas Hope Troubridge|Troubridge]] ordered all available space should be used for sugar bound for Britain. She reembarked her aircraft upon her arrival and made a number of air strikes on shipping in Norwegian waters and on the seaplane base at Troms\u00f8 through October 1940.<ref>Jenkins, p. 283</ref> ''Furious'' loaded 55 aircraft in [[Liverpool]] on 7 November and sailed for [[Takoradi]], [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]], on 15 November where the aircraft were flown off on 27 November to reinforce fighter units defending [[Desert Air Force|Egypt]]. By 15 December, ''Furious'' was back in Liverpool, where she embarked 40 Hurricanes for Takoradi. She sailed on 21 December and joined up with [[Convoy WS 5A]] which encountered the {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper||2|up=y}} on 25 December. The German ship was driven off by the escorts, and ''Furious'' reached Takoradi on 10 January 1941. She arrived in Britain on 5 February where she was given a brief refit. She made another ferry trip to Takoradi between 4 and 22 March.<ref>Nailer, pp. 154\u2013155</ref>\n\nNow with a new destination for her ferry trips, ''Furious'' transported two dozen Hurricanes to Gibraltar on 25 April where they were transferred to ''Ark Royal'' to be flown off for [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|Malta]]. She returned for another load of Hurricanes and arrived back in Gibraltar on 18 May. Some of these fighters were moved to ''Ark Royal'' via planks between the flight decks of the carriers berthed stern to stern. This time she accompanied ''Ark Royal'' and the two carriers flew off their fighters from a position south of Sardinia. She would repeat this ferry mission three more times from June to September 1941.<ref>Nailer, p. 165</ref> In July and August, ''Furious'' and {{HMS|Victorious|R38|2}} attacked German installations in the Arctic areas of Norway and Finland with limited success and heavy losses. Following her last ferry mission she was sent to [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, to refit.<ref>Jenkins, p. 284</ref>\n\n[[File:A Supermarine Seafire being brought up onto the flight deck of HMS FURIOUS, August 1944. A25076.jpg|thumb|A [[Supermarine Seafire]] being brought up onto the flight deck of ''Furious'', August 1944]]\n\n''Furious'' arrived back in the UK in April 1942 and spent the next three months [[Glossary of nautical terms#W|working up]]. In August she was detailed to accompany the convoy bound for Malta in [[Operation Pedestal]], but she was to sail with them only far enough to allow her 38 [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s to reach Malta. This she did, just as ''Eagle'' was torpedoed, but ''Furious'' turned around after flying off her fighters and reached Gibraltar successfully. She loaded another batch of 32 Spitfires on 16 August and they were flown off the following day south-east of the [[Balearic Islands]]. After this mission ''Furious'' was sent back to Home Fleet for training. One last mission was necessary to reinforce the defences of Malta before [[Operation Torch]], and she arrived on 27 October. She loaded 32 Spitfires and launched them on the 29th before returning to Gibraltar to participate in Torch.<ref>Nailer, pp. 164\u2013165</ref>\n\nProviding cover for the Central Task Force, ''Furious''{{'}}s aircraft neutralised the airfields at [[Es S\u00e9nia|La Senia]] and [[Tafraoui]], both near [[Oran]], Algeria. She remained with Force H until February 1943 before transferring to Home Fleet where she remained for the rest of the war. In July the Home Fleet demonstrated off the coast of Norway in strength to distract attention from the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]]; ''Furious''{{'}}s role was to allow a German reconnaissance aircraft to spot the British ships and make a report then shoot it down.<ref>Jenkins, pp. 284\u2013285</ref> She was refitted in August and spent the rest of the year training.<ref name=b2>Burt 2012, p. 277</ref>\n\nOn 3 April 1944, [[Fairey Barracuda]]s from ''Furious'' and ''Victorious'' attacked the German battleship ''Tirpitz'' in [[Altafjord]], Norway, as part of [[Operation Tungsten]]. ''Tirpitz'' was hit 14 times and needed three months to complete her repairs, although four aircraft were lost in the attack. The Home Fleet tried another attack on ''Tirpitz'' later in the month, but bad weather prevented any attack from being made. Instead the aircraft attempted to attack installations at [[Bod\u00f8]], but found a German convoy instead and sank three ships. Three operations against targets in northern Norway, including two against ''Tirpitz'', had to be abandoned or diverted to other targets in May, but three German ships were sunk and two more were set afire. ''Furious'' and other carriers made another attempt to sink the ''Tirpitz'' on 17 July, but were unsuccessful against the fully alerted German defences. Four more attacks on ''Tirpitz'' were made in August, but only the attack on the 24th was even partially successful as two minor hits were made.<ref>Rohwer, pp. 314, 320, 322, 343, 350\u2013351</ref>\n\nAs the war progressed, the ship's age and limitations became increasingly apparent, and ''Furious'' was placed in reserve on 15 September 1944. She was [[paid off]] in April 1945 and used to evaluate the effects of aircraft explosives on the ship's structure. She was sold in 1948 for scrap, which was completed in 1954 at [[Troon]].<ref name=b2 />\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book|last=Brown|first=David|title=HMS Eagle|series=Warship Profile|volume=35|year=1973|publisher=Profile Publications|location=Windsor, Berkshire, UK|oclc=33084560}}\n* {{cite book|last=Burt|first=R.

The three ships\u2014{{HMS|Furious|47|2}}, {{HMS|Courageous|50|2}} and {{HMS|Glorious||2}}\u2014were originally laid down as [[Courageous-class battlecruiser]]s as part of the [[Baltic Project]] during the [[Naval warfare of World War I|First World War]]. While very fast, their minimal armour and few guns limited their long-term utility in the post-war Royal Navy, and they were [[Reserve Fleet (United Kingdom)|laid up]] after the war. They were considered [[capital ship]]s by the terms of the 1922 [[Washington Naval Treaty]] and were included in the total amount of tonnage allowed to the Royal Navy. Rather than [[ship breaking|scrap]] them, the Navy decided to convert them to aircraft carriers as permitted under the Treaty.\n\n''Furious'', already partially converted during the war, began her reconstruction in 1921, before the Treaty came into effect. In an attempt to minimise air turbulence, she was given no [[superstructure]] or [[Glossary of nautical terms#I|island]]. This was not entirely satisfactory, and a small island was added in 1939. Another problem was that she lacked a standard [[funnel (ship)|funnel]]; instead, her [[boiler]] uptakes ran along the sides of the ship and exhausted out of gratings on the rear of the [[flight deck]], or at the sides of the ship if landing operations were in progress. The long ducts reduced her aircraft capacity, and the exhaust gases were as much of a problem for landing aircraft as the turbulence would have been. Her [[sister ship|half-sisters]], ''Courageous'' and ''Glorious'', began their conversions to aircraft carriers as ''Furious'' neared completion. They drew upon the experience gained by the Royal Navy since ''Furious'' had been designed and incorporated an island with a funnel, increasing their aircraft capacity by one-third and making it safer to land.\n\nAs the first large carrier completed by the Royal Navy, ''Furious'' was extensively used to evaluate aircraft handling and landing procedures, including the first-ever carrier night landing in 1926. ''Courageous'' became the first warship lost by the Royal Navy in the Second World War when she was [[torpedo]]ed in September 1939 by a German [[U-boat|submarine]]. ''Glorious'' participated in the [[Norwegian campaign]] in 1940, but she was sunk by two German [[battleship]]s in June as she sailed home with a minimal escort. ''Furious'' participated in many major operations during the war, including the Norwegian campaign in 1940, the [[Malta Convoys]] and ''[[Operation Torch]]'' in 1942, and airstrikes on the {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz}} and other targets in Norway in 1944. The ship was worn out by 1944 and was placed in [[Reserve fleet|reserve]] status in September 1944 before being [[Ship commissioning#Ship decommissioning|paid off]] in 1945 and sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] in 1948.\n\n== Careers as battlecruisers ==\n{{Main|Courageous-class battlecruiser}}\n\n[[File:HMS Glorious (1917) profile drawing.png|thumb|left|''Glorious'' as a battlecruiser]]\nThe first two ships of the class, ''Courageous'' and ''Glorious'', spent the First World War on [[North Sea]] patrols, climaxing in the [[Second Battle of Heligoland Bight]] in November 1917. Their half-sister ''Furious'' was designed with a pair of {{convert|18|in|0|adj=on}} guns\u2014as opposed to four {{convert|15|in|0|adj=on}}\u2014but was modified while being built to hold a flying-off deck and [[hangar]] in lieu of her forward [[gun turret|turret]] and [[barbette]]. She made some patrols in the North Sea before her rear turret was removed and another flight deck added. Her aircraft attacked [[Zeppelin]] sheds during the [[Tondern raid]] in July 1918.<ref>Roberts, p. 123</ref>\n\nAll three ships were reduced to reserve after the war. The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 limited the signatory nations to a set amount of capital ship tonnage; all ships in excess of this figure had to be scrapped. Up to {{convert|66000|LT|t|lk=on}} of existing ships could be converted into aircraft carriers, and the Royal Navy decided to use the ''Courageous''-class ships due to their high speed. Each ship was reconstructed with a flight deck during the 1920s.<ref>Friedman, p. 97</ref>\n\n== Conversions ==\n[[File:HMS Furious-2.jpg|thumb|left|''Furious'' as she was during the First World War with separate take-off and landing decks and superstructure in between]]\n[[File:Dunning Landing-on Furious In Pup.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Sopwith Pup]] unsuccessfully attempting to land on ''Furious''{{'}}s forward flight deck, 7 August 1917]]\n{{HMS|Furious|47|2}} had been fitted during the First World War with a flying-off and landing deck, but the latter proved largely unusable because of the strong air currents around the superstructure and exhaust gases from the funnel. She was laid up after the war, but was converted to an aircraft carrier between June 1921 and September 1925. Her design was based on the very limited experience gained with the first two British carriers: {{HMS|Argus|I49|2}}, less than three years old, and {{HMS|Eagle|1918|2}}, which had carried out only 143 deck landings during preliminary [[sea trial]]s in 1920.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 263\u2013267</ref><ref>Burt 2012, p. 252</ref><ref>Brown, p. 252</ref>\n\n''Furious''{{'}}s superstructure, masts, funnel and landing deck were removed and she was given a {{convert|576|by|92|ft|m|1|adj=on}} flight deck that extended over three-quarters of her length. This flight deck was not level; it sloped upwards about three-quarters of the way from the stern to help slow down landing aircraft, which had no brakes at the time it was designed. That era's fore-and-aft [[arresting gear]], initially {{convert|320|ft|1}} long on ''Furious'', was not intended to stop landing aircraft\u2014the landing speeds of the time were low enough that this was unnecessary given a good headwind\u2014but rather to prevent aircraft from veering off to one side and potentially falling off the flight deck. Various designs for the flight deck were tested in a wind tunnel by the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] which showed that the distinctive elliptical shape and rounded edges minimised turbulence. To minimise any turbulence over the flight deck, ''Furious'' was flush-decked and lacked an island, like ''Argus''; instead she was provided with a retractable [[Glossary of nautical terms#C|charthouse]] at the forward end of the flight deck.<ref>Friedman, pp. 93\u201395</ref>\n\nA two-[[storey]] hangar was built under the flight deck, each level being {{convert|15|ft|1|abbr=on}} high. The lower hangar was {{convert|550|ft|1|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|35|-|50|ft|1|abbr=on}} wide and the upper was {{convert|520|by|50|ft|1|abbr=on}}. Each hangar could be sectioned off by electrically operated steel shutters on rollers. Her boilers were ducted down the side of the ship to exhaust either out of gratings at the rear of the flight deck, or, when landing operations were in progress, out of the side of the lower hangar at the rear of the ship. This solution proved to be very unsatisfactory as it consumed valuable space, made parts of the lower hangar unbearable and interfered with landing operations to a greater or lesser degree. Her original flying-off deck remained in place for use by small aircraft like [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] so that the ship could simultaneously land aircraft on the main flight deck while fighters were taking off on the lower deck and could speedily launch her aircraft from both decks. Doors at the forward end of the upper hangar opened onto the lower flying deck.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 264\u2013265</ref> Two {{convert|47|by|46|ft|m|adj=on|1}} lifts (elevators) were installed to transfer aircraft between the flight deck and hangars. Two {{convert|600|impgal|l USgal|adj=on}} ready-use [[petrol]] tanks were provided for aircraft and the ship's boats on the upper deck. An additional {{convert|20000|impgal|l USgal}} of petrol were in bulk storage. The longitudinal arresting gear proved unpopular in service and it was ordered removed in 1927 after tests aboard ''Furious'' in 1926 had shown that deck-edge palisades were effective in reducing cross-deck gusts that could blow aircraft over the side.<ref>Friedman, pp. 94\u201395</ref> ''Furious''{{'}}s long exhaust ducting hampered landing operations, and restricted the size of the hangars and thus the number of aircraft that she could carry.<ref name=\"Friedmanpp\">Friedman, pp. 103, 105\u2013106</ref>\n\n''Glorious'' and ''Courageous'' were converted to aircraft carriers after ''Furious'' began her reconstruction, ''Courageous'' at [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport]] starting on 29 June 1924, and ''Glorious'' at [[Rosyth]] on 14 February 1924. The latter was moved to Devonport to complete the conversion after ''Furious'' was finished. Their design was based on ''Furious'' with a few improvements based on experience gained since she was designed. All superstructure, guns, and fittings down to the main deck were removed. A two-storey hangar, each level {{convert|16|ft|1|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|550|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} long, was built on top of the remaining hull; the upper hangar level opened onto a short flying-off deck, below and forward of the main flight deck. Two slightly larger {{convert|46|by|48|ft|m|adj=on|1}} lifts were installed fore and aft in the flight deck. An island was added on the starboard side with the bridge, flying control station, and funnel, as an island did not create as much turbulence as had been earlier feared. By 1939 both ships could carry {{convert|34500|impgal|l USgal}} of petrol.<ref name=\"Friedmanpp\" />\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:HMS Glorious underway 1936.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of ''Glorious'', 1936]]\nThe ''Courageous''-class ships had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|786|ft|9|in|m|1|abbr=on}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|90|ft|6|in|m|1|abbr=on}}, and a [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|28|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} at [[deep load]].

The Mark XVI gun fired  fifteen to twenty {{convert|35|lb|kg|adj=on}} HE shells per minute at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2660|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. Against surface targets it had a range of {{convert|19850|yd|m|abbr=on}} and a maximum ceiling of {{convert|31000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, but an effective anti-aircraft range of much less.<ref>Campbell, p. 56</ref> Two more Mark V 2-pounder mounts were added fore and aft of the newly added island at the same time.<ref name=b69 />\n\nDuring the Second World War, ''Furious'', the only surviving ship of the three, received an eventual total of 22 manually operated automatic [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|20&nbsp;mm Oerlikon]] light anti-aircraft (AA) guns, which replaced the single quadruple Vickers 0.50-calibre machine gun mount.<ref name=f9 /> The Oerlikon fired a {{convert|0.272|lb|adj=on}} HE shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2750|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. The maximum ceiling was 10,000 ft and the maximum range was {{convert|4800|yd|abbr=on}} although the effective range was under {{convert|1000|yd|abbr=on}}. The cyclic rate of fire was 450 rounds per minute, but the practical rate was between 250 and 320 rounds per minute owing to the need to reload [[magazine (firearms)|magazines]].<ref>Campbell, pp. 75\u201376</ref>\n\nA mix of single-purpose anti-surface and anti-aircraft guns in various sizes was considered for ''Courageous'' and ''Glorious'' by the [[Admiralty]], but was ultimately rejected for a dual-purpose armament of sixteen [[QF 4.7 inch Mk VIII naval gun|QF 4.7-inch Mark VIII]] guns in single high-angle mounts. One mount was on each side of the lower flight deck and a pair were on the quarterdeck. The remaining twelve mounts were distributed along the sides of each ship.<ref name=b83 /> These mounts could depress to \u22125\u00b0 and elevate to a maximum of 90\u00b0. The Mark VIII guns fired a {{convert|50|lb|kg|adj=on}} HE shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2457|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} at a rate of 8\u201312 rounds per minute. The guns had a maximum ceiling of {{convert|32000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, but an effective range of much less. They had a maximum range of {{convert|16160|yd|m|abbr=on}} against surface targets.<ref>Campbell, p. 51</ref>\n\nDuring refits in the mid-1930s, both ships received multiple 2-pounder ''pom-pom'' mounts. ''Courageous'' received three quadruple Mark VII mounts, one on each side of the flying-off deck, forward of the 4.7-inch guns, and one behind the island on the flight deck (two of these were transferred from the battleship {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|05|2}}). ''Glorious'' received three octuple Mark VI mounts in the same locations. Both ships received four water-cooled [[Vickers .50 machine gun|0.50-calibre Mark III]] [[machine gun]]s in a single quadruple mounting.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 157, 286</ref> This mount could depress to \u221210\u00b0 and elevate to a maximum of 70\u00b0. The machine guns fired a {{convert|1.326|oz|adj=on}} bullet at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2520|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. This gave the gun a maximum range of about {{convert|5000|yd|m|abbr=on}}, although its effective range was only {{convert|800|yd|m|abbr=on}}.<ref>Campbell, p. 78</ref> Neither ship had any further guns added before they were sunk early in the war,<ref name=f9 /> in 1939 and 1940, respectively.\n\n=== Fire control and radar ===\nTo assist its weapon systems in hitting their target, ''Furious'' was completed with one [[fire-control system]] for each side, with separate [[Fire-control system#Naval fire control|directors]] for low-angle and high-angle guns. The 5.5-inch guns were centrally controlled by a [[Frederic Charles Dreyer#Dreyer Fire Control Table|Dreyer Fire-Control Table]] on the lower deck while the 4-inch guns had their mechanical computers next to their directors.<ref name=f5 /> The existing fire-control directors were removed when ''Furious'' received her new dual-purpose 4-inch mountings in 1939. New high-angle directors, including two for the ''pom-poms'', were mounted on top of the new island and on the former lower flight deck. Over the course of the war [[Type 285 radar|Type 285]] gunnery [[radar]]s were mounted on top of the high-angle directors. She also received a [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 290|Type 290]] air-search radar.<ref name=f9 />\n\n''Courageous'' was initially fitted only with low-angle directors for her guns, but these were replaced by dual-purpose directors when she was refitted in 1930. (''Glorious'', completed later, had hers from the beginning.) Neither ship was fitted with radar before its early loss.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 285\u201386</ref>\n\n=== Protection ===\nLittle armour other than that of the [[barbette]]s was removed during their conversion to aircraft carriers. The transverse bulkheads were carried through the locations of the former barbettes. The flight deck was {{convert|0.625|in|mm}} in thickness.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 273, 282</ref>\n\nUnlike other British battlecruisers, the bulk of the armour of the ''Courageous''-class ships was made from [[Ultimate tensile strength|high-tensile]] steel (HTS), a type of steel used structurally in other ships. Their waterline [[Belt armor|belt]] consisted of {{convert|2|in|0}} of HTS covered by a {{convert|1|in|0|adj=on}} thick mild steel skin. It protected roughly the middle two-thirds of the ship with a one-inch extension forward to the two-inch forward transverse [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]] well short of the bow. The belt had a height of {{convert|23|ft|m|0}}, of which {{convert|18|in|m|1}} was below the designed waterline. From the former forward barbette, a 3-inch bulkhead extended out to the ship's side between the upper and lower decks and a comparable bulkhead was in place at the former location of the rear barbette as well. Four decks were armoured with thicknesses varying from {{convert|0.75|\u2013|3|in}}, thickest over the magazines and the steering gear. After the [[Battle of Jutland]], {{convert|110|LT|t}} of extra protection was added to the deck around the magazines.<ref>Burt 1986, pp. 308, 313</ref>\n\nThe [[torpedo bulkhead]]s were increased during building from 0.75\u2013{{convert|1.5|in|abbr=on}} in thickness.<ref>Roberts, pp. 54, 106, 113</ref> All three ships were fitted with a shallow [[anti-torpedo bulge]] integral to the hull, which was intended to detonate the torpedo before it hit the hull proper and deflect the underwater explosion to the surface, away from the ship. Later testing proved that it was not deep enough to accomplish its task and that it lacked the layers of empty and full compartments that were necessary to absorb the force of the explosion.<ref>Roberts, p. 111</ref>\n\n=== Air groups ===\n[[File:HMS Furious-15.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Furious'' in the mid-1930s with a flight of [[Blackburn Baffin]] torpedo bombers overhead]]\nNormally, ''Furious'' could carry only about 36 aircraft. In the 1920s this commonly meant one flight (squadrons after 1932) of fighters ([[Fairey Flycatcher]]), two of spotters ([[Blackburn Blackburn]] or [[Avro Bison]]), one spotter reconnaissance ([[Fairey III]]D) and two flights of torpedo bombers ([[Blackburn Dart]]). In 1935 there was one squadron of fighters with [[Hawker Nimrod]]s and [[Hawker Osprey]]s, one squadron of [[Blackburn Baffin]] torpedo bombers and one squadron of Fairey IIIF spotters. During the Second World War, the carrier typically carried a single fighter squadron and two of strike aircraft of various types, although the mix was often adjusted for specific missions.<ref name=b69 />\n\n''Courageous'' and ''Glorious'' were generally similar except that they carried a total of 48 aircraft. They commonly flew the same types of aircraft as ''Furious'', although they are also known to have flown the [[Fairey Seal]], the [[Blackburn Shark]], and the [[Blackburn Ripon]].<ref>Burt 2012, p. 284</ref>\n\n== Pre-war service ==\n''Furious'' was assigned to the [[Atlantic Fleet (United Kingdom)|Atlantic Fleet]] after commissioning in 1925, although she spent much of the next several years conducting trials for practically every aircraft in the [[Fleet Air Arm]] (FAA) inventory. These included landing and flying-off tests of Fairey IIID and Fairey Flycatcher [[floatplane]]s, with and without wheels, to compare various designs of wooden and metal floats. The lower flight deck was greased to allow them to take off with a minimum of difficulty. A Flycatcher fitted with wooden skids was also tested and behaved perfectly satisfactorily.<ref name=f9 /><ref>Burt 2012, pp. 270\u2013272</ref> The arresting gear was barely used during these trials and it was removed shortly afterwards. Deck-edge [[palisade]]s ([[windbreak]]s) were installed in 1927 to keep aircraft from blowing over the side in rough weather.<ref name=f5 /><ref>Jenkins, p. 271</ref> The first carrier night-landing was made by a Blackburn Dart on 6 May 1926 aboard ''Furious''.<ref>Jenkins, p. 274</ref>\n\nThe ship was reduced to reserve status on 1 July 1930 in preparation for a lengthy overhaul at Devonport from September 1930 to February 1932, focused on refitting her machinery and re-tubing her boilers.<ref name=b0>Burt 2012, p. 270</ref> In addition her quarterdeck was raised by one deck, the AA armament was revised and water spraying facilities were fitted in the hangars.<ref>Jenkins, pp. 275\u2013276</ref> Upon completion she ran a full-power trial on 16 February 1932 where her maximum speed was {{convert|28.8|kn|abbr=on}} from a total of {{convert|89754|shp|abbr=on}}.<ref name=b0 />\n\n''Furious'' was recommissioned in May 1932 as part of the Home Fleet with a reduced crew before being brought up to full complement in November.<ref name=j6>Jenkins, p. 276</ref> Transverse arresting gear was fitted sometime during the mid-1930s. She was detached to the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] from May to October 1934. ''Furious'' was present at the Coronation [[Fleet Review]] at [[Spithead]] on 20 May 1937 for King [[George VI]]. She became a deck-landing training carrier in 1937, although she was refitted between December 1937 and May 1938 in Devonport, where the forward end of her lower flight deck was raised to make her less wet forward. During the [[Munich Crisis]] in September 1938, she embarked Nos. [[801 Naval Air Squadron|801]], [[821 Naval Air Squadron|821]] and [[822 Naval Air Squadron|822 Squadrons]] and joined the fleet at [[Scapa Flow]], before resuming her training duties after the peaceful conclusion of the affair.<ref name=\"b69\" /><ref name=j6 />\n\nShe was given a more extensive refit from January to May 1939 that removed her 5.5-inch guns and palisades, mounted AA guns on her flying-off deck, plated in the doors at the forward end of the upper hangar, and gave her a small island on the starboard side. ''Furious'' resumed her training duties after the completion of the refit and continued them until October 1939.<ref>Jenkins, pp. 277\u2013278</ref>\n\n[[File:HMS Courageous (50).jpg|thumb|left|''Courageous'' at anchor ({{circa|1935}})]]\n''Courageous'' was recommissioned on 21 February 1928 and assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet from May 1928 to June 1930. She was relieved by ''Glorious'' and refitted from June to August 1930. The ship was assigned to the Atlantic and Home Fleets from 12 August 1930 to December 1938 aside from a temporary attachment to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1936. In the early 1930s, transverse arresting gear was installed and she received two hydraulic [[aircraft catapult|catapults]] on the upper flight deck before March 1934. ''Courageous'' was refitted again between October 1935 and June 1936 and received her ''pom-pom'' mounts. She was also present at the 1937 Coronation Fleet Review. She became a training carrier in December 1938 when {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|2}} joined the Home Fleet and continued on that duty until the start of the Second World War.<ref name=b15>Burt 2012, pp. 285\u2013286, 290</ref>\n\n[[File:HMS Glorious anchored.jpg|thumb|right|''Glorious'' at anchor (circa 1934)]]\n''Glorious'' was recommissioned on 24 February 1930 for service with the Mediterranean Fleet, but was attached to the Home Fleet from March to June 1930. She relieved ''Courageous'' in the Mediterranean Fleet in June 1930 and remained there until October 1939. In a fog on 1 April 1931 ''Glorious'' rammed SS ''Florida'' amidships while steaming at {{convert|16|knots|abbr=on}}. The impact crumpled {{convert|60|ft|1|abbr=on}} of the flying-off deck and forced ''Glorious'' to put into [[Gibdock|Gibraltar]] for temporary repairs. She had to sail to [[Malta Dockyard|Malta]] for permanent repairs which lasted until September 1931. Sometime in the early 1930s, transverse arresting gear was installed. She was refitted at Devonport from July 1934 to July 1935 where she received two catapults, her flight deck was extended to the rear, her quarterdeck was raised one deck and she received her multiple ''pom-pom'' mounts. ''Glorious'' also participated in the 1937 Coronation Fleet Review before returning to the Mediterranean.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 285\u2013288</ref>\n\n== Second World War ==\n=== ''Courageous'' ===\n[[File:HMS Courageous sinking.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Courageous'' sinking]]\nIn the early days of the war, [[Hunter-killer Group|hunter-killer groups]] were formed around the fleet aircraft carriers to find and destroy U-boats. On 17 September 1939, two torpedoes from {{GS|U-29|1936|2}} turned the tables, and ''Courageous'' became the first British warship sunk in the Second World War. As ''Ark Royal'' had been surprised by a near-miss seven days earlier, the fleet carriers were withdrawn from this duty.<ref>Rohwer, pp. 1\u20133</ref>\n\n=== ''Glorious'' ===\nForce J, including ''Glorious'', was organised to hunt for the {{ship|German pocket battleship|Admiral Graf Spee}} in the Indian Ocean. They were not successful, and ''Glorious'' remained in the Indian Ocean until December when she was transferred to the Mediterranean.\n\n''Glorious'' was recalled to the Home Fleet in April 1940 to provide air cover for British forces landing in [[Norwegian Campaign|Norway]].<ref>Burt 2012, p. 285</ref> [[Gloster Gladiators]] of [[No. 263 Squadron RAF]] were flown aboard to be transferred to Norwegian airbases. ''Glorious'' and ''Ark Royal'' arrived off central Norway on 24 April where 263 Squadron was flown off and their organic aircraft attacked targets in the [[Trondheim]] area before ''Glorious'' had to return to Scapa Flow on 27 April to refuel and embark new aircraft. She returned on 1 May, after failing to load new aircraft because of poor weather. The task force was under heavy air attack by the [[Luftwaffe]] all day and was withdrawn that evening.<ref>Haarr, pp. 143\u2013154</ref>\n\n''Glorious'' returned on 18 May with six [[Supermarine Walrus]] [[Amphibious aircraft|amphibious]] [[flying boat]]s of [[701 Naval Air Squadron|701 Squadron]] and 18 [[Hawker Hurricane]]s of [[No. 46 Squadron RAF]]. The Walruses were flown off to [[Harstad]], but the airfield at [[Sk\u00e5nland]] was not yet ready for the Hurricanes and they were still aboard when ''Glorious'' returned to Scapa on 21 May. ''Glorious'' came back to the [[Narvik]] area on 26 May and the Hurricanes were flown off.<ref>Haarr, pp. 261\u2013262</ref>\n\nBritish forces were ordered withdrawn a few days later. The evacuation (''[[Operation Alphabet]]'') began in the north on the night of 3/4 June, and ''Glorious'' arrived off the coast on 2 June to provide support. She carried only nine Sea Gladiators of [[802 Naval Air Squadron|802 Squadron]] and six Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers of [[823 Naval Air Squadron|823 Squadron]] for self-defence, as it was hoped to evacuate the RAF fighters if possible. Ten Gladiators of 263 Squadron were flown aboard during the afternoon of 7 June and the Hurricanes of 46 Squadron were also flown aboard without any significant problems in the early evening despite having a much higher landing speed than the biplanes.<ref>Haarr, pp. 308\u2013310</ref> This was the first time that high performance monoplanes without [[tailhook]]s had been landed on an aircraft carrier.<ref name=h61>Howland, p. 61</ref>\n\nCaptain [[Guy D'Oyly-Hughes]] requested and was granted permission to proceed independently to Scapa Flow in the early hours of 8 June. On the way back across the [[North Sea]], ''Glorious'' and her two escorting destroyers, {{HMS|Acasta|H09|2}} and {{HMS|Ardent|H41|2}}, were found by the two German battleships {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}}.<ref>Haarr, pp. 329\u2013330</ref> No [[combat air patrol]] was being flown, no aircraft were spotted on the deck for quick take off and there was no lookout in the [[crow's nest]].<ref>Howland, p. 52</ref> The German heavy ships sank all three British vessels with most of their crews, although ''Acasta'' managed to torpedo ''Scharnhorst'' before she was sunk. Only 43 men from ''Glorious'' survived.<ref>Rohwer, p. 26</ref>\n\n=== ''Furious'' ===\nUntil 2 October 1939, ''Furious'' remained on training duties, combined with anti-submarine sweeps off the east coast of Scotland.<ref>Jenkins, p. 277</ref> She was then assigned to the Home Fleet to replace the sunken ''Courageous'' and sortied on 8 October with the fleet to hunt unsuccessfully for the ''Gneisenau'' and escorting ships which had been spotted off southern Norway. ''Furious'' departed her berth adjacent to the battleship {{HMS|Royal Oak|08|2}} in Scapa Flow for more futile searches for German ships on 13 October, the day before ''Royal Oak'' was sunk by {{GS|U-47|1938|2}} in Scapa Flow. ''Furious'' served as the flagship for the convoy bringing most of the [[1st Canadian Infantry Division]] to Britain in mid-December 1939.<ref>Jenkins, p. 279</ref>\n\n''Furious'' joined the Home Fleet off the coast of Norway on 10 April 1940 and her Swordfish made several attacks on German ships in Narvik on the following days. She refuelled at [[Troms\u00f8]] on the 14th and remained behind after the bulk of the Home Fleet departed on 15 April, her aircraft flying reconnaissance missions until ordered home on 25 April. Her port inner turbine had been damaged by the shock wave from a near miss on 18 April, and the damage was more serious than initially thought. After quick repairs, ''Furious'' returned on 18 May carrying the Gladiators of a reformed 263 Squadron; they were flown off on 21 May once their base at [[Bardufoss Air Station|Bardufoss]] was ready. She sailed to Scapa Flow once all the Gladiators had been flown off.<ref>Haarr, pp. 139\u2013141, 261</ref>\n\nOn 14 June, carrying only half of [[816 Naval Air Squadron|816 Squadron]] for her own protection, ''Furious'' sailed unescorted for [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]] carrying \u00a318,000,000 in gold [[bullion]]. On 1 July she escorted a convoy of Canadian troops bound for [[Iceland]] from Halifax and ferried over almost 50 aircraft, spare parts and munitions. On his own initiative, Captain [[Thomas Hope Troubridge|Troubridge]] ordered all available space should be used for sugar bound for Britain. She reembarked her aircraft upon her arrival and made a number of air strikes on shipping in Norwegian waters and on the seaplane base at Troms\u00f8 through October 1940.<ref>Jenkins, p. 283</ref> ''Furious'' loaded 55 aircraft in [[Liverpool]] on 7 November and sailed for [[Takoradi]], [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]], on 15 November where the aircraft were flown off on 27 November to reinforce fighter units defending [[Desert Air Force|Egypt]]. By 15 December, ''Furious'' was back in Liverpool, where she embarked 40 Hurricanes for Takoradi. She sailed on 21 December and joined up with [[Convoy WS 5A]] which encountered the {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper||2|up=y}} on 25 December. The German ship was driven off by the escorts, and ''Furious'' reached Takoradi on 10 January 1941. She arrived in Britain on 5 February where she was given a brief refit. She made another ferry trip to Takoradi between 4 and 22 March.<ref>Nailer, pp. 154\u2013155</ref>\n\nNow with a new destination for her ferry trips, ''Furious'' transported two dozen Hurricanes to Gibraltar on 25 April where they were transferred to ''Ark Royal'' to be flown off for [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|Malta]]. She returned for another load of Hurricanes and arrived back in Gibraltar on 18 May. Some of these fighters were moved to ''Ark Royal'' via planks between the flight decks of the carriers berthed stern to stern. This time she accompanied ''Ark Royal'' and the two carriers flew off their fighters from a position south of Sardinia. She would repeat this ferry mission three more times from June to September 1941.<ref>Nailer, p. 165</ref> In July and August, ''Furious'' and {{HMS|Victorious|R38|2}} attacked German installations in the Arctic areas of Norway and Finland with limited success and heavy losses. Following her last ferry mission she was sent to [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, to refit.<ref>Jenkins, p. 284</ref>\n\n[[File:A Supermarine Seafire being brought up onto the flight deck of HMS FURIOUS, August 1944. A25076.jpg|thumb|A [[Supermarine Seafire]] being brought up onto the flight deck of ''Furious'', August 1944]]\n\n''Furious'' arrived back in the UK in April 1942 and spent the next three months [[Glossary of nautical terms#W|working up]]. In August she was detailed to accompany the convoy bound for Malta in [[Operation Pedestal]], but she was to sail with them only far enough to allow her 38 [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s to reach Malta. This she did, just as ''Eagle'' was torpedoed, but ''Furious'' turned around after flying off her fighters and reached Gibraltar successfully. She loaded another batch of 32 Spitfires on 16 August and they were flown off the following day south-east of the [[Balearic Islands]]. After this mission ''Furious'' was sent back to Home Fleet for training. One last mission was necessary to reinforce the defences of Malta before [[Operation Torch]], and she arrived on 27 October. She loaded 32 Spitfires and launched them on the 29th before returning to Gibraltar to participate in Torch.<ref>Nailer, pp. 164\u2013165</ref>\n\nProviding cover for the Central Task Force, ''Furious''{{'}}s aircraft neutralised the airfields at [[Es S\u00e9nia|La Senia]] and [[Tafraoui]], both near [[Oran]], Algeria. She remained with Force H until February 1943 before transferring to Home Fleet where she remained for the rest of the war. In July the Home Fleet demonstrated off the coast of Norway in strength to distract attention from the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]]; ''Furious''{{'}}s role was to allow a German reconnaissance aircraft to spot the British ships and make a report then shoot it down.<ref>Jenkins, pp. 284\u2013285</ref> She was refitted in August and spent the rest of the year training.<ref name=b2>Burt 2012, p. 277</ref>\n\nOn 3 April 1944, [[Fairey Barracuda]]s from ''Furious'' and ''Victorious'' attacked the German battleship ''Tirpitz'' in [[Altafjord]], Norway, as part of [[Operation Tungsten]]. ''Tirpitz'' was hit 14 times and needed three months to complete her repairs, although four aircraft were lost in the attack. The Home Fleet tried another attack on ''Tirpitz'' later in the month, but bad weather prevented any attack from being made. Instead the aircraft attempted to attack installations at [[Bod\u00f8]], but found a German convoy instead and sank three ships. Three operations against targets in northern Norway, including two against ''Tirpitz'', had to be abandoned or diverted to other targets in May, but three German ships were sunk and two more were set afire. ''Furious'' and other carriers made another attempt to sink the ''Tirpitz'' on 17 July, but were unsuccessful against the fully alerted German defences. Four more attacks on ''Tirpitz'' were made in August, but only the attack on the 24th was even partially successful as two minor hits were made.<ref>Rohwer, pp. 314, 320, 322, 343, 350\u2013351</ref>\n\nAs the war progressed, the ship's age and limitations became increasingly apparent, and ''Furious'' was placed in reserve on 15 September 1944. She was [[paid off]] in April 1945 and used to evaluate the effects of aircraft explosives on the ship's structure. She was sold in 1948 for scrap, which was completed in 1954 at [[Troon]].<ref name=b2 />\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book|last=Brown|first=David|title=HMS Eagle|series=Warship Profile|volume=35|year=1973|publisher=Profile Publications|location=Windsor, Berkshire, UK|oclc=33084560}}\n* {{cite book|last=Burt|first=R.

While the trains, tracks and scenery accessories are made mainly of wood, the engines and cars connect to each other using metal hooks or small [[magnet]]s, and some use plastic wheels mounted on metal axles. Some trains are made to resemble [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphical]], [[fictional]], and [[prototypical]] [[railroad]] equipment.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Early companies in the United States ===\nMarshal H. Larrabee II founded the [[Skaneateles Handicrafters]] in 1936. This toy company made wooden toy trains and wooden tracks.<ref>[http://www.tacny.org/technologist/issue0601.html Technology Club Newsletter from June 2001]</ref> The gauge was very similar to that used by most companies today. However, the connections for the track pieces were of a different design than the jigsaw style \"peg and hole\" system used today.<ref>[http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT2254153 US patent 2254153] from 1940 concerning Marshal H. Larrabee's Wooden Toy Train system</ref> The trains were made of [[maple]] and were often left unpainted and unstained.<ref>As is stated in this [https://books.google.com/books?id=s1QEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA31&lpg=PA31&dq=Skaneateles+Handicrafters&source=bl&ots=M0R2NOS7LB&sig=F_0Yu1JmpukAYErTkSyGIO4uRtU&hl=en&ei=iYHYSsL-GsqvsAaL1_3tBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAgQ6AEwADgo#v=onepage&q=Skaneateles%20Handicrafters&f=false advertisement] in the LIFE issue from 28. Nov. 1955.</ref> They are compatible with many brands of modern wooden train track. [[Playskool]] took over the sales for Skaneateles Handicrafters in 1956. This company retained the design and track connecting system into the 1960s.<ref>Set by [http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=253652 Skaneateles Handicrafters for Playskool] in the collection of the [[Powerhouse Museum]] in Sidney, Australia.</ref> Marshal H. Larrabee sold his company to the German-based [[Habermaa\u00df GmbH]] in 1980. The company was renamed T.C. Timber and its products were manufactured in [[Skaneateles (town), New York|Skaneateles]]. The production line was closed in 2002.<ref>[http://www.tacny.org/technologist/2002/issue0902.html Technology Club Newsletter from September 2002]</ref>\n\nThe Jack-Built Toy Manufacturing Company marketed its own range of wooden toy trains under the brand name \"Jack Built Snap Trains\" around 1956 to 1962. These were manufactured in Japan and used a snap system to join pieces of rolling stock and tracks. Rolling stock from Jack Built Snap Trains and [[Skaneateles Handicrafters]] could ride on either manufacturer's tracks. However, individual pieces of rolling stock and track from the two brands could not be combined. This is because the coupling systems for the tracks and trains were different.\n\nCalifornia-based Ben Orel filed U.S. patent #2847798<ref>[http://www.google.com/patents?id=tLdeAAAAEBAJ&dq=2847798 US patent 2939245] from 1960 concerning Ben Orel's Wooden Toy Train \"snap\" coupling system</ref> in 1956 and was granted the patent for his \"snap coupling\" system two years later.

This is similar to the idea that [[Learning Curve Brands|Learning Curve]] later used for their \"[[Thomas and Friends Wooden Railway|Thomas & Friends]]\" range. He also submitted a patent for magnetic couplings in 1958.<ref>[http://www.google.com/patents?id=50lsAAAAEBAJ&dq=2939245 US patent 2939245] granted 1960 concerning Ben Orel's Wooden Toy Train magnetic coupling system</ref> This patent was granted in 1960. It may have been the earliest attempt to use magnets with a wooden toy train system.

It apparently produced its first wooden train sets for a Swedish department store in 1956, thus predating Brio by a year or two.\n\nThere was a long tradition of [[Wooden toymaking in the Ore Mountains|wooden toy-making along the mountain forests surrounding Bohemia]]. [[Seiffen]] made wooden figures and Christmas decorations and Blumenau (today a part of [[Olbernhau]]) created building blocks and construction sets. Mass production techniques for polishing and coloring wooden toys were established and perfected in the Bohemian areas.<ref>[http://www.baukastensammler.de/technologie/trommelpolieren.html Description] of the production process at the [http://www.baukastensammler.de/ \"Construction Toy Collector\"] site of Joachim Kleindienst. English summary: Johann Schowanek of Georgental (Jiretin, part of Albrechtsdorf) in Bohemia, now within the Czech Republic, invented or perfected the process of polishing and coloring his wooden items in rotating drums starting with the production of wooden beads in 1908. He presented some of his toy products for the first time at the Leipzig Trade Fair in 1927. The toy companies of the Seiffen and Blumenau regions among others showed great interest and soon started similar developments of their own.</ref> Some of the early sets exhibited train designs that were later used for wooden track trains. In 1949, Hermann [[Eichhorn]], of the Eichhorn family that made the PEWESTI wooden toys in [[Steinach, Thuringia]],<ref>[http://www.baukastensammler.de/hersteller/hersteller_eichhorn.html Origin] of Hermann Eichhorn with a list of literature on the [http://www.baukastensammler.de/ \"Construction Toy Collector\"] site of Joachim Kleindienst</ref> founded his company for wooden toys in the Bavarian town of [[Egglham]]. In 1961, he started producing his version of a wooden track railway system. Eichhorn claims that his company is the first to have systematically used the \"vario system\" for the connectors. Eichhorn applied for a U.S. patent<ref>[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5427561.html US Patent 5,427,561 from Jun.27,1995]</ref> for a \"battery powered toy train\" in 1994. In 1997 the company had to be sold to the [[Simba-Dickie-Group]], which moved production to [[Unho\u0161\u0165]], near Prague in the [[Czech Republic]].<ref>Short [http://www.toy-net.ch/de/nostheide/branchenbrief/5-99.htm note] on the destruction of the old factory and the move of production to the Czech Republic in \"Branchenbrief International - Spielzeugbranche aktuell\" #5 of March 12, 1999.</ref> By 1998 the company was fully integrated into the Simba-Dickie-Group.<ref>Company [http://www.simbatoys.de/en/about_us.shtml history page] on the Website of Simba-Dickie.</ref> In February 1999 two fires totally destroyed the old factory buildings in Egglham and consumed most of the company's archives and work models.<ref>Article in the PNP (Passauer Neue Presse) on tuesday February 16th 1999, \"Lokalteil Pfarrkirchen, Gro\u00dfbrand bei der Firma Eichhorn\" by Ronald Sterr (\"Regional News of Pfarrkirchen, Large Fire at the Eichhorn Company\").</ref>\n\nHeros (He+ros), the company of Hermann Rossberg of [[Lam, Germany|Lam]] in the [[Bavarian Forest]] near to the border of Bohemia, influenced train design in the Blumenau tradition.<ref>[http://www.baukastensammler.de/sammlung/werbung/holzbaukasten/ereuter/fairycastlemain.html Advertising Sheet] from ca. 1935 from the company Baukastenfabrik E.

The train lines where dropped and the focus shifted to wooden toy blocks and the constructor toy range while Eichhorn became the only supplier of toy trains on a wooden track system within the Simba-Dickie-Group.\n\n===The 1990s, new companies and new ideas===\n\n\"[[Thomas the Tank Engine]]\" is a character created by the [[W.V. Awdry|Rev. W. Awdry]] in ''[[The Railway Series]]'' of children's books, first published in the U.K. in 1945. In 1984 a television series called ''[[Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends]]'' was made, adding to the popularity of the characters. It was first broadcast in the United States in 1989. John W. Lee founded the company \"[[Learning Curve Brands|Learning Curve Toys]]\" in November 1992 with a wooden railway system called \"[[Thomas and Friends Wooden Railway|Thomas & Friends]]\" based on the Thomas the Tank Engine characters. This made the wooden toy trains even more popular than before. Learning Curve introduced some new designs for the track surface, such as the \"Clickety Clack\" rails patented 1995<ref>[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5454513.html US Patent 5,454,513 from Oct.3,1995]</ref> and the newer tracks in 2002<ref>[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6648237.html US Patent 6,648,237 B2 from Nov.18,2003]</ref> with a relief to supply better traction grip for battery powered four wheel drive trains patented in 1998.<ref>[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6089952.html US Patent 6089952 filed on Jan.28,1998]</ref> The ''Thomas'' brand of wooden trains continues to this day under the branding of ''Thomas and Friends Wood'' and are released by [[Mattel|Mattel\u2019s]] ''[[Fisher-Price]]'' subdivision.\n\nWith the popularity of the toy system rising due to the success of ''Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends'', new markets outside of the traditional groups and countries were opened. While companies such as Mapple Landmark adjusted its existing line of \"Name Trains\" to the gauge of the vario system in 1993, others such as [[Whittle Shortline]], established in 1997, started producing rolling stock based on the more realistic designs of existing American examples.<ref>This led to longer rolling stock with an own new bogie design, as [http://www.google.com/patents?id=lDYKAAAAEBAJ shown in a patent] granted to Michael W. Whitworth of Whittle Shortline in 2002.</ref> While Brio and ''Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends'' clearly favoured the steam engine era, Whittle Shortline expanded into heavy duty diesel engines of designs hardly known in Europe. In the product line \"Trains of the World\" shown in the Brio catalog of 1998, Brio presents several historic steam engines, such as the [[LNER Class A4 4468 Mallard|Mallard]] or the [[LNER Class A3 4472 Flying Scotsman|Flying Scotsman]] along with several modern high speed trains such as the [[Shinkansen]], [[TGV]] or [[Intercity-Express|ICE]]. The only diesel unit is from the Santa Fe line. \n\nOther companies, such as Nilo and KidKraft, concentrated on related items like train tables, among other products. Suretrack sells its track securing clips, and Choo Choo Track & Toy Co., founded in 1999, has concentrated on producing and designing tracks and accessories.\n\n====Subway & Commuter Rail Systems====\nA recent sub-genre has emerged based on real-life prototypes of subway and commuter rail rolling stock. One example is the \"New York City Subway Wooden Railway\" by the company named \"Munipals\" which sells units in each of the NYC subway lines colors & markings. They have recently expanded to commuter rail line rolling stock for New Jersey, Metro North, LIRR, and Philadelphia. The Washington DC Metro store sells rolling stock in each of the DC Metro line markings; as does the web store of the Boston T. The London Underground museum store sells rolling stock in the colors of each of the London Underground Lines. Whittle Shortline sells commuter rail line rolling stock for the California and the Chicago transit systems; Bauer & Sohn has rolling stock for Berlin, Munich, and Nuremberg; Lalok, rolling stock for Vienna subway and tram. Perhaps the Tokyo, Moscow, and other international subway systems will follow suit.\n\n===Electronics and Asian Production Sites===\n\n====Electronics====\nAlthough the original push-along trains made mostly of wood still resemble the core idea of this system toy and as of 2006 form the base of all the involved companies' production lines, electronics have gained access to the wooden world. After introducing battery powered engines in the 1990s, remote control had been added by 2002, and so-called smart tracks introduced plastic parts to the wooden track pieces. In 2006 Brio even introduced a theme resembling electronic networking with some electronic gadgets. Altogether this has led to some new track designs allowing better traction for the self powered trains or means of communication between the tracks and trains using some magnetic or electronic gadget.\n\n====Asian production====\nAs with other toys, many wooden trains and track have been manufactured in China and other Asian countries in the twenty-first century. The lead paint problems of 2007<ref>[http://recalls.rc2.com/recalls_Wood_0607.html Lead paint recall of June 13th, 2007, by RC2 Corporation]</ref> brought this to public awareness. Manufacturing in Asia goes back a lot further though: already in the 1950s the Snap-Trains of Ben Orel were made in Japan.\n\nProbably the first major brand that was manufactured in China was the Chicago-based \"Thomas and Friends Wooden Railway\". Some of the design, such as the character faces and the spoked wheels, have stayed unique to the brand while other attributes, such as the modular build of the units with a rectangular single block chassis holding the wheels and individual buildup on top, have become widespread designs in China and elsewhere. Another major brand is Maxim. Starting with traditional rather plain and abstract designs, Maxim sold products under the name \"Tumble Tree Wood\" for retail stores. They have since adopted their current design with a winged number on their rolling stock. The main supplier is a factory in [[Dongguan|Dong Guan]], China. The trains with the winged numbers are also sold by other brands such as Babalu in Germany. In 2004,<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/18/business/worldbusiness/18toys.html?pagewanted=print New York Times article of September 18, 2007]</ref> Brio of Sweden moved most of their production to three factories in [[Guangdong]] Province, China. A more recent brand is Melissa & Doug that is also produced in China. Smaller projects were the short-lived ventures of Remus and Europlay.\n\nA producer that has sold its products under very many brands including its own name is Mentari Massen, with its main factory founded in 1988 in [[Surabaya]], Indonesia. Their items have been sold as sets or individually bundled under such brand names as elile, FunToys, Toytopia, The Toy Company, Bino, Snap on Tools and Bigjigs, as well as Mentari Toys or Mentari Group.\n\nA quite prolific producer with its own clear design is Plantoys of Thailand. They have been making children's toys and furniture from rubber wood, which has since been adopted by other companies. They have a range of car and city related sets that could be used as accessories for the wooden toy train ranges of other producers. They had a joint venture with Brio in 2001\u20132002,<ref>[http://www.playthings.com/article/CA225766.html?q=plan+toy Note] at the www.playthings.com site on the joint venture plans of Brio and Plan Toys from 2001.</ref> being present in the Brio catalogs of the time. By 2007 they had started their own line of wooden trains, expanding it in 2008.\n\nIn 1985, Bigjigs Toys Ltd started out by selling a large range of wooden jigsaws. Then in the 1990s they moved into the wooden railway market with a small core range of wooden railway system items. In 2007 they re-launched their railway range under the brand Bigjigs Rail, in new blue sky and green hills packaging. There are, as of 2012, over 130 pieces in the Bigjigs Rail range including sets, track and a range of real life engines such as Mallard, Duchess of Hamilton and Bluebell.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n==The track system==\nAlthough the products of many companies are quite compatible with each other they may vary in make, the wood used and some basic measurements. Popular woods used and advertised thus are [[beech]], [[maple]] and [[rubber tree]].\n\n=== The gauge ===\n[[Image:Woodtrackprofil.png|right|thumb|Profiles of wooden tracks for toy trains]]\nTrack grooves are 3&nbsp;mm deep, 6&nbsp;mm wide and have 20&nbsp;mm between them (26 mm center to center). The tracks themselves are 40&nbsp;mm wide and 12&nbsp;mm high. To be kept on track the system can be reduced to a shallow groove 30&nbsp;mm wide, as in some road systems or small ramps that allow the vehicle to get on or off the track from the floor, or to a middle section 20&nbsp;mm wide and 3&nbsp;mm high, as in some beginners tracks or double track road systems. Most modern track systems have a somewhat sophisticated profile with varying degrees of slanted sides for the grooves or rounded edges. In the imperial system the tracks have been described as having grooves an eighth of an inch deep, a quarter of an inch wide and with three quarters of an inch between them. The tracks themselves are one and a half inches wide and half an inch high.<ref>[http://pw1.netcom.com/~thoog/hnr/hnr.html Todd Hoogerland on the Gauge Standards]</ref> However, unlike other model railroading gauges, which have been formally defined by enthusiast groups such as the [[National Model Railroad Association]] or the [[Normen Europ\u00e4ischer Modellbahnen]], there is no agreed gauge for wooden trains. The actual cross sectional profile of any given manufacturer's track is usually patented, compelling new manufacturers to alter their track design enough to allow compatibility with other brands without committing patent infringement.\n\n===Flipping track pieces===\nSome track pieces such as curves and points have grooves on both sides so that they can be used from both sides. By flipping the piece around one can convert a left-hand curve or point to a right-handed one. Another possibility is to have the two grooves for trains on the one side and the single wide groove for roads on the other side. Ben Orel describes such a system in U.S. patent #3013726,<ref name=\"Orel-1961\" /> which he submitted in 1960. Learning Curve made such tracks for their \"Thomas the Tank Engine\" theme.\n\n===The Vario system===\nWhen trying to document a layout with exact geometry one quickly notices that a lot of layouts one builds with real track do not work using a CAD system or some track layout program.<ref>[http://www.woodenrailway.info/track/trackmath.html John Mechalas on track layout geometry with the Vario System.]</ref> This is due to the so-called \"vario system\" which allows some play when joining the tracks, so that with some wiggling around one can make layouts line up perfectly with no danger of derailing trains which do not use the exact geometry of the pieces. This is achieved by making the pegs somewhat smaller than the holes. Sometimes the round part of the hole is not an exact circle but rather an ellipse, allowing the tracks to connect with a small gap between them. Also, the neck gap does not have a sharp edge at the end of the track, but is carved round. This may have started as a production loss or to make it easier for small children to join the tracks. Some sources{{who|date=July 2012}} state that Eichhorn was the first to design connections using this system.\n\n===Some track and layout geometry===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nThough not all manufacturers use the same system for their track piece designs some principle standards have evolved, as the geometry involved with track systems tends to pose the same problems to everyone. The first question may be how to divide the circle. The standard for wooden tracks is eight pieces. The next important length is the diameter of the circle made of a line along the center of the tracks. This length is useful for figures such as an eight with the crossing at right angles, a simple L-figure, a bulge to one side or a spectacles or Mickey Mouse head, to name the simplest.\n\nA division in two gives a handy piece of straight track. For the figure eight one could use two straight pieces to go underneath and a bridge made to the same length to cross over the other straights. If one wants a crossing on the same level, the diameter can be divided by three and a crossing piece made with straights of that length. Of course one can also produce pieces of a quarter diameter length to put to the left and right of a central bridge piece that is half the length of the diameter. As one can see, it is useful to determine the length of the straight tracks by dividing the diameter of the circle made by the curves. Brio uses lengths of half, quarter and eighth as well as a third and sixth.\n\nTo solve problems of offset produced by points that branch out at the same angle producing parallel tracks, it is also useful to design such points and switches so that one of the short straights can compensate the offset. An easy way to design points is by tracing a long and a curved track to the same piece using the same connecting point as the origin. Such a merged piece can thus serve as a curve for one branch and a straight for the other while using the same dimensions as the other pieces.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Figure8.png|\nImage:FigureL.png|\nImage:Figurebulge2.png|\nImage:Briodevisionsystem.png|\n</gallery>\n\n===Road systems===\nSeveral approaches have been made over time to add a road system to the railway tracks. The first and still most widely used level crossings use simple ramps that enable vehicles to cross the thick tracks from whatever underground the tracks are placed on. The simplest way to add roads to this existing solution is to provide a layout printed on a paper or plastic sheet or even a carpet that uses the dimensions of the wooden tracks. Some companies have made thin track pieces out of plastic or other materials that can be joined by some connecting system and have special crossover pieces to allow playing together with a wooden railway system. The next step seems to have been road track pieces of similar thickness as the railway tracks but using some other connecting design. Using the same \"peg and hole\" system as the railway tracks seems to have come later. The \"Thomas the Tank Engine\" theme from Learning Curve used track pieces that had the traditional railway design on one side and a new road design on the other using a design invented by Ben Orel in 1960. These roads had the same profile and measurements as the railway tracks, except that the part between the grooves was missing so that the road was a broad \"groove\" with sidings or curbs. The road vehicles and the railway rolling stock could be used interchangeable on both systems. Brio had introduced a track with wider grooves that was used for trains aimed at a younger age group. These used the same connection system as the other tracks and had the same distance between the grooves. This made it possible for the normal trains to run on the wider tracks. When these wide grooves have the same width as the \"Thomas the Tank Engine\" road pieces they can be used as a two way road. Other companies have since adopted this system.\n\n==The rolling stock and accessories==\n\n=== Design origins and developments ===\n[[Image:Heros Lok01.png|right|thumb|220px|3d Ldraw rendering of a wooden toy locomotive in the style of HEROS around 1970]]\nEarly sets such as of Skaneateles,<ref>Marshal H. Larrabee claiming a [http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPATD128493 patent] for his original ornamental design in 1941.</ref> Eichhorn and Brio all seem to have used rather simple and abstract designs. The pieces were not painted, so that trains and tracks had the same surface. The normal early trains had engines and wagons each carved from a single piece of wood and connected by hooks and eyes. Painted sets may have become common in the early 1970s, as did the use of magnets as connectors. Engines carved from a single block were commonly painted black in Europe with bright red funnels and wheels. The early trains made with construction sets and large pull-along trains may have influenced other early train designs that were built of several wood pieces (\"cut broomstick design\" among others). Normally each wooden piece had its own color, thus an engine, for example, could sport six different colors: one each for the base plate, the cylindrical boiler, the drivers cabin, the cabin roof, the funnels and the wheels. Sets with painted patterns seem to have become more popular in the late 1980s and 1990s. This may have been due to the success of the \"Thomas the Tank Engine\" series and the wish for more realistic real world designs.\n\nAs of 2007 there seem to be several design trends:\n* One group seems to emphasize the material wood. Some are simple \"back to the roots\" designs, while others take a more artistic approach, searching for new ways to abstract the train theme.\n* Another group tries to stay true to the material wood but use more realistic designs with series based on famous real life trains.\n* A modern view is to use more and more plastic and build battery powered and remote controlled objects, with electronic devices gaining ground.\n* Specialty trains for specific purposes like alphabet trains and name trains, as well as decoration sets like birthday trains with candles and promotional designs for special events.\n\nTrain tables are a popular way to set up trains and railways, with fixed versions often placed in waiting rooms at hospitals, doctors' offices, or other places where some entertainment for children may be offered. This way they stay off the ground and it is not necessary to take apart the track after it is built!  Wooden railway layouts based on the [[wTrak]] module standard have become part of [[model railroad]] shows in the [[United States]] - starting in the [[Pacific Northwest]] in 2009.\n\n===Bridges and tunnels===\nEarly Skaneateles sets had rectangular supports that raised the track gradually. Due to the different connection system Skaneateles used at that time, tracks could be easily bent upwards at the connection point. The two-piece bridge with massive, self-supporting, ramps has been common since the 1960s. Provided with supports, this bridge could be easily elongated using normal straights. More modern bridge designs have used large amounts of plastic since the 1980s, reducing the amount of wood needed and thus producing lighter and cheaper designs. A sturdy basic bridge is the three-part bridge with the connections in the ramp section. Such designs seem to be aimed at the youngest players as they do not come apart easily. However, the design is not extendable. The two part bridge led to the development of some raised track pieces. First versions had [[viaduct]]-like designs or sported some sort of gadget like a [[drawbridge]]. Later ramps were track bent in an S-shape.<ref>[http://213.179.68.166/nb-cgi/getdoc.pl?DEF=c%3A%5Cdata%5Csp_nb%5Chida;DATEN=c%3A%5Cdata%5Csp_nb%5Cinv;THE=c%3A%5Cdata%5Csp_nb%5Cidx;USER=test;BAG=1;POS=2;DOK_TPL=foto_doc_ausw.tpl;LIST_TPL=foto_ausw.tpl;FCT=g;COOK=inv%20n0011960%3C%3Einv%20n0024334%3C%3Einv%20n1012511%3C%3Einv%20n0013757%3C%3Einv%20n0014310%3C%3Einv%20n0014458%3C%3Einv%20n0017264%3C%3Einv%20n0019107%3C%3Einv%20n0020094%3C%3Einv%20n0021890%3C%3Einv%20n0024184%3C%3Einv%20n0025561%3C%3Einv%20n0026811%3C%3Einv%20n0029329%3C%3Einv%20n0029351%3C%3Einv%20n0033088%3C%3Einv%20n0033809%3C%3Einv%20n1002509%3C%3Einv%20n1002970%3C%3Einv%20n1004284%3C%3Einv%20n1004285%3C%3Einv%20n1007721%3C%3Einv%20n1009617%3C%3Einv%20n1009619%3C%3Einv%20n1009620%3C%3Einv%20n1010543%3C%3Einv%20n1012510%3C%3Einv%20n1018155%3C%3Einv%20n1011851%3C%3Einv%20n1020065%3C%3Einv%20n1020066%3C%3Einv%20n1020067;KEY=inv%20n1012511; Brio Bridge from before 1981], Spielzeug Museum N\u00fcrnberg, Number 1981.5111</ref> As these were not self-supporting, new sorts of elevated track pieces were introduced. These consisted of a short piece of track raised by four legs. These supports were stackable and based on a square design, so that the direction could be changed by a right angle turn on the different levels.\n\n===Buildings===\nEarly buildings had windows and doors made by drawing lines in a single color on simple rectangular blocks. Sometimes they had slanted roofs made with another piece of wood, painted another color, stacked on top. A common early station design consisted of a simple platform with a roof on two or three supports along the longer axis. Later buildings have printed multicolor patterns. There have always been building sets that were similar to the popular [[Toy block|wooden building blocks]], allowing lots of individual designs. Since the 1990s building designs have become more sophisticated and interaction with the trains has increased. Learning Curve may have made this approach popular with many designs based on the story plots of the ''Thomas the Tank'' series, such as a grain loader accessory<ref>[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6592427.html based on a U.S. Patent filed on Feb. 11 1999] (Toy vehicle grain loader accessory)</ref> or a logging mill.<ref>[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6015329.html US Patent filed on Jan. 28 1998] (Toy vehicle logging mill accessory)</ref>\n\n===Licensing and merchandise themes===\n* [[Sesame Street]] - (Playskool 70s?, Strombecker-[[Tootsie toys]] 1995),<ref>[http://www.drtoy.com/1995/t23.html#StrombeckerTootsieToy Sesame Street Wooden Railway] listed among 100 best toys of 1995 by [[Stevanne Auerbach|Dr.Toy]]</ref> DealMakers 2008<ref>As shown on their [http://www.dealmakers.nl/en/product.html?type=Train&character=sesamestreet Homepage]</ref>\n* [[Thomas the Tank Engine]] - (Learning Curve 1993-2011, Brio late 1990s-2000, Tomy 2012-2013, Mattel 2013-Present)\n* [[Jim Button and Luke the Engine Driver|Jim Knopf/Button]] - (Euro-Play pre 2000?(Tesco?), Brio from 2000 on)\n* [[Bob the Builder]] - (Brio 2001)\n* [[Benjamin the Elephant|Benjamin Bl\u00fcmchen]] - (Eichhorn 2001)\n* [[Curious George]] - (Brio 2002)\n* [[Busytown]] - (Brio 2002)\n* [[Babar the Elephant]] - (Brio, France)\n* [[The Little Engine that Could]] - (Maxim until mid-2005,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050204024036/maximenterprise.com/tletc.htm Maxim page on the Waybackmachine Internet Archive]</ref> Whittle Shortline as of 2006)\n* [[Winnie the Pooh]] - (Strombecker-[[Tootsie toys]] 2004?, Eichhorn 2006, Brio 2008)\n* [[The Polar Express]] - (Brio 2006)\n* [[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]] - (Brio 2008)<ref>[http://www.playthings.com/article/CA6495111.html \"Brio ties in with Disney\"] on the Playthings website, 29 October 2007</ref>\n* [[Chuggington]] - (2010/11 as The Chuggington Wooden Railway)\n* [[Cars (film)|Cars the Movie]] - (Wood Collection line from Toys \u201cR\u201d Us 2011<ref>[http://route66news.com/2011/02/10/new-wooden-toys-created-of-cars-characters/ New wooden toys created of \u201cCars\u201d characters] on the Route 66 News website.</ref>)\n\n==Brands==\n\n===Asia===\n* China produces for many companies (Remus, Europlay, Babalu, Maxim, Early Learning Centre, Learning Curve, Brio, Sevi, Munipals).

This toy company made wooden toy trains and wooden tracks.<ref>[http://www.tacny.org/technologist/issue0601.html Technology Club Newsletter from June 2001]</ref> The gauge was very similar to that used by most companies today. However, the connections for the track pieces were of a different design than the jigsaw style \"peg and hole\" system used today.<ref>[http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT2254153 US patent 2254153] from 1940 concerning Marshal H.

The production line was closed in 2002.<ref>[http://www.tacny.org/technologist/2002/issue0902.html Technology Club Newsletter from September 2002]</ref>\n\nThe Jack-Built Toy Manufacturing Company marketed its own range of wooden toy trains under the brand name \"Jack Built Snap Trains\" around 1956 to 1962. These were manufactured in Japan and used a snap system to join pieces of rolling stock and tracks. Rolling stock from Jack Built Snap Trains and [[Skaneateles Handicrafters]] could ride on either manufacturer's tracks. However, individual pieces of rolling stock and track from the two brands could not be combined. This is because the coupling systems for the tracks and trains were different.\n\nCalifornia-based Ben Orel filed U.S. patent #2847798<ref>[http://www.google.com/patents?id=tLdeAAAAEBAJ&dq=2847798 US patent 2939245] from 1960 concerning Ben Orel's Wooden Toy Train \"snap\" coupling system</ref> in 1956 and was granted the patent for his \"snap coupling\" system two years later.

[[Seiffen]] made wooden figures and Christmas decorations and Blumenau (today a part of [[Olbernhau]]) created building blocks and construction sets. Mass production techniques for polishing and coloring wooden toys were established and perfected in the Bohemian areas.<ref>[http://www.baukastensammler.de/technologie/trommelpolieren.html Description] of the production process at the [http://www.baukastensammler.de/ \"Construction Toy Collector\"] site of Joachim Kleindienst. English summary: Johann Schowanek of Georgental (Jiretin, part of Albrechtsdorf) in Bohemia, now within the Czech Republic, invented or perfected the process of polishing and coloring his wooden items in rotating drums starting with the production of wooden beads in 1908. He presented some of his toy products for the first time at the Leipzig Trade Fair in 1927. The toy companies of the Seiffen and Blumenau regions among others showed great interest and soon started similar developments of their own.</ref> Some of the early sets exhibited train designs that were later used for wooden track trains.

In 1961, he started producing his version of a wooden track railway system. Eichhorn claims that his company is the first to have systematically used the \"vario system\" for the connectors. Eichhorn applied for a U.S. patent<ref>[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5427561.html US Patent 5,427,561 from Jun.27,1995]</ref> for a \"battery powered toy train\" in 1994.

The train lines where dropped and the focus shifted to wooden toy blocks and the constructor toy range while Eichhorn became the only supplier of toy trains on a wooden track system within the Simba-Dickie-Group.\n\n===The 1990s, new companies and new ideas===\n\n\"[[Thomas the Tank Engine]]\" is a character created by the [[W.V. Awdry|Rev. W. Awdry]] in ''[[The Railway Series]]'' of children's books, first published in the U.K. in 1945. In 1984 a television series called ''[[Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends]]'' was made, adding to the popularity of the characters. It was first broadcast in the United States in 1989. John W. Lee founded the company \"[[Learning Curve Brands|Learning Curve Toys]]\" in November 1992 with a wooden railway system called \"[[Thomas and Friends Wooden Railway|Thomas & Friends]]\" based on the Thomas the Tank Engine characters. This made the wooden toy trains even more popular than before. Learning Curve introduced some new designs for the track surface, such as the \"Clickety Clack\" rails patented 1995<ref>[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5454513.html US Patent 5,454,513 from Oct.3,1995]</ref> and the newer tracks in 2002<ref>[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6648237.html US Patent 6,648,237 B2 from Nov.18,2003]</ref> with a relief to supply better traction grip for battery powered four wheel drive trains patented in 1998.<ref>[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6089952.html US Patent 6089952 filed on Jan.28,1998]</ref> The ''Thomas'' brand of wooden trains continues to this day under the branding of ''Thomas and Friends Wood'' and are released by [[Mattel|Mattel\u2019s]] ''[[Fisher-Price]]'' subdivision.\n\nWith the popularity of the toy system rising due to the success of ''Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends'', new markets outside of the traditional groups and countries were opened. While companies such as Mapple Landmark adjusted its existing line of \"Name Trains\" to the gauge of the vario system in 1993, others such as [[Whittle Shortline]], established in 1997, started producing rolling stock based on the more realistic designs of existing American examples.<ref>This led to longer rolling stock with an own new bogie design, as [http://www.google.com/patents?id=lDYKAAAAEBAJ shown in a patent] granted to Michael W. Whitworth of Whittle Shortline in 2002.</ref> While Brio and ''Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends'' clearly favoured the steam engine era, Whittle Shortline expanded into heavy duty diesel engines of designs hardly known in Europe. In the product line \"Trains of the World\" shown in the Brio catalog of 1998, Brio presents several historic steam engines, such as the [[LNER Class A4 4468 Mallard|Mallard]] or the [[LNER Class A3 4472 Flying Scotsman|Flying Scotsman]] along with several modern high speed trains such as the [[Shinkansen]], [[TGV]] or [[Intercity-Express|ICE]]. The only diesel unit is from the Santa Fe line. \n\nOther companies, such as Nilo and KidKraft, concentrated on related items like train tables, among other products. Suretrack sells its track securing clips, and Choo Choo Track & Toy Co., founded in 1999, has concentrated on producing and designing tracks and accessories.\n\n====Subway & Commuter Rail Systems====\nA recent sub-genre has emerged based on real-life prototypes of subway and commuter rail rolling stock. One example is the \"New York City Subway Wooden Railway\" by the company named \"Munipals\" which sells units in each of the NYC subway lines colors & markings. They have recently expanded to commuter rail line rolling stock for New Jersey, Metro North, LIRR, and Philadelphia. The Washington DC Metro store sells rolling stock in each of the DC Metro line markings; as does the web store of the Boston T. The London Underground museum store sells rolling stock in the colors of each of the London Underground Lines. Whittle Shortline sells commuter rail line rolling stock for the California and the Chicago transit systems; Bauer & Sohn has rolling stock for Berlin, Munich, and Nuremberg; Lalok, rolling stock for Vienna subway and tram. Perhaps the Tokyo, Moscow, and other international subway systems will follow suit.\n\n===Electronics and Asian Production Sites===\n\n====Electronics====\nAlthough the original push-along trains made mostly of wood still resemble the core idea of this system toy and as of 2006 form the base of all the involved companies' production lines, electronics have gained access to the wooden world. After introducing battery powered engines in the 1990s, remote control had been added by 2002, and so-called smart tracks introduced plastic parts to the wooden track pieces. In 2006 Brio even introduced a theme resembling electronic networking with some electronic gadgets. Altogether this has led to some new track designs allowing better traction for the self powered trains or means of communication between the tracks and trains using some magnetic or electronic gadget.\n\n====Asian production====\nAs with other toys, many wooden trains and track have been manufactured in China and other Asian countries in the twenty-first century. The lead paint problems of 2007<ref>[http://recalls.rc2.com/recalls_Wood_0607.html Lead paint recall of June 13th, 2007, by RC2 Corporation]</ref> brought this to public awareness. Manufacturing in Asia goes back a lot further though: already in the 1950s the Snap-Trains of Ben Orel were made in Japan.\n\nProbably the first major brand that was manufactured in China was the Chicago-based \"Thomas and Friends Wooden Railway\". Some of the design, such as the character faces and the spoked wheels, have stayed unique to the brand while other attributes, such as the modular build of the units with a rectangular single block chassis holding the wheels and individual buildup on top, have become widespread designs in China and elsewhere. Another major brand is Maxim. Starting with traditional rather plain and abstract designs, Maxim sold products under the name \"Tumble Tree Wood\" for retail stores. They have since adopted their current design with a winged number on their rolling stock. The main supplier is a factory in [[Dongguan|Dong Guan]], China. The trains with the winged numbers are also sold by other brands such as Babalu in Germany. In 2004,<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/18/business/worldbusiness/18toys.html?pagewanted=print New York Times article of September 18, 2007]</ref> Brio of Sweden moved most of their production to three factories in [[Guangdong]] Province, China. A more recent brand is Melissa & Doug that is also produced in China. Smaller projects were the short-lived ventures of Remus and Europlay.\n\nA producer that has sold its products under very many brands including its own name is Mentari Massen, with its main factory founded in 1988 in [[Surabaya]], Indonesia. Their items have been sold as sets or individually bundled under such brand names as elile, FunToys, Toytopia, The Toy Company, Bino, Snap on Tools and Bigjigs, as well as Mentari Toys or Mentari Group.\n\nA quite prolific producer with its own clear design is Plantoys of Thailand. They have been making children's toys and furniture from rubber wood, which has since been adopted by other companies. They have a range of car and city related sets that could be used as accessories for the wooden toy train ranges of other producers. They had a joint venture with Brio in 2001\u20132002,<ref>[http://www.playthings.com/article/CA225766.html?q=plan+toy Note] at the www.playthings.com site on the joint venture plans of Brio and Plan Toys from 2001.</ref> being present in the Brio catalogs of the time. By 2007 they had started their own line of wooden trains, expanding it in 2008.\n\nIn 1985, Bigjigs Toys Ltd started out by selling a large range of wooden jigsaws. Then in the 1990s they moved into the wooden railway market with a small core range of wooden railway system items. In 2007 they re-launched their railway range under the brand Bigjigs Rail, in new blue sky and green hills packaging. There are, as of 2012, over 130 pieces in the Bigjigs Rail range including sets, track and a range of real life engines such as Mallard, Duchess of Hamilton and Bluebell.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n==The track system==\nAlthough the products of many companies are quite compatible with each other they may vary in make, the wood used and some basic measurements. Popular woods used and advertised thus are [[beech]], [[maple]] and [[rubber tree]].\n\n=== The gauge ===\n[[Image:Woodtrackprofil.png|right|thumb|Profiles of wooden tracks for toy trains]]\nTrack grooves are 3&nbsp;mm deep, 6&nbsp;mm wide and have 20&nbsp;mm between them (26 mm center to center). The tracks themselves are 40&nbsp;mm wide and 12&nbsp;mm high. To be kept on track the system can be reduced to a shallow groove 30&nbsp;mm wide, as in some road systems or small ramps that allow the vehicle to get on or off the track from the floor, or to a middle section 20&nbsp;mm wide and 3&nbsp;mm high, as in some beginners tracks or double track road systems. Most modern track systems have a somewhat sophisticated profile with varying degrees of slanted sides for the grooves or rounded edges. In the imperial system the tracks have been described as having grooves an eighth of an inch deep, a quarter of an inch wide and with three quarters of an inch between them. The tracks themselves are one and a half inches wide and half an inch high.<ref>[http://pw1.netcom.com/~thoog/hnr/hnr.html Todd Hoogerland on the Gauge Standards]</ref> However, unlike other model railroading gauges, which have been formally defined by enthusiast groups such as the [[National Model Railroad Association]] or the [[Normen Europ\u00e4ischer Modellbahnen]], there is no agreed gauge for wooden trains. The actual cross sectional profile of any given manufacturer's track is usually patented, compelling new manufacturers to alter their track design enough to allow compatibility with other brands without committing patent infringement.\n\n===Flipping track pieces===\nSome track pieces such as curves and points have grooves on both sides so that they can be used from both sides. By flipping the piece around one can convert a left-hand curve or point to a right-handed one. Another possibility is to have the two grooves for trains on the one side and the single wide groove for roads on the other side. Ben Orel describes such a system in U.S. patent #3013726,<ref name=\"Orel-1961\" /> which he submitted in 1960. Learning Curve made such tracks for their \"Thomas the Tank Engine\" theme.\n\n===The Vario system===\nWhen trying to document a layout with exact geometry one quickly notices that a lot of layouts one builds with real track do not work using a CAD system or some track layout program.<ref>[http://www.woodenrailway.info/track/trackmath.html John Mechalas on track layout geometry with the Vario System.]</ref> This is due to the so-called \"vario system\" which allows some play when joining the tracks, so that with some wiggling around one can make layouts line up perfectly with no danger of derailing trains which do not use the exact geometry of the pieces. This is achieved by making the pegs somewhat smaller than the holes. Sometimes the round part of the hole is not an exact circle but rather an ellipse, allowing the tracks to connect with a small gap between them. Also, the neck gap does not have a sharp edge at the end of the track, but is carved round. This may have started as a production loss or to make it easier for small children to join the tracks. Some sources{{who|date=July 2012}} state that Eichhorn was the first to design connections using this system.\n\n===Some track and layout geometry===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nThough not all manufacturers use the same system for their track piece designs some principle standards have evolved, as the geometry involved with track systems tends to pose the same problems to everyone. The first question may be how to divide the circle. The standard for wooden tracks is eight pieces. The next important length is the diameter of the circle made of a line along the center of the tracks. This length is useful for figures such as an eight with the crossing at right angles, a simple L-figure, a bulge to one side or a spectacles or Mickey Mouse head, to name the simplest.\n\nA division in two gives a handy piece of straight track. For the figure eight one could use two straight pieces to go underneath and a bridge made to the same length to cross over the other straights. If one wants a crossing on the same level, the diameter can be divided by three and a crossing piece made with straights of that length. Of course one can also produce pieces of a quarter diameter length to put to the left and right of a central bridge piece that is half the length of the diameter. As one can see, it is useful to determine the length of the straight tracks by dividing the diameter of the circle made by the curves. Brio uses lengths of half, quarter and eighth as well as a third and sixth.\n\nTo solve problems of offset produced by points that branch out at the same angle producing parallel tracks, it is also useful to design such points and switches so that one of the short straights can compensate the offset. An easy way to design points is by tracing a long and a curved track to the same piece using the same connecting point as the origin. Such a merged piece can thus serve as a curve for one branch and a straight for the other while using the same dimensions as the other pieces.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Figure8.png|\nImage:FigureL.png|\nImage:Figurebulge2.png|\nImage:Briodevisionsystem.png|\n</gallery>\n\n===Road systems===\nSeveral approaches have been made over time to add a road system to the railway tracks. The first and still most widely used level crossings use simple ramps that enable vehicles to cross the thick tracks from whatever underground the tracks are placed on. The simplest way to add roads to this existing solution is to provide a layout printed on a paper or plastic sheet or even a carpet that uses the dimensions of the wooden tracks. Some companies have made thin track pieces out of plastic or other materials that can be joined by some connecting system and have special crossover pieces to allow playing together with a wooden railway system. The next step seems to have been road track pieces of similar thickness as the railway tracks but using some other connecting design. Using the same \"peg and hole\" system as the railway tracks seems to have come later. The \"Thomas the Tank Engine\" theme from Learning Curve used track pieces that had the traditional railway design on one side and a new road design on the other using a design invented by Ben Orel in 1960. These roads had the same profile and measurements as the railway tracks, except that the part between the grooves was missing so that the road was a broad \"groove\" with sidings or curbs. The road vehicles and the railway rolling stock could be used interchangeable on both systems. Brio had introduced a track with wider grooves that was used for trains aimed at a younger age group. These used the same connection system as the other tracks and had the same distance between the grooves. This made it possible for the normal trains to run on the wider tracks. When these wide grooves have the same width as the \"Thomas the Tank Engine\" road pieces they can be used as a two way road. Other companies have since adopted this system.\n\n==The rolling stock and accessories==\n\n=== Design origins and developments ===\n[[Image:Heros Lok01.png|right|thumb|220px|3d Ldraw rendering of a wooden toy locomotive in the style of HEROS around 1970]]\nEarly sets such as of Skaneateles,<ref>Marshal H. Larrabee claiming a [http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPATD128493 patent] for his original ornamental design in 1941.</ref> Eichhorn and Brio all seem to have used rather simple and abstract designs. The pieces were not painted, so that trains and tracks had the same surface. The normal early trains had engines and wagons each carved from a single piece of wood and connected by hooks and eyes. Painted sets may have become common in the early 1970s, as did the use of magnets as connectors. Engines carved from a single block were commonly painted black in Europe with bright red funnels and wheels. The early trains made with construction sets and large pull-along trains may have influenced other early train designs that were built of several wood pieces (\"cut broomstick design\" among others). Normally each wooden piece had its own color, thus an engine, for example, could sport six different colors: one each for the base plate, the cylindrical boiler, the drivers cabin, the cabin roof, the funnels and the wheels. Sets with painted patterns seem to have become more popular in the late 1980s and 1990s. This may have been due to the success of the \"Thomas the Tank Engine\" series and the wish for more realistic real world designs.\n\nAs of 2007 there seem to be several design trends:\n* One group seems to emphasize the material wood. Some are simple \"back to the roots\" designs, while others take a more artistic approach, searching for new ways to abstract the train theme.\n* Another group tries to stay true to the material wood but use more realistic designs with series based on famous real life trains.\n* A modern view is to use more and more plastic and build battery powered and remote controlled objects, with electronic devices gaining ground.\n* Specialty trains for specific purposes like alphabet trains and name trains, as well as decoration sets like birthday trains with candles and promotional designs for special events.\n\nTrain tables are a popular way to set up trains and railways, with fixed versions often placed in waiting rooms at hospitals, doctors' offices, or other places where some entertainment for children may be offered. This way they stay off the ground and it is not necessary to take apart the track after it is built!  Wooden railway layouts based on the [[wTrak]] module standard have become part of [[model railroad]] shows in the [[United States]] - starting in the [[Pacific Northwest]] in 2009.\n\n===Bridges and tunnels===\nEarly Skaneateles sets had rectangular supports that raised the track gradually. Due to the different connection system Skaneateles used at that time, tracks could be easily bent upwards at the connection point. The two-piece bridge with massive, self-supporting, ramps has been common since the 1960s. Provided with supports, this bridge could be easily elongated using normal straights. More modern bridge designs have used large amounts of plastic since the 1980s, reducing the amount of wood needed and thus producing lighter and cheaper designs. A sturdy basic bridge is the three-part bridge with the connections in the ramp section. Such designs seem to be aimed at the youngest players as they do not come apart easily. However, the design is not extendable. The two part bridge led to the development of some raised track pieces. First versions had [[viaduct]]-like designs or sported some sort of gadget like a [[drawbridge]]. Later ramps were track bent in an S-shape.<ref>[http://213.179.68.166/nb-cgi/getdoc.pl?DEF=c%3A%5Cdata%5Csp_nb%5Chida;DATEN=c%3A%5Cdata%5Csp_nb%5Cinv;THE=c%3A%5Cdata%5Csp_nb%5Cidx;USER=test;BAG=1;POS=2;DOK_TPL=foto_doc_ausw.tpl;LIST_TPL=foto_ausw.tpl;FCT=g;COOK=inv%20n0011960%3C%3Einv%20n0024334%3C%3Einv%20n1012511%3C%3Einv%20n0013757%3C%3Einv%20n0014310%3C%3Einv%20n0014458%3C%3Einv%20n0017264%3C%3Einv%20n0019107%3C%3Einv%20n0020094%3C%3Einv%20n0021890%3C%3Einv%20n0024184%3C%3Einv%20n0025561%3C%3Einv%20n0026811%3C%3Einv%20n0029329%3C%3Einv%20n0029351%3C%3Einv%20n0033088%3C%3Einv%20n0033809%3C%3Einv%20n1002509%3C%3Einv%20n1002970%3C%3Einv%20n1004284%3C%3Einv%20n1004285%3C%3Einv%20n1007721%3C%3Einv%20n1009617%3C%3Einv%20n1009619%3C%3Einv%20n1009620%3C%3Einv%20n1010543%3C%3Einv%20n1012510%3C%3Einv%20n1018155%3C%3Einv%20n1011851%3C%3Einv%20n1020065%3C%3Einv%20n1020066%3C%3Einv%20n1020067;KEY=inv%20n1012511; Brio Bridge from before 1981], Spielzeug Museum N\u00fcrnberg, Number 1981.5111</ref> As these were not self-supporting, new sorts of elevated track pieces were introduced. These consisted of a short piece of track raised by four legs. These supports were stackable and based on a square design, so that the direction could be changed by a right angle turn on the different levels.\n\n===Buildings===\nEarly buildings had windows and doors made by drawing lines in a single color on simple rectangular blocks. Sometimes they had slanted roofs made with another piece of wood, painted another color, stacked on top. A common early station design consisted of a simple platform with a roof on two or three supports along the longer axis. Later buildings have printed multicolor patterns. There have always been building sets that were similar to the popular [[Toy block|wooden building blocks]], allowing lots of individual designs. Since the 1990s building designs have become more sophisticated and interaction with the trains has increased. Learning Curve may have made this approach popular with many designs based on the story plots of the ''Thomas the Tank'' series, such as a grain loader accessory<ref>[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6592427.html based on a U.S. Patent filed on Feb. 11 1999] (Toy vehicle grain loader accessory)</ref> or a logging mill.<ref>[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6015329.html US Patent filed on Jan. 28 1998] (Toy vehicle logging mill accessory)</ref>\n\n===Licensing and merchandise themes===\n* [[Sesame Street]] - (Playskool 70s?, Strombecker-[[Tootsie toys]] 1995),<ref>[http://www.drtoy.com/1995/t23.html#StrombeckerTootsieToy Sesame Street Wooden Railway] listed among 100 best toys of 1995 by [[Stevanne Auerbach|Dr.Toy]]</ref> DealMakers 2008<ref>As shown on their [http://www.dealmakers.nl/en/product.html?type=Train&character=sesamestreet Homepage]</ref>\n* [[Thomas the Tank Engine]] - (Learning Curve 1993-2011, Brio late 90\u2019s-2000, Tomy 2012-2013, Mattel 2013-Present)\n* [[Jim Button and Luke the Engine Driver|Jim Knopf/Button]] - (Euro-Play pre 2000?(Tesco?), Brio from 2000 on)\n* [[Bob the Builder]] - (Brio 2001)\n* [[Benjamin the Elephant|Benjamin Bl\u00fcmchen]] - (Eichhorn 2001)\n* [[Curious George]] - (Brio 2002)\n* [[Busytown]] - (Brio 2002)\n* [[Babar the Elephant]] - (Brio, France)\n* [[The Little Engine that Could]] - (Maxim until mid-2005,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050204024036/maximenterprise.com/tletc.htm Maxim page on the Waybackmachine Internet Archive]</ref> Whittle Shortline as of 2006)\n* [[Winnie the Pooh]] - (Strombecker-[[Tootsie toys]] 2004?, Eichhorn 2006, Brio 2008)\n* [[The Polar Express]] - (Brio 2006)\n* [[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]] - (Brio 2008)<ref>[http://www.playthings.com/article/CA6495111.html \"Brio ties in with Disney\"] on the Playthings website, 29 October 2007</ref>\n* [[Chuggington]] - (2010/11 as The Chuggington Wooden Railway)\n* [[Cars (film)|Cars the Movie]] - (Wood Collection line from Toys \u201cR\u201d Us 2011<ref>[http://route66news.com/2011/02/10/new-wooden-toys-created-of-cars-characters/ New wooden toys created of \u201cCars\u201d characters] on the Route 66 News website.</ref>)\n\n==Brands==\n\n===Asia===\n* China produces for many companies (Remus, Europlay, Babalu, Maxim, Early Learning Centre, Learning Curve, Brio, Sevi, Munipals).

Coming from the tradition of classic Arabian calligraphy however, he tried to reduce the evidence of perceivable language even further to the point of him using the bare shapes of his source material for the intricacy of the [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]]. Using acrylics, chalk, ink, [[Charcoal (art)|charcoal]], and metal to establish a wide range of intercepted and connected spaces. In his figurative and abstract works Aatifi also turns to printmaking in various techniques, which he first got in contact with when living in Dresden.

'Aatifi comes from a living tradition, which also distinguishes him from a number of contemporary artists [ ... ]. The strengths of the tradition - i.e. the foundations of classical aesthetics in calligraphy - are not always known, nor is the freedom of distancing oneself from these understood. That's why poor imitations of cultural archetypes are produced. Not so with Aatifi. Aatifi pulls off the balancing act [ ... ].<ref>Stefan Weber: Strangeness-Familiarity and Dynamism \u2013 Aesthetics and Cultural Background in Aatifi's Works In: Martina Bauer (ed.): ''Aatifi \u2013 News from Afghanistan.''

Coming from the tradition of classic Arabian calligraphy however, he tried to reduce the evidence of perceivable language even further to the point of him using the bare shapes of his source material for the intricacy of the [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]]. Using acrylics, chalk, ink, [[Charcoal (art)|charcoal]], and metal to establish a wide range of intercepted and connected spaces. In his figurative and abstract works Aatifi also turns to printmaking in various techniques, which he first got in contact with when living in Dresden. His colour palette is a representation of his experiences in Afghanistan and Germany, but is also based on his travels around the world.<ref>Janina Strathmeier: On the Origin of Explosive Colourfulness: The Balance between Tradition and Modernity in Art, In: Martina Bauer (ed.): ''Aatifi \u2013 News from Afghanistan.''
