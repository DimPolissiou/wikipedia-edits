During the early part of his career, he was a more attacking batsman and frequently scored centuries at close to a run a ball.

During the early part of his career, he was a more attacking batsman and frequently scored centuries at close to a run a ball.

Despite this, episodes from Series 6 and \"The Specials II\" utilize the ''Horrible Histories Special'' title card which the earlier series used for one-off programs.\n\nIn 2014 CBBC executives announced that, owing to the critical and popular success of the original, discussions were underway regarding some form of return. Original series star [[Mathew Baynton]] subsequently confirmed that he and the other five members of the starring cast would not be reuniting as a team for the new project.<ref name=\"BCGS6\">{{cite web | url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/news/story/000001535/horrible_histories_series_6/ | title=Horrible Histories Series 6 in planning | work=British Comedy Guide | date=4 July 2014 | accessdate=3 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe resulting series, while sharing the same core concept, genre and sensibilities as its predecessor\u2014including an original parody song in each episode\u2014follows a notably different format. In lieu of the previous short, unconnected sketches from randomly-selected time periods, the new series consists of specials focusing on the specific life and times of one prominent historical figure. It will also involve a largely all-new production team and cast, while still retaining Greg Jenner as lead historical consultant and many of the original series's writers. In addition, original stars [[Sarah Hadland]], [[Simon Farnaby]], [[Lawry Lewin]] and [[Jim Howick]] returned in limited roles, with Farnaby in particular reprising his role as [[Grim Reaper|Death]]. Several prominent UK comedy veterans, including [[Ben Miller]], [[Kathryn Drysdale]], [[Kevin Eldon]], [[Tom Rosenthal (actor)|Tom Rosenthal]] and [[Rowan Atkinson]], guest-starred as the spotlighted figures.<ref name=\"Series6\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2015/horrible-histories |title=Top comedy stars join CBBC's Horrible Histories|work=BBC Media Centre|date=5 January 2015 |accessdate=28 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2015, the new series debuted with an episode drawing on the events leading up to the signing of ''[[Magna Carta]]'', timed to coincide with the [[BBC]]'s larger commemoration of the document's 800-year anniversary before being followed by a run of fourteen episodes. 2016 saw the broadcast of three specials to mark certain events throughout that year: 400 years since Shakespeare died, the BBC's \"Love to Read\" campaign, and 350 years since the Great Fire of London. There was a slight change in cast where the main stars [[Jalaal Hartley]], [[Tom Stourton]] and [[Jessica Ransom]] continued with some of the supporting cast, while a number of the sixth series cast, including the two original members [[Jim Howick]] and [[Simon Farnaby]] were absent.\n\nA full-length seventh series was aired every Monday on CBBC from June 2017, and it continued into 2018. Hartley, Ransom and Stourton continue alongside [[Gemma Whelan]] and [[Richard David-Caine]] who stayed on from the 2016 specials; [[Ryan Sampson]] now makes up the sixth main cast member. This time, Series 7 focuses each episode on a theme, e.g. music, explorers, medicine, presidents etc. The format is very much the same with recurring sketches, a song or two each episode (with the main songs now placed at the end of each episode, except for ''Ruthless Rulers'' and Series 8's ''Mind Your Manners''), animated characters in-between sketches and quiz questions asked by various historical figures. One notable difference is that of host Rattus Rattus, who has his own storyline based on the theme of the episode and is appearing in many different costumes. Guest-stars include Sanjeev Bhaskar with various roles, as he did in Series 6, and ''[[First Dates]]'' host [[Fred Sirieix]] who appears for 'Historical First Dates' sketches to host.\n\nAn eighth series began filming in September 2018, and began airing on 3 June 2019 on CBBC, with a similar concept to Series 7 (each episode focusing on a theme) whilst also occasionally featuring guest co-hosts. The series had two special episodes: the first one being ''Football with Alex Scott'', a special where a [[guest star]] and [[footballer]] named [[Alex Scott (footballer, born 1984)|Alex Scott]] appeared and hosted her own episode and recounted skits in the show about [[Association football|football]] (''US: soccer'') from seasons from the original [[Horrible Histories (2009 TV series)|2009 Horrible Histories show]] and the sixth season of the 2015 reboot. The second special episode is the newest episode to come out of ''Horrible Histories'', being aired on CBBC on 15 August 2019 - guest star, actress and comedian [[Emily Atack]] hosted her own episode called ''Back to School with Emily Attack''. The episode consisted of her recounting skits from the original ''2009 Horrible Histories'' and the 2015 reboot's seventh season relating to [[School|school and education]].\n\nOn 19 December 2019, It was announced that the remaining episodes of series 8 will air during 2020, however a new ninth series will also be set to air sometime in the year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/HHTV_/status/1207813323447779329|title=Next year the rest of #HorribleHistories Series 8 will air.

Several prominent UK comedy veterans, including [[Ben Miller]], [[Kathryn Drysdale]], [[Kevin Eldon]], [[Tom Rosenthal (actor)|Tom Rosenthal]] and [[Rowan Atkinson]], guest-starred as the spotlighted figures.<ref name=\"Series6\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2015/horrible-histories |title=Top comedy stars join CBBC's Horrible Histories|work=BBC Media Centre|date=5 January 2015 |accessdate=28 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2015, the new series debuted with an episode drawing on the events leading up to the signing of ''[[Magna Carta]]'', timed to coincide with the [[BBC]]'s larger commemoration of the document's 800-year anniversary before being followed by a run of fourteen episodes. 2016 saw the broadcast of three specials to mark certain events throughout that year: 400 years since Shakespeare died, the BBC's \"Love to Read\" campaign, and 350 years since the Great Fire of London. There was a slight change in cast where the main stars [[Jalaal Hartley]], [[Tom Stourton]] and [[Jessica Ransom]] continued with some of the supporting cast, while a number of the sixth series cast, including the two original members [[Jim Howick]] and [[Simon Farnaby]] were absent.\n\nA full-length seventh series was aired every Monday on CBBC from June 2017, and it continued into 2018. Hartley, Ransom and Stourton continue alongside [[Gemma Whelan]] and [[Richard David-Caine]] who stayed on from the 2016 specials; [[Ryan Sampson]] now makes up the sixth main cast member. This time, Series 7 focuses each episode on a theme, e.g. music, explorers, medicine, presidents etc. The format is very much the same with recurring sketches, a song or two each episode (with the main songs now placed at the end of each episode, except for ''Ruthless Rulers'' and Series 8's ''Mind Your Manners''), animated characters in-between sketches and quiz questions asked by various historical figures. One notable difference is that of host Rattus Rattus, who has his own storyline based on the theme of the episode and is appearing in many different costumes. Guest-stars include Sanjeev Bhaskar with various roles, as he did in Series 6, and ''[[First Dates]]'' host [[Fred Sirieix]] who appears for 'Historical First Dates' sketches to host.\n\nAn eighth series began filming in September 2018, and began airing on 3 June 2019 on CBBC, with a similar concept to Series 7 (each episode focusing on a theme) whilst also occasionally featuring guest co-hosts. The series had two special episodes: the first one being ''Football with Alex Scott'', a special where a [[guest star]] and [[footballer]] named [[Alex Scott (footballer, born 1984)|Alex Scott]] appeared and hosted her own episode and recounted skits in the show about [[Association football|football]] (''US: soccer'') from seasons from the original [[Horrible Histories (2009 TV series)|2009 Horrible Histories show]] and the sixth season of the 2015 reboot. The second special episode is the newest episode to come out of ''Horrible Histories'', being aired on CBBC on 15 August 2019 - guest star, actress and comedian [[Emily Atack]] hosted her own episode called ''Back to School with Emily Attack''. The episode consisted of her recounting skits from the original ''2009 Horrible Histories'' and the 2015 reboot's seventh season relating to [[School|school and education]].\n\nOn 19 December 2019, It was announced that the remaining episodes of series 8 will air during 2020, however a new ninth series will also be set to air sometime in the year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/HHTV_/status/1207813323447779329|title=Next year the rest of #HorribleHistories Series 8 will air.

Regarded as one of the most influential artists of the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the [[Cubist]] movement, the invention of [[Assemblage (art)|constructed sculpture]],<ref name=\"moma4\"/><ref name=\"tate1\"/> the co-invention of [[collage]], and for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore. Among his most famous works are the [[Proto-Cubism|proto-Cubist]] ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' (1907), and ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' (1937), a dramatic portrayal of the [[bombing of Guernica]] by the German and Italian airforces during the [[Spanish Civil War]].\n\nPicasso demonstrated extraordinary artistic talent in his early years, painting in a naturalistic manner through his childhood and adolescence. During the first decade of the 20th century, his style changed as he experimented with different theories, techniques, and ideas. After 1906, the [[Fauvist]] work of the slightly older artist [[Henri Matisse]] motivated Picasso to explore more radical styles, beginning a fruitful rivalry between the two artists, who subsequently were often paired by critics as the leaders of modern art.<ref name=\"tate0\"/><ref name=\"fran5\"/><ref name=\"guar6\"/><ref name=\"k12ok\"/>\n\nPicasso's work is often categorized into periods. While the names of many of his later periods are debated, the most commonly accepted periods in his work are the [[Picasso's Blue Period|Blue Period]] (1901\u20131904), the [[Picasso's Rose Period|Rose Period]] (1904\u20131906), the [[Picasso's African Period|African-influenced Period]] (1907\u20131909), Analytic [[Cubism]] (1909\u20131912), and Synthetic Cubism (1912\u20131919), also referred to as the [[Crystal Cubism|Crystal period]]. Much of Picasso's work of the late 1910s and early 1920s is in a [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] style, and his work in the mid-1920s often has characteristics of [[Surrealism]]. His later work often combines elements of his earlier styles.\n\nExceptionally prolific throughout the course of his long life, Picasso achieved universal renown and immense fortune for his revolutionary artistic accomplishments, and became one of the best-known figures in [[20th-century art]].\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Pablo Picasso with his sister Lola, 1889.jpg|thumb|upright|Pablo Picasso with his sister Lola, 1889]]\nPicasso was baptized '''Pablo Diego Jos\u00e9 Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno Mar\u00eda de los Remedios Cipriano de la Sant\u00edsima Trinidad Ruiz y Picasso''',<ref name=\"CatRez\"/> a series of names honouring various saints and relatives.<ref name=\"shsu5\"/> ''Ruiz y Picasso'' were included for his father and mother, respectively, as per Spanish tradition. Born in the city of [[M\u00e1laga]] in the [[Andalusia]]n region of Spain, he was the first child of [[Jos\u00e9 Ruiz y Blasco|Don Jos\u00e9 Ruiz y Blasco]] (1838\u20131913) and Mar\u00eda Picasso y L\u00f3pez.<ref name=\"collier\"/> Though baptized a Catholic, Picasso would later become an atheist.<ref name=\"thepi\"/>\n\nThe surname \"Picasso\" comes from [[Liguria]], a coastal region of north-western Italy; its capital is [[Genoa]].<ref name=\"Fundaci\u00f3n Picasso\"/> There was a painter from the area named {{Interlanguage link|Matteo Picasso|fr}} (1794\u20131879), born in Recco (Genoa), of late neoclassical style portraiture,<ref name=\"Fundaci\u00f3n Picasso\" /> though investigations have not definitively determined his kinship with the branch of ancestors related to Pablo Picasso. The direct branch from [[Sori, Liguria]] (Genoa), can be traced back to Tommaso Picasso (1728\u20131813). His son Giovanni Battista, married to Isabella Musante, was Pablo's great-great-grandfather. Of this marriage was born Tommaso (Sori, 1787\u2013M\u00e1laga, 1851). Pablo's maternal great-grandfather, Tommaso Picasso moved to Spain around 1807.<ref name=\"Fundaci\u00f3n Picasso\" />\n\nPicasso's family was of middle-class background. His father was a painter who specialized in naturalistic depictions of birds and other game. For most of his life Ruiz was a professor of art at the School of Crafts and a [[curator]] of a local museum. Ruiz's ancestors were minor aristocrats.\n\nPicasso showed a passion and a skill for drawing from an early age. According to his mother, his first words were \"piz, piz\", a shortening of ''l\u00e1piz'', the Spanish word for \"pencil\".<ref name=\"Wert9\"/> From the age of seven, Picasso received formal artistic training from his father in figure drawing and oil painting. Ruiz was a traditional academic artist and instructor, who believed that proper training required disciplined copying of the masters, and drawing the human body from plaster casts and live models. His son became preoccupied with art to the detriment of his classwork.\n\nThe family moved to [[A Coru\u00f1a]] in 1891, where his father became a professor at the School of Fine Arts. They stayed almost four years. On one occasion, the father found his son painting over his unfinished sketch of a pigeon. Observing the precision of his son's technique, an [[apocrypha]]l story relates, Ruiz felt that the thirteen-year-old Picasso had surpassed him, and vowed to give up painting,<ref name=\"wert11\"/> though paintings by him exist from later years.\n\nIn 1895, Picasso was traumatized when his seven-year-old sister, Conchita, died of [[diphtheria]].<ref name=\"theatlantic.com\"/> After her death, the family moved to [[Barcelona]], where Ruiz took a position at its School of Fine Arts. Picasso thrived in the city, regarding it in times of sadness or nostalgia as his true home.<ref name=\"w13\"/> Ruiz persuaded the officials at the academy to allow his son to take an entrance exam for the advanced class. This process often took students a month, but Picasso completed it in a week, and the jury admitted him, at just 13. As a student, Picasso lacked discipline but made friendships that would affect him in later life. His father rented a small room for him close to home so he could work alone, yet he checked up on him numerous times a day, judging his drawings. The two argued frequently.<ref name=\"caval\"/>\n\nPicasso's father and uncle decided to send the young artist to Madrid's [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando]], the country's foremost art school.<ref name=\"w13\"/> At age 16, Picasso set off for the first time on his own, but he disliked formal instruction and stopped attending classes soon after enrollment. Madrid held many other attractions. The [[Prado]] housed paintings by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], [[Francisco Goya]], and [[Francisco Zurbar\u00e1n]]. Picasso especially admired the works of [[El Greco]]; elements such as his elongated limbs, arresting colours, and mystical visages are echoed in Picasso's later work.<ref name=\"propos\"/>\n{{-}}\n\n== Career ==\n=== Before 1900 ===\n[[File:Pablo Picasso, 1904, Paris, photograph by Ricard Canals i Llamb\u00ed.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Picasso in 1904. Photograph by [[Ricard Canals]].]]\nPicasso's training under his father began before 1890. His progress can be traced in the collection of early works now held by the [[Museu Picasso]]<!--MUSEU is not a typo--> in Barcelona, which provides one of the most comprehensive records extant of any major artist's beginnings.<ref name=\"cirl6\"/> During 1893 the juvenile quality of his earliest work falls away, and by 1894 his career as a painter can be said to have begun.<ref name=\"cirl14\"/> The academic realism apparent in the works of the mid-1890s is well displayed in ''The First Communion'' (1896), a large composition that depicts his sister, Lola. In the same year, at the age of 14, he painted ''Portrait of Aunt Pepa'', a vigorous and dramatic portrait that Juan-Eduardo Cirlot has called \"without a doubt one of the greatest in the whole history of Spanish painting.\"<ref name=\"cirl37\"/>\n\nIn 1897, his realism began to show a [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] influence, for example, in a series of landscape paintings rendered in non-naturalistic violet and green tones. What some call his Modernist period (1899\u20131900) followed. His exposure to the work of [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti|Rossetti]], [[Th\u00e9ophile Steinlen|Steinlen]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec|Toulouse-Lautrec]] and [[Edvard Munch]], combined with his admiration for favourite old masters such as [[El Greco]], led Picasso to a personal version of modernism in his works of this period.<ref name=\"cirl87\"/>\n\nPicasso made his first trip to [[Paris]], then the art capital of Europe, in 1900. There, he met his first Parisian friend, journalist and poet [[Max Jacob]], who helped Picasso learn the language and its literature. Soon they shared an apartment; Max slept at night while Picasso slept during the day and worked at night. These were times of severe poverty, cold, and desperation. Much of his work was burned to keep the small room warm. During the first five months of 1901, Picasso lived in Madrid, where he and his [[anarchist]] friend Francisco de As\u00eds Soler founded the magazine ''Arte Joven'' (''Young Art''), which published five issues. Soler solicited articles and Picasso illustrated the journal, mostly contributing grim cartoons depicting and sympathizing with the state of the poor. The first issue was published on 31 March 1901, by which time the artist had started to sign his work ''Picasso''.<ref name=\"cirl125\"/> From 1898 he signed his works as \"Pablo Ruiz Picasso\", then as \"Pablo R. Picasso\" until 1901. The change does not seem to imply a rejection of the father figure. Rather, he wanted to distinguish himself from others; initiated by his Catalan friends who habitually called him by his maternal surname, much less current than the paternal Ruiz.<ref>Fermigier, Andr\u00e9 (1969).

In his austere use of colour and sometimes doleful subject matter \u2013 prostitutes and beggars are frequent subjects \u2013 Picasso was influenced by a trip through Spain and by the suicide of his friend [[Carles Casagemas]]. Starting in autumn of 1901 he painted several posthumous portraits of Casagemas, culminating in the gloomy allegorical painting ''La Vie'' (1903), now in the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]].<ref name=\"watte\"/>\n\nThe same mood pervades the well-known etching ''The Frugal Repast'' (1904),<ref name=\"metmu\"/> which depicts a blind man and a sighted woman, both emaciated, seated at a nearly bare table. Blindness is a recurrent theme in Picasso's works of this period, also represented in ''The Blindman's Meal'' (1903, the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]) and in the portrait of ''Celestina'' (1903). Other Blue Period works include ''Portrait of Soler'' and ''[[Portrait of Suzanne Bloch]]''.\n\n=== Rose Period: 1904\u20131906 ===\n{{details|Picasso's Rose Period}}\n\n[[File:Pablo Picasso, 1905, Au Lapin Agile (At the Lapin Agile), oil on canvas, 99.1 x 100.3 cm, Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|Pablo Picasso, 1905, ''Au Lapin Agile'' (''At the Lapin Agile'') (''Arlequin tenant un verre''), oil on canvas, 99.1 \u00d7 100.3&nbsp;cm, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]\nThe Rose Period (1904\u20131906)<ref name=\"Watte194\"/> is characterized by a lighter tone and style utilizing orange and pink colours, and featuring many circus people, [[Family of Acrobats (study)|acrobats]] and [[harlequin]]s known in France as saltimbanques. The harlequin, a comedic character usually depicted in checkered patterned clothing, became a personal symbol for Picasso. Picasso met [[Fernande Olivier]], a [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] artist who became his mistress, in Paris in 1904.<ref name=\"theatlantic.com\"/> Olivier appears in many of his Rose Period paintings, many of which are influenced by his warm relationship with her, in addition to his increased exposure to French painting. The generally upbeat and optimistic mood of paintings in this period is reminiscent of the 1899\u20131901 period (i.e. just prior to the Blue Period) and 1904 can be considered a transition year between the two periods.\n\n[[File:GertrudeStein.JPG|thumb|left|upright|''Portrait of [[Gertrude Stein]]'', 1906, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York City. When someone commented that Stein did not look like her portrait, Picasso replied, \"She will\".<ref name=\"metmu2\"/>]]\n\nBy 1905, Picasso became a favourite of American art collectors [[Leo Stein|Leo]] and [[Gertrude Stein]]. Their older brother Michael Stein and his wife Sarah also became collectors of his work. Picasso painted portraits of both Gertrude Stein and her nephew [[Allan Stein]]. Gertrude Stein became Picasso's principal patron, acquiring his drawings and paintings and exhibiting them in her informal ''Salon'' at her home in Paris.<ref name=\"yale8\"/> At one of her gatherings in 1905, he met [[Henri Matisse]], who was to become a lifelong friend and rival. The Steins introduced him to [[Claribel Cone]] and her sister Etta who were American art collectors; they also began to acquire Picasso and Matisse's paintings. Eventually Leo Stein moved to Italy. Michael and Sarah Stein became patrons of Matisse, while Gertrude Stein continued to collect Picasso.<ref name=\"charm\"/>\n\nIn 1907, Picasso joined an art gallery that had recently been opened in Paris by [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]]. Kahnweiler was a German art historian and art collector who became one of the premier French art dealers of the 20th century. He was among the first champions of Pablo Picasso, [[Georges Braque]] and the [[Cubism]] that they jointly developed. Kahnweiler promoted burgeoning artists such as [[Andr\u00e9 Derain]], [[Kees van Dongen]], [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] and several others who had come from all over the globe to live and work in [[Montparnasse]] at the time.<ref name=\"tate7\"/>\n\n=== African art and primitivism: 1907\u20131909 ===\n[[File:Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' (1907), [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York]]\n{{See also|Picasso's African Period|Proto-Cubism}}\nPicasso's African-influenced Period (1907\u20131909) begins with his painting ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]''. Picasso painted this composition in a style inspired by [[Iberian sculpture]], but repainted the faces of the two figures on the right after being powerfully impressed by African artefacts he saw in June 1907 in the ethnographic museum at [[Palais du Trocad\u00e9ro]].<ref name=\"rube87\"/> When he displayed the painting to acquaintances in his studio later that year, the nearly universal reaction was shock and revulsion; Matisse angrily dismissed the work as a hoax.<ref name=\"pbsor\"/> Picasso did not exhibit ''Le Demoiselles'' publicly until 1916.\n\nOther works from this period include ''Nude with Raised Arms'' (1907) and ''Three Women'' (1908). Formal ideas developed during this period lead directly into the Cubist period that follows.\n\n=== Analytic cubism: 1909\u20131912 ===\nAnalytic [[cubism]] (1909\u20131912) is a style of painting Picasso developed with [[Georges Braque]] using monochrome brownish and neutral colours. Both artists took apart objects and \"analyzed\" them in terms of their shapes. Picasso and Braque's paintings at this time share many similarities.\n\nIn Paris, Picasso entertained a distinguished coterie of friends in the [[Montmartre]] and Montparnasse quarters, including [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]], poet [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], writer [[Alfred Jarry]] and Gertrude Stein. In 1911, Picasso was arrested and questioned about [[Mona Lisa#Refuge, theft and vandalism|the theft of the ''Mona Lisa'']] from the [[Louvre]]. Suspicion for the crime had initially fallen upon Apollinaire due to his links to G\u00e9ry Pieret, an artist with a history of thefts from the gallery. Apollinaire in turn implicated his close friend Picasso, who had also purchased stolen artworks from the artist in the past. Afraid of a conviction that could result in his deportation to Spain, Picasso denied having ever met Apollinaire. Both were later cleared of any involvement in the painting's disappearance.<ref name=\"thief\"/><ref name=\"TIME - 08Apr2009 - Art's Great Whodunit: The Mona Lisa Theft of 1911\"/>\n\n=== Synthetic cubism: 1912\u20131919 ===\n{{main|Crystal Cubism}}\n[[File:Pablo Picasso, summer 1912.jpg|thumb|upright|Picasso in front of his painting ''The Aficionado'' ([[Kunstmuseum Basel]]) at Villa les Clochettes, summer 1912]]\nSynthetic cubism (1912\u20131919) was a further development of the genre of cubism, in which cut paper fragments&nbsp;\u2013 often wallpaper or portions of newspaper pages&nbsp;\u2013 were pasted into compositions, marking the first use of [[collage]] in fine art.\n\nBetween 1915 and 1917, Picasso began a series of paintings depicting highly geometric and minimalist Cubist objects, consisting of either a pipe, a guitar or a glass, with an occasional element of collage. \"Hard-edged square-cut diamonds\", notes art historian [[John Richardson (art historian)|John Richardson]], \"these gems do not always have upside or downside\".<ref name=\"Richardson\"/><ref name=\"kahn18\"/> \"We need a new name to designate them,\" wrote Picasso to [[Gertrude Stein]]: Maurice Raynal suggested \"[[Crystal Cubism]]\".<ref name=\"Richardson\" /><ref name=\"moran143\"/> These \"little gems\" may have been produced by Picasso in response to critics who had claimed his defection from the movement, through his experimentation with classicism within the so-called [[return to order]] following the war.<ref name=\"Richardson\" /><ref name=\"Green, 1987\"/>\n\nAfter acquiring some fame and fortune, Picasso left Olivier for Marcelle Humbert, whom he called [[Eva Gouel]]. Picasso included declarations of his love for Eva in many Cubist works. Picasso was devastated by her premature death from illness at the age of 30 in 1915.<ref name=\"primi\"/>\n\nAt the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Picasso was living in [[Avignon]]. Braque and Derain were mobilized and Apollinaire joined the French artillery, while the Spaniard [[Juan Gris]] remained from the Cubist circle. During the war, Picasso was able to continue painting uninterrupted, unlike his French comrades. His paintings became more sombre and his life changed with dramatic consequences. Kahnweiler's contract had terminated on his exile from France. At this point Picasso's work would be taken on by the art dealer [[L\u00e9once Rosenberg]]. After the loss of Eva Gouel, Picasso had an affair with [[Gaby Lespinasse]]. During the spring of 1916, Apollinaire returned from the front wounded. They renewed their friendship, but Picasso began to frequent new social circles.<ref name=\"moma92\"/>\n\n[[File:Costume design by Pablo Picasso representing skyscrapers and boulevards, for Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes performance of Parade at Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet, Paris 18 May 1917.jpg|thumb|upright|Costume design by Pablo Picasso representing skyscrapers and boulevards, for [[Serge Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]] performance of ''[[Parade (ballet)|Parade]]'' at Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet, Paris 18 May 1917]]\n\n{{Further|Picasso and the Ballets Russes}}\n\nTowards the end of World War I, Picasso became involved with [[Serge Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]]. Among his friends during this period were [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Jean Hugo]], Juan Gris, and others. In the summer of 1918, Picasso married [[Olga Khokhlova]], a ballerina with Sergei Diaghilev's troupe, for whom Picasso was designing a ballet, Erik Satie's ''[[Parade (ballet)|Parade]]'', in Rome; they spent their honeymoon near [[Biarritz]] in the villa of glamorous Chilean art patron [[Eugenia Err\u00e1zuriz]].\n\n[[File:Pablo Picasso and scene painters sitting on the front cloth for Parade (Ballets Russes) at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet, Paris, 1917, Lachmann photographer.jpg|thumb|left|Pablo Picasso and scene painters sitting on the front cloth for [[L\u00e9onide Massine]]'s ballet ''Parade'', staged by [[Sergei Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]] at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet, Paris, 1917]]\n\nAfter returning from his honeymoon and in need of money, Picasso started his exclusive relationship with the French-Jewish art dealer [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]]. As part of his first duties, Rosenberg agreed to rent the couple an apartment in Paris at his own expense, which was located next to his own house. This was the start of a deep brother-like friendship between two very different men, that would last until the outbreak of World War II.\n\nKhokhlova introduced Picasso to high society, formal dinner parties, and other dimensions of the life of the rich in 1920s Paris. The two had a son, Paulo Picasso,<ref name=\"xtime\"/> who would grow up to be a motorcycle racer and chauffeur to his father. Khokhlova's insistence on social propriety clashed with Picasso's [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] tendencies and the two lived in a state of constant conflict. During the same period that Picasso collaborated with Diaghilev's troupe, he and [[Igor Stravinsky]] collaborated on ''[[Pulcinella (ballet)|Pulcinella]]'' in 1920. Picasso took the opportunity to make several drawings of the composer.<ref name=\"cubis\"/>\n\nIn 1927, Picasso met 17-year-old [[Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter]] and began a secret affair with her. Picasso's marriage to Khokhlova soon ended in separation rather than divorce, as French law required an even division of property in the case of divorce, and Picasso did not want Khokhlova to have half his wealth. The two remained legally married until Khokhlova's death in 1955. Picasso carried on a long-standing affair with Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter and fathered a daughter with her, named Maya. Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se lived in the vain hope that Picasso would one day marry her, and hanged herself four years after Picasso's death.\n{{-}}\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"180px\" class=\"center\">\nFile:Pablo Picasso, 1909, Femme assise (Sitzende Frau), oil on canvas, 100 x 80 cm, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Neue Nationalgalerie.jpg|1909, ''Femme assise (Sitzende Frau)'', oil on canvas, 100 \u00d7 80&nbsp;cm, [[Berlin State Museums|Staatliche Museen]], [[Neue Nationalgalerie]], Berlin\nFile:Pablo Picasso, 1909-10, Figure dans un Fauteuil (Seated Nude, Femme nue assise), oil on canvas, 92.1 x 73 cm, Tate Modern, London.jpg|1909\u201310, ''Figure dans un Fauteuil (Seated Nude, Femme nue assise)'', oil on canvas, 92.1 \u00d7 73&nbsp;cm, [[Tate Modern]], London.

This \"[[return to order]]\" is evident in the work of many European artists in the 1920s, including [[Andr\u00e9 Derain]], [[Giorgio de Chirico]], [[Gino Severini]], [[Jean Metzinger]], the artists of the [[New Objectivity]] movement and of the [[Novecento Italiano]] movement. Picasso's paintings and drawings from this period frequently recall the work of [[Raphael]] and [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]].\n\nIn 1925 the [[Surrealist]] writer and poet [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]] declared Picasso as 'one of ours' in his article ''Le Surr\u00e9alisme et la peinture'', published in ''R\u00e9volution surr\u00e9aliste''. ''Les Demoiselles'' was reproduced for the first time in Europe in the same issue. Yet Picasso exhibited Cubist works at the first Surrealist group exhibition in 1925; the concept of 'psychic automatism in its pure state' defined in the ''Manifeste du surr\u00e9alisme'' never appealed to him entirely. He did at the time develop new imagery and formal syntax for expressing himself emotionally, \"releasing the violence, the psychic fears and the eroticism that had been largely contained or sublimated since 1909\", writes art historian Melissa McQuillan.<ref name=\"MoMA\"/> Although this transition in Picasso's work was informed by Cubism for its spatial relations, \"the fusion of ritual and abandon in the imagery recalls the primitivism of the Demoiselles and the elusive psychological resonances of his Symbolist work\", writes McQuillan.<ref name=\"MoMA\" /> Surrealism revived Picasso's attraction to primitivism and eroticism.<ref name=\"MoMA\" />\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"180px\" class=\"center\">\nFile:Pablo Picasso, 1918, Pierrot, oil on canvas, 92.7 x 73 cm, Museum of Modern Art.jpg|Pablo Picasso, 1918, ''Pierrot'', oil on canvas, 92.7 \u00d7 73&nbsp;cm, [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York\nFile:Pablo Picasso, 1919, Sleeping Peasants, gouache, watercolor and pencil on paper, 31.1 x 48.9 cm, Museum of Modern Art, New York.jpg|Pablo Picasso, 1919, ''Sleeping Peasants'', gouache, watercolor and pencil on paper, 31.1 \u00d7 48.9&nbsp;cm, [[Museum of Modern Art]]\nFile:Pablo Picasso, 1917-18, Portrait d'Olga dans un fauteuil (Olga in an Armchair), oil on canvas, 130 x 88.8 cm, Mus\u00e9e Picasso, Paris, France.jpg|''Portrait d'Olga dans un fauteuil (Olga in an Armchair)'', 1918, [[Mus\u00e9e Picasso]], Paris, France\n</gallery>\n\n=== The Great Depression to MoMA exhibition: 1930\u20131939 ===\nDuring the 1930s, the [[minotaur]] replaced the [[harlequin]] as a common motif in his work. His use of the minotaur came partly from his contact with the surrealists, who often used it as their symbol, and it appears in Picasso's ''Guernica''. The minotaur and Picasso's mistress [[Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter]] are heavily featured in his celebrated ''[[Vollard Suite]]'' of etchings.<ref name='TelegMay12'/>\n\n[[File:PicassoGuernica.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'', 1937, [[Museo Reina Sofia]]]]\n\nArguably Picasso's most famous work is his depiction of the German [[bombing of Guernica]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]] \u2013 ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]''. This large canvas embodies for many the inhumanity, brutality and hopelessness of war. Asked to explain its symbolism, Picasso said, \"It isn't up to the painter to define the symbols. Otherwise it would be better if he wrote them out in so many words! The public who look at the picture must interpret the symbols as they understand them.\"<ref name=\"pbso4\"/><ref name=\"costa\"/> ''Guernica'' was exhibited in July 1937 at the Spanish Pavilion at the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|Paris International Exposition]], and then became the centerpiece of an exhibition of 118 works by Picasso, [[Matisse]], [[Braque]] and [[Henri Laurens]] that toured Scandinavia and England. After the victory of Francisco Franco in Spain, the painting was sent to the United States to raise funds and support for Spanish refugees. Until 1981 it was entrusted to the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City, as it was Picasso's expressed desire that the painting should not be delivered to Spain until liberty and democracy had been established in the country.\n\nIn 1939 and 1940, the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City, under its director [[Alfred Barr]], a Picasso enthusiast, held a major retrospective of Picasso's principal works until that time. This exhibition lionized the artist, brought into full public view in America the scope of his artistry, and resulted in a reinterpretation of his work by contemporary art historians and scholars.<ref name=\"marke\"/> According to Jonathan Weinberg, \"Given the extraordinary quality of the show and Picasso's enormous prestige, generally heightened by the political impact of ''Guernica'' ... the critics were surprisingly ambivalent\".<ref name=\"Weinberg_33\"/> Picasso's \"multiplicity of styles\" was disturbing to one journalist, another described the artist as \"wayward and even malicious\"; [[Alfred Frankenstein]]'s review in ''[[ARTnews]]'' concluded that Picasso was both charlatan and genius.<ref name=\"Weinberg_33\"/>\n{{-}}\n\n=== World War II and late 1940s: 1939\u20131949 ===\n\n[[File:Pablo Picasso in NMW.jpg|thumb|left|[[Stanis\u0142aw Lorentz]] guides Pablo Picasso through the [[National Museum in Warsaw]] in Poland during exhibition ''Contemporary French Painters and Pablo Picasso's Ceramics'', 1948.

Picasso's artistic style did not fit the [[Nazi art|Nazi ideal of art]], so he did not exhibit during this time. He was often harassed by the [[Gestapo]]. During one search of his apartment, an officer saw a photograph of the painting ''Guernica''. \"Did you do that?\" the German asked Picasso. \"No,\" he replied, \"You did\".<ref name=\"Regan25\"/>\n\nRetreating to his studio, he continued to paint, producing works such as the ''Still Life with Guitar'' (1942) and ''[[The Charnel House]]'' (1944\u201348).<ref name=\"blogs\"/> Although the Germans outlawed [[bronze]] casting in Paris, Picasso continued regardless, using bronze smuggled to him by the [[French Resistance]].<ref name=\"artn3\"/>\n\nAround this time, [[Picasso's poetry|Picasso wrote poetry]] as an alternative outlet. Between 1935 and 1959 he wrote over 300 poems. Largely untitled except for a date and sometimes the location of where it was written (for example \"Paris 16 May 1936\"), these works were gustatory, erotic and at times [[Scatology#Literature|scatological]], as were his two full-length plays ''[[Desire Caught by the Tail]]'' (1941) and ''[[The Four Little Girls]]'' (1949).<ref name=\"orgaz\"/><ref name=\"blogs7\"/>\n\nIn 1944, after the liberation of Paris, Picasso, then 63 years old, began a romantic relationship with a young art student named [[Fran\u00e7oise Gilot]]. She was 40 years younger than he was. Picasso grew tired of his mistress [[Dora Maar]]; Picasso and Gilot began to live together. Eventually they had two children: [[Claude Picasso]], born in 1947 and [[Paloma Picasso]], born in 1949. In her 1964 book ''Life with Picasso'',<ref name=\"life6\"/> Gilot describes his abusive treatment and myriad [[infidelities]] which led her to leave him, taking the children with her. This was a severe blow to Picasso.\n\n[[File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Milano, 1953) - BEIC 6356204.jpg|thumb|upright|Pablo Picasso photographed in 1953 by [[Paolo Monti]] during an exhibition at [[Royal Palace of Milan|Palazzo Reale]] in Milan (Fondo Paolo Monti, [[Biblioteca europea di informazione e cultura|BEIC]]).]]\n\nPicasso had affairs with women of an even greater age disparity than his and Gilot's. While still involved with Gilot, in 1951 Picasso had a six-week affair with [[Genevi\u00e8ve Laporte]], who was four years younger than Gilot. By his 70s, many paintings, ink drawings and prints have as their theme an old, grotesque dwarf as the doting lover of a beautiful young model. [[Jacqueline Roque]] (1927\u20131986) worked at the Madoura Pottery in [[Vallauris]] on the [[French Riviera]], where Picasso made and painted ceramics. She became his lover, and then his second wife in 1961. The two were together for the remainder of Picasso's life.\n\nHis marriage to Roque was also a means of revenge against Gilot; with Picasso's encouragement, Gilot had divorced her then husband, Luc Simon, with the plan to marry Picasso to secure the rights of her children as Picasso's legitimate heirs. Picasso had already secretly married Roque, after Gilot had filed for divorce. His strained relationship with Claude and Paloma was never healed.<ref name=\"expre\"/>\n\nBy this time, Picasso had constructed a huge [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] home, and could afford large villas in the south of France, such as Mas Notre-Dame-de-Vie on the outskirts of [[Mougins]], and in the [[Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur]]. He was an international celebrity, with often as much interest in his personal life as his art.<ref name=\"chess\"/>\n\n=== Later works to final years: 1949\u20131973 ===\n[[File:2004-09-07 1800x2400 chicago picasso.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The ''[[Chicago Picasso]]'', a 50-foot high public [[Cubist sculpture]]. Donated by Picasso to the people of Chicago]]\n\nPicasso was one of 250 sculptors who exhibited in the [[3rd Sculpture International]] held at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] in mid-1949. In the 1950s, Picasso's style changed once again, as he took to producing reinterpretations of the art of the great masters. He made a [[Las Meninas (Picasso)|series]] of works based on [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez|Vel\u00e1zquez]]'s painting of ''[[Las Meninas]]''. He also based paintings on works by [[Francisco Goya|Goya]], [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin]], [[\u00c9douard Manet|Manet]], [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]] and [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix|Delacroix]].\n\nIn addition to his artistic accomplishments, Picasso made a few film appearances, always as himself, including a cameo in Jean Cocteau's ''[[Testament of Orpheus]]'' (1960). In 1955, he helped make the film ''Le Myst\u00e8re Picasso'' (''[[The Mystery of Picasso]]'') directed by [[Henri-Georges Clouzot]].\n[[File:Pablo picasso 1.jpg|thumb|left|alt=An elderly Pablo Picasso in a cloth cap, grinning at the camera|upright|Picasso in 1962]]\nHe was commissioned to make a [[maquette]] for a huge {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}}-high [[public art|public sculpture]] to be built in Chicago, known usually as the ''[[Chicago Picasso]]''. He approached the project with a great deal of enthusiasm, designing a sculpture which was ambiguous and somewhat controversial. What the figure represents is not known; it could be a bird, a horse, a woman or a totally abstract shape. The sculpture, one of the most recognizable landmarks in downtown Chicago, was unveiled in 1967. Picasso refused to be paid $100,000 for it, donating it to the people of the city.\n\nPicasso's final works were a mixture of styles, his means of expression in constant flux until the end of his life. Devoting his full energies to his work, Picasso became more daring, his works more colourful and expressive, and from 1968 to 1971 he produced a torrent of paintings and hundreds of copperplate etchings. At the time these works were dismissed by most as pornographic fantasies of an impotent old man or the slapdash works of an artist who was past his prime.<ref name=\"wort472\"/><ref name=\"late0\"/> Only later, after Picasso's death, when the rest of the art world had moved on from [[abstract expressionism]], did the critical community come to see the late works of Picasso as prefiguring [[Neo-Expressionism]].<ref name=\"late3\"/>\n\nPablo Picasso died on 8 April 1973 in [[Mougins]], France from [[pulmonary edema]] and heart failure, while he and his wife Jacqueline entertained friends for dinner. He was interred at the [[Ch\u00e2teau of Vauvenargues]] near [[Aix-en-Provence]], a property he had acquired in 1958 and occupied with Jacqueline between 1959 and 1962. Jacqueline Roque prevented his children Claude and Paloma from attending the funeral.<ref name=\"riche\"/> Devastated and lonely after the death of Picasso, Jacqueline Roque killed herself by gunshot in 1986 when she was 59 years old.<ref name=\"famil\"/>\n\n== Political views ==\n[[File:Picasso Massacre in Korea.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|''[[Massacre in Korea]]'', 1951]]\n\nPicasso remained aloof from the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] independence movement during his youth despite expressing general support and being friendly with activists within it. He did not join the armed forces for any side or country during World War I, the [[Spanish Civil War]], and World War II. As a Spanish citizen living in France, Picasso was under no compulsion to fight against the invading Germans in either world war. However, in 1940, he did apply for French citizenship, but it was refused on the grounds of his \"extremist ideas evolving towards communism\". This information was not revealed until 2003.<ref name=\"smhc5\"/>\n\nAt the start of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, Picasso was 54 years of age. Soon after hostilities began, the Republicans appointed him \"director of the Prado, albeit in absentia\", and \"he took his duties very seriously\", according to John Richardson, supplying the funds to evacuate the museum's collection to Geneva.<ref name=\"Richardson_NYRB_25November2010\"/> The war provided the impetus for Picasso's first overtly [[The arts and politics|political work]]. He expressed anger and condemnation of [[Francisco Franco]] and fascists in ''[[The Dream and Lie of Franco]]'' (1937), which was produced \"specifically for propagandistic and fundraising purposes\".<ref name=\"pbs\" /> This surreal fusion of words and images was intended to be sold as a series of postcards to raise funds for the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Spanish Republican cause]].<ref name=\"pbs\"/><ref name=\"ngv\"/>\n\nIn 1944, Picasso joined the [[French Communist Party]], attended the [[World Congress of Intellectuals in Defense of Peace]] in Poland, and in 1950 received the [[Stalin Peace Prize]] from the Soviet government.<ref name=\"artn23\"/> Party criticism in 1953 of his portrait of [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] as insufficiently realistic cooled Picasso's interest in Soviet politics, though he remained a loyal member of the Communist Party until his death.<ref name=\"Richardson_NYRB_25November2010\"/> His dealer, [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler|D-H. Kahnweiler]], a socialist, termed Picasso's communism \"sentimental\" rather than political, saying \"He has never read a line of Karl Marx, nor of Engels of course.\"<ref name=\"Richardson_NYRB_25November2010\"/> In a 1945 interview with Jerome Seckler, Picasso stated: \"I am a Communist and my painting is Communist painting. ... But if I were a shoemaker, Royalist or Communist or anything else, I would not necessarily hammer my shoes in a special way to show my politics.\"<ref name=\"selec\"/> His commitment to communism, common among [[Continental Europe|continental]] intellectuals and artists at the time, has long been the subject of some controversy; a notable demonstration thereof was a quote commonly attributed to [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]] (with whom Picasso had a rather strained relationship<ref name=\"larep\"/>):\n: '' Picasso es pintor, yo tambi\u00e9n; [...] Picasso es espa\u00f1ol, yo tambi\u00e9n; Picasso es comunista, yo tampoco.''\n:(Picasso is a painter, so am I; [...] Picasso is a Spaniard, so am I; Picasso is a communist, neither am I.)<ref name=\"monog\"/><ref name=\"elmun\"/><ref name=\"peace\"/>\n\nIn the late 1940s, his old friend the [[surrealist]] poet and [[Leon Trosky|Trotskyist]]<ref name=\"alang\"/> and anti-Stalinist [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]] was more blunt; refusing to shake hands with Picasso, he told him: \"I don't approve of your joining the Communist Party nor with the stand you have taken concerning the purges of the intellectuals after the Liberation\".<ref name=\"destr\"/>\nPicasso was against the intervention of the United Nations and the United States in the [[Korean War]] and he depicted it in ''[[Massacre in Korea]]''.<ref name=\"afte15\"/><ref name=\"retro\"/> The art critic Kirsten Hoving Keen says that it is \"inspired by reports of American atrocities\" and considers it one of Picasso's communist works.<ref name=\"commu464\"/>\n\nIn 1962, he received the [[Lenin Peace Prize]].<ref name=\"stali\"/> Biographer and art critic [[John Berger]] felt his talents as an artist were \"wasted\" by the communists.<ref name=\"fail05\"/> According to Jean Cocteau's diaries, Picasso once said to him in reference to the communists: \"I have joined a family, and like all families, it's full of shit\".<ref name=\"guar50\"/>\n\n== Style and technique ==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | header =\n | header_align = left/right/center\n | header_background =\n | footer =\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background =\n | width =\n | image1 = Pablo Picasso, 1901, Old Woman (Woman with Gloves), oil on cardboard, 67 x 52.1 cm, Philadelphia Museum of Art.jpg\n | width1 = 160\n | caption1 = Pablo Picasso, 1901, ''Old Woman (Woman with Gloves)'', oil on cardboard, 67 \u00d7 52.1&nbsp;cm, [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]\n | image2 = Pablo Picasso, 1901-02, Femme au caf\u00e9 (Absinthe Drinker), oil on canvas, 73 x 54 cm, Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg, Russia.jpg\n | width2 = 152\n | caption2 = Pablo Picasso, 1901\u201302, ''Femme au caf\u00e9 (Absinthe Drinker)'', oil on canvas, 73 \u00d7 54 cm, [[Hermitage Museum]]\n}}\n<!--[[File:Pablo Picasso, 1901, Old Woman (Woman with Gloves), oil on cardboard, 67 x 52.1 cm, Philadelphia Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|Pablo Picasso, 1901, ''Old Woman (Woman with Gloves)'', oil on cardboard, 67 \u00d7 52.1&nbsp;cm, [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]]]\n[[File:Pablo Picasso, 1901-02, Femme au caf\u00e9 (Absinthe Drinker), oil on canvas, 73 x 54 cm, Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg, Russia.jpg|thumb|Pablo Picasso, 1901\u201302, ''Femme au caf\u00e9 (Absinthe Drinker)'', oil on canvas, 73 \u00d7 54 cm, [[Hermitage Museum]], Saint Petersburg, Russia]]-->\n\nPicasso was exceptionally prolific throughout his long lifetime. The total number of artworks he produced has been estimated at 50,000, comprising 1,885 paintings; 1,228 sculptures; 2,880 ceramics, roughly 12,000 drawings, many thousands of prints, and numerous tapestries and rugs.<ref name=\"gelon\"/>\n\nThe medium in which Picasso made his most important contribution was painting.<ref name=\"McQuillan\"/> In his paintings, Picasso used colour as an expressive element, but relied on drawing rather than subtleties of colour to create form and space.<ref name=\"McQuillan\"/> He sometimes added sand to his paint to vary its texture. A [[nanoprobe (device)|nanoprobe]] of Picasso's ''The Red Armchair'' (1931) by physicists at [[Argonne National Laboratory]] in 2012 confirmed art historians' belief that Picasso used common house paint in many of his paintings.<ref>Moskowitz, Clara (8 February 2013). [http://www.livescience.com/26963-picasso-house-paint-x-rays.html \"Picasso's Genius Revealed: He Used Common House Paint\"], Live Science. Retrieved 9 February 2013.</ref> Much of his painting was done at night by artificial light.\n\nPicasso's early sculptures were carved from wood or modelled in wax or clay, but from 1909 to 1928 Picasso abandoned modelling and instead made sculptural constructions using diverse materials.<ref name=\"McQuillan\"/> An example is ''Guitar'' (1912), a relief construction made of sheet metal and wire that Jane Fluegel terms a \"three-dimensional planar counterpart of Cubist painting\" that marks a \"revolutionary departure from the traditional approaches, modeling and carving\".<ref name=\"rube150\"/>\n\n[[File:Pablo Picasso, 1921, Nous autres musiciens (Three Musicians), oil on canvas, 204.5 x 188.3 cm, Philadelphia Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|Pablo Picasso, 1921, ''Nous autres musiciens (Three Musicians)'', oil on canvas, 204.5 x 188.3&nbsp;cm, [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]]]\nFrom the beginning of his career, Picasso displayed an interest in subject matter of every kind,<ref name=\"cirl164\"/> and demonstrated a great stylistic versatility that enabled him to work in several styles at once. For example, his paintings of 1917 included the [[pointillist]] ''Woman with a Mantilla'', the Cubist ''Figure in an Armchair'', and the naturalistic ''Harlequin'' (all in the [[Museu Picasso]], Barcelona). In 1919, he made a number of drawings from postcards and photographs that reflect his interest in the stylistic conventions and static character of posed photographs.<ref name=\"Cowling&Mundy_208\"/> In 1921 he simultaneously painted several large neoclassical paintings and two versions of the Cubist composition ''[[Three Musicians]]'' (Museum of Modern Art, New York; Philadelphia Museum of Art).<ref name=\"Cowling&Mundy_201\"/> In an interview published in 1923, Picasso said, \"The several manners I have used in my art must not be considered as an evolution, or as steps towards an unknown ideal of painting ... If the subjects I have wanted to express have suggested different ways of expression I have never hesitated to adopt them.\"<ref name=\"Cowling&Mundy_201\"/>\n\nAlthough his Cubist works approach abstraction, Picasso never relinquished the objects of the real world as subject matter. Prominent in his Cubist paintings are forms easily recognized as guitars, violins, and bottles.<ref name=\"cirl158\"/> When Picasso depicted complex narrative scenes it was usually in prints, drawings, and small-scale works; ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' (1937) is one of his few large narrative paintings.<ref name=\"Cowling&Mundy_208\"/>\n\nPicasso painted mostly from imagination or memory. According to [[William Rubin]], Picasso \"could only make great art from subjects that truly involved him ... Unlike Matisse, Picasso had eschewed models virtually all his mature life, preferring to paint individuals whose lives had both impinged on, and had real significance for, his own.\"<ref name=\"Danto_1996\"/> The art critic [[Arthur Danto]] said Picasso's work constitutes a \"vast pictorial autobiography\" that provides some basis for the popular conception that \"Picasso invented a new style each time he fell in love with a new woman\".<ref name=\"Danto_1996\"/> The autobiographical nature of Picasso's art is reinforced by his habit of dating his works, often to the day. He explained: \"I want to leave to posterity a documentation that will be as complete as possible. That's why I put a date on everything I do.\"<ref name=\"Danto_1996\"/>\n\n== Artistic legacy ==\n[[File:Stamp P.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Postage stamp, USSR, 1973. Picasso has been honoured on stamps worldwide.]]\n\nPicasso's influence was and remains immense and widely acknowledged by his admirers and detractors alike. On the occasion of his 1939 retrospective at MoMA, ''Life'' magazine wrote: \"During the 25 years he has dominated modern European art, his enemies say he has been a corrupting influence. With equal violence, his friends say he is the greatest artist alive.\"<ref name=\"spani\"/> In 1998, [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] wrote of him: \"To say that Pablo Picasso dominated Western art in the 20th century is, by now, the merest commonplace. ... No painter or sculptor, not even Michelangelo, had been as famous as this in his own lifetime. ... Though [[Marcel Duchamp]], that cunning old fox of conceptual irony, has certainly had more influence on nominally vanguard art over the past 30 years than Picasso, the Spaniard was the last great beneficiary of the belief that the language of painting and sculpture really mattered to people other than their devotees.\"<ref name=\"time82\"/>\n\n[[File:HotelSale hinten.JPG|thumb|right|[[Mus\u00e9e Picasso]], Paris (Hotel Sal\u00e9, 1659)]]\n\nAt the time of Picasso's death many of his paintings were in his possession, as he had kept off the art market what he did not need to sell. In addition, Picasso had a considerable collection of the work of other famous artists, some his contemporaries, such as [[Henri Matisse]], with whom he had exchanged works. Since Picasso left no will, his death duties (estate tax) to the French state were paid in the form of his works and others from his collection. These works form the core of the immense and representative collection of the [[Mus\u00e9e Picasso]] in Paris. In 2003, relatives of Picasso inaugurated a museum dedicated to him in his birthplace, M\u00e1laga, Spain, the [[Museo Picasso M\u00e1laga]].\n\n[[File:Museu Picasso Barcelona.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Museu Picasso]] is located in the [[Catalan Gothic|gothic]] palaces of Montcada street in [[Barcelona]]]]\n\nThe [[Museu Picasso]] in Barcelona features many of his early works, created while he was living in Spain, including many rarely seen works which reveal his firm grounding in classical techniques. The museum also holds many precise and detailed figure studies done in his youth under his father's tutelage, as well as the extensive collection of Jaime Sabart\u00e9s, his close friend and personal secretary.\n\n''Guernica'' was on display in New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]] for many years. In 1981, it was returned to Spain and was on exhibit at the [[Cas\u00f3n del Buen Retiro]] of the [[Museo del Prado]]. In 1992, the painting was put on display in Madrid's [[Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda|Reina Sof\u00eda Museum]] when it opened.\n\nIn the 1996 movie ''[[Surviving Picasso]]'', Picasso is portrayed by actor [[Anthony Hopkins]].<ref name=\"imdb4\"/> Picasso is also a character in [[Steve Martin]]'s 1993 play, ''[[Picasso at the Lapin Agile]]''. In ''[[A Moveable Feast]]'' by [[Ernest Hemingway]], Hemingway tells [[Gertrude Stein]] that he would like to have some Picassos, but cannot afford them. Later in the book, Hemingway mentions looking at one of Picasso's paintings. He refers to it as Picasso's nude of the girl with the basket of flowers, possibly related to ''Young Naked Girl with Flower Basket''.\n\n[[File:Art Museum Pablo Picasso M\u00fcnster Arkaden.jpg|thumb|right|Art Museum Pablo Picasso [[M\u00fcnster]] Arkaden]]\n\nOn 8 October 2010, ''Picasso: Masterpieces from the Mus\u00e9e National Picasso, Paris,'' an exhibition of 150 paintings, sculptures, drawings, prints and photographs from the Mus\u00e9e National Picasso in Paris, opened at the [[Seattle Art Museum]], [[Seattle]], Washington, US.

Picasso was married twice and had four children by three women:\n* Paulo (4 February 1921 \u2013 5 June 1975, Paul Joseph Picasso) \u2013 with [[Olga Khokhlova]]\n* [[Maya Widmaier-Picasso|Maya]] (born 5 September 1935, Maria de la Concepcion Picasso) \u2013 with [[Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter]]\n* [[Claude Picasso|Claude]] (born 15 May 1947, Claude Pierre Pablo Picasso) \u2013 with [[Fran\u00e7oise Gilot]]\n* [[Paloma Picasso|Paloma]] (born 19 April 1949, Anne Paloma Picasso) \u2013 with Fran\u00e7oise Gilot\n\nPhotographer and painter [[Dora Maar]] was also a constant companion and lover of Picasso. The two were closest in the late 1930s and early 1940s, and it was Maar who documented the painting of ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]''.\n\n== Catalogue raisonn\u00e9 ==\nPicasso entrusted [[Christian Zervos]] to constitute the [[catalogue raisonn\u00e9]] of his work (painted and drawn). The first volume of the catalog, ''Works from 1895 to 1906'', published in 1932, entailed the financial ruin of Zervos, self-publishing under the name ''[[Cahiers d'art]]'', forcing him to sell part of his art collection at auction to avoid bankruptcy.<ref name=\"sale1\"/><ref name=\"uabca\"/>\n\nFrom 1932 to 1978, Zervos constituted the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of the complete works of Picasso in the company of the artist who had become one of his friends in 1924. Following the death of Zervos, Mila Gagarin supervised the publication of 11 additional volumes from 1970 to 1978.<ref name=\"PER00449b68b92455f2\"/>\n\nThe 33 volumes cover the entire work from 1895 to 1972, with close to 16,000 black and white photographs, in accord with the will of the artist.<ref name=\"nytimes\"/>\n* 1932: tome I, ''\u0152uvres de 1895 \u00e0 1906''.

Regarded as one of the most influential artists of the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the [[Cubist]] movement, the invention of [[Assemblage (art)|constructed sculpture]],<ref name=\"moma4\"/><ref name=\"tate1\"/> the co-invention of [[collage]], and for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore. Among his most famous works are the [[Proto-Cubism|proto-Cubist]] ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' (1907), and ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' (1937), a dramatic portrayal of the [[bombing of Guernica]] by the German and Italian airforces during the [[Spanish Civil War]].\n\nPicasso demonstrated extraordinary artistic talent in his early years, painting in a naturalistic manner through his childhood and adolescence. During the first decade of the 20th century, his style changed as he experimented with different theories, techniques, and ideas. After 1906, the [[Fauvist]] work of the slightly older artist [[Henri Matisse]] motivated Picasso to explore more radical styles, beginning a fruitful rivalry between the two artists, who subsequently were often paired by critics as the leaders of modern art.<ref name=\"tate0\"/><ref name=\"fran5\"/><ref name=\"guar6\"/><ref name=\"k12ok\"/>\n\nPicasso's work is often categorized into periods. While the names of many of his later periods are debated, the most commonly accepted periods in his work are the [[Picasso's Blue Period|Blue Period]] (1901\u20131904), the [[Picasso's Rose Period|Rose Period]] (1904\u20131906), the [[Picasso's African Period|African-influenced Period]] (1907\u20131909), Analytic [[Cubism]] (1909\u20131912), and Synthetic Cubism (1912\u20131919), also referred to as the [[Crystal Cubism|Crystal period]]. Much of Picasso's work of the late 1910s and early 1920s is in a [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] style, and his work in the mid-1920s often has characteristics of [[Surrealism]]. His later work often combines elements of his earlier styles.\n\nExceptionally prolific throughout the course of his long life, Picasso achieved universal renown and immense fortune for his revolutionary artistic accomplishments, and became one of the best-known figures in [[20th-century art]].\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Pablo Picasso with his sister Lola, 1889.jpg|thumb|upright|Pablo Picasso with his sister Lola, 1889]]\nPicasso was baptized '''Pablo Diego Jos\u00e9 Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno Mar\u00eda de los Remedios Cipriano de la Sant\u00edsima Trinidad Ruiz y Picasso''',<ref name=\"CatRez\"/> a series of names honouring various saints and relatives.<ref name=\"shsu5\"/> ''Ruiz y Picasso'' were included for his father and mother, respectively, as per Spanish tradition. Born in the city of [[M\u00e1laga]] in the [[Andalusia]]n region of Spain, he was the first child of [[Jos\u00e9 Ruiz y Blasco|Don Jos\u00e9 Ruiz y Blasco]] (1838\u20131913) and Mar\u00eda Picasso y L\u00f3pez.<ref name=\"collier\"/> Though baptized a Catholic, Picasso would later become an atheist.<ref name=\"thepi\"/>\n\nThe surname \"Picasso\" comes from [[Liguria]], a coastal region of north-western Italy; its capital is [[Genoa]].<ref name=\"Fundaci\u00f3n Picasso\"/> There was a painter from the area named {{Interlanguage link|Matteo Picasso|fr}} (1794\u20131879), born in Recco (Genoa), of late neoclassical style portraiture,<ref name=\"Fundaci\u00f3n Picasso\" /> though investigations have not definitively determined his kinship with the branch of ancestors related to Pablo Picasso. The direct branch from [[Sori, Liguria]] (Genoa), can be traced back to Tommaso Picasso (1728\u20131813). His son Giovanni Battista, married to Isabella Musante, was Pablo's great-great-grandfather. Of this marriage was born Tommaso (Sori, 1787\u2013M\u00e1laga, 1851). Pablo's maternal great-grandfather, Tommaso Picasso moved to Spain around 1807.<ref name=\"Fundaci\u00f3n Picasso\" />\n\nPicasso's family was of middle-class background. His father was a painter who specialized in naturalistic depictions of birds and other game. For most of his life Ruiz was a professor of art at the School of Crafts and a [[curator]] of a local museum. Ruiz's ancestors were minor aristocrats.\n\nPicasso showed a passion and a skill for drawing from an early age. According to his mother, his first words were \"piz, piz\", a shortening of ''l\u00e1piz'', the Spanish word for \"pencil\".<ref name=\"Wert9\"/> From the age of seven, Picasso received formal artistic training from his father in figure drawing and oil painting. Ruiz was a traditional academic artist and instructor, who believed that proper training required disciplined copying of the masters, and drawing the human body from plaster casts and live models. His son became preoccupied with art to the detriment of his classwork.\n\nThe family moved to [[A Coru\u00f1a]] in 1891, where his father became a professor at the School of Fine Arts. They stayed almost four years. On one occasion, the father found his son painting over his unfinished sketch of a pigeon. Observing the precision of his son's technique, an [[apocrypha]]l story relates, Ruiz felt that the thirteen-year-old Picasso had surpassed him, and vowed to give up painting,<ref name=\"wert11\"/> though paintings by him exist from later years.\n\nIn 1895, Picasso was traumatized when his seven-year-old sister, Conchita, died of [[diphtheria]].<ref name=\"theatlantic.com\"/> After her death, the family moved to [[Barcelona]], where Ruiz took a position at its School of Fine Arts. Picasso thrived in the city, regarding it in times of sadness or nostalgia as his true home.<ref name=\"w13\"/> Ruiz persuaded the officials at the academy to allow his son to take an entrance exam for the advanced class. This process often took students a month, but Picasso completed it in a week, and the jury admitted him, at just 13. As a student, Picasso lacked discipline but made friendships that would affect him in later life. His father rented a small room for him close to home so he could work alone, yet he checked up on him numerous times a day, judging his drawings. The two argued frequently.<ref name=\"caval\"/>\n\nPicasso's father and uncle decided to send the young artist to Madrid's [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando]], the country's foremost art school.<ref name=\"w13\"/> At age 16, Picasso set off for the first time on his own, but he disliked formal instruction and stopped attending classes soon after enrollment. Madrid held many other attractions. The [[Prado]] housed paintings by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], [[Francisco Goya]], and [[Francisco Zurbar\u00e1n]]. Picasso especially admired the works of [[El Greco]]; elements such as his elongated limbs, arresting colours, and mystical visages are echoed in Picasso's later work.<ref name=\"propos\"/>\n{{-}}\n\n== Career ==\n=== Before 1900 ===\n[[File:Pablo Picasso, 1904, Paris, photograph by Ricard Canals i Llamb\u00ed.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Picasso in 1904. Photograph by [[Ricard Canals]].]]\nPicasso's training under his father began before 1890. His progress can be traced in the collection of early works now held by the [[Museu Picasso]]<!--MUSEU is not a typo--> in Barcelona, which provides one of the most comprehensive records extant of any major artist's beginnings.<ref name=\"cirl6\"/> During 1893 the juvenile quality of his earliest work falls away, and by 1894 his career as a painter can be said to have begun.<ref name=\"cirl14\"/> The academic realism apparent in the works of the mid-1890s is well displayed in ''The First Communion'' (1896), a large composition that depicts his sister, Lola. In the same year, at the age of 14, he painted ''Portrait of Aunt Pepa'', a vigorous and dramatic portrait that Juan-Eduardo Cirlot has called \"without a doubt one of the greatest in the whole history of Spanish painting.\"<ref name=\"cirl37\"/>\n\nIn 1897, his realism began to show a [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] influence, for example, in a series of landscape paintings rendered in non-naturalistic violet and green tones. What some call his Modernist period (1899\u20131900) followed. His exposure to the work of [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti|Rossetti]], [[Th\u00e9ophile Steinlen|Steinlen]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec|Toulouse-Lautrec]] and [[Edvard Munch]], combined with his admiration for favourite old masters such as [[El Greco]], led Picasso to a personal version of modernism in his works of this period.<ref name=\"cirl87\"/>\n\nPicasso made his first trip to [[Paris]], then the art capital of Europe, in 1900. There, he met his first Parisian friend, journalist and poet [[Max Jacob]], who helped Picasso learn the language and its literature. Soon they shared an apartment; Max slept at night while Picasso slept during the day and worked at night. These were times of severe poverty, cold, and desperation. Much of his work was burned to keep the small room warm. During the first five months of 1901, Picasso lived in Madrid, where he and his [[anarchist]] friend Francisco de As\u00eds Soler founded the magazine ''Arte Joven'' (''Young Art''), which published five issues. Soler solicited articles and Picasso illustrated the journal, mostly contributing grim cartoons depicting and sympathizing with the state of the poor. The first issue was published on 31 March 1901, by which time the artist had started to sign his work ''Picasso''.<ref name=\"cirl125\"/> From 1898 he signed his works as \"Pablo Ruiz Picasso\", then as \"Pablo R. Picasso\" until 1901. The change does not seem to imply a rejection of the father figure. Rather, he wanted to distinguish himself from others; initiated by his Catalan friends who habitually called him by his maternal surname, much less current than the paternal Ruiz.<ref>Fermigier, Andr\u00e9 (1969).

In his austere use of colour and sometimes doleful subject matter \u2013 prostitutes and beggars are frequent subjects \u2013 Picasso was influenced by a trip through Spain and by the suicide of his friend [[Carles Casagemas]]. Starting in autumn of 1901 he painted several posthumous portraits of Casagemas, culminating in the gloomy allegorical painting ''La Vie'' (1903), now in the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]].<ref name=\"watte\"/>\n\nThe same mood pervades the well-known etching ''The Frugal Repast'' (1904),<ref name=\"metmu\"/> which depicts a blind man and a sighted woman, both emaciated, seated at a nearly bare table. Blindness is a recurrent theme in Picasso's works of this period, also represented in ''The Blindman's Meal'' (1903, the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]) and in the portrait of ''Celestina'' (1903). Other Blue Period works include ''Portrait of Soler'' and ''[[Portrait of Suzanne Bloch]]''.\n\n=== Rose Period: 1904\u20131906 ===\n{{details|Picasso's Rose Period}}\n\n[[File:Pablo Picasso, 1905, Au Lapin Agile (At the Lapin Agile), oil on canvas, 99.1 x 100.3 cm, Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|Pablo Picasso, 1905, ''Au Lapin Agile'' (''At the Lapin Agile'') (''Arlequin tenant un verre''), oil on canvas, 99.1 \u00d7 100.3&nbsp;cm, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]\nThe Rose Period (1904\u20131906)<ref name=\"Watte194\"/> is characterized by a lighter tone and style utilizing orange and pink colours, and featuring many circus people, [[Family of Acrobats (study)|acrobats]] and [[harlequin]]s known in France as saltimbanques. The harlequin, a comedic character usually depicted in checkered patterned clothing, became a personal symbol for Picasso. Picasso met [[Fernande Olivier]], a [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] artist who became his mistress, in Paris in 1904.<ref name=\"theatlantic.com\"/> Olivier appears in many of his Rose Period paintings, many of which are influenced by his warm relationship with her, in addition to his increased exposure to French painting. The generally upbeat and optimistic mood of paintings in this period is reminiscent of the 1899\u20131901 period (i.e. just prior to the Blue Period) and 1904 can be considered a transition year between the two periods.\n\n[[File:GertrudeStein.JPG|thumb|left|upright|''Portrait of [[Gertrude Stein]]'', 1906, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York City. When someone commented that Stein did not look like her portrait, Picasso replied, \"She will\".<ref name=\"metmu2\"/>]]\n\nBy 1905, Picasso became a favourite of American art collectors [[Leo Stein|Leo]] and [[Gertrude Stein]]. Their older brother Michael Stein and his wife Sarah also became collectors of his work. Picasso painted portraits of both Gertrude Stein and her nephew [[Allan Stein]]. Gertrude Stein became Picasso's principal patron, acquiring his drawings and paintings and exhibiting them in her informal ''Salon'' at her home in Paris.<ref name=\"yale8\"/> At one of her gatherings in 1905, he met [[Henri Matisse]], who was to become a lifelong friend and rival. The Steins introduced him to [[Claribel Cone]] and her sister Etta who were American art collectors; they also began to acquire Picasso and Matisse's paintings. Eventually Leo Stein moved to Italy. Michael and Sarah Stein became patrons of Matisse, while Gertrude Stein continued to collect Picasso.<ref name=\"charm\"/>\n\nIn 1907, Picasso joined an art gallery that had recently been opened in Paris by [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]]. Kahnweiler was a German art historian and art collector who became one of the premier French art dealers of the 20th century. He was among the first champions of Pablo Picasso, [[Georges Braque]] and the [[Cubism]] that they jointly developed. Kahnweiler promoted burgeoning artists such as [[Andr\u00e9 Derain]], [[Kees van Dongen]], [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] and several others who had come from all over the globe to live and work in [[Montparnasse]] at the time.<ref name=\"tate7\"/>\n\n=== African art and primitivism: 1907\u20131909 ===\n[[File:Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' (1907), [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York]]\n{{See also|Picasso's African Period|Proto-Cubism}}\nPicasso's African-influenced Period (1907\u20131909) begins with his painting ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]''. Picasso painted this composition in a style inspired by [[Iberian sculpture]], but repainted the faces of the two figures on the right after being powerfully impressed by African artefacts he saw in June 1907 in the ethnographic museum at [[Palais du Trocad\u00e9ro]].<ref name=\"rube87\"/> When he displayed the painting to acquaintances in his studio later that year, the nearly universal reaction was shock and revulsion; Matisse angrily dismissed the work as a hoax.<ref name=\"pbsor\"/> Picasso did not exhibit ''Le Demoiselles'' publicly until 1916.\n\nOther works from this period include ''Nude with Raised Arms'' (1907) and ''Three Women'' (1908). Formal ideas developed during this period lead directly into the Cubist period that follows.\n\n=== Analytic cubism: 1909\u20131912 ===\nAnalytic [[cubism]] (1909\u20131912) is a style of painting Picasso developed with [[Georges Braque]] using monochrome brownish and neutral colours. Both artists took apart objects and \"analyzed\" them in terms of their shapes. Picasso and Braque's paintings at this time share many similarities.\n\nIn Paris, Picasso entertained a distinguished coterie of friends in the [[Montmartre]] and Montparnasse quarters, including [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]], poet [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], writer [[Alfred Jarry]] and Gertrude Stein. In 1911, Picasso was arrested and questioned about [[Mona Lisa#Theft and vandalism|the theft of the ''Mona Lisa'']] from the [[Louvre]]. Suspicion for the crime had initially fallen upon Apollinaire due to his links to G\u00e9ry Pieret, an artist with a history of thefts from the gallery. Apollinaire in turn implicated his close friend Picasso, who had also purchased stolen artworks from the artist in the past. Afraid of a conviction that could result in his deportation to Spain, Picasso denied having ever met Apollinaire. Both were later cleared of any involvement in the painting's disappearance.<ref name=\"thief\"/><ref name=\"TIME - 08Apr2009 - Art's Great Whodunit: The Mona Lisa Theft of 1911\"/>\n\n=== Synthetic cubism: 1912\u20131919 ===\n{{main|Crystal Cubism}}\n[[File:Pablo Picasso, summer 1912.jpg|thumb|upright|Picasso in front of his painting ''The Aficionado'' ([[Kunstmuseum Basel]]) at Villa les Clochettes, summer 1912]]\nSynthetic cubism (1912\u20131919) was a further development of the genre of cubism, in which cut paper fragments&nbsp;\u2013 often wallpaper or portions of newspaper pages&nbsp;\u2013 were pasted into compositions, marking the first use of [[collage]] in fine art.\n\nBetween 1915 and 1917, Picasso began a series of paintings depicting highly geometric and minimalist Cubist objects, consisting of either a pipe, a guitar or a glass, with an occasional element of collage. \"Hard-edged square-cut diamonds\", notes art historian [[John Richardson (art historian)|John Richardson]], \"these gems do not always have upside or downside\".<ref name=\"Richardson\"/><ref name=\"kahn18\"/> \"We need a new name to designate them,\" wrote Picasso to [[Gertrude Stein]]: Maurice Raynal suggested \"[[Crystal Cubism]]\".<ref name=\"Richardson\" /><ref name=\"moran143\"/> These \"little gems\" may have been produced by Picasso in response to critics who had claimed his defection from the movement, through his experimentation with classicism within the so-called [[return to order]] following the war.<ref name=\"Richardson\" /><ref name=\"Green, 1987\"/>\n\nAfter acquiring some fame and fortune, Picasso left Olivier for Marcelle Humbert, whom he called [[Eva Gouel]]. Picasso included declarations of his love for Eva in many Cubist works. Picasso was devastated by her premature death from illness at the age of 30 in 1915.<ref name=\"primi\"/>\n\nAt the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Picasso was living in [[Avignon]]. Braque and Derain were mobilized and Apollinaire joined the French artillery, while the Spaniard [[Juan Gris]] remained from the Cubist circle. During the war, Picasso was able to continue painting uninterrupted, unlike his French comrades. His paintings became more sombre and his life changed with dramatic consequences. Kahnweiler's contract had terminated on his exile from France. At this point Picasso's work would be taken on by the art dealer [[L\u00e9once Rosenberg]]. After the loss of Eva Gouel, Picasso had an affair with [[Gaby Lespinasse]]. During the spring of 1916, Apollinaire returned from the front wounded. They renewed their friendship, but Picasso began to frequent new social circles.<ref name=\"moma92\"/>\n\n[[File:Costume design by Pablo Picasso representing skyscrapers and boulevards, for Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes performance of Parade at Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet, Paris 18 May 1917.jpg|thumb|upright|Costume design by Pablo Picasso representing skyscrapers and boulevards, for [[Serge Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]] performance of ''[[Parade (ballet)|Parade]]'' at Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet, Paris 18 May 1917]]\n\n{{Further|Picasso and the Ballets Russes}}\n\nTowards the end of World War I, Picasso became involved with [[Serge Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]]. Among his friends during this period were [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Jean Hugo]], Juan Gris, and others. In the summer of 1918, Picasso married [[Olga Khokhlova]], a ballerina with Sergei Diaghilev's troupe, for whom Picasso was designing a ballet, Erik Satie's ''[[Parade (ballet)|Parade]]'', in Rome; they spent their honeymoon near [[Biarritz]] in the villa of glamorous Chilean art patron [[Eugenia Err\u00e1zuriz]].\n\n[[File:Pablo Picasso and scene painters sitting on the front cloth for Parade (Ballets Russes) at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet, Paris, 1917, Lachmann photographer.jpg|thumb|left|Pablo Picasso and scene painters sitting on the front cloth for [[L\u00e9onide Massine]]'s ballet ''Parade'', staged by [[Sergei Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]] at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet, Paris, 1917]]\n\nAfter returning from his honeymoon and in need of money, Picasso started his exclusive relationship with the French-Jewish art dealer [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]]. As part of his first duties, Rosenberg agreed to rent the couple an apartment in Paris at his own expense, which was located next to his own house. This was the start of a deep brother-like friendship between two very different men, that would last until the outbreak of World War II.\n\nKhokhlova introduced Picasso to high society, formal dinner parties, and other dimensions of the life of the rich in 1920s Paris. The two had a son, Paulo Picasso,<ref name=\"xtime\"/> who would grow up to be a motorcycle racer and chauffeur to his father. Khokhlova's insistence on social propriety clashed with Picasso's [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] tendencies and the two lived in a state of constant conflict. During the same period that Picasso collaborated with Diaghilev's troupe, he and [[Igor Stravinsky]] collaborated on ''[[Pulcinella (ballet)|Pulcinella]]'' in 1920. Picasso took the opportunity to make several drawings of the composer.<ref name=\"cubis\"/>\n\nIn 1927, Picasso met 17-year-old [[Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter]] and began a secret affair with her. Picasso's marriage to Khokhlova soon ended in separation rather than divorce, as French law required an even division of property in the case of divorce, and Picasso did not want Khokhlova to have half his wealth. The two remained legally married until Khokhlova's death in 1955. Picasso carried on a long-standing affair with Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter and fathered a daughter with her, named Maya. Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se lived in the vain hope that Picasso would one day marry her, and hanged herself four years after Picasso's death.\n{{-}}\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"180px\" class=\"center\">\nFile:Pablo Picasso, 1909, Femme assise (Sitzende Frau), oil on canvas, 100 x 80 cm, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Neue Nationalgalerie.jpg|1909, ''Femme assise (Sitzende Frau)'', oil on canvas, 100 \u00d7 80&nbsp;cm, [[Berlin State Museums|Staatliche Museen]], [[Neue Nationalgalerie]], Berlin\nFile:Pablo Picasso, 1909-10, Figure dans un Fauteuil (Seated Nude, Femme nue assise), oil on canvas, 92.1 x 73 cm, Tate Modern, London.jpg|1909\u201310, ''Figure dans un Fauteuil (Seated Nude, Femme nue assise)'', oil on canvas, 92.1 \u00d7 73&nbsp;cm, [[Tate Modern]], London.

This \"[[return to order]]\" is evident in the work of many European artists in the 1920s, including [[Andr\u00e9 Derain]], [[Giorgio de Chirico]], [[Gino Severini]], [[Jean Metzinger]], the artists of the [[New Objectivity]] movement and of the [[Novecento Italiano]] movement. Picasso's paintings and drawings from this period frequently recall the work of [[Raphael]] and [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]].\n\nIn 1925 the [[Surrealist]] writer and poet [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]] declared Picasso as 'one of ours' in his article ''Le Surr\u00e9alisme et la peinture'', published in ''R\u00e9volution surr\u00e9aliste''. ''Les Demoiselles'' was reproduced for the first time in Europe in the same issue. Yet Picasso exhibited Cubist works at the first Surrealist group exhibition in 1925; the concept of 'psychic automatism in its pure state' defined in the ''Manifeste du surr\u00e9alisme'' never appealed to him entirely. He did at the time develop new imagery and formal syntax for expressing himself emotionally, \"releasing the violence, the psychic fears and the eroticism that had been largely contained or sublimated since 1909\", writes art historian Melissa McQuillan.<ref name=\"MoMA\"/> Although this transition in Picasso's work was informed by Cubism for its spatial relations, \"the fusion of ritual and abandon in the imagery recalls the primitivism of the Demoiselles and the elusive psychological resonances of his Symbolist work\", writes McQuillan.<ref name=\"MoMA\" /> Surrealism revived Picasso's attraction to primitivism and eroticism.<ref name=\"MoMA\" />\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"180px\" class=\"center\">\nFile:Pablo Picasso, 1918, Pierrot, oil on canvas, 92.7 x 73 cm, Museum of Modern Art.jpg|Pablo Picasso, 1918, ''Pierrot'', oil on canvas, 92.7 \u00d7 73&nbsp;cm, [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York\nFile:Pablo Picasso, 1919, Sleeping Peasants, gouache, watercolor and pencil on paper, 31.1 x 48.9 cm, Museum of Modern Art, New York.jpg|Pablo Picasso, 1919, ''Sleeping Peasants'', gouache, watercolor and pencil on paper, 31.1 \u00d7 48.9&nbsp;cm, [[Museum of Modern Art]]\nFile:Pablo Picasso, 1917-18, Portrait d'Olga dans un fauteuil (Olga in an Armchair), oil on canvas, 130 x 88.8 cm, Mus\u00e9e Picasso, Paris, France.jpg|''Portrait d'Olga dans un fauteuil (Olga in an Armchair)'', 1918, [[Mus\u00e9e Picasso]], Paris, France\n</gallery>\n\n=== The Great Depression to MoMA exhibition: 1930\u20131939 ===\nDuring the 1930s, the [[minotaur]] replaced the [[harlequin]] as a common motif in his work. His use of the minotaur came partly from his contact with the surrealists, who often used it as their symbol, and it appears in Picasso's ''Guernica''. The minotaur and Picasso's mistress [[Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter]] are heavily featured in his celebrated ''[[Vollard Suite]]'' of etchings.<ref name='TelegMay12'/>\n\n[[File:PicassoGuernica.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'', 1937, [[Museo Reina Sofia]]]]\n\nArguably Picasso's most famous work is his depiction of the German [[bombing of Guernica]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]] \u2013 ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]''. This large canvas embodies for many the inhumanity, brutality and hopelessness of war. Asked to explain its symbolism, Picasso said, \"It isn't up to the painter to define the symbols. Otherwise it would be better if he wrote them out in so many words! The public who look at the picture must interpret the symbols as they understand them.\"<ref name=\"pbso4\"/><ref name=\"costa\"/> ''Guernica'' was exhibited in July 1937 at the Spanish Pavilion at the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|Paris International Exposition]], and then became the centerpiece of an exhibition of 118 works by Picasso, [[Matisse]], [[Braque]] and [[Henri Laurens]] that toured Scandinavia and England. After the victory of Francisco Franco in Spain, the painting was sent to the United States to raise funds and support for Spanish refugees. Until 1981 it was entrusted to the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City, as it was Picasso's expressed desire that the painting should not be delivered to Spain until liberty and democracy had been established in the country.\n\nIn 1939 and 1940, the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City, under its director [[Alfred Barr]], a Picasso enthusiast, held a major retrospective of Picasso's principal works until that time. This exhibition lionized the artist, brought into full public view in America the scope of his artistry, and resulted in a reinterpretation of his work by contemporary art historians and scholars.<ref name=\"marke\"/> According to Jonathan Weinberg, \"Given the extraordinary quality of the show and Picasso's enormous prestige, generally heightened by the political impact of ''Guernica'' ... the critics were surprisingly ambivalent\".<ref name=\"Weinberg_33\"/> Picasso's \"multiplicity of styles\" was disturbing to one journalist, another described the artist as \"wayward and even malicious\"; [[Alfred Frankenstein]]'s review in ''[[ARTnews]]'' concluded that Picasso was both charlatan and genius.<ref name=\"Weinberg_33\"/>\n{{-}}\n\n=== World War II and late 1940s: 1939\u20131949 ===\n\n[[File:Pablo Picasso in NMW.jpg|thumb|left|[[Stanis\u0142aw Lorentz]] guides Pablo Picasso through the [[National Museum in Warsaw]] in Poland during exhibition ''Contemporary French Painters and Pablo Picasso's Ceramics'', 1948.

Picasso's artistic style did not fit the [[Nazi art|Nazi ideal of art]], so he did not exhibit during this time. He was often harassed by the [[Gestapo]]. During one search of his apartment, an officer saw a photograph of the painting ''Guernica''. \"Did you do that?\" the German asked Picasso. \"No,\" he replied, \"You did\".<ref name=\"Regan25\"/>\n\nRetreating to his studio, he continued to paint, producing works such as the ''Still Life with Guitar'' (1942) and ''[[The Charnel House]]'' (1944\u201348).<ref name=\"blogs\"/> Although the Germans outlawed [[bronze]] casting in Paris, Picasso continued regardless, using bronze smuggled to him by the [[French Resistance]].<ref name=\"artn3\"/>\n\nAround this time, [[Picasso's poetry|Picasso wrote poetry]] as an alternative outlet. Between 1935 and 1959 he wrote over 300 poems. Largely untitled except for a date and sometimes the location of where it was written (for example \"Paris 16 May 1936\"), these works were gustatory, erotic and at times [[Scatology#Literature|scatological]], as were his two full-length plays ''[[Desire Caught by the Tail]]'' (1941) and ''[[The Four Little Girls]]'' (1949).<ref name=\"orgaz\"/><ref name=\"blogs7\"/>\n\nIn 1944, after the liberation of Paris, Picasso, then 63 years old, began a romantic relationship with a young art student named [[Fran\u00e7oise Gilot]]. She was 40 years younger than he was. Picasso grew tired of his mistress [[Dora Maar]]; Picasso and Gilot began to live together. Eventually they had two children: [[Claude Picasso]], born in 1947 and [[Paloma Picasso]], born in 1949. In her 1964 book ''Life with Picasso'',<ref name=\"life6\"/> Gilot describes his abusive treatment and myriad [[infidelities]] which led her to leave him, taking the children with her. This was a severe blow to Picasso.\n\n[[File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Milano, 1953) - BEIC 6356204.jpg|thumb|upright|Pablo Picasso photographed in 1953 by [[Paolo Monti]] during an exhibition at [[Royal Palace of Milan|Palazzo Reale]] in Milan (Fondo Paolo Monti, [[Biblioteca europea di informazione e cultura|BEIC]]).]]\n\nPicasso had affairs with women of an even greater age disparity than his and Gilot's. While still involved with Gilot, in 1951 Picasso had a six-week affair with [[Genevi\u00e8ve Laporte]], who was four years younger than Gilot. By his 70s, many paintings, ink drawings and prints have as their theme an old, grotesque dwarf as the doting lover of a beautiful young model. [[Jacqueline Roque]] (1927\u20131986) worked at the Madoura Pottery in [[Vallauris]] on the [[French Riviera]], where Picasso made and painted ceramics. She became his lover, and then his second wife in 1961. The two were together for the remainder of Picasso's life.\n\nHis marriage to Roque was also a means of revenge against Gilot; with Picasso's encouragement, Gilot had divorced her then husband, Luc Simon, with the plan to marry Picasso to secure the rights of her children as Picasso's legitimate heirs. Picasso had already secretly married Roque, after Gilot had filed for divorce. His strained relationship with Claude and Paloma was never healed.<ref name=\"expre\"/>\n\nBy this time, Picasso had constructed a huge [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] home, and could afford large villas in the south of France, such as Mas Notre-Dame-de-Vie on the outskirts of [[Mougins]], and in the [[Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur]]. He was an international celebrity, with often as much interest in his personal life as his art.<ref name=\"chess\"/>\n\n=== Later works to final years: 1949\u20131973 ===\n[[File:2004-09-07 1800x2400 chicago picasso.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The ''[[Chicago Picasso]]'', a 50-foot high public [[Cubist sculpture]]. Donated by Picasso to the people of Chicago]]\n\nPicasso was one of 250 sculptors who exhibited in the [[3rd Sculpture International]] held at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] in mid-1949. In the 1950s, Picasso's style changed once again, as he took to producing reinterpretations of the art of the great masters. He made a [[Las Meninas (Picasso)|series]] of works based on [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez|Vel\u00e1zquez]]'s painting of ''[[Las Meninas]]''. He also based paintings on works by [[Francisco Goya|Goya]], [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin]], [[\u00c9douard Manet|Manet]], [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]] and [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix|Delacroix]].\n\nIn addition to his artistic accomplishments, Picasso made a few film appearances, always as himself, including a cameo in Jean Cocteau's ''[[Testament of Orpheus]]'' (1960). In 1955, he helped make the film ''Le Myst\u00e8re Picasso'' (''[[The Mystery of Picasso]]'') directed by [[Henri-Georges Clouzot]].\n[[File:Pablo picasso 1.jpg|thumb|left|alt=An elderly Pablo Picasso in a cloth cap, grinning at the camera|upright|Picasso in 1962]]\nHe was commissioned to make a [[maquette]] for a huge {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}}-high [[public art|public sculpture]] to be built in Chicago, known usually as the ''[[Chicago Picasso]]''. He approached the project with a great deal of enthusiasm, designing a sculpture which was ambiguous and somewhat controversial. What the figure represents is not known; it could be a bird, a horse, a woman or a totally abstract shape. The sculpture, one of the most recognizable landmarks in downtown Chicago, was unveiled in 1967. Picasso refused to be paid $100,000 for it, donating it to the people of the city.\n\nPicasso's final works were a mixture of styles, his means of expression in constant flux until the end of his life. Devoting his full energies to his work, Picasso became more daring, his works more colourful and expressive, and from 1968 to 1971 he produced a torrent of paintings and hundreds of copperplate etchings. At the time these works were dismissed by most as pornographic fantasies of an impotent old man or the slapdash works of an artist who was past his prime.<ref name=\"wort472\"/><ref name=\"late0\"/> Only later, after Picasso's death, when the rest of the art world had moved on from [[abstract expressionism]], did the critical community come to see the late works of Picasso as prefiguring [[Neo-Expressionism]].<ref name=\"late3\"/>\n\nPablo Picasso died on 8 April 1973 in [[Mougins]], France from [[pulmonary edema]] and heart failure, while he and his wife Jacqueline entertained friends for dinner. He was interred at the [[Ch\u00e2teau of Vauvenargues]] near [[Aix-en-Provence]], a property he had acquired in 1958 and occupied with Jacqueline between 1959 and 1962. Jacqueline Roque prevented his children Claude and Paloma from attending the funeral.<ref name=\"riche\"/> Devastated and lonely after the death of Picasso, Jacqueline Roque killed herself by gunshot in 1986 when she was 59 years old.<ref name=\"famil\"/>\n\n== Political views ==\n[[File:Picasso Massacre in Korea.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|''[[Massacre in Korea]]'', 1951]]\n\nPicasso remained aloof from the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] independence movement during his youth despite expressing general support and being friendly with activists within it. He did not join the armed forces for any side or country during World War I, the [[Spanish Civil War]], and World War II. As a Spanish citizen living in France, Picasso was under no compulsion to fight against the invading Germans in either world war. However, in 1940, he did apply for French citizenship, but it was refused on the grounds of his \"extremist ideas evolving towards communism\". This information was not revealed until 2003.<ref name=\"smhc5\"/>\n\nAt the start of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, Picasso was 54 years of age. Soon after hostilities began, the Republicans appointed him \"director of the Prado, albeit in absentia\", and \"he took his duties very seriously\", according to John Richardson, supplying the funds to evacuate the museum's collection to Geneva.<ref name=\"Richardson_NYRB_25November2010\"/> The war provided the impetus for Picasso's first overtly [[The arts and politics|political work]]. He expressed anger and condemnation of [[Francisco Franco]] and fascists in ''[[The Dream and Lie of Franco]]'' (1937), which was produced \"specifically for propagandistic and fundraising purposes\".<ref name=\"pbs\" /> This surreal fusion of words and images was intended to be sold as a series of postcards to raise funds for the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Spanish Republican cause]].<ref name=\"pbs\"/><ref name=\"ngv\"/>\n\nIn 1944, Picasso joined the [[French Communist Party]], attended the [[World Congress of Intellectuals in Defense of Peace]] in Poland, and in 1950 received the [[Stalin Peace Prize]] from the Soviet government.<ref name=\"artn23\"/> Party criticism in 1953 of his portrait of [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] as insufficiently realistic cooled Picasso's interest in Soviet politics, though he remained a loyal member of the Communist Party until his death.<ref name=\"Richardson_NYRB_25November2010\"/> His dealer, [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler|D-H. Kahnweiler]], a socialist, termed Picasso's communism \"sentimental\" rather than political, saying \"He has never read a line of Karl Marx, nor of Engels of course.\"<ref name=\"Richardson_NYRB_25November2010\"/> In a 1945 interview with Jerome Seckler, Picasso stated: \"I am a Communist and my painting is Communist painting. ... But if I were a shoemaker, Royalist or Communist or anything else, I would not necessarily hammer my shoes in a special way to show my politics.\"<ref name=\"selec\"/> His commitment to communism, common among [[Continental Europe|continental]] intellectuals and artists at the time, has long been the subject of some controversy; a notable demonstration thereof was a quote commonly attributed to [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]] (with whom Picasso had a rather strained relationship<ref name=\"larep\"/>):\n: '' Picasso es pintor, yo tambi\u00e9n; [...] Picasso es espa\u00f1ol, yo tambi\u00e9n; Picasso es comunista, yo tampoco.''\n:(Picasso is a painter, so am I; [...] Picasso is a Spaniard, so am I; Picasso is a communist, neither am I.)<ref name=\"monog\"/><ref name=\"elmun\"/><ref name=\"peace\"/>\n\nIn the late 1940s, his old friend the [[surrealist]] poet and [[Leon Trosky|Trotskyist]]<ref name=\"alang\"/> and anti-Stalinist [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]] was more blunt; refusing to shake hands with Picasso, he told him: \"I don't approve of your joining the Communist Party nor with the stand you have taken concerning the purges of the intellectuals after the Liberation\".<ref name=\"destr\"/>\nPicasso was against the intervention of the United Nations and the United States in the [[Korean War]] and he depicted it in ''[[Massacre in Korea]]''.<ref name=\"afte15\"/><ref name=\"retro\"/> The art critic Kirsten Hoving Keen says that it is \"inspired by reports of American atrocities\" and considers it one of Picasso's communist works.<ref name=\"commu464\"/>\n\nIn 1962, he received the [[Lenin Peace Prize]].<ref name=\"stali\"/> Biographer and art critic [[John Berger]] felt his talents as an artist were \"wasted\" by the communists.<ref name=\"fail05\"/> According to Jean Cocteau's diaries, Picasso once said to him in reference to the communists: \"I have joined a family, and like all families, it's full of shit\".<ref name=\"guar50\"/>\n\n== Style and technique ==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | header =\n | header_align = left/right/center\n | header_background =\n | footer =\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background =\n | width =\n | image1 = Pablo Picasso, 1901, Old Woman (Woman with Gloves), oil on cardboard, 67 x 52.1 cm, Philadelphia Museum of Art.jpg\n | width1 = 160\n | caption1 = Pablo Picasso, 1901, ''Old Woman (Woman with Gloves)'', oil on cardboard, 67 \u00d7 52.1&nbsp;cm, [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]\n | image2 = Pablo Picasso, 1901-02, Femme au caf\u00e9 (Absinthe Drinker), oil on canvas, 73 x 54 cm, Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg, Russia.jpg\n | width2 = 152\n | caption2 = Pablo Picasso, 1901\u201302, ''Femme au caf\u00e9 (Absinthe Drinker)'', oil on canvas, 73 \u00d7 54 cm, [[Hermitage Museum]]\n}}\n<!--[[File:Pablo Picasso, 1901, Old Woman (Woman with Gloves), oil on cardboard, 67 x 52.1 cm, Philadelphia Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|Pablo Picasso, 1901, ''Old Woman (Woman with Gloves)'', oil on cardboard, 67 \u00d7 52.1&nbsp;cm, [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]]]\n[[File:Pablo Picasso, 1901-02, Femme au caf\u00e9 (Absinthe Drinker), oil on canvas, 73 x 54 cm, Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg, Russia.jpg|thumb|Pablo Picasso, 1901\u201302, ''Femme au caf\u00e9 (Absinthe Drinker)'', oil on canvas, 73 \u00d7 54 cm, [[Hermitage Museum]], Saint Petersburg, Russia]]-->\n\nPicasso was exceptionally prolific throughout his long lifetime. The total number of artworks he produced has been estimated at 50,000, comprising 1,885 paintings; 1,228 sculptures; 2,880 ceramics, roughly 12,000 drawings, many thousands of prints, and numerous tapestries and rugs.<ref name=\"gelon\"/>\n\nThe medium in which Picasso made his most important contribution was painting.<ref name=\"McQuillan\"/> In his paintings, Picasso used colour as an expressive element, but relied on drawing rather than subtleties of colour to create form and space.<ref name=\"McQuillan\"/> He sometimes added sand to his paint to vary its texture. A [[nanoprobe (device)|nanoprobe]] of Picasso's ''The Red Armchair'' (1931) by physicists at [[Argonne National Laboratory]] in 2012 confirmed art historians' belief that Picasso used common house paint in many of his paintings.<ref>Moskowitz, Clara (8 February 2013).

Retrieved 9 February 2013.</ref> Much of his painting was done at night by artificial light.\n\nPicasso's early sculptures were carved from wood or modelled in wax or clay, but from 1909 to 1928 Picasso abandoned modelling and instead made sculptural constructions using diverse materials.<ref name=\"McQuillan\"/> An example is ''Guitar'' (1912), a relief construction made of sheet metal and wire that Jane Fluegel terms a \"three-dimensional planar counterpart of Cubist painting\" that marks a \"revolutionary departure from the traditional approaches, modeling and carving\".<ref name=\"rube150\"/>\n\n[[File:Pablo Picasso, 1921, Nous autres musiciens (Three Musicians), oil on canvas, 204.5 x 188.3 cm, Philadelphia Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|Pablo Picasso, 1921, ''Nous autres musiciens (Three Musicians)'', oil on canvas, 204.5 x 188.3&nbsp;cm, [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]]]\nFrom the beginning of his career, Picasso displayed an interest in subject matter of every kind,<ref name=\"cirl164\"/> and demonstrated a great stylistic versatility that enabled him to work in several styles at once. For example, his paintings of 1917 included the [[pointillist]] ''Woman with a Mantilla'', the Cubist ''Figure in an Armchair'', and the naturalistic ''Harlequin'' (all in the [[Museu Picasso]], Barcelona). In 1919, he made a number of drawings from postcards and photographs that reflect his interest in the stylistic conventions and static character of posed photographs.<ref name=\"Cowling&Mundy_208\"/> In 1921 he simultaneously painted several large neoclassical paintings and two versions of the Cubist composition ''[[Three Musicians]]'' (Museum of Modern Art, New York; Philadelphia Museum of Art).<ref name=\"Cowling&Mundy_201\"/> In an interview published in 1923, Picasso said, \"The several manners I have used in my art must not be considered as an evolution, or as steps towards an unknown ideal of painting ... If the subjects I have wanted to express have suggested different ways of expression I have never hesitated to adopt them.\"<ref name=\"Cowling&Mundy_201\"/>\n\nAlthough his Cubist works approach abstraction, Picasso never relinquished the objects of the real world as subject matter. Prominent in his Cubist paintings are forms easily recognized as guitars, violins, and bottles.<ref name=\"cirl158\"/> When Picasso depicted complex narrative scenes it was usually in prints, drawings, and small-scale works; ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' (1937) is one of his few large narrative paintings.<ref name=\"Cowling&Mundy_208\"/>\n\nPicasso painted mostly from imagination or memory. According to [[William Rubin]], Picasso \"could only make great art from subjects that truly involved him ... Unlike Matisse, Picasso had eschewed models virtually all his mature life, preferring to paint individuals whose lives had both impinged on, and had real significance for, his own.\"<ref name=\"Danto_1996\"/> The art critic [[Arthur Danto]] said Picasso's work constitutes a \"vast pictorial autobiography\" that provides some basis for the popular conception that \"Picasso invented a new style each time he fell in love with a new woman\".<ref name=\"Danto_1996\"/> The autobiographical nature of Picasso's art is reinforced by his habit of dating his works, often to the day. He explained: \"I want to leave to posterity a documentation that will be as complete as possible. That's why I put a date on everything I do.\"<ref name=\"Danto_1996\"/>\n\n== Artistic legacy ==\n[[File:Stamp P.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Postage stamp, USSR, 1973. Picasso has been honoured on stamps worldwide.]]\n\nPicasso's influence was and remains immense and widely acknowledged by his admirers and detractors alike. On the occasion of his 1939 retrospective at MoMA, ''Life'' magazine wrote: \"During the 25 years he has dominated modern European art, his enemies say he has been a corrupting influence. With equal violence, his friends say he is the greatest artist alive.\"<ref name=\"spani\"/> In 1998, [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] wrote of him: \"To say that Pablo Picasso dominated Western art in the 20th century is, by now, the merest commonplace. ... No painter or sculptor, not even Michelangelo, had been as famous as this in his own lifetime. ... Though [[Marcel Duchamp]], that cunning old fox of conceptual irony, has certainly had more influence on nominally vanguard art over the past 30 years than Picasso, the Spaniard was the last great beneficiary of the belief that the language of painting and sculpture really mattered to people other than their devotees.\"<ref name=\"time82\"/>\n\n[[File:HotelSale hinten.JPG|thumb|right|[[Mus\u00e9e Picasso]], Paris (Hotel Sal\u00e9, 1659)]]\n\nAt the time of Picasso's death many of his paintings were in his possession, as he had kept off the art market what he did not need to sell. In addition, Picasso had a considerable collection of the work of other famous artists, some his contemporaries, such as [[Henri Matisse]], with whom he had exchanged works. Since Picasso left no will, his death duties (estate tax) to the French state were paid in the form of his works and others from his collection. These works form the core of the immense and representative collection of the [[Mus\u00e9e Picasso]] in Paris. In 2003, relatives of Picasso inaugurated a museum dedicated to him in his birthplace, M\u00e1laga, Spain, the [[Museo Picasso M\u00e1laga]].\n\n[[File:Museu Picasso Barcelona.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Museu Picasso]] is located in the [[Catalan Gothic|gothic]] palaces of Montcada street in [[Barcelona]]]]\n\nThe [[Museu Picasso]] in Barcelona features many of his early works, created while he was living in Spain, including many rarely seen works which reveal his firm grounding in classical techniques. The museum also holds many precise and detailed figure studies done in his youth under his father's tutelage, as well as the extensive collection of Jaime Sabart\u00e9s, his close friend and personal secretary.\n\n''Guernica'' was on display in New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]] for many years. In 1981, it was returned to Spain and was on exhibit at the [[Cas\u00f3n del Buen Retiro]] of the [[Museo del Prado]]. In 1992, the painting was put on display in Madrid's [[Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda|Reina Sof\u00eda Museum]] when it opened.\n\nIn the 1996 movie ''[[Surviving Picasso]]'', Picasso is portrayed by actor [[Anthony Hopkins]].<ref name=\"imdb4\"/> Picasso is also a character in [[Steve Martin]]'s 1993 play, ''[[Picasso at the Lapin Agile]]''. In ''[[A Moveable Feast]]'' by [[Ernest Hemingway]], Hemingway tells [[Gertrude Stein]] that he would like to have some Picassos, but cannot afford them. Later in the book, Hemingway mentions looking at one of Picasso's paintings. He refers to it as Picasso's nude of the girl with the basket of flowers, possibly related to ''Young Naked Girl with Flower Basket''.\n\n[[File:Art Museum Pablo Picasso M\u00fcnster Arkaden.jpg|thumb|right|Art Museum Pablo Picasso [[M\u00fcnster]] Arkaden]]\n\nOn 8 October 2010, ''Picasso: Masterpieces from the Mus\u00e9e National Picasso, Paris,'' an exhibition of 150 paintings, sculptures, drawings, prints and photographs from the Mus\u00e9e National Picasso in Paris, opened at the [[Seattle Art Museum]], [[Seattle]], Washington, US. The exhibition subsequently travelled to [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]], [[Richmond, Virginia]]: the [[M.H. de Young Memorial Museum]], San Francisco, California, US.;<ref name=\"famsf\"/> the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]], Sydney, Australia;<ref name=\"artg33\"/> and the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]], Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\n\n{{As of|2015}}, Picasso remained the top-ranked artist (based on sales of his works at auctions) according to the Art Market Trends report.<ref name=\"artpr\"/> More of his paintings have been stolen than any other artist's;<ref name=\"fasci\"/> in 2012, the [[Art Loss Register]] had 1,147 of his works listed as stolen.<ref name=\"regis\"/> The Picasso Administration functions as his official Estate.

''[[Gar\u00e7on \u00e0 la pipe]]'' sold for US$104&nbsp;million at [[Sotheby's]] on 4 May 2004, establishing a new price record. ''[[Dora Maar au Chat]]'' sold for US$95.2&nbsp;million at Sotheby's on 3 May 2006.<ref name=\"milli\"/> On 4 May 2010, ''[[Nude, Green Leaves and Bust]]'' was sold at [[Christie's]] for $106.5&nbsp;million. The 1932 work, which depicts Picasso's mistress [[Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter]] reclining and as a bust, was in the personal collection of Los Angeles philanthropist Frances Lasker Brody, who died in November 2009.<ref name=\"nyti3\"/> On 11 May 2015 his painting ''[[Les Femmes d'Alger|Women of Algiers]]'' set the record for the highest price ever paid for a painting when it sold for US$179.3&nbsp;million at Christie's in New York.<ref name=\"ibti\"/>\n\nOn 21 June 2016, a painting by Pablo Picasso titled ''Femme Assise'' (1909) sold for \u00a343.2&nbsp;million ($63.4&nbsp;million) at Sotheby's London, exceeding the estimate by nearly $20&nbsp;million, setting a world record for the highest price ever paid at auction for a Cubist work.<ref name=\"cnnco\"/><ref name=\"sothe\"/>\n\nOn 17 May 2017, ''The Jerusalem Post'' in an article titled \"Picasso Work Stolen By Nazis Sells for $45 Million at Auction\" reported the sale of a portrait painted by Picasso, the 1939 ''Femme assise, robe bleu'', which was previously misappropriated during the early years of WWII. The painting has changed hands several times since its recovery, most recently through auction in May 2017 at Christie's in New York City.<ref name=\"jpost\"/>\n\nIn March 2018, his ''Femme au B\u00e9ret et \u00e0 la Robe Quadrill\u00e9e'' (1937), a portrait of Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter, sold for  \u00a349.8m at Sotheby's in London.<ref name=\"gaur71\"/>\n\n== Personal life ==\nThroughout his life Picasso maintained several mistresses in addition to his wife or primary partner. Picasso was married twice and had four children by three women:\n* Paulo (4 February 1921 \u2013 5 June 1975, Paul Joseph Picasso) \u2013 with [[Olga Khokhlova]]\n* [[Maya Widmaier-Picasso|Maya]] (born 5 September 1935, Maria de la Concepcion Picasso) \u2013 with [[Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter]]\n* [[Claude Picasso|Claude]] (born 15 May 1947, Claude Pierre Pablo Picasso) \u2013 with [[Fran\u00e7oise Gilot]]\n* [[Paloma Picasso|Paloma]] (born 19 April 1949, Anne Paloma Picasso) \u2013 with Fran\u00e7oise Gilot\n\nPhotographer and painter [[Dora Maar]] was also a constant companion and lover of Picasso. The two were closest in the late 1930s and early 1940s, and it was Maar who documented the painting of ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]''.\n\n== Catalogue raisonn\u00e9 ==\nPicasso entrusted [[Christian Zervos]] to constitute the [[catalogue raisonn\u00e9]] of his work (painted and drawn). The first volume of the catalog, ''Works from 1895 to 1906'', published in 1932, entailed the financial ruin of Zervos, self-publishing under the name ''[[Cahiers d'art]]'', forcing him to sell part of his art collection at auction to avoid bankruptcy.<ref name=\"sale1\"/><ref name=\"uabca\"/>\n\nFrom 1932 to 1978, Zervos constituted the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of the complete works of Picasso in the company of the artist who had become one of his friends in 1924.

Just prior to the Panda's debut at the 1980 Geneva Salon de l'Auto, Giugiaro described his design intent in a 1980 interview with [[Turin]]ese newspaper ''[[La Stampa]]'', published in February 1980:\n\n{{quote|1=\u00abLa Panda (...) \u00e8 come un paio di jeans, che sono poi un vestire semplice, pratico, senza fronzoli.

In September 1982 Fiat added another engine to the line-up: the '''Panda 34''' used an 843&nbsp;cc water-cooled unit, derived from that in the [[Fiat 850|850]].

The Super offered an optional five-speed gearbox. Minor styling changes to the Super included Fiat's revised corporate grille with five diagonal silver bars. The earlier grille design (metal with slots on the left for ventilation) continued on the Comfort models until the next major revision of the line-up. A 30 Super was added in February 1983, offering the Super trim combined with the smaller engine.\n\nThe Panda [[four-wheel drive|4x4]] was launched in June 1983, powered by a 965&nbsp;cc engine with {{convert|48|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} derived from the [[Autobianchi A112]] or [[Fiat 100 series engine]].

Both new engines were from Fiat's new [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] family of four-cylinder water-cooled powerplants with a single overhead camshaft. The rear suspension was also upgraded, the rigid axle with leaf springs being replaced by a more modern dependent suspension system known as the \"Omega axle\", consisting of a non-straight rigid axle with a central mounting and coil springs (first seen on the [[Lancia Y10]], which used the same platform). The 4x4 retained the leaf-sprung live axle set-up.\n\nThe body was strengthened and fully galvanised on later models, virtually eliminating the earlier car's notable tendency to rust.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Rear quarter panels received wheel arches mirroring the front fender/wing wheel arches. Front door quarter windows were eliminated. The bottom seam of the facelifted model's doors retained much the earlier car's susceptibility to rust.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The range included 750L, 750CL, 750S, 1000CL, 1000S, 4x4 models.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 2 sst.jpg|thumb|right|Fiat Panda Van]]\n[[File:1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 SISLEY (3863394372).jpg|thumb|left|1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 Sisley]]\n\nApril 1986 saw the introduction of a 1301&nbsp;cc diesel engine with 37&nbsp;bhp (a detuned 127/Uno unit). Fitted as standard with a five-speed gearbox it was only available in the basic \"L\" trim and was available until 1989 (until 1994 in the van versions).\n\nA van variant of the Panda was introduced, with both petrol and diesel engines. The van elimated rear seats and featured rear windows replaced with plastic blanking panels and a small, black, steel extension with side hinged doors \u2014in lieu of a hatch tailgate. Neither the van nor the diesel were available in right hand drive markets.\n\nIn 1987, an entry-level model badged \"Panda Young\" was added to the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769&nbsp;cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod [[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100]] engine and producing the same 34&nbsp;bhp (25&nbsp;kW) as the more sophisticated 769&nbsp;cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released, based on the standard 4x4, with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted wheels, roof rack, headlamp washers, bonnet scoop, \"Sisley\" badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model.\n\n====Panda Elettra====\n[[File:Fiat Panda Elettra 1990.JPG|thumb|left|Panda Elettra in Santiago de Chile, 2010]]\nThe two-seat Panda Elettra, introduced in 1990, added an all-electric power-train to the line. Batteries replaced the rear seats and occupied some of the engine bay where the {{convert|19|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} DC motor was also fitted, driving through the normal clutch and gearbox \u2014 with weight increased to {{convert|1150|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} over than the standard model, necessitating stiffer suspension and uprated brakes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toen al groen: Fiat Panda Elettra|url=http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|publisher=FIATblog.nl|accessdate=24 April 2011|language=nl|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310171825/http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|archivedate=10 March 2012}}</ref> 1992 revisions to the Elettra saw the power increased to {{convert|23.8|bhp|abbr=on}}<ref name=elettra /> and the weight reduced, though the Elettra remained significantly heavier than the standard Panda.\nThis, and the steep price (25.600.000 [[Italian lira|lire]] in Italy, three times the price of the Panda 750 Young) made it a commercial failure. The Elettra was discontinued in 1998.\n\n====Second facelift====\n[[File:1997 Fiat Panda.JPG|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n[[File:Fiat Panda rear 20071205.jpg|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n1991, revisions included a front grille with a smaller five-bar corporate badge, as well as revisions to trim and specifications across the range. New arrivals included the 'Selecta', which had a [[continuously variable transmission]] with an electromagnetic clutch. This transmission was available either with the normal 999&nbsp;cc FIRE engine (revised with single-point fuel injection and a [[catalytic converter]]) or an all new 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit, fitted with electronic fuel injection and a three-way catalytic converter and producing {{convert|51|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe new CLX trim also featured a five-speed gearbox as standard. The range now comprised the 750 Young (769&nbsp;cc ohv), 750 and 750 CLX (both 769&nbsp;cc FIRE sohc), 900 Dance (903&nbsp;cc ohv), 1000 Shopping, CLX, CL Selecta and S (all with 999&nbsp;cc sohc, available with or without SPI and catalytic converter depending on the market), 1100 CL Selecta (1108&nbsp;cc sohc with SPI and cat) and the 4x4 Trekking (999&nbsp;cc, again available with and without a cat depending on the market). The Elettra concluded the range.\n\nIn 1992, the 1108&nbsp;cc engine, complete with SPI and catalytic converter, replaced the 999&nbsp;cc unit in the 4x4 (with 50&nbsp;bhp) and also in 1992 an 899&nbsp;cc (with injection and catalyst) became available, in the 'Cafe' special edition. This was a reduced capacity 903&nbsp;cc unit, designed to meet tax requirements in some markets. Non-catalyzed versions were withdrawn about this time.\n\nIn January 2001, the range underwent its final light adjustment. The 4x4 Trekking continued to be available, while front-wheel-drive versions were down to the Young and the Hobby. The 899&nbsp;cc was discontinued and only the Euro&nbsp;3 capable, fuel injected 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit remained available. These Pandas featured a body-coloured flap for the gas tank, rather than the exposed black plastic cap of earlier models.\n\n====End of production====\nThe Panda was discontinued in the UK in 1995.<ref>https://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/reviews/fiat/panda/2004/209626</ref> The car remained in production in Italy until May 2003. Its total production run of 23 years makes the Fiat Panda one of Europe's longest-lived small cars.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===SEAT Panda / Marbella===\n[[File:Fiat Panda 1st series pink vl.jpg|thumb|right|SEAT Marbella]]\n[[File:SEATTransfront.jpg|thumb|left|SEAT Trans]]\n{{main|SEAT Marbella}}\nSpanish car maker [[SEAT]] also produced a version of the Panda between 1980 and 1986, based on the first Panda model. It was called '''SEAT Panda'''. SEAT also made a tiny, tall delivery version of the Panda called the SEAT Trans.\n\nUp to 1983, SEAT made rebadged versions of Fiat cars through a [[licence]] agreement between the two firms. Thus, there existed a Spanish version of the Panda. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Spain in 1982, he rode in a specially built SEAT Panda.\n\nAfter Fiat sold their share in SEAT and the licence agreement ended, the whole Fiat-based line of SEAT cars were quickly given minor facelifts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The SEAT Panda had its bonnet, bumpers and rear tailgate redesigned. From 1986, when it received a second facelift, it was known as the SEAT Marbella until the end of production in 1998. Emelba also produced a roofless version called the Pandita, which was popular as a rental car in resort areas. The SEAT Trans also received a major facelift and was renamed SEAT Terra.\n\nAs Fiat and SEAT's licensing agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing with the old [[pushrod]] Fiat-based engines, quarter light doors, un-galvanised frame and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life, but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.\n\n===Reception and awards===\nThe first generation Panda met with great success across Europe, polling 2nd in the 1981 [[European Car of the Year]] awards in its first full year of production<ref name=\"caroftheyear.org\">{{cite web | url = http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | title = Previous Cars | accessdate = 29 January 2012 | work = caroftheyear.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101121344/http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | archivedate = 1 January 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> (pipped to first place by the [[Escort xr3i|Ford Escort Mark III]]) and remaining on sale in some regions until May 2003.<ref name=\"panda-marbella.webs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://panda-marbella.webs.com/|title=Fiat Panda|accessdate=24 April 2011|work=panda-marbella.webs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011137/http://www.panda-marbella.webs.com/|archivedate=29 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Giugiaro received the Italian [[Compasso d'Oro]] [[Associazione per il Disegno Industriale|ADI]] [[industrial design]] [[award]] for the Panda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,13/articleid,1054_01_1981_0221_0013_18646326/anews,true/ |title=Compasso d'oro alla Fiat Panda |date=13 September 1981 |page=13 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |language=it |accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\nA less positive reaction to the design came from German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], which in 1980 contrasted Giugiaro defining the Panda as \"the most enchanting work of his life\", and chief designer Felice Cornacchia describing himself as \"proud overall of the car's architecture\" to Peter Glodschey, road tester of mass-market [[Bild]] newspaper, who likened the car to \"a shoe box\".<ref name=\"Spiege071980\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14325284.html|title=Legitimer Erbe: Mit einem neuen Kleinwagen will Italiens gebeutelter Auto-Riese Fiat auf dem deutschen Markt vergraulte Kunden zur\u00fcckgewinnen |quote=Stylist Giorgio Giugiaro: \"F\u00fcr mich war dies die reizvollste Arbeit meines Lebens.\" Chefkonstrukteur Felice Cornacchia: \"Am meisten bin ich stolz auf die Architektur des Wagens.\" Mit einem \"Schuhkarton\" verglich \"Bild\"-Autotester Peter Glodschey den neuen Panda.

In its development phase, the Panda was intended to be called \"Gingo\", but Renault objected because it sounded too close to their Twingo.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe second generation replaced the old Panda after 23 years of production. Like the smaller [[Fiat Seicento]], the Panda was manufactured only in [[Tychy]], Poland, by [[Fiat Auto Poland]].\n\nThe high-bodied Panda takes styling cues from [[mini MPV]]s and [[mini SUV]]s, especially the second generation [[Fiat Multipla]]. The Panda won the [[European Car of the Year]] award in 2004.\n\nThe Panda includes an option for split rear seats, which makes the Panda a four-seater. Since September 2005, all Pandas are equipped with [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]] and at least one front airbag. The gear-lever is located high on the central dashboard, which is designed to make changing gears more comfortable than with a conventional floor-mounted gearstick.\n\nFinancially troubled Fiat needed the new Panda to be a success, and it sold half a million units by October 2005. It sells particularly well in Italy (over half of the cars produced are sold in Italy), being seen as closer to a spiritual successor to the [[Fiat 500]] than a replacement for either the Seicento or the old Panda.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n* The 500,000th new Panda was built on 5 October 2005, a light blue Panda Emotion with the 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].\n* The 1,000,000th new Panda was built on 5 September 2007, a red Panda 4x4 Climbing with 1.2-litre petrol engine.<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2007/cars/fiat/09/panda_1_million/0509.html|date=5 September 2007 |title=One millionth Fiat Panda rolls off the production lines |accessdate=8 September 2007|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 1,500,000th new Panda was built on 21 July 2009, a blue Panda Emotion with 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"www.fiat.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/fiat/07/panda_15_million/2407.html|date=24 July 2009 |title=Fiat Panda number 1,500,000 rolls off the lines at Tychy|accessdate=28 July 2009|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 2,000,000th new Panda rolled out of factory on 4 July 2011, a red Panda 4x4 Cross with 1.3-litre 75&nbsp;bhp Multijet [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"2-millionth-nuova-Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://italiaspeed.com/2011/cars/fiat/07/panda_2_million/0407.html|date=5 July 2011|title=Two millionth second generation Fiat Panda is built at Tychy|accessdate=5 July 2011|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]] Motoring Survey in 2006 ranked the Panda 8th out of 152 cars surveyed for reliability, craftsmanship, ownership costs, driving experience and service received.

These models feature revised 1.1 and 1.2 petrol engines respectively, with better fuel economy and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Both models also qualify for \u00a330 annual road fund licence in the UK, and replace the original standard engines. Dynamic Aircon and SkyDome models were also dropped in favour of simplifying the Panda range.\n\nOn 4 July 2011, Fiat announced that the 2,000,000th Panda had rolled off of their Tychy, Poland assembly line.

The engine range comprised the 1.2 Fire petrol, 1.2 Fire EasyPower (petrol and LPG), 1.4 Fire Natural Power (petrol and CNG) and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The 4x4 was offered with 1.2 petrol and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The Panda Cross was no longer manufactured. The Panda Classic was produced through 2012.\n\n===Models===\n* The '''Natural Power''' is a dual-fuel version, it can burn either gasoline or CNG (Compressed Natural Gas a.k.a. methane). Methane results in low emissions and increased fuel economy. The chassis is the same of the 4x4, the space of the rear wheels differential is occupied by two methane tanks allowing over 240&nbsp;km of autonomy on gas only.\n* The basic '''Actual''' has black bumpers, lacks electric windows and a full-size spare wheel. The Actual was introduced in January 2004.\n* The '''Active''', introduced in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, [[Vehicle audio|radio/cassette player]], driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and the front passenger's airbag have been made standard. This model has the 1100&nbsp;cc \"FIRE\" engine and a five-speed gearbox.\n* The '''Active Plus''' edition is an up-equipped ''Active'', with a [[Cassette player|cassette]]/[[CD player]] as standard. Production of the Active Plus stopped in December 2003.\n* The '''Dynamic''' edition features [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], dual airbags, roof bars, power steering and a [[cassette player]] as standard. A CD & MP3 player, [[CD changer]], alloy wheels, manual or automated [[climate control]], glass sunroof and a semi-automatic transmission are available as options. Since September 2005, four [[airbag]]s have been standard in some countries, with an option for two additional [[Airbags#Side tubular or curtain airbag|side curtain airbags]].\n* The '''Emotion (Eleganza)''' edition is the highest trim level. This particular trim level features significant enhancements over the Dynamic, with a standard CD player, alloy wheels with low profile tires and automated [[climate control]]. In some countries such as the UK, the Emotion is sold as the \"Eleganza\".\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda 100HP\n}}\n* The '''100&nbsp;HP''' edition is the sportiest Panda model. It has the 1.4-litre 16-valve [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] petrol engine from the [[Fiat Punto]] tuned to develop {{convert|100|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}} through a six-speed manual transmission. It differs from other Pandas by being equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes, tinted windows, and sports styled front and rear bumpers. The Panda 100&nbsp;HP features a unique suspension setup with modified springs, dampers, bushes and compliance giving a considerably firmer ride.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp offers 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h acceleration in 9.5&nbsp;s and a maximum speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with fuel consumption at {{convert|6.5|L/100 km|1|abbr=on}} in the EU combined cycle and 154&nbsp;g/km of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It was available in black, white, red, metallic blue, and metallic gray while a \"Pandamonium Pack\" which added red disc brakes, decals and colour-coded wing mirrors was an optional extra.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp was introduced in 2006, but due to tightening emissions regulations, Fiat halted its production in July 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n* The '''4x4 Climbing''' edition, introduced in December 2004, has a higher ride height and larger wheels and tires than other editions. The [[four-wheel drive]] system also makes this edition slower than others. Features are similar to those found in the Dynamic. The Climbing, however, lacks a differential lock and transmission with reductor. The Climbing edition can be distinguished by a slightly higher suspension, additional black plastic overlays on the bumpers and a \"Climbing\" badge just below the \"Panda\" badge on the left side of the rear licence plate. Swedish magazine Vi Bil\u00e4gare found in a test 2007 that Panda 4x4 is a good and economical choice for a small family who need a car with four-wheel drive.\n* The '''Cross''' edition, similar to the Climbing, features differently shaped front and rear lights and additional side cladding. Unlike the Climbing, the Cross does have a differential lock. The Cross edition became available in January 2006 in [[Italy]] and was also available in other markets including right-hand drive.\n\nThe Actual and Active are also bases for the '''Actual Van''' and '''Active Van''', which can be used as small vans (they also have an additional safety net behind the front seats and removable rear seats). These versions can be identified by small \"Van\" label on the back door.\n\nDuring the time, many limited editions of Panda (Active and Dynamic editions only) were produced. Each of them had additional interior fittings, differentiating them from the base model.\n\n===Prototypes and special editions===\n* The '''360 Special Series''', based on the 1.2 L Dynamic, is distinguished by a black and white crosshair style logo on the B pillar. Other upgraded features include; 14&nbsp;inch alloy wheels, metallic paint, special interior trim (including the Fiat brand on the front seats), built in bluetooth phone system, CD player, air conditioning and a split folding rear seat. Other more standard features include; electric windows, central locking system and dual speed power steering. The total of all these extras comes somewhere in the region of \u00a31,600 but surprisingly the upgraded 360 model actually retails at roughly \u00a3400 less than the Dynamic model. On the safety side of things, it comes with anti lock brakes and brake assist as well as two airbags as standard (driver and passenger) with the option of adding an extra four airbags taking the total up to six.\n* '''Fiat Panda Alessi'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda II Alessi 001.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Alessi]]\nItalian Design house [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]] created a special edition featuring a two-tone paint scheme and unique trim inside and out. Fiat gave away some of Alessi's products (coffee machine and tin-can openers) for the special model's debut at the Ideal Home Show in the UK. The rims feature the ''Girotondo'' family accents.\n* '''Fiat Panda Jolly'''\nThe Fiat Panda Jolly was created by Fiat Styling Center and Stola and inspired by boat design. It served as a special shuttle bus in Capri during the summer of 2006. The interior features innovative materials and exclusive trims. The concept mainly came from the 600 Multipla Jolly, a car created by Carrozzeria Ghia in 1956, which could be found on the streets of Capri 50 years ago. Defined by Fiat as \"a car with a fresh, light and Mediterranean look both in the colors and materials\", the Panda Jolly is inspired by the interior design and yacht design worlds, and features styling elements that remind of the spirit and way of life of the 1960s.\n\nThe interiors are created by Paola Lenti, an Italian leading company in the Interior Design sector, specialized in the research and development of innovative fabrics and materials. All the seats are upholstered in the exclusive sailing-inspired Rope fabric. This material is nonallergic, nontoxic, antibacterial and resistant to UV rays. Many structural elements like the floor, sills and various trims are made with pickled natural ash finish with white ash inlays.\n* '''Fiat Panda Terramare 4'''\nPanda Terramare's creator is Milan born Maurizio Zanisi, an independent former [[Iso Rivolta]] engineer, and his self-built amphibian is based on a Panda 4x4 chassis, but with an inflatable flotation belt, and waterjet propulsion driven off the rear axle.\n\nOn 21 July 2006, the Terramare crossed the [[English Channel]] from [[Folkestone]] in Kent to [[Cap Gris Nez]] in just over 6 hours.<ref name=terramare>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/21/fiat-panda-marine-edition/ |title=Fiat Panda Terramare 4 makes it across the English Channel |accessdate=15 February 2009 |work=autoblog.com }}</ref>\n* '''Fiat Panda Luxury'''\nAt the 'Luxury & Yachts' show in February 2006, Fiat exhibited a one-off car based on the 4x4 called the 'Luxury'. The outside of the car features dipped silver paintwork, precious metal trim and gleaming jewel-like mouldings with back-lit inset crystals. The interior features dipped silver appointments, precious metal details, Jewel Alcantara upholstery and leather with mother of pearl finish. The Fiat logo is also worked on the seats with stylish studs and crystals.\n* '''Fiat Panda Hydrogen'''\n[[File:FiatPandaHydrogen1.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Hydrogen]]\n{{main|Fiat Panda Hydrogen}}\n\nThe Panda Hydrogen, a prototype driven by a hydrogen Fuel Cell, was a joint venture between Fiat Auto, the Fiat Research Centre and Fiat Powertrain Research & Technology with the support of the Research and Environment Ministries.\n\nOn the Panda Hydrogen, the Fuel Cell System is housed beneath the floorpan. The fuel cells are made up of several cells connected in series. Inside, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules are forced to react with the aid of a catalyst to produce water and heat. Electrical energy is generated with very high efficiency and zero emissions from the vehicle itself.\n\nAt full power, the Fuel Cell engine on the Panda Hydrogen delivers {{convert|60|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} that allows the car to reach a top speed of more than {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with acceleration from 0 to {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 5 seconds. The car can also easily climb a gradient of 23% at take-off.\n\nDuring 2006 a demonstration stage of small Panda Hydrogen fleets, was a forerunner to other demonstration programs promoted and supported by the European Union and by the Italian Ministries and Regions. The aim is for such vehicles to be marketed within 15 to 20 years.\n* '''Fiat Panda Tanker'''\nUnveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in Italy, the Panda Tanker features only three doors. And although the overall shape has remained unchanged, the two rear doors have been replaced by solid panels to free up some extra load space in the practical cabin.\nRugged extras and underbody protection also help to set the Tanker apart from the standard Panda 4x4 model. Designed in conjunction with Italian [[extreme sport]] clothing manufacturer Dainese, the show star is equipped with sports seats incorporating a rigid titanium fibre shell.\n\nReflecting the matt paint finish of the exterior, the cabin has a back-to-basics feel. With no rear seats, the load floor offers flexible attachments for fixing sports kit, while an aluminium structure is designed to carry mountain bikes.\n* '''Fiat Panda MultiEco'''\nThe Panda MultiEco show-car made its world debut in Geneva 2006. Fiat sees this unit as the future of cars with a low environmental impact: the concept car represents the most advanced frontier achievable in terms of emissions and consumption, combining technologies that already exist or are ready for production.\n\nThe show-car combines an innovative 'powertrain' architecture&nbsp;\u2013 an engine with dual petrol/methane fuel supply, MTA transmission and BAS device&nbsp;\u2013 with the use of eco-compatible materials (recycled, recyclable or of natural origin) for the exterior and interior. The result is made even more interesting by the painstaking optimisation of the aerodynamics and a significant weight reduction.\n\nPanda MultiEco is equipped with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine&nbsp;\u2013 future developments will also make it possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix&nbsp;\u2013 combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic robotised gearbox.\n* '''Fiat PanDAKAR'''\nTwo factory-built Fiat Panda 4x4s were prepared to contest the gruelling [[Dakar 2007]] rally raid, which started in Lisbon.\n\nEntered in the T2 category, the class which most closely represents production vehicles, the two Panda 4x4s, driven by [[Miki Biasion]] and former Dakar winner, [[Bruno Saby]], respectively, are powered by Fiat Auto's 1.3-litre Multijet turbodiesel combined with a six-speed manual gearbox. The engines deliver {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm and a peak torque of {{convert|123|lbft|Nm|1|abbr=on}}. at 2,500&nbsp;rpm. Apart from their small dimensions, the two cars are particularly noteworthy for their automatic all-wheel drive system with viscous coupling and locking differential, a system that provides more grip and traction on rough and soft terrain thanks to the optimal split of drive to the wheels.\n\nThe two Pandas competing in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room has been found inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.\n\nBoth PanDAKAR retired on the fourth stage of the event.\n* '''Fiat Panda Simba'''\nThe Simba was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in 2002 as a concept car to give an idea how the following year's production Panda would look. Some of the rugged styling cues made it on the production '''Cross''' model.\n* '''Fiat Panda Aria'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda Aria 3.jpeg|thumb|Fiat Panda Aria]]\nFiat presented Aria concept in Frankfurt Motor Show 2007. The Aria is equipped with new environment-friendly technology and outputs only 69 g/km [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]. With 900&nbsp;cc turbocharged [[Straight-twin engine|straight-2]] engine it produces {{convert|80|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, it is also capable of using both petrol and CNG.\n\nThis new engine is equipped with Fiat's Multiair technology, which uses electrohydraulic valve activation system. In monofuel (petrol) version the engine is capable of producing {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The car is also equipped with Stop&Start function, which helps to reduce consumption by 10% in urban driving.<ref name=\"worldcarfans.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9070903.005/fiat-panda-aria-concept-debut|title=Fiat Panda Aria Concept Debut|accessdate=23 September 2007|work=worldcarfans.com}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nThe smallest engine, the 1.1&nbsp;L petrol [[SOHC]] [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine, which is rated at {{convert|54|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and found in the [[Fiat Seicento]], has been criticised{{whom|date=November 2019}} for being underpowered for the Panda, which weighs over {{convert|850|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and the acceleration in particular was considered to be very slow. This engine is a construction from the early 1980s.\n\nThe 1.2-litre (actually 1,242&nbsp;cc), {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} engine is a derivative of the 1.1 litre, but with higher torque.\n\nThe 1.3-litre [[Multijet]] diesel engine is rated at {{convert|75|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}} of torque; it is the most economical of all available engines. However, this engine is detuned from the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]] (where it develops {{convert|120|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque) due to the Panda's weaker transmission. Pandas with diesel engines can be easily distinguished by a \"Multijet\" badge on the right side of the rear licence plate.\n\nIntroduced into the range in 2006 was the 1368&nbsp;cc [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine which had previously seen service in the Fiat Stilo and the second generation Punto Sporting (contrary to some press reports, it is not an adapted version of the 1.4 16v Starjet engine used in the Grande Punto). This [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine has four cylinders in-line with sixteen valves actuated by belt driven double overhead camshafts.\n\nThe engine is [[undersquare]] with bore and stroke of {{convert|72|and|84|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} respectively, running at a compression ratio of 10.8:1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n!

Mechanically the range remained largely unchanged.\n\n====First facelift====\n[[File:1989 FIAT Panda.jpg|thumb|right|S post-facelift Panda]]\nIn January 1986, the Panda received visual and mechanical revisions \u2014 with many pre- and post-facelift Panda parts incompatible. The facelift version was internally designated '''141A'''.\n\nThe 652 cc air-cooled two-cylinder engine was replaced by a 769&nbsp;cc (34&nbsp;PS) water-cooled four-cylinder unit, and the 903/965cc by a 999&nbsp;cc (45&nbsp;PS, 50&nbsp;PS (37&nbsp;kW) in the 4x4) unit. Both new engines were from Fiat's new [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] family of four-cylinder water-cooled powerplants with a single overhead camshaft. The rear suspension was also upgraded, the rigid axle with leaf springs being replaced by a more modern dependent suspension system known as the \"Omega axle\", consisting of a non-straight rigid axle with a central mounting and coil springs (first seen on the [[Lancia Y10]], which used the same platform). The 4x4 retained the leaf-sprung live axle set-up.\n\nThe body was strengthened and fully galvanised on later models, virtually eliminating the earlier car's notable tendency to rust.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Rear quarter panels received wheel arches mirroring the front fender/wing wheel arches. Front door quarter windows were eliminated. The bottom seam of the facelifted model's doors retained much the earlier car's susceptibility to rust.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The range included 750L, 750CL, 750S, 1000CL, 1000S, 4x4 models.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 2 sst.jpg|thumb|right|Fiat Panda Van]]\n[[File:1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 SISLEY (3863394372).jpg|thumb|left|1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 Sisley]]\n\nApril 1986 saw the introduction of a 1301&nbsp;cc diesel engine with 37&nbsp;bhp (a detuned 127/Uno unit). Fitted as standard with a five-speed gearbox it was only available in the basic \"L\" trim and was available until 1989 (until 1994 in the van versions).\n\nA van variant of the Panda was introduced, with both petrol and diesel engines. The van elimated rear seats and featured rear windows replaced with plastic blanking panels and a small, black, steel extension with side hinged doors \u2014in lieu of a hatch tailgate. Neither the van nor the diesel were available in right hand drive markets.\n\nIn 1987, an entry-level model badged \"Panda Young\" was added to the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769&nbsp;cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod [[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100]] engine and producing the same 34&nbsp;bhp (25&nbsp;kW) as the more sophisticated 769&nbsp;cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released, based on the standard 4x4, with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted wheels, roof rack, headlamp washers, bonnet scoop, \"Sisley\" badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model.\n\n====Panda Elettra====\n[[File:Fiat Panda Elettra 1990.JPG|thumb|left|Panda Elettra in Santiago de Chile, 2010]]\nThe two-seat Panda Elettra, introduced in 1990, added an all-electric power-train to the line. Batteries replaced the rear seats and occupied some of the engine bay where the {{convert|19|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} DC motor was also fitted, driving through the normal clutch and gearbox \u2014 with weight increased to {{convert|1150|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} over than the standard model, necessitating stiffer suspension and uprated brakes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toen al groen: Fiat Panda Elettra|url=http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|publisher=FIATblog.nl|accessdate=24 April 2011|language=nl|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310171825/http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|archivedate=10 March 2012}}</ref> 1992 revisions to the Elettra saw the power increased to {{convert|23.8|bhp|abbr=on}}<ref name=elettra /> and the weight reduced, though the Elettra remained significantly heavier than the standard Panda.\nThis, and the steep price (25.600.000 [[Italian lira|lire]] in Italy, three times the price of the Panda 750 Young) made it a commercial failure. The Elettra was discontinued in 1998.\n\n====Second facelift====\n[[File:1997 Fiat Panda.JPG|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n[[File:Fiat Panda rear 20071205.jpg|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n1991, revisions included a front grille with a smaller five-bar corporate badge, as well as revisions to trim and specifications across the range. New arrivals included the 'Selecta', which had a [[continuously variable transmission]] with an electromagnetic clutch. This transmission was available either with the normal 999&nbsp;cc FIRE engine (revised with single-point fuel injection and a [[catalytic converter]]) or an all new 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit, fitted with electronic fuel injection and a three-way catalytic converter and producing {{convert|51|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe new CLX trim also featured a five-speed gearbox as standard. The range now comprised the 750 Young (769&nbsp;cc ohv), 750 and 750 CLX (both 769&nbsp;cc FIRE sohc), 900 Dance (903&nbsp;cc ohv), 1000 Shopping, CLX, CL Selecta and S (all with 999&nbsp;cc sohc, available with or without SPI and catalytic converter depending on the market), 1100 CL Selecta (1108&nbsp;cc sohc with SPI and cat) and the 4x4 Trekking (999&nbsp;cc, again available with and without a cat depending on the market). The Elettra concluded the range.\n\nIn 1992, the 1108&nbsp;cc engine, complete with SPI and catalytic converter, replaced the 999&nbsp;cc unit in the 4x4 (with 50&nbsp;bhp) and also in 1992 an 899&nbsp;cc (with injection and catalyst) became available, in the 'Cafe' special edition. This was a reduced capacity 903&nbsp;cc unit, designed to meet tax requirements in some markets. Non-catalyzed versions were withdrawn about this time.\n\nIn January 2001, the range underwent its final light adjustment. The 4x4 Trekking continued to be available, while front-wheel-drive versions were down to the Young and the Hobby. The 899&nbsp;cc was discontinued and only the Euro&nbsp;3 capable, fuel injected 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit remained available. These Pandas featured a body-coloured flap for the gas tank, rather than the exposed black plastic cap of earlier models.\n\n====End of production====\nThe Panda was discontinued in the UK in 1995.<ref>https://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/reviews/fiat/panda/2004/209626</ref> The car remained in production in Italy until May 2003. Its total production run of 23 years makes the Fiat Panda one of Europe's longest-lived small cars.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===SEAT Panda / Marbella===\n[[File:Fiat Panda 1st series pink vl.jpg|thumb|right|SEAT Marbella]]\n[[File:SEATTransfront.jpg|thumb|left|SEAT Trans]]\n{{main|SEAT Marbella}}\nSpanish car maker [[SEAT]] also produced a version of the Panda between 1980 and 1986, based on the first Panda model. It was called '''SEAT Panda'''. SEAT also made a tiny, tall delivery version of the Panda called the SEAT Trans.\n\nUp to 1983, SEAT made rebadged versions of Fiat cars through a [[licence]] agreement between the two firms. Thus, there existed a Spanish version of the Panda. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Spain in 1982, he rode in a specially built SEAT Panda.\n\nAfter Fiat sold their share in SEAT and the licence agreement ended, the whole Fiat-based line of SEAT cars were quickly given minor facelifts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The SEAT Panda had its bonnet, bumpers and rear tailgate redesigned. From 1986, when it received a second facelift, it was known as the SEAT Marbella until the end of production in 1998. Emelba also produced a roofless version called the Pandita, which was popular as a rental car in resort areas. The SEAT Trans also received a major facelift and was renamed SEAT Terra.\n\nAs Fiat and SEAT's licensing agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing with the old [[pushrod]] Fiat-based engines, quarter light doors, un-galvanised frame and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life, but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.\n\n===Reception and awards===\nThe first generation Panda met with great success across Europe, polling 2nd in the 1981 [[European Car of the Year]] awards in its first full year of production<ref name=\"caroftheyear.org\">{{cite web | url = http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | title = Previous Cars | accessdate = 29 January 2012 | work = caroftheyear.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101121344/http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | archivedate = 1 January 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> (pipped to first place by the [[Escort xr3i|Ford Escort Mark III]]) and remaining on sale in some regions until May 2003.<ref name=\"panda-marbella.webs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://panda-marbella.webs.com/|title=Fiat Panda|accessdate=24 April 2011|work=panda-marbella.webs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011137/http://www.panda-marbella.webs.com/|archivedate=29 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Giugiaro received the Italian [[Compasso d'Oro]] [[Associazione per il Disegno Industriale|ADI]] [[industrial design]] [[award]] for the Panda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,13/articleid,1054_01_1981_0221_0013_18646326/anews,true/ |title=Compasso d'oro alla Fiat Panda |date=13 September 1981 |page=13 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |language=it |accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\nA less positive reaction to the design came from German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], which in 1980 contrasted Giugiaro defining the Panda as \"the most enchanting work of his life\", and chief designer Felice Cornacchia describing himself as \"proud overall of the car's architecture\" to Peter Glodschey, road tester of mass-market [[Bild]] newspaper, who likened the car to \"a shoe box\".<ref name=\"Spiege071980\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14325284.html|title=Legitimer Erbe: Mit einem neuen Kleinwagen will Italiens gebeutelter Auto-Riese Fiat auf dem deutschen Markt vergraulte Kunden zur\u00fcckgewinnen |quote=Stylist Giorgio Giugiaro: \"F\u00fcr mich war dies die reizvollste Arbeit meines Lebens.\" Chefkonstrukteur Felice Cornacchia: \"Am meisten bin ich stolz auf die Architektur des Wagens.\" Mit einem \"Schuhkarton\" verglich \"Bild\"-Autotester Peter Glodschey den neuen Panda.

In its development phase, the Panda was intended to be called \"Gingo\", but Renault objected because it sounded too close to their Twingo.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe second generation replaced the old Panda after 23 years of production. Like the smaller [[Fiat Seicento]], the Panda was manufactured only in [[Tychy]], Poland, by [[Fiat Auto Poland]].\n\nThe high-bodied Panda takes styling cues from [[mini MPV]]s and [[mini SUV]]s, especially the second generation [[Fiat Multipla]]. The Panda won the [[European Car of the Year]] award in 2004.\n\nThe Panda includes an option for split rear seats, which makes the Panda a four-seater. Since September 2005, all Pandas are equipped with [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]] and at least one front airbag. The gear-lever is located high on the central dashboard, which is designed to make changing gears more comfortable than with a conventional floor-mounted gearstick.\n\nFinancially troubled Fiat needed the new Panda to be a success, and it sold half a million units by October 2005. It sells particularly well in Italy (over half of the cars produced are sold in Italy), being seen as closer to a spiritual successor to the [[Fiat 500]] than a replacement for either the Seicento or the old Panda.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n* The 500,000th new Panda was built on 5 October 2005, a light blue Panda Emotion with the 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].\n* The 1,000,000th new Panda was built on 5 September 2007, a red Panda 4x4 Climbing with 1.2-litre petrol engine.<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2007/cars/fiat/09/panda_1_million/0509.html|date=5 September 2007 |title=One millionth Fiat Panda rolls off the production lines |accessdate=8 September 2007|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 1,500,000th new Panda was built on 21 July 2009, a blue Panda Emotion with 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"www.fiat.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/fiat/07/panda_15_million/2407.html|date=24 July 2009 |title=Fiat Panda number 1,500,000 rolls off the lines at Tychy|accessdate=28 July 2009|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 2,000,000th new Panda rolled out of factory on 4 July 2011, a red Panda 4x4 Cross with 1.3-litre 75&nbsp;bhp Multijet [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"2-millionth-nuova-Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://italiaspeed.com/2011/cars/fiat/07/panda_2_million/0407.html|date=5 July 2011|title=Two millionth second generation Fiat Panda is built at Tychy|accessdate=5 July 2011|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]] Motoring Survey in 2006 ranked the Panda 8th out of 152 cars surveyed for reliability, craftsmanship, ownership costs, driving experience and service received.

These models feature revised 1.1 and 1.2 petrol engines respectively, with better fuel economy and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Both models also qualify for \u00a330 annual road fund licence in the UK, and replace the original standard engines. Dynamic Aircon and SkyDome models were also dropped in favour of simplifying the Panda range.\n\nOn 4 July 2011, Fiat announced that the 2,000,000th Panda had rolled off of their Tychy, Poland assembly line.

The engine range comprised the 1.2 Fire petrol, 1.2 Fire EasyPower (petrol and LPG), 1.4 Fire Natural Power (petrol and CNG) and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The 4x4 was offered with 1.2 petrol and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The Panda Cross was no longer manufactured. The Panda Classic was produced through 2012.\n\n===Models===\n* The '''Natural Power''' is a dual-fuel version, it can burn either gasoline or CNG (Compressed Natural Gas a.k.a. methane). Methane results in low emissions and increased fuel economy. The chassis is the same of the 4x4, the space of the rear wheels differential is occupied by two methane tanks allowing over 240&nbsp;km of autonomy on gas only.\n* The basic '''Actual''' has black bumpers, lacks electric windows and a full-size spare wheel. The Actual was introduced in January 2004.\n* The '''Active''', introduced in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, [[Vehicle audio|radio/cassette player]], driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and the front passenger's airbag have been made standard. This model has the 1100&nbsp;cc \"FIRE\" engine and a five-speed gearbox.\n* The '''Active Plus''' edition is an up-equipped ''Active'', with a [[Cassette player|cassette]]/[[CD player]] as standard. Production of the Active Plus stopped in December 2003.\n* The '''Dynamic''' edition features [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], dual airbags, roof bars, power steering and a [[cassette player]] as standard. A CD & MP3 player, [[CD changer]], alloy wheels, manual or automated [[climate control]], glass sunroof and a semi-automatic transmission are available as options. Since September 2005, four [[airbag]]s have been standard in some countries, with an option for two additional [[Airbags#Side tubular or curtain airbag|side curtain airbags]].\n* The '''Emotion (Eleganza)''' edition is the highest trim level. This particular trim level features significant enhancements over the Dynamic, with a standard CD player, alloy wheels with low profile tires and automated [[climate control]]. In some countries such as the UK, the Emotion is sold as the \"Eleganza\".\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda 100HP\n}}\n* The '''100&nbsp;HP''' edition is the sportiest Panda model. It has the 1.4-litre 16-valve [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] petrol engine from the [[Fiat Punto]] tuned to develop {{convert|100|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}} through a six-speed manual transmission. It differs from other Pandas by being equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes, tinted windows, and sports styled front and rear bumpers. The Panda 100&nbsp;HP features a unique suspension setup with modified springs, dampers, bushes and compliance giving a considerably firmer ride.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp offers 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h acceleration in 9.5&nbsp;s and a maximum speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with fuel consumption at {{convert|6.5|L/100 km|1|abbr=on}} in the EU combined cycle and 154&nbsp;g/km of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It was available in black, white, red, metallic blue, and metallic gray while a \"Pandamonium Pack\" which added red disc brakes, decals and colour-coded wing mirrors was an optional extra.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp was introduced in 2006, but due to tightening emissions regulations, Fiat halted its production in July 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n* The '''4x4 Climbing''' edition, introduced in December 2004, has a higher ride height and larger wheels and tires than other editions. The [[four-wheel drive]] system also makes this edition slower than others. Features are similar to those found in the Dynamic. The Climbing, however, lacks a differential lock and transmission with reductor. The Climbing edition can be distinguished by a slightly higher suspension, additional black plastic overlays on the bumpers and a \"Climbing\" badge just below the \"Panda\" badge on the left side of the rear licence plate. Swedish magazine Vi Bil\u00e4gare found in a test 2007 that Panda 4x4 is a good and economical choice for a small family who need a car with four-wheel drive.\n* The '''Cross''' edition, similar to the Climbing, features differently shaped front and rear lights and additional side cladding. Unlike the Climbing, the Cross does have a differential lock. The Cross edition became available in January 2006 in [[Italy]] and was also available in other markets including right-hand drive.\n\nThe Actual and Active are also bases for the '''Actual Van''' and '''Active Van''', which can be used as small vans (they also have an additional safety net behind the front seats and removable rear seats). These versions can be identified by small \"Van\" label on the back door.\n\nDuring the time, many limited editions of Panda (Active and Dynamic editions only) were produced. Each of them had additional interior fittings, differentiating them from the base model.\n\n===Prototypes and special editions===\n* The '''360 Special Series''', based on the 1.2 L Dynamic, is distinguished by a black and white crosshair style logo on the B pillar. Other upgraded features include; 14&nbsp;inch alloy wheels, metallic paint, special interior trim (including the Fiat brand on the front seats), built in bluetooth phone system, CD player, air conditioning and a split folding rear seat. Other more standard features include; electric windows, central locking system and dual speed power steering. The total of all these extras comes somewhere in the region of \u00a31,600 but surprisingly the upgraded 360 model actually retails at roughly \u00a3400 less than the Dynamic model. On the safety side of things, it comes with anti lock brakes and brake assist as well as two airbags as standard (driver and passenger) with the option of adding an extra four airbags taking the total up to six.\n* '''Fiat Panda Alessi'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda II Alessi 001.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Alessi]]\nItalian Design house [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]] created a special edition featuring a two-tone paint scheme and unique trim inside and out. Fiat gave away some of Alessi's products (coffee machine and tin-can openers) for the special model's debut at the Ideal Home Show in the UK. The rims feature the ''Girotondo'' family accents.\n* '''Fiat Panda Jolly'''\nThe Fiat Panda Jolly was created by Fiat Styling Center and Stola and inspired by boat design. It served as a special shuttle bus in Capri during the summer of 2006. The interior features innovative materials and exclusive trims. The concept mainly came from the 600 Multipla Jolly, a car created by Carrozzeria Ghia in 1956, which could be found on the streets of Capri 50 years ago. Defined by Fiat as \"a car with a fresh, light and Mediterranean look both in the colors and materials\", the Panda Jolly is inspired by the interior design and yacht design worlds, and features styling elements that remind of the spirit and way of life of the 1960s.\n\nThe interiors are created by Paola Lenti, an Italian leading company in the Interior Design sector, specialized in the research and development of innovative fabrics and materials. All the seats are upholstered in the exclusive sailing-inspired Rope fabric. This material is nonallergic, nontoxic, antibacterial and resistant to UV rays. Many structural elements like the floor, sills and various trims are made with pickled natural ash finish with white ash inlays.\n* '''Fiat Panda Terramare 4'''\nPanda Terramare's creator is Milan born Maurizio Zanisi, an independent former [[Iso Rivolta]] engineer, and his self-built amphibian is based on a Panda 4x4 chassis, but with an inflatable flotation belt, and waterjet propulsion driven off the rear axle.\n\nOn 21 July 2006, the Terramare crossed the [[English Channel]] from [[Folkestone]] in Kent to [[Cap Gris Nez]] in just over 6 hours.<ref name=terramare>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/21/fiat-panda-marine-edition/ |title=Fiat Panda Terramare 4 makes it across the English Channel |accessdate=15 February 2009 |work=autoblog.com }}</ref>\n* '''Fiat Panda Luxury'''\nAt the 'Luxury & Yachts' show in February 2006, Fiat exhibited a one-off car based on the 4x4 called the 'Luxury'. The outside of the car features dipped silver paintwork, precious metal trim and gleaming jewel-like mouldings with back-lit inset crystals. The interior features dipped silver appointments, precious metal details, Jewel Alcantara upholstery and leather with mother of pearl finish. The Fiat logo is also worked on the seats with stylish studs and crystals.\n* '''Fiat Panda Hydrogen'''\n[[File:FiatPandaHydrogen1.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Hydrogen]]\n{{main|Fiat Panda Hydrogen}}\n\nThe Panda Hydrogen, a prototype driven by a hydrogen Fuel Cell, was a joint venture between Fiat Auto, the Fiat Research Centre and Fiat Powertrain Research & Technology with the support of the Research and Environment Ministries.\n\nOn the Panda Hydrogen, the Fuel Cell System is housed beneath the floorpan. The fuel cells are made up of several cells connected in series. Inside, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules are forced to react with the aid of a catalyst to produce water and heat. Electrical energy is generated with very high efficiency and zero emissions from the vehicle itself.\n\nAt full power, the Fuel Cell engine on the Panda Hydrogen delivers {{convert|60|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} that allows the car to reach a top speed of more than {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with acceleration from 0 to {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 5 seconds. The car can also easily climb a gradient of 23% at take-off.\n\nDuring 2006 a demonstration stage of small Panda Hydrogen fleets, was a forerunner to other demonstration programs promoted and supported by the European Union and by the Italian Ministries and Regions. The aim is for such vehicles to be marketed within 15 to 20 years.\n* '''Fiat Panda Tanker'''\nUnveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in Italy, the Panda Tanker features only three doors. And although the overall shape has remained unchanged, the two rear doors have been replaced by solid panels to free up some extra load space in the practical cabin.\nRugged extras and underbody protection also help to set the Tanker apart from the standard Panda 4x4 model. Designed in conjunction with Italian [[extreme sport]] clothing manufacturer Dainese, the show star is equipped with sports seats incorporating a rigid titanium fibre shell.\n\nReflecting the matt paint finish of the exterior, the cabin has a back-to-basics feel. With no rear seats, the load floor offers flexible attachments for fixing sports kit, while an aluminium structure is designed to carry mountain bikes.\n* '''Fiat Panda MultiEco'''\nThe Panda MultiEco show-car made its world debut in Geneva 2006. Fiat sees this unit as the future of cars with a low environmental impact: the concept car represents the most advanced frontier achievable in terms of emissions and consumption, combining technologies that already exist or are ready for production.\n\nThe show-car combines an innovative 'powertrain' architecture&nbsp;\u2013 an engine with dual petrol/methane fuel supply, MTA transmission and BAS device&nbsp;\u2013 with the use of eco-compatible materials (recycled, recyclable or of natural origin) for the exterior and interior. The result is made even more interesting by the painstaking optimisation of the aerodynamics and a significant weight reduction.\n\nPanda MultiEco is equipped with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine&nbsp;\u2013 future developments will also make it possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix&nbsp;\u2013 combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic robotised gearbox.\n* '''Fiat PanDAKAR'''\nTwo factory-built Fiat Panda 4x4s were prepared to contest the gruelling [[Dakar 2007]] rally raid, which started in Lisbon.\n\nEntered in the T2 category, the class which most closely represents production vehicles, the two Panda 4x4s, driven by [[Miki Biasion]] and former Dakar winner, [[Bruno Saby]], respectively, are powered by Fiat Auto's 1.3-litre Multijet turbodiesel combined with a six-speed manual gearbox. The engines deliver {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm and a peak torque of {{convert|123|lbft|Nm|1|abbr=on}}. at 2,500&nbsp;rpm. Apart from their small dimensions, the two cars are particularly noteworthy for their automatic all-wheel drive system with viscous coupling and locking differential, a system that provides more grip and traction on rough and soft terrain thanks to the optimal split of drive to the wheels.\n\nThe two Pandas competing in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room has been found inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.\n\nBoth PanDAKAR retired on the fourth stage of the event.\n* '''Fiat Panda Simba'''\nThe Simba was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in 2002 as a concept car to give an idea how the following year's production Panda would look. Some of the rugged styling cues made it on the production '''Cross''' model.\n* '''Fiat Panda Aria'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda Aria 3.jpeg|thumb|Fiat Panda Aria]]\nFiat presented Aria concept in Frankfurt Motor Show 2007. The Aria is equipped with new environment-friendly technology and outputs only 69 g/km [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]. With 900&nbsp;cc turbocharged [[Straight-twin engine|straight-2]] engine it produces {{convert|80|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, it is also capable of using both petrol and CNG.\n\nThis new engine is equipped with Fiat's Multiair technology, which uses electrohydraulic valve activation system. In monofuel (petrol) version the engine is capable of producing {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The car is also equipped with Stop&Start function, which helps to reduce consumption by 10% in urban driving.<ref name=\"worldcarfans.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9070903.005/fiat-panda-aria-concept-debut|title=Fiat Panda Aria Concept Debut|accessdate=23 September 2007|work=worldcarfans.com}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nThe smallest engine, the 1.1&nbsp;L petrol [[SOHC]] [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine, which is rated at {{convert|54|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and found in the [[Fiat Seicento]], has been criticised{{whom|date=November 2019}} for being underpowered for the Panda, which weighs over {{convert|850|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and the acceleration in particular was considered to be very slow. This engine is a construction from the early 1980s.\n\nThe 1.2-litre (actually 1,242&nbsp;cc), {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} engine is a derivative of the 1.1 litre, but with higher torque.\n\nThe 1.3-litre [[Multijet]] diesel engine is rated at {{convert|75|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}} of torque; it is the most economical of all available engines. However, this engine is detuned from the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]] (where it develops {{convert|120|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque) due to the Panda's weaker transmission. Pandas with diesel engines can be easily distinguished by a \"Multijet\" badge on the right side of the rear licence plate.\n\nIntroduced into the range in 2006 was the 1368&nbsp;cc [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine which had previously seen service in the Fiat Stilo and the second generation Punto Sporting (contrary to some press reports, it is not an adapted version of the 1.4 16v Starjet engine used in the Grande Punto). This [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine has four cylinders in-line with sixteen valves actuated by belt driven double overhead camshafts.\n\nThe engine is [[undersquare]] with bore and stroke of {{convert|72|and|84|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} respectively, running at a compression ratio of 10.8:1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n!

with [[microdialysis]] so that researchers can stimulate genetically identified neurons and also detect the peptides that are released that might be mediating neural circuit changes and behavioral outputs.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n== Career and research ==\nIn 2017, Al-Hasani was recruited to stay at [[Washington University School of Medicine]], along with her husband Jordan McCall, and take on a primary appointment as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Pharmaceutical and Administrative Sciences at the [[St. Louis College of Pharmacy]] as well as an adjunct appointment as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Anesthesiology at the [[Washington University School of Medicine]] (WUSM).<ref name=\":1\" /> Al-Hasani and McCall were the first two researchers to be appointed positions at the new Center for Clinical Pharmacology, formed by a merging of the St. Louis College of Pharmacy and WUSM.<ref name=\":1\" /> Al-Hasani's lab focuses on understanding the neural circuitry involved in addiction, stress, and chronic pain by specifically focusing on the opioid system to elucidate targets for future therapies.<ref name=\":0\" /> By building and using innovative tools for in vivo neural circuit dissection, Al-Hasani and her team study the role of the kappa opioid system in the generation of negative affective states that might accompany chronic pain, withdrawal, and preclude nicotine cessation.<ref name=\":0\" /> In April 2020, Al-Hasani was awarded the Young Investigator Grant from the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation to support her research.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stlcop.edu/news/archive/2020/ream-al-hasani-wins-young-investigator-grant.html|title=Al-Hasani Receives Young Investigator

affective counterpart in a study published in Neuron.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.stlcop.edu/news/archive/2019/connection-between-pain-and-emotion-in-the-brain.html|title=Faculty

understand how the [[\u039a-opioid receptor|kappa opioid]] system mediates the emotional response to pain, which can lead to drug overdose and co-morbid psychiatric conditions such as depression.<ref name=\":9\" /> They targeted their investigation to the ventral shell of the nucleus accumbens (NAc), which Al-Hasani had previously shown to be involved in negative affective states.<ref

They found that pain recruits the dynorphin-kappa opioid system in the NAc, and that the dynorphinergic cells are more active during inflammatory pain due to a decrease in inhibitory inputs onto these cells.<ref name=\":10\" /> By blocking dynorphinergic kappa opioid receptor signalling in the shell of the NAc, they are able to alleviate the decrease in motivation that results from the experience of pain.<ref name=\":10\" />\u00a0 These findings show that the kappa opioid system modulates the emotional aspects of the experience of pain and could serve as a less addictive target for pain treatment compared to opiates.<ref name=\":9\" /> \n\n==== Outreach ====\nBeyond her direct contributions to scientific innovation in the WUSM community, Al-Hasani has helped to mentor the younger generation of scientists and create a space for them to enter the pipeline from a young age.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite

Languages branch into dialects and thence into related languages through small changes in the course of children's learning processes which accumulate over generations, and when speech communities do not communicate (frequently) with each other, these cumulative changes diverge.<ref>\n{{Cite journal\n  | last = Labov\n  | first = William\n  | title = Transmission and diffusion\n  | journal = Language\n  | volume = 83\n  | issue = 2\n  | pages = 344\u2013387\n  | year = 2007\n  | url = http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~wlabov/Papers/TD.pdf\n  | issn = \n  | doi = 10.1353/lan.2007.0082\n  | id = \n  | accessdate = 18 Aug 2010| citeseerx = 10.1.1.705.7860\n  }}</ref> Diffusion of areal features for the most part hinges on low-level phonetic shifts, whereas tree-model transmission includes in addition structural factors such as \"grammatical conditioning, word boundaries, and the systemic relations that drive chain shifting\".<ref>Labov 2007:6.</ref>\n\nIn some areas with high linguistic diversity, a number of areal features have spread across a set of languages to form a [[sprachbund]] (also known as a linguistic area, convergence area or diffusion area).
