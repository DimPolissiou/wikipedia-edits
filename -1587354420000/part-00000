He believed that crux of the ethnic problems was caused by ethnical inequity, which had a major influence on ethnical conflicts in history. Professor Huang advocated the equality of each ethnic of the world and a \"spiritual civilization with scientific attitude\" on ethnic studies. By active practice, he became a forerunner of [[Zhuang studies]] in the 20th century. People therefore called him the \"father of [[Zhuang studies]]\".<ref>Mo Jun. A [[father]] of [[Zhuang studies]]. Nanning\uff1aGuangxi's daily, 3 September 2002.</ref> Based on this, he formed a ''Huang group'' of Zhuang studies and the famous [[Bagui School]] in [[China|Chinese]] history. The Huang group is a pioneering branch of the Chinese Bagui School of [[ethnology]]. It was formed in the 1950s and remains active. The Huang group members include Huang Xianfan and his 18 students, commonly referred to as the Huang Xianfan's 18 elite disciples. His students are [[professors]] or researchers work in [[Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region]], most of whom work in the [[Guangxi Normal University]] and Guangxi University for Nationalities. This is an academic group from the Zhuang and [[Han Chinese|Han]] scholars in combination. Zhuang scholars are Huang Xianfan, Huang Zengqing, Zhang Yiming, Li Guozhu, Su Guanchang, Li Ganfen, Zhou Zongxian, Qin Suguan, Zhou Zuoqiou, Huang Shaoqing, Huang Weicheng, He Yingde, He Longqun, Yu Shijie, Gong Yonghuei, Qin Deqing and Han scholars are Ou Yang Ruoxiou, Xiao Zechang, Zhou Zuoming in this group. The group members focus on the study of [[history]], [[archeology]], [[culture]], [[folklore]], [[education]], [[literature]], historical figures, Dulao system and [[Chieftain]] system of the Zhuang. As the all members of this group can speak minority languages, therefore, this group attaches great importance to the field survey. This is the significant academic characteristic of this group.<ref>Li Wentao. The founder of the Zhuang historiography: Huang Xianfan.

It emerged as a school at the Guangxi Normal University in China when Huang Xianfan became a committeeman of Ethnic Affairs Committee of NPC and head of group of investigation on Guangxi ethnics social history in the mid-1950s. It is active in the Chinese ethnology during the second half of the 20th century and up to present. The Bagui School is the first ethnic school in China. It was particularly dominated by professor Huang Xianfan. Many of its members were Zhuang people who loved and cared about their nationality. Members of the school were all scholars who researched the culture and history of Zhuang nationality in Guangxi, they are all from different universities and ethnic research institutes. As consistently opposed to the ethnical chauvinism, it builds its research on an entirely unconventional framework, which is advocated the equality of each ethnic of China and a'spiritual civilization with scientific attitude' on ethnic studies. Members of the school had a common attitude towards Zhuang nationality. Today, the Bagui school of China continues as a school of Ethnology, have spawned several branch schools which also researched the history of Zhuang nationality.\n\nFor this reason, Huang Xianfan was also honored by ethnic academic circles as a leader of Bagui School.<ref>Chen Jisheng.

His academic principle was \"keep honest and not obedient to the authorities\". He believed that the motto of academic research was \"no authorities, no ends, no prohibitions\". Prefessor Chen Jisheng pointed out: \"The connotation of Professor Huang's academic theory was to connect traditional Chinese history studies with western new history theory in order to complement his favorite Puxue of Qing dynasty, Gu Yanwu's historiography thought with modern American Robinson's \"New History\". Professor Huang had made a great academic contribution to the New History's Practice and Construction in China. His academic works are characterised in connecting western theory of evolution with traditional Chinese theory of Seeking Truth and The Past Serve the Present\". Professor Huang's lifelong pursuit of academic research was Dialectical unity of historical philosophy and historical science.<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\">Chen Jisheng.

He pointed out that those works were lacking descriptions of [[Ethnic groups in Chinese history|Chinese ethnicity]], as if China's general history is the same as [[Han Chinese|Han's]] general history. He was fighting the perception that China is only the equivalent of Han. He believed the riddance of the feudal concept ofchauvinism.<ref>Professor Huang was as a bourgeois rightist by criticism. [[People's Daily]] and Guangxi Daily, a Series of the critical essays from August to November 1957.</ref> He publicly opposed dogmatizing, formulizing and regulating Marxism.  In 1957, Huang advocated a theory of \"lacking of slave society\", later on, in 1979 he brought forward a famous academic view: \"no slave society in Chinese history\". His theory was warmly agreed by most scholars from history circles. They called him \"leader of Wunu school\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cawhi.com/show.aspx?id=7112&cid=16 |title=Chen Jisheng.

He believed that crux of the ethnic problems was caused by ethnical inequity, which had a major influence on ethnical conflicts in history. Professor Huang advocated the equality of each ethnic of the world and a \"spiritual civilization with scientific attitude\" on ethnic studies. By active practice, he became a forerunner of [[Zhuang studies]] in the 20th century. People therefore called him the \"father of [[Zhuang studies]]\".<ref>Mo Jun. A [[father]] of [[Zhuang studies]]. Nanning\uff1aGuangxi's daily, 3 September 2002.</ref> Based on this, he formed a ''Huang group'' of Zhuang studies and the famous [[Bagui School]] in [[China|Chinese]] history. The Huang group is a pioneering branch of the Chinese Bagui School of [[ethnology]]. It was formed in the 1950s and remains active. The Huang group members include Huang Xianfan and his 18 students, commonly referred to as the Huang Xianfan's 18 elite disciples. His students are [[professors]] or researchers work in [[Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region]], most of whom work in the [[Guangxi Normal University]] and Guangxi University for Nationalities. This is an academic group from the Zhuang and [[Han Chinese|Han]] scholars in combination. Zhuang scholars are Huang Xianfan, Huang Zengqing, Zhang Yiming, Li Guozhu, Su Guanchang, Li Ganfen, Zhou Zongxian, Qin Suguan, Zhou Zuoqiou, Huang Shaoqing, Huang Weicheng, He Yingde, He Longqun, Yu Shijie, Gong Yonghuei, Qin Deqing and Han scholars are Ou Yang Ruoxiou, Xiao Zechang, Zhou Zuoming in this group. The group members focus on the study of [[history]], [[archeology]], [[culture]], [[folklore]], [[education]], [[literature]], historical figures, Dulao system and [[Chieftain]] system of the Zhuang. As the all members of this group can speak minority languages, therefore, this group attaches great importance to the field survey. This is the significant academic characteristic of this group.<ref>Li Wentao. The founder of the Zhuang historiography: Huang Xianfan.  Guilin Daily, March 27, 2002.</ref>\n\nThe Bagui School is an academic group of ethnologists that gathered around Huang Xianfan. It emerged as a school at the Guangxi Normal University in China when Huang Xianfan became a committeeman of Ethnic Affairs Committee of NPC and head of group of investigation on Guangxi ethnics social history in the mid-1950s. It is active in the Chinese ethnology during the second half of the 20th century and up to present. The Bagui School is the first ethnic school in China. It was particularly dominated by professor Huang Xianfan. Many of its members were Zhuang people who loved and cared about their nationality. Members of the school were all scholars who researched the culture and history of Zhuang nationality in Guangxi, they are all from different universities and ethnic research institutes. As consistently opposed to the ethnical chauvinism, it builds its research on an entirely unconventional framework, which is advocated the equality of each ethnic of China and a'spiritual civilization with scientific attitude' on ethnic studies. Members of the school had a common attitude towards Zhuang nationality. Today, the Bagui school of China continues as a school of Ethnology, have spawned several branch schools which also researched the history of Zhuang nationality.\n\nFor this reason, Huang Xianfan was also honored by ethnic academic circles as a leader of Bagui School.<ref>Chen Jisheng.
