{"title_page": "List of NCAA Division II Men's Basketball Tournament bids by school", "text_new": "This is a list of '''[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[NCAA Division II Men's Basketball Tournament|Division II Men's Basketball Tournament]] bids by school''', at the conclusion of the 2020 conference tournaments.  As of 2015, there are a total of 64 bids possible (22 automatic qualifiers, 42 at-large).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/m_basketball_champs_records/2013/d2/elite8.pdf|title=Division II Men's Basketball Championship|website=NCAA.org|publisher=NCAA}}</ref>\n\n== Team appearances ==\n===Current Division II members===\n* Appearances include those made by schools in the NCAA College Division Men's Basketball Tournament, the direct predecessor to the current Division II and [[NCAA Division III Men's Basketball Tournament|Division III]] tournaments. The NCAA did not adopt its current three-division alignment until the 1973\u201374 school year, when the College Division was split into Divisions II and III.\n* School names reflect those in current use by their respective athletic programs, not necessarily those used when a school made an appearance in the Division II tournament. For example, [[Jefferson Rams men's basketball|Jefferson]] was known as ''Philadelphia College of Textiles & Science'' (athletically \"Philadelphia Textile\") when it won its NCAA title in [[1970 NCAA College Division Men's Basketball Tournament|1970]], and [[Omaha Mavericks men's basketball|Omaha]] used its institutional identity of [[University of Nebraska Omaha|Nebraska\u2013Omaha]] when it made all of its D-II tournament appearances. \n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

Besides intrinsic resistance, ''P. aeruginosa'' easily develops acquired resistance either by [[mutation]] in chromosomally encoded genes or by the [[horizontal gene transfer]] of antibiotic resistance determinants. Development of [[multidrug resistance]] by ''P. aeruginosa'' isolates requires several different genetic events that include acquisition of different mutations and/or horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes. Hypermutation favours the selection of mutation-driven antibiotic resistance in ''P. aeruginosa'' strains producing chronic infections, whereas the clustering of several different antibiotic resistance genes in [[integron]]s favours the concerted acquisition of antibiotic resistance determinants. Some recent studies have shown phenotypic resistance associated to [[biofilm]] formation or to the emergence of small-colony-variants, which may be important in the response of ''P. aeruginosa'' populations to [[antibiotic]] treatment.<ref name=\"Cornelis\"/>\n\n===Sensitivity to gallium===\nAlthough gallium has no natural function in biology, gallium ions interact with cellular processes in a manner similar to iron(III). When gallium ions are mistakenly taken up in place of iron(III) by bacteria such as ''Pseudomonas'', the ions interfere with respiration, and the bacteria die. This happens because iron is redox-active, allowing the transfer of electrons during respiration, while gallium is redox-inactive.<ref>\"A Trojan-horse strategy selected to fight bacteria\".

Theories include: the bacteria might induce systemic resistance in the host plant, so it can better resist attack by a true pathogen; the bacteria might outcompete other (pathogenic) soil microbes, e.g. by [[siderophore]]s giving a competitive advantage at scavenging for iron; the bacteria might produce compounds antagonistic to other soil microbes, such as [[phenazine]]-type antibiotics or [[hydrogen cyanide]]. Experimental evidence supports all of these theories.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Haas D |author2=Defago G |title=Biological control of soil-borne pathogens by fluorescent pseudomonads |journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=307\u2013319 |date=2005 |pmid=15759041 |doi=10.1038/nrmicro1129}}</ref>\n\nOther notable ''Pseudomonas'' species with biocontrol properties include ''[[Pseudomonas chlororaphis|P. chlororaphis]]'', which produces a [[phenazine]]-type [[antibiotic]] active agent against certain [[fungus|fungal]] plant pathogens,<ref>{{cite journal |display-authors=4 |author=Chin-A-Woeng TF |title=Root colonization by phenazine-1-carboxamide-producing bacterium ''Pseudomonas chlororaphis'' PCL1391 is essential for biocontrol of tomato foot and root rot |journal=Mol Plant Microbe Interact |volume=13 |issue=12 |pages=1340\u20131345 |date=2000 |pmid=11106026  |doi=10.1094/MPMI.2000.13.12.1340|last2=Bloemberg |first2=Guido V. |last3=Mulders |first3=Ine H.

Besides intrinsic resistance, ''P. aeruginosa'' easily develops acquired resistance either by [[mutation]] in chromosomally encoded genes or by the [[horizontal gene transfer]] of antibiotic resistance determinants. Development of [[multidrug resistance]] by ''P. aeruginosa'' isolates requires several different genetic events that include acquisition of different mutations and/or horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes. Hypermutation favours the selection of mutation-driven antibiotic resistance in ''P. aeruginosa'' strains producing chronic infections, whereas the clustering of several different antibiotic resistance genes in [[integron]]s favours the concerted acquisition of antibiotic resistance determinants. Some recent studies have shown phenotypic resistance associated to [[biofilm]] formation or to the emergence of small-colony-variants, which may be important in the response of ''P. aeruginosa'' populations to [[antibiotic]] treatment.<ref name=\"Cornelis\"/>\n\n===Sensitivity to gallium===\nAlthough gallium has no natural function in biology, gallium ions interact with cellular processes in a manner similar to iron(III).  When gallium ions are mistakenly taken up in place of iron(III) by bacteria such as ''Pseudomonas'', the ions interfere with respiration, and the bacteria die. This happens because iron is redox-active, allowing the transfer of electrons during respiration, while gallium is redox-inactive.<ref>\"A Trojan-horse strategy selected to fight bacteria\".

Numerous other ''Pseudomonas'' species can act as plant pathogens, notably all of the other members of the ''P. syringae'' subgroup, but ''P. syringae'' is the most widespread and best-studied.\n\nAlthough not strictly a plant pathogen, ''[[Pseudomonas tolaasii|P. tolaasii]]'' can be a major agricultural problem, as it can cause bacterial blotch of cultivated [[mushrooms]].<ref name=Brodey_1991>{{cite journal | author=Brodey CL | author2=Rainey PB | author3=Tester M| author4=Johnstone K | title=Bacterial blotch disease of the cultivated mushroom is caused by an ion channel forming lipodepsipeptide toxin | journal=Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions | date=1991 | volume=1 | pages=407\u201311 | doi=10.1094/MPMI-4-407 | issue=4 }}</ref> Similarly, ''[[Pseudomonas agarici|P. agarici]]'' can cause drippy gill in cultivated mushrooms.<ref name=Young_1970>{{cite journal | author = Young JM | title = Drippy gill: a bacterial disease of cultivated mushrooms caused by ''Pseudomonas agarici'' n. sp | journal = NZ J Agric Res | date = 1970 | volume = 13 | pages = 977\u201390 | doi = 10.1080/00288233.1970.10430530 | issue = 4 }}</ref>\n\n== Use as biocontrol agents ==\nSince the mid-1980s, certain members of the genus ''Pseudomonas'' have been applied to cereal seeds or applied directly to soils as a way of preventing the growth or establishment of crop pathogens. This practice is generically referred to as [[biocontrol]]. The biocontrol properties of ''P. fluorescens'' and ''[[Pseudomonas protegens|P. protegens]]'' strains (CHA0 or Pf-5 for example) are currently best-understood, although it is not clear exactly how the plant growth-promoting properties of ''P. fluorescens'' are achieved. Theories include: the bacteria might induce systemic resistance in the host plant, so it can better resist attack by a true pathogen; the bacteria might outcompete other (pathogenic) soil microbes, e.g. by [[siderophore]]s giving a competitive advantage at scavenging for iron; the bacteria might produce compounds antagonistic to other soil microbes, such as [[phenazine]]-type antibiotics or [[hydrogen cyanide]]. Experimental evidence supports all of these theories.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Haas D |author2=Defago G |title=Biological control of soil-borne pathogens by fluorescent pseudomonads |journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=307\u2013319 |date=2005 |pmid=15759041 |doi=10.1038/nrmicro1129}}</ref>\n\nOther notable ''Pseudomonas'' species with biocontrol properties include ''[[Pseudomonas chlororaphis|P. chlororaphis]]'', which produces a [[phenazine]]-type [[antibiotic]] active agent against certain [[fungus|fungal]] plant pathogens,<ref>{{cite journal |display-authors=4 |author=Chin-A-Woeng TF |title=Root colonization by phenazine-1-carboxamide-producing bacterium ''Pseudomonas chlororaphis'' PCL1391 is essential for biocontrol of tomato foot and root rot |journal=Mol Plant Microbe Interact |volume=13 |issue=12 |pages=1340\u20131345 |date=2000 |pmid=11106026  |doi=10.1094/MPMI.2000.13.12.1340|last2=Bloemberg |first2=Guido V. |last3=Mulders |first3=Ine H.

Neither the younger nor the elder Pliny mention the names. Their ultimate source is a fragmentary inscription ([[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL V 1 3442]]) found in a field in [[Verona]] and recorded by the 16th-century [[Augustinian]] monk [[Onofrio Panvinio]] at Verona. The form is an elegy. The most commonly accepted reconstruction is\n{{quote|PLINIVS SECVNDVS AVGV. LERI. PATRI. MATRI. MARCELLAE. TESTAMENTO FIERI IVSSO}}\n\nThe Vs represent Us.

He kept statues of his ancestors there. Pliny the Elder was born at [[Como]], not at Verona: it is only as a native of old ''[[Gallia Cisalpina|Gallia Transpadana]]'' that he calls [[Catullus]] of Verona his ''conterraneus'', or fellow-countryman, not his ''municeps'', or fellow-townsman.<ref>{{SmithDGRBM|author=Charles Peter Mason|article=C.

He had a sister, Plinia, who married into the Caecilii and was the mother of his nephew, Pliny the Younger, whose letters describe his work and study regimen in detail.\n\nIn one of his letters to Tacitus (''avunculus meus''), Pliny the Younger details how his uncle's breakfasts would be light and simple (''levis et facilis'') following the customs of our forefathers (''veterum more interdiu''). This shows that Pliny the Younger wanted it to be conveyed that Pliny the Elder was a \"good Roman\", which means that he maintained the customs of the great Roman forefathers. This statement would have pleased Tacitus.\n\nTwo inscriptions identifying the hometown of Pliny the Younger as Como take precedence over the Verona theory. One ([[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL V 5262]]) commemorates the younger's career as the imperial magistrate and details his considerable charitable and municipal expenses on behalf of the people of Como. Another (CIL V 5667) identifies his father Lucius' village as Fecchio (tribe Oufentina) near Como. Therefore, Plinia likely was a local girl and Pliny the Elder, her brother, was from Como.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Appendix A: Inscriptions|title=The letters of the younger Pliny|author=Pliny the Younger|author2=Betty Radice (Editor, Translator, Contributor)|edition=6, revised, reprint, reissue, illustrated|publisher=Penguin Classics|year=1969|isbn=978-0-14-044127-7|url=https://archive.org/details/lettersofyounger00plin}}</ref>\n\nGaius was a member of the [[Plinia (gens)|Plinia]] ''[[gens]]:'' the [[Insubres|insubric]] root ''Plina'' still persists, with [[Rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacism]], in the local surname \"[[Prina (disambiguation)|Prina]]\". He did not take his father's [[cognomen]], Celer, but assumed his own, Secundus. As his adopted son took the same cognomen, Pliny founded a branch, the Plinii Secundi. The family was prosperous; Pliny the Younger's combined inherited estates made him so wealthy that he could found a school and a library, endow a fund to feed the women and children of Como, and own multiple estates around [[Rome]] and Lake Como, as well as enrich some of his friends as a personal favor. No earlier instances of the Plinii are known.\n\nIn 59 BC, only about 82 years before Pliny's birth, [[Julius Caesar]] founded Novum Comum (reverting to Comum) as a ''colonia'' to secure the region against the Alpine tribes, whom he had been unable to defeat. He imported a population of 4,500 from other provinces (not clear from where) to be placed in [[Comasco]] and 500 aristocratic Greeks to found Novum Comum itself.<ref>{{cite book|title=Some Problems in Roman History: Ten Essays Bearing on the Administrative and Legislative Work of Julius Caesar|first=Ernest George|last=Hardy|publisher=The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd|year=2007|isbn= 978-1-58477-753-3|chapter=V Caesar's Colony at Novum Comum in 59 BC|pages=126\u2013149}}</ref> The community was thus multi-ethnic and the Plinies could have come from anywhere; whether any conclusions can be drawn from Pliny's preference for Greek words, or [[Julius Pokorny]]'s derivation of the name from north Italic as \"bald\"<ref>{{cite web|first=Julius|last=Pokorny|title=Indogermanisches Etymologisches Woerterbuch|language=German|pages=834|publisher=University of Leiden|url=http://www.indoeuropean.nl/index2.html|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927151807/http://www.indoeuropean.nl/index2.html|archivedate=2006-09-27}}</ref> is a matter of speculative opinion. No record of any ethnic distinctions in Pliny's time is apparent; the population prided themselves on being Roman citizens.\n\nPliny the Elder did not marry and had no children. In his will, he adopted his nephew, which entitled the latter to inherit the entire estate. The adoption is called a \"testamental adoption\" by writers on the topic, who assert that it applied to the name change only, but Roman jurisprudence recognizes no such category. Pliny the Younger thus became the adopted son of Pliny the Elder after the latter's death.<ref name=\"Pliny the Younger 1896 1\">{{cite book|author=Pliny the Younger|author2=Constantine E.

Later, these friendships assisted his entry into the upper echelons of the state; however, he was trusted for his knowledge and ability, as well. According to Syme, he began as a ''praefectus cohortis'', a \"commander of a [[Cohort (military unit)|cohort]]\" (an infantry cohort, as junior officers began in the infantry), under [[Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo]], himself a writer (whose works did not survive) in [[Germania Inferior]].

Associated with the commander in the ''[[praetorium]]'', he became a familiar and close friend of Pomponius, who also was a man of letters.\n\nAt another uncertain date, Pliny was transferred back to [[Germania Inferior]]. Corbulo had moved on, assuming command in the east. This time, Pliny was promoted to ''praefectus alae'', \"commander of a wing\", responsible for a cavalry battalion of about 480 men.<ref name=PYIII.5>{{cite book |author=Pliny the Younger |title=Letters |chapter=III.5 To Baebius Macer |url=http://www.bartleby.com/9/4/1027.html}}</ref> He spent the rest of his military service there.

[[Glyptothek]], Munich]]\n\n===Literary interlude===\nAt the earliest time Pliny could have left the service, [[Nero]], the last of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]], had been emperor for two years. He did not leave office until AD 68, when Pliny was 45 years old. During that time, Pliny did not hold any high office or work in the service of the state. In the subsequent [[Flavian Dynasty]], his services were in such demand that he had to give up his law practice, which suggests that he had been trying not to attract the attention of Nero, who was a dangerous acquaintance.\n\nUnder Nero, Pliny lived mainly in Rome. He mentions the map of [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]] and the neighbourhood of the [[Caspian Sea]], which was sent to Rome by the staff of Corbulo in 58.<ref>{{cite book | title=Natural History | chapter=VI.15}}</ref><ref name=EB1911/> He also saw the building of Nero's [[Domus Aurea]] or \"Golden House\" after the fire of 64.<ref>{{cite book|title=Natural History|chapter=XXXVI.24}}</ref><ref name=EB1911/>\n\nBesides pleading law cases, Pliny wrote, researched, and studied. His second published work was a biography of his old commander, Pomponius Secundus, in two books.<ref name=PYIII.5/> After several years in prison under [[Tiberius]], AD 31-37 (which he used to write tragedies), Pomponius was rehabilitated by [[Caligula]] (who later married his half-sister, [[Caesonia]]) in 38, made consul in 41, and sent by Claudius as ''legatus'' to Germany, where he won a victory against the [[Chatti]] in 50 and was allowed a [[Roman triumph|triumph]]. After this peak, he disappears from history, never to be mentioned again, except by the Plinies, and is not among either the friends or the enemies of Nero.\n\nThe elder Pliny mentions that he saw \"in the possession of Pomponius Secundus, the poet, a very illustrious citizen\", manuscripts in the \"ancient handwriting of Tiberius and Caius Gracchus\".<ref>{{cite book | title=Natural History | chapter=XIII.26}}</ref> The peak of Pomponius's fame would have been his triumph of 50 or 51. In 54, Nero came to power; at that time, Pliny was working on his two military writings. Pliny the Younger says that the biography of Pomponius was \"a duty which he owed to the memory of his friend\", implying that Pomponius had died. The circumstances of this duty and whether or not it had anything to do with his probable avoidance of Nero have disappeared with the work.\n\nMeanwhile, he was completing the 20 books of his ''History of the German Wars'', the only authority expressly quoted in the first six books of the ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' of [[Tacitus]],<ref>{{cite book | author=Tacitus | title=The Annals | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0078&layout=&loc=1.69 | chapter=I.69}}</ref><ref name=EB1911/> and probably one of the principal authorities for the same author's ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]''. It disappeared in favor of the writings of Tacitus (which are far shorter), and, early in the fifth century, [[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus|Symmachus]] had little hope of finding a copy.<ref>{{cite book|author=Symmachus|title=Letters|chapter=IV.18}}</ref><ref name=EB1911/>\n\nLike Caligula, Nero seemed to grow gradually more insane as his reign progressed. Pliny devoted much of his time to writing on the comparatively safe subjects of [[grammar]] and rhetoric.<ref name=EB1911/> He published a three-book, six-volume educational manual on rhetoric, entitled ''Studiosus'', \"the Student\". Pliny the Younger says of it: \"The orator is trained from his very cradle and perfected.\"<ref name=PYIII.5/> It was followed by eight books entitled ''Dubii sermonis'',<ref name=EB1911/> ''Of Doubtful Phraseology''. These are both now [[lost work]]s. His nephew relates: \"He wrote this under Nero, in the last years of his reign, when every kind of literary pursuit which was in the least independent or elevated had been rendered dangerous by servitude.\"\n\nIn 68, Nero no longer had any friends and supporters. He committed suicide, and the reign of terror was at an end, as was the interlude in Pliny's obligation to the state.\n\n===Senior officer===\n[[File:Vespasianus03 pushkin.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bust of [[Vespasian]], [[Pushkin Museum]], [[Moscow]]]]\n\nAt the end of AD 69, after a year of civil war consequent on the death of Nero, [[Vespasian]], a successful general, became emperor. Like Pliny, he had come from the equestrian class, rising through the ranks of the army and public offices and defeating the other contenders for the highest office. His main tasks were to re-establish peace under imperial control and to place the economy on a sound footing. He needed in his administration all the loyalty and assistance he could find. Pliny, apparently trusted without question, perhaps (reading between the lines) recommended by Vespasian's son Titus, was put to work immediately and was kept in a continuous succession of the most distinguished procuratorships, according to [[Suetonius]].<ref>Syme (1969), p. 224.</ref> A [[procurator (Roman)|procurator]] was generally a governor of an imperial province. The empire was perpetually short of, and was always seeking, office holders for its numerous offices.\n\nThroughout the latter stages of Pliny's life, he maintained good relations with Emperor Vespasian. As is written in the first line of Pliny the Younger's ''avunculus meus'':\n\n{{quote|{{lang|la|Ante lucem ibat ad Vespasianum imperatorem (nam ille quoque noctibus utebatur), deinde ad officium sibi delegatum}}\n\nBefore dawn he was going to the Emperor Vespasian (for he also made use of the night), then he did the other duties assigned to him.}}\n\nIn this passage, Pliny the Younger conveys to Tacitus that his uncle was ever the academic, always working. The word ''ibat'' (imperfect, \"he used to go\") gives a sense of repeated or customary action. In the subsequent text, he mentions again how most of his uncle's day was spent working, reading, and writing. He notes that Pliny \"was indeed a very ready sleeper, sometimes dropping off in the middle of his studies and then waking up again.\"<ref>Epistles, III v</ref>\n\nA definitive study of the procuratorships of Pliny was compiled by the classical scholar [[Friedrich M\u00fcnzer]], which was reasserted by [[Ronald Syme]] and became a standard reference point. M\u00fcnzer hypothesized four procuratorships, of which two are certainly attested and two are probable but not certain. However, two does not satisfy Suetonius' description of a continuous succession.<ref>Griffin (1992), p. 439.</ref> Consequently, Plinian scholars present two to four procuratorships, the four comprising (i) Gallia Narbonensis in 70, (ii) Africa in 70-72, (iii) Hispania Tarraconensis in 72-74, and (iv) Gallia Belgica in 74-76.\n\nAccording to Syme, Pliny may have been \"successor to Valerius Paulinus\", procurator of [[Gallia Narbonensis]] (southeastern France), early in AD 70. He seems to have a \"familiarity with the ''provincia''\", which, however, might otherwise be explained.<ref>Syme (1969), p. 225.</ref> For example, he says<ref>{{cite book|title=Natural History|chapter=III.5 (.4)}}</ref> <blockquote>In the cultivation of the soil, the manners and civilization of the inhabitants, and the extent of its wealth, it is surpassed by none of the provinces, and, in short, might be more truthfully described as a part of Italy than as a province.</blockquote>\ndenoting a general popular familiarity with the region.\n\n[[File:Palmeraie gab\u00e8s2.jpg|thumb|left|Oasis at [[Gab\u00e8s]]]]\n\nPliny certainly  spent some time in [[Africa Province]], most likely as a procurator.<ref>Syme (1969), pp. 214-215.</ref> Among other events or features that he saw are the provoking of ''rubetae'', poisonous toads ([[Bufonidae]]), by the [[Psylli]];<ref>{{cite book |title= Natural History |chapter= XXV.76 \n|quote= I myself have seen the Psylli, in their exhibitions,<!--\n--> irritate them by placing them upon flat vessels made red hot,<!--\n--> their bite being fatal more instantaneously than the sting even of the asp.}}</ref><!--\n--> the buildings made with molded earthen walls, \"superior in solidity to any cement;\"<ref>{{cite book |title= Natural History |chapter=XXXV.48 (14.)}}</ref> and the unusual, fertile seaside oasis of [[Gab\u00e8s]] (then Tacape), Tunisia, currently a [[World Heritage Site]].<ref>{{cite book |title= Natural History |chapter= XVIII.51}}</ref> Syme assigns the African procuratorship to AD&nbsp;70-72.\n\nThe procuratorship of [[Hispania Tarraconensis]] was next. A statement by Pliny the Younger that his uncle was offered 400,000 ''[[sesterce]]s'' for his manuscripts by Larcius Licinius while he (Pliny the Elder) was procurator of Hispania makes it the most certain of the three.<ref name=PYIII.5/> Pliny lists the peoples of \"Hither Hispania\", including population statistics and civic rights (modern [[Asturias]] and [[Gallaecia]]). He stops short of mentioning them all for fear of \"wearying the reader\".<ref>{{cite book |title= Natural History |chapter= III.4 (.3) Of Nearer Spain}}</ref> As this is the only geographic region for which he gives this information, Syme hypothesizes that Pliny contributed to the census of Hither Hispania conducted in 73/74 by Vibius Crispus, legate from the Emperor, thus dating Pliny's procuratorship there.<ref>Syme (1969), p. 216.</ref>\n\n[[File:Panor\u00e1mica de Las M\u00e9dulas.jpg |thumb|right|[[Las M\u00e9dulas]], Spain, site of a large Roman mine]]\n\nDuring his stay in Hispania, he became familiar with the agriculture and especially the gold mines of the north and west of the country.<ref>{{cite book|title=Natural History | chapter=XXXIII.21 | quote=Asturia, Gall\u00e6cia, and Lusitania furnish in this manner, yearly, according to some authorities, twenty thousand pounds' weight of gold, the produce of Asturia forming the major part.

He might have visited the mine excavated at [[Las M\u00e9dulas]].\n\n[[File:Trier Porta Nigra BW 1.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Porta Nigra]] Roman gate, [[Trier]], Germany]]\n\nThe last position of procurator, an uncertain one, was of [[Gallia Belgica]], based on Pliny's familiarity with it. The capital of the province was Augusta Treverorum ([[History of Trier|Trier]]), named for the [[Treveri]] surrounding it. Pliny says that in \"the year but one before this\" a severe winter killed the first crops planted by the Treviri; they sowed again in March and had \"a most abundant harvest.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Natural History|chapter=XVIII.49 (.19)}}</ref> The problem is to identify \"this\", the year in which the passage was written. Using 77 as the date of composition Syme<ref>Syme (1969), p. 213.</ref> arrives at AD 74-75 as the date of the procuratorship, when Pliny is presumed to have witnessed these events. The argument is based entirely on presumptions; nevertheless, this date is required to achieve Suetonius' continuity of procuratorships, if the one in Gallia Belgica occurred.\n\nPliny was allowed home (Rome) at some time in AD 75\u201376. He was presumably at home for the first official release of ''Natural History'' in 77. Whether he was in Rome for the dedication of Vespasian's Temple of Peace in the Forum in 75, which was in essence a museum for display of art works plundered by Nero and formerly adorning the Domus Aurea, is uncertain, as is his possible command of the ''vigiles'' (night watchmen), a lesser post. No actual post is discernible for this period. On the bare circumstances, he was an official agent of the emperor in a quasiprivate capacity. Perhaps he was between posts. In any case, his appointment as prefect of the fleet at Misenum took him there, where he resided with his sister and nephew. Vespasian died of disease on June 23, 79. Pliny outlived him by two months.\n\n===Noted author===\nDuring Nero's reign of terror, Pliny avoided working on any writing that would attract attention to himself. His works on oratory in the last years of Nero's reign (67, 68) focused on form rather than on content. He began working on content again probably after Vespasian's rule began in AD 69, when  the terror clearly was over and would not be resumed. It was to some degree reinstituted (and later cancelled by his son Titus) when Vespasian suppressed the philosophers at Rome, but not Pliny, who was not among them, representing, as he says, something new in Rome, an encyclopedist (certainly, a venerable tradition outside Italy).\n\nIn his next work, he \"completed the history which [[Aufidius Bassus]] left unfinished, and... added to it thirty books.\"<ref name=PYIII.5/> Aufidius Bassus was a ''cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre'' according to [[Seneca the Younger]],<ref>{{cite book|author=Seneca the Younger|title=Moral Letters|chapter=30|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_30}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |page=179 |title=Ambitiosa mors: suicide and self in Roman thought and literature|first=Timothy |last=Hill|publisher= Routledge|year=2004 |isbn= 978-0-415-97097-6 |series=Studies in Classics Volume 10}}</ref> a man much admired at Rome. He had begun his history with some unknown date, certainly before the death of Cicero,<ref>{{cite book|author=Seneca the Elder|title=Suasoriae|chapter=6.18.23}}</ref> so probably the [[Roman civil wars|Civil Wars]] or the death of [[Julius Caesar]], ending with the reign of [[Tiberius]]. It was cut short when Bassus died slowly of a lingering disease, with such spirit and objectivity that Seneca remarked that Bassus seemed to treat it as someone else's dying.\n\nPliny's continuation of Bassus's ''History'' was one of the authorities followed by [[Lives of the Twelve Caesars|Suetonius]] and [[Plutarch]].<ref name=EB1911/> Tacitus also cites Pliny as a source. He is mentioned concerning the loyalty of [[Burrus]], commander of the [[Praetorian Guard]], whom [[Nero]] removed for disloyalty.<ref>{{cite book|author=Tacitus|title=The Annals|chapter=13.20|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0078&layout=&loc=13.20}}</ref> Tacitus portrays parts of Pliny's view of the [[Pisonian conspiracy]] to kill Nero and make Piso emperor as \"absurd\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Tacitus|title=The Annals|chapter=15.53|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0078&layout=&loc=15.53}}</ref> and mentions that he could not decide whether Pliny's account or that of [[Marcus Valerius Messala Corvinus (consul 58)|Messalla]] was more accurate concerning some of the details of the [[Year of the Four Emperors]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Tacitus |title=The Histories|chapter=3.29 |url=http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/tacitus/TacitusHistory03.html}}</ref> Evidently Pliny's extension of Bassus extended at least from the reign of Nero to that of Vespasian. Pliny seems to have known it was going to be controversial, as he deliberately reserved it for publication after his death:<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n<blockquote>\nIt has been long completed and its accuracy confirmed; but I have determined to commit the charge of it to my heirs, lest I should have been suspected, during my lifetime, of having been unduly influenced by ambition. By this means I confer an obligation on those who occupy the same ground with myself; and also on posterity, who, I am aware, will contend with me, as I have done with my predecessors.<ref>{{cite book | author=Pliny | title=Natural History | url=https://archive.org/details/naturalhistory08plinuoft | chapter=Preface, 20}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==''Natural History''==\n{{Main|Natural History (Pliny)}}\nPliny's last work, according to his nephew, was the ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]'' (literally \"Natural History\"), an [[encyclopedia]] into which he collected much of the knowledge of his time.<ref name=PYIII.5/> It comprised 37 books. His sources were personal experience, his own prior works (such as the work on [[Germania]]), and extracts from other works. These extracts were collected in the following manner: One servant would read aloud, and another would write the extract as dictated by Pliny. He is said to have dictated extracts while taking a bath. In winter, he furnished the copier with gloves and long sleeves so his writing hand would not stiffen with cold (Pliny the Younger in ''avunculus meus''). His extract collection finally reached about 160 volumes, which Larcius Licinius, the [[legatus|Praetorian legate]] of Hispania Tarraconensis, vainly offered to purchase for 400,000 ''sesterces.''<ref name=PYIII.5/><ref name=EB1911/> That would have been in 73/74 (see above). Pliny bequeathed the extracts to his nephew.\n\nWhen composition of the'' Natural History'' began is unknown. Since he was preoccupied with his other works under Nero and then had to finish the history of his times, he  is unlikely to have begun before 70. The procuratorships offered the ideal opportunity for an encyclopedic frame of mind. The date of an overall composition cannot be assigned to any one year. The dates of different parts must be determined, if they can, by [[Philology|philological]] analysis (the ''post mortem'' of the scholars).\n\n[[File:Laocoon Pio-Clementino Inv1059-1064-1067.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|''[[Laocoon and his Sons]]'', a sculpture admired by Pliny]]\n\nThe closest known event to a single publication date, that is, when the manuscript was probably released to the public for borrowing and copying, and was probably sent to the Flavians, is the date of the Dedication in the first of the 37 books. It is to the ''[[imperator]]'' Titus. As Titus and Vespasian had the same name, Titus Flavius Vespasianus, earlier writers hypothesized a dedication to Vespasian. Pliny's mention of a brother ([[Domitian]]) and joint offices with a father, calling that father \"great\", points certainly to Titus.<ref name=B7>Beagon (2005), p. 7.</ref>\n\nPliny also says that Titus had been [[Roman consul|consul]] six times. The first six consulships of Titus are in 70, 72, 74, 75, 76, and 77, all conjointly with Vespasian, and the seventh was in 79. This brings the date of the Dedication probably to 77. In that year, Vespasian was 68. He had been ruling conjointly with Titus for some years.<ref name=B7/> The title ''imperator'' does not indicate that Titus was sole emperor, but was awarded for a military victory, in this case that in Jerusalem in 70.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luc.edu/roman-emperors/titus.htm|title=Roman Emperors - DIR Titus|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAside from minor finishing touches, the work in 37 books was completed in AD 77.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The New Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|edition=15|year=1977|volume=14|page=572a}}</ref> That it was written entirely in 77 or that Pliny was finished with it then cannot be proved. Moreover, the dedication could have been written before publication, and it could have been published either privately or publicly earlier without the dedication. The only certain fact is that Pliny did no further work on it after AD 79.\n\nThe ''Naturalis Historia'' is one of the largest single works to have survived from the Roman Empire to the modern day and purports to cover the entire field of ancient knowledge, based on the best authorities available to Pliny. He claims to be the only Roman ever to have undertaken such a work. It encompasses the fields of [[botany]], [[zoology]], [[astronomy]], [[geology]], and [[mineralogy]], as well as the exploitation of those resources. It remains a standard work for the Roman period and the advances in technology and understanding of natural phenomena at the time. His discussions of some technical advances are the only sources for those inventions, such as [[hushing]] in mining technology or the use of [[water mill]]s for crushing or grinding corn. Much of what he wrote about has been confirmed by [[archaeology]]. It is virtually the only work which describes the work of artists of the time, and is a reference work for the [[history of art]]. As such, Pliny's approach to describing the work of artists was to inform [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] in writing his commentaries and [[Giorgio Vasari]] who wrote the celebrated ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects]]''.\n\nThe work became a model for all later encyclopedias in terms of the breadth of subject matter examined, the need to reference original authors, and a comprehensive index list of the contents. It is the only work by Pliny to have survived, and the last that he published, lacking a final revision at his sudden and unexpected death in the AD 79 eruption of Vesuvius.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Pompeii Garden of the Fugitives 02.jpg|thumb|right|Plaster casts of the casualties of the pumice fall, whose remains vanished, leaving cavities in the pumice at [[Pompeii]]]]\nPliny had received from Emperor Vespasian, who had died two months earlier, the appointment of ''[[praefectus]] classis'' ([[Roman navy#High Command|fleet commander]]) in the [[Roman Navy]]. He was stationed at [[Misenum]], at the time of the great [[volcanic eruption|eruption]] of [[Mount Vesuvius]],<ref name=EB1911/> which destroyed and  buried [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]]. He was preparing to cross the [[Bay of Naples]] to observe the phenomenon directly when a message  arrived from  his friend [[Rectina]] asking to rescue [[Pomponianus]] and her. Launching the galleys under his command to the evacuation of the opposite shore, he himself took \"a fast-sailing cutter\", a decision that may have cost him his life. His nephew, Pliny the Younger, provided an account of his death, obtained from the survivors. The nephew and his mother had decided not to go on the voyage across the bay.\n\nAs the light vessel approached the shore near Herculaneum, cinders and pumice began to fall on it. Pliny's helmsman advised turning back, to which Pliny replied, \"[[Fortune favours the brave]]; steer to where Pomponianus is.\" ([[Stabiae]], near the modern town of [[Castellammare di Stabia]].) They landed and found Pomponianus \"in the greatest consternation.\" Pliny hugged and comforted him. They could not find Rectina. They loaded the cutter, but the same winds that brought it to Stabiae prevented it from leaving. Pliny reassured his party by feasting, bathing, and sleeping while waiting for the wind to abate, but finally they had to leave the buildings for fear of collapse and try their luck in the pumice fall. Pliny sat down and could not get up even with assistance, and was left behind. His companions theorized that he collapsed and died through inhaling poisonous gases emitted from the volcano. On their return two days later after the plume had dispersed, his body was found under the pumice with no apparent external injuries. The problem with the toxicity theory is that his companions were unaffected by the same fumes, and they had no mobility problems, whereas Pliny had to sit and could not rise. As he is described as a corpulent man,<ref name=PYVI.16>{{cite book|author=Pliny the Younger|chapter=VI.16 To Tacitus|title=Letters|url=http://www.bartleby.com/9/4/1065.html}}</ref> who also suffered from [[asthma]],  his friends are thought to have left him because he was already dead.<ref name=littell>{{cite journal|title=Death of Pliny the Elder|first=Jacob, MD|last=Bigelow|page=123|journal=Littell's Living Age|editor-first=E.|editor-last=Littell|series=Third|volume=V|date=1859|location=Boston|publisher=Littell, Son, and Company}}</ref>\n\nThe story of his last hours is told in a letter addressed 27 years afterwards to Tacitus by  Pliny the Younger,<ref name=PYVI.16/><ref name=EB1911/> who also sent to another correspondent, [[Baebius Macer]], an account of his uncle's writings and his manner of life.<ref name=\"PYIII.5\"/><ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|last=Sands |first=John Edwin |wstitle=Pliny the Elder|volume=21 |pages=841\u2013844 |inline=1}}</ref> The fragment from Suetonius (see under \"External links\" below) states a somewhat less flattering view, that Pliny approached the shore only from scientific interest and then asked a slave to kill him to avoid heat from the volcano. It is not as credible a source, as it is clear from the nephew's letter that the persons Pliny came to rescue escaped to tell the tale in detail. Moreover, Suetonius hypothesizes that a party witnessing events so agonizing as to destroy Pliny or cause him to order his own death are suspect as they apparently were subject to none of these fatal events themselves.\n\nIn 1859, Jacob Bigelow, M.D., after summarizing the widespread misinformation about Pliny's death, examined the evidence and concluded that Pliny was overweight, in poor health, and died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. <ref>Bigelow, Jacob. (1859). ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/25057949|On the Death of Pliny the Elder]'', ''Memoirs of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences'' Vol. 6, No. 2 (1859), pp. 223-227.</ref> In 1967, science historian [[Conway Zirkle]] similarly stated that \"there is widespread and persisting misinformation\" about Pliny's death. He suggested that despite his rescue attempt, Pliny never came within miles of Vesuvius and no evidence has been found that shows he died from breathing in fumes, and like Bigelow, concluded that he died of a heart attack.<ref>Zirkle, Conway.

Neither the younger nor the elder Pliny mention the names. Their ultimate source is a fragmentary inscription ([[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL V 1 3442]]) found in a field in [[Verona]] and recorded by the 16th-century [[Augustinian]] monk [[Onofrio Panvinio]] at Verona. The form is an elegy. The most commonly accepted reconstruction is\n{{quote|PLINIVS SECVNDVS AVGV. LERI. PATRI. MATRI. MARCELLAE. TESTAMENTO FIERI IVSSO}}\n\nThe Vs represent Us.

He kept statues of his ancestors there. Pliny the Elder was born at [[Como]], not at Verona: it is only as a native of old ''[[Gallia Cisalpina|Gallia Transpadana]]'' that he calls [[Catullus]] of Verona his ''conterraneus'', or fellow-countryman, not his ''municeps'', or fellow-townsman.<ref>{{SmithDGRBM|author=Charles Peter Mason|article=C.

He had a sister, Plinia, who married into the Caecilii and was the mother of his nephew, Pliny the Younger, whose letters describe his work and study regimen in detail.\n\nIn one of his letters to Tacitus (''avunculus meus''), Pliny the Younger details how his uncle's breakfasts would be light and simple (''levis et facilis'') following the customs of our forefathers (''veterum more interdiu''). This shows that Pliny the Younger wanted it to be conveyed that Pliny the Elder was a \"good Roman\", which means that he maintained the customs of the great Roman forefathers. This statement would have pleased Tacitus.\n\nTwo inscriptions identifying the hometown of Pliny the Younger as Como take precedence over the Verona theory. One ([[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL V 5262]]) commemorates the younger's career as the imperial magistrate and details his considerable charitable and municipal expenses on behalf of the people of Como. Another (CIL V 5667) identifies his father Lucius' village as Fecchio (tribe Oufentina) near Como. Therefore, Plinia likely was a local girl and Pliny the Elder, her brother, was from Como.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Appendix A: Inscriptions|title=The letters of the younger Pliny|author=Pliny the Younger|author2=Betty Radice (Editor, Translator, Contributor)|edition=6, revised, reprint, reissue, illustrated|publisher=Penguin Classics|year=1969|isbn=978-0-14-044127-7|url=https://archive.org/details/lettersofyounger00plin}}</ref>\n\nGaius was a member of the [[Plinia (gens)|Plinia]] ''[[gens]]:'' the [[Insubres|insubric]] root ''Plina'' still persists, with [[Rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacism]], in the local surname \"[[Prina (disambiguation)|Prina]]\". He did not take his father's [[cognomen]], Celer, but assumed his own, Secundus. As his adopted son took the same cognomen, Pliny founded a branch, the Plinii Secundi. The family was prosperous; Pliny the Younger's combined inherited estates made him so wealthy that he could found a school and a library, endow a fund to feed the women and children of Como, and own multiple estates around [[Rome]] and Lake Como, as well as enrich some of his friends as a personal favor. No earlier instances of the Plinii are known.\n\nIn 59 BC, only about 82 years before Pliny's birth, [[Julius Caesar]] founded Novum Comum (reverting to Comum) as a ''colonia'' to secure the region against the Alpine tribes, whom he had been unable to defeat.

In his will, he adopted his nephew, which entitled the latter to inherit the entire estate. The adoption is called a \"testamental adoption\" by writers on the topic, who assert that it applied to the name change only, but Roman jurisprudence recognizes no such category.

Later, these friendships assisted his entry into the upper echelons of the state; however, he was trusted for his knowledge and ability, as well. According to Syme, he began as a ''praefectus cohortis'', a \"commander of a [[Cohort (military unit)|cohort]]\" (an infantry cohort, as junior officers began in the infantry), under [[Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo]], himself a writer (whose works did not survive) in [[Germania Inferior]].

Associated with the commander in the ''[[praetorium]]'', he became a familiar and close friend of Pomponius, who also was a man of letters.\n\nAt another uncertain date, Pliny was transferred back to [[Germania Inferior]].

[[Glyptothek]], Munich]]\n\n===Literary interlude===\nAt the earliest time Pliny could have left the service, [[Nero]], the last of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]], had been emperor for two years. He did not leave office until AD 68, when Pliny was 45 years old. During that time, Pliny did not hold any high office or work in the service of the state. In the subsequent [[Flavian Dynasty]], his services were in such demand that he had to give up his law practice, which suggests that he had been trying not to attract the attention of Nero, who was a dangerous acquaintance.\n\nUnder Nero, Pliny lived mainly in Rome. He mentions the map of [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]] and the neighbourhood of the [[Caspian Sea]], which was sent to Rome by the staff of Corbulo in 58.<ref>{{cite book | title=Natural History | chapter=VI.15}}</ref><ref name=EB1911/> He also saw the building of Nero's [[Domus Aurea]] or \"Golden House\" after the fire of 64.<ref>{{cite book|title=Natural History|chapter=XXXVI.24}}</ref><ref name=EB1911/>\n\nBesides pleading law cases, Pliny wrote, researched, and studied. His second published work was a biography of his old commander, Pomponius Secundus, in two books.<ref name=PYIII.5/> After several years in prison under [[Tiberius]], AD 31-37 (which he used to write tragedies), Pomponius was rehabilitated by [[Caligula]] (who later married his half-sister, [[Caesonia]]) in 38, made consul in 41, and sent by Claudius as ''legatus'' to Germany, where he won a victory against the [[Chatti]] in 50 and was allowed a [[Roman triumph|triumph]]. After this peak, he disappears from history, never to be mentioned again, except by the Plinies, and is not among either the friends or the enemies of Nero.\n\nThe elder Pliny mentions that he saw \"in the possession of Pomponius Secundus, the poet, a very illustrious citizen\", manuscripts in the \"ancient handwriting of Tiberius and Caius Gracchus\".<ref>{{cite book | title=Natural History | chapter=XIII.26}}</ref> The peak of Pomponius's fame would have been his triumph of 50 or 51. In 54, Nero came to power; at that time, Pliny was working on his two military writings. Pliny the Younger says that the biography of Pomponius was \"a duty which he owed to the memory of his friend\", implying that Pomponius had died. The circumstances of this duty and whether or not it had anything to do with his probable avoidance of Nero have disappeared with the work.\n\nMeanwhile, he was completing the 20 books of his ''History of the German Wars'', the only authority expressly quoted in the first six books of the ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' of [[Tacitus]],<ref>{{cite book | author=Tacitus | title=The Annals | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0078&layout=&loc=1.69 | chapter=I.69}}</ref><ref name=EB1911/> and probably one of the principal authorities for the same author's ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]''. It disappeared in favor of the writings of Tacitus (which are far shorter), and, early in the fifth century, [[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus|Symmachus]] had little hope of finding a copy.<ref>{{cite book|author=Symmachus|title=Letters|chapter=IV.18}}</ref><ref name=EB1911/>\n\nLike Caligula, Nero seemed to grow gradually more insane as his reign progressed. Pliny devoted much of his time to writing on the comparatively safe subjects of [[grammar]] and rhetoric.<ref name=EB1911/> He published a three-book, six-volume educational manual on rhetoric, entitled ''Studiosus'', \"the Student\". Pliny the Younger says of it: \"The orator is trained from his very cradle and perfected.\"<ref name=PYIII.5/> It was followed by eight books entitled ''Dubii sermonis'',<ref name=EB1911/> ''Of Doubtful Phraseology''. These are both now [[lost work]]s. His nephew relates: \"He wrote this under Nero, in the last years of his reign, when every kind of literary pursuit which was in the least independent or elevated had been rendered dangerous by servitude.\"\n\nIn 68, Nero no longer had any friends and supporters. He committed suicide, and the reign of terror was at an end, as was the interlude in Pliny's obligation to the state.\n\n===Senior officer===\n[[File:Vespasianus03 pushkin.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bust of [[Vespasian]], [[Pushkin Museum]], [[Moscow]]]]\n\nAt the end of AD 69, after a year of civil war consequent on the death of Nero, [[Vespasian]], a successful general, became emperor. Like Pliny, he had come from the equestrian class, rising through the ranks of the army and public offices and defeating the other contenders for the highest office. His main tasks were to re-establish peace under imperial control and to place the economy on a sound footing. He needed in his administration all the loyalty and assistance he could find. Pliny, apparently trusted without question, perhaps (reading between the lines) recommended by Vespasian's son Titus, was put to work immediately and was kept in a continuous succession of the most distinguished procuratorships, according to [[Suetonius]].<ref>Syme (1969), p. 224.</ref> A [[procurator (Roman)|procurator]] was generally a governor of an imperial province. The empire was perpetually short of, and was always seeking, office holders for its numerous offices.\n\nThroughout the latter stages of Pliny's life, he maintained good relations with Emperor Vespasian. As is written in the first line of Pliny the Younger's ''avunculus meus'':\n\n{{quote|{{lang|la|Ante lucem ibat ad Vespasianum imperatorem (nam ille quoque noctibus utebatur), deinde ad officium sibi delegatum}}\n\nBefore dawn he was going to the Emperor Vespasian (for he also made use of the night), then he did the other duties assigned to him.}}\n\nIn this passage, Pliny the Younger conveys to Tacitus that his uncle was ever the academic, always working. The word ''ibat'' (imperfect, \"he used to go\") gives a sense of repeated or customary action. In the subsequent text, he mentions again how most of his uncle's day was spent working, reading, and writing. He notes that Pliny \"was indeed a very ready sleeper, sometimes dropping off in the middle of his studies and then waking up again.\"<ref>Epistles, III v</ref>\n\nA definitive study of the procuratorships of Pliny was compiled by the classical scholar [[Friedrich M\u00fcnzer]], which was reasserted by [[Ronald Syme]] and became a standard reference point. M\u00fcnzer hypothesized four procuratorships, of which two are certainly attested and two are probable but not certain. However, two does not satisfy Suetonius' description of a continuous succession.<ref>Griffin (1992), p. 439.</ref> Consequently, Plinian scholars present two to four procuratorships, the four comprising (i) Gallia Narbonensis in 70, (ii) Africa in 70-72, (iii) Hispania Tarraconensis in 72-74, and (iv) Gallia Belgica in 74-76.\n\nAccording to Syme, Pliny may have been \"successor to Valerius Paulinus\", procurator of [[Gallia Narbonensis]] (southeastern France), early in AD 70. He seems to have a \"familiarity with the ''provincia''\", which, however, might otherwise be explained.<ref>Syme (1969), p. 225.</ref> For example, he says<ref>{{cite book|title=Natural History|chapter=III.5 (.4)}}</ref> <blockquote>In the cultivation of the soil, the manners and civilization of the inhabitants, and the extent of its wealth, it is surpassed by none of the provinces, and, in short, might be more truthfully described as a part of Italy than as a province.</blockquote>\ndenoting a general popular familiarity with the region.\n\n[[File:Palmeraie gab\u00e8s2.jpg|thumb|left|Oasis at [[Gab\u00e8s]]]]\n\nPliny certainly  spent some time in [[Africa Province]], most likely as a procurator.<ref>Syme (1969), pp. 214-215.</ref> Among other events or features that he saw are the provoking of ''rubetae'', poisonous toads ([[Bufonidae]]), by the [[Psylli]];<ref>{{cite book |title= Natural History |chapter= XXV.76 \n|quote= I myself have seen the Psylli, in their exhibitions,<!--\n--> irritate them by placing them upon flat vessels made red hot,<!--\n--> their bite being fatal more instantaneously than the sting even of the asp.}}</ref><!--\n--> the buildings made with molded earthen walls, \"superior in solidity to any cement;\"<ref>{{cite book |title= Natural History |chapter=XXXV.48 (14.)}}</ref> and the unusual, fertile seaside oasis of [[Gab\u00e8s]] (then Tacape), Tunisia, currently a [[World Heritage Site]].<ref>{{cite book |title= Natural History |chapter= XVIII.51}}</ref> Syme assigns the African procuratorship to AD&nbsp;70-72.\n\nThe procuratorship of [[Hispania Tarraconensis]] was next. A statement by Pliny the Younger that his uncle was offered 400,000 ''[[sesterce]]s'' for his manuscripts by Larcius Licinius while he (Pliny the Elder) was procurator of Hispania makes it the most certain of the three.<ref name=PYIII.5/> Pliny lists the peoples of \"Hither Hispania\", including population statistics and civic rights (modern [[Asturias]] and [[Gallaecia]]). He stops short of mentioning them all for fear of \"wearying the reader\".<ref>{{cite book |title= Natural History |chapter= III.4 (.3) Of Nearer Spain}}</ref> As this is the only geographic region for which he gives this information, Syme hypothesizes that Pliny contributed to the census of Hither Hispania conducted in 73/74 by Vibius Crispus, legate from the Emperor, thus dating Pliny's procuratorship there.<ref>Syme (1969), p. 216.</ref>\n\n[[File:Panor\u00e1mica de Las M\u00e9dulas.jpg |thumb|right|[[Las M\u00e9dulas]], Spain, site of a large Roman mine]]\n\nDuring his stay in Hispania, he became familiar with the agriculture and especially the gold mines of the north and west of the country.<ref>{{cite book|title=Natural History | chapter=XXXIII.21 | quote=Asturia, Gall\u00e6cia, and Lusitania furnish in this manner, yearly, according to some authorities, twenty thousand pounds' weight of gold, the produce of Asturia forming the major part.

He might have visited the mine excavated at [[Las M\u00e9dulas]].\n\n[[File:Trier Porta Nigra BW 1.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Porta Nigra]] Roman gate, [[Trier]], Germany]]\n\nThe last position of procurator, an uncertain one, was of [[Gallia Belgica]], based on Pliny's familiarity with it. The capital of the province was Augusta Treverorum ([[History of Trier|Trier]]), named for the [[Treveri]] surrounding it. Pliny says that in \"the year but one before this\" a severe winter killed the first crops planted by the Treviri; they sowed again in March and had \"a most abundant harvest.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Natural History|chapter=XVIII.49 (.19)}}</ref> The problem is to identify \"this\", the year in which the passage was written. Using 77 as the date of composition Syme<ref>Syme (1969), p. 213.</ref> arrives at AD 74-75 as the date of the procuratorship, when Pliny is presumed to have witnessed these events. The argument is based entirely on presumptions; nevertheless, this date is required to achieve Suetonius' continuity of procuratorships, if the one in Gallia Belgica occurred.\n\nPliny was allowed home (Rome) at some time in AD 75\u201376. He was presumably at home for the first official release of ''Natural History'' in 77. Whether he was in Rome for the dedication of Vespasian's Temple of Peace in the Forum in 75, which was in essence a museum for display of art works plundered by Nero and formerly adorning the Domus Aurea, is uncertain, as is his possible command of the ''vigiles'' (night watchmen), a lesser post. No actual post is discernible for this period. On the bare circumstances, he was an official agent of the emperor in a quasiprivate capacity. Perhaps he was between posts. In any case, his appointment as prefect of the fleet at Misenum took him there, where he resided with his sister and nephew. Vespasian died of disease on June 23, 79. Pliny outlived him by two months.\n\n===Noted author===\nDuring Nero's reign of terror, Pliny avoided working on any writing that would attract attention to himself. His works on oratory in the last years of Nero's reign (67, 68) focused on form rather than on content. He began working on content again probably after Vespasian's rule began in AD 69, when  the terror clearly was over and would not be resumed. It was to some degree reinstituted (and later cancelled by his son Titus) when Vespasian suppressed the philosophers at Rome, but not Pliny, who was not among them, representing, as he says, something new in Rome, an encyclopedist (certainly, a venerable tradition outside Italy).\n\nIn his next work, he \"completed the history which [[Aufidius Bassus]] left unfinished, and... added to it thirty books.\"<ref name=PYIII.5/> Aufidius Bassus was a ''cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre'' according to [[Seneca the Younger]],<ref>{{cite book|author=Seneca the Younger|title=Moral Letters|chapter=30|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_30}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |page=179 |title=Ambitiosa mors: suicide and self in Roman thought and literature|first=Timothy |last=Hill|publisher= Routledge|year=2004 |isbn= 978-0-415-97097-6 |series=Studies in Classics Volume 10}}</ref> a man much admired at Rome. He had begun his history with some unknown date, certainly before the death of Cicero,<ref>{{cite book|author=Seneca the Elder|title=Suasoriae|chapter=6.18.23}}</ref> so probably the [[Roman civil wars|Civil Wars]] or the death of [[Julius Caesar]], ending with the reign of [[Tiberius]]. It was cut short when Bassus died slowly of a lingering disease, with such spirit and objectivity that Seneca remarked that Bassus seemed to treat it as someone else's dying.\n\nPliny's continuation of Bassus's ''History'' was one of the authorities followed by [[Lives of the Twelve Caesars|Suetonius]] and [[Plutarch]].<ref name=EB1911/> Tacitus also cites Pliny as a source. He is mentioned concerning the loyalty of [[Burrus]], commander of the [[Praetorian Guard]], whom [[Nero]] removed for disloyalty.<ref>{{cite book|author=Tacitus|title=The Annals|chapter=13.20|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0078&layout=&loc=13.20}}</ref> Tacitus portrays parts of Pliny's view of the [[Pisonian conspiracy]] to kill Nero and make Piso emperor as \"absurd\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Tacitus|title=The Annals|chapter=15.53|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0078&layout=&loc=15.53}}</ref> and mentions that he could not decide whether Pliny's account or that of [[Marcus Valerius Messala Corvinus (consul 58)|Messalla]] was more accurate concerning some of the details of the [[Year of the Four Emperors]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Tacitus |title=The Histories|chapter=3.29 |url=http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/tacitus/TacitusHistory03.html}}</ref> Evidently Pliny's extension of Bassus extended at least from the reign of Nero to that of Vespasian. Pliny seems to have known it was going to be controversial, as he deliberately reserved it for publication after his death:<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n<blockquote>\nIt has been long completed and its accuracy confirmed; but I have determined to commit the charge of it to my heirs, lest I should have been suspected, during my lifetime, of having been unduly influenced by ambition. By this means I confer an obligation on those who occupy the same ground with myself; and also on posterity, who, I am aware, will contend with me, as I have done with my predecessors.<ref>{{cite book | author=Pliny | title=Natural History | url=https://archive.org/details/naturalhistory08plinuoft | chapter=Preface, 20}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==''Natural History''==\n{{Main|Natural History (Pliny)}}\nPliny's last work, according to his nephew, was the ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]'' (literally \"Natural History\"), an [[encyclopedia]] into which he collected much of the knowledge of his time.<ref name=PYIII.5/> It comprised 37 books. His sources were personal experience, his own prior works (such as the work on [[Germania]]), and extracts from other works. These extracts were collected in the following manner: One servant would read aloud, and another would write the extract as dictated by Pliny. He is said to have dictated extracts while taking a bath. In winter, he furnished the copier with gloves and long sleeves so his writing hand would not stiffen with cold (Pliny the Younger in ''avunculus meus''). His extract collection finally reached about 160 volumes, which Larcius Licinius, the [[legatus|Praetorian legate]] of Hispania Tarraconensis, vainly offered to purchase for 400,000 ''sesterces.''<ref name=PYIII.5/><ref name=EB1911/> That would have been in 73/74 (see above). Pliny bequeathed the extracts to his nephew.\n\nWhen composition of the'' Natural History'' began is unknown. Since he was preoccupied with his other works under Nero and then had to finish the history of his times, he  is unlikely to have begun before 70. The procuratorships offered the ideal opportunity for an encyclopedic frame of mind. The date of an overall composition cannot be assigned to any one year. The dates of different parts must be determined, if they can, by [[Philology|philological]] analysis (the ''post mortem'' of the scholars).\n\n[[File:Laocoon Pio-Clementino Inv1059-1064-1067.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|''[[Laocoon and his Sons]]'', a sculpture admired by Pliny]]\n\nThe closest known event to a single publication date, that is, when the manuscript was probably released to the public for borrowing and copying, and was probably sent to the Flavians, is the date of the Dedication in the first of the 37 books. It is to the ''[[imperator]]'' Titus. As Titus and Vespasian had the same name, Titus Flavius Vespasianus, earlier writers hypothesized a dedication to Vespasian. Pliny's mention of a brother ([[Domitian]]) and joint offices with a father, calling that father \"great\", points certainly to Titus.<ref name=B7>Beagon (2005), p. 7.</ref>\n\nPliny also says that Titus had been [[Roman consul|consul]] six times. The first six consulships of Titus are in 70, 72, 74, 75, 76, and 77, all conjointly with Vespasian, and the seventh was in 79. This brings the date of the Dedication probably to 77. In that year, Vespasian was 68. He had been ruling conjointly with Titus for some years.<ref name=B7/> The title ''imperator'' does not indicate that Titus was sole emperor, but was awarded for a military victory, in this case that in Jerusalem in 70.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luc.edu/roman-emperors/titus.htm|title=Roman Emperors - DIR Titus|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAside from minor finishing touches, the work in 37 books was completed in AD 77.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The New Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|edition=15|year=1977|volume=14|page=572a}}</ref> That it was written entirely in 77 or that Pliny was finished with it then cannot be proved. Moreover, the dedication could have been written before publication, and it could have been published either privately or publicly earlier without the dedication. The only certain fact is that Pliny did no further work on it after AD 79.\n\nThe ''Naturalis Historia'' is one of the largest single works to have survived from the Roman Empire to the modern day and purports to cover the entire field of ancient knowledge, based on the best authorities available to Pliny. He claims to be the only Roman ever to have undertaken such a work. It encompasses the fields of [[botany]], [[zoology]], [[astronomy]], [[geology]], and [[mineralogy]], as well as the exploitation of those resources. It remains a standard work for the Roman period and the advances in technology and understanding of natural phenomena at the time. His discussions of some technical advances are the only sources for those inventions, such as [[hushing]] in mining technology or the use of [[water mill]]s for crushing or grinding corn. Much of what he wrote about has been confirmed by [[archaeology]]. It is virtually the only work which describes the work of artists of the time, and is a reference work for the [[history of art]]. As such, Pliny's approach to describing the work of artists was to inform [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] in writing his commentaries and [[Giorgio Vasari]] who wrote the celebrated ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects]]''.\n\nThe work became a model for all later encyclopedias in terms of the breadth of subject matter examined, the need to reference original authors, and a comprehensive index list of the contents. It is the only work by Pliny to have survived, and the last that he published, lacking a final revision at his sudden and unexpected death in the AD 79 eruption of Vesuvius.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Pompeii Garden of the Fugitives 02.jpg|thumb|right|Plaster casts of the casualties of the pumice fall, whose remains vanished, leaving cavities in the pumice at [[Pompeii]]]]\nPliny had received from Emperor Vespasian, who had died two months earlier, the appointment of ''[[praefectus]] classis'' ([[Roman navy#High Command|fleet commander]]) in the [[Roman Navy]]. He was stationed at [[Misenum]], at the time of the great [[volcanic eruption|eruption]] of [[Mount Vesuvius]],<ref name=EB1911/> which destroyed and  buried [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]]. He was preparing to cross the [[Bay of Naples]] to observe the phenomenon directly when a message  arrived from  his friend [[Rectina]] asking to rescue [[Pomponianus]] and her. Launching the galleys under his command to the evacuation of the opposite shore, he himself took \"a fast-sailing cutter\", a decision that may have cost him his life. His nephew, Pliny the Younger, provided an account of his death, obtained from the survivors. The nephew and his mother had decided not to go on the voyage across the bay.\n\nAs the light vessel approached the shore near Herculaneum, cinders and pumice began to fall on it. Pliny's helmsman advised turning back, to which Pliny replied, \"[[Fortune favours the brave]]; steer to where Pomponianus is.\" ([[Stabiae]], near the modern town of [[Castellammare di Stabia]].) They landed and found Pomponianus \"in the greatest consternation.\" Pliny hugged and comforted him. They could not find Rectina. They loaded the cutter, but the same winds that brought it to Stabiae prevented it from leaving. Pliny reassured his party by feasting, bathing, and sleeping while waiting for the wind to abate, but finally they had to leave the buildings for fear of collapse and try their luck in the pumice fall. Pliny sat down and could not get up even with assistance, and was left behind. His companions theorized that he collapsed and died through inhaling poisonous gases emitted from the volcano. On their return two days later after the plume had dispersed, his body was found under the pumice with no apparent external injuries. The problem with the toxicity theory is that his companions were unaffected by the same fumes, and they had no mobility problems, whereas Pliny had to sit and could not rise. As he is described as a corpulent man,<ref name=PYVI.16>{{cite book|author=Pliny the Younger|chapter=VI.16 To Tacitus|title=Letters|url=http://www.bartleby.com/9/4/1065.html}}</ref> who also suffered from [[asthma]],  his friends are thought to have left him because he was already dead.<ref name=littell>{{cite journal|title=Death of Pliny the Elder|first=Jacob, MD|last=Bigelow|page=123|journal=Littell's Living Age|editor-first=E.|editor-last=Littell|series=Third|volume=V|date=1859|location=Boston|publisher=Littell, Son, and Company}}</ref>\n\nThe story of his last hours is told in a letter addressed 27 years afterwards to Tacitus by  Pliny the Younger,<ref name=PYVI.16/><ref name=EB1911/> who also sent to another correspondent, [[Baebius Macer]], an account of his uncle's writings and his manner of life.<ref name=\"PYIII.5\"/><ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|last=Sands |first=John Edwin |wstitle=Pliny the Elder|volume=21 |pages=841\u2013844 |inline=1}}</ref> The fragment from Suetonius (see under \"External links\" below) states a somewhat less flattering view, that Pliny approached the shore only from scientific interest and then asked a slave to kill him to avoid heat from the volcano. It is not as credible a source, as it is clear from the nephew's letter that the persons Pliny came to rescue escaped to tell the tale in detail. Moreover, Suetonius hypothesizes that a party witnessing events so agonizing as to destroy Pliny or cause him to order his own death are suspect as they apparently were subject to none of these fatal events themselves.\n\nIn 1859, Jacob Bigelow, M.D., after summarizing the widespread misinformation about Pliny's death, examined the evidence and concluded that Pliny was overweight, in poor health, and died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. <ref>Bigelow, Jacob. (1859). ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/25057949|On the Death of Pliny the Elder]'', ''Memoirs of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences'' Vol. 6, No. 2 (1859), pp. 223-227.</ref> In 1967, science historian [[Conway Zirkle]] similarly stated that \"there is widespread and persisting misinformation\" about Pliny's death. He suggested that despite his rescue attempt, Pliny never came within miles of Vesuvius and no evidence has been found that shows he died from breathing in fumes, and like Bigelow, concluded that he died of a heart attack.<ref>Zirkle, Conway.
