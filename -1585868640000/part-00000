After a difficult childhood\u2014his father killed himself when Arthur was twelve years old\u2014Japin entered the [[Amsterdamse Toneelschool & Kleinkunstacademie|Kleinkunstacademie]] in [[Amsterdam]], where he trained as an actor. He was also briefly an [[opera singer]] at [[De Nederlandse Opera]] in Amsterdam.\n\nHis first novel, ''[[De zwarte met het witte hart]]'' (1997), translated as [[The Two Hearts of Kwasi Boachi]], was the story of two [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] princes, [[Kwame Poku]] and [[Kwasi Boachi]], who were taken from today's [[Ghana]] and taken to the court of the Dutch king [[William I of the Netherlands|Willem I]] in 1837. The book became a bestseller and is considered a classic of modern Dutch literature. In November 2007, an opera based on the novel premiered in [[Rotterdam]], with an English libretto by Arthur Japin and music by the British composer [[Jonathan Dove]].\n\nHis second book, ''[[De droom van de leeuw]]'' (2002), is a novelized version of his relationship with the Dutch actress and novelist [[Rosita Steenbeek]] in [[Rome]], where Steenbeek became the last lover of the Italian director [[Federico Fellini]]. His third novel, ''[[Een schitterend gebrek]]'', translated as ''[[In Lucia's Eyes]]'' (2003), was a return to the historical novel, about [[Casanova]]'s first lover, Lucia, who, he reports in his memoirs, inexplicably abandoned him in his youth, only to resurface years later as a hideous prostitute in an [[Amsterdam]] brothel.

Once [[Nazi]] Germany invaded the Netherlands his father was involved in the Dutch resistance movement, until he was captured and interned in a German concentration camp. After the war he became one of the few Indo advocates for an independent Indonesia. In his view the principle of liberty and independence applied to both situations: Dutch independence from Nazi Germany and Indonesian independence from the colonial Netherlands.<ref>Prins, Geert, Onno, \u2018Piekerans van een Popster\u2019 (Interview Moesson Magazine, edition 5, november 1999) [http://home.kpn.nl/paw1962/piekerans.htm]</ref>\n\nMuch of the literary work of the author Jansz is based on his Indo identity and his fathers' heritage.\n   \nIn 1997 Jansz married actress Jaloe Maat, the mother of his two youngest children. He has a (step)daughter from a previous marriage. He lives with his family in [[Deurne, Netherlands|Neerkant, the Netherlands]].\n\n==Music==\nTogether with [[Henny Vrienten]], Jansz wrote the majority of the Doe Maar-songs and alternated as lead vocalists. He was originally asked to be the band's keyboardist, and played synthesizer on many songs. His Indo background has influenced much of his work (for Doe Maar), particularly \"Rumah Saya\" (My House or My Home),<ref>{{YouTube|INBYkzgJQwY|Webpage with the song online}}.</ref> which he wrote and recorded in 1980 for ''Skunk'', one of the best-sold albums in Dutch pop history.<ref>The album 'Skunk' 1981.</ref> In the song he describes that he fits in with neither Dutch nor Indonesian culture fully.<ref>[http://home.hetnet.nl/~paw1962/citaten.htm]</ref>\n<blockquote>''No mountains at the horizon, in this land of my birth. [...] And then I long for the land of my father. But also there I will be a stranger. [...] Rumah saya dimana? (Wheres my home?)'' Song lyrics by Ernst Jansz, 1981.</blockquote>\n\nDoe Maar broke into superstardom in 1982, making both Jansz and Vrienten the perfect pop-idols in their mid-thirties. Overexposure caused them to break up two years later. Ernst Jansz returned to folk band [[CCC Inc]] and did other projects as a sideman and a solo-artist. In 1995 he rejoined singer-/songwriter [[Boudewijn de Groot]]'s backing band.\n\nIn 2000 Doe Maar released one last album and continued to play occasional reunion-shows.\n\n==Books and albums==\n[[File:TTF-2011.jpg|thumb|225px|left|[[Dutch Indies literature]] Professor Dr. Pamela Pattynama hosting literary talkshow with guest authors '''Ernst Jansz''' and [[Helga Ruebsamen]] at the 2011 [[Tong Tong Fair]] in the Hague.]]\nErnst Jansz has written three semi-autobiographical books: ''Gideons droom'' (Gideon's Dream, 1983) ''De Overkant'' (The Other Side, 1985), and ''Molenbeekstraat (Een liefdeslied 1948 \u2013 1970)'' (Molenbeekstraat: a lovesong 1948\u20131970), 2006).  The latter two share their titles with Jansz' solo-albums. ''Gideons droom'' is about a second-generation Indo (Indo-European) Dutchman like himself; ''De Overkant'' is a three-part book dealing with letters between Jansz and his family (especially his father), the life of his mother, and an account of his trip to Indonesia.

Once [[Nazi]] Germany invaded the Netherlands his father was involved in the Dutch resistance movement, until he was captured and interned in a German concentration camp. After the war he became one of the few Indo advocates for an independent Indonesia. In his view the principle of liberty and independence applied to both situations: Dutch independence from Nazi Germany and Indonesian independence from the colonial Netherlands.<ref>Prins, Geert, Onno, \u2018Piekerans van een Popster\u2019 (Interview Moesson Magazine, edition 5, november 1999) [http://home.kpn.nl/paw1962/piekerans.htm]</ref>\n\nMuch of the literary work of the author Jansz is based on his Indo identity and his fathers' heritage.\n   \nIn 1997 Jansz married actress Jaloe Maat, the mother of his two youngest children. He has a (step)daughter from a previous marriage. He lives with his family in [[Deurne, Netherlands|Neerkant, the Netherlands]].\n\n==Music==\nTogether with [[Henny Vrienten]], Jansz wrote the majority of the Doe Maar-songs and alternated as lead vocalists. He was originally asked to be the band's keyboardist, and played synthesizer on many songs. His Indo background has influenced much of his work (for Doe Maar), particularly \"Rumah Saya\" (My House or My Home),<ref>{{YouTube|INBYkzgJQwY|Webpage with the song online}}.</ref> which he wrote and recorded in 1980 for ''Skunk'', one of the best-sold albums in Dutch pop history.<ref>The album 'Skunk' 1981.</ref> In the song he describes that he fits in with neither Dutch nor Indonesian culture fully.<ref>[http://home.hetnet.nl/~paw1962/citaten.htm]</ref>\n<blockquote>''No mountains at the horizon, in this land of my birth. [...] And then I long for the land of my father. But also there I will be a stranger. [...] Rumah saya dimana? (Wheres my home?)'' Song lyrics by Ernst Jansz, 1981.</blockquote>\n\nDoe Maar broke into superstardom in 1982, making both Jansz and Vrienten the perfect pop-idols in their mid-thirties. Overexposure caused them to break up two years later. Ernst Jansz returned to folk band [[CCC Inc]] and did other projects as a sideman and a solo-artist. In 1995 he rejoined singer-/songwriter [[Boudewijn de Groot]]'s backing band.\n\nIn 2000 Doe Maar released one last album and continued to play occasional reunion-shows.\n\n==Books and albums==\n[[File:TTF-2011.jpg|thumb|225px|left|[[Dutch Indies literature]] Professor Dr. Pamela Pattynama hosting literary talkshow with guest authors '''Ernst Jansz''' and [[Helga Ruebsamen]] at the 2011 [[Tong Tong Fair]] in the Hague.]]\nErnst Jansz has written three semi-autobiographical books: ''Gideons droom'' (Gideon's Dream, 1983) ''De Overkant'' (The Other Side, 1985), and ''Molenbeekstraat (Een liefdeslied 1948 \u2013 1970)'' (Molenbeekstraat: a lovesong 1948\u20131970), 2006).  The latter two share their titles with Jansz' solo-albums. ''Gideons droom'' is about a second-generation Indo (Indo-European) Dutchman like himself; ''De Overkant'' is a three-part book dealing with letters between Jansz and his family (especially his father), the life of his mother, and an account of his trip to Indonesia.  ''Molenbeekstraat'' covers his early life and mixes in songtext from the ''Molenbeekstraat'' album.<ref>[http://www.ernstjansz.com/molenbeekstraat.htm]</ref>\n\n== Discography ==\n\n=== Soloalbums ===\n* 1999 \u2013 De Overkant\n* 2006 \u2013 Molenbeekstraat\n\n=== CCC inc. ===\n* 1970 \u2013 To Our Grandchildren\n* 1971 \u2013 Watching The Evening Sun\n* 1973 \u2013 Castle in Spain\n* 1975 \u2013 CCC Forever\n* 1984 \u2013 Van Beusekom\n* 1990 \u2013 Speed & Intensity\n* 2000 \u2013 Jan\n* 2007 \u2013 1967\u20132007 (Box)\n\n=== Slumberlandband ===\n* 1975 \u2013 Slumberlandband\n\n=== Doe Maar ===\n\n====Studioalbums====\n* 1979 \u2013 Doe Maar\n* 1981 \u2013 Skunk\n* 1982 \u2013 Doris Day & Andere Stukken\n* 1983 \u2013 4us\n* 2000 \u2013 Klaar\n\n====Dub-album====\n* 1982 \u2013 Doe de Dub (Dub-version of 'Doris Day')\n\n====Live-albums====\n* 1983 \u2013 Lijf aan Lijf\n* 1995 \u2013 Het Afscheidsconcert (incl. video)\n* 2000 \u2013 Hees van Ahoy (incl.

It then cuts to a radio interview with Emma Larsimon about the final chapter of her Lizzie Larck series shown from the radio of Caroline\u2019s house. Caroline, calling for her mother, walks into the kitchen to see her mother, Madame Daugeron, putting a knife in her mouth and taking out a tooth. Her mother then holds up the tooth and says it\u2019s \u201cfor Emma\u201d. The scene then cuts to Emma doing a reading of her latest book. At the reading she tells everyone that she is done writing Marianne. After the reading, moderated by her fiancee/boyfriend Pere, Emma spends the signing drinking, and then Caroline, who is shown to be a friend of Emma\u2019s from childhood, shows up. She tells Emma that her mother believes she is Marianne and that Emma must go to her. Emma denies that Marianne is real and Caroline then gives Emma the witch charm her mother gave her for Emma and shows Emma her stomach, on which her mother has carved on her in a strange language. Caroline is then escorted out by security saying she doesn\u2019t want to be next but she is. Emma, frightened, goes out with Camile and gets drunk, causing her to miss her dinner with Pere. Emma tells Camile that as a child she had nightmares about Marianne, which caused her to write about Marianne as it made the nightmares stop. Emma returns to her flat to find a note from Pere about her standing him up and being drunk. That night Emma once again has a nightmare about Marianne. In the morning she finds that Pere has left her. That morning at work Caroline shows up and hangs herself after telling Emma that her mother wants her to write more or that she\u2019ll take Emma\u2019s parents next, giving Emma her cross to return to her mother, and referencing an event when they were kids at the lighthouse. After being unable to reach her parents, Emma, with Camile, returns to Elden. On the way Emma describes Marianne to Camile, telling her that the one thing Marianne cannot lie about is her name, noting that she can evade the question but cannot lie about who she is. They stop once in Elden by the lighthouse and Emma hears Marianne calling her back and hears children singing a rhyme about Marianne. Then Father Xavier shows up with his dog and yells at Emma that she needs to leave as no one wants her there. They then stop at Madame Daugeron\u2019s, who seems disinterested in the death of her daughter. They have tea with Madame Daugeron, who acts insane and seems to know information about Emma that she shouldn\u2019t. As they flee Madame Daugeron, she screams that Emma must write or her parents will be next. They continue on her to parents house, where Emma finds a witch charm on the door. Once she enters she finds her parents having sex on the stairs. That night Camile wakes up and is attacked by Emma\u2019s father. Emma then runs out and finds Camile, then sees her parents running out into the woods naked with strange writing on them. She tries to follow but her father attacks her.\n |LineColor       = 000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |Title           = Tradition\n |AltTitle        = C'est coutume !\n |DirectedBy      = Samuel Bodin\n |WrittenBy       = Samuel Bodin<br />Quoc Dang Tran\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|9|13|df=yes}}\n |ShortSummary    = Synopsis: While a quirky police inspector digs into her parents\u2019 case, Emma drags Camille back to Caro\u2019s home and reconnects with the rest of her old crew.\nSummary: Camile tries to follow Emma, but stops to answer phone, which turns out to be the security company calling to check out the alarm. The operator directs Camile to lock the living room door; he\u2019s then shown to really be Marianne, who then attacks Camille. Emma returns to the house. The next day Inspector Ronan shows up to investigate her parents disappearance. Inspector Ronan discovers a witch charm hanging on the door. After saying that he cannot question Madame Daugeron because she\u2019s technically done nothing wrong, he agrees to interrogate her after Emma says she\u2019ll personalize her signature on his books. He advises Emma and Camile to stay home. Madame Daugeron is seen leaving her house and Emma and Camile then break in. Emma finds one of her books that has a strange language written throughout. There is one room in the house they cannot get into. While trying to investigate something tries to break out. Before they can do anything further Madame Daugeron returns. She has a knife and begins to cut her own arm off and tells Emma that she must write, after which they escape. Inspector Ronan visits a friend of his, Pat, who owns a shop dealing in mysticism. He shows him the witch charm, which causes Pat to recoil in fear. Pat tells him that it\u2019s dangerous witchcraft, which makes people vulnerable to spells. Inspector Ronan takes a necklace against demons, and Pat tells him that it won\u2019t help whoever had the charm, as they\u2019re cursed. Emma goes out by the sea to drink and sees her old friend Aurore, one of the Shipwreck punks. They catch up and Aurore leaves. Back at the house, Emma once again hears her father begging her to write, telling her if she doesn\u2019t Marianne will hurt them. Emma is shown beside the hole, where she hears the children singing the rhyme (Marianne, born on Tuesday, she was happy on Wednesday, got married on a Thursday, became a witch on a Friday, captured on a Saturday, judged on a Sunday, executed on Monday, buried on a Tuesday.) Madame Daugeron is then shown in the hole telling her she must write before Tuesday. Hugo, a boy in the neighborhood, finds a dead gull, then runs away when Madame Daugeron shows up and gets out of her car. She goes to the bird and spits in its eye. When Madame Daugeron gets back to her car Emma is in there. Madame Daugeron takes her to the funeral, where she spits in her daughter\u2019s eye as she lays in the casket. Emma runs out and is joined by the rest of the Shipwreck punks (Aurore, Seby, Tonio, and Arnaud (No-No)) by the abandoned boat. They get drunk and remember old times with Caroline (Caro). No-No sends Camile the article Emma wrote about her mother. Later that night Camile reads the article, which is extremely cruel to her mother, and asks Emma why she wrote it. Emma, angry that Camile read it after saying she wouldn\u2019t, lashes out. Emma hears all the voices telling her to write, and takes out her laptop and begins to write a new chapter, detailing how five cows were drowned at sea and five kids were hung. Emma\u2019s mother is then shown walking up out of the sea, naked.\n\n |LineColor       = 000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 3\n |Title           = Not an Easy Person\n |AltTitle        = Je ne suis pas un cadeau\n |DirectedBy      = Samuel Bodin\n |WrittenBy       = Samuel Bodin<br />Quoc Dang Tran\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|9|13|df=yes}}\n |ShortSummary    = Synopsis: Tonio makes a disturbing discovery at the shore. Another harrowing night with Emma pushes Camille to her limit. Marianne turns up the heat.\nSummary: As Tonio and No-No work, they find that their traps are empty and Tonio discovers that five cows have been drowned. Emma\u2019s mother returns and locks herself in the bathroom. When the police get there, she tells them that Emma broke her love for her. At Inspector Ronan\u2019s request, Emma leaves. She goes to the abandoned boat and gets drunk, after which Emma and Camile go to Seby\u2019s to eat. Seby introduces them to his pregnant wife, Sophie, and her son, Hugo. Emma continues to drink and tries to come onto Seby, who rebuffs her. Sophie then discovers that Hugo is missing. Seby, Camile, and Emma go looking for Hugo, and Emma directs them to go the lighthouse. There they find Hugo and four other kids hanging from the swingset. They are able to save all five children. When they get back to her parents house Camile tells Emma she\u2019s done, and leaves. Emma realizes that what she writes comes true. Once inside, Emma apologizes to her mom and her mom tells her that she wouldn\u2019t change a thing and they have plenty of time ahead of them. Emma goes to the church and steals holy water and a cross, then goes to Madame Daugeron\u2019s house and knocks her out. On her way home Camile pulls over to sleep, and upon waking realizes she\u2019s lost. Back at Madame Daugeron\u2019s, Emma is shown to be trying to exorcise Marianne. The holy water and the crucifix harm Madame Daugeron, who talks as Marianne, but does not exorcise her. Inspector Ronan calls and tells Emma he found her father and Emma flees, leaving Madame Daugeron tied up. Emma\u2019s father is in a coma in hospital after being found in an abandoned building, bowing before candles with the entire room strung with witch charms. Emma goes home to get her mom to bring her to visit her dad, and once she reaches her parents house she sees blood dripping down the front stairs. Inside she finds her mother stabbed to death. She then finds Madame Daugeron upstairs holding the knife and laughing. Emma strangles Madame Daugeron, seeming to kill her right as Camile returns and tries to stop her.

Seby comes to take her to her mother\u2019s funeral, after which the group all eats together. After a shower the word \u201cwrite\u201d appears in the fog on the mirror to Emma. Inspector Ronan shows up and tells her Madame Daugeron will only talk to her; she is no longer possessed but Marianne took her eyes, as \u201cshe never leaves empty handed\u201d.

Inspector Ronan breaks into the church and takes the book about the witch trials, the Molitor files, against Father Xavier\u2019s wishes.

However, things go terribly wrong as the baby is revealed to be a demon and during the delivery it kills Sophie. Emma then wakes up and gets the call that Seby really is having his baby. Once she gets to hospital she freaks out and tries to get in to stop things from happening. Before she can Seby comes out and tells them he has a son. Inspector Ronan reads the Molitor Report and finds that Marianne\u2019s last name is Basselin.

As she reaches her room Father Xavier realizes she has continued to write, and tells her it is finished. Emma pulls a gun on Father Xavier, asking why he beat her. He tells her he never touched her, and it\u2019s the effect of the holy water on her as she is now possessed by Marianne. Father Xavier tells her that since she yielded to her will, and as it\u2019s now Tuesday, Marianne is her.

It then cuts to a radio interview with Emma Larsimon about the final chapter of her Lizzie Larck series shown from the radio of Caroline\u2019s house. Caroline, calling for her mother, walks into the kitchen to see her mother, Madame Daugeron, putting a knife in her mouth and taking out a tooth. Her mother then holds up the tooth and says it\u2019s \u201cfor Emma\u201d. The scene then cuts to Emma doing a reading of her latest book. At the reading she tells everyone that she is done writing Marianne. After the reading, moderated by her fiancee/boyfriend Pere, Emma spends the signing drinking, and then Caroline, who is shown to be a friend of Emma\u2019s from childhood, shows up. She tells Emma that her mother believes she is Marianne and that Emma must go to her. Emma denies that Marianne is real and Caroline then gives Emma the witch charm her mother gave her for Emma and shows Emma her stomach, on which her mother has carved on her in a strange language. Caroline is then escorted out by security saying she doesn\u2019t want to be next but she is. Emma, frightened, goes out with Camile and gets drunk, causing her to miss her dinner with Pere. Emma tells Camile that as a child she had nightmares about Marianne, which caused her to write about Marianne as it made the nightmares stop. Emma returns to her flat to find a note from Pere about her standing him up and being drunk. That night Emma once again has a nightmare about Marianne. In the morning she finds that Pere has left her. That morning at work Caroline shows up and hangs herself after telling Emma that her mother wants her to write more or that she\u2019ll take Emma\u2019s parents next, giving Emma her cross to return to her mother, and referencing an event when they were kids at the lighthouse. After being unable to reach her parents, Emma, with Camile, returns to Elden. On the way Emma describes Marianne to Camile, telling her that the one thing Marianne cannot lie about is her name, noting that she can evade the question but cannot lie about who she is. They stop once in Elden by the lighthouse and Emma hears Marianne calling her back and hears children singing a rhyme about Marianne. Then Father Xavier shows up with his dog and yells at Emma that she needs to leave as no one wants her there. They then stop at Madame Daugeron\u2019s, who seems disinterested in the death of her daughter. They have tea with Madame Daugeron, who acts insane and seems to know information about Emma that she shouldn\u2019t. As they flee Madame Daugeron, she screams that Emma must write or her parents will be next. They continue on her to parents house, where Emma finds a witch charm on the door. Once she enters she finds her parents having sex on the stairs. That night Camile wakes up and is attacked by Emma\u2019s father. Emma then runs out and finds Camile, then sees her parents running out into the woods naked with strange writing on them. She tries to follow but her father attacks her.\n |LineColor       = 000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |Title           = Tradition\n |AltTitle        = C'est coutume !\n |DirectedBy      = Samuel Bodin\n |WrittenBy       = Samuel Bodin<br />Quoc Dang Tran\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|9|13|df=yes}}\n |ShortSummary    = Synopsis: While a quirky police inspector digs into her parents\u2019 case, Emma drags Camille back to Caro\u2019s home and reconnects with the rest of her old crew.\nSummary: Camile tries to follow Emma, but stops to answer phone, which turns out to be the security company calling to check out the alarm. The operator directs Camile to lock the living room door; he\u2019s then shown to really be Marianne, who then attacks Camille. Emma returns to the house. The next day Inspector Ronan shows up to investigate her parents disappearance. Inspector Ronan discovers a witch charm hanging on the door. After saying that he cannot question Madame Daugeron because she\u2019s technically done nothing wrong, he agrees to interrogate her after Emma says she\u2019ll personalize her signature on his books. He advises Emma and Camile to stay home. Madame Daugeron is seen leaving her house and Emma and Camile then break in. Emma finds one of her books that has a strange language written throughout. There is one room in the house they cannot get into. While trying to investigate something tries to break out. Before they can do anything further Madame Daugeron returns. She has a knife and begins to cut her own arm off and tells Emma that she must write, after which they escape. Inspector Ronan visits a friend of his, Pat, who owns a shop dealing in mysticism. He shows him the witch charm, which causes Pat to recoil in fear. Pat tells him that it\u2019s dangerous witchcraft, which makes people vulnerable to spells. Inspector Ronan takes a necklace against demons, and Pat tells him that it won\u2019t help whoever had the charm, as they\u2019re cursed. Emma goes out by the sea to drink and sees her old friend Aurore, one of the Shipwreck punks. They catch up and Aurore leaves. Back at the house, Emma once again hears her father begging her to write, telling her if she doesn\u2019t Marianne will hurt them. Emma is shown beside the hole, where she hears the children singing the rhyme (Marianne, born on Tuesday, she was happy on Wednesday, got married on a Thursday, became a witch on a Friday, captured on a Saturday, judged on a Sunday, executed on Monday, buried on a Tuesday.) Madame Daugeron is then shown in the hole telling her she must write before Tuesday. Hugo, a boy in the neighborhood, finds a dead gull, then runs away when Madame Daugeron shows up and gets out of her car. She goes to the bird and spits in its eye. When Madame Daugeron gets back to her car Emma is in there. Madame Daugeron takes her to the funeral, where she spits in her daughter\u2019s eye as she lays in the casket. Emma runs out and is joined by the rest of the Shipwreck punks (Aurore, Seby, Tonio, and Arnaud (No-No)) by the abandoned boat. They get drunk and remember old times with Caroline (Caro). No-No sends Camile the article Emma wrote about her mother. Later that night Camile reads the article, which is extremely cruel to her mother, and asks Emma why she wrote it. Emma, angry that Camile read it after saying she wouldn\u2019t, lashes out. Emma hears all the voices telling her to write, and takes out her laptop and begins to write a new chapter, detailing how five cows were drowned at sea and five kids were hung. Emma\u2019s mother is then shown walking up out of the sea, naked.\n\n |LineColor       = 000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 3\n |Title           = Not an Easy Person\n |AltTitle        = Je ne suis pas un cadeau\n |DirectedBy      = Samuel Bodin\n |WrittenBy       = Samuel Bodin<br />Quoc Dang Tran\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|9|13|df=yes}}\n |ShortSummary    = Synopsis: Tonio makes a disturbing discovery at the shore.

When they get back to her parents house Camile tells Emma she\u2019s done, and leaves. Emma realizes that what she writes comes true. Once inside, Emma apologizes to her mom and her mom tells her that she wouldn\u2019t change a thing and they have plenty of time ahead of them. Emma goes to the church and steals holy water and a cross, then goes to Madame Daugeron\u2019s house and knocks her out. On her way home Camile pulls over to sleep, and upon waking realizes she\u2019s lost. Back at Madame Daugeron\u2019s, Emma is shown to be trying to exorcise Marianne.
