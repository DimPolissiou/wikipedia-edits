As an example of this fact, see the following:\n\nIn the image to the right, a Gibbs random field over the provided graph has the form <math>\\Pr(A,B,C,D,E,F) \\propto f_1(A,B,D)f_2(A,C,D)f_3(C,D,F)f_4(C,E,F)</math>. If variables <math>C</math> and <math>D</math> are fixed, then the global Markov property requires that: <math>A, B \\perp E, F | C, D</math> (see [[conditional independence]]), since <math>C, D</math> forms a barrier between <math>A, B</math> and <math>E, F</math>.\n\nWith <math>C</math> and <math>D</math> constant, <math>\\Pr(A,B,E,F|C=c,D=d) \\propto [f_1(A,B,d)f_2(A,c,d)] \\cdot [f_3(c,d,F)f_4(c,E,F)] = g_1(A,B)g_2(E,F)</math> where <math>g_1(A,B) = f_1(A,B,d)f_2(A,c,d)</math> and <math>g_2(E,F) = f_3(c,d,F)f_4(c,E,F)</math>.

This limestone outcrop is surrounded by a horseshoe-shaped formation of younger [[Sandstone|sandstones]] ([[Gritstone|gritstones]]) and [[Shale|shales]]. Buxton is at the western edge of the limestone region. The layers of [[Carboniferous Limestone|carboniferous limestone]] were deposited in a warm shallow sea in the [[Vis\u00e9an|Brigantian]] stage of the [[Carboniferous]] period (around 330 million years ago). These deposits were compressed into rocks which over time were uplifted and folded into a dome. Erosion of the younger sandstones exposed the limestone [[Stratum|strata]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Leach|first=John|title=The Book of Buxton|publisher=Baracuda Books Limited|year=1987|isbn=0 86023 286 7|location=|pages=14-15, 83-91}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nLimestone has been quarried as building stone in the Buxton area for centuries.\n\nLime (also known as [[Calcium oxide|quicklime]]) is produced easily by heating limestone and it has been used for thousands of years. [[Lime mortar]] (a mix of lime, sand and water) has been used since ancient times for fixing together the stone blocks of buildings. Lime became used as a soil improver in agriculture since the late [[Middle Ages]]. Before electric lights, lime was burnt to light theatrical shows, putting the stage performers 'in the limelight'. Traditional round 'pudding pie' [[Lime kiln|lime kilns]] were built around Buxton to burn limestone that was layered with wood, coal or coke. The lime powder was drawn from the bottom of the kiln, after it had burnt for 3 to 5 days and then cooled for a further 2 days. The process generated huge quantities of burnt waste material, taking 3 tonnes of limestone and 3 tonnes of coal to make 1 tonne of lime powder.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Grin Low ===\n[[File:Remains_of_a_lime_kiln_at_Grin_Low.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Remains_of_a_lime_kiln_at_Grin_Low.jpg|thumb|Remains of a lime kiln at Grin Low]]\nGrin Low was the main location in Buxton for the early lime industry. It was an extensive area of limestone quarrying and was licensed for lime burning from 1662 by the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire|1st Duke Of Devonshire]]. Demand for lime grew dramatically during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. There are widespread remains of over 100 large lime kilns, built of earth and rock, which date from the 17th\u201319th centuries. The land is also covered in spoil heaps of waste material. Coal came from local collieries at [[Axe Edge Moor|Axe Edge]] and Goyts Moss. In 1820 the [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire|6th Duke of Devonshire]] commissioned the 'Grin Plantation' (now the wooded Buxton Country Park) to shield the scarred lime-burning landscape from visitors to the spa town of Buxton. In the 1850s lime production at Grin Low moved to a new large quarry on the south side of the hill (which was operated until its closure in 1952). In 1890 Grin Low produced 90,000 tonnes of lime.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MDR371&resourceID=1023|title=Grin Low Lime Kilns, Buxton (HER No.2896)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.heritagegateway.org.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nGrin Low Wood is a designated [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/PDFsForWeb/Citation/1001269.pdf|title=Poole\u2019s Cavern and Grin Low Wood|last=|first=|date=|website=Natural England|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nLime burning had also taken place at [[Dove Holes]] since 1650. The opening of the [[Cromford and High Peak Railway]] in 1831 generated expansion of quarrying around Buxton, with 4 new quarries: [[Harpur Hill Quarry]] in 1835, Perseverance in 1847, and Holderness and Bold Venture in 1857 at Dove Holes.\n\n=== Brunner Mond ===\n[[File:Miller's Dale - Monsal Trail view of Lime Kilns - geograph.org.uk - 945731.jpg|thumb|Victorian lime kilns on the Midland line to Buxton]]\nIn 1861 Belgian chemist [[Ernest Solvay]] developed the [[Solvay process]] (also called the ammonia-soda process) for the production of [[Sodium carbonate|soda ash]] (sodium carbonate) from salt brine and limestone.

This limestone outcrop is surrounded by a horseshoe-shaped formation of younger [[Sandstone|sandstones]] ([[Gritstone|gritstones]]) and [[Shale|shales]]. Buxton is at the western edge of the limestone region. The layers of [[Carboniferous Limestone|carboniferous limestone]] were deposited in a warm shallow sea in the [[Vis\u00e9an|Brigantian]] stage of the [[Carboniferous]] period (around 330 million years ago). These deposits were compressed into rocks which over time were uplifted and folded into a dome. Erosion of the younger sandstones exposed the limestone [[Stratum|strata]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Leach|first=John|title=The Book of Buxton|publisher=Baracuda Books Limited|year=1987|isbn=0 86023 286 7|location=|pages=14-15, 83-91}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nLimestone has been quarried as building stone in the Buxton area for centuries.\n\nLime (also known as [[Calcium oxide|quicklime]]) is produced easily by heating limestone and it has been used for thousands of years. [[Lime mortar]] (a mix of lime, sand and water) has been used since ancient times for fixing together the stone blocks of buildings. Lime became used as a soil improver in agriculture since the late [[Middle Ages]]. Before electric lights, lime was burnt to light theatrical shows, putting the stage performers 'in the limelight'. Traditional round 'pudding pie' [[Lime kiln|lime kilns]] were built around Buxton to burn limestone that was layered with wood, coal or coke. The lime powder was drawn from the bottom of the kiln, after it had burnt for 3 to 5 days and then cooled for a further 2 days. The process generated huge quantities of burnt waste material, taking 3 tonnes of limestone and 3 tonnes of coal to make 1 tonne of lime powder.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Grin Low ===\n[[File:Remains_of_a_lime_kiln_at_Grin_Low.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Remains_of_a_lime_kiln_at_Grin_Low.jpg|thumb|Remains of a lime kiln at Grin Low]]\nGrin Low was the main location in Buxton for the early lime industry. It was an extensive area of limestone quarrying and was licensed for lime burning from 1662 by the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire|1st Duke Of Devonshire]]. Demand for lime grew dramatically during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. There are widespread remains of over 100 large lime kilns, built of earth and rock, which date from the 17th\u201319th centuries. The land is also covered in spoil heaps of waste material. Coal came from local collieries at [[Axe Edge Moor|Axe Edge]] and Goyts Moss. In 1820 the [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire|6th Duke of Devonshire]] commisioned the 'Grin Plantation' (now the wooded Buxton Country Park) to shield the scarred lime-burning landscape from visitors to the spa town of Buxton. In the 1850s lime production at Grin Low moved to a new large quarry on the south side of the hill (which was operated until its closure in 1952). In 1890 Grin Low produced 90,000 tonnes of lime.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MDR371&resourceID=1023|title=Grin Low Lime Kilns, Buxton (HER No.2896)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.heritagegateway.org.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nGrin Low Wood is a designated [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/PDFsForWeb/Citation/1001269.pdf|title=Poole\u2019s Cavern and Grin Low Wood|last=|first=|date=|website=Natural England|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nLime burning had also taken place at [[Dove Holes]] since 1650. The opening of the [[Cromford and High Peak Railway]] in 1831 generated expansion of quarrying around Buxton, with 4 new quarries: [[Harpur Hill Quarry]] in 1835, Perseverance in 1847, and Holderness and Bold Venture in 1857 at Dove Holes.\n\n=== Brunner Mond ===\n[[File:Miller's Dale - Monsal Trail view of Lime Kilns - geograph.org.uk - 945731.jpg|thumb|Victorian lime kilns on the Midland line to Buxton]]\nIn 1861 Belgian chemist [[Ernest Solvay]] developed the [[Solvay process]] (also called the ammonia-soda process) for the production of [[Sodium carbonate|soda ash]] (sodium carbonate) from salt brine and limestone.

On site there are summer and winter camp sites, [[Game drive system|bison kill]] sites, [[tipi ring]]s, and artifacts such as pottery fragments, plant seeds, projectile points, egg shells and animal bones, all within a compact area.\n\nWanuskewin Heritage Park officially opened in June 1992; however scientific investigations in the area began in the early 1930s. Today, the [[University of Saskatchewan]] manages an archaeological research program at Wanuskewin with active archaeological digs. The Park was designated a Provincial Heritage Property in 1984, the only such site in [[Saskatchewan]] featuring prehistoric artifacts. It was named a National Historic Site in 1986. The following year Queen [[Elizabeth II]] unveiled a dedication plaque. In 2001, [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]], was named ''Pisimwa Kamiwohkitahpamikohk'', or, \u201cthe sun looks at him in a good way\u201d, by an elder in a ceremony at [[Saskatoon\u2014Wanuskewin|Wanuskewin]].\n\nWanuskewin's mission is to operate, on a sustainable basis, a Heritage Park under the leadership and guidance of First Nations people that contributes to increasing public awareness, understanding and appreciation of the cultural legacy of the [[Northern Plains]] First Nations people.\n\nDuring the peak summer season about 40\u201345 people are employed at the park. The place serves as:\n* a tourist attraction,\n* human resource development agency\n* scientific, cultural and educational authority\n* Gathering place for present day spiritual uses such a Sweats, Pipe Ceremonies and more\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.wanuskewin.com Wanuskewin Heritage Park]\n* [http://www.sicc.sk.ca/saskindian/a01fal03.htm Significance of Treaties Reaffirmed Through Historic Royal Visit (2001)]\n* [http://www.ammsa.com/sage/topnews-July-2003.html#anchor12833121 Award Winner Receives Royal Treatment (2003)]\n{{Saskatchewan parks}}\n{{NHSC}}\n\n{{coord|52|13|25|N|106|35|42|W|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Corman Park No. 344, Saskatchewan]]\n[[Category:National Historic Sites in Saskatchewan]]\n[[Category:First Nations museums in Canada]]\n[[Category:Museums in Saskatoon]]\n", "name_user": "Gmwikipedier", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanuskewin_Heritage_Park"}

After the success of ''Make It Big''  Michael had grown weary of continuing the group, and expressed to Ridgeley the desire that they should split up. A decision was made that the group would dissolve following the end of a tenure at [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley Stadiu]]<nowiki/>m for what was titled ''Wham: The Final''. Following the split, Michael began to work on songs that eventually would make his first solo album, which would be titled ''Faith''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Recording==\nMichael spent the greater part of 1987 writing and recording the songs for the ''Faith'' album. In addition to playing various instruments on the album, he wrote and produced every track on the recording except for one, \"[[Look at Your Hands]]\", which he co-wrote with David Austin. A contemporary \"[[Black music|black]]\" pop-R&B album, ''Faith'' showcases the vocals of Michael in a new style mode. Its songs are littered with introspective lyrics, which generated controversies about Michael's personal relationships at that time. Most of the material was recorded at Puk Recording Studios in Denmark and Sarm West Studios in London. The album covered many styles of which included [[soul music|soul]] (\"[[Father Figure (George Michael song)|Father Figure]]\", \"[[One More Try (George Michael song)|One More Try]]\"), [[Rock music|rock]] (\"Look at Your Hands\", \"[[Faith (George Michael song)|Faith]]\", \"[[Hand to Mouth (song)|Hand to Mouth]]\"), [[funk]] (\"[[Monkey (song)|Monkey]]\", \"[[Hard Day]]\") and [[jazz]] (\"[[Kissing a Fool (song)|Kissing a Fool]]\").\n\nSome of the material was more graphic than Michael's previous efforts with Wham! One such song was \"[[I Want Your Sex]]\", which had three parts: the first part was titled \"Rhythm 1: Lust\", which was the version that would eventually be released as a single and featured [[Electro music|electro funk]] influences; the second part was titled \"Rhythm 2: Brass in Love\", which mixed a more instrumentally-based funk live instrumentation with a smoother R&B arrangement during the verses; the third part, which was edited to be the final song on the album, was titled \"Rhythm 3: A Last Request\", featuring a jazz-influenced quiet storm and R&B sound combined with lyrics telling of Michael drunkenly trying to bring his lover to his bed.{{Quote box\n| width = 250px\n| align = right\n| quote = {{small|Michael's liner notes in the booklet:\n\n\"These songs are the result of the last two years of my life.

After this, the song featured a [[rockabilly]] sound similar to [[Bo Diddley]] while Michael added his own style with his vocals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/george-michael-faith/|title=George Michael: Faith|website=Pitchfork|language=en|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref> \"Father Figure\" originally was a dance-styled production until Michael removed the snare drums from it and kept it that way because he loved what he heard, making the song a mid-tempo R&B ballad. \"One More Try\" was a soul song in the tradition of songs by [[Marvin Gaye]] and [[Stevie Wonder]]; its lyrics tell of a man who pushes his lover away out of fear of repeating past relationships, only to accept the invitation in the end.\n\n\"Hard Day\", much like the first two parts of \"I Want Your Sex\", was inspired by funk. The social commentary song \"Hand to Mouth\" had a slight pop and [[Folk music|folk]] approach while a similar social commentary song, \"Look at Your Hands\", co-written by Michael and David Austin, produced a pop song with rock elements featuring a piano and saxophone. \"Monkey\" returns to the funk influences of some of the other songs. A remix of the song by [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] brings a [[new jack swing]] approach to the original. \"Kissing a Fool\" is a jazz-influenced ballad with lyrics solemnly describing a breakup.\n\n==Release==<!-- Automatically generated by DASHBot-->\n[[File:George Michael.jpeg|thumb|Michael during a [[The Faith Tour|Faith Tour]] concert in 1988.

In addition to playing various instruments on the album, Michael wrote and produced every track on the recording except for one, \"[[Look at Your Hands]]\", which he co-wrote with David Austin. A \"[[Black music|black]]\" inspired [[Pop music|pop]]-[[R&B]] album, ''Faith''<nowiki/>'s songs include introspective lyrics, which generated controversies about Michael's personal relationships at that time.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Kr0DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA54&lpg=PA54&dq=I+was+much+happier+when+faith+black+george+michael#v=onepage&q=I%20was%20much%20happier%20when%20faith%20black%20george%20michael&f=false|title=Jet \u2013 Google Books|date=26 September 1988|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=5 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nBy 1986, Michael had spent five years as the lead singer of the popular duo [[Wham!]] and had grown tired of accusations that the group, which featured his best friend [[Andrew Ridgeley]], was nothing more than a [[teenybopper]] group. After the success of ''[[Make It Big]]'', Michael had grown weary of continuing the duo, and expressed to Ridgeley the desire that they should split up which eventually happened. Following the split, Michael began to work on songs that would make his first solo album, which would be titled ''Faith''.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-01-14/entertainment/ca-36257_1_george-michael|title=George Michael's Got 'Faith' and Lots More|last1=GREIN|first1=PAUL|date=14 January 1988|website=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>\n\n''Faith'' peaked at number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].

He was also honoured with the [[Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award|MTV Video Vanguard Award]]. Often ranked as one of the best albums of the 1980s, ''Faith'' was ranked number 472 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''<nowiki/>'s list of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]].\n\n==Background==\nBy 1986, Michael had spent five years as the lead singer of the popular duo [[Wham!]] and had grown tired of accusations that the group, which featured his best friend [[Andrew Ridgeley]], was nothing more than a [[teenybopper]] group despite the serious subject matter that was included on albums such as ''[[Fantastic (Wham! album)|Fantastic]]'' and ''[[Make It Big]]''. After the success of ''Make It Big''  Michael had grown weary of continuing the group, and expressed to Ridgeley the desire that they should split up. A decision was made that the group would dissolve following the end of a tenure at [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley Stadiu]]<nowiki/>m for what was titled ''Wham: The Final''. Following the split, Michael began to work on songs that eventually would make his first solo album, which would be titled ''Faith''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Recording==\nMichael spent the greater part of 1987 writing and recording the songs for the ''Faith'' album. In addition to playing various instruments on the album, he wrote and produced every track on the recording except for one, \"[[Look at Your Hands]]\", which he co-wrote with David Austin. A contemporary \"[[Black music|black]]\" pop-R&B album, ''Faith'' showcases the vocals of Michael in a new style mode. Its songs are littered with introspective lyrics, which generated controversies about Michael's personal relationships at that time. Most of the material was recorded at Puk Recording Studios in Denmark and Sarm West Studios in London. The album covered many styles of which included [[soul music|soul]] (\"[[Father Figure (George Michael song)|Father Figure]]\", \"[[One More Try (George Michael song)|One More Try]]\"), [[Rock music|rock]] (\"Look at Your Hands\", \"[[Faith (George Michael song)|Faith]]\", \"[[Hand to Mouth (song)|Hand to Mouth]]\"), [[funk]] (\"[[Monkey (song)|Monkey]]\", \"[[Hard Day]]\") and [[jazz]] (\"[[Kissing a Fool (song)|Kissing a Fool]]\").\n\nSome of the material was more graphic than Michael's previous efforts with Wham! One such song was \"[[I Want Your Sex]]\", which had three parts: the first part was titled \"Rhythm 1: Lust\", which was the version that would eventually be released as a single and featured [[Electro music|electro funk]] influences; the second part was titled \"Rhythm 2: Brass in Love\", which mixed a more instrumentally-based funk live instrumentation with a smoother R&B arrangement during the verses; the third part, which was edited to be the final song on the album, was titled \"Rhythm 3: A Last Request\", featuring a jazz-influenced quiet storm and R&B sound combined with lyrics telling of Michael drunkenly trying to bring his lover to his bed.{{Quote box\n| width = 250px\n| align = right\n| quote = {{small|Michael's liner notes in the booklet:\n\n\"These songs are the result of the last two years of my life.

After this, the song featured a [[rockabilly]] sound similar to [[Bo Diddley]] while Michael added his own style with his vocals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/george-michael-faith/|title=George Michael: Faith|website=Pitchfork|language=en|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref> \"Father Figure\" originally was a dance-styled production until Michael removed the snare drums from it and kept it that way because he loved what he heard, making the song a mid-tempo R&B ballad. \"One More Try\" was a soul song in the tradition of songs by [[Marvin Gaye]] and [[Stevie Wonder]]; its lyrics tell of a man who pushes his lover away out of fear of repeating past relationships, only to accept the invitation in the end.\n\n\"Hard Day\", much like the first two parts of \"I Want Your Sex\", was inspired by funk. The social commentary song \"Hand to Mouth\" had a slight pop and [[Folk music|folk]] approach while a similar social commentary song, \"Look at Your Hands\", co-written by Michael and David Austin, produced a pop song with rock elements featuring a piano and saxophone. \"Monkey\" returns to the funk influences of some of the other songs. A remix of the song by [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] brings a [[new jack swing]] approach to the original. \"Kissing a Fool\" is a jazz-influenced ballad with lyrics solemnly describing a breakup.\n\n==Release==<!-- Automatically generated by DASHBot-->\n[[File:George Michael.jpeg|thumb|Michael during a [[The Faith Tour|Faith Tour]] concert in 1988.
