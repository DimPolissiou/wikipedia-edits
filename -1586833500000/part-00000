[[Applications of virtual reality]] can include entertainment (i.e. [[video game]]s) and educational purposes (i.e. medical or military training). Other, distinct types of VR style technology include [[augmented reality]] and [[mixed reality]].\n\nCurrently standard virtual reality systems use either [[virtual reality headset]]s or multi-projected environments to generate realistic images, sounds and other sensations that simulate a user's physical presence in a virtual environment. A person using virtual reality equipment is able to look around the artificial world, move around in it, and interact with virtual features or items. The effect is commonly created by VR headsets consisting of a [[head-mounted display]] with a small screen in front of the eyes, but can also be created through specially designed rooms with multiple large screens. Virtual reality typically incorporates [[Auditory feedback|auditory]] and [[video feedback]], but may also allow other types of sensory and force feedback through [[haptic technology]].\n\n==Etymology==\n\"[[Virtual (philosophy)|Virtual]]\" has had the meaning of \"being something in essence or effect, though not actually or in fact\" since the mid-1400s.<ref name=\"etymonline.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=virtual|title=Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref> The term \"virtual\" has been used in the computer sense of \"not [[Reality|physically existing]] but made to appear by [[software]]\" since 1959.<ref name=\"etymonline.com\" />\n\nIn 1938, French avant-garde playwright [[Antonin Artaud]] described the illusory nature of characters and objects in the [[theatre]] as [[:fr:R\u00e9alit\u00e9 virtuelle|\"la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 virtuelle\"]] in a collection of essays, ''Le Th\u00e9\u00e2tre et son double''. The English translation of this book, published in 1958 as ''[[The Theater and its Double]]'',<ref name=\"Artaud 1958\">[[Antonin Artaud]], ''The Theatre and its Double'' Trans. Mary Caroline Richards. (New York: Grove Weidenfeld, 1958).</ref> is the earliest published use of the term \"virtual reality\". The term \"[[artificial reality]]\", coined by [[Myron W. Krueger|Myron Krueger]], has been in use since the 1970s. The term \"virtual reality\" was first used in a science fiction context in ''The Judas Mandala'', a 1982 novel by [[Damien Broderick]].\n\n==Forms and methods==\n{{Further|Immersion (virtual reality)|Reality\u2013virtuality continuum}}\n\nOne method by which virtual reality can be realized is [[simulation]]-based virtual reality. Driving simulators, for example, give the driver on board the impression of actually driving an actual vehicle by predicting vehicular motion caused by driver input and feeding back corresponding visual, motion and audio cues to the driver.\n\nWith [[Avatar (virtual reality)|avatar image]]-based virtual reality, people can join the virtual environment in the form of real video as well as an avatar. One can participate in the [[3D computer graphics|3D]] distributed virtual environment as form of either a conventional avatar or a real video. A user can select own type of participation based on the system capability.\n\nIn projector-based virtual reality, modeling of the real environment plays a vital role in various virtual reality applications, such as robot navigation, construction modeling, and airplane simulation. Image-based virtual reality systems have been gaining popularity in [[computer graphics]] and [[computer vision]] communities. In generating realistic models, it is essential to accurately register acquired 3D data; usually, a camera is used for modeling small [[Object (image processing)|objects]] at a short distance.\n\nDesktop-based virtual reality involves displaying a 3D [[virtual world]] on a regular [[Visual display unit|desktop display]] without use of any specialized [[positional tracking]] equipment. Many modern [[First-person (gaming)|first-person]] video games can be used as an example, using various triggers, responsive characters, and other such interactive devices to make the user feel as though they are in a virtual world. A common criticism of this form of immersion is that there is no sense of [[peripheral vision]], limiting the user's ability to know what is happening around them.\n[[File:Treadmill_Omni.jpg|thumb|A Omni treadmill being used at a VR convention.]]\n[[File:Engineers train in virtual environment to prepare for real missions 150616-Z-YF431-084.jpg|thumb|A [[Missouri National Guard]]sman looks into a VR training [[head-mounted display]] at [[Fort Leonard Wood]] in 2015]]\n\nA [[head-mounted display]] (HMD) more fully immerses the user in a virtual world. A [[virtual reality headset]] typically \n\nincludes two small high resolution [[OLED]] or [[LCD]] monitors which provide separate images for each eye for [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] graphics rendering a 3D virtual world, a [[3D audio effect|binaural audio]] system, positional and rotational real-time [[Motion capture|head tracking]] for six degrees of movement. Options include [[Motion controller|motion controls]] with [[Haptic technology|haptic feedback]] for physically interacting within the virtual world in an intuitive way with little to no abstraction and an [[omnidirectional treadmill]] for more freedom of physical movement allowing the user to perform locomotive motion in any direction.\n\n[[Augmented reality]] (AR) is a type of virtual reality technology that blends what the user sees in their real surroundings with digital content generated by computer software. The additional software-generated images with the virtual scene typically enhance how the real surroundings look in some way. AR systems layer virtual information over a camera [[live feed]] into a headset or [[smartglasses]] or through a [[mobile device]] giving the user the ability to view three-dimensional images.\n\n[[Mixed reality]] (MR) is the merging of the real world and virtual worlds to produce new environments and visualizations where physical and digital objects co-exist and interact in real time.\n\nA [[cyberspace]] is a networked virtual reality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/cyberspace|title=the definition of cyberspace}}</ref>\n\n[[Simulated reality]] is a hypothetical virtual reality as truly immersive as the [[Real life|actual reality]], enabling an advanced [[lifelike experience]] or even [[Virternity|virtual eternity]]. It is most likely to be produced using a [[brain\u2013computer interface]] and [[quantum computer|quantum computing]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:View-Master with Reel.jpg|thumb|[[View-Master]], a stereoscopic visual simulator, was introduced in 1939|alt=]]\n\nThe exact origins of virtual reality are disputed, partly because of how difficult it has been to formulate a definition for the concept of an alternative existence.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.theverge.com/a/virtual-reality/intro | title=Seeing is Believing: The State of Virtual Reality | author=Matthew Schnipper | publisher= The Verge | access-date= 7 March 2017}}</ref> The development of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] in Renaissance Europe created convincing depictions of spaces that did not exist, in what has been referred to as the \"multiplying of artificial worlds\".<ref name=\"Baltru\u0161aitis 1977\">{{cite book |last1=Baltru\u0161aitis |first1=Jurgis |last2=Strachan |first2=W.J. |title=Anamorphic art |date=1977 |publisher=Harry N. Abrams |location=New York |isbn=9780810906624 |page=4}}</ref> Other elements of virtual reality appeared as early as the 1860s. Antonin Artaud took the view that illusion was not distinct from reality, advocating that spectators at a play should suspend disbelief and regard the drama on stage as reality.<ref name=\"Artaud 1958\" /> The first references to the more modern concept of virtual reality came from [[science fiction]].\n\n=== 20th century ===\n[[Morton Heilig]] wrote in the 1950s of an \"Experience Theatre\" that could encompass all the senses in an effective manner, thus drawing the viewer into the onscreen activity. He built a prototype of his vision dubbed the [[Sensorama]] in 1962, along with five short films to be displayed in it while engaging multiple senses (sight, sound, smell, and touch). Predating digital computing, the Sensorama was a [[Machine|mechanical device]]. Heilig also developed what he referred to as the \"Telesphere Mask\" (patented in 1960). The patent application described the device as \"a telescopic television apparatus for individual use...The spectator is given a complete sensation of reality, i.e. moving three dimensional images which may be in colour, with 100% peripheral vision, binaural sound, scents and air breezes.\"<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.techradar.com/news/wearables/forgotten-genius-the-man-who-made-a-working-vr-machine-in-1957-1318253/2 | title=Forgotten genius: the man who made a working VR machine in 1957 | author=Holly Brockwell | date=3 April 2016 | publisher=Tech Radar | access-date=7 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968, [[Ivan Sutherland]], with the help of his students including [[Bob Sproull]], created what was widely considered to be the first head-mounted display system for use in immersive simulation applications. It was primitive both in terms of [[user interface]] and visual realism, and the HMD to be worn by the user was so heavy that it had to be suspended from the ceiling. The graphics comprising the virtual environment were simple [[wire-frame model]] rooms. The formidable appearance of the device inspired its name, [[The Sword of Damocles (virtual reality)|The Sword of Damocles]].\n\n==== 1970\u20131990 ====\nThe virtual reality industry mainly provided VR devices for medical, flight simulation, automobile industry design, and military training purposes from 1970 to 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/Cyberia/VETopLevels/VR.History.html|title=National Center for Supercomputing Applications: History|publisher=The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821054144/http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/Cyberia/VETopLevels/VR.History.html|archivedate=21 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nDavid Em became the first artist to produce navigable virtual worlds at [[NASA]]'s [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL) from 1977 to 1984.<ref name=\"Creative Computing March 1982\">{{cite journal|last1=Nelson|first1=Ted|title=Report on Siggraph '81|journal=Creative Computing|date=March 1982}}</ref> The [[Aspen Movie Map]], a crude [[virtual tour]] in which users could wander the streets of [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]] in one of the three modes (summer, winter, and [[Polygon (computer graphics)|polygons]]), was created at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in 1978.\n\n[[File:Virtual Reality Headset Prototype.jpg|thumb|[[Ames Research Center|NASA Ames]]'s 1985 VIEW headset]]\n\nIn 1979, [[Eric Howlett]] developed the Large Expanse, Extra Perspective (LEEP) optical system. The combined system created a stereoscopic image with a field of view wide enough to create a convincing sense of space. The users of the system have been impressed by the sensation of depth ([[field of view]]) in the scene and the corresponding realism. The original LEEP system was redesigned for NASA's [[Ames Research Center]] in 1985 for their first virtual reality installation, the VIEW (Virtual Interactive Environment Workstation) by [[Scott Fisher (technologist)|Scott Fisher]].

[[Applications of virtual reality]] can include entertainment (i.e. [[video game]]s) and educational purposes (i.e. medical or military training). Other, distinct types of VR style technology include [[augmented reality]] and [[mixed reality]].\n\nCurrently standard virtual reality systems use either [[virtual reality headset]]s or multi-projected environments to generate realistic images, sounds and other sensations that simulate a user's physical presence in a virtual environment. A person using virtual reality equipment is able to look around the artificial world, move around in it, and interact with virtual features or items. The effect is commonly created by VR headsets consisting of a [[head-mounted display]] with a small screen in front of the eyes, but can also be created through specially designed rooms with multiple large screens. Virtual reality typically incorporates [[Auditory feedback|auditory]] and [[video feedback]], but may also allow other types of sensory and force feedback through [[haptic technology]].\n\n==Etymology==\n\"[[Virtual (philosophy)|Virtual]]\" has had the meaning of \"being something in essence or effect, though not actually or in fact\" since the mid-1400s.<ref name=\"etymonline.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=virtual|title=Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref> The term \"virtual\" has been used in the computer sense of \"not [[Reality|physically existing]] but made to appear by [[software]]\" since 1959.<ref name=\"etymonline.com\" />\n\nIn 1938, French avant-garde playwright [[Antonin Artaud]] described the illusory nature of characters and objects in the [[theatre]] as [[:fr:R\u00e9alit\u00e9 virtuelle|\"la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 virtuelle\"]] in a collection of essays, ''Le Th\u00e9\u00e2tre et son double''. The English translation of this book, published in 1958 as ''[[The Theater and its Double]]'',<ref name=\"Artaud 1958\">[[Antonin Artaud]], ''The Theatre and its Double'' Trans. Mary Caroline Richards. (New York: Grove Weidenfeld, 1958).</ref> is the earliest published use of the term \"virtual reality\". The term \"[[artificial reality]]\", coined by [[Myron W. Krueger|Myron Krueger]], has been in use since the 1970s. The term \"virtual reality\" was first used in a science fiction context in ''The Judas Mandala'', a 1982 novel by [[Damien Broderick]].\n\n==Forms and methods==\n{{Further|Immersion (virtual reality)|Reality\u2013virtuality continuum}}\n\nOne method by which virtual reality can be realized is [[simulation]]-based virtual reality. Driving simulators, for example, give the driver on board the impression of actually driving an actual vehicle by predicting vehicular motion caused by driver input and feeding back corresponding visual, motion and audio cues to the driver.\n\nWith [[Avatar (virtual reality)|avatar image]]-based virtual reality, people can join the virtual environment in the form of real video as well as an avatar. One can participate in the [[3D computer graphics|3D]] distributed virtual environment as form of either a conventional avatar or a real video. A user can select own type of participation based on the system capability.\n\nIn projector-based virtual reality, modeling of the real environment plays a vital role in various virtual reality applications, such as robot navigation, construction modeling, and airplane simulation. Image-based virtual reality systems have been gaining popularity in [[computer graphics]] and [[computer vision]] communities. In generating realistic models, it is essential to accurately register acquired 3D data; usually, a camera is used for modeling small [[Object (image processing)|objects]] at a short distance.\n\nDesktop-based virtual reality involves displaying a 3D [[virtual world]] on a regular [[Visual display unit|desktop display]] without use of any specialized [[positional tracking]] equipment. Many modern [[First-person (gaming)|first-person]] video games can be used as an example, using various triggers, responsive characters, and other such interactive devices to make the user feel as though they are in a virtual world. A common criticism of this form of immersion is that there is no sense of [[peripheral vision]], limiting the user's ability to know what is happening around them.\n\n[[File:Engineers train in virtual environment to prepare for real missions 150616-Z-YF431-084.jpg|thumb|A [[Missouri National Guard]]sman looks into a VR training [[head-mounted display]] at [[Fort Leonard Wood]] in 2015]]\n\nA [[head-mounted display]] (HMD) more fully immerses the user in a virtual world. A [[virtual reality headset]] typically includes two small high resolution [[OLED]] or [[LCD]] monitors which provide separate images for each eye for [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] graphics rendering a 3D virtual world, a [[3D audio effect|binaural audio]] system, positional and rotational real-time [[Motion capture|head tracking]] for six degrees of movement. Options include [[Motion controller|motion controls]] with [[Haptic technology|haptic feedback]] for physically interacting within the virtual world in an intuitive way with little to no abstraction and an [[omnidirectional treadmill]] for more freedom of physical movement allowing the user to perform locomotive motion in any direction.\n\n[[Augmented reality]] (AR) is a type of virtual reality technology that blends what the user sees in their real surroundings with digital content generated by computer software. The additional software-generated images with the virtual scene typically enhance how the real surroundings look in some way. AR systems layer virtual information over a camera [[live feed]] into a headset or [[smartglasses]] or through a [[mobile device]] giving the user the ability to view three-dimensional images.\n\n[[Mixed reality]] (MR) is the merging of the real world and virtual worlds to produce new environments and visualizations where physical and digital objects co-exist and interact in real time.\n\nA [[cyberspace]] is a networked virtual reality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/cyberspace|title=the definition of cyberspace}}</ref>\n\n[[Simulated reality]] is a hypothetical virtual reality as truly immersive as the [[Real life|actual reality]], enabling an advanced [[lifelike experience]] or even [[Virternity|virtual eternity]]. It is most likely to be produced using a [[brain\u2013computer interface]] and [[quantum computer|quantum computing]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:View-Master with Reel.jpg|thumb|[[View-Master]], a stereoscopic visual simulator, was introduced in 1939|alt=]]\n\nThe exact origins of virtual reality are disputed, partly because of how difficult it has been to formulate a definition for the concept of an alternative existence.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.theverge.com/a/virtual-reality/intro | title=Seeing is Believing: The State of Virtual Reality | author=Matthew Schnipper | publisher= The Verge | access-date= 7 March 2017}}</ref> The development of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] in Renaissance Europe created convincing depictions of spaces that did not exist, in what has been referred to as the \"multiplying of artificial worlds\".<ref name=\"Baltru\u0161aitis 1977\">{{cite book |last1=Baltru\u0161aitis |first1=Jurgis |last2=Strachan |first2=W.J. |title=Anamorphic art |date=1977 |publisher=Harry N.

Antonin Artaud took the view that illusion was not distinct from reality, advocating that spectators at a play should suspend disbelief and regard the drama on stage as reality.<ref name=\"Artaud 1958\" /> The first references to the more modern concept of virtual reality came from [[science fiction]].\n\n=== 20th century ===\n[[Morton Heilig]] wrote in the 1950s of an \"Experience Theatre\" that could encompass all the senses in an effective manner, thus drawing the viewer into the onscreen activity. He built a prototype of his vision dubbed the [[Sensorama]] in 1962, along with five short films to be displayed in it while engaging multiple senses (sight, sound, smell, and touch). Predating digital computing, the Sensorama was a [[Machine|mechanical device]]. Heilig also developed what he referred to as the \"Telesphere Mask\" (patented in 1960). The patent application described the device as \"a telescopic television apparatus for individual use...The spectator is given a complete sensation of reality, i.e. moving three dimensional images which may be in colour, with 100% peripheral vision, binaural sound, scents and air breezes.\"<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.techradar.com/news/wearables/forgotten-genius-the-man-who-made-a-working-vr-machine-in-1957-1318253/2 | title=Forgotten genius: the man who made a working VR machine in 1957 | author=Holly Brockwell | date=3 April 2016 | publisher=Tech Radar | access-date=7 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968, [[Ivan Sutherland]], with the help of his students including [[Bob Sproull]], created what was widely considered to be the first head-mounted display system for use in immersive simulation applications. It was primitive both in terms of [[user interface]] and visual realism, and the HMD to be worn by the user was so heavy that it had to be suspended from the ceiling. The graphics comprising the virtual environment were simple [[wire-frame model]] rooms. The formidable appearance of the device inspired its name, [[The Sword of Damocles (virtual reality)|The Sword of Damocles]].\n\n==== 1970\u20131990 ====\nThe virtual reality industry mainly provided VR devices for medical, flight simulation, automobile industry design, and military training purposes from 1970 to 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/Cyberia/VETopLevels/VR.History.html|title=National Center for Supercomputing Applications: History|publisher=The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821054144/http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/Cyberia/VETopLevels/VR.History.html|archivedate=21 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nDavid Em became the first artist to produce navigable virtual worlds at [[NASA]]'s [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL) from 1977 to 1984.<ref name=\"Creative Computing March 1982\">{{cite journal|last1=Nelson|first1=Ted|title=Report on Siggraph '81|journal=Creative Computing|date=March 1982}}</ref> The [[Aspen Movie Map]], a crude [[virtual tour]] in which users could wander the streets of [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]] in one of the three modes (summer, winter, and [[Polygon (computer graphics)|polygons]]), was created at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in 1978.\n\n[[File:Virtual Reality Headset Prototype.jpg|thumb|[[Ames Research Center|NASA Ames]]'s 1985 VIEW headset]]\n\nIn 1979, [[Eric Howlett]] developed the Large Expanse, Extra Perspective (LEEP) optical system. The combined system created a stereoscopic image with a field of view wide enough to create a convincing sense of space. The users of the system have been impressed by the sensation of depth ([[field of view]]) in the scene and the corresponding realism. The original LEEP system was redesigned for NASA's [[Ames Research Center]] in 1985 for their first virtual reality installation, the VIEW (Virtual Interactive Environment Workstation) by [[Scott Fisher (technologist)|Scott Fisher]]. The LEEP system provides the basis for most of the modern virtual reality headsets.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Wayne|title=\"Virtual Reality and Artificial Environments\", A Critical History of Computer Graphics and Animation|date=December 2005|chapter=Section 17}}</ref>\n\n[[File:VPL DataSuit 1.jpg|upright|thumb|left|A [[VPL Research]] DataSuit, a full-body outfit with sensors for measuring the movement of arms, legs, and trunk.

Lanier had founded the company [[VPL Research]] in 1985. VPL Research has developed several VR devices like the [[DataGlove]], the EyePhone, and the AudioSphere. VPL licensed the DataGlove technology to [[Mattel]], which used it to make the [[Power Glove]], an early affordable VR device.\n\n[[Atari]] founded a research lab for virtual reality in 1982, but the lab was closed after two years due to the Atari Shock ([[North American video game crash of 1983]]).

Well-known formats include head-mounted displays or the CAVE. In order to convey a spatial impression, two images are generated and displayed from different perspectives (stereo projection). There are different technologies available to bring the respective image to the right eye. A distinction is made between active (e.g. [[Active shutter 3D system|shutter glasses]]) and passive technologies (e.g. [[Polarizer|polarizing filters]] or [[Infitec]]).{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nSpecial input devices are required for interaction with the virtual world. These include the [[3d mouse|3D mouse]], the [[wired glove]], [[motion controller]]s, and [[Optical tracking instruments|optical tracking]] sensors. Controllers typically use optical tracking systems (primarily [[infrared camera]]<nowiki/>s) for location and navigation, so that the user can move freely without wiring. Some input devices provide the user with [[Haptic technology|force feedback]] to the hands or other parts of the body, so that the human being can orientate himself in the three-dimensional world through haptics and sensor technology as a further sensory sensation and carry out realistic simulations. This allows for the viewer to have a sense of direction in the artificial landscape. Additional haptic feedback can be obtained from [[omnidirectional treadmill]]s (with which walking in virtual space is controlled by real walking movements) and vibration gloves and suits.\n\nVirtual reality cameras can be used to create [[VR photography]] using [[360-degree video|360-degree panorama videos]]. 360-degree camera shots can be mixed with virtual elements to merge reality and fiction through special effects.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} VR cameras are available in various formats, with varying numbers of lenses installed in the camera.\n\n== Applications ==\n{{Main|Applications of virtual reality}}\n\n[[File:Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin and Erisa Hines speak to members of the news media during a preview of the new Destination Mars (29712147171).jpg|thumb|[[Apollo 11]] astronaut [[Buzz Aldrin]] previewing the ''Destination: Mars'' VR experience at the [[Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex]] in 2016]]\n\nVirtual reality is most commonly used in entertainment applications such as video games and [[3D cinema]].
