At an early age, he showed unusual ability as a painter and sketcher. Another childhood passion was cinema; his interest in filmmaking was abetted by his parents' giving him an 8&nbsp;mm camera, which he used to produce home-made movies with his friends.\n \nAt the age of eight, he made his first trip to Spain. In Madrid, he sang for the first time in public with the Hotel Aveneda orchestra, interpreting the song \"Las hojas muertas\" (\"The Dead Leaves\"). At age 9 he watched ''[[On the Waterfront]]'', a movie that had a powerful influence on him and inspired him to write his first poems in English. Another cinematic influence at that age was the movie ''[[Niagara (1953 film)|Niagara]]'', where he discovered the eroticism and sensuality of [[Marilyn Monroe]].\n\n===Return to Spain===\nIn 1954, after a short stay in [[Barcelona]], Aute returned definitively to [[Madrid]], where he studied at the [[Colegio Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de las Maravillas]]. At 15, with his new guitar received as a birthday present, he performed at an end of school party, as part of a trio with two friends. Although he enjoyed music, art remained his primary passion. During these early years he was strongly influenced by [[German Expressionism]] and dedicated most of his time to painting, winning a silver medal in a Spanish Juvenile Art Contest.\n\n====1960s and 1970s====\nAute initially planned to be an architect but left school almost immediately to pursue a variety of career paths\u2014music, art, and film. He also wrote screenplays and several short stories (science fiction). Aute spent more than a year in France, working mainly in film. One of his first jobs was working as a translator and second assistant for the film ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]''.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Music===\nWhen he returned to Spain, he began writing songs for other artists like [[Massiel]] (''[[Rosas en el mar]]''). His song \"Aleluya #1\" became a huge hit in the United States when recorded in the United States by [[Ed Ames]] as \"[[Who Will Answer]]\". Although his friends and colleagues encouraged him to record his own songs, Aute initially refused, saying he didn't enjoy performing publicly.\n \nEventually, he pushed past his shyness and began a successful career with singles like \"Don Ram\u00f3n\" and \"Made in Spain\". His first album was ''Di\u00e1logos de Rodrigo y Ximena'' in 1968. By the 1970s, he was creating soundtracks for films directed by [[Jaime Ch\u00e1varri]], [[Luis Garc\u00eda Berlanga]], [[Fernando Fern\u00e1n-G\u00f3mez]], [[Fernando M\u00e9ndez]], and others.\n \nIn 1977, Aute performed in his first large public concert in Spain. Invited by the Cuban government to participate in the [[World Festival of Youth and Students|World Festival of Youth]] in Havana, Aute contracted tuberculosis and spent five months in Cuba recovering. This enforced downtime cemented his friendship with a Cuban musician, [[Silvio Rodr\u00edguez]], whom he later shared a concert stage with. That concert, [[Mano a Mano (Silvio Rodr\u00edguez and Luis Eduardo Aute album)|Mano a Mano]], became the basis of an international best-selling album.\n\n===Art===\nAute had his first individual exhibit in the gallery Alcon de Madrid in 1960. He was just sixteen. Two years later, he had his second exhibit in Madrid's Gallery Quixote. By 1964, his work was being sold in the United States at the Juarez Gallery in [[Palm Beach, Florida]].\n \nIn 1966, he was selected to participate in the Nona Biennial de S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil, where he brought three large pieces. During a brief break with music, he designed album covers that have become collectibles. In 1974, Aute won first prize for painting in the XXVIII Mostra Michetti in Italy. His work was featured in galleries and museums all over Europe.\n\n===Film===\nAute's interest in film showed up early in his life. In 1961, he created ''Senses'', a short film. In 1970, he wrote and directed another short film, ''Minutos despu\u00e9s'', which was selected for the II [[festival de Cine de Autor de Benalm\u00e1dena]]. In 1974 he wrote and directed ''A flor de piel'', his last short film for over ten years.\n\n===Poetry===\nAlthough he'd written poetry in both English and Spanish as a youth, Aute made a big splash in 1970 when he published a poem and drawing in Poesia 70 that managed to get the magazine shut down in conservative, Franco-controlled Spain. In 1975, he published''La matem\u00e1tica del espejo'' and followed it up a year later with \"Songs and Poems.\" In 1978, he published ''La liturgia del desorden''.\n\n====1980 and 1990s====\n=====Music=====\nIn 1980, Aute began a long musical association with [[Luis Mendo]], who arranged many of his songs. In 1983, Aute performed in a concert, \"Entre Amigos\", with [[Silvio Rodr\u00edguez]], [[Pablo Milan\u00e9s]], [[Teddy Bautista]], and [[Joan Manuel Serrat]]. The concert, held in the [[Teatro Salamanca]] in Madrid, was recorded live.\n \nThe prize-winning album resulting from the concert was a huge hit in both Spain and Latin America. In 1984, he released \"Cuerpo a cuerpo\", the first time he combined his music and art thematically. In 1992, \"[[Slowly]]\" climbed the charts and was followed one year later by ''[[Mano a Mano (Silvio Rodr\u00edguez and Luis Eduardo Aute album)|Mano a Mano]]'' with [[Silvio Rodriguez]].\n\n=====Art=====\nIn the 1980s, Aute's work was exhibited in galleries and shows all over Europe. In 1987, he combined an album, \"Templo\", with an art exhibit. He followed this pattern with a successful tour of Latin America and Spain with an exhibit called ''Ad Libidum'' in the mid 1990s.\n\n=====Film=====\nIn 1986, Aute wrote and directed ''El muro de las lamentaciones''; it was followed by ''La pupila del \u00e9xtasis'', several years later.\n\n=====Poetry=====\nIn 1980, he put out a revised edition of ''Songs and Poems''. Six years later, he released \"Templo de carne\". Along the way, he developed a type of poetry he calls \"poemigas\", short poems that often feature plays on words. He also developed a series called ''Animal'', which combined poetry, art, and music.\n\n====2000 to 2020====\n=====Music=====\nIn 2000, a number of Aute's peers produced a tribute album called \"Mira que eres canalla, Aute\" as a tribute to him. Fifteen years later, another generation of musicians released a second tribute, Giraluna. Aute continued his successful practice of combining music and art, adding poetry and film to the mix as well.\n \nIn 2001, he was awarded the Premio Luigi Tenco for his body of work. In 2003, he released ''Alas and Balas'', his first album in four years and \"Auterretratos,\" a collection of his work that was completed later with \"Auterretratos Volumes Two and Three.\" In 2012, he released ''El ni\u00f1o que miraba el mar'', an animated film, scored by Aute himself, that also featured his own drawings.\n \nIn 2015, Aute released ''Canciones de Amor y Destrucci\u00f3n'', an album he combined with 3D art work and toured with Giraluna, a concert featuring a short film animated and produced by Aute.\n\n=====Art=====\nThe 21st century brought a new twist to his work with a film called ''Un perro llamado Dolor''. Aute created over 4,000 drawings to animate the film. He also toured with an exhibit called \"Transfiguraciones\" that had venues in Cuba, Spain, Colombia, Ecuador, and Italy between 2004 and 2010. This was followed by a retrospective of his work in Zaragoza. Rarely has a year gone by since his first exhibit in 1960 without an Aute show somewhere in the world.\n\n=====Film=====\nIn 2001, Aute released ''Un perro llamado Dolor'', an animated film that he wrote, directed, and scored. The firm was featured in the film festivals of San Sebastian, Valladolid, Havana, and Tribeca (in the United States) as well as other venues. This successful format was followed by ''El ni\u00f1o y el basilisco'' and ''Giraluna''.\n\n=====Poetry=====\nIn 2002, Aute released \"Volver al agua,\" a compilation of his work. This was followed by \"What Things Are\" in 2005. He has continued throughout his career to combine poetry with other art forms.\n\n==Discography==\n*''Di\u00e1logos de Rodrigo y Gimena'' (RCA-Victor, 1968)\n*''24 Canciones Breves (1967-68)'' (RCA-Victor, 1968)\n*''\u00c1lbum 1966-67'' (1972)\n*''Rito'' (Ariola, 1973)\n*''Espuma'' (Ariola, 1974)\n*''Babel'' (Ariola, 1975)\n*''Sarc\u00f3fago'' (Ariola, 1976)\n*''Forgesound'' (Ariola, 1977)\n*''Albanta'' (Ariola, 1978)\n*''De Par en Par'' (Ariola, 1979)\n*''Alma'' (Movieplay, 1980)\n*''Fuga'' (Movieplay, 1981)\n*''Entre Amigos'' (Movieplay, 1983)\n*''Cuerpo a Cuerpo'' (Ariola, 1984)\n*''Nudo'' (Ariola, 1985)\n*''20 Canciones de Amor y un Poema Desesperado'' (Ariola, 1986)\n*''Templo'' (Ariola, 1987)\n*''Segundos Fuera'' (Ariola, 1989)\n*''Ufff!''

At an early age, he showed unusual ability as a painter and sketcher. Another childhood passion was cinema; his interest in filmmaking was abetted by his parents' giving him an 8&nbsp;mm camera, which he used to produce home-made movies with his friends.\n \nAt the age of eight, he made his first trip to Spain. In Madrid, he sang for the first time in public with the Hotel Aveneda orchestra, interpreting the song \"Las hojas muertas\" (\"The Dead Leaves\"). At age 9 he watched ''[[On the Waterfront]]'', a movie that had a powerful influence on him and inspired him to write his first poems in English. Another cinematic influence at that age was the movie ''[[Niagara (1953 film)|Niagara]]'', where he discovered the eroticism and sensuality of [[Marilyn Monroe]].\n\n===Return to Spain===\nIn 1954, after a short stay in [[Barcelona]], Aute returned definitively to [[Madrid]], where he studied at the [[Colegio Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de las Maravillas]]. At 15, with his new guitar received as a birthday present, he performed at an end of school party, as part of a trio with two friends. Although he enjoyed music, art remained his primary passion. During these early years he was strongly influenced by [[German Expressionism]] and dedicated most of his time to painting, winning a silver medal in a Spanish Juvenile Art Contest.\n\n====1960s and 1970s====\nAute initially planned to be an architect but left school almost immediately to pursue a variety of career paths\u2014music, art, and film. He also wrote screenplays and several short stories (science fiction). Aute spent more than a year in France, working mainly in film. One of his first jobs was working as a translator and second assistant for the film ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]''.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Music===\nWhen he returned to Spain, he began writing songs for other artists like [[Massiel]] (''[[Rosas en el mar]]''). His song \"Aleluya #1\" became a huge hit in the United States when recorded in the United States by [[Ed Ames]] as \"[[Who Will Answer]]\". Although his friends and colleagues encouraged him to record his own songs, Aute initially refused, saying he didn't enjoy performing publicly.\n \nEventually, he pushed past his shyness and began a successful career with singles like \"Don Ram\u00f3n\" and \"Made in Spain\". His first album was ''Di\u00e1logos de Rodrigo y Ximena'' in 1968. By the 1970s, he was creating soundtracks for films directed by [[Jaime Ch\u00e1varri]], [[Luis Garc\u00eda Berlanga]], [[Fernando Fern\u00e1n-G\u00f3mez]], [[Fernando M\u00e9ndez]], and others.\n \nIn 1977, Aute performed in his first large public concert in Spain. Invited by the Cuban government to participate in the [[World Festival of Youth and Students|World Festival of Youth]] in Havana, Aute contracted tuberculosis and spent five months in Cuba recovering. This enforced downtime cemented his friendship with a Cuban musician, [[Silvio Rodr\u00edguez]], whom he later shared a concert stage with. That concert, [[Mano a Mano (Silvio Rodr\u00edguez and Luis Eduardo Aute album)|Mano a Mano]], became the basis of an international best-selling album.\n\n===Art===\nAute had his first individual exhibit in the gallery Alcon de Madrid in 1960. He was just sixteen. Two years later, he had his second exhibit in Madrid's Gallery Quixote. By 1964, his work was being sold in the United States at the Juarez Gallery in [[Palm Beach, Florida]].\n \nIn 1966, he was selected to participate in the Nona Biennial de S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil, where he brought three large pieces. During a brief break with music, he designed album covers that have become collectibles. In 1974, Aute won first prize for painting in the XXVIII Mostra Michetti in Italy. His work was featured in galleries and museums all over Europe.\n\n===Film===\nAute's interest in film showed up early in his life. In 1961, he created ''Senses'', a short film. In 1970, he wrote and directed another short film, ''Minutos despu\u00e9s'', which was selected for the II [[festival de Cine de Autor de Benalm\u00e1dena]]. In 1974 he wrote and directed ''A flor de piel'', his last short film for over ten years.\n\n===Poetry===\nAlthough he'd written poetry in both English and Spanish as a youth, Aute made a big splash in 1970 when he published a poem and drawing in Poesia 70 that managed to get the magazine shut down in conservative, Franco-controlled Spain. In 1975, he published \"Mathematics of the Mirror\" and followed it up a year later with \"Songs and Poems.\" In 1978, he published ''Liturgy of Disorder''.\n\n====1980 and 1990s====\n=====Music=====\nIn 1980, Aute began a long musical association with Luis Mendo, who arranged many of his songs. In 1983, Aute performed in a concert, \"Entre Amigos\", with [[Silvio Rodr\u00edguez]], [[Pablo Milan\u00e9s]], Teddy Bautista, and [[Joan Manuel Serrat]]. The concert, held in the Salamanca Theater in Madrid, was recorded live.\n \nThe prize-winning album resulting from the concert was a huge hit in both Spain and Latin America. In 1984, he released \"Cuerpo a cuerpo\", the first time he combined his music and art thematically. In 1992, \"Slowly\" climbed the charts and was followed one year later by ''[[Mano a Mano (Silvio Rodr\u00edguez and Luis Eduardo Aute album)|Mano a Mano]]'' with [[Silvio Rodriguez]].\n\n=====Art=====\nIn the 1980s, Aute's work was exhibited in galleries and shows all over Europe. In 1987, he combined an album, \"Templo\", with an art exhibit. He followed this pattern with a successful tour of Latin America and Spain with an exhibit called ''Ad Libidum'' in the mid 1990s.\n\n=====Film=====\nIn 1986, Aute wrote and directed ''El muro de las lamentaciones''; it was followed by ''La pupila del extasis'', several years later.\n\n=====Poetry=====\nIn 1980, he put out a revised edition of ''Songs and Poems''. Six years later, he released \"Temple of flesh\". Along the way, he developed a type of poetry he calls \"poemigas\", short poems that often feature plays on words. He also developed a series called ''Animal'', which combined poetry, art, and music.\n\n====2000 to 2020====\n=====Music=====\nIn 2000, a number of Aute's peers produced a tribute album called \"Mira que eres canalla, Aute\" as a tribute to him. Fifteen years later, another generation of musicians released a second tribute, Giraluna. Aute has continued his successful practice of combining music and art, adding poetry and film to the mix as well.\n \nIn 2001, he was awarded the Premio Luigi Tenco for his body of work. In 2003, he released ''Alas and Balas'', his first album in four years and \"Auterretratos,\" a collection of his work that was completed later with \"Auterretratos Volumes Two and Three.\" In 2012, he released ''El nino que miraba el mar'', an animated film, scored by Aute himself, that also featured his own drawings.\n \nIn 2015, Aute released Canciones de Amor y Destruccion, an album he combined with 3D art work and toured with Giraluna, a concert featuring a short film animated and produced by Aute.\n\n=====Art=====\nThe 21st century brought a new twist to his work with a film called \"A Dog Called Pain.\" Aute created over 4,000 drawings to animate the film. He also toured with an exhibit called \"Transfigurations\" that had venues in Cuba, Spain, Colombia, Ecuador, and Italy between 2004 and 2010. This was followed by a retrospective of his work in Zaragosa. Rarely has a year gone by since his first exhibit in 1960 without an Aute show somewhere in the world.\n\n=====Film=====\nIn 2001, Aute released \"A Dog Called Pain,\" an animated film that he wrote, directed, and scored. The firm was featured in the film festivals of San Sebastian, Valladolid, Havana, and Tribeca (in the United States) as well as other venues. This successful format was followed by \"El nino y el basilisco\" and \"Giraluna.\"\n\n=====Poetry=====\nIn 2002, Aute released \"Volver al agua,\" a compilation of his work. This was followed by \"What Things Are\" in 2005. He has continued throughout his career to combine poetry with other art forms.\n\n==Discography==\n*''Di\u00e1logos de Rodrigo y Gimena'' (RCA-Victor, 1968)\n*''24 Canciones Breves (1967-68)'' (RCA-Victor, 1968)\n*''\u00c1lbum 1966-67'' (1972)\n*''Rito'' (Ariola, 1973)\n*''Espuma'' (Ariola, 1974)\n*''Babel'' (Ariola, 1975)\n*''Sarc\u00f3fago'' (Ariola, 1976)\n*''Forgesound'' (Ariola, 1977)\n*''Albanta'' (Ariola, 1978)\n*''De Par en Par'' (Ariola, 1979)\n*''Alma'' (Movieplay, 1980)\n*''Fuga'' (Movieplay, 1981)\n*''Entre Amigos'' (Movieplay, 1983)\n*''Cuerpo a Cuerpo'' (Ariola, 1984)\n*''Nudo'' (Ariola, 1985)\n*''20 Canciones de Amor y un Poema Desesperado'' (Ariola, 1986)\n*''Templo'' (Ariola, 1987)\n*''Segundos Fuera'' (Ariola, 1989)\n*''Ufff!''

Headline editors at the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' sports department immediately began shortening the name to \"White Sox\", and the team officially adopted the shorter name in {{MLBy|1904}}. The name change to the White Sox was brought on after scorekeeper Christoph Hynes wrote White Sox at the top of a scorecard rather than White Stockings, this scorecard was then seen by the press. The White Sox would continue to be built on pitching and defense in the following years, led by pitching workhorse [[Ed Walsh]], who routinely pitched over 400 innings each season in his prime.\n\n===1906: The Hitless Wonders===\n[[File:Ed Walsh portrait 1911.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Ed Walsh]] was a dominant starter for the White Sox from 1904 to 1916 and holds the lowest career ERA in Major League history.]]\nWalsh, [[Doc White]] and [[Nick Altrock]] paced the [[1906 Chicago White Sox season|White Sox]] to their {{MLBy|1906}} pennant and faced the crosstown rival [[1906 Chicago Cubs season|Cubs]] in the [[1906 World Series]]. The Cubs had won a then-record 116 regular-season games and were an overwhelming favorite to defeat the White Sox, especially since the White Sox had the lowest team batting average in the American League that year. However, in a stunning upset, the White Sox took the Series, and intracity bragging rights, in six games. To this day, the 1906 White Sox are known as \"the Hitless Wonders.\"\n\nThe White Sox spent the next decade alternating between solid and mediocre seasons. During this time, however, they acquired a solid core of players such as catcher [[Ray Schalk]], shortstop / third baseman [[Buck Weaver]], and pitchers [[Eddie Cicotte]], [[Red Faber]] and [[Reb Russell]].\n\nApril 18, 1907, was the coldest [[Opening Day]] ever, when the temperature was {{convert|38|F-change|0}}.<ref name=\"Chicago Tribune\">{{cite news|title=Heading for White Sox opener?

Weaver was moved over to third base.\n\nThe White Sox roared through the American League in 1917 with a record of 100\u201354\u2014still a franchise record for wins and winning percentage\u2014and won the pennant by nine games over the [[1917 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]]. Their offense, led by Collins (.289, 91 runs), Felsch (.308, 102 RBI) and Jackson (.301, 91 runs), was 1st in runs scored. The White Sox pitching staff, led by [[Eddie Cicotte]] (28\u201312 1.53 ERA), Williams (17\u20138 2.97 ERA), [[Red Faber]] (16\u201313 1.92 ERA) and [[Reb Russell]] (15\u20135 1.95 ERA), ranked first with a 2.16 ERA.\n\n====1917 World Series====\n{{main|1917 World Series}}\n\nThe White Sox faced the 98\u201356 [[1917 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] in the [[1917 World Series]]. The White Sox won Game one in Chicago 2\u20131 behind a complete game by Cicotte. Felsch hit a home run in the fourth inning that provided the winning margin. The White Sox beat the Giants in Game two by a score of 7\u20132 behind another complete game effort by Faber to take a 2\u20130 lead in the series.\n\nBack in New York for Game three, Cicotte again threw a complete game, but the White Sox could not muster a single run against Giants starter [[Rube Benton]] and lost 2\u20130. In Game 4 the White Sox were shut out again 5\u20130 by [[Ferdie Schupp]]. Faber threw another complete game, but the Series was going back to Chicago even at 2\u20132.\n\nReb Russell started Game 5 in Chicago, but only faced 3 batters before giving way to Cicotte. Going into the bottom of the seventh inning, Chicago was down 5\u20132, but they rallied to score three in the 7th and three in the 8th to win 8\u20135. Red Faber pitched the final two innings for the win. In Game six, the White Sox took an early 3\u20130 lead and on the strength of another complete game victory from Faber (his third of the Series) won 4\u20132 and clinched the world championship. Eddie Collins was the hitting hero, batting .409 over the six game series while Cicotte and Faber combined to pitch 50 out of a total 52 World Series innings to lead the staff.\n\n==1918\u20131920: The Black Sox==\n[[File:1919 Chicago White Sox.jpg|thumb|right|The 1919 Chicago White Sox]]\n\n{{main|1919 Chicago White Sox season}}\n\nAfter an off-year in the war-shortened season of [[1918 Major League Baseball season|1918]], the club bounced back to win the pennant in 1919 and entered the [[1919 World Series|World Series]] heavily favored to defeat the [[1919 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]] in a best-of-9.\n\nHowever, just before the Series, it became known that some big money was being bet on the Reds, fueling talk that the Series was [[match fixing|fixed]]. The White Sox lost to the Reds in eight games.\n\n===1920===\n{{main|1920 Chicago White Sox season}}\n\nRumors of a fix continued unabated through the [[1920 Major League Baseball season|1920]] campaign, even as the White Sox roared through the season and appeared well on their way to a third pennant in four years. The team's pitching was particularly strong that year; the 1920 White Sox pitching staff was the first in the majors to feature four 20-game winners.\n\n===Black Sox Scandal===\n{{main|Black Sox Scandal}}\n\nIn September 1920, an investigation into a fixed Cubs game eventually turned in the direction of the 1919 Series. During the investigation, Cicotte and Jackson confessed. Comiskey, who himself had turned a blind eye to the rumors, was compelled to suspend the remaining seven players (Gandil, eventually perceived as the ringleader, the one \"connected\" to the gamblers, had retired after the 1919 season) before their last season series against the [[1919 St. Louis Browns season|St. Louis Browns]]. The suspensions ground the team to a halt; they lost two out of three games to the Browns and finished second, two games behind the [[1920 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]]. However, the evidence of their involvement (signed confessions) disappeared from the [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]] courthouse. Lacking that tangible evidence, a criminal trial (whose scope was limited to the question of defrauding the public) ended in acquittals of all the players. Regardless, newly installed [[Commissioner of Baseball]] [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]] banned all the accused from baseball for life. He argued that even though the players had been acquitted, there was no dispute that they had broken the rules of baseball, and they could not ever be allowed to return if the game was to regain the trust of the public.\n\n==1922\u20131950: The lean years==\n[[File:TedLyonsGoudeycard.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Ted Lyons]]' 1933 [[Goudey]] baseball card.]]\nFrom 1901 to 1920, the White Sox won four out of a possible 19 pennants. However, they were severely crippled by the loss of seven of their best players in their prime. With a depleted roster, the [[1921 Chicago White Sox season|White Sox]] dropped into seventh place in {{MLBy|1921}} and would not contend again until {{MLBy|1936}}. During that stretch, only the {{MLBy|1925}} and {{MLBy|1926}} teams even managed to top .500. During this period, the White Sox featured stars such as third baseman [[Willie Kamm]], shortstop [[Luke Appling]], outfielder [[Leo Najo]] and pitcher [[Ted Lyons]]. However, an outstanding team was never developed around them, or a deep pitching staff. Ironically, the White Sox almost landed [[Babe Ruth]]; they offered to trade Jackson to the [[Boston Red Sox|Red Sox]] for Ruth after owner [[Harry Frazee]] put his troublemaking star on the market. The White Sox offered Jackson and $60,000; however, the [[New York Yankees]] offered an all-cash deal of $100,000. Between the dumping of star players by the [[History of the Philadelphia Athletics|Philadelphia Athletics]] and the Red Sox, and the decimation of the White Sox, a \"power vacuum\" was created in the American League, into which the Yankees would soon move.\n\nThe White Sox finally became competitive again under popular manager [[Jimmy Dykes]], who led them from 1934 to 1946&nbsp;\u2013 still the longest managerial tenure in team history. However, the White Sox did not completely recover from their malaise until the team was rebuilt in the 1950s under managers [[Paul Richards (baseball)|Paul Richards]], [[Marty Marion]], and [[Al L\u00f3pez]].\n\n==1950\u20131967: The Go-Go Era==\nFollowing Charles Comiskey's death in 1931, the team continued to be operated by his family&nbsp;\u2013 first by his son [[J. Louis Comiskey|Lou]], then by Louis' widow [[Grace Comiskey|Grace]], and finally by their daughter [[Dorothy Comiskey Rigney|Dorothy Rigney]]. Not until {{MLBy|1959}} did the team pass out of the family (thanks in part to a feud between Dorothy and her brother [[Chuck Comiskey|Chuck]]) to a new ownership group, led by [[Bill Veeck]], who had run the [[Cleveland Indians]] and the [[History of the St. Louis Browns|St. Louis Browns]].\n\nDuring the 1950s, the team had begun to restore its respectability with manager [[Paul Richards (baseball)|Paul Richards]] utilizing an offensive philosophy emphasizing speed and a spectacular style of defense.<ref name=\"A Fond Farewell To A Baseball Man Who Wasn't Afraid To Take Chances\">[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1065155/index.htm ''A Fond Farewell To A Baseball Man Who Wasn't Afraid To Take Chances'', by Henry Hecht, Sports Illustrated, August 25, 1986]</ref> Perennial All-Star [[Minnie Mi\u00f1oso]], a former Negro Leaguer who became the White Sox' first black player in {{MLBy|1951}}, personified both aspects, leading the league in stolen bases while hitting over .300 and providing terrific play in left field. The additions of rookie shortstop [[Luis Aparicio]] in 1956 and manager [[Al L\u00f3pez]] in 1957 continued the strengthening of the team, joining longtime team standouts such as [[Nellie Fox]] at second base, pitchers [[Billy Pierce]] and [[Virgil Trucks]], and catcher [[Sherm Lollar]]. The White Sox would lead the American League in stolen bases every year from {{MLBy|1951}} to {{MLBy|1961}}.\n\nAlthough the White Sox had winning records every season from 1951 through 1967, the Yankees dynasty of the era often left the White Sox frustrated in second place; they were league runner-up five times between 1957 and 1965. Health problems forced Veeck to sell the team to brothers [[Arthur Allyn, Jr.|Arthur]] and [[John Allyn]] in {{MLBy|1961}}, and while the team continued to play well, many of the ballpark thrills seemed to be missing. The White Sox had several outstanding pitching staffs in the 1960s, with pitchers who had the best ERA in four different seasons -- [[Frank Baumann (baseball)|Frank Baumann]], 2.67 ({{MLBy|1960}}), [[Gary Peters (baseball)|Gary Peters]], 2.33 ({{MLBy|1963}}), and again with 1.98 ({{MLBy|1966}}) and finally [[Joe Horlen]], 2.06 ({{MLBy|1967}}).\n\n===1959===\n{{Main|1959 Chicago White Sox season}}\n\nIn [[1959 Major League Baseball season|1959]], the team won its first pennant in 40 years, thanks to the efforts of several eventual Hall of Famers&nbsp;\u2013 Lopez, Aparicio, Fox (the league MVP), and pitcher [[Early Wynn]], who won the [[Cy Young Award]] at a time when only one award was presented for both leagues. The White Sox would also acquire slugger [[Ted Kluszewski]], a local area native, from the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] for the final pennant push. Kluszewski gave the team a much-needed slugger for the stretch run, and he hit nearly .300 for the White Sox in the final month. Lopez had also managed the [[1954 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]] to the [[1954 World Series|World Series]] in [[1954 Major League Baseball season|1954]], making him the only manager to interrupt the New York Yankees pennant run between 1949 and 1964 inclusive.\n\n====1959 World Series====\n{{main|1959 World Series}}\n\nAfter the pennant-clinching victory, Chicago Mayor [[Richard J. Daley]], a lifelong White Sox fan, ordered his fire chief to set off the city's [[civil defense siren|air raid sirens]]. Many Chicagoans became fearful and confused since 1959 was the height of the [[Cold War]]; however, they relaxed somewhat upon realizing it was part of the White Sox' celebration. The White Sox won Game 1 of the World Series 11\u20130 on the strength of Kluszewski's two home runs, their last postseason home win until [[2005 American League Division Series|2005]]. The [[1959 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]], however, won three of the next four games and captured their first World Series championship since moving to the west coast in 1958. 92,706 fans witnessed Game 5 of the World Series at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]], the most ever to attend a World Series game, or for that matter any non-exhibition major league baseball game. The White Sox won that game 1\u20130 over the Dodgers' 23-year-old pitcher [[Sandy Koufax]], but the Dodgers clinched the series by beating the White Sox 9\u20133 two days later at Comiskey Park.\n\n===Veeck ownership===\nDue to Veeck's arrival in 1959, Comiskey Park instantly became a ballpark filled with a series of promotional stunts which helped draw record crowds, the most obvious being the exploding [[fireworks]] Veeck installed in the scoreboard to celebrate home runs and victories.  And in 1960, they became the first team in the history of sports to wear last names on the back of their jerseys, a Veeck innovation.  Unlike Charles Comiskey, Veeck was considered a player-friendly owner, and players enjoyed playing for him.\n\n===1964===\n{{main|1964 Chicago White Sox season}}\n\nThe {{MLBy|1964}} season was especially frustrating, as the team won 98 games, four more than 1959, including their last nine in a row&nbsp;\u2013 yet finished one game behind the pennant-winning [[1964 New York Yankees season|Yankees]], who had a late-season 11-game win streak that opened up just enough room to stave off the White Sox's final charge.\n\n===1967===\n{{main|1967 Chicago White Sox season}}\n\nThe White Sox were also involved in one of the closest pennant races in history in [[1967 Major League Baseball season|1967]]. After leading the American League for most of the season, on the final weekend, the White Sox, [[1967 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]], [[1967 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]] and [[1967 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]] all had a shot at the pennant. However, the Red Sox would assert themselves in the final weekend, beating the Twins to take the pennant by a single game. The White Sox finished in fourth place at 89\u201373, three games behind.\n\n==1968\u20131975: Threats of relocation==\nIn {{baseball year|1968}}, [[Bud Selig]], a former minority owner of the [[Milwaukee Braves (1953\u201365)|Milwaukee Braves]] who had been unable to stop the relocation of his team three years earlier, contracted with the Allyn brothers to host nine home games (one against each of the other American League clubs) at [[Milwaukee County Stadium]] as part of an attempt to attract an expansion franchise to [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]].\n\nThe experiment was staggeringly successful&nbsp;\u2014 those nine games drew 264,297 fans. In Chicago that season, the [[1968 Chicago White Sox season|White Sox]] drew 539,478 fans to their remaining 58 home dates (72 games, 14 doubleheaders). In just a handful of games, the Milwaukee crowds accounted for nearly one-third of the total attendance at White Sox games.\n\nIn {{MLBy|1969}}, the league expanded from 10 teams to 12, and the [[1969 Chicago White Sox season|White Sox]] schedule in Milwaukee was likewise expanded to include 11 home games (again, one against every opponent). Although those games were attended by slightly fewer fans (198,211 fans, for an average of 18,019) they represented a greater percentage of the total White Sox attendance than the previous year&nbsp;\u2014 over one-third of the fans who went to White Sox games did so at Milwaukee County Stadium. In the remaining 59 home dates in Chicago (70 games, 11 doubleheaders), the White Sox drew 391,335 for an average of 6,632 per date.\n\nSelig was denied an expansion franchise at the [[1968 Major League Baseball expansion draft|1968 owners' meetings]], and turned his efforts toward purchasing and relocating an existing club. His search began close to home with the White Sox themselves. According to Selig, he had a handshake agreement with [[Arthur Allyn]] in early 1969 to purchase a majority stake in the White Sox and move them north to Milwaukee. The American League, however, blocked the sale, unwilling to cede what was then the nation's second largest city to the National League and the Cubs. Arthur Allyn instead sold his shares to his brother John, who agreed to stay in Chicago. Selig would go on to buy the [[Milwaukee Brewers|Seattle Pilots]] and move them to Milwaukee instead. John Allyn renamed Comiskey Park \"White Sox Park\" and installed [[artificial turf]] (\"Sox Sod\") in the infield (the outfield remained natural grass).\n\nThe 1970 White Sox hit rock bottom for the franchise in the post-World War II era, going a Major League worst 56-106, nine games worse than the second-year [[Milwaukee Brewers]], and seven worse than another 1969 expansion team, the [[San Diego Padres]].\n\nThe [[1972 Chicago White Sox season|White Sox]] had a brief resurgence in {{MLBy|1972}}, with slugger [[Dick Allen]] winning the MVP award; but injuries, especially to popular third baseman [[Bill Melton]], took their toll and the team finished 5\u00bd games behind [[1972 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland]], the eventual world champion.\n\nSeveral lawsuits against Major League Baseball from Seattle over the move of the Pilots to Milwaukee almost resulted in the White Sox being moved to the Emerald City in {{MLBy|1975}}. An elaborate scheme for a franchise shuffle soon came to light. The White Sox were to be moved to Seattle, then the [[Oakland Athletics]] were to take the White Sox's place in Comiskey Park. Oakland owner [[Charlie Finley]] was from nearby [[La Porte, Indiana]]. His A's had not drawn well during their Championship years in [[Oakland, California]], and he wanted to bring them to Chicago. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} However, the shuffle collapsed when owner [[John Allyn]] sold the team to the physically rehabilitated Bill Veeck. In {{MLBy|1977}}, the [[Seattle Mariners]] were created, thus restoring the major leagues' presence in the [[Pacific Northwest]].\n\n==1976\u20131981: The Return of Veeck and the South Side Hitmen==\nOn December 10, {{MLBy|1975}}, [[Bill Veeck]] regained ownership of the team, and he vowed to make the White Sox an exciting team again. Besides his customary promotions, Veeck introduced retro uniforms and shorts. The shorts were only worn three times.  The first time was during the initial game of a doubleheader against the [[1976 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]] at Comiskey Park on August 8, 1976, followed by appearances on August 21 and August 22.<ref>[http://www.freewebs.com/karamaxjoe/thewhitesoxshorts.htm The White Sox Shorts'The Ugly History']</ref> The {{MLBy|1976}} team was one of the worst White Sox teams ever, winning only 64 games (.398), drawing fewer than 915,000 fans.\n\nVeeck's strategy to make the team competitive quickly, dubbed \"rent-a-player\" by sports writers, involved acquiring star players entering the final year of their contracts. The theory was that the players would strive to put up huge numbers in hopes of getting a big contract at the end of the season, and carry the club with them. The first of these acquisitions was made prior to the [[1977 Major League Baseball season|1977 season]] and the last prior to the [[1978 Major League Baseball season|1978 season]]. While this approach had the virtue of not having been tried, it was unsustainable. The Sox had to give up several young prospects in exchange for veteran players who invariably signed with other clubs after their single season in Chicago.\n\nDuring this period the Sox acquired several players who were once stars but were past their primes. One was [[Don Kessinger]], a shortstop who had his best years with the crosstown [[Chicago Cubs|Cubs]]. Kessinger served as a [[Player-coach|player-manager]] in [[1979 Major League Baseball season|1979]]. Another was outfielder [[Ralph Garr]], who had his best seasons with the [[Atlanta Braves]]. A once-notable pitcher was [[Blue Moon Odom|John \"Blue Moon\" Odom]], a former [[Oakland Athletics]] star. On July 28, 1976, Odom combined with [[Francisco Barrios]] on a no-hitter against [[1976 Major League Baseball season|Oakland]], which proved to be Odom's last major league victory. The Sox also brought in [[Clay Carroll]], a right-handed relief pitcher who was a key member of the [[Cincinnati Reds]] championship teams in the mid-1970s.\n\nUnlike most of his fellow owners, Veeck had no income apart from the White Sox. More or less out of necessity, Veeck looked for any edge he could find. The club held open tryouts during spring training in [[1978 Major League Baseball season|1978]]. They looked at pretty much anyone who showed up. Each player's name was sewn on his uniform, ostensibly to prove that the tryouts were legitimate and not just a stunt. This approach was the subject of an article in ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''. The spring training tryout became a White Sox tradition that continues to this day.<ref>[http://mlb.mlb.com/cws/ballpark/cws_ballpark_guide_dir.jsp#t MLB.com]</ref>\n\n===1977===\n{{main|1977 Chicago White Sox season}}\n\nThe [[1977 Major League Baseball season|1977 season]] was a memorable one for the South Siders, led by off-season acquisitions [[Oscar Gamble]] (.297 AVG, 31 HR, 83 RBI), [[Richie Zisk]] (.290 AVG, 30 HR, 101 RBI) and American League Comeback Player of the Year [[Eric Soderholm]] (.280 AVG, 25 HR, 67 RBI). The team, known by the press and fans as the \"South Side Hitmen\" hit a since-broken team record 192 home runs and were in first place in the American League West as late as August en route to a third-place finish (90\u201372). They also drew a team-record 1,657,135 fans to Comiskey (since broken as well). Manager [[Bob Lemon]] was named AL Manager of the Year by [[United Press International|UPI]] for his efforts.<ref>[http://whitesoxinteractive.com/History&Glory/1977.htm Whitesoxinteractive.com]</ref>\n\n===1978===\n{{main|1978 Chicago White Sox season}}\n\nAfter the 1977 season Gamble and Zisk signed with other teams&nbsp;\u2014 Gamble with the [[San Diego Padres]] and Zisk with the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]. Veeck's attempt to replace them with [[Bobby Bonds]] and [[Ron Blomberg]] fizzled as the [[1978 Major League Baseball season|1978]] team lost 90 games. Bonds appeared in only 26 games for the Sox before being dealt to the Texas Rangers, and Blomberg's major league career ended with the season's final game.\n\n===1979\u20131981===\nTwo tough years followed: 87 losses in {{MLBy|1979}} (including the infamous July 12 forfeit on [[Disco Demolition Night]]) and 90 losses in {{MLBy|1980}}.\n\nVeeck began building a farm system that produced several noteworthy players including [[Harold Baines]] and [[Britt Burns]]. But Veeck could not compete in the free agent market or afford what he called \"the high price of mediocrity.\" By 1980, the White Sox were looking for new ownership. Veeck favored Ohio real estate tycoon [[Edward J. DeBartolo, Sr.]], whose family owned the NFL's [[San Francisco 49ers]] and the NHL's [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] and had tried to buy several MLB teams and move them to [[New Orleans]]. DeBartolo pleaded to be allowed to buy the White Sox and he promised to keep the team in Chicago. Baseball commissioner [[Bowie Kuhn]] blocked the deal, because he thought DeBartolo would be bad for baseball.\n\n==1982\u20132004: The early Reinsdorf era==\nInstead, Veeck sold the team to an ownership group headed by accountant [[Jerry Reinsdorf]] and television producer [[Eddie Einhorn]]. The new owners moved quickly to show that they were committed to winning by signing All-Star catcher [[Carlton Fisk]] from the Red Sox as well as power-hitting outfielder [[Greg Luzinski]] from the defending champion Phillies during the 1980\u201381 offseason. They also retained the club's young, relatively unknown manager, [[Tony La Russa]].\n\n===1983: \"Winning Ugly\"===\n[[File:Harold baines2001.jpg|thumb|right|[[Harold Baines]], one of the White Sox's franchise players throughout the 1980s, became one of the organization's all-time top hitting leaders during his 14 seasons in Chicago]]\n{{Main|1983 Chicago White Sox season}}\n\nIn [[1983 Major League Baseball season|1983]], the White Sox enjoyed their best success in a generation. After a mediocre first half, the White Sox decided that they needed speed at the top of the lineup. The Sox traded second baseman [[Tony Bernazard]] to the Mariners for [[Julio Cruz (baseball)|Julio Cruz]]. With Cruz's speed, they went 60\u201325 to close out the season, clinching the AL West title, which earned Manager [[Tony La Russa]] his first Manager of the Year award.\n\n[[Doug Rader]], then-manager of the Texas Rangers, derisively accused the team of \"winning ugly\" for their style of play, which reflected a tendency to win games through scrappy play rather than strong hitting or pitching. Rader also thought that if the White Sox played in the Eastern Division, they would finish fifth behind powerhouses such as [[1983 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore]], [[1983 New York Yankees season|New York]], and [[1983 Milwaukee Brewers season|Milwaukee]]. Chicago media and White Sox fans picked up on the phrase, and turned \"Winning Ugly\" into the team slogan. While they had a great run in the regular season, they were not able to carry that over into the postseason as they lost to a powerful Baltimore Orioles team three games to one in the [[1983 American League Championship Series|AL Championship Series]]. [[LaMarr Hoyt]] led the White Sox to a 2\u20131 victory in Game 1, but the Orioles clinched the series with a 3\u20130 ten-inning victory in Game 4. White Sox pitcher Burns pitched a \"gutsy\" game, throwing 9\u2153 shutout innings before a home run by [[Tito Landrum]] broke up the game and the hearts of the South Side faithful.\n\n===1985\u20131989===\nThe club slid back into mediocrity for the rest of the 1980s, contending only in [[1985 Major League Baseball season|1985]]. Before the 1985 season began, the White Sox traded pitcher [[LaMarr Hoyt]] to the [[San Diego Padres]] in exchange for flashy shortstop [[Ozzie Guill\u00e9n]]. Guillen would win the AL Rookie of the Year award. In 1986, broadcaster-turned-general manager [[Ken Harrelson|Ken \"Hawk\" Harrelson]] fired La Russa after a poor start. The club wouldn't contend again until 1990, the final year in [[Comiskey Park]].\n\n===1990s: \"Good Guys Wear Black\"===\n\n====1990====\n{{Main|1990 Chicago White Sox season}}\n[[File:Old comiskey park.jpg|thumb|right|The Chicago White Sox hosting a home game at Comiskey Park in 1990]]\nThat season, most of their young talent blossomed. Closer [[Bobby Thigpen]] established a then record of 57 saves. In addition to that, first baseman [[Frank Thomas (designated hitter)|Frank Thomas]], pitchers [[Alex Fernandez (baseball)|Alex Fernandez]] and [[Jack McDowell]], and third baseman [[Robin Ventura]] would make their presences felt on the South Side. The White Sox of {{baseball year|1990}} won 94 games, but finished 9 games behind the powerful [[1990 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]].\n\nOn July 11, as part of the celebration of Comiskey Park, the White Sox played a Turn Back the Clock game against the [[1990 Milwaukee Brewers season|Milwaukee Brewers]]; the Brewers won 12\u20139 in 13 innings after posting a 6-run rally in the 8th inning to tie the game. The White Sox wore their 1917 home uniforms. This was the first Turn Back the Clock game in the major leagues and started what has become a popular promotion. New Comiskey Park opened in 1991, and was completed at a cost of $167 million.\n\n====1993====\n{{Main|1993 Chicago White Sox season}}\n\nThe team reached the [[1993 American League Championship Series|ALCS]] in {{baseball year|1993}}. The White Sox were led by Thomas, Ventura, multi-sport star [[Bo Jackson]], Cy Young Award winner McDowell and All-Star closer [[Roberto Hern\u00e1ndez (relief pitcher)|Roberto Hern\u00e1ndez]] and won the last AL West before realignment with a 94\u201368 record. However, the White Sox were a big disappointment in the [[1993 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], losing to the defending World Champion [[1993 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]] in six games. The Jays would go on to win the [[1993 World Series|World Series]] again in 1993.\n\n====1994====\n{{Main|1994 Chicago White Sox season}}\n\nThe White Sox led the new [[American League Central]] at the time of the [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|1994 players' strike]].\n\n====1995-1999====\n\nAlthough struggling in the 1995 season, the Sox maintained some consistency through the rest of the 1990s, managing to finish in second place every year after, including 1997, the year of the notorious [[White Flag Trade]]. Although maligned by fans at the time, the move would ultimately help the team out later.\n\n===2000\u20132004===\n\n====2000: The Kids Can Play====\n{{Main|2000 Chicago White Sox season}}\n\nUnder Manager [[Jerry Manuel]], the White Sox fielded a talented but chronically under-achieving team. In {{baseball year|2000}}, however, the White Sox had one of their best teams since the 1983 club. This team, whose slogan was \"The Kids Can Play\", won 95 games en route to an AL Central division title. The team scored runs at a blistering pace, which enabled them to overcome the effects of a mediocre pitching staff, led by [[Mike Sirotka]] and [[James Baldwin (baseball)|James Baldwin]]. Frank Thomas nearly won his third MVP award with his offensive output; he was helped by good offensive years from [[Magglio Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez]], [[Paul Konerko]], [[Carlos Lee]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Valent\u00edn]].\n\nAs in 1983 and 1993, the 2000 team could not carry its success over into the postseason, getting swept by the wild-card [[2000 Seattle Mariners season|Seattle Mariners]] in the [[2000 American League Division Series|Division Series]]. Despite new club records for hits (1,615), runs scored (978), RBI (926), home runs (216), and doubles (325), the White Sox hit only .185 in the ALDS and failed to score a run after the third inning in any of the three games.\n\n====2003-04====\n{{Main|2003 Chicago White Sox season}}\n\nIn [[2003 Major League Baseball season|2003]], Comiskey Park was renamed after cell phone company [[U.S. Cellular]] bought the naming rights at $68 million over 20 years, a very unpopular move among fans. In 2003 The All Star game was held for the first time at their new park. Although briefly leading the central in September (the first time since 1906 both Chicago teams were in First at the same time), the Sox ultimately finished four games behind the Twins.\n\nIn 2004, the team named [[Ozzie Guillen]] as the 37th manager in team history. Although again finishing in second place, losing streaks in August and September, along with various injuries, sunk the team. Several changes were made in the offseason, including trading [[Carlos Lee]] to the Brewers for [[Scott Podsednik]]. Although [[Magglio Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez]] was nearly traded to the Red Sox for [[Nomar Garciaparra]], the deal fell through and Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez left as a free agent to sign with the Tigers.\n\n==2005: The drought ends==\n[[File:Ozzie Guill\u00e9n.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ozzie Guill\u00e9n]] not only made a name for himself as a solid defensive shortstop with the White Sox in the 1980s-90s, but also as the team's manager from 2004\u20132011 where he led the franchise to a World Series title]]\n{{Main|2005 Chicago White Sox season}}\n\nThe changes made an immediate impact on the team. In {{baseball year|2005}}, the White Sox posted the best record in the major leagues for much of the year, before a late season slump saw the [[2005 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] overtake them (100 wins vs. 99 wins). Though a serious challenge for their dominance of the division was mounted late in the year by the [[2005 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]] (the Tribe actually reduced what was once a 15-game lead for the White Sox down to 1\u00bd games at one point only to lose the last 7 games), Chicago scored a 4\u20132 victory over the [[2005 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]] on September 29 to win their first AL Central Division title since 2000. Finishing at 99\u201363 (.611) tied their 1983 record, and won the division by six games. The last time they had a higher percentage than that was 1920, when they finished second in the league thanks to the late-season \"Black Sox\" suspensions. The combination of the league's best record with the American League victory in the All-Star Game gave the White Sox the home field advantage throughout the 2005 postseason (perhaps unnecessary as the White Sox won every post-season road game they played in 2005).\n\n===2005 ALDS===\nIn the [[2005 American League Division Series]], the White Sox took on the [[2005 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]], the 2005 AL [[Major League Baseball wild card|wild-card]] winners and the defending World Series champions. The White Sox defeated the Red Sox in a three-game sweep. They won the first two games (scoring a 14\u20132 victory in the first game&nbsp;\u2013 their first postseason win at home since [[1959 World Series|1959]]&nbsp;\u2013 and 5\u20134 in the second) of the series at home before claiming a 5\u20133 victory at [[Fenway Park]] in Boston. Scott Podsednik hit his first home run of the season in the first game of the series.\n\nThe ALDS also set the tone for what would be an unusually suspenseful post-season; while their first game was considered a blow-out, the remaining games saw the White Sox making the most of rare opportunities and hanging on to narrow leads. In the first inning of game 1, the White Sox put up 5 runs, and never looked back. A late inning three-run home run by [[Scott Podsednik]] \u2013 his first home run of the season, was the icing on the cake in the game 1 blowout. In Game 2, the White Sox were actually down 4\u20132 when Red Sox second baseman [[Tony Graffanino]], formerly playing for the White Sox, let [[Juan Uribe]]'s potential inning-ending, double-play grounder go through his legs; one out later, [[Tadahito Iguchi]] hit a three-run homer to left that clinched the game for the White Sox. In Game 3, [[Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez]] entered the game with the bases loaded and nobody out with the White Sox ahead by only one run in the bottom of the sixth inning. Based on their regular season performance, it was later calculated that the Red Sox's probability of winning at that point was .662, even though they were trailing by one run. Instead, the first two batters, [[Jason Varitek]] and [[Tony Graffanino]], both popped out, and [[Johnny Damon]] struck out swinging on a breaking ball. Hernandez went on to retire six of the next seven batters, and the White Sox's rookie reliever [[Bobby Jenks]] closed out the game.\n\n===2005 ALCS===\nThe White Sox then moved on to face the [[2005 Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim season|Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]] in the [[2005 American League Championship Series|ALCS]]. The Angels won Game 1, 3\u20132, The White Sox only post-season loss.\n\nIn Game 2 on October 12, the teams were involved in one of the most controversial endings in baseball playoff history. With the score tied 1\u20131 with two outs in the bottom of the ninth, A. J. Pierzynski apparently struck out to end the inning. At first Pierzynski headed back to the dugout but ran to first base upon realizing that umpire [[Doug Eddings]] had ruled that Angels catcher [[Josh Paul]] (a former White Sox player) did not field the ball cleanly, meaning he would have to either tag the batter or throw to the first baseman to record the out (see [[uncaught third strike]]). Despite vehement protests from various members of the Angels, including manager [[Mike Scioscia]], Pierzynski was awarded first base. Pinch-runner [[Pablo Ozuna]] replaced Pierzynski and stole second base. Third baseman [[Joe Crede]] then delivered a double on the third pitch to give the White Sox a 2\u20131 win. Overshadowed by that play was the 1-run, 5-hit complete game pitched by [[Mark Buehrle]]. Buehrle's excellent effort allowed the White Sox to capture their first-ever home victory in ALCS history.\n\nBuoyed by their win, the White Sox traveled to Anaheim, California, where starters [[Jon Garland]], [[Freddy Garc\u00eda]], and [[Jos\u00e9 Contreras]] (who had dropped Game 1 to the Angels in Chicago) pitched three more complete game victories consecutively over the Angels, giving the White Sox their first American League pennant since 1959. White Sox slugger [[Paul Konerko]] was named the ALCS MVP, on the strength of his two home runs, 7 RBI, and .286 average.\n\nEspecially in light of the evolution of the game, the White Sox four straight complete games was considered an unbelievable achievement. In fact, since Jos\u00e9 Contreras pitched 8\u2153 innings in game 1, the White Sox bullpen saw a total of \u2154 of an inning pitched (by [[Neal Cotts]]) in the entire series. The last time four consecutive complete games had been pitched in a championship series was in the [[1956 World Series]] between the [[1956 Brooklyn Dodgers season|Brooklyn Dodgers]] and [[1928 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]], and the [[1928 World Series|1928 Yankees]] were the last team to win four consecutive complete games in a championship series. In fact, the last time any major league pitching staff had hurled four straight complete game victories was near the end of the [[1983 Major League Baseball season|1983 regular season]], when the [[1983 Texas Rangers season|Texas Rangers]] accomplished the feat.\n\n===2005 World Series===\nThe White Sox now advanced to the [[2005 World Series|World Series]], where they would take on the National League champion [[2005 Houston Astros season|Houston Astros]]. The White Sox' appearance in the World Series was bittersweet for longtime franchise star [[Frank Thomas (designated hitter)|Frank Thomas]]. One of the most popular and productive players in the franchise's long history, Thomas would finally be going to a World Series in his 16th major league season. However, due to injury, Thomas would be unable to participate except as an observer, and his contributions to the White Sox in 2005 were limited.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:WhiteSoxChampionsPlaza2.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Champions Plaza, U.S. Cellular Field \u2013 Chicago]] -->\n[[File:Chicago3 SvG.jpg|right|thumb|Chicago skyline during the World Series supporting the White Sox]]\nGame 1 saw Astros' ace [[Roger Clemens]] leave the game with a hamstring injury, leaving [[Jos\u00e9 Contreras]] to finish up the Astros and Chicago took advantage of its opponents' weakness, winning 5\u20133. [[Joe Crede]] especially made an impressive showing with his stellar defensive plays at third base.\n\nGame 2 of the Series, as in the ALCS, saw the White Sox again involved in a controversial play. With the White Sox down 4\u20132 in the seventh with two outs and two runners on base, the home plate umpire ruled that [[Jermaine Dye]] had been hit by a pitch, while the Astros argued (and TV replays confirmed) that the ball had actually hit the bat. Dye was given a free pass to first, and the next batter, Paul Konerko, launched a grand slam into left field to give Chicago a 6\u20134 lead. Houston tied the game on a two-run single with two outs in the top of the ninth, but in the bottom of the ninth, [[Scott Podsednik]] hit a walk-off solo home run off [[Brad Lidge]] to give the White Sox a thrilling 7\u20136 victory and a 2\u20130 lead in the Series. Podsednik was the first player in major league history to hit a home run in the World Series after not having hit any during the regular season. (He did, however, have a home run in Game 1 of the ALDS against Boston, making the World Series home run his second of the playoffs.)\n\nThe World Series then shifted to Houston for Game 3, in which Astros' starter and NLCS MVP [[Roy Oswalt]] cruised with a 4\u20130 lead until the wheels totally came off for him with a five-run fifth by the White Sox. The Astros managed to tie the game in the eighth, but repeatedly blew scoring opportunities in the next few innings. Finally, in the top of the 14th, former Astro [[Geoff Blum]] hit a tie-breaking home run; the White Sox took a commanding 3\u20130 Series lead with a 7\u20135 victory in the longest World Series game in history (in terms of time; tied for most innings). [[Ozzie Guill\u00e9n]] sent [[Mark Buehrle]] in to get the last out in the bottom of the 14th to get the save after he had started Game 2, and later remarked that he was set to send [[Pablo Ozuna]] (a position player) in to pitch if the Astros somehow extended the game.\n\nGame 4 was a pitcher's duel between [[Freddy Garc\u00eda]] and [[Brandon Backe]]. The game was scoreless until [[Jermaine Dye]] singled to center off of Brad Lidge, driving in [[Willie Harris]] for what turned out to be the winning run. This was the second game of the series in which Lidge had given up the game-winning run (Podesednik's home run in Game 2). Game 4 also saw a spectacular defensive play by [[Juan Uribe]], as the Chicago shortstop fell two rows into the stands in order to retire [[Chris Burke (baseball)|Chris Burke]] for the second out in the bottom of the ninth. Uribe also earned the assist in the final out of the Series on the next play, as he narrowly threw [[Orlando Palmeiro]] out at first to give the White Sox their first World Series crown since [[1917 World Series|1917]].\n\n{{quote|A grounder up the middle, past [[Bobby Jenks|Jenks]], Uribe has it, he throws- OUT!

Their 11\u20131 postseason record was tied with [[1999 New York Yankees season|1999 Yankees]] as the best single post season mark. (Only [[1976 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]] in [[1976 Major League Baseball season|1976]] had a better winning percentage by going 7\u20130.) Also, their 8-game winning streak (the four wins over the Angels and the sweep against the Astros) is tied with the Boston Red Sox (who won 8 games in a row en route to their 2004 World Series championship) for the longest postseason winning streak in Major League history. The White Sox also became the first team to win all three post-season victories on the road. Amazingly, despite their 105-year history, this was only the franchise's third World Series championship, (following victories in 1917 and 1906). It also marked their first pennant since the advent of divisional play in 1969 (the White Sox won the inaugural American League pennant in 1901, but this was 2 years prior to the first modern World Series).\n\n==2006\u2013present: Post-World Series==\n\n===2006 season===\n[[File:Jim Thome 2008.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jim Thome]]]]\n{{Main|2006 Chicago White Sox season}}\n\nAfter leading the wild card race for much of the season, the White Sox faltered, losing 15 of 24 at the beginning of September to eliminate them from playoff contention, ending their chances of becoming the first repeat winner of the World Series since the New York Yankees in 1999 and 2000. They nonetheless finished with a 90\u201372 record, the season's best record by a non-playoff team.\n\nThis was the first year a White Sox manager had led the AL All-Star squad since 1994, when Gene Lamont led the team. In addition to manager Ozzie Guill\u00e9n, the White Sox had six representatives at the [[2006 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|77th All-Star Game]] at [[PNC Park]] in [[Pittsburgh]], the most among any club: starting pitcher [[Mark Buehrle]], closer [[Bobby Jenks]], catcher [[A. J. Pierzynski]], first basemen [[Paul Konerko]] and [[Jim Thome]], and right fielder [[Jermaine Dye]]. [[Jos\u00e9 Contreras]] was originally selected to pitch in the All-Star Game, but was replaced by [[Francisco Liriano]]. Guillen removed Contreras from the roster after a 117-pitch performance in a 19-inning game against Boston on the last day before the All-Star Break.\n\nPierzynski was the last White Sox to be named to the team after winning the year's [[All-Star Final Vote|Final Vote]], in which the fans select the 32nd and final player on both the AL and NL squads. Pierzynski is the second White Sox to be selected, following [[Scott Podsednik]]'s nomination in 2005. Dye competed in the 2006 CENTURY 21 [[Home Run Derby]]; he managed to hit 7 home runs in the first round, but [[David Ortiz]] and [[Ryan Howard]] both surpassed that total to knock Dye out of the competition.\n\nThe White Sox drew 2,957,414 fans for an average of 36,511, third in the AL. There were a total of 52 sellouts, breaking the previous team record of 18. The White Sox also drew 75 crowds in excess of 30,000, another franchise record.\n\n===2007 season===\n{{Main|2007 Chicago White Sox season}}\n\nOn April 18, Buehrle pitched a [[no-hitter]] against the [[2007 Texas Rangers season|Texas Rangers]], 6\u20130. Buehrle's only blemish was a walk to [[Sammy Sosa]] in the fifth, but Buehrle would promptly pick Sosa off during the next at-bat. Buehrle secured his spot in the MLB record books when he forced Rangers catcher [[Gerald Laird]] to ground out to third baseman [[Joe Crede]] at 9:14 P.M. CDT, sending the crowd of 25,390 at [[U.S. Cellular Field]] into a frenzy. He would face the minimum of 27 batters using 106 pitches (66 strikes), with the one walk to Sosa and eight strikeouts. [[Jermaine Dye]] hit a [[grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] and [[Jim Thome]] added two solo homers in the history-making night.\n\nOn July 6, the White Sox announced the signing of Mark Buehrle to a contract extension worth $56 million over four years. The move came after weeks of rumors of Buehrle possibly being traded.\n\nOverall, the White Sox season was hampered by injuries and a team-wide hitting slump. However, the season was not a complete failure with Mark Buehrle's no hitter, Jim Thome's 500th home run, and closer [[Bobby Jenks]] 41 consecutive batters retired (tying Jim Barr's all-time record and breaking the American League record.) Jenks would later fall short of the all-time record when Kansas City Royal's player [[Joey Gathright]] slapped a ground ball into left field just out of the reaches of third baseman [[Josh Fields (infielder)|Josh Fields]] and shortstop [[Juan Uribe]].\n\nThe White Sox finished the season fourth in their division with a 72\u201390 record, behind the [[2007 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]], [[2007 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]], and [[2007 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]].\n\n===2008 Season: Central champs again and a \"blackout game\"===\n{{Main|2008 Chicago White Sox season}}\n\nOn July 31, the day of the trade deadline, the White Sox traded relief pitcher [[Nick Masset]] and minor leaguer 2nd Baseman [[Danny Richar]] for [[Ken Griffey, Jr.]] of the [[Cincinnati Reds]].<ref>[http://www.local12.com/content/breaking_news/story.aspx?content_id=b91cb11a-b7f2-4c06-a821-3a0ede26aa07 Local112.com]{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nOn August 14, [[Jim Thome]], [[Paul Konerko]], [[Alexei Ram\u00edrez]], and [[Juan Uribe]] combined to hit four consecutive home runs, something that has only been done six other times in the history of [[Major League Baseball]].\n\nOn September 29, 2008, Ramirez hit his fourth grand slam of the season, setting a major-league single-season record for a rookie, off of Detroit Tigers pitcher Gary Glover in an 8\u20132 White Sox victory to qualify the [[2008 Chicago White Sox season|White Sox]] for a [[2008 American League Central tie-breaker game|one-game playoff]] against the [[2008 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]] for the AL Central title.

A game saving throw to home plate from center-fielder Ken Griffey Jr. to catcher [[A. J.

The only run of the game came from a [[Jim Thome]] home run, the 541st of his career.  This was the lowest scoring tiebreaker game in MLB history.  The White Sox are also the only team in MLB history to beat three different teams on three consecutive days: the [[2008 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]], [[2008 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]], and [[2008 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]].

They are one of eight charter members of the [[American League]], having played in Chicago since the inaugural 1901 season. They have won six [[List of American League pennant winners|American League pennants]] and three [[World Series]] titles, most recently in 2005. Despite long periods of mediocrity, the White Sox have among the most unusual, challenging, and celebrated histories of any Major League franchise.\n\n==Establishment==\nThe team began as the minor league [[Sioux City, Iowa|Sioux City]] Cornhuskers and played in the [[Western League (original)|Western League]]. The WL reorganized itself in November {{baseball year|1893}}, with [[Ban Johnson]] as President. The Cornhuskers won the Western League Pennant in their first season in 1894. Johnson, a Cincinnati-based reporter, had been recommended by his friend [[Charles Comiskey]], former major league star with the [[St. Louis Browns (NL)|St. Louis Browns]] in the 1880s, who was then managing the [[Cincinnati Reds]].  After the {{baseball year|1894}} season, when Comiskey's contract with the Reds was up, he decided to take his chances at ownership. He bought the Sioux City team and transferred it to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], where it enjoyed some success over the next five seasons.\n\nIn {{baseball year|1900}}, the Western League changed its name to the [[American League]]. It was still officially a [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]], subject to the governing National Agreement and an underling of the [[National League]]. The NL gave permission to the AL to put a team in [[Chicago]], provided they not use the city name in the team's branding. Comiskey moved his St. Paul club to the [[Near South Side, Chicago|Near South Side]] and renamed it the '''White Stockings''', grabbing a nickname that had once been used by the [[Chicago Cubs]]. The White Stockings won the 1900 American League pennant led by [[Player-coach|player-manager]] [[Dick Padden]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Spink|first=Alfred Henry|title=The National Game|publisher=SIU Press|year=2000|edition=2nd|isbn=0-8093-2304-4|page=286}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=James|first=Bill|authorlink=Bill James|title=[[The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract|The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract]]|page=91}}</ref> the final WL/AL championship season as a minor league.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://chicago.whitesox.mlb.com/cws/history/significant_dates.jsp |title=White Sox Significant Dates {{!}} WhiteSox.com: History<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2011-10-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716145220/http://chicago.whitesox.mlb.com/cws/history/significant_dates.jsp |archive-date=2011-07-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref> After the season, the AL declined to renew its membership in the National Agreement and declared itself a major league.\n\n==1901\u20131917: Early years==\n[[File:South Side Park, home of the White Sox, Chicago, Illinois, circa 1907-1913.jpg|thumb|Comiskey Park, then known as \"White Sox Park,\" in the early 1910s]]\nAfter acquiring a number of stars from the older league, including pitcher and manager [[Clark Griffith]], the White Stockings also captured the AL's first major-league pennant the next year, in {{MLBy|1901}}. Headline editors at the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' sports department immediately began shortening the name to \"White Sox\", and the team officially adopted the shorter name in {{MLBy|1904}}. The name change to the White Sox was brought on after scorekeeper Christoph Hynes wrote White Sox at the top of a scorecard rather than White Stockings, this scorecard was then seen by the press. The White Sox would continue to be built on pitching and defense in the following years, led by pitching workhorse [[Ed Walsh]], who routinely pitched over 400 innings each season in his prime.\n\n===1906: The Hitless Wonders===\n[[File:Ed Walsh portrait 1911.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Ed Walsh]] was a dominant starter for the White Sox from 1904 to 1916 and holds the lowest career ERA in Major League history.]]\nWalsh, [[Doc White]] and [[Nick Altrock]] paced the [[1906 Chicago White Sox season|White Sox]] to their {{MLBy|1906}} pennant and faced the crosstown rival [[1906 Chicago Cubs season|Cubs]] in the [[1906 World Series]]. The Cubs had won a then-record 116 regular-season games and were an overwhelming favorite to defeat the White Sox, especially since the White Sox had the lowest team batting average in the American League that year. However, in a stunning upset, the White Sox took the Series, and intracity bragging rights, in six games. To this day, the 1906 White Sox are known as \"the Hitless Wonders.\"\n\nThe White Sox spent the next decade alternating between solid and mediocre seasons. During this time, however, they acquired a solid core of players such as catcher [[Ray Schalk]], shortstop / third baseman [[Buck Weaver]], and pitchers [[Eddie Cicotte]], [[Red Faber]] and [[Reb Russell]].\n\nApril 18, 1907, was the coldest [[Opening Day]] ever, when the temperature was {{convert|38|F-change|0}}.<ref name=\"Chicago Tribune\">{{cite news|title=Heading for White Sox opener?

Their offense, led by Collins (.289, 91 runs), Felsch (.308, 102 RBI) and Jackson (.301, 91 runs), was 1st in runs scored. The White Sox pitching staff, led by [[Eddie Cicotte]] (28\u201312 1.53 ERA), Williams (17\u20138 2.97 ERA), [[Red Faber]] (16\u201313 1.92 ERA) and [[Reb Russell]] (15\u20135 1.95 ERA), ranked first with a 2.16 ERA.\n\n====1917 World Series====\n{{main|1917 World Series}}\n\nThe White Sox faced the 98\u201356 [[1917 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] in the [[1917 World Series]]. The White Sox won Game one in Chicago 2\u20131 behind a complete game by Cicotte. Felsch hit a home run in the fourth inning that provided the winning margin. The White Sox beat the Giants in Game two by a score of 7\u20132 behind another complete game effort by Faber to take a 2\u20130 lead in the series.\n\nBack in New York for Game three, Cicotte again threw a complete game, but the White Sox could not muster a single run against Giants starter [[Rube Benton]] and lost 2\u20130. In Game 4 the White Sox were shut out again 5\u20130 by [[Ferdie Schupp]]. Faber threw another complete game, but the Series was going back to Chicago even at 2\u20132.\n\nReb Russell started Game 5 in Chicago, but only faced 3 batters before giving way to Cicotte. Going into the bottom of the seventh inning, Chicago was down 5\u20132, but they rallied to score three in the 7th and three in the 8th to win 8\u20135. Red Faber pitched the final two innings for the win. In Game six, the White Sox took an early 3\u20130 lead and on the strength of another complete game victory from Faber (his third of the Series) won 4\u20132 and clinched the world championship. Eddie Collins was the hitting hero, batting .409 over the six game series while Cicotte and Faber combined to pitch 50 out of a total 52 World Series innings to lead the staff.\n\n==1918\u20131920: The Black Sox==\n[[File:1919 Chicago White Sox.jpg|thumb|right|The 1919 Chicago White Sox]]\n\n{{main|1919 Chicago White Sox season}}\n\nAfter an off-year in the war-shortened season of [[1918 Major League Baseball season|1918]], the club bounced back to win the pennant in 1919 and entered the [[1919 World Series|World Series]] heavily favored to defeat the [[1919 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]] in a best-of-9.\n\nHowever, just before the Series, it became known that some big money was being bet on the Reds, fueling talk that the Series was [[match fixing|fixed]]. The White Sox lost to the Reds in eight games.\n\n===1920===\n{{main|1920 Chicago White Sox season}}\n\nRumors of a fix continued unabated through the [[1920 Major League Baseball season|1920]] campaign, even as the White Sox roared through the season and appeared well on their way to a third pennant in four years. The team's pitching was particularly strong that year; the 1920 White Sox pitching staff was the first in the majors to feature four 20-game winners.\n\n===Black Sox Scandal===\n{{main|Black Sox Scandal}}\n\nIn September 1920, an investigation into a fixed Cubs game eventually turned in the direction of the 1919 Series. During the investigation, Cicotte and Jackson confessed. Comiskey, who himself had turned a blind eye to the rumors, was compelled to suspend the remaining seven players (Gandil, eventually perceived as the ringleader, the one \"connected\" to the gamblers, had retired after the 1919 season) before their last season series against the [[1919 St. Louis Browns season|St. Louis Browns]]. The suspensions ground the team to a halt; they lost two out of three games to the Browns and finished second, two games behind the [[1920 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]]. However, the evidence of their involvement (signed confessions) disappeared from the [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]] courthouse. Lacking that tangible evidence, a criminal trial (whose scope was limited to the question of defrauding the public) ended in acquittals of all the players. Regardless, newly installed [[Commissioner of Baseball]] [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]] banned all the accused from baseball for life. He argued that even though the players had been acquitted, there was no dispute that they had broken the rules of baseball, and they could not ever be allowed to return if the game was to regain the trust of the public.\n\n==1922\u20131950: The lean years==\n[[File:TedLyonsGoudeycard.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Ted Lyons]]' 1933 [[Goudey]] baseball card.]]\nFrom 1901 to 1920, the White Sox won four out of a possible 19 pennants. However, they were severely crippled by the loss of seven of their best players in their prime. With a depleted roster, the [[1921 Chicago White Sox season|White Sox]] dropped into seventh place in {{MLBy|1921}} and would not contend again until {{MLBy|1936}}. During that stretch, only the {{MLBy|1925}} and {{MLBy|1926}} teams even managed to top .500. During this period, the White Sox featured stars such as third baseman [[Willie Kamm]], shortstop [[Luke Appling]], outfielder [[Leo Najo]] and pitcher [[Ted Lyons]]. However, an outstanding team was never developed around them, or a deep pitching staff. Ironically, the White Sox almost landed [[Babe Ruth]]; they offered to trade Jackson to the [[Boston Red Sox|Red Sox]] for Ruth after owner [[Harry Frazee]] put his troublemaking star on the market. The White Sox offered Jackson and $60,000; however, the [[New York Yankees]] offered an all-cash deal of $100,000. Between the dumping of star players by the [[History of the Philadelphia Athletics|Philadelphia Athletics]] and the Red Sox, and the decimation of the White Sox, a \"power vacuum\" was created in the American League, into which the Yankees would soon move.\n\nThe White Sox finally became competitive again under popular manager [[Jimmy Dykes]], who led them from 1934 to 1946&nbsp;\u2013 still the longest managerial tenure in team history. However, the White Sox did not completely recover from their malaise until the team was rebuilt in the 1950s under managers [[Paul Richards (baseball)|Paul Richards]], [[Marty Marion]], and [[Al L\u00f3pez]].\n\n==1950\u20131967: The Go-Go Era==\nFollowing Charles Comiskey's death in 1931, the team continued to be operated by his family&nbsp;\u2013 first by his son [[J. Louis Comiskey|Lou]], then by Louis' widow [[Grace Comiskey|Grace]], and finally by their daughter [[Dorothy Comiskey Rigney|Dorothy Rigney]]. Not until {{MLBy|1959}} did the team pass out of the family (thanks in part to a feud between Dorothy and her brother [[Chuck Comiskey|Chuck]]) to a new ownership group, led by [[Bill Veeck]], who had run the [[Cleveland Indians]] and the [[History of the St. Louis Browns|St. Louis Browns]].\n\nDuring the 1950s, the team had begun to restore its respectability with manager [[Paul Richards (baseball)|Paul Richards]] utilizing an offensive philosophy emphasizing speed and a spectacular style of defense.<ref name=\"A Fond Farewell To A Baseball Man Who Wasn't Afraid To Take Chances\">[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1065155/index.htm ''A Fond Farewell To A Baseball Man Who Wasn't Afraid To Take Chances'', by Henry Hecht, Sports Illustrated, August 25, 1986]</ref> Perennial All-Star [[Minnie Mi\u00f1oso]], a former Negro Leaguer who became the White Sox' first black player in {{MLBy|1951}}, personified both aspects, leading the league in stolen bases while hitting over .300 and providing terrific play in left field. The additions of rookie shortstop [[Luis Aparicio]] in 1956 and manager [[Al L\u00f3pez]] in 1957 continued the strengthening of the team, joining longtime team standouts such as [[Nellie Fox]] at second base, pitchers [[Billy Pierce]] and [[Virgil Trucks]], and catcher [[Sherm Lollar]]. The White Sox would lead the American League in stolen bases every year from {{MLBy|1951}} to {{MLBy|1961}}.\n\nAlthough the White Sox had winning records every season from 1951 through 1967, the Yankees dynasty of the era often left the White Sox frustrated in second place; they were league runner-up five times between 1957 and 1965. Health problems forced Veeck to sell the team to brothers [[Arthur Allyn, Jr.|Arthur]] and [[John Allyn]] in {{MLBy|1961}}, and while the team continued to play well, many of the ballpark thrills seemed to be missing. The White Sox had several outstanding pitching staffs in the 1960s, with pitchers who had the best ERA in four different seasons -- [[Frank Baumann (baseball)|Frank Baumann]], 2.67 ({{MLBy|1960}}), [[Gary Peters (baseball)|Gary Peters]], 2.33 ({{MLBy|1963}}), and again with 1.98 ({{MLBy|1966}}) and finally [[Joe Horlen]], 2.06 ({{MLBy|1967}}).\n\n===1959===\n{{Main|1959 Chicago White Sox season}}\n\nIn [[1959 Major League Baseball season|1959]], the team won its first pennant in 40 years, thanks to the efforts of several eventual Hall of Famers&nbsp;\u2013 Lopez, Aparicio, Fox (the league MVP), and pitcher [[Early Wynn]], who won the [[Cy Young Award]] at a time when only one award was presented for both leagues. The White Sox would also acquire slugger [[Ted Kluszewski]], a local area native, from the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] for the final pennant push. Kluszewski gave the team a much-needed slugger for the stretch run, and he hit nearly .300 for the White Sox in the final month. Lopez had also managed the [[1954 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]] to the [[1954 World Series|World Series]] in [[1954 Major League Baseball season|1954]], making him the only manager to interrupt the New York Yankees pennant run between 1949 and 1964 inclusive.\n\n====1959 World Series====\n{{main|1959 World Series}}\n\nAfter the pennant-clinching victory, Chicago Mayor [[Richard J. Daley]], a lifelong White Sox fan, ordered his fire chief to set off the city's [[civil defense siren|air raid sirens]]. Many Chicagoans became fearful and confused since 1959 was the height of the [[Cold War]]; however, they relaxed somewhat upon realizing it was part of the White Sox' celebration. The White Sox won Game 1 of the World Series 11\u20130 on the strength of Kluszewski's two home runs, their last postseason home win until [[2005 American League Division Series|2005]]. The [[1959 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]], however, won three of the next four games and captured their first World Series championship since moving to the west coast in 1958. 92,706 fans witnessed Game 5 of the World Series at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]], the most ever to attend a World Series game, or for that matter any non-exhibition major league baseball game. The White Sox won that game 1\u20130 over the Dodgers' 23-year-old pitcher [[Sandy Koufax]], but the Dodgers clinched the series by beating the White Sox 9\u20133 two days later at Comiskey Park.\n\n===Veeck ownership===\nDue to Veeck's arrival in 1959, Comiskey Park instantly became a ballpark filled with a series of promotional stunts which helped draw record crowds, the most obvious being the exploding [[fireworks]] Veeck installed in the scoreboard to celebrate home runs and victories.  And in 1960, they became the first team in the history of sports to wear last names on the back of their jerseys, a Veeck innovation.  Unlike Charles Comiskey, Veeck was considered a player-friendly owner, and players enjoyed playing for him.\n\n===1964===\n{{main|1964 Chicago White Sox season}}\n\nThe {{MLBy|1964}} season was especially frustrating, as the team won 98 games, four more than 1959, including their last nine in a row&nbsp;\u2013 yet finished one game behind the pennant-winning [[1964 New York Yankees season|Yankees]], who had a late-season 11-game win streak that opened up just enough room to stave off the White Sox's final charge.\n\n===1967===\n{{main|1967 Chicago White Sox season}}\n\nThe White Sox were also involved in one of the closest pennant races in history in [[1967 Major League Baseball season|1967]]. After leading the American League for most of the season, on the final weekend, the White Sox, [[1967 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]], [[1967 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]] and [[1967 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]] all had a shot at the pennant. However, the Red Sox would assert themselves in the final weekend, beating the Twins to take the pennant by a single game. The White Sox finished in fourth place at 89\u201373, three games behind.\n\n==1968\u20131975: Threats of relocation==\nIn {{baseball year|1968}}, [[Bud Selig]], a former minority owner of the [[Milwaukee Braves (1953\u201365)|Milwaukee Braves]] who had been unable to stop the relocation of his team three years earlier, contracted with the Allyn brothers to host nine home games (one against each of the other American League clubs) at [[Milwaukee County Stadium]] as part of an attempt to attract an expansion franchise to [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]].\n\nThe experiment was staggeringly successful&nbsp;\u2014 those nine games drew 264,297 fans. In Chicago that season, the [[1968 Chicago White Sox season|White Sox]] drew 539,478 fans to their remaining 58 home dates (72 games, 14 doubleheaders). In just a handful of games, the Milwaukee crowds accounted for nearly one-third of the total attendance at White Sox games.\n\nIn {{MLBy|1969}}, the league expanded from 10 teams to 12, and the [[1969 Chicago White Sox season|White Sox]] schedule in Milwaukee was likewise expanded to include 11 home games (again, one against every opponent). Although those games were attended by slightly fewer fans (198,211 fans, for an average of 18,019) they represented a greater percentage of the total White Sox attendance than the previous year&nbsp;\u2014 over one-third of the fans who went to White Sox games did so at Milwaukee County Stadium. In the remaining 59 home dates in Chicago (70 games, 11 doubleheaders), the White Sox drew 391,335 for an average of 6,632 per date.\n\nSelig was denied an expansion franchise at the [[1968 Major League Baseball expansion draft|1968 owners' meetings]], and turned his efforts toward purchasing and relocating an existing club. His search began close to home with the White Sox themselves. According to Selig, he had a handshake agreement with [[Arthur Allyn]] in early 1969 to purchase a majority stake in the White Sox and move them north to Milwaukee. The American League, however, blocked the sale, unwilling to cede what was then the nation's second largest city to the National League and the Cubs. Arthur Allyn instead sold his shares to his brother John, who agreed to stay in Chicago. Selig would go on to buy the [[Milwaukee Brewers|Seattle Pilots]] and move them to Milwaukee instead. John Allyn renamed Comiskey Park \"White Sox Park\" and installed [[artificial turf]] (\"Sox Sod\") in the infield (the outfield remained natural grass).\n\nThe 1970 White Sox hit rock bottom for the franchise in the post-World War II era, going a Major League worst 56-106, nine games worse than the second-year [[Milwaukee Brewers]], and seven worse than another 1969 expansion team, the [[San Diego Padres]].\n\nThe [[1972 Chicago White Sox season|White Sox]] had a brief resurgence in {{MLBy|1972}}, with slugger [[Dick Allen]] winning the MVP award; but injuries, especially to popular third baseman [[Bill Melton]], took their toll and the team finished 5\u00bd games behind [[1972 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland]], the eventual world champion.\n\nSeveral lawsuits against Major League Baseball from Seattle over the move of the Pilots to Milwaukee almost resulted in the White Sox being moved to the Emerald City in {{MLBy|1975}}. An elaborate scheme for a franchise shuffle soon came to light. The White Sox were to be moved to Seattle, then the [[Oakland Athletics]] were to take the White Sox's place in Comiskey Park. Oakland owner [[Charlie Finley]] was from nearby [[La Porte, Indiana]]. His A's had not drawn well during their Championship years in [[Oakland, California]], and he wanted to bring them to Chicago. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} However, the shuffle collapsed when owner [[John Allyn]] sold the team to the physically rehabilitated Bill Veeck. In {{MLBy|1977}}, the [[Seattle Mariners]] were created, thus restoring the major leagues' presence in the [[Pacific Northwest]].\n\n==1976\u20131981: The Return of Veeck and the South Side Hitmen==\nOn December 10, {{MLBy|1975}}, [[Bill Veeck]] regained ownership of the team, and he vowed to make the White Sox an exciting team again. Besides his customary promotions, Veeck introduced retro uniforms and shorts. The shorts were only worn three times.  The first time was during the initial game of a doubleheader against the [[1976 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]] at Comiskey Park on August 8, 1976, followed by appearances on August 21 and August 22.<ref>[http://www.freewebs.com/karamaxjoe/thewhitesoxshorts.htm The White Sox Shorts'The Ugly History']</ref> The {{MLBy|1976}} team was one of the worst White Sox teams ever, winning only 64 games (.398), drawing fewer than 915,000 fans.\n\nVeeck's strategy to make the team competitive quickly, dubbed \"rent-a-player\" by sports writers, involved acquiring star players entering the final year of their contracts. The theory was that the players would strive to put up huge numbers in hopes of getting a big contract at the end of the season, and carry the club with them. The first of these acquisitions was made prior to the [[1977 Major League Baseball season|1977 season]] and the last prior to the [[1978 Major League Baseball season|1978 season]]. While this approach had the virtue of not having been tried, it was unsustainable. The Sox had to give up several young prospects in exchange for veteran players who invariably signed with other clubs after their single season in Chicago.\n\nDuring this period the Sox acquired several players who were once stars but were past their primes. One was [[Don Kessinger]], a shortstop who had his best years with the crosstown [[Chicago Cubs|Cubs]]. Kessinger served as a [[Player-coach|player-manager]] in [[1979 Major League Baseball season|1979]]. Another was outfielder [[Ralph Garr]], who had his best seasons with the [[Atlanta Braves]]. A once-notable pitcher was [[Blue Moon Odom|John \"Blue Moon\" Odom]], a former [[Oakland Athletics]] star. On July 28, 1976, Odom combined with [[Francisco Barrios]] on a no-hitter against [[1976 Major League Baseball season|Oakland]], which proved to be Odom's last major league victory. The Sox also brought in [[Clay Carroll]], a right-handed relief pitcher who was a key member of the [[Cincinnati Reds]] championship teams in the mid-1970s.\n\nUnlike most of his fellow owners, Veeck had no income apart from the White Sox. More or less out of necessity, Veeck looked for any edge he could find. The club held open tryouts during spring training in [[1978 Major League Baseball season|1978]]. They looked at pretty much anyone who showed up. Each player's name was sewn on his uniform, ostensibly to prove that the tryouts were legitimate and not just a stunt. This approach was the subject of an article in ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''. The spring training tryout became a White Sox tradition that continues to this day.<ref>[http://mlb.mlb.com/cws/ballpark/cws_ballpark_guide_dir.jsp#t MLB.com]</ref>\n\n===1977===\n{{main|1977 Chicago White Sox season}}\n\nThe [[1977 Major League Baseball season|1977 season]] was a memorable one for the South Siders, led by off-season acquisitions [[Oscar Gamble]] (.297 AVG, 31 HR, 83 RBI), [[Richie Zisk]] (.290 AVG, 30 HR, 101 RBI) and American League Comeback Player of the Year [[Eric Soderholm]] (.280 AVG, 25 HR, 67 RBI). The team, known by the press and fans as the \"South Side Hitmen\" hit a since-broken team record 192 home runs and were in first place in the American League West as late as August en route to a third-place finish (90\u201372). They also drew a team-record 1,657,135 fans to Comiskey (since broken as well). Manager [[Bob Lemon]] was named AL Manager of the Year by [[United Press International|UPI]] for his efforts.<ref>[http://whitesoxinteractive.com/History&Glory/1977.htm Whitesoxinteractive.com]</ref>\n\n===1978===\n{{main|1978 Chicago White Sox season}}\n\nAfter the 1977 season Gamble and Zisk signed with other teams&nbsp;\u2014 Gamble with the [[San Diego Padres]] and Zisk with the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]. Veeck's attempt to replace them with [[Bobby Bonds]] and [[Ron Blomberg]] fizzled as the [[1978 Major League Baseball season|1978]] team lost 90 games. Bonds appeared in only 26 games for the Sox before being dealt to the Texas Rangers, and Blomberg's major league career ended with the season's final game.\n\n===1979\u20131981===\nTwo tough years followed: 87 losses in {{MLBy|1979}} (including the infamous July 12 forfeit on [[Disco Demolition Night]]) and 90 losses in {{MLBy|1980}}.\n\nVeeck began building a farm system that produced several noteworthy players including [[Harold Baines]] and [[Britt Burns]]. But Veeck could not compete in the free agent market or afford what he called \"the high price of mediocrity.\" By 1980, the White Sox were looking for new ownership. Veeck favored Ohio real estate tycoon [[Edward J. DeBartolo, Sr.]], whose family owned the NFL's [[San Francisco 49ers]] and the NHL's [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] and had tried to buy several MLB teams and move them to [[New Orleans]]. DeBartolo pleaded to be allowed to buy the White Sox and he promised to keep the team in Chicago. Baseball commissioner [[Bowie Kuhn]] blocked the deal, because he thought DeBartolo would be bad for baseball.\n\n==1982\u20132004: The early Reinsdorf era==\nInstead, Veeck sold the team to an ownership group headed by accountant [[Jerry Reinsdorf]] and television producer [[Eddie Einhorn]]. The new owners moved quickly to show that they were committed to winning by signing All-Star catcher [[Carlton Fisk]] from the Red Sox as well as power-hitting outfielder [[Greg Luzinski]] from the defending champion Phillies during the 1980\u201381 offseason. They also retained the club's young, relatively unknown manager, [[Tony La Russa]].\n\n===1983: \"Winning Ugly\"===\n[[File:Harold baines2001.jpg|thumb|right|[[Harold Baines]], one of the White Sox's franchise players throughout the 1980s, became one of the organization's all-time top hitting leaders during his 14 seasons in Chicago]]\n{{Main|1983 Chicago White Sox season}}\n\nIn [[1983 Major League Baseball season|1983]], the White Sox enjoyed their best success in a generation. After a mediocre first half, the White Sox decided that they needed speed at the top of the lineup. The Sox traded second baseman [[Tony Bernazard]] to the Mariners for [[Julio Cruz (baseball)|Julio Cruz]]. With Cruz's speed, they went 60\u201325 to close out the season, clinching the AL West title, which earned Manager [[Tony La Russa]] his first Manager of the Year award.\n\n[[Doug Rader]], then-manager of the Texas Rangers, derisively accused the team of \"winning ugly\" for their style of play, which reflected a tendency to win games through scrappy play rather than strong hitting or pitching. Rader also thought that if the White Sox played in the Eastern Division, they would finish fifth behind powerhouses such as [[1983 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore]], [[1983 New York Yankees season|New York]], and [[1983 Milwaukee Brewers season|Milwaukee]]. Chicago media and White Sox fans picked up on the phrase, and turned \"Winning Ugly\" into the team slogan. While they had a great run in the regular season, they were not able to carry that over into the postseason as they lost to a powerful Baltimore Orioles team three games to one in the [[1983 American League Championship Series|AL Championship Series]]. [[LaMarr Hoyt]] led the White Sox to a 2\u20131 victory in Game 1, but the Orioles clinched the series with a 3\u20130 ten-inning victory in Game 4. White Sox pitcher Burns pitched a \"gutsy\" game, throwing 9\u2153 shutout innings before a home run by [[Tito Landrum]] broke up the game and the hearts of the South Side faithful.\n\n===1985\u20131989===\nThe club slid back into mediocrity for the rest of the 1980s, contending only in [[1985 Major League Baseball season|1985]]. Before the 1985 season began, the White Sox traded pitcher [[LaMarr Hoyt]] to the [[San Diego Padres]] in exchange for flashy shortstop [[Ozzie Guill\u00e9n]]. Guillen would win the AL Rookie of the Year award. In 1986, broadcaster-turned-general manager [[Ken Harrelson|Ken \"Hawk\" Harrelson]] fired La Russa after a poor start. The club wouldn't contend again until 1990, the final year in [[Comiskey Park]].\n\n===1990s: \"Good Guys Wear Black\"===\n\n====1990====\n{{Main|1990 Chicago White Sox season}}\n[[File:Old comiskey park.jpg|thumb|right|The Chicago White Sox hosting a home game at Comiskey Park in 1990]]\nThat season, most of their young talent blossomed. Closer [[Bobby Thigpen]] established a then record of 57 saves. In addition to that, first baseman [[Frank Thomas (designated hitter)|Frank Thomas]], pitchers [[Alex Fernandez (baseball)|Alex Fernandez]] and [[Jack McDowell]], and third baseman [[Robin Ventura]] would make their presences felt on the South Side. The White Sox of {{baseball year|1990}} won 94 games, but finished 9 games behind the powerful [[1990 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]].\n\nOn July 11, as part of the celebration of Comiskey Park, the White Sox played a Turn Back the Clock game against the [[1990 Milwaukee Brewers season|Milwaukee Brewers]]; the Brewers won 12\u20139 in 13 innings after posting a 6-run rally in the 8th inning to tie the game. The White Sox wore their 1917 home uniforms. This was the first Turn Back the Clock game in the major leagues and started what has become a popular promotion. New Comiskey Park opened in 1991, and was completed at a cost of $167 million.\n\n====1993====\n{{Main|1993 Chicago White Sox season}}\n\nThe team reached the [[1993 American League Championship Series|ALCS]] in {{baseball year|1993}}. The White Sox were led by Thomas, Ventura, multi-sport star [[Bo Jackson]], Cy Young Award winner McDowell and All-Star closer [[Roberto Hern\u00e1ndez (relief pitcher)|Roberto Hern\u00e1ndez]] and won the last AL West before realignment with a 94\u201368 record. However, the White Sox were a big disappointment in the [[1993 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], losing to the defending World Champion [[1993 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]] in six games. The Jays would go on to win the [[1993 World Series|World Series]] again in 1993.\n\n====1994====\n{{Main|1994 Chicago White Sox season}}\n\nThe White Sox led the new [[American League Central]] at the time of the [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|1994 players' strike]].\n\n====1995-1999====\n\nAlthough struggling in the 1995 season, the Sox maintained some consistency through the rest of the 1990s, managing to finish in second place every year after, including 1997, the year of the notorious [[White Flag Trade]]. Although maligned by fans at the time, the move would ultimately help the team out later.\n\n===2000\u20132004===\n\n====2000: The Kids Can Play====\n{{Main|2000 Chicago White Sox season}}\n\nUnder Manager [[Jerry Manuel]], the White Sox fielded a talented but chronically under-achieving team. In {{baseball year|2000}}, however, the White Sox had one of their best teams since the 1983 club. This team, whose slogan was \"The Kids Can Play\", won 95 games en route to an AL Central division title. The team scored runs at a blistering pace, which enabled them to overcome the effects of a mediocre pitching staff, led by [[Mike Sirotka]] and [[James Baldwin (baseball)|James Baldwin]]. Frank Thomas nearly won his third MVP award with his offensive output; he was helped by good offensive years from [[Magglio Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez]], [[Paul Konerko]], [[Carlos Lee]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Valent\u00edn]].\n\nAs in 1983 and 1993, the 2000 team could not carry its success over into the postseason, getting swept by the wild-card [[2000 Seattle Mariners season|Seattle Mariners]] in the [[2000 American League Division Series|Division Series]]. Despite new club records for hits (1,615), runs scored (978), RBI (926), home runs (216), and doubles (325), the White Sox hit only .185 in the ALDS and failed to score a run after the third inning in any of the three games.\n\n====2003-04====\n{{Main|2003 Chicago White Sox season}}\n\nIn [[2003 Major League Baseball season|2003]], Comiskey Park was renamed after cell phone company [[U.S. Cellular]] bought the naming rights at $68 million over 20 years, a very unpopular move among fans. In 2003 The All Star game was held for the first time at their new park. Although briefly leading the central in September (the first time since 1906 both Chicago teams were in First at the same time), the Sox ultimately finished four games behind the Twins.\n\nIn 2004, the team named [[Ozzie Guillen]] as the 37th manager in team history. Although again finishing in second place, losing streaks in August and September, along with various injuries, sunk the team. Several changes were made in the offseason, including trading [[Carlos Lee]] to the Brewers for [[Scott Podsednik]]. Although [[Magglio Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez]] was nearly traded to the Red Sox for [[Nomar Garciaparra]], the deal fell through and Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez left as a free agent to sign with the Tigers.\n\n==2005: The drought ends==\n[[File:Ozzie Guill\u00e9n.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ozzie Guill\u00e9n]] not only made a name for himself as a solid defensive shortstop with the White Sox in the 1980s-90s, but also as the team's manager from 2004\u20132011 where he led the franchise to a World Series title]]\n{{Main|2005 Chicago White Sox season}}\n\nThe changes made an immediate impact on the team. In {{baseball year|2005}}, the White Sox posted the best record in the major leagues for much of the year, before a late season slump saw the [[2005 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] overtake them (100 wins vs. 99 wins). Though a serious challenge for their dominance of the division was mounted late in the year by the [[2005 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]] (the Tribe actually reduced what was once a 15-game lead for the White Sox down to 1\u00bd games at one point only to lose the last 7 games), Chicago scored a 4\u20132 victory over the [[2005 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]] on September 29 to win their first AL Central Division title since 2000. Finishing at 99\u201363 (.611) tied their 1983 record, and won the division by six games. The last time they had a higher percentage than that was 1920, when they finished second in the league thanks to the late-season \"Black Sox\" suspensions. The combination of the league's best record with the American League victory in the All-Star Game gave the White Sox the home field advantage throughout the 2005 postseason (perhaps unnecessary as the White Sox won every post-season road game they played in 2005).\n\n===2005 ALDS===\nIn the [[2005 American League Division Series]], the White Sox took on the [[2005 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]], the 2005 AL [[Major League Baseball wild card|wild-card]] winners and the defending World Series champions. The White Sox defeated the Red Sox in a three-game sweep. They won the first two games (scoring a 14\u20132 victory in the first game&nbsp;\u2013 their first postseason win at home since [[1959 World Series|1959]]&nbsp;\u2013 and 5\u20134 in the second) of the series at home before claiming a 5\u20133 victory at [[Fenway Park]] in Boston. Scott Podsednik hit his first home run of the season in the first game of the series.\n\nThe ALDS also set the tone for what would be an unusually suspenseful post-season; while their first game was considered a blow-out, the remaining games saw the White Sox making the most of rare opportunities and hanging on to narrow leads. In the first inning of game 1, the White Sox put up 5 runs, and never looked back. A late inning three-run home run by [[Scott Podsednik]] \u2013 his first home run of the season, was the icing on the cake in the game 1 blowout. In Game 2, the White Sox were actually down 4\u20132 when Red Sox second baseman [[Tony Graffanino]], formerly playing for the White Sox, let [[Juan Uribe]]'s potential inning-ending, double-play grounder go through his legs; one out later, [[Tadahito Iguchi]] hit a three-run homer to left that clinched the game for the White Sox. In Game 3, [[Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez]] entered the game with the bases loaded and nobody out with the White Sox ahead by only one run in the bottom of the sixth inning. Based on their regular season performance, it was later calculated that the Red Sox's probability of winning at that point was .662, even though they were trailing by one run. Instead, the first two batters, [[Jason Varitek]] and [[Tony Graffanino]], both popped out, and [[Johnny Damon]] struck out swinging on a breaking ball. Hernandez went on to retire six of the next seven batters, and the White Sox's rookie reliever [[Bobby Jenks]] closed out the game.\n\n===2005 ALCS===\nThe White Sox then moved on to face the [[2005 Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim season|Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]] in the [[2005 American League Championship Series|ALCS]]. The Angels won Game 1, 3\u20132, The White Sox only post-season loss.\n\nIn Game 2 on October 12, the teams were involved in one of the most controversial endings in baseball playoff history. With the score tied 1\u20131 with two outs in the bottom of the ninth, A. J. Pierzynski apparently struck out to end the inning. At first Pierzynski headed back to the dugout but ran to first base upon realizing that umpire [[Doug Eddings]] had ruled that Angels catcher [[Josh Paul]] (a former White Sox player) did not field the ball cleanly, meaning he would have to either tag the batter or throw to the first baseman to record the out (see [[uncaught third strike]]). Despite vehement protests from various members of the Angels, including manager [[Mike Scioscia]], Pierzynski was awarded first base. Pinch-runner [[Pablo Ozuna]] replaced Pierzynski and stole second base. Third baseman [[Joe Crede]] then delivered a double on the third pitch to give the White Sox a 2\u20131 win. Overshadowed by that play was the 1-run, 5-hit complete game pitched by [[Mark Buehrle]]. Buehrle's excellent effort allowed the White Sox to capture their first-ever home victory in ALCS history.\n\nBuoyed by their win, the White Sox traveled to Anaheim, California, where starters [[Jon Garland]], [[Freddy Garc\u00eda]], and [[Jos\u00e9 Contreras]] (who had dropped Game 1 to the Angels in Chicago) pitched three more complete game victories consecutively over the Angels, giving the White Sox their first American League pennant since 1959. White Sox slugger [[Paul Konerko]] was named the ALCS MVP, on the strength of his two home runs, 7 RBI, and .286 average.\n\nEspecially in light of the evolution of the game, the White Sox four straight complete games was considered an unbelievable achievement. In fact, since Jos\u00e9 Contreras pitched 8\u2153 innings in game 1, the White Sox bullpen saw a total of \u2154 of an inning pitched (by [[Neal Cotts]]) in the entire series. The last time four consecutive complete games had been pitched in a championship series was in the [[1956 World Series]] between the [[1956 Brooklyn Dodgers season|Brooklyn Dodgers]] and [[1928 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]], and the [[1928 World Series|1928 Yankees]] were the last team to win four consecutive complete games in a championship series. In fact, the last time any major league pitching staff had hurled four straight complete game victories was near the end of the [[1983 Major League Baseball season|1983 regular season]], when the [[1983 Texas Rangers season|Texas Rangers]] accomplished the feat.\n\n===2005 World Series===\nThe White Sox now advanced to the [[2005 World Series|World Series]], where they would take on the National League champion [[2005 Houston Astros season|Houston Astros]]. The White Sox' appearance in the World Series was bittersweet for longtime franchise star [[Frank Thomas (designated hitter)|Frank Thomas]]. One of the most popular and productive players in the franchise's long history, Thomas would finally be going to a World Series in his 16th major league season. However, due to injury, Thomas would be unable to participate except as an observer, and his contributions to the White Sox in 2005 were limited.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:WhiteSoxChampionsPlaza2.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Champions Plaza, U.S. Cellular Field \u2013 Chicago]] -->\n[[File:Chicago3 SvG.jpg|right|thumb|Chicago skyline during the World Series supporting the White Sox]]\nGame 1 saw Astros' ace [[Roger Clemens]] leave the game with a hamstring injury, leaving [[Jos\u00e9 Contreras]] to finish up the Astros and Chicago took advantage of its opponents' weakness, winning 5\u20133. [[Joe Crede]] especially made an impressive showing with his stellar defensive plays at third base.\n\nGame 2 of the Series, as in the ALCS, saw the White Sox again involved in a controversial play. With the White Sox down 4\u20132 in the seventh with two outs and two runners on base, the home plate umpire ruled that [[Jermaine Dye]] had been hit by a pitch, while the Astros argued (and TV replays confirmed) that the ball had actually hit the bat. Dye was given a free pass to first, and the next batter, Paul Konerko, launched a grand slam into left field to give Chicago a 6\u20134 lead. Houston tied the game on a two-run single with two outs in the top of the ninth, but in the bottom of the ninth, [[Scott Podsednik]] hit a walk-off solo home run off [[Brad Lidge]] to give the White Sox a thrilling 7\u20136 victory and a 2\u20130 lead in the Series. Podsednik was the first player in major league history to hit a home run in the World Series after not having hit any during the regular season. (He did, however, have a home run in Game 1 of the ALDS against Boston, making the World Series home run his second of the playoffs.)\n\nThe World Series then shifted to Houston for Game 3, in which Astros' starter and NLCS MVP [[Roy Oswalt]] cruised with a 4\u20130 lead until the wheels totally came off for him with a five-run fifth by the White Sox. The Astros managed to tie the game in the eighth, but repeatedly blew scoring opportunities in the next few innings. Finally, in the top of the 14th, former Astro [[Geoff Blum]] hit a tie-breaking home run; the White Sox took a commanding 3\u20130 Series lead with a 7\u20135 victory in the longest World Series game in history (in terms of time; tied for most innings). [[Ozzie Guill\u00e9n]] sent [[Mark Buehrle]] in to get the last out in the bottom of the 14th to get the save after he had started Game 2, and later remarked that he was set to send [[Pablo Ozuna]] (a position player) in to pitch if the Astros somehow extended the game.\n\nGame 4 was a pitcher's duel between [[Freddy Garc\u00eda]] and [[Brandon Backe]]. The game was scoreless until [[Jermaine Dye]] singled to center off of Brad Lidge, driving in [[Willie Harris]] for what turned out to be the winning run. This was the second game of the series in which Lidge had given up the game-winning run (Podesednik's home run in Game 2). Game 4 also saw a spectacular defensive play by [[Juan Uribe]], as the Chicago shortstop fell two rows into the stands in order to retire [[Chris Burke (baseball)|Chris Burke]] for the second out in the bottom of the ninth. Uribe also earned the assist in the final out of the Series on the next play, as he narrowly threw [[Orlando Palmeiro]] out at first to give the White Sox their first World Series crown since [[1917 World Series|1917]].\n\n{{quote|A grounder up the middle, past [[Bobby Jenks|Jenks]], Uribe has it, he throws- OUT!

Their 11\u20131 postseason record was tied with [[1999 New York Yankees season|1999 Yankees]] as the best single post season mark. (Only [[1976 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]] in [[1976 Major League Baseball season|1976]] had a better winning percentage by going 7\u20130.) Also, their 8-game winning streak (the four wins over the Angels and the sweep against the Astros) is tied with the Boston Red Sox (who won 8 games in a row en route to their 2004 World Series championship) for the longest postseason winning streak in Major League history. The White Sox also became the first team to win all three post-season victories on the road. Amazingly, despite their 105-year history, this was only the franchise's third World Series championship, (following victories in 1917 and 1906). It also marked their first pennant since the advent of divisional play in 1969 (the White Sox won the inaugural American League pennant in 1901, but this was 2 years prior to the first modern World Series).\n\n==2006\u2013present: Post-World Series==\n\n===2006 season===\n[[File:Jim Thome 2008.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jim Thome]]]]\n{{Main|2006 Chicago White Sox season}}\n\nAfter leading the wild card race for much of the season, the White Sox faltered, losing 15 of 24 at the beginning of September to eliminate them from playoff contention, ending their chances of becoming the first repeat winner of the World Series since the New York Yankees in 1999 and 2000. They nonetheless finished with a 90\u201372 record, the season's best record by a non-playoff team.\n\nThis was the first year a White Sox manager had led the AL All-Star squad since 1994, when Gene Lamont led the team. In addition to manager Ozzie Guill\u00e9n, the White Sox had six representatives at the [[2006 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|77th All-Star Game]] at [[PNC Park]] in [[Pittsburgh]], the most among any club: starting pitcher [[Mark Buehrle]], closer [[Bobby Jenks]], catcher [[A. J. Pierzynski]], first basemen [[Paul Konerko]] and [[Jim Thome]], and right fielder [[Jermaine Dye]]. [[Jos\u00e9 Contreras]] was originally selected to pitch in the All-Star Game, but was replaced by [[Francisco Liriano]]. Guillen removed Contreras from the roster after a 117-pitch performance in a 19-inning game against Boston on the last day before the All-Star Break.\n\nPierzynski was the last White Sox to be named to the team after winning the year's [[All-Star Final Vote|Final Vote]], in which the fans select the 32nd and final player on both the AL and NL squads. Pierzynski is the second White Sox to be selected, following [[Scott Podsednik]]'s nomination in 2005. Dye competed in the 2006 CENTURY 21 [[Home Run Derby]]; he managed to hit 7 home runs in the first round, but [[David Ortiz]] and [[Ryan Howard]] both surpassed that total to knock Dye out of the competition.\n\nThe White Sox drew 2,957,414 fans for an average of 36,511, third in the AL. There were a total of 52 sellouts, breaking the previous team record of 18. The White Sox also drew 75 crowds in excess of 30,000, another franchise record.\n\n===2007 season===\n{{Main|2007 Chicago White Sox season}}\n\nOn April 18, Buehrle pitched a [[no-hitter]] against the [[2007 Texas Rangers season|Texas Rangers]], 6\u20130. Buehrle's only blemish was a walk to [[Sammy Sosa]] in the fifth, but Buehrle would promptly pick Sosa off during the next at-bat. Buehrle secured his spot in the MLB record books when he forced Rangers catcher [[Gerald Laird]] to ground out to third baseman [[Joe Crede]] at 9:14 P.M. CDT, sending the crowd of 25,390 at [[U.S. Cellular Field]] into a frenzy. He would face the minimum of 27 batters using 106 pitches (66 strikes), with the one walk to Sosa and eight strikeouts. [[Jermaine Dye]] hit a [[grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] and [[Jim Thome]] added two solo homers in the history-making night.\n\nOn July 6, the White Sox announced the signing of Mark Buehrle to a contract extension worth $56 million over four years. The move came after weeks of rumors of Buehrle possibly being traded.\n\nOverall, the White Sox season was hampered by injuries and a team-wide hitting slump. However, the season was not a complete failure with Mark Buehrle's no hitter, Jim Thome's 500th home run, and closer [[Bobby Jenks]] 41 consecutive batters retired (tying Jim Barr's all-time record and breaking the American League record.) Jenks would later fall short of the all-time record when Kansas City Royal's player [[Joey Gathright]] slapped a ground ball into left field just out of the reaches of third baseman [[Josh Fields (infielder)|Josh Fields]] and shortstop [[Juan Uribe]].\n\nThe White Sox finished the season fourth in their division with a 72\u201390 record, behind the [[2007 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]], [[2007 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]], and [[2007 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]].\n\n===2008 Season: Central champs again and a \"blackout game\"===\n{{Main|2008 Chicago White Sox season}}\n\nOn July 31, the day of the trade deadline, the White Sox traded relief pitcher [[Nick Masset]] and minor leaguer 2nd Baseman [[Danny Richar]] for [[Ken Griffey, Jr.]] of the [[Cincinnati Reds]].<ref>[http://www.local12.com/content/breaking_news/story.aspx?content_id=b91cb11a-b7f2-4c06-a821-3a0ede26aa07 Local112.com]{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nOn August 14, [[Jim Thome]], [[Paul Konerko]], [[Alexei Ram\u00edrez]], and [[Juan Uribe]] combined to hit four consecutive home runs, something that has only been done six other times in the history of [[Major League Baseball]].\n\nOn September 29, 2008, Ramirez hit his fourth grand slam of the season, setting a major-league single-season record for a rookie, off of Detroit Tigers pitcher Gary Glover in an 8\u20132 White Sox victory to qualify the [[2008 Chicago White Sox season|White Sox]] for a [[2008 American League Central tie-breaker game|one-game playoff]] against the [[2008 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]] for the AL Central title.

[[John Danks]] pitched on only three days rest and threw 103 pitches for 2 hits and no runs in eight innings.  [[Bobby Jenks]] would close the game with a perfect 9th. The only run of the game came from a [[Jim Thome]] home run, the 541st of his career.  This was the lowest scoring tiebreaker game in MLB history.  The White Sox are also the only team in MLB history to beat three different teams on three consecutive days: the [[2008 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]], [[2008 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]], and [[2008 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]].

In the first game he must seek out the six Books of Ys. These books contain the history of the ancient, vanished land of Ys, and will give him the knowledge he needs to defeat the evil forces currently sweeping the land of Esteria.\n\nIn ''Ys II'' Adol is transported to the [[Floating island (fiction)|floating]] civilization of Ys, and begins a quest to unravel the secrets of the land, and finally rid it and Esteria of evil. All English translations of ''Ys II'' were part of a compilation; no standalone version has been localized (except for iOS and Android ports).\n\n==Plot==\n{{long plot|section|date=December 2016}}\n\n===''Ys I''===\n''Ys I'' begins with a cutscene showing the main character, Adol Christin, gazing out to sea at the Stormwall which appeared around the island Esteria six months ago. Determined to investigate the situation, Adol sets off towards Esteria on a small boat; however, it is sunk by the storm and Adol washes up on the shore of Esteria. He is saved by a villager named Slaff from the port town of Barbado. Adol recuperates in the home of Barbado's doctor and learns that Slaff is both the doctor's son and the head of the town's militia. The militia was formed when demons and monsters appeared on the island, at the same time as when the Stormwall formed. The Stormwall cut Esteria off from the rest of the world and completely halted the trade of [[silver]], which is mined on the island.\n\nAdol sets out to find out more about the island's situation in the largest town of Minea. There, he encounters a female [[troubadour]] named Reah. Reah is searching for her Silver Harmonica, which had been stolen, part of a rash of silver thefts that have occurred in the town. Linked with the thefts are sightings of a man in a dark cape. Adol then encounters the fortune-teller Sara, who tells him that she had a vision that a fiery-headed swordsman who would play a key role in Esteria's fate. She tells Adol of the six Books of Ys, named after the ancient kingdom that existed on the island seven hundred years ago. The Books of Ys contain the complete history of the rise and fall of Ys and will be instrumental in saving Esteria. Sara informs Adol that one book is in the Shrine of Solomon and sends him to the town of Zepik to speak with her aunt Jeba to learn more.\n\nIn Zepik, Jeba gives Adol the Key to the Shrine. Adol also meets the mayor of Zepik, and learns that the town's treasured Silver Bells have been stolen. The Silver Bells gave off a sound that drove evil away, and without it, Zepik is vulnerable to demon attack. Adol assumes a mission from the mayor to negotiate the return of the bells from a bandit group in the area. When Adol meets with the bandit leader Goban however, Goban protests that his group only steals from the corrupt to give to the poor, and that in fact all of the bandits' silver possessions have been stolen from them. Adol leaves them and enters the Shrine of Solomon.\n\nAdol fights through demons through the Shrine of Solomon. In the lower levels, he rescues a young girl with long blue hair locked in a cell. The girl reveals that her name is Feena, and that a man with a dark cape imprisoned her there, but otherwise she has [[amnesia|no memories]] about her past. Adol takes Feena to be looked after by Jeba, before returning to the Shrine, where he discovers the first Book of Ys on the lowest level. Returning to Minea, he finds that Sara has been murdered during his absence, with the culprit being a man in a dark cape. Sara had however already given her most important possession to a friend to present to Adol- the second Book of Ys. It is revealed that Reah was the one who has Sara's Book of Ys, and she returns it to Adol in exchange for her Silver Harmonica. He is then directed to the mine of the ruined village of Rastin for the third book. Adol sets off to the mine and recovers that third Book from its depths, and returns to Zepik. There, he finds Feena recovering under Jeba's care.\n\nJeba and her family are descendants of the Ys priest Tovah, and thus Jeba is able to read the ancient text in the Books of Ys to Adol. The three books narrate the story of the creation of Cleria in ancient Ys, which brought great prosperity to the land. However, one day great hordes of demons suddenly appeared and attacked. An evil leader with six greater demons led the evil forces. The people of Ys retreated to the Temple of Solomon where they were besieged. During the siege the twin Goddesses of Ys suddenly disappeared from the Temple, and soon after the evil hordes also disappeared. The six Priests of Ys created the Books of Ys and imbued with magical power so that one day they might guide a hero to save the land of Ys. The people of Ys then reasoned that Cleria had been what attracted the evil and so buried it deep in the ground. Following this, Jeba tells Adol that the remaining books of Ys must be located in the great Tower of Darm, a towering structure which rises up to the clouds. The tower is nicknamed 'The Devil's Tower' and it stands in front of a giant crater named Bagyu Ba'dead.\n\nThe bandit leader Goban is revealed to be Jeba's son, and the bandits' lair was set up in at the entrance of the Tower of Darm to protect the island after the demons appeared. Goban opens the entrance for Adol, noting that his lieutenant Dogi was also somewhere in the tower, having previously entered with other bandits in a successful attempt to destroy the monsters in the tower. Adol climbs the tower, but is soon caught by a magic trap which teleports him into a prison cell. The cell is occupied by Luta Gemma, a sleepwalking poet from Zepik who was captured by the monsters. They are soon rescued by Dogi, who is able to punch through walls with his bare hands. Dogi sends Adol to seek man named Raba on the upper floors. Raba was a scholar visiting Esteria who was inside the Tower of Darm, studying its history, when the demons suddenly appeared. Raba gives Adol a magical amulet which allows Adol to bypass the traps of the tower. In addition, Luta is a descendant of the ancient Ys priest Gemma, and Adol is given another amulet with the power to dispel magic seals. Adol climbs further, finding two more books along the way. Near the top of the tower, Adol discovers that Reah is also in the tower, having let herself be captured and brought there so she could give Adol a magic monocle which would allow him to read the language of the Books of Ys.\n\nAfter reaching the top of the tower, Adol finally confronts the final antagonist \u2013 Dark Fact, a descendant of the ancient Priest Fact. Dark Fact boasts that Adol's efforts to collect the books have only helped his plan, and that once he took Adol's five books and combined them with his own, a great power would be revealed. The two fight, and Adol is victorious. In the folds of Dark Fact's cloak, Adol finds the final Book of Ys. As Adol uses the Monocle to read the entire set of books, a powerful white light fills his vision, and a feeling of serenity overcomes him. The monsters in the land dissolve into air, leaving it at peace. The words in the books begin to disappear and the forms of the Goddesses begin to materialize before him (it is noted that Adol does not recognize the Goddesses' faces). Adol rests and decides to tell Feena all that he has seen as soon as he returns to Zepik. Slowly, the white light envelopes his entire body.\n\n===''Ys II''===\nThe story of ''Ys II'' continues off immediately from the end of Ys I. The game begins with an animated cutscene showing a figures in a dark room talking to a glowing orb about Adol. They are impressed by his having conquered the Tower of Darm, and decide to continue to observe him. The view then shifts to the final moments of Ys I, with light emanating from the Books of Ys and surrounding Adol. Adol then suddenly is flown high into the sky by the magic from the books, as Feena and Reah watch from a cliff outside the tower. The magic energy deposits Adol and the Books of Ys in a flash of light in a field, where he is discovered by a girl. The view pulls back to show that Adol has landed on an [[Floating island (fiction)|island]] floating in the air.\n\nA flashback to 700 years ago is shown: the two Goddesses of Ys are standing around a large glowing orb with their eyes closed, deep in concentration. Outside, a horde of demons lays siege to their location. A flying island is created, and soars high up into the sky, leaving a great crater behind. In the modern day, this island floats far above the Tower of Darm.\n\nWhen Adol wakes up, he weakly asks the girl where he is. She tells him that her name is Lilia and that he is in Ys. Adol is brought to Lance Village and recuperates in Lilia's home. When he wakes up, Lilia's mother tells him about Ys and the surrounding area. Lilia's mother also asks Adol to deliver a letter to the town doctor, Dr. Flair, discussing Lilia's illness. Speaking to villagers of Lance, he learns that demons appeared on the island six months ago, which forced the villagers to abandon the nearby Rasteenie mines. In addition, most of the villagers are aware that there is a world outside of Ys.\n\nAdol goes to the town clinic to look for the doctor, but the doctor is not present. Suddenly, a [[Carrier pigeon|flying pigeon]] arrives at the clinic bearing a message from the doctor, which states that he has been trapped in the Rasteenie mines by a cave in as he was picking herbs. Adol is asked to rescue the doctor from the mines, as only Adol could fight the demons inside. Adol agrees, and meets with the elder of the village to gain permission to enter the mines. The elder consents, but also mentions that he briefly saw two girls that resembled the Goddesses while walking in the ruins surrounding the mines. The elder also tells Adol that his having possession of the Books of Ys shows that he was guided by the spirits of the Priests of Ys to the island. The elder reveals to Adol that there is a place called the Sanctuary of Toal, connected to the Rasteenie mines, which houses statues of all six Priests, and that Adol should return the proper book to each statue in order to learn his purpose on the island.\n\nAdol sets off towards the mines with these three goals. In the ruins outside the mines, Adol discovers a staff that grants him the potential to use magic after he touches it to a statue of the Goddesses. An elderly villager who witnesses this tells Adol that the six magics of the Priests of Ys are still scattered around the island and will be of great use in Adol's quest. Inside the mine, Adol quickly finds Dr. Flair and digs him out, delivering the letter from Lilia's mother at the same time. Dr. Flair reads it and tells Adol that he was searching the mine for the ingredients to cure Lilia's illness. In the rest of the mine Adol finds the herbs the doctor needs, as well as several magical spells. He returns to Dr. Flair with the herbs, and Dr. Flair creates a medicine for Lilia. When Lilia finds out that Adol risked his life to get the ingredients for the medicine, she is eternally grateful and swears a life debt to him.\n\nWhen Adol returns the Books of Ys to the statues of the Priests of Ys, the spirits in the statues reveal that demons appeared on Ys at the same time as they appeared down below on the island of Esteria. They also revealed more about the history of Ys, stating that unknowingly, the source of demons was brought with them when they created the floating island 700 years ago around the Shrine of Solomon. Demons were created as a by-product of magic. The demons\u2019 master resides in the Shrine of Solomon, the former home of the Goddesses and Priests of Ys. Adol must find the Goddesses and defeat the evil in the Shrine of Solomon in order to destroy all the demons forever.\n\nAdol travels out of Lance towards the shrine at the center of the island, passing through the Glacier of Noltia and the lava filled Moat of Burnedbless, two geographical features created by the Goddesses 700 years ago as an attempted deterrent to demons attacking the shrine. In the moat, Adol discovers the Colony of Lava, whose inhabitants are all initially very hostile to him. Adol is barred from passing the bridge out of the village, but, by using the spells he has learned, he discovers that the bridgekeeper's son's Tarf was kidnapped by demons in order to force the villagers to stop Adol at Lava. Adol rescues the boy with the help of a friendly and intelligent demon named Keith, and is allowed to proceed onward from Lava.\n\nAdol finally arrives at the village of Ramia, which stands right outside of the Shrine of Solomon. The past few months, the demons have been kidnapping villagers for use as human sacrifices. Adol meets with an elderly villager, Hadat, whose son, Sada, had recently entered the shrine in an attempt to save his kidnapped fianc\u00e9e, Maria. Hadat gives Adol advice about the shrine and asks him to attempt to save Sada and Maria.\n\nAdol infiltrates the demon filled Shrine of Solomon with the aid of a disguise spell. However, in the middle of the shrine, he is discovered by a dark-cloaked magician named Dalles (recognizable as the dark figure from the introduction cutscene). Dalles is able to see through Adol's disguise and curses Adol with a permanent demonic appearance. Returning to Ramia village to seek help, Adol is able to undo the curse with a help of a Sacred Cup that once belonged to the Priest Hadal. Any water put into it instantly becomes Holy Water, which allows Adol to escape Dalles' curse.\n\nContinuing his infiltration of the shrine, Adol discovers the hideout of some kidnapped villagers who had escaped from captivity. Lilia is surprisingly among them, having left Lance Village due to dreams of needing to help Adol in his quest. However, Dalles once again makes an appearance, thanking Adol for leading him to the escapees, and turns everyone into stone, leaving only Adol unharmed so he would suffer mentally.\n\nUndaunted, Adol keeps exploring the rest of the Shrine of Solomon, and again encounters the friendly demon Keith, who tells him that Maria is being held for sacrifice in a nearby [[bell tower]] called the Campanile of Lane. Adol enters the bell tower, fighting toward the top, defeating the demon sorceress Zava and seeing Maria along the way. At the top of the tower, Adol attempts to stop the ritual, but Dalles appears again and ensures the sacrifice is not disrupted. Adol then discovers the Dreaming Stone Idol, an artifact that is able to reverse magical petrification. He also notices that Maria has disappeared from where he had just seen her. With the artifact, Adol is able to return the stone villagers (including Sada) to normal before setting off to the innermost core of the shrine. Dalles appears once more to block Adol's way, and the two engage in a fight to the death, with Adol emerging victorious.\n\nAs Adol heads into the core, he finds that many villagers, all of them descendants of the Priests of Ys, have come to aid him. He also discovers that Maria had survived the sacrificial ritual, thanks to a magical bracelet passed down through her family. Lilia also appears, and provides Adol with a ring that can break the magic barriers barring his way. Right outside the final room, Adol discovers the two Goddesses imprisoned by magic energy. He is taunted by the voice of the master of the demons, who reveals that after 700 years, it has finally broken free of the imprisonment thrust upon it by the Goddesses and the Priests of Ys, and now demons would finally rule the world.\n\nSuddenly, Goban Tovah and Luta Gemma from Ys I appear in the room. They had climbed the Tower of Darm after having a dream in which the Goddesses told them Ys was returning to the surface and they were needed. Goban provides Adol with Reah's Silver Harmonica, the sound of which dispels the energy binding the Goddesses. Adol is finally able to meet the Goddesses, who are confirmed to be Feena and Reah.\n\nReah explains the events that had led to this point: 700 years ago, after the demons had been defeated, the Goddesses sealed away the power of the Black Pearl, a great orb that was the source of magic in the society of Ancient Ys, as they had discovered the magic from the Black Pearl had caused the creation of demons as a side effect. The Goddesses also chose to stay behind on the surface of Esteria, and sealed away the magic-enhancing metal Cleria deep in the ground, after which they went into a long slumber. Centuries passed and all was peaceful, but some Cleria was accidentally mined by the inhabitants of Esteria while they were mining silver. This released enough magic to enable Dark Fact to break the seal on the Black Pearl, leading to the events of Ys I.\n\nThe Goddesses do not have the strength to seal the demons again, and must now rely on Adol to be their champion. With the descendants of the Priests of Ys and the Goddesses present, Adol is lent their power before he faces his final opponent: the sentient form of the Black Pearl, Darm. After a long battle, Adol is able to destroy it, wiping out all the demons in Ys.\n\nAdol reappears in the sanctuary of the Goddesses, along with Feena, Reah, and all the descendants of the Priests. They all congratulate him and note that with the Black Pearl destroyed, the floating island of Ys was slowly sinking back to its original position, in the giant crater on Esteria. Tearfully, Feena says goodbye to Adol, as the Goddesses will once again enter a magic sleep to watch over Esteria and make sure the magic from the Black Pearl does not return, and she wished to confess her feelings for him before then, asking him to always remember her. They slowly part ways, as the inhabitants of Ys prepare for a new era, rejoined with the rest of the world.\n\n==Remakes==\n===Microsoft Windows===\n''Ys Eternal'' was a remake of ''Ys I & II'' released in Japan for [[Microsoft Windows]] platform in 1997.

In the first game he must seek out the six Books of Ys. These books contain the history of the ancient, vanished land of Ys, and will give him the knowledge he needs to defeat the evil forces currently sweeping the land of Esteria.\n\nIn ''Ys II'' Adol is transported to the [[Floating island (fiction)|floating]] civilization of Ys, and begins a quest to unravel the secrets of the land, and finally rid it and Esteria of evil. All English translations of ''Ys II'' were part of a compilation; no standalone version has been localized (except for iOS and Android ports).\n\n==Plot==\n{{long plot|section|date=December 2016}}\n\n===''Ys I''===\n''Ys I'' begins with a cutscene showing the main character, Adol Christin, gazing out to sea at the Stormwall which appeared around the island Esteria six months ago. Determined to investigate the situation, Adol sets off towards Esteria on a small boat; however, it is sunk by the storm and Adol washes up on the shore of Esteria. He is saved by a villager named Slaff from the port town of Barbado. Adol recuperates in the home of Barbado's doctor and learns that Slaff is both the doctor's son and the head of the town's militia. The militia was formed when demons and monsters appeared on the island, at the same time as when the Stormwall formed. The Stormwall cut Esteria off from the rest of the world and completely halted the trade of [[silver]], which is mined on the island.\n\nAdol sets out to find out more about the island's situation in the largest town of Minea. There, he encounters a female [[troubadour]] named Reah. Reah is searching for her Silver Harmonica, which had been stolen, part of a rash of silver thefts that have occurred in the town. Linked with the thefts are sightings of a man in a dark cape. Adol then encounters the fortune-teller Sara, who tells him that she had a vision that a fiery-headed swordsman who would play a key role in Esteria's fate. She tells Adol of the six Books of Ys, named after the ancient kingdom that existed on the island seven hundred years ago. The Books of Ys contain the complete history of the rise and fall of Ys and will be instrumental in saving Esteria. Sara informs Adol that one book is in the Shrine of Solomon and sends him to the town of Zepik to speak with her aunt Jeba to learn more.\n\nIn Zepik, Jeba gives Adol the Key to the Shrine. Adol also meets the mayor of Zepik, and learns that the town's treasured Silver Bells have been stolen. The Silver Bells gave off a sound that drove evil away, and without it, Zepik is vulnerable to demon attack. Adol assumes a mission from the mayor to negotiate the return of the bells from a bandit group in the area. When Adol meets with the bandit leader Goban however, Goban protests that his group only steals from the corrupt to give to the poor, and that in fact all of the bandits' silver possessions have been stolen from them. Adol leaves them and enters the Shrine of Solomon.\n\nAdol fights through demons through the Shrine of Solomon. In the lower levels, he rescues a young girl with long blue hair locked in a cell. The girl reveals that her name is Feena, and that a man with a dark cape imprisoned her there, but otherwise she has [[amnesia|no memories]] about her past. Adol takes Feena to be looked after by Jeba, before returning to the Shrine, where he discovers the first Book of Ys on the lowest level. Returning to Minea, he finds that Sara has been murdered during his absence, with the culprit being a man in a dark cape. Sara had however already given her most important possession to a friend to present to Adol- the second Book of Ys. It is revealed that Reah was the one who has Sara's Book of Ys, and she returns it to Adol in exchange for her Silver Harmonica. He is then directed to the mine of the ruined village of Rastin for the third book. Adol sets off to the mine and recovers that third Book from its depths, and returns to Zepik. There, he finds Feena recovering under Jeba's care.\n\nJeba and her family are descendants of the Ys priest Tovah, and thus Jeba is able to read the ancient text in the Books of Ys to Adol. The three books narrate the story of the creation of Cleria in ancient Ys, which brought great prosperity to the land. However, one day great hordes of demons suddenly appeared and attacked. An evil leader with six greater demons led the evil forces. The people of Ys retreated to the Temple of Solomon where they were besieged. During the siege the twin Goddesses of Ys suddenly disappeared from the Temple, and soon after the evil hordes also disappeared. The six Priests of Ys created the Books of Ys and imbued with magical power so that one day they might guide a hero to save the land of Ys. The people of Ys then reasoned that Cleria had been what attracted the evil and so buried it deep in the ground. Following this, Jeba tells Adol that the remaining books of Ys must be located in the great Tower of Darm, a towering structure which rises up to the clouds. The tower is nicknamed 'The Devil's Tower' and it stands in front of a giant crater named Bagyu Ba'dead.\n\nThe bandit leader Goban is revealed to be Jeba's son, and the bandits' lair was set up in at the entrance of the Tower of Darm to protect the island after the demons appeared. Goban opens the entrance for Adol, noting that his lieutenant Dogi was also somewhere in the tower, having previously entered with other bandits in a successful attempt to destroy the monsters in the tower. Adol climbs the tower, but is soon caught by a magic trap which teleports him into a prison cell. The cell is occupied by Luta Gemma, a sleepwalking poet from Zepik who was captured by the monsters. They are soon rescued by Dogi, who is able to punch through walls with his bare hands. Dogi sends Adol to seek man named Raba on the upper floors. Raba was a scholar visiting Esteria who was inside the Tower of Darm, studying its history, when the demons suddenly appeared. Raba gives Adol a magical amulet which allows Adol to bypass the traps of the tower. In addition, Luta is a descendant of the ancient Ys priest Gemma, and Adol is given another amulet with the power to dispel magic seals. Adol climbs further, finding two more books along the way. Near the top of the tower, Adol discovers that Reah is also in the tower, having let herself be captured and brought there so she could give Adol a magic monocle which would allow him to read the language of the Books of Ys.\n\nAfter reaching the top of the tower, Adol finally confronts the final antagonist \u2013 Dark Fact, a descendant of the ancient Priest Fact. Dark Fact boasts that Adol's efforts to collect the books have only helped his plan, and that once he took Adol's five books and combined them with his own, a great power would be revealed. The two fight, and Adol is victorious. In the folds of Dark Fact's cloak, Adol finds the final Book of Ys. As Adol uses the Monocle to read the entire set of books, a powerful white light fills his vision, and a feeling of serenity overcomes him. The monsters in the land dissolve into air, leaving it at peace. The words in the books begin to disappear and the forms of the Goddesses begin to materialize before him (it is noted that Adol does not recognize the Goddesses' faces). Adol rests and decides to tell Feena all that he has seen as soon as he returns to Zepik. Slowly, the white light envelopes his entire body.\n\n===''Ys II''===\nThe story of ''Ys II'' continues off immediately from the end of Ys I. The game begins with an animated cutscene showing a figures in a dark room talking to a glowing orb about Adol. They are impressed by his having conquered the Tower of Darm, and decide to continue to observe him. The view then shifts to the final moments of Ys I, with light emanating from the Books of Ys and surrounding Adol. Adol then suddenly is flown high into the sky by the magic from the books, as Feena and Reah watch from a cliff outside the tower. The magic energy deposits Adol and the Books of Ys in a flash of light in a field, where he is discovered by a girl. The view pulls back to show that Adol has landed on an [[Floating island (fiction)|island]] floating in the air.\n\nA flashback to 700 years ago is shown: the two Goddesses of Ys are standing around a large glowing orb with their eyes closed, deep in concentration. Outside, a horde of demons lays siege to their location. A flying island is created, and soars high up into the sky, leaving a great crater behind. In the modern day, this island floats far above the Tower of Darm.\n\nWhen Adol wakes up, he weakly asks the girl where he is. She tells him that her name is Lilia and that he is in Ys. Adol is brought to Lance Village and recuperates in Lilia\u2019s home. When he wakes up, Lilia\u2019s mother tells him about Ys and the surrounding area. Lilia\u2019s mother also asks Adol to deliver a letter to the town doctor, Dr. Flair, discussing Lilia\u2019s illness. Speaking to villagers of Lance, he learns that demons appeared on the island six months ago, which forced the villagers to abandon the nearby Rasteenie mines. In addition, most of the villagers are aware that there is a world outside of Ys.\n\nAdol goes to the town clinic to look for the doctor, but the doctor is not present. Suddenly, a [[Carrier pigeon|flying pigeon]] arrives at the clinic bearing a message from the doctor, which states that he has been trapped in the Rasteenie mines by a cave in as he was picking herbs. Adol is asked to rescue the doctor from the mines, as only Adol could fight the demons inside. Adol agrees, and meets with the elder of the village to gain permission to enter the mines. The elder consents, but also mentions that he briefly saw two girls that resembled the Goddesses while walking in the ruins surrounding the mines. The elder also tells Adol that his having possession of the Books of Ys shows that he was guided by the spirits of the Priests of Ys to the island. The elder reveals to Adol that there is a place called the Sanctuary of Toal, connected to the Rasteenie mines, which houses statues of all six Priests, and that Adol should return the proper book to each statue in order to learn his purpose on the island.\n\nAdol sets off towards the mines with these three goals. In the ruins outside the mines, Adol discovers a staff that grants him the potential to use magic after he touches it to a statue of the Goddesses. An elderly villager who witnesses this tells Adol that the six magics of the Priests of Ys are still scattered around the island and will be of great use in Adol\u2019s quest. Inside the mine, Adol quickly finds Dr. Flair and digs him out, delivering the letter from Lilia\u2019s mother at the same time. Dr. Flair reads it and tells Adol that he was searching the mine for the ingredients to cure Lilia\u2019s illness. In the rest of the mine Adol finds the herbs the doctor needs, as well as several magical spells. He returns to Dr. Flair with the herbs, and Dr. Flair creates a medicine for Lilia. When Lilia finds out that Adol risked his life to get the ingredients for the medicine, she is eternally grateful and swears a life debt to him.\n\nWhen Adol returns the Books of Ys to the statues of the Priests of Ys, the spirits in the statues reveal that demons appeared on Ys at the same time as they appeared down below on the island of Esteria. They also revealed more about the history of Ys, stating that unknowingly, the source of demons was brought with them when they created the floating island 700 years ago around the Shrine of Solomon. Demons were created as a by-product of magic. The demons\u2019 master resides in the Shrine of Solomon, the former home of the Goddesses and Priests of Ys. Adol must find the Goddesses and defeat the evil in the Shrine of Solomon in order to destroy all the demons forever.\n\nAdol travels out of Lance towards the shrine at the center of the island, passing through the Glacier of Noltia and the lava filled Moat of Burnedbless, two geographical features created by the Goddesses 700 years ago as an attempted deterrent to demons attacking the shrine. In the moat, Adol discovers the Colony of Lava, whose inhabitants are all initially very hostile to him. Adol is barred from passing the bridge out of the village, but, by using the spells he has learned, he discovers that the bridgekeeper\u2019s son\u2019s Tarf was kidnapped by demons in order to force the villagers to stop Adol at Lava. Adol rescues the boy with the help of a friendly and intelligent demon named Keith, and is allowed to proceed onward from Lava.\n\nAdol finally arrives at the village of Ramia, which stands right outside of the Shrine of Solomon. The past few months, the demons have been kidnapping villagers for use as human sacrifices. Adol meets with an elderly villager, Hadat, whose son, Sada, had recently entered the shrine in an attempt to save his kidnapped fianc\u00e9e, Maria. Hadat gives Adol advice about the shrine and asks him to attempt to save Sada and Maria.\n\nAdol infiltrates the demon filled Shrine of Solomon with the aid of a disguise spell. However, in the middle of the shrine, he is discovered by a dark-cloaked magician named Dalles (recognizable as the dark figure from the introduction cutscene). Dalles is able to see through Adol\u2019s disguise and curses Adol with a permanent demonic appearance. Returning to Ramia village to seek help, Adol is able to undo the curse with a help of a Sacred Cup that once belonged to the Priest Hadal. Any water put into it instantly becomes Holy Water, which allows Adol to escape Dalles' curse.\n\nContinuing his infiltration of the shrine, Adol discovers the hideout of some kidnapped villagers who had escaped from captivity. Lilia is surprisingly among them, having left Lance Village due to dreams of needing to help Adol in his quest. However, Dalles once again makes an appearance, thanking Adol for leading him to the escapees, and turns everyone into stone, leaving only Adol unharmed so he would suffer mentally.\n\nUndaunted, Adol keeps exploring the rest of the Shrine of Solomon, and again encounters the friendly demon Keith, who tells him that Maria is being held for sacrifice in a nearby [[bell tower]] called the Campanile of Lane. Adol enters the bell tower, fighting toward the top, defeating the demon sorceress Zava and seeing Maria along the way. At the top of the tower, Adol attempts to stop the ritual, but Dalles appears again and ensures the sacrifice is not disrupted. Adol then discovers the Dreaming Stone Idol, an artifact that is able to reverse magical petrification. He also notices that Maria has disappeared from where he had just seen her. With the artifact, Adol is able to return the stone villagers (including Sada) to normal before setting off to the innermost core of the shrine. Dalles appears once more to block Adol\u2019s way, and the two engage in a fight to the death, with Adol emerging victorious.\n\nAs Adol heads into the core, he finds that many villagers, all of them descendants of the Priests of Ys, have come to aid him. He also discovers that Maria had survived the sacrificial ritual, thanks to a magical bracelet passed down through her family. Lilia also appears, and provides Adol with a ring that can break the magic barriers barring his way. Right outside the final room, Adol discovers the two Goddesses imprisoned by magic energy. He is taunted by the voice of the master of the demons, who reveals that after 700 years, it has finally broken free of the imprisonment thrust upon it by the Goddesses and the Priests of Ys, and now demons would finally rule the world.\n\nSuddenly, Goban Tovah and Luta Gemma from Ys I appear in the room. They had climbed the Tower of Darm after having a dream in which the Goddesses told them Ys was returning to the surface and they were needed. Goban provides Adol with Reah's Silver Harmonica, the sound of which dispels the energy binding the Goddesses. Adol is finally able to meet the Goddesses, who are confirmed to be Feena and Reah.\n\nReah explains the events that had led to this point: 700 years ago, after the demons had been defeated, the Goddesses sealed away the power of the Black Pearl, a great orb that was the source of magic in the society of Ancient Ys, as they had discovered the magic from the Black Pearl had caused the creation of demons as a side effect. The Goddesses also chose to stay behind on the surface of Esteria, and sealed away the magic-enhancing metal Cleria deep in the ground, after which they went into a long slumber. Centuries passed and all was peaceful, but some Cleria was accidentally mined by the inhabitants of Esteria while they were mining silver. This released enough magic to enable Dark Fact to break the seal on the Black Pearl, leading to the events of Ys I.\n\nThe Goddesses do not have the strength to seal the demons again, and must now rely on Adol to be their champion. With the descendants of the Priests of Ys and the Goddesses present, Adol is lent their power before he faces his final opponent: the sentient form of the Black Pearl, Darm. After a long battle, Adol is able to destroy it, wiping out all the demons in Ys.\n\nAdol reappears in the sanctuary of the Goddesses, along with Feena, Reah, and all the descendants of the Priests. They all congratulate him and note that with the Black Pearl destroyed, the floating island of Ys was slowly sinking back to its original position, in the giant crater on Esteria. Tearfully, Feena says goodbye to Adol, as the Goddesses will once again enter a magic sleep to watch over Esteria and make sure the magic from the Black Pearl does not return, and she wished to confess her feelings for him before then, asking him to always remember her. They slowly part ways, as the inhabitants of Ys prepare for a new era, rejoined with the rest of the world.\n\n==Remakes==\n===Microsoft Windows===\n''Ys Eternal'' was a remake of ''Ys I & II'' released in Japan for [[Microsoft Windows]] platform in 1997.
