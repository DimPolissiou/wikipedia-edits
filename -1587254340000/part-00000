This resulted in negative publicity for the studios and decreasing numbers of theater goers, who were uninterested in films that were sometimes so severely edited that they were incoherent.<ref name=Kimono /> In 1929, more than 50 percent of American moviegoers lived in a location overseen by such a board.<ref name=Black96/>\n\nIn 1924, Hays instituted \"The Formula\", a loose set of guidelines for filmmakers, in an effort to get the movie industry to self-regulate the issues that the censorship boards had been created to address. \"The Formula\" requested that studios send synopses of films being considered to the MPPDA for review. This effort largely failed, however, as studios were under no obligation to send their scripts to Hays's office, nor to follow his recommendations.<ref name=Black96>{{cite book |author=Gregory D.

Hays also created a Studio Relations Department (SRD) with staff available to the studios for script reviews and advice regarding potential problems. Again, despite Hays' efforts, studios largely ignored the \"Don'ts and Be Carefuls,\" and by the end of 1929, the MPPDA received only about 20 percent of Hollywood scripts prior to production,<ref name=Kimono /> and the number of regional and local censorship boards continued to increase.<ref name=Black96/>\n\n===Production Code: 1930\u201334===\n\nIn 1930, the MPPDA introduced the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code]], sometimes called the \"Hays Code\".

Among other rules, the code prohibited inclusion of \"scenes of passion\" unless they were essential to a film's plot; \"pointed profanity\" in either word or action; \"sex perversion\"; justification or explicit coverage of adultery; sympathetic treatment of crime or criminals; dancing with \"indecent\" moves; and white slavery.<ref name=Calgary30>{{cite news |title=Producers Adopt Code of Conduct For Screen Shows |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WyRkAAAAIBAJ&dq=motion%20picture%20producers%20and%20distributors%20of%20america&pg=3606%2C4315324 |work=The Calgary Daily Herald |date=1 April 1930 |accessdate=1 February 2013}}</ref> Because studio executives had been involved in the decision to adopt the code, MPPDA-member studios were more willing to submit scripts for consideration.

It has long worked to curb [[copyright infringement]], including recent attempts to limit the sharing of [[copyright]]ed works via [[peer-to-peer]] [[file-sharing]] networks and by streaming from pirate sites. Former United States Ambassador to France [[Charles Rivkin]] is the chairman and CEO.\n\n==History==\n\n===Foundation and early history: 1922\u201329===\n\nThe MPA was founded as the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA) in 1922 as a [[trade association]] of member motion picture companies.

This resulted in negative publicity for the studios and decreasing numbers of theater goers, who were uninterested in films that were sometimes so severely edited that they were incoherent.<ref name=Kimono /> In 1929, more than 50 percent of American moviegoers lived in a location overseen by such a board.<ref name=Black96/>\n\nIn 1924, Hays instituted \"The Formula\", a loose set of guidelines for filmmakers, in an effort to get the movie industry to self-regulate the issues that the censorship boards had been created to address. \"The Formula\" requested that studios send synopses of films being considered to the MPPDA for review.

Among other rules, the code prohibited inclusion of \"scenes of passion\" unless they were essential to a film's plot; \"pointed profanity\" in either word or action; \"sex perversion\"; justification or explicit coverage of adultery; sympathetic treatment of crime or criminals; dancing with \"indecent\" moves; and white slavery.<ref name=Calgary30>{{cite news |title=Producers Adopt Code of Conduct For Screen Shows |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WyRkAAAAIBAJ&dq=motion%20picture%20producers%20and%20distributors%20of%20america&pg=3606%2C4315324 |work=The Calgary Daily Herald |date=1 April 1930 |accessdate=1 February 2013}}</ref> Because studio executives had been involved in the decision to adopt the code, MPPDA-member studios were more willing to submit scripts for consideration.

The show was later renamed ''[[Seinfeld]]'' to avoid confusion with the short-lived teen sitcom ''The Marshall Chronicles''. By its third season, it had become the most watched sitcom on American television. The final episode aired in 1998, and the show has been a popular [[Television syndication|syndicated]] re-run. Along with Seinfeld, the show starred ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' veteran [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] and experienced actors [[Michael Richards]] and [[Jason Alexander]]. Alexander played George, a caricature of [[Larry David]]. Seinfeld is the only actor to appear in every episode of the show.<ref>Jason Alexander did not appear in \"[[The Pen]]\"; Julia Louis-Dreyfus did not appear in [[The Seinfeld Chronicles|the pilot]], \"[[The Trip, Part 1]]\", or \"[[The Trip, Part 2]]\"; and Michael Richards did not appear in \"[[The Chinese Restaurant]]\" or \"The Pen\".</ref>\n\nSeinfeld has said that his show was influenced by the 1950s sitcom ''[[The Abbott and Costello Show]]''. In the \"Seinfeld Season 6\" DVD set, commenting on the episode \"[[The Gymnast]]\", Seinfeld cited [[Jean Shepherd]] as an influence, saying, \"He really formed my entire comedic sensibility\u2014I learned how to do comedy from Jean Shepherd.\" From 2004 to 2007, the former ''Seinfeld'' cast and crew recorded audio commentaries for episodes of the DVD releases of the show.\n\n===Post-''Seinfeld''===\nAfter he ended his sitcom, Seinfeld returned to [[New York City]] to make a comeback with his [[stand-up comedy]] rather than stay in [[Los Angeles]] and continue his acting career. In 1998 he went on tour and recorded a comedy special, titled ''[[I'm Telling You for the Last Time]]''. The process of developing and performing new material at clubs around the world was chronicled in a 2002 documentary, ''[[Comedian (film)|Comedian]]'', which also featured fellow comic [[Orny Adams]] and was directed by Christian Charles. Seinfeld has written several books, mostly archives of past routines. In the late 1990s, [[Apple Computer]] came up with the advertising slogan \"[[Think different]]\" and produced a 60-second commercial to promote the slogan. This commercial showed people who were able to \"think differently\", such as [[Albert Einstein]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and many others. It was later cut short to 30 seconds and altered such that Seinfeld was included at the end, whereas he had not been in the original cut. This shorter version of the commercial aired only once, during the [[The Finale (Seinfeld)|series finale]] of ''Seinfeld''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theapplecollection.com/Collection/AppleMovies/mov/jerrysteinfield.mov |title=Seinfeld's commercial |accessdate=August 22, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716221221/http://www.theapplecollection.com/Collection/AppleMovies/mov/jerrysteinfield.mov |archivedate=July 16, 2011}}</ref>[[File:Jerry Seinfeld (1997).jpg|thumb|Seinfeld at the [[1996 Emmy Awards]]|alt=|left|235x235px]] In 2004, Seinfeld appeared in two commercial [[webisode]]s promoting [[American Express]], titled ''[[The Adventures of Seinfeld & Superman]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/30/business/media-business-advertising-seinfeld-superman-join-forces-again-spots-for.html |title=Seinfeld and Superman join forces again in spots for American Express, this time on the Web. |last=Elliott |first=Stuart |newspaper=New York Times |date=March 30, 2004 |accessdate=March 19, 2016}}</ref> In these, Seinfeld appeared with a cartoon rendering of [[Superman]], who was referenced in numerous episodes of ''Seinfeld'' as Seinfeld's hero, voiced by [[Patrick Warburton]] (character [[David Puddy]] on ''Seinfeld'').

Seinfeld and \"Superman\" were also interviewed by [[Matt Lauer]] in a specially recorded interview for the ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' show. On November 18, 2004, Seinfeld appeared at the [[National Museum of American History]] to donate the \"puffy shirt\" he wore in the ''Seinfeld'' episode [[The Puffy Shirt|of the same name]]. He also gave a speech when presenting the \"puffy shirt\", saying humorously that \"This is the most embarrassing moment of my life.\"{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} On May 13, 2006, Seinfeld had a cameo appearance on ''Saturday Night Live'' as host Julia Louis-Dreyfus' assassin. Louis-Dreyfus in her opening monolog mentioned the \"Seinfeld curse\". While talking about how ridiculous the \"curse\" was, a [[Stage lighting instrument|stage light]] suddenly fell next to her.

In the \"Seinfeld Season 6\" DVD set, commenting on the episode \"[[The Gymnast]]\", Seinfeld cited [[Jean Shepherd]] as an influence, saying, \"He really formed my entire comedic sensibility\u2014I learned how to do comedy from Jean Shepherd.\" From 2004 to 2007, the former ''Seinfeld'' cast and crew recorded audio commentaries for episodes of the DVD releases of the show.\n\n===Post-''Seinfeld''===\nAfter he ended his sitcom, Seinfeld returned to [[New York City]] to make a comeback with his [[stand-up comedy]] rather than stay in [[Los Angeles]] and continue his acting career. In 1998 he went on tour and recorded a comedy special, titled ''[[I'm Telling You for the Last Time]]''. The process of developing and performing new material at clubs around the world was chronicled in a 2002 documentary, ''[[Comedian (film)|Comedian]]'', which also featured fellow comic [[Orny Adams]] and was directed by Christian Charles. Seinfeld has written several books, mostly archives of past routines. In the late 1990s, [[Apple Computer]] came up with the advertising slogan \"[[Think different]]\" and produced a 60-second commercial to promote the slogan. This commercial showed people who were able to \"think differently\", such as [[Albert Einstein]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and many others. It was later cut short to 30 seconds and altered such that Seinfeld was included at the end, whereas he had not been in the original cut. This shorter version of the commercial aired only once, during the [[The Finale (Seinfeld)|series finale]] of ''Seinfeld''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theapplecollection.com/Collection/AppleMovies/mov/jerrysteinfield.mov |title=Seinfeld's commercial |accessdate=August 22, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716221221/http://www.theapplecollection.com/Collection/AppleMovies/mov/jerrysteinfield.mov |archivedate=July 16, 2011}}</ref>[[File:Jerry Seinfeld (1997).jpg|thumb|Seinfeld at the [[1996 Emmy Awards]]|alt=|left|235x235px]] In 2004, Seinfeld appeared in two commercial [[webisode]]s promoting [[American Express]], titled ''[[The Adventures of Seinfeld & Superman]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/30/business/media-business-advertising-seinfeld-superman-join-forces-again-spots-for.html |title=Seinfeld and Superman join forces again in spots for American Express, this time on the Web. |last=Elliott |first=Stuart |newspaper=New York Times |date=March 30, 2004 |accessdate=March 19, 2016}}</ref> In these, Seinfeld appeared with a cartoon rendering of [[Superman]], who was referenced in numerous episodes of ''Seinfeld'' as Seinfeld's hero, voiced by [[Patrick Warburton]] (character [[David Puddy]] on ''Seinfeld'').

The chart is, therefore, more focused on charting albums based on weekly sales. On October 1996, RIM started incorporating electronic point-of-sale (EPOS) into its chart, compiling data from more than 50 retail stores such as Salem Power Station, Music Valley and CD Rama.<ref>{{cite journal |date=October 26, 1996 |first=Alexandra |last=Nuvich |title=Malaysia Leads Asia with EPOS Charts |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=108 |issue=43 |page=5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xwkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA5&lpg=PA5&dq=malaysia+rim+charts&source=bl&ots=71-BMieizv&sig=YPAM06iuuNzEr4p0dFiYsYW73pw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi4tMidpPvUAhUFvo8KHcXcANE4ChDoAQgxMAM#v=onepage&q=malaysia%20rim%20charts&f=false |accessdate=July 9, 2017}}</ref> However, the charts were discontinued in 2006 owing to dwindling album sales in relation to public disinterest to buy album as a whole and difficulties to tabulate the charts due to insufficient information from the retailers on the physical sales.<ref name=\"rimchartsreturnstar2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.star2.com/entertainment/music/music-news/2017/03/12/the-rim-charts-are-back/|title=Malaysia\u2019s RIM Charts are back|date=March 12, 2017|accessdate=July 9, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, digital music consumption in Malaysia accounted for RM 72.7 mil revenue (39.2%) to the Malaysian music industry in 2016, of which RM31.1mil is contributed from audio streaming alone.

The chart is, therefore, more focused on charting albums based on weekly sales.

Goldfish had left [[Famous Players-Lasky|Lasky's Feature Play Company]], of which he was a co-founder, in 1916 when Feature Play merged with Famous Players. Margaret Mayo, Edgar's wife & play writer, and [[Arthur Hopkins]], a Broadway producer, joined the trio as writer and director general.<ref name=flft/>\n\nAt the beginning, Goldwyn Pictures rented production facilities from [[Solax Studios]] when it and many other early [[film studio]]s in [[America's first motion picture industry]] were based in [[Fort Lee, New Jersey|Fort Lee]], [[New Jersey]]. The company's first release was ''[[Polly of the Circus (1917 film)|Polly of the Circus]]'', an adaptation of Mayo's play, in September 1917 starting [[Mae Marsh]].<ref name=flfs>{{Cite web   | title = Studios and Films   | work =    | publisher = Fort Lee Film Commission   | date =    | url = http://www.fortleefilm.org/studios.html   | doi =    | accessdate = 2011-05-30   | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181020130551/http://fortleefilm.org/studios.html   | archive-date = October 20, 2018   | url-status = dead   }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ViR3b72xkK0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Fort+Lee+Birthplace+of+the+Motion+Picture+Industry#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Fort Lee: Birthplace of the Motion Picture Industry|last=Fort Lee Film Commission|first=|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|year=2006|isbn=0738545015|location=|pages=}}</ref> By April 1917, Goldwyn Pictures agreed to rent the [[Universal Pictures]] studios in Fort Lee, then having the second largest stage, and had two film companies operating at the time with plans for more production companies. The company management planned on having 12 films done by September 1, 1917 without distributing the films so as to be able to show advanced footage to the theaters. Goldfish also associated the company with [[Columbia University]] via Professor Victor Freeburg's Photoplay Writing class in 1917 to increase the company's artistic standings.<ref name=flft/> The company also released other production companies films with [[Marie Dressler]]'s Dressler Producing Corporation film, [[The Scrub Lady]], in 1917. The company was forced in October 1917 to switch out ''The Eternal Magalene'' for ''[[Fighting Odds]]'', both starring [[Maxine Elliott]], after the [[National Board of Review]] cleared the Magalene movie while censors in [[Pennsylvania]] state and [[Chicago]] city did not approve the film. ''[[Thais (American film)|Thais]]'' starring [[Mary Garden]] was released in late 1917 which was a costly loss.<ref name=flft/>\n\nIn January 1918, Goldfish signed director [[Raoul Walsh]] and prematurely announced it as there were two years left on Walsh's contract with Fox. With ''Thais'' being the company's second costly loss, Goldwyn decreased film budgets partly by not using theater divas to cross over to film and reducing design driven films. Instead, he rely on comedies starring [[Madge Kennedy]] and [[Mabel Normand]]. In August 1918, Goldwyn Pictures signed [[Will Rogers]], at that time a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] Follies favorite, to star in a [[Rex Beach]] production, ''Laughing Bill Hyde'', filmed at the Fort Lee studio for release in September.<ref name=flft/> The company purchased the [[Sony Pictures Studios|Triangle Studios]] in Culver City in 1918.<ref name=flfs/><ref>{{cite web|title=Lot History|url=http://www.sonypicturesmuseum.com/studio/lothistory|website=Sony Picture Museum|publisher=Sony Pictures Entertainment|accessdate=February 5, 2015|page=1|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205172234/http://www.sonypicturesmuseum.com/studio/lothistory|archivedate=February 5, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Goldwyn then headed west out to Culver City in the Winter of 1918 which opening operations there also caused an increase in film expenses.<ref name=flft/> Seeing an opportunity in December, Samuel Goldfish then had his name legally changed to [[Samuel Goldwyn]].\n\nIn 1919, Frank Joseph \"Joe\" Godsol became an investor in Goldwyn Pictures.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Kevin|last2=Lewis|first2=Arnold|date=June\u2013July 1988|title=Include Me out: Samuel Goldwyn and Joe Godsol|journal=Film History|publisher=Indiana University Press|volume=2|issue=2|pages=133\u2013153|jstor=3815031}}</ref>\n\nGoldwyn began looking to follow other film companies, like [[Loews Cineplex Entertainment|Loews Theaters]]/[[Metro Pictures]] and [[First National Pictures|First National]], into vertical integration.

Goldwyn}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nGoldwyn Pictures Corporation was founded on November 19, 1916 by [[Samuel Goldwyn|Samuel Goldfish]] partnering with [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] producers [[Edgar Selwyn|Edgar]] and [[Archibald Selwyn]] using an [[Amalgamation (names)|amalgamation]] of both last names to create the name. Goldfish had left [[Famous Players-Lasky|Lasky's Feature Play Company]], of which he was a co-founder, in 1916 when Feature Play merged with Famous Players. Margaret Mayo, Edgar's wife & play writer, and [[Arthur Hopkins]], a Broadway producer, joined the trio as writer and director general.<ref name=flft/>\n\nAt the beginning, Goldwyn Pictures rented production facilities from [[Solax Studios]] when it and many other early [[film studio]]s in [[America's first motion picture industry]] were based in [[Fort Lee, New Jersey|Fort Lee]], [[New Jersey]]. The company's first release was ''[[Polly of the Circus (1917 film)|Polly of the Circus]]'', an adaptation of Mayo's play, in September 1917 starting [[Mae Marsh]].<ref name=flfs>{{Cite web   | title = Studios and Films   | work =    | publisher = Fort Lee Film Commission   | date =    | url = http://www.fortleefilm.org/studios.html   | doi =    | accessdate = 2011-05-30   | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181020130551/http://fortleefilm.org/studios.html   | archive-date = October 20, 2018   | url-status = dead   }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ViR3b72xkK0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Fort+Lee+Birthplace+of+the+Motion+Picture+Industry#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Fort Lee: Birthplace of the Motion Picture Industry|last=Fort Lee Film Commission|first=|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|year=2006|isbn=0738545015|location=|pages=}}</ref> By April 1917, Goldwyn Pictures agreed to rent the [[Universal Pictures]] studios in Fort Lee, then having the second largest stage, and had two film companies operating at the time with plans for more production companies. The company management planned on having 12 films done by September 1, 1917 without distributing the films so as to be able to show advanced footage to the theaters. Goldfish also associated the company with [[Columbia University]] via Professor Victor Freeburg's Photoplay Writing class in 1917 to increase the company's artistic standings.<ref name=flft/> The company also released other production companies films with [[Marie Dressler]]'s Dressler Producing Corporation film, [[The Scrub Lady]], in 1917. The company was forced in October 1917 to switch out ''The Eternal Magalene'' for ''[[Fighting Odds]]'', both starring [[Maxine Elliott]], after the [[National Board of Review]] cleared the Magalene movie while censors in [[Pennsylvania]] state and [[Chicago]] city did not approve the film. ''[[Thais (American film)|Thais]]'' starring [[Mary Garden]] was released in late 1917 which was a costly loss.<ref name=flft/>\n\nIn January 1918, Goldfish signed director [[Raoul Walsh]] and prematurely announced it as there were two years left on Walsh's contract with Fox. With ''Thais'' being the company's second costly loss, Goldwyn decreased film budgets partly by not using theater divas to cross over to film and reducing design driven films. Instead, he rely on comedies starring [[Madge Kennedy]] and [[Mabel Normand]]. In August 1918, Goldwyn Pictures signed [[Will Rogers]], at that time a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] Follies favorite, to star in a [[Rex Beach]] production, ''Laughing Bill Hyde'', filmed at the Fort Lee studio for release in September.<ref name=flft/> The company purchased the [[Sony Pictures Studios|Triangle Studios]] in Culver City in 1918.<ref name=flfs/><ref>{{cite web|title=Lot History|url=http://www.sonypicturesmuseum.com/studio/lothistory|website=Sony Picture Museum|publisher=Sony Pictures Entertainment|accessdate=February 5, 2015|page=1|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205172234/http://www.sonypicturesmuseum.com/studio/lothistory|archivedate=February 5, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Goldwyn then headed west out to Culver City in the Winter of 1918 which opening operations there also caused an increase in film expenses.<ref name=flft/> Seeing an opportunity in December, Samuel Goldfish then had his name legally changed to [[Samuel Goldwyn]].\n\nIn 1919, Frank Joseph \"Joe\" Godsol became an investor in Goldwyn Pictures.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Kevin|last2=Lewis|first2=Arnold|date=June\u2013July 1988|title=Include Me out: Samuel Goldwyn and Joe Godsol|journal=Film History|publisher=Indiana University Press|volume=2|issue=2|pages=133\u2013153|jstor=3815031}}</ref>\n\nGoldwyn began looking to follow other film companies, like [[Loews Cineplex Entertainment|Loews Theaters]]/[[Metro Pictures]] and [[First National Pictures|First National]], into vertical integration. Goldwyn and the company backers were looking at renting the [[Astor Theatre, New York City|Astor Theatre]] for movie premiers instead with the [[Capitol Theatre (New York City)|Capitol Theatre]]'s financial problems in May 1920, the backer purchased a controlling interest in that theater.

Published from October 1974 until December 1985, the magazine covered the spectrum of hobbyist/home/personal computing in a more accessible format than the rather technically oriented ''[[Byte (magazine)|BYTE]]''.<ref name=ccomputing>{{cite web|url=http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/serial?id=ccomputing|work=The Online Books Page: Serial Archive Listings|title=Creative Computing|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|location=USA|accessdate=12 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe company also published several books, the most successful being ''[[BASIC Computer Games]]'', the first million-selling computer book. Their ''Best of Creative Computing'' collections were also popular, to the point that they also published the first issue of ''The Best of Byte''.\n\n''Creative Computing'' also published software on [[Compact Cassette (data)|Compact Cassette]] and [[floppy disk]] for the popular computer systems of the time, and had a small hardware business. Both of these were closed when the company was purchased by [[Ziff-Davis]] in 1983.\n\n==History==\n===DEC and Edu===\nPrior to starting ''Creative Computing'', in the early 1970s [[David H. Ahl]] was working in the educational department of [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) where he started publication of their ''Edu'' newsletter in the spring of 1971.{{sfn|Ahl|1976|p=2}} He was surprised to find that the number of subscribers, which reached 20,000 after 18 months, was much larger than the 2,000 or 3,000 he predicted based on the number of DEC machines in educational settings. He found that many subscribers did not have a DEC machine but were using ''Edu'' as a source of general information on computers in educational settings. This began his earliest thoughts about a non-DEC magazine aimed at this market.{{sfn|Anderson|1984|p=70}}\n\nOn 22 February 1973, Ahl was let go during a downsizing at DEC. But before he even received his last paycheck, he was re-hired by a different department to help develop new low-end versions of the DEC [[minicomputer]] line. During this period he collected many user submissions to ''Edu'' and convinced DEC to publish ''101 BASIC Computer Games'' in the summer of 1973.{{sfn|Anderson|1984|p=70}} This was a hit, and eventually ran three publishing runs; July 1973, April 1974, and March 1975.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.ccapitalia.net/descarga/docs/1975-101-basic-computer-games.pdf |title=101 BASIC Computer Games |publisher=DEC |date=March 1975}}</ref>\n\nBy 1974, the team had produced two new designs, a [[PDP-8]] combined with a [[VT50]] terminal, and a briefcase-sized version of the [[PDP-8]] with a small [[floppy disk]]. When these were personally canceled by [[Ken Olsen]] with the statement that \"I can't see any reason that anyone would want a computer of his own\"{{sfn|Anderson|1984|p=70}} Ahl quit DEC and took a position at [[AT&T]].{{sfn|Anderson|1984|p=70}}\n\n===Formation===\nIt was at this point that Ahl decided to move ahead with the educational-focused magazine. Reasoning that the educational market would be of interest to public foundations and many companies, Ahl sent funding proposals to over a hundred companies and received nothing.{{sfn|Ahl|1976|p=2}} Instead, he used his own funds to print 11,000 copies of a flier that he sent to [[Hewlett-Packard]] and other minicomputer vendors, which resulted in 850 subscriptions to a magazine that didn't even exist yet.{{sfn|Ahl|1976|p=2}}{{efn|The later narrative in Anderson puts the number of 600.{{sfn|Anderson|1984|p=70}}}}\n\nInstead of printing 850 copies, Ahl split the subscription money in two, kept one half for future operations, and used the other half to print as many copies of the new magazine as he could. This allowed for the printing of 8,000 copies of the first edition, which were completed on 7 October 1974. The subscribers were sent their copies first, but the rest were sent for free to a wide variety of companies, libraries and schools. He followed the same pattern for the next three issues.{{sfn|Anderson|1984|p=72}} The trick worked, and subscriptions began to pour in.{{sfn|Ahl|1976|p=3}}\n\n===Growth===\nBy August 1975 the magazine had 2,500 subscribers. In January, the [[Altair 8800]] had been announced and Ahl began looking for new authors who could write for the exploding microcomputer market. By 1976 the content was roughly split between the education and microcomputing market. At that point, the magazine started actively looking for advertisers and the November/December 1976 issue was the first to be printed on coated paper rather than [[newsprint]] to provide better quality ads.{{sfn|Anderson|1984|p=72}}\n\nBy 1978 the subscriptions hit 60,000, and revenue was approaching $1 million. In July 1978, Ahl quit his position at AT&T to work at ''Creative Computing'' full time. This caused friction with his wife.{{sfn|Savetz|2013}} In August, they purchased ROM magazine{{efn|Unrelated to the Atari-related publication of a few years later.}} and two smaller newsletters and combined their content into the magazine. In January 1979, the magazine went monthly from bimonthly.{{sfn|Anderson|1984|p=74}}\n\nBy 1979 the magazine had outgrown the single-family home it was being run from, and Ahl looked for a larger duplex home that would allow him to live with his wife in one half and run the magazine from the other. It was at this time that [[Regis McKenna]], the advertizing company handling [[Apple Computer]] was asked to pay an overdue advertising bill. The company provided a canceled check proving they had already done so. When they began tracking it down, the police were called and found that two people in the company had conspired to embezzle $100,000 by sending incoming cheques to a different bank. This was only discovered because one of the conspirators had forgotten to mark the bill as paid.{{sfn|Savetz|2013}}\n\nWhen she was told the story, Ahl's wife had enough and kicked him out of the house pending a [[divorce]]. He moved into the only unused room in the other side of the building. During this time, [[Ted Nelson]], known for the invention of [[hypertext]], was briefly the editor. Nelson would arrive at 5 pm and work all night, waking Ahl in the bedroom when he started printing on a [[Qume]] [[Daisy wheel printing|daisy wheel printer]]. In October 1980 the company moved to a much larger {{convert|25,000|sqft}} office building.{{sfn|Anderson|1984|p=74}}\n\nThrough this period, featured writers included [[Robert Swirsky]], [[David Lubar]], and [[John J. Anderson]]. The magazine regularly included [[BASIC]] [[source code]] for utility programs and games, which users could manually enter into their home computers. The April issues, starting in 1980, became famous for their parodies of the major computer magazines of the time.\n\n===Ziff-Davis===\nLarger publishers began taking note of the computer market. A watershed moment was in 1979 when [[McGraw-Hill]] purchased ''[[Byte magazine|Byte]]''. By 1982, most of the quality magazines had been purchased and only a few large ones remained independent, including ''[[Compute!]]'', ''[[Interface Age]]'', ''[[Family Computing]]''{{efn|Although Ahl mentions Family Computing in an interview,{{sfn|Savetz|2013}} this magazine actually started publication in 1983, so it is likely he has confused the name.}} and ''Creative Computing''.{{sfn|Savetz|2013}}\n\nRealizing they were being pushed out of the market due to the huge budgets and marketing power of these major players, in 1982 Ahl approached several potential buyers, including [[Atari]], [[CBS]]{{efn|CBS ran a magazine division at the time.{{sfn|Savetz|2013}}}} and [[Ziff-Davis]].{{sfn|Savetz|2013}} In 1983 Ahl sold the company to [[Ziff-Davis]], which at that time published 28 different magazines. Ahl remained the Editor-in-Chief.{{sfn|Anderson|1984|p=74}}<ref name=hmc/> At their peak, the magazine reached about 500,000 subscriptions.{{sfn|Savetz|2013}}\n\nThrough the early 1980s, and especially with the launch of the [[IBM PC]], the market began to shift from a hobby-and-educational oriented one to more and more business applications. Ziff quickly shifted the focus of the magazine to be more software-oriented, and the programming articles disappeared shortly after the sale. This attempt to refocus on business computing was not successful, and when [[William Bernard Ziff Jr.|Bill Ziff]] had a cancer scare in 1985 he began concentrating his businesses, selling off many of the specialty magazines. Ziff ultimately ceased publication of ''Creative Computing'' in December 1985.<ref name=hmc>{{cite news|author=Harry McCracken|title=The Twelve Greatest Defunct Tech Magazines Ever|url=http://www.technologizer.com/2008/11/20/the-twelve-greatest-defunct-tech-magazines-ever/|accessdate=3 August 2015|work=Technologizer|date=20 November 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Other magazines==\nThe company also began publication of several other magazines at different times, but none of these were very successful and tended to have very short production runs.{{sfn|Savetz|2013}} Among these were ''Small Business Computing'', ''Sync Magazine'' for the [[ZX81]], ''Video and Arcade Games''.{{sfn|Savetz|2013}}\n\n==Books==\nThe company also published several books. Among these were three volumes of ''The Best of Creative Computing Magazine'' (Creative Computing Press) in 1976, 1977, and 1980, respectively. The cover of volume 2 was illustrated by famed underground cartoonist [[Gilbert Shelton]].\n\nMuch more famous is an updated version of ''101'' that had been ported to [[Microsoft BASIC]]. Released in 1978, ''[[BASIC Computer Games]]'' was an instant hit in the expanding microcomputer world, and became the first million-selling computer book.{{sfn|Anderson|1984|p=72}} This was followed by ''More BASIC Computer Games''.\n\nThey also published the first ''The Best of Byte'' collection, in spite of being friendly competitors with ''Byte''. The relationship ended with the McGraw-Hill purchase.{{sfn|Savetz|2013}}\n\n==Software==\n[[File:Action and bumping games.jpg|thumb|Box art style used by Creative Computing Software]]\nA number of home computer games were published under the '''Sensational Software''' banner, also known as '''Creative Computing Software'''.

Published from October 1974 until December 1985, the magazine covered the spectrum of hobbyist/home/personal computing in a more accessible format than the rather technically oriented ''[[Byte (magazine)|BYTE]]''.<ref name=ccomputing>{{cite web|url=http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/serial?id=ccomputing|work=The Online Books Page: Serial Archive Listings|title=Creative Computing|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|location=USA|accessdate=12 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe company also published several books, the most successful being ''[[BASIC Computer Games]]'', the first million-selling computer book. Their ''Best of Creative Computing'' collections were also popular, to the point that they also published the first issue of ''The Best of Byte''.\n\n''Creative Computing'' also published software on [[Compact Cassette (data)|Compact Cassette]] and [[floppy disk]] for the popular computer systems of the time, and had a small hardware business.

Ahl]] was working in the educational department of [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) where he started publication of their ''Edu'' newsletter in the spring of 1971.{{sfn|Ahl|1976|p=2}} He was surprised to find that the number of subscribers, which reached 20,000 after 18 months, was much larger than the 2,000 or 3,000 he predicted based on the number of DEC machines in educational settings. He found that many subscribers did not have a DEC machine but were using ''Edu'' as a source of general information on computers in educational settings. This began his earliest thoughts about a non-DEC magazine aimed at this market.{{sfn|Anderson|1984|p=70}}\n\nOn 22 February 1973, Ahl was let go during a downsizing at DEC. But before he even received his last paycheck, he was re-hired by a different department to help develop new low-end versions of the DEC [[minicomputer]] line. During this period he collected many user submissions to ''Edu'' and convinced DEC to publish ''101 BASIC Computer Games'' in the summer of 1973.{{sfn|Anderson|1984|p=70}} This was a hit, and eventually ran three publishing runs; July 1973, April 1974, and March 1975.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.ccapitalia.net/descarga/docs/1975-101-basic-computer-games.pdf |title=101 BASIC Computer Games |publisher=DEC |date=March 1975}}</ref>\n\nBy 1974, the team had produced two new designs, a [[PDP-8]] combined with a [[VT50]] terminal, and a briefcase-sized version of the [[PDP-8]] with a small [[floppy disk]].
