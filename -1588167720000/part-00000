Hundreds of mostly [[working-class]] rioters rampaged through Boston, paralyzed the provincial government, and captured several naval officers and the sheriff's deputy. After Knowles threatened to bombard the town, the British governor of Boston, [[William Shirley]], persuaded him to release the Bostonians in exchange for the hostages.\n\nThe Knowles Riot was the largest impressment riot in North America, and the most serious uprising by the American colonists in Colonial America prior to the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] protests of 1765.<ref>Brunsman (2007), p. 328.</ref> A few days after the incident, an anonymous writer\u2014probably [[Samuel Adams]]\u2014published a pamphlet praising the rioters for defending their [[natural rights]]. This was the first time the ideas of [[John Locke]] were used to justify resistance to the authority of the Crown in the American colonies.<ref>Pencak (2011), p. 107.</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Background ===\nDuring the War of the Austrian Succession, the [[Royal Navy]] again expanded its domestic use of impressment: the practice of forcing men, usually merchant seamen, into naval service. A captain who found himself shorthanded would send a \"press-gang,\" armed with [[cudgels]] and [[cutlasses]], onto a merchant ship to capture sailors for his own crew, often with the cooperation of local authorities. Those who were impressed remained in the service for three years or until they escaped, died, or the current war ended. Naturally they resented this treatment, for the same reasons that made recruiting difficult in the first place: the work was hard and dangerous, and for skilled sailors especially, the wages were low. Sometimes they resisted, and several riot ensued in England over impressment.<ref>Brunsman (2007), pp. 329, 331.</ref>\n\nIn the continental American colonies, British law governing impressment had been different and became subject to dispute; by the Trade to America Act 1707 (6 Ann. c. 64 s. 9) Parliament had exempted those in the American colonies from impressment,<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/pp63095177#page/n859/mode/2up ''An Act for the Encouragement of the Trade to America.''], p.804]</ref> but it later claimed that the exemption had been a temporary measure during [[Queen Anne's War|that war]]. During [[King George's War]] a similar ban on impressment in the West Indies was enacted by the Sugar Trade Act 1745 (19 Geo. 2 c. 30), but with exceptions in the last section<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge01britgoog#page/n514 ''An act for the better encouragement of the trade of his Majesty's sugar colonies in America.''], p.472</ref> it caused further confusion and controversy. As a result, American colonists who resisted impressment often believed that they were within their legal rights to do so. Boston seamen were particularly insistent on this point, for a number of reasons. Many of them had taken part in the [[Siege of Louisbourg (1745)|Siege of Louisbourg]], and in return for their service had been promised by [[Peter Warren (Royal Navy officer)|Commodore Peter Warren]] of the Royal Navy that they would not be impressed. Furthermore, because Boston depended on its seamen to transport food and fuel to the city, Governor Shirley made a point when issuing impressment warrants of limiting them to non-residents of Massachusetts on inbound vessels. Outbound vessels, fishing vessels, and [[Coastal trading vessel|coasters]] were strictly off limits.<ref>Tager (2001), p. 57.</ref>\n\nIn November 1745, a press-gang killed two sailors\u2014both veterans of Louisbourg\u2014during a struggle in a Boston boardinghouse. Two of the killers were caught and sentenced to death by hanging, but the verdict was found to be invalid by the Crown and overturned<ref>Tager (2001), p. 63.</ref> The incident destroyed whatever goodwill the navy may have had in Boston, and set the stage for a violent uprising. As historian John Noble put it, \"the temper of the town was quite ready for such an outbreak.\"<ref>Brunsman (2007), p. 353; Noble (1897), p. 8.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1740s, Admiral Charles Knowles<ref group=\"note\">Several sources refer to Knowles as a [[Commodore (rank)|commodore]]. He attained the rank of commodore in 1742 and was promoted to [[rear admiral]] in 1747. See Brunsman (2007), p. 333, and Lee (1892), p. 292.</ref> provoked some of the largest impressment riots in the history of Britain's American and Caribbean colonies. Knowles had a habit of disregarding local laws and customs when pressing men into service on his warships. In 1743, for example, he provoked a violent conflict in Antigua when he captured crewmen from a [[privateer]] ship, a drastic measure normally reserved for national emergencies.<ref>Brunsman (2007), pp. 343\u2013344.</ref>\n\nIn the fall of 1747, a [[Squadron (naval)|squadron]] under Knowles's command was anchored at [[Nantasket Beach|Nantasket]]<ref>Brunsman (2007), p. 356.</ref> in [[Boston Harbor]], being repaired and restocked in preparation for a trip to the West Indies. Desperately in need of personnel, Knowles flouted tradition when he sent press-gangs to round up sailors in the harbor and along the waterfront without first obtaining a warrant from Governor Shirley. Knowles had been repeatedly warned by Commodore Warren to \"shew what Lenity you can...to the people of those Colonys\" and \"to give them no room for complaints.\" Nevertheless, on the evening of November 16, 1747, and into the next morning, Knowles's press-gangs captured some 46 men, treating them roughly and ignoring their protests that they were Massachusetts residents.<ref>Brunsman (2007), pp. 351\u2013354.</ref> Not all were on inbound ships, and some were not even seamen, but carpenters and laborers on their way to work.<ref>Tager (2001), pp. 52\u201353.</ref> One outbound ship, the ''Mercury'', was left almost completely unattended when 16 of its 19 crewmen were taken, and sustained serious damage as a result.<ref>Lax (1976), p. 185.</ref>\n\n=== Confrontation at the Governor's mansion ===\nOn the morning of November 17, a mob of about 300 locals, wielding cutlasses and clubs, captured a lieutenant of the ''Lark'' in retaliation for what they considered an illegal press. Attempting to free the officers, the sheriff of [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk County]], Benjamin Pollard, arrested two of the rioters. The sheriff and his deputies often assisted the navy's press-gangs, which did little to endear them to the townspeople. The mob attacked the sheriff, forcing him to release his two prisoners, and taking one of his deputies as a hostage. One witness wrote later that the sheriff \"was glad to get off with a Broken Head, tho' he was in danger of losing it.\" [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]], then the Speaker of the House and an outspoken critic of impressment, managed to persuade the mob to release the lieutenant, who had not been part of the press-gang, and brought him to the governor's mansion for safekeeping. Upon hearing what had happened, Governor Shirley called for the militia to \"suppress the Mob by force, and, if need was, to fire upon 'em with Ball.\"<ref>Lax (1976), pp. 186\u2013187; Tager (2001), p. 66.</ref>\n\nNo sooner had he given this order than the angry mob appeared at his front door with three more naval officers and Knowles's servant as hostages. Armed with a cutlass, a spokesman for the mob accused Shirley of having issued an illegal impressment warrant. Shirley denied the charge and called the man an \"Impudent Rascal\"; his son-in-law, William Bollen, knocked the man's hat off. Shirley claimed there were seven or eight armed officers in the house who were \"ready to stand upon their Defence, in case the Mob should be so outrageous, as to attempt to break into the House.\" He then escorted the officers into the house while Hutchinson calmed the crowd and persuaded them not to follow.<ref>Lax (1976), p. 187; Tager (2001), p. 67.</ref>\n\nThe rioters still had one hostage: the sheriff's deputy, whom they beat in the governor's courtyard, and put in [[stocks]].<ref name=\"tager67\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=Yq74VlJNyQoC&pg=PA67 Tager (2001), p. 67.]</ref> After the mob left, the governor headed to the Town House at the corner of [[King Street (Boston, Massachusetts)|King]] and [[Washington Street (Boston)#History|Cornhill]] Streets, which was home to the [[Massachusetts General Court]]. Upstairs in the Council chamber, he spoke with members about his plans for dispersing the mob and offering rewards for informants.<ref name=\"tager67\" />\n\n=== Storming of the Town House ===\nThe House of Representatives, which met on the first floor of the Town House, assembled that day to discuss the incident. House records suggest that they were sympathetic to the rioters, \"inasmuch as it hath been represented to this House, that sundry Inhabitants of this Province have been taken from their lawful Employments, and forcibly carried on board his Majesty's Ships of War.\" As dusk fell, they adjourned. They had probably been informed that the mob was on its way, and left without warning the others so that the townspeople could present their demands directly to the governor and the Council. Only Hutchinson and a few other representatives went upstairs to confer with the governor.<ref>Lax, (1976), pp. 187\u2013189.</ref>\n\nMinutes later, an angry mob surrounded the Town House, breaking all the first-floor windows with stones and [[wikt:brickbat|brickbats]] and forcing their way in. The exact nature of the crowd has been the subject of some debate. Town officials claimed that \"the said Riotous Tumultuous Assembly consisted of Foreign Seamen, Servants, Negros & other Persons of mean & vile condition.\" Some historians believe this was an effort to deflect blame,<ref>Brunsman (2007), p. 363.</ref> while others treat it as fact.<ref>Hardesty (2016), pp. 128\u2013129.</ref> Hutchinson estimated the crowd's size at \"several thousand,\" remarkable in a city with a population of just 16,000. In addition to sailors and other maritime workers, the crowd likely included most of Boston's militia, as well as some middle-class shopkeepers and merchants, women, and others whose lives were affected by impressment.<ref>Brunsman (2007), p. 360.</ref>\n\nSeveral militia officers who were assembled on the first floor were forced up a narrow staircase into the Council Chamber, creating a bottleneck which halted the mob's progress and gave the governor a chance to address them. At Hutchinson's urging, Shirley promised he would do his best to obtain the release of the impressed men. The rioters were not satisfied. A spokesman came forward and demanded to know why the men convicted in the press-gang killings of 1745 had not been executed. The governor explained that the execution had been suspended by order of the king. The spokesman then issued a thinly veiled threat, asking Shirley if he remembered the [[Porteous Riots]] in Edinburgh, in which the Captain of the City Guards had been \"hang'd upon a sign post.\" Shirley replied that he remembered it well, and that he \"hop'd they remember'd what the Consequence of that proceeding was to the Inhabitants of the City,\" another not-so-subtle threat of violence.<ref>Lax (1976), p. 189; Tager (2001), p. 69.</ref>\n\nPromising to return the next day, the crowd left the Town House, but continued rioting through the night. In a symbolic gesture, they dragged a barge onto [[Boston Common]] and burned it, believing it to be the property of the navy.<ref>Brunsman (2007), p. 359.</ref> Afterwards, they split up into groups to find more hostages. Rioters broke into the naval hospital and raided the homes of several residents, taking four or five petty officers hostage. Meanwhile, Shirley helped smuggle some of Knowles's officers out of town and onto a barge that carried them safely back to the fleet.<ref>Lax (1976), pp. 190, 192; Tager (2001), p. 70.</ref>\n\n=== Governor's flight to Castle William ===\nDespite the governor's call for two regiments of militia, only the officers reported for duty that night. The rest, in all likelihood, had joined the rioting mob. Without the militia to enforce the rule of law, Boston effectively had no functioning government. Suspecting that the insurrection was \"secretly countenens'd and encourag'd by some ill-minded Inhabitants, and Persons of Influence in the Town,\" Governor Shirley fled to [[Castle William]], a fort on Castle Island in Boston Harbor, hoping to enlist the aid of neighboring regiments to quell the disorder.<ref name=\"tager71\">Lax (1976), pp. 190\u2013191; Tager (2001),p. 71.</ref>\n\nOnce there, Shirley was better able to communicate with Knowles, who was aboard the H.M.S. ''Canterbury''. In a letter, he informed Knowles of the riots and asked him to release the impressed Bostonians. Instead, Knowles threatened to bring up his warships and bombard Boston. Witnesses on the ''Canterbury'' later reported that Knowles appeared to have every intention of carrying through on his threat. One mariner heard Knowles tell the gunnery officer to load 24 guns, declaring, \"By God I'll now see if the King's Government is not as good as a Mob!\"<ref name=\"tager71\" /> Joseph Ballard, a Boston carpenter who was making repairs on the ''Canterbury'', begged Knowles to reconsider:\n\n<blockquote>I replyed Oh! how will that do, Sir the Righteous will suffer with the Wicked. how will you find out the Rebels he Answered the North End people were the Rebels. I told him I should suffer then for I lived there he replyed no, no I'll take care of that I will punish ye guilty I told him he must be very curious in throwing his Shot then...<ref>Noble (1897), p. 24.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn an exchange of letters, Shirley managed to talk Knowles out of razing the [[North End, Boston|North End]]. On the morning of the 19th, he wrote to the General Court to let them know that Knowles was unwilling to release the impressed men as long as his own officers were being held. He added that he would be dining with Knowles later that day, and asked them to persuade the townspeople to stop the riot, promising that it was within his power \"to set all things right\" with their assistance. That day the General Court adopted a series of resolutions condemning the riots, instructing the militia of its duty to maintain order, ordering the release of the hostages, and urging the governor to promise the townspeople \"that all due care shall be taken for maintaining their just rights and Liberties, and for redressing all and every Grievance.\"<ref>Lax (1976), pp. 193\u2013194; Tager (2001), p. 73.</ref> By the end of the next day the militia had turned out, the mob had dispersed, the hostages had returned to their ships, and the impressed Massachusetts residents had been freed.<ref>Brunsman (2007), p. 357.</ref><ref group=\"note\">According to at least one other source, Knowles did not release his prisoners until the 21st. See Lax (1976), p. 196.</ref> Knowles and his squadron sailed for the West Indies on November 30, \"to the joy of the rest of the town.\"<ref>Lax (1976), p. 196.</ref>\n\n=== Aftermath ===\nIn the course of the riots, eleven men were arrested: five sailors, four laborers, a bookkeeper, and a carpenter. Three of them were fined, and the rest were acquitted. The General Court passed several more resolutions for appearances' sake, condemning the riots and offering a reward for the ringleaders.<ref>Tager (2001), p. 74.</ref>\n\nA few days after the riot, a pamphlet about the incident was published under the pseudonym Amicus Patrie (\"a friend of the country\"). The author, thought by some historians to have been a young [[Samuel Adams]] (a cousin of the future second U.S. President [[John Adams]]), used Lockean reasoning to defend the rioters, arguing that they had a natural right to resist impressment: \"For when they are suddenly attack'd, without the least Warning, and by they know not whom; I think they are treated as in a State of Nature, and have a natural Right, to treat their Oppressors, as under such Circumstances.\" This was the first time a natural rights argument was used to justify resistance to the authority of the Crown by American colonists, which was beginning to be perceived as foreign and tyrannical. Thus the Knowles Riot indirectly contributed to political ideas and arguments that were used in the [[American Revolutionary War]], thirty years later.<ref>Brunsman (2007), pp. 363\u2013364; Lax (1976), p. 214.</ref>\n\nIn December of that year, a physician named [[William Douglass (physician)|William Douglass]], known for writing polemical pamphlets, published a history of the American colonies in which he attacked Knowles:\n\n<blockquote>Mr Knowles as a sea Commander perhaps may be noted in the future history of our colony for his unprecedented arrogance by insulting the governments & distressing of trade. He is of obscure parentage, in his youth served aboard the navy in the meanest stations, & from some unaccountable whim or humour of some of the officers (thus some ladies take a liking or fancy to a monkey, lapdog or parrot)...he is arrived to be a warrant Commodore in America, where like a beggar on horseback he rides unmercifully...hated by the common sailors, & not beloved by his best officers; laboriously indefatigable in running to & fro, & in expending of paper, true symptoms of madness.<ref>Douglass, quoted in Noble (1897), p. 16.</ref></blockquote>\n\nKnowles sued Douglass for libel and was awarded \u00a3750. When Douglass appealed, Knowles contended that the only problem with the original judgment was that it should have been for \u00a310,000, and therefore he was suing Douglass again, this time for \u00a39,250. The superior court ruled in favor of Douglass.<ref>Noble (1897), p. 22.</ref>\n\nThe incident seems to have made a lasting impression on Knowles. The following year in Jamaica he was much more cautious, advertising for recruits, offering financial incentives, and consulting with local authorities before resorting to impressment. In 1758, an anonymous pamphlet attributed to Knowles proposed a plan to solve the navy's recruiting problem by building hundreds of free houses for navy men and their families in Massachusetts. If implemented, the plan would have dramatically reduced the navy's dependence on impressment.<ref>Brunsman (2007), pp. 365\u2013366.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[War of Jenkins' Ear]]\n* [[King George's War]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist |group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite journal |first1=Denver |last1=Brunsman |title=The Knowles Atlantic Impressment Riots of the 1740s |journal=[[Early American Studies]] |volume=5 |issue=2 |date=2007 |pages=324\u2013366 |jstor=23546612}}\n* {{cite book |first1=Jared R. |last1=Hardesty |title=Unfreedom: Slavery and Dependence in Eighteenth-Century Boston |publisher=[[NYU Press]] |date=2016 |isbn=9781479872176 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zArMCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA128}}\n* {{cite journal |first1=John |last1=Lax |first2=William |last2=Pencak |title=The Knowles Riot and the Crisis of the 1740s in Massachusetts |journal=Perspectives in American History |volume=10 |date=1976 |pages=163\u2013216}}\n* {{cite book |first1=John |last1=Noble |title=The Libel Suit of Knowles v.

See Brunsman (2007), p. 333, and Lee (1892), p. 292.</ref> provoked some of the largest impressment riots in the history of Britain's American and Caribbean colonies. Knowles had a habit of disregarding local laws and customs when pressing men into service on his warships. In 1743, for example, he provoked a violent conflict in Antigua when he captured crewmen from a [[privateer]] ship, a drastic measure normally reserved for national emergencies.<ref>Brunsman (2007), pp. 343\u2013344.</ref>\n\nIn the fall of 1747, a [[Squadron (naval)|squadron]] under Knowles's command was anchored at [[Nantasket Beach|Nantasket]]<ref>Brunsman (2007), p. 356.</ref> in [[Boston Harbor]], being repaired and restocked in preparation for a trip to the West Indies. Desperately in need of personnel, Knowles flouted tradition when he sent press-gangs to round up sailors in the harbor and along the waterfront without first obtaining a warrant from Governor Shirley. Knowles had been repeatedly warned by Commodore Warren to \"shew what Lenity you can...to the people of those Colonys\" and \"to give them no room for complaints.\" Nevertheless, on the evening of November 16, 1747, and into the next morning, Knowles's press-gangs captured some 46 men, treating them roughly and ignoring their protests that they were Massachusetts residents.<ref>Brunsman (2007), pp. 351\u2013354.</ref> Not all were on inbound ships, and some were not even seamen, but carpenters and laborers on their way to work.<ref>Tager (2001), pp. 52\u201353.</ref> One outbound ship, the ''Mercury'', was left almost completely unattended when 16 of its 19 crewmen were taken, and sustained serious damage as a result.<ref>Lax (1976), p. 185.</ref>\n\n=== Confrontation at the Governor's mansion ===\nOn the morning of November 17, a mob of about 300 locals, wielding cutlasses and clubs, captured a lieutenant of the ''Lark'' in retaliation for what they considered an illegal press. Attempting to free the officers, the sheriff of [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk County]], Benjamin Pollard, arrested two of the rioters. The sheriff and his deputies often assisted the navy's press-gangs, which did little to endear them to the townspeople. The mob attacked the sheriff, forcing him to release his two prisoners, and taking one of his deputies as a hostage. One witness wrote later that the sheriff \"was glad to get off with a Broken Head, tho' he was in danger of losing it.\" [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]], then the Speaker of the House and an outspoken critic of impressment, managed to persuade the mob to release the lieutenant, who had not been part of the press-gang, and brought him to the governor's mansion for safekeeping. Upon hearing what had happened, Governor Shirley called for the militia to \"suppress the Mob by force, and, if need was, to fire upon 'em with Ball.\"<ref>Lax (1976), pp. 186\u2013187; Tager (2001), p. 66.</ref>\n\nNo sooner had he given this order than the angry mob appeared at his front door with three more naval officers and Knowles's servant as hostages. Armed with a cutlass, a spokesman for the mob accused Shirley of having issued an illegal impressment warrant. Shirley denied the charge and called the man an \"Impudent Rascal\"; his son-in-law, William Bollen, knocked the man's hat off. Shirley claimed there were seven or eight armed officers in the house who were \"ready to stand upon their Defence, in case the Mob should be so outrageous, as to attempt to break into the House.\" He then escorted the officers into the house while Hutchinson calmed the crowd and persuaded them not to follow.<ref>Lax (1976), p. 187; Tager (2001), p. 67.</ref>\n\nThe rioters still had one hostage: the sheriff's deputy, whom they beat in the governor's courtyard, and put in [[stocks]].<ref name=\"tager67\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=Yq74VlJNyQoC&pg=PA67 Tager (2001), p. 67.]</ref> After the mob left, the governor headed to the Town House at the corner of [[King Street (Boston, Massachusetts)|King]] and [[Washington Street (Boston)#History|Cornhill]] Streets, which was home to the [[Massachusetts General Court]]. Upstairs in the Council chamber, he spoke with members about his plans for dispersing the mob and offering rewards for informants.<ref name=\"tager67\" />\n\n=== Storming of the Town House ===\nThe House of Representatives, which met on the first floor of the Town House, assembled that day to discuss the incident. House records suggest that they were sympathetic to the rioters, \"inasmuch as it hath been represented to this House, that sundry Inhabitants of this Province have been taken from their lawful Employments, and forcibly carried on board his Majesty's Ships of War.\" As dusk fell, they adjourned. They had probably been informed that the mob was on its way, and left without warning the others so that the townspeople could present their demands directly to the governor and the Council. Only Hutchinson and a few other representatives went upstairs to confer with the governor.<ref>Lax, (1976), pp. 187\u2013189.</ref>\n\nMinutes later, an angry mob surrounded the Town House, breaking all the first-floor windows with stones and [[wikt:brickbat|brickbats]] and forcing their way in. The exact nature of the crowd has been the subject of some debate. Town officials claimed that \"the said Riotous Tumultuous Assembly consisted of Foreign Seamen, Servants, Negros & other Persons of mean & vile condition.\" Some historians believe this was an effort to deflect blame,<ref>Brunsman (2007), p. 363.</ref> while others treat it as fact.<ref>Hardesty (2016), pp. 128\u2013129.</ref> Hutchinson estimated the crowd's size at \"several thousand,\" remarkable in a city with a population of just 16,000. In addition to sailors and other maritime workers, the crowd likely included most of Boston's militia, as well as some middle-class shopkeepers and merchants, women, and others whose lives were affected by impressment.<ref>Brunsman (2007), p. 360.</ref>\n\nSeveral militia officers who were assembled on the first floor were forced up a narrow staircase into the Council Chamber, creating a bottleneck which halted the mob's progress and gave the governor a chance to address them. At Hutchinson's urging, Shirley promised he would do his best to obtain the release of the impressed men. The rioters were not satisfied. A spokesman came forward and demanded to know why the men convicted in the press-gang killings of 1745 had not been executed. The governor explained that the execution had been suspended by order of the king. The spokesman then issued a thinly veiled threat, asking Shirley if he remembered the [[Porteous Riots]] in Edinburgh, in which the Captain of the City Guards had been \"hang'd upon a sign post.\" Shirley replied that he remembered it well, and that he \"hop'd they remember'd what the Consequence of that proceeding was to the Inhabitants of the City,\" another not-so-subtle threat of violence.<ref>Lax (1976), p. 189; Tager (2001), p. 69.</ref>\n\nPromising to return the next day, the crowd left the Town House, but continued rioting through the night. In a symbolic gesture, they dragged a barge onto [[Boston Common]] and burned it, believing it to be the property of the navy.<ref>Brunsman (2007), p. 359.</ref> Afterwards, they split up into groups to find more hostages. Rioters broke into the naval hospital and raided the homes of several residents, taking four or five petty officers hostage. Meanwhile, Shirley helped smuggle some of Knowles's officers out of town and onto a barge that carried them safely back to the fleet.<ref>Lax (1976), pp. 190, 192; Tager (2001), p. 70.</ref>\n\n=== Governor's flight to Castle William ===\nDespite the governor's call for two regiments of militia, only the officers reported for duty that night. The rest, in all likelihood, had joined the rioting mob. Without the militia to enforce the rule of law, Boston effectively had no functioning government. Suspecting that the insurrection was \"secretly countenens'd and encourag'd by some ill-minded Inhabitants, and Persons of Influence in the Town,\" Governor Shirley fled to [[Castle William]], a fort on Castle Island in Boston Harbor, hoping to enlist the aid of neighboring regiments to quell the disorder.<ref name=\"tager71\">Lax (1976), pp. 190\u2013191; Tager (2001),p. 71.</ref>\n\nOnce there, Shirley was better able to communicate with Knowles, who was aboard the H.M.S. ''Canterbury''. In a letter, he informed Knowles of the riots and asked him to release the impressed Bostonians. Instead, Knowles threatened to bring up his warships and bombard Boston. Witnesses on the ''Canterbury'' later reported that Knowles appeared to have every intention of carrying through on his threat. One mariner heard Knowles tell the gunnery officer to load 24 guns, declaring, \"By God I'll now see if the King's Government is not as good as a Mob!\"<ref name=\"tager71\" /> Joseph Ballard, a Boston carpenter who was making repairs on the ''Canterbury'', begged Knowles to reconsider:\n\n<blockquote>I replyed Oh! how will that do, Sir the Righteous will suffer with the Wicked. how will you find out the Rebels he Answered the North End people were the Rebels. I told him I should suffer then for I lived there he replyed no, no I'll take care of that I will punish ye guilty I told him he must be very curious in throwing his Shot then...<ref>Noble (1897), p. 24.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn an exchange of letters, Shirley managed to talk Knowles out of razing the [[North End, Boston|North End]]. On the morning of the 19th, he wrote to the General Court to let them know that Knowles was unwilling to release the impressed men as long as his own officers were being held. He added that he would be dining with Knowles later that day, and asked them to persuade the townspeople to stop the riot, promising that it was within his power \"to set all things right\" with their assistance. That day the General Court adopted a series of resolutions condemning the riots, instructing the militia of its duty to maintain order, ordering the release of the hostages, and urging the governor to promise the townspeople \"that all due care shall be taken for maintaining their just rights and Liberties, and for redressing all and every Grievance.\"<ref>Lax (1976), pp. 193\u2013194; Tager (2001), p. 73.</ref> By the end of the next day the militia had turned out, the mob had dispersed, the hostages had returned to their ships, and the impressed Massachusetts residents had been freed.<ref>Brunsman (2007), p. 357.</ref><ref group=\"note\">According to at least one other source, Knowles did not release his prisoners until the 21st. See Lax (1976), p. 196.</ref> Knowles and his squadron sailed for the West Indies on November 30, \"to the joy of the rest of the town.\"<ref>Lax (1976), p. 196.</ref>\n\n=== Aftermath ===\nIn the course of the riots, eleven men were arrested: five sailors, four laborers, a bookkeeper, and a carpenter. Three of them were fined, and the rest were acquitted. The General Court passed several more resolutions for appearances' sake, condemning the riots and offering a reward for the ringleaders.<ref>Tager (2001), p. 74.</ref>\n\nA few days after the riot, a pamphlet about the incident was published under the pseudonym Amicus Patrie (\"a friend of the country\"). The author, thought by some historians to have been a young [[Samuel Adams]] (a cousin of the future second U.S. President [[John Adams]]), used Lockean reasoning to defend the rioters, arguing that they had a natural right to resist impressment: \"For when they are suddenly attack'd, without the least Warning, and by they know not whom; I think they are treated as in a State of Nature, and have a natural Right, to treat their Oppressors, as under such Circumstances.\" This was the first time a natural rights argument was used to justify resistance to the authority of the Crown by American colonists, which was beginning to be perceived as foreign and tyrannical. Thus the Knowles Riot indirectly contributed to political ideas and arguments that were used in the [[American Revolutionary War]], thirty years later.<ref>Brunsman (2007), pp. 363\u2013364; Lax (1976), p. 214.</ref>\n\nIn December of that year, a physician named [[William Douglass (physician)|William Douglass]], known for writing polemical pamphlets, published a history of the American colonies in which he attacked Knowles:\n\n<blockquote>Mr Knowles as a sea Commander perhaps may be noted in the future history of our colony for his unprecedented arrogance by insulting the governments & distressing of trade. He is of obscure parentage, in his youth served aboard the navy in the meanest stations, & from some unaccountable whim or humour of some of the officers (thus some ladies take a liking or fancy to a monkey, lapdog or parrot)...he is arrived to be a warrant Commodore in America, where like a beggar on horseback he rides unmercifully...hated by the common sailors, & not beloved by his best officers; laboriously indefatigable in running to & fro, & in expending of paper, true symptoms of madness.<ref>Douglass, quoted in Noble (1897), p. 16.</ref></blockquote>\n\nKnowles sued Douglass for libel and was awarded \u00a3750. When Douglass appealed, Knowles contended that the only problem with the original judgment was that it should have been for \u00a310,000, and therefore he was suing Douglass again, this time for \u00a39,250. The superior court ruled in favor of Douglass.<ref>Noble (1897), p. 22.</ref>\n\nThe incident seems to have made a lasting impression on Knowles. The following year in Jamaica he was much more cautious, advertising for recruits, offering financial incentives, and consulting with local authorities before resorting to impressment. In 1758, an anonymous pamphlet attributed to Knowles proposed a plan to solve the navy's recruiting problem by building hundreds of free houses for navy men and their families in Massachusetts. If implemented, the plan would have dramatically reduced the navy's dependence on impressment.<ref>Brunsman (2007), pp. 365\u2013366.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[War of Jenkins' Ear]]\n* [[King George's War]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist |group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite journal |first1=Denver |last1=Brunsman |title=The Knowles Atlantic Impressment Riots of the 1740s |journal=[[Early American Studies]] |volume=5 |issue=2 |date=2007 |pages=324\u2013366 |jstor=23546612}}\n* {{cite book |first1=Jared R. |last1=Hardesty |title=Unfreedom: Slavery and Dependence in Eighteenth-Century Boston |publisher=[[NYU Press]] |date=2016 |isbn=9781479872176 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zArMCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA128}}\n* {{cite journal |first1=John |last1=Lax |first2=William |last2=Pencak |title=The Knowles Riot and the Crisis of the 1740s in Massachusetts |journal=Perspectives in American History |volume=10 |date=1976 |pages=163\u2013216}}\n* {{cite book |first1=John |last1=Noble |title=The Libel Suit of Knowles v.

{"title_page": "Artificial photosynthesis", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2012}}\n\n'''Artificial photosynthesis''' is a [[chemical process]] that [[biomimetics|biomimics]] the natural process of [[photosynthesis]] to convert [[sunlight]], [[water]], and [[carbon dioxide]] into [[carbohydrates]] and [[oxygen]]. The term artificial photosynthesis is commonly used to refer to any scheme for capturing and storing the energy from sunlight in the chemical bonds of a fuel (a [[solar fuel]]). [[Photocatalytic water splitting]] converts water into [[hydrogen]] and oxygen and is a major research topic of artificial photosynthesis. [[Photochemical carbon dioxide reduction|Light-driven carbon dioxide reduction]] is another process studied that replicates natural [[carbon fixation]].\n\nResearch of this topic includes the design and assembly of devices for the direct production of solar fuels, [[photoelectrochemistry]] and its application in fuel cells, and the engineering of [[enzyme]]s and [[photoautotrophic]] [[microorganism]]s for microbial [[biofuel]] and [[biohydrogen]] production from sunlight.\n\n== Overview ==\nThe photosynthetic reaction can be divided into two [[half-reaction]]s of [[redox|oxidation and reduction]], both of which are essential to producing [[fuel]]. In plant photosynthesis, water molecules are photo-oxidized to release oxygen and protons. The second phase of plant photosynthesis (also known as the [[Calvin-Benson cycle]]) is a [[light-independent reaction]] that converts carbon dioxide into [[glucose]] (fuel). Researchers of artificial photosynthesis are developing [[photocatalyst]]s that are able to perform both of these reactions. Furthermore, the protons resulting from water splitting can be used for hydrogen production.

Electrons flow from D to A when catalysis occurs.]]\n\nUsing [[biomimetic]] approaches, artificial photosynthesis tries to construct systems doing the same type of processes. Ideally, a [[Catalytic triad|triad]] assembly could oxidize water with one catalyst, reduce protons with another and have a [[photosensitizer]] molecule to power the whole system. One of the simplest designs is where the photosensitizer is linked in tandem between a water oxidation catalyst and a hydrogen evolving catalyst:\n* The photosensitizer transfers electrons to the hydrogen catalyst when hit by light, becoming oxidized in the process.\n* This drives the water splitting catalyst to donate electrons to the photosensitizer. In a triad assembly, such a catalyst is often referred to as a donor. The oxidized donor is able to perform water oxidation.\nThe state of the triad with one catalyst oxidized on one end and the second one reduced on the other end of the triad is referred to as a charge separation, and is a driving force for further electron transfer, and consequently catalysis, to occur. The different components may be assembled in diverse ways, such as [[supramolecular]] complexes, compartmentalized cells, or linearly, [[covalent]]ly linked molecules.<ref name=Andreiadis/>\n\nResearch into finding catalysts that can convert water, carbon dioxide, and sunlight to carbohydrates or hydrogen is a current, active field.

[[nitrogen fixation|Nitrogen-fixing]] microorganisms, such as filamentous [[cyanobacteria]], possess the enzyme [[nitrogenase]], responsible for conversion of atmospheric N<sub>2</sub> into [[ammonia]]; molecular hydrogen is a byproduct of this reaction, and is many times not released by the microorganism, but rather taken up by a hydrogen-oxidizing (uptake) hydrogenase. One way of forcing these organisms to produce hydrogen is then to annihilate uptake hydrogenase activity. This has been done on a strain of ''[[Nostoc punctiforme]]'': one of the [[structural gene]]s of the NiFe uptake hydrogenase was inactivated by [[insertional mutagenesis]], and the mutant strain showed hydrogen evolution under illumination.<ref name=Lindberg>{{cite journal\n|last=Lindberg|first=Pia|author2=Sch\u00fbtz, Kathrin|author3= Happe, Thomas|author4= Lindblad, Peter\n|title=A hydrogen-producing, hydrogenase-free mutant strain of ''Nostoc punctiforme'' ATCC 29133\n|journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy|date=November\u2013December 2002|volume=27|issue=11\u201312|pages=1291\u20131296\n|doi=10.1016/S0360-3199(02)00121-0\n}}</ref>\n\nMany of these photoautotrophs also have bidirectional hydrogenases, which can produce hydrogen under certain conditions.

The term artificial photosynthesis is commonly used to refer to any scheme for capturing and storing the energy from sunlight in the chemical bonds of a fuel (a [[solar fuel]]). [[Photocatalytic water splitting]] converts water into [[hydrogen]] and oxygen and is a major research topic of artificial photosynthesis. [[Photochemical carbon dioxide reduction|Light-driven carbon dioxide reduction]] is another process studied that replicates natural [[carbon fixation]].\n\nResearch of this topic includes the design and assembly of devices for the direct production of solar fuels, [[photoelectrochemistry]] and its application in fuel cells, and the engineering of [[enzyme]]s and [[photoautotrophic]] [[microorganism]]s for microbial [[biofuel]] and [[biohydrogen]] production from sunlight.\n\n== Overview ==\nThe photosynthetic reaction can be divided into two [[half-reaction]]s of [[redox|oxidation and reduction]], both of which are essential to producing [[fuel]]. In plant photosynthesis, water molecules are photo-oxidized to release oxygen and protons. The second phase of plant photosynthesis (also known as the [[Calvin-Benson cycle]]) is a [[light-independent reaction]] that converts carbon dioxide into [[glucose]] (fuel). Researchers of artificial photosynthesis are developing [[photocatalyst]]s that are able to perform both of these reactions. Furthermore, the protons resulting from water splitting can be used for hydrogen production. These [[catalyst]]s must be able to react quickly and absorb a large percentage of the incident solar [[photons]].<ref name=Yarris>{{cite web|last=Yarris|first=Lynn |title=Turning Sunlight into Liquid Fuels: Berkeley Lab Researchers Create a Nano-sized Photocatalyst for Artificial Photosynthesis |url=http://newscenter.lbl.gov/press-releases/2009/03/10/turning-sunlight-into-liquid-fuels-berkeley-lab-researchers-create-a-nano-sized-photocatalyst-for-artificial-photosynthesis/|work= Berkeley Lab News Center|publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|accessdate=16 January 2012|date=2009-03-10}}</ref>\n[[File:\u041f\u0440\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438 \u0432\u0435\u0448\u0442\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u0444\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0437\u0430.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|left|Natural (left) versus artificial photosynthesis (right)]]\nWhereas [[photovoltaics]] can provide energy directly from sunlight, the inefficiency of fuel production from photovoltaic electricity (indirect process) and the fact that sunshine is not constant throughout the day sets a limit to its use.<ref name=Styring>{{cite journal|last=Styring|first=Stenbj\u00f6rn|title=Artificial photosynthesis for solar fuels|journal=Faraday Discussions|volume=155|date=21 December 2011|issue=Advance Article|pages=357\u2013376\n|doi=10.1039/C1FD00113B|pmid=22470985|bibcode = 2012FaDi..155..357S|url=https://zenodo.org/record/3426629}}</ref><ref name=\"economist1\">{{cite news| url= https://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2011/02/artificial_photosynthesis| title=The Difference Engine: The sunbeam solution| work=[[The Economist]] | date=11 February 2011}}</ref> \nOne way of using natural photosynthesis is for the production of a [[biofuel]], which is an indirect process that suffers from low energy conversion efficiency (due to photosynthesis' own low efficiency in converting sunlight to biomass), the cost of harvesting and transporting the fuel, and conflicts due to the increasing need of [[land mass]] for food production.<ref name=Listorti>{{cite journal|last=Listorti|first=Andrea|author2=Durrant, James|author3= Barber, Jim|title=Solar to Fuel|journal=Nature Materials|date=December 2009|volume=8|issue=12|pages=929\u2013930|doi=10.1038/nmat2578|pmid=19935695|bibcode = 2009NatMa...8..929L}}</ref> \nThe purpose of artificial photosynthesis is to produce a fuel from sunlight that can be stored conveniently and used when sunlight is not available, by using direct processes, that is, to produce a [[solar fuel]].

Electrons flow from D to A when catalysis occurs.]]\n\nUsing [[biomimetic]] approaches, artificial photosynthesis tries to construct systems doing the same type of processes. Ideally, a [[Catalytic triad|triad]] assembly could oxidize water with one catalyst, reduce protons with another and have a [[photosensitizer]] molecule to power the whole system. One of the simplest designs is where the photosensitizer is linked in tandem between a water oxidation catalyst and a hydrogen evolving catalyst:\n* The photosensitizer transfers electrons to the hydrogen catalyst when hit by light, becoming oxidized in the process.\n* This drives the water splitting catalyst to donate electrons to the photosensitizer. In a triad assembly, such a catalyst is often referred to as a donor. The oxidized donor is able to perform water oxidation.\nThe state of the triad with one catalyst oxidized on one end and the second one reduced on the other end of the triad is referred to as a charge separation, and is a driving force for further electron transfer, and consequently catalysis, to occur. The different components may be assembled in diverse ways, such as [[supramolecular]] complexes, compartmentalized cells, or linearly, [[covalent]]ly linked molecules.<ref name=Andreiadis/>\n\nResearch into finding catalysts that can convert water, carbon dioxide, and sunlight to carbohydrates or hydrogen is a current, active field.

One way of forcing these organisms to produce hydrogen is then to annihilate uptake hydrogenase activity.

In [[photovoltaic]] cells, sunlight is converted into electricity and then converted again into chemical energy for storage, with some necessary loss of energy associated with the second conversion.\n* The byproducts of these reactions are environmentally friendly. Artificially photosynthesized fuel would be a [[carbon-neutral]] source of energy, which could be used for transportation or homes.\n\nDisadvantages include:\n* Materials used for artificial photosynthesis often corrode in water, so they may be less stable than [[photovoltaics]] over long periods of time.

{"title_page": "Multi-sport event", "text_new": "{{Short description|Organized sporting event involving multiple sports}}\n{{Distinguish|Multiple-stage competition{{!}}Multiple-stage competition (disambiguation)}}\n\nA '''multi-sport event''' is an organized [[sport|sporting]] event, often held over multiple days, featuring competition in many different sports among organized teams of athletes from (mostly) [[nation state|nation-states]]. The first major, modern, multi-sport event of international significance was the [[Olympic Games]], first held in modern times in [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896]] in Athens, Greece and inspired by the [[Ancient Olympic Games]], one of a number of such events held in antiquity. Most modern multi-sports events have the same basic structure. Games are held over the \ncourse of several days in and around a \"host city\", which changes for each competition. Countries send national teams to each competition, consisting of individual athletes and teams that compete in a wide variety of sports.  Athletes or teams are awarded [[gold medal|gold]], [[silver medal|silver]] or [[bronze medal]]s for first, second and third place respectively. Each games are generally held every four years, though some are annual competitions.\n\n== History ==\nThe [[Ancient Olympic Games]], first held in 776 BC, was the precursor to the [[Olympic Games|Modern Olympic Games]], although its first edition only featured a footrace and the number of sporting competitions expanded at later editions.\n\nThere were several other \"games\" held in Europe in the [[classical antiquity|classical era]]:\n\n* [[Panhellenic Games]]:\n** ''The [[Pythian Games]]'' (founded 527 BC) held in [[Delphi]] every four years\n** ''The [[Nemean Games]]'' (founded 516 BC) held in [[Argolid]] every two years\n** ''The [[Isthmian Games]]'' (founded 523 BC) held on the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] every two years\n* The [[Roman Games]]&nbsp;\u2013 Arising from Etruscan rather than purely Greek roots, the Roman Games deemphasized footraces and throwing. Instead, the Greek sports of chariot racing and [[wrestling]], as well as the Etruscan sport of gladiatorial combat, took center stage.\n\nOther multi-sport festivals emerged in the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe, including the [[Cotswold Olimpick Games]] in [[England]] in the 1600s, the [[Highland Games]] in [[Scotland]], and the Olympiade de la R\u00e9publique in [[France]] in the 1800s.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, athletes at multi-sport events were almost exclusively male. As international [[women's sport]] began to develop, events such as the [[Women's World Games]] and [[Olympics of Grace]] were held to allow women to engage in sport on the international stage. Though short-lived, events such as these led to greater inclusion of women at multi-sport events over the course of the 20th century.<ref name=\"LeighBonin\">{{Cite journal | last = Leigh | first = Mary H. |author2=Bonin, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se M. | title = The Pioneering Role Of Madame Alice Milliat and the FSFI in Establishing International Trade and Field Competition for Women  | journal = Journal of Sport History | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 72\u201383 | publisher = North American Society for Sport History | year = 1977 | url = http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH1977/JSH0401/jsh0401f.pdf | accessdate = 3 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Audience ==\nSince the establishment of the Olympics, most serial multi-sport events have been organized for specific audiences and participating countries or communities. These affiliations include:\n\n* Regional, such as the [[Asian Games]] and the [[Pan-American Games]]\n* Sub-Regional, such as the [[South Asian Games]], [[Southeast Asian Games]] and the [[South American Games]]\n* Political, such as the [[Spartakiad]] and the [[Games of the New Emerging Forces]] (GANEFO)\n* Historic or historicultural roots, such as the [[Commonwealth Games]] (for members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]) and the [[Jeux de la Francophonie]] (for members of [[La Francophonie]])\n* Ethnocultural or ethnoreligious, such as the [[Pan-Armenian Games]] (for ethnic communities of Armenians both in Armenia and in other countries) and the [[Maccabiah Games]] (for communities of Jews of both ethnic and religious origins)\n* Religious, such as the [[Islamic Solidarity Games]] and the previously mentioned Maccabiah Games\n* Occupational, such as the [[Military World Games]], the [[World Police and Fire Games]], and the [[Universiade]]\n* Physical disabilities, such as the [[Paralympics]] and the [[Deaflympics]]\n* Intellectual disabilities, such as the [[Special Olympics World Games]]\n* Age, such as the [[World Masters Games]], [[Commonwealth Youth Games]], and the [[Senior Olympics]]\n* Gender and sexual orientation, such as the [[Women's Islamic Games]] and the [[Gay Games]]\n\n==Historic events==\n===Olympic Games===\n{{Main|Olympic Games}}\n\nThe first modern multi-sport [[Sports competition|event]] organised were the Olympic Games, organised by the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) (est. 1894) for the first time in 1896 in [[Athens]], [[Greece]]. After some celebrations (1900, 1904), the Olympics became very popular nowadays. The number of sports, initially only a few, is still growing.\n\n===Paralympic Games===\n{{Main|Paralympic Games}}\n\nThe Paralympic Games is the largest multi-sport event involving athletes with physical disabilities and is organized by the [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC). Arranged for the first time in 1960 in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]. The number of sports, initially only a few, is still growing.\n\n===Special Olympics===\n{{Main|Special Olympics World Games}}\n\nThe first Special Olympics International Summer Games were held in [[Chicago]], Illinois, in 1968. The most recent Special Olympics World Winter Games in Schladming, Austria involved 25 sports and approximately 2,277 athletes from 133 countries.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Special_Olympics_World_Winter_Games |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2019-01-31</ref>\n===Others===\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, another multi-sport event, the [[Nordic Games]] were first held. These Games were held in [[Scandinavia]], and the sports conducted were winter sports such as [[cross-country skiing]] and [[speed skating]]. The Nordic Games were last held in 1926, after which the 1924 Winter Sports Week in [[Chamonix]] was declared the first [[Olympic Winter Games]].\nIn the 1920s, all kinds of other multi-sport events were set up. These were usually directed for a selected group of athletes, rather than everybody, which was basically the case with the Olympic Games.

The first major, modern, multi-sport event of international significance was the [[Olympic Games]], first held in modern times in [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896]] in Athens, Greece and inspired by the [[Ancient Olympic Games]], one of a number of such events held in antiquity. Most modern multi-sports events have the same basic structure. Games are held over the \ncourse of several days in and around a \"host city\", which changes for each competition. Countries send national teams to each competition, consisting of individual athletes and teams that compete in a wide variety of sports.  Athletes or teams are awarded [[gold medal|gold]], [[silver medal|silver]] or [[bronze medal]]s for first, second and third place respectively. Each games are generally held every four years, though some are annual competitions.\n\n== History ==\nThe [[Ancient Olympic Games]], first held in 776 BC, was the precursor to the [[Olympic Games|Modern Olympic Games]], although its first edition only featured a footrace and the number of sporting competitions expanded at later editions.\n\nThere were several other \"games\" held in Europe in the [[classical antiquity|classical era]]:\n\n* [[Panhellenic Games]]:\n** ''The [[Pythian Games]]'' (founded 527 BC) held in [[Delphi]] every four years\n** ''The [[Nemean Games]]'' (founded 516 BC) held in [[Argolid]] every two years\n** ''The [[Isthmian Games]]'' (founded 523 BC) held on the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] every two years\n* The [[Roman Games]]&nbsp;\u2013 Arising from Etruscan rather than purely Greek roots, the Roman Games deemphasized footraces and throwing. Instead, the Greek sports of chariot racing and [[wrestling]], as well as the Etruscan sport of gladiatorial combat, took center stage.\n\nOther multi-sport festivals emerged in the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe, including the [[Cotswold Olimpick Games]] in [[England]] in the 1600s, the [[Highland Games]] in [[Scotland]], and the Olympiade de la R\u00e9publique in [[France]] in the 1800s.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, athletes at multi-sport events were almost exclusively male. As international [[women's sport]] began to develop, events such as the [[Women's World Games]] and [[Olympics of Grace]] were held to allow women to engage in sport on the international stage. Though short-lived, events such as these led to greater inclusion of women at multi-sport events over the course of the 20th century.<ref name=\"LeighBonin\">{{Cite journal | last = Leigh | first = Mary H. |author2=Bonin, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se M. | title = The Pioneering Role Of Madame Alice Milliat and the FSFI in Establishing International Trade and Field Competition for Women  | journal = Journal of Sport History | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 72\u201383 | publisher = North American Society for Sport History | year = 1977 | url = http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH1977/JSH0401/jsh0401f.pdf | accessdate = 3 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Audience ==\nSince the establishment of the Olympics, most serial multi-sport events have been organized for specific audiences and participating countries or communities.

After some celebrations (1900, 1904), the Olympics became very popular nowadays. The number of sports, initially only a few, is still growing.\n\n===Paralympic Games===\n{{Main|Paralympic Games}}\n\nThe Paralympic Games is the largest multi-sport event involving athletes with physical disabilities and is organized by the [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC).

These Games were held in [[Scandinavia]], and the sports conducted were winter sports such as [[cross-country skiing]] and [[speed skating]]. The Nordic Games were last held in 1926, after which the 1924 Winter Sports Week in [[Chamonix]] was declared the first [[Olympic Winter Games]].\nIn the 1920s, all kinds of other multi-sport events were set up. These were usually directed for a selected group of athletes, rather than everybody, which was basically the case with the Olympic Games. The Soviets organized the first [[Spartakiad]] in 1920, a communist alternative to the 'bourgeois' Olympic Games, and in 1922 the University Olympia was organizedor in [[Italy]], the forerunner of the [[World University Games]], meant for students only.\nRegional games were another kind of multi-sport event that was established, such as the [[Far Eastern Championship Games]] (1913), the [[Central American and Caribbean Games]] (1926) or the [[Pan American Games]] (1951).\n==List of international multi-sport competitions==\n{{Main|List of multi-sport events}}\nThe Olympic Games are still the largest multi-sport event in the world in terms of worldwide interest and importance (though no longer in participation), but several others also have significance.\n=== Worldwide events ===\n; Multi-sport events for non-Olympic sports\n*[[World Games]], held first in 1981, stage many sports (though not all) that are not Olympic sports.

Andy Burnham]</ref> One ancient name for Montrose was Celurca.<ref>Mitchell (1866), p1</ref> Early place names appear to show the presence of a [[Norsemen|Norse]] settlement in the area of the present harbour. The Norse settlement was named Stroma which translates as 'Tide race river', referring to the speed of the tidal emptying and filling of the aforementioned basin, (est 9 knots). It is claimed that the name Montrose stems from 'Mouth Hrossay' due to the location at the outlets of the [[River North Esk|River Esk]] near Rossie Island (Norse: horse island). The etymology is alternatively attributed to the [[G\u00e0idhlig|gaelic]] words ''Monadh'' (meaning moor) and Rois or Ros (meaning peninsula or promontory). The first documentary evidence of the existence of Montrose is the burgh charter issued by [[David I of Scotland|David I]] who founded the town around 1140 as ''Sallorch'' or ''Sallork''.<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\">[http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm \"The Royal Burgh of Montrose\", Angus Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623025501/http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm |date=23 June 2006 }}</ref> By 1178 the name had taken the form ''Munross'' before becoming ''Montrose''.<ref>A.D Mills, ''A Dictionary of British Place-Names''.

During the 1140s it was an important trading town. The trading revenues received from Montrose as well as [[Forfar]] and [[Dundee]] were acquired by [[Malcolm IV]] and contributed to [[Restenneth Priory]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> In 1178 [[William the Lion]] built a castle nearby in which he would occasionally reside.

Some accounts state that it was there that he humiliated Scottish King [[John de Balliol]] by publicly stripping him of his royal insignia and status; other accounts claim that this occurred in [[Brechin]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Twelve burgesses of the town swore allegiance to Edward I<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/> to protect themselves and the community of the town.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> The following year the castle, which was manned by an English garrison,  was destroyed by [[William Wallace]] who is said to have slain all soldiers in sight.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/> The site of the castle, known as Castlestead, is at the southern end of the High Street. [[David II of Scotland|David II]] visited it towards the end of his reign in 1371.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> [[Duke of Montrose|The Dukedom of Montrose]] was created in 1488.\n\nDuring the 15th century the inhabitants of the town found themselves increasingly under heel of the Lairds of Dun who ransacked and took possession of property and cattle. The lairds are said to have arrived in the middle of one night on horseback heavily armed. The burghesses of the town immediately sent out an appeal to the Duke of Montrose for protection but the messenger was purportedly murdered before the appeal arrived. It was then that [[James IV of Scotland]] intervened and settled the matter.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/>\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:Montrose and The Steeple - geograph.org.uk - 487549.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Montrose and the steeple]]\nFrom its early inception as a port Montrose had traded in skins, hides and cured salmon but in the 17th century began to export wheat and barley in regular trading transactions with the [[Hanseatic League]]. The town imported flax and timber from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]; salt, fruit and wine from [[France]] and [[Portugal]].<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\"/> The wealth this brought to the town is demonstrated in the surviving houses built by landowning and merchant families as well as local street names of \"America Street\", \"California Street\", \"Baltic Street\" and \"India Street\" evidencing its trading heritage.\n[[File:A Park at Montrose - geograph.org.uk - 1311715.jpg|left|thumb|Park in Montrose]]\nThe site of the castle, now known as Castlestead was the birthplace of the famous [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]]. Graham signed the National Covenant against [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s reorganisation of the Kirk in Scotland, fighting in the ensuing Bishops' Wars, but later switched to the King's side only to be captured and executed in [[Edinburgh]] in the year 1650.\n\nThe final chapter of the ill-fated 1715 Jacobite rebellion was also played out in Montrose. Towards the end of the uprising (which had lasted nearly six months, from September 1715 to February 1716) [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (the Old Pretender; formerly James, Prince of Wales) arrived in Montrose, where he spent his last night in Scotland, on 4 February 1716. He sailed from Montrose to exile in France. The town was held for his son, [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (Bonnie Prince Charlie; the Young Pretender), 30 years later and in February 1746 the largest naval battle of the war was fought in Montrose Harbour.\n\nDuring the 18th century the town was a major [[smuggling]] centre. It profited from the slave trade but only for a brief time. The wealth accrued by trade was substantial. Wealthy merchants in the 18th and 19th centuries dominated the town and built their houses gable to gable. Hence Montrosians have inherited the sobriquet, \"gable-enders\".<ref>Alan Murphy, Scotland, Footprint Travel Guides. 2004, p504</ref> A statistical account taken between 1791 and 1799 estimates the population in the 1750s as 4248; in 1776 as 4465; in 1784 as 4866 and in 1790 as 5194.

The Norse settlement was named Stroma which translates as 'Tide race river', referring to the speed of the tidal emptying and filling of the aforementioned basin, (est 9 knots). It is claimed that the name Montrose stems from 'Mouth Hrossay' due to the location at the outlets of the [[River North Esk|River Esk]] near Rossie Island (Norse: horse island). The etymology is alternatively attributed to the [[G\u00e0idhlig|gaelic]] words ''Monadh'' (meaning moor) and Rois or Ros (meaning peninsula or promontory). The first documentary evidence of the existence of Montrose is the burgh charter issued by [[David I of Scotland|David I]] who founded the town around 1140 as ''Sallorch'' or ''Sallork''.<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\">[http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm \"The Royal Burgh of Montrose\", Angus Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623025501/http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm |date=23 June 2006 }}</ref> By 1178 the name had taken the form ''Munross'' before becoming ''Montrose''.<ref>A.D Mills, ''A Dictionary of British Place-Names''.

During the 1140s it was an important trading town. The trading revenues received from Montrose as well as [[Forfar]] and [[Dundee]] were acquired by [[Malcolm IV]] and contributed to [[Restenneth Priory]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> In 1178 [[William the Lion]] built a castle nearby in which he would occasionally reside.

The lairds are said to have arrived in the middle of one night on horseback heavily armed. The burghesses of the town immediately sent out an appeal to the Duke of Montrose for protection but the messenger was purportedly murdered before the appeal arrived.

The town imported flax and timber from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]; salt, fruit and wine from [[France]] and [[Portugal]].<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\"/> The wealth this brought to the town is demonstrated in the surviving houses built by landowning and merchant families as well as local street names of \"America Street\", \"California Street\", \"Baltic Street\" and \"India Street\" evidencing its trading heritage.\n[[File:A Park at Montrose - geograph.org.uk - 1311715.jpg|left|thumb|Park in Montrose]]\nThe site of the castle, now known as Castlestead was the birthplace of the famous [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]]. Graham signed the National Covenant against [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s reorganisation of the Kirk in Scotland, fighting in the ensuing Bishops' Wars, but later switched to the King's side only to be captured and executed in [[Edinburgh]] in the year 1650.\n\nThe final chapter of the ill-fated 1715 Jacobite rebellion was also played out in Montrose. Towards the end of the uprising (which had lasted nearly six months, from September 1715 to February 1716) [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (the Old Pretender; formerly James, Prince of Wales) arrived in Montrose, where he spent his last night in Scotland, on 4 February 1716. He sailed from Montrose to exile in France. The town was held for his son, [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (Bonnie Prince Charlie; the Young Pretender), 30 years later and in February 1746 the largest naval battle of the war was fought in Montrose Harbour.\n\nDuring the 18th century the town was a major [[smuggling]] centre. It profited from the slave trade but only for a brief time. The wealth accrued by trade was substantial. Wealthy merchants in the 18th and 19th centuries dominated the town and built their houses gable to gable. Hence Montrosians have inherited the sobriquet, \"gable-enders\".<ref>Alan Murphy, Scotland, Footprint Travel Guides. 2004, p504</ref> A statistical account taken between 1791 and 1799 estimates the population in the 1750s as 4248; in 1776 as 4465; in 1784 as 4866 and in 1790 as 5194.

Its facilities were expanded several in the next few decades and it underwent various changes in name, finally becoming Sunnyside Royal Hospital in 1962.

As well as a training base Montrose was also an operational airfield for [[Hawker Hurricane]] and [[Supermarine Spitfire]] squadrons, which flew sorties over [[Norway]] and were a part of the air defences for [[Edinburgh]]. Of course, this also made the town a target for German aircraft and it was bombed on more than one occasion.

There were many different electrical telegraph systems invented, but the ones that became widespread fit into two broad categories.  The first category consists of [[needle telegraph]]s in which a needle pointer is made to move electromagnetically with a pulse of [[electric current]] from a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] or [[dynamo]] down the telegraph line.  Early systems used multiple needles requiring multiple wires.  The first commercial system, and the most widely used needle telegraph, was the [[Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph]], invented in 1837.  Early equipment sets used five needles to point to the letter being transmitted, but the cost of installing wires was more economically significant than the cost of training operators so a single-needle system with a code that had to be learned became the norm.\n\nThe second category consists of armature systems in which the pulse activates a [[telegraph sounder]] which makes a click.  The archetype of this category was the Morse system, invented by [[Samuel Morse]] in 1838, using a single wire.  At the sending station, an operator would tap on a switch called a [[telegraph key]], spelling out text messages in [[Morse code]].  Originally, the armature was intended to make marks on paper tape, but operators learned to interpret the clicks and it was more efficient to write down the message directly.  In 1865, the Morse system became the standard for international communication with a modified code developed for German railways.  However, some countries continued to use established national systems internally for some time afterwards.\n\nIn the 1840s the electrical telegraph superseded [[optical telegraph]] systems (except in France), becoming the standard way to send urgent messages.  By the latter half of the century, most developed nations had created commercial telegraph networks with local [[telegraph office]]s in most cities and towns, allowing the public to send messages called [[telegram]]s addressed to any person in the country, for a fee.  Beginning in 1854 [[submarine telegraph cable]]s allowed for the first rapid communication between continents. Electrical telegraph networks permitted people and commerce to transmit messages across both continents and oceans almost instantly, with widespread social and economic impacts.<ref>{{Citation|last= Tancia |title= A History of Telegraphy |year= 2014 |url= https://www.pens.co.uk/pen2paper/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/A-History-of-Telegraphy.pdf }}</ref>  In the early 20th century the telegraph was slowly replaced by [[Teleprinter|teletype]] networks.\n\n== History ==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[List of basic communication topics]] -->\n\n===Early work===\n[[File:Soemmerring 1810 telegraph overview.jpg|thumb|S\u00f6mmering's electric telegraph in 1809]]\nFrom early studies of electricity, electrical phenomena were known to travel with great speed, and many experimenters worked on the application of electricity to [[communication]]s at a distance. All the known effects of electricity\u2014such as [[electric spark|sparks]], [[electrostatic attraction]], [[chemical change]]s, [[electric shock]]s, and later [[electromagnetism]]\u2014were applied to the problems of detecting controlled transmissions of electricity at various distances.<ref>Fahie, p.?</ref>\n\t\nIn 1753, an anonymous writer in the ''[[Scots Magazine]]'' suggested an electrostatic telegraph. Using one wire for each letter of the alphabet, a message could be transmitted by connecting the wire terminals in turn to an electrostatic machine, and observing the deflection of [[pith]] balls at the far end.<ref>E. A. Marland, ''Early Electrical Communication'', Abelard-Schuman Ltd, London 1964, no ISBN, Library of Congress 64-20875, pages 17-19;</ref> The writer has never been positively identified, but the letter was signed C.M. and posted from [[Renfrew]] leading to a Charles Marshall of Renfrew being suggested.<ref>Holzmann & Pehrson, p. 203</ref> Telegraphs employing electrostatic attraction were the basis of early experiments in electrical telegraphy in Europe, but were abandoned as being impractical and were never developed into a useful communication system. Also STAN BTS AND TWICE YOU FOOLS <ref>{{Citation | title = Electromagnetic Telegraph - Invented by Baron Pavel Schilling | url = http://www.edubilla.com/invention/electrical-telegraph/ }}</ref>\n\nIn 1774, [[Georges-Louis Le Sage]] realised an early electric telegraph. The telegraph had a separate wire for each of the 26 letters of the [[alphabet]] and its range was only between two rooms of his home.<ref>Prevost, 1805, pp. 176-178</ref>\n\nIn 1800, [[Alessandro Volta]] invented the [[voltaic pile]], allowing for a [[continuous current]] of [[electricity]] for experimentation. This became a source of a low-voltage current that could be used to produce more distinct effects, and which was far less limited than the momentary discharge of an [[electrostatic generator|electrostatic machine]], which with [[Leyden jar]]s were the only previously known man-made sources of electricity.\n\t \t\nAnother very early experiment in electrical telegraphy was an 'electrochemical telegraph' created by the [[Germans|German]] physician, anatomist and inventor [[Samuel Thomas von S\u00f6mmering]] in 1809, based on an earlier, less robust design of 1804 by Spanish [[polymath]] and scientist [[Francisco Salva Campillo]].{{sfn|Jones|1999}} Both their designs employed multiple wires (up to 35) to represent almost all Latin letters and numerals. Thus, messages could be conveyed electrically up to a few kilometers (in von S\u00f6mmering's design), with each of the telegraph receiver's wires immersed in a separate glass tube of acid. An electric current was sequentially applied by the sender through the various wires representing each letter of a message; at the recipient's end the currents electrolysed the acid in the tubes in sequence, releasing streams of hydrogen bubbles next to each associated letter or numeral. The telegraph receiver's operator would watch the bubbles and could then record the transmitted message.{{sfn|Jones|1999}} This is in contrast to later telegraphs that used a single wire (with ground return).\n\t \t\n[[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]] discovered in 1820 that an electric current produces a magnetic field that will deflect a compass needle. In the same year [[Johann Schweigger]] invented the [[galvanometer]], with a coil of wire around a compass, which could be used as a sensitive indicator for an electric current.<ref>M. (10 December 2014). Schweigger Multiplier \u2013 1820. Retrieved 7 February 2018, from https://nationalmaglab.org/education/magnet-academy/history-of-electricity-magnetism/museum/schweigger-multiplier</ref> Also that year, [[Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re]] suggested that telegraphy could be achieved by placing small magnets under the ends of a set of wires, one pair of wires for each letter of the alphabet. He was apparently unaware of Schweigger's invention at the time, which would have made his system much more sensitive. In 1825, [[Peter Barlow (mathematician)|Peter Barlow]] tried Amp\u00e8re's idea but only got it to work over {{convert|200|ft|m}} and declared it impractical. In 1830 [[William Ritchie (physicist)|William Ritchie]] improved on Amp\u00e8re's design by placing the magnetic needles inside a coil of wire connected to each pair of conductors. He successfully demonstrated it, showing the feasibility of the electromagnetic telegraph, but only within a lecture hall.<ref>Fahie, pp. 302\u2013306</ref>\n\t \t\nIn 1825, [[William Sturgeon]] invented the [[electromagnet]], with a single winding of uninsulated wire on a piece of varnished [[iron]], which increased the magnetic force produced by electric current. [[Joseph Henry]] improved it in 1828 by placing several windings of insulated wire around the bar, creating a much more powerful electromagnet which could operate a telegraph through the high resistance of long telegraph wires.<ref>{{cite book|title= Technology and Society| author=R.

Pavel Schilling subsequently improved its apparatus by reducing the number of connecting wires from eight to two.\n\t \t\nOn 21 October 1832, Schilling managed a short-distance transmission of signals between two telegraphs in different rooms of his apartment. In 1836, the British government attempted to buy the design but Schilling instead accepted overtures from [[Nicholas&nbsp;I of Russia]]. Schilling's telegraph was tested on a {{convert|5|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} experimental underground and underwater cable, laid around the building of the main Admiralty in Saint Petersburg and was approved for a telegraph between the imperial palace at [[Peterhof Palace|Peterhof]] and the naval base at [[Kronstadt]]. However, the project was cancelled following Schilling's death in 1837.{{sfn|Huurdeman|2003|p=54}} Schilling was also one of the first to put into practice the idea of the [[binary coding|binary]] system of signal transmission.\n\t\nIn 1833, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], together with the physics professor [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Wilhelm Weber]] in [[G\u00f6ttingen]] installed a {{convert|1200|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} wire above the town's roofs. Gauss combined the [[Schweigger multiplier|Poggendorff-Schweigger multiplicator]] with his magnetometer to build a more sensitive device, the [[galvanometer]]. To change the direction of the electric current, he constructed a [[commutator (electric)|commutator]] of his own. As a result, he was able to make the distant needle move in the direction set by the commutator on the other end of the line.\n\n[[File:Diagram of alphabet used in a 5 needle Cooke and Wheatstone Telegraph, indicating the letter G.png|thumb|left|Diagram of alphabet used in a 5 needle Cooke and Wheatstone Telegraph, indicating the letter G]]At first, Gauss and Weber used the telegraph to coordinate time, but soon they developed other signals and finally, their own alphabet. The alphabet was encoded in a binary code which was transmitted by positive or negative voltage pulses which were generated by means of moving an induction coil up and down over a permanent magnet and connecting the coil with the transmission wires by means of the commutator. The page of Gauss' laboratory notebook containing both his code and the first message transmitted, as well as a replica of the telegraph made in the 1850s under the instructions of Weber are kept in the faculty of physics at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]], in Germany.\n\nGauss was convinced that this communication would be a help to his kingdom's towns. Later in the same year, instead of a [[Voltaic pile]], Gauss used an [[Electromagnetic induction|induction]] pulse, enabling him to transmit seven letters a minute instead of two. The inventors and university did not have the funds to develop the telegraph on their own, but they received funding from [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. [[Carl August Steinheil]] in [[Munich]] was able to build a telegraph network within the city in 1835\u20131836. He installed a telegraph line along the first German railroad in 1835.  Steinheil built a telegraph along the [[Nuremberg - F\u00fcrth railway line]] in 1838, the first [[earth-return telegraph]] put into service.\n\nBy 1837, [[William Fothergill Cooke]] and [[Charles Wheatstone]] had co-developed a [[Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph|telegraph system]] which used a number of needles on a board that could be moved to point to letters of the alphabet. Any number of needles could be used, depending on the number of characters it was required to code. In May 1837 they patented their system. The patent recommended five needles, which coded twenty of the alphabet's 26 letters.\n\n[[File:Wallace Study-Telegraph.jpg|thumb|Morse key and sounder]]\n[[Samuel Morse]] independently developed and patented a recording electric telegraph in 1837. Morse's assistant [[Alfred Vail]] developed an instrument that was called the register for recording the received messages. It embossed dots and dashes on a moving paper tape by a stylus which was operated by an electromagnet.{{sfn|Calvert|2008}} Morse and Vail developed the [[Morse code]] signalling [[alphabet]].

System, used mostly on private wires. This consisted of a \"communicator\" at the sending end and an \"indicator\" at the receiving end. The communicator consisted of a circular dial with a pointer and the 26 letters of the alphabet (and four punctuation marks) around its circumference. Against each letter was a key that could be pressed. A transmission would begin with the pointers on the dials at both ends set to the start position. The transmitting operator would then press down the key corresponding to the letter to be transmitted. In the base of the communicator was a [[magneto]] actuated by a handle on the front. This would be turned to apply an alternating voltage to the line. Each half cycle of the current would move the pointers at both ends on by one position. When the pointer reached the position of the depressed key, it would stop and the magneto would be disconnected from the line. The communicator's pointer was geared to the magneto mechanism. The indicator's pointer was moved by a polarised electromagnet whose [[Armature (electrical)|armature]] was coupled to it through an [[escapement]]. Thus the alternating line voltage moved the indicator's pointer on to the position of the depressed key on the communicator. Pressing another key would then release the pointer and the previous key, and re-connect the magneto to the line. These machines were very robust and simple to operate, and they stayed in use in Britain until well into the 20th century.<ref>{{Citation |last= Freebody |first= J.

With different codes, additional operators were required to translate and retransmit the message.

The US, however, continued to use [[American Morse code]] internally for some time, hence international messages required retransmission in both directions.<ref>Andrew L.

They had an extensive [[optical telegraph]] system built during the [[Napoleonic era]].  There was also serious concern that an electrical telegraph could be quickly put out of action by enemy saboteurs, something that was much more difficult to do with optical telegraphs which had no exposed hardware between stations.  The [[Foy-Breguet telegraph]] was eventually adopted.  This was a two-needle system using two signal wires, but displayed in a uniquely different way to other needle telegraphs.  The needles made symbols similar to the Chappe optical system symbols, making it more familiar to the telegraph operators.  The optical system was decommissioned starting in 1846, but not completed until 1855.  In that year the Foy-Breguet system was replaced with the Morse system.<ref>Holzmann & Pehrson, pp. 93\u201394</ref>\n\n===Expansion===\nAs well as the rapid expansion of the use of the telegraphs along the railways, they soon spread into the field of mass communication with the instruments being installed in [[post office]]s.

Proce Wellcome V0025510.jpg|thumb|left|Wheatstone automated telegraph network equipment]]\nA continuing goal in telegraphy was to reduce the cost per message by reducing hand-work, or increasing the sending rate.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} There were many experiments with moving pointers, and various electrical encodings. However, most systems were too complicated and unreliable. A successful expedient to reduce the cost per message was the development of [[telegraphese]].\n\nThe first system that didn't require skilled technicians to operate, was Charles Wheatstone's ABC system in 1840 where the letters of the alphabet were arranged around a clock-face, and the signal caused a needle to indicate the letter. This early system required the receiver to be present in real time to record the message and it reached speeds of up to 15 words a minute.\n\nIn 1846, [[Alexander Bain (inventor)|Alexander Bain]] patented a chemical telegraph in Edinburgh. The signal current moved an iron pen across a moving paper tape soaked in a mixture of ammonium nitrate and potassium ferrocyanide, decomposing the chemical and producing readable blue marks in Morse code. The speed of the printing telegraph was 16 and a half words per minute, but messages still required translation into English by live copyists. Chemical telegraphy came to an end in the US in 1851, when the Morse group defeated the Bain patent in the US District Court.<ref>Oslin, George P. The Story of Telecommunications, Mercer University Press, 1992. 69.</ref>\n\nFor a brief period, starting with the New York\u2013Boston line in 1848, some telegraph networks began to employ sound operators, who were trained to understand Morse code aurally. Gradually, the use of sound operators eliminated the need for telegraph receivers to include register and tape. Instead, the receiving instrument was developed into a \"sounder\", an electromagnet that was energized by a current and attracted a small iron lever. When the sounding key was opened or closed, the sounder lever struck an anvil. The Morse operator distinguished a dot and a dash by the short or long interval between the two clicks. The message was then written out in long-hand.<ref>Oslin, George P. The Story of Telecommunications. Mercer University Press, 1992. 67</ref>\n\n[[Royal Earl House]] developed and patented a letter-printing telegraph system in 1846 which employed an alphabetic keyboard for the transmitter and automatically printed the letters on paper at the receiver,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.gatunka.com/2014/04/14/letter-printing-telegraph-us-patent-4464/|title=Royal Earl House Printing-Telegraph Patent #4464, 1846|accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref> and followed this up with a steam-powered version in 1852.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.gatunka.com/2014/04/15/steam-powered-letter-printing-telegraph-us-patent-9505/|title=Royal Earl House Steam-Powered Printing-Telegraph Patent #9505, 1852|accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref> Advocates of printing telegraphy said it would eliminate Morse operators' errors.

The Story of Telecommunications, 1992. 71</ref>\n\n[[File:Clavier Baudot.jpg|thumb|200px|upright=1.5|A Baudot keyboard, 1884]]\n[[David Edward Hughes]] invented the printing telegraph in 1855; it used a keyboard of 26 keys for the alphabet and a spinning type wheel that determined the letter being transmitted by the length of time that had elapsed since the previous transmission. The system allowed for automatic recording on the receiving end. The system was very stable and accurate and became accepted around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/hughes.html|title=David Edward Hughes|accessdate=2010-09-29|date=14 April 2007|publisher=Clarkson University|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422072443/http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/hughes.html|archivedate=2008-04-22}}</ref>\n\nThe next improvement was the [[Baudot code]] of 1874. French engineer [[\u00c9mile Baudot]] patented a printing telegraph in which the signals were translated automatically into typographic characters. Each character was assigned a five-bit code, mechanically interpreted from the state of five on/off switches. Operators had to maintain a steady rhythm, and the usual speed of operation was 30 words per minute.{{sfn|Beauchamp|2001|pp=394\u2013395}}\n\nBy this point reception had been automated, but the speed and accuracy of the transmission was still limited to the skill of the human operator. The first practical automated system was patented by Charles Wheatstone, the original inventor of the telegraph. The message (in [[Morse code]]) was typed onto a piece of perforated tape using a keyboard-like device called the 'Stick Punch'. The transmitter automatically ran the tape through and transmitted the message at the then exceptionally high speed of 70 words per minute.\n\n====Teleprinters====\n{{main|Teleprinter|Telex}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2020}}\n[[File:Phelps' Electro-motor Printing Telegraph.jpg|left|thumb|Phelps' Electro-motor Printing Telegraph from circa 1880, the last and most advanced telegraphy mechanism designed by [[George May Phelps]]]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2008-0516-500, Fernschreibmaschine mit Telefonanschluss.jpg|thumb|right|A Creed Model 7 teleprinter in 1930]]\n[[File:Teletype-IMG 7289.jpg|right|thumb|220px|[[Teletype Model 33]] ASR (Automatic Send and Receive)]]\nAn early successful [[teleprinter]] was invented by [[Frederick G. Creed]]. In [[Glasgow]] he created his first keyboard perforator, which used compressed air to punch the holes. He also created a reperforator (receiving perforator) and a printer. The reperforator punched incoming Morse signals on to paper tape and the printer decoded this tape to produce alphanumeric characters on plain paper. This was the origin of the Creed High Speed Automatic Printing System, which could run at an unprecedented 200 words per minute. His system was adopted by the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' for daily transmission of the newspaper contents.\n\nWith the invention of the [[teletypewriter]], telegraphic encoding became fully automated. Early teletypewriters used the ITA-1 [[Baudot code]], a five-bit code. This yielded only thirty-two codes, so it was over-defined into two \"shifts\", \"letters\" and \"figures\". An explicit, unshared shift code prefaced each set of letters and figures. In 1901, Baudot's code was modified by [[Donald Murray (inventor)|Donald Murray]].\n\nIn the 1930s teleprinters were produced by [[Teletype Corporation|Teletype]] in the US, [[Creed & Company|Creed]] in Britain and [[Siemens]] in Germany.\n\nBy 1935, message routing was the last great barrier to full automation. Large telegraphy providers began to develop systems that used [[telephone exchange|telephone-like rotary dialling]] to connect teletypewriters. These resulting system was called \"Telex\" (TELegraph EXchange). Telex machines first performed rotary-telephone-style [[pulse dialling]] for [[circuit switching]], and then sent data by [[ITA2]]. This \"type A\" Telex routing functionally automated message routing.\n\nThe first wide-coverage Telex network was implemented in Germany during the 1930s{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} as a network used to communicate within the government.\n\nAt the rate of 45.45 (\u00b10.5%) [[baud]] \u2014 considered speedy at the time \u2014 up to 25 telex channels could share a single long-distance telephone channel by using ''[[voice frequency telegraphy]] [[frequency-division multiplexing|multiplexing]]'', making telex the least expensive method of reliable long-distance communication.\n\nAutomatic teleprinter exchange service was introduced into Canada by [[CPR Telegraphs]] and [[CN Telegraph]] in July 1957 and in 1958, [[Western Union]] started to build a Telex network in the United States.<ref>Phillip R. Easterlin, \"Telex in New York\", Western Union Technical Review, April 1959: 45</ref>\n\n====The harmonic telegraph====\n{{main|Invention of the telephone}}\n{{see also|Acoustic telegraphy}}\nThe most expensive aspect of a telegraph system was the installation \u2013 the laying of the wire, which was often very long. The costs would be better covered by finding a way to send more than one message at a time through the single wire, thus increasing revenue per wire. Early devices included the [[duplex (telegraph)|duplex]] and the [[Quadruplex telegraph|quadruplex]] which allowed, respectively, one or two telegraph transmissions in each direction.  However, an even greater number of channels was desired on the busiest lines.  In the latter half of the 1800s, several inventors worked towards creating a method for doing just that, including [[Charles Bourseul]], [[Thomas Edison]], [[Elisha Gray]], and [[Alexander Graham Bell]].\n\nOne approach was to have resonators of several different frequencies act as carriers of a modulated on-off signal.  This was the harmonic telegraph, a form of [[Multiplexing#Frequency-division multiplexing|frequency-division multiplexing]]. These various frequencies, referred to as harmonics, could then be combined into one complex signal and sent down the single wire. On the receiving end, the frequencies would be separated with a matching set of resonators.\n\nWith a set of frequencies being carried down a single wire, it was realized that the human voice itself could be transmitted electrically through the wire. This effort led to the [[invention of the telephone]]. (While the work toward packing multiple telegraph signals onto one wire led to telephony, later advances would pack multiple voice signals onto one wire by increasing the bandwidth by modulating frequencies much higher than human hearing. Eventually the bandwidth was widened much further by using laser light signals sent through fiber optic cables. Fiber optic transmission can carry 25,000 telephone signals simultaneously down a single fiber.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.explainthatstuff.com/fiberoptics.html |title = How does fiber optics work?}}</ref>)\n\n===Oceanic telegraph cables===\n[[File:1891 Telegraph Lines.jpg|right|thumb|333px|Major telegraph lines in 1891.]]\n{{Main|Transatlantic telegraph cable||Submarine communications cable}}\nSoon after the first successful telegraph systems were operational, the possibility of transmitting messages across the sea by way of [[submarine communications cable]]s was first proposed. One of the primary technical challenges was to sufficiently insulate the submarine cable to prevent the current from leaking out into the water. In 1842, a Scottish surgeon [[William Montgomerie]]<ref name=Haigh26>{{cite book|last=Haigh|first=K R|title=Cable Ships and Submarine Cables|year=1968|publisher=Adlard Coles Ltd|location=London|pages=26\u201327}}</ref> introduced [[gutta-percha]], the adhesive juice of the ''[[Palaquium gutta]]'' tree, to Europe. [[Michael Faraday]] and Wheatstone soon discovered the merits of gutta-percha as an insulator, and in 1845, the latter suggested that it should be employed to cover the wire which was proposed to be laid from [[Dover]] to [[Calais]]. Gutta-percha was used as insulation on a wire laid across the [[Rhine]] between [[Cologne-Deutz|Deutz]] and [[Cologne]].<ref>Bright, Charles (1898).

Secret messages were encoded, so interception alone would not be sufficient for the opposing side to gain an advantage. There were geographical constraints on intercepting the telegraph cables, but once radio was used, interception could be much more widespread.\n\n===Crimean war===\nThe [[Crimean War]] was one of the first conflicts to use [[Telegraphy|telegraphs]] and was one of the first to be documented extensively. In 1854, the government in London created a military Telegraph Detachment for the Army commanded by an officer of the [[Royal Engineers]]. It was to comprise twenty-five men from the Royal Corps of Sappers & Miners trained by the Electric Telegraph Company to construct and work the first field electric telegraph.<ref>{{Citation |last= Roberts |first= Steven |title = Distant Writing A History of Telegraph Companies in Britain between 1838 and 1868: 16.

After the French extended the telegraph to the coast of the Black Sea in late 1854, the news reached [[London]] in two days. When the British laid an underwater cable to the Crimean peninsula in April 1855, news reached London in a few hours. The daily news reports energised public opinion, which brought down the government and led to Lord Palmerston becoming prime minister.{{sfn|Figes|2010|pp=304\u201311}}\n\n===American Civil War===\nDuring the [[American Civil War]] the telegraph proved its value as a tactical, operational, and strategic communication medium and an important contributor to Union victory.<ref>{{Citation |last= Hochfelder |first= David |title= Essential Civil WAR Curriculum: The Telegraph |publisher= Virginia Center for Civil War Studies at Virginia Tech |year= 2019 |url= https://www.essentialcivilwarcurriculum.com/the-telegraph.html }}</ref> By contrast the Confederacy failed to make effective use of the South's much smaller telegraph network. Prior to the War the telegraph systems were primarily used in the commercial sector. Government buildings were not inter-connected with telegraph lines, but relied on runners to carry messages back and forth.{{sfn|Schwoch|2018}} Before the war the Government saw no need to connect lines within city limits, however, they did see the use in connections between cities. Washington D.C. being the hub of government, it had the most connections, but there were only a few lines running north and south out of the city.{{sfn|Schwoch|2018}} It wasn't until the Civil War that the government saw the true potential of the telegraph system. Soon after the shelling of [[Fort Sumter]], the South cut telegraph lines running into D.C., which put the city in a state of panic because they feared an immediate Southern invasion.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}{{sfn|Schwoch|2018}}\n\nWithin 6 months of the start of the war, the [[U.S. Military Telegraph Corps]] (USMT) had laid approximately 300 miles of line. By war's end they had laid approximately 15,000 miles of line, 8,000 for military and 5,000 for commercial use, and had handled approximately 6.5 million messages. The telegraph was not only important for communication within the armed forces, but also in the civilian sector, helping political leaders to maintain control over their districts.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}\n\nEven before the war, the [[American Telegraph Company]] censored suspect messages informally to block aid to the secession movement. During the war, [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Simon Cameron]], and later [[Edwin Stanton]], wanted control over the telegraph lines to maintain the flow of information. Early in the war, one of Stanton's first acts as Secretary of War was to move telegraph lines from ending at [[George B. McClellan|McClellan's]] headquarters to terminating at the War Department. Stanton himself said \"[telegraphy] is my right arm\". Telegraphy assisted Northern victories, including the [[Battle of Antietam]] (1862), the [[Battle of Chickamauga]] (1863), and [[Sherman's March to the Sea]] (1865).{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}\n\nThe telegraph system still had its flaws. The USMT, while the main source of telegraphers and cable, was still a civilian agency. Most operators were first hired by the telegraph companies and then contracted out to the War Department. This created tension between Generals and their operators. One source of irritation was that USMT operators did not have to follow military authority. Usually they performed without hesitation, but they were not required to, so [[Albert J. Myer|Albert Myer]] created a [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Signal Corps]] in February 1863. As the new head of the Signal Corps, Myer tried to get all telegraph and flag signaling under his command, and therefore subject to military discipline. After creating the Signal Corps, Myer pushed to further develop new telegraph systems. While the USMT relied primarily on civilian lines and operators, the Signal Corp's new field telegraph could be deployed and dismantled faster than USMT's system.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}\n\n===First World War===\nDuring [[World War I]], Britain's telegraph communications were almost completely uninterrupted, while it was able to quickly cut Germany's cables worldwide.{{sfn|Kennedy|1971}} The British government censored telegraph cable companies in an effort to root out espionage and restrict financial transactions with Central Powers nations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hills|first=Jill|date=June 2006|title=What's New?

The Germans developed a highly complex teleprinter attachment (German: ''Schl\u00fcssel-Zusatz'') that was used for enciphering telegrams between German High Command ([[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|OKW]]) and the army groups in the field. These contained situation reports, battle plans, and discussions of strategy and tactics. Britain intercepted these signals, diagnosed how the encrypting machine worked, and [[Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher|decrypted]] a large amount of teleprinter traffic.{{sfn|Copeland|2006|pp=1-6}}\n\n==End of the telegraph era==\n{{further|Telegraphy}}\nIn America, the end of the telegraph era can be associated with the fall of the [[Western Union|Western Union Telegraph Company]]. Western Union was the leading telegraph provider for America and was seen as the best competition for the [[Bell Telephone Company|National Bell Telephone Company]]. Western Union and Bell were both invested in telegraphy and telephone technology. Western Union's decision to allow Bell to gain the advantage in telephone technology was the result of Western Union's upper management's failure to foresee the surpassing of the telephone over the, at the time, dominant telegraph system. Western Union soon lost the legal battle for the rights to their telephone copyrights. This led to Western Union agreeing to a lesser position in the telephone competition, which in turn led to the lessening of the telegraph.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}\n\nWhile the telegraph was not the focus of the legal battles that occurred around 1878, the companies that were affected by the effects of the battle were the main powers of telegraphy at the time. Western Union thought that the agreement of 1878 would solidify telegraphy as the long-range communication of choice. However, due to the underestimates of telegraph's future{{explain|date=October 2019}} and poor contracts, Western Union found itself declining.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}} [[AT&T]] acquired working control of Western Union in 1909 but relinquished it in 1914 under threat of antitrust action.  AT&T bought Western Union's electronic mail and [[Telex]] businesses in 1990.\n\nAlthough commercial \"telegraph\" services are still available in [[Worldwide use of telegrams by country|many countries]], transmission is usually done by some form of [[data transmission]] other than traditional telegraphy.\n\n==See also==\n* [[92 Code]]\n* [[Aurora (astronomy)#Auroral events of historical significance|Aurora (astronomy)]]\n* [[Geomagnetically induced current]]\n* [[Great Northern Telegraph Company]]\n* [[Harrison Gray Dyar]], who supposedly erected the first telegraph line and dispatched the first telegram\n* [[Neutral direct-current telegraph system]]\n* [[Western Electric Company]]\n* [[Wireless telegraphy]]\n* [[American Telephone and Telegraph Company]] (AT&T)\n* [[Bell Canada]]\n* [[Speedwell Ironworks]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*{{Citation |last = Beauchamp |first = Ken |title = History Of Telegraphy |place = London |publisher = The Institution Of Electrical Engineers |year = 2001 |isbn = 978-0-85296-792-8 }}\n*Bowers, Brian, ''Sir Charles Wheatstone: 1802\u20131875'', IET, 2001 {{ISBN|0852961030}}.\n*{{Citation | last = Calvert | first = J.

There were many different electrical telegraph systems invented, but the ones that became widespread fit into two broad categories.  The first category consists of [[needle telegraph]]s in which a needle pointer is made to move electromagnetically with a pulse of [[electric current]] from a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] or [[dynamo]] down the telegraph line.  Early systems used multiple needles requiring multiple wires.  The first commercial system, and the most widely used needle telegraph, was the [[Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph]], invented in 1837.  Early equipment sets used five needles to point to the letter being transmitted, but the cost of installing wires was more economically significant than the cost of training operators so a single-needle system with a code that had to be learned became the norm.\n\nThe second category consists of armature systems in which the pulse activates a [[telegraph sounder]] which makes a click.  The archetype of this category was the Morse system, invented by [[Samuel Morse]] in 1838, using a single wire.  At the sending station, an operator would tap on a switch called a [[telegraph key]], spelling out text messages in [[Morse code]].  Originally, the armature was intended to make marks on paper tape, but operators learned to interpret the clicks and it was more efficient to write down the message directly.  In 1865, the Morse system became the standard for international communication with a modified code developed for German railways.  However, some countries continued to use established national systems internally for some time afterwards.\n\nIn the 1840s the electrical telegraph superseded [[optical telegraph]] systems (except in France), becoming the standard way to send urgent messages.  By the latter half of the century, most developed nations had created commercial telegraph networks with local [[telegraph office]]s in most cities and towns, allowing the public to send messages called [[telegram]]s addressed to any person in the country, for a fee.  Beginning in 1854 [[submarine telegraph cable]]s allowed for the first rapid communication between continents. Electrical telegraph networks permitted people and commerce to transmit messages across both continents and oceans almost instantly, with widespread social and economic impacts.<ref>{{Citation|last= Tancia |title= A History of Telegraphy |year= 2014 |url= https://www.pens.co.uk/pen2paper/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/A-History-of-Telegraphy.pdf }}</ref>  In the early 20th century the telegraph was slowly replaced by [[Teleprinter|teletype]] networks.\n\n== History ==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[List of basic communication topics]] -->\n\n===Early work===\n[[File:Soemmerring 1810 telegraph overview.jpg|thumb|S\u00f6mmering's electric telegraph in 1809]]\nFrom early studies of electricity, electrical phenomena were known to travel with great speed, and many experimenters worked on the application of electricity to [[communication]]s at a distance. All the known effects of electricity\u2014such as [[electric spark|sparks]], [[electrostatic attraction]], [[chemical change]]s, [[electric shock]]s, and later [[electromagnetism]]\u2014were applied to the problems of detecting controlled transmissions of electricity at various distances.<ref>Fahie, p.?</ref>\n\t\nIn 1753, an anonymous writer in the ''[[Scots Magazine]]'' suggested an electrostatic telegraph. Using one wire for each letter of the alphabet, a message could be transmitted by connecting the wire terminals in turn to an electrostatic machine, and observing the deflection of [[pith]] balls at the far end.<ref>E. A. Marland, ''Early Electrical Communication'', Abelard-Schuman Ltd, London 1964, no ISBN, Library of Congress 64-20875, pages 17-19;</ref> The writer has never been positively identified, but the letter was signed C.M. and posted from [[Renfrew]] leading to a Charles Marshall of Renfrew being suggested.<ref>Holzmann & Pehrson, p. 203</ref> Telegraphs employing electrostatic attraction were the basis of early experiments in electrical telegraphy in Europe, but were abandoned as being impractical and were never developed into a useful communication system.<ref>{{Citation | title = Electromagnetic Telegraph - Invented by Baron Pavel Schilling | url = http://www.edubilla.com/invention/electrical-telegraph/ }}</ref>\n\nIn 1774, [[Georges-Louis Le Sage]] realised an early electric telegraph. The telegraph had a separate wire for each of the 26 letters of the [[alphabet]] and its range was only between two rooms of his home.<ref>Prevost, 1805, pp. 176-178</ref>\n\nIn 1800, [[Alessandro Volta]] invented the [[voltaic pile]], allowing for a [[continuous current]] of [[electricity]] for experimentation. This became a source of a low-voltage current that could be used to produce more distinct effects, and which was far less limited than the momentary discharge of an [[electrostatic generator|electrostatic machine]], which with [[Leyden jar]]s were the only previously known man-made sources of electricity.\n\t \t\nAnother very early experiment in electrical telegraphy was an 'electrochemical telegraph' created by the [[Germans|German]] physician, anatomist and inventor [[Samuel Thomas von S\u00f6mmering]] in 1809, based on an earlier, less robust design of 1804 by Spanish [[polymath]] and scientist [[Francisco Salva Campillo]].{{sfn|Jones|1999}} Both their designs employed multiple wires (up to 35) to represent almost all Latin letters and numerals. Thus, messages could be conveyed electrically up to a few kilometers (in von S\u00f6mmering's design), with each of the telegraph receiver's wires immersed in a separate glass tube of acid. An electric current was sequentially applied by the sender through the various wires representing each letter of a message; at the recipient's end the currents electrolysed the acid in the tubes in sequence, releasing streams of hydrogen bubbles next to each associated letter or numeral. The telegraph receiver's operator would watch the bubbles and could then record the transmitted message.{{sfn|Jones|1999}} This is in contrast to later telegraphs that used a single wire (with ground return).\n\t \t\n[[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]] discovered in 1820 that an electric current produces a magnetic field that will deflect a compass needle. In the same year [[Johann Schweigger]] invented the [[galvanometer]], with a coil of wire around a compass, which could be used as a sensitive indicator for an electric current.<ref>M. (10 December 2014). Schweigger Multiplier \u2013 1820.

The receiving instrument consisted of six [[galvanometer]]s with magnetic needles, suspended from [[silk]] [[Yarn|threads]]. Both stations of Schilling's telegraph were connected by eight wires; six were connected with the [[galvanometer]]s, one served for the return current and one for a signal bell. When at the starting station the operator pressed a key, the corresponding pointer was deflected at the receiving station. Different positions of black and white flags on different disks gave combinations which corresponded to the letters or numbers. Pavel Schilling subsequently improved its apparatus by reducing the number of connecting wires from eight to two.\n\t \t\nOn 21 October 1832, Schilling managed a short-distance transmission of signals between two telegraphs in different rooms of his apartment. In 1836, the British government attempted to buy the design but Schilling instead accepted overtures from [[Nicholas&nbsp;I of Russia]]. Schilling's telegraph was tested on a {{convert|5|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} experimental underground and underwater cable, laid around the building of the main Admiralty in Saint Petersburg and was approved for a telegraph between the imperial palace at [[Peterhof Palace|Peterhof]] and the naval base at [[Kronstadt]]. However, the project was cancelled following Schilling's death in 1837.{{sfn|Huurdeman|2003|p=54}} Schilling was also one of the first to put into practice the idea of the [[binary coding|binary]] system of signal transmission.\n\t\nIn 1833, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], together with the physics professor [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Wilhelm Weber]] in [[G\u00f6ttingen]] installed a {{convert|1200|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} wire above the town's roofs. Gauss combined the [[Schweigger multiplier|Poggendorff-Schweigger multiplicator]] with his magnetometer to build a more sensitive device, the [[galvanometer]]. To change the direction of the electric current, he constructed a [[commutator (electric)|commutator]] of his own. As a result, he was able to make the distant needle move in the direction set by the commutator on the other end of the line.\n\n[[File:Diagram of alphabet used in a 5 needle Cooke and Wheatstone Telegraph, indicating the letter G.png|thumb|left|Diagram of alphabet used in a 5 needle Cooke and Wheatstone Telegraph, indicating the letter G]]At first, Gauss and Weber used the telegraph to coordinate time, but soon they developed other signals and finally, their own alphabet. The alphabet was encoded in a binary code which was transmitted by positive or negative voltage pulses which were generated by means of moving an induction coil up and down over a permanent magnet and connecting the coil with the transmission wires by means of the commutator. The page of Gauss' laboratory notebook containing both his code and the first message transmitted, as well as a replica of the telegraph made in the 1850s under the instructions of Weber are kept in the faculty of physics at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]], in Germany.\n\nGauss was convinced that this communication would be a help to his kingdom's towns. Later in the same year, instead of a [[Voltaic pile]], Gauss used an [[Electromagnetic induction|induction]] pulse, enabling him to transmit seven letters a minute instead of two. The inventors and university did not have the funds to develop the telegraph on their own, but they received funding from [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. [[Carl August Steinheil]] in [[Munich]] was able to build a telegraph network within the city in 1835\u20131836. He installed a telegraph line along the first German railroad in 1835.  Steinheil built a telegraph along the [[Nuremberg - F\u00fcrth railway line]] in 1838, the first [[earth-return telegraph]] put into service.\n\nBy 1837, [[William Fothergill Cooke]] and [[Charles Wheatstone]] had co-developed a [[Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph|telegraph system]] which used a number of needles on a board that could be moved to point to letters of the alphabet. Any number of needles could be used, depending on the number of characters it was required to code. In May 1837 they patented their system. The patent recommended five needles, which coded twenty of the alphabet's 26 letters.\n\n[[File:Wallace Study-Telegraph.jpg|thumb|Morse key and sounder]]\n[[Samuel Morse]] independently developed and patented a recording electric telegraph in 1837. Morse's assistant [[Alfred Vail]] developed an instrument that was called the register for recording the received messages. It embossed dots and dashes on a moving paper tape by a stylus which was operated by an electromagnet.{{sfn|Calvert|2008}} Morse and Vail developed the [[Morse code]] signalling [[alphabet]].

System, used mostly on private wires. This consisted of a \"communicator\" at the sending end and an \"indicator\" at the receiving end. The communicator consisted of a circular dial with a pointer and the 26 letters of the alphabet (and four punctuation marks) around its circumference. Against each letter was a key that could be pressed. A transmission would begin with the pointers on the dials at both ends set to the start position. The transmitting operator would then press down the key corresponding to the letter to be transmitted. In the base of the communicator was a [[magneto]] actuated by a handle on the front. This would be turned to apply an alternating voltage to the line. Each half cycle of the current would move the pointers at both ends on by one position. When the pointer reached the position of the depressed key, it would stop and the magneto would be disconnected from the line. The communicator's pointer was geared to the magneto mechanism. The indicator's pointer was moved by a polarised electromagnet whose [[Armature (electrical)|armature]] was coupled to it through an [[escapement]]. Thus the alternating line voltage moved the indicator's pointer on to the position of the depressed key on the communicator. Pressing another key would then release the pointer and the previous key, and re-connect the magneto to the line. These machines were very robust and simple to operate, and they stayed in use in Britain until well into the 20th century.<ref>{{Citation |last= Freebody |first= J.

With different codes, additional operators were required to translate and retransmit the message.  In 1865, a conference in Paris adopted Gerke's code as the International Morse code and was henceforth the international standard.  The US, however, continued to use [[American Morse code]] internally for some time, hence international messages required retransmission in both directions.<ref>Andrew L. Russell, ''Open Standards and the Digital Age'', p. 36, Cambridge University Press, 2014 {{ISBN|1107039193}}.</ref>\n\nIn the United States, the Morse/Vail telegraph was [[timeline of North American telegraphy|quickly deployed in the two decades following the first demonstration]] in 1844.

They had an extensive [[optical telegraph]] system built during the [[Napoleonic era]].  There was also serious concern that an electrical telegraph could be quickly put out of action by enemy saboteurs, something that was much more difficult to do with optical telegraphs which had no exposed hardware between stations.  The [[Foy-Breguet telegraph]] was eventually adopted.  This was a two-needle system using two signal wires, but displayed in a uniquely different way to other needle telegraphs.  The needles made symbols similar to the Chappe optical system symbols, making it more familiar to the telegraph operators.  The optical system was decommissioned starting in 1846, but not completed until 1855.  In that year the Foy-Breguet system was replaced with the Morse system.<ref>Holzmann & Pehrson, pp. 93\u201394</ref>\n\n===Expansion===\nAs well as the rapid expansion of the use of the telegraphs along the railways, they soon spread into the field of mass communication with the instruments being installed in [[post office]]s.

Proce Wellcome V0025510.jpg|thumb|left|Wheatstone automated telegraph network equipment]]\nA continuing goal in telegraphy was to reduce the cost per message by reducing hand-work, or increasing the sending rate.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} There were many experiments with moving pointers, and various electrical encodings. However, most systems were too complicated and unreliable. A successful expedient to reduce the cost per message was the development of [[telegraphese]].\n\nThe first system that didn't require skilled technicians to operate, was Charles Wheatstone's ABC system in 1840 where the letters of the alphabet were arranged around a clock-face, and the signal caused a needle to indicate the letter. This early system required the receiver to be present in real time to record the message and it reached speeds of up to 15 words a minute.\n\nIn 1846, [[Alexander Bain (inventor)|Alexander Bain]] patented a chemical telegraph in Edinburgh. The signal current moved an iron pen across a moving paper tape soaked in a mixture of ammonium nitrate and potassium ferrocyanide, decomposing the chemical and producing readable blue marks in Morse code. The speed of the printing telegraph was 16 and a half words per minute, but messages still required translation into English by live copyists. Chemical telegraphy came to an end in the US in 1851, when the Morse group defeated the Bain patent in the US District Court.<ref>Oslin, George P. The Story of Telecommunications, Mercer University Press, 1992. 69.</ref>\n\nFor a brief period, starting with the New York\u2013Boston line in 1848, some telegraph networks began to employ sound operators, who were trained to understand Morse code aurally. Gradually, the use of sound operators eliminated the need for telegraph receivers to include register and tape. Instead, the receiving instrument was developed into a \"sounder\", an electromagnet that was energized by a current and attracted a small iron lever. When the sounding key was opened or closed, the sounder lever struck an anvil. The Morse operator distinguished a dot and a dash by the short or long interval between the two clicks. The message was then written out in long-hand.<ref>Oslin, George P. The Story of Telecommunications. Mercer University Press, 1992. 67</ref>\n\n[[Royal Earl House]] developed and patented a letter-printing telegraph system in 1846 which employed an alphabetic keyboard for the transmitter and automatically printed the letters on paper at the receiver,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.gatunka.com/2014/04/14/letter-printing-telegraph-us-patent-4464/|title=Royal Earl House Printing-Telegraph Patent #4464, 1846|accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref> and followed this up with a steam-powered version in 1852.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.gatunka.com/2014/04/15/steam-powered-letter-printing-telegraph-us-patent-9505/|title=Royal Earl House Steam-Powered Printing-Telegraph Patent #9505, 1852|accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref> Advocates of printing telegraphy said it would eliminate Morse operators' errors.

The Story of Telecommunications, 1992. 71</ref>\n\n[[File:Clavier Baudot.jpg|thumb|200px|upright=1.5|A Baudot keyboard, 1884]]\n[[David Edward Hughes]] invented the printing telegraph in 1855; it used a keyboard of 26 keys for the alphabet and a spinning type wheel that determined the letter being transmitted by the length of time that had elapsed since the previous transmission. The system allowed for automatic recording on the receiving end. The system was very stable and accurate and became accepted around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/hughes.html|title=David Edward Hughes|accessdate=2010-09-29|date=14 April 2007|publisher=Clarkson University|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422072443/http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/hughes.html|archivedate=2008-04-22}}</ref>\n\nThe next improvement was the [[Baudot code]] of 1874. French engineer [[\u00c9mile Baudot]] patented a printing telegraph in which the signals were translated automatically into typographic characters. Each character was assigned a five-bit code, mechanically interpreted from the state of five on/off switches. Operators had to maintain a steady rhythm, and the usual speed of operation was 30 words per minute.{{sfn|Beauchamp|2001|pp=394\u2013395}}\n\nBy this point reception had been automated, but the speed and accuracy of the transmission was still limited to the skill of the human operator. The first practical automated system was patented by Charles Wheatstone, the original inventor of the telegraph. The message (in [[Morse code]]) was typed onto a piece of perforated tape using a keyboard-like device called the 'Stick Punch'. The transmitter automatically ran the tape through and transmitted the message at the then exceptionally high speed of 70 words per minute.\n\n====Teleprinters====\n{{main|Teleprinter|Telex}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2020}}\n[[File:Phelps' Electro-motor Printing Telegraph.jpg|left|thumb|Phelps' Electro-motor Printing Telegraph from circa 1880, the last and most advanced telegraphy mechanism designed by [[George May Phelps]]]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2008-0516-500, Fernschreibmaschine mit Telefonanschluss.jpg|thumb|right|A Creed Model 7 teleprinter in 1930]]\n[[File:Teletype-IMG 7289.jpg|right|thumb|220px|[[Teletype Model 33]] ASR (Automatic Send and Receive)]]\nAn early successful [[teleprinter]] was invented by [[Frederick G. Creed]]. In [[Glasgow]] he created his first keyboard perforator, which used compressed air to punch the holes. He also created a reperforator (receiving perforator) and a printer. The reperforator punched incoming Morse signals on to paper tape and the printer decoded this tape to produce alphanumeric characters on plain paper. This was the origin of the Creed High Speed Automatic Printing System, which could run at an unprecedented 200 words per minute. His system was adopted by the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' for daily transmission of the newspaper contents.\n\nWith the invention of the [[teletypewriter]], telegraphic encoding became fully automated. Early teletypewriters used the ITA-1 [[Baudot code]], a five-bit code. This yielded only thirty-two codes, so it was over-defined into two \"shifts\", \"letters\" and \"figures\". An explicit, unshared shift code prefaced each set of letters and figures. In 1901, Baudot's code was modified by [[Donald Murray (inventor)|Donald Murray]].\n\nIn the 1930s teleprinters were produced by [[Teletype Corporation|Teletype]] in the US, [[Creed & Company|Creed]] in Britain and [[Siemens]] in Germany.\n\nBy 1935, message routing was the last great barrier to full automation. Large telegraphy providers began to develop systems that used [[telephone exchange|telephone-like rotary dialling]] to connect teletypewriters. These resulting system was called \"Telex\" (TELegraph EXchange). Telex machines first performed rotary-telephone-style [[pulse dialling]] for [[circuit switching]], and then sent data by [[ITA2]]. This \"type A\" Telex routing functionally automated message routing.\n\nThe first wide-coverage Telex network was implemented in Germany during the 1930s{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} as a network used to communicate within the government.\n\nAt the rate of 45.45 (\u00b10.5%) [[baud]] \u2014 considered speedy at the time \u2014 up to 25 telex channels could share a single long-distance telephone channel by using ''[[voice frequency telegraphy]] [[frequency-division multiplexing|multiplexing]]'', making telex the least expensive method of reliable long-distance communication.\n\nAutomatic teleprinter exchange service was introduced into Canada by [[CPR Telegraphs]] and [[CN Telegraph]] in July 1957 and in 1958, [[Western Union]] started to build a Telex network in the United States.<ref>Phillip R. Easterlin, \"Telex in New York\", Western Union Technical Review, April 1959: 45</ref>\n\n====The harmonic telegraph====\n{{main|Invention of the telephone}}\n{{see also|Acoustic telegraphy}}\nThe most expensive aspect of a telegraph system was the installation \u2013 the laying of the wire, which was often very long. The costs would be better covered by finding a way to send more than one message at a time through the single wire, thus increasing revenue per wire. Early devices included the [[duplex (telegraph)|duplex]] and the [[Quadruplex telegraph|quadruplex]] which allowed, respectively, one or two telegraph transmissions in each direction.  However, an even greater number of channels was desired on the busiest lines.  In the latter half of the 1800s, several inventors worked towards creating a method for doing just that, including [[Charles Bourseul]], [[Thomas Edison]], [[Elisha Gray]], and [[Alexander Graham Bell]].\n\nOne approach was to have resonators of several different frequencies act as carriers of a modulated on-off signal.  This was the harmonic telegraph, a form of [[Multiplexing#Frequency-division multiplexing|frequency-division multiplexing]]. These various frequencies, referred to as harmonics, could then be combined into one complex signal and sent down the single wire. On the receiving end, the frequencies would be separated with a matching set of resonators.\n\nWith a set of frequencies being carried down a single wire, it was realized that the human voice itself could be transmitted electrically through the wire. This effort led to the [[invention of the telephone]]. (While the work toward packing multiple telegraph signals onto one wire led to telephony, later advances would pack multiple voice signals onto one wire by increasing the bandwidth by modulating frequencies much higher than human hearing. Eventually the bandwidth was widened much further by using laser light signals sent through fiber optic cables. Fiber optic transmission can carry 25,000 telephone signals simultaneously down a single fiber.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.explainthatstuff.com/fiberoptics.html |title = How does fiber optics work?}}</ref>)\n\n===Oceanic telegraph cables===\n[[File:1891 Telegraph Lines.jpg|right|thumb|333px|Major telegraph lines in 1891.]]\n{{Main|Transatlantic telegraph cable||Submarine communications cable}}\nSoon after the first successful telegraph systems were operational, the possibility of transmitting messages across the sea by way of [[submarine communications cable]]s was first proposed. One of the primary technical challenges was to sufficiently insulate the submarine cable to prevent the current from leaking out into the water. In 1842, a Scottish surgeon [[William Montgomerie]]<ref name=Haigh26>{{cite book|last=Haigh|first=K R|title=Cable Ships and Submarine Cables|year=1968|publisher=Adlard Coles Ltd|location=London|pages=26\u201327}}</ref> introduced [[gutta-percha]], the adhesive juice of the ''[[Palaquium gutta]]'' tree, to Europe. [[Michael Faraday]] and Wheatstone soon discovered the merits of gutta-percha as an insulator, and in 1845, the latter suggested that it should be employed to cover the wire which was proposed to be laid from [[Dover]] to [[Calais]]. Gutta-percha was used as insulation on a wire laid across the [[Rhine]] between [[Cologne-Deutz|Deutz]] and [[Cologne]].<ref>Bright, Charles (1898).

Secret messages were encoded, so interception alone would not be sufficient for the opposing side to gain an advantage. There were geographical constraints on intercepting the telegraph cables, but once radio was used, interception could be much more widespread.\n\n===Crimean war===\nThe [[Crimean War]] was one of the first conflicts to use [[Telegraphy|telegraphs]] and was one of the first to be documented extensively. In 1854, the government in London created a military Telegraph Detachment for the Army commanded by an officer of the [[Royal Engineers]]. It was to comprise twenty-five men from the Royal Corps of Sappers & Miners trained by the Electric Telegraph Company to construct and work the first field electric telegraph.<ref>{{Citation |last= Roberts |first= Steven |title = Distant Writing A History of Telegraph Companies in Britain between 1838 and 1868: 16.

After the French extended the telegraph to the coast of the Black Sea in late 1854, the news reached [[London]] in two days. When the British laid an underwater cable to the Crimean peninsula in April 1855, news reached London in a few hours. The daily news reports energised public opinion, which brought down the government and led to Lord Palmerston becoming prime minister.{{sfn|Figes|2010|pp=304\u201311}}\n\n===American Civil War===\nDuring the [[American Civil War]] the telegraph proved its value as a tactical, operational, and strategic communication medium and an important contributor to Union victory.<ref>{{Citation |last= Hochfelder |first= David |title= Essential Civil WAR Curriculum: The Telegraph |publisher= Virginia Center for Civil War Studies at Virginia Tech |year= 2019 |url= https://www.essentialcivilwarcurriculum.com/the-telegraph.html }}</ref> By contrast the Confederacy failed to make effective use of the South's much smaller telegraph network. Prior to the War the telegraph systems were primarily used in the commercial sector. Government buildings were not inter-connected with telegraph lines, but relied on runners to carry messages back and forth.{{sfn|Schwoch|2018}} Before the war the Government saw no need to connect lines within city limits, however, they did see the use in connections between cities. Washington D.C. being the hub of government, it had the most connections, but there were only a few lines running north and south out of the city.{{sfn|Schwoch|2018}} It wasn't until the Civil War that the government saw the true potential of the telegraph system. Soon after the shelling of [[Fort Sumter]], the South cut telegraph lines running into D.C., which put the city in a state of panic because they feared an immediate Southern invasion.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}{{sfn|Schwoch|2018}}\n\nWithin 6 months of the start of the war, the [[U.S. Military Telegraph Corps]] (USMT) had laid approximately 300 miles of line. By war's end they had laid approximately 15,000 miles of line, 8,000 for military and 5,000 for commercial use, and had handled approximately 6.5 million messages. The telegraph was not only important for communication within the armed forces, but also in the civilian sector, helping political leaders to maintain control over their districts.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}\n\nEven before the war, the [[American Telegraph Company]] censored suspect messages informally to block aid to the secession movement. During the war, [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Simon Cameron]], and later [[Edwin Stanton]], wanted control over the telegraph lines to maintain the flow of information. Early in the war, one of Stanton's first acts as Secretary of War was to move telegraph lines from ending at [[George B. McClellan|McClellan's]] headquarters to terminating at the War Department. Stanton himself said \"[telegraphy] is my right arm\". Telegraphy assisted Northern victories, including the [[Battle of Antietam]] (1862), the [[Battle of Chickamauga]] (1863), and [[Sherman's March to the Sea]] (1865).{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}\n\nThe telegraph system still had its flaws. The USMT, while the main source of telegraphers and cable, was still a civilian agency. Most operators were first hired by the telegraph companies and then contracted out to the War Department. This created tension between Generals and their operators. One source of irritation was that USMT operators did not have to follow military authority. Usually they performed without hesitation, but they were not required to, so [[Albert J. Myer|Albert Myer]] created a [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Signal Corps]] in February 1863. As the new head of the Signal Corps, Myer tried to get all telegraph and flag signaling under his command, and therefore subject to military discipline. After creating the Signal Corps, Myer pushed to further develop new telegraph systems. While the USMT relied primarily on civilian lines and operators, the Signal Corp's new field telegraph could be deployed and dismantled faster than USMT's system.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}\n\n===First World War===\nDuring [[World War I]], Britain's telegraph communications were almost completely uninterrupted, while it was able to quickly cut Germany's cables worldwide.{{sfn|Kennedy|1971}} The British government censored telegraph cable companies in an effort to root out espionage and restrict financial transactions with Central Powers nations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hills|first=Jill|date=June 2006|title=What's New?

The Germans developed a highly complex teleprinter attachment (German: ''Schl\u00fcssel-Zusatz'') that was used for enciphering telegrams between German High Command ([[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|OKW]]) and the army groups in the field. These contained situation reports, battle plans, and discussions of strategy and tactics. Britain intercepted these signals, diagnosed how the encrypting machine worked, and [[Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher|decrypted]] a large amount of teleprinter traffic.{{sfn|Copeland|2006|pp=1-6}}\n\n==End of the telegraph era==\n{{further|Telegraphy}}\nIn America, the end of the telegraph era can be associated with the fall of the [[Western Union|Western Union Telegraph Company]]. Western Union was the leading telegraph provider for America and was seen as the best competition for the [[Bell Telephone Company|National Bell Telephone Company]]. Western Union and Bell were both invested in telegraphy and telephone technology. Western Union's decision to allow Bell to gain the advantage in telephone technology was the result of Western Union's upper management's failure to foresee the surpassing of the telephone over the, at the time, dominant telegraph system. Western Union soon lost the legal battle for the rights to their telephone copyrights. This led to Western Union agreeing to a lesser position in the telephone competition, which in turn led to the lessening of the telegraph.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}\n\nWhile the telegraph was not the focus of the legal battles that occurred around 1878, the companies that were affected by the effects of the battle were the main powers of telegraphy at the time. Western Union thought that the agreement of 1878 would solidify telegraphy as the long-range communication of choice. However, due to the underestimates of telegraph's future{{explain|date=October 2019}} and poor contracts, Western Union found itself declining.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}} [[AT&T]] acquired working control of Western Union in 1909 but relinquished it in 1914 under threat of antitrust action.  AT&T bought Western Union's electronic mail and [[Telex]] businesses in 1990.\n\nAlthough commercial \"telegraph\" services are still available in [[Worldwide use of telegrams by country|many countries]], transmission is usually done by some form of [[data transmission]] other than traditional telegraphy.\n\n==See also==\n* [[92 Code]]\n* [[Aurora (astronomy)#Auroral events of historical significance|Aurora (astronomy)]]\n* [[Geomagnetically induced current]]\n* [[Great Northern Telegraph Company]]\n* [[Harrison Gray Dyar]], who supposedly erected the first telegraph line and dispatched the first telegram\n* [[Neutral direct-current telegraph system]]\n* [[Western Electric Company]]\n* [[Wireless telegraphy]]\n* [[American Telephone and Telegraph Company]] (AT&T)\n* [[Bell Canada]]\n* [[Speedwell Ironworks]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*{{Citation |last = Beauchamp |first = Ken |title = History Of Telegraphy |place = London |publisher = The Institution Of Electrical Engineers |year = 2001 |isbn = 978-0-85296-792-8 }}\n*Bowers, Brian, ''Sir Charles Wheatstone: 1802\u20131875'', IET, 2001 {{ISBN|0852961030}}.\n*{{Citation | last = Calvert | first = J.
