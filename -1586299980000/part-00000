Derby, bankrolled by wealthy new chairman [[Lionel Pickering]], were spending heavily as they looked to win [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]] from the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] to the new super league, and ironically one of their biggest promotion rivals were Kitson's former club and arguably Derby's biggest rivals \u2013 Leicester City. Kitson scored four times in 12 appearances as the 1991\u201392 season drew to a close, but defeat to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] in the [[playoffs]] semifinals meant that third placed Derby would be denied a [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]] playoff final meeting with Kitson's former club and most crucially the chance of a place in the new Premier League.\n\nFurther heavy spending followed this disappointment, but Derby failed to make a serious challenge for promotion from the new Division One (which they had been widely expected to dominate) in [[1992\u201393 in English football|1992\u201393]] but it was still a good personal season for Kitson, who scored 17 times in 44 league games.

It was ordered to prepare for war in the event that negotiations with the United States did not succeed in peacefully meeting Japanese objectives. Under Terauchi's command were four corps-equivalent armies, comprising ten divisions and three combined arms brigades, including the [[Japanese Fourteenth Area Army]]. Operations against the Philippines and Malaya were to be conducted simultaneously when Imperial General Headquarters ordered.\n\nThe invasion of the Philippines had three objectives:\n* To prevent the use of the Philippines as an advance base of operations by American forces\n* To acquire staging areas and supply bases to enhance operations against the Netherlands East Indies\n* To secure the lines of communication between occupied areas in the south and the Japanese Home Islands.\n\n====Invasion forces====\n[[File:Advance Japanese Landings Dec 1941.jpg|thumb|300 px|Advance Japanese landings in the Philippines 8\u201320 December 1941]]\nTerauchi assigned the Philippines invasion to the 14th Army, under the command of Lieutenant General [[Masaharu Homma]].<ref name=Chun>Chun, C., 2012, The Fall of the Philippines, 1941-1942, Oxford: Osprey Publishing, {{ISBN|978-1-84908-609-7}}</ref>{{rp|14,20}} Air support of ground operations was provided by the 5th Air Group, under Lieutenant General [[Hideyoshi Obata]],<ref name=Chun/>{{rp|21}} which was transferred to Formosa from Manchuria.

Tactically the FEAF was part of the Reserve Force, so that it fell under MacArthur's direct command.\n\nAs of 30 November 1941, the strength of US Army Troops in the Philippines, including Philippine units, was 31,095, consisting of 2,504 officers and\n28,591 enlisted (16,643 Americans and 11,957 Philippine Scouts).<ref>[http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/5-2/5-2_3.htm#p49 STRENGTH AND COMPOSITION OF U.S. ARMY TROOPS IN PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, 30 NOVEMBER 1941]</ref>\n\n====Mobilization====\nMacArthur's mobilization plans called for induction of the ten reserve divisions between 1 September and 15 December 1941. The timetable was met on 1 September with the induction of one regiment per division, but slowed as a lack of facilities and equipment hampered training. The second regiments of the divisions were not called up until 1 November, and the third regiments were not organized until after hostilities began. Training was also seriously inhibited by language difficulties between the American cadres and the Filipino troops, and by the many differing dialects (estimated at 70) of the numerous ethnic groups comprising the army. By the outbreak of war, only two-thirds of the army had been mobilized, but additions to the force continued with the induction of the Constabulary and a portion of the regular army, until a force of approximately 130,000 men was reached.\n\nThe most crucial equipment shortfalls were in rifles and divisional light artillery. MacArthur requested 84,500 [[M1 Garand]] rifles to replace the World War I [[M1917 Enfield]]s equipping the PA, of which there were adequate numbers, but the War Department denied the request because of production difficulties. The divisions had only 20% of their artillery requirements, and while plans had been approved to significantly reduce this gap, the arrangements came too late to be implemented before war isolated the Philippines.<ref>[http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/5-2/5-2_3.htm#p32 ''The Fall of the Philippines''], p. 35-36.</ref>\n\nBy contrast, the Philippine Division was adequately manned, equipped, and trained. MacArthur received immediate approval to modernize it by reorganizing it as a mobile \"triangular\" division. Increasing the authorized size of the Philippine Scouts was not politically viable (because of resentments within the less-well-paid Philippine Army), so MacArthur's plan also provided for freeing up Philippine Scouts to round out other units. The transfer of the American [[34th Infantry Regiment (United States)|34th Infantry]] from the [[8th Infantry Division (United States)|8th Infantry Division]] in the United States to the Philippine Division, accompanied by two field artillery battalions to create a pair of complete [[regimental combat team]]s, was actually underway when war broke out. The deployment ended with the troops still in the United States, where they were sent to defend Hawaii instead.\n\n====Other defense forces====\nThe [[United States Asiatic Fleet]] and [[United States Naval Districts|16th Naval District]], based at Manila, provided the naval defenses for the Philippines. Commanded by Admiral [[Thomas C. Hart]], the surface combatants of the Asiatic Fleet were the heavy cruiser {{USS|Houston|CA-30|6}}, the light cruiser {{USS|Marblehead|CL-12|6}}, and 13 [[Clemson-class destroyer|World War I-era destroyers]].<ref>[http://www.asiaticfleet.com/orbat.htm United States Asiatic Fleet], complete Order of Battle including patrol craft of 16th Naval District.</ref> Its primary striking power lay in the 23 modern submarines assigned to the Asiatic Fleet. Submarine Squadron (SUBRON) Two consisted of 6 [[Salmon class submarine]]s, and SUBRON Five of 11 [[United States Porpoise class submarine|Porpoise]] and [[Sargo class submarine]]s. In September 1941, naval patrol forces in the Philippines were augmented by the arrival of the six [[PT boat]]s of [[Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three]]. Likewise, the China [[Yangtze Patrol]] gunboats also became part of the Philippine naval defenses: {{USS|Asheville|PG-21|6}} (sunk south of Java 3 March 1942), {{USS|Mindanao|PR-8|6}} (lost 2 May 1942), {{USS|Luzon|PG-47|6}} (scuttled 6 May 1942 but salvaged by the Japanese), {{USS|Oahu|PR-6|6}} (sunk 5 May 1942), and {{USS|Quail|AM-15|6}} (scuttled 5 May 1942). In December 1941, the naval forces were augmented by the schooner {{USS|Lanikai|1914|6}}.\n\nThe U.S. [[4th Marine Regiment]], stationed in Shanghai, China, since the late 1920s, had anticipated a withdrawal from China during the summer of 1941. As personnel were routinely transferred back to the United States or separated from the service, the regimental commander, Col. [[Samuel L. Howard]], arranged unofficially for all replacements to be placed in the 1st Special Defense Battalion, based at [[Cavite]]. When the 4th Marines arrived in the Philippines on 30 November 1941, it incorporated the Marines at Cavite and [[Olongapo Naval Station]]s into its understrength ranks.<ref>[http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/5-2/5-2_29.htm#p527 ''The Fall of the Philippines''], p. 528-529. The [[Beijing|Peking]] and [[Chinwangtao]] detachments of the 4th were stranded in China by the onset of war. The 4th Marines had only two battalions, each organized into a machine gun company and two rifle companies of only two platoons each. The amalgamation of the 1st Special Defense Battalion, Cavite, enabled the 4th to organize a third battalion, and Marines of the Marine Barracks Olangapo enabled the 1st and 2nd Battalions to field three rifle companies of three platoons each.</ref> An initial plan to divide the 4th into two regiments, mixing each with a battalion of Philippine Constabulary, was discarded after Howard showed reluctance, and the 4th was stationed on [[Corregidor]] to augment the defenses there, with details detached to Bataan to protect USAFFE headquarters.\n\nAdditionally the U.S. [[Coast and Geodetic Survey]], a paramilitary survey force, operated in [[Manila]] with the ship [[USC&GSS Pathfinder (1899\u20131941)|USC&GSS ''Research'']].<ref Name=Pt5>{{cite web |url=http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/web/about_ngs/history/WWII-HISTORY-DOC-5-CGS.pdf |title=World War II History of the Department Of Commerce-Part 5 U.S. Coast And Geodetic Survey |author=Coast And Geodetic Survey |year=1951 |website= |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |accessdate=27 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Far East Air Force controversy==\nNews reached the Philippines that an [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] was in progress at 2:20&nbsp;am local time on 8 December 1941.<ref name=Couttie2009p101>{{cite book |title=\"Chew the Bones: Maddog Essays on Philippine History |chapter=17.

In the meantime, Japanese plans to attack Clark and Iba Fields using land-based naval bombers and [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|Zero]] fighters were delayed six hours by fog at its Formosa bases, so that only a small scale Japanese Army mission attacked targets in the northern tip of Luzon. At 08:00&nbsp;am, Brereton received a phone call from Gen. [[Henry H. Arnold]] warning him not to allow his aircraft to be attacked while still on the ground. FEAF launched three squadron-sized fighter patrols and all of its serviceable bombers on Luzon between 08:00 and 08:30&nbsp;am as a precautionary move.<ref name=\"wde\">{{cite book |last=Edmunds |first=Walter D. |authorlink= |year=1992 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=SX0OOdZEZTIC&pg=PA57&lpg=PA57&dq=Arnold+%22Brereton%22#v=onepage&q=Arnold%20%22Brereton%22&f=false |title=They Fought With What They Had |work= |accessdate=28 January 2011 |isbn=9781428915411}}, p. 77.</ref> After MacArthur gave Brereton the authorization he sought at 10:15&nbsp;am, the bombers were ordered to land and prepare for the afternoon raid on Formosa. All three pursuit squadrons began to run short on fuel and broke off their patrols at the same time.\n\nThe 20th Pursuit Squadron's [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|Curtiss P-40B]] interceptors patrolled the area while the bombers landed at [[Clark Air Base|Clark Field]] between 10:30 and 10:45, then dispersed to their revetments for servicing.<ref name=\"lmcf\"/> The 17th Pursuit Squadron, based at [[Nichols Field]], also landed at Clark and had its aircraft refueled while its pilots ate lunch, then put its pilots on alert shortly after 11:00.<ref>Edmunds, p. 83.</ref> All but two of the Clark Field B-17s were on the ground.<ref>Edmunds, p. 84.

It alerted FEAF headquarters and the command post at Clark Field, a warning that reached only the pursuit group commander, Major Orrin L. Grover, who apparently became confused by multiple and conflicting reports.<ref name=\"lmcf\"/><ref name=\"Correll, Caught on the Ground\" /> The 3rd Pursuit Squadron took off from Iba at 11:45 with instructions to intercept the western force, which was thought to have Manila as its target, but dust problems during its takeoff resulted in the fragmentation of its flights. Two flights of the 21st Pursuit Squadron (PS) at Nichols Field, six P-40Es, took off at 11:45, led by 1st Lt. [[William Dyess]]. They started for Clark but were diverted to Manila Bay as a second line of defense if the 3rd PS failed to intercept its force. The 21st's third flight, taking off five minutes later, headed toward Clark, although engine problems with its brand-new P-40Es reduced its numbers by two. The 17th Pursuit Squadron took off at 12:15&nbsp;pm from Clark, ordered to patrol Bataan and Manila Bay, while the 34th PS at Del Carmen never received its orders to protect Clark Field and did not launch.<ref>Edmunds, pp. 84\u201385.</ref> The 20th PS, dispersed at Clark, was ready to take off but did not receive orders from group headquarters.

Edmunds interviewed numerous officers present when the attack began.</ref> they achieved tactical surprise. Two squadrons of [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17s]] were dispersed on the ground. Most of the P-40s of the 20th PS were preparing to taxi and were struck by the first wave of 27 Japanese twin-engine [[Mitsubishi G3M]] \"Nell\" bombers; only four of the 20th PS P-40Bs managed to take off as the bombs were falling.\n\nA second bomber attack (26 [[Mitsubishi G4M]] \"Betty\" bombers) followed closely, then escorting Zero fighters strafed the field for 30 minutes, destroying 12 of the 17 American heavy bombers present and seriously damaging three others. Two damaged B-17s were made flyable and taken to Mindanao, where one was destroyed in a ground collision.<ref>Correll, ''Caught on the Ground''.</ref>\n\nA near-simultaneous attack on the auxiliary field at Iba to the northwest by 54 \"Betty\" bombers was also successful: all but four of the 3rd Pursuit Squadron's P-40s, short on fuel and caught in their landing pattern, were destroyed in combat or by lack of fuel.<ref>Edmunds, pp. 95\u201397. Four of the 18 airborne P-40s made Rosario airfield, while a fifth took off from Iba and found refuge there also.</ref> Twelve P-40s from the 20th (four), 21st (two), and 3rd (six) Squadrons attacked the strafers but with little success, losing at least four of their own.\n\nThe Far East Air Force lost half its planes in the 45-minute attack, and was all but destroyed over the next few days, including a number of the surviving B-17s lost to takeoff crashes of other planes.<ref name=\"lmcf\"/> The 24th Pursuit Group flew its last interception on 10 December, losing 11 of the 40 or so P-40s it sent up, and the surviving P-35s of the 34th PS were destroyed on the ground at Del Carmen.<ref>Edmunds, pp. 133\u2013136.</ref> That night FEAF combat strength had been reduced to 12 operable B-17s, 22 P-40s, and 8 P-35s.<ref>Edmunds, p. 138.</ref> Fighter strength fluctuated daily until 24 December, when USAFFE ordered all its forces into Bataan. Until then P-40s and P-35s were cobbled together from spare parts taken from wrecked airplanes, and still crated P-40Es were assembled at the Philippine Air Depot. Clark Field was abandoned as a bomber field on 11 December after being used as a staging base for a handful of B-17 missions.<ref>Edmunds, p. 133.</ref> Between 17 and 20 December, the 14 surviving B-17s were withdrawn to Australia. Every other aircraft of the FEAF was destroyed or captured.<ref>Edmunds, p. 178.</ref>\n\nNo formal investigation took place regarding this failure as occurred in the aftermath of Pearl Harbor. After the war, Brereton and Sutherland in effect blamed each other for FEAF being surprised on the ground, and MacArthur released a statement that he had no knowledge of any recommendation to attack Formosa with B-17s.<ref name=\"lmcf\"/> Walter D. Edmunds summarized the disaster: \"in the Philippines the personnel of our armed forces almost without exception failed to assess accurately the weight, speed, and efficiency of the Japanese Air Force.\" He quoted Maj. Gen. [[Emmett O'Donnell Jr.]], then a major in charge of the B-17s sent to Mindanao, as concluding that the first day was a \"disorganized business\" and that no one was \"really at fault\" because no one was \"geared for war.\"<ref>Edmunds, p. 93.</ref>\n\n==Invasion==\n\n===Initial landings===\n[[File:Invasion of the Philippines, 1941.jpg|thumb|300px|A map of Luzon Island showing Japanese landings and advances from 8 December 1941 to 8 January 1942]]\nThe 14th Army began its invasion with a landing on [[Japanese Invasion of Batan Island|Batan Island]] (not to be confused with Bataan Peninsula), {{convert|120|mi|km}} off the north coast of Luzon, on 8 December 1941, by selected naval infantry units. Landings on [[Camiguin de Babuyanes|Camiguin Island]] and at [[Japanese Invasion of Vigan|Vigan]], [[Aparri, Cagayan|Aparri]], and [[Gonzaga, Cagayan|Gonzaga]] in northern Luzon followed two days later.\n\nTwo B-17s attacked the Japanese ships offloading at Gonzaga. Other B-17s with fighter escort attacked the landings at Vigan. In this last coordinated action of the Far East Air Force, U.S. planes damaged two Japanese transports (''[[Japanese transport Oigawa Maru|Oigawa Maru]]'' and ''[[SS Takao Maru (1927)|Takao Maru]]''), the [[cruiser]] {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Naka||2}}, and the [[destroyer]] {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Murasame|1935|2}}, and sank [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]] ''[[Japanese minesweeper No. 10 (1938)|W-10]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.combinedfleet.com/naka_t.htm |title=HIJMS NAKA: Tabular Record of Movement |author=Bob Hackett and Sander Kingsepp |year=2007 |accessdate=26 September 2007}}</ref>\n\nEarly on the morning of 12 December, the Japanese landed 2,500 men of the 16th Division at [[Legazpi, Albay|Legazpi]] on southern Luzon, {{convert|150|mi|km}} from the nearest American and Philippine forces. The attack on Mindanao followed on 19 December, using elements of the 16th Army temporarily attached to the invasion force to permit the 14th Army to use all its troops on Luzon.\n\nMeanwhile, Admiral [[Thomas C. Hart]] withdrew most of his [[U.S. Asiatic Fleet]] from Philippine waters following Japanese air strikes that inflicted heavy damage on U.S. naval facilities at [[Cavite Navy Yard|Cavite]] on 10 December. Only submarines were left to contest Japanese naval superiority, and the commanders of these, conditioned by prewar doctrine that held the fleet submarine to be a scouting vessel more vulnerable to air and anti-submarine attack than it actually was, proved unequal to the task.\n\nIn a book ''A Different Kind of Victory: A Biography of Admiral Thomas C. Hart'' ([[Naval Institute Press]], 1981), James Leutze wrote:\n\n\"He had 27 subs submerged in [[Manila Bay]],...<ref>Leutze (1981), pages 235</ref> it was Washington, not the Asiatic Fleet Commander that directed the fleet to withdraw from Manila.<ref>Leutze (1981), pages 230</ref>... Hart was directed by Washington to send US Navy surface forces and submarines southeast toward Australia.<ref>Leutze (1981), pages 237</ref>... Douglas MacArthur and [[Henry Stimson]] ([[United States Secretary of War]]) feuding with Admiral Hart over lack of US Navy submarine action. MacArthur asked Admiral Hart: \"What in the world is the matter with your submarines?\".<ref>Leutze (1981), pages 242</ref>.. MacArthur complained that Hart's inactivity allowed Japan's navy freedom of action.<ref>Leutze (1981), pages 234</ref>... According to Stimson, MacArthur felt that Hart's ships and submarines were ineffectual, but because Admiral Hart had lost his courage. Admiral Hart's reaction to MacArthur's brickbats: \"He (MacArthur) is inclined to cut my throat and perhaps the Navy in general.\"<ref>Leutze (1981), pages 240</ref>\"\n\n===Main attack===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\n[[File:Withdrawal South Dec 1941.jpg|thumb|300 px|Withdrawal in the South, 25\u201331 December 1941]]\nThe main attack began early on the morning of 22 December as 43,110 men of the 48th Division and one regiment of the 16th Division, supported by artillery and approximately 90 tanks, landed at three points along the east coast of [[Lingayen Gulf]]. A few B-17s flying from Australia attacked the invasion fleet, and U.S. submarines harassed it from the adjacent waters, but to little effect.\n\nGeneral Wainwright's poorly trained and equipped [[11th Division (Philippines)|11th Division (PA)]] and [[71st Division (Philippines)|71st Division (PA)]] could neither repel the landings nor pin the enemy on the beaches. The remaining Japanese units of the divisions landed farther south along the gulf. The [[26th Cavalry Regiment (Philippine_Scouts)|26th Cavalry (PS)]] of the well-trained and better-equipped [[Philippine Scouts]], advancing to meet them, put up a strong fight at [[Rosario, La Union|Rosario]], but was forced to withdraw after taking heavy casualties with no hope of sufficient reinforcements. By nightfall, 23 December, the Japanese had moved ten miles (16&nbsp;km) into the interior.\n\nThe next day, 7,000 men of the 16th Division hit the beaches at three locations along the shore of [[Lamon Bay]] in southern Luzon, where they found General Parker's forces dispersed, and without artillery protecting the eastern coast, unable to offer serious resistance. They immediately consolidated their positions and began the drive north toward Manila where they would link up with the forces advancing south toward the capital for the final victory.\n\n===Withdrawal into Bataan===\nThe U.S. Philippine Division moved into the field in reaction to reports of airborne drops near Clark Field, and when this proved false, were deployed to cover the withdrawal of troops into Bataan and to resist Japanese advances in the [[Subic Bay]] area.\n\nOn 24 December, MacArthur invoked the prewar plan WPO-3 (War Plan Orange 3), which called for use of five delaying positions in central Luzon while forces withdrew into Bataan. This was carried out in part by the [[26th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|26th Cavalry Regiment]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Merriam |first=Ray |year=1999 |title=War in the Philippines |publisher=Merriam Press |pages=70\u201382 |isbn=1-57638-164-1 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=utbD8wwF91kC |page=70}}\n| accessdate =31 January 2008\n}}</ref> He relieved General Parker of his command of South Luzon Force and had him begin preparing defensive positions on Bataan, using units as they arrived; both the military headquarters and the Philippines government were moved there. Nine days of feverish movement of supplies into Bataan, primarily by barge from Manila, began in an attempt to feed an anticipated force of 43,000 troops for six months. (Ultimately 80,000 troops and 26,000 refugees flooded Bataan.) Nevertheless, substantial forces remained in other areas for several months.\n\n[[File:Macarthur&wainwright.jpg|thumb|200px|Generals Wainwright (left) and MacArthur]]\nUnits of both defense forces were maneuvered to hold open the escape routes into Bataan, in particular [[City of San Fernando, Pampanga|San Fernando]], the steel bridges at [[Calumpit, Bulacan|Calumpit]] over the deep [[Pampanga River]] at the north end of Manila Bay, and [[Plaridel, Bulacan|Plaridel]] north of Manila. The South Luzon Force, despite its inexperience and equivocating orders to withdraw and hold, successfully executed \"[[Bounding overwatch|leapfrogging]]\" [[Withdrawal (military)|retrograde]] techniques and crossed the bridges by 1 January. Japanese air commanders rejected appeals by the 48th Division to bomb the bridges to trap the retreating forces,<ref>[http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/5-2/5-2_12.htm#p205 ''The Fall of the Philippines''], p. 208.</ref> which were subsequently demolished by Philippine Scout engineers on 1 January.\n\nThe Japanese realized the full extent of MacArthur's plan on 30 December and ordered the 48th Division to press forward and seal off Bataan. In a series of actions between 2 and 4 January, the 11th and 21st Divisions of the Philippine Army, the 26th Cavalry (PS) and the American [[M3 Stuart]] tanks of the Provisional Tank Group held open the road from San Fernando to [[Dinalupihan]] at the neck of the peninsula for the retreating forces of the South Luzon Force, then made good their own escape. Despite 50% losses in the 194th Tank Battalion during the retreat, the Stuarts and a supporting battery of [[M3 GMC|75mm SPM halftracks]] repeatedly stopped Japanese thrusts and were the final units to enter Bataan.\n\nOn 30 December, the [[31st Infantry Regiment (United States)|American 31st Infantry]] moved to the vicinity of [[Dalton Pass]] to cover the flanks of troops withdrawing from central and southern Luzon, while other units of the Philippine Division organized positions at Bataan. The 31st Infantry then moved to a defensive position on the west side of the [[Olongapo City|Olongapo]]-Manila road, near [[Layac Junction]]\u2014at the neck of Bataan Peninsula\u2014on 5 January 1942. The junction was given up on 6 January, but the withdrawal to Bataan was successful.\n\n==Battle of Bataan==\n{{Main|Battle of Bataan}}\n[[File:Situation on Bataan 8 Jan 1942.jpg|thumb|300 px|Situation on Bataan, 8 January 1942]]\nFrom 7 to 14 January 1942, the Japanese concentrated on reconnaissance and preparations for an attack on the Main Battle Line from [[Abucay, Bataan|Abucay]] to [[Mount Natib]] to Mauban. At the same time, in a critical mistake, they also relieved the 48th Division, responsible for much of the success of Japanese operations, with the much less-capable 65th Brigade, intended as a garrison force. The Japanese 5th Air group was withdrawn from operations on 5 January in preparation for movement with the 48th Division to the [[Netherlands East Indies]].<ref>[http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/MacArthur%20Reports/MacArthur%20V2%20P1/ch6.htm#p103 Japanese Operations in the Southwest Pacific Area], p.104.</ref> U.S. and Filipino forces repelled night attacks near Abucay, and elements of the U.S. Philippine Division counterattacked on 16 January. This failed, and the division withdrew to the Reserve Battle Line from [[Pilar, Bataan|Casa Pilar]] to [[Bagac, Bataan|Bagac]] in the center of the peninsula on 26 January.\n\nThe 14th Army renewed its attacks on 23 January with an attempted amphibious landing behind the lines by a battalion of the 16th Division, then with general attacks beginning 27 January along the battle line. The amphibious landing was disrupted by a [[PT boat]] and contained in brutally dense jungle by ad hoc units made up of U.S. Army Air Corps troops, naval personnel, and Philippine Constabulary. The pocket was then slowly forced back to the cliffs, with high casualties on both sides. Landings to reinforce the surviving pocket on 26 January and 2 February were severely disrupted by air attacks from the few remaining FEAF P-40s, then trapped and eventually annihilated on 13 February.\n\nA penetration in the I Corps line was stopped and broken up into several pockets. General Homma on 8 February ordered the suspension of offensive operations in order to reorganize his forces. This could not be carried out immediately, because the 16th Division remained engaged trying to extricate a pocketed battalion of its 20th Infantry. With further losses, the remnants of the battalion, 378 officers and men, were extricated on 15 February. On 22 February, the 14th Army line withdrew a few miles to the north and USAFFE forces re-occupied the abandoned positions. The result of the \"Battle of the Points\" and \"Battle of the Pockets\" was total destruction of all three battalions of the Japanese 20th Infantry and a clear USAFFE victory.\n\n[[File:Hayward, California. As Bataan fell, as recorded in these newspapers of April 9, 1942, evacuation o . . . - NARA - 536016.jpg|thumb|California newspapers, 9 April 1942]]\nFor several weeks, the Japanese, deterred by heavy losses and reduced to a single brigade, conducted siege operations while waiting refitting and reinforcement. Both armies engaged in patrols and limited local attacks. Because of the worsening Allied position in the Asia-Pacific region, U.S. President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin D. Roosevelt]] ordered MacArthur to [[Douglas MacArthur's escape from the Philippines|relocate to Australia]], as Supreme Allied Commander [[South West Pacific Area]]. (MacArthur's famous speech regarding the Philippines, in which he said \"I came out of Bataan and I shall return\" was made at [[Terowie, South Australia|Terowie]]\n, [[South Australia]] on 20 March.) Wainwright officially assumed control of what was now termed United States Forces in the Philippines (USFIP) on 23 March. During this period, elements of the U.S. Philippine Division were shifted to assist in the defense of other sectors.\n\nBeginning 28 March, a new wave of Japanese air and artillery attacks hit Allied forces who were severely weakened by malnutrition, sickness and prolonged fighting. On 3 April, the Japanese began to break through along [[Mount Samat]], estimating that the offensive would require a month to end the campaign. The U.S. Philippine Division, no longer operating as a coordinated unit and exhausted by five days of nearly continuous combat, was unable to counterattack effectively against heavy Japanese assaults. On 8 April, the U.S. 57th Infantry Regiment (PS) and the 31st Division PA were overrun near the [[Alangan River]]. The U.S. 45th Infantry Regiment (PS), under orders to reach Mariveles and evacuate to Corregidor, finally surrendered on 10 April 1942. Only 300 men of the U.S. 31st Infantry successfully reached Corregidor.\n\n==Battle of Corregidor==\n{{Main|Battle of Corregidor}}\n[[File:Japanese bombers over Corregidor.jpg|thumb|[[Mitsubishi Ki-21|Japanese bombers]] over Corregidor]]\n[[File:Map of Corregidor 1941.jpg|thumb|left|300 px|Map of Corregidor island in 1941]]\nCorregidor was a U.S. Army Coast Artillery position defending the entrance to Manila Bay. It was armed by both older seacoast [[disappearing gun]] batteries of the [[59th Coast Artillery (United States)|59th]] and [[91st Coast Artillery (United States)|91st Coast Artillery]] Regiments (the latter a Philippine Scouts unit), an offshore mine field of approximately 35 groups of [[controlled mines]],<ref name=CAJHarris1>{{cite journal |last1=Bocksel |first1=Arnold A. |year=1946 |title=The USAMP ''General George Harrison'' in the Harbor Defenses of Manila and Subic Bay |journal=Coast Artillery Journal |volume=LXXXIX |issue=NOVEMBER-DECEMBER 1946 |pages=54 |publisher=United States Coast Artillery Association |url=http://sill-www.army.mil/ada-online/coast-artillery-journal/_docs/1946/11-12/Nov-Dec%201946.pdf |accessdate=11 February 2018}}</ref> and an anti-aircraft unit, the [[60th Coast Artillery (United States)|60th CA (AA)]]. The latter was posted on the higher elevations of Corregidor and was able to respond successfully to the Japanese air attacks, downing many fighters and bombers. The older stationary batteries with fixed mortars and immense cannons, for defense from attack by sea, were easily put out of commission by Japanese bombers. The American soldiers and Filipino Scouts defended the small fortress until they had little left to wage a defense.\n\nEarly in 1942, the Japanese air command installed oxygen in its bombers to fly higher than the range of the Corregidor anti-aircraft batteries, and after that time, heavier bombardment began.\n\nIn December 1941, Philippines President Manuel L. Quezon, General MacArthur, other high-ranking military officers and diplomats and families escaped the bombardment of Manila and were housed in Corregidor's [[Malinta Tunnel]]. Prior to their arrival, Malinta's laterals had served as high command headquarters, hospital and storage of food and arms. In March 1942, several U.S. Navy submarines arrived on the north side of Corregidor. The Navy brought in mail, orders, and weaponry. They took away with them the high American and Filipino government officers, gold and silver and other important records. Those who were unable to escape by submarine were eventually military [[POW]]s of Japan or placed in civilian [[concentration camps]] in Manila and other locations.\n\n[[File:Captured Japanese photograph. U.S. soldiers and sailors surrendering to Japanese forces at Corregidor, Philippine... - NARA - 531354.tif|thumb|U.S. and Filipino soldiers and sailors surrendering to Japanese forces at Corregidor]]\nCorregidor was defended by 11,000 personnel, comprising the units mentioned above that were stationed on Corregidor, the [[U.S. 4th Marine Regiment]], and U.S. Navy personnel deployed as infantry. Some were able to get to Corregidor from the Bataan Peninsula when the Japanese overwhelmed the units there. The Japanese began their final assault on Corregidor with an artillery barrage on 1 May. On the night of 5\u20136 May, two battalions of the Japanese 61st Infantry Regiment landed at the northeast end of the island. Despite strong resistance, the Japanese established a beachhead that was soon reinforced by tanks and artillery. The defenders were quickly pushed back toward the stronghold of Malinta Hill.\n\nLate on 6 May, Wainwright asked Homma for terms of surrender. Homma insisted that surrender include all Allied forces in the Philippines. Believing that the lives of all those on Corregidor would be endangered, Wainwright accepted. On 8 May, he sent a message to Sharp, ordering him to surrender the Visayan-Mindanao Force. Sharp complied, but many individuals carried on the fight as [[guerilla warfare|guerrillas]]. Few unit commanders were so hard pressed as to be forced to surrender and none had any desire to surrender. Sharp's decision to surrender involved many factors. Major Larry S. Schmidt, in a 1982 master's degree thesis, said Sharp's decision was based on two reasons: that the Japanese were capable of executing the 10,000 survivors of Corregidor, and that Sharp now knew his forces would not be reinforced by the United States, as had been previously thought.<ref>{{cite thesis|first = Larry S.|last = Schmidt|title = American Involvement in the Filipino Resistance Movement on Mindanao During the Japanese Occupation, 1942-1945|type=MMAS |publisher= U.S. Army Command and General Staff College|location = Fort Leavenworth, Kans.|page = 68|url = https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/b068659.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{See also|Japanese war crimes}}\n[[File:March of Death - Resting 03.jpg|thumb|Group of American prisoners, May 1942]]\nThe defeat was the beginning of three and a half years of harsh treatment for the Allied survivors, including atrocities like the [[Bataan Death March]] and the misery of Japanese prison camps, and the \"[[Hell Ships]]\" on which American and Allied men were sent to Japan to be used as labor in mines and factories.

It was ordered to prepare for war in the event that negotiations with the United States did not succeed in peacefully meeting Japanese objectives. Under Terauchi's command were four corps-equivalent armies, comprising ten divisions and three combined arms brigades, including the [[Japanese Fourteenth Area Army]]. Operations against the Philippines and Malaya were to be conducted simultaneously when Imperial General Headquarters ordered.\n\nThe invasion of the Philippines had three objectives:\n* To prevent the use of the Philippines as an advance base of operations by American forces\n* To acquire staging areas and supply bases to enhance operations against the Netherlands East Indies\n* To secure the lines of communication between occupied areas in the south and the Japanese Home Islands.\n\n====Invasion forces====\n[[File:Advance Japanese Landings Dec 1941.jpg|thumb|300 px|Advance Japanese landings in the Philippines 8\u201320 December 1941]]\nTerauchi assigned the Philippines invasion to the 14th Army, under the command of Lieutenant General [[Masaharu Homma]].<ref name=Chun>Chun, C., 2012, The Fall of the Philippines, 1941-1942, Oxford: Osprey Publishing, {{ISBN|978-1-84908-609-7}}</ref>{{rp|14,20}} Air support of ground operations was provided by the 5th Air Group, under Lieutenant General [[Hideyoshi Obata]],<ref name=Chun/>{{rp|21}} which was transferred to Formosa from Manchuria.

Gen. [[George M. Parker (general)|George M. Parker Jr.]], controlled a zone east and south of [[Manila]]. Parker had the PA [[41st Division (Philippines)|41st]] and [[51st Infantry Division (United States)|51st Infantry Division]]s and the 2nd Provisional Artillery Group of two batteries of the US 86th [[Field Artillery]] [[Regiment]] (PS).\n\nThe ''[[Visayan\u2013Mindanao Force]]'' under Brig. Gen. [[William F. Sharp]] comprised the PA [[61st Division (Philippines)|61st]], [[81st Division (Philippines)|81st]], and [[101st Division (Philippines)|101st Infantry Divisions]], reinforced after the start of the war by the newly inducted 73rd and 93rd Infantry Regiments. The 61st Division was located on [[Panay]], the 81st on [[Cebu]] and [[Negros Island|Negros]], and the 101st on [[Mindanao]]. In January a fourth division, the [[102nd Division (Philippines)|102nd]], was created on Mindanao from the field artillery regiments of the 61st and 81st Divisions acting as infantry (they had no artillery pieces), and the 103rd Infantry of the 101st Division. The 2nd Infantry of the Philippine Army's 1st Regular Division and the 2nd Battalion of the [[43d Infantry Regiment (United States)|U.S. 43rd Infantry (Philippine Scouts)]] were also made a part of the Mindanao Force.\n\nUSAFFE's ''Reserve Force'', under MacArthur's direct control, was composed of the Philippine Division, the [[91st Division (Philippines)|91st Division]] (PA), and headquarters units from the PA and Philippine Department, positioned just north of Manila. The 192nd and 194th Tank Battalions formed the separate Provisional Tank Group, also under MacArthur's direct command, at [[Clark Field]]/[[Fort Stotsenburg]], where they were positioned as a mobile defense against any attempt by airborne units to seize the field.\n\nFour U.S. [[United States Army Coast Artillery Corps|Coast Artillery Corps]] regiments guarded the entrance to [[Manila Bay]], including [[Corregidor Island]]. Across a narrow 3&nbsp;kilometre (2&nbsp;mi) strait of water from Bataan on Corregidor was [[Fort Mills]], defended by batteries of the 59th and 60th Coast Artillery Regiments (the latter an anti-aircraft unit), and the 91st and 92nd Coast Artillery Regiments (Philippine Scouts) of the [[Harbor Defenses of Manila and Subic Bays]]. The 59th CA acted as a supervisory unit for the batteries of all units positioned on [[Fort Hughes|Forts Hughes]], [[Fort Drum (El Fraile Island)|Drum]], [[Fort Frank|Frank]], and [[Fort Wint|Wint]]. The majority of the forts had been built circa 1910-1915 and, except for Fort Drum and Battery Monja on Corregidor, were unprotected against air and high-angle artillery attack except by camouflage.<ref>Shelby Stanton (1984).

Gen. [[Lewis H. Brereton]]. Previously the Philippine Department Air Force and Air Force USAFFE, the air force was activated on 16 November 1941 and was the largest USAAF combat air organization outside the United States. Its primary combat power in December 1941 consisted of 91 serviceable [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Warhawk]] fighters and 34 [[B-17 Flying Fortress]] bombers, with further modern aircraft en route. Tactically the FEAF was part of the Reserve Force, so that it fell under MacArthur's direct command.\n\nAs of 30 November 1941, the strength of US Army Troops in the Philippines, including Philippine units, was 31,095, consisting of 2,504 officers and\n28,591 enlisted (16,643 Americans and 11,957 Philippine Scouts).<ref>[http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/5-2/5-2_3.htm#p49 STRENGTH AND COMPOSITION OF U.S. ARMY TROOPS IN PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, 30 NOVEMBER 1941]</ref>\n\n====Mobilization====\nMacArthur's mobilization plans called for induction of the ten reserve divisions between 1 September and 15 December 1941. The timetable was met on 1 September with the induction of one regiment per division, but slowed as a lack of facilities and equipment hampered training. The second regiments of the divisions were not called up until 1 November, and the third regiments were not organized until after hostilities began. Training was also seriously inhibited by language difficulties between the American cadres and the Filipino troops, and by the many differing dialects (estimated at 70) of the numerous ethnic groups comprising the army. By the outbreak of war, only two-thirds of the army had been mobilized, but additions to the force continued with the induction of the Constabulary and a portion of the regular army, until a force of approximately 130,000 men was reached.\n\nThe most crucial equipment shortfalls were in rifles and divisional light artillery. MacArthur requested 84,500 [[M1 Garand]] rifles to replace the World War I [[M1917 Enfield]]s equipping the PA, of which there were adequate numbers, but the War Department denied the request because of production difficulties. The divisions had only 20% of their artillery requirements, and while plans had been approved to significantly reduce this gap, the arrangements came too late to be implemented before war isolated the Philippines.<ref>[http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/5-2/5-2_3.htm#p32 ''The Fall of the Philippines''], p. 35-36.</ref>\n\nBy contrast, the Philippine Division was adequately manned, equipped, and trained. MacArthur received immediate approval to modernize it by reorganizing it as a mobile \"triangular\" division. Increasing the authorized size of the Philippine Scouts was not politically viable (because of resentments within the less-well-paid Philippine Army), so MacArthur's plan also provided for freeing up Philippine Scouts to round out other units. The transfer of the American [[34th Infantry Regiment (United States)|34th Infantry]] from the [[8th Infantry Division (United States)|8th Infantry Division]] in the United States to the Philippine Division, accompanied by two field artillery battalions to create a pair of complete [[regimental combat team]]s, was actually underway when war broke out. The deployment ended with the troops still in the United States, where they were sent to defend Hawaii instead.\n\n====Other defense forces====\nThe [[United States Asiatic Fleet]] and [[United States Naval Districts|16th Naval District]], based at Manila, provided the naval defenses for the Philippines. Commanded by Admiral [[Thomas C. Hart]], the surface combatants of the Asiatic Fleet were the heavy cruiser {{USS|Houston|CA-30|6}}, the light cruiser {{USS|Marblehead|CL-12|6}}, and 13 [[Clemson-class destroyer|World War I-era destroyers]].<ref>[http://www.asiaticfleet.com/orbat.htm United States Asiatic Fleet], complete Order of Battle including patrol craft of 16th Naval District.</ref> Its primary striking power lay in the 23 modern submarines assigned to the Asiatic Fleet. Submarine Squadron (SUBRON) Two consisted of 6 [[Salmon class submarine]]s, and SUBRON Five of 11 [[United States Porpoise class submarine|Porpoise]] and [[Sargo class submarine]]s. In September 1941, naval patrol forces in the Philippines were augmented by the arrival of the six [[PT boat]]s of [[Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three]]. Likewise, the China [[Yangtze Patrol]] gunboats also became part of the Philippine naval defenses: {{USS|Asheville|PG-21|6}} (sunk south of Java 3 March 1942), {{USS|Mindanao|PR-8|6}} (lost 2 May 1942), {{USS|Luzon|PG-47|6}} (scuttled 6 May 1942 but salvaged by the Japanese), {{USS|Oahu|PR-6|6}} (sunk 5 May 1942), and {{USS|Quail|AM-15|6}} (scuttled 5 May 1942). In December 1941, the naval forces were augmented by the schooner {{USS|Lanikai|1914|6}}.\n\nThe U.S. [[4th Marine Regiment]], stationed in Shanghai, China, since the late 1920s, had anticipated a withdrawal from China during the summer of 1941. As personnel were routinely transferred back to the United States or separated from the service, the regimental commander, Col. [[Samuel L. Howard]], arranged unofficially for all replacements to be placed in the 1st Special Defense Battalion, based at [[Cavite]]. When the 4th Marines arrived in the Philippines on 30 November 1941, it incorporated the Marines at Cavite and [[Olongapo Naval Station]]s into its understrength ranks.<ref>[http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/5-2/5-2_29.htm#p527 ''The Fall of the Philippines''], p. 528-529. The [[Beijing|Peking]] and [[Chinwangtao]] detachments of the 4th were stranded in China by the onset of war. The 4th Marines had only two battalions, each organized into a machine gun company and two rifle companies of only two platoons each. The amalgamation of the 1st Special Defense Battalion, Cavite, enabled the 4th to organize a third battalion, and Marines of the Marine Barracks Olangapo enabled the 1st and 2nd Battalions to field three rifle companies of three platoons each.</ref> An initial plan to divide the 4th into two regiments, mixing each with a battalion of Philippine Constabulary, was discarded after Howard showed reluctance, and the 4th was stationed on [[Corregidor]] to augment the defenses there, with details detached to Bataan to protect USAFFE headquarters.\n\nAdditionally the U.S. [[Coast and Geodetic Survey]], a paramilitary survey force, operated in [[Manila]] with the ship [[USC&GSS Pathfinder (1899\u20131941)|USC&GSS ''Research'']].<ref Name=Pt5>{{cite web |url=http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/web/about_ngs/history/WWII-HISTORY-DOC-5-CGS.pdf |title=World War II History of the Department Of Commerce-Part 5 U.S. Coast And Geodetic Survey |author=Coast And Geodetic Survey |year=1951 |website= |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |accessdate=27 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Far East Air Force controversy==\nNews reached the Philippines that an [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] was in progress at 2:20&nbsp;am local time on 8 December 1941.<ref name=Couttie2009p101>{{cite book |title=\"Chew the Bones: Maddog Essays on Philippine History |chapter=17.

FEAF launched three squadron-sized fighter patrols and all of its serviceable bombers on Luzon between 08:00 and 08:30&nbsp;am as a precautionary move.<ref name=\"wde\">{{cite book |last=Edmunds |first=Walter D. |authorlink= |year=1992 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=SX0OOdZEZTIC&pg=PA57&lpg=PA57&dq=Arnold+%22Brereton%22#v=onepage&q=Arnold%20%22Brereton%22&f=false |title=They Fought With What They Had |work= |accessdate=28 January 2011 |isbn=9781428915411}}, p. 77.</ref> After MacArthur gave Brereton the authorization he sought at 10:15&nbsp;am, the bombers were ordered to land and prepare for the afternoon raid on Formosa. All three pursuit squadrons began to run short on fuel and broke off their patrols at the same time.\n\nThe 20th Pursuit Squadron's [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|Curtiss P-40B]] interceptors patrolled the area while the bombers landed at [[Clark Air Base|Clark Field]] between 10:30 and 10:45, then dispersed to their revetments for servicing.<ref name=\"lmcf\"/> The 17th Pursuit Squadron, based at [[Nichols Field]], also landed at Clark and had its aircraft refueled while its pilots ate lunch, then put its pilots on alert shortly after 11:00.<ref>Edmunds, p. 83.</ref> All but two of the Clark Field B-17s were on the ground.<ref>Edmunds, p. 84. One was on a reconnaissance mission to Formosa, the other over eastern Luzon after taking off as the others were landing. A third B-17 was in the air en route from Mindanao for repair of a wing fuel tank.</ref>\n\nAt 11:27&nbsp;am and 11:29&nbsp;am, the radar post at Iba Field detected two incoming raids while the closest was still 130 miles out. It alerted FEAF headquarters and the command post at Clark Field, a warning that reached only the pursuit group commander, Major Orrin L. Grover, who apparently became confused by multiple and conflicting reports.<ref name=\"lmcf\"/><ref name=\"Correll, Caught on the Ground\" /> The 3rd Pursuit Squadron took off from Iba at 11:45 with instructions to intercept the western force, which was thought to have Manila as its target, but dust problems during its takeoff resulted in the fragmentation of its flights. Two flights of the 21st Pursuit Squadron (PS) at Nichols Field, six P-40Es, took off at 11:45, led by 1st Lt. [[William Dyess]]. They started for Clark but were diverted to Manila Bay as a second line of defense if the 3rd PS failed to intercept its force. The 21st's third flight, taking off five minutes later, headed toward Clark, although engine problems with its brand-new P-40Es reduced its numbers by two. The 17th Pursuit Squadron took off at 12:15&nbsp;pm from Clark, ordered to patrol Bataan and Manila Bay, while the 34th PS at Del Carmen never received its orders to protect Clark Field and did not launch.<ref>Edmunds, pp. 84\u201385.</ref> The 20th PS, dispersed at Clark, was ready to take off but did not receive orders from group headquarters. Instead a line chief saw the incoming formation of Japanese bombers and the section commander, 1st Lt. [[Joseph Harold Moore|Joseph H. Moore]],<ref>[http://www.af.mil/About-Us/Biographies/Display/Article/106184/lieutenant-general-joseph-h-moore/ US Air Force biography of LTG Joseph H. Moore]</ref> ordered the scramble himself.\n\nEven though tracked by radar and with three U.S. pursuit squadrons in the air, when Japanese bombers of the 11th K\u014dk\u016bkantai attacked Clark Field at 12:40&nbsp;pm,<ref>Edmunds, p. 102. Edmunds interviewed numerous officers present when the attack began.</ref> they achieved tactical surprise. Two squadrons of [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17s]] were dispersed on the ground. Most of the P-40s of the 20th PS were preparing to taxi and were struck by the first wave of 27 Japanese twin-engine [[Mitsubishi G3M]] \"Nell\" bombers; only four of the 20th PS P-40Bs managed to take off as the bombs were falling.\n\nA second bomber attack (26 [[Mitsubishi G4M]] \"Betty\" bombers) followed closely, then escorting Zero fighters strafed the field for 30 minutes, destroying 12 of the 17 American heavy bombers present and seriously damaging three others. Two damaged B-17s were made flyable and taken to Mindanao, where one was destroyed in a ground collision.<ref>Correll, ''Caught on the Ground''.</ref>\n\nA near-simultaneous attack on the auxiliary field at Iba to the northwest by 54 \"Betty\" bombers was also successful: all but four of the 3rd Pursuit Squadron's P-40s, short on fuel and caught in their landing pattern, were destroyed in combat or by lack of fuel.<ref>Edmunds, pp. 95\u201397. Four of the 18 airborne P-40s made Rosario airfield, while a fifth took off from Iba and found refuge there also.</ref> Twelve P-40s from the 20th (four), 21st (two), and 3rd (six) Squadrons attacked the strafers but with little success, losing at least four of their own.\n\nThe Far East Air Force lost half its planes in the 45-minute attack, and was all but destroyed over the next few days, including a number of the surviving B-17s lost to takeoff crashes of other planes.<ref name=\"lmcf\"/> The 24th Pursuit Group flew its last interception on 10 December, losing 11 of the 40 or so P-40s it sent up, and the surviving P-35s of the 34th PS were destroyed on the ground at Del Carmen.<ref>Edmunds, pp. 133\u2013136.</ref> That night FEAF combat strength had been reduced to 12 operable B-17s, 22 P-40s, and 8 P-35s.<ref>Edmunds, p. 138.</ref> Fighter strength fluctuated daily until 24 December, when USAFFE ordered all its forces into Bataan. Until then P-40s and P-35s were cobbled together from spare parts taken from wrecked airplanes, and still crated P-40Es were assembled at the Philippine Air Depot. Clark Field was abandoned as a bomber field on 11 December after being used as a staging base for a handful of B-17 missions.<ref>Edmunds, p. 133.</ref> Between 17 and 20 December, the 14 surviving B-17s were withdrawn to Australia. Every other aircraft of the FEAF was destroyed or captured.<ref>Edmunds, p. 178.</ref>\n\nNo formal investigation took place regarding this failure as occurred in the aftermath of Pearl Harbor. After the war, Brereton and Sutherland in effect blamed each other for FEAF being surprised on the ground, and MacArthur released a statement that he had no knowledge of any recommendation to attack Formosa with B-17s.<ref name=\"lmcf\"/> Walter D. Edmunds summarized the disaster: \"in the Philippines the personnel of our armed forces almost without exception failed to assess accurately the weight, speed, and efficiency of the Japanese Air Force.\" He quoted Maj. Gen. [[Emmett O'Donnell Jr.]], then a major in charge of the B-17s sent to Mindanao, as concluding that the first day was a \"disorganized business\" and that no one was \"really at fault\" because no one was \"geared for war.\"<ref>Edmunds, p. 93.</ref>\n\n==Invasion==\n\n===Initial landings===\n[[File:Invasion of the Philippines, 1941.jpg|thumb|300px|A map of Luzon Island showing Japanese landings and advances from 8 December 1941 to 8 January 1942]]\nThe 14th Army began its invasion with a landing on [[Japanese Invasion of Batan Island|Batan Island]] (not to be confused with Bataan Peninsula), {{convert|120|mi|km}} off the north coast of Luzon, on 8 December 1941, by selected naval infantry units. Landings on [[Camiguin de Babuyanes|Camiguin Island]] and at [[Japanese Invasion of Vigan|Vigan]], [[Aparri, Cagayan|Aparri]], and [[Gonzaga, Cagayan|Gonzaga]] in northern Luzon followed two days later.\n\nTwo B-17s attacked the Japanese ships offloading at Gonzaga. Other B-17s with fighter escort attacked the landings at Vigan. In this last coordinated action of the Far East Air Force, U.S. planes damaged two Japanese transports (''[[Japanese transport Oigawa Maru|Oigawa Maru]]'' and ''[[SS Takao Maru (1927)|Takao Maru]]''), the [[cruiser]] {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Naka||2}}, and the [[destroyer]] {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Murasame|1935|2}}, and sank [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]] ''[[Japanese minesweeper No. 10 (1938)|W-10]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.combinedfleet.com/naka_t.htm |title=HIJMS NAKA: Tabular Record of Movement |author=Bob Hackett and Sander Kingsepp |year=2007 |accessdate=26 September 2007}}</ref>\n\nEarly on the morning of 12 December, the Japanese landed 2,500 men of the 16th Division at [[Legazpi, Albay|Legazpi]] on southern Luzon, {{convert|150|mi|km}} from the nearest American and Philippine forces. The attack on Mindanao followed on 19 December, using elements of the 16th Army temporarily attached to the invasion force to permit the 14th Army to use all its troops on Luzon.\n\nMeanwhile, Admiral [[Thomas C. Hart]] withdrew most of his [[U.S. Asiatic Fleet]] from Philippine waters following Japanese air strikes that inflicted heavy damage on U.S. naval facilities at [[Cavite Navy Yard|Cavite]] on 10 December. Only submarines were left to contest Japanese naval superiority, and the commanders of these, conditioned by prewar doctrine that held the fleet submarine to be a scouting vessel more vulnerable to air and anti-submarine attack than it actually was, proved unequal to the task.\n\nIn a book ''A Different Kind of Victory: A Biography of Admiral Thomas C. Hart'' ([[Naval Institute Press]], 1981), James Leutze wrote:\n\n\"He had 27 subs submerged in [[Manila Bay]],...<ref>Leutze (1981), pages 235</ref> it was Washington, not the Asiatic Fleet Commander that directed the fleet to withdraw from Manila.<ref>Leutze (1981), pages 230</ref>... Hart was directed by Washington to send US Navy surface forces and submarines southeast toward Australia.<ref>Leutze (1981), pages 237</ref>... Douglas MacArthur and [[Henry Stimson]] ([[United States Secretary of War]]) feuding with Admiral Hart over lack of US Navy submarine action. MacArthur asked Admiral Hart: \"What in the world is the matter with your submarines?\".<ref>Leutze (1981), pages 242</ref>.. MacArthur complained that Hart's inactivity allowed Japan's navy freedom of action.<ref>Leutze (1981), pages 234</ref>... According to Stimson, MacArthur felt that Hart's ships and submarines were ineffectual, but because Admiral Hart had lost his courage. Admiral Hart's reaction to MacArthur's brickbats: \"He (MacArthur) is inclined to cut my throat and perhaps the Navy in general.\"<ref>Leutze (1981), pages 240</ref>\"\n\n===Main attack===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\n[[File:Withdrawal South Dec 1941.jpg|thumb|300 px|Withdrawal in the South, 25\u201331 December 1941]]\nThe main attack began early on the morning of 22 December as 43,110 men of the 48th Division and one regiment of the 16th Division, supported by artillery and approximately 90 tanks, landed at three points along the east coast of [[Lingayen Gulf]]. A few B-17s flying from Australia attacked the invasion fleet, and U.S. submarines harassed it from the adjacent waters, but to little effect.\n\nGeneral Wainwright's poorly trained and equipped [[11th Division (Philippines)|11th Division (PA)]] and [[71st Division (Philippines)|71st Division (PA)]] could neither repel the landings nor pin the enemy on the beaches. The remaining Japanese units of the divisions landed farther south along the gulf. The [[26th Cavalry Regiment (Philippine_Scouts)|26th Cavalry (PS)]] of the well-trained and better-equipped [[Philippine Scouts]], advancing to meet them, put up a strong fight at [[Rosario, La Union|Rosario]], but was forced to withdraw after taking heavy casualties with no hope of sufficient reinforcements. By nightfall, 23 December, the Japanese had moved ten miles (16&nbsp;km) into the interior.\n\nThe next day, 7,000 men of the 16th Division hit the beaches at three locations along the shore of [[Lamon Bay]] in southern Luzon, where they found General Parker's forces dispersed, and without artillery protecting the eastern coast, unable to offer serious resistance. They immediately consolidated their positions and began the drive north toward Manila where they would link up with the forces advancing south toward the capital for the final victory.\n\n===Withdrawal into Bataan===\nThe U.S. Philippine Division moved into the field in reaction to reports of airborne drops near Clark Field, and when this proved false, were deployed to cover the withdrawal of troops into Bataan and to resist Japanese advances in the [[Subic Bay]] area.\n\nOn 24 December, MacArthur invoked the prewar plan WPO-3 (War Plan Orange 3), which called for use of five delaying positions in central Luzon while forces withdrew into Bataan. This was carried out in part by the [[26th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|26th Cavalry Regiment]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Merriam |first=Ray |year=1999 |title=War in the Philippines |publisher=Merriam Press |pages=70\u201382 |isbn=1-57638-164-1 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=utbD8wwF91kC |page=70}}\n| accessdate =31 January 2008\n}}</ref> He relieved General Parker of his command of South Luzon Force and had him begin preparing defensive positions on Bataan, using units as they arrived; both the military headquarters and the Philippines government were moved there. Nine days of feverish movement of supplies into Bataan, primarily by barge from Manila, began in an attempt to feed an anticipated force of 43,000 troops for six months. (Ultimately 80,000 troops and 26,000 refugees flooded Bataan.) Nevertheless, substantial forces remained in other areas for several months.\n\n[[File:Macarthur&wainwright.jpg|thumb|200px|Generals Wainwright (left) and MacArthur]]\nUnits of both defense forces were maneuvered to hold open the escape routes into Bataan, in particular [[City of San Fernando, Pampanga|San Fernando]], the steel bridges at [[Calumpit, Bulacan|Calumpit]] over the deep [[Pampanga River]] at the north end of Manila Bay, and [[Plaridel, Bulacan|Plaridel]] north of Manila. The South Luzon Force, despite its inexperience and equivocating orders to withdraw and hold, successfully executed \"leapfrogging\" retrograde techniques and crossed the bridges by 1 January. Japanese air commanders rejected appeals by the 48th Division to bomb the bridges to trap the retreating forces,<ref>[http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/5-2/5-2_12.htm#p205 ''The Fall of the Philippines''], p. 208.</ref> which were subsequently demolished by Philippine Scout engineers on 1 January.\n\nThe Japanese realized the full extent of MacArthur's plan on 30 December and ordered the 48th Division to press forward and seal off Bataan. In a series of actions between 2 and 4 January, the 11th and 21st Divisions of the Philippine Army, the 26th Cavalry (PS) and the American [[M3 Stuart]] tanks of the Provisional Tank Group held open the road from San Fernando to [[Dinalupihan]] at the neck of the peninsula for the retreating forces of the South Luzon Force, then made good their own escape. Despite 50% losses in the 194th Tank Battalion during the retreat, the Stuarts and a supporting battery of [[M3 GMC|75mm SPM halftracks]] repeatedly stopped Japanese thrusts and were the final units to enter Bataan.\n\nOn 30 December, the [[31st Infantry Regiment (United States)|American 31st Infantry]] moved to the vicinity of [[Dalton Pass]] to cover the flanks of troops withdrawing from central and southern Luzon, while other units of the Philippine Division organized positions at Bataan. The 31st Infantry then moved to a defensive position on the west side of the [[Olongapo City|Olongapo]]-Manila road, near [[Layac Junction]]\u2014at the neck of Bataan Peninsula\u2014on 5 January 1942. The junction was given up on 6 January, but the withdrawal to Bataan was successful.\n\n==Battle of Bataan==\n{{Main|Battle of Bataan}}\n[[File:Situation on Bataan 8 Jan 1942.jpg|thumb|300 px|Situation on Bataan, 8 January 1942]]\nFrom 7 to 14 January 1942, the Japanese concentrated on reconnaissance and preparations for an attack on the Main Battle Line from [[Abucay, Bataan|Abucay]] to [[Mount Natib]] to Mauban. At the same time, in a critical mistake, they also relieved the 48th Division, responsible for much of the success of Japanese operations, with the much less-capable 65th Brigade, intended as a garrison force. The Japanese 5th Air group was withdrawn from operations on 5 January in preparation for movement with the 48th Division to the [[Netherlands East Indies]].<ref>[http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/MacArthur%20Reports/MacArthur%20V2%20P1/ch6.htm#p103 Japanese Operations in the Southwest Pacific Area], p.104.</ref> U.S. and Filipino forces repelled night attacks near Abucay, and elements of the U.S. Philippine Division counterattacked on 16 January. This failed, and the division withdrew to the Reserve Battle Line from [[Pilar, Bataan|Casa Pilar]] to [[Bagac, Bataan|Bagac]] in the center of the peninsula on 26 January.\n\nThe 14th Army renewed its attacks on 23 January with an attempted amphibious landing behind the lines by a battalion of the 16th Division, then with general attacks beginning 27 January along the battle line. The amphibious landing was disrupted by a [[PT boat]] and contained in brutally dense jungle by ad hoc units made up of U.S. Army Air Corps troops, naval personnel, and Philippine Constabulary. The pocket was then slowly forced back to the cliffs, with high casualties on both sides. Landings to reinforce the surviving pocket on 26 January and 2 February were severely disrupted by air attacks from the few remaining FEAF P-40s, then trapped and eventually annihilated on 13 February.\n\nA penetration in the I Corps line was stopped and broken up into several pockets. General Homma on 8 February ordered the suspension of offensive operations in order to reorganize his forces. This could not be carried out immediately, because the 16th Division remained engaged trying to extricate a pocketed battalion of its 20th Infantry. With further losses, the remnants of the battalion, 378 officers and men, were extricated on 15 February. On 22 February, the 14th Army line withdrew a few miles to the north and USAFFE forces re-occupied the abandoned positions. The result of the \"Battle of the Points\" and \"Battle of the Pockets\" was total destruction of all three battalions of the Japanese 20th Infantry and a clear USAFFE victory.\n\n[[File:Hayward, California. As Bataan fell, as recorded in these newspapers of April 9, 1942, evacuation o . . . - NARA - 536016.jpg|thumb|California newspapers, 9 April 1942]]\nFor several weeks, the Japanese, deterred by heavy losses and reduced to a single brigade, conducted siege operations while waiting refitting and reinforcement. Both armies engaged in patrols and limited local attacks. Because of the worsening Allied position in the Asia-Pacific region, U.S. President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin D. Roosevelt]] ordered MacArthur to [[Douglas MacArthur's escape from the Philippines|relocate to Australia]], as Supreme Allied Commander [[South West Pacific Area]]. (MacArthur's famous speech regarding the Philippines, in which he said \"I came out of Bataan and I shall return\" was made at [[Terowie, South Australia|Terowie]]\n, [[South Australia]] on 20 March.) Wainwright officially assumed control of what was now termed United States Forces in the Philippines (USFIP) on 23 March. During this period, elements of the U.S. Philippine Division were shifted to assist in the defense of other sectors.\n\nBeginning 28 March, a new wave of Japanese air and artillery attacks hit Allied forces who were severely weakened by malnutrition, sickness and prolonged fighting. On 3 April, the Japanese began to break through along [[Mount Samat]], estimating that the offensive would require a month to end the campaign. The U.S. Philippine Division, no longer operating as a coordinated unit and exhausted by five days of nearly continuous combat, was unable to counterattack effectively against heavy Japanese assaults. On 8 April, the U.S. 57th Infantry Regiment (PS) and the 31st Division PA were overrun near the [[Alangan River]]. The U.S. 45th Infantry Regiment (PS), under orders to reach Mariveles and evacuate to Corregidor, finally surrendered on 10 April 1942. Only 300 men of the U.S. 31st Infantry successfully reached Corregidor.\n\n==Battle of Corregidor==\n{{Main|Battle of Corregidor}}\n[[File:Japanese bombers over Corregidor.jpg|thumb|[[Mitsubishi Ki-21|Japanese bombers]] over Corregidor]]\n[[File:Map of Corregidor 1941.jpg|thumb|left|300 px|Map of Corregidor island in 1941]]\nCorregidor was a U.S. Army Coast Artillery position defending the entrance to Manila Bay. It was armed by both older seacoast [[disappearing gun]] batteries of the [[59th Coast Artillery (United States)|59th]] and [[91st Coast Artillery (United States)|91st Coast Artillery]] Regiments (the latter a Philippine Scouts unit), an offshore mine field of approximately 35 groups of [[controlled mines]],<ref name=CAJHarris1>{{cite journal |last1=Bocksel |first1=Arnold A. |year=1946 |title=The USAMP ''General George Harrison'' in the Harbor Defenses of Manila and Subic Bay |journal=Coast Artillery Journal |volume=LXXXIX |issue=NOVEMBER-DECEMBER 1946 |pages=54 |publisher=United States Coast Artillery Association |url=http://sill-www.army.mil/ada-online/coast-artillery-journal/_docs/1946/11-12/Nov-Dec%201946.pdf |accessdate=11 February 2018}}</ref> and an anti-aircraft unit, the [[60th Coast Artillery (United States)|60th CA (AA)]]. The latter was posted on the higher elevations of Corregidor and was able to respond successfully to the Japanese air attacks, downing many fighters and bombers. The older stationary batteries with fixed mortars and immense cannons, for defense from attack by sea, were easily put out of commission by Japanese bombers. The American soldiers and Filipino Scouts defended the small fortress until they had little left to wage a defense.\n\nEarly in 1942, the Japanese air command installed oxygen in its bombers to fly higher than the range of the Corregidor anti-aircraft batteries, and after that time, heavier bombardment began.\n\nIn December 1941, Philippines President Manuel L. Quezon, General MacArthur, other high-ranking military officers and diplomats and families escaped the bombardment of Manila and were housed in Corregidor's [[Malinta Tunnel]]. Prior to their arrival, Malinta's laterals had served as high command headquarters, hospital and storage of food and arms. In March 1942, several U.S. Navy submarines arrived on the north side of Corregidor. The Navy brought in mail, orders, and weaponry. They took away with them the high American and Filipino government officers, gold and silver and other important records. Those who were unable to escape by submarine were eventually military [[POW]]s of Japan or placed in civilian [[concentration camps]] in Manila and other locations.\n\n[[File:Captured Japanese photograph. U.S. soldiers and sailors surrendering to Japanese forces at Corregidor, Philippine... - NARA - 531354.tif|thumb|U.S. and Filipino soldiers and sailors surrendering to Japanese forces at Corregidor]]\nCorregidor was defended by 11,000 personnel, comprising the units mentioned above that were stationed on Corregidor, the [[U.S. 4th Marine Regiment]], and U.S. Navy personnel deployed as infantry. Some were able to get to Corregidor from the Bataan Peninsula when the Japanese overwhelmed the units there. The Japanese began their final assault on Corregidor with an artillery barrage on 1 May. On the night of 5\u20136 May, two battalions of the Japanese 61st Infantry Regiment landed at the northeast end of the island. Despite strong resistance, the Japanese established a beachhead that was soon reinforced by tanks and artillery. The defenders were quickly pushed back toward the stronghold of Malinta Hill.\n\nLate on 6 May, Wainwright asked Homma for terms of surrender. Homma insisted that surrender include all Allied forces in the Philippines. Believing that the lives of all those on Corregidor would be endangered, Wainwright accepted. On 8 May, he sent a message to Sharp, ordering him to surrender the Visayan-Mindanao Force. Sharp complied, but many individuals carried on the fight as [[guerilla warfare|guerrillas]]. Few unit commanders were so hard pressed as to be forced to surrender and none had any desire to surrender. Sharp's decision to surrender involved many factors. Major Larry S. Schmidt, in a 1982 master's degree thesis, said Sharp's decision was based on two reasons: that the Japanese were capable of executing the 10,000 survivors of Corregidor, and that Sharp now knew his forces would not be reinforced by the United States, as had been previously thought.<ref>{{cite thesis|first = Larry S.|last = Schmidt|title = American Involvement in the Filipino Resistance Movement on Mindanao During the Japanese Occupation, 1942-1945|type=MMAS |publisher= U.S. Army Command and General Staff College|location = Fort Leavenworth, Kans.|page = 68|url = https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/b068659.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{See also|Japanese war crimes}}\n[[File:March of Death - Resting 03.jpg|thumb|Group of American prisoners, May 1942]]\nThe defeat was the beginning of three and a half years of harsh treatment for the Allied survivors, including atrocities like the [[Bataan Death March]] and the misery of Japanese prison camps, and the \"[[Hell Ships]]\" on which American and Allied men were sent to Japan to be used as labor in mines and factories.

The plan called for two of the first-stage engines to shut down to reduce the rocket's acceleration at approximately 2 minutes 30 seconds into the flight when the Falcon 9 would nominally be {{convert|90|km|mi}} high and traveling at 10 times the speed of sound. The remaining engines were planned to cut off shortly after\u2014an event known as main-engine cutoff (MECO). Five seconds after MECO, the first and second stages separate. Seven seconds later, the second stage's single Merlin vacuum engine was projected to ignite to begin a 6-minute, 14-second burn to put Dragon into [[low-Earth orbit]]. Forty seconds after second-stage ignition, Dragon's protective nose cone, which covers Dragon's berthing mechanism, was planned to be jettisoned. At the 9-minute, 14-second mark after launch, the second-stage engine was scheduled to cut off (SECO). Thirty-five seconds later, Dragon was planned to separate from Falcon 9's second stage and reach its preliminary orbit. The dragon would, per plan, then deploy its solar arrays and open its guidance and navigation control (GNC) bay door which holds the sensors necessary for rendezvous and Dragon's [[Power Data Grapple Fixture|grapple fixture]].<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\n=== Flight day 2 (9 October) ===\nThe mission plan called for the Dragon spacecraft to perform a coelliptic burn that would place it in a circular [[coelliptic orbit]].<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\n=== Flight day 3 (10 October) ===\nAs Dragon chased the [[International Space Station]], the spacecraft established UHF communication using its COTS Ultra-high-frequency Communication Unit (CUCU). Also, using the crew command panel (CCP) onboard the station, the expedition crew monitored the approach. This ability for the crew to send commands to Dragon is important during the rendezvous and departure phases of the mission.<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\nDuring the final approach to the station, a go/no-go was performed by [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center#FCR 1 (2006-present)|Mission Control Houston]] and the SpaceX team in Hawthorne to allow Dragon to perform another engine burn that brought it {{convert|250|m|ft}} from the station. At this distance, Dragon began using its close-range guidance systems, composed of [[LIDAR]] and thermal imagers. These systems confirmed that Dragon's position and velocity are accurate by comparing the LIDAR image that Dragon receives against Dragon's thermal imagers. The Dragon flight control team in Hawthorne, with assistance from the NASA flight control team at the Johnson Space Center's International Space Station Flight Control Room, commanded the spacecraft to approach the station from its hold position. After another go/no-go was performed by the Houston and Hawthorne teams, Dragon was permitted to enter the Keep-Out Sphere (KOS), an imaginary sphere drawn {{convert|200|m|ft}} around the station that reduces the risk of collision. Dragon proceeded to a position {{convert|30|m|ft}} from the station and was automatically held. Another go/no-go was completed. Then Dragon proceeded to the {{convert|10|m|ft}} position \u2014 the capture point. A final go/no-go was performed, and the Mission Control Houston team notified the crew they were going for the capture of Dragon.<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\nAt that point, Expedition 33 crewmember [[Akihiko Hoshide]] of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency used the station's {{convert|17.6|m|ft}} robotic arm, known as [[Mobile Servicing System#Canadarm2 |Canadarm2]], reached for and grappled the Dragon spacecraft at 10:56 UTC.<ref name=SPACENOW10/> Hoshide, with the help of Expedition 33 Commander [[Sunita Williams]] of NASA, guided Dragon to the Earth-facing side of the station's [[Harmony module]]. Williams and Hoshide swapped places and Williams gently berthed Dragon to Harmony's [[Common Berthing Mechanism]] at 13:03 UTC.<ref name=SPACENOW10/>\n\nThe opening of the hatch between Dragon and the Harmony module, which was originally not scheduled to occur until 11 October, was moved up and occurred at 17:40 UTC.<ref name=SPACENOW10/>\n\n=== Remainder of mission (11 to 28 October) ===\n[[File:SpX CRS-1 berthed - cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Dragon as seen from [[Cupola (ISS module)|Cupola]] on 14 October 2012]]\nOver a period of two and a half weeks, the ISS crew unloaded Dragon's payload and reloaded it with cargo for return to Earth.<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>{{Failed verification|date=November 2012}}<!-- a source from before the flight does not confirm that the planned event became a past-tense historical fact; needs a better source, or the prose needs to speak to the mission plan as outlined in the presskit -->\n\nAfter its mission at the orbital laboratory was completed, newly arrived Expedition 33 Flight Engineer [[Kevin A. Ford|Kevin Ford]] used the Canadarm2 robotic arm to detach Dragon from Harmony, maneuver it out to the 15-meter (50-foot) release point, and release the vehicle. Dragon then performed a series of three burns to place it on a trajectory away from the station. Approximately six hours after Dragon departed the station, it conducted a deorbit burn, which lasted up to 10 minutes. Dragon's trunk, which contains its solar arrays, was then jettisoned.<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>{{Failed verification|date=November 2012}}<!-- a source from before the flight does not confirm that the planned event became a past-tense historical fact; needs a better source, or the prose needs to speak to the mission plan as outlined in the presskit -->\n[[File:SpX-1 Dragon at port.1.jpg|thumb|left|The SpX-1 capsule seen back at port on 30 October 2012]]\nThe landing was controlled by automatic firing of its [[Draco (rocket engine family)#Draco|Draco]] thrusters during [[Atmospheric entry|reentry]].{{Failed verification|date=November 2012}}<!-- a source from before the flight does not confirm that the planned event became a past-tense historical fact; needs a better source, or the prose needs to speak to the mission plan as outlined in the presskit --> In a carefully timed sequence of events, dual [[drogue parachute]]s deploy at an altitude of {{convert|13700|m|ft|abbr=on}} to stabilize and slow the spacecraft. Full deployment of the drogues triggers the release of the three main parachutes, each 35 meters (116 feet) in diameter, at about {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. While the drogues detach from the spacecraft, the main parachutes further slow the spacecraft's descent to approximately {{convert|4.8|to|5.4|m/s|ft/s|sp=us}}. Even if Dragon were to lose one of its main parachutes, the two remaining chutes would still permit a safe landing. The Dragon capsule is expected to land in the Pacific Ocean, about {{convert|450|km|mi|abbr=on}} off the coast of southern California. SpaceX uses a 100-foot boat equipped with an A-frame and an articulating crane, a 90-foot crew boat for telemetry operations, and two 24-foot rigid-hull inflatable boats to perform recovery operations. On board are approximately a dozen SpaceX engineers and technicians as well as a four-person dive team. Once the Dragon capsule splashed down, the recovery team secured the vehicle and then placed it on deck for the journey back to shore.{{Failed verification|date=November 2012}}<!-- a source from before the flight does not confirm that the planned event became a past-tense historical fact; needs a better source, or the prose needs to speak to the mission plan as outlined in the presskit --><ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\nSpaceX technicians opened the side hatch of the vehicle and retrieved the time-critical items. The critical cargo items were placed on a fast-boat for the 450-Kilometer trip back to California for eventual return to NASA that then took care of the precious science cargo and handle post-flight analysis of the samples.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceflight101.com/dragon-crs-1-mission-updates.html |title=Dragon CRS-1 Mission Updates |publisher=SPACEFLIGHT101 |accessdate=8 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130212070813/http://www.spaceflight101.com/dragon-crs-1-mission-updates.html |archivedate=12 February 2013  }}</ref> The rest of the cargo was unloaded once the Dragon capsule reached SpaceX's test facility in McGregor, Texas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/004/121028splashdown/ |title=Dragon Mission Report &#124; Return of the Dragon: Commercial craft back home |publisher=Spaceflight Now |date= |accessdate=8 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Payload ==\n[[File:CRS SpX-1 Dragon int.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The Dragon spacecraft being integrated onto Falcon 9 on 30 September 2012]]\n\n=== Primary payload ===\nWhen launched the CRS-1 Dragon was filled with about {{convert|1995|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of cargo, {{convert|882|lb|kg|abbr=on}} without packaging.<ref name=Presskit/> Included was {{convert|260|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of crew supplies, {{convert|390|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of critical materials to support the 166 experiments on board the station and 66 new experiments, as well as {{convert|232|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of hardware for the station as well as other miscellaneous items.<ref name=Presskit/>\n\nThe Dragon returned {{convert|1995|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of cargo, {{convert|1673|lb|kg|abbr=on}} without packaging.<ref name=Presskit/> Included was {{convert|163|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of crew supplies, {{convert|866|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of scientific experiments and experiment hardware, {{convert|518|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of space station hardware, {{convert|68|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of [[spacesuit]] equipment and {{convert|55|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of miscellaneous items.<ref name=Presskit/>\n\n=== Secondary payload ===\nFor some months prior to the launch, a {{convert|150|kg|lb|abbr=on}} prototype second-generation [[Orbcomm (satellite)|Orbcomm satellite]] was planned to be launched as a [[secondary payload]] from Falcon 9's second stage.<ref name=\"Orbcomm 25 May 2012\" /><ref name=\"Hartman 23 July 2012\" />\n\nAlthough the secondary payload made it to the Dragon insertion orbit, an engine anomaly on one of the nine engines on the Falcon 9 first stage during the ascent resulted in automatic engine shutdown and a longer first-stage burn on the remaining eight engines to complete orbital insertion while subsequently increasing use of propellant over the nominal mission.\n\nThe primary payload contractor, NASA, requires a greater-than-99% estimated probability that the stage of any secondary payload on a similar orbital inclination to the [[International Space Station]] will reach their orbital altitude goal above the station.

During flight, the data suggests this material flaw ultimately developed into a breach in the main combustion chamber. This breach released a jet of hot gas and fuel in the direction of the main fuel line causing a secondary leak and ultimately a rapid drop in engine pressure. As a result, the flight computer commanded shutdown of engine 1 and Falcon 9 continued on its path to ensure Dragon's entry into orbit for subsequent rendezvous and berthing with the ISS.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aviationweek.com/blog/spacex-engine-anomaly-overview |title=SpaceX: Engine Anomaly Overview |publisher=Aviationweek.com |date= |accessdate=8 October 2013}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Spaceflight}}\n* [[List of Falcon 9 launches]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist |colwidth=30em |refs=\n\n<ref name=HARTMAN>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/672214main_1-Hartman_July12_NAC_Final_508.pdf |title=International Space Station Program Status |last=Hartman |first=Dan |date=23 July 2012 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Presskit\">\n{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/694166main_SpaceXCRS-1PressKit.pdf |title=SpX CRS-1 Mission Press Kit |date=4 October 2012 |publisher=NASA, SpaceX, 45th Space Wing |accessdate=6 October 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"SpaceX Launch Manifest\">\n{{cite web |title=SpaceX Launch Manifest |publisher=SpaceX |url=http://www.spacex.com/launch_manifest.php |accessdate=31 May 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"NASA Launch Schedule\">\n{{cite web |title=NASA's Consolidated Launch Schedule |publisher=NASA |url=http://www.nasa.gov/missions/highlights/schedule.html |accessdate=21 June 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"NASAsept20\">\n{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/spacex-crs1-target.html |title=SpaceX, NASA Target Oct. 7 Launch For Resupply Mission To Space Station |date=20 September 2012 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=26 September 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Clark 18 May 2012\">\n{{cite web |last=Clark |first=Stephen |date=18 May 2012 |title=SpaceX's historic commercial mission is 'just a test flight' |publisher=SpaceFlightNow |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/003/120518commercial/ |accessdate=25 August 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=ClarkOct28>{{cite web |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/004/121028splashdown/#.UI_fCIa_PKg |title=Return of the Dragon: Commercial craft back home |last=Clark |first=Stephen |date=28 October 2012 |publisher=SpaceFlightNow |accessdate=30 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Clark 24 August 2012\">\n{{cite web |title=NASA ready for operational cargo flights by SpaceX |last=Clark |first=Stephen |date=24 August 2012 |publisher=SpaceFlightNow |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1208/24cots/ |accessdate=25 August 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=SPACENOW10>{{cite web |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/004/121010arrival/ |title=Dragon arrives at station with commercial delivery |last=Clark |first=Stephen |date=10 October 2012 |publisher=SpaceFlightNow |accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Orbcomm 25 May 2012\">\n{{cite press |title=Orbcomm Eagerly Awaits Launch of New Satellite on Next Falcon 9 |date=25 May 2012 |publisher=Space News |url=http://www.spacenews.com/satellite_telecom/120525-spacex-success-welcome-orbcomm.html |accessdate=28 May 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Hartman 23 July 2012\">\n{{cite web |last=Hartman |first=Dan |date=23 July 2012 |title=International Space Station Program Status |publisher=NASA |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/672214main_1-Hartman_July12_NAC_Final_508.pdf |accessdate=28 August 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Sept29\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/09/falcon-9-hot-fires-engines-iss-prepares-dragons-arrival/ |title=Falcon 9 hot fires its engines as the ISS prepares for Dragon's arrival |last=Bergin |first=Chris |date=29 September 2012 |publisher=NASASpaceFlight (not associated with NASA) |accessdate=29 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AugustChris\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/08/spacex-conduct-successful-wdr-falcon-9/ |title=SpaceX conduct successful WDR on their latest Falcon 9 |last=Bergin |first=Chris |date=31 August 2012 |publisher=NASASpaceFlight (not associated with NASA) |accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|SpaceX CRS-1}}\n*[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/living/launch/index.html SpaceX CRS-1 NASA page]\n*[http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/694166main_SpaceXCRS-1PressKit.pdf SpaceX CRS-1 Mission Press Kit (4 October 2012)]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I7loLnDYyU Video of Static Fire test -

The plan called for two of the first-stage engines to shut down to reduce the rocket's acceleration at approximately 2 minutes 30 seconds into the flight when the Falcon 9 would nominally be {{convert|90|km|mi}} high and traveling at 10 times the speed of sound. The remaining engines were planned to cut off shortly after\u2014an event known as main-engine cutoff (MECO). Five seconds after MECO, the first and second stages separate. Seven seconds later, the second stage's single Merlin vacuum engine was projected to ignite to begin a 6-minute, 14-second burn to put Dragon into [[low-Earth orbit]]. Forty seconds after second-stage ignition, Dragon's protective nose cone, which covers Dragon's berthing mechanism, was planned to be jettisoned. At the 9-minute, 14-second mark after launch, the second-stage engine was scheduled to cut off (SECO). Thirty-five seconds later, Dragon was planned to separate from Falcon 9's second stage and reach its preliminary orbit. The dragon would, per plan, then deploy its solar arrays and open its guidance and navigation control (GNC) bay door which holds the sensors necessary for rendezvous and Dragon's [[Power Data Grapple Fixture|grapple fixture]].<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\n=== Flight day 2 (9 October) ===\nThe mission plan called for the Dragon spacecraft to perform a coelliptic burn that would place it in a circular [[coelliptic orbit]].<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\n=== Flight day 3 (10 October) ===\nAs Dragon chased the [[International Space Station]], the spacecraft established UHF communication using its COTS Ultra-high-frequency Communication Unit (CUCU). Also, using the crew command panel (CCP) onboard the station, the expedition crew monitored the approach. This ability for the crew to send commands to Dragon is important during the rendezvous and departure phases of the mission.<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\nDuring the final approach to the station, a go/no-go was performed by [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center#FCR 1 (2006-present)|Mission Control Houston]] and the SpaceX team in Hawthorne to allow Dragon to perform another engine burn that brought it {{convert|250|m|ft}} from the station. At this distance, Dragon began using its close-range guidance systems, composed of [[LIDAR]] and thermal imagers. These systems confirmed that Dragon's position and velocity are accurate by comparing the LIDAR image that Dragon receives against Dragon's thermal imagers. The Dragon flight control team in Hawthorne, with assistance from the NASA flight control team at the Johnson Space Center's International Space Station Flight Control Room, commanded the spacecraft to approach the station from its hold position. After another go/no-go was performed by the Houston and Hawthorne teams, Dragon was permitted to enter the Keep-Out Sphere (KOS), an imaginary sphere drawn {{convert|200|m|ft}} around the station that reduces the risk of collision. Dragon proceeded to a position {{convert|30|m|ft}} from the station and was automatically held. Another go/no-go was completed. Then Dragon proceeded to the {{convert|10|m|ft}} position\u2014the capture point. A final go/no-go was performed, and the Mission Control Houston team notified the crew they were going for the capture of Dragon.<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\nAt that point, Expedition 33 crewmember [[Akihiko Hoshide]] of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency used the station's {{convert|17.6|m|ft}} robotic arm, known as [[Mobile Servicing System#Canadarm2 |Canadarm2]], reached for and grappled the Dragon spacecraft at 10:56 UTC.<ref name=SPACENOW10/> Hoshide, with the help of Expedition 33 Commander [[Sunita Williams]] of NASA, guided Dragon to the Earth-facing side of the station's [[Harmony module]]. Williams and Hoshide swapped places and Williams gently berthed Dragon to Harmony's [[Common Berthing Mechanism]] at 13:03 UTC.<ref name=SPACENOW10/>\n\nThe opening of the hatch between Dragon and the Harmony module, which was originally not scheduled to occur until 11 October, was moved up and occurred at 17:40 UTC.<ref name=SPACENOW10/>\n\n=== Remainder of mission (11 to 28 October) ===\n[[File:SpX CRS-1 berthed - cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Dragon as seen from [[Cupola (ISS module)|Cupola]] on 14 October 2012]]\nOver a period of two and a half weeks, the ISS crew unloaded Dragon's payload and reloaded it with cargo for return to Earth.<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>{{Failed verification|date=November 2012}}<!-- a source from before the flight does not confirm that the planned event became a past-tense historical fact; needs a better source, or the prose needs to speak to the mission plan as outlined in the presskit -->\n\nAfter its mission at the orbital laboratory was completed, newly arrived Expedition 33 Flight Engineer [[Kevin A. Ford|Kevin Ford]] used the Canadarm2 robotic arm to detach Dragon from Harmony, maneuver it out to the 15-meter (50-foot) release point, and release the vehicle. Dragon then performed a series of three burns to place it on a trajectory away from the station. Approximately six hours after Dragon departed the station, it conducted a deorbit burn, which lasted up to 10 minutes. Dragon's trunk, which contains its solar arrays, was then jettisoned.<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>{{Failed verification|date=November 2012}}<!-- a source from before the flight does not confirm that the planned event became a past-tense historical fact; needs a better source, or the prose needs to speak to the mission plan as outlined in the presskit -->\n[[File:SpX-1 Dragon at port.1.jpg|thumb|left|The SpX-1 capsule seen back at port on 30 October 2012]]\nThe landing was controlled by automatic firing of its [[Draco (rocket engine family)#Draco|Draco]] thrusters during [[Atmospheric entry|reentry]].{{Failed verification|date=November 2012}}<!-- a source from before the flight does not confirm that the planned event became a past-tense historical fact; needs a better source, or the prose needs to speak to the mission plan as outlined in the presskit --> In a carefully timed sequence of events, dual [[drogue parachute]]s deploy at an altitude of {{convert|13700|m|ft|abbr=on}} to stabilize and slow the spacecraft.

SpaceX uses a 100-foot boat equipped with an A-frame and an articulating crane, a 90-foot crew boat for telemetry operations, and two 24-foot rigid-hull inflatable boats to perform recovery operations. On board are approximately a dozen SpaceX engineers and technicians as well as a four-person dive team. Once the Dragon capsule splashed down, the recovery team secured the vehicle and then placed it on deck for the journey back to shore.{{Failed verification|date=November 2012}}<!-- a source from before the flight does not confirm that the planned event became a past-tense historical fact; needs a better source, or the prose needs to speak to the mission plan as outlined in the presskit --><ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\nSpaceX technicians opened the side hatch of the vehicle and retrieved the time-critical items.

The higher the orbit, the more test data [Orbcomm] can gather, so they requested that we attempt to restart and raise altitude. NASA agreed to allow that, but only on condition that there be substantial propellant reserves, since the orbit would be close to the space station.  It is important to appreciate that Orbcomm understood from the beginning that the orbit-raising maneuver was tentative. They accepted that there was a high risk of their satellite remaining at the Dragon insertion orbit. SpaceX would not have agreed to fly their satellite otherwise, since this was not part of the core mission and there was a known, material risk of no altitude raise.}}</ref><ref name=\"orbcomm total loss\">[http://spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/004/121011orbcomm/ Orbcomm craft falls to Earth, company claims total loss]</ref>\n\nBoth SpaceX and Orbcomm were aware, prior to the mission, of the high risk that the secondary payload satellite could remain at the lower altitude of the Dragon insertion orbit, and that was a risk that Orbcomm agreed to take given the dramatically lower cost of launch for a secondary payload.<ref name=sn20121011/>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Launch attempts ==\n\n{{LaunchAttempt\n|df=yes| date1 = 2012-10-08 00:34:07 UTC\n| result1 = Partial Success: success for primary payload, failure for secondary payload\n| reason1 = \n| decision_date1 = \n| decision_clock1= \n| weathergo1 = 80<ref name=\"NASA EH\">{{cite video |title=NASA Education Hour |publisher=NASA TV |date=8 October 2012 |location=Television}}</ref><ref name=\"NASA Station Archive\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/living/launch/crs_rss_feed_collection_archive_1.html |title='Everything is Looking Real Good for Launch' |publisher=NASA |date=7 October 2012 |accessdate=7 October 2012}}</ref>\n| notes1 = At 79 seconds into the launch, Engine 1 lost pressure and was commanded by the rocket to shut down.<ref name=\"SpaceX CRS-1 Mission Update\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spacex.com/press/2012/12/19/spacex-crs-1-mission-update|title=SPACEX CRS-1 MISSION UPDATE |accessdate=9 October 2012}}</ref> Due to the engine failure on the first stage, safety protocols for rendezvous with the ISS prevented the secondary-payload Orbcomm Satellite from being placed in the correct orbit.<ref name=\"Orbcomm OG2\">{{cite web |url=https://www.orbcomm.com/pdf/files/ORBCOMM_Launches_Prototype_OG2_Satellite_FINAL.pdf |title=ORBCOMM LAUNCHES PROTOTYPE OG2 SATELLITE |accessdate=9 October 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021004407/http://www.orbcomm.com/Collateral/Documents/English-US/ORBCOMM%20Launches%20Prototype%20OG2%20Satellite%20FINAL.pdf |archive-date=21 October 2012}}</ref>}}\n\n== Falcon 9 engine anomaly ==\n[[File:SpaceX CRS-1 Launch.ogv|thumb|right|Video of the launch of SpaceX CRS-1 Falcon 9]]\n\nDuring the ascent, 79 seconds<ref name=innerspace20121009 /> after launch, an engine anomaly occurred with one of the nine engines on the Falcon 9 first stage.

During flight, the data suggests this material flaw ultimately developed into a breach in the main combustion chamber. This breach released a jet of hot gas and fuel in the direction of the main fuel line causing a secondary leak and ultimately a rapid drop in engine pressure. As a result, the flight computer commanded shutdown of engine 1 and Falcon 9 continued on its path to ensure Dragon's entry into orbit for subsequent rendezvous and berthing with the ISS.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aviationweek.com/blog/spacex-engine-anomaly-overview |title=SpaceX: Engine Anomaly Overview |publisher=Aviationweek.com |date= |accessdate=8 October 2013}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Spaceflight}}\n* [[List of Falcon 9 launches]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist |colwidth=30em |refs=\n\n<ref name=HARTMAN>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/672214main_1-Hartman_July12_NAC_Final_508.pdf |title=International Space Station Program Status |last=Hartman |first=Dan |date=23 July 2012 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Presskit\">\n{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/694166main_SpaceXCRS-1PressKit.pdf |title=SpX CRS-1 Mission Press Kit |date=4 October 2012 |publisher=NASA, SpaceX, 45th Space Wing |accessdate=6 October 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"SpaceX Launch Manifest\">\n{{cite web |title=SpaceX Launch Manifest |publisher=SpaceX |url=http://www.spacex.com/launch_manifest.php |accessdate=31 May 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"NASA Launch Schedule\">\n{{cite web |title=NASA's Consolidated Launch Schedule |publisher=NASA |url=http://www.nasa.gov/missions/highlights/schedule.html |accessdate=21 June 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"NASAsept20\">\n{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/spacex-crs1-target.html |title=SpaceX, NASA Target Oct. 7 Launch For Resupply Mission To Space Station |date=20 September 2012 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=26 September 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Clark 18 May 2012\">\n{{cite web |last=Clark |first=Stephen |date=18 May 2012 |title=SpaceX's historic commercial mission is 'just a test flight' |publisher=SpaceFlightNow |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/003/120518commercial/ |accessdate=25 August 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=ClarkOct28>{{cite web |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/004/121028splashdown/#.UI_fCIa_PKg |title=Return of the Dragon: Commercial craft back home |last=Clark |first=Stephen |date=28 October 2012 |publisher=SpaceFlightNow |accessdate=30 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Clark 24 August 2012\">\n{{cite web |title=NASA ready for operational cargo flights by SpaceX |last=Clark |first=Stephen |date=24 August 2012 |publisher=SpaceFlightNow |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1208/24cots/ |accessdate=25 August 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=SPACENOW10>{{cite web |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/004/121010arrival/ |title=Dragon arrives at station with commercial delivery |last=Clark |first=Stephen |date=10 October 2012 |publisher=SpaceFlightNow |accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Orbcomm 25 May 2012\">\n{{cite press |title=Orbcomm Eagerly Awaits Launch of New Satellite on Next Falcon 9 |date=25 May 2012 |publisher=Space News |url=http://www.spacenews.com/satellite_telecom/120525-spacex-success-welcome-orbcomm.html |accessdate=28 May 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Hartman 23 July 2012\">\n{{cite web |last=Hartman |first=Dan |date=23 July 2012 |title=International Space Station Program Status |publisher=NASA |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/672214main_1-Hartman_July12_NAC_Final_508.pdf |accessdate=28 August 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Sept29\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/09/falcon-9-hot-fires-engines-iss-prepares-dragons-arrival/ |title=Falcon 9 hot fires its engines as the ISS prepares for Dragon's arrival |last=Bergin |first=Chris |date=29 September 2012 |publisher=NASASpaceFlight (not associated with NASA) |accessdate=29 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AugustChris\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/08/spacex-conduct-successful-wdr-falcon-9/ |title=SpaceX conduct successful WDR on their latest Falcon 9 |last=Bergin |first=Chris |date=31 August 2012 |publisher=NASASpaceFlight (not associated with NASA) |accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|SpaceX CRS-1}}\n*[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/living/launch/index.html SpaceX CRS-1 NASA page]\n*[http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/694166main_SpaceXCRS-1PressKit.pdf SpaceX CRS-1 Mission Press Kit (4 October 2012)]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I7loLnDYyU Video of Static Fire test -
