The [[Wabash and Erie Canal]], built through the county in 1840 and operating until the early 1870s, is among the county's most significant historical legacies.\n\n=== Courthouse ===\nThe current [[Carroll County Courthouse (Delphi, Indiana)|Carroll County courthouse]] was designed by [[Elmer E. Dunlap]] of [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]], who also designed the [[Spencer County, Indiana|Spencer County]] courthouse.  It was constructed by A. E. Kemmer at a cost of about $250,000 from 1916 to 1917.  The exterior is understated, but the interior is surprisingly elaborate, including a stained glass dome over a mosaic tile floor.\n\nThis building is the county's third courthouse.  The first was built in 1831\u20131838.  It was replaced by a brick structure in 1856; this building was designed by M. J. McBird of [[Logansport, Indiana|Logansport]] and had a tower at each corner, including a clock tower.  The 730-pound bell from the first courthouse was made in Cincinnati in 1836 and given by Sheriff Samuel Davis Gresham, and was used in the second courthouse until 1916.  While the bell was in transit to [[Lafayette, Indiana|Lafayette]] by boat, the boat sank; the bell was later recovered from the [[Ohio River]].  It was later sold, but was returned to Carroll County in 1967.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Counts\n  | first = Will\n  |author2=Jon Dilts\n  | title = The 92 Magnificent Indiana Courthouses\n  | publisher = Indiana University Press\n  | year = 1991\n  | location = Bloomington, Indiana\n  | isbn = 978-0-253-33638-5\n  | pages = 22\u201323}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\nAccording to the 2010 census, the county has a total area of {{convert|375.02|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|372.22|sqmi}} (or 99.25%) is land and {{convert|2.80|sqmi}} (or 0.75%) is water.<ref name=\"census-density\"/>\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n*[[Cass County, Indiana|Cass County]]  (northeast)\n*[[Howard County, Indiana|Howard County]]  (east)\n*[[Clinton County, Indiana|Clinton County]]  (south)\n*[[Tippecanoe County, Indiana|Tippecanoe County]]  (southwest)\n*[[White County, Indiana|White County]]  (northwest)\n\n=== Cities and towns ===\n{|\n|----- valign=\"top\"\n|\n*[[Burlington, Indiana|Burlington]] (Town)\n*[[Camden, Indiana|Camden]] (Town)\n*[[Delphi, Indiana|Delphi]] (City)\n|\n*[[Flora, Indiana|Flora]] (Town)\n*[[Yeoman, Indiana|Yeoman]] (Town)\n|}\n\n=== Unincorporated towns ===\n{|\n|----- valign=\"top\"\n|\n*[[Bringhurst, Indiana|Bringhurst]]\n*[[Burrows, Indiana|Burrows]]\n*[[Cutler, Indiana|Cutler]]\n*[[Deer Creek, Carroll County, Indiana|Deer Creek]]\n*[[Lockport, Indiana|Lockport]]\n|\n*[[Ockley, Indiana|Ockley]]\n*[[Owasco, Indiana|Owasco]]\n*[[Pittsburg, Indiana|Pittsburg]]\n*[[Radnor, Indiana|Radnor]]\n*[[Rockfield, Indiana|Rockfield]]\n|\n*[[Sharon, Indiana|Sharon]]\n*[[Sleeth, Indiana|Sleeth]]\n*[[Wheeling, Carroll County, Indiana|Wheeling]]\n|}\n\n=== Extinct towns ===\n{|\n|----- valign=\"top\"\n|\n*[[Carrollton, Carroll County, Indiana|Carrollton]]\n*[[Lexington, Carroll County, Indiana|Lexington]]\n|\n*[[Prince William, Indiana|Prince William]]\n*[[Woodville, Carroll County, Indiana|Woodville]]\n|}\n\n=== Townships ===\n[[Image:Carroll County, Indiana cloudscape.png|thumb|right|250px|Rainbow-fringed clouds above a farm and soybean fields in rural Jackson Township.]]\n{|\n|----- valign=\"top\"\n|\n*[[Adams Township, Carroll County, Indiana|Adams]]\n*[[Burlington Township, Carroll County, Indiana|Burlington]]\n*[[Carrollton Township, Carroll County, Indiana|Carrollton]]\n*[[Clay Township, Carroll County, Indiana|Clay]]\n*[[Deer Creek Township, Carroll County, Indiana|Deer Creek]]\n*[[Democrat Township, Carroll County, Indiana|Democrat]]\n*[[Jackson Township, Carroll County, Indiana|Jackson]]\n|\n*[[Jefferson Township, Carroll County, Indiana|Jefferson]]\n*[[Liberty Township, Carroll County, Indiana|Liberty]]\n*[[Madison Township, Carroll County, Indiana|Madison]]\n*[[Monroe Township, Carroll County, Indiana|Monroe]]\n*[[Rock Creek Township, Carroll County, Indiana|Rock Creek]]\n*[[Tippecanoe Township, Carroll County, Indiana|Tippecanoe]]\n*[[Washington Township, Carroll County, Indiana|Washington]]\n|}\n\n===Major highways===\n*[[Image:US 421.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 421]]\n*[[Image:indiana 18.svg|20px]] [[Indiana State Road 18]]\n*[[Image:indiana 22.svg|20px]] [[Indiana State Road 22]]\n*[[Image:indiana 25.svg|20px]] [[Indiana State Road 25]]\n*[[Image:indiana 29.svg|20px]] [[Indiana State Road 29]]\n*[[Image:indiana 39.svg|20px]] [[Indiana State Road 39]]\n*[[Image:indiana 75.svg|20px]] [[Indiana State Road 75]]\n*[[Image:indiana 218.svg|20px]] [[Indiana State Road 218]]\n\n=== Railroads ===\n*[[Norfolk Southern Railway]]\n*[[Winamac Southern Railway]]\n\n== Climate and weather ==\n{{climate chart\n|[[Delphi, Indiana]]\n|17|33|1.99\n|21|39|1.94\n|31|51|2.94\n|40|64|3.45\n|50|74|3.90\n|60|83|4.07\n|63|86|4.16\n|61|84|3.98\n|53|78|2.94\n|42|66|2.70\n|33|51|3.10\n|23|38|2.68\n|float=right\n|units=imperial\n|clear=both\n|source=The Weather Channel<ref name=\"weather\">{{cite web\n  |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USIN0156\n  |title=Monthly Averages for Delphi, Indiana\n  |accessdate=2011-01-27\n  |publisher=The Weather Channel\n}}</ref>}}\nIn recent years, average temperatures in Delphi have ranged from a low of {{convert|17|\u00b0F}} in January to a high of {{convert|86|\u00b0F}} in July, although a record low of {{convert|-25|\u00b0F}} was recorded in January 1963 and a record high of {{convert|107|\u00b0F}} was recorded in July 1954.

Dunlap]] of [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]], who also designed the [[Spencer County, Indiana|Spencer County]] courthouse.  It was constructed by A. E. Kemmer at a cost of about $250,000 from 1916 to 1917.  The exterior is understated, but the interior is surprisingly elaborate, including a stained glass dome over a mosaic tile floor.\n\nThis building is the county's third courthouse.  The first was built in 1831-1838.  It was replaced by a brick structure in 1856; this building was designed by M. J. McBird of [[Logansport, Indiana|Logansport]] and had a tower at each corner, including a clock tower.  The 730-pound bell from the first courthouse was made in Cincinnati in 1836 and given by Sheriff Samuel Davis Gresham, and was used in the second courthouse until 1916.  While the bell was in transit to [[Lafayette, Indiana|Lafayette]] by boat, the boat sank; the bell was later recovered from the [[Ohio River]].
