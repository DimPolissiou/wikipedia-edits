This is derived from the Old English tribal name ''[[H\u00e6stingas]]'', meaning `the constituency (followers) of H\u00e6sta'. [[Symeon of Durham]] records the victory of [[Offa]] in 771 over the ''Hestingorum gens'', that is, \"the people of the Hastings tribe.\" [[Hastingleigh]] in Kent was named after that tribe.

However, the absence of any archaeological remains of or documentary evidence for a Roman fort at Hastings suggest that ''H\u00e6stingaceaster'' may refer to a different settlement, most likely that based on the Roman remains at [[Pevensey]].<ref>Pamela Combes and Malcolm Lyne, \"Hastings, Haestingaceaster and Haestingaport: a question of identity,\" ''Sussex Archaeological Collections'', 133 (1995), 213\u201324. {{ISSN|0143-8204}}</ref>\n\nEvidence of prehistoric settlements have been found at the town site: flint arrowheads and [[Bronze Age]] artefacts have been found. [[Iron Age]] forts have been excavated on both the East and West Hills. This suggests that the inhabitants moved early to the safety of the valley in between the forts. The settlement was already based on the port when the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] arrived in Britain for the first time in 55&nbsp;BC. At this time, they began to [[Iron industry of Ashdown Forest|exploit the iron]] (Wealden rocks provide a plentiful supply of the ore), and shipped it out by boat. Iron was worked locally at [[Beauport Park]], to the north of the town. It employed up to one thousand men and is considered to have been the third-largest mine in the [[Roman Empire]].<ref name=\"OpenLearn\">{{cite web|url=http://www.open.edu/openlearn/history-the-arts/history/beauport-park-east-sussex|title=Beauport Park, East Sussex|date=22 June 2006|work=[[OpenLearn]]|publisher=[[Open University]]|accessdate=10 August 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006145624/http://www.open.edu/openlearn/history-the-arts/history/beauport-park-east-sussex|archivedate=6 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> There was also a possible iron-working site near Blacklands Church in the town - the old name of 'Ponbay Bridge' for a bridge that used to exist in the area is a corruption of 'Pond Bay' as suggested by Thomas Ross (Mayor of Hastings and author of an 1835 guide book)<ref name=\"historymap.info\">Historical Hastings Wiki: [http://wiki.historymap.info/Iron_Working Iron Working - Historical Hastings Wiki], accessdate: 10 December 2019</ref>\n\nWith the departure of the Romans, the town suffered setbacks. The Beauport site was abandoned, and the town suffered from problems from nature and man-made attacks. The Sussex coast has always suffered from occasional violent storms; with the additional hazard of [[longshore drift]] (the eastward movement of shingle along the coast), the coastline has been frequently changing.

It is thought that the Norman encampment was on the town's outskirts, where there was open ground; a new town was already being built in the valley to the east. That \"New Burgh\" was founded in 1069 and is mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]] as such. [[William the Conqueror|William]] defeated and killed [[Harold Godwinson]], the last Saxon King of England, and destroyed his army, thus opening England to the Norman conquest.\n\nWilliam caused a castle to be built at Hastings probably using the earthworks of the existing Saxon castle.\n\nHastings was shown as a [[borough]] by the time of the [[Domesday Book]] (1086); it had also given its name to the [[Rape of Hastings]], one of the six administrative divisions of Sussex. As a borough, Hastings had a [[corporation]] consisting of a \"bailiff, jurats, and commonalty\". By a Charter of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in 1589, the bailiff was replaced by a mayor.\n\nMuslim scholar [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]], writing c.1153, described Hastings as \"a town of large extent and many inhabitants, flourishing and handsome, having markets, workpeople and rich merchants\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cartographyunchained.com/pdfs/cgid1_pdf.pdf |title=Al-Idrisi; The Book of Roger The description of L'Angleterre |accessdate=2016-12-19 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922081246/http://www.cartographyunchained.com/pdfs/cgid1_pdf.pdf |archivedate=22 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Hastings and the sea===\n[[File:Joseph Mallord William Turner - The Fish Market at Hastings Beach - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''The Fish Market at Hastings Beach'', [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]] (1810)]]\n\nBy the end of the Saxon period, the port of Hastings had moved eastward near the present town centre in the Priory Stream valley, whose entrance was protected by the White Rock headland (since demolished). It was to be a short stay: Danish attacks and huge floods in 1011 and 1014 motivated the townspeople to relocate to the New Burgh.\n\nIn the Middle Ages Hastings became one of the [[Cinque Ports]]; [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]], [[Dover]] and [[New Romney]] being the first, Hastings and [[Hythe, Kent|Hythe]] followed, all finally being joined by [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye]] and [[Winchelsea]], at one point 42 towns were directly or indirectly affiliated with the group.\n\n[[File:Hastings Castle 2012-07-28.jpg|thumb|[[Hastings Castle]], with the Pier and Town Centre in the background, and [[Eastbourne]] on the horizon]]\n\nIn the 13th century, much of the town and half of [[Hastings Castle]] was washed away in the [[South England flood of February 1287]]. During a [[English Channel naval campaign, 1338-1339|naval campaign of 1339]], and again in 1377, the town was raided and burnt by the French, and seems then to have gone into a decline. As a port, Hastings' days were finished.\n\n[[File:Hastings town centre postcard.jpg|thumb|left|Hastings town centre and the Memorial from an old postcard]]\nHastings had suffered over the years from the lack of a natural harbour, and there have been attempts to create a sheltered harbour. Attempts were made to build a stone harbour during the reign of [[Elizabeth I]], but the foundations were destroyed by the sea in terrible storms. The fishing boats are still stored on and launched from the beach.\n\nHastings was then just a small fishing settlement, but it was soon discovered that the new taxes on luxury goods could be made profitable by smuggling; the town was ideally located for that purpose.<ref name=\"Smuggling on the Sussex Coast\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hmag.org.uk/LocalHistory/ |title=Hastings Museum |publisher=Smuggling on the Sussex Coast |accessdate=10 February 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318003820/http://www.hmag.org.uk/LocalHistory/ |archivedate=18 March 2009 }}</ref> Near the castle ruins, on the West Hill, are \"[[St Clement's Caves]]\", partly natural, but mainly excavated by hand by smugglers from the soft sandstone. Their trade was to come to an end with the period following the [[Napoleonic Wars]], for the town became one of the most fashionable resorts in Britain, brought about by the so-called health-giving properties of seawater, as well as the local springs and Roman baths. Once this came about the expansion of the town took place, to the west, since there was little space left in the valley.\n\n[[File:Bottle Alley Hastings.jpg|thumb|right|The double decker promenade that runs from Hastings Pier beyond Marine Court (seen in the distance), with a break at Warrior Square, was built in the 1930s by the borough engineer [[Sidney Little]]]]\nIt was at this time that the elegant Pelham Crescent and Wellington Square were built: other building followed. In the Crescent (designed by architect [[Joseph Kay (architect)|Joseph Kay]]) is the classical style church of St Mary in the Castle (its name recalling the old chapel in the castle above) now in use as an arts centre. The building of the crescent and the church necessitated further cutting away of the castle hill cliffs. Once that move away from the old town had begun, it led to the further expansion along the coast, eventually linking up with the new [[St Leonards-on-Sea|St Leonards]].\n\nThe extensive development meant that a large transient work-force was required. Many of the people coming in to Hastings at this time, settled on some waste-ground to the west of the main town called the [[America Ground]]. This land, originally a shingle spit created by the great storm of 1287, was declared to be Crown Property after an inquiry held at [[Battle, East Sussex|Battle]] during 1827 and the land was cleared in preparation for the development of this area of land by [[Patrick Francis Robertson]].<ref>[http://wiki.historymap.info/Category:America_Ground Hastings local history Wiki]</ref>\n\n{{main|Hastings Old Town}}\n\n[[File:Historische Altstadt-Hastings.JPG|thumb|left|George Street, Old town]]\nLike many coastal towns, the population of Hastings grew significantly as a result of the construction of railway links and the fashionable growth of seaside holidays during the [[Victorian era]]. In 1801, its population was a mere 3,175; by 1831, it had reached over ten thousand; by 1891, it was almost sixty thousand.\n\nThe last harbour project began in 1896, but this also failed when structural problems and rising costs exhausted all the available funds. Today a fractured seawall is all that remains of what might have become a magnificent harbour. In 1897, the foundation stone was laid on a large concrete structure, but there was insufficient money to complete the work and the \"Harbour arm\" remains uncompleted. It was later partially blown up to discourage possible use by German invasion forces during World War II.\n\nBetween 1903 and 1919 Fred Judge FRPS photographed many of the towns events and disasters.  These included storms, the first tram, visit of the Lord Mayor of London, Hastings Marathon Race and the pier fire of 1917. Many of these images were produced as picture postcards by the British Postcard manufacturer he founded now known as [[Judges Postcards]].\n\nIn the 1930s, the town underwent some rejuvenation. Seaside resorts were starting to go out of fashion: Hastings perhaps more than most. The town council set about a huge rebuilding project, among which the promenade was rebuilt, and an Olympic-size bathing pool was erected. The latter, regarded in its day as one of the best open-air swimming and diving complexes in Europe, later became a holiday camp before closing in 1986. It was demolished, but the area is still known by locals as \"The Old Bathing Pool\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seasidehistory.co.uk/hastings_lido.html|title=The Bathing Pool at Hastings and St Leonards|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517053426/http://seasidehistory.co.uk/hastings_lido.html|archivedate=17 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n[[File:Hastings Old Town July 1965.jpg|thumb|Hastings Old Town July 1965.]]\nThe 2001 census reported over 85,000 inhabitants.\n\n==Governance==\n[[File:EastSussexHastings.png|thumb|right|Borough of Hastings, shown within East Sussex]]\n\n{{details|Hastings and Rye (UK Parliament constituency)}}\nHastings returned two [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] from the 14th century until 1885, since when it has returned one.

Prior to 1983, the town formed  the [[Hastings (UK Parliament constituency)|Hastings parliamentary constituency]] by itself.\n\nHastings, it is thought, was a Saxon town before the arrival of the Normans: the [[Domesday Book]] refers to a ''new Borough'': as a borough, Hastings had a [[corporation]] consisting of a \"bailiff, jurats, and commonalty\".<ref name=\"Hastings Past\"/> Its importance was such that it also gave its name to one of the six [[Rape (county subdivision)|Rapes]] or administrative districts of Sussex.\n\n[[File:Hastings Town Hall - geograph.org.uk - 1197481.jpg|thumb|left|Hastings Town Hall]]\nBy a Charter of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in 1589 the bailiff was replaced by a mayor, by which time the town's importance was dwindling. In the [[Georgian era]], patronage of such seaside places (such as nearby [[Brighton]]) gave it a new lease of life so that, when the time came with the reform of English local government in 1888, Hastings became a [[County Borough]], responsible for all its local services, independent of the surrounding county, then Sussex (East); less than one hundred years later, [[Local Government Act 1972|in 1974]], that status was abolished.\n\nHastings Borough Council is now in the second tier of local government, below [[East Sussex County Council]].

In Victorian times and later the town has spread westwards and northwards, and now forms a single urban centre with the more suburban area of [[St Leonards-on-Sea]] to the west. Roads from the Old Town valley lead towards the Victorian area of Clive Vale and the former village of [[Ore, Sussex|Ore]], from which \"The Ridge\", marking the effective boundary of Hastings, extends north-westwards towards [[Battle, East Sussex|Battle]]. Beyond [[Bulverhythe]], the western end of Hastings is marked by low-lying land known as [[Glyne Gap]], separating it from [[Bexhill-on-Sea]].\n\nThe sandstone cliffs have been the subject of considerable erosion in relatively recent times: much of the Castle was lost to the sea before the present sea defences and promenade were built, and a number of cliff-top houses are in danger of disappearing around the nearby village of [[Fairlight, East Sussex|Fairlight]].\n\nThe beach is mainly shingle, although wide areas of sand are uncovered at low tide. The town is generally built upon a series of low hills rising to {{convert|500|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] at \"The Ridge\" before falling back in the river valley further to the north.\n\n[[File:Fossilised dinosaur footprint fairlght cliffs 2007.JPG|thumb|right|Dinosaur footprint found amongst rocks at the cliff base]]\nThere are three [[Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] within the borough; [[Marline Valley Woods]], [[Combe Haven]] and [[Hastings Country Park|Hastings Cliffs To Pett Beach]]. Marline Valley Woods lies within the Ashdown ward of Hastings. It is an [[ancient woodland]] of [[Quercus robur|Pedunculate oak]]\u2014[[Carpinus betulus|hornbeam]] which is uncommon nationally.

areas===\nSome of the areas and suburbs of Hastings are [[Ore Valley]], [[St Leonards on Sea|St Leonards]], [[Silverhill, East Sussex|Silverhill]], [[Bulverhythe|West St Leonards]], and [[Hollington, East Sussex|Hollington]]. Ore, Silverhill and Hollington were once villages that have since become part of the Hastings conurbation area during rapid growth.<ref name=\"Wards\"/> The original part St Leonards was bought by [[James Burton (property developer)|James Burton]] and laid out by his son, the architect [[Decimus Burton]], in the early 19th century as a new town: a place of elegant houses designed for the well-off; it also included a central public garden, a hotel, an archery, [[assembly rooms]] and [[St Leonard's Church, St Leonards-on-Sea|a church]]. Today's St Leonards has extended well beyond that original design, although the original town still exists within it.<ref name=\"1066stl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.1066online.co.uk/hastings-history/burtons-st-leonards/burton-st-leonards-history.htm|title=Burton's St Leonards|publisher=1066online|accessdate=29 June 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101223206/http://www.1066online.co.uk/hastings-history/burtons-st-leonards/burton-st-leonards-history.htm|archivedate=1 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Demography==\nThe population of the town in 2001 was 85,029, by 2009 the estimated population was 86,900. Hastings suffers at a disadvantage insofar as growth is concerned because of its restricted situation, lying as it does with the [[High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] to the north. Redevelopment of the area is partly hampered by the split administration of the combined Hastings and Bexhill economic region between Hastings and [[Rother District|Rother]] district councils. There is little space for further large-scale housing and employment growth within the designated boundaries of Hastings, and development on the outskirts is resisted by Rother council whose administrative area surrounds Hastings. Rother has a policy of urban expansion in the area immediately north of Bexhill, but this requires infrastructure improvements by central Governments which have been under discussion for decades.<ref name=\"Local Development Framework\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hastings.gov.uk/ldf/amr.pdf |title=Local Development Framework |publisher=Hastings Online |accessdate=17 February 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060309142442/http://www.hastings.gov.uk/ldf/amr.pdf |archivedate=9 March 2006 }}</ref> This situation has now become the subject of parliamentary consideration.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmselect/cmcomloc/351/35113.htm|title=House of Commons - Communities and Local Government Committee - Second Report|first=The Committee Office, House of|last=Commons|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027065240/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmselect/cmcomloc/351/35113.htm|archivedate=27 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Ethnicity===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

[[Symeon of Durham]] records the victory of [[Offa]] in 771 over the ''Hestingorum gens'', that is, \"the people of the Hastings tribe.\" [[Hastingleigh]] in Kent was named after that tribe.

However, the absence of any archaeological remains of or documentary evidence for a Roman fort at Hastings suggest that ''H\u00e6stingaceaster'' may refer to a different settlement, most likely that based on the Roman remains at [[Pevensey]].<ref>Pamela Combes and Malcolm Lyne, \"Hastings, Haestingaceaster and Haestingaport: a question of identity,\" ''Sussex Archaeological Collections'', 133 (1995), 213\u201324. {{ISSN|0143-8204}}</ref>\n\nEvidence of prehistoric settlements have been found at the town site: flint arrowheads and [[Bronze Age]] artefacts have been found. [[Iron Age]] forts have been excavated on both the East and West Hills. This suggests that the inhabitants moved early to the safety of the valley in between the forts. The settlement was already based on the port when the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] arrived in Britain for the first time in 55&nbsp;BC. At this time, they began to [[Iron industry of Ashdown Forest|exploit the iron]] (Wealden rocks provide a plentiful supply of the ore), and shipped it out by boat.

The Beauport site was abandoned, and the town suffered from problems from nature and man-made attacks.

It is thought that the Norman encampment was on the town's outskirts, where there was open ground; a new town was already being built in the valley to the east. That \"New Burgh\" was founded in 1069 and is mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]] as such. [[William the Conqueror|William]] defeated and killed [[Harold Godwinson]], the last Saxon King of England, and destroyed his army, thus opening England to the Norman conquest.\n\nWilliam caused a castle to be built at Hastings probably using the earthworks of the existing Saxon castle.\n\nHastings was shown as a [[borough]] by the time of the [[Domesday Book]] (1086); it had also given its name to the [[Rape of Hastings]], one of the six administrative divisions of Sussex. As a borough, Hastings had a [[corporation]] consisting of a \"bailiff, jurats, and commonalty\". By a Charter of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in 1589, the bailiff was replaced by a mayor.\n\nMuslim scholar [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]], writing c.1153, described Hastings as \"a town of large extent and many inhabitants, flourishing and handsome, having markets, workpeople and rich merchants\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cartographyunchained.com/pdfs/cgid1_pdf.pdf |title=Al-Idrisi; The Book of Roger The description of L'Angleterre |accessdate=2016-12-19 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922081246/http://www.cartographyunchained.com/pdfs/cgid1_pdf.pdf |archivedate=22 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Hastings and the sea===\n[[File:Joseph Mallord William Turner - The Fish Market at Hastings Beach - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''The Fish Market at Hastings Beach'', [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]] (1810)]]\n\nBy the end of the Saxon period, the port of Hastings had moved eastward near the present town centre in the Priory Stream valley, whose entrance was protected by the White Rock headland (since demolished). It was to be a short stay: Danish attacks and huge floods in 1011 and 1014 motivated the townspeople to relocate to the New Burgh.\n\nIn the Middle Ages Hastings became one of the [[Cinque Ports]]; [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]], [[Dover]] and [[New Romney]] being the first, Hastings and [[Hythe, Kent|Hythe]] followed, all finally being joined by [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye]] and [[Winchelsea]], at one point 42 towns were directly or indirectly affiliated with the group.\n\n[[File:Hastings Castle 2012-07-28.jpg|thumb|[[Hastings Castle]], with the Pier and Town Centre in the background, and [[Eastbourne]] on the horizon]]\n\nIn the 13th century, much of the town and half of [[Hastings Castle]] was washed away in the [[South England flood of February 1287]]. During a [[English Channel naval campaign, 1338-1339|naval campaign of 1339]], and again in 1377, the town was raided and burnt by the French, and seems then to have gone into a decline. As a port, Hastings' days were finished.\n\n[[File:Hastings town centre postcard.jpg|thumb|left|Hastings town centre and the Memorial from an old postcard]]\nHastings had suffered over the years from the lack of a natural harbour, and there have been attempts to create a sheltered harbour. Attempts were made to build a stone harbour during the reign of [[Elizabeth I]], but the foundations were destroyed by the sea in terrible storms. The fishing boats are still stored on and launched from the beach.\n\nHastings was then just a small fishing settlement, but it was soon discovered that the new taxes on luxury goods could be made profitable by smuggling; the town was ideally located for that purpose.<ref name=\"Smuggling on the Sussex Coast\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hmag.org.uk/LocalHistory/ |title=Hastings Museum |publisher=Smuggling on the Sussex Coast |accessdate=10 February 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318003820/http://www.hmag.org.uk/LocalHistory/ |archivedate=18 March 2009 }}</ref> Near the castle ruins, on the West Hill, are \"[[St Clement's Caves]]\", partly natural, but mainly excavated by hand by smugglers from the soft sandstone. Their trade was to come to an end with the period following the [[Napoleonic Wars]], for the town became one of the most fashionable resorts in Britain, brought about by the so-called health-giving properties of seawater, as well as the local springs and Roman baths. Once this came about the expansion of the town took place, to the west, since there was little space left in the valley.\n\n[[File:Bottle Alley Hastings.jpg|thumb|right|The double decker promenade that runs from Hastings Pier beyond Marine Court (seen in the distance), with a break at Warrior Square, was built in the 1930s by the borough engineer [[Sidney Little]]]]\nIt was at this time that the elegant Pelham Crescent and Wellington Square were built: other building followed. In the Crescent (designed by architect [[Joseph Kay (architect)|Joseph Kay]]) is the classical style church of St Mary in the Castle (its name recalling the old chapel in the castle above) now in use as an arts centre. The building of the crescent and the church necessitated further cutting away of the castle hill cliffs. Once that move away from the old town had begun, it led to the further expansion along the coast, eventually linking up with the new [[St Leonards-on-Sea|St Leonards]].\n\nThe extensive development meant that a large transient work-force was required. Many of the people coming in to Hastings at this time, settled on some waste-ground to the west of the main town called the [[America Ground]]. This land, originally a shingle spit created by the great storm of 1287, was declared to be Crown Property after an inquiry held at [[Battle]] during 1827 and the land was cleared in preparation for the development of this area of land by [[Patrick Francis Robertson]].<ref>[http://wiki.historymap.info/Category:America_Ground Hastings local history Wiki]</ref>\n\n{{main|Hastings Old Town}}\n\n[[File:Historische Altstadt-Hastings.JPG|thumb|left|George Street, Old town]]\nLike many coastal towns, the population of Hastings grew significantly as a result of the construction of railway links and the fashionable growth of seaside holidays during the [[Victorian era]]. In 1801, its population was a mere 3,175; by 1831, it had reached over ten thousand; by 1891, it was almost sixty thousand.\n\nThe last harbour project began in 1896, but this also failed when structural problems and rising costs exhausted all the available funds. Today a fractured seawall is all that remains of what might have become a magnificent harbour. In 1897, the foundation stone was laid on a large concrete structure, but there was insufficient money to complete the work and the \"Harbour arm\" remains uncompleted. It was later partially blown up to discourage possible use by German invasion forces during World War II.\n\nBetween 1903 and 1919 Fred Judge FRPS photographed many of the towns events and disasters.  These included storms, the first tram, visit of the Lord Mayor of London, Hastings Marathon Race and the pier fire of 1917. Many of these images were produced as picture postcards by the British Postcard manufacturer he founded now known as [[Judges Postcards]].\n\nIn the 1930s, the town underwent some rejuvenation. Seaside resorts were starting to go out of fashion: Hastings perhaps more than most. The town council set about a huge rebuilding project, among which the promenade was rebuilt, and an Olympic-size bathing pool was erected. The latter, regarded in its day as one of the best open-air swimming and diving complexes in Europe, later became a holiday camp before closing in 1986. It was demolished, but the area is still known by locals as \"The Old Bathing Pool\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seasidehistory.co.uk/hastings_lido.html|title=The Bathing Pool at Hastings and St Leonards|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517053426/http://seasidehistory.co.uk/hastings_lido.html|archivedate=17 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n[[File:Hastings Old Town July 1965.jpg|thumb|Hastings Old Town July 1965.]]\nThe 2001 census reported over 85,000 inhabitants.\n\n==Governance==\n[[File:EastSussexHastings.png|thumb|right|Borough of Hastings, shown within East Sussex]]\n\n{{details|Hastings and Rye (UK Parliament constituency)}}\nHastings returned two [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] from the 14th century until 1885, since when it has returned one. Since 1983, it has been part of the  [[Hastings and Rye (UK Parliament constituency)|parliamentary constituency of Hastings and Rye]]; the current MP, since [[2019 United Kingdom general election|December 2019]], is [[Sally-Ann Hart]] of the Conservative Party. Prior to 1983, the town formed  the [[Hastings (UK Parliament constituency)|Hastings parliamentary constituency]] by itself.\n\nHastings, it is thought, was a Saxon town before the arrival of the Normans: the [[Domesday Book]] refers to a ''new Borough'': as a borough, Hastings had a [[corporation]] consisting of a \"bailiff, jurats, and commonalty\".<ref name=\"Hastings Past\"/> Its importance was such that it also gave its name to one of the six [[Rape (county subdivision)|Rapes]] or administrative districts of Sussex.\n\n[[File:Hastings Town Hall - geograph.org.uk - 1197481.jpg|thumb|left|Hastings Town Hall]]\nBy a Charter of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in 1589 the bailiff was replaced by a mayor, by which time the town's importance was dwindling. In the [[Georgian era]], patronage of such seaside places (such as nearby [[Brighton]]) gave it a new lease of life so that, when the time came with the reform of English local government in 1888, Hastings became a [[County Borough]], responsible for all its local services, independent of the surrounding county, then Sussex (East); less than one hundred years later, [[Local Government Act 1972|in 1974]], that status was abolished.\n\nHastings Borough Council is now in the second tier of local government, below [[East Sussex County Council]]. The Labour Party has an overall control of the council with 23 seats, whilst the Conservative Party holds 9 seats and one is held by an independent. The Borough is divided into sixteen [[Wards of the United Kingdom|electoral wards]]; Ashdown, Baird, Braybrooke, Castle, Central [[St Leonards-on-Sea|St Leonards]], Conquest, Gensing, [[Hollington, East Sussex|Hollington]], Maze Hill, [[Hastings Old Town|Old Hastings]], [[Ore, East Sussex|Ore]], St Helens, [[Silverhill, Hastings|Silverhill]], Tressell, [[West St Leonards]] and Wishing Tree.<ref name=\"Wards\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hastings.gov.uk/wards/default.aspx |title=Map of ward boundaries |publisher=Hastings Online |accessdate=17 February 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223155044/http://hastings.gov.uk/wards/default.aspx |archivedate=23 February 2009 }}</ref> The council leader is Peter Chowney, who stood against Sally-Ann Hart as the Labour candidate in the 2019 General Election .<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000735 |title=Hastings election result: Conservatives hold onto Hastings and Rye with significantly increased majority of 4043|}}</ref>\n\n==Geography and climate==\n[[File:East Cliff Lift Re-opening - geograph.org.uk - 1773330.jpg|thumb|left|The East Hill Cliff]]\n[[File:Hastings East Cliff.jpg|thumb|right|East Cliff at Hastings]]\nHastings is situated where the [[sandstone]] beds, at the heart of the [[Weald]], known geologically as the Hastings Sands, meet the [[English Channel]], forming tall cliffs to the east of the town. [[Hastings Old Town]] is in a sheltered valley between the East Hill and West Hill (on which the remains of the Castle stand). In Victorian times and later the town has spread westwards and northwards, and now forms a single urban centre with the more suburban area of [[St Leonards-on-Sea]] to the west. Roads from the Old Town valley lead towards the Victorian area of Clive Vale and the former village of [[Ore, Sussex|Ore]], from which \"The Ridge\", marking the effective boundary of Hastings, extends north-westwards towards [[Battle, East Sussex|Battle]]. Beyond [[Bulverhythe]], the western end of Hastings is marked by low-lying land known as [[Glyne Gap]], separating it from [[Bexhill-on-Sea]].\n\nThe sandstone cliffs have been the subject of considerable erosion in relatively recent times: much of the Castle was lost to the sea before the present sea defences and promenade were built, and a number of cliff-top houses are in danger of disappearing around the nearby village of [[Fairlight, East Sussex|Fairlight]].\n\nThe beach is mainly shingle, although wide areas of sand are uncovered at low tide. The town is generally built upon a series of low hills rising to {{convert|500|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] at \"The Ridge\" before falling back in the river valley further to the north.\n\n[[File:Fossilised dinosaur footprint fairlght cliffs 2007.JPG|thumb|right|Dinosaur footprint found amongst rocks at the cliff base]]\nThere are three [[Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] within the borough; [[Marline Valley Woods]], [[Combe Haven]] and [[Hastings Country Park|Hastings Cliffs To Pett Beach]].

Redevelopment of the area is partly hampered by the split administration of the combined Hastings and Bexhill economic region between Hastings and [[Rother District|Rother]] district councils. There is little space for further large-scale housing and employment growth within the designated boundaries of Hastings, and development on the outskirts is resisted by Rother council whose administrative area surrounds Hastings.

{"title_page": "Buffer solution", "text_new": "{{short description|Aqueous solution consisting of a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base, which resists pH change when a strong acid or base is added}}\n{{Acids and bases}}A '''buffer solution''' (more precisely, [[pH]] buffer or [[hydrogen ion]] buffer) is an [[aqueous solution]] consisting of a [[mixture]] of a [[weak acid]] and its [[conjugate base]], or vice versa. Its pH changes very little when a small amount of [[strong acid]] or [[Base (chemistry)#Strong bases|base]] is added to it. Buffer solutions are used as a means of keeping pH at a nearly constant value in a wide variety of chemical applications. In nature, there are many systems that use buffering for pH regulation. For example, the [[bicarbonate buffering system]] is used to regulate the pH of [[blood]].\n\n==Principles of buffering==\n\n[[File:Buffer titration graph.svg|thumb|250px|right|Simulated [[titration]] of an acidified solution of a weak acid (p''K''<sub>a</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;4.7) with alkali]]\nBuffer solutions achieve their resistance to pH change because of the presence of an equilibrium between the weak acid HA and its conjugate base A<sup>\u2212</sup>:\n: HA {{eqm}} H<sup>+</sup> + A<sup>\u2212</sup>\nWhen some [[strong acid]] is added to an equilibrium mixture of the weak acid and its [[conjugate base]], hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>) are added, and the equilibrium is shifted to the left, in accordance with [[Le Ch\u00e2telier's principle]]. Because of this, the hydrogen ion concentration increases by less than the amount expected for the quantity of strong acid added.\nSimilarly, if strong alkali is added to the mixture, the hydrogen ion concentration decreases by less than the amount expected for the quantity of alkali added. The effect is illustrated by the simulated titration of a weak acid with [[Acid dissociation constant|p''K''<sub>a</sub>]]&nbsp;=&nbsp;4.7. The relative concentration of undissociated acid is shown in blue, and of its conjugate base in red. The pH changes relatively slowly in the buffer region, pH&nbsp;=&nbsp;p''K''<sub>a</sub>&nbsp;\u00b1&nbsp;1, centered at pH&nbsp;=&nbsp;4.7, where [HA]&nbsp;=&nbsp;[A<sup>\u2212</sup>]. The hydrogen ion concentration decreases by less than the amount expected because most of the added hydroxide ion is consumed in the reaction\n: OH<sup>\u2212</sup> + HA \u2192 H<sub>2</sub>O + A<sup>\u2212</sup>\nand only a little is consumed in the neutralization reaction (which is the reaction that results in an increase in pH)\n: OH<sup>\u2212</sup> + H<sup>+</sup> \u2192 H<sub>2</sub>O.\n\nOnce the acid is more than 95% [[Deprotonation|deprotonated]], the pH rises rapidly because most of the added alkali is consumed in the neutralization reaction.\n\n===Buffer capacity===\nBuffer capacity is a quantitative measure of the resistance to change of pH of a solution containing a buffering agent with respect to a change of acid or alkali concentration. It can be defined as follows:<ref name=Skoog/><ref name=Urbansky/>\n: <math>\\beta = \\frac{dC_b}{d(\\mathrm{pH})},</math>   \nwhere <math>dC_b</math> is an infinitesimal amount of added base, or\n: <math>\\beta = -\\frac{dC_a}{d(\\mathrm{pH})},</math> \nwhere <math>dC_a</math> is an infinitesimal amount of added acid. pH is defined as \u2212log<sub>10</sub>[H<sup>+</sup>], and ''d''(pH) is an infinitesimal change in pH. \n\nWith either definition the buffer capacity for a weak acid HA with dissociation constant ''K''<sub>a</sub> can be expressed as<ref>{{cite book |last1=Butler |first1=J.

Note that in solution H<sup>+</sup> exists as the [[hydronium]] ion H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>, and further [[aquation]] of the hydronium ion has negligible effect on the dissociation equilibrium, except at very high acid concentration. \n\n[[File:Buffer Capacity 2.png|thumb|250px|Buffer capacity ''\u03b2'' for a 0.1&nbsp;M solution of a weak acid with a p''K''<sub>a</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;7]]\nThis equation shows that there are three regions of raised buffer capacity (see figure).\n* In the central region of the curve (coloured green on the plot), the second term is dominant, and\n:: <math chem>\\beta \\approx 2.303 \\frac{T_\\ce{HA} K_a[\\ce{H+}]}{(K_a + [\\ce{H+}])^2}.</math>   \n: Buffer capacity rises to a local maximum at pH&nbsp;=&nbsp;''pK''<sub>a</sub>.

Buffer capacity is negligible when the concentration [HA] of buffering agent is very small and increases with increasing concentration of the buffering agent.<ref name=Urbansky/> Some authors show only this region in graphs of buffer capacity.<ref name=Skoog/>\n: Buffer capacity falls to 33% of the maximum value at {{nobr|pH {{=}} p''K''<sub>a</sub> \u00b1 1}}, to 10% at {{nobr|pH = p''K''<sub>a</sub> \u00b1 1.5}} and to 1% at {{nobr|pH {{=}} p''K''<sub>a</sub> \u00b1 2}}. For this reason the most useful range is approximately p''K''<sub>a</sub>&nbsp;\u00b1&nbsp;1. When choosing a buffer for use at a specific pH, it should have a p''K''<sub>a</sub> value as close as possible to that pH.<ref name=Skoog>{{cite book |last1=Skoog |first1=Douglas A. |last2=West |first2=Donald M. |last3=Holler |first3=F.

This term is independent of the presence or absence of a buffering agent.\n* With strongly alkaline solutions, pH more than about 12 (coloured blue on the plot), the third term in the equation dominates, and buffer capacity rises exponentially with increasing pH:\n:: <math>\\beta \\approx 10^{\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_\\text{w}}.</math>\n: This results from the fact that the first and second terms become negligible at very high pH. This term is also independent of the presence or absence of a buffering agent.\n\n==Applications==\nThe pH of a solution containing a buffering agent can only vary within a narrow range, regardless of what else may be present in the solution. In biological systems this is an essential condition for [[enzyme]]s to function correctly. For example, in [[Blood|human blood]] a mixture of [[carbonic acid]] (H{{su|b=2}}CO{{su|b=3}}) and [[bicarbonate]] (HCO{{su|b=3|p=\u2212}}) is present in the [[blood plasma|plasma]] fraction;  this constitutes the major mechanism for maintaining the pH of blood between 7.35 and 7.45. Outside this narrow range (7.40 \u00b1 0.05 pH unit), [[acidosis]] and [[alkalosis]] metabolic conditions rapidly develop, ultimately leading to death if the correct buffering capacity is not rapidly restored. \n\nIf the pH value of a solution rises or falls too much, the effectiveness of an enzyme decreases in a process, known as [[denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]], which is usually irreversible.<ref name=\"Scorpio 2000\">{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of Acids, Bases, Buffers & Their Application to Biochemical Systems |last=Scorpio |first=R. |year=2000 |publisher= |isbn=978-0-7872-7374-3}}</ref> The majority of biological samples that are used in research are kept in a buffer solution, often [[phosphate buffered saline]] (PBS) at pH&nbsp;7.4.\n\nIn industry, buffering agents are used in [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] processes and in setting the correct conditions for dyes used in colouring fabrics.

For alkaline buffers, a strong base such as [[sodium hydroxide]] may be added. Alternatively, a buffer mixture can be made from a mixture of an acid and its conjugate base. For example, an acetate buffer can be made from a mixture of acetic acid and [[sodium acetate]]. Similarly, an alkaline buffer can be made from a mixture of the base and its conjugate acid.\n\n===\"Universal\" buffer mixtures===\nBy combining substances with p''K''<sub>a</sub> values differing by only two or less and adjusting the pH, a wide range of buffers can be obtained. [[Citric acid]] is a useful component of a buffer mixture because it has three p''K''<sub>a</sub> values, separated by less than two.

In biological systems this is an essential condition for [[enzyme]]s to function correctly. For example, in [[Blood|human blood]] a mixture of [[carbonic acid]] (H{{su|b=2}}CO{{su|b=3}}) and [[bicarbonate]] (HCO{{su|b=3|p=\u2212}}) is present in the [[blood plasma|plasma]] fraction;  this constitutes the major mechanism for maintaining the pH of blood between 7.35 and 7.45. Outside this narrow range (7.40 \u00b1 0.05 pH unit), [[acidosis]] and [[alkalosis]] metabolic conditions rapidly develop, ultimately leading to death if the correct buffering capacity is not rapidly restored. \n\nIf the pH value of a solution rises or falls too much, the effectiveness of an enzyme decreases in a process, known as [[denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]], which is usually irreversible.<ref name=\"Scorpio 2000\">{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of Acids, Bases, Buffers & Their Application to Biochemical Systems |last=Scorpio |first=R. |year=2000 |publisher= |isbn=978-0-7872-7374-3}}</ref> The majority of biological samples that are used in research are kept in a buffer solution, often [[phosphate buffered saline]] (PBS) at pH&nbsp;7.4.\n\nIn industry, buffering agents are used in [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] processes and in setting the correct conditions for dyes used in colouring fabrics.

For alkaline buffers, a strong base such as [[sodium hydroxide]] may be added. Alternatively, a buffer mixture can be made from a mixture of an acid and its conjugate base. For example, an acetate buffer can be made from a mixture of acetic acid and [[sodium acetate]]. Similarly, an alkaline buffer can be made from a mixture of the base and its conjugate acid.\n\n===\"Universal\" buffer mixtures===\nBy combining substances with p''K''<sub>a</sub> values differing by only two or less and adjusting the pH, a wide range of buffers can be obtained. [[Citric acid]] is a useful component of a buffer mixture because it has three p''K''<sub>a</sub> values, separated by less than two. The buffer range can be extended by adding other buffering agents.

If strong alkali, such as sodium hydroxide, is added, then ''y'' will have a negative sign because alkali removes hydrogen ions from the solution. The second row, labelled '''C''' for \"change\", specifies the changes that occur when the acid dissociates. The acid concentration decreases by an amount \u2212''x'', and the concentrations of A<sup>\u2212</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> both increase by an amount +''x''. This follows from the equilibrium expression. The third row, labelled '''E''' for \"equilibrium\", adds together the first two rows and shows the concentrations at equilibrium.\n\nTo find ''x'', use the formula for the equilibrium constant in terms of concentrations:\n: <math chem>K_\\text{a} = \\frac{[\\ce{H+}] [\\ce{A-}]}{[\\ce{HA}]}.</math>\n\nSubstitute the concentrations with the values found in the last row of the ICE table:\n: <math>K_\\text{a} = \\frac{x(x + y)}{C_0 - x}.</math>\n\nSimplify to\n: <math>x^2 + (K_\\text{a} + y) x - K_\\text{a} C_0 = 0.</math>\n\nWith specific values for ''C''<sub>0</sub>, ''K''<sub>a</sub> and ''y'', this equation can be solved for ''x''.

Below the lowest p K A, the triply protonated species prevails; between the lowest and middle p K A, the doubly protonated form prevails; between the middle and highest p K A, the singly protonated form prevails; and above the highest p K A, the unprotonated form of citric acid is predominant.| [[Determination of equilibrium constants#speciation calculations|% species formation]] calculated for a 10-millimolar solution of citric acid]]\n\nPolyprotic acids are acids that can lose more than one proton. The constant for dissociation of the first proton may be denoted as ''K''<sub>a1</sub>, and the constants for dissociation of successive protons as ''K''<sub>a2</sub>, etc. [[Citric acid]] is an example of a polyprotic acid H<sub>3</sub>A, as it can lose three protons.\n: {| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

In the case of citric acid, the overlap is extensive and solutions of citric acid are buffered over the whole range of pH&nbsp;2.5 to 7.5.\n\nCalculation of the pH with a polyprotic acid requires a [[Determination of equilibrium constants#Speciation calculations|speciation calculation]] to be performed.

Miffonis specialized in the construction of [[lighthouse|lighthouses]]. He studied in civil engineering at the [[University of Paris]]. In 1905, after obtaining his diploma, he accepted an offer of employment with the [[Fisheries and Oceans Canada|Department of Fisheries and Oceans]] in Canada for work with the ''Commission des phares'' (Commission of Lighthouses), newly created. Miffonis' work was supervised by the Chief Engineer of the Commission, [[William P. Anderson|William Patrick Anderson]], a fervent promoter of [[reinforced concrete]] in the construction of lighthouses.\n\nThe recruitment of Miffonis, for his competence in the use of concrete, corresponded with an intense period of maritime infrastructure construction in Canada, and in particular, the construction of lighthouses. During the first three years of the Commission, Miffonis developed and patented in 1908 plans for the design of tapered reinforced concrete lighthouses with [[flying buttresses]]. \n\nThe importance of Miffonis' role in the construction of Canadian lighthouses between 1908 and 1913 was underestimated until the rediscovery of his correspondence with Anderson. In 1913, Miffonis published a work presenting calculations showing the use of reinforced concrete and its advantages in the construction of lighthouses.\n\nAt then end of the [[First World War]], there was little construction of new lighthouses and Miffonis ended his career with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. \n\n== Biography ==\n=== Education and arrival in Canada ===\nHenri de Miffonis was born in France in 1882.<ref name=\"BVp54\">{{cite book|author1=Brigitte Violette|author2=L\u00e9\u00efc Godbout|title=La station d'aide \u00e0 la navigation de Pointe-au-P\u00e8re et son phare de b\u00e9ton arm\u00e9 : centenaire d'une construction audacieuse, 1909-2009|location=Qu\u00e9bec|publisher=Parcs Canada|date=2009|pp=54-55|isbn=9781100920429}}</ref> He received his education at the University of Paris during a time when reinforced concrete was revolutionizing the building industry in France and was considered the leading edge in its use as a new material.<ref name=\"BVp54\"/> Miffonis was profoundly influenced by this assessment and the use of reinforced concrete was a key element of his career.<ref name=\"BVp54\"/>\n\nIn 1905, Henri de Miffonis joined the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans as an engineer for the ''Commission des phares'' (Commission of Lighthouses).<ref name=\"BVp52\"/> This commission was created in February 1904 to respond to pressure from shipowners asking the Canadian authorities to aid in navigation along the Canadian coasts.<ref name=\"BVp19\">{{cite book|author1=Brigitte Violette|author2=L\u00e9\u00efc Godbout|title=La station d'aide \u00e0 la navigation de Pointe-au-P\u00e8re et son phare de b\u00e9ton arm\u00e9 : centenaire d'une construction audacieuse, 1909-2009|location=Qu\u00e9bec|publisher=Parcs Canada|date=2009|pp=19-20|isbn=9781100920429}}</ref><ref name=\"GCC\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ccg-gcc.gc.ca/fra/GCC/USQUE_Commission_phares |title=Historique de la Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re canadienne et des Services de la Marine - La Commission des phares |website=www.gcc-ccg.gc.ca|author=Thomas E.

The Assistant Chief Engineer, B. H. Fraser, mentioned that Miffonis was an educated man, possessing a grand culture and a great knowledge of [[mathematics]] and [[mechanics]] and one of the best theorists of the Department.<ref name=\"BVp54\"/> All of these qualities, as well as the needs of the ''Commission des phares'', result in Miffonis being assigned to the head office of the commission in [[Ottawa]] rather than one of the regional offices.<ref name=BVp54/> The hiring of the French engineer reassured the Department of Fisheries and Oceans about the use of reinforced concrete as a material for the construction of the new lighthouses erected at the beginning of the 20th century.<ref name=BVp52/>\n\n=== Career at the Commission de phares ===\nThe arrival of Miffonis corresponded to a prosperous period of construction of reinforced concrete lighthouses in Canada.<ref name=\"BVp52\"/>\n\nThe initial forecast of the ''Commission de phares'' noted that fourteen towers had be constructed of reinforced concrete, but in the end, more than twenty-five lighthouses were constructed with the material between 1906 and 1914.<ref name=\"BVp54\"/> The first five reinforced concrete lighthouses were built by the Steel Concrete Company of [[Montr\u00e9al]] between 1906 and 1908, the company chosen because they posessed a great deal of expertise using concrete.

Miffonis specialized in the construction of [[lighthouse|lighthouses]]. He studied in civil engineering at the [[University of Paris]]. In 1905, after obtaining his diploma, he accepted an offer of employment with the [[Fisheries and Oceans Canada|Department of Fisheries and Oceans]] in Canada for work with the ''Commission des phares'' (Commission of Lighthouses), newly created. Miffonis' work was supervised by the Chief Engineer of the Commission, [[William P. Anderson|William Patrick Anderson]], a fervent promoter of [[reinforced concrete]] in the construction of lighthouses.\n\nThe recruitment of Miffonis, for his competence in the use of concrete, corresponded with an intense period of maritime infrastructure construction in Canada, and in particular, the construction of lighthouses. During the first three years of the Commission, Miffonis developed and patented in 1908 plans for the design of tapered reinforced concrete lighthouses with [[flying buttresses]]. \n\nThe importance of Miffonis' role in the construction of Canadian lighthouses between 1908 and 1913 was underestimated until the rediscovery of his correspondence with Anderson. In 1913, Miffonis published a work presenting calculations showing the use of reinforced concrete and its advantages in the construction of lighthouses.\n\nAt then end of the [[First World War]], there was little construction of new lighthouses and Miffonis ended his career with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. \n\n== Biography ==\n=== Education and arrival in Canada ===\nHenri de Miffonis was born in France in 1882.<ref name=\"BVp54\">{{cite book|author1=Brigitte Violette|author2=L\u00e9\u00efc Godbout|title=La station d'aide \u00e0 la navigation de Pointe-au-P\u00e8re et son phare de b\u00e9ton arm\u00e9 : centenaire d'une construction audacieuse, 1909-2009|location=Qu\u00e9bec|publisher=Parcs Canada|date=2009|pp=54-55|isbn=9781100920429}}</ref> He received his education at the University of Paris during a time when reinforced concrete was revolutionizing the building industry in France and was considered the leading edge in its use as a new material.<ref name=\"BVp54\"/> Miffonis was profoundly influenced by this assessment and the use of reinforced concrete was a key element of his career.<ref name=\"BVp54\"/>\n\nIn 1905, Henri de Miffonis joined the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans as an engineer for the ''Commission des phares'' (Commission of Lighthouses).<ref name=\"BVp52\"/> This commission was created in February 1904 to respond to pressure from shipowners asking the Canadian authorities to aid in navigation along the Canadian coasts.<ref name=\"BVp19\">{{cite book|author1=Brigitte Violette|author2=L\u00e9\u00efc Godbout|title=La station d'aide \u00e0 la navigation de Pointe-au-P\u00e8re et son phare de b\u00e9ton arm\u00e9 : centenaire d'une construction audacieuse, 1909-2009|location=Qu\u00e9bec|publisher=Parcs Canada|date=2009|pp=19-20|isbn=9781100920429}}</ref><ref name=\"GCC\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ccg-gcc.gc.ca/fra/GCC/USQUE_Commission_phares |title=Historique de la Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re canadienne et des Services de la Marine - La Commission des phares |website=www.gcc-ccg.gc.ca|author=Thomas E.

The engines were mid-mounted in the chassis, and the cylinders were horizontal.  Drive was to the rear wheels via a 4-speed gearbox and chain. The gearbox is in 2 parts, linked by a connecting rod, the left one containing 2nd and 4th gear, and the right 1st, 3rd and reverse.\n\nThe 2-cylinder engine is rated at 9 HP, and is just over 2.5 liters in size. A [[total-loss oiling system]] is used on the car, lubricating 6 main oil-ways. James & Browne also launched a 4-cylinder version (16 HP), of a similar design to the horizontal 2-cylinder engine.\n\nIn 1906 a vertical-engined car was introduced known as the Vertex and available as either a 20&nbsp;hp four or 30/40&nbsp;hp six-cylinder.\n\n== Surviving cars ==\nOnly two of their cars are known to have survived, one built in 1902 and the other in 1904.\n\n===1902 model===\nThe car was built in 1902 and transported by train from the James and Browne works in [[Hammersmith, London]] to Albrighton Station, [[Shropshire]]. The first owner was Mr. Norman McLean of The Blue House, [[Tong, Shropshire]]. Mr Mclean had the car painted in the colours of his stables which were yellow with black lining. The car was then moved to [[Tong Castle]], the home of Miss Hartley, his future wife. The Hartley family had leased [[Tong Castle]] from Lord Bradford since 1855. Miss Hartley\u2019s brother was [[John Hartley (tennis)]], the winner of the Wimbledon Gentlemen\u2019s Singles Championship in 1879 and 1880.\n\nMr. McLean decided that some alterations to the car were required and instructed Mr. Ernest Roy Spencer to carry out the work. The Spencers were blacksmiths and ran their business at 15 Broadway, [[Shifnal]],<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Watts |editor-first=Sylvia |title=Shifnal, A Pictorial History |year=1989 |publisher= |isbn=0-85033-686-4}}</ref> around three miles from [[Tong Castle]]. \n\nIn 1910 Mr. McLean decided that he no longer had a use for the car and virtually gave it to Ernest Spencer for a nominal sum of \u00a320. The car was moved to Ernest Spencer\u2019s business premises. Mr. Spencer decided that Mr. Mclean\u2019s colour scheme was too conspicuous for general use and drinking trips, so decided to paint the car battleship grey with black piping. Mr. Spencer intended to convert the car to a pick-up truck for his business and fitted it with magneto ignition and a windscreen. However, with the outbreak of [[World War 1]] in Summer 1914, the car was mothballed and stored in a shed at the back of the premises and stayed there until 1929. \n\nIn 1929 it was decided to enter the car in the Old Crocks' Run to Brighton. The less permanent alterations to the car were removed and it was returned to as near original condition as possible. The car was entered in the Old Crocks' Run to Brighton on Sunday 20th October (entry number 25) and departed from the Mall at around 9am. The ambitious cargo for the journey to Brighton consisted of five passengers, their luggage and a quantity of beer. The car had a good run but lost time when the battery terminals shook loose, and was the fifth car to arrive in Brighton.\n\nIn December 1929, ownership of the car passed to Mr. Herbert Ford who purchased the car from the Spencers for the sum of \u00a335. Mr. Ford was a local man and shrewd businessman, and had owned nearby [[Lilleshall Hall]] since 1927. In 1930, Mr. Ford opened some pleasure gardens for the public at [[Lilleshall Hall]], and these included an amusement park, narrow gauge railway and children's playgrounds. The car was used as an attraction in the amusement park. Mr. Ford and his friend, Mr. T.R. Price, entered the car in the 1933 Old Crocks' Run on Sunday 12th November 1933. The car (entry number 21) completed the run successfully with an average speed of 19.61 mph. \n\nIn October 1934, the car was purchased by John Garland and Dick Riddle, two students at the City and Guilds College, part of [[Imperial College London]]. The car has been an active part of college life from 1934 to the present day. The car is still maintained by students and is driven in many events including the [[London to Brighton Veteran Car Run]].\n\n===1904 model===\nThe first owner of the 1904 car was The Reverend Dr. John Darlington, the vicar of St Mark's Church, [[Kennington]] in London, who also owned a house in [[Curry Rivel]], near [[Taunton]] in Somerset. The Reverend had originally owned a Peugeot which had badly let him down in 1905, and as a friend of his had a reliable two-cylinder James & Browne car he visited the Showroom in Oxford Street and asked to buy a car \"like the one my friend owns\".  Browne remembered this visit as he had to advise Darlington that the Company had ceased making two-cylinder models in 1904, but he could offer Darlington a new four-cylinder 1905 model. Darlington was adamant that he wanted a two-cylinder car, so it was arranged that an unused two-cylinder engine, gearbox and transmission from the workshop be fitted into a compatible spare chassis, but with a later model body designed for the four-cylinder car.\n\nErnest Proctor, who was employed at the Westcroft Works, was given the job of assembling this hybrid car, which comprised a very early two-cylinder engine - number 30 - of 1901 or 1902 vintage, a 1904 chassis - number 126, and a body destined for four-cylinder car number 156.\n\nTechnical data:\n:Engine: No.30. Twin-cylinder horizontal, each cylinder 4\" dia. x 6\" stroke. Inlet valves suction operated: exhaust valves mechanically operated. Water-cooled, with no pump or cooling fan.\n:Ignition: 6 volt battery producing ignition via 2 trembler coils (originally also fitted with magneto with switching between trembler and magneto as required). Conventional spark plugs.\n:Lubrication: Drip feed from reservoir on dashboard via sight glasses to 6 oiling points on main bearings and pistons.\n:Gearboxes: Two boxes - one for 1st. 3rd. and reverse, the other for 2nd. and 4th. with a sliding shaft between the two. Lubrication by splash feed in each box.\n:Transmission: Main drive from engine to gear boxes via heavy steel spur gear into a mating 'Buffoline' rawhide gear attached to the flywheel on the crank shaft.\n:Final Drive: By two chains via a differential.\n:Brakes: Foot brake operates on transmission. Hand brake is a conventional drum brake on the rear wheels only.\n:Wheels/tires: Originally wooden wheels with solid tires, but these were changed in the early years to Sankey type metal wheels and fitted with balloon tires.\n:Lighting: Side and rear lamps - oil (paraffin). Headlamps acetylene - gas produced from carbide/water accumulator.\n\nThe car was first registered Y184 and was delivered to Darlington at Kennington Vicarage on 10 March 1906. It was used in London until it was driven to Curry Rivel on 23 April 1906 by Henry Lucas, a James & Browne salesman, who remained with the owner for some time after delivery, to teach him how to drive and maintain the vehicle.\n\nThe car was driven by Darlington, accompanied by his eldest son John, in 1913/1914, on a 2,000 mile tour of Europe. At the outbreak of World War 1, the car was taken back to Kennington where it remained until about 1925, when John Darlington Jr. \"got it going again\", and drove it back to Curry Rivel. By this time Dr. Darlington had purchased an Armstrong, so the James & Browne was stored in a barn. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWhen the James & Browne Company ceased trading, Henry Lucas (the salesman and chauffeur) with his colleague and friend Ernest Proctor were both made redundant. Lucas, with a partner John Drake, started a motor business in Egham, Surrey called the Egham Motor Company, and in 1914 asked Proctor to join them as Works Manager.\n\nWhile on holiday in Somerset in 1938, Lucas called at the house in Curry Rivel to see what had happened to the Darlington family; Dr. Darlington was still there and so was the James & Browne car..... in the barn. Dr. Darlington gave the car to Lucas who brought it back to Egham where he and Proctor restored it. It was then kept in the showroom of The Egham Motor Company for many years.\n\nHowever, when applying to register the car after its restoration, it was discovered that Dr. Darlington had transferred the original registration number, Y184, to his Armstrong, which was (and we believe, still is) on the road! \nSomerset County Council allocated the nearest unused number to the James & Browne ...Y182 - hence the temporary 2 was fixed over the 4 on the original number plates.\n\nAfter World War II the car was officially dated by the [[Veteran Car Club of Great Britain|Veteran Car Club]] as a 1904 model, and Lucas and Proctor entered it in the [[London to Brighton Veteran Car Run|London to Brighton Run]] in November 1948 - the first London to Brighton run for the car. Henry Lucas was driving and Ernest Proctor was passenger.\n\nProctor's eldest son, Sidney, joined his father and Henry on many of the early runs, until Ernest died in 1958.\nBy 1963, Lucas had become too infirm to continue to look after the car and, as he had no children, he sold the car to Sidney Proctor. On Sidney\u2019s death the car passed to his son. The car was in the Proctor family until it was auctioned in November 2007.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bonhams: 1904 James & Browne 9hp Twin Cylinder Rear Entrance Tonneau 126|url=https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/15346/lot/305/}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Stand 81, [[Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders|SMM&T]] 5th International Motor Exhibition February 1906==\n[[File:James & Browne car advertisement circa late 1906.png|thumb]]\nJames & Browne's display from the official catalogue:<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433112039171&view=1up&seq=9 The Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders]</ref>\n:16-HP 4-cylinder ''J & B'' chassis: 4 speeds, 1 reverse, fitted with patent motor starter.

The engines were mid-mounted in the chassis, and the cylinders were horizontal.  Drive was to the rear wheels via a 4-speed gearbox and chain. The gearbox is in 2 parts, linked by a connecting rod, the left one containing 2nd and 4th gear, and the right 1st, 3rd and reverse.\n\nThe 2-cylinder engine is rated at 9 HP, and is just over 2.5 liters in size. A [[total-loss oiling system]] is used on the car, lubricating 6 main oil-ways. James & Browne also launched a 4-cylinder version (16 HP), of a similar design to the horizontal 2-cylinder engine.\n\nIn 1906 a vertical-engined car was introduced known as the Vertex and available as either a 20&nbsp;hp four or 30/40&nbsp;hp six-cylinder.\n\n== Surviving cars ==\nOnly two of their cars are known to have survived, one built in 1902 and the other in 1904.\n\n===1902 model===\nThe car was built in 1902 and transported by train from the James and Browne works in [[Hammersmith, London]] to Albrighton Station, [[Shropshire]]. The first owner was Mr. Norman McLean of The Blue House, [[Tong, Shropshire]]. Mr Mclean had the car painted in the colours of his stables which were yellow with black lining. The car was then moved to [[Tong Castle]], the home of Miss Hartley, his future wife. The Hartley family had leased [[Tong Castle]] from Lord Bradford since 1855. Miss Hartley\u2019s brother was [[John Hartley (tennis)]], the winner of the Wimbledon Gentlemen\u2019s Singles Championship in 1879 and 1880.\n\nMr. McLean decided that some alterations to the car were required and instructed Mr. Ernest Roy Spencer to carry out the work. The Spencers were blacksmiths and ran their business at 15 Broadway, [[Shifnal]],<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Watts |editor-first=Sylvia |title=Shifnal, A Pictorial History |year=1989 |publisher= |isbn=0-85033-686-4}}</ref> around three miles from [[Tong Castle]]. \n\nIn 1910 Mr. McLean decided that he no longer had a use for the car and virtually gave it to Ernest Spencer for a nominal sum of \u00a320. The car was moved to Ernest Spencer\u2019s business premises. Mr. Spencer decided that Mr. Mclean\u2019s colour scheme was too conspicuous for general use and drinking trips, so decided to paint the car battleship grey with black piping. Mr. Spencer intended to convert the car to a pick-up truck for his business and fitted it with magneto ignition and a windscreen. However, with the outbreak of [[World War 1]] in Summer 1914, the car was mothballed and stored in a shed at the back of the premises and stayed there until 1929. \n\nIn 1929 it was decided to enter the car in the Old Crocks' Run to Brighton. The less permanent alterations to the car were removed and it was returned to as near original condition as possible. The car was entered in the Old Crocks' Run to Brighton on Sunday 20th October (entry number 25) and departed from the Mall at around 9am. The ambitious cargo for the journey to Brighton consisted of five passengers, their luggage and a quantity of beer. The car had a good run but lost time when the battery terminals shook loose, and was the fifth car to arrive in Brighton.\n\nIn December 1929, ownership of the car passed to Mr. Herbert Ford who purchased the car from the Spencers for the sum of \u00a335. Mr. Ford was a local man and shrewd businessman, and had owned nearby [[Lilleshall Hall]] since 1927. In 1930, Mr. Ford opened some pleasure gardens for the public at [[Lilleshall Hall]], and these included an amusement park, narrow gauge railway and children's playgrounds. The car was used as an attraction in the amusement park. Mr. Ford and his friend, Mr. T.R. Price, entered the car in the 1933 Old Crocks' Run on Sunday 12th November 1933. The car (entry number 21) completed the run successfully with an average speed of 19.61 mph. \n\nIn October 1934, the car was purchased by John Garland and Dick Riddle, two students at the City and Guilds College, part of [[Imperial College London]] The car has been an active part of college life from 1934 to the present day. The car is still maintained by students and is driven in many events including the [[London to Brighton Veteran Car Run]].\n\n===1904 model===\nThe first owner of the 1904 car was The Reverend Dr. John Darlington, the vicar of St Mark's Church, [[Kennington]] in London, who also owned a house in [[Curry Rivel]], near [[Taunton]] in Somerset. The Reverend had originally owned a Peugeot which had badly let him down in 1905, and as a friend of his had a reliable two-cylinder James & Browne car he visited the Showroom in Oxford Street and asked to buy a car \"like the one my friend owns\".  Browne remembered this visit as he had to advise Darlington that the Company had ceased making two-cylinder models in 1904, but he could offer Darlington a new four-cylinder 1905 model. Darlington was adamant that he wanted a two-cylinder car, so it was arranged that an unused two-cylinder engine, gearbox and transmission from the workshop be fitted into a compatible spare chassis, but with a later model body designed for the four-cylinder car.\n\nErnest Proctor, who was employed at the Westcroft Works, was given the job of assembling this hybrid car, which comprised a very early two-cylinder engine - number 30 - of 1901 or 1902 vintage, a 1904 chassis - number 126, and a body destined for four-cylinder car number 156.\n\nTechnical data:\n:Engine: No.30. Twin-cylinder horizontal, each cylinder 4\" dia. x 6\" stroke. Inlet valves suction operated: exhaust valves mechanically operated. Water-cooled, with no pump or cooling fan.\n:Ignition: 6 volt battery producing ignition via 2 trembler coils (originally also fitted with magneto with switching between trembler and magneto as required). Conventional spark plugs.\n:Lubrication: Drip feed from reservoir on dashboard via sight glasses to 6 oiling points on main bearings and pistons.\n:Gearboxes: Two boxes - one for 1st. 3rd. and reverse, the other for 2nd. and 4th. with a sliding shaft between the two. Lubrication by splash feed in each box.\n:Transmission: Main drive from engine to gear boxes via heavy steel spur gear into a mating 'Buffoline' rawhide gear attached to the flywheel on the crank shaft.\n:Final Drive: By two chains via a differential.\n:Brakes: Foot brake operates on transmission. Hand brake is a conventional drum brake on the rear wheels only.\n:Wheels/tires: Originally wooden wheels with solid tires, but these were changed in the early years to Sankey type metal wheels and fitted with balloon tires.\n:Lighting: Side and rear lamps - oil (paraffin). Headlamps acetylene - gas produced from carbide/water accumulator.\n\nThe car was first registered Y184 and was delivered to Darlington at Kennington Vicarage on 10 March 1906. It was used in London until it was driven to Curry Rivel on 23 April 1906 by Henry Lucas, a James & Browne salesman, who remained with the owner for some time after delivery, to teach him how to drive and maintain the vehicle.\n\nThe car was driven by Darlington, accompanied by his eldest son John, in 1913/1914, on a 2,000 mile tour of Europe.

In addition to creating more mobility within the costumes, Toybina described the season's style focus as \"more fashion-forward and modern\" compared to the superhero and experimental feel of the first and second seasons.

Before each performance, a video package will tease clues to their identity with the celebrity narrating aspects of their biography in a disguised voice. After each performs in their own voice, the panelists will attempt to guess who is the masked singer. The contestants are then voted on by the audience to see who is safe and continues, or who will compete in a further round of singing in that episode, and possibly elimination.\n\n==Production==\nThe third season featured 18 new costumes. In addition to creating more mobility within the costumes, Toybina described the season's style focus as \"more fashion-forward and modern\" compared to the superhero and experimental feel of the first and second seasons.

Further, passionate fans of the show had been able to work out identities of the singers from early clue packages, so more difficult clue packages were created for the celebrities in the season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/masked-singer-season-3-cast-contestants-clues-1203448727/|title=''The Masked Singer'' Season 3: New Changes, Tougher Clues and \u2018Big Names\u2019 in the Cast|first=Elizabeth|last=Wagmeister|date=December 19, 2019|access-date=February 20, 2020|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref>\n\n==Panelists and host==\n{{multiple image\n| total_width   = 420\n| align         = left\n| direction     = horizontal\n| header        = Season 3 panelists and host\n| image1        = Robin Thicke 2019 by Glenn Francis.jpg\n| caption1      = [[Robin Thicke]]\n| image2        = Jenny McCarthy at E3 2006.jpg\n| caption2      = [[Jenny McCarthy]]\n| image3        = Ken Jeong March 2015.jpg\n| caption3      = [[Ken Jeong]]\n| image4        = Nicole Scherzinger 2012.jpg\n| caption4      = [[Nicole Scherzinger]]\n| image5        = Nick Cannon by David Shankbone.jpg\n| caption5      = [[Nick Cannon]] \n}}\n\n[[Nick Cannon]], singer-songwriter [[Robin Thicke]], television personality [[Jenny McCarthy]], actor and comedian [[Ken Jeong]], and recording artist [[Nicole Scherzinger]] will return for their third season as host and panelists.<ref name=\"Season 3 EW\">{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/tv/2019/12/30/what-we-know-the-masked-singer-season-3/|title=What we know (so far) about ''The Masked Singer'' season 3: New costumes, 18 contestants, and more|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|author=Rachel Yang |date=December 30, 2019|access-date=December 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nGuest panelists included [[Jamie Foxx]] during the first episode, [[Jason Biggs]] in the second episode, [[Leah Remini]] in the third episode, [[Gabriel Iglesias]] in the fifth episode, season 1 winner, [[T-Pain]], in the sixth episode, [[Joel McHale]] in the eighth episode, [[Will Arnett]] in the ninth episode, [[Yvette Nicole Brown]] in the eleventh episode, [[Sharon Osbourne]] in the twelfth episode,<ref name=\"TFC E12\"/> and [[Gordon Ramsay]] in the thirteenth episode.<ref name=\"TFC E13\"/>\n\n==Format==\nDuring the first nine episodes, the 18 singers have been divided up into three groups: Group A, B, and C, with each group having a block of three episodes.
