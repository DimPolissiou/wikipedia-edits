Agne Wideheim [[Sweden]] 1918-2007.]]\nA '''tailor''' is a person who makes, repairs, or alters clothing professionally, especially suits and men's clothing.\n\nAlthough the term dates to the thirteenth century, ''tailor'' took on its modern sense in the late eighteenth century, and now refers to makers of men's and women's [[suit (clothing)|suits]], [[coat (clothing)|coat]]s, [[trousers]], and similar garments, usually of [[wool]], [[linen]], or [[silk]].\n\nThe term refers to a set of specific hand and machine sewing and pressing techniques that are unique to the construction of traditional jackets. Retailers of tailored suits often take their services internationally, traveling to various cities, allowing the client to be measured locally.\n\nTraditional tailoring is called \"[[bespoke tailoring]]\" in the United Kingdom, where the heart of the trade is London's [[Savile Row  tailoring]], and \"custom tailoring\" in the United States and [[Hong Kong]]. This is unlike [[made to measure]] which uses pre-existing patterns. A bespoke  garment or suit is completely original and unique to each customer.\n\nFamous fictional tailors include the tailor in ''[[The Tailor of Gloucester]]'', ''[[The Emperor's New Clothes]] '' and ''[[The Valiant Little Tailor]]''. A more recent example is [[John le Carr\u00e9]]'s ''[[The Tailor of Panama]]''.\n\n==Types==\n[[Image:A tailor fitting a customer (Belgrade, 1937).jpg|left|thumb|upright=.8|Fitting a customer]]\n[[Image:TailoringFirstFitFront01.jpg|right|thumb|Tailoring first fitting]]\nAs the tailoring profession has evolved, so too have the methods of tailoring. There are a number of distinctive business models which modern tailors may practice. While some may practice many, there are others who will practice only one or two.\n===Local tailoring===\nLocal tailoring is as the name implies. Typically the tailor is met locally and the garment produced locally. This method enables the tailor to take professional measurements, assess posture and body shape to make unique modifications to the garment. Local tailors will typically have a showroom or shopfront allowing clients to choose fabrics from samples or return the garment easily should it require further modification.  This is the most traditional form of tailoring. [[Hong Kong Tailors]] and London are the most famous for high quality [[bespoke]] tailoring, in average it takes about 2 to 3 fittings and about 50 to 70 working hours to handmake one suit.\n\n===Distance tailoring===\n[[File:House-of-dapper-nl.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Coat of arms|Coat of Arms]] of House of Dapper, a tailor based in [[Netherlands|The Netherlands]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.houseofdapper.nl|title=House of Dapper tailors|last=|first=|date=2019|website=House of Dapper|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>]]\n[[Image:John's.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Cloth merchant|Clothier]] and tailor in the [[Financial District, Boston, Massachusetts|Financial District]] of [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]]]]\nDistance tailoring involves ordering a garment from an out-of-town tailor enabling cheaper labour to be used. In practice this can now be done on a global scale via e-commerce websites. Unlike local tailoring, customers must take their own measurements, fabric selection must be made from a photo and if further alterations are required the garment must be shipped.  Today, the most common platform for distance tailoring is via online tailors.\n\nOnline tailors sometimes offer to pay for needed alterations at a local tailor.  Another new option is the concept where a free test suit is made to the provided measurements and shipped to the customer first.  The test suit can be tried on and worn to see where any adjustments are wanted.  The final suit is then tailored to the new specifications provided by the test suit fitting.\n\n===Traveling tailor===\nUnlike tailors who do distance tailoring, traveling tailors provide a more personal service to their customers and give the customers an opportunity to see the fabric samples and meet the tailor in person. Traveling tailors travel between cities and station in a local luxury hotel for a short period of time to meet and provide the same tailoring services they would provide in their local store. In the hotel, the customer will be able to select the fabric from samples and the tailor will take the measurements himself. The order then will be shipped to the customer within 3\u20134 weeks time. Unlike local tailoring, if further alterations are required the garment must be shipped. Today, most traveling tailors are from Hong Kong, traveling to the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Australia and Japan.\n\n==Related terms==\n[[File:Brownell's trouser button.jpg|upright|thumb|Vintage tailor's button from [[Hobart, Tasmania]]]]\n[[File:Zackenschere.jpg|thumb|[[Pinking shears]]]]\n* A ''tailor-made'' is a man's suit consisting of a (usually) [[woolen]] or [[tweed (cloth)|tweed]] [[coat (clothing)|coat]] and [[pants]]; the name arose during the [[Edwardian period]].\n* As an adjective, ''tailor-made'' (from the second half of the twentieth century usually simplified to ''tailored'') refers to [[clothing]] made by or in the style of clothes made by a tailor, characterized by simplicity of [[cut (clothing)|cut]] and [[trim (sewing)|trim]] and fine (often hand) finishing; as a women's clothing style ''tailored'' as opposed to [[dressmaker]].\n*''Rodeo tailor'' is a term for a creator of the flamboyant costumes typical of [[country music|country and western]] musicians, characterized by extensive hand [[embroidery]], an abundance of [[rhinestone]]s, and [[cowboy]] details such as [[pearl]] [[Snap fastener|snaps]] and [[western wear|arrowhead pockets]].\n* In some documents, tailor means ''adjust'', and tailoring means ''adjusting''.\n\n'''''Sewing professional''''' is the most general term for those who make their living by sewing, teaching, writing about sewing, or retailing sewing supplies.

Their album, ''[[Loaded Gun (album)|Loaded Gun]]'',  produced by Garth Richardson ([[Rage Against the Machine]]) and mixed by [[Bob Ezrin]] ([[Pink Floyd]]) was released in 2014.\n\n==History==\n===Gloryhound and the Skyhawks (2006-2007)===\nGloryhound was founded in 2006 by high school friends Evan Meisner, David Casey, Shaun Hanlon, Jeremy MacPherson, and [[Adam Baldwin (singer)|Adam Baldwin]] as an [[alternative country]] band named Gloryhound and the Skyhawks.

After releasing an eponymous album in 2007, Gloryhound and the Skyhawks decided to regroup as a hard rock act under a new name.\n\n===Name change and ''Leave it Alone'' (2008-March 2010)===\nIn 2008 the band condensed its name to Gloryhound, and began writing hard rock songs. Eschewing harmonicas and plaid shirts for guitarmonies and leather jackets, the name change also coincided with the amicable departure of [[Adam Baldwin (singer)|Adam Baldwin]]. The result of these writing sessions would be ''Leave it Alone'', the first album recorded under the name Gloryhound. Produced by Rob Crowell (''[[Deer Tick (band)|Deer Tick]]'') and recorded at the Sonic Temple in Halifax, Nova Scotia, ''Leave it Alone'' was released independently in December 2009. Subsequent touring throughout 2010 saw the group showcase at conferences such as [[Canadian Music Week]], Junofest in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador and [[NXNE]] for the first time. Gloryhound was accompanied to these conferences by friend and advisor Gordon Lapp. Following Gloryhound's Junofest performance, the band signed a booking deal with The Agency Group in March 2010 and formally brought Lapp on as band manager.\n\n===''Electric Dusk'' (April 2010 - Sept 2012)===\nIn the summer of 2010 Gloryhound temporarily relocated to Toronto, Ontario to begin working on new material. The result was ''[[Electric Dusk]]''. Recorded over two days at Chemical Sound Studios and produced by [[Laurence Currie]], ''Electric Dusk'' was released independently as a seven song  EP in December 2010.

The band is from [[Fall River, Nova Scotia]]. Gloryhound were signed by [[Entertainment One]] Canada in 2012. Their album, ''[[Loaded Gun (album)|Loaded Gun]]'',  produced by Garth Richardson ([[Rage Against the Machine]]) and mixed by [[Bob Ezrin]] ([[Pink Floyd]]) was released in 2014.\n\n==History==\n===Gloryhound and the Skyhawks (2006-2007)===\nGloryhound was founded in 2006 by high school friends Evan Meisner, David Casey, Shaun Hanlon, Jeremy MacPherson, and [[Adam Baldwin (singer)|Adam Baldwin]] as an [[alternative country]] band named Gloryhound and the Skyhawks. Described as \"a poor man's El Torpedo\",<ref>{{cite web|first = Ian|last = Finley |title = Stanfields and Gloryhound Heat Things up in Toronto | publisher = East Coast Connected |url= http://eastcoastconnected.ca/news/stanfields-and-gloryhound-heat-things-toronto|date= March 4, 2011 |accessdate= May 13, 2012}}</ref> the group enjoyed local success opening for the likes of [[Dutch Mason]], [[Matt Minglewood]], and [[Matt Mays]]. After releasing an eponymous album in 2007, Gloryhound and the Skyhawks decided to regroup as a hard rock act under a new name.\n\n===Name change and ''Leave it Alone'' (2008-March 2010)===\nIn 2008 the band condensed its name to Gloryhound, and began writing hard rock songs. Eshewing harmonicas and plaid shirts for guitarmonies and leather jackets, the name change also coincided with the amicable departure of [[Adam Baldwin (singer)|Adam Baldwin]]. The result of these writing sessions would be ''Leave it Alone'', the first album recorded under the name Gloryhound. Produced by Rob Crowell (''[[Deer Tick (band)|Deer Tick]]'') and recorded at the Sonic Temple in Halifax, Nova Scotia, ''Leave it Alone'' was released independently in December 2009. Subsequent touring throughout 2010 saw the group showcase at conferences such as [[Canadian Music Week]], Junofest in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador and [[NXNE]] for the first time. Gloryhound was accompanied to these conferences by friend and advisor Gordon Lapp. Following Gloryhound's Junofest performance, the band signed a booking deal with The Agency Group in March 2010 and formally brought Lapp on as band manager.\n\n===''Electric Dusk'' (April 2010 - Sept 2012)===\nIn the summer of 2010 Gloryhound temporarily relocated to Toronto, Ontario to begin working on new material. The result was ''[[Electric Dusk]]''. Recorded over two days at Chemical Sound Studios and produced by [[Laurence Currie]], ''Electric Dusk'' was released independently as a seven song  EP in December 2010. The title track, \"Electric Dusk\", was released as a single to Canadian Rock Radio by Spincount in September 2011. The song would  peak at No.&nbsp;14 on the Canadian Active Rock charts the following March.<ref>{{cite web|first= Andrew|last= Bonia | title = Canadian Active Rock & Alt Rock Chart Archive: Alternative Rock - March 20, 2012| publisher = America's Music Charts| url = http://canadianrockalt.blogspot.com/2011/12/active-rock-march-20-2012.html| accessdate = May 10, 2012}}</ref> During extensive touring, the band opened for [[Sam Roberts Band]], [[Drive By Truckers]], and as direct support for [[Thin Lizzy]] at the [[Sound Academy]] in Toronto on March 30, 2011.
