In that time period, 97 immigrants (7.5%) and 202 women (15.5%) made the list. Four of the top five richest people in the United States in 2006 were college dropouts: [[Bill Gates]], [[Sheldon Adelson]], [[Larry Ellison]], and [[Paul Allen]].<ref name=\"Bernstein, Peter W. 2007\"/>\n\nA few articles draw on data of the Forbes 400 to test an evolutionary hypothesis referred to as the [[Trivers\u2013Willard hypothesis]]. This hypothesis predicts that parents of high socioeconomic status produce more male offspring than parents of lower socioeconomic status.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Trivers|first1=Robert L.|last2=Willard|first2=Dan E.|year=1973|title=Natural selection of parental ability to vary the sex ratio of offspring|journal=Science|volume=179|issue=4068|pages=90\u201392|doi=10.1126/science.179.4068.90|pmid=4682135|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ef68c301208fed4a7d2839999a6dce8e899bcdf2}}</ref> Whereas an earlier study using data on the Forbes 400 shows a strong effect for U.S. billionaires that is consistent with the Trivers-Willard hypothesis,<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Cameron | first1 = E.

Second, it can only be found among heirs and not self-made billionaires.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Schnettler | first1 = S. | editor1-last = Sorci | editor1-first = Gabriele | title = Revisiting a Sample of U.S. Billionaires: How Sample Selection and Timing of Maternal Condition Influence Findings on the Trivers-Willard Effect | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0057446 | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = e57446 | year = 2013 | pmid =  23437389| pmc = 3578789}}</ref>\n\nThis has to do with the timing of wealth accumulation: some self-made billionaires had their children before they were rich, but heirs, by definition, were rich before ever becoming parents (see also <ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Cameron | first1 = E. Z. | title = Facultative adjustment of mammalian sex ratios in support of the Trivers-Willard hypothesis: Evidence for a mechanism | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2004.2773 | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 271 | issue = 1549 | pages = 1723\u20131728| year = 2004 | pmid =  15306293| pmc = 1691777}}</ref>). Third, the size of the effect was largely overestimated, given that the male offspring of billionaires as compared to female offspring is easier to find on the Web: Women sometimes change their last name upon marriage which makes some harder to find. Therefore, earlier reports on the male bias among billionaire offspring were partially an artifact of sample selection.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn 2010, a [[Business Insider]] ethnic-demographic breakdown of the Forbes 400 richest Americans found 3 gay people, 4 [[Indian Americans|Indians]], 6 [[Asian Americans|(non-Indian) Asians]], and 34 women on the list.<ref name=\"businessinsider2010\">{{cite web | last=Nolan | first=Hamilton | title=The Forbes 400: A Demographic Breakdown | website=Business Insider | date=September 23, 2010 | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/the-forbes-400-a-demographic-breakdown-2010-9 | access-date=December 30, 2017}}</ref> Additionally, [[American Jews]] made up as many as 30% of the richest 100,<ref name=\"businessinsider2010\"/> and (at least, in 2009) 139 of the Forbes 400.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jta.org/2009/10/05/fundermentalist/at-least-139-of-the-forbes-400-are-jewish#ixzz2XBm3uBTN|title=At least 139 of the Forbes 400 are Jewish - Jewish Telegraphic Agency|website=www.jta.org}}</ref> In 2017, just two [[African Americans]] made the Forbes 400: [[media proprietor]] [[Oprah Winfrey]] and tech investor [[Robert F.

In that time period, 97 immigrants (7.5%) and 202 women (15.5%) made the list. Four of the top five richest people in the United States in 2006 were college dropouts: [[Bill Gates]], [[Sheldon Adelson]], [[Larry Ellison]], and [[Paul Allen]].<ref name=\"Bernstein, Peter W. 2007\"/>\n\nA few articles draw on data of the Forbes 400 to test an evolutionary hypothesis referred to as the [[Trivers\u2013Willard hypothesis]].

Third, the size of the effect was largely overestimated, given that the male offspring of billionaires as compared to female offspring is easier to find on the Web: Women sometimes change their last name upon marriage which makes some harder to find.

To strengthen trading and power, [[Denmark\u2013Norway]] affirmed sovereignty over the island. Because of Norway's weak status, it lost sovereignty over Greenland in 1814 when the union was dissolved. Greenland became Danish in 1814, and was fully integrated in the Danish state in 1953 under the [[Constitution of Denmark]]. In 1973, Greenland joined the [[European Economic Community]] with Denmark. However, in a [[1982 Greenlandic European Communities membership referendum|referendum]] in 1982, a majority of the population voted for Greenland to withdraw from the [[European Economic Community|EEC]], which was effected in 1985.

[[Bluie]] was the military code name for Greenland.\n\nDuring this war, the system of government changed: [[List of governors of Greenland|Governor]] [[Eske Brun]] ruled the island under a law of 1925 that allowed governors to take control under extreme circumstances; Governor Aksel Svane was transferred to the United States to lead the commission to supply Greenland. The Danish [[Sl\u00e6depatruljen Sirius|Sirius Patrol]] guarded the northeastern shores of Greenland in 1942 using dogsleds. They detected several German [[weather station]]s and alerted American troops, who destroyed the facilities. After the collapse of the Third Reich, [[Albert Speer]] briefly considered escaping in a small aeroplane to hide out in Greenland, but changed his mind and decided to surrender to the [[United States Armed Forces]].<ref>[[Albert Speer|Speer, Albert]]. ''Inside the Third Reich,'' 1971</ref>\n\nGreenland had been a protected and very isolated society until 1940. The [[Politics of Denmark|Danish government]] had maintained a strict monopoly of [[Economy of Greenland|Greenlandic trade]], allowing only small scale [[troaking]] with Scottish whalers. In wartime Greenland developed a sense of self-reliance through self-government and independent communication with the outside world. Despite this change, in 1946 a commission including the highest Greenlandic council, the [[Landsr\u00e5dene]], recommended patience and no radical reform of the system. Two years later, the first step towards a change of government was initiated when a grand commission was established. A final report (G-50) was presented in 1950: Greenland was to be a modern [[welfare state]] with Denmark as sponsor and example. In 1953, Greenland was made an equal part of the Danish Kingdom. Home rule was granted in 1979.\n\n===Home rule and self-rule===\n{{See also|Greenlandic independence}}\n[[File:Golfbane Nuuk.JPG|thumb|The orthography and vocabulary of the Greenlandic language is governed by ''[[Oqaasileriffik]]'', the Greenlandic language secretariat, located in the ''Ilimmarfik'' [[University of Greenland]], [[Nuuk]].]]\n\nFollowing World War II, the United States developed a [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] interest in Greenland, and in 1946 the United States offered to [[Proposed United States purchase of Greenland|buy the island from Denmark]] for $100,000,000.

Danish citizenship was extended to Greenlanders. Danish policies toward Greenland consisted of a strategy of cultural assimilation \u2014 or de-Greenlandification. During this period, the Danish government promoted the exclusive use of the Danish language in official matters, and required Greenlanders to go to Denmark for their post-secondary education. Many Greenlandic children grew up in boarding schools in southern Denmark, and a number lost their cultural ties to Greenland. While the policies \"succeeded\" in the sense of shifting Greenlanders from being primarily subsistence hunters into being urbanized wage earners, the Greenlandic elite began to reassert a Greenlandic cultural identity.

Of the other groups, the [[lichen]]s are the most diverse, with about 950 species; there are 600-700 species of fungi; [[moss]]es and [[bryophyte]]s are also found. Most of Greenland's higher plants have [[wikt:Special:Search/circumpolar|circumpolar]] or [[circumboreal]] distributions; only a dozen species of [[saxifrage]] and [[hawkweed]] are [[endemic]].

Gross domestic product per capita is equivalent to that of the average economies of Europe.\n\nGreenland suffered an economic contraction in the early 1990s. But, since 1993, the economy has improved. The Greenland Home Rule Government (GHRG) has pursued a tight fiscal policy since the late 1980s, which has helped create surpluses in the public budget and low inflation. Since 1990, Greenland has registered a foreign-trade deficit following the closure of the last remaining lead and [[zinc]] mine that year.

Inuit, or Kalaallit, culture has a strong artistic tradition, dating back thousands of years. The Kalaallit are known for an art form of figures called ''[[tupilak]]'' or a \"spirit object.\" Traditional art-making practices thrive in the ''Ammassalik''.<ref name=ingo20>[[#Hessel|Hessel]], p. 20</ref> [[Sperm whale]] ivory remains a valued medium for carving.<ref>[[#Hessel|Hessel]], p. 21</ref>\n\nGreenland also has a successful, albeit small, music culture. Some popular [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]] bands and artists include [[Sume (band)|Sume]] (classic rock), [[Chilly Friday]] (rock), [[Nanook]] (rock), [[Siissisoq]] (rock), [[Nuuk Posse]] (hip hop) and [[Rasmus Lyberth]] (folk), who performed in the [[Denmark in the Eurovision Song Contest 1979|Danish national final for the 1979 Eurovision Song Contest]], performing in Greenlandic. The singer-songwriter [[Simon Lynge]] is the first musical artist from Greenland to have an album released across the United Kingdom, and to perform at the UK's [[Glastonbury Festival]]. The music culture of Greenland also includes traditional [[Inuit music]], largely revolving around singing and drums.\n\n===Sport===\n{{Main|Sport in Greenland}}\nSport is an important part of Greenlandic culture, as the population is generally quite active.<ref>[[#Wilcox|Wilcox and Latif]], p. 109</ref> Popular sports include [[association football]], [[track and field]], [[Team handball|handball]] and [[skiing]]. Handball is often referred to as the national sport,<ref name=\"handball\">[[#Wilcox|Wilcox and Latif]], p. 110</ref> and [[Greenland national handball team|Greenland's men's national team]] was ranked among the top 20 in the world in 2001.\n\nGreenland has excellent conditions for [[skiing]], [[fishing]], [[snowboarding]], [[ice climbing]] and [[rock climbing]], although [[mountain climbing]] and [[hiking]] are preferred by the general public. Although the environment is generally ill-suited for golf, there is a golf course in Nuuk.\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{Main|Greenlandic cuisine}}\nThe national dish of Greenland is [[suaasat]].

To strengthen trading and power, [[Denmark\u2013Norway]] affirmed sovereignty over the island. Because of Norway's weak status, it lost sovereignty over Greenland in 1814 when the union was dissolved. Greenland became Danish in 1814, and was fully integrated in the Danish state in 1953 under the [[Constitution of Denmark]]. In 1973, Greenland joined the [[European Economic Community]] with Denmark. However, in a [[1982 Greenlandic European Communities membership referendum|referendum]] in 1982, a majority of the population voted for Greenland to withdraw from the [[European Economic Community|EEC]], which was effected in 1985.

The [[Politics of Denmark|Danish government]] had maintained a strict monopoly of [[Economy of Greenland|Greenlandic trade]], allowing only small scale [[troaking]] with Scottish whalers. In wartime Greenland developed a sense of self-reliance through self-government and independent communication with the outside world. Despite this change, in 1946 a commission including the highest Greenlandic council, the [[Landsr\u00e5dene]], recommended patience and no radical reform of the system. Two years later, the first step towards a change of government was initiated when a grand commission was established. A final report (G-50) was presented in 1950: Greenland was to be a modern [[welfare state]] with Denmark as sponsor and example. In 1953, Greenland was made an equal part of the Danish Kingdom.

The last four are found naturally only in [[East Greenland]], having immigrated from [[Ellesmere Island]]. There are dozens of species of [[Pinniped|seals]] and [[whale]]s along the coast. Land fauna consists predominantly of animals which have spread from North America or, in the case of many birds and insects, from Europe. There are no native or free-living reptiles or amphibians on the island.<ref name=\"wildlife\">{{cite web |url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Natur_og_milj\u00f8/Zoologi/Dyreliv:_Danmark,_F\u00e6r\u00f8erne,_Gr\u00f8nland/Gr\u00f8nland_(Dyreliv) |title=Greenland Wildlife |year=2014 |work=Redaction |publisher=The Great Danish Encyclopedia |accessdate=8 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313204254/http://denstoredanske.dk/Natur_og_milj%C3%B8/Zoologi/Dyreliv:_Danmark,_F%C3%A6r%C3%B8erne,_Gr%C3%B8nland/Gr%C3%B8nland_(Dyreliv) |archive-date=13 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Greenland belongs to the Arctic province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. The island is sparsely populated in vegetation; plant life consists mainly of grassland and small shrubs, which are regularly grazed by livestock. The most common tree native to Greenland is the European white birch (''[[Betula pubescens]]'') along with gray-leaf willow (''[[Salix glauca]]''), rowan (''[[Sorbus aucuparia]]''), common juniper (''[[Juniperus communis]]'') and other smaller trees, mainly willows.\n\nGreenland's flora consists of about 500 species of \"higher\" plants, i.e. [[flowering plant]]s, [[fern]]s, [[horsetail]]s and [[lycopodiophyta]]. Of the other groups, the [[lichen]]s are the most diverse, with about 950 species; there are 600-700 species of fungi; [[moss]]es and [[bryophyte]]s are also found. Most of Greenland's higher plants have [[wikt:Special:Search/circumpolar|circumpolar]] or [[circumboreal]] distributions; only a dozen species of [[saxifrage]] and [[hawkweed]] are [[endemic]]. A few plant species were introduced by the Norsemen, such as [[Vicia cracca|cow vetch]].\n\n[[File:Greenland 377 (34999131992).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Greenland Dog]] was brought from Siberia 1,000 years ago.]]\nThe terrestrial vertebrates of Greenland include the [[Greenland dog]], which was introduced by the [[Inuit]], as well as [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]]-introduced species such as [[Greenlandic sheep]], [[goat]]s, [[cattle]], [[reindeer]], [[horse]], [[chicken]] and [[sheepdog]], all descendants of animals imported by Europeans.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} [[Marine mammals]] include the [[hooded seal]] (''Cystophora cristata'') as well as the [[grey seal]] (''Halichoerus grypus'').<ref name=\"brit1911\">\"Greenland\".

The dominance of the Forward and Inuit Community parties began to wane after the snap [[2014 Greenlandic general election|2014]] and [[2018 Greenlandic general election|2018]] elections.\n\nThe non-binding [[2008 Greenlandic self-government referendum|2008 referendum on self-governance]] favoured increased self-governance by 21,355 votes to 6,663.\n\nIn 1985, [[Greenland\u2013European Union relations|Greenland left the European Economic Community]] (EEC), unlike Denmark, which remains a member.

The mother then finds herself travelling through the bedroom mirror into [[Looking-Glass Land]] and becoming [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]], but remains an adult.<ref name=alice/>\n\nAlice finds a book containing \u201d[[Jabberwocky]]\", in [[mirror writing]], and sees [[chess piece]]s coming to life. She goes out into a garden with talking flowers. There, she meets the [[Red Queen (Through the Looking-Glass)|Red Queen]] from the chess board ([[Si\u00e2n Phillips|Sian Phillips]]), who shows her that the landscape is laid out like a gigantic chessboard. She will make Alice a queen if she can get as far as the eighth row. Alice becomes one of the [[White Queen (Through the Looking-Glass)|White Queen]]{{'}}s [[Pawn (chess)|pawns]], and gets into a train that takes her directly to the fourth row. In a wood, the Gnat ([[Steve Coogan]]) teaches her about the looking-glass insects. In crossing the wood where things have no names, she forgets her own name, but it comes back on the other side. Next she meets [[Tweedledum and Tweedledee]] ([[Gary Olsen]] and [[Marc Warren]]), who recite the poem \"[[The Walrus and the Carpenter]]\", with the [[Red King (Through the Looking-Glass)|Red King]] ([[Michael Medwin]]) asleep under a tree. The brothers get ready to fight but run away, frightened by a giant crow. \n\nThe [[White Queen (Through the Looking-Glass)|White Queen]] ([[Penelope Wilton]]) arrives and shows her powers of [[precognition]]. With her, Alice goes forward into the fifth row by crossing a stream in a rowing boat, but the Queen is then turned into [[the Sheep]].\n\nAlice enters the sixth row of the chess board by crossing another stream and meets [[Humpty Dumpty]] ([[Desmond Barrit]]) on his [[unbirthday]], who teaches Alice about [[portmanteau]] words before falling off his wall. The [[White King (Through the Looking-Glass)|White King]] ([[Geoffrey Palmer (actor)|Geoffrey Palmer]]), the king's horses, and the king's men try to help Humpty.\n\nAlice, still a white pawn, crosses yet another stream to enter the seventh row and finds herself in the land of the Red Knight ([[Greg Wise]]), who tries to capture her, but the [[White Knight (Through the Looking-Glass)|White Knight]] ([[Ian Holm]]) fights him off and leads her through a forest to the last stream, falling off his horse and reciting the poem [[Haddocks' Eyes]]. This stream is not much more than a ditch, and Alice can step across it into the eighth row, when a queen\u2019s crown appears on her head. She is joined by both the Red and White Queens, who use [[word play]] to baffle her. They issue invitations to a coronation party to be hosted by Alice, but the party is chaotic, and Alice finds herself shaking the Red Queen to calm her down.\n\nAlice wakes up safe at home with her daughter, little Alice.\n\n==Production==\nApart from the innovation that Alice is an adult, the screenplay follows the text of the book closely, preserving Carroll\u2019s dialogue almost word for word.

It combined the original Acorn ARM2 processor with a memory controller (MEMC), video controller (VIDC), and I/O controller (IOC).  In previous Acorn [[ARM architecture|ARM]]-powered computers, these were four discrete chips.

RISC architectures are advantageous over [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] processors for systems-on-chip because they require less digital logic, and therefore less power and area on [[Die (integrated circuit)|board]], and in the [[Embedded system|embedded]] and [[Mobile computing|mobile]] computing markets, area and power are often highly constrained.  In particular, SoC processor cores often use the [[ARM architecture]] because it is a [[Soft microprocessor|soft processor]] specified as an [[IP core]] and is more power efficient than [[x86]].<ref name=\"Furber ARM\" />\n\n==== Memories ====\n{{Further|Computer memory}}\nSystems-on-chip must have [[semiconductor memory]] blocks to perform their computation, as do [[microcontroller]]s and other [[embedded system]]s.  Depending on the application, SoC memory may form a [[memory hierarchy]] and [[cache hierarchy]].  In the mobile computing market, this is common, but in many [[Low-power electronics|low-power]] embedded microcontrollers, this is not necessary.\nMemory technologies for SoCs include [[read-only memory]] (ROM), [[random-access memory]] (RAM), Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM ([[EEPROM]]) and [[flash memory]].<ref name=\"Furber ARM\" />  As in other computer systems, RAM can be subdivided into relatively faster but more expensive [[Static random-access memory|static RAM]] (SRAM) and the slower but cheaper [[Dynamic random-access memory|dynamic RAM]] (DRAM).  When an SoC has a [[Cache (computing)|cache]] hierarchy, SRAM will usually be used to implement [[processor register]]s and cores' [[L1 cache]]s whereas DRAM will be used for lower levels of the cache hierarchy including [[main memory]].  \"Main memory\" may be specific to a single processor (which can be [[Multi-core processor|multi-core]]) when the SoC [[Multi-processor system-on-chip|has multiple processors]], in which case it is [[distributed memory]] and must be sent via {{Section link||Intermodule communication|nopage=y}} on-chip to be accessed by a different processor.<ref name=\":1\" />  For further discussion of multi-processing memory issues, see [[cache coherence]] and [[memory latency]].\n\n==== Interfaces ====\nSoCs include external [[Electrical connector|interfaces]], typically for [[communication protocol]]s. These are often based upon industry standards such as [[USB]], [[FireWire]], [[Ethernet]], [[Universal synchronous and asynchronous receiver-transmitter|USART]], [[Serial Peripheral Interface|SPI]], [[HDMI]], [[I\u00b2C]], etc. These interfaces will differ according to the intended application. [[Wireless network]]ing protocols such as [[Wi-Fi]], [[Bluetooth]], [[6LoWPAN]] and [[near-field communication]] may also be supported.\n\nWhen needed, SoCs include [[Analog signal|analog]] interfaces including [[Analog-to-digital converter|analog-to-digital]] and [[digital-to-analog converter]]s, often for [[signal processing]].  These may be able to interface with different types of [[sensor]]s or [[actuator]]s, including [[smart transducer]]s.  They may interface with application-specific [[Modularity|modules]] or shields.<ref group=\"nb\">In [[embedded system]]s, \"shields\" are analogous to [[expansion card]]s for [[Personal computer|PCs]]. They often fit over a [[microcontroller]] such as an [[Arduino]] or [[single-board computer]] such as the [[Raspberry Pi]] and function as [[peripheral]]s for the device.</ref>  Or they may be internal to the SoC, such as if an analog sensor is built in to the SoC and its readings must be converted to digital signals for mathematical processing.\n\n==== Digital signal processors ====\n[[Digital signal processor]] (DSP) cores are often included on systems-on-chip.  They perform [[signal processing]] operations in systems-on-chip for [[sensor]]s, [[actuator]]s, [[data collection]], [[data analysis]] and multimedia processing. DSP cores typically feature [[very long instruction word]] (VLIW) and [[SIMD|single instruction, multiple data]] (SIMD) [[instruction set architecture]]s, and are therefore highly amenable to exploiting [[instruction-level parallelism]] through [[Parallel processing (DSP implementation)|parallel processing]] and [[superscalar execution]].<ref name=\":1\" />{{Rp|4}}  DSP cores most often feature application-specific instructions, and as such are typically [[application-specific instruction-set processor]]s (ASIP).  Such application-specific instructions correspond to dedicated hardware [[functional unit]]s that compute those instructions.\n\nTypical DSP instructions include [[Multiply\u2013accumulate operation|multiply-accumulate]], [[Fast Fourier transform]], [[Fused multiply-accumulate|fused multiply-add]], and [[convolution]]s.\n\n==== Other ====\nAs with other computer systems, SoCs require [[Clock generator|timing sources]] to generate [[clock signal]]s, control execution of SoC functions and provide time context to [[signal processing]] applications of the SoC, if needed.  Popular time sources are [[crystal oscillators]] and [[phase-locked loop]]s.\n\nSystem-on-chip [[peripheral]]s including [[counter (digital)|counter]]-timers, real-time [[timer]]s and [[power-on reset]] generators. SoCs also include [[voltage regulator]]s and [[power management]] circuits.\n\n=== Intermodule communication ===\nSystems-on-chip comprise many [[execution unit]]s.  These units must often send [[data]] and [[Instruction (computing)|instructions]] back and forth.  Because of this, all but the most trivial SoCs require [[Communications system|communications subsystems]].  Originally, as with other [[microcomputer]] technologies, [[Bus (computing)|data bus]] architectures were used, but recently designs based on sparse intercommunication networks known as [[Network on a chip|networks-on-chip]] (NoC) have risen to prominence and are forecast to overtake bus architectures for SoC design in the near future.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Network-on-chip: the Next Generation of System-on-Chip Integration|last=Kundu|first=Santanu|last2=Chattopadhyay|first2=Santanu|publisher=CRC Press|year=2014|isbn=9781466565272|edition=1st|location=Boca Raton, FL|pages=|oclc=895661009}}</ref>\n\n==== Bus-based communication ====\nHistorically, a shared global [[bus (computing)|computer bus]] typically connected the different components, also called \"blocks\" of the System-on-Chip.<ref name=\":0\" />  A very common bus for system-on-chip communications is ARM's royalty-free Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture ([[Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture|AMBA]]) standard.\n\n[[Direct memory access]] controllers route data directly between external interfaces and SoC memory, bypassing the CPU or [[control unit]], thereby increasing the data [[throughput]] of the system-on-chip.

These challenges are prohibitive to supporting [[manycore]] systems on chip.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|xiii}}\n\n==== Network-on-Chip ====\n{{Main|Network on a chip}}\nIn the late [[2010s]], a trend of systems-on-chip implementing [[communications subsystem]]s in terms of a network-like topology instead of [[bus (computing)|bus-based]] protocols has emerged.  A trend towards [[Multi-processor system-on-chip|more processor cores on SoCs]] has caused on-chip communication efficiency to become one of the key factors in determining the overall system performance and cost.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|xiii}}  This has led to the emergence of interconnection networks with [[Router (computing)|router]]-based [[packet switching]] known as \"[[network on a chip|networks on chip]]\" (NoCs) to overcome the [[Bottleneck (engineering)|bottlenecks]] of bus-based networks.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|xiii}}\n\nNetworks-on-chip have advantages including destination- and application-specific [[routing]], greater power efficiency and reduced possibility of [[bus contention]].  Network-on-chip architectures take inspiration from [[networking protocol]]s like [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] and the [[Internet protocol suite]] for on-chip communication,<ref name=\":0\" /> although they typically have fewer [[network layer]]s.  Optimal network-on-chip [[network architecture]]s are an ongoing area of much research interest.  NoC architectures range from traditional distributed computing [[Network topology|network topologies]] such as [[Torus interconnect|torus]], [[Hypercube internetwork topology|hypercube]], [[Mesh networking|meshes]] and [[tree network]]s to [[genetic algorithm scheduling]] to [[randomized algorithm]]s such as [[Branching random walk|random walks with branching]] and randomized [[time to live]] (TTL).\n\nMany SoC researchers consider NoC architectures to be the future of system-on-chip design because they have been shown to efficiently meet power and throughput needs of SoC designs.  Current NoC architectures are two-dimensional.  2D IC design has limited [[Floorplan (microelectronics)|floorplanning]] choices as the number of cores in SoCs increase, so as [[three-dimensional integrated circuit]]s (3DICs) emerge, SoC designers are looking towards building three-dimensional on-chip networks known as 3DNoCs.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Design flow ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2017}}\n{{Main|Design flow (EDA)|Physical design (electronics)|Platform-based design|l1=Electronics design flow|l3=}}{{See also|Systems design|Software design|label 2=Software design process}}[[Image:SoCDesignFlow.svg|right|275px|thumbnail|System-on-a-chip design flow]]\n\nA system on chip consists of both the [[electronic hardware|hardware]], described in {{Section link||Structure|nopage=y}}, and the [[software]] controlling the microcontroller, microprocessor or digital signal processor cores, peripherals and interfaces.  The [[design flow (EDA)|design flow]] for an SoC aims to develop this hardware and software at the same time, also known as architectural co-design.  The design flow must also take into account optimizations ({{Section link||Optimization goals|nopage=y}}) and constraints.\n\nMost SoCs are developed from pre-qualified hardware component [[Semiconductor intellectual property core|IP core specifications]] for the hardware elements and [[execution unit]]s, collectively \"blocks\", described above, together with software [[device driver]]s that may control their operation.  Of particular importance are the [[protocol stack]]s that drive industry-standard interfaces like [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]].  The hardware blocks are put together using [[computer-aided design]] tools, specifically [[electronic design automation]] tools; the [[modular programming|software modules]] are integrated using a software [[integrated development environment]].\n\nSystems-on-chip components are also often designed in [[high-level programming language]]s such as [[C++]], [[MATLAB]] or [[SystemC]] and converted to [[Register-transfer level|RTL]] designs through [[high-level synthesis]] (HLS) tools such as [[C to HDL]] or [[flow to HDL]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.eejournal.com/archives/articles/20110825-mathworks/|title=Best Practices for FPGA Prototyping of MATLAB and Simulink Algorithms|date=2011-08-25|work=EEJournal|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en-US}}</ref>  HLS products called \"algorithmic synthesis\" allow designers to use C++ to model and synthesize system, circuit, software and verification levels all in one high level language commonly known to [[computer engineers]] in a manner independent of time scales, which are typically specified in HDL.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1271261|title=The 'why' and 'what' of algorithmic synthesis|last=Bowyer|first=Bryan|date=2005-02-05|website=[[EE Times]]|access-date=2018-10-08}}</ref>  Other components can remain software and be compiled and embedded onto [[Soft microprocessor|soft-core processors]] included in the SoC as modules in HDL as [[Semiconductor intellectual property core|IP cores]].\n\nOnce the [[Computer architecture|architecture]] of the SoC has been defined, any new hardware elements are written in an abstract [[hardware description language]] termed [[Register-transfer level|register transfer level]] (RTL) which defines the circuit behavior, or synthesized into RTL from a high level language through high-level synthesis.

[[Field-programmable gate array]]s (FPGAs) are favored for prototyping systems-on-chip because [[FPGA prototyping|FPGA prototypes]] are reprogrammable, allow [[debugging]] and are more flexible than [[application-specific integrated circuit]]s (ASICs).<ref name=\"nm prototyping\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.tayden.com/publications/Nanometer%20Prototyping.pdf|title=Nanometer prototyping|last=Rittman|first=Danny|date=2006-01-05|website=Tayden Design|access-date=2018-10-07}}</ref><ref name=\"Reason to debug in FPGA\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.design-reuse.com/articles/13550/fpga-prototyping-to-structured-asic-production-to-reduce-cost-risk-ttm.html|title=FPGA Prototyping to Structured ASIC Production to Reduce Cost, Risk & TTM|website=Design And Reuse|access-date=2018-10-07}}</ref>\n\nWith high capacity and fast compilation time, simulation acceleration and emulation are powerful technologies that provide wide visibility into systems.

Acceleration and emulation boxes are also very large and expensive at over US$1 million.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nFPGA prototypes, in contrast, use FPGAs directly to enable engineers to validate and test at, or close to, a system's full operating frequency with real-world stimuli.  Tools such as Certus<ref>Brian Bailey, EE Times. \"[http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1317504 Tektronix hopes to shake up ASIC prototyping].\" October 30, 2012. Retrieved July 28, 2015.</ref> are used to insert probes in the FPGA RTL that make signals available for observation.  This is used to debug hardware, firmware and software interactions across multiple FPGAs with capabilities similar to a logic analyzer.\n\nIn parallel, the hardware elements are grouped and passed through a process of [[logic synthesis]], during which performance constraints, such as operational frequency and expected signal delays, are applied.  This generates an output known as a [[netlist]] describing the design as a physical circuit and its interconnections.  These netlists are combined with the [[glue logic]] connecting the components to produce the schematic description of the SoC as a circuit which can be [[printed circuit board|printed]] onto a chip.  This process is known as [[place and route]] and precedes [[tape-out]] in the event that the SoCs are produced as [[application-specific integrated circuit]]s (ASIC).\n\n== Optimization goals ==\nSystems-on-chip must optimize [[Power consumption|power use]], area on [[Die (integrated circuit)|die]], communication, positioning for [[Locality of reference|locality]] between modular units and other factors.  Optimization is necessarily a design goal of systems-on-chip.  If optimization was not necessary, the engineers would use a [[multi-chip module]] architecture without accounting for the area utilization, power consumption or performance of the system to the same extent.\n\nCommon optimization targets for system-on-chip designs follow, with explanations of each.  In general, optimizing any of these quantities may be a hard [[combinatorial optimization]] problem, and can indeed be [[NP-hardness|NP-hard]] fairly easily.  Therefore, sophisticated [[optimization algorithm]]s are often required and it may be practical to use [[approximation algorithm]]s or [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristics]] in some cases.  Additionally, most SoC designs contain [[Multivariate optimization|multiple variables to optimize simultaneously]], so [[Pareto efficiency|Pareto efficient]] solutions are sought after in SoC design.  Oftentimes the goals of optimizing some of these quantities are directly at odds, further adding complexity to design optimization of systems-on-chip and introducing [[Trade-off#Engineering|trade-offs]] in system design.\n\nFor broader coverage of trade-offs and [[requirements analysis]], see [[requirements engineering]].\n\n=== Targets ===\n\n==== Power consumption ====\nSystems-on-chip are optimized to minimize the [[Electric power#Definition|electrical power]] used to perform the SoC's functions.  Most SoCs must use low power.  SoC systems often require long [[battery life]] (such as [[smartphone]]s), can potentially spending months or years without a power source needing to maintain autonomous function, and often are limited in power use by a high number of [[Embedded system|embedded]] SoCs being [[Distributed computing|networked together]] in an area.  Additionally, energy costs can be high and conserving energy will reduce the [[total cost of ownership]] of the SoC.  Finally, [[waste heat]] from high energy consumption can damage other circuit components if too much heat is dissipated, giving another pragmatic reason to conserve energy.  The amount of [[energy]] used in a circuit is the [[integral]] of [[Power (physics)|power]] consumed with respect to time, and the [[Mean value theorem|average rate]] of power consumption is the product of [[Electric current|current]] by [[voltage]].  Equivalently, by [[Ohm's law]], power is current squared times resistance or voltage squared divided by [[Resistance (physics)|resistance]]:\n\n<math display=\"block\">P = IV = \\frac{V^2}{R} = {I^2}{R}</math>Systems-on-chip are frequently embedded in [[Mobile device|portable devices]] such as [[smartphones]], [[GPS navigation device]]s, digital [[Digital watch|watches]] (including [[smartwatch]]es) and [[netbook]]s.  Customers want long battery lives for [[mobile computing]] devices, another reason that power consumption must be minimized in systems-on-chip. [[Multimedia application]]s are often executed on these devices, including [[video game]]s, [[video streaming]], [[image processing]]; all of which have grown in [[computational complexity]] in recent years with user demands and expectations for higher-[[Video quality|quality]] multimedia.  Computation is more demanding as expectations move towards [[3D video]] at [[high resolution]] with [[List of video compression formats|multiple standards]], so SoCs performing multimedia tasks must be computationally capable platform while being low power to run off a standard mobile battery.<ref name=\":1\" />{{Rp|3}}\n\n==== Performance per watt ====\n{{See also|Green computing}}\nSoCs are optimized to maximize [[power efficiency]] in performance per watt: maximize the performance of the SoC given a budget of power usage.  Many applications such as [[edge computing]], [[distributed processing]] and [[ambient intelligence]] require a certain level of [[Computer performance|computational performance]], but power is limited in most SoC environments.  The [[ARM architecture]] has greater performance per watt than [[x86]] in embedded systems, so it is preferred over x86 for most SoC applications requiring an [[Soft microprocessor|embedded processor]].\n\n==== Waste heat ====\n{{Main|Heat generation in integrated circuits}}{{See also|Thermal management (electronics)|Thermal design power|label 1=Thermal management in electronics}}\nSoC designs are optimized to minimize [[waste heat]] [[dissipation|output]] on the chip.  As with other [[integrated circuit]]s, heat generated due to high [[power density]] are the [[Bottleneck (engineering)|bottleneck]] to further [[miniaturization]] of components.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Heat Management in Integrated circuits: On-chip and system-level monitoring and cooling|last=Ogrenci-Memik|first=Seda|publisher=The Institution of Engineering and Technology|year=2015|isbn=9781849199353|location=London, United Kingdom|pages=|oclc=934678500}}</ref>{{Rp|1}}  The power densities of high speed integrated circuits, particularly microprocessors and including SoCs, have become highly uneven.  Too much waste heat can damage circuits and erode [[Reliability (semiconductor)|reliability]] of the circuit over time.  High temperatures and thermal stress negatively impact reliability, [[stress migration]], decreased [[mean time between failures]], [[electromigration]], [[wire bonding]], [[Metastability (electronics)|metastability]] and other performance degradation of the SoC over time.<ref name=\":2\" />{{Rp|2\u20139}}\n\nIn particular, most SoCs are in a small physical area or volume and therefore the effects of waste heat are compounded because there is little room for it to diffuse out of the system.  Because of high [[transistor count]]s on modern devices due to [[Moore's law]], oftentimes a layout of sufficient throughput and high [[Transistors density|transistor density]] is physically realizable from [[Semiconductor device fabrication|fabrication processes]] but would result in unacceptably high amounts of heat in the circuit's volume.<ref name=\":2\" />{{Rp|1}}\n\nThese thermal effects force SoC and other chip designers to apply conservative [[design margin]]s, creating less performant devices to mitigate the risk of [[catastrophic failure]].  Due to increased [[Transistors density|transistor densities]] as length scales get smaller, each [[Semiconductor node|process generation]] produces more heat output than the last.  Compounding this problem, system-on-chip architectures are usually heterogeneous, creating spatially inhomogeneous [[heat flux]]es, which cannot be effectively mitigated by uniform [[passive cooling]].<ref name=\":2\" />{{Rp|1}}\n\n==== Throughput ====\n{{Expand section|date=October 2018}}\nSoCs are optimized to maximize computational and communications [[throughput]].\n\n==== Latency ====\n{{Expand section|date=October 2018}}\nSoCs are optimized to minimize [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] for some or all of their functions.  This can be accomplished by [[Integrated circuit layout|laying out]] elements with proper proximity and [[Locality of reference|locality]] to each-other to minimize the interconnection delays and maximize the speed at which data is communicated between modules, [[Execution unit|functional units]] and memories.  In general, optimizing to minimize latency is an [[NP-completeness|NP-complete]] problem equivalent to the [[boolean satisfiability problem]].\n\nFor [[Task (computing)|tasks]] running on processor cores, latency and throughput can be improved with [[Scheduling (computing)|task scheduling]].  Some tasks run in application-specific hardware units, however, and even task scheduling may not be sufficient to optimize all software-based tasks to meet timing and throughput constraints.\n\n=== Methodologies ===\n{{Further|Multi-objective optimization|Multiple-criteria decision analysis|Architecture tradeoff analysis method|label3=Architecture tradeoff analysis}}\n{{Expand section|date=October 2018|small=no}}\nSystems on chip are modeled with standard hardware [[verification and validation]] techniques, but additional techniques are used to model and optimize SoC design alternatives to make the system optimal with respect to [[multiple-criteria decision analysis]] on the above optimization targets.\n\n==== Task scheduling ====\n[[Scheduling (computing)|Task scheduling]] is an important activity in any computer system with multiple [[Process (computing)|processes]] or [[Thread (computing)|threads]] sharing a single processor core.  It is important to reduce {{Section link||Latency|nopage=y}} and increase {{Section link||Throughput|nopage=y}} for [[embedded software]] running on an SoC's {{Section link||Processor cores|nopage=y}}.  Not every important computing activity in a system-on-chip is performed in software running on on-chip processors, but scheduling can drastically improve performance of software-based tasks and other tasks involving [[shared resource]]s.\n\nSoCs often schedule tasks according to [[network scheduling]] and [[Stochastic scheduling|randomized scheduling]] algorithms.\n\n==== Pipelining ====\n{{Broader|Pipeline (computing)}}\nHardware and software tasks are often pipelined in [[processor design]].  Pipelining is an important principle for [[speedup]] in [[computer architecture]].  They are frequently used in [[GPU]]s ([[graphics pipeline]]) and RISC processors (evolutions of the [[classic RISC pipeline]]), but are also applied to application-specific tasks such as [[digital signal processing]] and multimedia manipulations in the context of systems-on-chip.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Probabilistic modeling ====\nSystems-on-chip are often analyzed though [[probabilistic model]]s, {{Section link|Queueing theory|Queueing networks}} and [[Markov chain]]s.  For instance, [[Little's law]] allows SoC states and NoC buffers to be modeled as arrival processes and analyzed through [[Poisson random variable]]s and [[Poisson process]]es.\n\n==== Markov chains ====\nSoCs are often modeled with [[Markov chain]]s, both [[Markov chain#Discrete-time Markov chain|discrete time]] and [[Markov chain#Continuous-time Markov chain|continuous time]] variants.  Markov chain modeling allows [[asymptotic analysis]] of the system-on-chip's [[Markov chain#Steady-state analysis and limiting distributions|steady state distribution]] of power, heat, latency and other factors to allow design decisions to be optimized for the common case.\n\n== Fabrication ==\n{{Ref improve section|date=March 2017}}{{See|Semiconductor device fabrication}}\n\nSoC chips are typically [[semiconductor device fabrication|fabricated]] using [[metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor]] (MOS) technology.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lin |first1=Youn-Long Steve |title=Essential Issues in SOC Design: Designing Complex Systems-on-Chip |date=2007 |publisher=[[Springer Science & Business Media]] |isbn=9781402053528 |page=176 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7OV9lEn9LiQC&pg=PA176}}</ref> The netlists described above are used as the basis for the physical design ([[place and route]]) flow to convert the designers' intent into the design of the SoC.  Throughout this conversion process, the design is analyzed with static timing modeling, simulation and other tools to ensure that it meets the specified operational parameters such as frequency, power consumption and dissipation, functional integrity (as described in the register transfer level code) and electrical integrity.\n\nWhen all known bugs have been rectified and these have been re-verified and all physical design checks are done, the physical design files describing each layer of the chip are sent to the foundry's mask shop where a full set of glass lithographic masks will be etched.  These are sent to a wafer fabrication plant to create the SoC dice before packaging and testing.\n\nSoCs can be fabricated by several technologies, including:\n\n* [[Full custom]] ASIC\n* [[Standard cell]] ASIC\n* [[Field-programmable gate array]] (FPGA)\n\nASICs consume less power and are faster than FPGAs but cannot be reprogrammed and are expensive to manufacture. FPGA designs are more suitable for lower volume designs, but after enough units of production ASICs reduce the total cost of ownership.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://numato.com/blog/differences-between-fpga-and-asics/|title=FPGA vs ASIC: Differences between them and which one to use? \u2013 Numato Lab Help Center|website=numato.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-17}}</ref>\n\nSoC designs consume less power and have a lower cost and higher reliability than the multi-chip systems that they replace. With fewer packages in the system, assembly costs are reduced as well.\n\nHowever, like most [[very-large-scale integration]] (VLSI) designs, the total cost{{Clarify|reason=what kind of cost?|date=May 2018}} is higher for one large chip than for the same functionality distributed over several smaller chips, because of [[Semiconductor device fabrication#Device test|lower yields]]{{Clarify|reason=confusing to non-experts|date=May 2018}} and higher [[non-recurring engineering]] costs.\n\nWhen it is not feasible to construct an SoC for a particular application, an alternative is a [[system in package]] (SiP) comprising a number of chips in a single [[chip carrier|package]].  When produced in large volumes, SoC is more cost-effective than SiP because its packaging is simpler.<ref>[[EE Times]]. \"[http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1153043 The Great Debate: SOC vs. SIP].\" March 21, 2005.

Popular time sources are [[crystal oscillators]] and [[phase-locked loop]]s.\n\nSystem-on-chip [[peripheral]]s including [[counter (digital)|counter]]-timers, real-time [[timer]]s and [[power-on reset]] generators. SoCs also include [[voltage regulator]]s and [[power management]] circuits.\n\n=== Intermodule communication ===\nSystems-on-chip comprise many [[execution unit]]s.  These units must often send [[data]] and [[Instruction (computing)|instructions]] back and forth.  Because of this, all but the most trivial SoCs require [[Communications system|communications subsystems]].  Originally, as with other [[microcomputer]] technologies, [[Bus (computing)|data bus]] architectures were used, but recently designs based on sparse intercommunication networks known as [[Network on a chip|networks-on-chip]] (NoC) have risen to prominence and are forecast to overtake bus architectures for SoC design in the near future.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Network-on-chip: the Next Generation of System-on-Chip Integration|last=Kundu|first=Santanu|last2=Chattopadhyay|first2=Santanu|publisher=CRC Press|year=2014|isbn=9781466565272|edition=1st|location=Boca Raton, FL|pages=|oclc=895661009}}</ref>\n\n==== Bus-based communication ====\nHistorically, a shared global [[bus (computing)|computer bus]] typically connected the different components, also called \"blocks\" of the System-on-Chip.<ref name=\":0\" />  A very common bus for system-on-chip communications is ARM's royalty-free Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture ([[Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture|AMBA]]) standard.\n\n[[Direct memory access]] controllers route data directly between external interfaces and SoC memory, bypassing the CPU or [[control unit]], thereby increasing the data [[throughput]] of the system-on-chip.  This is similar to some [[device driver]]s of peripherals on component-based [[multi-chip module]] PC architectures.\n\nComputer buses are limited in [[scalability]], supporting only up to tens of cores ([[multicore]]) on a single chip.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|xiii}}  Wire delay is not scalable due to continued [[miniaturization]], [[Computer performance|system performance]] does not scale with the number of cores attached, the SoC's [[operating frequency]] must decrease with each additional core attached for power to be sustainable, and long wires consume large amounts of electrical power. These challenges are prohibitive to supporting [[manycore]] systems on chip.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|xiii}}\n\n==== Network-on-Chip ====\n{{Main|Network on a chip}}\nIn the late [[2010s]], a trend of systems-on-chip implementing [[communications subsystem]]s in terms of a network-like topology instead of [[bus (computing)|bus-based]] protocols has emerged.  A trend towards [[Multi-processor system-on-chip|more processor cores on SoCs]] has caused on-chip communication efficiency to become one of the key factors in determining the overall system performance and cost.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|xiii}}  This has led to the emergence of interconnection networks with [[Router (computing)|router]]-based [[packet switching]] known as \"[[network on a chip|networks on chip]]\" (NoCs) to overcome the [[Bottleneck (engineering)|bottlenecks]] of bus-based networks.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|xiii}}\n\nNetworks-on-chip have advantages including destination- and application-specific [[routing]], greater power efficiency and reduced possibility of [[bus contention]].  Network-on-chip architectures take inspiration from [[networking protocol]]s like [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] and the [[Internet protocol suite]] for on-chip communication,<ref name=\":0\" /> although they typically have fewer [[network layer]]s.  Optimal network-on-chip [[network architecture]]s are an ongoing area of much research interest.  NoC architectures range from traditional distributed computing [[Network topology|network topologies]] such as [[Torus interconnect|torus]], [[Hypercube internetwork topology|hypercube]], [[Mesh networking|meshes]] and [[tree network]]s to [[genetic algorithm scheduling]] to [[randomized algorithm]]s such as [[Branching random walk|random walks with branching]] and randomized [[time to live]] (TTL).\n\nMany SoC researchers consider NoC architectures to be the future of system-on-chip design because they have been shown to efficiently meet power and throughput needs of SoC designs.  Current NoC architectures are two-dimensional.  2D IC design has limited [[Floorplan (microelectronics)|floorplanning]] choices as the number of cores in SoCs increase, so as [[three-dimensional integrated circuit]]s (3DICs) emerge, SoC designers are looking towards building three-dimensional on-chip networks known as 3DNoCs.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Design flow ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2017}}\n{{Main|Design flow (EDA)|Physical design (electronics)|Platform-based design|l1=Electronics design flow|l3=}}{{See also|Systems design|Software design|label 2=Software design process}}[[Image:SoCDesignFlow.svg|right|275px|thumbnail|System-on-a-chip design flow]]\n\nA system on chip consists of both the [[electronic hardware|hardware]], described in {{Section link||Structure|nopage=y}}, and the [[software]] controlling the microcontroller, microprocessor or digital signal processor cores, peripherals and interfaces.  The [[design flow (EDA)|design flow]] for an SoC aims to develop this hardware and software at the same time, also known as architectural co-design.  The design flow must also take into account optimizations ({{Section link||Optimization goals|nopage=y}}) and constraints.\n\nMost SoCs are developed from pre-qualified hardware component [[Semiconductor intellectual property core|IP core specifications]] for the hardware elements and [[execution unit]]s, collectively \"blocks\", described above, together with software [[device driver]]s that may control their operation.  Of particular importance are the [[protocol stack]]s that drive industry-standard interfaces like [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]].  The hardware blocks are put together using [[computer-aided design]] tools, specifically [[electronic design automation]] tools; the [[modular programming|software modules]] are integrated using a software [[integrated development environment]].\n\nSystems-on-chip components are also often designed in [[high-level programming language]]s such as [[C++]], [[MATLAB]] or [[SystemC]] and converted to [[Register-transfer level|RTL]] designs through [[high-level synthesis]] (HLS) tools such as [[C to HDL]] or [[flow to HDL]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.eejournal.com/archives/articles/20110825-mathworks/|title=Best Practices for FPGA Prototyping of MATLAB and Simulink Algorithms|date=2011-08-25|work=EEJournal|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en-US}}</ref>  HLS products called \"algorithmic synthesis\" allow designers to use C++ to model and synthesize system, circuit, software and verification levels all in one high level language commonly known to [[computer engineers]] in a manner independent of time scales, which are typically specified in HDL.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1271261|title=The 'why' and 'what' of algorithmic synthesis|last=Bowyer|first=Bryan|date=2005-02-05|website=[[EE Times]]|access-date=2018-10-08}}</ref>  Other components can remain software and be compiled and embedded onto [[Soft microprocessor|soft-core processors]] included in the SoC as modules in HDL as [[Semiconductor intellectual property core|IP cores]].\n\nOnce the [[Computer architecture|architecture]] of the SoC has been defined, any new hardware elements are written in an abstract [[hardware description language]] termed [[Register-transfer level|register transfer level]] (RTL) which defines the circuit behavior, or synthesized into RTL from a high level language through high-level synthesis.  These elements are connected together in a hardware description language to create the full SoC design.  The logic specified to connect these components and convert between possibly different interfaces provided by different vendors is called [[glue logic]].\n\n=== Design verification ===\n{{Further|Functional verification|Signoff (electronic design automation)||label2=}}\nChips are verified for logical correctness before being sent to a [[Semiconductor fabrication plant|semiconductor foundry]].  This process is called [[functional verification]] and it accounts for a significant portion of the time and energy expended in the [[Integrated circuit development|chip design life cycle]], often quoted as 70%.<ref name=\"70% verification?\">[[EE Times]]. \"[http://www.eetimes.com/author.asp?section_id=36&doc_id=1264922 Is verification really 70 percent?].\" June 14, 2004.

[[Software bug|Bugs]] found in the verification stage are reported to the designer.\n\nTraditionally, engineers have employed simulation acceleration, [[emulator|emulation]] or prototyping on [[Reconfigurable computing|reprogrammable hardware]] to verify and debug hardware and software for SoC designs prior to the finalization of the design, known as [[tape-out]]. [[Field-programmable gate array]]s (FPGAs) are favored for prototyping systems-on-chip because [[FPGA prototyping|FPGA prototypes]] are reprogrammable, allow [[debugging]] and are more flexible than [[application-specific integrated circuit]]s (ASICs).<ref name=\"nm prototyping\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.tayden.com/publications/Nanometer%20Prototyping.pdf|title=Nanometer prototyping|last=Rittman|first=Danny|date=2006-01-05|website=Tayden Design|access-date=2018-10-07}}</ref><ref name=\"Reason to debug in FPGA\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.design-reuse.com/articles/13550/fpga-prototyping-to-structured-asic-production-to-reduce-cost-risk-ttm.html|title=FPGA Prototyping to Structured ASIC Production to Reduce Cost, Risk & TTM|website=Design And Reuse|access-date=2018-10-07}}</ref>\n\nWith high capacity and fast compilation time, simulation acceleration and emulation are powerful technologies that provide wide visibility into systems.  Both technologies, however, operate slowly, on the order of MHz, which may be significantly slower \u2013 up to 100 times slower \u2013 than the SoC's operating frequency.  Acceleration and emulation boxes are also very large and expensive at over US$1 million.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nFPGA prototypes, in contrast, use FPGAs directly to enable engineers to validate and test at, or close to, a system's full operating frequency with real-world stimuli.  Tools such as Certus<ref>Brian Bailey, EE Times. \"[http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1317504 Tektronix hopes to shake up ASIC prototyping].\" October 30, 2012. Retrieved July 28, 2015.</ref> are used to insert probes in the FPGA RTL that make signals available for observation.  This is used to debug hardware, firmware and software interactions across multiple FPGAs with capabilities similar to a logic analyzer.\n\nIn parallel, the hardware elements are grouped and passed through a process of [[logic synthesis]], during which performance constraints, such as operational frequency and expected signal delays, are applied.  This generates an output known as a [[netlist]] describing the design as a physical circuit and its interconnections.  These netlists are combined with the [[glue logic]] connecting the components to produce the schematic description of the SoC as a circuit which can be [[printed circuit board|printed]] onto a chip.  This process is known as [[place and route]] and precedes [[tape-out]] in the event that the SoCs are produced as [[application-specific integrated circuit]]s (ASIC).\n\n== Optimization goals ==\nSystems-on-chip must optimize [[Power consumption|power use]], area on [[Die (integrated circuit)|die]], communication, positioning for [[Locality of reference|locality]] between modular units and other factors.  Optimization is necessarily a design goal of systems-on-chip.  If optimization was not necessary, the engineers would use a [[multi-chip module]] architecture without accounting for the area utilization, power consumption or performance of the system to the same extent.\n\nCommon optimization targets for system-on-chip designs follow, with explanations of each.  In general, optimizing any of these quantities may be a hard [[combinatorial optimization]] problem, and can indeed be [[NP-hardness|NP-hard]] fairly easily.  Therefore, sophisticated [[optimization algorithm]]s are often required and it may be practical to use [[approximation algorithm]]s or [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristics]] in some cases.  Additionally, most SoC designs contain [[Multivariate optimization|multiple variables to optimize simultaneously]], so [[Pareto efficiency|Pareto efficient]] solutions are sought after in SoC design.  Oftentimes the goals of optimizing some of these quantities are directly at odds, further adding complexity to design optimization of systems-on-chip and introducing [[Trade-off#Engineering|trade-offs]] in system design.\n\nFor broader coverage of trade-offs and [[requirements analysis]], see [[requirements engineering]].\n\n=== Targets ===\n\n==== Power consumption ====\nSystems-on-chip are optimized to minimize the [[Electric power#Definition|electrical power]] used to perform the SoC's functions.  Most SoCs must use low power.  SoC systems often require long [[battery life]] (such as [[smartphone]]s), can potentially spending months or years without a power source needing to maintain autonomous function, and often are limited in power use by a high number of [[Embedded system|embedded]] SoCs being [[Distributed computing|networked together]] in an area.  Additionally, energy costs can be high and conserving energy will reduce the [[total cost of ownership]] of the SoC.  Finally, [[waste heat]] from high energy consumption can damage other circuit components if too much heat is dissipated, giving another pragmatic reason to conserve energy.  The amount of [[energy]] used in a circuit is the [[integral]] of [[Power (physics)|power]] consumed with respect to time, and the [[Mean value theorem|average rate]] of power consumption is the product of [[Electric current|current]] by [[voltage]].  Equivalently, by [[Ohm's law]], power is current squared times resistance or voltage squared divided by [[Resistance (physics)|resistance]]:\n\n<math display=\"block\">P = IV = \\frac{V^2}{R} = {I^2}{R}</math>Systems-on-chip are frequently embedded in [[Mobile device|portable devices]] such as [[smartphones]], [[GPS navigation device]]s, digital [[Digital watch|watches]] (including [[smartwatch]]es) and [[netbook]]s.  Customers want long battery lives for [[mobile computing]] devices, another reason that power consumption must be minimized in systems-on-chip. [[Multimedia application]]s are often executed on these devices, including [[video game]]s, [[video streaming]], [[image processing]]; all of which have grown in [[computational complexity]] in recent years with user demands and expectations for higher-[[Video quality|quality]] multimedia.  Computation is more demanding as expectations move towards [[3D video]] at [[high resolution]] with [[List of video compression formats|multiple standards]], so SoCs performing multimedia tasks must be computationally capable platform while being low power to run off a standard mobile battery.<ref name=\":1\" />{{Rp|3}}\n\n==== Performance per watt ====\n{{See also|Green computing}}\nSoCs are optimized to maximize [[power efficiency]] in performance per watt: maximize the performance of the SoC given a budget of power usage.  Many applications such as [[edge computing]], [[distributed processing]] and [[ambient intelligence]] require a certain level of [[Computer performance|computational performance]], but power is limited in most SoC environments.  The [[ARM architecture]] has greater performance per watt than [[x86]] in embedded systems, so it is preferred over x86 for most SoC applications requiring an [[Soft microprocessor|embedded processor]].\n\n==== Waste heat ====\n{{Main|Heat generation in integrated circuits}}{{See also|Thermal management (electronics)|Thermal design power|label 1=Thermal management in electronics}}\nSoC designs are optimized to minimize [[waste heat]] [[dissipation|output]] on the chip.  As with other [[integrated circuit]]s, heat generated due to high [[power density]] are the [[Bottleneck (engineering)|bottleneck]] to further [[miniaturization]] of components.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Heat Management in Integrated circuits: On-chip and system-level monitoring and cooling|last=Ogrenci-Memik|first=Seda|publisher=The Institution of Engineering and Technology|year=2015|isbn=9781849199353|location=London, United Kingdom|pages=|oclc=934678500}}</ref>{{Rp|1}}  The power densities of high speed integrated circuits, particularly microprocessors and including SoCs, have become highly uneven.  Too much waste heat can damage circuits and erode [[Reliability (semiconductor)|reliability]] of the circuit over time.  High temperatures and thermal stress negatively impact reliability, [[stress migration]], decreased [[mean time between failures]], [[electromigration]], [[wire bonding]], [[Metastability (electronics)|metastability]] and other performance degradation of the SoC over time.<ref name=\":2\" />{{Rp|2\u20139}}\n\nIn particular, most SoCs are in a small physical area or volume and therefore the effects of waste heat are compounded because there is little room for it to diffuse out of the system.  Because of high [[transistor count]]s on modern devices due to [[Moore's law]], oftentimes a layout of sufficient throughput and high [[Transistors density|transistor density]] is physically realizable from [[Semiconductor device fabrication|fabrication processes]] but would result in unacceptably high amounts of heat in the circuit's volume.<ref name=\":2\" />{{Rp|1}}\n\nThese thermal effects force SoC and other chip designers to apply conservative [[design margin]]s, creating less performant devices to mitigate the risk of [[catastrophic failure]].  Due to increased [[Transistors density|transistor densities]] as length scales get smaller, each [[Semiconductor node|process generation]] produces more heat output than the last.  Compounding this problem, system-on-chip architectures are usually heterogeneous, creating spatially inhomogeneous [[heat flux]]es, which cannot be effectively mitigated by uniform [[passive cooling]].<ref name=\":2\" />{{Rp|1}}\n\n==== Throughput ====\n{{Expand section|date=October 2018}}\nSoCs are optimized to maximize computational and communications [[throughput]].\n\n==== Latency ====\n{{Expand section|date=October 2018}}\nSoCs are optimized to minimize [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] for some or all of their functions.  This can be accomplished by [[Integrated circuit layout|laying out]] elements with proper proximity and [[Locality of reference|locality]] to each-other to minimize the interconnection delays and maximize the speed at which data is communicated between modules, [[Execution unit|functional units]] and memories.  In general, optimizing to minimize latency is an [[NP-completeness|NP-complete]] problem equivalent to the [[boolean satisfiability problem]].\n\nFor [[Task (computing)|tasks]] running on processor cores, latency and throughput can be improved with [[Scheduling (computing)|task scheduling]].  Some tasks run in application-specific hardware units, however, and even task scheduling may not be sufficient to optimize all software-based tasks to meet timing and throughput constraints.\n\n=== Methodologies ===\n{{Further|Multi-objective optimization|Multiple-criteria decision analysis|Architecture tradeoff analysis method|label3=Architecture tradeoff analysis}}\n{{Expand section|date=October 2018|small=no}}\nSystems on chip are modeled with standard hardware [[verification and validation]] techniques, but additional techniques are used to model and optimize SoC design alternatives to make the system optimal with respect to [[multiple-criteria decision analysis]] on the above optimization targets.\n\n==== Task scheduling ====\n[[Scheduling (computing)|Task scheduling]] is an important activity in any computer system with multiple [[Process (computing)|processes]] or [[Thread (computing)|threads]] sharing a single processor core.  It is important to reduce {{Section link||Latency|nopage=y}} and increase {{Section link||Throughput|nopage=y}} for [[embedded software]] running on an SoC's {{Section link||Processor cores|nopage=y}}.  Not every important computing activity in a system-on-chip is performed in software running on on-chip processors, but scheduling can drastically improve performance of software-based tasks and other tasks involving [[shared resource]]s.\n\nSoCs often schedule tasks according to [[network scheduling]] and [[Stochastic scheduling|randomized scheduling]] algorithms.\n\n==== Pipelining ====\n{{Broader|Pipeline (computing)}}\nHardware and software tasks are often pipelined in [[processor design]].  Pipelining is an important principle for [[speedup]] in [[computer architecture]].  They are frequently used in [[GPU]]s ([[graphics pipeline]]) and RISC processors (evolutions of the [[classic RISC pipeline]]), but are also applied to application-specific tasks such as [[digital signal processing]] and multimedia manipulations in the context of systems-on-chip.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Probabilistic modeling ====\nSystems-on-chip are often analyzed though [[probabilistic model]]s, {{Section link|Queueing theory|Queueing networks}} and [[Markov chain]]s.  For instance, [[Little's law]] allows SoC states and NoC buffers to be modeled as arrival processes and analyzed through [[Poisson random variable]]s and [[Poisson process]]es.\n\n==== Markov chains ====\nSoCs are often modeled with [[Markov chain]]s, both [[Markov chain#Discrete-time Markov chain|discrete time]] and [[Markov chain#Continuous-time Markov chain|continuous time]] variants.  Markov chain modeling allows [[asymptotic analysis]] of the system-on-chip's [[Markov chain#Steady-state analysis and limiting distributions|steady state distribution]] of power, heat, latency and other factors to allow design decisions to be optimized for the common case.\n\n== Fabrication ==\n{{Ref improve section|date=March 2017}}{{See|Semiconductor device fabrication}}\n\nSoC chips are typically [[semiconductor device fabrication|fabricated]] using [[metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor]] (MOS) technology.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lin |first1=Youn-Long Steve |title=Essential Issues in SOC Design: Designing Complex Systems-on-Chip |date=2007 |publisher=[[Springer Science & Business Media]] |isbn=9781402053528 |page=176 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7OV9lEn9LiQC&pg=PA176}}</ref> The netlists described above are used as the basis for the physical design ([[place and route]]) flow to convert the designers' intent into the design of the SoC.  Throughout this conversion process, the design is analyzed with static timing modeling, simulation and other tools to ensure that it meets the specified operational parameters such as frequency, power consumption and dissipation, functional integrity (as described in the register transfer level code) and electrical integrity.\n\nWhen all known bugs have been rectified and these have been re-verified and all physical design checks are done, the physical design files describing each layer of the chip are sent to the foundry's mask shop where a full set of glass lithographic masks will be etched.  These are sent to a wafer fabrication plant to create the SoC dice before packaging and testing.\n\nSoCs can be fabricated by several technologies, including:\n\n* [[Full custom]] ASIC\n* [[Standard cell]] ASIC\n* [[Field-programmable gate array]] (FPGA)\n\nASICs consume less power and are faster than FPGAs but cannot be reprogrammed and are expensive to manufacture. FPGA designs are more suitable for lower volume designs, but after enough units of production ASICs reduce the total cost of ownership.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://numato.com/blog/differences-between-fpga-and-asics/|title=FPGA vs ASIC: Differences between them and which one to use? \u2013 Numato Lab Help Center|website=numato.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-17}}</ref>\n\nSoC designs consume less power and have a lower cost and higher reliability than the multi-chip systems that they replace. With fewer packages in the system, assembly costs are reduced as well.\n\nHowever, like most [[very-large-scale integration]] (VLSI) designs, the total cost{{Clarify|reason=what kind of cost?|date=May 2018}} is higher for one large chip than for the same functionality distributed over several smaller chips, because of [[Semiconductor device fabrication#Device test|lower yields]]{{Clarify|reason=confusing to non-experts|date=May 2018}} and higher [[non-recurring engineering]] costs.\n\nWhen it is not feasible to construct an SoC for a particular application, an alternative is a [[system in package]] (SiP) comprising a number of chips in a single [[chip carrier|package]].  When produced in large volumes, SoC is more cost-effective than SiP because its packaging is simpler.<ref>[[EE Times]]. \"[http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1153043 The Great Debate: SOC vs. SIP].\" March 21, 2005.
