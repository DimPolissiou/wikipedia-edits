Since September 2010, train services operate from Docklands Station to M3 Parkway, with an extension to Navan itself proposed.\n\n== History ==\n===Background===\nNavan was originally a significant part of the expanding [[Rail transport in Ireland|rail network]] in [[Ireland]]. The [[Dublin and Drogheda Railway]] first constructed a branch from the [[Dublin-Belfast railway line|Dublin-Belfast main line]] through Navan to the town of [[Oldcastle, County Meath|Oldcastle]] which opened in 1850. In 1862, the Dublin and Meath Railway constructed and operated a branch from [[Clonsilla]] to Navan off the [[Midland Great Western Railway|MGWR]] main line to [[Sligo]]. This line was extended to [[Kingscourt railway station|Kingscourt]] in [[County Cavan]] in 1865, operated by the [[Navan and Kingscourt Railway]]. Both of these lines were eventually purchased by the MGWR, while the Oldcastle line was eventually incorporated into the [[Great Northern Railway (Ireland)|GNR(I)]]. [[Navan railway station]] itself was a small single platform stop on the Oldcastle line.<ref>[http://eiretrains.com/Photo_Gallery/Railway%20Stations%20N/Navan/IrishRailwayStations.html Navan station] - eiretrains.com</ref> The main station for the town was [[Navan Junction railway station|Navan Junction]], which had four platforms serving trains on both routes.<ref>[http://eiretrains.com/Photo_Gallery/Railway%20Stations%20N/Navan%20Junction/IrishRailwayStations.html Navan Junction station] - eiretrains.com</ref> \n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, there was a large scale rationalisation of the railway network in Ireland, which saw [[C\u00f3ras Iompair \u00c9ireann]] close large sections of line. Passenger services on the Kingscourt line were ended in 1947, while on the Oldcastle line they continued until 1958. The lines from Clonsilla and Oldcastle to Navan was lifted in 1963, with the remainder remaining open for freight use following the withdrawal of passenger services - the Gypsum Industries plant in Kingscourt utilised the line as far as Navan Junction before transferring to the Oldcastle line to transport [[gypsum]] to the Platin Cement Works just outside [[Drogheda]], while the [[Tara Mine]] also uses the Oldcastle branch to transport [[lead]] and [[zinc]]. Following industrial action by Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann train drivers in 2001, Gypsum freight services from Kingscourt were transferred to [[road haulage]], which led to the remainder of the line being mothballed. The line has been preserved however, with the then Minister for Public Enterprise, Mary O'Rourke TD, ordering Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann not to 'lift' the railway line, as it may be used in the future.\n\n===Initial proposal and opening to M3 Parkway===\nThe growth of the economy in [[County Meath]], added to the increase in the population of Navan,<ref>[http://www.cso.ie/census/documents/census2006_volume_1_pop_classified_by_area.pdf Census 2006 \u2013 Volume 1 \u2013 Population Classified by Area] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717202529/http://www.cso.ie/census/documents/census2006_volume_1_pop_classified_by_area.pdf |date=17 July 2011 }}</ref> has led to calls over the past few years for a rail service to be reinstated from Dublin. \n\nAs part of the [[Transport 21]] plan announced by the [[Irish Government]] in 2005, the line to Navan would be rebuilt in two phases as a branch of the [[Dublin Suburban Rail|Western Commuter]] line. The first phase would see a 7.5&nbsp;km stretch from the junction west of [[Clonsilla railway station|Clonsilla]]. This would feature three new railway stations at [[Hansfield railway station|Hansfield]], [[Dunboyne]] and [[park and ride]] interchange called [[M3 Parkway railway station|M3 Parkway]].

{"title_page": "Food bank", "text_new": "{{short description|Non-profit, charitable organization that distributes food}}\n[[File:Passing out groceries.jpg|thumb|Volunteers pass out food items from a food pantry run by [[Feeding America]]]]\nA '''foodbank''' is a non-profit, [[charitable organization]] that distributes food to those who have difficulty purchasing enough to avoid hunger.\n\nSome food banks operate on the \"front line\" model, giving out food directly to the hungry, such as many European ones. Others operate on the \"warehouse\" model, supplying food to intermediaries like food pantries, [[soup kitchen]]s and other front-line organisations, such as in Nepal, North America and Australia.\n\n[[St. Mary's Food Bank Alliance|St. Mary's Food Bank]] was the world's first food bank, established in the US in 1967. Since then, many thousands have been set up all over the world. In Europe, which until recently had little need for food banks due to extensive welfare systems, their numbers grew rapidly after the [[2007\u20132008 world food price crisis|global increase in the price of food]] which began in late 2006, and especially after the [[financial crisis of 2007\u201308]] began to worsen economic conditions for those on low incomes.\n\nThe growth of food banks has been welcomed by commentators who see them as examples of an active, caring citizenship. Other academics and commentators have expressed concern that the rise of foodbanks may erode political support for welfare provision. Researchers have reported that in some cases food banks can be inefficient compared with state-run services, and that some people feel ashamed at having to use them.\n\n==Operational models==\n[[Image:Insidecafb.png|right|The warehouse of the [[Capital Area Food Bank]]|thumb]]\n\nWith thousands of food banks operating around the world, there are many different models.<ref name = \"globalFBhistory\"/>\n\nA major distinction between food banks is whether or not they operate on the \"front line\" model, giving out food directly to the hungry, or whether they operate with the \"[[warehouse]]\" model, supplying food to intermediaries like food pantries, soup kitchens and other front-line organisations.<ref>These organisations can be private or public, religious or secular. The type and nature of the recipient agency varies depending upon the policies of the food bank, the nature of their community, and the local laws where they operate.</ref> In the US, Australia and to an extent in Canada, the standard model is for food banks to act as warehouses rather than as suppliers to the end user, though there are exceptions. In other countries, food banks usually do hand out food parcels direct to hungry people, providing the service that in the US is offered by ''food pantries''.\n\nAnother distinction is between the charity model and the labour union model. At least in Canada and the US, food banks run by charities often place relatively more weight on the salvaging of food that would otherwise go to waste, and on encouraging [[Voluntarism (action)|voluntarism]], whereas those run by unions can place greater emphasis on feeding the hungry by any means available, on providing work for the unemployed, and on education, especially on explaining to users their civil rights.<ref name=\"welfareCrisis\">\n{{cite book|author=Graham Riches|title=Food banks and the welfare crisis|chapter=''passim'', see esp. Models of Food Banks|year=1986|isbn=0888103638|publisher=Lorimer}}</ref>\n\nIn the US, cities will often have a single food bank which acts as a centralized warehouse and will serve several hundred front line agencies. Like a [[blood bank]], that warehouse serves as a single collection and distribution point for food donations. A food bank operates a lot like a for-profit food distributor, but in this case it distributes food to charities, not to food retailers. There is often no charge to the charities, but some food banks do charge a small \"shared maintenance\" fee  to help defray the cost of storage and distribution.\n\nFor many US food banks, most of their donated food comes from food left over from the normal processes of for-profit companies. It can come from any part of the food chain, e.g. from growers who have produced too much or whose food is not sufficiently visually appealing; from manufacturers who overproduced; or from retailers who over-ordered. Often the product is approaching or past its \"sell by\" date. In such cases, the food bank liaises with the food industry and with regulators to make sure the food is safe and legal to distribute and eat.\n\n[[File:US Navy 111123-N-HW977-185 Sailors weigh Thanksgiving food drive donations before delivery to the Corona-Norco Settlement House.jpg|thumb|Volunteers weigh food drive donations.]]\n\nOther sources of food include the general public, sometimes in the form of \"[[food drive]]s\", and government programs that buy and distribute excess farm products mostly to help support higher commodity prices. Food banks can also buy food either at market prices or from wholesalers and retailers at discounted prices, often at cost. Sometimes farmers will allow food banks to send [[Gleaning|gleaners]] to salvage leftover crops for free once their primary harvest is complete. A few food banks have even taken over their own farms, though such initiatives have not always been successful.<ref>{{cite book|author=Elizabeth Henderson and Robyn Van En|title=Sharing the Harvest: A Citizen's Guide to Community Supported Agriculture|publisher=Chealsea Green Publishing|chapter=Chapt 19|year=1986|isbn=193339210X}}</ref>\n\nMany food banks don't accept fresh produce, preferring canned or packaged food due to health and safety concerns, though some have tried to change this as part of a growing worldwide awareness of the importance of nutrition. As an example, in 2012, London Food Bank (Canada) started accepting perishable food, reporting that as well as the obvious health benefits, there were noticeable emotional benefits to recipients when they were given fresh food.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lfpress.com/news/columnists/ian_gillespie/2012/07/17/19997971.html|title=How to produce results|publisher=London Free Press|author=Ian Gillespie|date=17 July 2012|access-date=18 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nSummer can be a challenging time for food banks, especially in regions where school children are usually given regular free meals during term time. Spikes in demand can coincide with periods where donations fall due to folk being on holiday.<ref>{{cite web|title=Students swell summer demand for food banks|url=http://www.canada.com/Students+swell+summer+demand+food+banks/6915467/story.html|author=Lexi Bainas|date=11 July 2012|work=Canada.com|access-date=12 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suffolknewsherald.com/2012/07/11/food-banks-struggle-during-summer/|title=Food banks struggle during summer|author=Tracy Agnew|date=11 July 2012|work=Suffolk news herald|access-date=12 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n==North America==\n\n===History===\n[[File:US Navy 090806-N-6220J-004 Sailors and Navy Delayed Entry Program members serve breakfast to homeless men and women at Dorothy's Soup Kitchen in Salinas, Calif. during Salinas Navy Week community service event.jpg|thumb|left| In the U.S. and sometimes in Canada, food banks don't typically give food direct to the hungry.

Instead they act as warehouses, supplying front-line agencies like this Californian [[soup kitchen]]. (Picture taken in 2009, and shows members of the [[United States Navy]] serving visitors.)\nThe world's first food bank was [[St. Mary's Food Bank Alliance|St. Mary's Food Bank]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], founded by [[John van Hengel]] in 1967.<ref name=\"globalFBhistory\"/> According to sociology professor Janet Poppendieck, hunger within the US was widely considered to be a solved problem until the mid-1960s.<ref name=\"sweet\">{{cite book|author=Janet Poppendieck|title=Sweet Charity?: Emergency Food and the End of Entitlement|chapter=Introduction, Chpt 1|year=1999|isbn=0140245561|publisher=Penguine}}</ref> By the mid-sixties, several states had ended the free distribution of [[Federal Surplus Relief Corporation|federal food surpluses]], instead providing an early form of food stamps which had the benefit of allowing recipients to choose food of their liking, rather than having to accept whatever happened to be in surplus at the time. However, there was a minimum charge and some people could not afford the stamps, leading to severe hunger.<ref name = \"sweet\"/> One response from American society to the rediscovery of hunger was to step up the support provided by [[soup kitchen]]s and similar civil society food relief agencies \u2013 some of these dated back to the [[Great Depression]] and earlier. In 1965, while volunteering for a community dining room, van Hengel learned that grocery stores often had to throw away food that had damaged packaging or was near expiration. He started collecting that food for the dining room but soon had too much for that one program. He thought of creating a central location from which any agency can receive donations. Described as a classic case of \"if you build it they will come\",<ref>{{cite book|author=Leslie Crutchfield and Heather McLeod Grant|title=Forces for Good: The Six Practices of High-Impact Nonprofits|chapter=Chpt 3|year=2007|isbn=978-0470580349|publisher=Jossey-Bass}}</ref> the first food bank was created with the help of [[St. Mary's Basilica, Phoenix|St. Mary's Basilica]], which became the namesake of the organization.<ref>[http://www.firstfoodbank.org/history.html History of St. Mary's Food Bank Alliance] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204020809/http://www.firstfoodbank.org/history.html |date=February 4, 2010 }}</ref> Food banks spread across the United States, and to Canada. By 1976, van Hengel had established the organization known today as [[Feeding America]]. As of the early 21st century, their network of over 200 food banks provides support for 90,000 projects. Other large networks exist such as AmpleHarvest.org, created by [[www.AmpleHarvest.org/CNN|CNN Hero]] and World Food Prize nominee Gary Oppenheimer which lists more than 8,200 food pantries (1 out of every 5 in America) across all 50 states that can utilize [[overproduction]] of fresh produce.<ref name=\"sweet\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ampleharvest.org/ |title=AmpleHarvest.org homepage |publisher=AmpleHarvest.org |date=2010-05-17 |access-date=2013-10-25}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, U.S. food banks began to grow rapidly. A second response to the \"rediscovery\" of hunger in the mid-sixties had been extensive lobbying of politicians to improve welfare. Until the 1980s, this approach had greater impact.<ref name = \"sweet\"/> In the 1970s, U.S. federal expenditure on hunger relief grew by about 500%, with food stamps distributed free of charge to those in greatest need. According to Poppendieck, welfare was widely considered preferable to grass roots efforts, as the latter could be unreliable, did not give recipients consumer-style choice in the same way as did food stamps, and risked recipients feeling humiliated by having to turn to charity. In the early 1980s, [[Ronald Reagan|president Reagan]]'s administration scaled back welfare provision, leading to a rapid rise in activity from grass roots hunger relief agencies.

The programme involved the EU buying surplus agricultural products, which were then distributed to the poor largely by Catholic churches. The MDP was wound down in late-2013, and was replaced by  ''Fund for European aid for the most deprived'' (FEAD), which is set to run until at least 2020.

They operate on the \"frontline\" model, giving out food directly to the hungry. Over 90% of the food given out is donated by the public, including schools, churches, businesses and individuals. The Trussell Trust had aimed to provide short-term support for people whose needs have not yet been addressed by official state welfare provision; those who had been \"falling into the cracks in the system\". The Trussell franchise has procedures which aim to prevent long-term dependency on their services, and to ensure that those in need are referred to qualified outside agencies. The charity suggests that the ''credit crunch'' caused an upsurge in the number of people needing emergency food. Since 2010, demand for foodbanks continued to increase, and at a more rapid rate, partly as [[United Kingdom government austerity programme|austerity]] began to take effect, and partly as those on low incomes began to draw down savings and run out of friends of whom they were willing to ask for help. Unlike ''soup kitchens'',{{efn|Soup kitchens will typically feed anyone if they have food available, but they can often only provide a single meal.

Vouchers are handed out to those in need by various sorts of frontline care professionals, such as [[social workers]], health visitors, [[Citizens Advice Bureau]]x, [[Jobcentre]]s and housing officials. The voucher can typically be exchanged at the food bank for a package of food sufficient to last three days.

Drawing on the United States's experience after the rapid rise of food banks in the 1980s, American sociology professor Janet Poppendieck warned that the rise of food banks can contribute to a long-term erosion of human rights and support for entitlements. Once food banks become well established, it can be politically impossible to return responsibility for meeting the needs of hungry people to the state. Poppendieck says that the logistics of running food banks can be so demanding that they prevent kind-hearted people from having time to participate in public policy advocacy; yet she also says if they can be encouraged to lobby politicians for long-term changes that would help those on low income, they often have considerable credibility with legislators. As of 2012, senior US food banks workers have expressed a preference to remain politically neutral, which political activists have suggested may relate to their sources of funding.<ref name = \"WarwickConf\"/><ref name=\"Lambeth\"/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/09/giving/food-banks-mission-expands-to-nutrition-and-education.html?_r=0|title=Food Banks Expand Beyond Hunger|work=The New York Times|author=Phyllis Korrki|date=2012-11-08|access-date=2012-11-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/rowenna-davis/2012/12/truth-about-food-banks-new-reality-working-poor|title=How food banks became mainstream: the new reality of the working poor|publisher=[[New Statesman]]|author=Rowenna Davis|date=2012-12-17|access-date=2013-02-23|author-link=Rowenna Davis}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/dec/18/food-banks-parliamentary-debate-scandal|title=Let's debate our need for food banks \u2013 a national disgrace|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|author=Jack Monroe|date=2013-12-18|access-date= 2014-01-17|author-link=Jack Monroe}}</ref>\n\nThe emergence of \"Little Free Food Pantries\" and \"Blessing Boxes,\" modeled on the \"[[Little Free Library|Little Free Libraries]]\" boxes, has been criticized as feel-good local philanthropy which is too small to make a significant impact on hunger, for its lack of access to fresh foods, for food safety concerns, and as a public relations effort by [[Tyson Foods]], which seeks to cut federal [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|SNAP]] food assistance in the US.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.citylab.com/equity/2017/07/little-free-pantry/534468/|title=What's Wrong With DIY Food Pantries|last=Capps|first=Kriston|date=July 25, 2017|website=CityLab|language=en|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref>\n\nRachel Loopstra from [[University of Toronto]] has said foodbanks are often inefficient, unreliable and unable to supply nutritional food.

Others operate on the \"warehouse\" model, supplying food to intermediaries like food pantries, [[soup kitchen]]s and other front-line organisations, such as in Nepal, North America and Australia.\n\n[[St. Mary's Food Bank Alliance|St. Mary's Food Bank]] was the world's first food bank, established in the US in 1967. Since then, many thousands have been set up all over the world. In Europe, which until recently had little need for food banks due to extensive welfare systems, their numbers grew rapidly after the [[2007\u20132008 world food price crisis|global increase in the price of food]] which began in late 2006, and especially after the [[financial crisis of 2007\u201308]] began to worsen economic conditions for those on low incomes.\n\nThe growth of food banks has been welcomed by commentators who see them as examples of an active, caring citizenship. Other academics and commentators have expressed concern that the rise of foodbanks may erode political support for welfare provision. Researchers have reported that in some cases food banks can be inefficient compared with state-run services, and that some people feel ashamed at having to use them.\n\n==Operational models==\n[[Image:Insidecafb.png|right|The warehouse of the [[Capital Area Food Bank]]|thumb]]\n\nWith thousands of food banks operating around the world, there are many different models.<ref name = \"globalFBhistory\"/>\n\nA major distinction between food banks is whether or not they operate on the \"front line\" model, giving out food directly to the hungry, or whether they operate with the \"[[warehouse]]\" model, supplying food to intermediaries like food pantries, soup kitchens and other front-line organisations.<ref>These organisations can be private or public, religious or secular. The type and nature of the recipient agency varies depending upon the policies of the food bank, the nature of their community, and the local laws where they operate.</ref> In the US, Australia and to an extent in Canada, the standard model is for food banks to act as warehouses rather than as suppliers to the end user, though there are exceptions. In other countries, food banks usually do hand out food parcels direct to hungry people, providing the service that in the US is offered by ''food pantries''.\n\nAnother distinction is between the charity model and the labour union model. At least in Canada and the US, food banks run by charities often place relatively more weight on the salvaging of food that would otherwise go to waste, and on encouraging [[Voluntarism (action)|voluntarism]], whereas those run by unions can place greater emphasis on feeding the hungry by any means available, on providing work for the unemployed, and on education, especially on explaining to users their civil rights.<ref name=\"welfareCrisis\">\n{{cite book|author=Graham Riches|title=Food banks and the welfare crisis|chapter=''passim'', see esp. Models of Food Banks|year=1986|isbn=0888103638|publisher=Lorimer}}</ref>\n\nIn the US, cities will often have a single food bank which acts as a centralized warehouse and will serve several hundred front line agencies. Like a [[blood bank]], that warehouse serves as a single collection and distribution point for food donations. A food bank operates a lot like a for-profit food distributor, but in this case it distributes food to charities, not to food retailers. There is often no charge to the charities, but some food banks do charge a small \"shared maintenance\" fee  to help defray the cost of storage and distribution.\n\nFor many US food banks, most of their donated food comes from food left over from the normal processes of for-profit companies. It can come from any part of the food chain, e.g. from growers who have produced too much or whose food is not sufficiently visually appealing; from manufacturers who overproduced; or from retailers who over-ordered. Often the product is approaching or past its \"sell by\" date. In such cases, the food bank liaises with the food industry and with regulators to make sure the food is safe and legal to distribute and eat.\n\n[[File:US Navy 111123-N-HW977-185 Sailors weigh Thanksgiving food drive donations before delivery to the Corona-Norco Settlement House.jpg|thumb|Volunteers weigh food drive donations.]]\n\nOther sources of food include the general public, sometimes in the form of \"[[food drive]]s\", and government programs that buy and distribute excess farm products mostly to help support higher commodity prices. Food banks can also buy food either at market prices or from wholesalers and retailers at discounted prices, often at cost. Sometimes farmers will allow food banks to send [[Gleaning|gleaners]] to salvage leftover crops for free once their primary harvest is complete. A few food banks have even taken over their own farms, though such initiatives have not always been successful.<ref>{{cite book|author=Elizabeth Henderson and Robyn Van En|title=Sharing the Harvest: A Citizen's Guide to Community Supported Agriculture|publisher=Chealsea Green Publishing|chapter=Chapt 19|year=1986|isbn=193339210X}}</ref>\n\nMany food banks don't accept fresh produce, preferring canned or packaged food due to health and safety concerns, though some have tried to change this as part of a growing worldwide awareness of the importance of nutrition. As an example, in 2012, London Food Bank (Canada) started accepting perishable food, reporting that as well as the obvious health benefits, there were noticeable emotional benefits to recipients when they were given fresh food.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lfpress.com/news/columnists/ian_gillespie/2012/07/17/19997971.html|title=How to produce results|publisher=London Free Press|author=Ian Gillespie|date=17 July 2012|access-date=18 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nSummer can be a challenging time for food banks, especially in regions where school children are usually given regular free meals during term time.

However, there was a minimum charge and some people could not afford the stamps, leading to severe hunger.<ref name = \"sweet\"/> One response from American society to the rediscovery of hunger was to step up the support provided by [[soup kitchen]]s and similar civil society food relief agencies \u2013 some of these dated back to the [[Great Depression]] and earlier. In 1965, while volunteering for a community dining room, van Hengel learned that grocery stores often had to throw away food that had damaged packaging or was near expiration. He started collecting that food for the dining room but soon had too much for that one program. He thought of creating a central location from which any agency can receive donations.

By 1976, van Hengel had established the organization known today as [[Feeding America]]. As of the early 21st century, their network of over 200 food banks provides support for 90,000 projects. Other large networks exist such as [http://www.AmpleHarvest.org/ AmpleHarvest.org], created by [[www.AmpleHarvest.org/CNN|CNN Hero]] and World Food Prize nominee Gary Oppenheimer which lists more than 8,200 food pantries (1 out of every 5 in America) across all 50 states that can utilize [[overproduction]] of fresh produce.<ref name=\"sweet\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ampleharvest.org/ |title=AmpleHarvest.org homepage |publisher=AmpleHarvest.org |date=2010-05-17 |access-date=2013-10-25}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, U.S. food banks began to grow rapidly. A second response to the \"rediscovery\" of hunger in the mid-sixties had been extensive lobbying of politicians to improve welfare. Until the 1980s, this approach had greater impact.<ref name = \"sweet\"/> In the 1970s, U.S. federal expenditure on hunger relief grew by about 500%, with food stamps distributed free of charge to those in greatest need. According to Poppendieck, welfare was widely considered preferable to grass roots efforts, as the latter could be unreliable, did not give recipients consumer-style choice in the same way as did food stamps, and risked recipients feeling humiliated by having to turn to charity. In the early 1980s, [[Ronald Reagan|president Reagan]]'s administration scaled back welfare provision, leading to a rapid rise in activity from grass roots hunger relief agencies. According to a comprehensive government survey completed in 2002, over 90% of food banks were established in the US after 1981.<ref name=\"sweet\"/><ref name=\"walter\">{{cite book|editor=William A Dando|author=Andrew Walter|title=Food and Famine in the 21st Century|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|pages=171\u2013181|year=2012|isbn=978-1-59884-730-7}}</ref> Poppendieck says that for the first few years after the change, there was vigorous opposition from the left, who argued that state welfare was much more suitable for meeting recipients needs.

The programme involved the EU buying surplus agricultural products, which were then distributed to the poor largely by Catholic churches. The MDP was wound down in late-2013, and was replaced by  ''Fund for European aid for the most deprived'' (FEAD), which is set to run until at least 2020. The FEAD programme has a wider scope than the MDP, helping deprived people not just with food aid, but with social inclusion projects and housing. The actual methods employed by FEAD tend to vary from country to country, but in several EU states, such as Poland, its activities include helping to fund local food bank networks.<ref name=\"WarwickConf\">{{cite news|url=http://www.warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/gpp/foodsecurity/publicevents/householdfoodsecurity/food_security_summary.pdf |title=Household food security in the global north: challenges and responsibilities|publisher=[[Warwick University]] |date=2012-07-06 |accessdate=2012-08-23|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130112230035/http://www.warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/gpp/foodsecurity/publicevents/householdfoodsecurity/food_security_summary.pdf |archivedate=January 12, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/most-deprived-persons/index_en.htm|title=Free food for the most deprived persons in the EU (published by the European Commission)|publisher=Ec.europa.eu|date= |accessdate=2013-10-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-12-800_en.htm|title=Poverty: Commission proposes new fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived - frequently asked questions (European Commission press release)|publisher=Europa.eu|date=|accessdate=2013-10-25}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite book \n|author = Graham Riches\n|title=Food Bank Nations\n|chapter = 3, 5\n|year= 2018\n|isbn=978-1138739758\n|publisher= [[Routledge]]\n}}</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\nResearch published in 2017 found there were over 2,000 UK food banks, with 651 being independent of the Trussell network.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/may/29/report-reveals-scale-of-food-bank-use-in-the-uk-ifan|title=Report reveals scale of food bank use in the UK|author=Patrick Butler|date=2017-05-29|website=|publisher=The Guardian|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-06-05}}</ref>\n\nProfessor Jon May, of [[Queen Mary University of London]] and the Independent Food Aid Network, said statistics showed rapid rise in numbers of food banks during the last five years. \n{{quote|\u201cThere are now food banks in almost every community, from the [[East End of London]] to the [[Cotswolds]].

They operate on the \"frontline\" model, giving out food directly to the hungry. Over 90% of the food given out is donated by the public, including schools, churches, businesses and individuals. The Trussell Trust had aimed to provide short-term support for people whose needs have not yet been addressed by official state welfare provision; those who had been \"falling into the cracks in the system\". The Trussell franchise has procedures which aim to prevent long-term dependency on their services, and to ensure that those in need are referred to qualified outside agencies. The charity suggests that the ''credit crunch'' caused an upsurge in the number of people needing emergency food. Since 2010, demand for foodbanks continued to increase, and at a more rapid rate, partly as [[United Kingdom government austerity programme|austerity]] began to take effect, and partly as those on low incomes began to draw down savings and run out of friends of whom they were willing to ask for help. Unlike ''soup kitchens'',{{efn|Soup kitchens will typically feed anyone if they have food available, but they can often only provide a single meal. A food bank on the other hand will typically give a package of food sufficient to last for several days.{{fact|date=December 2019}}}} most, but not all UK food banks are unable to help people who come in off the street without a referral - instead they operate with a referral system. Vouchers are handed out to those in need by various sorts of frontline care professionals, such as [[social workers]], health visitors, [[Citizens Advice Bureau]]x, [[Jobcentre]]s and housing officials. The voucher can typically be exchanged at the food bank for a package of food sufficient to last three days.

Food banks in those areas can buy large amounts of food shortly after the harvest, and then as food prices start to rise, they sell it back to local people throughout the year at well below market prices.

Not only do they provide a solution to the problem of hunger that doesn't require resources from the state, but they can be viewed as evidence of increasing community spirit and of active, caring citizenship. In the UK for example, Patrick Butler, society editor for ''[[The Guardian]]'', has written that the rise of foodbanks has been most enthusiastically welcomed by the right, but also by many on the left of the political spectrum, who were often \"nervously excited\" about them.<ref name=\"Lambeth\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/21/food-banks-lambeth-council|title=Food banks: Lambeth holds its breath, and its nose|publisher=The Guardian|author=Patrick Butler|date=2012-08-21|access-date=2012-08-23}}</ref> However, there has been considerable concern expressed by some researchers and politicians. Drawing on the United States's experience after the rapid rise of food banks in the 1980s, American sociology professor Janet Poppendieck warned that the rise of food banks can contribute to a long-term erosion of human rights and support for entitlements. Once food banks become well established, it can be politically impossible to return responsibility for meeting the needs of hungry people to the state. Poppendieck says that the logistics of running food banks can be so demanding that they prevent kind-hearted people from having time to participate in public policy advocacy; yet she also says if they can be encouraged to lobby politicians for long-term changes that would help those on low income, they often have considerable credibility with legislators. As of 2012, senior US food banks workers have expressed a preference to remain politically neutral, which political activists have suggested may relate to their sources of funding.<ref name = \"WarwickConf\"/><ref name=\"Lambeth\"/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/09/giving/food-banks-mission-expands-to-nutrition-and-education.html?_r=0|title=Food Banks Expand Beyond Hunger|work=The New York Times|author=Phyllis Korrki|date=2012-11-08|access-date=2012-11-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/rowenna-davis/2012/12/truth-about-food-banks-new-reality-working-poor|title=How food banks became mainstream: the new reality of the working poor|publisher=[[New Statesman]]|author=Rowenna Davis|date=2012-12-17|access-date=2013-02-23|author-link=Rowenna Davis}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/dec/18/food-banks-parliamentary-debate-scandal|title=Let's debate our need for food banks \u2013 a national disgrace|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|author=Jack Monroe|date=2013-12-18|access-date= 2014-01-17|author-link=Jack Monroe}}</ref>\n\nThe emergence of \"Little Free Food Pantries\" and \"Blessing Boxes,\" modeled on the \"[[Little Free Library|Little Free Libraries]]\" boxes, has been criticized as feel-good local philanthropy which is too small to make a significant impact on hunger, for its lack of access to fresh foods, for food safety concerns, and as a public relations effort by [[Tyson Foods]], which seeks to cut federal [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|SNAP]] food assistance in the US.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.citylab.com/equity/2017/07/little-free-pantry/534468/|title=What's Wrong With DIY Food Pantries|last=Capps|first=Kriston|date=July 25, 2017|website=CityLab|language=en|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref>\n\nRachel Loopstra from [[University of Toronto]] has said foodbanks are often inefficient, unreliable and unable to supply nutritional food.
