Commissioned in 1934, she was one of the most decorated ships of [[World War II]], [[Most decorated US ships of World War II|earning 17 battle stars]].\n\nLike most of her [[sister ship]]s, she saw extensive action during the [[Guadalcanal campaign]], including the [[Battle of Cape Esperance]] and the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]], during which she was heavily damaged and her captain and admiral killed. Earlier in the battle she mistakenly fired on the light cruiser {{USS|Atlanta|CL-51|2}}, causing serious damage and inflicting numerous casualties.\n\nDecommissioned immediately after the end of the war, she was sold for scrap in 1959.\n\nHer [[bridge wing]]s, damaged during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal and removed during repairs, are now mounted on a promontory in [[Golden Gate National Recreation Area]]. They are set on the [[great circle]] course from [[San Francisco]] to [[Guadalcanal]].\n\n==Construction and commissioning==\n''San Francisco'' was [[laid down]] on 9 September 1931 at the [[Mare Island Navy Yard]], [[Vallejo, California]] under the supervision of Naval constructor [[Charles W. Fisher Jr.]]; [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 9 March 1933; sponsored by Miss Barbara M. Bailly; and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 10 February 1934, [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Royal E. Ingersoll]] in command.\n\nThe ''New Orleans''-class cruisers were the last U.S. cruisers built to the specifications and standards of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922.  Such ships, with a limit of 10,000 tons standard displacement and 8-inch caliber main guns may be referred to as \"treaty cruisers.\" Originally classified as a [[light cruiser]] before she was laid down due to her thin armor, she was reclassified as a [[heavy cruiser]] because of her 8-inch guns. The term \"heavy cruiser\" was not defined until the [[London Naval Treaty]] in 1930.\n\n==Inter-war period==\nAfter an extensive shakedown cruise \u2013 which included operations off [[Mexico]], in Hawaiian waters, off [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[British Columbia]], and a voyage to the [[Panama Canal Zone]] \u2014 the cruiser returned to the Mare Island Navy Yard. Gunnery installation and conversion to a flagship took her into 1935. In February, she joined Cruiser Division 6 (Crudiv 6) at [[San Diego]]. In May, she moved north and participated in [[Fleet Problem XVI]], then returned to southern [[California]]. A few weeks later, she was back off the northwest coast for fleet tactics, and in July, she steamed farther north to [[Alaska]]. In August, she returned to California and, through the end of 1938, San Francisco continued to range the eastern Pacific, cruising from the state of Washington to [[Peru]] and from California to [[Hawaii]].\n\nIn January 1939, she departed the west coast to participate in [[Fleet Problem XX]], conducted in the Atlantic east of the [[Lesser Antilles]]. In March, she became flagship of CruDiv 7 and commenced a goodwill tour of South American ports. Departing [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]] in early April, she called at ports on the east coast of that continent, moved through the [[Strait of Magellan]] and visited west coast ports, then in early June, transited the [[Panama Canal]] to complete her voyage around the continent.\n\n==World War II==\nOn 1 September 1939, [[World War II]] started, and on 14 September, ''San Francisco'' moved south from [[Naval Station Norfolk]] to join the [[Neutrality Patrol]]. The cruiser carried freight and passengers to [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], thence sailed for a patrol of the [[West Indies]] as far south as [[Trinidad]]. On 14 October, she completed her patrol back at San Juan and headed for Norfolk, where she remained into January 1940. On 11 January, she headed for Guantanamo Bay, where she was relieved as flagship by {{USS|Wichita|CA-45|2}}, where she returned to the Pacific.\n\nTransiting the Panama Canal in late February, she called at San Pedro and, in March, continued on to her new home port, [[Pearl Harbor]], where she rejoined CruDiv 6. In May 1940, she steamed northwest to the [[Puget Sound Navy Yard]] for an overhaul, during which she also received four {{convert|3|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns. On 29 September, she returned to Pearl Harbor. In early May 1941, she became flagship of CruDiv 6; and, at the end of July, she moved east for a cruise to [[Long Beach, California]], returning to Hawaii on 27 August. In September, the flag of CruDiv 6 was hauled down; and on 11 October, ''San Francisco'' entered the [[Pearl Harbor Navy Yard]] for an overhaul which was scheduled for completion on 25 December.\n\n===Pearl Harbor attack===\nOn 7 December 1941, ''San Francisco'' was in Pearl Harbor awaiting docking and the cleaning of her heavily fouled bottom. Her engineering plant was largely broken down for overhaul. Ammunition for her {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}} and {{convert|8|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns had been placed in storage. Her {{convert|3|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns had been removed to permit installation of four {{convert|1.1|in|mm|abbr=on}} quadruple mounts, although the mounts had not yet been installed. Her {{convert|.50|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} [[machine gun]]s were being overhauled. Only small arms and two {{convert|.30|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} machine guns were available. Moreover, a number of ''San Francisco's'' officers and men were absent.\n\nAt 0755, Japanese planes began bombing dives on Battleship Row anchored near Ford Island. Off-duty signalman Ed Ifkin was relaxing on the signal bridge.  \n\n\"I was reading the newspaper I'd just bought at the kiosk on the wharf, when an airplane buzzed over my head with that big red meatball on its side.  I was trained to recognize foreign insignia and knew right away it was Japanese.  I telephoned down to the bridge and told the duty officer.  He said, 'Ifkin you'll go on report for horsing around,' when BOOM!  The first torpedo hit (USS) ''Oklahoma''.  Our guns were down, so a bunch of us climbed over to \"New Orleans.\"  It was berthed right next us.  We spent the next two hours feeding ammunition to the gunners.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kruth |first1=Gerald |title=Remembering San Francisco |journal=personal interview with veteran |date=February 7, 2011 |volume=i |issue=i.i |page=x}}</ref>\n  \nIfkin is now recognized as the first U.S.sailor to report the Japanese attack that completely shocked the American Navy and burst the nation into the World War.{cite: Kruth interview}\n\nBy 0800, the attack on Pearl Harbor was well underway. The men of San Francisco secured the ship for watertightness and began looking for opportunities to fight back. Some crossed to {{USS|New Orleans|CA-32|2}} to help man anti-aircraft batteries on that ship. Others began using available rifles and machine guns. Ammunition for {{convert|.50|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} machine guns was transferred to {{USS|Tracy|DD-214|2}} for use.\n\n\u201cWhen the Japanese left the entire harbor was a shambles,\u201d Iftkin recalled. \u201cThe fires; the oil in the water from the torpedoed ships .  .  . the \u201cArizona\u201d burned for two days.\u201d\n\n''San Francisco'' was not bombed or damaged during the Japanese air raid. After the attack was over, work resumed to make ''San Francisco'' seaworthy and combat-ready.\n\nOn 14 December, the cruiser left the yard; the scaling of her keel had been postponed in favor of more necessary repairs on other ships. On 16 December, she sortied with Task Force 14 (TF 14) to relieve [[Wake Island]]. The force moved west with a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] squadron onboard {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|2}} and a Marine [[battalion]] embarked in {{USS|Tangier|AV-8|2}}. However, when Wake Island fell to the Japanese on 23 December, TF 14 was diverted to [[Midway Atoll]] which it reinforced. On 29 December, the force returned to Pearl Harbor.\n\n===1942===\nOn 8 January 1942, ''San Francisco'' again moved west. In TF 8, she steamed toward [[Samoa]] to rendezvous with, and cover the off-loading of, transports carrying reinforcements to [[Tutuila]], Samoa. There, she joined [[Task Force 17]] for raids on Japanese installations in the [[Gilbert Islands|Gilbert]] and [[Marshall Islands]]. ''San Francisco'' arrived in the Samoan area on 18 January, and on the 24th was detached to continue coverage for the transports while the remainder of the task force and TF 17 conducted offensive operations to the northwest.\n\nOn 8 February, ''San Francisco'' departed from Tutuila. On the 10th, she rejoined CruDiv 6, then in TF 11, and she set a course for an area northeast of the [[Solomon Islands]] to strike [[Rabaul]]. However, the American force was sighted and attacked by two waves of [[Mitsubishi G4M]] \"Betty\" [[medium bomber]]s. Sixteen of the planes were destroyed, but since the element of surprise had been lost, TF 11 retired eastward.\n\nDuring the next few days, TF 11 \u2013 centered around {{USS|Lexington|CV-2|2}} \u2014 conducted operations in the [[South Pacific Area]], then headed for [[New Guinea]] to participate with TF 17 in a raid against Japanese shipping and installations.\n\nOn 7 March, one of ''San Francisco''{{'}}s scout planes was reported missing and could not be found.\n\nOn the night of 9\u201310 March, TFs 11 and 17 entered the [[Gulf of Papua]], whence, at dawn, ''Lexington'' and {{USS|Yorktown|CV-5|2}} launched their aircraft to cross the [[Owen Stanley Range]] and attack the Japanese at [[Salamaua]] and [[Lae]].\n\nThe next day, the missing plane was sighted by {{USS|Minneapolis|CA-36|2}} and recovered by ''San Francisco''. It had landed on the water, but had been unable to communicate. The pilot, [[Lieutenant]] J. A. Thomas, and the radioman, O. J. Gannan, had headed for [[Australia]], sailing the plane backwards as it tended to head into the prevailing east wind. In five days and 21 hours, they had covered approximately 385 miles (715&nbsp;km) on a course within 5 degrees of that intended.\n\n''San Francisco'' returned to Pearl Harbor on 26 March. On 22 April, the cruiser departed [[Oahu]] for San Francisco in the escort of convoy 4093. At the end of May, she headed west, escorting convoy PW 2076, made up of transports carrying the [[37th Infantry Division (United States)|37th Army Division]], destined for [[Suva]], and special troops bound for Australia. The cruiser remained in the escort force as far as [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]]. There she steamed for Hawaii, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 29 June.\n\n''San Francisco'' steamed west with {{USS|Laffey|DD-459|2}} and {{USS|Ballard|DD-267|2}} to escort convoy 4120 to the [[Fiji|Fiji Islands]]. From there, she got underway to rendezvous with the Solomon Islands Expeditionary Force.\n\n[[Operation Watchtower]] \u2014 the [[Guadalcanal]]-[[Tulagi]] offensive \u2013 opened on the morning of 7 August. Through that day and the remainder of the month, ''San Francisco'' helped to cover the American forces in the area. The flag of [[Rear admiral#United States|Rear Admiral]] [[Norman Scott (admiral)|Norman Scott]], commanding the cruisers attached to TF 18, was shifted to ''San Francisco''.\n\nOn 3 September, ''San Francisco''{{'}}s force put into [[Noum\u00e9a]], [[New Caledonia]], for fuel and provisions. On 8 September, the ships departed that island to cover reinforcements moving up to Guadalcanal. On the 11th, ''San Francisco''{{'}}s force, TF 18, rendezvoused with TF 17, the {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|2}} group, and the next day, both groups refueled at sea. On 14 September, the reinforcement convoy departed the [[New Hebrides]]. TF 61 commenced covering operations with TF 17, operating east of TF 18 and conforming to their movements.\n\nAt about 1450 on 15 September, {{USS|Wasp|CV-7|2}} was torpedoed on the starboard side. Fires broke out on the carrier. Explosions multiplied the fires. Admiral Scott took command of TF 18. ''San Francisco'' and {{USS|Salt Lake City|CA-25|2}} prepared to take the carrier in tow, but by 1520, the fires were out of control and destroyers began taking on survivors. {{USS|Lansdowne|DD-486|2}} torpedoed the burning hulk. TF 18 then headed for [[Espiritu Santo]].\n\nOn the morning of 17 September, ''San Francisco'', {{USS|Juneau|CL-52|2}}, and five destroyers put back to sea to rendezvous with TF 17 and resume coverage of reinforcement convoys. Other units of TF 18 had headed for Noum\u00e9a with ''Wasp'' survivors.\n\nOn 23 September, ''San Francisco'', ''Salt Lake City'', ''Minneapolis'', {{USS|Chester|CA-27|2}}, {{USS|Boise|CL-47|2}}, and {{USS|Helena|CL-50|2}}, and Destroyer Squadron 12 (DesRon 12) became TF 64, a surface screening and attack force under the command of Admiral Scott in ''San Francisco''. The next day, the force headed to the New Hebrides.\n\n====Battle of Cape Esperance====\n{{main|Battle of Cape Esperance}}\nOn 7 October 1942, TF 64 (minus ''Chester'' and ''Minneapolis'') departed from Espiritu Santo, the New Hebrides, and moved back into the Solomons to cover Allied reinforcements and to intercept similar operations by the Japanese. On 11 October, at about 1615, the ships commenced a run northward from Rennel Island, to intercept an enemy force of two cruisers and six destroyers reported heading for Guadalcanal from the Buin-Faisi, [[Bougainville Island]] area. The force continued north to approach [[Savo Island]] in [[The Slot]] from the southwest.\n\nBy 2330, when the warships were approximately {{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=on}} northwest of Savo Island, they turned to make a further search of the area. A few minutes after setting the new course, radar indicated unidentified ships to the west, several thousand yards distant. At about 2345, the Battle of Cape Esperance began.\n\nInitial confusion caused both sides to momentarily check their fire in fear of hitting their own ships. Then, the battle was reopened and continued until 0020 on 12 October, when surviving Japanese ships retired toward the [[Shortland Islands]]. ''Salt Lake City'', ''Boise'', {{USS|Duncan|DD-485|2}} and {{USS|Farenholt|DD-491|2}}, had been damaged. Later, ''Duncan'' went down. {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Furutaka||2}} and a destroyer had been sunk during the surface action. Two more enemy destroyers were sunk on 12 October by Marine planes from [[Henderson Field (Guadalcanal)|Henderson Field]]. After the engagement, TF 64 retired to Espiritu Santo.\n\nOn 15 October, ''San Francisco'' resumed operations in support of the Guadalcanal campaign. On the evening of 20 October, her group was ordered back to Espiritu Santo. At 2119, submarine's torpedoes were reported. ''Chester'' was hit amidships on the starboard side but continued under her own power. Three other torpedoes exploded: one off ''Helena''{{'}}s starboard quarter; a second between ''Helena'' and ''San Francisco''; and the third about {{convert|1200|yd|m|abbr=on}} off ''San Francisco''{{'}}s port beam. Two others were sighted running on the surface.\n\n''San Francisco'' reached Espiritu Santo on the night of 21 October, but departed again on 22 October to intercept any enemy surface units approaching Guadalcanal from the north and to cover friendly reinforcements. On 28 October, Admiral Scott transferred to ''Atlanta''. The next day, ''San Francisco'' returned to Espiritu Santo, and on 30 October, Rear Admiral [[Daniel J. Callaghan]], the commanding officer of ''San Francisco'' when the United States entered the war, returned to the ship and raised his flag as Commander, Task Group 64.4 (TG 64.4) and prospective TF 65.\n\n====Naval Battle of Guadalcanal====\n{{main|Naval Battle of Guadalcanal}}\nOn 31 October 1942, the newly designated TF 65 departed from Espiritu Santo, the ships again headed into the Solomon Islands to cover troop landings on Guadalcanal. Bombardment missions in the [[Kokumbona]] and [[Koli Point]] areas followed. On 6 November, the transport group completed unloading, and the force retired, arriving at Espiritu Santo on 8 November. On 10 November, ''San Francisco'', now flagship for TG 67.4, got underway again toward Guadalcanal.\n\nJust before noon, a Japanese twin-float reconnaissance plane began shadowing the formation.\n\nThe force arrived off [[Lunga Point]] on 12 November, and the transports commenced unloading. By mid-afternoon, an approaching Japanese air group was reported. At 1318, the ships got underway. At 1408, 21 enemy planes attacked.\n\n[[File:Japanes air attack on shipping off Guadalcanal, 12 November 1942.jpg|thumb|''San Francisco'' (center) after being hit by a Japanese plane in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, 12 November 1942. Ship at left is {{USS|President Jackson|AP-37|2}}.]]\n\nAt 1416, an already-damaged [[torpedo bomber]] dropped its torpedo off ''San Francisco''{{'}}s starboard quarter. The torpedo passed alongside, but the plane crashed into ''San Francisco''{{'}}s control aft, swung around that structure, and plunged over the port side into the sea. 15 men were killed, 29 wounded, and one missing. Control aft was demolished. The ship's secondary command post, Battle Two, was burned out but was reestablished by dark. The after anti-aircraft director and radar were put out of commission. Three 20&nbsp;mm mounts were destroyed.\n\nThe wounded were transferred to {{USS|President Jackson|AP-37|2}}, just before the approach of an enemy surface force was reported. The covering force escorted the transports out of the area, then reassembled and returned. At about midnight, ''San Francisco'', in company with heavy cruiser USS ''Portland'', the light cruisers ''Atlanta'', ''Helena'', and ''Juneau'', and eight destroyers, entered [[Lengo Channel]].\n\nAt 0125 on 13 November, a Japanese naval force was discovered about {{convert|27000|yd|m|abbr=on}} to the northwest. Rear Admiral Callaghan's task group maneuvered to intercept in what became the first engagement in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. At 0148, in almost pitch darkness, ''San Francisco'' opened fire on an enemy cruiser {{convert|3700|yd|m|abbr=on}} off her starboard beam. At 0151, she trained her guns on a small cruiser or large destroyer {{convert|3300|yd|m|abbr=on}} off her starboard bow. Then in an attempt to locate other targets, ''San Francisco'' accidentally targeted {{USS|Atlanta|CL-51|2}}. ''San Francisco''{{'}}s gunfire caused extensive damage to ''Atlanta'', killing Admiral Scott and most of ''Atlanta''{{'}}s bridge crew. Belatedly, ''San Francisco'' realized she was firing on a \"friendly\" ship and ceased fire. The green dye that ''San Francisco'' used to distinguish her shells from those of other ships, was later found stained on ''Atlanta''{{'}}s superstructure before she sank. Shortly thereafter, {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Hiei||2}} was sighted and taken under fire, at an initial range of only {{convert|2200|yd|m|abbr=on}}.\n\nAt about 0200, ''San Francisco'' trained her guns on {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Kirishima||2}}. At the same time, she became the target of {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Nagara||2}} off her starboard bow and of a destroyer which had crossed her bow and was passing down her port side. The enemy battleship joined the cruiser and the destroyer in firing on ''San Francisco'' whose port {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}} battery engaged the destroyer but was put out of action except for one mount. The battleship put the starboard {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}} battery out of commission. ''San Francisco'' swung left while her main battery continued to fire on the battleships which, with the cruiser and the destroyer, continued to pound ''San Francisco''. A direct hit on the navigation bridge killed or badly wounded all officers, except for the communications officer, [[Lieutenant Commander#United States|Lieutenant Commander]] [[Bruce McCandless]].<ref>{{cite video\n | year =1942\n | title =Video: America Reports On Aid To Allies Etc. (1942)\n | url =https://archive.org/details/gov.archives.arc.38937\n | publisher =[[Universal Newsreel]]\n | accessdate =21 February 2012\n}}</ref> Command fell to the damage control officer, Lieutenant Commander [[Herbert E. Schonland]], but he thought his own efforts were needed to keep the ship \"afloat and right-side up\", so he ordered McCandless to stay at the [[conn (nautical)|conn]]. Steering and engine control were lost and shifted to Battle Two. Battle Two was out of commission by a direct hit from the port side. Control was again lost.\n\nControl was reestablished in the [[conning tower]], which soon received a hit from the [[starboard]] side. Steering and engine control were temporarily lost, then regained. All communications were now dead.\n\nSoon thereafter, the enemy ceased firing. ''San Francisco'' followed suit and withdrew eastward along the north coast of Guadalcanal.\n\nSeventy-seven sailors, including Rear Admiral Daniel J. Callaghan and Captain [[Cassin Young]], had been killed. Captain Young, like the ''San Francisco'', was a veteran of the Pearl Harbor attack. 105 had been wounded. Of seven missing, three were subsequently rescued. The ship had taken 45 hits. Structural damage was extensive, but not fatal. No hits had been received below the waterline. Twenty-two fires had been started and extinguished.\n\nAt about 0400, ''San Francisco'', all her compasses out of commission, joined ''Helena'' and ''Juneau'' and followed them through [[Sealark Channel]] to sail to Espiritu Santo for initial repairs.\n\nAt about 1000, ''Juneau''{{'}}s medical personnel transferred to ''San Francisco'' to assist in treating the numerous wounded. An hour later, ''Juneau'' took a torpedo on her port side from {{Ship|Japanese submarine|I-26||2}}, striking in the vicinity of the bridge. \"The entire ship seemed to explode in one mighty column of brown and white smoke and flame which rose easily a thousand feet in the air. The ''Juneau'' literally disintegrated.\" ''San Francisco'' was hit by several large fragments from ''Juneau''. One man was hit, both his legs were broken. Nothing was seen in the water after the smoke lifted. The surviving ships were ordered to keep going without stopping to look for survivors. Unfortunately, the 100+ survivors (out of a total complement of 697) of ''Juneau'' were forced to wait eight days for rescue while floating in the ocean, undergoing intense [[shark]] attacks. Only ten survived.\n\nOn the afternoon of 14 November, ''San Francisco'' returned towards Espiritu Santo. For her participation in the action of the morning of the 13th, and for that of the night of 11\u201312 October, she received the [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]]. On 18 November, the cruiser sailed for Noum\u00e9a, and, on 23 November, she got underway toward the United States. She reached San Francisco on 11 December. Three days later, repairs were begun at [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard]].\n\n===1943\u20131944===\nDuring the yard period to repair battle damage, ''San Francisco'' received a general modernization similar to other US cruisers.  Her forward superstructure was remodeled, with the bridge wings cut back, and most of the bridge windows either plated over or replaced by portholes.  A large open bridge was built out at the 02 level, and modern SG surface search radar and air search radars added.  In addition many 20mm and 40mm anti-aircraft cannons were installed.  On 26 February 1943, she got underway to return to the South Pacific. After escorting convoy PW 2211 ''en route'', ''San Francisco'' arrived at Noum\u00e9a on 20 March. Five days later, she continued on to [[Efate]]. She arrived back in the [[Hawaiian Islands]] in mid-April. She then headed north to the [[Aleutian Islands]] to join the [[North Pacific Force]], TF 16, and reached Alaska toward the end of the month. Based at [[Kuluk Bay]], [[Adak Island]], she operated in the Aleutians for the next 4\u00bd months. She patrolled the western approaches to the area; participated in the [[Battle of the Aleutian Islands|assault and occupation of Attu]] in May and of [[Kiska]] in July; and performed escort duties.\n[[File:USS San Francisco (CA-38) in Kuluk Bay, Adak Island, April 1943.jpg|thumb|left|''San Francisco'' off Adak Island in April 1943]]\n\nIn mid-September, she was ordered back to Pearl Harbor for repairs and reassignment to TF 14. On 29 September, ''San Francisco'' departed Pearl Harbor in Task Unit 14.2.1 (TU 14.2.1) for a raid against Wake Island. On 5 October, the group arrived off the target area and conducted two runs by the enemy positions. On 11 October, her task unit returned to Pearl Harbor.\n\nOn 20 November, the force arrived off [[Butaritari|Makin]]. ''San Francisco'' participated in the pre-invasion bombardment of [[Betio]], then patrolled outside the transport area to the west of Makin. On the 26th, she was detached and assigned to TG 50.1, joining {{USS|Yorktown|CV-10|2}}, {{USS|Lexington|CV-16|2}}, {{USS|Cowpens|CVL-25|2}}, five cruisers, and six destroyers. With that force, she steamed toward the Marshall Islands to strike Japanese shipping and installations in the [[Kwajalein]] area. On 4 December, the carriers launched their planes against the targets. Shortly after noon, enemy aerial activity increased, and at 1250, ''San Francisco'' came under attack. Three torpedo bombers closed her on the port bow. Her guns \"splashed\" two. The third was shot down by ''Yorktown''. But during the attack, the cruiser had been strafed several times. One man had been killed, and 22 were wounded. After dark, the Japanese returned, and on that night, ''Lexington'' was torpedoed. The force moved north and west. Shortly after 0130 on 5 December, enemy planes faded from the radar screens. The next day, the ships headed back to Pearl Harbor.\n\nOn 22 January 1944, ''San Francisco'' sortied with TF 52 and again headed for the Marshalls. On 29 January, the division, screened by destroyers, left the formation and moved against Japanese installations on [[Maloelap]] to neutralize them during the [[Battle of Kwajalein|conquest of Kwajalein]]. Following the bombardment, the ships proceeded on to Kwajalein. ''San Francisco'' arrived off the atoll at about 0630 on 31 January. At 0730, she opened fire on targets of opportunity, initially a small ship inside Kwajalein lagoon. At 0849, she ceased firing. At 0900, she resumed firing at targets on Berlin and Beverly islands. Through the day, she continued to shell those islands, and, in late afternoon, added Bennett Island to her targets. During the next week, she provided pre-landing barrages and support fire for operations against Burton, Berlin, and Beverly islands. On 8 February, the cruiser sailed for [[Majuro]], whence she would operate as a unit of TF 58, the [[fast carrier task force]].\n\nOn 12 February, ''San Francisco'', in TG 58.2, cleared Majuro lagoon. Four days later, the carriers launched their planes as part of [[Operation Hailstone]]. On the night of 16\u201317 February, {{USS|Intrepid|CV-11|2}} was torpedoed. ''San Francisco'', with others, was assigned to escort her eastward. On 19 February, the group split; ''Intrepid'', with two destroyers, continued toward Pearl Harbor, while ''San Francisco'' and the remaining ships headed for Majuro. On 25 February, ''San Francisco'' sailed for Hawaii with TG 58.2. On 20 March, the group returned to Majuro, refueled, and departed again on 22 March to move against the Western [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]]. From 30 March to 1 April, carrier planes hit the [[Palaus]] and [[Woleai]]. ''San Francisco''{{'}}s planes flew rescue missions.\n\nOn 6 April, the force was back in Majuro lagoon. A week later, the ships set a course for New Guinea. From 21\u201328 April, TG 58.2 supported the assault landings in the [[Jayapura|Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura)]] area. On 29 April, the ships moved back into the Carolines for another raid against [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]]. On 30 April, ''San Francisco'' was detached and, with eight other cruisers, moved against [[Satawan]]. On completion of that bombardment mission, the cruisers rejoined TG 58.2 and headed back to the Marshalls.\n\nInitially at Majuro, ''San Francisco'' shifted to Kwajalein in early June, and on 10 June, departed that atoll in TG 53.15, the bombardment group of the [[Saipan]] invasion force. On 14 June, she commenced two days of shelling [[Tinian]], and after the [[Battle of Saipan|landings on Saipan]] shifted to fire support duties. On 16 June, she temporarily joined CruDiv 9 to bombard [[Guam]]. Word of a Japanese force en route to Saipan, however, interrupted the cannonade, and the ships returned to Saipan.\n\nOn 17 June, ''San Francisco'' refueled and took up station between the approaching enemy force and the amphibious force at Saipan. On the morning of 19 June, the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]] opened for ''San Francisco''. At about 1046, she was straddled fore and aft by bombs. \"... a mass of enemy planes on the screen at {{convert|20|mi|km|-1}}.\" At 1126, the cruiser opened fire. A 40&nbsp;mm shell from ''Indianapolis'' set off ''San Francisco''{{'}}s smoke screen generators. By noon, quiet had returned. At 1424, dive bombers made the last Japanese attack. By 20 June, ''San Francisco'' steamed westward in pursuit of the Japanese force. The next day, she returned to the Saipan area and resumed operations with the covering force for the transports. On 8 July, ''San Francisco'' again steamed to Guam to bombard enemy positions. During the next four days, she shelled targets in the [[Agat, Guam|Agat]] and [[Agana]] areas. On 12 July, she returned to Saipan to replenish and refuel, and on 18 July, again took station off Guam.\n\nFrom 18\u201320 July, she shelled enemy positions, supported [[underwater demolition team|beach demolition units]], and provided night harassing and defense repair interdiction in the Agat and Faci Point areas. On 21 July, she began to support Marines assaulting the Agat beaches. On 24 July, the cruiser shifted her fire to [[Orote Point]].\n\nOn 30 July, she headed, via Eniwetok and Pearl Harbor, for San Francisco. The cruiser arrived back on the west coast on 16 August for overhaul.\n\nOn 31 October, she steamed west again, and on 21 November arrived at [[Ulithi]], where she resumed flagship duties for CruDiv 6. On 10 December, she cleared the anchorage and moved toward the [[Philippines]] in TG 38.1. On 14\u201315 December, during carrier strikes against [[Luzon]], ''San Francisco''{{'}}s planes were employed on antisubmarine patrol and in rescue work. On 16 December, the force headed for a rendezvous with TG 30.17, the replenishment force. A [[typhoon]] interrupted the refueling operations; and the ships rode out the storm for the next two days. On 19 December, she participated in a search for survivors from three destroyers which had gone down during the typhoon.\n\nOn 20 December, TF 38 turned westward again to resume operations against Luzon; but high seas precluded strikes. On 24 December, the force returned to Ulithi.\n\n===1945===\nSix days later, the force again sortied from Ulithi. On 2\u20133 January 1945, strikes were conducted against [[Taiwan|Formosa]]. From 5\u20137 January, Luzon was hit. On 9 January, fighter sweeps against Formosa were resumed. The force then headed for the [[Bashi Channel]] and a [[South China Sea raid|five-day, high-speed strike]] against enemy surface units in the [[South China Sea]] and against installations along the coast of [[Indochina]]. On 15\u201316 January, the [[Hong Kong]]-[[Amoy]]-[[Shantou|Swatow]] area was hit, and on 20 January, the force passed through [[Luzon Strait]] to resume operations against Formosa. On 21 January, aerial opposition was constant. Bogies appeared on the screen throughout the day. {{USS|Langley|CVL-27|2}} and {{USS|Ticonderoga|CV-14|2}} were hit. On 22 January, strikes were launched against the [[Ryukyu Islands]], and the next day, the force headed for the Western Carolines.\n\nArriving on 26 January, the ships sailed again on 10 February. On 16\u201317 February, strikes were conducted against air facilities in central [[Honsh\u016b]]. On 18 February, the force moved toward the [[Volcano Islands|Volcano]] and [[Bonin Islands]], and on 19 February, covering operations for the [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima assault]] began. The next day, ''San Francisco'' closed on [[Iwo Jima]] with other cruisers and assumed fire support duties, which she continued until 23 February. Then she headed back toward [[Japan]]. On 25 February, [[Tokyo]] was the target. Poor weather prohibited operations against [[Nagoya, Aichi|Nagoya]] on the following day, and on 27 February, the force headed back to Ulithi.\n\nOn 21 March, ''San Francisco'', now attached to [[Okinawa naval order of battle#Gunfire and Covering Force (Task Force 54)|Task Force 54]] (TF 54) for [[Battle of Okinawa|the invasion of Okinawa]], departed Ulithi for the Ryukyus. On 25 March, she approached [[Kerama Retto]], west of [[Okinawa]], and furnished fire support for [[Naval mine|mine]]sweeping and underwater demolition operations. That night, she retired and the next morning moved back in to support the landings and supply counter battery fire on [[Aka Island|Aka]], [[Geruma Island|Keruma]], [[Zamami Island|Zamami]], and [[Yakabi Shima|Yakabi Island]]s.\n\nBy the morning of 27 March, aerial resistance had begun. The next day, ''San Francisco'' shifted to Okinawa for shore bombardment in preparation for the assault landings scheduled for 1 April. On that day, she took up station in fire support sector 5, west of [[Naha, Okinawa|Naha]], and, for the next five days, shelled enemy emplacements, caves, [[Bunker#Pillbox|pillbox]]es, road junctions, and tanks, truck, and troop concentrations. At night, she provided harassing fire near the beachhead.\n\nOn 6 April, the cruiser retired to Kerama Retto, refueled and took on ammunition, assisted in splashing a [[Nakajima B6N]] \"Jill\" torpedo bomber, then rejoined TF 54 off Okinawa as that force underwent another air raid. ''San Francisco'' downed a [[Nakajima B5N]] \"Kate\" torpedo bomber. Dawn of 7 April brought another air raid, during which a ''[[kamikaze]]'' attempted to crash the cruiser. It was splashed {{convert|50|yd|m|abbr=on}} off the starboard bow. After the raid, ''San Francisco'' shifted to TF 51 for fire support missions on the east coast of Okinawa, rejoining TF 54 on the west coast in late afternoon. On 11 April, air attacks increased, and the next day, ''San Francisco'' set an [[Aichi D3A]] \"Val\" [[dive bomber]] on fire. The plane then glanced off a merchant ship and hit the water, enveloped in flames.\n\nOn 13\u201314 April, the cruiser again operated with TF 51 off the east coast of the embattled island. The next day, she returned to Kerama Retto, there proceeding to Okinawa and operations with TF 54 in the transport area. There she provided night illumination to detect swimmers and [[Shinyo (suicide boat)|''Shinyo'' suicide boat]]s, and just before midnight assisted in sinking one of the latter. During the night, two further attempts by ''Shinyo''s to close the transports were thwarted.\n\n[[File:USS San Francisco (CA-38) off the Korean coast, 28 September 1945.jpg|thumb|right|''San Francisco'' near Korea in 1945.]]\n\nWith dawn, ''San Francisco'' returned to the Naha area to shell the airfield there. On 17 April, she moved up the coast and fired on the [[Machinate air field]]. The next day, she again shifted to the eastern side of the island and, that night, anchored in [[Nakagusuku Wan]]. The next day, ''San Francisco'' supported troops in the southern part of the island. From 21\u201324 April, she shelled targets in the Naha airstrip area; and got underway for Ulithi.\n\nOn 13 May, ''San Francisco'' returned to Okinawa, arriving in Nakagusuku Wan and resuming support activities against targets in southern Okinawa. For the next few days, ''San Francisco'' supported the [[96th Infantry Division (United States)|96th Infantry Division]] in an area to the southeast of [[Yonabaru, Okinawa|Yonabaru]]. On 20 May, she shifted to [[Kutaka Shima]], and by the night of 22 May, she had depleted her supply of ammunition for her main batteries. On 25 May, the Japanese launched a large air attack against Allied shipping in Nakagusuku Wan. On 27 May, ''San Francisco'' provided fire support for the [[77th Infantry Division (United States)|77th Infantry Division]], and retired to Kerama Retto the next day. On 30 May, the cruiser returned to the western side of Okinawa and, for the next two weeks, supported operations of the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st]] and [[6th Marine Division (United States)|6th Marine Divisions]].\n\nOn 21 June, ''San Francisco'' was ordered to join TG 32.15, {{convert|120|mi|km|abbr=on}} southeast of Okinawa. A week later, she put into Kerama Retto for a brief stay, then rejoined that group. In early July, she provided cover for the eastern anchorage. On 3 July, she sailed toward the Philippines to prepare for an [[Operation Downfall|invasion of the Japanese home islands]]. The cessation of hostilities in mid-August, however, obviated that operation, and ''San Francisco'' prepared for occupation duty.\n\nBetween 7 December 1941 and 7 October 1945, ''San Francisco'' travelled 480,000 km and burned 114,478,423 litres of fuel oil. On her voyages, she crossed the equator 24 times and the international date line 33 times. Her guns fired 11,022 203mm shells, 24,191 127mm shells, 70,243 40mm shells and 73,904 20mm shells and her crew suffered 267 combat casualties. Her planes flew for 3,714 hours. The crew consumed 3,983,712 kg of edible provisions, ate 332,937 kg of beef, ate 925,328 kg of potatoes, ate 5,760,000 slices of bread and smoked 1,838,780 packs of cigarettes.<ref>U.S. Navy statistics [https://www.navysite.de/cruisebooks/ca38-45/078.htm] from the [https://www.navysite.de/cruisebooks/ca38-45/index_003.htm USS ''San Francisco'' (CA-38) World War II cruise book] available at [http://navysite.de/cruisebooks/index.html Navysite.de]</ref>\n\n==Post-war==\nOn 28 August 1945, the cruiser departed [[U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay|Subic Bay]] for the [[China]] coast. After a show of force in the [[Yellow Sea]] and [[Bohai Sea|Gulf of Pohai]] areas, she covered minesweeping operations, and on 8 October anchored at [[Inchon, Korea]]. From 13\u201316 October, she participated in another show of force operation in the Gulf of Pohai area, then returned to Inchon, where Rear Admiral [[Jerauld Wright]], Commander, CruDiv 6, acted as senior member of the committee for the surrender of Japanese naval forces in [[Korea]].\n\nOn 27 November, ''San Francisco'' headed home. Arriving at San Francisco in mid-December, she continued on to the east coast on 5 January 1946, and arrived at [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] for inactivation on 19 January. Decommissioned on 10 February, she was berthed with the Philadelphia Group of the [[Atlantic Reserve Fleet]] until 1 March 1959, when her name was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]]. On 9 September, she was sold to the Union Mineral and Alloys Corp., New York, and scrapped at [[Panama City, Florida]] in 1961.\n\n==War memorials==\n{{Main|USS San Francisco Memorial}}\n[[File:3852 Bridge (33734921503).jpg|thumb|right|Removed bridge wings at Lands End]]\nDuring the December 1942 repair at Mare Island, it was necessary to extensively rebuild the bridge.

Commissioned in 1934, she was one of the most decorated ships of [[World War II]], [[Most decorated US ships of World War II|earning 17 battle stars]].\n\nLike most of her [[sister ship]]s, she saw extensive action during the [[Guadalcanal campaign]], including the [[Battle of Cape Esperance]] and the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]], during which she was heavily damaged and her captain and admiral killed. Earlier in the battle she mistakenly fired on the light cruiser {{USS|Atlanta|CL-51|2}}, causing serious damage and inflicting numerous casualties.\n\nDecommissioned immediately after the end of the war, she was sold for scrap in 1959.\n\nHer [[bridge wing]]s, damaged during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal and removed during repairs, are now mounted on a promontory in [[Golden Gate National Recreation Area]]. They are set on the [[great circle]] course from [[San Francisco]] to [[Guadalcanal]].\n\n==Construction and commissioning==\n''San Francisco'' was [[laid down]] on 9 September 1931 at the [[Mare Island Navy Yard]], [[Vallejo, California]] under the supervision of Naval constructor [[Charles W. Fisher Jr.]]; [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 9 March 1933; sponsored by Miss Barbara M. Bailly; and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 10 February 1934, [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Royal E. Ingersoll]] in command.\n\nThe ''New Orleans''-class cruisers were the last U.S. cruisers built to the specifications and standards of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922.  Such ships, with a limit of 10,000 tons standard displacement and 8-inch caliber main guns may be referred to as \"treaty cruisers.\" Originally classified as a [[light cruiser]] before she was laid down due to her thin armor, she was reclassified as a [[heavy cruiser]] because of her 8-inch guns. The term \"heavy cruiser\" was not defined until the [[London Naval Treaty]] in 1930.\n\n==Inter-war period==\nAfter an extensive shakedown cruise \u2013 which included operations off [[Mexico]], in Hawaiian waters, off [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[British Columbia]], and a voyage to the [[Panama Canal Zone]] \u2014 the cruiser returned to the Mare Island Navy Yard. Gunnery installation and conversion to a flagship took her into 1935. In February, she joined Cruiser Division 6 (Crudiv 6) at [[San Diego]]. In May, she moved north and participated in [[Fleet Problem XVI]], then returned to southern [[California]]. A few weeks later, she was back off the northwest coast for fleet tactics, and in July, she steamed farther north to [[Alaska]]. In August, she returned to California and, through the end of 1938, San Francisco continued to range the eastern Pacific, cruising from the state of Washington to [[Peru]] and from California to [[Hawaii]].\n\nIn January 1939, she departed the west coast to participate in [[Fleet Problem XX]], conducted in the Atlantic east of the [[Lesser Antilles]]. In March, she became flagship of CruDiv 7 and commenced a goodwill tour of South American ports. Departing [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]] in early April, she called at ports on the east coast of that continent, moved through the [[Strait of Magellan]] and visited west coast ports, then in early June, transited the [[Panama Canal]] to complete her voyage around the continent.\n\n==World War II==\nOn 1 September 1939, [[World War II]] started, and on 14 September, ''San Francisco'' moved south from [[Naval Station Norfolk]] to join the [[Neutrality Patrol]]. The cruiser carried freight and passengers to [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], thence sailed for a patrol of the [[West Indies]] as far south as [[Trinidad]]. On 14 October, she completed her patrol back at San Juan and headed for Norfolk, where she remained into January 1940. On 11 January, she headed for Guantanamo Bay, where she was relieved as flagship by {{USS|Wichita|CA-45|2}}, where she returned to the Pacific.\n\nTransiting the Panama Canal in late February, she called at San Pedro and, in March, continued on to her new home port, [[Pearl Harbor]], where she rejoined CruDiv 6. In May 1940, she steamed northwest to the [[Puget Sound Navy Yard]] for an overhaul, during which she also received four {{convert|3|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns. On 29 September, she returned to Pearl Harbor. In early May 1941, she became flagship of CruDiv 6; and, at the end of July, she moved east for a cruise to [[Long Beach, California]], returning to Hawaii on 27 August. In September, the flag of CruDiv 6 was hauled down; and on 11 October, ''San Francisco'' entered the [[Pearl Harbor Navy Yard]] for an overhaul which was scheduled for completion on 25 December.\n\n===Pearl Harbor attack===\nOn 7 December 1941, ''San Francisco'' was in Pearl Harbor and was awaiting docking and the cleaning of her heavily fouled bottom. Her engineering plant was largely broken down for overhaul. Ammunition for her {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}} and {{convert|8|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns had been placed in storage. Her {{convert|3|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns had been removed to permit installation of four {{convert|1.1|in|mm|abbr=on}} quadruple mounts, although the mounts had not yet been installed. Her {{convert|.50|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} [[machine gun]]s were being overhauled. Only small arms and two {{convert|.30|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} machine guns were available. Moreover, a number of ''San Francisco''{{'}}s officers and men were absent.\n\nAt 0755, Japanese planes began bombing dives on [[Ford Island]], and by 0800, the surprise [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] was well underway. The men in ''San Francisco'' secured the ship for watertightness and began looking for opportunities to fight back. Some crossed to {{USS|New Orleans|CA-32|2}} to help man anti-aircraft batteries on that ship. Others began using available rifles and machine guns. Ammunition for {{convert|.50|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} machine guns was transferred to {{USS|Tracy|DD-214|2}} for use.\n\n''San Francisco'' was not bombed or damaged during the Japanese air raid. After the attack was over, work resumed to make ''San Francisco'' seaworthy and combat-ready.\n\nOn 14 December, the cruiser left the yard; the scaling of her keel had been postponed in favor of more necessary repairs on other ships. On 16 December, she sortied with Task Force 14 (TF 14) to relieve [[Wake Island]]. The force moved west with a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] squadron onboard {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|2}} and a Marine [[battalion]] embarked in {{USS|Tangier|AV-8|2}}. However, when Wake Island fell to the Japanese on 23 December, TF 14 was diverted to [[Midway Atoll]] which it reinforced. On 29 December, the force returned to Pearl Harbor.\n\n===1942===\nOn 8 January 1942, ''San Francisco'' again moved west. In TF 8, she steamed toward [[Samoa]] to rendezvous with, and cover the off-loading of, transports carrying reinforcements to [[Tutuila]], Samoa. There, she joined [[Task Force 17]] for raids on Japanese installations in the [[Gilbert Islands|Gilbert]] and [[Marshall Islands]]. ''San Francisco'' arrived in the Samoan area on 18 January, and on the 24th was detached to continue coverage for the transports while the remainder of the task force and TF 17 conducted offensive operations to the northwest.\n\nOn 8 February, ''San Francisco'' departed from Tutuila. On the 10th, she rejoined CruDiv 6, then in TF 11, and she set a course for an area northeast of the [[Solomon Islands]] to strike [[Rabaul]]. However, the American force was sighted and attacked by two waves of [[Mitsubishi G4M]] \"Betty\" [[medium bomber]]s. Sixteen of the planes were destroyed, but since the element of surprise had been lost, TF 11 retired eastward.\n\nDuring the next few days, TF 11 \u2013 centered around {{USS|Lexington|CV-2|2}} \u2014 conducted operations in the [[South Pacific Area]], then headed for [[New Guinea]] to participate with TF 17 in a raid against Japanese shipping and installations.\n\nOn 7 March, one of ''San Francisco''{{'}}s scout planes was reported missing and could not be found.\n\nOn the night of 9\u201310 March, TFs 11 and 17 entered the [[Gulf of Papua]], whence, at dawn, ''Lexington'' and {{USS|Yorktown|CV-5|2}} launched their aircraft to cross the [[Owen Stanley Range]] and attack the Japanese at [[Salamaua]] and [[Lae]].\n\nThe next day, the missing plane was sighted by {{USS|Minneapolis|CA-36|2}} and recovered by ''San Francisco''. It had landed on the water, but had been unable to communicate. The pilot, [[Lieutenant]] J. A. Thomas, and the radioman, O. J. Gannan, had headed for [[Australia]], sailing the plane backwards as it tended to head into the prevailing east wind. In five days and 21 hours, they had covered approximately 385 miles (715&nbsp;km) on a course within 5 degrees of that intended.\n\n''San Francisco'' returned to Pearl Harbor on 26 March. On 22 April, the cruiser departed [[Oahu]] for San Francisco in the escort of convoy 4093. At the end of May, she headed west, escorting convoy PW 2076, made up of transports carrying the [[37th Infantry Division (United States)|37th Army Division]], destined for [[Suva]], and special troops bound for Australia. The cruiser remained in the escort force as far as [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]]. There she steamed for Hawaii, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 29 June.\n\n''San Francisco'' steamed west with {{USS|Laffey|DD-459|2}} and {{USS|Ballard|DD-267|2}} to escort convoy 4120 to the [[Fiji|Fiji Islands]]. From there, she got underway to rendezvous with the Solomon Islands Expeditionary Force.\n\n[[Operation Watchtower]] \u2014 the [[Guadalcanal]]-[[Tulagi]] offensive \u2013 opened on the morning of 7 August. Through that day and the remainder of the month, ''San Francisco'' helped to cover the American forces in the area. The flag of [[Rear admiral#United States|Rear Admiral]] [[Norman Scott (admiral)|Norman Scott]], commanding the cruisers attached to TF 18, was shifted to ''San Francisco''.\n\nOn 3 September, ''San Francisco''{{'}}s force put into [[Noum\u00e9a]], [[New Caledonia]], for fuel and provisions. On 8 September, the ships departed that island to cover reinforcements moving up to Guadalcanal. On the 11th, ''San Francisco''{{'}}s force, TF 18, rendezvoused with TF 17, the {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|2}} group, and the next day, both groups refueled at sea. On 14 September, the reinforcement convoy departed the [[New Hebrides]]. TF 61 commenced covering operations with TF 17, operating east of TF 18 and conforming to their movements.\n\nAt about 1450 on 15 September, {{USS|Wasp|CV-7|2}} was torpedoed on the starboard side. Fires broke out on the carrier. Explosions multiplied the fires. Admiral Scott took command of TF 18. ''San Francisco'' and {{USS|Salt Lake City|CA-25|2}} prepared to take the carrier in tow, but by 1520, the fires were out of control and destroyers began taking on survivors. {{USS|Lansdowne|DD-486|2}} torpedoed the burning hulk. TF 18 then headed for [[Espiritu Santo]].\n\nOn the morning of 17 September, ''San Francisco'', {{USS|Juneau|CL-52|2}}, and five destroyers put back to sea to rendezvous with TF 17 and resume coverage of reinforcement convoys. Other units of TF 18 had headed for Noum\u00e9a with ''Wasp'' survivors.\n\nOn 23 September, ''San Francisco'', ''Salt Lake City'', ''Minneapolis'', {{USS|Chester|CA-27|2}}, {{USS|Boise|CL-47|2}}, and {{USS|Helena|CL-50|2}}, and Destroyer Squadron 12 (DesRon 12) became TF 64, a surface screening and attack force under the command of Admiral Scott in ''San Francisco''. The next day, the force headed to the New Hebrides.\n\n====Battle of Cape Esperance====\n{{main|Battle of Cape Esperance}}\nOn 7 October 1942, TF 64 (minus ''Chester'' and ''Minneapolis'') departed from Espiritu Santo, the New Hebrides, and moved back into the Solomons to cover Allied reinforcements and to intercept similar operations by the Japanese. On 11 October, at about 1615, the ships commenced a run northward from Rennel Island, to intercept an enemy force of two cruisers and six destroyers reported heading for Guadalcanal from the Buin-Faisi, [[Bougainville Island]] area. The force continued north to approach [[Savo Island]] in [[The Slot]] from the southwest.\n\nBy 2330, when the warships were approximately {{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=on}} northwest of Savo Island, they turned to make a further search of the area. A few minutes after setting the new course, radar indicated unidentified ships to the west, several thousand yards distant. At about 2345, the Battle of Cape Esperance began.\n\nInitial confusion caused both sides to momentarily check their fire in fear of hitting their own ships. Then, the battle was reopened and continued until 0020 on 12 October, when surviving Japanese ships retired toward the [[Shortland Islands]]. ''Salt Lake City'', ''Boise'', {{USS|Duncan|DD-485|2}} and {{USS|Farenholt|DD-491|2}}, had been damaged. Later, ''Duncan'' went down. {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Furutaka||2}} and a destroyer had been sunk during the surface action. Two more enemy destroyers were sunk on 12 October by Marine planes from [[Henderson Field (Guadalcanal)|Henderson Field]]. After the engagement, TF 64 retired to Espiritu Santo.\n\nOn 15 October, ''San Francisco'' resumed operations in support of the Guadalcanal campaign. On the evening of 20 October, her group was ordered back to Espiritu Santo. At 2119, submarine's torpedoes were reported. ''Chester'' was hit amidships on the starboard side but continued under her own power. Three other torpedoes exploded: one off ''Helena''{{'}}s starboard quarter; a second between ''Helena'' and ''San Francisco''; and the third about {{convert|1200|yd|m|abbr=on}} off ''San Francisco''{{'}}s port beam. Two others were sighted running on the surface.\n\n''San Francisco'' reached Espiritu Santo on the night of 21 October, but departed again on 22 October to intercept any enemy surface units approaching Guadalcanal from the north and to cover friendly reinforcements. On 28 October, Admiral Scott transferred to ''Atlanta''. The next day, ''San Francisco'' returned to Espiritu Santo, and on 30 October, Rear Admiral [[Daniel J. Callaghan]], the commanding officer of ''San Francisco'' when the United States entered the war, returned to the ship and raised his flag as Commander, Task Group 64.4 (TG 64.4) and prospective TF 65.\n\n====Naval Battle of Guadalcanal====\n{{main|Naval Battle of Guadalcanal}}\nOn 31 October 1942, the newly designated TF 65 departed from Espiritu Santo, the ships again headed into the Solomon Islands to cover troop landings on Guadalcanal. Bombardment missions in the [[Kokumbona]] and [[Koli Point]] areas followed. On 6 November, the transport group completed unloading, and the force retired, arriving at Espiritu Santo on 8 November. On 10 November, ''San Francisco'', now flagship for TG 67.4, got underway again toward Guadalcanal.\n\nJust before noon, a Japanese twin-float reconnaissance plane began shadowing the formation.\n\nThe force arrived off [[Lunga Point]] on 12 November, and the transports commenced unloading. By mid-afternoon, an approaching Japanese air group was reported. At 1318, the ships got underway. At 1408, 21 enemy planes attacked.\n\n[[File:Japanes air attack on shipping off Guadalcanal, 12 November 1942.jpg|thumb|''San Francisco'' (center) after being hit by a Japanese plane in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, 12 November 1942. Ship at left is {{USS|President Jackson|AP-37|2}}.]]\n\nAt 1416, an already-damaged [[torpedo bomber]] dropped its torpedo off ''San Francisco''{{'}}s starboard quarter. The torpedo passed alongside, but the plane crashed into ''San Francisco''{{'}}s control aft, swung around that structure, and plunged over the port side into the sea. 15 men were killed, 29 wounded, and one missing. Control aft was demolished. The ship's secondary command post, Battle Two, was burned out but was reestablished by dark. The after anti-aircraft director and radar were put out of commission. Three 20&nbsp;mm mounts were destroyed.\n\nThe wounded were transferred to {{USS|President Jackson|AP-37|2}}, just before the approach of an enemy surface force was reported. The covering force escorted the transports out of the area, then reassembled and returned. At about midnight, ''San Francisco'', in company with heavy cruiser USS ''Portland'', the light cruisers ''Atlanta'', ''Helena'', and ''Juneau'', and eight destroyers, entered [[Lengo Channel]].\n\nAt 0125 on 13 November, a Japanese naval force was discovered about {{convert|27000|yd|m|abbr=on}} to the northwest. Rear Admiral Callaghan's task group maneuvered to intercept in what became the first engagement in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. At 0148, in almost pitch darkness, ''San Francisco'' opened fire on an enemy cruiser {{convert|3700|yd|m|abbr=on}} off her starboard beam. At 0151, she trained her guns on a small cruiser or large destroyer {{convert|3300|yd|m|abbr=on}} off her starboard bow. Then in an attempt to locate other targets, ''San Francisco'' accidentally targeted {{USS|Atlanta|CL-51|2}}. ''San Francisco''{{'}}s gunfire caused extensive damage to ''Atlanta'', killing Admiral Scott and most of ''Atlanta''{{'}}s bridge crew. Belatedly, ''San Francisco'' realized she was firing on a \"friendly\" ship and ceased fire. The green dye that ''San Francisco'' used to distinguish her shells from those of other ships, was later found stained on ''Atlanta''{{'}}s superstructure before she sank. Shortly thereafter, {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Hiei||2}} was sighted and taken under fire, at an initial range of only {{convert|2200|yd|m|abbr=on}}.\n\nAt about 0200, ''San Francisco'' trained her guns on {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Kirishima||2}}. At the same time, she became the target of {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Nagara||2}} off her starboard bow and of a destroyer which had crossed her bow and was passing down her port side. The enemy battleship joined the cruiser and the destroyer in firing on ''San Francisco'' whose port {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}} battery engaged the destroyer but was put out of action except for one mount. The battleship put the starboard {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}} battery out of commission. ''San Francisco'' swung left while her main battery continued to fire on the battleships which, with the cruiser and the destroyer, continued to pound ''San Francisco''. A direct hit on the navigation bridge killed or badly wounded all officers, except for the communications officer, [[Lieutenant Commander#United States|Lieutenant Commander]] [[Bruce McCandless]].<ref>{{cite video\n | year =1942\n | title =Video: America Reports On Aid To Allies Etc. (1942)\n | url =https://archive.org/details/gov.archives.arc.38937\n | publisher =[[Universal Newsreel]]\n | accessdate =21 February 2012\n}}</ref> Command fell to the damage control officer, Lieutenant Commander [[Herbert E. Schonland]], but he thought his own efforts were needed to keep the ship \"afloat and right-side up\", so he ordered McCandless to stay at the [[conn (nautical)|conn]]. Steering and engine control were lost and shifted to Battle Two. Battle Two was out of commission by a direct hit from the port side. Control was again lost.\n\nControl was reestablished in the [[conning tower]], which soon received a hit from the [[starboard]] side. Steering and engine control were temporarily lost, then regained. All communications were now dead.\n\nSoon thereafter, the enemy ceased firing. ''San Francisco'' followed suit and withdrew eastward along the north coast of Guadalcanal.\n\nSeventy-seven sailors, including Rear Admiral Daniel J. Callaghan and Captain [[Cassin Young]], had been killed. Captain Young, like the ''San Francisco'', was a veteran of the Pearl Harbor attack. 105 had been wounded. Of seven missing, three were subsequently rescued. The ship had taken 45 hits. Structural damage was extensive, but not fatal. No hits had been received below the waterline. Twenty-two fires had been started and extinguished.\n\nAt about 0400, ''San Francisco'', all her compasses out of commission, joined ''Helena'' and ''Juneau'' and followed them through [[Sealark Channel]] to sail to Espiritu Santo for initial repairs.\n\nAt about 1000, ''Juneau''{{'}}s medical personnel transferred to ''San Francisco'' to assist in treating the numerous wounded. An hour later, ''Juneau'' took a torpedo on her port side from {{Ship|Japanese submarine|I-26||2}}, striking in the vicinity of the bridge. \"The entire ship seemed to explode in one mighty column of brown and white smoke and flame which rose easily a thousand feet in the air. The ''Juneau'' literally disintegrated.\" ''San Francisco'' was hit by several large fragments from ''Juneau''. One man was hit, both his legs were broken. Nothing was seen in the water after the smoke lifted. The surviving ships were ordered to keep going without stopping to look for survivors. Unfortunately, the 100+ survivors (out of a total complement of 697) of ''Juneau'' were forced to wait eight days for rescue while floating in the ocean, undergoing intense [[shark]] attacks. Only ten survived.\n\nOn the afternoon of 14 November, ''San Francisco'' returned towards Espiritu Santo. For her participation in the action of the morning of the 13th, and for that of the night of 11\u201312 October, she received the [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]]. On 18 November, the cruiser sailed for Noum\u00e9a, and, on 23 November, she got underway toward the United States. She reached San Francisco on 11 December. Three days later, repairs were begun at [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard]].\n\n===1943\u20131944===\nDuring the yard period to repair battle damage, ''San Francisco'' received a general modernization similar to other US cruisers.  Her forward superstructure was remodeled, with the bridge wings cut back, and most of the bridge windows either plated over or replaced by portholes.  A large open bridge was built out at the 02 level, and modern SG surface search radar and air search radars added.  In addition many 20mm and 40mm anti-aircraft cannons were installed.  On 26 February 1943, she got underway to return to the South Pacific. After escorting convoy PW 2211 ''en route'', ''San Francisco'' arrived at Noum\u00e9a on 20 March. Five days later, she continued on to [[Efate]]. She arrived back in the [[Hawaiian Islands]] in mid-April. She then headed north to the [[Aleutian Islands]] to join the [[North Pacific Force]], TF 16, and reached Alaska toward the end of the month. Based at [[Kuluk Bay]], [[Adak Island]], she operated in the Aleutians for the next 4\u00bd months. She patrolled the western approaches to the area; participated in the [[Battle of the Aleutian Islands|assault and occupation of Attu]] in May and of [[Kiska]] in July; and performed escort duties.\n[[File:USS San Francisco (CA-38) in Kuluk Bay, Adak Island, April 1943.jpg|thumb|left|''San Francisco'' off Adak Island in April 1943]]\n\nIn mid-September, she was ordered back to Pearl Harbor for repairs and reassignment to TF 14. On 29 September, ''San Francisco'' departed Pearl Harbor in Task Unit 14.2.1 (TU 14.2.1) for a raid against Wake Island. On 5 October, the group arrived off the target area and conducted two runs by the enemy positions. On 11 October, her task unit returned to Pearl Harbor.\n\nOn 20 November, the force arrived off [[Butaritari|Makin]]. ''San Francisco'' participated in the pre-invasion bombardment of [[Betio]], then patrolled outside the transport area to the west of Makin. On the 26th, she was detached and assigned to TG 50.1, joining {{USS|Yorktown|CV-10|2}}, {{USS|Lexington|CV-16|2}}, {{USS|Cowpens|CVL-25|2}}, five cruisers, and six destroyers. With that force, she steamed toward the Marshall Islands to strike Japanese shipping and installations in the [[Kwajalein]] area. On 4 December, the carriers launched their planes against the targets. Shortly after noon, enemy aerial activity increased, and at 1250, ''San Francisco'' came under attack. Three torpedo bombers closed her on the port bow. Her guns \"splashed\" two. The third was shot down by ''Yorktown''. But during the attack, the cruiser had been strafed several times. One man had been killed, and 22 were wounded. After dark, the Japanese returned, and on that night, ''Lexington'' was torpedoed. The force moved north and west. Shortly after 0130 on 5 December, enemy planes faded from the radar screens. The next day, the ships headed back to Pearl Harbor.\n\nOn 22 January 1944, ''San Francisco'' sortied with TF 52 and again headed for the Marshalls. On 29 January, the division, screened by destroyers, left the formation and moved against Japanese installations on [[Maloelap]] to neutralize them during the [[Battle of Kwajalein|conquest of Kwajalein]]. Following the bombardment, the ships proceeded on to Kwajalein. ''San Francisco'' arrived off the atoll at about 0630 on 31 January. At 0730, she opened fire on targets of opportunity, initially a small ship inside Kwajalein lagoon. At 0849, she ceased firing. At 0900, she resumed firing at targets on Berlin and Beverly islands. Through the day, she continued to shell those islands, and, in late afternoon, added Bennett Island to her targets. During the next week, she provided pre-landing barrages and support fire for operations against Burton, Berlin, and Beverly islands. On 8 February, the cruiser sailed for [[Majuro]], whence she would operate as a unit of TF 58, the [[fast carrier task force]].\n\nOn 12 February, ''San Francisco'', in TG 58.2, cleared Majuro lagoon. Four days later, the carriers launched their planes as part of [[Operation Hailstone]]. On the night of 16\u201317 February, {{USS|Intrepid|CV-11|2}} was torpedoed. ''San Francisco'', with others, was assigned to escort her eastward. On 19 February, the group split; ''Intrepid'', with two destroyers, continued toward Pearl Harbor, while ''San Francisco'' and the remaining ships headed for Majuro. On 25 February, ''San Francisco'' sailed for Hawaii with TG 58.2. On 20 March, the group returned to Majuro, refueled, and departed again on 22 March to move against the Western [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]]. From 30 March to 1 April, carrier planes hit the [[Palaus]] and [[Woleai]]. ''San Francisco''{{'}}s planes flew rescue missions.\n\nOn 6 April, the force was back in Majuro lagoon. A week later, the ships set a course for New Guinea. From 21\u201328 April, TG 58.2 supported the assault landings in the [[Jayapura|Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura)]] area. On 29 April, the ships moved back into the Carolines for another raid against [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]]. On 30 April, ''San Francisco'' was detached and, with eight other cruisers, moved against [[Satawan]]. On completion of that bombardment mission, the cruisers rejoined TG 58.2 and headed back to the Marshalls.\n\nInitially at Majuro, ''San Francisco'' shifted to Kwajalein in early June, and on 10 June, departed that atoll in TG 53.15, the bombardment group of the [[Saipan]] invasion force. On 14 June, she commenced two days of shelling [[Tinian]], and after the [[Battle of Saipan|landings on Saipan]] shifted to fire support duties. On 16 June, she temporarily joined CruDiv 9 to bombard [[Guam]]. Word of a Japanese force en route to Saipan, however, interrupted the cannonade, and the ships returned to Saipan.\n\nOn 17 June, ''San Francisco'' refueled and took up station between the approaching enemy force and the amphibious force at Saipan. On the morning of 19 June, the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]] opened for ''San Francisco''. At about 1046, she was straddled fore and aft by bombs. \"... a mass of enemy planes on the screen at {{convert|20|mi|km|-1}}.\" At 1126, the cruiser opened fire. A 40&nbsp;mm shell from ''Indianapolis'' set off ''San Francisco''{{'}}s smoke screen generators. By noon, quiet had returned. At 1424, dive bombers made the last Japanese attack. By 20 June, ''San Francisco'' steamed westward in pursuit of the Japanese force. The next day, she returned to the Saipan area and resumed operations with the covering force for the transports. On 8 July, ''San Francisco'' again steamed to Guam to bombard enemy positions. During the next four days, she shelled targets in the [[Agat, Guam|Agat]] and [[Agana]] areas. On 12 July, she returned to Saipan to replenish and refuel, and on 18 July, again took station off Guam.\n\nFrom 18\u201320 July, she shelled enemy positions, supported [[underwater demolition team|beach demolition units]], and provided night harassing and defense repair interdiction in the Agat and Faci Point areas. On 21 July, she began to support Marines assaulting the Agat beaches. On 24 July, the cruiser shifted her fire to [[Orote Point]].\n\nOn 30 July, she headed, via Eniwetok and Pearl Harbor, for San Francisco. The cruiser arrived back on the west coast on 16 August for overhaul.\n\nOn 31 October, she steamed west again, and on 21 November arrived at [[Ulithi]], where she resumed flagship duties for CruDiv 6. On 10 December, she cleared the anchorage and moved toward the [[Philippines]] in TG 38.1. On 14\u201315 December, during carrier strikes against [[Luzon]], ''San Francisco''{{'}}s planes were employed on antisubmarine patrol and in rescue work. On 16 December, the force headed for a rendezvous with TG 30.17, the replenishment force. A [[typhoon]] interrupted the refueling operations; and the ships rode out the storm for the next two days. On 19 December, she participated in a search for survivors from three destroyers which had gone down during the typhoon.\n\nOn 20 December, TF 38 turned westward again to resume operations against Luzon; but high seas precluded strikes. On 24 December, the force returned to Ulithi.\n\n===1945===\nSix days later, the force again sortied from Ulithi. On 2\u20133 January 1945, strikes were conducted against [[Taiwan|Formosa]]. From 5\u20137 January, Luzon was hit. On 9 January, fighter sweeps against Formosa were resumed. The force then headed for the [[Bashi Channel]] and a [[South China Sea raid|five-day, high-speed strike]] against enemy surface units in the [[South China Sea]] and against installations along the coast of [[Indochina]]. On 15\u201316 January, the [[Hong Kong]]-[[Amoy]]-[[Shantou|Swatow]] area was hit, and on 20 January, the force passed through [[Luzon Strait]] to resume operations against Formosa. On 21 January, aerial opposition was constant. Bogies appeared on the screen throughout the day. {{USS|Langley|CVL-27|2}} and {{USS|Ticonderoga|CV-14|2}} were hit. On 22 January, strikes were launched against the [[Ryukyu Islands]], and the next day, the force headed for the Western Carolines.\n\nArriving on 26 January, the ships sailed again on 10 February. On 16\u201317 February, strikes were conducted against air facilities in central [[Honsh\u016b]]. On 18 February, the force moved toward the [[Volcano Islands|Volcano]] and [[Bonin Islands]], and on 19 February, covering operations for the [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima assault]] began. The next day, ''San Francisco'' closed on [[Iwo Jima]] with other cruisers and assumed fire support duties, which she continued until 23 February. Then she headed back toward [[Japan]]. On 25 February, [[Tokyo]] was the target. Poor weather prohibited operations against [[Nagoya, Aichi|Nagoya]] on the following day, and on 27 February, the force headed back to Ulithi.\n\nOn 21 March, ''San Francisco'', now attached to [[Okinawa naval order of battle#Gunfire and Covering Force (Task Force 54)|Task Force 54]] (TF 54) for [[Battle of Okinawa|the invasion of Okinawa]], departed Ulithi for the Ryukyus. On 25 March, she approached [[Kerama Retto]], west of [[Okinawa]], and furnished fire support for [[Naval mine|mine]]sweeping and underwater demolition operations. That night, she retired and the next morning moved back in to support the landings and supply counter battery fire on [[Aka Island|Aka]], [[Geruma Island|Keruma]], [[Zamami Island|Zamami]], and [[Yakabi Shima|Yakabi Island]]s.\n\nBy the morning of 27 March, aerial resistance had begun. The next day, ''San Francisco'' shifted to Okinawa for shore bombardment in preparation for the assault landings scheduled for 1 April. On that day, she took up station in fire support sector 5, west of [[Naha, Okinawa|Naha]], and, for the next five days, shelled enemy emplacements, caves, [[Bunker#Pillbox|pillbox]]es, road junctions, and tanks, truck, and troop concentrations. At night, she provided harassing fire near the beachhead.\n\nOn 6 April, the cruiser retired to Kerama Retto, refueled and took on ammunition, assisted in splashing a [[Nakajima B6N]] \"Jill\" torpedo bomber, then rejoined TF 54 off Okinawa as that force underwent another air raid. ''San Francisco'' downed a [[Nakajima B5N]] \"Kate\" torpedo bomber. Dawn of 7 April brought another air raid, during which a ''[[kamikaze]]'' attempted to crash the cruiser. It was splashed {{convert|50|yd|m|abbr=on}} off the starboard bow. After the raid, ''San Francisco'' shifted to TF 51 for fire support missions on the east coast of Okinawa, rejoining TF 54 on the west coast in late afternoon. On 11 April, air attacks increased, and the next day, ''San Francisco'' set an [[Aichi D3A]] \"Val\" [[dive bomber]] on fire. The plane then glanced off a merchant ship and hit the water, enveloped in flames.\n\nOn 13\u201314 April, the cruiser again operated with TF 51 off the east coast of the embattled island. The next day, she returned to Kerama Retto, there proceeding to Okinawa and operations with TF 54 in the transport area. There she provided night illumination to detect swimmers and [[Shinyo (suicide boat)|''Shinyo'' suicide boat]]s, and just before midnight assisted in sinking one of the latter. During the night, two further attempts by ''Shinyo''s to close the transports were thwarted.\n\n[[File:USS San Francisco (CA-38) off the Korean coast, 28 September 1945.jpg|thumb|right|''San Francisco'' near Korea in 1945.]]\n\nWith dawn, ''San Francisco'' returned to the Naha area to shell the airfield there. On 17 April, she moved up the coast and fired on the [[Machinate air field]]. The next day, she again shifted to the eastern side of the island and, that night, anchored in [[Nakagusuku Wan]]. The next day, ''San Francisco'' supported troops in the southern part of the island. From 21\u201324 April, she shelled targets in the Naha airstrip area; and got underway for Ulithi.\n\nOn 13 May, ''San Francisco'' returned to Okinawa, arriving in Nakagusuku Wan and resuming support activities against targets in southern Okinawa. For the next few days, ''San Francisco'' supported the [[96th Infantry Division (United States)|96th Infantry Division]] in an area to the southeast of [[Yonabaru, Okinawa|Yonabaru]]. On 20 May, she shifted to [[Kutaka Shima]], and by the night of 22 May, she had depleted her supply of ammunition for her main batteries. On 25 May, the Japanese launched a large air attack against Allied shipping in Nakagusuku Wan. On 27 May, ''San Francisco'' provided fire support for the [[77th Infantry Division (United States)|77th Infantry Division]], and retired to Kerama Retto the next day. On 30 May, the cruiser returned to the western side of Okinawa and, for the next two weeks, supported operations of the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st]] and [[6th Marine Division (United States)|6th Marine Divisions]].\n\nOn 21 June, ''San Francisco'' was ordered to join TG 32.15, {{convert|120|mi|km|abbr=on}} southeast of Okinawa. A week later, she put into Kerama Retto for a brief stay, then rejoined that group. In early July, she provided cover for the eastern anchorage. On 3 July, she sailed toward the Philippines to prepare for an [[Operation Downfall|invasion of the Japanese home islands]]. The cessation of hostilities in mid-August, however, obviated that operation, and ''San Francisco'' prepared for occupation duty.\n\nBetween 7 December 1941 and 7 October 1945, ''San Francisco'' travelled 480,000 km and burned 114,478,423 litres of fuel oil. On her voyages, she crossed the equator 24 times and the international date line 33 times. Her guns fired 11,022 203mm shells, 24,191 127mm shells, 70,243 40mm shells and 73,904 20mm shells and her crew suffered 267 combat casualties. Her planes flew for 3,714 hours. The crew consumed 3,983,712 kg of edible provisions, ate 332,937 kg of beef, ate 925,328 kg of potatoes, ate 5,760,000 slices of bread and smoked 1,838,780 packs of cigarettes.<ref>U.S. Navy statistics [https://www.navysite.de/cruisebooks/ca38-45/078.htm] from the [https://www.navysite.de/cruisebooks/ca38-45/index_003.htm USS ''San Francisco'' (CA-38) World War II cruise book] available at [http://navysite.de/cruisebooks/index.html Navysite.de]</ref>\n\n==Post-war==\nOn 28 August 1945, the cruiser departed [[U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay|Subic Bay]] for the [[China]] coast. After a show of force in the [[Yellow Sea]] and [[Bohai Sea|Gulf of Pohai]] areas, she covered minesweeping operations, and on 8 October anchored at [[Inchon, Korea]]. From 13\u201316 October, she participated in another show of force operation in the Gulf of Pohai area, then returned to Inchon, where Rear Admiral [[Jerauld Wright]], Commander, CruDiv 6, acted as senior member of the committee for the surrender of Japanese naval forces in [[Korea]].\n\nOn 27 November, ''San Francisco'' headed home. Arriving at San Francisco in mid-December, she continued on to the east coast on 5 January 1946, and arrived at [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] for inactivation on 19 January. Decommissioned on 10 February, she was berthed with the Philadelphia Group of the [[Atlantic Reserve Fleet]] until 1 March 1959, when her name was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]]. On 9 September, she was sold to the Union Mineral and Alloys Corp., New York, and scrapped at [[Panama City, Florida]] in 1961.\n\n==War memorials==\n{{Main|USS San Francisco Memorial}}\n[[File:3852 Bridge (33734921503).jpg|thumb|right|Removed bridge wings at Lands End]]\nDuring the December 1942 repair at Mare Island, it was necessary to extensively rebuild the bridge. The bridge wings were removed as part of that repair, and are now part of a memorial to the ship on a promontory in [[Lands End, San Francisco]] at [[Golden Gate National Recreation Area]] overlooking the Pacific Ocean. One wing has extensive battle damage from the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. They are set on the [[great circle]] course from [[San Francisco]] to Guadalcanal.

It generalized analysis to the case of one good and all other goods, that is, the ''[[composite good]]''. It aggregated individuals and businesses through demand and supply across the economy. It anticipated the [[aggregation problem]], most acutely for the stock of capital goods. It introduced [[general equilibrium theory]] to an English-speaking audience, refined the theory, and for the first time attempted a rigorous statement of stability conditions for general equilibrium.\n\n==[[Macroeconomics]]==\nAmong the most important list of publication in macroeconomics are:\n\n===''[[General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]''===\n* [[John Maynard Keynes]], ''[[General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'', 1936\n\n'''Description''': In this book, Keynes put forward a theory based upon the notion of [[aggregate demand]] to explain variations in the overall level of economic activity, such as were observed in the [[Great Depression]]. The total income in a society is defined by the sum of consumption and investment; and in a state of unemployment and unused production capacity, one can only enhance employment and total income by first increasing expenditures for either consumption or investment.\n\n'''Importance:'''  Topic creator, Breakthrough, Influence\n\n===''[[A Monetary History of the United States]]''===\n* [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Anna Schwartz]], ''[[A Monetary History of the United States]]'', 1963\n\n'''Description''': Friedman and Schwartz used changes in monetary aggregates to explain business cycle fluctuations in the United States economy.\n\n'''Importance:''' Influence\n\n==[[Game theory]]==\n\n===[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]===\n* [[John von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern]]\n* Princeton University Press, 1944\n\n'''Description:''' The book by the [[mathematician]] [[John von Neumann]] and [[economist]] [[Oskar Morgenstern]]. It contained a mathematical theory of economic and social organization, based on a theory of games of strategy.\n\nThis is now a classic work, upon which modern-day [[game theory]] is based. Game theory has since been widely used to analyze real-world phenomena from [[arms race]]s to optimal policy choices of presidential candidates, from vaccination policy to major league baseball salary negotiations.

It generalized analysis to the case of one good and all other goods, that is, the ''[[composite good]]''. It aggregated individuals and businesses through demand and supply across the economy. It anticipated the [[aggregation problem]], most acutely for the stock of capital goods. It introduced [[general equilibrium theory]] to an English-speaking audience, refined the theory, and for the first time attempted a rigorous statement of stability conditions for general equilibrium.\n\n==[[Macroeconomics]]==\nAmong the most important list of publication in macroeconomics are:\n\n===''[[General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]''===\n* [[John Maynard Keynes]], ''[[General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'', 1936\n\n'''Description''': In this book, Keynes put forward a theory based upon the notion of [[aggregate demand]] to explain variations in the overall level of economic activity, such as were observed in the [[Great Depression]]. The total income in a society is defined by the sum of consumption and investment; and in a state of unemployment and unused production capacity, one can only enhance employment and total income by first increasing expenditures for either consumption or investment.\n\n'''Importance:'''  Topic creator, Breakthrough, Influence\n\n===''[[A Monetary History of the United States]]''===\n* [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Anna Schwartz]], ''[[A Monetary History of the United States]]'', 1963\n\n'''Description''': Friedman and Schwartz used changes in monetary aggregates to explain business cycle fluctuations in the United States economy.\n\n'''Importance:''' Influence\n\n==[[Game theory]]==\n\n===[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]===\n* [[John von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern]]\n* Princeton University Press, 1944\n\n'''Description:''' The book by the [[mathematician]] [[John von Neumann]] and [[economist]] [[Oskar Morgenstern]].

Game theory has since been widely used to analyze real-world phenomena from [[arms race]]s to optimal policy choices of presidential candidates, from vaccination policy to major league baseball salary negotiations.

During the season, tropical cyclones were officially monitored by the [[Fiji Meteorological Service]] (FMS), Australian [[Bureau of Meteorology]] (BOM) and New Zealand's [[MetService]]. The [[United States Armed Forces]] through the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] <small>(JTWC)</small> also monirors the basin and issue unofficial warnings for American interests. The FMS attaches a number and an F suffix to tropical disturbances that form in or move into the basin while the JTWC designates significant tropical cyclones with a number and a P suffix. The FMS, BoM and MetService all use the [[Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale]] and estimate wind speeds over a period of ten minutes, while the JTWC estimated sustained winds over a 1-minute period, which are subsequently compared to the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale]] <small>(SSHWS)</small>.\n\n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n==Seasonal forecasts==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right\"\n|- \n!

Rita would then peak as a Category 3 on the [[Australian scale]]. Tropical Disturbance 02F was designated sometime later, but didn't last long after that. Sarai formed on December 23, lasting into the new year before finally ceasing to exist on January 2. Not too long after that, Tino formed and affected eastern [[Fiji]] and the surrounding area before dissipating. On January 24, a depression formed and dissipated the next day without been named. In early February, another low originally in the Australian region crossed the [[160th meridian east]] and emerged in the South Pacific. It strengthened into severe tropical cyclone Uesi and affected New Caledonia and New Zealand. In mid-February four disturbances formed, 07F, 08F, 09F and 10F. 07F & 08F dissipated before becoming tropical depressions but the other 2 strengthened into tropical cyclones Vicky and Wasi. In mid March, Gretel entered the basin. It dissipated shortly afterwards. In early April, Harold also entered the basin from the Australian region. It rapidly intensified into a Category 5 Severe tropical cyclone as it impacted [[Vanuatu]].\n\n==Systems==\n===Severe Tropical Cyclone Rita===\n{{Infobox tropical cyclone small\n|Basin=SPac\n|Image=Rita 2019-11-24 2240Z.jpg\n|Track=Rita 2019 track.png\n|Formed=November 22\n|Dissipated=November 26\n|10-min winds=65\n|1-min winds=65\n|Pressure=977\n}}\n\nBeginning November 21, the [[Fiji Meteorological Service]] (FMS) began highlighting the likelihood of a [[tropical cyclone]] forming between [[Vanuatu]] and [[Fiji]].<ref name=\"5Day_21Nov\">{{cite report|title=Tropical Cyclone - 5 Day Outlook (21 November 2019)|type=5 Day Outlook|publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service |location=Nadi, Fiji|date=November 21, 2019}}</ref> Showers and thunderstorms began to aggregate in the region atop [[sea surface temperature]]s above {{cvt|29|C|F}} in low-[[wind shear]] conditions.<ref name=\"TDS_22Nov1930\">{{cite report|type=Tropical Disturbance Summary|title=Tropical Disturbance Summary for 22 November 0930 UTC |publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service |date=November 22, 2019}}</ref> Imagery from [[Microwave radiometer|microwave satellite data]] showed emergent [[rainband]]s wrapping towards an organising [[low-pressure area|center of low pressure]].<ref>{{cite report|title=Significant Tropical Weather Advisory for the Western and South Pacific Oceans (November 22 2000 UTC) |publisher=United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center  |date=November 22, 2019}}</ref> Late on November 22, the FMS designated the system, now east of the [[Solomon Islands]], as Tropical Disturbance 01F.<ref name=\"TDS_22Nov2100\">{{cite report|type=Tropical Disturbance Summary|title=Tropical Disturbance Summary for November 22 2100 UTC |publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service |date=November 22, 2019}}</ref> The slow-moving disturbance tracked towards the south and southeast,<ref>{{cite report|title=Tropical Disturbance Advisory Number A1 for Tropical Depression 01F|publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service |date=November 23, 2019}}</ref> steered by a broad [[subtropical ridge|area of high pressure]].

All [[COVID-19]] preparedness activities were suspended to facilitate preparations and evacuations for Harold. Harold was the first Category 5 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian scale to strike Vanuatu since [[Cyclone Pam]] in [[2014\u201315 South Pacific cyclone season|2015]], bringing gusts above 275 km/h (170 mph), 250\u2013450 mm (10\u201318 in) of rain, and a storm surge of 0.8 m (2.6 ft) causing catastrophic damage, torrential flooding and communication disruptions and plunging Vanuatu into a blackout.\n\n[[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] (IFRC) granted 50,000 [[Swiss franc|CHF]] from its Disaster Relief Emergency Fund to the Vanuatu Red Cross Society to help better position staff and aid resources prior to the storm's arrival, mobilizing over a thousand volunteers. Preparing for the storm in [[Luganville]], hundreds of people were sent into evacuation centres before the storm. The Torba provincial headquarters in [[Sola, Vanuatu|Sola]] served as a shelter for families. Development organisation [[Oxfam Australia]] coordinated with Vanuatuan agencies to develop a response plan for Harold. The Australian [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] also devised a support package for both the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.\n\nIn [[Fiji]], heavy rain alerts were issued for the western half of [[Viti Levu]], [[Kadavu Island|Kadavu]], and the [[Mamanuca Islands|Mamanuca]] and [[Yasawa Islands|Yasawa]] islands on April 6. Storm warnings were later put in effect for the areas under a heavy rain alert, in addition to the [[Lomaiviti Islands]]. The highest warning, a hurricane warning, was issued for Kadavu and [[Ono-i-Lau]] on April 7. The Fiji National Disaster Management Office (FDNMO) activated their Emergency Operations Centre to streamline preparations and evacuations. A total of eighty-five shelters were opened, with at least two in each of Fiji's four districts. All village headmen and community leaders were directed to. All COVID-19-related activities were also cancelled in order to prepare for the impact of Harold. Early on April 7, the storm began affecting the nation with gusty winds, moderate coastal flooding, and storm surge. These conditioners worsened as the storm approached. In contrast to the forecasts, the passed only to the south of Fiji and thus, the northern islands received little damage.

the [[South Pacific Ocean]] to the east of 160\u00b0E. The season officially runs from November 1, 2019 to April 30, 2020, however a tropical cyclone could form at any time between July 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020 and would count towards the season total. During the season, tropical cyclones will be  officially monitored by the [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Center]] (RSMC) in [[Fiji Meteorological Service|Nadi, Fiji]] and the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centers in [[Bureau of Meteorology|Brisbane, Australia]] and [[Meteorological Service of New Zealand Limited|Wellington, New Zealand]]. The [[United States Armed Forces]] through the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] <small>(JTWC)</small> will also monitor the basin and issue unofficial warnings for American interests. RSMC Nadi attaches a number and an F suffix to tropical disturbances that form in or move into the basin while the JTWC designates significant tropical cyclones with a number and a P suffix. RSMC Nadi, TCWC Wellington and TCWC Brisbane all use the [[Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale]] and estimate windspeeds over a period of ten minutes, while the JTWC estimated sustained winds over a 1-minute period, which are subsequently compared to the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale]] <small>(SSHWS)</small>.\n\n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n==Seasonal forecasts==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right\"\n|- \n!

Rita would then peak as a Category 3 on the [[Australian scale]]. Tropical Disturbance 02F was designated sometime later, but didn't last long after that. Sarai formed on December 23, lasting into the new year before finally ceasing to exist on January 2. Not too long after that, Tino formed and affected eastern [[Fiji]] and the surrounding area before dissipating. On January 24, a depression formed and dissipated the next day without been named. In early February, another low originally in the Australian region crossed the [[160th meridian east]] and emerged in the South Pacific. It strengthened into severe tropical cyclone Uesi and affected New Caledonia and New Zealand. In mid-February four disturbances formed, 07F, 08F, 09F and 10F. 07F & 08F dissipated before becoming tropical depressions but the other 2 strengthened into tropical cyclones Vicky and Wasi. In mid March, Gretel entered the basin. It dissipated shortly afterwards. In early April, Harold also entered the basin from the Australian region. It rapidly intensified into a Category 5 Severe tropical cyclone as it impacted [[Vanuatu]].\n\n==Systems==\n===Severe Tropical Cyclone Rita===\n{{Infobox tropical cyclone small\n|Basin=SPac\n|Image=Rita 2019-11-24 2240Z.jpg\n|Track=Rita 2019 track.png\n|Formed=November 22\n|Dissipated=November 26\n|10-min winds=65\n|1-min winds=65\n|Pressure=977\n}}\n\nBeginning November 21, the [[Fiji Meteorological Service]] (FMS) began highlighting the likelihood of a [[tropical cyclone]] forming between [[Vanuatu]] and [[Fiji]].<ref name=\"5Day_21Nov\">{{cite report|title=Tropical Cyclone - 5 Day Outlook (21 November 2019)|type=5 Day Outlook|publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service |location=Nadi, Fiji|date=November 21, 2019}}</ref> Showers and thunderstorms began to aggregate in the region atop [[sea surface temperature]]s above {{cvt|29|C|F}} in low-[[wind shear]] conditions.<ref name=\"TDS_22Nov1930\">{{cite report|type=Tropical Disturbance Summary|title=Tropical Disturbance Summary for 22 November 0930 UTC |publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service |date=November 22, 2019}}</ref> Imagery from [[Microwave radiometer|microwave satellite data]] showed emergent [[rainband]]s wrapping towards an organising [[low-pressure area|center of low pressure]].<ref>{{cite report|title=Significant Tropical Weather Advisory for the Western and South Pacific Oceans (November 22 2000 UTC) |publisher=United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center  |date=November 22, 2019}}</ref> Late on November 22, the FMS designated the system, now east of the [[Solomon Islands]], as Tropical Disturbance 01F.<ref name=\"TDS_22Nov2100\">{{cite report|type=Tropical Disturbance Summary|title=Tropical Disturbance Summary for November 22 2100 UTC |publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service |date=November 22, 2019}}</ref> The slow-moving disturbance tracked towards the south and southeast,<ref>{{cite report|title=Tropical Disturbance Advisory Number A1 for Tropical Depression 01F|publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service |date=November 23, 2019}}</ref> steered by a broad [[subtropical ridge|area of high pressure]].

All [[COVID-19]] preparedness activities were suspended to facilitate preparations and evacuations for Harold. Harold was the first Category 5 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian scale to strike Vanuatu since [[Cyclone Pam]] in [[2014\u201315 South Pacific cyclone season|2015]], bringing gusts above 275 km/h (170 mph), 250\u2013450 mm (10\u201318 in) of rain, and a storm surge of 0.8 m (2.6 ft) causing catastrophic damage, torrential flooding and communication disruptions and plunging Vanuatu into a blackout.\n\n[[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] (IFRC) granted 50,000 [[Swiss franc|CHF]] from its Disaster Relief Emergency Fund to the Vanuatu Red Cross Society to help better position staff and aid resources prior to the storm's arrival, mobilizing over a thousand volunteers. Preparing for the storm in [[Luganville]], hundreds of people were sent into evacuation centres before the storm. The Torba provincial headquarters in [[Sola, Vanuatu|Sola]] served as a shelter for families. Development organisation [[Oxfam Australia]] coordinated with Vanuatuan agencies to develop a response plan for Harold. The Australian [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] also devised a support package for both the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.\n\nIn [[Fiji]], heavy rain alerts were issued for the western half of [[Viti Levu]], [[Kadavu Island|Kadavu]], and the [[Mamanuca Islands|Mamanuca]] and [[Yasawa Islands|Yasawa]] islands on April 6. Storm warnings were later put in effect for the areas under a heavy rain alert, in addition to the [[Lomaiviti Islands]]. The highest warning, a hurricane warning, was issued for Kadavu and [[Ono-i-Lau]] on April 7. The Fiji National Disaster Management Office (FDNMO) activated their Emergency Operations Centre to streamline preparations and evacuations. A total of eighty-five shelters were opened, with at least two in each of Fiji's four districts. All village headmen and community leaders were directed to. All COVID-19-related activities were also cancelled in order to prepare for the impact of Harold. Early on April 7, the storm began affecting the nation with gusty winds, moderate coastal flooding, and storm surge. These conditioners worsened as the storm approached.

{"title_page": "2nd Portuguese India Armada (Cabral, 1500)", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=June 2010}}\n[[File:Pedro Alvares Cabral.jpg|thumb|Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]]\nThe '''Second [[Portuguese India Armadas|Portuguese India Armada]]''' was assembled in 1500 on the order of King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] and placed under the command of [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]].  Cabral's armada famously discovered [[Brazil]] for the Portuguese crown along the way. By and large, the 2nd Armada's diplomatic mission to [[India]] failed, and provoked the opening of hostilities between the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] and the feudal city-state of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]].  Nonetheless, it managed to establish a factory in the nearby [[Kingdom of Cochin]], the first Portuguese [[Factory (trading post)|factory]] in Asia.\n\n== Fleet ==\n\nThe [[1st Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1497)|first India Armada]], commanded by [[Vasco da Gama]], arrived in Portugal in the summer of 1499, in rather sorry shape. Half of his ships and men had been lost thanks to battles, disease, and storms. Although Gama came back with a hefty cargo of spices that would be sold at enormous profit, he had failed in the principal objective of his mission: to negotiate a treaty with [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], the spice entrep\u00f4t on the [[Malabar Coast]] of India. Gama managed, however, to open the [[Portuguese India Armadas|sea route to India]] via the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and secured good relations with the African city-state of [[Malindi]], a critical staging post along the way.\n\nOn the orders of King [[Manuel I of Portugal]], arrangements were immediately made to begin the assembly of a second armada in [[Cascais]].  Determined not to repeat Gama's mistakes, this one was to be a large and well-armed fleet of 13 ships and 1500 men, laden with valuable gifts and diplomatic letters to win over the potentates of the east.\n\nMany details of the composition of the fleet are missing. Only three ship names are known, and there is some conflict among the sources on the captains.  The following list of ships should not be regarded as authoritative, but as a tentative list compiled from various conflicting accounts.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\" cellpadding=5\n|style=\"border-bottom:3px solid; background:#efefef;\"|'''Ship Name''' ||style=\"border-bottom:3px solid; background:#efefef;\"|'''Captain'''||style=\"border-bottom:3px solid; background:#efefef;\"|'''Notes'''\n|- valign = top\n| 1. uncertain || D.

Oddly, Couto inserts [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] in place of Sim\u00e3o de Pina, but subsequently corrects himself.  All the chroniclers\u2014Castanheda, Barros, etc.\u2014name Gaspar de Lemos instead of Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves.

The other great deviant is the ''Livro de Lisuarte d'Abreu'' (1563), which introduces four new names: Diogo de Figueir\u00f3, Jo\u00e3o Fernandes, Ruy de Miranda, and Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves, who replace P. d'Ataide, A.

Cabral had no notable naval or military experience; his appointment as ''capit\u00e3o-mor'' (captain-major) of the armada was largely a political one.  The exiled [[Crown of Castile|Castillian]] nobleman [[Sancho de Tovar]] was designated vice-admiral (''soto-capit\u00e3o'') and Cabral's successor should anything happen to him.<ref group=note>This is according to Castanheda and Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is. Gaspar Correia identifies Sim\u00e3o de Miranda as the predesignated successor instead.</ref>\n\nVeteran pilot [[Pedro Escobar]] was given the overall technical command of the expedition. Other veterans of the [[1st Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1497)|first (1497) armada]] include captain [[Nicolau Coelho]], pilot [[P\u00earo de Alenquer]], and clerks Afonso Lopes and [[Jo\u00e3o de S\u00e1]].  The famed navigator [[Bartolomeu Dias]], who was the first to double the Cape of Good Hope back in 1488, and his brother [[Diogo Dias]], who had served as clerk on Gama's ship in the first expedition, also served as captains in the trip. \n\nMost of the ships were either [[carracks]] (''naus'') or [[caravels]], and at least one was a small supply ship, although details on names and tonnage are missing.<ref group=note>Castanheda (1551) claims there were ten carracks and three caravels. The Anonymous Pilot refers to only twelve ships, plus a supply ship.</ref>  At least two ships, Cabral's flagship and Tovar's ''El Rei'', were said to be around 240 tons, that is, about twice the size of the largest ship in the first armada three years prior.\n\nTen ships were destined for [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (Malabar, India), while the two ships headed by the Dias brothers were destined for [[Sofala]] in East Africa and the supply ship was destined to be scuttled and burnt along the way.<ref group=note>The Sofala destination of the Dias brothers is found in Castanheda (1551).  It is confirmed in the Anonymous Pilot.</ref>\n\n[[File:Cabral armada of 1500 (Livro das Armadas).jpg|thumb|250px|left|Fleet of the 2nd India Armada (Cabral, 1500), from the ''Mem\u00f3ria das Armadas'']]\n\nAt least two ships were privately owned and outfitted: Lu\u00eds Pires's ship was owned by Diogo da Silva e Meneses, [[Count of Portalegre]], while Nuno Leit\u00e3o da Cunha's ''Anunciada'' was owned by the king's cousin D. [[\u00c1lvaro of Braganza]], and financed by an Italian consortium composed of the Florentine bankers [[Bartolomeo Marchionni]] and [[Girolamo Sernigi]] and the Genoese Antonio Salvago. The remainder belonged to the [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese crown]].\n\nAccompanying the expedition as translator was [[Gaspar da Gama]], who was a Jew captured in Angediva by Vasco Gama, as well as four Hindu hostages from Calicut taken by Gama in 1498 during negotiations. Also aboard was the ambassador of the Sultan of Malindi, who had arrived at Portugal with Gama, and was set to return to Malindi with Cabral's expedition.\n\nOther passengers on the expedition included Aires Correia, the designated [[Factor (agent)|factor]] for Calicut, his secretary [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]], Afonso Furtado, the designated factor for Sofala, and clerk Martinho Neto.  Accompanying them on the trip was the royal physician and amateur astronomer, Master [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]], who brought along the latest [[astrolabe]] and new Arabic astronomical staves for navigational experiments.  One chronicler suggests that the knight [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] was also aboard.<ref group=note>[[Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is]] is the chronicler responsible for this claim.  This is not substantiated elsewhere.  Greenlee (1938, p. li) and Diffie and Winius (1977, p. 188fn) dismiss the possibility.</ref>\n\nThe fleet carried some twenty Portuguese ''[[degredado|degredados]]'', who were criminal convicts who could fulfill their sentences by being abandoned along the shores of various places and exploring inland on the crown's behalf. Four of the degredados are known: Afonso Ribeiro, Jo\u00e3o Machado, Luiz de Moura, and Antonio Fernandes, who was also a ship carpenter. \n\nFinally, the fleet carried eight [[Franciscan]] friars and eight chaplains, under the supervision of the head chaplain, Fr. Henrique Soares of Coimbra. They were the first Portuguese Christian missionaries to India.\n\nThere are three surviving eyewitness accounts of this expedition: (1) an extended letter written by [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]] (possibly dictated by Aires Correia), written from Brazil on May 1, 1500, to King Manuel I; (2) the brief letter by Mestre [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]] to the king, also from Brazil; and (3) the account of an anonymous Portuguese pilot, first published in Italian in 1507 (commonly referred to as the ''Rela\u00e7\u00e3o do Piloto An\u00f4nimo'', sometimes believed to be the clerk [[Jo\u00e3o de S\u00e1]]).\n\n== Mission ==\n\nCabral's instructions were several-fold. The priority was to secure a treaty with [[Zamorin]]'s [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (''Calecute'', Kozhikode), the principal commercial entrep\u00f4t of the [[Kerala]] spice trade and dominant feudal city-state on the [[Malabar coast]] of [[India]]. [[Vasco da Gama]]'s first armada had visited Calicut in 1498, but had failed to impress the elderly ruling Manivikraman Raja ('Samoothiri Raja'), the [[Zamorin of Calicut]]. As such, no agreements had been signed. Cabral's instructions were to succeed where Gama had failed, and to this end was entrusted with magnificent gifts to present to the Zamorin. Cabral was under orders to establish a ''feitoria'' ([[Factory (trading post)|factory]]) in Calicut, which would be placed under Aires Correia.\n\nThe second priority, assigned to the brothers [[Bartolomeu Dias|Bartolomeu]] and [[Diogo Dias]], was to search out the East African port of [[Sofala]], near the mouth of the [[Zambezi]] river.<ref>Anonymous Pilot, p. 107</ref> Sofala had been secretly visited and described by the explorer [[P\u00earo da Covilh\u00e3]] during his overland expedition a decade earlier (c. 1487), and he identified it as the endpoint of the [[Monomatapa]] gold trade.  The Portuguese crown was eager to tap into that gold source, but Gama's armada had failed to find it.  The Dias brothers were instructed to find and establish a factory at Sofala under designated factor Afonso Furtado.  To this end, the brothers were likely also instructed to secure the consent of [[Kilwa Sultanate|Kilwa]] (''Qu\u00edloa''), the dominant city-state of the East African coast and putative overlord of Sofala.  Like Sofala, Kilwa had been visited by Covilh\u00e3, but not by da Gama.\n\nA minor objective included the delivery of a group of [[Franciscan]] missionaries to India. It is said that Vasco da Gama had misinterpreted the [[Hinduism]] he saw practiced in India as a form of \"primitive\" Christianity.  He believed its peculiar characteristics were a result of centuries of separation from the mainstream church in Europe. As such, Gama recommended that missionaries be sent to India to help bring the practices of the \"Hindu church\" up to date with Roman Catholic orthodoxy.  To this end, a group of Franciscan friars, led by Fr. Henrique Soares of Coimbra, joined the expedition.\n\nAs a final objective, the Second Armada was also a commercial spice run. The crown and private merchants who had outfitted the ships expected full cargoes of spices to return to Lisbon. \n\n=== Suspected Brazilian mission ===\n\nThere has been some debate over whether [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] also had secret instructions from King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] to lay claim to the landmass of [[Brazil]]\u2014or, more precisely, to swing as far west as possible to the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas line]] and claim whatever lands or islands might be discovered there for the Portuguese crown, before the Spanish did.<ref>{{cite book|last=Peres |first=Dami\u00e3o |date=1949 |title=O descobrimento do Brasil por Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral: antecedentes e intencionalidade |language=Portuguese}}</ref> Among the pieces of evidence is an indication of an island in the area in a 1448 map of [[Andrea Bianco]], apparently alluded to in the letter of Master Jo\u00e3o Faras; there is also the suggestion by [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] in his ''Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis'' that he had been sent on an expedition to a western landmass in 1498.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pacheco Pereira |first=Duarte |date=c. 1505 |title=Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis |url=https://archive.org/details/esmeraldodesitu00peregoog/page/n62/mode/2up |chapter=Cap 2: Da cantidade & grandeza da terra, & daugua qual destas he a mayor parte. |language=Portuguese}}</ref> That is about the full extent of the evidence of intentionality and this claim is largely speculative.<ref>{{cite book|last=Greenlee |first=William Brooks |date=1938 |pages=l\u2013lv |title=The Voyage of Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral to Brazil and India: from contemporary documents and narratives |publisher=Routledge |isbn=1409414485}}</ref> In particular, there is little evidence of any such instructions from the King, and there are various reasons to presume them unlikely.\n\nSpanish explorers had certainly been tending south lately. [[Christopher Columbus]] had touched the coast of the South American mainland around [[Guyana]] in 1498 on his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus#Third voyage|third trip]]. In late 1499, [[Alonso de Ojeda]] had discovered much of the [[Venezuela|Venezuelan]], with one of his squadrons, under [[Amerigo Vespucci]], who was exploring parts of what is now northern Brazil.  In early 1500, [[Vicente Y\u00e1\u00f1ez Pinz\u00f3n]] and [[Diego de Lepe]], via generous southerly swings from the [[Canary islands]], had reached at least what is now modern [[Cear\u00e1]], perhaps as far east as [[Cabo de Santo Agostinho|Cape of Santo Agostinho]] in [[Pernambuco]]. They had explored much of the northern Brazilian coast west of it. It is possible that the southerly Spanish tendencies were deliberate, aimed at securing more land for the Spanish crown.<ref group=note>Although the person from whom the Spanish crown was trying to claim land was not the king of Portugal, as that was already mediated by Tordesillas, but Christopher Columbus, their own vice-roy of the Indies. Ojeda, Pinz\u00f3n, and Lepe were all dispatched on separate royal capitulations by [[Juan Rodr\u00edguez de Fonseca|Bishop Fonseca]], an enemy of Columbus, with the deliberate intent of finding and claiming lands ''outside'' (i.e., to the south) of the Columbus-owned West Indian islands, thereby circumscribing Columbus's viceroyalty and limiting him to the islands he already had. This would figure in later lawsuits by the Columbus family.</ref>\n\nHowever, these Spanish expeditions were much too recent for their results to have been known in Lisbon before Cabral's departure in March 1500; indeed, they were unknown in Spain itself\u2014at that moment, Ojeda was still in [[Hispaniola]], and Pinz\u00f3n and Lepe were still out at sea.  It is very doubtful that the Portuguese were aware of them.  Even if they were, it would not seem sensible to alter Cabral's large and heavy Second Armada, prepared for an important mission to India, to satisfy the pursuit some open-ended exploratory work in unknown waters which could have been far more efficiently accomplished by a smaller caravels. \n\n== Outward journey ==\n\n[[File:Cabral armada of 1500 (Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu).jpg|thumb|350px|Fleet of the 2nd India Armada (Cabral, 1500), from the ''Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu'']]\nMarch 9, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's expedition, the 2nd India Armada of 13 ships, sets out from the Tagus.\n\nMarch 22, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's armada reaches [[Cape Verde]] island of [[S\u00e3o Nicolau, Cape Verde|S\u00e3o Nicolau]] in the middle of a storm.  The privately outfitted ship of Lu\u00eds Pires is too damaged by the tempest to continue, and returns to Lisbon<ref>According to Barros (1552, II.5.2 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Epo2AAAAMAAJ&dq=editions%3AUOM39015057112644&lr&as_brr=1&pg=PA386#v=onepage&q&f=false p.386]); also Castanheda (1551), G\u00f3is (1566).</ref> (Note: Caminha's letter (see below) makes no mention of Pires and instead reports that it was the crown ship of Vasco de Ataide was lost around Cape Verde.)\n\nFrom Cape Verde, Cabral strikes southwest.  The reasons for this unusual direction have been speculated upon endlessly. The most probable hypothesis is that Cabral was simply following the wide arc in the South Atlantic to catch a favorable wind to carry them to the Cape of Good Hope.\n\n[Navigationally, the arc is perfectly sensible: from Cape Verde, the ship cuts across the [[doldrums]] below the equator, catches the southwest-bound [[South Equatorial Current|equatorial drift]], turns into the southbound [[Brazil Current]] that will carry them down to the [[horse latitudes]] (30\u00b0S), where the prevailing [[westerlies]] begin.  The westerlies will then carry them quickly straight across the South Atlantic around the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. In almost all of this trajectory, the sailing ship is going with the current and usually upwind.  If instead of his arc, a ship attempts to strike southeast from Cape Verde, it will go into the [[Gulf of Guinea]], and from there to the Cape of Good Hope is a struggle\u2014it means sailing against the southeasterly [[trade wind]]s, and fighting against the [[Benguela Current]] to go south\u2014a much slower and more painful route, especially for square-rigged heavy ships which cannot [[tacking (sailing)|tack]] easily.]\n\nHow did Cabral know about this arc?  The most probable answer is that this was precisely the route followed by Vasco da Gama on his first trip in 1497. The veterans of the first fleet\u2014notably the pilots [[P\u00earo de Alenquer]] and [[Pedro Escobar]]\u2014would very likely have charted the same route for Cabral again.<ref>That this arc was sailed by Gama in 1497 is uncertain, but most modern historians have come to accept that he did.  How did Gama know about the arc when no one had yet sailed it before?  Some have speculated that the Portuguese crown might have dispatched secret exploratory expeditions to those waters in advance.  But, in the more widely accepted hypothesis, first forwarded by admiral [[Gago Coutinho]], it is more straightforward: since [[Bartolomeu Dias]]'s 1488 expedition discovered the [[westerlies]], the South Atlantic arc became 'navigationally obvious' to any sensible pilot, especially pilots as experienced as Alenquer and Escobar. See Gago Coutinho (1951\u201352) ''A Nautica dos Descobrimentos: os descobrimentos maritimos visitos por um navegador'', 2 vols., Lisbon: Agencia Geral do Ultramar.</ref>  Indeed, in the Lisbon archives, there is a draft of a document based on Gama and intended for Cabral that gives the essential instruction: to strike in a southwesterly direction when he reaches the doldrums.<ref>After Cape Verde, where the wind is weak ('vento escasso') the ships should strike in the open ocean arc ('ir na volta do mar'), until the Cape of Good Hope, as this is the shorter route ('a navega\u00e7\u00e3o ser\u00e1 mais breve').  See Fonseca (1908: p.211; see also p.224) [https://books.google.com/books?id=A7lI4gqh7PsC&pg=PA208#v=onepage&q&f=false copy of letter]; see also Greenlee (1938: p.167)</ref>  The difference is that this time the arc was a little wider, Cabral went further west than Gama had, and as a result hit upon the hitherto unknown landmass of [[Brazil]].\n\nAlternative hypotheses forwarded for Cabral striking southwest have been (1.) that Cabral was trying to reach the [[Azores]] to repair his storm-battered fleet; (2.) that he was searching for and rounding up missing tempest-tossed ships; (3.) the hypothesis, already considered above, that it was an intentional attempt to discover if there was any land by the Tordesillas line.\n\n=== Discovery of Brazil ===\n{{Cleanup-tense|date=July 2012}}\nApril 21, 1500 \u2013 After nearly 30 days of sailing (44 since departure), on April 21 (a Tuesday in the [[octave of Easter]]),<ref>Fonseca (1908: p.225)</ref> Cabral's fleet finds the first indications of nearby land.\n\nApril 22, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's armada sights the Brazilian coast, seeing the outlines of a hill they name [[Monte Pascoal]] (some 60&nbsp;km south of modern [[Porto Seguro]], [[Bahia]]).\n\nApril 23, 1500 \u2013 The armada anchors at the mouth of the [[Do Frade River|Frade river]] and a group of local [[Tupiniquim]] Indians assembles on the beach. Cabral dispatches a small party, headed by [[Nicolau Coelho]], in a longboat ashore to make first contact.  Coelho tosses his hat in exchange for a feathered headdress, but the surf is too strong for a proper landing and opening of communication, and so they return to the ships.<ref>Fonseca (1908: p.241-42)</ref>\n\nApril 23\u201324, 1500 \u2013 Strong overnight winds on prompt the armada to lift anchor and sail some 10 leagues (45&nbsp;km) north, finding harbor behind the reef at Cabr\u00e1lia Bay, just north of [[Porto Seguro]].  The pilot Afonso Lopes goes [[Sounding line|sounding]] in a rowboat. He spies a native canoe, captures the two Indians on board, and brings them back to ship.  The language barrier prevents questioning, but they are fed and given cloth and beads. The cultural differences were staggering, fed with honey and cake, they spit them out and were deeply surprised with the sight of a chicken.<ref>Guia politicamente incorreto da Hist\u00f3ria do Brasil, Leandro Narloch</ref>\n\nApril 25, 1500 \u2013 The next day a party led by [[Nicolau Coelho]] and [[Bartolomeu Dias]] goes ashore, accompanied by the two natives.  Armed Tupiniquim warily approach the beach, but on a signal from the two natives, lay down their bows, and allow the Portuguese to land and collect water.\n\n[[File:Meirelles-primeiramissa2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The First Mass in Brazil'' by [[Victor Meirelles]] (1861).]]\nApril 26, 1500 \u2013 (Octave of Easter Sunday) Franciscan friar Henrique Soares of Coimbra goes ashore to celebrate mass, curiously watched by some 200 Tupiniquim Indians.  It is the first known Christian mass on the American mainland.\n\nFor much of the week, interaction between the Portuguese and the Tupiniquim gradually increases.  There is a brisk trade in European iron nails, cloth, beads and crucifixes in return for American amulets, spears, parrots and monkeys. There is only the slightest hint that precious metals might be found in the hinterlands. Portuguese ''[[degredado]]s'' are assigned to spend the night in Tupiniquim villages, while the remainder of the crews sleep aboard ships.\n\n[[File:Carta-caminha.png|thumb|150px|Facsimile of the letter of [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]] to  King [[Manuel I of Portugal]], reporting the discovery of the 'Island of the True Cross\" (Brazil)]]\nMay 1, 1500 \u2013 Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral makes preparations to resume the journey to India. The Portuguese pilots, assisted by the physician-astronomer Master Jo\u00e3o Faras and his astronomical instruments, determine that the land lies east of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas line]], prompting Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral to formally claim Brazil for the Portuguese crown, bestowing upon it the name of ''Ilha de Vera Cruz'' (\"Island  of the True Cross\"\u2014later renamed ''Terra de Santa Cruz'', \"Land of the Holy Cross\", upon the realization that it is not an island).<ref>Gaspar Correia ([https://books.google.com/books?id=YmVKAAAAYAAJ&dq=editions%3ALCCN05022145&as_brr=1&pg=PA152#v=onepage&q&f=false p.152]) and Jo\u00e3o de Barros ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Epo2AAAAMAAJ&dq=editions%3AUOM39015057112644&lr&as_brr=1&pg=PA391#v=onepage&q&f=false p.391]) say it was named \"Santa Cruz\" from the start, with Correia noting it was named so because May 3 (the departure date) was the [[Feast of the Cross]] on the liturgical calendar.  But the letters of Caminha and Mestre Jo\u00e3o are both signed as written from \"Vera Cruz\" on May 1.</ref>\n\nOn May 2, 1500, Cabral dispatches the supply ship (captained either by [[Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves (explorer)|Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves]] or [[Gaspar de Lemos]]\u2014chronicles conflict on this<ref>Jo\u00e3o de Barros (1552: p.390) and Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is (1566: p.69) say Gaspar de Lemos; Gaspar Correia (c.1550: p.152) says Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves.

The fleet faces headlong winds for six straight days. Four ships are lost at sea in the process\u2014most tragically, the Sofala-destined ship of [[Bartolomeu Dias]].  The famous navigator, the first to round the Cape back in 1488, fatally fails to round it this time. The three others are the crown-owned ships of Aires Gomes da Silva, Sim\u00e3o de Pina and Vasco de Ata\u00edde <ref>Castanheda (1551), Barros (1552) and G\u00f3is (1566) all identify the same four (B. Dias, A. Gomes da Silva, S. da Pina, V. d' Ata\u00edde) as lost at the Cape.  The ''Rela\u00e7ao das Naos'' mistakenly substitutes Sim\u00e3o de Miranda for Sim\u00e3o da Pina in the losses, although this is corrected in the marginal gloss. Gaspar Correia (1550) almost concurs\u2014but as he does not have Aires Gomes da Silva on his original captain list, he identifies the fourth ship lost as Gaspar de Lemos.   Analogously, the ''Livro de Lisuarte d'Abreu'' (1563), which doesn't have Pina nor Gomes da Silva on its list, say it was Diogo de Figueir\u00f3 and Luis Pires who were lost (in addition to Vasco d'Ata\u00edde and Bartolomeu Dias).  Diogo do Couto (c.1600) mistakenly adds P\u00earo d'Ataide to the list, bringing the losses to five.</ref> (if Ata\u00edde had not been lost earlier at Cape Verde, he is certainly lost now; some scholars contend Pires was lost now, and Ata\u00edde was lost earlier).  In any case, the fleet is reduced to seven ships.  Facing strong winds, the seven split into smaller groups, to meet again on the other side.  Cabral holds two ships together with his own.\n\nJune 16, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's battered three-ship squadron reaches the [[Primeiras and Segundas Archipelago|Primeiras Islands]] (several leagues north of Sofala).  Two local merchant ships, catching sight of Cabral, take flight.  Cabral gives pursuit\u2014one of them runs aground and the other is captured.  Questioning quickly determines that these ships are owned by a cousin of the sultan Fateima of [[Malindi]] (who had received Vasco da Gama so graciously back in 1498), so they are released without harm.\n\nJune 22, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's three-ship squadron hobble on to [[Mozambique Island]].  Despite the earlier quarrel with Gama, Cabral is given an unexpectedly warm reception by the Sultan of Mozambique, and allowed to collect water and supplies.  Shortly after, three more ships of the 2nd Armada sail into Mozambique island and make junction with Cabral.  Only the ship of [[Diogo Dias]] (Bartolomeu's brother) remains missing.  As Dias's mission was for Sofala anyway, Cabral decides not to wait for it but rather to press on with his current fleet of six ships.\n\n[[File:Map of Cabral route, 1500.gif|thumb|340px|Approximate route of outward journey of Cabral's 2nd Armada (also route of stray ship of Diogo Dias)]]\nJuly 26, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's armada reaches the city-state of [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]] (''Qu\u00edloa''), the dominant city of the East African coast (which Gama had never visited).  Afonso Furtado, who had been appointed factor for Sofala back in Lisbon and mercifully escaped death (Furtado had been aboard Bartolomeu Dias's ship, but moved to the flagship just before the Cape crossing), goes ashore to open negotiations with the strongman ruler, Emir Ibrahim  [Note: There is no current ruling [[Kilwa Sultanate|Sultan of Kilwa]]\u2014the last one, al-Fudail, was deposed in a coup (c. 1495) by his minister, Emir Ibrahim, who had since ruled Kilwa with a vacant throne.]\n\nA meeting is arranged between Cabral and Emir Ibrahim, conducted on a couple of rowboats in Kilwa harbor.  Cabral presents a letter from King Manuel I proposing a treaty, but Emir Ibrahim is suspicious and, for all the formal pleasantries, resistant to the overtures.  Cabral, feeling there's nothing to be achieved here and worried about missing the [[monsoon]] winds to India, decides to break off the negotiations and sail on.\n\nAugust 2, 1500, Pressing north, the Cabral fleet avoid hostile [[Mombassa]] (''Momba\u00e7a'') and finally reach friendly [[Malindi]] (''Melinde'').  There he drops off the Malindi ambassador that Gama had taken the previous year.  The Sultan of Malindi gives Cabral an excellent reception. Leaving behind  two ''degredados'' (Lu\u00eds de Moura and Jo\u00e3o Machado) and picking up two Gujarati pilots, Cabral's six-ship armada finally begins its Indian Ocean crossing on August 7.\n\n== Cabral in India ==\n{{Refimprove-section|date=April 2020}}\nAugust 22, 1500 \u2013 After an uneventful ocean crossing, Cabral's six ships land in [[Anjediva Island]] (''Angediva'', Anjadip), where they rest and recuperate, repair and repaint the ships.\n\nSeptember 13, 1500 \u2013 Sailing down the Indian coast, Cabral's expedition finally reaches at [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (''Calecute'', Kozhikode, the capital of the [[Nair]] [[Hindu]] kingdom of same name ruled by Zamorins, or Nediyuiruppu Swarupam). Gaily decorated native boats come out to greet them, but remembering Gama's experience, Cabral refuses to go ashore until hostages are exchanged.  He dispatches Afonso Furtado and the four Calicut hostages taken by Gama the previous year, to negotiate the details of the landing. This eventually done, Cabral finally goes ashore himself and meets new [[Zamorin]] of Calicut (the wary old Zamorin that Gama had met, had recently died). The Portuguese are better-prepared this time\u2014Cabral presents the young Zamorin with much finer and more luxurious gifts than Gama had brought, and more respectful and personalized letters of address from King [[Manuel I of Portugal]].\n\nA commercial treaty is successfully negotiated, and the Zamorin gives Cabral a security-of-trade certificate etched on a silver plate. The Portuguese are allowed to establish a ''[[Factory (trading post)|feitoria]]'' in Calicut and Aires Correia, the designated factor for Calicut, goes ashore with some 70 men. Once the factory is set up, Cabral releases the ship hostages as a sign of trust. Correia immediately sets about buying spices in Calicut's markets for the ships to take home.\n\nOctober (?), 1500 \u2013 Not long after, the Zamorin of Calicut dispatches a service request to Cabral's idling fleet. Arab merchants allied with rival city-state of [[Cochin kingdom]] are returning from [[Ceylon]] with a cargo of [[war elephants]] destined for the Sultan of [[Cambay]] (Khambhat, Gujarat).  Claiming it to be illegal contraband (and the Zamorin could probably use the elephants himself), Cabral is asked if he can intercept them.  Cabral sends one of his caravels, brimming with cannon, under [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]] (nicknamed 'Inferno'), to capture it.  Hoping for a spectacle, the Zamorin himself comes down to the beachfront to witness the engagement, but leaves in disgust when the Arab ship deftly slips past Ataide.  But Ata\u00edde gives chase and eventually catches up with it near [[Kannur|Cannanore]] and successfully seizes the vessel.  Cabral presents the captured ship, with its nearly intact elephant cargo (one pachyderm was killed in the engagement), to the Zamorin as a gift.\n\n=== Calicut Massacre ===\n\nDecember 1500 \u2013 After two months of operation, factor Aires Correia has only been able to buy enough spices to load two of the ships. He complains to Cabral his suspicions that the [[guild]] of Arab merchants in Calicut have been [[collusion|colluding]] to shut out Portuguese purchasing agents from the city's spice markets which is not unlikely. Arab traders had reportedly used similar collusive tactics to drive out Chinese merchants earlier in the 15th century from various ports on the [[Malabar Coast]]. It would make sense if they tried doing so again\u2014particularly as the Portuguese had arrived trumpeting their hatred of 'the Moors' and demanding trading privileges and preferences, a clear danger to their own trade.\n\nHistorians cite murkier elements to this, in particular, that the Portuguese traders might have been unwitting counters in on-going quarrels between competing older and newer Arab merchant guilds in Calicut and or used as pawns in the personal power struggles among the Zamorin's leading advisors, etc. There were certainly more dimensions to this affair, the full details of which will likely never be clearly known.\n\nCabral presents the complaint to the Zamorin, and requests that he crack down on the Arab merchant guild or enforce Portuguese priority in the spice markets.  But the Zamorin refuses to intervene in the matter\u2014or rather makes only some vague promises, but disdains to get actively involved in the matter, as Cabral demands.\n\nDecember 17, 1500 \u2013 Frustrated by the Zamorin's inaction, Cabral decides to take matters into his own hands.  On the advice of Aires Correia, Cabral orders the seizure of an Arab merchant ship from [[Jeddah]], then loading up with spices in Calicut harbor, claiming that as the Zamorin had promised the Portuguese priority in the spice markets, the cargo is rightfully theirs.  Incensed, the Arab merchants around the quay immediately raise a riot in Calicut and direct mobs to attack the Portuguese factory.  The Portuguese ships, anchored out in the harbor and unable to approach the docks, helplessly watch the unfolding massacre.  After three hours of fighting, some 53 (some say 70) Portuguese are slaughtered by the mobs\u2014including the factor Aires Correia, the secretary [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]], and three (some say five) of the Franciscan friars.  Around twenty Portuguese then in the city manage to escape the riot by jumping into the harbor waters and swimming to the ships.  The survivors report to Cabral that the Zamorin's own [[Hindu]] guards were seen either standing aside or actively helping the rioters.\n\nAt least one Portuguese, a man called Gon\u00e7alo Peixoto, survived the massacre, sheltered from the mob by a local merchant (whom the chronicles call \"Coja Bequij\").  In the aftermath, the wares in the Portuguese factory are impounded by the Calicut authorities.\n\n=== War with Calicut ===\n\nDecember 18\u201322, 1500 \u2013 Incensed at the attack on the factory, Cabral waits one day for redress by the Zamorin.  When this is not forthcoming, Cabral takes his revenge. The Portuguese seize around ten Arab merchant ships then in harbor, confiscating their cargoes, killing their crews, and burning their ships.  Then, accusing the Zamorin of sanctioning the riot, Cabral orders a full day [[shore bombardment]] of Calicut, doing immense damage to the unfortified city (estimates of Calicut casualties reach up to 600). Cabral proceeds to also bomb the nearby Zamorin-owned port of Pandarane (Pantalayani Kollam, near present-day [[Koyilandy]]) as well.<ref>The port of ''Pandarane'' has since vanished.  Its location is usually identified as 'Pantalyini Kollam', a port that has since been annexed by the growing city of [[Koyilandy]]; it is also sometimes identified with modern [[Kappad]]. (Dames, 1918: p.85)</ref>\n\nThus opened the war between the Kingdom of Portugal and the Zamorin of Calicut.  The war will drag on for the next decade.  Future [[Portuguese India Armadas]] have to contend with this conflict, it will dictate Portuguese strategy in the Indian Ocean and draw in other participants.  The conflict will also overturn the political order on the [[Malabar Coast]] of India, and shape a different future for [[Kerala]].\n\n=== Alliance with Cochin kingdom ===\n\n[[File:Kerala cities at time of Cabral (1500).gif|thumb|250px|India [[Malabar Coast]] c. 1500]]\nDecember 24, 1500 \u2013 Cabral leaves smoldering Calicut, unsure of what to do next. At the suggestion of [[Gaspar da Gama]] (the Goese Jew who had been accompanying the expedition), Cabral sets sail south along the coast towards [[Cochin kingdom]] (''Cochim'', Kochi or Perumpadappu Swarupam), a small [[Hindu]] [[Nair]] city-state at the outlet of the [[brackish]] [[Vembanad Lake|Vembanad]] lagoon in the Kerala backwaters. Half-in-vassalage and half-at-war with Zamorin's Calicut, Cochin kingdom had long chafed at the dominance of its larger neighbor and was looking for an opportunity to break away.\n\nArriving in Cochin, a Portuguese emissary, accompanied by a [[Saint Thomas Christians|Christian]] picked up in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], are set ashore to make contact with the Trimumpara Raja (Unni Goda Varma), the [[Nair]] [[Hindu]] prince of [[Cochin kingdom]].<ref>The exact status of the 'Trimumpara Raja', the ruling prince of Cochin, is a bit unclear.  It seems the formal ruler of Cochin was the king of [[Edapalli]], across the lagoon on the mainland, that the Cochinese peninsula (with capital at [[Perumpadappu (Malappuram district)|Perumpadappu]]) had at some point been detached as an appanage for a son, who, in turn, had detached the northern tip, Cochin proper, for another son.  Moreover, it seems these appanages were not supposed to be permanent fiefs, but rather to serve as temporary 'training' grounds for princely heirs before they moved up in succession order.  In other words, the ruler of Cochin was the second heir of Edapalli.  Upon the death of the ruler of Edapalli, the first heir was supposed to leave the peninsula and take up his duties in Edapalli, and the second heir move from Cochin to Perumpadappu, and assign Cochin to his own successor (the new second heir). It seems the Portuguese arrived at a time when the princely heirs were somewhat at odds with each other\u2014possibly because of some violation in the rules of succession, or simply because the ruler of Cochin was tired of waiting for his turn. It is only  under Portuguese protection that the rulers of Cochin finally became proper kings in their own right.  Thus, the Raja Trimumpara's search for a Portuguese alliance have more to do with his own family quarrels than with the exactions of the Zamorin of Calicut.  See Dames (1918: p.86n).</ref> The Portuguese are greeted warmly\u2014the bombardment of hated Zamorin's Calicut outweighing the earlier matter of the war elephants.  All the cordialities and hostage-swapping quickly fulfilled, Cabral himself goes ashore and negotiates a treaty of alliance between Portugal and Cochin kingdom, directed against Zamorin's Calicut. Cabral promises to make the Trimumpara Raja of Cochin the ruler of kingdom of Calicut, upon the city's capture.\n\nA Portuguese factory is set up in Cochin, with Gon\u00e7alo Gil Barbosa as chief factor (the pre-designated Aires Correia having perished in the Calicut Massacre). A smaller, poorer city, the spice markets of Cochin are not nearly as well supplied as Calicut, but the trade is good enough to begin loading ships.  The stay in Cochin is not without incident\u2014the factory is set ablaze one evening (probably at the instigation of Arab traders in the city), but the Trimumpara Raja will not countenance a repeat of the events of Calicut.  He cracks down on the arsonists, takes the Portuguese under his protection (the factors stay in his palace), and assigns his personal [[Nair]] guards to escort the Portuguese factors in the city's markets and protect the factory against any further incidents.\n\nEarly January 1501 \u2013 While in Cochin, Cabral receives missives from the rulers of [[Kannur|Cannanore]] (''Canonor'', Kannur or Kolathunad, further north, another of Calicut's reluctant rivals) and [[Quilon]] (''Coul\u00e3o'', Kollam or Venad Swarupam, further south, once a great Syrian Christian merchant city-state, entrepot for cinnamon, ginger and dyewood).  They commend Cabral's actions against Zamorin's Calicut, and invite the Portuguese to trade in their cities instead. Not wishing to offend his gracious Cochinese host, Cabral politely declines the invitations, promising only to visit those cities at some future date.\n\nWhile still at Cochin, Cabral receives yet another invitation, this one from nearby [[Kodungallur Kovilakam|Cranganore kingdom]] (''Cranganor'', Kodungallur). Once a great city on the northern end of the Vembanad lagoon, capital of the [[Chera dynasty]] of [[Sangam period]], Cranganore had since fallen on hard times.  Mother nature delivered Cranganore two severe blows\u2014silting up the channels that connected Cranganore to the waterways, and breaking open a competing sea outlet by Cochin in the 14th century.<ref>Cochin was originally just a village along a long embankment.  Violent overflows of the [[Periyar River]] in 1341 forced the opening of the outlet between the Vembanad lagoon and the Arabian Sea at the juncture where Cochin now sits, separating the long Cochinese peninsula from what is now [[Vypin]] island. See Hunter's ''Imperial Gazetteer'' (1908: p.360).</ref> Cochin's rise had been principally due to the re-routing of commercial traffic away from Cranganore. Nonetheless, the remaining merchants of the dwindling city still maintained their old connections to the Kerala pepper plantations in the interior. Finding the supply in Cochin running low, Cabral takes up the offer to top up their cargo at Cranganore.\n\nThe visit to Cranganore turns out to be an eye-opener for the Portuguese, for among the city's remaining inhabitants are substantial established communities of [[Cochin Jews|Malabari Jews]] and [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani|Syrian Christians]].  The encounter with a clearly recognizable Christian community in Kerala confirms to Cabral what the Franciscan friars had already suspected back in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]]\u2014namely, that Vasco da Gama's earlier hypothesis about a 'Hindu Church' was mistaken. If real Christians have existed alongside Hindus in India for centuries, then clearly [[Hinduism]] must be a distinct and separate religion, 'heathen idolaters', as the Portuguese friars characterized them, rather than a 'primitive' form of Christianity.  Two Syrian Christian priests from Cranganore apply to Cabral for passage to Europe (one of them, known as Jos\u00e9 de Cranganore or Joseph the Indian (''Josephus Indus''), will provide instrumental intelligence about India to the Portuguese.<ref>Upon arrival in Lisbon, Joseph the Indian spent a couple of years being intensely interviewed by the Portuguese court and the [[Casa da \u00cdndia]], relating to them his detailed knowledge of the history and geography of India and points east, expanding Portuguese intelligence dramatically.  It is likely that the detailed depiction of the east Indian coast and the [[Bay of Bengal]] in the [[Cantino planisphere]] of 1502 is owed in large part to Joseph's information.  Around 1503, Joseph proceeded to Rome to meet [[Pope Alexander VI]] and report on the condition of the Malabari [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani|Syrian Christian]] church.  It was on this trip that Joseph dictated his famous narrative on India to an Italian scribe, which was eventually published in 1507 (in Italian) as part of a collection, ''Paesi Novamente Retrovati'', edited by Fracanzio da Montalboddo.  The narrative includes Joseph's own account of Cabral's expedition.  See Vallavanthara (2001).</ref>\n\nJanuary 16, 1501 \u2013 News arrives that the Zamorin of Calicut had assembled and dispatched a fleet of around 80 boats against the Portuguese in Cochin.  Despite the Trimumpara Raja of Cochin's offer of military assistance against the Calicut fleet, Cabral decides to precipitously lift anchor and slip away rather than risk a confrontation.  Cabral's armada leave behind the factor Gon\u00e7alo Gil Barbosa and six assistants in Cochin.  In their hasty departure, the Portuguese inadvertently take along two of the Trimumpara's officers (Idikkela Menon and Parangoda Mennon), who had been serving as noble hostages aboard the vessels.\n\nHeading north, Cabral's armada takes a wide sweep to avoid Calicut, and pays a quick visit to [[Kannur|Cannanore]].  Cabral is warmly received by the [[Kolathiri]] Raja of Cannanore who, eager for a Portuguese alliance, offers to sell the Portuguese spices on credit. Cabral accepts the cargo but pays him nonetheless (not a splendid cargo\u2014only low-quality ginger, as it turns out, but Cabral is appreciative of the gesture.)\n\nHis ships now filled with spices, Cabral decides not to visit [[Quilon]], as he had earlier promised, but to make way back home to Portugal.\n\n== Diogo Dias' misadventures ==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2020}}\nWhile Cabral's main fleet was in India, [[Diogo Dias]], captain of the missing seventh ship of the armada, was going through his own set of adventures.\n\n[[File:Detail of Diogo Dias's ship (Cabral Armada).jpg|thumb|180px|Ship of [[Diogo Dias]], detail from the ''Mem\u00f3ria das Armadas'']]\nShortly after being separated from the main fleet at the Cape in June 1500, Dias had struck out too far east into the Indian Ocean and sighted the western coast of the island of [[Madagascar]].  Although the island was not unknown (its Arab name, \"island of the Moon\", was already reported by [[Pero de Covilha|Covilh\u00e3]]), Diogo Dias was the first Portuguese captain to have sighted it and is often credited with renaming it the island of ''S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o'', on account of it being found on [[St. Lawrence]]'s day (August 10, 1500).  However, a proper landing on Madagascar would not be undertaken until 1506 and it would only be extensively explored in 1508.\n\nProbably thinking he was on a South African island, Diogo Dias tried to find the African coast by sailing straight north from Madagascar, hoping to reconnect with Cabral's armada there, or at least to make it to [[Sofala]] (Dias's formal destination).  But to no avail.  He had struck too far east, and was heading along north in open ocean.  Dias sighted the African coast only around [[Mogadishu]] (''Magadoxo''). By this time, Cabral had already crossed the Indian Ocean, and the change in the monsoon winds prevented Dias from undertaking his own crossing. Dias pushed up the coast, unexpectedly going past [[Cape Guardafui]] into the [[Gulf of Aden]], waters as yet unsailed by Portuguese ships.  Dias spent the next few months in the area\u2014trapped by contrary winds, battered by tempests, attacked by Arab pirates, and forced aground on the [[Eritrea]]n coast, in a desperate search for water and food.\n\nDias eventually (in late 1500 and early 1501) managed to procure supplies, repair his ship and catch a favorable wind to take him out of that harrowing trap.  With his remaining six crewmen, Dias set sail back to Portugal, hoping to catch Cabral's armada on the return journey.\n\n== Return journey ==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2020}}\nLate January, 1501 \u2013 Cabral takes aboard an ambassador from Cannanore, and starts his ocean crossing back to East Africa.  On the way, the Portuguese capture a  Gujarati ship, replete with a magnificent cargo.  They steal the cargo, but spare the crew, once they realize they are not Arabs.\n\nFebruary, 1501 \u2013 As Cabral's expedition approaches [[Malindi]], vice-admiral [[Sancho de Tovar]], sailing at the front, runs his spice-laden ship, the ''El Rei'', aground on the Malindi coast.  Irreparable, the great ship is burnt (to recover the iron fittings) and the crews and the cargo reallocated.  Cabral's armada is now reduced to five ships. Cabral authorizes the king of Malindi to recover the cannons from the ''El Rei'' wreck and keep them for himself.\n\nSpring, 1501 \u2013 Cabral's fleet reaches [[Mozambique Island]].  As there is no sign or news from [[Diogo Dias]] awaiting him, Cabral realizes he must take responsibility for the Sofala mission himself.  Cabral orders the private ship ''Anunciada'' of Nuno Leit\u00e3o da Cunha, the fastest in the fleet, to be placed under the command of veteran hand [[Nicolau Coelho]], and dispatched ahead of the rest of the fleet and deliver the results of the voyage to Portugal.  Vice-admiral [[Sancho de Tovar]] (who had lost the ''El-Rei'') is given the chance to make amends by taking command of the caravel ''S\u00e3o Pedro'' (hitherto commanded by [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]]) and seek out Sofala and to proceed home alone from there.  Ata\u00edde is transferred to the command of Coelho's old nau.\n\nIn the meantime, Cabral lands a ''[[degredado]]'' Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes on the African coast, with letters of instruction for Diogo Dias and any passing Portuguese expeditions, informing them of the dramatic turn of events in India, and warning them to avoid Calicut.\n\n[It is uncertain exactly where Cabral left Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes or where he was ordered to go.  According to Ata\u00edde, Fernandes was ordered to go to Mombassa (odd, as Mombassa was then on hostile terms with the Portuguese); others suggest he was supposed to go to Kilwa (which is where the 3rd Armada of [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]] will find him). Others have speculated that Fernandes was left in Kilwa on the outward leg, and that Cabral's letters were dispatched to him by a local messenger from Mozambique on the return.  Another possibility is that Fernandes was instructed to make his way to Sofala overland, meet Tovar's ship there, and then proceed to explore inland from there to locate [[Monomatapa]] (but then why give him the letters?).  Finally, some conjecture Fernandes is being confused with another degredado, Jo\u00e3o Machado, who had been left in Malindi on the first leg, that he was picked up on the return, and now sent back once again with the letters.]\n\nMarch\u2013April, 1501 \u2013 Matters settled, Cabral takes the remaining three ships\u2014his own flagship, the large nau of Sim\u00e3o de Miranda and Coelho's ship (now under [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]])\u2014and sets sail out of Mozambique island.\n\nAta\u00edde gets separated from the other two in the [[Mozambique Channel]] soon after departure. He hurries to S\u00e3o Br\u00e1s ([[Mossel Bay]], South Africa), hoping to find Cabral there waiting for him.  But he is out of luck\u2014Cabral and Miranda had decided to proceed on together towards Lisbon without him.  Not finding any trace of the others, Ata\u00edde decides to make his way home on his own, leaving behind a letter in a boot by a local watering hole giving an account of the expedition (Ataide's note will be found later that year by [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]]'s [[3rd Portuguese India Armada (Nova, 1501)|3rd Armada]]).\n\nIn the meantime, Sancho de Tovar, aboard the ''S\u00e3o Pedro'', finally sights [[Sofala]], the entrepot of Monomatapa gold.  He doesn't go ashore, and instead contents himself with scouting the city from his ship, and then sets sail back home alone.\n\n=== Conference at Bezeguiche ===\n\nJune 2, 1501 \u2013 Following up on the discovery of Brazil the previous year, King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] had assembled a small exploratory expedition of three caravels under an unnamed Portuguese captain, and carrying the [[Republic of Florence|Florentine]] cosmographer [[Amerigo Vespucci]] aboard, to explore and map the coast of Brazil.  The exact identity of the captain is uncertain - some speculate it to be [[Gaspar de Lemos]] or [[Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves (explorer)|Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves]], whichever of the two had commanded the supply vessel that had delivered the news in June 1500; others conjecture Lemos/Gon\u00e7alves went merely as passengers, and that the expedition itself was commanded by [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]].<ref>[[Amerigo Vespucci]] wrote two detailed accounts of this Brazilian mapping expedition - in ''Mundus Novus'' (pub. 1502/03) and as the \"third voyage\" in ''Lettera a Soderini'' (pub.1504/05) - but does not identify the Portuguese captain by name in either.  Chronicler [[Gaspar Correia]], writing a half-century later, identifies the mapping captain as the same captain who steered the returning supply ship - ergo the Lemos/Gon\u00e7alves identification.  Greenlee (1945) suggests the captain was [[Fern\u00e3o de Loronha]], although this has been dismissed by others (e.g. Roukema, 1963).  More recently, historians have drawn attention to a nautical chart by [[Vesconte de Maggiolo]], which identifies the Brazilian landmass with the label ''Tera de Gonsalvo Coigo Vocatur Santa Cruz'' (translated as \"Land of [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]] called Santa Cruz\").  [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]] is known to have led a later expedition to Brazil (which set out in 1503), but it is commonly estimated that Coelho was still out at sea when Maggiolo composed his chart (c. 1504-05), thereby suggesting Coelho might have also captained the previous 1501 mapping expedition as well. (Morison, 1974, vol. 2, p.281)</ref> Setting out from Lisbon in May 1501, the little Brazilian mapping expedition made a watering stop in early June at ''Bezeguiche'' (as the bay of [[Dakar]] (Senegal) was known to the Portuguese sailors of the time) and stumbles upon  [[Diogo Dias]] cooling his heels there. Dias relates to the Portuguese captain and Vespucci the tales of his misadventures\u2014how he had been separated from Cabral at the Cape, how he had ventured up to the Gulf of Aden, and, finding no trace of Cabral on his return, decided to wait for him in Bezeguiche. Just two days later, the lead ship of the returning India fleet\u2014the ''Anunciada'' under [[Nicolau Coelho]]\u2014sails into Bezeguiche, surprised to find both Dias and the Brazilian mapping expedition there (apparently  Bezeguiche must have been a pre-arranged point of encounter for the Second Armada).\n\nFor the next two weeks, the captains and crews of the different ships exchange tales of their travels and adventures.  It has been since speculated that it was during this time that Amerigo Vespucci came up with his \"[[New World]]\" hypothesis.  After all, Vespucci was quite familiar with the Americas, having participated in [[Alonso de Ojeda|Ojeda]]'s 1499 expedition to the coasts of South America, and it is said he had intense discussions at Bezeguiche with [[Gaspar da Gama]], the Goese Jew aboard Coelho's ship, undoubtedly the person most familiar with the East Indies. Comparing notes, it probably dawned on Vespucci that it was simply impossible to square what he knew of the Americas with what the men of the 2nd Armada knew of Asia.  While still at Bezeguiche, Vespucci wrote a letter to [[Lorenzo de' Medici (1463\u20131503)|Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]], relating his encounter, which he sends back with some Florentine passengers on the ''Anunciada''.<ref>Vespucci's 1501 letter is reproduced in Varnhagen (1865).   An English translation can be found in W.H.Greenlee (1938: p.152ff).</ref>  This was a prelude to an even more famous letter of Vespucci to Lorenzo in 1503, shortly after his return, where he finally asserts that the Brazilian landmass was in fact a continent, that the lands discovered to the west were definitely not part of Asia, but must be an entirely different continent, a \"[[New World]]\".<ref>Vespucci (1503). After leaving Bezeguiche, the mapping expedition would make landfall at [[Cape S\u00e3o Roque]] in August 1501, and proceeded to sail south along the Brazilian coast, possibly as far as the [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]] coast. They returned to Lisbon before September 1502, perhaps as early as June. A second mapping expedition, this time more certainly under [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]], also accompanied by Vespucci (his \"fourth voyage\"), set out for Brazil in April, 1503.</ref>\n\nMid-June, 1501 \u2013 Lemos & Vespucci leave Bezeguiche for Brazil. Shortly after, the pair [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] and Sim\u00e3o de Miranda themselves reach Bezeguiche, where they find Diogo Dias and Nicolau Coelho awaiting them. Cabral sends Coelho's swift ''Anunciada'' ahead to Lisbon to announce their return, while the remainder rest and wait in Bezeguiche for the remaining two ships.  [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]]'s ship (making his way alone from Mossel Bay) and [[Sancho de Tovar]]'s ''S\u00e3o Pedro'' (returning from Sofala) arrive in Bezeguiche by the end of June.\n\nJune 23, 1501 \u2013 The ''Anunciada'', commanded by [[Nicolau Coelho]], arrives in Lisbon and anchors in [[Bel\u00e9m]].  (Just as in case of Vasco da Gama's expedition, it turns out Nicolau Coelho is once again the first to deliver the news!)  The merchants of the consortium led by [[Bartolomeo Marchionni]] (who own the ''Anunciada'') are delighted.  Letters are immediately fired off throughout Europe announcing the results.\n\nThe news arrives too late for [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]]'s [[3rd Portuguese India Armada (Nova, 1501)|3rd India Armada]], which departed for India in April.  But Nova will collect the necessary information along the way\u2014from the note in Ata\u00edde's shoe in Mossel Bay, and from Cabral's letters in the possession of Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes in Kilwa.\n\nJuly 21, 1501 \u2013 One month after Coelho's arrival, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral and Sim\u00e3o de Miranda, the two larger ships, finally arrive in Lisbon. The other three ships arrive a few days later: Sancho de Tovar and P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde on July 25 and the hapless Diogo Dias, with his empty caravel, on July 27.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n{{Refimprove-section|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:Bernardelli - Monumento a Cabral.jpg|thumb|180px|Monument to [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] in Lisbon, copy of a Brazilian monument by Rodolpho Bernardelli]]\nOn the surface, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral's 2nd Armada had been a failure and the reaction was conspicuously muted.\n\nShip losses were very heavy. Of the thirteen ships sent out, only five returned with cargo (four crown, one private), five were lost at sea, three returned without cargo (Gaspar de Lemos, Lu\u00eds Pires and Diogo Dias).\n\nHuman losses were even more disheartening.  This included all the crews and captains of the four ships lost at the Cape (notably, the celebrated discoverer Bartolomeu Dias).  Another fifty-something Portuguese (including the factor Aires Correia) had been killed in the Calicut massacre.\n\nThen there were the mission failures.  Relative to the instructions given to him in Lisbon, Cabral had failed on nearly every count:\n*1. failed to establish a treaty with the Zamorin of Calicut\u2014indeed, Calicut was now more hostile than ever.\n*2. failed to establish a factory at Calicut (massacred);\n*3. failed to bring the 'Hindu Church' in line (the friars that survived reported the Hindus weren't Christians after all, just 'idolaters');\n*4. failed to make a treaty with Kilwa;\n*5. failed to establish a factory at Sofala (seen from afar by Tovar, but that is all).\n\nOn the other hand, in his defense, Cabral could point to some positive achievements.\n\n*1. opening of friendly relations with Cochin, Canannore and Quilon;\n*2. a factory in Cochin, poorer than Calicut perhaps, but workable;\n*3. discovery of true Christian communities in Cranganore, etc.;\n*4. Sofala was at least discovered and scouted;\n*5. discovery of Brazil, which might serve as a useful staging post for future India runs;\n*6. Diogo Dias's discovery of Madagascar and exploration of the African coast up to Cape Guardafui and the Gulf of Aden was useful information.\n*7. Finally, Cabral did bring back tons of spices, which were off-loaded into the Lisbon warehouses and sold at no small profit for the crown treasury.\n\nHowever, it was the ship and human losses that weighed heavily against Cabral being honored or rewarded. Allegations of 'incompetence' flew easily in the circles that mattered. Although Cabral was initially offered the command of the [[4th Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1502)|4th Armada]], scheduled for 1502, it seemed more like a ''pro forma'' gesture than a sincere offer.<ref>Subrahmanyam (1997: p.191)</ref> The crown made it clear that Cabral's command would be limited and supervised \u2013 conditions humiliating enough to force Cabral to withdraw his name.  The 4th Armada would be placed under the command of Vasco da Gama.\n\nAlthough the reaction of Portuguese court opinion in 1501, on Cabral's return, was generally low, it ascended retrospectively.  Cabral's discovery of Brazil, initially received as a minor discovery of little interest, turned out to be much more momentous.  The follow-up Brazilian mapping expeditions of 1501-02 and 1503-04, under the captaincy of [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]], carrying the Florentine cosmographer [[Amerigo Vespucci]], revealed a massive continent - which Vespucci famously labelled a \"[[New World]]\" (''Mundus Novus'').  The plentitude of [[brazilwood]] (''pau-brasil'') discovered by the mapping expeditions on its shores lured the interest of European cloth industry, and led to the 1505 contract granted to [[Fern\u00e3o de Loronha]] for the commercial exploitation of Brazil. The lucrative brazilwood trade eventually drew competition from French and Spanish interlopers, forcing the Portuguese government to take a more active interest in Cabral's \"[[Name of Brazil|Land of Vera Cruz]]\", finally leading to the establishment of the first Portuguese colonies in [[Colonial Brazil]] in 1532.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Carta de P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]]\n* [[Portuguese India Armadas]]\n* [[Portuguese India]]\n* [[Alternative theory of the European discovery of Brazil]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=note |30em}}\n\n== References == \n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n'''Eyewitness Accounts'''\n\n* [Anonymous Pilot] \"Navigationi del Capitano Pedro Alvares Cabral Scrita per un Piloto Portoghese et Tradotta di Lingua Portoghese in Italiana\", first published in Francanzano Montalbado, 1507, editor, ''Paesi novamente retrovati et Novo Mondo da Alberico Vesputio Florentino intitulato'', Vicenza.

Cabral's armada famously discovered [[Brazil]] for the Portuguese crown along the way. By and large, the 2nd Armada's diplomatic mission to [[India]] failed, and provoked the opening of hostilities between the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] and the feudal city-state of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], ruled by [[Zamorin]]s.  Nonetheless, it managed to establish a factory in the nearby [[Kingdom of Cochin]], the first Portuguese [[Factory (trading post)|factory]] in Asia.\n\n== Fleet ==\n\nThe [[1st Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1497)|first India Armada]], commanded by [[Vasco da Gama]], arrived in Portugal in the summer of 1499, in rather sorry shape. Half of his ships and men had been lost thanks to battles, disease, and storms. Although da Gama came back with a hefty cargo of spices that would be sold at enormous profit, he had failed in the principal objective of his mission: to negotiate a treaty with [[Zamorin]]'s [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], the spice entrep\u00f4t on the [[Malabar Coast]] of India. Da Gama managed, however, to open the [[Portuguese India Armadas|sea route to India]] via the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and secured good relations with the African city-state of [[Malindi]], a critical staging post along the way.\n\nOn the orders of King [[Manuel I of Portugal]], arrangements were immediately made to begin the assembly of a second armada in [[Cascais]].  Determined not to repeat da Gama's mistakes, this one was to be a large and well-armed fleet of 13 ships and 1500 men, laden with valuable gifts and diplomatic letters to win over the potentates of the east.\n\nMany details of the composition of the fleet are missing. Only three ship names are known, and there is some conflict among the sources on the captains.

Cabral had no notable naval or military experience; his appointment as ''capit\u00e3o-mor'' (captain-major) of the armada was largely a political one.  The exiled [[Crown of Castile|Castillian]] nobleman [[Sancho de Tovar]] was designated vice-admiral (''soto-capit\u00e3o'') and Cabral's successor should anything happen to him.<ref group=note>This is according to Castanheda and Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is. Gaspar Correia identifies Sim\u00e3o de Miranda as the predesignated successor instead.</ref>\n\nVeteran pilot [[Pedro Escobar]] was given the overall technical command of the expedition. Other veterans of the [[1st Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1497)|first (1497) armada]] include captain [[Nicolau Coelho]], pilot [[P\u00earo de Alenquer]], and clerks Afonso Lopes and [[Jo\u00e3o de S\u00e1]].  The famed navigator [[Bartolomeu Dias]], who was the first to double the Cape of Good Hope back in 1488, and his brother [[Diogo Dias]], who had served as clerk on da Gama's ship in the first expedition, also served as captains in the trip. \n\nMost of the ships were either [[carracks]] (''naus'') or [[caravels]], and at least one was a small supply ship, although details on names and tonnage are missing.<ref group=note>Castanheda (1551) claims there were ten carracks and three caravels. The Anonymous Pilot refers to only twelve ships, plus a supply ship.</ref>  At least two ships, Cabral's flagship and Tovar's ''El Rei'', were said to be around 240 tons, that is, about twice the size of the largest ship in the first armada three years prior.\n\nTen ships were destined for [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (Malabar, India), while the two ships headed by the Dias brothers were destined for [[Sofala]] in East Africa and the supply ship was destined to be scuttled and burnt along the way.<ref group=note>The Sofala destination of the Dias brothers is found in Castanheda (1551).  It is confirmed in the Anonymous Pilot.</ref>\n\n[[File:Cabral armada of 1500 (Livro das Armadas).jpg|thumb|250px|left|Fleet of the 2nd India Armada (Cabral, 1500), from the ''Mem\u00f3ria das Armadas'']]\n\nAt least two ships were privately owned and outfitted: Lu\u00eds Pires's ship was owned by Diogo da Silva e Meneses, [[Count of Portalegre]], while Nuno Leit\u00e3o da Cunha's ''Anunciada'' was owned by the king's cousin D. [[\u00c1lvaro of Braganza]], and financed by an Italian consortium composed of the Florentine bankers [[Bartolomeo Marchionni]] and [[Girolamo Sernigi]] and the Genoese Antonio Salvago. The remainder belonged to the [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese crown]].\n\nAccompanying the expedition as translator was [[Gaspar da Gama]], who was a Jew captured in Angediva by Vasco da Gama, as well as four Hindu hostages from Zamorin's kingdom taken by da Gama in 1498 during negotiations. Also aboard was the ambassador of the Sultan of Malindi, who had arrived at Portugal da Gama, and was set to return to Malindi with Cabral's expedition.\n\nOther passengers on the expedition included Aires Correia, designated [[Factor (agent)|factor]] for Calicut, his secretary [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]], Sofala factor Afonso Furtado, and clerk Martinho Neto.  Accompanying them on the trip was the royal physician and amateur astronomer, Master [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]], who brought along the latest [[astrolabe]] and new Arabic astronomical staves for navigational experiments.  One chronicler suggests that the knight [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] was also aboard.<ref group=note>[[Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is]] is the chronicler responsible for this claim.  This is not substantiated elsewhere.  Greenlee (1938, p. li) and Diffie and Winius (1977, p. 188fn) dismiss the possibility.</ref>\n\nThe fleet carried some twenty Portuguese ''[[degredado|degredados]]'', who were criminal convicts who could fulfill their sentences by being abandoned along the shores of various places and exploring inland on the crown's behalf. Four of the degredados are known: Afonso Ribeiro, Jo\u00e3o Machado, Luiz de Moura, and Antonio Fernandes, who was also a ship carpenter. \n\nFinally, the fleet carried eight [[Franciscan]] friars and eight chaplains, under the supervision of the head chaplain, Fr. Henrique Soares of Coimbra. They were the first Portuguese Christian missionaries to India.\n\nThere are three surviving eyewitness accounts of this expedition: (1) an extended letter written by [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]] (possibly dictated by Aires Correia), written from Brazil on May 1, 1500, to King Manuel I; (2) the brief letter by Mestre [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]] to the king, also from Brazil; and (3) the account of an anonymous Portuguese pilot, first published in Italian in 1507 (commonly referred to as the ''Rela\u00e7\u00e3o do Piloto An\u00f4nimo'', sometimes believed to be the clerk [[Jo\u00e3o de S\u00e1]]).\n\n== Mission ==\n\nCabral's instructions were several-fold. The priority was to secure a treaty with [[Zamorin]]'s [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (''Calecute'', Kozhikode), the principal commercial entrep\u00f4t of the [[Kerala]] spice trade and dominant feudal city-state on the [[Malabar coast]] of [[India]]. Calicut had been visited by [[Vasco da Gama]]'s first armada in 1498, but failed to impress the elderly ruling [[Zamorin|Manivikraman Raja Zamorin]] ('Samoothiri Raja') of Calicut, and no agreements had been signed. Cabral's instructions were precisely to succeed where Gama had failed, and to this end was entrusted with magnificent gifts to present to the Zamorin. Cabral was under orders to establish a ''feitoria'' ([[Factory (trading post)|factory]]) in Calicut, to be placed under Aires Correia, the designated [[Factor (agent)|factor]] for Calicut.\n\nThe second priority, assigned to the brothers [[Bartolomeu Dias]] and [[Diogo Dias]], was to search out the [[East Africa]]n port of [[Sofala]], near the mouth of the [[Zambezi]] river.<ref>Anonymous Pilot, p.107</ref>  Sofala had been secretly visited and described by the explorer [[P\u00earo da Covilh\u00e3]] during his overland expedition a decade earlier (c. 1487), and he identified it as the end-point of the [[Monomatapa]] gold trade.  The Portuguese crown was eager to tap into that gold source, but Gama's armada had failed to find it.  The Dias brothers were instructed to find and establish a factory at Sofala under designated factor Afonso Furtado.  To this end, instructions were probably also given to secure the consent of [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]] (''Qu\u00edloa''), the dominant city-state of the East African coast and putative overlord of Sofala (see [[Kilwa Sultanate]]).  Like Sofala, Kilwa had been visited by Covilh\u00e3, but overlooked by Gama.\n\nA minor objective included the delivery of a group of [[Franciscan]] missionaries to India. It is said that Vasco da Gama had misinterpreted the [[Hinduism]] he saw practiced in India as a form of 'primitive' Christianity.  He believed its peculiar characteristics were a result of centuries of separation from the mainstream church in Europe. Gama recommended that missionaries be sent to India to help bring the practices of the 'Hindu church' up to date with Roman Catholic orthodoxy.  To this end, a group of [[Franciscan]] friars, led by Fr. Henrique Soares of Coimbra, joined the expedition.\n\nFinally, the Second Armada was also a commercial spice run. The crown and private merchants who had outfitted the ships expected full cargoes of spices to return to Lisbon.\n\n=== Suspected Brazilian mission ===\n\nThere has been some controversial debate over whether [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] also had secret instructions from King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] to lay claim to the landmass of [[Brazil]]\u2014or more precisely, to swing as far west as possible to the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas line]], and claim whatever lands or islands might be discovered there for the Portuguese crown, before the Spanish did.<ref>e.g. Peres (1948). Among the pieces of 'evidence', is an indication of an island in the area in a 1448 map of [[Andrea Bianco]], apparently alluded to in the letter of Master Jo\u00e3o Faras; there is also the suggestion by [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]], in his ''Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis'' (c. 1505, Cap. 2), that he had been sent on an expedition to a western landmass in 1498.  That's about the full extent of the evidence of 'intentionality'.  See Greenlee (1938: pp.l-lv) for a critical assessment.</ref>    This claim is largely speculative.  There is no evidence of any such instructions, and various reasons to presume them unlikely.\n\nSpanish explorers had certainly been tending south lately. [[Christopher Columbus]] had touched the coast of the [[South America]]n mainland (around [[Guyana]]) in 1498, on his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus#Third voyage|third trip]]. In late 1499, [[Alonso de Ojeda]] had discovered much of the [[Venezuela]]n coast, with one of his squadrons, under [[Amerigo Vespucci]] exploring parts of what is now northern Brazil.  In early 1500, [[Vicente Y\u00e1\u00f1ez Pinz\u00f3n]] and [[Diego de Lepe]], via generous southerly swings from the [[Canary islands]], had reached at least what is now modern [[Cear\u00e1]], perhaps as far east as [[Cabo de Santo Agostinho|Cape of Santo Agostinho]] (in [[Pernambuco]]), and explored much of the northern Brazilian coast west of it.  It is possible that the southerly Spanish tendencies were deliberate, aimed at securing more land for the Spanish crown.<ref>Although the person the Spanish crown was trying to claim land away from was not the king of Portugal (that was already mediated by Tordesillas anyway), but from  Christopher Columbus, their own vice-roy of the Indies!  Ojeda, Pinz\u00f3n and Lepe were all dispatched on separate royal capitulations by [[Juan Rodr\u00edguez de Fonseca|Bishop Fonseca]], an enemy of Columbus, with the deliberate intent of finding and claiming lands ''outside'' (i.e. to the south) of the Columbus-owned West Indian islands, thereby circumscribing Columbus's viceroyalty, limiting him to the islands he already had.  This would figure in later lawsuits by the Columbus family.</ref>\n\nHowever, these Spanish expeditions were much too recent for their results to have been known in Lisbon before Cabral's departure in March 1500 (indeed, they were unknown in Spain itself\u2014at that moment, Ojeda was still in [[Hispaniola]], and Pinz\u00f3n and Lepe were still out at sea).  It is very doubtful that the Portuguese were aware of them.  And, even if they were, it would not seem sensible to deviate Cabral's large and heavy Second Armada, on an important mission to India, to pursue some open-ended exploratory work in unknown waters, that could have been far more efficiently accomplished by a couple of little caravels.\n\n== Outward journey ==\n\n[[File:Cabral armada of 1500 (Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu).jpg|thumb|350px|Fleet of the 2nd India Armada (Cabral, 1500), from the ''Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu'']]\nMarch 9, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's expedition, the 2nd India Armada of 13 ships, sets out from the Tagus.\n\nMarch 22, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's armada reaches [[Cape Verde]] island of [[S\u00e3o Nicolau, Cape Verde|S\u00e3o Nicolau]] in the middle of a storm.  The privately outfitted ship of Lu\u00eds Pires is too damaged by the tempest to continue, and returns to Lisbon<ref>According to Barros (1552, II.5.2 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Epo2AAAAMAAJ&dq=editions%3AUOM39015057112644&lr&as_brr=1&pg=PA386#v=onepage&q&f=false p.386]); also Castanheda (1551), G\u00f3is (1566).</ref> (Note: Caminha's letter (see below) makes no mention of Pires and instead reports that it was the crown ship of Vasco de Ataide was lost around Cape Verde.)\n\nFrom Cape Verde, Cabral strikes southwest.  The reasons for this unusual direction have been speculated upon endlessly. The most probable hypothesis is that Cabral was simply following the wide arc in the South Atlantic to catch a favorable wind to carry them to the Cape of Good Hope.\n\n[Navigationally, the arc is perfectly sensible: from Cape Verde, the ship cuts across the [[doldrums]] below the equator, catches the southwest-bound [[South Equatorial Current|equatorial drift]], turns into the southbound [[Brazil Current]] that will carry them down to the [[horse latitudes]] (30\u00b0S), where the prevailing [[westerlies]] begin.  The westerlies will then carry them quickly straight across the South Atlantic around the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. In almost all of this trajectory, the sailing ship is going with the current and usually upwind.  If instead of his arc, a ship attempts to strike southeast from Cape Verde, it will go into the [[Gulf of Guinea]], and from there to the Cape of Good Hope is a struggle\u2014it means sailing against the southeasterly [[trade wind]]s, and fighting against the [[Benguela Current]] to go south\u2014a much slower and more painful route, especially for square-rigged heavy ships which cannot [[tacking (sailing)|tack]] easily.]\n\nHow did Cabral know about this arc?  The most probable answer is that this was precisely the route followed by [[Vasco da Gama]] on his first trip in 1497. The veterans of the first fleet\u2014notably the pilots [[P\u00earo de Alenquer]] and [[Pedro Escobar]]\u2014would very likely have charted the same route for Cabral again.<ref>That this arc was sailed by Gama in 1497 is uncertain, but most modern historians have come to accept that he did.  How did Gama know about the arc when no one had yet sailed it before?  Some have speculated that the Portuguese crown might have dispatched secret exploratory expeditions to those waters in advance.  But, in the more widely accepted hypothesis, first forwarded by admiral [[Gago Coutinho]], it is more straightforward: since [[Bartolomeu Dias]]'s 1488 expedition discovered the [[westerlies]], the South Atlantic arc became 'navigationally obvious' to any sensible pilot, especially pilots as experienced as Alenquer and Escobar. See Gago Coutinho (1951\u201352) ''A Nautica dos Descobrimentos: os descobrimentos maritimos visitos por um navegador'', 2 vols., Lisbon: Agencia Geral do Ultramar.</ref>  Indeed, in the Lisbon archives, there is a draft of a document based on Gama and intended for Cabral that gives the essential instruction: to strike in a southwesterly direction when he reaches the doldrums.<ref>After Cape Verde, where the wind is weak ('vento escasso') the ships should strike in the open ocean arc ('ir na volta do mar'), until the Cape of Good Hope, as this is the shorter route ('a navega\u00e7\u00e3o ser\u00e1 mais breve').  See Fonseca (1908: p.211; see also p.224) [https://books.google.com/books?id=A7lI4gqh7PsC&pg=PA208#v=onepage&q&f=false copy of letter]; see also Greenlee (1938: p.167)</ref>  The difference is that this time the arc was a little wider, Cabral went further west than Gama had, and as a result hit upon the hitherto unknown landmass of [[Brazil]].\n\nAlternative hypotheses forwarded for Cabral striking southwest have been (1.) that Cabral was trying to reach the [[Azores]] to repair his storm-battered fleet; (2.) that he was searching for and rounding up missing tempest-tossed ships; (3.) the hypothesis, already considered above, that it was an intentional attempt to discover if there was any land by the Tordesillas line.\n\n=== Discovery of Brazil ===\n{{Cleanup-tense|date=July 2012}}\nApril 21, 1500 \u2013 After nearly 30 days of sailing (44 since departure), on April 21 (a Tuesday in the [[octave of Easter]]),<ref>Fonseca (1908: p.225)</ref> Cabral's fleet finds the first indications of nearby land.\n\nApril 22, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's armada sights the Brazilian coast, seeing the outlines of a hill they name [[Monte Pascoal]] (some 60&nbsp;km south of modern [[Porto Seguro]], [[Bahia]]).\n\nApril 23, 1500 \u2013 The armada anchors at the mouth of the [[Do Frade River|Frade river]] and a group of local [[Tupiniquim]] Indians assembles on the beach. Cabral dispatches a small party, headed by [[Nicolau Coelho]], in a longboat ashore to make first contact.  Coelho tosses his hat in exchange for a feathered headdress, but the surf is too strong for a proper landing and opening of communication, and so they return to the ships.<ref>Fonseca (1908: p.241-42)</ref>\n\nApril 23\u201324, 1500 \u2013 Strong overnight winds on prompt the armada to lift anchor and sail some 10 leagues (45&nbsp;km) north, finding harbor behind the reef at Cabr\u00e1lia Bay, just north of [[Porto Seguro]].  The pilot Afonso Lopes goes [[Sounding line|sounding]] in a rowboat. He spies a native canoe, captures the two Indians on board, and brings them back to ship.  The language barrier prevents questioning, but they are fed and given cloth and beads. The cultural differences were staggering, fed with honey and cake, they spit them out and were deeply surprised with the sight of a chicken.<ref>Guia politicamente incorreto da Hist\u00f3ria do Brasil, Leandro Narloch</ref>\n\nApril 25, 1500 \u2013 The next day a party led by [[Nicolau Coelho]] and [[Bartolomeu Dias]] goes ashore, accompanied by the two natives.  Armed Tupiniquim warily approach the beach, but on a signal from the two natives, lay down their bows, and allow the Portuguese to land and collect water.\n\n[[File:Meirelles-primeiramissa2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The First Mass in Brazil'' by [[Victor Meirelles]] (1861).]]\nApril 26, 1500 \u2013 (Octave of Easter Sunday) Franciscan friar Henrique Soares of Coimbra goes ashore to celebrate mass, curiously watched by some 200 Tupiniquim Indians.  It is the first known Christian mass on the American mainland.\n\nFor much of the week, interaction between the Portuguese and the Tupiniquim gradually increases.  There is a brisk trade in European iron nails, cloth, beads and crucifixes in return for American amulets, spears, parrots and monkeys. There is only the slightest hint that precious metals might be found in the hinterlands. Portuguese ''[[degredado]]s'' are assigned to spend the night in Tupiniquim villages, while the remainder of the crews sleep aboard ships.\n\n[[File:Carta-caminha.png|thumb|150px|Facsimile of the letter of [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]] to  King [[Manuel I of Portugal]], reporting the discovery of the 'Island of the True Cross\" (Brazil)]]\nMay 1, 1500 \u2013 Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral makes preparations to resume the journey to India.

The fleet faces headlong winds for six straight days. Four ships are lost at sea in the process\u2014most tragically, the Sofala-destined ship of [[Bartolomeu Dias]].  The famous navigator, the first to round the Cape back in 1488, fatally fails to round it this time. The three others are the crown-owned ships of Aires Gomes da Silva, Sim\u00e3o de Pina and Vasco de Ata\u00edde <ref>Castanheda (1551), Barros (1552) and G\u00f3is (1566) all identify the same four (B. Dias, A. Gomes da Silva, S. da Pina, V. d' Ata\u00edde) as lost at the Cape.  The ''Rela\u00e7ao das Naos'' mistakenly substitutes Sim\u00e3o de Miranda for Sim\u00e3o da Pina in the losses, although this is corrected in the marginal gloss. Gaspar Correia (1550) almost concurs\u2014but as he does not have Aires Gomes da Silva on his original captain list, he identifies the fourth ship lost as Gaspar de Lemos.   Analogously, the ''Livro de Lisuarte d'Abreu'' (1563), which doesn't have Pina nor Gomes da Silva on its list, say it was Diogo de Figueir\u00f3 and Luis Pires who were lost (in addition to Vasco d'Ata\u00edde and Bartolomeu Dias).  Diogo do Couto (c.1600) mistakenly adds P\u00earo d'Ataide to the list, bringing the losses to five.</ref> (if Ata\u00edde had not been lost earlier at Cape Verde, he is certainly lost now; some scholars contend Pires was lost now, and Ata\u00edde was lost earlier).  In any case, the fleet is reduced to seven ships.  Facing strong winds, the seven split into smaller groups, to meet again on the other side.  Cabral holds two ships together with his own.\n\nJune 16, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's battered three-ship squadron reaches the [[Primeiras and Segundas Archipelago|Primeiras Islands]] (several leagues north of Sofala).  Two local merchant ships, catching sight of Cabral, take flight.  Cabral gives pursuit\u2014one of them runs aground and the other is captured.  Questioning quickly determines that these ships are owned by a cousin of the sultan Fateima of [[Malindi]] (who had received Vasco da Gama so graciously back in 1498), so they are released without harm.\n\nJune 22, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's three-ship squadron hobble on to [[Mozambique Island]].  Despite the earlier quarrel with Gama, Cabral is given an unexpectedly warm reception by the Sultan of Mozambique, and allowed to collect water and supplies.  Shortly after, three more ships of the 2nd Armada sail into Mozambique island and make junction with Cabral.  Only the ship of [[Diogo Dias]] (Bartolomeu's brother) remains missing.  As Dias's mission was for Sofala anyway, Cabral decides not to wait for it but rather to press on with his current fleet of six ships.\n\n[[File:Map of Cabral route, 1500.gif|thumb|340px|Approximate route of outward journey of Cabral's 2nd Armada (also route of stray ship of Diogo Dias)]]\nJuly 26, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's armada reaches the city-state of [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]] (''Qu\u00edloa''), the dominant city of the East African coast (which Gama had never visited).  Afonso Furtado, who had been appointed factor for Sofala back in Lisbon and mercifully escaped death (Furtado had been aboard Bartolomeu Dias's ship, but moved to the flagship just before the Cape crossing), goes ashore to open negotiations with the strongman ruler, Emir Ibrahim  [Note: There is no current ruling [[Kilwa Sultanate|Sultan of Kilwa]]\u2014the last one, al-Fudail, was deposed in a coup (c. 1495) by his minister, Emir Ibrahim, who had since ruled Kilwa with a vacant throne.]\n\nA meeting is arranged between Cabral and Emir Ibrahim, conducted on a couple of rowboats in Kilwa harbor.  Cabral presents a letter from King Manuel I proposing a treaty, but Emir Ibrahim is suspicious and, for all the formal pleasantries, resistant to the overtures.  Cabral, feeling there's nothing to be achieved here and worried about missing the [[monsoon]] winds to India, decides to break off the negotiations and sail on.\n\nAugust 2, 1500, Pressing north, the Cabral fleet avoid hostile [[Mombassa]] (''Momba\u00e7a'') and finally reach friendly [[Malindi]] (''Melinde'').  There he drops off the Malindi ambassador that Gama had taken the previous year.  The Sultan of Malindi gives Cabral an excellent reception. Leaving behind  two ''degredados'' (Lu\u00eds de Moura and Jo\u00e3o Machado) and picking up two Gujarati pilots, Cabral's six-ship armada finally begins its Indian Ocean crossing on August 7.\n\n== Cabral in India ==\n{{Refimprove-section|date=April 2020}}\nAugust 22, 1500 \u2013 After an uneventful ocean crossing, Cabral's six ships land in [[Anjediva Island]] (''Angediva'', Anjadip), where they rest and recuperate, repair and repaint the ships.\n\nSeptember 13, 1500 \u2013 Sailing down the Indian coast, Cabral's expedition finally reaches at [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (''Calecute'', Kozhikode, the capital of the [[Nair]] [[Hindu]] kingdom of same name ruled by Zamorins, or Nediyuiruppu Swarupam). Gaily decorated native boats come out to greet them, but remembering Gama's experience, Cabral refuses to go ashore until hostages are exchanged.  He dispatches Afonso Furtado and the four Calicut hostages taken by da Gama the previous year, to negotiate the details of the landing. This eventually done, Cabral finally goes ashore himself and meets new [[Zamorin]] of Calicut (the wary old Zamorin that da Gama had met, had recently died). The Portuguese are better-prepared this time\u2014Cabral presents the young Zamorin with much finer and more luxurious gifts than Gama had brought, and more respectful and personalized letters of address from King [[Manuel I of Portugal]].\n\nA commercial treaty is successfully negotiated, and the Zamorin gives Cabral a security-of-trade certificate etched on a silver plate. The Portuguese are allowed to establish a ''[[Factory (trading post)|feitoria]]'' in Calicut and Aires Correia, the designated factor for Calicut, goes ashore with some 70 men. Once the factory is set up, Cabral releases the ship hostages as a sign of trust. Correia immediately sets about buying spices in Calicut's markets for the ships to take home.\n\nOctober (?), 1500 \u2013 Not long after, the Zamorin of Calicut dispatches a service request to Cabral's idling fleet. Arab merchants allied with rival city-state of [[Cochin kingdom]] are returning from [[Ceylon]] with a cargo of [[war elephants]] destined for the Sultan of [[Cambay]] (Khambhat, Gujarat).  Claiming it to be illegal contraband (and the Zamorin could probably use the elephants himself), Cabral is asked if he can intercept them.  Cabral sends one of his caravels, brimming with cannon, under [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]] (nicknamed 'Inferno'), to capture it.  Hoping for a spectacle, the Zamorin himself comes down to the beachfront to witness the engagement, but leaves in disgust when the Arab ship deftly slips past Ataide.  But Ata\u00edde gives chase and eventually catches up with it near [[Kannur|Cannanore]] and successfully seizes the vessel.  Cabral presents the captured ship, with its nearly intact elephant cargo (one pachyderm was killed in the engagement), to the Zamorin as a gift.\n\n=== Calicut Massacre ===\n\nDecember 1500 \u2013 After two months of operation, factor Aires Correia has only been able to buy enough spices to load two of the ships. He complains to Cabral his suspicions that the [[guild]] of Arab merchants in Calicut have been [[collusion|colluding]] to shut out Portuguese purchasing agents from the city's spice markets which is not unlikely. Arab traders had reportedly used similar collusive tactics to drive out Chinese merchants earlier in the 15th century from various ports on the [[Malabar Coast]]. It would make sense if they tried doing so again\u2014particularly as the Portuguese had arrived trumpeting their hatred of 'the Moors' and demanding trading privileges and preferences, a clear danger to their own trade.\n\nHistorians cite murkier elements to this, in particular, that the Portuguese traders might have been unwitting counters in on-going quarrels between competing older and newer Arab merchant guilds in Calicut and or used as pawns in the personal power struggles among the Zamorin's leading advisors, etc. There were certainly more dimensions to this affair, the full details of which will likely never be clearly known.\n\nCabral presents the complaint to the Zamorin, and requests that he crack down on the Arab merchant guild or enforce Portuguese priority in the spice markets.  But the Zamorin refuses to intervene in the matter\u2014or rather makes only some vague promises, but disdains to get actively involved in the matter, as Cabral demands.\n\nDecember 17, 1500 \u2013 Frustrated by the Zamorin's inaction, Cabral decides to take matters into his own hands.  On the advice of Aires Correia, Cabral orders the seizure of an Arab merchant ship from [[Jeddah]], then loading up with spices in Calicut harbor, claiming that as the Zamorin had promised the Portuguese priority in the spice markets, the cargo is rightfully theirs.  Incensed, the Arab merchants around the quay immediately raise a riot in Calicut and direct mobs to attack the Portuguese factory.  The Portuguese ships, anchored out in the harbor and unable to approach the docks, helplessly watch the unfolding massacre.  After three hours of fighting, some 53 (some say 70) Portuguese are slaughtered by the mobs\u2014including the factor Aires Correia, the secretary [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]], and three (some say five) of the Franciscan friars.  Around twenty Portuguese then in the city manage to escape the riot by jumping into the harbor waters and swimming to the ships.  The survivors report to Cabral that the Zamorin's own [[Hindu]] guards were seen either standing aside or actively helping the rioters.\n\nAt least one Portuguese, a man called Gon\u00e7alo Peixoto, survived the massacre, sheltered from the mob by a local merchant (whom the chronicles call \"Coja Bequij\").  In the aftermath, the wares in the Portuguese factory are impounded by the Calicut authorities.\n\n=== War with Calicut ===\n\nDecember 18\u201322, 1500 \u2013 Incensed at the attack on the factory, Cabral waits one day for redress by the Zamorin.  When this is not forthcoming, Cabral takes his revenge. The Portuguese seize around ten Arab merchant ships then in harbor, confiscating their cargoes, killing their crews, and burning their ships.  Then, accusing the Zamorin of sanctioning the riot, Cabral orders a full day [[shore bombardment]] of Calicut, doing immense damage to the unfortified city (estimates of Calicut casualties reach up to 600). Cabral proceeds to also bomb the nearby Zamorin-owned port of Pandarane (Pantalayani Kollam, near present-day [[Koyilandy]]) as well.<ref>The port of ''Pandarane'' has since vanished.  Its location is usually identified as 'Pantalyini Kollam', a port that has since been annexed by the growing city of [[Koyilandy]]; it is also sometimes identified with modern [[Kappad]]. (Dames, 1918: p.85)</ref>\n\nThus opened the war between the Kingdom of Portugal and the Zamorin of Calicut.  The war will drag on for the next decade.  Future [[Portuguese India Armadas]] have to contend with this conflict, it will dictate Portuguese strategy in the Indian Ocean and draw in other participants.  The conflict will also overturn the political order on the [[Malabar Coast]] of India, and shape a different future for [[Kerala]].\n\n=== Alliance with Cochin kingdom ===\n\n[[File:Kerala cities at time of Cabral (1500).gif|thumb|250px|India [[Malabar Coast]] c. 1500]]\nDecember 24, 1500 \u2013 Cabral leaves smoldering Calicut, unsure of what to do next. At the suggestion of [[Gaspar da Gama]] (the Goese Jew who had been accompanying the expedition), Cabral sets sail south along the coast towards [[Cochin kingdom]] (''Cochim'', Kochi or Perumpadappu Swarupam), a small [[Hindu]] [[Nair]] city-state at the outlet of the [[brackish]] [[Vembanad Lake|Vembanad]] lagoon in the Kerala backwaters. Half-in-vassalage and half-at-war with Zamorin's Calicut, Cochin kingdom had long chafed at the dominance of its larger neighbor and was looking for an opportunity to break away.\n\nArriving in Cochin, a Portuguese emissary, accompanied by a [[Saint Thomas Christians|Christian]] picked up in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], are set ashore to make contact with the Trimumpara Raja (Unni Goda Varma), the [[Nair]] [[Hindu]] prince of [[Cochin kingdom]].<ref>The exact status of the 'Trimumpara Raja', the ruling prince of Cochin, is a bit unclear.  It seems the formal ruler of Cochin was the king of [[Edapalli]], across the lagoon on the mainland, that the Cochinese peninsula (with capital at [[Perumpadappu (Malappuram district)|Perumpadappu]]) had at some point been detached as an appanage for a son, who, in turn, had detached the northern tip, Cochin proper, for another son.  Moreover, it seems these appanages were not supposed to be permanent fiefs, but rather to serve as temporary 'training' grounds for princely heirs before they moved up in succession order.  In other words, the ruler of Cochin was the second heir of Edapalli.  Upon the death of the ruler of Edapalli, the first heir was supposed to leave the peninsula and take up his duties in Edapalli, and the second heir move from Cochin to Perumpadappu, and assign Cochin to his own successor (the new second heir). It seems the Portuguese arrived at a time when the princely heirs were somewhat at odds with each other\u2014possibly because of some violation in the rules of succession, or simply because the ruler of Cochin was tired of waiting for his turn. It is only  under Portuguese protection that the rulers of Cochin finally became proper kings in their own right.  Thus, the Raja Trimumpara's search for a Portuguese alliance have more to do with his own family quarrels than with the exactions of the Zamorin of Calicut.  See Dames (1918: p.86n).</ref> The Portuguese are greeted warmly\u2014the bombardment of hated Zamorin's Calicut outweighing the earlier matter of the war elephants.  All the cordialities and hostage-swapping quickly fulfilled, Cabral himself goes ashore and negotiates a treaty of alliance between Portugal and Cochin kingdom, directed against Zamorin's Calicut. Cabral promises to make the Trimumpara Raja of Cochin the ruler of kingdom of Calicut, upon the city's capture.\n\nA Portuguese factory is set up in Cochin, with Gon\u00e7alo Gil Barbosa as chief factor (the pre-designated Aires Correia having perished in the Calicut Massacre). A smaller, poorer city, the spice markets of Cochin are not nearly as well supplied as Calicut, but the trade is good enough to begin loading ships.  The stay in Cochin is not without incident\u2014the factory is set ablaze one evening (probably at the instigation of Arab traders in the city), but the Trimumpara Raja will not countenance a repeat of the events of Calicut.  He cracks down on the arsonists, takes the Portuguese under his protection (the factors stay in his palace), and assigns his personal [[Nair]] guards to escort the Portuguese factors in the city's markets and protect the factory against any further incidents.\n\nEarly January 1501 \u2013 While in Cochin, Cabral receives missives from the rulers of [[Kannur|Cannanore]] (''Canonor'', Kannur or Kolathunad, further north, another of Calicut's reluctant rivals) and [[Quilon]] (''Coul\u00e3o'', Kollam or Venad Swarupam, further south, once a great Syrian Christian merchant city-state, entrepot for cinnamon, ginger and dyewood).  They commend Cabral's actions against Zamorin's Calicut, and invite the Portuguese to trade in their cities instead. Not wishing to offend his gracious Cochinese host, Cabral politely declines the invitations, promising only to visit those cities at some future date.\n\nWhile still at Cochin, Cabral receives yet another invitation, this one from nearby [[Kodungallur Kovilakam|Cranganore kingdom]] (''Cranganor'', Kodungallur). Once a great city on the northern end of the Vembanad lagoon, capital of the [[Chera dynasty]] of [[Sangam period]], Cranganore had since fallen on hard times.  Mother nature delivered Cranganore two severe blows\u2014silting up the channels that connected Cranganore to the waterways, and breaking open a competing sea outlet by Cochin in the 14th century.<ref>Cochin was originally just a village along a long embankment.  Violent overflows of the [[Periyar River]] in 1341 forced the opening of the outlet between the Vembanad lagoon and the Arabian Sea at the juncture where Cochin now sits, separating the long Cochinese peninsula from what is now [[Vypin]] island. See Hunter's ''Imperial Gazetteer'' (1908: p.360).</ref> Cochin's rise had been principally due to the re-routing of commercial traffic away from Cranganore. Nonetheless, the remaining merchants of the dwindling city still maintained their old connections to the Kerala pepper plantations in the interior. Finding the supply in Cochin running low, Cabral takes up the offer to top up their cargo at Cranganore.\n\nThe visit to Cranganore turns out to be an eye-opener for the Portuguese, for among the city's remaining inhabitants are substantial established communities of [[Cochin Jews|Malabari Jews]] and [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani|Syrian Christians]].  The encounter with a clearly recognizable Christian community in Kerala confirms to Cabral what the Franciscan friars had already suspected back in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]]\u2014namely, that Vasco da Gama's earlier hypothesis about a 'Hindu Church' was mistaken. If real Christians have existed alongside Hindus in India for centuries, then clearly [[Hinduism]] must be a distinct and separate religion, 'heathen idolaters', as the Portuguese friars characterized them, rather than a 'primitive' form of Christianity.  Two Syrian Christian priests from Cranganore apply to Cabral for passage to Europe (one of them, known as Jos\u00e9 de Cranganore or Joseph the Indian (''Josephus Indus''), will provide instrumental intelligence about India to the Portuguese.<ref>Upon arrival in Lisbon, Joseph the Indian spent a couple of years being intensely interviewed by the Portuguese court and the [[Casa da \u00cdndia]], relating to them his detailed knowledge of the history and geography of India and points east, expanding Portuguese intelligence dramatically.  It is likely that the detailed depiction of the east Indian coast and the [[Bay of Bengal]] in the [[Cantino planisphere]] of 1502 is owed in large part to Joseph's information.  Around 1503, Joseph proceeded to Rome to meet [[Pope Alexander VI]] and report on the condition of the Malabari [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani|Syrian Christian]] church.  It was on this trip that Joseph dictated his famous narrative on India to an Italian scribe, which was eventually published in 1507 (in Italian) as part of a collection, ''Paesi Novamente Retrovati'', edited by Fracanzio da Montalboddo.  The narrative includes Joseph's own account of Cabral's expedition.  See Vallavanthara (2001).</ref>\n\nJanuary 16, 1501 \u2013 News arrives that the Zamorin of Calicut had assembled and dispatched a fleet of around 80 boats against the Portuguese in Cochin.  Despite the Trimumpara Raja of Cochin's offer of military assistance against the Calicut fleet, Cabral decides to precipitously lift anchor and slip away rather than risk a confrontation.  Cabral's armada leave behind the factor Gon\u00e7alo Gil Barbosa and six assistants in Cochin.  In their hasty departure, the Portuguese inadvertently take along two of the Trimumpara's officers (Idikkela Menon and Parangoda Mennon), who had been serving as noble hostages aboard the vessels.\n\nHeading north, Cabral's armada takes a wide sweep to avoid Calicut, and pays a quick visit to [[Kannur|Cannanore]].  Cabral is warmly received by the [[Kolathiri]] Raja of Cannanore who, eager for a Portuguese alliance, offers to sell the Portuguese spices on credit. Cabral accepts the cargo but pays him nonetheless (not a splendid cargo\u2014only low-quality ginger, as it turns out, but Cabral is appreciative of the gesture.)\n\nHis ships now filled with spices, Cabral decides not to visit [[Quilon]], as he had earlier promised, but to make way back home to Portugal.\n\n== Diogo Dias' misadventures ==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2020}}\nWhile Cabral's main fleet was in India, [[Diogo Dias]], captain of the missing seventh ship of the armada, was going through his own set of adventures.\n\n[[File:Detail of Diogo Dias's ship (Cabral Armada).jpg|thumb|180px|Ship of [[Diogo Dias]], detail from the ''Mem\u00f3ria das Armadas'']]\nShortly after being separated from the main fleet at the Cape in June 1500, Dias had struck out too far east into the Indian Ocean and sighted the western coast of the island of [[Madagascar]].  Although the island was not unknown (its Arab name, \"island of the Moon\", was already reported by [[Pero de Covilha|Covilh\u00e3]]), Diogo Dias was the first Portuguese captain to have sighted it and is often credited with renaming it the island of ''S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o'', on account of it being found on [[St. Lawrence]]'s day (August 10, 1500).  However, a proper landing on Madagascar would not be undertaken until 1506 and it would only be extensively explored in 1508.\n\nProbably thinking he was on a South African island, Diogo Dias tried to find the African coast by sailing straight north from Madagascar, hoping to reconnect with Cabral's armada there, or at least to make it to [[Sofala]] (Dias's formal destination).  But to no avail.  He had struck too far east, and was heading along north in open ocean.  Dias sighted the African coast only around [[Mogadishu]] (''Magadoxo''). By this time, Cabral had already crossed the Indian Ocean, and the change in the monsoon winds prevented Dias from undertaking his own crossing. Dias pushed up the coast, unexpectedly going past [[Cape Guardafui]] into the [[Gulf of Aden]], waters as yet unsailed by Portuguese ships.  Dias spent the next few months in the area\u2014trapped by contrary winds, battered by tempests, attacked by Arab pirates, and forced aground on the [[Eritrea]]n coast, in a desperate search for water and food.\n\nDias eventually (in late 1500 and early 1501) managed to procure supplies, repair his ship and catch a favorable wind to take him out of that harrowing trap.  With his remaining six crewmen, Dias set sail back to Portugal, hoping to catch Cabral's armada on the return journey.\n\n== Return journey ==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2020}}\nLate January, 1501 \u2013 Cabral takes aboard an ambassador from Cannanore, and starts his ocean crossing back to East Africa.  On the way, the Portuguese capture a  Gujarati ship, replete with a magnificent cargo.  They steal the cargo, but spare the crew, once they realize they are not Arabs.\n\nFebruary, 1501 \u2013 As Cabral's expedition approaches [[Malindi]], vice-admiral [[Sancho de Tovar]], sailing at the front, runs his spice-laden ship, the ''El Rei'', aground on the Malindi coast.  Irreparable, the great ship is burnt (to recover the iron fittings) and the crews and the cargo reallocated.  Cabral's armada is now reduced to five ships. Cabral authorizes the king of Malindi to recover the cannons from the ''El Rei'' wreck and keep them for himself.\n\nSpring, 1501 \u2013 Cabral's fleet reaches [[Mozambique Island]].  As there is no sign or news from [[Diogo Dias]] awaiting him, Cabral realizes he must take responsibility for the Sofala mission himself.  Cabral orders the private ship ''Anunciada'' of Nuno Leit\u00e3o da Cunha, the fastest in the fleet, to be placed under the command of veteran hand [[Nicolau Coelho]], and dispatched ahead of the rest of the fleet and deliver the results of the voyage to Portugal.  Vice-admiral [[Sancho de Tovar]] (who had lost the ''El-Rei'') is given the chance to make amends by taking command of the caravel ''S\u00e3o Pedro'' (hitherto commanded by [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]]) and seek out Sofala and to proceed home alone from there.  Ata\u00edde is transferred to the command of Coelho's old nau.\n\nIn the meantime, Cabral lands a ''[[degredado]]'' Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes on the African coast, with letters of instruction for Diogo Dias and any passing Portuguese expeditions, informing them of the dramatic turn of events in India, and warning them to avoid Calicut.\n\n[It is uncertain exactly where Cabral left Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes or where he was ordered to go.  According to Ata\u00edde, Fernandes was ordered to go to Mombassa (odd, as Mombassa was then on hostile terms with the Portuguese); others suggest he was supposed to go to Kilwa (which is where the 3rd Armada of [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]] will find him). Others have speculated that Fernandes was left in Kilwa on the outward leg, and that Cabral's letters were dispatched to him by a local messenger from Mozambique on the return.  Another possibility is that Fernandes was instructed to make his way to Sofala overland, meet Tovar's ship there, and then proceed to explore inland from there to locate [[Monomatapa]] (but then why give him the letters?).  Finally, some conjecture Fernandes is being confused with another degredado, Jo\u00e3o Machado, who had been left in Malindi on the first leg, that he was picked up on the return, and now sent back once again with the letters.]\n\nMarch\u2013April, 1501 \u2013 Matters settled, Cabral takes the remaining three ships\u2014his own flagship, the large nau of Sim\u00e3o de Miranda and Coelho's ship (now under [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]])\u2014and sets sail out of Mozambique island.\n\nAta\u00edde gets separated from the other two in the [[Mozambique Channel]] soon after departure. He hurries to S\u00e3o Br\u00e1s ([[Mossel Bay]], South Africa), hoping to find Cabral there waiting for him.  But he is out of luck\u2014Cabral and Miranda had decided to proceed on together towards Lisbon without him.  Not finding any trace of the others, Ata\u00edde decides to make his way home on his own, leaving behind a letter in a boot by a local watering hole giving an account of the expedition (Ataide's note will be found later that year by [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]]'s [[3rd Portuguese India Armada (Nova, 1501)|3rd Armada]]).\n\nIn the meantime, Sancho de Tovar, aboard the ''S\u00e3o Pedro'', finally sights [[Sofala]], the entrepot of Monomatapa gold.  He doesn't go ashore, and instead contents himself with scouting the city from his ship, and then sets sail back home alone.\n\n=== Conference at Bezeguiche ===\n\nJune 2, 1501 \u2013 Following up on the discovery of Brazil the previous year, King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] had assembled a small exploratory expedition of three caravels under an unnamed Portuguese captain, and carrying the [[Republic of Florence|Florentine]] cosmographer [[Amerigo Vespucci]] aboard, to explore and map the coast of Brazil.  The exact identity of the captain is uncertain - some speculate it to be [[Gaspar de Lemos]] or [[Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves (explorer)|Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves]], whichever of the two had commanded the supply vessel that had delivered the news in June 1500; others conjecture Lemos/Gon\u00e7alves went merely as passengers, and that the expedition itself was commanded by [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]].<ref>[[Amerigo Vespucci]] wrote two detailed accounts of this Brazilian mapping expedition - in ''Mundus Novus'' (pub. 1502/03) and as the \"third voyage\" in ''Lettera a Soderini'' (pub.1504/05) - but does not identify the Portuguese captain by name in either.  Chronicler [[Gaspar Correia]], writing a half-century later, identifies the mapping captain as the same captain who steered the returning supply ship - ergo the Lemos/Gon\u00e7alves identification.  Greenlee (1945) suggests the captain was [[Fern\u00e3o de Loronha]], although this has been dismissed by others (e.g. Roukema, 1963).  More recently, historians have drawn attention to a nautical chart by [[Vesconte de Maggiolo]], which identifies the Brazilian landmass with the label ''Tera de Gonsalvo Coigo Vocatur Santa Cruz'' (translated as \"Land of [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]] called Santa Cruz\").  [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]] is known to have led a later expedition to Brazil (which set out in 1503), but it is commonly estimated that Coelho was still out at sea when Maggiolo composed his chart (c. 1504-05), thereby suggesting Coelho might have also captained the previous 1501 mapping expedition as well. (Morison, 1974, vol. 2, p.281)</ref> Setting out from Lisbon in May 1501, the little Brazilian mapping expedition made a watering stop in early June at ''Bezeguiche'' (as the bay of [[Dakar]] (Senegal) was known to the Portuguese sailors of the time) and stumbles upon  [[Diogo Dias]] cooling his heels there. Dias relates to the Portuguese captain and Vespucci the tales of his misadventures\u2014how he had been separated from Cabral at the Cape, how he had ventured up to the Gulf of Aden, and, finding no trace of Cabral on his return, decided to wait for him in Bezeguiche. Just two days later, the lead ship of the returning India fleet\u2014the ''Anunciada'' under [[Nicolau Coelho]]\u2014sails into Bezeguiche, surprised to find both Dias and the Brazilian mapping expedition there (apparently  Bezeguiche must have been a pre-arranged point of encounter for the Second Armada).\n\nFor the next two weeks, the captains and crews of the different ships exchange tales of their travels and adventures.  It has been since speculated that it was during this time that Amerigo Vespucci came up with his \"[[New World]]\" hypothesis.  After all, Vespucci was quite familiar with the Americas, having participated in [[Alonso de Ojeda|Ojeda]]'s 1499 expedition to the coasts of South America, and it is said he had intense discussions at Bezeguiche with [[Gaspar da Gama]], the Goese Jew aboard Coelho's ship, undoubtedly the person most familiar with the East Indies. Comparing notes, it probably dawned on Vespucci that it was simply impossible to square what he knew of the Americas with what the men of the 2nd Armada knew of Asia.  While still at Bezeguiche, Vespucci wrote a letter to [[Lorenzo de' Medici (1463\u20131503)|Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]], relating his encounter, which he sends back with some Florentine passengers on the ''Anunciada''.<ref>Vespucci's 1501 letter is reproduced in Varnhagen (1865).   An English translation can be found in W.H.Greenlee (1938: p.152ff).</ref>  This was a prelude to an even more famous letter of Vespucci to Lorenzo in 1503, shortly after his return, where he finally asserts that the Brazilian landmass was in fact a continent, that the lands discovered to the west were definitely not part of Asia, but must be an entirely different continent, a \"[[New World]]\".<ref>Vespucci (1503). After leaving Bezeguiche, the mapping expedition would make landfall at [[Cape S\u00e3o Roque]] in August 1501, and proceeded to sail south along the Brazilian coast, possibly as far as the [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]] coast. They returned to Lisbon before September 1502, perhaps as early as June. A second mapping expedition, this time more certainly under [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]], also accompanied by Vespucci (his \"fourth voyage\"), set out for Brazil in April, 1503.</ref>\n\nMid-June, 1501 \u2013 Lemos & Vespucci leave Bezeguiche for Brazil. Shortly after, the pair [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] and Sim\u00e3o de Miranda themselves reach Bezeguiche, where they find Diogo Dias and Nicolau Coelho awaiting them. Cabral sends Coelho's swift ''Anunciada'' ahead to Lisbon to announce their return, while the remainder rest and wait in Bezeguiche for the remaining two ships.  [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]]'s ship (making his way alone from Mossel Bay) and [[Sancho de Tovar]]'s ''S\u00e3o Pedro'' (returning from Sofala) arrive in Bezeguiche by the end of June.\n\nJune 23, 1501 \u2013 The ''Anunciada'', commanded by [[Nicolau Coelho]], arrives in Lisbon and anchors in [[Bel\u00e9m]].  (Just as in case of Vasco da Gama's expedition, it turns out Nicolau Coelho is once again the first to deliver the news!)  The merchants of the consortium led by [[Bartolomeo Marchionni]] (who own the ''Anunciada'') are delighted.  Letters are immediately fired off throughout Europe announcing the results.\n\nThe news arrives too late for [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]]'s [[3rd Portuguese India Armada (Nova, 1501)|3rd India Armada]], which departed for India in April.  But Nova will collect the necessary information along the way\u2014from the note in Ata\u00edde's shoe in Mossel Bay, and from Cabral's letters in the possession of Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes in Kilwa.\n\nJuly 21, 1501 \u2013 One month after Coelho's arrival, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral and Sim\u00e3o de Miranda, the two larger ships, finally arrive in Lisbon. The other three ships arrive a few days later: Sancho de Tovar and P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde on July 25 and the hapless Diogo Dias, with his empty caravel, on July 27.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n{{Refimprove-section|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:Bernardelli - Monumento a Cabral.jpg|thumb|180px|Monument to [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] in Lisbon, copy of a Brazilian monument by Rodolpho Bernardelli]]\nOn the surface, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral's 2nd Armada had been a failure and the reaction was conspicuously muted.\n\nShip losses were very heavy. Of the thirteen ships sent out, only five returned with cargo (four crown, one private), five were lost at sea, three returned without cargo (Gaspar de Lemos, Lu\u00eds Pires and Diogo Dias).\n\nHuman losses were even more disheartening.  This included all the crews and captains of the four ships lost at the Cape (notably, the celebrated discoverer Bartolomeu Dias).  Another fifty-something Portuguese (including the factor Aires Correia) had been killed in the Calicut massacre.\n\nThen there were the mission failures.  Relative to the instructions given to him in Lisbon, Cabral had failed on nearly every count:\n*1. failed to establish a treaty with the Zamorin of Calicut\u2014indeed, Calicut was now more hostile than ever.\n*2. failed to establish a factory at Calicut (massacred);\n*3. failed to bring the 'Hindu Church' in line (the friars that survived reported the Hindus weren't Christians after all, just 'idolaters');\n*4. failed to make a treaty with Kilwa;\n*5. failed to establish a factory at Sofala (seen from afar by Tovar, but that is all).\n\nOn the other hand, in his defense, Cabral could point to some positive achievements.\n\n*1. opening of friendly relations with Cochin, Canannore and Quilon;\n*2. a factory in Cochin, poorer than Calicut perhaps, but workable;\n*3. discovery of true Christian communities in Cranganore, etc.;\n*4. Sofala was at least discovered and scouted;\n*5. discovery of Brazil, which might serve as a useful staging post for future India runs;\n*6. Diogo Dias's discovery of Madagascar and exploration of the African coast up to Cape Guardafui and the Gulf of Aden was useful information.\n*7. Finally, Cabral did bring back tons of spices, which were off-loaded into the Lisbon warehouses and sold at no small profit for the crown treasury.\n\nHowever, it was the ship and human losses that weighed heavily against Cabral being honored or rewarded. Allegations of 'incompetence' flew easily in the circles that mattered. Although Cabral was initially offered the command of the [[4th Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1502)|4th Armada]], scheduled for 1502, it seemed more like a ''pro forma'' gesture than a sincere offer.<ref>Subrahmanyam (1997: p.191)</ref> The crown made it clear that Cabral's command would be limited and supervised \u2013 conditions humiliating enough to force Cabral to withdraw his name.  The 4th Armada would be placed under the command of [[Vasco da Gama]].\n\nAlthough the reaction of Portuguese court opinion in 1501, on Cabral's return, was generally low, it ascended retrospectively.  Cabral's discovery of Brazil, initially received as a minor discovery of little interest, turned out to be much more momentous.  The follow-up Brazilian mapping expeditions of 1501-02 and 1503-04, under the captaincy of [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]], carrying the Florentine cosmographer [[Amerigo Vespucci]], revealed a massive continent - which Vespucci famously labelled a \"[[New World]]\" (''Mundus Novus'').  The plentitude of [[brazilwood]] (''pau-brasil'') discovered by the mapping expeditions on its shores lured the interest of European cloth industry, and led to the 1505 contract granted to [[Fern\u00e3o de Loronha]] for the commercial exploitation of Brazil. The lucrative brazilwood trade eventually drew competition from French and Spanish interlopers, forcing the Portuguese government to take a more active interest in Cabral's \"[[Name of Brazil|Land of Vera Cruz]]\", finally leading to the establishment of the first Portuguese colonies in [[Colonial Brazil]] in 1532.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Carta de P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]]\n* [[Portuguese India Armadas]]\n* [[Portuguese India]]\n* [[Alternative theory of the European discovery of Brazil]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=note |30em}}\n\n== References == \n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n'''Eyewitness Accounts'''\n\n* [Anonymous Pilot] \"Navigationi del Capitano Pedro Alvares Cabral Scrita per un Piloto Portoghese et Tradotta di Lingua Portoghese in Italiana\", first published in Francanzano Montalbado, 1507, editor, ''Paesi novamente retrovati et Novo Mondo da Alberico Vesputio Florentino intitulato'', Vicenza.
