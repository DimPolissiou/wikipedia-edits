In summer 2006, he signed for his second Serie A club [[A.C. Chievo Verona|Chievo]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early career===\nBorn in [[Domodossola]], Piedmont, Squizzi started his career at [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], the club giant of the region. In 1994\u201395 season, he worked as [[Angelo Peruzzi]]'s backup, along with [[Michelangelo Rampulla]]. He played the final match of the season, which ''Le Zebre'' already secured the title weeks before. In the next season he left for [[Serie C1]] club [[SPAL 1907|SPAL]], where he worked as [[Oriano Boschin]]'s backup. In 1996\u201397 season, he left for [[A.S.D. Atletico Catania F.C.|Atletico Catania]], where he helped the club reached semi-final of promotion playoffs.\n\n===Lucchese===\nSquizzi secured a long-term contract with [[Serie B]] club [[A.S. Lucchese-Libertas|Lucchese]], where he helped the league struggler avoided relegation in the first season. In the second season, the poor scoring record made the club finished the second from the bottom, made Squizzi had to search another club.\n\n===Salernitana===\nSquizzi joined [[Salernitana Calcio 1919|Salernitana]] which newly relegated from [[Serie A]] in a [[co-ownership (football)|co-ownership]] deal, which also saw [[Ciro Polito]] moved to opposite direction. He worked as [[Fabrizio Lorieri]]'s backup, ahead youth product [[Rosario Niosi]], Lorieri himself also a new signing but from [[Serie A]] club [[U.S. Lecce|Lecce]]. He survived in mid-season sale, which saw Salernitana reduced the number of goalkeeper from 5 to 3 by sending ex-no.2 [[Andrea Ivan]] and youth product [[Crescenzo De Vito]] to [[A.S. Livorno Calcio|Livorno]] and [[S.S.C. Giugliano|Giugliano]] respectively. But after Salernitana failed to return to Serie A, all goalkeeper were left the club and replaced by [[Salvatore Soviero]], [[Domenico Botticella]] and youth product [[Raffaele Coscia]]. Ciro Polito, who was bought back from Lucchese, also transferred to [[U.S. Avellino 1912|Avellino]].\n\n===Serie C1 (2000\u201303)===\nIn November 2000, Squizzi signed for [[A.C. Reggiana 1919|Reggiana]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/2000/novembre/10/Squizzi_alla_Reggiana_Pierpaolo_Bresciani_ga_0_00111014009.shtml|title=Squizzi alla Reggiana, Pierpaolo Bresciani al Catania|date=10 November 2000|accessdate=8 January 2010|publisher=[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]|language=Italian}}</ref> He quickly became the first choice, ahead of [[Raffaele Nuzzo]]. With club they survived in the relegation play-out.\n\nIn the next season he secured another long-term contract with newly relegated side [[A.C. Monza Brianza 1912|Monza]], ahead of [[Luca Davide Righi]] and youth product [[Daniele Mandelli]]. But the team-mate failed to score into opponent nets once again made Squizzi tasted relegation.\n\nIn the next season he was loaned to [[A.C. Cesena|Cesena]] as the first-choice goalkeeper, ahead [[Francesco Musarra]] and [[Davide Bertaccini]], replacing [[Nicola Santoni]] who left for [[U.S. Citt\u00e0 di Palermo|Palermo]]. He concerned only 29 goals in the season, ranked 2 least among the teams, behind [[Pisa Calcio|Pisa]]. Although his team finished third and Pisa finished fourth, the team lost to Pisa in promotion playoffs semi-finals.\n\n===Catania===\nDue to Monza failing to win promotion, on 29 August 2003 Squizzi secured a move to [[Calcio Catania|Catania]] of [[Serie B]], ahead [[Emanuele Concetti]], [[Paolo Mancini]] (joined in January) and youth product [[Gaetano Romano]] as first choice. He concerned only 29 goals in 29 league matches with 11 clean sheets, but after injured in March, Concetti and Mancini concerned 15 goals in 9 league matches with 4 clean sheets and 4 goals in 4 matches with 1 clean sheet respectively between round 33 to 45. Squizzi returned to field on the last round, played 77 minutes as starter without concerned a goal, before replaced by Mancini. The match ended in 2\u20130 won to the second club ranked from the bottom.<ref>[http://it.euronews.net/eurofoot/?MAID=336443&TEID=1204&CTID=13&CPID=19&ListType=32&PLID=64088&pStr=Match_Details Euronews]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Perugia===\nHis performance made Perugia, which newly relegated to Serie B, sign him to provide extra cover for Australian international [[\u017deljko Kalac]]. He conceded 9 goals in 14 matches, with Kalac conceding 25 goals in 29 matches. Squizzi also played all 4 promotion playoffs that lost to [[Torino F.C.|Torino]] in the finals. But Perugia was expelled from Serie B due to financial problem.\n\n===Chievo===\nIn August 2005 Squizzi signed for [[A.C. Chievo Verona|Chievo]], his second Serie A club, initially as backup of [[Alberto Fontana (footballer born 1967)|Alberto Fontana]], along with youth product [[Enrico Alfonso]]. But in the first match of the season, he replaced Fontana at half time, after Chievo concerned a goal from [[David Trezeguet]], of his former team Juve. In that season, he occasionally played 12 league matches, 9 of them were starter.\n\nIn the next season, the club signed [[Vincenzo Sicignano]] from relegated Lecce to replace Fontana who left for [[U.S. Citt\u00e0 di Palermo|Palermo]]. But Squizzi was promoted to first choice in the 2 round (ahead youth product [[Mattia Passarini]]) and played one [[2006\u201307 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] match verse [[S.C. Braga|Sporting Braga]].<ref>[http://www.uefa.com/competitions/uefacup/history/season=2006/round=2364/match=84841/index.html Match Report UEFA.com]</ref> In the round 7 Sicignano regained his place but in February Squizzi restored as first choice, ahead his former team-mate [[Emanuele Concetti]] who signed in mid-season. Although Sicignano and Squizzi concerned 24 goals each, and ranked mid-table by terms of goals concerned, Chievo poor goal scoring, partially due to the left of [[Amauri]], made Sicignano and Squizzi once again tasted relegation.\n\nAt Serie B, Squizzi secured his place as first choice, ahead [[Gabriele Aldegani]] and [[Mattia Passarini]]. He won Serie B champion with team and returned to Serie A.\n\nSince the signing of [[Stefano Sorrentino]] in July 2008 and turned to age 34, he worked as backup goalkeeper again, along with Gabriele Aldegani (2008\u201309) and Micha\u0142 Mi\u015bkiewicz (2009\u201310).\n\nOn 7 June 2010, Chievo announced Squizzi had signed a new one-year contract.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chievoverona.it/societa/notizia.aspx?ID=10760|title=LORENZO SQUIZZI, UN'ALTRA STAGIONE CON IL CHIEVO|date=7 June 2010|accessdate=7 June 2010|work=AC ChievoVerona|language=Italian}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> He extended his contract again in July 2011<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chievoverona.tv/it/news/lorenzo-squizzi-un-altro-anno-giallobl%C3%B9|title=Lorenzo Squizzi: un altro anno in giallobl\u00f9|date=14 July 2011|accessdate=15 July 2011|work=AC ChievoVerona|language=Italian|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321093003/http://www.chievoverona.tv/it/news/lorenzo-squizzi-un-altro-anno-giallobl%C3%B9|archivedate=21 March 2012}}</ref> and 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chievoverona.tv/en/news/squizzi-and-chievo-together-again|title=Squizzi and Chievo together again|date=9 July 2012|accessdate=14 July 2012|publisher=AC ChievoVerona|language=Italian|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714113047/http://www.chievoverona.tv/en/news/squizzi-and-chievo-together-again|archivedate=14 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Honours==\n'''Juventus'''\n*[[Serie A]]: [[1994\u201395 Serie A|1994\u201395]]\n*[[Coppa Italia]]: [[1994\u201395 Coppa Italia|1994\u201395]]\n\n'''Chievo'''\n*[[Serie B]]: [[2007\u201308 Serie B|2007\u201308]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://aic.football.it/scheda/1473/squizzi-lorenzo.htm Profile at Football.it] {{in lang|it}}\n* [http://www.gazzetta.it/speciali/risultati_classifiche/2010/calcio/seriea/giocatori/giocatore_lorenzo_squizzi_272241791.shtml Profile at La Gazzetta dello Sport] {{in lang|it}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100128090405/http://www.chievoverona.it/primaSquadra/giocatore.aspx?giocatore=619 Profile at Chievo] {{in lang|it}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Squizzi, Lorenzo}}\n[[Category:1974 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:People from Domodossola]]\n[[Category:Italian footballers]]\n[[Category:Association football goalkeepers]]\n[[Category:Juventus F.C. players]]\n[[Category:S.P.A.L. players]]\n[[Category:S.S.D.

Chievo Verona|Chievo]] as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]].\n\nSquizzi started his career at [[Serie A]] team [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], but has spent most of his career in the lower divisions. In summer 2006, he signed for his second Serie A club Chievo.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early career===\nBorn in [[Domodossola]], Piedmont, Squizzi started his career at [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], the club giant of the region.

In the next season he left for [[Serie C1]] club [[SPAL 1907|SPAL]], where he worked as [[Oriano Boschin]]'s backup. In 1996\u201397 season, he left for [[A.S.D. Atletico Catania F.C.|Atletico Catania]], where he helped the club reached semi-final of promotion playoffs.\n\n===Lucchese===\nHe secured a long term contract with [[Serie B]] club [[A.S. Lucchese-Libertas|Lucchese]], where he helped the league struggler avoided relegation in the first season. In the second season, the poor scoring record made the club finished the second from the bottom, made Squizzi had to search another club.\n\n===Salernitana===\nHe joined [[Salernitana Calcio 1919|Salernitana]] which newly relegated from [[Serie A]] in a [[co-ownership (football)|co-ownership]] deal, which also saw [[Ciro Polito]] moved to opposite direction. He worked as [[Fabrizio Lorieri]]'s backup, ahead youth product [[Rosario Niosi]], Lorieri himself also a new signing but from [[Serie A]] club [[U.S. Lecce|Lecce]]. He survived in mid-season sale, which saw Salernitana reduced the number of goalkeeper from 5 to 3 by sending ex-no.2 [[Andrea Ivan]] and youth product [[Crescenzo De Vito]] to [[A.S. Livorno Calcio|Livorno]] and [[S.S.C. Giugliano|Giugliano]] respectively. But after Salernitana failed to return to Serie A, all goalkeeper were left the club and replaced by [[Salvatore Soviero]], [[Domenico Botticella]] and youth product [[Raffaele Coscia]]. Ciro Polito, who was bought back from Lucchese, also transferred to [[U.S. Avellino 1912|Avellino]].\n\n===Serie C1 (2000\u201303)===\nIn November 2000, he was signed by [[A.C. Reggiana 1919|Reggiana]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/2000/novembre/10/Squizzi_alla_Reggiana_Pierpaolo_Bresciani_ga_0_00111014009.shtml|title=Squizzi alla Reggiana, Pierpaolo Bresciani al Catania|date=10 November 2000|accessdate=8 January 2010|publisher=[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]|language=Italian}}</ref> He quickly became the first choice, ahead of [[Raffaele Nuzzo]]. With club they survived in the relegation play-out.\n\nIn the next season he secured another long-term contract with newly relegated side [[A.C. Monza Brianza 1912|Monza]], ahead of [[Luca Davide Righi]] and youth product [[Daniele Mandelli]]. But the team-mate failed to score into opponent nets once again made Squizzi tasted relegation.\n\nIn the next season he was loaned to [[A.C. Cesena|Cesena]] as the first-choice goalkeeper, ahead [[Francesco Musarra]] and [[Davide Bertaccini]], replacing [[Nicola Santoni]] who left for [[U.S. Citt\u00e0 di Palermo|Palermo]]. He concerned only 29 goals in the season, ranked 2 least among the teams, behind [[Pisa Calcio|Pisa]]. Although his team finished third and Pisa finished fourth, the team lost to Pisa in promotion playoffs semi-finals.\n\n===Catania===\nDue to Monza failed to win promotion, on 29 August 2003 he secured a move to [[Calcio Catania|Catania]] of [[Serie B]], ahead [[Emanuele Concetti]], [[Paolo Mancini]] (joined in January) and youth product [[Gaetano Romano]] as first choice. He concerned only 29 goals in 29 league matches with 11 clean sheets, but after injured in March, Concetti and Mancini concerned 15 goals in 9 league matches with 4 clean sheets and 4 goals in 4 matches with 1 clean sheet respectively between round 33 to 45. Squizzi returned to field on the last round, played 77 minutes as starter without concerned a goal, before replaced by Mancini. The match ended in 2\u20130 won to the second club ranked from the bottom.<ref>[http://it.euronews.net/eurofoot/?MAID=336443&TEID=1204&CTID=13&CPID=19&ListType=32&PLID=64088&pStr=Match_Details Euronews]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Perugia===\nHis performance made Perugia, which newly relegated to Serie B, signed him to provide extra cover for Australian internationals [[\u017deljko Kalac]]. He concerned 9 goals in 14 matches, with Kalac concerned 25 goals in 29 matches. Squizzi also played all 4 promotion playoffs that lost to [[Torino F.C.|Torino]] in the finals. But Perugia was expelled from Serie B due to financial problem.\n\n===Chievo===\nIn August 2005 he signed for [[A.C. Chievo Verona|Chievo]], his second Serie A club, initially as backup of [[Alberto Fontana (footballer born 1967)|Alberto Fontana]], along with youth product [[Enrico Alfonso]]. But in the first match of the season, he replaced Fontana at half time, after Chievo concerned a goal from [[David Trezeguet]], of his former team Juve. In that season, he occasionally played 12 league matches, 9 of them were starter.\n\nIn the next season, the club signed [[Vincenzo Sicignano]] from relegated Lecce to replace Fontana who left for [[U.S. Citt\u00e0 di Palermo|Palermo]]. But Squizzi was promoted to first choice in the 2 round (ahead youth product [[Mattia Passarini]]) and played one [[2006\u201307 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] match verse [[S.C.

The tectonic processes on the high Atlas proabaly lead to most of the Volcanic manifestations locally.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/> \n\n===Stratigraphy===\nThe formation is subdivided on several stratigraphic levels, starting with the so called  facies of term A, composed by  [[Gypsum]] and [[Salt]], from Triassic age, supported by the presence of Volcanic Intercalations of basalt.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain0 /><ref name=Allain1 /><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Above that, there are carbonates of term B alternated at the first with [[Dolomite (rock)|Dolomite]]s, [[Pelite]]s and [[Limestone]]s along with Marly-[[Silt]] crimes with plant debris, which had regular influence  of a marine environment.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> That is proved by the presence of [[Ooid]]s, [[Oncolith]]s, debris of [[Mollusc]]s and benthic [[Foraminifer]]s, being dissolved and recrystallized as [[Sparite]].<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The third level shows a transition between marine and continental deposits, through carbonate palustrine levels and [[Caliche]] horizons, being continental layers superimposed in stratigraphic continuity over the marine carbonates of the lower Lias ([[Sinemurian]]-[[Hettangian]]).<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Those continental layers are rich in [[Coarse structure|Coarse]] Volcano-detrital episodes as result of a sedimentary  process of  high sedimentation rates, where the strata,  including the deposit with Dinosaur fossils, where deposited on a short time interval, where Middle Jurassic [[Bajocian]]-[[Bathonian]] carbonate levels, frequent within the Atlas domain, do not exist not in Toundoute.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The sedimentation on the Toundoute member have some characteristics, such as  lenticular channels with [[Sieve]]-[[Conglomerate (geology)|Conglomerate]] of ~5 m thick (\u2264 5m) for visible decametric, composed of several materials, like  Volcanic products, as  blocks of volcanic rocks such as sands made of [[Feldspar]]s, black ferruginous grains from the surface of volcanic rocks on dry periods, siliceous green fragments from post eruption processes  ([[Vein (geology)|Vein]]s, [[Microgeode]]s, [[Nippled Concretions]]), [[Limestone]] debris with traces of roots and cracks, where in some parts traces dark fine bushy algae filaments are still visible, similar to te genus [[Girvanella]] blue-green algae.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Other materials include [[Schist]] and Vein [[Quartz]], witouth bone and wood debris with a good cellular structure.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The [[Floodplain]]-like deposits are divided in two parts, with hard [[Limestone]] nodules, pink or brick and very irregular, typical of profiles of [[Calcimorph Soils]] formed on climates with pronounced dry phases.

The winning entry was published in the weekend edition of the newspaper that coincided with what had effectively become, at that time, a local annual science fiction convention known as Albacon.\n\nIn 1986, Ann Karkalas of the [[University of Glasgow]] Adult & Continuing Education Department contacted the competition's judge, the writer (and the ''Herald'''s then-Science Fiction reviewer) [[Duncan Lunan]], about the possibility of starting a science fiction writing evening class. Both knew each other previously from the Glasgow Science Fiction Circle, a group of readers and writers which had met during the 1960s and 1970s. Duncan was willing to teach the course, and indeed the classes would go on to run for the best part of a decade.\n\nMany of those who attend the first year's class were so enthusiastic about writing that \u2013 once the class finished \u2013 they wanted to continue meeting. So they did; at the suggestion of Lunan, this new group began to refer to itself as the Glasgow Science Fiction Writers Circle, although the group remains remarkably anarchic and non-hierarchical in form.\n\nAlthough the Circle's early membership largely overlapped with that of the evening classes, the two entities gradually became more distinct. After the evening classes were ended, the Circle has continued to attract new members through word of mouth, brochure entries, and its own website.\n\nHaving survived several changes of venue, frequency of meetings and an almost complete turnover of members, the Circle currently meets every second Tuesday. Venues have included [[St Aloysius Church, Glasgow|St Aloysius Church]], the [[Glasgow Film Theatre]], the city's branch of Border's bookshop, and a smaller function room of a Glasgow church.<ref>{{Cite web|title = GSFWC FAQ|url = https://gsfwc.wordpress.com/gsfwc-faq/|website = Glasgow SF Writers' Circle|accessdate = 27 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Structure ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}} \nThe Circle's workshops are neither instructor-led nor formally arranged. Although the group does follow a set routine (modeled on the [[Milford Writer's Workshop|Milford]] Method, wherein each person who has read the story gives their comments before the author's final \"right of reply\" at the end of the session), the meetings are democratic in nature. The Circle does not engage in creative writing exercises: each meeting focuses specifically on the constructive criticism of an individual work, be it a short story, novella, or novel that has previously been distributed by email or via the Circle's newsgroup. This said, many members of the Circle do also regularly socialise with each other outside of these official meetings.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":0\"/>{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nIn late 2009, some members of the Circle established a spoken word performance group called Word Dogs. This ran irregular events in and around Glasgow, such as a special horror-themed evening around Halloween 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|title = http://ttapress.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1819|website = TTA}}</ref>\n\n== Other groups ==\nDuring its history the Circle has seldom interacted with other writers groups in and around Glasgow, thanks to its focused working practices and \u2013 arguably \u2013 its championing of genre fiction. As a result, probably its closest links have been with members of the East Coast SF Writers Group (ECSFWG). This group shared a common origin, having originally been formed as a gathering of some east coast-based entrants to the same ''Glasgow Herald'' Science Fiction Short Story Competition.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nA more recent offshoot from ECSFWG is the Writers' Bloc spoken word group, with whom members of the Circle have performed in special joint events.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\n==Published works==\nSince its inception, the circle has sponsored, or otherwise caused to be written, a number of anthologies. These are comprised of original works, most often short stories, by its members. The books typically commemorate an occasion, but the most recent was published to raise money for a charitable cause. \n\n*  ''Shipbuilding: New SF from Scotland'' (1995).

Duncan was willing to teach the course, and indeed the classes would go on to run for the best part of a decade.\n\nMany of those who attend the first year's class were so enthusiastic about writing that \u2013 once the class finished \u2013 they wanted to continue meeting. So they did; at the suggestion of Lunan, this new group began to refer to itself as the Glasgow Science Fiction Writers Circle, although the group remains remarkably anarchic and non-hierarchical in form.\n\nAlthough the Circle's early membership largely overlapped with that of the evening classes, the two entities gradually became more distinct. After the evening classes were ended, the Circle has continued to attract new members through word of mouth, brochure entries, and its own website.\n\nHaving survived several changes of venue, frequency of meetings and an almost complete turnover of members, the Circle currently meets every second Tuesday. Venues have included [[St Aloysius Church, Glasgow|St Aloysius Church]], the [[Glasgow Film Theatre]], the city's branch of Border's bookshop, and a smaller function room of a Glasgow church.<ref>{{Cite web|title = GSFWC FAQ|url = https://gsfwc.wordpress.com/gsfwc-faq/|website = Glasgow SF Writers' Circle|accessdate = 27 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Structure ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}} \nThe Circle's workshops are neither instructor-led nor formally arranged. Although the group does follow a set routine (modeled on the [[Milford Writer's Workshop|Milford]] Method, wherein each person who has read the story gives their comments before the author's final \"right of reply\" at the end of the session), the meetings are democratic in nature. The Circle does not engage in creative writing exercises: each meeting focuses specifically on the constructive criticism of an individual work, be it a short story, novella, or novel that has previously been distributed by email or via the Circle's newsgroup. This said, many members of the Circle do also regularly socialise with each other outside of these official meetings.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":0\"/>{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nIn late 2009, some members of the Circle established a spoken word performance group called Word Dogs. This ran irregular events in and around Glasgow, such as a special horror-themed evening around Halloween 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|title = http://ttapress.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1819|website = TTA}}</ref>\n\n== Other groups ==\nDuring its history the Circle has seldom interacted with other writers groups in and around Glasgow, thanks to its focused working practices and \u2013 arguably \u2013 its championing of genre fiction. As a result, probably its closest links have been with members of the East Coast SF Writers Group (ECSFWG). This group shared a common origin, having originally been formed as a gathering of some east coast-based entrants to the same ''Glasgow Herald'' Science Fiction Short Story Competition.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nA more recent offshoot from ECSFWG is the Writers' Bloc spoken word group, with whom members of the Circle have performed in special joint events.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\n==Published works==\nSince its inception, the circle has sponsored, or otherwise caused to be written, a number of anthologies. These are comprised of original works, most often short stories, by its members. The books typically commemorate an occasion, but the most recent was published to raise money for a charitable cause. \n\n*  '''''Shipbuilding: New SF from Scotland''''' Published for the 53rd World Science Fiction Convention in Glasgow.\n*  '''''Thirty Years of Rain''''' (ISBN: 9781326753429) To celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the Glasgow Sf Writers' Circle.\n*  '''''Flotation Device: A Charity Anthology''''' To support charities fighting COVID-19/coronavirus.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.gsfwc.co.uk Group website]\n\n[[Category:Scottish literature]]\n[[Category:Science fiction organizations]]\n[[Category:British writers' organisations]]\n[[Category:Writing circles]]\n[[Category:Speculative fiction writing circles]]\n[[Category:Arts organizations established in 1987]]\n[[Category:Members of the Glasgow Science Fiction Writers' Circle| ]]\n[[Category:Scottish science fiction]]\n[[Category:1987 establishments in Scotland]]\n", "name_user": "DanQuigley", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePublished works:Removed bold; inserted publication year.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Science_Fiction_Writers%27_Circle"}

It is famous for its Naini Lake located at the centre of the town and several other lakes of nearby areas.\n\nNainital Lake, in the [[Nainital district]] called the Lake District of India, is one of the four [[Lakes of Kumaon hills]]; the other three lakes are the [[Sattal Lake]], the [[Bhimtal Lake]] and the [[Naukuchiatal|Naukuchiyatal]] Lake.<ref>[http://www.worldlakes.org/uploads/Management_of_lakes_in_India_10Mar04.pdf Management of Lakes in India, Annex 2]</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Nainital Lake 1866.jpg|thumb|A view of the south end of the lake, 1866]]\nHistorical records confirm that in 1839, Mr. P. Barron, who is supposed to be the first one who visited [https://marathablogger.com/how-to-reach-nainital-from-delhi/ Nainital], from Rosa, an English business man in sugar trade, on an expedition accidentally coming across the lake at Nainital was so captivated that he decided to build a [[Europe]]an Colony on shores of the lake. The news magazine, the ''Englishman Calcutta'', reported in 1841 discovery of this lake near [[Almora]].<ref name = history>http://nainital.nic.in/history.htm Nainital History</ref>\nIt is believed that two Indian sages visited there, wandering, it is a belief of people that they blessed the lake with divine power, one can acquire divinement by taking bathe in it, and the same as in the Mansarovar lake.\n\nIntroducing - The Lake City of India. \nEnveloped in a thick foil of nature, accentuated by the scent of the flowering blossoms blending miraculously in the crisp fresh air, Nainital is truly the treasure trove of Kumaon. It is among the most visited hill stations of North India since British period. \n\nOne of the most amusing things all tourist would definitely get, while staying in the nainital, is the local food of bhotiya  market. Based on,research of the [\u00b6{(Daffodils Educational Institute, Haldwani)\u00b6}\u00ae]\u2122 and [\u00b6{(My Grooming House Private Limited)\u00b6}\u00ae]\u2713,Done together on the basis of the views and opinions of \nForeigner and local visiters and {\u00b6(Local residents, business tycoons, club players, college and school going students, Strollers, teachers, ancestors)\u00b6},The bhotiya market of Nainital district,is the highest visited place by the tourist worldwide in a session.In other words, having highest number of footfalls. Obviously this place deserve,Here you find amusing local foods i.e.(Momos,Thukpa, chowmin,dosha,chole bhature,etc.) and amusing shopping products together.\n Accordingly researchers of ({[DEI\u2122)\u00b6}] and [{(MGH)\u00b6}],\nAlong with bhotiya market ,there is a International historical and beautiful playing ground of spots i.e. hockey,Cricket, football, basketball and handball.Tourist those are found of cricket or football, could find and meet top skilled fit players, as like in England's Different names of sports club, visiters could hear, Shila Mount,killer's,Fun2toos, D.S.B Campus club.\nAll these places have more blessings of Goddess mother Naina Devi, ({[The Naina Devi Temple)}],is situated just beside these places and Lake. Along with temple there is a soothing and tranquillize Road, known as cold road(Thandi sadak in local dialect),this road is a kind of walkway and connected the upper(malli) nainital to lower(talli) nainital. This beautiful walkway somehow, could be the most amusing moments of visitor's life. Just besides of Temple there is a place call as zoom land by the tourist and locals of Nainital.\n\n\nPerched at an elevation of 2,084 metres above sea level, the glittering city of Nainital is hailed for being a parent to the ravishing Naini Lake from which it has earned the epithet of being the lake city. Nainital is not only a famous tourist destination but is also known for its prestigious educational institutions and schools which have stood since British era.\n\nThe Nainital town not only lures the domestic travelers and tourists but also a number of foreign tourists.  It shines as a glittering jewel in the Himalayan Mountains and is surrounded with lakes and nature's bounty.\n\n==Topography and Hydrology==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Nainital snow lake.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Lake view during snow season]] -->\nThe lake is bounded by the high and steep Naina peak on the North West side, by the Tiffin Top to the south west side and snow view peaks on the north. Coniferous forest trees cover these hill ranges. The annual [[rainfall]] in the basin area of the lake is reported to be 1294.5&nbsp;mm (43.15&nbsp;inches). Tropical monsoon climate with maximum temperature 24.6&nbsp;\u00b0C and minimum of 0.5&nbsp;\u00b0C are recorded. The water is reported to be alkaline in nature (ph value of 8.4\u20139.3).<ref name = invent/>\n\nThe lake receives flows from the surrounding catchment basin which comprises the hill slopes and [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]]. The hydrologic studies related to [[water balance]] and [[sedimentation]] was done using [[radioisotopes]] for estimating/measuring the various components of the [[inflow (hydrology)|inflow]] and [[Discharge (hydrology)|outflow]] into the lake. Studies indicated that the subsurface inflow and outflow were significant \u2013 ranging from 43 to 63% and 41 to 54%, respectively, of the total inflow and outflow, except in years of exceptionally heavy rainfall. The components of outflows were the surface outflow, the subsurface outflow through the springs on the downstream side and draft through wells for meeting the water supply of Nainital town and [[evaporation]] loss from the lake surface. The mean water retention time for the lake was computed as 1.16 years for the mean annual rainfall.<ref name = execut/>\n\n==Geology==\nThe [[Krol]] group of rocks, comprising [[slate]]s, [[marls]], [[sandstones]], [[limestones]] and [[dolomites]] with a few small dykes intrusives, is the dominant geological formation of the lake's surroundings. The lake is deduced to have been formed [[tectonic]]ally. Balia Nala, which is the main stream feeding the lake is along a [[fault line]] and the subsequent streams align parallel to major [[joints]] and [[fault (geology)|faults]]. 26 major drains feed the lake including the 3 perennial drains. The lake catchment has highly folded and faulted rocks due to poly phase deformation. [[Landslides]] are a frequent occurrence in the hill slopes surrounding the lake, which are steep. The slopes are highly vulnerable to landslides and mass movement due to various geological and human factors. Several landslides have occurred in the past (pictured) around the lake. Many settlements around the lake are located in landslide areas.<ref name = execut/>\n\n==Flora and fauna==\nWhile the Nainital district where the lake is situated (in the middle [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] ranges up to {{convert|2000|m|ft|abbr=on}}, a [[temperate zone]]), is rich in flora  (typical [[temperate climate]] plants) and fauna,  the details of the [[flora]] and [[fauna]] specific to the lake and its surroundings recorded are the following.<ref name=flora>[http://nainital.nic.in/flora.htm Introduction, Horticulture, Medicinal flora,  Animals and Fishes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407212245/http://nainital.nic.in/flora.htm |date=7 April 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Vegetation===\nThe trees and bushes grown in the region (lake's basin) with their botanical and common Indian names (in parenthesis) are reported to be: a) ''[[Quercus incana]]'' [[Oak]] (Banj); b) ''[[Aesculus indica]]'' (Pangar or Horse chestnuts); c) ''[[Juglans regia]]'' (Akhrot or walnut), d) ''[[Populus ciliata]]'' (Hill Pipal, a sacred tree); e) ''[[Fraxinus micrantha]]'' (Ash tree or Angu); f) ''[[Platanus orientalis]]'' (Chinar); g) ''[[Rubus lasiocarpus]]'' (Hisalu);  h) ''[[Rosa moschata]]'' (Kunj or Musk rose); i) ''[[Berberis asiatica]]'' (Kilmora);j) ''[[Cupressus torulosa]]'' (Surai or [[Himalayan cypress]]); k) ''[[Rhododendron arboreum]]'' (Buruns); ''[[Cedrus deodara]]'' (Deodar); l) ''Salix acmophylla''  ([[Salix babylonica#Horticultural selections and related hybrids|Weeping Willow]]); and m) ''[[Pinus]]'' (Pine).<ref name = flora/>\n\nThe Aquatic Macrophytic vegetation recorded are the a) ''[[Potamogeton pectinatus]]'', 2) ''Potamogeton crispus'', 3) ''Polygonum glabrum'', 4) ''Polygonum amphibium'' and ''[[Polygonum hydropiper]]'' ([[Water pepper]]).<ref name = flora/>\n\nSeveral species of medicinal flora and horticulture plants have also been reported.\n\n===Aqua fauna===\nThe fishes found in the lake are generally [[carps]] [[Mahseer]], (the [[Hindi]] name of mah\u0101sir, mah\u0101ser, or mah\u0101saul\u0101 used for a number of fishes of the group), also hill trout and the [[mirror carp]] which breed several times during one spawning season during May to September. Two species of Mahaseer fish viz., Tor tor: The red finned [[mahseer]] and the ''[[Tor putitora]]'': The yellow finned [[mahseer]], a food fish which grows to varying sizes from 20 to 60&nbsp;cm (7.87 to 23.62&nbsp;inches) are reported. The three species of Hill Trout found in the lake are the ''Schizothorax sinuatus'', ''Schizothorax richardsoni'' and ''Schizothorax plagiostornus''. The imported fish bred in the lake is Mirror carp or ''[[Cyprinus carpio]]''.<ref name = flora/> ''[[Gambusia affinis]]'' also called Mosquitofish has been introduced in the lake as a biocontrol measure to control [[Mosquito]] [[larva]]e.<ref name = flora/>\n\n===Fauna===\nNine species of birds and nine species of animals have been recorded in the Nainital district.\n\n==Water quality==\nA scientific study indicates that the open drains feeding the lake introduce [[toxic]] substances from the catchment of the lake, particularly [[heavy metals]] which get [[adsorb]]ed onto the suspended sediments, which in turn settle down in the bottom of the lake. A study of the risk assessment code has revealed that 4\u201313% of [[manganese]], 4\u20138% of [[copper]], 17\u201324% of [[nickel]], 3\u20135% of [[chromium]], 13\u201326% of [[lead]], 14\u201323% of [[cadmium]] and 2\u20133% of [[zinc]] exist in exchangeable fraction which puts the lake under the low to medium risk category and infers that it could enter into [[food chain]] and also cause deleterious effects to [[Aquatic ecosystem|aquatic]] life. This study provides the basic database to formulate guidelines for the [[dredging]] operations and/or restoration programmes in the lake.<ref>[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=18803276 Metal fractionation study on bed sediments of Lake Nainital, National Institute of Hydrology, Roorkee, Uttaranchal, India]</ref>\n\nThe water quality studies carried out by the National Institute of Hydrology during 1999\u20132001 on physico-chemical parameters ([[pH]], [[temperature]] profile, Secchi's transparency, [[dissolved oxygen]], [[Biochemical oxygen demand|BOD]], [[Chemical oxygen demand|COD]] and [[nutrients]]), biological profile (density of population, [[biomass]] and species diversity of phyto, [[zooplankton]] and [[macrobenthos]]) and bacteriological characteristics have led to the conclusion that long-term [[limnological]] changes have occurred in the lake. Excess of nutrients inflow have contributed to the [[eutrophic]] conditions and the internal recycling of nutrients from sediments during water circulation has resulted in luxurious growth of [[phytoplankton]]. The lake is thus anoxic and has reduced [[hypolimnion]], winter circulation, large phytoplankton and relatively lower animal population.<ref name = execut/>\n\n==Threats to the lake==\nThe problems facing the lake which were also listed in the plea in a [[Public Interest Litigation]] (PIL) before the [[Supreme Court of India]] in 1995 seeking court directive for redress measures could be summarised as below:<ref name = execut/>\n* The lake is [[eutrophic]] to high [[nutrient]] accumulation and growth of phytoplankton. [[Algal blooms]] had caused loss of transparency. In spite of installing sewer lines to prevent sewage entering the lake still some effluents from drains, leakage and open defecation add to the [[eutrophication]].\n* High [[Siltation]] resulting in reduction of lake depth (the depth of lake is reported to have reduced from its original depth of 27.97 m to only 19.6m.<ref name = shukla>http://www.india-today.com/itoday/20010205/profile.shtml Lady of the lake, Profile: Aradhana Shukla</ref>),\n* Clogging of water channels (drains) in the surrounding hills because of [[Structural encroachment|encroachment]], leading to poor drainage.\n* [[Landslides]] from the unstable hill slopes draining into the lake\n* Inadequate sanitation facilities for the poor section of society, commuters and tourists.\n\n==Lake restoration==\nThe National Institute of Hydrology (NIH) of [[Roorkee]] who prepared a plan for the restoration of the lake, at an estimated cost of Rs 50 crore (about US$10 million),  sponsored by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India,  are also now guiding the restoration measures.<ref>[http://www.thehindubusinessline.in/2004/07/10/stories/2004071001901900.htm Renewed focus on urban, rural water supply]</ref> The Conservation and Management Plan evolved by NIH is not only lake centric but also proposes to tackle the immediate periphery of the lake which contributes an adverse impact on the lake. The \"Nainital Jheel Parikshetra Vishesh Kshetra Vikas Pradhikaran\", the Lake Development Authority notified under U.P. Special Area Development Act 1986 is a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) set up for implementing the restoration works.<ref name = execut/> The restoration works that have been implemented or are in different stages of implementation are the following:\n* Limnological measures such as bottom aeration,<ref>[http://www.lakeandriverrestoration.com/ company that proposed, installed and commissioned aeration work]</ref> [[siphon]]ing of hypolimnetic water, biomanipulation and limited [[sediment]] removal from the deltas of drains which lead to the lake.\n* Soil Conservation & Slope Stabilization measures in the form of soil conservation and [[watershed management]] activities in the catchment area of the lake, slope stabilization, [[Drainage]] line treatment, [[landslide]] scars to be treated with [[Coir]] [[geotextiles]] with [[gabion]] cross-barriers and proper maintenance and cleaning of drainage system\n* Provide 100% coverage of the town surrounding the lake with sewers and Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs)\n* Improved [[sanitation]] around the lake and in the catchment with new community toilets to cover all sections of the society, improved design of household [[toilets]]\n* Better [[solid waste management]] by disposing of the solid waste through a chute to the downhill outside the catchment, developing [[landfill]] sites is developed and in isolated habitations in the upper reaches of hills, introduce composting measures with support from NGOs.\n* Limited [[dredging]] of the lake, particularly near the deltas of drains that bring sediments\n* Fish [[Gambusia affinis]] introduced a few years ago to control mosquito larvae, the fish have started feeding on the larger [[zooplankton]] resulting due to scanty [[larva]]e population resulting in adverse impact on the lake water quality. This needs to be controlled by putting minnow traps in the lake and introducing some other fish species\n* The outflow from the lake is into the Balia Nala drain controlled by a set of sluices located at the lake bridge. The sluices which are old need renovation and replacement. The Balia Nala also needs slope stabilization measures to check landslides\n[[File:Nainital landslip1880 BLcopyright2.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Landslide]] in 1880]]\n<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:NainitalTemple15.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Rebuilt Nainadevi temple after the landslide of 1880]] -->\n* [[Shoreline]] Development and improvement of facilities at all important monuments and temples located in the periphery of the lake and providing avenue paths and roads\n* Improved Public Awareness and Public Participation programmes\n* The \"Nainital Jheel Parikshetra Vishesh Kshetra Vikas Pradhikaran\" could function better in a limited role as a promoter and a facilitator for developmental and commercial activities with jurisdiction extended to cover all four lakes in the district, as at present a plethora of organizations are functioning in the notified area such as Nainital Nagar Palika Parishad, Jal Nigam, Irrigation Department, Power Corporation, Forest Department and Fisheries Department who are directly involved with the lake.\n\nThe Honourable Supreme Court of India in its judgment of 1995, in response to the Public Interest Litigation, gave the following recommendations which have also been addressed in the restoration measures mentioned above.<ref name = execut/><ref name = shukla/>\n\n<blockquote>\n(i)Sewage water has to be prevented at any cost from entering the lake; (ii) So far as the drains which ultimately fall in the lake are concerned, it has to be seen that building materials are not allowed to be heaped on the drains to prevent siltation of the lake;(iii) Care has been taken to see that horse dung does not reach the lake. If for this purpose the horse stand has to be shifted somewhere, the same would be done. The authorities would examine whether trotting of horses around the lake is also required to be prevented;(iv) Multi-storeyed group housing and commercial complexes have to be banned in the town area of Naini Tal. Building of small residential houses on flat areas could, however, be permitted;(v) The offence of illegal felling of trees is required to be made cognizable.(vi) Vehicular traffic on the Mall has to be reduced. Heavy vehicles may not be permitted to ply on Mall;(vii) The fragile nature of Ballia Ravine has to be taken care of. The cracks in the revetment of Ballia Nullah have to be repaired urgently.\n</blockquote>\n\nIn the \"India Today\" magazine, Prasanta Rajan, a journalist, in a preamble to the particular interest shown by the Lady [[District Magistrate]] of Nainital in restoration works of the lake has very vividly described the lake in these words: <blockquote>\nLook for the lake through the colonial windows of Pant House, a vintage [[England|English]] bungalow on the hilltop, now submerged in wintry night, solitary with a kind of [[Wuthering Heights]] mystery.

It is famous for its Naini Lake located at the centre of the town and several other lakes of nearby areas.\n\nNainital Lake, in the [[Nainital district]] called the Lake District of India, is one of the four [[Lakes of Kumaon hills]]; the other three lakes are the [[Sattal Lake]], the [[Bhimtal Lake]] and the [[Naukuchiatal|Naukuchiyatal]] Lake.<ref>[http://www.worldlakes.org/uploads/Management_of_lakes_in_India_10Mar04.pdf Management of Lakes in India, Annex 2]</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Nainital Lake 1866.jpg|thumb|A view of the south end of the lake, 1866]]\nHistorical records confirm that in 1839, Mr. P. Barron, who is supposed to be the first one who visited Nainital, from Rosa, an English business man in sugar trade, on an expedition accidentally coming across the lake at Nainital was so captivated that he decided to build a [[Europe]]an Colony on shores of the lake. The news magazine, the ''Englishman Calcutta'', reported in 1841 discovery of this lake near [[Almora]].<ref name = history>http://nainital.nic.in/history.htm Nainital History</ref>\nIt is believed that two Indian sages visited there, wandering, it is a belief of people that they blessed the lake with divine power, one can acquire divinement by taking bathe in it, and the same as in the Mansarovar lake.\n\n==Topography and Hydrology==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Nainital snow lake.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Lake view during snow season]] -->\nThe lake is bounded by the high and steep Naina peak on the North West side, by the Tiffin Top to the south west side and snow view peaks on the north. Coniferous forest trees cover these hill ranges. The annual [[rainfall]] in the basin area of the lake is reported to be 1294.5&nbsp;mm (43.15&nbsp;inches). Tropical monsoon climate with maximum temperature 24.6&nbsp;\u00b0C and minimum of 0.5&nbsp;\u00b0C are recorded. The water is reported to be alkaline in nature (ph value of 8.4\u20139.3).<ref name = invent/>\n\nThe lake receives flows from the surrounding catchment basin which comprises the hill slopes and [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]]. The hydrologic studies related to [[water balance]] and [[sedimentation]] was done using [[radioisotopes]] for estimating/measuring the various components of the [[inflow (hydrology)|inflow]] and [[Discharge (hydrology)|outflow]] into the lake. Studies indicated that the subsurface inflow and outflow were significant \u2013 ranging from 43 to 63% and 41 to 54%, respectively, of the total inflow and outflow, except in years of exceptionally heavy rainfall. The components of outflows were the surface outflow, the subsurface outflow through the springs on the downstream side and draft through wells for meeting the water supply of Nainital town and [[evaporation]] loss from the lake surface. The mean water retention time for the lake was computed as 1.16 years for the mean annual rainfall.<ref name = execut/>\n\n==Geology==\nThe [[Krol]] group of rocks, comprising [[slate]]s, [[marls]], [[sandstones]], [[limestones]] and [[dolomites]] with a few small dykes intrusives, is the dominant geological formation of the lake's surroundings. The lake is deduced to have been formed [[tectonic]]ally. Balia Nala, which is the main stream feeding the lake is along a [[fault line]] and the subsequent streams align parallel to major [[joints]] and [[fault (geology)|faults]]. 26 major drains feed the lake including the 3 perennial drains. The lake catchment has highly folded and faulted rocks due to poly phase deformation. [[Landslides]] are a frequent occurrence in the hill slopes surrounding the lake, which are steep. The slopes are highly vulnerable to landslides and mass movement due to various geological and human factors. Several landslides have occurred in the past (pictured) around the lake. Many settlements around the lake are located in landslide areas.<ref name = execut/>\n\n==Flora and fauna==\nWhile the Nainital district where the lake is situated (in the middle [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] ranges up to {{convert|2000|m|ft|abbr=on}}, a [[temperate zone]]), is rich in flora  (typical [[temperate climate]] plants) and fauna,  the details of the [[flora]] and [[fauna]] specific to the lake and its surroundings recorded are the following.<ref name=flora>[http://nainital.nic.in/flora.htm Introduction, Horticulture, Medicinal flora,  Animals and Fishes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407212245/http://nainital.nic.in/flora.htm |date=7 April 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Vegetation===\nThe trees and bushes grown in the region (lake's basin) with their botanical and common Indian names (in parenthesis) are reported to be: a) ''[[Quercus incana]]'' [[Oak]] (Banj); b) ''[[Aesculus indica]]'' (Pangar or Horse chestnuts); c) ''[[Juglans regia]]'' (Akhrot or walnut), d) ''[[Populus ciliata]]'' (Hill Pipal, a sacred tree); e) ''[[Fraxinus micrantha]]'' (Ash tree or Angu); f) ''[[Platanus orientalis]]'' (Chinar); g) ''[[Rubus lasiocarpus]]'' (Hisalu);  h) ''[[Rosa moschata]]'' (Kunj or Musk rose); i) ''[[Berberis asiatica]]'' (Kilmora);j) ''[[Cupressus torulosa]]'' (Surai or [[Himalayan cypress]]); k) ''[[Rhododendron arboreum]]'' (Buruns); ''[[Cedrus deodara]]'' (Deodar); l) ''Salix acmophylla''  ([[Salix babylonica#Horticultural selections and related hybrids|Weeping Willow]]); and m) ''[[Pinus]]'' (Pine).<ref name = flora/>\n\nThe Aquatic Macrophytic vegetation recorded are the a) ''[[Potamogeton pectinatus]]'', 2) ''Potamogeton crispus'', 3) ''Polygonum glabrum'', 4) ''Polygonum amphibium'' and ''[[Polygonum hydropiper]]'' ([[Water pepper]]).<ref name = flora/>\n\nSeveral species of medicinal flora and horticulture plants have also been reported.\n\n===Aqua fauna===\nThe fishes found in the lake are generally [[carps]] [[Mahseer]], (the [[Hindi]] name of mah\u0101sir, mah\u0101ser, or mah\u0101saul\u0101 used for a number of fishes of the group), also hill trout and the [[mirror carp]] which breed several times during one spawning season during May to September. Two species of Mahaseer fish viz., Tor tor: The red finned [[mahseer]] and the ''[[Tor putitora]]'': The yellow finned [[mahseer]], a food fish which grows to varying sizes from 20 to 60&nbsp;cm (7.87 to 23.62&nbsp;inches) are reported. The three species of Hill Trout found in the lake are the ''Schizothorax sinuatus'', ''Schizothorax richardsoni'' and ''Schizothorax plagiostornus''. The imported fish bred in the lake is Mirror carp or ''[[Cyprinus carpio]]''.<ref name = flora/> ''[[Gambusia affinis]]'' also called Mosquitofish has been introduced in the lake as a biocontrol measure to control [[Mosquito]] [[larva]]e.<ref name = flora/>\n\n===Fauna===\nNine species of birds and nine species of animals have been recorded in the Nainital district.\n\n==Water quality==\nA scientific study indicates that the open drains feeding the lake introduce [[toxic]] substances from the catchment of the lake, particularly [[heavy metals]] which get [[adsorb]]ed onto the suspended sediments, which in turn settle down in the bottom of the lake. A study of the risk assessment code has revealed that 4\u201313% of [[manganese]], 4\u20138% of [[copper]], 17\u201324% of [[nickel]], 3\u20135% of [[chromium]], 13\u201326% of [[lead]], 14\u201323% of [[cadmium]] and 2\u20133% of [[zinc]] exist in exchangeable fraction which puts the lake under the low to medium risk category and infers that it could enter into [[food chain]] and also cause deleterious effects to [[Aquatic ecosystem|aquatic]] life. This study provides the basic database to formulate guidelines for the [[dredging]] operations and/or restoration programmes in the lake.<ref>[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=18803276 Metal fractionation study on bed sediments of Lake Nainital, National Institute of Hydrology, Roorkee, Uttaranchal, India]</ref>\n\nThe water quality studies carried out by the National Institute of Hydrology during 1999\u20132001 on physico-chemical parameters ([[pH]], [[temperature]] profile, Secchi's transparency, [[dissolved oxygen]], [[Biochemical oxygen demand|BOD]], [[Chemical oxygen demand|COD]] and [[nutrients]]), biological profile (density of population, [[biomass]] and species diversity of phyto, [[zooplankton]] and [[macrobenthos]]) and bacteriological characteristics have led to the conclusion that long-term [[limnological]] changes have occurred in the lake. Excess of nutrients inflow have contributed to the [[eutrophic]] conditions and the internal recycling of nutrients from sediments during water circulation has resulted in luxurious growth of [[phytoplankton]]. The lake is thus anoxic and has reduced [[hypolimnion]], winter circulation, large phytoplankton and relatively lower animal population.<ref name = execut/>\n\n==Threats to the lake==\nThe problems facing the lake which were also listed in the plea in a [[Public Interest Litigation]] (PIL) before the [[Supreme Court of India]] in 1995 seeking court directive for redress measures could be summarised as below:<ref name = execut/>\n* The lake is [[eutrophic]] to high [[nutrient]] accumulation and growth of phytoplankton. [[Algal blooms]] had caused loss of transparency. In spite of installing sewer lines to prevent sewage entering the lake still some effluents from drains, leakage and open defecation add to the [[eutrophication]].\n* High [[Siltation]] resulting in reduction of lake depth (the depth of lake is reported to have reduced from its original depth of 27.97 m to only 19.6m.<ref name = shukla>http://www.india-today.com/itoday/20010205/profile.shtml Lady of the lake, Profile: Aradhana Shukla</ref>),\n* Clogging of water channels (drains) in the surrounding hills because of [[Structural encroachment|encroachment]], leading to poor drainage.\n* [[Landslides]] from the unstable hill slopes draining into the lake\n* Inadequate sanitation facilities for the poor section of society, commuters and tourists.\n\n==Lake restoration==\nThe National Institute of Hydrology (NIH) of [[Roorkee]] who prepared a plan for the restoration of the lake, at an estimated cost of Rs 50 crore (about US$10 million),  sponsored by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India,  are also now guiding the restoration measures.<ref>[http://www.thehindubusinessline.in/2004/07/10/stories/2004071001901900.htm Renewed focus on urban, rural water supply]</ref> The Conservation and Management Plan evolved by NIH is not only lake centric but also proposes to tackle the immediate periphery of the lake which contributes an adverse impact on the lake.

Special Area Development Act 1986 is a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) set up for implementing the restoration works.<ref name = execut/> The restoration works that have been implemented or are in different stages of implementation are the following:\n* Limnological measures such as bottom aeration,<ref>[http://www.lakeandriverrestoration.com/ company that proposed, installed and commissioned aeration work]</ref> [[siphon]]ing of hypolimnetic water, biomanipulation and limited [[sediment]] removal from the deltas of drains which lead to the lake.\n* Soil Conservation & Slope Stabilization measures in the form of soil conservation and [[watershed management]] activities in the catchment area of the lake, slope stabilization, [[Drainage]] line treatment, [[landslide]] scars to be treated with [[Coir]] [[geotextiles]] with [[gabion]] cross-barriers and proper maintenance and cleaning of drainage system\n* Provide 100% coverage of the town surrounding the lake with sewers and Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs)\n* Improved [[sanitation]] around the lake and in the catchment with new community toilets to cover all sections of the society, improved design of household [[toilets]]\n* Better [[solid waste management]] by disposing of the solid waste through a chute to the downhill outside the catchment, developing [[landfill]] sites is developed and in isolated habitations in the upper reaches of hills, introduce composting measures with support from NGOs.\n* Limited [[dredging]] of the lake, particularly near the deltas of drains that bring sediments\n* Fish [[Gambusia affinis]] introduced a few years ago to control mosquito larvae, the fish have started feeding on the larger [[zooplankton]] resulting due to scanty [[larva]]e population resulting in adverse impact on the lake water quality. This needs to be controlled by putting minnow traps in the lake and introducing some other fish species\n* The outflow from the lake is into the Balia Nala drain controlled by a set of sluices located at the lake bridge. The sluices which are old need renovation and replacement. The Balia Nala also needs slope stabilization measures to check landslides\n[[File:Nainital landslip1880 BLcopyright2.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Landslide]] in 1880]]\n<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:NainitalTemple15.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Rebuilt Nainadevi temple after the landslide of 1880]] -->\n* [[Shoreline]] Development and improvement of facilities at all important monuments and temples located in the periphery of the lake and providing avenue paths and roads\n* Improved Public Awareness and Public Participation programmes\n* The \"Nainital Jheel Parikshetra Vishesh Kshetra Vikas Pradhikaran\" could function better in a limited role as a promoter and a facilitator for developmental and commercial activities with jurisdiction extended to cover all four lakes in the district, as at present a plethora of organizations are functioning in the notified area such as Nainital Nagar Palika Parishad, Jal Nigam, Irrigation Department, Power Corporation, Forest Department and Fisheries Department who are directly involved with the lake.\n\nThe Honourable Supreme Court of India in its judgment of 1995, in response to the Public Interest Litigation, gave the following recommendations which have also been addressed in the restoration measures mentioned above.<ref name = execut/><ref name = shukla/>\n\n<blockquote>\n(i)Sewage water has to be prevented at any cost from entering the lake; (ii) So far as the drains which ultimately fall in the lake are concerned, it has to be seen that building materials are not allowed to be heaped on the drains to prevent siltation of the lake;(iii) Care has been taken to see that horse dung does not reach the lake. If for this purpose the horse stand has to be shifted somewhere, the same would be done. The authorities would examine whether trotting of horses around the lake is also required to be prevented;(iv) Multi-storeyed group housing and commercial complexes have to be banned in the town area of Naini Tal. Building of small residential houses on flat areas could, however, be permitted;(v) The offence of illegal felling of trees is required to be made cognizable.(vi) Vehicular traffic on the Mall has to be reduced. Heavy vehicles may not be permitted to ply on Mall;(vii) The fragile nature of Ballia Ravine has to be taken care of. The cracks in the revetment of Ballia Nullah have to be repaired urgently.\n</blockquote>\n\nIn the \"India Today\" magazine, Prasanta Rajan, a journalist, in a preamble to the particular interest shown by the Lady [[District Magistrate]] of Nainital in restoration works of the lake has very vividly described the lake in these words: <blockquote>\nLook for the lake through the colonial windows of Pant House, a vintage [[England|English]] bungalow on the hilltop, now submerged in wintry night, solitary with a kind of [[Wuthering Heights]] mystery. Down below, the lake is a laminated stillness, protected by seven never-sleeping hills.

It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Templeport and barony of [[Tullyhaw]].\n\n==Geography==\n\nStranadarragh is bounded on the north by [[Drumlougher]] townland, on the west by [[Bellaleenan]] and [[Ballymagirril]] townlands, on the south by [[Cornagunleog]] and [[Boley, Templeport|Boley]] townlands and on the east by [[Owengallees]] townland. Its chief geographical features are the [[River Blackwater, County Cavan]], marshes and dug wells. Stranadarragh is traversed by minor roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 155 statute acres.<ref name=\"IreAtlas\"/>\n\n==History==\n\nUntil the late 18th century, the modern townland of [[Cornagunleog]] formed part of Stranadarragh.\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey spells the name as ''Srahnedaragh''. The 1665 Down Survey map depicts it as ''Shanderagh''.<ref>Trinity College Dublin: [http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#bm=Tullaghhagh&c=Cavan&indexOfObjectValue=-1&indexOfObjectValueSubstring=-1 The Down Survey of Ireland.]</ref> [[William Petty]]'s 1685 map depicts it as ''Shanderagh''.<ref>[http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#c=Cavan]</ref>\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the proprietor as ''Lieutenant-Colonel Tristram Beresford'', who also appears as proprietor of other townlands in the survey. In the Hearth Money Rolls of 1662 there were no taxpayers paying the Hearth Tax in Stranadarragh.\n\nA grant dated 3 November 1666 was made by King [[Charles II of England]] to [[Sir Tristram Beresford, 1st Baronet]] which included, inter alia, the lands of ''Shranadanagh''. By grant dated 11 September 1670 from King Charles II of England to said Sir Tristram Beresford, the said lands of ''Shranadanagh'' were included in the creation of a new ''Manor of Beresford''.\n\nThe 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the townland name as ''Sranedaragh''.<ref>[http://www.cavanlibrary.ie/file/Local-Studies/Library-Scanned-Docs/The-Carvaghs-A-List-Of-The-Several-Baronies-And-Parishes-in-the-County-Of-Cavan.pdf]</ref>\n\nLowther Kirkwood of Mullinagrave, parish of Templeport, Co.
