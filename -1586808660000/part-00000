These versions, introduced in 1988, were informally referred to as \"second-generation\" models. To meet American [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] regulations, a steel plate with a stamped serial number was embedded into the receiver in front of the trigger guard. In 1991, an integrated recoil spring assembly replaced the original two-piece recoil spring and tube design. The magazine was slightly modified, changing the floorplate and fitting the follower spring with a resistance insert at its base.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==== Third-generation models ====\nIn 1998, the frame was further modified with an accessory rail (called the \"Universal Glock rail\") to allow the mounting of [[Laser applications#Laser sight|laser sights]], [[tactical light]]s, and other accessories. Thumb rests on both sides of the frame and finger grooves on the front strap were added. Glock pistols with these upgrades are informally referred to as (early) \"third-generation\" models. Later third-generation models additionally featured a modified extractor that serves as a [[Safety (firearms)#Loaded chamber indicator|loaded chamber indicator]], and the locking block was enlarged, along with the addition of an extra cross pin to aid the distribution of [[bolt thrust]] forces exerted by the locking block. This cross pin is known as the locking block pin and is located above the trigger pin.<ref name=\"wo\u017aniak\">{{Cite book |last=Wo\u017aniak |first=Ryszard |title=Encyklopedia najnowszej broni palnej&nbsp;\u2013 tom 2 G-\u0141 |year=2001 |location=Warsaw |publisher=Dom Wydawniczy Bellona |language=Polish |pages=45\u201350 |isbn=9788311091498 |oclc=749611548}}</ref>\n\nThe polymer frames of third-generation models can be black, flat dark earth, or [[olive drab]]. Besides that, non-firing dummy pistols (\"P\" models) and non-firing dummy pistols with resetting triggers (\"R\" models) have a bright red frame and [[Simunition]]-adapted practice pistols (\"T\" models) \u2013 a bright blue frame for easy identification.<ref>{{cite web|first=Ken |last=Lunde |url=http://lundestudio.com/glocks.html |title=Ken Lunde's Pistol Wallpaper Pages\u2014Assorted Glocks (Page 1 of 3) |publisher=Lundestudio.com |date=January 26, 2010 |accessdate=August 25, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014115656/http://lundestudio.com/glocks.html |archivedate=October 14, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, the Glock 22 RTF2 (Rough Textured Frame 2) (chambered in .40 S&W) was introduced.

Some of those did not have the fish gills.\n\n==== Fourth-generation models ====\nAt the 2010 [[SHOT Show]], Glock presented the \"fourth generation\", now dubbed \"Gen4\" by Glock itself.  Updates centered on ergonomics and the recoil spring assembly. The initial two fourth-generation models announced were the full-sized Glock 17 and Glock 22, chambered for the 9\u00d719&nbsp;mm Luger and .40 S&W cartridges, respectively. The pistols were displayed with a modified rough-textured frame, grip checkering, and interchangeable backstraps of different sizes. \"Gen4\" is rollmarked on the slide next to the model number to identify the fourth-generation pistols.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe basic grip size of the fourth-generation Glock pistols is slightly smaller compared to the previous design. A punch is provided to remove the standard trigger housing pin and replace it with the longer cross pin needed to mount the medium or large backstrap that will increase the trigger distance by {{convert|2|mm|in|abbr=on}} or {{convert|4|mm|in|abbr=on}}. With the medium backstrap installed, the grip size is identical to the third-generation pistols. The magazine release catches are enlarged and reversible for left-handed use. To use the exchangeable magazine release feature, fourth-generation Glock magazines have a notch cut on both sides of the magazine body. Earlier versions of the magazines will not lock into the Gen4 pistols if the user has moved the magazine release button to be operated by a left-handed user. Gen4 magazines will work in older models.<ref>{{cite web|work=All4Shooters|title=Glock pistols Gen3 VS Gen4.

Earlier subcompact Glock models such as the Glock 26 and Glock 30 have already used a dual recoil spring assembly that was carried over to the fourth-generation versions of those models. The slide and barrel shelf have been resized, and the front portion of the polymer frame has been widened and internally enlarged, to accommodate the dual recoil spring assembly. The trigger mechanism housing has also been modified to fit into the smaller-sized grip space.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lundestudio.com/2010SHOTShow/ |title=Ken Lunde's 2010 SHOT Show Photos & Report |publisher=Lundestudio.com |date=2010-01-30 |accessdate=2010-06-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120711182451/http://lundestudio.com/2010SHOTShow/ |archivedate=2012-07-11 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Guns Holsters and Gear |url=http://www.gunsholstersandgear.com/2010/01/20/more-gen-4-glock-photos/ |title=More Gen 4 Glock Photos |publisher=Gunsholstersandgear.com |date=2010-01-20 |accessdate=2010-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722050049/http://www.gunsholstersandgear.com/2010/01/20/more-gen-4-glock-photos/ |archive-date=2010-07-22 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.policeone.com/police-products/firearms/articles/1992665-SHOT-Show-2010-GLOCK-brings-pistols-into-the-next-generation/ |title=SHOT Show 2010: GLOCK brings pistols into the next generation |publisher=Policeone.com |date=2010-01-19 |accessdate=2010-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403082901/http://www.policeone.com/police-products/firearms/articles/1992665-SHOT-Show-2010-GLOCK-brings-pistols-into-the-next-generation |archive-date=2010-04-03 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Guns Holsters and Gear |url=http://www.gunsholstersandgear.com/2010/01/19/gen-4-glock-review-evolution-not-revolution/ |title=Gen 4 Glock Review: Evolution, not Revolution |publisher=Gunsholstersandgear.com |accessdate=2010-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527152040/http://www.gunsholstersandgear.com/2010/01/19/gen-4-glock-review-evolution-not-revolution/ |archive-date=2010-05-27 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Payton Miller |url=http://www.gunsandammo.com/article/glock-17-gen4 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130125051923/http://www.gunsandammo.com/article/glock-17-gen4 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-01-25 |title=Glock 17 Gen4 |publisher=gunsandammo.com |date=2011-02-09 |accessdate=2011-02-19 }}</ref>\n\nThe introduction of fourth-generation Glock pistols continued in July 2010 when the Glock 19 and Glock 23, the reduced size \"compact\" versions of the Glock 17 and Glock 22, became available for retail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.policemag.com/Channel/Weapons/News/2010/04/29/Glock-19-and-23-Gen4-Will-Arrive-This-Summer.aspx|title=Glock Gen4 G19 and G23 Will Arrive This Summer|accessdate=25 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225174421/http://www.policemag.com/channel/weapons/news/2010/04/29/glock-19-and-23-gen4-will-arrive-this-summer.aspx|archive-date=25 December 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> In late 2010, Glock continued the introduction of fourth-generation models with the Glock 26 and Glock 27 \"subcompact\" variants.\n\nIn January 2013, more fourth-generation Glock pistols were introduced commercially during the annual SHOT Show, including the Glock 20 Generation 4 along with other fourth-generation Glock models.\n\n=====2011 recoil spring assembly exchange program=====\nIn September 2011, Glock announced a recoil spring exchange program in which the manufacturer voluntarily offers to exchange the recoil spring assemblies of its fourth-generation pistols (with the exception of the \"subcompact\" Glock 26 and Glock 27 models) sold before 22 July 2011 at no cost \"to ensure our products perform up to GLOCK\u2019s stringent standards\", according to the company.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.teamglock.com/customer-service/recoil-spring-exchange |title=Recoil Spring Exchange Program |publisher=Glock USA |accessdate=June 3, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124080900/http://www.teamglock.com/customer-service/recoil-spring-exchange |archive-date=November 24, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==== M series ====\nOn 29 June 2016 the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) awarded a contract to Glock to provide new 9\u00d719mm Parabellum chambered duty pistols.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/06/30/news/companies/glock-gun-contract-fbi/|title=Glock wins $85 million FBI contract|first=Aaron|last=Smith|date=2016-06-30|access-date=2016-10-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005195243/http://money.cnn.com/2016/06/30/news/companies/glock-gun-contract-fbi/|archive-date=2016-10-05|url-status=live}}</ref> The solicitation specifications deviated from the specifications of Glock fourth-generation models.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=3003911f9f7ff35889bf5f46c48ba0ef&tab=core&_cview=1|title=9mm Luger Pistols / Replacement Parts -

During the recoil stroke, the barrel moves rearward initially locked together with the slide about {{convert|3|mm|in|abbr=on}} until the bullet leaves the barrel and chamber pressure drops to a safe level. A ramped lug extension at the base of the barrel then interacts with a tapered locking block integrated into the frame, forcing the barrel down and unlocking it from the slide. This camming action terminates the barrel's movement while the slide continues back under recoil, extracting and ejecting the spent cartridge casing. The slide's uninterrupted rearward movement and counter-recoil cycle are characteristic of the Browning system.<ref name=\"Kokalis\">Kokalis, Peter: ''Weapons Tests and Evaluations: The Best of Soldier of Fortune'', page 320. Paladin Press, 2001.</ref>\n\nGlock pistols incorporate a number of features intended to enhance reliability in adverse conditions, such as utilizing  advanced metal coatings, \"stub\" slide guides instead of true frame rails, and an unusual cocking mechanism wherein the trigger is partially responsible for cocking the striker.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guntweaks.com/glock-17-gen-4-review-and-dirt-test-2019.html|title=Glock 17 Gen 4 Review and Dirt Test|last=|first=|date=|website=GunTweaks.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> By relying partially on force from the shooter's trigger finger to cock the striker, a Glock effectively reduces the load on the recoil spring as the slide moves forward into battery, whereas almost all other striker-fired pistols on the market rely fully on the recoil spring to cock the striker. This design gives the recoil spring fewer tasks as the action cycles, helping to ensure that sufficient energy is available to strip a new round from the magazine and achieve full battery even when the breech, chamber, and/or magazine are heavily fouled. For these and other reasons, Glock pistols are commonly considered to be some of the most reliable striker-fired, semi-automatic handguns available, with some independent testing even showing a Glock taking a lead over a Sig Sauer P320<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guntweaks.com/p320-vs-glock-torture-test-which-is-best-2019.html|title=P320 vs Glock Torture Test|last=|first=|date=|website=GunTweaks.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> in a wet/dry reliability test, even though the latter was selected as the winner of the U.S. Army's [[XM17 Modular Handgun System competition|MHS]] competition.\n\n=== Features ===\n[[File:Glock 30-JH02.jpg|thumb|A subcompact Glock 30 field stripped to its main parts with a [[.45 ACP]] round|alt=|left]]\n\nThe slide features a spring-loaded claw [[Extractor (firearms)|extractor]], and the stamped [[sheet metal]] ejector is pinned to the trigger mechanism housing.<ref>Glock Armorer Manual 2012 p52</ref> Pistols after 2002 have a reshaped extractor that serves as a [[loaded chamber indicator]].

As the trigger is pulled, the firing pin is then fully cocked. At the end of its travel, the trigger bar is tilted downward by the connector, releasing the firing pin to fire the cartridge. The connector resets the trigger bar so that the firing pin will be captured in half-cock at the end of the firing cycle. This is known as a [[Trigger (firearms)#Pre-set|preset]] trigger mechanism, referred to as the \"[[Safe action|Safe Action]]\" trigger by the manufacturer. The connector ensures the pistol can only fire semiautomatically.\n\nThe factory-standard, two-stage trigger has a trigger travel of {{convert|12.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} and is rated at {{convert|25|N|lb-f|1|lk=on|abbr=on}}, but by using a modified connector, it can be increased to {{convert|35|N|lb-f|abbr=on|1}} or lowered to {{convert|20|N|lb-f|abbr=on|1}}. In response to a request made by American law enforcement agencies for a two-stage trigger with increased trigger pull, Glock introduced the NY1 (New York) trigger module, which features a flat spring in a plastic housing that replaces the trigger bar's standard coil spring. This trigger modification is available in two versions: NY1 and NY2 that are rated at {{convert|25|N|lb-f|abbr=on|1}} to {{convert|40|N|lb-f|abbr=on|1}} and {{convert|32|N|lb-f|abbr=on|1}} to {{convert|50|N|lb-f|abbr=on|1}}, respectively, which require about {{convert|20|N|lb-f|abbr=on|1}} to {{convert|30|N|lb-f|abbr=on|1}} of force to disengage the safeties and another {{convert|10|N|lb-f|abbr=on|1}} to {{convert|20|N|lb-f|abbr=on|1}} in the second stage to fire a shot.\n\nThe Glock's frame, magazine body, and several other components are made from a high-strength [[nylon]]-based [[polymer]] invented by Gaston Glock, called Polymer 2.<ref name=\"Kasler_136\">Kasler, 136</ref> This plastic was specially formulated to provide increased durability and is more resilient than [[carbon steel]] and most [[Alloy steel|steel alloys]].

It is retained in the frame by a steel axis pin that holds the trigger and slide catch. The trigger housing is held to the frame by means of a polymer pin. A spring-loaded sheet-metal pressing serves as the slide catch, which is secured from unintentional manipulation by a raised guard molded into the frame.\n\nThe Glock pistol has a relatively low slide profile, which holds the barrel axis close to the shooter's hand and makes the pistol more comfortable to fire by reducing [[muzzle rise]] and allows for faster aim recovery in rapid firing sequences.\nThe rectangular slide is [[Milling machine|milled]] from a single block of ordnance-grade steel using [[Numerical control|CNC]] machinery.<ref name=\"Kokalis_321\">Kokalis, 321</ref> The barrel and slide undergo two hardening processes prior to treatment with a proprietary [[nitriding]] process called [[Tenifer]]. The Tenifer treatment is applied in a {{convert|500|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} nitrate bath.<ref name=\"Kasler_136\"/> The Tenifer finish is between {{convert|0.04|and|0.05|mm|in|abbr=on|4}} in thickness, and is characterized by extreme resistance to wear and corrosion; it penetrates the metal, and treated parts have similar properties even below the surface to a certain depth.<ref name=\"Kasler_137\">Kasler, 137</ref>\n\nThe Tenifer process produces a matte gray-colored, nonglare surface with a 64 [[Rockwell scale|Rockwell C]] hardness rating and a 99% resistance to salt water corrosion (which meets or exceeds [[stainless steel]] specifications),<ref name=\"Kokalis_321\"/> making the Glock particularly suitable for individuals carrying the pistol [[Concealed carry in the United States|concealed]] as the highly chloride-resistant finish allows the pistol to better endure the effects of perspiration.<ref name=\"Kasler_137\"/> Glock steel parts using the Tenifer treatment are more corrosion resistant than analogous gun parts having other finishes or treatments, including [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]], [[Bluing (steel)|bluing]], [[Chrome plating#industrial chrome|hard chrome plating]], or phosphates.<ref name=\"Kasler_137\"/> During 2010 Glock switched from the salt bath nitriding Tenifer process to a not exactly disclosed [[Ferritic nitrocarburizing#Gaseous ferritic nitrocarburizing|gas nitriding]] process. After applying the nitriding process, a black [[Parkerized]] decorative surface finish is applied. The underlying nitriding treatment will remain, protecting these parts even if the decorative surface finish were to wear off.<ref name=\"MetalTreatments\" />\n\nA current production Glock 17 consists of 34 parts.<ref name=\"us.glock.com\"/> For maintenance, the pistol disassembles into five main groups: the barrel, slide, frame, magazine, and recoil-spring assembly. The firearm is designed for the [[NATO]]-standard 9\u00d719mm Parabellum [[Handgun|pistol]] [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]], but can use high-power (increased pressure) +P ammunition with either full-metal-jacket or jacketed hollow-point projectiles.\n\n=== Barrel ===\n[[File:Glock 17 9mmPara 004.jpg|thumb|upright|Standard sighting arrangement of a \"first-generation\" Glock 17]]\n\nThe hammer-forged barrel has a female type [[polygonal rifling]] with a right-hand twist. The stabilization of the round is not by conventional [[rifling]], using lands and grooves, but rather through a polygonal profile consisting of a series of six or eight interconnected noncircular segments (only the .45 ACP and .45 GAP have octagonal polygonal rifling). Each depressed segment within the interior of the barrel is the equivalent of a groove in a conventional barrel. Thus, the interior of the barrel consists of smooth arcs of steel rather than sharply defined slots.\n\nInstead of using a traditional [[Broaching (metalworking)|broaching machine]] to cut the rifling into the bore, the hammer forging process involves beating a slowly rotating [[mandrel]] through the bore to obtain the [[hexagon]]al or [[octagon]]al shape.<ref name=\"Kasler_138\">Kasler, 138</ref> As a result, the barrel's thickness in the area of each groove is not compromised as with conventional square-cut barrels. This has the advantage of providing a better gas seal behind the projectile as the bore has a slightly smaller diameter, which translates into more efficient use of the combustion gases trapped behind the bullet,<ref name=\"Kasler_138\"/> slightly greater (consistency in) muzzle velocities, and increased accuracy and ease of maintenance.<ref name=\"Barrel History\">{{cite web |url=http://atlantisarms.com/History/Barrel%20History.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420102209/http://atlantisarms.com/History/Barrel%20History.htm |archivedate=April 20, 2010 |title=Barrels |publisher=AtlantisArms.com |date=2004 |accessdate=June 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe newer lines of Glock pistols - i.e. Gen5, G42/43 - are equipped with the ''Glock Marksmanship Barrel'', or GMB. While older barrels were somewhat difficult to identify a bullet as coming from a particular barrel with high enough reliability for evidentiary use, the newer GMB ones are designed differently. A recent study by Stephen Christen and Hans Rudolf Jordi, and published by ''Forensic Science International'' in February 2019, shows that the new GMB barrels leave more identifiably unique markings on the fired projectile. These marks were more easily identified than previous pistol barrel markings, and were sufficient for reliably tying a bullet to a particular barrel. The study used a comparison microscope and an ABIS (Evofinder).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Christen |first1=Stephan |last2=Jordi |first2=Hans Rudolf |title=Individuality testing of new Glock pistol barrels 'Marksman Barrel' |journal=Forensic Science International |date=February 2019 |volume=295 |pages=64\u201371 |doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2018.11.028 |pmid=30572221 }}</ref>\n\n=== Safety ===\nGlock pistols lack a traditional on-off safety lever, which Glock markets as an advantage, especially to police departments, as the user is able to fire immediately without separately manipulating a safety.<ref name=bloom-safety>{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2009-09-09/glock-pistol-used-by-police-raised-safety-issues |title=Glock Pistol Used by Police Raised Safety Issues |last1=Barrett|first1=Paul |last2=Grow|first2=Brian  |website=Bloomberg.com |publisher=Bloomberg Business |accessdate=2016-01-02 |date=2009-09-09}}</ref> Instead, the pistols are designed with three independent safety mechanisms to prevent accidental discharge. The system, designated \"Safe Action\" by Glock, consists of an external [[Trigger safety|integrated trigger safety]] and two automatic internal safeties: a firing pin safety and a drop safety.<ref>{{cite web |title=Safe-action system on Glock.com |url=https://us.glock.com/technology/safe-action |accessdate=2016-08-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623235719/https://us.glock.com/technology/safe-action |archive-date=2016-06-23 |url-status=live }}</ref> The external safety is a small inner lever contained in the trigger. Pressing the lever activates the trigger bar and sheet metal connector. The firing pin safety is a solid hardened steel pin that, in the secured state, blocks the firing pin channel (disabling the firing pin in its longitudinal axis). It is pushed upward to release the firing pin for firing only when the trigger is actuated and the safety is pushed up through the backward movement of the trigger bar. The drop safety guides the trigger bar in a ramp that is released only when direct rearward pressure is applied to the trigger. The three safety mechanisms are automatically disengaged one after the other when the trigger is squeezed, and are automatically reactivated when the trigger is released.<ref name=\"Wo\u017aniak\" /><ref>{{cite web |last=Barrett |first=Paul |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/09_38/b4147038111680.htm |title=Glock Pistol Used by Police Raised Safety Issues |publisher=Businessweek.com |date=2009-09-10 |accessdate=2010-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115022230/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/09_38/b4147038111680.htm |archive-date=2010-01-15 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, Glock announced the Internal Locking System (ILS) safety feature. The ILS is a manually activated lock located in the back of the pistol's grip. It is cylindrical in design and, according to Glock, each key is unique. When activated, the lock causes a tab to protrude from the rear of the grip, giving both a visual and tactile indication as to whether the lock is engaged or not. When activated, the ILS renders the Glock unfireable, as well as making it impossible to disassemble. When disengaged, the ILS adds no further safety mechanisms to the Glock pistol. The ILS is available as an option on most Glock pistols. Glock pistols cannot be retrofitted to accommodate the ILS. The lock must be factory-built in Austria and shipped as a special order.\n\n=== Feeding ===\n[[File:Glock 17 magazine.JPG|thumb|upright|Glock 9\u00d719mm Parabellum 17-round magazine. The numbered witness holes at the back portion visually indicate how many cartridges are contained in the magazine.]]\nThe Glock 17 feeds from staggered-column or double stack [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]]s that have a 17-round capacity (which can be extended to 19 with an optional floor plate) or optional 24 or 33-round [[high-capacity magazine]]s.<ref>[http://www.glock.com/english/index_magazines.htm Glock magazines] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208011649/http://www.glock.com/english/index_magazines.htm |date=December 8, 2010 }}</ref> For jurisdictions which restrict magazine capacity to 10 rounds, Glock offers single-stack, 10-round magazines. The magazines are made of steel and are overmolded with plastic. A steel spring drives a plastic follower. After the last cartridge has been fired, the slide remains open on the slide stop. The slide stop release lever is located on the left side of the frame directly beneath the slide and can be manipulated by the thumb of the right-handed shooter.\n\nGlock magazines are interchangeable between models of the same caliber, meaning that a compact or subcompact pistol will accept magazines designed for the larger pistols chambered for the same round. However, magazines designed for compact and subcompact models will not function in larger pistols because they are not tall enough to reach the slide and magazine release. For example, the subcompact Glock 26 will accept magazines from both the full-size Glock 17 and the compact Glock 19, but the Glock 17 will not accept magazines from the smaller Glock 19 or the Glock 26.  The magazines for the Glock 36, the Glock 42, the Glock 43, and the Glock 44 are all unique; they cannot use magazines intended for another model, nor can their magazines be used in other models.\n\n=== Sights ===\nThe Glock 17 has a fixed polymer combat-type [[iron sight|sighting arrangement]] that consists of a ramped front sight and a notched rear sight with white contrast elements painted on for increased acquisition speed \u2013 a white dot on the front post and a rectangular border on the rear notch. The rear sight can be adjusted for windage (on certain models due to the windage sights not coming as factory default),  as it has a degree of lateral movement in the dovetail it is mounted in. Three other factory rear sight configurations are available in addition to the standard {{convert|6.5|mm|in|adj=on|abbr=on|2}} height sight: a lower impact {{convert|6.1|mm|in|adj=on|abbr=on|2}} sight, and two higher impact versions \u2013 {{convert|6.9|mm|in|abbr=on|2}} and {{convert|7.3|mm|in|abbr=on|2}}.<ref name=\"Kokalis_322\">Kokalis, 322</ref>\n\n=== Accessories ===\n {{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = 220\n   | footer    =\n   | image1    = Glock34 with gtl22.jpg\n   | alt1      =\n   | caption1  = Glock 34 with a GTL 22 attachment featuring a dimmable xenon white light and a red laser\n   | image2    = D150211dv1047.jpg\n   | alt2      =\n   | caption2  = A military diver displaying a Glock 17 fitted with maritime spring cups (not visible in picture, these are part of the internal mechanism)\n   | image3    = GlockOrig.jpg\n   | alt23     =\n   | caption3  = Polymer holster for Glock pistols\n  }}\n\nThe Glock pistol accessories available from the factory include several devices for tactical illumination, such as a series of front rail-mounted \"Glock tactical lights\" featuring a white [[tactical light]] and an optional visible laser sight. An alternate version of the tactical light using an invisible [[infrared]] light and laser sight is available, designed to be used with an infrared [[night vision device]]. Another lighting accessory is an adapter to mount a flashlight onto the bottom of a magazine.\n\nPolymer holsters in various configurations and matching magazine pouches are available. In addition, Glock produces optional triggers, recoil springs, slide stops, magazine release levers, and maritime spring cups. Maritime spring cups are designed to allow the pistol to be fired immediately after being submerged in water. They feature additional openings that allow liquids to flow and escape around them, offering enhanced reliability when water has penetrated into the firing pin assembly channel.\n\nMagazine floor plates (or +2 baseplates), which expand the capacity of the standard magazines by two rounds, are available for models chambered for the 9\u00d719mm Parabellum, .45 GAP, [[.40 S&W]], [[.357 SIG]], and [[.380 ACP]] cartridges. In addition to the standard nonadjustable polymer sight line, three alternative sight lines are offered by Glock. These consist of steel, adjustable, and self-illuminating [[Tritium sights|tritium]] night rear sights and factory steel and self-illuminating tritium contrast pointer steel front sights.\n\n== Variants ==\nFollowing the introduction of the Glock 17, numerous variants and versions have been offered. Variants that differ in caliber, frame, and slide length are identified by different model numbers with the exception of the Glock 17L.\n\nGlock pistols are made in five form factors, all modeled after the original full-sized Glock 17. \"Standard\" models are designed as full-sized duty firearms with a large magazine capacity. \"Compact\" models are slightly smaller with reduced magazine capacity and lighter weight while maintaining a usable grip length. \"[[Subcompact pistols|Subcompact]]\" models are designed for easier carry and being lighter and shorter, are intended to be used with two fingers on the grip below the trigger guard and lack an accessory rail like the larger, after generation two, Glock models. The .45 ACP and [[10mm Auto]] models have bigger, wider slides and are slightly larger than the smaller-chambered pistols and are available in the subcompact models Glock 29 (10 mm) and Glock 30 (.45 ACP). Glock produces five models of single-stack \"Slimline\" subcompact pistols, the Glock 36 in .45 ACP, the Glock 42 in .380 ACP, and the Glock 43, 43x, and 48 in 9\u00d719mm. The 43x and the 48 have longer grips that allow for a full three-finger hold and a 10-round capacity. \"Competition\" versions have longer barrels and slides, adjustable sights, an extended slide and magazine release.\n\nBeginning in 2007, Glock introduced several \"Short Frame\" models designated by the suffix \"SF\". The short frame was originally designed to compete in the now cancelled U.S. military [[Joint Combat Pistol]] trials for a new .45 ACP pistol to replace the [[M9 pistol]]. Glock's entry featured an optional ambidextrous magazine release and [[Picatinny rail|MIL-STD-1913]] rail along with a reduction in the size of the backstrap. The Glock 21SF is currently available in three versions: one with a Picatinny rail and ambidextrous magazine release and two with a Universal Glock rail available with or without the ambidextrous magazine release. Current 10mm and .45 ACP Glock magazines are manufactured with ambidextrous magazine release cutouts. As of January 2009, the Glock 20, 21, 29, and 30 were offered in short-framed variations. These models incorporate a {{convert|2.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} reduction in trigger reach, and full-sized models feature a {{convert|4|mm|in|adj=on|abbr=on}} reduction in heel depth, which corresponds to an overall reduction in length for those models.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gunholstersandmore.com/glock-17-holsters/ |title=Reuters announcement for Glock models |accessdate=2017-04-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170416220902/http://www.gunholstersandmore.com/glock-17-holsters/ |archive-date=2017-04-16 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>[http://www.ibtimes.com/prnews/20080202/ga-glock-30-sf-45.htm \"Glock, Inc.

Several modified versions of the Glock 17 have been introduced:\n** '''Glock 17L''': Introduced in 1988, the 17L incorporates a longer slide and extended barrel. Initially, the Glock 17L had three holes in the top of the barrel and a corresponding slot in the slide; however, later production pistols lack the holes in the barrel. The Glock 17L is manufactured in limited quantities.\n** '''Glock 17C''': Introduced in 1996, the 17C incorporates slots cut in the barrel and slide to [[Muzzle brake|compensate for recoil]]. Many other Glock pistols now come with this option, all with a \"C\" suffix on the slide.\n** '''Glock 17MB''': The 17MB is a version with ambidextrous magazine catch. This model, along with the other MB variants, was no longer available upon the introduction of the fourth-generation models, which have a reversible magazine catch.\n** '''Glock 17M''': Introduced in 2016, the 17M was created in response to an FBI solicitation for a new 9mm pistol. Differences from the Generation 4 model include removal of the finger grooves, ambidextrous slide lock, rounded slide nose profile, flared magazine well with new magazine baseplates, and a tougher finish on metal components. The Glock 17M also abandons the polygonal rifling of previous models for conventional rifling.<ref>{{Cite web |author=Handgun Planet (staff) |date=March 30, 2017 |title=Glock 17M: The 'Inside' Scoop (Photo Documentary) |url=https://handgunplanet.com/review/glock-17m-the-inside-scoop-photo-documentary/ |publisher=Handgun Planet |access-date=July 30, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180711064050/https://handgunplanet.com/review/glock-17m-the-inside-scoop-photo-documentary/ |archive-date=July 11, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> {{as of|2017}}, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], the [[South Carolina Highway Patrol]] and the [[Ontario Provincial Police]]<ref name=\"glock.com\">{{cite press release |title=Ontario Provincial Police Replaces its Current Pistols with GLOCK Pistols |url=https://us.glock.com/press%20release/pages/ontario%20provincial%20police%20replaces%20its%20current%20pistols%20with%20glock%20pistols |date=June 12, 2017 |publisher=U.S. Headquarters, GLOCK |access-date=July 30, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180730080551/https://us.glock.com/press%20release/pages/ontario%20provincial%20police%20replaces%20its%20current%20pistols%20with%20glock%20pistols |archive-date=July 30, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> have adopted the pistol as standard.\n\n[[File:MarineCorpsGlock18.jpg|thumb|The Glock 18, chambered in 9\u00d719mm Parabellum, fitted with a detachable shoulder stock and being fired in fully automatic mode]]\n[[File:Glock 18C.jpg|thumb|Glock 18C (compensated) in the third generation, unloaded and equipped with 19-rounds magazine, fire selector set to single fire]]\n\n* '''Glock 18''': The Glock 18{{Anchor|Glock 18}} is a [[selective fire|selective-fire]] variant of the Glock 17, developed at the request of the Austrian [[counter-terrorism|counter-terrorist]] unit [[EKO Cobra]], and as a way to internally test Glock components under high strain conditions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2017/08/17/tfb-tv-glock-18-machine-pistol-mini-documentary/ |title=TFB TV Glock 18 Machine Pistol Mini-Documentary |publisher=The Firearm Blog |date=17 August 2017 |access-date=11 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012043620/http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2017/08/17/tfb-tv-glock-18-machine-pistol-mini-documentary/ |archive-date=12 October 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Originally produced in 1986, this [[machine pistol]]\u2013class firearm has a lever-type fire-control selector switch, installed on the serrated portion of the rear left side of the slide. With the selector lever in the bottom position, the pistol fires [[Automatic firearm|fully automatically]], and with the selector lever in the top position, the pistol fires semi-automatically. The firearm is typically used with an extended 33-round-capacity magazine, although other magazines from the Glock 17 can be used, with available capacities of 10, 17, 19 or 24 rounds. Unlike all its other pistols, Glock is highly secretive about Glock 18 models, not including them on its official websites or its public catalogues,<ref name=\"guns.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.guns.com/2017/08/07/glock-18-the-machine-pistol/|title=Hands-on with Glock 18: The elusive machine pistol (VIDEO)|date=7 August 2017|publisher=Guns.com|access-date=11 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011232935/http://www.guns.com/2017/08/07/glock-18-the-machine-pistol/|archive-date=11 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> and because of the pistol's nature, it is only offered to military, law enforcement, and government organizations,<ref name=\"guns.com\"/> and its production details are highly classified. Early Glock 18 models were ported to reduce [[muzzle rise]] during automatic fire. A very early design introduced a longer ported barrel which was soon discarded as it would not fit in a holster. Another compensated variant was produced, known as the Glock 18C. It has a keyhole opening cut into the forward portion of the slide, similar to the opening on the Glock long-slide models, although the Glock 18 has a standard-length slide. The keyhole opening provides an area to allow the four, progressively larger (from back to front) compensator cuts machined into the barrel to vent the propellant gases upwards, affording more control over the rapid-firing machine pistol.\n** '''Glock 18C''': The compensator cuts start about halfway back on the top of the barrel. The two rear cuts are narrower than the two front cuts. The slide is hollowed, or dished-out, in a rectangular pattern between the rear of the ejection port and the rear sight. The rate of fire in fully automatic mode is around 1,100\u20131,200 rounds per minute. Most of the other characteristics are equivalent to the Glock 17, although the slide, frame, and certain fire-control parts of the Glock 18 are not interchangeable with other Glock models.<ref>[http://www.janes.com/extracts/extract/jiw/jiw_0006.html Janes.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213084320/http://www.janes.com/extracts/extract/jiw/jiw_0006.html |date=February 13, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cybershooters.org/?page_id=528 |title=Glock 18 interchangeability with Glock 17 |publisher=Cybershooters.org |accessdate=2009-07-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622091944/https://www.cybershooters.org/?page_id=528 |archive-date=2015-06-22 |url-status=live }}</ref>[[File:GLOCK 19.JPG|thumb|The compact Glock 19 in 9\u00d719mm Parabellum]]\n* '''Glock 19''': The Glock 19 {{Anchor|Glock 19}} is effectively a reduced-size Glock 17, called the \"Compact\" by the manufacturer. It was first produced in 1988, primarily for military and law enforcement. The Glock 19's barrel and pistol grip are shorter by about {{convert|12|mm|in|abbr=on|1}} than the Glock 17, and it uses a magazine with a standard capacity of 15 rounds. The pistol is compatible with factory magazines from the Glock 17 and Glock 18, giving the Glock 19 available capacities of: 17 rounds (standard magazine with +2 extension), 10, 17, and 19 (standard Glock 17 magazine with +2), 24 and 26 (standard magazine with +2 extension) and the 31 (standard Glock 18 magazine with +2 removed) and 33 rounds of the Glock 18. To preserve the operational reliability of the short recoil system, the mass of the slide remains the same as in the Glock 17 from which it is derived. With the exception of the slide, frame, barrel, locking block, recoil spring, guide rod, and slide lock spring, all of the other components are interchangeable between the models 17 and 19.

It features a Glock 19 slide with a Glock 17 frame in coyote color instead of the regular black color the Glock usually comes in. The frame includes a lanyard loop and a front lip in the magazine which purpose is to make changing magazines with gloves on easier, but this means the new Gen 5 17-round magazines cannot be used in the Glock 19X because the front lip will block the extended magazine floor plates from locking into the 19X's magazine well.

It features a smaller frame compared to the Glock 19, with a pistol grip that supports only two fingers, a shorter barrel and slide, and a double-stack magazine with a standard capacity of 10 rounds. A factory magazine with a +2 extension gives a capacity of 12 rounds. In addition, factory magazines from the Glock 17, Glock 18, and Glock 19, with capacities of 15, 17, 19, 24, 31 and 33 rounds, will function in the Glock 26.

It was developed and produced in 1998, and compared to the Glock 17, features a {{convert|21|mm|abbr=on|1}} longer barrel and slide. It has an extended magazine release, extended slide stop lever, {{convert|20|N|lb-f|1|lk=on|abbr=on}} trigger pull, and an adjustable rear sight. The sides at the front of the slide are slanted instead of squared. Further, the top of the slide and parts of its inside are milled out, creating a conspicuous hole at the top designed to reduce front-end muzzle weight to better balance the pistol and reduce the overall weight of the slide.<ref>{{cite news |last=Ayoob |first=Massad |url=http://www.themodernsurvivalist.com/archives/81 |title=The Glock 34 |work=[[Guns (magazine)|Guns]] |date=September 1999 |publisher=The Modern Survivalist |access-date=March 1, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301182714/http://www.themodernsurvivalist.com/archives/81 |archive-date=March 1, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* '''Glock 43''': The Glock 43{{Anchor|Glock 43}} is a \"slimline\" version of the subcompact Glock 26 that features an ultracompact slide and frame.

The pistol uses a modified slide, frame, and barrel to account for the differences in size and power of the .40 S&W cartridge. The standard magazine capacity is 15 rounds. The Glock Model 22 is favored and used by multiple law enforcement agencies around the world, including the [[Baltimore Police Department]], [[Los Angeles Police Department]], [[Miami Police Department]], [[Maryland State Police]], [[Overland Park Police Department]], [[Kansas City Police Department]], [[Missouri State Highway Patrol]], and [[Alaska State Troopers]] in the United States; the [[New South Wales Police Force#Firearms|NSW Police Force]] and [[Queensland Police Service#Equipment|Queensland Police Service]] in Australia; the [[Edmonton Police Service]], [[Calgary Police Service]], [[Alberta Sheriffs Branch]], [[Toronto Police Service]], [[Ottawa Police Service]], and [[British Columbia Sheriff Service]] in Canada; and the [[National Bureau of Investigation (Philippines)]], among others.\n* '''Glock 23''': The Glock 23 {{Anchor|Glock 23}} is a .40 S&W version of the compact Glock 19.

Unusual for a blowback design, the barrel is not fixed to the frame.  It moves rearward in recoil until it is tilted below the slide, similar to the standard locked-breech system.

These versions, introduced in 1988, were informally referred to as \"second-generation\" models. To meet American [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] regulations, a steel plate with a stamped serial number was embedded into the receiver in front of the trigger guard. In 1991, an integrated recoil spring assembly replaced the original two-piece recoil spring and tube design. The magazine was slightly modified, changing the floorplate and fitting the follower spring with a resistance insert at its base.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==== Third-generation models ====\nIn 1998, the frame was further modified with an accessory rail (called the \"Universal Glock rail\") to allow the mounting of [[Laser applications#Laser sight|laser sights]], [[tactical light]]s, and other accessories. Thumb rests on both sides of the frame and finger grooves on the front strap were added. Glock pistols with these upgrades are informally referred to as (early) \"third-generation\" models. Later third-generation models additionally featured a modified extractor that serves as a [[Safety (firearms)#Loaded chamber indicator|loaded chamber indicator]], and the locking block was enlarged, along with the addition of an extra cross pin to aid the distribution of [[bolt thrust]] forces exerted by the locking block. This cross pin is known as the locking block pin and is located above the trigger pin.<ref name=\"wo\u017aniak\">{{Cite book |last=Wo\u017aniak |first=Ryszard |title=Encyklopedia najnowszej broni palnej&nbsp;\u2013 tom 2 G-\u0141 |year=2001 |location=Warsaw |publisher=Dom Wydawniczy Bellona |language=Polish |pages=45\u201350 |isbn=9788311091498 |oclc=749611548}}</ref>\n\nThe polymer frames of third-generation models can be black, flat dark earth, or [[olive drab]]. Besides that, non-firing dummy pistols (\"P\" models) and non-firing dummy pistols with resetting triggers (\"R\" models) have a bright red frame and [[Simunition]]-adapted practice pistols (\"T\" models) \u2013 a bright blue frame for easy identification.<ref>{{cite web|first=Ken |last=Lunde |url=http://lundestudio.com/glocks.html |title=Ken Lunde's Pistol Wallpaper Pages\u2014Assorted Glocks (Page 1 of 3) |publisher=Lundestudio.com |date=January 26, 2010 |accessdate=August 25, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014115656/http://lundestudio.com/glocks.html |archivedate=October 14, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, the Glock 22 RTF2 (Rough Textured Frame 2) (chambered in .40 S&W) was introduced.

Some of those did not have the fish gills.\n\n==== Fourth-generation models ====\nAt the 2010 [[SHOT Show]], Glock presented the \"fourth generation\", now dubbed \"Gen4\" by Glock itself.  Updates centered on ergonomics and the recoil spring assembly. The initial two fourth-generation models announced were the full-sized Glock 17 and Glock 22, chambered for the 9\u00d719&nbsp;mm Luger and .40 S&W cartridges, respectively. The pistols were displayed with a modified rough-textured frame, grip checkering, and interchangeable backstraps of different sizes. \"Gen4\" is rollmarked on the slide next to the model number to identify the fourth-generation pistols.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe basic grip size of the fourth-generation Glock pistols is slightly smaller compared to the previous design. A punch is provided to remove the standard trigger housing pin and replace it with the longer cross pin needed to mount the medium or large backstrap that will increase the trigger distance by {{convert|2|mm|in|abbr=on}} or {{convert|4|mm|in|abbr=on}}. With the medium backstrap installed, the grip size is identical to the third-generation pistols. The magazine release catches are enlarged and reversible for left-handed use. To use the exchangeable magazine release feature, fourth-generation Glock magazines have a notch cut on both sides of the magazine body. Earlier versions of the magazines will not lock into the Gen4 pistols if the user has moved the magazine release button to be operated by a left-handed user. Gen4 magazines will work in older models.<ref>{{cite web|work=All4Shooters|title=Glock pistols Gen3 VS Gen4.

Earlier subcompact Glock models such as the Glock 26 and Glock 30 have already used a dual recoil spring assembly that was carried over to the fourth-generation versions of those models. The slide and barrel shelf have been resized, and the front portion of the polymer frame has been widened and internally enlarged, to accommodate the dual recoil spring assembly. The trigger mechanism housing has also been modified to fit into the smaller-sized grip space.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lundestudio.com/2010SHOTShow/ |title=Ken Lunde's 2010 SHOT Show Photos & Report |publisher=Lundestudio.com |date=2010-01-30 |accessdate=2010-06-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120711182451/http://lundestudio.com/2010SHOTShow/ |archivedate=2012-07-11 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Guns Holsters and Gear |url=http://www.gunsholstersandgear.com/2010/01/20/more-gen-4-glock-photos/ |title=More Gen 4 Glock Photos |publisher=Gunsholstersandgear.com |date=2010-01-20 |accessdate=2010-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722050049/http://www.gunsholstersandgear.com/2010/01/20/more-gen-4-glock-photos/ |archive-date=2010-07-22 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.policeone.com/police-products/firearms/articles/1992665-SHOT-Show-2010-GLOCK-brings-pistols-into-the-next-generation/ |title=SHOT Show 2010: GLOCK brings pistols into the next generation |publisher=Policeone.com |date=2010-01-19 |accessdate=2010-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403082901/http://www.policeone.com/police-products/firearms/articles/1992665-SHOT-Show-2010-GLOCK-brings-pistols-into-the-next-generation |archive-date=2010-04-03 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Guns Holsters and Gear |url=http://www.gunsholstersandgear.com/2010/01/19/gen-4-glock-review-evolution-not-revolution/ |title=Gen 4 Glock Review: Evolution, not Revolution |publisher=Gunsholstersandgear.com |accessdate=2010-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527152040/http://www.gunsholstersandgear.com/2010/01/19/gen-4-glock-review-evolution-not-revolution/ |archive-date=2010-05-27 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Payton Miller |url=http://www.gunsandammo.com/article/glock-17-gen4 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130125051923/http://www.gunsandammo.com/article/glock-17-gen4 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-01-25 |title=Glock 17 Gen4 |publisher=gunsandammo.com |date=2011-02-09 |accessdate=2011-02-19 }}</ref>\n\nThe introduction of fourth-generation Glock pistols continued in July 2010 when the Glock 19 and Glock 23, the reduced size \"compact\" versions of the Glock 17 and Glock 22, became available for retail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.policemag.com/Channel/Weapons/News/2010/04/29/Glock-19-and-23-Gen4-Will-Arrive-This-Summer.aspx|title=Glock Gen4 G19 and G23 Will Arrive This Summer|accessdate=25 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225174421/http://www.policemag.com/channel/weapons/news/2010/04/29/glock-19-and-23-gen4-will-arrive-this-summer.aspx|archive-date=25 December 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> In late 2010, Glock continued the introduction of fourth-generation models with the Glock 26 and Glock 27 \"subcompact\" variants.\n\nIn January 2013, more fourth-generation Glock pistols were introduced commercially during the annual SHOT Show, including the Glock 20 Generation 4 along with other fourth-generation Glock models.\n\n=====2011 recoil spring assembly exchange program=====\nIn September 2011, Glock announced a recoil spring exchange program in which the manufacturer voluntarily offers to exchange the recoil spring assemblies of its fourth-generation pistols (with the exception of the \"subcompact\" Glock 26 and Glock 27 models) sold before 22 July 2011 at no cost \"to ensure our products perform up to GLOCK\u2019s stringent standards\", according to the company.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.teamglock.com/customer-service/recoil-spring-exchange |title=Recoil Spring Exchange Program |publisher=Glock USA |accessdate=June 3, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124080900/http://www.teamglock.com/customer-service/recoil-spring-exchange |archive-date=November 24, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==== M series ====\nOn 29 June 2016 the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) awarded a contract to Glock to provide new 9\u00d719mm Parabellum chambered duty pistols.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/06/30/news/companies/glock-gun-contract-fbi/|title=Glock wins $85 million FBI contract|first=Aaron|last=Smith|date=2016-06-30|access-date=2016-10-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005195243/http://money.cnn.com/2016/06/30/news/companies/glock-gun-contract-fbi/|archive-date=2016-10-05|url-status=live}}</ref> The solicitation specifications deviated from the specifications of Glock fourth-generation models.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=3003911f9f7ff35889bf5f46c48ba0ef&tab=core&_cview=1|title=9mm Luger Pistols / Replacement Parts -

Some conspicuous changes on the fifth-generation models are: ambidextrous slide stop levers, nDLC ([[Diamond-like carbon|Diamond-Like Carbon]]) surface finish for barrel and slide, a barrel featuring a revised style of polygonal rifling (called the \"Glock Marksman Barrel\" by Glock), a deeper recessed barrel crown, omission of the finger grooves on the grip, a flared magazine well, and a reintroduction of a (half moon shaped) cutout on the bottom front of the grip. The locking block pin located above the trigger pin that was introduced in the third generation is omitted. Many internal parts were less conspicuously revised.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2017/08/25/glock-gen5/|title=OFFICIAL: The New GLOCK Gen5 Has Arrived - The Firearm Blog|date=25 August 2017|access-date=26 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826234417/http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2017/08/25/glock-gen5/|archive-date=26 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2017/08/25/gen5-glock-17-19/|title=TFB FIRST LOOK: The New Gen5 GLOCK 17 And Gen5 GLOCK 19 - The Firearm Blog|date=25 August 2017|access-date=26 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826234620/http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2017/08/25/gen5-glock-17-19/|archive-date=26 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ammoland.com/2017/08/glock-gen-5-safe-action-pistols/|title=GLOCK Gen 5 Safe Action Pistols, First Look at New GLOCK 17 & 19|date=2017-08-25|access-date=2017-08-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826235744/https://www.ammoland.com/2017/08/glock-gen-5-safe-action-pistols/|archive-date=2017-08-26|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.recoilweb.com/inside-the-glock-gen-5-129141.html|title=Here's the Full Reveal of the New Glock Gen5 Pistol - RECOIL|date=24 August 2017|access-date=26 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826234305/http://www.recoilweb.com/inside-the-glock-gen-5-129141.html|archive-date=26 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.northeastcoating.com/products/dlc-coating|title=High Performance DLC Coatings Give You the Diamond Edge  |publisher=North East Coating Technologies |access-date=2017-09-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904011405/http://www.northeastcoating.com/products/dlc-coating |archive-date=2017-09-04|url-status=live}}</ref> \"Gen 5\" is rollmarked on the slide next to the model number to identify the fifth-generation pistols.

During the recoil stroke, the barrel moves rearward initially locked together with the slide about {{convert|3|mm|in|abbr=on}} until the bullet leaves the barrel and chamber pressure drops to a safe level. A ramped lug extension at the base of the barrel then interacts with a tapered locking block integrated into the frame, forcing the barrel down and unlocking it from the slide. This camming action terminates the barrel's movement while the slide continues back under recoil, extracting and ejecting the spent cartridge casing. The slide's uninterrupted rearward movement and counter-recoil cycle are characteristic of the Browning system.<ref name=\"Kokalis\">Kokalis, Peter: ''Weapons Tests and Evaluations: The Best of Soldier of Fortune'', page 320. Paladin Press, 2001.</ref>\n\nGlock pistols incorporate a number of features intended to enhance reliability in adverse conditions, such as utilizing  advanced metal coatings, \"stub\" slide guides instead of true frame rails, and an unusual cocking mechanism wherein the trigger is partially responsible for cocking the striker.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guntweaks.com/glock-17-gen-4-review-and-dirt-test-2019.html|title=Glock 17 Gen 4 Review and Dirt Test|last=|first=|date=|website=GunTweaks.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> By relying partially on force from the shooter's trigger finger to cock the striker, a Glock effectively reduces the load on the recoil spring as the slide moves forward into battery, whereas almost all other striker-fired pistols on the market rely fully on the recoil spring to cock the striker. This design gives the recoil spring fewer tasks as the action cycles, helping to ensure that sufficient energy is available to strip a new round from the magazine and achieve full battery even when the breech, chamber, and/or magazine are heavily fouled. For these and other reasons, Glock pistols are commonly considered to be some of the most reliable striker-fired, semi-automatic handguns available, with some independent testing even showing a Glock taking a lead over a Sig Sauer P320<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guntweaks.com/p320-vs-glock-torture-test-which-is-best-2019.html|title=P320 vs Glock Torture Test|last=|first=|date=|website=GunTweaks.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> in a wet/dry reliability test, even though the latter was selected as the winner of the U.S. Army's [[XM17 Modular Handgun System competition|MHS]] competition.\n\n=== Features ===\n[[File:Glock 30-JH02.jpg|thumb|A subcompact Glock 30 field stripped to its main parts with a [[.45 ACP]] round|alt=|left]]\n\nThe slide features a spring-loaded claw [[Extractor (firearms)|extractor]], and the stamped [[sheet metal]] ejector is pinned to the trigger mechanism housing.<ref>Glock Armorer Manual 2012 p52</ref> Pistols after 2002 have a reshaped extractor that serves as a [[loaded chamber indicator]].

As the trigger is pulled, the firing pin is then fully cocked. At the end of its travel, the trigger bar is tilted downward by the connector, releasing the firing pin to fire the cartridge. The connector resets the trigger bar so that the firing pin will be captured in half-cock at the end of the firing cycle. This is known as a [[Trigger (firearms)#Pre-set|preset]] trigger mechanism, referred to as the \"[[Safe action|Safe Action]]\" trigger by the manufacturer. The connector ensures the pistol can only fire semiautomatically.\n\nThe factory-standard, two-stage trigger has a trigger travel of {{convert|12.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} and is rated at {{convert|25|N|lb-f|1|lk=on|abbr=on}}, but by using a modified connector, it can be increased to {{convert|35|N|lb-f|abbr=on|1}} or lowered to {{convert|20|N|lb-f|abbr=on|1}}. In response to a request made by American law enforcement agencies for a two-stage trigger with increased trigger pull, Glock introduced the NY1 (New York) trigger module, which features a flat spring in a plastic housing that replaces the trigger bar's standard coil spring. This trigger modification is available in two versions: NY1 and NY2 that are rated at {{convert|25|N|lb-f|abbr=on|1}} to {{convert|40|N|lb-f|abbr=on|1}} and {{convert|32|N|lb-f|abbr=on|1}} to {{convert|50|N|lb-f|abbr=on|1}}, respectively, which require about {{convert|20|N|lb-f|abbr=on|1}} to {{convert|30|N|lb-f|abbr=on|1}} of force to disengage the safeties and another {{convert|10|N|lb-f|abbr=on|1}} to {{convert|20|N|lb-f|abbr=on|1}} in the second stage to fire a shot.\n\nThe Glock's frame, magazine body, and several other components are made from a high-strength [[nylon]]-based [[polymer]] invented by Gaston Glock, called Polymer 2.<ref name=\"Kasler_136\">Kasler, 136</ref> This plastic was specially formulated to provide increased durability and is more resilient than [[carbon steel]] and most [[Alloy steel|steel alloys]]. Polymer 2 is resistant to shock, [[Corrosive substance|caustic liquids]], and temperature extremes where traditional steel/alloy frames would warp and become brittle.<ref name=\"Kasler_136\"/> The [[Injection molding|injection-molded]] frame contains four hardened steel guide rails for the slide: two at the rear of the frame, and the remaining pair above and in front of the trigger guard. The trigger guard itself is squared off at the front and checkered. The grip has an angle of 109\u00b0 and a nonslip, [[Stippling#Other uses|stippled]] surface on the sides and both the front and rear straps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shootingillustrated.com/articles/2011/1/13/steyr-m40-a1/|title=Steyr M40-A1|website=www.shootingillustrated.com|access-date=2016-04-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805235909/https://www.shootingillustrated.com/articles/2011/1/13/steyr-m40-a1/|archive-date=2016-08-05|url-status=live}}</ref> The frame houses the locking block, which is an [[investment casting]] that engages a 45\u00b0 camming surface on the barrel's lower camming lug. It is retained in the frame by a steel axis pin that holds the trigger and slide catch. The trigger housing is held to the frame by means of a polymer pin. A spring-loaded sheet-metal pressing serves as the slide catch, which is secured from unintentional manipulation by a raised guard molded into the frame.\n\nThe Glock pistol has a relatively low slide profile, which holds the barrel axis close to the shooter's hand and makes the pistol more comfortable to fire by reducing [[muzzle rise]] and allows for faster aim recovery in rapid firing sequences.\nThe rectangular slide is [[Milling machine|milled]] from a single block of ordnance-grade steel using [[Numerical control|CNC]] machinery.<ref name=\"Kokalis_321\">Kokalis, 321</ref> The barrel and slide undergo two hardening processes prior to treatment with a proprietary [[nitriding]] process called [[Tenifer]]. The Tenifer treatment is applied in a {{convert|500|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} nitrate bath.<ref name=\"Kasler_136\"/> The Tenifer finish is between {{convert|0.04|and|0.05|mm|in|abbr=on|4}} in thickness, and is characterized by extreme resistance to wear and corrosion; it penetrates the metal, and treated parts have similar properties even below the surface to a certain depth.<ref name=\"Kasler_137\">Kasler, 137</ref>\n\nThe Tenifer process produces a matte gray-colored, nonglare surface with a 64 [[Rockwell scale|Rockwell C]] hardness rating and a 99% resistance to salt water corrosion (which meets or exceeds [[stainless steel]] specifications),<ref name=\"Kokalis_321\"/> making the Glock particularly suitable for individuals carrying the pistol [[Concealed carry in the United States|concealed]] as the highly chloride-resistant finish allows the pistol to better endure the effects of perspiration.<ref name=\"Kasler_137\"/> Glock steel parts using the Tenifer treatment are more corrosion resistant than analogous gun parts having other finishes or treatments, including [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]], [[Bluing (steel)|bluing]], [[Chrome plating#industrial chrome|hard chrome plating]], or phosphates.<ref name=\"Kasler_137\"/> During 2010 Glock switched from the salt bath nitriding Tenifer process to a not exactly disclosed [[Ferritic nitrocarburizing#Gaseous ferritic nitrocarburizing|gas nitriding]] process. After applying the nitriding process, a black [[Parkerized]] decorative surface finish is applied. The underlying nitriding treatment will remain, protecting these parts even if the decorative surface finish were to wear off.<ref name=\"MetalTreatments\" />\n\nA current production Glock 17 consists of 34 parts.<ref name=\"us.glock.com\"/> For maintenance, the pistol disassembles into five main groups: the barrel, slide, frame, magazine, and recoil-spring assembly. The firearm is designed for the [[NATO]]-standard 9\u00d719mm Parabellum [[Handgun|pistol]] [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]], but can use high-power (increased pressure) +P ammunition with either full-metal-jacket or jacketed hollow-point projectiles.\n\n=== Barrel ===\n[[File:Glock 17 9mmPara 004.jpg|thumb|upright|Standard sighting arrangement of a \"first-generation\" Glock 17]]\n\nThe hammer-forged barrel has a female type [[polygonal rifling]] with a right-hand twist. The stabilization of the round is not by conventional [[rifling]], using lands and grooves, but rather through a polygonal profile consisting of a series of six or eight interconnected noncircular segments (only the .45 ACP and .45 GAP have octagonal polygonal rifling). Each depressed segment within the interior of the barrel is the equivalent of a groove in a conventional barrel. Thus, the interior of the barrel consists of smooth arcs of steel rather than sharply defined slots.\n\nInstead of using a traditional [[Broaching (metalworking)|broaching machine]] to cut the rifling into the bore, the hammer forging process involves beating a slowly rotating [[mandrel]] through the bore to obtain the [[hexagon]]al or [[octagon]]al shape.<ref name=\"Kasler_138\">Kasler, 138</ref> As a result, the barrel's thickness in the area of each groove is not compromised as with conventional square-cut barrels. This has the advantage of providing a better gas seal behind the projectile as the bore has a slightly smaller diameter, which translates into more efficient use of the combustion gases trapped behind the bullet,<ref name=\"Kasler_138\"/> slightly greater (consistency in) muzzle velocities, and increased accuracy and ease of maintenance.<ref name=\"Barrel History\">{{cite web |url=http://atlantisarms.com/History/Barrel%20History.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420102209/http://atlantisarms.com/History/Barrel%20History.htm |archivedate=April 20, 2010 |title=Barrels |publisher=AtlantisArms.com |date=2004 |accessdate=June 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe newer lines of Glock pistols - i.e. Gen5, G42/43 - are equipped with the ''Glock Marksmanship Barrel'', or GMB. While older barrels were somewhat difficult to identify a bullet as coming from a particular barrel with high enough reliability for evidentiary use, the newer GMB ones are designed differently. A recent study by Stephen Christen and Hans Rudolf Jordi, and published by ''Forensic Science International'' in February 2019, shows that the new GMB barrels leave more identifiably unique markings on the fired projectile. These marks were more easily identified than previous pistol barrel markings, and were sufficient for reliably tying a bullet to a particular barrel. The study used a comparison microscope and an ABIS (Evofinder).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Christen |first1=Stephan |last2=Jordi |first2=Hans Rudolf |title=Individuality testing of new Glock pistol barrels 'Marksman Barrel' |journal=Forensic Science International |date=February 2019 |volume=295 |pages=64\u201371 |doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2018.11.028 |pmid=30572221 }}</ref>\n\n=== Safety ===\nGlock pistols lack a traditional on-off safety lever, which Glock markets as an advantage, especially to police departments, as the user is able to fire immediately without separately manipulating a safety.<ref name=bloom-safety>{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2009-09-09/glock-pistol-used-by-police-raised-safety-issues |title=Glock Pistol Used by Police Raised Safety Issues |last1=Barrett|first1=Paul |last2=Grow|first2=Brian  |website=Bloomberg.com |publisher=Bloomberg Business |accessdate=2016-01-02 |date=2009-09-09}}</ref> Instead, the pistols are designed with three independent safety mechanisms to prevent accidental discharge. The system, designated \"Safe Action\" by Glock, consists of an external [[Trigger safety|integrated trigger safety]] and two automatic internal safeties: a firing pin safety and a drop safety.<ref>{{cite web |title=Safe-action system on Glock.com |url=https://us.glock.com/technology/safe-action |accessdate=2016-08-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623235719/https://us.glock.com/technology/safe-action |archive-date=2016-06-23 |url-status=live }}</ref> The external safety is a small inner lever contained in the trigger. Pressing the lever activates the trigger bar and sheet metal connector. The firing pin safety is a solid hardened steel pin that, in the secured state, blocks the firing pin channel (disabling the firing pin in its longitudinal axis). It is pushed upward to release the firing pin for firing only when the trigger is actuated and the safety is pushed up through the backward movement of the trigger bar. The drop safety guides the trigger bar in a ramp that is released only when direct rearward pressure is applied to the trigger. The three safety mechanisms are automatically disengaged one after the other when the trigger is squeezed, and are automatically reactivated when the trigger is released.<ref name=\"Wo\u017aniak\" /><ref>{{cite web |last=Barrett |first=Paul |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/09_38/b4147038111680.htm |title=Glock Pistol Used by Police Raised Safety Issues |publisher=Businessweek.com |date=2009-09-10 |accessdate=2010-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115022230/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/09_38/b4147038111680.htm |archive-date=2010-01-15 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, Glock announced the Internal Locking System (ILS) safety feature. The ILS is a manually activated lock located in the back of the pistol's grip. It is cylindrical in design and, according to Glock, each key is unique. When activated, the lock causes a tab to protrude from the rear of the grip, giving both a visual and tactile indication as to whether the lock is engaged or not. When activated, the ILS renders the Glock unfireable, as well as making it impossible to disassemble. When disengaged, the ILS adds no further safety mechanisms to the Glock pistol. The ILS is available as an option on most Glock pistols. Glock pistols cannot be retrofitted to accommodate the ILS. The lock must be factory-built in Austria and shipped as a special order.\n\n=== Feeding ===\n[[File:Glock 17 magazine.JPG|thumb|upright|Glock 9\u00d719mm Parabellum 17-round magazine. The numbered witness holes at the back portion visually indicate how many cartridges are contained in the magazine.]]\nThe Glock 17 feeds from staggered-column or double stack [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]]s that have a 17-round capacity (which can be extended to 19 with an optional floor plate) or optional 24 or 33-round [[high-capacity magazine]]s.<ref>[http://www.glock.com/english/index_magazines.htm Glock magazines] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208011649/http://www.glock.com/english/index_magazines.htm |date=December 8, 2010 }}</ref> For jurisdictions which restrict magazine capacity to 10 rounds, Glock offers single-stack, 10-round magazines. The magazines are made of steel and are overmolded with plastic. A steel spring drives a plastic follower. After the last cartridge has been fired, the slide remains open on the slide stop. The slide stop release lever is located on the left side of the frame directly beneath the slide and can be manipulated by the thumb of the right-handed shooter.\n\nGlock magazines are interchangeable between models of the same caliber, meaning that a compact or subcompact pistol will accept magazines designed for the larger pistols chambered for the same round. However, magazines designed for compact and subcompact models will not function in larger pistols because they are not tall enough to reach the slide and magazine release. For example, the subcompact Glock 26 will accept magazines from both the full-size Glock 17 and the compact Glock 19, but the Glock 17 will not accept magazines from the smaller Glock 19 or the Glock 26.  The magazines for the Glock 36, the Glock 42, the Glock 43, and the Glock 44 are all unique; they cannot use magazines intended for another model, nor can their magazines be used in other models.\n\n=== Sights ===\nThe Glock 17 has a fixed polymer combat-type [[iron sight|sighting arrangement]] that consists of a ramped front sight and a notched rear sight with white contrast elements painted on for increased acquisition speed \u2013 a white dot on the front post and a rectangular border on the rear notch. The rear sight can be adjusted for windage (on certain models due to the windage sights not coming as factory default),  as it has a degree of lateral movement in the dovetail it is mounted in. Three other factory rear sight configurations are available in addition to the standard {{convert|6.5|mm|in|adj=on|abbr=on|2}} height sight: a lower impact {{convert|6.1|mm|in|adj=on|abbr=on|2}} sight, and two higher impact versions \u2013 {{convert|6.9|mm|in|abbr=on|2}} and {{convert|7.3|mm|in|abbr=on|2}}.<ref name=\"Kokalis_322\">Kokalis, 322</ref>\n\n=== Accessories ===\n {{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = 220\n   | footer    =\n   | image1    = Glock34 with gtl22.jpg\n   | alt1      =\n   | caption1  = Glock 34 with a GTL 22 attachment featuring a dimmable xenon white light and a red laser\n   | image2    = D150211dv1047.jpg\n   | alt2      =\n   | caption2  = A military diver displaying a Glock 17 fitted with maritime spring cups (not visible in picture, these are part of the internal mechanism)\n   | image3    = GlockOrig.jpg\n   | alt23     =\n   | caption3  = Polymer holster for Glock pistols\n  }}\n\nThe Glock pistol accessories available from the factory include several devices for tactical illumination, such as a series of front rail-mounted \"Glock tactical lights\" featuring a white [[tactical light]] and an optional visible laser sight. An alternate version of the tactical light using an invisible [[infrared]] light and laser sight is available, designed to be used with an infrared [[night vision device]]. Another lighting accessory is an adapter to mount a flashlight onto the bottom of a magazine.\n\nPolymer holsters in various configurations and matching magazine pouches are available. In addition, Glock produces optional triggers, recoil springs, slide stops, magazine release levers, and maritime spring cups. Maritime spring cups are designed to allow the pistol to be fired immediately after being submerged in water. They feature additional openings that allow liquids to flow and escape around them, offering enhanced reliability when water has penetrated into the firing pin assembly channel.\n\nMagazine floor plates (or +2 baseplates), which expand the capacity of the standard magazines by two rounds, are available for models chambered for the 9\u00d719mm Parabellum, .45 GAP, [[.40 S&W]], [[.357 SIG]], and [[.380 ACP]] cartridges. In addition to the standard nonadjustable polymer sight line, three alternative sight lines are offered by Glock. These consist of steel, adjustable, and self-illuminating [[Tritium sights|tritium]] night rear sights and factory steel and self-illuminating tritium contrast pointer steel front sights.\n\n== Variants ==\nFollowing the introduction of the Glock 17, numerous variants and versions have been offered. Variants that differ in caliber, frame, and slide length are identified by different model numbers with the exception of the Glock 17L.\n\nGlock pistols are made in five form factors, all modeled after the original full-sized Glock 17. \"Standard\" models are designed as full-sized duty firearms with a large magazine capacity. \"Compact\" models are slightly smaller with reduced magazine capacity and lighter weight while maintaining a usable grip length. \"[[Subcompact pistols|Subcompact]]\" models are designed for easier carry and being lighter and shorter, are intended to be used with two fingers on the grip below the trigger guard and lack an accessory rail like the larger, after generation two, Glock models. The .45 ACP and [[10mm Auto]] models have bigger, wider slides and are slightly larger than the smaller-chambered pistols and are available in the subcompact models Glock 29 (10 mm) and Glock 30 (.45 ACP). Glock produces five models of single-stack \"Slimline\" subcompact pistols, the Glock 36 in .45 ACP, the Glock 42 in .380 ACP, and the Glock 43, 43x, and 48 in 9\u00d719mm. The 43x and the 48 have longer grips that allow for a full three-finger hold and a 10-round capacity. \"Competition\" versions have longer barrels and slides, adjustable sights, an extended slide and magazine release.\n\nBeginning in 2007, Glock introduced several \"Short Frame\" models designated by the suffix \"SF\". The short frame was originally designed to compete in the now cancelled U.S. military [[Joint Combat Pistol]] trials for a new .45 ACP pistol to replace the [[M9 pistol]]. Glock's entry featured an optional ambidextrous magazine release and [[Picatinny rail|MIL-STD-1913]] rail along with a reduction in the size of the backstrap. The Glock 21SF is currently available in three versions: one with a Picatinny rail and ambidextrous magazine release and two with a Universal Glock rail available with or without the ambidextrous magazine release. Current 10mm and .45 ACP Glock magazines are manufactured with ambidextrous magazine release cutouts. As of January 2009, the Glock 20, 21, 29, and 30 were offered in short-framed variations. These models incorporate a {{convert|2.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} reduction in trigger reach, and full-sized models feature a {{convert|4|mm|in|adj=on|abbr=on}} reduction in heel depth, which corresponds to an overall reduction in length for those models.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gunholstersandmore.com/glock-17-holsters/ |title=Reuters announcement for Glock models |accessdate=2017-04-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170416220902/http://www.gunholstersandmore.com/glock-17-holsters/ |archive-date=2017-04-16 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>[http://www.ibtimes.com/prnews/20080202/ga-glock-30-sf-45.htm \"Glock, Inc.

Several modified versions of the Glock 17 have been introduced:\n** '''Glock 17L''': Introduced in 1988, the 17L incorporates a longer slide and extended barrel. Initially, the Glock 17L had three holes in the top of the barrel and a corresponding slot in the slide; however, later production pistols lack the holes in the barrel. The Glock 17L is manufactured in limited quantities.\n** '''Glock 17C''': Introduced in 1996, the 17C incorporates slots cut in the barrel and slide to [[Muzzle brake|compensate for recoil]]. Many other Glock pistols now come with this option, all with a \"C\" suffix on the slide.\n** '''Glock 17MB''': The 17MB is a version with ambidextrous magazine catch. This model, along with the other MB variants, was no longer available upon the introduction of the fourth-generation models, which have a reversible magazine catch.\n** '''Glock 17M''': Introduced in 2016, the 17M was created in response to an FBI solicitation for a new 9mm pistol. Differences from the Generation 4 model include removal of the finger grooves, ambidextrous slide lock, rounded slide nose profile, flared magazine well with new magazine baseplates, and a tougher finish on metal components. The Glock 17M also abandons the polygonal rifling of previous models for conventional rifling.<ref>{{Cite web |author=Handgun Planet (staff) |date=March 30, 2017 |title=Glock 17M: The 'Inside' Scoop (Photo Documentary) |url=https://handgunplanet.com/review/glock-17m-the-inside-scoop-photo-documentary/ |publisher=Handgun Planet |access-date=July 30, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180711064050/https://handgunplanet.com/review/glock-17m-the-inside-scoop-photo-documentary/ |archive-date=July 11, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> {{as of|2017}}, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], the [[South Carolina Highway Patrol]] and the [[Ontario Provincial Police]]<ref name=\"glock.com\">{{cite press release |title=Ontario Provincial Police Replaces its Current Pistols with GLOCK Pistols |url=https://us.glock.com/press%20release/pages/ontario%20provincial%20police%20replaces%20its%20current%20pistols%20with%20glock%20pistols |date=June 12, 2017 |publisher=U.S. Headquarters, GLOCK |access-date=July 30, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180730080551/https://us.glock.com/press%20release/pages/ontario%20provincial%20police%20replaces%20its%20current%20pistols%20with%20glock%20pistols |archive-date=July 30, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> have adopted the pistol as standard.\n\n[[File:MarineCorpsGlock18.jpg|thumb|The Glock 18, chambered in 9\u00d719mm Parabellum, fitted with a detachable shoulder stock and being fired in fully automatic mode]]\n[[File:Glock 18C.jpg|thumb|Glock 18C (compensated) in the third generation, unloaded and equipped with 19-rounds magazine, fire selector set to single fire]]\n\n* '''Glock 18''': The Glock 18{{Anchor|Glock 18}} is a [[selective fire|selective-fire]] variant of the Glock 17, developed at the request of the Austrian [[counter-terrorism|counter-terrorist]] unit [[EKO Cobra]], and as a way to internally test Glock components under high strain conditions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2017/08/17/tfb-tv-glock-18-machine-pistol-mini-documentary/ |title=TFB TV Glock 18 Machine Pistol Mini-Documentary |publisher=The Firearm Blog |date=17 August 2017 |access-date=11 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012043620/http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2017/08/17/tfb-tv-glock-18-machine-pistol-mini-documentary/ |archive-date=12 October 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Originally produced in 1986, this [[machine pistol]]\u2013class firearm has a lever-type fire-control selector switch, installed on the serrated portion of the rear left side of the slide. With the selector lever in the bottom position, the pistol fires [[Automatic firearm|fully automatically]], and with the selector lever in the top position, the pistol fires semi-automatically. The firearm is typically used with an extended 33-round-capacity magazine, although other magazines from the Glock 17 can be used, with available capacities of 10, 17, 19 or 24 rounds. Unlike all its other pistols, Glock is highly secretive about Glock 18 models, not including them on its official websites or its public catalogues,<ref name=\"guns.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.guns.com/2017/08/07/glock-18-the-machine-pistol/|title=Hands-on with Glock 18: The elusive machine pistol (VIDEO)|date=7 August 2017|publisher=Guns.com|access-date=11 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011232935/http://www.guns.com/2017/08/07/glock-18-the-machine-pistol/|archive-date=11 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> and because of the pistol's nature, it is only offered to military, law enforcement, and government organizations,<ref name=\"guns.com\"/> and its production details are highly classified. Early Glock 18 models were ported to reduce [[muzzle rise]] during automatic fire. A very early design introduced a longer ported barrel which was soon discarded as it would not fit in a holster. Another compensated variant was produced, known as the Glock 18C. It has a keyhole opening cut into the forward portion of the slide, similar to the opening on the Glock long-slide models, although the Glock 18 has a standard-length slide. The keyhole opening provides an area to allow the four, progressively larger (from back to front) compensator cuts machined into the barrel to vent the propellant gases upwards, affording more control over the rapid-firing machine pistol.\n** '''Glock 18C''': The compensator cuts start about halfway back on the top of the barrel. The two rear cuts are narrower than the two front cuts. The slide is hollowed, or dished-out, in a rectangular pattern between the rear of the ejection port and the rear sight. The rate of fire in fully automatic mode is around 1,100\u20131,200 rounds per minute. Most of the other characteristics are equivalent to the Glock 17, although the slide, frame, and certain fire-control parts of the Glock 18 are not interchangeable with other Glock models.<ref>[http://www.janes.com/extracts/extract/jiw/jiw_0006.html Janes.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213084320/http://www.janes.com/extracts/extract/jiw/jiw_0006.html |date=February 13, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cybershooters.org/?page_id=528 |title=Glock 18 interchangeability with Glock 17 |publisher=Cybershooters.org |accessdate=2009-07-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622091944/https://www.cybershooters.org/?page_id=528 |archive-date=2015-06-22 |url-status=live }}</ref>[[File:GLOCK 19.JPG|thumb|The compact Glock 19 in 9\u00d719mm Parabellum]]\n* '''Glock 19''': The Glock 19 {{Anchor|Glock 19}} is effectively a reduced-size Glock 17, called the \"Compact\" by the manufacturer. It was first produced in 1988, primarily for military and law enforcement. The Glock 19's barrel and pistol grip are shorter by about {{convert|12|mm|in|abbr=on|1}} than the Glock 17, and it uses a magazine with a standard capacity of 15 rounds. The pistol is compatible with factory magazines from the Glock 17 and Glock 18, giving the Glock 19 available capacities of: 17 rounds (standard magazine with +2 extension), 10, 17, and 19 (standard Glock 17 magazine with +2), 24 and 26 (standard magazine with +2 extension) and the 31 (standard Glock 18 magazine with +2 removed) and 33 rounds of the Glock 18. To preserve the operational reliability of the short recoil system, the mass of the slide remains the same as in the Glock 17 from which it is derived. With the exception of the slide, frame, barrel, locking block, recoil spring, guide rod, and slide lock spring, all of the other components are interchangeable between the models 17 and 19.

It features a Glock 19 slide with a Glock 17 frame in coyote color instead of the regular black color the Glock usually comes in. The frame includes a lanyard loop and a front lip in the magazine which purpose is to make changing magazines with gloves on easier, but this means the new Gen 5 17-round magazines cannot be used in the Glock 19X because the front lip will block the extended magazine floor plates from locking into the 19X's magazine well.

It features a smaller frame compared to the Glock 19, with a pistol grip that supports only two fingers, a shorter barrel and slide, and a double-stack magazine with a standard capacity of 10 rounds. A factory magazine with a +2 extension gives a capacity of 12 rounds. In addition, factory magazines from the Glock 17, Glock 18, and Glock 19, with capacities of 15, 17, 19, 24, 31 and 33 rounds, will function in the Glock 26. More than simply a \"shortened\" Glock 19, design of the subcompact Glock 26 required extensive rework of the frame, locking block, and spring assembly that features a dual recoil spring.\n* '''Glock 34''': The Glock 34 {{Anchor|Glock 34}} is a competition version of the Glock 17. It is similar to its predecessor, the Glock 17L, but with a slightly shorter slide and barrel, to meet the maximum size requirements for many sanctioned action pistol sporting events. It was developed and produced in 1998, and compared to the Glock 17, features a {{convert|21|mm|abbr=on|1}} longer barrel and slide. It has an extended magazine release, extended slide stop lever, {{convert|20|N|lb-f|1|lk=on|abbr=on}} trigger pull, and an adjustable rear sight. The sides at the front of the slide are slanted instead of squared. Further, the top of the slide and parts of its inside are milled out, creating a conspicuous hole at the top designed to reduce front-end muzzle weight to better balance the pistol and reduce the overall weight of the slide.<ref>{{cite news |last=Ayoob |first=Massad |url=http://www.themodernsurvivalist.com/archives/81 |title=The Glock 34 |work=[[Guns (magazine)|Guns]] |date=September 1999 |publisher=The Modern Survivalist |access-date=March 1, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301182714/http://www.themodernsurvivalist.com/archives/81 |archive-date=March 1, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* '''Glock 43''': The Glock 43{{Anchor|Glock 43}} is a \"slimline\" version of the subcompact Glock 26 that features an ultracompact slide and frame.

The Glock 36 is the first Glock pistol to be manufactured with a single-stack magazine, having a standard capacity of six rounds and being unique to the model. The Glock 36 cannot use factory magazines from its larger relatives due to its single-stack magazine design.\n* '''Glock 41''': The Glock 41 {{Anchor|Glock 41}} is a competition version of the Glock 21, much like what the G34 is in relation to the G17; it features a 5.3-inch barrel and an elongated slide.

The pistol uses a modified slide, frame, and barrel to account for the differences in size and power of the .40 S&W cartridge. The standard magazine capacity is 15 rounds. The Glock Model 22 is favored and used by multiple law enforcement agencies around the world, including the [[Baltimore Police Department]], [[Los Angeles Police Department]], [[Miami Police Department]], [[Maryland State Police]], [[Overland Park Police Department]], [[Kansas City Police Department]], [[Missouri State Highway Patrol]], and [[Alaska State Troopers]] in the United States; the [[New South Wales Police Force#Firearms|NSW Police Force]] and [[Queensland Police Service#Equipment|Queensland Police Service]] in Australia; the [[Edmonton Police Service]], [[Calgary Police Service]], [[Alberta Sheriffs Branch]], [[Toronto Police Service]], [[Ottawa Police Service]], and [[British Columbia Sheriff Service]] in Canada; and the [[National Bureau of Investigation (Philippines)]], among others.\n* '''Glock 23''': The Glock 23 {{Anchor|Glock 23}} is a .40 S&W version of the compact Glock 19. It is dimensionally identical to the Glock 19, but is slightly heavier and uses a modified slide, frame, .40 S&W barrel, and a standard magazine capacity of 13 rounds.

The factory magazines from the larger Glock 22 and 23 will function in the Glock 27, increasing capacity to 13 or 15 rounds.  Spacers are available that fit on these larger-capacity magazines themselves; they have the effect of \"extending\" the magazine well of the pistol, thereby improving the ergonomic feel of the pistol when the longer magazines are inserted.\n* '''Glock 35''': The Glock 35 {{Anchor|Glock 35}} is a .40 S&W version of the competition Glock 34. The Glock Model 35 was the service pistol for the [[Kentucky State Police]], but by the summer of 2017, they had reverted from the Glock 35 back to 9mm weapons because of improvements in 9mm bullets, making them superior to the Glock 35's .40 ammunition in performance and economy as measured in the standard \"FBI Protocol\" tests.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.klemagazine.com/home/2017/7/25/better-bullets|title=Better Bullets|last=Moore|first=Michael|date=July 2017|website=Kentucky Law Enforcement Magazine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181027061606/https://www.klemagazine.com/home/2017/7/25/better-bullets|archive-date=2018-10-27|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAs is typical of pistols chambered in .40 S&W, each of the standard Glock models (22, 23, and 27) may be easily converted to the corresponding [[.357 SIG]] chambering (Glock 31, 32, and 33, respectively) simply by replacing the barrel.

It operates via [[Blowback (arms)|straight blowback]] of the slide. This required modification of the locking surfaces on the barrel, as well as a redesign of the former locking block.  Unusual for a blowback design, the barrel is not fixed to the frame.  It moves rearward in recoil until it is tilted below the slide, similar to the standard locked-breech system.  The reduced size and mass of the Glock 42 required return to the Glock-standard locked-breech design.\n* '''Glock 25''': The Glock 25 {{Anchor|Glock 25}}, introduced in 1995, is a blowback derivative of the compact ({{convert|102|mm|abbr=on|1}} barrel) Glock 19.

The standard magazine capacity is 10 rounds, but the 15-round Glock 25 magazine will function in the Glock 28.  Standard fixed-sight elevation is 6.9&nbsp;mm, unlike the 6.5&nbsp;mm elevation used for the 9\u00d719mm Parabellum models.\n* '''Glock 42''': The Glock 42 {{Anchor|Glock 42}}, introduced in 2014, is an all-new locked-breech \"slimline\" ({{convert|83|mm|abbr=on|1}} barrel) design. The single-stack magazine is unique to this model, with a capacity of six rounds.

It uses a wider, beveled slide, larger barrel, and different magazine, but is otherwise similar to the Glock 17. The Glock 37 first appeared in 2003. It was designed to offer ballistic performance comparable with the .45 ACP in the frame size of the Glock 17. The concern with the size of the Glock 20/21 has been addressed by the Glock 36, 21SF, and 30SF, all of which featured reduced-size frames.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.
