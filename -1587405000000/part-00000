The book was originally published in the Spanish language in 2002 before being translated into English in 2017. The book follows an unnamed narrator as he struggles with gender identity, personal identity, and the ideas of sanity, desire, fear, and freedom. It focuses on the unnamed narrator as he deals with three women who tell him he is a woman, but he attempts to debunk this idea. The novel has been met with positive reception by reviewers.\n\n== Plot ==\n\nThe novel opens to an unnamed man reflecting on why he let a woman into his house on a dark and stormy night. The woman introduces herself as [[Amparo D\u00e1vila]], and the narrator takes particular interest in her prominent hip bone, though he cannot remember this bone's name. Amparo approaches the narrator and claims that he used to be a tree, which greatly confuses him. Later that night, the narrator reveals that he was actually waiting for a different woman, who he refers to as the Betrayed; they were planning to end their relationship for good that night. The Betrayed shows up late and faints immediately upon arrival. Amparo begins to care for her and unpacks the Betrayed's possessions, saying that she will need to stay there for her recovery.\n\nAfter a few days at the narrator's house, the narrator notices that Amparo is writing something, which she says is about her own disappearance. He begins to observe the two women and comes to the conclusion that they have created their own language structured around the word \"glu.\" Amparo eventually asks him about his work at Serenity Shores Sanatorium, increasing his suspicions. One night, he decides to drug her in order to try to get answers out of her. She reveals that she is looking for information on a man who could have stolen a manuscript for her. The narrator recalls that the man tried to organize the terminally ill patients to demand death rather than life at the hospital, and he eventually committed suicide. Amparo says that she has not truly written since the day the man stole her manuscript. The narrator later goes to work and makes a deal with two women that he will give them a ride on a later night in exchange for permission to search through the records. He finds the man's files, which name him Juan Escutia. The narrator also stumbles upon Amparo's lost manuscript in the archives but does not reveal this to Amparo.\n\nLater, Amparo approaches the narrator and tells him that she knows his secret: he is actually a woman. The narrator's paranoia and uncertainty about his own body and existence grow after this conversation, and he begins to constantly verify that he is a man.\n\nThe narrator follows through on his promise to give the two women in charge of the archives a ride. He accompanies them to a party and has sex with them. After leaving the party, he has the idea to look up Amparo in a phone book. He wants contact the real Amparo and expose the false Amparo. He later calls her, and she agrees to meet with him. When he arrives at the true Amparo's house, he gains some memories of his life as a tree. After recovering from this experience, he begins to speak with Amparo, who he calls the True One. He hands her the manuscript and describes the False One to her, and she claims that the False One must be one of the Emissaries. She gives him the manuscript back and tells him to give it to the False One, which he has no intention of doing.\n\nOne morning, a hospital security guard arrives at the narrator's house. The narrator is taken to the office of the Director, who confronts him about his illegal trips to the archives. To his own confusion, the narrator confesses to this transgression and is taken to the infirmary. He is released and returns home after being questioned. He later begins to spy on himself and on others and notices that people do not fit into his expectations of them. The female workers and patients do not fit into his ideas of femininity. He continues to investigate Juan Escutia, and the Director catches him searching through the files again. The Director then confronts him about his guests, which are unacceptable by the hospital's standards. The narrator explains some of the circumstances of the arrival of the women and asks the Director if he wants to meet them. The Director accepts this invitation. When he arrives, the narrator is shocked to learn that the Director knows the \u201cglu\u201d language. He begins to converse with the women in this language, leaving the narrator confused.\n\nThe True One calls the narrator and tells him to come over, addressing him as a woman. The next morning, the False One breaks down and claims that without True Amparo's writing, her work is useless. She acknowledges that she is not the real Amparo, but she says that the one who the narrator calls the True One is also false. The narrator decides to visit the True One, who seems to have forgotten inviting him. The True One asks why it even matters if she is the real Amparo and claims that she does not know whether she is or not. She then confuses the narrator by saying that \"he\" will kill himself without specifying who \"he\" is, and she claims that she is \u201cthe only one left.\u201d The narrator then realizes that he is before the Disappearance. He remembers reading her manuscript but has no memories of its contents. He runs outside to his jeep, which has disappeared along with Amparo's manuscript. He then goes to walk along the coast before eventually being discovered by the Betrayed. She says something in the mysterious language, and the narrator understands her and responds.\n\nThe narrator ends up in the hospital and is released. Upon returning home, the False One greets him and tells him that they are the only ones left. The narrator goes down to the beach with False Amparo and she utters the same expression about \"him\" killing himself, and a pelican inexplicably commits suicide. False Amparo gets up to leave and encourages the narrator to accompany her, but he refuses.\n\nLater, the narrator can no longer remember the False One's face, but he does remember the name of her hip bone: the [[Ilium (bone)|Ilium]]. He thinks that the Emissaries should have realized that this is the best way to discover the sex of a person in order to discover his secret.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n*'''The Narrator''' - The unnamed narrator is a doctor at Serenity Shores Sanatorium and lives in employee housing on the oceanside. The narrator self-identifies as a male. According to Amparo D\u00e1vila he was a tree in a past life, which he can vaguely recall at various moments in the work. He is an older man, though still thin and toned, with gray hair, wrinkles, and green eyes.  He describes himself as having problematic past relationships with women whom he either left quickly or quickly forgot about; he struggles between feelings of fear and feelings of desire in his interactions with women. The Betrayed and the Betrayer are two of his ex-lovers, and he had relations with a man (referred to as \"Someone\") in the early years of his adolescence. The narrator also has sexual relations with the Magpies. At the end of the novel he confesses to a secret, but the reader is not informed what the secret is.\n*'''Amparo D\u00e1vila, the False One -''' Amparo has a catlike face with enormous eyes, finely arched eyebrows, high cheekbones, a wild mane of hair, and prominent hip bones, and she appears not much older than twenty-five. She incites feelings of fear in the narrator, although he initially confuses these feelings with desire. She is a feminist who seeks to preserve the words of the real Amparo D\u00e1vila, and she has found the narrator in hopes of obtaining a manuscript from the record of Juan Escutia at the hospital.  She informs the narrator that she knows he is a woman and claims to have known him from the days when he was a tree. She acts as if she is the real Amparo D\u00e1vila and becomes upset when she learns the narrator has spoken with the True One. Every day, she wakes up, takes a shower, and makes breakfast. She sleeps in the same room as the Betrayed and cares for the Betrayed during her illness. Amparo and the Betrayed share a secret language. \n*'''The Betrayed -''' The Betrayed is the narrator's ex-lover whose visit he expects on the night Amparo D\u00e1vila arrives at his doorstep. For a large amount of the first half of the book, the Betrayed is ill and Amparo is caring for her. The Betrayed and Amparo develop a secret language and grow close during the time they are staying in the narrator's house. The narrator can not get over the Betrayed. Their relationship began by only meeting on Thursdays, eventually changing into seeing each other every day, which lead to the narrator cheating with the Betrayer. Eventually, they mend their relationship, but the narrator fears he will betray her again; subsequently, he moves to the coast to start his job at the sanatorium without telling the Betrayed he has left. The Betrayed has some form of relationship with the General Director. \n*'''Juan Escutia -''' Juan is a former patient of the Serenity Shores Sanatorium from the first few years of the narrator's tenure there; he was also called the Impetuous Man and the new/modern Prometheus because he incited protests among the terminally ill patients and encouraged them to rise up against the doctors.  Before his time in various facilities, Juan lived in South City and was primarily a journalist. Juan was described as being muscular with brown eyes and a scruffy beard. One day, he used a mallet to smash a window at the sanatorium and killed himself by jumping out of the window. \n*'''Amparo D\u00e1vila, the True One -''' The narrator refers to this Amparo as the True One. He meets with her to exchange the manuscript, hoping to gain answers about the False Amparo. Instead, the meeting with the True Amparo causes him to recall more memories of his time as a tree, and the strangeness surrounding his meetings with the True Amparo causes his sanity to unravel as the novel progresses. She is described as looking approximately the same as the False Amparo, albeit older. She informs the narrator about the emissaries, including the False Amparo. \n*'''The Director''' - He is the General Director at the Serenity Shores Sanatorium who is forced to investigate the narrator after the narrator is found to be reading past records that he is not allowed access to and harboring women in his home. The General Director drinks nice whiskey\u2014according to the narrator's tastebuds\u2014and smokes cigars. He visits the narrator's house and speaks the secret language of the two women, and he has some sort of relationship with the Betrayed as she visits him at the hospital every day. \n*'''The Betrayer -''' The Betrayer is an ex-lover of the narrator whom he still desires. She flirts with him flippantly one day when they meet in a coffee shop, and they share a kiss that consumes the narrator with a passion that lasts for three years. She threatens the narrator, throws plates at him, cries excessively, and argues endlessly. She leaves the narrator in search of something new, whereupon he realizes he dedicated all his energy, time, and space to her.\n*'''The Magpies -''' The Magpies are two women who work with the narrator, although in the records department. He agrees to drive them to a party in return for access to the records, especially those of Juan Escutia. They live in one of the hospital-assigned apartments. They wear garish makeup and outdated glasses. On the night they meet with the narrator, they wear dressy clothes as they are going to their nephew's wedding. The narrator fantasizes about them in the car, and they ultimately engage in a threesome at the end of the evening.\n\n== Development ==\n[[File:TaigaCCM10 (cropped).JPG|thumb|[[Cristina Rivera Garza]], the author of ''The Iliac Crest.'']]\n[[Cristina Rivera Garza]] is currently a professor of writing at the [[University of California, San Diego|University of California at San Diego]], and she received her PhD from the [[University of Houston]].<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://literature.ucsd.edu/people/faculty/criveragarza.html|title=Cristina Rivera-Garza|website=literature.ucsd.edu|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> Rivera Garza stated in an interview that she spent years analyzing the files of a large insane asylum in preparation for her earlier novel ''No One Will See Me Cry'', and this studying lead to her use of language to show the dichotomy between insanity and sanity demonstrated in ''The Iliac Crest''.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://themillions.com/2017/10/writing-bound-to-bodies-samantha-hunt-in-conversation-with-cristina-rivera-garza.html|title=Writing Bound to Bodies: Cristina Rivera Garza in Conversation with Samantha Hunt|date=2017-10-30|website=The Millions|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> She said that a major reason for writing the novel was to explore and question the boundaries and categories into which humans divide themselves.<ref name=\":3\" /> Rivera Garza stated in another interview that \"writing should attempt to cross borders of genre and language while also highlighting the politics of borders between cities, genders, and definitions of sanity.\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://brooklynrail.org/2017/12/books/Cristina-Rivera-Garzas-The-Iliac-Crest|title=Cristina Rivera Garza\u2019s The Iliac Crest|last=Garrett|first=Yvonne C.|date=2017-12-13|website=The Brooklyn Rail|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> In ''The Iliac Crest,'' Rivera Garza goes beyond whether someone is a man or a woman and instead focuses on how gender can be determined and why it's important.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://lithub.com/the-queering-of-boundaries-in-cristina-rivera-garzas-fiction/|title=The Queering of Boundaries in Cristina Rivera Garza\u2019s Fiction|date=2018-11-08|website=Literary  Hub|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\nA unique feature of ''The Iliac Crest'' is its inclusion of [[Amparo D\u00e1vila]], a real life writer.

The book was originally published in the Spanish language in 2002 before being translated into English in 2017. The book follows an unnamed narrator as he struggles with gender identity, personal identity, and the ideas of sanity, desire, fear, and freedom. It focuses on the unnamed narrator as he deals with three women who tell him he is a woman, but he attempts to debunk this idea. The novel has been met with positive reception by reviewers.\n\n== Plot ==\n\nThe novel opens to an unnamed man reflecting on why he let a woman into his house on a dark and stormy night. The woman introduces herself as [[Amparo D\u00e1vila]], and the narrator takes particular interest in her prominent hip bone, though he cannot remember this bone's name. Amparo approaches the narrator and claims that he used to be a tree, which greatly confuses him. Later that night, the narrator reveals that he was actually waiting for a different woman, who he refers to as the Betrayed; they were planning to end their relationship for good that night. The Betrayed shows up late and faints immediately upon arrival. Amparo begins to care for her and unpacks the Betrayed's possessions, saying that she will need to stay there for her recovery.\n\nAfter a few days at the narrator's house, the narrator notices that Amparo is writing something, which she says is about her own disappearance. He begins to observe the two women and comes to the conclusion that they have created their own language structured around the word \"glu.\" Amparo eventually asks him about his work at Serenity Shores Sanatorium, increasing his suspicions. One night, he decides to drug her in order to try to get answers out of her. She reveals that she is looking for information on a man who could have stolen a manuscript for her. The narrator recalls that the man tried to organize the terminally ill patients to demand death rather than life at the hospital, and he eventually committed suicide. Amparo says that she has not truly written since the day the man stole her manuscript. The narrator later goes to work and makes a deal with two women that he will give them a ride on a later night in exchange for permission to search through the records. He finds the man's files, which name him Juan Escutia. The narrator also stumbles upon Amparo's lost manuscript in the archives but does not reveal this to Amparo.\n\nLater, Amparo approaches the narrator and tells him that she knows his secret: he is actually a woman. The narrator's paranoia and uncertainty about his own body and existence grow after this conversation, and he begins to constantly verify that he is a man.\n\nThe narrator follows through on his promise to give the two women in charge of the archives a ride. He accompanies them to a party and has sex with them. After leaving the party, he has the idea to look up Amparo in a phone book. He wants contact the real Amparo and expose the false Amparo. He later calls her, and she agrees to meet with him. When he arrives at the true Amparo's house, he gains some memories of his life as a tree. After recovering from this experience, he begins to speak with Amparo, who he calls the True One. He hands her the manuscript and describes the False One to her, and she claims that the False One must be one of the Emissaries. She gives him the manuscript back and tells him to give it to the False One, which he has no intention of doing.\n\nOne morning, a hospital security guard arrives at the narrator's house. The narrator is taken to the office of the Director, who confronts him about his illegal trips to the archives. To his own confusion, the narrator confesses to this transgression and is taken to the infirmary. He is released and returns home after being questioned. He later begins to spy on himself and on others and notices that people do not fit into his expectations of them. The female workers and patients do not fit into his ideas of femininity. He continues to investigate Juan Escutia, and the Director catches him searching through the files again. The Director then confronts him about his guests, which are unacceptable by the hospital's standards. The narrator explains some of the circumstances of the arrival of the women and asks the Director if he wants to meet them. The Director accepts this invitation. When he arrives, the narrator is shocked to learn that the Director knows the \u201cglu\u201d language. He begins to converse with the women in this language, leaving the narrator confused.\n\nThe True One calls the narrator and tells him to come over, addressing him as a woman. The next morning, the False One breaks down and claims that without True Amparo's writing, her work is useless. She acknowledges that she is not the real Amparo, but she says that the one who the narrator calls the True One is also false. The narrator decides to visit the True One, who seems to have forgotten inviting him. The True One asks why it even matters if she is the real Amparo and claims that she does not know whether she is or not. She then confuses the narrator by saying that \"he\" will kill himself without specifying who \"he\" is, and she claims that she is \u201cthe only one left.\u201d The narrator then realizes that he is before the Disappearance. He remembers reading her manuscript but has no memories of its contents. He runs outside to his jeep, which has disappeared along with Amparo's manuscript. He then goes to walk along the coast before eventually being discovered by the Betrayed. She says something in the mysterious language, and the narrator understands her and responds.\n\nThe narrator ends up in the hospital and is released. Upon returning home, the False One greets him and tells him that they are the only ones left. The narrator goes down to the beach with False Amparo and she utters the same expression about \"him\" killing himself, and a pelican inexplicably commits suicide. False Amparo gets up to leave and encourages the narrator to accompany her, but he refuses.\n\nLater, the narrator can no longer remember the False One's face, but he does remember the name of her hip bone: the [[Ilium (bone)|Ilium]]. He thinks that the Emissaries should have realized that this is the best way to discover the sex of a person in order to discover his secret.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n*'''The Narrator''' - The unnamed narrator is a doctor at Serenity Shores Sanatorium and lives in employee housing on the oceanside. The narrator self-identifies as a male. According to Amparo D\u00e1vila he was a tree in a past life, which he can vaguely recall at various moments in the work. He is an older man, though still thin and toned, with gray hair, wrinkles, and green eyes.  He describes himself as having problematic past relationships with women whom he either left quickly or quickly forgot about; he struggles between feelings of fear and feelings of desire in his interactions with women. The Betrayed and the Betrayer are two of his ex-lovers, and he had relations with a man (referred to as \"Someone\") in the early years of his adolescence. The narrator also has sexual relations with the Magpies. At the end of the novel he confesses to a secret, but the reader is not informed what the secret is.\n*'''Amparo D\u00e1vila, the False One -''' Amparo has a catlike face with enormous eyes, finely arched eyebrows, high cheekbones, a wild mane of hair, and prominent hip bones, and she appears not much older than twenty-five. She incites feelings of fear in the narrator, although he initially confuses these feelings with desire. She is a feminist who seeks to preserve the words of the real Amparo D\u00e1vila, and she has found the narrator in hopes of obtaining a manuscript from the record of Juan Escutia at the hospital.  She informs the narrator that she knows he is a woman and claims to have known him from the days when he was a tree. She acts as if she is the real Amparo D\u00e1vila and becomes upset when she learns the narrator has spoken with the True One. Every day, she wakes up, takes a shower, and makes breakfast. She sleeps in the same room as the Betrayed and cares for the Betrayed during her illness. Amparo and the Betrayed share a secret language. \n*'''The Betrayed -''' The Betrayed is the narrator's ex-lover whose visit he expects on the night Amparo D\u00e1vila arrives at his doorstep. For a large amount of the first half of the book, the Betrayed is ill and Amparo is caring for her. The Betrayed and Amparo develop a secret language and grow close during the time they are staying in the narrator's house. The narrator can not get over the Betrayed. Their relationship began by only meeting on Thursdays, eventually changing into seeing each other every day, which lead to the narrator cheating with the Betrayer. Eventually, they mend their relationship, but the narrator fears he will betray her again; subsequently, he moves to the coast to start his job at the sanatorium without telling the Betrayed he has left. The Betrayed has some form of relationship with the General Director. \n*'''Juan Escutia -''' Juan is a former patient of the Serenity Shores Sanatorium from the first few years of the narrator's tenure there; he was also called the Impetuous Man and the new/modern Prometheus because he incited protests among the terminally ill patients and encouraged them to rise up against the doctors.  Before his time in various facilities, Juan lived in South City and was primarily a journalist. Juan was described as being muscular with brown eyes and a scruffy beard. One day, he used a mallet to smash a window at the sanatorium and killed himself by jumping out of the window. \n*'''Amparo D\u00e1vila, the True One -''' The narrator refers to this Amparo as the True One. He meets with her to exchange the manuscript, hoping to gain answers about the False Amparo. Instead, the meeting with the True Amparo causes him to recall more memories of his time as a tree, and the strangeness surrounding his meetings with the True Amparo causes his sanity to unravel as the novel progresses. She is described as looking approximately the same as the False Amparo, albeit older. She informs the narrator about the emissaries, including the False Amparo. \n*'''The Director''' - He is the General Director at the Serenity Shores Sanatorium who is forced to investigate the narrator after the narrator is found to be reading past records that he is not allowed access to and harboring women in his home. The General Director drinks nice whiskey\u2014according to the narrator's tastebuds\u2014and smokes cigars. He visits the narrator's house and speaks the secret language of the two women, and he has some sort of relationship with the Betrayed as she visits him at the hospital every day. \n*'''The Betrayer -''' The Betrayer is an ex-lover of the narrator whom he still desires. She flirts with him flippantly one day when they meet in a coffee shop, and they share a kiss that consumes the narrator with a passion that lasts for three years. She threatens the narrator, throws plates at him, cries excessively, and argues endlessly. She leaves the narrator in search of something new, whereupon he realizes he dedicated all his energy, time, and space to her.\n*'''The Magpies -''' The Magpies are two women who work with the narrator, although in the records department. He agrees to drive them to a party in return for access to the records, especially those of Juan Escutia. They live in one of the hospital-assigned apartments. They wear garish makeup and outdated glasses. On the night they meet with the narrator, they wear dressy clothes as they are going to their nephew's wedding. The narrator fantasizes about them in the car, and they ultimately engage in a threesome at the end of the evening.\n\n== Development ==\n[[File:TaigaCCM10 (cropped).JPG|thumb|[[Cristina Rivera Garza]], the author of ''The Iliac Crest.'']]\n[[Cristina Rivera Garza]] is currently a professor of writing at the [[University of California, San Diego|University of California at San Diego]], and she received her PhD from the [[University of Houston]].<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://literature.ucsd.edu/people/faculty/criveragarza.html|title=Cristina Rivera-Garza|website=literature.ucsd.edu|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> Rivera Garza stated in an interview that she spent years analyzing the files of a large insane asylum in preparation for her earlier novel ''No One Will See Me Cry'', and this studying lead to her use of language to show the dichotomy between insanity and sanity demonstrated in ''The Iliac Crest''.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://themillions.com/2017/10/writing-bound-to-bodies-samantha-hunt-in-conversation-with-cristina-rivera-garza.html|title=Writing Bound to Bodies: Cristina Rivera Garza in Conversation with Samantha Hunt|date=2017-10-30|website=The Millions|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> She said that a major reason for writing the novel was to explore and question the boundaries and categories into which humans divide themselves.<ref name=\":3\" /> Rivera Garza stated in another interview that \"writing should attempt to cross borders of genre and language while also highlighting the politics of borders between cities, genders, and definitions of sanity.\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://brooklynrail.org/2017/12/books/Cristina-Rivera-Garzas-The-Iliac-Crest|title=Cristina Rivera Garza\u2019s The Iliac Crest|last=Garrett|first=Yvonne C.|date=2017-12-13|website=The Brooklyn Rail|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> In ''The Iliac Crest,'' Rivera Garza goes beyond whether someone is a man or a woman and instead focuses on how gender can be determined and why it's important.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://lithub.com/the-queering-of-boundaries-in-cristina-rivera-garzas-fiction/|title=The Queering of Boundaries in Cristina Rivera Garza\u2019s Fiction|date=2018-11-08|website=Literary  Hub|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\nA unique feature of ''The Iliac Crest'' is its inclusion of [[Amparo D\u00e1vila]], a real life writer.

Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]].

Watertightness of connections, ports and hatches are key to staying afloat. [[Metacentric height|Stability]]\u2014the ability to return to an upright condition when upset by waves is another key aspect.\n* ''Performance'' hinges on a number of factors, including the waterline length (longer means faster), drag in the water (narrower hull with smooth appendages), hull shape, and sail shape and area.\n* ''Sea kindliness'' is an indicator of steering ease, directional stability and quelling of motion induced by wind and waves.\n\nThe displacement of a monohull cruising sailboat affects the above factors, as follows:<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n* ''Heavy displacement'' yachts with a displacement to length (D/L) ratio of 400+ have a long, deep keel and a protected propellor. They are stable, often roomy, are resistant to harm from groundings and floating obstacles, and have good sea kindliness, but lack speed.\n* ''Medium displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 300 typically have a separate keel and blended rudder support, which improves speed and maneuverability over the heavy displacement designs.\n* ''Light displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 200 typically have a fin keel and a spade rudder with a ballasted bulb. They have good speed, maneuverability, and ability to point into the wind. Their sea kindliness is less than the heavy and medium-displacement categories.\n\nMultihulls offer tradeoffs as cruising sailboats, compared with [[Monohull|monohulls]]. They may be catamarans or trimarans. They rely on form stability\u2014having separate hulls far apart\u2014for their resistance to capsize.<ref name=\":6\" /> Their advantages include greater: stability, speed, (for catamarans) living space, and shallower draft. Their drawbacks include: greater expenses, greater [[windage]], more difficult tacking under sail, less load capacity, and more maneuvering room required because of their broad beam. They come with a variety of sleeping accommodations and (for catamarans) bridge-deck configurations. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Tarjan, Gregor.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/233534126|title=Catamarans : the complete guide for cruising sailors|date=2008|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-159622-0|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=233534126}}</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\nTraditionally, all sailing yachts were made of wood, using a wooden keel and ribs, clad with planks. These materials were supplanted with metal in specialty racing yachts. In the 1960s [[fiberglass]] became a prevalent material. These materials and others continue in use.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Howard|first=Jim|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NB4uFQuUlnEC&newbks=0&printsec=frontcover&pg=PA7&dq=Cruising+boat&hl=en|title=Handbook of Offshore Cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising|last2=Doane|first2=Charles J.|date=2000|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-093-2|language=en}}</ref>\n\n* ''Wood'' construction, using conventional planks over ribs continues. Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique. Whereas yachts made with the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame\u2014provide a durable, lightweight and robust hull.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat. Both elements of construction are vulnerable to intrusion of water and the development of blisters.\n\n=== Rigs ===\n[[Gaff rig|Gaff rigs]] have been uncommon in the construction of cruising boats, since the mid 20th century. More common rigs are [[Bermuda rig|Bermuda]], [[Fractional rig|fractional]], [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]], and [[ketch]]. Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the [[yawl]], schooner, [[Wishbone rig|wishbone]], [[catboat]]. A survey of cruising sailors identified preferences for sloops, cutters, and ketches in equal measure.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nMost cruising yachts have masts of aluminum, which may be stepped (mounted) on the top of the keel inside the boat or on the top of the cabin, outside. A keel-stepped mast is better able to withstand a failure of its support ing [[standing rigging]], but requires a penetration of the cabin roof and the need for waterproofing. Masts have a variety of possible tracks for the mainsail to be attached and raised. Some allow for in-mast furling of the mainsail at the expense of aerodynamic efficiency of the mast and sail. Some booms allow for roller furling of mainsails.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Gear ===\n\n=== Accommodations ===\n\n=== Systems ===\n\n==Racing==\n{{Under construction|section=Description|placedby=HopsonRoad}}\nWorld Sailing recognizes nine classes of racing yacht:<ref>[http://www.sailing.org/classes/#isaf_sliding_tab_item_classes_index_yacht World Sailing classes of yachts].</ref>\n\n#[[Class40]]\n#[[Farr 30]]\n#[[Farr 40]]\n#[[International Maxi Association]]\n#[[J/111]]\n#[[IMOCA 60]]\n#[[Soto 40]]\n#[[Swan 45]]\n#[[Swan 60]]\n#[[TP 52]]\n#[[X-35 (yacht)|X-35]]\n#[[X-41 (yacht)|X-41]]\n\n==See also==\n{{commonscat-inline|Sailing yachts}}\n*[[Dinghy sailing]]\n*[[International class]]\n*[[List of large sailing yachts]]\n*[[Skiff|Sailing skiff]]\n{{International Sailing Federation Classes}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n[[Category:Sailing yachts]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 400\n\n | image1 = 2013_Ahmanson_Cup_Regatta_yacht_Zapata_II_b_photo_D_Ramey_Logan.jpg\n | alt1 = A cruising yacht\n | caption1 = A {{Convert|50|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} cruising yacht\n\n | image2 = 60feet IMOCA SAFRAN 01.JPG\n | alt2 = A racing yacht\n | caption2 = A {{Convert|60|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} [[IMOCA 60|IMOCA]] ocean racing yacht\n\n | footer = Cruising and racing yachts embody different tradeoffs between comfort and performance.\n}}\n\nA '''sailing yacht''' (US ship prefixes SY or S/Y), is a leisure craft that uses sails as its primary means of propulsion.

Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of yachts (''jaghts'' in Dutch) were already well-developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

Watertightness of connections, ports and hatches are key to staying afloat. [[Metacentric height|Stability]]\u2014the ability to return to an upright condition when upset by waves is another key aspect.\n* ''Performance'' hinges on a number of factors, including the waterline length (longer means faster), drag in the water (narrower hull with smooth appendages), hull shape, and sail shape and area.\n* ''Sea kindliness'' is an indicator of steering ease, directional stability and quelling of motion induced by wind and waves.\n\nThe displacement of a monohull cruising sailboat affects the above factors, as follows:<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n* ''Heavy displacement'' yachts with a displacement to length (D/L) ratio of 400+ have a long, deep keel and a protected propellor. They are stable, often roomy, are resistant to harm from groundings and floating obstacles, and have good sea kindliness, but lack speed.\n* ''Medium displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 300 typically have a separate keel and blended rudder support, which improves speed and maneuverability over the heavy displacement designs.\n* ''Light displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 200 typically have a fin keel and a spade rudder with a ballasted bulb. They have good speed, maneuverability, and ability to point into the wind. Their sea kindliness is less than the heavy and medium-displacement categories.\n\nMultihulls offer tradeoffs as cruising sailboats, compared with [[Monohull|monohulls]]. They may be catamarans or trimarans. They rely on form stability\u2014having separate hulls far apart\u2014for their resistance to capsize.<ref name=\":6\" /> Their advantages include greater: stability, speed, (for catamarans) living space, and shallower draft. Their drawbacks include: greater expenses, greater [[windage]], more difficult tacking under sail, less load capacity, and more maneuvering room required because of their broad beam. They come with a variety of sleeping accommodations and (for catamarans) bridge-deck configurations. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Tarjan, Gregor.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/233534126|title=Catamarans : the complete guide for cruising sailors|date=2008|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-159622-0|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=233534126}}</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\nTraditionally, all sailing yachts were made of wood, using a wooden keel and ribs, clad with planks. These materials were supplanted with metal in specialty racing yachts. In the 1960s [[fiberglass]] became a prevalent material. These materials and others continue in use.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Howard|first=Jim|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NB4uFQuUlnEC&newbks=0&printsec=frontcover&pg=PA7&dq=Cruising+boat&hl=en|title=Handbook of Offshore Cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising|last2=Doane|first2=Charles J.|date=2000|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-093-2|language=en}}</ref>\n\n* ''Wood'' construction, using conventional planks over ribs continues. Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique. Whereas yachts made with the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame\u2014provide a durable, lightweight and robust hull.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat. Both elements of construction are vulnerable to intrusion of water and the development of blisters.\n\n=== Rigs ===\n[[Gaff rig|Gaff rigs]] have been uncommon in the construction of cruising boats, since the mid 20th century. More common rigs are [[Bermuda rig|Bermuda]], [[Fractional rig|fractional]], [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]], and [[ketch]]. Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the [[yawl]], schooner, [[Wishbone rig|wishbone]], [[catboat]]. A survey of cruising sailors identified preferences for sloops, cutters, and ketches in equal measure.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nMost cruising yachts have masts of aluminum, which may be stepped (mounted) on the top of the keel inside the boat or on the top of the cabin, outside. A keel-stepped mast is better able to withstand a failure of its support ing [[standing rigging]], but requires a penetration of the cabin roof and the need for waterproofing. Masts have a variety of possible tracks for the mainsail to be attached and raised. Some allow for in-mast furling of the mainsail at the expense of aerodynamic efficiency of the mast and sail. Some booms allow for roller furling of mainsails.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Gear ===\n\n=== Accommodations ===\n\n=== Systems ===\n\n==Racing==\n{{Under construction|section=Description|placedby=HopsonRoad}}\nWorld Sailing recognizes nine classes of racing yacht:<ref>[http://www.sailing.org/classes/#isaf_sliding_tab_item_classes_index_yacht World Sailing classes of yachts].</ref>\n\n#[[Class40]]\n#[[Farr 30]]\n#[[Farr 40]]\n#[[International Maxi Association]]\n#[[J/111]]\n#[[IMOCA 60]]\n#[[Soto 40]]\n#[[Swan 45]]\n#[[Swan 60]]\n#[[TP 52]]\n#[[X-35 (yacht)|X-35]]\n#[[X-41 (yacht)|X-41]]\n\n==See also==\n{{commonscat-inline|Sailing yachts}}\n*[[Dinghy sailing]]\n*[[International class]]\n*[[List of large sailing yachts]]\n*[[Skiff|Sailing skiff]]\n{{International Sailing Federation Classes}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n[[Category:Sailing yachts]]\n", "name_user": "HopsonRoad", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCategories:,", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailing_yacht"}

J. Abrams]] and written by [[Roberto Orci]] and [[Alex Kurtzman]]. It is the eleventh film in the [[Star Trek (film series)|''Star Trek'' film franchise]], and is also a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] that features the main characters of the [[Star Trek: The Original Series|original ''Star Trek'' television series]] portrayed by a new cast, as the first in the rebooted film series. The film follows [[James T. Kirk]] ([[Chris Pine]]) and [[Spock]] ([[Zachary Quinto]]) aboard the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']] as they combat [[Nero (Star Trek)|Nero]] ([[Eric Bana]]), a [[Romulan]] from their future who threatens the [[United Federation of Planets]]. The story takes place in an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]]<ref name=\"MTVAlt1\" /><ref name=\"MTVAlt2\" /> because of [[time travel]] by both Nero and the original Spock ([[Leonard Nimoy]]). The alternate timeline was created in an attempt to free the film and the franchise from established [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] constraints while simultaneously preserving original story elements.\n\nThe idea for a prequel film which would follow the ''Star Trek'' characters during their time in [[Starfleet Academy]] was discussed by series creator [[Gene Roddenberry]] in 1968. The concept resurfaced in the late 1980s, when it was postulated by [[Harve Bennett]] as a possible plotline for what would become ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]'', but it was rejected in favor of other projects by Roddenberry. Following the critical and commercial failure of ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]'' and the cancellation of ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', the franchise's executive producer [[Rick Berman]] and screenwriter [[Erik Jendresen]] wrote an unproduced film titled ''Star Trek: The Beginning'', which would take place after ''Enterprise''. After the separation of [[Viacom (1952\u20132006)|Viacom]] and [[CBS Corporation]] in 2005, former [[Paramount Pictures]] president [[Gail Berman]] convinced CBS to allow Paramount to produce a new film in the franchise. Orci and Kurtzman, both fans of ''Star Trek'', were approached to write the film, and J. J. Abrams was approached to direct it. Kurtzman and Orci used inspiration from novels and graduate school dissertations, as well as the series itself. Principal photography commenced on November 7, 2007, and ended on March 27, 2008. The film was shot in various locations around California and Utah. Abrams wanted to avoid using bluescreen and greenscreen, opting to use sets and locations instead. Heavy secrecy surrounded the film's production and was under the fake working title ''Corporate Headquarters''. [[Industrial Light & Magic]] used digital ships for the film, as opposed to [[miniature effect|miniatures]] used in most of the previous films in the franchise. (''[[Star Trek: Insurrection]]'' used CGI for almost all ship shots.) Production for the film concluded by the end of 2008.\n\n''Star Trek'' was heavily promoted in the months preceding its release; pre-release screenings for the film premiered in select cities around the world, including [[Austin, Texas]], [[Sydney|Sydney, Australia]], and [[Calgary, Alberta]]. It was released in the United States and Canada on May 8, 2009, to critical acclaim; critics praised its character development, as well as its storyline, effects, acting, stunts, action sequences, direction, and Giacchino's musical score. The film was a box office success, grossing over $385.7 million worldwide against its $150 million production budget. It was nominated for several awards, including four [[Academy Awards]] at the [[82nd Academy Awards]], ultimately winning [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]], making it the first ''Star Trek'' film to win an Academy Award. It was followed by the [[sequel]]s ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'' and ''[[Star Trek Beyond]]'' in 2013 and 2016, respectively.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->\nIn the 23rd century, the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] [[starship]] USS ''Kelvin'' is investigating a \"lightning storm\" in space. A [[Romulan]] ship, ''Narada'', emerges from the storm and attacks the ''Kelvin''. ''Narada''{{'}}s [[Executive officer|first officer]], Ayel, demands that ''Kelvin''{{'}}s Captain Robau come aboard to negotiate a truce. Robau is questioned about the current [[stardate]] and an \"Ambassador [[Spock]]\", whom he does not recognize. ''Narada''{{'}}s commander, [[Nero (Star Trek)|Nero]], kills him, and resumes attacking the ''Kelvin''. George Kirk, ''Kelvin''{{'}}s first officer, orders the ship's personnel, including his pregnant wife Winona, to abandon ship while he pilots the ''Kelvin'' on a collision course with ''Narada''. Kirk sacrifices his life to ensure Winona's survival as she gives birth to [[James T. Kirk]].\n\nSeventeen years later on the planet [[Vulcan (Star Trek)#Homeworld|Vulcan]], a young Spock is accepted to join the Vulcan Science Academy. Realizing that the Academy views his human mother, Amanda, as a \"disadvantage\", he joins [[Starfleet]] instead. On [[Earth]], Kirk becomes a reckless but intelligent young adult. Following a bar fight with Starfleet cadets accompanying [[Uhura|Nyota Uhura]], Kirk meets Captain [[Christopher Pike (Star Trek)|Christopher Pike]], who encourages him to enlist in [[Starfleet Academy]], where Kirk meets and befriends doctor [[Leonard McCoy]].\n\nThree years later, Commander Spock accuses Kirk of cheating during the ''[[Kobayashi Maru]]'' simulation. Kirk argues that cheating was acceptable because the simulation was designed to be unbeatable. The disciplinary hearing is interrupted by a distress signal from Vulcan. With the primary fleet out of range, the cadets are mobilized. McCoy and Kirk board Pike's ship, the {{USS|Enterprise|NCC-1701|2}}. Realizing that the \"lightning storm\" observed near Vulcan is similar to the one that occurred when he was born, Kirk breaks protocol to convince Pike that the distress signal is a trap.\n\n''Enterprise'' arrives to find the fleet destroyed and ''Narada'' drilling into Vulcan's [[planetary core|core]]. ''Narada'' attacks ''Enterprise'' and Pike surrenders, delegating command of the ship to Spock and promoting Kirk to first officer. Kirk, [[Hikaru Sulu]], and [[chief engineer|Chief Engineer]] Olson perform a [[space diving|space jump]]<ref name=\"CNN.com\">{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Movies/05/08/the.scene.star.trek/index.html#cnnSTCText |title=The Scene: 'Trek' actors dive onto Vulcan |last=Cargill |first=J.D. |date=May 8, 2009 |website=CNN |accessdate=December 10, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"Bad Astronomy Review: Star Trek\">{{cite web |url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/05/08/ba-review-star-trek |title=BA Review: Star Trek |last=Plait |first=Phil |date=May 8, 2009 |work=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] |publisher=[[Kalmbach Publishing]] |accessdate=December 10, 2009}}</ref> onto the drilling platform. Olson is killed mid-jump, but Kirk and Sulu successfully reach and disable the drill. Despite ''Enterprise's'' efforts, Nero launches \"red matter\" into Vulcan's core, forming an artificial [[black hole]] that destroys Vulcan. ''Enterprise'' manages to rescue Spock's father, [[Sarek]], and the high council, but not Amanda, who falls to her death before the [[Transporter (Star Trek)|transporter]] can properly lock onto her.\n\nAs ''Narada'' moves toward Earth, Nero tortures Pike to gain access to Earth's defense codes. Spock maroons Kirk on Delta Vega after Kirk attempts [[mutiny]]. Kirk encounters an older Spock, who explains that he and Nero are from 129 years in the future. In that future, [[Romulan#Romulus|Romulus]] was threatened by a [[supernova]]. Spock's attempt to use \"red matter\" to create an artificial black hole and consume the supernova failed, and Nero's family perished along with Romulus. ''Narada'' and Spock's vessel were caught in the black hole, sending them back in time. Nero stranded Spock on Delta Vega to watch Vulcan's destruction.\n\nReaching a Starfleet outpost on Delta Vega, Kirk and the elder Spock meet [[Scotty (Star Trek)|Montgomery Scott]]. With the elder Spock's help, Scott devises a way for Kirk to [[Transporter (Star Trek)|beam]] onto ''Enterprise'' while it is travelling at warp speed. Following the elder Spock's advice, Kirk provokes younger Spock into attacking him, forcing Spock to recognize himself as emotionally compromised and relinquish command to Kirk. After talking with Sarek, Spock decides to help Kirk. While ''Enterprise'' hides itself within the gas clouds of [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], Kirk and Spock beam aboard ''Narada''. Kirk fights with Nero and Ayel, killing the latter and rescuing Pike, while Spock uses the elder Spock's ship to destroy the drill. Spock leads ''Narada'' away from Earth and sets his ship to collide with Nero's ship. ''Enterprise'' beams Kirk, Pike, and Spock aboard. The older Spock's ship and ''Narada'' collide, igniting the \"red matter\". Kirk offers Nero help to escape, but Nero refuses, prompting Kirk to give the order to fire, dooming ''Narada'' to be consumed in a black hole.\n\nKirk is promoted to Captain and given command of ''Enterprise'', while Pike is promoted to Rear Admiral. Spock encounters his older self, who persuades his younger self to continue serving in Starfleet, encouraging him to do, for once, what feels right instead of what is logical. Spock remains in Starfleet, becoming first officer under Kirk's command. ''Enterprise'' goes to warp as the elder Spock speaks the \"[[where no man has gone before|where no one has gone before]]\" monologue.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 190\n| footer    = From top to bottom: Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto and Zoe Saldana.\n| image1    = Chris Pine by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  =\n| image2    = Zachary Quinto by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  =\n| image3    = Zoe Saldana (Headshot).jpg\n| alt3      =\n| caption3  =\n}}\n* [[Chris Pine]] as [[James T.

Whereas the phaser blast noises from the television series were derived from ''[[The War of the Worlds (1953 film)|The War of the Worlds]]'' (1953), Burtt made his phaser sounds more like his blasters from ''Star Wars'', because Abrams' depiction of phasers were closer to the blasters' bullet-like fire, rather than the steady beams of energy in previous ''Star Trek'' films. Burtt reproduced the classic photon torpedo and warp drive sounds: he tapped a long spring against a [[contact microphone]], and combined that with cannon fire.

J. Abrams]] and written by [[Roberto Orci]] and [[Alex Kurtzman]]. It is the eleventh film in the [[Star Trek (film series)|''Star Trek'' film franchise]], and is also a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] that features the main characters of the [[Star Trek: The Original Series|original ''Star Trek'' television series]] portrayed by a new cast, as the first in the rebooted film series. The film follows [[James T. Kirk]] ([[Chris Pine]]) and [[Spock]] ([[Zachary Quinto]]) aboard the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']] as they combat [[Nero (Star Trek)|Nero]] ([[Eric Bana]]), a [[Romulan]] from their future who threatens the [[United Federation of Planets]]. The story takes place in an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]]<ref name=\"MTVAlt1\" /><ref name=\"MTVAlt2\" /> because of [[time travel]] by both Nero and the original Spock ([[Leonard Nimoy]]). The alternate timeline was created in an attempt to free the film and the franchise from established [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] constraints while simultaneously preserving original story elements.\n\nThe idea for a prequel film which would follow the ''Star Trek'' characters during their time in [[Starfleet Academy]] was discussed by series creator [[Gene Roddenberry]] in 1968. The concept resurfaced in the late 1980s, when it was postulated by [[Harve Bennett]] as a possible plotline for what would become ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]'', but it was rejected in favor of other projects by Roddenberry. Following the critical and commercial failure of ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]'' and the cancellation of ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', the franchise's executive producer [[Rick Berman]] and screenwriter [[Erik Jendresen]] wrote an unproduced film titled ''Star Trek: The Beginning'', which would take place after ''Enterprise''. After the separation of [[Viacom (1952\u20132006)|Viacom]] and [[CBS Corporation]] in 2005, former [[Paramount Pictures]] president [[Gail Berman]] convinced CBS to allow Paramount to produce a new film in the franchise. Orci and Kurtzman, both fans of ''Star Trek'', were approached to write the film, and J. J. Abrams was approached to direct it. Kurtzman and Orci used inspiration from novels and graduate school dissertations, as well as the series itself. Principal photography commenced on November 7, 2007, and ended on March 27, 2008. The film was shot in various locations around California and Utah. Abrams wanted to avoid using bluescreen and greenscreen, opting to use sets and locations instead. Heavy secrecy surrounded the film's production and was under the fake working title ''Corporate Headquarters''. [[Industrial Light & Magic]] used digital ships for the film, as opposed to [[miniature effect|miniatures]] used in most of the previous films in the franchise. (''[[Star Trek: Insurrection]]'' used CGI for almost all ship shots.) Production for the film concluded by the end of 2008.\n\n''Star Trek'' was heavily promoted in the months preceding its release; pre-release screenings for the film premiered in select cities around the world, including [[Austin, Texas]], [[Sydney|Sydney, Australia]], and [[Calgary, Alberta]]. It was released in the United States and Canada on May 8, 2009, to critical acclaim; critics praised its character development, as well as its storyline, effects, stunts, action sequences, direction, and Giacchino's musical score. The film was a box office success, grossing over $385.7 million worldwide against its $150 million production budget. It was nominated for several awards, including four [[Academy Awards]] at the [[82nd Academy Awards]], ultimately winning [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]], making it the first ''Star Trek'' film to win an Academy Award. It was followed by the [[sequel]]s ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'' and ''[[Star Trek Beyond]]'' in 2013 and 2016, respectively.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->\nIn the 23rd century, the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] [[starship]] USS ''Kelvin'' is investigating a \"lightning storm\" in space. A [[Romulan]] ship, ''Narada'', emerges from the storm and attacks the ''Kelvin''. ''Narada''{{'}}s [[Executive officer|first officer]], Ayel, demands that ''Kelvin''{{'}}s Captain Robau come aboard to negotiate a truce. Robau is questioned about the current [[stardate]] and an \"Ambassador [[Spock]]\", whom he does not recognize. ''Narada''{{'}}s commander, [[Nero (Star Trek)|Nero]], kills him, and resumes attacking the ''Kelvin''. George Kirk, ''Kelvin''{{'}}s first officer, orders the ship's personnel, including his pregnant wife Winona, to abandon ship while he pilots the ''Kelvin'' on a collision course with ''Narada''. Kirk sacrifices his life to ensure Winona's survival as she gives birth to [[James T. Kirk]].\n\nSeventeen years later on the planet [[Vulcan (Star Trek)#Homeworld|Vulcan]], a young Spock is accepted to join the Vulcan Science Academy. Realizing that the Academy views his human mother, Amanda, as a \"disadvantage\", he joins [[Starfleet]] instead. On [[Earth]], Kirk becomes a reckless but intelligent young adult. Following a bar fight with Starfleet cadets accompanying [[Uhura|Nyota Uhura]], Kirk meets Captain [[Christopher Pike (Star Trek)|Christopher Pike]], who encourages him to enlist in [[Starfleet Academy]], where Kirk meets and befriends doctor [[Leonard McCoy]].\n\nThree years later, Commander Spock accuses Kirk of cheating during the ''[[Kobayashi Maru]]'' simulation. Kirk argues that cheating was acceptable because the simulation was designed to be unbeatable. The disciplinary hearing is interrupted by a distress signal from Vulcan. With the primary fleet out of range, the cadets are mobilized. McCoy and Kirk board Pike's ship, the {{USS|Enterprise|NCC-1701|2}}. Realizing that the \"lightning storm\" observed near Vulcan is similar to the one that occurred when he was born, Kirk breaks protocol to convince Pike that the distress signal is a trap.\n\n''Enterprise'' arrives to find the fleet destroyed and ''Narada'' drilling into Vulcan's [[planetary core|core]]. ''Narada'' attacks ''Enterprise'' and Pike surrenders, delegating command of the ship to Spock and promoting Kirk to first officer. Kirk, [[Hikaru Sulu]], and [[chief engineer|Chief Engineer]] Olson perform a [[space diving|space jump]]<ref name=\"CNN.com\">{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Movies/05/08/the.scene.star.trek/index.html#cnnSTCText |title=The Scene: 'Trek' actors dive onto Vulcan |last=Cargill |first=J.D. |date=May 8, 2009 |website=CNN |accessdate=December 10, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"Bad Astronomy Review: Star Trek\">{{cite web |url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/05/08/ba-review-star-trek |title=BA Review: Star Trek |last=Plait |first=Phil |date=May 8, 2009 |work=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] |publisher=[[Kalmbach Publishing]] |accessdate=December 10, 2009}}</ref> onto the drilling platform. Olson is killed mid-jump, but Kirk and Sulu successfully reach and disable the drill. Despite ''Enterprise's'' efforts, Nero launches \"red matter\" into Vulcan's core, forming an artificial [[black hole]] that destroys Vulcan. ''Enterprise'' manages to rescue Spock's father, [[Sarek]], and the high council, but not Amanda, who falls to her death before the [[Transporter (Star Trek)|transporter]] can properly lock onto her.\n\nAs ''Narada'' moves toward Earth, Nero tortures Pike to gain access to Earth's defense codes. Spock maroons Kirk on Delta Vega after Kirk attempts [[mutiny]]. Kirk encounters an older Spock, who explains that he and Nero are from 129 years in the future. In that future, [[Romulan#Romulus|Romulus]] was threatened by a [[supernova]]. Spock's attempt to use \"red matter\" to create an artificial black hole and consume the supernova failed, and Nero's family perished along with Romulus. ''Narada'' and Spock's vessel were caught in the black hole, sending them back in time. Nero stranded Spock on Delta Vega to watch Vulcan's destruction.\n\nReaching a Starfleet outpost on Delta Vega, Kirk and the elder Spock meet [[Scotty (Star Trek)|Montgomery Scott]]. With the elder Spock's help, Scott devises a way for Kirk to [[Transporter (Star Trek)|beam]] onto ''Enterprise'' while it is travelling at warp speed. Following the elder Spock's advice, Kirk provokes younger Spock into attacking him, forcing Spock to recognize himself as emotionally compromised and relinquish command to Kirk. After talking with Sarek, Spock decides to help Kirk. While ''Enterprise'' hides itself within the gas clouds of [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], Kirk and Spock beam aboard ''Narada''. Kirk fights with Nero and Ayel, killing the latter and rescuing Pike, while Spock uses the elder Spock's ship to destroy the drill. Spock leads ''Narada'' away from Earth and sets his ship to collide with Nero's ship. ''Enterprise'' beams Kirk, Pike, and Spock aboard. The older Spock's ship and ''Narada'' collide, igniting the \"red matter\". Kirk offers Nero help to escape, but Nero refuses, prompting Kirk to give the order to fire, dooming ''Narada'' to be consumed in a black hole.\n\nKirk is promoted to Captain and given command of ''Enterprise'', while Pike is promoted to Rear Admiral. Spock encounters his older self, who persuades his younger self to continue serving in Starfleet, encouraging him to do, for once, what feels right instead of what is logical. Spock remains in Starfleet, becoming first officer under Kirk's command. ''Enterprise'' goes to warp as the elder Spock speaks the \"[[where no man has gone before|where no one has gone before]]\" monologue.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 190\n| footer    = From top to bottom: Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto and Zoe Saldana.\n| image1    = Chris Pine by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  =\n| image2    = Zachary Quinto by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  =\n| image3    = Zoe Saldana (Headshot).jpg\n| alt3      =\n| caption3  =\n}}\n* [[Chris Pine]] as [[James T.
