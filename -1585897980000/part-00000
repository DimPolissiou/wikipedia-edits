Thaddeus Thomas (Harry Belafonte), a wealthy CEO, prompts a discussion about white people and claims they are \"genetically inferior\" because the children grow up without fathers. In this alternative reality, the lower class consists of [[White Americans]] as the large percentage of minorities who live in rundown and crime-infested ghetto communities, and face [[prejudice]] from the broader society; while the comfortable middle-to-upper class is predominantly made of African Americans. The [[African Americans]] in the film are dominant in employment, business, and entertainment and they often refer condescendingly to how white children live in poverty and unfortunate conditions. The rich Thomas family are horrified and struggle to be polite in the presence of poor white people.\n\nIn an effort to go above and beyond in his position, Louis Pinnock (John Travolta), a struggling factory worker hoping for a promotion in the candy factory, offers to deliver a package after his shift. He delivers the package to successful CEO Thaddeus Thomas, who lives in a wealthy upper-class community predominantly made up of blacks. Pinnock is let into the property by a white servant at the security gate point in front of the Thomas residence and accidentally views Thomas's wife naked while dressing in her bedroom through the window. Thomas notices and complains to the VP at the factory, during a dinner engagement at his house, that he would prefer a different delivery man instead of a \"Peeping Tom\" to visit his house next time. Although Thomas does not suggest any form of punishment towards Pinnock, the VP \"gets the message\" and immediately fires Pinnock anyway. Pinnock returns to the Thomas residence in an attempt to discuss the misunderstanding with Thomas, but because Thomas is in an important business meeting, he refuses and sends a message to Pinnock that he apologizes, but there is nothing that he can do to help him. Pinnock begs for two minutes of his time, but is abruptly turned away.\n\nWithout any education or advanced skills, Pinnock finds difficulty getting a job and is unable to support his family. The Pinnock family are awakened one early morning by the police who are accompanied by the landlord to enforce eviction from the house; in mid-chaos the family struggle to gather their important belongings as they vacate the premises. Pinnock's mother-in-law scolds and belittles Louis for being a failure of a man and not taking care of his family; she clearly states that there is not enough room for him at her house and his wife and two children leave to live with her.\n\nAs if the situation could not get any worse, Pinnock's truck breaks down and he is forced to walk. Feeling down and lonely in the middle of the night, Pinnock is aggressively apprehended by the police, who mistake him for a bank robber because \"he fit the description\". The people inside the bar come outside and shout at the police, demanding that they leave Pinnock alone. Pinnock is brutally beaten by the police for causing a commotion and the police are chased away, as beer bottles are being thrown by the angry mob.\n\nIn a radical quest for justice, Pinnock waits outside the Thomas residence again, kidnaps Thomas at gunpoint and demands a large sum of money that he believes is owed him for losing his job. After multiple failed attempts to withdraw the money, Pinnock holds Thomas hostage for the weekend and takes him through the ghetto where he lives. Thomas, however, remains unsympathetic to Pinnock and calls him a failure who blames the world for his problems. But Pinnock takes Thomas through the ghetto anyway, and Thomas alternates between enjoying some of the staples of ghetto life (Pinnock shows him how to use salt to enhance the flavor of ketchup with French fries) and having his eyes open to this world's racism (black cops are hostile to Pinnock, treat him like a criminal when as far as they know he has done nothing wrong, and eventually beat him up for no good reason). In the end, though, mistakenly believed to be carrying a weapon by the police, Pinnock is shot and killed by them in an attempt to call for help for Thomas, who is in desperate need of medical attention because of breathing problems.\n\nThe chastened CEO visits Pinnock's grieving widow and offers her the money that Louis lost when he was fired. She refuses it, and when Thomas awkwardly asks if she wants more, she bluntly says \"How much would ever be enough?\" and closes the door in his face as the movie ends.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Travolta]] as Louis Pinnock\n* [[Harry Belafonte]] as Thaddeus Thomas\n* [[Kelly Lynch]] as Marsha Pinnock\n* [[Margaret Avery]] as Megan Thomas\n* [[Tom Bower (actor)|Tom Bower]] as Stanley\n* [[Andrew Lawrence (actor)|Andrew Lawrence]] as Donnie Pinnock\n* [[Bumper Robinson]] as Martin\n* [[Tom Wright (actor)|Tom Wright]] as Lionel\n* [[Sheryl Lee Ralph]] as  Roberta\n* [[Judith Drake (actress)|Judith Drake]] as Dorothy\n* [[Robert Gossett]] as John\n* [[Wesley Thompson]] as Williams\n* [[Tom Nolan (actor)|Tom Nolan]] as Johansson\n* [[Willie C.

He soon recovers and enjoys his hospital stay as respite from the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|RICO]] trial. Tony recognizes this as a potential advantage and convinces Junior to feign [[dementia]] during his competency hearings. He gives a good performance, but begins exhibiting actual signs of dementia in private.\n\n[[Ralph Cifaretto|Ralphie]]'s 12-year-old son Justin is hit in the chest with an arrow while play-acting ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' with a friend, resulting in significant blood loss and brain damage. Delivering a wad of cash to Tony, Ralphie cries openly. Tony tells him he is now seeing [[Valentina La Paz|Valentina]]; Ralphie smiles and pats his cheek. Expressing a desire for some kind of redemption, he meets with [[Father Phil Intintola|Father Phil]] and establishes a scholarship at [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]] in [[Jackie Aprile, Jr.|Jackie Jr.]]'s name. Everyone sympathizes with him except [[Paulie Gualtieri|Paulie]]: his mother recently received a traumatic prank phone call, and he suspects that it was from Ralphie, retaliating against Paulie for [[The Weight (The Sopranos)|ratting him out to Johnny]].   \n\nThere is a fire at the stables, thought to have been caused by an electrical fault. Pie-O-My is badly burned and has to be euthanized. Tony immediately suspects Ralphie, and confronts him at his home over the suspicious timing of the fire: there will be a $200,000 insurance pay-out. Ralphie vehemently denies the accusation, but their argument escalates into a physical fight, leading to Tony killing Ralphie with his bare hands. He calls [[Christopher Moltisanti|Christopher]] to help with the clean-up. A doped-up Chris arrives late and helps Tony [[dismemberment|dismember]] Ralphie's body, then dispose of his remains in separate locations. Tony never outright admits to Chris that he murdered Ralphie, and Chris never expresses outright suspicion. After completing the disposal, they clean up at the [[Bada Bing]], where Tony passes out and wakes up alone the following morning.\n\n==Deceased==\n*  Pie-O-My and several other horses: Killed in a stable fire. Cause is deemed accidental by insurance company.\n* [[Ralph Cifaretto]]: beaten and strangled to death by Tony Soprano due to suspicion that he caused the fire that killed Pie-O-My, which Ralph denies. His body is then [[Dismemberment|dismembered]] and [[Decapitation|decapitated]] with the help of Christopher Moltisanti.\n\n==Title reference==\n* Tony uses the phrase \"whoever did this\" when discussing with Christopher who exactly was responsible for Ralphie's death.

He soon recovers and enjoys his hospital stay as respite from the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|RICO]] trial. Tony recognizes this as a potential advantage and convinces Junior to feign [[dementia]] during his competency hearings. He gives a good performance, but begins exhibiting actual signs of dementia in private.\n\n[[Ralph Cifaretto|Ralphie]]'s 12-year-old son Justin is hit in the chest with an arrow while play-acting ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' with a friend, resulting in significant blood loss and brain damage. Delivering a wad of cash to Tony, Ralphie cries openly. Tony tells him he is now seeing [[Valentina La Paz|Valentina]]; Ralphie smiles and pats his cheek. Expressing a desire for some kind of redemption, he meets with [[Father Phil Intintola|Father Phil]] and establishes a scholarship at [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]] in [[Jackie Aprile, Jr.|Jackie Jr.]]'s name. Everyone sympathizes with him except [[Paulie Gualtieri|Paulie]]: his mother recently received a traumatic prank phone call, and he suspects that it was from Ralphie, retaliating against Paulie for [[The Weight (The Sopranos)|ratting him out to Johnny]].   \n\nThere is a fire at the stables, thought to have been caused by an electrical fault. Pie-O-My is badly burned and has to be euthanized. Tony immediately suspects Ralphie, and confronts him at his home over the suspicious timing of the fire: there will be a $200,000 insurance pay-out. Ralphie vehemently denies the accusation, but their argument escalates into a physical fight, leading to Tony killing Ralphie with his bare hands. He calls [[Christopher Moltisanti|Christopher]] to help with the clean-up. A doped-up Chris arrives late and helps Tony [[dismemberment|dismember]] Ralphie's body, then dispose of his remains in separate locations. Tony never outright admits to Chris that he murdered Ralphie, and Chris never expresses outright suspicion. After completing the disposal, they clean up at the [[Bada Bing]], where Tony passes out and wakes up alone the following morning.\n\n==Deceased==\n*  Pie-O-My and several other horses: Killed in a stable fire. Cause is deemed accidental by insurance company.\n* [[Ralph Cifaretto]]: beaten and strangled to death by Tony Soprano due to suspicion that he caused the fire that killed Pie-O-My, which Ralph denies. His body is then [[Dismemberment|dismembered]] and [[Decapitation|decapitated]] with the help of Christopher Moltisanti.\n\n==Title reference==\n* Tony uses the phrase \"whoever did this\" when discussing with Christopher who exactly was responsible for Ralphie's death.

The 'Ronde du Postillon' in the opera, (\"[[Mes amis, \u00e9coutez l'histoire]]\"), is considered one of the most difficult tenor arias in all of opera, as it calls for a demanding high D from the soloist.\n\nAn early appraisal of Gedda's singing was offered by [[Walter Legge]], after first hearing Gedda sing for the role of ''Dmitry'' in a planned recording of ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]''.\n<blockquote>On my arrival at the airport I was asked by a swarm of journalists if I were not interested in hearing their excellent young Swedish voices. Naturally I was interested, but I did not expect either the front page stories that appeared next morning or the mass of letters and almost incessant telephone calls asking to be heard. I had to ask the Director of the Opera for a room for a couple of days to hear about 100 young aspirants. The first to sing to me (at 9.30 in the morning) was Gedda who had, I believe, sung only once in public. He sang the ''[[Carmen]]'' Flower Song so tenderly yet passionately that I was moved almost to tears. He delivered the difficult rising scale ending with a clear and brilliant B flat. Almost apologetically I asked him to try to sing it as written \u2013 ''pianissimo, rallentando'' and ''diminuendo''. Without turning a hair he achieved the near-miracle, incredibly beautifully and without effort. I asked him to come back at 8 that evening and sent word to my wife that a great singer had fallen into my lap and to [[Issay Dobrowen|Dobrowen]] that, believe it or not, this 23-year-old Gedda was the heaven-sent Dmitry for our Boris.<ref>[[Walter Legge|Legge, Walter]] (1998).

The 'Ronde du Postillon' in the opera, (\"[[Mes amis, \u00e9coutez l'histoire]]\"), is considered one of the most difficult tenor arias in all of opera, as it calls for a demanding high D from the soloist.\n\nAn early appraisal of Gedda's singing was offered by [[Walter Legge]], after first hearing Gedda sing for the role of ''Dmitry'' in a planned recording of ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]''.\n<blockquote>On my arrival at the airport I was asked by a swarm of journalists if I were not interested in hearing their excellent young Swedish voices. Naturally I was interested, but I did not expect either the front page stories that appeared next morning or the mass of letters and almost incessant telephone calls asking to be heard. I had to ask the Director of the Opera for a room for a couple of days to hear about 100 young aspirants. The first to sing to me (at 9.30 in the morning) was Gedda who had, I believe, sung only once in public. He sang the ''[[Carmen]]'' Flower Song so tenderly yet passionately that I was moved almost to tears. He delivered the difficult rising scale ending with a clear and brilliant B flat. Almost apologetically I asked him to try to sing it as written \u2013 ''pianissimo, rallentando'' and ''diminuendo''. Without turning a hair he achieved the near-miracle, incredibly beautifully and without effort. I asked him to come back at 8 that evening and sent word to my wife that a great singer had fallen into my lap and to [[Issay Dobrowen|Dobrowen]] that, believe it or not, this 23-year-old Gedda was the heaven-sent Dmitry for our Boris.<ref>[[Walter Legge|Legge, Walter]] (1998).
